It
is generally assumed that tethering enhances rates of electron
harvesting and delivery to active sites in multidomain enzymes by
proximity and sampling mechanisms. Here, we explore this idea in a
tethered 3-domain, trimeric copper-containing nitrite reductase. By
reverse engineering, we find that tethering does not enhance the rate
of electron delivery from its pendant cytochrome c to the catalytic copper-containing core. Using a linker that harbors
a gatekeeper tyrosine in a nitrite access channel, the tethered haem
domain enables catalysis by other mechanisms. Tethering communicates
the redox state of the haem to the distant T2Cu center that helps
initiate substrate binding for catalysis. It also tunes copper reduction
potentials, suppresses reductive enzyme inactivation, enhances enzyme
affinity for substrate, and promotes intercopper electron transfer.
Tethering has multiple unanticipated beneficial roles, the combination
of which fine-tunes function beyond simplistic mechanisms expected
from proximity and restrictive sampling models.

Introduction
Transient protein–protein
interactions are central to cellular
function and are often linked with interprotein electron transfer
events.1,2 While protein–protein complexes are
ubiquitous in biology, there are a number of cases where redox partner
proteins that are known to interact in a transient manner are found
tethered in a single polypeptide chain.3,4 Understanding
how and why redox partner proteins are tethered in nature and how
tethering impacts on enzyme catalysis is of fundamental importance,
as well as being key for the development of novel tethered enzymes
for use in biocatalytic and synthetic biology applications.5,6 With an increased number of studies on the few known naturally occurring
tethered systems (e.g., P450 BM37 and nitric
oxide synthase8,9) in recent years, flexible domain
tethering has been shown to play a role in reducing the conformational
search space and increasing the population of productive electron
transfer configurations. However, as synthetic tethered systems are
challenging to design and are often inefficient,6 there is a need to understand why and how nature uses tethered
modular enzyme architectures for biological catalysis.

Copper-containing
nitrite reductases (CuNiRs) are a highly conserved
group of enzymes that are naturally found both tethered and separated
from their redox partner proteins.4,10,11 They are highly suited for systematic study to establish
the role of redox partner tethering (Figure 1A,B). CuNiRs use electrons generated through
denitrification to catalyze one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO2–) to form nitric oxide (NO): NO2– + 2H+ + e– ↔
NO + H2O.12 For nearly 30 years,
2-domain copper-containing nitrite reductases have been extensively
studied by computational, structural, and biophysical methods.13−19 Irrespective of organism, these CuNiRs are trimeric enzymes, with
each monomer containing two copper centers housed within discrete
β-sandwich cupredoxin domains, with the catalytic copper, T2Cu,
at the dimer interface (Figure 1A). From a mechanistic viewpoint, 2-domain CuNiRs catalyze
the reduction of NO2– to NO by transferring
electrons that originate from the partner proteins (pseudo)azurin
(PAz/Az) or cytochrome c (cyt c),
through a T1Cu center to a catalytic T2Cu. T1Cu to T2Cu electron transfer
occurs by proton coupled electron transfer (PCET).13,20,21 Like in many redox proteins,22−24 the interaction between 2-domain CuNiRs and their partner proteins
is transient, and conformational search mechanisms involving electrostatic
steering are required for successful electron exchange.25

cyan. The isolated cyt c551 protein is

shown in (C), the three monomers in the structure of RpNiR are shown as green, magenta, and cyan. The isolated RpNiR cyt c protein is shown in yellow.

In recent years, a newly discovered class of 3-domain
CuNiRs has
been described and structurally characterized (Figure 1B).4,10,11 These 3-domain CuNiRs are widespread in nature and have very similar
core structures to the 2-domain CuNiRs but are found with either an
Az or a cyt c partner protein fused at the N- or
C-terminus of the enzyme, respectively. We have reported a 1.01 Å
resolution structure of a 3-domain CuNiR from the denitrifying bacteria Ralstonia pickettii (RpNiR),10 which contains a C-terminal cyt c domain fused to the CuNiR core portion (Figure 1B). This domain proximity in RpNiR might enhance electron transfer between the fused portions of
the enzyme. The 3-domain RpNiR has a number of differences
to its 2-domain counterparts. These include the presence of Tyr323
(conserved among cyt c tethered 3-domain NiRs), which
is located on the linker connecting the haem domain to the core domain,
blocking the nitrite binding site, and hydrogen bonding to Asp97,
an essential residue in the catalytic pocket. The T2Cu site has two
water molecules, one of which is ligated to the T2Cu and another that
is hydrogen bonded to this water and also Tyr323. The protein has
a single water channel between two monomers, which is blocked by a
His residue in 2-domain NiRs.

We have now synthetically deconstructed RpNiR
into its constituent domains, namely the core CuNiR portion and cytochrome c (Figure 1C). We have also exchanged Tyr323 for Ala, Glu, and Phe residues
in full-length RpNiR to identify the role of Tyr323
and the linker region in substrate access and binding. The deconstructed
proteins were studied using biophysical and structural methods alongside
the prototypic and well-characterized 2-domain CuNiR (Alcaligenes xylosoxidans NiR; AxNiR) and full-length RpNiR to identify the significance
of tethering to RpNiR catalysis. Surprisingly, our
data show that tethering does not enhance the rate of electron delivery
from haem to T1Cu, a property that was expected from in silico models
based on the full-length RpNiR crystal structure
and the binary complex of a 2-domain AxNIR with its
cognate partner cyt c551.10,25 Here, we show the unexpected and combined importance of the tethered
haem domain and linker that harbors the Tyr323 gatekeeper residue
to RpNiR catalysis. The effects of tethering are
multiple, impacting on mechanisms of long-range redox communication,
redox potential modulation, suppression of enzyme inactivation by
reductant, electron transfer, activation of the catalytic site, and
overall catalysis. Our approach provides a general methodology to
discover functional advantages of tethering in other multidomain redox
enzyme systems.

Results and Discussion
Reverse Engineering of RpNiR into its Functional
Constituent Domains
RpNiR was deconstructed
into its constituent catalytic core and cytochrome portions by carefully
examining its sequence and structure in comparison with 2-domain CuNiRs
(Figure S1). With these constituent proteins
and their biophysical characterization (Figure S2), we set out to investigate the functional consequences
of tethering in RpNiR catalysis.

First, to
assess the impact of removal of the cytochrome c domain
on the structure of the RpNiR-core, we solved the
structure of the “as-isolated” and “nitrite-bound” RpNiR-core protein at 2.25 and 1.89 Å resolutions,
respectively (Table 1). A comparison with the full-length RpNiR structure
reveals a number of interesting features. Specifically, the linker
region, which connects the core portion to the cytochrome c domain is now unravelled, making a β-strand adjacent
to the surface strand of the neighboring molecule, facilitated by
formation of a salt bridge between Tyr323 and Glu44 from the adjacent
monomer (Figure 2A–C).
This new location of the linker region shows a high degree of similarity
to other 2-domain CuNiR reductases, which lack Tyr323. Moreover, structures
of the RpNiR-core protein show a more compact trimer
than the full-length RpNiR (Figure S3), a feature that is attributed to the altered conformation
of Ile245 (Figure 2D,E), which interrupts solvent entry via the RpNiR
channel. The general tightness of the deconstructed core is visible
from an ∼1.6 Å inward movement of the β-strands
to the center of the trimeric unit when compared to the full-length
protein (Figure S3). Repositioning of Tyr323
and the linker opens up the blocked substrate access channel and changes
the conformation of second sphere residues around the T2Cu site similar
to 2-domain NiRs. These changes in conformation of the proton channel
residues in the RpNiR-core protein resemble those
observed in the only other structurally determined cytochrome-fused
CuNiR, the enzyme from Pseudoalteromanas haloplanktis (PhNiR) (Figure 2F).26 We infer, therefore
that the full-length structures of RpNiR and PhNiR represent two distinct conformations of these tethered
complexes.

Contrary to full-length RpNiR crystals, we were
able to soak nitrite into the RpNiR-core crystals
to obtain a nitrite-bound structure.27 The
“nitrite-bound” RpNiR-core X-ray structure
contains 2 trimers in the asymmetric unit and shows different ligands
at the T2Cu sites. Sites A and F have two waters bound to T2Cu similar
to full-length RpNiR (Figure 3A); four other sites have nitrite bound in
two conformations, a “top-hat” (sites C and B) (Figure 3B and Figure S4) and a “side-on” conformation
(sites D and F) (Figure 3C and Figure S4). This variation in nitrite
binding from “top-hat” to “side-on” coincides
with rearrangement of the solvent above the T2Cu site (Figure 3B,C) and stronger hydrogen
bonding of the nitrite and water ligands to both His240 and Asp97.
Similar conformations of nitrite were observed recently in Achromobacter cycloclases 2-domain CuNiR (AcNiR) structures during in-crystallo enzyme-catalysis studied
by serial crystallography.28

and water molecules are small red spheres. A 2Fo-Fc electron density
map is contoured at the 1.0σ level for the T1Cu and T2Cu sites

Tether Residue Tyr 323 is a Gatekeeper for Nitrite Binding
We were unable to obtain the structure of the RpNiR-core protein with Tyr323 locked in the active site in a manner
similar to that observed in the full-length RpNiR.10,27 We were also unable to obtain a structure of full-length RpNiR with nitrite bound. Consequently, three variants of
full-length RpNiR were generated (Y323A/F/E) to investigate
the role of residue Tyr323 for nitrite access to and binding at the
T2Cu site (Table 1).
These variants have specific activities for nitrite reduction that
are similar (∼90%) to wild type full-length protein. We solved
crystal structures of these variants in “as-isolated”
and “nitrite-bound” forms. In all of these structures,
the main chain position of residue 323 does not change in comparison
with native RpNiR. In the “as-isolated”
Y323A/E variant structures, water W1 is coordinated by T2Cu and hydrogen-bonded
to W2. Both waters are found in a similar position as those of native RpNiR (Figure 3D–F). Water W1 is also within hydrogen bond distance to both
Asp97 and His240. For variants Y323A and Y323E, the water molecules
occupying free space above T2Cu are connected by strong hydrogen bonds,
while the channel space, opposite to the RpNiR-core,
is open and contains full occupancy waters (Figure 3E,F), one of which, W3, ligates to Asp97.
The Y323F variant has a single water, W1, bound to T2Cu site. The
absence of a second water molecule creates space available above W1
despite the presence of Phe323 in a position similar to Tyr323 of
the native protein (Figure S5). In crystals
treated with nitrite, we observed nitrite replacing waters W1 and
W2 in the Y323A and Y323E variants and water W1 in the Y323F variant
(Figure 3G–I).
Interestingly, the Y323A variant shows a previously unobserved “inverse-hat”
binding mode for nitrite, while both Y323F and Y323E variants have
nitrite bound in a “side-on” conformation (Figure S4). The ability of crystals of these
variants to bind nitrite despite retention of the linker loop in a
“locked-down” position27 similar
to that was previously observed in the full-length protein demonstrates
the importance of both the nature of residue at position 323 (Tyr)
and the position of the linker in controlling substrate access and
binding.

Haem to T1Cu Electron Transfer is Limited by Haem Domain Conformational
Sampling
To investigate the consequences of tethering in RpNiR, we measured the kinetics and thermodynamics of the
haem to T1Cu electron transfer reaction. This was accomplished by
measuring the redox potentials of the haem and copper centers (Table 2 and Figures S6–S9) and the haem to T1Cu electron transfer
rates in RpNiR and its constituent domains (Figure S10–11).

The midpoint
reduction potentials of the haem and T1Cu in full-length RpNiR are similar (290 and 266 mV, respectively). The haem
to T1Cu edge-to-edge distance in the X-ray crystal structure of full-length RpNiR is 10.1 Å (Figure 4A). In this situation, electron transfer rates would
be fast (ca. 109 s–1 for nonadiabatic
electron transfer) unless limited by other factors, such as conformational
search mechanisms.29 Conformational search
mechanisms are often used to find optimal geometries for electron
transfer in biological systems, especially large multidomain redox
systems.30,31 We therefore set out to establish if such
mechanisms might limit the observed rate of haem to T1Cu electron
transfer in RpNiR.

We used a flash photolysis method
to observe electron transfer
from reduced haem to the T1Cu center in RpNiR (Figure 4B). In this method,
electrons are rapidly injected into the haem center following laser
excitation of NADH20,32 (the electron donor). The subsequent
electron transfer reaction from haem to T1Cu is slow (16.8 ±
2.0 s–1). Moreover, only a small fraction (<5%;
expected to be 38% based on midpoint reduction potential) of electrons
delivered to the haem center are transferred to the T1Cu center. This
indicates that the thermodynamic equilibrium predicted from the measured
reduction potentials of the T1Cu and haem centers is not attained,
indicating the possibility of conformational differences between the
tethered domains.

Domain motions have been inferred to facilitate
electron transfer
from tethered domains to the core CuNiR portion in 3-domain CuNiRs.10,11,33 Slow rates of electron transfer
from haem to T1Cu in RpNiR are consistent with localized
and rate-limiting searches of conformational space in the tethered
protein, required to optimize electronic coupling between the haem
and T1Cu centers. This sampling of multiple conformations to find
reactive geometries is consistent with published X-ray scattering
data for RpNiR,33 which
had placed the tethered domains far away from the core 2-domain assembly.
The structural rearrangement of the Tyr323 linker observed in the
high-resolution crystallographic structure of the RpNiR-core has enabled construction of a model of full-length RpNiR that provides a much-improved simulation of the SAXS
data. It provides a more reliable model of an extended structure utilizing
the position of the linker region in the RpNiR-core
protein, placing the three cytochrome domains with three haem to T1Cu
separations of 28, 38, and 52 Å. This new model of RpNiR shows that the cyt c domains are highly solvent
exposed and distant from the core structure in an extended conformation.
We would expect an ensemble of heam-T1Cu distances, which vary around
an average of 40 Å as the domains move (Figure 4C–E and Figure S12). The model shown in Figure 4D is however an exceptionally good fit to the experimental
data, suggesting that this extended conformation (with small variation)
is where the molecule resides most of the time in solution. These
observations emphasize the importance of large-scale domain dynamics
in RpNiR catalysis.

To gain further knowledge
of the potential benefits of tethering,
we compared rates of intraprotein electron transfer from haem to T1Cu
in full-length RpNiR with those from the untethered
haem domain to the RpNiR-core protein. Electron transfer
rates were also investigated in the naturally occurring 2-domain AxNiR. For the genetically deconstructed and natural 2-domain
NiRs, we used a stopped-flow method in which excess 2-domain CuNiR
was rapidly mixed with reduced cyt c protein; the
reaction progress was monitored using the haem Soret band (Figure S10). Observed rates of reaction were
dependent linearly on RpNiR-core protein concentration,
indicating interprotein electron transfer occurs through transient
formation of a protein–protein complex (Figure 4F). Also, the natural 2-component AxNiR–cyt c551 system
transfers electrons ca 3-fold more effectively than
the genetically deconstructed 2-component system.

Redox driving
forces for haem to copper electron transfer in the
natural 2-domain AxNiR–cyt c551 and genetically deconstructed RpNiR
proteins are similar (Table 2). Modest differences in second-order rate constants for genetically
deconstructed RpNiR and the natural AxNiR–cyt c551 complexes are likely
to be attributed to altered reactive geometries of the respective
protein–protein complexes or alternative positioning of the
linker region. To ascertain if tethering in RpNiR
improves the rate of electron transfer compared to 2-domain AxNiR, rate constants for electron transfer were calculated
for 2-domain AxNiR at protein concentrations that
represent the average concentration of proteins found in R. pickettii or A. xylosoxidans. This was accomplished using the protein abundance database tool
PaxDb.34 At these average protein concentrations,
we found that tethering would provide little benefit over the 2-component AxNiR system for haem to T1Cu electron transfer (Table 3). There are differences
in redox potential for T1Cu (e.g., full-length RpNiR compared to the constituent RpNiR domains) that
will alter the overall redox driving force for electron transfer (Table 2). However, as these
reactions are limited by conformational sampling (tethered RpNiR system) or collision and interacting-surface rolling
(2-component systems), small differences in midpoint redox potential
should not affect observed rates of haem to T1Cu electron transfer.

Nitrite Binding and Enzyme Turnover is Controlled
by Haem Reduction
and Prevents RpNiR Inactivation
The lack
of effect on T2Cu hyperfine feature shows that nitrite does not bind
to oxidized RpNiR23 (Figure 5A). It is therefore
not possible to determine electron transfer rates from haem to T1Cu
in “preloaded” nitrite-bound native RpNiR. We did however investigate electron transfer from reduced haem
to the RpNiR copper centers in the presence of nitrite
contained in the assay buffer using our flash photolysis assay. These
electron transfer reactions were investigated at different concentrations
of nitrite contained in the assay solution (Figure S11). With nitrite present, two kinetic phases (compared to
the single phase in absence of nitrite) were observed for haem to
T1Cu electron transfer. With nitrite, there is also an increase in
the number of electrons transferred from the haem to the T1Cu center
(Figure S11). This suggests that nitrite
facilitates electron flow from the haem domain to the copper centers
by increasing the redox potential of the T2Cu center and enabling
electron transfer to occur from T1Cu to T2Cu.35 We also found that preincubation of native RpNiR
with the strong reductant dithionite reduces the haem domain selectively,
but this treatment does not inactivate RpNiR. This
contrasts to the well-documented situation with 2-domain NiRs, where
dithionite-reduction of the T2Cu in the absence of nitrite leads to
enzyme inactivation mediated by dissociation of the water ligated
to the T2Cu.36−38 Due to the absence of a lack of dithionite-reduced
structure of RpNiR, the precise mechanism responsible
for this difference cannot be established, but it is likely to arise
from the position of Tyr323 in the catalytic pocket and the associated
conformation of the linker.

are shown in Table 4. (C) UV–vis spectra of oxidized (black) and 1-electron reduced

for the reaction between 1-electron reduced RpNiR
and nitrite. The Ks value for nitrite
binding measured by UV–vis spectral titration is 3.7 ×
10–3 ± 0.3 × 10–3 mM,
and the Ks and klim values for the nitrite dependent stopped-flow are 3.5 ×
10–3 ± 1.2 × 10–3 mM
and 0.34 ± 0.02 s–1, respectively.

We attribute the slow phase observed in flash photolysis
studies
of RpNiR to the binding of nitrite at the T2Cu site
following rapid reduction of the haem by photoactivated NADH. When
nitrite is unavailable, RpNiR is protected from inactivation
by preventing electron flow from the reduced haem center to T1Cu as
noted above (<5% T1Cu is reduced compared to 38% expected on the
basis of midpoint reduction potential). The process of substrate binding
in RpNiR is an even more highly coordinated sequence
of events than 2-domain CuNiRs, protecting the enzyme against reductive
inactivation when nitrite is not available.37,38

Inter-Cu Electron Transfer in the Catalytic Core of RpNiR Mimics that of 2-Domain AxNiR
We investigated
intercopper electron transfer by monitoring the electron
transfer rate from T1Cu to T2Cu and its nitrite-dependence. These
studies were performed with the RpNiR-core protein
because the dominant haem absorption feature masks the T1Cu features
in full-length RpNiR (Figure S2). Laser flash was used to rapidly transfer electrons from
NADH to the T1Cu center. Subsequent electron transfer from the T1Cu
to the T2Cu as a new equilibrium became established was monitored
by absorption spectrophotometry to report on the oxidation state of
the T1Cu center (Figure S13).13,20 In the absence of nitrite, T1Cu to T2Cu electron transfer did not
occur in the RpNiR-core protein, consistent with
measured midpoint reduction potentials of the RpNiR-core
protein (+331 mV and +243 mV for T1 and T2Cu centers, respectively; Table 2), which are within
the same range as those previously reported for the 2-domain Pseudomonas chlororaphis CuNiR, though different
from the AxNiR for the T1Cu site.13,39

Two
discrete kinetic phases were observed for RpNiR-core
intercopper electron transfer in the presence of the nitrite substrate
(Figure S13). The faster of the two phases
shows a nitrite dependence that is similar to the native 2-domain AxNiR.20 At low concentrations
of nitrite, the rate of electron transfer is fast, but inhibition
is observed at higher nitrite concentrations (Figure S13). The slower kinetic phase shows a hyperbolic dependence
on nitrite concentration. Kinetic parameters associated with this
phase are similar to those determined for steady-state assays of the RpNiR-core protein (Table 4 and 5; Figure 5B
and S13). This second phase is likely to
be rate-limiting in steady-state turnover of the RpNiR-core protein. In native 2-domain CuNiRs and full-length RpNiR, intercopper electron transfer is not rate limiting
in steady-state turnover (Figure 5), but it can become so in selected variant forms (e.g.,
residues targeted in the substrate access channel).15 The fast phase is not seen in the Y323F variant of the RpNiR-core in the presence of nitrite. In the RpNiR-core protein, the two phases might relate to multiple conformational
states. Studies with the RpNiR-core have established
rates for intercopper electron transfer in RpNiR
and revealed a complex nitrite dependence similar to that of 2 domain AxNiR.20

Tethering Influences Overall
Steady-state Catalysis in RpNiR
We investigated
the effects of tethering
using steady-state turnover assays with full-length and genetically
deconstructed RpNiR proteins. Comparisons were made
also to 2-domain AxNiR (Table 4; Figure 5B). RpNiR shows Michaelis–Menten
behavior over a range of nitrite concentrations (up to 50 mM). By
contrast, the RpNiR-core protein shows inhibition
at high nitrite concentrations (beyond 10 mM). Similar inhibition
has been observed in AxNiR variants, where active
site residues involved in PCET (e.g., Asn90) were modified by site-directed
mutagenesis.13 A consequence of tethering
is that this nitrite inhibition is suppressed in full-length RpNiR.

Kinetic parameters are shown in Table 4. Like other 2-domain CuNiRs, AxNiR has a low apparent nitrite affinity (KM = 2.1 × 10–2 ± 0.2 ×
10–2 mM) and high turnover (kcat = 202.7 ± 0.7 s–1) value. It is
important to compare these with corresponding values for RpNiR and the RpNiR-core proteins. The core protein
has a relatively weak affinity for nitrite (4.1 × 10–1 ± 1.6 × 10–1 mM). Conversely, the full-length RpNiR has a higher relative affinity for nitrite (KM = 1.6 × 10–3 ±
0.2 × 10–3 mM). The RpNiR-core
protein is an inefficient nitrite reductase (kcat/KM values ca. 1500 times lower
than AxNiR). Full-length RpNiR,
by contrast, is a relatively efficient enzyme (kcat/KM = 6.9 × 102 ± 0.9 × 102 mM–1 s–1) despite having an ∼200-fold lower kcat value than that of the AxNiR. The difference
in Michaelis constant for nitrite observed for full-length and core RpNiR proteins is consistent with a requirement to reduce
the RpNiR haem in order to facilitate nitrite binding
at the T2Cu center.

Nitrite does not bind to oxidized full-length RpNiR but can bind to 2-domain CuNiRs and RpNiR-core
proteins (Figure 5A).
In titration experiments, nitrite binds tightly to the one-electron
reduced state (Ks = 3.7 × 10–3 ± 0.3 × 10–3 mM) but
only when the tethered haem domain is reduced (Figure 5D). We confirmed this finding by performing
catalytic turnover of prereduced RpNiR under single
turnover conditions in a stopped-flow device. Using dithionite, we
titrated a single electron into RpNiR, which remained
localized at the haem (Figure 5C). Electron flow from the haem to the copper centers was
then triggered by addition of nitrite. This confirms that nitrite
binding triggers the flow of electrons to the T2Cu site via the T1Cu
and thus facilitates catalysis, consistent with single turnover flash
photolysis studies. Stopped-flow measurements were performed at different
nitrite concentrations to determine nitrite-binding affinity to 1-electron
reduced RpNiR (Figure 5D; Figure S14). The apparent
affinity (3.5 × 10–3 ± 1.2 × 10–3 mM; stopped-flow studies) and the apparent Michaelis
constant (1.6 × 10–3 ± 0.2 × 10–3 mM; conventional steady-state kinetic assays) are
similar to the dissociation constant (3.7 × 10–3 ± 0.3 × 10–3 mM; static titration) for
nitrite-bound one-electron-reduced RpNiR. The data
indicate that the limiting rate constant (klim) for oxidation of RpNiR with nitrite is three times
lower than the recorded steady-state per RpNiR monomer,
consistent with only one of the three monomeric units found within
the RpNiR protein to be active during turnover or
a “one-third site reactivity” mechanism for RpNiR (see the Supporting Information for further discussion).25,40 Altogether, stopped-flow
and spectral titration data presented here confirm the importance
of haem reduction prior to events that trigger substrate access and
binding for catalysis to occur.

Conclusions
On
the basis of our findings, we propose a mechanism for RpNiR in which the haem domain and linker region containing
Tyr323 are important to RpNiR catalysis. The structure
of the genetically obtained core enzyme shows that the linker region
containing Tyr323 can unravel dramatically in a manner that maps onto
the extended conformation obtained from SAXS of the intact RpNiR molecule placing the tethered domain at >30 Å
from T1Cu. One-electron reduction of the cytochrome domain facilitates
both nitrite binding and a conformational search that is necessary
for the cytochrome domain to interact effectively with the core portion
of RpNiR. These structural changes facilitate haem
to T1Cu electron transfer.

In principle, electron transfer to
the T2Cu could either be concerted
or sequential with respect to nitrite binding, but a concerted mechanism,
facilitated by a repositioning of the gatekeeper Tyr323 residue, would
seem the most plausible mechanism. Repositioning of Tyr323 may in
part be aided by the conformational changes accompanying reduction
of the haem. This could then unblock the substrate access channel
to provide access for nitrite to the T2Cu catalytic site. Unblocking
of the substrate access channel can also be accomplished by directed
mutagenesis. The structures of variants reported here show that this
is accomplished without any rearrangement of the linker in the compact
tethered RpNiR.

Premature electron transfer
to the T2Cu site is prevented when
nitrite is unavailable. This suppresses the reductive inactivation
of RpNiR at the T2Cu site by mechanisms that have
been documented in the natural 2-domain CuNiRs.35 Genetic deconstruction of RpNiR into its
constituent domains has provided additional insights. Electron transfer
in the RpNiR-core protein indicates that nitrite
can bind to the T2Cu site in the oxidized form of the proteins and
that intercopper electron transfer is rate limiting in catalysis.
This is fundamentally different to the RpNiR full-length
protein, where nitrite does not bind to the oxidized enzyme.

To conclude, our study has revealed a complex and subtle interplay
implicating long-range structural transitions facilitated by haem
reduction to deliver electrons and nitrite to the T2Cu catalytic site
in RpNiR. This coordinated action is only possible
because of the tethered structure of RpNiR. These
subtle and beneficial effects on catalysis as reflected by very high
affinity for nitrite suggest that laboratory-based improvement design
through simple domain fusions will not suffice in the development
of efficient redox enzymes. Instead, a more intricate design strategy
should be used in which the multiple roles of tethering are considered.
This would then open up redox partner tethering to improve catalysis
through a multitude of previously unforeseen mechanisms.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
All reagents were of analytical grade and
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, apart from NADH, which was purchased
from Melford (Ipswich, UK). All spectroscopic measurements were performed
in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). For anaerobic measurements,
all buffers were degassed with N2 before being introduced
into the anaerobic glovebox (<5 ppm of O2). Prior to
performing anaerobic spectroscopic measurements, protein samples were
taken into the glovebox, oxidized with a few grains of potassium ferricyanide,
and passed down a Bio-Rad Econo-Pac 10DG-desalting column equilibrated
with anaerobic buffer.

Molecular Biology Methods
Codon
optimized nirK genes encoding full-length wild-type
(WT) and truncated portions
of RpNiR were synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Paisley, UK). For periplasmic haem c incorporation
in both WT and the isolated cyt c portion of RpNiR, the gene encoding the RpNiR N-terminal
leader sequence was added at the 5′ end of the NiR genes. Synthesized
genes for full-length RpNiR and the cyt c domain were cloned into the pET22b vector between Nde I and Xho I restriction sites, while the genes
for the core regions were cloned into the pETM-11 expression vector
between the Nco I and the Nde I
sites by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher Scientific Paisley, UK). All genes
inserted into pET22b included a 3′ sequence encoding for a
TEV cleavage site, which was used to remove the C-terminal His-tag
following protein purification.

To generate the Y323F RpNiR-core variant, the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
and protocol from New England BioLabs (Hitchin, UK) were used with
the forward (5′-TTT CTG GGT GAT CGT GCA GCA C-3′) and
reverse (5′-AAC GCT ATC CAG TTC TTT ACC GCT ATA CA-3′)
custom primers ordered from Eurofins Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany).
All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins Genomics,
Ebersberg, Germany).

NirK genes encoding full-length
Y323A/E/F RpNiR mutants were synthesized and cloned
into pET26b vector
between Nde I and Xho I restriction
sites by GenScript (USA).

Expression and Purification of Proteins
E. coli strain C41(DE3) cells were
used to express
WT RpNiR. Briefly, the haem maturation plasmid, pEC86,
and the pET22b plasmid containing the C-terminal His-tagged RpNiR genes were transformed into C41(DE3) cells and grown
in 0.5 L of Terrific Broth media at 30 °C. Once an optical density
at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6 was attained, the culture incubation
temperature was dropped to 20 °C and cells were supplemented
with 0.1 mM CuSO4, 0.3 mM 5-aminolevulinic acid, and 0.3
mM IPTG. Cultures were incubated overnight and subsequently, cells
were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were stored at −20
°C prior to performing purification steps.

WT RpNiR was purified using nickel affinity chromatography. Briefly, cell
lysates contained in 40 mM MOPS (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, and 40 mM imidazole
buffered solutions were loaded onto a HisTrap HP nickel-charged IMAC
column from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, U.K.) equilibrated with
the same buffer. RpNiR was eluted from the column
using 200 mM imidazole. For removal of the C-terminal His-tag, RpNiR was passed down a desalting column equilibrated with
50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT before being incubated
overnight with a His-tagged TEV protease at room temperature. Following
proteolytic cleavage, TEV protease was separated from RpNiR by using a reverse nickel affinity purification step and RpNiR proteins were supplemented with copper by incubating
protein solutions with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM CuSO4 for 2 h at room temperature. Following a final desalting
step to remove excess CuSO4, RpNiR was
flash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C.
Variant forms of RpNiR were purified using a similar
procedure.

For RpNiR-core protein expression,
a pETM-11 plasmid
encoding the N-terminal His-tagged protein was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells and grown in 0.5 L
of terrific broth media incubated at 30 °C. After cell cultures
attained an OD600 of 0.6, cells were supplemented with
0.1 mM CuSO4 and the incubation temperature was dropped
to 20 °C. RpNiR-core protein expression was
induced by addition of IPTG (final concentration 0.5 mM). Cultures
were incubated overnight and harvested the following morning by centrifugation.
Cell pellets were stored at −20 °C. The RpNiR-core proteins were purified using the same protocols described
above for the WT RpNiR protein.

The cyt c portion of RpNiR was
expressed and purified using the same protocol described for WT RpNiR except that CuSO4 was excluded during recombinant
protein expression and purification. The 2-domain copper-containing
nitrite reductase from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (AxNiR), the cyt c551 protein from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, and N-terminal His-tag tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease were expressed
and purified by following previously published protocols.41,42

For Y323A/E/F full-length RpNiR variant expression,
a pET26b plasmid encompassing the DNA of the Y323 variant was transformed
into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells
containing the pEC86 vector (used for c-type haem maturation). Cells
were grown in 1 L of modified Terrific Broth medium, containing 24
g yeast extract, 12 g tryptone, 10 g NaCl, and 2 mL of glycerol at
37 °C. At an OD600 of 0.8, 0.1 mM CuSO4 and 1 mg of Hemin were added to the medium and cultures were left
to incubate overnight at 16 °C. Following expression, cells were
harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C until
purification.

All Y323A/E/F purification steps were performed
at 4 °C. Harvested
cells were sonicated in 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.4) buffer, containing
cocktail protease inhibitor (Roche, Hertfordshire, UK) and subsequently
centrifuged to remove the insoluble fraction. Cell lysates were applied
to a DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris
HCl (pH 8.4). The red-colored band, symbolic of the RpNiR protein, was monitored when eluting RpNiR with
a 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.4) buffer, containing 50 mM NaCl. The eluted
protein was passed down a Superdex200 gel filtration column equilibrated
with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 200 mM NaCl. To monitor the RpNiR elution, an ÄKTA pure system (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalford, UK) was used and 280 and 410 nm wavelengths were
selected to track the presence of protein and the haem soret band,
respectively. Eluted fractions were dialyzed overnight against 20
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM CuSO4, for reconstitution
of T2Cu sites and reapplied onto Superdex200 gel filtration column
to attain the RpNiR trimer.

Crystallography
Crystallization
The C2221 crystal form of the RpNiR-core protein
was obtained by mixing 2 μL of
a 10 mg/mL protein solution present in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 100
mM NaCl with similar amount of reservoir solution containing 0.2 M
MgCl2, and 20% P6000 in MES buffer (pH 6.0). Crystals grew
at 4 °C over a 2-day period. For formation of the nitrite complex,
crystals were soaked in 100 mM nitrite, which was added to the reservoir
solution. Crystals were flash-frozen in the same solution they were
grown in which was supplemented with 20% glycerol, as a cryo-protectant.

Crystals for full-length RpNiR-Y323E and Y323A
variants were obtained in H3 crystal form, and crystal for Y323F variant
appeared in I213 at 4 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion
method. For crystallization of the RpNiR variants,
2 μL of 10 mg/mL protein solution present in 20 mM Tris-HCl
and 200 mM NaCl (pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir
solution containing 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.50, 20% PEG 3350, 0.2 M sodium
citrate) and equilibrated over 500 μL of the reservoir solution.
To obtain RpNiR-nitrite complexes in the full-length
variants, crystals were incubated in the reservoir solution with 200
mM sodium nitrite. All crystals were cryo-protected in reservoir or
soaking solutions containing 15% glycerol and flash cooled in liquid
N2.

Data Collection, Structure Solution, and
Refinement
For the “as-isolated” RpNiR-core variant,
data were collected at Barkla X-ray laboratory a Rigaku FR-E+ Super-Bright
rotating anode generator with an EIGER R 4M detector with 1.54 Å
wavelength. “Nitrite-bound” RpNiR-core
data were collected at IO4–1 beamline (Diamond Synchrotron,
UK) using Pilatus 6M-F detector and 0.91587 Å wavelength. Data
for Y323A-“as-isolated”, Y323A-NO2–, Y323E-NO2–, and Y323F-NO2– were collected at the I24 Diamond Synchrotron
using a Pilatus 6M-F detector and 0.96861 Å wavelength. Data
for Y323F-“as-isolated” were collected at the IO3 beamline,
Diamond Synchrotron using a Pilatus3–6M detector and 0.9686
Å wavelength. Data for Y323E-“as-isolated” were
collected at the PROXIMA1 beamline (SOLEIL synchrotron, France) using
a PILATUS 6M detector. All data were collected ca. 100 K. Data were
integrated by DIALS43 and scaled by Aimless.44 Structure of RpNiR-core was
solved by molecular replacement using MOLREP45 with the core region of full-length wild-type RpNiR (PDB ID: 3ZWI) (residues 4–344) as the starting model. When there was no
isomorphous model available, structures of Y323A/E/F RpNiR variants were solved by molecular replacement, using the full-length
wild-type RpNiR model (PDB ID: 3ZWI). Where a similar
model was available, data were reindexed to match the orientation
of the model in CCP446 followed by refinement
with REFMAC5.47 Refinement was iterated
with manual model building in COOT.48 TLS
refinement was implemented at the last stage of the refinement as
hydrogen atoms were placed in riding positions. The quality of the
model was assessed in PDBDEP. Data collection and refinement statistics
are shown in Table 1.

Protein Modeling Based on Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
C-terminal cytochrome domains were appended to the RpNiR-core structure and allowed to move freely throughout several
torsion angle molecular dynamics simulations using CNS.49 The core structure was fixed, and the globular
cytochrome domain treated as a rigid body. The scattering curves of
structures generated throughout these simulations were compared to
experimental scattering data for RpNiR collected
and published previously33 using FoXS for
Mac.50 Distance distribution functions
were calculated with ScÅtter (Robert Rambo, DIAMOND, UK).

Nitrite
Reductase Activity Measurements
Nitrite Reductase Activity
Measurements Using a NO Electrode
The nitrite reductase activity
measurements were carried out in
an anaerobic glovebox under a nitrogen +1.5% hydrogen gas atmosphere.
The reaction was started by adding 1 μL of purified protein
at a concentration of 5 mg/mL to a total volume of 3 mL of the assay
reaction mixture consisting of 50 mM MES, pH 6.5, 250 μM phenazine
methosulfate, 5 mM sodium ascorbate, and 5 mM sodium nitrite in a
reaction vessel equipped with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature.
The nitric oxide produced from the reaction was detected by a nitric
oxide electrode (ISO-NOP World Precision Instruments, Serasota, USA).
NO concentrations were determined by comparison with calibration curves
of known concentrations of NO.

Nitrite Reductase Activity
Measurements Monitoring Dithionite
Oxidation
The conversion of nitrite to nitric oxide by NiR
was followed using a previously published method by monitoring the
oxidation of sodium dithionite.20,33 Briefly, all steady-state
activity measurements were carried out at 10 °C in an anaerobic
glovebox (<5 ppm of O2) using 0.1 mM phenazine methylsulfate
(PMS) reduced by 0.5 mM sodium dithionite as the electron donor. All
assays contained catalytic amounts of NiR (10–50 nM). To maintain
ionic strength across the nitrite range used in the measurements,
KCl was used to ensure [KCl] + [KNO2] = 50 mM.

For
each assay, NiR and nitrite was mixed with a reactant solution of
PMS and sodium dithionite and the depletion in the sodium dithionite
absorbance at 315 nm (Δε315 8 mM–1cm–1) was used to determine the activity of NiR
proteins. The linear regions of progress curves were used to obtain
initial velocities, which were fitted to the Michaelis–Menten
equation after considering the NiR concentration (eq 1) by using OriginPro 9.1 software. 1  When substrate
inhibition
was observed, data were fitted to a modified version of the Michaelis–Menten
equation (eq 2), where Ki is the dissociation constant for the enzyme–inhibitor
complex. 2  

Rapid Mixing Stopped-Flow
Spectroscopy
The rate of
interprotein electron transfer from Axcyt c551 to AxNiR and from RpNiR-cyt c domain to RpNiR-core was monitored under single-turnover conditions using stopped-flow
spectroscopy. All assays were conducted at 10 °C in an Applied
Photophysics SC18MV spectrometer housed within an anaerobic glovebox
(<5 ppm of O2). To reduce the haem in RpNiR-cyt c for stopped-flow studies, an excess of
sodium dithionite was mixed with the protein before the sample was
passed down a desalting column to remove surplus reducing agent. For
each measurement, 1 μM (final concentration) of the reduced RpNiR-cyt c domain was mixed with a range
of NiR or core proteins (final concentration 10–80 μM).
Reactions were monitored by recording the change in absorbance at
the haem Soret peak (417–420 nm). Exponential decay functions
were fitted to reaction transients. Plots of observed rate constant
versus concentration were fitted to linear functions to determine
second-order rate constants for reactions using OriginPro 9.1.

Laser
Flash Spectroscopy
A laser flash spectroscopy
method was used to monitor intraprotein haem to T1Cu and T1Cu to T2Cu
electron transfer in RpNiR and the genetically deconstructed RpNiR, respectively. There is potential complexity in using
the laser flash approach to study haem to T1Cu electron transfer,
in that solvated electrons generated by laser uncaging of NADH could
in principle transfer to all three redox centers of RpNiR. However, the majority of the electrons generated by laser excitation
are transferred to the haem cofactor under the conditions used. This
is expected given that the haem domain is the most solvent accessible
and has a higher redox potential compared to the other copper centers
(Table 2).10 Also, we demonstrated that if RpNiR is titrated against sodium dithionite to the level of one reducing
equivalent, the electron is located on the haem (Figure 5C). All samples were prepared
in an anaerobic glovebox (<5 ppm of O2) under dim red
light. Samples containing 200 μM NADH, 50 mM N-methyl nicotinamide (NMN), RpNiR protein, and various
concentrations of KNO2 were made up in a quartz cuvette,
sealed with a rubber Suba-seal stopper, and taken from the glovebox
for laser flash analysis. The ionic strength was maintained constant
using additional KCl such that [KCl] + [KNO2] = 50 mM.

Laser flash measurements were performed at 10 °C using methods
previously described.20 Briefly, samples
were excited at 355 nm using the third harmonic of a Q-switch Nd:YAG
laser (Brilliant B, Quantel) and spectral changes associated with
the haem c (418 nm; full-length RpNiR) or the T1Cu (600 nm; genetically deconstructed core protein)
were used to monitor rates of electron transfer. Acquired transients
were fitted to exponential decay functions and plots of the dependence
of these observed rate constants on nitrite concentration were analyzed
by fitting to a modified version of the hyperbolic functions (eq 3) using OriginPro 9.1.
In eq 3, klim is the limiting rate constant, Ks is the saturation constant, krev is the reverse rate of reaction, and Ki is the dissociation constant. 3  

EPR and Redox Potentiometry
The reduction potentials
of the haem c, the T1Cu, and the T2Cu in the various
NiR/cyc c551 proteins were determined
by electrochemical titration. NiR/cyt c protein was
titrated against sodium dithionite. To facilitate communication between
the electrode and the protein, mediators were used. Between each addition
of sodium dithionite the electrode potential was allowed to stabilize.
The electrochemical potential of the solution was measured using a
Thermo Orion ORP electrode at 25 °C. A factor of +207 mV was
used to correct values to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). During
titration against dithionite, UV–vis absorbance spectra were
recorded using a Cary UV-50 Bio UV–visible scanning spectrophotometer
and samples (300 μL) were withdrawn for EPR analysis. Samples
were placed in 4 mm Suprasil quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad LabGlass) and
sealed with a Suba-seal rubber stopper and immediately frozen in liquid
N2.. Samples were stored in liquid N2 to prevent
reoxidation until they were analyzed. Continuous wave X-band EPR spectra
(∼ 9.4 GHz) were recorded using a Bruker ELEXSYS E580 EPR spectrometer
(Bruker GmbH, Rheinstetten, Germany). Temperature was maintained using
an Oxford Instruments ESR900 helium flow cryostat coupled to an ITC
503 controller from the same manufacturer. EPR experiments were carried
out at 20 K and employed 0.5 mW microwave power, 100 kHz modulation
frequency, and 5 G (0.5 mT) modulation amplitude.

Redox potentials
of the copper and haem centers were determined by fitting data to
the Nernst eq (eq 4): 4  where Eh is the measured
potential, Em is the midpoint potential
of the cofactor, R is
the gas constant (8.31 J K–1 mol–1), T is the temperature in K, n is the number of electrons, F is the Faraday constant
(96.5 kJ V–1 mol–1) and [ox] and
[red] are the concentrations of oxidized and reduced enzyme, respectively.
