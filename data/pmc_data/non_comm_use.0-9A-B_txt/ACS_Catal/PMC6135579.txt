Asymmetric
aldol addition of simple aldehydes and ketones to electrophiles
is a cornerstone reaction for the synthesis of unusual sugars and
chiral building blocks. We investigated d-fructose-6-phosphate
aldolase from E. coli (FSA) D6X variants
as catalysts for the aldol additions of ethanal and nonfunctionalized
linear and cyclic aliphatic ketones as nucleophiles to nonphosphorylated
hydroxyaldehydes. Thus, addition of propanone, cyclobutanone, cyclopentanone,
or ethanal to 3-hydroxypropanal or (S)- or (R)-3-hydroxybutanal catalyzed by FSA D6H and D6Q variants
furnished rare deoxysugars in 8–77% isolated yields with high
stereoselectivity (97:3 dr and >95% ee).

Introduction
Crossed aldol additions
of simple aliphatic aldehydes and ketones
to electrophiles are important transformations in organic synthesis.
The asymmetric version enables access to a range of interesting unusual
carbohydrates and important chiral building blocks for the preparation
of naturally occurring and synthetic bioactive products, including
pharmaceuticals.1−8 These conversions are, however, cumbersome because of notorious
side reactions such as polymerization, homo aldolization, and aldol
condensation, as well as low stereoselectivity.6,9,10 Enzymatic C–C bond formation mediated
by aldolases is a very attractive alternative for this purpose, because
of its unparalleled high stereoselectivity, avoidance of extensive
protective group chemistry, and operation under mild conditions.11−14 A typical disadvantage of these enzymes is their rather narrow scope
of acceptable nucleophilic substrates, whereas they tolerate a broad
variety of aldehydes as the electrophilic components.

The class
I d-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from E.
coli (FSA, EC 4.1.2.−) and variants with
minimal mutations on selected residues within its active site, showed
an unprecedented tolerance toward a large structural variety of nucleophilic
and electrophilic substrates.15−30 This unveiled its extraordinary malleability beyond the boundaries
of currently known aldolases. Furthermore, we recently uncovered that
ethanal, propanone, butanone, and cyclopentanone are acceptable as
nucleophilic components for wild-type FSA and its D6H variant when l- and d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) are the electrophiles.31 Nevertheless, the corresponding nonphosphorylated
analogues reacted sluggishly or failed to furnish an aldol adduct.

In this work, we show that engineered variants FSA D6X32 catalyze aldol additions of ethanal (1a), linear (1b–d), and cyclic (1e–g) simple aliphatic ketones to nonphosphorylated
hydroxyaldehyde derivatives (2a–c) (Figure 1), expanding
the synthetic utility to rare and unusual sugar derivatives as well
as related chiral building blocks.

Results and Discussion
Models of FSA wild-type in complex
with the K85-d-fructose-6-phosphate
(Fru6P) imine and the K85-dihydroxyacetone (DHA) enamine plus d-G3P show that these substrate intermediates can establish
direct contacts with Y131, N28, and D6 residues of the active site
(Figure 2). These models
suggested that residue D6 can interact via hydrogen-bonding both with
the CH2OH group of nucleophiles such as DHA and with the
C2-OH of d-G3P, thereby influencing both the nucleophile
and electrophile selectivity.33−35 To break the hydrogen bonding
pattern of D6, this residue was targeted for site directed mutagenesis
to obtain FSA variants with tolerance toward aldol additions of 1a and ketones 1b–g as nucleophiles
to nonphosphorylated hydroxyaldehydes. Thus, individual FSA D6X variants
were produced, where X = hydrophobic (A and L), polar charged (E and
H), or polar uncharged (N, Q, S, and T) amino acids. Variants L107A,
L163A, and A165G, which had been identified in earlier studies to
benefit the nucleophile and electrophile substrate tolerance, were
also screened.16,22

Figure 2 Molecular models of FSA-bound DHA-enamine/d-G3P (A) and
Fru6P-imine (B) intermediates. In both cases, the D6 residue is forming
two hydrogen bonds with the C2 hydroxyl group of the d-G3P and the hydroxymethyl group of the
DHA (A), or the corresponding C3 and C5 hydroxyl groups of Fru6P (B).

In the standard aldol addition
of DHA to d,l-G3P,
only the activity of FSA D6N was found to be comparable to that of
FSA wild-type (45.4 ± 0.1 U mg–1 vs 46.0 ±
0.1 U mg–1, respectively). Indeed, asparagine is
isosteric to aspartate and able to establish similar hydrogen bonding
interactions, which explains why no dramatic changes on the activity
were observed. On the other hand, for all other D6X replacements,
only very low activity was detected (between 0.72 ± 0.01 to 0.03
± 0.01 U mg–1) (Table S2 in SI), confirming the critical importance of aspartate for binding
of hydroxylated nucleophiles.

We began testing the panel of
ketone nucleophiles 1b–g, in a concentration
range between 100 mM to
20% v/v, optimized for each nucleophile, with a selection of 3-hydroxyaldehyde
electrophiles 2a,b (80 mM) (Scheme 1) using FSA D6X variants as
catalysts. Electrophiles 2a,b have the advantage
to shift reaction equilibrium by cyclic hemiketal formation of the
product. Moreover, 2b would introduce a chiral center
as internal stereochemical reference (Scheme 1). We started with 3-hydroxypropanal (2a) and the ketone nucleophiles in aqueous 50 mM triethanolamine
buffer pH 8, similar to the conditions used in our previous communication.31 D6X variants where X = A, T, or H were identified
as the most effective ones for the addition of 1b (2.0
M, 15% v/v) to 2a, based on TLC analysis (Table S3). Compound 3b was isolated
in 32% yield using FSA D6H as catalyst (Scheme 1A, Table 1). No reaction was detected for the addition of 1c–g to 2a with any of the
FSA variants screened. Increasing the concentration of 1c–g up to 20% v/v, to compensate for potentially
low KM values, was unfruitful. Furthermore,
in a second round of protein engineering we combined L107A, L163A,
and A165G mutations with selected D6X mutations, i.e. X = L, H, or
E. However, no positive hits were found (Table S3).

(S)-3-Hydroxybutanal (S-2b) gave intense new spots on TLC in the aldol additions
of: 1b (15% v/v) using FSA D6X, where X = A, L, N, Q,
S, T, E,
and H; 1e (5% v/v) using FSA D6L and D6H; and 1f (5% v/v) using FSA D6N and D6H (Table S3). The common active variant, FSA D6H, furnished 4b, 4e, and 4f in 25%, 22%, and 8% isolated yields,
respectively (Scheme 1B, Table 1).

(R)-3-Hydroxybutanal (R-2b) was tested with 1b (15% v/v) to check whether
it was also substrate of FSA D6X catalysts. The best variant (i.e.,
FSA D6H) gave the expected lactol 5b (Scheme 1C, Table 1). However, lower yields were achieved as
compared with S-2b, suggesting some
degree of enantiomeric discrimination.31

Next, we studied the addition of ethanal (1a)
to electrophiles 2a,b. It was observed that
test reactions carried
out at 15%–20% v/v of 1a yielded a mixture of
products arising from its nonenzymatic self-aldolization.36 It is likely that the electrophilic reactivity
of 1a inactivated the enzyme and just the spontaneous
chemical reaction took place. Indeed, at 100 mM concentration of 1a, the addition to S- and R-2b catalyzed by FSA D6H and D6N yielded the desired
aldol product. The common active variant, FSA D6H, furnished 4a and 5a in 27% and 14% isolated yields, respectively
(Scheme 1B,C, Table 1). In the case of 2a, the double mutant FSA D6L/A165G was active for the addition
of 1a at 5% v/v, rendering 3a in 4% isolated
yield (Table 1).

2-Hydroxyethanal was also tested as electrophile with all nucleophiles 1a-g, but it was not converted in the desired
sense by any FSA variant. Thus, the O-protected derivative, 2-benzyloxyethanal (2c), was considered
as synthetic equivalent, which we reported as a good electrophile
for aldol additions of DHA and HA catalyzed by FSA.22,25 For additions to 2c, D6N and D6Q variants gave the
highest conversions (95%) when the electrophile was 1b (15% v/v), whereas only FSA D6Q gave acceptable conversions (53%)
when it was 1e (5% v/v) (Table S3). Accordingly, FSA D6Q furnished 6b in 77% and 6e+7e in 10% isolated yields (Scheme 1D, Table 1). No product was formed for all other nucleophiles
with any of the FSA variants.

Butanone (1c), 3-pentanone
(1d) , and
cyclohexanone (1g) were not accepted as nucleophiles
by any of the FSA variants assayed with any of the electrophiles.
Most probably this is due to steric interactions that difficult a
proper orientation for the electrophiles and/or the nucleophiles.
It is noteworthy that 1c was tolerated as nucleophile
with l-G3P electrophile;31 however
the latter is one of the most reactive electrophiles, which could
compensate for the lower activity of 1c.

In none
of the reactions involving 1a as nucleophile,
neither homoaldol addition nor trimerization reactions were observed.
This is in contrast with what was seen with 2-deoxy-d-ribose-5-phosphate
aldolase Escherichia coli (DERAEcoli).37 Furthermore,
no reactions were detected with any nucleophile/electrophile pair
in control experiments performed with FSA wild-type and the inactive
the inactive FSA K85M variant.

Stereoselectivity is an issue
of paramount importance in these
reactions. Formation of d-threo aldol adducts
has been reported using catalysis by wild-type FSA and variants, practically
irrespective of structural variations of nucleophile and electrophile.
Moreover, the attack of FSA-enamine nucleophile invariably takes place
from its si-face, for steric reasons and with no
exceptions hitherto known.18,19,21,24,28,29

Aldol adducts 4a–f and 5a,b, obtained by FSA D6H
catalysis showed high diastereomeric
purity (dr: 97:3, within the limits of high field NMR detection) (Table 1). The internal chiral
center from electrophiles 2b and the formation of 6-membered
ring hemiketals helped us to assign the absolute stereochemistry of
the one or two newly formed stereocenters, which resulted to be R-configured, in 4a,b and 5a,b, and R,R in 4e–f. Derivatives of lactol 5a are
extensively used as the chiral side chain for the synthesis of statin
drugs.37 The spectral data of 5a matched those obtained from the trimerization of acetaldehyde catalyzed
by DERAEcoli. Lactol 4a is
the 5-epimer of 5a and may constitute also an important
building block for stereochemical analogs of statins.38 Structural motives depicted in Scheme 1 are present in many natural products and
synthetic intermediates.8 Furthermore,
rare sugars are important for generating novel “glycol-randomized”
analogues of natural products,5,39−41 in the search for improved pharmaceutical lead compounds.42

Consistent with the stereochemical outcome
of adducts 4e–f, an E configured FSA K85-enamine
is imposed by the rigid ring of nucleophiles 1e and 1f (Figure 3).31 In contrast, a Z configured FSA K85-enamine nucleophile is always formed with the
acyclic hydroxymethylketone analogues (Figure 1A).17−19,28 In both cases, the nucleophilic attack takes place from the si-face, and the C=O of both S-
and R-2b was always attacked from its si-face. Thus, the anti-configured aldol
adducts were obtained with nucleophiles 1e and 1f, whereas the syn products were observed
with acyclic hydroxymethylketones. The anti-stereochemistry
from the addition of cyclopentanone to l-G3P catalyzed by
FSA D6H, could not be unequivocally ascertained in the previous work
because of the epimerization of the C-α to the carbonyl stereocenter
under the reaction conditions.31 In the
present case, the epimerization was plausibly precluded by the in
situ formation of the cyclic hemiketals: for 4e the cyclic:acyclic
ratio was 85:15, and for 4f, no acyclic species were
detected by NMR.

Figure 3 Molecular models of FSA-bound 1e-enamine/S-2b (A) and 1f-enamine/S-2b (B) intermediates.

Products 3b and 6b, synthesized using
catalysis by FSA D6H and D6Q, respectively, showed high enantiomeric
purity by chiral GC and HPLC analysis against racemic samples (Table 1). By analogy with 4b, it may safely be assumed that 3b has the R configuration, which correlates to products 4a and 5a,b. This is consistent with the
addition of hydroxymethylketone nucleophiles to 2a catalyzed
by wild-type FSA.17,28 Moreover, the optical rotation
of the unprotected product 9b, [α]D20= −30.3 (c = 0.5 in CHCl3) (lit.:43 for the R enantiomer
[α]D20 = +34.0 (c = 0.44,
CHCl3)) indicated that it was the S enantiomer.

The aldol addition of 1e to 2c gave a
mixture of two diastereoisomers 6e:7e. These
can arise from (i) the lack of a precise stereofacial C=O orientation
of 2c to the enzyme-enamine complex, yielding epimers
at C-β to the carbonyl,19,26 or (ii) the epimerization
of the C-α to the carbonyl group (i.e., the carbon tertiary
center and in this case no hemiketal can be formed) under the reaction
conditions (pH 8.0).31 Since deuterium
exchange at C-α to the carbonyl group was not detected by NMR,
it was concluded that products 6e and 7e were obtained via the first route.

Conclusions
We
herein present FSA D6X variants that catalyze aldol additions
of ethanal (1a) and simple ketones 1b, 1e, and 1f to nonphosphorylated hydroxyaldehydes
(2c,d). Substitution of D6 in wild-type
FSA by amino acids such as L, N, Q, E, or H is critical to generate
favorable interactions at the active site for nucleophile activation.
It is noteworthy that different residues in this position with dissimilar
electronic and steric properties, but not the native aspartate, rendered
enzymes that were able to catalyze the addition. Because the isosteric
neutral mutation D6N was active, aspartate appears to have a detrimental
electronic effect for the addition of nonfunctionalized aliphatic
ketones and ethanal to nonphosphorylated electrophilic substrates.
Propanone (1b) was accepted as nucleophile component
with all the selected electrophiles. Propanone is the closest analogue
of hydroxypropanone, the best reported hydroxymethylketone nucleophile
substrate for FSA.24,25,28 The FSA D6H variant was effective with most of the reactions, accepting
structurally different nucleophiles (e.g., 1a and 1f). Since none of the nucleophiles or electrophiles studied
here has equivalent hydroxyl groups to those present in hydroxyketones,
which can establish hydrogen-bond interactions with residue D6 (Figure 2), it could be speculated
that H in position 6 could have a role limiting the conformational
mobility of substrates because of its larger size. This could pose
a hindrance to the rotation of the C–N enamine bond and favor
an adequate orientation of the approaching acceptor carbonyl, thus
favoring the reaction of selected substrates.

We demonstrate
that direct biocatalytic bottom up construction
of rare deoxysugars and chiral intermediates is possible by the choice
of aldol components using FSA as catalyst with immediate control over
sites of deoxygenation. This work, along with previous studies on
FSA, has shown the unprecedented versatility of this aldolase with
just minimal changes in its active site. In this sense, FSA goes far
beyond any known aldolase in its breath of scope for asymmetric organic
synthesis, particularly when compared with dihydroxyacetone phosphate
(DHAP)-dependent aldolases and DERA for their narrow nucleophile selectivity.44−48 DERA is highly selective for ethanal but showed two-orders of magnitude
lower activity toward ketones such as propanone and fluoropropanone.48 Further experiments to widen the synthetic scope
of FSA for aldol reactions of simple aliphatic aldehydes and ketones
to amino aldehydes are in progress.
