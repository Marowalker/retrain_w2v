The
direct oxidative dehydrogenation of lactates with molecular
oxygen is a “greener” alternative for producing pyruvates.
Here we report a one-pot synthesis of mesoporous vanadia–titania
(VTN), acting as highly efficient and recyclable catalysts for the
conversion of ethyl lactate to ethyl pyruvate. These VTN materials
feature high surface areas, large pore volumes, and high densities
of isolated vanadium species, which can expose the active sites and
facilitate the mass transport. In comparison to homogeneous vanadium
complexes and VOx/TiO2 prepared
by impregnation, the meso-VTN catalysts showed superior activity,
selectivity, and stability in the aerobic oxidation of ethyl lactate
to ethyl pyruvate. We also studied the effect of various vanadium
precursors, which revealed that the vanadium-induced phase transition
of meso-VTN from anatase to rutile depends strongly on the vanadium
precursor. NH4VO3 was found to be the optimal
vanadium precursor, forming more monomeric vanadium species. V4+ as the major valence state was incorporated into the lattice
of the NH4VO3-derived VTN material, yielding
more V4+–O–Ti bonds in the anatase-dominant
structure. In situ DRIFT spectroscopy and density functional theory
calculations show that V4+–O–Ti bonds are
responsible for the dissociation of ethyl lactate over VTN catalysts
and for further activation of the deprotonation of β-hydrogen.
Molecular oxygen can replenish the surface oxygen to regenerate the
V4+–O–Ti bonds.

Introduction
Lignocellulosic biomass
is attracting increased attention as a
renewable carbon source for commodity chemicals.1 Unlike the case with fuel applications, the high oxygen
content and diversity of biomass-derived “platform molecules”
make them suitable feedstocks for high-added-value chemicals.2 Lactic acid (LA) and lactates are such platform
molecules. They can be converted to several commodity chemicals, including
acrylic acid, pyruvic acid, lactide, 1,2-propanediol, and acetaldehyde.3 The direct catalytic air oxidation of LA is a
promising route to pyruvic acid,4 a key
intermediate in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and food additive
sectors.5 Pyruvic acid occurs naturally
as an intermediate product in carbohydrate and protein metabolisms
in the body. Since it can be converted to carbohydrates, to fatty
acids or energy, or to the amino acid alanine, it is a key intermediate
in several metabolic processes. Pyruvic acid salts and esters (pyruvates)
are used as dietary supplements. For example, calcium pyruvate is
used as a fat burner in the food industry. Pyruvic acid is used as
a starting material for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, such as l-tryptophan and l-tyrosine, and for the synthesis
of amino acids such as alanine and phenyl alanine. Its derivatives
are also used to produce crop protection agents, cosmetic agents,
and flavoring ingredients. Pyruvic acid is also a reagent for regeneration
of carbonyl compounds from semicarbazones, phenylhydrazones, and oximes.
Currently, pyruvates are still made via the energy-intensive pyrolysis
of tartaric acid with stoichiometric KHSO4 as a dehydrating
agent. Ideally, this would be replaced by direct oxidative dehydrogenation
using molecular oxygen, giving water as the only byproduct. Even though
this reaction is thermodynamically feasible, its selectivity is low,
because LA is easily overoxidized.6

Several groups have studied this oxidation in the vapor and liquid
phases. In vapor-phase reactions, various catalysts including iron
phosphates and multicomponent mixed oxides were reported.7−9 However, such high-temperature routes are energy intensive and can
lead to the decomposition of pyruvates via decarbonylation or decarboxylation.10 The side reactions can be suppressed in liquid-phase
systems,11 but the milder conditions typically
require noble-metal catalysts for oxygen activation.12 Hayashi et al. reported Pd–metal alloy catalysts
on activated carbon for the synthesis of pyruvate in the presence
of NaOH.13 Ding and co-workers used bimetallic
Pb–Pt supported on carbon materials for the synthesis of pyruvic
acid in good yields, using an excess of LiOH to adjust the pH value.14 Despite these achievements, it is still essential
to develop a simple and cost-effective catalytic system for the oxidation
of lactates to pyruvates with oxygen under mild conditions.

Vanadium is an abundant element that is often used as a catalyst
in the selective oxidation of light alkanes and alcohols.15 Yasukawa et al. studied the oxidation of ethyl
lactate to pyruvate over various homogeneous vanadium compounds in
a gas–liquid microflow system.16 They found that vanadium oxytrichloride (VOCl3) gave
the highest yield (31%) at room temperature, making it 5 times as
active as V2O5.17 Considering catalyst recovery and product purification, solid vanadium
catalysts are preferable.18 Moreover, the
stability of unsupported vanadium compounds is an issue, as they are
easily hydrolyzed in the presence of H2O produced during
the reaction. Previously, we showed that titania is a suitable support
for catalyzing the lactate to pyruvate reaction.19 In principle, highly dispersed vanadyl species on anatase
TiO2 are desired for an efficient oxidation. However, the
density of isolated vanadyl species is limited by the titania surface
area, and distributing the sites evenly on the surface is problematic
at high loadings. In addition, these catalysts are also prone to leaching.20 On the basis of our earlier experience with
doped mixed oxides for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,21 we hypothesized that doping vanadium ions into
the mesoporous TiO2 lattice would solve these problems.
Titania–vanadia hybrids have been made using various methods,
including hydrothermal,22,23 sol–gel,24 electrochemical,25 spray pyrolysis,26 and coprecipitation.27 Gopinath et al. studied wormhole-like mesoporous
vanadium-doped titania in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene
to styrene, attributing the high activity to vanadium atoms in the
titania lattice.28 However, in most of
the cases, the vanadium sites embedded in the titania matrix were
unavailable for catalysis. Moreover, mesoporous TiO2 typically
has a low crystallinity, especially when soft template methods are
used, leading to low stability.29,30 Thus, we had to find
some way to expose the active sites and shorten mass/energy diffusion
pathways as well as improve the stability of the catalyst.

Here
we report a one-pot synthesis of mesoporous vanadia–titania
nanocrystals (meso-VTN) via the coassembly of vanadium and titanium
precursors in the presence of an amphiphilic triblock copolymer as
a templating agent. These new materials feature a large surface area
and a high density of isolated vanadium species. These meso-VTN catalysts
outperformed the homogeneous vanadium complexes and classical VOx-TiO2. We also studied the role
of various vanadium precursors in the formation of meso-VTN. Only
NH4VO3, which has the VO3– anion, provided a strong electrostatic interaction with the Ti4+ cations, yielding an anatase-dominant structure. Increasing
the vanadium loading also increases the number of active vanadium
dopant sites in the titania lattice, which in turn improves activity
and selectivity. We also ran in situ DRIFT spectroscopy studies and
DFT calculations, which revealed the relation between the structure
of the meso-VTN catalyst and its activity in the ethyl lactate oxidation.

Results
and Discussion
Catalyst Synthesis and Testing
First,
the coprecursors
ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and titanium
isopropoxide were dissolved in acidic ethanol solution, and then the
resultant mixture was assembled with F127 template via evaporation-induced
self-assembly. Subsequent calcination removed the template (Figure S1), yielding a highly crystalline meso-VTN
(denoted as NH4VO3@VTN). Three other meso-VTN
materials were prepared similarly, starting from different vanadium
precursors (VOSO4, VO(acac)2, and VCl3; see the experimental section in the
Supporting Information for details).

We then studied the catalytic
performance of these meso-VTN materials in the liquid-phase aerobic
oxidation of ethyl lactate to ethyl pyruvate (Table 1). In comparison to homogeneous vanadium
complexes, all of the meso-VTN samples showed good catalytic activity
and higher turnover frequencies (TOFs). Control reactions showed that
the vanadium precursors themselves were active as oxidation catalysts,
but not selective. In addition to the intrinsic disadvantages of homogeneous
catalysts in catalyst recovery and product purification, the homogeneous
vanadium compounds are unstable and are easily hydrolyzed by the water
byproduct.31,32 In contrast, our meso-VTN solid
can be reused at least 10 times without losing activity (see recycling
experiments below). The highest TOF of 118 h–1 was
measured for NH4VO3@VTN.

To understand
the high performance of NH4VO3@VTN, we characterized
the catalysts. The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the NH4VO3@VTN samples show
highly uniform and nearly spherical morphology in large domains (Figure 1a). The VTN nanoparticles
have a rough surface with an average size of ∼10 nm (see inset
in Figure 1a). This
size agrees well with the size obtained from the high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) studies (Figure 1b,c). HRTEM also confirmed the VTN uniformity.
A large number of white dots can be observed by TEM over the entire
nanostructure, indicating that the mesoporosity is well-dispersed
in the VTN framework (see Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information).33,34 The corresponding selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern confirmed a set of diffraction
rings (inset in Figure 1b), in accordance with the crystalline anatase phase (JCPDS No. 21-1272). Figure 1d also shows the
clear lattice fringes with an interplanar distance of 3.52 Å,
matching well with the (101) planes of the anatase structure.35 In addition, the high-angle annular dark-field
scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images and corresponding elemental mapping
further demonstrated the uniform distribution of Ti, V, and O atoms
in the NH4VO3@VTN sample (Figure 1e–1h and Figure S3).36,37

Then nitrogen adsorption–desorption experiments
for the
various meso-VTN samples were performed (Figure 2a). All of the materials showed a typical
type IV isotherm with an H1-type hysteresis loop, suggesting the presence
of mesopores.38Table 2 summarizes the textural parameters. The
BET area and pore volume of NH4VO3@VTN were
as high as 112 m2 g–1 and 0.33 cm3 g–1, respectively, comparable with those
of pristine TiO2. When other vanadium precursors are used,
the capillary condensation step becomes less steep and shifts to high
relative pressure, indicating a gradual increase in pore size.39 This trend agrees well with the results of pore
size distribution (Figure 2b), where NH4VO3@VTN showed a sharp
peak indicating uniform pore size, while the peaks of VOSO4@VTN, VCl3@VTN, and VO(acac)2@VTN became broad.
This difference indicates the key role of vanadium precursors in the
formation of meso-VTN. The increase in pore size can be attributed
to the different strengths of electrostatic interaction between Ti
and V precursors during the self-assembly process.40,41

X-ray diffraction
(XRD) can verify the influence of V doping on
the crystalline structure of meso-VTN. As shown in Figure 3a, no vanadia peaks were detected,
suggesting a uniform distribution of vanadium in the VTN crystals,
in agreement with the elemental mapping shown in Figure 1. Notably, the (101) diffraction
peak shifts slightly toward a higher angle after the introduction
of vanadium species (Figure 3b). This implies that the vanadium ions are incorporated in
the titania lattice.42 For NH4VO3@VTN, the XRD pattern showed the characteristic anatase
titania peaks, with a trace amount of rutile. However, with other
vanadium compounds as precursors, the intensity of the rutile diffraction
peaks increased while the anatase fraction decreased. Notably, VCl3@VTN showed a rutile-dominant diffraction pattern. The anatase:rutile
ratios, calculated on the basis of the integrated intensities of the
anatase (101) peak and rutile (110) peak,43 are shown in Table 2. The anatase content in meso-VTN decreases as follows: NH4VO3 > VOSO4 > VO(acac)2 >
VCl3. This confirms that the vanadium-induced phase transition
of meso-VTN from anatase to rutile depends strongly on the vanadium
precursor. Figure 3c shows the Raman spectra of all V-doped VTN samples. The Raman characterization
also upholds the XRD results. All of the samples showed a set of bands
at 146 (Eg), 198 (Eg), 396 (B1g),
516 (A1g + B1g) and 638 (Eg) cm–1, which are assigned to the fundamental active modes
of anatase TiO2.28,44 No typical Raman peaks
of VOx species were detected, indicating
the absence of crystalline vanadium oxides, also supporting the complete
doping of vanadium into the anatase lattice.45 In addition, all of the peaks of VTN samples became asymmetric in
comparison to pure TiO2 (Figure 3d). This holds especially for VO(acac)2 and VCl3@VTN, where two weak bands at 445 and
610 cm–1 were observed, which can be assigned to
the rutile TiO2 features.43 Among
those vanadium precursors, only NH4VO3 has the
VO3– anion, which could provide a strong
electrostatic interaction with the Ti4+ cations, showing
a more anatase dominant structure. Note that both anatase and rutile
titania are made up of TiO6 octahedra in tetragonal configurations.46 The structural difference between them is caused
by the stacking arrangement of these TiO6 units. The metastable
anatase structure consists of edge-sharing TiO6 octahedra
in zigzag stacking, while the stable rutile consists of both corner
and edge-sharing TiO6 in the linear stacking.47,48 Titanium oligomers can interact with vanadium precursors via electrostatic
interaction during the self-assembly process.49 The substitution of the lattice Ti by V ions distorts the anatase
structure, thus promoting the transformation from anatase to rutile.

diffraction patterns (a, b) and Raman spectra (c, d) of blank-TiO2 and VTN materials prepared from different vanadium precursors.
Due to the low loadings, VOx species were
not observed.

Temperature-programmed
reduction studies showed that NH4VO3 forms monomeric
VO4 units (Figure 4). After vanadium was introduced
into the titania lattice, the maximum hydrogen consumption (Tmax) shifted to lower temperature, in comparison
with pure TiO2 and V2O5. Generally,
the nature of the VOx species affects
the reducibility of V-doped TiO2. Monomeric VO4 species are more easily reduced.50 Among
the VTN samples, NH4VO3@VTN showed the lowest Tmax value, suggesting that NH4VO3@VTN forms more monomeric vanadium species. This may reflect
the strong electrostatic interaction between VO3– and the Ti4+ precursors. We conclude that NH4VO3 is the best precursor, as it provides a strong electrostatic
interaction with the Ti4+ cations, thereby suppressing
the agglomeration of vanadium species (Scheme 1).

precursors.

Factors Governing Activity and Selectivity
We examined
the effect of reaction conditions on the aerobic oxidation of ethyl
lactate with dioxygen over the NH4VO3@VTN catalyst.
As shown in Figure 5, the selectivity of ethyl pyruvate was high at lower temperatures
and decreased gradually with increasing temperature. Ethyl lactate
conversion increased with the reaction temperature, with the highest
yield to ethyl pyruvate obtained at 130 °C. Increasing the temperature
further decreased the yield of ethyl pyruvate. We also plotted the
selectivity of major products against ethyl lactate conversion and
reaction time over 0.6%V-NH4VO3@VTN at optimized
temperature. As shown in Figure 6a, the ethyl lactate conversion increased with the
reaction time, reaching 70% after 8 h, with ethyl pyruvate as the
main product together with ethanol, pyruvic acid, and some minor byproducts.
The ethyl pyruvate selectivity gradually decreased from 91% to 58%
with the reaction time on stream, as the amounts of both ethanol and
pyruvic acid increased to 28% and 11%, respectively. Several minor
byproducts including acetic acid and acetaldehyde were detected at
a steady state with a selectivity of ∼2%. On the basis of these
results, we propose a reaction network for the aerobic oxidation of
ethyl lactate, involving oxidative dehydrogenation, hydrolysis, and
decarboxylation steps (Figure 6b).

Figure 5 Effect of reaction temperature on the aerobic oxidation of ethyl
lactate. Reaction conditions: 0.6%V-NH4VO3@VTN
50 mg, 1 atm O2, 2 h, ethyl lactate 8.5 mmol (1.0 g), diethyl

(b) Proposed reaction pathway for the aerobic oxidation of ethyl lactate.

We also studied the effect of
vanadium loading on the catalytic
activity by modifying the NH4VO3 precursor concentration
for a series of NH4VO3@VTN materials. These
catalysts are denoted as xV-NH4VO3@VTN, where x represents the weight ratio
(wt %) of vanadium. The corresponding porosity analysis and textural
parameters are given in Figure S4 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Figure 7a shows the selectivity–conversion
curves of these NH4VO3@VTN catalysts. Pure meso-TiO2 (0% V) showed some conversion, but selectivity to pyruvate
was low. We think that the basic OH groups on the TiO2 surface
can hydrolyze lactate and pyruvate to ethanol and lactic/pyruvic acid.
When vanadium was introduced in TiO2, the resulting VTN
catalysts showed high ethyl pyruvate selectivity, reaching 95% at
low ethyl lactate conversion. At higher ethyl lactate conversions,
the selectivity of ethyl pyruvate tended to increase with an increase
in the V loading (from 0.2% to 2%V).9 This
indicates that vanadium acts as the active site in lactate-to-pyruvate
reaction, and at higher vanadium loadings, the competing hydrolysis
is suppressed. To check this, we ran control experiments on the aerobic
oxidation of ethyl lactate over 0.2 V%-NH4VO3@VTN, using molecular sieves 3 Å (MS-3A) as a dehydrating agent
(Figure S5). Addition of MS-3A gave a much
higher selectivity of 80% to ethyl pyruvate (at 51.6% conversion),
in comparison to 56% (at 50.2% conversion) in the absence of MS-3A
(Figure S5a). Without the dehydrating agent,
the amount of byproducts was higher: e.g., a selectivity to ethanol
of 22% instead of 10% (Figure S5b). When
the V loading was increased to 3%, the difference between 2% and 3%
almost leveled up. To better understand this trend, we plotted the
ethyl pyruvate yield against reaction time (Figure 7b), which confirmed that 2%V-NH4VO3@VTN gives the highest yield. Indeed, the crystalline
V2O5 can be seen in the XRD of the 3%V NH4VO3@VTN sample, suggesting that some of the vanadium
is aggregated as V2O5 (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). Thus, increasing
the vanadium loading also increases the number of active vanadium
dopant sites in the titania lattice, which in turn results in improved
overall activity and selectivity.

Figure 7 Selectivity to ethyl pyruvate plotted
against conversion (a) of
NH4VO3@VTN on varying the vanadium loading from
0 to 3 wt % and (b) the corresponding time-resolved yield profile
of ethyl pyruvate. Reaction conditions: catalyst 50 mg, 1 atm O2, 130 °C, ethyl lactate 8.5 mmol (1.0 g), diethyl succinate
(solvent) 2 mL.

Further insight into
the reaction can be gained by analyzing structure–activity
relationships. Interestingly, we found that the TOF of NH4VO3@VTN was inversely proportional to the vanadium loading
(Figure 8a), showing
a close correlation with the ratio V4+/ (V4+ + V5+) (derived from the V 2p spectrum in Table 3). In particular, the amounts
of exposed V4+ ions are correlated with catalytic performance.
The similar ionic radii of Ti4+ (0.61 Å) and V4+ (0.58 Å) enable the doping of the latter into the titania
lattice (V5+ is much smaller, 0.54 Å).45 To understand this behavior at the atomic level,
we built a simple model of anatase titania (Figure 8b) and performed density functional theory
(DFT) calculations of the substitution of V4+ and V5+ for Ti4+ in the anatase lattice (a more detailed
description of the simulations is provided in the Supporting Information). We found that exchanging the surface
Ti with V4+ on anatase TiO2 corresponds to a
lower energy in comparison to that of V5+, in line with
previous reports.51

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements show that the
Ti 2p peaks of NH4VO3@VTN containing 0.6% V
and 1% V are asymmetric, in comparison with pure TiO2 (Figure 9A, a–c). This
indicates the presence of two types of Ti on the surface. The binding
energy corresponding to Ti4+ (Ti 2p1/2, 464.8
eV; Ti 2p3/2, 459.1 eV) is shifted toward higher values.
These results imply that Ti is replaced with V, decreasing the electron
charge density of Ti4+.52 This
means that the neighboring lattice Ti (denoted as Ti(V)) of the vanadium dopant gives a high binding energy. For comparison,
we prepared 0.6% VOx/TiO2 using
impregnation, where the Ti(V) peak was not detected in
XPS spectra (Figure S7). This further confirmed
the substitution of lattice Ti by vanadium. As the vanadium loading
increases, the deconvoluted peaks corresponding to Ti(V) gradually disappear (Figure 9A, d and e). When more vanadium is incorporated in the TiO2 lattice, isolated V4+ will be gradually converted
to polymerized VOx, thus lowering the
fraction of Ti(V).53 This agrees
also with the decrease in the ratio V4+/(V4+ + V5+) (Figure 9B and Table 3). When the V loading is increased to 3%, the peaks of crystalline
V2O5 can be seen in the XRD pattern (Figure S6). As shown in Figure 9C, the spectra of O 1s in NH4VO3@VTN can be deconvoluted into three peaks: the peak at 530.3
eV was ascribed to the O2– lattice oxygen (OI), and the peaks at ∼531.6 and ∼532.3 eV are
ascribed to O22– and O– surface chemisorbed oxygen (labeled as OII and OIII).54 The OII oxygens,
which are located at the surface defects, are more active and therefore
more easily reduced.55,56 As vanadium ions with different
valences replace Ti4+ ions in the lattice, the charge imbalance
generates structural defects and additional oxygen vacancies.57,58 This increases the number of mobile OII species.59 In our case, the V4+/ (V4++V5+) ratio decreased from 0.54 to 0.28 when V loading
is increased, and the OII/(OI + OII + OIII) fraction decreased simultaneously.

in heterogeneous catalysis. To rule out the possibility of vanadium
leaching, we ran a hot filtration experiment (Figure S8).60 When the NH4VO3@VTN catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture
after 3 h, no further ethyl lactate conversion was observed. Moreover,
the vanadium content of the filtrate was below the detection limit
of ICP-AES analysis. For comparison, we prepared vanadia supported
on titania with an identical surface vanadium content using impregnation
(herein VOx/TiO2; the vanadium
content on the surface was determined by XPS). Mesoporous anatase
TiO2 was impregnated with aqueous solutions of NH4VO3 and oxalic acid, followed by drying and calcining
for 4 h at 500 °C. Control experiments showed that the filtrate
of VOx/TiO2 was still active
in ethyl lactate oxidation (Figure S9),
indicating that V species do leach into solution in the case of impregnation.
We also determined the recyclability of NH4VO3@VTN. In each run, the catalyst was separated by simple centrifugation
and then dispersed in water under ultrasonication for 1 h. As shown
in Figure 10, the
NH4VO3@VTN could be reused 10 times without
significant loss of activity. The XRD and TEM analysis confirmed that
the meso structure and anatase/rutile ratio were well preserved after
recycling (Figure S10).

lactate to ethyl pyruvate. Reaction
conditions: 100 mg catalyst, 130 °C, 1 atm O2, 4 h,
ethyl lactate 8.5 mmol (1 g), diethyl succinate (solvent) 2 mL.

Mechanistic Considerations
To study the reaction mechanism
of lactate to pyruvate on the NH3VO4@VTN surface,
we did in situ DRIFTS studies. Figure 11 shows the results for the aerobic oxidation
of ethyl lactate over 0.2%V-NH3VO4@VTN at 130
°C at different reaction times. Typical vibrational bands of
ethyl lactate on NH3VO4@VTN were observed after
ethyl lactate adsorption. The positive bands at 2987, 2943, and 2885
cm–1 were ascribed to νas(CH3), νas(CH2), and νs(CH3), respectively.61,62 The corresponding
C–H bending vibrations were also detected (δ(CH2) 1473 cm–1, δ(CH3) 1454 cm–1, and δ(CH3) 1324 cm–1).61,63 The lactate carboxyl stretching vibrations
were observed at 1562 cm–1 (νs(COO))
and 1425 cm–1 (νas(COO)), while
the peak at 1740 cm–1 belongs to the lactate carbonyl
ν(C=O).61 Two additional peaks
appeared at 1678 and 1658 cm–1, probably due to
the C=O bonds coordinated with the VTN surface.64 After 20 min, we observed two new shoulder peaks
at 1867 and 1780 cm–1, which are related to the
carbonyl stretching of the α-keto group of the pyruvate.65 The intensity of pyruvate bands increased with
the reaction time on stream; meanwhile, νs(COO) at
1562 cm–1 gradually shifted to 1590 cm–1, suggesting the formation of more ethyl pyruvate. Moreover, two
weak bands at 1130 and 1217 cm–1 can be ascribed
to the hydroxyl-related C–O vibrations of ethyl lactate (νlactate(C–O) and δlactate(C–O)),
reflecting the OH deprotonation of ethyl lactate on VTN surface. The
signals of νlactate(C–O) and δlactate(C–O) reached a maximum in the first 20 min, indicating that
the lactate OH deprotonation plays a key role in this reaction. This
is also confirmed by the new broad band at ∼3250 cm–1, which indicates the formation of adsorbed water on VTN surface.65 Note that the V=O overtone band (∼2040
cm–1)63 is well-preserved
during the aerobic oxidation of ethyl lactate, while the V–O
related bond (δ(V4+–O–Ti) ∼1370
cm–1)66 is diminished
in intensity. This indicates that the terminal V=O bonds are
not involved in the ethyl lactate conversion, confirming the vital
role of V4+–O related bonds.

Figure 11 In situ DRIFT spectra
recorded during aerobic oxidation of ethyl
lactate with air over 0.2%-NH3VO4@VTN catalyst
at different time intervals (0, 20, 40, ..., 360 min) at 130 °C.

To complement the experimental
results and the reaction pathways
for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethyl lactate to ethyl pyruvate,
we built a periodic model of VTN by replacing lattice Ti with V4+ in the top layer of the (101) facet of anatase titania.
This model was simulated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations
as implemented in the CP2K package (see the Supporting Information for details). First, we studied the adsorption
and dissociation of ethyl lactate (EL) on the VTN surface. Several
possible adsorbed forms were considered (see Figure S11). Geometry optimization showed that EL can be stabilized
on either surface titanium or vanadium atoms (Figure 12). The hydroxyl oxygen coordinates to surface
titanium atoms with a Ti···OH–R distance of
2.085 Å, in comparison with a V···OH–R
distance of 2.126 Å. In both cases, the O–H bonds were
elongated, from 0.974 Å to 1.039 and 1.025 Å, respectively.
The adsorption energy of EL on Ti was higher than that of EL on V
by 0.73 kcal/mol, in agreement with previous reports.19

Figure 12 Optimized geometries of two different models for ethyl
lactate
chemisorption on the VTN (101) surface: (a) Ti-type adsorption geometry,
where ethyl lactate interacts with the Ti atom; (b) V-type adsorption
geometry, where ethyl lactate interacts with the V atom. Atom colors:
Ti, blue; O, red; V, yellow.

Then, activation of the hydroxyl group triggers the dissociation
of EL via proton transfer to a nearby bridging oxygen atom (Obr). To simplify this process, we focused on two types of bridges:
V4+–O–Ti (Obr-V) and Ti–O–Ti
(Obr-Ti). Figure 13 shows the geometries of two possible intermediates,
(a) and (b), in this step. In both cases, the protonated EL is bonded
to a titanium atom. Yet while in (a) the hydroxyl H transfers to a
nearby V4+–O–Ti site, forming a H–Obr-V bond, in (b) the proton transfers to a Ti–O–Ti
to form a H–Obr-Ti bond. The intermediate
energies for the formation of (a) and (b) are −75.6 and −136
kcal/mol, respectively. This suggests that the V4+–O–Ti
bonds are responsible for the dissociation of ethyl lactate over VTN
catalysts, supporting the experimental result. In addition, the β-hydrogen
of the protonated EL can interact with the V4+–O–Ti
oxygen, increasing the C–Hβ bond length from
1.099 to 1.118 Å.

Figure 13 Representative structures of the two intermediates
during proton
transfer process: (a) hydrogen atom transfer to bridging oxygen atoms
in V–O–Ti sites; (b) hydrogen atom transfer to bridging
oxygen atoms in Ti–O–Ti sites.

Therefore, the simulations show us that (i) ethyl lactate
adsorbs
preferentially on the VTN surface via the coordination of hydroxyl
oxygen to titanium, (ii) V4+–O–Ti bonds play
a vital role in the dissociation of ethyl lactate, and (iii) the deprotonation
of β-hydrogen is also activated by V4+–O–Ti
bonds.

For most oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the molecular
oxygen
activation involves either free radical or Mars–van Krevelen
pathways.67 To determine if any radical
species is involved in this reaction, we introduced a number of free
radical scavengers to the reaction mixture (BHT, p-benzoquinone, and tert-butyl alcohol; see Table S2). These free radical scavengers did
not suppress the reaction completely, ruling out the formation of
free radical intermediates (i.e., superoxide radical O2•–) in the bulk reaction mixture. To further
study the role of molecular oxygen, we ran control experiments over
NH4VO3@VTN, where the molecular oxygen was replaced
by nitrogen. The reaction was limited without oxygen.55,56 Thus, we can conclude that the aerobic oxidation follows a Mars–van
Krevelen mechanism for VTN catalysts, wherein molecular oxygen can
replenish the V4+–O–Ti bonds. A trace amount
of ethyl lactate was converted to ethyl pyruvate in nitrogen initially,
probably due to the oxygen still chemisorbed on the surface of VTN.
This anaerobic process of lactate to pyruvate was also observed by
in situ DRIFTS experiments at elevated temperatures under a helium
atmosphere. The signals for the V4+–O–Ti
bonds gradually decreased and shifted to higher wavelengths, accompanied
by the formation of the characteristic peaks of pyruvate (Figure S12).

On the basis of the experimental
and computational results, we
can propose a probable mechanism (Scheme 2). Starting with the pristine catalyst VTN,
ethyl lactate adsorbs and then chemisorbs by the coordinated bond
to titanium atoms a and further forms the transition
state b. Then, the hydroxyl H atom transfers to near
V4+–O–Ti sites, forming the Ti4+–O–substrate intermediate and a V4+–O–H
bond (c). This is followed by β-hydrogen activation
through an interaction with an adjacent V4+–O–Ti
oxygen, giving the five-membered intermediate d. Ethyl
pyruvate is then produced by β-hydrogen elimination, giving
water as a byproduct as well as creating an oxygen vacancy (e, f). Finally, adsorbed oxygen replenishes the
oxygen vacancy, regenerating the V4+–O–Ti
bonds. In general, structural defects containing lower oxidation state
cations are reported to be necessary to activate the oxygen. Here,
we anticipate that V4+, because of its lower oxidation
state, can activate oxygen better than V5+. This could
be also connected with the fact that a linear relationship is observed
between TOF and the amount of V4+ in the samples.

Scheme 2 Proposed
Catalytic Cycle for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethyl
Lactate to Ethyl Pyruvate in the Presence of Meso-VTN
Conclusions
We developed a one-pot
strategy for the controllable synthesis
of uniform mesoporous vanadia–titania nanoparticles (VTNs).
NH4VO3 is the optimal vanadium precursor, forming
primarily monomeric VO4 units, avoiding the agglomeration
of polymeric vanadium species as well as the formation of a rutile
structure to a great extent. In comparison to homogeneous vanadium
compounds and the classical VOx-TiO2 prepared by impregnation, the meso-VTN catalysts showed superior
catalytic activity and selectivity for the ODH of ethyl lactate to
ethyl pyruvate. In addition, V4+ as the major valence state
was incorporated into the anatase TiO2, which can increase
the availability of surface chemisorbed oxygen, resulting in high
catalytic activity for aerobic oxidation of ethyl lactate. Hot filtration
and recyclability tests confirmed that NH4VO3@VTN does not leach into solution and can be reused at least 10 times
without loss of activity. In situ DRIFTS and DFT simulations show
that ethyl lactate adsorbs preferentially on the VTN surface via the
coordination of hydroxyl oxygen to titanium. The V4+–O–Ti
bonds play a key role in the dissociation of ethyl lactate and further
promote the deprotonation of β-hydrogen. In addition, molecular
oxygen can replenish the surface oxygen to regenerate the V4+–O–Ti bonds. Thus, this work provides fundamental insights
for developing further simple and cost-effective catalytic systems
for highly efficient conversion of biomass derivatives to value-added
chemicals under mild conditions.
