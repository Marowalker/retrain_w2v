We
have developed a highly regioselective homogeneous gold(I)-catalyzed anti-hydrochlorination of unactivated alkynes at room temperature.
We have overcome the incompatibility between conventional cationic
gold catalysts and chloride by using a hydrogen-bonding activation
of the Au–Cl bond. This approach is scalable, exhibits excellent
functional group tolerance, and can be conducted in open air.

==== Body
Chlorination is one of the most
important transformations in organic synthesis because of the biological
activities and synthetic value of the chlorinated products.1 More specifically, vinyl chloride is one of the
most important group of chlorine-containing compounds. Vinyl chlorides
are widely found in natural products, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals,1,2 and also are valuable coupling partners in coupling reactions such
as Buchwald–Hartwig amination3 and
Suzuki–Miyaura coupling.4 Compared
to the traditional syntheses of vinyl chlorides, such as halogenations
of carbonyl compounds5 and electrophilic
chlorination of alkynes,6 the direct hydrochlorination
of alkynes from HCl is a straightforward and atom-economic method.
However, given that HCl itself is a dangerous gas and handling is
problematic, synthetic chemists have focused on indirect hydrochlorination
strategies for activated alkynes,7 using
RCOCl, TMSCl, or metal chlorides as chlorine sources (Scheme 1a).8 One notable example is the recent work by Engle and co-workers on
the palladium-catalyzed anti-hydrochlorination of
alkynes using a directing group (Scheme 1b).9 The direct
hydrochlorination of unactivated alkynes using HCl has been rarely
reported. Dai and co-workers found that gaseous HCl could hydrochlorinate
electron-rich phenylacetylenes but the use of gaseous HCl and hydration
side products present major drawbacks.10 Derien and co-workers developed a ruthenium-catalyzed hydrochlorination
of alkynes that gave good yields (Scheme 1c).11 Although
this method works well for terminal alkynes, higher temperature was
needed and low stereoselectivity was observed for internal alkynes
(Scheme 1c). Moreover,
a restrictive Schlenk environment was essential. The heterogeneous
gold-catalyzed hydrochlorination of acetylene for manufacture of vinyl
chloride monomer (VCM) is a well-studied process12 and has been industrialized recently (Scheme 1d).13 Recently, and independently, the Corma group14 and our group15 reported a heterogeneous
gold (TiO2/Au)-catalyzed hydrochlorination reaction of
alkynes. Although good syn-addition selectivity was
observed, high temperatures were needed (Scheme 1d).

Scheme 1 Major Synthetic Methods for Chlorination
of Alkynes to Synthesize
Vinylchlorides
Although homogeneous
cationic gold catalysts are considered as
the most powerful catalysts for the electrophilic activation of alkynes,16 the cationic gold-catalyzed hydrochlorination
of alkynes has not been reported because of the high affinity between
cationic gold and chloride.17 Indeed, commonly
used gold precatalysts, such as PPh3AuCl, usually need
silver salts to break the strong Au–Cl bond and release an
active cationic gold species and chloride is known to easily poison
cationic gold species (Scheme 2a).18 We are now pleased to report
a homogeneous gold-catalyzed alkyne hydrochlorination with exclusive anti-selectivity that overcomes the incompatibility between
cationic gold catalysts and chloride (Scheme 1e).

Scheme 2 Conventional Cationic Gold Catalysis
and Chloride-Tolerant Homogenous
Gold Catalysis
We proposed that a
combination of strong hydrogen bond donor solvents
such as hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) and HCl would generate a strong
hydrogen-bonding donor network A, and that the hydrogen
bonding between chlorine in L–Au-Cl and A might
weaken the Au–Cl bond (Scheme 2b). This would generate a partially cationic gold species B via hydrogen-bonding interaction. This strategy would avoid
the use of a silver salt to activate the gold precatalyst, a step
that is known to exert negative effects in gold catalysis.19

We used 4-phenylbutyne 1a as the model substrate for
reaction optimization. We screened various ligands, HCl sources, and
solvents (Table 1).

a Yields
were determined by GC-MS
using dodecane as internal standard.

b Reaction run at rt for 24 h.

c Ketone product formed (accounts
for the remaining ratio of product).

d Solvent mixture is 1:1 by volume.

Due to its high hydrogen bond basicity
but low Brønsted basicity,20,21 DMPU is able to form
a stable and highly concentrated complex with
hydrogen chloride (HCl).15 Using 1.5 equiv
of HCl/DMPU and 2 mol % of gold catalyst and various ligands (L1–L6) led to high yields of product (Table 1, entries 1–6).
However, the anti-Markovnikov and dichlorinated products
were also obtained in varying amounts. The use of L5 improved
the selectivity of the produced vinyl chloride to 95% yield, needing
only 1.2 equiv of HCl/DMPU (Table 1, entry 7). Formation of the dichlorinated byproduct
was avoided by running the reaction at ambient temperature (Table 1, entry 8–9),
with both L5 and L6 working equally well.
A poor yield was obtained in the absence of gold (Table 1, entry 10). Notably, lower
selectivity and poor yields were observed when commercially available
HCl sources (HCl/iPrOH and HCl/ether) were used (Table 1, entries 11 and 12).
We screened other solvents to further optimize the regioselectivity.
We found that a 1:1 HFIP: CH3NO2 mixture provided
optimal conditions. It is worth noting that tert-butanol
and THF gave substantial amounts to the corresponding ketone. A 1:1
HFIP: DMF combination worked well also (Table 1, entry 16).

With optimized conditions
in hand, we investigated the substrate
scope (Table 2). We
first examined the scope of aliphatic alkynes. A wide variety of terminal
alkynes reacted smoothly to give the corresponding vinyl chlorides
in good to excellent yields.

Table 2 Substrate Scope of
Homogeneous Gold-Catalyzed
Hydrochlorination of Alkynesa
a Reaction conditions: alkyne 1 (0.5
mmol), HCl/DMPU (1.2 equiv), L6AuCl (2
mol %), HFIP:CH3NO2 (0.125 mL) at rt for 16–36
h. Isolated yields.

b 75 °C
was used.

Nitrile (2b), ester (2d), imide (2e), sulfide
(2f), amide (2u), and
ketone ether (2v) functional groups were well-tolerated
under the standard conditions. The reaction with derivatized amino
acid (2u) and the natural product estrone (2v) led to the corresponding products in 69% and 95% yield, respectively.
The internal alkyne 4-octyne (2c) also worked well, although
higher temperature and longer reaction time were needed. When we explored
the scope of arylacetylenes, we found good to excellent yields using
electron-rich and electron-deficient arylacetylenes. Para (1h), meta (1i), and ortho (1j) tolylacetylenes furnished the corresponding
vinyl chlorides in excellent yields. It is worth noting that electron-deficient
arylacetylenes gave increasing amounts of the anti-Markovnikov products
(2n, 2o, 2p, and 2q). A remarkable example was the heteroaromatic alkyne 2-ethynylpyridine
(1r), which was expected to quench the reactivity of
homogeneous cationic gold due to its basic nature, but under our conditions, 1r furnished the anti-Markovnikov vinyl chloride (2r) in 70% yield.

The change of regioselectivity in 2r could have been
caused by the pyridinyl nitrogen acting as a directing group and coordinating
with HCl or gold. 3-Ethynylthiophene (1s) gave an excellent
yield of the corresponding chloro product. The electron-deficient
internal alkyne ethylphenylpropiolate (1t) also worked
well, albeit a higher temperature (75 °C) was needed, and the
yield was modest (66%). In this case, a mixture of E/Z isomers was
obtained, possibly due to the isomerization caused by the elevated
temperature.

It should be noted that our homogeneous gold catalyzed
reaction
required milder conditions (room temperature) than the recently reported
heterogeneous gold catalyzed process, and that the stereochemistry
of the addition was different.14 Due to
the milder conditions of our reaction, we expected better functional
group tolerance. Indeed, the peptide (2u) and derivatized
estrone (2v) were tolerated under our conditions. The
homogeneous gold process gave the anti-addition pattern
(Table 2, 2c and 2r), which is consistent with typical homogeneous
gold catalysis where cationic gold activates alkyne substrates. On
the other hand, the nanogold catalyzed process gave syn-addition products, which suggests that nanogold initially activates
HCl rather than the alkyne.14

Our
strategy for the hydrochlorination of unactivated alkynes was
easily expanded to large-scale synthesis, without affecting yield
and regioselectivity (Scheme 3a). To examine the synthetic value of the synthesized vinyl
chlorides, we conducted two classic reactions that use vinyl chlorides
as building blocks, namely the Suzuki coupling and the Buchwald–Hartwig
amination. In both cases, the desired products were isolated in good
yields (Scheme 3b,c).

Scheme 3 Gram-Scale Synthesis and the Synthetic Utility of Vinylchlorides
In conclusion, we have reported
the first efficient regioselective
homogeneous gold-catalyzed hydrochlorination of unactivated alkynes.
We have overcome the traditional incompatibility between conventional
cationic gold catalysts and chloride. This method can be easily scaled
up, and the reactions can be conducted in the open air.
