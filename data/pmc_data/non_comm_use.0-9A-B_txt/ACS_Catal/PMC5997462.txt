One
of the well-known observations in the Fischer–Tropsch
(FT) reaction is that the CH4 selectivity for cobalt catalysts
is always higher than the value expected on the basis of the Anderson–Schulz–Flory
(ASF) distribution. Depositing graphitic carbon on a cobalt catalyst
strongly suppresses this non-ASF CH4, while the formation
of higher hydrocarbons is much less affected. Carbon was laid down
on the cobalt catalyst via the Boudouard reaction. We provide evidence
that the amorphous carbon does not influence the FT reaction, as it
can be easily hydrogenated under reaction conditions. Graphitic carbon
is rapidly formed and cannot be removed. This unreactive form of carbon
is located on terrace sites and mainly decreases the CO conversion
by limiting CH4 formation. Despite nearly unchanged higher
hydrocarbon yield, the presence of graphitic carbon enhances the chain-growth
probability and strongly suppresses olefin hydrogenation. We demonstrate
that graphitic carbon will slowly deposit on the cobalt catalysts
during CO hydrogenation, thereby influencing CO conversion and the
FT product distribution in a way similar to that for predeposited
graphitic carbon. We also demonstrate that the buildup of graphitic
carbon by 13CO increases the rate of C–C coupling
during the 12C3H6 hydrogenation reaction,
whose products follow an ASF-type product distribution of the FT reaction.
We explain these results by a two-site model on the basis of insights
into structure sensitivity of the underlying reaction steps in the
FT mechanism: carbon formed on step-edge sites is involved in chain
growth or can migrate to terrace sites, where it is rapidly hydrogenated
to CH4. The primary olefinic FT products are predominantly
hydrogenated on terrace sites. Covering the terraces by graphitic
carbon increases the residence time of CHx intermediates, in line with decreased CH4 selectivity
and increased chain-growth rate.

1 Introduction
Since
Fischer–Tropsch (FT) synthesis was discovered in 1925,1,2 this fascinating reaction has attracted tremendous interest from
chemists and chemical engineers.3,4 Today, it has been commercialized
for the conversion of cheap coal and natural gas feedstock to a variety
of products, including clean transportation fuels and chemicals.5−7 Given the abundance and low price of natural gas in certain areas,
CH4 is preferred over coal for the production of synthesis
gas. In addition, synthesis gas production, which accounts for 60–70%
of the capital and running costs of a typical FT plant,7 is cheaper with CH4 as the feedstock.
A central issue in commercial FT technology is to minimize the production
of CH4, which has the lowest value among the hydrocarbon
products.

The main products of cobalt-catalyzed FT synthesis
are linear olefins
and paraffins.8 A typical hydrocarbon distribution
is strongly reminiscent of the Anderson–Schulz–Flory
(ASF) distribution, which is typically found for the products of oligomerization
or polymerization processes.9,10 The CH4 selectivity
on cobalt is always higher than the ideal ASF distribution on the
basis of higher hydrocarbons predictions. This observation has been
attributed to thermodynamically favored formation of CH4, since the bond strength of C–H in CH4 (435 kJ
mol–1) is higher than that of the C–C bond
(376 kJ mol–1 in ethane).8 This deviation in CH4 selectivity has also been explained
by facile hydrogenation of the surface CHx to CH4 in comparison to hydrogenation of surface intermediates
to higher hydrocarbons.11 However, recent
simulations using a reversible chain-growth model show that increasing
the rate constant of CHx hydrogenation
does not lead to a lower propagation rate for CHx but rather to a lower chain-length-independent chain-growth
probability.12 In addition to the metallic
phase in the catalyst, the support material influences the methane
formation as well. Prieto et al. reported that the methane selectivity
is at a maximum as a function of the acid–basic character of
the support, and that a highly basic dopant such as SmOx can suppress methane formation.13

A thorough understanding of the formation of CH4 in
the FT process is fundamentally important to improve the performance
of cobalt catalysts. Modern computational approaches combined with
the development of accurate nanoparticle model systems enable an in
depth study of this issue, in which a knowledge of structure sensitivity
plays a key role.14,15 It is widely documented that
the dissociation of diatomic molecules with π bonds such as
CO,16,17 NO,18,19 and N220 preferably takes place on step-edge sites. Whereas
this is well accepted for N2 dissociation in the context
of ammonia synthesis,21 there is less agreement
on the mode of CO dissociation under FT conditions.22,23 Direct CO dissociation is preferred on step edges over terraces.22 The main alternative idea is that CO can be
dissociated in an H-assisted manner: i.e., involving HCO24,25 or HCOH26,27 as intermediates. Chain growth has also
been compared on step edges and terrace sites. Cheng et al. reported
that the lowest energy barrier of CHx–CHy bond formation involves CH2 +
CH2 reactions, which are strongly favored on a stepped
cobalt surface in comparison to a flat surface.28 In contrast, CHx hydrogenation,
in which a σ-bond is formed, is usually regarded as a structure-insensitive
reaction.14,15 As CHx binds
more weakly on a terrace in comparison to a stepped surface, one expects
slightly fast CHx hydrogenation on terraces.29 Related to this, the hydrogenation of growing
hydrocarbon chains on the catalytic surface is also assumed to be
independent of the surface topology.14,15 A microkinetic
model that compares different mechanisms for the FT reaction on a
stepped Ru surface showed that hydrocarbons are mainly obtained via
direct CO dissociation; CR + CH type coupling reactions mainly produce
olefins as the primary products.30 A hypothesis
derived from these insights is that part of the (non-ASF) CH4 is obtained on terrace sites. However, direct evidence for this
speculation is lacking.

Carbon can be deposited on the surface
in different forms and is
considered to be one of the causes of catalyst deactivation.31 It has been established that amorphous carbon
and less structured carbon deposits can reversibly transform into
graphitic carbon, which kinetically and thermodynamically prefers
the flat surface of cobalt over the stepped surface.32−36 Accordingly, this makes it possible to selectively block the flat
surface by the Boudouard reaction (2CO → C + CO2), assuming that amorphous carbon can be easily removed. We have
previously shown that CO disproportionation via the Boudouard reaction
is a structure-sensitive reaction.37 It
occurs at a high rate in the absence of H2 but suffers
from rapid deactivation due to the buildup of carbon. In the present
work, we characterize in more detail the carbon species deposited
during the Boudouard reaction and their propensity toward hydrogenation.
In this way, we found that amorphous carbon can be removed by hydrogenation
at intermediate temperature, retaining the graphitic carbon. In this
way, we could investigate the impact of graphitic carbon on the FT
reaction, as well as the H2/C3H6 reaction.
The reaction data will be discussed in terms of a two-site model involving
step-edge sites for CO dissociation, chain growth, and termination,
while the terrace sites are involved in CH4 formation.
Blocking the latter sites by graphitic carbon suppresses CH4 formation. The concomitant increase in chain-growth probability
is explained by the suppressed migration of CHx intermediates from the step-edge sites to terrace sites.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Preparation and Basic Characterization
The Co/SiO2 catalyst containing 17.1 wt % Co and 0.04
wt % Pt (ICP-OES, Spectroblue, Ametek Inc.) was prepared by incipient
wetness impregnation of a silica support (120–250 μm,
provided by Shell) using an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (99.99%, Merck) and Pt(NH3)4·(NO3)2 (99.995%, Alfa Aesar)
as precursors. The detailed preparation of this catalyst can be found
in the literature.37 The accessible surface
area of 116.7 μmol of Co atoms/g of catalyst was determined
by H2-chemisorption (ASAP 2010, Micromeritics). The average
cobalt particle size of 15 nm was determined by TEM analysis (FEI
Tecnai 20) and confirmed by in situ XRD (D/max-2600, Rigaku).

2.2 Carbon Deposition and Temperature-Programmed
Hydrogenation
Carbon deposition and subsequent temperature-programmed
hydrogenation (TPH) were performed in a tubular reactor. Typically,
200 mg of the Co/SiO2 catalyst was reduced in situ in a
dilute H2 flow (20% H2 in Ar, 50 mL min–1 in total) at 450 °C (heating rate of 2 °C
min–1) and atmospheric pressure for 16 h and subsequently
flushed in an Ar flow for 2 h. Then, the reactor was cooled to the
desired carbon deposition temperature. Carbon was deposited by exposure
to a diluted CO flow (10% CO in Ar, 50 mL min–1 in
total). After deposition, the catalyst was flushed in Ar for 2 h and
cooled to room temperature. The TPH experiments were conducted by
heating the reactor to 550 °C at a rate of 5 °C min–1 under an H2 flow (10% H2 in
Ar, 50 mL min–1 in total). The main hydrocarbon
product of carbon hydrogenation was CH4, as followed by
an online mass spectrometer (ESS, GeneSys Evolution). To determine
the exact CH4 flow rate, the mass spectrometer (MS) signal
was calibrated using a known gas mixture. The amount of predeposited
carbon was determined by integrating the CH4 flow with
time on stream.

2.3 Quasi in Situ X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy
Carbon deposition on the Co/SiO2 catalyst
was studied
by quasi in situ XPS using a Kratos AXIS Ultra 600 spectrometer equipped
with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (Al Kα energy
is 1486.6 eV). Survey scans were recorded at pass energies of 160
and 40 eV for detailed region scans. The step size was 0.1 eV in both
cases, and the background pressure during the experiment was kept
below 5 × 10–6 mbar. A high-temperature reaction
cell (Kratos, WX-530) was used to pretreat the sample, which was supported
on an alumina stub, allowing in vacuo sample transfer into the XPS
measurement chamber.

The initial reduction was performed in
a 50% H2 in Ar flow at atmospheric pressure and 450 °C
for 8 h. After reduction the sample was cooled to 150 °C and
subsequently transferred to the measurement chamber. For the carbon
deposition, the sample was heated in a flow of 50 mL of Ar to 260
°C at a rate of 5 °C min–1. As soon as
the target temperature was reached, the gas flow was switched to a
flow of 20% CO in Ar. After the desired carbon deposition time, the
gas flow was stopped and the reaction cell was immediately evacuated
and cooled to room temperature. Energy calibration was done using
the Co 2p3/2 peak at 778.2 eV for the reduced samples and
the Si 2s peak at 103.3 eV of the SiO2 support for the
calcined sample.

2.4 Environmental Transmission
Electron Microscopy
Environmental transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were
recorded on a FEI ETEM instrument at an acceleration voltage of 300
kV. A ground sample was reduced in situ at 450 °C in a NanoEx-i/v
sample holder capable of heating. The reduced sample was exposed to
CO gas (12 mbar) at 260 °C for 1.5 h. TEM images were taken at
room temperature under vacuum.

2.5 Catalytic
Activity Measurements
Steady-state
and transient catalytic activity measurements were performed in a
setup that is capable of switching gas feeding. After reduction at
450 °C for 16 h, the reactor was cooled to the desired temperature
(220 or 260 °C) in an Ar flow and an increase in the pressure
to 2 bar. The flow was subsequently switched to a synthesis gas mixture
(CO/H2/Ar). The partial pressures of H2 and
CO were adjusted by varying their flow rates. The total flow rate
was fixed at 50 mL min–1 by using Ar as balance.
The activity and selectivity were measured by online analysis with
a VARIAN CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with FID and TCD for analysis
of hydrocarbon and permanent gases, respectively.

To study the
reactivity of predeposited carbon, a diluted 13CO flow
(10% 13CO in Ar, 50 mL min–1 in total)
was used to deposit isotopically labeled carbon at 260 °C for
30 min. Afterward, the 13CO flow was replaced by an Ar
flow to remove molecularly adsorbed 13CO. After flushing
with Ar for 2 h, the Ar flow was abruptly switched to a 12CO/H2 feed. The transient responses of H2 (m/z 2), 12CH4 (m/z 15), 13CH4 (m/z 17), 12CO (m/z 28), and 13CO (m/z 29) were monitored by online mass spectrometry.

Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) was performed
by switching from 12CO/H2/Ar to 13CO/H2/Ne when steady-state conversion was obtained, in
which the Ne was used as a tracer to determine the gas-phase hold-up
time. Procedures to determine the residence time and coverages of
CO and CHx (intermediates of CH4) are provided in our earlier work.38

3 Results
3.1 Carbon Deposition by CO
Exposure
In order to study the influence of surface carbon
deposits on the
CO hydrogenation reaction, carbon was deposited by the Boudouard reaction
(2CO → CO2 + C) on reduced Co/SiO2. We
employed TPH to determine the reactivity of the deposited carbon species. Figure 1 shows TPH profiles
as a function of the carbon deposition time and the carbon deposition
temperature. We distinguish two types of carbon species. The first
type of deposited carbon can be hydrogenated below 260 °C. Accordingly,
we can assign these carbon species to atomic carbon or amorphous carbon
on the basis of the literature.33,35,39,40 As the temperature at which these
amorphous carbon species can be hydrogenated is in the FT reaction
regime (200–240 °C), these carbon species are most likely
involved in the FT reaction. Figure 1a shows that the amount of the less reactive carbon
increases strongly during prolonged CO exposure. H2-chemisorption
data reported in Table 1 compare the metallic cobalt surface area of freshly reduced Co/SiO2 with samples exposed to CO and subsequently reduced at 260
°C to remove most of the reactive carbon species. Clearly, the
deposition of carbon species causes a strong decrease in the metallic
cobalt surface area. CO exposure at 260 °C for 3 h decreases
the surface that can be probed by H2 chemisorption by about
95%.

Figure 1 TPH profiles of the carbon deposits obtained by CO exposure at
260 °C for different times (a) and at different temperatures
for 30 min (b). The amount of carbon was quantified by integrating
the CH4 flow.

We also characterized
these carbon species by XPS. For this purpose,
we carried out similar carbon deposition experiments on an in situ
reduced Co/SiO2 catalyst in a reaction chamber directly
attached to an XPS spectrometer. A highly oriented pyrolytic graphite
reference was used to fit the sp2 carbon in C 1s spectra.41Figure 2 (left) shows that this procedure leads to sp2 and
sp3 carbon species as follows from the C 1s states at 284
and 285 eV, respectively.41 The amount
of sp2 carbon increases with CO exposure time. Exposure
of the carbon deposits to H2 at 260 °C results in
a decrease of the amount of sp3 carbon, while the intensity
of sp2 carbon remains nearly unchanged. This result highlights
the low reactivity of sp2 carbon. XPS quantification shows
that about 88% of the carbon species after 4 h of CO exposure at 260
°C is sp2 carbon. As hexagonal graphite, primarily
consisting of sp2 carbon, is commensurate with the hexagonal
close-packed surface of cobalt terraces,40,42 we conclude that the less reactive carbon is graphitic. The contribution
of carbidic carbon (282.9 eV40,43,44) after 4 h of CO exposure at 260 °C is below 1%. XPS spectra
of the Co 2p region are presented in Figure 2. An asymmetric peak shape was used to fit
the metallic cobalt component.45 An Al
Kα excited cobalt L2M23M45 Auger
transition at 776.2 eV (2.2 eV fwhm) was added in the fitting procedure.45,46 The spectra do not contain evidence for the formation of cobalt
carbide, as the Co 2p binding energy of cobalt carbide47,48 is 0.4–0.6 eV lower than that of metallic Co (278.1 eV45). Environmental TEM images (Figure 3) of a cobalt particle before
and after 80 min exposure to 12 mbar of CO at 260 °C do not show
a significant change in the metallic cobalt structure, confirming
that formation of cobalt carbide can be excluded. The formation of
a carbon adlayer on the cobalt particle cannot be clearly seen from
these environmental TEM measurements, although the diffraction pattern
in the fast Fourier transform of the selected area suggest the formation
of an amorphous layer on the surface. It has been shown before that
CO exposure at much higher temperature leads to formation of multilayered
graphitic carbon enwrapping the cobalt particle.49

regions (right) of the Co/SiO2 catalyst: after reduction

(b) and 4 h (c), and finally hydrogenation at 260 °C for 5 min
(d).

patterns of
selected areas of a cobalt nanoparticle in the in situ reduced Co/SiO2 catalyst before (a–c) and after
(d–f) CO exposure at 260 °C (12 mbar, 80 min).

We also studied carbon deposition at lower temperature.
After CO
exposure at 220 °C (Figure 1b), the TPH profile shows the presence of multiple
carbon species below 260 °C. Moreover, a much lower amount of
graphitic carbon is formed in comparison to samples exposed to CO
at 260 °C. One can also see that the total amount of amorphous
carbon is much less affected by the deposition temperature and deposition
time in comparison to the amount of graphitic carbon. This suggests
that the more reactive amorphous carbon species are the primary products
of CO dissociation and that these species are slowly converted into
a more stable graphitic form.33−36 It has been reported that the transformation between
these carbon species is reversible.33

Quantifying the deposited carbon reveals that the amount of amorphous
carbon does not change markedly, either with the carbon deposition
time (Figure 1a) or
with the carbon deposition temperature (Figure 1b). This is in keeping with a surface science
study by Nakamura et al., who investigated carbon deposition on a
polycrystalline cobalt foil.34 Accordingly,
we speculate that this type of carbon is closely associated with surface
cobalt sites involved in CO activation. Considering the absence of
H2 during carbon deposition, it is likely that step edges
are the active sites for CO dissociation.50,51 In a recent study, we also emphasized the importance of a minority
site on the surface involved in direct CO dissociation.37 In the absence of H2, the O atoms
can only be removed as CO2, leading to the predominant
coverage of the cobalt surface with carbon. Because of the low diffusion
barrier, i.e. 26 kJ mol–1 on Co(0001),42,52 carbon atoms can easily migrate over the cobalt surface and form
agglomerates of carbon atoms through C–C coupling reactions
on terraces. Additional DFT calculations estimate the migration barrier
for diffusion of a C atom from the 4-fold step-edge site to the terrace
to be 75 kJ mol–1.30 Coupling
between C atoms is much easier on terraces than on steps with respective
activation barriers of 118 and 234 kJ mol–1, respectively.32 Formation of (poly)aromatic structures containing
predominantly sp2 carbon can explain the low reactivity
of these deposits.42 It has also been reported
that the hexagonal graphite structure is thermodynamically favorable
on the close-packed surface.40,42Figure 1b clearly shows that the formation of graphitic
carbon is facilitated by higher CO exposure temperature.34,35 We therefore conclude that the graphitic carbon formed via CO exposure
mainly covers the terrace sites that dominate the surface of the relatively
large cobalt nanoparticles in Co/SiO2. Furthermore, the
step-edge sites will also contain a variety of carbon species.

The reactivity of the carbon deposits is demonstrated in Figure 4, where a 12CO/H2 flow is passed over the 13C-precovered
Co/SiO2 catalyst. The transient response shows that 13CH4 appears concomitantly with H2,
demonstrating the involvement of predeposited 13C in 13CH4 formation at 260 °C. 12CO
adsorption and hydrogenation cannot proceed until a certain amount
of free sites is regenerated by 13C hydrogenation. This
causes a 1.5 s delay (corrected for the chromatographic effect of
CO) of 12CH4 formation in comparison to 13CH4 formation. Taking into account the TPH profile
in Figure 1 and quantifying
the amount of 13CH4 formed, we find that a part
of the reactive 13C deposits is hydrogenated to 13CH4 after the switch to a H2-containing feed.
The remainder of the 13C species, mainly in the form of
graphitic carbon, stays on the surface. The influence of these residual
carbon deposits on the catalyst under model FT conditions will be
discussed below.

squares), 12CH4 (solid squares), 12CO (circles),
and H2 (triangles) following an Ar → 12CO/H2 switch over a 13C-precovered Co/SiO2 catalyst obtained by 13CO exposure at 260 °C
for 30 min followed by Ar flushing for 2 h (conditions: ρH2 = 200 mbar, ρCO = 200 mbar, T = 260 °C).

3.2 Influence of Carbon Deposits on the CO Hydrogenation
Reaction
As confirmed by Figure 1a, the amount of the graphitic carbon strongly
increases with the carbon deposition time. In this way, we can study
the CO hydrogenation reaction on cobalt catalysts that are precovered
with different amounts of graphitic carbon. The resulting data are
reported in Figure 5. The catalytic performance is plotted as a function of graphitic
carbon to surface cobalt ratio (denoted as Cgraph/Cosurf). Cgraph relates to the amount of carbon hydrogenated
above 260 °C in separate TPH experiments. All of the data in Figure 5 were obtained after
6 h time on stream under model FT reaction conditions. The model FT
reactions were carried out at 260 and 220 °C and a H2/CO ratio of 1.

Co/SiO2 as a function of graphitic carbon to surface cobalt
ratio (denoted as Cgraph/Cosurf): (a, b) CO
conversion (squares), CH4 yield (circles), C2+ yield (triangles), CO2 yield (diamonds), and chain-growth
probability (stars, based on C3–C6 hydrocarbons);
(c, d) C2 (left) and C3 products (right) yields.
Conditions: ρH2 = 200 mbar, ρCO = 200 mbar, T = 260 °C (a, c) and
220 °C (b, d). The error bars present the systematic error introduced
by the carbon quantification that is done by integrating the TPH profiles
on a calibrated online MS.

We first verified whether amorphous carbon influences the
catalytic
performance. The open symbols in Figure 5a represent the experiment in which CO exposure
at 260 °C for 30 min was followed by hydrogenation at 260 °C
for 2 h in order to remove most of the amorphous carbon. The resulting
reaction data are nearly identical with those obtained without the
hydrogenation step at 260 °C, demonstrating that predeposited
amorphous carbon does not influence the FT performance. This is expected,
as most of the amorphous carbon can be easily removed below 260 °C
in a TPH experiment (Figure 1). This leads to the conclusion that the effect of carbon
deposition on the model FT reaction at 260 °C to be discussed
below is mainly exerted by the presence of graphitic carbon.

Figure 5a,b reveals
that the presence of graphitic carbon decreases the CO consumption
rate under both reaction conditions. The activity decrease is more
evident at 260 °C than at 220 °C. Strikingly, these data
also show that graphitic carbon affects the formation rates of different
products in profoundly different ways. While the decrease in CO consumption
rate is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the CH4 yield, the yield of C2+ hydrocarbon products (paraffins
and olefins containing two or more carbon atoms) remains nearly the
same. In addition, the chain-growth probability (based on C3–C6 hydrocarbons) increases with the graphitic
carbon content of the precovered catalyst. At 260 °C, the chain-growth
probability increases from 0.43 for the clean cobalt surface to 0.61
for the nearly completely poisoned cobalt surface. When the reaction
is carried out at 220 °C, the chain-growth probability also changes
from 0.70 to 0.82 due to the presence of graphitic carbon. Concomitant
with the decrease in CH4 yield, we see that the CO2 yield is decreased for both cases. Clearly, these data show
that partial poisoning of the cobalt surface by graphitic carbon substantially
inhibits CO conversion as well as CH4 and CO2 formation. On the other hand, graphitic carbon hardly affects the
rate of formation of higher hydrocarbons, while on average longer
hydrocarbons are obtained.

Figure 5c,d illustrates
the strong impact of graphitic carbon on the paraffin to olefin ratio.
At 260 °C, its presence suppresses the formation of C2H6 and C3H8 and slightly increases
the formation of C2H4 and C3H6. Notably, the C2H6/C2H4 and C3H8/C3H6 ratios decrease by more than 95%: i.e., from 13.7 and 0.89 to 0.94
and 0.099, respectively. These relative changes are quantitatively
consistent with the relative decrease in the CH4 yield
(88%) and the loss of cobalt surface as determined by the amount of
carbon deposited by the TPH experiment (>90%). A similar trend
is
observed for the experiments carried out at 220 °C (Figure 5d). Experimental8,53 and theoretical30 studies have shown
that olefins are the primary products of the FT reaction. Paraffins
are therefore mostly obtained by hydrogenation of the primary olefins.

In order to establish how the graphitic carbon influences CO coverage
and the hydrogenation rate, we carried out SSITKA measurements at
260 °C. Figure 6 compares the resulting residence time and coverages of CO and CHx. With increasing graphitic carbon content,
the CO coverage decreases. There is a strong correlation between the
decrease in CO coverage and the loss of cobalt surface area as determined
by H2 chemisorption. The longer CHx residence time with increasing graphitic carbon content implies
slower CHx hydrogenation to CH4. This can be the result of two factors: i.e., (i) a decrease in
the H coverage and (ii) a decrease in the amount of surface sites
that produce mainly CH4.

Figure 6 Residence times (blue) and coverages (red)
of CHx (squares) and CO (circles) as determined
by SSITKA over carbon-precovered
Co/SiO2 catalysts as a function of Cgraph/Cosurf (conditions: ρH2 = 200 mbar,
ρCO = 200 mbar, T = 260 °C).
The error bars present the systematic error introduced by the carbon
quantification that is done by integrating the TPH profiles on a calibrated
online MS.

Consequently, the results presented
in this section demonstrate
a different effect of graphitic carbon on the various reaction routes
from synthesis gas to CH4 and higher hydrocarbons. While
CO conversion, CH4 and CO2 formation, and olefin
hydrogenation are substantially inhibited by graphitic carbon, the
rate of formation of C2+ hydrocarbons is hardly affected.
The results imply that the reaction pathway from CO to CH4 is suppressed to a larger degree by graphitic carbon in comparison
to that of CO to higher hydrocarbons. While the yield of higher hydrocarbons
only decreases slightly, the chain-growth probability substantially
increases due to the presence of graphitic carbon. Before discussing
these results in more detail, we will demonstrate that graphitic carbon
species also slowly build up on an initially clean cobalt surface
during CO hydrogenation and affect the catalytic performance in a
manner similar to that shown in this section.

3.3 Influence
of Carbon Deposits Formed during
the FT Reaction
To study the buildup of carbon deposits during
CO hydrogenation, we carried out model FT reaction experiments at
H2/CO ratios of 1 and 2 at 220 and 260 °C. Quantification
of the carbon deposits by integrating the TPH profiles of spent catalysts
allows establishing the correlation between carbon deposition and
catalytic performance. In this case, we removed a significant part
of the amorphous carbon in a H2 flow at the reaction temperature
for 6 h. Thereafter, the content of graphitic carbon on spent catalysts
can be quantified by TPH.

As shown in Table 2, the amount of graphitic carbon increases
with time on stream of the FT reaction. Figure 7a shows that the CO consumption rate at 260
°C decreases much more quickly with time on stream in comparison
to that at 220 °C, while the effects are also less pronounced
at a H2/CO ratio of 2. This difference can be explained
by the larger amount of graphitic carbon deposited at higher temperature
and lower H2/CO ratio.54 Accordingly,
we propose that the initial decrease in the CO consumption rate can
be assigned to carbon deposition. Notably, there are also differences
in the reactivity of the deposited graphitic carbon. Typically, the
amount of graphitic carbon increases with the reaction temperature.
We highlight the effect of the graphitic carbon buildup on the CH4 and C2+ hydrocarbon yields in Figure 7b. These data are normalized
to the initial values. In all cases, the CH4 yields decrease
much more quickly than the C2+ hydrocarbon yields and the
effect is most pronounced at 260 °C and at low H2/CO
ratio.

Figure 8 shows the
evolution of the selectivity from C1 to C6 and
the corresponding chain-growth probability obtained at 260 °C
and a H2/CO ratio of 1 with time on stream, reflecting
the effect of graphitic carbon buildup during the reaction. Clearly,
the CH4 selectivity decreases substantially, while the
influence on the C2+ hydrocarbon yield is much less pronounced.
At the same time, the yield of higher hydrocarbons increases with
the ongoing reaction. Another remarkable observation is that the selectivity
of longer hydrocarbons increases more pronouncedly than the selectivity
of shorter hydrocarbons, fully consistent with the increasing chain-growth
probability. Finally, we plot the relative decrease in product yields
with respect to the initial values as a function of the Cgraph/Cosurf ratio in Figure 9. The decrease in CH4 yield is strongly
correlated with the graphitic carbon coverage. In contrast, the correlation
of the C2+ hydrocarbon yield with the graphitic carbon
coverage is much weaker.

3.4 Influence
of Carbon Deposits on Chain Growth
In order to understand
how chain growth is influenced by graphitic
carbon, we studied the conversion of a C3H6/H2 mixture on freshly reduced and carbon-covered cobalt catalysts.
In an earlier work, we coreacted 13CO/H2 synthesis
gas with 12C3H6 to investigate the
reversibility of chain growth and the inclusion of carbon species
resulting from C–C bond cleavage reactions in propene into
higher hydrocarbons.55 Here, we did not
use CO as a reactant in order to exclude any influence of CO coverage.55 The cobalt catalyst containing graphitic carbon
was prepared by 13CO exposure at 260 °C for 30 min
followed by H2 exposure at 260 °C for 30 min. By using
labeled 13CO for deposition, we can track the origin of
the carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon products in subsequent C3H6/H2 reaction experiments. C3H6 is completely converted in these experiments, and C3H8 is the major product for both cases. The other products
are hydrocarbons lighter and heavier than C3 hydrocarbons.
The selectivity results are collected in Figure 10 in the form of a plot of the logarithmic
molar fraction as a function of the carbon number (ASF plot). These
data demonstrate that the product distribution obtained from a C3H6/H2 mixture is qualitatively similar
to the typical ASF-type product distribution obtained with synthesis
gas.55Figure 10 shows a lower CH4 selectivity
for the catalysts that contain graphitic carbon, consistent with the
lower hydrogenation activity of the carbon-covered catalyst. At the
same time, the chain-growth probability based on the C4–C7 hydrocarbon products increases from 0.23 for
the initially clean cobalt catalyst to 0.42 for the cobalt catalyst
that was precovered with graphitic carbon. These results are qualitatively
in good agreement with the changes in the chain-growth probability
due to the presence of graphitic carbon during the FT reaction. Isotopic
analysis by GC-MS shows that the 13C content in the hydrocarbon
products is lower than 0.2%, confirming that the predeposited graphitic
carbon species are not involved in the chain-growth reactions.

C3 products were excluded from the selectivity calculations
(conditions: T = 220 °C, ρH2 = 600 mbar, ρC3H6 =
60 mbar).

4 Discussion
The detailed mechanism of the FT reaction is far from understood.
The FT reaction involves many elementary reaction steps, some of which
are structure sensitive while others are expected to not depend significantly
on the surface topology. Identifying how blocking of part of the catalyst
surface affects activity and selectivity may provide deeper insight
into the reaction mechanism and site requirements. In this study,
we investigated how carbon deposits on the cobalt surface affect the
CO consumption rate and the product distribution of the FT reaction.

By using the Boudouard reaction to cover a substantial part of
the metallic surface by graphitic carbon, we demonstrate that the
catalytic surface contains different sites involved in the production
of CH4 and higher hydrocarbons. The cobalt catalyst used
contains ∼15 nm particles. This size is larger than the minimum
size of 6 nm, below which the catalytic performance is strongly dependent
on particle size.56,57 The surface of the nanoparticles
in the present work will predominantly contain low-reactive planar
surfaces, while about 20% of the surface will be made up of defects
in the form of corners, edges, and step edges.58 By combining 12C16O/13C18O isotopic scrambling with in situ infrared spectroscopy,
we have demonstrated earlier that direct CO dissociation proceeds
predominantly on step-edge sites.37 This
is consistent with the expected strong structure sensitivity of the
CO dissociation reaction.

The main observation made in this
work is that CH4 and
CO2 formation rates and the paraffin to olefin ratio are
substantially suppressed by the presence of graphitic carbon, while
the rate of higher hydrocarbon formation hardly changes. This result
cannot be explained by assuming a surface that contains only one type
of site, as one would expect a decrease in CO conversion without changes
in selectivity. Accordingly, we discuss these findings in the framework
of a surface that contains both step edge and terraces, as typically
assumed in cobalt-catalyzed FT synthesis.32,50,59 Our data show a very strong correlation
among the CH4 selectivity, the paraffin to olefin ratio,
and the available cobalt surface, even for a catalyst in which more
than 90% of the available cobalt sites were covered by graphitic carbon.
Thus, we infer that a large part of CH4 originates from
CHx hydrogenation on terrace sites, which
is in keeping with the notion that CHx hydrogenation to CH4 is not a structure-sensitive reaction.14 The observation of significantly inhibited olefin
hydrogenation lines up with the dependence of CH4 formation
rate on graphitic carbon content. The observation that the yield of
C2+ hydrocarbons is less affected is in keeping with the
proposal that olefins are the primary product of the FT reaction.8,30,53 Thus, the terraces are responsible
for the hydrogenation of the primary olefin products, which is a structure-insensitive
reaction as well. Similarly, the CO2 yield correlates with
the CH4 yield, identifying the terrace surfaces as the
major source of CO2 formation. In contrast, the C2+ hydrocarbon formation rate changes only slightly when more than
90% of the surface is blocked. We therefore conclude that higher hydrocarbon
formation occurs on a small fraction of the surface sites, which are
most likely step-edge sites.15,58 Although the C2+ hydrocarbon formation rate is hardly affected by graphitic
carbon, the chain-growth probability is increased. This is in line
with prolonged CHx residence time, implying
that more CHx species can be built into
growing chains. Altogether, our data are consistent with the view
that CO dissociation and chain-growth reactions are structure sensitive
and preferred on step-edge sites,29,32 while hydrogenation
and oxidation occur on the whole surface.14,15

An important aspect to be considered is the migration of surface
adsorbates between the different types of surface sites. On the basis
of the strong correlation between cobalt surface area and CH4 formation rate, we speculate that the terrace sites are the origin
of a large part of the production of CH4. If we exclude
migration of CHx species from step-edge
to terrace sites, CO dissociation leading to CH4 must take
place on the terrace sites. CO dissociation with assistance of adsorbed
H on planar sites has been extensively discussed as an alternative
to direct CO dissociation on step edges.22−27 DFT calculations show that the H-assisted CO dissociation on terrace
sites is feasible,24,27 although the activation barrier
is higher than that on step-edge sites.22 We refer to the work of Iglesia,23,26,27 who proposed that the FT reaction exclusively takes
place on cobalt terrace sites. However, this view cannot explain the
distinct dependence of CH4 and C2+ formation
rates on carbon deposits, as well as the increase in chain-growth
probability. Following this one-site model, one would not expect any
change in selectivity when the catalyst surface is partially covered.
We therefore also consider that H-assisted CO dissociation occurs
on terrace sites, which mainly leads to CH4, while CO dissociation
taking place on step-edge sites leads to C2+ hydrocarbons
and a small amount of CH4. In other words, we cannot exclude
that two parallel reaction pathways exist on terraces and steps. This
thought provides an explanation for the decreased CO consumption rate
in the presence of graphitic carbon. Notably, the CO consumption rate
decreases with increasing graphitic carbon content, but not proportionally
with the loss of cobalt surface area nor with the CO coverage or with
the CH4 formation rate. This is because the contribution
of CO consumption via CO dissociation on step-edge sites is less affected
by graphitic carbon in comparison to the route on terraces.

We provide an alternative scenario taking into account the migration
of surface adsorbates between step-edge and terrace sites. We contrast
the previous case by assuming that CO dissociation exclusively occurs
at step edges. Then, C and O fragments obtained by CO dissociation
can diffuse from the step edges to the terrace sites. C will be converted
to mainly CH4, because chain growth is not favorable on
terrace sites.15,32 At a low H2/CO ratio,
a fraction of these C atoms will be converted to graphitic carbon,
as we observed in the present work, causing deactivation.54 Similarly, O migrating to terraces will be converted
to CO2 due to the high CO coverage. Graphitic carbon on
terrace sites will suppress CH4 and CO2 formation,
in line with our experimental observations. Our earlier work shows
that the CO consumption rate under methanation conditions is mainly
limited by CHx hydrogenation, meaning
that suppression of CH4 formation will cause a corresponding
decrease in CO conversion. It also implies that blocking terrace sites
slows CHx hydrogenation to CH4, thereby increasing the residence time of CHx fragments. Thus, the CHx fragment
will reside longer on step-edge sites, resulting in a higher chain-growth
probability. The higher coverage at the step-edge sites also suppresses
cleavage of the growing hydrocarbon chains.55 This view is also consistent with the C3H6/H2 reaction experiments (Figure 10), in which C–C coupling is facilitated
by the presence of graphitic carbon on terraces, since (i) CHx migration to terraces is suppressed and
(ii) higher CHx coverage on step-edge
sites suppresses C–C cleavage. Of equal importance is then
the observation that the presence of graphitic carbon during C3H6/H2 conversion decreases the CH4 selectivity. This directly proves that C species formed at
step edges can migrate to terrace sites and that graphitic carbon
suppresses this migration. We propose that H-assisted CO dissociation
on terraces can play a role in the overall CO consumption, but it
will mainly lead to CH4. Indeed, if C species originating
from terrace sites would be involved in chain growth on step edges
via migration, one would expect the C2+ hydrocarbons yield
to decrease due to graphitic carbon. Therefore, this scenario can
be excluded.

Our approach to selectively poison the surface
with graphitic carbon
provides new insight into the structure sensitivity of the FT reaction.
Specifically, we have demonstrated that step-edge sites are the main
active sites for the FT reaction. Graphitic carbon can slowly build
up on terrace sites during CO hydrogenation. The buildup of such graphitic
carbon occurs more quickly at higher temperature and lower H2/CO ratio. On the time scale of our reaction (45 h), it is observed
that a considerable amount of graphitic carbon is deposited at 260
°C. Under more typical FT conditions (T = 220
°C; H2/CO = 2), the buildup is much slower. The in
situ produced graphitic carbon has an effect similar to that of predeposited
graphitic carbon. Figure 9 shows that the decrease in CH4 selectivity strongly
correlates with the graphitic carbon content. The decrease in the
C2+ hydrocarbon yield is very low and is only substantial
when nearly the complete surface is poisoned.

In this respect,
it is important to emphasize again that CH4 selectivity
is an important parameter in practical FT technology.7,8,11 Our data show that formation
of non-ASF CH4 can be attributed to
the structure sensitivity of the FT reaction. For instance, Figure 11 confirms the formation
of non-ASF CH4 and its decrease with an increasing amount
of graphitic carbon. It is also consistent with the microkinetics
simulations carried out for stepped Ru in which a lower than ASF-predicted
CH4 selectivity is found.30 In
this respect, it is worthwhile to cite two computational works that
have involved different surface sites in predicting cobalt catalytic
performance.59,60 Liu et al. studied the chain-growth
mechanism on a Co(101̅1) surface. Their results confirm that
the stepped surface exhibits good selectivity toward C2+ hydrocarbons,60 which is consistent with
our observation that a small fraction of surface sites is responsible
for higher hydrocarbon formation. Van Helden et al. explored a combination
of step-edge sites for CO dissociation and terrace sites for chain
growth using first-principles kinetic parameters obtained for cobalt
surfaces.59 The reactions assigned to the
different surface sites in van Helden’s studies are not consistent
with our experimental observations.

Figure 11 ASF distribution determined after 1 h
(squares), 5 h (circles),
15 h (triangles), and 45 h (diamonds) time on stream (conditions:
ρH2 = 200 mbar, ρCO =
200 mbar, T = 260 °C).

Finally, we contrast the above interpretation with two important
works on the FT reaction. Schulz has also discussed considerable changes
in the CO conversion and product distribution for supported cobalt
under typical FT conditions.8,61,62 Notably, he observed an increasing olefin to paraffin ratio and
chain-growth probability and decreasing CH4 selectivity
during the initial stages for a cobalt–rhenium catalyst. This
is qualitatively similar to our observations. Schulz attributed these
changes in part to the buildup of CO on planar sites, which for longer
reaction times caused surface reconstruction.61 This surface reconstruction led to an increase in the fraction of
step-edge sites on the catalyst surface. Another relevant study was
recently reported by Ralston et al.,63 who
observed that large cobalt particles (9.5 nm) contain more reactive
carbon species and catalyze chain growth more effectively than small
particles (4.3 nm). This observation is quantitatively consistent
with the fraction of B5–B sites, a certain type
of step-edge site.20,21,58,64 Therefore, the different performance between
small and large particles was attributed to the density of step-edge
sites. This conclusion is qualitatively in line with our work, as
the balance between step-edge sites responsible for CO dissociation
and chain propagation and terrace sites for CH4 formation
will determine the product distribution.

5 Conclusions
The influence of graphitic carbon on the FT reaction was investigated
in detail. Carbon was deposited by the Boudouard reaction, which involves
CO dissociation on step-edge sites, diffusion of C atoms to terrace
sites, and agglomeration of these C atoms. On the basis of TPH, amorphous
and graphitic carbon can be distinguished. Amorphous carbon can be
hydrogenated below 260 °C, while graphitic carbon can only be
removed by hydrogenation at much higher temperature. Consistent with
the low temperature at which amorphous carbon can be removed, it does
not influence the FT catalytic performance. The presence of predeposited
graphitic carbon, on the other hand, has a profound influence on CO
conversion and the product distribution. While CO conversion and CH4 formation rate decrease, the formation rate of higher hydrocarbon
is nearly unaffected by the presence of graphitic carbon. Additional
FT experiments designed to study the effect of in situ formed carbon
deposits led to the insight that slow buildup of graphitic carbon
has similar effects in comparison to the predeposition of graphitic
carbon. The formation of graphitic carbon is more pronounced at higher
temperature and at lower H2/CO ratio. We observe that the
products of the H2/C3H6 reaction
follow the typical ASF-type product distribution of the FT reaction.
The presence of graphic carbon using 13CO facilitates C–C
coupling reactions in terms of chain-growth probability, when the
Co/SiO2 catalyst is exposed to a C3H6/H2 mixture. Considering the structure sensitivity of
the various elementary reaction steps underlying the FT reaction,
we reach the conclusion that two sites must be involved in the FT
reaction. Step-edge sites catalyze CO dissociation and chain growth.
CHx species formed on step-edge sites
are involved in chain growth and CH4 formation on step-edge
sites and can also diffuse to terrace sites, where they are predominantly
hydrogenated to CH4. The terrace sites favor methanation,
thereby explaining the occurrence of non-ASF CH4. Under
particular conditions, graphitic carbon can build up on terrace sites,
therefore decreasing non-ASF CH4. We emphasize that this
new understanding about the origin of non-ASF CH4 in the
FT reaction can help to design improved catalysts. By selectively
blocking only the methanation sites and not CO dissociation and chain
growth sites, we believe that a decrease in methane selectivity can
be achieved without much loss in activity toward higher hydrocarbons.
