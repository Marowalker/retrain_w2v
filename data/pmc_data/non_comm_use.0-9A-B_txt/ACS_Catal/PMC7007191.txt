Hydride transfer
is widespread in nature and has an essential role
in applied research. However, the mechanisms of how this transformation
occurs in living organisms remain a matter of vigorous debate. Here,
we examined dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that catalyzes
hydride from C4′ of NADPH to C6 of 7,8-dihydrofolate (H2F). Despite many investigations of the mechanism of this reaction,
the contribution of polarization of the π-bond of H2F in driving hydride transfer remains unclear. H2F was
stereospecifically labeled with deuterium β to the reacting
center, and β-deuterium kinetic isotope effects were measured.
Our experimental results combined with analysis derived from QM/MM
simulations reveal that hydride transfer is triggered by polarization
at the C6 of H2F. The σ Cβ–H
bonds contribute to the buildup of the cationic character during the
chemical transformation, and hyperconjugation influences the formation
of the transition state. Our findings provide key insights into the
hydride transfer mechanism of the DHFR-catalyzed reaction, which is
a target for antiproliferative drugs and a paradigmatic model in mechanistic
enzymology.

Introduction
Hydride transfer, a
ubiquitous event found in all living organisms,
has been subjected to intense investigation with the aim of deciphering
the physicochemical basis of enzyme catalysis.1,2 Despite
a wealth of studies,3−8 a model that comprehensively illustrates the unparalleled catalytic
power of enzymes is still lacking. Irrespective of whether electrostatics,
dynamic coupling, and quantum tunneling contribute to an enzyme’s
rate acceleration, all existing theories are built on the accepted
principle of transition state stabilization.9,10 Hence,
the comprehensive characterization of enzyme transition states is
essential.

Using dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) as a model system,
we explored
the role played by hyperconjugation in driving hydride transfer. DHFR
catalyzes the reduction of 7,8-dihydrofolate (H2F) to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate
(H4F) via transfer of the C4′ pro-R hydride from NADPH to the C6 Re-face of H2F (Figure 1).11 DHFR is central in regulating the metabolic
flux of the one-carbon cycle. Inhibitors of DHFR have broad applications
in pharmacotherapy,12 and trimethoprim,
pyrimethamine, and methotrexate are frequently used in therapy.13,14 There is, however, an emerging resistance to these drugs, and a
better understanding of the mechanism underlying DHFR catalysis is
needed to aid the design of new anti-DHFR drugs.13−17

located at the β positions of the C6 of H2F are highlighted. pABA-Glu = p-aminobenzoyl-l-glutamate.

The kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is a powerful
tool to investigate
enzyme mechanisms.8,9,18−20 During DHFR catalysis, hydride transfer to C6 and
protonation of the N5 of H2F occur (see Figure 1). Accordingly, both N5 and
C6 of H2F change from sp2 to sp3 hybridization,
while C4′ of NADPH alternates from sp3 to sp2. Depending on the location of the isotopic label, there are
two main classes of KIE that can be measured. Primary KIEs arise when
atoms directly involved in the chemical transformation are replaced
by their heavy counterparts.6,19,21−23 Primary KIE measurements for NADPH(D) and heavy-atom
(15N, 13C) isotope labeling of the primary reacting
centers have generated evidence in support of a stepwise mechanism
for DHFR from E. coli (EcDHFR).21,22,24,25 Secondary α-deuterium KIEs (α-KIEs) arising
from the rehybridization of C4′ of NADPH provide atomistic
insights into local environmental changes during the chemical transformation,
as isotopic substitution influences the rehybridization process of
the primary atoms, which is reflected as a change in reaction rate.23,26−28 However, despite EcDHFR being one
of the most studied enzymes, the role of C6 rehybridization in H2F has never been investigated in detail. Because the four
hydrogens on C7 and C9 of H2F are located in positions
β to C6, secondary β-deuterium isotope effects (β-KIEs)
can be measured to explore the extent of C6 rehybridization. In general,
β-KIE values fall between 1.15 and 1.25, similar to those of
α-KIEs (from 1.1 to 1.2),29 and this
has been attributed to hyperconjugation, a quantum mechanical effect
where σ Cβ–H(D) bonds partially donate
electrons to the neighboring electron-deficient π-bond.19,30−35 β-KIE measurements have been depicted in many enzyme catalysts,36−44 and they have been exploited to investigate reactions where hyperconjugation
is likely to contribute to the stabilization of the enzymatic transition
state. These include fumarate hydratase,36 subtilisin,37 β-lactamase,38,39 chorismate synthase,40 purine nucleoside
phosphorylase,41 DNA glycosylases,42,43 and enzyme-catalyzed acyl transfer reactions.44 When the N5–C6 double bond is converted to a single
bond during EcDHFR catalysis, the magnitude of this
σ → π* effect can be different in the reactant
and transition states (RS and TS), provoking a variation of the Cβ–H stretching force constants and leading to
a measurable β-isotope effect. Given the nature of hyperconjugation,
β-KIEs are also conformation dependent, with the maximum magnitude
being obtained when the σ Cβ–H(D) bond
is aligned to the electron-deficient π-network,35,45−47 and hence an angular dependence of the β-KIEs
is expected. Nevertheless, because the preparation of the corresponding
deuterated H2F remains a nontrivial task, the corresponding
β-KIE measurement has not been conducted.

Here, a versatile
synthetic strategy is described to produce H2Fs that are
regio- and stereospecifically deuterated at the
C7 and C9 positions. The use of deuterated H2Fs in β-KIE
measurements combined with QM/MM simulations reveal that the C6 hydride
acceptor of H2F is polarized upon approaching the TS. Conformation-dependent
hyperconjugative effects play a key role in the progression of the
hydride transfer reaction from the RS to the TS.

Results and Discussion
Chemoenzymatic
Synthesis of Folate Deuterated on C7 and C9
An adaptation
of our chemoenzymatic synthesis of dihydrofolate
(H2F) was used for deuterium incorporation at C7 and C9
of H2F (Figure 2).25 Folic acid from a commercial
source was transformed into 6-formylpterin (6-FP) by oxidation with
sodium sulfite under acidic conditions.48 Replacing exchangeable protons with their deuterated counterparts
eventually leads to deuterium enrichment at the aldehydic position
(93%). Upon reduction with dimethylaminoborane (DMAB) or its deuterated
equivalent, 6-FP was converted to 6-hydroxymethylpterin (6-HMP) or
6-HMP with deuterium selectively incorporated at the C9 position (90%
enrichment). Further reduction of 6-HMP with sodium dithionite led
to 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (6-HMDP). Likewise, the use of
D2O in place of water led to the incorporation of a deuterium
atom at the C7 position of the pterin ring (95% enrichment).49

Figure 2 Synthetic strategies to produce deuterium-labeled H2Fs. (a) Folic acid was converted into 6-formylpterin (6-FP)
by oxidation
with sodium sulfite under acidic conditions.48 Subsequently, 6-FP was reduced to 6-hydroxymethylpterin (6-HMP)
by dimethylaminoborane (DMAB). Further reduction of 6-HMP by sodium
dithionite affords 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin (6-HMDP),49 which was enzymatically transformed to H2F by the combined actions of 6-hydroxymethyl 7,8-dihydropterin
pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS).25 (b) Reduction of deuterated 6-FP (6-FP-d) with either (S)- or (R)-alpine borane offers an alternative route to stereoselectively
introduce a deuterium in 6-HMP.51 Cofactor
recycling was operated by myokinase (MK) and pyruvate kinase (PK).25,50 Details can be found in the Supporting Information.

6-HMDP is a metabolite of the
folate de novo biosynthetic
pathway and thus can be transformed in vitro to H2F (Figure 2a) with 6-hydroxymethyl
7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase (HPPK) and dihydropteroate synthase
(DHPS).25 In the first step, 6-HMDP was
added with pyrophosphate by HPPK. Formation of 6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropterin
diphosphate uses 1 equiv of ATP (6-HMDPpp); therefore, a regeneration
system of the cofactor based on myokinase (MK) and pyruvate kinase
(PK) was included.50 6-HMDPpp was subsequently
combined with p-aminobenzoyl-l-glutamic
acid (pABA-Glu) to afford H2F. The use
of deuterated reagents in each synthetic step allowed the production
of [7-2H], [9-2H], [9,9-2H2], [7,9-2H2] and [7,9,9-2H3] H2F, respectively.

Since hyperconjugation relies
on the position of the β Cβ–H bond with
respect to the π*-bond, we
predict that the magnitude of the β-KIE is dependent on the
dihedral angle between Cβ–H and C6–N5.35,45−47 Consequently, (S)- and (R)-[9-2H] H2F were produced by further
modifying the synthetic pathway (Figure 2b). Deuterated 6-FP (6-FP-d) was reduced to (S)- and (R)-[9-2H] 6-HMP with (R)- and (S)-alpine borane, respectively (Midland reduction, Figure 2b),51,52 and their absolute configurations were determined by a Mosher ester
analysis (Supporting Information).53 As detailed above, (R)- and
(S)-[9-2H] 6-HMP were chemoenzymatically
converted in (S)- and (R)-[9-2H] H2F, respectively. It should be noted that the
stereochemistry at C9 undergoes inversion during the nucleophilic
displacement catalyzed by DHPS from R to S and vice versa.54 Because both
(S)- and (R)-[9-2H] H2F share the same isotope source, 6-FP-d,
the degree of isotopic enrichment (93%) between them is identical.

Experimental and Theoretical Determination of β-KIEs
To investigate rehybridization of C6 of H2F in the hydride
transfer TS of EcDHFR, deuterated H2Fs
produced in this work were used to measure experimental β-KIEs
(Figure 2, Figures S1–S24, and Table 1). At pH 7.0 under pre-steady-state conditions
between 5 and 35 °C, inverse β-KIEs were obtained (Table 1, Tables S1–S5, and Figures S26–S29; see the Supporting Information for data collection and
processing). For racemic [7-2H] and [9-2H] H2Fs, the average β-KIEs were of 0.96 ± 0.01 and
0.96 ± 0.01, respectively, over the examined temperature range
(Table S1).

β-Deuterium isotope effects
mainly originate from hyperconjugation
between an electron-deficient π-orbital and a vicinal σ-donor.35 As previously shown in solvolysis reactions,45,46 hyperconjugation is dependent on the dihedral angle (ϕ) between
the σ Cβ–H(D) and an electron-deficient
π-orbital, as they must align perpendicularly for maximum σ→
π* donation.35,45,46 Such a spatial requirement indicates that the magnitude of the β-KIE
is dependent on how the Cβ–H(D) bond aligns
to the electron-deficient π orbital. (R)-[9-2H] and (S)-[9-2H] H2F (93% enrichment) gave average β-KIEs of 0.960 ± 0.009
and 0.980 ± 0.005, respectively (Tables S1 and S5 and Figure S26). The use of mono-, di-, and trideuterated
H2Fs revealed that the magnitude of the inverse β-KIE
was proportional to the increase in deuterium enrichment (Tables S1–S5 and Figures S26–S29). The magnitudes of the β-KIEs measured for monodeuterated
H2Fs ([7-2H] and [9-2H] H2F) are lower than those measured with [7,9-2H2] (0.95 ± 0.01) and [9,9-2H2] H2F (0.952 ± 0.006) (Table S1). This
phenomenon becomes increasingly evident when [7,9,9-2H3] H2F is used, where the β-KIE value was
0.924 ± 0.006 between 5 and 35 °C (Table S1 and Figure S26).

Initial structures of the RS and
TS were selected from QM/MM simulations
corresponding to the minimum and maximum of the reaction free energy
profiles, which are computed in terms of a potential of mean force
(see the Supporting Information for details
and Figure S30). These structures were
fully optimized at the M06-2X/MM level with the 6-31G* basis set considering
the full flexible protein solvated in a box of water molecules. It
is important to point out that the potential energy barriers, which
could slightly change if a larger basis set was employed, are insensitive
to isotopic substitution; consequently, possible errors do not affect
the final evaluation of the KIEs. The resulting structures were then
characterized as being real minima (for the RS structures) or saddle
points (TS structures) by inspection of the corresponding Hessian
matrices. Similar to the case in previous studies,55−57 Hessians were
used to compute the partition functions for each of the structures
in the range of temperatures of the experiments. KIEs were evaluated
for each pair of TS and RS structures from the ratio between their
partition functions. In this regard, considering that the β-H(D)
is not transferred during the present process and evaluation of the
rate constant is not required for KIE calculations, quantum tunneling
effects have not been considered. The final averaged KIE values are
found as the arithmetic mean of all individual values for all the
pairs of TS and RS structures. While it would produce results that
are negligibly different from a numerical point of view, another possible
strategy would be to obtain the full averaged partition functions
and then calculate the KIE.58 Our results
are in excellent agreement with the experimental values (Tables S1 and S6–S12). AM1 values, also
reported in this work (see Tables S6–S12), are very similar to those obtained at the M06-2X/6-31G* level,
pointing out the convergence of our results with respect to the quantum
description.

The inverse β-KIEs, observed when the pro-R and/or pro-S hydrogen atoms (HR and
HS) of the C7 and C9 positions of H2F are substituted
by deuterium, originate from an increase in the force constants associated
with the movements of these hydrogen atoms during the evolution from
the RS to the TS. The averaged values of the stretching and bending
force constants associated with these hydrogen atoms were obtained
at the M06-2X/MM level (Table 2). The values provided in Table 2 illustrate an increase in the stretching
force constants of the four hydrogen atoms (H7R, H7S, H9R, and H9S) as the hydride transfer
advances from the RS to the TS, which can be related to hyperconjugation
(see above). A natural bond order (NBO) analysis performed with Gaussian16
on the optimized structures confirms that the delocalization of the
electronic density of the σ Cβ–H orbital
on the antibonding N5–C6 π-orbital stabilizes the system
by a quantity up to 3.36 ± 0.09 kcal mol–1 in
the RS.59,60

An analysis of the optimized structures shows how
the interatomic
N5–C6 distance increases from 1.29 ± 0.01 Å at the
RS to 1.39 ± 0.03 Å at the TS. The change in distance indicates
that the π-bond between these two atoms is broken, and it is
associated with a decrease of electron density at C6 which facilitates
hydride transfer (the charges on C6 of an isolated H2F
are 0.34 ± 0.01 and 0.49 ± 0.01 au at the RS and TS geometry,
respectively). The hyperconjugative effect vanishes while the double
bond is transformed into a single bond, and then the electron population
of the σ Cβ–H(D) bond is increased.
At the TS, the maximum stabilization energy due to the mixing of the
σ Cβ–H and the antibonding N5–C6
π-orbitals, as determined by the NBO analysis, is 2.54 ±
0.19 kcal mol–1. Consequently, the stretching force
constant of this bond is larger at the TS than that at the RS, resulting
in an inverse β-KIE when the respective hydrogens are replaced
with deuteriums. The ordering of the stretching force constants associated
with HR and HS in the TS can be rationalized by considering the degree of overlap
between the σ Cβ–H(D) bonds and the
N5–C6 π-bond (Figure 3). The N5–C6–C7–HR and N5–C6–C7–HS dihedral angles (ϕ) at the TS are −98
± 4 and 147 ± 4°, respectively, indicating a larger
overlap with the N5–C6 bond and hence a greater electron donation
effect in the case of the C7–HR bond. This explains the smaller value of the force constant of this
hydrogen with respect to that of C7–HS. For the C9 position, the values of the two N5–C6–C9–H
dihedral angles are much closer (−127 ± 2 and 120 ±
1° for HR and HS, respectively), in agreement with the observed similarity
between the two stretching force constants (Table 2). This correlation between the bond orientation
and the force constants reinforces our interpretation of the observed
inverse KIEs.

According to the calculations,
other force constants associated
with the hydrogen atoms in β positions are also partially responsible
for the inverse β-KIE. The bending motions of HR–Cβ–HS show a substantial increase in the corresponding
force constant (Table 2); we attribute this phenomenon to a “packing” effect
at the TS. Effectively, the hydrogen atoms on C7 and C9 experience
a more crowded environment at the TS than at the RS, thereby provoking
a tighter bending mode. In particular, the cofactor is substantially
closer to the substrate at the TS than at the RS on one side to facilitate
hydride transfer. The cofactor approaches the substrate from the side
of the H9R and H7S atoms (Figure 3), replacements of which with deuterium lead to a greater magnitude
of inverse β-KIEs (Tables S11 and S12). The distance of the H7S atom of the
substrate to the closer hydrogen atom of the cofactor is reduced from
2.51 ± 0.09 Å at the RS to 2.16 ± 0.05 Å at the
TS. On the other side, some active site residues also approach the
substrate to stabilize the TS. Thr46 is closer to C9 of the substrate
at the TS (the Cγ46-H9R distance
is reduced from 3.83 ± 0.03 to 3.47 ± 0.05 Å), while
Ile94 is in proximity to the C7 center (the O94–H7S distance is reduced from 2.54 ± 0.03 Å
at the RS to 2.39 ± 0.01 Å at the TS). The “packing”
effect around the TS also contributes to increasing the force constants
associated with the β-hydrogens, resulting in a larger zero-point
energy and an inverse KIE upon deuterium substitution. Interestingly,
this packing effect was also described in a recent theoretical study
focused exclusively on protonation of N5 of H2F.61 Electrostatic stabilization clearly affects
the whole N5–C6 double bond and surrounding β-hydrogens
in the EcDHFR-H2F complex, implying that
the role of the “packing effect” stabilization goes
well beyond modulating protonation of N5 of H2F.

Conclusions
In conclusion, our work illustrates how polarization triggers hydride
transfer in the DHFR catalysis. C6 of H2F possesses strong
carbenium ion character when it approaches the TS, and the buildup
of a partially positive charge is stabilized by the surrounding σ
Cβ–H bonds through hyperconjugation, a phenomenon
that is revealed here as an inverse β-KIE. Furthermore, as hyperconjugation
is most effective when the σ Cβ–H bond
is perpendicular to the π*-bond, the magnitude of β-KIE
depends on the stereochemistry. Computation indicates an increase
in the force constants of the bond motions (stretching and bending)
surrounding the β positions. The charge distribution at the
TS is stabilized by EcDHFR-H2F interactions,
which also contribute to the increase in the force constant associated
with β H(D) atom motions. Since C6 of H2F must be
polarized for hydride transfer to occur, our results are in agreement
with a stepwise mechanism where protonation precedes hydride transfer.21,22,24,25,62 Because polarization of the N5–C6
double bond in H2F and the hyperconjugative effects play
a non-negligible role in the buildup of the TS of hydride transfer,
those elements cannot be ignored when DHFR is used as a model to answer
fundamental enzymology questions. Importantly, TS analysis has been
shown to be a powerful approach to the design of enzyme inhibitors,9,20 and information derived from the work reported here can be exploited
for the design of DHFR transition state analogues.
