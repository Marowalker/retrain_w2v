The water-splitting reaction provides
a promising mechanism to
store renewable energies in the form of hydrogen fuel. The oxidation
half-reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is a complex four-electron
process that constitutes an efficiency bottleneck in water splitting.
Here we report a highly active OER catalyst, cobalt vanadium oxide.
The catalyst is designed on the basis of a volcano plot of metal–OH
bond strength and activity. The catalyst can be synthesized by a facile
hydrothermal route. The most active pure-phase material (a-CoVOx) is X-ray amorphous and provides
a 10 mA cm–2 current density at an overpotential
of 347 mV in 1 M KOH electrolyte when immobilized on a flat substrate.
The synthetic method can also be applied to coat a high-surface-area
substrate such as nickel foam. On this three-dimensional substrate,
the a-CoVOx catalyst
is highly active, reaching 10 mA cm–2 at 254 mV
overpotential, with a Tafel slope of only 35 mV dec–1. This work demonstrates a-CoVOx as a promising electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution and validates
M–OH bond strength as a practical descriptor in OER catalysis.

1 Introduction
Water
splitting (2H2O → 2H2 + O2) is an attractive reaction to enable the storage of intermittent
renewable energies such as sunlight and wind, in the form of a chemical
fuel, namely, hydrogen.1 Water splitting
has a bottleneck that arises from its four-electron oxidative half-reaction,
the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), 2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e–. In order to accelerate
its sluggish kinetics and to achieve the production of hydrogen fuel
at a practicable rate, catalysts are necessary. State-of-the-art OER
catalysts, based on precious metals such as IrO2 and RuO2, can perform the OER in acidic solutions with an overpotential
close to 200 mV.2 However, the scarcity
and cost of those metals limit their potential for large-scale applications.
Developing earth-abundant OER catalysts is therefore crucial. A growing
number of catalysts based on earth-abundant transition-metal oxides
have been studied for OER in alkaline conditions, some of which are
reported to surpass IrO2 and RuO2 in activity.3−5

While the development of OER catalysts remains mostly empirical,
significant work has been done to search for theoretical guidelines
for catalyst discovery. The “descriptor” approach is
appealing because it allows systematic tuning of catalysts using a
single measurable or calculable parameter. Some of the most successful
descriptors for OER include the M–OH bond strength, the eg occupancy and (ΔGO* – ΔGHO*).6−8 Application of these descriptors in experimental work, however,
is limited.7,9

We recently measured the intrinsic
activity of a range of transition-metal
oxide thin film catalysts and found the activity correlated with the
M–OH bond strength proposed by Bockris and Otagawa in a volcano-type
plot (Figure 1).6,10 Typically, with the descriptor approach, the correlation reveals
neither the nature of the active species nor the physical origins
of the activity of mixed oxide catalysts such as NiFeOx and CoFeOx, which is
still under investigation and actively debated.11,12 However, it explains the superior activity of NiFeOx and CoFeOx in an approximate,
yet much simpler way, in that NiOx and
CoOx are on a different branch of the
volcano plot from FeOx, such that their
mixtures may benefit from a balance of M–OH bond strengths
to reach optimal activity. Given that the presence of iron is essential
in most highly active mixed metal oxide catalysts, we became interested
in developing iron-free catalysts to enrich the repertoire of OER
catalysts. Since VOx sits in the same
branch as FeOx in the volcano plot, we
turned our attention of V-containing mixed oxides. As an early transition
metal, V is rarely explored for OER with the exception of some recent
studies.13−15 For example, Sun et al. described the promising OER
activity of a NiV layered double hydroxide (LDH),14 and Wang and co-workers showed lepidocrocite VOOH as a
competent OER catalyst.15 According to
the volcano plot, we predicted that CoVOx might exhibit high OER activity since CoOx and VOx sit at the two opposite
branches. We thus prepared amorphous CoVOx catalysts via a simple hydrothermal method, and they indeed exhibit
excellent OER activity.

oxide (VOx) from ref (6).

2 Results and Discussion
In order to produce
a binary metal oxide made of cobalt and vanadium,
a hydrothermal synthesis was performed in a Teflon lined stainless
steel autoclave (see Experimental Section for
details). Control samples were also prepared by using the same hydrothermal
method with individual metal salts in order to obtain cobalt oxide
and vanadium oxide (CoOx and VOx). The powdered catalysts were immobilized on a glassy
carbon electrode, and cyclic voltammetry was performed in a 1 M KOH
electrolyte (pH 13.6). The OER activity is presented in Figure 2. Each oxide was tested in
normal KOH electrolyte, as well as in purified Fe-free KOH, where
trace iron was removed according to a procedure reported by Trotochaud
et al.12 The binary cobalt vanadium oxide
(named m-CoVOx in this
work due to its mixed-phase composition, vide infra) exhibits high
activity for water oxidation, reaching 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 366 and 358 mV in normal and Fe-free KOH,
respectively. This current density is taken as a reference as it is
the one expected at the anode in a 12.3% efficient solar water-splitting
device under 1-sun illumination.4 The control
samples made with the unary metal oxide constituents of this catalyst
(CoOx and VOx) required higher overpotentials for the same current densities.
It was found that the overpotentials for m-CoVOx do not differ noticeably whether a trace
amount of iron is present or not in the electrolyte. Thus, iron incorporation
seemed not to play an essential role in the OER activity of this material,
in contrast to NiOx.5,12,16 The Tafel slopes are 65 (63) mV dec–1 for m-CoVOx, 57 (59) mV dec–1 for CoOx, and 97 (142) mV dec–1 for VOx in normal 1 M KOH (with Fe-free KOH values in parentheses)
(Figure S1).

The composition and crystallinity of both control samples
(CoOx and VOx) and m-CoVOx were analyzed
by XRD
(Figure 3a). All three
samples show evidence of crystallinity. The m-CoVOx sample exhibits diffraction peaks similar
to those of the control CoOx sample (Figure S2a), and no crystalline cobalt vanadium
oxide phase could be identified in the XRD pattern of m-CoVOx. The diffraction peaks of the CoOx control sample correspond to a cobalt chloride
carbonate hydroxide hydrate phase (Co(CO3)0.35Cl0.2(OH)1.10·1.74 H2O, JSPDS
00-038-0547) (Figure S2b,c). Therefore,
the crystallinity of the m-CoVOx sample is presumed to come from this cobalt chloride carbonate
hydroxide hydrate phase, but not from crystalline cobalt vanadium
oxide. The vanadium oxide (VOx) control
sample was identified as the haggite phase (V2O2(OH)3, JSPDS 01-072-1228) (Figure S2d).

Figure 3 (a) XRD patterns of m-CoVOx, CoOx and VOx samples. (b) SEM images of m-CoVOx. The disorganized phase is highlighted in
blue and
the nanoneedles in red.

The morphology of the different metal oxides was analyzed
by SEM.
Two types of structures were observed in the m-CoVOx sample: the first is composed of nanoneedles,
while the second is a more disorganized phase (Figure 3b). The nanoneedles can be attributed to
the cobalt chloride carbonate hydroxide hydrate phase by comparison
to the SEM image of CoOx control sample
(Figure S3). TEM of the disorganized phase
reveals its polycrystalline nature and lattice fringes can be observed
on the HR-TEM image (Figure S4a). In the
STEM-EDX mapping, cobalt and vanadium are continuously observed as
a mixture, and the cobalt chloride carbonate hydroxide hydrate phase
could be identified as red particles on the Co–V map (Figure S4b). Thus, the m-CoVOx sample here is composed of a heterogeneous
mixture with a crystalline cobalt chloride carbonate hydroxide hydrate
phase and an X-ray amorphous phase containing cobalt and vanadium.

The hydrothermal method was further applied to grow the m-CoVOx sample directly on nickel
foam (NF). The deposited catalyst is also composed of a heterogeneous
mixed phase. Intricate nanoleaves and microscopic square crystals
can be observed by SEM (Figure S5). The
catalyst on nickel foam reached 10 mA cm–2 at overpotentials
of 293 and 298 mV in 1 M KOH and 1 M Fe-free KOH, respectively (Figure S6a). The stability of this catalyst was
evaluated by monitoring the potential at 10 mA cm–2. No significant changes were observed during 15 h of electrolysis
(Figure S6b), indicating good stability.

Because the m-CoVOx sample contains a crystalline Co oxide that was less active toward
OER (vide supra), we considered this Co phase as an impurity and concentrated
our efforts in synthesizing a pure single-phase cobalt vanadium oxide
catalyst in order to yield higher activity. This was successful using
the same hydrothermal method but with the addition of trisodium citrate
as an additive. Different ratios of cobalt and vanadium salts were
used in order to tune the composition of the oxide and optimize the
catalytic activity. Five different Co:V ratios were tried (Co:V mole
ratios in the hydrothermal solution: 5:1, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3 and 1:5),
and the obtained materials were evaluated for OER on a glassy carbon
electrode. All catalysts were scanned by cyclic voltammetry in 1 M
KOH and 1 M Fe-free KOH, although the presence of trace iron in the
KOH did not affect OER activity (Figure S7a). The Co:V ratio yielding the highest activity was 3:1 (Figure S7b).

The STEM images and EDX mapping
of the cobalt vanadium oxide with
a 3:1 Co:V ratio (Figure 4a) confirmed the formation of cobalt vanadium oxide phase.
Both Co and V are homogeneously dispersed throughout the sample, and
neither CoOx nor VOx particles were observed. The sample has a nanosheet-like morphology
(Figure 4b,c), and
the absence of diffraction peaks in its XRD pattern suggests it is
X-ray amorphous and that no crystalline CoOx or VOx impurities are present.
This confirms the formation of a pure-phase cobalt vanadium oxide
(Figure 4d), which
is labeled as a-CoVOx. When deposited on nickel foam, the a-CoVOx has a similar morphology and homogeneously
coats the three-dimensional substrate (Figure S8).

Figure 4 (a) STEM-EDX map of a-CoVOx. (b) TEM image of a-CoVOx. (c) SEM image of a-CoVOx. (d) XRD pattern of a-CoVOx.

The a-CoVOx catalyst
was further characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
(Figure 5). The binding
energy (BE) of the Co 2p3/2 signal is 781.1 eV. Moreover,
outer-shell excitation satellite peaks are visible at lower BE, indicating
high-spin Co2+.17 Vanadium is
incorporated into the catalyst in the +4 oxidation state, as suggested
by the V 2p3/2 peak at a BE of 516.5 eV.18 The signal at 288.3 eV in the C 1s region is representative
of carbon atoms in a carbonate group. The signal at a BE of 531.5
and 530.0 eV, in the O 1s region, is representative of oxygen atoms
in OH– groups and O2– in transition-metal
(oxy)hydroxides, respectively. The signal at BE = 532.3 eV, characteristic
of oxygen atoms in a carbonate group, further suggests the presence
of this group in the material.19 The atomic
ratio of cobalt to vanadium (Co:V) determined by XPS is approximately
75%/25% (3:1) and is consistent with the ratio of the two metal salts
in the precursor solution for the hydrothermal synthesis. However,
this agreement was somewhat fortuitous as there was otherwise a modest
discrepancy between the ratios of the metal salts used in the precursor
solutions and those of final catalysts for the other ratios used (Table S1).

(b) V 2p3/2 region, (c) O 1s region, and (d) C 1s region.

As we used a sodium salt (trisodium
citrate) as an additive to
synthesize the pure phase a-CoVOx, we investigated if sodium incorporation could influence the
OER activity of this material. We found that a-CoVOx does not contain sodium in its structure
after the hydrothermal synthesis (Figure S9a). We performed cyclic voltammetry in Fe-free NaOH in order to incorporate
sodium, and we determined that the OER activity of a-CoVOx did not increase in this electrolyte
compared to Fe-free KOH (Figure S9b).

The catalytic activity of a-CoVOx was measured on glassy carbon and nickel foam (Figure 6a,b). In the first case the a-CoVOx reached 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 347 and 351 mV in 1 M KOH
and 1 M Fe-free KOH electrolytes, with Tafel slopes of 51 and 49 mV
dec–1, respectively. When deposited on nickel foam
the catalysts delivered the same current density at an overpotential
of 254 and 262 mV in standard and iron-free 1 M KOH, with Tafel slopes
of 35 and 34 mV dec–1, respectively. The overpotential
for a-CoVOx compares
well with other cobalt vanadium oxide catalysts, such as Co2V2O7 (340 mV),20 Co3V2O8 (359 mV),21 and Co3V2O8 nanoroses
(391 mV).22 Additionally, a-CoVOx is highly competitive with other
cobalt-containing catalysts on nickel foam (NF), such as Co3O4/NF (497 mV),23 NiCo LDH/NF
(420 mV),24 NiCo DH/N-graphene/NF (350
mV),25 CoP/NF (290 mV),26 CoFeOx/NF and NiCoFeOx/NF (260 and 240 mV).10 In addition, the a-CoVOx immobilized on NF exhibited considerable catalytic durability and
stability, with only a moderate increase of 30 mV in overpotential
after 15 h of constant anodic polarization at 10 mA cm–2 (Figure 6c). After
the long-term stabilily test, the morphology and elemental composition
of a-CoVOx were investigated
by SEM and STEM-EDX. Structural degradation can be observed but the a-CoVOx catalyst retains its
nanosheet-like morphology (Figure S10a,b,c). The EDX mapping indicates that Co and V are still homogeneously
dispersed inside the material (Figure S10d), and no inclusion of nickel could be observed during the 15 h electrolysis
(Figure S10e) Furthermore, the faradaic
efficiency for OER was measured to be close to 100% (Figure S11).

Our group recently reported a volcano plot that compared
the mass
activity trends of different electrodeposited transition-metal (oxy)hydroxides
based on their respective M–OH bond strength.10 Even though the M–OH bond strength is not a definitive
descriptor of OER activity, Bockris and Otagawa proposed that this
parameter should allow the extraction of activity trends for metal
oxides.6,27 The bond strength D(M–OH) was defined
as the sum of the heterolytic Dion(M–OH) and homolytic
Dcov(M–OH) bond dissociation of a metal hydroxide
in the MIII(OH)3 form. For the determination
of D(M–OH) in our a-CoVOx, we simply treated them as a physical binary mixture and used
a linear combination of the bond strengths of the respective unary
metal hydroxides (Table S2). By taking
into consideration the mass activity of a-CoVOx with different Co:V atomic ratios (Figure S12, Table S3), we could correlate it
with their respective M–OH bond strength and a volcano-shaped
plot was obtained (Figure 7). The agreement between the theoretical lines and the experimental
data is surprisingly good given the simplifications made in the construction
of this plot. The optimal catalyst found experimentally, a-Co0.75V0.25Ox,
sits close to the top of the volcano.

3 Conclusions
On the basis of the volcano plot
of OER activity versus M–OH
bond strength, cobalt vanadium oxide was predicted to be a highly
active OER catalyst. A simple hydrothermal route was thus developed
to prepare the targeted compound. A pure-phase, amorphous cobaltvanadium
oxide (a-CoVOx) was obtained
and characterized by XRD, XPS, SEM, and STEM-EDX. This a-CoVOx catalyst showed high catalytic
activity for oxygen evolution. On a flat glassy carbon electrode,
the catalyst reached 10 mA cm–2 at an overpotential
of 347 mV in 1 M KOH electrolyte. When deposited on Ni foam, the a-CoVOx reached reached 10 mA
cm–2 at a 254 mV overpotential, making it among
the most active electrodes in alkaline conditions. The activity of
various a-CoVOx samples
with different Co:V ratios correlates with the M–OH bond strength
in a volcano-type plot. This work demonstrates the utility of a simple
descriptor (M–OH bond strength) for experimental developments
of OER catalysts, and advocates the further exploration of vanadium-containing oxides in OER.

4 Experimental
Section
All reagents were obtained from commercial sources
and used without
further purification. Millipore deionized water 18.2 MΩ·cm
was used to prepare all the solutions.

All the catalysts were
prepared by hydrothermal synthesis in Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclaves. For m-CoVOx, an aqueous solution containing 30 mM of cobalt(II)
chloride (CoCl2, anhydrous, > 98%, Fluka), 10 mM of
vanadium(III)
chloride (VCl3, anhydrous, 97%, Sigma), and 63 mM urea
(99%, ACS reagent) was loaded into the autoclave and heated at 150
°C for 14 h. The control samples (CoOx and VOx), based on only one of the two
metals, were prepared by the same procedure except only the desired
metal salt (CoCl2 or VCl3) was used with a concentration
of 40 mM to keep the total amount of metal cations constant. After
the hydrothermal step, the powders were separated by centrifugation
at 6000 rpm for 10 min and washed three times with a 50:50 mixture
of H2O and ethanol, with centrifugation between each washing
step. The powders were then collected and dried overnight under vacuum
at room temperature.

The amorphous pure-phase catalysts (a-CoVOx) were prepared following
a procedure similar
to the one described above. The only modifications were the addition
of 80 mM trisodium citrate (TSC, anhydrous, 98%, Acros), and purging
the solution with N2. a-CoVOx with different Co:V atomic ratios (a-CoyV1–yOx) were synthesized by tuning the ratio
of starting materials (CoCl2 and VCl3) while
keeping the total metal cation concentration at 40 mM.

The prepared
catalyst powders (5 mg) were each sonicated twice
for 30 min in a mixture of H2O (1 mL), iPrOH
(0.25 mL) and a Nafion solution (10 μL, 5 wt % in EtOH, DuPont)
in order to make an homogeneous suspension. Then, 2.5 μL of
this suspension was drop cast on a glassy carbon electrode (CH Instruments)
with a diameter of 3 mm and previously polished (with 0.05 μm
gamma alumina powder on a microcloth polishing pad, CH Instruments).
The drop was allowed to dry in ambient conditions for 30 min. The
catalyst loading was 140 μg cm–2 in all cases.

The catalysts were also synthesized on nickel foam (thickness 1.6
mm, porosity 95%, Goodfellow Cambridge Limited) by putting the nickel
foam substrate in the same solutions as for the hydrothermal synthesis
and heating at 150 °C for 14 h. The active area was delimited
by applying epoxy glue (SPI Supplies) on the nickel foam and carefully
pressing on it with a metal rod to make it fill all the pores in order
to prevent electrolyte from reaching the potentiostat clamp by capillary
action.

The OER activity and stability were measured by cyclic
voltammetry
and chronopotentiometry using a Metrohm Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat.
The third CV was taken as representative measurement for all samples
on glassy carbon and the tenth CV for the nickel foam substrates.
A three-electrode setup was used with either the glassy carbon electrode
or nickel foam substrate as working electrode, a platinum wire as
counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as reference electrode.
Stirring was performed only during the stability measurements. Standard
1 M KOH solution (pH 13.6, Merk) and NaOH solution (pH 13.6, Reactolab)
were used as received and/or further purified to remove trace iron
using a procedure reported by the Boettcher group.12

The uncompensated resistance for each sample was
measured by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in order to correct for the iR drop. The EIS data were collected at 1.20 V vs RHE and by applying
41 frequencies from 100 kHz to 1 Hz (10 mV amplitude). The resistance
was determined to be 0.6–0.8 Ω cm2 for the
samples on glassy carbon, and 1.0–1.4 Ω cm2 on nickel foam.

The faradaic efficiency was measured using
an airtight glass H-cell
with an optical fluorescence sensor (Ocean Optics). Quantification
was done for a-Co0.75V0.25Ox deposited on nickel foam. The cell was purged
with N2 to give an initial O2 content lower
than 0.5%. The measurement was done at 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M Fe-free KOH.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was
recorded on a PANalytical
Empyrean diffractometer with Bragg–Brentano geometry, equipped
with a PIXcel-1D detector. For the measurement, powders were mixed
with EtOH and drop-dried on glass slides. Data were analyzed with
PANanalytical X’Pert HighScore software. XPS analysis was carried
out using a PHI VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe with monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source of 24.8 W with a beam size of 100 μm.
The adventitious carbon 1s peak was calibrated at 284.8 eV and used
as an internal standard to compensate for charging effects. Data were
fitted by using PHI MultiPak software. SEM images were taken using
a Zeiss Merlin microscope operated at 2 kV and equipped with an Inlens
secondary electron detector. TEM images and STEM/EDX maps were recorded
using a FEI Technai Osiris TEM/STEM operated at 200 kV equipped with
a high-brightness XFEG gun and with a FEI Talos operated at 200 kV.
TEM samples were prepared by drop-drying either suspension of the
powders in EtOH onto carbon coated copper grids or a suspension made
by sonicating the nickel foam electrode for 30 min in EtOH to detached
catalyst particles from the NF surface
