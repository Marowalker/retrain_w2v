This report focuses
on a novel strategy for the preparation of
transition metal–MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters based
on a one-step, dual-target magnetron sputtering, and gas condensation
process demonstrated for Ni-MoS2. Aberration-corrected
STEM images coupled with EDX analysis confirms the presence of Ni
and MoS2 in the hybrid nanoclusters (average diameter =
5.0 nm, Mo:S ratio = 1:1.8 ± 0.1). The Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters
display a 100 mV shift in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) onset
potential and an almost 3-fold increase in exchange current density
compared with the undoped MoS2 nanoclusters, the latter
effect in agreement with reported DFT calculations. This activity
is only reached after air exposure of the Ni-MoS2 hybrid
nanoclusters, suggested by XPS measurements to originate from a Ni
dopant atoms oxidation state conversion from metallic to 2+ characteristic
of the NiO species active to the HER. Anodic stripping voltammetry
(ASV) experiments on the Ni-MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters confirm
the presence of Ni-doped edge sites and reveal distinctive electrochemical
features associated with both doped Mo-edge and doped S-edge sites
which correlate with both their thermodynamic stability and relative
abundance.

Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
have emerged as promising
materials for electrocatalytic applications. Initially used as hydrodesulfurisation
catalysts, the discovery of the linear dependence of the electrochemically
assisted hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the number of molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) edge sites1 has resulted in intensive research. In the case of MoS2, the focus is on maximizing the proportion of active edge sites
and minimizing the in-plane/through-plane charge transfer resistance
by the development of single-layered nanoplatelets,2 nanowires,3 mesoporous structures,4 and nanocomposites with highly conductive supports.5 Only the Mo-edge sites are active to HER due
to their near-zero hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGH = 0.06 eV).6

Several methods have been proposed to enhance the HER activity,
most of them concerning the sulfur enrichment of the Mo-edge sites.7,8 A promising alternative is the doping of the S-edge sites to activate
their HER activity.9 DFT calculations have
demonstrated that transition metal (TM) doping (Fe, Co, Ni) of the
S-edge sites shifts the ΔGH value
closer to ΔGH = 0 (thermo-neutral).
The weakening of the S-doping metal bond on the MoS2 edge
strengthens the H–S binding on the S-edge up to an optimal
level for catalyzing the HER.10 Experiments
on MoS2 nanoparticles and MoS3 thin films reported
an HER enhancement upon nonselective edge doping,11,12 and later tests on edge-terminated MoS2 nanofilms correlated
the 2-fold (in the case of Cu dopant) and almost 3-fold (for Fe, Co,
Ni) HER enhancement observed with the activation of the S-edge sites.13 Surprisingly, TM-doping on MoS2 nanoparticles
(NPs) is scarcely reported probably due to the difficulty in separating
the effects of surface area and morphology changes from the electrocatalytic
enhancement.14,15

Recently reported lamellar
MoS2 NPs, prepared by magnetron-sputtering
and gas condensation to create nanoclusters in the gas phase prior
to deposition, are excellent candidates for TM-doping due to their
narrow size-distribution and the present ability to control the stoichiometry
in the cluster beam source.16 Previous
investigations from our group demonstrated that magnetron-sputtered
MoS2 nanoclusters are amorphous and S-deficient (Mo:S ratio
= 1:1.6 ± 0.1).16 Xu et al. report
2H-MoS2 nanosheets fabricated by means of a gas-phase quartz
furnace method that yields crystalline and S-enriched MoS2 edges resulting in a significantly improved performance over naturally
occurring MoS2.17 Pumera et
al. observed a substantial increase in both HER overpotential and
Tafel slope in chalcogen-deficient TMDs,18 which can be ascribed in the case of MoS2 nanoclusters
to a deficiency of active sites and the formation of oxide species
MoO2/MoO3 at the S-deficient sites unstable
to cathodic potentials in acidic media.3

We report a novel methodology for preparing Ni-MoS2 NPs
via a one-step, dual-target, magnetron-sputtering, and gas condensation
deposition technique. Pristine MoS2 and Ni nanoclusters
as well as Ni-MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters are prepared to
evaluate their electrocatalytic activity to HER. (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters exhibit an almost 3-fold increase
in HER activity with respect to undoped (MoS2)300 nanoclusters, consistent with previous experimental studies on MoS2 thin films.13 Anodic stripping
voltammetry (ASV) experiments on aged (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters reveal four distinctive electro-oxidative peaks,
two of them correlated with the Ni-doped Mo-edge and S-edge sites
by their abundance ratio and thermodynamic stability.

Experimental
Methods
Dual-Target Magnetron Sputtering Deposition of Ni, MoS2, and Ni-MoS2 Nanoclusters
MoS2, Ni,
and hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters were prepared using a custom-built
cluster beam source at Teer Coatings Ltd. (Worcestershire, U.K.).
The system layout is shown in the Supporting Information
(SI), Figure S1, and a more detailed description is available
in the literature.19

During the cluster
deposition, a condensation length (i.e., the distance between sputtering
target surface and the exit nozzle) of 24 cm was used, and a pressure
of approximately 0.23 mbar was maintained in the condensation chamber,
with 70 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm) argon flow and
10 sccm helium flow. In the preparation of pure MoS2 or
Ni clusters, only the magnetron sputtering source fitted with the
respective target (MoS2 or Ni) was operated, whereas the
other magnetron’s power supply was switched off. For the deposition
of Ni-doped MoS2 clusters, the two magnetrons were operated
simultaneously.

Physical Characterization of Ni, MoS2, and Ni-MoS2 Nanoclusters
Clusters were
deposited on TEM grids
covered with amorphous carbon films for scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) characterization. The clusters were imaged with
a 200 kV aberration-corrected STEM (JEM 2100F) in the high-angle annular
dark-field (HAADF) mode, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDX) was also performed to analyze the elemental composition. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Kratos Axis His
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer fitted with a charge neutralizer
and magnetic focusing lense employing Mg Kα achromatic radiation
(1253.6 eV). Spectral fitting was performed using CasaXPS version
2.3.15 with spectra energy-corrected to the adventitious C 1s peak
at 284.6 eV.

Electrochemical Characterization
Electrochemical measurements
were carried out in a thermostated three-electrode electrochemical
cell (295 ± 2 K) with a PC-controlled PGSTAT128N potentiostat
(Metrohm Autolab B.V, Netherlands). The electrodes used were a saturated
calomel (SCE) reference electrode (BAS Inc., Japan), a bright Pt mesh
counter electrode (Alfa Aesar Ltd., U.K.), and 5 mm diameter, 3 mm
thick glassy carbon (GC) type 2 stubs (Alfa Aesar, U.K.) modified
with either pure Ni or Ni-doped/undoped MoS2 nanoclusters
as working electrodes.

Prior to modification, GC stubs were
polished to a mirror finish using decreasing size diamond (45 to 3
μm) and alumina slurries (1 to 0.05 μm) on a Buehler MetaServ
250 grinder-polisher using Trident/Microcloth polishing pads. The
modified GC stubs were electrically connected to a brass rod embedded
in Teflon (Direct Plastics Ltd., U.K.), insulating their lateral perimeter
with epoxy resin to ensure that only the nanocluster-modified cross-section
was exposed. All nanocluster-modified GC samples were transported
to the electrochemical cell in a sealed container under N2 atmosphere to avoid exposure to air.

All experiments were
performed in a 2 mM HClO4 (ACS
≥ 70%, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 M NaClO4 (ACS ≥
98%, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (pH 2.70), freshly prepared with ultrapure
water (resistivity not less than 18.2 MΩcm, Millipore Milli-Q
Direct 8). Deoxygenation was achieved by vigorous N2 bubbling
prior to each electrochemical experiment, and maintained under positive
N2 pressure. This electrolyte was chosen in contrast to
other electrolytes more commonly reported in the literature for hydrogen
evolution experiments (0.5 M H2SO4, pH ≈
0.3; 0.1 M HClO4, pH ≈ 1) due to the noncoordinating
nature of the perchlorate anion being likely to yield more reproducible
results and enable a more accurate elucidation of the reaction kinetic
parameters. All experimental glassware was cleaned overnight by soaking
in a dilute solution of KMnO4 (ACS ≥ 99%, Sigma-Aldrich)
in concentrated H2SO4 (>95% analytical grade,
Fisher Scientific), followed by thorough rinsing with ultrapure water.

The modified electrodes were preconditioned with 10 cycles between
−0.045 and −1.645 V vs SCE at a scan rate of 50 mVs–1. Electrocatalytic measurements were made at a range
of voltage scan rates from 2 to 1200 mVs–1. This
experimental procedure was applied to both freshly deposited and 14-h
air-exposed samples. An estimation of the surface coverage for (MoS2)300, Ni2200, and (Ni-MoS2)1000 was obtained with the hydrogen evolution experiments
by performing the least-squares linear regression of the HER peak
current intensity (|IP,HER|) vs the square
root of the scan rate (υ1/2) to fit the Randles–Sevčik
expression for irreversible redox processes (SI, Figure S5 and Table S1).

ASV experiments, consisting
of 10 cycles in the 0 to 1.2 V voltage
range versus SCE, were performed on both of the 14-h air-exposed electrochemically
tested MoS2 and Ni-doped MoS2 samples to estimate
their turnover frequency and elucidate their electrochemical features.
All voltammograms were later plotted with respect to the normal hydrogen
electrode (NHE).

Results and Discussion
Analysis of Magnetron Sputtering
Deposited Ni, MoS2, and Hybrid Ni-MoS2 Nanoclusters
The time-of-flight
mass filter enabled the mass of nanoclusters formed to be monitored
before deposition onto the GC stubs. Figure 1 shows the mass spectra of the samples employed
in the HER measurements. During the preparation of pure MoS2 samples, a sputtering power of 8W was applied to the MoS2 target and a peak mass of 4.8 × 104 amu, equivalent
to (MoS2)300, was found in the mass spectra
(300 being the number of MoS2 units contained in one MoS2 nanocluster). The pure Ni sample was prepared similarly,
and a resulting Ni peak mass of 1.3 × 105 amu, equivalent
to ∼ Ni2200, was found (2200 being the number of
Ni atoms in one Ni nanocluster). When the sputtering power for the
Ni target was changed from 4W to 8W, the peak mass shifted from 6
× 104 amu to 1.3 × 105 amu, and the
peak beam current shifted from 11 pA to 90 pA. Thus, higher sputtering
power on the Ni target generates more, and larger, Ni nanoclusters.
Consequently, a lower sputtering power of only 3W on the Ni target
was used in the preparation of the hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters
in order to avoid an excess of Ni nanoclusters, whereas 8W of sputtering
power was used on the MoS2 target. The peak mass of the
hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters was located at 1.6 × 105 amu, equivalent to a mass of (MoS2)1000 (1000 equiv MoS2 units per Ni-MoS2 nanocluster)
or Ni2712 (2712 equiv Ni atoms per Ni-MoS2 nanocluster).
In the following sections, we will refer to the Ni, MoS2, and hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters as Ni2200, (MoS2)300, and (Ni-MoS2)1000, respectively.

Figure 1 Mass spectra obtained by time-of-flight. From the spectra,
MoS2, Ni (8W), and Ni-MoS2 (3W) show peak masses
of
around 4.8 × 104 amu ((MoS2)300), 1.3 × 105 amu (∼Ni2200), and
1.6 × 105 amu {(MoS2)1000},
respectively. The mass spectra of Ni (4W) is also plotted to show
the effect of the power applied to this target.

The STEM images in Figure 2 show (top to bottom) the morphologies of MoS2 nanoclusters,
Ni-MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters, and Ni nanoclusters. An HAADF-STEM
image is a Z-contrast image, meaning that the image intensity depends
on the atomic number of elements,20 and
in practice, the images are dominated by Mo atoms. The distinct intensity
contrast across one MoS2 nanocluster indicates an incomplete
multilayer structure (the HAADF-STEM intensity line profile analysis
is shown in Figure S2 SI). Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters present a broadly similar morphology to that of the
pure MoS2 nanoclusters, whereas Ni nanoclusters show a
quite distinct crystalline structure. This implies that Ni is atomically
added to the MoS2 nanoclusters when the hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters are formed. After FFT analysis of STEM images
in Figure 2 and S2
(SI) and comparison with the crystalline
lattice parameters of MoS2 polymorphs 1T and 2H, no clear
crystalline structure could be found on either MoS2 or
Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters. Based on the projected surface areas
of tens of nanoclusters of each kind, the average diameter distributions
are shown in Figure 2. The peak values in the distributions for MoS2 nanoclusters,
Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters, and Ni nanoclusters are 2.6, 5.0,
and 4.2 nm, respectively.

based on the nanocluster
surface area. MoS2, Ni-MoS2, and Ni (8W) have
a peak value of 2.6, 5.0, and 4.2 nm, respectively.

In order to confirm the existence of Ni in the
hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters, EDX analysis was conducted,
and the result
is shown in Figure 3. Mo, S, and Ni signals are found in the same clusters, which indicate
Ni-MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters were made successfully. The
characteristic energy difference between the Mo L-edge and S L-edge
is only 14 eV, which is smaller than the energy resolution of the
EDX instrument (133 eV). Consequently, Mo and S signals cannot be
distinguished by EDX, and the cyan dots in Figure 3b are due to the signal overlap of Mo and
S. Ni signals are found both in MoS2 areas and between
them, which means Ni might locate on or between MoS2 nanoclusters. Figure 3c–e display
the individual elemental maps. Nanocluster shape mismatch between
HAADF-STEM images shown in Figure 3a and Figures 3b–e is ascribed to STEM image drift during EDX measurement.
Compared with the large nanoclusters, the small nanocluster located
at the bottom of each image is much less abundant in Ni, which is
found primarily at MoS2 edge sites and between nanoclusters.
Besides the signals found in the nanoclusters (marked by the yellow
shapes), signals can be found outside the nanoclusters; these signals
may come from small clusters originating from the deposition process
or electron beam sputtering of the deposited nanoclusters. Because
Mo and S signals are overlapped with each other, the exact nanocluster
compositions cannot be obtained from EDX analysis. To identify the
composition of the hybrid Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters, we employ
a method based on atom counting and STEM intensity measurement (SI). By this method, the compositions of six
nanoclusters of varying size were calculated and are listed in Table 1.The outcome is that
there is no fixed ratio of Ni atoms to MoS2 units in the
hybrid nanoclusters, but in general, the proportion of Ni increases
with nanocluster size, which agrees with the EDX results.

(a) containing large and small nanoclusters used for
EDX measurement. (b) EDX mapping shows the composition of Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters; Mo, S, and Ni are shown in green, blue, and
red, respectively. Signal in cyan comes from the overlap of Mo and
S signals. Mo, S, and Ni signals are also shown separately in pannels
c, d, and e, where the nanocluster positions are marked by the yellow
shapes.

The chemical composition and oxidation state of the
untested nanoclusters
deposited on TEM grids analyzed by STEM imaging were further characterized
by XPS. High-resolution spectra in the Mo 3d and S 2p region for fresh
and 14-h air-exposed (Ni-MoS2)1000 are shown
in Figure 4. The fresh
Mo 3d XPS spectrum can be deconvoluted into four components after
the inclusion of the photoemission current characteristic of the carbon
tape used to immobilized the TEM grids: one Mo 3d5/2 and
Mo 3d3/2 spin–orbit doublet found at ∼229.8
eV and ∼232.9 eV with binding energies consistent with the
binding energies found for the (MoS2)300 nanoclusters
(Figure S3 SI) and characteristic of the
Mo4+ oxidation state found in MoS2 materials,21 and an additional doublet at ∼233.1 eV
and ∼236.2 eV related to the Mo6+ oxidation state
found in MoO3.22 An upward shift
of 0.2 eV in the Mo4+ and Mo6+ components after
air exposure (for MoS2 nanoclusters ∼0.4 eV, see Figure S3 SI) as well as a photoemission intensity
increase of the latter doublet indicate an oxidation state increase
in both MoS2 and Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters. This
is supported by analysis of the Mo4+:Mo6+ XPS
atomic photoemission percentages (at. %), which reveal a conversion
of MoS2 into MoO3 from Ni-MoS2 fresh
samples (Mo4+/Mo6+ 78.1/21.9 at. %) to air exposed
(Mo4+/Mo6+ 54.9/45.1 at. %). The fresh S 2p
spectrum can be deconvoluted into two components at ∼160.7
eV and ∼161.9 eV, corresponding to the spin–orbit S
2p3/2:2p1/2 doublet characteristic of the S2– oxidation state,23 and
we observe that an additional broad signal at ∼167 eV related
to oxidized sulfur species such as sulfites or sulfates24 is also found on (MoS2)300 nanoclusters (Figure S3 SI). Quantification
of the Mo4+:S2– peak areas confirmed
the S-deficient nature of (MoS2)300 nanoclusters
(1:0.90 ± 0.02), while (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters
present a 1:1.8 ± 0.1 ratio similar to the Mo:S ratio expected
in MoS2 (1:2). Such difference in the oxidation behavior
could be ascribed to the presence of surface Ni atoms prone to oxidation,
which would mitigate S2– oxidation under ambient
conditions. The lack of definition in the spin–orbit S 2p3/2:2p1/2 doublet found here had been previously
ascribed in amorphous MoS3 materials to the presence of
mixed S2–/S22– oxidation
states,25 but in our case, it could be
due either to the low photoemission counts due to low sample loading
(∼4 μg cm–2) or to the inherent amorphous
nature of the MoS2 nanoclusters provided the S-deficiency
of the samples.

orange), S 2p3/2 (solid blue) and S 2p1/2 (dashed
blue).

Analysis of the Ni 2p high-resolution
spectra of both Ni and Ni-MoS2 nanoclusters is paramount
to evaluate the oxidation state
of the Ni dopant atoms as well as to identify the presence of nickel
species such as oxides and sulfides. Deconvolution of the Ni 2p3/2 component of the untested Ni nanoclusters (Figure S4 SI) shows the predominance of oxidized species
such as NiO and Ni(OH)2, with Ni:NiO:Ni(OH)2 composition percentages practically invariable after air exposure
(7.4:49.8:42.8 fresh, 6.6:51.2:42.2 air exposed). As for (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters (Figure 5), quantitative analysis of the Ni 2p region
is not possible due to low signal-noise ratio ascribed to the low
Ni content aimed during the nanocluster formation. The peak position
of the Ni 2p3/2 component for the fresh (Ni-MoS2)1000 samples at ∼852.8 eV and the lack of clearly
defined satellite signals seem to suggest predominance of metallic
Ni (theoretical value: 852.7 ± 0.4 eV),26 but air exposure leads to an upward shift of the Ni 2p3/2 component to ∼854 eV, similar to the 854.6 eV characteristic
of the NiO principal XPS peak27 as well
as in increase in the Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 satellite
intensities (∼861 and ∼872.5 eV, respectively). This
would indicate that under air exposure the doping Ni atoms spontaneously
increase their oxidation state to Ni2+ as found in NiO
species, agreeing with the behavior observed for bare Ni nanoclusters.
Presence of a nickel sulfide phase cannot be discarded from XPS results
as it is well reported that directly bonded S atoms leave the Ni 2p3/2 peak position unaltered,28 and
the S 2p3/2:2p1/2 doublet overlap commonly reported
in nickel sulfides29 is also found in the
bare (MoS2)300 nanoclusters. However, the upward
shift of the Ni 2p3/2 component to binding energies similar
to those of NiO species after air exposure makes the presence of a
nickel sulfide phase unlikely. Thus, the Ni oxidation state conversion
observed after 14 h air exposure will have significant repercussions
in the electrocatalytic performance of the Ni-MoS2 hybrid
nanoclusters.

Evaluation of Electrocatalytic Activity to Hydrogen Evolution
Reaction (HER)
Figure 6 shows the linear sweep voltammograms acquired in the 0 to
−1.2 V range (normalized vs NHE) at a scan rate of 25 mVs–1 in 2 mM HClO4/0.1 M NaClO4 aqueous
electrolyte for all samples tested. A diffusion decay peak profile
is observed in all samples due to the low proton concentration present
in the electrolyte ([H+] ≈ 2 × 10–6 mol cm–3), purposefully chosen to perform a better
elucidation of the samples’ kinetic parameters and surface
coverage (Tafel slope analysis and irreversible Randles–Sevčik
equation, see SI for the latter).

(MoS2)300 (solid green), and (e) 14-h air-exposed
(Ni-MoS2)1000 (solid orange) nanoclusters in
the 0 to −1.2 V range vs NHE. Scan rate: 25 mV s–1.

Freshly prepared (MoS2)300 nanoclusters (Figure 6a) exhibit an onset
potential of ca. 650 mV, reaching a peak half-maximum current density
(jhalf max) of 0.31 mA cm–2 at an overpotential (η) of ca. 770 mV. The experimental onset
potential is approximately 400 mV higher than that of 2H-MoS2 nanosheets reported in the literature (ca. 200 mV vs NHE):1,11,30 this originates from the MoS2 preparation methodology and hence the degree of sulfur enrichement.

The main factors that hinder HER activity in MoS2 materials
are their intrinsic conductivity, metal-to-chalcogen ratio, edge site
abundance, and catalyst loading. Previous investigations from our
research group demonstrated that magnetron-sputtered MoS2 size-selected nanoclusters presented a 2-layer thickness in the
150–500 unit range.16 This issue
has again been observed in this investigation, where (MoS2)300 nanoclusters exhibit an incomplete multilayered structure
ranging from 1 to 4 layers (see Figure S2 SI). As through-plane electron mobility in MoS2 is 2200
times slower than in-plane,31 the absence
of single-layered clusters hampers the electrocatalytic activity.
XPS analysis performed in this study have revealed that both (MoS2)300 and (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters
are S-deficient. A high correlation between metal-to-chalcogen ratio
and HER activity has been extensively reported. Eng et al. observed
a substantial increase in both HER overpotential and Tafel slope in
chalcogen-deficient TMDs,18 which can be
ascribed in the case of MoS2 to a deficiency of active
sites and the formation of oxide species MoO2/MoO3 at the S-deficient sites unstable to cathodic potentials in acidic
media,3 experimentally confirmed by XPS
measurements reported here.

Sulfur-rich MoS2 nanostructures
with enhanced HER activities
and stability in acidic environment have been prepared by use of gas-phase4 or liquid-phase32 methods.
However, evidence has shown that the morphology of MoS2 is modified by the exposure and composition of the sulfur gas phase33,34 or liquid phase.32 Thus, ex-situ sulfidation
treatments were not performed to guarantee that the HER enhancement
in the samples is unambiguously due to the Ni-doping of the edge sites.
In addition to this, reports by Vrubel et al. and Rowley-Neil et al.
revealed that the HER activity of the molybdenum sulfide catalysts
is correlated with the catalyst loading: higher molybdenum sulfide
catalyst loading lead to enhanced HER performance.35,36 Thus, the HER performance of our nanoclusters cannot be unambiguously
judged by the current density values obtained at the same overpotentials
as those reported by the literature. Assuming a cluster interspacing
of 2.5 nm, the mass loadings for Ni2200, (MoS2)300 and (Ni-MoS2)1000 are 1.28,
3.45, and 4.25 μg cm–2, respectively. These
values are at least 1 order of magnitude smaller than those reported
in more competitive MoS2 materials,4,37 supporting
our claims that the low catalyst loadings lead to overpotentials higher
than those reported in the literature.

Electrochemical testing
of the (MoS2)300 nanoclusters
after the aforementioned testing and exposure to air for 14 h indicates
an enhancement in their electrocatalytic performance to the HER, with
a jhalf max of ca. 0.40 mA cm–2 at η ≈ 749 mV. This is due to the dissolution
of the (MoS2)300 nanoclusters outermost layers
due to the conversion of MoS2 to MoO3, a compound
soluble in acidic conditions. Yu et al. observed that electrochemical
cycling of bilayered MoS2 nanoflakes assisted in the oxidation
of Mo4+ to Mo6+ ascribed to air exposure, leading
to the complete loss of the MoS2 outermost layer after
reimmersion in the acidic electrolyte used. The loss of such layer
resulted in enhanced HER performance and Tafel slope, concluding that
the loss of a full MoS2 monolayer increases the HER activity
by a factor of ∼4.47.38,39,40,41 As the (MoS2)300 nanoclusters have been shown
to consist of an incomplete multilayered structure (1 to 4 MoS2 layers thick, see Figure S2 SI), any loss of the outermost layers will consequently enhance the
HER activity.

Analogous voltammograms were recorded for (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters (Figure 6b). It can be seen that (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters exhibit a significant improvement
in the electrocatalytic activity with respect to the undoped counterparts:
the onset potential is reduced by ca. 100 mV and the jhalf max (0.35 mA cm–2) is reached
at η ≈ 680 mV (100 mV less than (MoS2)300 nanoclusters). To confirm that the HER enhancement is due
to the effective Ni-doping of the S-edge sites and not to the presence
of HER-active Ni nanoclusters in the sample, the response of a GC
sample modified with Ni nanoclusters (average atomic mass units= 2200, Figure 6c) was evaluated.
Ni2200 nanoclusters exhibited an onset potential and jhalf max similar to (MoS2)300 nanoclusters (0.36 mA cm–2, η ≈
770 mV) but with faster HER kinetics (as per Tafel analysis, vide
infra). This is evidenced by the fact that Ni2200 nanoclusters
achieve a peak current density (jp) of
0.72 mA cm–2 at η ≈ 870 mV whereas
(MoS2)300 nanoclusters only a jp = 0.63 mA cm–2 at η ≈
905 mV. Thus, we can satisfactorily conclude that the HER enhancement
observed in (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters is due
to the increase in active edge sites density upon Ni-doping of the
initially inactive S-edge sites.

Combined analysis of exchange
current density (j0) and turnover frequency
(TOF) values provides insight
on the predicted HER enhancement by Ni-doping as well as an indication
of the intrinsic activity per-site.9 Freshly
prepared (MoS2)300 and (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters presented similar j0 values (≈8 × 10–10 A cm–2), but after the above electrochemical experiments
and 14-h air exposure (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters
(Figure 6e) showed
an almost 3-fold increase with respect to their initial j0 value (2.1 × 10–9 vs 7.6 ×
10–10). This significant HER enhancement is in good
agreement with previous reports that indicated a 3-fold increase in
active sites but a worse per-site activity due to the overall less
thermo-neutral ΔGH values.13 TOF values of the 14-h air-exposed samples support
these conclusions: (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters
exhibit a lower TOF value (60.3 H2 s–1) than (MoS2)300 nanoclusters (67.1 H2 s–1) at equivalent overpotentials (calculation
performed at (MoS2)300 overpotential at jhalf max), indicating an inferior per-site
activity of the doped MoS2 nanoclusters despite the increase
in the density of edge sites. If TOF is calculated for (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters at their jhalf max overpotential, we obtain a value of 30.9 H2 s–1. All results are summarized in Table
S2 (SI).

Tafel slope analysis was
then carried out to provide insight on
the HER efficiency of the catalysts and on the HER reaction mechanism.
Noble metals such as Pt follow the Volmer–Tafel mechanism,
in which the rate-determining step is the chemical hydrogen desorption
from the catalyst surface, with Tafel slopes b ≈
30 mV dec–1.24 Tafel
slope analysis of the 25 mV s–1 cathodic scans (Figure 7) revealed that all
the MoS2 samples are in the 95–130 mV dec–1 range, (MoS2)300 exhibiting the lowest Tafel
slope (94 mV dec–1) after exposure to air for 14
h. This compares to exfoliated MoS2 layers reported to
display Tafel slopes, b ≈ 120 mV dec–1, in agreement with the Volmer mechanism which dictates the monatomic
hydrogen adsorption to be the limiting step.25 Edge-rich nanosheets26 and pure 1T-phase
MoS22 samples exhibited, respectively, b ≈ 55–60 mV dec–1 and b ≈ 40 mV dec–1.

Figure 7 Tafel plots (η
vs log|jgeom|)
of the Ni-doped/undoped MoS2 nanoclusters evaluated in Figure 6. Scan rate: 25 mV
s–1.

Electrodissolution of oxygen-rich HER inactive regions or
electrochemical
exfoliation of MoS2 outermost layers, previously reported
in the literature, might expose edge-abundant nanocluster regions
with higher through-plane conductivity that could explain (MoS2)300 lower Tafel slope after air exposure.27 Ni2200 samples present a Tafel slope
of 106 mV dec–1, similar to the b ≈ 120 mV dec–1 reported in the literature
for electrodeposited Ni thin films.28 When
as-prepared Ni-doped/undoped MoS2 nanoclusters are compared,
Ni-doping does not decrease the Tafel slope value significantly, leaving
the HER mechanism unchanged as reported previously.13

The HER enhancement of (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid
nanoclusters after 14 h air exposure is probably related to the Ni
surface: reports suggest this could comprise a spontaneously formed
NiO+Ni(OH)2 shell several atomic layers thick.42 Oxygen present in the NiO+Ni(OH)2 shell acts a proton-acceptor site, reported both theoretically and
experimentally to catalyze HER.43,44 The presence of NiO
after 14 h air exposure of (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid
nanoclusters has been confirmed by XPS measurements (see previous
analysis), which is also expected to be found in the samples tested
electrochemically. This effect would synergistically contribute to
the HER enhancement already observed for 14-h air-exposed (MoS2)300 related to dissolution of the MoS2 outermost layers.

Electrochemical Features of MoS2 and Ni-MoS2 Hybrid Nanoclusters: Anodic Stripping Voltammetry
Anodic
stripping voltammetry (ASV) experiments were performed on the 14-h
air-exposed samples to estimate numerically their turnover frequency
(see SI) and elucidate their electrochemical
features. Figure 8a
shows the voltammograms obtained for (MoS2)300 nanocluster-modified GC electrode. The two oxidation peaks at ca.
0.72 and 0.92 V versus NHE these correspond to the selective oxidation
of the MoS2 edge-plane sites (Mo- edges) and basal-plane
sites, respectively,11 by the irreversible
oxidation of Mo metal centers from oxidation state +4 to +6.25 The metastable edge sites require lower overpotentials
to drive their oxidation, whereas the thermodynamically favored basal-plane
sites necessitate higher overpotentials for their electrochemical
oxidation.45

(solid black) and (b) (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters
(solid red) deposited
on a 5 mm glassy carbon stub in the 0.5 to 1 V range versus NHE. Scan
rate: 50 mV s–1.

Next, analogous experiments were conducted on the (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters-modified GC electrode,
with
the results given in Figure 8b. In contrast to the undoped MoS2 nanoclusters,
the ASV presents a broad signal in the 0.4 to 0.8 V region on the
first anodic sweep, which is no longer present in further scans. Deconvolution
of the voltammetric profile reveals that the signal consists of four
oxidation peaks at ca. 0.48 V (peak I), 0.57 V (peak II), 0.65 V (peak
III), and 0.72 V (peak IV), respectively (for unconstrained peak deconvolution
see Figure S6 SI). The peak IV potential
is in agreement to the oxidation of undoped edge-plane sites experimentally
observed in (MoS2)300 nanoclusters.

The
absence of any other electrochemical features from bare MoS2 implies that the remaining anodic peaks are necessarily related
to oxidation processes at either bare Ni or Ni-doped MoS2 sites. Analysis of the Ni electro-oxidation reaction mechanism in
acidic media (SI) allows us to ascribe
peak I to the formation of the Ni(OH)2 anodic layer originated
from Ni nanoclusters/atoms not located at MoS2 active edge
sites (i.e., in MoS2 basal planes or in direct contact
with the GC electrode). Coverage of the basal-plane sites by Ni atoms/aggregates
is suspected to mask the inherent electrochemical activity of the
MoS2 basal planes, of which their electro-oxidative activity
is absent in the (Ni-MoS2)1000 ASV. Further
analysis of the integrated charge density ⟨σq⟩ of the ASV peaks supports this claim, as
the ⟨σq⟩ value for
peak I observed in the (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid
nanoclusters ASV (approximately 9.7 μC cm–2) is almost equivalent to that observed for the (MoS2)300 nanoclusters basal-plane ASV (⟨σq⟩ approximately 14.4 μC cm–2), indicating an almost entire coverage of the MoS2 basal
plane sites by Ni.

Ni doping, according to recent DFT calculations
of ΔGH values in MoS2 nanoclusters13 and experimental reports,
could effectively
dope both the already-active Mo-edge sites and the initially inactive
S-edge sites.15,46 This results in two active sites
per two MoS2 units at the S-edge and one active site per
two MoS2 units at the Mo-edge with a theoretical Mo-edge:S-edge
abundance ratio of 1:2. Activation of the thermodynamically favored
basal planes would have significant implications in the enhancement
of the electrocatalytic activity of TMDs, as all their surface would
be active to the HER. Recent reports have successfully achieved the
activation of the basal planes by incorporation of platinum in the
in-plane structure47 or the formation of
strained sulfur vacancies in 2H-MoS2.48 However, the possibility of Ni doping of the basal planes,
although briefly mentioned by Wang et al. as one of the main challenges
in transition metal doping,13 was not considered
in this study as no theoretical or experimental reports provide evidence
of MoS2 basal-plane activation after incorporation of transition
metals above the basal-plane surface.

Assuming a correlation
between the Mo-edge:S-edge natural abundance
and electro-oxidative activity ratios, we should expect, if the Ni-doped
sites have distinctive electro-oxidative features with respect to
pristine active sites, that unidentified peaks II and III satisfy
a 1:2 anodic peak ratio. Peak deconvolution of the anodic stripping
voltammogram, upon application of a 1:2 peak II/peak III area ratio
constraint, provides a satisfactory fit with R2 ≈ 0.990 (Figure 9). We therefore conclude that peaks II and III correspond
to the electro-oxidation of doped Mo-edge and S-edge sites, respectively.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that site-dependent
electrochemical features have been observed on TM-doped MoS2 materials.

Figure 9 Peak deconvolution of the anodic stripping voltammogram
(ASV) first
scan of 14-h air-exposed (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid
nanoclusters deposited on a 5 mm glassy carbon stub in the 0.4 to
0.8 V range vs NHE. Raw ASV (•) is deconvoluted in peaks I
(solid red), II (solid green), III (solid blue), and IV (solid brown).

The large difference in the undoped
edge plane sites peak intensity
between the (MoS2)300 and the (Ni-MoS2)1000 hybrid nanoclusters can be understood by analysis
of the integrated charge density of the electro-oxidative peaks found
in the ASV. We would expect that, due to the fact that Ni doping does
not occur selectively on the edge sites, some Mo-edge sites remain
undoped. As a consequence, the sum of the ASV response of the Ni doped
and Ni undoped Mo-edge sites in (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters should be (assuming equivalent catalyst loading and
surface coverage) equivalent to the ASV response of the undoped Mo-edge
sites present in (MoS2)300 nanoclusters.

The integrated charge density of the ASV peak at 0.72 V versus
NHE observed in (MoS2)300 ascribed to the Mo-edge
sites (⟨σq⟩ approximately
32.7 μC cm–2) is approximately equivalent
to the sum of the integrated charge densities of the ASV peaks II
and IV in (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters, ascribed
to the Ni-doped and Ni-undoped Mo-edge sites, respectively (Ni-doped
Mo-edge sites peak II: ⟨σq⟩ approximately 13.4 μC cm–2, undoped
Mo-edge sites peak IV: ⟨σq⟩ approximately 14.3 μC cm–2, total
charge density originated by Mo-edge sites: ⟨σq⟩ approximately 27.7 μC cm–2). Differences observed are correlated with variations in the nanoclusters
loading as well as peak integration.

Peak III in (Ni-MoS2)1000 nanoclusters, ascribed
in this manuscript as the electro-oxidative feature of the Ni-doped
S-edge sites, was initially electrocatalytically inert and thus contributed
to the ASV basal plane peak acquired for the (MoS2)300 nanoclusters.

The possibility of one of the peaks
being due to the oxidation
of a nickel sulfide species formed by interaction of Ni and MoS2 nanoclusters can be easily discarded by the peak positions:
this process occurs at potentials ca. −0.05 V, out of our electrochemical
window.49

This peak identification
also provides some insight on the thermodynamic
stability of Ni-doped Mo-edge and S-edge sites. Analogous to nondoped
MoS2 nanoclusters, the lower oxidation potential of peak
II with respect to peak III would imply that the Ni-doped Mo-edge
sites are more thermodynamically unstable than the Ni-doped S-edge
sites. Kibsgaard et al. observed that M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu) doped-MoS2 nanoparticles prepared by physical vapor deposition exhibited,
in terms of (1̅010) S-edge and (101̅0) Mo-edge relative
free energies, stabilized S-edge sites in MoS2 with respect
to Mo-edge sites, in agreement with the peak position order experimentally
observed in the ASV.14

Conclusions
Ni-MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters have been successfully fabricated
by dual target magnetron sputtering and gas condensation deposition,
obtaining a unimodal size distribution with an average cluster size
of 1000 equiv MoS2 subunits. EDX mapping on the AC-STEM
images confirm that the resulting nanoclusters are a hybrid of Ni
and MoS2 rather than their segregated components. The activity
of Ni-MoS2 hybrid nanoclusters is on par with previous
reports of electrocatalytic enhancement to HER: an almost 3-fold increase
in exchange current densities along with a significant shift in the
onset potential (approximately 100 mV), as well as an almost unaffected
Tafel slope (≈ 120 mVdec–1). This activity
is only achieved when nanoclusters are exposed to atmospheric environment,
suggesting that only when Ni dopant atoms/aggregates oxidize will
the Ni-doped edge sites become fully HER active, which is supported
by XPS measurements. Anodic stripping voltammetry experiments revealed
that HER-active undoped and doped edge sites are electrochemically
distinguishable according to their thermodynamic stability, following
the order Ni-doped Mo-edge< Ni-doped S-edge< pristine Mo-edge.
The successful electrochemical identification of S-edge doping and
its subsequent correlation with the HER enhancement confirm the capability
of dual target magnetron sputtering and gas condensation deposition
technique for the preparation of TM-doped TMDs. Finally, anodic stripping
voltammetry is a powerful technique for probing TM-doped TMDs and
tailoring doping parameters.
