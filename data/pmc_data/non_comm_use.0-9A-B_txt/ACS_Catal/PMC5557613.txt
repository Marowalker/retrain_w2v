The
performance of zeolites as solid acid catalysts is strongly
influenced by the accessibility of active sites. However, synthetic
zeolites typically grow as complex aggregates of small nanocrystallites
rather than perfect single crystals. The structural complexity must
therefore play a decisive role in zeolite catalyst applicability.
Traditional tools for the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts
are unable to directly relate nanometer-scale structural properties
to the corresponding catalytic performance. In this work, an innovative
correlative super-resolution fluorescence and scanning electron microscope
is applied, and the appropriate analysis procedures are developed
to investigate the effect of small-port H-mordenite (H-MOR) morphology
on the catalytic performance, along with the effects of extensive
acid leaching. These correlative measurements revealed catalytic activity
at the interface between intergrown H-MOR crystallites that was assumed
inaccessible, without compromising the shape selective properties.
Furthermore, it was found that extensive acid leaching led to an etching
of the originally accessible microporous structure, rather than the
formation of an extended mesoporous structure. The associated transition
of small-port to large-port H-MOR therefore did not render the full
catalyst particle functional for catalysis. The applied characterization
technique allows a straightforward investigation of the zeolite structure–activity
relationship beyond the single-particle level. We conclude that such
information will ultimately lead to an accurate understanding of the
relationship between the bulk scale catalyst behavior and the nanoscale
structural features, enabling a rationalization of catalyst design.

Introduction
Zeolites are widely
used as solid acid catalysts in both laboratory-scale
research and industrial chemical processes.1−3 Their catalytic
activity and chemoselectivity are strongly influenced by the accessibility
of individual active sites that are located within the characteristic
ordered microporous structure.4 Structural
imperfections such as defects and meso- and macropores are therefore
believed to be key determinants of catalyst performance.5,6 This is specifically true for zeolites with unidirectional pore
systems, such as mordenites (MOR). The MOR framework consists of 12-
and 8-membered ring channels running along the crystallographic c axis and a network of side pockets oriented along the b axis that are not effectively interconnecting the pores
along the c axis.7 Since
molecular transport of most organic molecules can only occur through
the 7.0 Å × 6.5 Å sized 12-membered ring (12MR) channels,
the MOR framework porosity can be regarded as unidirectional. As a
consequence, molecular diffusion is easily obstructed, and as-synthesized
mordenite crystals therefore often display restricted mass transport.8 According to the literature, this so-called small-port
(SP) behavior is most probably caused by crystallographic stacking
faults or extra-framework aluminum species deposited in the micropores.7,9−11 The obstructed molecular accessibility in the micropores
of such small-port mordenites (SP-MORs) limits the catalytic activity
to pore entrances located near the outer surface of the crystals.8 These mass transport constraints are typically
circumvented by applying postsynthetic dealumination, such as acid
leaching or hydrothermal treatments, to introduce mesopores into the
structure.

In this work, a newly developed integrated fluorescence
and electron
microscope (iFlEM) is applied to investigate the effect of SP-MOR
nanocrystallite structure on the catalytic performance. The novelty
of this research is 2-fold. First, we describe the development of
a new tool that for the first time enables catalyst structure to be
linked to its performance on the nanoscale. The main advantages of
using such an integrated instrument instead of independent microscopes
are the strongly reduced risk of sample contamination and that, after
an initial alignment of the system, structural images and catalytic
activity maps are conveniently overlaid. The second novelty is that,
in contrast to idealized, micrometer-large crystals, which have been
used before, this work employed a commonly applied industrial zeolite
batch, containing a large amount of complex intergrown particles.

The latter is of importance since most synthetic zeolite batches,
including mordenites, do not consist of perfect uniform crystals,
but rather a wide range of particle morphologies is present. It often
follows that zeolite particles exhibit complex intergrowths and obvious
structural defects.11,12 The influence of this structural
complexity on the catalytic performance or postsynthetic dealumination
is not yet understood at the relevant length scales, mainly because
traditional analytical methods used in zeolite and catalysis research
are unable to directly link the effects of structural imperfections
to the impact on the catalytic performance.4,5,12,13 Particularly
for zeolites with a one-dimensional porous structure, pore blocking
has a tremendous effect on catalyst performance, but this has so far
not been directly related to the local catalyst structure.14 For example, electron microscopy enables the
investigation of structural details down to the atomic scale.15 However, a direct correlation of this structurally
resolved information to the catalytic performance, which is typically
measured on the bulk scale, cannot be made due to the intrinsically
large inter- and intraparticle heterogeneity. At best, the outcome
of ensemble averaged catalyst testing can lead to generalized insights
on the interplay between catalyst structure and activity.

Fluorescence
microscopy has undeniably proven its ability to characterize
and visualize the catalytic performance down to the level of individual
catalytic conversions.16,17 More specifically, the optical
transparency of zeolites enables the catalytic performance to be mapped
out on the nanoscale through Nanometer Accuracy by Stochastic Chemical
reActions, or NASCA.18−20 The interpretation of these spatially resolved performance
maps depends on morphological features that can typically be resolved
from corresponding optical transmission images of the same catalyst
particle. This approach is therefore limited to micrometer-sized crystals
with well recognizable morphologies and structures. For example, fluorescence
microscopy investigations have led to the elucidation of the impact
of intergrowth structures within large H-ZSM-5 crystals on pore accessibility,
chemical mobility, and catalytic performance.19,21,22 Alternatively, a number of uniform nanometer-sized
metal catalyst particles has been investigated.8,23−25 These spatially resolved studies have so far demonstrated
the impact of inter- and intraparticle heterogeneities on the overall
catalytic performance.26 Together, these
investigations only focused on either large, perfect crystals or relatively
small particles that are assumed to be uniform in size and morphology.
However, this is not representative for actual industrially employed
catalyst powders containing nonuniform nanoparticles and complex aggregates
of nanocrystallites. Therefore, it is essential to correlate the nanoscale
activity maps recorded by NASCA microscopy to structural information
on the same particle on the same length scale.16

Detailed structure–activity relationships
at the level of
individual zeolite catalyst particles were recently obtained by the
Weckhuysen group by combining transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
with diffraction-limited confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.27,28 While very powerful, these static experiments are focused on investigating
prestained samples and do not enable super-resolution imaging of the
catalytic activity on the nanoscale. Furthermore, care has to be taken
not to compromise the local catalyst structure during the sample slicing
prior to the experiment. Chen and co-workers alternatively employed
correlative fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) to link catalytic activity to the structure of metal nanoparticles.24,29,30

This brief summary of earlier
efforts to investigate the catalyst
structure–activity relationship down to the nanoscale illustrates
the relevance of developing an iFlEM approach as applied in the reported
work. By linking nanoscale catalyst performance and structure, we
uncover the significance of crystal intergrowths that induce extra-framework
porosity and their role on catalyst performance before and after acid
leaching. Furthermore, it was discovered that there is no significant
mesopore creation through extensive acid leaching, demonstrating the
need for an additional hydrothermal treatment in order to truly circumvent
the small-port behavior of MOR zeolites.

Experimental Methods
Integrated
Fluorescence and Electron Microscope
The
iFlEM setup consists of an inverted epifluorescence wide-field microscope
integrated into an SEM (FEI Quanta 250 FEG), by means of a customized
chamber door (SECOM, Delmic BV; Figure 1).31,32 On the outside of the sample
chamber, a 532 nm diode pump solid state laser (Omicron laserage)
is directed through the chamber window by means of a 442/532 nm dichroic
mirror with accompanying excitation filter (Figure 1b). A 100 × 1.4 NA CFI plan APO VC oil
objective lens (Nikon) located inside the vacuum chamber provides
the wide field excitation of the sample. As such, this system provides
1.9 kW cm–2 of excitation light on the sample. To
operate the system under vacuum conditions (approximately 1 ×
10–4 Pa), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate is
applied as immersion liquid. The generated fluorescence is guided
through the optically transparent window and passes through the dichroic
mirror and a 542 nm LP emission filter, followed by a 2.5× camera
lens in front of the EMCCD camera (Hamamatsu C9100-23B). The optically
transparent chamber window is key to the functioning of the integrated
system as it allows fluorescence and excitation light to travel through
the chamber door. Hence, after venting the system, catalytic activity
mapping can be started immediately. The described configuration provides
a 32.8 × 32.8 μm2 field of view and a 64 ×
64 nm2 pixel size on the investigated sample. Wide-field
fluorescence movies were acquired with 30 ms exposure time. The linear
polarized light experiments are performed after introducing a Glan-Thompson
polarizer (Thorlabs) into the optical pathway before the dichroic
mirror. A detailed schematic representation of the iFlEM is provided
in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1).

(Delmic B.V.). Both subimages also show an inside view of the electron
beam/sample/objective lens configuration in the situation that (a)
a structural image is being acquired with SEM and (b) the single turnover
precise catalytic activity map is obtained after bringing the sample
to atmospheric pressure, attaching a perfusion chamber to the cover
slide, and adding the reagent solution.

Sample Preparation
The SP-MOR sample was obtained from
Tosoh Corporation (HSZ-620HOA, Si/Al ratio: 7.5). Two droplets of
a 10 mg/mL mordenite in Milli Q water suspension were spin-coated
onto single-molecule clean cover slides at 3000 rpm for 60 s. These
single-molecule clean 22 × 22 #1 cover slides were prepared by
calcination for over 24 h in a static air oven at 450 °C, followed
by a 1 h ozone treatment in a UV reactor (Ultraviolet products, PR-100).
The spin-coated samples were additionally calcined in a static air
oven at 450 °C to remove any impurities that could lead to residual
fluorescence in the zeolite sample. To ensure that no structural changes
were induced in the sample, a stepwise heating scheme was used (heating
ramp of 1 °C/min and a 1 h dwell time at 80 and 150 °C;
at 450 °C the temperature was held for at least 48 h).

Correlated
Data Acquisition
The correlated NASCA experiments
were always performed in a similar fashion. The prepared cover slide
was attached onto a metal plate sample holder and mounted into the
iFlEM. SEM images of the crystals were taken (2 kV, SE, high vacuum
mode; Figure 1a), after
which the sample chamber of the SEM was vented to atmospheric pressure
and the chamber door was opened (Figure 1b). Next, a perfusion chamber (PC8R-1.0-CoverWell,
Grace Bio laboratories) was attached onto the cover slide, and 50
μL of an 18 wt % FFA (Sigma-Aldrich, 98%, purified through vacuum
distillation prior to use) solution in Milli Q water was added with
a micropipette. Through a set of experiments with varying concentrations,
this amount was established as the optimal concentration. The addition
of FFA as the fluorogenic reagent leads to the formation of oligomeric
reaction products, by means of the acid-catalyzed condensation reaction
that is catalyzed on the Brønsted acid sites of the zeolite (Scheme S2).17 These
oligomers are composed of a conjugated backbone structure that provides
the fluorescent properties to enable their observation in fluorescence
experiments with single-molecule sensitivity.19 In the NASCA experiment conducted on the acid leached sample, a
reduced 8 wt % FFA in Milli Q water solution was added to ensure the
single-molecule sensitivity for this catalytically more active sample.
For our experiments, only crystals that show little or no background
fluorescence were used.

NASCA Analysis
By fitting the point
spread function
of single emitters with a two-dimensional Gaussian function, their
exact location is determined. The localizer software used to perform
this analysis on the recorded fluorescence movies and produce the
quantitative activity maps is available online (https://bitbucket.org/pdedecker/localizer) as a plugin for both Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) and Matlab (MathWorks).33 The resolution achieved by this approach is
approximately 20 nm.19 Single fluorescent
product molecules reappearing in consecutive frames before photobleaching
were counted as one catalytic event. The software has a built-in consolidation
functionality that finds reappearing molecules within a certain distance,
allowing a certain blinking time. For these specific experiments,
a respective distance of 50 nm and blinking time of 90 ms were employed.
All the parameters mentioned above were obtained after a careful evaluation
of different combinations of the different parameters. The quantitative
NASCA images that result from this analysis are obtained by binning
the data into 50 × 50 nm2 areas. By additionally considering
the imaging depth as a measure for the thickness of every voxel, i.e.,
500 nm, the corresponding catalytic activity is obtained, which is
represented by assigning a color scale to the resulting activity map.

The Overlay Procedure
The correlated micrographs shown
in Figures 2, 3, and 4 were created using
the image registration tool available in ImageJ. By selecting the
same two reference points on both the qualitative activity map (produced
using the localizer software) and the electron micrograph, the correct
magnification, rotation and translation is obtained that is needed
to accurately overlay both images. By merging the resized qualitative
activity map and the electron micrograph with the merge channels command,
the correlated micrograph is obtained. The cyan colored dots displayed
on the SEM micrographs in this work represent the position where at
least one turnover has taken place.

Molecular Size Calculation
The molecular diameters
of FFA and pyridine were calculated using MarvinSketch (version 15.9.21.0),
developed by ChemAxon.

Reaction-Pore Confinement Analysis
The Matlab analysis
procedure that has been developed to perform the reaction-pore confinement
analysis is available online (https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByLzCpEAweEkbTdHQllxeUlzRkE). In this analysis, the NASCA image data obtained from analyzing
the respective linear polarized light experiments, using the localizer
software and binning them into 200 × 200 nm2 zones,
are used as input. The two separate data sets are carefully screened
for drift using a built-in drift check function. The reaction-pore
confinement plot in Figure 3e has been drift corrected for +64 nm along the y axis. No drift correction was needed to obtain the reaction-pore
confinement plot of the HNO3 leached sample. A second parameter
is set as the lower limit (LL). As such, any bins in the image only
composed of fluorescent background molecules are filtered out. The
LL for the analysis of the performed experiments is set to five turnovers.
Finally, an upper threshold is set for the transparency range that
qualitatively displays the number of turnovers detected within the
respective bins. The threshold is set at 10% of the maximal bin value
obtained by summing the turnovers of both linear polarized light experiments
in every bin.

Acid Leaching
Dealumination has
been achieved by refluxing
1 g of the SP-MOR zeolite sample at 90 °C for 8 h using 20 mL
of a 1 M HNO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 65%) in Milli Q solution
while vigorously stirring the slurry. The acid leached zeolite was
separated from the acidic solution by means of Büchner-filtration
using warm distilled water until the permeate obtained a neutral pH.
Finally, the zeolite was dried in a static air oven for 24 h at 85
°C.

Bulk Scale Characterization
Elemental analysis of the
HNO3 leached sample has been performed using ICP-OES (Varian
720-ES). N2-adsorption isotherms have been obtained at
−196 °C (Micromeritics 3Flex 3400 physisorption instrument).
The reference and HNO3 treated samples have been degassed
prior to the experiment for 4 h at 250 °C under vacuum conditions
(1 Pa). The specific surface area has been obtained by BET analysis. 27Al spectra were acquired on a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer,
spinning the sample at 10 kHz at the magic angle. The spectra were
recorded using a one pulse sequence with π/12 pulses of 2.90
μs using a recycle delay of 0.8 s and referenced to a solution
of 0.5 M Al(NO3)3 dissolved in 0.5 M HNO3. Each spectrum was acquired with 1024 scans using a spectral
width of 19 607 Hz recorded with a 2048 point FID size and
processed with a 5 Hz apodization.

Bulk Scale Reactivity Testing
The bulk scale naphthalene
isopropylation reaction was performed in the liquid phase using a
high-pressure 15 mL TOP reactor for 8 h at 200 °C and under 2
× 106 Pa of N2 gas (99.999%). A figure
of the apparatus was added to the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The reaction mixture consisted of 1.84 mmol of naphthalene
(Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%), 4 mmol of 2-propanol (Biosolve ≥99.8%),
9 mL of cyclohexane (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥ 99.8%), and 100 mg of
the MOR catalyst. The catalyst powder is used as provided by the manufacturer
or as obtained after acid leaching, i.e., crystal size 1–3
μm and average particle size 18 μm. After 8 h of reaction,
the reactor was cooled by placing it in an ice bath. The reaction
mixture was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, CP-Sil 8,
FID detector) in split injection mode (split ratio 20) using N2 carrier gas. After injection, the temperature was programmed
as follows: 5 min hold at 40 °C, heating to 280 °C at 4
°C/min, and finally a 10 min holding time. A total of 2 mmol
of n-tetradecane (TCI, ≥ 99%) was added as an internal standard
for quantitative gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Identification
of the compounds was carried out using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry.

Pyridine Staining
Prior to pyridine
adsorption, the
mordenite sample is dropcasted and calcined as described in the sample
preparation paragraph. After calcination, the cover slides, which
are contained in glass vials, are cooled down to approximately 280
°C. At this point, two droplets of pyridine (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥
99%) are pipetted onto the bottom of the vial, the glass vial is closed
using its lid, and the sample is left for several hours for the adsorption
to take place.

Raman Experiments
The Raman experiments
were performed
using a Zeiss 100× 1.3 NA oil immersion objective lens and a
Coherent argon-ion gas laser, tuned to operate at 488 nm. This resulted
in a spot size of approximately 460 nm and a spatial resolution of
approximately 230 nm, used to probe intergrown particles at discrete
locations. The microprobe power density used was 15 kW cm–2, which is well below the damage threshold limit. The relative amount
of pyridine adsorbed at the different positions in the different samples
is quantified by determining the ratio of the pyridine to mordenite
band intensity from the Raman spectra.

Results and Discussion
When the iFlEM approach is used, detailed electron micrographs
of the H-MOR catalyst particle at study are collected from the top
of the sample and linked to catalytic activity maps of the same catalyst
particle obtained from the bottom side of the sample (Figure 1). The latter is achieved by
measuring single catalytic turnovers using the fluorescence microscope
after addition of an aqueous furfuryl alcohol (FFA) solution. Localization
and accumulation of the individual fluorescent reaction products results
in nanoscale activity maps.17,19Figure 2a shows a typical scanning electron micrograph
of an intergrown crystal in an industrial H-MOR batch, which mainly
contains aggregated SP-MOR crystals. The corresponding schematic representation
is presented in Figure 2b. The different MOR crystals that make up the aggregate are pseudocolored
as a guide for the eye and to simplify the later discussion. Here,
the small blue H-MOR crystal protrudes from the larger orange crystal,
and on the opposite side a large defect is present. Judging from the
shape of the defect, it likely results from another intergrown crystallite
that has broken off. After this detailed morphological characterization,
FFA was added to the SP-MOR cluster, enabling the visualization of
single acid-catalyzed turnovers by recording the fluorescent FFA oligomer
formation. The individual fluorescent reaction products were subsequently
localized with nanometer precision and their locations (cyan dots)
overlaid with the high-resolution SEM image, as shown in Figure 2c. Since the optical
focus was centered around the middle of the aggregate, the recorded
catalytic events originate from an optical slice around the center
of the aggregate of approximately 500 nm thickness (Scheme S1). This is also apparent from the location of the
recorded catalytic events with respect to the scanning electron micrograph.

The majority of the observed catalytic events are clustered in
a zone about 300 nm wide, delineating the outer surface of the aggregated
particle. This is indicative of small port behavior as the size of
the FFA reagent molecule should enable diffusion through the 12MR
channels (molecular diameter is about 6.1 Å), and earlier research
on MFI type zeolites with a characteristic 10MR microporous structure
has additionally revealed full accessibility.8,17,34 Importantly, experiments in this work are
performed shortly after the addition of FFA, and during this period
the catalytic activity remains constant. The observed small-port behavior
is therefore assumed to be an effect of mass transport limitations
rather than pore blocking, which might gradually occur by accumulation
of oligomers. In the latter case, the catalytic activity would decrease
during the experiment. Second, varying numbers of turnovers are observed
within the active zone. The small port behavior becomes even clearer
when looking at the NASCA image obtained in Figure 2d by binning the measured catalytic turnovers
into 50 × 50 nm2 zones, which yields a quantitative
view on the matter. In the main crystal (orange), most of the acid-catalyzed
oligomerization reactions are limited to two opposite crystal facets.
On the basis of the crystallographic structure, in combination with
the morphology of the crystals, these slightly curved and roughened
facets are identified as the crystallographic (001) facets where the
12MR pores are surfacing.8,35 This observation shows
that catalytic conversions in SP-MOR are limited to the acid sites
available in the first few hundred nanometers behind the 12MR pore
mouths. At the other facets, the microporous zeolite framework, and,
hence, the catalytically active sites, are not accessible toward the
FFA substrate. Note that the sparse turnovers detected at these facets
can be related to acid sites at the outer surface or minute crystal
imperfections. Surprisingly, also a significant number of catalytic
turnovers is observed away from the outer surface and inside the main
crystal, in the zone underneath the intergrown crystal at the top.
The width of this catalytically active zone is comparable to that
at the (001) facets at the crystal exterior. Judging from the shape
of this catalytically active area, it can be assigned to the interface
between the intergrown crystals, i.e., the highly defective area between
the blue and orange crystals. Note that the activity of this region
is similar to that observed at the readily accessible (001) facets
and that no activity gradient is observed from the outside of the
crystal toward the most deeply buried part of the intergrowth. It
can therefore be concluded that the extra-framework porosity at this
interface is sufficient to allow reagent molecules to readily reach
the active sites along the intergrowth.

Figure 2e and f
display the scanning electron micrograph and optical transmission
image of another SP-MOR aggregate in this industrial H-MOR batch.
A direct comparison clearly demonstrates that the structural complexity
of small particles in typical zeolite samples cannot be captured by
diffraction limited optical imaging. From the scanning electron micrograph,
the structural details of this aggregate can be resolved, with the
corresponding schematic representation shown in Figure 2g. The crystal at the top part (green) is
a nearly complete crystal with an obvious defect at the top. Again,
from the shape of the defect, it seems to have resulted from a broken
off intergrown crystallite. Judging from the morphology of the particle
(vide supra), the 12MR micropores run perpendicular
to the rough (001) top facet along the optical z axis.
In the center of the aggregate, another large crystal (orange) is
present, perpendicular to the top (green) crystal. The 12MR pores
in this crystal run parallel to the imaging plane, connecting the
curved (001) facets where two more protruding crystals (red and blue)
are present. The slightly different orientation of these two protruding
crystals suggests that both are independent of each other.

Similar
to the first aggregate (Figures 2a–d), the catalytic reactivity of
this particle was measured by adding the fluorogenic FFA reagent solution
and subsequently localizing the individual catalytic turnovers. Figure 2h shows the positions
of localized individual catalytic events overlaid with the corresponding
electron micrograph. The corresponding NASCA image is shown in Figure 2i. The interface
of the central crystal (orange) with the intergrown crystals (red
and blue) results in a highly active x-shaped zone of activity. Additionally,
significant catalytic activity is observed at the interface between
the central (orange) and top (green) crystals. The width of the catalytically
active zones, measuring about 300 nm, and the absence of an activity
gradient within this zone is in line with earlier observations on
the first aggregate. The absence of catalytic activity in the upper
(green) crystal can be explained
by the orientation of the crystal; the 12MR micropores run parallel
to the propagation direction of the excitation light (optical z axis). As the fluorescent product molecules are spatially
constrained within the microporous structure, the molecules will be
aligned along the micropore orientation. This results in a minimal
overlap between the electric field vector of the excitation light
and the transition dipole moment of the fluorescent product molecules.8,36

Clearly, the absence of a perfect coalignment between the
crystal
lattices of the intergrown crystals results in a local discontinuity
of the zeolite framework at the boundary between these SP-MOR crystals.
The resulting extra-framework porosity facilitates molecular diffusion
and leads to an enhanced molecular accessibility. As such, this results
in a zone of high catalytic activity at the interface between the
individual crystallites, away from the outer surface. The catalytic
activity at these intergrowths accounts for respectively 28 and 67%
of the total catalytic activity observed in the two examples. These
data clearly underline the importance of intergrowths on the overall
performance of these H-MOR zeolites. At the same time, these results,
showing activity away from the outer surface, also indicate that an
aluminum gradient cannot be the origin of the observed activity profile,
i.e., active crystallite edges and inactive crystallite center. On
the other hand, it cannot be deduced from these observations whether
this catalytic activity is only linked to acid sites within the SP-MOR
micropores or if some portion of the activity is linked to defect
sites at the highly defected interface. This is important, since the
latter would have a negative impact on the shape selectivity.37,38 Whereas product molecules formed within the confinement of the microporous
structure are expected to be aligned along the 12MR pore direction,
molecules formed on active sites directly located on the highly accessible
intergrowth boundary should not show any preferential orientation.8,36 Hence, the orientation of the fluorescent product molecules with
respect to the one-dimensional porous structure is a good indicator
of the pore confinement, which is crucial for shape selectivity. The
orientation of fluorescent reaction products can be straightforwardly
visualized by implementing linear polarized excitation light.36

To quantitatively investigate the pore
confinement of individual
fluorescent reaction products, an aggregate of three intergrown crystals
from the same SP-MOR batch was examined in Figure 3. In this cluster, the 12MR pores of the respective crystals
are oriented almost perpendicular to each other. The aggregate itself
was oriented in such a way that the 12MR pores of the individual crystals
are along the optical x, y, and z axes. When excitation with circular polarized light is
performed (Figure 3a), fluorescent oligomers oriented in the xy plane
are detected. A schematic representation of the cluster in which the
different axes are assigned is given in Figure 3b. As observed in Figure 2c and h, catalytic activity is limited to
zones of about 300 nm thickness starting from the 12MR pore mouths
at the (001) facets and around the intergrowth interfaces. Note that
the catalytically active zone along the interface between the middle
(green) and left (orange) crystals is broader than the previously
observed 300 nm (Figure 2c and h). As the catalytic activity map is a 2D projection of single
turnovers taking place within a 500-nm-thick optical slice (vide supra), the width of the projection will depend on
the relative orientation of the intergrowth structure to the optical
section. Clearly, this interface does not follow any of the crystallographic
axes of the other two intergrown crystals.

The introduction
of a Glan–Thompson polarizer into the excitation
pathway of the iFlEM polarizes the excitation light and allows its
rotation over 360° in the optical xy plane.
Next, we quantitatively investigate the polarization dependence by
specifically employing two perpendicular polarization directions:
first along the optical x axis, parallel to the 12MR
pores of the orange crystal (Figure 3c), and, second, along the optical y axis, parallel to the 12MR pores in the blue crystal (Figure 3d). This investigation reveals
that the formed fluorescent product molecules at the (001) facets
of the respective crystals are mostly confined to their respective
12MR pores. When the excitation polarization is oriented along the
direction of the 12MR pores of the orange crystal (i.e., the optical x axis), the number of catalytic turnovers observed in the
blue crystal reduces drastically compared to the situation in which
circular polarization was employed. Even though the catalytic reaction
still occurs, the fluorescent product molecules are no longer efficiently
excited, as the polarization direction of the excitation light is
perpendicular to the orientation of the molecular excitation transition
dipole moment. On the other hand, the opposite effect is observed
when the polarization plane is oriented parallel to the optical y axis (Figure 3d). In this case, the blue crystal exhibits the majority of
the catalytic activity, and only a fraction remains excitable and
detectable in the orange crystal. Surprisingly, the same observation
holds for the fluorescent product molecules formed at the intergrowth
regions of the two crystals with the middle green crystal. As the
12MR pores of the latter crystal are oriented along the optical z axis, no significant contribution to the catalytic activity
map is expected from the molecules confined within the microporous
structure. Therefore, this is direct proof of the pore-confinement
of reaction products near crystalline defects such as intergrowth
interfaces.

Combining the information from Figure 3c and d into one reaction-pore
confinement
plot shows the local orientation of product molecules with respect
to the 12MR pores: red-to-green and blue-to-green color scales are
indicative of a transition from a situation in which all fluorescent
product molecules are confined within the 12MR pores in the orange
and blue crystals, respectively, to a situation where there is no
preferential orientation (green; Figure 3e). The color intensity of each pixel provides
a qualitative indication of the relative number of turnovers occurring
in this zone. The reaction-pore confinement plot resulting from the
aggregate in Figure 3 mainly shows red and blue zones, corresponding to a confinement
of approximately 86% over the whole particle. This value is obtained
by determining the ratio of the number of fluorescent product molecules
oriented along the local microporous structure, to the total number
of catalytic turnovers observed over the catalyst particle. As such,
this number represents the shape selectivity of the individual catalyst
particle based on the FFA probe reaction.

The reaction-pore
confinement determined during this experiment
reveals that active sites are predominantly confined within the microporous
structure as reaction products are preferentially oriented along the
one-dimensional 12MR pores. However, catalytic activity is observed
on all intergrowth structures, regardless of the crystallographic
facets that are included. The formation of the crystallographic surface
is therefore assumed to be incomplete where intergrowth formation
has taken place. This leads to an opening up of the microporous structure.
Additionally, active sites accessible through intergrowth structures
are as reactive as those accessible through the intrinsic pore mouths
on the (001) facets. This is an indication that mass transport inside
intergrowths is unrestricted. As such, intergrowth structures are
regarded as microporous voids that facilitate mass transport toward
catalytically active sites located within the opened up crystallographic
framework.

One method commonly applied to enhance molecular
transport in SP-MOR
catalysts is acid leaching, removing both framework and extra-framework
aluminum species hindering molecular transport along the 12MR pores.
Already in 1983, Raatz et al. reported that selective leaching of
about 20% of the total aluminum content converts SP-MOR into the large-port
form.10 Since then, such postsynthetic
treatments have become routine practice in H-MOR catalytic research.39 The sample under investigation in this study
was submitted to acid leaching by refluxing the SP-MOR zeolite sample
in a HNO3 solution.40 Typically,
the effect of this procedure on the zeolite and its catalytic performance
is investigated by means of bulk-scale analysis, such as atomic spectroscopy
to determine the bulk Si/Al ratio, or solid state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) to discriminate between framework (AlIV) and extra-framework aluminum (AlVI). Here, bulk analysis
using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES)
revealed that about 30% of the aluminum was removed from the zeolite
sample, and 27Al NMR data additionally showed a slight
preference toward extra-framework AlVI removal. N2-physisorption revealed a small increase in micropore- and external
surface area. Finally, also a bulk scale naphthalene isopropylation
reaction was performed on the mordenite catalysts. As such, the reactivity
trends and shape selectivity properties, observed at the single particle
level, before and after acid leaching, could be validated using an
industrially relevant bulk scale process. The naphthalene isopropylation
reaction revealed an increased activity from <1% conversion to
8% after HNO3 leaching, indicating that the SP-MOR sample
indeed became more active toward the alkylation of bulky organic molecules
after the acid treatment. A summary of these bulk scale experiments
can be consulted in the Supporting Information.

A combination of the newly developed iFlEM approach with
the analysis
tools introduced above provides a novel way to investigate the effects
of acid leaching beyond the bulk scale. Figure 4 reveals the reaction-pore
confinement for an HNO3 treated aggregate consisting of
three orthogonally intergrown crystals. The orange crystal is oriented
with its 12MR pores running along the optical y axis,
and the 12MR pores in the green crystal run parallel to the optical z axis. Additionally, a smaller crystallite (blue) is intergrown
with the green crystal.

The correlated micrograph and quantitative
activity map in Figure 4a and c show that
the catalytic activity in the acid leached particle still predominantly
resides at the edges of the orange crystal and the intergrowth, between
the orange and green crystals. Furthermore, there is a zone of moderate
catalytic activity in the green crystal which is attributed to the
small intergrown blue crystal. As it is located beneath the green
crystal, both the morphology of this crystal and the exact orientation
of the intergrowth remain unresolved by means of SEM imaging. However,
based on the information obtained from the reaction-pore confinement
plot (Figure 4d), it
is fair to assume that the orientation of the blue crystal is similar
to that of the larger orange crystal. Note that the fluorogenic reagent
concentration was reduced because of the increased reactivity over
the untreated H-MOR sample (Figure S7).
This increased reactivity is in line with the results from the bulk
scale naphthalene isopropylation reaction. Additionally, the reaction-pore
confinement plot in Figure 4d only reveals a slightly reduced molecular confinement of
83%. These results further confirm the earlier assumption that the
formation of intercrystalline intergrowths led to locally enhanced
access to the microporous structure. The effect of the acid treatment
would otherwise be much more effective if intergrowths existed of
combined micro-, meso-, and macroporous regions.

The presented
nanoscale structure–activity experiments are
a representative subset of a larger number of experiments (n = 10) and reveal that the location of the catalytic activity
in H-MOR zeolites is not dramatically influenced by typical acid leaching.
In earlier research, Liu et al. demonstrated that severe dealumination,
removing more than 50% of the framework aluminum, was necessary to
render the full catalyst particles accessible.8 In their work, dealumination was achieved by means of a combined
hydrothermal and acid treatment. Where acid leaching mainly enhances
the local reactivity by etching the easily accessible microporous
structure, the hydrothermal treatment introduces extensive meso- and
macoporous defects that render the full catalyst particle accessible.

Intergrowth structures are affected to the same extent as the intrinsically
active edges of the crystals, despite the former being much more defected.
Even though over 30% of the aluminum has been removed, the H-MOR still
displayed the typical reaction distribution and shape selective properties
associated with small-port behavior, and therefore no transition from
small-port to large-port H-MOR seemed to have taken place. Small-
or large-port behavior is typically revealed by performing static
benzene uptake experiments;9,10 pyridine adsorption
has been investigated using Raman spectroscopy to mimic such static
experiments and confirms our findings based on the FFA oligomerization
reaction. This approach involves the investigation of pyridine uptake
before and after acid leaching in targeted areas of an intergrown
particle: the crystallite edge, center, and on the interparticle intergrowth.
The results are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S8 and Table S4).

The pyridine uptake experiments
indeed show an opening up of the
microporous network and thus a transition of small-port to large-port
H-MOR, even though pyridine is a bulkier molecule than the FFA reagent
(molecular diameter for pyridine is about 6.7 Å). This significantly
increased pyridine uptake in all three selected areas of the acid
leached particle seems to contradict the outcome of the NASCA experiments.
The discrepancy between both experiments can be explained by the dynamic
aspect of the NASCA experiments in which molecular transport also
plays a significant role. On the contrary, the pyridine distribution
is determined after reaching equilibrium. Hence, we believe that the
fluorogenic reaction gives a more accurate picture of the catalytically
relevant domains. Alternatively, the presented observations could
be interpreted as being an effect of Al zoning; however, this effect
has not been reported for the MOR sample.8

Conclusions
In conclusion, the catalytic performance of
acid zeolite nanocrystallites
was studied by linking the catalytic performance, as observed in super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy, to structural features of the same crystallite
recorded by scanning electron microscopy. This enabled, for the first
time, a direct observation of the effect of defects and intergrowths,
commonly present in powdered zeolite batches, on the overall performance.
First, intercrystalline intergrowth structures in SP-MOR aggregates
were demonstrated to have a major contribution to the overall activity.
The molecular confinement plots revealed that reaction products at
the defect-rich intergrowth boundary preferentially align with the
12MR pores rather than taking random orientations. Hence, catalytically
active sites at intergrowths are mainly located within the microporous
structure. The intergrowth structure is therefore identified as a
void space that allows unrestricted mass transport, enabling reactions
to occur in the adjacent micropores. Second, dealumination by acid
leaching mainly affects the intergrowths and the crystal edges. Surprisingly,
even though more than 30% of aluminum was removed, and pyridine adsorption
experiments showed a transition from small-port to large-port H-MOR,
the reactivity pattern was not altered. Furthermore, a similar reaction-pore-confinement
is observed on the crystal edges and intergrowths, before and after
acid leaching, indicating the importance of such intergrowths for
the overall catalyst performance. This is relevant information with
the aim of rationalizing catalyst synthesis. Full catalytic utilization
of the zeolite material on the other hand requires more severe postsynthetic
treatments, e.g., more extensive acid leaching or a combination with
hydrothermal treatment.8,36,41 Future research should focus on the role of intercrystalline intergrowth
structures with respect to catalyst coking and mesopore creation through
hydrothermal treatment. Additionally, this line of research would
benefit from the development of an in situ liquid
cell that enables truly integrated experiments, allowing the fluorogenic
reaction to be conducted within the vacuum of the SEM chamber.
