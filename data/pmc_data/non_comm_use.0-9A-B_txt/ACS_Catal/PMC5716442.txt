The
mechanism of CO hydrogenation to CH4 at 260 °C
on a cobalt catalyst is investigated using steady-state isotopic transient
kinetic analysis (SSITKA) and backward and forward chemical transient
kinetic analysis (CTKA). The dependence of CHx residence time is determined by 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 SSITKA as a function of the
CO and H2 partial pressure and shows that the CH4 formation rate is mainly controlled by CHx hydrogenation rather than CO dissociation. Backward CO/H2 → H2 CTKA emphasizes the importance of
H coverage on the slow CHx hydrogenation
step. The H coverage strongly depends on the CO coverage, which is
directly related to CO partial pressure. Combining SSITKA and backward
CTKA allows determining that the amount of additional CH4 obtained during CTKA is nearly equal to the amount of CO adsorbed
to the cobalt surface. Thus, under the given conditions overall barrier
for CO hydrogenation to CH4 under methanation condition
is lower than the CO adsorption energy. Forward CTKA measurements
reveal that O hydrogenation to H2O is also a relatively
slow step compared to CO dissociation. The combined transient kinetic
data are used to fit an explicit microkinetic model for the methanation
reaction. The mechanism involving direct CO dissociation represents
the data better than a mechanism in which H-assisted CO dissociation
is assumed. Microkinetics simulations based on the fitted parameters
confirms that under methanation conditions the overall CO consumption
rate is mainly controlled by C hydrogenation and to a smaller degree
by O hydrogenation and CO dissociation. These simulations are also
used to explore the influence of CO and H2 partial pressure
on possible rate-controlling steps.

1 Introduction
Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis is a heterogeneously catalyzed
reaction whereby synthesis gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen)
is converted into liquid fuels and chemicals.1−3 Known since
the seminal works of Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch in the 1920s,4,5 the Fischer–Tropsch (FT) reaction has led to large-scale
industrial applications to upgrade carbonaceous feedstock such as
coal and natural gas into more valuable liquid products. Supported
cobalt is the preferred catalyst for the FT reaction due to its high
activity, high chain-growth probability, low water–gas shift
activity, and moderate deactivation.6 A
key challenge of FT technology in practice is to combine high yield
of long-chain hydrocarbons with low methane selectivity. Even for
methane, the simplest hydrocarbon product of the FT reaction, the
exact reaction mechanism has not been resolved yet. Mechanisms proposed
for the FT reaction are often based on postulated rate-determining
steps leading to Langmuir–Hinshelwood equations7 or have been developed using empiric rate equations.8 Some of these models for the FT reaction are
very sophisticated in their ability to describe important kinetic
parameters such as CO consumption rate,9 chain-growth probability,10 and other
aspects such as olefin readsorption and hydrogenation.11,12 Nevertheless, given the complexity of the FT reaction—the
large number of involved reactants, products and reaction intermediates,
and the uncertainty about the reaction mechanism—there is a
great need to investigate this important reaction in more detail.

Detailed insight into reaction mechanism, specifically into the
way particular elementary reaction steps control reaction rate and
selectivity, can be obtained by transient experiments. Transient techniques
involving isotopes were developed by Happel,13−15 Bennett16,17 and Biloen.18−20 Steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis
(SSITKA) allows extracting kinetic information under steady-state
conditions. The unique feature of SSITKA is that the chemical composition
of the surface is not changed by the abrupt replacement of one reactant
by its isotope.21 Using this technique
surface coverages and kinetic rate constants of rate-controlling steps
can be determined unperturbed by changes in surface coverage. This
sets SSITKA apart from chemical transient kinetic analysis techniques.
Reviews of the SSITKA methodology are given by Shannon and Goodwin22 and Ledesma et al.23

SSITKA has already been used before to investigate the mechanism
of FT catalysts.24−27 The majority of these studies focused on methanation,28−34 because the involved molecules are small enough to be traced online
by mass spectrometry and also because the reaction network leading
to methane can be formulated robustly in terms of elementary reaction
steps. Regarding cobalt-catalyzed FT synthesis, it is usually assumed
that CO dissociation is the rate-determining step based on the observation
that the reaction order with respect to CO is negative. Matsumoto17 and Biloen18 made
early attempts to understand the FT mechanism by transient kinetics.
Another important work by Winslow and Bell combined isotopic transient
kinetic analysis with in situ infrared spectroscopy to investigate
the FT mechanism for supported ruthenium.35 Winslow and Bell showed the existence of two different carbon species,
one being a reactive surface intermediate and the other one involved
in deactivation. These two pools of carbidic carbon have also been
observed by others such as Happel et al. for nickel15 and van Dijk et al. for cobalt36 albeit that, different from the work of Winslow and Bell, all of
the species could be hydrogenated to methane. Van Dijk et al. reported
that C hydrogenation is the slow step in the mechanism of CO hydrogenation
to methane by supported cobalt.24,36 More recently, Yang
et al. attributed the H2 partial pressure dependence of
the methanation reaction to the H-assisted nature of CO dissociation.30 Den Breejen et al.31 and Yang et al.32 interpreted the cobalt
particle size effect in terms of strongly bonded C and O atoms on
small cobalt particles on the basis of SSITKA data. SSITKA investigations
of promoter effects of rhenium and zinc on cobalt were reported by
Yang et al.33 and Enger et al.,34 respectively. Recent progresses in understanding
the FT mechanism by SSITKA has been reviewed by Qi et al.37

An important related aspect of the FT
mechanism in this regard
is the mode of CO dissociation. With the advent of density functional
theory, the sensitivity of dissociation of molecules like CO,38−42 NO,43 and N244,45 to the topology of metal surfaces that enclose catalytic nanoparticles
has been extensively investigated. Accordingly, it has been realized
that direct CO dissociation is highly likely on step-edge sites,39−42 because the terrace sites, which dominate the surface of sufficiently
large nanoparticles,46,47 are not reactive enough. Another
view is that CO activation takes place on terrace sites through an
H-assisted mechanism.30,48−52 Although it is difficult to disprove an H-assisted
CO dissociation mechanism on a surface that contains adsorbed CO and
H, we have recently demonstrated by isotopic exchange of a 12C16O/13C18O mixture that CO dissociation
is fast and reversible on an empty cobalt surface.53

The purpose of the present work is to provide new
mechanistic insight
into the CO methanation reaction based on direct CO dissociation employing
transient kinetic techniques. We discuss an interpretation of the
H2 pressure dependence of the methanation reaction that
is different from H-assisted CO dissociation. We employ two different
types of transients, a SSITKA switch involving a change in the isotopic
labeling of the feed, (12CO/H2/Ar → 13CO/H2/Ne), and forward and backward CTKA transients
involving Ne → CO/H2, Ne/H2 →
CO/H2 and CO/H2 → Ne/H2 switches.
The coverage dependence of the kinetic parameters extracted from these
transient measurements was evaluated by varying the CO and H2 pressures. The obtained steady-state and transient data are modeled
using the two CO dissociation mechanisms. The direct CO dissociation
model that describes the data better is then used to carry out microkinetics
simulations to identify the elementary reaction steps that control
the CO consumption rate. An important corollary of this study will
be that CO dissociation is not the rate-controlling step under methanation
conditions at 260 °C. Instead, hydrogenation of O and especially
of C atoms deriving from CO dissociation are identified as the slow
steps. The consequences of applying different conditions (H2/CO ratios and partial pressures) on surface composition and major
rate-controlling steps will be discussed.

2 Experimental
Section
Preparation and Basic Characterization
A silica-supported
Co catalyst promoted by Pt was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation
of SiO2 (Shell, sieve fraction 120–250 μm,
136 m2/g determined by BET) with an aqueous solution of
Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck, 99.99%)
and Pt(NH3)4·(NO3)2 (Alfa Aesar, 99.995%). Pt was added as a reduction promoter. The
impregnated silica was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcined
at 350 °C in static air for 2 h after heating to this temperature
at a rate of 1 °C min–1. The catalyst contained
17.1 wt % Co and 0.04 wt % Pt as determined by ICP-OES analysis (Spectroblue,
AMETEK, Inc.). Co dispersion was measured by H2-chemisorption
(ASAP 2010, Micromeritics), which was carried out at 110 °C after
reduction at 450 °C (heating rate 1 °C min–1) for 6 h and evacuation at 470 °C for 3 h. Taking into account
the degree of reduction as measured by TPR (ASAP 2920 II, Micromeritics),
the particle size determined by extrapolating the straight-line portion
of the adsorption isotherm to zero pressure was 19 nm. From TEM imaging
(FEI Tecnai 20, LaB6, 200 kV), a volume-averaged particle size54,55 of 15 nm was determined. The Co crystallite size determined by in
situ XRD (D/max-2600, Rigaku) of the reduced catalyst by use of the
Scherrer equation was 14.7 nm.

Catalytic Activity Measurements
Catalytic activity
measurements were performed in a setup that is capable of transient
experiments. Two identical gas-feeding units were connected to a four-way
valve, which allows rapidly switching between the two feed flows.
Great care was taken to keep flow perturbations minimal during switching.
This was done by imposing similar pressure drop over the system between
the two flow lines and the use of properly regulated mass flow controllers.
A low dead-volume stainless-steel tubular reactor of 5 mm inner diameter
and 80 mm bed length was used. The catalytic activity in steady state
was determined by online gas chromatography (VARIAN CP-3800 equipped
with TCD and FID).

Typically, 20 mg of sample diluted with SiC
was loaded in the stainless-steel reactor. Prior to reaction, the
sample was in situ reduced in a diluted H2 flow (10% H2 in Ar, 50 mL min–1 in total) at 450 °C
using a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 and atmospheric
pressure for 16 h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to 260 °C
in an Ar flow and the pressure was increased to 1.5 bar. Thereafter,
the feed was switched to a flow containing a mixture of 12CO, H2, and Ar for 16 h to obtain steady-state conversion
of the synthesis gas feed.

Transient Kinetic Experiments
Three
types of transient
kinetic analyses were performed, i.e., forward and backward chemical
transient kinetic analysis (CTKA)21,56−58 involving a change in the chemical composition of the gas phase
(forward transient involving Ne → CO/H2 or Ne/H2 → CO/H2; backward transient involving CO/H2 → Ne/H2) and a steady-state isotopic transient
kinetic analysis (SSITKA) involving a change in the isotopic labeling
of the feed (12CO/H2/Ar → 13CO/H2/Ne). In CTKA experiments, the Ne flow was used as
balance to keep the total flow rate unchanged after switch. In SSITKA,
the Ne was used as tracer to determine the gas-phase hold-up of the
reactor. In all the experiments, an additional Ar flow was used as
balance to keep H2 partial pressure and total flow rate
at 50 mL min–1 when the CO/H2 ratio was
varied. The concentrations of H2 (m/z = 2), H2O (m/z = 18), 12CO (m/z =
28), 13CO (m/z = 29), 12CH4 (m/z = 15), 13CH4 (m/z = 17),
Ne (m/z = 22), and Ar (m/z = 40) were monitored by an online quadrupole
mass spectrometer (GeneSys).

The CO residence time (τ)
was calculated via the area under the normalized transient curves NCO(t), and corrected for the gas phase hold-up
with the use of the Ne inert tracer. 1  

The CHx (surface intermediates leading
to methane) residence time was first determined in a similar way as
CO, but corrected for the chromatographic effect of CO by subtracting
half of the CO residence time.18 2  

The number of reversibly adsorbed CO and adsorbed CHx species can be determined from the residence time
and exit flow of the corresponding species. Taking into account the
dispersion (the value derived from H2-chemisorption), the
surface coverage of CO and CHx can be
calculated. 3   4  where FCO refers
to the CO feed rate, ACo is the number
of accessible Co surface atoms determined by H2-chemisorption,
and XCO and SCH4 are CO conversion and CH4 selectivity, respectively.

3 Results and Discussion
Steady-State Kinetic Measurements
We first investigated
the steady-state kinetics of the Co/SiO2 catalyst at a
temperature of 260 °C in order to determine reaction orders with
respect to CO and H2. The dependences of the reaction rates
(expressed as turnover frequency, TOF) of CO consumption, CH4 formation, C2+ formation, CO2 formation and
the chain-growth probability on CO and H2 partial pressures
are presented in Figure 1. The CO and H2 partial pressures were varied between
15 and 150 mbar and 270–1350 mbar, respectively. At 260 °C,
the main product of CO hydrogenation is CH4. Under such
methanation conditions, the chain-growth probability is low. Apparent
reaction orders with respect to CO and H2 are listed in Table 1. In line with literature,30 the methanation rate decreases with increasing
CO partial pressure, while the reverse holds true for the dependence
on H2 partial pressure. The negative reaction order with
respect to CO can be interpreted in terms of a decrease in free sites
needed for CO dissociation.59 An alternative
interpretation is a lack of H atoms needed for methanation. The reaction
order with respect to H2 is slightly higher than unity,
implying that hydrogenation of CO or hydrogenation of C or O atoms
are rate-controlling steps. We observe that the reaction order with
respect to H2 based on the CH4 formation rate
is higher than the corresponding reaction order based on the formation
rate of C2+-hydrocarbon products. This suggests that the
H2 partial pressure dependence at least in part originates
from the rate-controlling nature of hydrogenation of C atoms, as less
C hydrogenation steps for each C atom are involved in the formation
of C2+-hydrocarbon products than in the formation of CH4. The rate of CO2 formation increases with CO partial
pressure and decreases with H2 partial pressure. These
dependencies point to competition of O removal pathways via CO2 and H2O. Although CO2 formation cannot
be neglected especially at high CO partial pressure, the dominant
O removal pathway is via H2O. It is interesting to note
that the chain-growth probability only changes significantly with
CO partial pressure, implying a strong influence of surface coverage
on the chain-growth process. This observation will be discussed in
more detailed in a companion paper that focuses on similar measurements
under FT conditions at a temperature of 220 °C.

Steady-State Isotopic Transient Kinetic Analysis (SSITKA)
After attaining steady state in a 12CO/H2 mixture, the catalyst was subjected to a SSITKA switch from 12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2 in
order to determine residence times (τ) of CO and CHx (intermediates leading to CH4) by use
of eqs 1 and 2. Long residence time indicates low activity, and
vice versa. Together with the site-normalized rates, CO and CHx coverages can then be obtained by use of eqs 3 and 4. These residence times and coverages are plotted as a function of
the CO and H2 partial pressure in Figure 2. In good agreement with other studies,30 a higher CO partial pressure leads to a longer
residence time of CHx. The reverse holds
for changes in the H2 partial pressure. As widely assumed
in literature, CH4 formation rate is a pseudo-first-order
process with respect to the coverage of CHx (θCHx),22,28−34 5  where k′ is a pseudo-first-order
rate constant and, together with eq 4, we can state that 6  

Figure 2 Residence
times (left panels) and equivalent coverages (right panels)
of CO (squares), CHx (circles), and extra-CH4 (triangles, defined in Figure 4.) as a function of CO partial pressure (a) and H2 partial pressure (b). Conditions: T = 260
°C, pH2 = 450 mbar at
varying CO partial pressure, pCO = 90
mbar at varying H2 partial pressure.

However, the pseudo-first-order assumption is not valid as
the
residence time also depends on the reactant partial pressure. Accordingly,
we employed a more detailed analysis of the SSITKA results in which
we assume that either C hydrogenation or CO dissociation is limiting
the rate of CH4 formation. The first assumption leads to
decoupling of the pseudo-first-order rate constant via 7  where kCHx is the rate constant of
hydrogenation and
θH the H coverage. Therefore 8  

It should
be noted that, at constant H2 partial pressure,
an increase in CO partial pressure will considerably reduce the H
coverage, because the CO adsorbs much stronger than H2.60,61 On the other hand, changing H2 partial pressure affects
CO coverage less profoundly as is evident from Figure 2b. Therefore, the dependence of τCHx on either CO partial pressure or H2 partial
pressure should be largely due to a change in the H coverage, even
though this cannot be exactly measured.

Alternatively, when
CO dissociation is assumed to be rate-limiting,
the rate can be approximated by 9  where kdiss is
the rate constant of CO dissociation and θv and θCO the surface coverages of free sites and CO, respectively.
However, this assumption fails in interpreting the SSITKA observations
as a function of H2 partial pressure. We observe that CO
coverage changes only slightly with varying H2 partial
pressure (Figure 2b).
Considering the constant CO partial pressure, the amount of vacant
sites is not expected to significantly change with increasing H2 partial pressure. Consequently, the product of slightly changed
θv and θCO cannot explain the 7-fold-increase
in CH4 formation rate with increasing H2 partial
pressure from 270 mbar to 1350 mbar (Figure 1).

We therefore conclude that CH4 formation under methanation
conditions is most likely controlled by hydrogenation steps that involve
H atoms rather than by a CO dissociation step that involves vacancies.
We also emphasize that the surface coverage plays an important role
in determining the rate-controlling steps. It is to be expected that
the FT reaction will occur in a different regime as CO coverage will
be higher at the typically used lower temperature. SSITKA results
obtained at 260 °C (this study) show the coverage of CO, the
most abundant surface species, is typically no more than 0.3, which
is lower than the value obtained at FT condition in a companion paper (typically 0.4 at 220 °C) and in literature
(0.4830 and 0.4531 at 210 °C). We should take care here, as analysis based on
SSITKA alone is not able to distinguish an H-assisted CO dissociation
mechanism from C hydrogenation as the rate-determining step, because
both depend on the H coverage. As outlined above, we have demonstrated
that direct CO dissociation on the same Co/SiO2 catalyst
is possible and can be correlated to a minority site at the surface.53 Therefore, the minor increase in CO coverage
will significantly influence the reaction kinetics. This scenario
will be discussed in a companion paper.

The SSITKA results reveal the strong influence of hydrogenation
on the overall CO consumption rate. Both C and O hydrogenation should
be considered. We therefore combine the results from SSITKA with those
obtained in forward and backward CTKA and use them to fit a microkinetic
model for CO hydrogenation to CH4. From this analysis,
we can identify rate-controlling steps.

Backward Chemical Transient
Kinetic Analysis
The backward
CTKA experiment comprises a CO/H2 → Ne/H2 switch. Figure 3 shows
that this switch leads to an increase in the CH4 formation
rate followed by a decline toward zero. This phenomenon was first
observed for a fused iron catalyst by Matsumoto and Bennett.17 Later, Cant et al. reported similar behavior
for a Ru catalyst,62 attributing the increased
methane formation rate to increased H coverage. Biloen also observed
the same for a Ru catalyst and suggested that the initial increase
in rate of methane formation is due to an increasing pseudo-first-order
rate constant of methane formation.19 Kruse
and co-workers discussed similar backward transient phenomena for
a Co/MgO catalyst.56−58 They interpreted these CTKA data as evidence for
the CO-insertion mechanism. More recently, Ralston et al. explained
cobalt particle size-dependent CTKA data in terms of structure sensitivity,
i.e., lack of B5–B sites for CO dissociation on
small Co nanoparticles.63

Figure 3 Backward transient at
different CO partial pressures (a) and H2 partial pressures
(b) after a switch from CO/H2 to H2. Conditions: T = 260 °C, pH2 = 450 mbar at varying CO partial
pressure, pCO = 90 mbar at varying H2 partial pressure.

The CTKA transients obtained at different CO and H2 partial
pressures are shown in Figure 3. The maximum CH4 formation rates during the transient
coincide with an optimum surface coverage ratio of vacancies, CO,
CHx, and H, of which the latter two determine
the CH4 formation rate. At constant H2 pressure,
the H coverage will depend linearly on the fraction of free sites
according to the adsorption equilibrium of H2. Accordingly,
the optimum rate is achieved at optimum ratio of θCHx and θH. This ratio
is independent of the initial steady-state coverage of CO, but is
reached later in time when the starting coverage is higher (Figure 3a). However, when
the CO partial pressure is constant and the H2 partial
pressure is varied, the H2 adsorption equilibrium will
lead to increasing H coverage at higher H2 partial pressure.
This will lead to higher and earlier maximum CH4 formation
rate (Figure 3b). Evidently,
the CH4 formation rate is highly dependent on the H coverage.

Here, we combine for the first time SSITKA with backward CTKA in
order to construct Figure 4. In this figure, we compare CH4 formation from two different transient experiments, viz. SSITKA
and backward CTKA measurements. As only CH4 formed during
SSITKA can be assigned to CHx species
present on the surface during steady state, we define the difference
as “extra-CH4”. We quantified this amount
and converted it to an equivalent surface coverage by using the available
Co surface area as determined by H2-chemisorption. This
surface coverage of species generating extra-CH4 is compared
to the CO coverage as determined by SSITKA. These data are displayed
in Figure 2. Notably,
at sufficiently high H2/CO ratios (either at relatively
low CO partial pressure or relatively high H2 partial pressure),
the amount of extra-CH4 is equivalent to the amount of
CO adsorbed on the Co surface during the steady state preceding the
CTKA switch. This result indicates that the extra-CH4 formed
during the backward CTKA switch at high H2/CO ratio can
be attributed solely to conversion of adsorbed CO to methane. At low
H2/CO ratio, the amount of extra-CH4 is slightly
higher than the amount of adsorbed CO. This cannot be accounted for
by higher hydrocarbon fragments present on the surface that would
dissociate and hydrogenate to CH4, because even at the
lowest H2/CO ratio the CH4 selectivity is higher
than 60% with the CHx coverage being approximately
5% (Figure 2). As higher
hydrocarbons formation typically follows an Anderson−Schulz–Flory
distribution, the coverage of C2+-products must be even
lower than 5%. In this way, a pool of higher hydrocarbons cannot explain
the extra-CH4 formed relative to the amount of adsorbed
CO.

Figure 4 Normalized responses in SSITKA and backward CTKA. The extra-CH4 is defined by as the filled area between SSITKA CH4 (squares) and backward CTKA CH4 (circles) responses.
Steady-state conditions: T = 260 °C, pH2 = 450 mbar, pCO = 90 mbar.

Another point worth mentioning about the data in Figure 4 is that the CO signal
during
the SSITKA switch exhibits a delay of 1 s with respect to the inert
tracer gas. This delay is caused by the adsorption/desorption equilibrium
of CO in the catalyst bed, also known as the chromatographic effect.
The CO response in the CO/H2 → H2 backward
CTKA switch did not exhibit this delay. Close inspection reveals that
the CO signal precedes the inert tracer signal. It implies that all
CO adsorbed on the Co surface is consumed and leaves the reactor predominantly
as CH4. An important corollary of this finding is that
the overall barrier for CO hydrogenation to CH4 is lower
than the CO desorption energy under methanation condition.

In
order to understand the deviation between the amount of extra-CH4 and adsorbed CO, we carried out temperature-programmed hydrogenation
(TPH) experiments of samples in which the flow was switched from CO/H2 to Ar, followed by flushing in Ar for 6 h at 260 °C.
After cooling to room temperature, a TPH experiments was carried out.
As shown in Figure 5, there are likely two carbon-containing surface species that are
hydrogenated at relatively low temperature, which is below 220 °C.
The data show that this carbon pool is not present at high H2/CO ratio, but is formed in increasing amounts when the H2/CO ratio is lowered. The nature of these carbon-containing surface
intermediates remains unclear, but a particular property is that they
can only be hydrogenated at sufficiently high H coverage as occurs
during TPH and during the backward CTKA. Clearly, the surface will
also contain even less-reactive C species as demonstrated by the reduction
feature above 300 °C. Similar observations have been reported
by Winslow and Bell.35 Flushing a working
Ru catalyst in He followed by temperature-programmed reduction in
D2 led to two CD4 peaks designated as Cα and Cβ, which are assigned to reactive
intermediate and less reactive species causing deactivation, respectively.

260 °C for 6 h. The partial pressures presented in the graph
relate to the reaction feed before the H2 purge.

Forward Chemical Transient
Kinetic Analysis
We use
forward CTKA to distinguish between rates of C and O hydrogenation.
As the H coverage during methanation is high, both C and O hydrogenation
reactions are fast. It is thus difficult to differentiate between
the rates of these two reactions. Therefore, we decreased the H2 partial pressure (200 mbar) and increased CO partial pressure
(200 mbar) to amplify differences in C and O hydrogenation. The results
of the forward CTKA switch are given in Figure 6. For these measurements, we analyzed both
CH4 and H2O as primary products. Analyzing H2O during transient measurements is a challenge, because H2O will relatively strongly interact with various parts of
the setup outside the catalyst bed (mainly with the stainless-steel
capillary). Accordingly, we carefully established the systematic delay
due to these nonspecific interactions (see the Supporting Information). The H2O delay values discussed
below have been corrected for this systematic delay, as well as the
delay caused by the chromatographic effect of CO. As before, the CH4 delay has also been corrected for the chromatographic effect
of CO.

Figure 6 Forward transient on the initially empty cobalt surface (a), the
H-covered surface (b), and the 13C precovered surface (c).
The signal intensities are normalized based on the flow rate before
and after the gas switch. Steady-state conditions: T = 260 °C, pH2 = 200
mbar, pCO = 200 mbar.

As a reference case, we performed the forward CTKA switch
on an
empty cobalt surface. We obtained this state by flushing the in situ
reduced Co catalyst in Ar for 2 h, followed by cooling to reaction
temperature in Ar. The forward transient involved an Ar/Ne →
H2/CO switch. Figure 6a shows that CH4 formation was delayed 2.5
s with respect to Ne, while H2O was delayed approximately
6.5 s with respect to Ne. The specific evolution of the CH4, H2O, and H2 signals also evidence that H2 is more rapidly consumed for hydrogenation of C toward CH4 on an initially empty cobalt surface.

The same transient
experiment was also performed on a catalyst
that was precovered by H2 followed by a H2/Ne
→ CO/H2 switch. In this case, the H coverage before
the switch is much higher than that at reaction condition. The corresponding
results in Figure 6b show a shorter H2O delay of 0.5 s, while the decrease
in the CH4 delay (2 s) is less pronounced. This comparison
implies that the H2O delay on an empty surface is caused
by a lack of adsorbed H, and that the O hydrogenation profits more
from higher H coverage than C hydrogenation.

We also carried
out an experiment in which we precovered the surface
with 13C atoms by exposure to 13CO flow at 260
°C for 0.5 h, followed by Ar flushing to remove adsorbed 13CO. As demonstrated earlier, this procedure results in the
deposition of C atoms on the Co surface.64,65 As shown in Figure 6c, the forward transient Ar/Ne → H2/CO of this 13C atom precovered surface results in a significant longer
H2O delay of 10 s, 3.5 s longer than on the empty surface
and 9.5 s longer than on the H precovered surface. This increase in
H2O delay is caused by two factors. On one hand, since
the surface was partially covered by 13C deposits, 12CO adsorption and dissociation cannot proceed until a certain
fraction of 13C has been removed by hydrogenation. The
correspondence between the H2 and 13CH4 signals shown in Figure 6b represents the strong dependence of C hydrogenation on H
coverage. On the other hand, the preadsorbed 13C deceases
H coverage. In line with the observation that an increase in H coverage
effectively shortens the H2O delay, the extra consumption
of adsorbed H atoms caused by hydrogenation of precovered 13C results in a longer H2O delay with respect to 12CH4 on a 13C precovered cobalt surface (6 s)
as compared to the empty surface (4 s). We stress that the competition
between C and O hydrogenation is partially due to the low H2/CO ratio in this case. The findings above also suggest that the
strong dependence of H2O formation on the H coverage significantly
contributes to the reaction order with respect to H2.

Microkinetic Modeling
A common approach to distinguish
mechanisms is to fit steady-state catalytic data to a microkinetic
model based on a mechanism consisting of elementary reaction steps.
A major limitation of transient kinetic studies of CO hydrogenation
is that the H coverage cannot be explicitly measured. This dependence
is therefore often lumped into hydrogenation reaction rate constants.
Here, we take a different approach in which we use transient data
to fit a microkinetic model for CO hydrogenation involving H explicitly
as a surface species. The elementary reaction steps that make up the
microkinetic model for CO hydrogenation is given in Figure 7. The alternative kinetic model
that involves H-assisted CO dissociation is provided in the Supporting Information. We will first discuss
the set of coupled nonlinear differential equations that describes
the transient coverages of surface adsorbed species, which are the
reaction intermediates. The surface coverage of CO can be described
as follows: 10  

Figure 7 Schematic presentation
of reaction model based on direct CO dissociation
mechanism.

The balance for CHx species involves
CHx hydrogenation/dehydrogenation steps
and also the CO dissociation for the C intermediate: 11   12   13   14  

The balance for OHx intermediates involves
CO dissociation, removal of O via H2O and CO2: 15   16   17  

The balance for adsorbed CO2 is given by 18  

Finally, we provide the balance for the H surface intermediate 19  where θv refers the vacant
sites on surface.

An additional constraint is that the sum of
all coverages is unity: 20  

We then used a procedure to fit this
model to experimental transient
CH4 signals (comprising SSITKA, forward CTKA and backward
CTKA). We choose transient data obtained at a high H2/CO
ratio of 15 (pCO = 30 mbar, pH2 = 450 mbar and T = 260
°C) so as to ensure a high CH4 selectivity of approximately
90% and a chain-growth probability smaller than 0.1. A least-squares
objective function is used as following 21  in which f denotes the normalized
transient response of methane, n the reaction order,
and w is a factor for giving a similar weight to
the reaction orders as that to the transient data. To decrease the
number of unknown variables, we introduced equilibrium constants for
several surface reactions based on DFT calculations for the Co(112̅1)
surface (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Finally, a total of 16 rate constants
were fitted. The boundary conditions and the details about the fitting
procedure are discussed in the Supporting Information. The fitting results are listed in Table 2 (the results based on H-assisted CO dissociation
are listed in Table S2). The good correspondence
between the model and the experimental data is shown in Figure 8. The goodness of fit for the
microkinetic model based on direct CO dissociation (R2 = 0.95) is higher than the one on H-assisted CO dissociation
(R2 = 0.88). We emphasize that this criterion
alone is not sufficient to rule out that a H-assisted mechanism occurs
in parallel with direct CO dissociation. Therefore, we discuss the
fitting results for a model based on H-assisted CO dissociation in
the Supporting Information.

Based on the fitted data, we then analyzed
the different kinetic
regimes of the CO hydrogenation reaction by determining the degree
of rate control (DRC, see the Supporting Information). By doing so, one can identify to what extent particular elementary
reaction steps control the overall CO conversion rate.66,67 A positive DRC value (XDRC,i) indicates that the overall reaction rate increases when the
rate of elementary step i is increased. On the contrary,
steps with a negative XDRC,i are rate-inhibiting steps that slow down the overall rate.
The results are presented in Table 3 in terms of lumped DRC parameters for key reaction
steps in the CO hydrogenation mechanism. A detailed list of DRC values
is provided in the Supporting Information. Table 3 shows that
C hydrogenation steps control the methanation reaction most. The other
reaction that controls the overall rate is O hydrogenation for which
we identify a XDRC of 0.24. The DRC for
the C–O bond scission step is only 0.15, emphasizing its weak
rate-controlling nature with the hydrogenation steps. The DRC analysis
based on the H-assisted CO dissociation mechanism shows qualitatively
similar results (Table S3), suggesting
that the conclusion of slow C and O hydrogenation at methanation conditions
is independent of the CO dissociation mechanism. These conclusions
are in good agreement with a recent theoretical study68 and also the forward transient experiments in this study.

CO dissociation	0.15

O hydrogenation	0.24	
CO2 formation	3.2 × 10–2	
An important conclusion from this kinetic
analysis is that CO dissociation
is not the rate-limiting step on cobalt at sufficiently high H2/CO ratio and high temperature (pertaining to a relatively
empty surface). Instead, the hydrogenation of the O and especially
C species deriving from CO dissociation control the reaction rate.
This finding is consistent with the experimental observation that
the absolute value of H2 reaction order for CH4 formation is larger than that of CO reaction order, implying H2 partial pressure affects the reaction more strongly than
CO does. The influence of H2 partial pressure on the reaction
rate is larger, as the H coverage is directly related to the H2 partial pressure; the influence of CO partial pressure is
smaller as it indirectly influences the reaction by hindering H2 adsorption.

The present work demonstrates that multiple
elementary reaction
steps can contribute to the rate control of the methanation reaction.
The positive order with respect to H2 is due to the rate-controlling
nature of C and O hydrogenation steps. The negative CO reaction order
is due to the competition between CO and H2 adsorption,
in which an increase in CO coverage decreases the H coverage that
is needed for catalyzing the rate-controlling C and O hydrogenation
steps.

Microkinetics Simulations
We employ the fitted microkinetic
model to explore the effect of a wider range of CO and H2 partial pressures, that is, from 0.06 to 20 bar and 0.03–10
bar, respectively. The output of these microkinetic simulations is
presented in Figure 9 in the form of a DRC analysis, surface coverages, and CO2 selectivity. Four regimes can be distinguished on the basis of the
DRC values. In regime 1, the H2 partial pressure is substantially
higher than the CO partial pressure. Consequently, CO coverage is
low and H coverage high. In this regime, C and O atoms derived from
CO dissociation are rapidly removed as CH4 and H2O, respectively, and CO dissociation becomes increasingly rate-controlling
with increasing H2 pressure. Thus, C and O hydrogenation
steps do not limit the CO conversion rate, but CO dissociation does.
In regime 2, the surface contains a significant amount of CHx intermediates as the lack of H atoms limits their
hydrogenation. Regime 3 presents the conditions with moderate H2/CO ratio (the diagonal lines in Figure 9 refer to a H2/CO ratio of 2),
a condition close to the FT condition. CO dissociation and C hydrogenation
steps largely contribute to the overall rate control. Due to the accumulation
of OHx intermediates on the surface (Figure 9g), H2O formation considerably controls the CO conversion rate in this
regime. This is in line with recent DFT-based microkinetics simulations.68 Meanwhile, Regime 4 refers to the lean H condition,
under which the cobalt surface is fully covered by CO (Figure 9h). In this case, O is predominantly
removed as CO2 (Figure 9i), as the surface lacks H atoms for O hydrogenation.

Figure 9 Degree
of rate control (a-d), surface coverage (e-h) and CO2 selectivity
(i) as a function of CO and H2 partial
pressures based on a microkinetic model using parameters obtained
by fitting of transient data for the methanation reaction on Co/SiO2 (conditions: T = 260 °C, pH2 = 450 mbar, pCO = 30 mbar.).

These regimes provide
us some insight into the different kinetic
regimes one might encounter when varying the H2/CO ratio.
Notably, regime 4 is an extreme case, stemming from the higher CO2 selectivity observed at 260 °C than at the actual FT
temperature. As expected, the rate-controlling steps at conditions
close to FT conditions (upper right corner in Figure 9) differ from those under methanation conditions
(lower right corner in Figure 9). It appears that the very different composition of the surface
adsorbed layer at lower temperature will have a significant impact
on the rate-controlling nature of the different elementary reaction
steps. These aspects are the focus of our companion paper which uses
similar transient methodologies to interrogate the reaction mechanism
of the Co/SiO2 catalyst under conditions close to those
encountered in practical FT synthesis.

Conclusions
The
mechanism of CO hydrogenation to CH4 at 260 °C
on a cobalt catalyst is interrogated by different types of transient
kinetic measurements including SSITKA and backward and forward CTKA.
The dependence of CHx residence time as
determined by SSITKA (12CO/H2 → 13CO/H2) on CO and H2 partial pressure
indicates that the CH4 formation rate is mainly controlled
by CHx hydrogenation rather than CO dissociation.
The backward CO/H2 → H2 CTKA emphasizes
the importance of H coverage on the slow CHx hydrogenation step. The H coverage strongly depends on the
CO coverage, which is mainly determined by CO partial pressure. By
combining SSITKA and backward CTKA, it is established that the additional
CH4 obtained during CTKA in comparison to SSITKA is nearly
equal in amount to the amount of CO adsorbed on the cobalt surface.
This implies that under the given conditions the overall barrier for
CO hydrogenation to CH4 is lower than the CO adsorption
energy. Forward CTKA measurements also qualitatively show that O hydrogenation
is relatively slow compared to CO dissociation. The combined transient
kinetic data are captured in an explicit microkinetic model for the
methanation reaction. The model fitting shows that a mechanism involving
direct CO dissociation better represents the data than a mechanism
in which H-assisted CO dissociation is assumed. Microkinetics simulations
based on the fitted parameters show the highest DRC for C hydrogenation
and lower DRC for O hydrogenation and CO dissociation at typical methanation
conditions. These simulations are also used to explore different conditions
depending on CO and H2 partial pressure. This leads to
four kinetic regimes in which CO consumption rate is controlled by
CO dissociation, C hydrogenation, O hydrogenation, and CO2 formation.
