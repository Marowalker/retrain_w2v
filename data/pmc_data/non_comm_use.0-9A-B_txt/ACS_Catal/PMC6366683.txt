pharmaceutically active GABA analogues, and highlights the exciting
opportunities available for combining chemocatalysts, natural enzymes,

Introduction
Analogues of γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA, Figure 1) represent abundantly prescribed
drugs, which are broadly applied as anticonvulsants, as antidepressants
and for the treatment of neuropathic pain. With an increasing world
population and life expectancy, the demand for GABA analogues is expected
to even further increase. The efficient asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceutically
active GABA analogues has therefore attracted enormous attention.
With current synthesis routes often involving kinetic resolutions,1−3 there is a need to investigate alternative asymmetric synthesis
routes that are potentially greener, more sustainable, and more step-economic.
In this regard, the use of a systems (bio)catalysis approach4−8 in which different catalysts are combined to construct reaction
cascades for efficient synthesis of GABA analogues is an attractive
idea. This approach aims to minimize the number of reaction steps
and improve the “pot-economy” of the process.9

GABA
analogues. (A) Envisioned (chemo)enzymatic cascade synthesis of pharmaceutically
active GABA analogues. Abbreviations: 4-OT*, newly engineered 4-OT
variant that functions as a highly enantioselective artificial “Michaelase”;

GABA and its analogues pregabalin, phenibut, baclofen, and fluorophenibut.

We envisioned that pharmaceutically
active GABA analogues, such
as pregabalin, phenibut, baclofen, and fluorophenibut, could be prepared
via one-pot three-step (chemo)enzymatic cascade reactions, using simple
and inexpensive starting materials and avoiding (de)protecting steps
and intermediate purifications (Figure 1). For establishing the required C–C bond stereochemistry,
the asymmetric Michael-type addition of acetaldehyde (1) to nitroalkenes 2a–d is of high
interest. This would give convenient access to chiral γ-nitroaldehydes 3a–d, which in two steps (oxidation of 3a–d into 4a–d followed by reduction of 4a–d into 5a–d) can be converted into
the desired GABA analogues.

The asymmetric Michael-type addition
of 1 to 2a–d is certainly
not trivial. Multiple
organocatalytic approaches to obtain enantioenriched γ-nitroaldehydes
have been reported, mainly using small peptide- and proline-based
organocatalysts.10−13 However, examples including acetaldehyde as donor substrate are
scarce and a high catalyst loading in organic solvent is typically
applied. Therefore, there is great interest in the development of
biocatalytic procedures for the enantioselective synthesis of γ-nitroaldehydes.
However, enzymes that naturally catalyze these required carbon–carbon
bond-forming Michael-type additions are not known to be present in
nature. In fact, only a few enzymes are known to be able to catalyze
any type of C–C bond-forming Michael-type addition.14,15 Interestingly, Hilvert and co-workers published the elegant enzymatic
synthesis of γ-nitroketones, but not γ-nitroaldehydes,
by both acetone addition to nitroalkenes and nitroalkane addition
to conjugated ketones using a highly engineered computationally designed
retroaldolase.16 We have previously reported
that 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) can promiscuously catalyze
the addition of small aldehydes, most notably the highly reactive
acetaldehyde, to various aliphatic and aromatic nitroalkenes.17−20 Analogous to proline-based organocatalysts, the 4-OT enzyme utilizes
an N-terminal proline (Pro-1) as key catalytic residue in promiscuous
aldol condensations21,22 and Michael-type additions,19 most likely via enamine catalysis.22,23 By using mutability-landscape guided enzyme engineering,24 a mutant of 4-OT (4-OT M45Y/F50A) was generated
that showed inverted enantioselectivity in acetaldehyde additions
to nitroalkenes,25 allowing the enzymatic
synthesis of the pharmaceutically relevant enantiomers of γ-nitroaldehydes 3a–d. However, the enantioselectivity
of 4-OT M45Y/F50A is too low for biocatalytic application, providing
the desired γ-nitroaldehyde products with only modest enantiomeric
excess.25

Here, we report the development
of a tailor-made artificial “Michaelase”,
which exhibits improved enantioselectivity, activity and cosolvent
stability compared to the parental enzyme 4-OT M45Y/F50A, for additions
of 1 to nitroalkenes 2a–d yielding γ-nitroaldehydes 3a–d with outstanding enantiopurity. This artificial “Michaelase”
was combined with a natural aldehyde dehydrogenase and a cofactor
recycling NADH-oxidase to give a one-pot two-step reaction cascade
for the synthesis of γ-nitrobutyric acids 4a–d in high yields and with excellent enantiomeric excess. Finally,
the reaction cascade was further extended by the inclusion of nickel
boride, promoting the conversion of enzymatically prepared 4a–d into the desired GABA analogues 5a–d, which resulted in a one-pot three-step chemoenzymatic
reaction cascade (Figure 1A). Given that all steps were performed under aqueous conditions
with high conversions, the desired GABA analogues 5a–d were obtained in good isolated yields of up to 70% and with
excellent enantiomer ratio (e.r.) values of up to 99:1. This new methodology
offers a step-economic alternative route to important pharmaceutically
active GABA analogues, and highlights the exciting opportunities available
for combining chemocatalysts, natural enzymes, and designed artificial
biocatalysts in multistep syntheses of valuable chemical products.

Experimental
Methods
Library Screening
After transformation with 4-OT I2X/L8X/M45Y/F50A
library DNA, individual E. coli BL21(DE3) colonies
were used to inoculate 2× 1.25 mL LB supplemented with 100 μg/mL
ampicillin and 100 μM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) in 96-deep well plates (Greiner Bio-one, 96-well Masterblock).
The plates were sealed with sterile gas-permeable seals (Greiner Bio-one,
BREATHseal) and incubated at 37 °C, with overnight shaking at
250 rpm. After the incubation, the plates were centrifuged (2232g, 8 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the individual
pellets were lysed by resuspension in 350 μL of BugBuster (Novagen)
supplemented with 25 U/mL benzonase (Novagen). The lysis was continued
for 20 min at room temperature under vigorous shaking. The lysates
were cleared by centrifugation (2232g, 55 min, 4
°C) after which the Cell Free Extract (CFE) was obtained. The
final reaction mixture for monitoring the addition of 1 to 2a consisted of the following: CFE (40% v/v), 150
mM 1, 5 mM 2a, DMSO (5% v/v) in 20 mM sodium
phosphate buffer pH 6.5, 500 μL final volume. The reactions
were performed in 96-deep well plates sealed by ultraviolet transparent
plate seals (VIEWseal, Greiner Bio-One) at room temperature. After
50 min the reaction was stopped by extraction with 300 μL toluene,
which caused the proteins to precipitate. The organic layer was separated
from the water layer by centrifugation (2232g, 20
min). The plates containing the water and organic layer were incubated
at −80 °C for 30 min to freeze the water layer and hence
preventing accidental uptake of part of the water layer. An aliquot
of 50 μL from the organic layer was transferred to a GC vial
by a robotic pipetting station. For analysis of the amount and enantiopurity
of the enzymatic product 3a, 8 μL of the organic
layer was injected on a gas chromatograph using an Astec CHIRALDEX
G-TA column, isocratic 125 °C (carrier gas He, 1.69 mL/min).
Flame ionization detection; retention time S-3a: 25.6 min, retention time R-3a 26.9 min. The assignment of the absolute configuration of product 3a was based on earlier reported data.17,25

Semipreparative Scale Experiments
All semipreparative
scale experiments were based on previously reported reaction conditions.17,25 Instead of DMSO, ethanol was used as a cosolvent, since the desired
products 3a–d were obtained at the
highest enantiopurity using 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A in combination with
ethanol as the cosolvent. For the enzymatic synthesis of 3a, the reaction mixture consisted of the following: 5.0 mg 2a (3 mM), 6.5 mg 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A (75 μM, 2.5 mol % compared
to 2a), and 2.56 mL ethanol (20% v/v) in 20 mM sodium
phosphate buffer pH 6.5 to a final volume of 12.8 mL. The reaction
was performed in a 25 mL Erlenmeyer flask sealed with a rubber stopper.
The reaction was initiated by the addition of 108 μL of 1 (150 mM) and incubated at room temperature. At timely intervals,
a sample was withdrawn from the reaction mixture and the reaction
progress was monitored by following the depletion in absorbance at
249 nm corresponding to the concentration of substrate 2a.17 After the measurement, the sample
was combined with the reaction mixture. After 50 min the reaction
was finished and the reaction mixture was extracted 3× with 10
mL toluene. The organic layers were combined, washed with brine, and
dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The dried organic
layer was concentrated in vacuo, yielding product 3a without
any further purification (4.2 mg, 63% isolated yield). The enantiopurity
and absolute configuration was determined by GC with a chiral stationary
phase (see library screening).

For the enzymatic synthesis of 3b–d, the reaction mixture consisted of
the following: nitroalkene (17.9 mg of 2b, 2 mM; 14.3
mg of 2c, 1.3 mM; or 20.1 mg of 2d, 2 mM),
11.5 mg of 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A (28 μM, 1.4 mol % compared to 2b and 2d, 2.15 mol % compared to 2c), ethanol (12 mL, 20% (v/v) for 2b and 2d and 18 mL, 30% (v/v) for 2c) in 20 mM sodium phosphate
buffer pH 6.5 to a final volume of 60 mL. The reaction was performed
in a 100 mL Erlenmeyer flask sealed with a rubber stopper. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of 169 μL 1 (50 mM)
and incubated at room temperature. At timely intervals a sample was
withdrawn from the reaction mixture and the reaction progress was
monitored by following the depletion in absorbance (λmax of 2b and 2c at 320 nm, λmax of 2d at 322 nm). After the measurement, the sample
was combined with the reaction mixture. When the reaction was finished,
the reaction mixture was extracted with 3× 40 mL ethyl acetate.
The organic layers were combined, washed with brine and dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4. The dried organic layer was
concentrated in vacuo, yielding 3b–d without any further purification (3b 20.1 mg, 87% yield; 3c 17.2 mg, 97% yield; and 3d 24.0 mg, 94% yield).
The aldehyde functionality of 3b and 3c was
derivatized to a cyclic acetal (see supporting methods). The enantiopurity
of 3b–d was determined by reverse
phase HPLC using a chiralpak AD-RH column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, Daicel)
(MeCN/water 70:30 for 3b, MeCN/water 62:38 for 3c and MeCN/water 30:70 for 3d, 25 °C, 0.5
mL/min flow rate). Detection at 220 nm, retention time R-3b: 8.3 min, S-3b 10.8
min; R-3c: 29 min, S-3c 37 min; R-3d: 39 min,
and S-3d: 41 min. The absolute configuration
was determined by literature comparison.17

Two-Step Enzymatic Cascade Synthesis
The reaction mixture
contained 2a (22 mg, 3 mM), 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A (5 mol
% compared to 2a), 5 mL of ethanol (10% v/v) in 0.1 M
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3) to a final volume of 50 mL. The reaction
was initiated by the addition of 50 mM of 1 (2.5 mL from
a freshly prepared 1 M stock solution) and the reaction mixture was
incubated at room temperature. At timely intervals, a sample was withdrawn
from the reaction mixture and the reaction progress was monitored
by following the depletion in absorbance at 249 nm corresponding to
the concentration of substrate 2a.17 After the measurement, the sample was combined with the
reaction mixture. After 20 min, the reaction was finished (full conversion
of 2a into 3a) and then to this PRO-ALDH(003)
(0.5 mg/mL), PRO-NOX(009) (1 mg/mL), and NAD+ (8 mM) were
added. We used this stepwise cascade approach because PRO-ALDH(003)
also showed activity toward starting substrate 1. Favorably,
the enzyme showed ∼3-fold higher activity toward substrate 3a (at 3 mM) than toward 1 (at 50 mM). Using
this methodology, complete oxidation of 3a into 4a was achieved with the formation of less than 10 mM acetate
as byproduct from 1. After the PRO-ALDH(003)-catalyzed
oxidation reaction was completed, the reaction was stopped by acidifying
the reaction mixture to pH 5. The reaction mixture was extracted with
3× 50 mL ethyl acetate. The organic layers were combined, washed
with brine, and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4.
The dried organic layer was concentrated in vacuo and the product
was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethyl acetate
4:1) to obtain 4a (18 mg, 64% yield). The acid functionality
of 4a was derivatized to the corresponding methyl ester
(see supporting methods). The same reaction procedures were followed
for the synthesis of 4b–d. The enantiopurity
of derivatized 4a was determined by GC using a chiral
Astec CHIRALDEX G-TA column, 100 to 140 °C at a rate of 4 °C/min,
then 140 to 160 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and finally held
at 160 °C. Flame ionization detection, retention time R-4a: 16 min, S-4a: 17 min. The enantiopurity of derivatized 4b–d was analyzed by reverse phase HPLC using a chiral column
(Chiralpak-ID, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, Daicel) (MeCN/water 30:70, 25
°C, 1 mL/min flow rate). Detection at 210 nm, retention time R-4b: 22.6 min, S-4b: 24.5 min; R-4c: 19.4 min, S-4c: 24.4 min; R-4d: 23.5 min, S-4d: 26.6 min.

Three-Step
Chemoenzymatic Cascade Synthesis
The reaction
mixture contained nitoalkene (3 mM of 2a and 4 mM of 2b–d), 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A (28–32
mg; 5 mol % compared to 2a–d), and
ethanol (10% v/v) in 0.1 M NaH2PO4 buffer (pH
7.3) to a final volume of 25 mL. The reaction was initiated by the
addition of 50 mM 1 (1.25 mL from a freshly prepared
1 M stock solution in 0.1 M NaH2PO4 buffer pH
7.3) and the reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature. At
timely intervals, a sample was withdrawn from the reaction mixture
and the reaction progress was monitored by following the depletion
in absorbance corresponding to the concentration of nitroalkene (see
above). After the measurement the sample was combined with the reaction
mixture. After the completion of the reaction, PRO-ALDH(003) (0.5
mg/mL), PRO-NOX(009) (1 mg/mL) and NAD+ (0.5 mM) were added
to the reaction mixture. After 30 min, the reaction was quenched by
acidifying the reaction mixture using 5 M HCl until the pH dropped
to 3. To this mixture, NiCl2·6H2O (40 mM)
and NaBH4 (40 mM) were added at 0 °C, and stirring
was continued for 24 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was
filtered through a Celite pad and the filtrate concentrated in vacuo,
after which the resulting concentrated mixture was acidified to pH
3–4. The acidified reaction mixture was loaded on a column
packed with cation exchange resin (5 g of Dowex 50WX8 hydrogen form).
After washing with deionized water (4 column volumes), the product
was eluted out with 0.5–1 M ammonia solution (4 column volumes).
The ninhydrin-positive fractions were collected, combined, and lyophilized
to yield the desired products 5a–d. Products 5a–d were derivatized
to diastereomers using sodium 2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl-l-valine amide (see the Supporting Information) and their enantiopurity was determined using reverse phase HPLC
on a C18 column (Kinetex 5u EVO C18 100A, 150 mm × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex)
at 25 °C (1 mL/min flow rate). The mobile phase was a 60:40 (v/v)
mixture of aqueous buffer (0.2% triethylamine, pH adjusted to 3.5
with dilute orthophosphoric acid) and MeCN. Detection at 340 nm, retention
time S-5a: 16.1 min, R-5a: 21.4 min; R-5b: 10.9
min, S-5b: 12.1 min; R-5c: 17.2 min, S-5c: 20.2
min; R-5d: 12.3 min, S-5d: 13.6 min.

Results
Effect of Cosolvents
on the Enzymatic Michael-Type Addition
Reaction
The previously reported 4-OT mutant M45Y/F50A25 exhibits inverted enantioselectivity when compared
to wild-type 4-OT, allowing the enzymatic synthesis of the pharmaceutically
relevant enantiomers of γ-nitroaldehydes 3a–d (Figure 1). However, the enantioselectivity of 4-OT M45Y/F50A is too low for
biocatalytic application, with for instance the production of 3a with an e.r. of 90:10 and 3c with an e.r.
of only 62:38.25 To improve the enantioselectivity
of the 4-OT M45Y/F50A catalyzed Michael-type additions, we initially
focused our efforts on solvent engineering. Indeed, the use of different
solvent systems has been reported to have a substantial effect on
the enantioselectivity of different enzyme catalyzed reactions.26,27 We selected the 4-OT catalyzed addition of 1 to 2a to test the effect of cosolvents on enantioselectivity,
because the optical purity of product 3a can be straightforwardly
analyzed by gas chromatography. Although the enzyme was still active
at concentrations of up to 40% (v/v) DMSO, increasing the DMSO concentration
had a detrimental effect on the enantioselectivity of the 4-OT M45Y/F50A-catalyzed
reaction (Figure 2).
A similar loss of enantioselectivity was observed when short-chain
alcohols such as ethanol or methanol were used as cosolvent. Notably,
ethanol and methanol concentrations of >20% (v/v) led to enzyme
precipitation,
which indicates a destabilizing effect of the cosolvent on the biocatalyst.
Using aqueous solutions of glyceline and ethaline (deep-eutectic solvents)
led to inactivation of the enzyme at all tested concentrations (10–60%,
v/v). Diols, however, could be used in high concentrations without
observing inactivation and with a positive effect on the enantioselectivity
(Figure 2). For example,
using up to 60% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol or 1,4-butanediol
did not affect the enzymatic activity and the e.r. of product 3a increased up to 95:5.

Michael-type addition reaction. Enantiopurity of 3a (as
the percentage of the S-enantiomer) in the 4-OT M45Y/F50A

in the presence of increasing concentrations of different cosolvents.

Engineering of a Highly
Enantioselective Artificial “Michaelase”
Although
solvent engineering slightly improved the enantioselectivity
of the addition of 1 to 2a catalyzed by
4-OT M45Y/F50A, at best a product e.r. of 95:5 was achieved. Therefore,
protein engineering was required to further enhance the enantioselectivity
of this reaction. To guide our engineering efforts, we used the available
crystal structure of 4-OT M45Y/F50A in complex with nitrostyrene 2b (PDB: 5CLO).25 This structure suggests that the
substrate may bind in two distinct orientations relative to Pro-1,
differing by a rotation of ∼180 deg around the longitudinal
axis of the substrate molecule. One substrate orientation is consistent
with the formation of the R enantiomer of the product,
whereas the other is consistent with formation of the S enantiomer. We reasoned that by reducing the rotational freedom
of the substrate in the active site and/or repositioning of Pro-1
relative to the substrate, the enantioselectivity of M45Y/F50A may
be improved. Therefore, we selected position Leu-8, the side chain
of which is involved in formation of the binding pocket for the substrate’s
R-group (Figure 1),
and position Ile-2, which is located next to Pro-1, for site-saturation
mutagenesis.28 Accordingly, a focused library
was constructed by randomizing positions Ile-2 and Leu-8 using NNK
degeneracy, yielding library I2X/L8X/M45Y/F50A. As the model reaction
for activity and enantioselectivity screening, the addition of 1 to 2a was chosen because the quantity and optical
purity of product 3a can be easily analyzed by gas chromatography.
We reasoned that if mutants displaying enhanced activity and enantioselectivity
were to be found, then they could be tested for their ability to facilitate
the enantioselective addition of acetaldehyde to aromatic nitroalkenes
as well.

The library was transformed into Escherichia
coli cells, and screened by evaluating 960 transformants.
This resulted in the identification of two quadruple mutants (I2W/L8Y/M45Y/F50A
and I2M/L8Y/M45Y/F50A) with significantly improved activity and enantioselectivity.
These mutant enzymes were purified to homogeneity and assayed for
their ability to catalyze the addition of 1 to 2a. Mutants I2W/L8Y/M45Y/F50A and I2M/L8Y/M45Y/F50A both displayed
excellent enantioselectivity, providing product S-3a with an e.r. of 99:1 (Table S1), and enhanced activity (4- and 5-fold, respectively) when
compared to that of M45Y/F50A (Figure 3a). Since both quadruple mutants contain the L8Y mutation,
the triple mutant L8Y/M45Y/F50A was constructed to test the importance
of the mutation at position Ile-2. In addition, the triple mutant
L8F/M45Y/F50A was constructed to test if a structurally similar residue
at position Leu-8 might result in better catalytic properties. Interestingly,
mutants L8Y/M45Y/F50A and L8F/M45Y/F50A exhibited excellent enantioselectivity
in the addition reaction yielding S-3a with an e.r. of 99:1 (Table S1). To our
delight, the catalytic activity of mutant L8Y/M45Y/F50A for the addition
of 1 to 2a was considerably improved (6-fold)
compared to that of the starting mutant M45Y/F50A and higher than
those of the quadruple mutants I2M/L8Y/M45Y/F50A and I2W/L8Y/M45Y/F50A
(Figure 3a). The activity
of mutant L8F/M45Y/F50A was slightly lower than that of L8Y/M45Y/F50A.
Satisfyingly, mutant L8Y/M45Y/F50A also displayed higher activity
(3.5-fold) for the addition of 1 to the aromatic nitroalkene 2c when compared to that of mutant M45Y/F50A (Figure 3b).

Different 4-OT mutants were used as a catalyst at a concentration

(b) Addition of 1 (65 mM) to 2c (1.3 mM)
in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and 45% (v/v) DMSO. Different
4-OT mutants were used as a catalyst at a concentration of 18 μM.
YA: 4-OT M45Y/F50A, YYA: 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A.

Coincidentally, when compared to mutant M45Y/F50A, mutant
L8Y/M45Y/F50A
also proved to be much more stable in the presence of the desirable
cosolvent ethanol, tolerating concentrations of up to 30% (v/v) without
losing activity or enantioselectivity. In fact, the enantioselectivity
of the 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A catalyzed addition of 1 to 2a in the presence of 25% (v/v) ethanol was exceptional, yielding
optically pure S-3a (the pregabalin
precursor) with an e.r. of >99:1 (Table S1). On the other hand, mutant L8F/M45Y/F50A was rather unstable in
the presence of ethanol, with significantly reduced activity already
at an ethanol concentration of 10% (v/v). Because the L8Y/M45Y/F50A
mutant showed the highest catalytic activity and enantioselectivity,
and because it tolerates relatively high concentrations of the cosolvent
ethanol without loss of performance, it was selected for further study.

The synthetic usefulness of mutant L8Y/M45Y/F50A was further investigated
in semipreparative scale experiments with nitroalkene acceptors 2a–d (Table 1). Ethanol was used as a cosolvent in all
reactions because in 20–30% (v/v) ethanol excellent enantioselectivity
was observed for the enzymatic additions. Under optimized conditions,
products 3a–d could be synthesized
with good isolated yields (63–97%) and excellent enantioselectivity
(e.r. up to >99:1). In all cases, the pharmaceutically relevant
enantiomer
of the γ-nitroaldehyde was synthesized [(S)-3a and (R)-3b–d]. These results demonstrate the potential of this newly engineered
artificial “Michaelase”, which displays enhanced activity,
improved enantioselectivity and better ethanol stability compared
to the parent enzyme, for the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure
γ-nitroaldehydes, which are important precursors for the valuable
pharmaceuticals pregabalin, phenibut, baclofen and fluorophenibut.

Structural
Basis for the Enhanced Enantioselectivity
To obtain insight
into how the active site of 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A
is remodelled to facilitate the highly enantioselective Michael-type
addition reactions, we determined its crystal structure at 1.9 Å
resolution (Table S2). The overall hexameric
structure of 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A is very similar to that of wild-type
4-OT (PDB entry: 4X19)23 and of mutant M45Y/F50A (PDB entry: 5CLN),25 with Cα-backbone root-mean-square-deviations of 0.38
and 0.69 Å, respectively. A more detailed structural comparison
of 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A and the parental enzyme 4-OT M45Y/F50A with
bound nitrostyrene (PDB entry: 5CLO)25 shows that
the extra mutation (L8Y) in the triple mutant results in a slight
shift of residues 5–17, comprising the last residues of strand
β1, the following loop, and the N-terminal residues of helix
α1 (maximum shift is 1.4 Å). In addition, residues 46–48
comprising the loop/310-helix after strand β2 show
a maximum shift of 2.2 Å. Residues Tyr-45 and Ala-50 line the
active site pocket, their side chains having a conformation very similar
to that observed in the M45Y/F50A mutant. Notably, two conformations
of Tyr-45 were observed. In one conformation, the side chain of Tyr-45
is rotated toward the substrate binding pocket. Overlaying this conformation
with the structure of M45Y/F50A in complex with nitrostyrene (2b) would result in a clash between the aromatic ring of 2b and Tyr-45, suggesting that this is not the active conformation.
In the second conformation, the side chain of Tyr-45 is flipped to
the back of the active site, making H-bond interactions with His-6,
similar as is observed in the structure of M45Y/F50A.

Most importantly,
at the interface of each dimer of the L8Y/M45Y/F50A mutant, the Tyr-8
side chain lies “above” the hydrophobic pocket that
binds the aromatic ring of 2b in the M45Y/F50A mutant
(Figure 4a). While
the pocket has become narrower due to the extra L8Y mutation, the
comparison with the M45Y/F50A structure indicates that it remains
capable to accommodate 2b, with the aromatic rings of
Tyr-8 and the substrate forming a parallel displaced π–π
stacking interaction (Figure 4b). The narrower substrate binding pocket is expected to be
less tolerant toward accommodating the alternate binding mode of 2b, which would give the opposite enantiomer of the corresponding
product, because the substrate has little freedom to adjust its conformation
and orientation to minimize unfavorable close contacts. These results
indicate that the enhanced enantioselectivity of the L8Y/M45Y/F50A
mutant is not due to major structural changes but is related to the
replacement of Leu-8 by a larger tyrosine residue, resulting in a
narrower substrate binding pocket that prevents the substrate to bind
in two distinct orientations relative to Pro-1. Thus, the reduction
in size of the substrate binding pocket explains the excellent enantioselectivity
of the 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A mutant.

mutant has the tyrosine side chain lying above a hydrophobic pocket

One-Pot Two-Step Enzymatic Cascade Synthesis of γ-Nitrobutyric
Acids
Having constructed an artificial “Michaelase”
that is highly enantioselective for the addition of acetaldehyde (1) to nitroalkenes 2a–d,
yielding γ-nitroaldehydes (S)-3a and (R)-3b–d (Table 1), we focused our
attention on the development of a two-step enzymatic cascade process
for the synthesis of γ-nitrobutyric acids 4a–d, which are more stable and practical GABA analogue precursors
than the corresponding γ-nitroaldehydes. The synthesis of these
compounds requires the coupling of the newly developed “Michaelase”
with an appropriate aldehyde oxidase or aldehyde dehydrogenase (Table 2). Notably, using
an oxidase would result in the formation of hydrogen peroxide as a
byproduct, which could unfavorably react with the aldehyde substrates
and enzyme catalysts, necessitating an additional step for its removal.
Therefore, an aldehyde dehydrogenase with a broad non-natural substrate
scope, PRO-ALDH(003) available from Prozomix Ltd., was used. Initial
experiments showed that PRO-ALDH(003) was dependent on either NAD+ or NADP+ and could accept both (R)-3a and (S)-3a as substrates.
For cofactor regeneration, we used an NADH oxidase, PRO-NOX(009) available
from Prozomix Ltd., which converts NADH to NAD+ using O2 and producing H2O. A water-forming NOX enzyme
is particularly suited to include in the envisioned cascade synthesis,
as it does not employ substrates or generate products that complicate
subsequent workup, resulting in increased purity and yield of 4a–d. Using our newly engineered artificial
“Michaelase” 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A in combination with
PRO-ALDH(003) and PRO-NOX(009), we developed a one-pot two-step biocatalytic
cascade to synthesize the desired product (S)-4a in 64% isolated yield and with an excellent e.r. of 99:1
(Table 2, entry 1).
Using similar conditions, also (R)-4b–d could be synthesized in good isolated yield
(67–70%) and with excellent e.r. values of up to 99:1 (Table 2, entries 2–4).

Synthesis of γ-Nitrobutyric Acids 4a–da

or 4-OT A33D to form either S-3a and R-3b–d or R-3a and S-3b–d respectively, followed by aldehyde oxidation catalyzed by
PRO-ALDH(003), using PRO-NOX(009) for cofactor recycling, to form
either S-4a and R-4b–d or R-4a and S-4b–d. The
reaction mixtures consisted of 50 mM 1, 3 mM 2a or 4 mM 2b–d in 100 mM sodium phosphate
buffer pH 7.3 and 10% (v/v) ethanol. Five mol % of 4-OT (compared
to concentration nitroalkene) was used, except for entry 6 (1.5 mol
%) and entry 7 (3 mol %). PRO-ALDH(003) was added to a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL, PRO-NOX(009) was added to a final concentration of 1
mg/mL. The concentration NAD+ was 8 mM (4a) or 10 mM (4b–d). The amounts of
applied cofactor were adjusted such that short reaction times and
high conversions were achieved.

d Products 4a–d were esterified and the e.r. was

with a chiral stationary phase.

Interestingly, the modularity of this enzymatic cascade approach
and the ability of PRO-ALDH(003) to accept both enantiomers of 3a–d as substrates, also allowed for the
synthesis of the opposite enantiomers of γ-nitrobutyric acids 4a–d. To this end, we replaced 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A
by the previously engineered enantiocomplementary 4-OT variant A33D,
which produces the opposite enantiomers of 3a–d.25 Under optimized conditions
and using the appropriate combination of enzymes in one pot, the desired
products (R)-4a and (S)-4b–d were obtained with excellent
e.r. values (99:1) and in 62–74% isolated yield (Table 2, entries 5–8).

One-Pot
Three-Step Chemoenzymatic Cascade Synthesis of γ-Aminobutyric
Acids
Having developed a modular one-pot two-step enzymatic
cascade for the production of both enantiomers of γ-nitrobutyric
acids 4a–d, we focused our attention
on the extension of this cascade by including a third step, converting 4a–d into the desired pharmaceutically
active γ-aminobutyric acids 5a–d. To the best of our knowledge, no enzymes have been reported that
can catalyze the full reduction of aliphatic nitro groups, such as
those present in 4a–d, to the corresponding
amines.29 While several procedures for
the chemical reduction of nitro groups have been reported, most of
these use organic solvents and are not suitable to be executed in
aqueous solutions. To prevent the necessity of intermediate purification
of 4a–d, we selected nickel boride
as catalyst (NiCl2·6H2O in combination
with NaBH4), because this system has been reported to catalyze
the reduction of nitro groups in aqueous solutions.30,31 Pleasingly, when using 10 equiv of nickel boride (NaBH4/NiCl2·6H2O), the complete reduction of 4a–d into 5a–d in aqueous buffer at pH 3 was achieved.

Having established
that nickel boride can be used to set up a three-step chemoenzymatic
cascade reaction, 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A, PRO-ALDH(003), PRO-NOX(009),
and NaBH4/NiCl2·6H2O were combined
in one pot. This chemoenzymatic cascade proved to be efficient, converting
the simple starting materials 1 and 2a into
the desired product (S)-5a with an isolated
yield of 55% and an excellent e.r. of 98:2 (Table 3, entry 1). Similarly, this one-pot three-step
reaction cascade could also be used to efficiently synthesize (R)-5b–d in good isolated
yields (65–70%) and with excellent e.r. values of 99:1 (Table 3, entries 2–4).
Thus, access to the pharmaceuticals pregabalin, phenibut, baclofen
and fluorophenibut has been achieved using this newly developed one-pot,
three-step chemoenzymatic cascade process.

Cascade Synthesis of Pharmaceuticals 5a–da

to form S-3a and R-3b–d, followed by aldehyde oxidation catalyzed
by PRO-ALDH(003), using PRO-NOX(009) for cofactor recycling, to form S-4a and R-4b–d, followed by nitro reduction catalyzed by
nickel boride to form S-5a and R-5b–d. The reaction mixtures
consisted of 50 mM 1, 3 mM 2a or 4 mM 2b–d in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer
pH 7.3 and 10% (v/v) ethanol. Five mol % of 4-OT (compared to concentration
of nitroalkene) was used; PRO-ALDH(003) was added to a final concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL; PRO-NOX(009) was added to a final concentration of 1
mg/mL; 0.5 mM of NAD+ was added; 40 mM of NiCl2 and 40 mM of NaBH4 were used. Because of the poor stability
of nickel boride in aqueous buffer, a 10-fold excess of this reagent
(40 mM versus 3–4 mM 2a–d)
is required to achieve high conversion.

f Products 5a–d were
derivatized using Nα-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-l-valinamide, and the e.r.
of the corresponding diastereomers was determined by HPLC with an
achiral stationary phase. Notably, the e.r. of product 5a is likely to be 99:1; however, because a minor contaminant from
the derivatizing agent has the same retention time as the R enantiomer of product 5a, the e.r. for product 5a is cautiously reported as 98:2, consistent with the observed
peaks in the HPLC chromatogram.

Discussion
The use of different enzymes to build reaction
cascades for efficient
synthesis of valuable chemical products is an emerging concept in
biocatalysis.4−7 This approach aims to minimize the number of reaction steps, prevent
the necessity of isolation of intermediate products, and improve the
“pot-economy” of the process.9 Using such a systems biocatalysis strategy, we have successfully
demonstrated a one-pot two-step biocatalytic cascade reaction for
the synthesis of the pharmaceutically relevant enantiomers of γ-nitrobutyric
acids starting from simple achiral precursors (acetaldehyde and nitroalkenes).
This synthetic route highlights a highly enantioselective carbon–carbon
bond-forming step catalyzed by a newly engineered artificial “Michaelase”,
4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A, which has no known biological counterpart. This
tailor-made enzyme shows non-natural substrate promiscuity, accepting
acetaldehyde for enantioselective addition to various nitroalkenes.
The modularity of this two-step cascade reaction was demonstrated
by using a previously engineered enantiocomplementary 4-OT mutant,
4-OT A33D,25 to synthesize the opposite
enantiomers of the γ-nitrobutyric acids. We also developed a
three-step chemoenzymatic cascade route for the conversion of enzymatically
prepared γ-nitrobutyric acids by chemical reduction into the
corresponding γ-aminobutyric acids in one pot. Given that the
efficient large-scale process for the manufacture of pregabalin (5a) by Pfizer is based on a lipase-catalyzed kinetic resolution
with ex situ enantiomer recycling,32 our
one-pot asymmetric chemoenzymatic cascade synthesis offers an alternative
route to pharmaceutically active γ-aminobutyric acid products,
as exemplified by the enantioselective synthesis of pregabalin (3
steps, 55% yield), phenibut (3 steps, 70% yield), baclofen (3 steps,
65% yield), and fluorophenibut (3 steps, 68% yield). This shows the
exciting opportunities available for combining chemocatalysts, natural
enzymes, and designed artificial biocatalysts in multistep syntheses.5 It is anticipated that such a rapid synthesis
strategy, which avoids (de)protecting steps and intermediate purifications,
could be flexibly extended to various other targets, for example by
using aldehyde donors with different chain length or by starting from
structurally distinct nitroalkenes.

The key step of the developed
cascade synthesis is the enantioselective
Michael addition of acetaldehyde to a nitroalkene catalyzed by an
engineered 4-OT variant (mutant L8Y/M45Y/F50A). The development of
this highly enantioselective 4-OT variant was achieved by using an
engineering strategy that involves simultaneous randomization at two
sites (Ile-2 and Leu-8, Figure 4) lining the substrate binding pocket of 4-OT M45Y/F50A, a
double mutant previously designed for inverting the stereoselectivity
to that required for GABA precursor synthesis.25 The major benefit of this structure-guided engineering
strategy lies in the reduction of the sequence space that has to be
covered in order to identify valuable mutants.28 Screening of 960 transformants, which is only a relatively
small fraction of clones with respect to statistical requirements
for significant coverage of possible combinations in a double-site
SSM library with NNK codons, yielded two quadruple mutants (I2W/L8Y/M45Y/F50A
and I2M/L8Y/M45Y/F50A) with significantly improved activity and the
desired high enantioselectivity. The best performing triple mutant,
L8Y/M45Y/F50A, was deductively constructed from these quadruple mutants.
Notably, this triple mutant must have been included in the double-site
SSM library, but apparently was not identified due to insufficient
screening. From this result it can be concluded that a single-site
SSM strategy at both positions would have been an even more efficient
engineering strategy, with only the need for screening of ∼200
transformants with acceptable statistical coverage of possible mutants.
In summary, we provide evidence that three amino acid substitutions
(L8Y/M45Y/F50A) are sufficient to invert and dramatically enhance
the enantioselectivity of 4-OT for the Michael addition of acetaldehyde
to various nitroalkenes.

A structural comparison of 4-OT M45Y/F50A
complexed with a nitroalkene
substrate25 and unliganded 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A
suggested that the new triple mutant has a narrower binding pocket
for the nitroalkene substrate (Figure 4). This reduction in size of the substrate binding
pocket may prevent the nitroalkene substrate to bind in two distinct
orientations relative to Pro-1, potentially explaining the enhanced
enantioselectivity. However, the possibility that the observed nitroalkene
substrate orientation is not relevant for the catalytic bond-forming
event cannot be excluded, because the covalent enzyme-bound enamine
intermediate, which is formed between Pro-1 and acetaldehyde,23 may influence the binding orientation of the
nitroalkene substrate and the trajectory of the nucleophilic addition.

The currently employed amounts (1.4–5.0 mol %) of 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A
are lower and reactions times of ≤30 min are generally shorter
than in the few conventional organocatalytic methodologies for identical
type of Michael reactions.12,33,34 Moreover, we take advantage of the water solubility of the enzyme
to achieve the reactions in environmentally friendly aqueous buffer
and not in organic solvent. Nevertheless, the relatively high amounts
of the 4-OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A enzyme employed, required to ensure short
reaction times to outcompete nonenzymatic water addition to nitroalkene
substrates 2a–d, might pose a possible
constraint on the use of our developed chemoenzymatic cascade synthesis
for large scale transformations. To address this issue, we currently
run protein engineering studies with the aim to further enhance the
unnatural “Michaelase” activities of 4 OT L8Y/M45Y/F50A,
which would allow lower catalyst loadings.

While all three steps
of the cascade reaction were performed under
aqueous conditions with high conversions, the chemical reduction step
requires 10 equiv of nickel boride and has to be performed at acidic
pH, which is not directly compatible with the enzymatic steps that
require neutral pH. It will be interesting to investigate whether
the chemical reduction step can be replaced by an enzymatic step,
converting the γ-nitrobutyric acids 4a–d into GABA analogues 5a–d. However, such an entirely enzymatic cascade route for the straightforward
synthesis of pharmaceutically active GABA analogues awaits the discovery
or engineering of an appropriate nitroreductase capable of completely
reducing the aliphatic nitro group of 4a–d to the amine group [at the expense of NAD(P)H] in a controlled
and efficient fashion, without formation of unstable, reactive intermediates
that lower the yield of the desired amino acid product. Although increasingly
investigated, reported nitroreductases prefer nitroaromatic substrates
and often catalyze only partial reduction of nitro groups to the reactive
nitroso or hydroxylamino products.29 We
have initiated studies aimed at exploring a large collection of putative
nitroreductases, as well as engineered variants thereof, for their
ability to efficiently reduce γ-nitrobutyric acids 4a–d into γ-aminobutyric acids 5a–d. As such, our work sets the stage for further
development of “artificial metabolisms” for the greener,
more sustainable and step-economic synthesis of an important class
of pharmaceuticals.
