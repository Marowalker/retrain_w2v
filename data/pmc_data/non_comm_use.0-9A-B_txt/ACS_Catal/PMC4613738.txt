Despite rapid advances in the field
of metal-free, “frustrated
Lewis pair” (FLP)-catalyzed hydrogenation, the need for strictly
anhydrous reaction conditions has hampered wide-scale uptake of this
methodology. Herein, we report that, despite the generally perceived
moisture sensitivity of FLPs, 1,4-dioxane solutions of B(C6F5)3 actually show appreciable moisture tolerance
and can catalyze hydrogenation of a range of weakly basic substrates
without the need for rigorously inert conditions. In particular, reactions
can be performed directly in commercially available nonanhydrous solvents
without subsequent drying or use of internal desiccants.

==== Body
With the advent of “frustrated
Lewis pair” (FLP) chemistry, metal-free catalytic hydrogenation
has managed to progress, in less than a decade, from the first example
of reversible metal-free H2 activation,1 into an established area of active research.2 In this remarkably short span of time, the substrate
scope of FLP hydrogenation methodologies (in which H2 is
activated through the cooperative action of a Lewis acid/base pair
precluded from forming a strong classical adduct) has expanded from
the initial basic imines and aziridines3 to include a wide variety of other functional groups,2 including heterocycles,4 simple alkenes, and alkynes,5 and most
recently, aldehydes and ketones.6

As FLP chemistry becomes more established, focus has inevitably
begun to shift from early, “proof-of-concept” studies
to the aim of developing more practical and widely applicable FLP
catalysts. To this end, recent reports have been seen emphasizing
the development of FLPs that can operate with low catalyst loadings,5a,7 or with high enantioselectivity.8 Despite
these advances, one factor that seriously limits the attractiveness
of the FLP catalysts reported to date is their extreme sensitivity
(and perceived sensitivity) to moisture9 (as well as many other functional groups),4,9,10 requiring these reagents to be
handled and employed under rigorously inert conditions through use
of gloveboxes and Schlenk lines. This lack of H2O tolerance
represents a significant practical barrier to the uptake of FLP catalysis
by the broader chemical community that must be overcome if FLPs are
truly to become viable alternatives to transition metal hydrogenation
catalysts.

Several attempts have been made to mitigate this
problem in recent
years. For example, we have reported the use of B(C6Cl5)(C6F5)211 as a bench-stable Lewis acid for FLP chemistry;12 however, this system still required the use
of rigorously dry reaction conditions (including freshly distilled,
anhydrous solvent) during catalytic hydrogenations. Separately, Ingleson
et al. have described the use of the N-methylacridinium
cation as a Lewis acid for FLP H2 activation in wet 1,2-dichlorobenzene,13 yet these reaction conditions were not extended
to subsequent hydrogenation catalysis. In addition, significant hydrolysis
(40%) was observed. More recently, Stephan et al. have reported an
FLP-catalyzed deoxygenation of aryl ketones and, although this reaction
produces H2O as a byproduct, the use of molecular sieves
as a reagent ensures that the reaction mixture remains strictly anhydrous.6c As such, the challenge of developing simple,
H2O-tolerant FLP catalytic systems remains an open one.14

The origins of FLPs’ moisture sensitivity
can be understood
by considering as an example the archetypal Lewis acid of FLP chemistry:
commercially available B(C6F5)3 (1). Because of its high Lewis acidity, complexation of H2O not only is strong, but also leads to significant Brønsted
acidification (the pKa of [1·OH2] has been found to be comparable to that of
HCl)15 and accordingly, deprotonation by
even moderately strong bases (including the amines and phosphines
typically employed in FLP chemistry) is irreversible. Under more forcing
conditions, the adduct [1·OH2] is also
prone to decomposition via B–C bond protonolysis (Scheme 1).16

Scheme 1 Pathways for Deactivation of 1 by H2O
Recently, we6a and Stephan et al.6b have independently reported the hydrogenation
of ketones and aldehydes to alcohols, catalyzed by 1 in
ethereal solvents (Scheme 2). These reactions are clearly tolerant of hydroxylic functionalities,
which is attributed to the weak Brønsted basicity of the ethers
employed, which inhibits irreversible deprotonation of the highly
acidic [1·ROH] adducts.

Scheme 2 Previously-Reported
Hydrogenation of Aldehydes and Ketones Catalyzed

R = aryl, alkyl; R′
= alkyl, H.

Following on from these results,
we reasoned that these systems
might also be capable of tolerating the presence of H2O,
for similar reasons, which would represent an important advance for
the field of FLP chemistry. Initial investigations focused on the
hydrogenation of acetone (the simplest substrate previously examined
under anhydrous conditions). Gratifyingly, when 1 was
replaced with the preformed adduct 1·OH215 under identical conditions, selective
hydrogenation to 2-propanol was observed to proceed cleanly and with
good turnover number (Table 1, entry 2). Although the rate of reaction is reduced (c.f. Table 1, entry 1), confirming
that H2O acts as a significant catalyst poison, inhibition
by H2O is nonetheless clearly reversible. At the time,
this represented the first example of an FLP-catalyzed hydrogenation
that is tolerant of stoichiometric (relative to catalyst) H2O.

Increasing the H2 pressure led to a significant
rate
enhancement, even at lower catalyst loadings (Table 1, entry 3) and without any detectable catalyst
decomposition (ascertained by 19F and 11B NMR
spectroscopy). Under these conditions, several more equivalents of
H2O could be tolerated, with an attendant decrease in rate
yet otherwise no major difference in reaction outcome (Table 1, entries 4 and 5).

On the basis of the ability of this system to tolerate
multiple
equivalents of water, we reasoned that the use of “undried”
solvents ought to be achievable; impressively, the reaction could
be performed very effectively in nonanhydrous commercial solvent17even without any need for subsequent
drying, degassing, or other purification. Furthermore, doubling
the substrate and catalyst concentrations allowed for a significant
decrease in reaction time (Table 1, entry 6).

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism for Moisture-Tolerant
Hydrogenation of Acetone
Possible hydrogen
bonding
of solvent with [1·ROH] and [1·OH2] omitted for clarity.

The mechanism
by which the hydrogenation is believed to occur is
identical to that proposed for the anhydrous reaction, with [1·OH2] acting as an off-cycle resting state
(Scheme 3).18 As with previously observed alcohol tolerance,
H2O tolerance is attributed to the lack of any strong base,
meaning irreversible deprotonation of [1·OH2] does not occur (c.f. Scheme 1). Even so, it seems possible that reversible deprotonation does occur, which could be consistent with the acidity
of this adduct (vide supra).19 Evidence
for deprotonation comes from 11B NMR spectroscopy: although
[1·OH2] alone shows an 11B
NMR resonance at 4.6 ppm in the noncoordinating yet highly polar solvent
1,2-difluorobenzene (DFB), addition of 1,4-dioxane leads to a clear
upfield shift, to −0.6 ppm with 1 equiv of ethereal base, and
−2.1 ppm with 10 equiv (Figure 1).20 Typical nonanhydrous
reaction mixtures, which contain [1·OH2] in neat 1,4-dioxane, produce resonances farther
upfield still, at −3.0 ppm. For comparison, the 11B NMR shift of [NMe4][1·OH], which contains
the “free” conjugate base of [1·OH2], has been reported as −2.1 ppm in CD2Cl2, with similar shifts for related salts.211H NMR analysis also suggests an interaction
between [1·OH2] and 1,4-dioxane, with
the 1,4-dioxane resonance shifted slightly downfield, from 3.56 ppm
in the absence of [1·OH2], to 3.59 ppm
in the presence of 1 equiv, indicating overall deshielding. Although
displacement of H2O for 1,4-dioxane could also potentially
explain these shifts in the NMR spectra, this possibility can be discounted:
addition of 1 and 10 equiv of 1,4-dioxane to dry1 in DFB leads to 11B NMR resonances at 9.8 and
5.7 ppm, respectively, and 1,4-dioxane 1H resonances at
3.96 and 3.59 ppm, respectively; in all cases significantly farther
downfield than when H2O is also present.

Figure 1 Variation in 11B NMR chemical shift of [1·OH2] upon
addition of 1,4-dioxane in DFB.

Reversible deprotonation of [1·OH2] and the related [1·ROH] adducts may partially
explain the large effect that pressure has been observed to have on
both the anhydrous and nonanhydrous reactions. Increasing H2 pressure will increase the solution concentration of H2 and, in turn, the degree of H2 activation. The resulting
increase in Brønsted acid concentration should perturb the equilibrium
between [1·OH2]/[1·iPrOH] and [1·OH]−/[1·OiPr] – in favor
of the more weakly bound neutral adducts, hence facilitating catalytic
turnover via ROH/H2O dissociation from 1.

Given that the rationale for H2O tolerance
in this system
depends primarily on the absence of a strong base, it seemed reasonable
that catalytic hydrogenation without the need for rigorously dry conditions
might also be achievable for other weakly basic substrates. To this
end, a variety of additional substrates (both carbonyls and noncarbonyls)
were treated under similar conditions. For most, clean, efficient
catalytic reduction was observed without the need for extensive further
optimization (Table 2, entries 1–7), clearly indicating the generality of this
water-tolerant methodology. As well as using undried solvent, reactions
could be performed under open bench conditions without the need for
inert atmosphere containment systems22 (although
long-term storage of 1 is best carried out in a glovebox).
By contrast, the attempted reduction of cyclohexanone under the same
conditions was unsuccessful (Table 2, entry 8), which is qualitatively consistent with
previous observations made under dry conditions,6a for which higher pressures were required for hydrogenation
than for the other carbonyl substrates. Collectively, these results
suggest a similar substrate scope for the anhydrous and nonanhydrous
reaction protocols.

In addition to the advantages already discussed,
moisture-tolerance
should also allow FLPs to catalyze reactions that produce H2O. To this end, acetophenone was exposed to our anhydrous
reaction conditions. Clean, catalytic reductive deoxygenation to ethylbenzene23 was observed, despite the concomitant formation
of H2O (5 equiv relative to catalyst) that necessarily
occurs (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Hydrogenation of Acetophenone to Ethylbenzene and H2O
Catalyzed by 1
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a number of examples
of FLP-catalyzed
hydrogenation reactions demonstrating appreciable water tolerance.
As a result, a variety of weakly basic substrates can be hydrogenated
cleanly and in high yield, in the absence of a transition metal catalyst,
in commercial-grade “bench” (undried) solvents. By removing
the need for both extensive, laborious drying of reaction solvents
and inert atmosphere reaction techniques, this development significantly
increases the practicality of the FLP hydrogenation methodology. These
findings extend the current reach of FLP hydrogenation catalysis from
rigorously anhydrous research laboratory conditions into industrially
relevant, commercially available solvent grades and reaction conditions.

While this manuscript was under review, Soós
et al. reported a moisture-tolerant protocol for FLP-catalysed hydrogenation
of aldehydes and ketones using novel boranes specifically designed
for that purpose. Their approach (targeted design of new catalysts,
rather than adaptation of existing FLP hydrogenation protocols) complements
the work reported herein.

ACS reagent grade 1,4-dioxane purchased from
Sigma Aldrich was used. Karl Fischer titration indicated 220 ppm/0.022%
H2O (w/w) (advertised as up to 0.05%).


We propose that 1,4-dioxane acts as the main
base for hydrogen activation due to the vast excess (12 M) in which
it is present; however, in principle, this role could also be played
by water or 2-propanol.


The pKa of protonated
1,4-dioxane has been measured as −2.92
in aqueous solution. Although the aqueous pKa of [1·OH2] has
not been measured,15 our results indicate
that it may be comparable. See:

It should be noted that these observations
could also be consistent with strong hydrogen bonding to the solvent
rather than full formal deprotonation; in practice, the true situation
might be expected to lie somewhere between these two extremes.

NMR analysis of an aliquot
taken at partial conversion showed formation of styrene (in addition
to ethylbenzene and the expected alcohol intermediate), which is consistent
with previous observations made at lower pressure.6a At completion, only ethylbenzene was observed, however,
indicating that the alkene undergoes further reduction (either directly,
or via rehydration to the alcohol).
