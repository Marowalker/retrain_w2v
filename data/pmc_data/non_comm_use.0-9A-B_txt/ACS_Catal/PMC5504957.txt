Molecular-sized
micropores of ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts provide spatial
restrictions around catalytic sites that allow for shape-selective
catalysis. However, the fact that ZSM-5 has two main pore systems
with different geometries is relatively unexploited as a potential
source of additional shape selectivity. Here, we use confocal laser-scanning
microscopy to show that by changing the polarity of the solvent, the
acid-catalyzed furfuryl alcohol oligomerization can be directed to
selectively occur within either of two locations in the microporous
network. This finding is confirmed for H-ZSM-5 particles with different
Si/Al ratios and indicates a general trend for shape-selective catalytic
reactions.

==== Body
Zeolites are the most commonly
used heterogeneous catalysts in the (petro)chemical industry.1−3 Since the middle of the 20th century, they have been extensively
studied and applied in industrial processes because of their unique
combination of extensive microporosity and the intrinsic strong acidity
of their hydrogen form. This combination enables them to achieve both
high catalytic activity and high chemical selectivity.

One of
the most important and widely used types of zeolite catalysts
is the hydrogen form of ZSM-5 (MFI framework type). H-ZSM-5 is industrially
used in fluid catalytic cracking,4 the
synthesis of ethylbenzene,5,6 the isomerization of
xylenes,6 and the disproportionation of
toluene.6,7 Also, it is often looked upon as the prototype
of a shape-selective catalysts because of its high para-selectivity
toward the alkylation of alkylbenzenes.3 More recently, with a focus on environmentally sustainable processes,
there were numerous and promising studies regarding the activity and
shape selectivity of H-ZSM-5 in the catalytic conversion of biomass
and its derivatives.8−11 For example, it was shown that ZSM-5 exhibited the highest aromatic
yield and the least amount of coking among 13 zeolites with different
pore sizes and shapes when applied in the fast catalytic pyrolysis
of glucose.8

The MFI framework consists
of two types of intersecting 10-membered-ring
pores. The geometry and size of these perpendicular pores differ:
one type consists of straight channels with a size of 5.3 × 5.6
Å2, running along the crystallographic b-axis, the other has a tortuous shape, commonly referred to as the
sinusoidal channels, with a size of 5.1 × 5.5 Å2, running along the crystallographic a-axis.12,13 Such differences in pore size and local environment can trigger
different adsorption properties between the two types of pores. For
example, it has been shown that aromatic molecules, such as p-xylene, p-dichlorobenzene, and trans-stilbene, preferentially adsorb at different locations
of the framework depending not only on the adsorbate nature but also
on the adsorbate loading.14−19 Techniques such as single-crystal X-ray diffraction and high-resolution
synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction showed that at low loadings,
the adsorbate molecules are preferentially located inside in the straight
pores of ZSM-5 crystals,14−16 whereas at high loadings, they
accumulate at pore intersections and in the sinusoidal pores.18,19 In addition, Eckman et al. used deuterium solid-state NMR to trace
temperature-dependent changes in orientation of p-xylene molecules in H-ZSM-5 at low loadings. They concluded that
molecules are neither able to move from the straight channels into
the sinusoidal channels nor move along the sinusoidal channels.17

Such differences in molecular adsorption
and transport should influence
the catalytic processes. However, given the increased complexity of
the chemical reaction system compared with adsorption and diffusion,
it has proven to be not straightforward to study the molecular orientation
during catalytic conversions inside zeolite crystals. Luckily, catalysis
characterization has benefitted from the development and application
of powerful microscopy techniques in recent years, such as fluorescence
and optical microspectroscopy.20,21 They allow the monitoring
of molecular processes inside a single catalyst crystal, for example,
to determine the exact location of catalytic conversions. Additionally,
they can resolve the orientation of reaction products with respect
to the crystalline porous network by using linearly polarized excitation
light. These techniques were successfully applied to study H-ZSM-5
catalysts and their activity where other microscopic techniques failed.
For example, the early attempt to use polarized Fourier-transform
infrared microscopy to study the location of adsorbates in single
ZSM-5 crystals was hampered by crystal twinning or intergrowth, which
could not be resolved by infrared microscopy.22 Later on, numerous fluorescence, optical and electron microscopic
investigations discerned the intergrowth structure of ZSM-5 crystals
and the crystallographic orientation of the subcrystal units.23−28

In the case of the ZSM-5 crystals used in this study, a pronounced
intergrowth is present in the main body of the coffin-shaped H-ZSM-5
particles (Figure 1a). Such 90 deg intergrowths are commonly observed in ZSM-5 crystals
and were previously also observed in this specific sample.26,28 The crystallographic c-axis aligns with the longest
particle dimension both for the main crystal body and the intergrowth.
However, in the intergrowth (pink area in Figure 1a) the crystallographic a- and b-axes are rotated 90° around the c-axis with respect to the main crystal body (blue area
in Figure 1a). As a
consequence, the orientation of the straight and sinusoidal pores
is swapped between the main body and the intergrowth of the crystal.
This property can be exploited to reveal differences in reactivity
between the two pore structures, as the orientation of the acid-catalyzed
reaction products can be identified by using linear polarized excitation
light (see below). Because pore systems are oriented perpendicularly
to each other, differences in reactivity should be easy to identify.

fluorescence microscopy approach. The green two-headed arrow indicates
the orientation of the applied light polarization.

As mentioned earlier, it has been described in
the literature that
the pore preference of p-dichlorobenzene depends
on the adsorbate loading.14,18 On this basis, we speculated
that it should be possible to affect the pore preference of the catalytic
reaction and direct the reaction to predominantly happen in one of
both pore types. Numerous microspectroscopic studies have been conducted
in the past to investigate the factors affecting catalytic activity
of H-ZSM-5, such as its relation with the subcrystalline intergrowth
structure,24−26,29−33 the effect of commonly applied steaming treatments,34,35 the mechanisms of coke formation,36 and
the solvent effect.37 In particular, the
choice of solvent has been shown to significantly affect the catalytic
activity of H-ZSM-5 crystals in the styrene dimerization reaction,
as solvents with a different polarity interact differently with zeolite
Brønsted acid sites.37 On the basis
of these considerations, we hypothesized that by using different solvents
the pore preference of a catalytic reaction could also be affected.

In this work, this hypothesis was investigated by comparing the
effect of a polar solvent, water, to that of the more apolar, 1,4-dioxane.
Earlier, both of these solvents were shown to be appropriate to study
acid zeolite catalysis with our chosen probe reaction (i.e., the furfuryl
alcohol oligomerization),24,38 but they differ significantly
in polarity (spectroscopic polarity indices are 1.000 for water, 0.164
for 1,4-dioxane, and 0.605 for furfuryl alcohol).39

We applied the furfuryl
alcohol oligomerization as model reaction
(Figure 1b) which catalytically
stains zeolite crystals with fluorescent products. Subsequently, confocal
laser-scanning (CLS) microscopy detects these fluorescent reaction
products, enabling a differentiation between zones within single H-ZSM-5
crystals based on their catalytic performance (Figure 1b). The molecular orientation of the fluorescent
reaction products, and therefore the type of pore in which they are
formed, was revealed using linearly polarized excitation light. Under
these conditions, only fluorescent species with their dipole moment
oriented along the polarization direction of the incident light (indicated
by the green two-headed arrow on the figures) are efficiently excited.

In our experiments, we used four H-ZSM-5 samples with experimentally
determined Si/Al ratios of 880, 82, 75, and 27, respectively, designated
H-ZSM-5-880, H-ZSM-5-82, H-ZSM-5-75, and H-ZSM-5-27. In the main article,
we present experimental data related only to the H-ZSM-5-880 sample,
whereas the results for other samples are given in the Supporting Information.

The CLS micrographs
of the catalytically stained H-ZSM-5–880
crystals lying on their [010] plane surfaces (based on the crystallographic
structure of the main body) are presented in Figure 2. In this orientation, the main crystal body
has sinusoidal pores running parallel compared to the excitation light
polarization orientation, while its straight pores run perpendicular
to the presented image plane and lie along the direction of the light
propagation. In the intergrowth, the opposite is true—the straight
pores are coaligned with the excitation light polarization orientation,
while the sinusoidal pores lie along the line of observation. We observed
that fluorescent molecules are accumulated in the straight pores of
the intergrowth when water is used as solvent, whereas reactions take
place in the sinusoidal pores in the main body of the crystal in 1,4-dioxane.
We conclude that, in line with our expectations, the type of pores
in which the reaction takes place can be controlled on the basis of
the solvent.

Figure 2 CLS micrographs of furfuryl alcohol oligomers accumulated
at different
depths within H-ZSM-5–880 crystals (lying on the [010] facet)
using water (left) or 1,4-dioxane (right) as a solvent. Transmission
image is presented from the 1,4-dioxane-based experiment. False color
scale shows the observed fluorescence intensity adjusted for each
slide; the green two-headed arrow indicates the excitation light polarization
orientation; scale bar: 20 μm.

However, it is possible that our observations highlight differences
in activity between the intergrowth and main body of the crystal,
rather than between the straight and sinusoidal pores. In order to
confirm our results, we have conducted CLS microscopic imaging of
crystals lying on their [100] facet (based on the crystallographic
structure of the main body). In this orientation, the straight pores
of the main body and sinusoidal pores of the intergrowth are coaligned
with the excitation light polarization orientation. The micrographs
presented in Figure 3 confirm that without regard to main body or intergrowth 1,4-dioxane
promotes catalytic activity in sinusoidal pores, whereas water promotes
the reaction to occur mainly in the straight pores.

Figure 3 CLS micrographs of furfuryl
alcohol oligomers accumulated at different
depths within H-ZSM-5-880 crystals (lying on the [100] facet) using
water (left) or 1,4-dioxane (right) as a solvent. Transmission image
is presented from the 1,4-dioxane based experiment. False color scale
shows the observed fluorescence intensity adjusted for each slide;
the green two-headed arrow indicates the excitation light polarization
orientation; scale bar: 20 μm.

We observed the same effect in two other batches: H-ZSM-5-82
and
H-ZSM-5-27 (Figures S1–S4). H-ZSM-5-75
showed a slightly deviating picture. While the reaction is also highly
favored in the straight pores when using water as a solvent, the product
formation shows a weak preference toward the straight pores as well
when 1,4-dioxane is used (Figures S5–S6).

A possible explanation for the observed solvent-dependent
pore
preference may be sought in the differences in solvent polarity and
its interaction with the zeolite pores of different polarity. Pore
polarity differences can be caused by (1) the uneven distribution
of framework aluminum and the associated acid sites or (2) by differences
in defect silanols in straight versus sinusoidal pores. As the pore
preference effect appears to be independent of the Si/Al ratio and
is even observed in Al-poor H-ZSM-5-880 sample, we rule out that framework
aluminum distribution is the main cause for polarity differences.
To investigate the possibility of silanol groups affecting pore polarity,
we have conducted 1H MAS NMR investigation of H-ZSM-5-880
(Supporting Information and Figures S8–S10),40 which
revealed an estimated minimal concentration of silanol groups as Si/SiOH
ratio of 82. The actual silanol concentration is even higher as even
in the calcined sample traces of water were present; water in exchange
with silanols decreases the detected silanol signal. This concentration
of silanols is in line with earlier reports.41,42 Controlled addition of water shows the strong interaction with these
silanols indicative for a high local polarity. From these 1H MAS NMR data in combination with the CLS microscopy observations
we conclude that there is a silanol-induced polarity, which is potentially
different between the sinusoidal and straight pores with silanols
being preferentially present in the sinusoidal pores. Hence, the enhanced
polarity of the sinusoidal pores compared with the straight pores
can lead to differences in the respective coadsorption dynamics for
solvent-furfuryl alcohol systems: the more polar molecules in the
system will preferentially adsorb in the sinusoidal pores and the
more apolar in the straight pores. This preferential molecular absorption
was further confirmed by the distribution of the apolar benzonitrile
molecules, which are preferentially adsorbed along the straight pores
of the H-ZSM-5-880 as revealed by stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
microscopy (Figure S11).

To further
support this model that the acid catalysis in ZSM-5
is strongly influenced by differences in pore polarity and the preferential
molecular adsorption, we tested another apolar solvent 2-butanone,
similar in polarity to 1,4-dioxane. With a spectroscopic polarity
index of 0.327, 2-butanone is more apolar than furfuryl alcohol.39 The results of these experiments are presented
in Figure 4. The measured
catalytic activity patterns confirm that the activity is mostly restricted
to sinusoidal pores of H-ZSM-5, similar to the reaction in 1,4-dioxane
and opposite to what is observed in water. These results support our
proposed model that the observed solvent-induced pore preference is
indeed guided by the solvent polarity and the related molecular adsorption
based on pore polarity.

Figure 4 CLS micrographs of furfuryl alcohol oligomers
accumulated at different
depths within H-ZSM-5-880 crystals lying on the [100] (left) and [010]
(right) facet using 2-butanone as a solvent. False color scale shows
the observed fluorescence intensity adjusted for each slide; the green
two-headed arrow indicates the excitation light polarization orientation;
scale bar: 20 μm.

In conclusion, the presented work shows that differences
in solvent
and reagent polarity can be employed to steer the catalytic activity
toward the straight or sinusoidal pores in H-ZSM-5. This effect is
likely related to the intrinsic presence of silanol defects. CLS microscopy
in combination with furfuryl alcohol oligomerization as probe reaction
shows that this acid catalyzed reaction preferentially occurs in the
straight pores of H-ZSM-5 crystals if water is used as solvent and
in the sinusoidal pores if the more apolar 1,4-dioxane or 2-butanone
are used. Additional 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy and SRS microscopy
with probe molecules support the proposed model, which relates the
observed pore preference to a difference in polarity between straight
and sinusoidal pores as result of silanol defects.
