The
development of orthogonal Csp2–Csp2 coupling regimes to the omnipresent Pd-catalysis
class would enable an additional dimension of modularity in the construction
of densely functionalized biaryl motifs. In this context, the identification
of potent functional groups for selective transformations is in high
demand. Although organogermanium compounds are generally believed
to be of low reactivity in homogenous catalysis, this report discloses
the highly efficient and orthogonal reactivity of aryl germanes with
arenes under gold catalysis. The method is characterized by mildness,
the employment of an air- and moisture-stable gold catalyst, and robustness.
Our mechanistic studies show that aryl germanes are highly reactive
with Au(I) and Au(III). Our computational data
suggest that the origin of this reactivity primarily lies in the relatively
low bond dissociation energy and as such low distortion energy to
reach the key bond activating transition state.

==== Body
Owing to its
ubiquitous presence in natural products, pharmaceuticals, and materials,1 the biaryl motif is ideally constructed in a
modular and diversifiable synthetic approach, as this would maximize
opportunities for further functionalizations. Although Pd-catalyzed
cross-coupling reactions of aryl halides with aryl boronic acids/esters,
silanes, stannanes, or organometallic reagents are most widely applied
to construct Csp2–Csp2 bonds,2 a key requirement to maximize
diversity is the ability to selectively and sequentially couple at
one site over all alternatives, for example, in polyhalogenated arenes.
Although significant progress has been made in this direction,3 another powerful strategy would be to devise
completely orthogonal Csp2–Csp2 bond-forming methodology that would not interfere with
those functionalities that are so valuable in the established Pd-catalysis
regime (see Figure 1). Ideally, the strategy also minimizes the requirement for prefunctionalization
of arenes and allows for direct C–H arylation.4 In this context, gold-catalyzed C–C coupling strategies
are highly promising.5 Lloyd-Jones and
co-workers pioneered that biaryls can be formed under gold catalysis
via coupling of aryl silanes with Ar–H bonds while tolerating
aryl halides (Figure 1).6,7 Detailed mechanistic investigations showed that the
employed Au(I) catalyst is initially oxidized to a highly
reactive noncoordinated Au(III). The Au(III) then activates the aryl silane (ArSiR3), followed by
activation of Ar–H.8 Larrosa recently
widened the mechanistic and synthetic repertoire and showed the direct
C–H coupling of perfluorinated arenes with highly electronically
activated arenes (with the help of silver).9 Nevado and co-workers demonstrated the coupling of electron-deficient
polyfluorinated aryl boronic ester derivatives (ArBPin) with Ar–H
at elevated temperatures (>130 °C).10 The ArBPin was found to also be activated at Au(I) (potentially
forming Au(I)–Ar prior to oxidation to the Au(III) intermediate).5 Given that
ArSiR3 and ArBPin are valuable functionalities also for
numerous other bond formations,1,2 for example, halogenation,
amination, or Pd-catalyzed carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom
bond formation, and as such are powerful handles for downstream follow-up
decorations of biaryl motifs, we set out to identify potential alternatives
with a view to maximize modularity and synthetic diversity. As part
of our program in chemoselective functionalizations,3,11 we initially embarked on understanding the factors that dictate
the reactivities in the activation of ArSiR3 by Au(III) and calculated the crucial transition state. We studied
an electrophilic aromatic substitution-type reactivity, as suggested
by Lloyd-Jones for ArSiR3, with [Au(III)(OMs)3] as model complex.12,13 The key bond activation
is illustrated in Figure 2a; a Wheland-type intermediate was found to initially form,
which then proceeds to Ar–Si bond scission. We also further
analyzed the key components that dictate this step, and performed
a distortion/interaction analysis, comparing the energies of geometrically
distorted fragments of the transition-state structure with the corresponding
structures of the preceding intermediate.14 Interestingly, although the total distortion and interaction energies
are of similarly high magnitude, the distortion energy originates
nearly exclusively from the Ar–Si bending and stretching (ΔEDist. = 51.7 kcal mol–1),
whereas the Au(III) essentially remains geometrically unchanged
(ΔEDist. = 0.1 kcal mol–1).

tool for orthogonal diversification.

and experimental investigation of bond activation of ArSiMe3 and ArGeEt3 with Au(III). Transition-state
barriers were computed at the CPCM (dioxane) M06L/6-311++G(d,p)//ωB97XD/6-31G(d)
[with LANL2DZ for Au] level of theory. For computational and experimental
details, see the Supporting Information.12 OCSA = camphorsulfonate.

Given that distortion energy usually roughly correlates with
homolytic bond dissociation energies (i.e., bond strength, BDE),15 we envisioned that a reaction partner with lower
BDE, but similar interaction capability might be an excellent match
for the reactivity requirements of gold.

We therefore targeted
organogermanium compounds, which are characterized by lower BDEs (ΔHBDE = 94.9 kcal mol–1 for
Ph-SiMe3 and 85.2 kcal mol–1 for Ph-GeMe3).16 Moreover, the few articles
that appeared in the context of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl
halides with organogermaniums as coupling partners concluded that
they are of relatively low reactivity, and certainly inferior relative
to established alternatives (e.g., aryl boronic acids, -stannanes,
or organometallic reagents),17 which constitutes
an advantageous feature for our goal of devising a fully orthogonal
biaryl coupling system. Interestingly, our computational examination
of Ar-GeMe3 activation by Au(III) indeed predicted
a roughly 70% lower barrier than for aryl silanes (Figure 2b).

Encouraged by these
data, we set out to experimentally examine the reactivity of aryl
germanes with Au(III). To the best of our knowledge, there
is no precedence nor knowledge of the reactivity of aryl germanes
with gold (neither stoichiometric nor catalytic). ArGeEt3 are readily accessible by reaction of aryl Grignard reagents with
commercially available Et3GeCl. We chose the air- and moisture-stable
and nontoxic PhGeEt3 for our studies and tested its stoichiometric
reactivity with various Au(III) sources (see Figure 2c). Although AuBr3 or Au(OAc)3 did not lead to marked reactivity, there
was complete consumption of PhGeEt31 with
[Au(III)(OCSA)3] (OCSA; formed in situ) at room
temperature. As such, Ar–Ge activation by gold is indeed feasible,
provided there are noncoordinating counterions at gold.

With
this novel reactivity finding made, we set out to examine whether
catalysis and C–H functionalization is also feasible with aryl
germanes. Building on Lloyd-Jones conditions as a starting point,6a which involve the use of 2 mol % [(Ph3P)Au(I)(OTs)] as the catalyst and PhI(OAc)2 and camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) to form the oxidant PhI(OCSA)2 in situ, we tested the reactivity of aryl germane 1 with 2-bromoanisol in CHCl3/MeOH (50:1). To our delight,
the desired biaryl 9 was obtained in 84% yield at room
temperature within 36 h.

Upon further investigation, we found
that the aryl germanes are also efficiently catalyzed with commercially
available gold chloride, [(Ph3P)AuCl], and 1,4-dioxane
as a convenient, nonprotic solvent. We subsequently set out to explore
these new conditions for a wider range of arenes and aryl germanes.
Pleasingly, the C–H functionalization proceeded in a selective
manner for a variety of substrates of different substitution patterns
and steric hindrance (see Table 1). Although we saw complete conversion at room temperature,
heating at 70 °C allowed for significantly shorter reaction times.
Sterically demanding ortho, ortho-disubstitution on ArH (3, 4, and 8) was just as well tolerated
as aryl halides (9–11, 13–19). The method was compatible with iodides, bromides, and chlorides
on both the ArH (e.g. 10, 13, 14) and ArGeR3 (15–19) reaction partners.
These carbon–halogen bonds constitute powerful synthetic handles
for further selective functionalization.3 Similarly, the pharmaceutically and agrochemically important fluorine
and trifluoromethyl group (8) were well tolerated. Ar–F
in principle offers another diversification possibility through modern
Ni-catalyzed or base-mediated coupling strategies.18

Other functional groups, such as the TBDMS-protected
phenol 20 and pharmaceutically relevant heterocycles
(i.e., xanthene 23) could be tolerated under the applied
reaction conditions (Table 1). Moreover, thiazole 24, derivatives of which
have been reported to exhibit physiological activity as COX-1 inhibitors,19 was similarly formed in high yield, showcasing
the applicability of this methodology in the synthesis of high-value
biaryl motifs. Notably, aryl silanes were previously shown to display
excellent functional group tolerance in such biaryl syntheses;6a the scope with aryl germanes is similar. As
all reaction components, including the employed catalyst [(Ph3P)AuCl], are air- and moisture-stable, we also tested the
reaction to make hindered biaryl 8 open to air. We saw
essentially the identical reaction outcome as under exclusion of oxygen,
suggesting that just like for silanes,6a,8 the gold-catalyzed
coupling of aryl germanes is tolerant to oxygen and moisture also.

We next investigated the relative reactivity of ArGeR3 compared to ArBpin or ArSiR3 under our reaction conditions.
It has previously been shown that the relative reactivity of ArSi
versus ArBR can in principle be modulated through appropriate modification
of conditions.10 Intermolecular competition
experiments under our catalysis conditions gave full consumption of
ArGeEt3 (25), whereas ArSiMe3 (26) and ArBpin (27) were fully recovered after
12 h (Figure 3),20 in accord with the observed relative speed of
conversion over time ArGe > ArSi ≫ ArBR (see Figure 3a).21

Figure 3 ArGeEt3, under these conditions most reactive site compared to ArSiMe3 and ArB(pin). Standard conditions: [(Ph3P)Au][Cl]
(5.0 mol %), PhI(OAc)2 (1.5 equiv), CSA (1.5 equiv) in
1,4-dioxane (0.3 M) at 70 °C. Quantification by 19F NMR analysis.

There was no induction
period; the aryl germane is consumed from the beginning and transformed
to the biaryl product in a relatively rapid fashion (see Figure 3). Given the observed
high reactivity with Au(III), we wondered about the feasibility
of aryl germanes to potentially also react with the less activated
oxidation state (I) of gold. Eventually this might offer additional
opportunities and flexibility for catalysis developments in terms
of employed oxidants and conditions, being less dependent on the relative
kinetics of oxidation versus transmetalation. Aryl silanes were previously
shown to be unreactive with Au(I),8 whereas ArBPin is reactive with Au(I) as long as acetate
is present as counterion to the gold cation.10,22

Pleasingly, we found that subjecting aryl germane 28 to [(Ph3P)Au(I)(OMs)] at room temperature
resulted in full consumption of 28 (see Figure 4), showcasing that aryl germanes—although
no ideal partner in homogeneous Pd(0)/Pd(II) catalysis—are an optimal match for gold (Figure 4). In line with these findings,
our DFT studies suggest a relatively facile activation by [(PPh3)Au(I)OMs]. A ΔΔG⧧ = 8.8 kcal mol–1 lower activation
free-energy barrier was calculated for PhGeMe3 than for
PhSiMe3, in line with the experimental observations that
showed no bond activation with silanes.23

and experimental investigation of bond activation of ArGeEt3 with Au(I). Energies calculated at the CPCM (dioxane)
M06L/6-311++G(d,p)//ωB97XD/6-31G(d) [LANL2DZ for Au] level of
theory.

Our further studies revealed that
aryl germanes undergo activation with a variety of Au(I) complexes, as long as the counterion of gold is noncoordinating:
[(Ph3P)Au(I)][X] with X = OTf or BF4 were all found to efficiently react with Ar-GeR328 (see Figure 4 and the Supporting Information for details).
By contrast, the bond activation of boronic ester derivatives on Au(I)
proceeds exclusively with the OAc– counterion; other boronic
acid derivatives typically require OH– or F– counterions.10,23,24 Ultimately, in catalysis, the
employed oxidant will end up as counterion on Au(I). As
such, the tolerance of different counterions might offer possibilities
to develop and employ different catalysis conditions to modulate selectivity
and/or substrate scope.

In conclusion, aryl germane—long
thought to be of low reactivity in catalysis and C–C coupling
reactions—presents itself as a versatile, nontoxic, air- and
moisture stable reaction partner in gold-catalyzed couplings with
arenes. As opposed to silanes, aryl germanes are reactive with both
Au(I) and Au(III), much like the corresponding
boron reagents, albeit under milder conditions and with different
gold counterions. Our computational studies identified relatively
low distortion energy as a consequence of the lower BDE as the primary
origin of high reactivity of aryl germanes with gold, allowing for
efficient couplings with arenes and offering a new reactivity mode
in the toolbox of selectivity and cross coupling.

The resulting mass balance in the presence
of ArB(pin) amounts to homocoupling of ArGeEt3.


For direct comparison of the reactivity
of aryl germanes, we performed C–H functionalization employing
the reaction conditions developed by Lloyd-Jones and co-workers for
aryl silanes and the reaction conditions developed by Nevado and co-workers
for boronic esters. While Lloyd-Jones’ conditions for aryl
germanes yielded 84% of the desired product, Nevado’s conditions
were not efficient for aryl germanes and yielded just 11% of the desired
biaryl product. See Supporting Information for experimental details.
