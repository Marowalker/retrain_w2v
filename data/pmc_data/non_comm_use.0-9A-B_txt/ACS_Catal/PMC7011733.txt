Covalent
triazine-based frameworks (CTFs), a group of semiconductive
polymers, have been identified for photocatalytic water splitting
recently. Their adjustable band gap and facile processing offer great
potential for discovery and development. Here, we present a series
of CTF-0 materials fabricated by two different approaches, a microwave-assisted
synthesis and an ionothermal method, for water splitting driven by
visible-light irradiation. The material (CTF-0-M2) synthesized
by microwave technology shows a high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen
evolution (up to 7010 μmol h–1 g–1), which is 7 times higher than another (CTF-0-I) prepared by conventional
ionothermal trimerization under identical photocatalytic conditions.
This leads to a high turnover number (TON) of 726 with respect to
the platinum cocatalyst after seven cycles under visible light. We
attribute this to the narrowed band gap, the most negative conduction
band, and the rapid photogenerated charge separation and transfer.
On the other hand, the material prepared by the ionothermal method
is the most efficient one for oxygen evolution. CTF-0-I initially
produces ca. 6 times greater volumes of oxygen gas than CTF-0-M2 under identical experimental conditions. CTF-0-I presents
an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 5.2% at 420 nm for oxygen
production without any cocatalyst. The activity for water oxidation
exceeds that of most reported CTFs due to a large driving force for
oxidation and a large number of active sites. Our findings indicate
that the band positions and the interlayer stacking structures of
CTF-0 were modulated by varying synthesis conditions. These modulations
impact the optical and redox properties, resulting in an enhanced
performance for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution, confirmed
by first-principles calculations.

1 Introduction
Conversion
of simple molecules into chemical fuels by artificial
photosynthesis via solar energy is an environmentally friendly way
of producing clean sustainable power and to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions.1 More specifically, visible-light-driven
water splitting into O2 and H2 by photocatalysis
shows promising potential to realize solar-to-chemical energy conversion
in practice.2 For overall water splitting,
single semiconductor photocatalysts have been reported to generate
hydrogen and oxygen successfully and simultaneously from water under
light illumination in a suspension system.3 However, the highest quantum efficiency of a single photocatalyst
for overall water splitting has been reported to be 2.5% at 420–440
nm on (Ga1–xZnx)(N1–xOx),4 which is much lower than that
of a Z-scheme system, e.g., the SrTiO3:La, Rh/Au/BiVO4:Mo photocatalyst sheet, which exhibits an apparent quantum
efficiency of 33% at 419 nm.5 A Z-scheme
system can yield much higher efficiency than a single photocatalyst
for several reasons. Redox mediators in Z-schemes can enhance charge
separation and mitigate the issue of back reactions often occurred
in single photocatalyst systems. The photocatalysts in Z-scheme systems
usually required narrower band gaps than a single photocatalyst because
the band edges are dedicated to one half-reaction.6 Thus, only certain oxides and (oxy)nitrides can be used
as single photocatalysts for overall water splitting, while many narrow-bandgap
semiconductors can be potentially used in Z-scheme systems.7 Furthermore, photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
splitting also demonstrates a high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency,
such as ∼3.3% for overall water splitting at neutral pH over
double-band GaN:Mg/InGaN:Mg nanosheet photochemical diodes.8 Moreover, for safety reasons, a strategy for
in-situ separation of H2 and O2 is preferable,6 which can be achieved in either PEC or Z-scheme
systems, but is rather difficult in a single-photocatalyst suspension
system. The prerequisite for both PEC and Z-scheme systems is an efficient
photocatalyst for a half-reaction, either proton reduction or water
oxidation. Therefore, many studies concentrate on the discovery of
efficient photocatalysts for each half-reaction, as combining these
may be a more facile route to overall water splitting (e.g., by Z-scheme)
than discovering one single photocatalyst.

Inorganic photocatalysts,
such as metal oxides9−13 and metal (oxy)nitrides,14,15 have been widely explored
for the hydrogen evolution reaction. However,
the majorities only respond to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation14 or present moderate activity due to fast charge
recombination.15−18 Very recently, conjugated polymers have drawn considerable attentions
due to their appropriate conduction band positions and readily tunable
electronic structures. Photocatalytic hydrogen generation has been
widely investigated over these conjugated polymers such as graphitic
carbon nitride (g-C3N4),18−23 poly(triazine imide),24 and other relevant
triazine-based networks.25−27 Such polymer photocatalysts possess
delocalized π-bonds, which provide established pathways for
charge-carrier transport and present high efficiencies for hydrogen
evolution. However, the activities for photocatalytic water oxidation
over such reported polymers were limited by the valence band positions.
Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) were predicted to show a
greater driving force for water oxidation than g-C3N4.16,26 Moreover, the photocatalytic activities
of CTFs can be enhanced by modifying chemical and physical properties
through the selection of different monomers and the adjustments in
the synthesis processes.28,29 Typically, CTFs can
be synthesized by ionothermal trimerization of carbonitrile groups,
such as 1,4-dicyanobenzene (DCB),30 1,3,5-tris(4-cyanophenyl)benzene
(TCPB),31 and 2,6-dicyanopyridine (DCP),32 where a molten zinc salt was used as a solvent
and catalyst at temperatures over 400 °C. Recently, a microwave-assisted
approach was applied to prepare crystalline CTFs, P1M-P6M, in trifluorosulfonic
acid at 110 °C.33 Our previous work
already illustrated that a microwave-prepared CTF-1 photocatalyst
for two half-reactions of water splitting.34 However, the efficiency is still quite moderate. To change the ratio
of nitrogen to carbon in such a polymer will tune its electronic structure
as the valence band edge of triazine-containing polymers is dominated
by the nitrogen 2p orbitals, which shift the band positions that largely
affect the photocatalytic activity.34

Among all reported CTFs, CTF-0 possesses the highest nitrogen to
carbon ratio and only contains alternating benzene and triazine units.
It can therefore provide more active sites (triazine units) for oxidation
reactions.35 However, the photocatalytic
activity for either half-reaction over CTF-0 has not been experimentally
investigated, although first-principles calculations have predicted
that a monolayer CTF-0 contained suitable band positions for both
of the two half-reactions.35 Furthermore,
different stacking between layers would result in the interlayer coupling
of either C–C (AA stacking) or C–N (AB stacking), which
could affect the band edge alignments to the benefit of either half-reaction.35 Herein, we utilized different synthesis strategies
to optimize the triazine to benzene ratio and the interlayer stacking
to systematically study the relationship between photocatalyst structure
and photocatalytic activity for both hydrogen and oxygen evolutions
on CTF-0. CTF-0-M2 synthesized by a microwave-assisted
method at low temperature presents more AB-stacking orientation and
the highest nitrogen to carbon ratio, resulting in the highest photocatalytic
activity for hydrogen evolution among all studied. In parallel, CTF-0-I
prepared by the ionothermal trimerization method possesses more AA-stacking
tendency and the lowest nitrogen to carbon ratio, thus presenting
the best water oxidation performance. We further confirmed this important
correlation between photocatalytic activity, band alignment, and charge
dynamics by diverse spectroscopies and theoretical modeling.

2 Results and Discussion
CTF-0 photocatalysts were synthesized
by a microwave-assisted approach
(CTF-0-M1, CTF-0-M2, and CTF-0-M3) and an ionothermal method (CTF-0-I) as indicated in Scheme S1. The structures of the as-synthesized
photocatalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD)
spectroscopy as shown in Figure 1a. All of the samples have some degree of the extended
order.26,36 The degree of crystallinity can be optimized
by adjusting the ratio of catalyst (trifluoromethanesulfonic acid)
and monomer (1,3,5-tricyanobenzene) during microwave-assisted synthesis.
CTF-0-M2 with a precursor to acid catalyst ratio close
to 1:3 presents the highest degree of crystallinity, which is further
proved by the TEM image as shown in Figure S1. Either decreasing or increasing the monomer to acid ratio results
in a lower degree of crystallization. Two distinct peaks are located
at ∼15° and ∼25.5° in the PXRD patterns of
all samples. The low-angle peak at ∼15° can be attributed
to the in-plane reflection (100) of the hexagonal unit cell, while
the broad peak at ∼25.5° can be interpreted as the interlayer
spacing (001) with vertically stacked sheets of 3.4 Å.30,31 The relative intensities of (100) and (001) in the samples synthesized
via the two different methods are reverse. CTF-0-M2 shows
a relatively high intensity of (001), whereas the CTF-0-I is the (100), Figure 1a. Compared with
our calculated PXRD based on the AB- and AA-stacking models (Figure S2), denoted in the brown and pink lines
in Figure 1a, such
PXRD patterns suggest that CTF-0-M2 and CTF-0-I possess
AB and AA stacking, respectively, which is in line with previous theoretical
calculations.35,37 The AB-stacking possesses a lower
formation energy than the AA stacking by 0.03 eV per unit cell. Hence,
it is suggested that the CTF-0 tends to form AA stacking at high temperature
and over a long period of time as in the ionothermal method and AB
stacking in the low temperature and fast microwave approaches, namely,
microwave irradiation targets a lower energy stacking structure with
a C–N interlayer coupling, while the ionothermal method facilitates
the reorganization of monomers with C–C interlayer coupling.

by the ionothermal method and CTF-0-M1, CTF-0-M2, and CTF-0-M3 prepared by the microwave method.

The porosity of the CTFs was studied
by isothermal adsorption experiments
at 87 K by probing with argon as shown in Figure 1b. All samples (CTF-0-M1, -2, and -3) synthesized
by the microwave method show a very low argon-accessible surface area
of 2, 5, and 0.5 m2·g–1, respectively.
The CTF-0-I shows a comparably loose organic network with an apparent
BET surface of 201 m2·g–1, which
is likely owing to some decarboxylation processes and the production
of a small amount of gas during the synthesis at high temperature,
consistent with previous reports when polymerization is at higher
temperatures.31 As the carbonization is
hard to avoid in the current high-temperature ionothermal approach,
the generated surface area is high while it plays a minor role in
the activity enhancement.

As shown in Figure 1c, the 13C solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance (ssNMR)
provides information on the chemical structure of CTF-0 materials.
Three distinct peaks can be assigned to the unreacted cyano groups
and the neighboring carbon in the benzene rings (117 ppm), carbon
atoms in benzene rings (138 ppm), as well as carbon atoms in triazine
units (169 ppm).28,34 The peak at 117 ppm of CTF-1-M3 shifts to a low field, resulting in a shoulder peak located
at ca. 165 ppm which can be assigned to the C, N alternating heterocyclic
units due to incomplete trimerization. This can be caused by the low
concentration of monomers in the acidic solvent during microwave-assisted
synthesis, which is consistent with the PXRD result of the lowest
degree of crystallinity in CTF-0-M3. Moreover, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) further confirms the successful trimerization
in all samples, as shown in Figure 1d. Two peaks located at 1308 and 1519 cm–1 correspond to the triazine units, and a very small peak at 2244
cm–1 points to the terminal nitrile groups, incompletely
formed —N=C=N— groups, or other uncertain
multibonded C, N groups.31,38 CTF-0-I presents the
lowest signal intensity in the FTIR (2244 cm–1)
for nitrile groups likely due to some hydrolysis and further decarboxylation
when removing the Zn-containing impurities, which is consistent with
the higher surface area of CTF-0-I than the other samples as shown
in Figure 1b.

The elemental composition of all of the samples was analyzed by
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental analysis (EA)
as shown in Figures S3–S7 and Table S1, respectively. Both XPS and EA confirm
that all samples are composed only of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen.
The C 1s XPS measurements of the four samples reveal two peaks as
shown in Figure S4. The first signal at
284.8 eV is attributed to the carbon atoms of the aromatic rings as
well as adventitious carbon (C–C) which was used for calibrating
the XPS machine.28 The second one appears
at around 288.2 eV, assigned to the sp2-bonded carbon in
the triazine rings. The high-resolution N1s XPS spectra of these samples
are shown in Figure S5; the peaks located
at around 399 eV are associated with the N atoms in the triazine rings
in all samples. It also shows some difference of the peak shape among
different samples, which is consistent with the results of 13C ssNMR and FTIR, indicating a different degree of crystallinity.
We also confirm that there is no detectable zinc residue in CTF-0-I
by XPS (Figures S6 and S7). As XPS is a
surface-sensitive technique, EA measurements were used to quantify
the elemental compositions (Table S1).
The C:H:N ratio of CTF-0-M2 is 71.4:2.0:26.3, which is
among all of the samples the closest to the theoretical value of 70.6:2.0:27.4.

To further investigate the optical properties and derive their
band positions, photoluminescence spectra (PL), UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy, and valence-band XPS spectra were recorded
as shown in Figure 2. The emission peaks in the PL spectra are blue shifted following
the trend of CTF-0-I > CTF-0-M3 > CTF-0-M1>
CTF-0-M2. Notably, the carbon to nitrogen ratio shares
the same trend according to the elemental analysis (Table S1), which indicates that the higher the nitrogen to
carbon ratio, the smaller the band gap.39 The charge kinetics was verified by time-resolved photoluminescence
(Figures S8–S10). As shown in Figure S10a, the fitting results show no significant
difference between the three time constants for all four samples,
indicating the radiative recombination pathways fundamentally unchanged
among samples. The calculated average electron lifetime as shown in Table S2 indicates the better charge separation
on samples synthesized by microwave than those fabricated by the ionothermal
method with the CTF-0-M2 being the second best.40,41

(c) valence-band XPS spectra, and (d) experimentally estimated band
structure diagrams of CTF-0-I, CTF-0-M1, CTF-0-M2, and CTF-0-M3.

The UV–vis absorbance spectrum is shown in Figure 2b. It reveals that
the absorption
edges for CTF-0-I, CTF-0-M2, CTF-0-M1, and CTF-0-M3 are located at around 450, 600, 550, and 500 nm, respectively,
which is consistent with the trend of the maximum peak position of
the PL as shown in Figure 2a. In addition, the materials CTF-0-Ms prepared by the microwave
method show an enhancement in visible-light absorption compared to
the CTF-0-I. According to the positions of the absorption edges shown
in Figure 2b, the band
gaps of each material were calculated to be 2.76, 2.07, 2.25, and
2.48 eV for CTF-0-I, CTF-0-M2, CTF-0-M1, and
CTF-0-M3, respectively. To estimate the relative band positions
and valence band maximum (VBM), XPS spectra were collected. Figure 2c presents the different
offsets in the binding energies of the valence electrons. CTF-0-M2 presents the most negative valence band edge, and CTF-0-I
shows the largest valence band offset. The difference between the
two materials is ca. 0.8 eV. The valence band offsets of CTF-0-M1 and CTF-0-M3 are 0.5 and 0.1 eV more negative
than CTF-0-I. In a typical XPS measurement, the binding energy of
an electron represents the energy that the electron requires to occupy
the Fermi level of the XPS analyzer. The work function of the XPS
analyzer is ca. 4 (vs vacuum) and −0.4 eV (vs RHE at pH =
0).42 Thus, the valence band positions
of CTF-0-I, CTF-0-M2, CTF-0-M1, and CTF-0-M3 versus RHE at pH = 0 can be estimated of ca. +1.78, +0.97,
+1.20, and +1.70 eV (vs RHE at pH = 0), respectively. Given the band
gap obtained from UV–vis spectra as shown in Figure 2b and the XPS valence electron
spectra, the conduction band positions were calculated as −0.98,
−1.10, −1.05, and −0.78 eV (vs RHE at pH = 0),
respectively, for CTF-0-I, CTF-0-M2, CTF-0-M1, and CTF-0-M3. Therefore, the band positions of all polymer
photocatalysts are shown in Figure 2d. It should be noted that CTF-0-M2 and
CTF-0-M1 possess the highest conduction band potentials
and thus provide greater driving force for the hydrogen evolution
reaction, while the valence band edges of CTF-0-I and CTF-0-M3 are the lowest, benefiting the water oxidation reaction.
The change of the band positions can be attributed to the interlayer
coupling of valence electrons due to the different stacking (e.g.,
AA stacking for CTF-0-I and AB stacking for CTF-0-M2),33 the triazine to benzene ratio, and the type
of terminal groups (e.g., nitrile terminals in CTF-0-M2 and heterocycle terminals in CTF-0-M3).43

The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen and oxygen
evolution were
then tested as shown in Figure 3. The hydrogen evolution reaction was conducted in the presence
of 3 wt % Pt as the cocatalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as the sacrificial
electron donor. It is noted that the H2 evolution rate
measured here on CTF-0-M2 is the highest among all of the
polymers, up to 7010 μmol h–1 g–1 as shown in Figure 3a, which is six times higher than the activity of CTF-0-M3 of 1160 μmol h–1 g–1.
CTF-0-M2 is also very active under visible-light irradiation,
reaching 1030 μmol h–1 g–1 as shown in Figure 3c, which is around seven times more than CTF-0-M3 at 150
μmol h–1 g–1. The turnover
number of CTF-0-M2 in terms of reacted electrons relative
to the amount of Pt reaches 726 after a 6-h running experiment. Furthermore,
the oxygen evolution reaction over these materials without any cocatalyst
was carried out in the presence of Ag+ as the electron
scavenger. CTF-0-I shows the highest activity for O2 evolution
under both full arc and visible-light irradiation (226 and 59 μmol
g–1 in the first hour, respectively) as shown in Figure 3b and 3d.

Time course of H2 evolution and O2 evolution
under full arc (a and b) and under visible-light irradiation (λ
> 420 nm) (c and d); 0.1 g of photocatalyst was used for these
tests.

The photocatalytic activity for
water reduction and oxidation correlates
well to the band positions as shown in Figure 4a and 4b. The deeper
the valence band edge, the higher the water oxidation rate, and similarly
the more negative the conduction band edge, the higher the water reduction
rate. The relatively large surface area of 201 m2 g–1 for CTF-0-I versus 5 m2 g–1 for CTF-0-Ms also favors the photocatalytic efficiency by providing
a greater number of active sites, while there is no oxygen generated
on CTF-0-M2 under the same reaction conditions due to the
more negative valence band edge than required for the water oxidation
reaction.

by all photocatalysts under visible irradiation. (c) Apparent quantum
yield (AQY) for H2 production. (d) Stability test of CTF-0-M2 for H2 evolution under ambient conditions with
visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm).

To further prove that the reaction is driven by light absorption,
the apparent quantum yield (AQY) for H2 generation over
3 wt % Pt/CTF-0-M2 was examined with band-pass filters
at different wavelengths. The AQY is 11% at 365 nm and 8% at 420 nm.
Notably, H2 can also be produced even at 600 nm and results
in an AQY of 0.6% as shown in Figure 4c. Figure 4d presents the hydrogen evolution rate during seven day-long
runs. There is no noticeable deactivation in H2 evolution
over CTF-0-M2 as shown in Figure 4d, and around 4900 μmol of H2 was produced in total during these seven cycles, leading to a high
turnover number (TON) of 726 over platinum cocatalysts. The XRD patterns
and FTIR spectra of CTF-0-M2 after 50 h are similar to
those of the fresh sample as shown in Figure S11, indicating that the chemical structure is stable during photocatalytic
reactions. On the other hand, the AQY for O2 evolution
over CTF-0-I is observed to be 15% (365 nm) and 5.2% (420 nm) as shown
in Figure S12a. Figure S12b illustrates that CTF-0-I is able to produce O2 continuously over 39 h and obtains 305.9 μmol in total without
any cocatalyst. It should also be noted that N2 evolution
could not be detected during the reaction as shown in Figure S12b, indicating all of the oxygen generated
is from the photocatalytic water splitting, not from air leaks. The
rate of O2 evolution decreases during the reaction because
of the deposition of metallic silver on the surface of CTF-0-I, shielding
the incident light and turning the sample black. There is no noticeable
difference in the XRD and FTIR spectra of the sample before and after
oxygen evolution reactions as shown in Figure S13, except for a diffraction at ca. 38° after the reaction
in the XRD pattern (Figure S13a) attributed
to metallic Ag. The XPS spectra of CTF-0-I before and after the reaction
(Figure S14) are also consistent with the
observation of Ag deposition generated by the Ag+ reduction,
which is a typical behavior in the photocatalytic water oxidation
reaction when Ag+ is used as the electron scavenger.40−42 These results indicate the excellent stability of both CTF-0-M2 and CTF-0-I for photocatalytic proton reduction and water
oxidation, respectively. It is interesting to see that the covalent
triazine-based framework CTF-0-M2 produced by microwave
shows higher rates of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under both
UV and visible-light irradiation than the previously reported CTF-1,
leading to an AQY of 2% even at 500 nm, 3 times higher than CTF-1
under identical experimental conditions.34 In parallel, CTF-0-I exhibits the best photocatalytic water oxidation
performance without any cocatalysts, resulting in 5.2% AQY at 420
nm, again 5 times higher than CTF-1 under the same experimental conditions.34

To further understand the electronic properties
at the atomic level,
the monolayer CTF-0 was investigated by DFT calculations. Detailed
settings are illustrated in the Experimental Section. As shown in the Figure 5a, the charge in the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the
monolayer CTF-0 contains a major contribution from the triazine units
and the carbon bonded to hydrogen in the benzene units. The notable
electrons only from pz orbitals preferentially
determine the CBM. The valence band maximum (VBM), as shown in Figure 5c, is only located
over the triazine donors and contains contributions from electrons
in the px and py orbitals of the nitrogen atoms. The energy level diagram of
the monolayer CTF-0 is shown in Figure 5b. The simulated CBM and VBM of CTF-0 lie at −3.65
and −6.22 eV (vs vacuum), respectively. Compared with the redox
potential of water reduction (−4.44 eV vs vacuum) and oxidation
(−5.67 eV vs vacuum), the CBM and VBM provide sufficient driving
force for both hydrogen and oxygen generation, respectively. According
to Table S1, the nitrogen to carbon ratios
are 0.36, 0.35, 0.34, and 0.26 for CTF-0-M2, CTF-0-M1, CTF-0-M3, and CTF-0-I, respectively. Hence, we
speculate that the proposed VBM in Figure 2d shifts down with the decrease in triazine
units, leading to the positions of VBM following the order of CTF-0-M2 < CTF-0-M1< CTF-0-M3 < CTF-0-I
and CTF-0-I has the largest band gap based on the smaller change of
the CBM. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure S2, different stacking will also tune the position of the CBM. Our
calculations based on trilayer AA- and AB-stacking orientations show
that compared with AB stacking, the AA stacking lowers the CBM by
0.15 eV, which is consistent with the experimental results of CTF-0-I
(AA stacking) that presents a lower band gap edge position than CTF-0-M2 (AB stacking). However, the calculated VBM is not impacted
by the stacking. Thus, the main contribution of the VBM shift is likely
due to the nitrogen to carbon ratio. At the same time, the decrease
of nitrogen content results in significant widening of the band gap,
and thus, the material to some extent retains the capability to reduce
water into H2.

Figure 5 Spatial distribution of the conduction band
minimum (CBM) (a) and
valence band maximum (VBM) (c). Isosurface was set to 0.01 e/r03, where r0 is the Bohr radii. Solid lines represent the
primary cell of the CTF-0. Band alignments (b) of CTF-0 estimated
by DFT calculations. All energies were calculated with reference
to the vacuum level. Brown, purple, and pale pink spheres represent
carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms, respectively. Periodic on/off
photocurrent response (d) and Nyquist plots (e) of CTF-0-I, CTF-0-M1, CTF-0-M2, and CTF-0-M3 electrodes
are in 0.1 M Na2SO4 with 0 V bias versus Ag/AgCl.

One can see that although the
ratio of triazine rings to benzene
rings well interprets the VBM shift, the terminal nitrile group to
benzene rings is quite high (Table S3 and Figure 1c) and the nitrile
contribution could not be ignored. Further calculations with −CN
residue were carried out based on a 2 × 2 supercell with extracting
one 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene group to represent the material with unreacted
−CN group, as shown in Figure S15. The unsaturated carbon atoms were saturated by H. Three different
nitrogens in the framework were denoted as nitrile, triazine, and
link nitrogen. The projected density of states (pDOS) were plotted
in Figure S16a. For the nitrile-containing
CTF-0, the pz orbitals of the N in the
nitrile group and the link contribute to the VBM and CBM, respectively.
The change is also reflected in the band alignments, plotted in Figure S16b. Compared with monolayer pristine
CTF-0, the nitrile-containing frameworks have a lower band offset
of the CBM. Considering the real system consists of both pristine
CTF-0 and CTF-0 with a nitrile group, the nitrile groups will further
narrow the band gap, resulting into a band gap with the order CTF-0-M2 < CTF-0-M1< CTF-0-M3.

To
uncover the kinetics of photocatalysis in the CTF-0s, photocurrent
responses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were conducted
over CTF-0-I-, CTF-0-M1-, CTF-0-M2-, and CTF-0-M3-coated electrodes in a three-electrode photoelectrochemical
system. Figure 5d shows
the photocurrent curve generated by the electrodes for several on–off
cycles of irradiation. The photocurrent goes down to zero rapidly
once the light turns off, while the photocurrent will return to a
steady value when the light turns on again. The CTF-0-M2-coated photoelectrode shows the highest photocurrent over the other
photoelectrodes, indicating the highest efficiency for suppressing
charge recombination likely owing to the improvement of interlayer
charge transfer indicated by the PL spectra in Figure 2a. The current density follows the order
CTF-0-M2 > CTF-0-M1 > CTF-0-I > CTF-0-M3, which is in good agreement with the photocatalytic performance
for hydrogen generation. The charge transfer resistance was investigated
by EIS. Figure 5e reveals
that the Nyquist plot arc radius of CTF-0-M2 is much smaller
than other samples, suggesting lower electric charge transfer resistance
and faster interlayer photoinduced electron transfer. This trend is
consistent with the photocurrent results. Above all, the CTF-0-M2 showed the highest photocatalytic activity for proton reduction
among all samples, probably because of the narrowest band gap and
most negative CBM as well as the most efficient transport of photoinduced
electrons in the ordered-interlayer structure. These interesting results
from two complementary polymers point to a potential Z-scheme for
effective water splitting, which is currently underway.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we present here polymeric covalent
triazine-based frameworks
as tunable nonmetal photocatalysts synthesized by microwave and ionothermal
methods. The triazine units can be controlled by the precursor concentration
and the preparation method. A higher amount of nitrogen or triazine
units results in a more negative valence band edge, or the higher
the amount of benzene units, the more positive the valence band position,
as confirmed by XPS and modeling, indicating the triazine unit dominates
the valence band positions. The covalent triazine-based framework
CTF-0-M2 produced by the microwave method with the most
ordered interlayer structure and the highest amount of triazine units
shows the best photocatalytic hydrogen evolution under both UV and
visible-light irradiation, resulting in ca. 8% AQY at 420 nm and 2%
at 500 nm. The superior performance is ascribed to the narrowest band
gap, efficient interlayer charge transfer, and a more negative conduction
band edge than others. CTF-0-I with the highest benzene to triazine
ratio exhibits the best photocatalytic water oxidation performance
under both full arc and visible-light irradiation, leading to 5.2%
AQY at 420 nm, which is due to the deepest valence band edge and the
relatively large surface area. Thus, both efficient half-reaction
photocatalysts have been obtained. These triazine moieties can in
principle be readily tuned to further study their applications in
overall water splitting using a Z-scheme pathway and to explore the
mechanism of water oxidation and reduction to enhance their light
harvesting capability. The development of CTFs as tunable frameworks
for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution promotes the design
of tailor-made photosensitizers and photocatalysts with tunable optical
and electronical properties, which can also open a new avenue to diversify
the ongoing development of CTFs for optoelectronic applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
All
chemicals were used
as received: 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene (OTAVA Ltd.); trifluoromethanesulfonic
acid >99% (TFMS) (Sigma-Aldrich); zinc chloride 99.99% (Alfa Aesar).

4.2 Synthesis of CTF-0-I
CTF-0-I was
synthesized from 1 g (6.5 mmol) of 1, 3, 5-tricyanobenzene and using
0.9 g (6.5 mmol) of ZnCl2 as a catalyst in a glass ampule.
The ampule was dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 12 h. The ampule
was then flame sealed and transferred into a furnace for heat treatment
at 400 °C for 40 h. Breaking the cool ampule yielded a light-yellow
solid which was then ground thoroughly. The powder was dispersed in
water and kept stirring for 12 h at 90 °C after sonication. HCl
(0.1 M) was added, and the solution was stirred for another 12 h at
90 °C. The sample was finally washed successively with water,
acetone, and ethanol and then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C
for 12 h.

4.3 Synthesis of CTF-0-Ms
CTF-0-M1, CTF-0-M2, and CTF-0-M3 were synthesized
with 1 g of 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene (6.5 mmol) and 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mL
(17, 23, and 28 mmol) of TFMS as a catalyst and solvent. First, 1
g of 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene powder was moved into a 10 mL glass reaction
vessel (CEM, Discover and Explorer SP Vessels)34 with a magnetic stirrer. Under the ambient atmosphere,
the vessel was covered by a pressure control cap. The reaction was
conducted under a dynamic mode with a controlled temperature of 110
°C, and the reaction time was 30 min. The maximum power of the
microwave was set at 300 W and the safety pressure was set at 300
psi. In the first minute, the solution started boiling and pale-yellow
solid precipitates were formed gradually. After 30 min of microwave
heating the precipitates were collected and washed by ammonia solution
to remove the acid and then washed with ethanol, acetone, and water.
Finally, the products were obtained as powders after drying in a vacuum
oven at 180 °C for 12 h.

4.4 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns (PXRD) of the as-prepared samples were taken by a Bruker
D4 diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα irradiation (λ1 = 1.540562 Å, λ2 = 1.544398 Å).
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area measurement
was performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQC with Ar as a carrier
gas at 87K. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectra
were carried out on a Bruker Advance 300WB spectrometer running with
a 4 mm magic-angle spinning probe for 13C and 1H measurements. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) were performed
on a PerkinElmer 1605 FT-IR spectrometer in the wavelength range from
400 to 4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 0.5 cm–1. UV–vis reflectance spectroscopy was conducted
using a Shimazu UV–vis 2550 spectrophotometer fitted with barium
sulfate as a reference. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy measurements
were performed on a Renishaw spectrograph system based on use of Kayser
notch filters with a sensitive CCD detector coupled to a microscope
for point-by-point analyses using a 325 nm excitation laser and a
wavenumber range of 100–2000 cm–1. X-ray
photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed using a Thermoscientific
XPS K-alpha surface analysis machine using an Al source. Analysis
was performed using CasaXPS. Time-resolved PL spectra were obtained
on a TCSPC (LifeSpec-ps) from Edinburgh Instruments with an excitation
wavelength of 405 nm at −15 °C and fitted with a multi-exponential
function with three decay components using Origin.

4.5 Theoretical Calculations
To understand
the electron properties of the investigated compounds CTF-0, theoretical
calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed,
which was implanted in the Vienna ab initio Package (VASP).44 A plane wave cutoff of 520 eV was selected,
with the projector augmented wave methods used to treat the core electrons.45 The PBE functional was used for structure optimization
and electronic structure analysis.46 van
der Waals interactions were included via usage of the DFT-D2 method
of Grimme.47 All atoms were fully relaxed
until the change in force upon ionic displacement was less than 0.01
eV/Å, with the change in energies no greater than 10–5 eV. The bulk CTF-0 was generated using the AA- and AB-stacking motif.
The electronic properties were studied based on monolayer CTF-0. A
Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh of 11 × 11
× 1 was found to be sufficient in order to produce well-converged
energies and forces. Spin polarization was used in all calculations.
As a large vacuum spacing (15 Å) was used in our simulations,
the planar averaged electrostatic potential converged to a constant
value far from the surface. These converged values may be taken as
the reference level with which the Kohn–Sham (KS) eigenvalues
are aligned.48 For the band alignment of
the CTF-0, the Fermi level was determined by the calculations of each
work function, where the vacuum is set to zero. For the study of the
defected CTF-0 with nitrile terminals, a 2 × 2 supercell with
one with distracting one 1,3,5-tricyanobenzene group to represent
the material with an unsaturated −CN group in experiments (Figure S15). A K-point sampling
was set to 5 × 5 × 1 for the supercell calculations.

4.6 Photocatalytic Measurements
Oxygen
and hydrogen evolution performance was carried out separately in a
custom Pyrex batch reactor cell under the irradiation of a 300 W Xe
lamp (TrusTech PLS-SXE 300/300UV). A reaction cell under full-arc
irradiation was used for hydrogen evolution, containing 100 mg of
solid catalysts loaded with 3 wt % Pt and 230 mL of H2O
mixed with 10 vol % triethanolamine. For the oxygen evolution reaction,
the reactor contained 100 mg of solid catalysts and 1 g of AgNO3 dissolved in 230 mL of H2O. Before the reaction,
the reactor was sealed and then purged with argon to remove air. To
measure the photocatalytic efficiency under visible-light irradiation,
a 420 nm long pass filter was installed in front of the lamp to remove
UV light. Bandpass light filters, 365, 420, 500, 600, and 800 nm,
were used for quantum efficiency measurements. All of the product
gas was analyzed by gas chromatography (Varian 430-GC, TCD, argon
carrier gas 99.999%). The apparent quantum efficiency (Φ) was
calculated by the equation  where N, O, and n are the number of charge
carriers for one
mole of gas, moles of gas evolved, and number of the incident photons,
respectively. The number of incident photons was calculated by the
equation n = I/(hc/λ) = Iλ/hc, where the light intensity I was measured by a Newport power meter. Detailed parameters for calculating
the AQY data are shown in Table S4. The
turnover number (TON) was calculated after seven cycles by using the
following formula: TON = moles of H2 molecules generated/mole
of active sites (herein platinum amount on the surface of the photocatalyst).

4.7 Photoelectrochemical Measurements
The photoelectrochemical
properties were investigated in a conventional
three-electrode cell using an electrochemical analyzer (IVIUM Technologies).49 CTF-0 films were prepared as follows: FTO glass
was washed sequentially with distilled water, ethanol, and acetone
in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min. Then 5 mg CTF-0 powder was mixed
with 750 μL of distilled water, 250 μL of 2-propanol,
and 10 μL of Nafion in an ultrasonic cleaner for 30 min, and
then the slurry was coated onto 2 cm × 2 cm FTO by drop casting.
After drying overnight on a hot plate at 250 °C, the electrodes
were sintered at 400 °C for 30 min to improve adhesion. The prepared
films, a Pt mesh, and Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) were used as the working,
counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. Sunlight was simulated
with a 150 W xenon lamp (Newport) and AM 1.5 filter (Newport). The
light intensity was tuned using a calibrated crystalline silicon solar
cell, equivalent to global AM 1.5 illumination at 100 mW/cm2. The photocurrent of the samples was measured in 0.1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution (pH = 6.5). Samples were illuminated
from the back side (FTO substrate side), and the masked-off irradiated
area was 0.5 cm2. Mott–Schottky curves were measured
at a certain dc potential range with an ac amplitude of 5 mV and 
frequencies of 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz under dark conditions. Electrochemical
impedance spectra (EIS) were measured with 0.0 V bias versus AgCl/Ag.
