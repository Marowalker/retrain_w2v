The
active site in ethene oligomerization catalyzed by Ni-zeolites
is proposed to be a mobile Ni(II) complex, based on density functional
theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations corroborated
by continuous-flow experiments on Ni-SSZ-24 zeolite. The results of
the simulations at operating conditions show that ethene molecules
reversibly mobilize the active site as they exchange with the zeolite
as ligands on Ni during reaction. Microkinetic modeling was conducted
on the basis of free-energy profiles derived with DFT-MD for oligomerization
on these mobile [(ethene)2-Ni-alkyl]+ species.
The model reproduces the experimentally observed high selectivity
to dimerization and indicates that the mechanism is consistent with
the observed second-order rate dependence on ethene pressure.

Homogeneous
and heterogeneous
catalysts are traditionally distinguished by the active site being
either in solution or anchored on a support. However, recent works
have revealed heterogeneous catalysts where the active sites are mobilized:
selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia in Cu-SSZ-13
zeolite1 and with hydrocarbons in Ag-ZSM-5
zeolite,2 reactant-mobilized protons in
methanol to hydrocarbons conversion in H-ZSM-5,3 and ethylene dimerization/hydrogenation on Rh sites in
Y zeolite.4 In this work, we present findings
on a reaction, ethene oligomerization in Ni-SSZ-24 zeolite, that indicate
that the active site is reversibly mobilized and anchored to the support during the catalytic cycle.

There is increasing interest
in selective oligomerization of alkenes,
and in particular heterogeneous catalysts for ethene dimerization,
as it is both a fundamentally challenging topic of catalysis and a
versatile reaction for the chemical industry, such as forming butene
from biobased ethylene.5 Ni-aluminosilicates
have long been known as promising heterogeneous catalysts.6 Intriguingly, they work without the alkylaluminoxane
cocatalysts required for homogeneous and metal–organic framework
(MOF)-based heterogeneous catalysts.7 Nevertheless,
there is accumulating evidence provided by us and others that the
reaction follows the Cossee–Arlman mechanism (Scheme 1)8−11 known from homogeneous catalysis.
The three-dimensional structure of the Ni-aluminosilicates plays a
central role in alkene oligomerization: experimental results show
that dimer formation is first order in alkene pressure on Ni-silicaalumina10,12 but second order in Ni-zeolites.12,13 1-Butene formation
is also second order in mesoporous Ni-silicaalumina at low temperatures,
where it was demonstrated that condensation of ethene in the pores
stabilized catalytic activity.14 These
observations suggest that surrounding molecules can have a significant
influence on alkene oligomerization in Ni-aluminosilicates, an influence
we for the first time elucidate with molecular simulations mimicking
operating conditions.

Scheme 1 Cossee–Arlman Catalytic Cycle of
Ethene Oligomerization in
Ni(II) Cationic Complexes
We simulated ethene oligomerization in Ni-SSZ-24 using
density-functional-theory-based
molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations and advanced free-energy sampling
techniques. Such an approach has proven to account for the complexity
of catalytic reactions at operating conditions by allowing for dynamic
active sites and the influence of surrounding molecules.3,15 The latter was found to be critical to investigate the nature of
the active site in the presence of multiple ethene molecules. The
computational results show a remarkable resemblance between the active
sites in Ni-zeolites and homogeneous catalysts for alkene oligomerization,
as ethene molecules reversibly mobilize the Ni site inside the zeolite
pores. Continuous-flow experiments were conducted to verify the corresponding
kinetic parameters predicted from theory. This leads us to predict
that the active site within the Ni-zeolite dynamically crosses the
border between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis throughout
the reaction.

The computational part of this work takes its
starting point in
the Cossee–Arlman cycle, shown in Scheme 1, inferring that the Ni-ethyl species initially
forms in situ by reaction between Ni(II) ions and ethene (Section S1).11 We
seek to unravel the dynamics of the active site at operating conditions
by simulating the catalytic cycle in Ni-SSZ-24 zeolite with DFT-MD
(see details in Computational and Experimental Methods), starting from the simplest Cossee–Arlman species [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ surrounded by 2 ethene molecules in the micropore of the
simulation cell (Section S2.2). This ethene
loading corresponds to equilibrium at typical experimental conditions
of 120 °C and 25 bar ethene pressure,10,12 as evidenced by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations (Section S3). We have investigated several reaction
steps and obtain good agreement in the free-energy barriers of the
few of these steps that were investigated in our previous work (Section S2.4).8 We
collected the free-energy profiles of the elementary steps that make
up the most favorable pathways for ethene oligomerization in the diagram
shown in Figure 1.
Note that alkene adsorption/desorption in this diagram occurs from/to
the zeolite pore encompassing the adsorbates. By using the equilibrium
loading of two ethene molecules surrounding the [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ species, we ensure that in this state the free energy of
ethene in the pore is equivalent to that of gas phase ethene at 120
°C and 25 bar.

Figure 1 Free-energy diagram for ethene oligomerization pathways
in Ni-SSZ-24
zeolite at 25 bar and 120 °C, based on free-energy profiles of
elementary steps obtained with DFT-MD umbrella sampling simulations.
The reference state is the equilibrium loading of ethene surrounding
[ethene-Ni-ethyl]+, as discussed in the text. The numbers
indicate intrinsic free energies of activation in kJ/mol. As indicated
in the diagram, the [ethyl-Ni-butene]+ species can also
be reached by ethene desorption; see Section S2.3 for a detailed discussion of how the diagram was constructed.

Remarkably, the catalytic cycle
of oligomerization proceeds on
mobile complexes. Such a species is created from [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ by coordination of an additional ethene to Ni, thereby detaching
the Ni complex from the ion-exchange position of the zeolite to create
a mobile active site. The mobility is observed in the distribution
of Ni–Al distances in Figure 2: the distribution is shifted toward larger values
and is wider for the detached [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+ than the anchored species. In the mobile species Ni can achieve
its preferred square-planar coordination, realizing the maximal potential
of the metal site by opening up a favorable pathway for C–C
coupling (vide infra). Figure 2 shows the simulated free-energy profiles for coordination
of ethenes on Ni-alkyl species originally anchored to the zeolite.
The results show that [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ is stabilized
by coordination of up to two additional ethene molecules. In [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+, one oxygen coordination is replaced
by ethene and the second by an agostic bond with a β hydrogen
of the ethyl group, creating a square planar coordination of Ni (Figure 2, right inset). The
same is the case for the butyl analogue (Figure S8). This square-planar geometry is preferred for Ni as a d8 metal when coordinated to strong-field ligands,16 such as alkyl and hydride.17

Figure 2 Free-energy profiles for ethene coordination to [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ (left) and [ethene-Ni-butyl]+ (right) at 25 bar
and 120 °C, derived from DFT-MD simulations. The left inset shows
histograms of Ni–Al distances, illustrating that the doubly
and triply ethene-coordinated Ni-ethyl species are detached from the
framework and more mobile than their anchored counterpart. The associated
charge-separation energy is estimated to 78 kJ/mol (Section S2.5). The right insets show snapshots from the simulations
of the Ni-ethyl species, including the trajectories of the Ni (light
blue) and the α alkyl C (dark blue) atoms (Figure S8 shows the butyl analogues).

The mobile Ni complexes resemble a homogeneous oligomerization
catalyst in solution; the noncovalent interactions with the zeolite
framework parallel the nondirectional stabilization by a solvent shell.
However, the positively charged complex is tethered to the zeolite
framework by the negative charge of the ion-exchange site. Note that
there is a potential energy gain on formation of the [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+ detached species (28 kJ/mol, Section S2.6.1). Ethene coordination thus counteracts
the energy required to separate the positive Ni ion from the framework
(78 kJ/mol, Figure 2). As complex formation is also favored in free energy (19 kJ/mol, Figure 2), the entropy loss
of coordinating ethene is partly compensated by the configurational
entropy of the mobile [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+ complex;
translation (Figure S9) and rotation (inset
of Figure 2). This
rotation may also explain why ethene coordination to [ethene-Ni-butyl]+ is favored in potential energy (38 kJ/mol, Section S2.6.1) but slightly disfavored in free energy (3
kJ/mol, Figure 2);
the Ni-butyl species is bulkier than the ethyl analogue, limiting
rotation in the zeolite micropore (Figure S8).

C–C coupling is the central reaction step in ethene
oligomerization,
which in the mobile species proceeds through migratory insertion of
ethene in the Ni-alkyl bond. We find the intrinsic free-energy barrier
in [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+ to be significantly
lower than in both the anchored [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ species
and the mobile [(ethene)3-Ni-ethyl]+ species
(Table 1). We explain
this trend using Hammond’s postulate18 considering the structures shown in Figure 3; C–C coupling in [ethene-Ni-ethyl]+ is an endergonic reaction (Figure S11) leading to a large activation barrier with a late transition state
that resembles a [Ni-butyl]+ product with a γ-agostic
hydrogen bond. In [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+, the
reaction is exergonic (Figure S13), leading
to a low activation barrier with an early transition state that resembles
the reactant with the favorable square-planar coordination of Ni.
In [(ethene)3-Ni-ethyl]+ the transition state
(trigonal bipyramid) resembles neither the reactant (half trigonal
bipyramid) nor the product ([(ethene)2-Ni-butyl]+, square planar) and is hence significantly higher in free energy
than either state (Figure S14). The Ni-butyl
analogues exhibit the same trend (Figures S11 and S13).

and transition states (TS) of C–C coupling in [(ethene)x-Ni-ethyl]+ species in SSZ-24
zeolite. Planes of square and trigonal coordination are shown in blue
and yellow, respectively.

Following C–C coupling, the reaction proceeds from
[(ethene)2-Ni-butyl]+ via transfer of a β
hydrogen
of the butyl chain to form 1-butene, which subsequently desorbs. Like
for C–C coupling, the hydrogen transfer has the lowest barrier
in the mobile [(ethene)2-Ni-butyl]+ species
(20 kJ/mol, Figures 1 and S21), as hydrogen is already involved
in an agostic bond to Ni prior to reaction (see Ni-ethyl analogue
in Figure 3). In contrast,
the anchored [ethene-Ni-butyl]+ species undergoes a significant
rearrangement to reach the transition state, reflected in a higher
barrier (38 kJ/mol, Figures 1 and S18).

The last step
toward dimerization is desorption of 1-butene. Analogously
to ethene (Table 1),
the 1-butene desorption barrier decreases with ethene coordination
and is hence lowest in [(ethene)2-ethyl-Ni-1-butene]+ (Table S5). This can be explained
by the late transition state of desorption: in this species, the 1-butene
weakly interacts with the favored square-planar [(ethene)2-Ni-ethyl]+ (Figure S22). In
the latter species, the catalytic cycle is closed.

In summary,
we have used DFT-MD to predict that both ethene dimerization
and trimerization are catalyzed by positively charged Ni complexes
mobilized by ethene coordination. The transition states involved in
butene formation are slightly lower in free energy than that for hexene
formation (Figure 1), indicating a preference toward butene over higher oligomers. Indeed,
when employing the free-energy profiles in a microkinetic model (Section S4), we obtain a rate of formation of
1-butene that is 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of 1-hexene
(Section S4.3).

We now consider experimental
results to verify our computational
findings. Ethene oligomerization was investigated in continuous-flow
experiments on Ni-SSZ-24 zeolite (see details in Computational and Experimental Methods). The catalyst achieves
a selectivity of more than 98% to butenes at ethene pressures ranging
from 4 to 26 bar (Section S5.3), in agreement
with the computational result that the production rate of butene is
2 orders of magnitude higher than that of hexene as a representative
of higher oligomers. Figure 4 shows that the rate of butene (and hexene) formation is second
order in ethene pressure and that the apparent activation energy is
virtually pressure-independent. These findings strongly suggest that
the oligomerization mechanism is the same over a wide pressure range.
The observed reaction order agrees with microkinetic modeling based
on the free-energy profiles shown in Figure 1, where oligomerization occurs on mobile
active sites. Note that a second order is only obtained from the model
when [ethyl-Ni-alkene]+ species are the most abundant adsorbates,
the catalyst resting states (Table S7, Section S4.3). We note that the predicted coverage of [ethyl-Ni-alkene]+ and hence the reaction order is sensitive to the free energy
of these species (Table S7), which is associated
with some uncertainty (Section S2.3). However,
a zeolite-anchored [ethyl-Ni-alkene]+ resting state is
consistent with recent experimental X-ray absorption data, which indicate
that in the catalyst resting state in Ni-Beta zeolite, Ni is in tetrahedral
coordination with oxygens in the first coordination shell.11 In the context of resting states it is instructive
to consider the concept of the energetic span introduced
by Kozuch and Shaik: the largest free-energy difference between an
adsorbate and a transition state along the catalytic cycle, corresponding
to the apparent free energy of activation.19 While being cautious about using the free energies from Figure 1 directly (Section S2.3), we derive an energetic span for
butene formation of 71 kJ/mol between the [ethyl-Ni-butene]+ and the transition state of hydrogen transfer, which is in fairly
good agreement with the 58 kJ/mol derived from the experiments (Section S5.3.1).

in Ni-SSZ-24: (a) Arrhenius plot for butene formation at 4 and 26
bar ethene pressure, (b) reaction order of butene and hexene formation
at 150 °C, and (c) butene isomer selectivity at 150 °C.
All results were obtained at differential ethene conversions of 1–7%.

Finally, the experimental results
indicate that both 1- and 2-butenes
are primary products (Section S5.3), as
was also observed on Ni-Beta.11 This supports
the Cossee–Arlman mechanism, as the [ethyl-Ni-butene]+ species can isomerize between 1- and 2-butene through β-hydrogen
elimination on the Ni site prior to desorption (Figure S17), analogously to homogeneous catalysts.20 Note also that 1-butene selectivity increases
with pressure (Figure 4), contrary to what would be expected for isomerization at Brønsted
acid sites, but paralleling the results of previous work by Agirrezabal-Telleria
and Iglesia on mesoporous Ni-silicaalumina.14 Interestingly, the same work demonstrated stabilization of catalytic
activity at subambient temperatures when ethene condenses in the mesopores.14 Such conditions likely favor coordination of
multiple ethene molecules to form the mobile sites described here
(Section S6). These sites may be involved
in the stabilization, as they facilitate butene desorption over further
oligomerization.

In conclusion, we have conducted an experimental
and computational
investigation of ethene oligomerization in Ni-SSZ-24 zeolite. The
computational results allow us to make detailed predictions about
the reaction at operating conditions; two ethene molecules adsorb
on Ni-alkyl species, creating mobile active sites in the zeolite pores.
The mobilization is reversible, as ethene dynamically exchanges with
oxygens of the zeolite support as ligand on Ni during the reaction. Microkinetic modeling based on calculated free-energy
profiles reproduces the experimentally observed relative production
rate of butene over higher oligomers of 102. The model
indicates that the proposed mechanism leads to a second-order rate
dependence on ethene pressure as experimentally observed here and
elsewhere.12,14 An analogous mechanism may explain
the second-order rate dependence observed in 1-butene dimerization.13 Such reactant-mobilized active sites have also
been observed in selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides
with ammonia in Cu-SSZ-13 zeolite1 and
with hydrocarbons in Ag-ZSM-5,2 in methanol
to hydrocarbons conversion in H-ZSM-5,3 and ethylene dimerization/hydrogenation on Rh sites in Y zeolite.4 Together these works present materials that appear
as hybrids between heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, highlighting
an intriguing regime of catalysis21 that
likely extends beyond the examples known to date.

Computational
and Experimental Methods
Density functional theory (DFT)-based
Molecular Dynamics (DFT-MD)
simulations were carried out with CP2K,22 versions 2.6 and 3.0.23 Energies and
forces were calculated from DFT based on a mixed Gaussian and plane
wave approach24 using the revPBE functional25 with Grimme D3 dispersion correction.26 DFT-MD calculations were carried out nonspinpolarized,
as our previous work determined the singlet state to be the most stable
for the Ni(II) species investigated here.8 The majority of the simulations employed a super cell constructed
by repeating the AFI unit cell twice along the channel direction (1
× 1 × 2) and making one Si/Al substitution (Si/Al = 47),
while a larger super cell (Si/Al = 72) was used in a few simulations
(Figure S23). Enhanced free-energy sampling
in the DFT-MD simulations was done using umbrella sampling27,28 with quadratic potentials by interfacing CP2K with PLUMED 2.29 Free-energy profiles of elementary reaction
steps were computed from the output of umbrella simulations along
collective variables, using the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method
(WHAM).27 Monte Carlo simulations were
carried out using LAMMPS,30 while microkinetic
modeling was conducted with CatMAP.31 Graphics
of molecular structures from the DFT-MD simulations were created using
POV-Ray 3.6 and VMD 1.9.1.32

The
synthesis of SSZ-24 was conducted as described in literature.33 The zeolite was ion-exchanged five consecutive
times with 0.1 M Ni(NO3)2(aq), washed and calcined
to form Ni-SSZ-24, Si/Al = 80, Ni/Al = 0.34. Kinetic experiments were
carried out in a continuous-flow, fixed-bed, stainless steel reactor.
Standard measurement conditions were 150 °C and 30 bar total
pressure, P(ethene)=26 bar, P(inert)=4 bar, with a total flow rate
of 30 mL/min (contact time at STP: 6.7 mgcat·min·mLethene–1).
A small fraction of the effluent was analyzed on an online gas chromatograph.
