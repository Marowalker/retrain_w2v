The selectivity toward lower olefins
during the methanol-to-olefins
conversion over H-SAPO-34 at reaction temperatures between 573 and
773 K has been studied with a combination of operando UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and online gas chromatography. It
was found that the selectivity toward propylene increases in the temperature
range of 573–623 K, while it decreases in the temperature range
of 623–773 K. The high degree of incorporation of olefins,
mainly propylene, into the hydrocarbon pool affects the product selectivity
at lower reaction temperatures. The nature and dynamics of the active
and deactivating hydrocarbon species with increasing reaction temperature
were revealed by a non-negative matrix factorization of the time-resolved
operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra. The active hydrocarbon
pool species consist of mainly highly methylated benzene carbocations
at temperatures between 573 and 598 K, of both highly methylated benzene
carbocations and methylated naphthalene carbocations at 623 K, and
of only methylated naphthalene carbocations at temperatures between
673 and 773 K. The operando spectroscopy results suggest that the
nature of the active species also influences the olefin selectivity.
In fact, monoenylic and highly methylated benzene carbocations are
more selective to the formation of propylene, whereas the formation
of the group of low methylated benzene carbocations and methylated
naphthalene carbocations at higher reaction temperatures (i.e., 673
and 773 K) favors the formation of ethylene. At reaction temperatures
between 573 and 623 K, catalyst deactivation is caused by the gradual
filling of the micropores with methylated naphthalene carbocations,
while between 623 and 773 K the formation of neutral poly aromatics
and phenanthrene/anthracene carbocations are mainly responsible for
catalyst deactivation, their respective contribution increasing with
increasing reaction temperature. Methanol pulse experiments at different
temperatures demonstrate the dynamics between methylated benzene and
methylated naphthalene carbocations. It was found that methylated
naphthalene carbocations species are deactivating and block the micropores
at low reaction temperatures, while acting as the active species at
higher reaction temperatures, although they give rise to the formation
of extended hydrocarbon deposits.

1 Introduction
The conversion of methanol into olefins (MTO) can be performed
using different types of heterogeneous acid-based catalyst materials,
such as microporous aluminosilicates and silicoaluminophosphates.1−6 The MTO process and related catalyst materials have been intensively
studied since the 1970s. The synthesis of light olefins, such as ethylene
and propylene, has attracted a lot of attention as they are the key
intermediates for the production of many useful chemicals and polymers.
Ethylene is used for the preparation of polyethylene, ethylene oxide,
styrene, ethylene glycol, and polyvinyl chloride, while propylene
is an important base chemical for the production of propylene oxide,
phenol, and polypropylene, for example.

The MTO reaction is
a highly complex process. Understanding and
elucidating the reaction mechanism is challenging and has implications
for both fundamental research and commercial application. Among the
proposed mechanism for the MTO reaction, the most generally accepted
is the one proposed by Dahl and Kolboe.7 It involves the formation of a hydrocarbon pool (HCP), but it only
explains the autocatalytic part of the MTO reaction.

According
to few recent studies, the MTO reaction is initiated
by hydrocarbon species, like acetate/formate, methyl acetate, and
dimethoxymethane, which were formed during the very early stages of
reaction.8−11 All these species eventually participate in the formation of HCP
species during the course of reaction. On the other hand, large and
systematic efforts have already been devoted to elucidate the HCP
mechanism of MTO reaction using a wide variety of theoretical9,12−14 and experimental approaches.8−11,15−31 From the experimental point of view, next to kinetic and isotopic
labeling experiments,15−18 several spectroscopic techniques, such as solid-state NMR,9,11,19−23 UV–vis, fluorescence (micro)spectroscopy,24−28 and FT-IR (micro)spectroscopy29−31 have been used. On the basis
of these findings, methylated benzene carbocations32 and cyclopentenyl carbocations33 are generally accepted as the active hydrocarbon pool species during
the zeolite-catalyzed MTO process, including both H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34
molecular sieves. For example, Haw et al. correlated the product selectivity
during the MTO process with the nature of the hydrocarbon pool species
formed in SAPO-34 zeolite pores using a combination of GC analysis
with pulse-quench in situ NMR.34 They observed
that methylated benzenes with five or six methyl groups per ring are
the most active for olefins formation with a higher selectivity toward
propylene than toward ethylene. In contrast, methylated benzenes with
fewer methyl groups (i.e., ∼3 −CH3) were
less active, but showed a higher selectivity toward ethylene.

Furthermore, there are other factors, such as catalyst acidity
and coke content, which affect the product selectivity. Formation
of coke inside the zeolite material also causes changes in the material
properties. It might for example influence the density and strength
of acid sites and cavity size, which lead to different product selectivity
and nature of intermediate species. For example, Chen et al. studied
the relation between coke formation and selectivity.35 They observed that selectivity changes with the amount
of coke less than 10 wt % were independent of the zeolite crystal
size. In particular, the selectivity toward ethylene increases with
increasing coke content. Furthermore, it was found that the propylene/ethylene
molar ratio decreased with increasing coke content, but was independent
of the crystal size up to 12 wt % of coke.36 Wang et al. observed that the selectivity toward ethylene and propylene
over SAPO-34 does not depend only on the catalyst structure, but it
is also influenced by the reaction conditions.12 They proposed a reaction network, where cracking reactions
play a key role in the product selectivity. From their calculations,
ethylene is produced via cracking of C5+ and
C6+ ions with higher barriers, while propylene
is produced via cracking of higher enyl carbocations.

In addition,
Lercher and co-workers performed the methanol-to-olefins
reaction accompanied by cofeeding aromatic or olefins in order to
understand the product selectivity.37 For
this purpose, various aromatic molecules (i.e., benzene, toluene,
and xylene) or olefins (i.e., ethylene, propylene, 1-butylene, 1-pentene,
and 1-hexene) were used as cofeeding components during the methanol-to-olefins
reaction over H-ZSM-5. The addition of aromatic molecules (16–32
C%), which enhanced the aromatics-based catalytic cycle and greatly
suppressed the olefin-based cycle, leads to an enhanced formation
of methane and ethylene accompanied by the methylation of aromatic
rings at the expense of propylene and C4+ higher
olefins. The ratio of propylene to ethylene is controlled by the concentration
of the added aromatic molecules.37 Wu et
al. studied the effect of adding ethylene, propylene, and water to
methanol feed during the MTO reaction over H-SAPO-34.38 They observed that when propylene is fed with methanol
and water, the selectivity toward propylene decreases, but the selectivity
toward ethylene and C4= olefins increases. Interestingly,
when ethylene is fed to a reactor, the selectivity toward ethylene
decreases, but the selectivity toward propylene and butenes increases.
These results indicate that ethylene and propylene react with methanol
to form propylene and C4= olefins, respectively.
The presence of propylene in the feed inhibits the reaction of ethylene
with methanol through competition for the adsorption on a stronger
acidic site.38 Corma and co-workers have
studied the H-SAPO-34 and found that silicon distribution strongly
affects the lifetime and product selectivity.39 They observed that a higher C2/C3 ratio is
related to a higher population of Si atoms at the border of the Si
islands, which are considered to be the acid sites of higher strength.

From the above discussions, it becomes evident that various parameters
affect the selectivity toward ethylene and propylene during the MTO
process. More specifically, the factors include the nature of the
reaction intermediate species formed,34 the size of the cavity and the related type of zeolite structure,40,41 the formation of coke within cavity,35 the crystal size of zeolite materials,39 the acid site density,35,39 and the reaction conditions,
such as space velocity42 and reaction temperature.43 On the other hand, there are a limited number
of papers, which provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for
the propylene-to-ethylene selectivity change within a specific parameter,
including for example the reaction temperature.

In this work,
the MTO conversion process has been studied in detail
over H-SAPO-34 at different reaction temperatures (i.e., between 573
and 773 K). By using a combination of operando time-resolved UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and online gas chromatography, it
becomes possible to determine the reasons for the variation of product
composition with increasing reaction temperatures. This work is complementary
to a recent study from our group focusing on the influence of the
reaction temperature on the nature of the active and deactivating
species during the MTO process over zeolite H-SSZ-13.28 As a result, a detailed comparison can be made between
the reaction and deactivation behavior of H-SAPO-34 and H-SSZ-13 for
different reaction temperatures. Furthermore, by using methanol pulse
experiments at different temperatures, we can determine the dynamics
of different hydrocarbon pool species, and their relative contributions
to the formation of ethylene and propylene, as well as catalyst deactivation.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Characteristics of H-SAPO-34
The
H-SAPO-34 catalyst under study was purchased from ACS Material (U.S.A.).
The catalyst sample was calcined in air under the following conditions:
1 K·min–1 to 393 K, held for 2.5 h; 2.2 K·min–1 to 623 K, and held for 3 h; and finally 0.8 K·min–1 to 853 K, and held for 3 h. After calcination, the
catalyst material was in its H-form. The crystal size and morphology
were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using a Tecnai
FEI XL 30SFEG instrument, while the overall crystallinity was measured
by a Bruker D2 X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with a Co Kα
X-ray tube (λ = 1.7902 Å). The X-ray diffraction (XRD)
pattern was recorded in the region of 5° - 50° 2θ
at room temperature. The sample acidity was measured with temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of ammonia using a Micrometrics AutoChem 2910 apparatus.
Prior to ammonia TPD, 100 mg of sample were placed in a quartz tube
reactor and preheated at 823 K in 25 mL·min–1 of He flow for 30 min. Adsorption of ammonia (5 vol % in He) was
performed for 45 min at 373 K. The physisorbed ammonia was flushed
under a He stream (50 mL·min–1) at 373 K for
2 h. After that, the ammonia TPD was carried out in a He flow at the
range of temperatures of 373 to 873 K using a heating rate of 10 K·min–1. The amount of adsorbed ammonia was measured by a
thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The pore volume and surface area
were determined by Ar physisorption measurements using a Micromeritics
ASAP 2420.

2.2 Operando UV–vis
Diffuse Reflectance
Spectroscopy
Catalytic testing was done in a fixed-bed quartz
reactor. The catalyst powder was pressed into a pellet and then was
crushed and sieved. The 212–425 μm fraction was used
for the catalytic tests. Prior to the reaction, ∼50 mg of the
catalyst were activated at 823 K under 100% oxygen for 1 h and then
cooled down to the desired reaction temperature. Weight-hourly space
velocity (WHSV) of methanol was kept at 0.5 g·g–1·h–1 by flowing He gas through a methanol
saturator, which was kept at 293 K. The catalytic reactions were performed
at a wide range of temperatures, 573–773 K, where the catalyst
was fully active for the MTO reaction. For the analysis of the reactant
and reaction products, online gas chromatography (GC) was performed
using an Interscience Compact GC instrument equipped with Rtx-1+Rtx-Wax,
Rt-TCEP+Rtx-1 and Al2O3/Na2SO4 columns, and a TCD and two flame ionization detectors (FIDs).
Olefins/water feeding experiments were carried out in the same setup
and conditions as the MTO catalytic testing. Instead of methanol,
a mixture of ethylene, propylene, and water was flowed through the
H-SAPO-34 catalyst at 573, 598, 623, 673, and 773 K. The olefins were
flowed using mass flow controllers, and water was introduced using
a saturator in a similar way as the methanol experiments. The WHSV
of ethylene, propylene, and water were 0.23, 0.23, and 0.14 g·g–1·h–1, respectively, which gives
a total WHSV of 0.6 g·g–1·h–1.

The nature and dynamics of the hydrocarbon pool active species
and related coke compounds formed during the MTO and olefin reactions
were investigated by operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.
A UV–vis light was focused into the whole reactor bed using
a custom-made Avantes high-temperature UV–vis probe. This probe
comprises one excitation and one collection optical fiber with 400
μm diameter and 1.5 m length. The optical fibers are placed
in a stainless steel protection sleeve, which is specially designed
to operate under reaction temperatures up to 873 K. The UV–vis
probe is connected to a deuterium-halogen light source and the UV–vis
light, ranging between 12 500 cm–1 and 45 000
cm–1, was collected by an AvaSpec 2048 UV–vis
spectrometer. Operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra were
collected every 30 s, with 100 accumulations of 140 ms exposure time
each. These settings ensure an appropriate signal-to-noise ratio with
an adequate time resolution to monitor the dynamics of the UV–vis
spectra. A detailed scheme of the operando UV–vis spectroscopy-online
GC set up, as well as other characteristics of the setup can be found
in a previous publication from our group.28

For the analysis of the time-resolved operando UV–vis
diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy data, non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF)
was applied. NNMF44,45 is a widely used factor analysis
method to factorize a (non-negative) data matrix T × W into two
matrices X (T × k) and Y (k × W) with the constraints that
all matrices have only positive elements. Detailed information about
the application of NNMF in the treatment of the operando UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra can be found in our previous publication
on the catalytic and spectroscopic properties of zeolite H-SSZ-13.28

2.3 Methanol-to-Olefins Quenching
Experiments
The same operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy
set up was used to perform experiments where the MTO reaction was
quenched. The catalyst preparation and reaction conditions were the
same as for a typical MTO experiment. The first experiment includes
the start of the methanol flow at 523 K, heating the H-SAPO-34 material
up to 543 K and holding it at this temperature while flowing methanol.
After that the methanol flow was stopped, and the catalyst was flushed
with He until no methanol and reaction products were detected by online
GC. The final stage involves heating the H-SAPO-34 material up to
573 K, holding it at this temperature and cooling down to room temperature.
The second experiment was performed in the same manner. The temperature
was 573 K when the methanol flow started. The catalyst was heated
up to 623 K and held at this temperature until no products and methanol
were detected. Subsequently, the reactor was cooled to room temperature.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Catalyst
Characterization
The XRD
pattern of the calcined H-SAPO-34 catalyst, shown in Figure S1a, indicates that the sample has the chabazite (CHA)
structure. More specifically, the XRD pattern includes the characteristic
reflections of this framework structure, that is, at 2θ 11.3,
15.3, 16.5, 19.0, 21.0, 22.6, 24.4, 27.3, 29.5, 30.7, 36.2, 36.8,
as reported by the International Zeolite Association.46 The peak at ∼10° 2θ does not correspond
to the presence of an additional phase in the sample and it arises
from the CHA reflection of the Co anode Kβ line. This line contributes
to the H-SAPO-34 X-ray pattern and is present because of the XRD diffractometer
used, which does not filter out all the Co Kβ lines. A detailed
explanation of this instrumental issue is provided in our earlier
publication.28 Crystal sizes of the material,
as determined by SEM, range between 1 and 8 μm, as shown in
the micrograph in Figure S1b. The ammonia
TPD profile of the sample is reported in Figure S1c. The H-SAPO-34 material contains weak and strong acid sites,
which correspond to the TPD peaks at low (420 K) and high temperatures
(600 K).47 The desorption band at 420 K
can be assigned to ammonia adsorbed either on physically48 or weak Lewis acid sites.49 The ammonia desorbed at higher temperatures (i.e., 620
K for the H-SAPO-34 under investigation) is related to the number
of strong Brønsted acid sites (BAS).50 These measurements revealed that the amount of desorbed ammonia
at high temperature is 0.5 mmol·g–1. Considering
that the amount of silicon in the samples is 1.9 mmol·g–1, 27% of the silicon atoms are creating Brønsted acid sites.
Ar adsorption and desorption isotherms are shown in Figure S2. The material has a BET surface area of 530 m2·g–1 and is fully microporous, with
a micropore volume of 0.15 cm3·g–1.

3.2 Catalytic Performance
We have recently
reported a relationship between the hydrocarbon species formed inside
a H-SSZ-13 zeolite catalyst and its activity and deactivation.28 Additionally, it was found that the reaction
temperature influences the rate and nature of the hydrocarbon species
inside the catalyst and its catalytic performance. Our first scientific
question is now if we can find a similar relationship for a H-SAPO-34
material, which is structurally analogous to zeolite H-SSZ-13 (CHA
framework). The catalytic performance of H-SAPO-34 was first evaluated
at different MTO reaction temperatures (i.e., 573, 598, 623, 679,
and 773 K) using a WHSV of 0.5 g·g–1·h–1. The conversion and selectivity as a function of
the methanol throughput are presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Conversion and selectivity profiles for the
methanol-to-olefin
reaction as a function of methanol throughput over H-SAPO-34 at a
WHSV of 0.5 g·g–1·h–1 at (a) 573 K; (b) 598 K; (c) 623 K; (d) 673 K; and (e) 773 K. The
green points correspond to the induction period, when conversion of
methanol is less than 100%; the red points indicate a period of full
conversion of methanol; the blue points relate to the deactivation
period, when the conversion of methanol drops from 100% to 20%; while
the black points correspond to the deactivated catalyst, when the
conversion of methanol is less than 20%.

By evaluating the catalytic conversion, for all the reaction
temperatures,
the H-SAPO-34 sample shows an induction period where no catalytic
activity is observed. This induction period could be attributed to
the existence of a direct mechanism, which is operational just prior
to the HCP mechanism, during the early stages of the MTO reaction.
Methanol is initially consumed in the formation of zeolite acetate/formate,
methyl acetate, and dimethoxymethane as a result of “methanol
decarbonylation/zeolite carbonylation” pathway during induction
period of MTO reaction.8−11 All these species formed during the induction period later initiate
and/or participate in the formation of HCP species during the course
of MTO reaction, as has recently been observed independently by Lercher
and co-workers10 and our research group.11 This induction period is particularly pronounced
for low reaction temperatures (i.e., 573 and 598 K). During this typical
period in the MTO reaction, the active hydrocarbon species for this
process are forming inside of the H-SAPO-34 nanocages.51

The catalyst lifetime increases with increasing
reaction temperature,
within the range of temperatures studied (i.e., 573–773 K).
Our results do not correlate with previous studies by Bleken et al.,51 where the optimum reaction temperature was 673
K. It is important to mention that we were also unable to correlate
our previous results on H-SSZ-1328 with
those reported by Bleken et al.51 Intrigued
by this divergence in results, we have checked the temperature in
the reactor with a second thermocouple and found that the temperature
could only deviate ∼25 K, which does not explain the observed
differences. In this way, one could think that other parameters, for
instance, particle size and acidity, can influence the optimum reaction
temperature. Wilson and Barger52 showed
that the smaller the particle size (less than 1 μm), the longer
lifetime of H-SAPO-34 in the MTO reaction. Since the H-SAPO-34 particles
used by Bleken et al.51 are smaller (from
0.2 to 2 μm) than ours, this could explain the observed discrepancy
in optimum working temperatures. In our case, the H-SAPO-34 particle
size is ∼1–8 μm (Figure S1c), and because of diffusion limitations, the entire crystal volume
is, most likely, not fully utilized at 673 K. This reasoning is in
line with our in situ microspectroscopy work on large (∼100
× 20 × 20 μm3) H-ZSM-5 crystals24−27 and (∼40 × 40 × 40 μm3) H-SAPO-34
crystals29,31 during methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion
processes as a function of reaction temperature, although zoning of
Al (and Si) may also account for the observed differences.

The
product selectivity is dominated by ethylene and propylene,
and in general, the sum of both components is higher that 70%. Propylene
selectivity is relatively independent of the reaction temperature
(25–30%), whereas ethylene selectivity strongly depends on
the reaction temperature, from around 40% at low reaction temperatures
up to more that 60% for the highest reaction temperature. The selectivity
to paraffins is also high, especially at the beginning of the reaction,
which can be due to the formation of aromatics inside of the SAPO-34
cages via hydride transfer reactions.53

3.3 Operando UV–vis Diffuse Reflectance
Spectroscopy
a Effect of the Hydrocarbon
Pool on Catalyst Activity
and Deactivation
During the catalytic reaction, the catalyst
was continuously monitored by operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy. These measurements provide direct insight into the nature
and dynamics of distinct hydrocarbon pool species at the different
reaction temperatures under study. Figure 2 shows the time-resolved operando UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra during the induction period of the reaction
(indicated in green), at full conversion (indicated in red), when
the conversion drops from 100% to 20% (indicated in blue) and finally
when the catalyst is completely deactivated (indicated in black).

Figure 2 Time-resolved
operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra
recorded for the methanol-to-olefin reaction over the H-SAPO-34 material
at a WHSV of 0.5 g·g–1·h–1 at (a) 573 K; (b) 598 K; (c) 623 K; (d) 673 K; and (e) 773 K. The
green spectra correspond to the induction period, when conversion
of methanol is less than 100%; the red spectra indicate a period of
full conversion of methanol; the blue spectra relate to the deactivation
period, when the conversion of methanol drops from 100% to 20%; while
the black spectra correspond to the deactivated catalyst, when the
conversion of methanol is less than 20%.

Clearly, the time-resolved operando UV–vis diffuse
reflectance
spectra are a complex amalgam of absorption bands with discrete kinetics,
and therefore, we have used a multivariate method, named NNMF, for
the statistical analysis of the spectroscopic data. More details about
these spectroscopic measurements and related analysis using NNMF can
be found in our previous work.28 The results
of the analysis are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Non-negative matrix factorization of the time-resolved
operando
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy data. The operando
UV–vis spectra during methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reaction over
H-SAPO-34 were deconvoluted into two groups of absorption bands (eigenspectra)
for the hydrocarbon species with different kinetics (a, c, e, g, i)
and the evolution of every group of hydrocarbon species as a function
of methanol loading on the catalyst material (b, d, f, h, j). The
spectra were recorded during the MTO reaction at 573 K (a and b),
598 K (c and d), 623 K (e and f), 673 K (g and h) and 773 K (i and
j). The red curve represents group I (active hydrocarbon species),
while the black curve corresponds to group II (deactivating hydrocarbon
species). The green dots in the figures correspond to the values for
catalytic conversion.

By applying NNMF, the time-resolved operando UV–vis
diffuse
reflectance spectra were dissected into two groups of spectra, depicted
in Figure 3a, c, e,
g, and i, with different kinetic behavior, as illustrated in Figure 3b, d, f, h, and j,
which can be interpreted based on the existing literature on band
assignments (Table 1).33,54−69 At low reaction temperatures (573–623 K), the first
group of hydrocarbon species comprises absorption bands at
∼34 000 and ∼26 000 cm–1, which arise from monoenyl45,59 and highly methylated
benzene carbocations28,55−58 (Table 1). In contrast, at higher reaction temperatures
the first group of hydrocarbon species is characterized
by absorption bands at ∼36 000 and ∼24 500
cm–1, which correspond respectively to neutral aromatics55,61 and methylated naphthalene carbocations (Table 1).28,57,58

To understand the role of this first group of hydrocarbon
species, the kinetics of these species were compared with
the catalytic performance. The analysis shows that the intensity of
the first group of hydrocarbon species increases until reaching a
maximum at full conversion and then, in general, decreases until it
is virtually disappeared when the catalyst deactivates, which suggest
that these species are associated with catalyst activity.

The second group of hydrocarbon species at low
reaction temperatures (573 and 598 K) includes absorption bands at
∼30 000 and ∼24 500 cm–1, which are assigned to low methylated benzene carbocations28 and methylated naphthalene carbocations,28,57,58 respectively. By inspecting the
kinetics of those species, their contribution increases with increasing
time-on-stream. This indicates that the role of this second
group of hydrocarbon species is closely related to the stage
of deactivation of the material. As a consequence, we propose that
the role of methylated naphthalene carbocations is blocking the pores
of the H-SAPO-34 material, whereas the low methylated benzene carbocations
arise as a consequence of demethylation of highly methylated carbocations
due to the lack of methanol inside of the H-SAPO-34 material.70 As mentioned before, and in line with the work
of Haw and co-workers,34 it is postulated
that low methylated benzene carbocations are less-active HCP species
than highly methylated benzene carbocations, while at the same time
more selective toward ethylene.

At higher reaction temperatures
(i.e., 623–773 K) the chemistry
of the second group of hydrocarbon species clearly
changes. More specifically, at 623 and 673 K, catalyst deactivation
goes along with a broadening of the absorption band at ∼24 500
cm–1, together with the formation of bands at ∼20 000
and ∼16 700 cm–1. This suggests that
at these temperatures, the methylated naphthalene carbocations are
not the deactivating species, but instead the neutral poly aromatics
and phenanthrene/anthracene carbocations deactivates the H-SAPO-34
catalyst material by hindering the diffusion of the reaction products
(Table 1). At 773 K,
a featureless spectrum is observed, which is due to the formation
of more conjugated aromatics, most probably deposited on the external
surface. The contribution of this second group of hydrocarbon
species increases linearly with increasing methanol loading
and deactivation of H-SAPO-34 occurs when it reaches a plateau, indicating
complete pore blockage by external coke.

On the basis of these
observations, we are able to conclude that
on H-SAPO-34 the activity and selectivity can be also linked to the
formation of hydrocarbon species on the catalyst. Additionally, the
chemistry of the hydrocarbon species is fairly sensitive to the reaction
temperature, in agreement with our previous results for H-SSZ-13 catalyst.28 The nature of the active species appears to
be very similar for both H-SAPO-34 and H-SSZ-13 (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). However, the highly
methylated benzene carbocations are the dominant active species at
higher reaction temperatures (573–623 K) compared to H-SSZ-13
(573–598 K). Looking at the deactivating species, for H-SSZ-13
the contribution of the external coke toward deactivation is higher
as compared to H-SAPO-34. The different behavior is, most probably,
due to the higher acidity of the H-SSZ-13 material, favoring the formation
of more conjugated bulky species (Figure S1c of the Supporting Information). The higher acidity of SSZ-13 is confirmed
by the higher desorption temperature of NH3 (i.e., 685
K)28 compared to 600 K for SAPO-34 as shown
in Figure S3 in the Supporting Information.

b Effect of the Hydrocarbon Pool on Catalyst Selectivity
Our operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and
NNMF analysis methodology allows the identification of the active
and deactivating species during the MTO reaction at different reaction
temperatures. The next step was to unravel the origin of the catalyst
selectivity during the reaction. Figure 4 plots the measured ethylene-to-propylene
ratio for the MTO reaction over H-SAPO-34 with increasing reaction
temperature and time-on-stream. Two main features are observed: one
at low reaction temperatures (573–623 K) where the ethylene-to-propylene
ratio is high at the first stages of the MTO reaction and then decreases
and somehow stabilizes. In the second at high reaction temperatures
(673–773 K), the ethylene-to-propylene ratio is always increasing
with time-on-stream.

Figure 4 Ethylene-to-propylene ratio calculated from the product
composition
for the methanol-to-olefin reaction as a function of the methanol
throughput over H-SAPO-34.

Interestingly, these changes in catalyst selectivity patterns
correlate
with the changes in the nature of the active species. In this way,
the group of monoenylic and highly methylated benzene carbocations
will be more selective to the formation of propylene, whereas the
formation of the group of low methylated benzene carbocations and
methylated naphthalene carbocations at higher reaction temperatures
(i.e., 673 and 773 K) favors the formation of ethylene. Our results
are in line with the studies conducted by Haw et al. on the selectivity
of H-SAPO-34.62 These authors prepared
a H-SAPO-34 catalyst containing methylated naphthalene carbocations
in the cages and this material yielded a higher amount of ethylene
than an analogous material loaded with methylbenzenes.

c Effect of the Olefins Reactivity on Catalyst
Selectivity
If catalyst deactivation was dictated solely
by the hydrocarbon pool species, we are unable to determine the origin
of the changes in selectivity with time-on-stream. In fact, the evolution
of the selectivity at low reaction temperature (573–623 K)
drastically changes at the beginning of the reaction, ranging from
a catalyst system very selective toward ethylene to one which is more
selective toward propylene. The secondary reaction of olefins might
account for these changes in the selectivity with increasing time-on-stream.
To evaluate this effect, we have performed a set of experiments, feeding
a mixture of ethylene, propylene, and water, mimicking the formation
of reaction products during the MTO reaction. During these experiments,
the hydrocarbons formed on the catalysts and changes in olefin composition
were analyzed by operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
and online GC, respectively.

Figure 5a,b show the incorporation of ethylene and
propylene into the catalyst as hydrocarbon pool species, respectively.
The composition of the gas stream after going through the catalyst
bed is also plotted in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. The results show that both olefins are incorporated
into the hydrocarbon pool but at different levels. The incorporation
of propylene into the hydrocarbon pool is, in general, ∼2–3
times higher than for ethylene. As an example, at 598 K the incorporation
of ethylene and propylene is around 20 and 60 mol % after 10 min on
stream, respectively. Based on these experiments we suggest that the
changes in catalyst selectivity with increasing time-on-stream are
closely related to the incorporation of olefins into the hydrocarbon
pool.

Figure 5 (a) Incorporation of C2= and (b) incorporation of C3= during the C2=/C3=/H2O
feeding experiments at different reaction temperatures vs time-on-stream
for a H-SAPO-34 catalyst.

In order to evaluate the effect of the hydrocarbon species
formed
by olefins, the MTO reaction were performed on the SAPO-34 catalyst
after olefin feeding. The operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectra recorded at the end of olefins/water feeding experiments and
during the MTO reaction are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra
recorded at
(a) at 598 K; (b) 623 K; (c) 673 K; and (d) 773 K. The green spectrum
corresponds to the end of the C2=/C3=/H2O feeding experiments; the red spectrum relates to the full
MeOH conversion; the blue spectrum indicates deactivation of H-SAPO-34,
while the black spectrum corresponds to catalyst deactivation.

During olefins/water feeding the
development of the absorption
bands in the operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra at
∼36 000, ∼26 000–23 000,
∼20 000, and ∼16 000 cm–1 is observed. These absorption bands can be interpreted on the basis
of Table 1, which summarizes
the spectral assignment of these and other absorption bands based
on the literature.28,33,54−69

On the basis of this analysis, the formation of the neutral
and
charged aromatics with a different degree of conjugation and methylation
degree is observed, i.e., neutral benzenes, low and highly methylated
benzene carbocations, methylated naphthalene carbocations, and phenanthrene/anthracene
carbocations. Therefore, olefins and mainly propylene contribute to
the formation not only of HCP, that is, methylated benzene and naphthalene
carbocations, but also of more conjugated aromatics, such as phenanthrene
and anthracene carbocations. Additionally, the development of background
absorption in the operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra
indicates the formation of external coke from the olefins. Further
evidence for this observation comes from our previous work involving
operando UV–vis and confocal fluorescence microspectroscopy
on large H-SAPO-34 and H-ZSM-5 crystals.24−27,29,31

The start of the methanol flow during
the MTO reaction does not
cause changes of the chemistry of the species already formed during
olefins feeding experiments because the position of the absorption
bands for the UV–vis spectra at full MeOH conversion (red color)
does not change. However, for low reaction temperatures (i.e., 598
and 623 K), the formation of a new UV–vis band at ∼33 650
cm–1 is observed. This band can be either assigned
to monoenyl carbocations54,63 or alkyl-substituted
cyclopentenyl carbocations (Table 1).33,40 Since we do not detect this absorption
band during the olefins feeding experiments, this band could be ascribed
to an active hydrocarbon pool species.

To understand the effect
of the formation of hydrocarbon deposits
on the catalyst lifetime, the methanol throughput during a normal
MTO measurement and after olefins reaction was compared and summarized
in Table 2. The stability
of H-SAPO-34 during the MTO reaction after the prefeeding the catalyst
with olefins and water is ∼2 times lower in comparison to the
normal MTO reaction (Table 2).

MTO Reactions Performed at Normal Conditions and after the Pre-Feeding
the Catalyst with Ethylene, Propylene, and Water

623 K	0.98	0.52

773 K	2.1	1.45	
This
indicates once more that together with the incorporation of
propylene and ethylene into the hydrocarbon pool species, they also
contribute to the formation of deactivating hydrocarbon deposits.
For every reaction temperature, the feeding time corresponds to the
time of the normal MTO reaction (Figure 1). With respect to the operando UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra after olefins feeding, the level of the
background intensity increases with increasing reaction temperature.
More specifically, the absorbance of the background increases from
0.15 to 0.60 for the reaction temperature of 598 and 773 K, respectively.
It points toward the fact that the higher the reaction temperature,
the higher the amount of coke is formed.

However, we cannot
rule out here the role of thermodynamics, which
can have an influence on the product selectivity of the MTO reaction.
This was already reported by Wilson and Barger.52 For a more precise understanding whether thermodynamics
can rule the observed product composition, we have applied the HSC
Chemistry Software (Outotec) for calculating the ethylene-to-propylene
ratio in the range of applied reaction temperatures. The result is
summarized in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. Indeed, in accordance with the thermodynamic equilibrium, ethylene
becomes dominant when the reaction temperature increases, which is
in line with the high reaction temperatures (i.e., 673–773
K).

3.4 Further Insights into the Methanol-to-Olefins
Mechanism
In order to obtain further insights into the methanol-to-olefins
mechanism, we have performed two additional experiments, in which
we have switched on and off the methanol flow and at the same time
varied the reaction temperature, while continuously measuring the
operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra as well as the
formation of reaction products. The first of these experiment was
conducted at lower reaction temperatures (i.e., between 523 and 573
K), and the results are summarized in Figure 7, which shows the amount of detected reaction
products, the recorded time-resolved operando UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra, and the reaction temperature sequence program
applied.

Figure 7 (a) Product composition and (b) selectivity and operando UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra over H-SAPO-34: at 523 K (in gray) and
543 K (in green) during methanol flow; at 543 K during a stop of the
methanol flow and flushing with He (in orange); after heating the
catalyst up to 573 K, and holding the material at 573 K (in pink),
during cooling to room temperature (in brown) and finally measured
at room temperature (in blue).

At a reaction temperature of 523 K, no UV–vis absorption
bands and no reaction products were detected. Indeed, this temperature
is too low to initiate the creation of the hydrocarbon pool in H-SAPO-34.
When the reaction temperature was increased up to 543 K, the formation
of the absorption band at ∼26 000 cm–1 was detected, which is associated with the formation of hydrocarbon
pool species, that is, highly methylated benzene carbocations (Table 1). At the same time,
the formation of the reaction products started (Figure 7a), and an absorption band at ∼29 000
cm–1 emerges, which is, most probably, related to
the formation of low methylated benzene carbocations (Figure 7b, Table 1). Demethylation and formation of the reaction
products still continued after the methanol flow was stopped. More
specifically, the absorption band for the low methylated benzene carbocations
became more distinct and even shifted to higher wavenumbers (i.e.,
∼ 30 000 cm–1), which is attributed
to the further demethylation of benzene carbocations. When the H-SAPO-34
catalyst was brought up to a reaction temperature of 573 K, the reaction
products started to form again. A shift of the absorption band from
∼26 000 to ∼25 000 cm–1 is observed, which can be indicative for the formation of methylated
naphthalene carbocations. This can be a result of the condensation
of low methylated benzene carbocations after switching off the methanol
flow.

In order to prove the envisaged deactivation mechanism—at
lower reaction temperatures (i.e., at 573 and 598 K), where methylated
naphtalene carbocations are found to be the deactivating species,
and follow the mechanism of the MTO reaction at higher reaction temperatures
(i.e., 623–773 K), where the same species are detected to be
the active—we have conducted a second additional experiment.
In this experiment, first methanol was flowed over the catalyst at
573 K, followed by a switching off of the methanol at the same temperature,
followed by a further heating of the catalyst up to a reaction temperature
of 623 K. During the switch off of methanol, both the product formation
and operando UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra have been continuously
monitored. The results of this additional experiment are summarized
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 (a) Product
composition and (b) selectivity and operando UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectra of H-SAPO-34 recorded: at 573 K (in green)
during methanol flow; at 573 K during stop of methanol flow and flushing
with He (in orange); at heating up and holding the catalyst up at
623 K (in pink) and during cooling to room temperature (in brown)
and finally at room temperature (in blue).

After the start of the methanol flow at 573 K, the UV–vis
bands typical for highly methylated benzene carbocations (∼26 000
cm–1) and monoenyl carbocations (∼33 650
cm–1) appear (Table 1), proving that these carbocations are the active species
at lower reaction temperatures (i.e., 573 K). The absorption band
for low methylated benzene carbocations (∼29 000 cm–1) is also observed as a consequence of demethylation
reactions. When the methanol flow was stopped (i.e., the orange colored
spectra in Figure 8), the formation of olefins slows, and the UV–vis band shifts
from ∼26 000 to ∼25 000 cm–1, indicating the presence of methylated naphthalene carbocations
(Table 1). These species
play the role of deactivating species at low reaction temperature.
In order to confirm that at higher reaction temperatures these hydrocarbon
species are indeed the active species, the H-SAPO-34 catalyst was
heated up to 623 K. Then, as it can be concluded from Figure 8a, the reaction products start
to form (again). This formation of propylene and ethylene is accompanied
by a slight shift of the absorption band at ∼25 000
cm–1 to lower wavenumbers, which is a sign of demethylation
of naphthalene carbocations (Table 1). On the other hand, the typical UV–vis absorption
bands for anthracene and phenanthrene carbocations are also detected
at 623 K, which is associated with the formation of hydrocarbon deposits.
The formation of hydrocarbon species that are deactivating and blocking
the catalyst micropores at lower reaction temperatures, while become
the active HCP species at higher reaction temperatures has also been
observed for other small-pore zeolites. More specifically, the role
of 1-methylnapthalene during MTO in framework structure DDR is deactivating
at 623 K, while becoming an active HCP species at 723 K.71 On the other hand, in line with the earlier
work of Hereijgers and co-workers,70 some
of the spectroscopically observed hydrocarbon species may not be accessible
for reaction with incoming species, thereby influencing both activity
and selectivity.

4 Conclusions
This
study was directed toward the understanding of the parameters
ruling olefin selectivity and catalyst deactivation during MTO conversion
over H-SAPO-34. We have found that several factors dictate the ethylene/propylene
selectivity. First of all, the ethylene-to-propylene ratio decreases
for the temperature window of 573–623 K and increases when
the reaction temperature was increased up to 773 K. Second, at lower
reaction temperatures (i.e., 573–623 K), the selectivity is
ruled by the high degree of incorporation of olefins, mainly propylene,
into the hydrocarbon pool. The nature and dynamics of active and deactivating
species with increasing reaction temperature were determined by a
detailed analysis of the time-resolved operando UV–vis diffuse
reflectance spectra with non-negative matrix factorization. It was
concluded that the active hydrocarbon pool species at 573 and 598
K are mainly highly methylated benzene carbocations and monoenyl carbocations,
while at 623 K low methylated benzene carbocations and methylated
naphthalene carbocations become the more dominant hydrocarbon pool
species. Furthermore, at reaction temperatures of 673 and 773 K, only
methylated naphthalene carbocations are observed, while also some
neutral aromatics are detected. The changes in hydrocarbon pool species
also influence the olefin selectivity. More specifically, the group
of monoenylic and highly methylated benzene carbocations are more
selective to the formation of propylene, whereas the formation of
the group of low methylated benzene carbocations and methylated naphthalene
carbocations at higher reaction temperatures (i.e., 673 and 773 K)
favors the formation of ethylene.

At 573 and 598 K, catalyst
deactivation occurs due to the pore
filling with these methylated naphthalene carbocations. At temperatures
between 623 and 773 K, catalyst deactivation occurs due to the formation
of neutral poly aromatics and phenanthrene/anthracene carbocations
on the external surface. These species contribute the most to the
catalyst behavior with increasing reaction temperature. The formation
of bulkier deactivating species with increasing temperature also seems
to have an impact on the higher ethylene-to-propylene ratio. When
comparing SAPO-34 with the zeolite analogous SSZ-13, the nature of
the active and deactivating species are very similar, although in
SAPO-34 the hydrocarbon species causing activity are more stable at
higher temperatures. The different behavior is, most probably, due
to the higher acidity of the H-SSZ-13 material, favoring the formation
of more conjugated and bulky hydrocarbon species.
