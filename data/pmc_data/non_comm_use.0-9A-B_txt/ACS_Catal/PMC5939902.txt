Heterogenization
of molecular catalysts for CO2 electroreduction
has attracted significant research activity, due to the combined advantages
of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. In this work, we demonstrate
the strong influence of the nature of the substrate on the selectivity
and reactivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, as well
as on the stability of the studied immobilized indium(III) protoporphyrin
IX, for electrosynthesis of formic acid. Additionally, we investigate
strategies to improve the CO2 reduction by tuning the chemical
functionality of the substrate surface by means of electrochemical
and plasma treatment and by catalyst encapsulation in polymer membranes.
We point out several underlying factors that affect the performance
of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The insights gained
here allow one to optimize heterogenized molecular systems for enhanced
CO2 electroreduction without modification of the catalyst
itself.

Introduction
The electrocatalytic
reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is a potentially efficacious
strategy to tackle global energy
concerns, particularly to close the carbon cycle and store renewable
electrical energy in chemicals or fuels.1 The latter is highly desired due to the intermittent character of
renewable energy production. The last few decades have experienced
the discovery and development of various electrocatalysts, which all
lead to a diversity of products with different selectivities and activities.2−4 In addition to heterogeneous CO2 electrocatalysis using
metal, metal alloy, or metal-derived nanostructured electrocatalysts,
molecular catalysis of CO2 has shown interesting properties
and has undergone a striking development over the years.5−8 Molecular catalysts are generally considered to yield high selectivity
and activity and can be designed in such a way as to mimic enzymes
used in nature to efficiently catalyze specific electrochemical reactions
such as hydrogen evolution, water oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction,
and oxygen reduction.6,9 Although their stability and solubility
in aqueous electrolytes and their poor robustness are often drawbacks,
molecular catalysts are widely used to decipher mechanistic insight
due to their well-known molecular structure and efficiency. Hence,
many studies have been performed on intrinsic catalyst properties
such as the influence of the metal center10−12 and ligands.13−17 The focus herein will be on metalloporphyrins, a subgroup of molecular
catalysts extensively used for CO2RR research.18,19 In previous work, we reported that cobalt(II) and indium(III) protoporphyrin
IX (InPP) immobilized on pyrolytic graphite exhibit high selectivity
toward carbon monoxide and formic acid, respectively.12,20

The usually poor solubility of molecular catalysts in aqueous
media
and need for large amounts of catalyst related to homogeneous molecular
catalysts can be overcome by heterogenization. The molecular catalyst
is immobilized on a conductive electrode, which we will refer to as
“the substrate” in the remainder of this article. An
additional advantage of immobilization of the catalyst is the more
facile product separation, if the catalyst is utilized in a large-scale
industrial process. Carbon materials are often employed as substrates
owing to their relatively low cost, robustness, and inert nature toward
many (electro)chemical reactions. Examples are pyrolytic graphite,
glassy carbon, and more recently boron-doped diamond, carbon nanotubes,
and graphene.21−23 Carbon materials exhibit a rich surface chemistry,
and their surface functionalization has been proved to play an important
role in their electrochemistry.24 Studies
by Morozan et al. and Rigsby et al. have demonstrated the important
influence of the carbon support of porphyrins on the selectivity of
the oxygen reduction reaction.22,25 Magdesieva et al. reported
on activated carbon supports with different pore sizes for CO2RR on various porphyrin and phthalocyanine complexes, leading
to different selectivities.26 However,
little systematic or comparative work has been performed hitherto,
to elucidate the intrinsic influence of the substrate or surface functionalization.
The choice of a specific substrate is often solely based on empirical
considerations, which is not necessarily the optimal system.

Modification of electrodes started in the early 1980s with several
methods such as chemisorption or covalent attachment of species on
the electrode surface, encapsulation of species in polymer films,
and electropolymerization of monomers directly on the electrode.27,28 More recently, Yaghi and co-workers developed a covalent organic
framework of porphyrin building blocks, which showed promising results
for the CO2RR.29 An overview
of various catalyst-modified electrodes for CO2RR has been
given by Sun et al.30 From heterogeneous
electrocatalysis of the CO2RR, it is known that the electrode
morphology and (sub)surface structure significantly influence the
activity and selectivity.31−33 Moreover, the use of polymers
has been shown to enhance CO2RR efficiency on cobalt phthalocyanines.34−36 In the field of heterogenized molecular catalysis of the CO2RR, the effects of such substrate modifications are still
unexplored. The importance of the chemical functionality on the adsorption
and reactivity, as extensively discussed by McCreery,24 is the inspiration of the idea that substrate modification
may affect the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the CO2RR. In a recent review, the importance of so-called secondary
phenomena in molecular electrocatalysis has been highlighted.37 It would be very attractive to be able to tailor
the surface chemistry in such a way as to enhance CO2RR
performance.

In this study we focus on extrinsic properties
of the molecular
catalyst, particularly related to the immobilization of the molecular
catalyst. This work is a step toward a systematic investigation of
the chemical functionality of carbon substrates and the chemical environment
for heterogenized molecular catalysts. Herein, we study InPP immobilized
on different carbon materials, basal-plane pyrolytic graphite (PG),
glassy carbon (GC), and boron-doped diamond (BDD), and evince the
important role of the substrate, its pretreatment, and the use of
polymer membranes for immobilization in the CO2RR performance.
The current work demonstrates the improvement of CO2RR
catalysis on heterogenized indium(III) protoporphyrin IX by modifying
the substrate, its chemical functionality, and chemical environment
of the catalyst. The findings can function as a first step in trying
to improve other heterogenized molecular systems as well.

Experimental
Section
The electrochemical experiments were carried out
with a potentiostat
(IviumStat or CompactStat, Ivium Technologies), in a conventional
three-electrode cell, where the working electrode (WE) and counter
electrode (CE) compartments were separated by a Nafion membrane (Nafion
115). Basal-plane pyrolytic graphite, glassy carbon, and boron-doped
diamond disks (5, 5, and 10 mm diameters, respectively) were used
as WEs. The counter electrode and reference electrode (RE) were a
platinum wire and a reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively. For
correct measurements versus the RHE scale, the Luggin capillary and
the RHE compartment were filled with CO2-saturated electrolyte
before CO2 reduction. The electrolyte is 0.1 M phosphate
buffer of pH 9.6 ± 0.1, prepared with K2HPO4, K3PO4, and ultrapure water (Millipore Milli-Q
gradient A10 system, 18.2 MΩ cm). The choice for this pH was
based on the enhanced HCOOH selectivity observed previously.12 The reported current densities were always normalized
by the geometric surface area of the WE, and in some cases additional
normalization by the amount of active species was performed for correct
comparison of the activity. The potentials were corrected for ohmic
drop by the potentiostat during measurement. Generally, potentiostatic
bulk electrolysis was performed at E = −1.5
V vs RHE for 90 min, with manual collection of 100 μL samples
at certain times, and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography.
The reported concentrations of liquid products, or subsequently calculated
Faradaic efficiencies (FEs), are an average of three to five independent
experiments with freshly prepared electrodes. Additionally, the data
points for each experiment were obtained by the average of three injections
of the same sample. The dominant contribution of the uncertainty in
concentration/FE resulted from the different experiments. Additional
experimental details can be found in the Supporting Information.

Results and Discussion
Substrate Effect
We compare the selectivity and activity
for CO2RR on InPP immobilized on PG, GC, and BDD substrates.
The immobilization procedure and amount of InPP dropcasted per cm2 were kept the same for all the substrates (details in the Supporting Information). From the Faradaic efficiency
toward HCOOH, given in Figure 1a, it is observed that the substrate has a significant influence
on the selectivity of the CO2RR on immobilized InPP. The
PG substrate is the most selective toward HCOOH and the GC substrate
the least selective. These effects cannot be ascribed to the activity
of the bare substrate, as shown by control experiments in Figure S17a, which show that bare PG, GC, and
BDD are not active for the CO2RR under our experimental
conditions. In Figure 1b–d, the absolute total and partial current densities are
shown for the CO2RR on the different substrates. For a
correct comparison of the activity, the current density was also normalized
by the indium content of the substrate (denoted by j*). As will be discussed in detail later, the electroactive coverages
of InPP are not the same for the different substrates. It can be seen
that there is a 1 order of magnitude difference in jtotal* and jHCOOH* on PG in comparison to GC and BDD. Note that this difference is
not associated with a difference in electrochemical active surface
area (ECSA), as shown in Figure S8a. The
fact that GC and BDD both perform worse in comparison to PG indicates
that the enhancement in CO2RR selectivity and activity
cannot be ascribed to the high content of either sp2 or
sp3 carbon atoms present in GC and BDD, respectively.

density, (c) absolute partial current density for HCOOH, and (d) absolute
partial current density for H2 during CO2 reduction
on immobilized InPP on different substrates in 0.1 M phosphate buffer
of pH 9.6. Lines are given to guide the eye.

The results in Figure 1 are in line with the online mass spectrometry and online
HPLC experiments, depicted in parts a and b of Figure 2, respectively, from which we confirm that
significantly more H2 is produced on InPP-GC and significantly
more HCOOH on InPP-PG. The CO2 consumption on InPP-PG is
also much higher in comparison to the other substrates, in agreement
with higher jtotal* and the higher HCOOH production rate observed
on PG in comparison to the other substrates. Although it is difficult
to quantify, the onset potential for H2 and HCOOH on InPP-BDD
is at a more negative potential in comparison to PG and GC, which
is a general characteristic of BDD. Moreover, in Figure 2b we can observe differences
in the peak potentials of HCOOH formation between the different substrates,
which is related to the competition of the hydrogen evolution reaction
(HER).

during CO2 reduction on immobilized InPP on different substrates

In addition to a change in selectivity and activity, there
is a
clear difference in stability between the substrates, since a slight
decrease is observed in jHCOOH* as a function of time on PG and GC,
accompanied by an increase in jH2*. We define the relative
FE with respect to the initial value (eq 1) as a measure for the stability of the system. From
a graph of this relative FE versus time (Figure 3a), we can compare experiments with different
values of FE. A more horizontal trend indicates a higher stability
as the FE does not decrease significantly in time. 1

min and t = 1 h) with the indium content (atom %)
given in the inset, (c) Faradaic efficiency toward HCOOH (left axis)
and partial current density for HCOOH (right axis) as a function of
the amount InPP drop-casted on the different substrates (lines given
to guide the eye), and (d) indium content of the InPP immobilized
on the substrates, as estimated from XPS, as a function of the amount
InPP drop-casted (lines given to guide the eye).

The tendency of the FE to decrease with time has been observed
before and was associated with the detachment of InPP from the surface
or deactivation of the porphyrin.12 We
have performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on InPP-PG before
and after electrolysis, as shown in Figure 3b. We observed that the indium content on
the electrode, which is a measure of the actual amount of InPP adsorbed
on PG, is substantially decreased after 10 min, with a negligible
further decrease after 1 h, which is in agreement with the decreasing
trend of FE as a function of time. For our work, the charge of redox
peaks related to InPP is not an accurate measure to obtain quantitative
information about the amount of InPP on the substrate, and we rely
on XPS for the quantification of the indium content on the substrate.
Additionally, we performed experiments under homogeneous conditions
of InPP (Figure S4), in which we do not
observe a decrease in selectivity with time. Therefore, we confirm
that the destabilization of immobilized indium protoporphyrin is related
to detachment from the surface. Moreover, the detachment from the
surface takes place in the first 10 min of electrolysis. The adsorption
of the porphyrin on the substrate is through noncovalent π–π
interactions,30,38,39 which is believed to be important for enhanced CO2RR
performance and strongly dependent on the carbon substrate.

We believe that the substrate morphology plays an important role,
as evidenced by the higher CO2 consumption observed with
OLEMS, which can be explained by efficient mass transport effects
due to the more porous structure of PG in comparison to GC or BDD
(Figure S8a), which may also suppress the
HER. These observations are similar to mass transport effects recently
reported for heterogeneous electrocatalysts, showing that the mesostructure
can affect the selectivity and activity of the CO2RR.40,41 Additionally, a typical characteristic of GC is its poor permeability
for gases, which likely affects the mass transport.42 X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy of our substrates
(Figures S9a and S10) indicate typical
characteristics in agreement with the literature. PG and BDD exhibit
sharp XRD peaks, and GC exhibits weak and broad peaks, indicating
a high degree of crystallinity for PG and BDD and a somewhat amorphous
structure for GC.43 The Raman spectra indicate
the characteristic D and G bands for sp2 carbons in PG
and a specific peak associated with sp3 carbon in BDD.
The Raman bands for GC are weaker and less sharp, which indicate disorder
of the graphite lattice for GC.44,45 The low activity and
selectivity on GC may be associated with its poor crystallinity, as
a high crystallinity implies enhanced charge transport, as observed
in covalent organic frameworks.29,46 Recently, crystallinity
has been shown to play an important role in the selectivity of CO2RR on copper phthalocyanine catalysts.47 However, high crystallinity alone is not sufficient for
improved CO2RR catalysis, on the basis of the significant
differences in CO2RR performance between PG and BDD, which
are both highly crystalline.

Apart from the substrate morphology
and surface structure, a plausible
explanation for the enhanced selectivity and activity on PG may be
related to a difference in the effective amount of the porphyrin on
the three substrates. As can be seen in Figure 3c, a difference in the amount of immobilized
InPP on the substrate leads to a difference in activity and selectivity
(details of the corresponding experiments are provided in Figures S1–S3). In the case of PG this
concentration effect is more pronounced and in the case of GC is almost
completely absent, which can be interpreted as a “InPP saturation
limit” that is reached earlier for GC in comparison with PG.
In other words, the PG substrate can accommodate more catalyst in
comparison to GC and BDD. These conclusions are in agreement with
quantitative information obtained from XPS spectra of InPP immobilized
on the different substrates (Figure S12). We also varied the amount of InPP drop-casted on the different
substrates and plotted the indium content as estimated by XPS vs the
amount drop-casted in Figure 3d. The vertical dashed lines indicate the InPP amounts used
for the qualitative study shown in Figure 3c and Figures S1–S3. It can be seen that the indium content is the highest for PG and
the lowest for GC, which is in agreement with our conclusion that
a PG substrate can accommodate more catalyst in comparison to GC.
Furthermore, we used the indium content of InPP immobilized on different
substrates (0.65, .0.49, and 0.58 atom % In on PG, GC, and BDD, respectively) to normalize the
activity to the real amount of adsorbed InPP (Figure 1b–d). It is noteworthy that we assumed
that each immobilized InPP molecule contributes to the electrocatalytic
activity, and since the difference in indium content between the substrates
is small (Figure 3d),
we obtain a reasonably accurate comparison of the activities between
the substrates.

Another cause of the improved CO2RR selectivity may
be a difference in HER activity between the substrates instead of
solely an intrinsic substrate effect specifically related to the CO2RR. In Figure 4a, a comparison between the substrates for the HER and CO2RR is shown. The high overpotential for the HER on the BDD substrate
does not favor the CO2RR, since the CO2RR onset
potential is shifted toward more negative potentials, and the current
is suppressed on InPP-BDD with CO2 in solution. The HPLC
results (Figure 2b)
confirm the formation of HCOOH at more negative potentials on BDD
in comparison to GC and PG. Under argon, where only hydrogen evolution
takes place, the current density on InPP-GC is smaller in comparison
to InPP-PG. However, as shown by OLEMS measurements in Figure 4b, more H2 is produced
on GC. Moreover, in the presence of CO2, the onset potential
is shifted positively for InPP-PG but is almost unchanged for InPP-GC,
which indicates a more efficient catalysis of CO2RR on
PG with respect to GC, in agreement with the online experiments in Figure 2. Consequently, the
GC substrate is more active toward the HER in comparison to PG. These
results indicate that the competition between CO2RR and
HER strongly depends on the nature of the substrate, which in turn
affects HCOOH selectivity.

InPP on different substrates
in 0.1 M phosphate buffer of pH 9.6 under argon and CO2 atmospheres (scan rate 20 mV s–1) and (b) Online
electrochemical mass spectrometry measurement of hydrogen evolution
on InPP immobilized on different substrates.

In order to increase the impact and generality of our findings,
we studied the substrate effect on protoporphyrins with Rh and Sn
metal centers, which previously were found to produce HCOOH.12 Although the HCOOH selectivity for these porphyrins
is much lower than for InPP (which is an intrinsic catalytic effect),
a trend can be observed for the different substrates similar to that
found for InPP (Figure S5). Pyrolytic graphite
substrate leads to the highest FE, while the glassy-carbon substrate
is the least selective toward HCOOH.

The above results demonstrate
the important influence of the substrate,
which is believed to be the result of an interplay of several factors
influencing the selectivity and reactivity of CO2RR, such
as morphology/mesostructure (and thereby optimized mass transport
effects), crystallinity, electrostatic interaction with the molecular
catalyst, and activity for the HER.

Effect of Substrate Pretreatment
In addition to the
nature of the substrate, modification or treatment of the substrate
surface offers a means to influence the CO2 selectivity,
reactivity, and stability. We investigated the influence of a cathodic
and anodic electrochemical pretreatment (“Cat-PG” and
“An-PG”) and a H2 and O2 plasma
treatment (“H2-PG” and “O2-PG”) of the PG substrate. In Figure 5, it is shown that O2 plasma treatment
increases the FE and jHCOOH values. These
effects can be attributed to a change in chemical functionality as
discussed later, instead of an increased surface area as evidenced
by similar Cdl values before and after
O2 plasma treatment (Figure S8b). Since the difference in amount of InPP immobilized on the three
substrates is small (Figure 3d), we assume neglibible differences in indium content on
the various pretreated PG surfaces, and a difference in surface roughness
of the pretreated PG electrodes would have a larger influence on the
measured current, which is taken into account in our discussion. Furthermore,
the exposure time of O2 plasma seems to play a role, as
shown in Figure S6, since a mild O2 plasma treatment (3 and 6 min exposure) slightly improves
the CO2RR, while a harsh O2 plasma treatment
(12 min exposure) worsens CO2RR performance. In Figure 5e, it is shown that
O2 plasma treatment has negligible influence on the stability.
Anodization of PG leads to lower initial FE but improves the stability
dramatically. Moreover, both hydrogen treatments, cathodic and H2 plasma, decrease the selectivity, reactivity, and stability
of CO2RR significantly. Since H2-PG has a lower Cdl value and thus a smaller surface area (Figure S8b), but a higher jtotal value, the observed changes in selectivity and reactivity
do not result from a change in surface area of PG after H2 plasma treatment.

partial current density for H2, and (e) stability during
CO2 reduction on immobilized InPP on different pretreated
PG substrates. Electrolyte: 0.1 M phosphate buffer with pH 9.6. Lines
are given to guide the eye.

The observed differences for the investigated pretreated
PG substrates
highlight the role of oxygenated and hydrogenated functional groups
of the substrate’s surface on the immobilization of InPP and
subsequently on the CO2RR. Our results imply that hydrogen
functional groups on the PG surface strongly decrease CO2RR selectivity, reactivity and stability and oxygen functionalities
increase CO2RR performance. H2 plasma consists
of a large amount of H atoms, which react with surface oxides, leading
to C–H bonds and a decreased O/C ratio on the surface.24,48 The chemisorbed hydrogen on the surface promotes the HER with respect
to the CO2RR, which is reflected in a decrease in FE and jHCOOH and increase in jH2. On the other hand, O2 plasma treatment
increases the amount of oxygen functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl,
carbonyl, carboxylate) on the surface, which generally leads to a
more polar and hydrophilic surface and stronger adsorbate–substrate
interaction. O2 plasma treated PG shows an improvement
in CO2RR selectivity. A similar influence of O2 plasma treatment of the substrate has been reported before for the
oxygen reduction reaction.49

On anodically
treated PG we expected behavior similar to that after
O2 plasma treatment, due to the introduction of oxygenated
species, but no improvement in activity or selectivity has been observed.
However, a remarkable increase in the stability is observed. On the
basis of blank voltammograms of the pretreated PG (Figure S7), there is a significant difference in An-PG in
comparison to the untreated and other pretreated PG electrodes. Application
of strong anodic pretreatment causes a destruction of the carbon surface
and formation of a thick graphite oxide layer, which contains a high
amount of anionic sites and interior void volume, leading to high
surface area, in agreement with the dramatic increase in Cdl for An-PG in Figure S8b.24,50 Complementary information was obtained by X-ray diffractometry,
Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As shown
in Figure S9b, the crystalline nature of
PG remains intact upon electrochemical pretreatment. However, anodization
of PG leads to a significant increase in the Raman peak at ∼1352
cm–1 and a slight increase in the D′ peak
around 1620 cm–1 (Figure S10b). The peak at 1352 cm–1 is attributed to the presence
of graphitic edges, which increases in intensity upon anodic treatment
as observed in our spectra, and the peak at 1620 cm–1 indicates delamination of graphitic planes. Formation of graphite
oxide increases the strain on the PG lattice, leading to fracturization.51 In Figure S11 the
ratio of the D and G band intensities for the different substrates
and pretreated PG is depicted, which clearly shows a high ID/IG ratio in the
case of An-PG. Anodization of PG leads to an increase in the edge
plane density. Note that GC also exhibits a relatively high ID/IG ratio but showed
a poor stability as seen before. Therefore, we believe a high edge
plane density in combination with high crystallinity to be the reason
for the strongly improved stability. The XPS spectra of the plasma
and electrochemically treated pyrolytic graphite electrodes, shown
in Figure S13, provide a quantitative basis
for our conclusions about chemical functionality on CO2RR performance. The oxygen content is significantly higher on An-PG
and O2-PG in comparison to untreated PG. Moreover, the
H2 plasma and cathodically treated PG exhibit fewer surface
oxygenated species in comparison to untreated PG. These results are
in agreement with our interpretation of the CO2RR results
and our Raman spectroscopy experiments.

Effect of Polymer Encapsulation
In addition to pretreating
the substrate, another strategy aimed at improving CO2RR
selectivity, reactivity, and stability is incorporation of the porphyrin
in polymeric matrices. In this work, we compare the influences of
didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), Nafion, poly(4-vinylpyridine)
(P4VP), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate
(PEDOT:PSS). Details about the immobilization in these polymeric matrices
are given in the Supporting Information. The concentration of InPP in the polymer films, and the amount
of polymer drop-casted per cm2 surface were always kept
the same. As depicted in Figure 6, interesting differences are observed between the
polymer membranes. In comparison with polymer-free InPP (InPP-PG),
encapsulation in DDAB, P4VP, and PEDOT:PSS shows enhanced selectivity
and activity, whereas Nafion negatively affects the selectivity and
activity. From Figure 6d it can be seen that the HER activity with P4VP is drastically decreased.
A striking observation in Figure 6e is the enhanced stability when P4VP or PEDOT:PSS
is used in comparison to the other polymers. These results underscore
the importance of the nature of the polymer, as seen before for a
modified bulk silver electrode.52 Enhanced
CO2RR performance by P4VP has been reported before for
cobalt phthalocyanine, where the authors explain the observed effects
by the presence of pyridine residues in the polymer, which influences
the coordination to the catalyst.35,36 Although Nafion-coated
catalysts are widely used for various electrocatalytic systems, negative
effects of Nafion on the catalytic activity have been observed previously.53,54

partial current density for H2, and (e) stability during
CO2 reduction on immobilized InPP in different polymer
membranes. Electrolyte: 0.1 M phosphate buffer with pH 9.6. Lines
are given to guide the eye.

Differences in polymer-dispersed catalysts are generally
associated
with the introduction of a hydrophobic environment, leading to the
suppression of the HER.28,34,55 However, the differences in CO2RR performance in our
investigation are likely to be explained by the different chemical
structures of the polymers (Figure S14),
leading to different substrate/adsorbate interactions. As can be seen
in the blank CVs in Figure S15, the typical
InPP peaks are masked or shifted for Nafion, P4VP, and PEDOT:PSS.
Changes in the voltammetric behavior after immobilization of porphyrins
in DDAB have been reported before, in which the authors also suggest
the possibility of porphyrin dimer formation in DDAB vesicles.55 The absence of InPP redox peaks in the investigated
potential window indicates a change in electrochemical behavior but
does not rule out the presence of InPP on the surface, since reasonable
amounts of HCOOH are produced. The CV of PEDOT:PSS coated PG shows
a much larger double layer, which indicates the strong influence of
the polymer on the chemical environment near the electrode surface.
The polymers without InPP exhibit reasonable CO2RR activity,
as can be seen in Figure S17b, where the
same trend is observed as for InPP encapsulated in the different polymers.
A detailed investigation of the electrocatalytic activity of polymers
for CO2RR is beyond the aim of this work. Nonetheless,
it can be concluded that the observed effects are partially due to
the activity of the polymer for CO2RR, which is higher
with P4VP and PEDOT:PSS. The pyridine group in P4VP and aromatic moieties
in PEDOT:PSS are assumed to play an important role in this respect,
since Dunwell et al. very recently reported CO2RR toward
HCOOH mediated by pyridine.56 The porphyrin
exhibits a planar macrocycle with large π conjugation, which
facilitates electrostatic interactions with the polymer. We believe
that the increased stability is a result of the presence of aromatic
building blocks in P4VP and PEDOT:PSS, which facilitates axial coordination
to the indium metal center by electron donation. This effect is known
for pyridine or imidazole ligands which are used for (covalently)
anchoring catalysts to electrodes and are found to stabilize the coordination
of CO2.34 This interaction is
absent in the case of Nafion and DDAB, leading to a inferior stability
in comparison to the polymer-free InPP, P4VP, and PEDOT:PSS. DDAB
shows an increase in selectivity and activity, which is associated
with the suppression of the HER similarly to previous work.52 The poor CO2RR performance with Nafion
is tentatively ascribed to the low mobility of the porphyrin in the
polymer and a disordered structure of the Nafion layer.53,54 We performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy on the different
polymer-dispersed catalysts to investigate the kinetics of electron-transfer
processes (Figure S16). As discussed in
the Supporting Information, the charge-transfer
resistance between the polymer films is in agreement with the observed
activity in Figure 6b. We conclude that the nature of the polymer affects the rate of
electron transfer during the CO2RR rather than mass transport
of active species, leading to different activities among the polymer
films.

The results in the present work demonstrate that a hydrophobic
environment, induced by the polymer membrane in general, does not
always lead to suppression of the HER activity and subsequent improvement
of CO2RR. Additional effects related to the chemical structure,
allowing for electrostatic interactions with the porphyrin or activity
toward CO2RR by the polymer itself, play an important role.
Note that the current findings strongly depend on the (molecular)
catalyst under study, and one should be careful to generalize the
observed polymer effects for other electrocatalytic systems. Nonetheless,
we emphasize the possible negative influence of Nafion on CO2RR, as Nafion is very often used to immobilize catalysts or as a
binder in the preparation of ink-containing nanoparticulate electrocatalysts.

Conclusion
This work has shown the importance of the nature
of the substrate
for immobilized indium(III) protoporphyrin IX for CO2RR
toward formic acid. For this particular system, a pyrolytic graphite
substrate outperforms glassy carbon and boron-doped diamond in terms
of CO2RR selectivity and reactivity, while boron-doped
diamond shows the best stability. The enhanced activity and selectivity
of PG are assigned to a combination of different factors: first, to
a more porous surface structure, leading to efficient mass transport,
and furthermore, to an optimal interaction between substrate and InPP
and a favorably low HER activity.

We have investigated two strategies
to improve or alter the selectivity,
reactivity, and stability of the CO2RR. Pretreatment of
the substrate before catalyst immobilization and immobilization in
polymeric matrices have been shown to be practical tools to fine-tune
CO2 reduction performance. Hydrogenated functional groups
on the surface decrease the selectivity, activity, and stability,
while (mild) oxygen functionalization positively influences the CO2 reduction performance. Anodization of the graphite surface
substantially increases the stability, which is believed to be related
to the thick graphite oxide layer containing high edge plane density.
Both P4VP and PEDOT:PSS increase the stability, which is believed
to be due to axial coordination of their aromatic moieties to the
indium metal center. DDAB, P4VP, and PEDOT:PSS improve the performance
of the CO2RR, while Nafion affects the CO2RR
negatively. These strategies are assumed to be applicable to similar
macrocyclic catalysts immobilized on carbon materials.

It should
be noted that the CO2RR performance is often
a tradeoff among selectivity, activity, and stability, each of which
can be modified by substrate pretreatment and catalyst encapsulation
in polymers. Although complete mechanistic insight into the pretreatment
and polymer effects is still missing, the results obtained here may
help to design heterogenized molecular catalytic systems for CO2 reduction with specifically optimized properties. Other molecular
catalysts may behave differently; hence, one should be careful generalizing
the results obtained in this study. However, it is very likely that
the substrate, its pretreatment, and catalyst dispersion in polymers
will have an influence on CO2RR performance, and the insight
obtained herein may be used as a starting point for further optimization
of the system.
