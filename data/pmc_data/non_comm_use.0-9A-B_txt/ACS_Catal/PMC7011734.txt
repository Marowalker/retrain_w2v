Different
supporting procedures were followed to alter the nanoparticle–support
interactions (NPSI) in two Co3O4/Al2O3 catalysts, prepared using the reverse micelle technique.
The catalysts were tested in the dry preferential oxidation of carbon
monoxide (CO-PrOx) while their phase stability was monitored using
four complementary in situ techniques, viz., magnet-based characterization,
PXRD, and combined XAS/DRIFTS, as well as quasi in situ XPS,
respectively. The catalyst with weak NPSI achieved higher CO2 yields and selectivities at temperatures below 225 °C compared
to the sample with strong NPSI. However, relatively high degrees of
reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co were reached
between 250 and 350 °C for the same catalyst. The presence of
metallic Co led to the undesired formation of CH4, reaching
a yield of over 90% above 300 °C. The catalyst with strong NPSI
formed very low amounts of metallic Co (less than 1%) and CH4 (yield of up to 20%) even at 350 °C. When the temperature was
decreased from 350 to 50 °C under the reaction gas, both catalysts
were slightly reoxidized and gradually regained their CO oxidation
activity, while the formation of CH4 diminished. The present
study shows a strong relationship between catalyst performance (i.e.,
activity and selectivity) and phase stability, both of which are affected
by the strength of the NPSI. When using a metal oxide as the active
CO-PrOx catalyst, it is important for it to have significant reduction
resistance to avoid the formation of undesired products, e.g., CH4. However, the metal oxide should also be reducible (especially
on the surface) to allow for a complete conversion of CO to CO2 via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism.

1 Introduction
Heterogeneous
catalysts commonly comprise metal or metal oxide
nanoparticles anchored on mechanically and thermally stable carriers
referred to as supports.1 Most supports
are either metal oxides (e.g., SiO2 and Al2O3) or nonoxidic materials (e.g., graphite and SiC) with high
mass-specific surface areas. High surface area is preferred as it
allows for the uniform distribution of nanoparticles on the support
and the deposition of relatively high amounts of the nanoparticles
(or metal loadings), respectively.1 The
support material also helps prevent nanoparticle growth that may be
induced by the high temperatures applied either during catalyst pretreatment/activation
(e.g., calcination or reduction) and/or by the chemical environment
of the catalyzed reaction.2

As a
result of nanoparticle anchoring, certain properties of the
nanoparticles (adsorption and reduction/oxidation capabilities) may
be affected compared to their unsupported counterpart.3 The method used to prepare the supported catalyst and the
nature of the support material chosen also play a significant role
in controlling the final properties of the nanoparticles.4,5 In general, very strong nanoparticle–support interactions
(NPSI) between an oxidic support and oxide nanoparticles usually cause
the reduction of the nanoparticles to be difficult.6−8 For example,
the conventional impregnation of irreducible supports like SiO2 and Al2O3 with an aqueous solution
of cobalt nitrate results in Co3O4-based catalysts
that are relatively hard to reduce to metallic Co in a H2 environment. On the other hand, on reducible supports like CeO2 and ZrO2, the reduction of Co3O4 is thermally less demanding but is still relatively difficult
when compared to the reduction of unsupported Co3O4.6,8

We have previously conducted an in
situ study investigating the
effect of the crystallite size of Al2O3-supported
Co3O4 nanoparticles on the preferential oxidation
of CO (CO-PrOx) in a H2-rich gas mixture.9 CO-PrOx is a promising final step for the removal of trace
amounts of CO in H2-rich streams (e.g., originating from
the consecutive CH4 steam reforming and the water–gas
shift processes) before being fed into proton exchange membrane fuel
cells (PEMFCs) for power generation, as the CO poisons the Pt-based
anode catalyst of PEMFCs.10−12 We were able to show that Co3O4 reduces to CoO and ultimately to metallic Co
at high reaction temperatures and that the reduction is influenced
by crystallite size. This catalyst phase change proved to be unfavorable
as less CO2 was formed, and instead, CH4 was
produced due to the presence of the metallic Co. Co3O4 or specifically the Co3+–Co2+ redox pair is believed to play an important role in the oxidation
of CO.13−15

After observing the phase transformations, we speculated that
introducing
strong NPSI into the Co3O4/Al2O3 system would limit the reduction of Co3O4 and widen the temperature window for the CO-PrOx reaction. In our
previous study,9 the reverse micelle technique
was used to prepare unsupported Co3O4 nanoparticles
of varying sizes. The Al2O3 support was only
contacted with the Co3O4 nanoparticles after
their calcination.9,16 This way, the strength of the
interaction between the support and the nanoparticles could be minimized
to allow for the exclusive study of crystallite size effects. However,
in the present study, two of the four different supporting methods
detailed by Fischer et al.5 to alter the
NPSI were explored. Their approach involved contacting the Al2O3 support with each of the cobalt species [e.g.,
Co(NO3)2, Co(OH)x or Co3O4, respectively] formed during the
different stages of the reverse micelle technique or during catalyst
pretreatment. Therefore, the uniqueness of our work is in how we have
manipulated the interaction between the Co3O4 nanoparticles and the Al2O3 support to influence
the activity and phase stability of Co3O4 during
CO-PrOx. To the best of our knowledge, such a study has not been done
before in the context of CO-PrOx.

The prepared Co3O4/Al2O3 catalysts were then tested
under “dry” CO-PrOx conditions
(i.e., with no H2O and CO2 present in the feed)
and characterized using four complementary in situ techniques, viz.,
powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), magnetometry, and combined X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform
spectroscopy (DRIFTS). PXRD, magnetometry, and XAS are bulk-sensitive
techniques that were used to study the phase changes of the Co3O4/Al2O3 catalysts, and DRIFTS
is a surface-sensitive technique used for the detection of adsorbed
and gas-phase reaction species as a function of temperature and
time. Lastly, quasi-in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was carried out to study the nature of the surface of each catalyst
at selected reaction temperatures.

2 Methods
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
Two supported
catalysts were prepared using the reverse micelle technique, but the
method of supporting the nanoparticles was varied in each case. Each
of the two variations have been described in detail by Fischer et
al.5 The catalysts were named CAT 1 and
CAT 2 to distinguish between the variations made for the support.
See Table 1 for the
composition of the reverse micelle solutions.

a Oil-to-surfactant molar ratio.

b Water-to-surfactant molar ratio.

To prepare CAT 1, an aqueous solution containing Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, reagent
grade
98% purity) was added to a stirring mixture of n-hexane
(AR grade, Kimix) and the nonionic surfactant pentaethylene glycol
dodecylether (PEGDE) (Akzo Nobel) at room temperature and atmospheric
pressure. Thereafter, aqueous NH3 (25 wt %, Kimix) at a
1:4 Co2+:NH3 molar ratio was added to the prepared
reverse micelle solution to initiate the precipitation process, followed
by the dropwise addition of acetone (AR grade, Kimix) to destabilize
the reverse micelles and liberate the green precipitate [most likely
Co(OH)x]. Acetone was further used to
wash the precipitate and rid it of excess surfactant. The precipitate
was allowed to settle and then the supernatant was decanted through
siphoning. The precipitate was dried and calcined at 120 and 200 °C,
respectively. The obtained Co3O4 powder was
redispersed in distilled water under ultrasonication at room temperature
and atmospheric pressure for 60 min, and thereafter, the suspension
was transferred to a preweighed dry powder of Al2O3 (PURALOX, SCCa 5/150, Sasol Germany GmbH: SBET = 162 m2/g, Vpore = 0.47 cm3/g, dpore = 11.5
nm, dparticle = 150–200 μm)
in order to achieve a loading of 10 wt % Co3O4. The water was evaporated under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator.

Unlike in the preparation of CAT 1, obtaining CAT 2 involved the
addition of the Al2O3 support after the precipitation
with NH3 (but before the addition of acetone). The slurry
was stirred for 60 min. After extensive washing of the solid with
acetone, a green [Co(OH)x] precipitate
together with the reddish-pink impregnated Al2O3 support was obtained. The impregnated support was much denser than
the precipitate and, therefore, was separated using a separating funnel.
The precipitate not taken up by the support was not redispersed and
deposited onto the already impregnated support, as this would have
resulted in nanoparticles with different interactions with the support
within the same sample. However, by not depositing the precipitate,
the targeted 10 wt % Co3O4 loading was not achieved.
Nonetheless, the impregnated support was dried and calcined at 120
and 400 °C, respectively. The composition of the reverse micelle
solutions and the subsequent drying and calcination conditions used
were to ensure that the Co3O4 crystallites in
CAT 1 and CAT 2 have similar starting average sizes5 (see also section 3.1).

2.2 Catalyst
Characterization
Powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) was performed in a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray
diffractometer equipped with a cobalt source (λKα1 = 1.788 97 Å) and a position-sensitive detector (Bruker
Vantec). For all samples, the optics were set to parallel beam geometry.
A 2θ range of 20°–120°, step size of 0.043°,
and a time per step of 0.75 s were used, giving a scan time of 29
min, 50 s. All recorded diffraction patterns were compared to known
diffraction patterns from the International Centre for Diffraction
Data PDF-2 database17 to determine the
species present. To further identify phases and obtain the average
crystallite size, Rietveld refinement utilizing the software package
Topas 4.218 was carried out. As the alumina
support material used in this study is known to be present as mixed
phases of γ-Al2O3 and δ-Al2O3 and as the crystal structure of δ-Al2O3 is not known at this stage, an approach for partial
or not known crystal structures (PONKCS), first described by Scarlett
and Madsen,19 was used.

Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was performed for each sample using a Tecnai
F20 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV with a field
emission gun. The obtained micrographs were analyzed using the freeware
ImageJ20 in order to ultimately obtain
average particle sizes and size distributions. The Co3O4 loading was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy
using a LEO 1450 SEM/EDX instrument.

The reducibility of the
individual catalysts was assessed by hydrogen
temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) performed in
a Micromeritics AutoChem 2910 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity
detector (TCD). A 0.1 g portion of freshly prepared supported catalyst
was loaded in a U-tube quartz reactor and heated from 60 to 920 °C
using a 10 °C/min ramp rate in a flow of 5 vol % H2 in Ar [50 mL (NTP)/min].

2.3 In Situ Catalyst Characterization
and Testing
2.3.1 Quasi-in-Situ X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
were performed
on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD photoelectron spectrometer utilizing monochromatic
Al radiation (1486.6 eV photon energy) at the Cardiff Catalysis Institute (part
of Cardiff University, Wales, UK). All data were acquired at a pass
energy and step size of 40 and 0.1 eV, respectively, for high-resolution
spectra and 160 and 1 eV, respectively, for survey scans. Charge compensation
was achieved using the Kratos immersion lens system, and all spectra
were subsequently calibrated to the C(1s) line taken to be 284.8 eV.

For the quasi-in-situ H2-TPR and CO-PrOx experiments,
the samples were first pressed in to disks and placed in a gold-plated
cup before placement into a Kratos catalysis cell and evacuation to
a vacuum of ca. 10–7 mbar. Pure H2 or
the CO-PrOx feed mixture (0.9% CO, 0.9% O2, 50% H2, 40% N2, and 8.2% Ar), respectively, was then flowed
through the cell, controlled with a mass flow controller. The amount
of CAT 1 and CAT 2 used was 0.5 g and the total gas flow was 50 and
30 mL (NTP)/min, respectively, to maintain a constant GHSV of 60 000
mL/gCo3O4·h. The samples were
heated using a PBN heater under gas flow from 50 °C to the desired
temperature, which was held for 1 h. Reaction quenching was achieved
by swapping to Ar to purge the system and cooling down under this
stream. Where there was a mixture of chemical phases after a heat
treatment, their relative concentrations were calculated using CasaXPS
(v2.3.17 PR1.1) after removal of a Shirley background and applying
sensitivity factors from the manufacturer. Line shapes used for fitting
the Co(2p3/2) region were derived from standard materials.

2.3.2 In Situ Magnetometry and PXRD Studies
A low-frequency vibrating sample magnetometer21,22 with a maximum field strength of 2 T [developed at the University
of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa, in collaboration with Sasol Ltd.,
South Africa] and a UCT-developed PXRD capillary cell22−24 mounted on a Bruker D8 Advance Laboratory X-ray diffractometer equipped
with a molybdenum source (λKα1 = 0.7093 Å)
were used for the catalyst-testing experiments. The optics of the
diffractometer were set to parallel beam geometry to minimize possible
peak shifts due to sample height differences (sample displacement).
The magnetometer was specifically designed for the detection of ferromagnetic
and superparamagnetic materials. In the present study, this is only
metallic Co,25 as Co3O426 and CoO27 are antiferromagnetic (see Supporting Information for the definitions of ferromagnetism, superparamagnetism, and antiferromagnetism).
On the other hand, the PXRD can detect the crystalline phases Co3O4, CoO, and Co up to the intrinsic instrument
limitations regarding crystallite size and concentration.

During
catalyst testing in the magnetometer, the temperature was held for
60 min at every 25 °C between 50 and 350 °C during heating
and cooling at a rate of 1 °C/min while magnetization measurements
were taken at a field strength of 2 T every 10 min. The data from
these measurements and those from a previously performed calibration
of a 0.1 g of freshly reduced metallic cobalt sample enabled the calculation
of the degree of reduction, defined as the amount of metallic cobalt
formed relative to the amount of cobalt in the starting material Co3O4 (see Figure S1 as
well as equations S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information). Similarly, PXRD patterns were also recorded during the
60 min holding time every 10 min. A 2θ range of 15°–30°,
a step size of 0.019°, and a time per step of 0.2 s (giving a
scan time of 4 min 2 s) were chosen for each scan.

Both instruments
are based on a single fixed bed reactor and for
the experiments performed in each instrument, the gas composition
and the gas-hourly space velocity (60 000 mL/gCo3O4·h) were kept constant. The reaction mixture
composed of 0.9% CO, 0.9% O2, 52.1% H2, and
balance N2. We note that the amount of O2 added
is in excess of the stoichiometric amount by a factor of 2 to ensure
complete conversion of CO to CO2. The use of a stoichiometric
amount of O2 and other O2:CO ratios will be
the focus in a future publication(s). Also, the gases CO2 and H2O were not co-fed, as the study aimed to investigate
the sole effect of H2 on the catalytic performance and
reduction of Co3O4. The presence of CO2 and H2O may mask this effect. However, the effect of
both H2O and CO2 will also be a topic in a future
publication(s). The amount of the supported catalyst loaded into the
magnetometer reactor was 1.1 g for CAT 1 and 1.7 g for CAT 2 to compensate
for the slight differences in the Co3O4 loadings
(see the EDX results in Table 2), and the gas flow rate was kept at 100 mL (NTP)/min. The
mass of catalyst loaded into the PXRD capillary cell reactor was 0.015
g with the gas flow rate of 1.4 mL (NTP)/min for CAT 1 and 0.9 mL
(NTP)/min for CAT 2.

The products were analyzed
using an Agilent Technologies 490 micro-GC
fitted with three analysis modules equipped with thermal conductivity
detectors for detecting CO, O2, H2, CO2, CH4, and N2. Two molecular sieve 5 Å
PLOT columns of 10 and 20 m lengths were employed to separate the
gases. In the shorter column, Ar was chosen as the carrier gas to
allow for the detection of H2, while H2 was
chosen as the carrier gas in the 20 m column separating O2, N2, CH4, and CO. The third column was a 10
m PoraPlot Q column with H2 as the carrier gas and was
mainly used for the separation and detection of CO2. The
reactor outlet gas was injected into the micro-GC every 5 min throughout
performed reaction experiments. We note that the conversion of H2 was too low to be accurately measured because of the low
amounts of O2 (for H2O formation) and CO (for
CH4 and H2O formation) that were fed.

2.3.3 Combined in Situ XAS/DRIFTS Studies
XAS measurements
were performed at the Co K-edge (7709 eV) on the
B18 beamline at the Diamond Light Source (session SP16006-1), Didcot,
UK. Measurements were performed in transmission mode using a QEXAFS
setup with fast-scanning Si(111) double crystal monochromators for
the Co edge. The time resolution of the spectra reported herein was
95.53 s/spectrum (kmax = 14.8). A DaVinci
arm fitted with Praying Mantis Optics was used to refocus the IR beam
outside the FTIR spectrometer so that the X-ray beam could be transmitted
through the DRIFTS cell. The samples were placed in a previously reported
Harrick X-ray transmission DRIFTS cell attached to the end of the
DaVinci arm.28−30 The XAS/DRIFTS cell has an X-ray path length of 3.17
mm placed 1.04 mm below the surface of the catalyst. DRIFTS spectra
were collected with an Agilent Carey 680 FTIR spectrometer taking
one scan every minute with a resolution of 4 cm–1 using the liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector.

Each sample
was heated from room temperature to 100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min
in helium, which was then replaced with the reaction gas (0.9% CO,
0.9% O2, 52.1% H2, and balance N2) at a flow rate of 4.7 mL (NTP)/min for 0.05 g of CAT 1 and 2.9
mL (NTP)/min for 0.05 g of CAT 2. Upon reaching 100 °C, both
XAS and DRIFTS spectra were recorded over a 1 h duration. Thereafter,
the temperature was changed using a ramp rate of 1 °C/min and
held every 25 °C for 1 h until reaching a maximum temperature
of 350 °C. The cell was cooled back down to 100 °C in a
similar stepwise fashion under the reacting gas as in the heating
ramp. XAS/DRIFTS measurements were taken continuously throughout each
experiment.

For EXAFS (extended X-ray absorption fine structure)
analysis,
all spectra were acquired concurrently with the Co foil placed between It and Iref. The
data processing was performed using IFEFFIT with the Horae package
(Athena and Artemis).31,32 The amplitude reduction factor, S02, was derived from EXAFS data analysis
of the Co foil.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Ex Situ TEM, PXRD, and EDX Analysis
For the various
supporting procedures followed, it was important
to keep the size of the cobalt oxide crystallites in the two catalysts
within a similar narrow size range. This was to allow for the effect(s)
of the NPSI during CO-PrOx to be studied excluding any size effects.
Fischer et al.5 observed that the supporting
procedure followed to obtain CAT 2 results in Co3O4 nanoparticles with a size between 3 and 4 nm, even when the
impregnated support was calcined at 400 °C. On the other hand,
the method used to obtain CAT 1 allows for more flexibility, as sizes
larger than 4 nm can potentially be obtained. This is because the
support is only contacted with the calcined Co3O4 nanoparticles at a later stage in the overall synthesis, and in
doing so, the crystallite size remains unchanged.9,16 Furthermore,
the size of the nanoparticles in CAT 1 is mostly determined by the
composition of the reverse micelle solution, i.e., the oil/water-to-surfactant
ratio and the amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O used. Therefore, the average size of the Co3O4 nanoparticles was set to vary within the narrow range of
3–5 nm, which was achieved by applying a low water to surfactant
ratio in the reverse micelle system, especially in the case of CAT
1 (Table 1).

TEM analysis was used to obtain size distributions and to determine
the average size of the Co3O4 particles. It
should be noted that the images in Figure 1A,B give a relatively poor contrast between
the Co3O4 particles and those of the Al2O3 support; however, number-based particle size
distributions could still be derived and are shown in Figure 1C. The presence of Co3O4 in each catalyst was confirmed with PXRD (Figure 1D), which also yielded
the average volume-based crystallite size. The 2θ range of the
PXRD patterns shown in Figure 1D highlights the differences between the
two supported catalysts and the bare support. As the average crystallite
sizes for each catalyst are below 5 nm, the reflections due to Co3O4 are low in intensity and are partially overlapping
with those of the Al2O3, especially the [311]
reflections at 43° of both phases. However, the presence of Co3O4 in CAT 1 and CAT 2 was ultimately confirmed
by the apparent increase in the intensity of the [311] reflection
relative to the [400] reflection of Al2O3 at
53.7°.

particle size distributions. The white dashed circles show some of
the identified Co3O4 particles. (D) Recorded

Also included is the reference diffraction lines of Co3O4 (ICDD card no.: 01-073-1701).

Summarized in Table 2 are the PXRD- and TEM-derived volume- and number-based average
crystallite
sizes, respectively. The volume-based sizes from PXRD and TEM are
in very good agreement, and similar sizes for both catalysts were
obtained, even though different supporting procedures were followed.
For the full recorded PXRD scans of the catalysts and the support,
as well as the fits obtained after carrying out Rietveld refinement,
see Figure S2 (SI). Table 2 also shows the EDX-derived Co3O4 loading for the different supported catalysts, and Figure S3 (SI) shows the size of the different
regions of each sample that were scanned for the detection of Co,
O, and Al. The loading targeted in each sample was 10 wt %. The method
for preparing CAT 2 did not allow for the complete uptake of Co(OH)x by the Al2O3 support,
as already mentioned in section 2.1.

3.2 H2-TPR and Quasi-in-Situ
XPS Studies
The success of the different supporting methods
in altering the
strength of the NPSI was first assessed using H2-TPR. Figure 2 shows the H2-TPR profiles of CAT 1 and CAT 2. The Co3O4 particles in CAT 1 reduce below 500 °C in multiple reduction
steps. The particles in CAT 2 display two reduction peaks in the temperature
range of 180–350 °C and a separate peak above 750 °C.
Others have also observed similar reduction behavior for Al2O3-supported Co3O4 catalysts as
that seen for CAT 2.5−7 The two low-temperature peaks are generally assigned
to the reduction of weakly bound Co3O4 possibly
forming CoO and metallic Co. The high-temperature peak above 750 °C
can be assigned to the reduction of strongly bound CoOx species or cobalt aluminate-like species (CoxAlyOz).

Figure 2 H2-TPR profiles of CAT 1 and CAT 2.

In the synthesis of CAT 2, some Co2+ ions of the precursor
may have reacted with some of the Al2O3 support
to form these hard-to-reduce species during calcination.5 Alternatively, these species could also be formed
during the H2-TPR experiment due to the presence of the
reduction product H2O.33 As
the temperatures are increased, the Co3+ ions of Co3O4 are reduced to Co2+ ions and some
of these ions could then react with the support. CAT 1 was prepared
from contacting dispersed, precalcined Co3O4 particles with the Al2O3 support, which consequently
minimized the interaction between the particles and the support.5

Quasi-in-situ XPS analysis was performed
during H2-TPR
studying the surface composition of each catalyst after their low-temperature
reduction. As observed from the H2-TPR results (Figure 2), CAT 1 showed most
of its reduction activity below 500 °C, while CAT 2 displayed
reduction behavior below and above this temperature. Figure 3 shows the recorded Co 2p core-level
spectra of CAT 1 and CAT 2 in their oxidic states and after exposure
to H2 at 500 °C. The position of the Co 2p3/2 peak in the spectra of the fresh samples is at 779.7 and 780.4 eV,
respectively, in excellent agreement with values reported in the literature
for pure Co3O4.13,15,34,35 After treatment in
H2, CAT 1 shows the presence of Co2+ in the
form of CoO (781.5 eV) and metallic Co (778.3 eV), respectively, at
a ratio of 45:55, while CAT 2 had a CoO:Co0 ratio of 78:22.

Figure 3 Recorded
Co 2p core level spectra of (A) CAT 1 and (B) CAT 2, after
being treated at 500 °C in pure H2, together with
spectra for their fresh unreduced state (panels C and D, respectively).

The results obtained for both
catalysts indicate that Co3O4 was not completely
converted to metallic Co. In contrast,
during conventional H2-TPR (Figure 2), CAT 1 showed no (or little) reduction
behavior above 500 °C, which implied almost complete reduction
of this catalyst. However, it should be noted that the design of the
cell used for the quasi-in-situ experiments is a “flow-over”
system where the gas mostly passes over the pressed/pelleted sample
and does not penetrate deep into it. On the other hand, the U-tube
reactor used for conventional H2-TPR is a “flow-through”
system where the gas does flow through the packed catalyst bed. These
differences in hydrodynamics could explain the slight disagreement
in the reduction results obtained (especially for CAT 1). Nevertheless,
it is evident that CAT 2 possesses much stronger NPSI compared to
CAT 1.

3.3 In Situ Catalyst Characterization and Testing:
Magnetometry, PXRD, XPS, and Combined XAS/DRIFTS Studies
3.3.1 PXRD, Magnetometry, and XPS
Catalyst
testing was performed in a fixed-bed reactor under dry CO-PrOx conditions
(i.e., in the absence of H2O and CO2) and coupled
with in situ characterization using the previously mentioned magnetometer21,22 and PXRD capillary cell.22−24Figures 4 and 5 show the magnetometry
and PXRD data as well as the calculated average outlet gas flow rates
of CO, O2, CO2, and CH4 as a function
of temperature for CAT 1 and CAT 2. We note that the chosen presentation
of the catalytic data as shown in Figures 4 and 5 gives a clearer
picture of the different reactions taking place (viz., CO oxidation
to CO2, H2 oxidation to H2O (through
the conversion of O2), and CO hydrogenation to CH4) by showing the changing concentrations of all gases being detected
at the reactor outlet. However, the CO2 yield, O2 selectivity to CO2, and CH4 yield are presented
in Figures S4, S5, and S6, respectively,
in the Supporting Information. The catalyst CAT 1 exhibits superior
CO oxidation activity below 225 °C, reaching higher CO2 yields than CAT 2 at all temperatures and achieving the highest
yield (98%) at a temperature of 175 °C. The weak NPSI in CAT
1 are thought to be advantageous in that a higher amount (or surface
area) of the active Co3O4 sites is made available
to the gas reactants instead of strongly interacting with the support.
Also, according to most literature, CO oxidation over Co3O4 is believed to proceed via the Mars–van Krevelen
(MvK) mechanism,13−15,36,37 which requires the Co3O4 surface to be redox
active. Therefore, the high activity of CAT 1 can also be attributed
to the facile reducibility of the (surface) oxide phase.

respectively.

Changes in the degree of reduction calculated from the magnetometer-derived
data. Also shown is a magnified region of the degree of reduction
plot (from 200 °C (heating) to 200 °C (cooling)).

The co-fed O2 is also
consumed in each reaction, with
CAT 1 reaching complete O2 conversion at 200 °C and
CAT 2 achieving a similar conversion at 250 °C. Although complete
O2 conversion is reached at these temperatures, the yields
of CO2 are seen to decrease above 225 °C. This is
an indication of a loss in O2 selectivity to CO2 because of the competing H2 oxidation reaction, which
has proven to be unavoidable even over other catalysts, especially
when O2 is fed in excess of the stoichiometric amount (see section 2.3.2).8−13,ref15,15,35,ref39−38 In addition, CAT 1 reduces from Co3O4 to CoO at 225 °C according to PXRD and to metallic Co
at 250 °C as measured in the magnetometer. Concurrent with the
formation of metallic Co is the undesired formation of CH4, which also competes with the CO oxidation reaction.8,9,35,44,38 We note that the metallic Co phase in CAT
1 is not observed in PXRD because of the overlap between the expected
fcc Co [111] reflection at 20.0° and the alumina [400] reflection
at 20.7°. We also note that at 350 °C, the calculated degree
of reduction of Co3O4 to metallic Co from the
magnetometry data is 22%, which is equivalent to 1.6 wt % of metallic
Co (and 7.4 wt % CoO) in the entire supported sample. This low weight
fraction of the metal in conjunction with the expected small crystallite
size is close to the detection limit of laboratory-based PXRD.

For CAT 2, neither CoO nor metallic Co are observed in PXRD, but
the decrease in the intensity of the Co3O4 [311]
reflection between 250 and 275 °C suggests that this catalyst
was also partially reduced. The magnetometer estimated a very low
degree of reduction to metallic Co for CAT 2 (less than 1%), which
further supports the previously observed and discussed low reducibility
in section 3.2. Although
a low degree of reduction and a low yield of CH4 (21%)
is achieved by CAT 2, the amount of CO exiting the reactor increases
with increasing temperature, which is undesired for H2 fuel
cell applications. This increasing exit of CO indicates that H2 oxidation is favored over the CO oxidation pathway at elevated
temperatures, seeing that O2 is depleted above 250 °C.

Quasi-in-situ XPS was performed after exposing each catalyst to
dry CO-PrOx conditions at 350 °C in the previously described
“flow-over” cell. Figure 6 shows the Co 2p core-level spectra of CAT 1 and CAT
2. At 350 °C CAT 1 contains both CoO and metallic Co at a ratio
of 66:34, while in CAT 2 only the CoO phase is detected (see Figure 6). Despite the XPS
estimating a slightly higher relative metallic Co content than the
magnetometer [a result of the differences in their reactor and gas
flow systems, as well as their depth profile, i.e., bulk sensitivity
(magnetometry) versus surface sensitivity (XPS)], the trends in the
captured reduction behavior remain highly comparable.

Figure 6 Recorded Co 2p core level
spectra of (A) CAT 1 and (B) CAT 2 after
being exposed to dry CO-PrOx conditions at 350 °C.

When cooling the reactor below 350 °C, both
catalysts gradually
recover their CO oxidation activity as CO hydrogenation and H2 oxidation diminish.9,38 Surprisingly, the catalysts
achieve higher CO2 yields (at 225 °C in the case of
CAT 2 and 200 °C in the case of CAT 1) compared to the yields
achieved during the heating steps. According to the magnetometry data,
the amount of metallic Co eventually decreases, which implies reoxidation
of the catalysts. In CAT 2, there is complete disappearance of the
metallic phase at 225 °C, while in CAT 1, the degree of reduction
decreases from 22 to 19% at 200 °C and stays constant until 50
°C. We consider that complete reoxidation of metallic Co was
not achieved because of the high overall H2:O2 partial pressure ratio and perhaps also kinetically hindered due
to the stepwise decrease in temperature from 350 to 50 °C.

PXRD shows the presence of CoO during cooling in CAT 1 but no evidence
of Co3O4 and remains inconclusive in terms of
the presence of these oxides in CAT 2. Nonetheless, it is possible
that the surfaces of these catalysts may contain the active Co3+–Co2+ redox pair required for the oxidation
of CO, which would explain the recovery of the activity upon cooling.
In addition to surface and/or bulk reoxidation, the decreasing temperature
may be kinetically favoring the oxidation of CO over methanation and
H2 oxidation.

From the PXRD, magnetometry, and XPS
studies, the effect of employing
different supporting methods is shown as both catalysts display clear
differences in terms of their CO oxidation activity and Co3O4 phase stability. The catalyst CAT 2, with very strong
NPSI, exhibited greater resistance to reduction (as also observed
during H2-TPR) but was less active than CAT 1 before any
detectable phase changes could occur. The low CO oxidation activity
of CAT 2 is possibly a consequence of having low amounts of surface
Co3O4 sites (or area) available and very low
(surface) reducibility because of the strong NPSI. Therefore, these
studies so far have highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of
either having a highly reducible catalyst or an almost irreducible
one.

Due to the small crystallite sizes and low mass fractions
of Co3O4 (especially in CAT 2), adequate characterization
of the catalysts was challenging. Furthermore, quantification of the
oxide phases was not possible from the PXRD patterns. Therefore, X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to further study the catalysts
during dry CO-PrOx conditions. This technique enables the analysis
of amorphous and crystalline bulk materials with different magnetic
properties (e.g., Co0, CoO, and Co3O4). As PXRD, magnetometry, and XAS are bulk techniques and
full in situ or operando XPS experiments could not be performed, the
XAS studies were coupled with surface-sensitive diffuse reflectance
infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). DRIFTS would reveal
the different adsorbed surface and gas-phase species present as a
function of reaction conditions, which could in turn inform on the
type of cobalt (oxide) surface formed.

3.3.2 Combined
XAS/DRIFTS
Combined XAS/DRIFTS
studies were performed on both catalysts, ramping under the CO-PrOx
reaction gas in a stepwise manner similar to the PXRD and magnetometry
studies. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra
of the fresh CAT 1 sample (i.e., between 50 and 175 °C) are consistent
with cobalt being predominantly in the form of Co3O4. From 200 °C the main edge shifts to lower energy with
the spectra resembling a mixture of CoO and Co between 250 and 350
°C. The presence of CoO is observed from the main feature after
the edge shifting from 7729 to 7726 eV,39,40 and the slight
increase in the feature at 7709 eV is consistent with the formation
of metallic Co39,40 in Figure 7A. A linear combination fit of the XANES
data (Figure S7A, SI) suggests that approximately
30% of the Co is present as Co0, consistent with the 34
and 22% Co0 estimated from the XPS and magnetometry results,
respectively, with the remaining 70% cobalt in the form of CoO. Again,
differences in the hydrodynamics of the utilized sample presentation
devices are expected to result in minor composition differences. However,
from the Fourier transform of the EXAFS data in Figure 7B, there is no evidence of metallic features,
which, as with the PXRD, could be due to the presence of very small
Co0 clusters and/or not bulk-like Co0.

Figure 7 (A) Normalized
XANES spectra and (B) the k2-weighted
Fourier transform of the EXAFS data of the CAT 1
sample during dry CO-PrOx. The reference spectra of Co3O4, CoO, and Co foil are also included. Preparation methods
for Co3O4 and CoO can be found in ref (41).

The fresh CAT 2 sample also resembles Co3O4 below 200 °C, similar to CAT 1. Above this temperature,
the
XANES spectra indicate a transformation to CoO, with a shift in the
main edge toward lower energy and the main feature after the edge
moving toward 7726 eV (Figure 8A). Unlike the CAT 1 sample, no evidence of Co0 is observed from the XANES spectra or from the k2-weighted Fourier transform of the EXAFS data (Figure 8B), which agrees
with the PXRD and XPS studies as well as the catalytic performance
data, where only limited amounts of CH4 (less than 20%
yield) were formed. A linear combination fit of the XANES spectra
(Figure S7B, SI) suggests that at 350 °C
the catalyst contains approximately 20% Co3O4 and 80% CoO. However, the magnetometer, the most sensitive technique
for the detection of metallic cobalt under the given reaction conditions
and sample presentation devices, detected small amounts of metallic
Co, corresponding to a degree of reduction of under 1%.

XANES spectra and (B) the k2-weighted
Fourier transform of the EXAFS data of the CAT 2
sample during dry CO-PrOx. The reference spectra of Co3O4, CoO, CoAl2O4, and Co foil are
also included. The preparation method for CoAl2O4 can be found in ref (43).

The XANES spectra of CAT 2 shown
in Figure 8A from 225
to 350 °C and back to 100
°C exhibit a feature at 7711 eV (also see Figure 9, which highlights this feature at selected
temperatures) not previously observed in the XANES spectra of CAT
1. This feature appears to closely coincide with the metallic Co pre-edge
feature at 7709 eV. However, the assignment of this feature to Co0 may not be accurate, as the magnetometry and gas chromatography
results only show the formation of Co0 and CH4, respectively, at much higher reaction temperatures (above 225 °C).
Referencing to the pre-edge of CoAl2O4 seems
to also rule out the presence of this mixed metal oxide as being the
feature at 7711 eV.

Figure 9 (A) Normalized XANES spectra at selected reaction temperatures
upon heating and (B) a magnified region of the XANES spectra (between
7705 and 7715 eV) recorded during CO-PrOx over CAT 2. The reference
spectra of Co3O4, CoO, CoAl2O4, and Co foil and are also included.

At this stage, without any evidence from the literature,
it is
thought that the feature at 7711 eV may be some other CoxAlyOz species which differs from the bulk CoAl2O4. From the H2-TPR results there are Co-based species
(either formed during calcination or H2-TPR) in CAT 2 requiring
temperatures above 750 °C to reduce, and such reduction behavior
is commonly associated with cobalt aluminate-like species (CoxAlyOz) in Co3O4/Al2O3 (or Co/Al2O3).5−7,33 Furthermore, Tsakoumi et al.42 proposed that Co particles smaller than 5.3 nm may form such species
at the nanoparticle–support interface after reduction in H2. Therefore, it is possible that, during CO-PrOx, CAT 2 forms
small amounts of CoxAlyOz that remain stable above 225
°C and even upon cooling back to 100 °C.

Despite the
presence of an unknown CoxAlyOz phase, Figure 10 shows the results
from the LCF performed at selected temperatures during heating for
both catalysts assuming the presence of Co3O4, CoO, and metallic Co only. It can be seen that CAT 1 shows partial
reduction to CoO and Co0, which is consistent with the
XPS, magnetometry, and PXRD studies. However, CAT 2 shows minimal
reduction, only forming CoO in the XAS studies with small amounts
of Co0 only observed in the analysis of the magnetometry
data.

Figure 10 Results from the linear combination fit of the XANES at selected
temperatures during heating for (A) CAT 1 and (B) CAT 2.

Both surface-adsorbed species and gas-phase species
were monitored
using DRIFTS due to the geometry of the cell.28−30 The formation
of gas-phase CH4 and CO2 was monitored at temperatures
consistent with the GC data shown in Figure 4 for CAT 1. The formation of CO2 from the gas-phase bands at 2360 and 2335 cm–1 8,44 in Figure 11B also follows the trend observed from the GC analysis
during the operando magnetometry and PXRD experiments, reaching a
maximum between 175 and 225 °C. The formation of CH4 in the DRIFTS spectra at 3020 cm–144 is recorded above 250 °C when heating and
disappears below 250 °C when cooling (see Figure 11A), consistent with the formation and reoxidation
of Co0, respectively (see magnetometry and XAS results).

Figure 11 DRIFTS
spectra collected during the CO-PrOx reaction over the CAT
1 sample showing the (A) CH4(g) and formate and (B) CO2(g) and CO(g), as well as the (C) carbonates region.

No adsorbed CO species were observed
in the recorded spectra (even
after subtracting the gas-phase CO band; see Figure S9) as the stretching modes of CO adsorbed on Co0, Co2+, and Co3+ are expected at 2023–2025,
2120–2170, and 2178–2180 cm–1, respectively.14,45 The absence of these bands agrees with previous studies, where only
carbonate species (1700–1200 cm–1) and possibly
formates (2905 cm–1) are reported during CO-PrOx.8,14,15,44,46 It is possible that CO reacts rapidly on
Co3O4 to form carbonates, as has been suggested
in the literature.15 The lack of CO adsorption
bands on Co0 could be due to the limited stability of these
species under flowing gases, as these bands are reported to be easily
removed on evacuation.45

Carbonate
species are, however, observed under CO-PrOx conditions
on CAT 1, as shown in Figure 11C. Monodentate carbonates are assigned to the bands at 1507,
1390, and 1375 cm–1,15,46 which grow
gradually during the reaction, even upon cooling. This gradual growth
in concentration is also observed for the formates at 2905 cm–1.15,46 As these bands do not follow
measured trends in the reactor outlet gas composition, we suggest
that they may be spectator species. Bidentate carbonates (1540, 1249
cm–1)15 are formed above
150 °C and increase in intensity up to 250 °C. This coincides
with the temperature where CO2 production reaches a maximum,
indicating that these species may possibly be involved in the oxidation
reaction.

Similar carbonates were also present in CAT 2 as the
temperature
was increased (see Figure S10A). However,
we note that it is difficult to elucidate the kind of cobalt surface
(i.e., if it is oxidic or metallic) onto which the carbonates are
adsorbed, as their stability could be temperature-dependent and some
may not necessarily partake in the reaction (e.g., monodentates in
the present case). Furthermore, carbonates were also observed on bare
Al2O3 under CO-PrOx conditions (Figure S10B), which implies that the formation
and/or adsorption of these species is not limited to the cobalt surfaces
only.

Therefore, only the bands for the gas-phase species and
bidentate
carbonates provide some information on the nature of the catalyst’s
surface at the different reaction temperatures (together with the
data from XPS, PXRD, magnetometry, and XAS). However, the position
at which the IR spectra were taken along the catalyst bed may have
not been ideal, as there could be different surfaces exposed and,
consequently, different species being adsorbed and detected. It may
be helpful to perform spatially resolved DRIFTS (combined with XAS),47 which might allow for the sample to be analyzed
at different reactor positions and discriminate between different
catalyst surfaces and surface-adsorbed species. Such an experiment
could be performed over both unsupported and supported forms, respectively,
of the catalyst to also investigate the support effect on the presence
and/or adsorption of certain species.

4 Conclusions
The present study has addressed the challenges
faced when using
the transition-metal oxide Co3O4, regarding
its catalytic performance and phase stability under the reducing environment
of CO-PrOx. This was possible through the use of various in situ techniques
that collectively provided very valuable insight into the effect of
nanoparticle–support interaction (NPSI) on the performance
and phase stability of Co3O4. Depending on the
method of preparing the supported catalyst, the strength of the NPSI
can be greatly affected. It was shown that first preparing calcined
Co3O4 nanoparticles and then physically mixing
these with the Al2O3 support in a liquid medium
(as in CAT 1) result in weak NPSI, but contacting the support with
Co(NO3)2·6H2O(aq) within a reverse
microemulsion (as in CAT 2) gives a supported catalyst with much stronger
NPSI. From the kinetic data obtained during the operando CO-PrOx experiments,
weak NPSI favor high CO oxidation activity over unreduced Co3O4, while strong NPSI minimize Co3O4 reduction and the unwanted formation of CH4 at elevated
reaction temperatures. The observations from the in situ analysis
and kinetic data suggest that significant stability of the active
oxide phase is desired; however, the catalyst (surface) needs to be
reducible to some extent, as this is a requirement for the oxidation
of CO over metal oxides via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism.
Therefore, future work can focus on investigating either other support
materials or (oxidation) promoters that can maximize both catalyst
stability and activity.
