Highly
active and stable bimetallic Au–Pd catalysts have been extensively
studied for several liquid-phase oxidation reactions in recent years,
but there are far fewer reports on the use of these catalysts for
low-temperature gas-phase reactions. Here we initially established
the presence of a synergistic effect in a range of bimetallic Au–Pd/CeZrO4 catalysts, by measuring their activity for selective oxidation
of benzyl alcohol. The catalysts were then evaluated for low-temperature
WGS, CO oxidation, and formic acid decomposition, all of which are
believed to be mechanistically related. A strong anti-synergy between Au and Pd was observed for these reactions, whereby the
introduction of Pd to a monometallic Au catalyst resulted in a significant
decrease in catalytic activity. Furthermore, monometallic Pd was more
active than Pd-rich bimetallic catalysts. The nature of the anti-synergy
was probed by several ex situ techniques, which all indicated a growth
in metal nanoparticle size with Pd addition. However, the most definitive
information was provided by in situ CO-DRIFTS, in which CO adsorption
associated with interfacial sites was found to vary with the molar
ratio of the metals and could be correlated with the catalytic activity
of each reaction. As a similar correlation was observed between activity
and the presence of Au0* (as detected by XPS), it is proposed
that peripheral Au0* species form part of the active centers
in the most active catalysts for the three gas-phase reactions. In
contrast, the active sites for the selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol
are generally thought to be electronically modified gold atoms at
the surface of the nanoparticles.

Introduction
Since the early reports
of the high activity of gold as a catalyst for the hydrochlorination
of acetylene1 and low-temperature CO oxidation,2 this precious metal has been shown to catalyze
a wide range of reactions, including the low-temperature water-gas
shift (WGS) reaction,3 the selective hydrogenation
of nitro arenes,4 and the upgrading of
hydrocarbons.5 The addition of Pd to Au
has been shown to yield materials that are significantly more reactive
and stable than their equivalent monometallic catalysts. This synergistic
effect has been observed in several systems, including the direct
synthesis of hydrogen peroxide,6 benzyl
alcohol oxidation,7 glycerol oxidation,8 and vinyl acetate synthesis.9 For CO oxidation and low-temperature WGS there are few
publications relating to supported Au–Pd systems, which is
surprising given their successful application in other oxidation reactions.

There has been a renewed interest in the low-temperature WGS reaction
because of its potential application in CO removal from reformate
in the context of fuel cell technology. Conventional WGS catalysts
based on Cu/ZnO systems are not intrinsically active enough, require
prereduction steps, and are pyrophoric once activated. Alternative
noncopper catalysts are being developed, most notably by Hardacre
and co-workers, who discovered the remarkable activity of Au supported
on CeZrO4.10 However, rapid
deactivation of this catalyst was observed under reaction conditions11 and, although Au dispersed on ceria-based supports
have been widely investigated,12−19 very few Au-containing bimetallic catalysts have been considered
as candidates for this reaction.

The sparse experimental reports
of Au–Pd catalysts for CO oxidation have often focused on nonreducible
supports such as SiO2,20,21 which consequently
makes direct comparisons with reducible supports such as CeZrO4 difficult, as it has been shown that the support identity
is a critical parameter in catalytic activity for CO oxidation.22,23 However, Chen and co-workers recently screened bimetallic Au–Pd/Ce0.62Zr0.38O2 catalysts for CO oxidation
and showed that the addition of Pd leads to a decrease in the catalytic
activity as a result of partial active site blocking.24 Venezia et al. studied a range of SiO2 supported
Au–Pd catalysts and found that, for a nonreducible support
such as SiO2, pure Pd gives the most active catalyst.25 The authors attributed the inactivity of Au-containing
catalysts to the larger size of Au nanoparticles in comparison to
Pd, although the ability of Pd to activate O2 should also
be considered significant. As O2 activation does not occur
on pure Au, it is unsurprising that it is inactive for CO oxidation,
a finding also reported by Huang and co-workers.21 For TiO2-supported Au–Pd catalysts, Beck
et al. used a selection of preparation methods to achieve different
nanostructured bimetallic catalysts. No significant synergy was observed
in those catalysts, regardless of the preparation method, indicating
that the presence of core–shell structures does not adversely
or positively affect the catalytic activity for CO oxidation.26 One possible explanation of this effect is the
segregation of Au and Pd alloys that has been noted in Au–Pd
alloys under various atmospheres, especially under CO exposure, whereby
the strong affinity of CO for Pd causes it to preferentially migrate
to the surface.27

However, this structure
insensitivity was also investigated by Lopez-Sanchez et al. using
Au–Pd/TiO2 materials prepared by colloidal methods.
They studied CO oxidation and concluded that the introduction of Pd
to Au was not beneficial for the catalysis but did not explain the
underlying reasons for the observation.28 Recently, a number of theoretical and model catalyst studies28−30 have predicted that Au–Pd alloy catalysts should be active
for CO oxidation. In a density functional theory study, Ham et al.
attempted to rationalize Au–Pd interactions with CO and O2 on Au–Pd(111) surfaces. Their calculations predicted
that “partially-poisoned” Pd ensembles would facilitate
the activation of O2 and subsequent reaction with CO, making
Au–Pd alloys potentially highly active for CO oxidation.29 The importance of Pd in dissociating O2 has also been reported by Gao et al. in an investigation of model
Au–Pd(100) surfaces.30 Saqlain et
al. conducted a DFT study which predicted that Au and Pd should be
highly active for the WGS reaction, due to the low energy barriers
associated with H2O dissociation and CO oxidation,31 but there have been no reported experimental
studies to confirm this.

Bond recently examined the mechanisms
of the WGS reaction, citing the carboxyl mechanism as a promising
candidate.32 In doing so, he also identified
similarities with formic acid decomposition (FAD), which proceeds
through the same intermediate and is catalyzed by similar gold-supported
systems. Bond suggested that FAD could be a useful test reaction for
WGS catalysts, and he also proposed that gold alloys such as Au–Pd
should be investigated, given their successful application in similar
areas.

Overall there is a body of literature that predicts Au–Pd
catalysts to be highly active for WGS, FAD, and CO oxidation, but
this has not been matched or verified by the existing experimental
reports. The current work aims at investigating the effect of introducing
Pd into a highly active Au/CeZrO4 catalyst for these reactions
and to compare their catalytic activity. As it is well documented
that Au–Pd catalysts display synergy for the selective oxidation
of benzyl alcohol,33−38 a selection of Au–Pd/CeZrO4 catalysts was screened
for this reaction to confirm the presence of the synergistic effect,
before proceeding to the WGS, CO oxidation, and FAD studies.

Experimental
Section
All catalysts were prepared by a deposition–precipitation
(DP) method. Aqueous solutions of HAuCl4 (0.067 M) and
PdCl2 (0.072 M) were used as the metal precursors. Ceria–zirconia
(supplied by Solvay as CeZrO4) was used as the support.
Typically, deionized water (200 cm3) was stirred at 60
°C before the addition of the appropriate metal precursor(s)
to give total target metal loadings of 2 wt %. The appropriate quantity
of support was added to the solution for 15 min before the dropwise
addition of Na2CO3 (0.05 M) to increase the
pH to 8. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 1 h before being
filtered and washed with deionized water (800 cm3). The
catalysts were then dried at 110 °C for 5 h.

The metal
loadings of the catalysts were determined using an Agilent 4100 MP-AES
spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen plasma. A sample of each catalyst
(50 mg) was digested in aqua regia (4 cm3) at ambient temperature
for 16 h, before dilution in deionized water up to a total volume
of 50 cm3. Any remaining solids were filtered before analyzing
the final solution. The measured precious-metal loadings of each catalyst
were invariably lower than the theoretical nominal values, which is
typical for highly dispersed nanoparticle catalysts prepared by deposition–precipitation.
The catalysts are denoted in the Results and Discussion and figures as AuxPdy/CeZrO4, where x and y are the molar percentages of each metal.

XPS was performed
on a Kratos Axis Ultra-DLD photoelectron spectrometer, using monochromated
Al Kα radiation, at 144 W (12 mA × 12 kV) power. High-resolution
and survey scans were performed at pass energies of 40 and 160 eV,
respectively. Magnetically confined charge compensation was used to
minimize sample charging, and the resulting spectra were calibrated
to the C(1s) line at 284.8 eV.

Samples for examination by STEM
were prepared by dry-dispersing the catalyst powder onto a holey carbon
film supported by a 300 mesh copper TEM grid. Bright field (BF) and
high angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM images were taken using
an aberration-corrected JEM ARM-200CF microscope operating at 200
kV. This instrument was also equipped with a JEOL Centurio silicon
drift detector for X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (XEDS). Particle
size distribution analysis was performed from analysis of the HAADF
electron micrographs using ImageJ.

TPR analysis was carried
out on a Thermo TPD/R/O 1100 series instrument equipped with a thermal
conductivity detector (TCD). The catalyst (50 mg) was heated to 800
°C under an atmosphere of 10% H2/Ar (5 °C min–1) after pretreatment at 110 °C in Ar for 45 min.
The instrument was calibrated for quantitative measurements of hydrogen
consumption using different known masses of CuO wires. These were
heated in an atmosphere of 10% H2/Ar to 600 °C (15
°C min–1).

DRIFTS measurements were taken
on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer fitted with a mercury cadmium telluride
(MCT) detector. A sample was loaded into the Praying Mantis high-temperature
(HVC-DRP-4) in situ cell before exposure to N2 and then
1% CO/N2 at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min–1. A background spectrum was obtained using KBr, and measurements
were recorded every 1 min at room temperature. Once the CO adsorption
bands in the DRIFT spectra ceased to increase in size, the gas feed
was changed back to N2 and measurements were repeated until
no change in subsequent spectra was observed.

Nitrogen physisorption
was performed at −196 °C on a Quantachrome Quadrasorb
SI instrument after the sample was evacuated for 2 h at 120 °C.
The surface area was calculated using Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
(BET) theory over the range P/P0 = 0.05–0.2.

Benzyl alcohol (BzOH) oxidation
was carried out at 120 °C in a 50 cm3 glass stirred
reactor. In a typical reaction, 0.02 g of catalyst and 1 g of substrate
were charged into the reactor, which was then purged with oxygen three
times before closing, and the pressure was maintained at 2 atm. The
reactor with the reaction mixture was kept in a heating block, which
was preheated to the reaction temperature. The reaction mixture was
stirred at 1000 rpm using a magnetic bar inside the reactor. After
1 h of reaction, the stirring was stopped and the reactor was rapidly
cooled in an ice bath. After cooling, the reactor was opened slowly
and the contents were centrifuged. An aliquot of the clear supernatant
reaction mixture (0.5 cm3) was diluted with mesitylene
(0.5 cm3, external standard for GC analysis). For the analysis
of the products and calculation of the mass balance, a GC (Varian
Star 3800 with a 30 m CP-Wax 52 CB column) fitted with a flame ionization
detector (FID) was employed.

CO oxidation was performed in a
fixed-bed flow reactor by passing a gas stream of 5000 ppm of CO in
synthetic air over the catalyst (20 mg) at a flow rate of 20 cm3 min–1. The catalyst bed was held at 35
°C using a silicone oil bath, and the CO conversion was measured
using an online Varian 3800 gas chromatography instrument equipped
with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).

Water-gas shift
reactions were performed in a fixed-bed flow reactor equipped with
online Gasmet FT-IR. The catalyst (150 mg) was heated under N2 up to 150 °C at a ramp rate of 8 °C min–1 before switching to a feed of 2% CO, 2% CO2, 7.5% H2O, 8.1% H2, and N2 to balance. The total
flow rate chosen was 100 cm3 min–1, which
corresponded to a GHSV of 52000 h–1. An IR spectrum
was measured every 1 min, and conversion values were calculated on
the basis of the measured consumption of CO.

Formic acid decomposition
was carried out using the same fixed-bed flow reactor as used for
the WGS catalytic testing. A Dreschler bottle containing an aqueous
solution of formic acid (10 wt %) was cooled to 7 °C. N2 was passed through the bottle at a rate of 100 mL min–1, which gave a concentration of 1700 ppm of formic acid with approximately
0.15% H2O in the gas phase. Reactions were carried out
at 85 °C, and 0.05 g of catalyst was used. Gaseous products were
analyzed using an online FTIR system.

To account for the variations
in metal loadings between catalyst samples, the catalytic activity
is expressed throughout this paper as moles of reactant converted
per hour per total moles of metal on the catalyst: e.g., MCO converted h–1 Mmetal–1.

Results
and Discussion
Catalysts were tested for their activity for
CO oxidation, WGS, FAD, and benzyl alcohol oxidation under the conditions
described above. A full list of the catalysts prepared and the characterization
methods carried out on each sample is presented in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The activity measurements
across the range of Au–Pd molar compositions showed significant
differences, which gave rise to two different trends (Figure 1). For the gas-phase reactions
(WGS, CO oxidation, and FAD), the monometallic Au catalyst was the
most active catalyst tested. The introduction of even small quantities
of Pd resulted in a large decrease in catalytic activity. The least
active catalysts tested were Pd-rich bimetallic catalysts with a composition
of Au88Pd12. Significantly, the monometallic
Pd catalyst was always more active than the Pd-rich alloy catalysts,
forming an inverted-volcano plot across the range of bimetallic catalyst
compositions tested.

Figure 1 Catalytic activity of various AuxPdy/CeZrO4 catalysts
for water–gas shift (black ●), CO oxidation (red ◆),
formic acid decomposition (blue ■), and benzyl alcohol oxidation
(green ▲). Activity measurements were recorded after 1 h on
stream.

In contrast, the characteristic
volcano plot expected for these materials was observed for the liquid-phase
selective oxidation of benzyl alcohol (Figure 1). This confirmed the presence of the known
synergistic effect and showed that these supported Au–Pd catalysts
were comparable with those previously reported for selective oxidation
reactions.36

The observation that
WGS, CO oxidation, and FAD have the same activity trend, across the
range of Au–Pd catalyst compositions tested, is remarkable
and suggests an underlying similarity between the reaction pathways.
FAD has been studied for decades, and the mechanism is well understood
in comparison to that of the WGS reaction. It has been widely accepted
that this reaction proceeds through an adsorbed formate, HCOO–, species.39−42 Comparisons have been made previously between WGS
and FAD, notably by Davis and co-workers who studied the two reactions
over Pt/CeO2 catalysts using isotope exchange experiments
and in situ IR spectroscopy.40 They concluded
that a common reaction intermediate and analogous mechanism existed
for the two reactions. Iglesia et al. compared WGS, FAD, and CO oxidation
on Au/Al2O3 and with the aid of electron microscopy
stated that, while WGS and FAD both require atoms or clusters of Au
that were below the imaging resolution of the microscope used in their
work, CO oxidation took place on larger, resolvable particles.43 Our current study, in contradiction to the previous
report, shows that all three reactions vary in the same manner between
the different formulations of Au–Pd bimetallic catalysts, which
implies that the same types of active sites are required for each
reaction. One possible explanation for the discrepancies in the literature
involves the support. In the report by Iglesia et al., Al2O3 was used as the support but this does not have the
redox and H2O-activation properties of CeZrO4. In order to rationalize the catalytic activity trends, the catalysts
were characterized using in situ CO-DRIFTS, TPR, and XPS. Aberration-corrected
STEM was also carried out on a small subset of the CeZrO4-supported catalysts to measure the particle size distributions of
the supported metals and to monitor any structural variations occurring
as a function of changing metal composition.

The CO-DRIFTS spectrum
of each catalyst was measured in the 1800–2200 cm–1 range, which contains the stretching modes of CO adsorbed on Au
and Pd. This technique has been used extensively to probe the surface
of supported precious-metal catalysts.27,44−49 The CO-DRIFTS data for a range of AuxPdy catalysts are presented in Figure 2.

selected Au–Pd/CeZrO4 catalysts: (a) Au; (b) Au93Pd7; (c) Au67Pd33; (d) Au44Pd56; (e) Au12Pd88; (f)
Pd.

The higher wavenumber region of the spectra (2200–2000
cm–1) has previously been assigned to linearly adsorbed
carbonyl species, while features at lower wavenumbers (2000–1800
cm–1) have been assigned to bridged or 3-fold adsorption
of CO on Pd or Au–Pd.48,50 The monometallic Au
catalyst exhibits just one band at 2112 cm–1, caused
by the linear adsorption of CO on Au, consistent with previous findings.51 The monometallic Pd catalyst gives rise to two
distinct features: first, there is an intense band at 2098 cm–1, which corresponds to the linear adsorption of CO
at the corner or edge sites of Pd particles. Second, there is a broad
feature beginning at 1960 cm–1, where 2-fold and
3-fold adsorption of CO on Pd occurs.47,52 It has been
experimentally demonstrated that the linear modes of CO adsorption
on Pd are due to the adsorption of CO molecules at the edge of the
nanoparticle, on undercoordinated Pd species.47,52 The active site of such supported catalysts is generally accepted
to be at the metal–support interface for WGS10 and CO oxidation;53 therefore,
these adsorption modes are mechanistically significant for these reactions.
The nonlinear adsorption modes are typically due to molecules adsorbing
on extended metal surfaces such as the shell of the nanoparticle.
Therefore, the relative contribution of each adsorption mode (the adsorption ratio) should provide a direct indication of
the relative abundance of interfacial and surface sites. (The position
of the linear Pd band, which is seen to vary systematically between
AuxPdy samples,
can be explained by charge transfer from Au to Pd, which is an indication
of the interaction between Au and Pd surface atoms.49,54)

The adsorption ratio was calculated from the integrated area
of each spectral feature. The higher the value, the higher the contribution
of interfacial sites in the sample. Therefore, it would be expected
that samples with smaller particle sizes, but identical metal loadings,
should exhibit higher adsorption ratios. Ouyang et al. implemented
this approach to show that the dilution of Pd by Au was beneficial
for the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide.49 As Figure 3 demonstrates, our most active AuxPdy catalysts for the gas-phase reactions had
the smallest contribution from nonlinear adsorption of CO. This is
clearly consistent with the active sites for these reactions being
located at the metal–support interface, so that those catalysts
that possess the highest relative population of periphery sites at
the exposed particle/support interface (i.e., smaller particles) should
be the most active. Significantly, the monometallic Pd sample had
a higher adsorption ratio than any of the Pd-rich bimetallic catalysts,
an observation that has been
reported previously. Redina et al. examined the CO-DRIFTS spectra
of 0.5 wt % Pd/TiO2 and 0.05 wt % Au–0.5 wt % Pd/TiO2 catalysts and found that the introduction of Au resulted
in an increase in the nonlinear adsorption band in comparison with
the linear band, consistent with these findings and indicative of
a larger mean nanoparticle size. The increase in nonlinear adsorption
bands for their bimetallic sample was thought to be due to bridged
adsorption of CO on Au–Pd species.50 Ouyang et al. also measured the ratio of the linear and nonlinear
adsorption bands and found that the ratio decreases with increasing
Pd content, all the way up to monometallic Pd, although those catalysts
were prepared by incipient-wetness impregnation and were calcined
and reduced prior to analysis.49

Figure 3 Relationship
between the catalytic activity of AuxPdy/CeZrO4 catalysts and the linear/nonlinear
adsorption ratio determined from CO–DRIFTS analysis: (a) WGS
reaction; (b) CO oxidation. Au is not shown, as the CO-adsorption
spectrum is dominated by linear CO-Au species.

Zhu et al. conducted a combined DFT and DRIFTS study that
investigated the mobility and stability of Pd in Au–Pd nanoclusters
in the presence of CO.27 Their findings
showed that Pd preferentially occupies undercoordinated edge sites
and it is these Pd species that strongly adsorb CO. Therefore, the
presence of Pd at the surface causes CO to preferentially adsorb on
Pd, rather than on Au. This explains why the introduction of Pd leads
to such a rapid decrease in activity for CO oxidation and water-gas
shift reactions: first, more surface Pd atoms means that there are
fewer “highly active” Au sites onto which the CO can
adsorb, and second, the stronger affinity of CO for Pd means that
the CO preferentially adsorbs onto a Pd site rather than an Au site.
This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the DRIFT spectrum of Au67Pd33/CeZrO4 which is dominated by CO–Pd adsorption
modes, indicative of a Pd-rich catalyst surface.

As the reducibility
of both ceria and ceria–zirconia have been extensively studied
in the past,55−57 H2-TPR was used to probe the redox properties
of the catalysts, as shown in Figure 4. Our bare CeZrO4 support exhibits a low-temperature
reduction peak at ∼350 °C and another peak at 550 °C,
which correspond to the surface and bulk reduction of the metal oxide,
respectively, which is consistent with previous literature data.56 The lowest-temperature feature on the bare support
material occurs at ∼125 °C and is most likely a contribution
from a surface-adsorbed species such as a carbonate.58 The addition of Au and/or Pd facilitates the surface reduction
of the CeZrO4 support with peaks appearing at 167 and 97
°C for the monometallic Au- and Pd-supported catalysts, respectively.
This phenomenon has been attributed either to spillover of dissociated
hydrogen from the precious metal to the support59 or to an electronic metal–support interaction that
promotes the reducibility of the support.60 The series of bimetallic Au–Pd catalysts exhibits a low-temperature
reduction peak closer to that of pure Pd, even for the Au86Pd14 catalyst, suggesting that even a small quantity of
Pd results in an enhancement in catalyst support reducibility. No
correlation could be found in our systematic sample set between the
temperature of reduction and catalytic activity displayed for the
WGS reaction. This suggests that the mechanistic steps that are facilitated
by the redox properties of the support, such as the activation of
H2O, are not rate-limiting for these catalysts. This finding
is consistent with previous work which has shown that on a CeO2 support having a surface area above 90 m2 g–1 there are sufficient H2O activation sites
to make CO activation more rate controlling.61 The surface area of the CeZrO4 used in this work as measured
using N2 physisorption was 130 m2 g–1. It should be noted, however, that the H2-TPR does show
a correlation between the amount of hydrogen consumed by the catalysts
and the catalytic activity for CO oxidation and WGS (Figure 5). With the exception of the
supported monometallic Pd catalyst, samples that consumed more hydrogen
exhibited a higher catalytic activity. This observation could simply
reflect the differences in the metal dispersion of each catalyst,
such that the larger interface (as detected by the CO adsorption ratio)
resulted in more hydrogen spillover or a higher degree of electronic
metal–support interaction. However, as discussed below, this
explanation does not take into account the metal composition at the
periphery of the nanoparticles. The low activity of the Pd-only catalyst,
despite its high consumption of hydrogen, again is consistent with
the strong binding strength of CO on Pd.

XPS analysis of the AuxPdy catalysts, summarized in Table 1, was used to gain
information primarily on the oxidation state of the Au. It should
be noted that the binding energy of the Au 4f7/2 signal
in each catalyst varied according to the Au:Pd ratio, whereby increasing
Pd content resulted in a lower Au 4f7/2 binding energy,
with the most pronounced shift occurring in the Au8Pd92 catalyst, which exhibited a peak at 83.6 eV in comparison
to 84.1 eV in the monometallic Au catalyst. This Au 4f7/2 shift is due to the electronic modification of the Au species by
Pd and indicates a close interaction between the Au and the Pd.25,62 Similar trends have been observed on SiO2-supported Au–Pd
catalysts, although the magnitudes of such binding energy shifts were
different.25 The magnitude and direction
of the binding energy shift are dependent on both initial and final
state effects, the former of which is affected by the catalyst support;63 therefore, quantitative comparisons between
Au–Pd catalysts on different supports are not meaningful. Analogous
shifts in the binding energy of the Pd species were also observed
and are shown in Table 1.

Figure 6 shows a montage of the peak-fitted Au 4f
XP spectra. Fitting of the spectra revealed that the oxidation states
of Au varied significantly across the range of AuxPdy catalysts, as shown in Table 1. A summary of the
relative proportions of different Au species present are also summarized
in Table 1. In the
Au and AuPd catalysts, there was evidence of Au0 and Au3+ species which correspond to peaks with binding energies
of 84.1 and 86.6 eV, respectively, for the Au catalyst.64−66 In addition, there was evidence of an additional species at 85.1
eV, labeled Au0*. When the concentrations of Au0, Au0*, and Au3+ are compared with the catalytic
activity in WGS and CO oxidation (Figure 7), a strong correlation emerges: catalysts
with higher concentrations of Au0* are much more active
than those with a smaller proportion of Au0*. The assignment
of the feature at 85.1 eV remains controversial. Some previous investigations
have assigned this feature to ionic gold,67 while many others have interpreted this species to be due to small
gold nanoparticles,68−73 with Radnik et al. revealing that significant shifts in the binding
energy are observed in gold particles below 10 nm.74 The STEM-HAADF images and particle size distributions obtained
for the samples in this work (Figures 8–12) in fact show an
abundance of small nanoparticles, and thus the assignment of the peak
at 85.1 eV, labeled as Au0*, as being due to the presence
of small nanoparticles appears to be more plausible. The monometallic
Au exhibited the highest proportion of Au0* in the sample,
with 27% of the detected gold originating from this species. As the
Pd content increased, a significant decrease in the proportion of
Au0* was observed, which could indicate larger particle
sizes. The XPS data presented here are consistent with the TPR data
described earlier, providing further evidence to suggest that significant
variations in metal particle size occur across this range of AuxPdy catalysts.
It should be noted that the same catalysts that consumed large quantities
of hydrogen in the TPR experiments were also observed to have a large
amount of Au0* present according to XPS analysis.

in the unused Au catalyst. The primarily cuboctahedral Au particles
tend to exhibit distinct {111} and {200} -type surface facets and
form planar interfaces with the mixed oxide support grains (Figure 8b–d). A particle
size histogram derived from HAADF image measurements on several hundred
Au particles is presented in Figure 12a and shows that the Au particles have a mean size
of ∼4.45 nm.

monometallic Au catalyst.

Figures 9 and 10 show corresponding electron microscopy data from
the unused bimetallic Au93Pd7 and Au55Pd45 samples, respectively. The supported metal nanoparticles
in both cases were a mixture of cuboctahedral and icosahedral morphologies.
Furthermore, the metal particles in both samples were confirmed by
XEDS analysis to be random alloys of Au and Pd. They also showed evidence
of distinct surface faceting and extended flat interfaces with the
CeZrO4 support grains. It is apparent that the addition
of Pd to Au causes a significant increase in mean particle size. The
addition of only 5% Pd to Au increases the mean particle size from
4.45 to 6.15 nm (Figure 12b). Increasing the Pd fraction up to 45% in the alloy causes
a small additional increase in mean size to 6.45 nm (Figure 12c).

HAADF-STEM images of the unused bimetallic Au93Pd7 catalyst.

Figure 10 Representative BF- and
HAADF-STEM images of the unused bimetallic Au55Pd45 catalyst.

Figure 11 shows some representative STEM images of the unused monometallic
Pd catalyst. In this case, the supported particles were much harder
to visualize, as they were much smaller than the corresponding Au
or Au–Pd particles and exhibited poorer mass contrast against
the CeZrO4 support grains. In fact, as no lattice fringes
were visible, it is impossible to ascertain if they were Pd or PdOx. Careful measurement of particle size from
HAADF-STEM images showed them to have a mean size of only 1.28 nm
(Figure 12d). Overall, the particle size distributions measured
using HAADF-STEM are entirely consistent with the spectroscopic and
TPR data presented earlier, which indicate that the average particle
size of the bimetallic catalysts is larger than that of the monometallic
catalysts.

Conclusions
We have shown that the
introduction of Pd into Au catalysts—intended to enhance activity
and therefore allow the catalysts to be operated at lower temperatures
that favor increased stability—is very detrimental to the catalytic
activity for WGS, FAD, and CO oxidation. Instead of the volcano plot
observed for benzyl alcohol oxidation to benzaldehyde, each of the
gas-phase reactions showed an inverse dependence on Pd content up
to about 30 mol %, before the activity stabilized. Although this anti-synergy
showed a dependence on nanoparticle size, as revealed by the ex situ
techniques, in situ CO-DRIFTS appears to detect the relative populations
of the metal–support periphery adsorption sites and the adsorption
sites on top of the metal particles. This technique proved to be predictive
for catalytic activity for WGS, FAD, and CO oxidation, which not only
supports the notion that the interfacial sites at the metal–support
periphery sites are the most active but is also consistent with the
notion that each of these three reactions require similar active sites.
XPS analysis showed that those samples that exhibited a high proportion
of Au0* species also exhibited a high activity for the
three anti-synergistic reactions.

The electronic interaction
between Pd and Au, which is used to explain the synergy observed for
selective oxidation reactions,7 clearly
does not have a significant role in WGS, FAD, and CO oxidation under
low-temperature gas-phase conditions. Instead, the metal species at
the periphery of the supported nanoparticles are implicated in these
reactions. Rather than describe these species as the active sites,
it is probably more accurate to consider them as components of active centers that are comprised of metal atoms (at the
periphery of the nanoparticles) in close proximity to adsorption sites
on the support material. Thus in the case of the WGS reaction, for
example, CO adsorbed on peripheral metal sites can interact with adjacent
hydroxyl species formed by the activation of H2O on the
support. In this way, the reaction proceeds via a Langmuir–Hinshelwood
mechanism across the metal–support interface. Maximizing and
preserving this interface are, therefore, key objectives in the design
of more active and durable catalysts for WGS and the other related
reactions, which could be integral in catalytic systems for delivering
uncontaminated hydrogen to low-temperature fuel cells. The use of
Pd to stabilize ultrasmall metallic gold particles on CeZrO4, and hence maximize the interface between Au0* and the
support, is not effective in this role, however. The addition of Pd
during preparation of the catalysts results both in the formation
of larger metal nanoparticles and in the less-active Pd sites predominating
at the metal–support interface.
