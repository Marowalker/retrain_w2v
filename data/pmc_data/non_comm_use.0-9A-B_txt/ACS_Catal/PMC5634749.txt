The
nature of the external crystal facets is critical to control
the (photo)catalytic properties. Two-dimensional materials can expose
only one type of crystal facet among zero-dimensional (0D), one-dimensional
(1D), and two-dimensional (2D) materials. Controllable tuning of the
nature of the external crystal facets of 2D materials is highly desirable
but very challenging. Here, we show that 2D particles with the desirable
crystal facet for high-performance photocatalytic H2 generation
can be obtained by using 2D metal oxide materials (i.e., nanosheets
of Ca2Nb3O10 and Ti0.87O2) as templates taking consideration of the crystal configuration
of 2D oxide and target compounds. We demonstrate that anatase TiO2 crystals grown on different nanosheet templates exhibit variations
in photocatalytic hydrogen production rates from aqueous phase methanol
solutions (6.7%), which can be attributed to the nature of the main
crystal facet exposed. In view of the large number of 2D materials
that have already been synthesized, this work offers a key to design
and synthesize nanoparticles with the desirable specific external
crystal facet for (photo)catalysis application.

Engineering
the crystal orientation
is essential for many applications, especially for (photo)catalysts
and lithium ion batteries (LIBs).1,2 For example,
the photoactivity of anatase TiO2 crystals is dependent
on the nature of the exposed crystal facets, where the reactivity
decreases in the order {010} > {101} > {001}.1 In LIBs, LiFePO4 nanoplatelets with crystal
orientation
along the ac and bc facets present
quite different reversible gravimetric capacities at high C-rates.3 The ac oriented crystals deliver
148 mAh g–1 at 10 C-rate, while the bc faceted crystals deliver only 28 mAh g–1.3 So, facile methodologies to synthesize crystallites
with controlled orientation and single facet are highly desirable.
Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been emerging as a promising class
of nanomaterials for various applications, including LIBs,4 supercapacitors,5 photovoltaics,6 catalysis7 and electronics.8 Their 2D nature endows those materials the unique
possibility to expose only a single type of crystal facet, in contrast
to most other low-dimensional materials such as (0D) nanoparticles
and (1D) nanowires. So controllable synthesis of 2D materials with
desirable crystal facets is a very promising approach to achieve high
material performance. However, the challenge is that the state-of-the-art
synthesis methods for crystals in thin film morphologies often lack
control over crystal orientation. To date, the exfoliation method
is the most used synthesis method for 2D nanosheets. The crystal orientation
of 2D nanosheets produced by this method is dictated by their bulk
counterparts.9,10 Even though several new approaches
have been reported to synthesize 2D nanosheets,11,12 controlled manipulation of 2D nanosheets’ crystal orientation
has not been reported.

Recently, it has been shown that metal
oxide nanosheet films are
able to serve as a seed layer for epitaxial growth of functional oxide
thin films by solution and vapor-phase deposition methods.13−15 The crystal orientation of thin films on nanosheets could be controlled
by the nature, more specifically, the 2D lattice parameters of the
nanosheets.13,15,16 The success of employing oxide nanosheets as seed layers for thin
film growth also offers a strategy for the development of nanoparticles
with preferred crystal orientation. Additional advantages of using
2D oxides as templates are their tunable lateral sizes,8,17−19 diversity in composition,9,20,21 and facile synthesis,22−25 which offers ample opportunities
to design and control the final material. Templated synthesis has
been demonstrated as a powerful tool to direct the formation of nanomaterials
into forms that are otherwise difficult to obtain, such as nanospheres,
nanotubes, and nanowires.26−28 Sb2Te3 nanoplatelets
have been reported as templates to synthesize 3D porous nanothread-based
(or nanotube-based) metal and metal telluride nanoplates.29 Recently, Wu et al. reported successful synthesis
of nanoarray/nanosheet 3D structure by using 2D CuS/CdS nanosheets
via wet chemical synthesis.30 However,
most materials need some thermal after-treatment to obtain well-crystallized
material. Hence, a nanosheet seeding technique can lead to successful
formation of crystallographically engineered 2D-like nanoparticles
provided that the nanosheets can survive the conditions during the
wet-chemical synthesis and thermal annealing process steps. Interestingly,
2D oxides have been demonstrated to have much better thermal stability
than their bulk counterparts. The monolayer titanate nanosheets undergo
phase transformation at 800 °C compared to the bulk at 400–500
°C.31 This has motivated us to explore
the controllable manipulation of 2D nanosheets’ crystal orientation
by using nanosheets as templates.

In this article, we demonstrate,
for the first time, that 2D oxide
nanosheets can guide the crystallographic growth direction and yield
2D-like oxide platelets with preferential crystal orientation by employing
a wet-chemical synthesis route followed by calcination (see schematic
in Figure 1a). The
results prove the principle that nanosheets can be used as templates
for the synthesis of 2D particles with preferential orientation, and
that this approach has the obvious advantages of a free and rich choice
of template, ease of synthesis and control over composition and crystal
structure. Two types of 2D oxide nanosheet seed crystals, namely titanate
(Ti0.87O2, further denoted as TO; thickness
0.75 nm) and calcium niobate (Ca2Nb3O10, denoted as CNO; thickness 1.44 nm) nanosheets were synthesized
by chemical exfoliation of their layered bulk counterparts as described
elsewhere.8,22Figure 1b,c show the in-plane crystal configuration of TO and
CNO nanosheets, respectively. The TO nanosheets have a rectangle configuration
with a = 2.97 Å and b = 3.76
Å, while the CNO nanosheets have a square configuration with a = b = 3.86 Å.13 We chose the catalytically active anatase phase of titanium
dioxide as a model material. The anatase is in the tetragonal system,
and the lattice parameters of anatase are a = b = 3.7845 Å, c = 9.5143 Å (see Figure 1d). The largest lattice
mismatch between anatase and TO nanosheets for a or b axis oriented growth is +6.78%, which is much smaller
than the mismatch of +27.42% between c axis-oriented
anatase and TO nanosheets. Hence, c axis oriented
growth of anatase on TO nanosheets is energetically unfavorable. For
CNO nanosheets, the lattice mismatch for c axis oriented
growth of anatase is only −1.96%. Therefore, TO and CNO nanosheets
were therefore expected to promote growth of the anatase phase along
the a or b axis and c axis, respectively.

Anatase crystallites were grown on the TO and CNO nanosheet
seed
layers via a facile synthesis route.32−34 The synthesized NanoSheet
Templated Crystals (NSTC), denoted as TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC crystals,
respectively, were compared with anatase crystallites formed under
similar conditions but in the absence of nanosheets (denoted here
as NO crystals). The morphology and crystal structure of the TO-NSTC,
CNO-NSTC, NO crystals, and the nanosheets were characterized by high-resolution
scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD),
and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Further experimental details can
be found in the Methods section. The HRSEM
images in Figure 2a−e
show that the shape of the TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC crystals is platelet-like
and their thickness is ∼100 nm, while the NO crystals do not
show any 2D-like morphology or surface features. Figure 2a–d show that the size
of the crystallites templated by nanosheets was consistent with the
sizes of the nanosheet templates (see the height profiles of TO and
CNO nanosheets in Figure S1). High-magnification
SEM figures (Figure 2b,d) reveal that the surfaces of both the TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC crystals
are covered with small crystallites. It is noted that peeling off
of the as-grown NSTC crystallites from CNO-NSTC crystals was observed
(see smooth surfaces in Figure 2d), indicating weak bonding between the two interfaces. We
speculate that this behavior is due to weak bonding forces between
the multilayer nanosheets functioning as growth templates. The PXRD
data in Figure 2f show
that all three products consist of the anatase phase. In the CNO-NSTC
crystals, a small peak at 2θ 23.1° is present, which is
attributed to the (100) reflection of CNO nanosheets.8 This indicates that the CNO nanosheets survive in the synthesis
conditions of the CNO-NSTC crystals. No other phases appear as impurities.

The insets in panels a and c show AFM images of as-deposited nanosheets
by Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) deposition; (f) PXRD patterns of
templated and nontemplated anatase crystallites.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM)
was used
to investigate the anatase phase on nanosheets in more detail. Figure 3 shows that the anatase
crystals on TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC nanosheets are polycrystalline with
a crystal size of ∼10 nm. Although the crystal orientation
cannot be observed directly, it is possible to determine the orientation
by observing the crystal planes in the direction normal to the surface.
Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns suggest that the
TO-NSTC crystals mainly expose {100} and {001} crystal facets. The
inset in Figure 3a
shows Fast Fourier transform (FFT) data of a typical pattern of the
crystal plane normal to the observation direction. The observed crystal
planes are listed in the inset image. The presence of (002), (200),
(103), (101), and (204) in the FFT patterns is due to the exposure
of the {100} facet; the presence of (101), (011), (112), and (211)
suggests exposure of the {001} facet (see Figure S2a). The reason for the presence of a small fraction of c-axis oriented crystalline material on TO nanosheets is
probably due to reaction between TO nanosheets and anatase during
the thermal annealing process. The presence of rutile phase in the
TO-NSTC-derived films as a possible reaction product of this interaction
supports this hypothesis (discussed next). On the other hand, the
CNO-NSTC crystals expose the {001} facet as their majority facet,
which gives rise to the crystal planes of (101), (011), (112), and
(211) (see Figure S2b,c). All crystal planes
visible in the inset of Figure 3b, i.e. (101), (011), (112), (200), (211), and (213), are
in agreement with this hypothesis, even though the observation direction
is not along the c axis but under an angle (see Figure S2b,c). The deviation between the observation
direction and the c axis is probably related to the
surface morphology of covering small crystallites.

and (b) CNO-NSTC crystals. Insets in
the upper right corners show fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns
of the whole TEM images. The other insets present the typical FFT
patterns in selected areas of the samples. (c) PXRD of TiO2 thin films grown on Si, TO, and CNO nanosheets.

We confirmed the preferential crystal growth direction on
nanosheets
by growing TiO2 anatase on Langmuir–Blodgett (LB)
monolayer films of nanosheets. Anatase crystals grown on LB films
of TO and CNO nanosheets showed similar results as described above
(Figure 3c). The TO-NSTC
thin film on TO nanosheets showed both (001) and (100) peaks, while
the CNO nanosheets yielded preferentially oriented growth along the
(001) direction. The (101) peaks in both thin film samples are probably
due to lack of full substrate coverage by the nanosheets, so that
some nontemplated crystal growth occurs next to oriented growth. A
small fraction of rutile phase was present in the anatase thin film
on TO nanosheets, but not on CNO nanosheets. Most likely rutile was
formed by transformation of anatase, for which a pure TiO2 phase is required. The absence of rutile in anatase grown on CNO
sheets may be related to the fact that the presence of minor concentrations
of foreign elements in or next to the anatase phase usually inhibits
the phase transformation of anatase into rutile effectively.35

The photocatalytic activity of the three
types of anatase for H2 generation from a mixture of water
and methanol decreased
in the order TO-NSTC > NO > CNO-NSTC, as shown in Figure 4a. The absolute values of H2 production performance for TO-NSTC, NO, and CNO-NSTC are
39.8, 24.4, and 10.0 μmol h–1, respectively.
It is noted that optimization of the experimental conditions such
as the amount of catalyst and Pt is expected to improve these values.
However, the optimization work, falling beyond the scope of this work
for demonstration of rational synthesis of 2D nanoparticles with controlled
external crystal facets, will be shown elsewhere. We first confirmed
the absence of N and F as impurities in all the samples (see Figure S3a–c). We further confirmed by
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) that the Pt concentration in all three samples
was ∼1%. The XPS analysis of Pt particles shows that the Pt
in all three samples has a comparable oxidation state (see Figure S 3d). The chemical state of Ti in the
three types of crystals was slightly different (Figure 4b). The Ti 2p peaks of CNO-NSTC crystals
were shifted to slightly lower binding energy (−0.1 eV), indicating
a small degree of electron gain (reduction) of Ti atoms from surrounding
atoms,36 probably niobium introduced via
the nanosheet templates (see Figure S3b). Furthermore, the specific surface area of CNO-NSTC, 83 m2/g, is much larger than that of TO-NSTC and NO crystals (i.e., 57
and 57 m2/g, respectively; see the BET curves in Figure S4). This result is in good agreement
with the observation that the CNO-NSTC crystals are smaller than the
TO-NSTC crystals (see Figure 2a–e). The distribution of Pt on the TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC
crystals is shown in Figure 4c,d. Pt particles on TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC were mainly found
at the edges of the platelets, especially for CNO-NSTC. Only few Pt
particles were seen on the surface of TO-NSTC crystals (indicated
by red circles in Figure 4c). There are even fewer Pt particles on the surface of CNO-NSTC
crystals. Compared to the TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC crystals, the NO crystals
showed a uniform Pt distribution (see more data in Figure S5).

indicate the location of some of the Pt nanoparticles on the surface
of the platelets.

The distribution of Pt
on the crystal surfaces provides an indication
of the distribution of photoactive sites. The higher the photoactivity
of the surface location is, the more favorable it is for Pt deposition.
It is known that the photoactivity of TiO2 anatase facets
decreases in the order {010} > {101} > {001}.1 Hence, Pt particles are expected to form most easily on
{010} facets.
The distribution of Pt on TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC crystals is consistent
with the crystallographic data that confirmed that TO-NSTC crystals
expose a mixture of {010} and {001} facets, while CNO-NSTC crystals
expose almost exclusively {001} facets. We believe that the higher
photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity of the TO-NSTC crystals
is due to the presence of {010} facets, while the exposure of {001}
facets is responsible for the low photocatalytic performance of CNO-NSTC
crystals. And because of the absence of templates, NO crystals expose
a mixture of facets, including some {010}. So, the photocatalytic
activity of NO crystals is higher than that of CNO-NSTC crystals,
even though some reduction of Ti in CNO-NSTC crystals was observed.37 It is noted that by tuning of the portions of
exposed facets, it may be possible to enhance the photocatalytic activity.38,39 For example, the coexistence of {010} and {001} facets could lead
to higher activity. Further work to control these fractions in these
2D systems is needed to verify this hypothesis. The photocatalytic
activity of TO-NSTC in this work is found to be higher than the anatase
in different morphologies but lower than the nanosheet-anatase with
smaller thickness or doped anatase (see Table S1), indicating the superiority of this strategy.

In
summary, we have demonstrated a facile method to synthesize
2D TiO2 anatase with preferential growth orientation by
using metal oxide nanosheets as a template for nucleation and guided
growth. The photocatalytic activity of anatase can be controlled by
the choice of template, which will lead to the exposure of specific
crystallographic facets. Considering the large number of members in
the 2D materials family,10 we believe that
by proper experimental design this method is also applicable to guide
crystallographic growth direction and thickness of other oxide and
nonoxide compounds, offering rich scenarios for synthesis of crystals
with a single-crystal facet.

Methods
Preparation of TO-NSTC,
CNO-NSTC, and NO Crystals
The
layered phases K0.8Ti1.73Li0.27O4 (KLTO) and KCa2Nb3O10 (KCNO)
were prepared by high temperature sintering of Li2CO3, K2CO3, and TiO2 for KLTO,
and K2CO3, CaCO3, and Nb2O5 for KCNO. The as-obtained particles were protonated
into their solid acid forms H1.07Ti1.73O4 (HTO) and HCa2Nb3O10 (HCNO).
Chemical exfoliation was done in aqueous solution by reacting the
protonated oxides with tetra-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH). The
molar ratio of TBA+/H+ (where H+ refers
to the equivalent number of protons in the protonated oxides) was
4/1 for HTO and 2/1 for HCNO nanosheets.8,22,40 The nominal nanosheet concentration in solution was
5 g/L for both types of nanosheets. For the synthesis of anatase,
(NH4)2TiF6 and H3BO3 were used as precursors. The molar ratio of (NH4)2TiF6/H3BO3 was 1/2,
and the (NH4)2TiF6 concentration
was 0.1 mol/L. After mixing (NH4)2TiF6 and H3BO3 for 5 min in aqueous solution, 45.7
μmol of TO or CNO nanosheets were added. Anatase TiO2 without nanosheets was also prepared for the sake of comparison.
After 2 days of crystal growth, the resulting particles were washed
and collected by filtration. The resulting powders were annealed at
450 °C in air. The final powders made using TO and CNO nanosheets
are denoted as TO-NSTC and CNO-NSTC crystals, respectively. The powders
prepared without nanosheet are denoted as NO crystals.

Photodeposition
of Pt on TiO2 Anatase Crystals and
Hydrogen Generation Test
For Pt deposition, 0.1 g of each
sample was added to a solution containing 30 mL of water and 5 mL
of 420 mg/L chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6). Subsequently,
3 mL of methanol was added, and the system was illuminated under 3.21
mW cm–2 at 375 nm for 5 h. Then, the mixture was
centrifuged (8500 rpm, 10 min) and washed with water three more times.
The powders were dried overnight at 75 °C, so that 1 wt % platinum
loaded samples were obtained.

Hydrogen Detection
The hydrogen formation rate of all
powders was tested by adding 15 mg of powder to a solution containing
water and 6.7 vol % methanol, with a total volume of 15 mL. The reactor
was connected to a gas chromatograph (GC), equipped with a Parabond
Q column (10 m) and a TCD detector to determine the H2 and
O2 concentrations. The solution was purged for ∼1
h in the dark before illumination. Illumination came from an optical
fiber connected to a 120 W high pressure mercury lamp from Dr. Gröbel
UC-Elektronik GmbH, with a spectral range from 280 to 650 nm.

Characterization
High-resolution scanning electron
microscopy (HRSEM; Zeiss MERLIN) was used to acquire information on
the morphology, particle thickness, and Pt distribution. Powder X-ray
diffraction (PXRD) data were acquired on a Bruker D2 PHASER (Cu Kα
radiation with a wavelength of 0.15405 nm). X-ray diffraction patterns
of all the thin film samples were acquired by on a Philips X’Pert
X-ray Diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 0.15405
nm). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a Philips
CM300ST-FEG at 300 kV, with the sample supported on a carbon microgrid.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted
on an Omicron nanotechnology GmbH (Oxford Instruments) Surface Analysis
system with a photon energy of 1486.7 eV (Al Kα X-ray source)
with a scanning step size of 0.1 eV. The pass energy was set to 20
eV. The spectra were corrected using the binding energy of C 1s of the carbon tape as a reference. X-ray fluorescence
spectroscopy (XRF; Philips PW 1480, including FPMulti-software from
Panalytical B. V.) was employed to analyze the elemental composition.
