Dihydrofolate
reductase from Thermotoga maritima (TmDFHFR) is a
dimeric thermophilic enzyme that catalyzes the hydride
transfer from the cofactor NADPH to dihydrofolate less efficiently
than other DHFR enzymes, such as the mesophilic analogue Escherichia
coli DHFR (EcDHFR). Using QM/MM potentials, we show that
the reduced catalytic efficiency of TmDHFR is most likely due to differences
in the amino acid sequence that stabilize the M20 loop in an open
conformation, which prevents the formation of some interactions in
the transition state and increases the number of water molecules in
the active site. However, dimerization provides two advantages to
the thermophilic enzyme: it protects its structure against denaturation
by reducing thermal fluctuations and it provides a less negative activation
entropy, toning down the increase of the activation free energy with
temperature. Our molecular picture is confirmed by the analysis of
the temperature dependence of enzyme kinetic isotope effects in different
DHFR enzymes.

1 Introduction
Detailed
knowledge of the mechanisms employed by enzymes to speed
up chemical processes can serve as a guide for the design of novel
biocatalysts.1 However, many of the factors
that govern the behavior of these amazing catalysts, including the
impact of their protein quaternary structure on catalysis, remain
poorly understood. Comparative studies of dihydrofolate reductase
(DHFR) homologues offer a unique opportunity to elucidate the impact
of protein dimerization on the chemical step.2,3 DHFRs
catalyze the chemical transformation of dihydrofolate (H2F) to tetrahydrofolate (H4F) and due to their crucial
role in protein and DNA synthesis are found in organisms across all
kingdoms of life. H4F is the reduced form of folic acid
and is the primary carrier of C1 units in many important cellular
processes. It is the precursor of derivatives that participate in
a myriad of biosynthetic reactions.4 The
reaction involves hydride transfer from C4 of NADPH to C6 of H2F after a solvent-assisted protonation of N5 of H2F (see Scheme 1).5

Scheme 1 Schematic Description of Chemical Reaction
Catalyzed by DHFR
DHFRs of different organisms share important parts of
their sequences
and most of the residues of their active site are identical. Nevertheless,
whereas the mesophilic EcDHFR, the thermophilic Geobacillus
stearothermophilus DHFR (BsDHFR), and the cold-adapted Moritella profunda DHFR (MpDHFR) are monomeric enzymes that
cannot catalyze hydride transfer at temperatures above 65 °C, the dimeric DHFR from the hyperthermophile Thermatoga maritima (TmDHFR) is active over a wide temperature
range from 278 to well above 338 K.6 The
active form of TmDHFR is formed by two equivalent monomers with independent
active sites and its thermal stability (melting temperature is ∼356
K) is attributed to structural aspects related to surface loops involved
in the contact area between the monomers (see Figure 1).6−8 The catalytic activity of TmDHFR
is relatively low and the turnover number kcat is 10–100-fold lower than that of EcDHFR over the entire
accessible temperature range.9 In monomeric
DHFRs, there are several mobile segments on the protein surface such
as the M20, FG and GH loops, which control the physical steps of the
catalytic process such as substrate binding and product release.10 These loops are capable of switching between
different conformations and this transition is especially important
for the M20 loop due to its proximity to the active site (see Figure 1).11,12 In EcDHFR, the M20 loop is hydrogen bonded to residues in the FG
loop and the two loops show coordinated motions during the catalytic
cycle. In contrast, the FG and M20 loops of TmDHFR are part of the
dimer interface13 rendering this enzyme
less flexible than the monomeric counterparts. Although dimerization
has been proposed as a strategy for enhancing enzymatic thermostability,
its effect on catalysis has not been systematically explored for DHFRs.
The lower catalytic power of enzymes with reduced flexibility such
as TmDHFR has been proposed to support a possible link between protein
dynamics and enzyme catalysis.2,3 However, Warshel and
co-workers proposed that the lower catalytic efficiency is instead
related to a larger reorganization energy needed to attain the transition
state (TS) in the dimeric enzyme.14 Interestingly,
recent analyses of some cold- and warm-adapted enzymes have shown
that surface rigidification, as that observed in the dimer interface
of TmDHFR, tunes the temperature dependence of enzymatic reaction
rates by modifying the balance of the activation entropy and enthalpy,
whereas the activation free energy at room temperature might remain
unaltered.15,16

In all four enzymes, folate and the cofactor NADPH are shown in ball

are highlighted in yellow, red, green, and blue, respectively. The
M20 loop is in the occluded conformation in EcDHFR, BsDHFR, and MpDHFR
but in the open conformation in dimeric TmDHFR, which is the only
conformation that has been observed experimentally for TmDHFR.17,18

A combination of experimental
and computational approaches has
been used to clarify different aspects of biocatalysis including the
relationship between catalysis and enzyme structure and flexibility.
Kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) can be measured experimentally and
predicted by computer simulations; they are one of the most efficient
techniques to shed light onto the intimate aspects of enzymatic catalysis.19 The measurement of KIEs derived from the isotopic
substitution of atoms directly involved in the chemical reaction (primary
KIEs) can be used to propose and support reaction mechanisms at the
molecular level.20−24 More recently, enzyme KIEs (EKIEs), resulting from the isotopic
substitution of 14N, 12C, and nonexchangeable 1H atoms of an enzyme with their heavier stable isotopes (15N, 13C, and 2H) have been used to explore
a possible link between the dynamics of the protein environment and
the substrate during the chemical reaction25−27 and thus can
be useful to investigate the consequences of enzyme dimerization in
catalysis. Isotopic substitution slows protein motions due to the
mass increase, whereas within the Born–Oppenheimer approximation28 the electronic potential energy surface remains
unperturbed. In general, heavy enzymes show a diminution in the rate
constants of the chemical step relative to the light enzyme,6,29−31 rendering information about the influence of the
protein and its dynamics in enzymatic catalysis. Experimental measurements
on enzymatic KIEs have been carried out for several protein systems
such as purine nucleoside phosphorylase,26 HIV protease,32 alanine racemase,33 pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase,34 and several dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs).6,31,35−37 EcDHFR has
been investigated extensively by theoretical and experimental measurmenets
of KIEs, which have revealed the relationship between protein motions
and catalysis.21,31,37−41 Combined in vitro and in silico work of enzyme KIEs has been performed
for wild type EcDHFR31,35 and a catalytically compromised
variant EcDHFR-N23PP/S148A.37 EKIEs were
also measured for BsDHFR,36 MpDHFR,42 and for Homo sapiens DHFR (hDHFR).43,44

Here, we report a theoretical investigation of the effect
of protein
motions on hydride transfer catalyzed by TmDHFR. The results of the
simulations, carried out by means of hybrid QM/MM methods in the framework
of TST,45,46 are compared with those obtained for other
DHFRs6,30,31,35,36,42 and for its hypothetical monomeric version to elucidate the impact
of protein dimerization and flexibility on the rate of hydride transfer.
We have also computed enzymatic KIEs and compared our computational
results with those obtained from previously published experimental
work.6 The temperature dependence of the
EKIEs and its possible correlation with the catalytic power of the
different DHFRs and structural features such as protein flexibility
are explored here in detail, shedding light on the relationship between
protein dynamics, flexibility, and catalytic efficiency.

2 Methods
2.1 Theoretical Framework
The calculation
of the rate constant of the chemical step was based on transition
state theory (TST) with the inclusion of tunneling contributions and
recrossing effects as a preexponential factor. Thus, the equation
to calculate the rate constant can be written as47−49 1  where T is the temperature, kB is the Boltzmann
constant, R is the ideal gas constant, h is Planck’s
constant, ΔGeff(T) corresponds to the effective activation free energy, which includes
all the contributions to the rate constant and can be directly compared
to the value derived from the experimentally measured rate constant.
In eq 1, ΔGactQC represents the quasi-classical activation free energy obtained as
a function of a selected reaction coordinate ξ45 2  where the ΔGactCM(T, ξ) term is
the activation free energy obtained from the classical
potential of mean force (PMF) along the chosen reaction coordinate
(ξ) and ΔGvibQM(T) is a correction
term due to the quantized nature of molecular vibrations (mainly zero-point
energies).45,46,50 In our study, the reaction coordinate is associated to the hydride
transfer from the donor atom (C4) of the cofactor (NADPH) to the substrate’s
acceptor (H2F) atom (C6) and is defined as the antisymmetric
combination between the breaking and forming bond distances (see Figure 2). Following the
explanation of the terms of eq 1, Γ(T,ξ) corresponds to the temperature-dependent
transmission coefficient, which can be expressed as 3

of the QM/MM subsystem, where red points denote the position of the
quantum link atoms.

In eq 3, γ(T,ξ) corresponds
to the classical recrossing transmission
coefficient. This term is always lower than unity and takes into account
the fact that some trajectories crossing the selected dividing surface
(defined as ξ = ξ‡) from the reactants
domain toward the products valley can recross back to the reactants
valley. These recrossings are essentially due to the coupling of other
degrees of freedom to the distinguished reaction coordinate (ξ)51 and can be obtained by means of trajectories
analysis or using Grote–Hynes theory.52 κ(T) corresponds to the tunneling coefficient
that accounts for reactive trajectories that do not reach the classical
threshold energy.45 Both terms of eq 3, γ(T, ξ) and κ(T), are obtained from QM/MM
simulations as detailed in the SI.

2.2 Simulation Details
The initial coordinates
were taken from the X-ray crystal structure of T. maritima DHFR (PDB, 1D1G).12 TmDHFR is a dimeric protein with
164 residues in each of the two monomers. The protonation state of
each residue was determined at pH = 7 using the PropKa 3.1 program
for the whole dimer.53 Once the protonation
state of each critical residue was determined, hydrogen atoms were
added by means of the HBUILD tool included in the fDYNAMO package.54 Then, the system was placed inside a preequilibrated
orthorhombic box of 100 × 60 × 60 Å3 water
molecules centered on the substrate-cofactor pair. Water molecules
within 2.8 Å of any non-hydrogen atom were removed. Five sodium
cations were added in order to neutralize the total charge of the
system and their initial position was selected according to the electrostatic
potential created by the protein. The full system contained 35 949
atoms, including the protein (5354 atoms in total), the substrate
(protonated H2F) and cofactor (NADH) in the active site
of chain A and the cofactor in the active site of chain B (52 atoms
of the substrate and 74 × 2 atoms of the cofactor, 200 atoms
in total), 5 sodium ions, 154 crystal water molecules, and 9976 solvation
water molecules (30 390 atoms). Heavy TmDHFR was prepared in
silico by modifying the masses of all 14N, 12C, and nonexchangeable 1H atoms to those of 15N, 13C, and 2H, respectively. The ratio between
the masses of the simulated heavy and light enzymes was 1.1143, which
corresponds to the 100% isotope incorporation and close to the experimentally
observed molecular weight increase (98%).6

The whole system was divided into a QM part and a MM part
(Figure 2) to perform
combined QM/MM calculations. The quantum subsystem contained 76 atoms,
including parts of the cofactor (nicotinamide ring and ribose) and
the substrate (pteridine ring and the N-methylene-substituted p-aminobenzoyl, pABA) of chain A. Two hydrogen link atoms55 were used to saturate the valence at the QM/MM
boundary. The quantum atoms were described by the AM1 Hamiltonian,56 modified using specific reaction parameters
(denoted as AM1-SRP) developed previously for DHFR by Major and co-workers
that provide excellent activation free energies and geometries.57 The protein atoms, the cofactor of the second
active site, and the ions were described by the OPLS-AA58 force field, whereas water molecules were described
using the TIP3P potential.59 Cutoffs for
the nonbonding interactions were applied using a switching function
within a range of 13.0 to 9.0 Å. Periodic boundary conditions
were employed combined with the minimum image convention in all the
simulations.

One-dimensional PMFs were computed using the antisymmetric
combination
of distances describing the hydride transfer, ξ = d(C4–Ht) – d(Ht–C6), as the reaction coordinate. The umbrella
sampling approach was used60 with the system
restrained to remain close to the desired values of the reaction coordinate
by means of the addition of a harmonic potential with a force constant
of 2500 kJ mol–1 A–2, which allows
good overlap between windows. The reaction coordinate was explored
in a range from – 2.1 to 1.75 Å with a total number of
windows of 55. The probability distributions obtained from MD simulations
within each individual window were combined by means of the weighted
histogram analysis method (WHAM).61 For
each simulation window, 100 ps of relaxation and 100 ps of production
were run with a time step of 0.5 fs in the canonical ensemble (NVT)
using the Langevin–Verlet integrator. This procedure was repeated
for 11 temperatures ranging from 278 to 338 K. Three PMFs were computed
at the AM1-SRP/MM level for each temperature to obtain well-converged
averaged classical mechanical activation free energy barriers. The
classical mechanical activation free energies presented in Table 1 were obtained as
the average of three different PMFs for each of the simulated temperatures
(278, 298, 318 and 338 K) (Figure S1).
For other temperatures, the classical mechanical activation free energy
was obtained from just one PMF.

3 Results
3.1 Activation Free Energies
QM/MM simulations
were run for the light and heavy versions of TmDHFR. All the terms
in eqs 1–3 (see Methods), obtained
at 278, 298, 318, and 338 K, are listed in Table 1. Results obtained at other temperatures
(283, 288, 293, 303, 308, 318, and 328 K) are provided in the Supporting
Information (see Tables S2 and S3).

Our theoretical predictions of the effective free energy barriers
for hydride transfer in TmDHFR underestimate the free energy barrier
by ∼2 kcal·mol–1 calculated from the
experimentally determined rate constants (Table 1) but reproduce the observed increase of
the barrier with temperature. A linear fit of the calculated activation
free energies versus temperature (Figure S2) provides an activation entropy in good agreement with the value
derived from the experimental rate constants,6 −18.8 ± 1 versus −22.6 ± 0.6 cal·mol–1·K–1, respectively. It is interesting
to note that the free energy barrier increases less with temperature
in TmDFHFR than in EcDHFR for which an activation entropy of −26.1
± 0.6 cal·mol–1·K–1 was reported.62 This is related to the
fact that TmDHFR is a warm-adapted enzyme that generally shows larger
activation enthalpies and less negative activation entropies than
its cold-adapted homologues.15,16 Our calculations also
agree with the experimental observation that at room temperature TmDHFR
catalyzes the hydride transfer less efficiently than EcDHFR.17 Using the same theoretical approach, we estimated
that the effective activation free energy barrier in EcDHFR at 298
K is 14.3 kcal·mol–1,31 about 1.5 kcal·mol–1 smaller than that for
the TmDHFR catalyzed reaction.

Dimerization was initially proposed
as the reason for the reduced
catalytic efficiency of TmDHFR.17 However,
kinetic measurements on monomeric and dimeric forms of a TmDHFR variant
in which Val11 was replaced by Asp found that both forms presented
a similar rate for hydride transfer.41 It
was then concluded that the lower rates of the reaction catalyzed
by wild type dimeric TmDHFR relative to that of EcDHFR are not a direct
consequence of dimerization but stem from the modifications that allow
dimerization.63 In order to shed light
on this debate, QM/MM simulations on the hypothetical TmDHFR monomer
were performed using the same theoretical approach as was used for
the dimer. The results at 298 K are presented in Table 2 (see Table S4 for results also at 278 and 318 K) and show that the values
for the free energy barriers of the monomeric and dimeric forms are
identical with the difference of about 0.8 kcal·mol–1 within the statistical uncertainties of the methodology. As mentioned
before, previous theoretical studies predicted significantly smaller
rate constants for the monomeric form18 which is in disagreement with later experimental observations.41 These previous calculations also predicted an
increase in the tunneling transmission coefficient in the monomer
of TmDHFR relative to the dimer, an effect that is not reproduced
in our calculations. Our results confirm that dimerization itself
does not alter the catalytic efficiency at room temperature or the
contribution of tunneling. Instead, dimerization rigidifies some structural
elements of the protein (the loops involved in the dimer interface,
as discussed below), which keeps the structural integrity of the protein
at higher temperatures and shifts the activation enthalpy–entropy
balance to a less negative activation entropy and a larger activation
enthalpy. A linear fit of the activation free energies obtained for
the monomer versus temperature (Figure S3) revealed an activation entropy of −50 ± 3 cal·mol–1·K–1, clearly larger in absolute
value than for the dimer. Although the number of points used in the
fit is small, the observation of an increased value for the activation
entropy in the monomer with respect to the dimer is also supported
by other observations (see below). This effect of dimerization on
the activation entropy–enthalpy balance results in an activation
free energy for the dimeric TmDHFR that increases less steeply with
temperature, providing in this way larger catalytic rate constants
at higher temperatures. This is clearly a beneficial effect of dimerization
for thermophilic enzymes.

3.2 Structural Analysis
The geometries
of the RS and TS in TmDHFR at different simulated temperatures are
provided in Table S5. In general, the description
of the chemical reaction is very similar in TmDHFR and EcDHFR (see Table S6 for averaged geometrical values of EcDHFR),
but the hydride donor–acceptor distance at the RS is slightly
larger for TmDHFR than for EcDHFR with 4.2 ± 0.1 and 3.9 ±
0.2 Å, respectively. This feature, also observed by Warshel and
co-workers,14 can be explained because
the open conformation observed for the M20 loop in TmDHFR allows more
water molecules to enter the active site. This is illustrated in Figure 3 that shows the presence
of water molecules during MD simulations of TmDHFr and EcDHFR and
can be quantified by the radial distribution function around the N5
atom of the substrate (Figure S4). Water
molecules stabilize the RS better than the TS because the charge on
the substrate is more localized. This is reflected in the position
of the first peak of the radial distribution function that is shifted
from 5.1 to 5.4 Å when passing from RS to TS in TmDHFR. In general,
water molecules present in active sites can follow the electronic
changes in the chemical system but at the cost of a larger reorganization
energy, which is then translated into a larger activation free energy
and a lower reaction rate for the chemical reaction.14 This has also been expressed as the importance of “not
being in water for catalysis”.64 Major and co-workers found that the sequestering of water molecules
to the active site of DHFRs is correlated with a larger catalytic
efficiency.65 The less negative activation
entropy found in TmDHFR can also be partly due to the presence of
water molecules in the active site, because these water molecules
become more disordered in TS relative to RS (as demonstrated by the
aforementioned shift in the radial distribution function).

Figure 3 Representative
snapshots of the RS of the hydride transfer catalyzed
by TmDHFR (left side) and EcDHFR (right side).37 Locations of water molecules found during simulations close
to the N5 atom of the substrate are represented by space filling red
balls.

In EcDHFR, the M20 loop is in
a closed conformation during the
hydride transfer step.10,66 In our previous combined theoretical
and experimental EcDHFR work, it was shown how some interactions of
residues belonging to this loop, such as Ala19 and Met20, preferentially
stabilize the TS (for key interatomic distances in EcDHFR see Table S6).37 Impairing
these interactions at the TS, as observed in EcDHFR-N23PP/S148A, reduces
the rate constant by more than an order of magnitude.37 In TmDHFR, the M20 loop appears to be fixed in an open
conformation favored not only by intersubunit but also by intraloop
interactions, such as the hydrogen bond between Ser17 and Trp22 that
does not exist in EcDHFR (there is no a hydrogen bond donor at position
17 in the E. coli enzyme). The closed conformation
prevents the formation of some interactions between the residues of
the M20 loop and the substrate or the cofactor that could stabilize
the TS, as deduced from the comparison of the intermolecular distances
reported in Tables S5 and S6. As a reference,
residue Met20 in EcDHFR approaches the cofactor to about 2.0 ±
0.5 Å when passing from RS to TS, while none of the residues
in TmDHFR see such a displacement. This contributes to the reduction
in the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme by increasing the activation
enthalpy due to the lack of some favorable interactions. The enthalpy
increase is partly compensated by the fact that as less interactions
are established between the substrate and the enzyme the protein is
less stiffened when passing from RS to TS, contributing to a less
negative activation entropy, as determined in the previous section.

Although dimerization itself does not significantly alter the rate
of hydride transfer at room temperature, it is nevertheless important
for the thermal stability of TmDHFR and thus indirectly maintains
its catalytic activity at higher temperatures. Both experimental measurements6 and the simulations presented here (Table 1) reveal that the
activation free energy of TmDHFR increases less steeply with temperature
than for other dihydrofolate reductase catalyzed reactions.62 The values defining the reaction coordinate,
the donor–acceptor distance and the distances for the protein
interactions with the substrate and the cofactor are kept quite constant
over the temperature range investigated here (Table S5). In other words, the active site of TmDHFR is preorganized
for catalysis, albeit less efficiently, than in other DHFRs such as
EcDHFR. This preorganization of TmDHFR is thermally stable, which
appears to be a distinctive feature of this enzyme within the family
of DHFRs.

To investigate the impact of dimerization on the thermal
stability
of the protein structure, we computed the root mean squared fluctuations
(RMSFs) of the Cα atoms of the monomeric and dimeric
versions of TmDHFR at 298 and 338 K (Figure 4). When the temperature increases from 298
to 338 K, the monomer shows a clear increase in the value of the RMSFs,
in particular for the M20, GH, and CD loops. An increase of the temperature
is translated into larger fluctuations of these loops that could eventually
lead to denaturation of the monomeric form at larger temperatures.
This increased flexibility with the temperature is dramatically attenuated
in the dimer. Thus, our simulations suggest that dimerization makes
the whole protein structure more rigid, not only the active site,
and is thus more resistant to melting which is in agreement with the
experimental results. In this way, the catalytic function of TmDHFR
can be preserved at higher temperatures, which is not the case of
EcDHFR or the hypothetical monomeric form of TmDHFR.

Cα atoms obtained after
50 ns of classical MD simulation at the Michaelis complex of the hypothetical
monomer (left) and the dimer (right) of TmDHFR at two temperatures:
298 K (blue lines) and 338 K (red lines).

Analysis of cross-correlation motions between residues for
the
dimeric and monomeric forms of TmDHFR (see Figure S5) reveals a subtle mechanism for the coupling between the
two monomers in the dimer. Dimerization introduces new correlations
between motifs of the different subunits. In particular, strong positive
correlations are observed between loops FG and GH belonging to different
subunits. This is not unexpected because these loops are located in
the dimerization area. Interestingly, the motions of these loops are
correlated with the catalytically important M20 loops. The M20 loops
of the two subunits also display positive cross-correlations between
them. The coupling observed between the motions of the loops of both
subunits could be at the origin of the thermal stability of the dimer
observed in Figure 4. In particular, analysis of the backbone dihedral angles of the
M20 loop shows that this loop can adopt different conformations in
the monomeric and dimeric forms of TmDHFR (see Figure S6).

3.3 Enzyme Kinetic Isotope
Effects
Enzyme
KIEs and their temperature dependence can usually be well reproduced
from the ratio of the corresponding transmission coefficients computed
for the light and heavy enzymes (γLE/γHE). This approach has previously been employed to analyze
with good accuracy the changes in reactivity upon mass alteration
of wild type EcDHFR,35 EcDHFR-N23PP-S148A,37 BsDHFR,36 and MpDHFR.42 As can be seen in Table 1, the transmission coefficients are the only
parameters appearing in the TST rate equation that are significantly
different between the light and heavy versions of the enzyme when
the statistical uncertainties are considered. Within our approach,
the reaction coordinate depends exclusively on the degrees of freedom
of the chemical system (the substrate and the cofactor) and hence
any nonequilibrium effects of protein dynamics should be captured
in this transmission coefficient.

Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of EKIEs
experimentally determined for EcDHFR, BsDHFR, MpDHFR, and TmDHFR (dimer)
together with our theoretical predictions for all of these four enzymes.
In particular, experimental and theoretical values for EcDHFR, BsDHFR,
and MpDHFR were taken from refs (31), (36), and (42), experimental
values for dimeric TmDHFR were taken from ref (6), whereas the theoretical
values of TmDHFR were obtained from the data shown in Tables 1 and S2.

Figure 5 Temperature dependence of experimental (solid red lines) and calculated
(dashed blue lines) EKIEs for EcDHFR, BsDHR, MpDHFR, and TmDHFR. Errors
bars are shown as vertical lines.

The temperature dependence of both experimental and theoretical
EKIEs shows that they are close to unity at the optimum working temperature
of each DHFR enzyme (see Figure 5). EKIEs of EcDHFR (a mesophilic enzyme) approach unity
at room temperature; for BsDHFR (a thermophilic enzyme), this value
is reached at higher temperatures, whereas for MpDHFR (an enzyme from
a cold-adapted organism) the EKIEs approach 1 at low temperature.
All enzymes have been optimized by evolution to work at their physiological
temperatures. This means that their three-dimensional structure is
preorganized to catalyze the chemical reaction, requiring a minimal
amount of reorganization, that is, motions in the enzymatic structure,
to reach the TS at the temperature where the host organism thrives.
If the participation of protein motions is minimized, the change from
a light version of an enzyme to the heavy counterpart has minimal
effects on the reaction rate constants and the EKIEs are close to
unity. If the working temperature is changed, then different conformational
states can become accessible to the enzyme. These conformations will
not have been optimized at nonphysiological temperatures, so that
increased dynamics is required to reach the TS, which in turn will
increase the impact of the protein mass on the reaction rate constant.

The only exception for this general behavior is TmDHFR for which
EKIEs are close to unity over the whole range of temperatures studied
here. In this regard, it is interesting to compare the different behaviors
of two thermophilic enzymes, namely BsDHFR (a moderately thermophilic
monomeric enzyme) and TmDHFR (a hyperthermophilic dimeric enzyme)
(Figure 5). BsDHFR
and TmDHFR follow different strategies in the adaptation to high temperatures.
Thermal adaptation in BsDHFR is achieved by removing themolabile residues
and extending secondary structural elements, which provokes some elements
to become significantly more flexible than in the mesophilic EcDHFR.36 The structure of TmDHFR on the other hand is
less sensitive to an increase in temperature (Figure 4). The most flexible motifs such as the loops
are locked in particular conformations at the dimer interface and
the structural integrity of the enzyme is preserved. As a result,
the participation of protein motions is minimized over the whole range
of temperatures studied and the EKIEs are always close to unity. Another
factor that contributes to the invariance of the EKIEs in TmDHFR is
the increased number of water molecules in the active site. These
are responsible of the environmental reorganization taking place during
the chemical step and are not affected by the change of the mass of
the protein. Their contribution to the reorganization of the active
site during hydride transfer remains unaltered when going from light
to the heavy TmDHFR. Together rigidity of the TmDHFR structure and
the presence of water molecules in the active site explain the observed
invariance of EKIEs with temperature. Interestingly, an in silico
estimation of the solvent KIE as the ratio between the transmission
coefficient obtained in deuterated and normal water, gives a value
of 1.13 ± 0.03, reflecting the impact of the dynamics of active
site water molecules in the chemical step.

4 Conclusions
Theoretical simulations at different temperatures have been used
to rationalize the behavior of TmDHFR as compared to the other variants
of the DHFR family and a hypothetical monomeric form of TmDHFR that
has never been observed experimentally.

The results presented
here show that dimerization is not responsible
for the reduced catalytic efficiency of TmDHFR; the reduced efficiency
is likely to be a consequence of changes introduced in the primary
sequence of TmDHFR that stabilize the dimer. The M20 loop is central
to rationalize the differences between TmDHFR and other members of
the DHFRS family. In TmDHFR, it is in the open form preventing the
formation of some stabilizing interactions in the TS found in EcDHFR.
In addition, the open conformation allows more water molecules to
enter the active site of TmDHFR. These water molecules stabilize RS
relative to TS and this is reflected in a larger change in the hydride
donor–acceptor distance when going from the RS to the TS. This
effect contributes to the increase in the free energy barrier of the
reaction. The presence of water molecules also helps diminish the
absolute value of the activation entropy, a property of TmDHFR that
makes it more catalytically competent at high temperatures.

Dimerization confers on TmDHFR the ability to remain catalytically
active at high temperatures. The RMSFs of TmDHFR show a reduced flexibility
of the dimeric form compared to the monomer. This reduction is more
evident at higher temperatures, where thermal fluctuations can lead
to unfolding of the enzyme. However, some protein flexibility is a
prerequisite for the reaction so that the active site can accommodate
the charge redistribution on the path to the TS.37 The absence of flexibility in TmDHFR can be partially compensated
by an active site that seems to be almost completely preorganized
in the Michaelis complex. No significant changes are observed when
comparing protein–substrate distances at RS and TS at different
temperatures; this means that the pattern of protein interactions
with the chemical system, despite not being as optimal as in other
DHFRs, are already present in the Michaelis complex.

This picture
of the role of protein flexibility in catalysis in
TmDHFR is corroborated by the analysis of EKIEs. Analysis of the temperature
dependence of both experimental and theoretical EKIEs obtained for
other DHFRs shows that a value close to unity is reached at their
respective physiological temperatures; the values of the enzyme KIEs
increase when moving toward nonphysiological temperatures. In the
hyperthermophilic TmDHFR on the other hand, EKIEs remain close to
unity over the whole temperature range, indicating a minor participation
of protein motions during barrier crossing.
