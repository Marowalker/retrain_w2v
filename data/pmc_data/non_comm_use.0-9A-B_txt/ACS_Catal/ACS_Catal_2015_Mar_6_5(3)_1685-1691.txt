Cytochrome P450 enzymes can effectively
promote the activation
and cyclization of carbonazidate substrates to yield oxazolidinones
via an intramolecular nitrene C–H insertion reaction. Investigation
of the substrate scope shows that while benzylic/allylic C–H
bonds are most readily aminated by these biocatalysts, stronger, secondary
C–H bonds are also accessible to functionalization. Leveraging
this “non-native” reactivity and assisted by fingerprint-based
predictions, improved active-site variants of the bacterial P450 CYP102A1
could be identified to mediate the aminofunctionalization of two terpene
natural products with high regio- and stereoselectivity. Mechanistic
studies and KIE experiments show that the C–H activation step
in these reactions is rate-limiting and proceeds in a stepwise manner,
namely, via hydrogen atom abstraction followed by radical recombination.
This study expands the reactivity scope of P450-based catalysts in
the context of nitrene transfer transformations and provides first-time
insights into the mechanism of P450-catalyzed C–H amination
reactions.

1 Introduction
Expanding
the scope of protein-based catalysts beyond the reaction
space encompassed by natural enzymes constitutes an important, and
increasingly sought-after goal in biocatalysis.1−11 A synthetically most valuable transformation is the direct functionalization
of aliphatic C–H bonds, which occur ubiquitously in man-made
and natural compounds. Of particular interest are methods for the
direct conversion of aliphatic C–H bonds into C–N bonds,
owing to the abundance of nitrogen functionalities in biologically
active molecules.12,13 Accordingly, significant efforts
have been devoted over the past several years to the development of
synthetic transition metal catalysts to promote C(sp3)—H amination transformations, especially via
nitrene C–H insertion.14−18 In stark contrast, natural enzymes capable of supporting C(sp3)—H amination chemistry via direct
C–H bond functionalization are extremely rare (e.g., SAM-dependent
lysine 2,3-aminomutase)19 and none is known
to catalyze nitrene C–H insertion reactions. This “gap”
prompted us and others to develop engineered and artificial biocatalytic
systems for promoting this transformation.7,20−22 In independent studies, our laboratory and the Arnold
group demonstrated that engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes containing
either a cysteine-7 or a serine-ligated
heme20 can catalyze the intramolecular
C–H amination of arylsulfonyl azides with high catalytic efficiency
and selectivity. More recently, activation of arylsulfonyl azide substrates
for intramolecular C–H amination using alternative hemoprotein-based
catalysts21 as well as for intermolecular
sulfimidation23 was reported.

Based
on the promising nitrene transfer reactivity exhibited by
engineered variants of CYP102A1 (P450BM3)24 with arylsulfonyl azides,7 we
envisioned the possibility to exploit P450 catalysts for engaging
alternative nitrene donors in intramolecular C–H amination
processes. In this regard, the construction of oxalidinone rings via
cyclative nitrene C–H insertion25−27 is of particular relevance
as these compounds can provide rapid access, upon hydrolysis, to valuable
(chiral) 1,2-aminoalcohols, key functional motifs in many bioactive
molecules28 and chiral auxiliaries.29 To date, this type of transformation has been
achieved with rhodium or silver-based catalysts in the presence of
carbamate-derived iminoiodinanes25,26 or N-tosyloxycarbamates27 as the
substrates. Compared to the latter, organic azides represent considerably
more attractive nitrene precursors, owing to their high atom economy
and the release of environmentally benign N2 gas as the
byproduct of the amination reaction.18,30 Here, we report
that engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes can effectively catalyze the
cyclization of carbonazidate substrates to yield oxazolidinones via
an intramolecular C–H amination reaction.

and carbamate products are provided as Supporting Information.

2.2 Protein Expression and
Purification
Wild-type CYP102A1 and its engineered variants
were expressed from
pCWori-based plasmids containing the P450 gene under the control of
an IPTG-inducible promoter (BamHI/EcoRI cassette) according to procedures described previously.31 Typically, cultures of recombinant DH5α
cells were grown at 37 °C (200 rpm) in Terrific Broth (TB) medium
supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/L) until OD600 reached
1.0 and then induced with 0.25 mM β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) and 0.3 mM δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). After induction,
cultures were shaken at 150 rpm and 27 °C and harvested after
20 h by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. Cell lysates were
prepared by sonication and loaded on Q Sepharose resin. P450s were
eluted using 20 mM Tris, 340 mM NaCl, pH 8.0. After buffer exchange
(50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0), the enzymes were stored at −80 °C.
P450 concentration was determined from CO-binding difference spectra
(ε450–490 = 91 000 M–1 cm–1). The vector encoding for the thermostable
phosphite dehydrogenase (PTDH) variant Opt13 was kindly provided by
the Zhao group.32 PTDH was overexpressed
from pET-15b-based vector in BL21(DE3) cells and purified using Ni-affinity
chromatography according to the published procedure.32

2.3 P450 Reactions
The enzymatic reactions
were carried out at a 400 μL-scale using 5–20 μM
purified P450 and 10 mM substrate in the presence of a PTDH-based
cofactor regeneration system (1 μM PTDH, 100 μM NADP+, 50 mM sodium phosphite). In a typical procedure, a solution
containing the cofactor regeneration system in potassium phosphate
buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) was degassed by bubbling argon into the mixture
for 5 min in a sealed vial. A buffered solution containing the P450
enzyme was carefully degassed in a similar manner in a separate vial.
The two solutions were then mixed together via cannulation. Reactions
were initiated by addition of 8 μL of azide (from a 0.5 M stock
solution in methanol) with a syringe, and the reaction mixture was
stirred for 16 h at room temperature under positive argon pressure.
Control reactions with hemin were conducted following an identical
procedure with the difference that the P450 was replaced by 80 μL
of a hemin solution (100 μM in DMSO:H2O, 1:1) and
sodium dithionite (10 mM) was used as the reductant. Prior to chromatographic
analysis (see Analytical Methods below),
the reaction mixtures were extracted with 400 μL CH2Cl2, followed by evaporation of the organic layer and
dissolution of the residue in 100 μL MeOH. Calibration curves
for quantification of the different oxazolidinones (Figure S4) were generated using authentic standards produced
synthetically (see Synthetic Procedures in SI). All measurements were performed in triplicate. For each experiment,
negative control samples containing either no enzyme or no reductant
were included. For the CO-inactivation experiment, carbon monoxide
was bubbled through the reaction mixture containing the P450 enzyme
and sodium dithionite prior to addition of the azide substrate. For
the natural product substrates (menthol- and borneol-derived carbonazidates),
the reaction was quenched by adding excess dithionite, followed by
stirring for 24 h before the addition of internal standard and extraction
with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was then analyzed
by GC-MS.

2.4 Analytical Methods
GC/MS analyses
were performed on a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 equipped with a RTX-XLB column
(30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.28 μm) and a quadrupole mass analyzer.
Separation method: 1 μL injection, inj. temp.: 250 °C,
detector temp.: 220 °C. Gradient: column temperature set at 50
°C for 1 min, then to 280 °C at 30 °C/min, then to280
°C for 4 min. Total run time was 13.67 min. Enantiomeric excess
was determined by chiral gas chromatography (GC) using a Shimadzu
GC-2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a FID detector and a Agilent
CYCLOSIL-B column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film).
Separation method for 4-methyl-4-(p-tolyl)oxazolidin-2-one (15): 1 μL injection, injector temp.: 200 °C, detector
temp: 300 °C. Gradient: column temperature set at 150 °C
for 0 min, then to 200 °C at 4.5 °C/min, then to 230 °C
at 1.5 °C/min, then to 245 °C at 15 °C/min for 8 min.
Separation method for 4-phenyloxazolidin-2-one (20):
1 μL injection, injector temp.: 200 °C, detector temp:
300 °C. Gradient: column temperature set at 150 °C for 0
min, then to 200 °C at 4.5 °C/min, then to 220 °C at
1 °C/min, then to 245 °C at 15 °C/min for 8 min. HPLC
analyses were performed using a Shimadzu LC-2010A-HT equipped with
a VisionHT-C18 reverse-phase column and a multidiode UV–VIS
detector. Injection volume: 10 uL. Flow rate: 1 mL/min. Gradient:
10% acetonitrile in water (0.1% TFA) for 3 min, then increased to
90% over 24 min.

2.5 Kinetic Isotope Effect
(KIE) Experiments
P450 reactions were carried out at a 400
μL-scale using 20
μM P450, 10 mM NADPH and stopped after 1 h. For KIE determination
with 6 and D-6, parallel reactions with
either of the carbonazidate substrates were carried out at varying
substrate concentration (100 μM to 2 mM). The reactions were
analyzed by HPLC and KIE values were calculated from the resulting
plots of initial rate against substrate concentration. For the intra-
and intermolecular KIE analyses with D1-11 and with equimolar mixtures of 11 and D2-11, respectively,
the reactions were carried out as described above using 10 mM total
substrate concentration, followed by GC-MS analysis. KIE values were
determined based on the ratios between the relative abundances of
the characteristic fragments with m/z of 105 (nondeuterated) and m/z of 106 (deuterated) (Figure S5). Authentic
standards of product 20 and D-20 injected
individually and in equimolar mixture were used as references (Figure S5).

3 Results
and Discussion
In preliminary experiments, a series of oxycarbonyl-based
nitrene
donors were prepared using 2-phenylpropanol derivatives as model substrates
(Table 1). These compounds comprised acetoxy-
(1) and aryloxy-carbamate (2, 3) derivatives, which have been previously investigated in the context
of rhodium-catalyzed nitrene transfer reactions.27 Given the ability of P450s to activate sulfonyl azides,7 the carbonazidate derivative 4 was
also synthesized. In addition to being readily accessible from a synthetic
standpoint, carbonazidates are most desirable precursors for oxazolidinone
formation via nitrene C–H insertion because of their high atom
economy, with N2 being produced as byproduct as opposed
to AcOH or ArOH with 2 or 3. Despite these
favorable features and the successful application of carbonazidates
in the context of sulfimidation,33,34 olefin aziridination,35,36 and aminohalogenation,33,37 catalytic intramolecular
C–H amination reactions involving these compounds have not
been reported to our knowledge. CYP102A1 variant FL#62 was chosen
for the initial scouting experiments. Compared to wild-type CYP102A1,
FL#62 contains five active site mutations (V78A, F81S, A82 V, F87A,
A184 V), which contribute to expand its active site and make it accessible
to large and bulky substrates.31,38,39 In addition, FL#62 exhibited the highest C–H amination activity
in the presence of arylsulfonyl azides in our previous studies.7

P450 reactions with
substrates 1–4 were performed in
the presence of NADPH, to reduce the enzyme to
its ferrous state, and anaerobically, both of which conditions were
previously found to be critical for supporting P450-dependent nitrene
transfer reactivity.7 Gratifyingly, both
wild-type CYP102A1 and FL#62 were found to yield appreciable amounts
of the desired oxazolidinone 5 in the presence of the
acetoxy- and aryloxy-carbamates 1–3 (turnover number (TON): 4–7, Table 1). Importantly, significantly better conversion to the oxazolidinone
product could be achieved from the carbonazidate substrate 4 (Table 1) with FL#62 as the catalyst. In
contrast, little or no cyclic product was formed in the presence of
wild-type CYP102A1 or free hemin. Notably, no reaction was observed
in the presence of 4 under standard amination conditions
in the presence of Rh2(OAc)4, as noted previously,27 or Co-(TPP) (TPP = tetraphenylporphyrin), two
prominent organometallic catalysts investigated in the context of
C–H amination reactions.16,40

Toward optimization
of the reaction conditions, the importance
of the source of reducing equivalents in the P450-catalyzed conversion
of carbonazidate 4 was investigated. These experiments
showed that cyclization of 4 could be achieved by replacing
NADPH with the inexpensive dithionite (Na2S2O4), albeit only with lower efficiency (5 vs 20 TON).
This difference could be attributed to the kinetically competitive
reduction of the carbonazidate substrate to the corresponding carbamate
by action of the inorganic reductant as compared to the enzymatic
C–H amination reaction (0.2 turnovers/min). More promisingly,
comparable number of turnovers as observed in the presence of an excess
of NADPH (10 mM) could be obtained using catalytic amounts of NADPH
(100 μM) in combination with a phosphite dehydrogenase32 based cofactor regeneration system. Thus, under
optimized conditions, over 70 catalytic turnovers were achieved for
the FL#62-catalyzed transformation of 4 into 5 (Entry 1, Table 2). These improvements notwithstanding,
the yield of the C–H amination product remained moderate (∼4%),
with the remainder of the carbonazidate substrate being converted
to a carbamate and alcohol products as discussed in more details later.

Table 2 Scope of P450-Catalyzed C–H
Amination with Carbonazidate Substrates[a]
[a] Reactions conditions:
5 μM
P450, 10 mM carbonazidate, cofactor regeneration system (100 μM
NADP+, 1 μM phosphite dehydrogenase, 50 mM Na2PO3), 16 h. Turnover numbers (TON) were measured
by HPLC from triplicate experiments.

3.1 Investigation of Substrate Scope
To gain insights into the influence of electronic and steric effects
on the P450-catalyzed C–H amination reaction, a range of carbonazidates
(6–10) were then prepared and tested
for cyclization in the presence of FL#62. As shown in Table 2, various substitutions at the level of the aromatic
ring of the substrate were tolerated by the enzyme, resulting in turnover
numbers ranging from 10 to 100 (Entries 1–6, Table 2). Interestingly, an increase in TON was observed
upon substitution of the para position with a methyl
group (6; 100 vs 74 TON), whereas a reduction in C–H
amination activity resulted from substitution of this site with an
isosteric but electronwithdrawing trifluoromethyl group (7; 43 TON). This trend in reactivity is consistent with the electrophilic
character of the reactive species envisioned to mediate these reactions
(vide infra). Notably, derivatives with a bulky substituent (tert-butyl) at the para position (8) as well as double substitutions on the aromatic ring (10) were also processed by the enzyme.

With compounds 11–14, the influence of the relative strength
of the target C–H bond on the efficiency of the reaction was
investigated. Interestingly, FL#62-mediated amination of the secondary,
benzylic C–H bond in 11 as well as in the more
conformationally rigid 13 was found to occur with significantly
lower efficiency (10-fold) as compared to the tertiary, benzylic C–H
site in 4 (5–6 vs 74 turnovers). These results
suggest a clear dependence of the P450-dependent amination activity
on the C–H bond strength, a conclusion further supported by
the comparatively higher activity of the enzyme on 12 (15 TON), and lack of activity on 14, in which the
C–H bonds in β to the carbonazidate group have estimated
bond dissociation energies (BDE) of 86 and 98 kcal/mol, respectively.41 This bias notwithstanding, the catalytic turnovers
achieved by these P450 catalysts with carbonazidates compare very
favorably with those reported for rhodium or silver catalysts in the
context of oxalidinone synthesis from carbamate-iminoiodinane or N-tosyloxy-carbamate precursors (5–25 turnovers).25−27 Furthermore, the absence of aziridine formation in the reaction
with 12 supports the chemoselectivity of the P450 catalyst
toward nitrene C–H insertion over the potentially competing
aziridination reaction.27,42

Chiral analysis
of the oxazolidinone products generated from 4, 8, and 11 in the presence of
FL#62 showed only low levels of enantioinduction (2–5% ee).
These results were rather surprising as moderate to high degree of
stereo- or enantioselectivity (40–91% ee) were observed in
the cyclization of arylsulfonyl azides by means of FL#62 and related
CYP102A1 variants.7 Screening of a panel
of 15 FL#62-derived active site variants against carbonazidates 4, 8, and 11 gave similar results,
suggesting that the limited chiral induction observed with these substrates
is not dependent upon the active site configuration of the enzyme
but it is rather linked to the mechanism of the C–H activation
step operating in these processes as discussed further below.

3.2 Natural Product Substrates
To further
investigate the scope and potential utility of the P450 catalysts
in the context of oxazolidinone synthesis, carbonazidate derivatives
of two natural product terpenes, menthol (23) and borneol
(24), were subjected to FL#62 catalysis (Figure 1). Notably, both compounds could be converted to
a single five-membered cyclic product, namely, the trans-oxazolidinone 25 and the cis-oxazolidinone 26, respectively, with high regio- and stereoselectivity.
The high degree of site-selectivity obtained in the reactions with
these substrates contrasts with the unselective nitrene C–H
insertion events observed upon pyrolysis or photolysis of related
compounds.43,44

terpene natural products.
The graphs illustrates the relative activity, based on TON, for the
FL#62-derived active-site variants selected by fingerprint analysis
(SCA). The amino acid mutations in the P450 variants can be found
in Table S1. “s.r.c.” = standard
reaction conditions, as indicated in Table 2.

Despite the successful cyclization
of 23 and 24, we noted that the catalytic
efficiency of FL#62 on these
substrates was only modest (TON ∼ 4). Recently, we reported
a fingerprint-based method for predicting the substrate reactivity
of engineered P450s on target molecules that are structurally related
to the probe compounds used for their fingerprinting (referred to
as “fingerprint single component analysis” or SCA).38,39 Substrates 23 and 24 share significant
scaffold similarity with two of said fingerprint probes, namely, the
cyclohexane- and the bornane-based probes (Figure S1). Using SCA, four candidate P450 catalysts with potentially
improved activity for the cyclization of these substrates were identified
from our previously assembled collection of FL#62-based variants,
which were derived from this P450 via simultaneous mutagenesis of
2 to 6 active site positions.31,39 Gratifyingly, these
P450s were found capable of processing 23 and 24 supporting 3- to 5-fold higher catalytic turnovers than FL#62 (Figure 2). Altogether, these studies demonstrate the possibility
to apply these P450 catalysts for C–H amination transformations
in the context of structurally and stereochemically complex molecules.
Furthermore, these results support the functionality of our fingerprint-based
methods for P450 substrate reactivity prediction also in the context
of P450-mediated C–H aminations.

P450-catalyzed conversion of carbonazidates

byproduct is indicated in blue. Y = —OC(O)—.

3.3 Mechanistic Studies
Further experiments
were conducted to shed light into the mechanism of these reactions.
The requirement for a reductant (i.e., dithionite or NADPH) and complete
loss of carbonazidate C–H amination activity upon complexation
of the reduced P450 with CO provided clear evidence in support of
the involvement of the ferrous heme in catalysis. Accordingly and
building upon our investigations with arylsulfonyl azides7 and previous studies with metalloporphyrin systems,45−48 we envision the catalytic cycle to initiate with the binding of
the carbonazidate substrate to the ferrous heme to form an azido-iron(II)
complex, which would then undergo nitrogen loss to give a putative
imido-iron(IV) intermediate (Figure 2). Reasonably,
the subsequent C–H activation event could then proceed through
(a) a stepwise hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA)/radical rebound mechanism,
analogous to that mediated by oxo-iron(IV)porphyrin π cation
radical (Compound I) in P450-catalyzed C–H oxidations,49,50 or (b) a concerted nitrene C–H insertion, analogous to that
operating in rhodium-catalyzed C–H aminations.51 To probe this step, the cis isomer of
carbonazidate 12 ((Z)-12, Figure 3) was
subjected to FL#62-catalyzed amination conditions, with scrambling
of the double bond geometry upon cyclization being revealing of a
radical mechanism. Interestingly, only formation of the rearranged trans oxazolidinone (E)-21 was observed (TON: 16), a product identical
to that generated starting from (E)-12 (Figure 3). In
contrast, rhodium-catalyzed cyclization of carbamate (Z)-27 activated in situ
with PhI(OAc)2 yielded the cis oxazolidinone
product (Z)-21. Thus, these results unambiguously revealed that a stepwise mechanism,
involving HAA followed by radical recombination, is operative in the
P450 amination reaction (Figure 2). Furthermore,
the complete Z → E rearrangement of the olefinic
bond in (Z)-12 is suggestive of the formation of a relatively long-lived carbon-centered
radical, which could account for the observed lack of stereo/enantioselectivity
upon amination of the benzylic C–H sites in 4, 8, and 11 by FL#62 and its variants. On the other
hand, the high stereoselectivity observed in the case of the menthol
and borneol derivatives (Figure 1) could stem
from the faster rebound step expected to occur for the less stabilized
secondary alkyl radical intermediate formed during the intramolecular
C–H amination of these substrates.

Figure 3 Rearrangement studies.
(a) FL#62-catalyzed cyclization of (E)-12 (or its
isomer (Z)-12) leads to formation of trans oxazolidinone (E)-21, as determined
by HPLC (Figure S3 in SI)
and GC-MS analysis. The Z → E rearrangement in case of (Z)-12 is indicative of the formation radical intermediate
via HAA. (b) Rhodium-catalyzed cyclization of carbamate Z-27 is not accompanied by scrambling of the double bond configuration,
in agreement with the concerted nitrene C–H insertion mechanism
proposed for these catalysts.51

3.4 Kinetic Isotope Effect
(KIE) Experiments
According to the mechanistic model of Figure 2, cleavage of the C–H bond was expected to
be rate-limiting
during oxazolidinone formation. To examine this aspect, the effect
of H/D substitution on the C–H amination rate of substrate 6 was determined (Figure 4a). The positive
primary kinetic isotope effect observed in these experiments (kH/kD: 2.7 ±
0.3 at 20 °C) is consistent with the involvement of C–H
bond cleavage in the rate-determining step of the reaction. At the
same time, this value is considerably smaller than and comparable
to, respectively, that observed for C–H amination reactions
with Ru-porphyrins (kH/kD: 6–12)46,52 and rhodium catalysts
(kH/kD: 1.8–4.5),51,53 which were established to operate via a stepwise and concerted C–H
activation pathway, respectively. In light of the large KIE difference
compared to the Ru-porphyrin system, we wondered whether other steps
prior to C–H bond cleavage (e.g., activation of the azide via
N2 extrusion; Figure 2), may be also kinetically relevant in the P450 reaction, thus resulting
in partial “masking” of the actual KIE associated with
the C–H activation step. A powerful approach to examine this
aspect is through comparison of KIEintra versus KIEinter.54,55 Accordingly, the mono- (D1-11) and gem-dideuterated (D2-11) analogues of compound 11 (Figure 3b) were synthesized (see SI for
details) and utilized in intra- and intermolecular competition experiments,
respectively. Expectedly, a KIEintra > KIEinter would reveal that azide activation is also rate-limiting, whereas
KIEintra ≈ KIEinter would indicate that
C–H bond cleavage is the only rate-determining step in the
reaction. Analysis of the FL#62-catalyzed cyclization of D1-11 yielded a KIEintra = 4.7 ± 0.3, whereas the competition experiment with a 1:1
mixture of 11 and D2-11 yielded a KIEinter value of 5.3 ±
0.4 (Figure 3b), as determined by mass spectrometry
(Figure S5). The close similarity between
these values (within experimental error) thus supports a scenario
in which C–H bond cleavage is likely to be the predominant
rate-determining step in these P450-catalyzed C–H amination
reactions. At the same time, it is possible that in the presence of
weaker C–H bonds (e.g., tertiary vs secondary C–H bond
in 6 vs 11) other steps may become kinetically
important, thereby affecting the extent of the KIE associated with
the H/D substitution at the level of the aminated C–H bond.

3.5 Competing Pathways
Whereas the studies
above provided insights into the productive pathway leading to oxazolidinone
formation, evidence for the occurrence of competing, unproductive
pathways was also gathered. Indeed, in addition to the oxazolidinone
product, a considerable amount of the acyclic carbamate and of the
corresponding alcohol was observed in the P450 reactions with all
the substrates tested. Whereas the carbonazidate is completely consumed
in these reactions, the carbamate and alcohol products were found
to account for the majority of the consumed substrate (∼90%).
Nearly complete (>95%) suppression of either byproduct in the presence
of CO-saturated buffer proved that they are both generated at the
level of the heme center in the enzyme and not from reaction with
the flavins in the reductase domain or components of the cofactor
regeneration system. As proposed in the context of our previous studies
with arylsulfonyl azides, where a similar reduction byproduct (i.e.,
sulfonamide) was observed,7 we suspect
the acyclic carbamate to originate from overreduction and protonation
of the imido-iron intermediate (blue path, Figure 2), a process potentially favored by the native two single-electron/proton
transfer mechanism operating in P450s as required for the reductive
activation of O2 to Compound I.50 Interestingly, a similar “uncoupling” phenomenon was
observed during P450-catalyzed nitrene transfer to sulfides recently
investigated by Arnold and co-workers.23 Possible pathways leading to the alcohol byproduct could involve
hydrolysis of the heme bound carbonyl-nitrenoid species or radical
decarboxylation during catalysis. Although these uncoupling mechanisms
currently limit the synthetic utility of these P450-catalyzed transformations,
we anticipate that targeting structural elements mediating the native
electron/proton transfer pathway in these enzymes could provide a
future avenue to further increase their efficiency as C–H amination
catalysts.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have reported the successful synthesis of oxazolidinones
via the P450-catalyzed cyclization of carbonazidates. In addition
to expanding the reaction scope of cytochrome P450 enzymes, this report
describes the first example in which these atom-economical and readily
accessible nitrene donors are successfully employed in catalytic intramolecular
C–H amination reactions. Our structure–reactivity analyses
indicate that whereas benzylic/allylic C–H bonds with a BDE
< 90 kcal/mol are most readily aminated by these biocatalysts,
activation of stronger C–H bonds (i.e., nonbenzylic/nonallylic
2 °C–H) is also feasible. Our mechanistic and KIE analyses
indicate that the C–H activation step is rate-limiting and
proceeds in a stepwise manner (i.e., via HAA/radical rebound), reminiscent
of that involved in P450 hydroxylations. Overall, these studies provide
first-time insights into the mechanism of P450-mediated C–H
amination as well as a basis for further optimization of these catalysts.
The experiments with the terpene substrates demonstrate the feasibility
of applying these P450-based amination catalysts for the transformation
of complex natural products, with active site mutagenesis providing
a way to improve the catalytic activity toward a particular target
substrate. Because carbonazidates can be readily synthesized from
alcohols, the reactivity reported here could open exciting opportunities
for the application of these enzymes in synthesis, which may include,
for example, coupling selective P450 hydroxylation31,39,56 with P450-catalyzed carbonazidate cyclization
to install 1,2-aminoalcohol functionalities at remote C(sp3)—H positions in organic molecules.
