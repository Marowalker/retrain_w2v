The
majority of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) predominantly operate
as monooxygenases, but recently a class of P450 enzymes was discovered,
that can act as peroxygenases (CYP152). These enzymes convert fatty
acids through oxidative decarboxylation, yielding terminal alkenes,
and through α- and β-hydroxylation to yield hydroxy-fatty
acids. Bioderived olefins may serve as biofuels, and hence understanding
the mechanism and substrate scope of this class of enzymes is important.
In this work, we report on the substrate scope and catalytic promiscuity
of CYP OleTJE and two of its orthologues from the CYP152
family, utilizing α-monosubstituted branched carboxylic acids.
We identify α,β-desaturation as an unexpected dominant
pathway for CYP OleTJE with 2-methylbutyric acid. To rationalize
product distributions arising from α/β-hydroxylation,
oxidative decarboxylation, and desaturation depending on the substrate’s
structure and binding pattern, a computational study was performed
based on an active site complex of CYP OleTJE containing
the heme cofactor in the substrate binding pocket and 2-methylbutyric
acid as substrate. It is shown that substrate positioning determines
the accessibility of the oxidizing species (Compound I) to the substrate
and hence the regio- and chemoselectivity of the reaction. Furthermore,
the results show that, for 2-methylbutyric acid, α,β-desaturation
is favorable because of a rate-determining α-hydrogen atom abstraction,
which cannot proceed to decarboxylation. Moreover, substrate hydroxylation
is energetically impeded due to the tight shape and size of the substrate
binding pocket.

==== Body
Introduction
The heme-containing cytochrome P450 monooxygenases
(CYPs) demonstrate
broad substrate tolerance as they are vital for the metabolization
of xenobiotics and drug molecules,1 as
well as for the biosynthesis of hormones.2 Due to this substrate promiscuity and their regio- and stereospecificity,
they have become the topic of extensive research. CYP enzymes catalyze
aliphatic and aromatic C–H oxidations,3 epoxidations of olefins, sulfoxidations, dehalogenations, N- and O-dealkylations, desaturations,
and oxidative decarboxylations.4 More recently,
“non-natural” applications of CYPs have been enabled
through bioengineering their structure and function.5 Specifically, they have been utilized for the introduction
of nitrogen, boron, or silicon into organic frameworks6 or carbene- and nitrene-mediated reactions.7

The vast majority of CYP monooxygenases require one
molecule of
O2, two protons, and two electrons, which are transferred
one at a time from an external redox partner throughout the catalytic
cycle.1,8 A common issue of CYP monooxygenases is
the uncoupling reactions, leading to the loss of redox equivalents
in the form of hydrogen peroxide or superoxide anions which in turn
harm the enzyme. A handful of CYPs have evolved the ability to utilize
hydrogen peroxide as both electron- and oxygen-source instead, by
reversing the peroxide shunt that leads to uncoupling.9 These CYP-“peroxygenases” belong to the CYP152
subfamily, do not require a redox partner, and are able to hydroxylate
carboxylic acids. A well-studied peroxygenase from the CYP152 family
is the CYP OleTJE (CYP152L1) from Jeotgalicoccus
sp. ATCC 8456.10 This enzyme catalyzes
the oxidative decarboxylation of long-chain fatty acids yielding terminal
olefins alongside α- and β-hydroxylation (Scheme 1a).11 With hydrogen peroxide, the enzyme works as peroxygenase; however,
it was also shown to efficiently work as monooxygenase.10c Recent results demonstrated that, in this case,
OleTJE utilizes electrons derived from a redox system which
are then lost by uncoupling and re-enter the catalytic cycle as hydrogen
peroxide. Therefore, Compound I can only be formed with hydrogen peroxide,
and the enzyme predominantly acts as peroxygenase.9e Since selective oxidative decarboxylation opens access
to bioderived olefins from carboxylic acids, understanding the mechanism
and product formation of these enzymes is an important basis for the
development of more efficient and selective enzyme variants.

Products and Their Stereoisomers: 1b–5b from Oxidative Decarboxylation, 1c–5c from α–Hydroxylation, and 1d–5d from β-Hydroxylation
Most studies on the reaction profile of CYP152 enzymes
in general,
but OleTJE especially, focused on identifying main product
distributions rather than a careful calibration with authentic references
and quantification of all products.9g,10a,10c,12 On top of that, information
regarding stereochemical preferences of OleTJE catalysis
remains scarce.13 Overall, the enzyme’s
broad reactivity produces not only enantiomeric α- or β-hydroxy
acids, but also regioisomeric alkenes. For instance, in the reaction
of rac-2a, 13 different compounds must
be considered (Scheme 1b).

Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) studies,
focused
on product distributions in CYP OleTJE for oxidative decarboxylation
versus α- and β-hydroxylation, showed14 and stopped-flow experiments confirmed10,11 that all products originate from a rate-determining hydrogen atom
abstraction of either Cα or Cβ.

To address major
questions related to the structure, function,
and substrate scope of CYP152 peroxygenases we decided to perform
a combined experimental and computational study into these systems:
The primary oxidation-product distribution for a structurally diverse
set of carboxylic acids 1a–5a bearing
a stereocenter at Cα (Scheme 1a), using peroxygenases OleTJE, CYPCla from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CYP152A2),15 and CYPBSβ from Bacillus
subtilis (CYP152A1),16 was evaluated
and revealed an unprecedented α,β-desaturation activity.
The origin of the different reactivities was rationalized by computational
methods based on an active site complex of CYP OleTJE.

Methods
General
procedure for Biotransformations with OleT–CamAB–FDH
reaction cascade
Biotransformations of substrates using OleTJE were performed as previously described.10c A typical reaction mixture contained purified OleTJE (6 μM), putidaredoxin CamAB (0.05 U mL–1), catalase (500 U mL–1), substrate (10 mM), ethanol
(5% v/v), potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 100 mM), nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or NAD+ (200 μM), formate
dehydrogenase (FDH; 2 U mL–1), and ammonium formate
(100 mM). All reactions were performed at atmospheric pressure at
room temperature (or 4 °C) in a 1 mL volume in a 4 mL glass vial
closed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) septum with shaking at
170 rpm for 24 h. The activity of the CamAB system and the concentration
of active, purified OleTJE were determined prior to each
biotransformation using a cytochrome c-based activity assay and CO-titration,
respectively (Supporting Information).
Biotransformations as well as negative control experiments (without
OleTJE) were performed in triplicate for each substrate
and were stopped by freezing the samples at −20 °C.

Biotransformations with CYPCla and CYPBSβ
Biotransformations using CYPCla and CYPBSβ were done in 4 mL glass vials sealed with a PTFE
septum with shaking at 170 rpm for 24 h at room temperature. The reaction
mixture contained purified enzyme (6 μM), substrate (10 mM),
and ethanol (5% v/v). H2O2 was used as the sole
oxidant, and supply was provided using a syringe pump (kdScientific).
A flow of 1.6 mM H2O2 h–1 (5
μL h–1 from a 320 μM stock solution)
was set, and 16 mM (50 μL) was added in total. Biotransformations
and negative control experiments (without enzyme) were performed in
triplicate for each substrate and were stopped by freezing the samples
at −20 °C.

Computation
Calculations were performed
using previously
described and calibrated methods.17 Density
functional theory (DFT) was applied using the unrestricted B3LYP hybrid
density functional theory18 for geometry
optimizations and frequencies in the gas phase. The mechanism for
the activation of (R)- and (S)-2-methylbutyric
acid (2a) by CYP Compound I (CpdI) was studied. The initial
calculations used a simplified model (A) containing an
iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin radical cation model for CpdI, whereby the
axial cysteinate residue was abbreviated with thiolate, and all porphyrin
substituents were replaced by hydrogen atoms: [FeIV(O)(Por+•)(SH)]. The general reactivity landscape and electronic
structure of intermediates and transition states with the (S)-enantiomer of the substrate, leading to either hydroxylation,
desaturation, or decarboxylation products, were calculated. In all
calculations for model A, the geometry optimizations
were done with a 6-31G* basis set19 on
all atoms, except on iron where LANL2DZ with effective core potential
(ECP) was used (basis set BS1).20 To improve
the energies a single point with a larger basis set, i.e., 6-311+G*
on all atoms, was performed (basis set BS2). Calculations were run
in the Gaussian 09 software package21 and
were done on the lowest-energy doublet and quartet spin states.

In a second set of calculations a comprehensive cluster model was
investigated (model B), based on a detailed analysis
of the protein structure and dynamics. In particular, with molecular
dynamics simulations the protein and especially the substrate binding
pocket flexibility was investigated. However, these studies (Supporting
Information, Figures S1 and S2) showed
little flexibility in substrate positioning and dynamics. Therefore,
we decided to use an expanded cluster model rather than QM/MM for
detailed studies on the mechanism of substrate activation. These cluster
models have been shown to give an accurate representation of enzyme
active site activities and reproduce experimental chemo- and regioselectivity
patterns.22 Thus, the small model was expanded
with residues representing the substrate binding pocket (Figure S4) until structure convergence was achieved
using procedures as described by Liao et al. (see also Figure S10).23 The
energies and structures of the two models were comparable, and hence
the calculations were continued with model A. The (S)- and (R)-enantiomers of the substrate were docked into the 4L40 protein databank
(pdb) file11a with the SwissDock web service.24 The 4L40 pdb file is a substrate bound resting state structure,
but we removed the original substrate and tested various alternative
stable substrate binding positions. A total of three distinct low-energy
(R)-isomers and five (S)-isomers
were selected as the starting points of the calculations. Based on
these structures and the results from the MD simulations, a model
was created that contained the iron(IV)-oxo porphyrin cation radical
with thiolate axial ligand and substrate (as in model A above) and the side chains of residues located close to the substrate
in the active site (Leu78, Phe79, Ile170, Pro246, Ala249, Phe291, and Val292; Scheme 2 and Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The total model included 163 atoms, and constraints were placed on
protein backbone atoms to keep the features of the substrate binding
pocket; these atoms are highlighted with an asterisk in Scheme 2. A trimmed proline residue
was protonated to account for the lost backbone carbon bond. The system
was overall charge neutral and was calculated in the lowest doublet
and quartet spin states.

Scheme 2 Active Site Cluster Model of CYP OleTJE with Substrate
Bound
Atoms highlighted with an
asterisk were fixed during the geometry optimization.

The studies on model B use the unrestricted
B3LYP-GD318,25 density functional method in combination
with the def2-SVP26 basis set on all atoms
(basis set BS3). An enlarged
basis set (BS4) that incorporates def2-TZVP on all atoms and an implicit
solvent model, i.e., the polarized continuum model with water as dielectric
constant, was employed to correct the energies for all results for
model B. Free energies reported here use entropic and
thermal (at 298 K) corrections.

Transition states were located
by initially running constraint
geometry scans between reactants and intermediates (or in between
intermediates and products) and vice versa, whereby one degree of
freedom was fixed (the reaction coordinate), while all other degrees
of freedom were allowed to relax. The maxima of these geometry scans
were subjected to a full transition state search in Gaussian using
default settings.

Results and Discussion
Identification of Desaturation
Activity of OleTJE
The biotransformation of myristic
acid (1a), 2-methylbutyric acid (2a), and
2-phenylbutyric acid
(3a) by CYP was studied. Even though OleTJE was recently demonstrated to be a true peroxygenase,9e the established OleTJE–CamAB–FDH
reaction system10c,27 proved to be very productive
in biotransformations and was applied herein. Figure 1 gives the individual product distributions
for the reactions of rac-1a, rac-2a, and rac-3a in OleTJE.

and Sankey representation of the product distribution. The width of
the lines corresponds to the relative amount of substrate that was
converted (left-hand side) and the relative amount of product that
was formed (right-hand side).

With substrate 1a, OleTJE yielded
a mixture
of alkene (1b) and 3-hydroxymyristic acid (1d) as sole products with an overall conversion of 11% matching previous
reports.10c However, as the product distribution
highly depended on the reaction conditions, alternative redox partners
were reported to cause also α-hydroxylation,11a,13,28 which was not observed here. By contrast,
CYP OleTJE converted 3a through decarboxylation
to form 3b and α-hydroxylation to generate 3c, again, matching previous reports with this substrate.13 Remarkably, strict (R)-hydroxylation
of 1a and 3a was observed leading to (R)-1c and (R)-3d with high ee, while a slight (S)-preference prevailed
for the α-chiral substrate 3a (Table 1).

a Error-margins can be found in the Supporting Information. Reactions were performed
in triplicate with 10 mM substrate for 24 h at either room temperature
(rt) or 4 °C.

b Secondary
oxidation products (e.g.,
keto acids) were not measured and contribute to the incomplete recovery.

c No terminal products (alkenes
or
hydroxylation products) were detected.

d Chiral center is not formed by hydroxylation
but is already present in the substrate; traces = only traces of product
were detected in headspace gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy
(GC-MS; not quantified).

For the small 2-methylbutyric acid (2a) the (S)-form was preferred, and α-hydroxylation produced
(R)-2c29 in
moderate enantioselectivity. This fits to the trend that CYP450s tend
to activate the weakest C–H bond of a substrate,30 which in this case is Cα. Interestingly,
besides the formation of minor amounts of decarboxylation product
(2b) and α-hydroxylation, OleTJE also
led to desaturation of 2a leading to (E/Z)-2,3-dimethylacrylic acid (E/Z-2e), which is the first time that
fatty acid desaturation has been observed in CYP152 reactions (Figure 1).

CYP450 desaturations
have been observed in rare cases by enzymes
from other CYP classes, such as the desaturation of valproic acid
demonstrated by Rettie et al. in 1987, or desaturations of ethyl carbamate,
sterols, and alkylbenzenes and the terminal desaturation of lauric
acid.31 Density functional theory studies
on the regioselective hydroxylation versus desaturation of valproic
acid and ethyl carbamate showed a spin-selective reaction mechanism
with dominant hydroxylation on the high-spin surface and a mixture
of products on the low-spin state.32 Desaturation
reactivity was also already suggested for the CYP152 family member
OleTJE. However, a combination of overoxidation to the
ketone, followed by enolization during the derivatization step, was
likely its origin rather than enzyme catalyzed desaturation.28 Herein, nonenzymatic pathways, such as spontaneous
desaturation, dehydration of a hydroxylated metabolite, as well as
enzymatic secondary activities of OleTJE and CYPBsβ on hydroxylated products (e.g., 2c or 2d), were excluded with a series of control experiments (Supporting Information).

Reactivity of OleTJE, CYPCla, or CYPBSβ
Despite the close structural homology of
substrates 2a and 3a, no desaturation products
could be detected for the latter. To understand the reactivity differences
of OleTJE with 2a and 3a, the
further substrates 2-phenylbutanoic acid (4a) and 2-phenylpropanoic
acid (5a) were included in the study, and the product
distributions for all substrates were investigated with OleTJE (at both room temperature and 4 °C) and the additional CYP152
orthologues CYPCla and CYPBSβ. While again
the OleTJE–CamAB–FDH reaction system was
used for the OleTJE-transformations, CYPCla and
CYPBSβ studies were performed using H2O2 as the oxidant. All metabolites were carefully quantified,
and stereoselectivities and absolute configurations were measured
for the products and the substrate (Table 1).

The transformation of all substrates
by CYPCla yielded α-hydroxylation products exclusively,
whereas OleTJE and CYPBSβ generated a
mixture of products. Oxidative decarboxylation was observed for the
reactions of OleTJE with 1a and 3a and for CYPBsβ with 1a. Moreover,
α,β-desaturation was found for OleTJE with 2a, 4a, and 5a, as well as for CYPBsβ with 4a and 5b. As such,
OleTJE and CYPBSβ give analogous reactivity
patterns and product distributions, but yields and turnovers vary.
In the majority of studies on OleTJE, only linear fatty
acids or diacids were investigated as substrates,10,11,13,28,33 which do not react through desaturation, and hence
this activity has never been reported before.

The overall substrate
conversion as a function of isozyme is divergent.
In the case of OleTJE, the highest conversion and turnover
number (TON) was obtained for substrate 5a (44%, 733
TON). The reaction temperature had a slight impact on the overall
reactivity (e.g., 36% conversion, 595 TON, based on the sum of recovered
products). By contrast, with CYPCla and CYPBSβ the highest conversion was with 3a instead. It needs
to be mentioned that secondary oxidation products (e.g., keto acids)
were not measured and contribute to the incomplete recoveries that
were found.

With OleTJE, an almost 2:1 mixture of
desaturation product
over α-hydroxy acid was obtained with substrates 2a and 5a. Interestingly this ratio is reversed for 4a (1:4), which may be caused by an altered orientation of
the substrate in the active site, forced by the additional methyl
group of 4a, leading to a favored rebound over desaturation.
This steric demand may also be the reason for the decreased turnovers
for substrate 4a compared to substrate 5a.

Interestingly, all substrates that show desaturation only
gave
byproducts from α-hydroxylation. Thus, for 2a, 4a, and 5a the α-hydroxylated product is
a tertiary alcohol, and for 4a and 5a a
benzylic alcohol. These products originate from the breaking of the
weakest C–H bond in the molecule, which yields a stable radical.
This implies that, for the α-hydroxylation and desaturation
of the substrate, Cα–H abstraction is the common initial
step in the mechanism. Interestingly, also CYPCla activates
the α-position of all substrates but solely gives α-hydroxylation
as products. Therefore, the desaturase activity by OleTJE and CYPBsβ might originate from an unfavorable
oxygen-rebound step due to differences in substrate binding pockets
(vide infra). Note that, in none of the cases studied,
terminal side-chain hydroxylation, i.e., the formation of term-2d or term-4d (Scheme 1), occurred.

Enantioselectivity of OleTJE, CYPCla,
or CYPBSβ
All tested CYP isozymes exhibit
a slight stereochemical preference for the (R)-enantiomer
of α-chiral substrates 2a–5a. Due to the large number of possible reaction pathways, the enantiomeric
ratios (E-values) could not be calculated in most
cases. As CYPCla did produce only one product, the system
can be described using enantiomeric ratios: low E-values (<10) were calculated for substrates 2a–5a, based on the conversion and the substrates ee values.
As the reaction of CYPBSβ with substrate 5a yields only one product (5d), and the substrate stereocenter
is not altered throughout the reaction, this is the only other reaction
that can be described with an enantiomeric ratio. A value of 30 was
obtained. For the other reactions, high substrate conversion paired
with high ee values (up to 99%) suggests moderate E-values. Substrate 2a, bearing the smallest substituents
and therefore the least possible interactions for chiral recognition,
gave the lowest ee values. A high stereoselectivity for the (R)-enantiomer (ee values of up to 99%) was obtained from
β-hydroxylation of substrates 1a (by OleTJE and CYPBSβ) and 5a (by CYPBSβ), which matches previous observations with CYPBSβ.16c Similarly, α-hydroxylation
of 4a by all enzymes produced (R)-4c with stereoselectivities of >95%. Interestingly, this
result
contrasts the reported selectivity of the CYP152 family member CYPSPα.34 The slightly less bulky
substrates 2a, 3a, and 5a were
found to be α-hydroxylated by all CYP isozymes with moderate
to good ee values. Especially in the case of α-hydroxylation,
the stereogenic center is destroyed throughout the reaction mechanism,
and the selectivity of the rebound determines the stereochemical outcome.
Interestingly, low ee values, paired with high conversion (e.g., CYPCla and 3a), suggest that the rebound can occur
from both faces of the planar α-radical intermediate. It is
worth mentioning that chiral tertiary alcohol moieties in the α-position
of carboxylic acids represent attractive synthons, which are difficult
to generate by conventional means.

Isotope Labeling Studies
Overall, the observed selectivity
of substrate activation by the CYP isozymes OleTJE, CYPCla, and CYPBSβ is clearly dependent on the
shape and size of the substrate and its positioning in the binding
pocket. Most likely all reactions are initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction
from either Cα or Cβ of the substrate. To determine the
location of initial Cα–H abstraction for desaturation,
regiospecifically deuterated derivatives [2-2H]-2a and [3,3-2H2]-2a of 2-methylbutyric
acid (2a) were synthesized and used as substrate probes
for the OleTJE/CamAB-FDH system (see the SI).

As expected, the introduction of the deuterium
in the α- and β-position had severe effects on the outcome
of product formation (Table 2). The decarboxylation reactivity was significantly reduced
when the β,β-dideuterated substrate [3,3-2H2]-2a was applied, whereas it was slightly promoted
with [2-2H]-2a. Similar isotope effects are
found for the aromatic [2-2H]-4a (see Table S28, Supporting Information). This suggests
Cβ–H-abstraction as the rate-limiting step for the decarboxylation.
On the contrary, desaturation reactivity radically diminished with
the α-deuterated [2-2H]-2a, and to a
smaller extent, also for [3,3-2H2]-2a. Similarly, α-hydroxylation was reduced with the α-deuterated
compound, whereas β-deuteration had only marginal effects on
this reactivity. This leads to the conclusion that, for desaturation
and α-hydroxylation, the rate-limiting hydrogen abstraction
takes place at Cα, while Cβ has no impact in the α-hydroxylation
and plays only a minor role in desaturation (being the second H that
is abstracted). Even though regioselective deuteration is known to
potentially alter the reaction center, no switch in regioselectivity
toward β-hydroxylation was detectable. Potential additional
hydride transfer steps could be ruled out by analysis of MS-fragmentation
patterns.35

Computation
To gain insight into
the origin of the
enantio- and regioselectivity of substrate activation by CYP OleTJE isozymes, a density functional theory study on the mechanisms
leading to desaturation, α- and β-hydroxylation and decarboxylation
of (R)- and (S)-2-methylbutyrate
(2a) by the active iron(IV)-oxo heme cation radical species
CYP Compound I (CpdI), was done.1,4,36 This system was studied extensively with computational methods and
found to have close-lying doublet and quartet spin states.37 CpdI was characterized with spectroscopic methods
for CYP119, including electron paramagnetic resonance studies and
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy.36

Two different active site models of CpdI
with substrate (models A and B) were created,
and the substrate activation according to the mechanisms in Figure 2 was studied. Focus
was set on the large model (model B) as it contains the
full shape of the substrate binding pocket and hence mimics the real
protein better. In general, the absence of the substrate binding pocket
residues leads to the lowering of reaction barriers and gives a preference
of abstracting the weakest C–H bond. Details of the small model
calculations are given in the SI. The reactions
start from a reactant complex (RC) of CpdI with the substrate
via an initial hydrogen atom abstraction from either Cα–H
or Cβ–H via transition states TSHA,α and TSHA,β, respectively. Both systems
relax to a radical intermediate consisting of an iron(IV)hydroxo-heme
and a nearby radical (IR1α and IR1β; IR, intermediate representation). Past
these radical intermediates the mechanisms bifurcate, and from IR1α the possibilities are α-oxygen-rebound
via TShydrox,α to form α-hydroxylated
product (Prhydrox,α) or alternatively
hydrogen atom abstraction from Cβ via transition state TSdesat,α to give desaturation products (Prdesat). The mechanisms from IR1β lead to three possible products, namely, desaturation
products (Prdesat) via a second hydrogen atom
abstraction via transition state TSdesat,β, radical rebound to form β-hydroxylated products (Prhydrox,β) via transition state TShydrox,β, and finally decarboxylation via TSdecarb,β to give olefin, CO2, and an
iron(III)-hydroxy-heme product (Prdecarb).

nomenclature. Protein residues of model B not shown.

The substrate enantiomers, i.e.,
(R)- and (S)-2-methylbutyrate [(R)-2a and (S)-2a], were docked into the
crystal structure coordinates, and several low-energy conformations
were found (Figures S5 and S6, see the
SI for details). The geometries of the RC were optimized
with DFT methods in the doublet and quartet spin states for three
substrate (R)-conformers (R1, R4, and R7) and five
(S)-conformers (S1, S2, S3, S5, and S6).

Subsequently,
the hydrogen atom abstraction from the Cα–H
and Cβ–H positions of the substrate was calculated for
all eight RC configurations including (R)- and (S)-enantiomers in the doublet and quartet
spin states. Although a possible total of 32 transition states were
searched, a large number of those were high in energy and inaccessible
due to the position of the substrate in the binding pocket. Particularly,
the salt bridge between the substrates’ carboxylate and Arg245 residue gives considerable restraints to substrate rotation
and makes some C–H groups inaccessible for the oxidant. Figure 3 gives the full set
of hydrogen atom abstraction transition states located for all substrate
binding positions of the (R)-enantiomer of 2-methylbutyrate
(2a). For substrate binding in position R1, only β-hydrogen
atom abstraction is found with activation energies of ΔE + ZPE⧧ = 17.6 (quartet) and
18.0 (doublet) kcal mol–1. On the other hand, binding
orientation R4 only gives accessible Cα–H hydrogen atom
abstraction with barriers of 13.9 (quartet) and 14.5 (doublet) kcal
mol–1. Thus, even though the R4 reactant complexes
are higher in energy by 2 kcal mol–1, their hydrogen
atom abstraction barriers are lower. Structurally, hydrogen atom abstraction
transition states 4,2TSHA,α,R4 and 4,2TSHA,β,R1 are alike
with short C–H and long O–H distances in the low-spin
and the hydrogen atom almost midway in between the donor and acceptor
atoms in the high-spin. After the transition states, the complexes
relax to a radical intermediate with configuration [FeIV(OH)(heme)SH]–Sub• through electron transfer
from the substrate into the heme a2u orbital for both doublet
and quartet spin states. Reaching the radical intermediates (4,2IR1α,R4 and 4,2IR1β,R1) is an almost thermoneutral
process with values of −6.6/–6.6 and 1.2/1.1 kcal mol–1, respectively.

Inaccessible (high-energy) pathways are identified with dashes (−).

The substrate binding orientation
R7 is weaker than R1 and R4 as
only one oxygen atom of the carboxylate is involved in the salt bridge
with Arg245. However, this gives the substrate more flexibility,
and now both pathways for Cα–H and Cβ–H
hydrogen atom abstraction are accessible. All hydrogen atom abstraction
transition states in the R7 conformation are high in energy, and the
lowest one (2TSHA,α,R7) has
an activation energy of 19.6 kcal mol–1. The hydrogen
atom abstraction barriers in R7 stay high in energy compared to those
found for R1.

All hydrogen atom abstraction pathways for the
(S)-enantiomer [(S)-2a] of the substrate
(Figure 4) were calculated.
Although five substrate binding positions were identified, in only
three of those viable hydrogen atom abstraction barriers were found.
The lowest-energy hydrogen atom abstraction for (S)-2a by OleTJE CpdI is from the β-position
in conformation S1 in the doublet spin state (2TSHA,β,S1) that gives an activation energy of only
10.3 kcal mol–1. This barrier is 3.6 kcal mol–1 lower in energy than the lowest hydrogen atom abstraction
barrier for the (R)-enantiomer and would imply faster
conversion of (S)-2a as compared to
(R)-2a by OleTJE, which is
experimentally confirmed.

Within 4 kcal mol–1 of 2TSHA,β,S1 there are four more hydrogen atom
abstraction
barriers, namely, 4TSHA,β,S2 (ΔE + ZPE⧧ =
11.9 kcal mol–1), 2TSHA,α,S1 (ΔE + ZPE⧧ = 13.8 kcal mol–1), 2TSHA,β,S2 (ΔE + ZPE⧧ = 13.9 kcal mol–1), and 4TSHA,β,S1 (ΔE + ZPE⧧ = 14.3 kcal mol–1). Another three transition states are within 6 kcal mol–1 of 4TSHA,β,S2, see Figures 3 and 4.

In summary, (R)-2-methylbutyrate
[(R)-2a] was found to bind preferentially
in position R1,
but the lowest-energy HAT pathway is for Cα–H abstraction
in position R4; as such products resulting from Cα–H
abstraction should be dominant. The (S)-isomer, by
contrast, has close-lying S1 and S2 substrate binding positions that
could give Cα–H and Cβ–H hydrogen atom abstraction
pathways with lower barriers than those seen for the (R)-isomer. As such, theory predicts faster reactivity of (S)-2a over (R)-2a in agreement with the experimental turnover numbers (Table 1) that give preferential (S)-2a reactivity over (R)-2a. The computational work compares well with experiment and
highlights the effect of substrate positioning and the shape and size
of the substrate binding pocket on the regio- and chemoselectivity
as also highlighted by the experimental results shown in Table 1. Technically, Cα–H
hydrogen atom abstraction can lead to desaturation and α-hydroxylation
products, whereas Cβ–H hydrogen atom abstraction can
give β-hydroxylation, desaturation, and decarboxylation products.
Although we did not test these pathways for all our isomeric structures
and substrate binding positions, as an example we tested all five
pathways for one specific isomer, namely, for (S)-2a bound in the S1 conformation as this structure gives accessible
Cα–H and Cβ–H hydrogen atom abstraction
pathways.

For the substrate bound in the S1-position, the full
reaction mechanism
leading to products was located. Thus, after hydrogen atom abstraction
the complexes relax to an intermediate with a radical on Cα
(with energies relative to 4,2RCS1 of −7.4 and −7.5 kcal mol–1 in the
quartet and doublet spin state) or on Cβ (ΔE + ZPE = −0.9 and −1.1 kcal mol–1 in the quartet and doublet spin state). These relative energies
correspond to the relative stability of a tertiary versus secondary
carbon radical and favor hydrogen atom abstraction from Cα–H.
The size and shape of the substrate binding pocket and oxidant and
the rigidity of substrate binding thanks to the Arg245 salt
bridge means that Cα–H reactivity is not necessarily
the most dominant pathway as seen from the relative energies of the
transition states in Figure 4. Subsequent reaction of the Cα-radical intermediate
(4,2IRα,S1) leads to desaturation
with a barrier of 2.8 (0.5) kcal mol–1 in the quartet
(doublet) spin states, whereas the OH-rebound has a barrier of 3.2
kcal mol–1 (quartet spin state). By contrast, after
the initial β-hydrogen atom abstraction, we calculated pathways
for desaturation (2.8 kcal mol–1 on the quartet
spin state), β-hydroxylation (3.0 kcal mol–1 on the doublet spin state), and decarboxylation (20.1 kcal mol–1 on the quartet spin state). Therefore, decarboxylation
will be an inaccessible process here, and after β-hydrogen atom
abstraction the only products expected will be for desaturation and
β-hydroxylation. Previously, QM/MM calculations for arachidonic
acid (C20) activation by CYP OleTJE gave decarboxylation
barriers of <0.5 kcal mol–1 on the doublet spin
state and 6.7–8.4 kcal mol–1 on the quartet
spin state.14 Although the previous study
uses different computational methods and techniques, the overall trends
show that replacing arachidonic acid by methylbutyrate (2a) raises the decarboxylation barriers significantly as a lesser stable
product is formed. This is in agreement with the data shown in Table 1, where for a long-chain
fatty acid, as substrate 1a, decarboxylation is the dominant
product, whereas for 2a desaturation is observed.

The calculations for the full mechanism for the conversion of reactants
bound in conformation S1 to products predict dominant desaturation
pathways for (S)-2a by CYP OleTJE via either 4,2IRα,S1 or 4,2IRβ,S1 pathways.
In addition, the reaction channel that passes the 4,2IRα,S1 intermediate also gives α-hydroxylation
products, whereas β-hydroxylation is accessible for 2IRβ,S1. Therefore, the computational
studies are in excellent agreement with the product distributions
reported above in Figure 1.

Rationalization of the Product Distributions
As shown
in this work, product-types and distributions of the reaction of CYP
OleTJE with substrates are highly dependent on the type
of substrate chosen: Linear fatty acids, such as myristic acid (1a), are converted by CYP OleTJE to terminal olefins
and β-hydroxylation products. By contrast, 2-phenylbutyric acid
(3a) also gives decarboxylation to form a terminal olefin,
but as side product α-hydroxylation (rather than β-hydroxylation)
is seen. Finally, 2-methylbutyric acid (2a) reacts via
desaturation (rather than decarboxylation) alongside α-hydroxylation
pathways. The diverse substrate activation by CYP OleTJE is rationalized as follows.

As shown in the past, the reaction
rate for hydrogen atom abstraction reactions often correlates with
the bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the C–H bond that is
broken during the reaction.4c,29,38 Thus, for a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reaction between CpdI or
[FeIV(O)(heme+•)Cys], and a substrate
(Sub–H), the general equation for HAT as shown in eq 1 can be formulated. The driving
force for that reaction is dependent on the difference in energy of
the BDECH of the substrate and the BDEOH of
the iron(IV)-hydroxo complex, eq 2.39 1   2  

The bond dissociation energies of
the Cα–H and Cβ–H
bonds of 2-methylbutyric acid (2a) are defined as BDECα–H and BDECβ–H. Their
values were calculated at UB3LYP/6-31G* level of theory with dispersion,
solvent, and zero-point corrections and give BDECα–H = 83.5 and BDECβ–H = 94.1 kcal mol–1, respectively. Therefore, α-HAT should be significantly preferred
over β-HAT in a reaction of CYP Compound I with 2a under ideal circumstances, i.e., without substrate perturbations
by the protein pocket. Together with the BDEOH of the iron(IV)-hydroxo
complex of 90.8 kcal mol–1 α-HAT and β-HAT
are (based on eq 2) ΔE = −7.3 and +3.3 kcal mol–1. These
values match the energies to reach the radical intermediates excellently,
e.g., compare with Supporting Information, Table S15.

Figure 5 gives the
orbital and electron distributions during the hydrogen atom abstraction
step. Thus, CpdI has a biradical along the Fe–O bond due to
orbital occupation of the antibonding π*xz and π*yz orbitals with one
electron. In addition, there is a heme radical (in a2u)
to give a ferromagnetic quartet or antiferromagnetic doublet spin
state.4b,37,40 Upon hydrogen
atom abstraction from either Cα–H or Cβ–H
these bonds break, and a radical remains on the substrate rest-group
designated ϕRα and ϕRβ. The hydrogen atom forms a bond with the oxo group (σOH), and as a result, the πxz/π*xz pair of orbitals breaks and
moves one electron into a2u.

Figure 5 VB depiction of hydrogen
atom abstraction from the α- or
β-position of 2-methylbutyric acid (2a) with orbital
changes highlighted and HAT driving forces in kcal mol–1 (also given for 1a and 3a). Dots represent
valence electrons, and a line in between two dots represents a bonding
orbital occupied by two electrons.

To understand the relative barriers, valence bond (VB) modeling
was used to predict the hydrogen atom abstraction barriers from empirical
relationships as described and explained previously.41 In particular, a model was devised, based on the vertical
energy (Gexc) difference between the reactant
and product configuration in the geometry of the reactants plus a
component for the driving force (ΔErp) from reactants to products as described by eq 3 and were derived previously.41c Previously, these electronic structure analyses
were used to rationalize regioselectivities and substrate activation
trends by various iron(IV)-oxo intermediates. To explore whether here
also electronic factors contribute to rebound versus desaturation
versus decarboxylation processes, we used these VB models to explore
the regioselectivities. The reorganization energy B is included for the change in structure during the reaction coordinate
and is taken as half the value of the weakest of the bonds that are
either broken or formed. 3  

For the hydrogen atom transfer, the driving force is simply
the
difference in energy between the BDECH and BDEOH as described by eq 2 above. The value of Gexc contains contributions
for bond breaking and electron transfer processes that happen in the
reaction step. Thus, as shown by the VB structures in Figure 5 during the hydrogen atom abstraction
step, one C–H bond from the substrate is broken (BDECα–H or BDECβ–H), but on top of that also the
πxz/π*xz three-electron bond reverts to atomic orbitals. The contribution
from this was estimated previously as 136.0 kcal mol–1.42 As such eq 3 predicts a hydrogen atom abstraction barrier
from the Cα–H and Cβ–H positions of 2a of 7.6 and 14.6 kcal mol–1 (Figure 5). These values are
in good quantitative agreement with the small model complex calculations.
However, the addition of the substrate binding pocket (Figures 3 and 4) raises these values significantly and particularly makes these
two pathways competitive. These barriers were also predicted for myristic
acid (1a) and 2-phenylbutyric acid (3a).

In all three substrates, the hydrogen atom abstraction barrier
from Cβ–H is similar (Figure 5), but dramatically different on Cα.
The BDECα–H of 3a is very small
(79.3 kcal mol–1) and consequently well-separated
from that of Cβ–H. The VB modeling, therefore, predicts
dominant products originating from Cα–H hydrogen atom
abstraction for substrate 3a, which is observed experimentally
(Figure 1). For substrate 1a the smallest hydrogen atom abstraction difference between
Cα–H and Cβ–H is found from VB modeling.
Indeed, this substrate gives mostly reaction products originating
from Cβ–H abstraction by CpdI (Figure 1).

Subsequently, the pathways from
the radical intermediates (4,2IR1α and 4,2IR1β) were analyzed,
leading to α-
and β-hydroxylation, desaturation, and decarboxylation, which
are described through the VB analysis in Figure 6.

Figure 6 VB mechanism for reaction pathways leading to
desaturation, hydroxylation,
and decarboxylation from radical intermediates during the reaction
of CpdI with 2a.

From the intermediates 4,2IR1α the OH-rebound pathway gives 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutyric
acid (2c) by forming a σCO bond between
the radical
and OH groups. At the same time the πyz/π*yz three-electron bond
reverts to atomic orbitals, whereby one electron moves into the σCO orbital, and the other two remain on iron. A similar mechanism
is found for the desaturation pathway from 4,2IR1β. Therefore, the desaturation energy (Edesat,α) from 4,2IR1α contains contributions for the breaking of the σCH orbital of Cβ—H (BDErad,β),
the energy to break the πyz/π*yz orbitals (Eπ/π*yz), and the forming of the π-bond of the olefin (EπR). These contributions were estimated from small
model complexes, and a desaturation barrier from 4,2IRα of 1.6 kcal mol–1 was
predicted, whereas it is 3.1 kcal mol–1 from 4,2IRβ. These values are in good
agreement with the DFT results presented above. For the radical rebound
process, the iron(IV)-hydroxo changes to an iron(III)(heme) weakly
coordinating to an alcohol or water molecule. This means that again
the πyz/π*yz orbitals break along the Fe—O bond. On top of that,
the radical undergoes major structural changes as the radical center
changes from sp2 to sp3 hybridization upon OH-rebound,
and the radical loses its conjugation with the C=O π-bond.
An estimation of this conjugation loss to about 70 kcal mol–1 raises the VB predicted rebound barriers above the desaturation
barriers in energy.

In summary, the product ratios of desaturation
versus α-
and β-hydroxylation are dependent on the strength of the σCO orbital formed after rebound versus the difference of the
strength of the π-bond in the olefin formed and the loss of
conjugation energy of the radical with the carboxylate π-bond.
These energy contributions are dependent on the nature of the substrate,
and hence different products are obtained for substrates 1a, 2a, and 3a.

Conclusion
Overall,
this work provides a detailed insight into the stereoselectivity
and reactivity patterns of CYP OleTJE and the CYP152 family
in general. The enzymes’ biotechnological importance arises
from their ability to use H2O2 as an oxidant
and to convert fatty acids into valuable products via oxidative decarboxylation
and α- or β-hydroxylation. In this work, we show a novel
reaction pathway leading to α,β-desaturation of carboxylic
acids. All reactivities were investigated with selectively deuterated
substrate probes, revealing the rate-limiting steps. Linear fatty
acids generally react with CYP OleTJE by hydrogen atom
abstraction from the β-position leading to decarboxylation products.
The α,β-desaturase activity reported here is initiated
by hydrogen atom abstraction from Cα–H, which is supported
by the observation that the desaturation activity often is accompanied
by α-hydroxylation. The latter is preferred with substrates
bearing an activated Cα and is supported by the strong isotope
effect on the desaturation activity.

The product distributions
were rationalized with computational
studies which revealed that the reactivity highly depends on substrate
positioning and involves the carbon with the lowest hydrogen abstraction
barrier. Therefore, a weaker Cα–H bond initiates α-hydroxylation
and desaturation, and a weaker Cβ–H bond leads to β-hydroxylation
and oxidative decarboxylation.
