We report the highly efficient gold-catalyzed
hydrocarboxylation
of internal alkynes that operates under solvent- and silver-free conditions.
This new, simple, and eco-friendly protocol allows for the synthesis
of a wide variety of functionalized aryl and alkyl enol esters in
high yields, with Z-stereospecificity and good regioselectivities
and without the requirement for purification by chromatography. This
process represents an expedient, operationally simple method for the
synthesis of enol esters.

==== Body
Enol esters
are highly versatile
building blocks in organic synthesis.1 They
are widely used industrially in polymerization processes2 and have also been shown to be valuable reagents
in a variety of synthetic transformations.3 Among a wide variety of synthetic approaches previously developed,
the direct addition of widely available and inexpensive carboxylic
acid starting materials to alkynes represents the most efficient route
to access vinyl esters due to excellent atom- and step-economies.4 While the intermolecular addition of carboxylic
acids to terminal alkynes has been extensively studied,5 the use of unactivated internal alkynes has been
shown to be particularly difficult and requires high catalyst loadings,
long reaction times, and increased temperatures.6 Additionally, further challenges remain in developing the
next generation of such reactions, namely the regio-, stereo-, and
chemoselectivity (Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov products) of these
reactions. Furthermore, achieving this in a manner where products
can be accessed efficiently, with minimal waste and purification,
would be quite an achievement. There is a clear need for new methods
to overcome these challenges and limitations.

With its high
affinity for π-systems, gold has been shown
to be uniquely effective in the addition of nucleophiles to unsaturated
systems such as alkynes and allenes.7 While
numerous reports describe the cyclization of alkynoic acids to give
γ-lactones,8 examples of the intermolecular
addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes catalyzed by gold remain few.
So far, only two reports using Au(I) can be found in the literature.
In 2010, Chary et al. reported the hydrocarboxylation of alkynes using
5 mol % of [Au(PPh3)Cl]/AgPF6.5j This methodology was applied to various terminal alkynes
but was only demonstrated with four internal alkynes. In particular,
incomplete conversion and lower yield were observed when using unreactive
diaryl-substituted alkynes. A recent report by Zhang and co-workers
described a strategy using a tailored phosphine ligand to direct and
promote the nucleophilic addition to gold-activated alkynes.5k The addition of benzoic acid to three internal
aliphatic alkynes was examined and proceeded smoothly using low loadings
of [Au] but required long reaction times (12–24 h).

To
the best of our knowledge, no report of a highly efficient and
broadly applicable hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes using gold
and especially (NHC)Au catalyst systems has been disclosed to date.
Our group recently demonstrated that [{Au(IPr)}2(μ-OH)][BF4] (1a) is a highly efficient bifunctional catalyst
for the hydrophenoxylation of internal alkynes.9 Notably, this complex can be regarded as a dual-mode activating
catalyst providing Lewis acid [Au(IPr)][BF4] (1b) and Brønsted base [Au(IPr)(OH)] (1c) fragments
(eq 1).9b 1  

We envisioned that this strategy could
also be applied successfully
to accomplish other challenging reactions such as the intermolecular
addition of carboxylic acids to internal alkynes to produce a broad
variety of functionalized enol esters with hopefully excellent regio-
and stereoselectivity.

Initially, diphenylacetylene (2a) and the sterically
hindered 2,6-dimethoxybenzoic acid (3a) were selected
as model substrates. To our delight, the addition of 3a to 2a (1.1. equiv), at 85 °C in technical-grade
toluene (1 M) in the presence of 2 mol % of [{Au(IPr)}2(μ-OH)][BF4] (1a) gave complete conversion
to vinyl ester (4aa) as a single stereoisomer, after
16 h (Table 1, entry
1). The 1H NMR of the reaction mixture confirmed the stereospecific
formation of (Z)-isomer. Subsequently, various gold
catalysts were examined. Interestingly, the Brønsted base [Au(IPr)(OH)]
(1c) gave only 40% conversion, while the cationic Gagosz
complex [Au(IPr)(NTf2)]10 (1f) alone failed to catalyze the hydrocarboxylation of 2a (Table 1, entries 3 and 5). High conversion was obtained using [Au(IPr)(MeCN)][BF4] (1e) catalyst, although a longer reaction time
was required and the desired vinyl ester was formed along with 15%
of ketone side product due to the competing hydration of 2a (Table 1, entry 4).9c Complex 1e is known to form the
digold hydroxide 1a in the presence of water.9b These results gave us confidence that a bifunctional
catalyst enhanced reactivity. The solvent was found to also have an
important influence on the course of the reaction with toluene being
optimal (see the Supporting Information for further optimization studies). A slower reaction rate was observed
with a 1/1 ratio of 2a and 3a and a further
decrease of the catalyst loading to 0.5 mol % (Table 1, entry 6). To reduce the environmental impact
of the process, the reaction was carried out under solvent-free conditions.
Gratifyingly, using 0.5 mol % of 1a, 74% conversion was
observed after 5 h and the reaction was complete after 10 h, affording
(Z)-vinyl ester 4aa in 93% yield without
traces of hydration side product (Table 1, entry 7). As previously mentioned, digold
hydroxide 1a can be seen as the combination of [Au(IPr)(OH)]
(1c) and [Au(IPr)][BF4] (1b).
Since complex 1b is not a stable species, 1e is generally used as a substitute. We were pleased to see that using
0.5 mol % of both 1c and 1e led to high
conversion to vinyl ester 4aa (93%) as well (Table 1, entry 8). This result
strongly supports that 1a acts as a bifunctional catalyst
for the hydrocarboxylation of alkynes. Remarkably, these conditions
allow for a very simple and economical workup procedure; pentane is
simply added to the crude mixture and the pure vinyl esters can be
isolated by filtration without the need for chromatography
or any further purification. Precautions to exclude air are
unecessary in this procedure.

With the optimized conditions
in hand, the scope of the reaction
was initially explored using diphenylacetylene (2a) and
a wide variety of carboxylic acids (Scheme 1). The methodology proved to be broadly applicable,
and a diverse range of vinyl esters could be synthesized with complete
stereoselectivity. Therefore, a series of functionalized (Z)-diphenylvinyl benzoates could be obtained in good to
excellent yields (60–99% yield). The nature of the substituent
on the aryl ring of the benzoic acids had little influence on the
reaction yield, and a variety of electron-donating and -withdrawing
substituents could be tolerated, including bromo (3e, 3f, and 3j), nitro (3c and 3g), methoxy (3a and 3d), fluoro
(3i), and even substituted amine (3h) groups.
The use of sterically hindered benzoic acids did not affect the reaction
rate and led to compounds 4aa and 4al in
high yields.

and Alkyl Carboxylic Acids

Reaction conditions unless
otherwise
specified: alkyne (0.5 mmol), carboxylic acid (0.5 mmol), [Au] (0.0025
mmol), 80 °C. Isolated yields. Average of two runs.

Pleasingly, the addition of heteroarylcarboxylic acids
such as
2-picolinic acid (3k) and furoic acid (3m) proceeded smoothly without affecting the catalyst activity. Furthermore,
this methodology was also applicable to vinylcarboxylic acids such
as acrylic acid (3o) and cinnamic acid (3p), providing access to compounds 4ao and 4ap, in short reaction times and with excellent yields and complete
chemoselectivity. This reactivity is remarkable, as acrylic acid is
well-known to undergo very facile polymerization. Gratifyingly, the
methodology could be extended to several aliphatic carboxylic acids.
The reactions with these substrates proceeded much more quickly, most
likely due to their enhanced nucleophilicity, without any loss of
stereoselectivity, forming the product (Z)-isomer
only. Both formic acid (3q) and acetic acid (3r) were also successfully converted in high yields to the corresponding
vinyl esters. It is worth mentioning that, to date, vinyl acetate
has only been obtained in a maximum of 62% yield using alternative
methodologies.5j In addition, the particular
stability of vinyl acetate under these conditions is remarkable, as
this compound easily polymerizes to polyvinyl acetate—one of
the industrially most important homopolymers.11 Finally, a reaction was conducted on a 10 mmol scale (1.78 g of 2a), and a 92% yield (2.19 g) of (Z)-1,2-diphenylvinyl
acetate (4ar) could be successfully isolated after simple
filtration.

Encouraged by these results, the reactivity of both
symmetrical
and unsymmetrical alkynes with benzoic acid (3b) was
next examined (Scheme 2). Interestingly, the reactions were found to be faster with unsymmetrical
than with symmetrical alkyne substrates. In general, good to complete
regioselectivities were observed using unsymmetrical alkynes, with
the addition of benzoic acid (3b) occurring at the most
electrophilic carbon of the triple bond.

Acid to Unsymmetrical Internal Alkynes

specified otherwise: alkyne (0.5 mmol), carboxylic acid (0.5 mmol),

Ratio determined by 1H NMR.

Under
our previous conditions, both 4-octyne (2b)
and dimethyl acetyldicarboxylate (DMAD) (2c) were successfully
converted, again with complete stereoselectivity, to vinyl ester (4bb) and dimethyl fumarate (4cb) in high yields.
Remarkably, the reactions of both phenylpropyne (2d)
and phenylpropiolate (2e) afforded the vinyl esters 4db and 4eb in complete regio- and stereoselectivity.
Diaryl-substituted alkyne 2f underwent hydrocarboxylation
with good regioselectivity. Similarly, good regioselectivity and complete
chemoselectivity was obtained when reacting enyne 2g.
Finally, total conversion of unsymmetrical alkynes 4h and 4i into vinyl esters 4hb and 4ib was achieved with complete regio- and stereoselectivity.

Next, the recyclability of the catalyst was assessed. Formic acid
(4q) and diphenylacetylene (2a) substrates
were chosen as the test reaction for sake of expediency. Once the
reaction was complete, iterative additions of both substrates were
performed. As a result, 6.5 mmol of 2a was converted
to 4aq using 2.5 μmol of 1a, affording
an exceptional turnover number (TON) of 2610 for this reaction (in
comparison to a TON of 18 reported in ref (5j)). This attests to the robustness of the catalytic
system, as once again no precaution to exclude air and moisture was
taken.

On the basis of previous mechanistic studies,9b the following mechanism can be proposed for
the gold(I)-catalyzed
hydrocarboxylation of alkynes (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Proposed Mechanism
Two initiation steps can be envisaged. In a dual-activation
mode, 1a would dissociate into Lewis acid [Au(IPr)][BF4] (1b) and Brønsted base [Au(IPr)(OH)] (1c). The former would coordinate to the alkyne 2 to form
the π-gold-alkyne complex I,12 while the latter would deprotonate the carboxylic acid 3 to generate the gold carboxylate II.13 In a parallel scenario, digold hydroxide 1a could directly react with carboxylic acid 3 to form digold carboxylate III. This species, in the
presence of alkyne 2, would be in equilibrium with I and II. From this point, subsequent nucleophilic
attack of gold carboxylate II toward π-complex I in an anti fashion would lead to the formation
of gem-diaurated species IV(14) or σ-monoaurated species V,15 most likely in equilibrium—the
former being rather an off-cycle species.14b Finally, protodeauration with either H2O or carboxylic
acid would deliver the final vinyl ester 4. This represents
the possibilities enabling the transformation. Efforts aimed at clarifying
the exact mechanistic route leading to product are presently being
carried out in our laboratory.

In summary, we have developed
a straightforward and highly efficient
methodology for the hydrocarboxylation of internal alkynes catalyzed
by a digold hydroxide complex enabling the formation of various aryl-
and alkylvinyl esters in good to excellent yields with superb regio-,
chemo-, and stereoselectivity. In addition, the use of solvent-free
conditions not only permits a practical, operationally simple, and
scalable strategy but leads to faster reaction kinetics. The present
process represents a practical and atom-economical alternative to
existing synthetic methods to assemble vinyl ester motifs that are
not easily accessed. Further studies aimed at extending the reaction
scope and at exploring the potential use of 1a in other
transformations are currently underway.
