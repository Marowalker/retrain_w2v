α-Allenols
are attractive and versatile compounds whose preparation
can be a nontrivial task. In this Letter, we provide a method for
the prompt synthesis of substituted α-allenols via a catalytic
cross-coupling reaction which makes use of a nontoxic and cost-effective
iron catalyst. The catalyst loading is typically as low as 1–5
mol %. The mild reaction conditions (−20 °C) and the short
reaction time (15 min) allow for the presence of a variety of functional
groups. Moreover, the reaction was shown to be scalable up to gram-scale
and the propargyl substrates are readily accessible by a one-pot synthesis.

==== Body
Transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions have been established as one of the most important tools
in organic chemistry for the formation of C–C bonds of all
orders, as well as C-heteroatom bonds. The dominant metals in this
field are palladium,1 copper,2 and nickel,3 whereas
other transition metals such as iron are less explored. However, iron
is an inexpensive, nontoxic and environmentally benign transition
metal that in the past few years has gained new impetus.4,5 It has also been found that iron works well for cross coupling of
sp3-substrates including both nucleophilic and electrophilic
reaction partners.6

For several years
our research group has been interested in allene-chemistry,
in particular, oxidative palladium-catalyzed carbocyclizations of
enallenes,7 allenynes,8 arylallenes,9 and aza-enallenes10 as well as the dynamic kinetic resolution of
allenols.11 Recently our research group
published an efficient one-pot method for the enzyme- and ruthenium-catalyzed
enantioselective transformation of α-allenols into 2,3-dihydrofurans.
The reaction proceeds with excellent enantioselectivity by an enzymatic
kinetic resolution and a subsequent ruthenium-catalyzed cycloisomerization.12 α-Allenols are also desired substrates
for many other transformations such as the gold-,13 silver-,14 ruthenium-,15 and palladium-catalyzed16 cyclization or the palladium-catalyzed dibromination.17 They are also important building-blocks in total
synthesis of natural products, such as β-carboline alkaloids
(−)-isocyclocapitelline and (−)-isochrysotricine18 or amphidinolide polyketide alkaloids amphidinolide
X and Y.19

α-Allenols are conventionally
synthesized by the Crabbé
reaction,20 which for terminal allenes
is reliable but can be very substrate dependent for internal allenes.21 The latter procedure commonly involves the semistoichiometric
use of metals such as copper21b or cadmium.22 However, α-allenols, tetra-substituted
with respect to the allene moiety are not accessible via the Crabbé
reaction. These types of α-allenols have to be prepared via
transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling, mostly via copper catalysis,
utilizing alkynyl oxiranes23 or dioxolanones24 as substrates. In the case of propargyl oxiranes,
there is also an iron-catalyzed variant.23d However, the preparation of these highly reactive substrates involves
a multistep route.19

In light of
the extensive use of α-allenols and the limited
amount of methods for their preparation, there is a demand for novel
and complementary methods. On the basis of our previous work,5 we now present a novel synthesis of highly substituted
α-allenols via iron-catalyzed cross-coupling of propargyl substrates
with Grignard reagents (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction for the synthesis of highly
substituted α-allenols. Typical reaction conditions: 1 equiv
of substrate (0.1 M) and 1 mol % Fe(acac)3 in Et2O treated with 1.25 equiv of R4 MgX for 5 min at −20
°C and stirred for 10 min.

The reaction conditions are typically mild (ether, –
20
°C, 15 min), and the reaction requires a low catalyst loading
of 1–5 mol % of Fe(acac)3. With this strategy, the
hydroxyl group can be introduced on the opposite side of the alkyne to that of the acetate leaving group (Figure 1a) or on the same side as the acetate leaving group (Figure 1b). The approach therefore allows for the synthesis
of a wide variety of differently substituted allenols (Figure 1). The propargyl substrates
are in turn prepared in one pot from propargyl alcohols or terminal
acetylenes and aldehydes or ketones.25

The obvious benefit of the herein described iron-catalyzed synthesis
is the simple accessibility of the starting materials, the little
preparative effort, the cost effectiveness, the nontoxic catalyst,
and the mild conditions, allowing the swift preparation of a wide
range of substituted allenols.

We started our investigations
with the propargyl substrates 1 bearing the protected
hydroxyl group on the opposite
side of the alkyne to that of the acetate leaving group (Table 1).

As protecting group, a silyl moiety, tert-butyldimethylsilyl
(TBS) was chosen because of its orthogonal reactivity to most other
functional groups. The less-hindered trimethylsilyl (TMS) as protecting
group was unsuitable for the one-pot preparation of the substrate
as well as the allene formation. In this way, the otherwise acid-sensitive26 allenols can be easily formed in situ and for
example be directly transformed to acetates (vide infra). The Grignard
reagents can be divided into two main categories: those with and those
without β-hydrogens. The β-H-containing magnesium organyls
require only 1 mol % of Fe(acac)3, whereas the others require
5 mol % or more of the catalyst. This difference is most likely due
to different mechanistic pathways, as previous reports suggest.6c To reflect the two categories of Grignard reagents,
mainly benzyl and (3-phenylpropyl)magnesium halides have been utilized,
which also add enough molecular weight to the final product to avoid
volatility issues. The yields are generally high, and it is interesting
to note that sterically congested Grignard reagents such as (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl)magnesium
chloride give the highest yields (Table 1: 2g and 2q). The
mild conditions tolerate functional groups such as silyl ethers, carbamates,
and acetales (Table 1: 2a–2n, 2m and 2n, 2o–2q), as well as a variety of Grignard
reagents such as methyl, alkyl, phenyl, benzyl, homoallyl and (trimethylsilyl)methyl
magnesium organyls (Table 1 e.g.: 2m, 2f, 2b, 2c, 2h, 2e). The low yield in case of the MOM-derivatives 2o and 2p are attributed to a moderate conversion
of around 60 percent.

Another variation is when substrates have
the protected hydroxyl
group on the same side of the alkyne as that of the
leaving group (Table 2: 3). This not only extends the scope of accessible
products but also enables the preparations of allenols with a less-substituted
allene moiety (Table 2: 4a–4d, 4g, and 4h). For tri- and tetrasubstituted allenes, the yields are
comparable to those in Table 1. However, the yields rapidly decrease when going to less-substituted
allenes. To explore the tolerance toward halogens, a chloride was
introduced in the substrate. The chlorinated substrate showed good
tolerance toward magnesium organyls lacking β-hydrogens (Table 1: 4e).
However, in the case of β-hydrogen-containing magnesium organyls,
the chloro substrate proceeded with moderate yield (Table 2: 4f).

7.5 mol % of Fe(acac)3.

c 5 mol % of Fe(acac)3.

d R4 MgX (2.0 equiv), 5

The iron-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction was also successfully
applied to more complex molecules such as steroids, leading to a steroidal
allene in good yield (Scheme 1). This strategy shows potential to be used in order to gain
rapid access to a variety of functionalized steroidal compounds interesting
to medicinal chemistry or as precursors for further transformations.

Scheme 1 Functionalization of Steroidal Compounds
The protocol was extended to the transformation of the
silyl protected
alcohol into an acetate, which in turn is a valuable substrate for
transition metal-catalyzed transformations. This transformation can
be achieved in one step via a Lewis acid-catalyzed deprotection-esterification
sequence with acetic anhydride (Ac2O). However, this sequence
did not show very high yields and was expected to be incompatible
with Lewis acid labile groups such as carbamates. Hence, we decided
to choose the two-step route by deprotection of the crude allenol
with tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and subsequent esterification
by Ac2O catalyzed by the Steglich-base (DMAP), subsequent
to the cross-coupling reaction, without purification of the intermediate
TBS-ether nor the alcohol (Table 3). Furthermore, to demonstrate the scalability of the
herein described iron-catalyzed synthesis of substituted allenols
and subsequent transformation to acetates, the substrates have been
used on gram-scale, which worked well for both type
of substrates (7 and 8, Table 3). The procedure allows the
presence of ester or carbamate functions to give 10e or 10f, respectively (Table 3) and show good yields except for the butyl-substituted
allene which might in this particular case be mainly attributed to
the higher volatility of this compound (8b, Table 3).

In conclusion, we have developed
a mild and facile synthesis of
highly substituted α-allenols by the utility of a nontoxic and
cost-effective iron catalyst with loadings as low as 1 mol % at a
reaction temperature of only −20 °C. The iron-catalyzed
synthesis of allenols can easily be scaled up to gram-scale, it shows
convenient functional group tolerance, and it allows for the employment
of a variety of Grignard reagents. In addition, more complex molecules
such as steroids can be readily functionalized, which is of interest
in medicinal chemistry.
