In
small-pore zeolite catalysts, where the size of the pores is
limited by eight-ring windows, aromatic hydrocarbon pool molecules
that are formed inside the zeolite during the Methanol-to-Olefins
(MTO) process cannot exit the pores and are retained inside the catalyst.
Hydrocarbon species whose size is comparable to the size of the zeolite
cage can cause the zeolite lattice to expand during the MTO process.
In this work, the formation of retained hydrocarbon pool species during
MTO at a reaction temperature of 400 °C was followed using operando
UV–vis spectroscopy. During the same experiment, using operando
X-ray Diffraction (XRD), the expansion of the zeolite framework was
assessed, and the activity of the catalyst was measured using online
gas chromatography (GC). Three different small-pore zeolite frameworks,
i.e., CHA, DDR, and LEV, were compared. It was shown using operando
XRD that the formation of retained aromatic species causes the zeolite
lattice of all three frameworks to expand. Because of the differences
in the zeolite framework dimensions, the nature of the retained hydrocarbons
as measured by operando UV–vis spectroscopy is different for
each of the three zeolite frameworks. Consequently, the magnitude
and direction of the zeolite lattice expansion as measured by operando
XRD also depends on the specific combination of the hydrocarbon species
and the zeolite framework. The catalyst with the CHA framework, i.e.,
H-SSZ-13, showed the biggest expansion: 0.9% in the direction along
the c-axis of the zeolite lattice. For all three
zeolite frameworks, based on the combination of operando XRD and operando
UV–vis spectroscopy, the hydrocarbon species that are likely
to cause the expansion of the zeolite cages are presented; methylated
naphthalene and pyrene in CHA, 1-methylnaphthalene and phenalene in
DDR, and methylated benzene and naphthalene in LEV. Filling of the
zeolite cages and, as a consequence, the zeolite lattice expansion
causes the deactivation of these small-pore zeolite catalysts during
the MTO process.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In the Methanol-to-Olefins
(MTH) process over zeolite catalysts,
methanol reacts with a hydrocarbon pool inside the zeolite pores.
This hydrocarbon pool consists of aromatic and olefinic hydrocarbons
that can be neutral or charged by the zeolite framework, depending
on which step of the reaction mechanism is taking place. These hydrocarbon
pool species are methylated by the methanol feed and subsequently
dealkylated to form the main MTO products, i.e., lower olefins.1 Depending on their size, these hydrocarbon pool
species can also leave the zeolite as products themselves. For example,
small aromatics, such as methylated benzenes, can leave medium-pore
zeolite frameworks, such as MFI, which have ten-ring pores with a
pore diameter of ca. 5 Å. However, when small aromatic molecules
are formed in small-pore zeolite frameworks, such as CHA, with eight-ring
pores with a diameter <4 Å, these molecules cannot exit the
pores and are retained inside the zeolite pores. For this reason,
during the MTO process over zeolite catalysts, hydrocarbons accumulate
in the zeolites with increasing time-on-stream. These species can
be active hydrocarbon pool species that are being methylated by the
methanol feed and subsequently dealkylated to form MTO products, but
they can also grow into species that are not active in producing olefins
anymore. These species inside the zeolite pores deactivate the catalyst
by preventing access to the active species.2 In addition, hydrocarbons can also be deposited on the outer surface
of the catalyst, where they can grow into large polyaromatic structures
that also block the zeolite pores. Inactive hydrocarbons inside or
outside the zeolite pores that deactivate the catalyst by preventing
methanol from reaching the active sites or by preventing products
from leaving the zeolite pores are referred to as coke, and coke formation
is the main reason for deactivation of MTO catalysts. Following the
evolution of the hydrocarbon pool and the retained species is important
for understanding the MTO process and deactivation of the catalyst.
Accumulation of hydrocarbon species inside the zeolite catalyst can
be investigated using operando spectroscopic techniques, such as nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR),3 Raman,4 infrared,5,6 and UV–vis spectroscopy.6−12

Formation of hydrocarbon species inside the zeolite pores
can cause
the zeolite framework to expand. Zeolites are crystalline microporous
materials, and when the zeolite framework expands because of the formation
of hydrocarbon species that build up inside the cages, the lattice
parameters of the crystalline zeolite change. This change in lattice
parameters can be characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD). It
has been shown before using XRD that the buildup of hydrocarbons inside
the pores of the zeolite can cause the zeolite pore network to expand.
This phenomenon has been studied extensively by Wragg and co-workers.13−18 Primarily, lattice expansion caused by hydrocarbon formation in
SAPO-34 catalysts (CHA framework) has been studied using a combination
of ex situ laboratory XRD as well as in situ synchrotron-based XRD.13−18 In addition to SAPO-34, changes in lattice parameters of other small-pore
SAPO-materials, such as SAPO-18 (AEI framework),14 as well as medium-pore zeolite materials including ZSM-22
(TON framework)19 and ZSM-5 (MFI framework),
have been investigated.20 Wragg et al.
observed that in SAPO-34 zeotype catalyst with CHA framework topology,
bulky hydrocarbon species cause an expansion of the zeolite cages
in the direction of the c-axis of ca. 2–3%
during the conversion of methanol to olefins at a reaction temperature
of 440–500 °C, while the a- and b-axes showed almost no change.13,16 In a recent paper by Svelle et al., the deactivation of ZSM-5 catalysts
during the Methanol-to-Gasoline (MTG) process was studied using a
combination of XRD and other methods to characterize coke formation
and deactivation, such as thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and acidity
characterization methods. Different types of ZSM-5 catalysts showed
different expansion/contraction behavior, but using this combination
of techniques, the authors were able to define a descriptor for the
degree of deactivation of ZSM-5 based on the difference in length
of the zeolite lattice a- and b-axis.21 This shows that the amount of lattice expansion
or contraction caused by coke formation is dependent on the specific
zeolite framework that is used as catalyst. In this study, the lattice
expansion of three small-pore zeolite frameworks, i.e., CHA, DDR,
and LEV, during the conversion of methanol is studied and related
to the hydrocarbon species that are retained during MTO.

In
our previous work, we investigated the nature and evolution
of the hydrocarbon pool during the MTO process for the same three
small-pore zeolites (CHA, DDR, and LEV), using UV–vis spectroscopy.10 We showed that small differences in size and
shape of the cages of these small-pore zeolites results in a different
nature and evolution of the hydrocarbon pool during MTO, and that
this has implications on activity and deactivation of the three catalysts.
Furthermore, by combining operando UV–vis spectroscopy with
other characterization methods, such as GC/MS of extracted coke species
and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), it was shown that the main reason
for deactivation of these small-pore zeolites is filling of the pores
with hydrocarbon deposits, rather than the formation of coke on the
external surface of the zeolite. In this work, we combine operando
UV–vis spectroscopy to study the formation of hydrocarbon species
during the MTO process with operando XRD to follow the expansion of
the zeolite lattice. The operando XRD experiments are performed in
a unique laboratory diffractometer setup equipped with a Mo X-ray
source in order to obtain enough signal, without the need for synchrotron
radiation. The setup combines operando XRD with operando UV–vis
spectroscopy. Activity data is obtained at the same time using online
gas chromatography (GC). Three small-pore zeolite frameworks, i.e.,
CHA, DDR, and LEV, are compared. In this way, a link can be made between
the accumulation of hydrocarbon pool species, expansion of the zeolite
lattice, and MTO activity.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials Synthesis and Characterization
Synthesis
of the zeolite catalysts with CHA (SSZ-13), DDR (Sigma-1),
and LEV (Nu-3) topology was performed by seed-assisted growth using
crystals with the corresponding topology as seeds (0.1 wt %) in order
to reduce synthesis time. Synthesis of the seeds was based on existing
recipes with some modifications from the open literature.22−25 Ludox HS-40 was used as silica source and NaAlO2 was
used as alumina source. The crystals that were synthesized by seed-assisted
growth were calcined for 10 h at 650 °C, and subsequently converted
into their protonic form by a triple ion-exchange in aqueous NH4NO3 solution (1 M, 80 °C, 2 h, 100 mL per
gram of zeolite), followed by a calcination at 550 °C. The zeolite
samples used in this work are the same as studied in our previous
work, and a more detailed description of the synthesis procedure can
be found in the Supporting Information.10

The physical properties of the zeolites
were characterized using SEM and ICP-OES, whereas the acidic properties
were analyzed using NH3-TPD, and CO adsorption followed
by IR spectroscopy. The experimental details can be found in the Supporting Information.10

2.2 Combined Operando X-ray Diffraction and UV–vis
Spectroscopy
Using a combined operando XRD and UV–vis
spectroscopy setup, the nature and evolution of the hydrocarbon pool
was measured using operando UV–vis spectroscopy, and the resulting
zeolite lattice expansion was measured using operando XRD. The experimental
setup is built inside the case of a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer,
and a previous version of this experimental setup was described in
an earlier paper from the Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis group
of Utrecht University.26 In that work,
the operando XRD measurements were used in order to identify different
crystalline phases during different stages of a catalytic reaction.
However, in the current work, the setup was used to follow the change
in crystal lattice parameters of a single crystalline phase during
the reaction. A schematic of the setup is shown in Figure 1. MoKα radiation
with a wavelength of 0.709 Å was used. The X-rays were focused
on a quartz capillary (OD 1 mm, wall thickness 0.01 mm) using a Göbel
mirror. In this way, diffraction patterns of a catalyst bed inside
the capillary with a bed length of ca. 20 mm were recorded. Photons
were detected using an energy dispersive Lynxeye XE-T detector, making
it possible to filter Kβ radiation from the signal.

Figure 1 Schematic
of the combined operando X-ray diffraction and UV–vis
setup showing the X-ray diffractometer with the mounted capillary;
in the middle of the capillary, the spot of the UV–vis light
source can be seen (see inset).

UV–vis spectra were recorded using a high-temperature
UV–vis
fiber optics probe, connected to an AvaSpec 2048L spectrometer and
an AvaLight-DH-S-BAL light source. The spectra were measured in the
middle of the catalyst bed, in a spot with a diameter of ca. 1 mm.
This means that whereas the operando XRD patterns are an average over
the complete catalyst bed, the operando UV–vis spectra are
taken from a much smaller amount of catalyst, in the middle of the
catalyst bed.

The catalyst bed was heated using an infrared
furnace, and the
temperature was controlled using a thermocouple that was inserted
into the capillary and into the catalyst bed. Gas flows were controlled
using multiple mass flow controllers that are installed inside the
diffractometer cabinet. Both low pressure and high pressure gas can
be used, making the setup usable not only for the MTO process but
also for other processes such as, e.g., Fischer–Tropsch synthesis
(FTS)26 or Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefins
(FTO).

Products were detected online using a Thermo Scientific
TRACE 1300
gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with multiple columns and multiple
FID and TCD detectors in order to detect MTO products as well as methanol
and dimethyl ether.

In a typical experiment, 8 mg of catalyst
with aggregate size between
150 and 212 μm is loaded in the capillary, resulting in a bed
length of ca. 20 mm. The capillary is placed into the setup and heated
to 450 °C in O2 with a rate of 5 °C/min. The
catalyst is kept at 450 °C under O2 flow in order
to burn off any possible hydrocarbon contamination present in the
zeolite before starting the reaction. After 1 h, the temperature is
lowered to 400 °C with a rate of 5 °C/min, and the flow
is switched to He. Before methanol is introduced into the setup, an
XRD pattern is recorded. Subsequently, methanol is introduced into
the capillary at a WHSV of 3 gMeOH gcat. h–1 by flowing the He through a saturator that is kept
at ca. 40 °C, resulting in a MeOH concentration of ca. 34%. During
the reaction, activity data is obtained using online GC, and operando
XRD patterns and operando UV–vis spectra are recorded. After
deactivation of the catalyst, the methanol saturator is closed and
a final XRD pattern is recorded.

In order to determine the zeolite
lattice parameters from XRD patterns,
Rietveld refinements were performed on full powder patterns using
TOPAS academic V5, starting with framework positions from the IZA-SC
Database of Zeolite Structures.27 The background
was fitted with a 5-term Chebyshev function, as well as a 1/X background
function to account for air scattering at low angles. The lattice
parameters for the hexagonal unit cell and symmetry independent framework
atom positions were refined. The peak shape was described using a
pseudo-Voigt function, and the crystallite size broadening was described
using a Lorentzian function. To account for the coke in the zeolite
pores after the MTO process, carbon atoms were placed inside the zeolite
cage, and their occupancies were refined. In order to assess whether
observed lattice expansions were statistically significant, a paired t-test was performed. Using this statistical method, the
means and standard deviations (n = 3) of the lattice
parameters of the zeolite materials before reaction were compared
to those after performing the MTO reaction. The p-value resulting from this t-test represents the
probability that the changes in lattice parameters during the MTO
process are not statistically significant. In our work, changes in
lattice parameters with a p-value >0.05 were considered
as not statistically significant.

3 Results
3.1 Comparison of Zeolite Frameworks for the MTO
Process: Previous Results
In our previous work, the three
small-pore zeolite frameworks, i.e., CHA, DDR, and LEV, were compared
during the MTO process using operando UV–vis spectroscopy and
online gas chromatography (GC), and a more detailed discussion of
the comparison of the three zeolite frameworks during the MTO process
can be found there.10 In this section,
a summary of the results that are important for this work is given.
An overview of the physical properties of the three zeolite materials
is presented in Table 1. It can be seen that properties, such as crystallite size, acid-site
density, and acid strength, are comparable for the three zeolite frameworks,
meaning that the comparison of the materials is mainly based on the
differences in framework structure. The main differences in framework
properties are the size and shape of the zeolite cages, as well as
the dimensionality of pore structure (3-D for CHA, and 2-D for DDR
and LEV).

Using operando UV–vis spectroscopy during the
MTO process,
combined with GC/MS analysis of the retained hydrocarbons after the
MTO process, it was shown that the differences in cage dimensions
and pore structure between CHA, DDR, and LEV result in a different
nature of retained hydrocarbons during MTO. In the CHA cage, the hydrocarbon
species inside the zeolite cages are various methylated benzenes and
naphthalenes, whereas in the smaller and less symmetric DDR cage,
in addition to methylated benzenes, mainly one kind of methylated
naphthalene, i.e., 1-methylnaphthalene, is present. In the LEV cage,
the smallest of the three cages, naphthalene was found in the cages,
but methylated naphthalenes are too large to fit inside. Furthermore,
it was shown that the reaction temperature has an important influence
on catalyst lifetime of the DDR and LEV framework, because some species
that deactivate the catalyst by blocking the zeolite pores at lower
reaction temperature (i.e., 350 °C) are methylated and dealkylated
to form olefins at reaction temperatures of 400 and 450 °C. At
reaction temperatures of 400 °C and higher, filling of all zeolite
cages with hydrocarbon species is the reason for deactivation of the
catalyst.10

In UV–vis spectroscopy,
the difference in nature of the
retained hydrocarbons inside the zeolite pores could also be observed.
For CHA, in which the largest variety of hydrocarbon species is present
during MTO, the UV–vis spectra generally show broad, convoluted
features and the spectrum is dominated by a large band around 25000
cm–1, caused by charged alkylated benzenes and naphthalenes.
For DDR, a smaller variety of hydrocarbon species result in sharper
bands in UV–vis. The large absorption band around 25000 cm–1 is also present, and it has a sharp shoulder at 24800
cm–1, caused by 1-methylnaphthalene. In the small
LEV cage, the band around 25000 cm–1 is much smaller,
because the methylated benzenes and naphthalenes do not fit inside
the cage.10

3.2 Combined
Operando UV–vis Spectroscopy
and X-ray Diffraction
In our combined operando UV–vis
spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction setup, UV–vis spectra were
taken from a spot in the middle of the catalyst bed, whereas XRD patterns
were taken over the complete bed during the conversion of methanol.
In Figures 2–4, an overview of the data obtained for the different
zeolite frameworks on the combined operando XRD and UV–vis
setup is presented. In (a) and (b), operando UV–vis spectra
are shown as a contour plot and as a waterfall plot, respectively;
(c) and (d) show contour and waterfall plots of the operando X-ray
diffraction patterns; and in (e) and (f) the activity data is shown.
In principle, all data is obtained in a single experiment. However,
due to the long time interval between subsequent GC injections compared
to the time scale of the MTO process before deactivation, the activity
data was built from three identical experimental runs; i.e., the first
GC injection was timed at t = 0 min, t = 7.5 min,
and t = 15 min, respectively, and the three runs
were combined in order to show activity data with a higher time resolution.
Due to limitations of the experimental setup, the methanol concentration
could not be lower than ca. 34%, and the space velocity could not
be lowered further than a WHSV of 3 gMeOH gcat.–1 h–1.

Figure 2 Overview of data obtained
from the combined operando XRD and UV–vis
setup for the CHA catalyst: (a) contour and (b) waterfall plot of
operando UV−vis spectra during the conversion of methanol;
(c) contour and (d) waterfall plot of operando X-ray diffraction patterns
during the conversion of methanol; (e) methanol conversion and (f)
lower olefin yield measured using online GC.

For CHA, the activity data shows a period of methanol conversion
>90%, and during this time, the main products are lower olefins.
After
that, the methanol conversion drops to below 50%, and olefin yield
also drops. At that moment, the remaining activity is mainly toward
the formation of dimethyl ether (DME). This behavior is similar as
observed before for this catalyst, but with a few differences.10 First of all, changes in the activity, such
as the initial methanol conversion of 100% and the fast deactivation
appear to occur slower in this setup than in the setup used in our
previous work. This is probably caused by the difference in reactor
dimensions, as well as by the fact that the gas flows are low compared
to the relatively large volume between the outlet of the reactor and
the online GC analysis. Because of that, some mixing of the gases
occurs, causing changes in activity to appear slower. In addition,
the amount of methanol converted per gram of catalyst before deactivation
is lower than in our previous work, this is probably caused by differences
in reactor size and shape and by the higher concentration of methanol
used in this work.

The development of UV–vis bands is
very comparable to the
development of UV–vis bands that we observed before.10 In the beginning of the reaction, UV–vis
absorption bands are observed at 34000 and 26000 cm–1, corresponding to the MTO induction period, where the initial hydrocarbon
pool is formed. Subsequently, bands at 30500 and 25000 cm–1 appear, which grow until the catalyst deactivates. The band with
the highest intensity, around 25000 cm–1, is caused
by charged alkylated benzene and naphthalene species. Also, there
is a broad increase in absorbance over the complete range of wavenumbers,
due to the formation of extended coke species at the outside of the
zeolite crystals. After ca. 30 min time-on-stream, when the catalyst
starts to deactivate, the UV–vis spectra remain almost identical
with increasing time-on-stream.

The first XRD pattern shown
in Figure 2c,d was
taken before reaction, while the
catalyst was at a temperature of 400 °C under He flow. Subsequent
XRD patterns were recorded during the reaction. The time needed to
record an XRD pattern with sufficient quality was ca. 23 min, meaning
that the second diffraction pattern was recorded during the first
23 min of reaction, etc. Because 23 min is long compared to the time
scale of the MTO reaction under these conditions, it means that low-angle
peaks of the full XRD patterns are taken at a different moment during
the reaction compared to the high-angle peaks in the same pattern.
For this reason, the XRD patterns recorded during the reaction were
not used in order to determine the zeolite lattice expansion. Instead,
the XRD pattern before reaction and the XRD pattern recorded after
deactivation of the catalyst were analyzed in order to determine the
change in lattice parameters during reaction. All XRD patterns in Figure 2 correspond to the
diffraction pattern of chabazite.27 Between
the first XRD pattern (i.e., before reaction) and the subsequent XRD
patterns, some peak shifts toward lower angles are observed, which
are best seen in the contour plot in Figure 2c. A peak shift toward lower angles indicates
an expansion of the zeolite lattice. In order to quantify this expansion,
the XRD patterns before reaction and after deactivation of the catalyst
were analyzed using Rietveld refinement. The Rietveld refinement was
carried out on XRD patterns before and after reaction for three separate
experiments, and the results were averaged. The averaged lattice parameters
before and after reaction, as well as the relative expansions of the
zeolite framework axes are presented in Table 2. Examples of experimental XRD patterns compared
to Rietveld refined data are presented in Figure S1. From this, it is clear that the c-axis
of the CHA lattice, which is aligned with the long side of the CHA
cage, expands 0.9% during the MTO process. There is also a slight
expansion of 0.2% observed along the a- and b-axes, but this expansion is not statistically significant.
This means that the CHA cages expand in size during the MTO process,
and that hydrocarbons that are formed inside the cages during the
MTO process mainly elongate the cage. In previous studies, Wragg et
al. observed an expansion of the zeolite cages of SAPO-34 (CHA framework)
in the direction of the c-axis of ca. 2–3%
during MTO at a reaction temperature of 440–500 °C.13 The lower observed lattice expansion in our
work is likely caused by the fact that we used the silicoaluminate
counterpart of SAPO-34, i.e., SSZ-13 instead of SAPO-34, which was
used by Wragg et al. AlPO4-based frameworks, such as SAPO-34,
are known to have a more flexible structure than silicoaluminate frameworks.28 The possible species that are responsible for
the observed expansion are discussed in section 4.1. While these results show the expansion
of the zeolite lattice during MTO, it is based only on the XRD patterns
before reaction and after deactivation. The time resolution of XRD
is not sufficient to watch the zeolite expansion as it proceeds during
the reaction, since the majority of the peak shift has already occurred
while recording the first XRD pattern during reaction. In order to
follow the lattice expansion of the zeolite with increasing time-on-stream,
the experiments were also performed, while only measuring the peak
shift of one XRD peak in order to increase time resolution. These
results are discussed in section 3.3.

For DDR, the UV–vis spectra
as well as the XRD patterns
and activity data are shown in Figure 3. The activity data and corresponding UV–vis
spectra are very similar to those of our previous work.10 From the beginning of the reaction, there is
high methanol conversion, and during this phase, propylene is the
main product, followed by ethylene and butylene. As observed before,
deactivation occurs earlier for DDR than for CHA.

Figure 3 Overview of data obtained
from the combined operando XRD and UV–vis
setup for the DDR catalyst: (a) contour and (b) waterfall plot of
operando UV−vis spectra during the conversion of methanol;
(c) contour and (d) waterfall plot of operando X-ray diffraction patterns
during the conversion of methanol; (e) methanol conversion and (f)
lower olefin yield measured using online GC.

In the UV–vis spectra of DDR, an absorption band around
34000 cm–1 is present in the beginning of the reaction.
Subsequently, a band around 36000 cm–1 and an intense
band around 25000 cm–1 with a sharp shoulder at
24800 cm–1 due to 1-methylnaphthalene are formed.
The change in spectral features during the reaction appears more sudden
compared to our previous results, because in this setup, spectra are
taken from a smaller part of the catalyst bed, so there is less averaging
over the catalyst bed.10 There is less
increase in absorbance over the complete range of wavenumbers compared
to CHA, indicating that a less wide variety of hydrocarbon species
inside the zeolite cages is formed, as well as less external coke.

The XRD patterns before and during the reaction are shown in Figure 3b,c and correspond
to the DDR framework.27 The lattice parameters
of the XRD patterns before reaction and after deactivation, calculated
with Rietveld refinement, and the corresponding lattice expansion
are shown in Table 2. Whereas the CHA cage expanded mostly along the c-axis, i.e., in the longitudinal direction of the cage, the DDR lattice
expands more along the a- and b-axes,
i.e., in the direction of the width of the cage. The expansion along
the c-axis of the DDR cage is 0.3%, whereas the expansion
along the a- and b-axes is 0.5%.

For the LEV catalyst, the operando UV–vis spectra and the
operando XRD patterns, as well as the activity data of the MTO process
at 400 °C, are shown in Figure 4. A short period of high methanol
conversion is observed during which olefins are formed, and the catalyst
deactivates after a similar time-on-stream compared to DDR, as observed
before.10 However, due to the sampling
interval of the activity data compared to the time before deactivation,
the absolute numbers of the activity data for LEV and DDR are not
reliable.

Figure 4 Overview of data obtained from the combined operando XRD and UV–vis
setup for the LEV catalyst: (a) contour and (b) waterfall plot of
operando UV−vis spectra during the conversion of methanol;
(c) contour and (d) waterfall plot of operando X-ray diffraction patterns
during the conversion of methanol; (e) methanol conversion and (f)
lower olefin yield measured using online GC.

The operando UV–vis spectra for LEV are similar to
the spectra
in our previous work.10 The band around
25000 cm–1 is much smaller than for the other two
zeolite frameworks, indicating that less aromatics, such as methylated
benzene and methylated naphthalene are present inside the small LEV
cage during methanol conversion. The XRD patterns shown in Figure 4c,d correspond to
the LEV topology.27

As shown in Table 2, the expansion of
the zeolite lattice due to the formation of retained
hydrocarbons in the LEV cages is 0.5% along the c-axis, i.e., in the direction of the length of the cage. This means
that the LEV cage, similarly to the CHA cage and in contrast to the
DDR cage, becomes longer, but not wider during the MTO process.

3.3 Following a Single X-ray Diffraction Peak
Under the conditions described above, i.e., with an XRD recording
time of ca. 23 min, the XRD peaks shift so fast that the majority
of the peak shift already occurs while recording the first full XRD
pattern during reaction. While the full powder patterns obtained using
this time resolution were used to describe the difference between
the zeolite lattice parameters before the MTO process and after deactivation,
as described in the previous section, this time resolution was not
high enough to follow the changes in XRD peak positions during the
MTO reaction. Therefore, the MTO experiments were repeated under the
same conditions, but instead of recording the complete XRD pattern,
only one XRD peak was recorded. This reduced the measurement time
for the XRD data to 5 min, making it possible to follow the shift
of a single XRD peak with increasing time-on-stream during the MTO
process. The peaks whose shift between the XRD pattern before reaction
and after deactivation was most clearly visible were followed; i.e.,
11.6° 2θ (hkl = 104, hexagonal setting)
for CHA, 9.1° 2θ (hkl = 211) for DDR,
and 14.9° 2θ (a convolution of hkl = 134
and hkl = 042) for LEV, and the results are shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Peak shift
of single XRD peaks with increasing time-on-stream during
the MTO reaction: (a) 104 peak (hexagonal setting) for CHA, (b) 211
peak for DDR, and (c) 132 and 042 peak for the LEV framework.

For CHA, a clear peak shift toward
lower diffraction angles during
the MTO process is observed, which indicates a lattice expansion.
Because the peak also shifts during measurement, the peaks in between
the beginning and the end position are broader and have a lower intensity.
The lattice expansion, i.e., the peak shift of CHA reaches its maximum
after ca. 35 min time-on-stream, at the same moment that deactivation
is observed in the activity data. For DDR, a gradual peak shift toward
lower angles is also detected, and similarly to CHA, the maximum lattice
expansion is reached at the moment that deactivation is observed,
i.e., after 15 min time-on-stream. For LEV, the peak shift occurs
less gradual, and the maximum peak shift, i.e., the maximum lattice
expansion, is reached after ca. 15 min time-on-stream. This also corresponds
to the time until deactivation for the LEV framework.

4 Discussion
4.1 Hydrocarbon Species Responsible
for Zeolite
Lattice Expansion
Using the combination of operando UV–vis
spectroscopy and operando XRD, we propose plausible species that are
responsible for the expansion of the zeolite frameworks. As observed
in previous studies, the nature of the retained hydrocarbons depends
on the zeolite framework dimensions.10,29−31 These differences in nature of the retained species lead to differences
between the operando UV–vis spectra of the three different
zeolite frameworks. In the CHA framework, which has larger and more
symmetric cages than DDR and LEV, a wider variety of hydrocarbon species
fit inside the cages, resulting in broader features in the UV–vis
spectra.10 In Figures 6–8, the operando
UV–vis spectra during the MTO process are shown for the three
different zeolite frameworks, which show the difference in nature
of the hydrocarbon pool species between the three different zeolite
frameworks. For each framework, two species are indicated in the figures
that build up during the MTO process, and that have dimensions similar
to the dimensions of the zeolite cages. These species are plausible
candidates to cause the observed zeolite lattice expansion during
the MTO process.

Figure 6 (b) Operando UV–vis spectra during methanol conversion
over
the CHA catalyst. (a) Hydrocarbon species corresponding to the UV–vis
absorbance bands, i.e., tetramethylnaphthalene and pyrene, are compared
to the size of the CHA cage. These are plausible hydrocarbon pool
molecules causing the lattice expansion observed in XRD.

For CHA, we showed in our previous work using GC/MS
analysis of
extracted hydrocarbons that methylated naphthalenes and larger aromatics,
such as pyrene, were present inside the zeolite catalyst after the
MTO process.10 Pyrene was also identified
as a species responsible for unit cell expansion in SAPO-34 by Zokaie
et al.16 Methylated naphthalenes contribute
to the large UV–vis band around 25000 cm–1, whereas larger species, such as pyrene, contribute to the UV–vis
band around 17000 cm–1. In Figure 6, tetramethylnaphthalene and pyrene are compared
to the CHA cage, illustrating that it is plausible that these species
cause the unit cell expansion in the direction of the CHA c-axis.

For DDR, we concluded before that 1-methylnaphthalene,
which causes
UV–vis absorbance at 24800 cm–1 is preferentially
formed inside the DDR cage. Also, the presence of phenalene, which
contributes to the UV–vis absorbance band around 20000 cm–1 is found in DDR after the MTO process.10,32 Comparing the size and shape of 1-methylnaphthalene and phenalene
to the DDR cage in Figure 7, it is likely that these molecules can cause an expansion
more in the width than in the length of the zeolite cage.

Figure 7 (b) Operando
UV–vis spectra during methanol conversion over
the DDR catalyst. (a) Hydrocarbon species corresponding to the UV–vis
absorbance bands, i.e., 1-methylnaphthalene and phenalene, are compared
to the size of the DDR cage. These are plausible hydrocarbon pool
molecules causing the lattice expansion observed in XRD.

For LEV, the UV–vis absorbance at 25000
cm–1 is much lower compared to CHA and DDR. Additionally,
in previous
studies, only small amounts of methylated benzenes and naphthalene
were extracted from the deactivated catalyst, but no methylated naphthalenes.10,29 Comparing the size of tetramethylbenzene and nonmethylated naphthalene
to the LEV cage in Figure 8, it is plausible that these species cause
an expansion of the zeolite framework mainly in the direction of the
height of the cage. In the UV–vis spectra, there is also a
clear absorbance band around 20000 cm–1 visible,
which is usually assigned to charged aromatic hydrocarbons with more
than two rings, such as phenalene in the case of DDR. However, since
these species are not found in extracted species after the MTO process,
this band is probably caused by larger species outside the zeolite
pores in this case.

Figure 8 (b) Operando UV–vis spectra during methanol conversion
over
the LEV catalyst. (a) Hydrocarbon species corresponding to the UV–vis
absorbance bands, i.e., tetramethylbenzene and naphthalene, are compared
to the size of the LEV cage. These are plausible hydrocarbon pool
molecules causing the lattice expansion observed in XRD.

4.2 Combined XRD Peak Shift
and UV–vis
Spectroscopy
Two operando methods to follow the evolution
of the hydrocarbon pool during the MTO process were combined. Using
operando UV–vis spectroscopy, the nature and evolution of retained
hydrocarbon species could be followed, while using operando X-ray
diffraction, the effect of the formation of these hydrocarbon species
on the zeolite lattice was studied. In Figures 9–11, plots are shown for the three different zeolite frameworks,
combining MTO activity data with data from operando UV–vis
spectroscopy and operando XRD. The methanol conversion on the left y-axis shows the active period with a high methanol conversion,
followed by deactivation of the catalyst. The first right y-axis shows the peak position of the XRD peaks that were
discussed in section 3.3. The XRD peak shifts to lower 2θ values, indicating
that the zeolite cages expand. As a measure for the amount of retained
hydrocarbons inside the zeolite, the absorbance of the UV–vis
bands discussed in the previous section, i.e., the UV–vis absorbance
bands representing species that are possibly responsible for zeolite
lattice expansion, are plotted on the second right y-axis. During the reaction, the absorbance increases, indicating
the accumulation of these retained hydrocarbon species in the zeolite
catalyst during the MTO process. It was observed before for these
small-pore zeolite catalysts, that deactivation of the catalyst is
caused by filling of the zeolite pores with hydrocarbons, making it
impossible for methanol and products to move through the zeolite crystals.10

Figure 9 Combination plot for CHA showing the relation between
methanol
conversion (left y-axis), corresponding lattice expansion (XRD peak position, first
right y-axis), and amount of retained hydrocarbon
species (UV–vis absorbance at 25000 and 16500 cm–1, second right y-axis).

Figure 10 Combination plot for DDR, showing the relation between methanol
conversion (left y-axis), corresponding lattice expansion
(XRD peak position, first right y-axis), and amount
of retained hydrocarbon species (UV–vis absorbance at 24800
and 20000 cm–1, second right y-axis).

Figure 11 Combination plot for LEV, showing the
relation between methanol
conversion (left y-axis), corresponding lattice expansion
(XRD peak position, first right y-axis), and amount
of retained hydrocarbon species (UV–vis absorbance at 25000
cm–1, second right y-axis).

For CHA, as can be seen in Figure 9, the catalyst is
active for ca. 30 min, and during
this 30 min, the XRD peak gradually shifts toward lower 2θ values,
indicating an expansion of the zeolite lattice. Once the maximum XRD
peak shift is reached, deactivation of the catalyst is observed in
the activity data. The XRD peak gradually shifting toward lower angles
can indicate that the lattice slowly expands during the MTO process.
However, the XRD pattern is an average of the entire reactor bed,
so a gradual peak shift can also indicate that the lattice expansion
is sudden, but proceeds slowly through the reactor bed. The operando
UV–vis spectra are taken from a small spot in the middle of
the reactor bed, and the absorbance of the bands around 25000 and
16500 cm–1, which represents the formation of the
hydrocarbon pool species that are responsible for lattice expansion,
increases for the first 15 min, after which the increase in absorbance
becomes slower. This indicates that the formation of carbonaceous
deposits slows down after ca. 15 min time-on-stream, which is a sign
for deactivation. The fact that deactivation in the middle of the
bed is observed around half of the time before deactivation is observed
in the activity data, indicates that deactivation by coke formation
proceeds through the reactor bed; only once the deactivation has reached
the end of the catalyst bed, deactivation is observed in the activity
data. This is the typical deactivation behavior during the MTO process
in a fixed bed reactor.33−35 The combination of activity data
with operando UV–vis spectroscopy and operando XRD shows that
hydrocarbon formation that results in zeolite lattice expansion proceeds
through the reactor bed, causing catalyst deactivation. Once this
hydrocarbon formation and lattice expansion have reached the end of
the reactor bed, and there is no fresh catalyst left, deactivation
is observed in the activity data.

For DDR, a decrease in XRD
peak position, i.e., zeolite lattice
expansion, is observed during the time that the catalyst is active,
as can be seen in Figure 10. Once the maximum XRD peak shift is reached, deactivation
of the catalyst is observed after ca. 15 min time-on-stream. Similar
to CHA, the UV–vis absorbance of the band around 20000 cm–1, assigned to phenalene, increases until ca. 7 min
time-on-stream, around half of the time before deactivation is observed,
after which the absorbance stays constant. However, the absorbance
at 24800 cm–1, caused by 1-methylnaphthalene, keeps
increasing after deactivation of the catalyst. This indicates that
in the case of DDR, catalyst deactivation and zeolite lattice expansion
are more likely to be caused by phenalene, than by 1-methylnaphthalene.

For LEV, similar to DDR, the maximum XRD peak shift toward lower
2θ values, i.e., the maximum zeolite lattice expansion, occurs
after ca. 15 min. At the same time, catalyst deactivation is observed
in the activity data. The absorbance of the UV–vis band around
25000 cm–1, which represents hydrocarbon
species responsible for zeolite lattice expansion, increases until
ca. 7 min time-on-stream. After that, the increase in absorbance becomes
much slower, indicating that the middle of the bed, where the UV–vis
spectra are recorded, is deactivated.

5 Conclusions
During the Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) process at a reaction temperature
of 400 °C over zeolite catalysts with CHA, DDR, and LEV topology,
the formation and evolution of the retained hydrocarbon species was
monitored using operando UV–vis spectroscopy, while zeolite
lattice expansion was monitored using operando X-ray diffraction,
and activity data were measured using online gas chromatography during
the same experiment. All three zeolite frameworks showed lattice expansion
during the MTO process because of the accumulation of retained hydrocarbon
species inside the zeolite pores. The difference in size and shape
of the zeolite cages of the three frameworks results in different
retained hydrocarbon species for each zeolite framework. More specifically,
the species formed inside the zeolites during MTO that cause zeolite
lattice expansion are methylated naphthalene and pyrene in CHA, 1-methylnaphthalene
and phenalene in DDR and methylated benzene and naphthalene in LEV.
The interplay between these specific retained hydrocarbon species
and the zeolite framework structures results in a lattice expansion
of different magnitude and in different direction for each of the
three zeolite frameworks. The largest expansion is observed for CHA,
0.9% in the direction of the c-axis. Furthermore,
using this combination of operando UV–vis spectroscopy, operando
X-ray diffraction and online activity measurements, it was shown that
coke formation along the reactor bed, which causes zeolite lattice
expansion, causes deactivation of the catalyst. This deactivation
starts at the beginning of the reactor and progresses through the
catalyst bed. Once this deactivation front reaches the end of the
reactor, catalyst deactivation is observed.
