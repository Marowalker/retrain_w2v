Palladium/neocuproine
catalyzed oxidation of glucosides shows an
excellent selectivity for the C3-OH, but in mannosides and galactosides,
unselective oxidation was initially observed. For further application
in more-complex (oligo)saccharides, a better understanding of the
reaction, in terms of selectivity and reactivity, is required. Therefore,
a panel of different glycosides was synthesized, subjected to palladium/neocuproine
catalyzed oxidation and subsequently analyzed by qNMR. Surprisingly,
all studied glucosides, mannosides, galactosides, and xylosides show
selective oxidation of the C3-OH. However, subsequent reaction of
the resulting ketone moiety is the main culprit for side product formation.
Measures are reported to suppress these side reactions. The observed
differences in reaction rate, glucosides being the most rapidly oxidized,
may be exploited for the selective oxidation of complex oligosaccharides.

Introduction
Monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and
polysaccharides are involved
in a large variety of biological processes, such as cellular transport,
cell–cell interactions, and immunology. They are also important
structural components (for example, the cell wall of bacteria and
plants and the exoskeleton of insects consist for a large part of
polysaccharides).1 In glycochemistry, molecularly
well-defined carbohydrates are synthesized from a relatively limited
set of readily available monosaccharides (Figure 1) to study these biomolecules and the processes
in which they are involved.2,3 Monosaccharides and
oligosaccharides also serve as starting points for the synthesis of
other natural products and biomaterials.4

Figure 1 Overview
of various common glycopyranoses.

The field of glycochemistry traditionally relies heavily
on protecting
group manipulations to single out one of the hydroxyl functionalities,
but the attention has recently broadened to the development of protection
group-free synthesis routes.5 These studies
have led to methods that enable the selective functionalization of
the primary OH or the anomeric hydroxyl group of reducing saccharides.
Activating agents, such as 2-chloro-1,3-dimethylimidazolinium chloride
(DMC) and 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine, react selectively
with the anomeric hydroxyl group of monosaccharides and oligosaccharides.
Sequential nucleophilic substitution with azide, alcohols, and thiols
readily converts the resulting reactive intermediates to glycosyl
azides, glycosides, and thioglycosides.6−8 Modification of the primary
hydroxyl group is relatively straightforward by reacting the glycoside
with bulky reagents.9,10

Methods to selectively
functionalize one of the secondary hydroxyl
groups are still limited.11−13 Current research mainly focuses
on regioselective acylation and silylation, which is an approach that
has been applied in an elegant way in the total synthesis of the ellagitannins,
glucoside esters of gallic acid, and hexahydroxy phenoic acid, by
the Kawabata group,14,15 and these regioselective acylation/silylation methods have been thoroughly reviewed recently.5,16 We reported on the regioselective
oxidation of glucosides using Waymouth’s palladium catalyst,17,18 [(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2, in the presence
of 3 equiv of benzoquinone and showed that glucopyranosides give selective
oxidation of the C3-OH.19 For differently
configured substrates such as methyl β-d-galactopyranoside,
methyl α-d-mannopyranoside, and methyl α-d-xylopyranoside (for the structures of the parent pyranoses,
see Figure 1), unselective
oxidation was observed. We recently expanded on this work and showed
that the reducing carbohydrates α-d-glucopyranose and N-acetyl α-d-glucosamine also are selectively
oxidized with the catalytic system.20 The
C3-OH is oxidized, while the more readily accessible hydroxyl at C6
and the more reactive anomeric hydroxyl do not react primarily under
these conditions. Waymouth and co-workers recently showed that 6-deoxy-glycopyranosides,
xylopyranosides, and arabinopyranosides (for the structures of the
parent pyranoses, see Figure 1) also can be oxidized selectively with [(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2 by reducing the amount of benzoquinone to
1.5 equiv or using oxygen as a co-oxidant.21 Even substrates that contain an axial alcohol give the 3-ketoglycoside
as the major product, with methyl α-l-fucopyranoside
being the exception. In that case, the C4 ketone was also observed
in a 1:1 ratio, together with the C3-keto product. Moreover, 1,6-anhydromannose
and 1,6-anhydrogalactose can be oxidized selectively using these conditions.

Palladium-catalyzed regioselective oxidation is also feasible on
disaccharides and oligosaccharides. We revealed that the methyl glucosylglucose
disaccharides cellobiose and maltose,19 and 1,4-oligoglucoses up to the heptamer can be oxidized using our
methodology.22 Reacting these substrates
with the catalyst results in selective oxidation of the C3-OH of the
terminal glucose residue at the nonreducing end of the 1,4-linked
glucan (Figure 2).

and chemoselective oxidation of the terminal glucoside residue
in azido-β-d-ketomaltoheptaoside.

The scope of oligosaccharides used in these oxidation reactions
has been largely limited to oligoglucosides and before the method
can be extended to other (more) complex oligosaccharides, three important
questions need to be addressed, namely,(1) why does oxidation occur exclusively
at the terminal glucose residue of 1,4-linked glucans,

(2) why is the oxidation of galactopyranosides
and mannopyranosides (that are not conformationally locked like their
anhydro derivatives) unselective, and

(3) is there a difference in oxidation
rate for differently configured substrates,

since this is a potential tool for selective oxidation in complex
oligosaccharides.

One hypothesis for the exquisite terminal
selectivity in the oxidation
of 1,4-linked glucans is that the 3-OH of the terminal glucose residue
is sterically less congested than the 3-OH of the internal glucose
residues. An alternative hypothesis is that a free C4-OH is essential
for chelation with the catalyst. By monitoring the oxidation of protected
4-OH and 4-deoxyglucosides, it should be possible to assess which
of these hypotheses is valid. Bulky protecting groups will block chelation
and introduce steric hindrance, while deoxygenation of the C4 of methyl
glucose will only affect chelation. Previously, we also employed this
deoxygenation strategy to demonstrate that the C2-OH is not essential
to direct the oxidation to the 3-position.19

For the second question—why mannosyl and galactosyl
derivatives
are nonselectively oxidized—we originally hypothesized that
the presence of an axial hydroxyl group at the C2 or the C4 position
results in oxidation of these positions as well. However, the recent
observation by Waymouth and co-workers that conformationally locked
1,6-anhydromannopyranose and 1,6-anhydrogalactopyranose are selectively
oxidized at the C3 position revealed that probably not the substitution
pattern but other factors, such as the stability of the product, influence
the outcome of the reaction.

To study these hypotheses and to
determine the difference in reactivity
of the various glycosides, we synthesized a panel of glycopyranosides
and studied their behavior in individual oxidation reactions, as well
as competition experiments with the benchmark substrate methyl α-d-glucopyranoside (1). Here, we report the results
of these studies.

Results and Discussion
Previous
experience revealed that, because of the water solubility
of the products and the difficulties encountered in their purification,
there is no reliable relationship between the selectivity in the oxidation
and the isolated yield of the product. To circumvent this issue and
define a reasonably accurate method to determine the selectivity in
the oxidation, we decided to monitor the reactions by qNMR.23,24 Using the residual solvent signal as the internal standard, we could
both monitor the conversion to the product and characterize the product
in one operation. Methyl α-d-glucopyranoside (1) (Table 1,
entry 1) was used as a test substrate for this method. Under the reaction
conditions for the NMR experiment; 2.5 mol % of palladium catalyst
and 3 equiv of benzoquinone in DMSO-d6 (0.3 M), 1 was fully converted within 1 h with 86%
selectivity toward the desired product, that is, 2 was
formed in 86% NMR yield.25 This NMR yield
was confirmed by repeating the NMR experiment using tetrachloronitrobenzene
(TCNB) or mesitylene as an internal standard; in both cases, an NMR
yield of 86% was obtained. No other products were observed by 1H NMR. Although this yield is somewhat lower than obtained
on a preparative scale with the reported optimized conditions,19 we decided to continue performing the reactions
under the given NMR conditions. Having established this qNMR analysis
method, we applied it to several C4-OH modified glucosides (please
note that, in all cases, unless otherwise stated, the given product
is the only identifiable product, with an estimated detection limited
of 3%).

of 3%.bIncomplete conversion, 72% conversion
of starting material. Selectivity calculated according to this conversion. cPerformed with 1 equiv of benzoquinone. dIncomplete conversion, 68% conversion of starting
material. Selectivity calculated according to this conversion.

Oxidation of 4-benzoyl glucopyranoside 3 (Table 1,
entry 2) gave the
expected 3-keto product 4 with 78% selectivity, indicating
that the presence of a free C4-OH is not a prerequisite for selective
oxidation of the C3-OH. To mimic oxidation of internal glucose residues
of 1,4-glucans more closely, we synthesized C4-OH THP-protected derivative 5. The THP protecting group at C4, in this case, closely resembles
the terminal glucosyl residue at the nonreducing end, but without
its hydroxyl groups. As expected, two diastereomers were formed upon
THP protection, but the diastereomers could be separated and the stereochemistry
of the major diastereomer was identified by X-ray analysis (see the Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information
for the X-ray spectrum of the benzyl-protected C4-THP methyl α-d-glucopyranoside).26 It turned out
to have the configuration as depicted in Table 1, entry 3. Derivative 5 was
oxidized at the C3 position with 70% selectivity. The observation
that the bulky THP group at the C4-OH did not block oxidation demonstrates
that palladium-catalyzed oxidation of internal glucose residues of
1,4-glucans is, as such, feasible. Therefore, this suggests that the
selectivity for oxidation of the terminal residue in diglucoses and
oligoglucoses is caused by a difference in reaction rate, rather than
a complete shielding of the internal C3-OH positions. To validate
this, a one-to-one mixture of methyl α-d-glucopyranoside (1) and THP-protected glucopyranoside 5 was subjected
to the oxidation reaction, using half an equivalent of benzoquinone,
with respect to the total amount of glycoside. qNMR analysis confirmed
that methyl α-d-glucopyranoside 1 is indeed
preferentially oxidized over THP derivative 5 (product
ratio 3-ketoglucopyranoside 2:4-THP-3-ketoglucopyranoside
6 = 4:1; see Figure S6 in
the Supporting Information). Apparently, bulky groups on the C4-OH
do not influence the selective oxidation at C3, but have a considerable
effect on the reaction rate. To dissect if the reduced reaction rate
is caused by the inability to chelate to the C4-OH or by the steric
effects of the THP group, methyl 4-deoxyglucopyranoside 7 was synthesized.27

Upon oxidation
of 7 with the palladium catalyst in
the presence of 3 equiv of benzoquinone, the 1H NMR spectrum
after 1 h revealed that (i) all C4-deoxy 7 had been consumed
and (ii) at least two new products (Figure 3, 1 h) had been formed. Oxidation of the
C3-OH of glucosides typically results in a downfield shift of H2 and
H4 in the 1H NMR,28 but this
downfield shift was not observed for any of the products. Allowing
the reaction to proceed for 24 h led to an increase in one of the
products at the expense of the other one (Figure 3, 24 h). The 13C NMR and 1H NMR spectra of this major product showed similarities to
the lactone product obtained in the oxidation of β-glucopyranose
in our previous study.20 We observed very
distinct diastereotopic protons for the exocyclic CH2 group
and small coupling constants, indicating that rearranged product 8 is formed over the course of the reaction. The signals at
172 and 77 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum, which are indicative
for the ester carbonyl and the tertiary alcohol, further confirmed
that compound 8 had been obtained. Based on the results
obtained in the oxidation of glucose, we propose that the formation
of lactone 8 follows a similar mechanism (Scheme 1). Oxidation at C3 (9) is followed by intramolecular lactol formation (10). Sequential oxidation at C2 (11) and subsequent α-ketol
rearrangement results in lactone 8. This is apparently
facilitated by the absence of an equatorial hydroxyl group at the
C4 position, since the rearrangement had not been observed for any
of the methyl α-d-glucopyranosides used in the oxidation
reaction thus far. Based on this mechanism, the second species that
is observed after 1 h and slowly converted to 8 should
belong to one of the intermediates (Scheme 1). The absence of a signal for H2, in combination
with the long-range J-coupling and the diastereotopic
protons, suggest that these signals correspond to lactol 11 (Figure 3 and Scheme 1).

C4-deoxy (7): 1 h = 1 equiv
of benzoquinone, 24 h = 3 equiv of benzoquinone.

Scheme 1 Mechanism of the Rearrangement Taking Place in the Oxidation
of Methyl
4-Deoxyglucopyranoside (7)
The key steps in this sequence are the formation and subsequent
oxidation of the hemiacetal intermediate, and, therefore, we reasoned
that its formation might be suppressed by decreasing the benzoquinone
loading. Indeed, the initially expected C3-keto 9 was
the major product observed when 7 was oxidized with 1
equiv of benzoquinone (>60% conversion of SM, >90% selectivity
toward
the product). Batchwise addition of benzoquinone up to 2.5 equiv resulted
in the formation of lactol 11, which rearranged to form 8 when left for a prolonged time (>16 h, see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

Having confirmed that 4-deoxyglucopyranoside 7 is
oxidized selectively at the C3 position when 1 equiv of benzoquinone
is used, we employed the substrate in a competition experiment to
determine the effect of the C4-OH on the oxidation rate. In similar
fashion as that previously observed, a one-to-one mixture of methyl
α-d-glucopyranoside (1) and C4-deoxy 7 was subjected to the oxidation reaction, using half an equivalent
of benzoquinone, with respect to the total amount of glycoside. Surprisingly,
after complete consumption of benzoquinone, an approximate 1:1 mixture
of oxidation products was obtained, suggesting that chelation of the
palladium catalyst with C4-OH does not play a role at all! Therefore,
the selectivity for the terminal glucose residue in oligosaccharides
is fully controlled by sterics.

We subsequently focused our
attention on addressing the second
question: why does the oxidation of xylosides, galactosides, and mannosides
in the presence of 3 equiv of benzoquinone lead to complex mixtures?
Based on the observation that lactone 8 is formed when
4-deoxyglucopyranoside 7 is reacted with an excess
of benzoquinone, we hypothesized that a similar reaction may cause
side product formation upon oxidation of xylosides, galactosides,
and mannosides. As for deoxygenation of C4, the axial hydroxyl group
in methyl α-d-mannopyranoside 17 and methyl
β-d-galactopyranoside 20 and the absence
of an equatorial CH2OH, as in methyl β-d-xylopyranoside 14, may reduce the difference in the
free energies of the tetrahydropyranoside conformers. As such, this
may facilitate lactol formation and subsequent overoxidation and α-ketol
rearrangement. Rather than a lack of regioselectivity in the oxidation
of 14, 17, and 20 as reported
previously, side products may therefore have been derived from the
formed 3-keto products.

To study if this was the case, we first
subjected methyl 6-deoxyglucopyranoside
12 and methyl β-d-xylopyranoside (14) to the oxidation reaction. While 12 gave
oxidation of the C3-OH with 69% selectivity, the oxidation of 14 resulted in rearranged product 15 when 3 equiv
of benzoquinone was applied as a co-oxidant (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). Since an intramolecular
primary alcohol is lacking in xylopyranoside 14, the
formed 3-keto-xylopyranoside reacted with hydroquinone, resulting
from the reoxidation of the catalyst by benzoquinone. The resulting
hemiacetal rapidly oxidized at C2 and hydroquinone ester 15 was obtained after α-ketol rearrangement with 38% selectivity
as the major product. Ester 15 is the major product and
no other identifiable products were visible. Waymouth and co-workers
demonstrated that, in the oxidation of xylopyranoside 14, lowering the amount of benzoquinone or switching to oxygen as the
co-oxidant reduced the formation of side product.21 Switching to oxygen prevents the formation of hydroquinone
that, as a nucleophile, gives rise to subsequent reactions such as
hemiacetal formation, oxidation, and rearrangement. This was also
the case for our reaction. Upon carrying out the reaction with 1.2
equiv of benzoquinone, the expected 3-keto product 16 was observed (76% conversion of starting material, 84% selectivity
toward product 16) (Table 2, entry 3). Using our reaction conditions (room temperature
in DMSO, compared to acetonitrile at 50 °C in the case of Waymouth
et al.21), we did not observe the reported
C4-keto side product. Furthermore, switching to our deuterated catalyst
and employing oxygen as the co-oxidant also prevented the formation
of the hemiacetal and thus provides another means to reduce the amount
of side product.29

Oxidation of (Modified)
Glucopyranosides, Mannopyranosides, and Galactopyranosidesa
a Reaction conditions:
2.5 mol % of
[(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2, 3 equiv of benzoquinone,
0.3 M in DMSO-d6. Selectivity determined
via qNMR using the residual DMSO-d6 as
an internal standard. Unless otherwise stated, no other products could
be assigned by 1H NMR, with an estimated detection limit
of 3%. bPerformed with 1 equiv of benzoquinone. cIncomplete conversion, 58% conversion of
starting material. Selectivity calculated according to this conversion. dIsolated yield.

As anticipated, the oxidation of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside
(17) and methyl β-d-galactopyranoside
(20), in the presence of 3 equiv of benzoquinone, also
gave rise to the corresponding rearranged products 18 and 21 (Table 2, entries 4 and 5). Prolonged reaction times (72 h) were required
to obtain these products and further oxidation to ketolactone 19 was observed for the mannopyranoside. Based on the results
obtained in the oxidation of 4-deoxyglucopyranoside 7 and xylopyranoside 14, which could be converted
rather selectively to 9 and 16 when the
amount of benzoquinone was kept to the minimum, we reasoned that the
overoxidation of 17 and 20 and subsequent
rearrangement could be circumvented by decreasing the benzoquinone
loading. Although this yielded the 3-keto products 23 and 24, respectively, the selectivity was significantly
lower, compared to glucopyranosides and xylopyranosides. Various side
products due to overoxidation and rearrangement were detected in the
NMR spectrum (see Table 2, entries 6 and 7, respectively). Clearly, successive nucleophilic
attack of the C6-OH on the formed carbonyl is favored in these glycosides,
resulting in fast side product formation after the initial oxidation
of the C3-OH. Blocking the intramolecular nucleophilic attack of the
C6-OH should circumvent lactone formation, and the reported selectivity
for the oxidation of 1,6-anhydrogalactose and 1,6-anhydromannose supports
the validity of this reasoning. Unfortunately, the 1,6-anhydrosugar
approach cannot be extended to oligosaccharides. Therefore, we protected
the C6-OH of methyl α-d-mannopyranoside with a TIPS
group. Oxidizing this mannose derivative (25) with 1.2
equiv of benzoquinone surprisingly resulted in a decreased conversion
of the starting material (58%). However, calculating the selectivity
based on the converted starting material resulted in a selectivity
of 81% toward the desired 3-keto product (26). These
experiments reveal that (i) both mannopyranoside 17 and
galactopyranoside 20 are selectively oxidized at C3 and
(ii) subsequent side product formation could be circumvented by lowering
the co-oxidant and protecting the C6-OH. These results are in agreement
with the observations of Waymouth and co-workers for the oxidation
of pyranosides that contain an axial substituent, such as rhamnosides,
fucosides, and arabinosides, in acetonitrile/water at elevated temperature
(50 °C). The C3 ketoglycoside is obtained for the majority of
these substrates as well.21 In trifluoroethanol,
next to these pyranosides, even methyl α-d-galactopyranoside
could be oxidized selectively. However, for all of these substrates,
epimerization of the axial substituents was observed. Apparently,
trifluoroethanol at elevated temperatures induces rapid epimerization.
In the case of methyl α-d-galactopyranoside, epimerization
results in the more-stable gluco-configured product and intramolecular
lactol formation is unfavorable for this configuration. As a consequence,
epimerization prevents further oxidation of the ketoproduct. Under
the conditions we used (DMSO at room temperature), no epimerization
has been observed. Therefore, in this case, nucleophilic attack by
the primary hydroxyl group is favored, which results in side product
formation via the rearrangement described above.

Finally, we
aimed to determine the effect of the substitution pattern
on the reactivity in the oxidation. The prolonged reaction times required
for mannopyranoside and galactopyranoside oxidation suggested that
there might be a difference between these and the rate of glucoside
oxidation. Competition experiments of 1 with xylopyranoside 14, galactopyranoside 20, and mannopyranoside 17 were performed. These experiments revealed that the rate
of oxidation of xylopyranoside 14 is comparable to that
of benchmark 1. This is not very surprising, because
the primary hydroxyl group does not play a role in the oxidation mechanism,
and the β-hydride elimination, which is most likely the rate-determining
step, is not expected to be significantly influenced by this change
in substitution pattern. However, the competition experiments indicated
a clear decrease in reactivity of mannopyranosides and galactopyranosides,
in comparison to 1. 3-Ketoglucopyranoside 2 is formed preferentially over the corresponding product of the
galactopyranoside 20 (product ratio 3-ketoglucopyranoside
2:3-ketogalactopyranoside 24 = 5.7:1)
and over that of the corresponding product of mannopyranoside 17 (product ratio 3-ketoglucopyranoside 2:3-ketomannopyranoside
24 = 3:1) (see Figures S4 and S5, respectively, in the Supporting Information). Interestingly, in
the above discussion, we showed, with competition experiments, that
deoxygenation of the C4 position did not affect turnover of the substrate.
These results in combination with those of the competition of glucopyranoside
and galactopyranoside indicate that an axial OH considerably decreases
the reactivity of the substrate in the oxidation reaction, but when
the hydroxyl is omitted, the rate is not influenced. To complete the
study and to verify that the same was applicable for the C2 position,
we performed a similar competition experiment with methyl 2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranoside and methyl α-d-glucopyranoside 1. This showed that, also in this case, a product ratio of
1:1 was obtained. In other words, [(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2 can chelate to both the C2–C3 and C3–C4
vicinal diol, as has also been reported for palladium TMEDA complexes.30,31 Chelation to one of these vicinal diols is sufficient for oxidation.
Removal of either the hydroxyl group at C2 or C4 does not have a marked
effect on the rate of the oxidation reaction. However, an axial hydroxyl
group at C2 or C4 largely affects the rate of oxidation, as indicated
by the competition experiment with galactopyranoside and mannopyranoside,
respectively. This may be explained by an unfavorable chelation with
the cis diol or by an electronic effect induced by the axial hydroxyl
group.

Having established the importance of the glucose configuration
and the substituent at the C5 position, we realized that methyl α-d-glucuronide methyl ester (27) would be an excellent
substrate for this palladium-catalyzed oxidation. Glucuronic acid
is an important building block for proteoglycans, such as hyaluronic
acid and heparan, and is also commonly found in secondary metabolites.
If selective oxidation of glucuronic acid proved feasible, it would
open up a method to functionalize glucuronide-containing secondary
metabolites and glucuronic-acid-containing carbohydrate polymers.32,33 Because of the purification difficulties involved in the synthesis
of methyl α-d-glucuronic acid, we decided to synthesize
the corresponding methyl ester. When methyl ester 27 was
subjected to the conditions of the oxidation reaction, the desired
ketoglucuronide 29 was isolated in 82% yield, showing
that ester functionalities at C5 are tolerated by the catalyst.

Conclusions
Palladium-catalyzed oxidation provides an attractive means to functionalize
glucose-configured monosaccharides and oligosaccharides. This study
demonstrates that the oxidation of glycopyranosides with catalytic
[(neocuproine)PdOAc]2OTf2 occurs selectively
at the C3 position, independent of the substitution pattern. Deoxygenation
of the C2, C4, or C6 positions has a minimal effect on the selectivity
and substrates that contain bulky groups at the C4 position or an
axial hydroxyl group at C2 or C4 are also readily oxidized at the
C3 position.

However, the substitution pattern does have a large
effect on the
rate of the reaction. Oxidation of C4-protected substrates is significantly
slower than the benchmark compound methyl α-d-glucopyranoside,
which indicates that the selective oxidation of the terminal residue
in oligoglucosides is due to steric shielding of the internal residues.
Furthermore, competition experiments between galactopyranosides and
glucopyranosides, and mannopyranosides and glucopyranosides reveal
that axial hydroxyl groups at the C2 or C4 position reduce the rate
of the oxidation. These differences in reaction rate may be exploited
for the selective oxidation of complex oligosaccharides. For example,
it may be feasible to selectively oxidize terminal glucoside residues
in the presence of terminal galactoside residues.

Besides the
reaction rate, the substitution pattern also affects
the stability of the resulting 3-keto derivatives. Although the initial
oxidation is C3 selective, axial hydroxyl groups, deoxygenation of
the C4 position, or removal of the CH2OH make the product
prone to further reactions, such as α-ketol rearrangements.
These modifications presumably facilitate conformational changes in
the 3-keto products. We identified the major products by NMR, and,
in addition, showed that these competing side reactions can be largely
circumvented. When the amount of the co-oxidant benzoquinone is kept
to the minimum, when oxygen is used as the co-oxidant to avoid formation
of hydroquinone, or when the C6-OH is protected, the desired product
is the major product, although at the expense of conversion. Finally,
with the knowledge obtained, we realized that methyl glucuronide methyl
ester would be an excellent substrate for the oxidation reaction,
which provided a new route to functionalize glucuronic-acid-containing
biomolecules.
