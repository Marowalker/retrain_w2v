A better
fundamental understanding of the plasma-catalyst interaction
and the reaction mechanism is vital for optimizing the design of catalysts
for ammonia synthesis by plasma-catalysis. In this work, we report
on a hybrid plasma-enhanced catalytic process for the synthesis of
ammonia directly from N2 and H2 over transition
metal catalysts (M/Al2O3, M = Fe, Ni, Cu) at
near room temperature (∼35 °C) and atmospheric pressure.
Reactions were conducted in a specially designed coaxial dielectric
barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor using water as a ground electrode,
which could cool and maintain the reaction at near-room temperature.
The transparency of the water electrode enabled operando optical diagnostics (intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) imaging
and optical emission spectroscopy) of the full plasma discharge area
to be conducted without altering the operation of the reactor, as
is often needed when using coaxial reactors with opaque ground electrodes.
Compared to plasma synthesis of NH3 without a catalyst,
plasma-catalysis significantly enhanced the NH3 synthesis
rate and energy efficiency. The effect of different transition metal
catalysts on the physical properties of the discharge is negligible,
which suggests that the catalytic effects provided by the chemistry
of the catalyst surface are dominant over the physical effects of
the catalysts in the plasma-catalytic synthesis of ammonia. The highest
NH3 synthesis rate of 471 μmol g–1 h–1 was achieved using Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst with plasma, which is 100% higher than that
obtained using plasma only. The presence of a transition metal (e.g.,
Ni) on the surface of Al2O3 provided a more
uniform plasma discharge than Al2O3 or plasma
only, and enhanced the mean electron energy. The mechanism of plasma-catalytic
ammonia synthesis has been investigated through operando plasma diagnostics combined with comprehensive characterization
of the catalysts using N2 physisorption measurements, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), NH3-temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD), and N2-TPD. Four forms of adsorbed NHx (x = 0, 1, 2, and 3) species
were detected on the surfaces of the spent catalysts using XPS. It
was found that metal sites and weak acid sites could enhance the production
of NH3 via formation of NH2 intermediates on
the surface.

1 Introduction
Ammonia is one of the
most important chemicals used in modern society.
It is a vital precursor in the synthesis of many useful products,
including fertilizers, plastics, resins, explosives, and synthetic
fabrics. It also has the potential to be used for energy storage1−3 and as a hydrogen fuel.4−6 It is produced on an industrial
scale from N2 and H2 using the Haber-Bosch process,
which is typically carried out at 450–600 °C and 150–300
bar in the presence of a highly active catalyst. This process emits
over 300 million metric tons of CO2 each year and is highly
energy-intensive, consuming 1–2% of the world’s primary
energy supply: the largest in the chemical industry.7,8 Moreover, as the demand for fertilizers for food crops increases
with the ever-growing population, global production of ammonia is
expected to increase 1–2% per year.9,10 The
continued use of the Haber-Bosch process to meet demands will lead
to corresponding increases in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which will not only be environmentally and economically
unfavorable, but will also make it difficult to meet European targets
for reducing emissions.11 Efforts have,
therefore, been devoted to discovering greener, more efficient, and
more economically sustainable alternatives to the Haber-Bosch process
for small-scale ammonia production.8,12,13

Much of the energy expenditure of the Haber-Bosch
process is due
to the high temperatures and pressures required to synthesize ammonia
from N2 and H2. High temperatures are needed
to provide sufficient energy to dissociate the N2 bond
and drive the reaction. However, ammonia synthesis is an exothermic
reaction and thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures (eq 1), so high pressures are
also needed to shift the equilibrium in favor of the ammonia production
reaction because of Le Chatelier’s principle. The key to reducing
the energy consumption of ammonia synthesis processes is, therefore,
in activating the N2 bond at lower temperatures to avoid
the requirement of high pressures. 1  Biochemical
processes, electrochemical processes,
and plasma processes with mild operating conditions are considered
promising alternatives to thermal catalytic production of ammonia.8,12,13 Of these, nonthermal plasma (NTP)
is particularly attractive. NTPs generate highly energetic electrons
and reactive species (e.g., radicals, excited atoms, molecules, and
ions) that can significantly enhance reaction kinetics and enable
thermodynamically unfavorable reactions to proceed under ambient conditions
(e.g., dissociation of N2).14 Both the electrons and reactive species play a vital role in the
initiation and propagation of a variety of physical and chemical reactions
in low-temperature plasma processes.15−17 A variety of NTPs have
been investigated for ammonia synthesis, including dielectric barrier
discharge (DBD),18−21 pulsed streamer discharge, micro discharge,22 radio frequency discharge,23 and glow
discharge24 plasmas. Using NTP chemical
processes for ammonia synthesis instead of the Haber-Bosch process
could provide useful benefits: NTP reactions can be conducted under
atmospheric conditions on a small-scale; they can be started and stopped
very quickly by activating and deactivating the plasma; they have
the flexibility to be combined with renewable energy sources, such
as wind or solar power, to reduce the energy costs.25 Hence, increasing efforts have been devoted to the use
of NTP’s for the synthesis of ammonia.24,26−28

Combining NTP’s with heterogeneous catalysis
(plasma-catalysis)
demonstrably improves the performance of many plasma-activated reactions,
including ammonia synthesis, CH4 activation, CO2 hydrogenation, and the water–gas shift reaction.24,29−32 The enhancement in the reaction performance results from the synergy
generated by the interaction between the plasma and the catalyst.
The underlying mechanisms of the plasma-catalyst interactions are
complex and not fully understood, though previous investigations have
explored how the plasma is affected by changing the properties of
the catalyst, and vice versa.29,33−36 For instance, there is strong evidence to suggest that altering
the physical properties of the catalyst material (e.g., dielectric
constant, surface area, particle size, and void fraction) can modify
the electric field, which subsequently alters the density and mode
of the plasma discharge.26 It has also
been observed that the application of a plasma to a catalyst can change
the chemical or electronic properties of the catalyst (e.g., in the
metal oxidation state or work function), reduce catalyst poisoning,
modify surface reaction pathways, or change the catalyst morphology
by increasing the surface area or improving catalyst dispersion, all
of which can enhance the catalyst performance.33

In recent years, increasing efforts have focused
on the use of
plasma-catalysis for ammonia synthesis at low temperatures. However,
compared to thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis, only a few catalysts
have been tested and evaluated in plasma-catalytic processes for ammonia
synthesis. Sugiyama et al. demonstrated that coupling MgO and CaO
basic metal oxides with a glow-discharge plasma provided catalytic
activity in the production of ammonia, even though these catalysts
are catalytically inactive in thermal ammonia synthesis.24 Patil et al. investigated the effect of a range
of supports—including γ-Al2O3,
α-Al2O3, MgO, CaO, TiO2, and
quartz wool—on the synthesis of ammonia in a DBD reactor.26 Mizushima et al. evaluated the effect of Al2O3 membrane-supported transition metal catalysts
(Ru, Ni, Pt, and Fe) on the synthesis of ammonia using DBD plasma.27 Mehta et al. investigated the plasma-catalytic
synthesis of ammonia over a range of Al2O3 supported
metal catalysts (Fe, Co, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ni) in a DBD plasma reactor
by evaluating experimental measurements with density functional theory
(DFT) microkinetic modeling.13 They have
proposed that transition metals that bind nitrogen too weakly to be
catalytically active in thermal reactions enhance the reaction rate
more effectively in the plasma-catalytic reaction. The best turnover
frequencies (TOFs) were found to occur on the step sites of weaker
binding metals, such as Co and Ni catalysts, and on the terrace sites
of stronger binding metals, like Ru.13 Akay
and Zhang tested microporous silica-supported nickel catalysts packed
with BaTiO3 spheres in the plasma-catalytic synthesis of
ammonia in a DBD reactor at 130–150 °C.28

However, the knowledge of designing cost-effective,
highly active,
and stable catalysts that are effective in low-temperature plasma-catalytic
synthesis of ammonia is still limited. A better fundamental understanding
of the plasma-catalyst interactions and the reaction mechanism is
required to optimize catalyst design for ammonia synthesis by plasma-catalysis.
To this end, most of the previous works focused on the hybrid plasma
process by tuning plasma processing parameters or using different
catalysts; far less has been done to gain new insights into the role
of these catalysts in the plasma-catalytic process. In this work,
we have developed a plasma-enhanced catalytic process for the synthesis
of ammonia directly from N2 and H2 at near-room
temperature (∼35 °C) and ambient pressure in a specially
designed temperature-controlled DBD reactor that used water as a ground
electrode. The water electrode provided two important functions: (i)
the inherent transparency enabled optical diagnostics (intensified
charge-coupled device (ICCD) imaging and optical emission spectroscopy)
of the plasma and catalyst surface to be performed without disrupting
the performance, uniformity, and operation of the plasma, as can happen
with reactors with nontransparent ground electrodes (e.g., metal electrodes);
(ii) water cooling can effectively remove heat generated by the discharge
and maintain the reaction at near-room temperature (∼35 °C)
under different process conditions. To the best of our knowledge,
such a plasma-catalytic reactor has not been used for ammonia synthesis
at near-room temperature before. We aim to enhance the fundamental
understanding of the role of a catalyst surface in plasma-catalytic
ammonia synthesis at ambient conditions by combining operando electrical and optical diagnostics of the plasma reaction with comprehensive
pre- and postreaction characterization of the catalyst surface. The
reactions were conducted using three affordable and efficient Al2O3 supported metal (Ni, Cu, and Fe) catalysts.
The performance of the water DBD reactor in the presence and absence
of the catalysts was compared with the state of the art. A range of
catalyst characterization techniques was used to understand how species
generated in the plasma interacted with the catalyst surface to enhance
ammonia production. A strong relationship between the acid sites on
the catalyst surface and the rate of ammonia synthesis was identified,
with higher rates of ammonia production occurring on the surface of
catalysts that had a large number of weak acid sites. A plausible
reaction mechanism for the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis is proposed
based on the electrical and optical plasma diagnostics and characterization
of the fresh and spent catalysts.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
Five wt % M/Al2O3 (M = Fe, Ni, and Cu) catalysts
were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation using nitrate salts
(Alfa Aesar, 99.5%) as the metal precursor. Al2O3 catalyst support (3 g) was added to the solution of nitrate salts.
The slurry was continuously stirred at 60 °C for 2 h, after which
it was aged overnight at room temperature. The samples were then dried
at 110 °C for 5 h and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h. The catalysts
were then sieved to 40–60 mesh and reduced by Ar/H2 mixed gas (100 mL min–1; Ar/H2 = 7:3)
at 500 °C for 5 h before the plasma reaction. These catalysts,
after reduction, will henceforth be referred to as “fresh catalysts”.

N2 physisorption measurements were carried out using
a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument at 77 K to determine the specific
surface area, pore size distribution, average pore diameter, and average
particle diameter for each of the catalysts. All catalysts, including
the fresh catalysts and the spent catalysts, were pretreated at 300
°C under vacuum to remove any impurities from the surface.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the fresh and spent catalysts
were recorded by a Rigaku D/max-2200 diffractometer using a Cu Kα
radiation source in the 2θ range from 20° to 80°.

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) analysis
of the fresh catalysts was carried out using a Tecnai G2 F20 microscope
operating at an acceleration voltage of 300 kV. The catalyst samples
were pretreated with ultrasonication in ethanol, then a drop of the
resultant suspension was evaporated onto a carbon-coated copper grid.
The particle size distribution of each catalyst was determined through
the analysis of more than 300 particles from the TEM images.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on
a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi instrument using an Al Kα X-ray source
calibrated with C1s (284.8 eV). A low-resolution survey
and high-resolution region scans were measured at the binding energy
of interest for each of the spent catalysts.

The acidity of
the catalysts was evaluated by temperature-programmed
desorption (TPD) of ammonia and nitrogen (NH3-TPD and N2-TPD, respectively) using a Micrometrics AutoChem 2910 instrument
equipped with a mass analyzer. For NH3-TPD, 400 mg fresh
catalysts were pretreated at 450 °C for 1 h then cooled to 50
°C. They were then exposed to NH3 (5% vol.)/He at
a flow rate of 30 mL min–1 until ammonia adsorption
had reached equilibrium. Any physisorbed ammonia was removed by He
(50 mL min–1) at 100 °C. For the desorption
tests, the samples were heated from 100 to 700 °C at 10 °C
min–1, and the amount of ammonia desorbed was measured
by gas chromatographic (GC) quantification. For N2-TPD,
100 mg of fresh catalysts were treated at 500 °C for 2 h under
a flow of hydrogen, purged with He at 773 K for 1 h, and then cooled
slowly over 2 h to 150 °C under an N2 atmosphere.
The samples were then cooled to room temperature under He flow (40
mL min–1) to remove any physisorbed nitrogen. N2-TPD was performed by heating the samples at a rate of 10
K min–1 from 50 to 500 °C.37

2.2 Experimental Setup
A schematic of
the experimental setup is shown in Scheme. 1. The experiments were conducted in a coaxial
DBD reactor that used water as both a ground electrode and for controlling
the temperature of the reactor. The water was circulated between two
concentric quartz tubes, with the inner tube also functioning as a
dielectric material for the reactor. The reaction temperature was
maintained at 35 (±2) °C for the duration of the reaction
using a cooling bath. In this special reactor design–compared
to liquid–plasma or plasma-in-liquid reactors, where the plasma
interacts with the liquid directly–the circulating water did
not come into contact with the reactant or carrier gases during the
reaction. The length of the discharge region was 50 mm, and the discharge
gap was 2 mm. The DBD reactor was connected to an AC sinusoidal high
voltage power supply with a peak-to-peak voltage of 24 kV and a frequency
of 9.2 kHz. N2 and H2 were used as reactant
gases at a constant total flow rate of 56 mL min–1 and an N2/H2 molar ratio of 1:2. The discharge
area was fully packed with the catalyst (2 g). The plasma-catalyzed
ammonia synthesis experiments were run for 6 h and the gas products
were sampled every hour to monitor the performance of the different
catalysts. Catalyst reuse experiments were conducted using Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst, 2 h running time, and 30 min
purging time between each test. The specific energy input (SEI) for
each cycle was maintained at 26.8 kJ L–1.

Scheme 1 Schematic
Diagram of the Experimental Setup
The applied voltage of the DBD was measured by a high-voltage probe
(TESTEC, HVP-15HF), while the current was recorded by a current monitor
(Bergoz, CT-E0.5). The voltage on the external capacitor (0.47 μF)
was measured to determine the amount of charge accumulated in the
DBD. All the electrical signals were sampled by a four-channel digital
oscilloscope (Tektronix, MDO 3024). The discharge power was calculated
using the Q-U Lissajous method and controlled by a real-time power
monitoring system.17 The gas temperature
and the temperature of the catalyst bed (top, middle and bottom) in
the discharge zone were measured using a fiber optic thermometer (Omega
FOB102). The measured plasma gas temperature was almost the same as
the temperature of the catalyst bed due to the effective cooling of
the water electrode. In addition, the temperatures at different locations
in the plasma-catalytic zone were almost the same (±2 °C).
These findings show that the temperature-controlled DBD reactor using
a water electrode can maintain the reaction temperature uniformly
in the plasma-catalytic zone. Note that the reaction temperature can
be maintained at ∼35 °C when changing the experimental
conditions (e.g., SEI), which could be difficult when using a conventional
DBD reactor.

The reaction products were analyzed using a Fourier
transform infrared
(FTIR) spectrometer (FTIR-4200, Jasco) with a resolution of 2 cm–1. Each measurement was repeated three times, and the
measurement error was less than 4%. The optical emission spectroscopy
(OES) diagnostics of the N2–H2 DBD was
performed using an optical fiber connected to a Princeton Instruments
ICCD spectrometer (Model 320 PI) with a focal length of 320 nm (Figure S1). Gratings of 600 and 2400 g mm–1 were used to measure a wavelength range of 200–900
nm. Time-averaged optical imaging was performed by an ICCD camera
(ANDOR iStar 334T) attached to a macro lens (Sigma Macro 105 mm F2.8
EX DG) with an exposure time of 50 ms to observe the plasma discharge
behavior (Figure S1).

2.3 Calculation of Parameters
The specific
energy input and ammonia synthesis rate (μmol h–1 g–1) were calculated using eqs 2 and 3 2   3  where Ptotal is
the discharge power, Qgas is the total
gas flow, CNH3 is the concentration of
ammonia generated in the plasma process, and mc is the mass of fully packed catalysts (2 g).

The energy
efficiency (g kWh–1) was determined by eq 4 4  where Qgas-after is the volumetric gas flow rate after
the reaction.

3 Results
3.1 Fresh
Catalyst Characterization
XRD
patterns of the fresh catalysts are shown in Figure S2. Three major diffraction peaks centered at 2θ = 37.6°,
45.9°, and 67.0° were identified in the diffraction pattern
of pure Al2O3, corresponding to the cubic structure
of crystalline γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS 00-010-0425).
These peaks were also found in the diffraction patterns of the M/Al2O3 catalysts. Peaks of metallic Fe (JCPDS 06-0696),
Ni (JCPDS 45-1027), and Cu (JCPDS 04-0836) were present in the diffraction
patterns of the corresponding fresh M/Al2O3 catalysts,
indicating that the loaded metal species existed on the catalyst surface
mainly in the metal state after thermal reduction.

Table 1 lists the physical
properties of the fresh catalysts measured by N2 physisorption.
The Brunaur-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface area of fresh Al2O3 was 221 m2 g–1,
while the specific surface areas of the fresh Al2O3-supported metal catalysts were smaller, between 182 and 191
m2 g–1. Fresh Al2O3 also had the most substantial total pore volume of 0.43 cm3 g–1, compared to 0.36–0.37 cm3 g–1 for the M/Al2O3 catalysts. Figure 1 shows the surface
morphology and particle size distribution of the fresh catalysts using
HRTEM. Most of the metal particles on the catalyst surfaces were in
the range of 2–16 nm, while the Fe/Al2O3 catalyst had several larger particles of around 40 nm. For the Ni/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 catalysts,
the metal particles were much more homogeneously dispersed over the
surface of the support compared to Fe/Al2O3.38

The surface acidity of the fresh
catalysts was determined by NH3-TPD. Figure 2 shows the NH3 chemical desorption
peaks of weak (120–300
°C), medium (320–530 °C), and strong acid sites (550–730
°C).39 For each catalyst, the amount
of ammonia adsorbed on these sites is given in Table 2. It is clear that loading the Al2O3 support with metals reduced the total number of acid
sites (Atotal) by >50%, decreasing
in
the order: Al2O3 (0.97 mmol g–1) > Ni/Al2O3 (0.46 mmol g–1) > Cu/Al2O3 (0.45 mmol g–1) > Fe/Al2O3 (0.33 mmol g–1). There was also a notable reduction in the concentration of medium
and strong acid sites (Amedium), and an
increase in the concentration of weak acid sites with metal loading.
Moreover, the temperature of desorption for all three acid sites decreased
with metal loading–especially Cu and Ni. This indicated that
the presence of metals not only reduced the number of acid sites,
but also reduced the strength of the sites and, therefore, the overall
surface acidity of the support.

The interactions between N2 and the fresh M/Al2O3 catalyst surfaces were
measured by N2-TPD
(Figure S3). The temperatures of the onset
of desorption (Tonset) increased in the
order: Ni/Al2O3 (285 °C) < Cu/Al2O3 (290 °C) < Fe/Al2O3 (302 °C). The lowest Tonset was
achieved with Ni/Al2O3 at 285 °C, indicating
that some N2 was more weakly bound to the surface Ni/Al2O3 than the other catalysts.

3.2 Plasma Synthesis of Ammonia over Transition
Metal Catalysts
A comparison of the different catalyst performances–with
regards to NH3 synthesis rates and yields, at an SEI of
26.8 kJ L–1 is shown in Figure 3a. The use of Al2O3 support with DBD showed a notable improvement in the rate of ammonia
synthesis compared to the reaction without catalyst (plasma only).
The presence of a transition metal supported on Al2O3 further enhanced the synthesis rate, with the catalyst activity
decreasing in the order: Ni/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Al2O3 > plasma only. Ni/Al2O3 gave
the best synthesis rate of 390 μmol g–1 h–1 and a yield of 0.77%, whereas Fe/Al2O3 only slightly enhanced the NH3 synthesis rate
compared to Al2O3. The observed trend in activity
may have been due to stronger adsorption of N2 species
on Fe active sites than on the other transition metals or active surface
sites. This has been reported in previous works to slow down the rate
of ammonia synthesis by increasing the activation energy barrier for
hydrogenation.13 All the catalysts showed
excellent stability in performance over 6 h without any deactivation
(Figure 3c). Also,
as shown in Figure 3d, both the NH3 synthesis rate and the energy efficiency
of Ni/Al2O3 remained constant over 5 reuse cycles.
This provided a good indicator of the long-term stability of the catalysts
in the reaction.

SEI of 26.8
kJ L–1. (b) SEI dependence of the NH3 synthesis rate using different catalysts. (c) Stability for different
catalysts. (d) Catalyst reuse experiments over Ni/Al2O3 in NH3 synthesis with the rates and energy efficiencies
at an SEI of 26.8 kJ L–1.

The influence of the catalysts on the NH3 synthesis
rate at different SEI is shown in Figure 3b. SEI was altered by varying the discharge
power at a constant total flow rate; Note that the use of a water
electrode was able to maintain the reaction temperature at ∼35
°C when changing the SEI. The rate increased considerably as
the SEI increased, regardless of which catalyst was used; for instance,
the NH3 synthesis rate increased from 306 to 471 μmol
g–1 h–1 when the SEI increased
from 10.7 to 58.9 kJ L–1 in the presence of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. This is most likely because increasing
the discharge power generated more active species in the plasma that
can react to form ammonia. The effect of SEI on the energy efficiency
of the plasma process using different catalysts is shown in Figure S8. The energy efficiency for ammonia
synthesis greatly dropped when increasing the SEI, again regardless
of which catalyst was used. Increasing the discharge power of a plasma
produces more energetic electrons that can interact with atoms and
molecules to generate active species for ammonia synthesis. As the
SEI increases, the ratio of energetic electrons to atoms/molecules
in the discharge zone increases, resulting in more electron-atom/electron-molecule
interactions and the production of more active species; however, a
greater proportion of electrons will not participate in effective
collisions and their energy is wasted, thus reducing the energy efficiency
of the process. Compared to the plasma only reaction, packing the
DBD with a catalyst enhanced the energy efficiency for the synthesis
of ammonia, especially for Ni/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3, which showed the joint-highest energy efficiencies
at each SEI.

The results of the best catalytic performance obtained
in this
work, using Ni/Al2O3 as a catalyst, are compared
with the catalytic performances of other Ni-based catalyst systems
for plasma-enhanced ammonia synthesis from the literature in Table S4. Akay et al. achieved an energy efficiency
of 0.57 g kWh–1 using a mixture of Ni/SiO2 and BaTiO3, which was almost double that obtained in
this work; however, 173 g of catalyst was required in their reaction,
whereas only 2 g of catalyst was used in our system.28 Iwamoto et al. achieved the highest synthesis rate of 1920
μmol h–1, but with a much lower energy efficiency
of 0.02 g kWh–1.40 Our
Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with a water-cooled electrode
DBD system, therefore, provided a competitive ammonia synthesis rate
and good energy efficiency using only a small amount of catalyst.

3.3 Evaluation of the Spent Catalysts after Reaction
It is well-known that the physicochemical properties of catalysts
can be changed after their use in plasma reactions.41 To investigate the effect of plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis
on the catalysts used in this work, spent catalysts were collected
after they were used for ammonia synthesis with plasma at an SEI of
26.8 kJ L–1 for 90 min. A comparison of the physicochemical
properties of the fresh and spent (after reaction) catalysts, as determined
by N2-physisorption measurements, are shown in Table S1. The specific surface areas of the spent
catalysts (158–200 m2 g–1) were
smaller than those of the fresh catalysts (182–221 m2 g–1), the total pore volumes of the spent catalysts
had decreased from 0.36–0.43 (fresh catalysts) to 0.32–0.39
cm3 g–1, and the average pore diameters
of the spent catalysts increased by 0.5–2.4% after the plasma
reaction. These observations could be attributed to the collapse of
microchannels in the catalyst structure by the collision of energetic
particles.41 The nitrogen isotherms of
the fresh and spent catalysts are compared in Figure 4. All samples exhibited type-IV isotherms
with H1 hysteresis loops and steep increases in the relative pressure
range of 0.5 < P/P0 < 0.9, indicating that all of the samples had mesoporous structures.42,43 This suggests that the reactions in plasma did not have a significant
impact on the main pore structures of the catalysts.

Figure 4 N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms of (a) Al2O3, (b) Fe/Al2O3, (c) Ni/Al2O3, and (d) Cu/Al2O3.

The surface acidity of
fresh and spent samples of the best performing
catalyst, Ni/Al2O3, were evaluated by NH3-TPD. The results are shown in Figure 5. The concentration of acid sites was lower
on the surface of the spent catalyst than on the fresh catalyst (Figure 5b), indicating that
some sites had been lost during the reaction. This corresponds with
the loss of surface area (see Table S1).
A new peak is present in the results for the spent catalyst at a desorption
temperature of 320 °C (Figure 5a), which suggested that a new type of acid site had
been produced on the catalyst surface during the reaction that was
more acidic than the weak sites and less acidic than the medium sites
on the surface of the fresh catalyst. The alteration to the sites
is likely the result of interactions and collisions with excited particles
produced in the plasma.41

profiles for fresh and spent Ni/Al2O3. (b) Comparison
of total acid amounts for fresh and
spent Ni/Al2O3.

XPS measurements were conducted to detect the presence of NHx (where x = 0, 1, 2, or
3) species on the surface of the spent catalysts. The results of the
N 1s core level measurements for each catalyst are shown in Figure 6a, while the proportions
of the individual peaks assigned to NHx species are given in Figure 6b and Table S2. The assignments
for the NHx peaks were determined from
the literature.44−46 The concentrations of adsorbed NH3 and
NH2 were inversely proportional to each other, with the
concentration of NH3 decreasing in the order: Al2O3> Fe/Al2O3> Cu/Al2O3> Ni/Al2O3 and the concentration
of
NH2 increasing in the order: Ni/Al2O3> Cu/Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Al2O3. Higher proportions of NH and N
were
detected on the surface of Fe/Al2O3 than on
the other catalysts, signifying that these species were more stable
on the surface of Fe/Al2O3, making them slightly
less reactive, and thus slower to form ammonia. Lower concentrations
of N on the surfaces of Ni/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 may indicate that less direct N2 dissociation
occurs on their surfaces than on the surface of Fe/Al2O3. Instead, weakly adsorbed vibrationally active N2 species may be more important for ammonia synthesis on their surfaces.
Despite there being only small concentrations of NHx species detected on the surface of the spent catalyst, these
relationships may provide an insight into the importance of these
species in surface-mediated reactions in atmospheric pressure, nonthermal
plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis reactions, as discussed in section 4 of this paper.

3.4 Plasma
Characterization for NH3 Synthesis Using Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 Catalysts
The plasmas produced in N2–H2 gas using
different reactor configurations
(plasma only, Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3) were characterized using ICCD and BOLSIG+ calculations.47 Note that there were no obvious changes to the
discharge properties when packing the discharge area with different
M/Al2O3 catalysts; therefore, only the results
for the catalyst that gave the best performance in plasma-catalytic
synthesis of ammonia, Ni/Al2O3, will be discussed
here.

Images of the discharge areas of unpacked, Al2O3-packed and Ni/Al2O3-packed reactor
configurations, are shown with the plasma off in Figure 7a–c, respectively. The
time-averaged ICCD images presented in Figure 7d–f show the emission in the discharge
area. Figure 7d shows
typical filaments were produced in the discharge area in the absence
of packing material. Filling the entire discharge gap with Al2O3 or Ni/Al2O3 (Figure 7e and f, respectively)
significantly reduced the gas void in the plasma-catalyst zone. This
reduces the generation of filamentary discharges while enhancing the
formation of surface discharges due to the presence of catalyst surfaces
in the discharge area, which has been well demonstrated in both experimental
and modeling studies of packed bed DBD reactors.16,48,49 This phenomenon can also be confirmed from
the difference of current discharge signals using unpacked and packed
discharges. As shown in Figure S5c, compared
to the discharge without a catalyst, the current pulses appear denser
in the discharge packed with Al2O3 or Ni/Al2O3 due to the presence of more surface discharge
with catalyst packing. The number of current pulses with an amplitude
larger than 30% of the peak current in one period (Figure S5c) was determined, after extracting the sinusoidal
displacement current, by using an asymmetric least-square method.
The number of current pulses in the DBD packed with Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 are 2.3 and 2.9
times higher than that without packing catalysts, respectively. Compared
to the discharge packed with Al2O3 only, the
coupling of the DBD with Ni/Al2O3 promoted the
expansion of the discharge and inhibited the formation of intense
localized discharge in the plasma-catalyst zone. This is due to the
presence of conductive Ni nanoparticles on the surface of the catalyst.
A similar phenomenon was also observed in previous works.50,51

images without discharge; (d–f) photos with discharge (exposure
time: 50 ms).

To further understand the characteristics
of the discharges produced
in the different reactor configurations, electrical diagnostics were
carried out and a number of discharge parameters were calculated using
electrical signals together with the U-Q Lissajous figures (Table 3 and Figure 8a–c).52 The method for calculating the reduced electrical field
(E/N) is given in section 5 of the Supporting
Information. The presence of the packing materials in the discharge
area enhanced the average electric field (E) from 14.7 kV cm–1 with plasma only to 18.5 kV cm–1 and 19.3 kV cm–1 with Al2O3 or Ni/Al2O3 packing, respectively, although the shape of Lissajous
figures was almost the same (Figure 8a–c). The notable improvement in the average
electric field produced by packing is likely the result of increased
charge deposition. This is due to more effective polarization at the
contact points of the packing particles with increasing dielectric
constant of the materials.16,52−55 The mean electron energy and the electron energy distribution function
(EEDF) were calculated with the Boltzmann equation using BOLSIG+.47 The order of the mean electron energies was
Ni/Al2O3 (3.24 eV) > Al2O3 (3.06 eV) > plasma only (2.19 eV; Figure 8d), which corresponds with the enhancement
of the electric field (see Figure 8). Furthermore, a plot of the electron energy distribution
functions against the mean electron energies (Figure S7) shows that packing the discharge area with Ni/Al2O3 generated more electrons with higher energies,
especially above 2.24 eV. However, the mean electron density (ne, Table 3) of the discharge slightly decreased with the inclusion of
packing materials.

The relationship between the rate coefficients and
the reduced
electric field (E/N) for the most common electron impact reactions
in N2–H2 plasma were calculated using
BOLSIG+, as shown in Figure 9. The rate coefficients for all of the reactions increased
with increasing E/N. In the presence of catalysts, the reaction rates
increased in the order: Ni/Al2O3 > Al2O3 > plasma only, in line with the increasing
E/N and
mean electron energy of the plasma (Figure 8d). These results suggest that increasing
E/N and the mean electron energy increased the frequency of effective
electron impact reactions to generate radicals and vibrationally excited
species (see Figure 9) that can react to produce ammonia.

4 Discussion
4.1 Correlation of Acid Sites
to the Ammonia Synthesis
The relationship between the concentrations
of weak and medium
+ strong acid sites against log10 of the turnover frequency
for each M/Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Figure 10. The TOF increased
with increasing concentration of weak acid sites and decreased with
increasing concentration of medium + strong acid sites. The highest
TOF was achieved with Ni/Al2O3 (2.16 ×
10–3 s–1), which had the highest
concentration of weak acid sites and the lowest concentration of medium
+ strong acid sites. The lowest TOF was obtained with Fe/Al2O3 (1.63 × 10–3 s–1), which had the lowest concentration of weak acid sites and the
highest concentration of medium + strong acid sites. These results
indicate that there is a direct correlation between catalyst performance
and the strength of the acid sites on the surface. To better understand
these results, the reactions and adsorbed species on the catalysts
were investigated.

Figure 10 Correlation between log10 (TOF, s–1) with weak and medium + strong acid sites.

The equations for many of the known reactions that can occur in
the plasma-catalytic synthesis of ammonia from the literature are
compiled in Table S5. Reactions that take
place on the catalyst surface are believed to significantly enhance
the reaction rate via interactions between the reactants and active
metal and acid sites on the surface of the catalyst.23 These active sites operate by providing multiple functions:
they can adsorb active species (e.g., NHx, Hα, N2+, etc.) from the
plasma phase onto the surface to improve the localized concentration
of reactants (eqs S1–S4), they can aid dissociation of adsorbed
molecular species to more active intermediate species (equations S16–S19),
and they can facilitate reactions with adsorbed species (eqs S5–S15)
to promote NH3 synthesis. It was proposed by Shah et al.
that surface-adsorbed NH2(s) is the most important intermediate
in the production of ammonia.23 NH2 (s) is formed in situ by direct adsorption of NH2 onto the surface from the gas-phase, reactions between NH radicals
from the gas phase with surface adsorbed species, and reactions with
surface adsorbed NH via both the Eley–Rideal (E-R) mechanism
(Table S5, eq S6: NH + H (s) → NH2 (s)) and the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
(L-H) mechanism (eq S13: NH (s) + H (s)
→ NH2 (s) + Surf), respectively. The most active
catalyst used in this work, Ni/Al2O3, had the
highest proportion of NH2 groups detected on its surface
after the reaction (Figure 6) and the highest concentration of weak acid sites (Table 2); therefore, the
relationship between the proportion of NH2 and the concentration
of weak acid sites on the different catalyst surfaces was investigated
(Figure 11a). The
proportion of adsorbed NH2 increased as the concentration
of weak acid sites increased in the order: Ni/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Al2O3, which also follows
the order
of catalytic activity in ammonia production (Figure 3). These findings indicate that formation
of the NH2 intermediates was enhanced by the presence of
weak acid sites on the surface of the catalyst. The weak surface interactions
likely aided the migration of adsorbates across the catalyst surface
to active sites (e.g., M sites) to react via L-H mechanisms. Moreover,
the acid sites themselves probably functioned as active sites for
ammonia synthesis, as is evident from the activity of the Al2O3 support with plasma in the absence of transition metals.
The weaker surface interactions may have also enabled more facile
desorption of NH3 from the surface, which freed up surface
sites and provided faster turnover with fresh reactants. Indeed, the
strong acidity of oxide supports is known to be detrimental to the
performance for ammonia synthesis as this binds ammonia more robustly
to the surface.56 This argument is supported
by comparing the observed relationship between the proportion of adsorbed
NH3 vs. the concentration of medium + strong acid sites
on the catalyst surface (Figure 11b) with the catalyst performances. The proportion of
adsorbed NH3 increased with increasing concentration of
medium and strong acid sites (Table 2) in the order: Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Ni/Al2O3, whereas the catalyst activity decreased in
the order: Ni/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Al2O3. The stronger NH3 binds to the surface, the more
slowly
NH3 desorption from the surface occurs, which inhibits
the availability of active sites and slows the rate of ammonia synthesis.
Moreover, stronger binding of NH3 to the surface of the
catalyst increases its retention time in the plasma discharge area,
which increases the probability of plasma-catalytic degradation of
NH3 occurring, thus reducing yield and the apparent (measured)
rate of synthesis.

concentration of weak acid sites on M/Al2O3 surfaces

concentration of strong + medium acid sites on M/Al2O3 surfaces.

4.2 Enhancement
Mechanism of Ni/Al2O3
Optical emission
spectra of the N2–H2 DBD were measured
to better understand the
formation and role of gas-phase active species in the plasma-enhanced
synthesis of ammonia using different reactor configurations (Figure S9). The existence of N2 (C3Πu → B3Πg) second positive system (SPS) and weak band of N2 (B3Πg → A3Σu) first positive system (FPS)23 in the
spectra suggested the presence of electronically excited nitrogen
(R1: e + N2 → e + N2*, Table S5).23,57 The presence of N2+(B2Σu+ →
X2Πg+) first negative system
(FNS) indicates that the ionization of nitrogen (R2: e + N2 → e + N2+ + e) took place in the reaction.
Identification of N (3p2P0-3s2P)
atomic lines (674.0 nm) and Hα Balmer atomic line
(656.3 nm) suggests the dissociation of N2 and H2 (R3, R6).58 The NH band head at 336 nm
also could be identified as a shoulder peak beside N2 (0,
0) (Figure 12a).23

Figure 12 (a) Emission spectrum of NH, N2, N2+, and Hα for plasma only, packed with
Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 (exposure
time:
600 ms); (b) normalized relative intensity of N2+, N, Hα, and NH (SEI of 26.8 kJ L–1).

The normalized relative intensities
of N2+, N, Hα, and NH for plasma
only, and Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 packed configurations
are shown in Figure 12b (for the explanation on how the intensities were normalized, see Supporting Information section 9.2). The intensities
for N2+, N, Hα, and NH were
at relative maxima with the Ni/Al2O3 catalyst,
indicating that this configuration could promote the generation of
more excited species and radicals. The order of signal intensity for
the largest peak, N2+, was Ni/Al2O3 > Al2O3 > plasma only,
which
corresponds with the order of the mean electron energy values (Figures 12b and 8d)59 and increasing uniformity
of the plasma discharge (Figure 7). Similarly, there is a remarkable increase in the
intensity of the Hα atomic line with Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 packing, indicating
that more H atoms were generated, possibly due to the dissociation
of a greater portion of H2 molecules with increasing the
mean electron energy (Figures 12b and 8). Furthermore, when
comparing the spectra of the different packed catalysts, there were
notable variations in the intensity of the NH band head at 336 nm
with changes in the N2+, N and Hα signal strengths. Both N2+ and NH signal intensities
were higher in the Ni/Al2O3 spectrum than those
in the plasma only and Al2O3 spectra, while
the intensities of the N and Hα peak signals followed
the orders Ni/Al2O3 > plasma only > Al2O3 and Ni/Al2O3 ≈
Al2O3 > plasma only, respectively. These
results suggest
that more NH was produced with Ni/Al2O3 due
to higher ratios of N2+, N and H formed in the
plasma discharge. Indeed, it has been proposed in previous works that
NH radicals are generated from these species in the plasma.60−62 Moreover, Hong et al. found that NH radicals are a critical species
in the initiation and acceleration of ammonia synthesis. They are
important in the gas-phase generation of NH3 in the plasma
and are involved in three-body reactions (R19–R22) with N2 and H2 molecules.61 The more NH radicals that are involved in these reactions, the faster
the production of ammonia in the gas phase.

As discussed previously,
NH2(s) has been identified
in other works as an important species in the formation of ammonia,
which itself is formed through the gas-phase and surface-adsorbed
NH species through E-R and L-H reactions, respectively. The higher
concentration of NH radicals produced in the plasma with Ni/Al2O3 may, therefore, contribute to the improved yield
and synthesis rate of ammonia by increasing the concentration of NH2(s).

Wang et al. stated that the dissociative adsorption
of NH3 on the catalyst surface (S20–S22) would occur
more easily
with a stronger M-N bond.63 An indication
of the relative strength of the M-N (M: metal, including Fe, Ni, Cu)
bond for the different catalysts used in this work was determined
by Tonset, measured by N2-TPD,
which increased in the order: Ni-N < Cu-N < Fe-N. The observed
order in ammonia yield with M/Al2O3 catalysts,
Ni/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 >
Fe/Al2O3, is in line with decreasing M-N bond
strength, which suggests that the improved yield with Ni/Al2O3 may have resulted from a lower rate of ammonia dissociation
due to weaker M-N bonding. These results are in agreement with those
obtained by Mehta et al., who also found that ammonia yields were
improved with weaker nitrogen binding energies on the active metal
sites.13 By combining experiments with
DFT microkinetic modeling, they determined that metals with a lower
nitrogen binding strength have smaller hydrogenation barriers, which
consequently leads to considerable rate enhancements. In agreement
with this work, Ni/Al2O3 was identified as one
of the best catalysts, while the performance of Fe/Al2O3 was relatively poor, indicating that the improved performance
of Ni/Al2O3 over the other catalysts used in
this work could be attributed to its smaller hydrogenation barriers.

It was proposed by Hong et al. that catalyst metal sites have a
higher reaction coefficient for the dissociative adsorption of N2 and H2 (eqs S16–S19) than Al2O3,61 and that the diffusion
energy barrier (Ed) of L-H reactions (eqs
S12–S15) on metal sites (0.2 eV) could be lower than that on
Al2O3 surface sites (0.5 eV).64 The inclusion of surface metal sites could, therefore,
accelerate the diffusion of N2(s) and H2(s)
and further promote the generation of NHx(s) species for ammonia synthesis. The more homogeneous dispersion
of the transition metal particles on the surface of Ni/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 (see HRTEM images, Figure 1) may have provided
a more uniform dispersion of N2(s) and H2(s)
across the catalyst surface, contributing to their improved performance
compared with Fe/Al2O3. In addition to this,
the Ni and Cu metal species were also smaller and had more uniform
particle size distributions than the Fe species, and these properties
have been reported to aid plasma-activated surface reactions.65

As shown in Figure 5, a comparison of the NH3-TPD
profiles for the fresh and
spent Ni/Al2O3 catalysts indicated that more
NH3 desorbed from the spent catalyst at lower temperatures,
signifying a reduction in the number of medium + strong acid sites.
The change in acid sites may indicate that the interaction between
the catalyst and the plasma during the reaction improved desorption
of ammonia by altering the catalyst surface. As previously discussed,
the easier NH3 desorbs from the surface, the less likely
it is to dissociate on the catalyst surface, which means these modifications
likely improved the ammonia synthesis rate and yield.

Based
on the results discussed in this work, a schematic diagram
showing the possible mechanisms for ammonia synthesis by plasma-catalysis
with Ni/Al2O3 is presented in Scheme 2. Ammonia synthesis by gas-phase
reactions occurs through pathways that involve N, H, N2, H2, N2*, H2*, and NHx (x = 1, 2) species (eqs R3, R14,
R15, and R17–R22). In packing the discharge area with Al2O3 or M/Al2O3, the heterogeneous
reactions become the dominant pathways (eqs S1–S19) and the
ammonia yields are significantly improved. This phenomenon can be
evidenced by the negligible effect of different metal catalysts (M/Al2O3) on the physical characteristics of the discharge
in the plasma-catalytic synthesis of ammonia. In the presence of Ni/Al2O3, both gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions
could be enhanced by significant alterations in the discharge, and
through the adsorption, dissociation and surface reaction pathways
provided by Ni. Ni/Al2O3 could produce more
radicals (e.g., N, H, and NH) in the gas-phase by enhancing the reduced
electric field and could also promote surface reactions by generating
more NHx through stepwise hydrogenation
via the L-H mechanism

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism for the Enhancement of
Ammonia Synthesis by Ni/Al2O3 Catalyst
5 Conclusions
Plasma-enhanced
synthesis of ammonia using transition metal catalysts
(M/Al2O3, M= Fe, Ni, Cu) has been achieved at
ambient pressure and near room temperature with a water-electrode
DBD reactor. Compared to plasma synthesis of NH3 without
a catalyst, plasma-catalysis significantly enhanced the NH3 synthesis rate and energy efficiency, which increased with different
catalysts in the order: Ni/Al2O3 > Cu/Al2O3 > Fe/Al2O3 > Al2O3. All of the catalysts provided stable performances
for at least 6 h, and Ni/Al2O3 maintained an
efficient performance when recycled five times. The highest NH3 synthesis rate of 471 μmol g–1 h–1 was achieved with Ni/Al2O3,
which was 100% higher than that of plasma only. The performance was
moderate compared to the state of the art. As there were no notable
differences in the discharge characteristics for the three different
metal catalysts, these results suggest that the catalytic effects
provided by the chemistry of the catalyst surface are dominant over
the physical effects of the catalysts in the plasma-catalytic synthesis
of ammonia.

Most importantly, an insight into the synergetic
effects of plasma-catalytic
synthesis of ammonia at near-room temperature and atmospheric pressure
has been investigated via a series of characterization methods. This
indicates that the weak acid sites of the Al2O3 support can influence the performance of M/Al2O3 catalysts in the plasma-catalyzed synthesis of NH3. Ni/Al2O3 produced a more uniform plasma discharge than
Al2O3 or plasma only that enhanced both the
gas-phase radical reactions of N, H and NH in the plasma and the reactions
on the surface of the catalyst. The surface acidity of Ni/Al2O3 was also altered during the reaction, reducing the
number of medium and strong acid sites, which may have also improved
the rate of ammonia synthesis in situ. Furthermore, the synergy is
also reflected in the order of the M-N bond strength (Ni-N < Cu-N
< Fe-N); the weakest M-N bonds are expected to inhibit ammonia
decomposition and enhance the turnover frequency for ammonia synthesis
by reducing the energy required to dissociate ammonia from the metal
sites on the catalyst surface.
