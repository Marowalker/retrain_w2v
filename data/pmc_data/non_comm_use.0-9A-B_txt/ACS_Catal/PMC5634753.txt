The
photoactivity of methanol adsorbed on the anatase TiO2 (101)
surface was studied by a combination of scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
Isolated methanol molecules adsorbed at the anatase (101) surface
show a negligible photoactivity. Two ways of methanol activation were
found. First, methoxy groups formed by reaction of methanol with coadsorbed
O2 molecules or terminal OH groups are photoactive, and
they turn into formaldehyde upon UV illumination. The methoxy species
show an unusual C 1s core-level shift of 1.4 eV compared to methanol;
their chemical assignment was verified by DFT calculations with inclusion
of final-state effects. The second way of methanol activation opens
at methanol coverages above 0.5 monolayer (ML), and methyl formate
is produced in this reaction pathway. The adsorption of methanol in
the coverage regime from 0 to 2 ML is described in detail; it is key
for understanding the photocatalytic behavior at high coverages. There,
a hydrogen-bonding network is established in the adsorbed methanol
layer, and consequently, methanol dissociation becomes energetically
more favorable. DFT calculations show that dissociation of the methanol
molecule is always the key requirement for hole transfer from the
substrate to the adsorbed methanol. We show that the hydrogen-bonding
network established in the methanol layer dramatically changes the
kinetics of proton transfer during the photoreaction.

Introduction
Photocatalysis is currently
at the center of scientific interest
as a potential route to efficient light harvesting for the production
of transportable fuels.1−3 However, transfer of photocatalysis into applications
is hampered by the low quantum efficiency of the whole process, which
typically does not exceed 10%. The detailed mechanisms leading to
efficient photocatalytic reactions are still a subject of an intensive
debate, despite more than 40 years of research in the field.4

TiO2 is a prototypical photocatalytic
material. It crystallizes
in two main forms, rutile and anatase,5 where the metastable anatase is often considered more photoactive.6 Methanol is a molecule representing a class of
simple organic molecules, which bind via their oxygen atom in a monodentate
configuration. As a model system, methanol on TiO2 has
thus attracted significant attention from both experiment and theory
in the past decades.7−18 The experimental work mainly focused on the rutile (110) surface,
though. It has been demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM) that isolated methanol19 (or water)16 molecules adsorbed on TiO2 rutile
(110) can be split by UV light. Coverage-dependent investigations
on the rutile (110) surface showed that the photoactivity of methanol
decreases with an increasing coverage.20 (This behavior is opposite to the results on anatase, presented
in this work.) It was further reported that the formation of methoxy
species significantly increases the photocatalytic activity.8 Methoxy groups on the rutile TiO2 (110)
have been previously obtained either by direct reaction of methanol
with surface oxygen vacancies9 or by reaction
of methanol with coadsorbed oxygen.7,8

Here
we investigate the mechanisms of methanol photoactivation
on anatase TiO2 (101), which is the most typical surface
found in commercial catalysts. Unlike the well-studied rutile (110)
surface,5 anatase (101) does not contain
surface oxygen vacancies (VOs),21−23 which prevents
bond cleavage within the methanol molecule from direct interaction
with the highly reactive VOs. This makes the surface chemistry
on anatase (101) closer to real photocatalytic conditions, since the
surface VOs are not expected to exist outside ultrahigh
vacuum (UHV).

We first analyze in detail the adsorption of methanol
in the coverage
regime from 0 to 2 monolayers (ML), which is the key for understanding
its photocatalytic reactions. Next we show that single, isolated methanol
molecules show only negligible photocatalytic activity. Our calculations
indicate that the main impediment for photooxidation of methanol lies
in the hole transfer from the substrate: Methanol must first dissociate
(form a methoxy group), and only then the hole transfer becomes energetically
favorable. We achieved the dissociation either by reactions with external
species coadsorbed at the surface (O2 molecules or terminal
OH groups) or by intramolecular interactions in the methanol layer,
which occur at higher coverages. The first mechanism (reaction with
O2) has been previously reported on the rutile (110) surface.7,8 The second mechanism is closely related to hydrogen bonding between
methanol molecules. It is known that hydrogen bonding plays a significant
role in biological systems,24,25 catalytic reactions,26 and possibly also in photocatalysis.27 Here we show that the hydrogen bonding between
methanol molecules can alter the energy balance for thermal dissociation
of the molecule and, consequently, change the energy balance for hole
transfer onto the molecule and activate the molecule for photocatalysis.

In this work, we use scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to observe
photocatalytic processes at the atomic scale. STM is an excellent
tool for direct observation of species and photoinduced changes, but
its main disadvantage is the lack of chemical sensitivity. For unambiguous
chemical identification of the adsorbed species, we use area-averaging
spectroscopic techniques: X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Density functional theory
(DFT) calculations provide detailed insights into the reaction pathways
and mechanisms. We also calculate and discuss XPS core-level shifts
of the methanol and methoxy C 1s peaks, because the experimentally
observed chemical shift between these two species is significantly
higher than observed on other oxide surfaces.

Experimental and Computational
Details
STM measurements were performed at T = 6 K or T = 80 K in a UHV chamber with a base
pressure below 1 ×
10–11 mbar, equipped with a commercial Omicron LT-STM
head. Controlled low-temperature annealing of the sample was performed
in a manipulator cooled by flowing nitrogen gas. The temperature was
measured by a K-type thermocouple attached to the sample holder. We
estimate that the quoted temperatures are accurate within ±10
K. Electrochemically etched W STM tips were cleaned by sputtering
or self-sputtering28 in Ar and treated
on a Cu (100) or Au (110) surface to obtain a reproducible, metallic
tip condition. We used a single-crystalline mineral anatase TiO2(101) sample, naturally doped by 1% Nb.23 The surface was prepared by ex-situ cleaving or polishing
(both types were used) and subsequent cleaning in vacuum by cycles
of Ar+ sputtering (1 keV) and annealing to 950 K.29 A Hg discharge lamp (Oriel Instruments) was
used for illuminating the surface by UV light. The incident photon
flux was 1.3 × 1016 cm–2s–1. The light was introduced to the UHV chamber via a quartz window
into the STM cryostat. The sample temperature during the illumination
was below 20 K for measurements performed at LHe temperature, and
81 K for measurements performed at LN2 temperature. The
tip was retracted by ∼100 μm during the UV irradiation.

The TPD measurements were performed in a separate UHV system30 with a base pressure of 5 × 10–11 mbar using a HIDEN quadrupole mass spectrometer in a line-of-sight
configuration. Here the anatase sample was mounted on a Ta back plate,
cooled by a Janis ST-400 UHV liquid He flow cryostat, and heated by
direct current through the back plate. The temperature was measured
by a K-type thermocouple spot-welded to the sample plate, and calibrated
using multilayer desorption of several gases (O2, H2O, CO). The resulting uncertainty in the absolute temperature
reading is estimated to be ±3 K (increasing up to ±10 K
at temperatures below ∼40 K). During the TPD measurements,
the sample was biased at −100 V to prevent electrons from the
quadrupole‘s filament reaching the sample surface. Gases were
dosed by an effusive molecular beam with a hat-shape profile.30,31 This produces a beam spot of ≈3.5 mm diameter at the sample
(sample size 4 × 6 mm2) and also allows us to determine
the gas dose with an accuracy better than 10%. One monolayer (ML)
of methanol corresponds to a dosage of 1.6 Langmuir (L) (taking into
account the measured sticking coefficient of 0.85). Only the TiO2(101) surface was exposed to the molecular beam. The dose
rate under these conditions is approximately 1.2 ML/min. For the TPD
measurements a linear temperature ramp of 1 K/s was used.

XPS
spectra were measured in the same vacuum system with a hemispherical
electrostatic energy analyzer (SPECS Phoibos 150), using a monochromatized
Al Kα X-ray source (SPECS Focus 500). Data were recorded at
a sample temperature of T = 34 K. Any influence of
the X-rays and contamination from the residual gas was carefully checked
by TPD spectra recorded after the XPS data were taken; no radiation-induced
damage was observed. XPS was measured under a 60° exit angle
off normal.

Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed within
the plane-wave
pseudopotential scheme as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO package.32 We used the generalized gradient approximation
of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)33 with
the addition of on-site Hubbard U repulsion34 on the Ti 3d orbitals. We took U = 3.9 eV, as given by cRPA calculations.35 Electron–ion interactions were described using ultrasoft
pseudopotentials.36 We expanded the electronic
states in plane waves using a kinetic-energy cutoff of 25.0 (200.0)
Ry for the smooth part of the wave function (augmented charge density).
The anatase (101) surface was modeled using a repeated-slab geometry
with lattice parameters optimized at the PBE level and a vacuum width
of 18 Å between adjacent slabs. We considered a slab of 3 TiO2 trilayers, with various rectangular surface supercells, notably
(1 × 2), corresponding to a surface area of 10.21 × 7.55
Å2, (1 × 3), and (1 × 4). In all cases,
only the Γ-point was used to sample the Brillouin zone. Structural
optimizations were performed relaxing all atomic positions until residual
forces were smaller than 0.05 eV/Å. Energy barriers between different
adsorption structures were estimated using the nudged-elastic band
(NEB) method,37 and pathways were relaxed
until forces converged below 0.05 eV/Å. Constant-density (10–5 electrons per bohr3) STM images were calculated
by integrating the local density of states in an energy window of
∼2.5 eV from the conduction band minimum.

Reaction pathways
in the presence of a photoexcited hole were investigated
by means of the CRYSTAL06 package38 where
the Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in Gaussian type orbitals
(the all-electron basis sets are O 8–411(d1), Ti 86–411
(d41), H 311(p1), C 6-311(d11)). The hybrid B3LYP functional39−41 was employed. We modeled the anatase (101) TiO2 surface
using a slab of three triatomic layers with 72 atoms and (1 ×
2) periodicity along the [101̅] and [010] directions corresponding
to a surface area 10.48 × 7.59 Å2; we did not
use periodic boundary condition in the direction perpendicular to
the surface. The k-space sampling for the geometry optimizations included
four k-points. Structural optimizations were performed relaxing all
atomic positions until residual forces were smaller than 0.012 eV/bohr.
In order to evaluate activation barriers along a reaction pathway,
we performed a series of constrained optimizations in which one internal
coordinate was kept fixed at different values, whereas the remaining
coordinates were fully relaxed until forces converged below 0.012
eV/bohr.

Results
Methanol Adsorption
We first discuss
in detail the
methanol adsorption configurations as a function of coverage. Figure 1a shows TPD spectra
in the coverage range from 0 to 2 ML (one monolayer
is defined as one molecule per a surface Ti5c atom). The
first-monolayer peak is broad, ranging from 200 to 330 K. It is followed
by a sharp double peak centered at temperatures of 157 to 180 K, which
contains another ∼0.5 ML of methanol. All methanol molecules
above 1.5 ML have the same desorption energy corresponding to multilayer
adsorption, causing the desorption peak at 127 K. When the anatase
surface was cleaned properly, no desorption peaks were detected above
330 K (sample cleanliness was verified by STM prior to inserting the
sample into the TPD chamber). This indicates that the previously reported
dissociation into methoxy42 at 620 K possibly
originated from dissociation at extrinsic defects. The TPD spectra
were analyzed by the inversion analysis technique, as described in
ref (43). We assumed
the first-order desorption mechanism with a coverage-dependent adsorption
energy and a constant frequency prefactor (thus neglecting entropic
contributions to desorption). Results are shown in Figure 1b. The best fits were obtained
for frequency prefactors ranging from 1014 to 1016 s–1, which is the range typically reported for
methanol.43−45

Adsorption of methanol on the
anatase (101) surface has been investigated
previously by TPD and XPS,46 and computationally
by DFT and molecular dynamics simulations.47 The results indicated that the amount of methanol in the first layer
is above 1 ML, and the XPS data of the O 1s peak indicated that hydrogen
bonding plays an important role in the first layer. We have repeated
all calculations using thicker slabs and different, that is, (1 ×
2), (1 × 3), and (1 × 4), surface supercells, considering
also the effect of donor dopants (subsurface Nb) and comparing the
results of pure PBE and PBE+U calculations. Results of a representative
set of PBE+U calculations are shown in Figure 2; these are coverage-dependent
adsorption configurations obtained using a (1 × 2) surface supercell,
so that 1 ML corresponds to four molecules per DFT unit cell, one
molecule per surface Ti atom.

Figure 2 Calculated adsorption configurations of methanol
at different coverages.
The top row shows the most favorable adsorption configuration found
at each coverage. The adsorption weakens with increasing coverage; Eads is the average adsorption energy per molecule,
while the numbers in brackets denote the adsorption energy of the
last molecule added to the slab (relevant for comparison with the
TPD results in Figure 1). The second row shows selected alternative (less favorable) adsorption
configurations. The last row shows a dissociated methanol molecule
(energetically unfavorable except for 1.5 ML); note that dissociation
becomes energetically more favorable with increasing coverage.

At low coverages, the methanol
molecule binds with its O atom to
a surface Ti5c atom, and forms an additional weak hydrogen
bond (2.48 Å length) to the surface O2c atom (see Figure 2a). For two molecules
per DFT supercell (0.5 ML, Figure 2b), the most favorable adsorption configuration still
consists of two molecules in the original monodentate configuration.
However, the adsorption energy is almost identical to that of an alternative
configuration, where one of the molecules is bound via two hydrogen
bonds—one toward the surface, and one toward the neighboring
methanol molecule (strong H bonds, 1.54–1.58 Å). At one
monolayer (Figure 2c), the most favorable adsorption configuration has two molecules
bound to the surface Ti5c atoms, plus two molecules bound
only via H-bonds. This configuration is more favorable than binding
all molecules to the surface Ti5c atoms. Up to 1 ML, the
adsorption energy changes only slightly with coverage; this is in
agreement with TPD measurements, where a single broad peak is detected.
Adsorption of 1.5 ML results in filling the remaining Ti5c sites, though the adsorption is significantly weaker–the
energy gain when adding the last two molecules is only 0.48 eV per
molecule, much less than the adsorption energy in the first monolayer
(0.70 to 0.74 eV). This again agrees with the TPD data, where we observe
distinct peaks in the range from 1 to 1.5 ML. Further increase of
the coverage above 1.5 ML (see Figure 2e) results in adsorption in the second layer, where
the additional molecules are only weakly bound, with an energy corresponding
to 0.24 eV. This again shows an excellent agreement with the TPD data.

It is important to note that methanol dissociation becomes increasingly
favorable with increasing coverage—see the bottom row in Figure 2. For a single molecule,
the dissociated state is 0.21 eV less favorable than the molecular
adsorption. At higher coverages, the energy cost for dissociation
decreases. This effect is associated with formation of a hydrogen-bond
network in the layer. The presence of hydrogen bonds is in agreement
with previous XPS data;46 here the O 1s
peak of the methanol molecule shifts toward lower binding energies
at coverages above 0.5 ML, which is a characteristic feature associated
with H-bond donation into these atoms.48

Calculations performed on larger slabs or in the presence
of dopants
show small quantitative differences from the values in Figure 2, while the qualitative behavior
is already fully described by the (1 × 2) cell. We note that
the increased tendency for dissociation into methoxy species with
the coverage is opposite to the behavior reported on the rutile (110)
surface.49

Photoactivity of Isolated
Methanol Molecules
We first
examine the photoactivity of adsorbed methanol molecules in the dilute
coverage limit (see Figure 3). In STM images, the molecule appears as a single, bright
spot centered near a Ti5c atom (inset in Figure 3a), with a typical apparent
height of ∼120 pm. This is in agreement with the calculated
adsorption configuration in Figure 2a. We have exposed the adsorbed methanol molecules
to high doses of UV light. Figure 1a,b shows the same area before and after 70 min UV
irradiation. No change is noticeable; the molecules are essentially
“photoblind”. Hole transfer to isolated undissociated
methanol molecules is not favored and was not observed in our calculations.
This will be further discussed later in the manuscript, where low-
and high-coverage results will be compared.

of surface Ti5c atoms are marked. (b) The same area after
70 min of UV irradiation. The methanol molecules do not undergo any
changes.

Reaction with Terminal
(OH)− Groups
It is known from previous
studies that the photoactivity of methanol
increases after partial dissociation into a methoxy group; on the
rutile (110) surface, this was typically achieved by reacting it with
coadsorbed oxygen8 or by reaction with
oxygen vacancies.9 In the case of the anatase
(101) surface, O2 adsorption is a complex process with
multiple adsorption configurations.23,50−52 In order to simplify the reaction process, here we consider terminal
(OH)− groups (i.e., OH groups bound to surface Ti5c atoms) instead of adsorbed O2. Results for the
reaction with O2 are essentially identical (see Figures S1–S3). Reaction of methanol with
terminal (OH)− groups is imaged step-by-step by
STM in Figure 4. DFT
results for the same reaction sequence are shown in Figure 5. Chemical identification of
all the species is confirmed by XPS in Figure 6.

anatase (101) surface,
measured at T = 6 K: (a) Surface with terminal (OH)− groups, prepared according to ref (53). (b) Methoxy (CH3O)− groups. The inset shows a zoom-in of two methoxy
species. (c) The same area as in (b), after 30 min UV irradiation.
The methoxy groups are partly converted to formaldehyde and H+. (d) Annealing to 280 K results in desorption of the formaldehyde;
single H atoms are found at the surface. Dots in the insets mark approximate
positions of surface Ti5c atoms.

Figure 5 Reaction mechanism for the photoconversion of methanol to formaldehyde,
obtained from B3LYP calculations. In step (a) → (b), methanol
reacts with a terminal OH– group, which results
in methoxy (CH3O) –. This step is thermally
activated. In (b) → (c), the methoxy accepts a hole, and a
methoxy radical is formed. In (c) → (d), the methoxy radical
is converted to formaldehyde and the excess hydrogen is transferred
to the surface. (e) Adsorption geometry of the formaldehyde after
hole-quenching of the excess electron coming from the neighboring
bridging OH group. The extra hydrogen atom in (a) and (b) were included
for computational purposes to maintain the cell neutrality.

steps of photoconversion of methanol to formaldehyde. (a) C 1s, (b)
O 1s, (c) Ti 2p3/2 peaks. Gray curves show a clean surface;
red curves a surface exposed to 0.8 L (0.5 ML) methanol; blue curves
a surface containing methoxy groups (created via thermal reaction
with terminal OH– groups); black curves show the
methoxy groups after 30 min of UV irradiation (C 1s region magnified
3×).

Figure 4a shows
a surface with terminal (OH)− groups. Previously
we have reported that the reaction between O2 and H2O coadsorbed on the anatase (101) surface results in the formation
of these (OH)− species, which are the only reaction
product, and stable at room temperature.53 These species likely are present under realistic catalytic conditions,
even though water molecules do not spontaneously dissociate on anatase.54 Water dissociation becomes possible via reaction
with activated (O2)−, where the excess
electrons for oxygen activation55 either
originate from sample doping (intrinsic/extrinsic), or from photoirradiation.
The surface shown in Figure 4a was prepared by the same procedure as in ref (53), i.e., codosing O2 and H2O at 100 K and annealing to room temperature
for 10 min. This results in terminal (OH)−; the
concentration is determined by availability of excess electrons, here
provided by Nb doping. This surface was then exposed to 2 L (Langmuir)
of methanol at T = 110 K. The corresponding STM image
is shown in the inset between Figure 4a,b; only fuzzy images were obtained, which we attribute
to mobility of the molecules weakly bound by a hydrogen-bonding network.
It is indeed known that an STM tunneling current can easily switch
hydrogen bonds,56,57 and thus, higher coverages of
methanol appear unstable in STM images. Annealing such a surface to
room temperature results in the reaction between coadsorbed (OH)− and methanol (see Figure 4b). The proton from the methanol’s
OH group is transferred to the terminal (OH)−, forming
water and a methoxy anion CH3O–. 1  

The methoxy species (Figure 4b) appear as dimer-like protrusions with an apparent
height
of ∼60 pm, slightly higher than the (OH)− species (typically ∼20 pm). The substrate around the methoxy
species appears slightly darker in STM images, which is an indication
for upward band-bending induced by the negative charge localized at
the methoxy group.58 The second reaction
product (i.e., water) is not present here, as it desorbs during prolonged
annealing to 300 K, together with all unreacted methanol molecules
(see the TPD results in Figure 1a).

The methoxy groups exhibit high photosensitivity. Figure 4c shows the surface
after 30
min of UV irradiation (the same region as Figure 4b). Many of the methoxy groups change their
appearance; their apparent height increases significantly (to ∼180
pm), and this new feature appears as a dimer, slightly rotated with
respect to the Ti rows. We note that the STM images of the methoxy
groups (Figure 4b)
are very similar to the original terminal OH– groups
(Figure 4a); the major
difference lies in their interaction with UV light. The isolated OH– groups appear photoblind; they do not exhibit any
change when exposed to UV light.

We considered various reaction
pathways, and the best sequence
is shown in Figure 5. The first step (a → b) is thermally activated: methanol
is converted into a methoxy group (CH3O–) through interaction with a terminal OH– group.
This provides a slight energy gain of 0.11 eV, as the OH group has
a higher proton affinity than the methoxy group. We note here that
the key prerequisite for the methoxy formation is the presence of
excess charge in the substrate (provided by extrinsic Nb doping in
our experiments); the terminal OH– group would not
form without an excess electron, and the reaction 1 could not happen. In the second step, the
methoxy group accepts a hole (Figure 5, step b → c), forming a methoxy radical CH3O•. One H from the methyl group is hydrogen-bonded
to the surface O2c atom. The radical then decomposes into
formaldehyde, and this H is transferred to the surface, forming a
bridging OH group (Figure 5d). Experimentally we observe two orientations of the formaldehyde
molecule (Figure 4c,
with a detail in the inset), which we attribute to the fact that there
are two possible sites for dropping the H atom at the surface. The
STM images of formaldehyde in Figure 4c agree with STM images we obtained in a separate study
of formaldehyde adsorption on the anatase (101) surface (apparent
height of 160–180 pm).59

Figure 4d shows
an STM image after further annealing to 280 K for 10 min. Here the
formaldehyde molecules have desorbed,59 and we observe single H atoms at the surface. We ascertained this
observation by investigating the adsorption of atomic H on anatase
(101) in detail (unpublished results, partially shown in the supplementary Figure S4). We identified the H
atoms in Figure 4d
from their appearance in STM images60 and
by tip-induced manipulations. In addition to the hydrogen, Figure 4d shows methoxy groups,
which have not reacted under UV irradiation, as well as a few other
species, which are not clearly identified.

Identification of the Species
by XPS
While STM imaging
is a powerful tool to observe processes directly at the atomic scale,
the method provides very limited chemical information. All the species
discussed in this work appear dimer-like close to the position of
the surface Ti5c atoms, with subtle differences occurring mostly in
the apparent height of the features. Typical apparent heights are
∼20 pm for OH– groups, ∼60 pm for
(CH3O)−, ∼120 pm for methanol,
and ∼180 pm for formaldehyde. Typical experimental STM images,
line profiles, and calculated STM images of these species are shown
in Figure S5. These differences allow us
to distinguish different species when they are present together in
one STM image, and enable detection of the key photoinduced reaction
steps. However, unambiguous chemical identification of the adsorbed
species requires spectroscopic techniques. To this end, we have used
XPS and TPD. We trace the identical reaction, as described in Figure 4. In order to minimize
beam damage and sample contamination, the surface was freshly prepared
after each XPS measurement.

The XPS results are summarized in Figure 6, which shows the
C 1s, O 1s, and Ti 2p regions. The reference spectra obtained on the
clean surface, free of any contamination and close to the stoichiometric
condition, are shown in gray. The red spectra were measured after
the surface was exposed to 0.8 L of methanol. The C 1s peak is located
at a binding energy of 287.6 eV, close to the value reported for methanol
on TiO2 rutile (110) and (001) surfaces.14,61,62 Methoxy was prepared by an identical procedure
as described in the context of Figure 4b, and the resulting spectra are shown in blue. The
C 1s spectrum shows a distinct peak at 286.2 eV, which we attribute
to the methoxy species. Compared to the molecular methanol, the methoxy
C 1s peak is shifted by 1.4 eV to lower binding energies. The typical
shift between methanol and methoxy species adsorbed on oxide surfaces
is only 0.4 to 0.6 eV,63−67 and rarely approaches 1.0 eV.68,69 The shift observed
here is considerably higher, yet not strong enough to attribute this
peak to a different oxidation state of carbon.

In order to verify
our assignment of the species in XPS, we performed
DFT calculations of the core-level shifts with inclusion of the final-state
effect;70 see details in Figure S6. We tested our setup on methanol/methoxy adsorbed
on the rutile (110) surface, and we obtained C 1s core-level shifts
of 0.25 to 0.6 eV (depending on the details of the computational model),
while typical experimental values are ∼0.6 eV.14 The calculations performed on anatase provide significantly
higher core-level shifts of 0.88 to 1.13 eV. When comparing these
values to the experiment, it is necessary to further add the upward
band-bending induced by the negatively charged methoxy species. The
band bending is apparent in the O 1s and Ti 2p core levels (Figure 6b,c) and amounts
to 0.2 eV. Taking this into account, the calculated core-level shifts
show an excellent agreement with the experiment. The larger core-level
shift on anatase originates from the absence of an H bond between
the O atom of the methoxy group and the dissociated proton. On other
substrates the methanol dissociates, but there remains a hydrogen
bond, which affects the electron distribution and results in different
screening of the core-hole. The large shift in C 1s observed on anatase
is therefore a final-state effect. In the initial-state model, the
difference in calculated core-level shifts between methanol and methoxy
on anatase was only 0.22 eV.

The black curves in Figure 6 were measured after UV illumination
of the methoxy species.
Now the C 1s spectrum shows three peaks of similar intensity. The
peak at 289.2 eV corresponds to formaldehyde.59,71 The XPS spectrum after UV illumination contains two other peaks,
located at 286.9 and 284.7 eV. The peak at 286.9 eV can be attributed
to unreacted methoxy groups. It is known that the formaldehyde produced
during the photoreaction can couple to methoxy groups and form methyl
formate (CH3–O–CHO).10,14 The third C peak at 284.7 eV could possibly originate from the methyl
group of the methyl formate.72

The
O 1s and Ti 3p peaks in Figures 6b,c show that formation of OH– and
CH3O– leads to upward band bending (≈0.2
eV), and the UV light completely removes the band-bending induced
by the methoxy species. This is partially caused by neutralization
of the negatively charged methoxy species by UV-generated holes. Further,
the photoreaction produces hydrogen atoms bound to surface O2c atoms (so-called bridging hydroxyl groups). These act as electron
donors5 in TiO2 and can thus
contribute to the reduction of the band-bending. The presence of the
bridging hydroxyls is indicated by the small shoulder on the high-binding
energy side of the O 1s peak (Figure 6b), supporting the assignment of the species in the
STM image in Figure 4d.

TPD Results
In order to test the reaction schemes proposed
above and add quantitative information, we have investigated the photo-oxidation
of methanol by TPD. Here we show results for both ways of methanol
activation: via reaction with terminal OH groups and with O2. In the case of methanol + O2, isotopically labeled 18O2 was used. This suppresses the background signal
and allows us to identify water originating from the reaction. Terminal
OH groups were prepared by dosing 0.2 L 18O2 at 55 K, followed by dosing 1 L of H216O and
short annealing to 350 K. This should provide normal and isotopically
labeled 16OH and 18OH groups in a ∼ 1:1
ratio.

The TPD results are reported in Figure 7. The water signal coming from the reaction
is shown in Figure 7a. We have plotted the signal of isotopically labeled water, m/z = 20, as it is not affected by the
background signal. In the case of the reaction of methanol + 18O2, a sharp desorption peak of labeled water is
observed at T = 260 K. This is the same temperature
that is observed for H2O desorption from a clean surface,46 indicating that the whole reaction is completed
below this temperature. For the case of OH reaction with methanol,
the H218O peak is smaller, with a pronounced
shoulder extending up to 400 K. We attribute the lower peak height
to the fact that only half of the terminal OH groups is isotopically
labeled. The shoulder indicates that the reaction 1 requires higher activation energy than the
O2-mediated version.

Figure 7 TPD spectra. (a) Signal of isotopically
labeled water measured
after codosing 0.5 ML methanol with terminal OH groups, or with 18O2. Here the terminal OH groups were obtained
by codosing 0.5 ML H216O with 0.5 ML 18O2 and annealing to 350 K. (b) CHO+ signal
measured during the same reaction. (c) Formaldehyde signal measured
after illuminating the methoxy groups (created via the reaction with
terminal OH groups) by UV light for 15 min at T =
100 K.

The TPD spectra of the methoxy
groups are shown in Figure 7b where m/z = 29 is plotted
(methoxy desorbs as methanol and formaldehyde
via a disproportiation reaction;7m/z = 29 is a cracking product from both
of these). The peak at 290 K corresponds to a cracking product from
desorbing, unreacted methanol (the cracking pattern of this peak matches
the cracking pattern of methanol, see Table S2). The methoxy peak is found at 615 K. The peak heights are comparable
for both pathways of methoxy formation, via activation with O2 and OH, which indicates that the efficiency of the methoxy
formation is similar in both cases. The reaction with O2 has a more complex pathway and is discussed in detail in the Supporting Information.

Figure 7c shows
TPD traces of formaldehyde (the main cracking products are m/z = 29 and 30) after illuminating the
methoxy by UV light. Here the methoxy was created via the reaction
with terminal OH– groups. The peak at 250 K corresponds
to desorption of formaldehyde59 (highest
sensitivity for m/z = 29), while
the peak at 310 K corresponds to methanol. We attribute the methanol
desorption to a recombinative reaction between the methoxy that was
not converted by the UV light, and the hydrogen produced during the
methoxy photodecomposition. We can exclude that the methanol peak
in Figure 7c would
originate from background methanol pressure or from methanol remaining
from the methoxy-creation step, as the methanol was dosed through
the molecular beam only on the sample area. We also detect a tiny
peak at mass m/z = 60 at 290 K,
which was previously attributed to the methyl formate production;10,73 in this particular photoreaction, it is only a minor product.

Photoactivity of Methanol at High Coverages
Using STM,
we have shown that isolated methanol molecules are not photoactive
(Figure 3). However,
we have found that dosing higher coverages of methanol and illuminating
the surface by UV light results in production of methyl formate; see
the TPD results in Figure 8a. While no methyl formate was detected for methanol coverages
below 0.5 ML, the amount of methyl formate measured in TPD grows rapidly
in the coverage range between 0.5 to 1.0 ML and then saturates. We
also evaluated the amount of methanol consumed in this photoreaction
(see Figure 8b). To
this end, we compared the amount of methanol dosed at the surface
with the amount of methanol desorbing from the surface after the UV
irradiation. (Here we used the TPD signal at m/z = 31, and we took into account an appropriate correction
stemming from the methyl formate cracking that contributes to the m/z = 31 trace.)

Figure 8 (a) TPD spectra of methyl
formate (m/z = 60) after dosing
various coverages of methanol and illuminating
the surface by UV light for 30 min at T = 120
K. The inset shows an integrated area of the m/z = 60 peak as a function of the methanol dosage. (b) The
amount of methanol consumed in the photoreaction, obtained from an
analysis of the TPD data at m/z =
31.

In the high-coverage regime, our
TPD data do not indicate the presence
of any other products such as formaldehyde, CO, or CO2 (further
analysis of our TPD results is shown in Figures S7 and S8 and in ref (74)). Previous studies on rutile and anatase report some formaldehyde
desorbing after small UV exposures.13,14 We did not
detect the corresponding TPD peak, possibly because of the much higher
UV doses used in this study. We note, however, that we detect H2O after the UV illumination (see Figure S8). Since H2O is not a reaction product of the
methanol → methyl formate reaction, this indicates that there
may be another reaction pathway in the high-coverage regime. Details
are discussed in the Supporting Information.

DFT Calculations of the (Photo)Reaction Kinetics
We
have shown that methanol can be activated by formation of methoxy
groups or dosing high coverages; these two ways lead to different
reaction products. Here we use DFT to explain the underlying mechanisms
and show that the kinetics of the hole transfer plays a key role.
First we discuss the simpler case of isolated CH3O– species and then move to the more complex situation
in the high-coverage regime.

A photocatalytic reaction is a
complex multistep event:1 (i) An electron–hole
pair is generated upon absorbing a UV photon in the TiO2. (ii) The hole is transported to the surface. (iii) The hole is
transferred from the TiO2 surface to the reacting species.
(iv) The adsorbed species undergo a redox reaction. All these steps
must proceed with a reasonable efficiency; the methoxy group outperforms
methanol in several aspects.

Compared to methanol, the first
advantage of the methoxy species
is its negative charge. This induces band-bending in the near-surface
region, resulting in an electric field inside the material, which
splits the electron–hole pairs. It reduces the recombination
probability and facilitates hole migration toward the surface. The
main advantage of the methoxy group, however, lies in point (iii),
i.e., the hole transfer between the substrate and the adsorbed species,
as discussed in previous theoretical studies.75 There is a substantial difference in the hole transfer to the methoxy
and methanol: while the transfer is energetically favorable for the
methoxy, an isolated adsorbed methanol molecule is not capable of
hole trapping because the presence of the proton bound to the O inhibits
the hole transfer.

The last step of the reaction is the hydrogen
transfer from the
methoxy radical to the surface, resulting in the formaldehyde. It
is important to consider that the relative stability of the methoxy
radical with respect to its negatively charged version (i.e., the
methoxy anion) largely depends on the availability of excess electrons
in the sample. Our experiments have all been conducted on a reduced
TiO2 sample, and thus, the methoxy → formaldehyde
reaction competes with the backward reaction of accepting an electron
from the substrate. We have estimated the energy barriers for the
forward and the backward reactions (see Figure 9). The calculated barrier for the formaldehyde
formation is 0.2 eV, while the energy barrier for the backward reaction
is estimated to be at least 0.6 eV. The high activation barrier for
the backward electron transfer largely originates from the significant
structural reorganization associated with this reaction. The calculated
bond length between the methoxy radical and the surface Ti5c is 2.15 Å (see Figure 4c), while for the methoxy anion it is only 1.80 Å (Figure 5b). This mechanism
makes the photocatalytic reaction robust against recombination.

Figure 9 Calculated
energy barriers for photoconversion of CH3O– (left) into formaldehyde (right). The CH3O– first accepts a hole, forming a methoxy
radical (middle). This can either covert into formaldehyde with an
energy barrier of 0.2 eV or accept an electron from the n-doped TiO2; the backward reaction is hindered by the
upward band bending and by an activation barrier. We consider that
excess electrons are present in the sample by having a Ti atom substituted
with a Nb atom, causing the presence of an extra electron (e–). The energies are based on PBE+U calculations,
except for the energy marked by asterisk, which is based on B3LYP.

The situation in the high-coverage
regime has quite different reaction
kinetics. The coverage-dependent structure of methanol (Figure 2) plays a key role in understanding
the qualitative change in the photoreaction; there is a qualitative
change above the coverage of 0.5 ML. Below 0.5 ML, methanol adsorbs
in a monodentate configuration with its O atom bound to the surface
Ti5c atom. Above 0.5 ML, there appears a different configuration
where the molecule is only bonded by two hydrogen bonds. We will only
focus on the first step of the photoreaction, that is, the hole transfer
into an adsorbed methanol molecule, which is a key obstacle in its
activation. The whole reaction pathway toward methyl formate is complex
and contains various activation barriers; it is beyond the scope of
this work.

We have investigated the process of hole transfer
into the various
adsorption configurations at 1.0 ML coverage (Figure 2c) by DFT calculations and compared the results
to those obtained at 0.25 ML coverage. Similar to the low-coverage
results, we find that hole transfer does not take
place for the lowest-energy adsorption configurations of Figure 2c, as hole transfer
is possible only when the methanol molecule is partially dissociated
(see Figure 10). The
dissociated state is still energetically unfavorable by +0.12 eV at
1.0 ML coverage (Figure 10c), although less than at low coverage, where the energy difference
is +0.21 eV (Figure 10a).

Figure 10 Schematic representation of methanol dissociation at low and high
coverages (0.25 and 1.0 ML). Results in (a) and (c) are obtained in
the absence of a photoexcited hole (PBE+U calculations),
whereas (b) and (d) include the presence of an excess hole (B3LYP
calculations).

In the presence of a
hole, the situation is reversed and the dissociated
state becomes energetically favored (Figure 10d). However, an analogous stabilization
is observed also at low coverage (Figure 10b). So the question is why photoreactivity
is only observed at high and not at low coverage? The reason is in
the kinetics of the proton transfer processes. The activation barrier
for proton transfer is as high as +0.44 eV for an isolated molecule,
whereas it is only +0.19 eV when 1.0 ML of methanol is present on
the surface (see Figure 10). Also, in the presence of the hydrogen-bonding network at
high methanol coverage, the proton transfer mechanism is different.
The proton is not directly transferred from the molecule to the surface
but is shuttled by a second methanol molecule through a concerted
pathway, which is kinetically less demanding. An easier proton transfer
facilitates the partial dissociation required for the hole transfer
and the subsequent photochemical steps. Analogous calculations in
the presence of a photoexcited hole in the low-coverage regime (0.25
ML) confirm that the proton transfer is the rate-determining step
also in this situation (Figure 10b) and yields an activation barrier of 1.29 eV.

The mechanism of methanol photoconversion into methyl formate (CH3–O–CHO) requires the removal of four protons.
Many reaction pathways are therefore conceivable, and the reaction
mechanism contains energy barriers. At the same time, we could not
access the details of the reaction by STM; our attempts for imaging
of high-coverage methanol layers only resulted in fuzzy images, as
shown for example in Figure 4, inset between panels a and b. We assume that the first hole
transfer enables generation of formaldehyde, which cross-couples to
methoxy groups that can easily form at methanol coverages above 0.5
ML due to thermally activated processes. A very interesting fact in
the high-coverage regime is that the photocatalytic methanol oxidation
was reported to produce H2 as a byproduct.13 In contrast, the reaction scheme using O2 or
OH– groups generates H2O due to the availability
of activated oxygen.

It is worth mentioning that the coverage
dependence of methanol
photocatalysis on the anatase (101) surface reported in this work
is exactly the opposite of that found on the rutile (110) surface.20 There it was reported that the methanol photoactivity drops above 0.67 ML; this effect was attributed to methanol
molecules hydrogen-bonded to surface bridging O2c atoms.20 Further, a computational study showed that the
energy balance for methanol dissociation on rutile turns in favor
of the undissociated configuration at higher coverages,49 again opposite to the anatase case. This strongly
indicates that the hydrogen-bonding network within the first monolayer
plays a key role in photocatalysis, and the exact arrangement of the
hydrogen bonds is determined by the surface structure.

Conclusions
We have studied adsorption of methanol on the anatase (101) surface
and its interaction with UV light. Isolated methanol molecules did
not show any changes even after high exposures of UV irradiation.
Two ways of methanol activation were identified: either via reaction
with coadsorbed oxygen or terminal OH– groups or
via dosing higher methanol coverages, above ≈0.5 ML. In the
first case, the photoreaction results in the production of formaldehyde
and water. In the latter case, methyl formate is produced; however,
small amounts of water are also observed, suggesting that additional
pathways may be present. In both scenarios, the key step for methanol
photoactivation is its partial dissociation, i.e., methoxy formation.
This is either obtained by transferring a proton to coadsorbed OH
or O2, or it becomes feasible at higher methanol coverages
where the kinetics of methanol dissociation is more favorable thanks
to a “shuttled” proton transfer mechanism. Finally,
it should be mentioned that identification of chemical species by
their XPS core level shifts can be less straightforward than often
assumed. Even for the lowest-energy (nonpolar) surfaces of two materials
of identical chemical composition (rutile and anatase), the C 1s core
level shift of adsorbed methanol versus methoxy differs by 0.8 eV
due to differences in H bonds and core-hole final-state screening.
