Aziridines are important synthetic
intermediates for the generation
of nitrogen-containing molecules. N-Acylaziridines
undergo rearrangement by ring expansion to produce oxazolines, a process
known as the Heine reaction. The first catalytic, enantioselective
Heine reaction is reported for meso-N-acylaziridines where a palladium(II)–diphosphine complex
is employed. The highly enantioenriched oxazoline products are valuable
organic synthons and potential ligands for transition-metal catalysis.

==== Body
Nonracemic oxazolines are highly
valued structures in organic synthesis.1−4 The five-membered heterocycles are employed
as functionalized building blocks for the production of biologically
active molecules and ligands for enantioselective catalysis.5−8 Typically enantioenriched oxazolines are synthesized from 1,2-amino
alcohols available from the chiral pool.2,9−14 The enantioselective synthesis of oxazolines from alkenes can be
performed with stoichiometric chiral modifiers;15−17 however, a
catalytic, enantioselective synthesis of oxazolines from achiral starting
materials is not available.18−23 Herein we report the first example of an enantioselective Heine
reaction, catalyzed by palladium(II)–diphosphine complexes,24,25 as a new strategy for generating enantioenriched oxazolines that
might be otherwise difficult to access.

Heine and co-workers
were the first to utilize N-acylaziridines as synthetic
precursors to oxazolines under Lewis
acid catalysis.26 Subsequently, Heine’s
group also explored mild Lewis base catalysts for the rearrangement
reaction that now bears his name.27−30 Chiral N-acylaziridines
can undergo stereospecific rearrangement to enantioenriched oxazolines
under Lewis acid catalysis,19,31−34 and a mechanism for this process has been proposed.35,36meso-N-Acylaziridines offer the
opportunity to control the absolute stereochemistry during oxazoline
formation by enantioselective catalysis; however, only racemic oxazolines
have been produced by a direct Lewis acid-catalyzed Heine reaction.19 Two methods for enantioenriched oxazoline formation
from aziridine desymmetrization intermediates are known (Scheme 1).37,38 In both examples, the ring-opened intermediate (1)
was isolated with varying levels of enantiomeric excess, and only
one substrate was cyclized to the oxazoline 2. The current
work accomplishes a direct catalytic, highly enantioselective aziridine
rearrangement to oxazoline (3 → 4, Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Enantioselective
Synthesis of Oxazolines by N-Acylaziridine
Desymmetrization
Our research group has been interested in novel synthetic
methods
that incorporate N-acylaziridines.34,39 The majority of enantioselective processes incorporating N-acylaziridines have been Lewis acid-catalyzed desymmetrization
of meso-aziridines by ring opening reactions with
nucleophiles.37,38,40−54 Benzoyl-protected aziridines have proven to be the most successful
in these desymmetrization reactions; however, early efforts in our
group to develop an enantioselective Heine reaction using these aziridines
were completely nonselective despite evidence for metal catalysis.
We considered the strategy of transition-state organization by 2-point
binding as a solution. While N-(2-picolinoyl)-aziridines
have been successfully employed for ring opening desymmetrization,48−54 we identified 3-acylisoxazoles as a novel directing group (3, Scheme 1). The isoxazole structure is highly modular at the C4 and C5 positions
which enables tuning of reaction yield and enantioselectivity.

Aziridine 5 was produced from the corresponding N-tosylaziridine for a catalyst survey (Table 1). Commercially available metal
triflate salts and ligands (Figure 1) were complexed in dichloromethane with 4 Å molecular
sieves prior to the addition of aziridine 5. A large
variety of catalysts produced oxazoline 6 as a single
diastereomer, with a relevant sample shown in Table 1. Interestingly, oxazoline-based ligands
gave the best initial hits with lanthanide and copper triflates (entries
1–4). The copper(II)–BOX complexes were promising with
high conversion and good enantioselectivity, but adjustment of reaction
parameters could not improve selectivity above 82% ee (entry 4). While
considering other late transition metals with BOX ligands (entries
5–6), we discovered that palladium(II)–BINAP derived
catalysts produced very good ee with reduced conversion (entries 7–8).
The μ-hydroxy dimeric palladium(II) catalyst55,56 (7) was inactive (entry 9). Further investigation of
diphosphine ligands revealed DTBM-SEGPHOS as the optimal choice following a solvent switch to toluene (entries
10–11).57−60 Alternative noncoordinating anions were inferior to triflate (entry
12–13), and lowering the catalyst loading to 5 mol % was possible,
albeit with diminished enantioselectivity (entry 14).

Figure 1 Ligand structures surveyed
for the catalytic, enantioselective
Heine reaction.

The effect of isoxazole
structure on the reaction outcome was investigated
(8, Table 2). Slight modifications to reaction conditions were employed with
7 mol % of [DTBM-SEGPHOS]Pd(OTf)2 producing adequate yield
and enantioselectivity after 40 h at room temperature. Adjusting the
steric size of the 5-isoxazole substituent (R2) had only
a slight effect on yield and enantioselectivity (entries 1–6).
The trend was not linear, with methyl (entry 2) and tert-butyl (entry 6) producing the highest enantioselectivities. A 5-phenyl
substituent suppressed the yield but generated high levels of enantioselectivity
(entry 7). Aziridines containing a 4-isoxazole substituent resulted
in similar yields and enantioselectivities (entries 8–9). The
4-iodo derivative is an interesting compound for further functionalization.

meso-Aziridines with structurally diverse backbones
were synthesized as both the 5-methyl and 5-tert-butyl-3-acylisoxazole
derivatives (10, Table 3). The changes in aziridine structure led to significant
decreases in turnover for most substrates at room temperature. To
combat slower reactions, catalyst loading was increased to 10 mol
%, and reaction temperature was optimized for yield and enantioselectivity
of oxazoline 11. Under the modified standard conditions,
substrates containing a 6-membered ring carbocyclic aziridine backbone
gave high yields and excellent ee values (entries 1–2, Table 3). Decreasing the
ring size gave comparable results (entry 3) where incorporation of
the 5-tert-butyl isoxazole produced a decrease in
yield, but the highest ee observed in the study (entry 4). A 7-membered
carbocyclic backbone resulted in significant issues with conversion
though enantioselectivity remained high (entries 5–6). After
7 days at 30 °C, only 40% and 44% yields could be isolated for
the two isoxazole variations. When accounting for recovered starting
material, high yield was observed for the tert-butyl
derivative (entry 6). Incorporation of oxygen in the aziridine backbone
was possible utilizing a dioxepine ring (entry 7) or tetrahydrofuran
ring (entry 8), albeit with reduced enantioselectivity and yield.
An acyclic meso-aziridine was a very good substrate
when performed at room temperature where enantioselectivities were
highest (entries 9–10).

mmol), and 100 mg of 4 Å powdered molecular sieves in 2:1 toluene/CH2Cl2 (0.2 M).

e Reaction solvent was CH2Cl2.

Aqueous HCl in ethyl
acetate rapidly converts oxazoline 12 to 1,2-hydroxyamide 13 by ring opening (Scheme 2). Such rapid hydrolysis of 12 was not
surprising as certain purified oxazolines produced
by rearrangement hydrolyzed during storage under ambient conditions.
Independent synthesis of amide 13 proved the absolute
configuration of oxazoline 12 to be 4S,5R when the R catalyst was employed.

Scheme 2 Hydrolysis of Enantioenriched Oxazoline 12
The enantioselective rearrangement
of aziridine 14 was scaled to 1 mmol with reduced yield,
but an increase in ee (Scheme 3). Following the
reaction, the catalyst mixed with 4 Å mol sieves was collected
by filtration before purification of oxazoline 12 by
column chromatography. The recovered catalyst was a single diastereomer
by 1H NMR and has a structure consistent with 15 by HRMS (Figure 2). Confirmation of 15 was obtained following treatment
with pyridine to free the oxazoline portion for analysis. A crossover
experiment was performed by subjecting aziridine 5 to
rearrangement conditions with 7 mol % of 15 (Scheme 3). Oxazoline 6 was produced in nearly identical yield and enantioselectivity
as standard conditions (entry 2, Table 2). This experiment suggests that the active catalyst
is formed in situ from 15.61

Scheme 3 Enantioselective Heine Reaction Scale-Up
Figure 2 Structure of recovered catalyst from reaction scale-up.

A proposed reaction mechanism is provided in Figure 3. The anhydrous,
premade catalyst58 (16) coordinates
the aziridine
(17) by 2-point binding. We favor binding to both nitrogen
atoms to form intermediate 18 based on the azaphilic
nature of palladium. Bond reorganization directly to the product bound
catalyst 19 occurs in the enantiodetermining step. We
propose that the cis-oxazoline product is generated
exclusively by C–O bond construction via an SNi
mechanism leading to retention of stereochemistry.36 The orientation of 18 would project substituents
on the aziridine backbone toward the chiral ligand. The requirement
of a triflate counterion may suggest a double inversion mechanism
involving triflate, which has not been ruled out. Intermediate 19 releases the product, likely by dissociative substitution,
to turn over the catalytic cycle. Slow release of product (20) by intermediate 19 may explain the requirement for
higher catalyst loading. The recovered catalyst 15 appears
to be a low energy intermediate that can be formed directly from 18, but re-enter the catalytic cycle.

Figure 3 Proposed mechanism for
the palladium-catalyzed, enantioselective
Heine reaction.

The first example of
a catalytic, enantioselective Heine reaction
has been described. A cationic palladium(II)–diphosphine catalyst
produces highly enantioenriched oxazoline products with good to excellent
yields across a series of structural modifications. The application
of the isoxazole-based oxazoline products as synthetic intermediates
and ligands for catalysis is currently being explored. Efforts are
underway to discern the reaction mechanism and apply this catalyst
system to new aziridine ring-opening reactions.

The active catalyst likely contains a palladium(II)−diphosphine
core structure. NMR of the reaction over time shows multiple 31P signals, but no indication of the precatalyst or free diphosphine
ligand. Also, the rearrangement of 5 with a product-derived
catalyst, (6)Pd(OTf2), produced 6 in 40% yield and 17% ee.
