Colloidal
synthesis routes have been recently used to fabricate
heterogeneous catalysts with more controllable and homogeneous properties.
Herein a method was developed to modify the surface composition of
colloidal nanocrystal catalysts and to purposely introduce specific
atoms via ligands and change the catalyst reactivity. Organic ligands
adsorbed on the surface of iron oxide catalysts were exchanged with
inorganic species such as Na2S, not only to provide an
active surface but also to introduce controlled amounts of Na and
S acting as promoters for the catalytic process. The catalyst composition
was optimized for the Fischer–Tropsch direct conversion of
synthesis gas into lower olefins. At industrially relevant conditions,
these nanocrystal-based catalysts with controlled composition were
more active, selective, and stable than catalysts with similar composition
but synthesized using conventional methods, possibly due to their
homogeneity of properties and synergic interaction of iron and promoters.

Introduction
Supported metal nanoparticles have a wide
range of applications,
varying from drug delivery to heterogeneous catalysis.1−3 In particular, supported metal nanoparticles pave a route to rational
catalyst design, and design strategies include optimal metal–support
interaction, interparticle distance, uniform particle size, structure,
and morphology.4−7 Established preparation methods such as precipitation (coprecipitation
or deposition precipitation) and impregnation (incipient wetness impregnation
or wet impregnation) are commonly used; however, other techniques
including melt infiltration, colloidal synthesis, atomic layer deposition,
and metal–organic frameworks have become increasingly popular.8

To improve the catalytic performance of
supported metal nanoparticles,
other elements are often added, and they can be classified as structural,
electronic, or reduction promoters.9,10 Ideally, promoters
should be in close proximity with the catalytic active metal surface,
but this is usually not achieved as promoters also deposit on the
support surface. The promoters are typically introduced to supported
catalytic systems via impregnation or coprecipitation with promoter
metal salt precursor solution, and the drawback is a lack of control
on the location of the promoters. However, strong electrostatic adsorption
and controlled surface reactions (catalytic reduction or direct redox
reaction) methods were proven to introduce promoters selectively onto
the catalytically active metal surface.11,12

The
increase in global demand for lower olefins (ethylene, propylene,
butylenes) coupled with the regional diversification of carbon raw
materials brings about opportunities for emerging technologies.13 The alternative carbon feedstocks, including
coal, natural gas, and biomass, can first be converted to synthesis
gas, a mixture of CO and H2.14,15 Synthesis
gas can subsequently be used to produce fuels and chemicals, including
lower olefins and oxygenates.16−18 The commercial production of
lower olefins from synthesis gas is via methanol (methanol-to-olefins),19,20 but direct routes, namely, oxide-zeolite (OX-ZEO)21,22 and Fischer–Tropsch to olefins (FTO),23 offer potentially higher efficiencies in volume, energy,
materials, plant operations, and cost. The Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis (FTS), recognized to be structure-sensitive and promoter-dependent,
is a surface polymerization reaction, and its product distribution
can be described using the Anderson–Schulz–Flory (ASF)
model.24,25 Promoted iron-based catalysts26,27 as well as cobalt-based catalysts28 are
promising candidates for the FTO reaction at elevated temperature.

Typical promoters for Fe-based catalysts include, K, Cu, Mn, Na,
and S, and they are introduced via coimpregnation or coprecipitation
of promoter precursor.29−31 Recently, Sasol presented the effects of various
promoters on 306 bulk-Fe catalysts prepared via precipitation.32 It was concluded that bulk-Fe catalysts with
Na/S ≥ 2 performed best in terms of activity and selectivity
toward lower olefins, which is in line with Torres Galvis et al.26 However, this study was performed on bulk-Fe
catalysts, and the promotion effects on supported Fe-based catalysts
require more investigation. As catalysts are synthesized by coprecipitation
or coimpregnation of the different species, determining the amount
of the different atoms per nanoparticle and their arrangement in the
catalyst nanoparticle structure remains a challenge. This suggests
that new strategies are required to incorporate promoters in catalyst
nanoparticles in a controlled way to obtain nanocrystals (NCs) with
a homogeneous composition.

NCs prepared by colloidal synthesis,
offer delicate control over
size, shape, composition, crystal structure, and surface properties.33 Thus, they are promising and appealing building
blocks for advanced materials and devices, including hydrogen storage,
electronics, drug delivery, and catalysis.34−36 In particular,
NCs were used to study structure sensitivities37,38 and metal–support interfaces in catalytic applications.39

We recently demonstrated that colloidal
NCs with very narrow size
dispersion (10% standard deviation) and tunable size in the 3–20
nm range can be successfully used to fabricate active heterogeneous
catalysts with exceptional stability.40 The performance of these catalysts could be improved by the incorporation
of promoter species on their surface, but this cannot be achieved
with conventional methods. The key characteristic of colloidal NC
is that they are capped with a layer of surfactants, which are essential
to control their growth but hinder their implementation in devices
and other applications. Therefore, a considerable scientific effort
is devoted to develop methods to eliminate ligands while preserving
NC stability.41,42 On the other hand, the presence
of ligands makes the NC surface a very versatile platform,43 and they even can be used as active agents to
direct a catalytic process.44 In addition,
ligands can be advantageously replaced with other species (ligand
exchange) to modify the surface properties of NCs and make them suitable
for specific applications, such as biocompatible polymer-coated45 and photochromic cluster-functionalized NCs.46

Interestingly, it has been demonstrated
that it is possible to
replace the long-chain ligands on the NC surface with inorganic charged
species, such as chalcogenides, OH–, and amide ions.36,47−49 Herein we propose to use Na2S and NaHS
to replace organic ligands and to drive Na and S promoter species
adsorption on the NC surface. By using the inorganic ligand exchange
strategy, it is possible to direct promoters onto the catalytically
active metal surface and provide a route to tune promoter concentration
on the metal. For this purpose, catalysts based on iron oxide NCs
supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were treated with a solution
of Na2S to replace the conventional oleate surfactants
with Na2S, acting as an inorganic ligand. This strategy
has the additional advantage of eliminating carbon-rich ligands which
could deactivate the catalyst.

The synthesized catalysts, consisting
of iron oxide NC with uniform
size and distribution on the CNT support as well as controllable composition
in promoters, were characterized with inductively-coupled plasma atomic
emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX), and in situ Mössbauer spectroscopy.
The catalytic performance of these catalysts was compared with that
of conventional catalysts at industrially relevant conditions (340
°C and 10 bar).

Experimental Methods
Synthesis of Colloidal
NC Catalysts
General Procedure
Iron oxide NCs
of 7 nm diameter were
synthesized according to literature procedures based on the aminolysis/alcholysis
of iron oleate.50−53 The as-synthesized, mainly oleate-capped, iron oxide NCs were then
anchored to a CNT support, successively treated with Na2S and dried. A detailed description of the different synthesis paths
is reported below.

Synthesis of 7 nm Fe NC.40
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and were used as
received. Initially, 0.43 g of oleic acid (C17H33CO2H or OLAC, 90%), 0.21 g of oleylamine (C17H33NH2 or OLAM, 70%), and 0.35 g of 1,2-hexadecanediol
(C16H33(OH)2, ≥ 98%) in 10
mL of 1-octadecene (C18H36 or ODE, 90%) were
mixed in a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. The flask was connected
to a Schlenk line through a reflux cooler. The mixture (magnetically
stirred at 650 rpm) was degassed for 30 min at 120 °C under vacuum
and subsequently purged with nitrogen flow. The temperature was lowered
to 90 °C before 0.21 g of iron pentacarbonyl (Aldrich, 99.99%)
in 1 mL of octadecene was injected. The temperature was then increased
to 290 °C at a rate of 20 °C per minute, and the mixture
was refluxed for 1 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and
further processed in air. The NC suspension was purified by three
cycles of dispersion in 200 μL of toluene and precipitation
in isopropanol; centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 min was necessary
to separate the NC from organic solution after each cycle.

Attachment
of 7 nm Fe NC on CNT (Approximately 3 wt % Fe Loading)40,54
The synthesized Fe NC and 800 mg multiwalled CNT (Bayer,
Baytubes C 150 HP, from 5 to 30 nm external diameter, sieve fraction
212–425 μm) were suspended in 10 mL of octadecene in
a 100 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. The mixture (magnetically
stirred at 400 rpm) was degassed for 30 min at 120 °C under vacuum
and subsequently purged with nitrogen flow. The temperature was increased
to 200 °C under nitrogen flow and kept at this temperature for
0.5 h. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature and further
processed in air. The Fe NC supported on CNT catalyst was washed 5
times with hexane and acetone (ratio 1:3) and finally dried at 60
°C for 1 h under static air, 120 °C for 3 h under static
air, and 80 °C for 3 h under vacuum.

Promotion using Na2S Inorganic Ligand Exchange
In the first step, 0.24
g of sodium sulfide nonahydrate (≥98%)
was sonicated in 20 mL of formamide (≥99.5%) for 1 h to obtain
a 0.05 M stock solution. In order to have a molar ratio of Na2S/Fe = 1, 100 mg of the synthesized Fe NC on CNT catalyst
was added into 1.2 mL of 0.05 M stock solution and magnetically stirred
at 400 rpm for 10 min. The molar concentration of the Na2S solution was decreased to obtain lower promotion levels of Na2S/Fe = 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1. Catalyst cFeP0.5 was prepared with
Na2S/Fe = 0.5. After the inorganic Na2S exchange
step, the following washing procedure was used: 1× ethanol, 4×
ethanol and acetone (ratio 1:3), and 1× acetone. Finally, the
drying procedure was 1 h under static air, 120 °C for 3 h under
static air, and room temperature for 3 h under vacuum.

Synthesis
of Reference Catalysts
The reference catalysts
were prepared using incipient wetness impregnation (IWI). To synthesize
the unpromoted 3 wt % Fe reference catalyst, 0.207 g of ammonium iron
citrate (Fluka, purum p.a., 14.5–16 wt % Fe) was first dissolved
in 0.5 mL of demineralized water and 0.25 mL of methanol (Aldrich,
99.8%) was then added. This solution was impregnated in a single step
on to 1.0 g of CNT, and the sample was dried in static air at 120
°C for 2 h. Heat treatment was performed at 500 °C for 2
h (5 °C/min; 100 mL/min for 1 g catalyst) under nitrogen flow,
and after the catalyst was cooled to room temperature, it was passivated
by increasing oxygen concentration stepwise (2% v/v increase every
30 min) until reaching 20% v/v. To synthesize the promoted 3 wt %
Fe reference catalyst, 0.202 g of ammonium iron citrate (Fluka, purum
p.a., 14.5–16 wt % Fe), 0.004 g of sodium citrate tribasic
dihydrate (Aldrich, ≥ 99%) and 0.005 g of iron(II) sulfate
heptahydrate (Aldrich, ≥ 99%) were used, and the procedure
was followed as described above. The reference catalysts were coded
iFe and iFeP0.5, which indicate unpromoted and promoted Fe nanoparticles
on CNT, respectively.

Characterization
The elemental loadings
of Fe, Na,
and S were determined with a Thermo Jarrell Ash model ICAP 61E trace
analyzer ICP-AES. Thermo gravimetric analysis–mass spectrometry
(TGA-MS) was used to determine the metal loadings and to verify the
presence of organic ligands, which give rise to a mass loss at 200–300
°C and specific MS peaks. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
was used to determine the iron particle size distribution and the
spatial distribution of iron nanoparticles on the support, before
and after catalytic tests. Scanning transmission electron microscopy-high
angle annular dark field (STEM-HAADF) images and EDX analyses were
obtained with an FEI Talos F200X transmission electron microscope,
operated at 200 kV and equipped with a high-brightness field emission
gun (X-FEG) and a Super-X G2 EDX detector. XPS spectra were acquired
on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer using an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) monochromatic small-spot X-ray source
operated at 75 W. Charging effects were corrected by using the adventitious
carbon C 1s (sp3) peak as reference for all samples at
a binding energy (BE) of 284.8 eV. Fitting of the spectra (BE, fwhm,
peak shape, asymmetry, number of species) was performed with CasaXPS.
The composition of the Fe phases before reaction, after reduction,
and at various FTO conditions was determined in situ with transmission 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. 57Fe Mössbauer
spectra were collected at 4.2 K with a sinusoidal velocity spectrometer
using a 57Co(Rh) source. Velocity calibration was carried
out using an α-Fe foil at room temperature. The temperature
of the source and the absorbing samples were kept identical during
the measurements. The Mössbauer spectra were fitted using the
Mosswinn 4.0 program.55 The experiments
were performed identically as a catalytic test in a state-of-the-art
high-pressure Mössbauer in situ cell.56 The high-pressure beryllium windows used in this cell contain 0.08%
Fe impurity whose spectral contribution was fitted and removed from
the final spectra.

Catalyst Performance
Catalytic experiments
were performed
using a high throughput 16 parallel fixed-bed reactors setup (Flowrence,
Avantium). Each reactor was loaded with 20 mg of catalyst (212–425
μm) and 200 mg SiC (212–425 μm) as diluent, except
iFe in which 80 mg catalyst and 50 mg SiC were loaded, so as to attain
similar catalyst bed lengths and CO conversions of 25–45% after
100 h. The catalysts were first reduced in situ at 340 °C (5
°C/min), 3 bar, He/H2 = 2, GHSV = 3600 h–1 for 2 h. The synthesis gas mixture (H2/CO/He = 60/30/10)
with GHSV = 3600 h–1 was introduced at 280 °C
and 3 bar, and temperature and pressure were subsequently increased
to 340 °C (2 °C/min) and 10 bar. The product stream was
analyzed using online gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A). Hydrocarbons
(C1–C9) were separated on an Agilent
J&W PoraBOND Q column, detected using an FID detector and quantified
against the TCD signal of the internal standard He. The permanent
gases (CO, H2, He, CO2, and CH4)
were separated on a ShinCarbon ST (no. 19043) column and quantified
against He as an internal standard using a TCD detector. Catalytic
activity, in terms of iron time yield (FTY), was expressed as moles
of CO converted per gram of Fe per second. CO conversion (%) was calculated
as XCO = (molCO in –
molCO out)/molCO in. The product selectivity
to hydrocarbons up to C9 was determined with online gas
chromatography (GC) and was calculated on a carbon atom basis. Selectivity
toward CO2 was also measured.

Results and Discussion
An overview of the fresh catalysts and their properties is presented
in Table 1. Different
batches of catalysts were synthesized using the identical procedure
and their elemental loadings are included in Table S1. Trace amounts of Na were found in blank CNT support and
that might result in variations of Na loadings in the catalysts.

The promotion level was altered
by varying the molar concentration
of the Na2S solution while keeping the other parameters
(e.g., duration, stirring rate, volume, and temperature) constant.
Increasing the molar concentration of the Na2S solution
to increase the promotion level was successful, as determined by the
increased Na and S elemental loadings. It is noteworthy to point out
that after correcting for Na present in the blank CNT, the Na/S molar
ratio for all promoted catalysts was close to 2, as in the Na2S precursor. This indicates that both Na and S are adsorbed
at the catalyst surface. XPS measurements proved that there were indeed
increased Na and S concentration on the surface, as the peak intensities
of S 2p (Figure S1a) and Na 1s (Figure S1b) increased upon increasing promotion.
The S 2p peak positions indicated the presence of oxidized sulfur
species such as sulfate (S4+ or S6+, ∼168
eV) as well as reduced species (S0 to S2–, ∼164 eV) for the promoted catalysts, implying the oxidation
of reduced S species upon air exposure since no oxidized S species
were added during syntheses.

Representative TEM images relevant
to catalyst cFeP0.5 are shown
in Figure 1. The NCs
distribution on the CNT support and average NC diameter (size statistics
from TEM images) do not significantly change after Na2S
treatment for 10 min, thereby demonstrating their stability upon inorganic
ligand exchange. On the other hand, prolonged mixing of the catalyst
powder with the Na2S solution (more than 30 min) and heating
up of the mixture to 50 °C led to an aggregation of Fe NCs (Figure S4). This indicates that the inorganic
ligand exchange can impact the stability of Fe-CNT catalysts even
in relatively mild conditions.

(b) and (c) 7 nm Fe NC attached

Recent work on colloidal NC synthesis and processing shows
that
organic ligands such as oleate could be replaced with charged inorganic
species in a ligand-exchange fashion, by mixing a suspension of colloidal
NC in apolar solvent with a solution of inorganic ligands in a polar
solvent with high dielectric constant.47 This procedure can be performed either in solution, where Fe NC
stability is preserved by the adsorption of charged species, or with
dispersed solids, where NC after deposition on a substrate are exposed
to a solution of the inorganic charged ligands. The latter mode of
exchange was applied because the NCs were already homogeneously distributed
and stabilized on the support.

As a comparison, we used a different
procedure by first exchanging
oleate with S2– ligands in solution and successively
assembling the NCs on CNTs. The iron oxide NC can be successfully
transferred to polar formamide by exchanging oleate with S2– (from Na2S) ligands in solution. Nevertheless, the NCs
formed aggregates rather than assembling homogeneously on the CNTs
in formamide (Figure S5). A possible explanation
is that charged species at the NC surface shield the van der Waals
interaction of NC with the electron-rich CNT surface, so that the
NCs just form aggregates upon drying.

STEM-EDX experiments allowed
for mapping C, O, Fe, Na, and S through
the sample, and a representative EDX map is included in Figure S6. The CNTs were distinguishable by the
C mapping, whereas Fe was present as nanometric iron oxide particles.
Oxygen was concentrated where the iron oxide nanoparticles were present.
Although Na and S were detected by the EDX detector, the concentrations
were too low for the detection limit of the instrument.

Reference
catalysts (iFe and iFeP0.5) were prepared via incipient
wetness impregnation, and HAADF-STEM images of iFe and iFeP0.5 are
shown in panels a and b of Figure 2, respectively. Figure 2c,d display HAADF-STEM images of colloidal NC catalysts,
cFe and cFeP0.5, respectively. Na2S impregnated onto Fe
NC on CNT was used to compare with the introduction of Na2S via inorganic ligand exchange. The particle size and particle size
distribution did not appear to be changed upon addition of promoters.
Although the surface average Fe particle size of IWI and colloidal
NC catalysts was similar, the particle size distribution of IWI catalysts
was broader (Figure 2e).

model catalysts (c) cFe and (d) cFeP0.5; (e) Particle size distributions
of iFeP0.5 and cFeP0.5.

The catalytic performance of these Fe-based catalysts under
industrially
relevant conditions, i.e. 10 bar, and 340 °C, H2/CO
= 2 v/v was investigated. Figure 3 displays the catalytic activity as a function of time,
thereby providing insights in the stability of these catalysts at
high temperature and pressure. The initial activities of the colloidal
catalysts (cFe, cFeP0.5, and cFeP0.5-iwi) were higher than the reference
IWI catalysts (iFe and iFeP0.5), and the addition of promoters also
increased initial activities.

Figure 3 Iron time yield (FTY) vs time on stream (TOS)
of unpromoted (red)
and promoted (blue) catalysts at 340 °C, 10 bar, H2/CO = 2 (reference IWI catalysts: solid symbols; model colloidal
catalysts: open symbols; promoted catalysts: blue symbols; unpromoted
catalysts: red symbols).

The general higher activity of colloidal catalysts (cFe over
iFe,
and both cFeP0.5 and cFeP0.5iwi over iFeP0.5) could be explained by
their superior homogeneity, in terms of nanocrystal catalyst size,
faceting, distribution on the support, so that the contribution of
bigger particles and aggregates can be neglected at the initial stage
of the FTO. The higher initial activity of promoted colloidal catalysts
compared to promoted catalysts obtained by IWI could be explained
accordingly by the more uniform composition of promoters on the catalyst
surface. After activation, the unpromoted catalysts (cFe and iFe)
were relatively stable over 100 h. On the other hand, iFeP0.5 showed
increasing activity but cFeP0.5 and cFeP0.5-iwi showed decreasing
activities. Although both cFeP0.5 and cFeP0.5-iwi deactivated over
time, the activity of cFeP0.5 dropped by approximately 33% and that
of cFeP0.5-iwi dropped by approximately 50%. This suggested that the
inorganic ligand exchange approach resulted in a more stable catalyst.

The activities and product selectivities of these catalysts after
100 h are summarized in Table 2. The product distribution was similar for the unpromoted
catalysts, but the colloidal catalyst cFe was more active than the
reference IWI catalyst iFe. After 100 h, the promoted catalysts were
more active and more selective toward lower olefins. The catalysts
with impregnated Na and S promoters (iFeP0.5 and cFeP0.5-iwi) showed
similar activities and product selectivities. However, the catalyst
with Na and S promoters introduced via inorganic ligand exchange showed
the
highest activity and selectivity toward lower olefins.

The improved
product selectivity of cFeP0.5 relative to iFeP0.5
is also evident from the ASF plots (Figure 4) in which the C1 fraction deviates
from the ASF statistical distribution. The promoted catalysts contained
similar level of Na and S promoter loadings but displayed different
catalytic performances, and this is tentatively proposed to be due
to the location of the Na and S promoters. S2– and
NaS– ions have a high affinity for the Fen+-rich Fe NC surface and thereby they can replace
organic ligands, such as oleate, thus justifying Na and S adsorption
specifically on the catalytic NC surface.

Figure 4c
illustrates
the influence of the promotion level on the activity and product selectivity
at industrially relevant conditions, i.e. 340 °C, 10 bar, H2/CO = 2, GHSV = 3600 h–1. Interestingly,
there is an optimum level of promotion at 10 bar which is not apparent
at 3 and 5 bar. At 3 and 5 bar, increasing promotion was beneficial
for both activity and product selectivity for all promotion levels.
However, at 10 bar the activity shows a maximum around 0.6 molar ratio,
while a further increase of promoter concentrations does not give
rise to activity enhancement but rather reduces the overall activity,
albeit producing the highest C2–C4 selectivity
and methane as low as 11%. There is further potential to increase
C2–C4 olefins selectivity by optimizing
the promotion level, while keeping activity high.

The effect
of promotion level at varied pressures (3, 5, and 10
bar) on the Fe NC catalysts was also evaluated. Several observations
were made on the effects of promotion level and pressures. First,
the increase in pressure led to an increase in activity (Figure S7). Second, the increase in promotion
level led to increase in an activity at various pressures, except
for the most promoted catalyst, cFeP1.0 at 10 bar (Figure S7). With increasing pressure, C2–C4 olefins selectivity decreased while C2–C4 paraffins selectivity increased (Figure S8). With increasing promotion level, the increase in C2–C4 olefins selectivity corresponded to
an increase in C5+ selectivity and a decrease in CH4 and C2–C4 paraffins’
selectivity (Figure S8). This suppression
of methane formation was made evident by the deviation of the C1 content from the ASF distribution prediction (Figure S9). Both increase in pressure and addition
of Na and S promoters increased α (Figure S9).

In situ Mössbauer spectroscopy was carried
out for unpromoted
cFe and promoted cFeP0.5 catalysts at different reaction stages, i.e.
after reduction, FTO at 3 and 5 bar, and FTO at 10 bar. Figure 5 summarizes the results on
the composition in iron species of the different catalysts at different
reaction stages, while detailed spectra and fits were included as Figure S11 and Table S5, respectively. Both cFe and cFeP0.5 were partially reduced upon
reduction, the latter showing nearly 40% composition in metallic iron.
Upon exposure to synthesis gas at 340 °C and higher pressure,
cFe was partially carbidized and carbidization increased slightly
with increase in pressure from 5 to 10 bar. On the other hand, cFeP0.5
was already significantly carburized after exposure to synthesis gas
at 340 °C and higher pressure, the extent of carbidization increasing
by increasing the pressure from 5 to 10 bar. Thus, the two key findings
from the catalytic tests, i.e. the higher catalytic activity of promoted
catalysts and the increased activity of cFeP0.5 upon increase in pressure
from 5 to 10 bar, can both be explained by the higher concentration
of active iron carbide species of the promoted catalysts compared
to their unpromoted counterparts.

Figure 5 Composition in iron species of unpromoted
cFe (left) and promoted
cFeP0.5 (right) catalysts at different reaction stages, i.e. after
reduction (red), FTO at 3 and 5 bar (gray) and FTO at 10 bar (blue)
determined by in situ Mössbauer spectroscopy.

The spent catalysts after FTO (TOS = 100 h) were
characterized
with TEM, as shown in Figure 6. All catalysts had similar average particle size after synthesis
as mentioned earlier, albeit broader particle size distributions were
measured for iFe and iFeP0.5. However, the particle size distributions
of spent catalysts were remarkably different. For the unpromoted catalysts
(iFe and cFe), average Fe nanoparticles grew from 7 to 11 nm upon
FTO reaction. Notably, the spent catalyst cFe possessed a bimodal
particle size distribution in comparison to iFe. For the catalysts
promoted via impregnation (iFeP0.5 and cFeP0.5-iwi), average Fe nanoparticles
grew from 7 to 18 nm upon FTO reaction, and there were significant
number of Fe nanoparticles larger than 25 nm. For the catalyst promoted
via inorganic ligand exchange (cFeP0.5), average Fe nanoparticles
grew from 7 to 14 nm upon FTO reaction, and no Fe nanoparticles larger
than 25 nm were observed. In addition, the spent catalyst of cFeP0.5
had the narrowest particle size distribution. Thus, growth of Fe nanoparticles
appeared to be less when Na and S promoters were introduced via inorganic
ligand exchange, and this is in good agreement with the constant trend
of the catalyst activity over time (Figure 3).

Figure 6 TEM images and particle size distribution of
fresh (lighter color)
and spent (darker color) catalysts (a,b) iFe, (c,d) iFeP0.5, (e,f)
cFe (g,h), cFeP0.5, and (i,j) cFeP0.5.

The size and promoter effects on stability were previously
investigated
and Fe particle growth was proposed to be the main cause of deactivation
for the promoted catalysts. With reference to Figure S12, this current study reiterates the preposition
that loss of active Fe surface area resulted in loss of activity.57

Conclusion
A novel approach toward
promoter incorporation in metal nanocrystal
catalysts was presented, and Fe-based FTO catalysts were used as a
showcase. New FTO catalysts were synthesized based on colloidal NCs
in which promoters are adsorbed on the surface of catalyst NCs via
ligand exchange. This method conveniently eliminates organic ligands,
which could interfere in the catalytic FT process, and more importantly
allows for active catalysts with a controlled amount of promoters
to be synthesized. Catalysts with different amounts of promoters were
tested under industrially relevant FT conditions at different pressures
and the process was optimized to achieve the best combination of activity
and product selectivity. These colloidal-based catalysts outperformed
catalysts with similar composition but synthesized with conventional
coimpregnation methods.

A correlation of these data with in
situ Mössbauer spectroscopy
and ex situ microscopy revealed that promoted colloidal catalysts
are more stable, easier to reduce and covert into active carbide species,
possibly due to the close contact of the promoters with the iron catalyst.

These results suggest that wet chemical methods, such as the combination
of colloidal synthesis, assembly and ligand exchange approaches, are
a viable route to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts with superior
properties control. The development of stable catalysts with controlled
characteristics acting as a model system is an essential step toward
understanding structure and composition-related catalytic features.
Notably, the method described was applied to an extremely complex
catalytic system, since iron catalysts undergo severe transformations
in the course of a FTO process, but could be further extended to several
NC catalyst systems and types of promoters. In addition, this preliminary study strengthens the idea that
recent achievements in the ligand-driven chemistry, such as controlling
the number and the position of heteroatoms on specific NC facets,
could be applied to manipulate the composition, and thus the reactivity,
of catalytic surfaces.
