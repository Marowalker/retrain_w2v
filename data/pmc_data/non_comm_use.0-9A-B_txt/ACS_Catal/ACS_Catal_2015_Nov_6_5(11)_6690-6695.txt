Supported metal nanoparticle catalysts
are commonly obtained through
deposition of metal precursors onto the support using incipient wetness
impregnation. Typically, empirical relations between metal nanoparticle
structure and catalytic performance are inferred from ensemble averaged
data in combination with high-resolution electron microscopy. This
approach clearly underestimates the importance of heterogeneities
present in a supported metal catalyst batch. Here we show for the
first time how incipient wetness impregnation leads to 10-fold variations
in silver loading between individual submillimeter-sized silica support
granules. This heterogeneity has a profound impact on the catalytic
performance, with 100-fold variations in hydrogenation performance
at the same level. In a straightforward fashion, optical microscopy
interlinks single support particle level catalytic measurements to
structural and compositional information. These detailed correlations
reveal the optimal silver loading. A thorough consideration of catalyst
heterogeneity and the impact thereof on the catalytic performance
is indispensable in the development of catalysts.

Introduction
Supported platinum
group metal (PGM) nanoparticles are heavily
used as hydrogenation catalysts; however, their price and future availability
call for alternatives. Even though silver is mostly known as an oxidation
catalyst, e.g. in the industrial production of ethylene oxide and
methanol, various research groups have shown that supported silver
nanoparticles can also chemoselectively catalyze the hydrogenation
of unsaturated aldehydes, esters, and nitro compounds;1−5 for the last example silver offers the unique possibility to chemoselectively
reduce functional nitroaromatics to the corresponding anilines, which
is not possible with PGM nanoparticles.6,7 The available
information indicates that selective hydrogenation on supported silver
catalysts is a structure-sensitive reaction in which, in addition
to the structure of the substrate, also nanoparticle size and support
material play an important role.1,2,8−10 In the selective hydrogenation of the unsaturated
aldehydes crotonaldehyde and acrolein an increased reactivity and
selectivity to the desired alcohol was found with increasing silver
nanoparticle size.1,9 This observation was related to
the larger fraction of Ag(111) surfaces. In contrast, smaller silver
nanoparticles (0.9–3 nm) were found to be superior in the selective
hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene11 and acrolein12 in the high-pressure range. These observations
can be rationalized by the rate-limiting dissociation of H2 at coordinatively unsaturated silver sites and the adsorption geometry
of the substrate. As often, these experimental results on the structure
sensitivity of chemoselective hydrogenation with silver nanoparticles
are seemingly contradictory, making clear-cut structure–activity
assessments far from trivial. Supported-metal-catalyzed reactions
are inherently chemically complex, and subtle changes in catalyst
structure and properties can clearly have an important impact on the
outcome.13,14 Rationalization of bulk catalytic performances,
even when supported by molecular simulations, often oversimplify the
inherent complexity of the supported metal catalyst itself.15 In addition to nanoparticle size and crystal
facets also variations in loading, distribution, and accessibility
could play an important role in the overall catalytic performance.
Essential when experimentally establishing correct structure–activity
relationships is the generation of nanoparticles of well-controlled
sizes. However, it is known that common catalyst synthesis strategies
preclude variability in nanoparticle size,16−18 making validation
of the nanoparticle size indispensable. In addition to bulk techniques
such as X-ray diffraction, chemisorption, and EXAFS that generally
yield average nanoparticle diameters within a supported catalyst,9 direct imaging using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) allows precise determination of nanoparticle dimensions and
dispersion.19 As a result of the atomic
resolution that can be achieved via TEM imaging, this approach is
often the only suitable technique to study the size and dispersion
of supported nanoparticles at the nanometer scale. Unfortunately,
no direct link between these offline measurements and the catalytic
performance can be made; thus, the catalytically active nanoparticles
cannot be discriminated from spectator species.20,21

In this study we report that typical incipient wetness impregnation
results in an unexpected 10-fold variation in silver loading between
individual silica gel support granules, leading to intersupport granule
variations in number and size of the silver nanocatalysts. To validate
the impact thereof on the catalytic performance, the selective reduction
of 4-nitrostyrene to 4-vinylaniline was chosen. The aforementioned
interparticle heterogeneity in silver loading leads to 100-fold variations
in hydrogenation performance, and by using optical microscopy, it
is possible to identify the optimal silver loading of the best-performing
supported metal catalyst granules.

Experimental Section
Catalyst
Preparation
An aqueous AgNO3 solution,
equaling the total pore volume of the support material, was added
dropwise to dried silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka 60752) until a
slurry formed. After equilibration at room temperature the impregnated
samples were dried overnight in air in an oven at 100 °C and
finally calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. Control samples were obtained
by calcining commercial AgNO3 on silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich
248762) in air at 500 °C for 2 h. In this work this catalyst
is referred to as “commercial Ag/SiO2”.

Optical Microscopy
Images were obtained via the eyepieces
using an adapter from Micro-Tech-Lab (Austria) to connect a Canon
EOS5D color camera to an Olympus BX51 Upright microscope with a standard
mercury lamp, equipped with infinity corrected air objectives 4×
(0.16 N.A.) and 20× (0.40 N.A.). Color sorting of individual
supported silver catalyst granules was performed on a stereomicroscope
(Leica M165FC).

Scanning Electron Microscopy
High-resolution
SEM images
were obtained with a Nova NanoSEM 450 instrument (FEI). SEM-EDX was
conducted using a FEI XL30FEG electron microscope equipped with an
EDAX detector. Spectral analysis and quantification were performed
with Genesis 4.61 software. Samples were mounted onto a copper TEM
grid (300 mesh, Agar Scientific) fixed on a gold-coated cover slide
which was then immobilized on to an aluminum stub using carbon sticker.
These were imaged without any further sample modification.

Catalytic
Performance Testing at the Bulk Level
Bulk
hydrogenation reactions were performed in high-pressure 15 mL TOP
reactors and a 100 mL Parr reactor (2 h, 110 °C, 20 bar of H2, 0.35 mol % of Ag, 70 mM 4-nitrostyrene in DMA, and 500 rpm
unless stated otherwise). Analysis of the reaction products was carried
out using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, CP-Sil 5, FID detector),
and n-tetradecane was added as internal standard
for quantitative GC analysis. Identification of the compounds was
carried out using GC-MS.

Catalytic Performance Testing at the Single
Support Particle
Level
Individual single-granule hydrogenation reactions were
performed by use of a multiwell placed in a 100 mL Parr reactor, enabling
21 reactions in parallel. Prior to the catalytic reaction, single
support particles were carefully placed one by one in the different
wells via an eyelash manipulator and a stereomicroscope (Leica M165FC).
After this, the multiwell could be filled with the reaction solution
using a micropipette and placed in the reactor. Since thermal hydrogenation
of 4-nitrostyrene results in the formation of the unwanted 4-ethylnitrobenzene
and little 4-vinylaniline, in each run several wells were not filled
with a catalyst particle to account for this blank conversion and
some wells were only filled with solvent to ensure that no cross contamination
had occurred. To lower solvent evaporation as much as possible, the
high-boiling N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMA) was used as a solvent and n-hexadecane as an
internal standard for quantitative GC analysis. Optimization of reaction
conditions led to the use of 18 μL of a 33 mM 4-NSt solution
in each microwell, with hydrogenation performed under 20 bar of H2 on heating to 110 °C for 2.5 h in a Parr reactor filled
with 3 mL of DMA. Analysis of the reaction products was carried out
using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, CP-Sil 5, FID detector) after
rinsing the wells two times with pure DMA.

Results and Discussion
Compositional
Heterogeneities at the Micro- and Nanoscale
Supported silver
catalysts (5–6 wt % Ag) on silica gel were
synthesized via standard incipient wetness impregnation.4,17 During calcination of the white silver nitrate impregnated silica
powder, silver oxide was formed and subsequently at temperatures above
400 °C completely decomposed into metallic silver.22,23 The resulting silica-supported silver nanoparticle catalyst powder
has a typical yellowish appearance and looks seemingly homogeneous.
However, close inspection using optical microscopy revealed an unexpected
variability in color between different support granules (Figure 1A–C); to our
knowledge this interparticle color heterogeneity has not been reported
so far for supported metal catalysts. An even more pronounced interparticle
color heterogeneity, ranging from transparent to yellow to red-brown,
was observed in a supported silver catalyst (6 wt % Ag) made by calcining
commercial AgNO3 on silica gel obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Figure 1D–F).
Strikingly, within one large support granule of about 100 μm
in diameter no significant color variation was observed.

granule level revealed by optical microscopy: (A–C) silver

heterogeneity (n = 250) illustrated with pie diagrams.
The colors represent the red color index of individual Ag/SiO2 granules (for determination see the text in the Supporting Information and Figure S1).

Since pure silica powder is optically transparent,
also after a
similar heat treatment, the observed color formation must be associated
with the silver nanoparticles. It is well-known that the optical appearance
of silver nanoparticles is related to the surface plasmon resonance.
Next to nanoparticle shape and refractive index of the environment,
plasmon absorbance and hence selective (visible) light absorption
is largely determined by the nanoparticle size.24 For silver nanoparticles in silica below about 10 nm diameter
the surface plasmon resonance peaks at around 420 nm, resulting in
a yellow appearance upon white light illumination. Increasing the
size to around 100 nm diameter results in a strong red shift of about
100 nm, which causes red coloration.25 Nitrogen
physisorption measurements of the used silica gel provide a BJH desorption
average pore width of 60 Å (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Although the rather broad pore size
distribution would give rise to polydisperse silver nanoparticles
formed inside the support pores, their size is restricted to below
10 nm, resulting in an overall yellowish appearance. The presence
of larger, unconfined silver nanoparticles at the outer surface of
the support granules could give rise to color variations. However,
several other factors will influence the optical appearance such as
the local nanoparticle concentration and the absolute support granule
size, which is directly linked to the optical path length and hence
the resulting light absorption.25 Since
no relation was found between optical appearance and the absolute
support granule size, the latter can be excluded and the color heterogeneity
between individual silica granules must be sought at the level of
the supported silver nanoparticles.

In order to investigate
the color heterogeneity at the silver nanoparticle
level, we resorted to high-resolution scanning electron microscopy
(HR-SEM) correlated with optical microscopy. First, the optical appearance
of the silica-supported silver catalyst was examined via optical microscopy
after deposition of the granules on a coverslip with a marked copper
grid. Then, HR-SEM was performed to probe the outer surface of the
same support granules, of which the optical color is known. Marks
on the copper grid and the irregular shape of the support granules
make the correlation of the optical images and SEM micrographs highly
reliable (Figure 2A,B).
By specifical probing of the outer surface of transparent, yellow,
and red granules, three distinct silver nanoparticle size ranges were
noticed: 1–10, 20–50, and >400 nm (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The relative contribution
of the larger 20–50 nm nanoparticles increases with increasing
coloration, and the extremely large silver crystals (>400 nm) were
only visible on the dark red silica granules (Figure 2C and Figure S3E). These electron micrographs thus evidence that there is a clear
relation between color targeted via optical imaging and silver nanoparticle
size at the outer surface of the support granules.

Ag/SiO2 granules measured via energy dispersive X-ray analysis.
(F) Link between red color index of individual Ag/SiO2 granules
and their silver loading. The results shown here were obtained from
the commercial 6 wt % Ag/SiO2 catalyst.

However, these findings do not exclude the possibility
that the
optical heterogeneity can also be induced by a difference in silver
nanoparticle concentration, analogous to the observed heterogeneity
in Pt/zeolite Y catalysts.19 Therefore,
we adopted energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy to probe the
silver content of individual silica support granules, again directly
correlated to the optical appearance of the exact same granules (Figure 2D). Figure 2E shows that typical supported
silver catalysts, obtained from a commercial supplier or via standard
impregnation methods, display at least a 10-fold variation in silver
loading between different silica support granules. Comparison of the
EDX results and color indexing of the optical images led to a clear
trend between optical appearance and silver content (Figure 2F). Since the silver content
determined via SEM-EDX is limited to the first few micrometers below
the outer surface, this approach could lead to a misinterpretation
of the total silver loading of this support granule because a silver
gradient might exist along the cross section of the support granule.26 To further validate the SEM-EDX measurements,
focused ion beam (FIB) milling was used to section a yellow granule
in the middle. A clear silver gradient can be observed, with silver
concentrations decreasing from the outer surface of the granule toward
the center; even in the center significant silver amounts could still
be detected (Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information). Furthermore, on these FIB sections no large silver nanoparticles
were observed in the interior of the support granules with high-resolution
SEM.

These correlated microscopy data link the optical appearance
of
a support granule to both silver concentration and size of nonpore
confined silver nanoparticles at the outer surface. The increasing
coloration observed in optical microscopy is related to both variations
in silver loading and the presence of larger silver nanoparticles
at the outer surface of the support granules. These calibration data
can now be used to quantify the amount of silver in every support
granule by simply using optical images. Optical microscopy is easily
accessible without lengthy sample preparation and allows rapid determination
of interparticle heterogeneity on the support granule level. Metal
loading quantifications based on optical images rely on correlations
with other analytical methods such as EDX, HR-SEM, etc.

Linking Hydrogenation
Performance to Catalyst Composition via
Catalytic Measurements at the Single Support Particle Level
Because of the large variability in silver loading and nanoparticle
size it is not straightforward to unequivocally link performance to
catalyst properties, certainly not from typical ensemble averaged
measurements using at least milligrams of powdered catalyst. In this
study we measured for the first time the catalytic performance at
the level of the individual silica support granule. In order to minimize
variations in experimental conditions, multiwell plates were used
enabling 21 reactions in parallel in the same high-pressure Parr reactor;
the multiwell catalytic measurements at the single support particle
are shown schematically in Figure 3. These multiwell plates also allow recording of optical
transmission images of the individual supported catalyst granules
placed in each reaction well; from these optical images the exact
silver content in every microwell is determined, which is critical
for normalizing catalyst performance. Subsequently, after 590 nmol
of 4-nitrostryrene (4-NSt) in 18 μL of N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) solvent was added, the multiwell
plate was loaded in the Parr hydrogenation reactor at 20 bar of H2 and heated to 110 °C; under these conditions no distillation
of the reactant or its products was observed. After 2.5 h the reaction
mixture of every microwell was analyzed via gas chromatography. Figure 4A shows the normalized
catalytic performance of 47 individual supported catalyst granules
as a function of their total silver loading (more details are given
in the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Schematic representation
of a multiwell catalytic measurement at
the single support particle level. In a typical run around 13 catalyst
granules were tested together with four blank tests and two wells
were only filled with solvent (18 μL of a 33 mM 4-NSt solution
in each microwell, 20 bar of H2, 110 °C, 2.5 h, 100
mL Parr reactor filled with 3 mL of DMA).

Figure 4 (A) Single-granule catalytic hydrogenation of 4-nitrostyrene with
commercial Ag/SiO2 catalyst: results of 47 individual silver
supported silica granules. Estimation of silver loading was based
on red color index and SEM-EDX, complemented by ICP-AES measurements
of color-sorted granules. More details can be found in the text and Figure S5 of the Supporting Information. (B) Bulk hydrogenation reactions with color-sorted commercial Ag/SiO2 samples (column bars), displaying up to a 2.5-fold increase
of yield with respect to unsorted commercial catalyst (filled area)
(110 °C, 20 bar of H2, 2.5 h).

These single support particle data undoubtedly reveal an
optimal
silver loading. Granules with about 6 wt % of silver show up to 100-fold
higher normalized 4-vinylaniline yield in comparison to catalyst granules
from the same batch containing <4 wt % or >8 wt % of silver.
From
the detailed physicochemical characterization (vide supra) the highest
hydrogenation performance can be attributed to support granules with
yellow appearance (red color index 0.12–0.20): i.e., 5–7
wt % silver. These yellow granules contain in addition to the 6 nm
pore confined silver nanoparticles also a reasonable amount of larger,
20–50 nm silver nanoparticles on the surface of the support
granule. When a whole support granule is considered, the pore confined
silver nanoparticles represent over 99.9% of the total number of nanoparticles.
Silver in these yellow granules is up to 100 times more efficiently
used as in highly loaded (>8 wt % Ag) support granules, with silver
nanoparticles larger than 400 nm on the support’s outer surface,
and as in transparent granules (<4 wt % Ag) which only contain
the pore confined 6 nm silver nanoparticles. Hence, it can be concluded that in this sample support granules
with 6 wt % silver and the highest relative contribution of 20–50
nm silver nanoparticles are the most active in the selective 4-nitrostyrene
reduction, contradicting earlier reports based on ensemble-averaged
hydrogenation data.11

Rationally
Improving the Hydrogenation Performance of Supported
Silver Catalysts
In order to validate these single support
particle results, namely that the catalyst granule’s optical
appearance is linked to the silver content and its catalytic performance,
we carried out bulk catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Ag/SiO2 samples with four different silver contents ranging from
4 to 19 wt % at the bulk level were synthesized. As expected, all
of these materials showed a significant interparticle heterogeneity
in optical appearance (Figure S6 in the
Supporting Information). Using the average performance determined
for every color of catalyst granule via single support particle experiments,
the estimated theoretical 4-vinylaniline yield of each of these catalyst
samples was estimated (Figure 5; the calculation is explained in the Supporting Information). These calculations predict that the
sample with a bulk loading of 13 wt % in silver should show the best
selective hydrogenation performance. Indeed, in a typical hydrogenation
reaction with 0.35 mol % silver and with the same relative amounts
of substrate and solvent as were used in the multiwell experiments,
a similar performance trend was observed (Figure 5). In addition, the results of the commercial
Ag/SiO2 sample (6 wt %) fit perfectly within the results
of the self-synthesized samples. The outcome of the single support
particle experiments can thus undoubtedly be extrapolated to the bulk
level. Although the normalized yield of the commercial sample increased
by 38% upon increasing the overall silver loading to 13 wt %, a considerably
higher improvement must be possible on the basis of the observed heterogeneity.
Ideally one would rationally synthesize a batch which consists of
only yellow supported silver catalyst granules; however, none of the
typical impregnation approaches gave a satisfactory result. In an
attempt to obtain a more homogeneous catalyst sample, the commercial
silver on silica catalyst was manually sorted into three different
fractions (Figure S7 in the Supporting
Information). As can be expected from the single support particle
experiments, the batch with yellow support granules outperforms the
batches with transparent or orange and red granules to the same degree
as could be expected from the single support particle studies (Figure 4B).

of 4-nitrostyrene with self-synthesized
(4 to 10, 13, and 19 wt % Ag) and commercial 6 wt % Ag/SiO2 catalysts (■) and estimated theoretical yield based on optical
appearance (□) (for the determination see the Supporting Information, silver loading based on ICP-AES) (110
°C, 20 bar of H2, 2 h).

Conclusions
We have shown that typical incipient wetness
impregnation brings
about severe heterogeneity in metal loading at the support particle
level. Specifically, 10-fold variations in silver metal loading between
individual silica support granules are no exception within one catalyst
batch. These differences in metal loading severely affect the catalytic
performance on measurement at the same scale. Here optical microscopy
proved to be a convenient tool to directly interlink the physicochemical
properties and hydrogenation performance of individual support particles.
Following this approach, we could resolve 100-fold variations in normalized
catalytic performance for the selective 4-nitrostyrene reduction and
determine the optimal silver loading for this reaction. More specifically,
these single-particle experiments indicate that support granules which
have the relative highest contribution of silver nanoparticles of
about 20–50 nm show the highest 4-vinylaniline (4-VAn) yield.
Following traditional catalyst impregnation optimization based on
ensemble averaged characterization and catalytic performance measurements
it would be far from trivial to find this optimal catalyst composition.
The proposed optical screening method is widely applicable to supported
metal catalysts: e.g., similar heterogeneity in color and thus loading
were also observed in Pt/SiO2 (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).
