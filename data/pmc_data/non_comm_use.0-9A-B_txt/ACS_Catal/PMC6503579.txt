Deoxygenative
hydrogenation of amides to amines homogeneously catalyzed
by a complex of an Earth-abundant metal is presented. This manganese-catalyzed
reaction features high efficiency and selectivity. A plausible reaction
mechanism, involving metal–ligand cooperation of the manganese
pincer complex, is proposed based on NMR studies and relevant stoichiometric
reactions.

==== Body
Metal–ligand cooperation
(MLC) is a powerful activation mode in transition-metal catalysis,
which has fascinated chemists for many years.1 It has grown into, and will continue to be, a popular and flourishing
research field. In this regard, our group developed a mode of MLC
involving aromatization/dearomatization by metal pincer complexes,
which found broad applications in the activation of C–H, N–H,
O–H, B–H, B–B, Si–H, as well as H–H
bonds.2 This novel bond activation mode
enables the environmentally benign, sustainable synthesis of numerous
important and useful chemicals from simple starting materials. However,
in most of those reactions, complexes of precious metals are used.
Currently, there is growing research interest in the development of
catalytic reactions based on complexes of Earth-abundant metals.3 In 2016, our group reported the manganese-catalyzed
acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines to aldimines.4a Seminal works employing manganese-based pincer
complexes were subsequently disclosed by the groups of Beller, Kempe,
Kirchner, and others, including the dehydrogenation of alcohols4b−4e,5 and hydrogenation of ketones,6 esters,4f,7 and C–N bond
hydrogenolysis of amides,8 as well as conjugate
addition of nonactivated nitriles.4g

Amine skeletons are prevalent in many biologically important natural
products, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals. They also serve as versatile
building blocks in organic synthesis, which can be easily elaborated
into various fine and useful complex molecules.9 In addition, amines are widely used as dyes, surfactants,
anticorrosive agents, detergents in industrial production.9 Given the importance of amine compounds, the
development of effective protocols for their synthesis is highly desirable.
In this context, deoxygenative hydrogenation (reduction) of amides
(C–O bond cleavage) represents a straightforward method to
access the corresponding amines.10

Conventional methods for the deoxygenative reduction of amides
to amines are largely based on the use of (over)stoichiometric amounts
of reductants such as lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4),
silanes, or boranes.10 However, these methods
suffer from the hazardous reductive agents, tedious workup procedures,
and generation of a large amount of waste. To address these issues,
catalytic deoxygenative reduction of amides using hydrogen as the
terminal reductant, forming water, is ideal. The relatively low electrophilicity
of the amide carbonyl group and the competitive C–N bond cleavage
(deaminative reduction) make this transformation more challenging,
compared to the hydrogenation of aldehydes, ketones, and esters. While heterogeneously catalyzed deoxygenative reduction of amides
were reported,11 they were often stricken
with high pressure,11f−11i high temperature,11a,11b,11f,11g and poor selectivity.11a,11d,11e Only few reports of homogeneously
catalyzed reaction were disclosed during the past decade (Scheme 1a).12 Homogeneously catalyzed reactions are generally attractive,
because of potential high selectivity and being more amenable for
mechanistic understanding. In 2007, Cole-Hamilton and co-workers reported
a ruthenium-triphos complex-catalyzed hydrogenation of amides to primary
and secondary amines with good to excellent selectivities.12a,12b Later, the Klankermayer group synthesized a rationally designed
ruthenium-triphos η4-trimethylenemethane complex
and successfully applied it to the hydrogenation of lactams.12c Shortly after, similar ruthenium-based catalytic
systems were disclosed by the groups of Beller12d and Zhou,12e using Yb(OTf)3·H2O and BF3·OEt2 as the additives, respectively. In addition, the Zhou group also
described a selective deoxygenative hydrogenation of amides catalyzed
by an iridium pincer complex, where B(C6F5)3 was used as the Lewis acid additive.12f Despite these advances, all the above transformations are
using catalysts based on the precious metals ruthenium or iridium.
The development of novel methods for the deoxygenative hydrogenation
of amides without noble metals is of great importance.

Scheme 1 Transition-Metal-Catalyzed
Deoxygenative Hydrogenation of Amides
to Amines
As part of our ongoing
research program on sustainable homogeneous
catalysis, we herein report a more environmentally benign strategy
for the deoxygenative hydrogenation of amides catalyzed by a pincer
complex of Earth-abundant manganese (Scheme 1b). We envisioned that the dearomatized manganese
complex 1 could heterolytically split dihydrogen via
MLC, and the resulting manganese hydride will hydrogenate amides to
amines with the aid of a proper Lewis acid. To the best of our knowledge,
there has hitherto been no report on deoxygenative hydrogenation of
amides to amines homogeneously catalyzed by a complex of a base metal.

Our initial studies were focused on examining the feasibility of
the deoxygenative hydrogenation of N-phenylbenzamide
(2a) and optimization of the reaction conditions for
the application to various amides. Encouragingly, the hydrogenation
of 2a did indeed occur in the presence of the manganese
PNP complex Mn-I(5e) (5 mol %), tBuOK (6 mol %) and one equivalent of BPh3 under 50 bar H2 at 150 °C in m-xylene, to afford the desired product N-benzylaniline
(3a) in 53% GC yield after 72 h (Table 1, entry 1). The transformation is highly
selective and only trace amounts of the C–N bond cleavage products
aniline (<1%) and benzyl alcohol (<1%) were detected by GC (see
the Supporting Information for details).
Control experiments indicated that without manganese complex or Lewis
acid no hydrogenation reaction occurred (entries 2 and 3). Encouraged
by this promising result, we started to optimize the reaction conditions
to improve the conversion and yield. Two manganese PNNH complexes Mn-II(4c,4f) and Mn-III(4d) showed lower catalytic performance and produced
the product in 23% and 37% yield, respectively (entries 4 and 5).
Lowering the reaction temperatures led to dramatically decreased conversions
and yields (entries 6 and 7). Interestingly, both conversion and yield
were increased by using the stronger Lewis acid B(C6F5)3 as the additive (74% conversion and 63% yield,
entry 8). Further screening the solvents indicated that dioxane and
THF were not suitable reaction media, probably due to their coordination
to B(C6F5)3 (entries 9 and 10). Increasing
the Lewis acid loading to 1.5 equiv provided the best results: 95%
conversion and 89% isolated yield of product 3a (see
entry 11). Under shorter reaction time (48 h), the reaction efficiency
was slightly decreased (see entry 12).

g Reaction was performed for 48 h.

Next, we selected the conditions
of entry 11 to examine the generality
of this catalytic hydrogenation system by evaluating a variety of
amides. As highlighted in Table 2, benzamides bearing substituents of different electronic
nature on the N-phenyl group were applicable to this
reaction, and the corresponding secondary amines 3a-3f were obtained in good to excellent isolated yields (Table 2, entries 1–6).
The hydrogenation of N-benzyl-, cyclohexyl-, and
hexyl-benzamides in 2g–2i also proceeded
smoothly to give the desired products in good yields (68%–83%
yields, entries 7–9). Aliphatic N-phenyl amides
such as N-phenylacetamide (2j), N-phenylpropionamide (2k) and N-phenylisobutyramide (2l) were compatible with the optimal
conditions, furnishing the products 3j–3l in 52%–70% isolated yields (entries 10–12). Notably,
the lactams 2-pyrrolidinone (2m) and 2-piperidinone (2n) were also suitable substrates, and good results were observed
(entries 13 and 14). Deoxygenation of formamides resulted in low yields
(see the SI for details). In order to further
extend the substrate scope, we evaluated the reaction of the tertiary
amide 2o; deoxygenative hydrogenation also occurred to
give the fully aliphatic tertiary amine 3o, albeit in
lower conversion (47%) and yield (21%) (entry 15). Significantly,
all the reactions selectively gave the C–O bond cleavage products.

In order to get some insight into the mechanism of
this transformation,
we first treated complex Mn-I with 1.2 equiv of tBuOK at room temperature in THF, upon which
the transparent yellow solution immediately changed to a dark brown
homogeneous solution (Scheme 2b; see SI for details) and two
sharp AB doublets appeared at δ = 81.03 (2JP–P = 79.9 Hz) and 68.04 (2JP–P = 79.9 Hz) ppm in the 31P NMR (THF as the solvent), attributable to complex 1 (Scheme 2a).13 Recrystallization of 1 gave the new N2-bridged dinuclear manganese complex 5 (N2 is from the glovebox), the only example of
a dearomatized N2-bridged complex (Scheme 2a). The bond lengths of C6–C7 and
C27–C28 are 1.385 and 1.384 Å, respectively, which clearly
indicate double-bond characters.14

Scheme 2 (a) Dearomatization of Mn-I, Activation of H2 by Complex 1, and Related X-ray Crystal Structures
and (b) 31P NMR Spectra
On the other hand, upon treatment of the above reaction
mixture
with 1 atm dihydrogen, an orange solution was formed (Scheme 2b), generating the new hydride
complex 4, as indicated by the 31P{1H} NMR spectrum in THF, which exhibited a singlet at δ = 111.77
ppm (see the SI for details), and the 1H NMR spectrum exhibited a hydride resonance at δ =
−4.34 ppm (t, 2JP–H = 48.5 Hz). The IR spectrum of 4 showed two strong
absorption bands at 1878.4 (νasym) and 1804.0 cm–1 (νsym). The structure of complex 4 was further confirmed by X-ray crystal analysis.14 Importantly, when complex 4 was
employed as catalyst for the hydrogenation of amide 2a, full conversion was observed and the product 3a was
isolated in 91% yield (see Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Deoxygenative Hydrogenation of Amide 2a Catalyzed by
Complex 4
We also examined the manganese complex Mn-I catalyzed
hydrogenation of the imine N-benzylideneaniline 6.15 As shown in Table 3, the hydrogenation of 6 did occur under the above optimal hydrogenation conditions,
without Lewis acid, resulting in 60% conversion within 24 h and the
amine 3a was isolated in 51% yield (Table 3, entry 1). Prolonging the reaction
time to 72 h, the conversion was increased to 80% (entry 2). When
0.2 equiv of B(C6F5)3 was used, the
reaction reached 88% conversion within 48 h (entry 3). Increasing
the loading of B(C6F5)3 to 0.5 equiv,
100% conversion was recorded and the desired product was isolated
in 81% yield (entry 4). These results indicate that imine 6 could be an intermediate in the hydrogenation of amide 2a, and Lewis acid may also accelerate the hydrogenation of the imine.16

Based
on our experimental results and previous work, we propose
a possible reaction mechanism for the Mn-catalyzed deoxygenative hydrogenation
of amides. As we have shown, in the presence of tBuOK, the pincer complex Mn-I undergoes deprotonation
to give the dearomatized complex 1, which is very likely
the actual catalyst (Scheme 4). Subsequently, complex 1 heterolytically splits
dihydrogen by MLC, generating the aromatized complex 4. The carbonyl group of the Lewis acid activated amide 7 then may electrophilically attack the Mn–H moiety of the
coordinatively saturated 4 through an outer-sphere pathway,
leading to formation of the hemiaminal intermediate 9 via transition state 8.17 Later, the Lewis-acid-assisted dehydration of 9 occurs
to produce imine 6, accompanied by the regeneration of
the dearomatized complex 1.18 Once imine 6 is formed, it may react with the hydride
complex 4 to afford intermediate 11 through
transition state 10 via a similar outer-sphere process.16 At last, elimination of the desired product 3a from 11 releases the complex 1, which then re-enters the catalytic cycle.

Scheme 4 Proposed Reaction
Mechanism for Manganese-Catalyzed Deoxygenative
Hydrogenation of Amides to Amines
In conclusion, we have developed the first Earth-abundant-based
metal complex for homogeneously catalyzed deoxygenative hydrogenation
of amides to amines. This synthetically important, highly selective
C–O bond cleavage reaction is catalyzed by a dearomatized pincer
complex of manganese. A plausible catalytic cycle, involving metal–ligand
cooperation, is supported by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies,
stoichiometric reactions, X-ray crystallography, and isolation of
plausible intermediates. Further detailed mechanistic investigations
and applications of this methodology are underway in our laboratory,
and will be reported in due course.
