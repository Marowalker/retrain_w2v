2-Deoxyribose-5-phosphate
aldolase (DERA) catalyzes the reversible
conversion of acetaldehyde and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate into deoxyribose-5-phosphate.
DERA is used as a biocatalyst for the synthesis of drugs such as statins
and is a promising pharmaceutical target due to its involvement in
nucleotide catabolism. Despite previous biochemical studies suggesting
the catalytic importance of the C-terminal tyrosine residue found
in several bacterial DERAs, the structural and functional basis of
its participation in catalysis remains elusive because the electron
density for the last eight to nine residues (i.e., the C-terminal
tail) is absent in all available crystal structures. Using a combination
of NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations, we conclusively
show that the rarely studied C-terminal tail of E.
coli DERA (ecDERA) is intrinsically
disordered and exists in equilibrium between open and catalytically
relevant closed states, where the C-terminal tyrosine (Y259) enters
the active site. Nuclear Overhauser effect distance restraints, obtained
due to the presence of a substantial closed state population, were
used to derive the solution-state structure of the ecDERA closed state. Real-time NMR hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments
reveal that Y259 is required for efficiency of the proton abstraction
step of the catalytic reaction. Phosphate titration experiments show
that, in addition to the phosphate-binding residues located near the
active site, as observed in the available crystal structures, ecDERA contains previously unknown auxiliary phosphate-binding
residues on the C-terminal tail which could facilitate in orienting
Y259 in an optimal position for catalysis. Thus, we present significant
insights into the structural and mechanistic importance of the ecDERA C-terminal tail and illustrate the role of conformational
sampling in enzyme catalysis.

Introduction
The fundamental principle
of enzyme catalysis is the ability of
an enzyme to decrease the transition-state energy (or destabilize
the ground state) and thereby accelerate the chemical reactions which
would otherwise not occur on biologically relevant time scales.1−3 Enzymes are intrinsically dynamic, and the emerging consensus is
that conformational sampling plays a crucial role in enzyme catalysis.4−13 However, describing the direct link between protein motions and
enzymatic function remains challenging. Under native conditions, enzymes
sample various conformations separated by energy barriers that determine
the rates of exchange between these substates.10,14,15 It has been shown that some of the substates
sampled by enzymes in the absence of a substrate resemble the substrate-bound
state,6,16−19 thus demonstrating the importance
of conformational sampling in enzyme catalysis.9,20

2-Deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA, E.C. 4.1.2.4) is a class
I aldolase with a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel fold and
a highly conserved sequence in bacteria. In vivo, DERA catalyzes the
reversible conversion of acetaldehyde and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
(G3P) to generate deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dR5P)21,22 and provides key intermediates essential for different metabolic
pathways, e.g., glycolysis, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and nucleotide
catabolism.23 Therefore, DERA is considered
as a promising pharmaceutical target against human bacterial pathogens.24,25 In addition to this, DERA is unique in catalyzing the cross-aldol
condensation between two aldehydes and is utilized as an environmentally
friendly biocatalyst for the synthesis of drugs such as statins.26−28 However, the absence of a phosphate group from the substrate severely
curtails the catalytic efficiency of DERA,29 thereby restricting its use as an efficient biocatalyst to phosphorylated
aldehydes. Additionally, mutations of residues interacting with the
dR5P phosphate group have also been shown to drastically decrease
the activity of ecDERA.30 Several efforts have been made to re-engineer DERAs for accelerated
enzyme catalysis31 and acceptance of nonphosphorylated
substrates.32

On the basis of Escherichia coli DERA (ecDERA) crystal
structures with carbinolamine
and Schiff base intermediates, as well as site-directed mutagenesis,
Heine et al.33 have proposed a reaction
mechanism of the reversible conversion of acetaldehyde and G3P to
generate dR5P, which proceeds through a Schiff base formation with
the active site K167 residue (Scheme 1). After the formation of an imine, a proton relay
system composed of D102, K201, and a conserved water molecule facilitates
the abstraction of a C2 proton (i.e., a proton attached to carbon
adjacent to the aldehyde group), allowing the formation of an enamine.
The enamine further performs a nucleophilic attack onto the carbonyl
carbon of the acceptor aldehyde (G3P) to yield dR5P. The crystal structures
also reveal that, within the ecDERA active site,
the most important substrate coordinating residues are T18, D102,
K167, and T170, whereas residues G205 and S238 directly coordinate
the dR5P phosphate group, forming the major part of a phosphate-binding
site.33

Reaction of Acetaldehyde (Magenta)
and G3P (Green) Proceeding via a Schiff-Base Intermediate with K167,

In addition, D102, K201, and
a water molecule were proposed to act as an acid (A)/base (B) in a
proton relay system responsible for abstracting a C2 proton (highlighted
in boldface).33

Despite several biochemical studies suggesting that the C-terminal
tyrosine (i.e., Y259) is crucial for efficient catalysis of dR5P breakdown,33,34 the absence of electron density for the last eight C-terminal residues
(residues D252–Y259 in ecDERA: i.e., the C-terminal
tail) in all available crystal structures of DERAs containing a C-terminal
tyrosine (including ecDERA)24,32,33,35,36 has precluded acquiring insights into the role of
the tyrosine as well as the C-terminal tail. As observed in ecDERA, the C-terminal tyrosine residue of class I rabbit
muscle fructose-1,6-disphosphate aldolase (FBPA) is important for
the catalysis of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) breakdown. Unlike ecDERA, however, crystal structures of FBPA reveal that,
upon binding DHAP, the phosphate dianion recruits the disordered C-terminal
region to the active site.37

To investigate
the structural and functional basis of Y259 in the ecDERA catalytic mechanism, we have carried out a combined
molecular dynamics (MD) and NMR spectroscopy study on its monomeric
variant, DERAm (carrying K58E and Y96W mutations).32,36 Since the high molecular weight (56 kDa) of the dimeric wild-type ecDERA makes acquiring atomic-resolution NMR structural
and dynamic information challenging, we chose DERAm, which has been
shown to have a nearly identical tertiary structure and exhibits enzymatic
activity similar to that of the dimeric ecDERA.32 In this study, we show that the C-terminal tail
is flexible in solution and provide the first direct structural evidence
that, in the absence of the substrate, it samples several substates
including a catalytically relevant conformation where Y259 is located
inside the active site (i.e., the closed state). We present the solution-state
structure of the catalytically relevant closed state, derived using
NOE distance restraints, in the substrate-free form of DERAm. We further
reveal that, in the closed state conformation, the Y259 ηOH group is responsible for efficient substrate C2 proton exchange
and, therefore, could enable a fast transition from the imine to enamine
intermediates. Chemical shift perturbations with potassium phosphate
reveal that ecDERA contains two distinct sets of
phosphate-binding residues: the main phosphate-binding residues near
the active site as observed from the reaction-intermediate bound crystal
structures33 and previously unknown auxiliary
phosphate-binding residues on the C-terminal tail, which could aid
in stabilizing the catalytically active conformation of Y259. Thus,
our data provide novel insights into DERA function and highlight the
role of conformational sampling in the catalysis of dR5P breakdown.

Experimental
Section
Protein Expression and Purification
Cloning of the
DERAm construct was performed as described previously.38 Y259F, S257D/S258D, and the C-terminal tail
deletion mutant of DERAm, D252stop (where the new C-terminal residue
is G251), were generated with the QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Agilent Technologies, Düsseldorf-Ratingen, Germany) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions using the primers given
in Table S1. The recombinant protein production
and purification were carried out as described previously.38

Activity Assay
Enzyme activity was
determined at 20
°C in a retro-aldol reaction with 0.02–5.0 mM dR5P in
50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8) using a coupled enzyme assay as described
previously.32,39 In this assay, the G3P generated
in the DERA-catalyzed retro-aldol reaction is isomerized to DHAP by
triosephosphate isomerase. DHAP is further reduced to glycerol-3-phosphate
by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase through the oxidation of NADH
(Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany). The decrease in NADH
concentration was monitored at 340 nm.

NMR Experiments
[U-13C,15N] and
[U-15N] DERAm and its mutants were prepared in 50 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 6.8), unless stated otherwise, 0.03% (w/v) NaN3, and 1 mM 2,2,3,3-d(4)-3-(tetramethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium
salt (TMSP, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany) in a 90%/10%
(v/v) H2O/D2O mixture. The protein concentration
was 800 μM. The NMR spectra were recorded on spectrometers operating
at proton frequencies of 600, 800, and 900 MHz, equipped with cryogenically
cooled z-gradient probes, and at 25 °C. The sample temperature
was calibrated using a perdeuterated methanol sample as described
by Findeisen et al.401H, 13C, and 15N backbone and side chain resonance assignments
for DERAm were published previously (BMRB entry: 27048).38 The backbone assignments for DERAm mutants were
confirmed using standard multidimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments.41 Spectra were processed using the NMRPipe package42 and analyzed with CcpNMR Analysis.43

{1H}-15N Heteronuclear
NOE
{1H}15N NOE values for DERAm in
50 mM HEPES (pH 6.8)
at 25 °C were derived from pairs of interleaved spectra recorded
with (NOE) and without (reference) proton saturation during the recycle
delay. A recycle delay of 14 s was used at 14.1 T. The {1H}15N NOE values were calculated from peak intensity ratios
obtained from the NOE and reference spectra, with uncertainties estimated
from background noise of the spectra.

Solvent Paramagnetic Relaxation
Enhancement (sPRE)
2D 1H–15N
HSQC spectra of DERAm and
the Y259F mutant (300 μM each) in 50 mM HEPES (pH 6.8) at 25
°C were recorded in the presence of 0.5 and 1.0 mM [Gd(DTPA-BMA)]44 and in the absence of the paramagnetic agent.
The HSQC spectra were recorded with 1024* × 140* complex data
in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively,
with acquisition times of 106.5 ms (tHN) and 67.7 ms (tN). The recycle delay
was 5 s, and 16 scans were collected over 6.5 h per experiment. The
experiment was performed in duplicate. The ratio of peak intensities
in the presence and absence of the paramagnetic agent (Ipara/Idia) was used to qualitatively
assess the solvent accessibility for DERAm and the Y259F mutant.

NMR Structure Calculation
All NOESY-HSQC experiments
were recorded at 800 MHz and 25 °C. Distance restraints were
obtained from 13C- and 15N-edited NOESY spectra
recorded with mixing times of 100–110 ms.

The NOE distance
restraint derived structural ensemble of DERAm closed state conformation
was calculated starting from the crystal structure (PDB ID: 5EKY).32 Residues missing from the crystal structure (i.e., N-terminal
M1–T2 and C-terminal D252–Y259) were added with Swiss-PdbViewer
4.1.0,45 and hydrogen atoms were added
with NIH version 1.2.1 of X-PLOR 3.851 (XPLOR-NIH 1.2.1).46,47 Structure preparation was followed by 1000 steps of Powell minimization48 based on the bond geometry parameter file parallhdg.pro
modified as described previously49 with
harmonic restraints to keep the heavy atoms as close to the crystal
structure as possible (atomic RMSDs of 0.28 Å for the backbone
and 0.37 Å for all heavy atoms) while reducing the deviation
from the ideal covalent geometry of the force field used for the subsequent
structure calculation. The resulting heavy-atom positions of residues
D3–H250 were kept fixed, except for the side chains of L245,
K246, and H250 and the carbonyl group of H250. The closed conformation
of the C-terminal region was determined from 48 unambiguous medium-
to long-range distance restraints derived from the three-dimensional
NOESY spectra in an iterative procedure. The NOEs were manually classified
into medium (<3.8 Å) and long (<5.3 Å) distance restraints
on the basis of their corresponding cross peak volumes, i.e., medium
and weak. Intra-residual, sequential, and possibly also medium-range
NOE cross-peaks in the highly mobile C-terminal region are expected
to contain significant contributions from conformations other than
the closed state conformation and were therefore not included in the
structure calculation. These experimental restraints served as an
input for the calculation of 120 structures using restrained molecular
dynamics according to a three-stage simulated annealing protocol50 using floating assignment of prochiral groups51 with XPLOR-NIH 1.2.1,46,47 as described previously.52 The Gaussian
conformational database potential53 with
a cutoff of 10.0 standard deviations54 was
included in the target function in order to improve the stereochemical
properties. The 26 structures showing the lowest energy values (excluding
conformational database potential) and fewest distance restraint violations
were selected for further characterization using XPLOR-NIH 1.2.146,47 and PROCHECK-NMR 3.4.55

Chemical
Shift Perturbation Analysis
Potassium phosphate
(KPi) at concentrations ranging from 0 to 150 mM was titrated
against 800 μM DERAm and the Y259F, D252stop, and S257D/S258D
mutants in 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.8) to obtain the affinity toward
inorganic phosphate. 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra
for each titration point were recorded at 25 °C and 600 MHz (DERAm
and the S257D/S258D and D252stop mutants) and 800 MHz (Y259F mutant).
The data matrix of the 2D 1H–15N HSQC
at 600 MHz consisted of 160* × 1024* complex data points with
acquisition times of 77.5 ms (tN) and
107 ms (tHN) and 160* × 832* data
points and 59 ms (tN) and 64.5 ms (tHN) at 800 MHz. Sixteen scans per titration
point were collected with a recycle delay of 1.3 s. The total measuring
time was 2 h per 2D 1H–15N HSQC experiment.
The equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, was obtained from changes in the weighted average chemical shift
differences Δδav = [(Δδ2HN + Δδ2N/25)/2]1/2 assuming a two-state model56 1  where [P0] is the
total protein concentration and X is the molar ratio
of ligand to protein. In total, chemical shift changes for 21 residues
were used to report the average KD values
for DERAm and the Y259F mutant and 16 residues for the D252stop mutant,
whereas 23 residues could be used for the S257D/S258D mutant to describe
the respective affinities toward Pi.

1D 1H Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange Experiments
A 200 mM solution
of propanal (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich,
Germany) was incubated in 50 mM potassium phosphate in degassed D2O (pD 6.8) with 0.5 mM TMSP. In aqueous solution propanal
exists in equilibrium with its hydrate, propane-1,1-diol. The chemical
shift assignments of the 1D 1H spectrum of propanal were
confirmed using a 2D 1H–1H COSY spectrum.
A reference sample without DERA was recorded as time point t = 0. After addition of 5 μM DERAm to the reaction
mixture, 1D 1H spectra were recorded with a relaxation
delay of 20 s, 16384 data points, a spectral width of 9579 Hz, and
four scans resulting in 128 s per experiment. A series of 1D spectra
was recorded for 3 h. In another experiment, upon the addition of
5 μM Y259F mutant, 1D 1H spectra were recorded using
the same acquisition parameters with 32 scans and resulting in 13
min 57 s per 1D experiment, over a period of 4 days. Peak heights
were extracted using NMRDraw.42 To quantify
the rate of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange of the C2 proton, the
collapse of the triplet representing the methyl group of propanal
at 1.06 ppm (t, 3JH–H = 7.3 Hz) and propane-1,1-diol at 0.91 ppm (t, 3JH–H = 7.5) to a doublet (with coupling
constants of d, 3JH–H = 7.4 Hz for propanal and d, 3JH–H = 7.6 Hz for propane-1,1-diol) was monitored and
the ratio of the upfield peak and the downfield peak of each triplicate
was plotted as a function of time. The intensity ratios could be fit
to the monoexponential equation 2  with R0 = 1/τ
where y is the intensity ratio, y0 is the intensity ratio of the reference (without DERA)
representing t = 0, R0 is the rate and τ is the time constant describing the H/D
exchange kinetics. The fitting was performed using OriginPro 8.5G
(OriginLab Corporation, Friedrichsdorf, Germany).

1D 31P NMR Experiments
1D 31P
NMR spectra of 50 mM KPi (pH 6.8) with 800 μM DERAm
and its mutants were recorded on a Bruker Avance III HD with a Prodigy
cryoprobe at 600 MHz and 25 °C with 16384* complex data points
and an acquisition time of 672.8 ms and 86161 scans with an experimental
time of 27.5 h per experiment.

MD Simulations
System Setup
The crystal structure of DERAm (PDB ID: 5EKY),32 resolved
at 1.1 Å resolution, was used as the starting
structure for MD simulations. As this structure contains several unassigned
residues due to the absence of electron density (i.e., N-terminal
M1–T2 and C-terminal D252–Y259), we used the MODELER
9.14 tool57 to prepare the full-length
protein structure. A model where the C-terminus is positioned laterally
to the TIM barrel was selected (K167–Y259 distance of ∼26
Å).

For MD simulations, GROMACS 5.1 suite58,59 was used. The protein was represented with the Amber 99SB*-ILDN
force field60−62 in combination with the explicit TIP3P water model.63 For titratable residues, the protonation states
were assigned to a pH of 6.8, on the basis of the PROPKA 3 estimate.64 The protein was centered in a cubic box, at
least 15 Å away from any edge. A larger than usual box size was
used so that the flexible C-terminus does not come in contact with
the periodic image even in the extended state. The simulation box
was filled with ∼22000 water molecules, and the charge was
neutralized with Na+ ions. The steepest descent algorithm
was used to minimize the system (maximal force of 500 kJ mol–1 nm–1) before equilibrations. In NVT equilibration,
the system was heated to 298 K (v-rescale thermostat65) and equilibrated for 200 ps. At this stage, positional
restraints were applied to all protein atoms (force constant of 1000
kJ mol–1 nm–2). During 2.5 ns
NPT equilibration, the restraints were gradually reduced from 1000
to 5 kJ mol–1 nm–2, while the
pressure was kept at 1 bar (Berendsen barostat66).

The system was modeled under periodic boundary
conditions, and
the particle mesh Ewald method67 was used
to treat electrostatic interactions. The short-range nonbonded interactions
were calculated under the cutoff of 10 Å. All bonds were constrained
using the LINCS algorithm.68 An integration
step of 2.0 fs was used.

HREX-MD Simulation
The Hamiltonian
replica exchange
(HREX)-MD was performed in GROMACS patched with the Plumed 2.3 plugin.69,70 Twelve replicas were simulated, where the Hamiltonian affecting
the C-terminus and several loops over the active site were scaled
(i.e., residues 19–25, 75–82, 168–178, 202–208,
249–259). The Hamiltonian scaling factors were 1.00, 0.95,
0.91, 0.87, 0.83, 0.79, 0.76, 0.72, 0.69, 0.66, 0.63, and 0.60, which
corresponds to the temperature range of 298–497 K. The exchanges
between replicas were attempted every 4 ps, leading to an exchange
acceptance rate of ∼30%. Production HREX-MD simulation was
carried out with the NPT ensemble (v-rescale thermostat and the Parrinello–Rahman
barostat71). Each replica was simulated
for 220 ns (accumulated sampling time of 2.64 μs), with coordinates
of the system collected every 5 ps. The replica with the unperturbed
Hamiltonian (i.e., scaling factor of 1.00) was used for the analysis.

MD Simulations
A set of 120 frames, where Y259 was
observed in the active site (distance between K167 ζN and Y259 ηO < 6 Å) was selected from HREX-MD.
From each frame, an unrestrained MD simulation was set up. The water
box was reduced to at least 10 Å away from any edge, while preserving
the cubic shape. The system was minimized and equilibrated as initially
described. Production MD simulations were 50 ns long, providing a
total of 6 μs of sampling, and coordinates of the system were
saved every 20 ps.

Structural Analysis
The analysis
of MD trajectories
was performed using GROMACS tools and the MDTraj library.72 Hydrogen bonds were identified according to
the Baker–Hubbard criteria,73 i.e.,
where the H···acceptor distance was shorter than 2.5
Å and the donor–H···acceptor angle was
greater than 120°, in at least 30% of frames. For the identification
of the hydrophobic contacts between residues, all side chain C atoms
not directly bound to a heteroatom were considered. Given a residue
pair, a hydrophobic contact was defined if the shortest distance between
the two residues was lower than 4.5 Å, in at least 30% of the
frames.

Results
Efficient Catalysis by ecDERA Requires Y259 ηOH
The ecDERA reaction mechanism,
proposed by Heine et al.,33 describes the
reversible conversion of acetaldehyde and G3P to dR5P, through a Schiff-base
intermediate with the catalytic K167. Several studies have indicated
that the side chain hydroxyl group of the C-terminal tyrosine is crucial
for DERA catalysis33,34 and the Y259F mutation results
in a reduction in the catalytic activity of 2 orders of magnitude.33 Similarly, the DERAm variant, used in our study,
shows an ∼100-fold decrease in the kinetic rate constant due
to the Y259F mutation (kcat, Table 1), further highlighting
the importance of this residue in the catalytic mechanism.

C-Terminal Tail of DERAm Is Flexible in Solution
and Transiently
Occupies the Active Site
In all the available crystal structures
of DERAs containing a C-terminal tyrosine,24,32,33,35,36,74 the electron density
for the C-terminal tail is poorly defined, which prevents understanding
the structural and functional basis of the participation of Y259 in
catalysis. To characterize the dynamics of the C-terminal tail in
solution, we acquired {1H}15N heteronuclear
NOE (hetNOE) values for DERAm. The hetNOE values, obtained for 204
out of total 251 nonproline residues, suggest that the TIM-barrel
fold of DERAm (residues 2–250) is rigid on the picosecond to
nanosecond time scale with only G205 and D147 showing hetNOE values
lower than 0.65 (Figure 1A). The C-terminal tail shows hetNOE values consistently lower than
0.65, indicating high flexibility in solution, which explains the
lack of well-defined electron density in the crystal structures.

elements is shown at the top. Residues in the C-terminal tail are
highlighted in yellow.

Many recent experimental and computational studies have shown
that,
under native conditions, enzymes have an intrinsic ability to sample
open and closed forms in the absence of a substrate.9,20,75,76 Upon substrate binding one of these conformations gets stabilized
through local rearrangements.20 For the
possible participation of DERAm Y259 in the enzymatic reaction, it
is plausible that the C-terminal tail would need to sample conformations
which allow Y259 to enter the active site (closed state). However,
for the substrate binding and product release, the enzyme should preferentially
be in a conformation that does not block the active site (i.e., open
state). A highly flexible C-terminal tail of DERA leads potentially
to many open states which would have higher solvent accessibility
in comparison to the closed conformation. Paramagnetic relaxation
enhancements, induced using soluble paramagnetic compounds (sPREs),
provide a straightforward approach toward structural and dynamic analysis
of biomolecules using solvent accessibilities.77−79 sPREs have
been used to detect transiently populated conformers and changes in
the solvent accessibilities of intrinsically disordered regions of
proteins.80,81

In our study, we used sPREs of the
backbone amide group, with [Gd(DTPA-DMA)]
as a paramagnetic agent, to assess the solvent accessibility of DERAm.
Intensity ratios (Ipara/Idia) of resonances in 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra recorded with (0.5 mM and 1.0 mM [Gd(DTPA-DMA)]) and
without the paramagnetic solvent indicate that several loop regions
(N21–E26, A93–A98, E115–V117, G224, A225, A230,
R231) and the N-terminus of helix 3 (residues Y49–I53) are
the most surface exposed regions of the protein (Figure 1B). In contrast, the flexible
C-terminal tail shows significantly higher Ipara/Idia values in comparison
with the aforementioned surface-exposed residues. These observations
indicate that the C-terminal tail may sample conformations with low
solvent-accessible surface area: e.g., a closed state.

To investigate
the possibility of the C-terminal tail adopting
a closed state, thereby allowing Y259 to enter the active site, we
recorded 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of DERAm
Y259F mutant. A quantitative analysis of the backbone amide chemical
shift differences between DERAm and the Y259F mutant revealed that
most of the significant chemical shift changes (i.e., Δδav > 0.015 ppm) occurred to residues located within the
DERAm
active site (i.e., T18, L20, T168, T170, G171, A203, G204, G205, and
R207) (Figure 2). These
residues have been shown to be crucial for DERA–substrate interaction.33 The observed perturbations demonstrate that
the flexible C-terminal tail of DERAm can sample the closed conformation,
thereby bringing Y259 into the active site, in the absence of the
substrate. Additionally, the Ipara/Idia ratios between DERAm and the Y259F mutant
in the presence of 1 mM [Gd(DTPA-DMA)] are nearly identical with each
other (Figure S2). This indicates that
the absence of the ηOH group of Y259 does not result
in large scale conformational changes and the aforementioned chemical
shift perturbations arise primarily due to the absence of the Y259
side chain hydroxyl group.

MD Simulations Suggest That the Closed State Is Stabilized by
a Weak-Interaction Network
The inability to resolve the conformation
of the C-terminal tail of ecDERA from X-ray crystallography32,33,35 was at the origin of an idea
that the tail is intrinsically disordered and samples many states.33,35 However, the early kinetic investigation pointed out the crucial
role of the C-terminus for catalysis by DERA (Table 1). Although the C-terminus is long enough
to extend and protrude into the active site,33 no structure of such a conformation is available. To understand
the closed conformation of DERA, where Y259 is in the active site,
we explored the conformational ensemble of DERAm using enhanced sampling
HREX-MD simulations. We recently demonstrated how HREX-MD can be used
to study conformational ensembles of enzyme active sites10 and here present the sampling on a larger scale.
To that extent, we enhanced the sampling of the C-terminal tail together
with the loops on the catalytic face. While the secondary structure
elements of the TIM (α/β)8 barrel fold remain
stable during 220 ns of HREX-MD (RMSD value of 2 Å from the initial
structure), the complete protein backbone indicates much more dynamics
(RMSD of up to 6 Å, Figure S3) which
comes from the highly flexible C-terminal tail.

To analyze if
the C-terminus protrudes into the active site, we measured the distance
between the catalytic K167 and C-terminal Y259 residue. Figure S4 shows that the C-terminal tail of DERAm
explores a wide range of conformations. While there are multiple open
states which present the majority of the complete conformational ensemble,
a low closed-state population was identified where the K167–Y259
distance was shorter than 6 Å (Figure S4A). In the open states, the C-terminal tail samples a wide range of
conformations, as indicated by structures representing maxima on the
distance distribution plot (Figure S4B).
The high relative free energy of the closed state, in comparison to
the open states, leads to a low occurrence of this state in the HREX-MD
simulations. To further sample the closed state, we performed an additional 6 μs of MD (120 simulations starting from different
closed state frames identified in the HREX-MD, each 50 ns long). Figure S5A shows that a much higher number of
the closed state conformations were sampled, which allowed us to investigate
the interactions that stabilize this state.

We used the complete
closed state ensemble, identified with MD
(around 80000 structures), to investigate the noncovalent interactions
in the closed state, which we roughly divide into polar (Figure 3A) and hydrophobic
(Figure 3B). However,
as the C-terminal tail was found to open in each of the 120 closed
state simulations (Figure S5B), these stabilizing
interactions are only transient.

Figure 3 Transient noncovalent interactions stabilize
the closed state conformation.
(A) Polar and (B) hydrophobic interactions stabilize the C-terminal
tail in the closed state conformation. The side chain of the catalytic
K167 is highlighted in dark gray. (a1) The hydrophobic interaction
between the K172 side chain and the aromatic ring of Y259 as well
as the salt bridge between the K172 ζN-group and
the C-terminal COO– group. (a2) Hydrogen bonds between
A256 and G253 backbone as well as S255 N to Q35 εO. (b1) The C-terminal tyrosine Y259 is further stabilized through
hydrophobic interactions with T18 and L20. (b2) Residues A256 and
D252 have hydrophobic interactions with residues L241 and A242 located
at the C-terminal helix 10.

The hydrophobic contacts are defined here based on the proximity
of nonpolar C atoms in any residue pair, i.e., below the cutoff of
4.5 Å. The distance distributions for hydrophobic contacts are
shown in Figure S6. These interactions,
stabilizing the closed conformation of the C-terminal tail of DERAm,
could be split into two groups: those stabilizing N-terminal half
of the tail and those stabilizing Y259 in the active site. The former
group involves a particularly complex network of contacts through
the aliphatic side chain of L248, K5, L9, L12, and V40, which seems
to tether the C-terminal helix 10 (S239–L248 in PDB ID: 5EKY) with the rest of
the protein. L245, located on the helix 10, forms contacts with residues
H250 and D252 on the tail (Figure S6L,M). D252 also forms contacts with A242, and A256 is further in contact
with L241 and A242, both located on the helix 10 (Figure 3b2). Y259 forms an extensive
network of hydrophobic contacts with aliphatic side chains of residues
located in the active site: i.e., T18, L20, and K172 (Figure 3a1,b1).

Polar interactions
were further split into salt bridges and hydrogen
bonds (Figure S7). Only one salt bridge
was identified in the closed state, between K172, located on the loop
over the active site, and the Y259 C-terminal COO– group (Figure 3a1
and Figure S7A). Furthermore, several hydrogen
bonds were identified between the C-terminal tail and the protein
core (i.e., G249–K246, H250–L245, and S255–Q35, Figure S7B–D) and also within the tail
itself (A256–G253, S257–K254, and S258–S255, Figure S7E–G). However, the last three
hydrogen bonds observed in the C-terminal tail (i.e., residues 253–258)
are rarely present simultaneously, appearing together only in 5% of
the total closed state ensemble, whereas at least one of the three
is present in more than 70% of the sampled conformations.

NOE-Derived
NMR Structure of the Closed State
The classical
MD simulations indicate that the closed state of the DERAm C-terminal
tail gets stabilized through a range of hydrophobic interactions with
residues in the C-terminal helix 10 (Figure 3A,b1,b2). To verify the closed state structural
representation and confirm the MD-observed interactions that stabilize
the closed state in solution, we recorded a 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the D252stop mutant. A quantitative analysis
of the backbone amide chemical shift differences between DERAm and
the D252stop mutant revealed that most of the significant chemical
shift changes (i.e., Δδav > 0.038 ppm) occurred
not only to residues located around the active site but also to residues
located in the helix 10 (A242, S243, L244, L245, and K246) (Figure S8). These chemical shift changes coincide
with the hydrophobic contacts observed from the MD simulations. Therefore,
we recorded NOESY spectra in an attempt to obtain distance restraints
between the C-terminal tail and rest of the protein.

Analyses
of the NOESY spectra revealed the presence of an unambiguous NOE network
between residues in the C-terminal tail and the rest of the protein:
in particular, the active site (Figure 4). Although the hetNOE values and TALOS-N secondary
structure prediction, using NMR chemical shifts,38 show conclusively that the C-terminal tail is disordered
in solution (Figure 1A), the presence of NOEs indicates that the closed conformations
of the C-terminal tail could nevertheless be populated in the conformational
equilibrium for a substantial fraction of the time. Owing to the steep r–6 dependence of the NOE intensity on
the interproton distance, r, long-range contacts
are expected to give rise to detectable NOE cross-peaks even if these
contacts are only transiently populated for a fraction of the NOESY
mixing time used.82

tail closed state. (A) A set of 48 NOEs satisfies the closed state
ensemble. The inset shows that the presence of Y259 inside the active
site is supported by NOEs (dashed lines) to nearby residues. Strips

interactions for 259 Hδ* (B), 259 Hε* (C), and 18 Hγ2* (D) protons. Weak NOE between
259 Hδ* and 20 Hδ1* is highlighted
by a black circle in (B). 13C chemical shifts for 259 Cδ*, 259 Cε*, and 18 Cγ2* are displayed at the top of the NOESY strips in (B)–(D),
respectively.

We used a total of 48
unambiguous NOE distance restraints (Table S2), between the residues in the C-terminal
tail and the rest of the protein (i.e., helix 10 and active site),
for the calculation of an ensemble of 26 structures representing the
closed state of DERAm (Figure 4A), which is provided as a PDB file in the Supporting Information. Each of these 26 structures individually
satisfies the full set of 48 distance restraints without seriously
violating the stereochemical quality. None of the C-terminal tail
residues lie in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot, and
only S257 and S258 are in the generously allowed region.

The
contribution of the distance restraints to the target function
was 0.43 ± 0.29 kcal mol–1, the root-mean-square
deviation from the distance restraints was 0.013 ± 0.004 Å,
and no distance restraint was violated by more than 0.12 Å. The
transient presence of Y259 in the active site is conclusively supported
by an extensive network of NOEs between the Y259 side chain and residues
in the active site (Figure 4A inset). A comparison of inter-residue cross-peak intensities
of NOEs between Y259 and other active site residues (Figure 4B–D) indicates that
the ε atoms of Y259 protrude more deeply in the active site
than the δ groups. The distance between the side chain amino
group of the active site K167 and the ηOH group of
Y259 in the NMR ensemble was 4.3 ± 0.5 Å (n = 26), in support of the observations made by the MD simulations.
The population of the closed state represented by the calculated NMR
structure was estimated to be ∼13% from intensities of NOEs
between L20 Hδ1* and Y259 Hε*. To
estimate the population, we assumed that in open states the contribution
to the NOE intensity is zero due to larger interproton distances.
The interproton distances were averaged with r–6 weighting, and intra-residue NOE between L20 Hδ1* and L20 Hα was used as an internal
distance reference.

It is important to note that although the
NMR ensemble satisfies
all 48 experimentally derived distance restraints and exhibits structural
features very similar to those observed in the MD simulations, this
closed state represents only a small—albeit significant—fraction
of the full conformational ensemble sampled by the intrinsically disordered
C-terminal tail. Moreover, our MD simulations point out that not all
stabilizing interactions are simultaneously required to maintain the
DERAm closed state: i.e., to keep Y259 inside the active site. This
is also illustrated by fluctuations of the distance between the side
chain amino group of the active site K167 and the hydroxyl group of
Y259 in the apoenzyme (Figure S5). Therefore,
due to the flexible nature of the C-terminal tail, we cannot rule
out the existence of a more diverse closed state conformational ensemble
in comparison to that calculated using our limited unambiguous NOE
data.

Y259 Facilitates C2 Proton Exchange in Propanal
The
importance of the Y259 ηOH group in the ecDERA catalytic reaction is highlighted by an ∼100-fold reduction
in the kcat value reported herein (Table 1) and in previous
studies.33,34 To understand the role of the Y259 ηOH group, we monitored the real-time H/D exchange of
the C2 proton of propanal in the presence of DERAm and the Y259F mutant
using 1D 1H NMR in D2O and KPi buffer
(Figure 5A). Propanal
was chosen over acetaldehyde (natural substrate) because the latter
can react in a sequential manner to form side products which covalently
attach to and inactivate ecDERA.32 For monitoring of the C2 deprotonation, the transformation
of the methyl group of both propanal and its hydrate, propane-1,1-diol,
from a triplet into a doublet was monitored over time. The addition
of DERAm leads to an immediate decrease in the intensity of the downfield
resonance of the methyl group triplet and a simultaneous increase
in the upfield resonance (Figure 5B), signifying exchange of a C2 proton with a deuterium.
Fitting the change in the intensity ratio of the upfield and downfield
peaks to a monoexponential equation (eq 2) yielded a time constant (τ) of 19.7 ±
2.5 min for DERAm-catalyzed C2 deprotonation (Figure 5C). However, the change in the aforementioned
intensity ratio in the presence of the Y259F mutant was observed to
be significantly slower, with the fits yielding a time constant of
62.7 ± 5.9 h (Figure 5D), ∼190-fold higher than τDERAm.
This drastic increase in τ indicates that the C2 proton abstraction
is significantly more efficient in the presence of the Y259 side chain
hydroxyl group than in its absence.

presence of DERAm and the Y259F mutant studied with 1D proton NMR

was fit to a single-exponential equation in the presence of 5 μM
DERAm (C) and 5 μM Y259F mutant (D), respectively. The errors
in (C) and (D) were estimated from triplicate measurements.

C-Terminal Tail Contains
Auxiliary Phosphate-Binding Residues
The catalytic efficiency
of ecDERA is severely
reduced for nonphosphorylated substrates. The kcat value is 68 ± 1 s–1 with dR5P as
the acceptor, whereas it decreases by a factor of ∼600 to 0.11
± 0.01 s–1 when deoxyribose (dR) is used as
the acceptor aldehyde.29 A strong increase
in KM from 0.64 mM (dR5P) to 57.7 mM (dR)
suggests that the phosphate group is vital for the enzyme–substrate
interaction. Additionally, under our reaction conditions, we could
not detect any catalytic activity for DERAm toward dR.

Considering
that the phosphate group is crucial for enzyme–substrate interaction,
we investigated the interaction between DERAm and phosphate using
2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra recorded at different
phosphate concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 100 mM KPi (Figure 6A). As expected,
the main phosphate-binding residues in the vicinity of the active
site identified by X-ray crystallography (i.e., T18, L20, T170, G171,
G204, G205, and A237)33 show significant
chemical shift changes upon titration of KPi. Residues
undergoing fast to intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale were
used to extract KD values (eq 1). The chemical shift changes for
16 residues in DERAm (Table S3) were used
to calculate an average KD value of 18.8
± 3.6 mM for the main phosphate-binding residues. Additionally,
several residues on the C-terminal tail showed chemical shift changes
upon interaction with phosphate. The average KD value for these auxiliary phosphate-binding residues was
19.0 ± 0.7 mM (n = 5, Table S3), nearly identical with that for the main set of residues.
The 31P NMR spectrum, recorded on DERAm variant in 50 mM
KPi buffer (pH 6.8), shows the presence of one additional
phosphate resonance in addition to the buffer resonance. This observation
indicates that both binding sites may simultaneously coordinate the
same molecule of inorganic phosphate (Figure S9).

Figure 6 Phosphate-binding sites in DERAm. (A) Overlay of 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of DERAm recorded in the presence
of KPi ranging from 0 mM to 100 mM. The main and auxiliary
phosphate-binding residues show significant changes in backbone amide
chemical shift. In addition to chemical shift changes for various
residues, extensive changes in line widths are observed. (B) Residues
showing significant chemical shift changes upon addition of KPi are highlighted (magenta, main; cyan, auxiliary) on a model
of the DERAm closed state. The catalytic K167 side chain is shown
in a ball and stick representation.

To identify the key C-terminal tail auxiliary phosphate-binding
residues, we carried out 1H–15N HSQC
titration of KPi with 15N-labeled DERAm mutants:
Y259F and S257D/S258D. The affinity toward Pi for the main
and auxiliary binding residues in the Y259F mutant were 17.9 ±
2.4 mM (n = 16) and 19.3 ± 0.4 mM (n = 5), respectively. The near-identical affinities for both sets
of binding residues, as well as those to the corresponding binding
sites in DERAm, indicate that the Y259 ηOH group
does not play any role in phosphate coordination. This is supported
by the presence of a single protein-bound phosphate resonance in the 31P NMR spectrum, which has a chemical shift identical with
that of the bound phosphate resonance in the 31P spectrum
of DERAm variant (Figure S9).

For
the S257D/S258D mutant, 2D 1H–15N HSQC
spectra were recorded with KPi concentrations ranging
from 0 to 150 mM, in anticipation of the decreased phosphate affinity
due to the presence of negatively charged aspartic
acid residues. Residues Y259 and A256, flanking the mutation site,
show a decrease in Pi affinity by more than 200%, whereas
residues D258, G253, L241, A237, and T208 show an affinity decrease
of more than 100% in comparison to their respective affinities in
DERAm and the Y259F mutant (Table S3).
The remaining residues used for KD determination
located around the active site (i.e., D16, T18, L20, T170, N176, A177,
A203, G204, G205, and R207) show a decrease in affinity between 47
and 87% (Table S3). Additionally, a 31P NMR spectrum recorded on the S257D/S258D mutant shows a
single protein-bound phosphate resonance which has a distinct chemical
shift in comparison with the bound phosphate resonance observed in 31P NMR spectra of DERAm and Y259F mutant (Figure S9). This observation indicates that S257 and S258
might be the key phosphate interacting residues on the C-terminal
tail and demonstrates that the perturbation of the phosphate affinity
of the auxiliary phosphate-binding residues has a direct effect on
the affinity of the main phosphate-binding residues.

Discussion
In this report, we show that mutation of the C-terminal Y259 into
a phenylalanine leads to a drastic drop in the catalytic activity
of the monomer variant of ecDERA (i.e., DERAm) (Table 1), similar to the
effect observed in wild-type ecDERA.33 Such an observation indicates that the ηOH group of Y259 plays a crucial role in the function of ecDERA. Despite the presence of significant structural and
biochemical work on ecDERA,29,30,32,33,35,36 precise structural
information on how its intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail facilitates
the catalytic process has been largely unaddressed. Using NMR chemical
shift perturbations, we provide the first evidence demonstrating that
the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail samples conformations
which allow Y259 to enter the active site (i.e., closed state), in
the absence of the substrate (Figure 2). Such presampling of functionally relevant conformations
in the absence of substrates has been observed for several enzymes,
highlighting the importance of conformational flexibility for the
catalytic process. For example, loops within the structural core of
enzymes such as cyclophilin A,6 adenylate
kinase,18,83 and RNase A16 have the ability to sample catalytically relevant “closed”
state conformations in the absence of a substrate, and the frequency
of the sampling of such conformations correlates with the catalytic
turnover rates. We also attempted to quantify the exchange rate between
the open and closed states of the DERAm C-terminal tail. However,
even at 5 °C, the exchange process was too fast to obtain reliable
quantitative data from NMR CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments
(i.e., kex > 10000 s–1). Since DERAm-catalyzed dR5P breakdown proceeds with a kcat value of 19 s–1, fast sampling of
the open and closed states, in the substrate-free form, is unlikely
to be the rate-limiting step of DERAm catalysis. Experiments to probe
the effect of the natural substrate (dR5P) on the C-terminal tail
conformational sampling were hampered by the instability of the system.
Upon addition of dR5P, chemical shift as well as line width changes
in a series of 2D [1H–15N] HSQC spectra
were observed over time (Figure S10). These
time-dependent changes could be caused by acetaldehyde molecules,
formed during the reversible aldol reaction, which can react in a
sequential manner to form side products32 which may covalently attach to the enzyme.

Despite the conformational
plasticity of the C-terminal tail, the
population of the closed state was sufficiently large to give rise
to NOEs between the C-terminal tail and DERAm active site as well
as helix 10 (Figure 4B–D). Using the unambiguous NOE distance restraints, we were
able to derive a structural ensemble of the catalytically relevant
closed state. The NMR ensemble concurs with a closed state ensemble
generated through the MD simulations. Medium- to weak-intensity NOEs
were observed between residues showing hydrophobic interactions in
the MD simulations: i.e., Y259–L20, A256–A242, A246–L241,
and others (Table S2). From a structural
point of view, it appears that the closed state is not ideal for the
substrate entry and/or product exit, as Y259 blocks the entrance to
the active site pocket (Figure S11). Therefore,
a transition between open and closed states may be necessary for substrate
and product diffusion, as observed for rabbit muscle FBPA.37,84 Additionally, deletion of the C-terminal tail (D252stop mutant)
leads to a significant decrease in DERAm activity in comparison to
full-length DERAm. Interestingly, the activity of D252stop mutant
(kcat = 0.48 s–1 and KM = 0.12 mM) was moderately higher (2.4-fold
increase in kcat) than that of the Y259F
mutant. This increase could be attributed to efficient substrate entry
and/or product release in the absence of the C-terminal tail (i.e.,
the open conformation) and indicates that Y259 could be the only C-terminal
tail residue participating in the catalytic process.

In spite
of the abundance of biochemical data stressing the importance
of Y259 in DERA catalysis, the role of this crucial residue remained
inconclusive. Studies with Salmonella
typhimurium DERA, which is 96.5% sequence identical
with ecDERA, have shown that Y259 does not play a
role in facilitating active site Schiff base formation.34 In FBPA, the C-terminal tyrosine residue is
proposed to be a general base in the reaction with DHAP, enabling
the transformation of the imine to enamine intermediate.37,85 However, Heine et al.33 used a combination
of X-ray crystallography and 1D 1H NMR to rule out the
role of Y259 as a general base in the catalytic mechanism of ecDERA. Instead, it was proposed that a structurally conserved
water molecule participates in a proton relay, together with D102
and K201, responsible for the C2 proton abstraction from the substrate.

Our study shows that the C2 proton of propanal is abstracted by
DERAm and the Y259F mutant, similarly to the observations by Heine
et al.33 However, analysis of the real-time
propanal H/D exchange performed herein, using a 14-fold lower concentration
of the enzyme (relative to Heine et al.), reveals an ∼190-fold
increase in the time constant for the Y259F mutant catalyzed C2 proton
abstraction (Figure 5), making it the rate-limiting step for this mutant. A similar effect
was observed for FBPA after hydrolysis of the carboxy–terminal
peptide bond through carboxypeptidase treatment.85 Therefore, participation of Y259 in the ecDERA catalytic mechanism, together with residues D102 and K201, cannot
be ruled out. Two putative mechanisms could explain the role that
the Y259 ηOH group plays in lowering the activation
energy (ΔΔG⧧Y259F-DERAm value of ∼3 kcal mol–1, obtained from kcat in Table 1 using the Eyring equation) for the proton-abstraction
step. (1) Y259 ηOH acts as a general base to directly
abstract the C2 proton, as suggested previously for other class I
aldolases.37,86 In its absence, an alternative
mechanism such as the participation of a conserved water molecule
could drive the substrate proton abstraction, albeit inefficiently.
(2) Y259 ηOH participates in the proton-relay system,
originally proposed for ecDERA,33 by maintaining a desirable electrostatic environment for
fast proton abstraction. The absence of the Y259 ηOH group (e.g., in the Y259F and D252stop mutants) perturbs this
conducive environment, leading to a much slower proton abstraction.

Overlay of the NMR structure of the DERAm closed state with the
crystal structure of ecDERA bound to the carbinolamine
intermediate (PDB: 1JCL) reveals the presence of a steric clash between Y259 and the substrate
(Figure 7). Therefore,
after the substrate enters the active site, a reorientation of the
side chains of Y259 and other active site residues might be necessary.

Figure 7 Y259 side
chain clashed with the carbinolamine intermediate. An
overlay of the NMR DERAm closed state structure (yellow) with the
crystal structure of ecDERA in complex with the carbinolamine
reaction intermediate (PDB: 1JCL) reveals the presence of a steric clash between Y259
and the carbinolamine intermediate.

Using a combination of chemical shift perturbation analysis
and 31P NMR with different DERAm mutants, we have revealed
that
the C-terminal tail coordinates the active site phosphate moiety through
previously unknown auxiliary phosphate-binding residues (Figure 6 and Figure S9) involving amino acids 256–259.
For FBPA, a water-mediated coordination of the C-terminal Y363 with
inorganic phosphate and DHAP phosphate was proposed to generate a
reactive phenolate ion which carries out stereospecific proton abstraction
to generate the enamine intermediate.37 However, for DERAm we observed identical phosphate-binding affinities
regardless of the C-terminal residue: i.e., Y259 or F259. Furthermore,
the deprotonation of Y259 through a phosphate coordinating water molecule,
to generate a phenolate ion, can also be ruled out for DERAm due to
the near-identical chemical shifts of the Y259 epsilon carbon (Cε) in 50 mM HEPES and 50 mM KPi buffers (Y259 εC, 118.00 ppm in HEPES buffer;38 and Y259 εC, 118.04 ppm in KPi buffer).
Therefore, the auxiliary phosphate-binding residues might have an
alternative function.

The phosphate-binding region of ecDERA active
site shows the presence of A237, S238, and S239, forming a noncanonical
phosphate-binding site.30 Interestingly,
the auxiliary phosphate-binding residues form a noncanonical motif
(residues A256, S257, and S258) as well. Mutation of S257 and S258
into aspartic acids decreased Pi affinity not only at the
C-terminal tail but also in the active site. This demonstrates that
the residues in the two noncanonical phosphate-binding regions coordinate
the same phosphate molecule located at the active site. Since deletion
of the C-terminal tail results in a slight increase (1.9-fold, Table S3) in phosphate affinity in the vicinity
of the active site, the auxiliary phosphate-binding residues are not
required for the phosphate interaction of the main phosphate-binding
residues. Therefore, we hypothesize that these auxiliary residues
allow the C-terminal tail to dock onto the phosphate group of the
substrate, thereby stabilizing the closed state conformation. Such
docking may allow reorientation Y259 in an optimal position, avoiding
a steric clash with the substrate and enabling participation in the
C2 proton exchange step of the DERA catalytic reaction.

Conclusions
We have uncovered novel insights into the role of the rarely studied
intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail on a structural level and
provided a more detailed picture of the ecDERA catalytic
reaction mechanism. Although a comparison between the static crystal
structures of ecDERA in the apo- and substrate-bound
states has provided insights into understanding the DERA–substrate
interactions,32,33,35 our data demonstrate that conformational sampling of the C-terminal
tail is a key feature for efficient catalysis. The dynamic aspects
related to enzyme catalysis are becoming more evident with the development
of both experimental (e.g., NMR87 and multitemperature
and X-ray-free electron laser crystallography14) and computational (e.g., MD88 and Monte
Carlo simulations89) methods. The TIM-barrel
fold is one of the most common among enzymes, and many recent attempts
to design de novo enzymes showed an incredible evolvability of the
TIM-barrel scaffolds.90−92 The importance of loop dynamics within the TIM-barrel
fold family of enzymes, for the catalytic activity, has been highlighted
previously.93−97 However, to our knowledge, the results provided herein represent
the first structural evidence in the TIM-barrel fold family where
an intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail, located outside the fold,
not only samples catalytically relevant conformations in the absence
of a substrate but also participates in the catalytic reaction. Therefore,
our current contribution not only provides significant insights related
to DERAs specifically but also deepens the understanding of the involvement
of the intrinsic motions in catalysis of the TIM-barrel fold enzymes.

Furthermore, DERAs found in several human pathogens, e.g. Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Vibrio cholerae, and others (Figure S12), show a high
sequence identity (81% for V. cholerae and >94% identity for the others presented) with ecDERA, unlike human DERA with only 38% identity.98 All of these pathogens (except V. cholerae) have an identical C-terminal tail sequence. Since DERA plays a
crucial role in microbial survival by participating in nucleotide
catabolism and providing key metabolic intermediates such as acetaldehyde
and G3P, it is considered to be a promising drug target against human
pathogens.24,25 Considering the high sequence
identity between the aforementioned bacterial DERAs, their structural
and dynamic properties should be identical with those of ecDERA. The insights uncovered herein, together with the closed state
structure, should therefore aid in not only the development of better
DERA variants for efficient biocatalysis but also small-molecule inhibitors
targeting DERAs from human bacterial pathogens.
