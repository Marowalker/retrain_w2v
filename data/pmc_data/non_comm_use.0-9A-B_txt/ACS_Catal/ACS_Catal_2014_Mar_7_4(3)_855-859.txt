The
combination of the N-based pincer ligand PyBOX with Pt2+ leads to new catalysts for the enantioselective cycloisomerization
of dienyl- and trienyl-ols. The mechanistic combination of electrophilic
cyclization followed by rapid protodemetalation is surprising and
leads to a powerful construct for developing new reactions.

The steroid
skeleton is biosynthesized
by a fascinating cationic cascade cyclization of polyenes like squalene
or squalene oxide. The commercial import of bioactive steroids is,
however, not matched by synthetic methods for their de novo synthesis.
In fact, nearly all steroidal active ingredients are accessed through
semisynthetic means (i.e., derived from the natural pool). It is,
therefore, not surprising that biomimicking stereoselective cascade
syntheses of steroid-like compounds is of significant interest.1 The available methods include nonmetal electrophiles
such as Brønsted–Lewis acids,2 haloniums,3 organocatalysts,4 and metal electrophiles such as Hg(II),5 Pd(II),6 Pt(II),6c,7 Ir(I),8 and Au(I).9 Our group has focused on Pt(II)-based catalysts and previously
reported that the powerful electrophile [(triphos)Pt][BF4]2 can stoichiometrically convert various polyenes to
form polycyclic Pt-alkyl+ structures with high diastereoselectivity.6l,o,p

Despite the successful
development of catalytic tandem cyclization/β-H
elimination,7a,7b,7h cyclization/fluorination,7f and cyclization/oxygenation7g reactions, the parent cyclization/protonation
reaction (a catalytic cycloisomerization) putatively obtained via
protodemetalation of a cyclization-derived Pt-alkyl has not been achieved,
because protonolysis of the resulting bulky (triphos)Pt-alkyl+ complexes requires strong acids like TfOH, which are not
compatible with polyene substrates.10 This
reactivity exemplifies the underlying problem that the properties
of electrophilic alkene activation and protodemetalation have opposite
ligand preferences, the former favoring electron-deficient ligands
and the latter electron-rich ligands.11,12 Our own investigations
on the (triphos)Pt-R+ system have shown that protodemetalation
of Pt–C bonds with acids milder than HOTf is feasible when
more electron-rich tridentate phosphine ligands are employed; however,
electron-rich ligands also decrease the electrophilicity of Pt(II)
catalysts and hinder the cascade cyclization portion of the tandem
process.7c Herein, we report the development
of a new generation of chiral platinum catalysts that carry out the
cyclization/protodemetalation of polyenes under exceedingly mild conditions.

The PyBOX (pyridine-2,6-bisoxazolines) ligands form pincer complexes
with a variety of metals, and they have proven to be highly effective
in asymmetric catalysis.13 However, to
the best of our knowledge, there are no reported uses of platinum(II)–PyBOX
complexes in catalysis.14 This rarity could
be due to the difficulties in synthesizing such complexes, because
“hard” nitrogen ligands tend to be poor ligands for
“soft” complexes of Pt(II).15 We report herein that this mismatch has significant catalytic advantages.
Consistent with its poor ligand quality, an especially labile Pt source,
Pt(DMSO)2I2, was required to successfully obtain
the cationic (PyBOX)Pt–I+ catalyst precursor; the
NNN ligand does not displace the typical alkene-based precursor.

Our studies began with an attempt to synthesize an (NNN)Pt variant
of the readily isolable (PPP)Pt–alkyl+ complexes,6c,7d,7e with initial experiments employing
the commercially available isopropyl PyBOX ligand 1a (see
Chart 1). (R)-1a was preactivated by AgBF4 to generate the dication and
then reacted with 2a along with a stoichiometric quantity
of Ph2NH. As shown in eq 1, 1H NMR spectroscopy revealed that after 1 h, 2a was completely consumed, but the (NNN)Pt-alkyl+ complex
was not observed; the only observable organic product was 3a. We presumed that 3a was formed by the rapid protodemetalation
of an unobserved (NNN)Pt-R+ complex with Ph2NH2+. The lack of 4, a reporter
for the build-up of even trace Brønsted acid,16 indicated that protodemetalation was much more rapid than
for (PPP)Pt-R+ analogues and thus suggested the feasibility
of a general catalytic cyclization/protonation pathway. 1  

When this reaction was repeated with 10 mol % (PyBOX)Pt2+, no desired product was formed after even a prolonged period
of
time. In fact, the only organic product observed in GC was the β-hydride
elimination product 5, which was not even observed under
stoichiometric conditions. Intrigued by this observation, we began
a study to test the effect of additives on the outcome of the reaction,
surmising that the principal difference between stoichiometric and
catalytic conditions was the presence of excess substrate. 2  

In this set of experiments, 1 equiv of 2a was
combined
with 1 equiv of the activated catalyst and 1 equiv of a terminal alkene;
the distribution of products was monitored by GC-MS. When 1 additional
equiv of 2a was added to the mixture, the yield of 3a was drastically reduced, and the major product was 5 (entry 1, Table 1). A significant
drop in reaction rate was also noted (12 h for 2 equiv of 2a vs 1 h for 1 equiv). Styrene was particularly adept at shifting
the product distribution to 5, though electron-withdrawing
groups partially reversed this trend. Notably, in all of these cases,
the enantioselectiviy of 3a and 5 were similar,
suggesting that both products likely formed from the same intermediate
(the alkyl).

The mechanistic source for this additive effect remains unclear,
but this issue can awkwardly be circumvented by the sequential addition
of 1 equiv of 2a after the previous equivalent was fully
consumed. Better yet is the slow addition of 2a to the
catalyst by syringe pump, which enables the substrate concentration
to be kept suitably low that rapid consumption occurs and protodemetalation
dominates. Thus, adding 10 equiv of 2a over 12 h via
syringe pump to the activated catalyst with 1 equiv of Ph2NH at room temperature resulted in an excellent isolated yield of 3a, with an enantioselectivity that is only slightly reduced
from stoichiometric conditions (eq 2).

Because stoichiometric mixtures of catalyst and 2a effectively
mimicked the efficiency and enantioselectivity of the
syringe pump addition method, the reaction conditions were conveniently
optimized in this fashion. Controls supported the viability of this
approach and confirmed that no cyclization/protodemetalation occurred
without the platinum complex (entry 2, Table 2).

In a previous computational study, bases that hydrogen bond to
the protic terminus were found to greatly facilitate the cyclization,17 hence its inclusion (Ph2NH) in the
originally tested condition (entry 1, Table 2, 24% ee). Weaker (Ph3N) and stronger (Ph2NMe
and PhNH2) bases were also explored,18 but the highest enantioselectivity was achieved when no
base was employed while still maintaining high conversion to 2a (entry 3). Again, the lack of 4 indicates
that alkyl protonolysis is considerably faster than Brønsted
cyclization of 2a.

The reaction outcome depends
strongly on the choice of solvent,
with nonpolar solvents being hampered by poor catalyst solubility.18 Polar, noncoordinating solvents like nitromethane
and nitroethane provided the highest conversion to 3a (entries 3 and 4, Table 2), whereas CH2Cl2 provided only traces of 3a (entry
5) due to the formation of inactive (PyBOX)Pt–Cl+ by chloride abstraction from the solvent. A polar, coordinating
solvent such as acetonitrile (entry 6) competitively coordinates to
the dicationic platinum catalyst and hinders access to the free coordination
site on platinum. The identity of the counterion in the silver salt
was unimportant, and lower temperatures did not improve the ee (0
°C, 40% ee).

Chart 1 Pre-Catalysts Employed in This Study
Using the optimum conditions, a series of PyBOX
ligand variants
were examined (Chart 1). Across the series
steric effects were found to principally impact catalyst reactivity.
Illustrative was 1a and 1f with oxazoline iso-Pr and tert-Bu groups at C2. The former
gave high conversion, although the latter was unreactive even at elevated
temperature (entries 3 and 8, Table 2). Some
sensitivity to the C3-geminal alkyl group was also noted for 1a, 1h (R = Me, entry 9), 1i (R
= Et, entry 10), and 1k (R = Ph, entry 11). As the bulkiness
of the C3 substituents increased, sharp drops in reactivity were noted,
with side products (e.g., 4) forming for the slower reactions.
Consistent with unpublished studies showing the necessity of a dicationic
platinum cyclization initiator, the anionic ligand 1n did not consume substrate (entry 12). Among all screened ligands,
only 1h was comparable to 1a, but the latter’s
commercial availability made it the preferred choice.

The optimized
condition was subsequently applied to a variety of
dienyl and trienyl phenols and alcohols using the syringe pump method
(Table 3). In all cases, the reaction went
to completion with 10 mol % (R)-1a,
and the products were obtained in a highly diastereoselective manner.
Electron-withdrawing groups or electron-donating groups on the aryl
gave products in good yield but lower enantioselectivity than 2a. Both 3d and 3e were isolated
in low yield due to their high volatility (entries 4 and 5, 86% and
83% GC yield, respectively). Triene alcohol and triene phenol substrates
gave lower isolated yields than did 3a.

A proposed catalytic cycle is shown
in Scheme 1. It includes the coordination of
the (PyBOX)Pt2+ catalyst to the least-substituted C=C
bond in the substrate,
initiation of the cascade to release a proton which rapidly protodemetalates
the putative N3Pt-alkyl+ complex A, to generate the polycyclic product and turn over the catalytic cycle.
Consistent with this scenario was the cyclization of 2a-d, which generates 3a-d as a single diastereomer with deuterium
residing at the C3 position of the A ring (sterol numbering)
(eq 3). Attempts to isolate the cationic complex A by quenching the reaction with a strong base such as styrene-bound
piperidine, 2,4,6-tert-butylpyridine or proton sponge
were not successful. 3  

Scheme 1 Proposed Catalytic Cycle
In summary, we have developed a new chiral platinum–PyBOX
complex that is capable of the cyclization/protonation of polyenes
to polycyclic structures with good yield, high diastereo-selectivity,
and moderate enantioselectivity. These studies also demonstrate that
changes in the hard/soft character of the ligands can significantly
increase the tendency for (oxidatively-induced) protodemetalative
reactions at a cationic Pt(II) center.19 Studies to further understand this observation and to apply this
finding to explore other turnover pathways are underway.

General Procedure
for Pt(II)-Catalyzed Cycloisomerization of
Polyenes
To a 3.5 mL vial with a septum cap was added (R)-[(i-Pr-PyBOX)PtI][BF4] (71.0
mg, 0.1
mmol, 0.1 equiv) and AgBF4 (29.2 mg, 0.15 mmol, 0.15 equiv)
in CD3NO2 (0.5 mL). The resulting mixture was
stirred
in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. Substrate (1.0 mmol, 1.0
equiv) in CD3NO2 (1.0 mL) was loaded into a
1.0 mL Norm-Ject Plastic syringe. The syringe was then mounted to
a Fisher Scientific Single Syringe Pump (model no. 14-831-200). The
parameters of the syringe pump were set as the following: rate of
0.05 mL/h, volume of 1.0 mL, and diameter of 5.0 mm. The needle of
the syringe was pierced through the septum cap of the vial containing
the reaction mixture. The syringe pump was started with the above
parameters. After the reaction was complete, the product was isolated
from the reaction mixture by preparative thin-layer chromatography.
