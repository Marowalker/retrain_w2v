The
gas composition surrounding a catalytic sample has direct impact
on its surface structure, which is essential when in situ investigations
of model catalysts are performed. Herein a study of the gas phase
close to a Pd(110) surface during CO oxidation under semirealistic
conditions is presented. Images of the gas phase, provided by planar
laser-induced fluorescence, clearly visualize the formation of a boundary
layer with a significantly lower CO partial pressure close to the
catalytically active surface, in comparison to the overall concentration
as detected by mass spectrometry. The CO partial pressure variation
within the boundary layer will have a profound effect on the catalysts’
surface structure and function and needs to be taken into consideration
for in situ model catalysis studies.

Introduction
Catalytic properties of the transition
metals have been studied
intensely for decades and are of great importance in order to develop
existing catalysts as well as to achieve a fundamental understanding
of the chemical processes.1,2 A significant effort
has been directed toward understanding the active phase of the surface
by studying gas–surface interactions on model catalysts. These
studies have mainly been carried out in controlled environments, signified
by low temperatures and ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), in which the number
of molecules interacting with the surface is low. However, real catalysts
are usually operating at higher pressures, where the interaction between
gas molecules and the surface is more prominent. The gas molecules
close to the surface have been shown to affect the surface structure
and thereby play a crucial role for the catalytic function.3,4 For this reason, the surface science community has developed traditional
surface-sensitive techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy
(STM),5 surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD),6 and high-pressure X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
(HPXPS)7 to operate at higher pressure,
in situ.8−10 What is often overseen is that at higher pressure
the flow of gases through the catalysis reactor will have a substantial
impact on the interaction between the catalyst surface and gas molecules;11,12 nevertheless, studies of the gas composition adjacent to the catalyst
surface is to a large extent lacking, which emphasizes the importance
of studying the gas phase when aiming for characterization of catalysts
under realistic conditions. CO oxidation is one of the most investigated
reactions in heterogeneous catalysis and has been studied in great
detail.13,14 The relatively simple reaction pathway,
which only involves diatomic reactants (CO and O2) and
a triatomic product (CO2), makes it ideal for fundamental
studies of the catalytic reaction mechanism. Studies of CO oxidation
at elevated pressures (1 mbar to 300 mbar) using palladium as a catalyst
show that in a highly active regime, the CO2 production
reaches a steady-state level that does not increase with temperature.6,15 This is called the mass transfer limited (MTL) regime and appears
due to depletion of one of the reactants close to the catalyst surface.16 In this regime, the reaction is not temperature
dependent but is limited by gas diffusion. Previous studies of CO
oxidation over Pd single-crystal samples show that the surface structure
changes as the highly active regime is reached,17 which is strongly dependent on the total pressure and temperature.
Even though the catalyst is highly active, neither adsorbed CO nor
CO in the gas phase close to the surface could be detected in any
of these studies.7,18 To accomplish a complete picture
of the mechanism behind CO oxidation at elevated pressures, knowledge
of partial pressures and the flow of the reactant gas molecules above
the catalyst surface is highly relevant.

Mass spectrometry (MS)
allows for simultaneous monitoring of multiple
gaseous species in a reactor. However, when the MS probe is located
at the reactor outlet, it measures an average over the entire chamber
volume. Yet, when the surface structure of a catalyst is studied,
knowledge of the gas-phase composition just above the sample surface
is necessary. To achieve this, the MS probe, usually a thin quartz
orifice, can be positioned close to the surface and probe the gas
at that point.19,20 This method has been refined
by Roos et al., and a lateral resolution of about 100 μm has
been achieved.21 The limitation of this
approach is that only one single point at a time can be investigated,
making 2D mapping under nonstationary conditions infeasible. Other
drawbacks, often encountered when using probe techniques, are the
uncertainties introduced due to the probe affecting the gas flow and
temperature in the reactor. A strong nonintrusive alternative to MS,
often used in studies of catalysis, is Fourier transform infrared
spectrometry (FTIR), where continuous infrared light is guided through
the sample gas, allowing for multispecies detection by absorption.
Snively et al. refined the FTIR technique for spatially resolved measurements
in 2D by using a focal plane array22 and
have also worked toward combinatorial screening with FTIR,23 reporting a temporal resolution of 2 s with
sufficient spectral resolution. However, the inherent problem of FTIR
is that, even though 2D measurements can be achieved, the signal will
be a measure of the integrated absorption over the entire path through
the reaction chamber where information on inhomogeneous temperature
and species concentrations is lost: i.e., it is a line-of-sight measurement
technique lacking information in this direction. Thus, a nonintrusive
method enabling chemically specific detection as well as high spatial
resolution along all three spatial dimensions would clearly be advantageous.

Laser-based techniques for gas-phase diagnostics have since long
been developed and applied, for example, in atmospheric chemistry
and combustion research.24 Probing with
laser beams allows for nonintrusive access to the measurement region
for in situ detection, of high importance for reactive flows. Moreover,
high spatial resolution down to ∼100 μm and high temporal
resolution can be obtained using focused laser beams and pulsed lasers,
respectively. Among these methods laser-induced fluorescence (LIF),
based on the resonant absorption of laser photons and the detection
of spontaneously emitted fluorescence, provides chemical species specific
detection with high sensitivity. Moreover, planar laser-induced fluorescence
(PLIF), where the beam is shaped into a thin laser sheet, allows for
imaging measurements where the thickness of the focused laser sheet
determines the depth resolution.

In this study, PLIF has been
used to study the gas phase in situ
close to the surface during CO oxidation above a Pd(110) single crystal
at semirealistic CO and O2 partial pressures. To obtain
a more comprehensive picture of the process, both CO and CO2 were probed by PLIF to obtain images of the distributions, visualizing
the reaction in an intelligible way. The results show that the gas
composition near the active sample is completely different, in comparison
with the rest of the volume in the reactor, and that changes in gas
composition close to the sample occur on a subsecond time scale.

Methods
Samples
and Catalysis Reactor with Mass Spectrometer
The sample investigated
is a Pd single crystal of dimension 4 ×
4 mm2 and with a (110) surface orientation. Initially the
crystal was cleaned by sputtering and heating cycles in a separate
chamber but was exposed to air prior to insertion into the reactor
for optical diagnostics. To reduce sample contamination, the sample
temperature was ramped up and down in a CO, O2, and Ar
atmosphere before the measurements. The reactor is made of stainless
steel, has a cubical shape, and is described in more detail in ref (25). Gases were supplied to
the reactor by individual mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst EL-FLOW,
50 mLn/min) via a 2 m long (d = 1/8 in.)
gas tube, and the gas composition in the reactor was measured with
a quadruple mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer PrismaPlus QMG220, lowest
partial pressure 4 × 10–12 mbar). The MS was
connected to the outlet of the reactor via a 20 cm (d = 1/16 in.) gas tube together with a pressure controller. The temporal
resolution of the mass spectrometer is approximately 0.4 s for the
individual gases. The reactor arrangement is a well-controlled system
that allows experiments to be carried out with a high degree of reproducibility.

Laser-Induced Fluorescence
Laser-induced fluorescence
measurements were carried out on two separate occasions using two
different laser setups to study CO and CO2, respectively,
but the catalysis reactor, MS setup, crystal sample, and associated
experimental conditions were the same in both cases (see Figure 1). The temperature and MS plots shown in Figure 2 were obtained simultaneously with the CO PLIF measurements.

Figure 1 Schematic

laser units, sheet-forming optics (L1/3 and L2/4), and detector (FPA/ICCD)
together with the arrangement of the catalysis reactor, mass-flow
controllers (MFC), vacuum pump, and mass spectrometer (MS).

Electronic CO resonances are located
in the vacuum ultraviolet
regime, and LIF was obtained via two-photon excitation in the B1Σ+ ← X1Σ+(0,0) Hopfield–Birge band using 230 nm,26 followed by population of the A state via collisions or
radiative transitions with fluorescence emission bands in the wavelength
range 450–660 nm. Excitation was carried out using a picosecond
laser system consisting of a mode-locked Nd:YAG laser (PL2143C, Ekspla)
with external amplifier (APL70-1100, Ekspla). The Nd:YAG third harmonic
at 355 nm pumps an Optical Parametric Generator (PG 401-P80-SH, Ekspla),
tuned to 230 nm. The laser pulse repetition rate was 10 Hz, the pulse
duration was 80 ps, and the line width at 230 nm was specified to
be 5 cm–1. The pulse energy at 230 nm was typically
0.4 mJ, which combined with the 80 ps pulse duration provides high
peak power, highly beneficial for the two-photon excitation process.
For CO PLIF imaging the 230 nm laser beam was directed into the reactor
and shaped into a ∼5 mm high vertical sheet using two cylindrical
lenses of focal lengths f = +500 mm and f = +300 mm. The sheet thickness was estimated to be 300 μm.
For picosecond excitation with this beam focusing arrangement and
at the low CO partial pressures in the chamber effects of interfering
stimulated emission can be considered negligible.27 Images were acquired using an f = 50 mm
objective (Nikkor f/1.2) and a 36 mm extension tube mounted on an
ICCD camera (PI-MAX3, Princeton Instruments). Images were acquired
at a 10 Hz repetition rate with the intensifier gate set to 30 ns.
A long-pass filter (GG395, Schott) was used to suppress scattering
and fluorescence from surfaces in the reactor.

While CO2 lacks accessible transitions in the ultraviolet/visible
spectral regime, it is, however, active in the mid-infrared, where
several transitions can be probed. In this work CO2 is
excited via the P12 line of the (00°0) → (10°01)
combination band at 2.7 μm, generated by difference-frequency
mixing the output from a dye laser (PRSC-D-18, Sirah) at 763 nm with
the fundamental frequency from a Nd:YAG laser (PRO 290-10, Spectra
Physics) at 1064 nm in a LiNbO3 crystal. The laser operated
at a 10 Hz repetition rate had a 5 ns pulse duration and an estimated
line width of 0.025 cm–1, and the pulse energy at
2.7 μm was 4 mJ. The CO2 fluorescence at 4.26 μm
was then imaged onto a 2D focal plane array detector (FPA) (SBF LP134,
Santa Barbara Focal Plane) through an interference filter centered
around 4.26 μm to discriminate background. To further discriminate
thermal background, an inherent difficulty when working in the mid-infrared
regime, the FPA was triggered at 20 Hz, thus taking an extra image
between every laser shot, making subtraction of the thermal background
possible. The integration for each frame was 15 μs and was chosen
for efficient collection of the CO2 fluorescence signal,
which is more than 100 μs long at these pressures, while avoiding
detector saturation by the thermal background. The CO2 fluorescence
images, with a spatial resolution of 400 μm in all three dimensions
(limited by the thickness of the laser sheet), visualized the distribution
of CO2 in the reaction chamber. A more detailed account
of the experimental setup can be found in ref (25).

Data Analysis
Conversion of CO PLIF signals into quantitative
concentrations was carried out using calibration data acquired in
the catalysis reactor at 150 °C on mixtures with specified CO
concentrations. The PLIF images acquired under such stationary conditions
showed a homogeneous CO distribution over the field of view and no
effects of laser beam focusing. The average CO LIF signal in the laser
sheet region showed a linear dependence on CO concentration, and a
straight line was fitted for each image pixel. The fitted line was
used together with data on the reactor temperature and laser pulse
energy, for concentration evaluation of CO images acquired during
the reaction (see the Supporting Information). The laser overlaps with multiple rotational lines in the CO Q-branch,
and simulations using the PGOPHER software28 gave an average rotational population change of 11% for the levels
involved in the strongest Q-branch transitions over the investigated
temperature interval. Thus, the influence of population redistribution
was considered to be limited and reactor temperatures were only used
to compensate for gas density changes in the evaluation.

The
CO2 PLIF signals were calibrated to semiquantitative number
densities by using a calibration measurement set at various known
CO2 concentrations, at known temperatures. The temperature
for the gas close to the sample was approximated by the measured temperature
of the sample holder. Due to radiation trapping or self-absorption,
mole fractions higher than 2% of CO2 cannot be reliably
calibrated in the present experiments (indicated by a dashed line
in Figure 2), but up to about 2% the signal
shows a linear dependence. The calibration was made pixel by pixel,
but due to the limitations described above, the 2D images show no
quantitative results.

The mass spectrometry data for CO and
O2 were calibrated
with the same data set as for the CO PLIF data (discussed above).
A linear dependence was found between the CO and O2 partial
pressures and the ion current measured for m/z 28 and 32, respectively. This correlation together with
the cracking pattern was used to analyze the MS signal. The CO2 signal was not calibrated but scaled with the assumption
that the consumed CO was converted into CO2 (see the Supporting Information).

The temperature
was measured with a type C thermocouple attached
to the sample holder, and in addition, an IR camera (FLIRP620) was
monitoring the temperature of the Pd(110) surface during the CO experiments.
The camera was calibrated versus the thermocouple temperature reading
when the sample was inactive. The emissivity changes with temperature,
however, which introduces errors in the measured temperature of the
active Pd(110) surface. Nevertheless, the data provide a clear verification
of when the Pd(110) sample becomes active.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 summarizes
the results of a CO oxidation experiment where the Pd(110) sample
temperature was ramped up from 250 to 380 °C and back again in
a 18 mLn/min CO and O2 and 36 mLn/min Ar flow at 106 mbar total pressure (resulting in an initial
partial pressure of 26.5 mbar of CO, 26.5 mbar of O2, and
53 mbar of Ar). The incident laser sheet is oriented perpendicular
to the surface, centered over the sample, and gives rise to a fluorescence
signal that is imaged in panels A and B for CO and CO2,
respectively. In the middle panel, subfigure a shows temperature profiles
measured by the thermocouple on the sample holder (green) and by an
IR camera on the sample (purple). Subfigure b shows the average gas
composition in the reactor as analyzed by the MS. In the side panels,
subfigures AI–AIII and BI–BIII show the PLIF images
of the CO and CO2 distribution, respectively, at the acquisition
times indicated by the dashed lines in the middle panel. The average
LIF signals extracted from the dashed boxes (0.5 mm above the sample)
are shown in subfigures c and d of the middle panel.

CO2 PLIF images (10 lasershot averages). Image acquisition
time 1 s. The regions from which the CO and CO2 signals
have been evaluated are indicated by dashed rectangles above the sample.
The sample is in a highly active phase at temperatures above 365 °C
during the time interval 290–420 s, resulting in intense catalytic
CO oxidation.

The IR camera temperature
profile shows a sudden increase at around
295 s when the sample reaches a temperature of 365 °C, which
coincides with a significant change of the gas composition in the
chamber. Within only a few seconds, the temperature of the sample
and the CO2 concentration in the chamber increase substantially,
whereas CO and O2 levels decrease, which together is interpreted
as the catalytic ignition of the sample. The ignition temperature
is higher than that observed in previous studies of Pd(110),18,29,30 which could be explained by a
lower O2:CO partial pressure ratio and the higher total
pressure employed by this study. Accordingly, a higher ignition temperature
with increasing total as well as oxygen partial pressure has previously
been reported for Pd(100).7 As the sample
enters the highly active regime at 365 °C, indicated by a sudden
decrease and increase of the CO and CO2 LIF signals, respectively,
a plateau in the CO2 signal is observed as a result of
a maximum level of CO conversion that is reached.

In addition
to monitoring the average temporal profile, PLIF data
provide local spatial information on the gas composition as shown
in the side panels in Figure 2. These images
are averages over 10 single-shot frames, representing a time interval
of 1 s.

Images AI and BI were acquired before the sample was
active, resulting
in a strong CO signal distributed homogeneously over the laser sheet,
whereas no CO2 signal is detected. The middle images, AII
and BII, show the gas distributions at the ignition of the sample:
i.e., the moment when the sample makes the transition to the highly
active regime. Already at this stage, a region of circular shape with
significant CO2 signal is observed around the sample, which
is extended when the temperature is increased further, as can be seen
in image BIII, acquired when the CO2 concentration in the
reactor has reached its plateau level. The opposite trend is observed
for CO (images AII and AIII), where ignition results in a rapid signal
decrease, corresponding to a decrease in partial pressure of 4 mbar/s,
resulting in a very weak signal, indicated by circular regions of
low partial pressure, over the active sample in images AII and AIII.
Overall, the images visualize the buildup of a boundary layer around
the crystal surface when the reaction goes from low activity to the
MTL regime.

The spatially resolved PLIF measurement makes it
possible to analyze
the CO concentration at different positions covered by the laser sheet
in the reactor, as shown in Figure 3a. The
laser sheet is approximately 5 mm in height, and together with the
camera field of view this results in a measurement area of approximately
16 × 5 mm2 in which the CO concentration can be obtained
in each image pixel, as shown in Figure 3b.
Figure 3c shows the MS CO profile together
with CO concentration profiles evaluated from the top left corner
of the measured region approximately 9 mm from the surface center
(light blue curve) and a region immediately above the catalyst surface
(pink curve). Quantitatively the CO profiles measured in the top left
corner by LIF and by MS agree within 2%, which confirms that the LIF
signal measured around 9 mm from the sample represents the overall
CO composition in the reactor. However, the LIF profile measured close
to the catalyst surface, the pink curve in Figure 3c, shows significantly lower CO concentration. At this position
the CO concentration decreases by approximately 80%, which can be
compared to a decrease of 20–30% observed for the CO LIF profile
in the corner and the MS data. Thus, the local composition above the
sample surface differs significantly from that averaged over the reactor
volume. Therefore, the MS signal detected at the reactor outlet does
not represent the partial pressure of CO close to the active surface
under these conditions. The low overall CO conversion of ∼25%
detected by MS is due to the rather large volume of the reactor (240
mL) and implies that most of the CO molecules pass the chamber without
interacting with the catalyst. This is a common issue for reactors
where experiments on single-crystal model catalysts are performed,10,18 in contrast to experiments carried out in flow-through reactors
where it is possible to observe a 100% conversion.31 In addition to the spatial information, the LIF data (pink
curve) gives instantaneous information on changes in the gas phase
over the sample, while the MS shows an averaged signal (black curve)
from the entire chamber, which is delayed by approximately 5 s in
comparison with the LIF signal. The drastic change in the CO partial
pressure, close to the surface, when the sample ignites is clearly
visualized as a sharp drop in the pink LIF signal shown in Figure 3c. The slope of the blue LIF signal as well as the
MS is not as steep over the ignition region, which can be explained
by the flow in the chamber.32 Due to the
cubical geometry of the reactor, the gas flow will not be homogeneous
through the chamber and the gas molecules may circulate in the chamber
before they reach the gas outlet. This mixing will contribute to smeared-out
concentration profiles in time, as monitored by MS and LIF measured
outside the boundary layer (blue curve).

of the reactor showing the location of the
laser sheet (blue curve) probing the gas molecules and (b) the camera
field of view resulting in fluorescence images. (c) MS CO signal (black
curve) plotted together with LIF CO data extracted from two regions
(blue and pink rectangle) shown in (b). The blue CO LIF data were
measured approximately 9 mm from the sample center, whereas those
for the pink curve were measured 0.5 mm above the surface center.

To achieve a better understanding
of the gas-phase CO distribution
surrounding the crystal, concentration profiles have been evaluated
along a vertical region above the sample center and along a horizontal
region above the sample surface. These regions with evaluated profiles
are displayed in Figure 4 and show the CO partial
pressure variation with the distance from the surface center.

Figure 4 CO partial
pressure profiles evaluated from image regions indicated
by boxes in (c). (a) Vertical profiles measured at pre- and postactivation
(purple and dark blue lines) show constant CO partial pressure, while
profiles measured at ignition (green line) and in the active phase
(blue and red lines) show a gradient of the CO partial pressure with
lowest pressure closest to the surface. (b) Horizontal profiles extracted
0.3 mm from the surface for the same activity stages as in (a). Profiles
measured pre- and postactivation (purple and dark blue lines) show
constant CO pressure, whereas profiles measured at ignition (green
line) and in the active phase (blue and red lines) are symmetric around
the sample center position (0 mm), where the CO pressure is lowest.
(c) PLIF image of CO distribution above the Pd(110) sample, where
the regions of interest for the profiles are shown. (d) Surface plot
showing how the CO pressure profile 0.3 mm above the sample evolves
with time during the 40 s when the sample goes from low activity to
the highly active regime (see the Supporting Information for a movie showing a rotation of Figure 4d).

Profiles retrieved from images acquired prior to sample activation,
at 40 s (dark blue), show a rather constant partial pressure around
27 mbar, corresponding to a homogeneous CO distribution also shown
in Figure 2, image AI. As mentioned above,
the sample ignition at around 295 s results in a rapid decrease in
the CO pressure, for which the global trend is observed by both LIF
and MS (cf. Figure 3c). However, the profiles
in Figure 4a,b representing the CO pressure
immediately above the sample reveal a more detailed picture of the
CO distribution at this time. The green profiles show a sudden local
decrease of the CO pressure down to ∼15 mbar above the surface
center with a gradually increasing pressure up to 20 mbar 5 mm above
the surface, as shown in Figure 4a. This is
an indication of the buildup of a boundary layer close to the surface.
In addition, when the sample has entered the highly active regime,
represented by profiles taken at 310 s (red color), the CO profiles
show a vertical gradient and the evaluated CO partial pressure is
only 5 mbar at a distance of ∼0.3 mm above the surface center.
Profiles measured at the end of the highly active regime at time 350
s, shown in light blue, are similar to those at 310 s (red color)
and the CO partial pressure distribution surrounding the sample remains
rather constant during the active regime, indicating that the MTL
is reached. When the temperature is decreased so that the MTL is removed,
represented by profiles measured after 500 s (purple), the CO concentration
approaches the initial value (cf. Figure 2d).

The horizontal profile acquired during the active phase at 350
s, displayed in Figure 4b, shows a CO partial
pressure going from 5 mbar in the center of the sample (at position
0 mm) to around 10 mbar at the sample edge at 2.5 mm from the surface
center. Thus, it is clear that the CO concentration in the depletion
region is not homogeneous over the sample surface but increases radially
from the center of the surface.

The information in Figure 4b can be followed
in more detail over time, and Figure 4d shows
how the CO pressure 0.3 mm above the surface evolves during ignition
(time 270–310 s). The ignition process is very fast, but the
LIF data acquisition rate of 10 Hz is sufficient to trace local CO
pressure changes when the sample goes from low to high activity. The
3D plot shows that the CO pressure already prior to ignition has a
slightly curved pressure profile over the surface (red part of Figure 4d at 270 s). However, after ignition (blue part
of Figure 4d) the curvature of the profile
is even more pronounced, which is also shown in the blue and red profiles
in Figure 4b. The symmetric shape of the boundary
layer detected around the sample center indicates that the activity
is symmetric across the surface of the sample. Altogether, these kinds
of spatially resolved data permit analysis of sample activity on a
local level, clearly valuable for studies of more complex systems
with heterogeneous samples.

In the literature, the buildup of
boundary layers around the sample
surface is pointed out to be the reason for the plateau that is reached
in the maximum CO2 production.16,30 Within the boundary layer, the conversion of reactants is faster
than the transport of products away from the volume close to the sample
and therefore inhibits the reactants to reach the surface. In this
phase the CO conversion is not temperature dependent and the maximum
CO2 production is limited by the supply from the gas phase
and not by the catalyst itself. We clearly observe a boundary layer
of CO2 close to the Pd(110) surface but can still detect
CO in the same area. The horizontal CO profiles (Figure 4b) show an almost even decrement of the CO concentration with
increasing temperature close to the surface prior ignition, but immediately
after ignition a bent CO profile is observed. Even though the temperature
is increased from 365 to 380 °C in the highly active MTL regime,
the CO concentration profiles do not change (cf. Figure 4a,b). This indicates a steady-state production of CO2, also observed globally with both MS and LIF, interpreted as the
reaction being mass transfer limited by CO. Surprisingly, CO is detected
0.3 mm from the surface, indicating that the depletion region of CO
is a few hundred microns or less above the surface when the reaction
is mass transfer limited. The significant drop in CO pressure close
to the surface is probably the reason gas-phase CO is not observed
in previous studies based on HPXPS and PM-IRAS.7,18 In
those cases the amount of CO is most probably below the detection
limit and therefore cannot be observed.

Matera et al. calculated
boundary layers for CO oxidation over
RuO2(110) in a stagnation flow reactor with oxygen as minority
reactant.11 While instead CO is the minority
reactant in our experiments, the obtained concentration profiles are
nevertheless in good agreement with the calculated oxygen pressure
profiles presented by Matera et al. They reported on different CO
pressures at the edges of the sample and predict a decrease of approximately
90% of the minority species close to the catalyst surface center.
Our results clearly visualize the inhomogeneous CO pressure over the
surface, and we can confirm experimentally a decrease of 80% of the
CO pressure at the surface center, while the decrease is less apparent
toward the sample edges: cf. Figure 4b.

Summary
We report instantaneous visualization of gas-phase CO and CO2 distributions during catalytic oxidation over a Pd(110) model
catalyst at elevated pressure. A 1:1 ratio of CO and O2 is used, for which an ignition temperature of 365 °C of the
sample is observed. High-resolution CO PLIF images indicate that only
a fraction of the gas molecules interact with the catalyst surface
and that the flow and geometry of the chamber are important parameters
to consider when catalysts are studied. Images show that a semicircular
depletion region of low CO partial pressure (boundary layer) is formed
above the surface when the sample is active. A gradient in CO partial
pressure is observed above the sample where the lowest CO partial
pressure detected is 5 ± 2 mbar, ∼0.3–1 mm above
the sample surface center. Both LIF and MS data indicate that the
catalytic reaction is mass transfer limited by CO and LIF detection
of 5 mbar of CO 0.3 mm above the sample, indicating that the CO depletion
region in the MTL regime is localized very close to the surface. Furthermore,
the CO partial pressure shows an inhomogeneous distribution along
the sample surface with 5 ± 2 mbar in the center and 10 ±
2 mbar at the edges. Generally, the distribution of CO molecules over
the surface will be dependent on the dimensions and symmetry of the
sample as well as the geometry of the chamber and thus the gas flow
over the catalyst surface. Our results show that the pressure measured
with MS does not represent the gas composition close to the sample
surface. The gas composition detected at the outlet with the MS is
smeared out and is not truly representative for the gas composition
close to the sample surface where LIF provides instantaneous detection
of local changes.

Techniques for surface structure determination
probe a relatively
small surface area at a time, ranging from a few micrometers to a
couple of millimeters. To achieve a representative picture of the
entire surface structure, the surface–gas interaction should
therefore be identical over the sample surface, which implies a homogeneous
gas composition over the catalyst; this is also most often assumed.
As shown in our results, this is not the case and the gas composition
can vary significantly over the sample surface. Nevertheless, average
structural information about the surface could in principle be obtained
by measurements at multiple sample positions. This would then instead
imply that the gas composition has to be stable over time, which is
rarely the case for catalysis studies. This demonstrates the importance
to obtain detailed information on the gas phase close to the catalyst
surface, which in turn may facilitate interpretation of the surface/structure
determination. Altogether, the results demonstrate that instantaneous
spatially resolved in situ measurements provide important information
for studies of the active phase and surface sites of catalysts, making
laser-induced fluorescence a highly valuable tool for catalysis research.
