Biosynthesis
of 6-deoxy sugars, including l-fucose, involves
a mechanistically complex, enzymatic 4,6-dehydration of hexose nucleotide
precursors as the first committed step. Here, we determined pre- and
postcatalytic complex structures of the human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase
at atomic resolution. These structures together with results of molecular
dynamics simulation and biochemical characterization of wildtype and
mutant enzymes reveal elusive mechanistic details of water elimination
from GDP-mannose C5″ and C6″, coupled to NADP-mediated
hydride transfer from C4″ to C6″. We show that concerted
acid–base catalysis from only two active-site groups, Tyr179 and Glu157, promotes a syn 1,4-elimination
from an enol (not an enolate) intermediate. We also show that the
overall multistep catalytic reaction involves the fewest position
changes of enzyme and substrate groups and that it proceeds under
conserved exploitation of the basic (minimal) catalytic machinery
of short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases.

==== Body
6-Deoxysugars, prominently represented
by the ubiquitous l-fucose,1 are
functionally important constituents
of complex glycans and glycosylated natural products. Their biosynthetic
pathways have in common that 4,6-dehydration of a hexose nucleotide
precursor constitutes the first committed step.2,3 The l-fucose (as GDP-l-fucose) is derived from GDP-d-mannose through an evolutionary conserved route via GDP-6-deoxy-α-d-lyxo-hexopyranos-4-ulose (GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose).4−6 GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) catalyzes the conversion of GDP-mannose.5 The basic mechanism of GMD appears to be universally
used by sugar 4,6-dehydratases.2,3 It involves three catalytic
steps (Figure 1a).
The GDP-mannose is initially oxidized at C4″ by a NADP+ cofactor tightly bound to the enzyme. Water is eliminated
from GDP-α-d-lyxo-hexopyranos-4-ulose
(GDP-4″-keto-mannose) at C5″ and C6″ to form
a GDP-6-deoxy-β-l-erythro-hex-5-enopyranos-4-ulose
(GDP-4″-keto-mannos-5″,6″-ene) intermediate.
Reduction of this intermediate by NADPH at C6″ gives the product
and regenerates NADP+.7,8

catalytic steps. (b) Stepwise mechanism of β-elimination of

The dehydratase reaction has drawn much interest in structural2,7,9−20 and biochemical studies7,8,10,19,21−27 spanning several decades to elucidate the enzymatic mechanism. Sugar
4,6-dehydratases are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase
protein superfamily.28 Their active sites
are equipped with the basic SDR (short-chain dehydrogenase and reductase)
catalytic apparatus for oxidation–reduction by NAD(P), which
has been well characterized from other enzymes.22,29,30 Accordingly, central problem in our mechanistic
understanding of the dehydratase reaction is to elucidate how enzymes
integrate a unique β-elimination of water with an apparently
“classical” SDR cycle of catalytic hydride transfer
to and from NAD(P).10,13,24,23,31 However, the
switch from alcohol oxidation in the first step of the catalytic reaction
to C–C double-bond reduction in the last step (Figure 1a) is another unique feature
of the sugar 1,4-dehydratases that is not well understood mechanistically.10

Chemically, β-elimination of a ketone
by enzyme catalysis
is likely to proceed stepwise, with Cα-H bond cleavage before
the Cβ-O bond cleavage. Considering thermodynamic requirements
for the Cα-H bond cleavage, Gerlt and Gassman31 refuted enzymatic reaction via base-catalyzed abstraction
of the α-proton to form a carbanion (enolate). They proposed
a concerted general acid–general base-catalyzed formation of
an enol intermediate from which 1,4-elimination of the β-substituent
could occur (Figure 1b). They also considered that, given suitable geometry of the enzyme–substrate
complex as shown in Figure 1b, the conjugate acid of the base catalyzing the enol formation
could also catalyze expulsion of the β-substituent. The proposed
mechanism implies a syn stereochemical course for
the β-elimination reaction and suggests two as the minimal number
of functional groups required for efficient catalysis. Herein, we
sought to clarify through study of the human GMD (UniProt accession
ID: O60547), whether—and if so to what extent—Gerlt and Gassman’s
minimum catalytic principle for β-elimination31 was in fact incorporated by an actual sugar 1,4-dehydratase
that has emerged from evolution through natural selection. We show,
based on high-resolution pre- and postcatalytic complex structures
of the enzyme, that human GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (hGMD) represents
a perfect realization of that principle in its most parsimonious form.
We suggest that other sugar 1,4-dehydratases like dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase13,24 employ the same principle, but in an expanded version.

Our
mechanistic analysis builds on four high-resolution crystal
structures of hGMD determined in this study (Table S1, Figure 2): the wildtype enzyme in complex with the inactive substrate analogue
GDP-4″-deoxy-4″-fluoro-mannose (PDB: 6GPJ, 1.94 Å); the
inactive E157Q variant in complex with GDP-mannose (PDB: 6GPK, 1.47 Å); the
wildtype enzyme in complex with the product GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose
(PDB: 6GPL,
1.76 Å); and the S156D variant in complex with GDP-mannose and
ADP-ribose (PDB: 6Q94, 2.8 Å). In capturing at atomic resolution the start and end
point of the enzymatic reaction, these structures together with biochemical
data and evidence from molecular dynamics simulation make detailed
suggestion for the catalytic path from substrate to product. It is
exactly this important fundamental insight which has been difficult
to obtain from previous structural studies on sugar 1,4-dehydratases
that could reveal the enzyme–substrate complex13,15,16 or enzyme complexes with substrate/product
analogue.13,14,17

product of NADP+ (white). Hydrogen bonds are shown as dashed
black lines, with distances indicated in Å. The 2FO–FC electron density
maps of the final structure (gray) are contoured at 2σ and are
clipped around the ligands.

Crystals of hGMD (Figure 2a) contain two to four homodimers in the asymmetric
unit,
with subunits arranged side to side in an opposite up-and-down orientation.
Each subunit adopts the characteristic SDR fold, composed of a prominent
Rossman-fold domain for NADP+ binding to which a smaller
GDP-Man binding domain is appended (for a detailed structural description,
see Figures S3 and S4). The active site
is in a cleft at the interface of the two domains. The two actives
sites are separate one from another in the dimer structure (Figure 2a), apparently functioning
independently in catalysis. However, there is cooperativity between
the subunits for tight binding of NADP+. The loop of residues
55–63 extends into the neighboring subunit and locks down on
the NADP+ bound (Figure S3),
as seen similarly in prokaryotic and plant GMDs.14,18 Movement away by this loop and dimer disruption would be necessary
for NADP+ to dissociate. The E157Q structure captures the
loop (residues 70–78) for binding of the allosteric inhibitor
GDP-l-fucose in the same conformation as shown in the GDP-l-fucose complex of wildtype hGMD32 (Figure 2a; for details,
see Figure S4), despite the fact that no
GDP-l-fucose is present. The inhibitor loop is disordered
in the two wildtype structures reported here. Although not the main
focus of this study, the result bears immediate significance for hGMD
inhibition. Conformational sampling, rather than induced fit, by GDP-l-fucose is suggested as the structural principle of inhibitor
binding in hGMD. The inhibition entails cooperativity between the
protein subunits, as shown in Figure S4. Its mechanistic basis is that GDP-l-fucose binding blocks
the entrance to the GDP-mannose binding pocket of the opposing chain.

For structural characterization of the hGMD Michaelis complex (Figure 2b,c), we first targeted
the native enzyme. In search for an unreactive substrate analog, we
considered substituting the 4-hydroxy group of α-mannosyl with
fluorine. While rendering the substrate incompetent for catalytic
turnover, the substitution arguably causes only weak perturbation
of the enzyme–substrate interactions originally present.33−35 We therefore developed a synthesis for GDP-4″-deoxy-4″-fluoro-mannose
(Figure S5) and show with isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC; Figure S6) that the fluorinated
ligand binds to hGMD with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.6 (±0.1) μM, comparable to the 8 (±1)
μM Km (∼Kd, vide infra) for GDP-mannose. In a second approach,
we targeted the native substrate, necessitating the construction of
an inactive hGMD variant (E157Q). The atomic maps of catalytic center
interactions shown in the wildtype complex with GDP-4″-deoxy-4″-fluoro-mannose
(Figure 2b,c) and in
the E157Q complex with GDP-mannose (Figure 2f) are consistent and are mutually supportive
in suggesting a positioning of the substrate for catalysis. This demonstrates
important complementarity in the approaches used.

The hGMD active
site is composed of a canonical SDR catalytic triad
(Tyr179, Thr155, Lys183) for alcohol
oxidation by NADP+, extended by three residues (Glu157, Ser156, Asn208) promoting β-elimination.
Tyr179 and Thr155 each form a hydrogen bond
with the substituent at α-mannosyl C4″ (fluorine, Figure 2b,c; hydroxy, Figure 2f; overlay in Figure S7a). The nicotinamide C4 is above the
substrate C4″, with distance (3.5–3.7 Å) and angle
(77°–83°; relative to the nicotinamide ring C4–N1
axis) well set for hydride transfer.9,10 Lys183 establishes a highly conserved SDR proton relay:36 a chain of hydrogen bonds connects Tyr179 (the
catalytic acid/base) via the ribosyl hydroxy group and the ε-amino
group of lysine to water (Figure S8). The
hGMD is special in that its proton relay does not connect to bulk
water, but ends in a reservoir of water molecules buried inside the
protein (Figure S8). Glu157,
Ser156, and Asn208 each forms a hydrogen bond
with the C6″ hydroxy group. The orientation of the hydroxy
group is in accordance with a β-elimination having syn stereochemical course.

The structure of hGMD bound with the
GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose
(Figure 2d,e) suggests
a true postcatalytic complex captured in the crystal. A water molecule,
likely the one eliminated from the C6″, is held in place by
Glu157, Ser156, and Asn208. The nicotinamide
C4 is positioned above the C6″, with distance (3.2 Å)
and angle (116°; relative to the C4–N1 axis) both proper
for hydride transfer. Tyr179 and Thr155 form
a hydrogen bond (2.7 Å each) with the C4″ keto group of
product. Comparing the product (Figure 2d,e) to the substrate complex structure (Figure 2b,c), the product C6″
has made a 1.1 Å upward movement and is now favorably positioned
for hydride transfer to the coenzyme (Figure S9). Apart from this subtle change, all atomic positions defining the
catalytic center interactions are effectively the same in substrate
and product complex (Figure S7; Figure S9). Therefore, hGMD seems to accommodate the different catalytic steps
of its overall reaction (Figure 1a) without the need for repositioning of the enzyme
and substrate groups, thus conforming to the “principle of
least nuclear motion” in enzyme catalysis. The central, nearly
parallel orientation of the nicotinamide ring to the sugar ring plane
determines the strict 1,4-reductive regioselectivity of hGMD. In contrast,
as pointed out in study of the hexosamine nucleotide 5,6-dehydratase
TunA, a 1,2-selective hydride addition (to reduce the 4″-keto
moiety) would necessitate the ring planes to lie in certain angle
(observed: 22°) to each other.19

Gerlt and Gassman’s mechanism (Figure 1b) built into hGMD implies a 4,5-enolization
of GDP-4″-keto-mannose under concerted general acid–general
base catalysis from Tyr179 and Glu157, respectively.37 In both enzyme structures reporting on the Michaelis
complex (Figure 2b,f),
however, the Glu157 is hydrogen bonded to the C6″
hydroxy group. Molecular dynamics simulations of enzyme complex with
NADPH and the enol (GDP-mannos-4″,5″-ene) intermediate
show that in 21% of 150 structure snapshots analyzed over a total
runtime of 15 ns, the Glu157 approaches the C5″
at a distance (∼3.5 Å) plausible for catalytic proton
transfer at this position (Figure 3a, for details, see Figures S12 and S13 as well as Table S2).38 In the remainder time of the simulation, the
Glu157 is in contact with the C6″ hydroxy group.
The side-chain conformational flexibility thus revealed is essential
for Glu157 to function as catalytic base during the enol
formation and, in conjugate acid form, as catalytic acid during the
expulsion of water, as proposed in Figure 3a,c.

Figure 3 Proposed catalytic mechanism of hGMD. (a) Proton
abstraction from
the C5″ by Glu157 is suggested by results of molecular dynamics
simulations. A structure snapshot (3.1 ns) of the complex of wildtype
hGMD bound with NADPH and GDP-mannos-4″,5″-ene shows
Glu157 in a position suitable for proton transfer. (b) Proton relay
or proton uptake from bulk water in the final ketone-forming step
of the reaction is shown. (c) Detailed proposal of the catalytic mechanism.

With β-elimination complete,
the conversion of the GDP-4″-keto-mannos-5″,6″-ene
intermediate to the GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose product
likely proceeds in two steps, representing in opposite order the reversal
of the previous catalytic steps of oxidation and enolization (Figure 3c). Accordingly,
hydride reduction at C6″ proceeds under catalytic facilitation
by Tyr179 as the general acid and gives the 4,5-enol (Figure 3c), consistent with
computational analysis of a small-molecule model of the dehydratase
reduction step.10 The ketone formation
involves concerted catalysis by Tyr179 and Glu157 and results in proton transfer from water via Glu157 to
the C5″. Our structural analysis of hGMD reveals the path of
proton uptake from bulk water (Figure 3b), and it shows this previously unrecognized path
to be largely conserved in other sugar dehydratases (Figure S11).

Mutagenesis combined with measurement of
C5″ deuterium exchange,
using method adopted from Gross et al.,23 provides biochemical support to the mechanistic claim that Tyr179 and Glu157 provide concerted catalysis to enol
formation. We show with in situ proton NMR that upon incubation in
D2O in the presence of the GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose
product, the wildtype enzyme catalyzes rapid “wash-in”
of solvent deuterium at C5″ (Figure 4a,c, Table 1) while E157Q (Figure 4b, Table 1) and Y179F are inactive (Figure S27, Table 1).

at C5″ catalyzed by wildtype hGMD. Note: signal change from
doublet to singlet for H6″ was more conveniently analyzed than
signal decrease for H5″. The signal for H5″ was partly
overlapped in the 1H-NMR spectra of GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose.
(b) The H6″ doublets remain unchanged during incubation with

and 4″-diol forms are present at a ratio of about 3:1.

Having shown that hGMD represents,
in a most elementary form, Gerlt
and Gassman’s chemical principle of catalytic β-elimination
of a ketone (cf. Figure 1b and Figure 3c),
we investigated a conspicuous structural variation in sugar 1,4-dehydratase
active sites: dTDP-glucose dehydratase has an aspartic acid residue13,23,24 in place of Ser156 in hGMD (Figure S10). We find that the
S156D variant of hGMD is inactive toward GDP-mannose but promotes
C5″ deuterium exchange in GDP-4″-keto-6″-deoxy-mannose
at half the rate of the wildtype enzyme (Figure S28, Table 1). The structure of S156D in complex with GDP-mannose (2.8 Å; Figure 2e, Table S1) shows electron density for the substrate and for
2′-phospho-ADP-ribose (a cleavage product of NADP+). Lacking coordination with Asp156, the C6″ hydroxy
group of GDP-mannose adopts a pseudoaxial position which conflicts
with the presence of the nicotinamide ring. Although redox chemistry
is thus rendered impossible for the S156D variant, its Tyr179 and Glu157 are in plausible positions to catalyze enol
formation in the product. We additionally show that a S156A variant
retains activity with GDP-mannose (12% of wildtype, Figure S26) but is much slower (13-fold) in C5″ deuterium
exchange (Figure S29, Table 1) than the S156D variant. It
is also significant that hGMD turns over at a ∼10-fold slower
rate (kcat = 0.42 s–1; Table 1, Figure S25) than dTDP-glucose dehydratase does.

In hGMD, the reduced NADPH form of the enzyme is not detectably
present in the reaction at steady state (Figure S18). The kcat is therefore limited
by a substrate oxidation that either is slow intrinsically or occurs
kinetically coupled to a subsequent step, likely the enolization,
that leads to an internal equilibrium far on the side of enzyme-bound
GDP-mannose. Although beyond the scope of the current investigation,
kinetic isotope effects could be useful to distinguish between these
kinetic scenarios for hGMD. In contrast to hGMD, the 4.9 s–1kcat of dTDP-glucose dehydratase is
limited partly by dTDP-4″,5″-glucosene reduction25 and the reaction involves enzyme-NADH (45% of
total)27 at steady state. On the basis
of these considerations, we think that nature’s mechanistic
rationale for having Asp instead of Ser in the 4,6-dehydratase catalytic
apparatus might have been to drive the oxidation-enolization by making
proton abstraction from C5″ to the enzyme thermodynamically
more favorable, as shown in Figure S30.
With the pKa of the catalytic Glu increased
in the presence of the neighboring Asp, as analogously observed in
other enzymes,39−41 the energetic barrier to the enol formation might
be reduced effectively. A speeding up of the catalytic reaction thus
achievable might benefit the enzyme function in particular physiological
contexts.

In summary, therefore, this mechanistic account of
hGMD advances
the detailed understanding of hexose dehydration by a class of sugar
1,4-dehydratases. This is broadly relevant regarding the enzymology
of 6-deoxy-sugar biosynthesis. It also provides important insight
into the evolution of enzyme structure, function, and mechanism in
a superfamily wide context of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases.

The Tyr179 is ideally
positioned to function
as the catalytic general acid. Studies of the related dTDP-glucose
dehydratase18 suggest a pKa for the enzyme tyrosine (pKa ∼ 6.6) well suited for protonation of the incipient enol
(pKa ∼ 11).


With an equilibrium lying far on the side
of ketone, the enolization is expected from the Hammond postulate
to involve a product (enol)-like transition state (see ref (31)). We therefore used GDP-mannos-4,5-ene
for our molecular dynamics simulations.
