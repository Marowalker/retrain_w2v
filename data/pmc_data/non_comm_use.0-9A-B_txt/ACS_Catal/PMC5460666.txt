Particulate matter
and NOx emissions
from diesel exhaust remains one of the most pressing environmental
problems. We explore the use of hierarchically ordered mixed Fe–Ce–Zr
oxides for the simultaneous capture and oxidation of soot and reduction
of NOx by ammonia in a single step. The
optimized material can effectively trap the model soot particles in
its open macroporous structure and oxidize the soot below 400 °C
while completely removing NO in the 285–420 °C range.
Surface characterization and DFT calculations emphasize the defective
nature of Fe-doped ceria. The isolated Fe ions and associated oxygen
vacancies catalyze facile NO reduction to N2. A mechanism
for the reduction of NO with NH3 on Fe-doped ceria is proposed
involving adsorbed O2. Such adsorbed O2 species
will also contribute to the oxidation of soot.

Introduction
Air pollution caused
by exhaust gas emissions from various modes
of transportation carries significant risk for human health and the
environment.1−4 Introduced in the 1970s, the three-way catalytic convertor has become
a widespread technology for removing noxious gases from gasoline-fueled
cars.5 Precious group metals (PGMs) dispersed
as nanoparticles on suitable oxide support materials can simultaneously
oxidize CO and hydrocarbons and reduce NOx to less harmful gases. This technology cannot be used to remove
NOx from the exhaust of diesel engines
because it is too rich in oxygen. Aside from NOx, diesel exhaust remains a major contributor to undesirable
emissions of particulate matter (PM). Soot particles pose the most
serious threat to human health. The major challenge in diesel exhaust
cleanup is the removal of NOx under lean
(oxygen-rich) conditions.6,7 Yoshida et al. were
the first to propose the simultaneous removal of PM and NOx by a single catalytic material.8 Significant efforts have been made to develop suitable
catalysts for this purpose.9 Current commercial
solutions combine a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) for the removal
of CO and hydrocarbons, a catalyzed diesel particulate filter (CDPF)
for soot filtration, and a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) step
to remove NOx using a reducing gas such
as ammonia. These operations are carried out in different compartments,
thereby increasing the size and cost of this technology. Another drawback
is that in some steps expensive PGMs such as Pt are important catalyst
ingredients.10,11 Consequently, there is significant
incentive to develop novel approaches that rely on more abundant elements
and combine one or more pollutant conversion steps.12

A potential alternative is to combine the CDPF and
SCR functions
in a selective catalytic reduction and particulate filter (SCRPF).
The particular challenge here is to achieve a high rate of soot oxidation
in combination with substantial NOx reduction
at sufficiently low temperature. Therefore, it is necessary to identify
materials with suitable redox abilities. Candidate materials are (mixed)
metal oxides,13,14 hydrotalcites,15 and alkali oxides.16 Besides
high activity, increasing the contact area between the catalysts and
solid reactant is a particular challenge in this field.17,18 It is also important that the texture of these materials be suitable
for capturing soot particles, which are typically larger than 25 nm.
In such case, hierarchically structured oxides may be considered.
Three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) materials offer an
ordered, interconnected macroporous structure with openings suitable
for the capture of soot particles.19

Ceria is well-known for its excellent oxygen storage capacity.20,21 The problem of low high-temperature stability of ceria structures
can be overcome by introducing foreign elements into the ceria lattice,
which also improves its redox properties.22−25 For instance, Ce–Zr mixed
oxides have been explored in the context of NOx reduction and soot oxidation.26−32 Other reports have already shown that doping Fe into ceria improves
its reducibility, leading to more facile generation of oxygen vacancies
at the surface important for soot oxidation and NOx reduction.33,34

Herein, we report for the
first time an Fe-doped 3DOM mixed Ce–Zr
oxide material that can simultaneously remove PM and NOx from diesel exhaust. Ammonia is used as a reductant
for NOx. We prepared the 3DOM mixed oxides
by a carbon-templating method and varied the Fe content in the mixed
oxide. Optimized materials show good performance in simultaneous removal
of soot and NOx at intermediate temperatures.
The 3DOM mixed oxides are thermally stable and can be repeatedly regenerated
without loss of activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
have been performed to understand the surface reducibility of the
mixed oxides and gain insight into the role of Fe and surface oxygen
vacancies in the reaction mechanism of NOx reduction and soot oxidation.

Experimental Section
Materials
Synthesis
All starting chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Carboxy-modified
poly(methyl methacrylate) (c-PMMA) spheres were prepared by a modified
emulsifier-free biphasic emulsion polymerization technique using initiators
for the water and oil phase.35−37 Methyl methacrylate (MMA, 99%)
was the monomer used for obtaining PMMA spheres. Addition of acrylic
acid (AA, >99%) monomer to the mixture allowed for introducing
carboxyl
groups in the PMMA. Briefly, a four-necked, 1000 mL round-bottomed
flask was filled a mixed solution of acetone (80 mL, >98%), distilled
water (240 mL), and the monomers (120 mL). The resulting mixture was
heated to 80 °C by a hot water bath. After approximately 30 min,
0.6 g of potassium persulfate (KPS, water-phase initiator, >99%)
and
0.15 g of azodiisobutyronitrile (AIBN, oil-phase initiator, 98%) mixed
with 40 mL of distilled water (preheated to 80 °C) were added.
The whole solution was stirred at a constant speed of 350 min–1 for approximately 2 h with N2 bubbling.
The obtained latex was cooled to room temperature and then centrifuged.
The solid material was dried at room temperature (c-PMMA).

Three-dimensionally
ordered macroporous (3DOM) Ce0.9–xFexZr0.1O2 catalysts
were prepared by carboxy-modified colloidal crystal templating (CMCCT).
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.5%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (99.99%), and ZrOCl2·8H2O (98%) were used as precursors for obtaining
mixed metal oxides. Suitable amounts of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O, Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and ZrOCl2·8H2O were first dissolved
in a mixture of ethylene glycol and methanol followed by vigorous
stirring for 40 min. Then, this solution was contacted with the c-PMMA
hard template for 12 h. After impregnation, the final material was
subjected to vacuum filtration to remove excess precursor solution.
The precipitate was dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven, calcined
in inert (Ar) atmosphere at 130 °C for 1 h, followed by increasing
the temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min. After a
dwell time of 5 h, the atmosphere was changed to air, and the sample
was kept at 600 °C for another 3 h. The first step in Ar pyrolyzes
the carbon: the sp2-hybridized carbon atoms are converted
to a sturdy amorphous carbon material, which acts as the hard template
for the in situ formation of the 3DOM mixed oxide. The carbon template
was finally removed by calcination in air.

Catalyst Characterization
The crystal structure of
the samples was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrometer
(Shimadzu XRD 6000) with Cu Kα radiation (0.02° intervals
in the range 5–90° at a rate of 4°/min). Nitrogen
adsorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics TriStar-II
3020 instrument. SEM (FEI Quanta200F) was conducted to analyze the
surface morphology of the samples. The microstructure and lattice
parameters were analyzed by TEM (JEOL JEM 2100 electron microscope).
Raman spectra were collected in the anti-Stokes range of 100–2000
cm–1 using an inVia Reflex-Renishaw spectrometer.
The sample was excited using a He–Gd laser (532 nm excitation
wavelength). X-ray photoelectron spectra were measured on an XPSPHI-1600
ESCA spectrometer using an Al Kα anode (hν
= 1253.6 eV) as the X-ray source and using C 1s at 284.6 eV as an
internal binding energy standard. Temperature-programmed desorption
of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out in a conventional
flow apparatus using a thermal conductivity detector. Temperature-programmed
reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) measurements was
performed in an Autosorb IQ Quantachrome apparatus.

Catalytic Activity
Measurements
Catalytic activity
measurements were taken in a fixed-bed reactor. Printex U carbon black
(Orion Engineered Carbons) was used as a model for particulate matter.
This carbon black has an average particle size of 25 nm and surface
area of 100 m2/g. Prior to each catalytic activity test,
100 mg of catalyst and 10 mg of Printex U were mixed gently with a
spatula (loose contact mode). Thereafter, the mixture was placed between
quartz wool plugs in a quartz tubular reactor with an inner diameter
of 10 mm. The reactor feed was comprised of 1000 ppm of NO, 1000 ppm
of NH3, and 3% O2 with N2 as the
balance gas. In some cases, 5% H2O was added to the reactor
feed to evaluate the influence of moisture. The gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) was 25,000 h–1 with a total flow of 100 mL/min
at standard pressure and temperature. The performance of the optimum
catalyst was also evaluated at higher GHSV by decreasing the catalyst
amount. The concentrations of NH3, NO, NO2,
N2O, CO2, and CO were monitored at the outlet
by online infrared spectroscopy (Thermo Is50 FTIR equipped with a
2.4 m gas cell). For quantification, a robust method for multicomponent
gas analysis was used implementing TQ Analyst software and making
use of calibration curves based on mixtures of the relevant gases
in different concentration ranges.38 Before
each catalytic activity measurement, the catalyst sample was first
swept by a flow of 100 mL/min N2 for approximately 45 min
prior to collecting a background IR spectrum of the reactor effluent.
Afterward, effluent IR spectra were recorded of the reactor feed consisting
of 1000 ppm of NH3, 1000 ppm of NO, and 3% O2 in N2 for 30 min. Catalytic activity tests were carried
out by heating the reactor bed from 30 to 600 °C at a rate of
3 °C/min. The stability of the catalyst was evaluated by repeatedly
evaluating its performance in this manner. For this purpose, 10 mg
of Printex U was mixed with the catalyst bed. The absence of mass
transfer limitations for the NO reduction reaction was verified by
applying the Koros–Nowak criterion, and the absence of heat
transfer due to soot oxidation was evaluated by Mears’ criteria
(see the Supporting Information).

Computational
Methods
DFT calculations were performed
using the VASP code employing the GGA-PBE exchange-correlation potential.39 The valence electrons (5s, 4f, 3d for Ce; 2s,
2p for O; and 4s, 3d for Fe) were expanded in a plane-wave basis set
with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The projector augmented wave method
(PAW) was used to describe the effect of core electrons.40,41 The bulk equilibrium lattice constant of ceria (5.49 Å) previously
calculated by PBE + U (Ueff = 4.5 eV) was uSed.42 Then, a 3 × 3 surface unit cell was used
for the CeO2 (111) surface. Fe atoms and the six top atomic
layers of the ceria slab were allowed to relax, whereas the three
bottom layers were kept fixed to their bulk positions. The vacuum
gap thickness was set to 15 Å. Because of the large size of the
slab model (11.64 Å × 11.64 Å), a Monkhorst pack 1
× 1 × 1 mesh was used for Brillouin zone integration. All
structures were relaxed until the forces acting on each atom were
smaller than 0.05 eV/Å. To improve the description of the on-site
Coulomb interactions in the Ce-f states and Fe-d states, a Hubbard
correction was added. For Ce, a value of Ueff = 4.5 eV
was used for its 4f orbital.43−45 For Fe, a value of Ueff = 3.8 eV was used for its 3d orbital.46 The location and energy of transition states were calculated with
the climbing-image nudged elastic band method (CINEB).47 Adsorption energies are expressed with reference
to the adsorbing molecule in vacuum. The energies of all gas species
were determined in a 15 Å cubic box with a cutoff energy of 400
eV at the Γ-point.

Results and Discussion
Preparation and Characterization
The carboxy-modified
variation of colloidal crystal templating using poly(methyl methacrylate)
(c-PMMA) spheres is schematically depicted in Figure 1.35 The sturdy
amorphous carbon material derived from PMMA pyrolysis can be used
as a hard template for the fabrication of structured metal oxides.48 The carboxy modification of PMMA using acrylic
acid as a comonomer was necessary to obtain a well-mixed Ce–Zr
oxide structure. We prepared c-PMMA spheres by copolymerization of
MMA and AA using suitable initiators. Centrifuging and drying of the
latex resulted in a highly ordered c-PMMA material. The structured
oxides were obtained by impregnation of the solid organic template
with a mixture of suitable precursor salts dissolved in a mixture
of ethylene glycol and methanol followed by pyrolysis at 600 °C
in inert and calcination in air to remove the organic part. TEM images
show the ordered texture of the optimum Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 mixed oxide with macropores and uniformly
sized walls (Figure 1b–d) interconnected by smaller windows.49 All materials have the fluorite structure of ceria independent
of the Fe and Zr content, and no separate iron or zirconium oxide
phases were detected by XRD (Figure S2).
Small shifts in the main diffraction peaks for the mixed oxides compared
to CeO2 evidence inclusion of Fe3+ and Zr4+ into the fluorite structure of ceria. High-resolution TEM
images show (111) surface terminations with the d-spacing being consistent
with that of ceria (Figure 1e).

Ce–Fe–Zr oxide and its catalytic function in diesel
exhaust cleanup; (b) SEM and (c–e) TEM images at different
magnifications showing the macroporous structure (c, d) and d-spacing
of CeO2(111).

Introduction of Fe and Zr into the CeO2 lattice
did
not alter the 3DOM structure as long as the Fe substitution level
was kept below 0.2 (Figures S3 and S4).
Introduction of more Fe led to segregated iron oxides observable in
high-resolution TEM images (Figure 2).50 Raman spectra of the
3DOM Ce0.9–xFexZr0.1O2 samples contain an absorption
band at ∼460 cm–1 due to the F2g mode of CeO2 (Figure 3).24,51 Only at higher Fe content (x ≥ 0.2) did Raman bands at 215 and 280 cm–1 typical of Fe–O stretching vibrations in Fe oxides appear.
The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms show a nearly
linear correlation between the relative pressure and absorbed volume
(Figure S4), which is the consequence of
unrestricted monolayer-multilayer adsorption. The presence of an H3
hysteresis loop is further indication of the macroporous structure.
Although the pure ceria material has a surface area of approximately
12 m2/g (Table S1), the mixed
oxides have higher surface area, which is in part due to the presence
of mesopores evident from the hysteresis in the p/p0 range between 0.4 and 0.8. These
mesopores are likely occluded in the walls of the macroporous material.

Catalytic Activity Measurements
Compared with ceria,
mixed Ce–Zr oxides display better thermal stability and oxygen
storage capacity, which is beneficial for PM combustion.52 In general, it is a challenge to reduce NOx under the oxygen-rich conditions required
to oxidize PM into CO2.53 As
NO2 is more effective in soot oxidation than O2, soot is usually first oxidized in the NOx/O2 exhaust gas, followed by ammonia-assisted NOx reduction using, for instance, Cu/zeolites
placed downstream of the PM combustion zone.54−57 Ammonia can be conveniently supplied
to the after-treatment system by hydrolyzing urea. It has been demonstrated
before that Fe is an active ingredient for NOx reduction.58

We optimized
the Fe and Zr content of the 3DOM mixed Fe–Ce–Zr oxide
toward low-temperature NOx reduction and
complete soot oxidation. For this purpose, model soot particles with
an average size of 25 nm were loosely mixed with the 3DOM mixed oxide
catalysts and exposed to a simulated diesel exhaust feed containing
1000 ppm of NO, 1000 ppm of NH3, and 3% O2 with
balance N2 fed at a GHSV of 25,000 h–1. The loose contact mode provides a better approximation of soot
trapping in a DPF than tight contact conditions involving grinding
the components in a mortar.7Figure 4 shows the transient behavior
of the catalyst during temperature-programmed reaction. CO2 is produced by combustion of the model soot particles. The effluent
CO2 concentration decreases at high temperature, as combustion
of the model soot near completion. NO conversion at high temperature
is limited because of the oxidation of NH3 (Figure S5). In low temperature NH3–SCR, NO oxidation to NO2 is crucial to improve
the rate of NOx removal via the fast SCR
reaction.59,60 Moreover, NO2 is also a more
active soot oxidant than NO.61 The 3DOM
Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 catalyst
shows excellent activity in the oxidation of NO to NO2 (Figure S6). The optimal catalyst Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 is effective for reducing
NO by 90% in the range of 265–420 °C and for completely
oxidizing soot to CO2 at approximately 375 °C. Among
the 3DOM mixed Fe–Ce–Zr–O catalysts (Table 1), the optimized material
is able to oxidize coke below 400 °C. When the Fe content is
too high, the performance was much lower because segregated Fe oxides
block the surface of the solid Fe–Ce–Zr–O solution.62 Consistent with this, Fe2O3 itself showed low activity in PM oxidation and NOx SCR.

c Temperature range where NO conversion
is complete.

We also evaluated
the performance of the catalyst in the presence
of water. Adding 5% H2O to the reactor feed, the catalytic
performance for PM oxidation was decreased, whereas that for NOx reduction was only slightly lower in comparison
to the experiments without water (Figure S7). Complete reduction of NO was achieved in the 343–426 °C
range, and soot was completely combusted at 421 °C. Clearly,
water had a negative effect on low-temperature NO conversion but improved
NO reduction rate at high temperature. The strong influence of water
on NO reduction is due to competitive adsorption of NH3 and H2O. This limits NH3 adsorption on acid
sites at low temperature, thus decreasing low temperature NOx reduction. On the other hand, at high temperature,
the inhibiting effect of H2O slows NH3 oxidation,
resulting in a higher NOx reduction rate.

As the used space velocity was relatively low with respect to diesel
exhaust gas treatment, we also evaluated the performance of the optimum
3DOM Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 at higher space velocities (GHSV of 50,000 and 100,000 h–1). Figure S8 shows that under these more
stringent conditions catalytic performance was decreased. Complete
NOx conversion was still obtained in the
338–420 °C temperature range at a GHSV of 50,000 h–1, whereas at the highest GHSV, the maximum NO conversion
was limited to 80%. The PM combustion rate displayed maxima at 407
and 435 °C for GHSV values of 50,000 and 100,000 h–1.

Figure 5 shows
that
the optimized 3DOM Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 catalyst can be reused without loss of activity for
five consecutive cycles with fresh model soot being added after each
cycle. Because the ceramic materials may be exposed to high temperatures
in real applications, we also aged the optimum 3DOM mixed oxide at
900 °C in air for 5 h. This had only a minor effect on the catalytic
performance (Figure S9) with the maximum
rate of soot combustion being observed at 398 °C and full NO
conversion in the 327–420 °C range. SEM shows that the
texture of the 3DOM mixed oxide is largely retained, emphasizing its
good thermal stability (Figure S10). Comparison
of the catalytic performance of the optimum 3DOM catalyst to literature
data emphasizes the outstanding performance in combined soot oxidation
and NO reduction (Table S2). SEM images
of the original and the catalyst used in five consecutive cycles demonstrates
that the structured mixed oxide is thermally stable in the experiments
(Figure 6).

optimal 3DOM Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 catalyst during five consecutive cycles (the

N2, 0.1 model soot/catalyst mass ratio).

conditions: GHSV = 25,000 h–1, 1000 ppm of NH3, 1000 ppm of NO, 3% O2 in N2, 0.1 model
soot/catalyst mass ratio).

Figure 5 also
displays
the performance of a nontemplated mixed oxide of the same composition
as the optimal one. Soot combustion is delayed too much at higher
temperatures, presumably because of the much less efficient contact
of the soot particles with the surface of the mixed oxide. PM oxidation
can enhance NOx reduction by involving
C=O groups on soot, which are intermediates in the complete
oxidation of soot.63 Compared with the
large pores of the 3DOM structure, the average pore size of the nontemplated
mixed oxide is only 15.8 nm, too small for the model soot particles
to enter. Thus, the soot particles can only interact with a much smaller
portion of the mixed oxide surface. The strong influence of the texture
together with the use of the loose mixing method suggests that the
model soot particles will enter the pores of the 3DOM structure during
the performance test. This supposition is confirmed by studying a
3DOM sample that was only heated to 250 °C. Figure 6 shows TEM images of the model
soot as well as a soot particle trapped in the large pores of the
3DOM structure after heating to 250 °C. On the other hand, the
rate of reduction of NO was substantially lower for the nonstructured
mixed oxide catalyst. As its surface area is higher than that of the
3DOM mixed oxide, the lower performance suggests that the surface
of the nontemplated mixed oxide has a different composition, likely
containing fewer Fe sites.

Temperature-programmed reduction
(H2-TPR) profiles of
3DOM Ce0.9–xFexZr0.1O2 catalysts demonstrate the better
reducibility of the Fe-doped Ce–Zr mixed oxides compared with
CeO2 and Ce–Zr oxide (Figure 7). The 3DOM ceria sample shows two reduction
maxima at 550 and 820 °C due to surface and bulk reduction. The
mixed CeZrO2 sample shows one reduction feature at 591
°C. Inclusion of Zr in the ceria lattice is known to increase
the reducibility of the bulk of ceria.64,65 An additional
low-temperature reduction feature in the 425–476 °C range
appears in the Fe-doped mixed oxides. It occurs at the lowest temperature
for the best-performing Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 sample. The high-temperature reduction features observed
for samples at higher Fe content are due to reduction of Fe2O3.66,67 In line with the low NO SCR performance
of the nontemplated mixed oxide, TPR shows that the surface reduction
occurs at relatively high temperature and with relatively low hydrogen
consumption. This suggests that a relatively small part of Fe is built
into the ceria, indicating that the CMCCT method is conducive to generating
highly dispersed Fe species in the ceria surface.

DFT Calculations
To better understand how doping with
Fe enhances the reducibility of ceria and catalytic performance, we
performed DFT + U calculations using a CeO2 (111) surface
model in which one Ce atom was substituted by an Fe atom. We choose
the (111) surface, as it is the most stable termination of ceria.
We studied the oxygen formation energy of Fe-doped ceria as well as
a reaction mechanism for the oxidation of NO to N2 by NH3 and O2. Finally, we also discuss the role of adsorbed
O2 in the oxidation of coke.

Compared with the high
oxygen vacancy formation energy of the stoichiometric (111) surface
of ceria (2.1 eV, 1 eV ≈ 96 kJ/mol), removing an oxygen atom
from the Fe-doped CeO2(111) surface is exothermic by −0.10
eV. This result implies that the ceria surface will already contain
oxygen vacancies. The energy to remove a second O atom close to the
first one is 1.39 eV, which is still substantially lower than the
oxygen vacancy formation energy of the stoichiometric ceria surface.
Thus, the first reduction feature observed in the H2-TPR
traces of the Fe-doped samples is because of the removal of a second
O atom close to the Fe substitution. The DFT calculations predict
that removing this O atom results in two Ce3+ surface atoms
(Figure 8a). In keeping
with this, XPS confirms that the Fe-containing samples contain more
Ce3+ than the Fe-free reference sample (Table 2). The highest Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio was observed for the most active sample. XPS
also demonstrates that the surface contains the highest amount of
surface adsorbed oxygen in the form of O22– and O–. We speculate that the oxygen species at
higher binding energy are, because of molecular oxygen, strongly adsorbed
on oxygen vacancies in close proximity to the Fe dopant in the ceria
surface. DFT calculations show that molecular O2 strongly
adsorbs to the defective Fe-substituted ceria surface, forming O22– species (Eads = −0.71 eV, Figure 8b).

The
combined results of surface characterization and catalytic
testing emphasize the unique properties of Fe atoms doped into ceria
toward NO reduction with NH3 combined with soot oxidation.
To gain better insight into the role of ceria doping with Fe, we investigated
the mechanism of NO reduction by NH3 through DFT calculations
(Figure 9). We started
the catalytic cycle from the stable surface under oxygen-rich conditions,
i.e., the surface that contains O2 adsorbed on the oxygen
vacancy close to the Fe site (state i). NO strongly adsorbs on the
exposed Lewis acid Fe site (state ii, ΔEads = −2.15 eV). The adsorbed NO molecule will easily
react with a ceria lattice O atom to form nitrite (state iii). The
activation barrier determined by the climbing image nudged elastic
band method is 0.39 eV. Although state iii is slightly less stable
than state ii, the formation of the nitrite species allows NH3 to adsorb on the Lewis acid Fe site. This adsorption is strong
with ΔEads = −1.14 eV (state
iv). The formation of nitrite stores NO on the surface and alleviates
the competition between NO and NH3 for adsorption on the
catalytic surface. This Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is entropically
favored over the Eley–Rideal alternative involving direct reaction
of NO from the gas phase with a lattice O atom. NH3-TPD
confirms that ammonia is more strongly adsorbed on the Fe-doped samples
than on Fe-free samples (Figure S12).

energy diagram of NO reduction with key reaction intermediates.
State v and v′ represent N–H dissociation in adsorbed
NH3 by lattice O and adsorbed O2, respectively.

An aspect worth discussing is
that the adsorption of O2 on the oxygen vacancy oxidizes
Fe2+ to Fe3+. Consequently, NH3 adsorbs
stronger on the surface in
the presence of coadsorbed O2 (ΔEads,NH3 = −1.25 eV) than in its absence
(ΔEads,NH3 = −0.66
eV) (Figure 8b). Furthermore,
NO adsorption is stronger on Fe3+ (ΔEads,NO = −2.15 eV) than on Fe2+ (ΔEads,NO = −0.28 eV) (Figure 8b). Both effects are expected
to increase the rate of the NO SCR reaction.

The catalytic cycle
continues by reaction of the nitrite species
with adsorbed ammonia. First, one of the N–H bonds of chemisorbed
NH3 is activated by a basic O atom to form adsorbed OH
and NH2 surface species. Because of its higher basicity,
H abstraction by a ceria lattice O2– ion is preferred
(state v, ΔEreaction = 0.99 eV)
over abstraction by coadsorbed O22– (state
v′ represented in Figure 9, ΔEreaction = 1.55
eV). The resulting NH2 radical will then react with NO
to form ONNH2 as a reactive intermediate. The activation
barrier for this process is very low (ΔEbarrier = 0.21 eV). For the decomposition of this complex,
we follow the mechanism identified in gas phase cluster studies of
VO3 and V2O5 with NO and NH3.68−70 By abstraction of another H atom and proton transfer from the OH
group (ΔEreaction = 0.92 eV), the
HONNH surface intermediate is obtained, which weakly binds via its
OH moiety to the Fe site (state vii, ΔEads = 0.20 eV). Such intermediates are very unstable71 and decompose without activation barrier to
gaseous N2 and, in this case, two OH groups, one bridging
between two Ce ions and one coordinating to the Fe cation (state viii).
These reaction events are very exothermic (ΔEreaction = −3.76 eV). The surface then contains
three OH groups (the three H atoms originate from ammonia; the O atom
is one of the OH groups from NO). One OH group and one proton are
removed as water (state ix, ΔEdes = 1.4 eV). The proton left behind will remove an O atom from the
surface as water together with another proton obtained in a subsequent
similar reaction cycle. The energetics of subsequent cycles should
be very similar to the above-described cycle.72 Finally, the resulting O vacancies will be filled by dissociating
O2. Taken together, these reactions amount to the overall
4 NO + 4 NH3 + O2 → 4 N2 +
6 H2O reaction stoichiometry. The potential energy diagram
for the formation of the first part of the cycle is shown in Figure 9. Candidate rate-controlling
steps are the two proton abstraction steps (iv → v and vi →
vii) and water desorption (ix → x), as the latter step is facilitated
by the entropy gain of water desorbing from the surface. Therefore,
the present data suggest that the proton abstraction steps from ammonia
to the ceria surface are the most likely reaction steps that control
the overall reaction rate.

A second aspect of doping ceria with
Fe relates to the oxidation
of soot. Routine soot oxidation in CDPF is undergone before NO reduction
because NO2 produced by NO oxidation in the first step
is a stronger oxidant than O2. To evaluate the influence
of NO removal during soot oxidation, we carried out a soot oxidation
experiment without NO and NH3 in the feed (Figure S13). The activity of the catalyst was
slightly lower in this way, as evidenced by the small shift in the
CO2 production maximum to higher temperature (405 °C).
Nevertheless, the performance of the Ce0.8Fe0.1Zr0.1O2 catalyst under these conditions was
still outstanding compared to that of reference systems. This result
implies that the substitution of Fe into the ceria surface leads to
activated oxygen species that are involved in the oxidation of soot.
Although a thorough computational analysis of these aspects is beyond
the scope of this study, electronic analysis of adsorbed O2 on the defective Fe-substituted ceria model (state i) and stoichiometric
ceria shows nearly similar energetics with a formal O2– state. However, comparison of the density of states
(Figure S14) shows more O 2p states close
to the Fermi level for O2 adsorbed on the defective Fe-substituted
ceria model, which will enhance oxidation of aromatics. Another relevant
aspect is the much higher density of O vacancies in Fe-doped ceria
as compared with the stoichiometric ceria surface, which should also
contribute significantly to the improved soot oxidation performance.

Conclusions
We demonstrate that 3DOM mixed Fe–Ce–Zr
oxides are
suitable for the simultaneous oxidation of soot and selective catalytic
reduction of NOx in SCRPF technology.
NO is reduced by >90%, and soot is completely combusted in the
265–420
°C temperature range. The addition of Fe and Zr to ceria lowers
the temperature of soot combustion to a level that is typically achieved
by more expensive Pt catalysts. The 3DOM texture is suitable for trapping
soot particles, and the presence of Fe in the ceria surface gives
rise to high activity in NOx reduction
and soot oxidation at intermediate temperatures. The importance of
the open macroporous 3DOM texture in soot capture and combustion was
demonstrated by comparison to a mesoporous mixed oxide of the same
composition. Surface characterization and DFT calculations show that
substitution of Fe in the structured mixed Ce–Zr oxide increased
the number of oxygen vacancies. A mechanism is explored for the reduction
of NO with NH3 involving adsorbed O2 as a catalytic
surface intermediate. Such adsorbed O2 species may also
be important in soot oxidation. These structured mixed oxides may
find application in diesel particulate filters, e.g., by inclusion
in wall flow filters constituting ceramic honeycomb structures plugged
to force the exhaust flow through the walls. One may, for instance,
consider integrating mixed oxide developed here with the base corderite
ceramic used in such filters.
