A palladium N-heterocyclic
carbene catalyzed methodology for the
synthesis of substituted, N-unprotected indoles and azaindoles is
reported. The protocol permits access to various, highly substituted
members of these classes of compounds. Although two possible reaction
pathways (deprotonative and Heck-like) can be proposed, control experiments,
supported by computational studies, point toward a deprotonative mechanism
being operative.

Introduction
Heterocyclic architectures comprise the
core of countless biologically
active compounds1 and functional materials.2 The development of methodologies enabling their
synthesis began in the late 19th century3 and remains a field of high activity. Since the report of early
examples by Hegedus,4 Larock,5 and Cacchi,6 palladium
catalysis has provided a number of entries into the synthesis and
functionalization of heterocyclic compounds.7 The Pd-catalyzed α-arylation of carbonyl compounds belongs
to the class of deprotonative cross-coupling processes,8 in which the nucleophile is generated by deprotonation
of acidic compounds, affording the reactive anionic nucleophilic coupling
partner. Discovered concomitantly by Hartwig, Buchwald, and Miura,9 this process has rapidly evolved and can currently
be performed on a wide range of coupling partners in a very efficient
manner.10 The well-known chemistry of carbonyl
compounds makes these protocols particularly suitable for further
functionalization toward complex molecules:11 indeed, during the past decade, the application of the α-arylation
(or vinylation) of carbonyl derivatives has provided a number of protocols
achieving highly substituted heterocyclic moieties such as indole
derivatives,12 benzofurans,13 isoquinolines,14 and
pyridines15 (see Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Selected Synthetic Approaches Leading
to Highly Substituted Heterocycles
by α-Arylation or Vinylation Reactions
Despite their relatively recent development, these approaches
have
already proven useful in the synthesis of medicinal compounds and
natural products,16 as recently demonstrated
by Donohoe and co-workers in the preparation of various members of
the protoberberine class of alkaloids.17 As for most of the cross-coupling protocols reported to date, the
efficiency of the α-arylation of carbonyls (AAC) is profoundly
influenced by the steric and electronic properties of the ancillary
ligand(s) bound to the Pd center:8 bulky,
electron-rich phosphines as well as N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs)
generally provide a state-of-the-art level of reactivity in cross-coupling
processes.18

Although rare examples
of ligand-free protocols exist,19 our recent
work has demonstrated that bulky
yet flexible, “new generation” NHC ligands are ideally
suited for this palladium catalysis, rendering transformations more
facile and less demanding of precious metals.20 Following this initial study, we envisaged the possibility of preparing
unprotected N-indole derivatives by a sequential
ketone arylation/condensation reaction between a ketone and an o-chloroaniline derivative. Such an approach would potentially
give access to a wide variety of indole scaffolds, which is considered
the most widespread heterocyclic motif found in industrially relevant
compounds.21 Disappointingly, the intermolecular
one-pot approach did not afford clean reaction crudes, as competition
between α-arylation and N-arylation at the aniline moiety occurs.22

In order to overcome this problem, we
prepared the imine 1a by condensation of the two coupling
partners (see Figure 1), followed by a
distinct cyclization step. A strategy involving the cyclization of o-haloimines has been previously developed by Lachance and
co-workers,23 although their protocol suffers
many drawbacks (high temperatures, high catalyst loadings, only moderate
yields when chloroarenes are used). Moreover, the reaction conditions
used by this group, namely [Pd(PPh3)4] as catalyst
and an amine base, suggest that a Heck mechanism, rather than ACC,
was active. The present work is therefore aimed at the development
of an intrinsically different, and ideally more efficient, catalytic
method affording indole scaffolds.

Results and Discussion
Selection of the Precatalyst
Our
initial attempts at
the cyclization of 1a were carried out employing the
conditions we previously developed for the intramolecular ketone arylation
using different precatalysts.20 We found
that the bulky IPr* ligand (IPr* = 1,3-bis(2,6-dibenzhydryl-4-methylphenyl)-2-methylene-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-ylidene) gave full conversion to a single product
at 1 mol % catalyst loading. We therefore lowered the catalyst loading
to 0.5 mol % and screened a library of precatalysts, varying the bulkiness
of the ancillary ligand, the throw-away ligand, and the metal (see Scheme 2). Surprisingly,
both IPr- and IHept-based precatalysts (3a,c), which proved active in the α-arylation of ketones,20,24 gave low conversion. Ni-based precatalyst 3f also gave
poor conversions even at relatively high catalyst loading. We found,
however, that the (flexible) bulkiness of the ligand was crucial when
Pd was the metal: precatalysts 3b,d, bearing
IPr* and IPr*OMe ligands, respectively, afforded nearly
quantitative conversions to the desired product 2a even
at 0.5 mol % catalyst loading; various other ligands gave unsatisfactory
conversion (for the complete screening list, see the Supporting Information). Complex 3e, in which
the cinnamyl sacrificial ligand was substituted with the acetylacetonate
moiety, showed slightly inferior results. The role of the very bulky
IPr*-derived ligands clearly appears critical in promoting this reaction
efficiently at low catalyst loading. These results further highlight
the colossal effect that exceedingly bulky, monodentate ligands have
on the catalytic properties of monoligated Pd species.25 Similar performance-enhancing effects have also
been observed under Ni catalysis, both in cross-coupling processes26 and in other transformation types.27 The steric shielding provided by such ligands
has also been used in the study of highly unstable complexes of coinage
metals.28

Optimization
of the Base/Solvent System
Once the commercially
available29 complex 3b was
selected as the optimal precatalyst for this transformation, we performed
a screening of base/solvent combinations (selected results are summarized
in Table 1). These
experiments showed the profound influence of the base counterion,
especially in relation to the solvent employed: when tert-butoxide bases were used, switching from sodium to lithium to potassium
cations completely changed the reactivity. While NaOtBu gave good results in both toluene and dioxane, with no detection
of starting material in the latter case (entries 4 and 5), it gave
lower conversion in DME (entry 6). KOtBu gave high
conversion only in toluene, while it performed very poorly in ethers
(entries 7–9); LiOtBu, in contrast, gave almost
no conversion in toluene but high conversion in ethers, particularly
in DME (entries 1–3). Such an influence of the base counterion
is typically observed in deprotonative couplings, such as the AAC
class of reactions.10b,20,26c The complete base/solvent optimization can be found in the Supporting Information.

c Concentration 0.250 M.

e Catalyst loading 0.1 mol %.

The reactions presented in Table 1, entries 3–5
and 7, were repeated at lower
temperature to identify the best base/solvent system (entry 11). Further
optimization of the reaction time showed that the conversion was complete
after 4 h (entry 15), and an increase in concentration only slightly
lowered the efficiency of this intramolecular process (entry 14).
However, a further decrease of the catalyst loading from 0.5 to 0.1
mol % resulted in a dramatic decrease in conversion (entry 16). The
conditions summarized in entry 15 were therefore adopted for the study
of the scope of the cyclization reaction.

Scope of the Reaction
The protocol proved suitable
for the synthesis of differently substituted indoles (see Scheme 3): the propiophenone-derived
imine 1a was fully converted to the respective 3-methyl-2-phenylindole
and isolated in 91% yield. The acetophenone-derived indole 2b was also obtained in good yield under the same conditions. 3-Pentanone-derived
indole 2c was also obtained at 0.5 mol % catalyst loading
by prolonging the reaction time to overnight, while tricyclic product 2d required higher catalyst loading and 24 h under these reaction
conditions to afford good yields. Substitution with 1- and 2-naphthyl
at the 2-position was well tolerated. It is interesting to notice
the difference in reactivity observed between regioisomers 2e and 2f, which only differ in the position of the indole–naphthalene
bond: the former bears the less sterically crowded 2-naphthalene moiety
and requires longer reaction times in comparison to the bulkier 1-naphthalene
derivative 2f, clearly showing a positive effect of the
steric pressure on the overall catalytic efficiency. This methodology
was also able to afford tetracyclic cores such as 2i.
Basee-sensitive functional groups, such as the nitrile moiety, were
tolerated, although in this case the yield was lower (entry 2j). The presence of a deactivating electron-donating group
on the A ring was also accepted, as exemplified in compound 2k. The protocol was found suitable for scale-up, as illustrated
by a 10 mmol scale (ca. 2 g) synthesis of 2c, affording
slightly improved yield.

Scheme 3 Scope of the Reaction: Synthesis of Indoles
Reaction performed on a 10
mmol scale: 10 mmol of 1c, 1.2 equiv of NaOtBu, 0.5 mol % of 3b, 0.125 M in dioxane, 110 °C,
24 h.

Conditions unless
specified otherwise: 0.25 mmol of 1, 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu, 0.5 mol % or 2.0% of 3b, 0.125 M in dioxane,
110 °C, 4–24 h. Yields are the average of two runs.

Of note, some of the compounds shown in Scheme 3 are industrially
significant: compound 2g is a key intermediate in the
synthesis of antidiabetic
drugs,30 while 2i is an intermediate
in the synthesis of organic electronic materials31 and 2k is used in the synthesis of drugs for
lower urinary tract dysfunction.32

As it does not require drybox technique and relies on a bench-stable,
single-component precatalyst, this protocol is of remarkable practicality,
especially considering the wide variety of o-chloroanilines
and ketones that are commercially available. The results obtained
in the synthesis of indoles encouraged us to extend this methodology
to even more challenging targets, namely 4- and 6-azaindole cores,
which are of great interest in medicinal chemistry (see Scheme 4).32

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Azaindoles
Conditions: 0.25
mmol of 1a, 1.1 equiv of NaOtBu, 0.5
or 2.0 mol %
of 3b, 0.125 M in dioxane, 110 °C, 16–24
h. Yields are the average of two runs.

Four
differently substituted 4-azaindole derivatives were prepared:
compound 5a, bearing the bulky 2-naphthyl substituent
at the 2-position, was obtained in good yield. The propiophenone derivative 5b was obtained in 80% yield with only 0.5 mol % catalyst
loading. Substitution on both starting materials was well tolerated
(5c,e), and the 6-azaindole core was also
accessible by this methodology (entry 5d). Attempts to
expand the scope to 2,3-diphenyl-substituted indoles, as well as the
extension of this methodology to the 5- and 7-azaindole cores, were
unsuccessful: in both cases, the synthesis of the imine could not
be achieved in significant yield.

Mechanistic Study
Computational
Studies
The proposed mechanisms for the
catalytic transformation of 1 into 2 (or 2′) are given in Scheme 5. The following notation is introduced in the scheme:
if the substrate is in the enamine form, the compound or complex is
designated with a prime (′): e.g., 1′. Since coordination of one 1,4-dioxane molecule to [Pd0(NHC)] species was found to be exergonic by 2.7 kcal/mol,
we believe the reaction begins from a complex of [Pd0(NHC)]
with 1,4-dioxane, denoted as 6. The relative free energy
of 6 plus the substrate was taken as 0 kcal/mol. At the
first step of the mechanism, reaction of the organic substrate A with 6 occurs via C–Cl bond scission
and formation of complex 7 and release of dioxane. This
transformation was found to be endergonic by only 1.3 kcal/mol. The
following conversion of 7 to 7′ occurs
with hydrogen migration to the nitrogen atom and simultaneous coordination
of the olefin to the Pd center. This process is exergonic by 13.3
kcal/mol. The direct transformation 6 → 7′ is exergonic by 12 kcal/mol and thus possible if 1 undergoes isomerization to 1′, which
is only 4.3 kcal/mol less stable.

Scheme 5 (1) Possible Reaction Pathways Involved
in This Approach and (2)
Their Representation on the Reaction Coordinates
Starting from species 7′,
there are three different
pathways leding to product 2 (or 2′)
and regeneration of the catalyst. First, we propose a pathway involving
imine deprotonation followed by reductive elimination (path A in Scheme 5). In this mechanism, 7′ reacts with NaOtBu and forms 8′ and NaCl. This step was found to be endergonic by
11.6 kcal/mol. The following transformation of 8′
into 10′ and tBuOH was calculated
to be thermodynamically favorable by 22.6 kcal/mol and occurs via
transition state TSA1. The associated Gibbs free energy
barrier is 21.1 kcal/mol. 10′ can then eliminate 2′, giving back the catalytic species 6. This process is exergonic by almost 40 kcal/mol and is apparently
irreversible. Kinetically this is a very fast conversion, since the
associated transition state (TSA2) is only 4.3 kcal/mol
above 10′. Alternatively, 10′
can isomerize into 10. This process is thermodynamically
favorable by 2.7 kcal/mol. Then, 10 can form the initial
species 1 and eliminate 2 via transition
state TSA3. The process is favorable thermodynamically
by 37.2 kcal/mol, and the associated Gibbs free energy barrier is
only 3.5 kcal/mol. Afterward, 2 converts into 2′, since this process is thermodynamically favorable by 10.8
kcal/mol because of the aromatization of the heterocycle. The rate-limiting
barrier in path A is between TSA1 and 7′
and amounts to 32.7 kcal/mol. Overall the 1 → 2′ conversion is exergonic by 62.9 kcal/mol. In addition,
direct amine deprotonation of 7′ with NaOtBu to form the negatively charged ion 5 with tBuOH and Na+ species was studied (path C). As
expected in 1,4-dioxane solvent, this transformation is thermodynamically
prohibited, being endergonic by 40.8 kcal/mol, and can therefore be
discarded. The second proposed mechanism is a “Heck type”
(carbopalladation followed by hydride elimination, path B) and was
postulated for a similar transformation, which occurs under different
conditions with respect to the precatalyst, the base, and the temperature
used.23 In this mechanism 7′ converts into 11′ via a carbopalladation
transition state (TSB1). Despite the fact that this process
is thermodynamically favorable by 11.9 kcal/mol, it requires 32.2
kcal/mol of activation energy, which makes it the rate-determining
step in path B. Further transformation of 11′
into 12 is exergonic by 16 kcal/mol and occurs with elimination
of 2′. This step is almost barrierless, since
the associated β-hydride elimination transition state (TSB2) was found to be energetically equal to 11′ (in fact even slightly more stable, which is an artifact
of calculations, due to different basis sets for geometry optimizations
and SP energy evaluations). The subsequent reaction of 12 with NaOtBu to form 13 and NaCl was
found to be exergonic by 4.7 kcal/mol. The subsequent transformation
of 13 into the initial catalyst 6 is thermodynamically
favorable by 18.3 kcal/mol and occurs with the release of tBuOH.

On the basis of DFT calculations, the catalytic
conversion of 1 into 2′ can occur
via two highly competitive
mechanisms, paths A and B. Both mechanisms possess an estimated overall
activation barrier of some 33 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement
with the experimental conditions (4 h at 110 °C in 1,4-dioxane).

Further Mechanistic Studies: Ruling out the Heck Pathway
To shed further light on the mechanism, we designed an additional
set of experiments involving the use of triethylamine (TEA) as a base
for this reaction. Our hypothesis relies on the intrinsically different
role of the base in the two mechanistic pathways (A and B) proposed:
in path A, the base is necessary to form the imine enolate by deprotonation
at the α-position, while in path B it acts as a proton sponge,
facilitating the reduction of the Pd(II)–hydride species. In
the former case, the pKa of the base chosen,
as well as its counterion, should play a central role in dictating
the catalytic efficiency; in the latter case, the reactivity should
not significantly be affected by the pKa of the base. This hypothesis is based on typical conditions for
the Heck reaction in comparison to those employed for the AAC.33 The use of TEA would therefore be disadvantageous
if the reaction proceeds through path A, in which the deprotonation
step is rate-determining, while it would not affect the reaction outcome
in path B, as in that case the base is not involved in the rate-limiting
step. The catalytic experiments performed are shown in Scheme 6. The reaction summarized in
eq 1 was performed under the conditions previously applied for the
transformation (see Scheme 3, entry 2a), substituting the tert-butoxide base with TEA, and afforded no detectable product.

Scheme 6 Further Mechanistic Studies
To rule out the possibility that this could be due to
the inability
of such a weak base to promote the activation of the cinnamyl-based
precatalyst,34 we performed a reaction
under the same conditions, adding 10 mol % of NaOtBu. In this case, only 10% conversion was observed (Scheme 6, eq 2). We finally tested
the feasibility of such a reaction under more forcing conditions,
increasing the catalyst loading to 2.0 mol % and the reaction time
to 24 h, obtaining again only 10% conversion (Scheme 6, eq 3). These results point toward an AAC-like
mechanism (path A) rather than a Heck mechanism. To further confirm
these data, additional computational experiments were performed, examining
the thermodynamic feasibility of the catalytic steps involving the
base in both paths A and B.

The reaction depicted in eq 1 of Scheme 7 was found to be
thermodynamically unfavorable
by 4.1 kcal/mol. Clearly, with standard 1 M conditions the reactants
are more preferable than the products. However, this equilibrium can
be shifted to the left by the concentration factor and is therefore
theoretically possible. The second reaction (Scheme 7, eq 2) is thermodynamically forbidden, since
the associated Gibbs free energy change is 16.1 kcal/mol: this equilibrium
cannot be shifted by the concentration factor. Finally, the direct
α-deprotonation show in eq 3 of Scheme 7 cannot take place under the computed conditions,
as the products are immediately converted to the starting materials.
Comparing these computed results with the experiments performed using
TEA as a base (Scheme 6), we can conclude that the Heck-like mechanism, which would be theoretically
active in the presence of a weak base, can be excluded as a viable
reaction route. Therefore, we propose that the reaction proceeds via
a deprotonative mechanism, related to that of the α-arylation
of carbonyls, when [Pd(IPr*)(cinnamyl)Cl] (3b) is used
as a precatalyst.

Paths A and
B
Conclusions
The
present work disclosed an efficient synthesis of N-unprotected
indole derivatives starting from o-chloroarylimines.
This transformation highlights the remarkable effects of the steric
properties of the ligand employed and allows for the synthesis of
a wide variety of functionalized compounds also on a gram scale. This
protocol represents an improvement over existing methods in terms
of reaction temperature, catalyst loading, average yields, and reaction
scope. Other catalytic protocols leading to the synthesis and functionalization
of heterocycles are currently being developed in our laboratories
and will be reported in due course.

Computational Details
Geometry Optimizations
and Calculations of Thermochemical Corrections
All geometry
optimizations were performed using the PBE GGA35 functional as implemented in the PRIRODA 13
DFT code.36 All-electron basis sets (λ1)37 comparable in quality to the correlation consistent
valence double-ζ plus polarization (cc-PVDZ) basis sets of Dunning
were used. All stationary geometries were characterized by an analytically
calculated Hessian matrix. Scalar relativistic effects (for Pd and
Br) were taken into account via the Dyall Hamiltonian.38 The default, adaptively generated PRIRODA grid,
corresponding to an accuracy of the exchange-correlation energy per
atom (1 × 10–8 hartree) was decreased by a
factor of 100 for more accurate evaluation of the exchange-correlation
energy. Default values were used for the self-consistent-field (SCF)
convergence and the maximum gradient for geometry optimization criterion
(1 × 10–4 au), whereas the maximum displacement
geometry convergence criterion was decreased to 0.0018 au. Translational,
rotational, and vibrational partition functions for thermal corrections
to arrive at total Gibbs free energies were computed within the ideal-gas,
rigid-rotor, and harmonic oscillator approximations. The temperature
used in the calculations of thermochemical corrections was set to
298.15 K in all cases.

Single-Ooint (SP) Energy Evaluations
The energies were
re-evaluated at optimized geometries by means of the M0639 functional as implemented in the Gaussian 09
code.40 All-electron def2-tzvpp basis sets
of the Ahlrichs group were used with corresponding density-fitting
basis sets.41 The default value for the
SP SCF convergence was adopted. The “Integral (grid = ultrafine)”
option was used for evaluation of the exchange-correlation term.

Solvent Effects
Electrostatic and nonelectrostatic
solvent effects were estimated by means of the SMD42,43 solvation model as implemented in the Gaussian 09 code. The internal
program values for 1,4-dioxane (dielectric constant etc.) were adopted.

This approach has been successfully used
by Spergel and co-workers, although their protocol has major drawbacks
regarding substrate scope (only electron-poor aniline derivatives)
and efficiency (20% loading of a well-defined Pd-NHC complex was necessary
to reach generally moderate yields):
