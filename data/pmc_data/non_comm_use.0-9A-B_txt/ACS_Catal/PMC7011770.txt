Herein we report
the iron-catalyzed β-C(sp3)-methylation
of primary alcohols using methanol as a C1 building
block. This borrowing hydrogen approach employs a well-defined bench-stable
(cyclopentadienone)iron(0) carbonyl complex as precatalyst (5 mol
%) and enables a diverse selection of substituted 2-arylethanols to
undergo β-C(sp3)-methylation in
good isolated yields (24 examples, 65% average yield).

==== Body
The incorporation of methyl
groups can have a significant impact upon the pharmacological properties
of a molecule.1 Inspection of Njarđarson’s
poster entitled “Top 200 Brand Name Drugs by Prescription in
2016” reveals that a significant proportion contain the C(sp3)–Me motif (Scheme 1A).2 As such,
the development of new synthetic methods for the direct methylation
of C(sp3)–H bonds is an important
area of scientific endeavor.3 Methanol
is an attractive reagent for methylation processes.4 It is an abundant, biodegradable liquid that is less hazardous
relative to commonly employed methylation reagents such as diazomethane,
dimethyl sulfate, and iodomethane.5

Scheme 1 C(sp3)-Me Motif and BH C(sp3)-Methylation
The borrowing hydrogen (BH) approach combines a transfer hydrogenation
process with a concurrent reaction on the in situ generated reactive
intermediate.6 Employing methanol in BH
alkylation represents a challenging process, which is partly due to
the increased energy of dehydrogenation of methanol to form the required
transient reactive formaldehyde intermediate in relation to benzyl
and longer chain n-alkyl alcohols (ΔH (MeOH) = +84 kJ mol–1, cf. ΔH (EtOH) = +68 kJ mol–1).7 Nevertheless, the BH approach has been utilized for the
α-C(sp3)-methylation of ketones
using methanol as the alkylating agent, employing both precious and
earth-abundant metal catalysts (Scheme 1B).8 The use of methanol
in the catalytic upgrading of ethanol and propanol to iso-butanol has been reported at very high temperatures (typically ≥180
°C).9 However, the general β-C(sp3)-methylation of functionalized
alcohols using methanol remains underdeveloped.10 In 2014, Beller and co-workers reported a homogeneous catalytic
system for this challenging process, which required a combination
of two distinct ruthenium complexes, namely, Ru-MACHO and Shvo’s
complex, in addition to pressure release from the reaction vessel
to obtain satisfactory conversion across a modest range of 2-arylethanols.10a,10b Subsequently, others have described the use of iridium nanoclusters10c,10d and Pt/C10e as heterogeneous catalysts.
Importantly, there are no reports to date that employ a homogeneous
or heterogeneous catalyst system based on an earth-abundant first-row
transition metal for this process. As part of our ongoing interest
in the development of homogeneous hydrogen transfer methods,11 herein we report the use of a well-defined bench-stable
(cyclopentadienone)iron(0) carbonyl complex (5 mol %)12 for the operationally simple and efficient catalytic β-C(sp3)-methylation of various primary
alcohols using methanol as the alkylating agent (Scheme 1C).

To commence our studies,
we selected the β-C(sp3)-methylation
of 2-phenylethanol 1 as
a model system (Table 1). After extensive optimization,13 it
was found that a BH system composed of (cyclopentadienone)iron(0)
carbonyl complex 2 (5 mol %),14 Me3NO (10 mol %), and NaOH (2 equiv.) in MeOH ([1] = 0.5 M) at 130 °C for 24 h, enabled the efficient β-C(sp3)-methylation of 1,
giving 3 in 85% NMR yield and 75% isolated yield (entry
1). No alkylation occurred in the absence of iron precatalyst 2 or NaOH (entries 2 and 3). A small decrease in conversion
is observed in the absence of Me3NO (entry 4),15 which indicated that NaOH can also activate
the precatalyst (Hieber’s method).16 Interestingly, from the iron complexes employed in this study, it
was found that (cyclopentadienone)iron carbonyl precatalyst 2, which contains a more electron-rich cyclopentadienone framework,
was uniquely effective for the desired transformation, with the use
of alternative iron precatalysts 4–8 resulting in no observable formation of methylated alcohol 3 (entry 5).17 Employing K2CO3 as base or reducing the quantity of NaOH to
20 mol % resulted in lower conversion to 3 (entries 6
and 7). Furthermore, altering the reaction concentration (entries
8 and 9), reaction temperature (entries 10 and 11), reducing reaction
time (entry 12), or reducing the catalyst loading (entry 13), all
lowered the efficiency of the β-C(sp3)-methylation of 1. Employing ethanol as solvent using
otherwise standard reaction conditions resulted in 80% recovered 1 with no conversion to any identifiable products. However,
when benzyl alcohol was employed as solvent, 38% conversion to the β-C(sp3)-benzylated product was observed.

With optimized reaction conditions
in hand (Table 1, entry
1), the full scope of the iron-catalyzed
BH β-C(sp3)-methylation of alcohols
was explored (Scheme 2).18 Gratifyingly, a diverse selection
of substituted 2-arylethanols underwent efficient β-C(sp3)-methylation, giving the corresponding methylated
products in good to excellent isolated yields (products 3 and 9–30). Within the aryl unit,
4-Me, 3-Me, and 2-Me substitution was tolerated in addition to extended
aromatic systems (2-Np and 1-Np). However, the attenuated yields obtained
for products 11 and 22 (40% and 23%, respectively)
indicated that the increased steric encumbrance provided by aryl substitution
at the 2-position hindered β-C(sp3)-methylation. Electron-donating aryl substituents (4-OMe, 4-OPh
and 4-OBn) were tolerated in addition to an acetal-protected catechol
motif (products 15-18). Interestingly, when
2-(4-aminophenyl)ethan-1-ol was subjected to the optimized reaction
conditions, both β-C(sp3)-methylation
and N-methylation occurred,19 providing 19 in 52% isolated yield. Substrates containing
electron-withdrawing (4-CF3 and 3,5-(CF3)2) aromatic substituents performed particularly well, giving
products 20 and 21 in 80% and 88% isolated
yields, respectively. The high yields obtained using these substrates
may be attributed toward the increased acidity of the in situ generated
aldehyde intermediates. Halogen incorporation within the substrate
was accommodated, with 2-(4-bromophenyl)ethan-1-ol successfully employed
to provide an additional functional handle within product 23 for subsequent elaboration via established cross-coupling methods.
Furthermore, a variety of 2-heteroarylethanols underwent β-C(sp3)-methylation, including alcohols containing pyridyl,
furan, thiophene, and unprotected indole motifs (products 26-30). The β-C(sp3)-methylation
procedure performs well upon scale-up, with the formation of 3 successfully carried out on a 10 mmol scale in 76% isolated
yield (1.02 g of product). Lengthening the carbon chain proved challenging,
with 3-phenylpropan-1-ol being converted to product 31 in only 9% NMR yield. The requirement of a β-aryl group for
high conversion was attributed toward the increased acidity of the
corresponding in situ-generated aldehyde intermediate. Despite examining
a range of alternative reaction conditions 4-OH, 4-NO2,
4-I, and 4-vinyl aryl substitution were not tolerated, producing a
complex mixture of unidentified products in each case (Scheme 2B). 2-Phenoxyethan-1-ol and
decan-1-ol were unreactive, with starting materials returned.

Next, we explored
the β-C(sp3)-methylation of secondary
alcohols. Guided by our success with 2-arylethanol
substrates, the previously optimized reaction conditions (Table 1, entry 1) were employed
using 1-phenylethan-1-ol as substrate, giving an encouraging 11% conversion
to dimethylated product 32.

Unfortunately, despite
reoptimization efforts, this figure could
not be increased, although isolated yields of 28% and 38% were obtained
for products 33 and 34, respectively, which
contain electron-withdrawing aryl substitution. The same trend was
observed for β-C(sp3)-monomethylation
using 1-arylpropan-1-ol substrates. Pleasingly, 30% isolated yield
was obtained for product 35, whereas double β-C(sp3)-methylation of 2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-ol
produced 36 in 42% isolated yield as a 71:29 mixture
of separable diastereoisomers. For the majority of secondary alcohols
examined, 1H NMR analysis of the crude reaction mixtures
revealed the presence of α-C(sp3)-methylated ketones. This observation was particularly evident in
the formation of α-C(sp3)-methylated
cyclic ketones 37 and 38 in 62% and 53%
isolated yields, respectively. As such, the lower conversions observed
for secondary alcohols is likely due to the inability of the iron–hydrogen
complex species to efficiently reduce the ketone functionality.

The proposed mechanism begins with CO decoordination of [Fe] precatalyst 2 by Me3NO to form the active iron complex (Scheme 3).15 However, based upon our observation that catalysis can
proceed in the absence of Me3NO (Table 1, entry 4), precatalyst activation may also
proceed via addition of hydroxide to a CO ligand followed by loss
of CO2 (Hieber’s method) and subsequent loss of
H2 upon reaction with methanol.16 The active iron complex can then abstract hydrogen from 2-phenylethanol 1 and methanol to form the required transient 2-phenylacetaldehyde 39 and formaldehyde intermediates. A subsequent Aldol reaction
generates β-hydroxy aldehyde 40 that undergoes
base-catalyzed dehydration to form enal 41, which may
exist in equilibrium with methyl ether 42. Finally, global
reduction of enal 41 by the iron–hydrogen complex
gives β-C(sp3)-methylated product 3 with regeneration of the active iron complex. To obtain
supporting evidence for the proposed reaction mechanism, the validity
of several plausible reaction intermediates was probed (Scheme 4A). Diol 43, allylic
alcohol 44, and methyl ether 45 could be
formed via hydrogenation of 40, 41, and 42, respectively. Subjecting these compounds to the “standard”
reaction conditions resulted in formation of β-C(sp3)-methylated product 3 in all cases,
which indicated that compounds 40–45 are all plausible reaction intermediates. The conversion profile
over time was studied for the β-C(sp3)-methylation of alcohol 1.13 It was found that product 3 initially formed quickly,
with 44% and 72% conversion to 3 observed after 1 and
2 h, respectively. Beyond 2 h, the conversion to 3 slowed
down and steadily increased to 80% after 24 h. No aldehyde intermediates
were observed, which indicated that they are short-lived and undergo
rapid hydrogenation to the corresponding alcohols. To gain further
mechanistic insight, CD3OD was employed as the solvent
under otherwise standard reaction conditions (Scheme 4B). This introduced a β-CD3 group within alcohol product 46 in addition to significant
deuterium incorporation at the α- and β-positions, which
confirmed methanol as the methylating agent and provided support for
the proposed iron hydride species and the borrowing hydrogen mechanism
(cf. Scheme 3).

In conclusion, we
have developed an operationally simple and efficient
iron-catalyzed β-C(sp3)-methylation
of primary alcohols using methanol as a C1 building block via the
borrowing hydrogen approach. This is the first report that employs
a catalyst system based on an earth-abundant first-row transition
metal for this process. A diverse selection of substituted 2-arylethanols
underwent β-C(sp3)-methylation in
good to excellent isolated yields (24 examples, 65% average yield).
Some encouraging preliminary results were also obtained for the β-C(sp3)-methylation of secondary alcohols,
which will be the subject of further investigation from our laboratory.
