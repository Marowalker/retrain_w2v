Our
contribution demonstrates that rhodium, an element that has
barely been reported as an active metal for selective dehydrogenation
of alkanes becomes a very active, selective, and robust dehydrogenation
catalyst when exposed to propane in the form of single atoms at the
interface of a solid-supported, highly dynamic liquid Ga–Rh
mixture. We demonstrate that the transition to a fully liquid supported
alloy droplet at Ga/Rh ratios above 80, results in a drastic increase
in catalyst activity with high propylene selectivity. The combining
results from catalytic studies, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
IR-spectroscopy under reaction conditions, microscopy, and density-functional
theory calculations, we obtained a comprehensive microscopy picture
of the working principle of the Ga–Rh supported catalytically
active liquid metal solution.

Introduction
Following our general
interest in novel supported liquid catalysts
for high temperature applications, we have very recently proposed
supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) as
a very promising class of heterogeneous catalysts. Published SCALMS
systems are composed of catalytically active liquid alloy droplets
(GaxPdy1,2 or GaxPty3) on a porous support. In contrast to
conventional supported liquid phase catalysis, the catalytic reaction
in SCALMS occurs only at the highly dynamic liquid metal/gas interface,
as the liquid metal does not provide any relevant reactant solubility.
The first account of SCALMS systems in catalysis1 described Ga-rich Ga/Pd mixtures (Ga/Pd ratio > 10)
on
porous glass and revealed high activity and high robustness of these
systems against coking in n-butane dehydrogenation
at 450 °C. The liquid nature of the supported alloy droplet under
the reaction conditions was confirmed through a combination of X-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and ab initio dynamics calculations.

Shortly
after our initial SCALMS work was published, Upham et al.
reported a bulk liquid metallic solution of nickel in bismuth, which
could be used up to temperatures of 1100 °C for methane pyrolysis
to hydrogen and elemental carbon.4 These
authors showed that the activity and stability of the bulk liquid
metallic catalyst were higher than that of its solid counterparts.
While a Ni wire lost 50% of its activity in less than 1 h, the bulk
liquid metallic catalyst could be used up to 1200 h, without any significant
loss of performance. With their findings, these authors confirmed
general statements in earlier works by Ogino, claiming that the intrinsic
dynamics of liquid metal surfaces would help to avoid the loss of
activity in bulk liquid metal catalysis.5 Severe corrosion issues, however, arise when operating bulk liquid
metals and their alloys in contact with metallic reaction equipment,
making this sort of bulk liquid metal catalysis challenging from an
application point of view.6

So far,
only a small number of examples of rhodium-based alkane
dehydrogenation catalysts have been reported. The excellent and very
comprehensive review on alkane dehydrogenation published by Sattler
et al. from 20147 does not contain a single
example of Rh-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysis. Our own targeted
literature survey revealed only two papers dealing with the dehydrogenation
of iso-butane using Rh-based catalysts.8,9 In both papers,
the activity of the Rh systems was reported to be much lower compared
to Pt- or Pd-based catalysts on the same supports.10

In this contribution, we present a new Ga–Rh
SCALMS system
exhibiting highly attractive catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation
(PDH). To the best of our knowledge, no example of Rh-catalyzed dehydrogenation
of propane has been reported. Our contribution focuses on three different
states of the investigated Rh-based catalysts and aims to pinpoint
characteristic differences among them: (i) single phase Rh on alumina
as a baseline comparison of a traditional supported Rh catalyst. (ii)
Alumina-supported Ga–Rh with an atomic Ga/Rh ratio of 25 and
34. According to the Ga–Rh phase diagram,11 these compositions lead to the formation of a mixture of
solid intermetallic Ga–Rh compounds (e.g., Ga16Rh3) and a liquid Rh–Ga-rich alloy at the highest reaction
temperatures tested (550 °C). (iii) Alumina-supported Ga–Rh
with an atomic Ga/Rh ratio above 80. These highly diluted compositions
result in supported, fully liquid droplets of the Ga–Rh alloy
at a temperature of 550 °C.11

We demonstrate that the addition of Ga to the alumina-supported
Rh catalyst leads to an enhanced catalytic performance. Interestingly,
a strong additional boost in Rh-based activity can be found at the
transition to the fully liquid Rh–Ga system. We performed XPS,
IR-spectroscopy, and microscopy studies in combination with density-functional
calculations to reveal how catalysis at the liquid interface of Rh–Ga
SCALMS systems proceeds at the microscopic level.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Ga–Rh-SCALMS Materials
The Ga–Rh
SCALMS materials were prepared using the procedure recently described
for Ga/Pd systems.1 Analogously, the deposition
of Rh was achieved by partial galvanic replacement of Ga. Briefly,
aqueous suspensions of the metallic Ga/AlOx material were mixed with different amounts of stock solution of
RhCl3·3H2O, in order to obtain the materials
with the intended different Rh–Ga ratios. After filtration,
the products were dried at 130 °C and used in the catalytic experiment
without any further treatment (for details see Supporting Information).

PDH Experiments
The PDH experiments were carried out
in a tubular quartz reactor. The reactor was heated to the desired
reaction temperature under a flow of an inert gas. When the reaction
temperature was reached, a flow of propane was added to the He flow,
resulting in a catalyst bed contact time of 0.7 s and a gas hour space
velocity (GHSV) of 4900 h–1. The effluent gas flow
was analyzed with an online-GC (see Supporting Information for details).

Figure 1 shows the comparison of Rh on alumina with
the Ga–Rh alloys of different compositions (as prepared in
this work) at 550 °C. Rh on alumina displays under these conditions
an initial productivity of 15 gpropylene gRh–1 h–1 that remains stable over
15 h time-on-stream. The conversion with the Rh/AlOx catalyst is around 4% with propylene selectivity rising from
an initial 78% level to close to 90% after 15 h time-on-stream. Note,
that the empty reactor shows a conversion of around 0.3% with a propylene
selectivity of 35% at 550 °C (propane flow: 8.9 mL min–1, He flow: 89 mL min–1, see Supporting Information for further details).

Figure 1 Conversion (top) and
Rh-based productivity (bottom) of different
Ga–Rh-SCALMS in PDH at 550 °C and 1.2 bar. Molar ratios
of Ga–Rh are 0 (open circles), 34 (downward-pointing triangles),
89 (upward-pointing triangles), and 125 (diamonds). Reaction conditions:
1.2 g catalyst (Rh/Al2O3: 0.19 wt % Rh; Ga34Rh: 0.26% Rh, 5.90% Ga; Ga82Rh: 0.11% Rh, 5.9%
Ga; Ga125Rh: 0.07% Rh, 5.94% Ga), He flow 89 mLN min–1, C3H8 flow 8.9 mLN min–1, GHSV 4900 h–1.

As the baseline experiment, we also evaluated the
catalytic activity
of Ga on AlOx at 550 °C in PDH. It
was found that the initial conversion was 4% with a propylene selectivity
of around 95%. Note, that gallium oxide has recently been described
as an active catalyst for PDH.12,13 We cannot exclude that
some amount of gallium oxide is present in the precious metal-free,
Ga on the AlOx material in the form of
a passivation layer of the Ga droplets adsorbed on the support, and
that this amount caused the observed catalytic activity. However,
it is known from the literature that in the presence of noble metals
under the reductive conditions of PDH experiments, gallium oxide species
are reduced to elemental Ga.14,15 Indeed, we find clear
evidence from our XPS and IR spectroscopy experiments that gallium
oxide species are reduced to elemental Ga in the presence of Rh (see
below and Supporting Information). All
Ga–Rh alloys under investigation showed significantly higher
initial conversions, with ∼20% (Ga34Rh), and ∼29%
(Ga125Rh).

Comparing the catalytic performance of
the Ga–Rh alloys
with maximum and minimum compositions ratios (125 vs 34) at 550 °C,
a remarkable difference in productivity is observed.

This change
in alloy composition resulted in a productivity increase
by a factor of 4–5. The maximum initial activities were 263
gpropylene gRh–1 h–1 versus 49 gpropylene gRh–1 h–1, for Ga125Rh and Ga34Rh, respectively, and the productivities after 15 h time-on-stream
were 127 gpropylene gRh–1 h–1 versus 31 gpropylene gRh–1 h–1, respectively. Selectivities
were very similar in all experiments with Ga–Rh alloys: typically
around 92% for conversions between 10 and 20% (see Supporting Information for details). All SCALMS material showed
slight deactivation over time. No apparent changes in the catalyst
morphology could be seen by means of SEM imaging, for example droplet
coalescence with consequent loss of the active surface (see Supporting Information, Figure S3). However,
deactivation due to morphological changes cannot be completely excluded.
On the other hand, the observed deactivation could be attributed to
the formation of coke under reaction conditions, that is, at 550 °C.
Indeed, XPS of spent catalysts showed an increase of the C 1s component
in all samples when compared to the as-prepared materials (see Supporting Information, Figure S11). In addition,
the presence of coke in SCALMS after PDH was confirmed using Raman
spectroscopy (see Supporting Information, Figure S10). However, the moderate fluorescence of Al2O3 due to the applied laser wavelength prohibited the
clear identification of coke in spent SCALMS after PDH at a temperature
≤ 500 °C, suggesting a minor formation of carbon on these
catalysts under these milder conditions. Remarkably and in strong
contrast to the tested SCALMS, the formation of coke was clearly observable
for the Ga-free Rh catalyst after PDH, already at the lowest temperature
tested of 450 °C (i.e., indicating the deposition of a sufficient
amount of coke to quench the fluorescence of Al2O3). In other words, although the formation of coke could not be completely
suppressed, the SCALMS materials displayed an increased resistance
against coking compared to the pure Rh catalyst used as the benchmark.
In fact, the formation of a detectable amount of carbon on SCALMS
could be only observed under the most severe conditions applied, that
is, running the PDH at 550 °C. Accordingly, we suggest that the
observed conversion with the Ga-free Rh catalyst is just the residual
activity after substantial coking deactivation. While the SCALMS systems,
conversely, show strongly enhanced performance over a long time on
stream operations, as the poisoning by coke formation is significantly
reduced (Figure 1).

XPS Investigations
The XPS measurements of the supported
alloy samples, before and after catalytic operation, clearly indicate
the formation of metallic Ga and Rh species [Ga, Rh, or intermetallic
compounds (IMCs)] during the reaction (see Supporting Information for details). Moreover, to understand the surface
behavior/composition of Rh–Ga alloy droplets, we also studied
model alloy samples with compositions comparable to those screened
in the catalytic tests, as a function of temperature under ultrahigh
vacuum conditions.

In Figure 2, the temperature-dependent composition, as obtained
from the quantitative analysis of the XP spectra, is shown for the
three different mixtures Ga166Rh, Ga82Rh, and
Ga49Rh (0.6, 1.2, and 2.0 at. % Rh in Ga); for exemplary
XP spectra collected from a sample of composition Ga82Rh
see the Supporting Information, Figure
S13.

Figure 2 Rh atomic fraction from quantitative XPS as a function of the sample
temperature. Three curves are shown for the Ga166Rh, Ga82Rh, and Ga49Rh samples (0.6, 1.2, and 2.0 at.
% Rh in Ga).

The measured composition is representative
for the composition
of the liquid phase because of the rather high information depth in
lab-based XPS (93 Å for Ga 3d, 77 Å for Rh 3d in Ga). The
temperature-dependent change of Rh intensity is ascribed to the formation
or melting of Rh-rich IMC, which form in the bulk of the Ga–Rh
droplet or at the droplet interface with alumina (see also microscopy
results below) at lower temperatures. These solid IMC phases, present
in the bulk of the liquid have macroscopic dimensions and are not
probed by the surface-sensitive XPS measurement of the droplet. A
similar behavior and analysis was recently reported for the Ga–Pd
system at low Pd concentrations.1,16 For compositions of
Ga166Rh and Ga82Rh (0.6 and 1.2 at. % Rh in
Ga), the respective plateaus at 480 and 530 °C indicate that
the liquidus temperature (where all IMC are dissolved, and the XPS
data thus give the nominal bulk concentration) is reached, see Figure 2. Below the liquidus
temperature, the composition of the liquid phase is given by the concentration
on the liquidus line. Here, we observe a qualitative agreement with
the bulk phase diagram of Rh–Ga, and the bulk phase diagrams
of comparable systems (Pt–Ga, Pd–Ga). For Ga49Rh, the measurement at the highest temperature also reached the nominal
bulk composition.

Microscopic Investigations
To further
elucidate the
structure, composition, and phase stability of the Ga–Rh systems
under investigation, microscopy investigations on Ga–Rh model
nanoalloys were carried out with transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), either static at room temperature (RT) or in situ during heating
using a furnace TEM holder. Together with the XPS analysis, these
investigations are particularly valuable as the phase diagram of the
Ga–Rh system is not safely established in the low Rh concentration
range.11,17 Moreover, phase stability and melting points
may be altered for bimetallic nanoparticles by nanoscale effects.18 TEM studies were performed on a series of model
GaxRh1 nanoalloys (with x = 16–160, i.e., Rh 0.6–6 at. %) supported
on thin SiO2 membranes. Details on the preparation of the
alloy nanoparticles by physical vapor deposition are provided in the Supporting Information.

We first describe
the structural properties at RT. A typical two-phase structure of
crystalline (c-) precipitates in amorphous (a-) nanoparticles is found
throughout all samples, and exemplary results from the sample with x = 36 (Rh = 2.7 at. %) are summarized in Figure 3a–c. By combining EDXS
mapping, quantification, and careful analysis of the sharp diffraction
rings in electron diffraction patterns, the crystal phase is identified
as Ga16Rh3 or Ga21Rh4 and
their derivatives (see Supporting Information for details). The crystallites possess a laminate shape and show
a preferential orientation, which is likely due to the presence of
the SiO2 membrane below. Stacking disorder can often be
seen in the laminates (cf. Figure 3c white arrows). The Ga-rich particle matrix shows
an amorphous contrast in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, which
agrees with the broad diffuse rings in the electron diffraction patterns
(see Supporting Information, Figure S15).
With increasing Rh concentration from 0 to 6 at. % a systematic evolution
of the particle size and shape toward a larger size with a more irregular
shape is found (see Supporting Information, Figure S16).

on the thin SiO2 membrane. The particles contain crystalline
precipitates as revealed by dark diffraction contrast. (b) Composed
Ga and Rh map extracted from a scanning TEM–EDX dataset confirming

areas showing precipitates. (c) HRTEM image of a single Ga–Rh
particle, the dashed circles indicate the crystalline Ga–Rh
phase. Key frames of electron diffraction patterns taken during an
in situ heating experiment from the samples with (d) x = 36 (Rh = 2.7 at. %) and (e) x = 36 (Rh = 2.7
at. %). Temperatures are indicated at the top-right corner of each
pattern. See the text for details, complete time series (movie) of
in situ SAED are provided in Supporting Information.

From the sparse literature on
Ga–Rh systems, the (equilibrium)
melting temperature at the low Rh concentrations studied in the present
work is expected to be in the range of 200–600 °C.11 To elaborate the phase stability of the c-GaxRhy/a-Ga–Rh
nanoparticles, electron diffraction has been performed in situ while
heating the samples in the TEM. Figure 3d,e show key frames from a series of in situ electron
diffraction patterns taken from the samples with x = 36 (Rh = 2.7 at. %) and x = 105 (Rh = 0.9 at.
%), respectively. In the sample with x = 36, many
sharp diffraction rings (exemplarily marked by black arrows in the
respective patterns) from nanoscale c-GaxRhy can be clearly seen from RT (Figure 3d, left) up to 480
± 10 °C. These sharp rings fade out at a temperature of
500 ± 10 °C and are completely absent at 530 ± 10 °C
(Figure 3d, center).
Upon slow cooling down to RT (over a period of about 3 min), the sharp
crystalline ring gradually reappeared resulting in a pattern at RT
which matches well to that before heating. After cooling down to RT,
the microstructure and Ga to Rh ratio returned to almost the same
value as before heating (Figure 3d, rightmost and Supporting Information), indicating negligible sublimation of Ga and/or Rh in the vacuum
environment of the TEM. In the sample with x = 105,
the sharp crystal rings are much less pronounced as expected from
the lower amount of the crystalline phase. In a few cycles of heating/cooling
experiments, the crystal rings disappeared/appeared at temperatures
between 300 and 420 °C. We state here that the disappearing/appearing
of sharp diffraction rings is not necessarily associated with a solid–liquid
phase transformation. A detailed analysis of two broad diffraction
rings that can in addition be seen at positions q = 2.6 and 4.2 nm–1 is given in Supporting Information.

Density-Functional Calculations
Elucidating the Mode of Action
of the Ga–Rh SCALMS Systems in PDH
To gain further
insight into the nature of the catalytic phase, its surface composition
and the active site for the catalytic transformation, we carried out
ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations based on density-functional
theory (DFT) with periodic boundary conditions. An estimation of the
uncertainty of the AIMD simulations can be found in Supporting Information.

In detail, we studied the composition
of the surface using a slab model with a tetragonal simulation box
containing 180 atoms with a Ga–Rh ratio of 89 (178 Ga, 2 Rh
atoms) and Rh initially located at the surface (one Rh at each side
of the slab). The time evolution of the z-position
of Rh atoms in the slab is shown in Figure 4a (green curve). It is obvious that already
after a few picoseconds Rh disappears from the surface. This is in
line with a simulation with the Ga–Rh ratio of nine (162 Ga,
18 Rh atoms) that shows a Rh surface depletion (see Supporting Information, Figure S21). However, in order to
be catalytically active, the rare Rh surface atoms have to stay at
the surface if a reactant or reaction intermediate is adsorbed on
them. To probe this, we ran AIMD simulations starting with Rh plus
an attached adsorbate located at the surface. For all tested adsorbates,
namely, one or two CO molecules (Figure 4), a propyl residue with one additional hydrogen
atom, propylene, and a hydrogen molecule (see Supporting Information, Figure S22) the adsorbed species can
retain Rh at the surface until it desorbs. After desorption of the
adsorbed species, the Rh atoms immediately diffuse away from the surface.
As will be shown later, DFT calculations suggest that at the end of
the dehydrogenation, propylene is adsorbed to Ga atoms, whereas H2 is bound to the catalytically active Rh atom. Once H2 is desorbed, Rh immediately moves from the surface into the
Ga matrix. The fact that adsorbates can hold dynamically appearing
Rh atoms at the surface may lead to a certain enrichment of catalytically
active centers during catalysis.

Figure 4 Results from DFT calculations. (a) z-position
(perpendicular to the surface) of Rh atoms in the liquid slab model
(see main text and Supporting Information) as function of time. The Rh atoms were initially located at the
two surfaces of the slab, one at the top and one at the bottom surface.
The green lines correspond to a simulation without any adsorbate attached
to the Rh atoms at the surface. The red and the blue lines correspond
to a starting configuration for the simulations, where one and two
CO molecules are adsorbed at each of the Rh atoms at the surface.
On the right the Ga-density along the z-direction
of the slab is shown for orientation. Horizontal lines indicate the
first maximum of the Ga-density for the two surfaces. (b) Simulated
vibrational power spectra for Rh(CO)2 (upper part) and
RhCO (lower part); snapshots of one corresponding geometry from the
MD simulations are additionally depicted. (c) Reaction diagram for
the dehydrogenation of propane on fcc-Ga(100) with one Rh ad-atom.
Ga is depicted in blue, Rh in light red, C in black, and H in white.
Reaction intermediates are indicated by blue lines and transition
states by red lines.

To further elucidate
the mechanism of PDH with our Ga–Rh
SCALMS catalyst, we constructed a solid model system consisting of
a face-centered cubic (fcc)-Ga(100) surface with one Rh atom located
in a slightly distorted fourfold surface hollow site to represent
the isolated catalytically active center. We choose this system for
two reasons: (1) the partial radial distribution function between
Rh and Ga was calculated from the MD simulation for the slab model
used in the MD simulations as described before. Here, the maximum
of the peak corresponding to the first coordination sphere of Rh is
located at a distance of 2.54 Å away from Rh. In comparison with
this, the Rh adatom in the distorted hollow-site of the fcc-Ga(100)
is on average 2.50 Å away from its neighboring Ga atoms. (2)
In addition, we calculated Bader charges for the liquid system used
in the MD as well as the solid model system with the result that Rh
in both cases is negatively charged (−0.83 e as average in
the MD simulation, −0.82 e in the solid model). DFT geometry
optimizations were performed in combination with the climbing image-nudged
elastic band (cNEB) approach and the dimer method19,20 to determine reaction barriers between possible reaction intermediates
(see Supporting Information for details).
Additionally, we carried out calculations for free energies and barriers.
The corresponding reaction profile is shown in the Supporting Information and agrees very well with the energies
and barriers without free energy corrections. The corresponding reaction
diagram for some potential pathways is shown in Figure 4c. Note that this is the first step to get
insight into the basic reaction mechanism of the dehydrogenation at
the atomic level using a specific slab model in conjunction with the
cNEB technique to determine the transition-state energies. Further
details of the reaction mechanism could be obtained in future work
for example by advanced, computationally very demanding MD methods.
In the initial step, the first C–H bond of the weakly bound
propane (Figure 4c
(a), Eads ≈ 0.46 eV) breaks with
an activation barrier of 1.42 eV leaving both H and the residual 2-propyl
species bound to the surface Rh atom (b). The subsequent diffusion
of hydrogen to an adjacent Ga atom (c) is calculated to have a larger
energy barrier (0.66 eV) than the diffusion of the 2-propyl residue
(d, 0.32 eV) because of the large affinity of hydrogen to Rh. The
resulting geometry (d) is 0.76 eV more stable than the structure (c).
To complete the dehydrogenation starting from (d), a rotation of 2-propyl
is required such that a hydrogen of the terminal carbon atom is in
proximity to Rh, with subsequent C–H bond breaking. The activation
barrier for this process is calculated to be 1.31 eV, leading to geometry
(h). In addition, we investigated the second C–H bond breaking
starting from the less stable structure (c), which follows a similar
pathway to the first C–H dissociation; first, the C–H
bond breaks with an activation barrier of 0.54 eV with both, hydrogen
and propylene bound to Rh (e). Thereafter, the diffusion of propylene
to the adjacent Ga (g) requires a lower activation energy (0.29 eV)
than hydrogen diffusion (f) (0.52 eV). Considering the final geometries,
it is obvious that the more hydrogen is bound to Rh, the more energetically
favorable is the structure. This suggests (i) that at the end of the
dehydrogenation reaction, propylene is bound to Ga atoms and can diffuse
away from the active Rh and desorb in the gas phase, while the resulting
two H atoms bound to Rh recombine and desorb as H2. From
our mechanistic study, we conclude that the reaction proceeds as follows:
in the first step, propane that comes from the gas phase with high
kinetic energy hits the reactive Rh center at the surface and uses
its kinetic energy for the first dehydrogenation step. The other reaction
steps require smaller barriers, which can easily be overcome at elevated
temperatures. At the end of the reaction, propene diffuses onto the
Ga matrix and can desorb. Hydrogen at the Rh center can recombine
and desorb as H2. After the H2 desorption, our
AIMD simulations show that the Rh atom immediately moves away into
the Ga matrix. To further investigate the origin of the catalytic
activity of SCALMS, we calculated Bader charges for the liquid SCALMS
model as well as the Rh(111) surface to compare the Rh species in
the Ga environment with metallic Rh of the Rh(111) surface. We found
that the Rh in the liquid Ga slab has an average charge of −0.83
e in the MD simulation, while in the Rh(111), the surface Rh atoms
are obviously metallic Rh0 species. We conclude that Ga
plays the role of an electron donor for the more electronegative Rh.
The negatively charged Rh species, in contrast to Rh0,
is a strongly active dehydrogenation catalyst. This also is one explanation
why the Rh/AlOx catalyst shows a significantly
lower conversion than SCALMS catalysts. Furthermore, this emphasizes
the important role of the Ga matrix for the catalytic process.

Besides this, Ga also modifies the adsorption properties of the
reactants. One of the main issues in dehydrogenation catalysis, for
example for industrially used Pt/AlOx catalysts,
is coking of the surface because the desired products like propene
bind to the active sites too strongly and therefore desorption is
hindered and further dehydrogenation or cracking reactions can occur,
which lead to undesired side products and coking of the surface. This
can be prevented by lowering the adsorption strength of the desired
products, which in this case is achieved by the Ga matrix around the
catalytically active center. Our calculated mechanism also shows that
it is thermodynamically more stable for propene to diffuse away from
the reactive Rh center to the Ga matrix, while hydrogen stays at Rh.
Propene can then easily diffuse away from the Ga matrix. Again, this
underlines the importance of the Ga matrix in the SCALMS system.

Infrared Spectroscopy
Finally, we performed in situ
infrared spectroscopy to gain further information on the state of
Rh in the catalytically active SCALMS. We probed the noble metal sites
at the Ga–Rh interface with adsorbed CO and investigated Ga–Rh
alloys of various compositions (Ga25Rh, Ga88Rh, and Ga125Rh on Al2O3), monometallic
Ga/Al2O3, and Rh/Al2O3 as a reference. Both experiments and DFT calculations showed that
elemental Ga is inactive toward CO adsorption,21−24 while experimental data showed
the presence of hydrides.25 Rh, in contrast,
shows rich carbonyl chemistry, especially when supported on oxides.
The two main features observed on such systems are CO bound to metallic
Rh in an on-top fashion (Rh0CO)26−28 and the atomically
dispersed dicarbonyl RhI(CO)2 formed via the
oxidative disruption of metallic Rh particles.26,29−32 Most bands on the Rh and Rh–Ga samples can be assigned based
on previous studies (see assignments summarized in Table 1).

Here, we limit the discussion to
samples with low Rh loading. Figure 5 shows the DRIFT
spectra obtained from Ga88Rh1/Al2O3 and monometallic Ga–Rh samples. The spectra
acquired from Ga25Rh1/Al2O3 and Ga125Rh1/Al2O3 are
provided in the Supporting Information (Figure
S26) together with a detailed discussion of all DRIFT experiments.

region of the DRIFT spectra obtained from G88Rh/Al2O3 and monometallic Ga–Rh samples
in an Ar atmosphere after treatment with CO. The temperature in °C
and the scaling factors are indicated on the left and right side of
each panel, respectively. All spectra were normalized and displayed
as difference spectra as described in the Supporting Information.

For the Ga88–Rh1/Al2O3 sample, the bands
at 2024 and 1993 cm–1 obtained at 450 °C are
of particular interest. We applied AIMD
slab calculations (see Supporting Information and Figure 4b) to
elucidate the nature of these absorptions. Both RhCO and Rh(CO)2 remain stable at the surface during the complete simulation
(up to 45 ps). Additionally, vibrational power spectra (Figure 4b) were calculated. We found
that the calculated spectra are in excellent agreement with the experimental
spectrum for the Ga88–Rh1 sample above
300 °C. They show a feature at 1993 cm–1 for
RhCO and two bands at 2002 and 1978 cm–1 for the
symmetric and asymmetric CO-stretching frequencies of Rh(CO)2, respectively. Based on this data, we identify two possible explanations
for the experimental observations. On the one hand, the signal at
2024 cm–1 may be assigned to hydrides bound on metallic
Ga (Ga–H peak found at 2021 cm–1 in the case
of the monometallic Ga/Al2O3 sample, compare
also Table 1), while
the peak at 1993 cm–1 originates from a CO stretching
vibration of a RhCO species. On the other hand, the DFT results also
are in agreement with the formation of a Rh(CO)2 species.
In the latter case, the two experimental peaks would be ascribed to
the symmetric and asymmetric CO-stretching modes. From the experimental
and theoretical data, both interpretations appear reasonable, as the
peak positions of RhI(CO)2 (symmetric CO stretch)
and Ga–H bands both lie around 2025 cm–1 and
the features may overlap.

The effect of site isolation on the
CO-stretching frequency is
evaluated by performing frequency calculations in harmonic approximation
for CO at a Rh top-site on a perfect Rh(111) surface at different
coverages. The results as shown in Table 1 are in line with previously calculated values,32,33 which show that the frequency is strongly coverage dependent. Compared
to the experimental data, the DFT values are in excellent agreement
at a high coverage, while being ∼20 cm–1 too
low at lower coverage.34 Therefore, we
conclude that the main contribution to the redshift in the vibrational
spectra of the Rh–Ga mixtures originates from the isolation
of the Rh atoms.

The spectra obtained from the Ga88–Rh1 and Ga125–Rh1 (see Supporting Information, Figure S26)
samples recorded at 400
and 450 °C show only two peaks, which are assigned to Ga–H
species and/or Rh(CO)1–2 in liquid Ga. There is
no evidence for adsorbed CO on Rh atoms interacting with the support
or for the formation of larger Rh clusters. Thus, the thermal evolution
of the DRIFT spectra provides further evidence for the presence of
a liquid Ga phase with isolated Rh atoms exposed at the surface. Figure 6 illustrates our
conclusions from infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculation for the
different Ga–Rh samples under investigation.

Discussion
Merging
the information given for the phase
behavior of the Ga–Rh system,11 the
solubility data of Rh in Ga,35 the analytical
data and additional catalytic experiments described here (see Supporting Information for details), it is possible
to correlate the physical states of the different materials at varying
Ga/Rh ratios with their catalytic properties. In Figure 7, the productivity values obtained
when applying different compositions of SCALMS at different temperatures
are depicted versus the known phase diagram data and the data from
our XPS experiments. According to our XPS and TEM data, systems with
a Ga–Rh ≤ 33 are characterized by the presence of solid
intermetallic Rh–Ga phases, together with a Ga-rich liquid
phase (vide infra) and can be expected to never reach a fully liquid
state, at any of the temperatures tested. Conversely, the system with
Ga–Rh > 120 is expected to be always present in the fully
liquid
phase under the applied reaction conditions forming a liquid alloy.
The systems with 82 < Ga–Rh ≤ 89 may be defined as
borderline cases as the liquidus line is crossed at a temperature
between 450 and 500 °C. Hence, these systems are expected to
be fully liquid at 550 °C. Figure 7 shows that the productivities are always significantly
higher in the case of fully liquid Ga–Rh SCALMS systems, irrespective
of the applied reaction temperature (compare results at 480, 500,
and 550 °C). In other words, the catalyst with Ga125Rh showed the highest performance for the whole set of temperatures,
as its fully liquid nature allows for the maximum presence of single
Rh atoms at the liquid/gas interface (vide infra). The catalysts with
Ga–Rh ≤ 33.5, conversely, showed for all temperatures
the poorest performance, as a significant part of the Rh is always
present in solid intermetallic phases, showing lower catalytic activity
in these systems.

Conclusions
While hardly any successful example of Rh-catalyzed
alkane dehydrogenation
catalysis is known, we show in this paper that supported Ga–Rh
alloys are a very interesting class of PDH catalysts. Even small additions
of Ga to alumina-supported Rh have a positive effect on the catalytic
activity and selectivity. A strong boost of the Rh-induced dehydrogenation
activity was found under conditions where the supported Ga–Rh
alloy is entirely liquid.

Moreover, our paper sheds light on
the chemical nature and working
principles of Rh-based dehydrogenation catalysis in supported Ga–Rh
alloys. From our AIMD simulations, we conclude that the liquid metal
interface is highly dynamic whereby Rh appears at the interface only
periodically and is trapped there for a longer time if propane is
offered from the gas phase. Additionally, our calculations suggest
a cooperative mode of action between Ga and Rh during catalysis with
the activation of the propane at the Rh single-site atom, followed
by transfer of the propyl rest to the Ga surface while recombination
of two hydrides to H2 occurs at the Rh single site. Our
infrared studies confirm the single atom nature of Rh at the liquid
interface.

All our results provide additional evidence that
the specific nature
of supported liquid Ga alloys offers very beneficial properties for
dehydrogenation catalysis. This remarkable fact encourages us to extend
this particular material strategy to explore other Ga alloy systems
and substrates in our ongoing work.
