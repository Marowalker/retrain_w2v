The
promiscuous regio- and stereoselective hydration of 4-hydroxystyrenes
catalyzed by ferulic acid decarboxylase from Enterobacter sp. (FDC_Es) depends on bicarbonate bound in the
active site, which serves as a proton relay activating a water molecule
for nucleophilic attack on a quinone methide electrophile. This “cofactor”
is crucial for achieving improved conversions and high stereoselectivities
for (S)-configured benzylic alcohol products. Similar
effects were observed with simple aliphatic carboxylic acids as additives.
A rational redesign of the active site by replacing the bicarbonate
or acetate “cofactor” with a newly introduced side-chain
carboxylate from an adjacent amino acid yielded mutants that efficiently
acted as C=C hydratases. A single-point mutation of valine
46 to glutamate or aspartate improved the hydration activity by 40%
and boosted the stereoselectivity 39-fold in the absence of bicarbonate
or acetate.

==== Body
The ability
of an enzyme to
catalyze a reaction other than its annotated “natural”
activity is known as catalytic promiscuity1−3 and is the result
of evolutionary processes upon the encounter of “non-natural”
substrates and the organism’s striving for survival.4−6 This phenomenon is an important criterion when selecting enzymes
for the development of biocatalysts for the selective transformation
of synthetic compounds, using rationally guided or randomly based
directed evolution protocols.7 Coumaric
acids and their derivatives constitute monomeric units of lignin in
plant cell walls8 and are a major waste
product of palm oil manufacturing.9,10 In nature,
their degradation is achieved by ferulic and phenolic acid decarboxylases
(FDCs and PADs, respectively). These enzymes cleave their substrates
into CO2 and their respective 4-hydroxystyrenes [1 (Scheme 1a)], which constitute undesired off-flavor components in beer and
wine11 but have also found application
as renewable building blocks for polymers with interesting dielectric
properties.12−14 By supplying an excess of CO2 in the form
of bicarbonate, researchers can perform the process as the reverse
β-carboxylation for the production of substituted coumaric acid
derivatives (Scheme 1a).15−17 During studies of regioselective carboxylation, the
promiscuous hydration of 4-hydroxystyrene derivatives by FDCs and
PADs in the presence of bicarbonate was discovered (Scheme 1b), and the best results were
obtained with a ferulic acid decarboxylase from Enterobacter sp. (FDC_Es).18 The
nucleophile scope apart from water was extended to methoxyamine, cyanide,
and propanethiol, which are added via an analogous mechanism to furnish
(S)-configured benzylic amines, nitriles, and thioethers,
however without the need for bicarbonate (Scheme 1b).19

Scheme 1 (a) Reversible
(De)carboxylation of Coumaric Acids and (b) Promiscuous
Nucleophile Addition to 4-Hydroxystyrenes Catalyzed by Phenolic and
Ferulic Acid Decarboxylases
The biocatalytic hydration of 4-hydroxystyrenes allows
easy access
to the (S)-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol structural
motif (2) from renewable resources in a stereoselective
fashion without the need for protecting groups. The product hydrate
is a substructure of bioactive molecules exerting herbicidal,20 insecticidal,21,22 antiproliferative,23 and (hepatitis C) protease inhibition activities.24,25 Though little is known about the active enantiomeric forms of these
congeners, an improvement in biocatalytic styrene hydration would
be of practical interest to facilitate the exploitation of the benzylic
alcohols as chiral building blocks.

Experimental data18 and quantum mechanical
calculations26 suggest that the promiscuous
hydration of 4-hydroxystyrene requires a bicarbonate anion as a “cofactor”,
which is bound to Arg49 in the active site of the decarboxylase to
achieve good conversion and a high enantiomeric excess (ee) of the
benzylic alcohol product, (S)-2 (Scheme 2). Potassium bicarbonate
(0.5 M, pH 8.5) promotes the hydration of 4-vinylphenol (1) with ∼65% conversion and ∼80% ee using FDC_Es as a biocatalyst.18 In the
absence of bicarbonate, however, a water molecule occupies its position,
resulting in (almost complete) loss of stereoselectivity.26 Consequently, supplementation of bicarbonate
(>0.5 M) is required to maintain stereoselectivity, which renders
this process economically and operationally less attractive.

Scheme 2 Mechanism
of the FDC_Es-Catalyzed Hydration of 4-Hydroxystyrene
with Bicarbonate Acting as a “Cofactor” for Proton Transfer
In initial studies, the compensability
of bicarbonate as a “cofactor”
was investigated by replacing it with different (anionic) additives
(Figure 1). Potassium
phosphate buffer (50 mM) was used as a reaction buffer, and the pH
was adjusted to 8.0 after dissolving the additive salts to avoid bicarbonate
decomposition (pKaH = 7.7) and to allow
for direct comparison of additive effects. Control reactions in neat
phosphate buffer gave moderate conversion (∼60%) but completely
lacked stereoselectivity. Addition of Cl–, HPO42–, or SO42– improved the conversion slighty, while imidazole had adverse effects,
again without stereoinduction. Borate gave a low ee (15%), while the
conversion and ee were significantly improved by bicarbonate. Remarkably,
the best values for conversion and ee were obtained in the presence
of acetate. Next, the concentration of bicarbonate and acetate was
varied within a range of 10–500 mM (Figure S3). While the conversion profiles for both ions showed a similar
behavior at increasing ion concentrations (leveling off at ∼90–95%
conversion and 250 and 300 mM), the product ee profile with bicarbonate
differs from that with acetate in a shallow maximum of 33% ee (at
∼100 mM), while the ee rises in a linear fashion with an increased
acetate concentration, reaching an ee of 45% at 500 mM. Because the
carboxylate moiety appears to be an ideal promoter for stereoselective
hydration, a set of carboxylic acid sodium salts with varying chain
lengths, substituents, and branching patterns was compared at neutral
pH (7.0) (Figure 1b).
Significant positive effects on the stereoselectivity were detected
with all aliphatic carboxylates, depending on the side-chain size
(Et > iPr > tBu ≈ Me ≈ H)
with
a maximum for propanoate (74% ee). Trifluoroacetate enhanced neither
conversion nor the ee, because of its low pKa, which disables it to act as a catalytic acid in proton transfer
(cf. Scheme 2). Because
of the formation of an unidentified side product, only 60% of the
starting material was recovered in the presence of formate.

Figure 1 Asymmetric
hydration in the presence of (anionic) additives. Conditions:
substrate 1 [10 mM, from a 10% (w/w) propylene glycol
solution] in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM), and lyophilized Escherichia coli cells containing wild-type FDC_Es (20 mg/mL, 32 units). Effect of (a) various anions (0.5
M, pH 8.0) and (b) different carboxylates (0.5 M, pH 7.0) on enzymatic
hydration (additives are shown in the respective protonation state
at the corresponding pH).

On the basis of these promising results, we envisioned the
design
of mutants bearing a “tethered carboxylate” acting as
a catalytic residue in the active site to mediate the proton transfer,27 thereby waiving the need for an external bicarbonate/carboxylate
“cofactor”. The amino acid residues introduced should
meet two crucial requirements. (i) The spatial arrangement in the
active site needs to mimic bound bicarbonate, suggesting residues
near the bicarbonate binding site as targets for mutagenesis, and
(ii) residues must be chemically competent surrogates of bicarbonate/carboxylate
to shuttle protons between the substrate Cβ atom and Glu72.

After detailed inspection of active-site residues of FDC_Es, Val46 located on a mobile loop in the vicinity to the
bicarbonate binding site was selected for mutations. On the basis
of their ability to act as a three-atom proton shuttle, Val46 was
exchanged with Glu, Gln, Asp, His, and Arg (Figure 2). The validity of this strategy was proven
by the fact that the introduction of a carboxylate group at position
46 with aspartate (Val46Asp) or glutamate (Val46Glu) enhanced the
stereoselectivity 39-fold and boosted the conversion by ∼40%.
The slightly higher stereoselectivity (∼6%) for the Asp versus
the Glu mutant may be explained by the tether that is one CH2 unit shorter and pulls the water nucleophile
farther out of the plane of symmetry toward the si face of the substrate (Figure 3). Apparently, only a carboxylate moiety is an efficient
bicarbonate/acetate mimic, because mutations to histidine, glutamine,
and arginine were not beneficial (maximum 57% conversion for Val46Arg).
However, despite its lower activity, the Val46His mutant showed slight
stereoselectivity (up to 17% ee).

Figure 2 FDC_Es variants with
tethered bicarbonate/acetate
surrogates in positions Val46 and Arg49 (indicated by dashed circles).
The quinone methide form of substrate 4-vinylphenol (green) was docked
into the active site of FDC_Es (Protein Data Bank
entry 4UU3)
using the UCSF Chimera AutoDock Vina plug-in. Catalytic key residues
are colored blue; Val46 is colored red, and others are colored gray.
Dotted red spheres indicate water molecules in the superimposed apo
structure. Surrogate residues at positions 46 and 49 are shown in
their protonation state at pH 7.0. Conditions: substrate 1 (10 mM) in potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.0), and lyophilized E. coli whole cells containing FDC_Es variants
(20 mg/mL).

Figure 3 Overlay of the active-site
structures of the FDC_Es Val46Glu and Val46Asp variants
(Swissmodel Web server). Mutated
residues Asp/Glu46 are colored orange, and the docked quinone methide
form of the substrate 4-vinylphenol is colored green (Autodock Vina
plug-in, UCSF Chimera). Water molecules shown as red spheres are derived
from the superimposed wild-type FDC_Es crystal structure
(Protein Data Bank entry 4UU3). Distances are given in angstroms.

A homology model of the Val46Asp/Glu mutants reveals
that the additional
carboxylate groups are well positioned in the proximity of a water
molecule (W1) to activate it as nucleophile within the hydrogen bond
network of Tyr27, Glu72, and Arg49 (Figure 3). Changing the latter to a glutamate residue
(thereby inverting the positive charge at this position into a negative
one) could yield some additional hydration activity (86% conversion)
but yielded a racemic product. Tyr39 was suggested to dictate the
(S)-stereoselectivity through steric repulsion between
its aromatic ring and the Cβ atom of the quinone methide intermediate,
which consequently presents its si face to the water
nucleophile located above the plane (Scheme 2).26 A double
variant having both the beneficial Val46Glu mutation and a neutral
Arg49Met mutation did not affect the conversion but showed a decrease
in stereoselectivity compared to that of the single mutant. Removal
of the hydrogen bond donor Arg49 weakens the bonding network and renders
Tyr39 less rigid, which is responsible for the lower ee of the product.
The Val46Glu mutant was also tested with other nucleophiles (methoxyamine
and cyanide),19 which gave improved stereoselectivities
compared to that of the wild-type enzyme (Table S3).

The reaction conditions for the rationally designed
“hydratases”
were optimized in terms of pH, and effects of various organic co-solvents
were examined (Figure S5). Furthermore,
the stereoselectivity of the process was found to increase with a
decrease in temperature (Figure S4), indicating
a major contribution of the enthalpy difference (ΔΔH⧧) to the free energy difference between
the enantiomeric transition states (ΔΔG⧧).28,29

Finally, hydration of 1 was achieved with the Val46Glu
and Val46Asp variants with a maximum turnover number of ∼220
and a product ee of ≤91% with 50 mM substrate loading at pH
6.0 and 25 °C (Tables S1 and S2).
The process was subsequently performed on a 100 mg scale with 0.8
mol % of FDC_Es V46E to afford 68 mg of (S)-hydrate product (60% yield) with a high enantiomer purity
(96% ee after recrystallization) underpinning the usability of this
reaction on a preparative scale.

In conclusion, prompted by
the observation of bicarbonate- and
acetate-assisted asymmetric hydration of hydroxystyrenes catalyzed
by ferulic acid decarboxylase, we rationally designed a hydratase
from this decarboxylase through mutation of an Asp- or Glu-carboxylate
moiety into the active site, which efficiently functions as a proton
shuttle. The mutants showed 40% higher activity and 39-fold improved
stereoselectivity, which allowed preparative-scale transformations
with turnover numbers of ≤220.
