The
development of synthetic methodologies which provide access
to both stereoisomers of α,β-disubstituted olefins is
a challenging undertaking. Herein, we describe the development of
an operationally simple and stereoselective synthesis of difluoromethylated
styrenes via a visible-light photocatalytic decarboxylation strategy
using fac-Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst.
Meta- and para-substituted cinnamic acids provide the expected E-isomer. In contrast, ortho-substituted
cinnamic acids yield selectively the less stable Z-product, whereas the E-isomer can be obtained via
continuous-flow processing through accurate control of the reaction
time. Furthermore, our protocol is amenable to the decarboxylative
difluoromethylation of aryl propiolic acids.

==== Body
The introduction of fluorinated
moieties into organic compounds has resulted in a dramatic enhancement
of their physical, chemical, and biological properties, rendering
medicinal and agrochemical compounds to be more potent.1 Consequently, in recent years, a tremendous amount
of research effort has been devoted to develop new methods to enable
the efficient incorporation of fluorinated moieties into parent molecules.2 Among these, the CF2 motif plays an
increasingly important role, since the hydrogen bond donor properties
of the difluoromethyl group increases acidity of its neighboring group,
which enhances dipole moments and conformational changes in the molecules.3 In recent years, great progress has been made
with regard to radical difluoroalkylation reactions, especially via
visible-light photoredox catalysis.4 Visible
light photoredox catalysis has become one of the most powerful tools
in organic synthesis wherein both single electron transfer (SET) and
triplet–triplet energy transfer (TTET) processes with organic
substrates can be facilitated.5

With
biomass feedstocks of vinyl carboxylic acids abundantly available,
these inexpensive and stable compounds have attracted a great deal
of attention as substrates for a wide variety of synthetic transformations.6 Perhaps the most widely used decarboxylative
fluoroalkylation strategy involves transition-metal coordination in
combination with high temperatures or strong oxidants to facilitate
the CO2 extrusion process (Scheme 1A).7 It is evident
that such harsh reaction conditions have repercussions on the substrate
scope. Photocatalytic strategies have allowed the decarboxylative
functionalization process to proceed at room temperature but still
require stoichiometric amounts of strong oxidants or transition metals
(Scheme 1B).8,9 In addition, all these methods give access to the thermodynamically
more stable E-alkenes,10 while methods delivering selectively the Z-isomers
are far less common.11

Scheme 1 (A) Classical Decarboxylative
Cross-Coupling Strategies. (B) Recent
Photocatalytic Approaches Still Require the Use of Metals or Hypervalent
Iodine Reagents (HIR) to Enable the Decarboxylation Step. (C) Our
Strategy for the Photocatalytic Radical Difluoromethylation of Cinnamic
Acids
The strategy we describe here
involves a photocatalytic decarboxylation
methodology to access difluoroalkenes, which is operationally simple,
mild and requires no additional transition metals or oxidants to enable
CO2 extrusion (Scheme 1C). Moreover, with ortho-substituted
cinnamic acid substrates, Z-isomers could be obtained
in high selectivity. The corresponding E-isomer could
be accessed as well via continuous-flow processing through accurate
control of the reaction time. To the best of our knowledge, having
access to both stereoisomers simply by changing the reactor has never
been reported before and constitutes a powerful approach to tune reaction
selectivity for photoredox catalysis.

Building on our recent
experience with the direct trifluoromethylation
of styrenes,10a we commenced our investigations
by using fac-Ir(ppy)3 as the photocatalyst
(Table 1). The targeted
product could be obtained in a 31% yield and with an E/Z ratio of 52:48 using 3 equiv of ethyl bromodifluoroacetate 2 and KOAc as a base (Table 1, entry 1). Interestingly, no metal cocatalyst or hypervalent
iodine reagent (HIR) was required to facilitate the CO2 extrusion. The rather poor E/Z selectivity can be explained due to the high triplet energy level
of the fac-Ir(ppy)3 photocatalyst (ET = 2.41 eV).12 Consequently,
a triplet–triplet energy transfer occurs leading to an erosion
of the stereoselectivity.11 Various solvents
and bases were subsequently screened (Table 1, entries 1–6); the best results were
obtained using 1,4 dioxane as a solvent and NaHCO3 as the
base. Addition of water provided an improved yield but a decreased
selectivity (Table 1, entry 7). Optimal results were obtained when the concentration
was reduced to 0.1 M leading to a 68% yield and an excellent E/Z selectivity (94:6) (Table 1, entry 8). Lastly, control
experiments confirmed the photocatalytic nature of our transformation,
as no reaction was observed in the absence of photocatalyst and/or
light (Table 1, entries
9 and 10).

Having identified the optimal reaction conditions
for the photocatalytic
difluoromethylation of cinnamic acid, we aimed to define the reaction
scope (Table 2). Our
protocol was found to readily accommodate a variety of para- and meta-substituted cinnamic acids, including
electron-neutral (3a–d), electron-donating
(3e–g), and electron-withdrawing
substituents (3h–n). Overall, the E/Z ratio was good to excellent for all
these examples. In addition, the presence of halogens was well tolerated,
providing opportunities for further decoration of the molecule, e.g.,
via cross coupling (3k–n). In addition,
heterocyclic substrates, such as pyridine (3o) and thiophene
(3p), were found to be competent substrates. The pyridine
analogue displayed an excellent E/Z selectivity (99:1), while the thiophene one was obtained with a
lower stereoselectivity (61:39). Extended conjugation, e.g., for (2E,4E)-5-phenylpenta-2,4-dienoic acid, was
tolerated as well, delivering the corresponding product (3q) in good yield and excellent selectivity (81%, 99:1). Also, β-substituted
cinnamic acids, e.g., 1,1-diphenylethylene (3r), could
be successfully subjected to our reaction conditions resulting in
a good isolated yield (81% yield). The lower E/Z selectivity in some cases prompted us to evaluate the
efficacy of fac-Ir(tBuppy)3. This photocatalyst was recently reported by Weaver et al. and was
shown to lower the energy transfer rate due to the increased steric
bulk.11a However, while an increase in
yield was observed, the E/Z selectivity
only marginally improved (Table 2, 3b and 3p).

(2.0 mL), argon, blue LEDs (3.12 W), 24 h.

b Reported yields are those of isolated

c fac-Ir(tBuppy)3 was used as the photocatalyst.

d Reaction time, 30 h.

e Due to the limited solubility of
the substrate, the yield is lower for compound 3o. However,
the yield could be increased by recycling the unreacted starting material.

However, when ortho-substituted cinnamic acids
were evaluated, a selectivity switch was observed toward the Z product (Table 3, entry 1). Interestingly, the use of fac-Ir(tBuppy)3 completely altered the selectivity
(Table 3, entry 2),
confirming the observations of Weaver et al.11a We were delighted to find that an increase in concentration resulted
in an improvement in both yield and selectivity (Table 3, entry 1 and 3). A further
increase in catalyst loading and concentration contributed to an enhancement
of the selectivity toward the Z isomer (Table 3, entries 4–6).
Kinetic experiments revealed that the thermodynamically more stable E-isomer was formed first, after which the Z-isomer was obtained via a triplet–triplet energy transfer
mechanism (TTET) (see the Supporting Information).11b Consequently, it should theoretically
be possible to stop the reaction before E/Z isomerization
occurs. In order to obtain high conversions in a short amount of time,
we turned our attention to the use of continuous-flow microreactors
which allow to accelerate photocatalytic reactions due to an improved
irradiation profile and enhanced mass transfer characteristics (Table 3, entries 7–11).13,14 In flow, the reaction time could be reduced significantly resulting
in a reversed E/Z selectivity (Table 3, entry 7). An increase
in catalyst loading and concentration could further reduce the reaction
time to 15 min resulting in an excellent E selectivity
(62%, 92:8) (Table 3, entry 11).15 Longer residence times
lead to an increase in yield but an erosion of the selectivity (Table 3, entries 8 and 9).
However, it should be noted that it was possible to recover the starting
material quantitatively, which can be subsequently reintroduced into
the flow reactor obtaining higher overall conversions while maintaining
a high stereoselectivity (see Table 4, 5g and 3p).

e Reported

Next, a diverse set of ortho-substituted
cinnamic
acids were examined in both batch and flow (Table 4). Cinnamic acids bearing electron-neutral (5a), electron-donating (5b–d) and
electron-withdrawing substituents (5e) could be difluoromethylated
in high Z-selectivity in batch, while the corresponding E-isomer could be readily accessed via continuous-flow processing.
Also, o-halogenated cinnamic acids were competent
substrates (5f–i). Enhanced selectivity
for the Z-isomer was observed with increasing steric
bulk (F < Cl < Br). Interestingly, when both ortho positions were occupied with bulky groups (e.g., 5k,l), a high Z-selectivity was observed
which could not be revoked via continuous-flow processing. This observation
highlights the need for sterical bulk in the ortho-position to access the Z-stereoisomer. Furthermore,
in the case of β-methyl-substituted cinnamic acids, a similar
trend in the selectivity was observed due to the steric effect of
the β-substituent (5m–o). Finally,
substrates with a low E-selectivity in batch (e.g.,
substrate 3p) could be obtained in flow with an improved
stereoselectivity.

To further
demonstrate the utility of our protocol, we sought to
demonstrate its potential for the decarboxylative difluoromethylation
of aryl propiolic acids. A small tweak of the reaction conditions
(i.e., CsOAc as a base) resulted in the formation of the desired compounds
in modest but synthetically useful yields (Table 5). Our protocol was successfully applied
to ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted aryl propiolic acids (7a–l). These findings are noteworthy because, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first time that propiolic acids are used as substrates
for photocatalytic decarboxylation chemistry.6a,6b

24 h.

b Reported yields are
those of isolated
compounds.

Based on the
above results, we suggest a plausible mechanism for
the developed transformation as outlined in Scheme 2. Photoexcitation of fac-Ir(ppy)3 upon blue irradiation results in a metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (MLCT) excited state. Photoluminescence quenching
experiments showed that the photoexcited fac-[Ir3+(ppy)3]* (E1/2red [*Ir3+/Ir4+] = −1.72 V vs
SCE) can be quenched by 2 (Ered = −0.57 V vs SCE)12c at a rate
constant of 1.84 × 108 M–1 s–1. Our investigations also showed that the excited
photocatalyst can be quenched by cinnamate A though at
a lower rate constant of 1.24 × 108 M–1 s–1. However, radical trapping experiments showed
that only the key intermediate •CF2CO2Et could be captured by BHT (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol)
suggesting the feasibility of this oxidative quenching pathway. Next,
intermolecular π-addition of the radical to A produces
the benzylic radical B. Single-electron transfer from
radical B to fac-[Ir(ppy)3]+ affords carbocation C and facilitates
subsequent CO2 extrusion to yield the E stereoisomer. The formation of E isomer as both
the thermodynamically and kinetically preferred isomer is supported
by kinetic experiments (see the Supporting Information). The Z isomer is subsequently formed due to a
triplet–triplet energy transfer process with fac-[Ir3+(ppy)3]* (τ0 = 1.9 μs5a and ET = 2.41 eV12a,12b).

Scheme 2 Proposed Catalytic Cycle for the Decarboxylative Difluoromethylation
In this work, we have introduced
a simple yet effective photocatalytic
decarboxylative protocol to prepare difluoromethylated styrenes and
phenylacetylenes. In contrast to previously described methods, this
procedure does not require additional metal catalysts or hypervalent
iodine reagents to facilitate CO2 extrusion. The generality
of our protocol is demonstrated by the broad substrate scope (difluoromethylated
styrenes, 31 E-selective examples and 15 Z-selective; difluoromethylated phenylacetylenes, 12 examples). Ortho-substituted cinnamic acids give the less stable Z-selective products. The thermodynamically favored E-stereoisomer could be readily obtained in continuous-flow
through accurate control of the reaction time. Having access to both
stereoisomers simply by changing the reactor is a unique and powerful
approach and provides opportunities for other photocatalytic transformations.
