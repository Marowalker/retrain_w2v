An operationally simple, mild, redox-neutral
method for the photoredox
alkylation of imines is reported. Utilizing an inexpensive organic
photoredox catalyst, alkyl radicals are readily generated from the
single-electron oxidation of ammonium alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates
and are subsequently engaged in a C–C bond-forming reaction
with imines. The process is highly selective, metal-free, and does
not require a large excess of the alkylating reagent or the use of
acidic additives.

==== Body
The resurgence of visible-light
photoredox catalysis over the past decade has resulted in an influx
of synthetically valuable methods for the construction of compounds
whose synthesis would be challenging using two-electron reaction manifolds.1 Photoredox catalysts, by precisely controlling
the rate of radical generation, facilitate selective reactions that
would be extremely difficult using stoichiometric reagents where reactive
radical species are present in noncatalytic quantities. These photoredox-mediated
processes contrast with radical chain processes where unproductive
redox quenching and undesired side reactions are often unavoidable.
As a result, photoredox-mediated single electron transfer (SET) processes
have led to a revival of radical-based chemistry and are already being
adopted for the construction of complex molecules where traditional
radical approaches are incompatible.1

Recently, our group and others have developed powerful methods
for generating and engaging Csp3-centered radicals in a
dual-catalytic cross-coupling system.2 The
identification of benchtop-stable precursors from which radicals can
be photocatalytically generated via SET oxidation or reduction is
an underlying hurdle that must be overcome in the development of this
type of catalysis. In the course of our investigations, our group
and others have reported that alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates readily
undergo SET oxidation under photoredox conditions and are viable radical
precursors in photoredox/nickel dual catalysis.3 Ultimately, it has been shown that alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates
serve as progenitors for both primary and secondary alkyl radicals
that can be engaged in numerous processes including: (1) Csp2–Csp3 cross-couplings with aryl halides/(pseudo)halides
and alkenyl halides,3,4 (2) the functionalization of azaborine
isosteres,5 and (3) the synthesis of thioethers
via H atom transfer.6 When compared with
other radical precursors, alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates pose a number
of advantages, specifically the ability to undergo homolysis under
neutral conditions as well as the ability to be oxidized at relatively
low and uniform oxidation potentials (Eox = 0.34 to 0.90 V).3 Despite having been
discovered in 1964, these hypervalent silicate species have few known
synthetic applications.7 Thus, in light
of this deficiency and their numerous advantages as radical precursors,
we initiated a program to explore their utility in radical-mediated
processes.

In the context of this program, we became interested
in the possibility
of using hypervalent silicon species to effect redox-neutral alkylation
processes, such as the alkylation of imines. Imines are widely used
as building blocks for preparing complex amine-containing, biologically
active compounds and heterocyclic species.8 Classical strategies rely on preformed organometallic reagents to
achieve efficient alkylation (Scheme 1a), but more recently, radical-based methods have emerged
as versatile, functional-group-tolerant approaches for accessing complex
amines.8,9 Classical radical-based methods generate
radicals using a Et3B/O2 system or reductants
(tin reagents or Zn).9 The source of alkyl
radical is typically alkyl iodides (Scheme 1b).9 Photoredox
catalysis has been instrumental in furthering this radical-based approach
by enabling regulated radical generation under milder conditions.10 Recent reports in this vein have accomplished
the radical alkylation process elegantly and even with some degree
of stereocontrol.10a Although these methods
furnish attractive diamines or amino alcohols, the focus of these
strategies was on the installation of α-heteroatom-stabilized
radicals.10a Thus, these previous methods
do not provide a general solution to the radical alkylation of imines.
We envisioned that alkyl bis(catecholato)silicates with alkylammonium
counterions would be uniquely poised to fill this methodological gap
because of their capacity to serve as efficient progenitors for a
variety of radicals (1°, 2°, and benzylic) under mild, photocatalytic
conditions. The radicals generated from these hypervalent silicon
species can be coupled with imines, and the resulting nitrogen anion
can then undergo protonation by the acidic ammonium cation to afford
the desired alkylated product (Scheme 1). Moreover, unlike prior reports, which utilize expensive
organometallic photocatalysts,10 organic
photocatalysts such as 4CzIPN, 1, were anticipated to
facilitate the SET events necessary for this process to occur.11

to Imines by Alkylsilicate Radical Precursors vs Standard Alkylation
Approaches: (a) via Traditional Organometallic Reagents; (b) via Stoichiometric
Generation of Radicals; (c) Alternate Photoredox-Based Approach Using
Alkylsilicates
On the basis of reported successes
of N-sulfonyl
aldimines as radical acceptors10a and our
own experiences with these hypervalent silicon species as effective
oxidative radical precursors, we attempted photoredox-mediated alkylation
using the p-tolyl imine 2a and cyclohexylsilicate 3a with the organometallic photocatalyst Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 in DMF. Although alkylation was observed,
the reaction generally proceeded slowly, thus requiring higher photocatalyst
loadings, longer reaction times, and/or photocatalysts with longer
excited-state lifetimes (i.e., [Ir{dFCF3ppy}2(bpy)]PF6).1 Solvent optimization
studies revealed that DMSO was the ideal solvent for this transformation.12 In this solvent, numerous photocatalysts, including
organic photocatalysts (Table 1, entries 1 and 6), efficiently facilitated alkylation. Moreover,
the stoichiometry of 3 could be lowered to just 1.1 equiv,
speaking to the efficiency of the described reaction, which starkly
contrasts with the stoichiometric radical-based methods where a large
excess of the radical precursor is needed.9 Control experiments confirmed that this reaction required both irradiation
and a photocatalyst to occur (see Supporting Information for details). Ultimately, we elected to use 4CzIPN (Table 1, entry 1), because it was the
most efficient as well as less costly and more sustainable compared
to its organometallic counterparts. We later found that we could halve
the photocatalyst loading and still effect complete alkylation, albeit
with longer reaction times (24 h).

HPLC analysis. The given potentials are vs the standard calomel electrode
(SCE).

After determining
suitable conditions, the scope of the alkylation
process was next explored in the context of various N-sulfonyl aldimines using cyclohexylsilicate 3a (Table 2). N-Methyl-, phenyl-, p-toluenesulfonyl, and even N,N-dimethylsulfamidyl aldimines (2a–c, 2n) were all competent
partners in this reaction, providing the desired products in good
yields (4a–c, 4n). Alkylation
of 2a could easily be scaled up (5 mmol, 10-fold increase)
with neither yield nor reaction time being compromised. Modulation
of the aryl ring with a variety of substituents was well-tolerated.
Both substantially electron donating (2i–k) and electron-withdrawing (2f–h, 2l–n) groups provided
products in good yields, regardless of the electronic nature of the
aryl backbone. Of particular note, imine alkylation proceeded smoothly
for a variety of halogen-substitutions, even for those that may be
prone to radical SNAr-type reactions, such as difluoro
imine 2g, thus providing a handle for further functionalization
of the amine products (e.g., 4f, 4h, or 4n). In addition, these substrates and those containing electrophilic
substituents (i.e., cyano- and ester-containing substrates 4l and 4m, respectively) would be incompatible with classical
organometallic-based approaches. Although aryl N-sulfonyl
imines were amenable to alkylation, attempts to use alkyl imines were
not met with success (4s). Beyond N-sulfonyl-protected
aryl imines, unprotected imines were also examined. Although N-alkyl imines gave no appreciable conversion, N-phenyl and N-pyridyl imines were competent toward
alkylation (4o–4r). These systems
were equally insensitive to electronic changes and underwent alkylation
with ease. In addition, subsequent oxidation of secondary amine products
was not observed. Unfortunately, this process could not be extended
to ketimines (e.g., 4t).

(1.0 equiv, 0.5 mmol), alkylsilicate (1.1 equiv), 4CzIPN (1 mol %),
DMSO (0.1 M), rt, 24 h.

b Yield in parentheses indicates yield
on a 5 mmol scale.

The generality
of this method was next explored in the context
of various alkylsilicates (Table 3). Numerous alkyl groups could be installed on imines
in varying electronic environments. We found that both classes of
imines, N-aryl as well as N-sulfonyl,
underwent alkylation in good yields. In these cases, the loading of
the alkylsilicate and the photocatalyst needed to be raised to 1.3
equiv and 3 mol %, respectively.13 This
is likely a consequence of off-cycle reactions consuming some of the
alkylsilicate (i.e., homocoupling and H atom abstraction processes).
Alkylsilicates that furnish stabilized (4v, 4w, and 4x) and nonstabilized (4y and 4z) primary radicals upon oxidation all performed well under
the reaction conditions, providing the desired products in good yields.
Additionally, protic groups as well as those that are prone to nucleophilic
addition processes could be installed with ease using this approach
(e.g., 4aa–4af). Importantly, this
method retained its tolerance of various aryl substituents regardless
of the alkylsilicate used.

b Reactions performed using 3 mol
% Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 instead of 4CzIPN.

Mechanistically, we hypothesized
that the described alkylation
process can proceed through two plausible pathways: (a) SET reduction
of the imine III to generate IVa, a possible
“persistent” radical,14 followed
by radical–radical coupling with II, generated
from I upon SET oxidation (Figure 1a), or (b) addition of alkyl radical II to imine III, followed by reduction of the
resulting N-centered radical IVb (Figure 1b). To probe the mechanism, electrochemical
data were obtained for four classes of imines (Table 4) and compared to the redox potential of
photocatalyst 1 (Table 1).11a On the basis of these
data, Mechanism B is more probable for N-aryl imines,
because of the unfavorable reduction of imine III to
form IVa. Although this mechanism is also likely operative
for N-sulfonyl imines, Mechanism A cannot be ruled
out given the small difference between the reduced ground state of
4CzIPN and these imines (<0.2 V). Indeed, reduction of N-sulfonyl imines by photoredox catalysts to generate “persistent”
radical anions has been suggested previously.10a

Table 4 Measured E1/2 of Imines Using Cyclic Voltammetry
To demonstrate the broad utility of alkylsilicates
for installation
of Csp3 groups, a successive alkylation and cross-coupling
sequence was executed using brominated imine 2n (Scheme 2). First, alkylation
using imine 2n with 3l was performed on
a 5 mmol scale to both reaffirm the scalability of the alkylation
process and furnish 4ak. Subsequently the product (4ak) was subjected to the Ni/photoredox dual-catalytic conditions
previously reported by our group,3a affording
the elaborated cross-coupled product 4al in 73% yield.

Scheme 2 Successive Photoredox-Catalyzed Alkylation/Cross-Coupling Reactions
Alkylsilicates
Finally, to probe
the limits of the described method, selective
alkylation of an aldehyde-containing imine was attempted. In this
competition study, imine 2v underwent facile alkylation
with complete chemoselectivity (Scheme 3). This result is in line with the enhanced electrophilic
character of sulfonyl aldimines over their aldehyde congeners in DMSO.15 Thus, in this case, the radical is behaving
in a similar manner to soft carbanions without the inherent sensitivity
toward protic groups.

Scheme 3 Chemoselectivity in Photoredox Alkylation
In summary, a simple, scalable,
and efficient method for the alkylation
of imines under photoredox conditions is described. The method avoids
traditional, superstoichiometric radical initiators and utilizes an
organic photoredox catalyst to mediate radical generation. A variety
of protected and unprotected amines can be accessed via this alkylation
strategy under mild, net-neutral conditions. This method is less restrictive
in scope than many previously reported methods because it facilitates
the installation of various alkyl groups, including those containing
protic functional groups and those originating from nonstabilized
radicals. Additionally, the resulting products can be further elaborated
by employing the same radical progenitors used for the alkylation.
Therefore, this synthetic method has the capacity to be combined with
others to generate structural diversity rapidly.
