Photoredox catalysis has experienced
a revitalized interest from
the synthesis community during the past decade. For example, photoredox/Ni
dual catalysis protocols have been developed to overcome several inherent
limitations of palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings by invoking a single-electron
transmetalation pathway. This Perspective highlights advances made
by our laboratory since the inception of the photoredox/Ni cross-coupling
of benzyltrifluoroborates with aryl bromides. In addition to broadening
the scope of trifluoroborate coupling partners, research using readily
oxidized hypervalent silicates as radical precursors that demonstrate
functional group compatibility is highlighted. The pursuit of electrophilic
coupling partners beyond (hetero)aryl bromides has also led to the
incorporation of several new classes of C(sp2)-hybridized
substrates into light-mediated cross-coupling. Advances to expand
the radical toolbox by utilizing feedstock chemicals (e.g., aldehydes)
to access radicals that were previously inaccessible from trifluoroborates
and silicates are also emphasized. Additionally, several organic photocatalysts
have been investigated as replacements for their expensive iridium-
and ruthenium-based counterparts. Lastly, the net C–H functionalization
of the radical partner in an effort to improve atom economy is presented.
An underlying theme in all of these studies is the value of generating
radicals in a catalytic manner, rather than stoichiometrically.

Introduction
Over the past eight years, a resurgence
of interest in photoinduced
electron transfer has resulted in a new class of organic transformations.1 The ability to harness over 60 kcal/mol of visible
light energy to activate redox-labile substrates—via the intermediacy
of a photoredox catalyst—has enabled reactions under extraordinarily
mild conditions compared to alternative two-electron modes of activation.
Since the 1970s, the properties of transition metal photocatalysts
(PC) have been studied, revealing that photoexcited transition metal
catalysts can either undergo a single-electron oxidation or reduction
(Scheme 1). One of
the first synthetic applications of a photoredox catalyst was reported
by Deronzier, wherein a ruthenium photocatalyst was used in a Pschorr-type
transformation via a single-electron reduction of an aryl diazonium
moiety.2 More recently, Yoon,3 MacMillan,4 and Stephenson5 employed Ru(bpy)3 to perform cycloadditions,
α-alkylation of aldehydes, and dehalogenation, respectively,
through both oxidative and reductive quenching pathways. Following
these seminal reports, numerous groups have developed creative applications
with a variety of photocatalysts.6

Scheme 1 Oxidative and Reductive Pathways of Photocatalysts
Our group became interested in photoredox catalysis
as a tool to
generate alkyl radicals for use in cross-coupling reactions. In 2014,
we disclosed the first example of photoredox/Ni dual catalysis to
forge C(sp2)–C(sp3) bonds under unusually
mild reaction conditions.7 In this transformation,
photoredox/Ni dual catalysis proceeds via the single-electron
oxidative fragmentation of radical precursors and alkyl radical addition to a nickel catalyst,
a process we refer to as single-electron transmetalation (Scheme 2). The addition
of the radical to the nickel complex using this protocol is the synthetic
equivalent of the more traditional two-electron transmetalation, and
the activation energy for this process is extraordinarily low.8 This is in stark contrast to typical Pd- or Ni-catalyzed
processes, where transmetalation from an organometallic nucleophile to a metal center is often the rate-determining step with a high
energy of activation.9

Scheme 2 Photoredox/Nickel
Dual Catalysis Cycle
This Perspective details the efforts of our laboratory
to expand
the scope of photocatalytic routes to radicals by targeting three
major components of the dual catalytic cycle for improvement (Scheme 2): the radical precursor
(A), the electrophilic coupling partner (B), and the photocatalyst (C). Beyond trifluoroborate
and hypervalent silicate reagents previously exploited,1a we sought complementary radical precursors derived
from feedstock chemicals (e.g., aldehydes), to engage in single-electron
transmetalation processes. Furthermore, the development of
protocols for the inclusion of electrophiles other than hetero(aryl)bromides
is discussed. Additionally, our efforts in the arylation of alkyl
C(sp3)–H bonds using photoredox/Ni dual catalysis
are detailed.

Another important accomplishment was the inclusion
of competent,
inexpensive, and sustainable organic photoredox catalysts10 (Scheme 3) in many of the developed protocols. Building upon Zhang’s
report that 4CzIPN (4) can serve as a surrogate of transition
metal-based photocatalysts 1, 2, and 3 within the photoredox/Ni manifold,11 we began to incorporate it into newly developed cross-couplings.
We have also exploited the favorable properties of the mesityl acridinium
dye (5)12 and Eosin Y (6) to effect metal-free couplings.

Scheme 3 Transition-Metal-Based
and Organic Photocatalysts
An overarching theme that has evolved is the catalytic generation of radicals via photoredox processes that enables transformations
that would be challenging, if not impossible, to carry out under conditions
in which stoichiometric reagents were utilized to generate these same
radicals.

PHOTOREDOX/NICKEL DUAL CATALYSIS
The many challenges
of transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling
of sp3-hybridized nucleophilic species with sp2-hybridized electrophiles led our group6 and others4 to develop cross-coupling
protocols based upon single-electron transformations (Scheme 2). The major advantage of using
radical intermediates in such catalytic cycles derived from the extraordinarily
rapid capture of these open-shell species by the transition-metal
cross-coupling catalysts in an event we termed “single-electron
transmetalation”. The success of these processes derived ultimately
from the fact that these radicals were generated catalytically in
a process that was tightly regulated and innately controlled by the
intertwinement of the photoredox cycle and the cross-coupling cycle.
Thus, adjustment of the electronic nature and concentration of the
individual catalysts are used to regulate the concentration of the
radicals generated. This is critical to the success of the overall
process because such highly reactive intermediates, left to themselves,
are subject to a variety of deleterious side-reactions, including
dimerization and disproportionation. Catalytic generation of the key
reactive intermediates was thus critical for the success of these
intricately fused cycles and provided the crucial, enabling transformations
that could not be accomplished using stoichiometric methods based,
for example, on tin hydride or electrochemical processes.

Alkyltrifluoroborates
and Alkylsilicates
Alkyltrifluoroborates
are exceptional reagents for photoredox processes, primarily because
of their low oxidation potentials, benchtop stability, and commercial
availability.13 Additionally, complex alkyltrifluoroborates
can be accessed via a variety of complementary pathways, including
β-borylation of conjugated carbonyl substrates,14 substitution of halomethyltrifluoroborates, and so on.15 From the seminal cross-coupling of benzyltrifluoroborates,
the exploration of different classes of trifluoroborates has led to
the fruitful incorporation of secondary alkyl,16 α-alkoxy,17 α-amino,18 and α-trifluoromethyl19 subunits into similar manifolds.

To expand the scope
of radical precursors with complementary reactivity, the compatibility
of bis(catecholato)alkylsilicates was evaluated in photoredox-/Ni-catalyzed
cross-couplings. Hypervalent silicon compounds have been shown to
be readily oxidized, affording the corresponding alkyl radicals as
initially demonstrated by Nishigaichi and co-workers.20 The groups of Goddard, Ollivier, and Fensterbank also demonstrated
that radicals derived from photooxidation of pentavalent bis(catecholato)silicates
readily participated in allylation, vinylation/alkynylation, conjugate
addition, and nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.21 With an improved synthetic route to access alkyl
ammonium bis(catecholato)silicates, our group built a library of silicate
radical precursors containing epoxide, amine, and chloride functional
groups from the corresponding trimethoxysilanes (Scheme 4).22

Scheme 4 Building a Library of Silicates
As with alkyltrifluoroborates, alkylsilicates are crystalline
solids
or free-flowing powders that are indefinitely bench-stable. Alkylsilicates
have the added advantage of avoiding formation of the deleterious
byproduct BF3, which requires the use of basic sequestering
agents in cross-coupling protocols. Furthermore, the lower oxidation
potentials (Ered = +0.75 V vs SCE) allowed
the transition from iridium photocatalysts to the significantly less
expensive Ru(bpy)3(2PF6)1b and even organic photocatalysts. Additionally, alkylsilicates
tend to be more soluble than trifluoroborate salts, which can be an
important consideration in their adaptation to photoflow conditions.
These advantages enabled photoredox/Ni dual cross-coupling with exquisite
functional group tolerance (e.g., substrates containing amines and
protic functional groups).

Secondary Alkyl β-Trifluoroborato Ketones
In
2011, our group reported the β-borylation of α,β-unsaturated
amide and carbonyl compounds using a readily available copper catalyst
with bisboronic acid.14 Subsequently, we
successfully engaged secondary alkyl β-trifluoroboratoamides
in palladium-catalyzed cross-couplings.23 Unfortunately, efforts to couple alkyl β-trifluoroborato ketones
or -esters under similar conditions primarily resulted in β-hydride
elimination. Other routes to similar synthons include the generation
of organozinc and -lithium reagents, which also result in unproductive
side reactions, specifically an intramolecular attack on the carbonyl
to afford the corresponding cyclopropanolates.24 Therefore, we hypothesized that coupling the secondary
alkyl β-trifluoroborato ketones and -esters via single-electron
transmetalation using photoredox/Ni dual catalysis could address this
unsolved challenge.25

Optimization
of reaction conditions revealed that the Ir[dFCF3ppy]2(bpy)PF6 photocatalyst (2.5 mol %), NiCl2·dme (2.5 mol %)/dtbbpy (2.5 mol %) cross-coupling catalyst,
Cs2CO3 (0.5 equiv), and 2,6-lutidine (0.5 equiv)
in dioxane afforded the highest conversion to product. Impressively,
this coupling tolerated a wide range of potentially sensitive functional
groups (e.g., aldehydes, ketones, esters, nitriles) and heteroaryl
partners (e.g., pyridine, pyrimidine, azaindole) as shown in Scheme 5.

Scheme 5 Coupling of Alkyl
β-Trifluoroborato Ketones
Secondary α-Alkoxy Alkyltrifluoroborates
Tackling
another challenging substrate class in palladium-catalyzed Suzuki
cross-couplings, we sought to utilize α-alkoxyalkyltrifluoroborates
in the dual catalytic manifold. Previous palladium-catalyzed approaches
toward the coupling of α-alkoxyalkyltrifluoroborates via two-electron
transmetalation pathways were limited by the need for excess base
(>5 equiv CsOH) and elevated temperatures (>100 °C), which
resulted
in extremely narrow functional group tolerance.26 In fact, only a benzylic ether protecting group (PG) was
compatible with the reaction conditions.20 We postulated that single-electron transmetalation would facilitate
a more general synthesis of protected secondary alcohol derivatives.27 The mild, optimized reaction conditions associated
with the dual catalytic cross-coupling manifold readily lent themselves
toward a protecting group-independent and functional group-tolerant
strategy to access a broad range of protected benzylic alcohol derivatives
(Scheme 6). Notably,
a fully unprotected carbohydrate was readily coupled in a synthetically
useful 68% yield.

Scheme 6 Coupling of Secondary α-Alkoxy Alkyltrifluoroborates
Construction of Functionalized
Chromanones
In an effort
to merge the β-trifluoroborato ketones and secondary α-alkoxyalkyltrifluoroborates,
we next targeted the biologically significant chromanone core, found
in myriad plant metabolites.28 Although
there have been a multitude of synthetic routes to access functionalized
chromanones,29 most disconnections involve
a chalcone intermediate, making derivatization of the C2-aryl ring
difficult. Conjugate addition of various arylmetallics to chromones
constitutes another logical approach, but from a diversity point of
view, this tactic is less than ideal because it requires the synthesis
of organometallic reagents, many of which are air- and moisture-sensitive.
We envisioned an alternate route where a trifluoroboratochromanone
serves as a radical precursor to access a wide array of 2-(hetero)aryl
chromanones rapidly using the corresponding aryl or heteroaryl halide
directly as coupling partners.30 This strategy
would take advantage of having access to thousands of commercially
available, structurally diverse aryl- and heteroaryl halides to elaborate
the chromanone core. The requisite 2-trifluoroboratochromanones were
prepared via the β-borylation of commercially available chromone
using an inexpensive copper catalyst and bisboronic acid on gram-scale
(Scheme 7).14

Scheme 7 Gram-Scale Preparation of Trifluoroboratochromanone
A variety of 2-(hetero)aryl-substituted
flavanones were synthesized
in one step under the operationally simple and mild reaction conditions
(Scheme 8). Aryl bromides
bearing electron-withdrawing substituents in the meta- and para-positions
that may also subsequently serve as building blocks were well-tolerated.
Additionally, a variety of heteroaryl bromides provided the desired
flavanones in good yields. Lastly, chromones substituted on the aryl
subunit were also readily borylated and then subsequently arylated,
providing additional opportunities for diversification of the flavanone
core.

Scheme 8 Arylation of Trifluoroboratochromanones
Iterative Cross-Coupling Strategy
Although we demonstrated
that several reactive functional groups were untouched in the photoredox
dual cross-couplings (e.g., aldehydes, chlorides), our laboratory
sought to determine if boronate groups would also remain intact for
iterative cross-couplings.31 The combination
of photoredox/Ni dual catalysis at room temperature indeed allowed
the differentiation of reactivity sites based on the preferential
tendencies for tetracoordinate, C(sp3)-hybridized organoboron
reagents to engage in single-electron transmetalation, in contrast
to their tricoordinate, C(sp2)-hybridized counterparts.
Thus, reactive, tricoordinate, C(sp2)-hybridized organoboron
reagents that succumb to decomposition pathways such as oxidation
and protodeboronation during traditional Pd-mediated coupling conditions
remained intact using the orthogonal photoredox/Ni cross-coupling
protocols (Scheme 9).32

Scheme 9 Mechanism-Based Selective Coupling
Initially, benzyltrifluoroborate
was coupled with aryl bromides
bearing the C(sp2)-hybridized organoboron N-methyliminodiacetic acid (BMIDA) and 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (BDAN)
subunits to afford the desired products in 59% and 73% yields, respectively.
Tricoordinate boronate reagents were also successfully coupled and
then immediately oxidized to the corresponding alcohol because the
intermediates were found to be unstable when subjected to column chromatography.

To demonstrate the utility of this orthogonal cross-coupling strategy,
2-(4-bromo-3-chlorophenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane
was subjected to a series of modular functionalizations, beginning
with photoredox/Ni dual-catalytic cross-coupling, to provide the C(sp3)–C(sp2) coupled product. The crude product
was then directly diverted into either Suzuki or 1,4-addition manifolds
that chemoselectively activated the sp2-hybridized organoboron
lynchpin. Additional elaboration of the aryl chloride by Buchwald–Hartwig
or Suzuki cross-couplings provided expedient access to diversified
products without the need for protecting group manipulations (Scheme 10).

Scheme 10 Three-Step
Iterative Cross-Couplings
A similar, iterative strategy was pursued with ammonium
silicates
to provide alkylated aryl- and heteroaryl boronates, providing a complementary
approach (Scheme 11).33 [Ru(bpy)2](PF6)2, a significantly less expensive photocatalyst ($138/g)
than the commonly used Ir[dFCF3ppy]2(bpy)PF6 (>$1,000/g), was chosen because alkyl ammonium silicates
possess lower oxidation potentials (Ered = +0.75 V vs SCE). Comparable yields were also obtained when the
organophotocatalyst 4CzIPN ($6/gram) was utilized, which further improved
the sustainability of the reaction. An additional advantage to employing
ammonium silicate radical precursors with lower oxidation potentials
is the incorporation of primary, nonbenzylic radicals into the dual
cross-coupling manifold. Examination of the scope of the electrophilic,
iterative cross-coupling partners revealed that a variety of C(sp2)-hybridized boronate esters were tolerated under the optimized
reaction conditions, providing the target products in moderate to
excellent yields.

Scheme 11 Coupling Boronate-Containing Aryl Bromides
The standard conditions for
silicate coupling also proved to be
fruitful for iterative C(sp3)–C(sp2)
Suzuki cross-couplings. The crude, alkylated material could be carried
directly on to the next step to provide multifunctionalized molecules
in good yields (Scheme 12). When a bromo-substituted arylboronic acid was used, the
catechol boronate ester that formed during the alkylation step could
also be carried directly into a subsequent Suzuki reaction without
purification.

Scheme 12 One-Pot Iterative Cross-Couplings
Engaging New Electrophiles in Dual Catalysis
Cross-Coupling
with Triflates
Alternatives to aryl
halide electrophiles were also pursued for incorporation into dual
catalytic cross-coupling.34 Aryl sulfonates,
which are derived from different chemical feedstocks (phenols) than
the corresponding halides, were examined because of their ability
to undergo low-temperature oxidative addition toward ligated nickel
species.35 Preliminary screening revealed
that 4-acetylphenyltrifluoromethanesulfonate readily
participated in C(sp2)–C(sp3) cross-coupling
with a variety of primary and secondary alkylbis(catecholato)silicates
under conditions similar to those previously reported.14 Exploration of the aryl triflate scope revealed
that although electron-neutral and electron-poor triflates provided
product in acceptable yields, the use of electron-rich triflates resulted
in lower reactivity (Scheme 13).

Scheme 13 Silicate Scope with Aryl Triflates
Aryl tosylates and -mesylates, which display
improved bench stability
compared to aryl triflates, were also successfully coupled, although
lower yields were observed. Additionally, the relative rates of oxidative
addition of aryl bromides and aryl triflates onto Ni(I) was also investigated
using 8 (Scheme 14). In difunctionalized substrates, alkylation occurred exclusively
at the position bearing the bromide, indicating that oxidative addition
of aryl bromides is more rapid. This enables chemoselective transformations
of poly functionalized starting materials using dual catalysis.

Scheme 14 Probing Chemoselectivity and Sulfonate Scope
Acylation via Acid Chlorides
Further efforts to expand
the scope of halide electrophiles in the dual catalytic manifold beyond
aryl/heteroaryl moieties led to the examination of acyl chlorides.
Although acyl halides are known to react with organoboron “ate”
complexes in an intermolecular fashion, either air-sensitive trialkylboranes
or pyrophoric/toxic additives under forcing conditions were required.36 In contrast, we recognized that the extremely
mild conditions required to activate alkyltrifluoroborates for incorporation
into Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling would allow the direct synthesis
of alkyl ketones containing sensitive functional groups from bench
stable starting materials.37

A variety
of α-alkoxymethyltrifluoroborates containing versatile synthetic
lynchpins (i.e., alkenes, alkynes, amines) and heterocycles were readily
coupled under the optimized reaction conditions to provide aliphatic
α-alkoxy ketones and amides (Scheme 15).37a Secondary
alkyltrifluoroborates were also readily transformed into the corresponding
ketones under similar reaction conditions.37b For both sets of trifluoroborate coupling partners, the acyl chloride
was also varied to afford access to various dialkyl ketones. Lastly,
it was demonstrated that the use of (4R)-4-benzyl-2-oxazoline
for the cross-coupling led to the formation of an enantioenriched
ketone in modest er (81:19).

Scheme 15 Acylation of Trifluoroborates
New Radical Precursors
Our group hoped to access additional
chemical space via the development and implementation of novel radical
precursors. Recognizing several potential drawbacks of alkyltrifluoroborates
(e.g., formation of BF3) and silicates (poor atom economy,
limited commercial availability of silanes), we initially focused
our attention on the incorporation of readily available feedstock
chemicals bearing desirable functional groups (Scheme 16).

Scheme 16 Comparing Radical Sources
Hantzsch Esters From Aldehyde Feedstock Chemicals
Currently,
there are 12 000+ commercially available aldehydes, underlining
their potential as an important chemical feedstock for the generation
of radical precursors.38 Nishibayashi and
co-workers reported the synthesis of 4-alkyl-1,4-dihydropyridines
for use as latent radicals from various aldehydes.39 As shown in Scheme 17, the Hantzsch ester presumably undergoes a single-electron
oxidation to the radical cation followed by homolysis of the C–C
bond to form an alkyl radical. The resulting benzylic radicals were
then captured by a variety of 1,4-dicyanobenzenes. Additionally, the
Nishibayashi group moved beyond benzylic radicals to heteroatom-stabilized,
carbon-centered radicals (i.e., α-alkoxy, α-amino subunits).

Scheme 17 SET and C–C Bond Cleavage of DHPs
We surmised that the alkyl 1,4-dihydropyridines (DHPs)
could also
serve as an alternative radical source in a Ni/photoredox dual catalytic
manifold.40 A plausible mechanism is outlined
in Scheme 18. To initiate
the cycle, the DHP undergoes a single-electron oxidation followed
by concomitant C–C bond cleavage, forming a radical intermediate.
As described above, the radical is captured by ligated Ni(0), which
then undergoes oxidative addition toward the aryl bromide to provide
a Ni(III) intermediate. Reductive elimination to provide the product
and Ni(I) is followed by reduction of Ni(I) to Ni(0), closing both
catalytic cycles.

Scheme 18 Proposed Mechanism for DHP Coupling
During the optimization process, we discovered
that acetone was
a suitable solvent for the reaction, and additives were not required
because the DHP pyridine byproduct is unreactive under the dual catalytic
conditions. Additionally, the iridium photocatalyst was replaced with
the inexpensive organophotocatalyst 4CzIPN. To simplify the reaction
conditions even further, NiCl2·dme was precomplexed
with dtbbpy to form the bench- and air-stable nickel precatalyst Ni(dtbbpy)Cl2·4H2O on multigram scale.

With dioxolane
DHP in hand, a wide variety of aryl and heteroaryl
bromides was examined. A few notable examples are showcased in Scheme 19. A variety of
DHPs and (hetero)aryl bromides were also explored. Benzothiophenes
proved to be robust partners with unstabilized secondary radicals.
Electron-poor furans were also successfully coupled in decent yield
with cyclohexyl DHP. Surprisingly, alkene-containing DHPs afforded
excellent yields with acyclic and cyclic systems. 3-Bromo-5-chloropyridine
was coupled with benzyl DHP in 42% yield, affording the chloride functional
handle for further derivatization.

Scheme 19 Aryl Bromide and
DHP Scope
The robust nature
of the transformation was demonstrated by using
a protected carbohydrate derivative. This particular example, in which
the product was isolated in 70% yield, demonstrates the complementarity
between the single electron protocol and processes based on traditional
organometallic species. In the latter, any metalation on the carbohydrate
core would lead to rapid β-elimination of the neighboring alkoxide.
Photoredox/Ni dual catalysis thus provides rapid entry to novel chemical
space. Finally, unprotected glycoside moieties were tolerated, albeit
a modest yield was achieved. Previous methods based on organometallic
nucleophiles would typically require protection of the free hydroxyl
groups before coupling, followed by a global deprotection.

C–H
Arylation
Alkyltrifluoroborates, -silicates,
and -DHPs exhibit many desirable traits as partners in photoredox/Ni
dual catalysis, but the coupling of prefunctionalized, redox-active
substrates is inherently limited by atom, step, and redox economy.
For example, one must adjust the redox profile of unreactive species
(e.g., boronic acids, silanes, or aldehydes) into their active forms,
adding mass and molecular complexity that is ultimately lost upon
coupling. In principle, direct functionalization of a C(sp3)–H bond would provide optimal atom economy while reducing
step and redox inefficiency en route to C(sp3)–C(sp2) coupling products.41 Efforts
toward general approaches to Ni-catalyzed C(sp3)–H
arylation in the literature are limited by extreme conditions (greater
than 100 °C), peroxide reagents/oxidants that often lead to unwanted
byproducts, and the need for directing groups.42 Given that photoredox catalysis is a powerful tool for
accessing reactive intermediates demonstrated by numerous synthetic
groups,43 we sought to apply photoredox/Ni
dual catalysis to the difficult challenge of effecting C(sp3)–H arylation at room temperature.44

In the context of photoredox catalysis, C(sp3)–H
functionalization has been achieved through oxidation of N,N-dialkylanilines4,45 because the
formation of a nitrogen-centered radical cation significantly weakens
the adjacent C(sp3)–H bond. Our group envisioned
targeting redox-inactive C(sp3)–H
bonds, from which we hoped to form alkyl radicals that could participate
in dual catalytic systems. For a C–H bond to replace a stoichiometric,
redox-active radical precursor within the established mechanism, an
additive would need to serve two roles: (1) act as a single-electron
reductant of the excited-state photocatalyst and (2) generate an alkyl
radical. To accomplish this, we sought a mediator that could serve
as an electron donor as well as facilitate radical generation via
H atom transfer from C(sp3)–H bonds. Although our
group focused on diaryl ketones to facilitate direct arylation of
C(sp3)–H bonds, the MacMillan group identified quinuclidine
derivatives as highly efficient additives for a related transformation.46

On the basis of the well-established reactivity
of excited state
diaryl ketone diradicals, which form ketyl radicals upon hydrogen
atom abstraction (HAT) from both activated and unactivated C(sp3)–H bonds,47 we envisioned
a tricatalytic mechanism for net C–H arylation (Scheme 20). Early studies employing
THF as H atom donor and solvent with one equivalent of benzophenone
under standard coupling conditions afforded the desired product, albeit
in moderate conversion. Addition of Brønsted bases significantly
improved conversion, presumably by quenching the HBr byproduct. Additional
optimization provided adequate conditions and represented an unprecedented
example of directing group-free, Ni-catalyzed C(sp3)–H
arylation at room temperature. Control studies confirmed the necessity
for nickel catalyst, photocatalyst, and light, but we were surprised
to discover significant conversion to the desired product without the diaryl ketone HAT mediator. The ability of iridium
and nickel to cocatalyze C(sp3)–H arylation was
concurrently discovered by Doyle, who developed conditions to couple
aryl chlorides using higher loadings of a Ni(0) source and a stronger
phosphate base.48

Scheme 20 Tricatalytic Mechanistic
Proposal
Although control
studies demonstrated our initial mechanistic hypothesis
was not responsible for the observed reactivity, we opted to examine
the reaction scope, hoping that the limitations therein would provide
insight into the nature of the bond-activating species. Unfortunately,
the alkylation scope with respect to C(sp3)–H substrates
was narrow, requiring activated partners to be used as solvent. Ethereal
solvents, such as THF, 1,4-dioxane, DME, and Et2O, were
effective (Scheme 21). Arylation of C(sp3)–H bonds adjacent to nitrogen-
and sulfur-based heterocycles was also observed, with N-methylpyrrolidinone and tetrahydrothiophene undergoing
α-arylation. Furthermore, toluene was effectively coupled at
the benzylic position. Although the scope of the reaction with respect
to the C(sp3)–H is unquestionably specific, it is
also surprisingly effective given the stringent requirements for the
substrate-solvent to (1) donate an activated C(sp3)–H,
(2) effectively solvate the reaction mixture, and (3) be sufficiently
volatile for removal upon completion. Similar limitations were observed
by Doyle, though they reported three examples of direct C(sp3)–H coupling with 10 equiv of H atom donor in benzene, including
an appreciable reactivity of cyclohexane’s unactivated C(sp3)–H bonds.

Scheme 21 C(sp3)–H Partner Scope
Subsequently, THF was coupled
with a variety of aryl bromides under
the established conditions. Both electron-deficient and electron-rich
(hetero)aryl bromides were coupled successfully (Scheme 22). Although bromides bearing
homolytically weak C–H bonds were well-tolerated, protic functional
groups were detrimental. Notably, in the presence of difunctionalized
bromo- and chloroarenes, the conditions developed provided exclusive
alkylation of the bromide. Although the scope is limited, this transformation
represents an undirected, room-temperature coupling of C(sp3)–H and aryl bromides, underlining the advantages of photoredox/Ni
dual catalysis.

Scheme 22 Aryl Bromide Scope in Ni/Ir Cross-Coupling
Approaching reaction development
with an incomplete or inaccurate
mechanistic understanding greatly biases the steps that can be taken
to improve upon underlying limitations. Thus, mechanistic studies
were necessary to develop a better understanding of the unexpected
reactivity in the absence of a diaryl ketone. A representative transformation
was thus carried out in a 1:1 mixture of THF:d8-THF, and this reaction displayed a kinetic isotope effect
of 6:1, which is indicative of a thermodynamically neutral H atom
transfer49 rather than formal C–H
activation by a metal center. As a result of the observed KIE and
the need for activated C(sp3)–H bonds, we suspected
a bromine radical, which is capable of activating weak C(sp3)–H bonds, was generated under the photocatalytic conditions
(Scheme 23).

Scheme 23 KIE and
Energy-Transfer Experiments
We first speculated that the Ni(II) oxidative addition
intermediate
could be oxidized to a Ni(III) state by the iridium photocatalyst.
The C(sp3)–H activation steps would occur via (1)
homolysis of the Ni(III)–Br bond to generate a bromine radical,
(2) H atom transfer by the resulting bromine radical, and (3) alkyl
radical addition to Ni(II). To provide support for this hypothesis,
a series of photocatalysts were compared with higher oxidation potentials
than the iridium photocatalyst. We first confirmed that 1 led to product and that no product formed under visible light excitation
in the absence of photocatalyst. Next, to our surprise, no product
was observed using the highly oxidizing ruthenium and acridinium photocatalyst 3 and 5, respectively. This suggests that simple
oxidation of the Ni(II) complex by a photocatalyst may not be sufficient
to explain the observed C(sp3)–H arylation.

An alternative explanation is a triplet–triplet energy transfer
facilitated by photocatalyst 1, which has a higher triplet
energy than 3 and 5 based on a comparison
of their emission wavelengths (Scheme 23). To test this new hypothesis, the Ni(II)
complex was subjected to UV–B irradiation with emission wavelengths
between 290–315 nm. Indeed, as shown in entry 5, product was
observed. These results suggest that a Ni(II) excited state, which
forms in the absence of an oxidant, is sufficient to facilitate the
observed C(sp3)–H arylation. As a result, a mechanism
based upon energy transfer was favored.

We proposed that irradiation
with UV light could promote Ni to
a high-energy state that relaxes and undergoes intersystem crossing
to a Ni(II) triplet that eliminates a halide radical.50 Alternatively, the same Ni(II) excited state could be reached
through a photocatalytic process: (1) photocatalyst excitation by
visible light, (2) efficient intersystem crossing by the photocatalyst,
and (3) triplet–triplet energy sensitization of the Ni(II)
oxidative addition intermediate by a sufficiently high-energy photocatalyst
triplet state (Scheme 24). Importantly, in the energy transfer scenario, the operative Ni
excited state would be inaccessible in the presence of photocatalysts
with insufficiently energetic triplet states (such as those exhibited
by photocatalysts 3 and 5) or by irradiation
with inadequately energetic wavelengths of light (i.e., visible light).
Preliminary computational work shows that the formation of a formal
Ni(II) triplet state would elongate the Ni–Br bond and also
result in transfer of electron density from the Ni center to the ligand,
resulting in an excited-state species that may exhibit some similarities
to the formal Ni(III) intermediates that are commonly invoked in photoredox/Ni
cross-coupling.

Scheme 24 Jablonski Diagram of High-Energy Nickel Complex
Although we favor a mechanism
based on energy transfer, we are
admittedly unable to rule out the electron transfer-based mechanism
favored in concurrently published work by Doyle et al.51 It should be noted that the Doyle group has
shown that Ni(II) oxidative addition complexes have redox potentials
within 1a’s oxidation window and also display
Stern–Volmer quenching of the iridium photocatalyst. However,
Stern–Volmer quenching is insufficient to distinguish between
energy- and electron-transfer processes. Transient absorption spectroscopic
studies may be able to address this question51 and provide a stronger basis for further development. Importantly,
the mechanistic difference may strongly bias efforts in catalyst development
to improve the efficiency of these reactions. The prevailing focus
of photocatalyst development on redox potentials (SET) reflects the
more typical mode of activation in organic synthesis, but optimizing
for less commonly invoked energy transfer processes is largely underdeveloped.43 Recently, Weaver et al. studied the important
relationship between catalyst structure and cis/trans isomerization
of alkenes via energy transfer,52 but energy
transfer between metals is particularly challenging given the lack
of systems thought to operate by this mechanism and the difficulty
in studying catalytic intermediates that may be transient in nature.53

The proposed mechanism is thus depicted
in Scheme 25. Ni(0) 9 undergoes oxidative
addition with the aryl bromide followed by energy transfer (EnT) to
form an excited Ni(II) complex 10. We surmise that complex 10 can facilitate C–H abstraction from THF to form
intermediate 11, which can then undergo reductive elimination
to form the corresponding product. It should be noted that the transformation
from 10 to 11 is currently under investigation
using computational methods. Currently, the KIE studies suggest the
formation of bromine radical followed by a HAT process to form the
alkyl radical. Alternatively, there is the possibility of a concerted
step involving a four-membered transition state structure that is
also consistent with experimental data.

Scheme 25 Current Mechanistic
Proposal
Although functionalizing
C(sp3)–H bonds has historically
been a challenging transformation, these preliminary results may provide
a platform for further studies involving less-reactive C–H
bonds. Toward this end, the ability to channel visible light energy
selectively into synthetically useful C(sp3)–H activation
reactions through elementary radical H atom transfer steps has already
enabled a recent, rapid growth in methods for functionalization of
unactivated C–H bonds at room temperature.54

PHOTOREDOX PROCESSES
Seeing the
value of catalytic radical generation
in various cross-coupling reactions, we next sought to apply the same
principle to other transformations wherein the stoichiometric generation
of radicals provided suboptimal outcomes. Protocols developed within
these previous paradigms typically resulted in the use of huge excesses
of radical precursors and radical-generating reagents, which we were
able to avoid using photoredox-generated radicals.

Formation of Secondary
Amines
The expansion of the
chemical toolbox to include mild, bench-stable radical precursors
as alkylating reagents under photoredox conditions was considered
an attractive alternative to organometallics utilized in other C–C
bond-forming reactions. The reaction of Grignard and organolithium
reagents with C=O and C=N electrophiles has extensive
value, but the instability and functional group intolerance of these
highly reactive organometallics has always framed their use.55 To address this issue, we imagined that nucleophilic
alkyl radicals generated via photoredox catalysis could serve as mild
alkylating agents to facilitate Grignard-type additions to electrophilic
imines.56 Previously reported radical-based
approaches in which the radicals were generated stoichiometrically relied on conditions that were far from ideal [e.g., large excesses
of flammable Et3B/O2 initiators, radical precursors
(typically alkyl iodides), and reductants such as tin reagents or
Zn], owing to the byproducts formed upon generation of the radicals.

Further, although the addition of α-heteroatom-stabilized
radicals to imines has been reported, we recognized that silicate
radical precursors would provide access to a broader range of alkyl
radicals. A variety of nitrogen-substituted imines were transformed
into the corresponding α-aryl-α-alkyl secondary amines
utilizing alkyl radicals generated from bis(catecholato)silicates.
The transformation occurred readily under mild, redox neutral conditions
without additives. The relatively low oxidation potentials of the
silicate radical precursors facilitated the use of the organic photocatalyst
4CzIPN instead of Ru or Ir species, rendering the entire process metal-free.
A variety of primary and secondary alkyl radicals bearing synthetically
useful functional groups were readily intercepted by electronically
varied α-(hetero)aryl imines under the optimized reaction conditions
(Scheme 26).

Scheme 26 Alkylation
of Diverse Imines
Allylation, Alkenylation, and Cyanation
We also explored
the incorporation of readily available organophotocatalysts in allylation
and alkenylation reactions.57 Alkenyl sulfones
were employed as electrophilic reagents to effect the transition metal-free
alkenylation and allylation of Boc-protected potassium α-aminomethyltrifluoroborates.
The inexpensive sodium salt of the organic photocatalyst Eosin Y (Ered = +0.83 V vs SCE) was found to be a suitable
oxidant for potassium α-pyrrolidinyltrifluoroborate (Ered = +0.78 V vs SCE) under the reaction conditions
developed. Conversely, the related cesium carboxylate (Ered = +0.95 V vs SCE) required the use of an iridium photocatalyst.
Exploring the scope of the alkenyl sulfones revealed that stabilization
of the radical intermediates following radical addition was required.
Various electron-neutral, electron-withdrawing, and electron-donating
substituents on the aryl ring were well-tolerated under the reaction
conditions (Scheme 27). Protected homoallylic amines bearing styrene and acrylate groups
were also generated from the corresponding allylic sulfones, although
lower yields were observed.

Scheme 27 Alkenylation and Allylation of Pyrrolidinyltrifluoroborate
A wide range of primary and
secondary alkyltrifluoroborates was
also incorporated into an organic photocatalyst-mediated deboronative
cyanation reaction using the highly oxidizing MesAcr+ photocatalyst
and tosyl cyanide (TsCN) as a radical trap (Scheme 28). Classically, alkyl nitriles are synthesized
via SN2 displacement of halides with nucleophilic cyanide
sources.58 As a result, the formation of
primary nitriles is favored over secondary and tertiary analogues.
On the basis of the coupling of alkyltrifluoroborates with alkenyl
and allylic sulfones, we sought to capture alkyl radicals (generated
from photoinduced oxidation of alkyltrifluoroborates) with TsCN. By
proceeding through radical intermediates, we anticipated that regiospecific
cyanation should occur with mechanistic preference for less electrophilic
carbon centers. The optimized reaction conditions provided access
to primary and secondary as well as α-alkoxy-, γ-, β-,
and α-amino alkyl nitriles under extremely mild reaction conditions.
Notably, cyanation of an α-alkoxy alkyltrifluoroborate afforded
a protected cyanohydrin, which can be difficult to synthesize by other
methods given the reversibility of cyanohydrin formation.59 A plausible mechanism is presented in Scheme 28. A visible-light-excited
organic catalyst oxidizes the potassium alkyltrifluoroborate via a
single-electron oxidation to provide an alkyl radical. The resulting
radical then forms a new C–C bond in the presence of a suitable
sulfonyl coupling partner while expelling a sulfonyl radical. The
resultant sulfonyl radical is then reduced by one electron to close
the catalytic cycle.60

Scheme 28 Mild Cyanation of
Alkyltrifluoroborates
Conclusions and Future Outlook
Since establishing photoredox/Ni
dual catalysis in 2014, our group
has successfully modified both radical precursors and electrophiles
in further efforts to expand access to underexplored chemical space.
Beyond aryl bromides, our group has demonstrated triflates, tosyl
cyanide, imines, acid chlorides, and sulfones as feasible “electrophilic”
partners in both dual catalytic and metal-free manifolds. Additionally,
since the initial demonstration of silicates as complementary radical
precursors, a wider range of functionally rich alkyl radicals have
been successfully cross-coupled. Although alkyltrifluoroborates and
-silicates are fantastic reagents, step and atom economy is poor.
Furthermore, the photoredox/Ni dual catalytic mechanism has led to
a redefinition of alkyl coupling partners from traditional organometallic nucleophiles to redox-active radical precursors. Therefore, our group has searched for routes to access radical
precursors from readily available functional groups. As demonstrated
with DHPs (derived from aldehydes), feedstock functional groups hold
great potential as latent radicals with wide commercial availability.
Although DHPs are often more easily accessed than alkyltrifluoroborates
and -silicates, there is room for improvement in atom economy. In
related work, we uncovered an energy-transfer pathway targeting activated
C(sp3)–H bonds, which may inspire further related
reaction design.

Finally, these studies bear witness to the
value of generating
highly reactive radical intermediates catalytically, in a tightly
orchestrated, controlled manner to avoid deleterious side-reactions
and lead to processes that are more efficacious and sustainable than
those in which the radicals are created en mass by stoichiometric
protocols.
