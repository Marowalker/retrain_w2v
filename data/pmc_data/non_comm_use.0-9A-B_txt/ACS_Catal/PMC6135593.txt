Periodic
density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried
out to investigate the mechanism of methane oxidation with H2O2 over the defined Fe sites in Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite. The
initial Fe site is modeled as a [(H2O)2–Fe(III)–(μO)2–Fe(III)–(H2O)2]2+ extraframework cluster deposited in the zeolite pore and charge-compensated
by two anionic lattice sites. The activation of this cluster with
H2O2 gives rise to the formation of a variety
of Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(IV)-oxo complexes potentially reactive toward
methane dissociation. These sites are all able to promote the first
C–H bond cleavage in methane by following three possible reaction
mechanisms: namely, (a) heterolytic and (b) homolytic methane dissociation
as well as (c) Fenton-type reaction involving free OH radicals as
the catalytic species. The C–H activation step is followed
by formation of MeOH and MeOOH and regeneration of the active site.
The Fenton-type path is found to proceed with the lowest activation
barrier. Although the barriers for the alternative heterolytic and
homolytic pathways are found to be somewhat higher, they are still
quite favorable and are expected to be feasible under reaction conditions,
resulting ultimately in MeOH and MeOOH products. H2O2 oxidant competes with CH4 substrate for the same
sites. Since the oxidation of H2O2 to O2 and two [H+] is energetically more favorable than
the C–H oxofunctionalization, the overall efficiency of the
latter target process remains low.

1 Introduction
The conversion of methane to methanol is considered one of the
greatest challenges in catalysis today.1−3 Currently, a two-step
process via synthesis gas is used in industry. For economic reasons,
a one-pot production of methanol at near-ambient conditions is desirable.4,5 The main challenge of this reaction is the targeted dissociation
of the first C–H bond followed by formation of methanol, which
is not the thermodynamically most stable oxidation product. It is
easily converted further to other oxygenated hydrocarbons and carbon
oxides. In the past hundred years, a tremendous amount of experimental
and theoretical work on this process has been conducted.3,6−8 Although the field had witnessed significant achievements,
no direct methane oxofunctionalization process suitable for industrial
implementation has been delivered so far.

The simplest alternative
to the current two-step process is the
thermal oxidation of methane.9 Relatively
high yields of oxygenated products can be achieved: 60% methanol selectivity
at 12–13% methane conversion has been reported. Interestingly,
it was proposed that the metal wall of the actual reactor is key to
the low selectivity of the process, as it provides the catalytic sites
for the overoxidation of methanol to carbon oxides. Although the methanol
yields achieved by the thermal oxidation are quite impressive, it
was concluded that no further improvement of the process could be
delivered by optimization of operational conditions. The introduction
of a catalyst capable of shifting selectivity away from the overoxidation
path is necessary.5

Among the lower-temperature
catalytic paths for methane oxofunctionalization,
the catalytic system of Periana et al.10,11 stands out
as the most successful. It utilizes (bpym)Pt(II)Cl2 homogeneous
catalyst in concentrated sulfuric acid solvent at 200 °C, providing
up to 81% selectivity to a methyl sulfate oxofunctionalization product
at about 90% methane conversion. Despite its outstanding performance,
this system is industrially not applicable due to the harsh reaction
conditions and relatively low productivity.

In the past two
decades, transition and nontransition metal clusters,
such as Co, Fe, Cu, or Zn deposited in zeolites,12−20 came to the forefront of catalytic oxidation research. Mainly three
oxidizing agents were applied in combination with these catalysts:
(1) O2,12,14 (2) N2O18,19 in gas–solid-phase reactions, and (3) H2O216,17 in liquid–gas-phase reactions. The
greatest problem with gas–solid-phase reactions is that they
are semicatalytic. Catalyst oxidation, methane activation, and methanol
formation by hydrolysis of the strongly adsorbed methoxo species are
carried out in separate process stages. Additionally, the product
is obtained as a very low-concentration solution, which entails further
costs of separation. Recently, promising improvements were achieved
by the cofeeding of water in the reaction mixture.21 An alternative solution is the liquid-phase reaction, where
methane oxidation with liquid oxidants can be carried out in a single
catalytic process. Among different systems considered, promising results
were demonstrated by Hutchings and Hammond and their co-workers16,17,22−24, who investigated
the oxidation of methane to methanol over an iron-modified (Fe/ZSM-5)
zeolite-based catalyst with H2O2 as the oxidant.

Understanding the nature of the catalytic species and reaction
mechanism is key to rational optimization and improvement of heterogeneous
catalyst. Extraframework clusters present in metal-exchanged zeolites
can have different chemical composition and be located at different
positions. Distinct configurations and clusters might have different
catalytic activity and contribute differently to the overall selectivity
of the catalytic process.25−30 That is why a great deal of research has so far been devoted to
discriminating the active site from the spectator species and identifying
the reaction mechanism in zeolite catalysis. Panov and co-workers18,19 have proposed that when N2O is used as the oxidant, the
catalytic species providing a high reactivity of Fe/ZSM-5 toward C–H
activation is Fe(IV)=O, denoted as the α-oxygen. Later
studies by Schoonheydt, Sels, Solomon, and co-workers31,32 provided additional experimental evidence to this assignment and
identified such mononuclear species as the active site for gas-phase
methane oxofunctionalization.

These experimental findings are
in line with earlier computational
studies on the nature of catalytic sites for benzene oxidation with
N2O by Fe/ZSM-5.33 Li et al.34 carried out a comprehensive study on the stability
and reactivity of different Fe-containing species in ZSM-5 zeolite.
It was found that isolated Fe2+ species capable of forming
the reactive α-oxygen sites can only be formed within a small
fraction of cationic sites featuring a symmetric arrangement of lattice
Al sites. Most of the extraframework positions were proposed to be
occupied by the alternative oxygen-bridged iron clusters. Importantly,
only the isolated sites were shown to contribute to the catalytic
benzene oxidation process, as C–H activation over the other
species yields highly stable surface structures that effectively deactivate
the respective Fe site.

Very recently, Nørskov and co-workers35 reported a computational analysis of a wide
range of materials for
their ability to active C–H bonds in methane via a homolytic
reaction mechanism (Scheme 1, pathway 2). In another example, researchers found that,
in a [Cu3O3]2+ cluster deposited
in the zeolite framework, the O atom with higher spin density is more
reactive.36 In other cases, the authors
compared clusters containing different metal ions. One study concluded
that Ni is the best-performing among Cu, Zn, and Ni in homogeneous
catalysts;37 another study found that Cu
is the best among Ni, Co, Fe, Ag, and Au when these metals are deposited
in a ZSM-5 zeolite framework.38

Scheme 1 Potential
Mechanistic Pathways for C–H Bond Cleavage: (1)
Heterolytic, (2) Homolytic, and (3) Fenton-type Activation Investigated
in This Paper
Two principal C–H
activation mechanisms providing a path
toward selective methane activation are usually distinguished: (1)
heterolytic and (2) homolytic reaction mechanisms (Scheme 1).39,40 In the former case, the C–H bond is activated over an acid–base
pair to form an anionic alkyl group stabilized by the acid (often
a metal cation) and a proton is accepted by the base part of the active
site. Note that the heterolytic C–H cleavage is not accompanied
by any redox processes within the active site. The actual oxidation
of the alkyl moiety should then take place in subsequent steps of
the overall catalytic process. In the homolytic mechanism, the C–H
bond breaks with the formation of two radical species: the alkyl radical
and a formally H radical. The H radical represents a transient species
that is readily accepted by the basic moiety of the active site, which
is at the same time reduced with 1 e–. The subsequent
rebound of the CH3 radical completes the two-electron reduction
process and yields the oxidized organic product or surface-bound intermediate.
Given the fact that homolytic C–H activation commonly yield
a free alkyl radical while the energy losses due to cleavage of a
strong C–H bond come predominantly from single-electron reduction
of the active complex accompanied by its protonation, the basicity
of the proton-accepting site (B) (that is, basically, the strength
of the resulting B–H bond) has been recognized as one of the
critical parameters defining the overall reactivity of a catalyst
toward homolytic C–H activation.35,41 The direct
relationships between this parameter and the computed barriers for
C-H activation have been demonstrated in recent study by Nørskov
and co-workers42 for a wide class of potential
heterogeneous catalysts.

In the chemistry of iron (see Plietker),43 the preference for a particular C–H activation
mechanism
is usually defined by the oxidation state of the Fe site, its coordination
environment, and the nature of the ligands.39 Heterolytic C–H cleavage (Scheme 1, pathway 1) is commonly observed over the
lower-valent Fe sites (e.g., 3+ and 2+) conjugated with a strong base
site. The homolytic C–H dissociation (Scheme 1, pathway 2) is more typical for higher-valent
Fe sites that feature more covalent-type bonding and facilitate the
oxidative activation of the substrate coupled with the reduction of
Fe. In addition to these two very generic reaction channels, scientists
distinguish one more mechanism specific to Fe chemistry: that is,
the Fenton-type mechanism of C–H activation (Scheme 1, pathway 3). Although formally
this mechanism can be regarded as a subtype of the homolytic C–H
bond dissociation (pathway 2), it is commonly considered separately
in view of the secondary role the Fe site plays in it. In Fenton chemistry,
iron ions initiate the radical oxidation paths by producing free OH
radical species, which activate C–H bonds.44,45 In the context of selective methane oxofunctionalization, Fenton-type
reactions have been explored in works by Shulpin and co-workers46−48 who demonstrated that, in the presence of Fe(II) ions, methane can
be oxidized with H2O2 and O2 to produce
MeOOH as the main product. Similar chemistry has recently been proposed
by Hutchings and co-workers49 to govern
methane oxidation by Pd nanoparticles.

In many cases, only one
type of activation is investigated. For
example, the structure–activity relationship derived by Nørskov
and co-workers35 is valid only under the
assumption of homolytic C–H bond activation. However, there
are density functional theory (DFT) studies that propose heterolytic
methane dissociation over Cu and Fe clusters deposited in zeolites.50−52 In a complex system such as transition-metal-exchanged zeolites,
different clusters can be found,34 which
might promote diverse types of C–H bond activation. In our
work, we aim to investigate how different Fe clusters influence the
type and energetics of C–H bond cleavage. For this, we analyzed
this reaction step over numerous clusters created from binuclear Fe(III)-oxo
with H2O2 based on the catalytic system of Hutchings
and co-workers.16 Mostly theoretical work
focuses on the rate-determining C–H bond activation step, but
here we also present the whole catalytic cycle, including formation
of the active site, C–H bond activation, and product formation
followed by regeneration of the initial site. All three previously
introduced potential reaction mechanisms were considered for methane
activation. Comprehensive description of the reaction network provides
us with atomic-level insights into this immensely complicated heterogeneous
catalytic process.

2 Model and Simulation Details
The spin-polarized periodic DFT calculations were carried out with
the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).53−56 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) exchange–correlation functional57,58 was used together with a plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy
of 450 eV and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method.59,60 To account for the van der Waals interactions, the semiempirical
Grimme’s dispersion correction with Becke–Jonson damping
[DFT-D3(BJ)] method61 was used. A Gaussian
smearing of the population of partial occupancies with a width of
0.05 eV was used during iterative diagonalization of the Kohn–Sham
Hamiltonian. Brillouin zone sampling was restricted to the Γ
point.62 Convergence was assumed to be
reached when the force on each atom was below 0.04 eV·Å–1.

To locate transition states, the nudged elastic
band method (NEB)63 was applied. The maximum
energy geometry along
the reaction path generated by the NEB method was further optimized
by use of a quasi-Newton algorithm. In this procedure, only the extraframework
atoms, and relevant framework atoms were relaxed. Vibrational frequencies
were calculated by the finite difference method (0.02 Å atomic
displacements) as implemented in VASP. Transition state showed a single
imaginary frequency corresponding to the reaction path.

As an
initial active-site model, a binuclear Fe cluster coordinated
by framework oxygen atoms and extraframework μ-oxo and water
molecules at its first coordination shell with a total coordination
number of 6 for each iron center (octahedral environment), [(H2O)2–Fe(III)–(μO)2–Fe(III)–(H2O)2]2+, is taken into consideration. The cluster is placed over the eight-membered
ring of the zeolite. Two Si atoms of the ring are substituted with
Al in the T7 and T12 sites (Figure 1). The unit cell lattice parameters are optimized and
are fixed throughout the calculations (a = 20.1, b = 19.8, c = 13.2, α = β =
γ = 90°). We based our assumption or the initial site on
the DFT study of Li et al.,34 which indicates
this cluster as the most stable one among mono-, bi-, and tetranuclear
species containing Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions in an oxidative aqueous
environment. This is in agreement with the experimental and computational
results of Hutchings and co-workers,16 who
concluded with high uncertainty an [(H2O)(HO)–Fe–(μOH)2–Fe–(OH)(H2O)]2+ cluster
as the representative species of their system. This cluster can be
obtained from the previously described one by two H+ transfers
from the H2O molecules to the bridging O atoms, which is
a very facile reaction, and does not change the stability of the cluster
significantly, as we demonstrate in our calculations.

Figure 1 Initial [(H2O)2–Fe(III)–(μO)2–Fe(III)–(H2O)2]2+ model placed in the ZSM5 zeolite
pore. The rest of the atoms in
the periodic unit cell are omitted from the picture for the sake of
visual clarity. Color code: Si, yellow; Al, purple; Fe, blue; O, red;
H, white.

The octahedral environment may
change during the course of the
reaction; for example, one or both Fe atoms decoordinate from one
of the framework O atoms. Due to the high number of structures, this
is not elaborated in the text. Interested readers are invited to look
at the files containing the geometry of each structure in Supporting Information.

All possible spin
states (S = 0–5) were
considered for the initial Fe cluster. DFT calculations point to the S = 3 state as the most stable one. However, in this state
one H2O molecule decoordinates from the Fe and forms a
H bond with another H2O molecule, thus providing an artificial
stabilization to the overall system. The release of H2O
is triggered by the change of spin state, which results in different
orbital energies, a change of ligand field, and therefore a change
in the preferred geometry of the Fe complex. A similar effect is observed
for the S = 4 state. The second most stable configuration
is the antiferromagnetically coupled S = 0 state
(broken symmetry singlet). Spin density analysis shows that the absolute
value of spin assigned to each atom is similar to those in the S = 5 state. As it was shown previously that antiferromagnetic
coupling does not significantly influence the reactivity in the case
of O-bridged Fe dimers,64 for the reactivity
analysis we focused on the ferromagnetically coupled high-spin electronic
configurations rather than the antiferromagnetically coupled S = 0 state. Extensive justification for this simplification
has been provided by Baerends and co-workers.65 The preferred high- spin state changes over the course of the reaction
with the oxidation state of the Fe cluster and the formation of radicals.

In this study, we base our mechanistic analysis on the discussion
of relative electronic energies only, while the entropic effects are
considered to have only a minor effect on the reaction profiles. This
conclusion is supported by a series of test calculations, with the
results summarized in Supporting Information.

Over the course of the reaction, H2O molecules
leave
the Fe sites and new H2O molecules are formed (e.g., upon
decomposition of H2O2) that are not connected
to the Fe atoms. These molecules form a hydrogen-bond network connecting
the O- and H-sites associated with the cluster and the zeolite lattice.
These networks can very easily rearrange upon methane adsorption and/or
transformation without affecting the electronic properties of the
reactive Fe species but influencing the overall energy of the system.
As a result, we observed that the barrier heights and reaction energies
for elementary steps can be quite substantially affected by the positions
of these uncoordinated H2O [E(H-bond in
water) = ∼20 kJ/mol]. Extensive analysis of the different isomeric
structures involved in similar reaction steps shows that this is an
artifact of the model. In the actual aqueous medium, these effects
would have been counterbalanced by the presence of bulk H2O molecules. However, the comprehensive sampling required for such
an extensive model is in conflict with the goals of the present study.
Therefore, we neglected the respective effects and always removed
noncoordinated physically adsorbed H2O molecules from the
unit cell after their formation. The resulting desorption energy of
H2O molecules is not discussed in this article, but it
is shown in the reaction energy diagrams (e.g., reaction step 2×H2O/5 → 5 in Figure 8).

The numbering of structures
in the paper is not presented in sequential
order but follows individual reaction paths from the beginning to
the formation of CH3OH or CH3OOH (as summarized
in Figures S1 and S2). Conformational isomers
and CH4 adsorbed in different positions of the same active
site are marked with v after structure number. H2O in front of the structure number indicates an uncoordinated
H2O molecule, which will be removed in a later step of
the reaction.

3 Results
and Discussion
A schematic representation of the favorable
reaction mechanisms
identified in our study is shown in Figure 2. Detailed structures can be found in Figures S1 and S2. The active Fe(III) and Fe(IV)
sites are formed by adsorption and dissociation of H2O2. Reorganization of the H ions results in different active
sites. Our calculations show that Fe(III) species catalyze heterolytic
and Fenton-type activation, while Fe(IV) species facilitate homolytic
activation of methane. The Fe clusters are grouped on the basis of
average formal oxidation state. For example, if one Fe atom is formally
+2 while the other is in +4 oxidation state, the average is +3 and
the cluster is considered an Fe(III) cluster. The structures of all
clusters can be found in Figures S1 and S2.

steps underlying the oxidation of methane with H2O2 over Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite. Detailed descriptions of the structures
can be found in Supporting Information.

From Fe(III) species, methanol
can be formed via combination of
the methyl group and an OH group before or after oxidation of the
cluster by the peroxo ligand. In the cases of homolytic and Fenton-type
mechanisms, a methyl radical is formed, which can further transform
to CH3OH via a rebound mechanism or to CH3OOH
via reaction with O2 (inevitably formed by a parallel H2O2 decomposition process) and abstraction of a
H atom from the active site. Fe(IV) sites are the active species for
both homolytic dissociation of methane and decomposition of H2O2 to O2 and [H+] ions. In
the following sections, we provide detailed descriptions of each reaction
step.

3.1 Active-Site Formation
The first step
of the reaction is formation of the active site. All investigated
pathways (Figure 3)
start with adsorption of H2O2 in the zeolite
pore (H2O2/1) and its subsequent
coordination to the active site, where it substitutes one H2O molecule (2). These steps are exothermic by −44
kJ/mol. The conformational isomers 2v and 2vv, shown in Figure 3, are formed by rotation of the noncoordinated H2O molecule
and H2O2. The difference in energy between these
structures is an artifact of the model, resulting from the rearrangement
of H bonds as described in the Model and Simulation
Details section. This structural rearrangement is necessary
to adequately probe alternative reaction pathways for the subsequent
steps involving the H2O molecule as a proton mediator.
From this stage, two alternative reaction channels can be distinguished
that result in an active site: namely, (1) direct oxidation of both
Fe(III) centers to Fe(IV), via homolytic cleavage of the peroxide
moiety, and (2) deprotonation of H2O2 to form
an Fe-bound peroxo ligand, leaving the formal oxidation state of the
iron ions unchanged.

Figure 3 Potential reaction pathways for active-site formation
via reaction
of the Fe cluster with H2O2 and schematic representations
of key intermediates.

The first path proceeds with a barrier of only 56 kJ/mol
and yields
a transient OH radical (14) that readily subtracts a
H atom from a neighboring coordinated H2O (E# = 10 kJ/mol), resulting in 2×H2O/15. The isomerization of this species by proton reshuffling
gives 2×H2O/22 (ΔE = −3 kJ/mol) and 2×H2O/26 (ΔE = −73 kJ/mol). Such a water-assisted H transfer
is a very facile reaction that, in the case of the 2×H2O/15 → 2×H2O/22 step,
shows a barrier of 1 kJ/mol. Since we expect the activation barrier
for similar H-bonding rearrangements to be on the same order of magnitude,
the transition states were not located in other cases. This type of
reaction for ferryl ion formation was considered earlier by Baerends
and co-workers.68,69 An alternative path of 2×H2O/15 → 2×H2O/16 leads to the cleavage of one Fe-μO bond (ΔE = −33 kJ/mol). The diamond shape of the Fe-oxo cluster transforms
to a near-linear Fe–O–Fe species and a terminal O is
formed. Transition-state energy was found to be low for this type
of reaction, as described in the next paragraph for the reaction 3 → H2O/4.

The second
path starts with deprotonation of H2O2 by the
bridging O site to form a bridging OH group and a
terminal OOH ligand (3). The noncoordinating H2O molecule facilitates this reaction via a proton shuttling mechanism.
Next, the Fe−μOH bond breaks with an activation barrier
of only 16 kJ/mol to form an activated intermediate H2O/4, which is a near-linear Fe–O–Fe cluster with
a terminal OH ligand. This reaction is similar to the previously described
2×H2O/15 → 2×H2O/16 transformation. The activation barrier of other
Fe−μO bond cleavage reactions is expected to be in the
same range as other similar reactions, and it is significantly lower
than that of the rate-determining step; therefore, the activation
barriers of similar steps were not calculated for other cases.

In the next reaction step, H2O is decoordinated from
the Fe center. This is necessary because, during the heterolytic dissociation,
formation of an Fe–C bond occurs. Since the complex is originally
in octahedral coordination, this would not be possible without the
removal of one ligand. We decided to decouple H2O decoordination
from CH4 activation because otherwise the energy change
resulting from forming H bonds and Fe–O bond breaking would
artificially be included in the reaction and the transition-state
energies of C–H bond dissociation. In the reaction H2O/4 → 2×H2O/5 (ΔE = 9 kJ/mol), one H2O molecule leaves the Fe
atom. Removal of one H2O molecule from 2×H2O/5 results in H2O/5 (shown
in Figure 3), and by
removal of the second uncoordinated H2O molecule, 5 is obtained. In this case the Fe atom where the H2O was removed from has only five ligands. This will be the Fe atom
that will form the Fe–C bond. We are going to focus on this
Fe atom further in this paragraph. The removal of two H2O molecules, one coordinated and one uncoordinated, from 3 results in 11, which also has a five-coordinated Fe
atom. The difference between 11 and 5 is
that the Fe in 11 has one ligand that moves freely while
the other four, the framework, and the bridging O atoms are in fixed
positions. The Fe atom of 5 has two ligands that are
rather flexible: an H2O molecule and an OH ligand. This
difference leads to different structures. The Fe atom of 11 is in a square pyramid geometry, while the Fe of 5 is
closer to a trigonal bipyramidal geometry.

The first pathway
is thermodynamically more favorable than the
second, while the second has lower reaction barriers and thus is kinetically
more favorable. However, if we inspect the structures more closely,
we realize that by cleaving the peroxo bond of 3(→8) (ΔE = −53 kJ/mol; E# = 78 kJ/mol) and reshuffling the protons of 8, the structures of the first pathway can be obtained. This
indicates that the occurrence of all previously described structures
is feasible.

To decrease the influence of fluctuating H bonds,
the H2O molecules not coordinated to the Fe were removed
(vide supra).
This way the structures shown in Figure 3—4, 5, 11, 16, 22, and 26—were
obtained. These are the active sites applied in the subsequent C–H
bond activation steps. After removal of the extra water molecules,
the difference in energy between 15, 16, 22, and 26 decreases from 127 to 23 kJ/mol. Their
order of stability also changes: 16 becomes the most
stable species among them. This energy difference is rather small.
In the next section, we consider the active
site and the gas-phase methane for all reactions as reference points
to enable direct assessment of their reactivity.

3.2 C–H Bond Activation
The next
step of the reaction is the C–H bond cleavage of methane. The
previously described Fe(III) and Fe(IV) complexes were selected to
act as active sites in the reaction. As can be seen in Figure 2, Fe(III) complexes catalyze
the heterolytic and Fenton-type reactions while Fe(IV) complexes promote
the homolytic oxidation of methane. Figure 4 shows a sample transition state for each
case. The isosurface represents the spin density. Figure 4 A is a representative of the
heterolytic dissociation (5 → 9).
The bridging O subtracts H from CH4, and the CH3 ligand is already connected to Fe in the transition state, which
means that the Fe orbitals participate in the reaction. The lack of
spin density around C indicates that there are no unpaired electrons
on the C orbitals, and this is indeed a heterolytic dissociation. Figure 4 B shows the transition
state of reaction 26 → 27, a homolytic
C–H bond dissociation. In this case the terminal O accepts
the H atom and CH3 radical is formed. The C–H bond
distance is smaller than the H–O bond distance, implying a
late transition state. This is typical for the terminal O; however,
in other type of O atoms (bridging O or OH ligand) this is not necessarily
the situation. The spin density isosurface shows that C has more α-
than β-electrons, indicative of a radical reaction. Figure 4C shows the transition
state of a Fenton-type C–H bond dissociation (2 → 13). Spin density accumulates around the forming
OH radical, which cleaves the C–H bond. This is also a radical
reaction.

the spin density. Color coding: Al, purple; Fe, blue; O, red; C, black;

the unit cell of ZSM-5 zeolite, the Fe cluster, and the reactants.

In the following subsections we
present the detailed cases of each
type of CH4 activation.

3.2.1 Heterolytic
Activation
The reaction
energy diagram of heterolytic activation is shown in Figure 5. The reference point is the
active site and gas-phase methane. At first methane is adsorbed in
the zeolite pore, which is followed by heterolytic dissociation of
the first C–H bond of CH4 and formation of a CH3 group and an OH ligand or H2O. For this reaction
to occur, Fe needs to have an empty coordination site to accommodate
the CH3 group. Hence one H2O ligand was decoordinated
from one of the Fe atoms during formation of the active site followed
by the removal of one or two physically adsorbed H2O molecules
as described in the previous section (2×H2O/4 → 5 and H2O/5; 3 → 11).

Figure 5 Reaction energy diagram
of heterolytic C–H bond cleavage
of methane. The reference point is the active site and gas-phase methane.
The first step is methane adsorption in the zeolite pore, followed
by heterolytic dissociation of the first C–H bond of methane
and the formation of an Fe–CH3 moiety and an OH
ligand or water, depending on the nature of the proton-accepting site.

The first possibility is the reaction
H2O/5 → 6 (dark blue).
It starts with CH4 adsorption in the zeolite pore. Since
the Fe site is not located
in the main channel, there is not enough space for the methane to
coordinate favorably to the active site. The confinement of the framework
and the cluster results in repulsive forces around the methane. This
entails a positive adsorption energy and a relatively high reaction
energy (99 kJ/mol) and reaction barrier (139 kJ/mol).

Reactions 5 → 9 (light blue) and 5 → 10 (orange) show the reaction over
the same cluster as H2O/5 but with one fewer
H2O molecule around the cluster. Methane is adsorbed at
a different position, resulting in a negative adsorption energy. The
difference between the two reactions is the activating O. In reaction 5 → 9, methane is activated by a bridging
O (ΔE = 49 kJ/mol, E# = 82 kJ/mol), while in reaction 5 → 10, methane is activated by the terminal OH group (ΔE = 40 kJ/mol, E# = 78 kJ/mol). Since
both the reaction barrier and energy are very similar, this indicates
that the type of O does not influence the reactivity significantly.

Next, we compare the performance of two active sites, 5 and 11. As described previously, these two structures
have an Fe atom with five ligands in different geometries. The comparison
of paths 5 → 9 and 11 → 12 shows that this difference in geometry
does not have an effect on the reaction barrier (91 vs 82 kJ/mol,
respectively); however, formation of the octahedral environment greatly
stabilizes 12 (reaction energy of 49 vs 1 kJ/mol).

It is interesting to take the adsorbed methane as the reference
point for our comparison. The qualitative picture for 5 → 9, 5 → 10, and 11 → 12 does not change remarkably.
However, reaction H2O/5 → 6 will have much lower reaction barrier and energy, so that it becomes
the most favorable path. When confinement plays a role, the adsorption
has to be taken into account.

As mentioned earlier, heterolytic
activation occurs on Fe(III)
sites. In Figure 5,
structure 28 is the result of homolytic dissociation
over H2O/5. The OH group of 5 accepts a H atom and a CH3 radical is formed. The reaction
energy is 85 kJ/mol higher compared to the formation of intermediate 6, where instead of CH3 radical a CH3 ligand is formed. This is most likely due to the fact that homolytic
dissociation entails the reduction of the Fe site, in this case to
the Fe(II) state, while there is no formal oxidation state change
for heterolytic dissociation.

3.2.2 Homolytic
Activation
The reaction
energy diagrams of homolytic C–H cleavage are shown in Figure 6. Methane is adsorbed
in the zeolite, followed by its homolytic dissociation and formation
of a CH3 radical and an OH ligand or H2O connected
to Fe. The formal oxidation state of Fe in the active cluster is +4,
which means that the high-spin state is 8/2.
During the reaction, one Fe is reduced to +3 while C is formally oxidized.
The highest possible spin state becomes 10/2 [Fe(III)–Fe(IV) and CH3 radical]; however, it
can happen that the CH3 radical is antiferromagnetically
coupled with the Fe cluster, and the more stable spin state remains 8/2 at the end of this reaction step. Figure 6 summarizes the results obtained
for the most stable configurations.

Figure 6 Reaction energy diagram of homolytic C–H
bond cleavage of
methane. The reference point is the active site and gas-phase methane.
The first step is methane adsorption in the zeolite pore, followed
by homolytic dissociation of the first C–H bond of methane
and formation of a methyl radical and an OH ligand or water. The same-colored
lines represent reaction pathways where the cluster and the H-accepting
oxygen are the same but the position of adsorbed methane is different.

In Figure 6 the
reactions are grouped on the basis of the type of O ligand that abstracts
the H from CH4: (A) terminal, (B) bridging, or (C) OH group.
The lowest reaction barriers over terminal O and OH are similar (for 22 → 27 and 16 → 21, E# = 64 and 80 kJ/mol, respectively);
however, the reaction barrier over the bridging O is relatively high
(E# = 139 kJ/mol). This is a result of
the position of the Fe cluster, which is not located in the main channel
but in a somewhat confined position. The bridging O is not easily
accessible. The same reaction modeled in a different position in the
main channel resulted in lower adsorption (−43 kJ/mol), reaction
barrier (69 kJ/mol), and reaction energies (48 kJ/mol), which are
comparable to the best values obtained for Fe=O and Fe–OH
(transition-state structure shown in Figure S3). In general, this means that Fe=O, Fe–OH, and Fe−μO–Fe
oxygens are all able to activate methane.

The same trend can
be observed here as in the case of the heterolytic
dissociation. The positive adsorption energy decreases the intrinsic
barriers and reaction energies (reference point is the active site
with adsorbed methane); however, compared to the original reference
point (gas-phase methane and zeolite), the reactions with positive
adsorption energy are less exothermic and have higher barriers. This
is emphasized by the same-color reaction pathways, which represent
routes where the activating O and the Fe cluster are the same but
the methane is adsorbed in a different position in the zeolite. An
example is the case of 16 → 19 and 16 → 19v (light blue in Figure 6 A). In the first case methane
adsorbs above the cluster with a positive adsorption energy, while
in the second case methane adsorbs in the main channel next to the
cluster and accesses the terminal O from there. In the first case
the intrinsic activation energy is a mere 65 kJ/mol, while in the
second case it is 118 kJ/mol; however, if we take the gas-phase methane
as reference, the second reaction becomes more favorable with a reaction
barrier of 71 kJ/mol (vs 94 kJ/mol).

3.2.3 Fenton-type
Activation
Fenton-type
activation, as described earlier, is a type of homolytic C–H
bond dissociation. The important distinction from the previously presented
homolytic dissociation is that the role of the transition metal catalyst
is to produce the active OH radicals. Here we present two possibilities
for this type of reaction, for which reaction energy diagrams shown
in Figure 7. The active
sites are 2 and 4, already introduced in
the previous section; 2 is
formed by coordination of H2O2 to Fe, while 4 is formed by deprotonation of 2 and consecutive
cleavage of the Fe−μOH group (Figure 3). In the transition states, the CH4 is effectively intact and an OH radical is formed. The reaction
can be viewed as a redox reaction, in which the O atoms of H2O2 oxidize C in methane and Fe of the active site. The
reaction yields CH3 radical, H2O molecule, and
Fe(IV)Fe(III) complex. The Fenton-type methane activation is a highly
favorable process (ΔE = −74 and −87
kJ/mol), proceeding with barriers of 25 and −5 kJ/mol (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Reaction energy diagram
of Fenton-type C–H bond cleavage
of methane. The reference point is the active site and gas-phase methane.
The first step is methane adsorption in the zeolite pore, followed
by homolytic dissociation of the peroxo bond, formation of OH radical,
and dissociation of the first C–H bond of methane, and then
formation of a methyl radical and water molecule in the same step.

The lowest activation energy and
thermodynamic favorability belongs
to the Fenton-type activation. In general, Fenton-type reaction is
undesired, because it is very difficult to control and this path is
thought to decrease the selectivity of the overall process. The lowest
reaction and activation energies of the heterolytic and homolytic
dissociation pathways are comparable, which implies that both mechanisms
are effectively possible, and all type of O ligands can potentially
act as H acceptors, providing a favorable reaction channel for CH4 activation.

3.3 Closing the Reaction Cycle
3.3.1 Methanol Formation after Heterolytic Methane
Activation
The heterolytic mechanism of C–H activation
is seldom considered for the selective oxidation process, because
the subsequent CH3OH formation would require a dual-site
reductive elimination process. Figure 8 shows the full catalytic
cycle through intermediates 10 and 9. It
starts with activation of the binuclear Fe(III) site by H2O2 to obtain the 2×H2O/5 active
site. The physically adsorbed water is then removed, as explained
in the Model and Simulation Details section.
This step results in a 148 kJ/mol energy loss of the model system.
This is an artificial increase in the overall energy; however, it
is necessary to show it here to keep the reference point constant
throughout the reaction energy diagram. The same is true for the reaction
step 2×H2O/22 → 22 in Figure 9. The
desorption step is followed by adsorption and heterolytic dissociation
of CH4. To form methanol, recombination of CH3 and an OH ligand is needed. This decreases the formal oxidation
state of Fe(III)Fe(III) by 2, resulting in an Fe(II)Fe(II) structure.
This is shown by the orange line in Figure 8, where 9 is transformed to 30 with a barrier of 35 kJ/mol and −96 kJ/mol reaction
energy. To regenerate the catalyst, dissociation of the peroxo bond
and rearrangement of H ions are needed. These steps are not calculated
here; previous calculations indicate that the peroxo bond dissociation
proceeds with a barrier of ∼40–70 kJ/mol, and the H
atom transfer is almost barrierless.

Figure 8 Reaction energy diagram of methane to
methanol formation, including
formation of the active site, heterolytic C–H bond activation,
formation of CH3OH, and active-site regeneration.

The other possibility is oxidation
of the cluster prior to formation
of MeOH. This route is indicated by a blue line in Figure 8. The activation barrier for
peroxo bond (10 → 31) cleavage is
44 kJ/mol. H atom transfer to form 32 provides a 58 kJ/mol
energy gain, which can be explained by the formation of an Fe(IV)Fe(IV)
cluster from a formally Fe(V)Fe(III) intermediate. In the next step,
MeOH is formed (33) with a barrier of 74 kJ/mol that
is needed to reduce the Fe atoms. After desorption of MeOH, rearrangement
of H atoms, and formation of a bridging O, regeneration of the initial
Fe(III)–oxo cluster takes place. As described earlier, all
these steps proceed with a low reaction barrier.

These data
suggest that there is no energetic preference in the
order of MeOH formation and oxidation of the Fe cluster defined.

3.3.2 Methanol Formation after Homolytic and Fenton-type
Activation
The structures obtained after both homolytic and
Fenton-type pathways are similar in nature: they contain a CH3 radical and an Fe(III)Fe(IV) cluster. Figure 9 shows the formation of methanol from 25, which
is the result of combining the CH3 radical with an OH group
of the Fe cluster. The reaction step requires 57 kJ/mol activation
energy, and it has a reaction energy of −195 kJ/mol. With the
substitution of methanol by one water molecule, we obtain the initial
structure 1.

formation, including
formation of the active site, homolytic C–H bond activation,
formation of CH3OH, and active-site regeneration.

3.3.3 Methyl
Hydroperoxide Formation and H2O2 Decomposition
If CH3 radicals
are present in the liquid phase, formation of MeOOH is also possible.
A potential pathway is illustrated in Figure 10. CH3OOH formation starts with 13, where a CH3 radical is formed via Fenton-type
homolytic dissociation of methane. The first step of the reaction
is adsorption of O2 in the zeolite. O2 is present
in water, and it is also formed during the side reaction of H2O2 decomposition to H2O and O2. O2 and CH3 radical favorably combine to form
an MeOO radical (34) with an energy gain of −201
kJ/mol. In the next step, there is H transfer between the Fe–OH
and Fe–OH2 ligands (35) for the H atoms
to get into more favorable position for the water-assisted H transfer
to MeOO to yield MeOOH (CH3OOH + 2×H2O/36). As expected, this reaction has an activation barrier
of only a few kilojoules per mole and is thermodynamically neutral.
Compared to MeOH, the formation of MeOOH is thermodynamically similar:
ΔE(O2/13 → CH3OOH + 2×H2O/36) = −202 kJ/mol vs ΔE(25 → 29) = −195 kJ/mol. The limiting factor
is the O2 concentration in solution compared to the Fe–OH
groups or framework O atoms close to the sites of formation of CH3 radicals.

Figure 10 Reaction energy diagram of methane to CH3OOH
formation,
including formation of the active site, Fenton-type C–H bond
activation, formation of CH3OOH, and active-site regeneration
by H2O2 decomposition to O2.

To regenerate the initial site,
complex 36 needs to
be reduced. There are two reducing agents in the system: CH4 and H2O2. This means that the active site
might cleave a second C–H bond or oxidize H2O2 to two [H+] ions and an O2 molecule.
The latter option is illustrated in Figure 10. Starting from CH3OOH + 2×H2O/36, MeOOH and two uncoordinated H2O molecules are desorbed, and H2O2 is adsorbed.
The first step is abstraction of one H atom from the H2O2 molecule and formation of an OOH radical (37). The second H atom is then abstracted after the rearrangement of
the OOH radical, which comes with −39 kJ/mol energy gain due
to the formation of a H-bonding interaction (37v). The
reaction yields the initial site (O2/1). The total reaction energy of O2 formation from
H2O2 is −52 kJ/mol, and the activation
barrier of both H atom abstractions is less than 10 kJ/mol.

Both H2O2 →O2 + 2[H+] and CH4 → CH3 + [H] reactions
occur on the same Fe(IV)–oxo species. This means that H2O2 and CH4 are competing for the same
sites. Since the activation barrier of H2O2 oxidation
is significantly lower than the barrier of C–H bond dissociation,
and usually H2O2 concentration is significantly
higher than that of methane, the dissociation of H2O2 will be favored over methane. This renders the usage of H2O2 impractical for methane activation in combination
with high-valent Fe–oxo catalysts.

The total reaction
energies of methanol and methyl hydroperoxide
formation in Figures 8–10 are not directly comparable, due
to removal of the physically adsorbed H2O molecules in Figures 8 and 9 and the adsorption of O2 in Figure 10. We can, however, make an
estimation, for example, from Figure 9 by subtracting the desorption energy of the previously
removed H2O molecules (ΔE = 103
kJ/mol) and adding the adsorption energy of O2 (ΔE = −20 kJ/mol). This gives ΔE(1 → 2×H2O + O2/29) ≈ −233 – 123 = −336 kJ/mol,
which is comparable to the reaction energy for the alternative reaction
channel ΔE(1 → CH3OOH + 2×H2O/36) = −353 kJ/mol.
However, the calculations indicate that the formation of MeOOH is
kinetically more favorable than the formation of MeOH (following Fenton-type
or homolytic C–H bond dissociation), as the direct rebound
of CH3 radical with an OH group proceeds with a barrier
of E# ∼ 60 kJ/mol, while recombination
of the CH3 radical with an O2 molecule is a
barrierless reaction and the only barrier on the path to methyl hydroperoxide
is associated with H atom abstraction, which our calculations predict
to be very small (E# = 5 kJ/mol). Comparison
with experimental data is difficult, due to the complexity of the
reaction network and the potential decomposition of MeOOH to MeOH16 and to H2CO,47 and in situ analysis of the reaction mixture is not available. A
batch reaction study performed by Hutchings and co-workers16 shows that, at the beginning of the reaction,
selectivity toward MeOOH is high (∼60%), and it gradually decreases
during the course of the reaction. This supports the kinetic preference
for MeOOH formation over MeOH.

4 Conclusions
Different reaction paths for selective methane oxidation over a
binuclear Fe site deposited in ZSM-5 zeolite were studied by periodic
DFT calculations. The whole reaction cycle was investigated, including
formation of the active site, CH4 activation, product formation,
and regeneration of the initial site. Special attention was given
to the rate-determining C–H bond dissociation step, the possibility
of multiple mechanisms, and the influence of different active sites
on them. These mechanisms were (1) heterolytic, (2) homolytic and
(3) Fenton-type activation.

This study demonstrates that the
system cannot be reduced to a
single-site single-cycle concept. Even with the simplification to
a single type of Fe cluster at a given position of the zeolite framework,
the formation of multiple types of active sites is possible, catalyzing
three mechanistically different C–H bond activations.

The possibility of formation of different Fe(III) and Fe(IV) clusters
upon reaction with H2O2 was demonstrated. These
sites were proven to be catalytically active. Fe(III) was established
to promote heterolytic and Fenton-type reactions, while Fe(IV) was
shown to promote the homolytic reaction.

We found that the geometry
of the Fe complex significantly influences
the reaction energy but not the barrier of heterolytic C–H
bond activation. The calculations indicate that the type of activating
O (Fe=O, Fe−μO–Fe, or Fe–OH) is
unimportant from an energetic point of view for both types of activation.
We also found that confinement of the zeolite has a significant effect
on the reaction step.

Methanol can be formed following all types
of C–H bond activation
via recombination of CH3 and an OH ligand reducing the
active site. If the C–H bond was previously heterolytically
cleaved, this step can either precede or follow oxidation of the active
site by peroxo bond cleavage. After homolytic and Fenton-type dissociation,
this reduction step restores the initial oxidation state of the active
site. MeOOH can be obtained from the reaction of CH3 radical
and O2 molecule, followed by abstraction of a H atom from
the active site. After this step, the Fe site is in the oxidized form
available for further CH4 oxidation.

Since the reaction
is accompanied by excessive consumption of H2O2, its decomposition was also investigated. We
found that the same Fe(IV)–oxo sites promote the oxidation
of both H2O2 and CH4. The first reaction
will be dominant, as the activation barrier for O–H bond cleavage
is significantly lower than for C–H bond cleavage. This is
why we propose H2O2 to be an unsuitable oxidant
in combination with high-valent Fe clusters.
