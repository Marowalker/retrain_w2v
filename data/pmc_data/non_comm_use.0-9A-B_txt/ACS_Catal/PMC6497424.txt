The
biological production of FDCA is of considerable value as a potential
replacement for petrochemical-derived monomers such as terephthalate,
used in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics. HmfF belongs to
an uncharacterized branch of the prenylated flavin (prFMN) dependent
UbiD family of reversible (de)carboxylases and is proposed to convert
2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) to furoic acid in vivo. We present
a detailed characterization of HmfF and demonstrate that HmfF can
catalyze furoic acid carboxylation at elevated CO2 levels
in vitro. We report the crystal structure of a thermophilic HmfF from Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum, revealing that the
active site located above the prFMN cofactor contains a furoic acid/FDCA
binding site composed of residues H296-R304-R331 specific to the HmfF
branch of UbiD enzymes. Variants of the latter are compromised in
activity, while H296N alters the substrate preference to pyrrole compounds.
Solution studies and crystal structure determination of an engineered
dimeric form of the enzyme revealed an unexpected key role for a UbiD
family wide conserved Leu residue in activity. The structural insights
into substrate and cofactor binding provide a template for further
exploitation of HmfF in the production of FDCA plastic precursors
and improve our understanding of catalysis by members of the UbiD
enzyme family.

==== Body
Furan-based
components such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid are of considerable
value as potential (bio)replacements for petrochemical-derived monomers
such as terephthalate, which are used in polymers such as polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) plastics.1,2 A chemical synthesis
process for the carboxylation of furoic acid to FDCA has been recently
reported, using molten cesium salts at 200–350 °C.3 Furfural, the precursor to furoic acid, can be
readily produced by acid-catalyzed thermohydrolysis of hemicellulosic
material, a process that is already carried out on an industrial scale.4,5

A number of organisms are known to not only degrade furfural
and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) but also utilize these as their sole
carbon source.6 The pathway and associated
genes for furfural and HMF degradation were first identified in the
Gram-negative bacterium Cupriavidus basilensis HMF14.7 The genes are organized in two
distinct clusters: HmfA–E, which are essential for both furfural
and HMF degradation, and HmfF–H, which are required for HMF
degradation only. The key step linking the HMF and furfural degradation
pathways involved the decarboxylation of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid
(FDCA) to furoic acid (Figure 1a).7 This decarboxylation step
has been shown to be dependent on two gene products, HmfF and HmfG,
which are homologous to E. coli UbiD
and UbiX, respectively. The UbiD family of enzymes catalyze the reversible
nonoxidative decarboxylation of a wide range of aromatic and unsaturated
aliphatic compounds and are dependent for this activity on prenylated-FMN
(prFMN).8,9 The latter is synthesized by the prenyltransferase
UbiX from reduced FMN and dimethylallylphosphate (DMAP).10 The cofactor prFMN has been suggested to catalyze
(de)carboxylation via formation of a transient 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
adduct with the unsaturated substrate.11 While certain UbiD family members (Figure 1b and Figure S1) function to carboxylate aromatic hydrocarbons in vivo, most UbiD-like
enzymes act as decarboxylases in vivo.12 However, many of those that function physiologically as decarboxylases
have been shown to catalyze carboxylation in vitro when in the presence
of excess bicarbonate as a source of CO2.11,13,14

Figure 1 (A) Schematic for the C.
basilensis furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)
degradation pathway.7 Oxidation steps in
the upper part of the furfural and HMF pathway may be catalyzed either
by HmfH (orange asterisks) or by other nonspecific dehydrogenases
(black asterisks). ACC = electron acceptor, either oxidized (ACCox) or reduced (ACCred). (B) Overview of the UbiD
enzyme family: a phylogenetic tree of the characterized UbiD homologues.
The different branches can be grouped by substrate specificity indicated
by a representative substrate for the distinct groups. Groups for
which crystal structures are available are highlighted in color, while
an asterisk indicates prFMN confirmed as cofactor. HmfF belongs to
a distinct branch that is located close to the recently discovered
tAHMP decarboxylase.

Hence, we sought to understand whether HmfF can catalyze
reversible decarboxylation and demonstrate if it could produce FDCA
via carboxylation of furoic acid. Enzymatic FDCA production has been
reported starting from HMF and utilizing oxidoreductases such as HmfH.15 HmfF belongs to an uncharacterized branch of
the UbiD family and is most similar to the recently discovered trans-anhydromevalonate 5-phosphate decarboxylase (tAHMPDC)
involved in a novel archaeal mevalonate pathway (Figure 1b).16

In this paper we detail the biochemical characterization and
structure determination of HmfF from the thermophilic organism Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum. The insights into
prFMN-dependent carboxylation of furoic acid under high [CO2] conditions will support further exploitation of this enzyme in
the production of FDCA.

Results and Discussion
Initial Identification,
Expression, and Characterization of Thermostable FDCA (De)carboxylases
It has previously been reported that the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus kaustophilus HTA426 is capable of degrading
furfural.17 A BLAST search of the G. kaustophilus genome18 using the C. basilensis Hmf gene
cluster suggested the presence of a similar Hmf gene cluster located
on plasmid pHTA426. Although there is no mention in the literature
regarding the ability of G. kaustophilus to degrade HMF, a C. basilensis HmfF
homologue (WP_011229502) could be located on pHTA426, possessing 51%
sequence identity and located adjacent to a HmfG/UbiX homologue. Active
recombinant G. kaustophilus HmfF was
successfully produced in E. coli when
it was coexpressed with E. coli UbiX
(Figure S2). However, while soluble recombinant G. kaustophilus HmfF could be produced, the protein
had a tendency to aggregate, hampering crystallogenesis and other
biophysical studies. Other thermophilic HmfF homologues were screened,
with the P. thermopropionicum HmfF
enzyme being the most promising in terms of protein expression levels
and stability. The purified recombinant HmfF enzymes (from both P. thermopropionicum and G. kaustophilus) were capable of decarboxylating 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid to furoic
acid in vitro (Figure S2b) but could not
further decarboxylate furoic acid to furan.

Expression and Detailed
Characterization of P. thermopropionicum HmfF
Purified PtHmfF expressed in absence of E. coli UbiX coexpresssion was pale yellow and possessed
a UV–vis spectrum consistent with oxidized FMN binding. In
contrast, when it was coexpressed with UbiX, the purified recombinant
protein was pale pink, possessing a complex UV–vis spectrum
with three main features in addition to the protein peak at 280 nm
(Figure 2A). These
include a feature at 390 nm, similar to that observed previously for
the model system A. niger Fdc1,11 a peak at 450 nm (likely corresponding to the
presence of a subpopulation bound to oxidized FMN rather than prFMN),
and a broad peak centered around 550 nm. Similar spectral features
at 550 nm were previously identified as corresponding to the semiquinone
radical form of the prFMN cofactor.11,13,19

for heterologous expressed P. thermopropionicum HmfF. Spectra are shown of the WT protein expressed on its own (orange

or anaerobically (green). Spectra were normalized on the A280 peak. The inset shows the closeup of the cofactor-related
spectral features present in the 300–800 nm region. (B) UV–vis
spectra of single expressed “apo” P.

PtHmfF against aerobic or anaerobic substrate before and after exposure
to air. Assays were performed against 900 μM FDCA at 25 °C (error bars represent SEM, n = 3).

P. thermopropionicum HmfF in Vitro Reconstitution Confirms Oxidative Maturation Is Required
for Activity
While UbiX produces prFMN in a reduced state,
the cofactor must undergo oxidative maturation within UbiD to produce
the active prFMNiminium form.8−11 To investigate the requirement
for oxidative maturation of the cofactor in HmfF, apo-enzyme was reconstituted in vitro as described previously for AroY
and UbiD.13,19 Single expressed HmfF lacking decarboxylation
activity was reconstituted under anaerobic conditions and revealed
prominent features at 360 and 530 nm (Figure 2B). Exposure to air resulted in an enhancement
of the spectral features at 360–380, 450, and 530 nm, a range
of spectral features suggestive of a mixture of normal oxidized FMN,
prFMNradical, and possibly prFMNiminium, similar
to that observed in the as isolated coexpressed enzyme. Consistent
with this, the anaerobic reconstituted protein displayed low levels
of decarboxylase activity when it was assayed under anaerobic conditions.
However, the rate of enzymatic decarboxylation was 5-fold higher when
the protein was assayed under aerobic conditions (Figure 2C). Taken together, these data
confirm that, as with Fdc1 and AroY, HmfF requires oxidative maturation
of prFMN for activity.

PtHmfF Is Light and Oxygen
Sensitive
The activity of the as-isolated coexpressed PtHmfF was found to rapidly decrease over time when it was
stored on ice. The loss in activity appeared to be partially due to
light exposure, with the half-life of PtHmfF increasing
from 35 to ∼100 min when it was stored in the dark under aerobic
conditions (Figure S3). Similar observations
were made for the A. niger Fdc1 enzyme,
where light exposure was found to induce a complex isomerization of
the cofactor leading to inactivation.20 However, unlike Fdc1, protection from illumination was not sufficient
to stabilize PtHmfF activity. In contrast, PtHmfF stored under anaerobic conditions did not appear
to lose activity over the course of several hours, suggesting that
inactivation was also the result of O2, as observed for
AroY.13 Subsequently, PtHmfF was either purified anaerobically or purified aerobically and
then reconstituted in vitro and assayed under anaerobic conditions.
The PtHmfF enzyme activity was found to have a pH
optimum between 6 and 6.5, with a temperature maximum of ∼60
°C (Figure 3).
However, from 55 °C and above the activity decreased rapidly
over the course of a few minutes, indicating that the enzyme was being
inactivated, making it difficult to obtain accurate initial rates.
Thermal denaturation of PtHmfF monitored using CD
spectroscopy revealed a melting temperature of ∼68 °C
(Figure S4). Thus, all subsequent assays
were performed at 50 °C. An Arrhenius plot of the 25–50
°C data points indicated an activation energy of 80.7 kJ mol–1. At pH 6 and 50 °C, the apparent Km and kcat values for FDCA
were 49.4(±3.7) μM and 2.39(±0.05) s–1, respectively (Figure 3C). The PtHmfF enzyme was also found to have minor
activity with 2,5-pyrroledicarboxylic acid (PDCA). In contrast, no
decarboxylation could be detected for 2,3-furandicarboxylic acid,
5-formyl-2-furoic acid, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid, 5-nitro-2-furoic
acid, 2,5-thiophenedicarboxylic acid, 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid,
terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, or muconic acid.

PtHmfF Catalyzes H/D Exchange of a Small Range of
Heteroaromatic Acids
It has previously been shown that UbiD
enzymes are capable of catalyzing deuterium exchange of substrates
that can undergo UbiD-mediated carboxylation.20,211H NMR showed that incubation of furoic acid with PtHmfF in D2O resulted in depletion of the resonance
peak at 7.6 ppm consistent with exchange of the proton in the 5-position
(denoted Ha) with a deuteron (Figure S5). This was further supported by a change in splitting of
the 6.5 ppm resonance (corresponding to Hb) from a doublet
of doublets to a doublet resulting from the loss of coupling between
Hb and Ha. Partial H/D exchange of the 5-position
of pyrrole-2-carboxylate (∼30%, Figure S4B) could also be observed under the conditions tested; however,
no exchange of thiophene-2-carboxylate was detected (Figure S5C). These observations confirm that the level of
H/D exchange follows the same trend as observed for the level of decarboxylation
of the corresponding diacids. With this in mind, we used H/D exchange
to assay PtHmfF against substrates where the corresponding
diacids were not commercially available. The proton in the 5-position
of 2-oxazolecarboxylic acid could only be readily exchanged for deuterium
in the presence of enzyme (Figure S5D).
In contrast, no enzyme-dependent exchange could be observed for position
2 of 5-oxazolecarboxylic acid (Figure S5E).

PtHmfF and GkHmfF Catalyze
Furoic Acid Carboxylation at Elevated [CO2]
The
HmfF reverse reaction, carboxylation, has been demonstrated to occur
in vivo for distinct UbiD members that function as dedicated carboxylases,22−24 while those family members that act as decarboxylases under physiological
conditions (such as AroY and Fdc1) can catalyze carboxylation in vitro
at elevated levels of CO2.11,13,14 To investigate the ability of HmfF enzymes to catalyze
the reverse reaction, carboxylation of furoic acid to produce FDCA,
purified PtHmfF and GkHmfF enzymes
were incubated with 50 mM furoic acid and 1 M bicarbonate at 50 °C
overnight. HPLC analysis of the reaction mixtures revealed a peak
with retention time of 2.3 min that comigrates with an FDCA standard
(Figure 4A). Mass spectrometry
confirmed that this species had a mass of 154.99 Da, consistent with
the expected mass for FDCA. We sought to determine whether performing
the reaction under pressurized CO2 could increase the amount
of carboxylated product. Reaction mixtures containing 50 mM furoic
acid were incubated overnight with HmfF at 50 °C. In the presence
of 1 M KHCO3, there was no significant difference between
reaction mixtures incubated under N2 at atmospheric pressure
or under CO2 at 32 bar with ∼2 mM FDCA produced.
In the absence of bicarbonate, ∼150 μM FDCA was produced
under 32 bar CO2, whereas no FDCA was detectable under
N2 (Figure 4B). While HmfF presents an attractive route to the production of
2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, a potential bioreplacement for polymer
precursors, yields remain low even under high [CO2]. Given
the unfavorable equilibrium for the carboxylation reaction, future
efforts aimed at increasing the yield for this reaction will likely
require in situ conversion of FDCA.

with the FDCA standard also possessed a mass consistent with FDCA.

PtHmfF
Crystal Structures Reveal FMN Binding Mode
To aid crystallization,
the PtHmfF was expressed without affinity tag. The
best crystals obtained belonged to the P21 space group and diffracted to 2.7 Å. The procedure was repeated
with Se-Met-substituted enzyme, and the structure was solved using
Se-Met SAD, revealing a PtHmfF hexamer (D3 symmetry) in the asymmetric unit. Although the UV–vis
spectra of the purified enzyme used for crystallization trials indicated
the presence of cofactor, no electron density corresponding to the
cofactor could be detected in preliminary electron density maps. Final
refinement was done using data collected to 2.7 Å on PtHmfF crystals soaked with FMN (as a stable analogue of
the prFMN cofactor) in the presence of K+ and Mn2+, revealing clear electron density for both the FMN and the associated
metal ions in the prFMN binding site (Figure S6). The PtHmfF structure is similar to other UbiD
family member structures with a Z score of 47 with
the bacterial protocatechuate decarboxylase AroY (rmsd 1.6 Å
over 441 C-αs),13 45 with the E. coli UbiD (rmsd 2.5 Å over 440 C-αs),19 40 with the fungal cinnamic acid decarboxylase
Fdc1 (rmsd 3.1 Å over 440 C-αs)11 and 38 with recently solved TtnD decarboxylase involved in polyketide
biosynthesis (rmsd 2.7 Å over 414 C-αs).25 The PtHmfF monomer consists of an N-terminal
prFMN binding domain connected via an α-helical linker to the
oligomerization domain (Figure 5). The C-terminus consists of an extended loop region with
some α-helical character that interacts with the prFMN binding
domain of an adjacent PtHmfF monomer. An overlay
of the six PtHmfF monomers reveals that minor variation
occurs in the respective positions of the N-terminal prFMN binding
domain and the oligomerization domain, suggestive of domain motion
via the hinge region connecting both domains (Figure 5B). As the active site (vide infra) is located
at the interface between both domains, this could be relevant to catalysis.
The phosphate moiety of the bound FMN is coordinated by Mn2+ and K+ ions (the identity of these was derived from the
fact they were added to the crystal and was not independently verified),
while the isoalloxazine is positioned directly adjacent to the conserved
E(D)-R-E ionic network of residues conserved in UbiD (Figure 5C). In the case of PtHmfF, the active site is only partly occluded from solvent
as a consequence of the relatively open conformation of the N-terminal
prFMN binding domain; this is similar to what has been observed for
the canonical UbiD and AroY enzymes (Figure S7). To achieve full occlusion from solvent, as is observed for the
fungal Fdc1 enzyme, a hinge motion (akin to that observed by comparison
of the various PtHmfF monomers) leading to a closed
conformation would be required.

in (A). In the case of the Aspergillus niger Fdc1 enzyme, the α-fluorocinnamic acid complex is shown, with
the substrate shown in cyan carbons. In the case of the TtnD enzyme,
the loop containing residues E272–E277 is not ordered in the
FMN-bound structure. The conserved E(D)-R-E motif is highlighted by
the use of red labels.

PtHmfF Active Site Contains a Furoic Acid Binding
Motif
All attempts to acquire a crystal structure of the PtHmfF in complex with substrate through either soaking
or cocrystallization failed, a possible consequence of the open configuration
of the enzyme. Guided by the structure of the related Fdc1 in complex
with cinnamic acid substrates,11 FDCA can
easily be placed into the active site of PtHmfF in
a similar position with respect to the prFMN cofactor. This positions
the substrate furan oxygen approximately within hydrogen-bonding distance
of His296 and locates the distal substrate carboxylate adjacent to
Arg304 and Arg331. All three putative substrate binding residues are
conserved in the HmfF branch of the UbiD family tree (Figure S1). To support our hypothesis regarding
the role of H296, R304, and R331 in substrate binding, we made PtHmfF H296N, R304A, and R331A variants. All variants possess
UV–vis spectra similar to that of the WT with the exception
of the H296N variant (Figure 6A). In the latter case, cofactor related features between
300 and 400 nm are less intense, indicating lower cofactor content.
Prolonged incubation of large quantities of protein with substrate
resulted in complete decarboxylation of FDCA by WT PtHmfF and the R304A variant (assayed by HPLC). Under these conditions,
H296N was able to decarboxylate ∼87% of the substrate, in comparison
with 30% using the R331A variant (Figure 6B). Using PDCA as a substrate, only the WT
and H296N were able to perform 100% decarboxylation (Figure 6C). A continuous spectrophotometrically
based assay (using 1 mM substrate) revealed that all three variants
were severely compromised in activity in comparison to the wild type
enzyme, with kcat values 30–400
fold lower than the WT against FDCA (Figure 6D). Interestingly, the H296N variant displays
a preference for 2,5-pyrroledicarboxylic acid over FDCA and has a
slightly higher activity for PDCA in comparison to the WT enzyme (Figure 6D). Michaelis–Menten
kinetics revealed that both R304A and H296N variants were not saturated
at 1 mM substrate (the maximum possible under the experimental conditions),
while no reliable data could be obtained for R331A (Figure 6E). These data clearly indicate
the FDCA affinity has been compromised by substitutions at positions
H296, R304, and R331.

A Dimeric PtHmfF Variant Binds prFMN but Is Compromised for Activity
The resolution of the hexameric PtHmfF structures
obtained is limited and is in sharp contrast to the atomic resolution
routinely achieved for the dimeric A. niger Fdc1. A structural alignment of PtHmfF hexamer
with the related A. niger Fdc1 dimer
structure demonstrates that PtHmfF A315, N348, F351,
T355, A388, F393, V395, and M399 form key hydrophobic interactions
between the individual PtHmfF dimers. In Fdc1, the
equivalent positions are D343, R382, D385, N389, P424, T429, F431,
and R435, respectively: i.e. generally larger and/or charged residues.
We created a PtHmfF variant by substituting for the
corresponding A. niger Fdc1 amino acids
(i.e., A315N, N348R, F351D, T355N, A388P, F393T, V395F, and M399R)
to disrupt dimer–dimer interactions. SEC-MALLS of the purified PtHmfF dimer variant indicated a native mass of 110 kDa,
broadly consistent with the expected mass of a dimer. Similarly to
the WT protein, the purified dimer variant possesses a complex UV–vis
spectrum with three main features in the 300–800 nm region
(Figure S8). This suggests the presence
of prFMN, in addition to minor populations of FMN and the radical
prFMN. Despite the presence of prFMN, the dimer variant display weak
activity, and incubation of 10 mM FDCA against 20 μM PtHmfF dimer mutant only resulted in 30% decarboxylation
following overnight incubation (Figure 6B).

Crystal Structure of Dimeric PtHmfF Suggests a Key Role for a Conserved Leu in Activity
The P. thermopropionicum HmfF dimer
variant was crystallized and the structure solved to 2.3 Å using
molecular replacement with the WT PtHmfF monomer.
Unlike the wild type enzyme, the dimer variant crystals contain prFMN
in the active site. Despite the extensive mutation of the WT dimer–dimer
interface, the PtHmfF dimer variant is very similar
in structure to an individual dimer module from the WT hexamer. The
prFMN is bound in a similar position and configuration as the FMN
in the PtHmfF hexamer, with little difference in
the position of the majority of active site residues. A notable exception
is Leu403, which is located on a loop region that is disordered in
the PtHmfF dimer variant and therefore absent from
the active site (Figure 7). The 398–410 region including Leu403 is disordered in both
the PtHmfF dimer variant monomers, a likely consequence
of the M399R mutation and/or the disruption of the WT dimer–dimer
interface. As a consequence, the PtHmfF dimer variant
active site is exposed to the solvent. To confirm whether the absence
of Leu from the dimer active site contributed to the low activity
of the dimer mutant, a L403A PtHmfF was created.
While the UV–vis profiles of both WT and the L403A variant
are comparable, the latter had a kcat value
∼40-fold lower than that of the WT (Figure 6D,E). However, unlike the H296 and R304/331
variants, the L403A Km value for FDCA
was not significantly different from the WT, suggesting that L403
does not contribute to substrate binding. The hydrophobic nature of
the carboxylic acid binding pocket has been implicated in the mechanism
of other decarboxylases,26,27 and it is plausible
that the highly conserved Leu403 fulfils a similar role. Furthermore,
Leu403 is one of the residues most affected by the proposed domain
motion (Figure 5B and Figure S7) that occludes the PtHmfF active site from solvent.

respect the prFMN cofactor is shown (in cyan), as well as the corresponding
position of L439 (homologous to PtHmfF L403).

Proposed Mechanism for
HmfF
Previous studies for the Fdc1 enzyme have suggested
that the reversible decarboxylation occurs via a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
between substrate and prFMN. In principle, a similar reaction scheme
can be proposed for any of the UbiD substrates. However, for those
substrates where (de)carboxylation occurs directly on an aromatic
ring system, cycloaddition also requires dearomatization. An alternative
proposal has been put forward for AroY, on the basis of formation
of a quinoid intermediate that allows formation of a substrate–prFMN
adduct. In view of the modest aromatic nature of the furan ring, an
FDCA or furoic acid adduct with prFMN could be formed through either
cycloaddition (Ib in Figure 8) or via formation of an oxonium ion (Ia in Figure 8) in the case of HmfF. Chemical
precedent exists for the 1,3-cycloaddition of furans to 1,3-dipoles.28 It is unclear at present which route is preferred
for HmfF, and this will require further investigation. However, it
is interesting to note that HmfF-catalyzed H/D exchange can be readily
observed for weakly aromatic heteroaromatic acids only at those positions
that are adjacent to a carbon, hinting at the possibility that species
Ib is indeed formed during the enzyme reaction. Furthermore, neither
decarboxylation of the more aromatic thiophenedicarboxylic acid nor
H/D exchange of thiophene-2-carboxylate was observed. In fact, thiophene
compounds are not known to readily undergo cycloaddition reactions,
in contrast to furan. While HmfF is able to catalyze furoic acid carboxylation
under ambient conditions, this requires a mechanism for increasing
[CO2]. Other decarboxylases have been found to catalyze
pyrrole carboxylation in supercriticial CO2,29 and we intend to explore whether HmfF (natural
or evolved variants) can be used under these conditions. Further studies
will also need to address cofactor stability and homogeneity to ensure
a robust biocatalyst for the carboxylation of furoic acid.

Figure 8 Proposal for
the HmfF mechanism. The HmfF substrate is bound by polar interactions
with the HmfF specific R304/R331 and H296, in addition to the UbiD
family conserved R152 (part of the UbiD Glu-Arg-Glu motif). Substrate
binding is possibly linked to domain motion, affecting the relative
position of L403 and R331. Formation of a covalent prFMNiminium–substrate adduct can occur either through nucleophilic attack,
leading to species Ia, or through cycloaddition, leading to species
Ib. Decarboxylation of either species leads to intermediate II, following
E260/CO2 exchange; protonation of the substrate via E260
leading to product release occurs through either intermediate IVa
or IVb.

Methods
Cloning of Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum and Geobacillus
kaustophilus HmfF for E. coli Heterologous
Expression
The P. thermopropionicum 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid decarboxylase (HmfF) gene (WP_012031668),
and G. kaustophilus HmfF gene (WP_011229502)
were codon optimized for E. coli and
synthesized (Genscript). The G. kaustophilus HmfF gene was synthesized with NdeI and XhoI restriction sites upstream and downstream of the coding
region, respectively. The gene was excised from the pUC57 plasmid
using NdeI and XhoI (NEB) and purified
using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The insert was ligated
in to NdeI/XhoI linearized pET30a
(MerckMillipore) using T4 ligase (NEB).

The P.
thermopropionicum HmfF gene was amplified using Phusion
polymerase (NEB) and the primers Ptherm30aF (AAGGAGATATACATATGTCCCACTCCCTGCG)
and Ptherm30aR (GGTGGTGGTGCTCGAGTTCCAGGTAGTCTGCCAG)
(Eurofins), and the PCR product was cloned into pET30a (MerckMillipore)
linearized with NdeI and XhoI (NEB)
using Infusion HD (Clontech) and transformed into E.
coli NEB5α(NEB). The plasmid was transformed
into E. coli BL21(DE3) (NEB) either
on its own or cotransformed with ubiXpET21b as described previously.11

Mutagenesis
Mutagenesis primers
were designed using the QuikChange Primer Design Program (http://www.genomics.agilent.com/primerDesignProgram.jsp). PCR was performed using Phusion polymerase (NEB). Template DNA
was removed by DpnI (NEB) digest, and the PCR product
was transformed into E. coli NEB5α.
Once the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing,
the plasmid was cotransformed with ubiXpET21b into E. coli BL21(DE3).

Expression and Purification
of His-Tagged HmfF Proteins
The various HmfF enzymes were
expressed in BL21(DE3) grown at 37 °C/180 rpm in LB broth supplemented
with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL ampicillin. At mid
log phase cells were induced with 0.25 mM IPTG and supplemented with
1 mM MnCl2, grown overnight at 15 °C/180 rpm and then
harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 7000g for
10 min). Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (200 mM KCl, 1
mM MnCl2, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) supplemented with DNase, RNase,
lysozyme (Sigma), and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Cells were lysed using a French press at 20000 psi, and the
lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 125000g for 90 min. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column
(Qiagen). The column washed with three column volumes of buffer A
supplemented with 10 mM imidazole, and the protein eluted in 1 mL
fractions with buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. Samples
were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and fractions found to contain
the purified protein were pooled. Imidazole was removed using a 10-DG
desalting column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. Protein was
aliquoted and flash frozen until required. Where necessary, HmfF Ni2+-affinity purification was performed anaerobically within
a ∼100% N2 atmosphere glovebox (Belle Technology,
U.K.).

Production and Purification of Untagged P. thermopropionicum HmfF
For the purposes of crystallization and structural
characterization untagged PtHmfF was used. To produce untagged P. thermopropionicum, HmfF the gene was amplified
using the primers Ptherm21bF (AAGGAGATATACATATGTCCCACTCCCTGCG)
and Ptherm21bR (GGTGGTGGTGCTCGAGTTATTATTCCAGGTAGTCTGCCAG)
and cloned into NdeI/XhoI linearized
with pET21b (MerckMillipore). The UbiX gene was amplified using the
primers UbiXF (AGGAGATATACCATGGGGTCAGGTCC)
and UbiXR (CTTTACCAGACTCGAGTTATTCGTCTGAAACCAGGTGTTG)
and cloned into pCDF (MerckMillipore) linearized with NcoI and XhoI.

Once the sequence of the desired
insert was confirmed, the corresponding purified plasmids were cotransformed
into E. coli BL21(DE3).

Protein
expression was performed as described above, except the antibiotics
used were 50 μg/mL streptomycin and 50 μg/mL ampicillin.
Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (200 mM KCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5) supplemented with DNase, RNase, lysozyme
(Sigma), and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
Cells were lysed using a French press at 20000 psi, and the lysate
was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min to precipitate host proteins.
The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 125000g for 90 min. The P. thermopropionicum HmfF was precipitated with 30% saturated ammonium sulfate at 4 °C,
the supernatant was removed following centrifugation, the pellet was
solubilized in buffer A and subjected to size exclusion chromatography
using a HiPrep S200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer
A, and 2 mL fractions were collected. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE
analysis, and fractions found to contain the purified protein were
pooled. Protein was aliquoted and flash-frozen until required.

Expression
of Selenomethionine-Labeled HmfF
Untagged P. thermopropionicum HmfF was expressed in nonauxotrophic
Bl21(DE3) and labeled with selenomethionine by growth on amino acids
known to inhibit the methionine biosynthesis pathway.30 Precultures grown in LB media were inoculated into M9 media
supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 50 μg/mL streptomycin, and 50
μg/mL ampicillin. At mid log phase cultures were further supplemented
with phenylalanine, lysine, and threonine (100 mg/L), isoleucine,
leucine, valine (50 mg/L), and 60 mg/L selenomethionine. Cells were
induced with 0.25 mM IPTG and grown overnight at 15 °C/180 rpm
and then harvested by centrifugation (4 °C, 7000g for 10 min).

P. thermopropionicum HmfF
Dimer Mutant Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification
The Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum HmfF gene with eight substitutions designed to disrupt the trimer
of dimers (A315N, N348R, F351D, T355N, A388P, F393T, V395F, M399R)
was codon-optimized to remove codons that were rare in E. coli and synthesized (GeneArt). The gene was amplified
by PCR using the primers PtDimer_28aF (CGCGCGGCAGCCATATGAGCCATAGCCTGCG)
and PtDimer_28aR (GGTGGTGGTGCTCGAGTTATTATTCCAGATAATCGGCCAG)
and cloned in to pET28a linearized with NdeI and XhoI using Infusion (Clontech). Protein was expressed and
purified by Ni affinity as described above before being subjected
to size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrep S200 column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with buffer A, and 2 mL fractions were collected.

UV–Vis
Spectroscopy and Protein Quantification
UV–vis absorbance
spectra were recorded with a Cary UV–vis spectrophotometer.
The protein concentration was estimated from the A280 absorption peak with extinction coefficients calculated
from the primary amino acid sequence using the ProtParam program on
the ExPASy proteomics server. P. thermopropionicum HmfF was estimated using ε280 = 28420 M–1 cm–1 and G. kaustophilus HmfF using ε280 = 31860 M–1 cm–1.

HmfF Decarboxylation Assays Monitored by
UV–Vis
Initial rates of FDCA decarboxylation were
determined by UV–vis spectroscopy at 265 nm using the extinction
coefficient ε265 = 18000 M–1 cm–1, using a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian).
Assays were performed against various concentrations of substrate
in 350 μL of 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaPi pH 6 in a 1 mm path length
cuvette at 50 °C.

HmfF Decarboxylation Assays
Monitored by HPLC
Typical assays containing 500 μL
of 10 mM substrate in 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaPi pH 6 with or without enzyme
(typically 20 μM) were set up in an anaerobic glovebox in 2
mL crimp-seal vials before being removed to a 50 °C incubator.
After incubation, 50 μL of the sample was added to 450 μL
of 50% v/v H2O/acetonitrile and centrifuged at 16100g to remove precipitate. Sample analysis was performed using
an Agilent 1260 Infinity Series HPLC equipped with a UV detector.
The stationary phase was a Kinetex 5 μm C18 100A column, 250
× 4.6 mm. The mobile phase was acetonitrile/water (50/50) with
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min, and unless
otherwise stated, detection was performed at a wavelength of 265 nm.

HmfF Carboxylation Reactions Assayed by HPLC/HPLC-MS
Assays
containing 50 mM furoic acid, 100 mM KPi pH6, 1 M KHCO3 (final pH 7.5) were incubated with and without HmfF enzyme at 50
°C overnight. The sample was centrifuged at 16100g to remove precipitate and 10 μL added to 490 μL of 50%
v/v H2O/acetonitrile. Sample analysis was typically performed
by HPLC as described above. For carboxylation under pressurized CO2, reaction mixtures were set up as above and then placed in
an Asynt 250 mL stainless-steel autoclave pressurized to 32 bar with
CO2 which was incubated at 50 °C overnight. Before
the pressure was released, the temperature was increased to 100 °C
for 10 min to denature the enzyme.

LC-MS was performed to confirm
the identity of the carboxylation product. The reaction was carried
out as above but with ammonium bicarbonate in place of KHCO3. Analysis was performed using UHPLC (Dionex ultimate 3000) combined
with high-resolution mass spectrometry (Thermo Scientific Q Exactive
Plus). The samples were run under the negative mode. For the full
scan, the mass spectrometry scan range was set as m/z 50–300: resolving power 50000 (fwhm at m/z 200), spray voltage 3 kV, capillary
temperature 250 °C, capillary voltage 25 V, tube lens voltage
170 V, skimmer voltage 36 V. Mobile phase A (0.05% formic acid, H2O) and mobile phase B (0.05% formic acid, acetonitrile) were
used for separating the samples; the mobile phase started from 5%
B and increased to 95% B in 3 min, and the flow rate was 0.6 mL/min.

1H NMR Monitored Enzyme Catalyzed Deuterium Exchange
A mixture of 10 mM substrate and 100 mM NaPi pD 6.4 in D2O was incubated overnight at 50 °C with and without 10 μM
HmfF. Data were collected at 298 K on a Bruker 500 MHz NMR AVIII spectrometer
with QCI-F cryprobe, using the noesygppr1d pulse sequence with 3 s
acquisition time plus 1 s recycle delay, accumulating 32 scans.

Size Exclusion Chromatography Coupled to Multi-Angle Light Scattering
(SEC-MALS)
Size exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle
light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis was performed at 25 °C.
A 500 μL portion of 1.5 mg/mL protein was loaded onto a size
exclusion column (for the native protein a Superose 6 10/300 GL column
was used and for the dimer mutant a Superdex 200 10/300GL column (GE
Life Sciences)), equilibrated in 200 mM KCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5 and a flow rate of 0.75 mL/min. Eluting samples
were passed through a Wyatt DAWN Heleos II EOS 18-angle laser photometer
coupled to a Wyatt Optilab rEX refractive index detector. Data were
analyzed using Astra 6 software (Wyatt Technology Corp., CA, USA).

Enzyme Reconstitution in Vitro
Reconstitution was performed
anaerobically within a 100% N2 atmosphere glovebox (Belle
Technology, UK). Holo-PtHmfF was obtained by reconstituting
singly expressed HmfF with reduced prFMN under anaerobic conditions
as described previously.19 Reaction of
a mixture consisting of 1 mM FMN, 2 mM DMAP (Sigma), 50 μM Fre
reductase, and 50 μM UbiX in buffer A was started by the addition
of 5 mM NADH. Following incubation, the reaction mixture was filtered
through a 10k MWCO centrifugal concentrator to remove UbiX and Fre
proteins. The filtrate containing the prFMN product was used to reconstitute
anaerobic apo-HmfF in a 2:1 molar ratio, with excess
cofactor being removed using a PD25 desalting column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with buffer A. Enzyme assays were performed by UV–vis
spectroscopy using a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian) as described
above.

CD Monitored Thermal Changes in PtHmfF
A 2 mg/mL PtHmfF
sample in 50 mM KCl, 50 mM NaPi pH6 was used. Circular dichroism spectra
were recorded between 190 and 260 nm in a 0.1 mm path length cuvette
using an Applied Photophysics Chirascan CD spectrophotometer. The
temperature was ramped from 20 to 95 °C in 5 °C increments
with 2 min equilibration time before each measurement.

Crystallization
of PtHmfF and PtHmfF Dimer Variant
Purified Pelotomaculum thermopropionicum HmfF in 100 mM NaCl,
25 mM Tris, pH 7.5 was concentrated in a Vivaspin 30 kDa cut off spin
concentrator to a final concentration of 11 mg/mL. Initial screening
by sitting drop vapor diffusion was performed; mixing 0.3 μL
of protein with 0.3 μL of mother liquor led to crystals under
a variety of conditions on incubation at 21 °C. The best-performing
crystals originated from column 10 of the Morpheus commercial screen
(Molecular Dimensions) consisting of 0.1 M Tris/BICINE buffer pH 8.5,
20% v/v ethylene glycol, and 10% w/v PEG 8000. Crystals of the P. thermopropionicum HmfF dimer mutant were attained
as above but were grown at 4 °C in condition D6 of the Morpheus
screen (Molecular Dimensions) consisting of 0.12 M alcohols, 0.1 M
NaHEPES/MOPS buffer pH 7.5, 20% v/v ethylene glycol, and 10% w/v PEG
8000.

Diffraction Data Collection and Structure Elucidation
Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected
at the Diamond beamlines and subsequently handled using the CCP4 suite.22 All data were reduced and scaled using XDS.31 Interpretable maps were obtained from Se-Met-substituted
crystals following 6-fold NCS averaging using DM.32 An initial model was automatically generated using Buccaneer32 and iteratively rebuilt and refined using Coot
and REFMAC5.32 The final model was refined
using data extending to 2.7 Å for a crystal soaked with FMN with
six monomers in the asymmetric unit. The structure of the prFMN containing
HmfF dimer mutant was solved using molecular replacement with the
HmfF wild type structure as a search model and iteratively rebuilt
and refined using Coot and REFMAC5. For final data and refinement
statistics see Table S1.
