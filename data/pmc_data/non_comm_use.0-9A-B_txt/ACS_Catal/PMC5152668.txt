Azines
(2,3-diazabuta-1,3-dienes) are a widely used class of compounds
with conjugated C=N double bonds. Herein, we present a direct
synthesis of azines from alcohols and hydrazine hydrate. The reaction,
catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer complex, evolves dihydrogen and can
be run in a base-free version. The dehydrogenative coupling of benzylic
and aliphatic alcohols led to good conversions and yields. Spectroscopic
evidence for a hydrazine-coordinated dearomatized ruthenium pincer
complex was obtained. Isolation of a supramolecular crystalline compound
provided evidence for the important role of hydrogen bonding networks
under the reaction conditions.

==== Body
Azines (R2C=N–N=CR2), namely,
2,3-diazabuta-1,3-dienes, are an important class
of compounds that display diverse reactivity and are useful for many
applications, such as the synthesis of N-heterocycles and functional
polymers.1,2 Metal-promoted transformations of azines
have led to new synthetic applications.3 Azine formation has also proven beneficial in studying metal-mediated
N2 activation.4 Recently, azines
have generated much interest in the construction of covalent organic
frameworks (COFs) having photocatalytic activity5 or serving as chemosensing detectors.6 Because of their unique electronic structure and stereochemical
versatility,7 azine units give also rise
to remarkable chromophoric properties8 and
are interesting as nonlinear optical materials.9 Applications as ferroelectric liquid crystals were also
described.10 The biological activity of
azine derivatives holds promise for pharmacological applications.11

Azines are generally synthesized by reaction
of carbonyl compounds
with hydrazine hydrate or hydrazones,12 even though some effort in enhancing this general method was undertaken
in recent years.13 Aside from that, only
a small number of alternative routes were reported,3b,14−16 such as the reaction of diazoalkanes with carbenes
or carbenoids3b,14b,14c,15 or the transformation of a tetrazole
with cyclooctyne.14d However, all of these
methods lack generality and are limited to a few very specific substrates.
Recently, Chiba reported the conversion of vinyl azides to α-trifluoromethyl
azines, which are precursors to various fluorinated compounds.16

One of the major challenges in the field
of catalysis is the development
of environmentally benign transformations of widely accessible starting
materials into synthetically valuable products. In recent years, our
group reported on new catalytic procedures based on the concept of
metal–ligand cooperation,17 which
involves reversible aromatization/dearomatization within the ligand
backbone. Using pincer-type complexes, this concept has become an
important paradigm in the development of unprecedented one-step reactions
toward fundamental building blocks, while avoiding the formation of
waste and excessive use of costly or toxic reagents.18

The dehydrogenative coupling of alcohols and amines
catalyzed by
pyridine-based pincer ruthenium complexes has led to the synthesis
of amides,19 imines,20 peptides, pyrazines,21 and pyrroles.22 Lately, our group reported the development of
hydrogen storage systems based on amide bond formation.23 Ruthenium- and iridium-catalyzed dehydrogenative
coupling of alcohols with substituted hydrazines are known as well,24 but the direct use of N2H4 in catalysis is very challenging. Very recently, Ru-catalyzed reaction
of primary alcohols with hydrazine resulted in alcohol deoxygenation.25

Herein, we present the first direct synthesis
of azines from alcohols.
The reaction is based on acceptorless dehydrogenative coupling of
alcohols and hydrazine catalyzed by a ruthenium pincer complex (Figure 1). This one-step
strategy is atom-economical and environmentally benign, forming azines
directly from readily available, sustainable starting materials while
producing H2. Mechanistic insight, including involvement
of hydrogen bonding in this process, which has led to the isolation
of a supramolecular crystalline compound, and an unexpected role of
molecular sieves, is provided.

Figure 1 Ruthenium PNP pincer complexes studied
for azine synthesis ([P]
= P(tBu)2). Molecular structure of [(tBuPNP)Ru(CO)H] [PF6] (3) (H atoms
at carbon are omitted for the sake of clarity).

Exploring the best reaction conditions for the coupling reaction,
4-methoxybenzyl alcohol was chosen as a model system (Table 1). Heating a solution of 4-methoxybenzyl
alcohol and hydrazine hydrate in the presence of 0.5 mol % 1(20) and 1.5 mol % KOtBu in toluene at reflux for 50 h resulted in only 32% of
4-methoxybenzaldazine, along with 34% aldehyde and 25% ester (Table 1, entry 1). Using
the isolated dearomatized complex 2(20) instead of in situ deprotonation of 1 with a base, the conversion was lower (50%) but the relative
amounts of azine (15%), aldehyde (18%), and ester (10%) remained the
same (Table 1, entry
2). Significantly, upon the addition of molecular sieves (3 Å)
to the reaction catalyzed by 1 and a base, full conversion
was obtained, the desired azine being obtained as the only product
under otherwise identical conditions (entry 3). Carrying out the reaction
with complex 2 (0.5 mol %) in the presence of
molecular sieves but without a base, the azine was also selectively
obtained, although in lower conversion (62%) and yield (58%, entry
4 in Table 1). Unexpectedly,
in a base-free variant, starting directly from the aromatic complex 1 (0.5 mol %), the coupling reaction of the alcohol and hydrazine
proceeded smoothly (91% conversion) with high yield (91%) and without
the formation of any side products (entry 5 in Table 1). Performing the same reaction with no molecular
sieves and no base using 1 (0.5 mol %), the conversion
was negligible (9%), the azine being formed in only 6% yield (entry
6 in Table 1). As shown
in entries 7 and 8 in Table 1, we also studied Na2SO4 and γ-Al2O3 as water-capturing additives in the azine synthesis.
Although the reaction was totally inhibited by Na2SO4, the use of γ-alumina led to good conversion (78%)
and the formation of 66% azine. Even when using the chloride-free
cationic complex [(tBuPNP)Ru(CO)H]+[PF6]− (3) (Figure 1) in the presence of molecular sieves, the
reaction proceeded smoothly, albeit the yield of the desired azine
was only 48% (entry 9 in Table 1). However, no conversion was observed with 3 in the absence of molecular sieves (entry 10 in Table 1). These findings lead to the
conclusion that the presence of molecular sieves or γ-alumina
is crucial, and that the hydrazine-containing reaction conditions
are capable of forming an active catalyst species directly from complex 1 without the need of added base. Significantly, complexes 1 and 3 were completely inactive toward dehydrogenation
of 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol, whereas the dearomatized complex 2 led to full conversion after 50 h of heating at toluene
reflux and gave both aldehyde (45%) and ester (54%). These findings
suggest that, under the reaction conditions, complex 1 is converted to an active dearomatized catalyst with the assistance of excess hydrazine, prior
to the actual catalytic cycle, since dehydrogenation of the alcohol
to form the aldehyde is required for condensation with hydrazine to
form an azine.

a Reaction conditions:
Complexes 1–3, alcohol (2.5 mmol),
hydrazine hydrate
(0.7 equiv., 1.75 mmol), KOtBu (0–1.5 mol
%), and toluene (5 mL) were heated at reflux in a Schlenk flask (oil
bath temperature: 130 °C) for 50 h.

b Conversion of alcohol and yields
of products were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy, using N,N-dimethylformamide as an internal standard,
supported by GC/MS analysis.

c In the presence of molecular sieves
(3 Å) (1 g).

d In the
presence of Na2SO4 (1 g).

e In the presence of γ-Al2O3 (0.6 g).

f Addition
of excess water (0.2 mL).

It was of interest to us to get more information regarding the
role of molecular sieves. Normally, it is assumed that they act just
as a water scavenger. Surprisingly, an addition of excess water to
an experiment under normal conditions, using molecular sieves, had
little effect on the reaction (compare entries 5 and 11 in Table 1). Next, a mixture
of hydrazine hydrate, complex 1, and molecular sieves
in toluene, in the absence of alcohol, was heated at reflux for 17
h. The sieves were then removed and 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol was added
to the supernatant solution and the solution was refluxed for 29 h;
to our surprise, no azine was formed, although 25% aldehyde was still
obtained. 4-Methoxybenzyl alcohol was then added to the removed molecular
sieves in fresh toluene and the mixture was refluxed for 50 h, leading
to high conversion (85%) of the alcohol to form the azine (58%), along
with the aldehyde (23%). Hence, it is obvious that hydrazine remains
attached to the molecular sieves, ready for the reaction with an aldehyde,
and the catalyst also being partly bound to the molecular sieves,
probably by reversible coordination of hydrazine to the ruthenium
center.

To gain more insight into possible intermediates, we
investigated
the interaction between hydrazine and the dearomatized, unsaturated
complex 2 (Scheme 1), the latter being considered a key intermediate in the alcohol
dehydrogenation process. The addition of hydrazine hydrate (1 equiv)
to a freshly prepared solution of 2 in [d6]-benzene led to a color change from dark blue to yellow. 1H NMR spectroscopy showed a dramatic downfield shift of the
metal-hydride triplet signal from −25.76 ppm to −16.16
ppm, which is indicative of coordination trans to
the hydride ligand of 2. Since water addition to dearomatized
ruthenium pincer complexes is likely reversible,20,26 it is plausible that hydrazine coordinates to the metal center of 2. Such a complex derived from 2 and an amine
was previously observed for ammonia, and is consistent with the general
preference of electron-rich amines to coordinate via the lone electron
pair rather than undergo N–H bond activation.27 Broad 1H NMR signals that overlap the chemical
shift regions from 2.8 to 3.8 (CH2P and
=CHP) and from 5.3 to 6.4 ppm (Py-H3,5) but the presence of a sharp triplet at 6.51 ppm (Py-H4) indicates an equilibrium between the vinylic and benzylic
protons via a symmetric cationic intermediate, such as [2-N2H4]H+OH–, in
which the PNP ligand underwent protonation by water (Scheme 1). The appearance of sharp 13C{1H} NMR signals for C atoms, which are only
marginally affected by such an equilibrium, like Py-C4 (132.6 ppm) and Ru-CO (triplet at 209.2 ppm),
is consistent with this equilibrium. The 31P{1H} NMR spectrum showed a broad unsymmetrical splitting pattern at
78.4 and 81.8 ppm that also supports the existence of a dearomatized
coordination complex (for details, see the Supporting
Information (SI)).28 Such an equilibrium
might also occur under the catalytic conditions, the coordinated hydrazine
being eventually displaced by an alcohol, enabling the catalytic cycle.

Hydrate in Solution
[P] = P(tBu)2.

Surprisingly,
treating a solution of complex 2 and
hydrazine hydrate in benzene with molecular sieves (3 Å) resulted
in the formation of single crystals of a unique supramolecular compound.
The unit cell consists of eight [(tBuPNP)Ru(CO)H(N2H4)]+ cations (Figure 2) of the type [2-N2H4]H+ having an aromatized PNP ligand and coordinated
hydrazine. The coordinated hydrazine is part of a sophisticated hydrogen
bonding network, together with water molecules and a [Si8O20]8– cluster, which undoubtedly originated
from the molecular sieves (for structural details, including hydrogen
bond analysis, see the SI). Most likely,
the acidity of silanol groups led to protonation of the dearomatized
PNP complex [2-N2H4], resulting
in stabilization of the cationic complex [2-N2H4]H+ in the equilibrium of Scheme 1.29 The interesting crystal structure sheds more light on the molecular
conditions during the ruthenium-catalyzed azine synthesis and allows
for the conclusion that breaking hydrogen-bonded networks between
the highly protic reactants, most likely with surface siloxide groups
of molecular sieves being involved in hydrogen bonding, might be crucial
for releasing the catalyst and enabling the catalytic cycle. This
contrasts with imine formation by coupling of amines with alcohols,
which generates water as well, but does not require the use of molecular
sieves.20

Table 2 shows the
substrate scope of the new dehydrogenative coupling reaction of alcohols
and hydrazine under slightly basic conditions or in base-free versions
using complex 1. The reaction tolerates a variety of
substituent patterns of benzylic alcohols. The base-free method can
be performed with low catalyst loading (0.5 mol %) to obtain
good to high yields (Table 2, entries 1–8). For 3-(dimethylamino)benzyl (75% isolated
yield) and 4-methylbenzyl alcohol (70% isolated yield), the base-free
version led to significantly better results with lower amounts of
catalyst (see entries 3 and 5 in Table 2). The base-free variant also led to good results for
benzaldazine (78% yield; entry 6) and can be expanded to halogen-substituted
benzyl alcohols as well, as shown for the chloro derivative (entry
7), although in lower yield. The presence of strong electron-withdrawing
substituents such as CF3 or F in para position
resulted in very little conversion, forming (for CF3) a
mixture of products. Hexanaldazine was synthesized in good yield (70%),
demonstrating the applicability for aliphatic alcohols (see entry
8 in Table 2).

In summary,
we have developed a general synthetic method for the
preparation of symmetrical azines from alcohols and hydrazine hydrate
catalyzed by a ruthenium PNP complex in the presence of molecular
sieves, which can be performed without added base. This dehydrogenative
coupling reaction is an efficient way of forming N–N-linked
building blocks that can be used for a variety of subsequent transformations.
The use of molecular sieves (or γ-alumina) is essential. Hydrazine
is strongly bound to the molecular sieves, and an unusual ruthenium
complex bearing coordinated hydrazine hydrogen-bonded to a siloxane
cluster was isolated. Studies aimed at further mechanistic insights,
and synthetic applications of the hydrazine-based catalytic methodology,
are in progress.
