Coproheme
decarboxylase (ChdC) catalyzes the last step in the heme
biosynthesis pathway of monoderm bacteria with coproheme acting both
as redox cofactor and substrate. Hydrogen peroxide mediates the stepwise
decarboxylation of propionates 2 and 4 of coproheme. Here we present
the crystal structures of coproheme-loaded ChdC from Listeria monocytogenes (LmChdC) and the three-propionate
intermediate, for which the propionate at position 2 (p2) has been
converted to a vinyl group and is rotated by 90° compared to
the coproheme complex structure. Single, double, and triple mutants
of LmChdC, in which H-bonding interactions to propionates 2, 4, 6,
and 7 were eliminated, allowed us to obtain the assignment of the
coproheme propionates by resonance Raman spectroscopy and to follow
the H2O2-mediated conversion of coproheme to
heme b. Substitution of H2O2 by chlorite allowed us to monitor compound I formation in the inactive
Y147H variant which lacks the catalytically essential Y147. This residue
was demonstrated to be oxidized during turnover by using the spin-trap
2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane. Based on these findings and the data derived
from molecular dynamics simulations of cofactor structures in distinct
poses, we propose a reaction mechanism for the stepwise decarboxylation
of coproheme that includes a 90° rotation of the intermediate
three-propionate redox cofactor.

1 Introduction
Coproheme
decarboxylase (ChdC, formerly known as HemQ) catalyzes
the last step in the heme biosynthesis pathway of monoderm bacteria.1 Two propionate groups from iron coproporphyrin
III (coproheme) at positions 2 and 4 (p2, p4) are cleaved off to yield
a three-propionate intermediate (monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme)
and, finally, iron protoporphyrin IX (heme b).2−4 The reaction is mediated by hydrogen peroxide and needs two H2O2 molecules to transform one coproheme to heme b.5 Most interestingly, coproheme
acts as both substrate and redox cofactor. ChdC loaded with nickel
substituted coproheme is totally inactive and ChdC with manganese
substituted coproheme is inactive toward H2O2 but can be oxidized by peroxyacetic acid.2,6 Up
to now biochemical studies were performed on ChdCs from Firmicutes,
i.e. Staphylococcus aureus (SaChdC), Listeria monocytogenes (LmChdC), and Geobacillus stearothermophilus (GsChdC).5,7−10

Recently, DuBois and co-workers proposed a reaction mechanism
of
the decarboxylation reaction that involves a catalytic redox-active
tyrosine residue (Y147, LmChdC numbering). This conserved aromatic residue was proposed
to be oxidized by a (hypothetic) compound I [oxoiron(IV) Por•+] thereby producing compound I* [oxoiron(IV) •Y147],
which initiates the decarboxylation reactions of p2 and p4.6 Successively, transient formation of •Y147 was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.11 While the proposed mechanism of the first propionyl
decarboxylation (p2) is generally accepted (although experimental
evidence for compound I formation is missing), the second decarboxylation
reaction at the p4 position is still an open question. DuBois and
co-workers proposed that decarboxylation of p4 may involve residues
in the vicinity of p4, namely K151, W200, W159, and Y113 (LmChdC numbering).
However, substitution of any of these residues did not result in complete
loss of activity, the K151A mutant showed highly impaired reactivity
toward p4 oxidation, and almost no formation of heme b was detected.6,11 On the basis of these mutational
studies and in support of Y147 involvement in the decarboxylation
reactions of both p2 and p4, the possibility of a long (i.e., 10 Å)
range proton-coupled electron transfer from p4 to Y147 was discussed
with the three-propionate intermediate remaining in the same position
as the coproheme substrate.6 Since the
catalytic tyrosine was shown to be essential for both decarboxylation
reactions, a possible mechanism involving substrate reorientation
has been suggested recently.11

The
present work provides experimental evidence for the H2O2-mediated oxidation reaction of ferric LmChdC to compound
I together with the rotation of the three-propionate intermediate
by approximately 90° within the active site. This moves p4 to
the former position of p2 and, thus, to be in close proximity of catalytic
Y147 for initiation of the second decarboxylation cycle. Wild-type
LmChdC and mutated proteins were studied by a broad range of biochemical
and biophysical methods including X-ray crystallography, resonance
Raman (RR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV–vis stopped-flow
spectroscopy, and complemented by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
We present (i) kinetic and spectroscopic evidence of coproheme compound
I formation, (ii) identification of the Y147 radical by spin-trapping,
(iii) the assignment of the bending modes [δ(CβCcCd)] of all four propionyl substituents of
coproheme and the spectral transition to heme b mediated
by H2O2, (iv) the crystal structures of coproheme-LmChdC
and of monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme-LmChdC in the rotated
orientation, and, finally, (v) we propose a mechanism for decarboxylation
of coproheme and monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme.

2 Results
2.1 Crystal Structures of Coproheme-LmChdC and
Monovinyl, Monopropionate Deuteroheme-LmChdC in the Rotated Orientation
Coproheme decarboxylases have been shown to react with submicromolar
H2O2, which initiates the decarboxylation of
coproheme and thus provokes heterogeneity in the active site.11 Consequently, the first crystal structure of
coproheme-ChdC was obtained from catalytically inactive manganese-loaded
coproheme-GsChdC.6 Here, in order to obtain
the crystal structure of iron-coproporphyrin III-loaded LmChdC, we
inhibited residual enzymatic activity by addition of 5 mM cyanide
to the crystallization drop. Cyanide was diluted out of the crystals
prior to cryo-cooling with mother liquor. The crystals, grown in 0.1
M HEPES, pH 7.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, diffracted
to a resolution of 1.79 Å (6FXJ). The protein crystallizes as a pentamer
in space group P1211 with unit cell parameters
of 77.87 Å × 129.11 Å × 77.92 Å, almost identical
to previously solved structures (Table 1).5 The electron densities
of coproheme allowed us to assign three out of four propionates (p2,
p4, and p6) in chains A and D (Figure 1A). In general, the active site of coprohome-LmChdC
very closely resembled that of Mn-coproheme-GsChdC in the resting
state.6 In chains A and D, the entire subunit
could be modeled, since the flexible loop forming the active site
access channel is stabilized by crystal packing contacts, similar
to the previously solved structures of Firmicutes ChdCs (4WWS, 5LOQ, 5T2K).5,6,9 Electron densities for coproheme in the
other subunits (B, C, and E) were weak and do not allow to reliably
refine the cofactor’s coordinates (Figure 1A).

as well as conserved residues in the coproheme cavity including the

Analysis of the hydrogen bonding
interactions of the four propionate
groups in chains A and D reveals an extensive network spanning from
p2 to p4 (R220–water–p2–S225–p2–water–water–K151–p4)
(Figures 1B and 2). The propionate at position 6 (p6) is also stabilized
and coordinated by various H-bonds (water, R172, R179, R133, and A115)
in contrast to p7 (potentially H-bonded to R133 in chain D or Q187
in chain A), whose position is the most variable in all subunits.
The hydrogen bonding interactions of p2, p4, p6, and p7 of all subunits
are summarized in Table S1.

In the absence of cyanide
during crystallization, LmChdC exhibits
low activity even in the absence of exogenously added H2O2.12 Apparently, submicromolar
H2O2, which is always present in buffers under
aerobic conditions, can initiate decarboxylation of coproheme. During
initial studies we were not aware of this possible reaction, and in
the previously reported crystal structure (in 0.1 M bicine pH 9.0,
10% w/v PEG 6000; 1.69 Å; pdb code 5LOQ) of the redox cofactor-loaded LmChdC,5 we assigned p6 and p7 in analogy to heme b in chlorite dismutases, which share a similar fold.13,14 By contrast, p2 and p4 could not be resolved. Presently, based on
the structures of GsChdC complexed with manganese coproheme (5T2K)6 and of coproheme-LmChdC (6FXJ) obtained by the
approach described above, we revisited the data set of 5LOQ and built
a new model with two porphyrin species having occupancies of 50% each
(6FXQ). One species corresponds to iron coproporphyrin III in the
orientation of the structure described above (6FXJ). The second species
is an iron monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme rotated by 90°
compared to the coproheme of the structures 5T2K and 6FXJ, and, therefore,
in the orientation of the previously solved redox cofactor (5LOQ).
With this new model the refinement statistics have been improved (Table 1).

In the new
structural model (6FXQ) propionates p2 of coproheme
and p4 of monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme share the same region
in the active site and are H-bonded to S225 and R220 and close to
the catalytic tyrosine (Y147), whereas p4 of coproheme and p6 of the
three-propionate intermediate interact with K151 and Y113 (Figure 3). The densities
(in chains A, D, and E) at position 2 of the monovinyl, monopropionate
deuteroheme are clearly indicative of a vinyl group, rather than a
methyl or even propionate group. This suggests that in the absence
of cyanide (i) coproheme of LmChdC was partially converted to the
three-propionate intermediate during crystal growth by oxygen activation
and generation of hydrogen peroxide and (ii) that coproheme is present
in a different orientation compared to the monovinyl, monopropionate
deuteroheme. Both cofactors are 90° rotated with respect to each
other, which is in agreement with the hypothesis that the cofactor
rotates during decarboxylation and that both propionates are in close
vicinity to the catalytic Y147 residue, which is involved in the decarboxylation
reactions of both p2 and p4.

on two cofactors with occupancies of 50% each, i.e. coproporphyrin
III and rotated monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme. (A) Electron

2.2 Dynamics of H-bonding in
Coproheme-LmChdC
and Monovinyl, Monopropionate Deuteroheme-LmChdC
In order
to examine and compare the interactions of the two distinct binding
poses of coproheme and the three propionates intermediate in LmChdC,
we simulated both coproheme and monovinyl, monopropionyl deuteroheme
with their p2/v2 and p4 propionates oriented toward catalytic Tyr147.
The initial binding poses are summarized in Figure 4. Coproheme in pose 0 reflects the correct
binding of the substrate/redox cofactor in LmChdC (6FXJ) as reported
in Figure 1.

Figure 4 Snapshots of
the initial binding poses of coproheme and monovinyl,
monopropionyl deuteroheme. Coproheme in pose 0 reflects the correct
binding of the substrate/redox cofactor in LmChdC (6FXJ) as reported
in Figure 1. Monovinyl,
monopropionyl deuteroheme in pose 90 corresponds to the intermediate
structure proposed to be responsible for decarboxylation of p4. The
Cβ atom of p2 is shown as a sphere.

Simulation of one pentamer comprises five redox cofactors
bound
to the five monomers, which provides good statistics, comparable to
five separate monomer replicas. Table 2 summarizes the percentage of simulation time during
which oxygens of propionates form H-bonds to amino acids of the active
site. The highest hydrogen bonding frequency is observed between p2
and Tyr147 in coproheme in pose 0 (98% present during simulation).
In this simulation p2 forms further H-bonds with Ser225 (95% of simulation
time) and Phe231 (57%), thus being the strongest interacting propionate
in all simulations (forming on average 2.5 hydrogen bonds). Coproheme
in pose 90 shows the highest number of hydrogen bonds per cofactor
with the highest contribution originating from p7 that interacts with
Leu114, Ser116, and Ala115.

a The most frequently
formed hydrogen
bonds are in green, hydrogen bonds formed for more than 50% of the
time are in bold. The p2 propionates do not exist in the three-propionate
intermediate, thus the columns are in grey.

In the simulations of monovinyl, monopropionyl deuteroheme
in pose
90 (i.e., rotated orientation), p4 forms more than two hydrogen bonds
for 100% of the simulation time, including H-bonding with Tyr147 (74%
of simulation time). On the other hand, in the simulations of monovinyl,
monopropionyl deuteroheme in pose 0 a strong H-bond is established
between p4 and Lys151 (94%). Overall, monovinyl, monopropionyl deuteroheme
in pose 90 with p4 oriented toward Tyr147 forms more than twice as
many H-bonds as coproheme in pose 0 with p2 being oriented toward
Tyr147. This is a consequence of the strong hydrogen bonding interactions
of p6 and p7 in the monovinyl, monopropionyl deuteroheme in pose 90.

Furthermore, we evaluated the probability of electron transfer
to Tyr147 from the Cβ atom of propionates using Dijkstra’s
graph search algorithm (Table S2).15−17Figure 5 depicts
the predicted electron transfer pathways. Since p2 is the first propionate
to be cleaved off, there is a more than 118 times higher probability
of electron transfer to Tyr147 if coproheme is in pose 0 compared
to coproheme in pose 90. In the case of monovinyl, monopropionyl deuteroheme,
the probability of electron transfer to Tyr147 from the Cβ atom
of p4 (involving 4 atoms) is 230 times higher in pose 90 compared
to pose 0 (transfer via 13 atoms).

p2 and p4 to Y147 for
coproheme in poses 0 and 90 as well as from p4 to Y147 in monovinyl,

2.3 Reaction of Coproheme-LmChdC with H2O2 and Chlorite—Formation of Compound I and of
the Y147 Radical
Upon addition of hydrogen peroxide to coproheme-LmChdC,
decarboxylation of p2 and p4 leads to the formation of heme b-LmChdC. During this reaction the original electronic absorption
spectrum of coproheme-LmChdC (Soret maximum: 393 nm) converts to a
spectrum with the characteristics of heme b-LmChdC
(Soret maximum: 410 nm). The reaction is slow, and the turnover number
and kcat/KM values were determined to be ∼0.0065 s–1 and 1.8 × 102 M–1 s–1 at pH 7.5

Hydrogen peroxide mediates
the two-electron oxidation of ferric ChdC to a postulated (coproheme)
compound I [oxoiron(IV) Por•+]6,11 which
has not been trapped spectrophotometrically, most probably because
of its fast conversion to compound I* [oxoiron(IV) Y147•]. Substitution of Y147 with alanine or histidine completely inactivates LmChdC (Figure 7C). Nevertheless,
it was not possible to follow compound I formation by stopped-flow
spectroscopy upon mixing of Y147A or Y147H with H2O2, most probably because of a decrease of in conformational
stability and a structural rearrangement of the active site of those
mutants, which impairs compound I formation by H2O2.18 At high excess of hydrogen
peroxide bleaching of coproheme was observed in Y147A and Y147H.

Other variant proteins (Y113A, R133A, M149A, K151A, R179A, Q187A,
Y113A/K151A, M149A/Q187A, Y147A/R220A/S225A) were examined to assess
the reaction with H2O2, but with the exception
of K151A, Y147A, and Y147H, they had wild-type like catalytic activity.
However, compound I formation was not observed for any. Most of these
amino acids are involved in the extended H-bonding network of LmChdC
involving the propionates p2, p4, p6, and p7 of coproheme.18

As it is known that chlorite also acts
as a two-electron oxidant
of heme proteins and mediates compound I formation similar to H2O2,19−21 we tested whether chlorite is able to initiate the
decarboxylation reaction of coproheme. Thus, we performed titrations
analogous to the previously reported experiments using H2O2.5 Interestingly, the spectral
transitions of wild-type coproheme-LmChdC to heme b-LmChdC triggered by chlorite are identical to those mediated by
H2O2 (Figure S1A).
Moreover, the stoichiometry of the reaction is identical.5 Plotting the normalized absorbance at 410 nm
against the ratio of [chlorite]/[LmChdC] and fitting with a sigmoidal
function, a midpoint of conversion at a [chlorite]/[LmChdC] ratio
between 0.67 and 0.69 has been found. A 2-fold stoichiometric excess
of chlorite or H2O2 is needed for completion
of the conversion of coproheme to heme b. These findings
support the proposed reaction mechanism that starts with the two-electron
oxidation of ferric ChdC to compound I by either H2O2 or chlorite.

We also probed whether it is possible
to monitor compound I formation
of wild-type and mutant proteins mediated by chlorite. Neither mixing
of wild-type LmChdC nor Y147A with chlorite gave reliable spectral
and kinetic data. However, the variant Y147H allowed us to follow
compound I formation spectrophotometrically at pH 7.0 (Figure 6A). Upon mixing of Y147H with
chlorite, hypochromicity in the Soret region was observed with clear
isosbestic points at 344, 425, 450, and 544 nm. Single wavelength
measurements at the Soret maximum of coproheme were monophasic (for
the first 0.5 s) and could be fitted by a single exponential function
(Figure 6B). A pure
compound I spectrum could not be observed due to a competing reaction,
as evident from the relatively high intercept (2.5 s–1). The competing reaction was identified as heme bleaching, due to
pseudo-first-order conditions, as becomes evident when the reaction
was followed for a longer time period (Figure S2). The linear dependence of kobs as a function of chlorite concentration enabled the apparent bimolecular
rate constant for compound I formation to be calculated, 1.2 ×
104 M–1 s–1 at pH 7.0
(Figure 6C). Simulation
of the data using the Pro-Kineticist software (Applied Photophysics)
allowed calculating the coproheme compound I spectrum of Y147H with
absorbance maxima at 391, 544, 583, and 645 nm (Figure 6D).

A using Pro-K software and calculation of the spectrum of compound

Compound I of LmChdC is rapidly
converted to compound I* with the
proposed formation of a catalytic tyrosyl radical (Y147•). In order to prove the existence of Y147• during
turnover of LmChdC, we used the spin trap 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane
(MNP), which is known to specifically attack and modify tyrosyl radicals
yielding 3-nitrotyrosine.22 Coproheme-LmChdC
was treated with a large excess (83-fold) of hydrogen peroxide in
the presence of MNP and was analyzed by mass spectrometry. LmChdC
has 12 tyrosine residues (Figure 7). Upon mixing of coproheme-LmChdC
with MNP in the absence of hydrogen peroxide, no modification of the
tyrosine residues could be detected by mass spectrometry. In the presence
of H2O2, only two out of the 12 tyrosine residues
were modified by more than 1% (Figure 7A). Table 3 summarizes these data together with the calculated accessible
surface areas of all tyrosines in LmChdC [Å2, using
the WHATIF server, based on the crystal structure for LmChdC (6FXJ)].
The predicted catalytic Y147, which is not surface accessible, is
modified by 56.04% and Y135 modified by 15.6%. The latter is located
on the flexible loop at the access channel to the active site (Figure 7B).

2.4 Assignment
of Propionyl Bands of Coproheme
and Monitoring of the Conversion of Coproheme to Heme b by Resonance Raman Spectroscopy
The bending modes [δ(CβCcCd)] of propionate substituents
are usually found in the low frequency region of the resonance Raman
(RR) spectrum between 366 and 376 cm–1. The frequencies
correlate to the H-bond strength between the propionate and the nearby
amino acids. Typically, the higher the number and the strength of
the H-bonds, the higher the bending frequency and vice versa.23 With the objective of assigning the four propionate
bands of wild-type coproheme LmChdC, we analyzed the RR spectra of
a series of mutants where the residues H-bonded with p2 (Y147, R220,
and S225), p4 (Y113 and K151, the latter is also part of a H-bond
network involving p2), p6 (R133 and R179, the latter is also H-bonded
to the p7), and p7 (Q187) were replaced with alanine. As compared
to the wild-type protein, decreasing of the H-bond strength is expected
to result in a frequency downshift of the corresponding RR bending
mode. However, as a consequence of the inhomogeneity of the H-bonds
between the propionyls and residues in the five subunits (see Table S2) and the very extensive H-bond network
spanning from p2 to p4 (see Figure 2A and B), it is impossible to predict the net effect
on the frequency of each propionyl bending mode induced by the single,
double, and triple mutation. Therefore, due to the inhomogeneous broadening
following the loss of H-bonding interactions in the mutants and the
severe overlapping of their frequencies, the assignment of the propionyl
bending modes of the mutants involved in the H-bond interaction with
p2 and p4 is less clear.

In the RR spectrum of wild-type coproheme-LmChdC
at room temperature, only three propionate bending modes at 374, around
381 and 392 cm–1, can be observed (Figure 8). In the complex of coproheme
with the Y147A/R220A/S225A triple mutant a new band at 386 cm–1 can be identified (Figure 8, beige). This mutant lacks the H-bond interaction
with the propionate group in position 2 (Figure 2 and Table 2). Therefore, this new band is tentatively assigned
to the bending mode of a non-H-bonded p2, which in the wild-type protein
is expected to have a higher frequency. Accordingly, an intensity
increase in this region is also observed in the spectra of the coproheme
mutants where the K151 residues interacting with propionate in position
2 have been replaced with Ala.

Figure 8 Comparison of resonance Raman spectra
in the low frequency region
of the coproheme-LmChdC complexes of the WT and mutants obtained at
298 K (λexc 406.7 nm). The bands tentatively assigned
to the bending modes δ(CβCcCd) of the propionate groups in position 2, 4, 6, and 7 are
reported in beige, green, brown, and light blue, respectively. Accordingly,
the label color of the mutants indicates the propionate group with
which the mutated residues interact. In magenta the band corresponding
to the 6cLS (six-coordinate low spin) species is depicted. The spectrum
of wild-type coproheme-LmChdC is reported in red. The spectra have
been shifted along the ordinate axis to allow better visualization.
Experimental conditions: laser power at the sample 5 mW, average of
8 spectra with a 80 min integration time (Q187A); average of 12 spectra
with a 120 min integration time (M149A/Q187A); average of 10 spectra
with a 100 min integration time (R179A and R133A); average of 15 spectra
with 150 min integration time (WT); average of 9 spectra with a 90
min integration time (Y113A, M149A, and K151A); average of 12 spectra
with a 120 min integration time (Y113A/K151A and Y147A/R220A/S225A).

In the coproheme-Y113A complex,
which lacks the H-bond interaction
with the propionate in position 4 (Table 3), the band at 381 cm–1 (WT) downshifts to 379 cm–1 and increases in intensity
(Figure 8, green).
Consequently, this band is assigned to the bending mode of p4. Propionate
in position 6 is directly H-bonded to R179 and, via a water molecule,
to R133 (Table S1). In the coproheme-R179A
complex the band at 374 cm–1 (wild-type LmChdC)
unexpectedly upshifts to 377 cm–1 (Figure 8, brown), suggesting that a
strengthening of the H-bond interactions occurs after mutation. By
contrast, the frequency is unchanged in the coproheme-R133A complex
spectrum.

The mutant Q187A involves a residue which interacts
only with p7
(Table 3). In its coproheme
complex the band at 392 cm–1 (wild-type LmChdC)
downshifts to 389 cm–1(Figure 8, light blue) and is, therefore, assigned
to the p7 bending mode. The spectrum of the coproheme-M149A/Q187A
double mutant complex is roughly an average of the coproheme-M149A
and coproheme-Q187A spectra.

Based on these findings the three
propionate bending modes of wild-type
coproheme-LmChdC at room temperature can be assigned to p6 (374 cm–1), p4 (381 cm–1), and p7 (392 cm–1). As noted above, the corresponding bending of p2
is expected at a frequency higher than 386 cm–1.
It has to be noted that a new band at 412 cm–1 (in
the region of the vinyl bending modes) appears in the spectra of the
coproheme-Y147A/R220A/S225A, coproheme-Y113A/K151A, and coproheme-K151A
complexes which are mainly a 6cLS (six-coordinate low spin) form (data
not shown). Since these species are catalytically inactive (see above),
they cannot form a heme b complex, and consequently
no band due to vinyl bending modes is expected. Therefore, the origin
of the band at 412 cm–1, which appears only in the
6cLS complex spectra, remains unclear.

In order to increase
the spectral resolution, we performed RR measurements
at 80 K, since the band widths decrease as the temperature is lowered.
As reported in the Experimental Section, the experiments have been obtained with the 413.1 nm excitation
to avoid the plasma lines of the 406.7 nm excitation wavelength in
the low frequency region. At 80 K, the wild-type LmChdC spectrum shows
four well-defined bands at 374, 383, 389, and 399 cm–1 (Figure 9). However,
unlike the wild-type protein, no clear assignment of the propionyls
in the mutant proteins could be obtained at 80 K. The spectra showed
multiple changes induced by the temperature. First, as previously
found, heme proteins undergo a temperature-induced transition from
high to low spin.24−27 At low temperature the amount of 6cLS increases and becomes the
main species (Figure S3). As a consequence,
the band at 414 cm–1 becomes very strong and is
also observed in the coproheme complexes of M149A, Y113A, R179A, and
R133A (Figure S4). Moreover, an upshift
of the p2 bending mode is observed in those mutants involved in the
extensive H-bond network spanning from p4 to p2 suggesting a strengthening
of the H-bond interaction induced by the low temperature.

Figure 9 Comparison
of resonance Raman spectra in the low frequency region
of wild-type coproheme-LmChdC and wild-type heme b-LmChdC obtained at 298 K (λexc 406.7 nm) and at
80 K (λexc 413.1 nm). The bands tentatively assigned
to the bending modes δ(CβCcCd) of the propionate groups in positions 2, 4, 6, and 7 are
reported in beige, green, brown, and light blue, respectively. The
bending modes δ(CβCaCb) of the vinyl groups are also shown. The spectra have been shifted
along the ordinate axis to allow better visualization. Experimental
conditions: laser power at the sample 5 mW, average of 15 spectra
with 150 min integration time (298 K), and laser power at the sample
10 mW, average of 5 spectra with 100 min integration time (80 K).

The assignment of the bending
modes of the propionates in positions
6 and 7 is also confirmed by the spectra of the heme b complexes. In fact, upon conversion of coproheme into heme b, the propionate groups in positions 2 and 4 are decarboxylated
into vinyl groups, leaving only the propionates in positions 6 and
7. At room temperature, in wild-type heme b-LmChdC
the two bands at 378 and 392 cm–1 are due to the
[δ(CβCcCd)] propionate
bending modes. The broad band centered at 418 cm–1 derives from the two overlapping [δ(CβCaCb)] vinyl bending modes. The presence of two vinyl
bending modes, collapsed into one broad band, is confirmed by the
presence of two vinyl stretching modes at 1621 and 1632 cm–1 in the RR high frequency region spectrum at 298 K (Figure 10, red spectrum).

an unknown N-residue as the sixth ligand, and those in orange show
a minor 5cHS (five-coordinate high spin) species. The mutant label
colors beige, green, brown, and light blue indicate the positions
2, 4, 6, and 7, respectively, of the propionate groups with which
the mutated residues interact. The spectrum of the wild-type heme b complex is reported in red. The spectra have been shifted
along the ordinate axis to allow better visualization. Experimental
conditions: laser power at the sample 5–10 mW, average of 13
spectra with 130 min integration time (Q187A); average of 7 spectra
with 70 min integration time (R179A); average of 6 spectra with 120
min integration time (R133A); average of 6 spectra with a 30 min integration
time (wild-type); average of 5 spectra with 50 min integration time
(Y113A); average of 10 spectra with 100 min integration time (M149A).

As compared to the wild-type coproheme-complex,
the p6 frequency
of wild-type heme b-LmChdC is 4 cm–1 upshifted, suggesting altered surroundings that cause a strengthening
of the hydrogen bonding to p6. By contrast, the frequency of p7 remains
unchanged. As previously observed for wild-type coproheme LmChdC,
lowering the temperature does not affect the p6 frequency of heme b-LmChdC (which remains at 378 cm–1) whereas
it causes a ∼ 7 cm–1 upshift of the p7 band
(from 392 to 399 cm–1).

The frequencies (cm–1) and assignments of the
propionate [δ(CβCcCd)]
bending modes obtained at 298 and 80 K for the WT are reported in Table 4.

the frequencies observed
at 80 K for the WT are reported. The color coding of the four propionate
groups corresponds to that used in the RR figures.

Figure 11 compares
the heme b RR spectra of wild-type LmChdC and selected
mutants obtained at 298 (left) and 80 K (right). At room temperature,
the propionate bands of heme b-M149A are unaffected
by mutation, as expected, while the vinyl bending modes are centered
at 415 cm–1, 3 cm–1 downshifted
compared to the wild-type protein. In the heme b-R179A
and heme b-R133A spectra a 4 cm–1 upshift of the p6 band from 378 (wild-type) to 382 cm–1 is observed, similarly to the coproheme-R179A complex [where the
band upshifts 3 cm–1, from 374 (wild-type) to 377
cm–1], while a 2 cm–1 downshift
is observed in the frequency of p7 in both heme b-R179A and heme b-Q187A spectra. At low temperature,
the vinyl bending modes are observed at 417 cm–1 (414 cm–1 in the heme b-M149A)
and at about 407 cm–1. Unfortunately, due to the
very high fluorescence background we were unable to collect the RR
spectra in the high frequency region at 80 K, but the stretching modes
at 1621 and 1632 cm–1 observed in the RR spectra
at 298 K (Figure 10) are consistent with the bending modes at 407 and 417 cm–1, respectively.28,29

the bending modes δ(CβCcCd) of the propionate groups in positions 6 and 7 are reported in brown
and light blue, respectively. Accordingly, the mutant label colors
beige, green, brown, and light blue indicate the positions 2, 4, 6,
and 7, respectively, of the propionate group/s with which the mutated
residues interact. The bending modes δ(CβCaCb) of the vinyl groups are also shown. The spectrum
of the heme b-WT complex is reported in red. The
spectra have been shifted along the ordinate axis to allow better
visualization. Experimental conditions: (298 K) laser power at the
sample 5–10 mW, average of 13 spectra with a 130 min integration
time (Q187A); average of 10 spectra with a 200 min integration time
(R179A); average of 9 spectra with a 180 min integration time (R133A);
average of 4 spectra with 40 min integration time (WT); average of
4 spectra with a 80 min integration time (Y113A); average of 12 spectra
with a 120 min integration time (M149A). (80 K) laser power at the
sample 10 mW, average of 9 spectra with a 180 min integration time
(Q187A, R179A and Y113A); average of 10 spectra with a 200 min integration
time (R133A); average of 16 spectra with 320 min integration time
(WT); average of 6 spectra with a 120 min integration time (M149A).

Finally, in order to obtain better
insight into the catalytic mechanism,
we followed the conversion of coproheme into heme b by titrating the coproheme-M149A complex with hydrogen peroxide.
We performed the titration with this mutant, because the coproheme-M149A
complex is much less fluorescent than that of the wild-type protein,
thus allowing better resolution of the propionate bands. Moreover,
the heme b-M149A and heme b-wild-type
protein spectra are identical in the propionate region, the only difference
being the frequency of the broad vinyl band, as described above.

Figures 12 and 13 show the titration of coproheme-M149A with hydrogen
peroxide followed by UV–vis (298 K) and RR (80 K) spectroscopy.
Initially, the addition of hydrogen peroxide causes a decrease of
the 6cLS species of the coproheme complex, as indicated by the decrease
of the Soret band at 406 nm in the second derivative spectrum and
the blue shift of the maximum in the UV–vis spectrum (Figure 12, spectra a, b).
In spectrum c the 6cLS species of the heme b complex
becomes clearly evident by the red shift of the Soret maximum from
396 to 401 nm and the increase of a band at 407 nm in the D2 spectrum. This species increases as the titration proceeds leading
to a red-shift of the Soret band until reaching its final form, characterized
by a Soret band at 411 nm (412 in the D2 spectrum). The
apparent lack of a spectrum representing the three-propionate intermediate
is in agreement with previously published titrations, which were followed
by both UV–vis spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.5 This is probably due to the overlap of the isosbestic
point and the maximum of the Soret band of the three-propionate intermediate
which is at 398 nm.4

6cLS of the heme b complex are indicated in olive

shifted along the ordinate axis to allow better visualization. The

δ(CβCcCd) of the propionate

Experimental conditions: laser power at the sample 10 mW, average

As previously discussed (Figure 9), a distinctive
difference between the coproheme and
heme b complexes is the p6 band frequency, which
upshifts from 374 cm–1 (coproheme complex) to 378
cm–1 (heme b complex). The formation
of the heme b band is clearly observed during the
titration, since addition of hydrogen peroxide to the coproheme-M149A
complex causes a progressive broadening of the band at 374 cm–1(Figure 13, spectra b–d), with the concomitant decrease of the
p2 band at 394 cm–1. Conversely, the p7 band at
399 cm–1 does not change. Due to the upshift of
the p6 band, it is impossible to follow the disappearance of the p4
band at 383 cm–1. The formation of two vinyls highlighted
by the appearance of the two bending modes at 407 and 414 cm–1 is clearly observed.

3 Discussion
To date
only one crystal structure (5LOQ) has been available of
an iron coproporphyrin III (coproheme)-bound coproheme decarboxylase,
namely from Listeria monocytogenes (LmChdC).5 Only two out of the four propionate groups of
coproheme in chains A and D showed clear electron densities, whereas
the other two positions were unresolved and, therefore, presumed to
be highly flexible. A second structure of a manganese coproporphyrin
III from GsChdC,6 which is unreactive toward
hydrogen peroxide,12 was solved (5T2K) showing a different
(i.e., 90° rotated) orientation of coproheme and clear electron
densities for the propionates.6 Coproheme
can be slowly converted to the three propionate intermediate and further
to heme b by oxygen activation.12 Thus, we revisited the structure of coproheme-LmChdC (5LOQ)
and solved the crystal structure of the inactive (cyanide-blocked)
resting state (6FXJ). The active site architecture of the structure
(Figure 1) is very
similar to that of manganese coproheme-GsChdC, allowing us to resolve
the propionyls p2, p4, and p6.

Based on presently available
knowledge, it is very likely that,
in the absence of cyanide, coproheme in the previously reported structure
of LmChdC (5LOQ) was partially converted to the three-propionate intermediate,
containing, therefore, p2 partially decarboxylated to a vinyl substituent.
On this basis, we built a new and improved model (6FXQ) from the 5LOQ
data containing both coproheme and the three-propionate intermediate
(monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme). We performed further refinement,
resulting in better statistics (Table 1). The active site in the new model (6FXQ) is characterized
by two porphyrin species having occupancies of 50% each: coproheme
in the resting state orientation [corresponding to the newly solved
coproheme-LmChdC structure (6FXJ)] and the three propionate intermediate
being rotated by 90°, thus bringing p4 in close proximity to
the catalytic Y147. Such an orientation eliminates the need for (i)
a (postulated) long-range electron transfer from p4 in its original
position to Y147 and (ii) the presence of a second reaction site within
the same cavity. Generally, enzymes with two active sites usually
have regulatory tasks and catalyze reverse or consecutive reactions.30−32 Several FAD-dependent enzymes (e.g., pyranose dehydrogenase) were
proposed to have two His residues at the active site that both act
as general bases in the reductive half reaction, but later this was
demonstrated to be wrong.33−35 The hypothesis of two general
bases was intriguing in the case of pyranose dehydrogenase, which
oxidizes various mono- and oligosaccharides at different positions
(C1 and C4). The observed substrate specificity was subsequently explained
by reorientation/rotation of the substrate itself.33 Similar substrate dynamics were described for the enzyme
pectin methylesterase.36

Scheme 1 depicts
the rotation of the redox cofactor after the first decarboxylation
step underlining the role of Y147 in LmChdC as the only site of decarboxylation
for both p2 and p4, as also supported by recently published spectroscopic
studies.11Scheme 1 nicely demonstrates how during turnover
(i.e., conversion of coproheme to heme b) the surroundings
of the (remaining) propionates change with alteration of the H-bonding
partner. The proposed rotation of the three-propionate cofactor is
also supported by analysis of the dynamics of H-bonding interactions
of both coproheme and the three-propionate intermediate in different
poses. MD simulations suggest that the monovinyl, monopropionyl deuteroheme
with p4 close to Y147 forms more than twice as many H-bonds compared
to the unrotated orientation. Moreover, the probability of electron
transfer from Cβ of p4 to the terminal oxygen of Y147 is shown
to be 230 times higher when p4 is in the rotated orientation and thus
close to Y147.

Scheme 1 Orientations and Surroundings of Coproheme, Three-Propionate
Intermediate,
and Heme b of LmChdC during the Whole Reaction Cycle
The first decarboxylation
step is initiated by oxidation of ferric coproheme-LmChdC by hydrogen
peroxide. Propionate at position 2 is decarboxylated, and the resulting
three-propionate intermediate is rotated by 90°, thereby bringing
p4 close to Y147. A second hydrogen peroxide molecule is necessary
for decarboxylation of p4. The scheme also depicts the H-bonding interactions
of coproheme in the resting state as well as of the three-propionate
intermediate in the rotated orientation.

Scheme 1 is also
supported by the RR studies. We analyzed the RR spectra of wild-type
coproheme-LmChdC and heme b-LmChdC and a series of
mutants where the residues H-bonded with p2/v2, p4/v4, p6, and p7
were replaced with alanine. The bending modes of all four propionyl
substituents of coproheme and v2, v4, p6, and p7 in heme b have been assigned (Table 4), and we were able to follow the spectral transition of coproheme
to heme b mediated by hydrogen peroxide. The data
clearly show that the p6 frequency (present in both coproheme and
heme b) upshifts by 4 cm–1 in heme b-LmChdC as compared to coproheme-LmChdC, suggesting a change
in the H-bonding interaction with the residues in the heme cavity
as compared to the coproheme complex. Inspection of the 6FXJ structure
and Scheme 1 shows
that p6 in the rotated orientation interacts with the Y113 and K151
residues, similar to p4 in coproheme-LmChdC (whose bending mode is
assigned to the band at 381 cm–1). The p7 frequency
in coproheme-LmChdC and heme b-LmChdC is identical,
which reflects the solvent exposure of p7 in the (coproheme) resting
state and the (three-propionate) rotated orientation (Table S3).

The question of whether the
monovinyl intermediate stays bound
and rotates within the active site or whether it is released after
the first decarboxylation and rebinds in a different orientation remains
unanswered. The active site volume would allow a rotation in the bound
state, but there are also indications favoring the release-and-rebinding
mechanism. During the enzymatic reaction significantly greater than
stoichiometric amounts of the three-propionate intermediates were
detected in previous studies.2,37 This would only be
possible if the substrate is released after the first decarboxylation.

Complete conversion of coproheme to heme b requires
two hydrogen peroxide molecules. Except for Y147A and K151A, all LmChdC
variants exhibit a wild-type-like catalytic activity.18 During decarboxylation of the first propionate substituent,
H2O2 oxidizes coproheme-LmChdC to compound I
[oxoiron(IV) Por•+], which rapidly converts to compound
I* [oxoiron(IV) •Y147]. This species attacks the
Cβ atom of the corresponding propionate. Upon using the spin
trap MNP, we could clearly demonstrate that Y147 is catalytically
essential and oxidized during turnover, which fully supports data
from SaChdC and the role of homologous Y145.6 This also further suggests that this mechanism is valid for the
entire Clade 1 of ChdCs.12

Upon elimination
of Y147, which renders LmChdC completely inactive,
the conversion of compound I to compound I* is suppressed. Moreover,
we demonstrated that chlorite is a better two-electron oxidant of
LmChdC compared to H2O2, and mediated rapid
decarboxylation of coproheme (Figure S1). By using chlorite as oxidant we were able to trap the compound
I state of LmChdC and succeeded in monitoring the conversion of ferric
coproheme-Y147H to the coproheme compound I state. For the first time
the kinetics of formation and the spectral signatures of a coproheme
compound I could be monitored.

Compound I formation of ChdC
must be the rate-limiting step during
turnover since the hydrophobic distal cavity lacks a base for deprotonation
of H2O2. This is consistent with the solvent
deuterium isotope effect on the reaction rate of ChdC with H2O2.7 By contrast, ClO2– is always deprotonated under reaction conditions
due to its low pKa value and rapidly binds
to ferric coproheme. Nevertheless, chlorite is definitely not present
in the physiological environment and can be excluded as the natural
oxidant for ChdCs. Hydrogen peroxide is always available in biological
fluids, but its reactivity with ChdCs is rather low and inefficient.
Consequently, ChdCs are prone to heme bleaching in the presence of
excess hydrogen peroxide.5,12 We have recently shown
that promotion of a closed conformation of LmChdC is triggered by
the distal mobile Q187. This could play an important role in compound
I formation.10,18 Upon disrupting the H-bonding
network between p2 and p4 or elimination of Q187, formation of an
open conformation has been observed and catalytic activity was diminished.10

In summary, by combining our data with
that of the literature a
consensus reaction mechanism for decarboxylation of coproheme by ChdCs
can be proposed (Scheme 2). Upon reaction with chlorite/H2O2, a coproheme-compound
I [oxoiron(IV) Por•+] is formed and oxidizes Y147
to yield a tyrosyl radical [compound I*, i.e oxoiron(IV) •Y147]. The tyrosyl radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom (H•) from the β-carbon of p2, followed by migration
of the unpaired propionyl electron to the redox cofactor and reduction
of the oxoiron(IV) species to the ferric state. Concomitantly the
substituent is stabilized by elimination of carbon dioxide thereby
forming the vinyl substituent at position 2.

Scheme 2 Molecular Radical
Mechanism of Coproheme Decarboxylation in ChdC
Oxidation of ferric coproheme
ChdC by hydrogen peroxide or chlorite forms compound I [oxoiron(IV)
Por●+] which is rapidly converted to compound I*
[oxoiron(IV) ●Y147]. The tyrosyl radical attacks
Cβ of the propionate at position 2 (p2) and abstracts a hydrogen
atom (H●). Migration of the formed unpaired propionyl
electron to the redox cofactor forms the ferric state, whereas the
substituent is stabilized by elimination of carbon dioxide thereby
forming the vinyl substituent at position 2. After p2 decarboxylation,
the three propionate intermediate is rotated by 90° forming a
monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme-compound I, and subsequently,
compound I* is formed by a second H2O2 molecule
(Schemes 1 and 2). The ●Y147 radical now attacks
p4 following the same sequence of reactions.

After decarboxylation of p2, the three propionate intermediate
is rotated by 90° and a monovinyl, monopropionate deuteroheme-compound
I and compound I* is formed by a second H2O2 molecule (Schemes 1 and 2). Subsequently, p4 is attacked by •Y147 and the second decarboxylation reaction follows
the same sequence as described above (Scheme 2). The extensive hydrogen bonding network
of p2 and p4 supports the proposed mechanism including the rotation
of the cofactor after the first decarboxylation step. Upon elimination
of K151 LmChdC is almost completely inactive. The crystal structures
of coproheme-LmChdC and the three-propionate intermediate clearly
demonstrate that K151 plays an important role in stabilizing both
coproheme and the three-propionate intermediate. It provides H-bonding
to p2 (via two waters) and p4 of coproheme, but it also stabilizes
p4 and p6 in the (rotated) intermediate structure. The RR data of
heme b-LmChdC have clearly shown that p6 in heme b-LmChdC makes stronger H-bonding interactions compared
to p6 in the coproheme form, thus supporting the proposed mechanism.
Unfortunately, the crystal structure of a heme b-ChdC
is still missing, but crystallization trials with ChdCs from various
organisms are in progress.
