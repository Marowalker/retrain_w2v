The
adenylation (A) domain acts as the first “gate-keeper”
to ensure the activation and thioesterification of the correct monomer
to nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Our understanding of
the specificity-conferring code and our ability to engineer A domains
are critical for increasing the chemical diversity of nonribosomal
peptides (NRPs). We recently discovered a novel NRPS-like protein
(ATEG_03630) that can activate 5-methyl orsellinic acid (5-MOA) and
reduce it to 2,4-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethyl benzaldehyde. A NRPS-like
protein is much smaller than multidomain NRPSs, but it still represents
the thioesterification half-reaction, which is otherwise missed from
a stand-alone A domain. Therefore, a NRPS-like protein may serve as
a better model system for A domain engineering. Here, we characterize
the substrate specificity of ATEG_03630 and conclude that the hydrogen-bond
donor at the 4-position is crucial for substrate recognition. Next,
we show that the substrate specificity of ATEG_03630 can be engineered
toward our target substrate anthranilate via bioinformatics analysis
and mutagenesis. The resultant mutant H358A increased its activity
toward anthranilate by 10.9-fold, which led to a 26-fold improvement
in specificity. Finally, we demonstrate one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis
of 4-hydroxybenzaldoxime from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid with high yield.

Introduction
Nonribosomal peptides
(NRPs), such as antitumor agent bleomycin
and antibiotic vancomycin, are an important group of secondary metabolites.
They are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs),
megaenzymes that consist of multiple modules.1 Each module is usually responsible for activation, modification,
and incorporation of a specific monomer into the NRP product. The
adenylation (A) domain acts as the first “gate-keeper”
to ensure the activation and thioesterification of the correct monomer
to the assembly line. Although A domains typically have high specificity,
the occasional promiscuity of certain A domains is a known source
of congeners of NRPs,2 which diversify
the chemical structures of NRPs as a potential way to hedge against
resistance. In light of that, researchers have been developing different
approaches to artificially increase the chemical diversity of NRPs
by changing the substrate specificity of A domains.

The first
approach is domain-swapping,3,4 which
is achieved via replacing the original A-ACP didomains with heterologous
A-ACP domains. However, initially, the success of this approach was
quite limited due to the complex nature of domain–domain interactions,
which may involve complicated conformational changes of the megaenzymes.
Later, significant improvements were made through better understanding
of the domain–domain communication5 and the identification and engineering of important linker regions.6 Nonetheless, the domain-swapping method is still
far from optimal.

The second approach involves mutating important
code-conferring
residues7,8 to alter the substrate specificity of the
A domains.1 Numerous A domains have been
engineered to incorporate nonnatural substrates into the NRP products.9,10 In addition, directed evolution11−13 and computational redesign14 have been used to engineer the substrate specificity
of the A domains. However, most of the previous engineering works
focused on proteinogenic amino acids. On the contrary, one of the
hallmarks and significant advantages of NRPSs is their ability to
incorporate nonproteinogenic amino acids,15 which exponentially increases the chemical complexity of NRPs.

Aryl acids are an important class of monomers of NRPs. Aryl acid
monomers are most commonly seen in siderophores,16 but are not limited to them.17 However, our understanding of the code-conferring residues of A
domains for aryl acids is less profound. In addition, the engineering
of an A domain for aryl acids is rare.11 Recently, we discovered a novel NRPS-like protein, which consists
of an A domain, an acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain and a reducing
(R) domain, from Aspergillus terreus.18 It is involved in a polyketide biosynthesis
pathway and can convert 5-MOA, produced by a dedicated nonreducing
polyketide synthase, to 2,4-dihydroxy-5,6-dimethyl benzaldehyde (Figure 1). Compared with their bacterial counterparts, the
code-conferring residues of fungal NRPS A domains for aryl acids are
less thoroughly studied. Moreover, 5-MOA is a novel substrate for
any known A domain and cannot be predicted by current bioinformatics
tools.18 Therefore, the determination and
characterization of the specificity-conferring code of ATEG_03630
is necessary for further genome mining of related biosynthetic pathways.
In addition, it would lay the ground for substrate specificity engineering
of fungal A domains.

Traditionally, A domain characterization
and engineering relies
on two methods: (1) ATP-pyrophosphate (ATP-PPi) exchange assays using
purified A domain proteins19 and (2) genetic
modification of A domains followed by characterization of the final
NRP products.10 However, the former method
characterizes only the first half-reaction catalyzed by an A domain
(i.e., the acyl-adenylate formation reaction), but not the second
half-reaction (i.e., the thioesterification reaction involving an
ACP domain). Therefore, an apparent active substrate in this assay
may form only an acyl adenylate intermediate that cannot be transferred
to the ACP domain for subsequent reactions.11 The second method is more comprehensive and usually leads to novel
modified natural products.10,12 However, because of
the complex substrate compatibility issue of multiple rounds of condensation
in an NRPS assembly line, this method has met with limited success.
Here, we consider the NRPS-like protein as a better model system for
A domain engineering. Compared with multimodule NRPSs, it is a much
smaller protein (∼120 kDa), which is more convenient for genetic
manipulation, heterologous expression, and protein purification. In
addition, an aldehyde instead of an acyl adenylate is the final product,
which can circumvent the above-mentioned inherent disadvantage of
ATP-PPi exchange assays.

reduction of 5-MOA.

In the present study,
20 different substituted aryl acids were
used to investigate the substrate specificity of the NRPS-like protein
ATEG_03630. Combined with multiple sequence alignment, the specificity-conferring
code for the novel substrate 5-MOA is established. Through protein
engineering, the substrate specificity of the A domain is significantly
altered toward our target substrate, anthranillic acid. Finally, as
proof of concept, a one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis of aldoxime from
in-situ-generated aldehyde catalyzed by the NRPS-like protein is demonstrated
(Scheme 1).

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of the Substrate Specificity of ATEG_03630
To the best of
our knowledge, no previously discovered aryl acid
substrates of A domains contain a methyl substituent, which makes
the A domain of ATEG_03630 a unique opportunity to study the effect
of the methylation pattern on substrate specificity of an A domain.
We determined the specific activity of ATEG_03630 toward 5-MOA, 3-MOA,
orsellinic acid, and 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. As shown in Table 1, when the 5-methyl group was removed, the specific
activity decreased by ∼4.5-fold. It is likely that the 5-methyl
group provides substrate selectivity via hydrophobic interactions
with the A domain. However, methyl substituents at the 3- or 6-positions
have no effect on the specific activity.

Hydroxyl substituents
of aryl acids are known to be crucial for substrate specificity because
of their ability to form hydrogen bonds with critical residues of
the A domains.20 Interestingly, 2-hydroxyl
and 4-hydroxyl groups are not equally important for the substrate
recognition of ATEG_03630. When the 2-hydroxyl moiety was removed,
the specific activity toward 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was actually slightly
increased compared with that of 2,4-dihyxroxy benzoic acid; however,
the activity of ATEG_03630 dropped by 143-fold when salicylic acid
was used as a substrate. These results suggest that the 4-hydroxyl
group provides critical substrate recognition, likely via hydrogen-bonding,
and the 2-hydroxyl group has no interaction with the A domain. The
cocrystal structure of DhbE and its substrate 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic
acid (DHB) reveals that hydroxyl groups of DHB are hydrogen-bonded
to S240Oγ (3′-OH) and N235Nδ2 (bivalent hydrogen
bonds to 2′- and 3′-OH).20 Multiple sequence alignment (Table 2, Figure
S1 and Table S2) indicates that G263 and V267 of ATEG_03630 occupied
the same positions as N235 and S240 of DhbE, respectively. Therefore,
the lack of appropriate hydrogen-bonding partners on the side chains
of G263 and V267 is consistent with the conclusion that the 2-hydroxyl
group has no effect on substrate recognition. To determine whether
the 4-hydroxyl group acts as a hydrogen-bond donor or acceptor, we
used 4-methoxybenzoic acid as a substrate. Approximately 11-fold decrease
in specific activity was observed, which indicates that a hydrogen-bond
donor is likely required at the 4-position. This is further supported
by the fact that 4-amino-2-chlorobenzoic acid can be converted to
an aldehyde with only 4-fold decrease in specific activity compared
with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.

of the engineered ATEG_03630 mutants (specificity is defined as the
ratio of the specific activity of 5-MOA versus that of anthranilic

Substituted aryl aldehydes are
important fine chemicals for large-scale
industrial applications. For example, vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde),
the main component of vanilla flavor,21 is the global leader in aroma compounds. The search for an alternative
route to chemically synthesize vanillin via bioconversion22,23 or de novo biosynthesis24 is inspired
by significant financial incentives.25,26 De novo biosynthesis
of vanillin is of particular interest because the starting material
can be either glucose or even cellulosic biomass. It has been shown
that primary metabolites can be diverted from the shikimic acid pathway
toward vanillin biosynthesis.24 A critical
step in the de novo pathway is to convert vanillic acid to vanillin
by an aromatic carboxylic acid reductase (ACAR).27,28 So far, ACAR from Nocardia sp. is
the only viable protein.24,29 In addition, because
of the promiscuity of ACAR, isovanillin is suspected to be an undesired
byproduct from the engineered pathway.29 Because of the structural similarity between vanillic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid, we set out to investigate whether vanillic acid is a substrate
for ATEG_03630. As a result, vanillic acid and its precursor, protocatechuic
acid, can be efficiently converted to aldehyde products (Table 1). Moreover, there is a ∼8-fold difference
in specific activity between vanillic acid and isovanillic acid. Therefore,
ATEG_03630 may be a suitable or even superior alternative to ACAR
in vanillin de novo biosynthesis.

Engineering the Substrate
Specificity of ATEG_03630 toward Anthranilate
Anthranilate,
a primary metabolite in tryptophan biosynthesis,
is a very rare monomer in bacterial NRPs or polyketides.30,31 However, it is quite common in fungal secondary metabolites, including
asperlicin32 and acetylaszonalenin.33 Its planar 1,3-substituted carboxy and amino
group are critical for the formation of the benzodiazepinone and the
quinazolinone core structures. The anthranilate activating A domain
and its specificity-conferring code have been proposed.34 Our study indicates that anthranilate is a very
poor substrate for ATEG_03630 (Table 1) with
666-fold lower activity compared with the native substrate. It would
be intriguing to see whether the substrate specificity of ATEG_03630
can be enhanced for anthranilate. The substrate specificity of DhbE,
a stand-alone A domain from the siderophore bacillibactin biosynthesis
pathway, has been engineered from 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid toward
anthranilate with a 206-fold specificity switch.11 It was achieved via 10 rounds of directed evolution based
on the binding affinity of the A domain with a surrogate intermediate
(acyl-adenosine monosulfate). Although directed evolution is a powerful
high-throughput protein engineering method, the same drawback can
be observed as that of ATP–PPi exchange assays because only
the adenylation half-reaction is used in such engineering strategy.
As a result, a universal His to Trp mutation in all isolated positive
clones had to be mutated back to His to restore their ability to catalyze
the second half thioesterification reaction. On the contrary, ATEG_03630
produces aldehydes as final products. Therefore, our engineered results
would reflect both the adenylation and the thioesterification half
reactions of the A domain.

Because ATEG_03630 is a newly discovered
protein with novel substrate specificity,18 we first performed multiple sequence alignment of ATEG_03630 with
known anthranilate activating A domains as well as other A domains
with similar substrate specificity. The 10-residue specificity-conferring
codes are summarized in Table 2 and Supporting Information Table S2. Both 5-MOA and
anthranilate activating A domains are highly conserved at positions
235 and 301 (positions are numbered according to GrsA-PheA). In addition,
both classes of A domains contain variable hydrophobic residues at
positions 239, 299, and 331. However, at position 236, the 5-MOA-activating
A domains have exclusively a bulky aromatic amino acid phenylalanine,
and the anthranilate activating A domains have a highly variable hydrophobic
residue. At positions 278 and 322, the exclusively conserved tyrosine
and histidine may provide critical interactions with the native substrate
5-MOA. Proline is highly enriched at position 330 compared with glycine
in the anthranilate activating A domains. Finally, it is very interesting
that the 5-MOA activating A domains have either serine or threonine,
whereas all other A domains (including bacterial or fungal origin)
have a conserved lysine at position 517.

On the basis of our
bioinformatics analysis, we first decided to
generate mutants F294A, T307I, H358A, P366G, and S540K (mutants are
numbered according to ATEG_03630). Each purified protein was tested
against both 5-MOA and anthranilate to determine its specific activity.
First, mutant P366G showed no detectable activity toward 5-MOA or
anthranilate. In addition, the protein yield of P366G was relatively
low compared with that of other mutants. Therefore, it is likely that
mutating proline to glycine may destabilize the protein and render
it inactive. Surprisingly, mutating T307 to isoleucine increased its
activity toward the native substrate 5-MOA by ∼1.5-fold (Figure 2A), which indicates that T307 may not be involved
in any direct interactions with 5-MOA. However, the specific activity
of T307I toward anthranilate was also improved 7.8-fold, which resulted
in a moderate 5.2-fold improvement in specificity (Figure 2B). Therefore, T307I may increase the catalytic
activity of ATEG_03630 toward all substrates. Mutant F264A has a quite
moderate effect on specific activity. The combination of a 3.3-fold
decrease in specific activity to 5-MOA with an only 1.4-fold increase
in specific activity to anthranilate gave a moderate 4.5-fold improvement
in specificity. The most significant specificity improvement came
from mutant H358A. Its specific activity with 5-MOA was decreased
by 2.4-fold, and its activity to anthranilate was improved by 10.9-fold.
Therefore, its specificity was increased by 26-fold. In all previously
reported A domains, lysine is absolutely conserved at position 517.
The crystal structures of PheA and DhbE revealed that lysine 517 provided
key interactions with the carboxylate groups of the amino acid/aryl
acid substrates as well as the adenosine moiety.20,35 Surprisingly, when we mutated the distinct S540, which occupies
position 517, to lysine, only a very moderate activity decrease for
both 5-MOA and anthranilate was observed.

To shed some light
on the significance of the conserved S540 in
the 5-MOA activating A domains compared with the exclusive lysine
in the other A domains, we attempted to build a homology model of
the A domain of ATEG_03630. Because the crystal structure of aryl
acid activating A domain from fungi is not available, a homology model
was created using DhbE (PDB ID: 1MDB) as the template.20 We chose DhbE as the template because it can activate an
aryl acid instead of an amino acid. DhbE and the A domain of ATEG_03630
share only 22.3% sequence identity. However, a BLAST search indicated
that they have better sequence homology (27% identity/36% positive)
in the region from S220 to L367 (residue number according to ATEG_03630).
Notably, this region contains the first nine code-conferring residues.
Only the position 517 is not included. This suggests that the majority
of their substrate-binding pockets may be similar to each other. Superposition
of DhbE with the A domain of ATEG_03630 suggested that their overall
structures are similar (Supporting Information Figure S3). After superposition, the ligand DHB adenylate from the
DhbE crystal structure became out of position and clashed with the
homology model. Therefore, we modified the ligand to 5-MOA adenylate,
followed by energy minimization to investigate the potential interactions
between the structural model and the 5-MOA adenylate intermediate.

Interestingly, albeit the relative low quality of the model due
to the low sequence homology, some of the predicted protein–ligand
interactions are consistent with our in vitro characterization (Figure 3). For example, we concluded that the 4-hydroxyl
group of 5-MOA is critical for substrate recognition and the 2-hydroxyl
group does not contribute to substrate specificity. It is consistent
with the homology modeling results, which only predicted a strong
hydrogen-bonding between the 4-hydroxyl group and the backbone carbonyl
group of A268; no protein–ligand interaction was predicted
for the 2-hydroxyl group. F264A was predicted to have hydrophobic
interaction with the 6-methyl group of the 5-MOA moiety, which may
explain the moderate substrate specificity change of the mutant F264A;
however, the homology model predicted that the backbone carbonyl group
of H358 only had strong hydrogen-bonding with the adenylate moiety,
which cannot explain the dramatic specificity switch of the mutant
H358A. It is likely the low sequence homology rendered the homology
model inaccurate. Finally, the model suggested that, without the extended
side chain like in lysine, S540 is not involved in any interaction
with the ligand. Therefore, the significance of the conserved S540
in the 5-MOA-activating A domains need to be further investigated.
For instance, the cocrystal structure of ATEG_03630 with 5-MOA may
provide a clearer picture.

of the A domain of ATEG_03630. Predicted hydrogen bonds are shown
in green solid lines with proton–oxygen distance (Å).
Predicted hydrophobic interactions are shown in dashed lines.

Because three single mutants,
F264A, T307I, and H358A, have some
effects on substrate specificity, we set out to construct the double
mutant T307I/H358A and the triple mutant F264A/T307I/H358A to determine
whether there is a synergistic effect. Intriguingly, the double and
triple mutants have significant synergistic effects on decreasing
their activities toward the native substrate 5-MOA. Their specific
activities to 5-MOA dropped by 8.5-fold and 45.9-fold, respectively.
Unfortunately, double mutant T307I/H358A also decreased its activity
with anthranilate by 2.2-fold compared with the best parent H358A.
In addition, the specific activity of triple mutant F264A/T307I/H358A
with anthranilate returned almost to the wild-type enzyme level. Although
the double and triple mutants were not as efficient as H358A, they
achieved highest specificity switch by 42- and 47-fold, respectively.

Previously, all A domain engineering studies were performed with
bacterial A domains.9−14 In addition, most studies relied on the ATP-PPi exchange assay for
substrate specificity characterization or as a screening assay for
the directed evolution strategy.13 However,
in this study, we used a novel fungal NRPS-like protein as a template
for A domain engineering. Its relatively small size renders it more
accessible for manipulation compared with multidomain NRPS megaenzymes.
More importantly, unlike the ATP-PPi exchange assay, we rely on the
detection of aldehyde products to quantify engineering results, which
represents both the adenylation and thioesterification reactions.
In addition, aldehydes are highly active compounds for various chemical
reactions that have been developed as screening assays for directed
evolution.36,37 Therefore, we consider NRPS-like
proteins such as ATEG_03630 as a better model system for A domain
engineering.

One-Pot Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Aldoxime
In addition
to being fine chemicals themselves, substituted aryl aldehydes are
also important intermediates for organic synthesis and industrial
applications.38−40 For instance, aldoximes synthesized from aryl aldehydes
have various applications in analytical chemistry, industry, and medicine.34,41 They can serve as versatile precursors for the synthesis of amides,42 nitrile oxides,43 and amines.44 Nonetheless, because of
the low stability of aldehydes, it is difficult to prepare aldehydes
in high yields.45 Therefore, one-pot synthesis
of aldoximes from in situ enzymatically generated aldehydes has numerous
advantages.46 It is more efficient because
aldehyde isolations are not necessary. It is also more environmentally
friendly because the reactions are performed in mild buffer systems
without heavy metals.

As proof of concept, we selected 4-hydroxybenzoic
acid as the substrate for the one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis of
4-hydroxybenzaldoxime. Initial test indicated that the enzymatic reduction
of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde is much faster than
the subsequent chemical conversion to 4-hydroxybenzaldoxime. Therefore,
we optimized two parameters, including the hydroxylamine concentration
and the reaction time, to strike a balance between yield and productivity.
As shown in Table 3, when 1.5 equiv of hydroxylamine
was used, the yield of 4-hydroxybenzaldoxime reached 94.4% in 24 h.
However, when 10 equiv of hydroxylamine was used, a yield of as high
as 91.6% was obtained within 8 h. It is interesting that 10 mM hydroxylamine
seems to have no detrimental effect on ATEG_03630-catalyzed enzymatic
reduction, but it was reported that hydroxylamine can be toxic to
enzymatic reactions.46,47

Conclusion
We
characterized the substrate specificity of WT ATEG_03630 protein
and concluded that the hydrogen bond donor at the 4-position is crucial
for substrate recognition. In addition, we demonstrated that it could
be a superior candidate for de novo biosynthesis of vanillin. We have
shown that the substrate specificity of ATEG_03630 can be engineered
toward our target substrate anthranilate via bioinformatics analysis
and mutagenesis. As a result, mutant H358A increased its activity
toward anthranilate by 10.9-fold, which led to a 26-fold improvement
in specificity. NRPS-like proteins are much smaller than multidomain
NRPSs, but they still represent the thioesterification half-reaction,
which is otherwise missed from the stand-alone A domains. Therefore,
the NRPS-like protein may serve as a better model system for A domain
engineering. Finally, we demonstrated the one-pot chemoenzymatic synthesis
of 4-hydroxybenzaldoxime from 4-hydroxybenzoic acid with high yield.
Combined with the above-mentioned amenability to substrate specificity
engineering, the NRPS-like protein could serve as a promising biocatalyst
for in situ aldehyde generation for multistep one-pot synthesis.

Experimental
Procedures
Materials and Reagents
All chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Failsafe 2× PreMix buffer
G was purchased from Epicentre Biotechnologies (Madison, WI). Synthetic
complete drop-out medium lacking uracil (SC-Ura) from MP Biomedicals
(Solon, OH) was used to select Saccharomyces cerevisiae transformants containing the assembled plasmids. S. cerevisiae strain BJ5464-NpgA (MATα
ura3-52 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1 pep4::HIS3 prb1 Δ1.6R
can1 GAL) was used as the host for DNA assembly and protein
overexpression.

Plasmid Construction
Cloning of
ATEG_03630 is described
previously.18 Mutants were constructed
by the same method using primers listed in Supporting
Information Table S1.

Protein Expression and Purification from S. cerevisiae
Each expression vector was
transformed to S. cerevisiae strain
BJ5464-NpgA using the lithium
acetate/single stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol (PEG) method.48 Transformants were grown in 20 mL of SC-Ura
dropout media for 2 days and inoculated to 1 L of YPAD medium. Cells
were grown at 30 °C and 250 rpm for 72 h. The cells were harvested
by centrifugation (4000g, 15 min, 4 °C), resuspended
in 30 mL lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0,
0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole), and lysed by sonication on ice. His-tagged
proteins were purified by using Ni-NTA agarose (QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA) following the supplied protocols. The cleared cell lysate following
sonication and centrifugation was directly applied onto a column that
was packed with Ni-NTA agarose. After washing with washing buffer
containing 20 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted with the elution
buffer containing 250 mM imidazole. Purified proteins were concentrated
and buffer-exchanged into a storage buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl,
100 mM NaCl, pH = 7.9) containing 10% glycerol. The concentrated enzyme
solutions were aliquoted and flash-frozen. Protein concentrations
were determined with the Bradford assay (BioRad) using BSA as a standard.

In Vitro Characterization of ATEG_03630 and Its Mutants
For in vitro enzymatic assays, the final concentrations of enzymes
were 1 μM, 1 mM various aryl acid substrates, with cofactor
concentrations of 2 mM NADPH, 10 mM ATP and 10 mM MgCl2. The assays were carried out in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH
8.5). The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature.

A typical volume of the reaction is 200 μL. Twenty microliters
of reaction mixture was taken out at various time points and quenched
with HCl. Each reaction mixture was used for HPLC–ESI-MS analysis.
HPLC–ESI-MS was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC/MSD
XCT plus ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) with
a reversed-phase Kinetex C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). General
HPLC parameters were as follows: solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water;
solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile; gradient, 0% B to 100%
B in 25 min, maintain at 100% B for 10 min, return and maintain at
0% B for 7 min; flow rate 0.3 mL/min; detection by UV spectroscopy
at 330 nm. The amounts of aldehyde products were quantified by area
integration of the UV peak at 330 nm. A standard curve was generated
using pure aldehyde standards with the same HPLC conditions. The HPLC
parameters for detecting 2-amino benzaldehyde were as follows: solvent
A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile;
gradient, 0% B to 100% B in 60 min, maintain at 100% B for 10 min,
return and maintain at 0% B for 7 min; flow rate 0.3 mL/min.

Homology
Modeling
The cocrystal structure of DhbE with
DHB adenylate (PDB ID: 1MDB)20 was used as the template
for homology modeling. The homology model of the A domain of ATEG_03630
was constructed using the modeling program Molecular Operating Environment
(Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). The homology
model was superimposed with the cocrystal structure of DhbE and DHB
adenylate. The ligand DHB adenylate was then modified to 5-MOA adenylate.
After removing the crystal structure of DhbE, an energy minimization
of the model and the ligand was performed before the ligand–protein
interactions were investigated.

One-Pot Chemoenzymatic
Synthesis of Aldoxime
For each
in vitro reaction, the final concentrations of enzymes were 1 μM
and 1 mM 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, with cofactor concentrations as 2
mM NADPH, 10 mM ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, 1.5 mM or 10 mM NH2OH. The assays were carried out in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 8.5). The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature.

A typical volume of the reaction is 200 μL. The reaction
mixture was quenched with MeOH. Each reaction mixture was used for
HPLC–ESI-MS analysis. The HPLC parameters for detecting aldoxime
were as follows: solvent A, 0.1% formic acid in water; solvent B,
0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile; gradient, 0% B to 30% B in 25 min,
increase and maintain at 100% B for 10 min, return and maintain at
0% B for 7 min; flow rate 0.3 mL/min; detection by UV spectroscopy
at 300 nm. The amount of aldoxime was quantified by area integration
of the UV peak at 300 nm. A standard curve was generated using pure
4-hydroxybenzaldoxime standards with the same HPLC condition. See
the Supporting Information for the preparation
of 4-hydroxybenzaldoxime standards.
