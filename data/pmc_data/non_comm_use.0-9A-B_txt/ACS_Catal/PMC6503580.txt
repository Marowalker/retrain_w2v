Artificial
metalloenzymes combine a synthetic metallocofactor with
a protein scaffold and can catalyze abiotic reactions in vivo. Herein, we report on our efforts to valorize human carbonic anhydrase
II as a scaffold for whole-cell transfer hydrogenation. Two platforms
were tested: periplasmic compartmentalization and surface display
in Escherichia coli. A chemical optimization of an
IrCp* cofactor was performed. This led to 90 turnovers in the cell,
affording a 69-fold increase in periplasmic product formation over
the previously reported, sulfonamide-bearing IrCp* cofactor. These
findings highlight the versatility of carbonic anhydrase as a promising
scaffold for whole-cell catalysis with artificial metalloenzymes.

Artificial
metalloenzymes (ArMs)
result from anchoring a synthetic metallocofactor within a protein
scaffold, thereby combining attractive features of enzymatic and transition
metal catalysis.1 Enzymes are known for
high reaction rates, turnover numbers, and selectivity,2,3 whereas synthetic transition metal catalysts offer a broad range
of reactivities, some of which have no equivalent in nature.4 Merging both features promises new catalytic,
diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches and opportunities for biotechnology,
synthetic biology, and medicine.1,5A variety of ArM-catalyzed
transformations have been reported, mostly relying on purified protein
samples.1,5−9 With the long-term goal of complementing natural enzymes with ArMs
in a cellular environment, we have selected E. coli’s periplasm10,11 and its outer-membrane12,13 to compartmentalize these hybrid catalysts to minimize inhibition
of the cofactor by glutathione.7 In this
context, two β-barrel host proteins have been reported: nitrobindin12 and streptavidin.10,11,13,14 Both compartmentalization
strategies offer advantages and limitations. On the one hand, a higher
amount of host protein can be accumulated in the periplasm. On the
other hand, the access of the cofactor and its substrate to the periplasm
is hampered by the outer-membrane’s permeability.15 Herein, we report on the following: (i) the
use of wild-type human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII)16−19 for the assembly of an ArM in
a cellular environment, (ii) the chemical optimization of the sulfonamide-bearing
IrCp* cofactor for transfer hydrogenation, and (iii) comparison of
the artificial transfer hydrogenase (THase) performance for both compartmentalization
strategies (i.e., CAIIperiplasm and CAIIsurface display).

Mammalian cell-surface variants of CA are well-established
markers
for various tumor types including the following: gliomas/ependymomas,
mesotheliomas, papillary/follicular carcinomas and carcinomas of the
bladder, uterine cervix, kidneys, lungs, neck, breast, brain etc.20−23 Several sulfonamide-based anticancer drugs24−26 are used to
inhibit CA by binding to the zinc in the active site, thus halting
the carbon dioxide to bicarbonate interconversion. With medical applications
in mind,27 we hypothesized it may be possible
to rely on wild-type CA to target cells overexpressing this protein
to accumulate a sulfonamide-bearing metal cofactor, which displays
a bioorthogonal reactivity toward a caged drug. This strategy would
allow this prodrug to be site-specifically uncaged in the immediate
proximity of the cells overexpressing CA. In the past, genetic optimization
strategies have been amply applied to improve the catalytic performance
of ArMs.1 For medical applications, however,
one is limited to the protein that is overexpressed on the target
cells, thus restricting the optimization of the ArM to chemical strategies
(i.e., variation of the spacer–cofactor moiety). The performance
of the ArM was evaluated in the presence of wild-type CAII both in E. coli’s periplasm and displayed on its outer membrane
(CAIIperiplasm and CAIIsurface display,
respectively).

For the periplasmic compartmentalization, CAII
was N-terminally
fused to the signal peptide of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA)
to ensure its secretion to the periplasm of E. coli (Figure 1a).11,28 For the surface display, CAII was anchored in the outer membrane
by fusing it to a truncated E. coli lipoprotein Lpp
(residues 1–9), followed by the first five β-sheets of
OmpA (residues 46–159, Figure 1b).13,29 To probe the localization and
functionality of CAII, the fluorescent probe 4 consisting
of a carboxyfluorescein linked to an arylsulfonamide (Figure 1c) was synthesized (see Supporting Information). Probe 4 and a primary anti-CAII antibody in combination with a fluorescent
secondary antibody were used to stain E. coli cells
containing (i) an empty vector (negative control 1) or plasmids targeting
CAII to (ii) the cytoplasm (CAIIcytoplasm, negative control
2), (iii) the periplasm (CAIIperiplasm), or (iv) the cell
surface (CAIIsurface display). The samples were analyzed
by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (Figure 2). Cells containing the empty vector or CAIIcytoplasm could not be stained with probe 4 or
with the anti-CAII antibody (Figure 2). In contrast, cells containing CAIIperiplasm or CAIIsurface display were stained with probe 4 (Figure 2a, c). The flow cytometry analysis (Figure 2c, d) corroborated the observations of the
fluorescence microscopy. Nearly the same fluorescence increase was
observed for both the compartmentalization in the periplasm and on
the cell surface when using probe 4. Nonetheless, conclusions
about the amount of bound-fluorescent probe 4 are difficult
to draw since the probe 4 may behave different in the
periplasm and on the surface (Figure 2c). Staining with probe 4 confirms that
induction of CAIIperiplasm and CAIIsurface display lead to the expression of functional CAII. The anti-CAII antibody
is not able to enter the periplasm of E. coli cells13 and, thus, only labels cells expressing CAIIsurface display (Figure 2b, d). The immunostaining, validated with the probe-labeling
experiments, suggests that CAII is correctly localized and functional.
Furthermore, the labeling with probe 4 suggests that
neutral and hydrophobic probes and metallocofactors around 700 Da
can passively diffuse into the periplasm. For streptavidin-based ArMs,
we had speculated that biotin present on the cofactor may favor the
accumulation of biotinylated cofactors in the E. coli periplasm11 by hijacking an active, energy-dependent,
and carrier-mediated biotin uptake.30−32

compartmentalization systems.

After establishing the compartmentalization of
CAII in the periplasm
and on the surface of E. coli cells, we tested the
use of these systems for the assembly of THases. The activity of these
two systems was evaluated by using a self-immolative fluorogenic substrate,
which facilitates high-throughput screening. Upon N=C reduction
of the quinolinium substrate 1, the fluorescent umbelliferone 2 and a iminoquinonemethide 3 (Figure 1) are produced.10 The highly electrophilic intermediate 3 spontaneously reacts with nucleophiles present in solution
(either water or nucleophilic amino acids).33 To determine the catalytic activity of these systems, we adapted
the assay conditions developed for a streptavidin-based THase.10 In short, CAII was expressed at 30 °C for
4 h, cells of an OD600 = 3 were harvested, and the pellet
was washed with 0.8 mM [Cu(gly)2] and resuspended in the
cofactor buffer (2 μM cofactor, 100 mM MOPS, pH 7, 154 mM NaCl).
After incubation with the cofactor 5–10 for 1 h, the cells were pelleted and washed twice to remove unbound
cofactor. The cell pellet was resuspended in the reaction buffer (1
M formate, 500 μM substrate 1, 0.4 M MOPS, pH 7)
and was incubated for 16 h at 30 °C shaking at 280 rpm (see Supporting Information). The uncaging of umbelliferone 2, resulting from the reduction of quinolinium 1, was monitored by fluorescence (323 nm excitation, 451 nm emission).
To exclude the possibility that natural E. coli enzymes
uncage substrate 1, E. coli cells were
treated as described above, except that the cofactors were omitted.
Without cofactor incubation, product 2 formation was
not observed, independent of the expression system (i.e., CAIIcytoplasm, CAIIperiplasm, CAIIsurface display, Figure 3b). Next,
we tested the previously reported piano-stool cofactor 5.17,18 Using either the periplasm- or the surface-displayed
THase, conversions, albeit limited, were 5- and 9-fold higher than
the conversion observed for cofactor 5 unspecifically
bound to cells expressing CAIIcytoplasm (Figure 3b). Next, we chemically optimized
the THase activity by varying the first coordination sphere around
the IrCp* moiety. Building on the picolinamide-based ligands reported
by Do,34−36 Himeda,37 and Duhme-Klair,38 we anchored an arylsulfonamide moiety via a
spacer on 2-picolinamide (Figure 3a; see Supporting Methods in the Supporting Information for the cofactor synthesis).

degrees of unspecific activity; see Figure S5. Data displayed are the means ± standard deviation of experiments
performed in triplicate; the individual data and additional controls
are depicted in Figure S5.

Gratifyingly, the THase activity
for the optimized cofactors 6–10 were
markedly superior to those observed
with cofactor 5 either in vitro (Figure S3) or for whole-cell catalysis (Figure 3b, Table 1). The background for the negative
controls, cells containing CAIIcytoplasm or an empty vector,
remains low (Figure 3b and Figure S5a). These results suggest
that the introduced 4-hydroxypicolinamide moiety has a beneficial
effect on THase activity. Removal of the electron-donating hydroxy-group
(compare cofactors 7 and 8) had a deleterious
effect on the THase activity for whole-cell catalysis: cofactor 7 is nearly 3-fold more active than cofactor 8 for CAIIsurface display.

a For comparison,
the product formation
monitored by fluorescence was normalized and cofactor 5·CAIIperiplasm was set to 100. Data displayed are
the means ± standard deviation of experiments performed in triplicate.

Next, we investigated
the effect of the spacer on the THase activity
and the corresponding dissociation constant Kd with purified CAII (Figure 3a and Table 1). For cofactors consisting of the same first coordination
sphere (i.e., 4-hydroxy-2-picolinamide) and arylsulfonamide anchor,
the nature and the length of the spacer has a pronounced effect on
the dissociation constant. Cofactor 6, bearing the shortest
spacer, displayed the highest dissociation constant (Kd > 1000 nM), suggesting it probably dissociates during
the washing step. Accordingly, the whole-cell activity is very low.
Whereas the Kd for the cofactors bearing
two (i.e., cofactors 7 and 8) and three
atom spacers (i.e., cofactors 9 and 10)
are roughly comparable, thus ensuring quantitative binding to CAII
under catalytic conditions, the THase activity significantly differs,
emphasizing the critical influence of the second coordination sphere
on catalytic performance (Figure 3b and Table 1).

To highlight the subtle differences in the second
coordination
sphere resulting from the different spacers, we determined the cofactor’s
localization within CAII by X-ray crystallography. High-resolution
X-ray data for cofactor 7–10·CAII
were obtained (Table S6 and Figure 4). Residual electron density
in the Fo – Fc and the anomalous difference density map were observed, highlighting
the presence of cofactors 7–10 in
the funnel-shaped vestibule of CAII. Modeling of cofactor 7–10 into the electron density projected the iridium
in the position of the anomalous density peak (Figure S7). As observed for cofactor 5,17 the Ir-atom is not fully occupied. It was modeled
in the (S)-configuration with an occupancy of 60%
for cofactor 7, 9, and 10 and
90% for cofactor 8 (Table S6).

Figure 4 Structural characterization of IrCp* piano-stool cofactors bound
to CAII. (a) Overlay of the Ir-position from cofactor 5 (gray, PDB: 3ZP9), cofactor 7 (cyan, PDB: 6QFU), cofactor 8 (lilac, PDB: 6QFV), cofactor 9 (dark green, PDB: 6QFW) and cofactor 10 (pink, PDB: 6QFX bound to wild-type
CAII). The Ir-atoms are depicted as spheres in the color of the corresponding
protein backbone and the ligand surrounding the metal was omitted
for clarity. (b) Cofactor 7, (c) cofactor 8, (d) cofactor 9, (e) cofactor 10, bound
to wild-type CAII. The protein is depicted as a transparent surface
and an orange cartoon representation. Amino acids in the proximity
of the cofactor are highlighted as sticks and labeled. The cofactors
are represented as sticks, and the Ir and Zn ions, as orange and light-yellow
spheres, respectively, and surrounded by the corresponding anomalous
electron density (red mesh at 5 σ). The distance from the amide
oxygen of the cofactors to the N of Q92 is highlighted in yellow dashes
and labeled; chloride, green; nitrogen, blue; oxygen, red; sulfur,
yellow.

Comparing the localization
of the different cofactors reveals that the Ir-atoms of cofactor 7 and 8 are located deepest inside the hydrophobic
funnel of CAII (Figure 4a). The firm positioning of cofactor 7 and 8 within CAII is secured by a hydrogen bond between the oxygen of
the cofactors’ amide group and the nitrogen of the side chain
of glutamine 92 (Q92, O···N distance 2.8 and 2.9 Å
for cofactor 7 and 8, respectively). For
cofactors 9 and 10, the O···N
distance is 4.3 and 4.5 Å, respectively. The localization of
cofactor 10 is most diffuse, as reflected by the smear
of the anomalous electron density (Figure 4e).

To determine the uptake of cofactor 7, the iridium
concentration for the empty vector, CAIIcytoplasm, CAIIperiplasm, and CAIIsurface display was determined
by ICP-MS (Figure 3c and Figure S5b). These data allow determination
of the turnover number (TON) per iridium for the whole-cell THase.
The ICP-MS sample preparation was identical to that implemented for
whole-cell catalysis (see Supporting Information). The following results were obtained: cofactor 7·CAIIperiplasm 348 ± 43 nM Ir thus amounting to 93 ± 11
turnovers (TON); cofactor 7·CAIIsurface display 315 ± 8 nM Ir thus corresponding to 85 ± 3 TON (Figure 3c). These data suggest
that similar amounts of THases are compartmentalized on the cell surface
and in the periplasm as observed in the flow cytometry analysis with
probe 4 (Figure 2c). Although periplasmic-expression levels typically exceed
surface-displayed expression levels,39 the
Ir concentration and corresponding TONs suggest that the outer membrane
limits the access of the cofactor and the substrate to the compartmentalized
CAII. Accordingly, the surface-display strategy seems most suitable
to develop ArMs for synthetic biology and therapeutic purposes.

With the long-term goal of exploiting overexpressed CA on cancer
cells to concentrate organometallic cofactors and to uncage drugs,
this study has revealed the following features: (i) picoline-amide
containing cofactors lead to significantly higher whole-cell THase
activity compared to the previously reported picoline-sulfonamide
containing cofactor 5;17 (ii)
chemical optimization is a powerful means to improve catalytic performance
of a THase using wild-type CAII; (iii) CAII is a promising monomeric
globular scaffold for in vivo catalysis, leading
to ≥90 TONs; (iv) CAIIperiplasm and CAIIsurface display are excellent platforms for ArM-based whole-cell catalysis.
These results confirm that CA is a propitious scaffold for the accumulation
of ArMs on the surface of tumor cells.40 Tumor-localized ArMs may be valorized for the development of innovative
cancer therapies, including targeted-drug delivery. Current efforts
are aimed at adapting this protocol to cancer cell models overexpressing
CA on their surface and using NADH as a hydrogen source instead of
formate.41
