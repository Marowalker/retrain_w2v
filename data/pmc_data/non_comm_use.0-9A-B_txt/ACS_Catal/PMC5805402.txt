The
one-pot Diels–Alder cycloaddition (DAC)/dehydration
(D) tandem reaction between 2,5-dimethylfuran and ethylene is a potent
pathway toward biomass-derived p-xylene. In this
work, we present a cheap and active low-silica potassium-exchanged
faujasite (KY, Si/Al = 2.6) catalyst. Catalyst optimization was guided
by a computational study of the DAC/D reaction mechanism over different
alkali-exchanged faujasites using periodic density functional theory
calculations complemented by microkinetic modeling. Two types of faujasite
models were compared, i.e., a high-silica alkali-exchanged faujasite
model representing isolated active cation sites and a low-silica alkali-exchanged
faujasite in which the reaction involves several cations in the proximity.
The mechanistic study points to a significant synergetic cooperative
effect of the ensemble of cations in the faujasite supercage on the
DAC/D reaction. Alignment of the reactants by their interactions with
the cationic sites and stabilization of reaction intermediates contribute
to the high catalytic performance. Experiments confirmed the prediction
that KY is the most active catalyst among low-silica alkali-exchanged
faujasites. This work is an example of how the catalytic reactivity
of zeolites depends on multiple interactions between the zeolite and
reagents.

1 Introduction
Zeolites make up an important
class of inorganic materials with
major applications in heterogeneous catalysis. They are crystalline
microporous aluminosilicates. The molecule-sized micropores are arranged
in different manners, giving rise to >200 different pore topologies.
During zeolite catalysis, reactivity is controlled by the intrinsic
properties of the active sites, either protons or Lewis acid sites,
and the shape selectivity induced by the confined space around the
active sites.1−3

Zeolites are traditionally used in refinery
processes. More recently,
the use of zeolites in the context of valorization of biomass into
chemicals and fuels has also been explored.4−6 Lewis acid zeolite
catalysts can play an important part in upgrading renewable lignocellulosic
biomass feedstock toward highly valuable aromatic products, which
are currently produced solely from fossil hydrocarbon resources.7,8 Most desired aromatics are toluene and xylenes. Among the different
xylene isomers, the market demand for p-xylene is
the highest.9

The primary constituents
of biomass are cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin.10 Of the former two, cellulose
is a crystalline linear polysaccharide built from glucose, and hemicellulose
is an amorphous polysaccharide whose major constituent is xylose.
Lignin, on the other hand, is a large polyaromatic polymer. Both the
polysaccharide- and polyaromatic-based compounds require significant
upgrades before aromatic compounds are obtained. One of the possible
pathways for obtaining aromatic compounds from (hemi)cellulose starts
with hydrolysis followed by isomerization and stepwise hydrogenation
of the released monosaccharides (i.e., glucose in the case of cellulose),
yielding various furanic compounds like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and
2,5-dimethylfuran (Figure 1a).11−13 These furanic compounds are considered biomass platform
molecules, and their conversion to industrially important intermediates
is a challenging task. One approach to obtaining aromatics from furanics
is the sequential Diels–Alder cycloaddition (DAC) and dehydration
(D) with alkenes (DAC/D reaction).14−16 After the DAC reaction,
the 7-oxanorbornene cycloadduct is dehydrated to obtain the final
aromatic product.17,18 Lewis acid (LA) zeolites are
potential catalysts for such reactions, as (i) the DAC reaction is
a textbook example of an organic reaction greatly benefiting from
LA catalysis and (ii) catalyst separation from the product stream
is far easier with heterogeneous catalysts than with homogeneous catalysts.16,19 Moreover, Lewis acids catalyze fewer undesirable side reactions
in biomass upgrading than Brønsted acid (BA) zeolites do.20

study highlighted with the green background. (b) Periodic high-silica
faujasite model used in this work. (c) Periodic low-silica faujasite

A range of catalysts have been
investigated to enhance the DAC/D
reaction of DMF with ethylene,21−28 as part of a wider search for DAC/D-based production pathways toward
aromatic compounds with different furanic or alkene reactants.29−34 Examples of heterogeneous catalysts for p-xylene
from furanics include HY,21−24 HBEA,25 MBEA (M = Sn,
Ti, or Zr),26,27 and silica–alumina aerogels.28 Among these studies, Vlachos and co-workers
compared the one-pot DAC/D reaction of DMF with ethylene over HY and
alkali-exchanged faujasites.21,22 In their work, the
mechanistic picture was derived from models such as an isolated cation22 or a larger ONIOM cluster model.21 The reaction energetics of Brønsted and
Lewis acid sites in zeolites were compared. A conclusion of this work
was that the NaY-catalyzed reaction is limited by the dehydration
of the bicyclic intermediate.21

With
respect to these important initial studies, we can ask whether
a single-cation model of the active sites in alkali-exchanged faujasite
can capture all the relevant features. This is related to the nature
of the active site, e.g., the local active site topology, the density
of the active site, and the active site chemical composition. Often,
catalysts are studied via a reductionist approach in which the chemical
complexity of the catalytic system is simplified. It is becoming clearer
that such a reductionist approach alone is not sufficient to understand
the activity of catalysts whose reactivity depends on their complex
chemical composition.35 For instance, heterogeneous
surface reactions are often profoundly affected by nearby active sites
and adsorbates occupying these sites.36−38 During homogeneous catalysis,
the participation of the solvent has been shown to play an important
role in influencing the reaction energetics and reaction pathway.39,40 In enzymatic41,42 and zeolite43,44 catalysis, it is becoming increasingly evident that the surrounding
matrix and the nearby active groups or sites within the catalytic
pocket or zeolite pore play an immense role in the reaction energetics.
Taking these aspects into account is important if one aims to predict
catalytic performance.

In this work, we employ periodic density
functional theory (DFT)
calculations and microkinetic modeling to reveal the role of reactant
confinement on the DAC/D reaction of DMF with ethylene to p-xylene as a model reaction. The key focus is on establishing
the key parameters that control the reactivity of Lewis acid zeolite
catalysts in the DAC/D reactions beyond the isolated site model. To
this end, we used periodic high- and low-silica alkali-exchanged faujasite
zeolite models. This allowed us to study the reactivity for the conventional
isolated site model (high-silica zeolite) as well as low-silica models
capturing the higher complexity of the actual catalyst systems containing
multiple accessible sites. The computational results indicate that
a high density of accessible sites near the reactants and reaction
intermediates in the zeolite micropore are important factors that
determine the catalytic performance. Our results show that reaction
barriers are significantly lowered. Moreover, we find that the reactivity
trend among the low-silica alkali-exchanged faujasites is different
from the one derived for their high-silica counterparts. On the basis
of these results, we predict that potassium should be the most suitable
alkali cation for modifying low-silica faujasite to achieve good performance
in the DAC/D reaction of DMF with C2H4 to obtain p-xylene. Alkali-exchanged faujasite catalysts with a chemical
composition similar to that of the modeled low-silica faujasites were
synthesized and subjected to kinetic tests to experimentally determine
the activity trend. The experimental results confirm the theoretical
predictions.

2 Computational and Experimental
Details
Models and Methods
The models were based on the rhombohedral
unit cell of faujasite containing 48 T sites and 96 oxygen atoms.
The high-silica model (Si/Al = 47; Si47Al1O96M1) contained one isolated site per rhombohedral
unit cell (Figure 1b). The low-silica model (Si/Al = 2.4; Si34Al14O96M14) had a high active site density (Figure 1c). M+ was either Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+. More information about the cation placement
and lattice relaxations can be found in the Supporting Information. In the following, we will use MFAU to refer to
the faujasite model with a Si/Al ratio of 47 and MY to refer to the
model with a Si/Al ratio of 2.4. The starting geometries were selected
on the basis of geometric considerations combined with a preliminary
computational screening of a range of alternative adsorption modes.
The computed adsorption energies for the different optimized adsorption
complexes are summarized in Tables S1 and S2.

All periodic DFT calculations were performed with the gradient-corrected
PBE exchange-correlation functionals implemented in the Vienna Ab-Initio
Simulation Package (VASP).45−49 The projected-augmented-wave scheme (PAW) was used to describe the
electron–ion interactions. Long-range dispersive interactions
were accounted for by using the DFT-D3 method with Becke–Johnson
damping.50,51 The k-point mesh was reduced to the Γ
point. The cutoff energy for the plane-wave basis set was 500 eV,
and a root-mean-square (RMS) force convergence criterion of 0.015
eV/Å was employed. Occasionally, some models did not fully reach
this strict RMS force criterion, and the convergence criterion was
relaxed to 0.035 eV/ Å. This was caused by strong forces on cations
confined within the double six rings distant from the active site.
The relaxed convergence criteria were deemed acceptable because the
current zeolite models feature extremely shallow potential energy
surfaces. Structural optimization below 0.05 eV/Å usually led
to energy changes of <5 kJ/mol.

To identify the transition
state, a two-step approach was adopted.
First, a Climbing-Nudged-Elastic Band (CNEB) calculation52,53 was performed to estimate the minimum energy pathway (MEP) (spring
constant of 5 eV/Å2, maximum length hypervector between
images of 0.5 Å). The accepted RMS force of the converged CNEB
was ≤0.14 eV/Å. Next, the geometry of the identified transition
state was further optimized using the quasi-newton procedure (maximum
RMS of <0.015 eV/Å). Vibrational frequencies were then calculated
with the finite displacement method (0.0015 Å) to confirm the
nature of the stationary point.

Microkinetic Modeling
The reaction energy diagrams
derived from the DFT calculations were used to compute rate constants
for a microkinetic model of the DAC/D reaction. The set of reaction
equations used in the MKM modeling efforts is shown in Table S3. The calculations were performed with
a C++ program written in house.54,55

For N elementary reactions, we can define 2N elementary
reaction steps, i.e., both forward and backward: 1  where ci is the concentration of reactant i in elementary
reaction step n. In the rate equation, νi is the stoichiometric coefficient of species i in reaction n. The time-dependent concentration
of component i is 2  

Furthermore, we considered competitive adsorption of the reactants,
followed by surface reactions toward the products that then desorb
again. Re-adsorption of the products was not taken into account; i.e.,
the simulation was performed in the low-conversion limit. This yields
for adsorption 3  where R is the concentration
of either DMF or C2H4 and θ the fraction
of available free sites. Desorption is described as 4  where CP* is that for either of the two reactants
(DMF and C2H4) or the two products (p-xylene and
H2O).

The rate constants of the individual elementary
reaction steps
are determined using the Eyring equation:56 5  with 6  where for elementary reaction step n the DFT-computed activation energy is denoted as E⧧ and Q⧧ and QIS are the partition functions
of the corresponding initial and transition state, respectively. The
ratio of the partition functions defines the activation entropy, as 7  

We
then assumed all elementary reactions to take place with both
equal probability and no significant entropy change (mainly vibrational
in the adsorbed state). Therefore, the exponential prefactor is Areact. = [(kbT)/h] ≈ 1013. Because
most of the entropy losses are encountered during the adsorption step,
the value of 1013 is a reasonable approximation of the
pre-exponential factors for the reactions occurring over active surface
sites within the harmonic limit.57 Additionally,
we assumed mobile transition states for product desorption, so that Ades. = 1015. Furthermore, we varied
the adsorption prefactors of the reactants (ADMF and AC2H4), reflecting differences in pressure. Note that the molecular adsorption
rate constant for reactant i can be described as 8  where Pi is the partial pressure (pascals)
of the reactant in the gas
phase, O the surface area of the adsorption site
(square meters), Mw,i the reactant mass (kilograms), and Si the dimensionless sticking number. Let us consider
DMF adsorption, for instance, at 105 Pa of DMF and 503
K with an O of 1 × 10–20 m2 and Si set to
1. The resulting kads is 1.4 × 107 s–1.

Next, the degree of rate control
(DRC) for every elementary step
was determined.58 Briefly, the DRC for
elementary reaction n is defined as the relative
change in the overall rate as a function of the changing reaction
constant (kn) while the
equilibrium constant remains fixed. This resembles changing the stability
of the transition state (TSn) corresponding
to elementary reaction n. 9  where χpx,n is the DRC parameter for elementary reaction n for
the product p-xylene (px), rpx is the overall reaction rate, and kn and Kn are the forward rate and equilibrium constants for reaction n, respectively. The value for χpx,n can either be positive or negative, indicating that a step
is rate-controlling (increase in rate with a decrease in ETSn) or rate-inhibiting (decrease
in rate with a decrease in ETSn), respectively. The total sum of all DRCs is always
unity.

Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
The parent
material NaY (Si/Al = 2.5) was obtained from Akzo Nobel. Aqueous MNO3 solutions (M = Li, K, Rb, or Cs) were used for ion exchange
to obtain the Li, K, Rb, or Cs form of the Y zeolite, respectively.
Ion exchange was repeated five times at 343 K for 2 h with 0.5 M MNO3 solutions using a solution to zeolite ratio of 20 mL/g. After
being washed and dried overnight at 383 K, zeolites were calcined
at 723 K for 3 h in air. Relevant characterization data of the zeolites
are provided in the Supporting Information. The results indicate a high level of cation exchange while crystallinity
and porosity are retained.

Reaction Rates
Activity tests were
performed in a 100
mL TOP Industrie autoclave equipped with a mechanical stirrer and
a pressure control system. In a typical experiment, catalysts were
dried under vacuum at 473 K for 3 h prior to the reaction inside the
reactor. The system was heated to the reaction temperature (503 K),
and then a 0.5 M solution of DMF in n-heptane was
added. When the desired temperature was reached, the reactor was pressurized
with 6 × 106 Pa of ethylene. Sampling of the liquid
phase was performed every 5–10 min after the start of the reaction.
Identification and quantitative analysis of the reaction products
were performed using GC-MS and GC-FID systems (Shimadzu GC-MS GC-17A-QP-5050,
Stabilwax; Shimadzu GC GC-17A, Rxi-5 ms). To obtain the reaction orders,
the reaction rates were measured by varying the initial DMF concentration
from 0.3 to 1.5 M.

3 Results and Discussion
DFT Calculations
Reaction
Mechanism
The DFT-computed reaction energy
diagrams for the DAC/D reaction of DMF with ethylene to p-xylene over different alkali-exchanged faujasites are shown in panels
a and b of Figure 2. The one-pot DAC/D reaction starts with the adsorption of the reactants
in the supercage (DMF + C2H4 + Z → 1/Z, where Z refers to MFAU or MY). Adsorption is followed
by the DAC reaction (1 → 2), yielding
a bicyclic intermediate (2, 1,4-dimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene).
Next, migration of the furanic oxygen (Of) to a position
bridging the C1/C2 pair isomerizes 2 into epoxide 3 (3,6-dimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]hept-2-ene
intermediate). This species isomerizes (3 → 4) into an alcohol 4 (1,4-dimethylcyclohexa-2,4-dien-1-ol)
via an intramolecular proton transfer from the C5-methylene
group to Of. The driving force for this reaction is the
formation of the conjugated diene and the release of the strain within
the epoxide ring. Finally, alcohol 4 is dehydrated (4 → 5) via a proton transfer from the
C6-methylene group to OfH, producing adsorbed p-xylene and water (5 + H2O). Desorption
of these products completes the catalytic cycle.

energy diagrams for DAC/D conversion of DMF
and ethylene over alkali-exchanged (a) single-site FAU (Si/Al = 47)
and (b) realistic Y zeolite (Si/Al = 2.4) models.

For the all-silica FAU and MFAU models, independent of M,
the adsorption
of DMF is almost 2 times stronger than that of ethylene. Adsorption
in the former model arises from solely dispersive interactions (Table S1). The adsorption complexes are of the
η5-coordination type between the π-system of
DMF and the exchangeable alkali cation. The co-adsorbed state, in
which such a coordinated DMF complex shares the confined space of
the faujasite supercage with physisorbed ethylene, is the starting
point of the catalytic process (1/FAU). The individual
DMF adsorption and co-adsorption energies (Figure 2a, 1) for different MFAU models
correlate well with the Lewis acidity of the exchangeable cations:
the interaction energy decreases with an increase in ionic radius
from Li+ to Cs+. The co-adsorbed reactants undergo
a DAC reaction (1 → 2) during which
two new bonds are formed synchronously between the C1–C6 and C4–C5 pairs. The overall
reaction enthalpy for the 1 → 2 reaction
varies from −20 kJ/mol for CsFAU to −89 kJ/mol for LiFAU.
The highest reaction barrier is found for CsFAU (94 kJ/mol) and the
lowest for LiFAU (64 kJ/mol).

The isomerization step of 2 → 3 is promoted by the interaction between
the migrating Of and the extraframework cation. Despite
this stabilizing interaction,
this step is much more difficult than the preceding DAC reaction.
The calculated barriers for this step range from 140 kJ/mol for LiFAU
to 182 kJ/mol for RbFAU. The next, slightly exothermic, isomerization
step (3 → 4) to form alcohol 4 proceeds with barriers of 108, 108, 140, 136, and 132 kJ/mol
for LiFAU, NaFAU, KFAU, RbFAU, and CsFAU, respectively.

The
final dehydration step (4 → 5) is
strongly exothermic by 104–135 kJ/mol depending on the
cation. The reaction is facilitated by the electrostatic stabilization
of OfH by the cation and weak H-bonding interactions with
the siliceous framework. Consequently, the activation barrier for
the dehydration step (4 → 5 + H2O) is rather high. The largest barriers of 188 and 181 kJ/mol
are computed for NaFAU and RbFAU, respectively, while the lowest barrier
of only 112 kJ/mol is predicted for LiFAU.

The reaction energies
and the barriers of the isolated site models
(Figure 2a) indicate
that the DAC reaction is not the rate-limiting step in the overall
reaction sequence. The computed barriers for the isomerization and
dehydration steps are much higher than those for the DAC step. These
computational results suggest that the catalytic process cannot be
achieved under practical conditions. This is in line with the mechanistic
proposals put forward by Vlachos and co-workers, who concluded that
Brønsted acid catalysis is preferred over Lewis acid catalysis
for the dehydration reaction.22

This
mechanistic picture derived for the MFAU models is very different
for the low-silica faujasite model. Figure 2b summarizes the computed reaction energies
for the DAC/D reaction of DMF and ethylene over MY models with a Si/Al
ratio of 2.4. The supercages of the low-silica faujasite models feature
a reactive ensemble consisting of three exchangeable cations in the
proximity of each other, namely, two SII sites and one SIII site.
Adsorption of DMF on the SII site is preferred over adsorption on
the SIII site because of the enhanced electrostatic stabilization
[e.g., ΔΔEadsNaY = −24 kJ/mol (Table S2)]. The starting configuration in 1/MY
involves η5 coordination of DMF on the SII site and
ethylene adsorbed on the opposite SII site (1/MY). The
adsorption energy for co-adsorption of both reactants in 1/MY follows the Lewis acidity of the cations; it increases with an
increase in Lewis acidity. CsY is an exception from the trend because
of the large size of the Cs+ ion. The possibility of forming
more intermolecular contacts with the larger cations in spite of their
individual low Lewis acidity leads to an overall stronger adsorption
in CsY than in RbY. The DMF···C2H4 intermolecular distances gradually decrease with the increasing
size of the exchangeable cation (Figure 3a,b). This trend is again broken in the CsY
model. Ethylene is displaced because of the large size of the Cs+ ions (Figure 3c). There is not enough space to accommodate both DMF and C2H4 between two opposite SII sites, in contrast to all
other 1/MY adsorption geometries.

Figure 3 CDMF–Cethylene distances for (a) LiY
and (b) RbY. The crowded interior of Cs-exchanged Y is shown in panel
c. Color scheme: Si, yellow; Al, blue; O, red; C, dark gray; H, light
gray; Cs, light gray; Li, purple; Rb, brown. Optimized distances are
given in Ångströms.

The 1/MY co-adsorption complex represents the
starting
configuration for the DAC reaction. This reaction is most exothermic
for RbY (−65 kJ/mol) and least for CsY (−20 kJ/mol).
In contrast to the single-site FAU models, the reactivity trend is
inverted. For instance, the activation barriers for LiY and NaY are
105 and 107 kJ/mol, respectively, while it is only 62 kJ/mol for RbY.
We hypothesize that there can be two explanations for this observation,
not necessarily mutually exclusive. The first attributes the trend
inversion to electronic structure effects, e.g., sharing of electron
density between the two reactants such that an activated complex in 1/RbY exists. The second is related to the adsorption energy
of the individual compounds onto their respective adsorption sites,
leading to a higher Eact for stronger
adsorption. Further detailed electronic structure analysis is required
to shed light on the fundamental origin of this phenomenon.

Next, the isomerization steps transform bicyclic intermediate 2 into epoxide 3 and alcohol 4.
The 2 → 3 step is slightly endothermic
(16–34 kJ/mol), and the corresponding activation barrier is
lowest for LiY and NaY (both 114 kJ/mol), intermediate for KY (143
kJ/mol), and highest for RbY and CsY (158 and 160 kJ/mol, respectively).
The second isomerization step, 3 → 4, is most exothermic for NaY (−59 kJ/mol) and least for CsY
(−23 kJ/mol). The lowest barriers of 71 and 67 kJ/mol are computed
for LiY and NaY, respectively. KY and RbY promote this step with intermediate
barriers of 95 and 86 kJ/mol, respectively, and the highest barrier
of 113 kJ/mol is predicted for CsY.

The final product (5 + H2O) is obtained
in a very exothermic dehydration step. The computed energy changes
for this step range from −89 kJ/mol for LiY to −179
kJ/mol for KY. The lowest activation barriers are found for LiY and
KY (98 and 80 kJ/mol, respectively) and intermediate barriers for
NaY and CsY (117 and 111 kJ/mol, respectively). The highest activation
barrier for the dehydration step is found for RbY (167 kJ/mol).

In summary, the presence of multiple accessible active sites in
the low-silica model allows for their cooperative action toward confined
intermediates and transition states in the catalytic cycle. As a result,
the overall computed reaction energetics are altered significantly.
The catalyst reactivity trend is changed as compared to those derived
from the single-site models; e.g., the DAC reactivity trend is completely
inverted. Moreover, the stability of the reaction intermediates increases
along the reaction coordinate, leading to lower activation barriers
for the isomerization and dehydration barriers.

Isomerization
and Dehydration Steps
The results from
theoretical studies using the (embedded) cluster approach21,22 and the current data obtained with periodic DFT calculations on
single-site alkali-exchanged MFAU zeolites point to the dehydration
step (4 → 5) being the rate-limiting
step in the DAC/D process. However, in the low-silica MY models, the
dehydration barrier is significantly lower. This step is therefore
not necessarily rate-limiting in low-silica alkali-exchanged zeolites
anymore.

In an attempt to explain the variations in the intrinsic
barrier of the dehydration (4 → 5) step, we analyzed representative structures of the dehydration
transition states: TS4/KFAU and TS4/KY (Figure 4). We focused on the K-exchanged models, because the largest
relative decrease in the dehydration activation barrier is observed
for KY and because TS4/KY is more stable than
anticipated on the basis of the preceding reaction steps for the MY
catalysts (Figure 2b). Two main factors are considered when analyzing the transition
states formed in the different models. The first is the increased
framework basicity caused by the higher aluminum content of the low-silica
MY models.59 The second is the effect of the exchangeable cations because
weaker Lewis acids enhance the basicity of the framework.60

in the
text and respective optimized transition state structures in KFAU
(b) and KY (c) models. Selected interatomic distances are given in
Ångströms.

The dehydration reaction involves the migration of a C5-bound proton (HC5) to a C4-bound OH
moiety
of confined alcohol intermediate 4. In KY, the OH group
is in a bridging position between two K+ ions [r(HO···K) = 2.57 and 2.74 Å], while
it coordinates to a single K+ ion in KFAU [r(HO···K) = 2.52 Å]. These interatomic distances
are all within or near the estimated HO···K distance
in bulk KOH [r(HO···K)bulk = 2.73 Å].61 The transition states
in KFAU and KY show very similar intermolecular r(HO···HC5) and r(HO···C4) distances for the activated bonds
of the alcohol intermediate (1.93 and 1.88 Å, respectively).
The r(OHδ−···C4) distances for KFAU and KY are practically the same, i.e.,
2.37 and 2.39 Å, respectively. In addition, we expect one significant
hydrogen bonding interaction of OHδ− with
the framework in KFAU (2.67 Å), whereas we expect two H-bonds
in KY (3.54 and 3.16 Å). Coordination of TS4 to SII is also achieved through asymmetric K+–π(C=C) interactions, where SII is located closer to one
carbon atom than to the other. The shortest K+–CC=C distance is 3.54 Å in KFAU and 3.38 Å
in KY.

Microkinetic Modeling
Microkinetic
modeling was employed
to determine the overall reaction rates and compare the performance
of the different MY catalysts on the basis of the reaction energy
diagrams in Figure 2. The DFT-computed barriers were used to calculate rate constants
for the elementary steps in the mechanism. The reaction temperature
in the simulations was set to 503 K, and we varied the partial pressures
of the reactants. These simulations predict turnover frequencies [TOFs
(Figure 5)], reaction
orders of DMF and ethylene (Figures S1 and S2, respectively), and active site coverages by reaction intermediates
(Figures S3–S5) as a function of
the DMF and C2H4 adsorption prefactors (ADMF and AC2H4, respectively). A DRC analysis is used to identify
the most significant rate-controlling and rate-inhibiting elementary
reaction steps (Figures S6 and S7).

Figure 5 Contour plots
of MKM-predicted TOFs as a function of different
values of ADMF and AC2H4 assuming a 1:1 ratio of reactants.
The diagonal, solid lines indicate the approximated operating regime
of each MY catalyst. The dashed lines indicate the boundaries between
the different regimes labeled with Roman numerals. The 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4, and 4 → 5 reactions are termed I–IV, respectively. Note that
we do not account for gradients in this representation. The prime
following the Roman numeral IV indicates that adsorption and desorption
of reactants or products are rate-controlling.

On the basis of the DRC values, we distinguish four different
regimes
in which the 1 → 2, 2 → 3, 3 → 4,
and 4 → 5 reactions are rate-controlling
(regimes I–IV, respectively). A fifth regime is also defined
in which the 4 → 5 reaction is rate-controlling
while adsorption and desorption of reactants or products are rate-inhibiting
(regime IV′). The regimes are indicated in the TOF plot given
in Figure 5 in which
the rate is given as a function of the adsorption prefactor. The ranges
represent variations in the prefactors, which mainly depend on the
partial pressure (pi)
and molecular weight (Mw,i). The region between the solid lines in Figure 5 demarcates the expected experimental regime.

Overall inspection of Figure 5 shows that only three of four potential elementary
reaction steps control the rate. These are regimes I, II, and IV in
which the 1 → 2 (the DAC reaction), 2 → 3 (the first isomerization), and 3 → 4 (the final dehydration reaction)
reactions are rate-controlling. The highest TOFs are found in regime
II for KY, RbY, and CsY. Clearly, the highest activity occurs when
the first isomerization step controls the overall rate. Regime II
does not occur for LiY and NaY under the explored set of conditions.

Consistent with Sabatier’s principle, the transition between
the regimes is characterized by changes in the reaction orders and
the active site coverages. For instance, when going from regime I
to IV, the ethylene reaction order changes from +1 to −1, while
the DMF reaction order is nearly unaffected. This is in keeping with
an increased rate of the DAC reaction with an increased ethylene prefactor,
ultimately resulting in a high coverage of the alcohol that needs
to be dehydrated in the final step. For large DMF prefactors, we find
that both the DAC reaction and the dehydration reaction are significant
rate-controlling steps. Of these two elementary reaction steps, the
latter controls the rate the most. Furthermore, we note that for large ADMF values and medium to low AC2H4 values, the adsorption/desorption
processes are rate-inhibiting steps. From this analysis, we conclude
that the dehydration reaction cannot keep up with either the DAC reaction
or DMF adsorption.

Another example consistent with Sabatier’s
principle is
the high TOF observed in regime II for KY, RbY, and CsY. In this regime,
approximately half of the available active sites are either vacant
or occupied by the DAC reaction product (2). Site occupation
by 2 is typically found for low values of ADMF. The remaining half of regime II matches with DMF
as the most abundant adsorbed species. In addition, the DMF and ethylene
reaction orders in regime II both range from zero to approximately
+1. At the point of maximum TOF, 2 is the most abundant
and DMF and ethylene reaction orders are positive and close to zero
(only for RbY are vacant active sites most abundant at the point of
the highest TOF).

From the analysis presented above combined
with the TOF contour
plots in Figure 5,
we conclude that KY, RbY, and CsY are the candidate optimum catalysts.
KY is predicted to be the most active one.

Experimental Verification
To verify whether our MKM-based
predictions are correct, we synthesized low-silica alkali-exchanged
faujasites. They were subjected to kinetic experiments in a batch
reactor to determine the initial rates and DMF reaction orders. The
measured initial rates and DMF reaction orders are shown in panels
a and b of Figure 6, respectively. Figure S8 shows the fit
resulting in Figure 6a. Small-scale blank activity tests (5 mL, batch) showed no conversion
of DMF with 20 bar of ethylene in n-hexane at 250
°C, indicating the crucial role of the catalyst in the coupling
reaction.

Figure 6 (a) Initial reaction rates of the various alkali-exchanged zeolites
tested at 503 K, 60 bar of C2H4, and 0.5 M DMF
in n-heptane. (b) The DMF reaction order is obtained
under similar conditions, but with varying DMF concentrations.

The highest initial rate was found
for KY (21 mmol L–1 h–1). The
lowest initial rate was found for LiY
(3.5 mmol L–1 h–1). DMF reaction
orders were also determined for KY and LiY. KY has a positive DMF
reaction order of 0.59 ± 0.04, while that for LiY is close to
zero (0.11 ± 0.13).

Previous studies report typical reaction
rates for the HY catalyst
to be in the range of 2–11 mmol L–1 h–1.23 Our data show that
the KY catalyst provides an appreciably higher rate of 21 mmol L–1 h–1 under milder conditions with
only 0.5 M DMF and 230 °C instead of 1.5 M DMF and 250 °C,
which were used with the HY catalyst by Vlachos and co-workers.23 The superior performance of KY is further evidenced
by the results of small-scale batch activity tests (see Figure S9). For the alkali-exchanged Y zeolites,
the yields of the p-xylene product after reaction
for 15 h at 250 °C follow the activity trend established by the
kinetic experiments (Figure 6). The Brønsted acidic HY catalyst provided a p-xylene yield (8%) >2-fold lower than that of KY (21%).
In the presence of HY, the 2,5-hexanedione byproduct was formed in
an almost equimolar amount (7%), whereas for KY, p-xylene was the only identified reaction product.

The exclusive
formation of p-xylene for the reaction
with KY is attributed to the inhibition of the ring-open hydrolysis
side reactions due to (i) the use of the nonpolar solvent and (ii)
the low Brønsted acidity of the alkali-exchanged zeolite catalysts.
Indeed, aliphatic solvents have been shown to enhance p-xylene production by reducing the hydrolysis paths to 2,5-hexanedione.24,62 However, such a promoting solvent effect should be similar for both
HY and KY. On the other hand, the ring-opening hydrolysis of DMF is
typically catalyzed by strong Brønsted acid sites.63,64 Such reactions are unlikely to be promoted by the hard extraframework
Lewis acid sites or the adjacent basic sites on the lattice in the
alkali-exchanged faujasites.

Our results demonstrate that, in
contrast to earlier reports,21 alkali-exchanged
faujasites are highly active
and selective alternatives to the established HY catalysts for the
DAC/D reaction of DMF with ethylene to p-xylene.
The experiments support the conclusion drawn on the basis of the MKM
modeling about the superior activity of KY catalyst, with RbY and
CsY being the other two top-performing catalysts. The positive DMF
reaction order observed in the experiment is also in agreement with
the MKM prediction.

4 Conclusions
We present
a cheap and easy-to-synthesize K-exchanged faujasite
zeolite (KY; Si/Al = 2.6) catalyst showing a high activity for the
production of p-xylene via the one-pot DAC/D reaction
of DMF with ethylene. These results allow us to revise earlier conclusions
concerning the activity of alkali-exchanged faujasites for this reaction
and therefore expand the scope of perspective catalysts well beyond
the commonly considered Brønsted acidic systems.

A multiscale
computational approach combining periodic DFT calculations
with MKM modeling was employed to study the mechanism of the one-pot
DAC/D reaction by faujasite-type zeolites. The results of the DFT
calculations were directly employed for the construction of a microkinetic
model that yielded a catalytic activity trend qualitatively reproduced
by our experiments.

The unexpected catalytic performance of
the alkali-exchanged faujasites
stems from the cooperative nonlinear effects manifested by the complex
reactive ensembles involving multiple reactive sites confined within
the zeolite microspores. The comparison of the results obtained with
the conventional single-site MFAU models with those for the more chemically
complex low-silica MY faujasite models points to the importance of
the chemically relevant modeling for our mechanistic understanding
of these systems. Importantly, the increased chemical complexity of
the MY models gave rise to reactivity trends, which could not be predicted
from either classical organic chemistry concepts or the computational
results obtained with the reductionist single-site models.
