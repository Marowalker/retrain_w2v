A major challenge in enzymology is
the need to correlate the dynamic
properties of enzymes with, and understand the impact on, their catalytic
cycles. This is especially the case with large, multicenter enzymes
such as the nitric oxide synthases (NOSs), where the importance of
dynamics has been inferred from a variety of structural, single-molecule,
and ensemble spectroscopic approaches but where motions have not been
correlated experimentally with mechanistic steps in the reaction cycle.
Here we take such an approach. Using time-resolved spectroscopy employing
absorbance and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and
exploiting the properties of a flavin analogue (5-deazaflavin mononucleotide
(5-dFMN)) and isotopically labeled nicotinamide coenzymes, we correlate
the timing of CaM structural changes when bound to neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (nNOS) with the nNOS catalytic cycle. We show that
remodeling of CaM occurs early in the electron transfer sequence (FAD
reduction), not at later points in the reaction cycle (e.g., FMN reduction).
Conformational changes are tightly correlated with FAD reduction kinetics
and reflect a transient “opening” and then “closure”
of the bound CaM molecule. We infer that displacement of the C-terminal
tail on binding NADPH and subsequent FAD reduction are the likely
triggers of conformational change. By combining the use of cofactor/coenzyme
analogues and time-resolved FRET/absorbance spectrophotometry, we
show how the reaction cycles of complex enzymes can be simplified,
enabling a detailed study of the relationship between protein dynamics
and reaction cycle chemistry—an approach that can also be used
with other complex multicenter enzymes.

Introduction
Underpinning the function
of all enzymes is the concept of protein
conformational landscapes, knowledge of which is essential also in
the rational design of synthetic proteins1,2 and
in the drug discovery process.3,4 Many structure determination
techniques (e.g., X-ray crystallography) have produced “frozen”
snapshots of proteins that provide mechanistic insights into function.
The drawback is that these snapshots typically represent only the
lowest energy state of the many substates found within the conformational
landscape of a dynamic protein. It is widely perceived that the interchange
between individual conformers contributes, in part, toward the ability
of an enzyme to enhance the rate of catalysis5−9 and gate chemical steps,10−12 as well as
impart specificity for substrates.4,13,14 The interchange between different conformations occurs
over several angstroms, on time scales that span picoseconds to seconds.
Many biophysical techniques can be used to probe the modulation of
energy landscapes: for example, following the binding of ligands/inhibitors/partner
proteins,14−18 or changes in temperature, ionic strength, and pressure.12,19−21 However, fewer studies have focused on the detection
of transient conformations that appear during enzyme catalysis. Likewise,
little information is available on the mechanistic trigger(s) for
these conformational transitions (e.g., substrate binding/product
release and/or chemical steps). Understanding the nature and impact
of short-lived high-energy conformational states on enzyme function
is currently a topic of major interest.

A protein whose dynamic
properties have been studied extensively
is calmodulin (CaM).22−29 CaM is a small, ubiquitous protein involved in the regulation of
many biological processes in eukaryotes.30 By binding Ca2+, CaM undergoes major conformational change,
shifting from a “closed” form to an extended “dumbbell”
shape by the separation of two globular and structurally related calcium-binding
domains. Once CaM adopts this “open” conformation, numerous
hydrophobic residues on its surface are exposed, increasing the affinity
of CaM for a variety of partner proteins.23 One such partner is the flavohemoprotein neuronal nitric oxide synthase
(nNOS), for which CaM binding is essential for function.31,32 nNOS is one of three tissue-specific isoforms of nitric oxide synthase
(NOS), all of which are homodimers and produce l-citrulline
and the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) from NADPH, dioxygen,
and l-arginine.31 Despite the
lack of atomic level structural data for full-length nNOS holo-enzyme,
a structural and mechanistic model (Figure 1) has emerged from a wealth of spectroscopic
data20,32−51 and determined structures of component NOS domains.52−57

Figure 1 Structural
organization and electron flow through nitric oxide
synthase (NOS). The FAD domain is shown in bright orange, the FMN
domain in light orange, the heme domain in red, and the partner protein
calmodulin (CaM) in in gray. Ligand (NADPH and CaM) binding is implicated
in shifting the conformational equilibrium of nNOS and thus regulating
electron transfer during the catalytic cycle. Dimerization of nNOS
occurs at an interface between the heme domains.

Each nNOS monomer comprises a reductase and an oxygenase
domain
separated by a CaM binding region. The reductase domain is structurally
similar to cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR)56,58 and encompasses FAD- and FMN-binding domains separated by a connecting
domain and a flexible linker. Individual nNOS monomers dimerize at
the interface of the oxygenase domains, which contain a regulatory
PDZ domain and a heme domain. The heme domains also contain tightly
bound heme and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) cofactors. On
binding to NOS, Ca2+-bound CaM undergoes a conformational
transition from an elongated “open” structure to a compact,
spherical-shaped conformation.57,59 These structural transitions
are accompanied by changes in nNOS as the protein occupies energetically
more favored conformations.41,45

Large-scale domain
motion (>10 Å) influenced by CaM binding
is believed to regulate electron transfer in NOS enzymes (Figure 1).18,20,55 Catalysis is initiated by the binding of
the reducing coenzyme NADPH to the FAD-binding domain and hydride
transfer to the N5 position of the FAD isoalloxazine ring.33 Interflavin electron transfer from the FAD cofactor
to FMN then follows.33,60 On reduction of the FMN, electrons
are transferred to the heme domain in the partner monomer of the enzyme
dimer47−49 where NO is produced. FMN to heme electron transfer
requires the presence of CaM, which is essential also for NO production.32,47,61 On the basis of spectroscopic
and structural data, shuttling of the FMN domain between the FAD and
heme domains is thought to be a feature of the natural catalytic cycle
(Figure 1).18,55

The two flavin cofactors are juxtaposed when electrons are
transferred
from the FAD to FMN domains, allowing for efficient interflavin electron
transfer in the “input” state (Figure 1).18,55,56 Given the relatively large distance between the FMN and heme cofactors
in the “input” state, electron transfer between the
reductase and oxygenase domains does not occur unless there is movement
of the FMN domain toward the oxygenase domain (the so-called “output”
state). These shifts from “input” to “output”
states are regulated by CaM binding61 and
have been studied using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including
fluorescence,44,62−64 single-molecule
fluorescence,45 electron paramagnetic resonance,20,42,43 cryo-electron microscopy,39,40,65 and temperature jump spectroscopy.35 However, to the best of our knowledge, there
are no reported studies that have directly visualized by time-resolved
spectroscopy conformational substate transitions during catalytic
turnover.

To address this limitation, we have labeled CaM with
Alexa555 and
Alexa647 fluorophores at defined locations to investigate CaM dynamics
during enzyme turnover. CaM labeling was used because the nNOS flavohemoprotein
contains 24 cysteine residues and 90 lysine residues, many of which
are solvent exposed, preventing specific labeling of NOS with external
fluorophores. Using Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET),
we have studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of CaM bound to
nNOS when nNOS is reduced with NADPH using rapid mixing stopped-flow
spectrophotometry. We demonstrate also how use of a flavin analogue
(5-deazaflavin-mononucleotide; 5-dFMN)66,67 in place of
FMN can simplify the correlation of structural transitions with NOS
reaction chemistry. Our approach is general and mutatis mutandis could
be adopted with other complex multicenter redox enzymes.

Experimental
Section
The Supporting Information contains
details of chemical suppliers and established methods for cloning,
expression, and purification of CaM, nNOS, and the C-terminal kinase
domain of FAD synthetase. Likewise, the Supporting Information documents contain methods for the enzymatic synthesis
of 5-deazaflavin mononucleotide (5-dFMN) from 5-deazariboflavin along
with conditions and instrumentation used for nNOS steady-state turnover
assays, static fluorescence, and circular dichroism measurements.

Preparation
of 5-dFMN Reconstituted NOS
The FMN cofactor
was removed from NOS using immobilized metal affinity chromatography.68 Briefly, 10 mg of purified NOS was applied to
a 5 mL Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, U.K.) equilibrated
with 40 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) and supplemented with 10% glycerol
and 150 mM NaCl at room temperature. The FMN was removed by washing
the column with 25 mL of buffer supplemented with 2 M KBr at room
temperature. Next, the column was transferred to a cold room (4 °C)
and washed with 25 mL of cold buffer before elution of the apoprotein
with buffer supplemented with 260 mM imidazole. For reconstitution
with 5-dFMN, the eluted apoprotein was added to a solution containing
∼0.5 mM 5-dFMN, 0.2 mM FAD, 0.2 mM tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), and 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) contained in 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0) buffer, supplemented with 10% glycerol and 150 mM NaCl, and
incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The reconstituted
protein was concentrated, and excess flavins and other cofactors were
removed by applying the concentrated protein solution to an Econo-Pac
DG10 column (Bio-Rad, Hempstead, U.K.) equilibrated in 40 mM HEPES
buffer (pH 7.6) and supplemented with 10% glycerol and 150 mM NaCl.
For anaerobic experiments, the final desalting step was performed
in a Belle Technology anaerobic glovebox. Protein concentrations were
determined at 444 nm in the presence of CO, using a molar extinction
coefficient of 74 mM–1 cm–1 (A444 – A500).

Conjugation of Extrinsic Fluorophores to T34C/T110C-CaM
A solid-state labeling methodology (SSL) was followed to achieve
high-efficiency labeling of T34C/T110C-CaM with Alexa555 and Alexa647
maleimide.69,70 T34C/T110C-CaM (5 μM) was
incubated initially in 40 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.1), supplemented with
5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and
10% glycerol for 2 h, at 4 °C. The protein was then recovered
from solution by ammonium sulfate precipitation and pelleted by centrifugation.
To remove traces of DTT, the T34C/T110C-CaM pellet was washed with
40 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.1) supplemented with 5 M ammonium sulfate,
1 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, and 10% glycerol and recovered
by centrifugation. The protein pellet was then resuspended in 40 mM
HEPES buffer (pH 7.6) supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2 and
400 mM NaCl containing 100 μM of the desired fluorophore(s).
Labeling reactions were incubated overnight, at 4 °C, in the
dark. Excess fluorophore was separated from conjugated T34C/T110C-CaM
by passing the sample down an Econo-Pace DG10 gel filtration column
(Bio-Rad, Hempstead, U.K.) equilibrated with the desired buffer. For
all anaerobic experiments this final step was performed in a nitrogen-purged
glovebox using oxygen-free buffer. Each fluorophore (100 μM)
was mixed with the protein to label T34C/T110C-CaM with an approximate
1:1 ratio of Alexa555 and Alexa647.

Stopped-Flow Spectrophotometry
All stopped-flow measurements
were performed using an Applied Photophysics Ltd. (Leatherhead, U.K.)
SC18MV instrument. The sample handling unit was placed inside a Belle
Technology anaerobic glovebox (<5 ppm of O2). All buffers
and solutions were degassed by bubbling with oxygen-free nitrogen
prior to entering the glovebox and left overnight to equilibrate to
ensure removal of all traces of oxygen. All stopped-flow experiments
were performed at 10 °C in 40 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.6), supplemented
with 10% glycerol and 150 mM NaCl.

For UV–vis measurements
of nNOS flavin reduction, reactions were initiated by mixing 5 μM
NOS with 100 μM NADPH (final concentrations) in the presence
or absence of CaM and 1 mM Ca2+. Under these conditions
the observed rates are independent of the coenzyme concentration.33 Multiple wavelength studies were carried out
using a photodiode array (PDA) detector (Applied Photophysics Ltd.,
Leatherhead, U.K.). In single-wavelength studies, flavin reduction
by NADPH was monitored at 485 nm, a heme isosbestic point.71−73 For kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements single-wavelength
studies of flavin reduction were performed using pro-R and pro-S NADP2H. All measurements were
repeated at least five times and are plotted as an average ±1
standard deviation.

Stopped-flow Förster resonance energy
transfer (FRET) measurements
were performed by mixing 0.25 μM nNOS/0.25 μM labeled
T34C/T110C-CaM with 100 μM NADPH or 500 μM NADP+ (final concentrations) in the presence of 0.5 mM Ca2+ and 5 μM H4B. Dual-channel fluorescence was recorded
with a 2 mm excitation path length using two photomultiplier tubes
(PMT), including a R1104 red-sensitive photomultiplier detector (Applied
Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, U.K.) to increase signal to noise
for the acceptor channel. The donor channel was fitted with a 600
± 5 nm bandwidth pass (ThorLabs, Ely, U.K.) filter, while the
changes in fluorescence emission of the acceptor were monitored using
a 650 nm cut-on filter (ThorLabs, Ely, U.K.). All measurements were
repeated at least five times and are plotted as an average ±1
standard deviation. Data were analyzed and interpreted using methods
previously described.11,12 This analysis involved subtracting
the percentage emission of the single-labeled CaM-bound fluorophore
(Donor- or Acceptor-T34C/T110C-CaM) from the percentage emission of
the corresponding fluorophore in the double-labeled CaM (DonorAcceptor-T34C/T110C-CaM)
to extract the fluorescence changes associated with FRET alone.

nNOS tryptophan emission changes upon binding NADP+ were
monitored by mixing 0.2 μM nNOS/0.2 μM CaM (final concentration)
with varying concentrations of NADP+, in the presence of
0.5 mM Ca2+. All emission changes associated with tryptophan
were recorded using a stopped-flow cell with a 2 mm excitation path
length. Tryptophan was excited at 295 nm, and emission changes were
followed using a 340 nm cutoff filter.

All kinetic traces were
fitted to standard exponential decay functions
using Origin Pro (software).

Results and Discussion
FRET Reporter
of CaM Conformation Bound to nNOS
Our
experimental model for detecting both CaM dynamics and nNOS-bound
CaM conformational change during the catalytic cycle of nNOS is shown
in Figure 2. Since
wild-type CaM has no native cysteine residues, we introduced two solvent-exposed
Cys residues (T34C/T110C-CaM) using site-directed mutagenesis, thereby
allowing the addition of fluorophores at two specific locations in
CaM. Labeling efficiency was >90%, and there was no recordable
nonspecific
fluorophore–CaM conjugation (data not shown). This double-cysteine-containing
CaM protein has been used previously to monitor CaM dynamics in a
variety of published fluorescence studies,22,64,70,74,75 and it is useful here for probing intra CaM dynamics
on binding to nNOS. This follows because (i) the position of the fluorophore
binding sites, one on each of the N- and C-terminal calcium-binding
globular domains of CaM, allows small changes in CaM conformation
to be detected, (ii) the two maleimide labeling sites are located
far away from the calcium-binding pockets on calmodulin and have little
or no reported effect on the CaM–calcium interaction, and (iii)
the effect of mutagenesis, as well as addition of the bulky fluorophore
molecule to CaM, has no noticeable effect on the known catalytic ability
of CaM to stimulate nNOS steady-state turnover (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). On the basis of
predicted fluctuations in distance between the two fluorophore labeling
sites when CaM shifts between “open” and “closed”
conformations (∼15–60 Å; Figure 2A), we selected the fluorophore pair of Alexa555
(Donor, D) and Alexa647 (Acceptor, A) with a calculated Förster
radius (R0) of 47 Å. This allows
the monitoring of subtle changes in CaM dynamics by Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET). Note, however, that not all labeled
CaM molecules will undergo FRET due to the random nature of the labeling
strategy. The selection of the fluorophore pair took into account
also the fluorescence excitation spectra of both fluorophores (λmax values of 555 and 645 nm for donor and acceptor fluorophores,
respectively), which are red-shifted from the nNOS and CaM intrinsic
fluorophores (flavins and aromatic amino acids). Thus, the analysis
of FRET data (a reporter of CaM dynamics) is not compromised by undesirable
fluorescence emission (Figure S2 in the
Supporting Information).

Figure 2 Ligand binding and the dynamic landscape of
CaM. (A) Structures
of apo (PDB_1CLL, shown on the left), Ca2+-bound (PDB_1CFC,
shown in the middle) and both Ca2+/nNOS-peptide-bound forms
of CaM (PDB_2O60, shown on the right). Divalent calcium ions are shown
as yellow spheres, and the nNOS peptide is represented as an orange
ribbon. The distances between the α-carbon atoms of the two
fluorophore labeling sites (Cys34 and Cys110; highlighted in red)
are 27, 52.4, and 12.4 Å for the apo, Ca2+-bound and
the Ca2+/nNOS-bound forms, respectively. (B) Normalized
fluorescence emission spectra showing ratiometric changes in the donor
and acceptor emission. Samples: Alexa555-Alexa647 labeled T34C/T110C-CaM
(black); T34C/T110C-CaM plus Ca2+ (red); T34C/T110C-CaM
plus Ca2+ and nNOS (blue). All data in (B) were normalized
to the emission maxima of their respective donor-only sample, and
any emission changes observed from directly exciting the acceptor
were corrected for by subtracting away from the double-labeled sample
containing the same amount of acceptor (see Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information). Conditions are described
in the Experimental Section.

Prior to conducting stopped-flow FRET studies to
monitor the dynamics
of nNOS-bound CaM, we recorded and analyzed fluorophore labeled-T34C/T110C-CaM
fluorescence emission to see if our experimental model for tracking
CaM dynamics fit to previously published ideas of how the conformational
landscape of CaM adjusts on ligand binding. Relevant CaM structures
determined by X-ray crystallography76 and
NMR spectroscopy77 are shown in Figure 2, along with the
ratiometric changes in the equimolar donor to acceptor labeled (DA)
T34C/T110C-CaM emission when CaM binds Ca2+ and nNOS (see Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information
for unprocessed data, including single fluorophore labeled D/A-T34C/T110C
emission under the same conditions, and for information on data normalization).
The altered fluorescence data indicate a change in the conformational
landscape of apo-CaM on binding Ca2+. This shift in conformation
from a “closed” to a more “open” form
is evident from the reduced FRET efficiency: an increase in donor
emission at 570 nm and a decrease in acceptor emission at 670 nm relative
to fluorophore emission in the Ca2+-free DA-T34C/T110C-CaM
when fluorophores were excited at 555 nm. When the fluorophore labeled
apo-T34C/T110C-CaM was incubated with both Ca2+ and nNOS,
an increase in the acceptor emission along with an anticorrelated
response in donor emission were observed. This recorded FRET change
is indicative of CaM forming a compact conformer with short Cys34-Cys110
distances, previously observed from published structural data of NOS57 and nNOS peptides78 bound to CaM.

Prior to performing time-resolved experiments,
we assessed the
possibility for inter-CaM FRET (FRET from CaM-CaM across the nNOS
homodimer), which in principle could affect the interpretation of
nNOS-bound intra-CaM FRET data (i.e., FRET within the individual nNOS-bound
CaM proteins). Two separate batches of T34C/T110C-CaM were labeled
with either donor or acceptor fluorophores, giving two separate and
single-labeled CaM samples (D- and A-T34C/T110C-CaM). An equimolar
mix of the D and A single-labeled T34C/T110C-CaM was added to 1 mol
equiv of nNOS, and no FRET was observed across the nNOS dimer (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). These
data are in agreement with recently published cryo-EM structures40 of native NOS proteins, which show the distances
(>90 Å) between the two nNOS-bound CaM molecules to be outside
the range for efficient energy transfer between the fluorophore pair.

Electron Transfer Kinetics in nNOS in the Presence and Absence
of CaM
We probed the kinetics of NADPH-dependent nNOS flavin
reduction by transient absorption stopped-flow spectrophotometry under
pseudo-first-order conditions (20-fold excess NADPH).33 nNOS is a complex enzyme with multiple cofactors (FAD,
FMN, and heme) that are rich in optical features spanning the UV–visible
spectrum. To study reduction of the nNOS flavins (FAD and FMN) by
stopped-flow spectrophotometry, we followed the quenching of flavin
absorbance at 485 nm, an isosbestic point for heme.71−73 Stopped-flow
traces reporting on nNOS (±CaM) flavin reduction, along with
their respective exponential fits, are presented in Figure 3. Transients were fit optimally
to five exponential terms (Figure 4B) over a time scale of 2 μs to 200 s. However,
given that the nNOS-CaM steady-state turnover values, kcat, for NO formation and NADPH consumption at 10 °C
are ∼0.1 and 0.3 s–1, respectively, we focus
here only on the first four kinetic phases, as the slow fifth phase
(with a rate constant of ∼0.01 s–1) is not
relevant to catalysis (Figure 3). Four resolvable kinetic phases have been seen previously
in studies of the isolated nNOS reductase domain,33,79 and in line with the study by Knight and co-workers,33 we observed no appreciable increase in the rate
of flavin reduction in full length nNOS in the presence of CaM in
comparison with its absence. CaM does nonetheless have an effect on
the relative amplitudes of the individual kinetic phases. These CaM-dependent
influences on the amplitudes of kinetic phases are significant in
all four phases (Figure 3 and Table 1), and
as previous studies have implied,34 it
is likely that CaM has a role in governing nNOS flavin redox potentials.
Alongside a CaM-induced structural change of nNOS that will affect
the electron transfer geometry/distance, any alteration in redox potentials
might also account for observed stimulation of electron transfer rates
from nNOS FMN to the extrinsic partner protein cytochrome c in comparison to CaM-free nNOS (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).

sequential exponential processes are shown. Measurements were performed
at least twice with different NOS preparations. Representative transients
shown are the average of six to eight individual traces.

and (C) show the time-resolved anticorrelated emission changes of
donor and acceptor fluorophore labeled T34C/T110C-CaM bound in equimolar
concentrations to nNOS and 5-dFMN nNOS, respectively, on mixing with
excess NADPH in a stopped-flow instrument. (B) and (D) show NADPH

on mixing with excess NADPH along with the ratio of donor toacceptor
fluorophores (blue) representing defined CaM “opening”
(increased Cys–Cys distances) and “closing” (decreased
Cys–Cys distances) steps during turnover. The first four rate
constants associated with nNOS flavin reduction are relevant to enzyme
turnover and have been labeled accordingly as “flavin reduction”;
the slow phase is not relevant to steady-state turnover and has been
termed the “EQ” state (see main text for a more detailed
discussion). The area between the black dotted lines in (D) (∼1–11
s) corresponds to the interflavin electron transfer step that is lost
in the 5-dFMN nNOS variant. See the Experimental
Section for details on conditions and instrumentation used.

The involvement of the four observed
kinetic phases observed in
stopped-flow studies of nNOS flavin reduction by NADPH in the enzyme
catalytic cycle was probed by kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements
using site specifically deuterated NADPH (pro-R and pro-S NADP2H). KIE values were significant for the first three phases observed
in stopped-flow studies of flavin reduction when excess pro-R (but not pro-S) NADP2H is mixed with nNOS (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The KIE values observed
for the first three kinetics phases suggest that they report on hydride
transfer from NADPH to FAD. These phases, however, do not map to discrete
mechanistic steps, as the electron transfer steps are reversible and
coupled. This accounts for the observation of primary KIEs in each
of the first three phases measured in our stopped-flow studies. Below
we demonstrate that interflavin electron transfer is predominantly
associated with the fourth kinetic phase in studies with nNOS that
contains 5-dFMN rather than the conventional FMN (vide infra).

Direct
Monitoring of CaM Dynamics during Catalytic Turnover
of nNOS
We have used FRET stopped-flow spectroscopy to detect
transient nNOS-bound CaM conformations that appear during the reaction
cycle of nNOS. Donor/acceptor fluorophore-conjugated T34C/T110C-CaM
(DA-T34C/T110C-CaM) was bound to nNOS in equimolar concentration and
rapidly mixed with NADPH. The time-resolved fluorescence emission
was followed on the same time scale as the nNOS reaction chemistry
(vide supra). nNOS-bound DA-T34C/T110C-CaM was also mixed with buffer
only in order to assess any potential photobleaching over the time
scale of the rapid mixing experiments (200 s). No changes in emission
were recorded over this time period for the acceptor fluorophore,
and very small changes (∼1%) were observed for the donor fluorescence.
Since these emission changes were minor, they were omitted from subsequent
analysis of all fluorescence emission data. FRET data representing
the single-turnover conformational changes of nNOS-bound CaM on reduction
with NADPH are shown in Figure 4A,B. Here the represented time-resolved donor and acceptor
fluorescence emission changes are a deconvolution from other contributions
to the emission response (Figure S7 in
the Supporting Information), most notably the spectral changes in
the nNOS bound chromophores (heme and flavins). We extracted the fluorescence
emission change associated with donor–acceptor fluorophore
FRET by subtracting the single-labeled (donor or acceptor) T34C/T110C-CaM
bound nNOS sample relative emission from the relative emission of
the corresponding fluorophore in the double-labeled (donor and acceptor)
T34C/T110C-CaM bound nNOS sample (for more information see refs (11 and 12)). Changes in the donor and acceptor
emission were anti-correlated, indicative of changes in FRET efficiency,
and were fit to a four-exponential decay function (Figure 4A).

FRET data, which
are presented as a ratio of donor to acceptor emission (Figure 4B), clearly exemplify an opening
of the compact CaM protein, which is bound to nNOS initially in the
oxidized form when it is rapidly mixed with NADPH. This opening is
kinetically coupled to early stages of the flavin reduction chemistry
(k1), involving the formation of a mixture
of enzyme species (i.e., predominantly a distribution of FAD hydroquinone
and oxidized FAD-NADPH charge transfer (CT) species; see ref (33) for a more detailed discussion
of the reaction mechanism). Following the formation of this predominantly
more open CaM substate, time-dependent emission changes in the donor
and acceptor fluorescence show CaM to close, revealing a more compact
conformer with shorter interfluorophore distances. This subsequent
closing of the transiently opened nNOS-bound CaM conformer occurs
in a single kinetic process with a rate constant of 15.6 s–1, which is similar to the k2 value observed
for flavin reduction (Tables 1 and 2). This predominantly closed
CaM conformer appears to be structurally similar to the form of CaM
bound to oxidized nNOS (i.e., it has the same FRET emission properties).
The third rate constant (k3) for flavin
reduction appears not to be associated with intra-CaM conformational
change on binding to nNOS (at least within the detection limits of
the instrumental setup used). The observed rate constants associated
with the fourth (k4) and fifth (k5) kinetic phases of nNOS flavin reduction correlate
closely with observed kinetic phases that report on intraCaM dynamics
(i.e., a well-defined decrease in CaM-bound fluorophore FRET efficiency
is observed).

There are no crystallographic data for full length
nNOS; thus,
the orientation that CaM adopts in the nNOS calmodulin binding site
is not known. Structures only exist for the isolated reductase component,55,56 the oxygenase domain,52−54 and the FMN domain bound to CaM.57 Consequently, how the structure of nNOS is affected
by the change in CaM structure is not known. Current models invoke
a complex landscape for the FAD, FMN, and oxygenase domains, and the
mechanism of electron transfer is thought to involve conformational
sampling of the FMN domain to facilitate electron transfer from the
FAD domain to the heme oxygenase component. CaM is implicated, albeit
in an ill-defined way, in this conformational sampling mechanism and
is known to assist electron transfer from the FMN domain to the heme
oxygenase. What we see for the first time from the current study is
that CaM itself undergoes complex structural transitions during the
catalytic cycle of nNOS, and these dynamic changes are likely central
to the conformational sampling mechanism and the coordination of electron
delivery from the FAD domain to the heme oxygenase.

Our FRET
studies suggest that changes in the CaM conformation are
coupled to early stages of flavin reduction, specifically FAD (but
not FMN) reduction. To test this idea further, we have exploited the
use of the FMN derivative 5-deazaflavin mononucleotide (5-dFMN),66,67 which cannot stabilize the flavin semiquinone species. Incorporation
of this analogue in nNOS is therefore expected to block FAD to FMN
transfer in nNOS but still enable reduction of the FAD domain by NADPH.
The availability of 5-dFMN nNOS would therefore simplify the redox
chemistry in stopped-flow studies with NADPH and enable study of conformational
change by FRET, while (importantly) retaining the overall structural
integrity of nNOS.

New Form of nNOS Containing 5-Deazaflavin-Mononucleotide
(5-dFMN)
We simplified stopped-flow analysis of electron
transfer in nNOS
by preventing electron flow to the FMN and oxygenase domains, enabling
more precise correlation of CaM conformational change with redox chemistry.
This was achieved by substituting the natural FMN cofactor with the
flavin biomimetic 5-dFMN. The affinity of the FMN cofactor for NOS
is known to be less than that of the tightly bound FAD and heme cofactors.45 The FMN cofactor was removed from nNOS using
the weak chaotropic agent potassium bromide.68 Apo-flavoproteins can generally be reconstituted with flavin derivatives
modified at the isoalloxazine moiety, since the major interactions
of the protein with the cofactor are associated with the N10 side
chain.68,80 5-dFMN is structurally similar to conventional
FMN and has been used previously as a biomimetic with other flavoproteins.80 By incubating 5-dFMN with FMN-depleted nNOS
the FMN binding site was replenished with 5-dFMN. Differences in the
spectral properties of native and 5-dFMN bound nNOS (specifically,
a decrease in absorbance at ∼450 and ∼380 nm and an
increase in absorbance at ∼400 and ∼340 nm; Figure S11 in the Supporting Information) are
entirely consistent with the known absorption properties of 5-dFMN
and FMN (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information).
Moreover, the secondary structure of 5-dFMN nNOS, determined by near-UV
circular dichroism (CD), is essentially identical with that of native
nNOS (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information).
The overall protein secondary structure is therefore retained following
replacement of FMN with 5-dFMN.

The activity of the reconstituted
5-dFMN nNOS enzyme was investigated using a variety of enzymatic steady-state
turnover assays. In addition to reduction of the heme in the oxygenase
domain, the diflavin reductase domain of nNOS is able to reduce artificial
electron acceptors such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and ferricyanide. Cyt c accepts electrons
only from the FMN cofactor of nNOS, but ferricyanide accepts electrons
from both the FAD and FMN cofactors (Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information).71 Using
steady-state assays of cyt c and ferricyanide reduction,
as well as monitoring NADPH depletion and NO formation, electron flow
through the various NOS cofactors can be established. Exchange of
the FMN cofactor for 5-dFMN completely abolished steady-state cytochrome c reduction and NO formation and almost completely eliminated
NADPH consumption (∼1% activity remained in comparison with
native nNOS, which is attributed to reoxidation of nNOS-bound FADH2 by molecular oxygen).81 Ferricyanide
reduction is maintained in 5-dFMN nNOS (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), consistent with the known
ability of the FAD domain to transfer electrons to ferricyanide. That
activities known to be dependent on interflavin electron transfer
are abolished is consistent with our expectation that interflavin
electron transfer is blocked in 5-dFMN nNOS as a result of the very
unfavorable reduction potential for 5-dFMN semiquinone formation.66 This was further corroborated by anaerobic reductive
titration of native nNOS and 5-dFMN NOS with both NADPH (electrons
enter only via the FAD domain) and dithionite (DT), where electrons
can access each of the flavin/heme cofactors directly. With NADPH
(Figure S11 in the Supporting Information),
the absorbance changes are consistent with loss of oxidized flavin
and appearance of the blue flavin semiquinone species, which, as reported
previously, is a consequence of interflavin electron transfer following
initial reduction of FAD to FADH2 by NADPH.33,82 With 5-dFMN nNOS (reduced by NADPH), depletion of oxidized flavin
is observed, but there is minimal appearance of the blue semiquinone
signature. This is consistent with the expected block on electron
transfer to the FMN domain. In contrast, reductive titration with
DT (Figure S11) results in full reduction
(flavins and heme) of nNOS and 5-dFMN nNOS. These findings are consistent
with a variety of previously published papers that emphasize the different
redox chemistry of flavin and 5-deazaflavin66,67 in relation to semiquinone stabilization, which is an obligate intermediate
in the catalytic cycle of NOS.33

Internal
Electron Transfer Is Prevented in 5-dFMN nNOS
Similar to
the transient absorption stopped-flow studies of native
nNOS, we measured the single-turnover NADPH-dependent reduction of
5-dFMN nNOS by rapid mixing of oxidized 5-dFMN nNOS with excess NADPH
(20 mol equiv).33 Stopped-flow transients
measured over 10 s are shown in Figure 3. The blue shift in 5-dFMN spectral features allows
monitoring of the nNOS-bound FAD cofactor alone at 485 nm (and see
accompanying spectra recorded with a photodiode array in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). In
contrast to comparable experiments performed with nNOS (vide supra),
where flavin reduction was described by four kinetic phases over 10
s, in the case of 5-dFMN nNOS flavin reduction (monitored at 485 nm)
flavin reduction occurred in three kinetic phases. Observed rate constants
determined by fitting to a triple-exponential equation and associated
amplitude changes are similar to those recorded for the native enzyme
(k1 to k3).
The slower fourth phase seen for nNOS is absent in studies with 5-dFMN
NOS, consistent with the inability to transfer electrons from FAD
to 5-dFMN.

The slow fourth phase observed with nNOS has an observed
rate constant similar to that of kcat in
steady-state NO production and NADPH depletion assays (Table S1 in the Supporting Information). This
suggests that this kinetic phase contributes to rate limitation in
steady-state turnover, together with other established steps in the
catalytic cycle (notably FMN to heme electron transfer).18 We emphasize again that this is a kinetic phase
associated with an observed spectral change and does not report on
a single mechanistic step. As with other diflavin reductases such
as the well-characterized cytochrome P450 reductase,82 the kinetic phases observed for nNOS report on the formation
of a distribution of enzyme intermediates. In all likelihood, the
slow fourth phase reports not only on interflavin electron transfer
but also on FMN to heme electron transfer in a single kinetic process
(but heme reduction is not observed at the wavelength we monitored).
The finding that interflavin electron transfer is relatively slow
in nNOS is in line with a previous study on the isolated nNOS reductase
domain. This study suggested that interflavin electron transfer might
also be gated by NADP+ release,33 consistent with steady-state and isotope effect studies reported
by others.83

Over extended time scales
(200 s) stopped-flow studies with 5-dFMN
NOS also revealed an additional (fourth) kinetic phase (Figure 4D). This step has the same
kinetics as formation of the native nNOS “EQ state”
(∼0.01 s–1 for native and 5-dFMN nNOS), albeit
with a different associated amplitude (0.006 and −0.006 for
native and 5-dFMN nNOS). This “EQ state” has been discussed
in many studies with diflavin oxidoreductases as a signal that likely
results from further conformational change and/or further oxidation
of NADPH attributed to thermodynamic relaxation through disproportionation
reactions.33,82 The formal attribution of this
phase to mechanistic processes is complicated. It is not relevant
to steady-state catalysis and for that reason we have chosen not to
comment on it further in this work.

Correlating Conformational
Change with Early Steps in Electron
Transfer in 5-dFMN nNOS
With the availability of 5-dFMN NOS
we were able to investigate conformational changes linked to FAD reduction,
in the absence of electron transfer to the FMN and oxygenase domains.
Stopped-flow FRET data for the reaction between 5-dFMN nNOS-bound
to donor–acceptor labeled CaM and NADPH are shown in Figures 4C,D. Anti-correlated
donor and acceptor emission transients along with FRET data (i.e.,
the ratio of donor and acceptor emission) were optimally fit to four
exponential decays over 200 s. Rate constants associated with the
four phases are similar to those recorded for donor–acceptor
labeled CaM bound to native nNOS (Table 2). In addition, the directionality of conformational
change (i.e., “opening” and “closing”
of CaM) for 5-dFMN nNOS-bound CaM mimics that for nNOS. Some differences
in FRET amplitudes (degree of “opening” or “closing”)
between nNOS and 5-dFMN nNOS-bound CaM can be seen in the third and
fourth phases. In nNOS enzyme these phases are associated with the
kinetics of interflavin electron transfer and formation of the “EQ
state”, respectively.

The data indicate that interflavin
electron transfer/FMN reduction do not drive CaM conformational change,
as this step is blocked in 5-dFMN nNOS. We infer therefore that the
observed FRET conformational changes are associated with early steps
in the electron transfer sequence, which relate either to NADPH binding
and/or reduction of the FAD. We note that the extended C-terminal
tail of nNOS (and other NOS isoforms) needs to be displaced from the
NADPH binding site on mixing nNOS with NADPH61,71,79,84,85 and this might be a mechanism for connecting binding
and/or electron transfer events with the observed FRET signals that
report on intra-CaM motions.

NADP+ Binding Remodels the IntraCaM
landscape in
nNOS but over Longer Time Scales
We also investigated the
effects of coenzyme binding in the absence of nNOS reduction on the
modulation of the intra-CaM conformational landscape. In this case,
NADP+ was used rather than NADPH to prevent reduction of
nNOS flavins. Quenching of intrinsic nNOS tryptophan fluorescence
emission was used to monitor the binding of NADP+. By titrating
nNOS (bound to DA-T34C/T110C-CaM) with NADP+, we were able
to measure a dissociation constant, Kd, of 106 ± 27 μM for the enzyme–coenzyme complex.
By following Trp fluorescence in the stopped-flow instrument when
rapidly mixing saturating concentrations of NADP+ with
the nNOS DA-T34C/T110C-CaM complex, the observed rate of coenzyme
binding was obtained. The expected fluorescence changes associated
with coenzyme–enzyme interaction occurred within the dead time
(1.5 ms) of the stopped-flow instrument (Figure 5). Consequently, and in line with other diflavin
oxidoreductases,12 we conclude that NADP+ binding to nNOS is rapid (>500 s–1 at
10
°C).

instrument. (A) Fluorescence emission changes of the nNOS tryptophans

black trace represents the mixing of the nNOS:CaM complex with buffer
alone, while red and blue are labeled accordingly with the final NADP+ concentrations used in the stopped-flow study. (B) Static
titration data (black) and the emission changes recorded in the dead

Data in (B) were fitted to a hyperbolic binding function, which gives
an apparent Kd value for the nNOS:CaM–NADP+ complex of 106 ± 27 μM.

To study the effects of NADP+ binding on nNOS-bound
intra-CaM dynamics, donor–acceptor fluorophore labeled-T34C/T110C-CaM
bound to 1 molar equiv of nNOS was mixed with saturating concentrations
of NADP+. FRET stopped-flow transients representing the
nNOS-bound intra-CaM dynamics for the reaction between NADP+ and equimolar concentrations of nNOS and T34C/T110C-CaM are shown
in Figure 6. No FRET
changes were observed in the dead time of the stopped-flow instrument,
indicating that there are no binding induced nNOS-bound CaM conformational
changes. However, conformational change was observed only over extended
time scales (up to 200 s) and transients reporting on nNOS-bound CaM
conformational change were analyzed using a double-exponential function
(Figure 6). The two
observed kinetic phases have rate constants similar in value to k3 and k4 recorded
for CaM dynamics in NADPH-reduced native and 5-dFMN nNOS (Table 2 and Table S4 in the Supporting Information). The response to NADP+ binding is therefore different from that observed in stopped-flow
studies with NADPH, where CaM dynamics were observed on shorter time
scales and were associated with NADPH binding and FAD reduction. This
suggests either (i) that the mode of interaction of NADP+ and NADPH with nNOS is sufficiently different so as to elicit different
responses in the remodelling of the CaM landscape or (ii) that redox
changes in the FAD are also required to drive the relatively fast
remodeling of the CaM landscape in stopped-flow studies of nNOS reduction
with NADPH. Either way, it is clear that NADPH binding/FAD reduction
is the primary trigger for the remodeling CaM rather than internal
electron transfer to FMN/heme.

Concluding Remarks
It has been known for some time that ligand–protein interactions
affect the conformational landscape of enzyme molecules.14,86 Ligand-induced conformational changes have been documented previously
in the diflavin oxidoreductase family and by NADP+ binding
in nNOS.20 Moreover, crystallographic studies
of NOS and other diflavin oxidoreductases have also implicated a role
for ligand-induced conformational change in these enzymes, particularly
in relation to conformational sampling of the FMN binding domain in
relation to the FAD and oxygenase domains (i.e., the so-called “input”
and “output” states of nNOS).

A major and largely
unmet challenge has been the need to correlate
protein motions (i.e., in real time) across the catalytic cycle so
that a more holistic understanding of the role of dynamics in enzyme
mechanisms can be inferred. In this paper we have begun to address
this limitation by correlating the dynamics of CaM bound to the reaction
chemistry of nNOS during what is a highly complex reaction cycle.
This has enabled us to pinpoint major conformational changes in CaM
as a function of time to correlate these changes with specific chemical
steps in the reaction cycle and identify/suggest the mechanistic triggers
for these major conformational adjustments. This extends appreciably
our current understanding of nNOS dynamics inferred from structural,
single-molecule, EPR, electron microscopy, and kinetic approaches,
and it paves the way for similar analyses on other complex redox systems
where knowledge of dynamics in relation to chemistry is important
in advancing the mechanistic description of catalysis.

Our analysis
has shown that major remodeling of the CaM landscape
occurs during early phases of electron transfer during the NADPH-dependent
reduction of nNOS. A combination of isotope effects, FRET studies,
and use of 5-dFMN to block internal electron transfer has enabled
more precise mapping of kinetic phases observed in stopped-flow experiments
to domain-specific redox changes. Although these phases cannot be
attributed to a single mechanistic step, we have demonstrated that
binding and/or redox changes associated with the FAD domain are correlated
with major remodeling of the bound CaM in nNOS. This remodeling is
likely triggered in part through displacement of the C-terminal tail
from the NADPH binding site by the incoming nicotinamide coenzyme,
but other factors might also be in play. The approaches we have developed
should find wider application in related studies with NOS isoforms,
where simplification of the reaction chemistry and strategic positioning
of fluorescence reporters can be used to inform not only on the dynamics
of CaM but also on the relative orientations and time-dependent conformational
remodeling of other domains in NOS enzymes.
