Ceria-supported Pd
is a promising heterogeneous catalyst for CO
oxidation relevant to environmental cleanup reactions. Pd loaded onto
a nanorod form of ceria exposing predominantly (111) facets is already
active at 50 °C. Here we report a combination of CO-FTIR spectroscopy
and theoretical calculations that allows assigning different forms
of Pd on the CeO2(111) surface during reaction conditions.
Single Pd atoms stabilized in the form of PdO and PdO2 in
a CO/O2 atmosphere participate in a catalytic cycle involving
very low activation barriers for CO oxidation. The presence of single
Pd atoms on the Pd/CeO2-nanorod, corroborated by aberration-corrected
TEM and CO-FTIR spectroscopy, is considered pivotal to its high CO
oxidation activity.

Three-way catalysts for automotive
exhaust emissions convert harmful gases such as CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons into harmless gases. The catalyst
layer contains platinum, rhodium, and palladium on alumina and ceria-zirconia
carriers.1,2 Palladium can replace the more expensive
platinum and is, in combination with ceria, essential for low-temperature
oxidation performance of CO and hydrocarbons.3,4 Thermal
sintering of the Pd atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles via Ostwald
ripening is the cause of deactivation of these catalysts during prolonged
operation.5,6 The synergy between palladium and ceria
is relevant to several chemical reactions.3,4,6,7 For low-temperature
CO oxidation, high dispersion of palladium on the ceria surface appears
to be crucial.8 It is usually assumed that
metallic Pd clusters and nanoparticles are the active components for
CO oxidation. There is, however, increasing evidence that single atoms
or very small clusters of Au, Pt, and Rh have distinct advantages
in CO oxidation catalysis, especially in connection with ceria as
a carrier that can easily supply oxygen atoms.9,10 Many
of these studies made use of novel preparation methods to increase
the amount of isolated or highly dispersed metal atoms on the support.11,12 For instance, Flytzani-Stephanopoulos used cyanide-leaching to remove
metallic Au particles from Au/CeO2, with the remaining
gold cations interacting strongly with ceria and displaying high activity
in CO oxidation and the water–gas shift reaction.13 The same group emphasized the role of single
Pt atoms stabilized by alkali ions in obtaining highly active CO oxidation
catalysts.14 On the contrary, Stair et
al. reported that single Pt atoms supported on TiO2 and
SiO2 are not active in low-temperature CO oxidation, as
they bind CO too strongly. Instead, very small subnanometer Pt clusters
were identified as the active phase for CO oxidation.15 Datye and co-workers recently demonstrated that volatile
Pt-oxides can be trapped on ceria in ionic form at high temperature.
The resulting catalysts contain atomically dispersed Pt with high
thermal stability, because the metal atoms are trapped in stable binding
sites of ceria.16 However, these ionic
Pt sites are not active for low-temperature CO oxidation in agreement
with the results from the Stair group.

In contrast, much higher
CO oxidation activity was demonstrated
by highly dispersed Rh-oxide clusters supported on ceria compared
with metallic Rh particles.17 Quantum-chemical
calculations show how lattice O atoms of ceria are involved in the
catalytic cycle of CO oxidation by such Rh-oxide clusters.18 Likewise, it was proposed that isolated Pd oxide
supported on La-modified alumina was more active than metallic metal
clusters.19 These isolated Pd species transformed
easily into metallic Pd particles, losing catalytic activity.

Although Pd/CeO2 is known to be active and stable for
low-temperature CO oxidation, the nature of the active sites has not
been conclusively established. Here, we will show that, during low
temperature CO oxidation, Pd can be stabilized as single atoms on
the (111) facet of ceria using conventional preparation techniques.
Such high dispersion of Pt and Pd by simple wet impregnation can for
instance also be achieved on an alumina support.19,20 As mentioned before, also CeO2 can stabilize single noble
metal atoms on its surface.16 In our case,
these Pd atoms are stable under reaction conditions and contribute
substantially to the CO oxidation activity of Pd/CeO2.
We selected nanostructured ceria nanorods, because they expose prominent
(111) facets, which are the most stable surfaces of ceria.21 We loaded this support with 1 wt % Pd using
its nitrate salt by incipient wetness impregnation followed by calcination
at 300 °C in air. Figure 1a shows the CO oxidation activity as a function of the temperature
for the blank CeO2-rods and the Pd/CeO2-rods.
While the support alone shows negligible activity at low temperature,
the Pd/CeO2-rod catalyst is able to achieve full CO conversion
at temperatures as low as 125 °C. Notably, Pd/CeO2-rod is already active at 50 °C, a temperature which we will
employ below to study the catalytic surface by IR spectroscopy after
adsorption of CO. The higher catalytic activity of CeO2 nanorods-based catalysts compared to other CeO2 nanostructures
in many reactions has already been reported by many research groups.
Soler et al. demonstrated that a higher activity in CO oxidation can
be obtained by depositing noble metals on CeO2 nanorods,
rather than on nanocubes or other nanostructures.22 Wu et al. studied the CO oxidation activity of bare CeO2 nanostructures and confirmed that nanorods have a higher
activity compared to nanocubes and polyhedra.23 Peng et al. showed that rod-shaped Pt/CeO2 was remarkably
more active than cube-shaped Pt/CeO2 or polyhedra-shaped
Pt/CeO2 in toluene oxidation.24 Hsiao et al. studied Rh/CeO2 and determined that rod-shaped
catalysts show higher activity in ethanol reforming and higher hydrogen
selectivity.25

CeO2-rods and (red) Pd/CeO2-rod, (b) AC-TEM
image of CeO2 nanorods showing
exposed (111) facets, (c) AC-TEM image of Pd/CeO2-rod after
air calcination at 300 °C showing the absence of particles, and
(d) AC-TEM image of the Pd/CeO2-rod sample after reduction
at 300 °C showing a well-defined metallic Pd nanoparticle.

To investigate the origin of the
high reactivity of Pd/ceria nanorods
we utilized aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy
(AC-STEM) of 2 wt % Pd. Figure 1b shows bare ceria nanorods confirming the exposed (111) facet. Figure 1c shows that no Pd
clusters or particles were observed on ceria nanorods in their oxidized
state, after calcination in air at 300 °C. This strongly suggests
that Pd is present in highly dispersed form on the nanorod-shaped
ceria support. There is a complete absence of any three-dimensional
structures of PdO, and the atomically dispersed PdO is not easy to
image due to low contrast compared with the high atomic number ceria
support. The presence of a highly dispersed Pd phase is corroborated
by EXAFS, which shows the lack of Pd–Pd coordination in the
oxidized catalyst (see Supporting Information). In contrast, when the Pd/ceria nanorod is subjected to reducing
environments at 300 °C, we observe well-defined Pd nanoparticles
on the ceria surface (Figure 1d).

We employed in situ transmission FTIR spectroscopy
to characterize
the palladium phase in the Pd/CeO2-rod sample using CO
as a probe molecule. The sample as a self-supporting pellet was first
calcined at 300 °C in O2, evacuated, and then cooled
to 50 °C. Figure 2 shows IR spectra with increasing CO pressure (CO administered as
pulses). The initial spectrum contains bands at 2138, 2090, and 1975
cm–1 as well as a broad band below 1900 cm–1. The intensity of most of these bands increases with CO pressure.
The strongest increase is observed for the 2090 cm–1 band, which shifts to 2086 cm–1. The band at 2138
cm–1 quickly disappears after a few CO pulses. We
speculate that these changes are due to the reduction of a Pd-oxide
phase into metallic Pd structures. The bands at 1950 cm–1 and in the 1850–1900 cm–1 region can be
assigned to bridge and 3-fold adsorbed CO on metallic Pd, respectively.26−28 The band at 2086 cm–1 has been assigned before
to linearly adsorbed CO on a highly dispersed electron-deficient Pd
phase in strong interaction with CeO2.4,26 DFT
calculations show that CO adsorption on Pd clusters can give rise
to such vibrational frequencies (see the Supporting Information). CO2 is also formed during exposure
to CO, indicating that CO reduces the catalytic surface already at
50 °C.

Figure 2 IR spectra of incremental doses of CO on calcined Pd/CeO2-rod catalyst at 50 °C (arrow indicates increasing CO pressure)
and after CO adsorption at 50 °C on Pd/CeO2-rod reduced
at 300 °C in H2 (blue line).

The CO FTIR spectrum of the same catalyst reduced in H2 at 300 °C (blue spectrum in Figure 2) is different: pronounced bands at 2065
cm–1, 1950 cm–1 and at lower wavenumbers
due to linear and bridge-bonded CO on extended Pd metal surfaces (see
the Supporting Information) emphasize the
formation of larger particles in comparison to the case where the
catalyst was reduced in CO at 50 °C. Figure 1d shows confirmation of this change through
the formation of well-defined metallic nanoparticles on the ceria
surface. The bands at 2160 and 2125 cm–1 can be
assigned to electronic transitions of Ce3+ surface states,
generated during the reduction process.29,30

After
showing that CO is able to reduce the PdO phase at 50 °C,
we carried out a similar infrared experiment in which the sample was
exposed to increasing amounts of CO in the presence of 2 mbar O2 (Figure 3).
The obtained FTIR spectra look very different and are characterized
by increasing intensities of bands at 2143 cm–1 (composite
with a shoulder around 2120 cm–1), a band at 2098
cm–1 with a shoulder at 2056 cm–1, and a very broad band around 1900 cm–1. The band
at 2143 cm–1 relates to a surface intermediate,
as the typical rotational–vibrational spectrum of gaseous CO
is not observed. At the same time, we observe much more pronounced
CO2 evolution as compared with the O2-free experiment,
which demonstrates that the Pd species present in an O2 atmosphere are significantly more active for CO oxidation. We hypothesize
that the bands around 2143 and 2098 cm–1 are associated
with sites that are active for low-temperature CO oxidation. We initially
assigned the shoulder at 2056 cm–1 and the broad
band around 1900 cm–1 to a small amount of metallic
Pd particles that could not be oxidized under these conditions, but
we will later see that these bands are most likely due to small metallic
clusters covered with O atoms.

Figure 3 IR spectra of incremental doses of CO
on the Pd/CeO2-rod catalyst at 50 °C. The catalyst
was previously in situ
calcined at 300 °C, cooled to 50 °C in an O2-atmosphere
followed by lowering the O2 pressure to 2 mbar followed
by CO pulses. The inserts show DFT-optimized structure of CO on different
Pd configuration on CeO2(111) (color scheme: red, surface
O; orange, subsurface O; white, surface Ce; pink, O of adsorbed species;
blue, Pd).

Density functional theory was
used to model the CeO2(111) surface, candidate overlayer
structures of Pd, and stretching
frequencies of adsorbed CO as well as possible reaction mechanisms
for CO oxidation. These calculations were performed using the GGA-PBE
electron exchange-correlation functional including a Hubbard-like
term to describe the on-site Coulombic interaction to improve the
description of the localized states for the Ce 4f orbital. As AC-STEM
shows the absence of three-dimensional Pd structures (Figure 1c), implying the existence
of dispersed Pd species, we first explored CO adsorption on a single
Pd atom on the stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface. We report
scaled vibrational CO frequencies. In this way, we find νCO = 2047 cm–1 for CO on Pd/CeO2(111), νCO = 2098 cm–1 for CO
on PdO/CeO2(111), and νCO = 2137 cm–1 for CO on PdO2/CeO2(111). PdO3/CeO2(111) does not adsorb CO. Thus, PdO and PdO2 are candidate structures giving rise to the two bands observed
in the FTIR spectrum under CO oxidation conditions at 50 °C.
Estimating Helmholtz free energies (A) by using A = U – TS ≈ EDFT – TSO2 for PdO x /CeO2(111) shows that the stability order is PdO2 > PdO (+ 34 kJ/mol) > Pd (+ 42 kJ/mol) > PdO3 (+
152 kJ/mol) in gaseous O2 at 50 °C (EDFT: electronic energy computed by DFT; entropy of solids
neglected). This comparison renders Pd, PdO, and PdO2 on
CeO2(111) candidate structures for exploring a catalytic
cycle for CO oxidation. We also calculated the CO adsorption frequencies
on other Pd structures. CO adsorption on a periodic Pd(111) surface,
which serves as a model for surface of nanoparticles, gives rise to
bands at 2056, 1868, and 1789 cm–1 for top, bridge,
and 3-fold adsorbed CO, respectively. Corresponding CO adsorption
configurations on a Pd10 cluster placed on the CeO2(111) surface occur at nearly similar frequencies. We also
considered a very small cluster consisting of three Pd atoms and determined
by ab initio thermodynamic analysis that it will be present in the
form of Pd3O during CO oxidation (see the Supporting Information). When CO is bridge-bonded on the Pd3O cluster, frequencies between 1900 and 1950 cm–1 are computed depending on CO coverage. Accordingly, we surmise that
the experimentally observed weak band around 1907 cm–1 is due to bridge-adsorbed CO on a small amount of metallic clusters
to which O atoms are adsorbed.

We then explored different mechanisms
of CO oxidation on single
atom Pd models supported on CeO2(111). CO adsorbs strongly
on PdO with ΔE = −90 kJ/mol (Figure 4). The formation
of CO2 by reaction of adsorbed CO with the O atom bridging
between Pd and Ce4+ is very facile (ΔEact = 29 kJ/mol; ΔEact: activation barrier). Desorption of CO2 costs 31 kJ/mol.
The resulting single Pd atom is slightly positively charged. According
to our calculations at the PBE+U level, the energy difference between
Pd0 on the stoichiometric CeO2(111) surface
and the state where one electron of Pd reduces one Ce4+ ion to Ce3+ is very small. The cycle can then proceed
by adsorption of CO or O2. We first considered the adsorption
of CO on the Pd atom (ΔE = −152 kJ/mol).
The reaction of adsorbed CO with a ceria lattice O atom is too difficult.
The barrier ΔEact = 110 kJ/mol
is inconsistent with the low-temperature activity of the Pd/CeO2-rod sample. Moreover, the formed CO2 molecule
remains strongly adsorbed to the ceria (ΔE =
93 kJ/mol). The single Pd atom can also be oxidized by O2 from the gas phase or by a lattice O atom of ceria. The latter reaction
is endothermic, whereas it is exothermic for single Rh atoms dispersed
on CeO2(111).18 The difference
relates to the higher d-orbital occupancy of the Pd atom, rendering
O adsorption weaker. Accordingly, dissociative adsorption of O2 on the single Pd atom is more likely, as it is strongly exothermic
by ΔE = −107 kJ/mol. In the resulting
PdO2 configuration, the Pd atom is in the +3 oxidation
state. Adsorption of CO to the PdO2 surface intermediate
is exothermic by ΔE = −53 kJ/mol. The
activation barrier for formation of CO2 from the PdO2–CO complex is only ΔEact = 38 kJ/mol. Desorption of the second CO2 molecule costs
40 kJ/mol. The last step regenerates the initial PdO species and thereby
closes the catalytic cycle.

Figure 4 Helmholtz free-energy diagram of the catalytic
cycle for CO oxidation
on a single Pd atom on the CeO2(111) surface (IM = intermediate;
TS = transition state; color scheme: red, surface O; orange, subsurface
O; white, surface Ce; pink, O of O2 and CO; blue, Pd).

In determining which states along
the reaction coordinate may be
expected to dominate under typical reaction conditions, we constructed
a Helmholtz free-energy diagram (Figure 4). We neglected the entropies of the solids
in this analysis. The resulting energy diagram emphasizes that the
transition states of the two CO oxidation events (IM2 → IM3
and IM6 → IM7) are the only endergonic states along the reaction
coordinate. The two endothermic CO2 desorption steps are
exergonic because of the entropy gain associated with the release
of CO2 into the gas phase. This simple analysis predicts
CO-PdO/CeO2(111) and CO-PdO2/CeO2(111) to be the major reaction intermediates during CO oxidation.
These intermediates are identified by their respective CO signatures
at 2137 and 2096 cm–1, respectively, which can be
matched with the experimentally observed spectral features at 2143
and 2098 cm–1, respectively.

In order to gain
insight into the stability of oxidized single
Pd atoms, we determined energy barriers for the diffusion of Pd and
PdO2 on the CeO2(111) surface. The potential
energy diagrams are provided in the Supporting Information. While Pd can freely diffuse on the surface (ΔEact = 6 kJ/mol), PdO2 is much more
strongly bonded to the support. The resulting diffusion barrier of
88 kJ/mol illustrates its resistance against sintering. Finally, we
compared the thermodynamic stability of a range of Pdn clusters (n = 2–21), Pd
and PdO2 on CeO2(111). The result shows that
under reducing conditions Pdn clusters
are more stable than isolated Pd. On the contrary, in the presence
of oxygen dispersion of Pdn clusters into
isolated PdO2 species is favorable, explaining the high
Pd dispersion discussed in this work.

In summary, we focused
on an intentionally nanostructured catalyst
containing single Pd sites on CeO2 nanorods that expose
(111) facets. We investigated the reaction mechanism of CO oxidation
by means of a combination of experimental techniques, such as aberration-corrected
TEM which helps define the structure of the Pd sites and CO-FTIR which
shows the nature of the adsorbed CO. The theoretical calculations
allowed us to precisely assign each infrared band with the help of
DFT calculations, to evaluate the entire catalytic mechanism and to
prove the existence of single Pd sites in our catalyst. These single
Pd sites play an essential role in the low-temperature CO oxidation
reaction. The presence of single sites in the Pd/CeO2-rod
sample, which was assessed by the combination of AC-TEM and FTIR,
helps to explain the high activity for the CO oxidation reaction at
temperatures where metallic Pd is inactive because of CO poisoning.
