The
Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis converts synthesis gas from
alternative carbon resources, including natural gas, coal, and biomass,
to hydrocarbons used as fuels or chemicals. In particular, iron-based
catalysts at elevated temperatures favor the selective production
of C2–C4 olefins, which are important
building blocks for the chemical industry. Bulk iron catalysts (with
promoters) were conventionally used, but these deactivate due to either
phase transformation or carbon deposition resulting in disintegration
of the catalyst particles. For supported iron catalysts, iron particle
growth may result in loss of catalytic activity over time. In this
work, the effects of promoters and particle size on the stability
of supported iron nanoparticles (initial sizes of 3–9 nm) were
investigated at industrially relevant conditions (340 °C, 20
bar, H2/CO = 1). Upon addition of sodium and sulfur promoters
to iron nanoparticles supported on carbon nanofibers, initial catalytic
activities were high, but substantial deactivation was observed over
a period of 100 h. In situ Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed
that after 20 h time-on-stream, promoted catalysts attained 100% carbidization,
whereas for unpromoted catalysts, this was around 25%. In situ carbon
deposition studies were carried out using a tapered element oscillating
microbalance (TEOM). No carbon laydown was detected for the unpromoted
catalysts, whereas for promoted catalysts, carbon deposition occurred
mainly over the first 4 h and thus did not play a pivotal role in
deactivation over 100 h. Instead, the loss of catalytic activity coincided
with the increase in Fe particle size to 20–50 nm, thereby
supporting the proposal that the loss of active Fe surface area was
the main cause of deactivation.

Introduction
The Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis (FTS) is a catalytic surface
polymerization reaction which converts synthesis gas (CO and H2) into valuable hydrocarbons, such as lower olefins.1 Synthesis gas can be produced from a wide array
of carbon sources including natural gas, coal, and biomass, and product
selectivity toward chemicals and fuels can be adjusted by catalyst
design, which makes this a flexible option to the industry.2−5

Iron-based FT catalysts are favored due to their low cost,
high
abundance, low methane formation, and useful water–gas shift
(WGS) activity.6−9 Bulk Fe catalysts (often modified with promoters and synthesized
via coprecipitation or sintering) were extensively studied and displayed
promising results, but these suffered from poor mechanical stability.10 Carbon formation which occurs via the Boudouard
reaction (2 CO → C + CO2), leads to blocking of
active sites and disintegration of catalyst particles. To improve
on the mechanical properties of Fe-based catalysts, dispersing Fe
nanoparticles on supports was attempted. A concern to the use of oxidic
supports, such as silica and high surface area alumina, is the inhibition
of critical phase transformation to active Fe carbide species due
to strong support–metal interactions.11 Thus, weakly interacting supports such as nanostructured carbon
materials and low surface area alumina were preferred for supported
Fe FT catalysts.12−15

Earlier research showed that sodium and sulfur promoters,
as well
as the particle size of iron nanoparticles supported on the carbon
nanofibers (CNF), affect the activity and selectivity of lower olefins.16 This breakthrough in increasing the lower olefins
selectivity made the direct production of lower olefins from synthesis
gas (Fischer–Tropsch to olefins, FTO) a more attractive option.
However, the stability of the improved Fe FT catalysts remained a
challenge.

Deactivation of Fe FT catalysts could be due to Fe
particle growth
and/or carbon deposition, and/or transformation of active Fe carbide
species into inactive Fe carbide/oxide/metallic species.17−20 Sintering, either via Ostwald ripening or particle migration and
coalescence, results in loss of active Fe carbide surface area, and
thereby loss of catalytic activity. Phase transformation and carbon
deposition are speculated to be the main causes of deactivation for
bulk Fe catalysts,21−28 while the surface chemistry of support material dictates the deactivation
mechanism for supported Fe catalysts. Fe nanoparticles supported on
oxidic supports were stable due to strong support–metal interactions,
hence sintering and phase transformations were not expected, and C
deposition was likely to be the dominant cause for activity loss.29,30 Conversely, Fe nanoparticles supported on weakly interacting supports
were prone to Fe particle growth.31−33 Because the mode of
deactivation is affected by the support material, there are different
strategies to improve catalytic stability by means of proper support
selection. Carbon supports are widely used, and to improve on the
catalytic stability, catalyst design has been focused on encapsulating
Fe nanoparticles to prevent Fe particle growth.34,35

In this work, the aim is to comprehend the effect of iron
particle
size and the presence or absence of promoters on catalyst stability.
Various causes of deactivation, such as Fe phase transformations,
carbon deposition, and Fe particle growth will be assessed. To eliminate
the contribution from oxidic supports, carbon nanofibers were used
to support the iron nanoparticles. Iron nanoparticles supported on
CNF with/without Na and S promoters were prepared via incipient wetness
impregnation. By varying the loading of iron between 2 to 20 wt %,
iron oxide nanoparticles between 3–9 nm were obtained. Catalytic
tests were performed to determine the catalytic activity, selectivity,
and stability. The as-synthesized and spent catalysts were characterized
ex situ by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In situ Mössbauer
spectroscopy was used to characterize the iron phases under FTO conditions.
A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) was used to monitor
the rate of carbon deposited during the FTO process.36

Experimental Methods
Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
Growth
of CNF Support
A 5 wt % Ni/SiO2 catalyst
(sieve fraction of 425–825 μm) was synthesized via homogeneous
deposition precipitation as reported previously.37 Five grams of the catalyst was reduced under the flow of
190 mL/min H2 and 625 mL/min N2 at a pressure
of 2.8 bar and 700 °C for 2 h (5 °C/min). Temperature was
lowered to 550 °C (3.5 °C/min) after reduction, and carbon
nanofibers with fishbone structure were grown by flowing diluted syngas
with the composition of 102 mL/min H2, 266 mL/min CO, and
450 mL/min N2 for 24 h. To remove SiO2, the
CNF grown was refluxed thrice in 400 mL of 1 M KOH followed by washing
with demineralized water to pH 7. To remove Ni and to introduce oxygen-containing
groups on the surface, the purified CNF was refluxed in 400 mL of
65% HNO3 for 1.5 h followed by washing with demineralized water to
pH 7.

Preparation of Unpromoted Supported Catalysts
Four
unpromoted catalysts with different iron loadings (2, 5, 10, 20 wt
% Fe) were prepared using incipient wetness impregnation as described
previously.16 In the initial step, 7.014
g ammonium iron citrate (Fluka, purum p.a., 14.5–16 wt % Fe)
was dissolved in 25 mL of demineralized water to form a stock solution.
Depending on the iron loading, different volumes of this stock solution
were impregnated onto CNF to achieve the desired loading. Except for
the 2 wt % Fe-loaded catalyst, every catalyst required successive
impregnation steps. The samples were dried under static air at 120
°C between impregnation steps and after the final impregnation
step for 1 and 2 h, respectively. Heat treatment was performed at
500 °C for 2 h (5 °C/min; 100 mL/min for 2 g catalyst) under
the nitrogen flow. After it was cooled to room temperature, the catalyst
was passivated by controlled surface oxidation. The oxygen concentration
was increased stepwise (2% v/v increase every 30 min) until reaching
20% v/v. The number in the sample code indicates the surface area-average
particle size of iron nanoparticles measured by TEM.

Preparation
of Promoted Supported Catalysts
Four promoted
catalysts with different iron loadings (2, 5, 10, 20 wt % Fe) were
prepared using incipient wetness impregnation as described above.
The determined promoter loading is shown in Table 1. Initially, 6.954 g of ammonium iron citrate
(Fluka, purum p.a., 14.5–16 wt % Fe), 0.199 g of sodium citrate
tribasic dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, > 99.0%), and 0.056 g of iron(II)
sulfate heptahydrate (Merck) were dissolved in 25 mL of demineralized
water to form a stock solution. Subsequent steps were performed as
described above. In addition to the number in the sample code which
indicates the surface area-average particle size of Fe2O3 nanoparticles measured by TEM, the letter P was included
to identify promoted catalysts.

Characterization
TEM was used to determine the iron
particle size distribution and the spatial distribution of iron nanoparticles
on the support. At least 300 iron nanoparticles per catalyst were
measured to obtain an average particle size. The images were attained
with a Philips Tecnai-20 FEG (200 kV) microscope equipped with an
EDX and HAADF detector. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements
were carried out with a Micromeritics AutoChem II equipped with a
TCD detector. Relevant reduction conditions were used (i.e., 350 °C
(5 °C/min), 5% H2 in Ar, 2 h). The composition of
the Fe phases before reaction, after reduction, and after FTO reaction
was determined in situ with transmission 57Fe Mössbauer
spectroscopy. Transmission 57Fe Mössbauer spectra
were collected at 300 and 4.2 K with a sinusoidal velocity spectrometer
using a 57Co(Rh) source. Velocity calibration was carried
out using an α-Fe foil. The source and the absorbing samples
were kept at the same temperature during the measurements. The Mössbauer
spectra were fitted using the Mosswinn 4.0 program.38 The experiments were performed in a state-of-the-art high-pressure
Mössbauer in situ cell—recently developed at Reactor
Institute Delft.39 The high-pressure beryllium
windows used in this cell contain 0.08% Fe impurity, and its spectral
contribution was fitted and removed from the final spectra. The Mössbauer
transmission cell has a tubular reaction chamber with an internal
diameter of 15 mm, and the catalyst bed lengths were 1.5–3
mm (catalyst loading of 100–300 mg). Although the reactant
gases pass through the catalyst bed, the Mössbauer cell is
not a plug-flow reactor due to a large dead volume (∼7 cm3) before the catalyst bed. A total flow rate of 100 mL/min
was used during treatments, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity
(GHSV) of about 12 000–24 000 h–1. The reaction conditions were as described in the catalytic tests
below.

Catalyst Performance
Catalytic experiments
were performed
using high throughput fixed-bed reactors as described elsewhere.40 The catalysts were first reduced in situ at
340 °C (5 °C/min), 3 bar, He/H2 = 2, GHSV = 7200
h–1 for 2 h. Synthesis gas mixture (H2/CO/He = 45/45/10) was introduced at 280 °C and 3 bar, and temperature
and pressure were subsequently increased over 0.5 h to 340 °C
and 20 bar. Two different gas hourly space velocities (GHSV) were
employed, specifically 7200 h–1 and 54 000 h–1 for mimicking industrially relevant conditions and
C deposition test conditions, respectively. A blank experiment using
CNF support showed zero activity under relevant FTO conditions. Catalytic
activity, expressed as iron time yield (FTY), was expressed as moles
of CO converted per gram of Fe per second. CO conversion (%) was calculated
as 1  Where CCO, R and CHe,R correspond to concentration
of CO and He at the reactor outlet, respectively. CHe,blk and CCO, blk correspond
to concentrations of CO and He at the outlet of the blank reactor.
The product selectivity to hydrocarbons up to C9 was determined
with online gas chromatography (GC) and was calculated on a carbon
atom basis. Selectivity toward CO2 was also measured. This
analysis method is consistent with previous literature.16

C Deposition
Carbon deposition was
measured using a
TEOM (TEOM series 1500 Pulse Mass Analyzer, Rupprecht & Patashnick
Co.,Inc.).36 The procedure started with
flushing the tapered element with N2 at room temperature
and pressure. The pressure and temperature were increased to 2 bar
and 340 °C (10 °C/min) respectively. The resulting decrease
in gas density was reflected by a decrease in the mass signal. Upon
stabilization of the mass signal which took ∼4 h, the gas feed
was switched to a mixture of N2 and H2, resulting
in a sharp decrease in the mass signal. Each catalyst was reduced
at 2 bar, 340 °C, N2/H2 = 2, and GHSV =
54 000 h–1 for 2 h, and this reduction step was
apparent from the gradual decrease in the mass signal. After reduction,
the gas feed was switched from N2 and H2 mixture
to pure N2 to determine the mass loss during reduction.
Stabilization of the mass signal was again needed (∼0.5 h)
before synthesis gas feed was introduced. C deposition was monitored
for 4 h at 340 °C, 20 bar, CO/H2 = 1, and GHSV = 54
000 h–1. Finally, the feed was switched back to
pure N2 gas feed after 4 h of synthesis gas exposure. The
CNF support was also tested in a blank experiment and no mass difference
was observed during reduction and Fischer–Tropsch reaction.
To prevent accumulation of hydrocarbon products in the catalyst bed,
a high GHSV was required. As the quartz element may break due to an
increase in the catalyst volume from coking, time-on-stream (TOS)
was limited to 4 h.

Tables 2 and 3 summarize the activity and product selectivity
of these supported Fe catalysts at low conversions during the initial
period (TOS = 12 h) and steady state (TOS = 100 h), respectively.
Activity and product selectivity of these supported Fe catalysts at
high conversions are included in SI 3.
Data in Table 2 show
that the addition of promoters resulted in increased activity and
product selectivity for CO2, C2–C4 olefins, and C5+ hydrocarbons,16 and these promoted catalysts exhibited stable product selectivities
after 12 h on-stream (Table 3). Product selectivities were influenced by various factors,
for example, CO conversion and Fe particle size at different times
on-stream.

Figure 1 shows the
catalytic activity as a function of time, thereby providing insights
in the stability of these catalysts at high temperature and pressure.
The unpromoted catalysts had the lowest catalytic activity during
the initial period. On the other hand, the promoted catalysts had
the highest catalytic activity during the initial period, but catalytic
activity decreased over time (Figure 1b). It is noted that the catalytic activity after 100
h on-stream of promoted and unpromoted catalysts was similar, except
for 3Fe(P). Formation of different Fe species, carbon accumulation,
and Fe particle growth are possible causes of deactivation, and these
were further investigated.

Figure 1 Iron time yield (FTY) of (a) unpromoted catalysts
and (b) promoted
catalysts (340 °C, 20 bar, H2/CO/He = 45/45/10, and
GHSV = 54 000 h–1).

In situ Mössbauer spectroscopy determined quantitatively
the various Fe species present during reduction and FTO conditions.
Upon reduction, 25 mol % Fe carbide species were measured for both
4FeP and 4Fe (Figures 2a,c and SI 4). It is thus suggested that
the addition of promoters did not have a significant influence on
the reduction step. This observation was confirmed by the similar
TPR profiles obtained for 4PFe and 4Fe (Figure S10). To further investigate the reduction behavior of a promoted
catalyst (7PFe), Mössbauer spectra were measured after 2 and
24 h reduction (Ar/H2 = 2, 350 °C, 2 bar). Despite
the longer reduction duration, incomplete reduction was observed and
similar content of Fe carbide phase was measured (Table S8 and Figure S11). However, after 20 h of FTO conditions,
4FeP was fully carburized and 4Fe had only 23 mol % Fe carbide species
(Figures 2b,d and SI 4). The remaining Fe atoms were present as
Fe2+ species having Mössbauer spectra similar to
those of Wüstite and its nonstoichiometric equivalent (Fe1–xO).41 The promoters induced formation of more Fe carbide species in the
initial period, which gave higher catalytic activity. Alkali promoters
such as Na are known to increase Fe carburization rate,42 but the addition of S showed the opposite effect.43 It is noted that 4FeP had four times more Fe
carbide species, but its catalytic activity was only twice higher
than 4Fe.

carbide: magenta, red, and purple; 1 Fe site for ε′ carbide:
dark cyan; 3–4 Fe sites for Fe1–xO: violet, olive, navy, blue).

Carbon deposition over time was monitored in situ using the
TEOM.
No carbon deposition was measured during 4 h for the unpromoted catalysts
with different particle sizes (Figure S12), and it is proposed to be due to the lack of active χ-Fe5C2 phase. This proposal was supported by in situ
Mössbauer spectroscopy data (Figure 2) and catalyst performance data. The promoted
catalysts showed carbon accumulation over time (Figure S13). During the early stages (first 30 min approximately),
there were two opposite occurrences for mass changes which resulted
in a negligible net mass change. Further reduction of Fe oxide species
to Fe carbide species caused a decrease in mass, while carbon laydown
due to the Fe carbide species already present after reduction caused
an increase in mass. Thus, the net effect was a lower mass change
rate than when the catalyst reached a state where no further reduction
took place. Subsequently, the coking rate decreased over 4 h. It is
believed that the measured mass change was caused directly by carbon
build-up and not hydrocarbons because of the reaction conditions used.36 Carbon laydown rate decreased with increasing
particle size initially (1st hour), but the rate increased with increasing
initial particle size at steady state (4th hour). This indicates that
the effect of particle size on carbon deposition rate was different
when the surfaces were relatively clean and after reaction had proceeded
for a longer period. Possible reasons for this decrease in coking
rate include blocking of active sites (surface covered with amorphous
or graphitic carbon), growth of Fe carbide particles, and phase transformations
that do not convert CO to carbon. Thus, it appeared that the carbon
deposition was most severe in the initial period and was not the main
reason for deactivation over a longer period (10–100 h TOS).

The spent catalysts after carbon deposition studies (TOS = 4 h)
and after catalytic tests (TOS = 100 h) were characterized with TEM,
and images are shown in Figure S2 and Figure 3 respectively. It was mentioned earlier that the addition of promoters
did not lead to a significant change in Fe particle size distribution
of the fresh catalysts. However, the Fe particle size distributions
of spent promoted and unpromoted catalysts were strikingly different.
The promoted catalysts displayed a higher degree of sintering compared
to the unpromoted catalysts. In the extreme case (9FeP) depicted in Figure 3h, Fe particles of
approximately 100 nm were observed. In addition, the promoted Fe nanoparticles
seemed to have a core–shell structure (Figure 3e–h). TEM-EDX maps (Figure 3i–m) showed that the
core was rich in Fe and the shell was mainly Fe oxide. The formation
of Fe oxide was most likely due to exposure to air after reaction.

Figure 3 TEM images
of spent (a–d) unpromoted catalysts and (e–h)
promoted catalysts after carbon deposition studies (340 °C, 20
bar, H2/CO = 1, GHSV = 54 000 h–1, TOS
= 100 h). TEM-EDX maps of spent 7FeP catalyst (i–m).

In Figure 4, the
average iron particle sizes of fresh and spent catalysts are compared.
The particle size distributions of spent catalysts can be found in SI 1. It was thus shown that the promoted Fe
nanoparticles produced more carbon and displayed more sintering while
the unpromoted catalysts showed limited sintering even after 100 h
TOS.

catalysts and (red ■) unpromoted catalysts after catalytic
tests, TOS = 100 h (340 °C, 20 bar, H2/CO = 1, GHSV

Figure 5 reveals
the effects of the particle size on the stability of unpromoted Fe
FT catalysts. The unpromoted catalysts showed increased catalytic
activity and limited sintering over time, and it is proposed tentatively
that the increased catalytic activity is related to increased Fe carbidization.

h–1). Lines were added to guide the eye.

Figure 6 depicts
the effects of the particle size on the stability of promoted Fe FT
catalysts. The decrease in catalytic activity appeared to be in agreement
with the increase in Fe particle size over time. The loss of surface
area per gram Fe follows the relation: surface area/volume α
1/Fe particle diameter; thus, FTY was fitted to be inversely proportional
to particle size (trend line in Figure 6). The first data point (smallest average particle
size) appeared to be an anomaly, and that is attributed to the presence
of small particles around 3 and 4 nm. These small Fe particles were
shown previously to be highly active and produced mainly methane.16

°C, 20 bar, H2/CO = 1, GHSV = 54 000 h–1). The trend line is fitted to y α x–1 for all data points except the first
point.

For the promoted catalysts, Fe
particle growth was concluded to
be the main cause of deactivation. Phase transformations, which occurred
when water was produced but not removed from the catalyst bed, were
reported previously to be a reason for deactivation;25−27 however, it is not expected to be relevant here because of the use
of high space velocities and low conversion conditions. Carbon deposition
rates decreased over the initial hours and were not expected to play
a significant role over a longer period. The use of sulfur, in the
absence of sodium, to increase the resistance against carbon deposition
was demonstrated earlier,29 and this may
be a possibility to explain the relatively low carbon deposition rates
when compared to other Fe-based catalysts. The sintering of Fe nanoparticles
supported on O-functionalized CNTs was concluded previously to be
more severe due to weak support–metal interactions and a low
concentration of surface defects for anchoring of Fe nanoparticles.33 Although a weakly interacting support CNF was
used in this study, very different extent of particle growth was observed
for the promoted and unpromoted Fe nanoparticles. This proves that
the severe sintering of promoted Fe nanoparticles was not solely due
to weak metal–support interaction. Intrinsically, the FTO process
would be a high temperature FT route, thus sintering is expected to
be more prominent than at the less severe conditions of low-temperature
FT, which is typical for coal-to-liquids (CTL).

Conclusion
The
activity, product selectivity and stability of CNF-supported
Fe catalysts under industrially relevant Fischer–Tropsch to
olefins (FTO) conditions were investigated. It was observed that the
activity of unpromoted catalysts increased over time, regardless of
particle size. With addition of promoters, maximum activity was attained
in the initial period and deactivation was prominent.

In situ
Mössbauer spectroscopy revealed that both promoted
and unpromoted catalysts attained similar Fe carbidization levels
after reduction. However, after 20 h of synthesis gas treatment, the
promoted catalyst was fully carbided, and the carbidization level
of the unpromoted catalyst did not increase beyond 25%. This difference
in phase transformation upon exposure to synthesis gas resulted in
a higher initial activity of the promoted catalyst. As the correlation
of activity and Fe carbide species was not linear, deactivation via
carbon deposition and/or Fe particle growth is proposed to occur simultaneously
with phase transformations.

A tapered element oscillating microbalance
(TEOM) was utilized
to measure the rate of carbon deposition under industrially relevant
FTO conditions. No carbon laydown was detected for the unpromoted
catalysts, and this was rationalized by the lack of active Fe carbide
phases. In contrast, the presence of promoters facilitated Fe activation
which resulted in significant carbon deposition over the first hours
of operation. While different particle sizes resulted in different
coking rates, coking rates decreased over time. This suggests that
carbon deposition is not the leading cause of deactivation over longer
periods.

Limited sintering was observed for the unpromoted catalysts
while
severe sintering was seen for the promoted catalysts. This indicated
that the promoters led to formation of mobile and active Fe phases
which resulted in a higher degree of particle growth.

For the
unpromoted catalysts, phase transformation was considered
to be the leading cause for the increase in catalytic activity over
time. For the promoted catalysts, catalytic activity was shown to
be inversely proportional to Fe particle diameter of spent catalysts
which leads to the conclusion that here Fe particle growth is the
main reason for deactivation over time.

under industrially relevant FTO conditions were thoroughly and critically
assessed. Although the activity and C2–C4 olefins selectivity of the promoted Fe catalysts were highly encouraging,
the stability needs improvement. Carbon deposition for Fe nanoparticles
was less significant compared to bulk Fe catalysts and is proposed
not to play a pivotal role in the deactivation. Sintering was, however,
the major cause of deactivation, and it is hence believed that sintering
is a vital factor affecting stability of these highly active and selective
promoted Fe catalysts. Thus, the direction of future research is on
designing highly active and selective Fe catalysts which are more
resistant to sintering. It is of interest for future studies to unravel
the mechanism and details of particle growth of promoted and unpromoted
Fe nanoparticles.
