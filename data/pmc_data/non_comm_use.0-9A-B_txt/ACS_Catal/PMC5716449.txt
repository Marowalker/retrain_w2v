Enzymes exist as
ensembles of conformations that are important
for function. Tuning these populations of conformational states through
mutation enables evolution toward additional activities. Here we computationally
evaluate the population shifts induced by distal and active site mutations
in a family of computationally designed and experimentally optimized
retro-aldolases. The conformational landscape of these enzymes was
significantly altered during evolution, as pre-existing catalytically
active conformational substates became major states in the most evolved
variants. We further demonstrate that key residues responsible for
these substate conversions can be predicted computationally. Significantly,
the identified residues coincide with those positions mutated in the
laboratory evolution experiments. This study establishes that distal
mutations that affect enzyme catalytic activity can be predicted computationally
and thus provides the enzyme (re)design field with a rational strategy
to determine promising sites for enhancing activity through mutation.

Introduction
The most proficient
catalysts known on Earth are enzymes, which
accelerate diverse chemical reactions by many orders of magnitude.
Their extraordinary catalytic power is mainly attributed to highly
preorganized active sites, which properly position the catalytic machinery
for efficient transition state (TS) stabilization.1−5 The existence of a link between active site dynamics
and the chemical step has been recently investigated and debated;1,6−9 however, this is totally independent of the fact that enzymes are
inherently dynamic entities that sample a vast ensemble of conformational
states important for their function.10,11 The ability
of enzymes to fluctuate between different well-defined thermally accessible
conformations is important for substrate binding, regulation, inhibition,
and product release.

Enzymes exist as an ensemble of conformational
substates, whose
populations can be shifted by substrate binding and also by introducing
mutations during evolution toward novel function. The concept of population
shifts or redistributions of protein conformational states underlies
efforts to rationalize substrate binding mechanisms and allosteric
regulation.10,12 The alteration of enzyme function
by introducing mutations to its sequence13 can be compared with the phenomenon of allosteric regulation, as
mutations may directly affect the populations of individual conformational
substates of the enzyme,14−16 which in turn influences catalytic
activity. Notably, such mutations are often distant from the active
site.17−19 Several studies have examined the conformational
dynamics of some specialized enzymes16,20 and the role
of population shifts induced by mutations in enzyme evolution.21,22 The ability of some enzymes to catalyze promiscuous reactions has
been associated with their conformational plasticity and changes in
the conformational landscape.23 In a recent
study, Campbell and co-workers demonstrated for a model system that
a change in function can be achieved through population of pre-existing
conformational substates.14 Static X-ray
structures of several intermediate variants for evolving a phosphotriesterase
into an arylesterase were analyzed.

Many computational strategies
are available to study protein dynamics.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a widely accepted tool for evaluating
the enzyme conformational dynamics in atomistic detail,24,25 is particularly useful in this regard. Long-time-scale MD, for example,
has been used to explore the role of allosteric regulation and distal
active site mutations on the conformational dynamics of an acyltransferase
(LovD) enzyme.18,26 MD, in contrast to X-ray crystallography,
was able to elucidate the reasons for catalytic activity differences
observed in LovD variants. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments
have also provided key information about conformational ensembles
of enzymes and changes in amino acid networks in the different substates.27,28 All of these studies based on different techniques support the idea
that enzymes can have low populations of many different conformational
states, which can be gradually tuned to become major states to allow
novel function.

Retro-aldolases (RA) that cleave the methodol
substrate (see Figure 1a) are, from a mechanistic
perspective, the most complex computationally designed enzymes to
date.13,29,30 They follow
a multistep pathway involving enzyme-bound Schiff base intermediates
that convert substrate into product. Analysis of initial computational
designs generated with Rosetta31 revealed
that the most active enzymes only offer a 105-fold kcat/kuncat improvement
due to the lack of precision and specificity in their interactions
with the substrate.32,33 Further laboratory-directed evolution
(DE) engineering of the computationally designed RA95 boosted its
specific activity by more than 4400-fold.34 The kinetic characterization of the variants indicated that the
increase in catalytic efficiency was mainly due to an improvement
in kcat, which was principally achieved
via mutations located all around the enzyme structure (see Figure 1b,c). These distal
active site mutations caused pronounced molecular changes. Surprisingly,
the computationally designed catalytic lysine was unexpectedly abandoned
in favor of a new lysine residue in the opposite site of the binding
pocket created during the DE evolution.34 The variant RA95.5-8 presents a higher activity than RA95.0, RA95.5,
and RA95.5-5 (Figure 1b). It is also a promiscuous variant catalyzing asymmetric Michael
additions of carbanions to unsaturated ketones,35 Knoevenagel condensations of electron-rich aldehydes and
activated methylene donors,36 and the synthesis
of γ-nitroketones.37 Very recently,
Hilvert and co-workers using a new ultrahigh-throughput droplet-based
microfluidic screening platform evolved RA95.5-8 into the highly active
artificial aldolase RA95.5-8F, whose activity rivals the efficiency
of natural class I aldolases.19 This new
variant features a catalytic tetrad that emerged along the DE pathway,
highlighting that sophisticated active sites can be created even in
laboratory-evolved enzymes.

catalytic efficiencies of the enzymes (kcat/KM in M–1 s–1) are

with Rosetta are shown.

In this study, we demonstrate that the mutation points introduced
for achieving the highly active artificial aldolase RA95.5-8F could
have been predicted a priori from long-time-scale MD simulations coupled
to residue-by-residue correlation measures. Our study starts with
the evaluation of the active site conformational dynamics of the different
retro-aldolase variants obtained during laboratory-based evolution,
followed by a detailed analysis of the population shift induced by
mutations. Finally, we demonstrate that MD simulations coupled to
residue-by-residue correlation can identify the residues involved
in the population shift toward the catalytically active states. Interestingly,
the residues identified with MD and the positions mutated along the
evolutionary process for achieving a highly proficient retro-aldolase
coincide. This study thus provides a rational strategy to determine
promising sites for enhancing novel activity by mutation.

Results
Evolution of
Active Site Conformational Dynamics
Our
analysis starts with the exploration of the RA95 active site conformational
dynamics to evaluate the molecular changes induced by the distal active
site mutations (the mean distance between the catalytic lysine and
the introduced mutations from RA95.5 to RA95.5-8F is ca. 15 Å;
see Figure 1c).19,34 We analyze both the apo and Schiff base intermediate
states (see Figure 1a). In Figure 2, an
overlay of the different structures visited along the long-time-scale
MD simulations is provided together with key catalytic distances.
The available X-ray structures of the RA95 variants with a diketone
inhibitor bound are also shown.

Catalytic residues are represented by blue sticks (for visualization
purposes Asn110 has not been included). X-ray structures with the
diketone inhibitor bound are displayed for: RA95.0 (PDB 4A29, in purple), RA95.5
(PDB 4A2S, in
two types of green, lime green for the inhibitor bound to position
83 and light green for position 210), RA95.5-5 (PDB 4A2R, orange), RA95.5-8F
(PDB 5AN7, in
yellow).

The computational design RA95.0,
created from a (βα)8 barrel scaffold (16 mutations
on PDB, 1LBL; see Table S1 in the Supporting Information),
contains
Glu53 that was assumed to activate a water molecule to promote the
C–C bond cleavage at the Schiff base intermediate. Our simulations
indicate that ca. 11 water molecules are present around the catalytic
Lys210 in the apo state (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). We observe a rather long
distance between Glu53 and the catalytic Lys210 (ca. 7.1 ± 2.8
Å at the Schiff base intermediate; see Figure 2 and Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), suggesting a minor role of Glu53
in positioning a preorganized water molecule ready for catalysis.
Indeed, our observations are in line with the reported low activity
of the computational RA95.0 variant and the fact that full activity
is retained after mutating Glu53 to alanine.

The initial RA95.0
computational design was further evolved through
DE to RA95.5, where six mutations were introduced (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).34 Interestingly, a second lysine appeared at position 83,
which in the case of the most evolved RA variants was found to be
more effective than Lys210 as a catalytic group under normal turnover
conditions.34 Glu53 was replaced by serine
(E53S), and a new tyrosine residue at position 51 was installed (V51Y)
for promoting the β-alcohol deprotonation (see Figure 1c). In our MD simulations of
the Schiff base intermediate, we observe two clear conformations of
the L6 loop (residues 180–190), which induce two different
orientations of the intermediate (see Figure 2b and Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The positions of these conformations
coincide with the two possible binding modes of the inhibitor (one
bound to position 83 and another to position 210) observed in the
RA95.5 crystallographic structure. This high flexibility of the Schiff
base intermediate leads to a poorly preorganized active site, with
a catalytic distance of ca. 5.0 ± 1.4 Å between the base
and the β-alcohol (the distance is ca. 4.9 ± 1.2 Å
in the apo state; see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The mean hydrogen bond angle
is ca. 74 ± 52° (Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information); therefore, an ideal hydrogen bond conformation
is hardly sampled during the MD runs. The active site of the enzyme
is solvent exposed with ca. 10 water molecules around Lys83 (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information), indicating
that water could also play a crucial role in assisting the reaction.

RA95.5-5, generated by additional rounds of mutagenesis and plate
screening, has six additional mutations, three of them at the enzyme
active site (E53T, S110N, and G178S), and the rest on the protein
surface (R23H, R43S, and T95M, see Table S1 in the Supporting Information). The X-ray of this variant in the
presence of a diketone inhibitor confirmed that it is exclusively
bound at Lys83 (see Figure 2c, X-ray in orange). Our MD simulations revealed that the
Schiff base intermediate is still not well positioned for catalysis,
as the distance between the base and the β-alcohol is ca. 5.4
± 1.1 Å and the angle is ca. 73 ± 30° (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). A further
evolved variant, RA95.5-8, contains five additional mutations: three
near the active site (S178 V, K135N, and G212D), and two distal (S43R,
F72Y, see Table S1). This new variant is
ca. 60-fold more active than RA95.5, which is mainly due to an increase
in kcat rather than KM. The MD simulations performed indicate that the distance
between Lys83 and Tyr51 is ca. 4.6 ± 0.8 Å in the apo state (Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information) but ca. 5.5 ± 1.6 Å for the Schiff base intermediate.
The hydrogen bond angles for deprotonating the β-alcohol are
quite broad, but the average angle (ca. 98 ± 36°) is larger
than in the other variants, consistent with the higher catalytic efficiency
observed for this enzyme (see Figure S4). As observed in Figure 2d, the Schiff base intermediate is still quite flexible and
can occupy two different pockets. It can be oriented in a conformation
similar to that observed for RA95.5-5, as well as in the catalytically
productive binding pose observed for the highly evolved RA95.5-8F
(see below). The latter state is, however, hardly visited along the
MD simulation of this variant.

We finally evaluated the highly
evolved RA95.5-8F variant, which
provides a >109 rate enhancement. This enzyme exhibits
a kcat value of 10.8 s–1 and a kcat/KM value of 34000 M–1 s–1, values
comparable to those of natural class I aldolases.19 RA95.5-8F contains 13 additional mutations scattered throughout
the whole protein (see Figure 1b,c). This enzyme possesses a catalytic tetrad composed by
the RA95.5-8 triad Lys83, Tyr51, and Asn110, with an additional Tyr180
(due to the F180Y mutation). Of particular note, the original catalytic
Lys210 is mutated to leucine. Our MD simulations, like the X-ray structure,
show that the catalytic tetrad is perfectly arranged to bind the substrate
and adapt to geometric and electrostatic changes occurring during
the mechanistically complex reaction pathway. In the apo state, the distance between Tyr51 and Lys83 is ca. 4.6 ± 0.9
Å but ca. 7.2 ± 1.4 Å between Tyr180 and Lys83 (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). For
the Schiff base intermediate, we investigated the possibility of either
Tyr51 or Tyr180 acting as the base for deprotonating the β-alcohol
(compare Figure 2e,f).
Our results indicate that Tyr180 is substantially better positioned
for deprotonating the alcohol, as it stays at ca. 3.1 ± 0.8 Å
(ca. 5.9 ± 1.2 Å for Tyr51) with an angle close to the ideal
180° (ca. 143 ± 38°, see Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). This stable and catalytically
competent conformation of the Schiff base intermediate is mainly due
to the formation of a hydrogen bond between the oxygen atom of the
β-alcohol and Tyr51. In fact, when the Y180F mutation is introduced
in RA95.5-8F, slightly longer distances are observed (ca. 3.6 ±
1.3 Å between Tyr51 and the alcohol). However, a more drastic
effect is observed in the Y51F variant (ca. 4.6 ± 2.1 Å
for Tyr180-OSchiff). In Y51F, the key hydrogen bond with
Tyr51 for maintaining the catalytically competent conformation of
the Schiff base intermediate is lost (see Figure S15 in the Supporting Information). This is in line with the
4- and 90-fold decreases in kcat observed
experimentally for Y180F and Y51F, respectively.19 The importance of both Tyr51 and Tyr180 for catalysis was
also found experimentally, as replacing both residues resulted in
a 17000-fold decrease in kcat.19 The overlay of some representative MD snapshots
with the X-ray structure reveal a highly preorganized active site,
with the Schiff base intermediate properly positioned for catalysis
most of the simulation time because of the enhanced hydrogen bond
network due to the presence of Tyr180. These results are in line with
the recent finding by the Hilvert laboratory that the rate-limiting
step of the process in the most evolved RA95.5-8 and RA95.5-8F variants
is not the C–C bond scission (as in RA95.0), but rather the
product release step.38

The Schiff
base conformation adopted in RA95.5-8F matches that
observed in the X-ray structure, but interestingly, the binding pose
is well matched with that of the computational design RA95.0 (check
purple and yellow structures in Figure 2e). The decrease in the pKa of the catalytic lysine observed experimentally19,34 is in line with the decrease in the water solvation shell of Lys83
(from 11 to 6), which favors its deprotonated form, and thus facilitates
Schiff base formation (see Figure S3 and Table S2 in the Supporting Information).

Evolution of Conformational
Dynamics for Enhancing Retro-Aldolase
Activity
The evaluation of the enzyme active site conformational
dynamics has revealed that distal mutations progressively stabilized
the catalytically competent arrangement for catalysis. This is especially
true for the highly evolved RA95.5-8F enzyme, which features a catalytic
tetrad that stays in the catalytically competent arrangement for the
entire simulation. The analysis of the structural differences observed
along the MD simulations using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
indicates that a population shift occurred along the evolutionary
pathway (see Figure 3 and Figure S9 and movies in the Supporting Information). The first principal
component (PC1) is able to distinguish inactive states (those presenting
a long distance between the base and the β-alcohol, in red in Figure 3b) from the catalytically
competent states (active, marked in green in Figure 3b). The main difference between both states
arises from the different binding modes of the Schiff base intermediate
in the enzyme active site and conformational changes in the flexible
loops L1 (residues 52–66), L2 (82–89), L6 (180–190),
and L7 (211–215) (see movies in
the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Representation of the MD trajectories projected
into the two most
important principal components (PC1, PC2) based on Cα contacts for (a) RA95.0, (b) RA95.5, (c) RA95.5-5, (d) RA95.5-8,
and (e) RA95.5-8F Schiff base intermediates. For each substate, the
mean distance between the heteroatom of the base and the oxygen of
the Schiff base β-alcohol is represented together with the standard
deviation (in Å). Those states exploring distances in the 2.0–4.0
Å range are shown in green: i.e., they are catalytically competent,
and other states are shown in red. PC1 (x axis) differentiates
inactive states (low PC1 values, pink structure in (b)) that present
long catalytic distances from those properly oriented for the catalysis
(high PC1 values, green structure in (b)). An overlay of the interpolated
structures along PC1 and PC2 is also displayed for RA95.5.

The least proficient enzymes (RA95.0) explore conformational
substates
that barely sample catalytically proficient distances (marked in pink
in Figure 3). This
is observed for all variants from RA95.0 to RA95.5-8. DE mutations
progressively stabilize catalytically competent substates (see conformational
states marked in green in Figure 3). The major conformational states in RA95.5-8F have
the catalytic Tyr180 properly positioned to deprotonate the alcohol
of the Schiff base intermediate. What is more important is that all
conformational states are catalytically productive. Our microsecond
time scale MD simulations have thus been able to capture significant
differences in the conformational substates sampled by the evolved
DE variants. Nevertheless, we are aware that much longer or multiple
short MD simulations will be needed to capture both kinetics and thermodynamic
aspects of this system.39

RA95.0
is substantially more flexible than the rest of the variants
(see Figure S7 in the Supporting Information),
and a gradual reduction in the conformational flexibility of loops
L1 (residues 52–66) and L6 (residues 180–190) is observed,
RA95.5-8F being substantially less flexible than the other variants.
DE mutations decreased enzyme flexibility and thus increased its thermostability,
as observed experimentally.19

Identification
of Residue Pathways for Novel Function
Our microsecond time
scale MD simulations have provided a rationalization
of the differences in the catalytic efficiencies of the designed and
evolved DE variants. They have also demonstrated that the conformational
landscape along the evolutionary pathway is significantly altered,
with the catalytically active conformational substates progressively
populated to an increasing extent. This study, together with work
on other enzymes,18,25,26,40 demonstrates the power of MD for rationalizing
DE evolutionary pathways. However, the main question is whether MD
can be used as a predictive tool to determine, a priori, which changes
might enable novel function. By analogy to DE, the latter changes
could be located either close to the enzyme reaction center or at
distal positions. Although some studies have used MD to propose mutations
in the past,13,39,41 the predictions were always restricted to the active site.

As shown in the previous sections, RA enzymes sample different conformational
states that are not equally populated and these populations shift
upon introduction of mutations. The population shift concept has been
used previously to rationalize substrate binding mechanisms and allosteric
regulation.10,42 From a computational perspective,
allosteric processes have been evaluated via MD to generate molecular
ensembles coupled with community network analysis, which identifies
clusters of highly connected residues based on residue-by-residue
correlation and proximity.42,43 Given the high similarity
of both processes, we hypothesized that correlation-based measures
might be useful in the enzyme design field as well.

We developed
a new tool, DynaComm.py, that explores
residue-by-residue correlated movements and inter-residue distances
as in previous allosteric studies42,44 (see Computational Details for more details). This generates
a complex graph based on proximity and correlation. We further evaluated
the latter graph by making use of the Dijkstra algorithm as implemented
in the igraph module45 to identify the
shortest path lengths. This generates a map that we call the shortest
path map (SPM), which identifies pairs of residues that have a higher
contribution to the communication pathway. We applied this tool to
the accumulated 3 μs MD simulations performed for the studied
enzyme variants and compared the SPMs obtained with the DE mutation
sites (see Figures 1b, 4, and 5 and Figure S8 and S12–S14 in the Supporting
Information). When the structures in Figure 4b–e were compared, it was found that
the residues identified by SPM and the positions mutated experimentally
during DE are strikingly similar. What is more important is that the
SPM can be constructed along the DE process to track which positions
could be mutated for pursuing novel RA activity (see Figures 4, and 5). In RA95.0, five out of six DE mutations are included in the SPM
(marked in purple in Figure 4); the missing site is located at an adjacent position (D183
in orange; see Figure 4b). The same happens in RA95.5, where the exact mutation sites or
adjacent positions are predicted by SPM (only T95 is displaced five
positions from SPM). The same holds for RA95.5-5 (four out of five
predicted, one out of five in an adjacent position, see S43 in Figure 4d). The most evolved
RA95.5-8F variant, which contains a highly preorganized catalytic
tetrad, was generated from the previous RA95.5-8 enzyme. Interestingly,
the SPM of RA95.5-8 highlights that the catalytic Lys83, Try51, and
Asn110 are all contained in the SPM, and more importantly Phe180,
which was subsequently mutated to Tyr180 to complete the catalytic
tetrad, is also included in the path. This evidences the correlated
movement of these positions. In RA95.5-8, seven mutations are predicted,
four are in adjacent positions, and only two are displaced six positions
from SPM (see S151 and N90 in Figure 4e).

The size of the sphere is indicative of the importance of the position,
and black edges represent the communication path: i.e., how the different
residues are connected. Those points mutated via DE are marked in
purple (if they are included in the SPM), in orange if they are located
in adjacent positions of the SPM (in parentheses is shown how far
in the sequence from the closest residue included in SPM), and in
green if the mutation is located at more than five positions away
in sequence from the SPM. In 1LBL (a), the positions have been colored
according to their evolutionary conservation using Evolutionary Trace
Server (most conserved in red; less conserved in gray).46 (f) Analysis of the H-bond network in RA95.5-8.
Those hydrogen bonds that have been maintained at least half of the
simulation time are represented by sticks: in blue those hydrogen
bonds that occur between backbone atoms, in pink those contacts between
backbone and side-chain positions, and finally in yellow hydrogen
bonds between side chains. The weight of the hydrogen bond (HB) stick
indicates how frequently the HB is observed.

dots in purple (if they are included in the SPM), orange (if displaced

(residues 52–66), L2 (residues 82–89), L6 (residues
180–190), and L7 (residues 211–215) are marked. The
catalytic residues, also included in the SPM, are marked with blue
dots. (b) Shortest path map computed for RA95.5-8 projected over the
interpolated structures along PC1. Loops L1, L2, L6, and L7 are colored
in light green, yellow, blue, and cyan, respectively.

The analysis of the most conserved hydrogen bonds
(HB) along the
MD trajectories indicates that some of the residues included in the
SPM also participate in the protein HB network (see Figure 4 and Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). We also find that there
is not a direct correlation between the residues included in the path
and the most flexible parts of the protein (see Figure 5 and Figure S8 in the Supporting Information). However, most of the residues included
in SPM are located adjacent to flexible regions of the enzyme (see Figure 5 and Figure S12). Interestingly, a detailed analysis
of the evolutionary conservation of the positions included in the
SPM on the original scaffold 1LBL (see Figure 4a) reveals that many of them are quite conserved.46 SPM thus successfully identifies the residues
involved in the conversion between the sampled conformational states,
which seem to be the target points for DE for enhancing the novel
function.

Discussion
Enzymes display a variety
of conformational substates that can
be converted into major catalytically competitive states by introducing
both active sites and distal mutations. The existence of such accessible
conformational substates implies that catalytic promiscuity is an
inherent characteristic of some enzymes, which might be exploited
to enable the emergence of novel functions as has been done in some
examples.14,15,35,36,47 Long-time-scale molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations can assess these enzyme conformational landscapes
and thus identify conformational substates, whose populations can
be shifted to enhance new catalytic activities. The main question
that remains to be answered is how one can identify which mutations
are required to favor the desired population shift. Directed evolution
(DE) has shown us that these amino acid changes occur not only at
the enzyme active site but also at distal positions. So far, the computational
prediction of these mutation points has been extremely challenging,
especially for distal residues that are usually key for activity.17,18

Our study provides evidence that MD, coupled to correlation-based
tools similar to those used to investigate processes such as allosteric
regulation and molecular recognition, can be successfully applied
in the enzyme (re)design field. We have developed the shortest path
map (SPM), which analyzes the different conformational substates sampled
along the MD trajectory and identifies which residues are important
for the substate interconversion. Therefore, if catalytically competent
states are sampled in the MD simulation, the new tool facilitates
identification of residues that contribute to the inactive-to-active
interconversion. SPM thus identifies not only active sites but also
distal residues that could lead to a population shift toward the catalytically
competent conformation for novel activity. This is totally unprecedented
and thus opens the door to new computational paradigms that are not
restricted to active site alterations. We are currently developing
additional strategies based on the analysis of possible hydrogen bond
and noncovalent interactions of the identified SPM position and surrounding
residues to propose specific amino acid changes for novel function.

Interestingly, application of the SPM tool to the original scaffold
1LBL that was used to generate the RA95.0 computational design already
identifies the key mutation sites that were ultimately modified via
DE (see Figure 4a and Figure S14 in the Supporting Information). This
indicates that the residues identified with SPM presenting a higher
contribution (i.e., larger spheres in the graph) could be used for
the design of smart libraries for experimental evolution. Thus, this
study suggests that the highly active RA95.5-8F retro-aldolase variant
could have been generated much more efficiently had the SPM tool been
applied at the start of the process.

The success of SPM in this
particular enzyme could be related to
the fact that the original scaffold (1LBL) is an indole-3-glycerol
phosphate synthase.48 This enzyme has 30%
sequence identity to imidazole-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS),
which is a known allosterically regulated enzyme.44,49 Nussinov and co-workers argued that allostery is an intrinsic property
of all dynamic (nonfibrous) proteins, which suggests that the SPM
tool might be applied to other cases as well.12 The recent study of Hilvert and co-workers on these RA enzymes has
indicated that, especially in the most evolved variants, product release
is rate-limiting.50 Although we have restricted
our study to the retro-aldolase evolution case, our laboratory is
investigating the applicability of this tool to other unrelated systems
that are also limited by product release. Another important observation
is that both 1LBL and IGPS are (βα)8 barrel
enzymes, which is the most common enzyme fold in the Protein Data
Bank.51 In addition, many of the residues
included in SPM are quite conserved, especially those located at the
end of the β-sheets. This is of importance, as the catalytic
groups in (βα)8 barrel enzymes are usually
located at the ends of these different β-strands.52

Conclusions
This work demonstrates
that more active enzymes could be designed
computationally if the conformational dynamics of the enzyme were
exploited. Most of the currently available computational strategies
are highly focused on optimizing the chemistry and overlook other
equally essential steps such as substrate binding, product release,
and associated conformational changes often required for catalysis.
Future computational enzyme design strategies will need to extensively
evaluate the enzyme conformational dynamics if more proficient enzyme
variants are to be pursued.

Computational Details
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
MD simulations in explicit
water were performed using the AMBER 16 package.53 The Amber 99SB force field (ff99SB) was used, and parameters
for the Schiff base intermediates were generated using the general
AMBER force field (gaff),54 with partial charges set to fit the electrostatic potential generated
at the HF/6-31G(d) level by the restrained electrostatic potential
(RESP) model.55 Amino acid protonation
states were predicted using the H++ server (http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++). Water molecules were treated using the SHAKE algorithm, and long-range
electrostatic effects were considered using the particle mesh Ewald
method.56 The Langevin equilibration scheme
was used to control and equalize the temperature with a 2 fs time
step at a constant pressure of 1 atm and temperature of 300 K, and
an 8 Å cutoff was applied to Lennard–Jones and electrostatic
interactions. Production trajectories were run for 1000 ns and were
analyzed using the cpptraj module included in the
AMBER 16 package. PCA analysis was done with the pyEMMA software.57

Shortest Path Map Analysis
The first step of the shortest
path map (SPM) calculation relies on the construction of a graph based
on the computed mean distances and correlation values, in a fashion
similar to that in previous studies (see the Supporting Information for further details).42,44 The graph is then further simplified by making use of the Dijkstra
algorithm as implemented in the igraph module45 to identify the shortest path lengths. The algorithm goes through
all nodes of the graph and identifies which is the shortest length
path to go from the first until the last protein residue. The method
therefore identifies which edges of the graph are shorter, i.e. more
correlated, and that are more central for the communication pathway.
Only those edges having a higher contribution are represented, and
they are weighted according to their contribution (see the Supporting Information for more details).

All of these algorithms have been implemented in the new developed DynaComm.py python code, and all structure figures were
illustrated using PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org). A web-based server of DynaComm.py will be available
on our group webpage (http://silviaosuna.wordpress.com/tools).
