TiO2 has long been recognized as a stable and reusable
photocatalyst for water splitting and pollution control. However,
it is an inefficient anode material in the absence of photoactivation
due to its low electron conductivity. To overcome this limitation,
a series of conductive TiO2 nanotube array electrodes have
been developed. Even though nanotube arrays are effective for electrochemical
oxidation initially, deactivation is often observed within a few hours.
To overcome the problem of deactivation, we have synthesized cobalt-doped
Black-TiO2 nanotube array (Co-Black NTA) electrodes that
are stable for more than 200 h of continuous operation in a NaClO4 electrolyte at 10 mA cm–2. Using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, electron
paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and DFT simulations, we are able
to show that bulk oxygen vacancies (Ov) are the primary
source of the enhanced conductivity of Co-Black. Cobalt doping both
creates and stabilizes surficial oxygen vacancies, Ov,
and thus prevents surface passivation. The Co-Black electrodes outperform
dimensionally stable IrO2 anodes (DSA) in the electrolytic
oxidation of organic-rich wastewater. Increasing the loading of Co
leads to the formation of a CoOx film
on top of Co-Black electrode. The CoOx/Co-Black composite electrode was found to have a lower OER overpotential
(352 mV) in comparison to a DSA IrO2 (434 mV) electrode
and a stability that is greater than 200 h in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte
at a current density of 10 mA cm–2.

Introduction
TiO2 has long been recognized
as a stable and reusable
photocatalyst for water splitting and pollution.1 However, potential applications of TiO2 are
most often correlated with its oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential.1,2 In spite of success in laboratory-scale research, many challenges
remain with respect to the use of TiO2 in solar fuel production
and environmental remediation due to (1) its high band-gap energy
of 3.2 eV (i.e., 385 nm) and (2) high attenuation coefficients for
the penetration of incident UV photons in turbid water (i.e., both
freshwater and wastewater). Some of these intrinsic barriers can be
overcome when TiO2 is used in electrochemical systems applications
without the need for direct photoactivation of TiO2.3,4 However, the low mobile carrier conductivity of n-type TiO2 impedes its use as an electrocatalyst. The transport of electrons
across the electrolyte/TiO2 interface requires a large
anodic potential (>3 VAg/AgCl) to overcome a high Schottky
barrier.4

The electronic properties
of TiO2 can be tuned by self-doping.
It is known that H2 reduction could introduce Ti3+, oxygen vacancies, and surface disorders to TiO2. The
resultant Black TiO2 has a narrower band gap.5−7 Black TiO2 catalysts on both anatase and rutile structures
exhibited high activity in visible-light-driven water oxidation.8,9 However, their activity during dark electrolysis has been less explored.
Reducing TiO2 in pure H2 at temperatures over
1000 °C promotes the bulk phase transition from anatase to substoichiometric
Magnéli phase Ti4O7.10 Magnéli phase TiO2 has conductivities
that approach 11 orders of magnitude greater than that of TiO2.11 Thus, it has been shown to
be a stable anode material for water oxidation and wastewater treatment.12,13

Given that the preparation of Ti4O7 requires
highly reducing conditions, it is often difficult to prepare conductive,
stoichiometric TiO2 using conventional techniques. Recently,
conductive TiO2 nanotube arrays (NTAs) that are either
blue or black in appearance have been reported. Black NTAs were prepared
by reducing anatase NTA under an H2 or H2/Ar
atmosphere at 450–550 °C.14,15 Blue NTAs
were obtained by cathodization of anatase NTA in aqueous electrolyte.16−20 Conductive NTA electrodes have satisfactory electrochemical oxidation
activity.20,21 The synthetic preparation procedures for
Blue and Black NTA are less stringent than those of the Magnéli
phases, TixO2x–1.

Conductive NTAs supported on titanium plates have a major
advantage
over particulate electrocatalysts, since they can be utilized directly
as electrodes without the need for additional adhesive substrates
or organic binders. However, deactivation of both Blue and Black NTAs
has been observed after a few hours of electrocatalysis due to the
surface passivation.20,21 Therefore, electrodes made from
these materials are currently impractical for engineering applications.

In this study, we report on the effect of doping trace amounts
of cobalt onto Black TiO2 NTA (Co-Black NTA) that results
in a lowering of the OER overpotential and increases electrode stability.
Even though bulk CoOx is reported to be
unstable for the OER at pH <12 in phosphate-free electrolyte solutions,22,23 we observe that CoOx is immobilized
and stable on Black NTAs even at circumneutral pH. We show that Co-Black
electrodes outperform an IrO2-based dimensionally stable
anode (DSA) for oxidative electrochemical wastewater treatment. We
also found that the increase of Co loading forms a CoOx film on top of Co-Black substrate. The resultant
CoOx/Co-Black composite electrode exhibits
high OER activity (overpotential of 352 mV vs 434 mV for IrO2 DSA) and stability (>200 h) in 1 M KOH electrolyte at 10 mA cm–2.

Experimental Section
Electrode Preparation
The overall approach to synthesize
NTA electrodes is schematically illustrated in Figure 1a. Amorphous TiO2 NTA (Am-NTA)
was prepared by anodization of a Ti plate (6 cm2, 0.5 mm)
at 42 V in ethylene glycol (EG) electrolyte with 0.25 wt % NH4F and 2 wt % H2O for 6 h.24 After anodization, Am-NTA was subjected to a second anodization
in 5 wt % H3PO4/EG electrolyte at 42 V for 1
h to enhance its mechanical stability.20,25

preparation procedures. (b, c) Cyclic voltammograms
of NTA electrodes in 100 mM KPi buffer at pH 7.2.

Cobalt-loaded Am-NTA (Co/Am-NTA) was prepared by dipping
Am-NTA
into 250 mM Co(NO3)2/ethanol solution. The sample
was dipped into the coating solution for 1 min, pulled up at the rate
of 10 mm/min, and finally dried at room temperature for 2 min. The
dip-coating processes were repeated three times. The Co loading was
determined by ICP-MS (Agilent 8800) as 0.54 ± 0.12 μmol/cm2. Lowering the Co(NO3)2 concentration
in the dip-coating solutions to 50 and 25 mM produced Co(0.25)- and
Co(0.17)-Black NTA with Co loadings of 0.25 and 0.17 μmol/cm2, respectively.

Annealing Am-NTA and Co/Am-NTA in air
at 450 °C for 1 h yieldeds
NTA and Co-NTA, respectively. Black NTA and Co-doped Black NTA (Co-Black)
were obtained by annealing Am-NTA and Co/Am-NTA in a stream of 5%
H2/Ar at 450 °C for 30 min and then naturally cooling
to room temperature. The Blue NTA was prepared by applying a cathodic
current of 5 mA cm–2 on the NTA electrode for 10
min in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer solution (KPi). All of the
thermally treated NTAs were determined to be in the anatase phase
by XRD (Figure S1). Five control samples
were prepared. (1) A cobalt-doped TiO2 (Co-TiO2) film electrode was prepared by spray-coating a mixture of 250 mM
titanium–glycolate complex and 25 mM Co(NO3)2 onto a Ti plate, followed by annealing in air at 450 °C
for 1 h.26 The final mass loading of Co-TiO2 was 6 mg/cm2. The molar Co loading was 0.6 μmol/cm2. (2) Amorphous cobalt hydroxide was loaded onto a Ti plate
(Co(OH)x/Ti) by the electrochemical deposition
method described previously,27 with the
modification of replacing the glassy-carbon substrate with a titanium
plate. (3) Cobalt oxide was coated onto the Ti plate (CoOx/Ti) by a drop-casting method using 250 mM Co(NO3) in ethanol as precursor, followed by annealing under 5%
H2/Ar at 450 °C for 30 min. (4) IrO2 DSA
anodes were prepared by spray-coating an IrCl3/isopropyl
alcohol solution onto a hot Ti plate (6 cm2, 0.5 mm) at
300 °C, followed by annealing at 450 °C for 1 h.26 The mass loading of IrO2 was 0.5
mg cm–2. (5) Commercial IrO2 DSA (C-DSA)
was purchased from Nanopac, Korea.

Catalyst Characterization
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were measured using a
Biologic VSP-300 potentiostat. Uncompensated resistance (Ru) was measured by EIS. All of the presented anodic potentials
were corrected by Ru. EIS was also used
to determine Mott–Schottky plots. These details are described
in Text S2 of the Supporting Information.
For two-point solid-state measurements, nanotube tops were contacted
by sputter-evaporated 10 nm thick Au using a Cressington 208HR sputter
coater. Then resistance was obtained from the I–V curves collected by potentiostat.

After CV analyses,
NTA electrodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM, ZEISS 1550VP) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, FEI TF30ST)
equipped with a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Surface Science M-Probe ESCA/XPS,
and X-ray diffractometry (PANalytical X’Pert Pro). Electron
paramagnetic resonance spectra were collected on a Bruker EMX X-band
CW-EPR spectrometer at room temperature and 10 K. Powder samples were
collected by scraping NTA from the Ti metal substrate.

X-ray Absorption
Spectroscopy
X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(XAS) of Ti L-edge and O K-edge were measured on Beamline 8.0.1 at
the Advanced Light Source (ALS), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
The resolutions of the measurements were 0.4 eV at the O K-edge and
0.3 eV at the Ti L-edge. Spectra were recorded in total electron yield
mode (TEY) and were obtained by measurement of the sample drain photocurrent
under irradiation with monochromatic light. The XAS at Co K-edge was
conducted at BL17C1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research
Center, Taiwan. The photon energy calibrations of the XAS spectra
at the Ti L-edge and O K-edge were conducted on the basis of the reference
anatase TiO2 films. The incident radiation flux was monitored
by the photocurrent produced in a gold mesh in the beam path. All
spectra were normalized to the incident flux recorded with Au mesh.

Cobalt Leaching and Anodic Stability Testing
The Co-Black
NTA electrodes were subjected to cathodization (−5 mA/cm2, 10 min), CV (−0.5 to +3 VRHE, 10 mV s–1), and four continuous stages of constant current
electrolysis (10 mA cm–2) at an interval of 3 h.
At the end of each step, a water sample was collected, acidified by
HNO3, and then analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent 8800) to determine
the Co concentration. The electrolyte was replaced before the next
test. The anodic stability test was performed following the constant
current Co leaching test. Current density was maintained at 10 mA
cm–2. Electrolyte was replaced every 12 h.

OER, CER,
and Water Treatment Tests
OER activities
were evaluated using Tafel plots, which were collected by potentiostat
with a three-electrode configuration. Stainless steel and saturated
Ag/AgCl were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
Data were collected at constant current mode (0.01–10 mA cm–2). Each current step was maintained for 5 min to measure
the steady-state anodic potential.

Hydroxyl radical production
and direct electron transfer activities were measured using benzoic
acid and oxalate as probe molecules, respectively. Benzoic acid was
measured by HPLC (Agilent 1100) equipped with a Zorbax XDB column.
Oxalate was analyzed by ion chromatography (ICS 2000, Dionex). Free
chlorine concentrations ([FC]) were measured using the DPD (N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine)
reagent (Hach method 10102). The current efficiency was estimated
using the equation 1  where V is electrolyte volume
(25 mL), F is the Faraday constant (96485 C mol–1), and I is the current (A). Chemical
oxygen demand (COD) in wastewater was determined by the dichromate
digestion method (Hach Method 8000). NH4+ was
quantified by ion chromatography.

Latrine wastewater was collected
from a recycling electrochemical
toilet system located on the Caltech campus (Pasadena, CA). The latrine
wastewater has a pH of around 8.5 with a conductivity of 13.5 mS cm–1. It contains 500 mg L–1 COD and
18.5 mM NH4+. During the electrolysis of latrine
wastewater, the Co-Black and IrO2 electrodes were operated
at 10 mA cm–2 with cell voltages of 4.6 and 4 V,
respectively. The electrode area/wastewater volume ratio was set as
60 m–1.

Results and Discussion
The electrochemical activity of electrodes was determined by cyclic
voltammetry (CV) in potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KPi) buffer solutions.
The anodic branch current response is due to the OER. Both NTA and
Co-NTA have low OER activity, as indicated by the low current densities
of Figure 1b. The Co-TiO2 film electrode has higher current response in comparison
to NTA and Co-NTA, but its performance is inferior to that of conductive
NTA electrodes (Figure 1b vs Figure 1c). An
increase in current response is observed on both the Blue and Black
NTA electrodes at onset potentials of 2.7 and 1.7 V, respectively
(Figure 1c). Co-Black
NTA has the highest OER activity due to its lower onset potential
and its higher current density. There have been previous reports that
Co-doped TiO2 nanotubes could be used as photoelectrochemical
water-splitting catalysts.28−31 However, their photocurrent densities are less than
5 mA/cm2. In a recent report, Co3O4/TiO2 nanotubes were used for dark water electrolysis.32 However, it appeared that TiO2 functioned
only as an inert substrate for Co3O4 with resulting
current densities <1 mA/cm2 at an applied potential
of 2.3 VRHE. These results are in agreement with the inert
performance observed on a Co-TiO2 film electrode with 0.6
μmol/cm2 Co loading prepared in this study. In contrast,
Co-Black NTA with less Co loading (0.54 μmol/cm2)
exhibits 200 times higher current density in comparison with a Co-TiO2 film electrode at 2.3 VRHE. This finding highlights
the promotional role of conductive NTA substrate on the OER activity
of Co-TiO2 system.

The anodic stability of the NTA
electrodes at circumneutral pH
was determined by applying a constant current of 10 mA cm–2 in a KClO4 electrolyte solution. Deactivation of the
electrode was determined from the sharp increase in anodic potential
(Figure 2a). The Blue
and Black NTAs have lifetimes of 2.3 and 4 h, respectively, which
are in line with previous studies.20,21 A substantially
longer lifetime and apparent stability (>200 h) were observed for
the Co-Black NTA electrode (Figure 2b). Lowering the Co loading to 0.25 and 0.17 μmol/cm2 does not affect the stability of Co-Black NTA within the
investigated 100 h electrolysis (Figure S2a). The results suggest that a trace amount of the Co dopant is sufficient
to significantly enhance the stability of Black NTA.

the anodic stability of the NTA electrodes

(insert: comparison of stability of Co-Black NTA and Black NTA in
0.5 M H2SO4). (d) Effect of electrolyte composition
on cobalt leaching from the NTA electrode material.

Figure 2c shows
that the Co-Black electrode is also stable in 1.0 M KOH. However,
deactivation occurs after 45 h in 0.5 M H2SO4. Nevertheless, Co-Black electrode still has a longer lifetime than
Black NTA (insert of Figure 2c). We further investigated the leaching of Co in different
electrolytes at cathodic (−5 mA cm–2), fluctuating
(CV), and anodic (10 mA cm–2) currents (Figure 2d). Complete dissolution
of Co from Co-Black was observed after sequential cathodization, CV,
and 12 h electrolysis in H2SO4. In contrast,
only 2.1% of Co was lost under similar conditions in the KOH electrolyte.
Retarded Co leaching is also observed in the 0.1 M KPi electrolyte;
this is probably due to the formation of less soluble CoPi.33,34 In addition, the leaching of Co from Co-Black is undetectable (<0.03%)
by ICP-MS after 9 h of electrolysis in KClO4 in the absence
of phosphate. Analyses by SEM-EDS and STEM-HAADF indicate that Co
is well dispersed in Co-rich spots on Co-Black throughout the tube
length. CoOx particles were not found
(Figures S3–S6).

Two-point
solid-state conductivity measurements show that the resistances
of Blue, Black, and Co-Black NTA electrodes are 5 orders of magnitude
lower than that of pristine NTA electrodes (Figure S7). Knowing that the above measurements may be interfered
by the contact resistance of Au coating, we further probed the semimetallic
properties of conductive NTA by EIS using liquid electrolyte contacts
(Figure S8). The Blue, Black, and Co-Black
NTA all have good conductivity, but their OER activities vary. This
implies that, in addition to bulk conductivity considerations, surface
specific characteristics need to be considered.

Both electrochemical
and thermal reduction should promote the formation
of Ti3+ sites and adjacent oxygen vacancies (Ovs) on TiO2. However, aside from Ti4+, X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) cannot confirm the existence of Ti3+ on Blue and Black NTA, probably due to the reoxidation of
Ti3+ to Ti4+ in ambient air (Figure S9). Nevertheless, the oxidation of Ti3+ is essentially the filling of Ov by adsorbed oxygen species,
which can be detected by XPS (Figure S10). The relative concentration of absorbed oxygen species is associated
with the abundance of nascent Ov. The XPS O 1s spectrum
reveals that the concentration of oxygen vacancies (Ov)
decreases in the order Black (22%) > Blue (17%) > pristine NTA
(12%).
XPS analyses also found that Co doping results in a significant reduction
in the Ti oxidation state in Co-Black NTA and creates more surficial
Ov (25%) (Figures S9 and S10).

The NTA samples were further investigated using X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS) operated in total electron yield (TEY) mode. The
results obtained from TEY mode involved both surface and subsurface
characteristics, as XAS has a larger sampling depth in comparison
to XPS. The Ti L-edge XAS is shown in Figure 3a. The spectra that result from the transition
of electrons from the Ti 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 initial
states to the unoccupied 3d orbital. Peaks A–C correspond to
the electronic transition from 2p3/2 to 3d, while peaks
D and E can be assigned to the transition from 2p1/2 to
3d.35 The single crystal of TiO2 has octahedral (Oh)
symmetry. The Oh crystal
field splits the Ti 3d band into t2g and eg degenerate
orbitals. The excitation of electrons from the ground state of Ti4+ to t2g orbital can be expressed as 2p63d0 → 2p53d1, which is reflected
as the energy absorption at 458 eV (peak A). Ti3+ (2p63d1) already has one electron in the t2g orbital, which reduces the number of unoccupied states. Therefore,
the presence of Ti3+ leads to the reduction of t2g relative intensity and eg peak width broadening.35 The lesser resolved peaks B and C, the reduction
of the A/B intensity ratio (Figure 3c), and the shift of peak A to lower energy confirm
the presence of Ti3+ in Blue and Black NTA as well.35,36 The O K-edge XAS is shown in Figure 3b. Peaks a and b can be assigned to the electronic
transition from O 1s to O 2p hybridized with the Ti 3d t2g and 3d eg states, respectively.37,38 The peak intensity ratio of t2g to eg is lower
in Blue and Black NTA (Figure 3c), which suggests the presence of more Ti3+ and
Ov.35 In agreement with the
XPS analyses, Co-Black has the highest number of Ti3+ and
Ov, sites as supported by the lowest peak A/B and a/b ratios
in XAS (Figure 3c).

Figure 3 (a) Ti
L-edge, (b) O K-edge XAS spectra, and (c) intensity ratio
of specific peaks. (d) Co K-edge XAS spectra (insert: enlarged view
of pre-edge structure).

We further investigated the oxidation state and coordination
environment
of Co dopant by XAS. The absorption edge in Co K-edge XAS spectra
of Co-Black overlaps with that of CoO (Figure 3d); this implies that surficial Co ions of
Co-Black are in valence 2+, which is in line with the XPS analyses
(Figure S9), and the EPR results (vide
infra). The pre-edge peaks of CoO and Co3O4 correspond
to the 1s–3d electronic transitions contributed by the tetrahedrally
coordinated Co2+. This feature is less pronounced for Co-Black,
indicating that Co2+ is in an Oh configuration in which 1s–3d electronic transitions
rarely occur.39 The overall Co K-edge profile
of Co-Black is different from that of CoO and Co3O4. This results again suggest that the coordination structure
of Co2+ ions in Co-Black is clearly different from that
of oxide particles. Given that no CoOx particulates could be found by both SEM and TEM, it is possible
that Co2+ is atomically doped into the lattice of TiO2, adopting the same Oh configuration. This assumption needs to be verified by aberration-corrected
TEM in a future study.

The coordination structure of Co2+ remains intact after
100 h of electrolysis, as indicated by the unchanged Co K-edge profiles
of Co-Black before and after use (Figure 3d). Of note, XPS data indicated that Co2+ in Co-NTA was prepared by annealing the Co(NO3)2 loaded Am-NTA in air, even though the calcination of
Co(NO3)2 alone produced Co3O4 (i.e., a mixed Co(III)/Co(II) material). (Figure S9). These observations combined suggest that Co2+ is effectively immobilized on NTA and its reduced valence
state does not result from H2 reduction but from a strong
Co–TiO2 interaction. It is noteworthy that Co2+ in CoOx is a labile OER intermediate
that tends to be dissolved at neutral pH in the absence of phosphate.23,33 Our findings suggest that the Co–TiO2 interaction
is strong enough to prevent Co leaching at circumneutral pH. These
results could provide a new strategy to prepare stable CoOx-based OER catalysts.

NTA samples were scraped
off from Ti substrate for EPR characterization.
The EPR signals of powdered NTA samples should mainly reflect their
bulk characteristics. Signals were normalized by sample weight in
order to perform semiquantitative comparison. The EPR signal at a g value of 2.003 could be attributed to electrons localized
on Ov.14,40 As shown above, XPS and XAS unambiguously
point out that Blue NTA has more surficial Ov than pristine
NTA. However, higher bulk phase Ov concentration is not
observed on Blue NTA, as shown by EPR (Figure 4a), implying that electrochemical reduction
only results in changes on the surface/subsurface of Blue NTA. The
results seem to be reasonable, since the mild electrochemical reduction
that was carried out at room temperature is less likely to dislodge
bulk lattice oxygen. In contrast, H2-assisted thermal reduction
largely increases the bulk Ov concentration of Black NTA,
which is reflected as an 80 times increase in peak intensity in the
EPR spectrum (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 EPR spectra recorded at (a, b) room temperature and (c) 4 K (inset:
the enlarged area at a g value of 1.4–2.6).
(d) Schematic illustrations of electron conduction mechanisms.

In comparison with Black NTA,
Co-Black has an Ov signal
with lower intensity (Figure 4b). However, such a discrepancy is eliminated in EPR spectra
recorded at 10 K (Figure 4c). In addition, Co-Black shows an EPR signal at g = 4.2, which could be assigned to high-spin (S =
3/2) Co2+ in an Oh environment.41 The results combined
imply (1) the bulk Ov concentration of Co-Black NTA is
commensurate with that of Black NTA and (2) the Co2+ centers
enhance relaxation of unpaired electrons of neighboring Ov sites. As a consequence, the Ov resonance signal of Co-Black
is attenuated at room temperature. As shown in the inset of Figure 4c, resonance signals
at g = 1.92, which can be attributed to Ti3+,42 were observed on both Black and Co-Black
NTA. The Co-Black NTA has more Ti3+ sites, resulting in
a higher signal intensity.

The Ti3+–Ov pairs serve as electron
donors to facilitate bulk conductivity. Thus, the elevated conductivity
of Black NTA and Co-Black NTA in comparison with pristine NTA can
be assigned to the increase in bulk Ov concentration (Figure 4d). For the Blue
NTA, the mechanism seems to be more complicated. It is suspected that
electrochemical reduction only makes the surface/subsurface of Blue
NTA conductive. Thanks to its vertically aligned tubular structure,
electrons are able to transfer to the Ti substrate through the “conductive
skin” of Blue NTA. In contrast, as we proved previously, the
TiO2 film electrode without such a structure cannot gain
anodic conductivity after electrochemical reduction,20 probably due to the presence of underlying, insulating
bulk TiO2.

Good conductivity is a prerequisite for
electrocatalysts, while
their catalytic activity is determined by the number of active sites.
The surficial Ov is generally considered as an active site
for the OER.43,44 It exposes unsaturated metal
ions, which in turn lead to the adsorption and dissociation of H2O.45,46 Black NTA has more surficial
Ov sites and thus has a lower onset potential for the OER
and a correspondingly higher activity in comparison to the Blue NTA.
Clearly, the highest observed OER activity of Co-Black NTA electrodes
can be attributed to the higher abundance of Ov. The pristine
NTA also has surficial Ov, but the lack of bulk Ov impedes bulk phase electron transport. As a consequence, pristine
NTA has no discernible OER activity. The same rule can be invoked
to explain the inert OER activity of Co-NTA and Co-TiO2 film electrode (Figure 1b).

Computational simulation using density functional
theory (DFT)
was performed to provide insight into the mechanism of Co–TiO2 interactions at an atomic level (detail can be found in Text S1). Simulations were focused on the TiO2 (101) plane because (1) as observed by HRTEM (Figure S5a), the tube wall is mainly composed
of (101) plane, which in line with the observation of a previous study,47 and (2) XRD analyses show that the (101) plane
is sensitive to surface fabrication, as the Co doping only affects
the crystallinity of the (101) plane, while other planes remain intact
(Figure S1). The DFT simulation found that
Ov formation is more favorable by 3.6 eV when the neighboring
Ti is substituted by Co (Figure 5). This is because Co forms a weaker bond with O in
comparison to Ti, as reflected in the formation energy of TiO2 (−3.5 eV atom–1) in comparison to
the Co oxides (Co3O4, −1.4 eV atom–1; CoO, −1.3 eV atom–1; CoO2, −1.1 eV atom–1).48 The simulation also shows that the O atoms which are not
directly bonded to Co tend to form vacancies as well, indicating a
nonlocal effect. Since the formation of Ov reduces the
coordination of the metal ions, the apparent oxidation states should
be lower than those sites in the pristine material. This interpretation
is in line with the reduced Ti and Co valence states in Co-Black.

(top panel) and side view (bottom panel). Color code: cyan, Ti; red,
O; blue, Co. The black lines indicate the vectors of the surface supercell.
The numbers show the magnitude of the relative formation energy of
the corresponding oxygen vacancy.

The results of the DFT simulation imply that Co doping could
thermodynamically
stabilize surficial Ov. This mechanism has a significant
effect on electrode lifetime. For both Blue and Black NTA, deactivation
could be ascribed to surface passivation due to the irreversible uptake
of oxygen and subsequent loss of Ov during prolonged OER.
As shown in Figure 6, a reduction in the Ov concentration from 22% to 16%
was found on Black NTA after deactivation, while such a change could
not be observed on Co-Black. The hypothesis presented above may explain
the superior stability of Co-Black in comparison to Black NTA in H2SO4 electrolyte solutions (insert of Figure 2c). The leaching of Co from
Co-Black under acidic conditions may create additional Ovs, which in turn enables Co-Black to have a longer lifetime than
Black NTA. However, the newly formed Ovs will not be stabilized
by Co due to its loss via leaching from the Co-Black NTA matrix. Therefore,
the deactivation will take place over time under acidic conditions.

and Co-Black NTA before and after long-term electrolysis.

were loaded on
Black NTA electrodes by dip coating. It is found that Ni-Black and
Fe-Black NTA electrodes exhibit improved stability in comparison with
Black NTA but they still suffered from deactivation after 40 h of
electrolysis in KClO4 electrolyte (Figure S2a). No residual Ni and Fe could be detected on the
deactivated electrodes, indicating the complete dissolution of NiOx and FeOx, which
may be the cause of deactivation. From a thermodynamic point of view,
the Pourbaix diagrams (Figure S2b) also
indicate that NiOx and FeOx are more vulnerable to corrosion than CoOx under the conditions of a stability test (2.4–2.7
VRHE, pH 7). These results again highlight the importance
of a strong Co–TiO2 interaction on maintaining the
anodic stability of Co-Black NTA electrode.

Two electrochemical
applications, the OER and wastewater electrolysis,
were tested using the Co-Black electrode. A IrO2 DSA and
a C-DSA with the same geometric surface area were chosen as reference
benchmarks, since the DSA-IrO2 electrode is generally recognized
as an inherent standard for both OER and wastewater treatment. Tafel
plots (Figure 7 and Figure S11) indicate that Co-Black is less OER
active than IrO2 DSA at both neutral and alkaline pH.

Figure 7 Tafel
plots in different electrolytes. Co*- and Co**-Black were
prepared by drop-casting 250 mM Co(NO3)2/ethanol
precursor on Co-Black, followed by annealing in 5% H2/Ar
at 450 °C for 30 min. CoOx/Ti was
prepared by the same procedure except that a Ti plate was used as
the supporting substrate. The Co loading was 2.1 μmol cm–2 for Co*-Black and 4.2 μmol cm–2 for Co**-Black and CoOx/Ti.

It is found that the OER activity of Co-Black can
be enhanced by
increasing the Co loading. A Co(NO3)2/ethanol
solution was drop-casted onto a Co-Black electrode. The sample was
then reduced in 5% H2/Ar at 450 °C for 30 min. During
annealing, a discrete film layer of amorphous CoOx formed on top of Co-Black (Figures S12 and S13). The XPS analyses (Figure S14) indicate that the Co of the CoOx film
has higher valence (3+/2+) than that of Co-Black (2+) due to the absence
of a Co–TiO2 interaction. The Co*-Black composite
electrode with a Co loading of 2.1 μmol cm–2 has overpotentials of 360 and 434 mV, respectively, at 1.0 and 10
mA cm–2 in 1 M KOH (Figure 7b). Increasing the Co loading to 4.2 μmol
cm–2 gave a Co**-Black electrode with an even higher
OER activity; this electrode has overpotentials of 289 and 352 mV
at 1.0 and 10 mA cm–2, respectively (Figure 7b). The performance of Co**-Black
is not only higher than those of IrO2 DSA, C-DSA, and Co(OH)x/Ti but also superior to the reported activities
of a benchmarking Co(OH)x/GC (400 mV at
10 mA cm–2),27 Co3O4 nanowires (320 mV at 1 mA cm–2),49 Co3O4 nanosheets
(390 mV at 10 mA cm–2),46 and Co@Co3O4 nanoparticles (420 mV at 10 mA
cm–2).50 A detailed comparison
of alkaline OER performance and catalyst parameters is provided in Table S1. The composition of the CoOx film was not optimized for the OER in this study.
It is reasonable to believe that a higher OER activity could be achieved
by doping Ni and Fe into the CoOx film.51,52

The higher OER activity of Co**-Black electrode could be attributed
to two primary factors. First, more OER active sites are created by
the CoOx film. This effect is illustrated
in Figure S15, which shows that the double-layer
capacitance, which is proportional to the electrochemically active
surface area (ECSA), increases in the order Co-Black (7.5) < Co*-Black
(12.4) < Co**-Black (21.4 mF cm–2). Co**-Black
with 6 cm2 geometric area has a large ECSA of 3210 cm2, giving a roughness factor of 535 (Table S1). As shown in Figure S14, XPS
analyses prove that Co**-Black has a higher Ov concentration
(32%) than Co-Black (25%). The Ovs of CoOx are surrounded by Co ions (Co–Ov–Co),45,46 which should be intrinsically more OER active than the Co–Ov–Ti and Ti–Ov–Ti sites of
Co-Black. Second, the antipassivation functionality of Co-Black facilitates
charge transport from the CoOx film to
Co-Black NTA and then to the Ti metal support underneath. For comparison,
CoOx was directly loaded onto a Ti plate
(CoOx/Ti) and the corresponding OER activity
was determined. Even though the Ti substrate has a higher conductivity
in comparison to Co-Black (Figure S7),
the CoOx/Ti composite electrode was found
to has a lower OER activity in comparison to the Co**-Black electrode
(Figure 7b). As illustrated
in Figure S16, Co**-Black is stable for
more than 200 h in 1.0 M KOH at 10 mA cm–2. In contrast,
a gradual deactivation is observed for CoOx/Ti. Overall, these results indicate that the presence of Co-Black
NTA as an interlayer prevents the passivation of the catalyst/Ti interface,
which is a major challenge affecting the stability of DSA electrodes.53

Although the Co-Black electrode is relatively
inert with respect
to the OER in comparison to a conventional IrO2 DSA, it
is found to be more active for the electrochemical production of reactive
oxygen species and other oxidants (i.e., reactive chlorine species).
Electrolysis of a 30 mM NaCl solution shows that Co-Black has a higher
chlorine evolution rate (CER) than IrO2 DSA (Figure S17a). Using benzoic acid and oxalate
ion as probe molecules, we show that Co-Black outperforms an IrO2 DSA in terms of hydroxyl radical (•OH)
generation and direct electron transfer oxidation (Figure S17b,c).

Co-Black was further applied for the
treatment of latrine wastewater
that was collected on the Caltech campus in a prototype solar toilet
system.26,54 Chloride (40 mM) that originated from human
waste (i.e., urine) is oxidized to chlorine (e.g., HOCl, ClO–). Hypochlorous acid, HOCl, reacts with ammonia (NH3/NH4+) to form chloramines (e.g., NH2Cl,
NHCl2), which in turn undergo a self-reaction leading to
denitrification with the offgassing of N2 leading eventually
to breakpoint chlorination.26,54 Co-Black outperforms
the IrO2 DSA due to its higher CER activity (Figure 8a). Although C-DSA has a higher
CER (Figure S17), it still exhibits inferior
NH4+ removal performance in comparison to Co-Black.
This is probably because Co-Black is more active for the removal of
organics, which compete with NH4+ to react with
chlorine. Both chlorine and •OH contribute to the
removal of organic pollutants (indexed in terms of chemical oxygen
demand, COD). As expected, the COD removal capability of Co-Black
is superior to that of IrO2 DSA and C-DSA (Figure 8b). The effluent after 8 h
of treatment is clear in appearance and suitable for nonpotable water
reuse (Figure 8c).

Conclusions
In conclusion, the results
of this study show that Co doping significantly
extends the lifetime of Black NTA electrodes via tuning of the concentration
and stability of oxygen vacancies, Ov. Co-Black electrodes
are shown to be effective in terms of electrochemical oxidation. Co-Black
electrodes also function as the conductive substrates for CoOx-based OER catalysts. The simplicity of the
synthetic procedures suggests that conductive TiO2 NTA
could be utilized for energy storage and industrial applications on
a wider scale, provided that the operational lifetimes can be extended
further.
