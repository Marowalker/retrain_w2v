Alkyl xanthate esters are perhaps
best known for their use in deoxygenation
chemistry. However, their use in cross-coupling chemistry has not
been productive, which is due, in part, to inadequate xanthate activation
strategies. Herein, we report the use of O-benzyl
xanthate esters, readily derived from alcohols, as radical pronucleophiles
in Csp3–Csp2 cross-couplings under Ni/photoredox
dual catalysis. Xanthate (C–O) cleavage is found to be reliant
on photogenerated (sec-butyl) radical activators
to form new carbon-centered radicals primed for nickel-catalyzed cross-couplings.
Mechanistic experiments support the fact that the key radical components
are formed independently, and relative rates are carefully orchestrated,
such that no cross reactivity is observed.

Traditional two-electron, metal-catalyzed
Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling reactions provide
efficient and selective access to architecturally rich molecules.
However, challenges remain, with regard to accessing reliable and
abundant alkyl nucleophiles for this class of coupling transformations.1 In particular, reactive alkylmetallic reagents
(RMgX, RZnX, RLi, etc.) have generally limited functional group tolerance,2 although advances in overcoming these barriers
have been realized.3 More functional group-tolerant
reagents, such as organoboron and organosilicon reagents, often lack
the reactivity needed to overcome a rate-limiting transmetalation
for effective cross-coupling.

The recent advent of Ni/photoredox
dual catalysis by this group
and others4 has surfaced as a complementary
and mild alternative to traditional two-electron Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling strategies, taking advantage of a relatively
low-barrier interception of alkyl radicals by nickel catalysts,5 ultimately accessing high-valent Ni(III) intermediates.
To date, substrate and functional group tolerance, under this single-electron
cross-coupling paradigm, has been exceptional.6 In hopes of further expanding this synthetic toolbox and chemical
space, novel radical precursors derived from abundant feedstock molecules
(e.g., alkyl aldehydes7 and alkylsilanes8) have been targeted that are compatible under
this dual catalytic manifold.

Alcohols remain one of the most
abundant, naturally occurring organic
synthons, and they carry with them enormous molecular diversity. Within
cross-coupling contexts, select sp3-hybridized alcohol
derivatives have been implemented as carbon electrophiles in low-valent, nickel-catalyzed reactions because of their inherent
C–O bond polarization,9 but have
rarely functioned as precursors to nucleophilic entities.10 A compelling alternative to C–O bond
activation would be the ability to form carbon-centered radicals that
might be parlayed toward new C–C bond-forming reactions. Although
the strong C–O σ bond (bond dissociation energy (BDE)
of ∼96 kcal/mol) presents operational challenges, this strategy,
if broadly applied, may offer advantages, particularly in accessing
more available and diverse coupling partners.

O-Alkyl thiocarbonate (xanthate) esters (R1OCSSR2) are attractive, bench-stable reagents in
their ability to generate carbon radicals under Barton–McCombie-type
conditions and are readily prepared in one step from a variety of
alcohol feedstocks.11 Under these processes, O-alkyl xanthates are traditionally fragmented with an excess
of a reducing agent (e.g., HSnBu3) and substoichiometric
amounts of radical initiator (AIBN, peroxide, etc.) to prolong the
radical chain event (e.g., Figure 1). A deoxygenation reaction employing specially tailored O-thiocarbamates (Ered(average) ≈ −1.55 V vs SCE) was recently reported, and these
derivatives undergo a photocatalyzed, reductive single electron transfer
(SET).12

Figure 1 Radical cleavage of xanthate esters and
application under Ni/photoredox
dual catalysis.

Inspirational to this
work, an alternative approach to the classic
deoxygenation using Bu3SnH and AIBN, for example, employs
BEt3 and O2 as the initiator under otherwise
relatively mild reaction conditions (benzene, H2O, room
temperature).13 The generated ethyl radical
reacts with the xanthate ester, initiating
a C–O bond scission event (Figure 1) to produce a new carbon-centered radical
that may be rapidly quenched by a hydrogen source, furnishing the
reduced adduct.14 Since these pioneering
studies, ethyl radical initiators (via BEt3/O2) have been widely adopted in various synthetic capacities,15 although experimental challenges are common.16

We envisioned using carbon radical activators,
generated mildly
via SET photo-oxidation, to fragment suitable xanthate esters in cooperation
with Ni catalysis, allowing access to new Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupled structures. This method would constitute an umpolung of reactivity, because alcohol derivatives in cross-coupling
protocols are typically electrophilic (e.g., OMs, OMe), especially
under Ni catalysis.9 To our knowledge, O-alkyl xanthate esters have never been employed as either
electrophiles or nucleophiles in cross-coupling chemistry.17 In a broader sense, this approach may also validate photo-oxidizable radical precursors as alternatives to pyrophoric
BEt3/O2 systems.

Conceptually, an excited-state
photocatalyst ([PC]*; see Scheme 1) may be sufficiently
oxidizing to generate an alkyl radical activator (blue) from an established
radical precursor (e.g., Y = BF3K, CO2M, or
ammonium silicate). This alkyl radical activator could rapidly react
with the thiocarbonyl of the xanthate pronucleophile, initializing
C–O bond fragmentation. With subsequent xanthate cleavage and
extrusion of dithiocarbonate, the alcohol-derived carbon radical (red),
may enter the Ni coupling cycle, adding to Ni(0) as delineated in
our previous studies.18 Following Ni(I)
oxidative addition with the requisite aryl halide, a Ni(III) intermediate
may be reached, producing the desired alkylated arene via reductive
elimination. A SET event from the reduced form of the photocatalyst
may regenerate Ni(0) from the Ni(I) species to close the intertwined
dual catalytic cycles (see Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Proposed Ni/Photoredox Dual Catalytic Cross-Coupling
of O-Alkyl Xanthates Initiated by a Radical Activator
There were several evident
challenges with the proposed reaction
design. Radical hetero(homo)dimerization would result from multiple
radicals simultaneously present, which is a challenge in multicomponent
radical reactions. In addition, thiols and sulfides are well-known
metal complexing agents, potentially inhibiting reaction progression
through nickel sequestration.19 Perhaps
most critically, the two radical components must have differentiable
reactivity. The nucleophilic radical activator (blue) should be designed
to react with the thiocarbonyl electrophile in preference to the nickel
catalyst (e.g., eq 2 is desired over eq 3; see Scheme 2) to effect, first, the irreversible C–O
cleavage. The stoichiometric concentration of xanthate was anticipated
to assist in this selectivity. The xanthate-derived radical (red)
must then react smoothly with the nickel catalyst (eq 4 is desired
over eq 5; see Scheme 2) with little to no cross reactivity. The potential advantage of
using photoredox catalysis in this scenario is the ability to produce
precise, substoichiometric quantities of reactive radical activator
(<2 mol %), in contrast to radical chain processes, where
the concentration of radicals is inherently capricious when using
O2 as the initiator.16

Scheme 2 Potential
Competing Transformations of Radical Components and Ni/Xanthate
Affinity
Studies commenced
with a wide variety of O-alkyl
xanthate esters, including unactivated secondary/primary alkyl xanthates
and activated secondary benzyl xanthates, with aryl bromide 2. We observed promising reactivity with O-benzyl xanthate ester 1a, alongside the bench-stable
[Ni(dtbbpy)(H2O)4]Cl2 (4, 5 mol %) precatalyst.7 Alkylammonium
silicates,6g,8 alkyltrifluoroborates,4c,6a−6c and metal carboxylates4d,20 have been
effective radical precursors, following SET oxidation under photoredox
conditions,21 and all were examined for
their efficacy in xanthate (1a) C–O bond scission
(Table 1; see the Supporting Information for complete studies).
In these preliminary studies, low-molecular-weight alkyltrifluoroborates
(labeled as A–E in Table 1) proved to be the more efficacious
radical initiators, using the photosensitizer [Ir{dFCF3ppy}2(bpy)]PF6 (5), with sec-BuBF3K (A), furnishing 3a in 94% yield (see entry 1 in Table 1) with no undesired radical couplings detected
at room temperature. Cyclopropyltrifluoroborate (C) afforded
no product, likely because of its greater s-character and higher oxidation
potential.6a Organic and inorganic bases
were found to be a hindrance to reaction progression under various
conditions examined. Control experiments revealed that light-emitting
diodes (LEDs), iridium, and nickel catalysts were all necessary components
for this transformation (see entries 2–4 in Table 1). Three equivalents of the
alkyltrifluoroborate is deemed necessary, and all sec-BuBF3K is consumed in the reaction, as determined by 19F NMR monitoring (see the Supporting Information). Comprehensively quantifying the fate of the reagent
could not be fully ascertained. Regardless, the use of the pyrophoric
BEt3 reagent may be replaced with a bench-stable solid.

scale for 48 h, unless otherwise noted. HPLC yields reported as compared

With satisfactory conditions in hand to promote the coupling of
benzyl O-xanthate esters, an array of xanthates (prepared
using base, CS2, MeI, and used without purification) were
examined with bromide 2 (see Scheme 3). Electron-rich and electron-deficient O-benzyl xanthates are similarly well-tolerated under the
conditions. Oxygenated arenes (3b, 3c, 3j), including free phenol (3h), are perhaps
most compatible under the developed dual catalytic conditions. Heteroaromatic,
methanol-derived xanthates are easily prepared and employed, yielding
pyridines (3g), furans (3j), and thiophenes
(3l). These base-free coupling conditions also tolerate
protic functional groups (3f, 3h), where
many analogous, benzyl-derived pronucleophiles (e.g., BnBF3K or BnZnCl, derived from benzyl halides), in contrast, would be
difficult to prepare directly in their unprotected form. Secondary
benzyl and unactivated alkyl xanthates (Chugaev elimination product
could be observed)22 were not well-tolerated
in these studies, even upon mild heating, and often resulted in a
mixture of products.

Scheme 3 O-Benzyl Xanthate and Aryl
Halide Scope
Conditions are as described in Table 1 (entry 1). 0.5 mmol
scale reactions; isolated yields are reported. bTwo equivalents of secBuBF3K employed.

Numerous aryl bromides
were examined next, alongside an O-benzyl xanthate
ester under the optimized conditions (Scheme 3). Electron-deficient
aryl bromides and heteroaryl bromides are quite compatible, although
electron-rich (e.g., 3s) and even electron-neutral bromides
are largely not as robust. Functional handles such as ketones (3o) and nitriles (3n, 3p) are also
well tolerated. Pyridines (3r) and a pyrimidine (3q) can be prepared in moderate to excellent yields (72%–90%).

To showcase the potential utility of benzyl alcohol-derived pronucleophiles,
we explored a bidirectional synthesis of 9 from 4-bromobenzyl
alcohol (7), using sequential Ni/photoredox dual catalyzed
reactions (Scheme 4). Bicycloheptylsilicate 6, which is a secondary alkyl
radical precursor,8 was coupled efficiently
with 7 under mild conditions, yielding intermediate 8. Benzyl alcohol 8 underwent xanthate activation,
and following workup and solvent exchange, reacted smoothly with 3-bromopyrimidine
to furnish the final dialkylated product 9 in 62% yield
over the two-step sequence.

Isolated yields. [Si–] = bis(catechol) ammonium silicate.

Additional experiments aided elucidation of the mechanistic
nuances
of this reaction, and data collected generally support the proposed
dual-catalyzed mechanism. Remarkably, the undesired sec-butyl arene cross-coupled product 10 was never observed
throughout these studies when xanthate was present (Figure 2). However, in the absence
of the xanthate ester under otherwise standard reaction conditions,
full conversion to 10 can be observed,6a,24 critically demonstrating the rapid nature of sec-butyl radical addition to the xanthate thiocarbonyl and the ability
to control reaction outcomes based on relative rates as initially
designed (Figure 2a).
Furthermore, homodimerized radical activator 11 can be
observed in the reaction,23 in addition
to the dialkyl dithiocarbonate 12 byproduct that is generated,
validating the notion that sec-butyl radical is key
to reaction initiation. Studies also revealed that external addition
of dialkyl dithiocarbonate 12 (0.7 equiv) to the reaction
decreased the reaction rate, presumably through nickel coordination.25

Figure 2 Mechanistic studies and observations.

In conclusion, we present the first example of O-benzyl xanthate ester pronucleophiles derived from abundant benzyl
alcohols in Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling
reactions under photoredox/Ni dual catalysis, which is reliant on
the unique generation of radical activators to promote xanthate cleavage.
The mild reaction conditions employ low-molecular-weight, commercially
available potassium alkyltrifluoroborates as radical precursors for
xanthate C–O bond scission under base-free conditions. The
relative rates of two distinct radical components are judiciously
controlled in the reaction, capitalizing on the inherent selectivity
of photoredox catalysis. The development of a versatile new functional
group other than halide derivatives adds an important new dimension
to Csp3–Csp2 cross-coupling chemistry.
