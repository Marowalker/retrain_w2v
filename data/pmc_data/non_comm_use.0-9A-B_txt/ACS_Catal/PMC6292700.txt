The restructuring
of a silver catalyst during ethylene epoxidation
under industrially relevant conditions was investigated without and
with vinyl chloride (VC) promotion. During non-VC-promoted ethylene
epoxidation, the silver particles grow and voids are formed at the
surface and in the bulk. Electron tomography highlighted the presence
of voids below the Ag surface. A mechanism is proposed involving reconstruction
of the silver lattice and defect sites induced by oxygen adsorption
on the external surface and grain boundaries, which finally create
pores. Promotion of the catalytic reaction by VC suppresses to a significant
extent void formation. The use of VC also redisperses silver particles,
initially grown during ethylene epoxidation without VC. This process
is rapid as the average size decreased from 172 to 136 nm within 2
h. These insights emphasize the dynamic nature of the silver particles
during the ongoing ethylene epoxidation reaction and indicate that
particle size and morphology strongly depend on reaction conditions.

==== Body
Ethylene epoxidation toward
ethylene oxide (EO) is a major chemical
process with a worldwide production of ca. 34.5 × 106 tons of EO per year.1 Due to its unique
electronic properties, silver is regarded as the only catalyst that
is sufficiently active and selective for commercial EO production.2 Industrially, a ∼90% EO selectivity is
achieved by the addition of small amounts of solid promoters to the
catalyst such as Cs, Re, and Mo. In addition, a gaseous organochlorine
promotor, e.g., vinyl chloride (VC), often referred to as a moderator,
is cofed on-stream in ppm levels to increase the EO selectivity by
modification of the active sites.3,4 In ethylene
epoxidation under industrial reaction conditions (200–250 °C,
15–20 bar), the initially metallic silver particles partially
oxidize, forming a unique silver and oxygen containing surface for
the catalytic reaction.5,6 A profound influence of the chemical
composition, size, and shape of nanoparticles on the catalytic performance
has been demonstrated for many reactions including epoxidation reactions.7−9 Furthermore, the impact of the catalytic reaction itself on the
structure of the catalyst particles, resulting in dynamic behavior,
has been emphasized.6,10−12 This necessitates
a detailed understanding of how catalytically active structures evolve
under reaction conditions to establish much-sought structure-performance
relations.

The restructuring of silver particles during ethylene
epoxidation
has been investigated in a few studies.7,13−15 It was shown that changes in surface composition, roughness, size,
and shape and the formation of holes can occur. Nevertheless, most
of these findings pertain to model reaction conditions, i.e., usually
atmospheric pressure is employed, and the effect of chlorine promotion
has not been investigated in detail. Here, we systematically investigate
the effect of chlorine, which has a profound effect on stabilizing
the dispersion of silver particles during the ongoing ethylene epoxidation
reaction. Without chlorine, particle restructuring occurs, resulting
in voids as well as a substantial increase in particle size. For this
study, we employed a procedure from the patent literature to prepare
a silver epoxidation catalyst by impregnating the support material
with a solution containing a silver–ethylene diamine precursor
complex.16 The silver catalyst supported
on α-Al2O3 is tested under industrial
conditions (20 bar, 225 °C) in the presence and absence of the
VC promoter (Figure 1a). The silver particle morphology is investigated in dependence
of time on stream using scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) imaging and tomography. Detailed information on sample preparation,
catalytic testing, and characterization is provided in the Supporting Information, section S1.

without and with VC promotion. STEM images of (b) fresh Ag/α-Al2O3 catalyst, (c) Ag(0h)/α-Al2O3, and (d, e) Ag(60h)/α-Al2O3.

The synthesized catalyst contained
a nominal weight loading of
8.2 wt % silver. The XRD pattern (Figure S1) contains peaks corresponding to metallic silver phases as well
as corundum of the α-Al2O3 support. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) proved that all nitrogen from the
precursor complex was completely removed (Figure S2). No evidence of bulk silver oxide was found by XRD, XPS,
or electron diffraction. The average Ag particle size of the fresh
catalyst, as determined by STEM analysis (Figure 1b), is 107 ± 47 nm and is comparable
in size and preparation methods to industrial catalysts.5 The crystalline domain size of the metallic silver
particles is 30 nm (determined by analysis of XRD line widths). This
implies that each silver particle seen in Figure 1b–e is composed of multiple domains
and thus contains grain boundaries.

Before each catalytic test,
a pretreatment in an oxidative environment
(20 bar, 225 °C, 10% O2 in He, 3 h) was performed.
The catalytic performance was evaluated under industrial reaction
conditions (20 bar, 225 °C, 5% C2H4, 10%
O2) for up to 60 h. In the absence of the chlorine promoter
(Figure 1a), the rate
slowly increases over time and stabilizes after ∼20 h, while
the selectivity steadily decreases to 60% after 60 h. When 1 ppm of
VC is cofed, the activity reaches a maximum after 2 h, after which
a fast decrease is observed. Nevertheless, with 1 ppm VC (the optimal
amount for these conditions17), the selectivity
reaches 80% after 10 h and subsequently remains constant. The decrease
in the total rate has been linked to partial coverage of the catalytic
surface by chlorine.18 XPS data indeed
show that, after catalysis with VC, a small amount of Cl is deposited
on the catalyst surface (Figure S2). Our
results are in line with previous studies and are representative for
pure Ag catalysts.18,19

Restructuring of the initially
pore-free fresh catalyst was investigated
in detail by high-angle annular dark-field STEM (HAADF-STEM) imaging
and electron tomography on samples that were tested in ethylene epoxidation
for 0, 2, 20, and 60 h (Table S1). The
0 h sample was only pretreated without exposure to the reaction feed
(Figure 1c). The average
sizes and size distributions of the silver particles are listed in Table 1, and the corresponding
histograms are shown in Figure S4. STEM
images in Figure 1 display
the fresh (Figure 1b), pretreated (Figure 1c), and 60 h on-stream samples in the absence of VC (Figure 1d and e). Using XRD, XPS, and
electron diffraction, no evidence of silver oxide was found in the
spent samples.

sample description in Table S1.

For the reaction without VC, the
initial number-average particle
size is 107 nm (σ = 47 nm). In situ oxidative pretreatment increased
the particle size slightly to 119 nm (σ = 58 nm). When subjected
to ethylene epoxidation at 225 °C, the average particle size
increased to 172 nm and the particle size distribution broadened to
79 nm after 60 h. Importantly, we could establish that substantial
growth of the silver particles did not occur in reference experiments
in which the catalyst was exposed for 60 h to the individual reaction
gases at the same pressure and temperature (Table S3).

Thus, we infer that significant particle growth
is only linked
to ethylene epoxidation. Growth of silver particles during epoxidation
has been discussed before and is thought to occur via Ostwald ripening
or coalescence.20−22 The particle size increase results in a loss of the
silver surface area, in our case of roughly 30%. Despite the loss
of surface area, we observe over time a higher total reaction rate.
This shows that the catalytic activity is not determined by the surface
area only but that changes in the chemical surface composition and
the structure play a significant role.4,7

Most
interestingly, the STEM images (Figure 1d and e) of the 60 h spent sample show clear
voids in the silver particles. Images of these samples were quantified
in terms of pore size and pore frequency per silver particle (Table 1) using in-house developed
software (see Supporting Information section 1 and Figure S8, for example). The average size of the voids
after 60 h epoxidation reaction is 21 nm. We show in the Supporting Information (Figure S5) that void
formation only occurs during epoxidation. Other possible causes such
as the Kirkendall effect during the exposure to the individual gases,
decomposition of silver species during quenching of the reactor, and
electron beam damage have been excluded (Supporting Information section 5). As shown before, voids were not observed
in the fresh sample (Figure 1b) or after oxidative pretreatment (Figure 1c). Thus, our STEM analysis shows that the
ethylene epoxidation reaction leads to sintering of the silver particles
and the appearance of voids.

On the other hand, XRD shows that
the silver crystallite size changes
only very slightly (Table 1). To get a more detailed insight into the void distribution
throughout the silver particles, STEM electron tomography was employed.
Numerical cross sections through silver particles are shown in Figure 2 (see also Figure S9), and a complete reconstruction is
provided in the Supporting Information, Movie 1. From Figure 2, it becomes clear that the voids are located both at the external
surface and in the interior of the silver particles. Voids connected
to the external silver surface are termed “pores” and
are marked blue in Figure 2. Voids located in the interior (without any connection to
the exterior surface) are termed “cavities” and are
marked green. We quantified pores and cavities in terms of location
and size, including the interfacial areas between silver, α-Al2O3, and the vacuum (Table S4). These results show that cavities are located as deep as 60 nm
below the silver surface. The observation of voids inside the silver
particles clarifies that morphological changes are not restricted
to the silver surface (e.g., due to an etching-like process23), but that the formation of cavities also occurs
in the bulk. One possible explanation could be that absorbing reactant
gases on the surface diffuse via the grain boundaries of the particle
and initiate cavity formation. As shown with O2 desorption
(Figure S14), the oxygen capacity of the
silver is well above the monolayer coverage based on the average particle
size (5.3 ML). Taking into account the average crystallite size of
28 nm, we estimate that the coverage of the primary silver crystallites
by O atoms is ∼1 ML. This result strongly suggests that oxygen
can adsorb on the silver particles and O atoms diffuse to subsurface
positions, likely along grain boundaries of the silver crystallites
that make up the large silver particles.24 That is to say, void formation started at the surface of the crystallites
in the outer shell of the silver particles. This implies that the
formation of the pores started before cavity formation. This hypothesis
is strengthened by the observation that the pores are on average a
few nm larger than the cavities and that the pores deepest into the
particle are the smallest (Table S4). Another
indication is that the number of voids is declining deeper into the
bulk of the silver particles. All this provides a reasonable explanation
for the observation that the void size is linked to the presence of
crystalline domains and their grain boundaries. The diffusion of oxygen
along the grain boundaries into silver particles has been observed
before in silver catalysts used for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde.24,25 The relation between the formation of pores and grain boundaries
is further emphasized in Figure S12. Because
no Ag oxide was detected with XRD, XPS, and electron diffraction and
given the fact that Ag2O is thermodynamically unstable
under reaction conditions, we suspect a role of the adsorbed oxygen
layer, both on the external surface and the grain boundaries, opposed
to bulk oxides in the Kirkendall effect. Oxygen adsorption can lead
to the formation of defect sites (vacancies) and the rearrangement
of the metal surface.26,27 These rearrangements have been
argued to cause the pore/hole formation observed for the methanol
oxidation over electrolytic silver. We therefore hypothesize that
repetitive cycles of oxygen adsorption and desorption, which only
occur under reaction conditions, can cause the formation of stacking
faults.28,29 Accumulation of these defects and stacking
faults can finally lead to the formation of the observed pores and
cavities.

are highlighted in green. (b) Surface rendering of silver particles
with pores (blue) and cavities (green). (c) Distances of cavities
and pores to the external surface.

To understand silver particle growth in more detail, we quantified
the particle size at different time-points during the ethylene epoxidation
reaction, also including effects of VC promotion (Table 1 and Figure 3a and b). Representative HAADF-STEM images
and histograms are reported in the Supporting Information (section S4). Table 1 contains the main results of the HAADF-STEM
analysis and highlights that the porosity and number of pores gradually
increases during the ongoing ethylene epoxidation reaction. The average
pore size (∼20 nm) and crystallite size (∼25 nm) remain
constant over time. This further adds evidence to the correlation
between the void size and the size of the silver crystallites. Another
observation is that the average pore size does not change with particle
size. That is to say, only the number of pores depends on the particle
size, while the average porosity remains constant (Figure S11). This implies that the average size of the pores
is always smaller than the average crystalline domain size.

of Ag(60h + 60h)/α-Al2O3.

When the reaction is promoted by 1 ppm of VC, no
significant increase
of the particle size is observed after 60 h of time on stream (Table 1), indicating that
Cl prevents growth of the silver particles. Notably, comparing the
size of the pretreated sample with the spent sample, the silver particles
even become smaller (Table 1, 0 and 60 h, and Figure 3a).

Additionally, in the presence of VC, the
number of pores (and resulting
porosity) is significantly lower than that without VC. A comparable
behavior was observed for ethylene epoxidation reactions carried out
with and without VC at different temperatures and pressures (Figure S10). While VC largely suppressed void
formation, the average size of the voids was slightly larger (∼24
nm) and the XRD crystallize size also increased to ∼32 nm.
Therefore, a correlation between the crystallites (and their grain
boundaries) and the void-formation process seems plausible. One possibility,
based on our data, is that oxygen uptake driven by continued oxidation–reduction
processes creates stacking faults at the surface and grain boundaries,
which then finally nucleate to the observed pores.

To investigate
whether VC influences the size change and void formation
dynamically, a catalyst was first exposed to the standard reaction
conditions without exposure to VC for 60 h. This led to silver particle
sintering (average size 172 nm) and a porosity of 4%. Then, 1 ppm
VC was added to the reaction mixture and the particle size was analyzed
after 2, 20, and 60 h of ethylene epoxidation. Remarkably, analysis
of STEM images shows that the addition of VC led to a substantial
decrease of the average particle size within 2 h to 136 nm. In the
following hours the particle size further decreased to 119 nm (Figure 3a) combined with
a significant narrowing of the size distribution. This effect was
also observed when comparing the pretreated sample (average size 119
nm) with the spent sample only exposed to a reaction mixture containing
1 ppm VC (average size 93 nm) (Figure 3b).

These results confirm that the size increase
of silver particles
can be reversed by the addition of VC to the reaction feed. To support
these conclusions, we ran another reaction for 60 h without VC and
took out part of the catalyst for STEM analysis. The rest of the catalyst
was further subjected to 60 h reaction with 1 ppm VC. The STEM analyses
confirm that after reaction without VC the average particle size of
175 nm was reduced to 121 nm after further reaction with VC; both
data points are within the error of measurement, emphasizing the reproducibility
(Figure S15). Our results are supported
by preceding studies, which found that redispersion of nanoparticles
of platinum, gold, and silver by organohalides such as 1,2,-dichloropropane
is possible.30−32 Opposed to our results, the metallic nanoparticles
completely redispersed via metal-halide intermediate species toward
atomically isolated sites. We do not observe this full redispersion,
neither when VC is added from the start nor after 60 h of reaction.
Therefore, we propose that the redispersion of silver in the ethylene
epoxidation follows a different mechanism. Possible explanations could
be changes in the interaction of the support and changes in the (thermodynamic)
stability of the silver particles that influence the wetting behavior,
or breakup of the particles via grain boundaries, where also the oxidation
of the silver atoms plays an important role.

Concomitant with
silver redispersion, we observed that the presence
of VC drastically decreased the porosity as well as the number of
pores (Table 1, Ag(60h
+ 60h VC)), while the average void size (∼25 nm) and crystallite
size (31 nm) slightly increased. These important findings show that
VC is dynamically changing the bulk structure of the silver particles
rather than suppressing the degree of restructuring by lowering the
reaction rate. Indeed, when decreasing the reaction rate by a lower
operating pressure, the same degree of pore formation is observed
(Figure S10). The idea that the silver
particles are a dynamically evolving system depending on the gas composition
during the ethylene epoxidation reaction has been hypothesized before.23,33,34 Our findings demonstrate that
these dynamics are not limited to the catalyst surface only. Crucially,
they also show that the silver particle size depends on the gas composition
and that the sintering induced in a chlorine-free feed can be reversed
by addition of Cl.

In summary, during the ethylene epoxidation
reaction both an increase
of the size of and the formation of voids in silver particles are
observed as part of a dynamic restructuring process. Void formation
occurs at the surface as well as in the bulk, most likely initiated
close to the grain boundaries of the crystalline subdomains. The observations
that the average pore size and crystallite size are relatively small
and that mainly the number of pores is affected by changes in the
conditions further support the idea that the voids are formed at the
silver crystallite scale.

Tentatively, we propose the following
mechanism. Exposure to oxygen
results in oxygen adsorption on the silver surface and dissolution
of oxygen atoms in the bulk, likely also via diffusion and adsorption
along the grain boundaries between the primary crystallites that make
up the silver particles. At this stage, no voids are formed as observed
for the freshly activated sample and a sample held at reaction conditions
in oxygen for 60 h. Addition of ethylene to the gas feed results in
partial reduction of the surface, resulting in the formation of ethylene
oxide. We speculate that a part of the oxygen dissolved in the bulk
will migrate to the external surface, while at the same time oxygen
is being replenished by diffusion along grain boundaries. The repeating
adsorption of oxygen on the grain boundaries might then lead to stacking
faults and nucleation of voids within a crystallite.

The role
of the pores on the epoxidation reaction is difficult
to assess, because the additional external surface created by the
pores contributes <2% to the overall external Ag surface area (Table S4). Besides extra external surface, the
formed pores could also be beneficial for overall reaction rate, as
they can increase oxygen diffusion into the bulk.29 Additionally, the presence of these pores and cavities
is a strong indication that not only the external surface area of
the silver particle is affected by catalysis but almost the complete
particle is involved. The structural dynamics are therefore multifaceted
and may also influence the sintering and redispersion aspects noted
in this Article. The role of chlorine is mainly to suppress the unwanted
complete oxidation of ethylene.3,4 Chlorine also covers
the surface, so that the total reactivity is significantly suppressed.
Given our observations that chlorine also redisperses silver particles,
we must take into account the fact that highly mobile species can
be formed, such as AgCl species. The high mobility is in line with
the low Tammann temperature of AgCl. Nevertheless, XPS data showed
the presence of minor amounts of Cl in the spent samples, which could
potentially influence the catalyst surface energies. The decrease
of the particle size is likely due to the lower surface tension of
chlorine-terminated silver particles than that of oxygen-terminated
silver particles. To conclude, we have shown in this work that the
ethylene epoxidation reaction affects the entire silver particle structure,
not only the particle surface but also bulk regions. This is very
different from traditional heterogeneous metal catalysis in which
single-crystalline nanoparticles mainly feature surface effects. Our
results demonstrate that silver particle size and morphology evolve
dynamically and reversibly as a function of the reaction conditions.
While sintering is evident during ethylene epoxidation, addition of
chlorine results in smaller particles through a chlorine-induced redispersion
mechanism. These insights add further support to the view that the
active phase in heterogeneous catalysts is strongly dependent on the
reaction conditions.
