A two-point binding mechanism for
the cationic rhodium(I)-catalyzed
carbonyl-directed catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of a cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated
amide is investigated using density functional theory. Geometry optimizations
and harmonic frequency calculations for the model reaction are carried
out using the basis set 6-31+G** for C, O, P, B, N, and H and LANL2DZ
for Rh atoms. The Gibbs free energy of each species in THF solvent
is obtained based on the single-point energy computed using the PCM
model at the ECP28MWB/6-311+G(d,p) level plus the thermal correction
to Gibbs free energy by deducting translational entropy contribution.
The Rh-catalyzed reaction cycle involves the following sequence of
events: (1) chelation of the cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated amide
via alkene and carbonyl complexation in a model active catalytic species,
[Rh(L2)2S2]+, (2) oxidative
addition of pinacol borane (pinBH), (3) migratory insertion of the
alkene double bond into Rh–H (preferred pathway) or Rh–B
bond, (4) isomerization of the resulting intermediate, and finally,
(5) reductive elimination to form the B–C or H–C bond
with regeneration of the catalyst. Free energy profiles for potential
pathways leading to the major γ-borylated product are computed
and discussed in detail. The potential pathways considered include
(1) pathways proceeding via migratory insertion into the Rh–H
bond (pathways I, I-1, and I-2), (2) a potential pathway proceeding via migratory insertion into
the Rh–B bond (pathway II), and two potential
competing routes to a β-borylated byproduct (pathway III). The results find that the Rh–H migratory insertion pathway I-2, followed in sequence by an unanticipated isomerization
via amide rotation and reductive elimination, is the most favorable
reaction pathway. A secondary consequence of amide rotation is access
to a competing β-hydride elimination pathway. The pathways computed
in this study are supported by and help explain related experimental
results.

Recent advances
in methods utilizing
organoboranes in synthesis,1−10 especially chiral organoboranes,11−25 have renewed interest in transition metal catalyzed hydroborations.26−34 Rhodium-catalyzed hydroborations, in particular, often exhibit versatile
chemo-, regio-, and diastereoselectivity,35−41 and among the recent advances in this methodology, Takacs et al.
reported a series of studies on the carbonyl-directed catalytic asymmetric
hydroboration (directed CAHB) of two-point binding unsaturated amides
and esters.42−46 A number of mechanistic studies, both experimental47−49 and theoretical, of rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration have been reported.
However, the prior computational work on the rhodium-catalyzed reaction
focuses on what can be categorized as the reaction via a one-point
binding mechanism (or nondirected catalyzed hydroboration) of a simple
alkene substrate, often styrene, and most often employing a neutral
(i.e., [LnRhCl]2),50−52 rather than cationic (e.g., LnRh(I)BF4),53,54 complex. The model active catalytic
species in the prior computational studies, typically (H3P)2RhCl, is a neutral d8 closed-shell rhodium
complex with a T-shaped geometry. The key mechanistic steps are oxidative
addition of borane to (H3P)2RhCl followed by
the alkene coordination, migratory insertion, and reductive elimination.

In the present work on the directed rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration,
the alkene substrate also contains a nearby amide functionality. The
carbonyl group of amide and C=C π bond of alkene complex
to the cationic rhodium(I) from the same face of the cyclopentenyl
ring system, chelating the metal in a cis fashion. Therefore, we call
this a two-point binding mechanism. Two-point binding is known to
play an important role in directing the selectivity in common variants
of rhodium(I)-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation.55,56

Figure 1 shows the rhodium-catalyzed
amide-directed
CAHB of a cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated amide 1 leading
to the γ-borylated (1R,3S)-2 as the major product.57 Note
that boron is introduced on the more sterically encumbered face of
the alkene, cis with respect to the amide functionality, as anticipated
for a carbonyl-directed reaction; little (i.e., typically 3% or less)
of the isomeric trans-γ-borylated compound
is found. However, (1R,3S)-2 is usually accompanied by a small amount of the β-borylated
isomer 3.

of cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated amide 1.

We investigated energy profiles
using density functional theory
(DFT) calculations for multiple potential pathways involving a two-point
binding mechanism for a model reaction closely related to the CAHB
reaction shown in Figure 1. To reduce the degrees
of freedom and thereby lower the required computing time, two simplifications
are made (Figure 2). A caged phosphite ligand
(i.e., 2,6,7-trioxa-1-phosphabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (L2)) is substituted for (BINOL)PN(Me)Ph (L1), the chiral
ligand used in experimental studies, and pinacolborane (pinBH, 6) is used in place of the unsymmetrical borane (tmdBH, 7) found to be preferable in the experimental work. The reaction
cycle is initiated by the active cationic catalytic species [Rh(L2)2S2]+, a tetracoordinate
square-planar complex, where L2 represents the caged-ligand
and S represents THF, the reaction solvent. We report the energetics
of all steps in the pathways leading to the γ-borylated product
(1R*,3S*)-262 and partially explore pathways leading to the
β-borylated product 3.

Figure 2 The model reaction is
illustrated with the optimized geometries
of reactants, catalyst, and major and minor products. (Note: Most
H atoms, except for the polar and reactive ones, are hidden for clarity.).

Computational Details
The reactants,
products, intermediates (Im), and transition-state
(TS) geometries in the model reaction were optimized
using the DFT/B3LYP58,59 method implemented in the Gaussian
09 package.60 Gradient optimizations were
carried out using the 6-31+G** basis set for C, O, P, B, N, and H
and LANL2DZ for Rh atoms. The stationary frequency calculations at
298.15 K and 1 atm were performed at the same level for each of the
optimized structures to examine any imaginary frequency or the corresponding
vibrational modes to obtain the thermal correction to Gibbs free energy.
The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations for each TS structure
were performed to illustrate the energy landscapes leading to the
TS geometry from the two neighboring minima corresponding to the species
before and after the respective steps. The single-point energies of
all the species in this reaction were calculated using 6-311+G** basis
set for C, O, P, B, N, and H and ECP28MWB for Rh atoms and the PCM
model for the tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent, all implemented in Gaussian
09.

We evaluated the free-energy changes at 298.15 K in two
different
ways. In the first way, we computed the free-energy changes according
to formula 1(61) in
which Gcorrect represents the thermal
correction to Gibbs free energy in the gas phase and Esolvent is the single-point energy of the same molecule
in THF solvent with a larger basis set. In this way the translational,
rotational, and vibrational contributions in gas phase were all taken
into account in the estimation of the free energy. With this correction,
we find that the relative energy does not differ markedly from that
before the correction for those elementary steps involving neither
the formation of adduct nor the release of product. However, very
significant relative energy differences were observed in those elementary
processes that involve either the formation of adduct or the release
of product (see the Supporting Information, Table S1). For the reaction in the gas phase, this may be reasonable
due to the significant entropy contribution (G = H – TS). However, it seems that, when in solution,
the entropy contribution is overestimated for the steps that involve
either the formation of adduct or the release of product, because
the released molecules encounter limited space for translational motion
within in the solvent cage.63,64 The overestimated entropy
contribution should mainly come from the translational entropy. Therefore,
we approached the problem in a second way; we deducted the translational
entropy and evaluated the free-energy change according to formula 2. Note that the second method underestimates the
entropy effects because translation movements are not completely suppressed
in solution. However, we believe that excluding the translational
entropy should make calculated results closer to experiment, and consequently,
the ensuing discussion of mechanism will be based on the results obtained
from this second method. 1   2  

Results and Discussions
1 General Considerations
We studied the
model reaction shown in Figure 2 while invoking
two-point binding of the substrate. A series of possible reaction
cycles (i.e., pathways I, II, and III, Figure 3) were considered in our
calculations. The first step, common in all of the pathways considered,
is complexation of the alkene substrate (i.e., N-phenylcyclopent-3-enecarboxamide
(1)) to the model active catalyst [Rh(L2)2S2]+. Note that each intermediate
and transition state considered in our calculations is labeled Im or TS, respectively, followed by an identifying
compound number. Oxidative addition of pinacolborane (pinBH, 6) affords the first intermediate rhodium complex, Im1. Reaction proceeds via migratory insertion of the alkene bond into
the Rh–H or Rh–B bond with subsequent reductive elimination
to form the B–C or C–H bond, respectively. In Figure 3, the cycle proceeding via migratory insertion into
the Rh–H bond and leading to the major γ-borylated product
(1R*,3S*)-2 is labeled
pathway I; the cycle proceeding via migratory insertion
into the Rh–B bond and leading to isomeric γ-borylated
product (1S*,3R*)-2 is labeled pathway II.

Figure 3 Three possible reaction
cycles with variants evaluated for the
proposed two-point substrate binding mechanism. (The hydrogen atoms
highlighted in red indicate incorporation from pinB–H.).

Two other pathways, labeled pathways I-1 and I-2, differ from pathway I in the details associated
with the reductive elimination step but afford the same γ-borylated
product as pathway I. We also considered potential competing
pathways leading to the isomeric β-borylated product 3, as outlined in pathway III. The relative free energies
for all the species considered in various pathways of the model reaction
are given in Table 1. In each case, the free
energies for intermediates and transition states (kcal/mol) are relative
to the total free energies of reactants (i.e., the catalyst [Rh(L2)2S2]+ + substrate + pinBH).

2 Pathway I: Migratory Insertion
into the Rh–H Bond
According to the proposed two-point
binding mechanism, the substrate first chelates to [Rh(L2)2S2]+ by displacing two solvent
molecules to form the complex labeled Im0. As shown in
Figure 4, Im0 is a square-planar
tetracoordinate rhodium(I) complex with Cs symmetry. The borane, pinBH, can add to Im0 from above or below the plane containing the metal leading to enantiomeric
products. Although the experimental studies directed toward CAHB use
chiral ligands, the model reaction incorporates achiral phosphite
ligands. Therefore, in contrast to the experimental studies, for which
the two oxidative addition approach pathways are diastereomeric, the
above and below plane pathways in the model reaction are enantiomeric
and equivalent in energy. Consequently, enantioselectivity is not
directly relevant to the model reaction, and we only calculate pinBH
attack from above the plane in pathway I (Figure 4) leading to the formation of (1R*,3S*)-2.

Figure 4 Optimized structures
for pathway I.

Oxidative addition of pinBH proceeds via calculated transition
state TS1; its structure and geometric parameters are
listed in Table 2. It can be noted that, in
the transition state, pinBH is positioned almost parallel to the plane
containing Rh placing the H atom directly on top of the metal. The
caged ligand labeled P2 is then displaced downward with respect to
the plane, ending at pseudoaxial position. The Rh—B and Rh—H
bond lengths are 2.368 and 1.831 Å, respectively. The calculated
free energy of activation for the formation of TS1 is
15.9 kcal/mol. The intermediate formed via oxidative addition of pinBH
to Im0 is the hexacoordinate octahedral complex Im1, which is calculated to lie approximately 3.9 kcal/mol
higher in energy than the Im0. The Rh—H bond in Im1 is oriented parallel to the Cγ=Cδ double bond of alkene substrate, and the latter remains
coordinated to the metal.

From the geometry calculated for Im1, migration of
the H atom from rhodium to Cδ is facile via transition
state TS2.65 The calculated
free energy barrier for migratory insertion of the alkene into the
Rh—H bond is approximately 1.2 kcal/mol, substantially lower
than that required for the first step. Intermediate Im2 is about 3.2 kcal/mol more stable than its precursor, Im1. As shown in Figure 4 and in Tables 2 and 3, Im2 is
a distorted octahedral complex; the bond angle of Cγ—Rh—P1 is reduced sequentially from 176.78°
in Im1 to 168.01° in TS2 and finally
to 162.02° in Im2. Concomitant with formation of
the Rh—Cγ and Cδ—H
bonds, the Cγ=Cδ π
bond is broken to form a single bond. The Rh—Cγ, Cδ—H and Cγ—Cδ bond lengths in Im2 are found to be 2.103,
1.116, and 1.506 Å, respectively. The Rh—H bond is continually
elongated from that in Im1 (1.576 Å) through TS2 (1.612 Å) to Im2 (1.944 Å). Nonetheless,
the relatively short contact distance persisting in Im2 indicates a weak but significant agostic interaction remains between
Rh—HCδ.

The final step in the two-point
binding mechanism is reductive
elimination to form the pinB–Cγ bond. As shown
in Figure 4 and in Table 2, TS7 is the transition state for reductive elimination.
The weak Rh–HCδ agostic interaction is maintained
in TS7 while the interaction between B, Rh, and Cγ assumes a triangular pattern. A rather high free energy
barrier, 26.5 kcal/mol, is calculated for the formation of TS7. After reductive elimination, the tetracoordinate intermediate Im7 is formed, which, in turn, leads to the γ-borylated
product (1R*,3S*)-2 and regenerates the Rh-catalyst. As evident from the high barrier
of formation of TS7, it is difficult for the pinB group
to migrate directly to Cγ through TS7 while maintaining the agostic Rh–HCδ interaction.
We explored two other pathways (labeled I-1 and I-2), which may provide much lower energy pathways. Both pathways
proceed via breakage of the Rh–HCδ agostic
interaction and afford the γ-borylated product (1R*,3S*)-2, as shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Optimized structures for pathways I-1 and I-2.

In pathway I-1, we explored a pathway in which a molecule
of solvent (i.e., THF) is explicitly reintroduced into the mechanism.
THF adds to Im2, breaking the agostic interaction; the
barrier for the THF addition step is only 7.8 kcal/mol. The resulting
product, Im3, is a stable hexacoordinate octahedral complex,
in which the calculated distance between Rh and the O atom of THF
is 2.343 Å. Reductive elimination forms the pinB–C bond,
leading to release of the γ-borylated product. The calculated
migration transition state (TS4) shows one imaginary
vibrational mode in which the B atom clearly moves further away from
the metal atom and gets closer to Cγ atoms to form
the B–Cγ bond and break the Rh–B bond.
The activation energy barrier from Im3 to TS4 is relatively high (21.0 kcal/mol). Tetracoordinate intermediate Im4 would be generated in the process leading to release of
the γ-borylated product and regeneration of the catalyst.

An alternative pathway involving isomerization of Im2 is found to be more favorable than the two described above. In pathway I-2, the Rh-coordinated carbonyl group of the amide moiety
in Im2 rotates approximately 78° from an equatorial
to an axial position to form Im5; the O—Rh—B
angle is 173.2° in Im2, 132.52° in TS5, and 95.17° in Im5 (Table 3). The long Rh—H distance in Im5 (i.e., 3.057
Å) indicates that the Rh—HCδ agostic
interaction has been broken. The energy barrier for rotation to TS5 (7.7 kcal/mol) is roughly equal to that for adding THF
as proposed in pathway I-1. Although one agostic bond
is broken in Im5, a new agostic interaction is formed
with the β-hydrogen (Hβ) of the cyclic alkene;
the calculated Rh-to-Hβ distance is 2.600 Å.
Both the reactant (Im2) and product (Im5) possess a distorted octahedral geometry in which the metal–hydrogen
agostic interaction remains conserved; therefore, the resulting two
structures can be considered as simple pseudorotational isomers. Im5 undergoes pinB to Cγ reductive elimination
via the calculated transition state TS6 with an activation
barrier of 16.8 kcal/mol. The activation barrier of the B—C
reductive elimination is roughly 10 kcal/mol lower than that the corresponding
step in pathway I (i.e., TS7, 26.5 kcal/mol).
The major difference between the two transition states is the location
of the weak agostic interaction, which is trans to the migrating B
atom in TS6, whereas the C=O and Rh interaction
may exert a stronger trans effect on the migrating group in TS7. TS6 shows one imaginary vibrational mode
similar to TS4 and TS7 as described previously.
The tetracoordinate intermediate Im6 then leads to the
γ-borylated product with regeneration of the catalyst.

A comparison
of these three pathways (I, I-1, and I-2) and their respective free-energy profiles
is illustrated in Figure 6. We find that the
reductive elimination step should be the rate-determining step for
all three possibilities examined. In pathway I, the reductive
elimination occurs via a single transition state (TS7), whereas pathways I-1 and I-2 involve
two-step transformation via an intermediate (Im3 for I-1 and Im5 for I-2) and two transition
states (TS3, TS4 for I-1 and TS5, TS6 for I-2). The overall energy
barriers of the rate determining step for the three pathways, in decreasing
order, is as follows: pathway I-1 (28.41 kcal/mol) >
pathway I (26.54 kcal/mol) > pathway I-2 (18.99 kcal/mol), indicating that pathway I-2 is the
most favorable for formation of γ-borylated product (1R*,3S*)-2 in the model reaction.

3 Pathway II: Migratory Insertion
into the Rh–B Bond
A recurring question in the mechanism
of rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration is which migratory insertion pathway
is preferred, Rh–H or Rh–B; the latter often referred
to as the dehydrogenative borylation pathway.50,52,66−69 To address this question, we
examined pathway II, which differs from the family of
mechanisms described under pathway I in that pathway II involves the migratory insertion of the coordinated alkene
into the Rh–B bond.70−72 To accommodate the desired migratory
insertion, pinBH adds to Im0 in a direction more perpendicular
(rather than parallel, as previously examined) to the coordination
plane encompassing Rh (Figure 7). Therefore,
the intermediate obtained in the first step of pathway II, i.e., Im8, differs structurally from the previously
described Im1. In Im8, the Rh–B bond
occupies a position parallel to the alkene double bond while the Rh–H
bond resides in the equatorial plane perpendicular to the alkene.
The imaginary vibrational frequency of TS8 clearly shows
B–H bond breaking and Rh–B bond formation modes. The
activation free energy barrier leading to TS8 is calculated
to be 22.0 kcal/mol, approximately 6 kcal/mol higher than that found
for pathway I (see Figure 8).
The free energies listed in Table 1 indicate
the intermediate Im8 is less stable (by about 3.5 kcal/mol)
than Im1.

Figure 8 Comparison of the potential energy profiles
for pathways I, I-2, and II.

Step 2 of pathway II involves the key migratory insertion
of the alkene into the Rh–B bonding, leading to formation of
the B–Cδ bond. We find that this step encounters
a free-energy barrier of approximately 7 kcal/mol, whereas the analogous
transition in pathway I (alkene insertion into the Rh–H
bond) is almost barrierless. In addition, the resulting intermediate Im9 is roughly 4.6 kcal/mol less stable than the previously
described intermediate Im2. Structurally, Im9 still maintains an octahedral core around the Rh as an O atom of
the pinacol moiety now coordinates to Rh.73 Reductive elimination forms the H–Cγ bond
and the square planar intermediate Im10 which again eventually
affords the γ-borylated product (1S*,3R*)-2. This reductive elimination step has
a calculated free energy of activation of approximately 20 kcal/mol,
making it not only the highest overall energy barrier in pathway II but higher than the highest overall barrier calculated
for pathway I-2.74

It
is worth noting at this point that oxidative addition of pinBH
from above the plane of Im0 (i.e., the same mode of addition
described above), the Rh–H migratory insertion pathways I, I-1, and I-2 lead to the stereoisomer
of the γ-borylated product designated (1R*,3S*)-2 whereas the Rh–B insertion pathway II leads to the enantiomeric structure designated (1S*,3R*)-2. As noted above,
the top- and bottom-face approaches are enantiotopic in the model
reaction, where achiral phosphite ligands are employed, and therefore
must be energetically equivalent. However, the enantiodivergent Rh–H
and Rh–B insertion pathways are of significance when chiral
ligands are employed rendering the approaches are diastereotopic.
In that context, it is significant to learn that the Rh–H migratory
insertion pathway I-2 is favored.75

4 Potential Competing Pathway
Leading to the Minor
β-Borylated Product 3
As summarized in
Figure 1, we find, experimentally, that a small
amount of the β-borylated compound 3 is generated
as byproduct; its exact amount varies as a function of the exact nature
of the catalyst and reaction conditions. In addition, experimental
observations suggest that the cyclic β,γ-unsaturated amide 8, an isomer of the cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated amide
substrate 1, is also transiently present in the reaction
mixture (Figure 9). We reasoned that the β-borylated
product 3 could be formed via rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration
of the β,γ-unsaturated amide 8, the latter
obtained by rhodium-catalyzed isomerization of the γ,δ-isomer 1. Two possible isomerization pathways providing a route to
the β-borylated product (i.e., pathways III-1 and III-2) were identified in our computational study. Figure 10 shows the structures for all the intermediates,
transition states, and the β,γ-unsaturated amide 8 in these potentially competitive pathways.

Figure 9 β- and γ-Borylated
product formation starting with
the β,γ-unsaturated amide. (Hydrogen atoms highlighted
in red indicate expected incorporation from pinB–H.).

Figure 10 Optimized structures involved in competing
reaction pathways III-1 and III-2.

Figure 5 shows that the Rh, Cγ, Cβ, and
Hβ atoms in intermediate Im5 all reside
approximately in the same plane as required
for β-hydride elimination; however, the calculated distance
between Rh and Hβ is too long (2.600 Å) for
facile β-hydride elimination to proceed directly from Im5. In our calculations, we find a more favorable mode coupled
with breaking the Rh—O interaction and leading to TS11 (pathway III-1). It shows an imaginary vibrational
mode involving moving the C=O moiety away from Rh while simultaneously
moving Cβ and Hβ up and closer to
Rh. As shown in Tables 2–4, the Rh—O distance is 2.180 Å in Im5, 3.426 Å in TS11, and 4.096 Å in Im11, respectively. The agostic interaction, Rh—HβCβ in Im11, is very similar to that
observed in Im2 (Rh—Hβ distance
is 2.018 Å; Cβ—Hβ distance
is 1.163 Å). Cγ, Cβ, Hβ, and Rh remain nearly on the same plane in Im11. β-Hydride elimination occurs to form the double bond between
Cγ and Cβ (see TS12 and Im12 in Figure 10). It should
be noted that Im11 can also lead directly to the γ-borylated
product 2 via a higher energy pathway TS15 (activation barrier of 17.4 kcal/mol).

We considered
another possible pathway (III-2) for
the competing reaction based on intermediate Im2 involving
Rh–Cγ bond rotation with TS13 as the rotation transition state. As listed in Table 4, the bond angle Cγ–Rh–P1 is 164.57° in Im2, 134.88° in TS13, and 93.10° in Im13, respectively.
Rh and HβCβ are brought into close
proximity by the Rh–Cγ bond rotation forming
a Rh–HβCβ agostic interaction
trans to a phosphite ligand (i.e., P1) as seen in intermediate Im13; the calculated agostic interaction is similar to that
found in other intermediates (Rh–Hβ distance
is 2.109 Å; Cβ–Hβ distance
is 1.135 Å). β-Hydride elimination leads to the coordinated
β,γ-unsaturated intermediate Im14 (Figure 10).

Figure 11 shows
a comparison of the free-energy
profiles for III-1 and III-2, and geometric
parameters for the calculated intermediates and transitions states
are summarized in Table 4. Pathway III-1 is the more favorable pathway to the β,γ-unsaturated
intermediate 8 and ultimately the minor β-borylated
product 3. The calculated barrier to Rh–Cγ bond rotation in pathway III-2 is approximately
17.9 kcal/mol higher in energy than breaking the Rh–O interaction
in pathway III-1 (Figure 11).
The activation barrier from Im5 to TS11 is
even slightly lower than that of the reductive elimination step of
pathway I-2 (i.e., Im5 to TS6), and the barrier to β-hydride elimination (i.e., Im11 to TS12, the reverse reaction of Rh–H migratory
insertion) is also very low.

Figure 11 Comparison of the potential energy profiles
for pathways III-1 and III-2.

Pathway III-1 is very competitive
to pathway I-2 in this model reaction, perhaps accounting
for the observed
formation of byproduct 3 in the experimental studies.
Although the requisite calculations have not been carried out as part
of this study, once formed, the β,γ-unsaturated intermediate 8 can in principle undergo rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration
to form either of the regioisomeric β- or γ-borylated
products (Figure 9); the ratio is expected
to vary as a function of the precise reaction conditions, especially
the nature of the ligand and borane employed. In support of this conjecture,
we find that under conditions similar to those described in Figure 1, an independently prepared β,γ-unsaturated
substrate 8 gave a mixture of β-borylated (20%)
and γ-borylated (51%) products.

Conclusions
Using
density functional theory calculations, we studied the mechanism
of the rhodium-catalyzed hydroboration of a cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated
amide 1 using a cationic rhodium(I) complex featuring
two-point binding of the substrate. Our computational studies assume
that norbornadiene (nbd), which accompanies the rhodium catalyst precursor
used in the experimental work that motivated this study, is not involved
in the active catalyst.76,77 The main characteristics
of the two-point binding mechanism are as follows. (1) The substrate
has two coordinating groups, the alkene and amide carbonyl oxygen,
that can chelate the substrate to the cationic Rh(I) catalyst leading
to the predicted cis relative configuration for the major γ-borylated
product (1R*,3S*)-2. The computational results are supported by experimental results
obtained for the related directed CAHB of the same substrate leading
to cis-(1R,3S)-2 as the major product. (2) The overall catalytic cycle for
a model reaction using caged phosphite ligands leading to the major
γ-borylated product (1R*,3S*)-2 includes the following steps: (i) chelation of the
cyclic γ,δ-unsaturated amide substrate 1 to
the active catalytic species [Rh(L2)2S2]+, (ii) oxidative addition of pinBH to rhodium,
(iii) preferred migratory insertion of the coordinated alkene into
the Rh–H, rather than Rh–B, bond to form C–H
and Rh–C bonds, (iv) isomerization (amide rotation) of the
resulting intermediate, and (v) reductive elimination to form the
B–C bond and regenerate the catalyst. (3) Of the potential
pathways to the β-borylated product considered, the amide rotation
pathway (pathway I-2) is calculated to be the most favorable.
(4) The amide rotation can, however, also divert to an accessible
β-hydride elimination pathway accounting for the competing formation
of some β-borylated product 3. (5) Finally, compared
to previously explored one-point binding mechanisms for rhodium-catalyzed
hydroborations, the two-point binding mechanism can better rationalize
experiment observations for the desymmetrization reactions of cyclic
γ,δ-unsaturated amides and the enantioselective reactions
of acyclic di- and trisubstituted β,γ-unsaturated amides
via CAHB.

Preliminary attempts to calculate transitions
states for alkene insertion into the more distal basal, rather than
the proximal apical, Rh–H (or Rh–B) bond were unsuccessful
and suggest that the pathway is significantly higher in energy.

We looked for experimental evidence for the
dehydrogenative borylation pathway, specifically formation of the
expected allylic alcohol (and the potential vinylborane-derived ketone),
and found no evidence for their formation.


Although racemic tmdBH is used in the CAHB
shown in Figure 1, it has been found in prior
studies that the chirality of tmdBH is inconsequential to the stereochemistry
of reaction; see ref (45).


In support of this assumption,
we find that
(1) norbornene is a substrate for hydroboration by the catalyst used
experimentally, and (2) the experimental results are essentially unchanged
using the corresponding Rh(cod)2BF4 catalyst
precursor.


In contrast, it can
be noted that coordinated cyclooctadiene resists iridium-catalyzed
hydroboration by catecholborane; see: Nguyen P. ; Blom H. P. ; Westcott S. A. ; Taylor N. J. ; Marder T. B.
