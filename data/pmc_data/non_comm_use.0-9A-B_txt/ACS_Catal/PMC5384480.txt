Transients in the
composition of Ni@NiOx core–shell
co-catalysts deposited on SrTiO3 are
discussed on the basis of state-of-the-art continuous analysis of
photocatalytic water splitting, and post-XPS and TEM analyses. The
formation of excessive hydrogen (H2:O2 ≫
2) in the initial stages of illumination demonstrates oxidation of
Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH (nickel oxyhydroxide), with the latter
catalyzing water oxidation. A disproportionation reaction of Ni and
NiOOH, yielding Ni(OH)2 with residual embedded Ni, occurs
when illumination is discontinued, which explains repetitive transients
in (excess) hydrogen and oxygen formation when illumination is reinitiated.

==== Body
Research on photocatalysis for
water splitting in slurry phase reactors, yielding hydrogen and oxygen,
has focused on (i) doping, creating optimized semiconductors for conversion
of sunlight into excited states (holes and electrons), and (ii) functionalizing
(doped) semiconductor crystals with so-called co-catalyst nanoparticles
to enhance the reaction rates of the necessary surface redox reactions
(proton reduction and water oxidation).1 One such co-catalyst system that has attracted significant attention
is a composite of Ni@NiOx particles. However,
the structure, mode of operation, and stability of the active Ni@NiOx particles is yet unresolved, and each appears
to be dependent on the composition and structure of the semiconductor.2−7For strontium titanate (SrTiO3), which is a semiconductor
capable of inducing both half-reactions of overall water splitting,
Domen et al.2 proposed that Ni@NiOx core–shell particles provide the
catalytic sites for hydrogen evolution. In their proposal, water oxidation
is catalyzed by the SrTiO3 surface. More recently, Osterloh
et al.7 suggested that the core–shell
model is not representing the active phase(s), but rather segregated
particles of Ni and NiOx, which promote
the formation of hydrogen and oxygen, respectively.

Both Domen
et al.2 and Osterloh et al.7 used batch reactors to evaluate catalytic performance,2,7 which complicates evaluation of transients in hydrogen and oxygen
evolution during the initial phase of water splitting. Recently, Crozier
et al. reported continuous flow experiments on the use of Ni@NiOx core–shell particles to promote activity
of TiO2 or Ta2O5 in overall water
splitting.5,6 During these experiments, oxygen could not
be detected and a decreasing trend in hydrogen production rate was
observed, which the authors explain based on the HRTEM images by oxidation
and subsequent dissolution of Ni out of the Ni@NiOx core–shell particles. Hollow NiOx shells were observed, while Ni dissolution was substantiated
by ICP analysis of the solution.5 Besides
the work of Crozier,5,6 there has been little research
into the transient behavior of functionalized semiconductors in (the
initial hours of) photocatalytic activity.8 Furthermore, transients occurring when the slurry is maintained
in dark conditions (catalyst regeneration9), to the best of our knowledge, have never been addressed for Ni@NiOx core–shell particles.

In this
study, we describe the use of a continuously stirred tank
reactor (CSTR) connected to a micro gas chromatograph equipped with
a pulsed discharge detector (PDD), providing unprecedented sensitivity
and data density, to analyze the transient behavior of Ni@NiO core–shell
particles deposited on SrTiO3 in the initial stages of
water splitting, after preparation and conditioning in the darkness.
We reveal significant transients in the hydrogen production rate,
which correlate to changes in the composition and structure of the
Ni@NiOx core–shell particles. The
implications of these transients for determination of the active phase
of Ni@NiOx core–shell particles
on SrTiO3, as well as the consequences for structural design,
allowing practical application, are discussed.

SrTiO3 was prepared according to previous reports (see
the Supporting Information). As expected,
X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) revealed that well-crystallized, phase-pure SrTiO3 particles with an ideal cubic perovskite structure were obtained
(Figures S1–S3 in the Supporting
Information). Additional diffraction lines at 2θ values of 36.3°
and 44.5°, characteristic for Ni and NiOx (Figure S1), confirm the loading
of well-distributed Ni@NiOx core–shell
particles, as observed in the SEM images of Figure S3.

The activity of the Ni@NiOx-SrTiO3 (BSTO-1000-NiOx) composite material
was tested in overall water splitting under solar light illumination
(see the Supporting Information) and the
rates of H2 and O2 evolution were measured as
a function of time (see Figure 1; Figure S4 in the Supporting Information
shows integrated H2 and O2 yields).

Figure 1 Transient behavior
in H2 and O2 evolution
during photocatalytic water splitting of 25 mg of BSTO-1000-NiOx (black trace, hydrogen; red trace, oxygen).
The light gray and purple areas represent the errors obtained from
the standard deviation.

Immediately after starting irradiation, significant H2 and O2 production was observed and a maximum H2 evolution rate of 0.3 μmol min–1 g–1 was obtained after 15 min. Both H2 and
O2 production
rate decline after reaching the maximum, with the O2 production
rate declining significantly faster and approaching apparent steady-state
conditions. Based on volume and gas-flow rate, CSTR behavior would
induce a fast increase in detected products,8 whereas the slow transient behavior observed here points toward
a composite material that degrades or dynamically changes during photocatalytic
testing. Interestingly, significant deviation from the stoichiometric
H2:O2 ratio of 2:1 was detected. Immediately
after switching-off the light, both H2 and O2 evolution rapidly discontinue, confirming that H2 and
O2 are formed in a photon-driven reaction.

To obtain
further insights into the transient behavior in the initial
phase of photocatalytic water splitting, variable times between illumination
and dark conditions were applied. The obtained results are shown in Figure 2. The initial transients
are in good agreement with the results presented in Figure 1. After purging of the reactor
with pure helium for 1 h in dark conditions, a new maximum (72% of
the initial maximum) in activity of H2 evolution was obtained,
when illumination was reinitiated. Consecutive dark–light cycles
show that the initial H2 evolution rate is dependent on
the duration of the dark treatment. After treatment in dark conditions
for 48 h, the initial H2 evolution rate can be fully recovered,
although the duration of the transient appears shorter than for the
fresh catalyst. The consecutive transient again shows that ∼73%
of the initial hydrogen activity can be recovered after 1 h in dark
conditions. The oxygen evolution rate is significantly larger after
keeping the reactor for 48 h in darkness (without reaching a maximum)
than that obtained for the fresh catalyst, and at the end of the final
transient, the catalyst is providing a H2:O2 ratio close to 2:1.

Figure 2 Transient behavior in H2 and O2 evolution
during photocatalytic water splitting of 25 mg of BSTO-1000-NiOx (black trace, hydrogen; red trace, oxygen).

This particular behavior clearly
points toward a dynamically changing
co-catalyst, which has not been previously reported for Ni@NiOx. SrTiO3 is not changing morphology
during the course of water splitting, as corroborated by HRSEM and
XRD analysis after testing (see Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

The Ni@NiOx co-catalyst was characterized
after different treatments in order to explain the observed transients.
The X-ray photoelectron spectra in the Ni region of the BSTO1000-NiOx catalyst before illumination, after illumination,
and after 48 h of treatment in darkness, are compared in Figure 3. For the as-prepared BSTO1000-NiOx composite, a complex Ni peak shape is observed, evidencing
that Ni is present in various oxidation states. Deconvolution of the
Ni 2p3/2 signal confirms the presence of metallic Ni0 (at 851.9 eV), Ni2+ (as in NiO at 853.5 eV), and
Ni2+ (as in Ni(OH)2 at 855.6 eV).10−12 The derived relative percentages of Ni metal and Ni oxide, as well
as the overall atomic Ni content, are shown in Table 1.

After illumination, the deconvolution of the Ni 2p3/2 region suggests that Ni is predominantly present in two
different
oxidation states, namely, Ni0 and Ni2+ (as in
Ni(OH)2 at 855.6 eV). A contribution of Ni2+ in a NiO environment appears less likely, as the width and the symmetry
of the Ni signal has clearly changed, compared to the as-prepared
composite material. Moreover, it is known from studies on electrochemical
oxygen evolution that NiO is not a stable phase.13,14 These studies, and thermodynamics (see the Pourbaix diagram shown
in Figure S7 in the Supporting Information),
suggest that, in addition to Ni(OH)2, the formation of
NiOOH is feasible upon illumination.7,15 Thus, we propose
the XPS signature at higher binding energies can be assigned to a
mixture of Ni(OH)2 and NiOOH. Finally, the Ni atomic concentration
at the surface of Ni@NiOx/STO (meas.)
decreases from 38.8 at. % to 21.7 at. %, whereas the Ni0:Ni2+/3+ ratio remains constant
at 0.2 (see Table 1). This apparently decreasing Ni content can be explained by (i)
leaching of Ni during illumination or (ii) significant particle growth.
Leaching can be discarded on the basis of the elemental analysis of
the solid and solution after the reaction (see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information). In addition,
the particle size distributions obtained from SEM before and after
the reaction suggest that the decrease in Ni atomic concentration
is due to particle growth (Figure S8 in
the Supporting Information).

After regeneration (Ar/dark), the
intensity of the Ni signal at
855.6 is recovered (36 at. %). In addition, the contribution
of metallic Ni0 (at 851.9 eV) to the Ni signal has almost
disappeared (Ni0/Ni2+/3+ = 0.06), pointing toward a dynamic restructuring in the darkness.
Given that the contribution of metallic Ni is significantly smaller
than for the sample immediately after reaction, a reaction of NiOOH
with metallic Ni (in the core) to form Ni(OH)2 in conditions
of darkness is proposed: 1  

Finally, when the regenerated
sample was illuminated again (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information), the
total Ni loading remained almost constant, pointing toward a stable
(size) configuration of the NiOx co-catalyst,
in agreement with the now close to 2:1 ratio of H2:O2, in the final measurement shown in Figure 2.

To further support the results obtained by XPS, HRTEM
was used
(see Figure 4, as well
as Figures S9 and S10 in the Supporting
Information). The Ni@NiOx particles in
as-prepared BSTO1000-NiOx(Figure 4a) clearly show the core–shell
structure (in sizes of ∼8–10 nm, with a metallic Ni
core of ∼6 nm), in agreement with previous reports and XPS
data.5 The corresponding d-spacing of the lattice fringes obtained from fast Fourier transformation
(FFT) indicate the presence of metallic Ni(111), and NiO(220). After
illumination, i.e., after the first transients shown in Figure 2, the structure maintains the
core–shell morphology. However, the metallic Ni core appears
smaller than in the fresh sample (Figure 4b), and the shell appears thicker and seems
to be composed of two separate phases. The d-spacing
values derived from the FFT analysis of a variety of Ni@NiOx particles (Figure 4b, all d-spacings are included in Table S3 in the Supporting Information), include
values of 6.7–7.7, 2.96, and 2.36 Å, which confirms the
presence of NiOOH.16 The additional d-spacings also indicate the presence of Ni (2.06 Å)
and NiO (2.41 Å). Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the
shell is composed of NiO with superpositioned NiOOH. The regenerated
sample shows different morphologies (Figure 4c). Besides residual core–shell structures,
a Ni(OH)2 phase with small spots of larger contrast embedded in the Ni(OH)2 layer is apparent, which, according to FFT analysis, likely consist
of metallic Ni (see Figure S9 in the Supporting
Information).

Figure 4 HRTEM images and corresponding FFT results of the (a,d)
as-prepared,
(b,e) illuminated, and (c,f) regenerated Ni@NiOx SrTiO3 composite material. The observed changes
in morphology and composition of the Ni@NiOx co-catalysts during overall water splitting are also schematically
indicated.

The structural changes as identified
by XPS and TEM analyses are
illustrated in Figure 4. In agreement with proposed structures by Domen et al.2 and Crozier et al.,5,6 the as-prepared
co-catalyst is composed of Ni@NiOx core–shell
particles.2,5,6 The NiO phase
is transformed by humidity and in aqueous conditions to nickel hydroxide
(Ni(OH)2):2 2  

TheseNi@Ni(OH)2 core–shell particles are
not
stable under the experimental conditions of illumination, and, very
likely, the Ni(OH)2 phase is oxidized by holes to NiOOH: 3  

In electrochemical water oxidation, this is
a well-documented process;
however, for Ni@NiOx core–shell
particles on SrTiO3, this reaction has not yet been considered.13,14 Nevertheless, this reaction might explain the substoichiometric
quantity of oxygen formed in the initial transients, and it is a sacrificial
reaction for the highly effective formation of hydrogen in these initial
stages.

Predominantly during regeneration, we propose that NiOOH
disproportionates
by reaction with the Ni core (reaction 1), to form Ni(OH)2, as previously discussed,
being in agreement with the observed differences in XPS spectra and
TEM images. Indeed, in electrochemical oxygen evolution, it is reported
that, at potentials below the onset for oxygen evolution (i.e., in
darkness), Ni is present as Ni(OH)2.14Reaction 1 is accompanied by vast structural rearrangement, yielding some remaining
Ni that is embedded in Ni(OH)2. (Re)illumination again
converts Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH (hence, the initial high hydrogen
production rate after a dark period), and dark treatment again converts
additional Ni, according to reaction 1. As a consequence of reactions 1 and 3, the metallic
Ni content decreases with time (see XPS) and, eventually, only metallic
Ni will be present in small quantities (Figure 4c), if any.

When in close proximity
to NiOOH, Ni initially is a sacrificial
electron donor (reaction 1). Our study implies that improved performance can be obtained if
Ni and Ni(OH)2 are deposited on separate facets of SrTiO3, reaction 3 remains
feasible, and reaction 1 is prevented. Osterloh et al.7 showed
that the presence of metallic Ni is indispensable for obtaining overall
water splitting (catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction), while
the required amount might be small, compared to the amount of NiOx species, because of very favorable hydrogen
evolution kinetics.17

The preparation
of well-defined SrTiO3 crystals providing
anisotropic facets was recently reported by Li et al.18 Those crystals might be suitable to further explore the
transient behavior of Ni@NiOxSrTiO3 composite photocatalysts, and the function of the Ni compounds
of various oxidation states.

In conclusion, it is proposed that
transients observed upon illumination
in hydrogen evolution rates, and corresponding morphological changes
of Ni@NiOx core–shell particles
investigated by TEM and XPS, can be explained by in situ formation of NiOOH upon illumination. The metallic Ni core serves
as a sacrificial agent in the water-splitting process, and during
regeneration. Certainly, long-term experiments and in situ studies are required to further explore the dynamic behavior of
Ni@NiOx core–shell co-catalysts.
