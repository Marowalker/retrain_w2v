A catalytic
asymmetric direct C–H arylation of (η6-arene)chromium
complexes to obtain planar-chiral compounds
is reported. The use of the hemilabile ligand H8-BINAP(O)
is key to providing high enantioselectivity in this transformation.
We show that this methodology opens the door to the synthesis of a
variety of planar-chiral chromium derivatives which can be easily
transformed into planar chiral mono- or diphosphines. Mechanistic
studies, including synthesis and characterization of Pd and Ag complexes
and their detection in the reaction mixture, suggest a Pd-catalyzed/Ag-promoted
catalytic system where Ag carries out the C–H activation step.

1 Introduction
Unsymmetrically
substituted metallocenes and (η6-arene)chromium complexes
are two notable families of planar-chiral
transition-metal organometallic complexes, and they have extensively
been applied as stoichiometric auxiliaries and/or starting materials
for asymmetric synthesis of biologically interesting substances.1,2 Derivatives of ferrocene have been extensively investigated as optically
active ligands in catalysis.3 In contrast,
the use of (arene)chromium complexes as chiral ligands has been significantly
less explored with only a small selection of such ligands reported
to date (Figure 1).
In spite of this, a variety of (arene)Cr(CO)3-based chiral
ligands have been successfully used in asymmetric C–C bond
formation reactions, such as cross-coupling reactions,4 addition of dialkylzinc to benzaldehyde,5 1,4-additions to Michael acceptors,5,6 hydrovinylations,7 1,2-additions of phenylboroxines to imines6 and nucleophilic substitutions.6b,8 Such ligands have also been employed in asymmetric reductions,8b,9 hydroaminations,8b hydroborations,10 and hydrosilylations.11

Formation of optically active (arene)chromium species
is usually
accomplished by means of either resolution of racemates,12 or asymmetric synthesis via diastereoselective
complexation,13 diastereo- or enantioselective
deprotonation/electrophile quenching,14 and nucleophilic addition/hydride abstraction sequences15 (Scheme 1a–c). All these methods employ stoichiometric chiral
reagents or auxiliaries. Additionally, many of these processes are
hampered by the use of sensitive organometallic reagents, poor functional
group compatibility, and/or low atom economy. Conversely, the more
attractive access to nonracemic (arene)chromium complexes via asymmetric
catalysis has been significantly less explored. Uemura first reported
the desymmetrization of o-dichlorobenzene chromium
tricarbonyl complexes via asymmetric Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling with
various vinylic metals.16 Subsequently,
several examples of desymmetrization of suitably difunctionalized
(arene)chromium complexes have been reported, including methoxycarbonylation17 or hydrogenolysis of haloarene-chromium derivatives,18 intramolecular Mizoroki-Heck reactions,19 gold-catalyzed intramolecular nucleophilic additions20 and Mo-catalyzed kinetic resolution6a (Scheme 1d). In all of these cases, prefunctionalization of the η6-complexed arene is required. In contrast, a catalytic asymmetric
approach to planar-chiral (arene)chromium complexes from nonprefunctionalized
starting materials has never been reported (Scheme 1e).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Planar-Chiral (Arene)Cr(CO)3 Complexes
While transition-metal catalyzed asymmetric C–H
functionalization
faces the challenge of discriminating between “inert”
enantiotopic C–H bonds, it provides a straightforward approach
for the preparation of chiral molecules.21 Several strategies have been developed to introduce central- and
axial-chirality by enantioselective C–H bond activation.22 However, the use of asymmetric C–H bond
functionalization for the creation of planar chirality has been relatively
underexplored and limited exclusively to ferrocenes.23 These methods all rely on the formation of a chiral metallacyclic
intermediate via an intramolecularly directed C–H activation.24,25 Thus, they are limited to substrates with suitable directing groups,
reducing the generality and applicability of the process. To the best
of our knowledge, there are no methods reported to synthesize enantioenriched
planar-chiral chromium tricarbonyl complexes from unfunctionalized
precursors in a catalytic fashion. In this paper, we report the first
catalytic direct asymmetric C–H arylation of simple prochiral
(η6-fluoroarene)chromium complexes (Scheme 2). In addition, we demonstrate
that the enantioenriched products can be easily converted into planar-chiral
phosphines providing access to an array of novel (arene)chromium-based
chiral phosphine ligands.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization
of the Conditions of the Direct
Asymmetric C–H Arylation
We have recently demonstrated
that (fluoroarene)Cr(CO)3 complexes such as 1a can undergo Pd-catalyzed/Ag-mediated direct arylation affording
excellent yields of ortho-substituted biaryls with
high regioselectivity.26 A combination
of stoichiometric and kinetic mechanistic studies showed that PPh3 ligated Ag(I)-carboxylates are responsible for the C–H
activation step.27 With this in mind, we
envisaged that the process could be rendered asymmetric in the presence
of a chiral phosphine ligand suitable for distinguishing between the
two enantiotopic C–H bonds of a prochiral complex. Furthermore,
the presence of a C–F bond in the aromatic core should allow
for the subsequent easy transformation of the resulting products into
chiral arylphosphine derivatives via phosphination.28

We started our investigation testing similar conditions
to those reported for the (nonasymmetric) ortho-arylation
of (fluorobenzene)Cr(CO)3 (1a) complexes26a as a benchmark for reactivity. Under these
conditions good reactivity was observed with 41% of racemic monoarylated
product 3aa and 31% of bisarylated 4aa formed
(Table 1, entry 1).
We then replaced Pd(PPh3)4 with Pd(dba)2 and (S)-BINAP (L1), but under
these conditions no reactivity was observed (entry 2). We had previously
observed that the use of the highly hindered amine TMP (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine)
as an additive enhances the reactivity of η6-coordinated
arenes toward C–H arylation.29 Gratifyingly,
the use of this additive promoted the reaction, forming monoarylated
chromium complex 3aa in 28% yield and a low but promising
enantioselectivity (38:62 er) (entry 3). A screen
of Pd(II) sources revealed that Pd(CH3CN)4(BF4)2 gave similar yield to Pd(dba)2 with
a slightly higher enantiomeric ratio (entry 4). Given that the carboxylic
acid is involved in the C–H activation step, we expected the
enantioselectivity of the process to be heavily influenced by the
nature of the carboxylate. Indeed, carboxylic acid screening showed
that dicyclohexylacetic acid enhanced both the reactivity and, importantly,
the enantioselectivity (er: 18:82–16:84, entries
5 and 6). Conversely, reaction in the absence of the carboxylic acid
gave a low yield of arylation and the enantiomeric ratio dropped to
55:45 (entry 7). Reactivity was completely shut down in the absence
of silver carbonate (entry 8), whereas in the absence of K2CO3 a slightly lower yield and enantioselectivity were
obtained (entry 9).30 Unreacted starting
material was observed in all reactions. In some cases, free arene(s)
was detected due to decomplexation of starting material and/or product
and/or bisarylated byproduct.

We then set out to explore
a variety of chiral ligands (Table 2). In comparison with
BINAP (L1), the more sterically hindered 3,5-xylyl-BINAP
(L2) gave a similar arylation yield but significantly
lower enantioselectivity (Table 2, entries 1 and 2). On exploring the effect of the
bite angle, we found that SegPhos (L3), with its smaller
bite angle than L1, decreased the enantiomeric ratio
while keeping similar reactivity; DIOP (L4), which has
a larger bite angle than L1, also gave very low enantioselectivity
(entries 3 and 4), suggesting that bite angles similar to that of L1 were ideal for this transformation. Good conversion but
low er was observed when the monophosphine MeO-MOP
(L5) was used (entry 5). Phosphoramidite MonoPhos (L6) and the P,N-ligand PPFA (L7) both completely
inhibited the reaction (entries 6 and 7), while H8-BINAP
(L8) led to similar reactivity to its unsaturated counterpart
BINAP (L1) but with slightly higher er (entry 8). Finally, we tested BINAP(O) (L9), a ligand
that has been rarely used in asymmetric catalysis,31 which contains both a strong and a weak donor atom, providing
it the ability to act as a di- or monodentate ligand. Interestingly,
in the presence of this hemilabile ligand, the yield and enantioselectivity
of the process increased up to 47% and 14:86 er,
respectively (entry 9).

2.2 Synthesis and Reactivity of H8-BINAP(O)
and H8-BINAP Derivatives
As the best results of
reactivity and selectivity were found when H8-BINAP (L8) and BINAP(O) (L9) were used as chiral ligands,
we decided to synthesize H8-BINAP(O) and other partially
hydrogenated BINAP variants to test them as chiral ligands in the
C–H asymmetric arylation of chromium complexes.

(R)-(2′-(Diphenylphosphanyl)-5,5′,6,6′,7,7′,8,8′-octahydro-[1,1′-binaphthalen]-2-yl)diphenylphosphine
oxide ((R)-H8-BINAP(O), (R)-L10)32 was prepared in
four steps following a methodology similar to that used for the synthesis
of its unsaturated analogue BINAP(O) (Scheme 3).33 The preparation
of (R)-L10 from commercially available
(R)-H8-BINOL was accomplished by sequential
substitution of the homotopic triflate groups of (R)-5 by diphenylphosphine oxide.34,35 The absolute configuration of the final product (R)-L10 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis (Scheme 3). With the aim of
investigating the influence on the modification of electronic and
steric properties of the H8-BINAP(O) ligand on the reactivity
and enantioselectivity of the reaction, we synthesized a range of
H8-BINAP derivatives (L11–L18) following similar experimental procedures to those reported for
their BINAP analogues (see Supporting Information).36

Ligand (R)-L10
All hydrogen atoms are omitted
for clarity.

Gratifyingly, when H8-BINAP(O) (L10) was
tested as the ligand, high reactivity and enantioselectivity were
observed for the arylation of 1a (Table 3, entry 1). We then tested ligands in which
the weaker donor atom of the mono-oxidized H8-BINAP(O)
was substituted by different functional groups. When the chiral ligand
contained an ester group (L11) reactivity decreased while
the product obtained was almost racemic (entry 2). A similar result
was observed with a ligand bearing an alcohol substituent (L12) (entry 3). Interestingly, the more coordinating amide-derivative
(L13) yielded 37% of product 3aa with a
moderate 27:73 er (entry 4). These results demonstrate
that the oxidized phosphine is essential to achieve high enantioselectivity.
To evaluate the influence of the phosphine fragment, we tested the
bis-oxidized H8-BINAP ligand (L14). This led
to a racemic product in similar yield to that obtained in the absence
of chiral ligand (29% of 3aa and 12% of 4aa), indicating that the phosphine moiety is necessary for coordination
to the metal center. Once we had established that the combination
of phosphine–phosphine oxide is the most adequate for achieving
high reactivity and enantioselectivity, we decided to investigate
the influence of the substituents in both of these groups. A ligand
containing the P(O)(4-methoxyphenyl)2 fragment (L15) gave analogous results to H8-BINAP(O) ligand (L10) in terms of both reactivity and er (entry
6). However, when the phenyl groups were replaced by 3,5-dimethylphenyl
groups (L16), both reactivity and enantioselectivity
decreased (entry 7). The same scenario, but with even lower er, was observed when the aryl groups of the oxidized phosphine
were replaced by alkylic cyclopentyl fragments (L17)
(entry 8). Finally, replacing the phenyl groups in the PPh2 fragment with the more electron-donating 4-methoxyphenyl substituents
(L18), led to only a moderate enantiomeric ratio (entry
9).

2.3 Enantioselective C–H Activation of
(η6-Fluoroarene)Cr(CO)3 Complexes
With the optimized conditions for the asymmetric arylation reaction,
we set out to explore the generality of the methodology with respect
to the fluoroarene chromium complex (Scheme 4a). Unsubstituted fluoroarene chromium derivatives
showed good reactivity and er (3aa,ab). The presence of a methyl substituent on the fluoroarene
did not produce a significant difference in terms of yield or enantiomeric
ratio (3bb); however, when the substituent was an ester
or a methoxy group a slight decrease in the enantiomeric ratio was
observed (3cb,db). Interestingly, when the
fluoroarene core contains a masked aldehyde in the form of a 1,3-dioxane
group, the enantioenriched product was obtained in a 97:3 enantiomeric
ratio (3eb). Different protecting groups for the aldehyde
gave similar results of yield and enantioselectivity to 1,3-dioxane
(3fb,gb,fc). The absolute configuration
of the planar-chiral products could be unambiguously confirmed by
X-ray diffraction analysis of a monocrystal of enantioenriched 3aa, showing that when (R)-L10 is used as a chiral ligand, the major isomer obtained is (Sp)-3aa (Figure 2)

enantiomer of 3aa, obtained

Then, we turned our attention to the effect of substitution
at
the iodoarene coupling partner (Scheme 4b). A variety of functional groups at the para- and meta-positions of iodoarenes, including electron-donating
and electron-withdrawing substituents, were tolerated, affording the
corresponding chiral biaryl chromium complexes 3 in moderate
yield and high enantioselectivities. The reaction is compatible with
carbonyl functionalities such as ester, ketone, and aldehydes (3ea,ek,el). Nitrogen-containing
substituents, such as nitro (3ed) and cyano (3ec), can be present on the iodoarene. The reaction is also compatible
with Br and Cl substituents (3eg,em), which
would allow for further functionalization via cross-couplings, CF3 substituents (3ef) and 3,5-disubstituted iodoarenes
(3eo). For p-substituted iodoarenes,
higher er values are obtained with electron-poor
arenes (3ea–3eg) than with electron-rich
derivatives (3ei). However, similar enantioselectivities
were observed for m-substituted iodoarenes regardless
of their electronic properties (3ek–3en). On the other hand, ortho-substituted iodoarenes
showed low reactivity (3ap,aq).

Analysis
over time of the reaction of 1e with 2b shows
that at low conversions the product 3eb is formed in
92:8 er. However, the er increases
steadily throughout the reaction, in parallel to the formation
of bisarylation product 4eb, with er reaching 98:2 when 27% of bisarylated 4eb has been
formed (see SI). This suggests that the
observed er values in Scheme 4 are the result of an asymmetric C–H
arylation step compounded with a kinetic resolution of the product.

2.4 Mechanistic Studies
2.4.1 Role
of Ag(I) Salts in Asymmetric Arylation
of (Fluoroarene)Cr(CO)3 Complexes
Recent studies
by our group on Pd-catalyzed direct functionalization of aryl C–H
bonds in the presence of silver salts revealed that phosphine ligated
silver carboxylate can metalate the C–H bonds in arenes bound
to a Cr(CO)3 fragment;27 the
resulting arylsilver(I) complex is then proposed to transfer its aryl
moiety to a palladium intermediate. Similar conclusions were also
drawn by Sanford37 and Hartwig,38 in the case of thiophenes and (poly)fluoroarenes,
and we have recently exploited this activation mode to develop the
first direct α–arylation of benzo[b]thiophenes
and thiophenes at room temperature.39

As this reaction did not proceed in the absence of silver (Table 1, entry 8), we hypothesized
that in this case the silver salt would also be involved in the C–H
bond cleavage step. To test this hypothesis, we studied the H/D exchange
of 1e with 10 equiv of D2O in the presence
of different combinations of additives (Table 4). No deuteration was observed when 1e was submitted to the standard reaction conditions in the
absence of the silver salt (Table 4, entry 1). Deuterated complex d1-1e was not detected when the reaction was carried out only in the presence
of Ag2CO3 (entry 2), or in combination with
the chiral ligand L10 with or without the carboxylic
acid (entries 3–4). Importantly, in entries 2–4, the
silver salt was appreciably insoluble in toluene. On the other hand,
addition of TMP to Ag2CO3 led to formation of
32% of d1-1e (entry 5). This is consistent
with a higher solubility of the Ag-salt either through coordination
or increased solvent polarity. Addition of 5.5 mol % of L10 led to an increased H/D exchange of 54% (entry 6), consistent with
an enhanced rate of C–H activation of the Ag-L10 complex. Similarly enhanced H/D exchange was obtained when both L10 and the carboxylate were added in the presence of TMP
(entry 7). Interestingly, 1H and 31P NMR analysis
of the reaction mixture in entry 7 revealed the presence of a Ag-L10 complex. These results are consistent with a silver(I)-mediated
C–H activation step in operation under the present reaction
conditions that likely involves a coordinated L10 ligand.

Reaction of silver carboxylate 8 with 1 equiv of (R)-H8-BINAP(O)
((R)-L10) in CH2Cl2 at room temperature afforded the
phosphine-ligated Ag(I) carboxylate 9 in 96% yield (eq 1). Its structure was confirmed
by X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 3). 1H and 31P NMR analysis of 9 matched with those observed in the reaction mixture of Table 4, entry 7, confirming
the presence of the Ag-L10 complex.38,40 Furthermore, 31P NMR analysis of the reaction of 1e with 2i under our standard conditions, after
2 h (Figure 4a), clearly
showed resonances corresponding to the (R)-H8-BINAP(O)-ligated silver carboxylate 9, strongly
suggesting its participation in the catalytic cycle (Figure 4b). 1

Interestingly, another smaller
set of signals, presumably corresponding
to a PdL* compound, were present in the 31P NMR spectrum
of the reaction mixture (Figure 4a). We speculated that these could correspond to Pd-complexes 11 or 12 (Scheme 5). Complex 11 was synthesized via the
Buchwald-type palladium derivative 10,41 which underwent smooth oxidative addition with 4-iodoanisole
to give 11 (Scheme 5). The structure of 11 was confirmed by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 5). 12 was prepared from 11 by reaction with AgO2CCHCy2 (8). Comparison of the 31P NMR of both 11 and 12 with those observed in the analysis of the catalytic
reaction mixture, revealed that the small set of signals in the latter
corresponded to 12 (Figure 4c). This analysis highlights that the ligand L10 can coordinate to both Ag and Pd in the reaction. While
qualitative analysis suggests that the majority of L10 would be coordinated to Ag, it cannot be discarded that it also
plays a role in the reactivity of the Pd-species.

2.4.2 Proposed Catalytic Cycle
From the
experiments above and previous work in the field,27 we propose the bimetallic catalytic cycle outlined in Scheme 6 to be in operation.
In this mechanism, a Pd(0)-L10 complex A undergoes oxidative addition to B, which after transmetalation
affords arylcarboxylate-Pd derivative C, structurally
related to complex 12. In a parallel catalytic cycle,
silver carboxylate E carries out C–H activation
on η6-coordinated arene 1 to form arylsilver
intermediate F, presumably by a carboxylate assisted
CMD mechanism.37 Transmetalation from silver
intermediate F to the palladium-arylcarboxylate C(38) would form D,
which would in turn release the product 3 after reductive
elimination. We propose that L10 is coordinated to both
Ag and Pd, throughout the process. Two possible enantiodetermining
steps must thus be considered: an enantioselective C–H activation
by complex E, followed by a fast transmetalation with C, or alternatively a fast reversible C–H activation,
followed by a rate and enantioselectivity determining transmetalation.
However, further experiments will be necessary to understand this
process fully, which is further complicated by the low solubility
of some of the species in toluene.

2.5 Synthesis and Derivatization
of Enantioenriched
Planar-Chiral (Arene)Chromium Tricarbonyl Phosphines
The
presence of a C–F bond in the aromatic core of the chiral (arene)chromium
complexes allows easy functionalization via a variety of nucleophilic
aromatic substitutions,42 including phosphination
reactions, to obtain arylphosphine derivatives easily.

Nelson
and co-workers investigated the effectiveness of optically active
arylmonophosphine Cr-complexes as ligands in asymmetric catalysis
in the Pd(II)-catalyzed alkylation of allylic acetates under Trost’s
conditions,8b thus demonstrating that chromium-complexed
arylphosphines provide chiral equivalents of triarylphosphine ligands
that are ubiquitous in late transition-metal chemistry and catalysis.
To test the applicability of our approach for the synthesis of new
planar-chiral phosphines we carried out the asymmetric arylation of 1e with 4-iodobenzonitrile (2c) at 1 mmol scale
under the standard catalytic conditions. Enantioenriched product 3ec was obtained in 48% yield with 97:3 er. Reaction of 3ec with potassium diphenylphosphide resulted
in nucleophilic aromatic substitution to afford the chiral planar
triarylphosphine (Sp)-13 in
93% yield and 97:3 enantiomeric ratio. The structure and absolute
stereochemistry of 13 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction
analysis (Scheme 7a).

Synthesis of Novel Planar-Chiral Diphosphines
All hydrogen atoms omitted
for clarity.

The protected aldehyde on 13 provides an ideal handle
for further derivatization and tuning of electronic properties of
this chiral phosphine. Accordingly, treatment of 13 under
acidic conditions revealed the aldehyde to obtain 14,
which could then be reduced by NaBH4 to the alcohol derivative 15 (Scheme 7b). Both the aldehyde in 14 and the alcohol in 15 could then be easily transformed into a variety of functionalities.
Over the past few decades, chiral diphosphines have proven to be among
the most useful and versatile ligands for metal-catalyzed asymmetric
reactions and the design and preparation of such diphosphines remains
as active an area of research as ever.43 The synthesis of C2-symmetric diphosphine
ligands has long received the most attention, due perhaps to the relative
ease of obtaining these molecules.44 However,
studies have showed that C2 symmetry is
not a necessary condition for attaining high enantioselectivity in
catalysis.45 Our functionalized planar
chiral phosphines, such as 14 and 15, are
ideal starting points for the synthesis of novel classes of planar
chiral diphosphines. Reaction of the aldehyde derivative 14 with p-(diphenylphosphino)benzylamine in the presence
of a catalytic amount of acid afforded the diphosphine-imine derivative 16 in quantitative yield. This compound can be reduced by
benzyltriphenylphosphonium tetrahydroborate to give the corresponding
chiral amine-diphosphine derivative 17, providing a novel
class of bidentate chiral phosphines (Scheme 7b).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed the first protocol for catalytic
direct C–H asymmetric arylation of (η6-arene)chromiumtricarbonyl
complexes to afford enantioenriched planar-chiral products in one
step. The development of this methodology required the synthesis of
a new family of H8-BINAP derivatives, finding that H8-BINAP(O) was the most suitable chiral ligand for the reaction.
Optimized catalytic conditions were applied to a variety of iodoarenes
and (fluoroarene)Cr(CO)3 complexes affording the corresponding
chiral products in good yield and excellent enantioselectivity. Mechanistic
studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through a Pd/Ag bimetallic
double catalytic cycle where the C–H activation is carried
out by Ag. These enantioenriched aryl-complexes can be used for the
synthesis of chiral planar monodentate phosphines and a new class
of chiral planar bidentate phosphines. The application of these new
chiral ligands to asymmetric catalysis is currently under investigation.
