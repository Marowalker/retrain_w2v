The cysteine protease enzyme legumain hydrolyzes peptide bonds
with high specificity after asparagine and under more acidic conditions
after aspartic acid [Baker E. N.  J. Mol. Biol. 1980 , 141 , 441 −484 7003158 ; Baker E. N.  ; J. Mol.

legumain additionally exhibits ligase activity that prevails at pH
> 5.5. The atomic reaction mechanisms including their pH dependence
are only partly understood. Here we present a density functional theory
(DFT)-based quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) study of
the detailed reaction mechanism of both activities for human legumain
in solution. Contrasting the situation in other papain-like proteases,
our calculations reveal that the active site Cys189 must be present
in the protonated state for a productive nucleophilic attack and simultaneous
rupture of the scissile peptide bond, consistent with the experimental
pH profile of legumain-catalyzed cleavages. The resulting thioester
intermediate (INT1) is converted by water attack on the thioester
into a second intermediate, a diol (INT2), which is released by proton
abstraction by Cys189. Surprisingly, we found that ligation is not
the exact reverse of the proteolysis but can proceed via two distinct
routes. Whereas the transpeptidation route involves aminolysis of
the thioester (INT1), at pH 6 a cysteine-independent, histidine-assisted
ligation route was found. Given legumain’s important roles
in immunity, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases, our findings
open up possibilities for targeted drug design in these fields.

Introduction
The most common cysteine
proteases are papain, cathepsin, and caspases,
which can be found in a series of living organisms1−7 and play significant roles in proteolytic signaling. Therefore,
deficiency as well as uncontrolled activity of cysteine proteases
may cause many diseases such as cancer,8 muscular dystrophy,9 and Alzheimer’s
disease.10 The cysteine protease legumain
is overexpressed in several types of cancer and may be displaced from
the lysosomes to the cell surface during malignant progression. Because
the extracellular microenvironment in many tumors is acidic, it may
allow cysteine protease activity also outside of the lysosomes. Legumain11−16 has therefore been utilized for experimental pro-drug activation
ensuring tumor-targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs.17

Moreover, legumain has been proposed as
a marker for certain cancers
and a potential therapeutic agent.18−20 Besides, protease inhibitors
could also be employed as therapeutic targets (e.g., MMP inhibitors).
Because the most successful inhibitors are usually transition-state-like,
it is indispensable to fully understand the catalytic mechanism (intermediate
and transition states), protonation states, and electronic properties
in detail.

Proteases can also ligate peptide chains, generating
cyclic, new,
or alternatively spliced peptides. Especially in plants, cyclic peptides
(like cyclotides) and protein variants play important roles in biology21 and medicine.22 Moreover,
cyclic peptides find broad application in peptide drug engineering.23 However, in vitro cyclization of synthetic peptides
is limited by the availability of ligase/transpeptidase enzymes.24−27 Importantly, at more neutral pH, human28 and mouse legumain29 has been shown to
exhibit ligase activity.

Particularly for plant legumains, transpeptidation
was suggested
by Bernath-Levin et al.31 and Harries et
al.,25 who performed macrocyclization reaction
of SFTI and Kalata B1 in isotope-labeled H2O18 and found that when analyzing the proteolytic or ligated products
by mass spectrometry no incorporation of O18 was detectable
in the ligation product, which indicates that cyclization was achieved
by direct transpeptidation and not through hydrolysis followed by
ligation.

However, the exact mechanism of cleavage and ligation
is not known.
Therefore, within the scope of this project, we intend to investigate
the legumain-catalyzed amide cleavage and ligation procedure in atomistic
details using high-level (density functional theory (DFT)-based, quantum
mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)) computational methods. Cystein
proteases can be divided into two major groups based on their substrate
binding. In papain-like enzymes, there is a direct proton transfer
between the catalytic Cys and His possible; however, in caspase-like
enzymes, the substrate is located between these catalytic residues.
In caspase-like cysteine proteases, the Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad
in the active site is responsible for the proteolytic activity, whereas
the protonation state of these residues is highly debated30,32−36 (neutral or zwitterionic form). According to the commonly accepted
mechanism, the catalysis takes place in two steps.30 When the substrate binds, the carbonyl of the scissile
peptide bond is buried in the oxy anion hole, which comprises the
backbone NH of Cys and Gly. The first step starts with the nucleophilic
attack of the deprotonated cysteine residue on the peptide carbonyl
carbon and the first tetrahedral intermediate is formed. Subsequently,
the acyl enzyme (thioester intermediate) is generated, and, at the
same time, a fragment of the substrate is released with an amine terminus
and the histidine residue in the protease is restored to its deprotonated
form (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Putative mechanism
of thioester formation (first step of the proteolysis)
by papain-like cysteine proteases.30

The second step starts with the
attack of a nucleophilic water
molecule on the carbonyl carbon of the acyl enzyme (Figure 2). At this stage, a second
tetrahedral intermediate is generated and a proton from the water
molecule is transferred to His. Consequently, the substrate–Cys
bond is split and the remaining S– might be neutralized
by the positively charged nitrogen of His whereas the free enzyme
is regenerated and the reaction can start over again. Dall and Brandstetter37 have successfully determined the crystal structure
of prolegumain (PDB code 4FGU) and could identify the catalytic residues (Cys189,
His148, and Asn42) in the active site. In addition, Dall and Brandstetter37 reported the crystal structure of the cysteine
protease legumain in complex with different substrate analogues (PDB
codes: 4AWA, 4AWB, 4AW9) and also describe
its substrate recognition. Inhibitors with Asn or Asp residues at
the P1 position were identified to be bound covalently to SG(Cys189).
Recently, Dall and Brandstetter successfully elucidated the crystal
structure of legumain in complex with cystatin E/M, which is the most
potent endogenous inhibitor38 of legumain
(PDB code: 4N6O(28)). In this structure, the substrate
is positioned similarly to a chloromethylketone-based inhibitor (verified
by superposition with 4AW9(37)) but is not covalently
bound in the active site. Moreover, the substrate binds canonically
and has both primed and nonprimed residues; therefore, it serves as
an ideal starting point for our computational studies (Figure 3, right).

proteolytic cleavage (hydrolysis)

The active site residues are represented as sticks; the enzyme carbons
are colored gray. The substrate carbons are colored orange, and the
relevant crystal structure waters are depicted as red spheres. Dotted
lines denote hydrogen bonds.

Because this was the first time that the structure of legumain
has been presented, there is no computational work in the literature
on this enzyme. However, a few research groups performed calculations
at different levels to elucidate the mechanism of two other members
of the cysteine protease family, namely, papain32,33,35,36,39,40 and caspase.41−45

In the active site of papain, the His159–Cys25 distance
is around 3.6 Å, and these are ideally positioned for proton
transfer between them. However, in the case of legumain, the corresponding
His148 is over 6 Å far from Cys189, and therefore, a direct proton
transfer is unlikely. In contrast, in legumain (and caspase), the
substrate binds between the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues.
Therefore, the most relevant theoretical work with respect to our
studies are the investigations of Sulpizi et al.,42 who applied DFT-based QM/MM methods to calculate the hydrolysis
of the acyl enzyme complex for caspase-3 starting from a covalently
bound inhibitor.

Their calculations suggest that the attack
of the nucleophilic
water molecule (second step of the cleavage) leads to a geminal diol
intermediate and shows thereby a remarkable discrepancy between caspases
and papain. In addition, Miscione et al.43 performed DFT calculations in the gas phase to study thioester formation
for caspase-7 starting from a covalently bound inhibitor complex.
Their model was built up from fragments of the active site residues
and the Ac-DEVD inhibitor. After removal of the S–C bond, the
catalytic cysteine was terminated by a H atom and the substrate by
−NH3CH3. The authors propose a multistep
proton-hopping mechanism via deprotonation of the neighboring peptide
nitrogen and making use of the substrate aspartic acid COO– side chain in order to activate the cysteine. At the same time,
they reject a much simpler one-step mechanism due to a higher calculated
barrier; however, the surrounding protein environment and the solvent
are not considered in their gas-phase simulations.

Moreover,
although the active site of caspase-3 shows more similarity
with legumain, still there are several differences left. Because legumain
cleaves essentially behind asparagine, proton hopping with substrate
side chain participation is unfeasible. In caspase-3, the active site
water position is rather an analogue of papain; and in legumain, there
is an acidic residue (Glu190) close to the catalytic Cys189 that is
absolutely missing in both papain and caspase-3 (Figure 3). Besides, legumain is the
only protease in which an aspartic acid residue next to the catalytic
histidine is ring-closed to a succinimide. Therefore, there remains
a number of open questions regarding the detailed reaction mechanism
of legumain, particularly the protonation state of the active site
residues, the activation of Cys189, and the role of the residues Glu190,
His148, and SNN147 and the water molecules.

In the present work,
we studied the mechanism of both the protease
and the ligase activity of the human legumain in atomistic detail
in solution. We employed a comprehensive QM/MM approach at the B3LYP/DFT
level of theory using the extensive functionality provided by the
recently developed QM/MM46,47 modules in the NWChem48 software package to investigate the attack of
the Cys189 on the scissile peptide bond, the possible proton transfer
pathways, the water attack, and the product release. Afterward, free
energy calculations over the reaction coordinates were employed to
determine the rate-limiting step of the proteolysis reaction. In addition,
different ligation/transpeptidation mechanisms were studied that were
in good agreement with experimental findings. Nevertheless, we would
like to emphasize that detailed experimental work is not part of the
present paper.

Results and Discussion
The theoretical
tools that have been used in these calculations
are discussed in the methods section (see the Supporting Information (SI)) and in prior publications.46,49−53 Important to the discussion here is that they are applied to a system
containing the protein/substrate complex solvated in aqueous background.
To develop a reaction mechanism for the cleavage step, it is necessary
to have a reliable initial structure (RS structure) that is based
on a good resolution X-ray structure of the legumain/cystatin complex
(PDB code: 4N6O(28)) followed by system preparation and
optimization, as discussed in the “Computational Details and
Methods” section of the SI. Because
the protonation state of the Cys189-His148 ion pair has a large influence
on the predicted mechanism, it has to be chosen very carefully. Due
to the fact that in the cystatin–legumain complex the NE(His148)–SG(Cys189)
distance is over 6 Å and in prolegumain these residues are only
4.14 Å from each other, first we supposed that the proton shuttle
between them might occur, before the substrate enters the active site,
and as soon as the catalytic cycle is completed and the substrate
leaves the pocket, the zwitterion regenerates. Hence, first we tried
to simulate the acylation pathway starting with a positively charged
His148 and a negatively charged Cys189-thiolate using the spring method,
as described above. However, all of our attempts to generate this
reaction path failed. Relaxation of the system after removal of the
constraints resulted in the starting geometry.

Afterward, systematic
titration calculations using MOE2016.08 pointed
out that at the pH of the protease activity (around pH 5.0) of both
Cys189 and His148 is neutral in the reactant state. Therefore, an
alternative reaction pathway was necessary, one that initiates the
deprotonation of the catalytic cysteine.

Proteolysis Pathway
Formation
of the First Intermediate (INT1)
In the reactant
state (Figure 4, left),
the P1 substrate carbonyl is tightly anchored into the oxy anion hole
of the active site by strong interactions with the N(Gly149) and N(Cys189)
backbone nitrogens. The role of the oxy anion hole is very important.
On the one hand, it polarizes the P1 C=O and weakens the C–N
peptide bond, and on the other hand, it stabilizes the carbonyl oxygen
and O–, which is generated during the reaction.
The SG(Cys189) is ideally positioned for a nucleophilic attack, whereas
the catalytic water, which participates in the hydrolysis, is located
close to the substrate carbonyl and NE(His148) and is also strongly
hydrogen bonded between them.

the reaction path
of the substrate cleavage showing a zoom of the active site of the
legumain–pentapeptide substrate complex. Enzyme residues are
represented by gray carbons, and the substrate is represented by orange
ones. Dotted lines denote H-bonds.

Note that there is no catalytic water present in the active
site
of the legumain–cystatin complex (PDB code 4N6O(28)) because the position of the water is occupied by C=O
of the P2′ amino acid. However, after shortening the cystatin
to a pentamer (see SI) and performing molecular
dynamics simulations, the catalytic water (Wat305) could enter the
pocket and take the position where it is excellently oriented for
the reaction. In order to initiate the cleavage process, a harmonic
restraint of 1.8 Å was imposed on the SG(Cys189)–C(Asn302)
distance to simulate the attack of the sulfur. Upon optimization,
we could observe a coordinated attack of SG(Cys189) on the P1 carbonyl
carbon and a proton transfer of HG(Cys189) to the P1′ scissile
peptide nitrogen, leading to an intermediate disruption of the peptide
bond and generation of the acyl enzyme (INT1, Figure 4, right). Unexpectedly, no tetrahedral intermediate
(Figure 1) was generated
but a thioester, which would rather correspond to the second intermediate.
This remained stable even after removal of the constraint and subsequent
relaxation. In this first intermediate state (INT1), the position
of the active site water, histidine, succinimide, and serine residues
barely changes and also the participating carbonyl remains in the
oxy anion hole. The largest movement can be associated with the substrate
and the catalytic cysteine (Cys189).

Formation of the Second
Intermediate (INT2)
The cleavage
reaction proceeds with hydrolysis of the thioester. The position and
orientation of the catalytic water are optimal for nucleophilic attack.

The H-bond distances between OW(WTR305)–O(Asn302) and OW(WTR305)–ND1(His148)
are as short as 2.74 and 2.67 Å, respectively, which facilitates
the polarization and thereby activation of the water molecule. To
model this reaction step, a spring of 1.35 Å was applied to the
OW(WTR305)–C(Asn302) distance, which yielded the second stable
intermediate state (INT2, Figure 5, left) along the reaction coordinates of the cleavage
procedure. However, the 2HW(WTR305) was not transferred to the ND1(His148)
as expected; indeed, a diol was generated, as found also by Sulpizi
et al.42 for caspase-3. Importantly, His148
does not serve as a general base during water activation and attack.
Transition state search calculations (see the SI and the Reaction Energetics and Transition
State Search section) show that the 3HW(WTR305) proton is pulled
off by the carbonyl oxygen O(Asn302) and the remaining OH– attacks the carbon to produce a tetrahedral intermediate diol, which
is still covalently bound to Cys189.

structures along the
reaction path of the substrate cleavage showing a zoom of the active
site of the legumain–pentapeptide complex. Enzyme residues
are represented by gray carbons, and the substrate is represented
by orange ones. Dotted lines denote H-bonds.

The second intermediate state (INT2) shows a tetrahedral
structure,
where the former water oxygen is coordinated with NE2(His148) and
the SG(Cys189) is H-bonded to OG(Ser215), N(Ser216), and the free
N-termini of Ser303. In addition, the participating carbonyl, which
now forms a diol, remains in the oxy anion hole.

Generation
of the Product State (PS)
To complete the
proteolysis, the C(Asn302)–SG(Cys189) bond must break to regenerate
the enzyme and to release the cleavage products. To achieve bond breaking,
the proton (2HW(WTR305)) from the former carbonyl (O(Asn302)) was
transferred to SG(Cys189) by using a constraint of 1 Å for the
given distance.

Consequently, the thioester was cleaved and
the proton (3HW(WTR305)) from the other oxygen (OW(WTR305)) of the
prior diol was shifted to NE2(His148). In order to clarify the correct
protonation state of the product step, further attempts were carried
out to transfer the 3HW(WTR305) proton either to N(Ser303) to generate
a zwitterion between the cleaved C- and N-termini or to the carboxyl
end of the C-terminus to preserve neutrality at the cleavage site.
However, after release of the constraint, the proton of interest always
shifted back to NE2(His148) (Figure 5, right). Therefore, in the most stable state, the
carboxylate C-terminus is deprotonated and is strongly H-bonded to
SG(Cys189) as well as to the positively charged NE2(His148), and the
N-terminus is neutral. We suppose that when the N-terminus leaves
the pocket, it removes the proton from NE2(His148) probably via a
water molecule and thereby regenerates the initial protonation state.

In addition, another alternative pathway has also been considered
in which the P1 asparagine first forms a succinimide to enhance the
reactivity and upon nucleophilic attack of the SG(Cys189) a tetrahedral
intermediate should form. However, this attempt has failed because
during relaxation the system always fell back to the reactant state.

Ligation Pathway
As described in the Introduction, legumain exhibits unique pH-dependent dual protease–ligase
activity, whereas legumain is a protease at acidic conditions and
ligation takes place at more neutral pH.

In contrast to other
cysteine proteases like caspase or papain, in the case of legumain,
Dall et al. found the peptide ligase activity at pH 6.0 in human AEP
when they studied the mechanistic aspects of AEP inhibition by cystatin
E/M.28 Due to the higher crystallization
pH, the authors suggest that the legumain–hCE complex structure
rather corresponds to the ligase state. Moreover, they point out that
active site SG(Cys189) was rotated away from the scissile peptide
bond, suggesting that it is not directly involved in the ligation
reaction. Further experiments modifying the catalytic Cys189 also
support this theory. On the one hand, Dall et al. oxidized the Cys189
by adding S-methylmethanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to
generate a mixed disulfide Cys189–S–CH3,28 and on the other hand, Cys189 was mutated to
Met189 (data not shown, unpublished results).

In both cases,
the protease activity was suppressed, as expected;
however, the ligase activity was preserved. Their findings put forward
that there must be a mechanism without Cys189 participation, which
is not the exact reversal of proteolysis via a stable thioester.

Our in silico simulations gave further support to a possible Cys189
independent mechanism because, by using the spring method as described
in the SI, we could not generate the exact
backward pathway via Cys189–thioester.

Therefore, we
turned our attention to an alternative pathway, which
comprises the direct attack of the N-terminus on the carbonyl of the
C-terminus (Figure 6). Hence, first we started with the product state of the cleavage
reaction (protonated Cys189) and applied a restraint of 1.35 Å
between C(Asn302) and N(Ser303) to generate the peptide bond. However,
surprisingly, the desired reaction path could not be produced. In
the case of the cleavage mechanism, we have already seen that the
protonation state of the active site residues is very crucial for
the reaction mechanism to proceed, and we need to take into consideration
that ligation takes place at higher pH than the cleavage reaction.
Titration and pKa calculations (the pKa of Cys189 in the enzyme environment was 5.6)
therefore suggested that at pH 6.0 the catalytic cysteine, Cys189,
is present as a thiolate. Reoptimization of the system with deprotonated
Cys189 resulted in a proton shift between NE2(His148) and the carboxylate
of the C-terminus, which is comprehensible due to the subsequent charge
equalization. The newly generated reactant state (RS, Figure 7 left) was the starting point
for the ligation simulations.

Figure 6 Proposed ligation pathway without Cys189 participation
(left) and
the transpeptidation mechanism (right).

Figure 7 Reactant (left) and product (right) states of the ligation step.

In the reactant state, all participating
residues (Asn302, Ser303,
His148) are neutral, and Cys189 is deprotonated. The carboxylate proton
of the C-terminus is H-bonded to NE2(His148), and the oxygen is coordinated
by Ser303, whereas the proton migrates directly toward the OD2(Asn302)
and thereby is ideally positioned for transfer and consecutive water
formation. Thus, to model this reaction step, a constraint was applied
to transfer a proton from the P1′ N(Ser303) to P1 residue OD2(Asn302)
to activate both the C- and N-termini. After water formation and release,
as expected, the N-terminus attacks the carbonyl and the peptide bond
is formed (Figures 6 and 7 right).

Generation of the Product
Step Using S–(Cys189)
The calculated product state
of the ligase reaction fits very well
with the reactant state of the protease action (Figure S1). That is, either the substrate can leave the active
site or, upon reduction of the pH, the cleavage procedure can start
over again. The carbonyl of the scissile peptide bond points toward
the oxy anion hole (N(Gly149) and N(Cys189)), and the catalytic water
is again positioned by NE2(His148) and N(Ser303). Moreover, the negatively
charged cysteine thiolate is stabilized by the surrounding serine
residues (Ser215, Ser216) during the entire reaction pathway.

Further support and confirmation of the above calculated mechanism
arises from calculations with MMTS-blocked Cys189 (Cys189–S–CH3) and C189M mutant enzyme (see the SI).

Transpeptidation
The simulations have also shown that,
although we cannot generate the exact reverse pathway of the proteolysis,
the formation of a thioester and thereby transpeptidation are possible
(INT1, Figure 4 right).
We suppose that at this stage there is competition between the catalytic
water and the N-terminus. The sulfur of the thioester is not strong
enough as a base to remove the proton from the N-terminus due to the
fact that the water molecule is the stronger nucleophile (Figure 6 right).

Therefore,
as long as water is present in the active site, hydrolysis is favored
over ligation. To prove this theory, we removed the catalytic water
from the pocket, optimized the structure, and applied a constraint
of 1.35 Å between C(Asn302) and N(Ser303) to generate the peptide
bond. At the same time, the proton from N(Ser303) was automatically
transferred to SG(Cys189), and the reaction was complete. After removal
of the restraint, the generated transpeptidation product remained
stable.

Reaction Energetics and Transition State Search
In
order to achieve a complete overview of the catalytic pathway and
to designate the stationary points and free energy profile of the
reaction coordinate, we performed nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations46 between the reactant, intermediate, and product
states. The initial pathway for NEB calculations was calculated in
three steps for the cleavage reaction by linear interpolation between
the reactant, INT1, INT2, and product states of the entire solute–solvent
system with 15 or 20 beads/replicas for each segment. In the case
of ligation, the reaction energetics were calculated in one step,
from reactant to product, because no intermediate was found along
the reaction coordinates.

Proteolysis
In the reactant to the
intermediate step,
there are two important events along the reaction coordinates (Figure 8). The first one
is the transfer of the HG(Cys189) proton to the scissile peptide bond
nitrogen N(Ser303), and the second one is the attack of the thiolate
nucleophile on the carbonyl and thereby the formation of the thioester
structure. According to our calculations, the energy of this first
step determines the energy barrier and the overall reaction rate.
This point occurs at the maximum energy along the reaction path at
19.3 kcal (Table 1, Figure S6), which fits well with the findings
of Ma et al.54 for cathepsin K and Wei
et al.36 for papain. There are three important
structural changes that occur simultaneously as the reaction proceeds.
One is elongation of the C(Asn302)–N(Ser303) peptide bond,
the second one is transfer of the HG(Cys189) proton to the N-terminus,
and the third is nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated Cys189 on
the carbonyl to generate the thioester. The transition state (TS1)
is rather dissociated because at this point the scissile bonds are
already broken; however, neither the SG(Cys189)–C(Asn302) nor
the HG(Cys189)–N(Ser303) bond has been generated yet (Figure S6). Next, the thioester is produced and
the proton transfer occurs stepwise until the first intermediate state
is reached (INT1, Figure 4 right).

Figure 8 Calculated free energy profile for the ligation.

The second step of the reaction shows a rather
late transition
state (Figure S7, left), with a much lower
barrier of 7.0 kcal/mol. First, the catalytic water approaches the
carbonyl, accompanied by movement and strong coordination of His148,
where the NE2(His148)–OW(Wat305) distance remains between 2.65
and 2.81 Å during the whole diol formation. The transition state
search calculations also show that first the 2HW(Wat305) is pulled
off from the water oxygen and transferred to carbonyl oxygen and then
the remaining OH– attacks the carbonyl to build
a diol. This fact also clarifies the nature of the nucleophile. At
the transition state (TS2, Figure S7 left),
the 2HW(Wat305) is exactly shared between OW(Wat305) and O(Asn302)
with a bond distance of 1.21 Å each. Afterward, the OW(Wat305)–C(Asn302)
bond and thereby the diol (INT2, Figure 5 left) are generated rapidly, and the system
relaxes until a favorable conformation is reached.

To finish
the cleavage procedure, the SG(Cys189)–C(Asn302)
bond breaks readily with a low barrier of 7.1 kcal/mol. In addition,
there are two proton transfers along these coordinates. At the transition
state (TS3, Figure S7 right), the SG(Cys189)–C(Asn302)
bond is already broken and the 3HW(Wat305) proton is shared between
His148 and the substrate carboxylate with a bond length of 1.27 Å,
separately. Subsequently, the 2HW(Wat305) proton shuttles to SG(Cys189)
to complete the proteolysis, which results in the expected product
state (Figure 7 right),
where the substrate can either leave the pocket or religate.

Ligation
As described in the Ligation
pathway section, ligation can proceed in one step without Cys189
participation, which has also been confirmed both theoretically and
experimentally by applying a Met189 mutant and/or disulfide Cys189–S–CH3 of the wild-type enzyme (see also the SI). Figure 8 shows the QM/MM energy profile of the ligation.

of the free energy curves (Figure 8 for the wild-type enzyme and Figure S3 for the C189M mutant) are quite similar; however, the Met189
variant shows a slightly lower barrier of 12.6 kcal/mol in comparison
with the native enzyme (16.4 kcal/mol). However, it was not possible
to compare the reaction rates experimentally because at some extent
a reverse reaction might always take place for the wild-type enzyme.
The small difference in energies might be due to the fact that in
the case of the methionine mutant there is no charge on residue 189
and, hence, the overall charge of the active site is 0; in contrast,
in the native enzyme, Cys189 bears a negative charge. In addition,
ligation with the native enzyme starts with a neutral C- and N-termini
and neutral His148; although the mechanism with Cys189–S–CH3 and/or C189M mutant begins with a neutral N-terminus, the
deprotonated C-terminus and protonated His148 provide a better charge
distribution. Both reactions (native and modified enzyme) are initiated
by a shortening of the C–N distance and proton transfer from
N(Ser303) to the carboxylate of the C-terminus.

However, for
Cys189–S–CH3 and Met189 mutant,
an additional proton transfer from His148 to carboxylate is necessary
to liberate the water molecule.

Transpeptidation
Transition state search and NEB simulations
have shown that the transpeptidation is a one-step procedure, where
proton transfer from the N-terminus to SG(Cys189) and attack of the
N(Ser303) on the carbonyl and thereby the formation of the peptide
bond are concerted. Calculations of the energy along the NEB coordinates
give further support that hydrolysis is favored over ligation as long
as water is present in the active site. Although the reaction barrier
of the transpeptidation is 23.3 kcal/mol (Figures 9, S9) and thus
comparable with thioester formation (19.3 kcal/mol), it is much higher
than the barrier of hydrolysis of the thioester (7.1 kcal/mol). Consequently,
transpeptidation is possible only if the catalytic water either leaves
the pocket or has no space to enter the active site (e.g., legumain/cystatin
complex).

Conclusions
In
this publication, we present mechanistic details of the enzymatic
protease and ligase activity of human legumain using hybrid QM/MM
methods at the DFT/b3lyp level of theory. Our calculations were based
on the crystal structure of human legumain in complex with human cystatin
E (PDB code 4N6O(28)) and on the experimental findings of
Dall et al.28,37,55

In addition, we could clarify the pH dependence as a switch
between
the unique dual asparaginyl–endopeptidase and ligase activity
of legumain. Thus, the protonation state of the catalytic cysteine
(Cys189) and histidine (His148) is crucial for the reaction mechanism
to proceed toward either cleavage or ligation. Because at lower pH
the cysteine is protonated, the calculated proteolysis mechanism starts
with protonated Cys189, which transfers its proton to the scissile
nitrogen to generate a thiolate, which can then attack the peptide
carbonyl. At the same time, His148 is neutral and positions the catalytic
water for the hydrolysis step. Importantly, no papain-like classical
intermediate was found because the first intermediate is already the
acyl enzyme. The second step of the reaction is hydrolysis of the
thioester and starts with attack of the water on the carbonyl and
results in a diol, similarly to caspases,42 which is the second intermediate along the proteolysis pathway.
Finally, a water proton from the diol is translated to Cys189 to complete
the reaction, where the role of the catalytic His148 is to serves
as a base to the diol during product formation. The calculated reaction
energetics have shown that the rate-limiting step of the cleavage
step is the formation of the thioester with a barrier of 19.3 kcal/mol,
which is a range similar to that of other representatives of the cysteine
protease family (papain36 and cathepsin56).

Further support was given by calculations
(and experimental results)
from point mutations. Replacement of the neighboring residue Glu190
by Lys190 lowers the reaction barrier (see the SI) and speeds up the process because the positively charged
Lys190 residue favors deprotonation of Cys189. Moreover, Lys190 reduces
the local pKa of Cys189 and shifts the
pH activity range for the proteolysis to lower pH.

The ligation
step can proceed as a one-step procedure without cysteine
participation. This surprising fact has also been proven experimentally
both by blocking Cys189 using MMTS and by applying the point mutation
C189M. While in both cases no cleavage was possible, the ligation
activity remained active. Our simulations have also revealed that
at elevated pH the catalytic cysteine becomes deprotonated and the
ligation is assisted by the catalytic histidine His148 only, through
proton transfer to the C-terminus carboxylate and thereby to the catalytic
water. Moreover, we could not generate a reaction path with protonated
Cys189; therefore, only legumain with deprotonated Cys189 can act
as a ligase, which is consistent with the experimental pH profile
of the reaction. The exact reverse reaction of the proteolysis is
not possible because in the presence of the catalytic water the sulfur
of the thioester is not strong enough as a base to remove the proton
from the N-terminus. However, transpeptidation via thioester is possible
if there is no catalytic water available at the active site. In addition,
both for ligation and transpeptidation, the pH plays a crucial role
also for the substrate because the incoming peptide needs to be neutral.

We have demonstrated that experimental findings can be explained
and supported by computational studies and could elucidate the complete
reaction mechanism of legumain for both the protease and ligase activity
in atomistic detail while considering the whole protein and solvent
surrounding. While calculations of other groups on further cysteine
protease enzymes (papain, caspase, and cathepsin) were based on a
covalently bound inhibitor–enzyme complex, which was modified
to generate a starting structure, we started our simulations with
a perfect reactant state mimic complex of cystatin–legumain.

Moreover, this is first time that the complete reaction pathways
of both enzymatic activities are presented and is in excellent agreement
with experimental data.
