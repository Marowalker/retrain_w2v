Flavin-dependent
halogenases are known to regioselectively introduce
halide substituents into aromatic moieties, for example, the indole
ring of tryptophan. The process requires halide salts and oxygen instead
of molecular halogen in the chemical halogenation. However, the reduced
cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) has to be
regenerated using a flavin reductase. Consequently, coupled biocatalytic
steps are usually applied for cofactor regeneration. Nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NADH) mimics can be employed stoichiometrically
to replace enzymatic cofactor regeneration in biocatalytic halogenation.
Chlorination of l-tryptophan is successfully performed using
such NADH mimics. The efficiency of this approach has been compared
to the previously established enzymatic regeneration system using
the two auxiliary enzymes flavin reductase (PrnF) and alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH). The reaction rates of some of the tested mimics were found
to exceed that of the enzymatic system. Continuous enzymatic halogenation
reaction for reaction scale-up is also possible.

==== Body
Halogenated natural products
are of high biological and biochemical relevance. Many halogenated
metabolites or their derivatives found their way into pharmaceutical
and agricultural applications.1−4 Although different chemical halogenation methods
are known, most of them suffer from low regioselectivity and/or environmental
burden.5,6 In view of the biosynthesis of halogenated
metabolites, FAD-dependent halogenases have become promising alternatives
for the regioselective halogenation of natural and synthetic molecules
using only halide salts and molecular oxygen under mild reaction conditions.7−9 However, this enzyme class still faces several drawbacks that compromise
a wider application in biocatalytic reactions: low activity, combined
with a substrate scope that is mainly limited to certain core structures,10,11 as well as their dependence on the cofactor FADH2.12 Hence, the enzymatic halogenation reaction requires
a complex cofactor regeneration system that maintains a steady FADH2 supply. The regeneration systems for this group of enzymes
usually includes two auxiliary enzymes in addition to the halogenase
in an enzyme cascade system (Figure 1).12−14

Figure 1 Enzymatic tryptophan halogenation with cofactor regeneration
comprising
a flavin reductase and a dehydrogenase.

Enzymatic cofactor regeneration systems for biocatalytic
halogenation
rely on the combination of a flavin reductase like PrnF from Pseudomonas fluorescens,8,12 RebF from Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes,15,16 or SsuE from Thermus thermophilus(12) with either an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) or a glucose
dehydrogenase (CDX-901). The ADH (e.g., from Rhodococcus ruber) regenerates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) from NAD+ by catalyzing the oxidation of isopropanol to acetone.8 A glucose dehydrogenase regenerates NAD(P)H by
catalyzing the oxidation of d-glucose to d-glucono-1,5-lactone,
followed by a nonenzymatic hydrolysis to gluconic acid.15−17 The complexity of these enzymatic cascades limits the usability
of halogenases in further applications and combination with other
synthetic reactions like in chemoenzymatic cascades.

As cofactor
regeneration is a common prerequisite for many biocatalytic
reactions, alternative nonenzymatic regeneration systems have been
proposed and investigated. The direct regeneration of FADH2 for tryptophan 7-halogenase PrnA was first reported using the organometallic
complex pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium bipyridine ([Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+) as catalyst and formate as electron donor
without requiring flavin reductase and NADH (additional regeneration
systems are summarized in Table S3, Supporting
Information).18 The use of a synthetic
mimic of the natural cofactor system is a promising approach. NADH
mimics have recently attracted attention for their implementation
as a regeneration system for cofactor-dependent enzymes.19,20 They are simpler compared to enzymatic cofactor regeneration system;
their application in the reactions is easy and does not require special
apparatus or preparations, making them more robust and easier to control.
Moreover, the reaction is scalable and proceeds in an aqueous medium
under mild conditions without affecting the enzymatic activity in
the biocatalysis. For these reasons we became interested in using
NADH mimics as a regeneration system for flavin-dependent halogenases.

NADH mimics have been applied in organic reductions as model systems
for understanding the mechanism of the natural biochemical reactions
or for their use in organic synthesis, for instance, the stereoselective
reduction of pyruvate under mild conditions using NADH mimics and
perchlorate.21 Moreover, the reduction
of thiobenzophenone to benzhydryl mercaptan has been described using
1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH).22 Medicinal applications have also been reported, where the reduced
nicotinamide derivative 1-carbamoylmethyl-3-carbamoyl-1,4-dihydropyridine
was used as a cosubstrate for activating the NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase
2 (NQO2), which further activates the antitumor prodrug 5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide
with higher efficiency and stability than the natural reduced nicotinamide
riboside.23 Other reports used the NADH
mimics to explain the mechanism of artemisinin’s antimalaria
activity in vitro, where the hydride transfer from BNAH reduced the
drug to give a product that can access the malaria parasite.24 Recently, the application of NADH mimics was
further investigated in biocatalysis.25

The use of NADH mimics was first studied with respect to the
functional
role of the pyridine ring in NADH,26 followed
by mechanistic investigation with BNAH. The application of NADH mimics
on NADH-dependent enzymes was first reported for the horse liver ADH,27,28 and further expanded to other enzymes including HbpA monooxygenase.29 Recently, several NADH mimics were synthesized
to replace the natural cofactor required by ene reductases from the
Old Yellow Enzyme family for biocatalytic reductions.19,25,30,31

As Paul et al. described previously, different synthetic NADH
mimics
can be easily obtained from inexpensive starting materials in two
synthetic steps. A pyridine derivative is N-alkylated
under reflux for 15 h to form a pyridinium salt and subsequently reduced
under inert atmosphere with Na2S2O4 forming the NADH mimicking dihydropyridine (Figure 2).19,32 The synthesis is straightforward
and does not require any harsh conditions, toxic reagents, or further
purification after the synthesis.

Figure 2 Synthesis of NADH mimics for FADH2 regeneration.18

The application of NADH mimics for the regeneration
of FADH2 required by FAD-dependent tryptophan halogenases
leads to
a much simpler enzymatic halogenation system as both auxiliary enzymes
would become redundant (Figure 3). To explore the applicability of NADH mimics as an alternative
cofactor regeneration system for tryptophan halogenases, three flavin-dependent
halogenases with different activities and regioselectivities were
investigated in detail.

Figure 3 Enzymatic tryptophan halogenation with cofactor
regeneration by
NADH mimics.

The tryptophan 5-halogenase
PyrH from Streptomyces rugosporus,33 the tryptophan 6-halogenase Thal from Streptomyces
albogriseolus,34 and the tryptophan
7-halogenase RebH from Lechevalieria
aerocolonigenes(16) were used as
model systems. The purified enzymes RebH and PyrH were first tested
using the standard protocol for the flavin-dependent halogenation
(see Supporting Information p S9), while
flavin reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase usually required for enzymatic
cofactor regeneration were omitted. The halogenation reactions were
performed employing 10 equiv of the NADH mimic BNAH (3a, 10 mM). Intriguingly, nearly 50% of tryptophan was halogenated
within 2 h and the reaction proceeded to full conversion after 24
h (Figure 4, Figure S2).

final volume 400 μL, 600 rpm at 25 °C.

To identify the NADH mimic with the highest FADH2 regeneration
efficiency, several literature-known NADH mimics 3 (BNAH 3a, mBU 3b, mAC 3c, and mCN 3d) were synthesized and tested with FAD-dependent halogenases
(Table 1; RebH: Figure 5; Thal: Figure 6A; PyrH: Figure S3B).

Interestingly, RebH (Figure 5) and Thal (Figure 6) showed the highest initial reaction rate and fastest
conversion
with 3a and 3c, even outperforming the enzymatic
cofactor regeneration system (ERS). The reaction proceeded 3.5–4.7
times faster than that with the enzymatic cofactor regeneration system
(Table 1, Figure S5). The highest FADH2 regeneration
efficiency was achieved with 3a, of which the structure
most closely resembles NADH. With RebH, 100% conversion of 1 mM tryptophan
was achieved after only 2 h using 3a, whereas 5 h was
needed to achieve full conversion under optimal reaction conditions
using ERS.8 This is in agreement with previous
reports on the NADH mimic 3a, where it was found to effect
40 times faster hydride transfer rate than NADH.29 With 3c the reaction rate is comparable to 3a and 3b with a butyl group at the pyridine
nitrogen initially shows high efficiency, exceeding that of 3c. However, the reaction with 3b seems to stop
at approximately 47% conversion, most likely because of the instability
and rapid oxidation of this cofactor. Mimic 3d with a
nitrile group at the pyridine ring displays the lowest reaction rate
and activity, a common trend for this mimic, which has a higher redox
potential (ca. −220 mV) compared to the others.35

Hence, the FADH2 regeneration
efficiency of the NADH
mimics is strongly affected by the R1 substituent in the
first place with preference for the carboxamide moiety (mimicking
the natural NADH) followed by the acetyl group. On the other hand,
the substituent at the pyridine nitrogen also affects the activity
of the mimic as observed for 3b (Table 1).

The stability of the mimic would
also play an important role in
the regeneration of FADH2, in particular in the case of 3b and 3d. This might be attributed to a more
rapid consumption of these NADH mimics in the reduction of FAD to
FADH2. Besides reaction of enzyme-bound FADH2 with O2 eventually leading to halogenation, FADH2 also reacts with molecular oxygen freely in solution. This
uncoupling reaction forms hydrogen peroxide and consumes NADH mimic
in a nonproductive manner. In addition, the accumulation of H2O2 may compromise the stability of the mimic and
halogenase activity.20 Catalase was added
to the reactions to prevent H2O2 accumulation.36

Notably, PyrH displays a lower reaction
rate and activity compared
to RebH and Thal with the NADH mimics but a higher reaction rate with
the ERS. However, both regeneration reactions are assumed to proceed
via reduction of FAD in solution independent of the halogenase. Subsequently,
FADH2 is rapidly bound to the enzyme.37 Recently, the direct regeneration of enzyme-bound FAD in
PyrH by photochemical regeneration using a reducing agent (ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) and light has been reported.38 To
test whether 3a might also directly reduce FAD inside
the halogenase, PyrH was reconstituted with FAD and washed thoroughly
to remove free FAD from the sample.

The spectrum of the sample
shows a distinct fine structure in the
band at 450 nm (Figure 7) and a shift of the band at 373–350 nm (Figure S6), which is characteristic of protein-bound FAD.
Bleaching of the band at 450 nm is observed upon addition of 3a to the oxygen-free solution, giving proof of FADH2 formation.39 Within 23 min, the conversion
is complete. After admission of oxygen to the cuvette, FADH2 is consumed, forming FAD within the protein as evidenced by the
same fine structure as that prior to addition of mimic 3a (Figure 7).

Figure 7 UV/vis spectra
monitoring the reduction of FAD bound to PyrH after
addition of 3a. Binding of FAD to PyrH is characterized
by a fine structure between 450 and 470 nm (highlighted in gray).
Reaction conditions: 40 μM PyrH, 10 mM BNAH (3a), FAD:protein ratio 1:2, 50 mM phosphate buffer at pH 8.3 and 20
°C, anaerobic.

These results indicate
that FAD might be slowly reduced by the
mimic directly inside the enzyme PyrH, which would explain the observed
differences between the two regeneration approaches of the halogenases
(Table 1) by their
different affinities to FAD. It should be noted that we cannot exclude
from these experiments a reduction via catalytic amounts of free FAD
in solution which is involved in a rapid binding equilibrium with
the enzyme.

As the activity of PyrH is much lower than RebH
and Thal when combined
with the NADH mimics, halogenation in the presence of NADH mimics
as the regeneration system might depend not only on the affinity of
FAD to the protein and the concentration of the flavin cofactor but
also on the enzymatic activity. Different concentrations of Thal were
used for testing the different NADH mimics (Figure 6). Halogenation of l-tryptophan
was faster with 12 μM Thal (1.2 mol %) compared to halogenation
at a 5 times lower halogenase concentration (2.4 μM Thal; 0.24
mol %).

Full conversion could not be obtained in the latter
case with the
tested NADH mimics. This indicates that the halogenation reaction
using NADH mimics as a FAD cofactor regeneration system is halogenase-dependent,
where the halogenase is rate-limiting. The FADH2 formed
reacts with oxygen to the flavin hydroperoxide, which either generates
hypohalous acid for halogenation or H2O2. On
the basis of the substrate conversion and the used amounts of mimic
with RebH and PyrH, the coupling efficiency was calculated to be less
than 1%. Therefore, increasing the halogenase load or engineering
the existing halogenase for higher efficiency would increase the halogenation
rate by directing the excess FADH2 toward halogenation
instead of H2O2 formation.31 The same reactions were performed with higher PyrH concentrations
(12 μM, 1.2 mol % and 24 μM, 2.4 mol %, Figure S3C). The reaction rate and conversion using the NADH
mimics increased upon doubling enzyme concentration, but still remained
lower than those in the reactions catalyzed by 1.2 mol % RebH and
Thal.

Since 3a had been identified as the best
NADH mimic
for enzymatic halogenation with RebH and Thal, reaction conditions
and NADH mimic concentration were further optimized for RebH and PyrH
because RebH and Thal have nearly similar activities and reaction
rates. Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM), pH 7.4 at 25 °C and 20 mM 3a were found as optimal conditions for both RebH and PyrH.
With use of tryptophan 7-halogenase RebH after a prolonged reaction
period, a dichlorinated tryptophan was formed as side product. This
side reaction can be avoided by monitoring the progress of the reaction
and through the enzyme load applied to the reaction (Figure S7, Table S1).

To investigate FAD reduction by 3a independently from
the halogenation, the reaction was performed at fixed concentration
of either FAD or 3a, while altering the other one and
the oxidation of 3a was measured via absorption at 360
nm. As expected, the reaction rate was almost proportional to the
FAD concentration (Figure 8A). Continuous increase in FAD concentration showed an increased
rate of 3a oxidation. However, FAD concentrations exceeding
that of 3a resulted in no further improvement. The same
was observed with increasing concentration of 3a at a
fixed FAD concentration (data not shown). A steady FADH2 supply is crucial for the biohalogenation reaction; however, its
accumulation results in H2O2 formation. As the
coupling efficiency of the halogenation reaction is rather low, a
certain ratio of FAD:3a is required to ensure a continuous
biohalogenation without shifting the equilibrium toward H2O2 formation. Therefore, different FAD concentrations
were tested in the biohalogenation reaction with 3a.
As expected, lower FAD concentrations (20, 50 μM) showed higher
conversion of tryptophan, while using 1:1 molar ratio of FAD:3a did not result in any product formation (Figure 8B). This phenomenon was also
observed previously with styrene monooxygenase, where the higher FAD
concentration results in aerobic reoxidation of FADH2 and
consequently H2O2 formation instead of the product
chlorotryptophan.31

Figure 8 (A) Hydride transfer
reaction between 3a and FAD.
The reaction was monitored by measuring the oxidation of 3a at 360 nm. Reaction conditions: 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 30
mM NaCl, 150 μM 3a, 5–300 μM FAD in
1 mL volume. (B) Biohalogenation reaction using 3a at
variable FAD concentrations. Reaction conditions: 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl, 10 mM 3a, 1–5000 μM
FAD, 1.2 mol % RebH, 650 U mL–1 catalase, 25 °C
for 1.5 h in 200 μL volume.

To prove that the NADH mimic regeneration system is also
suitable
for enzymatic halogenation using immobilized halogenases, we employed
this system for the chlorination of l-tryptophan. RebH and
PyrH were immobilized as cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) as
described previously, but without the addition of the auxiliary enzymes.40,41 At a 20 mM concentration of 3a, full conversion of
0.5 mM tryptophan was achieved within 5 h, a relatively shorter time
compared to that for the enzymatic cofactor regeneration system (Figure S8, Table S2). Notably, the initial reaction
rates of each RebH and PyrH under the same reaction conditions and
enzyme concentrations are 1.3–1.9 times faster using 3a compared to that with the ERS, which has also been found
when using the purified enzymes (Figure S9). This proves the utility of the NADH mimics as a valuable alternative
regeneration system for FAD-dependent halogenases.19,29

With most of the synthetic mimics, the overall reaction proceeds
faster than the enzymatic cofactor regeneration system (Figure 5, Figure 6A, Figure S9).
However, after an initial phase, rapid consumption of the NADH mimics
and a significant decline in the halogenation reaction rates were
detected using immobilized enzymes.

Continuous addition of the
mimics is one approach to overcome this
problem. Incremental addition of the substrate and the NADH mimic 3a was selected after several attempts for scaling up the
reaction using the immobilized enzymes. It was possible to run the
reactions for up to 24 days using RebH CLEAs and 15 days using PyrH
CLEAs without the necessity of exchanging the reaction buffer or adding
more halogenase or cofactor.

A semipreparative scale reaction
using the cross-linked enzyme
aggregates of RebH with continuous addition of 3a as
the sole regeneration factor was performed. Five equivalents of 3a was initially applied for biocatalytic chlorination of
10 mg of l-tryptophan (0.05 mmol) by RebH CLEAs in 500 mL
of reaction buffer. On the basis of the consumption of the reactants, l-tryptophan and 3a were added incrementally in
the course of the reaction (Figure S11, Scheme S3). After 8 days, 102 mg of l-tryptophan (0.5 mmol)
were chlorinated to 7-chlorotryptophan by using 17.8 mol equiv of 3a and RebH CLEAs obtained from 6 L of Escherichia
coli culture. For the product purification, Boc-protection
was conducted, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. Finally,
a yield of 74.9% of Boc-7-chlorotryptophan was obtained (Figure S12). Currently, the low coupling efficiency
of tryptophan halogenases represents a major drawback for the applicability
of the preparative scale reaction. Because of the competing H2O2 formation, a large percentage of NADH mimic
is being consumed.

This result, in comparison to the previous
report on the upscaling
of the enzymatic halogenation reaction,41 has revealed the usability of the NADH mimic regeneration system
for the scale-up reaction comparable to the reported results using
ERS. FAD-dependent halogenases such as RebH can further function for
prolonged periods (>20 days) using the NADH mimics regeneration
system;
most likely, the instability of the auxiliary enzymes impedes longer
reaction times using ERS. Halogenated products or byproducts of the
auxiliary enzyme (ADH) may have a detrimental effect on the catalytic
activity of the enzymes (product/byproduct inhibition). This provides
another attractive advantage of the NADH mimic over the ERS.

In conclusion, NADH mimics have successfully been exploited for
FADH2 regeneration as an alternative to the ERS in the
enzymatic halogenation of tryptophan. Their synthesis is simple and
they are obtained from inexpensive starting material. FAD reduction
using NADH mimics circumvents the implementation of two auxiliary
enzymes for cofactor regeneration, facilitating the reaction setup.
Mimics 3a and 3b led to faster halogenation
reactions using purified halogenase than did a commonly used ERS.
In addition, the mimics were used in a semipreparative tryptophan
chlorination reaction catalyzed by immobilized tryptophan 7-halogenase
RebH to produce 126.7 mg (74.9% yield) over the course of 8 days.
Because of the simplicity of the NADH mimic regeneration system, it
could be employed in the course of halogenases engineering via directed
evolution. In particular, the mimics might show potential when improving
halogenase thermostability because the auxiliary enzymes lack the
required stability at elevated temperature. Halogenase engineering
might improve the coupling efficiency that eventually would improve
the performance of NADH mimics applied together with FAD-dependent
halogenases. This will facilitate and improve the applicability of
FAD-dependent halogenases for chemical biotransformation.
