The oxidations of formate and methanol
on nitrogen-doped carbon
nanotubes decorated with palladium nanoparticles were studied at both
the single-nanotube and ensemble levels. Significant voltammetric
differences were seen. Pd oxide formation as a competitive reaction
with formate or methanol oxidation is significantly inhibited at high
overpotentials under the high mass transport conditions associated
with single-particle materials in comparison with that seen with ensembles,
where slower diffusion prevails. Higher electro-oxidation efficiency
for the organic fuels is achieved.

1 Introduction
Increased
interest in alternative fuel sources has led to the separate
application of both formate and methanol in fuel cells. Their use
as power sources is appealing due to their high energy density and
ease of transportation and storage, in contrast to hydrogen fuel cells.1−5 Pd-based materials have been intensely studied as superior and cost-effective
electrocatalysts in the oxidation of both formate and methanol.6 For formate oxidation, it has been suggested
that Pd-based catalysts have a better performance in comparison with
Pt, as the catalytic reactions on Pd follow a direct pathway and no
poisoning intermediates are produced.7,8 Pd-based materials
are also considered to be better catalysts in alkaline media for methanol
oxidation than Pt-based materials owing to their improved kinetics
and, again, lower poisoning from adsorbed intermediates.9 However, the instability of the Pd-based catalysts
can lead to relatively low energy transformation efficiency.10,11 Improving the electrocatalytic stability remains a critical obstacle
in the development of Pd-based electrocatalysts in both formate and
methanol fuel cells, and a fundamental understanding of Pd deactivation
due to its high surface sensitivity is still incomplete.6,12

The electrocatalytic behavior of newly produced materials
are commonly
assessed by drop-casting the catalysts onto electrode surfaces and
then performing electrochemical tests to analyze their performance.
However, the interpretation of such a multilayered, porous drop-cast
surface is complex and hard to analyze.13−19 Moreover, the most commonly used types of electrodes in these studies
are macroelectrodes, at which the mechanism and kinetics can be masked
by the limited, slow mass transport conditions.

In this work,
we first develop an improved electrode modification
method by modifying a carbon microwire electrode in situ with well-separated
individual catalyst entities. This modification is achieved by inserting
the wire electrode in a very dilute suspension of the nitrogen-doped
carbon nanotubes decorated with palladium nanoparticles (N-CNT-Pd).
Also present in the solution is the redox species of interest (formate
or methanol). Over a period of time individual catalyst entities (N-CNT-Pd)
continuously and randomly collide with the wire electrode due to their
Brownian motion. Some of the N-CNT-Pd becomes immobilized on the electrode
surface, forming a layer of low coverage. After immobilization the
voltammetric response of the modified electrode is recorded in the
same solution. In addition to these surface modification studies,
a single-particle electrochemical method based on “nanoimpacts”
was applied. This technique relies on the random collision of individual
nanoparticles with a potentiostated electrode where control of the
potential leads to mediated electron transfer on the surface of the
impacting nanoparticle.20−27 The current amplification from mediated electron transfer is analyzed
and can be applied to the fundamental mechanisms and dynamics of electrochemical
processes at the single-entity level.28 In this work, formate oxidation on individual impacting N-CNT-Pd
was studied with the nanoimpact method. The above methods, including
both in situ modification and the nanoimpact experiments, lead to
the spatial isolation of the catalyst particles on the electrode surface,
creating high mass transport conditions for the oxidation processes,
which provide new insights into the electrocatalytic mechanisms of
formate and methanol oxidation on palladium and how this is influenced
by mass transport.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Sodium formate (≥98%),
methanol (99.99%), NaClO4, and NaOH were received from
Sigma-Aldrich. Nitrogen gas (N2) was supplied from BOC,
Surrey, U.K. All solutions were prepared with deionized water of resistivity
not less than 18.2 MΩ cm (25 °C, Millipore). The preparation
and characterization of nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes decorated
with palladium nanoparticles (N-CNT-Pd) were detailed in previous
papers.28,29

2.2 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
of Formate and Methanol
Oxidation on the GC Electrode Drop-Cast with N-CNT-Pd
A suspension
of N-CNT-Pd (9.2 × 10–12 M) was prepared by
adding 2.4 mg of N-CNT-Pd to 5 mL of chloroform, followed by sonication
in a Fisher Scientific FB15050 ultrasonic bath for 1 min. A glassy-carbon
(GC) macroelectrode (d = 3.0 mm) was polished with
three grades of diamond spray (3.0, 1.0, and 0.1 μm) and then
sonicated in water and left to dry under an N2 atmosphere.
The as-prepared N-CNT-Pd suspension was then drop-cast on the GC electrode
and dried under an N2 atmosphere.

Electrochemical
measurements were conducted in a double Faraday cage with an Autolab
potentiostat (Metrohm-Autolab BV, The Netherlands) using a three-electrode
system at 298 K. For the drop-cast experiments, the modified GC electrode
was used as the working electrode, with platinum foil and a saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) as the counter electrode and the reference
electrode, respectively. Before the measurements a solution containing
5 M formate and 5 M NaClO4 (or 10 M methanol and 1 M NaOH)
was bubbled with N2 for 10 min to remove dissolved O2, and an atmosphere of N2 was maintained during
the experiment. Two control experiments were carried out: an unmodified
GC electrode in 5 M formate + 5 M NaClO4 (or 10 M methanol
+ 1 M NaOH) and a modified GC electrode in 5 M NaClO4 (or
1 M NaOH).

2.3 CV of Formate and Methanol
Oxidation on the
Carbon Microwire Electrode in Situ Modified with N-CNT-Pd and the
Nanoimpact Experiments
In the in situ modification experiments,
the working electrode was carbon fiber microwire electrodes (ca. 7
μm in diameter and ca. 1 mm in length), which were fabricated
according to the procedure introduced in our previous work.30 Formate or methanol solution was degassed with
N2 for 10 min, and then a known concentration of N-CNT-Pd
suspension was added and bubbled with N2 for 30 s to make
a well-dispersed and diluted suspension of N-CNT-Pd. CV was recorded
immediately after a clean carbon microwire electrode was inserted
in the suspension containing formate or methanol and after the electrode
was in situ modified in the same solution for a certain time. The
nanoimpact experiments were conducted by scanning chronoamperometry
immediately after a clean carbon microwire electrode was inserted
in the above solutions. For counting and analysis of the current spikes,
the software “SignalCounter” was used.31

3 Results and Discussion
We first investigate the CV of formate and methanol oxidation on
glassy-carbon (GC) electrodes drop-cast with N-CNT-Pd to evidence
the catalytic ability of the N-CNT-Pd toward these oxidation processes.
Mechanistic considerations are made. Second, we measure and analyze
the CV of first formate and second methanol oxidation on carbon microwire
electrodes which have been modified in situ with individual spatially
well separated N-CNT-Pd tubes via their random collision and immobilization
on the wire electrode. Third, nanoimpact experiments are conducted
by recording chronoamperometry at a carbon microwire electrode in
an aqueous suspension of N-CNT-Pd in the presence of formate. Current
spikes in the chronoamperograms resulting from formate oxidation on individual (single) impacting N-CNT-Pd are detected and
analyzed. Similar experiments are attempted for the oxidation of methanol.
Finally, the results from all the experiments are compared and chemical
mechanisms inferred and discussed.

3.1 CV of Drop-Cast N-CNT-Pds
The cyclic
voltammetric responses of formate and methanol oxidation were separately
investigated on N-CNT-Pd modified GC electrodes (of ca. 3.0 mm in
diameter). To study the formate oxidation, an unmodified GC electrode was first voltammetrically scanned in an aqueous solution
containing 5 M NaClO4 and 5 M formate. No voltammetric
signal was observed, as shown in Figure 1A (dotted line). Subsequently 0.96 μg
of N-CNT-Pd was drop-cast onto the GC electrode and left to dry under
an N2 atmosphere. The amount of N-CNT-Pd drop-cast in the
experiment corresponds to a coverage of ∼1 monolayer, assuming
the CNTs are perfectly tesselated on the electrode surface (see the Supporting Information). In reality a tangled,
irregular multilayer is likely formed. Figure 1A shows the CV of the above modified GC electrode
in 5 M NaClO4 in the absence (dashed line) and presence
(solid line) of 5 M formate, respectively. The CV of the modified
GC electrode in the formate solution shows a clear formate oxidation
peak at −0.08 V vs SCE and a back anodic peak at around −0.02
V vs SCE (solid line). No oxidation feature was observed in the absence
of formate (dashed line). The formate oxidation is known to be highly
surface sensitive, and at high overpotentials it is inhibited by the
formation of a palladium oxide layer.6,11 It has been
suggested that on the reverse scan the reduction of the oxide layer
leads to the recommencement of the electrochemical process.11

Figure 1 (A) Voltammograms of a GC electrode (d = 3.0 mm)
modified with 0.96 μg of N-CNT-Pd recorded in 5 M NaClO4(aq) in the absence (dashed line) and presence (solid line)
of 5 M formate. Also shown is the voltammetic response of the bare
GC electrode in 5 M NaClO4 + 5 M formate (dotted line).
Scan rate: 50 mV s–1. (B) Voltammograms of a GC
electrode (d = 3.0 mm) modified with 1.20 μg
of N-CNT-Pd in 1 M NaOH(aq) in the absence (dashed line) and presence
(solid line) of 10 M methanol. Also shown is the voltammetric response
of the bare GC electrode in 1 M NaOH + 10 M methanol (dotted line).
Scan rate: 50 mV s–1.

In order to characterize the palladium oxidation process,
the voltammetric
response of a bulk palladium microelectrode (radius 5.4 μm)
was recorded in the absence of formate. The CV (black line in Figure S1A in the Supporting Information) in
5 M NaClO4 shows a pair of asymmetric redox peaks for Pd
oxide formation and reduction: a broad Pd oxidation wave on the forward
scan and a sharp peak for Pd oxide reduction on the backward scan.
The reduction of the Pd oxide is found to occur at ∼0.0 V vs
SCE. This potential is comparable to the peak potential of formate
oxidation (−0.08 V vs SCE) as recorded on the drop-cast N-CNT-Pd
(solid line in Figure 1A). On the reverse scan of the voltammetry of formate oxidation at
a drop-cast N-CNT-Pd electrode, a sharp increase of the oxidation
current is observed (solid line in Figure 1A). This sharp increase in current is found
to occur at the potentials of Pd oxide reduction where Pd active sites
are released.11 This observation further
evidences that the decrease of the oxidation current on the forward
scan is caused, at least in part, by the formation of a Pd oxide layer.

We next consider the oxidation of methanol at a N-CNT-Pd modified
GC electrode and at the Pd microelectrode. Voltammograms are shown
in Figure 1B and Figure S1B in the Supporting Information, respectively.
The results for methanol oxidation mirror those found for formate.
An anodic peak was observed at −0.18 V vs SCE on the modified
GC electrode in 1 M NaOH containing 10 M methanol (solid line in Figure 1B), and a small oxidation
peak was found on the backward scan at around −0.45 V vs SCE.
In the absence of methanol, the voltammetric responses of both the
drop-cast N-CNT-Pd (dashed line in Figure 1B) and the Pd microelectrode (black line
in Figure S1B) demonstrate that Pd oxide
reduction occurs near −0.4 V vs SCE in 0.1 M NaOH. This value
of −0.4 V is more negative than the peak potential for methanol
oxidation (−0.18 V vs SCE) on the drop-cast N-CNT-Pd (solid
line in Figure 1B).
Hence, a significant surface coverage of Pd oxide has probably formed
before the methanol oxidation peak current, and a further deactivation
of the Pd active sites leads to significant inhibition toward methanol
oxidation.10 Moreover, the methanol oxidation
is significantly less favorable at the relatively negative potentials
for Pd oxide reduction; hence, a much smaller back anodic peak (solid
line in Figure 1B)
is observed in comparison to that found with the formate oxidation
(solid line in Figure 1A). The measured back-peaks in the two cases are independent of the
potential limit (beyond a minimum threshold value). It should be noted
that the increased current at high potentials (>0.3 V vs SCE) in Figure 1B (solid line) corresponds
to further methanol oxidation on the background carbon of the nanotube
and also the oxidation of the solvent.

Formate oxidation on
palladium is reported to result in the formation
of carbon dioxide via a direct two-electron-transfer pathway,7,8 while methanol oxidation is reported to undergo a six-electron-transfer
process at low overpotentials.32 For a
microdisk electrode, the equation for the expected diffusion limited
current is33  where n is the number of
electrons transferred, F is the Faraday constant
(96485 C mol–1), D is the diffusion
coefficient (6.5 × 10–11 m2 s–1 for formate34 and 4 ×
10–10 m2 s–1 for methanol35), C is the concentration of
formate or methanol, and re is the electrode
radius. Therefore, for 0.5 M formate or methanol, the theoretical
diffusion-limited currents at a Pd microelectrode with radius of 5.4
μm can be estimated as 1.4 × 10–7 and
2.5 × 10–6 A, respectively. However, the experimentally
measured oxidative peak currents of 0.5 M formate (2.2 × 10–9 A) and 0.5 M methanol (2.6 × 10–8 A) at a Pd microelectrode (r = 5.4 μm) (red
lines in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information)
are much smaller than the hypothetical diffusion-limited values, evidencing
that both the formate and methanol oxidation on Pd are surface reaction
rate limited processes, rather than transport controlled.

It
is worth mentioning that the modified GC electrode showed a
slightly higher peak current of formate oxidation (8.3 × 10–5 A) in the solution without the supporting electrolyte
NaClO4 (see Figure S2 in the
Supporting Information), indicating that the extremely high concentration
of formate used is able to be self-supporting during the measurement,
and suggests that some Pd active sites may be blocked
by ClO42–. Aqueous 5 M formate solution
was used in the following experiments.

3.2 CV of
a Carbon Microwire Electrode in Situ
Modified with a Dilute Coverage of Individual N-CNT-Pds
The
previous section reported the voltammetric response of a multilayered,
porous drop-cast surface. The interpretation of such a layer is complex
and is hard to analyze.13−16 In order to study the formate oxidation on adsorbed
but spatially well separated individual N-CNT-Pds, a carbon microwire
electrode (l ≈ 1 mm; d ≈
7 μm) was first treated with an in situ modification method
by dipping the wire electrode in a suspension of N-CNT-Pd (0.65 pM)
containing formate for 0.5 h, followed by a CV sweep. During the modification
process, about 100 individual N-CNT-Pds (see the Supporting Information) collided with and became immobilized
on the microwire electrode, giving an electrode modified with enough
N-CNT-Pd to give a clear formate oxidation signal in CV. For the wire
electrode used, one monolayer of N-CNT-Pds, assuming the CNTs are
perfectly tessellted on the electrode surface, would be 3.4 ×
104 CNTs (see the Supporting Information). Therefore, only 0.3% of the surface area is covered by 100 N-CNT-Pds,
which gives large spatial separation of N-CNT-Pds on the wire electrode
surface. No voltammetric response was detected when CV was recorded
immediately after the wire electrode was dipped in the suspension
of N-CNT-Pd (dashed lines in Figure 2A). After in situ modification in the formate solution
dispersed with N-CNT-Pd for 0.5 h, the wire electrode showed a Faradaic
current resulting from formate oxidation in the CV (solid lines in Figure 2A). Similar experiments
were conducted to study methanol oxidation in 1 M NaOH containing
10 M methanol. It was observed that a methanol oxidation signal was
also shown in the CV at the wire electrode after 1 h of in situ modification
in a suspension of N-CNT-Pd containing methanol (solid lines in Figure 2B).

Figure 2 (A) CV recorded immediately
after a carbon microwire electrode
(l ≈ 1 mm; d ≈ 7 μm)
was inserted in a 0.65 pM suspesion of N-CNT-Pd containing 5 M formate
(dashed line) and after the electrode was in situ modified in the
same solution for 30 min (solid line). Scan rate: 50 mV s–1. (B) CV recorded immediately after a carbon microwire electrode
was inserted in a 0.65 pM suspesion of N-CNT-Pd containing 1 M NaOH
+ 10 M methanol (dashed line) and after the electrode was in situ
modified in the same solution for 60 min (solid line). Scan rate:
50 mV s–1.

In sharp contrast to the clear oxidation peaks shown in the CV of the drop-cast experiments, the wire electrode
after in situ modification with N-CNT-Pd exhibits steady state currents at high overpotentials for both formate and methanol oxidation,
indicating that neither process is inhibited by Pd oxide formation
under these experimental conditions! Note that, for the CV of the
N-CNT-Pd modified wire electrode, current fluctuations, as shown in Figure 2, are variable due
to the different states of absorbed carbon nanotubes on the wire electrode
surface. Such Faradaic current fluctuations have been explained in
detail in a recent paper.36

3.3 Nanoimpacts of N-CNT-Pd
Nanoimpact
experiments of N-CNT-Pd were performed with the aim of separately
studying the formate and methanol oxidation on individual impacting
single N-CNT-Pd. To achieve this, a clean carbon microwire electrode
was first inserted in a suspension of N-CNT-Pd (0.65 pM) containing
5 M formate. Chronoamperograms were then recorded at a series of applied
potentials from −0.5 to +0.25 V vs SCE. Figure 3A shows a typical chronoamperogram at +0.2
V vs SCE where oxidative spikes are observed, evidencing the impact
of the individual carbon nanotubes. No spikes were detected at this
potential in the absence of N-CNT-Pd (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). A total number of 135 current spikes
at +0.2 V vs SCE were recorded, giving an average current of (4.1
± 1.5) × 10–11 A, and their height distribution
is shown in Figure 3B. The average duration of the spike is short, about 30 ms. This
short duration is possibly caused by the formation of CO2 gas bubbles on the palladium surface37 or due to adsorbed carbon intermediates, COad, produced
by the further reduction of CO2,38 leading to the deactivation of Pd active sites. The mean currents
of the individual spikes as a function of potential from nanoimpacts
of N-CNT-Pd are shown in Figure 3C, where it is observed that the average current at
potentials more positive than −0.2 V vs SCE shows a plateau
at around 40 pA. No spikes were detected at potentials more negative
than −0.4 V vs SCE (Figure S4 in
the Supporting Information). The average current from the spikes is
found to have an onset at the potentials at which formate oxidation
is observed in the CV (Figure 1A), evidencing that the detected current spikes correspond
to Faradaic currents associated with formate oxidation catalyzed by
the individual impacting N-CNT-Pd.

Figure 3 (A) Typical chronoamperogram obtained
at 0.2 V vs SCE for a carbon
microwire electrode in a 0.65 pM suspesion of N-CNT-Pd containing
5 M formate. (B) Height distribution of 135 current spikes at 0.2
V vs SCE. (C) Squares denoting the mean current of individual spikes

of formate oxidation at the wire electrode in situ modified with well-separated
N-CNT-Pd (black line) and nanoimpact analysis (red line) of formate
oxidation on individual impacting N-CNT-Pd.

By modeling the N-CNT-Pd as a cylindrical electrode (r = 6.5 × 10–8 m; l = 5 ×
10–6 m), for a mass transport controlled process,
the expected peak current on single N-CNT-Pd from the oxidation of
formate (5 M) can be estimated as 3.68 × 10–7 A. The average current of the spikes from formate oxidation is about
40 pA, which is significantly smaller than the expected peak current
(3.68 × 10–7 A) for a mass transport control
process. This further evidences that formate oxidation on individual
N-CNT-Pds is a surface reaction rate limited process, rather than
being under mass transport control. Moreover, from the drop-casting
experiments, the expected current of formate oxidation at a single N-CNT-Pd (ca. 5 μm in length, 130 nm in diameter)
can be estimated as 7.9 pA by directly dividing the peak current (8.3
× 10–5 A) (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) by the amount of drop-cast N-CNT-Pds
(1.05 × 107) (see the Supporting Information). This value of 7.9 pA is much less
than the average current (∼40 pA) detected from the nanoimpact
experiment. Therefore, the higher currents likely result from the
physical isolation of the carbon nanotubes in the impact experiment;
in contrast, the drop-cast material will inevitably form irregular
aggregated multilayers on the GC electrode surface.

In the nanoimpact
experiments, the collision of individual N-CNT-Pd
with the wire electrode creates extremely high mass transport conditions
for formate oxidation because of the small physical size of the individual
carbon nanotubes.28,29 Nanoimpact analysis shows that
the average current from formate oxidation on individual N-CNT-Pd
remains stable even at the high overpotentials. The stable oxidation
current is in agreement with the steady state current observed in
the in situ modification experiments (Figure 3D), further evidencing that under high mass
transport conditions Pd oxide formation is significantly inhibited,
and as a result higher electro-oxidation efficiency for formate was
achieved.

Nanoimpact experiments were also performed to detect
the signals
of methanol oxidation on individual N-CNT-Pds, but no spikes were
detected (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).
On the basis of the drop-casting expeiments, the expected current
from methanol oxidation on single N-CNT-Pd is calculated to be 1.3
pA. Although the average current from individual impacting N-CNT-Pds
might be several times larger than 1.3 pA in the nanoimpact experiments
according to the results of formate oxidation, it is still too small
to be detected due to the comparable background noise (∼20
pA) (Figure S5).

3.4 Comparison
and Inferences
We next
compare the CVs of formate oxidation and methanol oxidation on the
GC electrode drop-cast with N-CNT-Pd and their CVs at the wire electrode
modified with a dilute coverage of well separated N-CNT-Pd. A striking
difference is that a steady state current is observed
in both formate and methanol oxidation at spatially well separated
individual N-CNT-Pd, instead of the current peaks as shown in the CV response of the drop-cast N-CNT-Pd (Figure 4). Consequently,
it is concluded that, for well-separated individual N-CNT-Pd, the
palladium oxidation (eq 3) as a competitive reaction is significantly inhibited; hence, the
majority of Pd active sites on palladium nanoparticles remain active
even at highly oxidizing potentials. The Pd active sites therefore
continue to contribute to the catalysis of the formate or methanol
oxidation at high potentials (eqs 1 and 2): 1   2   3  It was reported previously that palladium
oxide formation was retarded in the presence of formic acid or methanol.10,39 Thus, a likely factor responsible for the observed steady state
current is that well-separated individual N-CNT-Pds absorbed on the
wire electrode surface experience very high mass transport conditions
for formate or methanol oxidation. This provides a basis for the preference
of formate or methanol oxidation during the competitive processes
with palladium oxidation. In contrast, an intermingled porous “mat”
of carbon nanotubes on the GC electrode is inevitably formed when
using the drop-cast technique. The resulting relatively limited mass
transport conditions for the oxidation of formate or methanol facilitate
the formation of the Pd oxide layer; probably the mass transport is
a mixture of linear semi-infinite diffusion and thin-layer transport.
For well-separated individual N-CNT-Pds, there are large numbers of
redox species around which create high mass transport conditions,
while an overlapping diffusion regime is formed on the “mat”
of N-CNT-Pds due to the confined volume of the available redox species.17−19,40,41 CVs similar to those seen with the drop-cast N-CNT-Pd were observed
when the carbon microwire electrode was inserted in a suspension of
N-CNT-Pds of an extremely high concentration (9.2 pM) (10 times higher
than that used in the in situ modification method) for about 10 s,
creating a higher population of large N-CNT-Pd ensembles which stick
to the wire electrode surface and are then transferred into the solution
containing formate or methanol to run a CV. As shown in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information, the
oxidation current falls off at high overpotentials in the CV of both
formate and methanol oxidation, further evidencing that current inhibition
by Pd oxide formation occurs on the large ensembles of the N-CNT-Pd.
It is also demonstrated that the voltammetric response of the N-CNT-Pd
toward formate or methanol oxidation can be easily tailored by using
different methods to modify the electrodes.

Figure 4 Comparison of cyclic
voltammograms of formate oxidation (A) and
methanol oxidation (B) on an N-CNT-Pd drop-cast GC electrode (black
lines) and a carbon microwire electrode in situ modified with well-separated
N-CNT-Pd (red lines).

Overall, Pd oxide formation and formate or methanol oxidation
are
two competitive processes. The inferior efficiency of formate and
methanol oxidation on Pd in their application to fuel cells is due
in part to the significant inhibition of Pd oxide formation toward
these oxidation processes. From the above comparison, it is seen that
Pd oxide formation as a competitive reaction can be retarded under
high mass transport conditions for formate and methanol oxidation,
which in this work was created on the well-separated catalyst N-CNT-Pd.
This highlights how the design of the catalyst in fuel cells and the
local mass transport conditions play an important role in the energy
conversion performance.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, we recorded and compared the voltammograms of formate/methanol
oxidation on drop-cast N-CNT-Pd and on wire electrodes modified with
well-separated individual N-CNT-Pd. It was found that the inhibition
from the Pd oxide formation on the oxidative processes on the drop-cast
N-CNT-Pd became retarded with the use of well-separated individual
N-CNT-Pd, where high mass transport conditions prevail. Further evidence
was seen in the study of formate oxidation on a single N-CNT-Pd via
the nanoimpact method, in which the oxidation process was also not
hindered by Pd oxidation at high overpotentials. The discovery of
the superior electrocatalytic performance under high mass transport
conditions suggests requirements for the design of fuel cell development
and offers the scope for new catalytic approaches to be developed.
