Oxidation
of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural into 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid is an important transformation for the production of bio-based
polymers. Carbon-supported gold catalysts hold great promise for this
transformation. Here we demonstrate that the activity, selectivity,
and stability of the carbon-supported gold nanoparticles in the oxidation
of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural strongly depend on the surface properties
of the carbon support. Gold nanoparticles supported on basic carbon
materials with a low density of functional groups demonstrate higher
activity in 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation (TOFAu up
to 1195 h–1), higher selectivity to 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid, and better stability in comparison to gold nanoparticles supported
on carbon materials with acidic surface groups. Surface groups of
basic carbon supports that are positively charged under the reaction
conditions result in a higher adsorption and local concentration of
hydroxyl ions, which act as cocatalysts for gold and enhance gold-catalyzed
dehydrogenation. Negatively charged surface groups of acidic carbons
repel hydroxyls and the intermediate monoacid anions, which leads
to lower reaction rates and a high selectivity toward 2,5-hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic
acid. Understanding the role of support surface charge and local hydroxyl
anion concentration provides a basis for the rational design of the
optimal carbon support surface chemistry for highly active, selective,
and stable catalysts for the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
and related reactions.

Introduction
Transformation of biomass into chemicals
represents a promising
way to reduce our society’s dependence on nonrenewable resources
as well as the environmental impact associated with the use of fossil
resources. Recent advances in the transformation of biomass polymers,
such as cellulose and hemicellulose, open novel possibilities for
obtaining value-added chemicals from renewable resources.1,2 For example, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a platform chemical
derived from sugars, contains hydroxymethyl and carbonyl groups which
can be oxidized to form various important furanic chemicals (Scheme 1), such as diformylfuran
(DFF), 2,5-hydroxymethylfurancarboxylic acid (HMFCA), 2,5-formylfurancarboxylic
acid (FFCA), and 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). FDCA has recently
attracted major interest because it can serve as a renewable alternative
to terephthalic acid in the production of polymers, a precursor in
organic synthesis, and a building block for metal–organic framework
materials.3

Scheme 1 Oxidation of HMF
to FDCA
Substantial progress
has been achieved in the conversion of HMF
to FDCA using air or molecular oxygen as an oxidant, catalyzed by
supported metal catalysts such as Au, Ru, Pt, Pd, and bimetallics
in aqueous media.4−9 In particular, supported gold catalysts have attacted considerable
interest due to their high activity in the oxidation of HMF to FDCA
and resistance to oxide formation, which is believed to be one of
the main causes of catalyst deactivation for other metals. The mechanism
of alcohol oxidation over supported metal catalysts in basic aqueous
media was investigated by Davis and co-workers.10−12 The results
indicate that water is the source of oxygen atoms in the products
of HMF oxidation, while dehydrogenation steps are catalyzed by hydroxyls
adsorbed on the Au surface. Molecular O2 closes the redox
cycle by removing negative charge formed during hydrogen abstraction
from the metal nanoparticles, thus regenerating the consumed hydroxyls.13

Carbon materials are promising catalyst
supports for metal nanoparticles,
in particular for fuel cell catalysts and catalysis in the aqueous
phase, due to their high stability in aqueous media over a broad pH
range, the possibility of full recovery of expensive metals via support
combustion, and the ease of surface functionalization by incorporating
other elements, such as oxygen and nitrogen.14,15 Various methods to introduce oxygen- or nitrogen-containing surface
functional groups have been employed.16−18 These functional groups
can be acidic, basic, or neutral (Figure 1), and their concentrations and strengths
determine the overall acidity/basicity of the material. The point
of zero charge (PZC) of carbon materials can be tuned over a broad
range. Carbon materials free of surface functional groups are known
to be hydrophobic/nonpolar; therefore, surface functionalization is
often required for the catalyst preparation to improve carbon surface
wetting properties and thus obtain catalysts with high metal loadings
and small particle sizes.18,15,19

possible functional groups on the surface of carbon materials.
Acidic groups are highlighted in red, and basic groups are highlighted
in blue.

Previous studies of carbon-supported
metal catalysts show that
carbon surface properties influence the size and distribution of supported
metal nanoparticles as well as catalyst performance, as was summarized
in an excellent review by Prati et al.20 However, in some cases it was not possible to ascribe the observed
catalytic effects to carbon surface properties exclusively, since
catalysts with different metal particle sizes and distributions were
compared. Colloidal nanoparticles are often used to obtain catalysts
with similar particle sizes irrespective of the support used.21,22 In some recent studies, details of which are given below, catalysts
prepared using metal colloids were used to investigate specifically
the effect of the surface properties in aqueous-phase oxidation reactions.

Oxidation
of Glycerol
Órfão and co-workers
studied the effect of the surface properties of activated carbon (AC)
and carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the activity of gold catalysts in the
oxidation of glycerol.23,24 The catalysts were prepared by
immobilizing preformed colloidal gold nanoparticles on AC and CNT
with different densities of oxygen-containing groups. Although the
size of the final supported nanoparticles varied from 4.4 to 12.5
nm, it was possible to conclude that catalysts supported on carbons
with a lower density of oxygen-containing groups were more active
than catalysts supported on carbons with a high density of oxygenated
groups.12 Catalyst deactivation due to
the growth of gold nanoparticles on both AC and CNT during glycerol
oxidation was reported. Prati et al. found that the activity and selectivity
of gold nanoparticles with similar sizes (2.9–4.6 nm) supported
on nitrogen-doped CNT and carbon nanofibers (CNF) in the oxidation
of glycerol increased with carbon basicity.25 Authors suggested that basic groups of the carbon support are involved
in the rate-limiting activation of the C–H bond. Selectivity
to C3 products was demonstrated to be higher for basic catalysts than
for acidic catalysts. The presence of hydrophilic oxygen-containing
groups was found to lead to the formation of H2O2, which cleaved the C–C bond, producing C2 and C1 products.

Oxidation of HMF
The performance of bimetallic AuPd
nanoparticles supported on CNT pretreated with either 30 or 68% HNO3 or 30% H2O2 was studied in HMF oxidation
under base-free conditions.26 It was found
that carbonyl/quinone and phenol functional groups facilitated adsorption
of HMF and intermediates on the catalyst, thus increasing the rate
of the oxidation steps, while carboxylic groups were detrimental to
the adsorption of HMF and intermediates onto the catalyst. However,
it was not specified whether the adsorption of HMF and intermediates
was on the metal nanoparticles or the support surface. A similar result
was obtained by the same group for Pt catalysts supported on a series
of CNT with different oxygen-containing functional groups.27 No explanation was given on why the particular
functional groups improve or suppress the adsorption of HMF or intermediates.
Besson et al. showed that introduction of oxygen-containing groups
on the surface of activated carbon and mesoporous carbon CMK-3 reduced
the activity of supported ruthenium nanoparticles in HMF oxidation.28 The observed decrease in activity was proposed
to be due to the increase in carbon hydrophilicity, resulting in the
competitive adsorption between water and substrate/intermediate molecules
on the support surface. Introduction of nitrogen-containing groups
showed either negative or no effect on catalyst activity. Davis and
co-workers observed that the yield of FDCA in HMF oxidation after
24 h was 62% in the presence of Au nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped
CNF-N and only 18% over Au nanoparticles supported on oxidized CNF
and carbon black (Cblack).11 Performing the reaction in the physical mixture of Au/Cblack and CNF-N gave the same result as that with Au/Cblack alone, indicating that gold nanoparticles should be supported on
CNF-N to produce a high yield of FDCA. The authors stated “at
this point, we cannot explain definitively the observed synergy of
Au on CNF-N for diacid formation but will continue to explore its
origins”.

The main aim of the present work was to understand
how and why the surface properties of carbon supports affect the activity
and selectivity of gold catalysts in HMF oxidation. Au particle growth
is often encountered under oxidative conditions in the liquid phase
but rarely studied.29−36 Therefore, investigation on how support surface properties affect
Au particle stability in oxidation reactions could provide insights
which will help mitigating deactivation of gold catalysts. We systematically
investigated a series of 2–4 nm gold nanoparticles supported
on high-surface-area graphite (HSAG) with different surface chemistries,
but the same morphology, in HMF oxidation under mildly basic conditions.
We demonstrate that the surface properties of the carbon supports
strongly affect the activity, selectivity, and stability of gold catalysts.

Experimental Section
Materials
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP,
MW 29000), NaBH4 (≥98%), HAuCl4 (>49.0%
Au), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF), furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic
acid (HMFCA) were purchased from SigmaAldrich. High-surface-area graphite
(HSAG, 500 m2/g, dpore 5.4
nm) was kindly provided by Timcal Ltd. Methanol (99+ %, extra pure)
was purchased from AcrosOrganics.

Carbon Modification
In order to modify surface properties
of HSAG, three different treatments have been applied. Oxidized HSAG
(HSAG-ox) was obtained by gas-phase oxidation with HNO3 vapor using the procedure and a setup described elsewhere.17 This treatment was reported to be highly effective
for the introduction of various oxygen-containing functional groups
on the surface of carbon nanotubes without significant change in their
textural properties. Briefly, heated quartz sample holder (150 °C)
containing 0.5 g of HSAG was connected to a reflux condenser and placed
on top of a 1 L round-bottom flask containing 150 mL of concentrated
nitric acid. The acid was heated to boiling, and the HSAG-ox was collected
after 5 min of treatment.

Since the surface of the pristine
HSAG already contained 5.6 atom % of oxygen (vide infra), reduction
treatment was applied to remove a fraction of oxygen-containing groups.
Hydrogen-treated HSAG (HSAG-H) was obtained by treating pristine HSAG
in a flow of 20% H2 in N2 at a rate of 100 mL/min
at 400 °C (heating rate 2 °C/min) for 12 h.

Finally,
amination treatment of carbon materials, i.e. treatment
with gaseous NH3, was applied in order to incorporate nitrogen-containing
functional groups on the carbon surface (HSAG-N) by treating the pristine
HSAG with gaseous NH3 at 600 °C and a total NH3 flow rate of 0.25 L/min.16

Catalyst
Preparation
PVP-stabilized colloidal Au nanoparticles
(SigmaAldrich, MW 29000, [PVP]monomer/[Au] = 10/1) were
synthesized by adding an appropriate amount of a freshly prepared
solution of NaBH4 (NaBH4/Au = 10/1) in 5 mL
of methanol to a methanol solution (20 mL) containing PVP and HAuCl4·3H2O. The resulting red solution was stirred
for 16 h to ensure complete decomposition of NaBH4,37 since sodium borohydride can reduce oxygen-containing
surface groups on carbon.38,39 Next, colloidal nanoparticles
were immobilized on supports by rapidly adding the colloid solution
to the support suspended in a small volume of methanol with vigorous
stirring. Methanol was used instead of typically employed water in
order to avoid inhomogeneous deposition of Au nanoparticles. Alcohols
have better interaction with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic carbon
materials and can improve metal adsorption on hydrophobic carbons.40,41 The amount of support material was adjusted to allow 1 wt % metal
loading. Typically, adsorption of colloidal particles on the surface
of the carbon material was achieved within 30 min, as evidenced by
the disappearance of the red color of the solution. The obtained solid
was recovered by centrifugation, washed several times with methanol
and diethyl ether, and subsequently dried at 60 °C overnight.
PVP was removed from supported Au nanoparticles by washing the catalyst
in an excess of Milli-Q water at room temperature overnight.42 Hence, no high-temperature treatments/reductions,
which could have altered the surface properties of HSAG materials,
have been employed. Gold nanoparticles supported on pristine HSAG
are denoted as Au/HSAG and the rest as Au/HSAG-x, where x indicates
the type of support treatment: ox, oxidation; H. reduction; N. amination.

Support and Catalyst Characterization
N2 physisorption
was performed at 77 K using a Micromeritics Tristar
3000 instrument. Prior to the measurement the samples were dried under
N2 flow at 200 °C for 20 h. Surface areas were calculated
using the BET method, and the pore size distribution was calculated
by analyzing the N2 adsorption branch of isotherms using
the BJH method. The BJH model was modified according to the Faas correction,
and the empirical form of the Harkins–Jura equation was considered
as a thickness reference curve. The total pore volume was calculated
as a single point pore volume at a P/P0 value of of 0.99. Acid–base titrations were performed
using a TitraLab pH meter. HSAG samples (10–50 mg) were suspended
in 65 mL of 0.1 M KCl solution. The suspension was degassed with N2 flow for 5 min with vigorous stirring, and titrations were
performed using either 0.01 M NaOH or 0.01 M HCl in 0.1 M KCl solutions.
Concentrations of basic/acidic sites on HSAG materials were calculated
from the equivalence point of titration curves. The points of zero
charge (PZC) of HSAG supports were determined using the mass titration
method.43 HSAG materials (1, 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 10 wt %) were suspended in 5 g of Milli-Q water, equilibrated
for 24 h under N2 bubbling; the pH of the solution was
measured using a PHM220 MeterLab instrument . PZC values for other
materials were measured using a single-point pH measurement: support
materials were suspended in Milli-Q water (10–20 wt %), and
the pH was measured after 24 h equilibration under N2.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Thermo
Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer equipped with a monochromated Al Kα
(hν = 1486.6 eV) X-ray source with a pass energy
of 200 eV and resolution 1 eV for survey spectra and 50 and 0.1 eV,
respectively, for high-resolution spectra. The peak binding energies
were calibrated against the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. Quantitative analysis
of XPS data was performed using the Casa XPS program. The main C 1s
peak of the sp2 carbon in the high-resolution C 1s spectra
was described using an asymmetric Doniach–Sunjic profile, while
the rest of the peaks (N 1s, O 1s, and C 1s peaks of functional groups
and shake-ups) were described with Gaussian–Lorentzian profiles
after subtracting a Shirley background. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was performed using a PerkinElmer Pyris 1TGA. Samples (5–10
mg) were heated in an Ar flow at a rate 5 °C/min up to 950 °C.

X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was performed using a Bruker-AXS
D2 Phaser X-ray diffractometer with Co Kα radiation (λ
= 1.79026 Å) operated at 30 kV and 10 mA. The average size of
Au crystallites was estimated using the Scherrer equation with a shape
factor k = 0.9 and line broadening analysis on the
Au 111 peak. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on a Tecnai12
instrument operating at 120 eV. Catalyst powders were suspended in
ethanol and deposited onto a carbon-coated Cu grid. Typically, at
least 300 particles were counted to calculate the average particle
diameter. Catalyst metal loadings were determined using inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) performed on a ThermoFisher
Scientific Element 2 instrument. Known amounts of Au/HSAG catalyst
samples (10–20 mg) were loaded onto calcination boats and heated
to 800 °C (10 °C/min heating rate) in static air to remove
the carbon support. The remaining Au was dissolved with freshly prepared
aqua regia. The obtained solution was transferred to a volumetric
flask and diluted with Milli-Q water, and the Au concentration was
measured using ICP-MS.

Catalyst Testing and Adsorption Experiments
Oxidation
of HMF was performed in stainless steel autoclaves with a total volume
of 12 mL. Typically, 25 mg of a catalyst was suspended in 7 mL of
deionized water containing 0.2 mmol of HMF and 0.4 mmol of NaHCO3. Reactors were heated to 90 °C and pressurized with
10 bar of O2 with vigorous stirring (900 rpm). Samples
of the reaction mixture were withdrawn, filtered with 0.2 μm
PTFE filters, diluted with water, and analyzed using a Shimadzu LC-20AD
high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a Bio-Rad Aminex
HPX-87H column. Sulfuric acid (5 mM) at 333 K with a flow rate of
0.55 mL/min was used as an eluent. Each catalyst was tested at least
twice to check reproducibility. Turnover frequencies (h–1) were calculated as  where k is the rate constant
obtained from the fitting of the HMF conversion kinetic curves (first
order kinetics), C0 is the initial concentration
of HMF, and nAu is the total number of
moles of surface gold.

For the study of the adsorption of HMF
and HMFCA on Au/HSAG-x catalysts, 50 mg of a catalyst was suspended
in 5 mL of an aqueous solution containing HMF/HMFCA (25 μmol)
and NaHCO3 (pH 8.5). The suspension was sonicated and further
kept for 3 h without stirring. Next, Au/HSAG was filtered off and
a 1 mL aliquot of the solution was mixed with 20 μL of 0.23
M dioxane (external standard) solution in water. The concentration
of HMF in the obtained solutions was analyzed using high-performance
liquid chromatography.

Results
Modification of High-Surface-Area
Graphite
The surface
atomic compositions of pristine high-surface-area graphite (HSAG)
as well as oxidized (HSAG-ox), reduced (HSAG-H), and aminated (HSAG-N)
calculated from peak areas of the X-ray photoelectron survey spectra
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information)
are summarized in Table 1. The pristine HSAG possesses a pronounced O 1s peak at 530 eV corresponding
to the presence of 5.6% of surface oxygen in the form of oxygen-containing
functional groups. An increase in the atomic surface concentration
of oxygen from 5.6% to 12.6% was observed after a 5 min treatment
of HSAG with hot HNO3 vapor (HSAG-ox), confirming further
introduction of oxygen-containing species. The surface atomic concentration
of oxygen decreased to 3.3% after the thermal treatment in a H2/N2 flow at 400 °C (HSAG-H) due to the decomposition
of thermally unstable O groups. Finally, upon treatment with gaseous
ammonia (HSAG-N) nitrogen-containing surface species form at the expense
of oxygen species; only 1.2 and 0.9% of oxygen and nitrogen, respectively,
were detected on the surface of HSAG-N. The high temperature of the
amination treatment explains why only a small number of the most thermally
stable oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups remain on the surface
of HSAG-N.14,44

The nature and relative amounts of
the surface functional groups
were established by analyzing high-resolution spectra of C 1s and
N 1s bands (Figure 2 and Table 2). It
is generally accepted that the C 1s peak in oxygen-containing carbons
can be deconvoluted with the following components: peak at 284.5–284.6
eV due to sp2-hybridized carbon, peak at 286.1–286.3
eV due to carbon bound to oxygen with a single bond (C–O, ethers
and phenols), peak at 287.4–287.7 eV due to carbonyl groups
(C=O, quinones and ketones), peak at 288.6–290.0 eV
due to carbon bound to two oxygens (O=C–O, carboxyls,
lactones, and esters), and shakeup satellites of carbon in aromatic
systems at 290.5 and 292 eV.18,44,45

HSAG-H	83.9	5.3	2.9	3.2	4.7

When both oxygen- and nitrogen-containing
functionalities are present
on the surface of the carbon material, the contributions from C–N
and C–O overlap in the region 285–290 eV, making C 1s
spectra extremely complex; therefore, no deconvolution of the C 1s
spectrum of HSAG-N was performed. Figure 2 and Table 2 show that functional groups comprising a C–O
bond are dominant among the oxygen-containing groups on the surface
of the pristine HSAG. After thermal treatment under H2/N2 flow concentrations of all oxygen-containing surface species
had decreased due to thermal decomposition.14 After HSAG oxidation with HNO3 the vapor relative concentration
of COO– groups increased from 3.8 to 6.1%, indicating the incorporation
of a large number of carboxyl, lactone, and ester groups. The relative
concentration of C–O groups increased from 5.8 to 6.7%, while
the concentration of C=O groups showed a slight decrease from
3.2 to 2.6%, which could be due to the partial conversion of the C=O
groups into COO– groups upon HNO3 treatment.

Deconvolution of the high-resolution N 1s spectrum of HSAG-N (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) showed
that N-containing species consisted primarily of pyridinic groups.
Other groups included quaternary, pyrrolic, and N-oxide species. Thus,
XPS characterization shows that a range of HSAG materials with distinctly
different oxygen contents and natures of functional groups had been
prepared.

Information about the amount of thermally removable
groups of HSAG
materials was obtained from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). HSAG-ox
showed the highest (ca. 12%) overall weight loss upon heating within
the temperature range 200–950 °C under an inert atmosphere,
while HSAG, HSAG-H, and HSAG-N demonstrated lower weight loss values
of 10, 6, and 3.7 wt %, respectively. The trend in the weight loss
qualitatively agrees with the HSAG-x oxygen content determined from
XPS.

The acid–base properties of HSAG materials were
studied
by determining their points of zero charge (PZC) and concentrations
of acid/base sites. The results of the PZC determination of HSAG materials
using the mass titration method (Figure 3A and Table 3) show that the acidity of HSAG materials correlates
with the oxygen content: the PZC of HSAG-x materials increases in
the order HSAG-ox < HSAG < HSAG-H < HSAG-N. The pristine
HSAG is acidic with a PZC value of 4.0. The acidity of the pristine
HSAG originates from the surface groups, such as carboxyls, phenols,
and lactones, located on the inner pore walls of HSAG as determined
from the XPS data. HSAG-ox is more acidic with a PZC value of 2.6
due to strongly acidic functional groups introduced by the HNO3 treatment. HSAG-H is mildly basic with a PZC value of 7.7.
Since acidic oxygen-containing groups (carboxylic, lactone) are thermally
less stable than basic groups (quinone, pyrone, chromene), they decompose
preferentially at lower temperature under a reducing atmosphere, thus
increasing the surface basicity.14 HSAG-N
demonstrates the highest basicity of this series with a PZC value
of 9.9. The basicity of HSAG-N originates from pyridinic and pyrrolic
groups as well as delocalized π electrons of the graphene sheets.16,46 These results show that the PZC of HSAG can be varied within a broad
range (2.6–9.9) by surface functionalization.

The concentrations
of acidic and basic groups on HSAG surfaces
were established using acid/base titration. The initial pH values
of the titration curves (Figure 3B) also showed that HSAG and HSAG-ox were acidic, while
HSAG-H and HSAG-N were (mildly) basic. The apparent concentrations
of surface acidic and basic sites of HSAG materials are given in Table 3.

N2 physisorption results (Table 3) show that there were no major changes in
the surface area, pore size, or pore volume of HSAG during the employed
treatments. A small decrease in the surface area and pore volume of
HSAG-ox in comparison to those of the pristine HSAG can be attributed
to the textural damage during the oxidation treatment. Graphitic carbon
materials free of surface functional groups are hydrophobic.41 It is well-known that the presence of polar
surface groups, e.g. oxygen- or nitrogen-containing groups, increases
carbon hydrophilicity. Therefore, the hydrophilicity of HSAG materials
is expected to decrease in the order HSAG-ox > HSAG > HSAG-H
≈
HSAG-N.

In summary, a range of HSAG materials with similar morphologies
but different surface properties, i.e. surface elemental composition,
nature and concentration of functional groups, and acid–base
and hydrophilic properties, have been prepared. These materials were
used as supports to deposit gold colloids.

Au Deposition on HSAG-x
Figure 4 shows representative
TEM micrographs of
Au/HSAG-x catalysts and the corresponding particle size distribution
histograms. The size of the gold colloid before immobilization was
2.3 ± 0.8 nm (Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information). The results show that spherical gold nanoparticles with
sizes of 2–4 nm are uniformly distributed over the surface
of the HSAG supports. The size of the supported Au particles is slightly
larger than that of the original gold colloids, especially when the
particles are immobilized on HSAG materials with higher oxygen content.
For the most basic material HSAG-N with the lowest oxygen content
the size and size distribution of gold particles did not change upon
deposition. These results indicate that basic carbon materials can
better stabilize the size of supported particles deposited from colloidal
solution, which is in agreement with previous reports.25 Results of XRD analysis (Table 4) agreed well with the results of the TEM
study, and no large Au crystallites were detected. Au loadings were
close to the target value of 1 wt % in all cases.

Oxidation
of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural
We first investigated
the activity of Au-free HSAG supports in the oxidation of HMF using
NaHCO3 as a base. It was recently reported that metal-free
nitrogen-doped carbon materials can demonstrate some activity in the
aerobic oxidation of alcohols.47 Our results
show that the concentration of HMF in the reaction mixture decreased
by up to ca. 15% in 12 h; however, no HMFCA, FDCA, or any other products
formed. This decrease in the concentration is due to HMF adsorption
onto the porous HSAG-x (see below). The 15% decrease in HMF concentration
corresponds to a surface coverage of ∼1.4 HMF molecule/nm2 of HSAG. Therefore, we concluded that metal-free HSAG supports
are inactive in HMF oxidation but strongly adsorb it.

Au/HSAG-x
catalysts were active in the oxidation of HMF under mildly basic conditions
(pH 8–8.5, NaHCO3 base). HMFCA is the main intermediate,
and DFF does not form in the presence of gold catalysts, while FFCA
is quickly converted into FDCA and therefore its concentration is
close to zero during the reaction, in line with previous reports.6,12,26,48,49 No activity was observed when NaHCO3 was not added to the reaction.

Figure 5 shows reaction
profiles of HMF oxidation in the presence of Au/HSAG-x. Conversion
of HMF is well described by first-order kinetics. Gold nanoparticles
supported on basic carbon materials were more active in both conversion
of HMF into HMFCA and further conversion of HMFCA to FDCA in comparison
to the catalysts supported on acidic carbons. In the presence of Au/HSAG-ox
the reaction did not reach full HMF conversion and no FDCA was detected
even after 40 h. Gold nanoparticles supported on acidic HSAG were
most selective toward HMFCA formation (>90% selectivity). Although
the initial gold particle sizes differ slightly within the Au/HSAG
series, differences in activity cannot be explained by the difference
in the specific gold surface area. TOF values normalized to the surface
Au for HMF conversion and the normalized rate of FDCA formation are
shown in Table 5. The
highest TOF value of ca. 1195 h–1 was achieved for
Au/HSAG-N, while the lowest TOF value of 25 h–1 was
observed for Au/HSAG-ox. The catalyst activity clearly increases with
the PZC value of the support (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, we conclude that the
observed differences are due to the different surface properties of
HSAG-x supports.

Au Particle Stability
Details on
the Au particle/crystallite
sizes before and after HMF oxidation are given in Table 6. We observed growth of 2–4
nm Au particles into larger monocrystalline particles during HMF oxidation
on all four HSAG supports. Particles grew less on more basic HSAG.
The Au crystallite growth was irrespective of whether HMF was added
or not (Table 6). Hence,
particle growth is not induced by the catalytic process itself but
rather by the exposure to the reaction conditions involving high temperatures
and aqueous media at basic pH.

Growth
of metal nanoparticles can occur via two main mechanisms.
First, particles can diffuse over the surface as a whole and coalesce
with other particles. Second, metal particles can release coordinated
metal species which diffuse and add to the larger particles (Ostwald
ripening).50,51 From Table 6 it is clear that the presence of oxygen-containing
groups on the surface of carbon support facilitates Au particle growth.
It is was previously observed that surface oxygen groups can assist
Au particle growth.52 The presence of oxygen
groups near gold nanoparticles can decrease the degree of adhesion
of Au nanoparticles to the support53 and
thus allow for better mobility of Au nanoparticles.54 Alternatively, oxygen surface groups can facilitate the
formation and movement of oxidized mobile Au species. The investigation
of the exact mechanism of the growth of Au nanoparticles under oxidative
conditions in the liquid phase is beyond the scope of this work and
is the topic of an ongoing investigation. However, we can conclude
that the poor Au particle stability in aqueous-phase HMF oxidation
can be related to oxygen-containing groups on the carbon support surface.

Discussion
Origin of Different Activity/Selectivity of Au/HSAG-x
Here Au/HSAG-x catalysts were investigated in HMF oxidation in the
presence of NaHCO3. The highest achieved TOF value of HMF
conversion was 1195 h–1 for Au/HSAG-N, which is
ca. 7–15 times lower than the values reported previously for
carbon-supported gold catalysts.6,11 This is because a milder
base (NaHCO3) was used in this work as opposed to the NaOH
typically used for HMF oxidation. Strongly alkaline conditions were
previously shown to be undesirable for HMF oxidation because of the
poor stability of HMF at high pH. Besson et al. demonstrated that
HMF rapidly degraded to 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) and levulinic
and formic acids as well as insoluble humins in the presence of NaOH
(pH 13) and Na2CO3 (pH 11.5) at 100 °C
and 40 bar of air, while no HMF degradation was observed in the presence
of the mild base NaHCO3.9 Davis
et al. observed the formation of up to 13% of BHMF byproduct, induced
by high concentration of the NaOH base, while no BHMF byproduct was
observed in our study, most likely due to the mild pH. Comparison
of Au/HSAG-N with Pt/C in the presence of NaHCO3 base (100
°C, 40 bar of air, HMF/Pt = 100, NaHCO3/HMF = 4)55 shows that Au/HSAG-H is ca. 5 times more active
in HMF oxidation than carbon-supported Pt catalyst, despite the milder
conditions used for HMF oxidation in the presence of Au/HSAG-N. These
results indicate that Au catalysts supported on basic carbon materials
are promising catalysts for highly selective HMF oxidation to FDCA
under mildly basic conditions.

The mechanism of HMF oxidation
over supported gold catalysts in basic aqueous media was investigated
by Davis et al. (Scheme 2).12 As seen from Scheme 2, hydroxyls play an important role in HMF
oxidation. OH– ions catalyze the formation of geminal
diols from aldehyde and water (Scheme 2, steps 1 and 4). Furthermore, OH– ions adsorbed on the gold surface or at the gold–support
interface abstract hydrogen from C–H and O–H groups
of alcohol or geminal diol to yield carbonyl and carboxylic groups,
respectively (Scheme 2, steps 2, 3, and 5).10 While the formation
of geminal diols can be catalyzed by OH– in solution,
dehydrogenation steps are catalyzed by hydroxyls adsorbed on the surface
(or in the close vicinity) of gold, since electron density formed
as a result of hydrogen abstraction present on the gold nanoparticles.
The electrons are then scavenged by oxygen to regenerate the hydroxyls
(Scheme 2, steps 2,
3, and 5, right side).

Scheme 2 Overall Mechanism of HMF Oxidation to FDCA
Adapted from Davis et
al.12
In this work HMF oxidation was performed under mildly
basic conditions.
The pH of the reaction mixture was 8.0–8.5 before the catalytic
reaction start and 7.5–8.0 after 12 h. The drop in pH is due
to base neutralization with the formed HMFCA and FDCA acids.

When the pH of solution is lower than the PZC value of a suspended
solid, surface groups become protonated and therefore the surface
of the material is positively charged.56 If pH of the solution is higher than the PZC value, a part of the
surface groups becomes deprotonated and the surface is negatively
charged. Therefore, the surface of HSAG and HSAG-ox (PZC 2.6–4.0)
was negatively charged during the reaction, while the surface of basic
materials, HSAG-H and HSAG-N (PZC 7.7–9.9), was either neutral
or slightly positively charged.

On the basis of the proposed
reaction mechanism and catalyst characterization
results, we can tentatively give the following explanations of the
observed differences between acidic and basic Au/HSAG-x catalysts.

First, acidic HSAGs are highly hydrophilic. As was previously suggested
by Besson et al.,28 higher hydrophilicity
of the support material results in a stronger adsorption of water
molecules on the support surface, which compete for the adsorption
sites with the HMF substrate and HMFCA intermediate. Table S1 in the Supporting Information shows HMF and HMFCA
adsorption on Au/HSAG-x and pure HSAG-x supports. The lowest adsorption
of both HMF and HMFCA is observed for the most acidic support HSAG-ox
and Au/HSAG-ox. However, the difference in the adsorption values of
HMF is not significant enough to explain the 50-fold difference in
the activity within the Au/HSAG-x series.

A second possible
reason is the different stabilities of Au nanoparticles
on acidic and basic HSAG. The lower stability of gold nanoparticles
on acidic HSAG supports results in a faster decrease in the active
Au surface area. Since Au particles grow to larger sizes on acidic
HSAG, we calculated TOF values considering the final size of gold
nanoparticles in order to find out if the observed lower activity
of the acidic catalysts could be solely related to the more pronounced
particle growth (Table S2 in the Supporting
Information). The results show that, even assuming that particles
grow instantaneously to the final size, the most basic Au/HSAG-N is
still ca. 37 times more active than Au/HSAG-ox. From Table 6 it is clear that particles
do not grow instantaneously. This result suggests that the stability
difference of gold nanoparticles on different supports is not the
reason for the observed differences in activity.

This means
that the difference in activity must be mainly related
to the charge of carbon supports with acidic and basic groups. There
are two possible ways in which surface charge of carbon supports could
affect the activity of gold nanoparticle catalysts in HMF oxidation.
The positively charged surface of basic carbons facilitates adsorption
of OH– ions onto the surface of the catalyst support
in the close vicinity of gold nanoparticles: i.e., at the gold–support
interface (Figure 6A). Since gold catalyzes dehydrogenation (Scheme 2) only in the presence of adsorbed OH–, more adsorption of OH– and therefore
a higher local concentration of OH– in the near
vicinity of gold for basic carbons result in an increase in the rates
of dehydrogenation to yield HMFCA, FFCA, and FDCA (Scheme 2, steps 2, 3, and 5). Negatively
charged groups on the surface of acidic carbons repel OH– ions, which results in a reduction of the rates of the hydrogen
abstraction steps (Figure 6C). This scenario is valid and causes considerable difference
between the activities of acidic/basic supports for the active sites
located at the periphery of gold nanoparticles (metal–support
interface).

Figure 6 Two possible scenarios of how acidic or basic surface groups on
the carbon support can affect the adsorption of OH–. Hydroxyls adsorbed on gold nanoparticles or at the gold–support
interface are necessary for efficient hydrogen abstraction in steps
2, 3, and 5 in Scheme 2. Acidic or basic groups can affect adsorption of OH– on the support near the metal–support interface (A, C) or
transfer charge to gold nanoparticles, which affects adsorption of
ions on the gold (B, D).

In the second scenario, surface charge can be transferred
from
the carbon support to gold nanoparticles, making them fractionally
charged either positively in the case of basic surface groups (Figure 6B) or negatively
in the case of supports with acidic surface groups (Figure 6D). The positively charged
Au nanoparticles attract OH– ions, which results
in an increase in dehydrogenation activity. This case is valid for
all Au active sites and not necessarily sites located close to the
metal–support interface. The two scenarios described above
are not mutually exclusive: i.e., both can be realized at the same
time. Detecting a fractional charge change induced by the support
for 3 nm gold nanoparticles is difficult, because support surface
charge is generated in situ depending on the pH of the solution; therefore,
special in situ catalyst characterization would be required. Moreover,
the charge induced in the 3 nm gold nanoparticles is shared among
∼800–900 constituent Au atoms and is therefore difficult
to detect, yet it might have a non-negligible effect on the catalyst
activity.

The high selectivity toward HMFCA for catalysts supported
on acidic
HSAG is likely due to the deprotonated (anionic) form of HMFCA under
the reaction conditions (the pKa value
of HMFCA is 3.1, reaction pH >7.5). Therefore, HMFCA anions are
repelled
by the negatively charged groups (0.16–0.54 nm–1) of acidic HSAG supports or negative charge on gold nanoparticles,
preventing their further oxidation to FDCA. On the other hand, the
positively charged surface of basic carbons or positive charge of
gold nanoparticles facilitate adsorption of HMFCA anions on/to the
vicinity of gold nanoparticles, thus promoting their further conversion.
This explanation is supported by the fact that HMFCA is adsorbed >6
times less on Au/HSAG-ox than on Au/HSAG-N (Table S1 in the Supporting Information), which can be due to the
difference in electrostatic interaction. Therefore, Au catalysts supported
on acidic oxidized carbon supports can be used for highly selective
synthesis of HMFCA from HMF.

The improved adsorption of HMFCA
and hydroxyl anions might also
explain the high FDCA yield for the basic Au/CNF-N observed in the
work by Davis et al.11 Wang et al. observed
that the presence of carbonyl/quinone groups on carbon nanotubes (CNT)
supports improved the yield of FDCA, while carboxylic groups on CNT
were detrimental.26 Quinone groups are
known to be basic, and carbonyl groups are often constituents of other
types of basic functional groups (e.g., pyrone), explaining the improved
adsorption of HMF and intermediates observed in the work. On the other
hand, the acidic and more hydrophilic nature of carboxylic groups
accounts for the reduced adsorption/activity for the catalysts with
surfaces rich in carboxylic groups.

Conclusions
A
relationship between the surface properties of carbon supports
and the performance of gold nanoparticles supported on these carbon
materials in the oxidation of HMF under mildly basic conditions has
been established. The activity of Au/HSAG-x in HMF oxidation and the
selectivity toward FDCA increase with support basicity, reaching a
TOF value of 1195 h–1 for HMF conversion for the
most basic catalyst support. In contrast, gold nanoparticles supported
on acidic carbons with a high density (up to 0.54 nm2)
of oxygen functional groups showed much lower activities (25 h–1 for the most acidic) and a high selectivity (>90%)
toward the intermediate monoacid HMFCA. The stability of the supported
gold nanoparticles is affected by the surface chemical composition:
particles supported on basic carbons with low densities of surface
functional groups show good stability, while oxygen-containing surface
groups facilitate particle growth.

The differences in catalytic
activity and selectivity between gold
nanoparticles supported on acidic and basic carbon supports are proposed
to be mainly due to the differences in the adsorption of hydroxyls
and charged reaction intermediates. Hydroxyl anions adsorbed on gold
nanoparticles or at the metal–support interface are essential
for hydrogen abstraction from alcohol and geminal diol groups, leading
to the formation of carbonyl and carboxylic groups, respectively.
We propose that surface groups of basic carbon supports (HSAG-H and
HSAG-N), which are charged positively under the reaction conditions,
either facilitate efficient adsorption of hydroxyls OH– at the gold–support interface or induce (fractional) positive
charge in gold nanoparticles, which leads to more efficient adsorption
of hydroxyls on the Au surface. For acidic carbon supports the opposite
scenario is true: hydroxyl anions are repelled from the negatively
charged support surface or gold nanoparticles, which leads to a reduction
in dehydrogenation rates. Positively charged surface groups also facilitate
adsorption of the deprotonated intermediate monoacid HMFCA at the
gold–support interface or gold surface, promoting its further
conversion and thus increasing the yield of FDCA. In contrast, the
negatively charged surface of acidic carbons HSAG and HSAG-ox or gold
particles repel HMFCA anions, which results in high selectivity toward
HMFCA.

These findings set design rules for gold catalysts that
are highly
active in HMF oxidation and selective toward FDCA: one should use
supports that are positively charged under the reaction conditions.
In contrast, to obtain catalysts that are highly selective toward
the intermediate monoacid HMFCA, supports that are negatively charged
under the reaction conditions with a high density of surface functional
groups should be employed.
