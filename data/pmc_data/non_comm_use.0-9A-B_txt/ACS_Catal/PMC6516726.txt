Many enzymes that
catalyze hydride transfer reactions work via
a mechanism dominated by quantum mechanical tunneling. The involvement
of fast vibrational modes of the reactive complex is often inferred
in these reactions, as in the case of the NAD(P)H-dependent pentaerythritol
tetranitrate reductase (PETNR). Herein, we interrogated the H-transfer
mechanism in PETNR by designing conservative (L25I and I107L) and
side chain shortening (L25A and I107A) PETNR variants and using a
combination of experimental approaches (stopped-flow rapid kinetics,
X-ray crystallography, isotope/temperature dependence studies of H-transfer
and NMR spectroscopy). X-ray data show subtle changes in the local
environment of the targeted side chains but no major structural perturbation
caused by mutagenesis of these two second sphere active site residues.
However, temperature dependence studies of H-transfer revealed a coenzyme-specific
and complex thermodynamic equilibrium between different reactive configurations
in PETNR–coenzyme complexes. We find that mutagenesis of these
second sphere “noncatalytic” residues affects differently
the reactivity of PETNR with NADPH and NADH coenzymes. We attribute
this to subtle, dynamic structural changes in the PETNR active site,
the effects of which impact differently in the nonequivalent reactive
geometries of PETNR−NADH and PETNR−NADPH complexes.
This inference is confirmed through changes observed in the NMR chemical
shift data for PETNR complexes with unreactive 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-NAD(P)
analogues. We show that H-transfer rates can (to some extent) be buffered
through entropy–enthalpy compensation, but that use of integrated
experimental tools reveals hidden complexities that implicate a role
for dynamics in this relatively simple H-transfer reaction. Similar
approaches are likely to be informative in other enzymes to understand
the relative importance of (distal) hydrophobic side chains and dynamics
in controlling the rates of enzymatic H-transfer.

Introduction
Understanding
the physical basis of enzyme catalysis is important
from a fundamental point of view and also to drive applications in
contemporary areas of research, such as biotechnology and synthetic
biology. The development of sustainable and clean chemical manufacturing
practices requires deep appreciation of the physical basis of enzyme
catalysis that enables us to mimic and improve Nature’s catalysts.
Enzymes catalyze many chemical reactions with extraordinary selectivity
and specificity and, in some cases, extreme efficiency.1−3 While it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the catalytic
effect for even one particular enzyme, the importance of electrostatic
contributions,4 i.e., stabilization of
the transition state and hydrogen bonding,5 has long been recognized. Diverse experimental and theoretical methods
have been used to probe chemical steps and have contributed to debates
relating to physical models of catalysis, in some cases moving beyond
traditional semiclassical frameworks for enzyme catalysis.6−9 A fast-growing number of experimental studies indicate that protein
dynamics might play a role in catalysis, across a hierarchy of time
scales.10−14 Beyond experimental approaches, the involvement of dynamics has
been supported also by computation.15−19 Slower (microsecond to millisecond) dynamics attributed
to large-scale protein domain motions have been identified using NMR
methodologies. Direct coupling of fast (femtosecond to nanosecond)
dynamics to chemistry is mostly inferred from kinetic isotope effect
(KIE) studies and supported by computational analysis such as transition
path sampling.20−22 The temperature dependence of KIEs is regarded as
a “gold standard” for probing quantum mechanical tunneling
(QMT) for H-transfer reactions and some interpretations have inferred
a role for distance sampling dynamical contributions in facilitating
the tunneling reaction23−27 (although others have questioned these models28−30). Studies with
variant enzymes have led to models in which the temperature dependence
of the KIE has been attributed to modulation of donor–acceptor
distance (DAD) distributions and perturbation of high-frequency motions31 or disruption of dynamic networks32 that extend to remote residues within the enzyme.
Mutagenesis has been used to perturb active site structure and probe
effects on H-transfer and inferred dynamical contributions using a
number of enzyme systems (e.g., dihydrofolate reductase,33 soybean lipoxygenase-1,34 thymidylate synthase,35 ene-reductases36). Experimental KIE measurements have also been
extended to include the use of high pressure37,38 and “heavy enzymes” (2H, 13C,
and/or 15N stable isotope-labeled)39−44 to probe these effects further and supported using computational
simulations. Much of our current understanding of enzymatic catalysis
has come from probing the effects of mutagenesis on catalytic rates
and from computational simulations. For H-transfer reactions, this
has opened up debates on the relative importance of dynamics in these
reactions and challenged the community to develop integrated experimental45 and theoretical22 approaches to address this problem.

Old Yellow Enzymes (OYEs)
are an intensively investigated class
of ene-reductases, which catalyze the asymmetric reduction of a wide
variety of activated α,β-unsaturated compounds, with high
specificity for substrates bearing nitro or keto groups.46 While their physiological role and natural substrates
are often not known,47 OYEs are particularly
attractive to study from a mechanistic perspective and for their biocatalytic
potential. Pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase (PETNR) is one such
enzyme. PETNR has dual-specificity and is reduced by both NADH and
NADPH, but with a preference toward the latter coenzyme.48 The basis of this dual-specificity is not well
understood. The catalytic cycle of PETNR follows a single-site ping-pong
mechanism. The first step (the reductive half-reaction) involves hydride
transfer from the C4 pro-R hydrogen atom of the NAD(P)H
coenzyme to the N5 atom of the noncovalently bound flavin mononucleotide
(FMN) cofactor.49 QMT contributes to this
catalytic step,43 and several experimental
studies have suggested an involvement of fast (picosecond to nanosecond)
dynamics in the H-transfer reaction.23,50,51 Here, we interrogated the H-transfer mechanism in
PETNR by designing four variants of two second sphere residues (L25
and I107) positioned along the FMN-NAD(P)H N5–C4 axis (Figure 1), as inferred from
the structure of PETNR in complex with the unreactive NADH analogue
1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-NAD.43 L25 is located
below the FMN, with the side chain in van der Waals contact with the
isoalloxazine ring of the FMN cofactor, while the side chain of I107
is positioned above the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme. These residues
are “noncatalytic” and are assumed not to contribute
to major active site electrostatic effects. We have altered these
residues by making conservative (L25I and I107L) and side chain length
shortening (L25A and I107A) variants of PETNR, with the objective
of understanding how second sphere residues influence catalysis, H-tunneling
and any vibrational modes linked to H-transfer. We used X-ray crystallography
to assess the impact of mutagenesis on overall structural properties
and stopped-flow spectroscopy to analyze the kinetics of hydride transfer
through a combination of concentration and temperature dependence
studies with both coenzymes (NADPH and NADH). Building on the recent
NMR work in which a full sequential backbone assignment of PETNR holoenzyme
was undertaken,52 we also used the coenzyme
analogues 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-NAD(P) (NAD(P)H4) to investigate
coenzyme binding modes in the ground-state PETNR−NADPH4 and PETNR−NADH4 complexes. Our overall
aim was to understand how localized dynamics can impact H-transfer
in each of these complexes and to investigate how perturbation of
second sphere residues through mutagenesis impacts QMT and active
site dynamics associated with this reaction with both NADPH and NADH.

I107 (blue), which have been targeted for mutagenesis. Residues located
5 Å away from the NADH4 C4-H are represented as wireframes
in the right panel of the figure. Residue L25 is located ∼
4 Å away from the FMN cofactor (yellow), with the side chain
pointing directly below the H-transfer coordinate, while I107 is located
∼8 Å above the coenzyme site (green) and is positioned
above two bulky side chains (Y68 and Y186) that form one side of the
active site hydrophobic cavity.

Results and Discussion
First, to ensure that mutagenesis
of PETNR had not influenced the
coordination of the noncovalently bound FMN cofactor, we recorded
UV–vis absorption spectra of the PETNR variants. All variants
displayed the same spectroscopic features as wild-type PETNR (WT PETNR),
with full FMN occupancy in the active site, and maintaining the characteristic
PETNR-bound FMN spectral signature, with maxima at 380 and 465 nm
(Figure S1 and Table S1). To assess any
impact of mutagenesis on the general structure of the enzyme, we determined
X-ray crystallographic structures for all variant forms isolated (Figures S2–S3 and Table S2). When compared
to WT PETNR (PDB: 3P62), the RMSD values based on Cα positions corresponding to each
variant were in the range 0.3–0.4 Å, indicating a high
degree of similarity. No major reorientations occurred in the loops
bearing the side chain mutations, and superpositioning of all the
structures indicates the tertiary TIM-barrel fold and external secondary
features were largely unaffected by mutagenesis. Despite the overall
structures of each of the four variants remaining largely unperturbed
by mutagenesis, some subtle shifts in side chains are observed. One
key shift in the I107A variant has led to a reorientation of the side
chain of Q241 (highlighted in Figure S2). Removal of the I107 side chain bulk allows the side chain of Q241
to rotate toward the vacated space, leading to a slight increase in
the coenzyme binding pocket in this region. Altogether, the spectroscopic
and structural evidence supports the hypothesis that the targeted
residues are not directly involved in FMN binding and that the mutations
do not affect the overall architecture of the enzyme. Secondary impacts
of these mutations resulting in subtle alterations within the active
site are investigated below.

One of the benefits in using PETNR
to study enzymatic hydride transfer
mechanisms is that individual catalytic steps can be accessed by stopped-flow
measurements that track changes in FMN absorbance during the reductive
half-reaction of the enzyme catalytic cycle. The loss of FMN absorbance
during reduction of PETNR by NAD(P)H reports directly on the hydride
transfer step, which is essentially irreversible. The observed limiting
rate constant (kred) at saturating coenzyme
concentration is therefore the rate of hydride transfer from which
the intrinsic KIE values can also be obtained when using deuterated
coenzyme. Note that previously we have not observed evidence for other
processes affecting the kinetics of H-transfer in OYEs, e.g., isomerization
of the enzyme–substrate complex, and we propose that the measured
KIE is therefore an intrinsic value, but we accept that the absence
of evidence cannot be taken as proof.53 To further support this proposition, we have measured the effect
of pH on the rate of FMN reduction with NADPH and (R)-[4-2H]-NADPH. Neither reaction is significantly pH-dependent
(Figure S4 and Table S3), suggesting kinetic
complexity is minimal and observed rate constants report directly
on hydride transfer kinetics.

For the PETNR variant enzymes,
the coenzyme concentration dependencies
of hydride transfer rates were recorded (Figure S5). H-transfer was monitored by following the quenching of
PETNR-bound FMN absorbance at 465 nm when mixing the enzyme with NAD(P)H
(for representative kinetic traces, see Figure 2), as described previously.50,51 Limiting rate constants (kred) and apparent
saturation constants (KS) at 25 °C
for PETNR-catalyzed hydride transfer are shown in Table 1. Although a plethora of data
is available for WT PETNR from previous investigations, we re-examined
all the kinetics of the WT enzyme for the purpose of this study to
eliminate any possible disparities arising from slightly different
conditions, coenzyme purity, or experimental setup. We were able to
confirm that there is no difference between the kred and KS values obtained
in this study and those previously published for WT PETNR.48

values were normalized for a better comparison. Conditions: 50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 20 μM enzyme, 10 mM NADPH
or 25 mM NADH (final concentrations).

The kinetic traces measured at 25 °C were adequately
fit using
a single exponential function for WT PETNR and for some variants.
However, the behavior of a number of variants was found to be more
complex (vide infra for a more detailed analysis), with the majority
of the reaction transients fitting to a double-exponential function,
comprising a fast rate (kobs1) and a slow
rate (kobs2 < 5 s–1). The values presented in Table 1 reflect only the fast rate of the reaction, as extracted
from the fits of the concentration dependence studies (Figure S5). By determining the saturation constant
(KS) for each variant, we noticed that
there is no major difference in the apparent affinity for NADPH, with
the I107L variant having the same affinity (107 ± 5 μM)
as WT PETNR (103 ± 4 μM), while the other variants have
slightly higher values for KS, with the
most prominent change for L25A PETNR, which exhibits a 2-fold increase
(KS = 199 ± 6 μM).

Analyzing
the limiting rate of reduction, we observed correlations
between the size of the side chain and the H-transfer rates: while
the conservative (L25I and I107L) mutations have only a minor effect
on the rate of FMN reduction, the alanine substitutions impose a markedly
modified reaction rate. The rate of H-transfer is 60% faster for the
L25A variant than for WT PETNR, while a 40% reduction in rate is observed
for the I107A variant (Table 1). This suggests that an increase in the mobility of the FMN
binding site, caused by shortening the L25 side chain, is enhancing
catalytic rates, while a larger void above the NADPH substrate, induced
by truncation of I107 side chain, is decreasing catalytic rates. While
the L25A and L25I variants exhibit a very similar change in rate for
the reaction with NADH (when compared to NADPH), the mutations introduced
at the I107 site do not affect the limiting rate constant and, moreover,
afford better binding of NADH. When comparing kred/KS (which reports, in this
case, on the efficiency of each variant to perform the reductive half-reaction),
we conclude that the increase in rate for L25A variants comes with
a cost of lower binding affinity, leading to a slightly less efficient
enzyme. We have noticed similar compensatory behavior in the reaction
of other OYEs with nicotinamide coenzyme biomimetics, where elevated
catalytic rates are associated with inverse changes in binding affinity.54 The I107A variant is more efficient in the reaction
with NADH and is noticeably less efficient for performing H-transfer
from NADPH. Further, we performed temperature dependence studies of
the rate of FMN reduction with both NADPH and NADH coenzymes, along
with their corresponding deuterated forms, in the range of 5–40
°C. The unusual behavior of the variants is first noticed through
the shape of the transients observed, with all variants manifesting
multiple kinetic phases at elevated temperatures (Figure 2). In general, the kinetic
traces could be fitted to a single exponential function for low temperatures
(<20 °C), while at higher temperatures the FMN reduction takes
place with multiple resolvable kinetic phases.

It was observed
that the amplitude of the slow kinetic components
increases with increasing temperature (Figure 3), with the effect being more pronounced
for the L25A and I107A variants in the case of PETNR reduction by
NADPH (∼40% of the total absorbance change attributed to kobs2 at 40 °C). The reduction with deuterated
substrates follows closely that observed for NADPH (Figure S6 and Tables S4–S13). This suggests that the
reaction chemistry (H vs D transfer) is not kinetically controlled,
and the differences observed are solely attributed to perturbations
in the enzyme–coenzyme complex arising from mutagenesis of
PETNR. FMN reduction follows the same trend with NADH for L25A and
L25I variants, with multiple reactive configurations (MRCs) at elevated
temperature and similar changes of amplitude contributions for each
kinetic component. However, the mutagenesis of the I107 site does
not induce the formation of MRCs in reactions with NADH (the kinetic
traces fit to a single exponential function across the studied temperature
range, Figure 3 and Figure S7), a contrasting behavior when compared
to reduction by NADPH. This indicates that truncation of the I107
site has no detrimental effect on H-transfer from NADH coenzyme, while
the NADPH reaction is noticeably affected. This suggests truncation
of the I107 side chain induces propagated effects (which extend beyond
the tilting of the Q241 side chain observed from X-ray data) on the
structure (and dynamics) of the enzyme.

Figure 3 Manifestation of multiple
reactive configurations as a function
of temperature for investigated PETNR variants. For variants manifesting
MRCs, the relative amplitude of the slow kinetic phase (kobs2) during FMN reduction of PETNR variants by NADPH
and NADH increases with temperature. The relative amplitude is reporting
on the change in amplitude corresponding to the slow kinetic phase
out of the total change in amplitude measured during FMN reduction.
For L25A variant, the amplitude value at 40 °C represents the
sum of two slow kinetic phases (kobs2 and kob3, see Tables S5 and S10).

We have previously detected MRCs
in the N189A variant of morphinone
reductase (MR), another enzyme belonging to the OYE family, in which
four detectable MRCs could be kinetically resolved.36 Likewise, the data for the reduction of PETNR variants
suggests that NADPH and NADH are able to bind in multiple conformations
in the active site of PETNR variants, which leads to different competent
states of the enzyme–coenzyme complex that are able to perform
H-transfer, observed as multiple kinetic phases bearing KIEs (Figures S8 and S9). While the kred value is highest for L25A, this fast reactive conformation
is very slowly interconverting (<1 s–1) with
another slow reactive conformation. In our previous work involving
MR,36 we were able to corroborate that
the resolved kinetic phases represent different configurations of
the enzyme–coenzyme complex using computational methods. Herein,
we propose that our observations with PETNR are consistent with those
we have reported previously with MR. However, we cannot exclude other
explanations at this stage, e.g., a mechanism involving multiple free
enzyme species that have different reactivities. For example, an isotopically
insensitive isomerization from an inactive configuration into an active
configuration would be expected to diminish the observed KIE. Regardless
of the origin of multiple kinetic phases observed in the variants
presented here, these data demonstrate that second sphere mutations
in the PETNR active site have differing effects on the reaction with
NADH and NADPH.

Given the KIE values at 25 °C are only
slightly affected by
mutagenesis, with small differences between the studied variants (Figure S8), we consider that a better way to
interpret the data (as we have recently described elsewhere51) is by comparing the activation parameters (presented
in Table 2). We analyzed
the thermodynamic parameters of the H-transfer reaction by fitting
the Arrhenius plots of kobs1 (Figure 4) to the nonlinear
Eyring-based function 1  where
ΔHT0⧧ and ΔST0⧧ are the apparent activation
enthalpy and entropy,
respectively, at a reference temperature (T0, 298 K in this study), ΔCp⧧ is the difference in heat capacity between the reactant
and transition states, and kB, h, and R are the Boltzmann, Planck, and
ideal gas constants, respectively.55,56 This model
has recently been used for interpreting curvatures observed in Eyring
plots for a number of enzymes,57,58 and recent computational
work suggests changes in ΔCp⧧ are related to dynamical changes during catalysis
and these changes are attributed from contributions of not only active
site regions but also distal domains of the enzyme (dynamical changes
that are dispersed throughout the entire structure).59

in kobs1 values for I107A PETNR reaction
with NADPH and (R)-[4-2H]-NADPH at 35–40
°C suggests a different mechanism at elevated temperatures; hence,
the data were omitted during the fitting.

For the reactions with NADPH and (R)-[4-2H]-NADPH, the apparent activation enthalpy values for WT PETNR
are
identical with those previously reported, with a coenzyme isotope
effect of 6.4 ± 0.4 kJ mol–1, which we previously
inferred to be an evidence of a “soft” promoting motion
(a promoting vibration with a relatively small force constant) contributing
to catalysis.43 The kinetic isotope effect
on the FMN reduction with NADH and (R)-[4-2H]-NADH in WT PETNR manifests less temperature independence (ΔΔHT0⧧ = 4.9 ± 0.2 kJ mol–1) when compared with the KIE on the NADPH reaction
(note that early work indicated a measurable temperature-independent
KIE, which we now consider to be underestimated43). Overall, when comparing the apparent activation enthalpies
and entropies for the PETNR variants, we observed a strong compensatory
behavior (Figure S10). This linear enthalpy–entropy
compensation was recently observed in a study involving “heavy”
PETNR isotopologues.51 This compensation
effect is closely observed for ΔΔHT0⧧ and ΔΔST0⧧: changes in ΔΔHT0⧧ values are reflected by similar
changes in ΔΔST0⧧ (Figure 5A). Moreover,
for the NADPH reaction, there is a strong correlation between the
rate of the reaction and the coenzyme KIEs (differences in the apparent
activation enthalpy, (R)-[4-2H]-NADPH–NADPH),
but there is no correlation for the NADH reaction (Figure 5B).

activation enthalpy (ΔΔHT0⧧) and entropy (A) and correlations between ΔΔHT0⧧ and observed rate constant
(B) during H-transfer for the PETNR variants.

The more prominent changes in ΔCp⧧ are observed for the variants with side
chain
truncations (L25A and I107A), which manifest a more negative ΔCp⧧ when compared to WT PETNR.
A recent study of ketosteroid isomerase and α-glucosidase MalL
showed that the decrease in ΔCp⧧ can be explained through significant dynamical contributions
of regions remote from the active site.59 In the case of PETNR, the effect of side chain truncation on catalytic
rates, enthalpy values, coupled with the nonequivalence in reactivity
toward the two coenzyme and changes in ΔCp⧧, could inform on vibrational coupling
(previously observed in “heavy enzyme” studies19,50) that is extended beyond the mutagenesis site(s). While it is assumed
that ΔCp⧧ values
are negative for enzyme systems in which the chemical reaction is
rate limiting (as the heat capacity for enzyme–substrate complex
is larger than for the enzyme–transition state complex),59 most of the data for PETNR reduction by NADH
show positive values for ΔCp⧧.

The kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the
reduction of FMN
in the PETNR variants reveals coenzyme-specific perturbations to the
H-transfer chemistry and thermal equilibrium of reactant states. The
current knowledge we have at hand to rationalize these findings comes
mainly from crystallographic studies (presented herein) and previously
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD data suggest
a similar binding mode for both NADPH and NADH coenzymes in the active
site of PETNR,43 which makes it difficult
to rationalize the differences in H-transfer chemistry and thermal
conformation equilibrium presented above. Although the crystal structure
of the PETNR−NADH4 complex (PDB: 3KFT(43)) provides valuable insight into the structural proximity
of reacting groups in the active site, π–π stacking
between the symmetry-related adenosine moieties of NADH4 in the two PETNR−NADH4 monomers present in the
asymmetric unit of the crystal lattice results in the pyrophosphate
and adenosine groups of NADH4 being poorly coordinated
by PETNR. The absence of such interactions limits predictions and
analyses that can be made regarding the conformational preferences
of NADPH4 binding to PETNR. Despite numerous attempts,
we have been unable to crystallize the PETNR−NADPH4 complex, which limits further structural and computational investigations.
Consequently, we pursued NMR studies of WT PETNR and recently reported
the 1H, 15N, and 13C sequential backbone
resonance assignments of the holoenzyme.52 Building on this recent work, we have now performed near-complete
backbone resonance assignments of the ground-state PETNR−NADH4 and PETNR−NADPH4 complexes at saturating
concentrations of either NADH4 or NADPH4, which
we further used to inspect differences in the binding modes between
the coenzymes.

Given the large size of PETNR (40 kDa), TROSY-based
3D heteronuclear
experiments were acquired and analyzed, which enabled a highly successful
degree of assignment (97%) of the 1H–15N TROSY spectrum for each complex. Compared to the extent of assignment
achieved for PETNR (333 residues), in the case of the PETNR−NADH4 complex, 334 residues were successfully assigned, as H184
could be identified as a sharp and intense peak after ligand addition.
Further assignment of one more residue of the flexible loop (D274)
was also achieved; however, residue R164 could not be assigned, most
probably due to peak overlap. The PETNR−NADPH4 complex
was assigned to the greatest extent (335 residues), with all residues
identified as in the PETNR−NADH4 complex, as well
as the additional assignment of residue R164.

In order to assess
the impact of the NAD(P)H4 coenzyme
analogue binding on the PETNR structure, we comparatively analyzed
the 1H–15N TROSY spectrum of PETNR with 1H–15N TROSY spectra of the PETNR−NADH4 and PETNR−NADPH4 complexes. Overall, the
changes in chemical shift for 1HN and 15N are limited to similar residue segments for all complex comparisons
(Figure S11). The differences in combined
chemical shift between each complex and PETNR, and a visual mapping
of these changes onto the crystal structure of the PETNR−NADH4 complex (PDB: 3KFT(43)) is illustrated in Figure 6. It can be observed
that, while the majority of the peaks are essentially not sensitive
to coenzyme analogue binding, localized areas of PETNR are noticeably
affected by the addition of either NADPH4 or NADH4 (see Figure S12 for a structural overview
of notably affected regions). Most of the changes that occur in PETNR
upon binding of the coenzyme analogues are localized approximately
5 Å away from either NADH4 or the FMN cofactor, with
similarly affected sites for both the NADPH4 and NADH4 analogues. The regions that are affected significantly by
binding of NAD(P)H4 are depicted in Figure 6B. These encompass several loop regions (with
maximum chemical shift differences recorded at residues T26, Y68,
T104, Q241, G277, A302, Y351), a histidine “patch” that
is known from crystallographic data to coordinate the NADH4 coenzyme analogue60 (denoted the H184
patch) and an α-helix found in close contact with the FMN cofactor
(denoted the R324 helix). Coenzyme analogue binding is also observed
to cause significant chemical shift changes in the β-hairpin
flap (a region encompassing N126-T147), suggesting a major role of
this structural motif in binding the NAD(P)H coenzyme in the active
site. The significant differences in chemical shift between PETNR
and the PETNR−NAD(P)H4 complexes observed in the
β-sheet containing A58 and the loop involving Y351 (which are
known to coordinate the FMN cofactor60),
along with differences located at the top of the β-barrel that
is in close proximity to FMN, suggest that NAD(P)H4 binding
induces FMN repositioning within the active site for efficient H-transfer.
This is supported by the formation of a charge-transfer complex between
NAD(P)H4 and FMN, resulting in changes to the electrostatic
distribution within the system, which contributes to the observed
differences in chemical shift. For T26, the large difference in chemical
shift can be explained by the formation of a hydrogen bond between
the side chain hydroxyl group of T26 and the NH2 group
of the carboxamide function of the nicotinamide ring in NAD(P)H4 and by perturbations in the hydrogen bond between the backbone
amide proton of T26 and the N5 atom of FMN. For the resonances assigned
in the G277 loop, the NMR data suggest that coenzyme analogue binding
induces a dramatic reorganization of the loop. This effect is propagated
into the α-helix from which the G277 loop emerges, which is
also moderately affected by NAD(P)H4 binding, even though
it is positioned far away from the active site.

Figure 6 Observed changes in chemical
shift for PETNR upon binding the NADH4 or the NADPH4 coenzyme analogues. (A) Histograms
of the residue-specific chemical shift changes for the backbone amide
groups in PETNR upon binding NADH4 (red) or NADPH4 (blue). The absolute chemical shift changes were calculated using
the following equation: ΔδX = [(δHNPETNR – δHNX)2 + (C(δNPETNR – δNX))2]1/2, where δHN is the backbone
amide proton chemical shift, δN is the backbone amide
nitrogen chemical shift, C value is 0.12 (for rescaling
of δN values), and X is either the
PETNR−NADH4 complex or the PETNR−NADPH4 complex. The lower histogram shows the residue-specific chemical
shift differences between the PETNR−NADH4 complex
and the PETNR−NADPH4 complex, with red and blue
bars indicating larger changes in PETNR upon binding NADH4 or NADPH4, respectively. The absolute chemical shift
differences between the PETNR−NAD(P)H4 complexes
were calculated as Δδ = [(ΔδPETNR−NADPH4 – ΔδPETNR−NADH4)2]1/2. The secondary structure of PETNR
is shown at the top of the figure with gray helices denoting α-helices
and white arrows indicating β-strands. Regions with significant
Δδ values are highlighted with segment labels. (B) Distributions
of Δδ values plotted onto the structure of the PETNR−NADH4 complex (PDB: 3KFT). Residues with significant Δδ values
are colored red (ΔδPETNR−NADH4, left panel) and blue (ΔδPETNR−NADPH4, right panel). The FMN cofactor is shown as yellow
sticks, the NADH4 coenzyme analogue is shown as green sticks,
and the mutation sites (L25 and I107) are depicted as purple sticks.
The central panel encompasses a zoomed-in view of the active site
and highlights the Δδ values between the two complexes
(red, larger Δδ upon PETNR−NADH4 complex
formation; blue, larger Δδ upon PETNR−NAPDH4 complex formation) and is a structural visualization of the
data in the lower histogram. Side chains are shown as gold wireframes
and regions with significant ΔΔδ values are highlighted
with segment labels. Proline residues, unassigned residues, and residues
with Δδ < 0.04 ppm (the standard deviation) are left
blank in the representation, while residues with Δδ ≥
0.04 ppm are colored as described above, with a stronger intensity
of color representing a higher Δδ value. In the central
panel, no cutoff was applied for Δδ.

Overall, similar residue segments show differences in backbone
amide 15N chemical shifts between the PETNR−NADH4 and PETNR−NADPH4 complexes (Figure 7). Analysis of amide 15N chemical shift changes (ΔδN) can provide
valuable information on the location of conformational differences
between the complexes, as they report mainly on changes in backbone
torsion angles. The only structural difference between the coenzyme
analogues is the presence of a 2′-phosphate group on the ribose
ring of the adenosine moiety in NADPH4. Therefore, ΔδN values reported between these analogues reflect how PETNR
specifically modifies its conformational and dynamic preferences to
accommodate NADPH4 binding in the active site.

mapping of absolute chemical shift differences for backbone
amide 15N atoms calculated as ΔδN = [(δNPETNR−NADPH4 – δNPETNR−NADH4)2]1/2 plotted
onto the structure of the PETNR−NADH4 complex (PDB: 3KFT) (Figure S11). Residues with significant ΔδN values are colored red, with a stronger intensity of color
representing a higher ΔδN value, with a cutoff
of 0.1 ppm applied. The side chains are shown as wireframes in the
putty representation of the protein, the FMN cofactor is shown as
yellow sticks, the NADH4 coenzyme analogue is shown as
green sticks, and the mutation sites (L25 and I107) are depicted as
purple sticks. The zoomed-in view of the β-hairpin flap highlights
the ΔδN values between the two complexes and
identifies the location of R130 and Q241, which are residues with
significant differences between the two complexes.

The residue with the largest ΔδN value involves
T131, present in a cluster of contiguous residues (T129–R134
and A140–T147 of the β-hairpin flap), which have significant 15N chemical shift differences (Figure 7 and Figure S11). Although the R130 side chain and the putative location of the
2′-phosphate group are not within the hydrogen-bonding distance
in the crystal structure of the PETNR−NADH4 complex,
it is likely that bond rotation would allow productive coordination
of these groups in solution. Structural perturbations within the β-hairpin
flap are propagated to Y68 and also to Q241 via a network of side
chain hydrogen bonds involving Y186, which are positioned directly
over the face of the nicotinamide ring of NADH4 in close
proximity to I107. Conformational differences within the β-hairpin
flap are also propagated through side chain hydrogen bonding with
R134 to the L25–I31 and E348–G352 regions. For the D274–G277
loop with missing structural density in the crystal, chemical shift
differences in the G278–E283 region indicate that the loop
likely coordinates the coenzyme. Remarkably, chemical shift perturbations
are also noted for G301–A302 and F322–G323, which are
residues that coordinate the phosphate group present in FMN, indicating
that conformational and dynamic preferences for NADH4 and
NADPH4 coordination by PETNR are propagated through the
charge-transfer complex formed with FMN.

Based on the differences
in chemical shift observed between PETNR
and the PETNR−NAD(P)H4 complexes, we can now rationalize,
in part, the kinetic behavior of the investigated variants. Residue
L25 presents large differences in chemical shift for both PETNR−NADH4 and PETNR−NADPH4 complexes, and these observations
are most readily explained by its close proximity to T26, which is
a residue directly involved in FMN cofactor binding.60 In the crystal structure, residue I107 is positioned ∼8
Å away from the face of the NADH4 nicotinamide ring
and is sandwiched between Y68, Y186, and Q241, which make direct contact
with the coenzyme analogue and a segment of the β-hairpin flap.
I107 is slightly affected by NADPH4 binding, but not by
NADH4 binding, suggesting that the presence of phosphate
in the coenzyme analogue contributes to a more pronounced reorientation
of the loop containing I107. Overall, the structural features in the
vicinity of the FMN cofactor (and residue L25) are highly affected
by both coenzymes, with higher chemical shift changes occurring upon
NADH4 addition, while the regions affected more by NADPH4 binding are situated in the vicinity of residue I107 (Figure 6B). The fact that
residue I107 is not affected by NADH4 binding, and H-transfer
kinetics are also not majorly affected for the reduction with NADH
(i.e., FMN reduction occurs in a single phase), as in contrast with
NADPH4, informs clearly about differences in the binding
modes of the two coenzymes, which have consequences on the H-transfer
mechanism. Along with the observed reorientation of Q241 side chain
in I107A variant, the NMR and thermodynamic data suggests extended
vibrational coupling is present during H-transfer from NADPH to PETNR.

To further the analysis of the binding modes of the two coenzymes,
we performed an analysis of the 1H line width of peaks
in the 1H–15N TROSY spectra (Figure S13), which enables detection of residues
that have a significant exchange contribution to the transverse relaxation
rate (R2). Broadening of the line width
suggests conformational exchange between two or more species on the
microsecond to millisecond NMR time scale.61 It can be observed that PETNR exhibits a high degree of conformational
exchange on this time scale, with most of the regions affected being
located around the active site (Figure S14). A reduction in the exchange contribution to R2 can be observed for some residues following addition
of NADH4, such as those situated in the G277 loop. The
minimization of this dynamic behavior is even more pronounced in the
case of the PETNR−NADPH4 complex, for which most
of these slow conformational exchange processes are removed. The data
indicate that the NADPH4 coenzyme mimic is interacting
more tightly with PETNR than its nonphosphorylated counterpart, which
explains the higher affinity of PETNR for NADPH than for NADH (Table 1). The mutations chosen
for kinetic studies are located on the edge of these regions that
exhibit microsecond to millisecond conformational exchange in PETNR.
Residue I107 is not a dynamic center, but it is located in a region
with moderate dynamic behavior in PETNR, while line widths for residues
in the vicinity of L25 are considerably broadened. Both regions around
the targeted residues show a restriction in conformational exchange
on addition of coenzyme, suggesting an important role of binding in
controlling enzyme motions on the microsecond to millisecond time
scale.

This study was undertaken to investigate how second sphere
“noncatalytic”
residues influence vibrational modes linked to H-transfer and H-tunneling
in PETNR. The use of a combination of experimental tools (e.g., stopped-flow
rapid kinetics, isotope/temperature dependence studies of H-transfer
and NMR spectroscopy) allowed us to underpin a complex, coenzyme-specific
kinetic and thermodynamic equilibrium during H-transfer in the investigated
variants. The side chain modifications (L25I, L25A, I107A, and I107L
PETNR) were designed on the basis of their location within the active
site (situated along the FMN-NAD(P)H N5–C4 axis in the PETNR−NAD(P)H
complexes). The hypothesis that the targeted side chains are not involved
in major electrostatic interactions within the active site was confirmed
through stationary UV–vis spectroscopy and crystallographic
data. The side chain modifications are subtle, but they prompt changes
to the conformational landscape of the enzyme that can be observed
during the reductive half-reaction using stopped-flow techniques.
The rate of H-transfer at room temperature is broadly maintained through
enthalpy–entropy compensation. However, temperature dependence
studies of H-transfer revealed a coenzyme-specific and complex thermodynamic
equilibrium between different reactive configurations in PETNR–coenzyme
complexes. We find that mutagenesis of these second sphere “noncatalytic”
residues (L25 and I107) has differing effects on the reactivity (activation
entropy and enthalpy) of PETNR with NADPH and NADH coenzymes. We attribute
these differences in coenzyme reactivity to subtle, dynamic structural
changes in the PETNR active site. This interpretation is aided by
NMR chemical shift data measured for PETNR−NADH4 and PETNR−NADPH4, which show structural differences
between the two complexes.

Concluding Remarks
Enzymes have
evolved to catalyze chemical reactions with extraordinary
selectivity and specificity, and it is often assumed that predominantly
one configuration of the enzyme–substrate complex will be the
catalytically active one. This hypothesis has a strong physical basis
for the reaction of WT enzymes with their natural substrates. However,
when dealing with enzyme variants, the perturbation of the finely
tuned enzyme structure by mutagenesis can change the conformational
flexibility and geometries in the enzyme to the extent that multiple
reactive conformations are populated. To date, kinetic studies of
OYEs have allowed us to demonstrate that variants of two enzymes in
this family (N189A variant of MR36 and
this study) exhibit shifted distributions of reactive conformational
states when compared to the corresponding WT enzymes. While the N189A
variant of MR could be considered a disruptive mutation (N189 is intimately
involved in coenzyme binding through H-bonding), it is not the case
for the variants in the current study. Herein, the synergistic use
of complementary spectroscopic techniques has allowed us to unravel
the nonequivalence of second sphere “noncatalytic” residues
in PETNR. The complex kinetic behavior observed upon truncation of
L25 and I107 side chains indicates long-range cooperativity throughout
the active site. We suggest that formation of MRCs could be a common
feature when investigating variant enzymes, and other authors have
pointed toward the existence of parallel reaction pathways during
catalysis.62−65 Moreover, kinetic complexities on H-transfer caused by (distal)
mutagenesis have been observed in dihydrofolate reductase catalysis,31 and these effects have been correlated with
protein dynamics contributions.26,33,66−68 While we are aware of the experimental challenges
that would allow us to visualize MRCs in a wider range of H-transfer
enzymes, we propose that synergistic experimental approaches should
aid interpretation of kinetic data. This study is an illustration
of how the use of integrated structural and kinetic experimental tools
can uncover details often masked in more traditional studies of H-transfer
(e.g., those reliant only on the use of steady-state turnover studies
with isotopically labeled substrates). These approaches are needed
to identify these hidden complexities even for relatively simple reactions
such as H-transfer. Similar approaches are therefore likely to be
informative with other enzymes to understand the relative importance
of small-scale dynamics in controlling enzymatic rates of reaction.
