The 14N/15N
isotopic exchange pathways over
Co3Mo3N, a material of interest as an ammonia
synthesis catalyst and for the development of nitrogen transfer reactions,
have been investigated. Both the homomolecular and heterolytic exchange
processes have been studied, and it has been shown that lattice nitrogen
species are exchangeable. The exchange behavior was found to be a
strong function of pretreatment with ca. 25% of lattice N atoms being
exchanged after 40 min at 600 °C after N2 pretreatment
at 700 °C compared to only 6% following similar Ar pretreatment.
This observation, for which the potential contribution of adsorbed
N species can be discounted, is significant in terms of the application
of this material. In the case of the Co6Mo6N
phase, regeneration to Co3Mo3N under 15N2 at 600 °C occurs concurrently with 14N15N formation. These observations demonstrate the reactivity
of nitrogen in the Co–Mo–N system to be a strong function
of pretreatment and worthy of further consideration.

1 Introduction
Metal
nitrides continue to attract attention as alternative catalysts.1−5 Among them, Co3Mo3N has been demonstrated
to possess high activity for ammonia synthesis, particularly when
promoted with low levels of Cs+.6−10 Studies of Co3Mo3N have also
been undertaken with the aim of determining the possibility of developing
novel nitrogen transfer pathways, wherein the “lattice”
N can be used as an activated form of nitrogen with the potential
to undergo reaction with suitable target molecules.11−14 This could lead to interesting
developments in the identification of new transformation pathways.
As part of these studies, the formation of Co6Mo6N, a previously unreported nitride with the η-12 carbide structure,12 has been documented to occur when undertaking
reduction with a 3:1 H2:Ar feed at elevated temperature.11−14 The transformation is shown to occur between Co3Mo3N and Co6Mo6N line phases with no intermediate
stoichiometries apparently being evident. The presence of hydrogen
has been demonstrated to be essential in order for the transformation
to occur, despite the observation that the nitrogen which is eliminated
from the structure predominantly, but not exclusively, forms N2. The regeneration of Co3Mo3N from the
reduced Co6Mo6N phase has been observed to be
rapid when applying a 3:1 H2:N2 feed and is
also possible with pure N2, albeit requiring higher temperatures
and longer regeneration times.15 In the
present communication, we extend the previous studies of this system
by applying a series of temperature programmed nitrogen isotopic exchange
(TPNIE) and isothermal nitrogen isotopic exchange (INIE) experiments.
The isotopic exchange technique is well established for reactions
of oxygen isotopes with metal oxide and metal oxide supported systems.16,17 In such studies, two general reaction types have been investigated:(i) homomolecular exchange
in which a
mixture of labeled oxygen molecules, typically 18O2 and 16O2, is scrambled over a surface,
and

(ii) heterolytic exchange
in which a labeled
molecule, typically 18O2, is scrambled with
the “lattice” oxygen species of the catalyst (generally 16O species as dictated by the relative abundance of the various
oxygen isotopes).



Historically, examples
of nitrogen isotopic exchange can be found
in the literature, where examples of gas-phase equilibration of 14N2/15N2 mixtures have been
reported on catalytic systems of interest for ammonia synthesis, most
notably those based upon Fe,18 Ru,19,20 and Os.21 The results of such studies
send a cautionary note in terms of their direct applicability as probes
of ammonia synthesis activity in which N2 activation is
generally rate limiting. With the latter point in mind, it may be
anticipated that the relative N2 exchange rate could be
directly related to NH3 synthesis activity. However, in
some systems the simultaneous presence of H2 in the gas
phase is observed to enhance the isotopic scrambling rate, whereas
in others it is observed to suppress it. Examples of each type of
behavior can be found in closely related systems. For example, in
the case of Ru, hydrogen enhances equilibration rate whereas in the
case of potassium promoted systems it retards it.19 Despite the limitations of N2 exchange as a
method to evaluate ammonia synthesis reaction activity, it is nevertheless
a suitable and direct probe reaction with which to monitor the reactivity
of “lattice” nitrogen species. Accordingly, we have
undertaken studies involving both homomolecular and heterolytic nitrogen
exchange pathways, with the aim of characterizing the reactivity of
nitrogen (both gas-phase and “lattice”) in terms of
the cobalt molybdenum nitride system. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that such studies have been reported for Co3Mo3N.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
The procedure applied for
the preparation of Co3Mo3N has been documented
in detail elsewhere.11,13,14 In summary, a hydrated cobalt molybdate precursor was prepared and
subjected to ammonolysis applying a carefully controlled temperature
ramp rate. The sample was then cooled to ambient temperature under
ammonia prior to being subjected to a passivation procedure enacted
to facilitate removal from the preparation apparatus. The resultant
sample was subsequently reactivated in a flow of 3:1 H2:N2 for 2 h at 700 °C to yield the crystalline Co3Mo3N phase. The purity of the phase was evaluated
by powder X-ray diffracton (XRD) with a PANalytical Empyrean instrument,
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) as the X-ray source.
Data were collected in the range 5° ≤ 2θ ≤
85° (step time = 1 s; step size = 0.017° 2θ). The
surface area was determined by applying the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method to the nitrogen physisorption isotherm obtained at −196
°C, in a Micromeritics equipment TRISTAR 3000 analyser. The nitride
sample (0.3 g) was first heated up to 250 °C for 2 h under vacuum
and degassed at 250 °C for 2 h prior to analysis.

2.2 Nitrogen Isotopic Exchange
Nitrogen
isotopic exchange experiments were performed in a setup already described
in oxygen isotopic exchange studies.16,22 A U-form reactor
was placed in a closed recycle system which was connected on one side
to a mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, QMS 200) for the monitoring
of the gas phase composition and on the other side by a vacuum pump.
The recycling pump placed in the system removes limitations due to
gas-phase diffusion. TPNIE and INIE experiments were undertaken on
200 mg of Co3Mo3N. The Co3Mo3N sample was additionally subjected to a 3:1 H2:N2 activation step at 700 °C for 1 h prior to cooling
to either 400 °C for TPNIE or to various desired temperatures
(see Results and Discussion) for INIE, at
which point the system was purged (using vacuum and/or argon flow)
and the isotopic mixture charged. Other protocols have also been used
and will be described later in the text. The study of homolytic exchange
(also called equilibration reaction) was performed using a mixture
of 14N2 and 15N2 (98%+
purity, supplied by Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) whereas,
for the study of the heterolytic exchange, the equimolar mixture was
replaced by 15N2 alone. A ramp rate of the temperature
was 2 °C/min was used for TPNIE experiments. The masses 28, 29,
and 30 m/z were monitored as a function
of time to follow the exchange. The m/z values of 2, 17, and 18 were also recorded to determine if H atoms
remained at the surface of the nitride, thus yielding NH3 or H2 in the gas phase after decomposition. The presence
of NOx and O2 was also checked
by monitoring the corresponding m/z values. The method by which the atomic fraction of 15N in the gas phase (αg) and the number of atoms
exchanged (Ne) can be calculated is described
in previous references.16,17 Typically: 1  where P30, P29, and P28 are
the partial pressures of 15N2, 14N15N, and 14N2 respectively; 2  for
heterolytic exchange where Ng is the number
of 15N atoms in the gas phase
at the beginning of the reaction.

Finally the number of exchangeable
atoms can be calculated when equilibrium between the gas phase and
the solid is reached by using: 3  where α* is the value of αg at equilibrium.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Homomolecular versus Heterolytic Exchange
over the Co3Mo3N Phase
Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern of the sample after treatment
under a 3:1 H2:N2 flow at 700 °C for 2
h. In agreement with previous studies in which such a treatment was
applied,14 the diffractogram matches to
a pure Co3Mo3N phase (hereafter abbreviated
as the 331 phase).

Figure 1 XRD pattern of Co3Mo3N material.

This material, which has a very
low BET surface area (less than
5 m2/g) was subjected to nitrogen isotopic exchange. Taken
together with the powder X-ray diffraction pattern in Figure 1 in which there is no evidence of any great degree
of disorder, it is reasonable to suppose that the majority of nitrogen
species are located within the bulk. In the first set of experiments,
we studied the capacity of the 331 phase to activate the dinitrogen
molecule via homomolecular exchange by using the TPNIE and INIE techniques.
The results of the TPNIE experiment are shown in Figure 2a, in which it can be seen that there is a decrease in the
partial pressure of 15N2 as a function of increasing
temperature during which the partial pressures of both 14N15N and 14N2 increase. Closer inspection
of the profile (Figure 2b) demonstrates the
formation of 14N15N starts to become evident
at ca. 450 °C.

during
a homomolecular TPNIE experiment on Co3Mo3N
material; (b) inset of the curve of 14N15N partial
pressure between 400 and 500 °C.

In order to ascertain whether, at this temperature, 14N15N formation occurs by homomolecular exchange
(14N2(g) + 15N2(g) ↔
2 14N15N(g)) or heterolytic exchange
(15N2(g) + 14N(s) → 14N15N(g) + 15N(s)), INIE of the 14N2/15N2 mixture was undertaken at 450 °C and the gas-phase 15N concentration was quantified as a function of reaction time. The
results are presented in Figure 3, where it
can be seen that there is a progressive diminution of the partial
pressure of 15N2 during which the partial pressure
of 14N15N increases while the partial pressure
of 14N2 is constant. Finally the progressive
reduction of the 15N gas-phase atomic fraction as the reaction
proceeds is indicative of the heterolytic pathway in which 14N is supplied by the 331 phase. Pure equilibration is not detected
for the 331 phase, suggesting that the material is not able to adsorb
the dinitrogen molecule dissociatively.

Figure 3 Evolution of the nitrogen
isotopomer partial pressures and of the
gas-phase 15N atomic fraction during a homolecular INIE
experiment at 450 °C on Co3Mo3N material.

The capacity of the 331 phase
for exchange was then studied by
performing TPNIE analysis between 450 and 700 °C introducing
only 15N2 (66.7 mbar) into the reactor cell
at the beginning of the experiment. Figures 4a and 4b illustrate the evolution of the gas-phase 15N atomic fraction (abbreviated hereafter as αg) and the progressive accumulation of exchanged N atoms (abbreviated
hereafter as Ne) as a function of time,
which corresponds to an increase of temperature. At the end of the
experiment, after 30 min at 700 °C, the values of αg and Ne remain almost the same,
which indicates that a gas/solid equilibrium is reached. At this stage,
the value of Ne normalized per gram of
solid (49.5 × 1019 N atoms) corresponds to 40% of
the lattice nitrogen atoms in the 331 phase. The value αg achieved at the equilibrium (αg = 0.50)
permits the calculation of the number of exchangeable atoms in the
solid as explained in ref (16). It indicates that 80% of the nitrogen atoms in the 331
phase lattice are exchangeable. It is worth noting that all of these
values are subject to some uncertainties since we observed a small
increase of pressure as a function of increasing temperature, which
was partly due to the presence of H2. One potential source
of H2 is from NHx surface species
known to be present in nitrides prepared by ammonolysis and/or pretreated
with N2/H2.14,23,24

Figure 4 Evolution of (a) the gas-phase 15N atomic concentration
and (b) the number of N atoms exchanged during the heterolytic TPNIE
experiment on Co3Mo3N material.

When a similar TPNIE experiment as above was performed
in which
Ar was substituted for 15N2, we noticed a steady
increase of the m/z = 2 and 28 intensities
(typically amounting to 3.5 mbar of H2 and 5 mbar of N2 respectively at 700 °C) as the temperature increased.
In experiments reported elsewhere it has been shown that the production
of NH3 by Ar/H2 treatment of a Co3Mo3N sample purposefully treated so as to eliminate the
contribution of NHx species is much less
than that of a comparable sample containing NHx.15 Powder neutron diffraction experiments
show no evidence of bulk hydride phases in this system, although there
is the possibility of surface hydride phases. Here we demonstrate
that part of the 331 sample is reduced under a static low pressure
of Ar when heated from 450 to 700 °C with N2 production,
while no NH3 was detected in the gas phase. The activity
of the Co3Mo3N sample in exchange could therefore
be due to the presence of residual NHx species, which are not decomposed when the sample undergoes degassing
at 450 °C.

3.2 Effect of the Nature of
the Gas Purge
In order to assess the importance of NHx species in the present study, a high temperature
(700 °C, 30
min) Ar purge of the sample pretreated with 3:1 H2:N2 flow was undertaken. The sample was then cooled under Ar
at 600 °C and degassed under a secondary vacuum (less than 10–5 mbar). The Co3Mo3N phase should
be stable in the bulk under these conditions11,14 (even if very little reduction was observed to occur during the
previous temperature-programmed experiment under Ar noted above).
However, it could be anticipated that desorption or decomposition
of residual NHx occurs at the surface
of the nitride. INIE of 15N2 was undertaken
at 600 °C (Figure 5) demonstrating that
the heterolytic exchange process occurs to a limited extent. This
suggests that the behavior apparent in Figures 2 and 4 predominantly arises from exchange
with or via surface NHx groups. We simultaneously
observed a slight decrease of the total pressure in the system, confirming
that a low level of reduction occurs due to the Ar purge and secondary
vacuum degassing treatment. In order to generate NHx species, which would have been removed under Ar at 700 °C,
we introduced a low partial pressure of H2 (2.3 mbar) during
the exchange process at 600 °C. The presence of H2 did not induce any change in the evolution of the isotopomer nitrogen
curves, meaning that surface NHx species,
if produced under these conditions, do not play the role of an intermediate
in the exchange mechanism (Figure S1 in the Supporting
Information).

Figure 5 Evolution of the gas-phase N2 isotopic distribution
and of the total pressure during a heterolytic INIE experiment at
600 °C on Co3Mo3N material pretreated with
3:1 H2:N2 followed by an Ar purge for 30 min.

When an Ar purge is replaced by
an He purge treatment, the result
is worse since no exchange is observed. On the contrary, the behavior
of the material totally changes when an Ar purge at 700 °C is
replaced by a 14N2 purge step. The results of
the subsequent 15N2 INIE experiment are presented
in Figure 6a, in which it can be seen that
there is a drastic diminution of the partial pressure of 15N2. Simultaneously the partial pressures of 14N15N and to lesser extent of 14N2 increase. To ascertain that surface NHx species have been effectively removed after the N2 purge,
we successively purged the material at 700 °C with Ar and N2 respectively for periods of 30 min each. The INIE curves
taken at 600 °C after the introduction of 15N2 (Figure 6b) demonstrate that the heterolytic
exchange, which is still very important, does not arise from the exchange
of NHx but results from the reactivity
of lattice nitrogen. It also implies that the nature of the gas utilized
for the purge considerably influences the reactivity of the lattice
nitrogen. It is worth noting that, to be active in exchange reactions,
the material has to be treated under N2 at 700 °C
since the same purge at 600 °C of a sample previously purged
under He at 700 °C does not improve the reactivity of the nitrogen
atoms toward exchange. Another experiment (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information) demonstrated that the
addition of a low pressure of H2 to the 15N2 stream does not modify the exchange process. Finally a temperature-programmed
desorption experiment (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information) was performed on a Co3Mo3N sample treated with an N2 purge at 700 °C and degassed
at 600 °C prior to being cooled down to 400 °C. A pressure
of 50 mbar of Ar was charged in the system, and the temperature was
increased up to 700 °C. We observed a slight increase of the m/z = 28 intensity above 550 °C (typically
amounting to 1 mbar of N2 at 700 °C).

Figure 6 Evolution of the gas-phase
N2 isotopic distribution
and of the total pressure during a heterolytic INIE experiment at
600 °C on Co3Mo3N material pretreated with
3:1 H2:N2 followed by (a) N2 purge
for 30 min or (b) Ar purge and susbsequent N2 purge for
30 min.

A quantification of the amount
of nitrogen atoms exchanged depending
on the pretreatment procedure of the material is presented in Table 1. After 40 min of reaction, the atomic fraction,
αg, of gas-phase 15N was 90.5% when the
331 phase was purged under an Ar flow and 53.8% when N2 was used as the purge gas. The combination of the αg value with the comparison between the initial pressure of 15N2 introduced and the total pressure measured at 40 min
allows the calculation of the number of 15N atoms that
are no longer present in the gas phase. This number amounts to 1.45
× 1020 atoms, corresponding to 11% of the number of
N atoms present in the 331 phase when Ar is the purge gas versus 4.58
× 1020 atoms corresponding to 33% of the number of
N atoms present in the 331 phase when Ar is replaced by N2 as the purge gas. The decrease between the initial pressure and
the pressure at 40 min could be tentatively explained by a regeneration
of the 331 phase that was partially reduced during the pretreatment,
meaning that a proportion of the observed 15N2 consumption is not due to an exchange process but is the result
of a regeneration step. This proportion is dependent to a limited
extent on the nature of the purge gas and represents ca. 5% and 8%
of the total number of N atoms contained in the 331 phase for Ar and
N2 purge gases respectively. We are able to calculate that
after the Ar purge only 6% of the N atoms of the 331 phase are exchanged
versus 28% when N2 is employed. The values calculated from
the curves recorded during the exchange after successive Ar/N2 purges are close to the ones obtained after the N2 purge. The differences are explained by the slightly slower exchange
kinetics observed in the case of the Ar/N2 purge. After
40 min, 25% of the total number of nitrogen atoms in the 331 phase
are exchanged. According to Jacobsen et al.,10 the surface adsorbed nitrogen is completely desorbed under an He
flow below 350 °C. Moreover, in their work the amount of adsorbed
N2 evaluated by TPD measurement is ca. 1.3 μmol/m2 of Cs-promoted Co3Mo3N. Even if this
amount was stable in our conditions (under a secondary vacuum at 873
K), it will be negligible compared with the amount of N atoms exchanged
(less than 5 × 1018 atoms/g). We also exclude this
possibility since a purge under N2 at 600 °C does
not improve the INIE activity of the material. Hence the strong exchange
detected after the N2 purge cannot be explained by the
exchange of residual N adsorbed species.

In conclusion, the
nitrogen atoms of Co3Mo3N can demonstrate a
very high activity to exchange with gas phase
dinitrogen at 600 °C. The extent of this activity is highly dependent
on the pretreatment. This behavior could be attributed to the participation
of the lattice nitrogen atoms in a catalytic cycle via a Mars–van
Krevelen mechanism. At the beginning of the INIE experiments, a small
decrease of the pressure in the system is observed, meaning that a
small degree of reduction of the 331 phase would occur during the
pretreatment (even under a nitrogen purge). It is therefore relevant
to study the behavior of the reduced Co6Mo6N
phase in exchange.

3.3 Behavior of the Co6Mo6N Phase
It is of interest to draw comparisons between the
behavior of Co3Mo3N (331 phase) with that of
Co6Mo6N. Accordingly, a sample of Co6Mo6N (hereafter denoted as the 661 phase) was prepared
by reduction of the 331 phase with 3:1 H2:Ar at 700 °C.
The 331 phase is known to reduce to the 661 phase under these conditions.14 Following reduction, the system was purged with
Ar at 700 °C to remove residual NHx groups and then, following evacuation under secondary vacuum, 50
mbar of 15N2 was admitted. It can be anticipated
that such a pretreatment should preserve the 661 phase at the beginning
of the INIE experiment. The results of the subsequent INIE experiment
are shown in Figure 7, in which it can be seen
that there is a rapid loss of 15N2 which is
offset by the production of 14N2 and 14N15N. In parallel, a strong loss of the pressure in the
system is observed to occur as the reaction proceeds. This strong
loss, explained by the regeneration of the 331 phase from the reduced
661 phase as already reported in a previous study,15 is quantified and reported in Table 1 (right column); 33.3 mbar of N2 was consumed by the material
after 20 min. This corresponds to 40% of the number of N atoms that
compose the 331 phase, meaning that almost all of the sample was in
the reduced form. The 15N atomic fraction obtained at 40
min allows us to calculate that only 6% of the 14N atoms
from the solid are exchanged (on the basis of the stoichiometry of
the 331 phase). Such a value obtained at 700 °C shows that the
process of exchange is very limited compared to the reactivity of
the 331 phase pretreated under nitrogen. Inspecting the curves, we
noticed two phenomena, which were not detected when the solid was
preactivated under H2/N2: (i) the end of the
heterolytic exchange reaction (indicated by the plateaus in the curves
of the distribution of the respective nitrogen isotopomers) is concomitant
with the end of the regeneration (indicated by the plateau observed
in the curve of the total pressure); (ii) the production of 14N2 remains almost null during the reaction, meaning that
only simple heterolytic exchange occurs. We suggest that the 661 phase
is able to activate the gas-phase dinitrogen by dissociation of the
molecule into the “vacancies” of the reduced phase.
Then exchange and regeneration simultaneously take place to generate
a Co3Mo3N material, which is homogenously composed
of 14N and 15N atoms. The exchange process is
then stopped, meaning that a gas/solid equilibrium is reached.

Figure 7 Evolution of
the gas-phase N2 isotopic distribution
and of the total pressure during heterolytic INIE experiment at 600
°C on Co3Mo3N material pretreated with
3:1 H2:Ar followed by 30 min Ar purge.

The results reported in Figures 6 and 7 suggest that the N2 purge was able to
create (or to preserve) preferential sites for the dissociative chemisorption
of the 15N2 molecules, which is the limiting
step of the exchange process.

In the ammonia synthesis reaction,
the presence of an H2 reducing agent in large excess in
the reactant flow would be crucial
for the generation of “lacunary” sites or to generate
preferential sites allowing the activation of dinitrogen. Thus, our
study seems to demonstrate the possible existence of the Mars–van
Krevelen mechanism with participation of bulk nitrogen atoms. It brings
new elements with respect to the classical model described for the
ammonia synthesis in industrial catalysts based on Ru and Fe.25 We should take into account that the standard
temperature for NH3 synthesis is around 400 °C and
the effects observed with isotopic exchange are in the range of 600
°C. Nevertheless we observed during the TPNIE experiment that
exchange occurred before 450 °C (Figure 2) and the reactivity temperature could also be influenced by the
unusual conditions of the isotopic exchange (low total pressure).

4 Conclusion
Nitrogen isotopic exchange was
applied for the first time to the
cobalt molybdenum nitride system with the aim of characterizing the
reactivity of nitrogen (both gas-phase and “lattice”).
Pure homomolecular exchange in which a mixture of 15N2 and 14N2 molecules is scrambled over
a surface did not occur, indicating the low ability of the cobalt
molybdenum nitride system for N2 dissociation. The heterolytic
exchange in which the 15N2 is scrambled with
the lattice nitrogen atoms was observed from 450 °C during the
TPNIE experiment when the Co3Mo3N was subjected
to 3:1 H2:N2 pretreatment until 700 °C
followed by a degassing at 400 °C. Such a pretreatment did not
permit us to exclude the participation of the surface adsorbed −N
(or NHx) species in the exchange mechanism.
Further purging (with Ar or 14N2) of the sample
pretreated with 3:1 H2:N2 flow was undertaken
with the aim to obtain a −N or NHx free surface for the exchange. At 700 °C, treatment of the
331 phase with an argon purge strongly inhibited the ability of the
solid to exchange with the gas phase contrary to a nitrogen purge,
although both types of purge resulted in the absence of surface adsorbed
species. The behavior of the 661 phase was also checked by treating
the solid with a 3:1 H2:Ar flow at 700 °C followed
by an Ar purge at the same temperature. It confirmed that the process
of N-loss/replenishment is fully reversible, as described in previous
work using in situ XRD, and that the Co3Mo3N
catalyst can be readily regenerated with N2 alone. The
661 phase was shown to be active in the exchange at 600 °C with
a strong initial rate of exchange (comparable to the one observed
for the 331 phase when the solid was purged with N2 flow)
but to a lower extent in terms of number of exchanged atoms. The different
exchange behavior in all these experiments was tentatively explained
by a difference in the gas-phase dinitrogen activation that would
require the presence of preferential sites such as vacancies in the
nitride. The reactivity of the lattice nitrogen atoms with gas phase
nitrogen was demonstrated, raising the idea of the possible occurrence
of the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism in the ammonia synthesis
reaction over this family of catalysts.
