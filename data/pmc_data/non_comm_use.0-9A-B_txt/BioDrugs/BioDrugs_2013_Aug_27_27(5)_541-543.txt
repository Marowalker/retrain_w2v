A Published-Ahead-of-Print version of this article was made available online on 9 May 2013 at http://link.springer.com/journal/40259/onlineFirst/page/1.

Errors were subsequently identified in that version of the article, and the following corrections should be noted.

Page 3, section 3.2.1, column 1, 1st paragraph, lines 9–13:

The following phrase which reads:

“In the per-protocol population of the smaller study (n = 87), eribulin had an overall response rate of 11.5 %, whereas patients in the larger study had an overall response rate of 9.3 %; in both studies, all responses were considered partial [27, 28].”

should read:

“In the per-protocol population of the smaller study (n = 87), eribulin had an overall response rate of 11.5 %, whereas patients in the larger study who met key inclusion criteria (eligible patients,n = 269) had an overall response rate of 9.3 %; in both studies, all responses were considered partial [27, 28].”

Page 5, section 3.2.2, column 1, 3rd paragraph, lines 4–7:

The following phrase which reads:

“Patients were required to have previously received at most three chemotherapy regimens (at most two for advanced disease) with each regimen including an anthracycline or a taxane.”

should read:

“Patients were required to have previously received anthracycline and taxane therapy, and at most three chemotherapy regimens (at most two for advanced disease).”

Page 5, section 3.2.2, column 1, 4th paragraph, line 1:

The following phrase which reads:

“Like the EMBRACE study, eribulin increased the median overall survival of patients compared with capecitabine (15.9 vs 14.5 months; HR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.77, 1.00; p = 0.056; Table 4), although this difference was not statistically significant.”

should read:

“Eribulin increased the median overall survival of patients compared with capecitabine (15.9 vs 14.5 months; HR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.77, 1.00; p = 0.056; Table 4), although this difference was not statistically significant.”

Page 6, section 3.3, column 1, 4th paragraph, lines 3–9 and column 2, lines 10–14:

The following phrase which reads:

“Adverse events were reported in 94.1 % of patients receiving eribulin and 90.5 % of patients receiving capecitabine; 17.5 and 21.1 % of patients reported serious adverse events [31]. More patients receiving eribulin had neutropenia (54 vs 16 %) and leukopenia (31 vs 10 %); however, the incidence of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia was similar between treatment groups [31]. Other common adverse events reported in patients receiving eribulin included alopecia (35 %), nausea (22 %), fatigue (17 %) and asthenia (15 %). Peripheral sensory neuropathy was observed in 13 % of patients (grade 3, 4 % of patients; no grade 4) [31].”

should read:

“More patients receiving eribulin had neutropenia (54 vs 16 %) and leukopenia (31 vs 10 %); other common adverse events reported in patients receiving eribulin included alopecia (35 %) and nausea (22 %) [31].”
