Emerging data have suggested that cell surface GRP78 is a multifunctional receptor and has been linked to proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling cascades. Activated α2−macroglobin (α2M*) is a natural circulating ligand of cell surface GRP78. Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis in human cancers.

Methods
The invasion and metastasis of HCC cells were examined using transwell and wound healing assay; Cell surface expression of GRP78 was detected by in cell western assay. Translocation of GRP78 from cytosol to cell surface was observed by transfection of GRP78-EGFP plus TRIRC-WGA staining. The levels of Src, phosphor-Src, FAK, phospho-FAK, EGFR, phospho-EGFR, phospho-Cortactin, phospho-Paxillin were determined by western blot. Cell surface expression of GRP78 in HCC tissue samples was observed by immunofluorescence. The distribution of Paxillin and Cortactin in HCC cells was also observed by immunofluorescence. The interaction between GRP78 and Src were detected by far-western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and GST pulldown. GRP78 mRNA was detected by RT-PCR.

Results
In the current study, we showed that association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* stimulated the invasion and metastasis of HCC. Cell surface GRP78 could interact directly with c-Src, promoted the phosphorylation of c-Src at Y416. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src with PP2 reverted the stimulatory effect caused by association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M*. Moreover, association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facilitates the interaction between EGFR and c-Src and consequently phosphorylated EGFR at Y1101 and Y845, promoting the invasion and metastasis of HCCs. However, inhibition of the tyrosine kinase of c-Src do not affect the interaction between EGFR and Src.

Conclusion
c-Src plays a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of HCC induced by association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M*. Cell surface GRP78 directly binds and phosphorylates c-Src. As a consequence, c-Src phosphorylated EGFR, promoting the invasion and metastasis of HCCs.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1]. Invasion and metastasis contributed largely to the high mortality of HCC [2]. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms regulating the invasion and metastasis is critical for searching new strategies to improve the outcome of HCC.

Human ɑ2-macroglobulin (α2M) is a typical member of the pan-proteinase inhibitors of the α2M family, which is mainly synthesized by the liver [3]. Many data have reported that α2M is overexpressed in HCC with the background of hepatitis B infection and the increased serological α2M is associated with HCC in humans, identifying α2M as a cytochemical marker for the diagnosis of HCC [4]. α2M is activated by intracellular proteinases. When activated, α2M binds directly with corresponding cell surface receptors and functions as a regulator of many signaling pathways and plays a growth factor-like role in many human cancers. So far, two cell surface receptors that specifically bind with activated α2M (α2M*) have been identified, namely cell surface glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and LDL receptor related protein (LRP) [5]. Upon most occasions, GRP78 is regarded as an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, whose major function is to fold and process the unfolded or malfolded proteins [6]. However, it is also presented on the cell surface under stress condition [7]. Cell surface GRP78 acts as a multifunctional receptor which plays critical role in the proliferation, viability and apoptosis [8, 9]. For example, association of cell-surface GRP78 with α2M* triggers MAPK and Akt signaling cascades, promoting cellular proliferation of 1-LN prostate cancer cells [3, 10, 11]. Ligation of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* activates the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, decreases p53 level and plays a stimulatory role in the proliferation and viability of prostate cancer cells [11, 12].

Although a large body of evidence has linked cell surface GRP78 to proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling cascades, little is known about the role of cell surface GRP78 in the invasion and metastasis of human cancer cells. Cellular Src (c-Src), a non–receptor protein tyrosine kinase, is overexpressed and hyperactivated in many human cancers [13, 14]. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that c-Src is implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, such as tumor invasion and metastasis, by interacting with and phosphorylating a wide range of intracellular proteins including epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) [15]. EGFR is a member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and is overexpressed in many types of human cancers including HCC [16]. Accumulating evidence has suggested that Src could form a complex and mediated EGFR phosphorylation, regulating the tumor progression [17].

In this article, we found that GRP78 is overexpressed on the cell surface in HCC tissue samples. Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* promotes the invasion and metastasis of HCC in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines QGY-7703 and PLC by stimulating the translocation of GRP78 from the cytosol to plasma. Downstream, cell surface GRP78 interacts directly with c-Src and promotes the phosphorylation of c-Src at Y416. Moreover, association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facillitates the interaction between EGFR and c-Src. As a consequence, c-Src phosphorylated EGFR at Y1101 and Y845, promoting the invasion and metastasis of HCCs.

Confluence cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS twice and serum starved for 4 h. PP2 was added for 30 min. following α2M* stimulation, EZ-link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce, USA) was added to cover the surface of the cell layer and the flasks were gently shaken at 4 °C for 30 min. The biotinylation reaction was stopped by adding Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration to 100 nM. Then, the cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS twice and then lysed with RIPA buffer and Neutravidin-agarose beads (Pierce, USA) were added in whole cell lysate overnight and incubated at 4 °C with agitation. The beads were washed for 5 times with PBS buffer. The cell surface proteins were released by 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The cell surface proteins were subjected to western blotting analysis.

Results
Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facilitated the invasion and metastasis of HCC
Increasing data have linked α2M* to pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic role. However, whether it plays a role in the invasiveness and metastasis of HCC remains unknown. To investigate the role of α2M* in tumor invasion, QGY-7703 and PLC cells were serum starved for 4 h, followed by stimulation with α2M* for 30 min (50 pM) [10]. Using transwell assay, we found that treatment of QGY-7703 and PLC cells with α2M* caused significant increase in the invasiveness relative to that in cells treated with vehicle, indicating that α2M* stimulation facilitates the invasion of QGY-7703 (Fig. 1a) and PLC cells (Fig. 1b). We next assessed whether α2M* modulate the metastasis of cancer cells using wound healing assay and found that stimulation with α2M* significantly facilitated the metastasis of QGY-7703 (Fig. 1c) and PLC cells (Fig. 1d).Fig. 1 Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facilitated the invasion and metastasis of HCC.

The difference is regarded to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. *represented that the difference is statistically significant



To investigate whether cell surface GRP78 is the surrogate of α2M* in this process, serum starved QGY-7703 and PLC cells were pretreated with the antibody directed against the NH2-termnial domain (NTD), COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of GRP78 or isotype IgG for 1 h followed by α2M* stimulation [25, 26]. Transwell assay revealed that pretreatment with the GRP78 NTD antibody caused a marked decrease in the invasion potential as compared with vehicle upon α2M* stimulation. However, pretreatment with CTD had no effect on the invasion potential as compared with pretreatment with isotype IgG or vehicle upon α2M* stimulation (Fig. 1e-g). Using cell adhesion assay, we found that blockade of cell surface GRP78 with the NTD antibody decreased the binding ability of tumor cells to fibronectin in QGY-7703 cells (Fig. 1h). These data suggested that cell surface is the surrogate of α2M* and cell surface GRP78 promotes the invasion and metastasis by its NH2-terminal domain.

α2M* induced GRP78 translocation from cytosol to cell surface in HCC
We next determined whether α2M* affected the cell surface expression of GRP78 in QGY-7703 and PLC cells. Serum starved QGY-7703 and PLC cells were treated with α2M* and vehicle. Using in cell western assay, cell surface and total GRP78 were determined with or without Tween 20 permeabilization. We found that α2M* stimulation significantly elevated the cell surface faction of GRP78, whereas did not affect total GRP78 in QGY-7703 and PLC cells (Fig. 2a). In QGY-7703 cells, α2M* stimulation caused a ~2.7 fold increase in the cell surface expression of GRP78 as compared with vehicle. In PLC cells, a ~2.1 fold increase was observed upon α2M* stimulation (Fig. 2b). Using RT-PCR, we found that GRP78 mRNA levels in cells treated with α2M* were similar with that in QGY-7703 and PLC cells treated with vehicle (Fig. 2c). These data suggested that the elevated expression of cell surface GRP78 is not regulated at transcriptional and translational level and raised the possibility that α2M* could induce the translocation of GRP78 from cytosol to plasma membrane. To answer this question, we transiently transfected GRP78-EGFP into QGY-7703 cells [27]. After 48 h of transfection, exogenous and endogenous GRP78 were examined using western blot (Fig. 2d). QGY-7703 cells transfected with GRP78-EGFP were serum starved for 4 h, followed by α2M* stimulation, stained with TRITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (TRITC-WGA), a specific plasma membrane dye. Using confocal microscopy, we found that GRP78 colocalized with TRITC-WGA on the cell surface (yellow on the cell surface) in α2M* treated cells. By contrast, the colocalization of GRP78 and TRITC-WGA was not observed in cells treated with vehicle (Fig. 2e). These data demonstrated that α2M* induces the translocation of GRP78 from cytosol to cell surface.Fig. 2 α2M* induced GRP78 translocation from cytosol to cell surface in HCC.

c-Src interacts directly with GRP78 on the cell surface of HCCs
We have previously reported that cell surface GRP78 facilitates the invasion of HCC [28]. To further extend this finding, we sought to determine the downstream target of cell surface GRP78. For this purpose, we compared tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in serum starved QGY-7703 cells treated with α2M* or vehicle. As determined by western blot using anti-p-Tyr antibody. A tyrosine phosphorylated band migrating at ~60 KDa was significantly induced in QGY-7703 cells treated with α2M*, suggesting that cell surface GRP78 may regulate the phosphorylation of a unknown tyrosine kinase whose molecular weight is ~60 KDa (Fig. 3a). Based on this result, we tried to determine whether cell surface GRP78 regulated the activity of c-Src in HCCs. We first identified GRP78 binding proteins in the whole cell lysates from QGY-7703 and PLC cells by far-western blotting using the biotin-conjugated rhGRP78 as the bait. For this purpose, we isolated plasma membrane proteins using cell surface protein biotinylation assay and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiment using the anti-GRP78 antibody (Abcam). As shown in Fig. 3b, a protein, migrating at ~60 kDa, could interact specifically with the biotin-conjugated rhGRP78. Moreover, we subjected the precipitated proteins to SDS-PAGE and found a ~60 kDa band in the precipitated proteins. Western blotting showed that c-Src is presented in the proteins co-precipitated with GRP78, suggesting that the cell surface GRP78 modulates the activity of Src by direct interaction (Fig. 3c). Finally, we performed GST-pulldown assay to verify the interaction between cell surface GRP78 and c-Src using GST-GRP78 as the bait. We found that a ~60 kDa band by SDS-PAGE and identified that this protein was c-Src by western blot (Fig. 3d).Fig. 3 c-Src interacts directly with GRP78 on the cell surface of HCCs.

Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* activates c-Src and its downstream signaling pathways
Using western blot, we examined p-Src phosphorylation at Y416 in cell lysates from serum starved QGY-7703 and PLC cells treated with α2M* or vehicle. We found that α2M* stimulation significantly increased p-c-Src levels as compared with vehicle in both QGY-7703 and PLC cells, indicating that cell surface GRP78 facilitates c-Src phosphorylation in HCC (Fig. 4a). We next determined whether the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src is involved in the regulation of adhesion and invasion of HCC cells in QGY-7703 cells. Serum starved QGY-7703 cells were pretreated with PP2 at a concentration of 10 μM for 30 min followed by α2M* stimulation. Cell adhesion assay revealed that pretreatment of serum starved QGY-7703 cells with PP2 caused a significant decrease in binding ability to fibronectin as compared with vehicle upon α2M* stimulation. No difference was observed between cells treated with PP2 alone and cells treated with PP2 followed by α2M* stimulation (Fig. 4b). The invasion potentials were analyzed using transwell assay. As shown in Fig. 4c, pretreatment of serum starved QGY-7703 cells with PP2 caused a marked decrease in the invasion potential as compared with vehicle upon α2M* stimulation. It is worth to note that QGY-7703 cells treated with PP2 alone share similar inhibitory extent on tumor invasion as compared with cells pretreated with PP2 followed by α2M* stimulation. Similar results were obtained in PLC cells (Fig. 4d-e). These data suggested that c-Src is the downstream signaling molecule of α2M*. We also examined whether cell surface GRP78 could activate c-Src downstream signaling pathways [29]. As shown in Fig. 4f, treatment of serum starved QGY-7703 and PLC cells with α2M* caused significant increase in the phosphorylation levels of FAK (Y397), Cortactin (Y486 and 466) and Paxillin (Y118) as compared with vehicle treated cells.Fig. 4 Association of Cell surface GRP78 with α2M* activates c-Src and its downstream signaling pathways.

The difference is regarded to be statistically significant when p < 0.05. *represented that the difference is statistically significant



Although many data have demonstrated that α2M* could bind with cell surface GRP78 and stimulate the signaling pathways downstream of cell surface expression of GRP78, we still need to preclude the possibility that α2M* binds with other cell surface protein and facilitates c-Src phosphorylation. To obtain this goal, serum starved QGY-7703 and PLC cells were incubated with the antibody directed against the NH2-termnial domain (NTD) or COOH-terminal domain (CTD) of GRP78 for 1 h prior to α2M* stimulation. Many reports by other groups have demonstrated that the antibodies we used could block the binding of cell surface GRP78 with α2M*. Western blot analysis showed significantly lower pY416-Src and pY397-FAK levels in cells pretreated with NTD antibody as compared with cells pretreated with isotype IgG upon α2M* stimulation. However, pretreatment with CTD antibody did not affect pY416-Src and pY397-FAK levels (Fig. 4g). These data suggested that cell surface GRP78 is the surrogate of α2M* induced c-Src phosphorylation and activates c-Src via its NH2-terminal domain.

Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* induces invadopodia formation and Paxillin redistribution
Invadopodia is a specialized invasive organelle for tumor cells undergoing invasion and metastasis [30]. To investigate whether cell surface GRP78 regulates the formation of invadopodia, the distribution of Cortactin in serum starved QGY-7703 cells treated with α2M* or vehicle was observed using immunofluorescence [21]. By co-staining of Cortactin and F-actin, we observed that treatment with α2M* caused a marked increase in the number of speckles in cell cortex as compared with that treated with vehicle, while pretreatment with PP2 significantly decreased the number of speckles on cell cortex. Furthermore, α2M* stimulation caused a subtle increase the number of speckles in cell cortex in PP2 pretreated cells, indicating that c-Src is essential for the formation of invadopodia induced by association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* (Fig. 5).Fig. 5 Association of Cell surface GRP78 with α2M* induces invadopodia formation. QGY-7703 cells were treated with vehicle, α2M*, PP2 or PP2 in combination with α2M* and co-stained with TRITC-conjugated Phalloidin and anti-Cortactin antibody. The distribution of F-actin (red) and cortactin (green) was observed using a confocal microscope. The invadopodia was indicated as yellow patches. Scale Bar 25 μm



We also observed whether association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* could cause the redistribution of Paxillin. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that Paxillin exhibited a dense punctate distribution on the cell periphery in serum starved QGY-7703 cells treated with α2M*as compared with that treated with vehicle, indicating that cell surface GRP78 induced the redistribution of Paxillin. Pretreatment with PP2 decreased the cell periphery distribution. Moreover, α2M* stimulation caused a moderate increase in the cell periphery distribution of Paxillin in PP2 pretreated cells, indicating the critical role of c-Src in Paxillin redistribution caused by association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* (Fig. 6).Fig. 6 Association of Cell surface GRP78 with α2M* induces paxillin formation.

Association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facillitated the maximal activation of EGFR in a c-Src dependent manner
For the critical role of EGFR in the invasion and metastasis of HCC, we wonder whether cell surface GRP78 could regulate EGFR phosphorylation. For this purpose, we examined EGFR phosphorylation levels at Y1068, Y845 and Y1101 in serum starved QGY-7703 cells treated with α2M* or vehicle. Using western blot, we found that α2M* stimulation significantly increased the phosphorylation level of EGFR at Y1068, Y845 and Y1101 as compared with vehicle, while did not affect EGFR expression. Pretreatment of serum starved QGY-7703 cells with PP2 caused a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of EGFR at Y845 and Y1101 as compared with cells pretreatment with vehicle upon α2M* stimulation. However, PP2 treatment did not affected EGFR phosphorylation at Y1068 (Fig. 7a, b).Fig. 7 Association of Cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facilitated the maximal activation of EGFR in a c-Src dependent manner.

Accumulating evidence has shown that EGFR is a downstream signaling molecule of c-Src and c-Src could directly bind with EGFR and activate EGFR [31, 32, 17]. We next determined whether cell surface GRP78 could regulate the interaction between EGFR and c-Src. For this purpose, whole cell lysates from serum starved QGY-7703 cells treated with α2M* or vehicle were immuonprecipitated with excessive anti-EGFR antibody (~5 μg in a 1 ml volume containing 1 mg of total protein). The precipitations were subjected to western blot analysis and we found that c-Src level in the whole cell lysate from α2M* treated cells was higher than that from vehicle treated cells. It is worth to note that c-Src was not detected in isotope IgG precipitation. These data indicated that cell surface GRP78 facilitates the interaction between EGFR and c-Src (Fig. 7c). These data raised the question whether the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src is essential for the interaction between EGFR and c-Src induced by cell surface GRP78. Using Co-immuoprecipitation in the lysates from serum starved QGY-7703 cells pretreated with PP2 or vehicle prior to α2M* stimulation, we found that the amount of c-Src co-immunoprecipitated with EGFR in the whole cell lysate from PP2 pretreated cells were paralleled with that from cells pretreated with vehicle, indicating that the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src is not essential for the interaction between EGFR and c-Src (Fig. 7c, d).

GRP78 is highly expressed on the cell surface in tissue samples of HCC
Using immunofluorescence, we observed the cellular localization of GRP78 in ten cases of paired surgically resected HCC tissue samples. We found that GRP78 is expressed both in the cytosol and on the cell surface in 9 of 10 cases HCC tissue samples (Fig. 8c, d). By contrast, cell surface staining of GRP78 was not observed (7 of 10 cases) or very weak (3 of 10 cases) of paired peri-cancer tissue samples (Fig. 8a, b). Statistical chi-square test revealed that the difference is significant (p < 0.01). These data demonstrated that GRP78 is highly expressed on the cell surface of HCC.Fig. 8 Cell surface GRP78 expression in tissue samples of HCC. Immunofluorescence analysis of GRP78 expression in 10 cases paired HCC samples. GRP78 is localized on the cell surface in HCC tissue samples (b) and (d). On the contrary, it is not expressed (c) or expressed at very low level (a) in paired peri-cancer tissue samples. Scale Bar 25 μm



Discussion
Cell surface GRP78 has been implicated in the progression of many human cancers including melanoma, breast, prostate cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma [9]. Lots of data have linked cell surface GRP78 to pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathway [33]. However, the role of cell surface GRP78 in tumor invasion and metastasis remains poor documented. In this article, we stimulated hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines PLC and QGY-7703 with α2M* and demonstrated that c-Src is the surrogate in cell surface GRP78 induced tumor invasion and metastasis. Cell surface GRP78 facilitated the phosphorylation of c-Src at Y416 via direct interaction.

Although many data have identified α2M* as a natural ligand of cell surface GRP78, the mechanism by which α2M* activates cell surface GRP78 remains unclear. Here, we found that α2M* did not augment GRP78 expression at transcriptional and translational levels. Based on these results, we hypothesized that elevated presence of GRP78 on the cell surface may be caused by GRP78 redistribution. In consistent with our hypothesis, we demonstrated that α2M* could induce GRP78 translocation from cytosol to plasma. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cell surface GRP78 is the surrogate of α2M* induced invasion and metastasis in HCC. It is the NH2-terminal domain of GRP78 but not the COOH-terminal domain played critical role in tumor invasion and metastasis. Other reports have demonstrated the critical roles of COOH-terminal domain of GRP78 in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis in many types of human cancers including melanoma, breast and prostate cancers [3, 10, 34]. For example, ligation of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* promotes the proliferation of cancer cells in prostate cancer cells, blockade of cell surface GRP78 using the antibody against the COOH-terminal domain of GRP78 reverted the pro-proliferative effect of α2M* [10, 11, 35, 36]. Taken together, these data suggested that cell surface GRP78 regulated the invasion, metastasis, proliferation and apoptosis with different mechanism. That is the NH2-terminal domain of GRP78 is involved in the regulation of tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the COOH-terminal domain of GRP78 is involved in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells.

Further investigation of potential downstream molecules of cell surface GRP78 revealed that cell surface GRP78 could interact directly with a ~60KDa protein and augment its phosphorylation in QGY-7703 and PLC cells. Furthermore, we identified the ~60KDa protein as c-Src. These raised the question of how cell surface GRP78 and c-Src interaction affected the invasion and metastasis of HCC. To answer this question, we analyzed whether pretreatment with PP2 could inhibit α2M* induced adhesion and invasion in QGY-7703 cells. We found that inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src inhibited α2M* induced adhesion and invasion. The inhibitory extents were paralleled in cells treated with PP2 with or without α2M* stimulation. We further found that blockade of cell surface GRP78 using the antibody against the NH2 terminal domain of GRP78 inhibited the phosphorylation of Src at Y416 and FAK at Y397. However, the antibody against the COOH terminal domain of GRP78 did not affect Src and FAK phosphorylation. These data further demonstrated that the NH2-domain of cell surface GRP78 is involved in the regulation of tumor invasion and metastasis upon α2M* stimulation. Conflicting results have been described regarding the role of the NH2-terminal domain of GRP78 in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis. In NCCIT cells, blockade of Cripto binding to cell surface GRP78 using the antibody against the NH2-terminal domain inhibited tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that the NH2-terminal domain of cell surface GRP78 also plays a pro-proliferative role in NCCIT cells [26]. This could be explained by the difference in ligands that bind with GRP78 [37, 38]. This opinion was supported by the fact that binding of cell surface GRP78 with Par-4 played an pro-apoptotic role in prostate cancer [25, 39].

We also found that ligation of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* triggered EGFR signaling pathway in a Src-dependent manner. Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity inhibited EGFR phosphorylation at Y1101 and Y845 induced by α2M* stimulation. However, treatment of PP2 did not inhibit the phosphorylation at Y1068, indicating that Src plays critical role in the maximal activation of EGFR in HCC. This raised the question of how c-Src may regulate EGFR activity induced by the association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M*. Other reports have demonstrated that Src could regulate EGFR activity by direct interaction. We found that association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M* facilitated the interaction between c-Src and EGFR. Furthermore, inhibition of the tyrosine kinase did not affect the interaction between c-Src and EGFR. However, inhibition of Src tyrosine kinase activity inhibiting the maximal activation of EGFR by preventing the phosphorylation of EGFR at Y845 and Y1101. These data were consistent with the role of c-Src in EGFR activation and suggested that both tyrosine kinase activity and protein binding function of Src are essential for cell surface GRP78 induced EGFR activation.

Conclusion
Our research revealed that c-Src plays a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of HCC induced by association of cell surface GRP78 with α2M*. Cell surface GRP78 directly binds and phosphorylates c-Src. As a consequence, c-Src phosphorylated EGFR, promoting the invasion and metastasis of HCCs.
