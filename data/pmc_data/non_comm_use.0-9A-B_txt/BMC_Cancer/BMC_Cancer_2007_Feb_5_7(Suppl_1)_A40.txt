Background
The risk of non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is 150–250 times higher among HIV infected patients. In developed countries with open access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the prognosis of these patients appears to be impacted positively, and survival in some groups can be similar to non-HIV infected patients. Recent data has shown improved survival among NHL-HIV+ patients receiving standard chemotherapy (QT) HAART, with acceptable range of toxicity.

Objective
To analyze the median survival of patients with AIDS with and without NHL and NHL-HIV negative patients.

Materials and methods
We etrospectively reviewed all medical records of patients with NHL-HIV+ seen from January 1990 to December 2005 at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia in Mexico City, Mexico. We used as control groups patients with AIDS (defining-event non-lymphoma related), and patients with NHL treated as well at our institution, diagnosis made ± 3 years, with same gender and age ± 5 years. We recorded clinical, laboratory and pathology data; survival or follow-up time was calculated from date of diagnosis to death or to the date when the patient was last seen.

Results
Sixty-nine patients were diagnosed with NHL-HIV. AIDS control patients (n = 93) were divided into no-HAART and HAART; and NHL/HIV negative control patients (n = 90) were divided into incomplete (<3 cycles or <100% of total dose), and complete chemotherapy (Table 1)

Conclusion
Survival in patients with AIDS is better than in NHL/HIV+ and NHL/HIV-. The use of HAART has significantly improved sthe prognosis. Mean survival with the use of a complete chemotherapy regime is similar in patients with NHL and in patients with NHL/HIV+.
