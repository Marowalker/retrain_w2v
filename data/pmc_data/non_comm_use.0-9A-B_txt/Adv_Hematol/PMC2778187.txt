Dye or solvent exposures are important both in bladder cancer (BC) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Here a case with BC and HCL has been presented and literature has been reviewed.
==== Body
1. Case Report
A 53-year-old man referred to our unit due to severe pancytopenia and splenomegaly. 
He had the history of pain during urination and hematuria for the last 2 years. 
He admitted to a urologist and bladder malignancy had been thought with abdominopelvic
ultrasonographic examination. This US 
 showed bladder wall thickness at
the right-lower portion and massive splenomegaly with space occupying lesions
in it, and it had been reported as BC and massive splenomegaly, probably spleen
metastasis due to BC. PET/CT had been
done and it showed thickening in bladder wall and splenomegaly with homogenous,
low FDG uptake.

TUR had been
performed due to BC by his urologist. After surgery, Mitomycin C instillation
was given weekly for 4 weeks and one injection in every six months for
four times is then given. After these he admitted to our unit with pancytopenia and
splenomegaly.

His personal
history was interesting for chemical exposure: he was interested with music and
he was guitar player for years. He had the history of sellulosic dye exposure
due to his professional job. He had the history of smoking and alcohol
ingestion daily (whisky and Turkish raki) for 25 years.

Physical
examination showed pallor and splenomegaly 8 cm below the left costal margin.

Abnormal laboratory tests are Hb: 7 g/dL, Hct: 21%, WBC: 9.2 × 109/lt with 5.7%
neutrophil and 70% lymphoid cells, platelet: 64 × 109/lt, ESR: 36 mm/h,
ALP: 525 IU/L, GGT: 267 IU/L. Peripheral blood smear showed abnormal lymphoid
cells with cytoplasmic projections and these cells were TRAP (+) compatible
with HCL.

Bone marrow
biopsy showed grade III fibrosis and lymphoid infiltration and these cells were
CD20 (+), TRAP (+).

Management
Cladribine 0.1 mg/Kg daily for 7 days was given on December 2007. At the last
visit on May 2008, his physical examination and complete blood count were
within normal limits (Hb: 13.2 g/dL, Hct: 39.4%, WBC: 4.3 × 109/lt, neutrophil
count: 2.65 × 109/lt, platelet: 177 × 109/lt.



2. Discussion
Urothelial
cancer and dye exposure is an old history. The association between chemical
exposure and BC is proposed classically but epidemiologic data is variable. 
When we enter the pubmed with “Bladder cancer and chemical” key words, it
shows 795 papers. It has been reported in many papers that every type
of exposure to chemicals (from
occupational exposure to personal hair dyes or drinking water) may contribute
to the occurrence of BC [1–5].

On
the other hand, exposure to petroleum products and HCL is another aspect of the
chemical exposure and cancer. First
report about the chronic benzene exposure and HCL has been presented by Turkish
Hematologist Aksoy [6]. After
this observation, additional papers have been published about HCL and chemical
exposures. However, due to the relative rarity of HCL the data about the
association between chemical exposure and HCL, is limited. Male predominance in
HCL (4/1) has been noticed by several groups, and this suggested the probability
of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, benzene, and other solvents [7, 8]. In a case-control study covering 291 cases (229 men, 62 women) and 541
controls, there was a positive association between exposures to organic
solvents or self-declared exposures to solvents and HCL [9]. In 2 case-control
studies only male cases have been included. In the first study covering 111 male
cases and 400 controls, there has been found elevated levels of antibodies to the
EBV early antigen in HCL cases compared to controls. ORs were found to be
elevated in cases with early antigen IgA and to have a history of exposure to
environmental solvents, certain pesticides, impregnating agents, animals and exhausts
[10]. In the second study, 121 male HCL cases and 484 controls have been
included. Elevated OR was found for exposure to farm animals in general (OR:
2.0, CI: 1.2–2.3), exposure to herbicides (OR: 2.9, CI: 1.4–5.9), insecticides
(OR: 2, CI: 1.1–3.5), fungicides (OR: 3.8, CI: 1.4–9.9), impregnating agents
(OR: 2.4, CI: 1.3–4.6), organic solvents (OR: 1.5, CI: 0.99–2.3), and exhausted
fumes (OR: 2.1, CI: 1.3–3.3) showed increased risk. In this study multivariate
analysis showed elevated ORs for all these exposures with the exception of
insecticides [11]. There are some
smaller case-control studies evaluating HCL and chemical exposure. A study covering 45 cases and their neighborhoods evaluated exposure to organic chemicals in
the workplace and there was significantly greater exposure in cases than
controls (RR: 3.10). Employment in the woodworking or farming was of borderline
significance. In this cohort there was a significant risk in farm birthplace
(RR: 4.20), migraine (RR: 4.80), infectious mononucleosis (RR: 9), routine use
of aspirin (RR: 3.41), and tranquilizers (RR: 4.5) [12]. In another case-control
study covering 50 cases and 95 controls, there has been found an important risk
between HCL and exposure to organic solvents, petrochemicals, and related
products [13]. When evaluated generally, cigarette smoking was associated with
reduced or no risk of HCL and this was an interesting point of these studies [8, 11, 12].

In
our case there was the history of dye exposure and double cancer that the
etio-pathogenetic role of dye has been shown in both. This case is interesting
due to 2 reasons:


				coexistence of HCL and BC in a case with the history of
exposure to dye is interesting,

epidemiologic data about the dye exposure and HCL is relevant,
but we need additional epidemiological studies and/or meta-analysis about
chemical exposures and HCL.
