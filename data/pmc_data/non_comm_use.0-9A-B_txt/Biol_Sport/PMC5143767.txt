INTRODUCTION
Over the past century, the use of exercise, e.g., endurance exercise (ET), resistance exercise (RT), or endurance and resistance combined (E+R), has become a common treatment method for improving body composition and health status of individual who are overfat, i.e. the individual with health issues arising from excessive body fat and not from body mass index (BMI) classification of obese or overweight, or for those individuals with metabolic issues, e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus or MetS [1, 2]. Resulting in a multitude of institutional position stands and exercise programs (with or without a concurrent change in diet) in an attempt to improve the overall health status and body composition for individuals who are overfat or with metabolic syndrome (T2DM) [3–11]. Each developed in the global effort to deal with the epidemic rise in the rate of overfatness (and the associated health issues) within the global population, universally based on the premise that doing any type of activity is better than doing no activity at all [7–9, 12]. That is furthered by the postulate that increasing overall level of physical activity for the individual who is overfat will ultimately produce a change in behavior that alters an unhealthy lifestyle into a healthy lifestyle [5, 10].

However, issues arise related to the ideal of exercise incorporation into treatment for the individual who is overfat. Principally, given the known value of exercise, why does exercise have such a poor attrition rate in the utilization and compliance with the recommendation for exercise by the population as a whole [13–15]? An answer to which most likely stems from multiple factors, notably the application bias by health professionals coupled to the social stigma individuals who are overfat face in the development of exercise programs [14, 16–19]. Which combine with the limited appreciation for the complexity of exercise, or responses to exercise, that impact the individual’s physiology leading to the changes in overall health status of the individual who is overfat [1, 2, 20]. The former may limit the draw that the individual has to exercise while the latter limits the ability to design exercise programs based on a periodization model [21, 22] that would allow for modification of the level of stimulus across the duration of training. A model of application that is necessary for continual physiological, and morphological, adaptations and improvements in overall health status to take place [2, 14]. Ultimately, poor exercise design and application limits the ability to modify long-term health behaviors required to encourage the modifications necessary to convert the overfat individual from a diseased health status to a non-diseased health status [1, 5, 8]. Thereby, producing the poor attrition and compliance with exercise programs.

While a recent meta analysis has indicated differences in effectiveness between methods of exercise, based on level of total muscle stimulation that favors use of higher levels of training stimulus over lower-levels [23]. In which, higher level stimulus from resistance training (e.g., hypertrophic patterning) shows as being the most effective pattern of training stimulus for inducing changes in morphology and health status of the individual who is overfat [23]. Yet, there appears to be a bias in the promotion of methods of exercise at low overall stimulus versus those of higher level of stimulus. Along with a premise that any increase in activity has benefit and that exercise methods generate a similar level of adaptation, if we just give it enough time [9, 19, 24–26]. Generating a mismatch of unrealistic expectations for outcome from exercise, as stimulus generally promoted is not high enough to produce changes generally desired, along with a lack of modification within the training stimulus to provide for continual and progressive modifications to both body composition and health status. Thus, leading to the poor adherence and lower attrition rate to multiple methods of exercise for individuals who are overfat or at risk for metabolic issues [13–15]. And may explain the cyclic behavior of repetitive attempts of, and withdrawals from, various exercise methods to fulfill the want of improved overall health of the individual who is overfat.

Thus we are left with questions about the means by which to prescribe exercise based on how long must one engages in these methods of exercise to stipulate that a program works? And if it takes disproportionately longer for one program to work, is it actually as effective as another program? Where answers can allow us to determine the time course for overall effectiveness from different methods of exercise and therefore develop first a time course for goal setting and secondly, a method for the periodization of training. That will allow for us to provide an exercise program that provides the greatest degree of benefit and the changes in long-term patterns of physical activity and exercise behaviors to alter the overall health status of the individual who is overfat, or susceptible to metabolic issues.

Therefore, the purpose here is to expand upon previous reports of effectiveness [23] related to changes in body composition and issue of overall health status of the individual who is overfat based on the duration of exercise. Testing the hypothesis that the relative benefit obtained from exercise will become more effective with prolonged exposure to any of the exercise modalities, e.g., endurance, resistance, or combination of endurance and resistance training. And secondarily, inclusion of resistance exercise within training program will continue to show a greater level of effectiveness for eliciting responses across all durations examined for each measures of interest. Where the aim this study is to evaluate observational, tracking and random-control trials to address the impact that the duration of exercise has on its relative effectiveness for inducing health and body compositional changes in individuals who are overfat. So as to provide an understanding as to what, if any, differences exist across the duration of exercise that is required for development of a periodized program of exercise prescription. While also providing the information necessary for developing both the short and long-term goals for the exercise protocols for individuals who are overfat.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The meta-analysis is a continuation of analysis that has been previously detailed [23] examining the random-effect pooled effect size (ES) for responses in adults who are overfat, clustered for the duration of exercise used in treatment. In which relevant studies (e.g., studies only involving human volunteers within population based research models) were retrieved from electronic database search engines (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Scopus) through the end of February 2014. Where the searches were conducted based on the key word human, with a combination of any (or all) of the following: obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, exercise, resistance training or resistance exercise, endurance training or aerobic exercise, strength training, diet, insulin, obesity, weight loss, fat mass, and fat-free mass. From the 3,500 total journal articles, see PRISMA information in supplemental figure 1, returned by the search engines and following the initial screening a total of 92 studies were included based on the following criteria into the meta-analysis:

Exclusion criteria
Publication was a review article

Not published in English or no translation available

Study design utilized an animal model for the problem

Due to the inability to blind participants to whether or not the individual has been exposed to exercise, studies were not excluded by the criteria of random-control blinding to treatment.

From the 92 studies, 200 study-groupings were developed for comparison of responses within the review across the duration of studies and then chronological time of continuous training. These groupings were based on study demographics, e.g., age, gender, overfatness and disease state, followed by the method of exercise indicated, e.g., endurance (ET), resistance (RT), or endurance and resistance combined (E+R) and then by indication of relative intensity of training. Classification of exercise was performed, regardless of additional dietary intervention to the exercise regimen, as it was previously noted that diet (except for lower carbohydrate diet) had a minimal overall impact on the exercise’s level of effectiveness for adaptations in measures of interest analyzed here [23]. After entry of study demographics, each study was identified by the duration of exercise intervention, by total number of weeks of training, and the group size for human volunteers within each group for that study. After which the reported averages (pre-, and post-, test) and standard deviations of each test for all measures of interest (e.g., body mass (BM), fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), body mass index (BMI), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, aerobic fitness (VO2max), [insulin]pl, [glucose]pl, [glycated hemoglobin (A1c)]pl, [adiponectin]pl, [leptin]pl, [c-reactive protein (CRP)]pl, and [tumor necrotic factor- α (TNF-α)]pl) were entered into the data table. To determine the progressive change in ES within and between exercise methods for eliciting changes in these measures studies were clustered based on the length of investigation for each study included at ≤8-weeks (19-studies [27–45], group size: 19±6.4, age: 45±10.2, female:male ratio: 1.6), 9-15 weeks (29-studies [46–73], group size: 19±22, age: 47±10.4 , female:male ratio: 1.3), 16-23 weeks (16-studies [44, 74–88], group size: 15±11.4, age: 52±9.5, female:male ratio: 1.3), 24-36 weeks (14-studies [35, 71, 77, 89–99], group size: 41±27.9, age: 55±6.3, female:male ratio 0.9) and >36-weeks (15-studies [77, 89, 91, 100–111], group size: 53±46.4, age: 46±9.2, female:male ratio: 1.14), see supplemental table 1, and then grouped within these clusters by 4-week increments of continuous training for examination of within grouping changes.

Analysis of tabulated results was performed to determine the degree of skew (that is only due to publication bias toward only reporting the positive findings and dissimilar exercise parameters within studies) within the responses to assess the likelihood of continuing analysis utilizing aggregate pooled effect based on the method previously utilized [23, 112]. There was an active attempt to limit the selection bias of studies included by examining all study methods used to evaluate intervention programs that used exercise, beyond the classically desired random-controlled and clinical trails. In this effort, population demographics were also evaluated to ensure that populations within each study was not so restrictive as to limit the generalizability of the findings provided by the authors of that study. Based on such analysis, bias in the data indicated that relative effectiveness for eliciting changes must be conducted utilizing a non-parametric, non-uniform method for the determination of ES across and between methods of exercise for the durations performed. Where all grouped analysis is based on the assumption of random-effect pooled effect size, similar to what this author previously performed and reported on [23, 112, 113]. The determined pooled ES, and resultant confidence intervals (CI.95) of ES was determined, to examine the overall effect relative to a case of no change (i.e. ES=0.00 or a CI.95 for ES crossing zero within range for expected responses) as previously described [23, 112].

The comparisons analyzed here are based on each of the following 1) within and across all the various exercise modalities, e.g., all exercise (All Ex), endurance exercise (ET), resistance exercise (RT), or combination of endurance and resistance (E+R), based on clustering of groups within 4-week increments of training duration from 4-weeks to 40-weeks and then at 52-weeks of exercise training; 2) within all the various exercise modalities, e.g., All Ex, ET, RT, or E+R, based on clustering of groups of study durations (≤8-weeks, 9-15 weeks, 16-23 weeks, 24-36 weeks and 52-weeks); and 3) differences between exercise modality (e.g., ET versus RT, ET versus E+R, RT versus E+R) based on clustering of groups of study durations (≤8-weeks, 9-15 weeks, 16-23 weeks, 24-36 weeks and 52-weeks). With results indicated as ES (CI.95 low value, CI.95 high value) when significant differences were noted, i.e. ES ≠ 0, and where CI.95 did not include 0 within the range for ES.

In an effort to establish a secondary directionality for difference between exercise treatments, the within study treatment ES, (μpost-treatment-μpre-treatment)/(σpre-treatment), were then clustered for 4x4 χ2 analysis to determine if there was any difference in the level of response between methods of exercise. In which the χ2 analysis was utilized through identification of number of greater effectiveness and number of lesser effectiveness within each exercise and duration group based comparison to study’s ability to elicit a greater, or lesser, level of effectiveness relative to the pooled effectiveness of comparison (i.e. ET versus RT, ET versus E+R, RT versus E+R) and a diet-only intervention that has been previously reported [23].

RESULTS
As indicated in figure 1-5 and supplemental figures 2-4, the responses for effectiveness (ES) in eliciting changes follows the trend of continuum for a differential level of ES toward eliciting beneficial responses based on the duration of training both within and between the methods of exercise, table 1. The spectrum of overall beneficial effect (i.e. ES≠0, or CI.95 of ES not including 0.00) both within and between methods of exercise appears to wane and plateau as training progresses into ever-longer durations. As comparisons show that shorter duration training appear to be more effective than the moderate and longer durations and moderate duration training more effective than the longer durations.

Note: Note that comparisons based on endurance versus resistance training methods (El v. RT), endurance versus combination of endurance and resistance training methods (ET v. E+R), combination of endurance and resistance versus resistance training methods (E + R v RT). Negative (-) values indicate favor toward the second exercise group in the comparison between the methods of exercise, while ‘---‘ indicates indicates not enough studies in the group to determine pooled effect size and CI.95.

Comparing the elicited responses within each study analyzed indications for differential ES favoring a specific type of exercise based on the duration of the exercise within the individual study relative to the ES from diet (previously reported [23]) or in comparison to the pooled ES for the methods of exercise being compared. One such indication is RT’s ability to elicit a larger ES for altering DBP and glucose at longer durations (beyond 36-weeks) relative to ET (χ2=3.48, p=0.02 and χ2=3.49, p=0.04, respectively). Along with trends favoring RT for altering glucose through the moderate duration (up to 24-weeks) of training relative to ET, χ2=1.28 (p=0.12), and E+R (up to16-weeks), χ2=1.49 (p=0.13), and for changes in fasting insulin levels relative to ET, χ2=1.77 (p=0.14). Moreover, RT has a trend for being more effective at shorter durations (up to 8-weeks) for altering FFM and through the moderate durations (up to 24-weeks) for altering FM than ET, χ2=1.24 (p=0.15) and χ2=1.38 (p=0.12) respectively. Whereas, E+R trends toward being more effective than ET for altering FM through the moderate duration (up to16-weeks), χ2=1.31 (p=0.12), and after longer durations (beyond 36-weeks), χ2=1.77 (p=0.12), along with eliciting alterations in insulin, χ2=2.11 (p=0.11), after longer durations (beyond 36-weeks).

Effectiveness related to ability to elicit changes in morphology
Exercise has a greater ES at shorter and moderate durations, than at longer durations, with no indication for possible beneficial effects in changes of body morphology (BM, FM or FFM) occurring for each method of exercise until after 12-weeks of continuous training with changes in BMI not indicating a total beneficial effect until after 16-weeks, figure 1 and supplemental figure 2. The greatest ES for altering any measure of body morphology, with the exception of FFM, occurring at a training duration of 16-23 weeks, with the greatest ES for altering BM continues through 36-weeks of training, ES=0.47 (0.17, 0.78). Within the grouping analysis for each type of exercise notes that the use of RT and E+R appear to be more effective than ET, however the CI.95 can have an ES of 0 and thus differences may not be significantly more effective for all duration, figure 1 and supplemental figure 2. RT becomes effective (i.e., CI.95 always favoring treatment) at altering FM within the shorter training duration, ≤8-weeks, and all other measures of morphology at 9-15 weeks, while ET and E+R develop similar beneficial effectiveness after moderate and longer duration training periods, e.g., beyond 16-weeks of continuous training, regardless of the measures of body morphology being examined, figure 1 and supplemental figure 2.

The comparison between methods, see table 1, indicates that E+R and ET were more effective than RT for altering BM at moderate durations (24-36 weeks). RT is more effective than both ET and E+R at altering FM at 9-15 weeks and 24-36 weeks of training. Additionally, RT was more effective than ET at altering FFM at training duration ≤ 8-weeks, 0.27 (0.01, 0.53), and at 52-weeks, 0.44 (0.04, 0.84), but shows no absolute difference (i.e. CI.95 crosses ES=0) in effectiveness relative to E+R for effectiveness at altering FFM. Furthermore, E+R does not show any absolute difference (i.e. CI.95 crosses ES=0) relative to ET alone for effectiveness at altering FFM. In addition to changes in body composition, the effectiveness for altering BMI following exercise indicates that ET and E+R is more effective than RT at 24-36 weeks, whereas E+R appears more effective than either ET or RT at 16-23 weeks of continuous training, yet RT is more effective than ET at 52-weeks, 0.54 (0.09, 0.99), table 1.

Effectiveness related to changes in cytokines associated with health status
There appears to be little overall difference in the ES for altering cytokines associated with overfatness (e.g., leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, CRP, TNF- α) between the methods of exercise relative to the duration of training. Where each method of exercise indicates that a short-to-moderate duration of training, i.e. ≤23-weeks, is more effective relative to the longer durations of training. Within the ability to elicit changes in leptin or adiponectin, figure 2, RT appears to be more effective than ET and E+R at 16-23 weeks of training and E+R at ≤8-weeks of training for altering adiponectin, only. RT also appears to be more effective than ET, or E+R, for altering TNF-α levels at 9-15 weeks, supplemental figure 3. Moreover, RT was the only method of exercise to indicate differences between durations for altering leptin levels, where durations of ≤8-weeks was more effective than 16-23 weeks of training, 0.56 (0.04, 1.08). Unlike RT, ET and E+R indicated differences in effectiveness based on the duration of training for altering adiponectin, as each were more effective at 16- 23 weeks than at 9-15 weeks of training, 0.95 (0.62, 1.28) and 1.55 (1.01, 2.09) for ET and E+R respectively. Further E+R shows that a training duration of 16-23 weeks of training was more effective than any of the other training durations, 1.55 (1.03, 2.08) for altering adiponectin. Yet the duration of 9-15 weeks of training was the least effective relative to than any of the other training durations, -0.64 (-1.00, -0.16); especially when compared to the duration of ≤8-weeks of training, where the shortest duration is favored, 0.93 (0.37, 1.49). Additionally, no differences in effectiveness were seen in any of the methods of exercise (ET, RT, or E+R) to alter IL-6 based on the duration of training, supplemental figure 3. While on a limited basis for comparison, due to limited reports, RT at 9-15 weeks indicates being more effective than ≤8-weeks for altering CRP levels, 0.99 (0.12, 1.86), while ≤8-weeks is more effective than 16-23 weeks of training for altering TNF-α, 0.59 (0.06, 1.12), supplemental figure 3. Lastly, for exercise in general a training duration ≤8 weeks is more effective 24-36 weeks, 0.99 (0.37, 1.61), for altering TNF-α.

Effectiveness related to changes in markers of T2DM
Duration of training appears to have limited impact on the effectiveness for the specific type of exercise to elicit changes in the markers for T2DM, e.g. fasting levels of glucose and insulin, figures 3-4. That is except for E+R, where a training duration of 24-36 weeks is more effective than 9-15 weeks, 1.48 (0.36, 2.60) and at the duration of 9-15 weeks being more effective than the duration of 52-weeks, 0.59 (0.14, 1.04), for altering glucose and insulin concentrations respectively.

Even so, differences are noted between exercise based on the durations of training, table 1 and figures 3-4. As the use of RT and E+R are both more effective than ET at durations of 16-23 weeks of training for both altering glucose and insulin levels, table 1. While no other directional selection for effectiveness being noted between the RT and E+R for altering the levels of glucose of insulin, based on the duration of training. Yet E+R is more effective than RT at durations of 9-15 week training but less effective at 16-23 weeks, table 1.

Yet duration may have an impact on the effectiveness to elicit changes in A1c levels, figures 3-4. It appears that longer duration (52-week) of training is less effective than any other time frame, -0.71 (-1.04, -0.38), especially in comparison to training durations of ≤8-weeks, -0.48 (-0.93, -0.02), 9-15 week, -0.67 (-1.15, -0.18), 16-23 weeks, -0.77 (-1.24, -0.38) and the 24-36 weeks, -0.68 (-1.16, -0.20), with moderate durations of 9-15 weeks and 24-36 weeks being the most effective. Based on the method of exercise both ET and E+R indicate having a lower level of effectiveness at 52-weeks of training relative to all other shorter duration training, -0.51 (-0.77, -0.25) and -0.64 (-0.99, -0.29) respectively. Additionally, E+R is more effective than ET at moderate duration (16-23 week) of training, table 1. Whereas, RT at ≤8-weeks and 9-15 weeks are more effective than any of the longer duration studies, 0.46 (0.07, 0.86) and 0.74 (0.33, 1.15) respectively, with a duration ≤8-weeks being more effective than 16-23 weeks, or 52-weeks of training, 1.13 (0.60, 1.66) or 0.90 (0.01, 1.89) respectively, yet 16-23 weeks is less effective than the 52-weeks of training, -0.62 (-1.21, -0.03). Just as RT, E+R indicates that short and moderate durations are more effective than the 52-week duration of training, 0.46 (0.01, 0.99), 0.82 (0.33, 1.31) and 1.13 (0.47, 1.99), for ≤8-weeks, 9-15 weeks and 16-23 weeks respectively and ET indicates being more effective at ≤8-weeks and 9-15 weeks than 52-weeks of training, 0.67 (0.12, 1.12) and 0.52 (0.03, 1.01).

Effectiveness related to ability to alter measures of cardiorespiratory fitness
There were limited differences in effectiveness related to the changes in cardiovascular measures both between and within the methods of exercise based on the duration, table 1 and supplemental figure 4. Yet, the maximal effectiveness occurs between 8 and 16 weeks of continuous training followed by a plateau in the ES for both ET and RT. In regard to E+R it appears that shorter duration (≤ 8-weeks) training is more effective than moderate to long duration 9-15 weeks, 2.09 (1.08, 3.10) and 1.2 (0.98, 1.92), 16-23 weeks, 1.33 (0.60,1.93) and 1.17 (0.32, 1.90), or 52-weeks, 1.63 (0.48, 2.78) and 0.76 (0.41, 1.11), of training for eliciting changes in SBP and DBP respectively. Furthermore, for SBP, E+R indicated 52-weeks of training being less effective than all other shorter durations, -0.54 (-1.04, -0.06) while training for 9-15 and 16-23 weeks was more effective than any longer duration, 0.55 (0.24, 0.86) and 1.13 (0.82, 1.44) respectively. For ET, where a training duration of 16-23 weeks is the least effective, -0.64 (-1.03, -0.13), relative to all other durations with ≤8-weeks showing the greatest effectiveness relative to the measures at 16-23 weeks of training, 0.50 (0.01, 0.99). For the use of RT the greatest effectiveness occurs at durations of 24-36 weeks of training, 1.13 (0.65, 1.62) versus all other durations while 9-15 weeks is more effective relative to any of the longer durations, 0.55 (0.08,1.02), and specifically to 52-weeks of training, 0.77 (0.06, 1.53).

This pattern was also seen with effectiveness for altering DBP, supplemental figure 4. Where, comparisons within ET responses based on duration show a greater effectiveness at ≤8-weeks of training relative to any other longer training durations, 0.77 (0.43, 1.10), specifically being more effective versus training durations of 9-15 weeks, 1.02 (0.42, 1.86), 16-23 weeks, 1.17 (0.55, 1.92), and 52-weeks, 0.97 (0.15, 1.62). While E+R was less effective at the 9-15 week of training, 1.03 (0.53, 1.53), than any other duration and specifically less effective than the 52-weeks of training, 1.57 (0.85, 2.12). And RT showed greatest effectiveness at the 24-36 week training versus all other durations, 0.52 (0.05, 0.98) and was more effective at ≤8-weeks versus 52-weeks, 0.50 (0.03, 0.97), of training.

Aerobic fitness (VO2max) shows a continuous increase in ES throughout the duration of exercise, figure 5, yet effectiveness appears to be variable based on the duration of exercise, or the type of exercise program utilized, table 1 and figure 8. Exercise in general, only indicates an overall ES favoring for altering VO2max with duration of ≤8-weeks or 52-weeks of exercise intervention, 0.42 (0.00, 0.79) and 0.93 (0.50, 1.33) respectively, within the continuum shorter duration (≤8-weeks) exhibited a greater effectiveness relative to any longer duration, 1.00 (0.44, 1.56), and specifically versus 52-weeks, 1.23 (0.07, 2.30), or 9-15 weeks, 0.91 (0.18, 1.63), of training. As far as within exercise choices, ET is the only exercise that indicates a progressive increase in ES for eliciting changes inVO2max, figure 8, yet no clear evidence for greater ES based on a specific duration of training. While for RT ≤8-weeks of training was more effective than any of the longer duration training, 0.69 (0.29, 1.09), and specifically more effective than 52-weeks, 1.23 (0.80,1.66), or 9-15 weeks, 0.63 (0.15, 1.11) of training and for E+R 52-weeks of training was more effective than either 9-15 weeks, 0.75 (0.36, 1.14), or 16-23 weeks, 0.72 (0.17, 1.27). Comparison between exercise methods show that RT is also more effective than both ET and E+R at duration of ≤8-weeks, table 1 and figure 8, that reverses to the point of indicating no difference in effective as the training duration progresses into longer program designs, table 1.

DISCUSSION
Given the acceptance and recommendation that exercise, or an increase in the level of physical activity (with or without dietary modificaiton), [1, 8–10, 12, 24] while often ignoring the implication that not all exercise or physical activity are equal to each other, can produce positive benefits for any individual who is overfat; it behooves us to assess the impact that acute program variables (e.g., training method and duration) have on the effectiveness in eliciting these reported positive benefits. In particular, it becomes necessary to ascertain the impact and effect (e.g., therapeutic, the alteration of physiological functions, or cheerleader, the small physiological changes and psychological rewards that increase adherence and lead obtaining therapeutic effects) being imparted by exercise within physiological and pathophysiological functions leading to the change in health status of the individual who is overfat. As such, analysis here is a continuation of previous reports on the topic [23] which shows exercise imparts both cheerleader and therapeutic effects, coupling together to allow adaptations in the short duration to encourage the progressive improvement that only occurs from prolonged exposure to exercise ultimately generating the improvements in overall health status expected from exercise.

Within these effects, a continuum of effectiveness for eliciting beneficial responses from exercise develops from both the method and duration of exercise training. Where a lower limit for an effectiveness being completely beneficial, i.e. CI.95 for ES>0, occurs at 8-weeks of training and an upper limit for continual gain in effect (where a plateau of ES) at 32-weeks of training exist for any type of exercise exposure. Thus indicating that the duration of the exposure to stimulus from exercise is a factor for inducing changes not only in morphology, but also in the overall health status of the individual who is overfat. With the implication for a delay in the onset of effectiveness for inducing modifications from exercise that will also reach a point where no further benefit is achievable. Something to take into account not only when developing the short-term and long-term goals for exercise, but also in establishing the timing for when to modify the training stimulus within a continuous training regimen.

Furthermore, the implications for the timing of initial differences in effectiveness may help shed some light on why previous reports have indicated no difference between exercise methods in treating health issued for individuals who are overfat [24, 42, 114, 115]. As the delay in a distinct type of exercise exhibiting greater effectiveness versus other methods of exercise does not become evident until at least 8-weeks of continuous training is within the time frame that these reports are indicating for study durations. Thus the implication that any exercise has equal benefit is partially corrupted, as training durations being compared could simply be too short to have differences seen, rather than an implication and recommendation that equality between methods of exercise truly exists. Additionally, the continuum of responsiveness here indicates differences in effectiveness for the eliciting changes in various measures of interest are both duration and exercise dependent. Supporting the idea of a continuum of effectiveness noted previously for exercise (with and without diet modification) due to the level of muscle stimulation, without regard to duration [23]. And provides support to the idea of variability within responses that are due to the complex interactions between a multitude of factors, where exercise is one of a number of regulatory factors, in developing and resolving the diseased health status affecting the individual who is overfat [2, 8, 14].

As we parse through this continuum a distinct, and slightly perplexing, trend arises in relation to the difference in effectiveness previously noted as well as to the readily recommended methods of exercise, e.g., endurance (aerobic) or lower-intensity training, for the individual who is overfat to utilize [3, 6, 11, 23, 116–118]. Where after 8-weeks of continuous training, RT exhibits a greater effectiveness than ET across all measures of interest, with the exception of SBP and VO2max, and indicates limited differences to the responses elicited from E+R, with the exception of RT being more effective for altering positive changes in fat-free mass within overall body composition. Interestingly, given the dominance of recommendation, ET appears to have an effectiveness that favors not preforming that type of exercise as the duration of training progresses past 16-weeks of training for altering insulin concentrations. A finding that hints to difference in the metabolic stimulus between RT versus ET, or E+R, leading to the difference in responses and deserves much more attention [2, 14].

This conflict with the readily recommended method of exercise, i.e. reliance on ET [11, 117, 119], for individuals who are overfat, or susceptible to metabolic issues, may begin to help to explain why there is such low attrition for programs previously recommended and prescribed [13, 14]. As the effectiveness to alter outcome measures are not matching the implied desires for responses, or the goals developed, for the individual based on the recommendations for using exercise, i.e. ET, that does not provide the sufficient level of stimulus to effectively induce the desired outcome [2, 14, 23, 26, 120, 121]. However, the underlying physiological rationale for the implication of the total training stimulus intensity has on the responses to exercise from individuals who are overfat is incomplete, and deserves much more research. In particular, understanding of how the training stimulus provided from RT instills differences in effectiveness, beyond a moderate duration of training not provided from either ET or E+R [23, 115, 118]. Which is especially important given that we need to have a prolonged engagement with exercise to instill constant improvements in health status of the individual who is overfat.

Although there are trends in conflict with previous reports, some trends support the connotation to the previously touted choice for ET as the selected method of exercise [7, 11, 26, 117–122]. Specifically related to its effectiveness for altering aerobic fitness (VO2max), a finding that might be due to the ET induced alterations in adipose metabolism and the subsequent changes in hormonal and metabolite signals [59, 119, 122–124]. Moreover, while ET indicates being more effective than RT, it shows a high degree of similarity in effectiveness relative to E+R. With the differences between all of the training methods only seen early in training that wane as the duration of training progresses in length. Therefore, indicating that the alteration in acute metabolic responses to the exposure of ET do not occur until later in the duration of training from the inclusion of RT within the exercise training regimen [59, 119, 122–124]. The indication of difference also supports a contention [26] that E+R maybe more effective than either RT or ET alone, as E+R could possibly provide a combination of the stimulus that may induce acute changes similar to ET that do not exist for RT until the exercise duration becomes prolonged. In which E+R may be inducing a metabolic stress that are in fact different from RT or ET, based on the intensity and duration of exercise, an issue that deserves more attention in future research, yet additional speculation falls outside the scope of this analysis.

Nonetheless, the differences indicated here are most likely the results of linking modifications in metabolic state and cardiovascular fitness to the ability to effectively alter inflammatory biomarkers associated with overfatness. As modifications develop through the combination of these cytokines coupled with the difference in the metabolic and mechanical stimulus provided by exercise impacts the overall level of response [8, 23, 112, 125, 126]. Where the trend for effectiveness continues to show agreement with a previous discussion related to the importance of inclusion of RT, while also showing disagreement with recent reviews touting the use of E+R versus either ET or RT [23, 26, 42, 115, 125, 126]. In addition to this agreement, the comparison between the types of exercise show that both RT and E+R are more effective than ET, yet show no difference between each other at the various durations examined. An implication which would mean while seeing differential cardiorespiratory responses absolutely is due to the overall duration of training, the level of effectiveness to elicit the response supports the indication for the importance of the stimulus of training [23]. Yet, just as with the indication of differences in altering aerobic fitness and metabolism the interactions are an issue that needs further investigation.

Notwithstanding the number of questions remaining unanswered regarding the underlying physiological differences between methods of exercise, indications from the findings here allow extrapolation to the designing and developing of exercise programs. Most important is an indication of effectiveness waning as training becomes prolonged, especially when compared to shorter and moderate duration training regimens. Thus, indicating that the differences in absolute values that may support the use of longer duration training programs may simply be the indication of total time being a factor in establishing absolute differences, not for the overall effectiveness. Which is interesting given the desire that exercise becomes a continued pattern of behavior throughout life for improved health [5, 8]. However, if you were to couple the impact that shorter duration training has to overall effectiveness, i.e. utilize intermittent and varying intensities of training through a periodization of the exercise program, with the prolonged use of exercise we may be able to maximize the overall impact that exercise can have within a treatment regimen.

From the perspective of coupling the shorter duration effectiveness over the long duration use of exercise, a series of recommendations are available to establish a periodization of exercise in the treatment of health issues for the individual who is overfat. First, given the peak time for greatest effectiveness, training programs may be best when designed around a blocked-periodized schedule of 4-to-12-week durations, using a schedule of 3 days of RT and 3-4 days ET per 7-day training week. Second, when developing exercise prescriptions RT is highly recommended for use as the principal form of exercise utilized intermittently in shorter durations, e.g., 4 to 8 weeks, or through a concurrent pattern of exercise with ET in both shorter and moderate duration regimens. With the training intensity of RT being most effective when utilizing a level of exercise stimulus associated with muscle hypertrophy (e.g., >75% 1RM at a training volume of 3-sets of 10-repetitions with 60-seconds of rest) [23]. While ET should be rarely implemented alone, and when utilized should be incorporated into a training regimen through a combination of concurrent training with RT for short to moderate durations of training, i.e. 8-to-12 weeks, at the previously indicated [23] levels for greatest effectiveness (e.g., intervals of variable intensities for 30-40 minutes, or continuously at a heart rate intensity >75% HRmax (VO2max) for 40-60 minutes). Yet more investigation into the patterning and programming of periodized exercise for individuals who are overfat is necessary before these recommendations can become definitive, especially related to the impact of the method (e.g., linear, blocked, or undulating) for periodization on physiological responses seen within the mesocycle and the macrocycle development of the periodized training regimen.

Furthermore, understanding the pattern of effectiveness based on the duration of training also allows for the establishment of properly organized and segmented goals, e.g., short-term, moderate-term, and long-term goals. Which is ever important, as there is the given need to have a psychological attraction to, and reward for completing, the individual exercise session that eventually allows for long-term positive adaptations in health status to develop for the individual who is overfat. While it may be true that body compositional changes are a key cheerleader effect to continuation of exercise for individuals who are overfat reliance on body composition early can be a hindrance to comply with using exercise. This may be due to the apparent delay in the onset of effectiveness, at least 8-weeks before CI.95 of ES is always >0.00, and the over-reliance on such modifications, in the short-term, where the inability to meet unrealistic goals may be detrimental to the psychological adherence necessary for continual application of exercise. Thereby, short-term (<8-weeks) goals reflect behavior changes, i.e. finding a “workout partner” or “getting into the gym”, and performance gains, i.e. increase in strength or endurance measures for a given exercise or pattern of activity, more than improvements in either body composition or health status. As these changes in behavior and performance will act as the cheerleader effects necessary early in any behavior intervention that leads to the continuation in the intervention, e.g., exercise, when self-selection for continuation is required. Stemming from these performance goals should be moderate-term (8-12 week) and long-term (i.e. >12-week) goals related to modifications in outcome measures, e.g., changes in body composition, diabetic indices, aerobic fitness, that should be reachable within a beneficial therapeutic effect (i.e. favoring use of treatment). Additionally, intermediate goals should be a reflection of a combination of performance, body compositional and health status modifications that are necessary to ensure the continual use of exercise throughout the lifetime of the individual.

Even with these implications and indications, the ability to formally aver these statements is limited. Namely, the formalization of these implications is limited by the current state of publication bias toward reporting only positive findings along with any study published after the end of inclusion and beginning of analysis. Secondly, limitations to the over-arching similarity of exercise prescription utilized and responses from participants in the various studies included within the analysis here. Thirdly, while the general rule for meta-analysis and regression analysis is to examine random-controlled studies only, a methodological hindrance in blinding subjects to use of exercise studies for human participants exists and therefore studies analyzed here included observational, tracking and peer-grouped controlled studies along with the random-controlled studies. To combat these limitations, analysis was performed based on the assumption of random-effect in all calculations. However, even the use of the assumption for random-effect will not eliminate all limitations to this study and therefore, we must continue to review and analyze findings on a pooled-effect to further ascertain the level of effectiveness that different methods of exercise acts to elicit beneficial effect for individuals who are overfat. Additionally, the implications for training intensities and development of periodization of training for individuals who are overfat has gone completely unanswered, outside of this report and earlier from this author and leaves a large hole in the body of knowledge to fill if we wish to continue to stipulate the use of exercise in the medical treatment of overfatness.

CONCLUSIONS
Analysis of effectiveness based on the duration of exercise training indicates a continuum of effectiveness for both the type of exercise and the overall duration of training. In which exercise does not provide an overall level of beneficial effect (i.e. CI.95 of ES not including 0.00) until the completion of at least 8-weeks of continuous training. And where differences between types of exercise do not become evident until 8-weeks for changes in body morphology and 12-weeks for modifying measures of either cardiorespiratory or metabolic characteristics. As such, it needs to be stressed that for individuals who are overfat even with anecdotal reports for rapid results from the inclusion of exercise, the effectiveness of exercise for eliciting modifications in both body composition and health status may in fact be a delayed. From which it is possible to make distinct clinical recommendations. First, early goals must focus on behavioral changes and performance (e.g., starting the pattern of exercise, making improvements in the within session training intensities) modifications versus clinical (e.g., morphological, or cardiovascular and metabolic fitness) modifications early in treatment. While clinical modification becomes important for goal setting once training has become prolonged. Secondly, since the beneficial effectiveness of exercise wanes over time, where we see differences in effectiveness at very short durations that plateaus as durations become longer that parallels the reduction in the difference of effectiveness between the methods of exercise as the duration of the training reaches prolonged duration periods of continuous training. Specifically, the waning of effectiveness indicates that 32-weeks of continuous training may be a point where adaptations of benefit have been optimally reached. As such, long-term exercise regimens must be periodized so as to maximize the short-term benefits while minimizing the impact that the 32-week plateau has on continued effectiveness and responses to exercise.

When parsed into the distinct methods of exercise, there is an indication of differences between the methods of exercise within these continuums of effectiveness based on duration. In which RT, or E+R, is more effective for eliciting beneficial alterations to measures of body composition (e.g., FM and FFM), DBP, markers of inflammation and T2DM than ET across the various timeframes. With the greatest difference between methods of exercise seen at shorter and moderate duration lengths of training (8-to-24 weeks in duration). While ET is more effective at altering SBP and VO2 than RT or E+R and equally effective for altering BM, only seen at longer duration lengths of training (>24-weeks in duration). Furthermore, even though recently touted for greater effectiveness, E+R appears to have little difference in overall effectiveness related to the changing the measures of interest in comparison to that of either RT or ET based on the duration of training.
