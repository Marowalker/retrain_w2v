Usage and distribution for commercial purposes requires written permission.The increasing understanding of the genome is recognised as being one of the main determinants of future improvement in healthcare. The availability of genetic data from a large number of individuals increases the ability to investigate questions across many rare and common diseases and in different populations, and also provides more information for understanding clinical care outcomes for an individual. A number of large scale genome sequencing initiatives have been launched in the last few years to try and capitalise on this potential. Within Europe, the UK has led the way with the 100,000 Genomes Project. This project looks at the genome sequences of patients with rare diseases or cancer. More recently France announced plans to invest EUR 670 million in a genomics and personalised medicine programme. In the US, the Precision Medicine Initiative aims at large-scale research by gathering one million or more volunteers to extend precision medicine to all diseases. Meanwhile, China has announced plans to invest nearly USD 10 billion in its own precision medicine initiative. These projects demonstrate the commitment at a national level and raise the question “What benefits would be realised by undertaking a million genome initiative in a coordinated effort across European countries?” A coordinated, pan-European MEGA project would garner crucial genetic information that could have an immeasurable benefit when it comes to the health of current and future EU citizens.

Maximising Genomics
Seeking the key to concrete action to channel Europe's wealth of expertise in genomics is long overdue. Europe not only has formidable potential, but has already yielded world-beating insights in the short history of the science.

But the expertise is widely scattered, Europe's actions in the field are frequently uncoordinated and even disjointed. And the infrastructure necessary for full development of the potential is conspicuously patchy. For all the brilliance of its researchers, the enterprise of its companies, and the foresight of its authorities, perceptions and understanding of this treasure-house of opportunity vary widely, and Europe displays only the most tenuous shared purpose as to how to maximise its undoubted strengths in contributing to the health of Europeans and of their health systems [1].

Genomics is increasingly ready to be used to improve health and it can provide a treasure-house of opportunity. It is now beginning to move on from specialist areas such as diagnosis of rare diseases and the selection of appropriate cancer therapies, towards the fuller integration of genomics across healthcare systems that will permit wide use of personalised medicine to improve health care and reduce costs [2].

Improved Health Outcomes
Genomics has transformed diagnosis, treatment and management of Bardet-Biedl syndrome, a rare ciliopathic human genetic disorder leading to renal disease, obesity and diabetes. Until recently, its rarity meant a long journey to diagnosis and fragmented and costly care. But UK health service collaboration with patient supporters and research groups created a next-generation genetic testing service that has proved so successful the model is being replicated across the spectrum of ciliopathies.

Whole genome sequencing has allowed clinicians to rapidly identify Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome, a rare degenerative disorder that leads to progressive sensorineural deafness. Diagnosis is difficult - misdiagnosis can often lead to multiple ineffective treatments and unnecessary surgery without delivering patient benefit. But now it is possible to treat the disease simply - and cheaply - with vitamin B2.

Genomics is allowing clinicians to prevent - or identify and treat - serious adverse drug reactions to medicines such a warfarin and carbamazepine. Ensuring that the right drugs are targeted to the right patients is eliminating unintended patient harm and life-threatening emergency medical admissions.

Using genomics, clinicians are now able to far more accurately assess each individual's personal risk of breast cancer, reducing the need for regular imaging and sometimes invasive procedures that deliver imperfect results. This allows a move away from a reactive approach to long-term management plans that combine targeted screening and non-invasive options such as tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer developing.

Genomics is aiding understanding of genetic change in tumours, and new, highly personalised and effective medications are now being used that target the genetically different subtypes of lung cancer.

Prostate cancer researchers are discovering genetic hallmarks that allow them to use olaparib - a drug originally developed for ovarian cancer treatment - to treat patients who have ceased to respond to more traditional prostate cancer approaches.

Research into Stage II (Dukes) colon cancer has developed a genetic blood test that allows clinicians to identify high-risk patients who are likely to experience recurrence after surgery and will benefit from chemotherapy.

Genomics has revealed that colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease and that traditional one-size-fits-all approaches are ineffective. Now it is identifying patients who will benefit from novel treatments - sparing many the trauma of chemotherapy [3].

Cytotoxic therapy - costly and ineffective in 80 percent of patients - is being transformed by genomics, which can predict and measure responses before treatment by using genetic biomarkers, sparing non-responsive patients.

Sequencing can help diagnosis by identifying relevant mutations causing disease, so reducing the use of interventions in patients who will gain little or no benefit, and consequently realising significant savings [4].

A More Efficient Europe
With so much opportunity, but with so much current dispersal of Europe's steps to take advantage of it, there is an obvious need to bring the many strands closer together. It does not help to advance genomics in Europe that there is so little interconnection between those who should be partners.

Europe needs agreement on standards for genomic data generation, analysis, privacy and sharing of genomic and associated clinical and other phenotype data, including self-reported data, data from wearables, omics, and imaging. It needs more effective clinical informatics, with agreed standards for interoperability of health informatics systems. Coordinated na- tional activity would ensure best practice emerging on clinical implementation. There are gaps that need filling with a European strategy on engaging the public in discussions around genomics and data use, and with a European training programme in genomics, informatics and personalised medicine for clinical staff. And discussion is needed with and among European regulators on the appropriate mechanisms for regulating clinical genomic testing [5].

Filling the Gaps
The Million European Genomes Alliance (MEGA) is intended to remedy these deficiencies. It aims to allow the wide scope of genomics to be realised - and to ensure that these findings can also feed effectively to reinforce the emergence of personalised medicine. The rationale for MEGA is that there are massive gains within easy reach for science, research, medicine, healthcare resources, and patient outcomes. But these gains are still to be grasped.

MEGA will provide the mechanisms to derive fuller benefits sooner from all this potential. It will make it possible to combine forces across disparate and separate activities, to accumulate and exploit research findings, to ensure that Europe's infrastructure meets the needs - and, as its name suggests, it will provide information on the genetic, molecular, clinical and social characteristics of a million participating European citizens.

Crucially, it will bring focus to European activity in this field, building links across Europe. It will bring together the key partners in genomics and personalised medicine in the public sector, academia, industry, policy makers and civil society. The aim is for it to be up and running by 2020, and delivering benefits to Europe through the next decade of discovery as genomics and personalised medicine come of age.

Why would MEGA be superior to the many existing initiatives? On the conceptual level, a united project will make it possible to ask questions that smaller studies could not answer, such as multi-gene interactions. In terms of economics and organisation, a larger scale and sharing of data allow better use of resources and deeper analysis. The impact will be to provide results of a pan-European project that can produce benefits for patients faster; the MEGA infrastructure will also be useful to disseminate results in a more coordinated way, easing access for end users.

At the technology level, it could respond to the widening perception that genomics, while extremely useful, is limited in providing functional information. For instance, the correlation of genomics with drug responses overall is rather poor apart from some exceptions. Genomics can predict a risk, but not when the risk will hit, or how a disease will progress and change during therapy. For these dynamic features dynamic parameters need to be measured, such as metabolites and proteins.

Shared Efforts
Across Europe, as across the developed world, there is a hunger to penetrate the science of genomics, to harvest the understanding it can offer at the most esoteric level of human biology, of health and disease, and of individuals' predispositions and characteristics. The European Union and its member states are backing these efforts with research funding, and by sponsoring or promoting or hosting initiatives ranging from biobanks to disease-related groups and research consortia. Professional and scientific societies are driving investigations. And the healthcare industry is investing massively in everything from basic research to candidate personalised medicine products and companion diagnostics based on the evolving science [6]. The overall goals of all this activity overlap, more or less, but with significant divergences and frequent inconsistencies. MEGA will make it possible for multiple efforts to become shared efforts, with consequently improved chances of success, both in science, and in application of the science in improved healthcare. It will institute a central coordinating body to link across regions, member states, and European bodies and infrastructure.

Shared Focus
Clinical and research use of genomic technologies has until now largely concentrated on the one percent of the genome that are the instructions for cells to make proteins, the genes [7]. MEGA will look to provide maximal gain by concentrating on whole genome sequencing. It will concentrate on access to high-quality data to increase the power of genomic testing in current clinical indications and establish the foundations for future application of genomic medicine. The disease areas incorporated will respond to requests from the clinical, patient and life science community, assessed by a central expert advisory body. The focus is likely to encompass rare diseases (patient and relevant family members), cancer (with patient samples from blood and tumour), and a number of complex diseases (covering both physical and mental health). There will also be scope for incorporating “healthy” participants although the focus here will be on studies to understand role in disease prevention and risk assessment.

Shared Benefits
Genomics has been a game-changer for clinical and translational research over the past decade, and has improved success in drug discovery and development. Major genomics programmes are also recognised as having stimulated significant economic return. The economic impact of the Human Genome Project in the USA has been calculated as USD 796 billion. With a direct personalised medicine market that is predicted to grow to over EUR 150 billion in 2024 there are rewards available for leaders in this sector [8].

There are currently limitations and inefficiencies in national programmes aiming to secure these health and commercial benefits. A collaborative supra-national initiative such as MEGA can offer an answer, and help position Europe as the global leader in personalised medicine and genomics. MEGA can provide benefits to European countries of whatever size, because even the biggest member states are unable to conduct all the aspects of this burgeoning discipline on their own.

However, across European countries taken together there is the critical mass and all the components needed to realise this vision. MEGA will bring together bodies, infrastructure and people with similar purpose but fragmented activity. It will leverage investments already made, particularly in sequencing, biobanking and data infrastructure, but also in the equally necessary realms research, health, and education systems.

Bringing together world-leading practice and expertise that exists in pockets across countries and sectors will make it possible to apply their collective knowledge and skills to address universal health challenges, and provide a network for sharing best practice [9]. The scope of MEGA will also provide sufficient scale to inform the significance of “signals” identified in genomic and associated data and make new clinically impactful associations, as well as to support cost rationalisation.

There will be benefits too for Europe's ambitions to provide its citizens with safe, cost-effective, sustainable health systems with equality of access. It will support initiatives on eHealth and cross-border healthcare. And it will help in developing high-value jobs and giving the healthcare industry additional vigour as part of a digital economy.

MEGA would be a realisation of the aims expressed in Article 35 of the Luxembourg EU Presidency's Council Conclusions on personalised medicine to “encourage dialogue with Member States' authorities and stakeholders to facilitate step-by-step implementation of the public health genomics approach both at European Union and national level… and facilitate ongoing initiatives” [10].

Shared Assets
Europe has attributes that give it the chance of being highly competitive in a world fighting for leadership in this promising sector. It is the home to a large and heterogenous population that also contains diverse ethnic populations and some genetic isolate populations. It boasts cohesive and predominantly social health systems, working to a high standard with the same values in comparable structures and under similar pressures, adhering to similar legislation and other influences. Its scientific and technology capabilities in genomics and in many broader fields are globally respected and envied. Public funding support is available for health research, and major national and multinational programmes have demonstrably delivered successful results. And there is some health data infrastructure [11]. With adequate investment and political will, the chances are good for successful cross-border collaboration, for enhancement of the data infrastructure, and even for that most elusive element of Europe's skill-set - translating its knowledge capital into innovation and into successful commercialisation.

Shared Opportunities
Even with Europe's advantageous background, to seize the opportunities of personalised medicine requires in-depth expertise across clinical, genomic, health informatic, bioinformatic, and social engagement and implementation fields. Many of the skills and experience needed are rare in individual nations, and difficult to harness. But the skills do exist taking Europe as a whole rather than as a collection of separate countries [12]. This is where MEGA will play a crucial role, bringing these skills together so as to further the plans of individual nations through deploying the sum of expertise derived from wide participation.

MEGA will provide a common vision and purpose, so that existing resources are best used, and related initiatives at member state and European level can be accelerated. It will develop a federated “knowledgebase” of genomic and health information, and surround this with platforms and networks for clinical discussion and training, collaborative research and innovation and enterprise. It will set up a cross-border network of expertise, and create a platform for participant engagement to educate and involve citizens and patients in the use of their genomic and health data. And it will support the development of necessary infrastructure.

Genomic Medicine Initiatives
A catalogue of global genomic data initiatives (Table 1) is compiled by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). This demonstrates the great breadth and purpose of major initiatives, with many established for research purposes but a number with the intention of directly supporting clinical care or to generate data for commercial uses, most commonly for drug discovery.

Shared Infrastructure
Infrastructure is as vital as expertise to the successful exploitation of genomics and the development of personalised medicine - and in Europe it is just as scattered. Infrastructure encompasses a broad range of needs: health and research systems able to process samples and collect and transfer data; centralised biobanks that can efficiently manage and store samples; sequencers capable of performing whole genome sequencing at scale and supercomputers capable of processing large volumes of genetic information; and a skilled workforce and engaged population [13]. Some of this infrastructure is already in place in the member states (Table 2). MEGA will support further investment to ensure all participating countries can meet needs of shared development of personalised medicine, and bring experts in required areas from across countries to share knowledge and agree best practice.

Shared Engagement in Europe
Beyond specific initiatives and infrastructure directly related to genomics, MEGA will also support wider priorities at a European and member state level, in eHealth, cross-border clinical care, and networks of expertise such as the rare disease reference networks. It will also provide a platform to generate implementation evidence and to consider the wider implications of genomic and health data. Using MEGA as a real use case will help shape the implementation of recent major revisions of EU legislation, such as rules on data protection or in vitro diagnostics, and will support efforts at harmonisation of legal and ethical frameworks across European countries [14].

Shared Responsibilities
Advances in knowledge and technology, exemplified by the improvements in genomic sequencing, enable the shift to a personalised, predictive, preventive, and participatory health system. A system that can provide the right information and treatment to the right people at the right time.

But the rapid advances in technology have the potential to present a further challenge to sustainability of health systems. If they are applied in an indiscriminate and uncoordinated manner their results could destabilise the already fragile framework of national health budgets. Avalanches of expensive new products, perhaps insufficiently validated, or duplicating one another's effects, could raise the pressure on the strained finances of national authorities. However, with planned development and appropriate regulatory systems, personalised medicine holds out the prospect of more sustainable, efficient and effective health systems. Much depends on the quality of the arrangements for the development and funding of personalised medicine [15].

A Shared Shift in Healthcare
The proper use of personalised medicine implies a shift to a predictive, preventive, and participatory healthcare system that puts the citizen at the centre. By providing the right information and treatment to the right people at the right time, personalised medicine permits a move beyond merely reactive disease-centred systems, and opens the pathway to an approach planned and concentrated on prevention and health. The move away from a “one size fits all” approach is facilitated by using new technologies, and notably genome sequencing, to understand the fundamental biological basis of health and disease. By combining this information with a person's clinical information, circumstances, and values, personalised medicine allows doctors, patients, and citizens to develop and implement targeted prevention and treatment [16].

Shared Mechanics
At the heart of MEGA will be information on the genetic, molecular, clinical and social characteristics of a million participating European citizens. Genomic data produced by participating organisations will be stored in the database, and the linking of health data with genomic data will be made possible along with access to repositories of publicly available data. Working across country borders to link and develop the infrastructure to form a genome-phenome knowledgebase of scale will help address the understanding of genetic change in an individual setting by providing validated information on others with the same genetic change, as well linking to the appropriate clinician or relevant researcher [17].

Maximising the value of a knowledge-base of genomic information requires tools to support access and understanding, and interaction across different groups. So supporting platforms and networks will provide clinical application, through interpretation and reporting tools and integration into health records, health professional interaction, and access as a training resource. MEGA will also support collaborative multidisciplinary research, and commercial enterprise through the development of new analytical tools, integrating innovative technologies and providing a drug target discovery and trials interface.

MEGA will also support an evolving workforce to access information to guide cost-effective management at the point of care, by establishing appropriate quality standards for data, and providing an ecosystem to ensure the right information is provided to health professionals in the most intelligible format. It will also work alongside national eHealth programmes and clinical guidelines to ensure the right information is integrated into electronic health records of participants. New clinical decision support tools will help make information become part of daily practice. Clinical discussion networks across participating sites will aid interpretation and wide application of genomics, and collaborating with national and regional education programmes will make genomic and clinical data available for recognised training.

Although a number of European and national initiatives have improved large-scale collaborative working there are still barriers to multidisciplinary collaborative health research and much activity is within “siloes” of activity. MEGA will form research area groups to work together to answer clinically and socially pertinent questions.

Innovative approaches across sectors and disciplines will be pioneered to develop more effective medicines and diagnostic tests, as well as new models in health technology, data analytics and informatics that address key clinical and scientific challenges.

Sharing Partners
The likely partners include relevant European Commission directorates-general, such as Health and Food Safety, Research and Innovation, Digital Economy, and Enterprise and Industry. They will also feature initiatives such as ELIXIR, the European Bioinformatics Institute, the Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure, the European Open Science Cloud, and the international consortium on personalised medicine, ICPerMed. Member state ministries covering health, research, science, and business, regional health organisations, major healthcare providers or payers, and health data bodies are other obvious potential partners. Patient and support organisations such as the European Cancer Patient Coalition, European Patient Forum, European Organisation for Rare Diseases, Inspire2Live, International Diabetes Federation, European Brain Council would also find their place in MEGA. So too would academic, research and funding bodies such as the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Science Europe, European Association for Cancer Research, or clinical and scientific professional societies such as the European Societies of Human Genetics, Medical Oncology, Cardiology, and Pharmacogenomics and Personalised Therapy, European Respiratory Society, or the European Centre for Public Health Genomics. Industry bodies such as the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations or MedTech Europe would bring important perspectives, as would key companies in the field, such as Illumina, Roche Diagnostics, BC Platforms, or Sophia Genetics in genomic sequencing and analysis, Intel and SAP in IT infrastructure, and pharmaceutical firms heavily involved in personalised medicine such as AstraZeneca, or Roche.

The European Alliance for Personalised Medicine either incorporates or is linked in to all of these stakeholders and provides a platform to manage and coordinate stakeholders from an already advanced and educated position.

A Shared Future
Some of these technological and scientific advances are already being implemented in healthcare, and more are coming closer to turning opportunity into reality. Change is inevitable. The question that Europe faces now is not whether to pursue the development of personalised medicine, but how to support health systems so they can integrate personalised medicine into the efficient and effective transformation that it offers. MEGA puts participating Member States on an accelerated and realisable path to achieve this.

This might include a phased approach to areas of focus - such as tackling low hanging fruits, such as cancer and rare disease, in years 1–3; then midterm (years 3–6) diabetes and cardiovascular; and long term (years 6–10) neurodegeneration, immune response disorders, inflammation, arthritis.

The intention is to secure support for the proposal in 2017, so that core leadership and a project team can be set up to lead gap analysis in 2018 while winning broad stakeholder engagement. In 2019 pilot work should start, and core infrastructure and processes should be developed. In that way, MEGA can deliver benefit as from 2020.
