These would encourage cross-disciplinary and cross-border collaboration in research and development using an “open innovation” approach. The goal would be to create and stimulate interface structures between academia-clinicians-industry in order to expedite research-based and patient-centred discoveries. This would improve tailored medicines and speed up patient access. Such a scenario would also allow for new levels of trust between the research community and participants and patients, the elimination of silos of single-use data and removal of country-specific gridlocks plus equal treatment of all health research data, including genetic information. Europe needs to encourage a systematic early dialogue between innovators, patients and decision-makers throughout all regulatory steps to provide guidance and clarity so as to avoid a disruptive scenario. Silos, as the authors will show, can often be counter-productive and stifle the appetite for innovation.

Reaching agreement on challenging topics is always a struggle when people come to the discussion with sharply differing views - and maybe some prejudices. These are the sort of tensions that we have all seen rise to the surface from time to time and wreck a family wedding celebration or a dinner party that was looking so promising.

But at the same time, achieving new and constructive understanding across distinct and divergent attitudes can also be deeply satisfying when it works out.

If the traditional healthcare sector was throwing a dinner party and found that one guest had brought along new information technology as a partner, that surprise guest - let's call him Tex - might well generate some tensions.

Of course the customary duties of hospitality would prevail, but our healthcare host - would Hospi be too far-fetched a name? - might well be worried about not being able to offer the right sort of welcome. Perhaps insufficient resources, or the wrong environment, with risks of difficult interactions between Tex and some of the other more conservative guests.

Tex, with practiced charm, might offer reassurance to our host. “Don't worry, I've turned up at similar dinners over the years, with many other sectors who were initially equally hesitant - like aviation or communications or security. But they soon realised I had something very valuable to offer.”

Hospi is placated, if not entirely reassured, and Tex's contribution to the evening - in terms of some new ingredients and some new techniques - is grudgingly appreciated by the other guests. But at the end of the dinner, each guest goes back to his or her own ways, because, as is the case with our host, the attachment to traditional ways is very strong.

At the following weekend's dinner party, our host finds that the table talk is not without uncomfortable reminders of the same controversial intrusions. One of the usual guests - perhaps a nurse or an oncologist or radiologist - has been won over during the week by some of Tex's arguments and offerings, and urges everyone to overcome their reluctance to have any contact with Tex.

“His stuff was really quite helpful,” says the new convert. “You should drop him a letter and ask if he's got anything that would be useful to you.” But Hospi, feeling a sense of responsibility to healthcare as a whole, politely allows the topic to get only a brief airing, then firmly and rapidly (if equally politely) moves the conversation back to more familiar themes, to avoid too much attention being given to this troubling prospect of machines mastering men.

A week later the usual crowd of friends are gathered, and the dinner is proceeding with a comfortable absence of controversy as the guests swap stories of how good things were when they were all a bit younger. An unexpected and insistent knocking at the door signals the arrival of a tenuous acquaintance from the world of politics.

“I was in the area, and Tex told me that you often entertain at the weekend,” says Paul the politician, when Hospi opens the front door, letting in an unwelcome chill wind from the outside. “I was hoping you might let me join you this evening - I've got one or two ideas I'd like to talk about with your crowd. My country will be holding the presidency next year, and we've been in discussions with the preceding and following presidencies, and we have some longer-term thinking that could apply to your recipes. And from what Tex told me, it sounds like some of your dishes could be improved by a few new ideas - as might some of your usual guests, Tex suggested too!”

Distinctly unimpressed by this less-than-complimentary overture, our host demurs, offering the excuse that tonight's guests all know one another very well, and know their own fields very well, and are comfortable in one another's presence at these regular convivial gatherings without any risk of anyone treading on anyone else's toes.

In fact Hospi is too polite to disclose to Paul, even in the face of his gratuitous provocation, the real reason for declining access: Hospi sees too much of a risk of contamination from close contact with people like Paul. “They come from another world, and they don't understand how we've been making healthcare work for decades,” Hospi believes. You want to ensure that things are kept neat and clean, in the kitchen and at the table, even if that requires some deliberate maintenance of separation.

“And anyway, every time some smart strategist comes up with a new way of organising the kitchen, it disturbs the staff, and all these dieticians' rapidly changing recommendations upset our menu-planning, which means my guests have to get used to food prepared in ways they don't like,” our host thinks quietly and smugly, recalling the well-meaning efforts of a manager called COM who'd tried to bring some consistency to all this uncoordinated input, but without much success.

As Hospi closes the door behind the departing Paul, only faintly does he hear something that sounds like “You can't stay for ever in silos!” floating back from the street outside in accompaniment to retreating footsteps. “What has silos got to do with us?” our host reflects, rejoining his undisturbed fellow diners in the warmth.

The word “silos” crops up again, but in a different context, when Hospi is a guest at a dinner a week later, hosted by a friend from a big member state. Hospi wants to talk about recent difficulties encountered at the market when trying to get hold of some new ingredients with strong medicinal properties at a reasonable price. “Have you got any tips?” Hospi asks the host; “I see you're serving them up tonight. How much did you pay?” But Hospi's host doesn't want to talk about prices and access. The only answer Hospi gets is: “Look, Hospi, we're big, and we get a special price, but my supplier says I'm getting a good deal, and if I want to continue, then I have to keep the details to myself.”

Hospi presses the case a little further, suggesting that if more information was shared among everyone wanting those ingredients, everyone would be better off. Even sharing some of the information about how the ingredients can fit into a dish or a menu would be useful in deciding on a purchase, “and you must have quite a bit of data about that from your regular guests,” Hospi continues, waving a hand towards the distinguished company of scientists and industry bosses around his host's well-favoured table.

Faced with another rebuff - not too polite, either - from the host, Hospi drops the subject. But that's when the word “silos” floats across his mind, with a slightly discomfiting recollection of just a week before, on his own doorstep. He wonders to himself if it might be possible to get together a group of like-minded member states - even if it was not everyone - who would be ready to share more information about procuring ingredients, maybe even discussing together recipes and culinary adventures with new dishes…

There could be something, he reflects, to all this talk of healthier eating - although he is instantly aware that more information would be needed on the interaction of some of these new ingredients he's heard of, coming from different suppliers, such as CTR, DP, or IVD. In fact, he concludes, it might be better if all these novelties had been designed at the same time by the same supplier with the same objective - because that would have eliminated from the outset any risk of them not working well together.

So when Hospi is hosting another of his own dinner parties a few days later, back in his own comfortable territory, he takes the opportunity to raise with his guests the question of whether there might be something more to sharing data and to exploiting technology than he had hitherto thought appropriate in a healthcare context.

Could there be, he suggested diffidently, something to be said for breaking out of customary silos, for making wider use of data, for crossing the boundaries imposed by tradition, in search of a greater good, in which the interests of individual patients triumphed over the sectional and sectoral concerns of the healthcare establishment. Even, maybe, some form of incentives to encourage innovation…

His guests' reaction was unanimously hostile. “Don't be absurd,” they chorused - and one of them ventured: “Get a grip on yourself, Hospi… the next thing we know, you'll be talking about medicine that is ‘personalised’ to the needs of each individual! That is never going to be a realistic scenario!”

Bon appétit with this special edition.
