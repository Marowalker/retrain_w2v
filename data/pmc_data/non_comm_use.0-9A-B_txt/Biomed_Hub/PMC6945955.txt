It isn't just hype. After a slow start in much of Europe, the advent of digital technology really is transforming healthcare - and, more to the point, is going to transform it even further in the coming decade. Look at the miracle of computerised tomography, and the still greater miracle of how transmitting it over the Internet from radiology centres can put detailed patient information in front of a treating physician even in another hospital.

A great leap forward. But greater leaps are to come. Right now it takes about a quarter of an hour to download that CT image - but by 2025, faster networks could cut this to under a minute. And the download time for human genome sequencing - with the unparalleled knowledge about individual patients this has provided to medical research - could be slashed from the current 1 month to little more than a day.

No one knows better than Estonia the merits of putting the digital society at the service of health. Over the last 10 years it has revolutionised its healthcare system with e-solutions for the entire population, offering doctors, patients, hospitals, and the government new levels of convenience, access, and savings. Electronic health records, combining data from Estonia's 800 healthcare providers, create for each patient a birth-to-death medical history, and feed into the electronic health registry that gives doctors nationwide access to critical information, and compiles data for national health policy decisions. A linked e-prescription system cuts down on paperwork and doctor's visits and simplifies the administration of reimbursement. And based on its domestic experience Estonia is helping pioneer advances at the European level too in putting technology to work in healthcare.

There's a lot more to it than technological efficiency. The transformation that the digital society offers goes right to the heart of healthcare, and at the most human level. A digital society offers new opportunities for individuals to be involved in discussions on shaping their own pathway. The entire healthcare community becomes empowered as never before, and can acquire new levels of health literacy. It can allow individuals to engage with the public sphere in reflections on health policy, giving civil society a new stake in the search for solutions - medical, research-related, or in terms of infrastructure. People can be one of the drivers of strategy, rather than merely passive patients. They can condition policy choices by giving unprecedented profile to the needs of previously voiceless groups - such as the rare-disease community.

In this changing landscape, health and healthcare are no longer the exclusive preserve of one superior caste with one all-pervading and unquestioned monolithic view. Digital health does not dethrone or subvert the establishment, but it does introduce invaluable complementary influences. The objective of healthcare remains the same, but the mechanisms for attaining the goal are enriched as they become more diverse. To the single-minded tenacity of the fabled hedgehog is added the sense of initiative and the energetic enterprise of the wily fox - a new paradigm for a new age. The classic limitations are dissolved, and the characteristics of the fox who knows many things and the hedgehog who knows only one important thing are no longer mutually exclusive. Digital health allows for exploiting the best of both worlds - in line with the concept of valuable second opinions.

The leap forward in digital technology in general is matched by advances in healthcare that were unimagined until recently - and whose exploitation would be inconceivable without it. The rich field of genomics and the information that can flow from this new science are opening up the chance of a real understanding not just of disease but of individuals' predispositions to disease and to health. Fundamental research and clinical care in rare diseases, cancer, infectious diseases, and diseases of hitherto unfathomable complexity are together benefiting from the fine precision and the wide scope of data in the hands for the first time of scientists and physicians. This increased understanding is a key to future improvement in healthcare through personalised medicine. The possibilities of targeting treatments to those patients who will benefit are already being deployed in routine clinical practice, and are cutting the costs and consequences of misdirected care - a process of vital importance in light of the rising costs of healthcare and drug development.

The countless individual breakthroughs that make possible the development of digital technologies - and of digital health - find their true value in a context of collaboration. The investments of time, expertise, and funding among individual countries stand a greater chance of success when efforts are combined and results are shared. This is why the European Union agreed to a digital agenda - to foster innovation, economic growth, and progress.

In the healthcare field, Europe is uniquely well placed to develop this digital potential. It can realistically aspire to take on a position of global leadership, because of the quality of its science, the ingenuity of its technologists, the size of its population, the scale and cohesion of its healthcare organisations and its commitment to public funding, and the underlying consensus it espouses on the value of social solidarity.

Above all, the personalised approach to medicine that is made possible by the digital health society can contribute decisively to a radical review of healthcare. It can shape a new vision with an emphasis on overall wellness - a holistic appreciation of the inseparable factors of health maintenance, disease screening and prevention, early diagnosis, and precision care. The consequences can be a healthier society, with health systems that are both more effective and more sustainable.

But this isn't going to happen of its own volition. It requires on-the-ground implementation in healthcare, in terms of equality of care and access to treatment. It requires engagement from patients in data sharing and in active partnership in health decisions. It requires a healthcare workforce alert and open to the new possibilities and trained to realise the potential. It requires measures on data security and management, and defined standards for clinical genomics and for integration of data into health records. It requires the compilation of evidence that can persuade policymakers of the benefits, and induce regulation that promotes innovation.

Above all, it requires integration into healthcare systems by enough member states to turn vision into reality. That does not need all member states. A coordinated group of pioneers can lead the way, allowing others to join as the benefits win increasing recognition. It is the way the EU has acted in the past, and is the key as well to the way that the EU can embrace a new future, by harnessing technological potential with personal care to create a genuinely digital health society.

As Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the then President of Estonia, said in his introduction to the report of the EU Task Force on eHealth, Redesigning Health in Europe for 2020: “The task we face is to ensure that in the future all EU citizens have access to a high level of healthcare, anywhere in the Union, and at a reasonable cost to our healthcare systems. To do so, we must make use of solutions offered by information technology already today.”
