==== Body
The January 2020 issue of Animal Frontiers marks the beginning of the 10th issue of this novel forum for innovative and timely perspectives that have relevance to understanding the complex dynamics of issues relevant to international animal agriculture. EAAP—the European Federation of Animal Science—is proud to be one of the four animal science organizations that have created, managed, and published Animal Frontiers. The American Society of Animal Science (ASAS), American Meat Science Association (AMSA), and Canadian Society of Animal Science (CSAS) also contribute to the publication of Animal Frontiers and each of these societies will have the opportunity to provide their perspectives on the 10th anniversary of Animal Frontiers in subsequent issues.

When the four animal science organizations began this new adventure, I wondered how the members of EAAP would react to publication of scientific articles in such a new format—Animal Frontiers is scientific magazine with a unique style compared to our conventional, peer-reviewed scientific journals. I believed that Animal Frontiers would feel quite different to EAAP members at first. After nearly 10 years, what fueled the origin of Animal Frontiers still remains an integral part of its DNA. In every issue, we continue to fulfill the aspirations of those early years and hope that each new issue is enjoyed as much as the first issues and by a larger number of readers.

The original goals for Animal Frontiers were to create a quarterly publication focused on a current topic related to animal science with articles written by a broad range of international authors with different perspectives on the topic and to ensure that articles were written in an “easy-to-understand” manner that was useful for nonscientists such as teachers, policy makers, extension specialists, and industry professionals. In the 10 years since Animal Frontiers was launched, those original ideas are still alive. Support for the original format of Animal Frontiers continues to grow as measured by the increase in number of readers from Europe and other continents. Without a doubt, our original decision to make the online version of Animal Frontiers open access and freely available to the public from publication of the first issue onward has subsequently paved the way for other animal science magazines to use a similar publication strategy; thus, the original idea to publish a new, open access journal in international animal science was just what the global animal science community was waiting for!

The story of the first 10 years of Animal Frontiers is a story about animal science at a global scale. Going back to read the first issues and then reading all the subsequent issues (around 50 issues so far) it is easy to observe a long line of landmark publications, including the disciplines of animal science and the global livestock industry. All issues of Animal Frontiers have crosscutting interdisciplinary themes addressing the challenges of livestock industries and showing the development that our scientific disciplines have reached in the last 10 years in Europe and around the world.

We believe that the 10-year anniversary of Animal Frontiers is an international accomplishment worthy of celebration! In addition, EAAP members can be sure that we will not stop here. The four, international animal science organizations are already planning to make the second 10 years of Animal Frontiers filled with additional landmarks of interest to an even larger number of international readers, and in a few words … another decade of success!
