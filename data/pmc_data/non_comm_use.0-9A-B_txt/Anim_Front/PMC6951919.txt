Implications
Americans like meat. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Americans are poised to eat more red meat and poultry in 2018 than ever before. At the same time, we are seeing a difference in how younger consumers perceive meat and the future of meat in their diets.

An analysis of current social media conversations, as well as attitudinal research, shows a growing segment of consumers have questions about meat’s environmental and social impact, as well as nutritional benefits.

Members of the highly studied and coveted Millennial audience most likely to consider dropping meat from their diets are especially socially conscious, pride themselves in being informed and are more likely than other meat eaters to voice their opinions. This audience requires a new framework for how the food industry engages with the individuals who are shaping what and how we eat.

Communications must directly engage with targeted consumers on their terms, recognizing their concerns and connecting to their values. In addition to better communicating the nutritional benefits of meat as a source of protein, the meat industry must clearly demonstrate an understanding of what is important to this audience and more directly connect with them about the concerns they have about meat.

Introduction
Americans like meat and, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, they are poised to eat more red meat and poultry than ever before in 2018 (Figure 1; Durisin and Singh, 2018). At the same time, from market analyses, we are seeing a difference in how younger consumers perceive meat and the future of meat in their diets.

Figure 1. Americans are eating more meat today than ever before.

Meat quality and price are major decision drivers for both younger and older generations (Figure 2). However, for millennial consumers, sustainability factors, and impacts on communities are increasingly important.

Certainly, nutrition has always been an important topic for consumers. The popularity of high-protein diets, particularly within the fitness and health communities, has put meat back in the spotlight. The trend has jumped from fad diet to mainstream, picking up traction in 2018 as illustrated in social media conversations (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Protein is getting “cooler” graphic.

After our analysis of social media conversations around meat, conflicting opinions on meat become clearer. In conversations about meat and health, 22% of the conversations mention negative health effects of meat, while only 13% discuss positive effects. When we look at meat-related animal welfare conversations, 55% criticize large-scale farming and only 8% of the conversation defends it. When related to the environment, more than half of the conversations are negative, while only one-fourth mention positive environmental messages (analysis of data from Crimson Hexagon Analytics, 2017).

To better understand meat eaters, their values, and what is behind these conversations and trends, we took a closer look at consumer subsegments.

Audience Segmentation
Millennials drive much of the conversation around diet and health, particularly as it relates to diets that do or do not include meat. While it is believed that a large concentration of vegetarians exists within the Millennial generation, less than 10% identify as vegetarian. Even more interesting is how Millennials define vegetarianism. Of the 8% of Millennials who identify as vegetarian, when surveyed, 51% report they have consumed meat in the last week alone. That percentage increases to 63% when we look at the last 6 mo (Simmons Research, 2017). This indicates Millennials’ definition of vegetarianism is fluid and more lax than how previous generations defined it.

To better understand the 92% of Millennials who say they regularly consume meat, we conducted an audience segmentation exercise to narrow the broad audience into specific groups of people with shared passions, attitudes, and behaviors. Through sophisticated data segmentation (utilizing Simmons Research data), we narrowed meat-eating Millennials in the United States into four distinct audience segments (Figure 4):
Bulking Bros (14 million) consist primarily of men who live active lifestyles, play sports, are natural risk takers, and live a typical party lifestyle.

Meat & Potato-Eaters (13 million) are also comprised primarily of men, but tend like control and place a great deal of importance on being seen as successful by their family.

Family Feeders (20 million) are primarily women focused on convenience. Their children influence most of their decisions.

Balance-Seekers (22 million) are primarily women who are focused on their careers and are influenced by arts and culture. They live active lifestyles and try to maintain balanced diets.



Figure 4. Millennial segmentation graphic.

Digging even deeper, we looked into each audience segment’s attitudes and behaviors surrounding three key themes: the environment, nutrition, and the loudness of their voices. To better quantify this, we created index scores for each category by normalizing these data (Figure 5).

Figure 5. Millennial differences graphic.

To understand just how committed the different segments are to meat consumption, we looked back at the vegetarian audience and extracted common core values among the entire group. We then analyzed those values against our four meat-eating Millennial segments. The values consisted of a range of factors including how easily they are influenced, willingness to try new things, comfortableness going against the grain, and more. Similarly to the index score created for each category, we created a commitment score. The higher the score, the more committed the segment was to a diet including meat (Simmons Research, 2017).

A review of the index and commitment scores indicates the Balance-Seeker audience segment has the loudest voice and most influence on others’ behaviors and attitudes. Members of this audience also have the lowest commitment score, which means their more likely to consider dropping meat from their diet. And, they consistently express concern for the environment and health and nutrition. The combination of these factors creates both a challenge and opportunity for the meat industry, which makes the Balance-Seekers a priority target audience:
This group makes up roughly one third of Millennials who eat meat, so it represents a substantial audience to target.

This segment is the most at risk for eliminating meat from their diets.

They pride themselves in being well-informed, so they have a high propensity to look for answers to their questions.

This group is comfortable sharing their opinions with others and is naturally influential.



Socially Conscious is Sexy
Making this audience a priority requires a new framework for how the industry engages with the people shaping what and how we eat. Underlying these rationale for why people make decisions about food are motivations, which are not always apparent. Determining the “why” behind the information and data gives us insight into consumer attitudes and authentically underpins our course of action. If we can understand why consumer groups think, feel, or act a certain way, we can develop communications to align with their motivations. Defining an audience insight requires assessment of a combination of information including the cultural and category trends, products, and the audience. While several learnings and takeaways are revealed after combing through these data, one particular point was utilized to determine the insight to drive our communication. From our attitudinal segmentation based on the Experian Simmons National Consumer Survey Study, approximately 22 M Millennials who were nutritiously savvy showed they were most likely to shift away from eating meat (Experian, 2017). A root-cause exercise was performed on these data in order to derive our insight that for this segment: “Socially Conscious Is Sexy”. Our audience has questions about meat based on what they see and hear, and, as social listening indicated, they are primarily hearing concerns and seeing negative information. This situation causes the perpetuation of myths and misunderstandings that inform this group’s opinions. And because there is a gap in positive and affirming meat information, the negativity influences their decision to stop or curb eating meat. While a wealth of knowledge exists to help address these concerns and educate consumers, to the message must be more directly linked to consumer values. The Balance Seekers need help in understanding how meat fits in their socially conscious paradigm.

Path Forward: Real Meat = Greater MEat
Taking this approach requires shifting from a defensive posture to more actively and directly engaging with consumers on their terms, recognizing their concerns and their values.

To make meat consumption a socially conscious choice, these consumers must be in the center of the discussion to elevate the confidence in their attitude toward and choice of consuming real meat. For these consumers, it is about “The Greater MEat”, which puts meat in their terms, aligns with their values and bolsters their sense of continual discovery to achieve better balance and contentment. It helps show how meat fits into their quest for a “greater me”–without being heavy-handed and preachy. Our Balance-Seekers’ antenna is always up to find hacks that make life easier or new approaches to make life better. They are not seeking perfection, but they do seek improvement, which can come from greater understanding, greater success, and the greater good. To do this, we need to elevate perceptual barriers to choosing meat and address important social concerns.

Creating Passionate (and Authentic) Conversations
The Pew Institute reported last year that two-thirds of Americans receive at least some of their news from social platforms (Shearer and Gottfried, 2017). This shift means audiences are curating and personalizing their information sources more than ever. At the same time, as trust in institutions declines, trust in individual influencers continues to grow. In fact, 92% of consumers are more likely to trust peers over advertising when it comes to purchase decisions (Morrison, 2015), and 83% will take an action based on the reviews and recommendations of trusted sources (McCaskill, 2015).

More than ever, the meat industry message must fit into the content that the audience is choosing to consume. That means providing interesting, high-quality content that naturally fits into the information regularly shared by an individual who has already gained his or her audiences’ trust. For the meat industry, this is good news. Based on our audience research, we see a group of individuals passionate about meat whose voices can be strengthened, as well as a group of passionate voices who can be engaged in discussions about healthfulness, social responsibility, and balance.

For members involved in every segment of the production of animal source foods, especially meat, opportunity to engage with influencers is available. Action can be driven by creating experiences centered in mutual consumer passion points.

When many people hear the term “online influencer,” visions of the Kardashians and multiple Bachelor and Bachelorette contestants probably come to mind. While those names pack a lot of punch in terms of volume, the meat industry should be more concerned about trust and credibility. That is where the microinfluencer comes into play.

While microinfluencers may have less reach and fewer followers, they offer authenticity to their audiences and, in turn, gain greater trust from their followers. As a recent Forbes article put it, “When aligned with their values, lifestyle, interests and hobbies, everyday consumers are enthusiastic about the opportunity to influence their network. In fact, alignment between the product and lifestyle is an essential factor in this type of influencers’ ability, and willingness, to make an authentic recommendation . . . if the product doesn’t fit with their personal brand – and everyone has a personal brand in this day and age – these influencers won’t talk about it. If they do talk about it, their network will sniff out the inauthenticity a mile away and their influence will be diminished.” (Krebs, 2017).

While the pool of influencers may seem unwieldy and overwhelming, structure exists to identify, develop relationships, and deliver great content and measurement results with influencers who talk about everything from making socially conscious food choices to making sure your kids actually eat some form of protein for dinner.

And that world holds great opportunity for the meat industry. In part because people want to talk about meat. This industry has a great story to tell and has action to back up the story. Empowering trusted voices to share their perspective of the Greater MEat creates an opportunity to demonstrate all the research, investment, and progress made toward producing an even more socially conscious, nutritious product.
