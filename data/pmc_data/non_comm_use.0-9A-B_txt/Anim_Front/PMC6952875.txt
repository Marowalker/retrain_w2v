==== Body
In 2020, we celebrate the first 10 years of publishing Animal Frontiers, an official journal of the American Society of Animal Science (ASAS); the Canadian Society of Animal Science (CSAS); the European Federation of Animal Science (EAAP); and the American Meat Science Association (AMSA). All four societies are dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of science-based knowledge concerning animal agriculture.


Animal Frontiers provides a novel forum for innovative, timely, and international perspectives that have relevance to understanding the complex dynamics of high-impact, global issues at work through animal agriculture. Animal Frontiers is a quarterly publication and every issue explores a theme of broad and current interest within animal science and animal agriculture. During the first 9 years of Animal Frontiers, some of these themes focused on disciplines associated with animal science, such as reproduction (Flowers, 2013; Chavatte-Palmer and Mermillod, 2015), genomics (Bagnato and Rosati, 2012; Ibanez-Escriche and Simianer, 2016), or health (Lefrancois and Pineau, 2014) while other issues focused on somewhat contentious issues such as animal welfare (Lay, 2012), carbon footprints (Zinn, 2011), climate change (Bernabucci, 2019), effective communication (Hamernik and Johnson, 2015), the human–animal bond (Zinn and Beck, 2014), the definition of meat (Dilger, 2017), or water use (Girard, 2012).

The current issue of Animal Frontiers focuses on ethical considerations related to the production of animal-sourced foods (Gremmen, 2020). The ethics of animal production for production of meat, milk, and eggs for human consumption is an increasingly discussed contemporary issue throughout the developed world. In dealing with complicated issues, the Animal Frontiers Management Board recognizes that it is important to understand different opinions and perspectives. In this issue of Animal Frontiers, ethical issues are presented mainly from philosophical perspectives to reflect on implicit and explicit moral assumptions of animal scientists. The papers in this issue of Animal Frontiers follow a philosophical logic rather than a science-based approach to the topic. The opinions expressed in this issue of Animal Frontiers are those of the authors and do not reflect those of the members of the Animal Frontiers Management Board and the scientific societies they represent. Questions may be directed to Deb Hamernik (dhamernik2@unl.edu), Editor-in-Chief, Animal Frontiers.
