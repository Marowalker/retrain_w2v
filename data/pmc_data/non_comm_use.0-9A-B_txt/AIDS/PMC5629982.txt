This article compares trends in CD4+ T-cell recovery and proportions achieving optimal restoration (≥500 cells/μl) after viral suppression following combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) initiation between rapid and nonrapid progressors.

Methods:
We included HIV-1 seroconverters achieving viral suppression within 6 months of cART. Rapid progressors were individuals experiencing at least one CD4+ less than 200 cells/μl within 12 months of seroconverters before cART. We used piecewise linear mixed models and logistic regression for optimal restoration.

Results:
Of 4024 individuals, 294 (7.3%) were classified as rapid progressors. At the same CD4+ T-cell count at cART start (baseline), rapid progressors experienced faster CD4+ T-cell increases than nonrapid progressors in first month [difference (95% confidence interval) in mean increase/month (square root scale): 1.82 (1.61; 2.04)], which reversed to slightly slower increases in months 1–18 [−0.05 (−0.06; −0.03)] and no significant differences in 18–60 months [−0.003 (−0.01; 0.01)]. Percentage achieving optimal restoration was significantly lower for rapid progressors than nonrapid progressors at months 12 (29.2 vs. 62.5%) and 36 (47.1 vs. 72.4%) but not at month 60 (70.4 vs. 71.8%). These differences disappeared after adjusting for baseline CD4+ T-cell count: odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.86 (0.61; 1.20), 0.90 (0.38; 2.17) and 1.56 (0.55; 4.46) at months 12, 36 and 60, respectively.

Conclusion:
Among people on suppressive antiretroviral therapy, rapid progressors experience faster initial increases of CD4+ T-cell counts than nonrapid progressors, but are less likely to achieve optimal restoration during the first 36 months after cART, mainly because of lower CD4+ T-cell counts at cART initiation.

Introduction
Humans show a remarkable variation in clinical outcomes following HIV-1 infection. Although some individuals are able to control HIV replication for long periods (elite controllers), others experience rapid CD4+ T-cell loss after seroconversion (rapid progressors) in the absence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) [1–2]. Over the last few years, many studies have focused on these extreme HIV phenotypes in a search for clues relating to viral pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that a combination of viral and host factors play a role in HIV disease outcomes [3–7].

Rapid HIV progression is defined by a decay of CD4+ T-cell counts below a threshold ranging between 100 and 350 cells/μl in a time frame from 6 months to 3 years [2,5] after seroconversion. Studies of rapid progressors have been limited by small numbers [7–9] and by the heterogeneity of definitions used for rapid progressors. Both a documented seroconversion date and a narrow seroconversion window are generally required to characterize these uncommon phenotypes. Indeed, Muñoz et al.[10] reported frequency of the rapid progressors to be under 10% in the MACS, and Rotger et al.[5] reported that approximately 8% of seroconverters in the Swiss cohort were rapid progressors. Recently, Olson et al.[2] showed that 2.8, 7.3 and 24.9% of seroconverters in the Concerted Action of Seroconversion to AIDS and Death in Europe (CASCADE) Collaboration experienced at least one CD4+ cell count less than 100, 200 and 350 cells/μl, respectively, within 1 year of seroconverters.

Rapid progression could be clinically relevant for immune restoration after cART initiation as poorer CD4+ T-cell recovery has been associated with low CD4+ T-cell counts at the initiation of therapy in a cross-sectional study [11]. However, the link between rapid progression and immune recovery is unknown.

The CASCADE Collaboration has previously reported that individuals with steeper precART CD4+ T-cell decline are more likely to experience greater CD4+ T-cell increases after cART [12] but did not examine if these responses varied among those who are virologically suppressed. Several studies have revealed a substantial prevalence of immunological nonresponders among patients who are virologically suppressed on cART, with rates ranging from 17 to 40%, depending on the study criteria and the population [13–15]. Compared with concordant responders (i.e. those with a good CD4+ T-cell response while virally suppressed on cART), these nonconcordant responders are at increased risk of clinical progression to AIDS-related and non–AIDS-related illnesses and death [11,13,16–23].

We hypothesized that rapid progression before cART initiation predicts poor CD4+ T-cell recovery in virologically suppressed individuals and hinders optimal CD4+ T-cell restoration. The objective of this analysis was, therefore, to compare trends in CD4+ T-cell recovery after cART initiation and the proportion achieving counts at least 500 cells/μl after 12, 36 and 60 months between rapid and nonrapid progressors achieving virological suppression.

Methods
Ethics statement
All collaborating cohorts received approval from their respective or national ethics review boards. Ethics approval for CASCADE collaborating cohorts within EuroCoord has been granted by the committees detailed in the ‘Acknowledgements’ section.

Study population
We used data from CASCADE, updated in 2013 within EuroCoord (www.EuroCoord.net), which consists of 29 884 individuals with well estimated dates of HIV seroconversion (seroconverters) from 28 cohorts across Europe, Canada, Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa [24]. Individuals followed-up in the two African cohorts were excluded as both CD4+ T-cell count evolution during natural history and treatment guidelines applied to these populations differ from those in high-income countries [25]. We also excluded individuals infected through a route other than injecting drug use or sexual intercourse (i.e. haemophilia, transfusion, other and unknown) to avoid other clinical complications that affect HIV disease progression. Eligible individuals were patients initiating their first cART regimen from naive and who achieved viral suppression (plasma HIV-RNA level ≤200 copies/ml) within the first 6 months of therapy and maintained it thereafter until their censoring date. Patients had to have both CD4+ T-cell counts and HIV-RNA measurements available at start of cART (i.e. within the last 6 months prior to cART initiation). Individuals with a viral load less than 1000 copies/ml at the time of starting cART were excluded as they may have been misclassified as treatment naïve. Furthermore, to be able to classify patients as rapid or nonrapid progressors, we required that seroconversion dates were estimated in one of three ways: as the midpoint between the last negative and first positive HIV antibody test dates with an interval of less than 12 months between tests, as the date of laboratory evidence of acute seroconversion (PCR positivity in the absence of HIV antibodies or antigen positivity with fewer than four bands on Western blot), or as the date of seroconversion illness for individuals with a test interval of 12 months or less. Patients also had to have at least one CD4+ T-cell count within the first 12 months of seroconversion in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

Individuals were classified as rapid progressors if there was at least one determination of CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200 cells/μl within 12 months from seroconverters before ART initiation, and as nonrapid progressors otherwise. Additional definitions were also tested [2], and more details are provided in the sensitivity analyses section.

Follow-up time started at cART initiation and was censored at the first of the following dates: the first of two consecutive occasions when the plasma HIV-RNA level increased above 200 copies/ml (considered to be treatment failure), the first of two consecutive HIV-RNA measurements separated by more than 12 months (considered to be lost to follow-up) or at the last date when an HIV-RNA measurement was available within 60 months of starting therapy. Patients who modified their cART regimens were not censored at date of modification, provided plasma HIV-RNA levels remained 200 copies/ml or less.

CART was defined as a protease inhibitor-based, nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), or fusion inhibitor-based regimen, in combination with at least two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, or a triple nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimen including abacavir or tenofovir.

Statistical analysis
Differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between rapid and nonrapid progressors were assessed through the nonparametric Mann–Whitney test for continuous variables and the χ2 test for independence for categorical variables.

Trends in CD4+ T-cell counts after cART initiation were modelled using a piecewise linear mixed-effects model (to take into account the correlation between measurements in the same individual) with three slopes (including random effects for the intercept and the three slopes); the best model (Akaike criterion) obtained allowed for changes of slopes at months 1 and 18. The square root transformation of the CD4+ T-cell counts was used to fulfil the model assumptions.

As an initial approach, multivariable piecewise linear mixed-effects models were initially adjusted for sex, age at cART initiation, risk group (MSM, sex between men and women, IDUs), geographical origin (non-sub-Saharan Africa, migrants from sub-Saharan Africa, unknown) used as a proxy for HIV subtype and log10 HIV-RNA levels at cART initiation. However, as CD4+ T-cell count at cART initiation is known to be a strong predictor of immunological outcome and is significantly lower in rapid progressors, this initial approach was confounded by the CD4+ T-cell counts at cART initiation. As attempting to remove this confounding by including the observed CD4+ T-cell counts at cART initiation as a covariate in a model for later measurements is likely to introduce bias, we used a method based on first following the initial approach and then applying a correction to the parameter estimates to compare rapid and nonrapid progressors with the same underlying CD4+ T-cell counts at start of cART [26].

We calculated the proportion of patients who experienced an optimal CD4+ T-cell restoration, defined as achieving CD4+ T-cell counts of at least 500 cells/μl, at 12, 36 and 60 (±3) months from cART initiation and used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for association between rapid progressors status and optimal CD4+ T-cell count restoration. Multivariate logistic regression models were initially adjusted for the same factors as in the piecewise linear mixed-effects models, and additionally adjusted for CD4+ T-cell count at cART initiation (<100, 100–199, ≥200).

A set of sensitivity analyses was undertaken. Analyses were repeated using 100 and 350 as CD4+ T-cell thresholds to define rapid progressors; considering the first 6 months from seroconverters to classify patients as rapid and nonrapid progressors; defining an optimal CD4+ T-cell restoration as achieving CD4+ T-cell counts of at least 600 cells/μl; restricting to individuals who started cART with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200 cells/μl; restricting to patients who started cART after year 2000 when boosted protease inhibitors became widely available and allowing patients to achieve viral suppression within the first 12 months of therapy as patients with high viral loads and those on protease inhibitor-based regimen may not suppress by 6 months yet nonetheless by 12 months.

All statistical analyses were performed by using Stata software (version 13.1; StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).

Results
Study population characteristics
Of 29 884 individuals, 25 860 were excluded from analyses as follows: 916 followed-up in two African cohorts, 1520 who were infected through a route other than injecting drug use or sexual intercourse (157 haemophilia, 44 transfusion, 184 other and 1135 unknown), 9716 who never initiated cART, 5347 who were ART experienced at cART initiation, 4009 who did not achieve viral suppression within the first 6 months of therapy, 691 as CD4+ T-cell count and/or HIV-RNA measurements at cART initiation were not available, 485 who had a viral load at cART initiation less than 1000 copies/ml, 2680 for whom seroconversion date was above 12 months after the last negative test and 496 as CD4+ T-cell count within 12 months from seroconverters in the absence of ART was not available.

Of 4024 individuals included in the analyses, 294 (7.3%) were classified as rapid progressors, who were more likely than nonrapid progressors to be women (17.7 vs. 11.2%), infected through sex between men and women (30.9 vs. 18.2%), migrants originating from sub-Saharan Africa (12.6 vs. 3.9%) and, when they subsequently started cART, did so at with higher log10 HIV-RNA levels (5.1 vs. 4.8) and lower CD4+ T-cell counts (164 vs. 350) (Table 1).

Trends in CD4+ T-cell counts after combination antiretroviral therapy initiation
A total of 40 893 CD4+ T-cell count measurements were available post-cART initiation, 3451 among rapid progressors and 37 442 among nonrapid progressors. The median number of CD4+ T-cell counts measurements per individual was 10 [interquartile range (IQR): 6; 16] for rapid progressors and 9 (IQR: 5; 14) for nonrapid progressors with a median interval of 2.8 (IQR: 2.3; 3.5) and 2.9 (2.2; 3.6) months between consecutive determinations for rapid and non-rapid progressors, respectively.

Median CD4+ T-cell count profiles for rapid and nonrapid progressors, overall and among individuals who started cART with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200 cells/μl, are shown in Fig. 1. Unadjusted and adjusted trends in CD4+ T-cell counts after cART initiation from the piecewise linear mixed-effects model at 0–1, 1–18 and more than 18 months are given in Table 2. After initial adjustment for sex, risk group, geographical origin, age and log10 HIV-RNA level at cART initiation, rapid progressors had faster initial and long-term CD4+ T-cell increases than nonrapid progressors: differences in mean CD4+ increase/month (square root scale) were 1.34 (95% CI: 0.95; 1.72, P < 0.001) in 0–1 months, 0.03 (−0.001; 0.05, P = 0.063) in 1–18 months and 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02; 0.06, P < 0.001) in 18–60 months. Applying the postestimation adjustment procedure [26] to compare rapid and nonrapid progressors with the same underlying CD4+ T-cell counts at cART initiation, we found that rapid progressors experienced a faster CD4+ T-cell increase than nonrapid progressors in 0–1 months (1.82, 95% CI: 1.61; 2.04, P < 0.001), which reversed to slightly slower increases in months 1–18 (−0.05, −0.06; −0.03, P < 0.001) and no significant differences in months 18–60 (−0.003, 95% CI: −0.01; 0.01, P = 0.62) (Table 2).

Figure 2a depicts the evolution of CD4+ T-cell counts for rapid and nonrapid progressors MSM of 30 years of age, of non-sub-Saharan African origin who started cART at 5 log10 HIV-1 RNA. It shows how rapid progressors, in spite of steeper initial CD4+ T-cell counts increases, fail to reach the threshold of 500 cells/μl until month 36. Figure 2b illustrates the same changes comparing rapid and nonrapid progressors who start cART at CD4+ T-cell count of 180 cells/μl. Figure 2b also shows rapid progressors having steeper initial CD4+ T-cell count increases but given that nonrapid progressors are now ‘forced’ to start cART at the same CD4+ T-cell count, rapid progressors maintain higher values to month 60.

Analyses using 100 and 350 cells/μl as CD4+ T-cell thresholds to define rapid progressors led to results consistent with those of the main analyses although differences in mean CD4+ increase/month between rapid and nonrapid progressors were attenuated when considering 350 cells/μl as the CD4+ T-cell threshold. Similar results were also obtained when the first 6 months from seroconverters were used to classify patients as rapid and nonrapid progressors, when analyses were restricted to individuals who started cART after year 2000. Restricting analyses to individuals who initiated cART with CD4+ T-cell counts less than 200 cells/μl yielded results similar to those obtained when using an adjustment procedure [26]. Allowing patients to achieve viral suppression within the first 12 months of therapy yielded results consistent with those of the main analyses.

CD4+ T-cell count restoration (≥ 500 cells/μl) following suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy
Among 4024 eligible patients, a total of 3092, 1379 and 484 were available for CD4+ T-cell analyses at 12, 36 and 60 months, respectively. Patients with missing data were more likely than persons with available measurements to be younger at cART initiation, infected through injecting drug use and to have started cART in more recent years with higher CD4+ T-cell counts. The percentage of patients experiencing optimal restoration of CD4+ T-cell counts of at least 500 cells/μl was significantly lower among rapid than nonrapid progressors at months 12 (29.2 vs. 62.5%) and 36 (47.1 vs. 72.4%) but no differences were found at month 60 (70.4 vs. 71.8%). After initial adjustment for sex, risk group, geographical origin, age and log10 HIV-RNA level at cART initiation, rapid progressors remained less likely to achieve counts of at least 500 cells/μl at months 12 (OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.13; 0.36, P < 0.001) and 36 (OR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.11; 0.87, P = 0.03), a difference that disappeared at month 60 (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.30; 2.09, P = 0.63). Additional adjustment for CD4+ T-cell counts at cART initiation (<100, 100–199, ≥200), however, showed no differences between rapid and nonrapid progressors at 12 (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.61; 1.20, P = 0.36), 36 (OR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.38; 2.17, P = 0.82) or 60 months (OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 0.55; 4.46, P = 0.40) (Table 3). Similar results were obtained when using 600 as a cutoff to define optimal CD4+ T-cell restoration (data not shown).

Analyses defining an optimal CD4+ T-cell restoration as achieving CD4+ T-cell counts of at least 600 cells/μl led to results consistent with those of the main analyses. In addition, performing the other procedures of sensitivity analyses mentioned earlier yielded results consistent with those of the main analysis (data not shown).

Discussion
Rapid progression prior to cART initiation hinders optimal CD4+ T-cell recovery once HIV-1 suppressive response to cART is achieved. Although rapid progressors experience faster initial increases in CD4+ T-cells than nonrapid progressors, they are less likely to achieve CD4+ T-cell counts of at least 500 cells/μl during the first 36 months after cART. These outcomes are largely explained by their lower CD4+ T-cell counts at cART initiation.

Our current work builds on previous work conducted by the CASCADE Collaboration showing that individuals with a faster rate of CD4+ T-cell loss precART tended to experience faster immune reconstitution once they started cART, independently of baseline CD4+ T-cell count and plasma HIV-RNA value [12]. We show that rapid progressors who achieve suppressive response to cART experience delays in achieving optimal CD4+ count recovery during the first 36 months after cART, which puts them at a higher risk of developing immunodeficiency-related complications. That this may happen in a nonnegligible proportion of the population is of concern. In our study, 7.3% of HIV-1 seroconverters fulfilled the criteria of rapid progression, a similar percentage to that previously reported in other studies [2,5,10], although study populations were not strictly comparable.

When comparing the outcomes of these rapid progressors with patients whose progression was not rapid, but whose CD4+ T-cell count at cART was similar, the differences in CD4+ T-cell responses largely disappeared. Nevertheless, steeper CD4+ T-cell responses were still experienced by the rapid progressors suggesting that a prior faster decline may allow mounting enhanced responses. It could be that the rapid loss of CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood observed in rapid progressors is secondary to cell redistribution in lymph nodes in a higher proportion than in nonrapid progressors, as well as to cellular death. Thus, recovery is bound to be more rapid once HIV viral replication is suppressed and thus the cause of the redistribution is eliminated [27,28]. This suggests that not only the absolute CD4+ T-cell value but also the time to reach that value influences responses to cART in virally suppressed individuals; cART may elicit better CD4+ T-cell responses in a time window before deep immunological damage has been caused.

These data confirm the potency of current cART regimes in their ability to reduce viremia and thus facilitate subsequent immune recovery of CD4+ T cells, even among those who had experienced rapid progression to low CD4+ count prior to starting cART. However, the similar dynamics in the recovery of CD4+ T cells after the first month of therapy prevents rapid progressors from fully recovering from their profound initial loss of cells.

This study has some limitations. First, the high proportion of patients with missing data made it difficult to assess CD4+ T-cell count restoration at 12, 36 and, especially, 60 months after cART initiation. However, as missingness appeared not related to status of the rapid progressors, there is no reason to believe that this should influence our results. Second, in 3.7% of seroconverters (1.7% in rapid progressors and 3.8% in nonrapid progressors), seroconversion date was estimated as the date of seroconversion illness, which has been associated with faster disease progression [29]. However, in sensitivity analyses excluding these patients, results were consistent with those of the main analyses. Third, although our work is based on HIV-1 seroconverters who are unlikely to be comparable with the general HIV-infected population in a number of ways, it has been recently shown that there are no major differences in HIV disease progression between seroconverters and seroprevalent individuals [30] suggesting that our results are generalizable to the HIV-positive population.

Our findings have implications for public health policy, clinical management and basic science research. Ideally, cART should be started as soon as possible after HIV-1 diagnosis regardless of the CD4 T-cell count (START study: http://www.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/Archive/2011/Pages/START.aspx).

However, in clinical settings wherein cART is not widely available, our results would support strategies that promote frequent testing to reduce the proportion of patients initiating cART at low CD4+ T-cell counts, which is largely secondary to delayed HIV-1 diagnoses. For those testing early, we suggest frequent CD4+ T-cell count monitoring close to the time of HIV diagnoses to establish the rapid progressors phenotype in order to avoid unnecessary CD4+ T-cell count decay among rapid progressors. Finally, elucidating the immunopathological bases of rapid progression should help to improve individual clinical outcome and limit its impact in the global HIV-1 pandemics.
