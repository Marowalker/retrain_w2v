==== Body
In the article, “The role of shear stress and arteriogenesis in maintaining vascular homeostasis and preventing cerebral atherosclerosis”, which appeared in the pages 53-62, issue 1, vol. 1 of Brain Circulation[1], [Table 1] which appeared in page 56, the arrow shown for the second column heading “Decrease” of the table was incorrectly written as an upward arrow “↑” instead of a downward arrow “↓”. [Table 1] is in continuation in the second column of the same page having the incorrect upward arrow “↑” shown for “Decrease” in the second column heading of the table instead of a downward arrow “↓”.

These have now been corrected and reposted online.
