==== Body
Little is known about the influence of cervical spine curvature (cervical lordosis) and cerebral blood flow, but it has been reported that the loss of cervical lordosis results in a decrease in vertebral artery blood flow. The authors of this retrospective study, therefore, hypothesized that improvement of cervical hypolordosis via cervical adjustments would increase cerebral circulation. This is what the study showed; however, while the premise of the study is laudable, there are some challenges in interpreting the findings of this paper. First, there are no control data and very small sample size with a restricted age range of the study. This means that it is hard to make validated conclusions from this study, and as the authors indicate, further controlled, a priori studies with much larger patient populations and regions of cerebral blood flow are needed to confirm these findings and understand the clinical implications.
