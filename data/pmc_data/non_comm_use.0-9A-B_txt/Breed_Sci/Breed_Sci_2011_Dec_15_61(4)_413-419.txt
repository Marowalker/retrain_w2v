This species shows a wide morphological diversity, and is an important vegetable especially in Asia. However, molecular research of radish is behind compared to that of Brassica. For example, reports on SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers are limited. Here, we designed 417 radish SSR markers from SSR-enriched genomic libraries and the cDNA data. Of the 256 SSR markers succeeded in PCR, 130 showed clear polymorphisms between two radish lines; a rat-tail radish and a Japanese cultivar, ‘Harufuku’. As a test case for evaluation of the present SSRs, we conducted two studies. First, we selected 16 SSRs to calculate polymorphism information contents (PICs) using 16 radish cultivars and four other Brassicaceae species. These markers detected 3–15 alleles (average = 9.6). PIC values ranged from 0.54 to 0.92 (average = 0.78). Second, part of the present SSRs were tested for mapping using our previously-examined mapping population. The map spanned 672.7 cM with nine linkage groups (LGs). The 21 radish SSR markers were distributed throughout the LGs. The SSR markers developed here would be informative and useful for genetic analysis in radish and its related species.

Introduction
Radish (Raphanus sativus L., 2n = 18) is a member of Brassicaceae family, and has a relatively small genome size. The size is similar to those of other Brassicaceae species such as Brassica rapa (Johnston et al. 2005). Radish is thought to have originated in Mediterranean areas, and is now widely cultivated in East Asian countries as an important vegetable root crop (Kaneko et al. 2007). The edible part of this crop is called root, but in histology, it consists of the true root and the hypocotyl. A wide morphological diversity of this part is known in this species, and many cultivars having various shapes of thickened root have been developed in East Asia (Kitamura 1958). In contrast, a rat-tail radish produces no thickened root, and is cultivated in tropical Asia for edible puffed pods (Banga 1976).

Though radish has an extreme importance from the economic and agricultural views, molecular research of radish such as genome mapping and genetic diversity is behind compared to that of Brassica species. Molecular markers have been extensively used to study genetic diversity, genetic relationships and mapping studies in various crop species. Of these, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites are frequently utilized as DNA markers. The SSR is a DNA repeat consisting of 1–6 nucleotide repeat units, abundantly distributed in most eukaryotic genomes. The SSR marker has the advantages of high variability, ease of detection, codominant inheritance nature, and good transferability between populations and in different research groups (see Jones et al. 2009 for a review). For these reasons, SSRs have become an important marker system in cultivar fingerprinting, diversity studies, molecular mapping and marker-assisted selection. On the other hand, because isolation of SSRs and establishment of the specific primers generally require high cost and a long development time, the number of available SSR markers differs in species. Actually, despite a number of SSR markers in Brassica species, there have been only a few reports on development of SSR markers in radish (Kamei et al. 2010, Ohsako et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2007, Yamane et al. 2009). In the previous studies, we have made linkage maps of radish to detect loci for morphological characters and clubroot resistance (Kamei et al. 2010, Tsuro et al. 2005, 2008). Even including our efforts, reports on the linkage map are still limited in radish compared to other Brassicaceae species (Bett and Lydiate 2003, Budahn et al. 2009, Kamei et al. 2010, Tsuro et al. 2005, 2008). Since limited numbers of SSR markers were used in these studies, correspondence of the published linkage groups (LGs) is mostly unclear. Under such circumstances, increasing the number of available SSR markers would be of importance to conduct further genetic studies in radish.

Here, we designed a total of 417 SSR primer pairs in radish from SSR-enriched genomic libraries and cDNA data in the database. Utilities of the radish SSR markers were tested in the two following ways. To assess the usefulness of these markers among radish and other related species in Brassicaceae, the polymorphism information contents (PICs) were calculated. Of the 73 SSR markers tested for mapping, 21 markers were located on a radish linkage map. These results showed effectiveness of the SSRs for mapping study in addition to potential utility for the genetic diversity analysis.

Materials and Methods
Plant materials and DNA extraction
Three following radish lines were used for preparing genomic DNA libraries; a rat-tail radish, a Japanese cultivar, ‘Harufuku’, and an F1 plant derived from a cross between them. The homozygosity of the two parental lines was increased by five or six successive selfings. DNA was extracted from plant leaves using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). For allele analysis, 16 radish cultivars and four lines of other Brassicaceae species were used (Table 1).

Development of SSR markers
The SSR-enriched genomic DNA libraries were constructed according to Nunome et al. (2006). The SSR-enriched fragments were ligated into a pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Resultant plasmids were used to transform TOP10 competent cells (Invitrogen). Clones with a 0.5–1.5 kb insert were sequenced using a CEQ8800XL sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Nucleotide sequences of 47 redundant clones were removed manually. Nucleotide sequence data of the genomic SSRs developed here are deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession nos. AB425071, AB425072, AB425076-AB425078 and AB608338-AB608637 (Supplemental Table 1). EST-SSR markers were designed from cDNA contig data in the RadishDB (http://radish.plantbiology.msu.edu). Sequences containing SSR with >10 mononucleotide, >6 dinucleotide and >5 trinucleotide repeats were used for primer design as described previously (Hirai et al. 2010, Kubo et al. 2009). Primers were designed using the Primer3 software (Rozen and Skaletsky 2000). Amplification of primer pairs was tested in the two radish lines above. PCR amplification was carried out as described previously (Saito et al. 2006). The annealing temperature was initially fixed at 50°C and then slight modifications were made to achieve optimal amplification (Supplemental Table 1). The amplified products were electrophoresed in a 3% agarose gel or with the CEQ8800XL sequencer (Beckman Coulter). Primer pairs showing clear polymorphic bands in these lines were then used for further analysis.

Fragment analysis and allele detection
Out of the developed SSRs, 16 primer pairs were used for the analysis of cultivars listed in Table 1. The 5′-end of forward primer was labeled with a fluorescent dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and PCR amplification was carried out as described above. The fragment sizes of SSR loci were analyzed with the CEQ8800XL sequencer (Beckman Coulter). The value of the polymorphic information content (PIC) at each locus was calculated for the 16 radish cultivars as described (Anderson et al. 1993).

Linkage mapping
An improved linkage map of radish has been developed in this study based on our previous data (Tsuro et al. 2008) plus the SSR marker data as described below. For the mapping, 73 radish SSR markers developed here, seven already-reported radish SSRs (Kamei et al. 2010, Ohsako et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2007) and six B. rapa SSRs (Suwabe et al. 2002, 2006) were newly tested in this study. The polymorphic markers were then used for scoring the segregation in the F2 population (n = 106) (Tsuro et al. 2008). Linkage analysis was performed using the JoinMap ver. 3.0 software (Van Ooijen and Voorrips 2001), but markers deviating significantly (P < 0.001) from the expected segregation ratio were excluded from the analysis. The Kosambi map function (Kosambi 1944) was used to calculate the genetic distance between markers.

Results
Development of SSR markers in radish
Three SSR-enriched libraries were developed from the two radish lines (rat-tail radish and ‘Harufuku’) and their F1 plant. From the rat-tailed radish library, 326 clones were sequenced. Similarly, 92 and 299 clones were sequenced from ‘Harufuku’ and the F1 plant libraries, respectively (Table 2). Of these, 245 (75.2%), 63 (68.5%) and 191 (63.9%) contained SSR motifs in the sequenced clones, respectively. Out of the 293 primer pairs initially designed from the non-redundant SSR-containing sequences, 156 primer pairs amplified clear bands. Of the 156 pairs succeeded in PCR, 90 primer pairs (57.7%) showed polymorphisms between the two radish lines (Table 2). We also designed 124 primer pairs of EST-SSRs from cDNA contig data in the RadishDB. Of these EST-based primer pairs, 100 produced clear bands within the predicted size range. Of the 100 successful EST-SSRs, 40 primer pairs (40.0%) showed polymorphisms between the two radish lines (Table 2). Finally, 256 SSR markers (156 genomic and 100 EST-SSRs) resulted in clear bands, of which 130 markers were polymorphic between the two radish lines (Table 2 and bold types in Supplemental Table 1).

Assessment of SSR polymorphisms by a fragment analysis
Out of the primers that amplified clear polymorphic bands, 16 SSR loci were tested for the ability to detect alleles using radish cultivars (Table 3). Of the markers tested, 13 primer pairs amplified clear polymorphic bands for all the 16 radish cultivars (Table 4). These markers detected 3–15 alleles with an average of 9.6. PIC values ranged from 0.54 to 0.92 with an average of 0.78. We also tested nine primer pairs for amplification in other Brassicaceae species. PCR gave detectable amplicons in more than half of the SSR markers tested in the Brassica species though their sizes were often different from those in radish (Table 4).

Linkage mapping of the radish SSRs
The present SSRs were tested for a mapping study. Of the 80 radish SSRs tested, 23 markers were successfully localized on the linkage map (Fig. 1, arrows), of which 21 were ones developed here (Fig. 1, bold types). Finally, the present map was constructed with the 336 loci (278 AFLPs, 23 radish SSRs, 34 B. rapa SSRs and 1 radish CAPS, see legend of Fig. 1 for marker nomenclatures), whereas only seven loci (4 AFLPs, 1 radish SSR and 2 B. rapa SSRs) were unmapped. This map spanned 672.7 cM with nine LGs, which are expected from the chromosome number of radish. The length of the LGs ranged from 35.6 to 122.4 cM, which contained from 22 to 56 markers, respectively, with an average map interval of 2.0 cM. The mapped SSR markers were distributed throughout the LGs.

Discussion
The present study seems to be successful in the SSR-enrichment from the radish genomes, judging from the efficiencies of SSR-enrichment as compared with those in the previous studies using cucumber (Fukino et al. 2008), Vaccinium (Hirai et al. 2010) and water lotus (Kubo et al. 2009). We have used three DNA materials (two radish lines and their F1 hybrid) for the SSR development. There was no obvious difference among the three with regard to the SSR-enrichment efficiency and the polymorphisms of markers (Table 2). Out of the 293 primer pairs initially designed for genomic SSR markers, 156 primer pairs succeeded in PCR amplifying clear bands (53.2%), whereas 81 pairs produced faint, smear or multiple bands (27.6%) (Supplemental Table 1). The rest of 56 pairs resulted in no amplification (19.1%). One of the reasons for failure in the PCR amplification could be due to the presence of repetitive DNA sequences or similar sequences in other genomic regions, as observed in marker development from species with large genomes (Song et al. 2005). The unsuccessful markers might be converted into useful markers by re-designing the primer pairs based on the nucleotide sequences flanked by the SSR repeats (Supplemental Table 1, accession nos.). The success rate of the PCR amplification in the EST-SSRs (80.6%) was higher than that in the genomic SSRs (53.2%). Similar observation has been reported in different crops such as coffee and common bean (e.g. Aggarwal et al. 2007, Blair et al. 2006). This could be because exon-derived sequences are more conservative than the intergenic regions. In spite of such the conservative nature of ESTs, some of the EST-derived SSRs were failed in stable amplification. This could be because some primer sites may have been designed across splicing sites or because of chimerical origins of the cDNA clones in the database, as discussed by Tsukazaki et al. (2010). Although polymorphism of EST-SSRs is generally lower than that of genomic SSRs (Blair et al. 2006) because of the conservative nature of exon sequences, no obvious difference was found in polymorphism rate between the genomic and EST-SSRs as long as comparison of the present two radish lines.

We previously applied B. rapa SSRs (Suwabe et al. 2002, 2006) to the radish mapping studies (Tsuro et al. 2005, 2008). In the present study, we showed that the inverse case was also effective in part. More than half of the tested radish SSRs clearly detected alleles in four lines of the Brassicaceae genera in addition to the radish cultivars (Table 4), suggesting the effectiveness of the radish SSRs across the Brassicaceae genera. The PIC values obtained in this study (average = 0.78) were comparable to those of Brassica species (Suwabe et al. 2002). Although limited numbers of SSRs were tested in this allele analysis as a test case, we confirmed that the radish SSRs developed in the previous and the present studies were applicable to the genetic diversity study in a wild radish (Ohsako et al. 2010) and Japanese radish landraces (data not shown). Therefore, the SSRs developed here would be informative at the level of within-species variation, and may be useful even in other Brassicaceae species.

Another aspect of usage of SSRs is for mapping study. We were able to map approximately one third of the applied SSRs on the radish map (Fig. 1, arrows). This ratio was similar to those of the mapping studies in Brassica species (Cheng et al. 2009, Kim et al. 2009, Li et al. 2011). Because the present map was integrated to the radish chromosome number (n = 9), the map location of radish-specific SSRs would be useful for comparison of the radish linkage maps in the previous and future studies. Further mapping of the radish SSRs will enable us to construct a denser, SSR-based radish map and to detect agronomically important loci. However, this is beyond scope of the present study that focused on the development of hundreds of radish SSRs and their evaluation. In conclusion, the radish SSRs developed here would provide the useful tools for genetic analysis in radish and its related species.
