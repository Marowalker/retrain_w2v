International potato research communities have individualized research and development journals, and provide relevant information proactively by the societies, such as Potato Research by the European Association for Potato Research (EAPR, www.eapr.net) under EUCARPIA and the American Journal of Potato Research by the Potato Association of America (PAA, http://potatoassociation.org), however, a wide range of plant science audiences would be interested in the present status of potato breeding, genetics and associated modern science topics as an integrated review. Also EAPR and PAA members are likely to read and quote topics such as biotechnology applications and their base plant science knowledge, which Japanese research communities have international competitiveness. Japanese potato communities have their own integrated information in Japanese, but no effort has been made to introduce proactively Japanese potato research communities in English. While a close collaborative link and communication have been set up on Japanese potato breeding and industry at the nation-wide level, an amalgamation with the knowledge and efforts from plant science disciplines such as plant physiology, pathology and biotechnology, would make a contribution for giving examples towards further innovative applications for breeding science.

Potatoes had contributed to the civilization in Latin America and have been supporting food security globally over four hundred years after the findings on the new continents. Further it is a vital industrial crop for many nations in economic importance. Yet, there are many hurdles in potato production that may be alleviated by knowing more about potato genetics and enhancing potato breeding. This special issue shall introduce ideas of modern potato research for general plant science communities as well as potato specific groups.
