The aim of this study was to identify haplotypes across multiple environments that contribute to flowering time and maturity, with the purpose of selecting desired alleles, but maintaining a minimal impact on yield-related traits. For this purpose, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was undertaken to identify genomic regions that control days to flowering (DTF) and maturity (DTM) using a soybean association mapping panel genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Complementarily, yield-related traits were also assessed to discuss the implications for breeding strategies. To detect either stable or specific associations, the soybean cultivars (N = 141) were field-evaluated across eight tropical environments of Brazil. Seventy-two and forty associations were significant at the genome-wide level relating respectively to DTM and DTF, in two or more environments. Haplotype-based GWAS identified three haplotypes (Gm12_Hap12; Gm19_Hap42 and Gm20_Hap32) significantly co-associated with DTF, DTM and yield-related traits in single and multiple environments. These results indicate that these genomic regions may contain genes that have pleiotropic effects on time to flowering, maturity and yield-related traits, which are tightly linked with multiple other genes with high rates of linkage disequilibrium.

Introduction
Flowering, maturity and plant height are key complex traits determining soybean productivity and adaptability (Cober and Morrison 2010, Zhang et al. 2015a). Most of these traits have been studied through correlation with yield to improve the understanding of their relationship to yield components (Fox et al. 2015, Li et al. 2008a, Mansur et al. 1996). Moreover, to improve relevant agronomic traits in breeding programs, where large populations are evaluated every year, genotyping with a small number of markers would be more feasible (Schuster 2011). Consequently, it is desirable to identify molecular markers in genetically superior progenies or exotic plant introduction with favorable alleles, which should be successfully introgressed using marker assisted selection (MAS) (Fox et al. 2015).

Yield-quantitative trait loci (QTL) are often detected within the context of specific soybean breeding populations and environments, since some conditions in any given environment, geographic region or year can change the grain yield (Guzman et al. 2007, Orf et al. 1999). According to Palomeque et al. (2010), studies have identified QTLs associated with traits of interest that appear to be independent of the environment but dependent on the genetic background in which they found. The difficulty of identifying yield-QTL effective for MAS across a wide range of genetic and/or environmental contexts might be addressable by using preliminary yield trials to model target haplotypes within each context and then immediately selecting inbred lines that target genotypes in real time (Sebastian et al. 2010). Sebastian et al. (2010) demonstrated that using MAS with haplotypes to improve grain yield is possible if focused within a specific genetic and environmental context. In addition, the context-specific approach has already been adopted as a major component of MAS strategies known commercially as Accelerated Yield Technology (AYT) at Pioneer Hi-Bred International.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using individual Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) and haplotype information have been used to improve agronomical traits in soybean (Contreras-Soto et al. 2017, Hao et al. 2012, Zhang et al. 2015a). A haplotype block is a genomic region in which two or more polymorphic loci (i.e., SNP) in close proximity tend to be inherited together with high probability (Abdel-Shafy et al. 2014). These blocks are believed to be caused by recombination hotspots with extremely rare recombination within stretches of DNA, where the enclosed SNPs consequently segregate together from one generation to the next, acting as combined multi-site alleles (Greenspan and Geiger 2004). The combination of SNP alleles in a haplotype block on one chromosome covers the observed variation and can have higher linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the allele of a QTL than individual SNP alleles that are used to construct the haplotype (Abdel-Shafy et al. 2014). Furthermore, haplotype association is likely to be more powerful in the presence of LD (Garner and Slatkin 2003). Lorenz et al. (2010) used simulated phenotype data to show that the use of SNP-based haplotypes can increase power over the use of single-SNP markers in GWAS. Using haplotypes for QTL mapping could compensate for the bi-allelic limitation of SNPs, and substantially improve the efficiency of QTL mapping (Yang et al. 2011). According to Song et al. (2015), highly selfing species, such as soybean, are in many ways uniquely suitable for haplotype block mapping. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify haplotypes across multiple environments that contribute to time to flowering and maturity in tropical soybean, with the view to improve the selection of desired alleles for these traits, but with minimal impact on yield.

Material and Methods
Plant material and field evaluation
The association panel of this study consisted of 141 cultivars of tropical soybean (Supplemental Table 1), which were field evaluated in five locations that represent eight environments of Brazil: Cascavel (24°52′54.9″S 53°32′30.4″W) in the growing seasons 2012/2013, 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 (Cas12/13, Cas13/14 and Cas14/15, respectively); Palotina (24°21′06.5″S 53°45′24.9″W) in the growing season 2014/2015 (Pal14/15); Primavera do Leste (15°34′37.6″S 54°20′41.8″W) in the growing season 2012/2013 (Pri12/13), Rio Verde (17°45′49.0″S 51°01′49.3″W) in the growing season 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 (Rio13/14 and Rio14/15), and Sorriso (12°32′43.6″S 55°42′41.8″W) in the growing season 2014/2015 (Sorr14/15). These locations were chosen on the basis of their diversity of latitude and altitude. Field trials were arranged in a complete block design with two replications. Fertilizer and field management practices recommended for optimum soybean production were used according to Embrapa (2011).

Phenotypic data analysis
Seed yield (SY), 100-seed weight (SW), plant height (PH), number of days to flowering (DTF) and maturity (DTM) were measured in the 141 soybean cultivars across the eight environments. Flowering dates were recorded when 50% of plants in a plot had open flowers. DTF was measured by counting days from emergence to flowering, when approximately 50% of plants per plot had at least one open flower (R1), and DTM was measured by counting the days from planting to the date when plants had 95% of their pods dry (R8 on the scale of Fehr and Caviness 1977). Field data were analyzed on the basis of the following mixed linear model:

 yijk=μ+gi+lj+(gl)ij+bk(j)+eijk where μ is the total mean, gi is the genetic effect of the ith genotype, lj is the effect of the jth environment, (gl)ij is the interaction effect between the ith genotype and the jth environment (G × E), bk(j) is the random block effect within the jth environment, and eijk is a random error following N(0, σe2). Adjusted entry means (AEM) were calculated for each of the 141 entries (ith genotype: gi) with the LSMEANS option of MIXED procedure, and these were used as a dependent variable in the posterior association analysis. AEM (denoted as Mi) was

 Mi=μ^+g^i where μ̂ and ĝi are the generalized least-squares estimates of μ and gi, respectively. To estimate AEM for all cultivars at each of the eight environments, g was regarded as fixed and b as random, as proposed by Stich et al. (2008). The Restricted Likelihood Ratio Test (RLRT) was calculated to confirm the heterogeneity of residual variance (across environments) using the GLIMMIX procedure in SAS, according to the following:

 RLRT=2·log[L(MHV)L(MCV)] where MHV and MCV are the models with heterogeneous and common (homogenous) variances, respectively. The asymptotic distribution of the RLRT statistic is Chi-square with p degrees of freedom (RLRT~χp2), where p is the difference in the number of parameters included in the MHV and MCV models (in this case P = 7). Consequently, error variances were assumed to be heterogeneous among locations, and these were computed using the COVTEST homogeneity option, with RANDOM _residual_ statement and GROUP option in the GLIMMIX procedure (Mora et al. 2016). Analysis of Deviance (ANODEV) was conducted to evaluate the significance of the effects of the five traits across environments by using the MIXED procedure in SAS (Nelder and Wedderburn 1972). The PROC CORR procedure was used to analyze Pearson correlations among variables by environment since G × E interactions were significant. Broad-sense heritability (h2) for the five traits at each environment was estimated as the proportion of genetic variance (σg2) over the total variance (σg2+σe2), according to the formula:

 h2=σg2(σg2+σe2) Association panel, SNP genotyping and population structure
Cultivars were genotyped for 6,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina BARCSoySNP6K BeadChip, corresponding to a subset of SNPs from the SoySNP50K BeadChip (Song et al. 2013). Genotyping was conducted by Deoxi Biotechnology Ltda. ® in Aracatuba, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 3,780 SNP markers, including polymorphic and non-redundant SNPs, SNP markers with greater than 10% minor allele frequency (MAF) and missing data values lower than 25% were used for subsequent analysis, with heterozygous markers treated as missing data. Haplotype blocks were constructed using the Solid Spine method implemented in the software Haploview (Barrett et al. 2005), and have been previously reported by Contreras-Soto et al. (2017) (Supplemental Table 2). This method considers that the first and last markers in a block are in strong LD with all intermediate markers, thereby providing more robust block boundaries. A cutoff of 1% was used, meaning that if addition of a SNP to a block resulted in a recombinant allele at a frequency exceeding 1%, then that SNP was not included in the block. Then, these LD blocks were used to conduct the haplotype-based GWAS.

A Bayesian model-based method was used to infer population structure using 3,780 SNPs, implemented in the program InStruct (Gao et al. 2007). Posterior probabilities were estimated using five independent runs of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm for the numbers of genetically differentiated groups (k) varying from 2 to 10, without prior population information. The MCMC chains were run for a burn-in of 5,000, followed by 50,000 iterations. The convergence of the log likelihood was determined by the value of the Gelman-Rubin statistic. The best estimate of k was determined according to the lowest value of the average log(Likelihood) and Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) values among the simulated groups (Gao et al. 2007), as defined by Spiegelhalter et al. (2002).

 DIC=D¯+pD where D̄ is a Bayesian measure of model fit that is defined as the posterior expectation of the deviance (D̄ = Eθ/y [−2· ln f (y/θ)]) ; pD is the effective number of parameters, which measures the complexity of the model.

SNP-based GWAS
AEM of each cultivar were used to perform SNP-based and haplotype-based GWAS for SY, PH, SW, DTF and DTM. To consider the effects of population structure and genetic relatedness among the cultivars, the following unified mixed-model (Cappa et al. 2013, Yu et al. 2006) of association was employed (in matrix form):

 y=Sα+Qv+Sv+ɛ where y is a vector of adjusted phenotypic observations; α is a vector of SNP effects (fixed); v is a vector of population structure effects (fixed); u is a vector of polygene background effects (random); and ɛ is a vector of residual effects. S, Q and Z are incidence matrices for a, v, and u, respectively. According to Yu et al. (2006), the variances of u and ɛ are Var(u)=2Kσg2 and Var(ɛ)=Rσe2, respectively. K and R are the kinship and residual variance matrices, respectively. This is a structured association model (Q model), which considers the genetic structure of the association panel included in the association mixed model. The kinship coefficient matrix (K) that explains the most likely identity by state of each allele between cultivars was estimated using the program TASSEL (Bradbury et al. 2007, Endelman and Jannink 2012). Mixed linear models with Q and K by themselves and MLM considering Q + K models were also run in TASSEL (Bradbury et al. 2007, Yu et al. 2006). The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (Schwarz 1978) was used for model selection, which is defined as:

 BIC=-2·logL+p·log(n) where L is the restricted maximum likelihood for a determined model, p the number of parameters to be estimated in the model, and n the sample size. BIC values were computed using the TASSEL program following Yu et al. (2006).

Haplotype-based GWAS
Haplotype-based GWAS was performed on the basis of LD information. Haplotype-based association mapping was performed by using adjusted phenotypes (y) as the dependent traits and the information of haplotype blocks in the model, as follows:

 y=1n+Hi+u+ei Where 1n is a vector of n ones, with n representing the number of soybean cultivars, Hi is the incidence matrix of haplotype genotypes for the individuals at the i-th haplotype locus; The element of Hi(Hij) is equal to the number of the i-th copies of haplotypes-blocks carried by the j-th cultivar. For this analysis u represents the polygenic gene effect or kinship matrix (K) with variance Var(u)=2Kσg2 and the residual effects ei with variance Var(ɛ)=Rσe2. A limit of detection (LOD) value higher than 3 was used as the threshold P-value for haplotype-trait associations according to Hwang et al. (2014). Then, only the significant haplotypes were used to estimate the phenotypic variance explained by haplotypes. The percentage of variation explained by the haplotype-based method was calculated using a simple regression performed in TASSEL as follows:

 RLR2=1-exp[(-2n)*(log LM-log L0)] Where LR is the Likelihood Ratio; n represents the number of observations (i.e., number of soybean cultivars); logLM and logL0 are the likelihood functions of the reduced and the intercept-only models, respectively (Sun et al. 2010). The Chi-square test was performed to check phenotypic differences among haplotype blocks using the CONTRAST option of the GENMOD procedure in SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

Additionally, the genomic regions or SNPs in haplotypes blocks identified in this study were compared to the genomic locations of QTLs previously reported for the traits under study. Genes, QTLs and markers annotated in Glyma1.01 and NCBI RefSeq gene models in SoyBase (www.soybase.org) were used as references.

Results
Phenotypic analysis, heritability and correlation between traits
Analysis of deviance indicated that the effects of genotype (G), environment (E) and their interaction (G × E) were statistically significant (χ2 > 0.01) for all traits under study (Supplemental Table 3). Highly significant differences were observed among traits and environments (Supplemental Figs. 1–5). On average, PH ranged from 38.27 cm (Rio13/14) to 103.45 cm (Cas12/13). SY and SW data ranged from 670.23 kg ha−1 (Rio13/14) to 3319.00 kg ha−1 (Cas14/15) and 11.96 g (Rio13/14) to 15.50 g (Rio14/15), respectively. As expected, DTF and DTM varied widely, ranging from 30 (Pri12/13) to 47 (Cas13/14) days, and 88 (Pri12/13) to 133 (Cas14/15) days, respectively (Table 1). The high phenotypic variability was confirmed by analysis of deviance, which revealed that all traits were severely influenced by environmental factors, showing significant G × E interaction (Supplemental Table 3). Over the eight environments, SY was moderately heritable with a value of 56%, whereas SW, DTM, PH and DTF showed high heritabilities: 81.7%, 91.7%, 93.4% and 94.6%, respectively.

Analysis of phenotypic correlation was conducted by environment since residual heterogeneity was observed among the environments and the G × E interaction was significant for all traits. In most of the environments, significant and positive phenotypic correlations were observed between SY and SW, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.15 (Pri12/13; P-value < 10−2) to 0.58 (Cas14/15; P-value < 10−4), and with no correlation between SY and SW in Pal14/15 and Sorr14/15. SY and SW showed different patterns of phenotypic correlation with DTF and DTM across environments. The same was observed among SY and SW with PH. In most of the environments, PH and SW showed negative correlations, although non-significant at the 0.05 level. However, PH, DTF and DTM were low to highly positively correlated traits, and statistically different of zero (P-value < 10−4), with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.13 for PH and DTF at Rio14/15 (P-value < 10−2) to 0.84 for DTM and DTF at Rio13/14 (P-value < 10−4) (Supplemental Table 4).

Genome-wide association across environments and traits
According to the deviance information criterion (from the posterior Bayesian clustering analysis), the most probable number of subpopulations was nine (Supplemental Fig. 6). The results based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC) consistently showed a better fit for the Q + K model over either Q or K alone (Supplemental Table 5). In total, 33, 29, 57, 72 and 40 linkage disequilibrium blocks were significantly associated with SY, SW, PH, DTM and DTF, respectively (Tables 2–6, Supplemental Tables 6–10). The haplotypes blocks explained considerable phenotypic variation: 17.6% to 96.8%, 13.6% to 33.2%, 45.2% to 99.4%, 12.7% to 59.9% and 12.9% to 42.7% for SY, SW, PH, DTM and DTF, respectively (Tables 2–6).

For SY, thirty-three haplotype blocks were effectively associated across environments. These haplotypes were identified on chromosomes 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 19, and showed uncharacterized gene annotation or were located in intergenic regions (Table 2). The haplotype region Gm12_Hap12 encompasses a genomic region of 420 kb and contain the satt568 and satt442 markers, which are related to the seed protein 28-2 and 28-3 QTLs, respectively (Liang et al. 2010, Yang et al. 2011) (Fig. 1). Interestingly, QTLs related to reproductive stage and pod maturity were located near this haplotype. The SSR marker satt192, related to seed glycitein 9-7, was found within Gm12_Hap12. The SNPs located at this chromosomal location were confirmed as an exclusive haplotype region because they were associated with seed yield at Cas14/15, which correspond to Cascavel in the growing season 2014/15.

In Cascavel (Cas14/15), the haplotypes Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_Hap12b were significantly different than haplotype Gm12_Hap12c. On average, Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_Hap12b produced 3509.0 kg ha−1 and 3354.1 kg ha−1, while haplotype Gm12_Hap12c yielded 2323.0 kg ha−1, 34% and 31% lower than the haplotypes Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_Hap12b, respectively. These haplotypes were well distributed in our association mapping panel (TAAT 32%, TAAC 45% and CGGT 23%) (Table 2).

For SW, twenty-nine haplotype blocks were significantly associated across environments and chromosomes (Table 3). Particularly, the Gm13_Hap41 was associated with one QTL related to SW, seed weight 40-1 (Rossi et al. 2013), and two QTLs for Pod maturity 20-1 and Lodging 27-6 (Li et al. 2008b, Rossi et al. 2013) (Fig. 2).

Most of the SNPs effectively associated with PH across environments were located on chromosome 19, including haplotype regions Gm19_Hap42 and Gm19_Hap43. These haplotypes were consistent across all environments. Gm19_Hap42 is a region containing the Determinate stem 1 gene (Dt1 or GmTFL1) (Cober et al. 2000), found 18.6 kb upstream of the peak SNP ss715635425, which has been previously associated with PH and days to maturity in soybean (Contreras-Soto et al. 2017, Zhang et al. 2015b). In addition, other yield QTLs have previously been identified in this region, including seed yield 11-6, and plant height 13-8 and 4-2 (Lee et al. 1996, Specht et al. 2001) (Table 4, Fig. 3). Therefore, this QTL region should be considered as a relevant QTL responsible for PH.

For PH, interesting or discriminant haplotypes were located in our association mapping panel, i.e., the haplotype Gm19_Hap43c (GCG), which was associated in most of the environments and showed significant differences with the haplotype responsible for tallest plants (Gm19_Hap43d) in Cas13/14 and Cas14/15. On average, soybean plants with this haplotype showed heights of 93.5 and 84.4 cm of height in Cas13/14 and Cas14/15, respectively, and represented 72% of the total panel (Table 4). However, in Pal14/15, the haplotype Gm19_Hap43a (ATA) was significantly different than the haplotype responsible for smaller plants (Gm19_Hap43c), and consequently produced higher seed yield plants with significant differences among the others haplotypes (Gm19_Hap43a =1848.2 kg ha−1, yielding 28% more than the mean of Pal14/15) (Tables 2, 4).

The haplotype Gm19_Hap42a should differentiate indeterminate growth type in soybean cultivars, whereas Gm19_Hap42b should differentiate determinate soybean cultivars. Gm19_Hap42b showed significant differences with the haplotype responsible for the tallest plants (Gm19_Hap42a) at environments Cas12/13, Cas13/14, Cas14/15, Pal14/15, Rio14/15 and Sorr14/15 (Table 4). Interestingly, in Pal14/15 for SY, this haplotype was not significantly different from the plants that yielded more (Table 2).

For DTM, seventy-two haplotypes were associated across six environments. Of these, forty-two were located on intergenic regions and did not contain putative genes related to DTM. Specifically, some yield loci have previously been associated at the haplotype genomic region Gm20_Hap32: seed yield 12-3 and 15-15, plant height 14-1 and 26-15, and seed weight 36-5 (Han et al. 2012, Kabelka et al. 2004, Sun et al. 2006, Yuan et al. 2002) (Table 5, Fig. 4).

For DTF, forty haplotypes were associated across six environments. Most of these were located on intergenic regions of different chromosomes and showed no relationship with genes or markers. The haplotype Gm12_Hap12 was associated with DTF in the environments Cas12/13 and Cas13/14, and, interestingly, the same haplotype was associated with SY (Tables 2, 6). Particularly, for DTF and SY, the haplotypes Gm12_Hap12a (TAAC) and Gm12_Hap12b (TAAT) showed significant differences with Gm12_Hap12c (54 and 55 days, respectively). In fact, these haplotypes showed the lowest days to flowering (precocity) (46 and 47 days, and 44 and 46 days in Cas12/13 and Cas13/14, respectively) and the highest yielding plants when compared with Gm12_Hap12c (Table 6).

Discussion
Phenotypic variation and correlation between traits
The heritability values observed in our panel indicate that much of the phenotypic variation was genetic. Heritability for SY (56%) was moderately high but smaller compared to Kim et al. 2012 (66%) and similar to Fox et al. 2015 (59%). On the other hand, the heritabilities for SW, PH, DTM and DTF were high and similar to those estimated by Hao et al. (2012) for SW and Zhang et al. (2015a) for PH, DTM and DTF. SY had a positive significant correlation with SW at six of the eight environments. Previous reports have also shown a significant positive correlation for SY and SW in soybean (Hao et al. 2012, Recker et al. 2014). For SY and PH, more positive than negative phenotypic correlations were observed. In addition, as suggested by Zhang et al. (2015a), the results based on multiple environments indicate that PH is a key factor for yield. On the other hand, most of the environments showed negative phenotypic correlations between SW and PH. However, Recker et al. (2014) showed a significant positive phenotypic correlation between these traits. At the moment, it is difficult to identify the potential relationship between these traits. Our results confirmed the inconsistent pattern of observed phenotypic correlation between seed yield and other important agronomic traits in soybean (Kim et al. 2012). The correlation among flowering-related traits with PH revealed the high phenotypic correlations between PH, DTM and DTF across multiple environments, suggesting close relationships among these traits.

Haplotype by environment interaction
The present study showed that some haplotype associations were location and year specific; however, stable haplotypes across environments was also found. According to Palomeque et al. (2010), QTLs for a specific trait are not always stable across environments and/or genetic backgrounds. The lack of validation in a different genetic background across environments could imply that these QTLs were not stable or that epistatic effects could be influencing the results. Another possibility is the presence of QTL by environment interactions, which represents a major challenge in genetic determinants of complex traits.

On the other hand, for plant height, strong and consistent genomic regions within haplotypes across environments were identified (i.e., Gm19_Hap42; Gm19_Hap43). For example, in Cascavel environments, the same haplotype region (Gm19_Hap42) was associated with plant height in the 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15 growing seasons (Cas12/13, Cas13/14 and Cas14/15), and explained most phenotypic variation (99.14%). Specifically, the haplotypes Gm19_Hap42a (AATxAA) and Gm19_Hap42b (GCCGGG) may help in marker-assisted selection of indeterminate and determinate growth habit soybean cultivars, respectively. QTLs controlling plant height are spread over all 20 chromosomes (Soybase 2016); however, this QTL region could be considered a relevant QTL responsible for PH (Contreras-Soto et al. 2017). In fact, Zhang et al. (2015b) previously reported this region as associated with PH and DTM in soybean. In soybean, stem growth habit is regulated by an epistatic interaction between two genes, Dt1 and Dt2 (Bernard 1972). The present study reported the haplotype association with the Dt1 gene (Table 4, Fig. 3), which maintains the indeterminate growth habit (dt1dt1 plants are fully determinate); however was not identified the Dt2 gene, which in the presence of Dt1, produces semideterminate plants. Additionally, our study reported a seed yield QTL in this region. As plant height is one of the major factors determining yield potential in soybean, Gm19_Hap42 (with its large effect on plant height) may also affect soybean yield substantially, as previously reported by Zhang et al. (2015b). In addition, Kato et al. (2015) suggest that the indeterminate growth habit is an advantageous characteristic in breeding for high yield of early maturing soybean varieties. The present study identified the Dt1 gene associated to plant height (indeterminate plants) and co-associated to yield QTL, suggesting that this genomic region would also be responsible for high yield in soybean; however fine-mapping and cross-validation of the genes localized near of this haplotype should be performed.

Co-associated haplotype genomic regions among yield and flowering traits
For several traits, some molecular markers located at candidate genomic regions were co-localized on the same haplotype block. The co-association of a single gene or two linked genes to multiple traits that are phenotypically related has been previously reported (Sun et al. 2013). On Chromosome 19 (haplotype Gm19_Hap42), four QTL regions for plant height, seed yield, SCN (soybean cyst nematode) and terminal flower harbored three genes related to TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family protein and a beta-fructofuranosidase insoluble isoenzyme 1-like. TFL1 is an ortholog of the Antirrhinum CENTRORADIALIS (CEN) and acts as a floral repressor by preventing the expression of LFY and AP1 (Bradley et al. 1996, Liu et al. 2010). This gene corresponds to the Dt1 locus, which controls soybean growth habit (Tian et al. 2010) and has been designated GmTFL1 (Glyma19g37890). GmTFL1 transcripts have been shown to accumulate in shoot apical meristems during early vegetative growth in both determinate and indeterminate growth habit soybeans; however, GmTFL1 transcripts are abruptly lost after flowering in determinate lines while remaining in indeterminate ones (Liu et al. 2010). Consequently, this generates the difference of main stem nodes and flowering periods between indeterminate and determinate plants. Additionally, on the same haplotype region, the SSR Sat_286 has been identified and has exhibited a high accuracy in discrimination tests for growth habit in soybean (Vicente et al. 2016).

The LOC100789709 gene on chromosome 20 (Gm20_Hap32), described as a splicing factor U2AF-associated protein, was related to DTM in soybean. This gene is a homolog of atU2AF in Arabidopsis thaliana. Wang and Brendel (2006) demonstrated that altered expression levels of atU2AF35a or atU2AF35b causes pleiotropic phenotypes in flowering time, leaf morphology, flower, and silique shape in A. thaliana; specifically, pleiotropic phenotypes have been observed in mutants and transgenic lines. Homozygous atU2AF35a T-DNA insertion plants and atU2AF35b transgenic plants showed late flowering under both long and short day conditions. In fact, the altered expression of this gene may also affect days to flowering and maturity in soybean, confirming the haplotype association with this latter trait. Additionally, in this candidate region, some loci controlling grain yield have previously been associated: seed yield 12-3 and 15-15, plant height 14-1 and 26-15, and seed weight 36-5 (Han et al. 2012, Kabelka et al. 2004, Sun et al. 2006, Yuan et al. 2002). These results suggest that the morphological correlations between yield components and time to flowering and maturity traits are related on a genetic basis, suggesting gene pleiotropy and high rates of linkage disequilibrium (Chen and Lubberstedt 2010).

On chromosome 12 the haplotype Gm12_Hap12 was significantly associated with SY, DTF and DTM traits in all environments under study. This result may suggest that this region contains a single gene that has pleiotropic effects and is tightly linked with multiple genes. Recker et al. (2014) evaluated multiple environments to show that SY and DTM are positively correlated, while SY was not significantly correlated with DTF. In the present study, variable correlation results were obtained at individual environments, e.g., for SY and DTM: r = −0.65 (at Cas14/15-Cascavel) to r = 0.39 and 0.26 (at Pri12/13-Primavera do Leste and Sorr14/15-Sorriso, respectively); For SY and DTF: r = −0.44 (at Cas12/13-Cascavel) to r = 0.46 (at Rio14/15-Rio Verde). As such, these results should be interpreted at the environment level considering that these traits exhibit QTL-by-environment interactions. In Cascavel, the haplotype Gm12_Hap12 should be used to improve yield and precocity in the current soybean program. Specifically, the haplotypes Gm12_Hap12a and Gm12_Hap12b showed significant differences from Gm12_Hap12c for DTF and SY. In fact, these haplotypes showed the lowest days to flowering (precocity) (46 and 47 days, and 44 and 46 days, respectively) and the highest yield plants when compared with Gm12_Hap12c. Furthermore, the fine mapping of such regions could help to discern the specific genetic elements controlling these traits. For instance, in this genomic region, two annotated (candidate) genes were identified (Glyma12g075600 and Glyma12g075700), which, in fact, should be validated.

Finally, the results of this study suggest that the BARCSoySNP6K BeadChip and haplotype-based genome-wide association are valuable sources of information for discovering genomic regions that control quantitative traits in soybean. This research identified useful associated markers that have not been previously reported and that were detected in multiple environments. This will facilitate assessing and validating causal genetic variation of complex quantitative traits and may eventually be used to accelerate the optimization of molecular breeding. However, as with any molecular markers, we emphasize that the identified haplotypes should be validated before large-scale use.
