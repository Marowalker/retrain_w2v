Introduction
Spikelet number per panicle (SPP, also known as SNP) is one of the predominant components of rice yield. Improving SPP can increase reproductive sink capacity and promote rice yield. SPP is a typical quantitative trait controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs), and the phenotype can be affected by epistatic interactions and environmental factors (Xing et al. 2002). Therefore, SPP is difficult to improve efficiently by traditional breeding methods.

In the last 10 years, five SPP-related genes, including GN1A, Ghd7, DEP1, WFP/IPA1 and SPIKE/NAL1, have been cloned, and the molecular mechanisms underlying SPP have been described (Ashikari et al. 2005, Fujita et al. 2013, Huang et al. 2009, Jiao et al. 2010, Miura et al. 2010, Xue et al. 2008). In addition, numerous QTLs for SPP have been identified (Balkunde et al. 2013, Fujita et al. 2012, Ikeda et al. 2010, Koide et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2009, Luo et al. 2009, Mei et al. 2006, Terao et al. 2010, Tian et al. 2006, Xing et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009). These findings have allowed for early-generation marker-assisted selection of breeding materials, to more efficiently improve rice yield (Lai et al. 2016).

SPP is associated with many morphological components of panicle architecture, including secondary branch number (SBN). SBN and SPP are positively correlated (Luo et al. 2009, Mei et al. 2006). A few studies have identified QTLs for SBN (Ando et al. 2008, Ikeda et al. 2010, Luo et al. 2009, Mei et al. 2006). Eleven QTLs were found associated with SBN in a study of two populations of reciprocal introgression lines. Among these QTLs, qSBN-9, contributed a large effect on both SBN and SPP (Mei et al. 2006). Another major QTL for SBN, qSBN1, was detected in a study of 39 chromosome segment substitution lines derived from a cross between the japonica cultivar Sasanishiki and indica cultivar Habataki. The qSBN1 from Habataki increased SPP approximately 30% (Ando et al. 2008). A total of 9 QTLs for SBN were mapped by using 265 introgression lines of common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) in the background of indica cultivar Guichao 2 (Luo et al. 2009). Three major QTLs for secondary rachis branch number (SRN; same as SBN) on chromosomes 1 and 8 were detected in an F2 segregated population derived from a cross between a japonica cultivar Koshihikari and a new plant type (NPT) cultivar NP-6 (Ikeda et al. 2010).

Tainan 13 (TN13) is a local japonica cultivar with good characteristics such as early maturing and good taste. To improve its reproductive sink capacity, marker-assisted backcrossing was used to introgress GN1A from a high-yield NPT cultivar IR65598-112-2 into TN13. GN1A is a previously cloned OsCKX2 (cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) gene affecting grain number per panicle (Ashikari et al. 2005). During the process, SPP and SBN distinctly segregated in four BC2F4 populations (homozygous for GN1A).

In the current study, one of the segregating BC2F4 populations was investigated for genetic dissection of SBN. To achieve high-resolution mapping, restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) was performed for genotyping. Genetic evidence confirmed that a QTL located on the long arm of chromosome 7 (designated qSBN7) was responsible for the SPP and SBN variations. In addition, the genetic effect of qSBN7 was validated and assessed using two backcross inbred lines (BILs) carrying different alleles. Our results suggest the potential of using the qSBN7 of IR65598-112-2 for SPP improvement and high-yield breeding in rice.

Materials and Methods
Plant materials
The breeding scheme for developing mapping populations is illustrated in Fig. 1. A BC2F2 population with the genetic background of a japonica cultivar TN13 was established by recurrent backcross breeding, with IR65598-112-2 used as a donor parent. Four BC2F2 individuals with the GN1A homozygous allele were self-pollinated to produce bulk BC2F3 seeds for phenotypic investigation. Six BC2F3 plants showing similar plant height and heading date to TN13 were self-pollinated to create six BC2F4 populations. Variations in SPP and SBN were observed in four of the six populations. One BC2F4 population (n = 800) which showed segregation of SPP, SBN, and spikelet number per primary branch (SPPB) was arbitrarily selected for subsequent analyses (Fig. 1). In this population, 92 individuals were randomly selected for evaluating of SPP, SBN, and SPPB. Totally 37 individuals, including 18 individuals showing high-SBN type (SPP > 210, SBN > 45 and SPPB > 18.5) and 19 individuals showing low-SBN type (SPP < 170, SBN < 35 and SPPB < 14.0), were used for substitution mapping by RAD-seq. An additional 166 high-SBN type individuals (SPP > 210, SBN > 45, and SPPB > 18.5) were used to construct a high-resolution map of qSBN7. Two BC2F5 BILs, BIL-Sbn/Sbn, with a homozygous qSBN7 allele of TN13, and BIL-sbn/sbn, with a homozygous qSBN7 allele of IR65598-112-2, were chosen from the same BC2F4 population based on the genotypes of two cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers, SNP2750 and SNP2962, on chromosome 7 (Table 1).

Genetic analysis
Four panicle traits, SPP, SBN, SPPB, and primary branch number (PBN), were manually counted in plants. The population for genetic analysis was grown in the experimental farm at Chiayi Branch Station, Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, in the second cropping season of 2014. Three panicles per plant were measured. Normality of the phenotypic distribution was investigated by generating the normal probability plot in R 3.0.2 (R Core Team 2013). The chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used to examine the hypothesis of segregation ratio. Pearson correlation coefficients between traits were analyzed by using R 3.0.2 (R Core Team 2013).

RAD library preparation and sequence analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of mature plants as described (Murray and Thompson 1980). For substitution mapping, two parents and 37 BC2F4 individuals (18 high-SBN type and 19 low-SBN type) were genotyped by using RAD-seq. The RAD library was constructed as described (Etter et al. 2011) with some modifications. DNA was digested by using PstI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), then ligated with the adapters containing a multiplex identifier we previously designed (Hsieh et al. 2014). DNA libraries were sequenced as 100-bp single-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq2500 at the VYM Genome Research Center in National Yang-Ming University (Taipei). Raw sequence data were de-multiplexed by using Stacks software (Catchen et al. 2013), then mapped to the Nipponbare reference genome sequences IRGSP1.0 (Kawahara et al. 2013) by using Bowtie2 software (Langmead and Salzberg 2012). SNP identification and genotype scoring involved use of Stacks package (Catchen et al. 2013). The tags from IR65598-112-2 and TN13 underwent comparative analysis to identify SNPs. To improve the accuracy of data, low-quality SNPs (read depth <6 or >5 missing data per locus) were filtered. After filtering, 2,522 SNPs were retained for the 37 BC2F4 individuals. Linkage analysis involved use of the R/qtl package (Broman et al. 2003). The SNP positions in this study are based on the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project Database release 7 (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) (Kawahara et al. 2013).

CAPS marker development
Raw RAD-seq reads for two parents were analyzed by using the “demultiplex reads”, “map reads to reference”, “variant detection” and “comparing variants” functions in CLC Genomics Workbench v.7.05 with the following parameters: mismatch cost 2, insertion cost 3, deletion cost 3, length fraction 0.9, and similarity fraction 0.97. All reads were aligned to the Nipponbare reference genome IRGSP1.0 (Kawahara et al. 2013). A total of 109 SNPs were detected between the physical positions 26.7 and 29.6 Mb on the long arm of chromosome 7. Eight SNPs, evenly distributed around the markers 87830 (29.0 bp) and 87941 (29.2 bp), were designed as CAPS markers. Primers were designed by using Primer3 (Untergrasser et al. 2012; http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/primer3/). The primer sequences for CAPS markers and corresponding annealing temperatures are in Table 1.

Genomic DNA was extracted from 166 individuals by using a simple, fast CTAB method (Murray and Thompson 1980). PCR was performed as described (Wang et al. 2014). The PCR products were separated on 2% Agrose SFR gel (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA) with the TBE buffer system and stained with ethidium bromide.

High-resolution mapping
One BC2F4 individual was genotyped with 8 CAPS markers (Table 1) to find the borders of the IR65598-112-2 introgression segment. Overall, 26 BC2F4 recombinants with a single crossover event in the interval between the markers SNP2750 and SNP2962 were self-pollinated to produce BC2F5 lines for the progeny test. Field trials for the progeny test involved three replications in the first cropping season of 2015. In each replication, 16 plants per BC2F5 line were transplanted into rows 25 cm apart with 20 cm within-row spacing. Ten individuals per BC2F5 line were visually rated as low-SBN, segregating, or high-SBN types. Moreover, six BC2F5 lines containing different recombinant breakpoints were assessed for SBN. The data were analyzed by ANOVA with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Comparisons among lines were assessed by Fisher’s least significant difference test at α = 0.05.

Phenotype evaluation of BILs
BIL-Sbn/Sbn, BIL-sbn/sbn and TN13 were grown with three replications in the experimental farm at Chiayi Branch Station, Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, in the first cropping season of 2015. A total of 6 agronomic traits, including plant height (PH), panicle number per plant (PN), SPP, PBN, SBN, and SPPB were evaluated at maturity. For each line, 5 individuals from the middle of a row were chosen for phenotyping. Panicles in the tallest tillers were harvested and measured. The data for each trait were analyzed by ANOVA. Comparisons among lines were assessed by Fisher’s least significant difference test at α = 0.05.

To evaluate the effect of qSBN7 on grain traits, BIL-Sbn/Sbn and BIL-sbn/sbn were grown with three replications, 52 plants (in 2 rows) per line per replication, in the experimental farm at Chiayi Branch Station, Tainan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station in the second cropping season of 2016. Traits including 1,000-grain weight (TGW), ripened grain ratio (RGR), and chalky grain ratio (CGR) were evaluated at maturity. For each line, 10 individuals were randomly chosen for measurement. Differences between lines were analyzed by Student’s t test at α = 0.05.

Results
Phenotypic variation and genetic analysis of SBN
Ninety-two BC2F4 individuals among one segregation population were evaluated for four panicle traits, including SPP, PBN, SBN and SPPB. The frequency distribution of PBN exhibited a normal distribution. The frequency distributions of SPP, SBN and SPPB exhibited discontinuous variations (Fig. 2, Supplemental Fig. 1). The 92 BC2F4 individuals were classified into low- and high-SBN type subgroups, with separation of SPP, SBN and SPPB at 210–230, 45–50, and 18.5–20.0, respectively. The ratio of number of individuals in the low- and high-SBN subgroups was 3:1 (χ21,0.05 = 0.93 < 3.84). Furthermore, significant positive correlations between SPP and SBN, SPP and SPPB, and SPPB and SBN were found. PBN was not correlated with SPP and SBN (Table 2). The results suggested that SPP, SBN and SPPB may be controlled by a single locus and the high-SBN phenotype may have a recessive pattern of inheritance.

Substitution mapping by RAD-seq
Trait-marker association was conducted to examine 17 low-SBN and 18 high-SBN BC2F4 individuals. RAD-seq resulted in ~1.23 × 108 single-end reads, from which 2,522 valid SNP markers were obtained for two parents and 37 BC2F4 individuals. Among these individuals, six chromosome intervals, including 1L (markers 12382–12807; 39.6–40.3 Mb), 4S (marker 58649; 6.7 Mb), 9S-1 (marker 100074; 1.2 Mb), 9S-2 (markers 105417–105650; 4.3–5.1 Mb), 9L (markers 106710–106787; 9.4–9.7 Mb) and 11L (markers 116181–116251; 18.2–18.4 Mb), exhibited homozygous substituted segments of IR65598-112-2; three chromosome intervals, 2L (markers 26476–26797; 32.0–32.6 Mb), 3S (marker 44580; 5.1 Mb) and 7L (markers 87830–87941; 29.0–29.2 Mp), showed segregating genotypes of IR65598-112-2 and TN13; and the remaining chromosome intervals were homozygous for TN13 (Fig. 3A). Linkage analysis using 18 high-SBN individuals and the markers targeting the three segregating segments (2L, 3S and 7L) revealed only one chromosome interval, 7L (markers 87830–87941; 29.0–29.2 Mb), co-segregating with the SBN phenotype (Fig. 3B). The SBN-associated locus on the long arm of chromosome 7 was designated qSBN7.

High-resolution mapping of qSBN7
To confirm the borders of the IR65598-112-2 introgression segment on chromosome 7, a BC2F4 individual with high-SBN phenotype was genotyped by using 8 additional CAPS markers that locate downstream of the marker 86544 (26.7 Mb) (Table 1). The markers SNP2750 (27,504,237 bp) and SNP2962 (29,627,810 bp) were identified to be the polymorphic markers closest to either end of the IR65598-112-2 introgression segments (Fig. 4A). Genotyping 166 high-SBN type plants (BC2F4) with SNP2750 and SNP2962 identified 26 recombinants, which were further genotyped with 6 additional CAPS markers in the interval. These BC2F4 recombinants were classified into 6 groups (A–F groups) based on the positions of recombination breakpoints (Fig. 4B). According to progeny test using BC2F5 lines, all groups showed a high-SBN phenotype. The A, B, C and D groups placed the qSBN7 locus to a region upstream of SNP2962, SNP2906, SNP2855 and SNP2849, respectively. The E and F groups located qSBN7 to a region downstream of SNP2788 and SNP2750, respectively. Thus, qSBN7 was located within a region of 601.4 kb between the markers SNP2788 (27,889,190 bp) and SNP2849 (28,490,603 bp) (Fig. 4B).

Phenotype evaluation of BILs for qSBN7
To characterize the effect of qSBN7, agronomic traits of BIL-sbn/sbn and BIL-Sbn/Sbn were compared (Table 3, Supplemental Table 1). For panicle traits, no significant difference in PN or PBN was observed between the two BILs. Nevertheless, values for PH, SPP, SBN and SPPB were significantly higher for BIL-sbn/sbn than BIL-Sbn/Sbn (Table 3). Compared to BIL-Sbn/Sbn, BIL-sbn/sbn showed an 83.2% increase in SPP and a 61.0% increase in SBN (Fig. 5). Moreover, SPP and SBN values were significantly higher for BIL-Sbn/Sbn than TN13 perhaps because of different alleles of GN1A in IR65598-112-2 and TN13. For grain traits, BIL-sbn/sbn showed significantly lower TGW and RGR values. No significant difference was observed for CGR (Supplemental Table 1).

Discussion
An increase in productivity has been one of the principal goals in rice breeding. Many major QTLs for yield-related traits have been identified and used for developing high-yield rice (Miura et al. 2011). At the beginning of this study, we aimed to alter SPP in a japonica cultivar, TN13, by using marker-assisted backcrossing. The GN1A allele of IR65598-112-2 was introgressed into TN13. Of note, four BC2F4 populations with a homozygous GN1A allele of IR65598-112-2 showed segregation of SPP and SBN, which suggested the existence of another QTL(s) controlling SPP and SBN. The donor parent, IR65598-112-2, is an NPT rice cultivar with low tiller number, high SPP, high SBN, and strong culms (Khush and Peng 1996). The phenotypes of IR65598-112-2 are similar to plants with the IPA1/WFP allele at OsSPL14. High expression of OsSPL14 in the reproductive stage promotes panicle branching and grain yield in rice (Jiao et al. 2010, Miura et al. 2010). OsSPL14 was not considered a causative QTL in our materials, because among F2 individuals derived from the cross of IR65598-112-2 and TN13, there was no significant association detected between SPP/SBN and an OsSPL14-linked marker (data not shown).

The current study located a novel QTL for SBN (qSBN7) at a region between 27.9–28.5 Mb on chromosome 7, and the SBN trait was completely co-segregated with the markers SNP2830 and SNP2835. Although several QTLs for SBN have been identified (Ando et al. 2008, Ikeda et al. 2010, Luo et al. 2009, Mei et al. 2006), none was localized to the same region of qSBN7. A major QTL, qTSN7.1, for total spikelet number per panicle (TSN) (Koide et al. 2013), located close to qSBN7 and resembled the gene effect of qSBN7. However, its position on chromosome 7 (24.0–26.0 Mb) (Koide et al. 2013) is different from that of qSBN7 (27.9–28.5 Mb). It is worth noting that a pleiotropic QTL, qGL7, was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7 (28.2–28.5 Mb) (Bai et al. 2010), which shares a small overlapping region with qSBN7. As a major QTL for grain size, qGL7 simultaneously affects grain weight, length, width, thickness, and spikelet number per panicle (Bai et al. 2010). The qSBN7 allele of IR65598-112-2 increased SBN and SPP and also reduced TGW and RGR. Whether qGL7 and qSBN7 are identical, allelic, or linked remains to be resolved.

qSBN7 is a pleiotropic QTL affecting multiple panicle traits. The homozygous IR65598-112-2 allele at qSBN7 significantly improved PH, SPP and SBN in the genetic background of TN13. High SPP potentially enhances the reproductive sink capacity of rice. Several SPP-related genes and QTLs have been identified (Ashikari et al. 2005, Fujita et al. 2013, Huang et al. 2009, Jiao et al. 2010, Miura et al. 2010, Xue et al. 2008). Previous studies indicated that favorable alleles at two SPP-related genes, GN1A and SPIKE/NAL1, found widely in modern rice varieties, could improve rice grain yield (Wang et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2009). GN1A is a major gene encoding OsCKX2. The nearly isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Habataki allele at GN1A in the Koshihikari genetic background showed a 20.7% increase in grain number per panicle (Ashikari et al. 2005). SPIKE/NAL1 has pleiotropic effects on several components of plant architecture. The NIL carrying the IR68522-10-2-2 allele at SPIKE/NAL1 achieved a 13% to 36% increase in yield (Fujita et al. 2013). This study revealed a newly discovered and fine-mapped SPP/SBN-related QTL, qSBN7, for high-sink capacity breeding in rice. Because qSBN7 has a similar effect as GN1A and SPIKE/NAL1 and it negatively affected TGW and RGR, the sink–source balance should be considered when pyramiding qSBN7 with other SPP- and grain-filling-related genes. In addition, the phenotype of SPP is easily affected by genetic and environmental factors (Xing et al. 2002). To facilitate the use of qSBN7 in rice breeding, future work should focus on understanding the effect of qSBN7 in diverse genetic backgrounds and/or environments.
