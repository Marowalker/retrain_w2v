Sweetpotato is the seventh most important food crop in the world after maize, rice, wheat, potatoes, cassava, and barley. Although it originated in Central to South America, Asia is now the largest producing region with three quarters of the world’s annual production. Sweetpotato can withstand poor growing conditions, such as low soil nutrients and periodic drought, and can accumulate starches into the roots during much of the growing period enabling high and stable yields. Sweetpotato is an important starch resource for human food and industrial use, but it also serves as valuable dietary sources of beta-carotene, the precursor to Vitamin A, and minerals. Additionally, the storage root of purple-fleshed sweetpotato accumulates anthocyanins, which have antioxidant properties and possibly cancer prevention and health promotion effects.

Sweetpotato is an out-crossing hexaploid species with a relatively large genome size. These genetic backgrounds of sweetpotato have been limiting genetic analysis and applications of modern breeding strategies. However, the recent technological developments of genetic analysis and biotechnology are opening the way to overcome such difficulties in sweetpotato genetics. These developments include rapid sequencing technology, transcriptomics, transformation system, gene cloning, and applications of these technologies.

Since sweetpotato is important not only as a food resource in Asia, but also as a functional food and for industrial use, trilateral cooperation of sweetpotato research has been conducted over 14 years among research institutes and universities in Japan, Korea, and China.

This special issue will review the latest research findings mainly made by the research institutes and universities in these three countries. This issue will introduce recent progress in sweetpotato breeding activities, including programs for diverse industrial uses and pest resistance in Japan. Biochemistry and genetic controls over carbohydrate and functional components in storage root are also reviewed. This issue includes gene engineering for stress tolerance and other important traits, and metabolic engineering of carotenoids in sweetpotato. Genetic linkage analysis and genome sequence activities are also included where various examples of recent research for genome sequencing of sweetpotato are introduced.

According to CIP, sweetpotato is a cheap, nutritious solution for developing countries (CIP 2017). CIP operates a special 10-year project to improve the food security of 10 million households across 17 Sub-Saharan Africa countries by exploiting the potential of sweetpotato. It is hoped that the achievement of the trilateral sweetpotato research represented by this special issue may contribute to the breeding activities of the world’s sweetpotato production including Africa.
