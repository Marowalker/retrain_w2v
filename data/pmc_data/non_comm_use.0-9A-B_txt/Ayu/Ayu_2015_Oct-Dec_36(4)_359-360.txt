The field of Ayurveda has witnessed tremendous metamorphosis over the ages. A science that was in the confinement of several things has basked in its glory and heading towards globalization. The journey from primordial to globalization, manuscripts to monographs, and principles to parameters has been immense. The cognizance of Ayurveda is a linchpin to the health benefits that it has to offer the humankind. The development in Ayurveda has come a long way and it is quite admirable. It has primed itself to take away a flight, but there is just the need of a thrust to gain newer heights. Development in Ayurveda seeks perseverance and dedication. Ayurveda science has been discovered for prevention as well as curing of diseases. To fulfill this aim, there are several processes and measures that have to be undertaken.

The developmental areas in Ayurveda can be thought of as in three areas, viz., academics, clinical practice, and researches. There is a need to strive hard to set up impeccable standards in all these three fields. After all, what we seek is overall development in all the fields for the progress of Ayurveda. The acceptance and identity of Ayurveda can be sought by adopting new standards that are in sync with the present era to face the challenges and overcome the problems that haunt the century.

There is a quandary whenever clinical practice of Ayurveda is concerned. This shows up in the meager amount of students who practice Ayurveda successfully in comparison to a large number of Ayurveda graduates in the country. It is imperative to know the rules of a game and combine it with hard work and practice to be on the winning end. To be a successful Ayurveda practitioner, you have to know the principles of Ayurveda profoundly and then strive towards their application and practice them for better outcome. The problem area lies in the roots. Most of the students are unable to understand the complexities of the subject related to its language or concepts. Several reasons can be attributed towards it such as inability of teachers to teach and make the students understand the subject, loss of interest among the students toward the subject, and treating the subject with contempt or disrespect. It is a great responsibility vested upon the shoulders of a teacher to put across the concepts with clarity and develop an interest and confidence among them that they can have faith in this field and come out with flying colors. Often students find themselves lost in a dilemma whether to practice Ayurveda or not. First and foremost, there is a need of good academicians who can commence and accentuate the process of learning to the students who are a complete novice to the field of Ayurveda, and just when understanding among the students gains momentum, there is a need to also maintain a stability without a fall in it. It is also the responsibility of the students to have trust in the science and the teachers.

Researches in Ayurveda are something that have to be taken up seriously. It is propitious to customize the developmental process according to the need of the present era. However, imitating the modern sciences completely and compromising with the gist of Ayurveda is not acceptable. There is a need to adapt the necessary changes without replacing the old concepts. Research is not always about inventing something new, but it is also about discovering the old concepts. There is a need to define and set the standards of research according to the norms of Ayurveda.

Another important thing is “Evidence-based medicine” which has become like a catchphrase and needs an extensive and scientific thought process. It would really be a revolution if we would be capable enough to present and define the concepts of Ayurveda on the grounds of this “evidence-based medicine.” Coupling technology with the concepts and putting them into application can definitely pave the way of development in the field of Ayurveda. Ayurveda will be embraced with open arms once the whole world is convinced about its authenticity and efficacy. Globalization of Ayurveda is not something that we have to pursue. Brilliance and excellence in work, efforts of high caliber perceived with utmost sincerity and integrity will inevitably bring it to the notice of the entire world eventually achieving globalization of Ayurveda. We just have to devote ourselves to excel in all these three fields and the rest of the things will follow. A change in perspective will transform the present scenario.

If we can foresee the challenges in Ayurveda, it is also possible to conceive a plausible plan of action to overcome the challenges. This is a duty and a great responsibility that is vested on the shoulders of all of the aspirants of Ayurveda. Acharya Charaka has mentioned that giving away the demerits and implementing the best methods gradually can certainly help in uprooting the problem and providing a solution.[1] We just need to have the patience and discipline excluding the clouds of doubt and everything will fall into its place automatically. Taking all these things into consideration, a full proof system in Ayurveda can definitely successfully headway in Ayurveda and reach its destination to flourish it as an integral part of medicine availing its benefit to the entire mankind.

Consistency and faith in the science are the key principles to prove its accountability. Ayurveda is truly the science of life. It imparts us with the health benefits as well as teaches us the moral values to lead a content and happy life. It is our duty to practice the principles of Ayurveda in our lives and then set an example to the rest of the world. Peace of mind is derived not from the external world but with the serenity of the inner self. Once the self is convinced about the authenticity of this science, it will take no time to prosper and propagate the science of Ayurveda. Everyone should first analyze their own self to adhere and understand this divine science of life. Needless to say than that the journey of life will be beautiful and a memorable one.
