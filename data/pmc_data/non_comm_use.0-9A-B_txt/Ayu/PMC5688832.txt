The Ayurvedic approach toward the treatment of Amavata is the need of present era as no system is successful in providing the complete cure to this disease. Amavata is a challenging and a burning problem of medical science. Prevalence of RA is approximately 0.8% of the population. Due to wide spectrum of disease, much prevalence in the society, and lack of effective medicine, the disease had been chosen for the study. The aim of the research was to study the efficacy of Alambushadi Ghana Vati and Vaitarana Basti in the management of Amavata (RA). It was a single-center, randomized, open-clinical study. In the present study, 30 clinically diagnosed patients of Amavata were selected and randomly divided into two groups by lottery method. Alambushadi Ghana Vati was given in dose of two tablets (each 500 mg) three times in a day with lukewarm water after meal for 30 days, while Vaitarana Basti on alternate day (15 Basti) had been given simultaneously in the second group along with drug of first group. Statistical analysis was done using InStat GraphPad 3 Software. Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test was used for the analysis of nonparametric data, while paired t-test was used for parametric data analysis and Mann–Whitney test and unpaired t-test were used for intergroup comparison. Statistically highly significant (HS) improvement was found in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and HS results were found in symptoms of Amavata when the Vaitarana Basti was used along with Alambushadi Ghana Vati. With excellent relief in 20% patients, significant relief in 60% patients, moderate relief in 13.33% patients, whereas mild relief in 6.66% patients. On comparing the effect of two therapies, it can be concluded that Group B (Alambushadi Ghana Vati and Vaitarana Basti) provided better relief than Group A (Alambushadi Ghana Vati) in most of the sign and symptom of the disease at significant level.

Introduction
In the present era, due to modern life style, hectic work schedule, stress, and many such reasons, incidence of disease is increasing, and one of them is Amavata, which can be compared with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) due to its clinical presentation. The disease is being chosen for the study due to its widespread clinical spectrum, increased prevalence, and lack of effective medicaments. Prevalence of the disease is approximately 0.8% of the population and about 80% of people develop this disease between the age of 35 and 50 years.[1]

According to the nature of disease, it is essential to plan such therapy which has Ama and Vatahara properties. The line of treatment described for the disease in Chakradatta Amavatachikisa Prakarana includes Langhana, Swedana use of Tikta and Katu drugs and if needed Virechana and Basti.[2] This study has been under taken to evaluate role of Shamana drug along with Shodhana therapy (Virechana Basti). Hence, in the present study, “Alambushadi Ghana Vati” has been selected as Shamana Yoga while “Vaitarana Basti” has been selected for study as Samshodhana process.

Aims and Objectives

Clinical evaluation of efficacy of Alambushadi Ghana Vati and Vaitarana Basti in the management of Amavata (RA).




Materials and Methods
Selection of patient
Thirty patients of Amavata were selected from Kayachikitsa OPD and IPD of National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur. The case selection was regardless of age, sex, occupation and socio-economic conditions. Both acute and chronic phases of Amavata patients were taken for the study, following the ACR criteria of the diagnosis of RA in modern medicine and the clinical features of Amavata described in Madhava Nidana.[3]

Study design
Present study is single center, open labeled randomized (lottery method) clinical trial.

Patients contraindicated for Basti as mentioned in Samhitas.




Grouping
A total of 30 clinically diagnosed and registered patients of Amavata were divided randomly by lottery method into two groups. Each group had 15 patients.


Group A: 15 clinically diagnosed patients of Amavata were treated with Alambushadi Ghana Vati two tablets (each 500 mg) three times in a day with lukewarm water after meal for 30 days.




Group B: 15 clinically diagnosed patients of Amavata were treated with Alambushadi Ghana Vati two tablets (each 500 mg) three times in a day with lukewarm water after meal for 30 days along with Vaitarana Basti which was given on alternate day (15 Basti) simultaneously. Vaitarana Basti (approximately 200–250 ml), after the meal and Anuvasana Basti (approximately 60–80 ml), after the meal (It was given only to the patients who presented with symptoms of Vata aggravation. It consisted of Tila Taila and one pinch of Saindhava mixed well. It was given in the dose of 60–80 ml whenever the patients developed Vata Vriddhi Lakshana while receiving Vaitarana Basti.

Drugs and method of its preparation

Miers), Trivrutta (Operculina turpethum Linn.) in the proportion of 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:28. Alambushadi Ghana Vati was made of 500 mg each Vati. The materials were procured and prepared in GMP certified pharmacy of the institute (Drug Batch No. A0281).

Ingredients of Vaitarana Basti
Amalika
(Emali) (Tamarindus indica Linn.), Guda, Saindhava, Gomutra, and Tila Taila (Sesamum indicum Linn.) in the proportion of 4:2:1:16.

Preparation of Vaitarana Basti
Initially, 20 g (1 Shukti) of jaggery (Guda) was mixed uniformly with equal quantity of lukewarm water and 10 g (1 Karsha) of Saindhava was added. Thereafter, Tila Taila was added till the mixture become homogenous (approximately 30 ml). To this 40 g (1 Pala) of Emali Kalka was added carefully and then finally, 160 ml (1 Kudava) of Gomutra was added slowly and mixing untill uniform Basti Dravya was obtained. That was then filtered and Basti Dravya was made lukewarm by keeping it into hot water. Basti was given by proper method in the left lateral position by Basti Yantra, after meals in morning hours.

Criteria for assessment

Investigations
For the assessment of effect of therapy and to rule out side effect if any, following investigation were done:


Hematological- Hb gm%, total leukocytes count (TLC), differential leukocyte count (DLC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum. uric acid, fasting blood sugar level (FBS), RA factor, C-reactive protein (CRP) test, antistreptolysin O (ASLO) titer

Urine routine/microscopic

Radiological X-ray of affected joints.




In this study, serum uric acid was done to exclude Gout which mimic the RA symptoms and random blood sugar level (RBS) was used for screening patients of diabetes.

Observation
Present study had shown that 50% patients belong to the 3rd to 5th decade of life and were formal. Incidence of disease is notably higher in females (73.33%) than in males (26.67%), i.e., (2.7:1) Majority of the patients (76.67%) belonged to Hindu religion; 80% patients were married. Out of which, maximum 50% patients were housewives, followed by 26.67% laborers; about 50% patients belonged to middle class. 46.67% patients were of Vata-Kaphaja Prakriti, 56.67% patients were of Madhyama Sara, 43.33% had Madhyama Samhanana, 56% patients with Madhyama Satmya, 64% patients with Madhyama Satva, 53.33% patients showed Madhyama Ahara Shakti, 53.33% patients showed Avara Vyayamashakti, 50% patients had Madhyama Koshtha, whereas 40% patients had Krura Koshtha and maximum 60% patients had Mandagni. In this type of Koshtha and Agni, there is predominance of Vata and Kapha Dosha, which may play important role in developing the pathogenesis of Amavata.

Discussion
Ingredients of Alambushadi Ghana Vati are Alambhusha (Lajjalu), Gokshur, Haritaki, Bibhitaki, Amalaki, Shunthi, Amrita, Trivrutta in the proportion of 1:2:3:4:5:6:7:28, i.e., having highest concentration of Trivrutta with their Kapha Vata Shamaka and Virechana properties thus[5] help in reducing the swelling in the joints.

Also, Katu, Tikta Rasa is dominant in this formulation, thus help in digestion of Ama and finally in breakage of pathogenesis of disease. Besides this, there is dominancy of Laghu, Ruksha Gunas in the Alambushadi Ghana Vati which also helps in Kaphaghna property. Five Dravyas out of eight in the formulation possesses Laghu and Ruksha Guna. This formulation also dominance of drugs Ushna Virya which also helps to pacify the Vata Dosha. In addition of six Dravyas with Shothahara and Anulomana property are also present. With these overall effect of these properties of the drugs of Alambushadi Ghana Vati, Ama and Vata Dosha is treated and thus relief in the cardinal symptoms of the disease was found.

Guduchi is also proved to have antirheumatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties.[6] While, Sunthi is also proved beneficial for rheumatic and musculoskelatal disorders.[7]Triphala has Rasayana, Tridoshahara, and Virechana properties[8] which helps in reducing the swelling in the joints. Gokshura with its diuretic properties helps to reduce swelling in the joints.[9]

Probable mode of action of Vaitarana Basti
Vaitarana Basti has been mentioned by Chakradutta in Niruhadhikar 73/32. Ingredients of Vaitarana Basti are Amalika
(Emali), Guda, Saindhava, Gomutra and Tila taila in the proportion of 4:2:1:16. As a whole, the qualities of Vaitarana Basti can be considered as Laghu, Ruksha, Ushna, Tikshna. Majority of the drugs have Vata Kapha Shamaka action. Owing to these properties treatment with the Basti has provided significant improvement in sign and symptom of disease. The Tikshna Guna of Basti helps in overcoming the Srotodushti resulting due to Sanga, thus help in breaking down the pathogenesis of disease.

Basti therapy may be stimulator for many intraluminal, luminal, and whole body functions. Basti Karma exerts a more systemic action besides exerting local action of operating through large intestine involving enteric nervous system. Enteric nervous system is a collection of neurons in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) constituting the brain of gut. Apart from its influence on GIT, enteric nervous system also influences the autonomic nervous system thereby producing systemic affect.[10]

Vata is very important Dosha to be managed during treatment of any disease as Acharya told that other Doshas are handicapped without Vata Dosha, and Basti is very important therapy to manage Vata Dosha, and is called as Ardha Chikitsa.[11]

As a whole, the effect of Basti can be summarized as encolonic (action on tissue of colon), endcolonic (action inside colon), and diacolonic (for systemic action). Thus, Basti Dravya after reaching to large and small intestine get absorbed from intestine and due to Laghu, Ushna, Tikshna, and Ruksha Guna of Vaitarana Basti Dravya, it breaks the obstructions and expels out the morbid material from all over the body, thus help in breaking down the pathogenesis of disease.

General observation made during the trial

During the trial, it was observed that in Vata Pittaja Prakriti patients, there was less holding capacity of the Basti Dravya. In these patients, the dose of Gomutra was lowered along with overall Basti quantity to seek the expected results

As Ayurveda is individualized science (Ch. Su. 1/24), every individual has different sensitivity for different contents of formulation, hence cases abdominal discomfort was reported in few cases which was managed by reduction in total quantity of the Basti

Just after Samyaka Basti Nirharana, patient felt very light and enthusiastic.




Conclusion
Finally, comparing the effect of two therapies, it can be concluded that (Alambushadi Ghana Vati along with Vaitarana Basti) provided better relief than (Alambushadi Ghana Vati alone) in most of the signs and symptoms of the disease at significant level.
