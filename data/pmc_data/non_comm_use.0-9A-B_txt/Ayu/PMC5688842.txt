Pregnant women are more prone to vulvovaginitis which is a great challenge for obstetricians today. In Ayurveda, Upapluta Yonivyapad described by Acharya Charaka, Sharangadhara, and both Vagbhata can be compared to vulvovaginitis during pregnancy.

Aims:
The present study aimed to evaluate efficacy of Dhatakyadi Varti in the management of Upapluta Yonivyapad (vulvovaginitis during pregnancy).

Materials and Methods:
A total of 80 female patients in the age group of 19–40 years were registered and divided into two groups. In Group A (n = 46), Dhatakyadi Varti was inserted intravaginally, and in Group B (n = 34), Clingen vaginal suppository was inserted intravaginally once at bed time for 14 days. The effect of therapy was assessed on the basis of relief in subjective and objective criteria, i.e., vaginal smear test.

Results:
In subjective parameters, such as Yoni Srava, Yoni Kandu, Yoni Vedana, Yoni Daha and Yoni Daurgandhya, better result was observed in trial Group A receiving Dhatakyadi Varti. Highly significant relief (P < 0.001) was observed in fungal infection, and significant relief (P = 0.005) was observed in Gram - negative bacterial infection and pus cells in Group A. In Group A, 34.88% patients had complete remission, marked improvement was found in 34.88% cases, and only 2.32% patients remained unchanged, while in Group B, 33.33% patients reported complete remission, marked improvement was found in 10% cases, and 20% patients remained unchanged.

Conclusion:
It was concluded from the clinical trial that Dhatakyadi Varti is highly effective in reducing subjective and objective variables of Upapluta Yonivyapad and can be introduced as a safe herbal therapy of vaginal discharge during pregnancy.

Introduction
Pregnancy is a beautiful phase in women’s life and desire to have a healthy progeny is innate and very intense in every living being. Pregnancy is associated with specific anatomical, physiological, and immunological changes that can predispose to infection and also alter the response to the disease process. Some of the infections may be serious and life-threatening for the mother, while others may seriously jeopardize the fetus or neonate leaving the mother asymptomatic. Fetal infections may develop early in pregnancy to produce obvious stigmata at birth. Alternatively, organisms may colonize and infect the fetus during labor and delivery. Infection is the most clearly recognized and more widely studied and responsible for about 20%–40% of all cases of pre-term birth and other complications such as premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and spontaneous abortion.[1] As per Acharya Sushruta, as fruits detach from tree untimely due to the effect of Krimis (parasites), Vata and Abhigata, similarly fetus also gets detached due to the influence of all these factors. Upapluta Yonivyapad has been described by Acharya Charaka, [2] both Vagbhata, [34] and Sharangadhara, [5] but only Acharya Charaka has clearly mentioned that it is a disease of a pregnant woman, and thus, it can be compared to vulvovaginitis during pregnancy. According to Acharya Charaka, when a pregnant woman consumes faulty diet or indulges in mode of life capable of vitiating Kapha and also suppresses desire of vomiting and inspiration, then vitiated Vayu withholding Kapha affects Yoni and produces abnormalities such as yellowish vaginal discharge associated with pricking pain and this condition is known as Upapluta Yonivyapad.[6]Acharya Charaka has mentioned Dhatakyadi Taila[7] for Yoni Pichu, for this disease, but in the present study, the same has been prepared in the Varti form considering that Varti Kalpana is convenient for patients as it can be administered by self without much precaution and supervision.

Hence, the clinical study was carried out with the aim to evaluate and compare the efficacy of Dhatakyadi Varti with Clingen vaginal suppository in the management of Upapluta Yonivyapad (vulvovaginitis).

Materials and Methods
Patients
In the present study, patients were selected from the outpatients Department of Stree Roga and Prasuti Tantra with positive Trichomonas vaginalis/fungal hyphae/pus cells in the vaginal smear or Gram-negative organisms in Gram staining were registered for the trial. A detailed history was taken according to the proforma specially prepared for this purpose.

Drugs
The raw drugs for Dhatakyadi Varti [Table 1] were obtained from Pharmacy of Gujarat Ayurved University and authenticated in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory of IPGT and RA. Varti was prepared in the Department of Rasashashtra and Bhaishajya Kalpana. Table 2 shows the ingredients of Dhatakyadi Varti.

Table 2 Ingredients for each Dhatakyadi Varti of 3 g

Method of preparation
Dhatakyadi Yavakuta was taken in a big container, and then eight times distilled water was added and heated till it was reduced up to ¼. Prakshepa Dravya was added into Kwatha and the solution was stirred for 5 min. Then, gelatin powder was added into mixture. Whole solution was melted in water bath and propylparaben sodium salt was added. Heat was constantly supplied and the solution was continuously stirred until a homogeneous mixture was obtained; then, it was poured into suitable chilled molds. After the drug settled, it was kept in refrigerator for 15 min and then it was packed into sterile plastic packets.

Ethical clearance
The study had a due clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee (Ref. PGT/7-A/Ethics/2013-14/1767, dated 10/09/2013) and CTRI registration was done (CTRI Number: CTRI/2015/05/005747). Before initiation of the study, informed written consent was taken from each patient. Patients were asked to withdraw their name from the study at any time without giving any reason if they wish.

Study design
For this clinical trial, an open-labeled randomized standard control interventional method was adopted.

Investigations

Routine hematological examination such as complete blood count and urine routine and microscopic examination were carried out before and after the course of treatment

Biochemical test, i.e., fasting blood sugar and serological test such as S. venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) and S. HIV were carried out in all the patients before starting the course of treatment.

Specific investigations such as vaginal pH, vaginal smear, and Gram staining tests were carried out before and after the course of treatment.




Treatment protocol
In Group A, Dhatakyadi Varti (each of 3 g) was inserted intravaginally once at bed time for 14 days, and in Group B, Clingen vaginal suppository (clotrimazole 100 mg, clindamycin 100 mg) was inserted intravaginally once at bed time for 14 days.

Criteria for assessment
Subjective criteria

The improvement in the patient was assessed on the basis of relief in the signs and symptoms of the diseases such as Yoni Srava, Yoni Kandu, Yoni Vedana, Yoni Daha and Yoni Daurgandhya and a special scoring pattern was adopted for this.




Objective criteria
Assessment of the therapy was carried out by comparing the before treatment and after treatment changes of vaginal pH, vaginal smear, and Gram staining test.

Follow up
After completion of course, patients were advised to report every 15 days for 1 month.

Assessment criteria for overall effect of therapy
If <25% changes were found in sign and symptoms of disease, then it was considered as no change in condition, like wise changes of 26%–50% were considered as mild improvement, changes of 51%–75% were considered as moderate improvement, changes of 76%–99% were considered as marked improvement, and 100% relief was considered as complete remission in disease condition.

Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon signed-rank test for nonparametric paired data, paired t-test for quantitative parametric paired data, and unpaired t-test for quantitative unpaired data were used. The results were interpreted at the level of P > 0.05 as insignificant, P < 0.05 as significant, P < 0.001 as highly significant, and P < 0.0001 as extremely highly significant.

Discussion
On the basis of all clinical features and principles of treatment, Upapluta Yonivyapad seems to be nearer to vulvovaginitis during pregnancy. Acharya Charaka has mentioned Dhatakyadi Taila for Yoni Pichu, but in this present study, the same drug has been used in the Varti form. Varti Kalpana is convenient for patients to administer by own, and there is no need of any precaution and supervision. As in modern science, vaginal suppositories are of fixed dose, to resemble that parameter vaginal suppositories were prepared.

Most of the drugs of this Yoga have Kashaya Rasa, Ruksha Guna and Kapha Dosha Shamaka properties. They have been reported as Stambhaka[89101112131415] (styptic), Garbhashayashothahara (anti-inflammatory), [9101215161718]Kandughna[161719] (antipruritic), Twagdoshahara[8916] (dermatic), Krimighna[811181920] (anthelmintic), antibacterial, [91118] antifungal, [891117] and antimicrobial[916] [Chart 1].

Chart 1 Probable mode of action of Dhatakyadi Varti

In the present study, maximum numbers of patients were from the age group of 25–30 years. This indicates that this disease is a common problem of active reproductive life.[21] Most of patients were from lower middle class; these people cannot get proper diet and hygienic environment. Hence, the chances of infection are higher in lower strata. Most of patients were of second trimester; this suggests that during second trimester, decreased immunity causes decreased local defense mechanism which is also responsible for growth of microorganism. According to Acharya Charaka, 5th month onward Garbhini becomes emaciated, suffers from loss of strength, and feels excessively exhausted.[22] Most of patients had the history of intercourse 1–2 times/week. It is mentioned in Ayurvedic classics that Atimaithuna (excessive sexual intercourse) is one of the important causative factor for all Yonivyapad and during pregnancy is prohibited by Acharyas.[2324]

Results of clinical study suggest that Dhatakyadi Varti is much more effective to treat fungal infection compared to clingen vaginal suppositories. In bacterial infection, control group shows better relief compare to Dhatakyadi Varti trial group. Recurrence rate is also low in Dhatakyadi Varti trial group, and it can definitely become effective herbal formulation to treat vulvovaginitis during pregnancy.

Conclusion
Upapluta Yonivyapad is the disease of the pregnant women which produces untowards outcomes if left untreated. Dhatakyadi Varti not only treats the disease but also normalizes the vaginal flora. It can be concluded that Dhatakyadi Varti is highly effective in reducing subjective and objective variables of Upapluta Yonivyapad (vulvovaginitis during pregnancy).
