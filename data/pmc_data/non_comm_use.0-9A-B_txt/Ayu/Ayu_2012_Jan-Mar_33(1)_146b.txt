==== Body
Thank you sir for showing interest in the article[1] and raising certain queries. Since it is a a preliminary study, only a limited number of cases have been enrolled in the current attempt.

A clinical trial with a large number of population has already been done. The observations are under the process of publication.

Regarding the scoring system; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is adopted for the trial as universal grading and scoring system consensus is difficult to find. Aseptic conditions were ascertained while manufacturing and storing the eye drops. Analysis of the trial drugs revealed that the drugs are free from microbial contaminations. Hence, they are safe to use as eye drops.[2]
