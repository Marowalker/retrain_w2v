Sir,

A recent article entitled “Effect of Majja Basti (therapeutic enema) and Asthi Shrinkhala (Cissus quadrangularis) in the management of Osteoporosis (Asthi-Majjakshaya),” which was published in this journal is quite interesting and informative.[1] The authors of this article have very well described the role of herb and its role in management of osteoporosis in their clinical trial of 12 patients. In this article, the authors have highlighted multiple in-vivo actions of Cissus quadrangularis based on existing literature. Additionally, the authors could have cited some of the recent studies on in-vitro osteoblastogenic effect of Cissus quadrangularis.[2–4] This article would have been more comprehensive if such information is also integrated in the discussion.
