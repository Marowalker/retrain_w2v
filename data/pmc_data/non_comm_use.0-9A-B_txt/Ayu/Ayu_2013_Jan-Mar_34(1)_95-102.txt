Brahmi is a well-known herbal drug having an effect on brain as a memory enhancer. Bacopa monnieri (L.) Pennel and Bacopa floribunda (R.Br.) Wettst are both marketed in the name of Brahmi. The present study differentiates Bacopa monnieri and Bacopa floribunda in morphology, transverse section (T.S.) of root and leaf, powder microscopy, and chemical constituents. Morphological characters show color difference in flower, stem and leaf and differences in microscopic study, organoleptic study, and powder characteristics. Morphologically, Bacopa monnieri leaf is fleshy and more succulent than Bacopa floribunda leaf. There is also a difference in the interval of the stem internodes of the two. Physico-chemical analysis revealed presence of 26% bacoside A in Bacopa floribunda leaf and 27% in Bacopa floribunda stem, which is higher than the bacoside A content in leaf (22%) and stem (18%) of Bacopa monnieri. However due to the hemolytic action of bacoside A, which is the toxic effect of the chemical constituent, it seems likely that Bacopa monnieri is more popular in regular use than Bacopa floribunda.

Introduction
Materia medica or Pharmacognosy, may be defined as science that aims at a complete and systematic knowledge of crude drugs of animal or vegetable origin. A complete knowledge of a drug must include knowledge of the morphological nature and the structure, both macroscopic and microscopic, with active constituents, their nature, quantification and the relation they bear to the constituents of other drugs. To attain this knowledge of chemistry and chemical methods for investigation, or at least the results of other investigations in these respects utilized, and the information thus obtained, combined to form a complete knowledge of each drug.[1] The herb Brahmi is reputed as a brain tonic for promoting memory and various mental faculties. The leaves and whole plant are used in psychological disorders, skin diseases and used as a general restorative or rejuvenating drug. The leaf juice is applied to swellings and is a good liniment for rheumatism. The juice of leaves is given to infants suffering from catarrh or severe bronchitis.[2] Two plants Bacopa monnieri and Bacopa floribunda are used in Ayurveda for Brahmi. Till date, no study has been carried out to differentiate the characters between leaf and stem of both the plants. Considering this, the present study is designed to evaluate comparative pharmacognostical profiles of stem and leaf powder of Bacopa monnieri and Bacopa floribunda. The study also attempts to evaluate bacoside A quantitatively in the stem and leaf powder of Bacopa monnieri and Bacopa floribunda.

Materials and Methods
Collection of the drug
Whole plant of Bacopa monnieri was collected from the Foundation for Revitalization of Local Health Traditions (FRLHT), Bangalore, in the month of December 2011 and Bacopa floribunda was collected from Jamnagar in December 2011. Both the plants were identified, authenticated by a pharmacognosist and preserved in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar, vide no. Phm. 6037 and 6038, respectively. The reference standard of bacoside A was procured from M/s Natural Remedies Pvt. Ltd. Bangalore.

Macroscopic evaluation
Macroscopic characters of fresh leaves like size, shape, color, surface, venation, presence or absence of petiole, apex, margin, base, lamina and texture were noted.[34]

Microscopic evaluation
Thin, free hand sections of the stem and leaf were made and washed with chloral hydrate. Diagnostic characters of the sections and powders of both stem and leaf were studied with and without staining. The microphotographs were taken under a Carl-Zeiss binocular microscope attached with a camera.[56]

Preparation of sample solution
The leaf and stem powder samples were accurately weighed (1 mg/mL) and extracted with methanol for 24 h and filtered and evaporated off. The dried material was again dissolved in methanol and used for Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) identification.

Preparation of standard solution
The reference standard stock solution (1 mg/mL) of bacoside A was prepared in methanol. From the stock solution, further dilutions were performed to procure the lower concentrations.

Chromatographic conditions
To quantify bacoside A-stationary phase: Precoated silica gel GF 254 (E. Merck), mobile phase: Dichloromethane: Methanol: water (4.5:1.0:0.1 v/v/v), sample volume: 5 μL, sample for HPTLC:methanol extracts of leaf and stem powder of the plants and standard bacoside A solution, spray reagent-Vanillin-sulfuric acid.

Instrumental conditions
Application mode: Camag Linomat V, development chamber: Camag Twin trough chamber, plate: Precoated Silica Gel GF254, chamber saturation: 30 min, development time: 30 min, development distance: 7 cm, scanner: Camag Scanner III, detection: Deuterium lamp and Tungsten lamp, data system: Win cats software.

Procedure
The TLC plate was washed with methanol and then the standard as well as the sample solutions were applied to the plate as sharp bands (6 mm) by means of a Camag Linomat V sample applicator. Then, the plate was dried in a current of air. The mobile phase (10 mL) was poured into a twin trough glass chamber and the whole assembly was left to equilibrate for 30 min. The plate was then placed in the chamber. Later, the plate was developed until the solvent front had travelled a distance of 80 mm above the base of plate. Then, the plate was removed from the chamber and dried in a current of air. Later, detection and quantification were performed with a Camag TLC scanner 3 at short UV (254 nm), long UV (366 nm) and derivitisation with Vanillin sulfuric acid.[7]

Assay
Standard and sample solutions were spotted on the HPTLC plate (E. Merck). The percentage of bacoside A present in the leaf and stem powder of both the plant extracts was calculated by comparing the areas measured for the standard solution.

Linearity
Linearity was performed by applying the standard solution at different concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 7.5 μg/μL spot on a 10 cm × 10 cm HPTLC plate precoated with silica gel GF 254 (E. Merck) in the form of sharp 6 mm bands. The distance between two adjacent bands was 9 mm. The plate was developed in a solvent system of dichloromethane: Methanol: Water (4.5:1.0:0.1 v/v/v) up to a distance of 80 mm at room temperature. The plate was dried in air. The detector response for bacoside A was measured for each band at a wavelength of 254 nm using the Camag TLC scanner and win CAT software Camag HPTLC instrument catalog No 0276481(Switzerland).[8] The peak areas of bacoside A were obtained by plotting a graph of peak versus applied concentration of bacoside A (5 μL) [Figure 1].

Discussion
Comparative characters of both the plants, like powder microscopy, T.S. of stem, T.S. of leaf and morphological characters, are discussed in Tables 3-6, respectively. The method applied in the present study utilizes silica gel GF 254 HPTLC plates as stationary phase and dichloromethane: methanol: water (4.5:1:0.1 v/v/v) as mobile phase, which gives fine tune separation of bacoside A (Rf. =0.58) standard, although the powder sample was found loaded with a number of components [Table 7]. The identified band of bacoside A in the sample extract was confirmed by overlapping the UV absorption spectra of sample with that of reference standard at 366 nm [Figures 12-14]. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 2.5-7.5 μg/spot and the correlation coefficient was determined. 3-D densitogram at all wavelengths shows comparative Rf value of sample with standard [Figures 15-16] and derivatisation with vanillin sulfuric acid of the powder sample as that of standard at Rf value 0.94 for bacoside A.

Conclusion
Morphologically, the leaves of Bacopa monnieri are fleshy and succulent (yields more extract) than Bacopa floribunda leaf. The taste of the leaf and stem powders was strong, with bitter ends in mucilage, while Bacopa floribunda was only bitter in taste. The Bacopa monnieri leaf and stem showed more lignified fibers, oil globules, tannin material and prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate than Bacopa floribunda. Study revealed presence of higher bacoside A content in Bacopa floribunda, i.e. 26% in leaf and 27% in stem, compared with Bacopa monnieri, i.e. leaf 22% and stem 18%. Considering the hemolytic action of bacoside A, it seems that Bacopa monnieri is more popular in regular use, than Bacopa floribunda.[9]
