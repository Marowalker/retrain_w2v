India leads the world with maximum number of diabetes patients being termed as the “diabetes capital of the world.” Certain risk factors including unsatisfactory diet, overweight, and a sedentary lifestyle are potentially reversible. Acharayas have widely described the role of diet and activities to control Madhumeha (type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) along with medications. Habitual consumption of roasted or dry Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) flour, Mudga (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) and Amalaki (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) prevents the manifestation of Prameha.

Aim:
To assess the clinical effects of dietary interventions and life style modifications in Madhumeha patients.

Materials and Methods:
Present study was carried out on 56 patients of Madhumeha from S.S. Hospital, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Dietary interventions and life style modifications schedule was prepared based on Ayurvedic principles and patients were advised to follow this regimen. Three consecutive follow-ups were done for 3 months at the interval of one month each.

Results:
Significant improvement was observed in clinical signs and symptoms along with plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in Madhumeha patients after these interventions (P < 0.001).

Conclusion:
Dietary interventions and life style modifications are two important tools by which adequate glycemic control can be obtained, especially in newly diagnosed T2DM patients and in patients who are on antidiabetic medication, but not properly controlled.

Introduction
India leads the world with maximum number of diabetic patients being termed as the “diabetes capital of the world.” According to the Diabetes Atlas 2006 published by the International Diabetes Federation, the number of people with diabetes in India currently around 40.9 million is expected to rise to 69.9 million by 2025 unless urgent preventive steps are taken.[1] The so called “Asian Indian Phenotype” refers to certain unique clinical and biochemical abnormalities in Indians which include increased insulin resistance, greater abdominal adiposity that is, higher waist circumference despite lower body mass index (BMI), lower adiponectin and higher high sensitive C-reactive protein levels. This phenotype makes Asian Indians more prone to diabetes and premature coronary artery disease. At least a part of this is due to genetic factors.[2] However, the primary driver of the epidemic of diabetes is the rapid epidemiological transition associated with changes in dietary patterns and decreased physical activity as evident from the higher prevalence of diabetes in the urban population.

Treatment prevents some of its devastating complications, but does not usually restore normoglycemia or eliminate all the adverse consequences. The diagnosis is often delayed until complications are present. Since current methods of treating diabetes remain inadequate, prevention is preferable.[3] The hypothesis that type 2 diabetes is preventable is supported by observational studies and clinical trials of diet and exercise. Interventions that work in some societies may not work in others because social, economic, and cultural factors influence diet and exercise. This is of special concern in India, where there is great regional and ethnic diversity in dietary and lifestyle patterns.

Sahaja/Kulaja/Jataja and Apathyanimittaja[4] (diabetogenic diet and activity) are the two important etiological factors that explain the heterogenous nature of this disease. Incidence of this disease increases with age due to natural dominancy of Vata in the old age.[5] In Ayurveda treatment principle of Madhumeha includes bio-purification therapy, palliative care, rejuvenation therapy, dietary interventions and life style modifications. Acharayas have widely described the role of diet and activities to control Madhumeha along with medications. Habitual consumption of roasted or dry Yava (barley - Hordeum vulgare L.) flour, Mudga (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.) and Amalaki (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.) prevents the manifestation of Prameha.[6] In new cases of diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be obtained by diet and life style advice alone in approximately 50%, only 20–30% will need oral antidiabetic drugs and 20–30% will require insulin.[7] In a patient with suspected type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the first line of therapy involves advice about dietary and life style modifications. In this regard, present study had been under taken to assess the effect of dietary interventions and life style modifications in Madhumeha (T2DM) patients on clinical signs and symptoms with biochemical parameters.

Materials and Methods
Randomly 56 patients of Madhumeha (T2DM) from OPD and IPD of S.S. Hospital Ayurveda wing and Endocrine O.P.D were selected for the present study from August 2011 to November 2012.

Discussion
It is elaborately described since ages erratic lifestyle and diet lead to obesity, followed by Madhumeha (T2DM) along with its complications. Acharaya Sushurta[9] and Vagbhata[10] have similar opinion regarding the etiological factors that Apathya-Nimittaja Prameha may be due to intake of more foods, which aggravates Kapha, Meda and Mutra, lack of exercise and other sedentary life styles and it may be compared to T2DM. Excessive sleep during day and night, lack of exercise, laziness and frequent and excessive use of new grains, use of new peas, black gram and other pulses along with Ghrita, Tila, Tilapista etc., and the use of sugar cane juice, milk and its products, fresh wine, Dadhivikara, meat soups of different animals, residing in water or near water and all other materials vitiating Kapha, results into Prameha in susceptible individuals. Consuming foods that are low in fiber and high in glycemic loads is associated with increased risk of DM. The overall metabolic deregulation associated with Madhumeha (DM) causes secondary patho-physiologic changes in multiple organ system that imposes a tremendous burden on the individual with DM and on the health care system. All the above etiological factors of Prameha are similar to the modern concept of DM, which is a major health hazard affecting millions of people all over the world. So Prameha patients must take diet, which nourish the body elements, but will not contribute to the pathogenesis by generating excessive Kapha, Meda, Kleda and Mutra.[11] It must be planned according to agni of patient. According to Charaka, habitual consumption of roasted or/and dry barley (Yava) flour, Mudga and Amalaki prevents the manifestation of Prameha. Yava must constitute the major diet portion of Prameha patient. Yava causes Santarpana without vitiating Doshas. Yava possesses mutual properties, Pittaghna and Kaphaghna and bestowing stability. Earlier studies have shown that Yava has property of antihypertensive effect, gastrointestinal effects, sympathomimetic effects, glycemic/insulinemic effect, metabolic effects and lowers the serum cholesterol level.[121314] Amalaki is highly nutritious and is an important dietary source of Vitamin C, minerals and amino acids. Several studies have shown their antioxidant and antidiabetic properties and also useful in heart and eye disorders.[1516] Mudga contains 64.04% protein and fair source of calcium, iron, Vitamins A and B. Sprouts are a good source of Vitamin B which is important for proper functioning of nerve conduction and these increases Kleda. Several studies have also proved their hypolipidemic, hypotensive and chronotropic effects.[1718] Apatarpana, that is, weight reduction with the help of Vihara in the treatment of Prameha as described by all Acharyas. All these manoeuver help to reduce Meda and Kapha, which are the culprits in Prameha. Sushruta has described different types of exercises helpful for Prameha patients.[19]

Outcome measure of the present study
Dietary interventions and life style modifications improved glycemic control, insulin sensitivity and cardiovascular fitness. Hence, reduction of plasma glucose level, hyperlipidemia and hypertensions were observed in the present study. Reduction of the signs and symptoms, weight and BMI also indicates that dietary interventions and life style modifications are important tools for the management of Madhumeha (T2DM).

Conclusion
It can be concluded that dietary interventions and life style modifications are two important tools by which adequate glycemic control can be obtained especially in newly diagnosed type-2 DM patients. These tools are also useful in patients, who are on antidiabetic medication, without porper control on glycemic index.
