Sir,

The recent publication on aerobic isotonic exercise and Prameha (diabetes mellitus) as per Prakriti is interesting.[1] Authors reported that “blood sugar level, lipid profile have shown strong association with Prakriti and walking in diabetic individuals.”[1]

Indeed, it is no doubt that any aerobic exercise form is useful to health and helps to control metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.[2] However, the success in diabetic control concerns not only on a short-term focus, as measured by fasting blood sugar, but also on stabilizing non-fluctuated blood sugar, as easured by HbA1c.[3] It is interesting to learn the long-term effects of exercises, especially that on the HbA1c biomarker.
