Pharmacopeia considers Bergenia ligulata as official source of Pashanbheda and official substitute is Avera lanta. Review of the literature reveals that 23 different plants are reported in name of “Pashanbheda”. Ammania buccifera is an adulterant, which is used in Kerala under the name of Pashanbheda, found in moist places of India. The present study was undertaken to compare the roots of both the plants and to have a brief view point on similarities and dissimilarities between the plants. The pharmacognostical evaluation reveals that the rosette crystals of B. ligulata are bigger in size compared to that of A. buccifera and cork is present in B. ligulata, whereas it is absent in A. buccifera. HPTLC shows similar Rf values of both the drug, The quantitative estimation showed that total phenol content of both the drug was almost equal.

==== Body
Introduction
Bergenia ligulata is considered as official source of Pashanbheda and in Kerala Ammania buccifera is used under this name.[1] Plant is mostly found in water logging places throughout India.[2] The chemical constituents on B. ligulata and A. buccifera are well-established,[34] but no pharmacognostical study has been reported till date. Therefore, the present study was aimed at comparing the pharmacognostical and phytochemical profile of A. buccifera roots with that of B. ligulata rhizome.

Materials and Methods
Macroscopic evaluation
Macroscopic characters of both the rhizome and root were recorded as per visual observation.[56]

Organoleptic evaluation
The color, odor and taste of both the rhizome and roots and the powder were recorded separately.[56]

Microscopic evaluation
Free hand sections were taken, cleared with chloral hydrate and then with phloroglucinol and hydrochloric acid. Histochemical tests for constituents such as tannin, mucilage etc., was done. Microphotographs were taken by using Carl Zeiss binocular microscope attached with camera.[56]

Phytochemical evaluation
Physical evaluation
In physical evaluation, moisture content, total ash, acid insoluble ash and extractive values viz., alcohol and water soluble extractive values were determined. The ash value represents the inorganic salts present in the drug[78] [Table 1].

Table 1 Physiochemical parameters

Preliminary phytochemical screening
The Methanol and water extractive was used to carry out the preliminary screening. The extract was further subjected for the presence of various constituents such as alkaloids, tannins, phenols and for Flavonoids. Quantitative estimations of total tannin content and total Phenol content[9] were done. High performance thin layer chromatography[10] was carried out for spectral comparison of both the samples[78] [Tables 2–4].

Result and Discussion
Macroscopy
A. buccifera
Is an herb belonging to the family Lythraceae and grows in water logging areas. Roots are dicot, externally spongy, leaves sessile, axillary inflorescence, flower sessile, red in color, fruit capsule globose. Roots arises at nodal region, spongy, whitish, measuring about 10-15 cm long, 0.3-0.5 cm in diameter, transversely cut surfaces shows outer spongy smooth in touch, no distinct odor, with astringent taste. [Plate no. 1].

B. ligulata
It belongs to family Saxifragaceae. It is a perennial herb with thick rootstock. Leaves simple, orbicular to broadly obovate, fleshy, entire, strongly ciliate, inflorescence corymbose scapes, fruit Globose. Rhizome is solid, barrel shaped, cylindrical, 1.5-3 cm long and 1-2 cm in diameter. With ridges, furrows and root scars distinct, odor - aromatic, taste - astringent.

A. buccifera (root)
T.S. of A. buccifera root
Circular in shape, outermost layer epidermis somewhat barrel shaped epidermal cells loosely connected filled with yellowish brown coloring matter followed by loosely arranged spongy parenchyma with numerous air spaces between cells, i.e. aerenchyma. Parenchyma cells filled with numerous rosette crystals of calcium oxalate, starch grains and yellowish brown contents. Endodermis single layer slightly barrel shaped cells followed by a single layer pericycle. Vascular bundle radially arranged protoxylem toward center metaxylem toward the periphery each xylem pockets separated by biserrate-multiserrate medullary rays, phloem occupies above the xylem, xylem consists xylem parenchyma and few fibers [Plate no. 2].

Powder microscopy
B. ligulata rhizome
Organoleptic characters: Odor aromatic, taste astringent, pinkish brown and coarse powder.

The diagnostics character of B. ligulata root powder shows cork cells in surface view, big rosette crystals and simple starch grain also in groups along with prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate in cortical zone, tannin contents in the epidermal region, fragments of parenchyma with tannin content, fibers and sclereid, fragments of pitted and annular vessels are observed from vascular bundle region [Plate no. 3].

Plate no. 3 Bergenia ligulata powder characters

A. buccifera root
Organoleptic characters: No distinct odor, with astringent taste, blackish brown and coarse powder.

The diagnostics character of root powder shows rosette and prismatic crystals smaller in size compared to that of B. ligulata, lignified fibers, starch grains are seen in groups from cortex zone, lignified and beaded parenchyma from stellar region, pitted, spiral and annular vessels fragments are seen from the vascular bundle region [Plate no. 4].

Plate no. 4 Ammania buccifera powder characters

Comparative pharmacognostical study
Many similar and dissimilar characters were observed between powdered roots of B. ligulata and A. buccifera. The similar characters were rosette crystals, groups of starch grains are found in both the powders, moreover tannin content is found in both powders. The dissimilar characters were rosette crystals of B. ligulata is bigger in size compared to that of A. buccifera. Cork is present in B. ligulata, whereas it is absent in A. buccifera.

Phytochemical results
Comparison between track 1 and track 2 was done by spectral comparison on similar Rf value found in the short and long UV radiations, the different Rf values overlapping in both the samples are 0.04, 0.24, 0.35, 0.55, 0.94, 0.96. These graphs show the overlapping zones present in B. ligulata (rhizome) and A. buccifera (root) [Plate no. 5].

Discussion
Habit and habitat of both plants are similar in nature, both the roots are dicot, have simple leaves, pharmacognostical studies shows evidence of rosette and prismatic crystals of calcium oxalate, which shows the maximum accumulation of calcium content in the plants, coloring matter and simple starch grains in groups are observed in both the plants. The Phytochemical evidence shows 60% similarity. Thus it can be concluded that A. buccifera may be used instead of B. ligulata. Further, studies require its genome analysis and noble compound investigations, isolation, pharmacological evidences.

Conclusion
A. buccifera used in place of B. ligulata regionally in many parts of India, morphologically shows similar identity as well as in habitat, pharmacognostical evidences shows that presence of rosette crystal, which play very significant role in identification. Phytochemical evidence shows 0.04, 0.24, 0.35, 0.55, 0.94, 0.96 Rf values similarity with help of spectral comparisons, The quantitative estimation also shows that total phenol content is B. ligulata (rhizome) 4.03%, whereas, A. buccifera (root) 4.04%. This study is helpful in identification. It further requires scientific evaluation at molecular level, marker compounds and some more pharmacological evidence for establishment.
