Introduction
Child health has assumed great significance in all over world. Its importance is being realized more and more by pediatricians and general public in developing as well as developed countries. Here the health means, should be physically and emotionally fit in all directions, because almost every organic illness results in some degree of emotional disturbance and vice versa.

In Ayurvedic classics, the brief description regarding Shayyamutra is found in Sharangadhara1 and Vangasena Samhita2. In this disease mainly Vata (Apan Vayu), Pitta (Pachaka), Kapha (Tarpaka), alonga with Manasika dosha tama are involved (vitiated). Dushya involved is Rasa (Ambu) dhatu. Vitiation of Mutravaha and Manovaha srotas is found in the form of untimely and increased fequency of urine at night.

Enuresis is a behavioural problem and the most common chronic problem in childhood next to allergic disorders. Children are not considered enuresis until they have reached 5 years of age and this behaviour is clinically significant as manifested by either a frequency of at least twice a week for three consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant distress in social academic or other important areas of child's functioning.The prevalence of enuresis is about 15-25% of children at 5 years of age, 8% of 12 years old boys and 4% of 12 years old girls, only 1-3% of adolescent are still wetting their bed. Boys suffer more often than girls because girls typically achieve each milestones before boys34.

Discussion
Effect of therapy
As already mentioned that, the study was conducted under two groups. Group A received Divyadi yoga (D1) along with counseling (psychological intervention) and group B received counseling along with Divyadi yoga (D2 Placebo).

The effect of the therapy was assessed on the basis of improved status in the number of dry nights. For the purpose of making comparison between pre and post treatment, the history of bedwetting in last one week was documented. Last one week history had shown that maximum patients, i.e 60% of group A (n=20) and 50% of group B (n=20) had no dry night (all wet night), out of 40 patients, 55% patients had no dry night. The 15% patients of group A and 10% patients of group B had 2 dry nights. The 10% patients of group A and 15% patients of group B had 3 dry nights and same percentage of both group patients had 4 dry nights. The 5% patients of group A and same percentage of group B had single dry night, 5% patients of group B had 5 dry nights (Table 3).

Before treatment the status of bedwetting incidence once per night was in 45% of patients of Group A and 55% patients of Group B. The 40% patients of group A and 40% patients of Group B had 2 incidences/ night; 15% patients of Group A and 5% patients of Group B had 3 incidences/night. It means before treatment 50% of total patients had incidence 2-3 times/night (Table 4).

Effect of therapy according to weeks
Although the patients were followed up every fortnightly but the improvement in dry night status recorded weekly.

After 1st week treatment it was observed that slight changes in dry nights status and incidence/night occur in both groups. Shifting of few patients towards increased dry nights and reduction in incidences was noticed of both group but improvement in group A was more than Group B.

After 1st week treatment statistically both the groups A and B showed significant (p< 0.01 in Group A and p< 0.01 in Group B) result. But according to the percentage of improvement, Group A showed better result (7.43%) in comparison to Group B (5.13%).

After 2nd week treatment decrease in zero dry nights of both groups and 2 dry night of Group A and 3 dry nights of Group B but increase of percentage 1 dry night of both groups and 2, 4 dry nights of group B was seen. Status of incidence/night showed increase of both incidence of both groups (more in Group B) but decrease of 3 incidences/night and Group B showed decrease in 2 incidence / night. In both Group A and B the result revealed statistically significant after 2nd week treatment (p<0.005 - Group A and p< 0.001 - Group B).

After 3rd week treatment no patients of Group A had zero dry nights in 3rd week, while in Group B 25% patient had zero dry nights in comparison to before treatment. Three incidence/night was found absent in both groups, increase of one incidence in both groups, increase patients of 2 incidences/night of group A and decrease patients of Group B. In Group A, the result was observed highly significant (p< 0.001) after 3rd week treatment, while in Group B it was significant (p<0.005). Percentage of improvement was found 20.79% in Group A and 19.59% in Group B.

After 4th week treatment no patient had 3 incidence/night was found. Both the Group A and B (p<0.001) were statistically highly significant and percentage gain of Group A was 29.70% and in Group B was 20.51%.

After 5th week, 10% patients of Group A and 10% patients of Group B achieved 5 dry nights. Percentage of patients was found decreased in 2 incidence/night of both group and increased in 1 incidence of both groups. The result showed improvement of 38.61% in Group A and 19.23% in Group B and both groups showed statistically highly sigriificant results.

As evident that after 6th week treatment both groups showed highly significant (p<0.001) percentage improvement of Group A was found 44.55% and Group B was found 28.85%. Study revealed that after 7th week treatment statistically highly significant results were observed in both the groups with percentage improvement of 52.48% of Group A and 37.82% of Group B. After 8th week treatment, statistically highly significant (p< 0.001) result was observed in both the groups. The percentage gain was 65.35% in Group A and 40.38% in Group B. After 9th week treatment highly significant (p< 0.001) relief in bedwetting was obtained in Group A and Group B, while the percentage improvement was more in group A (76.73%)than the Group B (42.95%). After 10th week treatment result showed statistically highly significant (p< 0.001) in both the groups with gain percentage of 86.14% in Group A and 48.72% in Group B. After 11th week treatment it was observed highly significant (p< 0.001) results in both the group but the gain percentage more in Group A was 80.60% as compared to Group B (48.72%).

Study revealed that after completion of drug trial (after 3 months of treatment) 60% of patients of Group A achieved all (7) dry nights but no patients of Group B achieved all (7) dry nights; 30% patients of Group A and 25% patients of Group B achieved 5-6 dry nights. Only 5% patients had 4 dry nights and only 5% patients had zero dry nights in Group A. The 20% patients had 3 dry nights and 35% patients had 2 dry nights in Group B. As far as incidence / night is concerned 60% patients of Group A achieved no incidence/night, 40% patients had one incidence/night in Group A; 15% patients had 2 incidence/night and 85% patients bad one incidence/night of Group B.

After 3 months treatment both groups (Group A - counseling along with Divyadi Yoga (D1), Group B-counseling with Placebo) showed highly significant (p<0.001) results. But according to percentage of improvement Group A showed better result (89.60%) in comparison to Group B (48.72%).

Various precious studies indicate that after discontinuation of therapy incidence of relapse increased remarkably. Most of the modern drugs have such tendency. To observe the relapse status of trial drug, monthly follow-up continued upto 2 month after treatment was performed. Observation have shown that 10% patients of Group A and 25% patients of Group B showed remission of disease.

After 2 month follow-up (after 3 month treatment Group A showed statistically insignificant (p> 0.1) result. In Group B the result was statistically highly significant.

Effect of therapy on Associated Symptoms
Effect on Fear: The relief obtained from fear was statistically highly significant (p < 0.001) of Group A after treatment but insignificant (p> 0.1) in Group B. The gain percentage was 62.96% in Group A as compared to 15.38% in Group B; on follow-up 2 months after stopping treatment study revealed insignificant (p< 0.1) result in recurrence of fear.

Effect on Aggressiveness: After treatment highly significant (p< 0.001) relief was observed in Group A but insignificant in group B. The gain percentage was 60.87% in Group A but 30% in Group B. On follow-up after 2 month stopping the treatment result shows insignificancy in recurrence of both the groups.

Effect on Shamefulness: Statistically highly significant relief from shamefulness at the level of p<0.001 was observed at the end of 3 months therapy with the Group A i.e. Divyadi yoga D1 along with counseling; Whereas insignificant results (p> 0.1) was obtained by the Group B. The percentage gain was 61.90% of Group A, but 20% of Group B. On follow-up 2 month after stopping the treatment shamefulness was found statistically insignificant of both the groups.

Effect on Irritability: After the treatment of 3 months irritability in bedwetting patients was reduced with the highly significant at the level of p< 0.001, but significant in Group B. On follow-up the recurrence in this symptom was found insignificant in both the groups.

Effect on sleep: Statistically highly significant result was found after the 3 month of treatment sleep of Group A patients but insignificant in Group B. On follow-up Group A showed insignificant result but Group B showed no change.

Effect on constipation: After 3 month of treatment the therapy was highly significant in the relief of constipation of Group A, but insignificant in Group B. On follow-up, Group A showed insignificant (p> 0.1) result, but Group B remain unchanged in symptom as constipation.

Effect on activity: The therapy was able to yield statistically highly significant at the level of p<0.001 on activity of Group A, but insignificant (p<0.1) of Group B. On follow-up the result showed insignificant (p< 0.1) in both the groups.

After discontinuation of therapy incidence of relapse was found markedly through various previous studies. To observe the relapse status of this trial drug monthly follow-up continued upto 2 month. Observation have shown that recurrence was observed more in Group B than Group A. The recurrence was statistically insignificant at the level of p> 0.1 of group a but highly significant (p< 0.001) of Group B.

The remission was found higher in GroupB as compared to Group A. It indicates the drug compound is effective in the treatment of disease but counseling too plays vital role in preventing the disease. There by Group B shows more chances of remission in which placebo and counseling was used for the treatment.

The trial drug compound Divyadi Yoga possess multiple properties like Balya, rasayana, Medhya, Srotoshodhaka, Mutrasamgrahana and Krimighna etc.

Conclusion
Shayyamutra is a common socially disruptive problem. Ayurvedic literature has very brief description of Shayyamutra. Srotovarodha and vitiation of Sadhaka, Tarpaka Kapha, Pachaka Pitta, Manovaha Srotas and Atinidra are the factors responsible for development of Shayyamutra. Kapha - Vataja Trait of Shareerika and Sattvika - Rajasa trait of Manasika Prakriti can render a child more prone to Shayyamutra. Counseling along with drug therapy proved to be more effective in this study. As this research was a time bound project, hence further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of counseling (sattvavajaya chikitsa) with more techniques for long duration. For better palatability the trial drug should be in granule form rather than Avaleha. However, the study was conducted on a small scale sample, even then all over results were found to enthusiastic, further to come out for better conclusion this should be progressed involving work psycho-neuro-pharmacological study.
