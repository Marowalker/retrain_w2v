Darvyadi Yoni Varti is an Ayurvedic formulation indicated for the management of Garbhasaya Grivamukhagata Vrana (cervical erosion). Though a number of drugs are available in modern medicine, interest towards Ayurveda is gaining. Drugs with Vranasodhana, Ropana and Prasadana properties like Sphatika, Darvi, Haridra, and Lodhra are useful in this situation and are selected to prepare Yoni Varti.

Aim:
To standardize and evaluate preliminary pharmacognostical as well as physicochemical profiles of Darvyadi Yoni Varti.

Materials and Methods:
Raw material was analyzed in the Pharmacognostical Laboratory for genuinity before converting into Varti. Finished product was analyzed by following pharmacopoeial standards.

Results:
The pH value of Darvyadi Yoni Varti was 5.0, water soluble extract was 23.3%w/w, alcohol soluble extract was 8.7%w/w, ash value was 5.16%w/w, loss on drying was 71.73%w/w. High performance thin layer chromatography was carried out; in which maximum 10 spots at 254 nm and 3 spots at 366 nm were distinguished.

Conclusion:
Pharmacognostical study of raw drug revealed the quality and genuineness of all the constituents of Darvyadi Yoni Varti.

Introduction
Yoni Varti (vaginal suppository) is an unique Ayurvedic formulation mentioned for the management of Yoniroga (gynecological disorders). This makes it widely acceptable. In gynecological disorders, local route is mostly preferred against oral as high concentration of drug can be expected at the target organ by passing systemic circulation.[1] About 85% women suffer from cervical erosion.[2] It adversely affects the physiological as well as psychological health of women and even interferes in their professional life and may even lead to infertility[3] or may show malignant changes in the chronic stage.[4] Though many synthetic drugs are available for this condition are known for side effects. Considering this researchers are behind traditional drugs that can provide satisfactory answers.

Acharya Shushruta has mentioned Sphatika, Gairika, Tuttha, Kasisa, Lodhra, Rasanjana, Darvi, etc. in Upadansha Chikitsa.[5] Some of the drugs mentioned in this context like Darvi (Berberis aristata DC.), Lodhra (Symplocos racemosa Roxb.), Haridra (Curcuma longa L.), Suddha Sphatika (purified alum), and Suddha Gairika (purified ochre) and Madhu having Vranasodhana, Vranaropana and Prasadana properties were selected for Yoni Varti preparation. Darvyadi Yoni Varti, one such formulation is effective in gynecological disorders. But, pharmacognostical and preliminary physico-chemical profiles are not available till date. Considering this it is planned for physico-chemical evaluation of the Darvyadi Yoni Varti.

Materials and Methods
Drug material
Darvi, Lodhra, Haridra, Suddha Sphatika and Suddha Gairika were collected from the Pharmacy, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar. Gelatine, honey and propylparaben sodium salt were purchased from local market. The ingredients of Yoni Varti are given in Table 1.

Table 1 Ingredients of Darvyadi Yoni Varti

Pharmacognostical evaluation
Raw drugs were identified and authenticated as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopeia of India[6] in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory. The identification was done based on the morphological features and organoleptic features. Later, Varti was dissolved in small quantity of distilled water, filtered through filter paper and filtrate was studied under the Corl zeiss microscope attached with the camera, with stain and without stain. The microphotographs were also taken under the microscope.[7]

Methods of preparation of Darvyadi Yoni Varti
Kwatha (decoction) of equal parts of Darvi, Lodhra and Haridra was prepared by adding 8 times of water and reducing to 1/4. This was further boiled on mild flame to prepare semisolid. This was added with purified Sphatika and Gairika and stirred with a spatula to prepare homogeneous mixture. Gelatine and preservative were added to this and was heated until complete melting. Honey was added to mixture and poured into lubricated mould and allowed to set in the refrigerator for 30 min. The prepared oviform shaped Varti of 3g each were stored in refrigerator to avoid disintegration and contamination.

Physicochemical analysis
This Darvyadi Yoni Varti was analyzed by using various standard physicochemical parameters at Pharmaceutical Chemistry Laboratory. Parameters such as, loss on drying,[8] pH,[9] water soluble extract, and methanol soluble extract[10] as per Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) were considered.

High performance thin layer chromatography
Methanolic extract of Darvyadi Yoni Varti was spotted on pre coated silica gel GF254 aluminum plate as 5 mm bands, 5 mm apart and 1 cm from the edge of the plates, by means of a Camang Linomat V sample applicator fitted with a 500 μL Hamilton syringe. Toluene (8 ml) and ethyl acetate (2 ml) was used as the mobile phase. After development, densitometric scanning was performed with a Camag TLC scanner III (version 3.14) in reflectance absorbance mode at 254 nm and 366 nm under control of win CATS software (version 3.17). The slit dimensions were 6 mm × 0.45 mm and the scanning speed was 20 mm/s.[11] Mild polar component like phenolic acid, sterols well-discriminated through this solvent system hence toluene was selected as solvent in this study.

Results and Discussion
Organoleptic study
The initial purpose of the study was to confirm the authenticity of the drugs used in the preparation of Darvyadi Yoni Varti. Results matched with the API and thus confirmed the genuineness of all the raw drugs. Organoleptic features of Darvyadi Yoni Varti were observed like brown in color, astringent in taste and slippery in touch with a smooth surface [Table 2].

Microscopic study
Darvyadi Yoni Varti shows fragments of pitted vessels, crystal fibers, fibers, starch grains (Darvi), prismatic crystal, oil globule, tanin, lignified fiber (Lodhra), yellow content, fiber, oil globule, starch grains (Haridra) under microscope [Figures 1–12].

Physicochemical parameters
Physicochemical parameters of the Varti like uniformity, hardness, loss on drying were all found to be 90% within the normal range. The water soluble extract and methanol soluble extract values were found to be 23.3% w/w and 8.7% w/w, respectively. Loss on drying was observed 71.73% [Table 3].

Table 3 Physicochemical parameters of Darvyadi Yoni Varti

Loss on drying was found 71.73% due to the use of decoction in Varti which is more prone to degradation. For that propyl para ben sodium salt was added in preparation as preservative. Ash value was due to the presence of Gairika and Sphatika and inorganic constituents of herbal drugs. Water soluble extract was 23.3% indicating that the drug is having good solubility in water.

High-performance thin layer chromatography
HPTLC under 254 nm showed 10 spots at 0.02, o. 45, 0.53, 0.64, 0.70, 0.79, 0.82, 0.087, 0.92 and 0.96 Rf values and under 366 nm showed 3 spots at 0.02, 0.45 and 0.92 Rf values [Table 4, Figures 13 and 14]. Mainly trigger phenolic acid and sterols type molecules and TLC patent obtained can be used as finger printing of the final product.

Conclusion
Pharmacognostical and phytochemical evaluation of Darvyadi Yoni Varti illustrated the specific characters of all ingredients which were used in the preparation. In TLC, 10 spots at 254 nm and 3 spots at 366 nm were found. Toluene as solvent can be used as separation method. Though the groundwork requisites for the standardization of Darvyadi Yoni Varti were covered in the current study, additional important analysis and investigations are required for the identification of all the active chemical constituents of the test drug to substantiate the clinical efficacy. The inference from this study may be used as a reference standard in further quality control researches.
