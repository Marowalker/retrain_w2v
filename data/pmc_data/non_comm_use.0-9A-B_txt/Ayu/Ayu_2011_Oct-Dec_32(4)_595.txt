Sir,

The recent report on Mysore Tridosha scale is very interesting.[1] Shilpa et al. reported the success on developing “a scale to assess Vata, Pitta, and Kapha – the concepts taken from Ayurveda and validated in psychology using psychometric procedures.”[1] The validity and reliability were assessed in this report. However, to use this scale, the information on real clinical usage trial has to be reported. The standardization cannot be received if there is no quality control and quality assurance process. Also, comparison of the proposed scale to other methods is required. Indeed, this reported scale is not the first scaling system. Recently, Suchitra et al. also reported their success on another scale development.[2]
