These properties are present due to toxic and anti-toxic compounds. These compounds can be harmful for the special diseases and may be unsaturated, saturated, open chain etc. The adulteration can take part as catalytic action for the toxic effect for the special diseases. Toxic properties of oils are removed by different ingrediants and methods. C. maxima seed tail (mst) is used with food and medicine. The present paper deals with the study of oil by refractive index and equations.

Introduction
Quality control and standardization of crude and medicated oil is dier need of to-day for putting the oil pharmacy on sound footing. The raw materials brought into market in various forms are frequently adulterated with cheaper, less potent or spurious materials poising danger to public health. Novelty of the dietary and medical oils have been attracting the chemists for the last three or four decades. Pharmocological application encouraged the chemists to go ahead with their work to the relation of diseases. The preliminary values can not solve the problems of bio-sciences. Bio-sciences problems are very wide and deep. Refractive index method has been created as one of the most appreciated techniques to study the different values. The advantages of the method are its simplicity, selectivity and rapidity of determination the values. The study of Cucurbita maxima seed oil has also been done1, but accurate identity is still unclear from the bio-sciences points of view. Few equations have been used for the determination of different constant values, because the pH of human body is made up of between 4 to 8. These equations are also give with a view to provide scientific and systematic informations,which will be highly useful to maintain uniformity and quality of the oil. The purpose of the presentation is to report (1) a new direct random estimation of different values from refractive index value and (2) comparative study of random estimated values with those obtained by using the experimental values for the same of C. maxima seed tail (mst).

Materials & Methods
Refractive index (n) values of (mst) have been determined by Abbe's refractometer and calculated from equations (02) and (03)2–3.



The random estimation of constant values from the (n) have been determined by different equations4–6.

Results & Discussion
Acid, free fatty acids, degree of acidity, molecular weight, apparent density, refractive index, unsaturation values are essential for the potency and life of tail, because free fatty acids have greater medicinal value.

Table 1, different values (glycerol, glyceride, pure fatty acids,number of oxygen required for combustion, lund‘s, relation between neutralization number and equivalent, agni, internal energy), which are determined by equations from (n) of instrument and calculated, are found approximate constant. Slightly variable is found due to temperature effect. So, these equations are very useful for the random estimation of different values. Eq.(02) is not reliable for the estimation of different values of oils, because it is used for purely unsaturated oils5.

Table 1 Random estimation of different values from refractive index (N) of Seed Oil of Cucurbita Maxima

Refractive index values of Abbe's refractometer and calculated by eqs. (02) and (03)have too much dissimilarity, this may be due to effect of temperature, heterogenous properties, polarity and unsaturation7.

Different percentage of (SA) and (USA) in experiment, instrument and calculated confirms some other unsaturated acids or compounds are present in oil, which confirms the values of (OA) and (LNA) of eq. (02).

The controversy of (OA) and (LNA) present in exp. and eq. (02) while absence in eq. (03), indicates the trace amount may be present in (mst). Iodine value of eq. (03) is higher than exp. and eq. (02) values, may be due heat induced surface polymerization910. This is also supported by less iodine values than more (n.o.) values. Lower Lund's values from (n) values indicate the presence of polymerize properties without conjugate double bonds6, but the Abbe's and eq. (02) values do not prove this properties11. Higher acid values from experimental value give positive Kreis test, rancidity may not be possible12. Abbe's iodine value is found less than 100, so it belongs to non-drying group of oil13.

Less value of monoglyceride from pure value (56108.0) may be the presence of impurity or unsaturation14. The constant glycerol values indicate the glyceride, lactones and estolides are absent in oil, but the higher exp. (101.04) from Abbe's eqs. (02) and (03) indicated the presence in oil4.

The relationship between neutralization number and equivalent is of course the same. The Abbe's value is much less than given constant value indicates the semipolar of (mst)15, but eqs. (02) and (03) values are found approximate constant prove the non-polarity14.

Lower agni values (Abbe’s, eqs. (02) and (03)) from experimental value indicate the chain length of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids have been broken1617.

The values of (rD) and (FEV) are useful for the study of temperature and pressure effect, because they are independent on temperature and pressure18. The exp., eqs. (02) and (03) values are found approximate constant indicate more accouracy of groups and elements for the compounds of (mst)19. The various (r) and (α) values show the effect of temperature in crude oil19.
