But, gradually the alchemical use of the subject, declines and the therapeutical use takes over. Rasamritam is the latest doctrine in the field of Rasa shastra which compiles the extract of the older books and adopted some new and contemporary concepts. The practical aspects of this text influence both the academicians as well as physicians in large extent. Keeping the wealthier, timely concept of this text in mind, we are trying to review and analyze it critically for the benefit of researchers and practitioners and hope the idea will be fruitful.

Introduction
Rasa Shastra deals with the knowledge of Parada and other matters pertinent to it, along with the manufacturing of medicines from metal/mineral, animal and some poisonous herbal sources. From the period of Nagarjuna (7th AD), both the alchemical and therapeutical use of the Rasa Dravyas were carried out by the Rasa Siddhas and Rasa Vaidyas. Due to the increase of diseases, advancement of science and decreasing of classical knowledge and sufficient practical textual references for alchemical methodologies and techniques, the therapeutic use of Rasa Dravyas dominates over it. The text Rasamritam is full of practical therapeutic use of different Rasa Dravyas and their processing techniques. In Rasamritam the classification of the drugs their descriptions, are presented in a very systematic way, instead of following the traditional method. The division of chapters are very much ideal. Description of indices with practical applicability at the end of the book is the magnitude of this text.

Author’s recognition
Vd. Yadavji Trikamji Acharya was born on 1881 at Porbandar in Gujarat, has contributed to Ayurveda in general and Rasa Shastra in particular by writing and editing many books and manuscripts like Rasamritam. Simultaneously he was a well known physician, academician and administrator. He authored the text Rasamritam, on 1951 which was published by Motilal Banarasi Das in Nirnaya Sagar Press, Kolbhat Street, Bombay. After a very fruitful and far-fetched life he met the super soul on 1956.[1]

Vd. Yadavji Trikamji was one of the pioneers of Ayurveda. He was one of the most helping hands to Dr. P. N. Mehta who founded Gujrat Ayurveda University. Acharya Yadavji served Gulabakunvarba Ayurveda Mahavidyalaya as teacher, consultant and principal. He helped Vd. Hari Prapana Sharma for compiling Rasa Yoga Sagara. He also edited and published Madhukosha Vyaksha of Acharya Madhava, and Ayurveda Deepika of Acharya Chakrapani. In the series of Ayurvediya Granthamala he has edited and republished many books like Ayurveda Prakash, Rasa Prakash Sudhakar, Rasa Kamdhenu, Rasa Sanketa Kalika, etc. As an organizer, administrator, he chaired the Nikhila Ayurveda Mahasamhelana at Haridwar (1925), Gwalior (1932), Delhi (1950) and again in Haridwar (1953), He authored Dravyaguna Vigyana, Ayurvediya Vyadhi Vigyana.[2,3]

Subject matter of Rasamritam at a glance
This book consists of total 09 chapters and 09 indices. As Parada is a central element of whole Rasa Shastra, it is described as first chapter followed by Gandhaka in a separate chapter.

All the Dhatus (metals) like Swarna, Rajata, etc. are described along with Khanija (minerals) of the corresponding Dhatu like Makshika for Tamra, Abhraka for Loha etc. and Mishra Dhatus like Pitala, Kansya, etc. in a same chapter under the name Loha Vigyaniya.

Drugs of Malla, Sudha, Sikta, Lavana, Kshara, Ratna are discussed in individual chapters. The last chapter consists of some compound formulations of therapeutic interest.

At the end precious information and instructions are given regarding different pharmaceutical and clinical aspects in 09 indices.

Information regarding Puta and preparation of Bhasma is given in 1st index. 2nd and 3rd indices consist of description of Chapala and Shilajatu.

In 4th index special discussion on Makshika and Vimala is described. Authors own view on Rasaanjana is given in 5th index.

6th and 7th indices are the collection of adverse and toxic effects of Rasa Dravyas and mineral materials from which Satva can be extracted.

Shodhana method of some plant materials frequently used in preparation of different compound formulations are given in 8th index. 9th index consists of the list of references from Charaka and Sushruta Samhita, where Rasa Dravyas are described.[4,5]

Analysis of Dehavada and Dhatuvada on Rasamrita
Rasamritam is massively enriched with the descriptions of Dehavada (transforming the sick body to healthier one through Rasaoushadhies).

In the first chapter only 08 Sanskaras of Parada are given which indicates its use for Dehavada.[6,7]

Description of Gandhaka in a separate chapter, after Parada possibly facilitates the Dehavada motto of the author.

No description of Abhraka, chief material for Dhatuvada[8]as a separate chapter shows the less importance of Abhraka in comparison to Gandhaka in this particular text.

Other materials like Makshika, Rasaka, Chapala, etc. are described in the line of Dehavada.

Description of pharmaceutical processing’s like Shodhana and Marana (no any alchemical processing’s like Charana, Ranjana, etc.) in different chapters for specific materials followed by their therapeutic use strengthens the Dehavada idea of the book.

Special discussion on Puta and Bhasma in the indices indicates the dominance of Dehavada over Dhatuvada.

In the last chapter description of 66 Rasaoushadhies and no description of any method regarding Dhatuvada (alchemical processings) anywhere in the book, clears the concept that the book is a dominating book of Dehavada.

In this chapter the author has described 66 Rasa Yogas which include Kharaliya, Parpati Rasa and Pottali Rasa. Only one Asava i.e Lohaasava is included.

Indices
1st index. (Information regarding Bhasma and Puta)

Regarding the Bhasmikarana the author has the following views:
At first the material to be incinerated should be subjected for Shodhana and specific Shodhana procedures where applicable, then powdered. Associated minerals (Haritala, Manahshila, Hingula, etc.) are added and pounded followed by addition of liquid media prescribed for particular material then subjected for bhavana at least 10-12 h.

Pellets should be flat rather than rounded, it should be completely dry before keeping into Sharava, one pellet should be in between 1-2 Tola.

He emphasized on sealing of the joint of samputa to facilitate more time of contact of main material with associated materials like Gandhaka, Parada Manshila, as these are volatile in nature. Also due to toxic nature of these vapours.

He suggested not sealing of the joint where the associated materials like Parada and Gandhaka are not added, particularly, in last 2-3 puta, to facilitate direct contact of fire and oxygen to the material to be incinerated.

He suggested that during the arrangement of pellets in the casseroles not more than two layers should be kept, to facilitate equal distribution of temp to all pellets.

The casseroles used for Samputa should not have more depth to allow less space in between the Samputa.

In case of Abhraka, Loha, Mandura, Tamra and Makshika initial Putas should be given in more fire and later on fire should be lowered.

For Suvarana, Rajata, and Naga the initial putas should be given in less fire and later on fire should be increased.



2nd and 3rd indices
4 types of Chapala i.e whitish, blackish, greenish, and reddish are described and said that it melts like Vanga hence called Chapala. It causes Rasa Bandha.

Properties of Shilajatu along with its formation and Grahya Lakshana, Shodhana procedure of Shilajatu in the technique of Agnitapi and Surya Tapi and features of Shudha Shilajatu are described (in parameters of smell, taste and solubility). Different Anupana of Shilajatu are also indicated like Dugdha, Takra, Mamsa Rasa, Salasaradi Gana Kashaya etc.

4th index
Historical approach of Makshika from Samhitas.

Two types i.e Kanchnabhasa - Madhura and Rajatasannibha – Amla are described

The author identified that the material having one iron and two sulphur molecule and having features like- with angles, six surfaces, and brassy in color is Vimala. Its yellow variety is not-reacted with air and white variety reacts with air to form Kasisa and sulphuric acid. He called it Dwigandhayasa.

According two author Makshika is the conversion of Vimala. Two types of Makshika are described 1st one is bronzy yellow, having same composition as Vimala but presents with different shape and features (neither specified nor named). 2nd type contains 02 molecule of copper and Iron and 01 molecule of sulphur, an extra element and is known as Suvarna Makshika.

5th index
Author differentiates Rasaanjana and Rasauta and claimed that Rasanjana described in Rasa text should never be the Rasakriya of Daruharidra it may be Rasauta.

As the synonyms of Rasanjana are Rasagarbha, Rasotbhava which indicates its formation from Parada and it may be yellow oxide of mercury. He quoted comments of Dr. Vamana ganesha Desai and Dr. D.A Kulkarni.

9th index
Descriptions of about 90 materials refereed from different Samhitas, which are frequently used in different context of Rasa Shastra.[4–6]

Practical aspects of Rasamritam
The book is compiled with the aim to overcome the controversies regarding both in academics and pharmaceutical point of view.

Author has not classified the raw material as like Maharasa, Uparasa, Sadharana Rasa, etc. he started with Parada the most important material followed by Gandhaka second most so far as Dehavada is concerned. Then metal and followed by the minerals and compounds of that particular metal. This rather looks systemic.

Too many pharmaceutical techniques for the processing’s of metals and minerals are described by the use of many associated materials (like Bhavana Dravya, Marana Dravya, etc.) in available literatures. But the author tried to describe only those methods which are easier and could be performed practically with available associated materials.

The author has clear view regarding the sanskara i.e only 08 Sanskara is described with a single procedure for each which could be performed practically. For therapeutic purposes.

Regarding Puta and Bhasma very practical approach is described in 1
st index i.e about pellets, sealing of joint firing technique for different materials etc.

Description of Shodhana of some herbal poisons drugs are very much practical and expressed in simplest way.

Description of adverse effect of the mateials which are either taken in Ashudha condition or in improper Marita (Bhasmikarana) condition in one place makes the clinicians easy to access the patient who take a compound formulation.

Description of around 66 important formulations helps the clinicians practically as these are less easy to manufacture and administer.

Demerits of the text
No description of Paribhasha is available, which is a lacuna of this book.

Description of Dhanyabhraka and Amritikarana are not found in context of Abhraka.

Conclusion
Very systematic classifications of materials are found in this text.

The book is mainly based on Dehavada and hardly any description of Dhatuvada is found.

The description of 09 indices at the end, are most valuable part of this book which describes the practical utility of manufacturing processes of Rasa Dravyas.

It is a literature of modern era where amalgamation of modern chemistry and Rasa Shastra occurs. Also incorporation of some Unani drugs are found.

List of references of materials from Charaka and Sushruta are found in one place.

All most all materials are described in very brief manner and unnecessary, practically unusable methods are not discussed.

The book could prove beneficial for an academician as well as the practitioners who are preparing medicine for their own patients particularly for Rasa Vaidyas.
