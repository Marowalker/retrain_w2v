Tonsillitis is a common illness in the childhood period. There are about 7,455,494 cases of tonsillitis in India per year. Tonsillitis can be compared with Tundikeri in Ayurveda. In the present study, Kanchnara Guggulu tablets and Pratisarana of Tankana-Madhu were selected.

Aim:
To evaluate the effect of Kanchnar Guggulu and Tankana-Madhu Pratisarana in the management of Tundikeri in children.

Materials and Methods:
In the present study, a total of 31 patients aged between 5 and 16 years attending the outpatient department of Kaumarbhritya Department and Shalakya Tantra Department were registered. Among them, 26 patients completed the treatment. Kanchnara Guggulu tablets were administered orally in Group A and in Group B, Pratisarana with Tankana-Madhu was done along with the oral administration of Kanchnara Guggulu tablets.

Results:
The results showed that in Group A, 21.43% of patients got complete remission, 42.86% of patients got marked improvement and 35.71% of patients got moderate improvement. In Group B, 25% of patients got complete remission, 58.33% of patients got marked improvement and 16.67% of patients got moderate improvement.

Conclusion:
Both the groups showed highly significant results in all cardinal and associated features of Tundikeri. Kanchnara Guggulu and Tankana-Madhu Pratisarana are a safe and effective modality for the treatment of Tundikeri.

Introduction
Tonsillitis is a common illness in the childhood period resulting from pharyngitis. A person of any sex and age may fall victim to bacterial infection, leading to tonsillitis. It is a common condition with nearly all children being infected at least once.[1] There are about 7,455,494 cases of tonsillitis in India per year and about 200,000 tonsillectomies are performed in India per year.[2] Any infection in a growing child usually hampers the immune system and the routine growth and development and when there are repeated attack, it is seen more. Recurrent tonsillitis is seen commonly in children and this has many adverse effects on the normal growth and development of the child among these missing school days; economic burden of treatment, etc. are few to name. The repeated tonsillitis wherein the tonsil gland gets inflamed and enlarged repeatedly, after treatment the size remains same though the inflammation subsides which leads to obstruction in the throat both to airways and digestive tract, which may pose problems in deglutition later. Besides medical management with antibiotics, the only other option is surgical removal of tonsils.

A disease which is similar to tonsillitis in clinical presentation in Ayurveda is Tundikeri which is described under Mukha Roga. Dealing with the treatment of the disease Tundikeri particularly, Acharya Sushruta mentions that Tundikeri is the Bhedya Roga and it should be treated as per the line of treatment of the disease Galashundika.[3] All drugs should have the properties such as Lekhana, Shothahara, Sandhaniya, Ropana, Rakta Stambhana and Vedana Sthapana. The drug Kanchnar Guggulu has all the above properties and it is indicated in the conditions such as Granthi, Apachi, Galaganda and Shotha. Therefore, the present study was planned to evaluate the effect of Kanchnar Guggulu and Tankana-Madhu Pratisarana in the management of Tundikeri (tonsillitis).

Materials and Methods
Patients who fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected from the outpatient Department of Kaumarbhritya and Shalakya Tantra of IPGT and RA. The ethical clearance for the same trial in children was obtained from the institutional ethics committee (Ref-PGT/7-A/2012-13/1964 dated: 21-09-2012). Trial was registered in the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), Reg. no. CTRI/2013/05/003635 (Registered on: 13/05/2013).

Criteria for overall assessment
Overall effect of therapy was assessed by below-given criteria:


Complete remission: One hundred percent improvement in clinical signs and symptoms

Marked improvement: More than 75% improvement in clinical signs and symptoms

Moderate improvement: More than 50% and up to 75% improvement in clinical signs and symptoms

Mild improvement: More than 25% and up to 50% improvement in clinical signs and symptoms

No improvement: Equal to or less than 25% improvement in clinical signs and symptoms.




Statistical analysis
For the analysis of data, paired and unpaired t-test were applied, respectively, for thorough statistics within the group and comparison between the groups, and P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 was considered as statistically significant, P < 0.001 as highly significant, and P > 0.05 as insignificant.

Observations and Results
A total of 31 patients (16 patients in Group A and 15 patients in Group B) were registered in the present study. Among them, 14 patients in Group A and 12 patients in Group B completed the treatment. Two patients were discontinued in Group A and three patients discontinued in Group B. One patient discontinued due to irregular visit. One discontinued due to transfer of his father out of Gujarat. One patient did not came for after treatment evaluation.

In the clinical study, maximum number (45.16%) of patients belong to the age group of 7–10 years. Majority of the patients were males (67.74%), belong to Hindu religion (96.77%), had completed primary education (67.74%) and were from middle-class family (87.10%).

Discussion
In the present study, majority of the patients were from the age group of 7–10 years. As the lymphoid tissue of Waldeyer's ring is most immunologically active between 4 and 10 years of age with a decrease after puberty may be the reason behind the recurrent infection of tonsils in children. 67.74% had primary school education. It shows that this age group is more susceptible to tonsillitis.[4] Children are also more exposed to crowd at school and this increases the chance of spread of infection. There is natural dominancy of Kapha Dosha in childhood[5] and Tundikeri which is a Kapha Pradhana disease is more prone in children. In the present study, maximum patients, i.e. 87.10%, belonged to middle class. Financial condition does not directly produce any disease, but it affects the nutritional status and immunity of the child.

Statistically highly significant (P < 0.001) improvement was found in all the cardinal features of the disease Tundikeri in both the groups, but comparative data between the group were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) [Table 11]. Toda occurs due to Vata Dosha and Kanchnara Guggulu and Tankana both have Vatahara property. Both the drugs have Shothahara property and Pratisarana is also an Upakrama of Vranashotha.[6] Therefore, Shotha was subsided in both the groups. Daha occurs due to vitiation of Pitta Dosha.[7] Majority of ingredients of Kanchnara Guggulu have Tikta and Kashaya Rasa which pacify Pitta Dosha[8] and it showed better result when combined with Pratisaraniya drug. Jwara was relieved in 100% of patients in both the groups. It may be due to Dipana and Pachana properties of both the drugs which correct Mandagni, thereby increasing the digestive power and removes the Ama condition present in Jwara.[9]

Table 11 Comparative effect of Group A and Group B on chief complaints

Statistically highly significant (P > 0.001) improvement was observed in all the associated symptoms in both the groups. Raaga is the feature of inflammation which occurs due to vitiation of Pitta and Rakta. Both the formulations have Shothahara, Pittahara, and Rakta Shodhana properties, hence reduction in Raaga was observed. Aruchi is produced by Mandagni and intervention has Dipana and Pachana properties which correct Mandagni and helps to correct Aruchi. Dysphagia occurs in Tundikeri due to the inflammation and enlargement of tonsils. Kanchnara Guggulu has Shothahara property which results in relieving dysphagia. Better result was found in Group B due to the effect of Pratisarana drugs which showed better result in relieving Shotha and reduces dysphagia. As Kanchnara Guggulu is mentioned for the treatment for Granthi, Apachi, and Gandamala, it may have effect on lymph glands and this was the reason for the reduction in enlargement of lymph nodes. Comparative data of all the associated symptoms were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) [Table 12].

Table 12 Comparative effect of Group A and Group B on associated symptoms

In all the laboratory parameters, effect of both the groups was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) and comparative data were also statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) [Table 13 and 14].

Probable mode of action of drugs
The mode of action of any Ayurvedic drug is based on Samprapti Vighatana of that particular disease. Samprapti Vighatana is also said to be the line of treatment. To understand the mode of action of drug, we have to think upon Samprapti Ghataka and how drug breaks the chain of that Samprapti. Ayurvedic pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are based on the principle of Rasa-Panchaka, i.e. Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka and Prabhava. According to these parameters, probable mode of action of Kanchnara Guggulu is discussed below.

Majority of the ingredients of Kanchnara Guggulu have Tikta, Kashaya, Madhura Rasa; Ushna Virya; Katu Vipaka; Laghu, Ruksha, Ushna, Tikshna Gunas and Tridoshahara and Shothahara property. Due to Tikta, Kashaya Rasa, Laghu and Ruksha Guna, Kanchnara Guggulu subsides the aggravated Kapha Dosha.[10] Due to Ushna Virya, it subsides Vata and Kapha Dosha. Pitta Dosha is subsided by the Tikta, Kashaya, and Madhura Rasa properties of the drug. Due to its Ushna Virya and Laghu, Ruksha Guna, it stimulates the Agni and due to its Ushna, Tikshna, Laghu Guna and Ushna Virya, it removes Srotorodha and vitiation of Rakta Dhatu is normalized by Tikta, Kashaya and Madhura Rasa properties of the drugs. Tundikeri occurs due to vitiation of Kapha and Rakta and due to above properties, Kanchnara Guggulu decreases the vitiated Kapha and Rakta and hence, it is effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of Tundikeri and inflammation of tonsils.

Probable mode of action of Tankana-Madhu Pratisarana
Ayurveda explains that Rasa acts when it comes to contact with mouth, Vipaka acts after digestion and Virya acts at both level internally and externally. Hence, for the mode of action of Pratisarana drug, we have to rely on Rasa and Virya of drug. Tankana has Katu Rasa, Ushna Virya and Ruksha, Tikshna Guna. Madhu has Madhura, Kashaya Rasa, Laghu, Ruksha Guna, Shita Virya and Madhura Vipaka. Madhu also has Yogavahi property which acts as a Sahapana of Tankana. Tankana has Kaphahara property.[11] Due to Katu Rasa, Ushna Virya and Ruksha, Tikshna Guna and due to Ushna Virya, it also subsides aggravated Vata Dosha.[12] It also stimulates Dhatvagni when applied locally. Due to its Ushna Virya and Ruksha, Tikshna Guna, it opens the microchannels and removes the Srotorodha. Due to the Lekhana property, it corrodes the hypertrophied muscle tissue. Due to its Ruksha Guna, it has Kledahara property.[13] Due to its Katu Rasa, it causes “Shonita Sanghatam Bhinatti”[14] (clears the obstruction in Raktavaha Srotas).

Conclusion
Tonsillitis shows close similarity with Tundikeri. Both the groups showed highly significant results in all cardinal and associated features of Tundikeri. However, both the groups showed insignificant effect in laboratory parameters. Hence, Kanchnara Guggulu and Tankana-Madhu Pratisarana are safe and effective modality for the treatment of Tundikeri.
