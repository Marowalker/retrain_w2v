It has a wide range of therapeutic applications, including in diseases like Prameha, Streeroga, and so on. The practice of Rasaka Bhasma preparation has declined with time due to various reasons. The present study aims to identify the genuine samples of Rasaka, prepare Rasaka Bhasma by subjecting it to Shodhana and Marana, and undertake a physiochemical analysis of the prepared Bhasma with an eye toward the standardization of Rasaka Bhasma.

Introduction
Rasaka comes under Maharasa Varga. It is an ore of zinc, which was used to extract ‘Yashada’ (zinc) in ancient times. It was also used in the preparation of brass (Pittala).

The synonyms, types, Shodhana methods, and Satvapatana Vidhi of Rasaka have been elaborately described in Rasarnava the oldest treatise of Rasashastra. Since the beginning it has been known by the name of Rasaka or Kharpara, and the Satva obtained from it is called ‘Yashada’ following the invasion of India by Arabs in the fourteenth century.[1]

In the classic texts, there are two methods described for the preparation of Rasaka Bhasma: One is by using Parada and subjecting it to Valuka Yantra Pachana, and the second method is by using Shuddha Patra Haratala by giving three Putas.[2]

Aims and Objectives
The present study was aimed to study pharmaceutical aspect of Rasaka Bhasma and establishment of Rasaka Bhasma with the analytical findings.

Materials and Methods
Selection of raw materials
Grahya Rasaka,[3] the Mruttikabha variety of Rasaka, is considered as Shreshta. Some Acharyas have associated Mruttikabha Rasaka with ZnCo3 and some with ZnO; because of this uncertainty, the samples of both have been taken for use in this study.

Shodhana of Rasaka
The reference from Rasatarangini was followed for shodhana of Rasaka.[4] Ingredients used were as follows.

Ingredients and quantity


Procedure
Rasaka was taken in a Khalwa Yantra. Nimbu Swarasa was added and the mixture triturated until it had totally dried up. The procedure was repeated seven times. After that it was washed with water until the Amleeyata of the Nimbu Swarasa was removed. It was then allowed to dry.

Marana of Rasaka
The marana of Rasaka was carried out as per reference from Rasatarangini.[2] The ingredients were as follows.

Ingredients and quantity


Procedure
Shodhita Rasaka (ZnCO3 and ZnO, one sample each) was taken after weighing 30 g of each. This was placed in a Khalwa Yantra and an equal quantity of Shodhita Haratala was added. This was mixed well by trituration.

Sufficient water was added to get a consistency fit for preparation of a Chakrika. After it had attained a proper consistency, Chakrikas were made, having the size and shape of a Palasha Beeja. The Chakrikas were allowed to dry properly. These Chakrikas were then taken in a Sharava after recording their weights before and after drying. Sharava Sandhi Bandhana was performed. Then Puta was given by using Vanopala thrice. The procedure was repeated for each Puta.

Results (Pharmaceutical process)
Shodhana of Rasaka: A = Raw Rasaka sample of ZnCO3,A1 = Shodhita sample. B = Raw Rasaka sample of ZnO,B1 = Shodhita sample



Marana of Rasaka: A2 = Rasaka Bhasma from ZnCo3, B2 = Rasaka Bhasma from ZnO



Analytical results
Tables 1 and 2 provide the results of the analysis carried out on the Rasaka Bhasma.

Table 1 Results of analysis of the Rasaka sample (ZnCO3)

Table 2 Analytical results of Rasaka sample (ZnO)

Discussion and Conclusion
After using classical parameters for the identification of Rasaka, two samples were taken up for analysis: ZnCO3 and ZnO. Both the samples were subjected to Shodhana using Nimbu Swarasa. A fragrant odor in the ZnO sample after Shodhana was obtained, which may have been due to trituration with Nimbu Swarasa.

The prepared Bhasmas were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analysis. The result showed that there was not much difference in LOD, but there was a difference in the pH of the samples before Shodhana, after Shodhana, and after Marana. The pH of zinc carbonate before Shodhana was 8.73, after Shodhana 7.79, and after Marana 7.73. In the case of zinc oxide, the pH was 6.04 before Shodhana, 6.48 after Shodhana, and 5.9 after Marana.

In the case of ZnCO3 the percentage of zinc present was as follows: before Shodhana it was 48.95%, after Shodhana 47.26%, and after Marana 53.59%. In the case of ZnO: before Shodhana it was 85.38%, after Shodhana 86.10%, and after Marana 69.51%. There was an increase in the percentage of zinc in the ash of ZnCO3 because of the calcination reaction. However, in the case of ZnO there was reduction in the percentage of zinc because of the oxidative reaction.
