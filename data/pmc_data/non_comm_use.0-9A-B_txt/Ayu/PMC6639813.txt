Dear Editor,

We read the publication on “Association of Kaphaja and Kapha-Pittaja Prakriti and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T allele with type 2 diabetes” with a great interest.[1] Gupta et
al. noted that “The present study gives a strong clue for the association of Prakriti (body constitutional) and clinical phenotype.[1]” Indeed, this finding is interesting and can confirm that the classical knowledge is still presently merit for explanation of the common metabolic disease. However, there are some points that should be noted. The diabetic patient might have other concurrent problems. Metabolic syndrome (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension and obesity) is very common worldwide. The other common diseases in the group of metabolic syndrome might affect the relationship between Kaphaja and Kapha-Pittaja Prakriti and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T allele. Furthermore, aging is another important factor that is related to Kaphaja and Kapha-Pittaja
Prakriti. The pattern of phenotype might be different at different ages.[2] In addition, there are also other common genetic factors that are related to diabetes mellitus.[3] The association between Kaphaja and Kapha-Pittaja Prakriti and clinical phenotype might be affected by those genetic factors. Finally, it should be noted that a holistic concern bio-psycho-social-spiritual dimension or Vataja, Pittaja and Kaphaja dimension should be mentioned if we would like to discuss on a phenotype of a medical problem. For diabetes pathophysiology, the recent reports showed that Vata has more influence than Pitta and Kapha on insult-related phenotype in diabetic patients.[4]
