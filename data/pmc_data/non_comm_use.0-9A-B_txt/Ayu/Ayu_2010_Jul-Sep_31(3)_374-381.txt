Introduction
The genus Crocus (family Iridaceae) comprises some 85–100 species having an old world distribution, primarily in the Mediterranean – Europe and Western Asia. The limits of the entire genus lie within the longitude 10°W to 80°E and latitude 30°N to 50°N. Phytogeographically, the majority of species occur within the Mediterranean floristic region, extending eastward into the Irano-Turanian region; both of these areas are characterized by cool to cold winters with autumn–winter–spring precipitation and warm summers with very little rainfall; the genus Crocus is well adapted to such conditions, with the plants actively growing from autumn to late spring and surviving the summer drought below ground by means of a compact corm. Many species have their above ground growth at the onset of autumn rains and flower almost immediately; some of these produce their leaves and flowers concurrently, or nearly so, while others bloom without leaves and delay their leaf production until the onset of warmer weather, usually in spring.[1]

A species evolution is generally accompanied or followed by partial changes in the chromosome complement and there can be few genera where such a wide range of variation occurs. This variation is, however, difficult to deal with without information on breeding systems, hybridization potential and the production of hybrids. So far, it has only been possible to make a comparative analysis of chromosome number and morphology, but these differences and similarities can be significant, and may well indicate barriers to successful interbreeding. Although similar karyotypes do not reveal the presence of symmetrical structural changes, it may generally be assumed that if the phenotypes are also alike, there is a probability that there are no barriers to gene exchange. On the other hand, when karyotypes are observably different, successful interbreeding is less likely.[2] Such chromosome barriers are of obvious importance and can lead on to further divergence which may eventually give rise to acceptable species. The closely related species have been difficult to separate taxonomically and have also been found to be complex cytologically, and have been treated as a series.[3] These physiological characteristics, together with cytological information and morphological features of the corm tunics, bracts, bracteoles, leaves, flowers and seed, have been discussed by the genus into a hierarchy of sub-genera, sections and series of C. sativus.

Crocus elwesii (Maw)[7] O. Schwarz (1886)
Synonyms

Crocus thibautii

Crocus hermoneus

This species was known only from Asia Minor and remained one of the last known species of the sativus group. Maw described it as a plant with large corm and flower, but with short stigmata of Crocus pallasii. In the monograph of Maw,[6] it is closely allied with the well-known and widely distributed form, var. palasii, but is a plant of larger structure. The pistil in short, scarcely exceeding the stamens, as in var. palasii. According to Maw, there was no difference between C. elwesii and C. pallasii, except for the size of the plant. Maw's plates clearly show that the style of C. elwesii divides at the level of the middle of the anthers while in C. pallasii the style divides below the anther. A significant difference in the sativus group is in the absolute length of the astigmatic branches which may vary intraspecifically to a great extent. The style of C. elwasii divides higher than in any other species of this group and this form is the extreme end of the range of variability.[8]

The structure of the plant of C. elwesii varies considerably in the specimens from Palestine, Lebanon and Syria. Some of the specimens approach the size of those from Asia Minor (ca. 20 cm); others resemble middle-sized C. pallasii. The size of C. pallasii ranges from 7.5 to 16 cm.[9]

Another character varying within the species C. elwesii is the scabrosity of leaves. In some specimens, the leaves are scrabrous at margins, and in others, they are smooth or only the tips of the leaves are somewhat scabrous. Mouterde described the leaves of Crocus thiebauti as smooth and those of Crocus lianoticus as denticulate.[10] It is fact that C. elwesii was never clearly differentiated from other species; several species from the eastern Mediterranean were described to be synonymous with C. elwesii. They are given below.


Crocus olbanus Siehe from Cilica[11] : This type of specimen does not seem to differ from C. elwesii except for having paler flowers and narrower perigonium segments.

Crocus oreocreticus Burtt from crete[12] : Burtt differentiated his cretan plants from Crocus thomasii and C. pallasii, but did not mention C. elwesii. Some of the specimens of C. oreocretious were examined and found to be small-sized specimens of C. elwesii.

Crocus thiebauti Mouterde[10] from Syria and Crocus libanoticus Mouterde from Lebanon: Mouterde differentiated C. thiebauti only from Crocus moabiticus. As to C. libanoticus, he says “Se rapprochant per le port general du precedent (C. thiebauti), ce crocus sen femilles denticulees, I absence de spathe basale”. Later, he recognized that his “bracteola minute” of C. libanoticus was actually a short-based spathe.

About C. libanoticus, one reads “Stylus una cum stigmatibus dimidiam anthram vix superat”. Indeed in one specimen each of C. libanoticus and C. thiebauti, the styles were shorter than is usually found in C. elwesii. However, the division of the style is much above the bases of the anthers, as in the rest of C. elwesii from other parts of its area.[8]




Corm flattish, 1.5–2.5 cm in diameter. Tunics numerous, finely reticulate, somewhat produced along the scape, sheathing leaves 2 or 3, basal spathe present, sometime short, proper spathe diphyllous. Leaves numerous, 6–12, appearing toward the end of anthesis, scabrous or smooth at margins, about 1 mm broad. Flowers 2–5, tube much longer than limb. Tepals 3–6 cm long, 5–10 mm broad, usually lilac with darker veins. Filaments short, anthers yellow, linear, 1.5–2.5 cm long. Style dividing above the bases of the anthers, at above 0.33 cm or 0.50 cm the anther's length; stigmatic branches orange, gradually thickening toward apex, reaching the tips of anthers or shorters. 2n = 14, 15.[8] Phenology: Flowering October–November.
