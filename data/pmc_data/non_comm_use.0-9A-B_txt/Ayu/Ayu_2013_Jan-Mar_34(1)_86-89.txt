According to Ayurveda, Kati Shoola is a disease with pain in lumbar region. Lumbar spondylolisthesis, anterior displacement of a vertebra or the vertebral column in relation to the vertebrae below, is one of the common causes. Current case study was carried out at Ayurveda Teaching hospital, Borella, to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment regimen used by Sri Lankan traditional physician family “Weerasinghe.” A 59-year-old female with a 9-month history of lumbar spondylolisthesis was treated with this regimen. The patient had progressive pain in left lower back, right and left buttocks, and difficulty in bending forward over 5°. X-ray of lumbo sacral region indicated that patient was suffering from Grade 3 lumbar spondylolisthesis. She was treated for 65 days with four treatment packages consisting of 13 prepared medicines. The response to the treatment was recorded and therapeutic effects were evaluated through symptomatic relief. Clinical symptoms were significantly reduced and degree of anterior flexion increased from 5° to 90°. However, X-rays indicated that the patient was still suffering from Grade 3 lumbar spondylolisthesis. This regimen is effective in successfully treating Kati Shoola (lumbar spondylolisthesis) by helping to reduce the symptoms and improving the degree of anterior flexion.

Introduction
Kati Shoola is a disease which is mainly caused by vitiation of Vata Dosha. Some ancient texts also describe Kati Shoola as a symptom of some disorders such as Kati Graha, Trika Graha, Prushta Graha, Kati Vayu, Trika Shoola, Prushta Shoola, Vataja Shoola, Trika Vedana, and Grudrasi Vata.[123] The word “spondylolisthesis” comes from the Greek words “spondylos” meaning spine or vertebra and “listhesis” meaning to slip or slide. Spondylolisthesis describes the anterior displacement of a vertebra or the vertebral column in relation to the vertebrae below. It occurs most often in the lumbar spine. Most patients are asymptomatic. Sometimes pain in the low back, thighs, and/or legs, which radiates into the buttocks, muscle spasms, leg pain, or weakness, tight hamstring muscles, and irregular gait can be seen.[4] This condition can be correlated with Kati Shoola.

The treatment regimen, which is described here, is used by the eminent Sri Lankan traditional physician family “Weerasinghe” to treat patients suffering from Kati Shoola successfully. The duration of the treatment is 65 days, using 13 different Ayurvedic and Sri Lankan traditional medicines. So far, no scientific evaluation has been carried out on the efficacy of this treatment regimen. Hence, this clinical study was undertaken.

Results and Discussion
Response to the treatment was recorded, and therapeutic effects were evaluated by symptomatic relief of the patient. It was observed that the patient's clinical symptoms were reduced gradually during the treatment period [Table 1]. Although these symptoms were reduced completely or partially at the end of the treatment, the X-ray of lumbar sacral region showed that there was no change in the condition of lumbar spondylolisthesis and the patient was still having Grade 3 lumbar spondylolisthesis.

Table 1 Evaluation of clinical symptoms

According to the Ayurveda, Shoola (pain) occurs due to vitiation of Vata Dosha. Vata Dosha is vitiated by Srotas Awarodata (obstructions of channels) and Dhathu Kshaya (depletion of tissues/malnutrition). In Kati Shoola Apana Vata is mainly involved. So, the aim of the treatment is to pacify vitiated Vata Dosha, especially Apana Vata.

Ingredients of decoctions of Dashamula Wenivelgeta, Eranda Sapthaka with Rasona Methi Abhaya, Madhu Yashtee Nisha Yugma and Punarnawashtaka, Punarnawasawaya, pills of Chandraprabha, powders of Safufe Surinjan and Thripala, paste of Nawarathna, oil of Nirgundi and Siddhartha, and pastes of Ankenda and Wellangiriya have the properties of Vata Shamaka (pacify the vitiated Vata Dosha), Vedana Sthapana (sedative), and Shoola Prashamana (analgesic), Tarpana (enhance the nutrition), Balya (promote strength), Rasayana (rejuvenation), and Srotha Shodana (purifying channels). As the drugs used in the present study have the above properties, they are beneficial for diseases originating by vitiation of Vata Dosha. These drugs also have the properties of Tarpana (enhancing nutrition), Balya (promoting strength), and Rasayana (rejuvenation), and help in improving the qualities of Asthi Dhatu (bones) and reformation of wasting tissues. Patient suffering from Kati Shoola showed a significant symptomatic relief with this treatment regimen.

Conclusion
It is concluded that this treatment regimen completely or partially relieves the symptoms in Kati Shoola (lumbar spondylolisthesis). These medicines can be utilized in treating patients who are suffering from Kati Shoola, to reduce both signs and symptoms successfully and with greater effectiveness. It is proposed that the therapy may be accepted as a treatment method of Kati Shoola (lumbar spondylolisthesis).
