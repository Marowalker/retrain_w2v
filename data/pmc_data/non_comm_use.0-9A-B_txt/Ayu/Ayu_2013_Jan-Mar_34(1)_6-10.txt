Bhaishajya Kaala (time of drug administration) is an important principle to be considered while treating a disease. Still hardly a handful of physicians are seen, who account for this. To highlight its imperial role in Chikitsa, there is an immense necessity to analyze this concept, which is the need of the hour. Bhaishajya Kaala is mainly explained in relation with Bala of Roga, Rogi, particular Dosha, Dooshya, and various other factors. The comprehensive understanding of this concept involves so many questions as, why there is a difference in the number of Aushdha Kaala? What is the logic behind their indications as well as contraindications? The present paper focuses on the above points to find out the convincing answers.

Introduction
Ayurveda, the most ancient medical science, has great concern regarding the health as well as the ailments of all the creatures living on the planet earth, was preached in the form of Trisutras, namely, Hetu (causative factor), Linga (signs and symptoms), and Aushadha (treatment). The last part of this trio has been given equal importance as the former two. Aushadha Sutra hides many more concepts in its womb as a part of Chikitsa (Treatment). Charaka says the medicine, which is opposite of Dosha, Dooshya, and Nidan (causative factor) or to all of the three will undoubtedly curb the disorder, irrespective of specific features either mentioned or not mentioned.[1] The above statement is followed by another, which says “while treating a disease success can be achieved only when there is proper combination of Desha (region), Kaala (time), Pramana (dosage), Satmya (wholesomeness), Asatmya (unwholesomeness), Pathya (useful), and Apathya (harmful).[2] Among these seven most important factors, Kaala acquires second position, which reflects the importance of Kaala in Chikitsa. Here again Kaala means:


Shad Aveksha Kaala (Six observatory aspects of time)

Dasha Bheshaja Kaala (Ten types of times for the administration of medicine)




Shad Aveksha Kaala
Consists of Dina, Rogi, Aushadha, Vyadhi, Jeerna Laxana and Ritu.[3]

Dina (Different parts of the day)
It indicates particular part of the day, for example, Vamana Dravya (emetics) is to be given in the early morning, that is, Purvahna.

Rogi (Patient)
After assessing the strength of the patient, time of administration for medicine should be selected. If the patient is having good strength, then medicine can be given in empty stomach early in the morning. If the patient is weak, then medicine should be administered along with wholesome food.

Aushadha
Based on the Aushadha, ten Kaala have been told. They are Bhukthadau (before meals), Madhye (in the middle of the meals), Pratahapaschat (after the morning meals), Sayampashchat (after the evening meals), Muhurmuhu (frequently), Samudga (both before and after meals), Bhakta Samyukta (mixed with food), Grasa (with each morsel), and Grasantara (between two morsels).

Vyadhi (disease)
Based on the Vyadhi also the Kaala is classified. For example: In Jwara (fever) every 6th day the medicine has to be changed like Peya (liquids), Kashaya (decoctions), Ksheera (milk preparations), Sarpi (preparations of ghee), Virechana (purgation), respectively, depending on the condition.

Jeerna linga (stage of the digestion of the food)
The Jeerna Lakshanas should be assessed before administering the medicine. Symptoms like hunger, appearance of Vega (natural urges), expulsion of Mala (waste products), clear belching etc., indicate Jeerna Lakshana.

Ritu (nature of the season)
Based on the Ritu, Kaala should be assessed by Chaya (increase of Dosha), Prakopadi (excessive increase of Dosha) Lakshanas told for each Dosha.

Bhaishajya Kaala
Definition
Proper time for administration of Aushadha is known as Bhaishajya Kaala.

‘Aushadha Kaalah – Aushadha Sevanasya Sam aye’[4]

Tarka Sangraha tells that everything is dependent on Kaala[5] The same statement can be extended in the context Bhaishajya Kaala too. Kaala is the Nimitta Karana (reason) of all types of Kaarya (action), hence Aushadha employed in a proper Kaala will result in expected kaarya.

Bhaishajya Kaala, Aushadha Kaala, Bhaishajya grahana Kaala, Aushadha Avacharana Kaala, Agada Kaala, and Aushadhavekshana Kaala are the various synonyms used to indicate time of administration.

Number of Bhaishajya Kaala
There are three different opinions regarding the numbers among Acharyas


10 – Charak,[6] Sushruta,[6] Ashtanga Hridaya.[7]

11 – Ashtanga Sangraha.[8]

5 – Sharangadhara.[9]




Description of Individual Bhaishajya Kaala
Niranna (Abhakta)
Abhakta means administration of Aushadha alone.[8]

Abhakta, Ananna, Nirbhukta, Suryodaye
Jate are used as synonyms. The first three indicate the Kaala in relation to food while the last indicates Kaala in relation to Dina.

Chakrapani says Abhakta means, it should be before food in the morning[10] Food should be administered only after the medicine is completely digested. Hemadri clarifies that medicine should be administered in the Kapha Udreka Gata Kaala[11] Kapha Kaala is one-third part of the day, and later half of this one-third part is Kapha Udreka Gata Kaala. Indu says it should be after one Yaama after sunrise.[12] The medicine is administered in the empty stomach when the Koshtha is devoid of Kapha Utklesha. Because if there is Kapha Utklesha, the medicine will not come in contact with Agni (digestive fire), and will not be digested properly and effect will be either delayed or reduced. Hence, medicine is administered only after the Kapha Udreka is over.

Indications

The action of the medicine administered during this Kaala is enhanced due to the empty stomach. Hence, the physician should see the strength of disease and patient. If both are strong this Kaala should be selected. With this idea the following indications are told:


Disease and diseased both having good strength.

Pancha Vidha Kashaya Kalpanas (five basic formulations): They are heavy and need strong Agni to digest them.

Lekhanartha (scraping) and Utklishta Kapha Pitta: The Apatarpana is the line of treatment in both the conditions. Abhakta Kaala provides a suitable time for the administration of both.

Kapha Udreka Avastha Gata Kaala.[13]




Contraindications
It is contraindicated in children, aged, etc., who cannot withstand the potency of the medicine, administered in this Kaala.[10] It will kill the person like the weak one is killed by the strong one. Thus the simile indicates if one administered medicine without considering the above fact, will produce complications like Glani and even death.[14]

Pragbhakta
Mode of administration

The medicine is administered just before the intake of food.[12] Prakbhojana, Annadau, Pragbhakta, Bhojanagre, Bhuktadau, Poorvabhaktasya are used synonymously to indicate this Kaala.

Indications

Apana Vata Vikruti Gudagata (situated in anus) Vata.[15]

Aged, children, Bhiru (panic), Krishangana (emaciated), weak[16]

For strengthening lower part of the body, diseases of lower half of the body, obesity.[17]

Benefits

Medicine will be digested very quickly without hampering the strength of the person. There will be no regurgitation of medicine as it is covered by food.[17] It destroys the Doshas situated in Amashaya (stomach).

Madhya Bhakta
Administration of medicine in between the food is Madhyabhakt.[17] The synonyms Madhye Bhaktam, Madhye, Madhya Bhaktam, Madhya Bhojana give the same meaning.

Mode of administration
Classics have clearly mentioned that medicine should be administered in between food, that is, first person is asked to consume half part of the food. This food initiates the process of digestion. The Pachaka Pitta and Saman Vata are stimulated by the food taken, followed by this medicine is administered, so that it can act over the Samana Vata, in turn Pachaka Pitta. Then again food is consumed, which covers the medicine and prevents regurgitation of the medicine.

Indications
Samana Vata Vikruti, [14] Koshtagata Vyadhis.[16] Paittika Vyadhis. Agni Udeeranartha in Mandagni.

Madhya Bhakta Aushadhi due to its quality of not spreading (Avisari Bhava)[18] subsides the diseases of Madhya Shareera, that is, the medicine administered during this Kaala acts on Samana Vata. Once this Samana Vata is corrected, Agni or Pachaka starts functioning properly. The Pachaka Pitta nourishes all the Pittas. If Pachaka Pitta is corrected all the other Pittas will also function normally. Hence, it is indicated in Paittika Vyadhis. The main function of the Koshtha is digestion and metabolism. Once the Samana Vata and Pachaka Pitta are functioning normally, the function of Koshtha gets corrected. Hence it is indicated in Koshta Gata Vyadhis.

Pashchatbhakta
Synonyms
Pratah Ashasya, Pashchat, Adhobhaktam, Ante, Adhaha.

Mode of administration
Medicine is administered after food, to subside various diseases related to the upper part of the body, as well as to give strength[19]

This Kaala is divided in two.[14]


Pratah Bhojana Kaala – indicated for Vyana Vata Vikruti

Sayam Bhojana Kaala – indicated for Udaan Vata Vikruti




Indications

Vyana Vata Vikrut.[14]

For strengthening upper part of the body[14]

Diseases of chest, throat, and head.

Diseases of upper half of the body.




Its main indication is Vyana Vata Vikruti. The time Pratah is specifically told because the site of Vyana Vata is Hridaya (heart) and the Hridaya is open during morning. Hence, the medicine administered during morning reaches the Hridaya. It should be administered after food because the Vyana Vata is activated after the formation of rasa so that it can be carried all over the body. Hence, the food is administered first and the medicine is administered later.

Sayampashchat
This comes under Adhobhakta. The mode of administration is defined as the administration of medicine after dinner.

Indication
Udana Vata Vikruti[14]

During night the Hridaya gets closed. The Vyana Vata becomes inactive, which is taken over by Udana Vata. Thus the medicine is administered after dinner.

Udana moves in Nasa, Gala and Urah etc., in the diseases of Jatrurdhwa Vikara this Kaala can be selected.

Antarabhakta
Synonyms
Bhaktayormadhye, Antarabhaktam and Antarbhaktam are used synonymously.

The administration of food in between two meals is called Antarabhakta,[16] means after digestion of food taken in afternoon, Aushadha is administered. Once Aushadha is digested, evening meals is taken. Similar thing is followed in case of night and morning food.

In this Kaala Ahaara and Aushadha Jeerna Lakshana play an important role. The first Antarabhakta is during daytime where as next is one Yama followed by the digestion of evening food as opined by Indu, which is same as that of Nishi (night).

Indications
Hridya, Deepaka (kindling digestive fire), Deeptagni Purush suffering from Vyan Vayu. As it acts over Udana, which is seated in Hridaya, it gives strength to the Manas (mind).[20]

Jejjat includes this Kaala under Madhyabhakta, which is for Samana Vata unlike Vyan Vata as told by others.[21] Chakrapani asserts that Antarabhakta means Aushadha mixed with Anna or mixed with it during Samskara (processing) of Anna (food), but this is considered as Sabhakta according to other Acharyas.

Sabhakta
Sabhaktam means, administration of Aushadha along with food. The mixing is done either with prepared food or during preparation of food.[22] Bhakta Samyuktam, Sannam, and Samabhaktam are identical to each other.

Indications
Aruchi,[16] children,[23] weak, Stree (ladies), Vriddha, Sukumara (mild),[22] Ksheena. To protect Bala and Sarvaangagata Rogas.[22]

In Mandagni (loss of appetite), Aruchi – food is processed with Aushadha and given. As the Teekshnata, strong odour, bad taste of Aushadha are reduced, it is used for administration in women, children, aged, persons with less strength, and one who hates Aushadha.

Indication for this Kaala is not mentioned for any Dosha, but indicated in Sarvanga (complete body) Roga and Kshata Ksheena (emaciated). Aushadha along with Ahara will be digested and Rasa is formed, which will be circulated all over the body with the help of Vyana Vata[24]

Grasa – Grasantarah
Grasa means Aushadha mixed along with each bolus of food,[25] also known as Sagras and Grase-Grase.

Grasantara means administration of Aushadha in between each bolus of food and is known as Kavalantare.[26]

Indications

This is indicated in Prana Vata Dushti[27] and Vajeekaranartha (increasing vigor), Agni Sandeepanartha.[25]

Grasa: can be used where the form of medicine is Churna (powder), Vataka (tablet), Leha (confections).[25]

Grasantara: this is used when one wants to administer the Vamaneeya Dhumapana.




Annapravesh (deglutition) is the function of Prana Vata.[28] The Aushadha administered with each Grasa will come in contact with Prana Vata in Mukha (oral cavity), Kantha (throat), Urah (chest), etc., leading to the continuous contact with Prana and conditions related to that could be easily treated.

Churna should be administered in this Kaala to increase Agni, it may be due to Rukshata (dryness).[25]

Samudga
Samudga refers to the administration of Aushadha both before and after food.[29]

Samudga word refers to Samputaka, which means a box like structure.

Indications
Hikka Roga (hiccough), Kampa (tremors), Akshepa (convulsions), Urdhva Kayagata Vikaras,[29] Pravisruta (spreaded) Dosha-Urdhwa, and Adha Visruta Dosha[30] When the form of medicine is Pana (liquid), Navana (administered through nostrils), Avaleha (confections).[31]

No specific Dosha is indicated for this Kaala instead some conditions like Kampa, Akshepaka, Hikka are mentioned where Doshas are situated in both Urdhwa (upper) and Adho (lower) Shareera. Aushadha administered in this Kaala will be having its effect on Apana, Vyana as well as on Udana Vata.

Dalhana stresses on the word ‘Peeyate’ stating that Aushadha should be in liquid form so that food will be put in a nutshell.[32]

Muhurmuhu
The word Muhurmuhu means again and again, Aushadha is repeatedly taken with or without food.[33]

Indications
Shwasa (dyspnoea), Kasa (cough). Trishna (thirst), Hikka, Chhardi (vomiting), Visha (poison), Swarabhanga (hoarseness of voice).[33]

This Kaala can be broadly divided in two:


Abhakta Muhurmuhu

Sabhakta Muhurmuhu




The indication of with or without food may chosen by considering Bala of the patient. This Kaala is indicated in Shwasa, Kasa, Trishna, Hikka, Chhardi and Visha where continuous Vegas are produced. Hence Aushadha is administered repeatedly so that it can maintain its effect throughout.

Nishi
Synonyms
Swapnakale, Ratre

Administration of Aushadha at night is called Nishi.[34]

Indication
Urdhwajatrugata Vikara (diseases above the neck).[25]

Aushadha should be administered at the time of sleep. According to Ayurveda one should go to sleep after the digestion of the evening food. Hence medicine should be administered after the digestion of evening food. Thus this becomes second Antara Bhakta according to Indu, and it is indicated in Urdhwa Jatru Gata Vikaras. Urdhwajatru is the site of Prana Vata. Thus medicine administered in this Kaala acts over Prana Vata.

Discussion
Vagbhat also explained ten Aushadha Kaala including the Nishi. Hemadri commenting on the same called these Kaala as Shamana Aushadha Kaala. In the present paper also, this aspect has been highlighted. The relation between Kaala and Aushadha is well established in our classics by all the Acharyas. This relation has been neglected now a days, specially while administering the medicine. Such negligence may be one of the reasons for not getting the desired effect from the therapy, as the Aushadha Dravya fails to show its complete effect.

Hence to utilize the Aushadha to its optimum level, Bhaishajya Kaalas have been quoted depending on the predominance of the Doshas, seat of the disease, frequency of attack, etc.

The advantages of Bhaishajya Kaala are wide spread, but they are mainly elucidated in relation with Shamana Aushadhi. Hence they are found to be of limited exploit, in case of emergency conditions, Shodhana (purificatory) therapy and medicine administered other than oral route.

Conclusion
Bhaishajya Kaala are the essential tools for administration of Aushadha, negligence may lead to the grave deficit in the treatment. Evaluation of Vaya, Jeernalinga, Ritu, Vyadhi Dooshya, Desha plays a pivotal role in deciding Bhaishajya Kaala. Vata Dosha has given prime importance in the context of Bhaishajya Kaala, though Pitta and Kapha are considered at some places. The order of Kaalas is different in all Samhitas (classical treatises) without showing any logical reasoning behind this. Bhaishajya Kaala can only be used for Shamanaushadhi and cannot be followed in Atyayika Avastha (emergency conditions).
