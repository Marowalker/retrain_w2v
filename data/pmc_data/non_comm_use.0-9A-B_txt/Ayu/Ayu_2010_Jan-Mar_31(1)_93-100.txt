Shalakyatantra, one of its specialized branch deals with the science of Ophthalmology, Otorhinolaryngology, Orodental surgery & Head; was contributed and developed by Rajrishi Nimi, the King of Videha, who was a colleague of Atreya, Punarvasu, Dhanwantri, Bharadwaja, Kashyapa etc. The available literature related to this speciality is reproduced from original text of Nimitantra in Uttartantra of Sushruta samhita. So Rajrishi Nimi deserves all the credit and regards for Shalakyatantra and for being the first eye surgeon on this earth. The fact regarding the technique of cataract surgery adopted by ancient surgeons is still a matter of debate. Most of the medical fraternity accepts cataract surgery of ancient surgeons as couching procedure but after going through forth coming pages, the prevailing concept will prove to be a myth. It started with extra capsular extraction through small incision during the period of Sushruta Samhita but later shifted to couching like technique by Acharya Vagbhatta. Secondly, the objective of this literary research paper is to find proper co-relation of the disease cataract to those mentioned in Ancient Ayurvedic classic. Linganasha has been inadvertently taken as cataract but this is neither logical nor in accordance with classics. We find detailed description of cataract's differential diagnosis, indications, contra- indications, pre/intra/post operative procedures and complication in ancient texts of Ayurveda. Not only this, vivid description of treatment of various complications of cataract surgery are also given. Needless to say, no other surgically treatable diseases & its complications except Kaphaja Linganasha are given this much attention.

Introduction
Linganasha is a technical descriptive term in Ayurvedic literature, which means loss of vision. (Dalhan)1. Two varieties of Linganasha- loss of vision have been described i.e. reversible and irreversible or curable and in-curable. On the other hand linganasha as a whole can be classified2 as follows:



Endogenous linganasha is described vividly on anatomical and etiological grounds and is said to be the end stage of Timira, a serious disease of the visual apparatus. On anatomical descriptive grounds, when the vitiated body humours reach/invade 4th/last patal/layer of the eye ball (nucleus of the lens), then patient's vision is obstructed, pupil is covered by vitiated body humours then patient perceives only bright illuminating objects that too when the eye (Posterior segment) is normal. This stage of Timira; invading 4th patal (Lens) is labelled as linganasha (Cataract). According to the etiological classification, linganasha is again the 3rd stage of disease Timira, 2nd being Kaach-(ISC).

The clinical picture is as per the vitiating / causative body humours. Among these pathologically classified linganasha only Kaphaja linganasha (KL) is surgically curable rest all being incurable3 & 15 but a misconception about the surgical procedure is still prevailing. The western medical literature considers that surgical procedure depicted in ancient surgical treatise Sushruta Samhita is couching14/1 i.e. displacing the mature catractous lens in capsular bag into the vitreous cavity. This fact is partially expounding the Ayurvedic view point because the said treatise encompassing the view point of Rajrishi Nimi of Videha Kingdom holds a very different explanation. The available description therein is very similar to that of extra capsular cataract extraction that too with a small incision. On the other hand in the later surgeon Acharya Vagbhatta's (5thAD) technique is very near to the of couching.

To explore the facts in this regards and to put forth the correct view point of Ayurveda this literary research was under taken.

Aims and Objects

To review the literature on KL and cataract to establish their relation.

To explore there from the surgical method & procedure adopted by ancient scholars.




Material and Methods
Classical literature on the subject from Ayurvedic and western system of medicine were explored thoughly and where felt necessary help of Sanskrit grammar scholars was taken. The collected classical material was compared and put forth in a systematic manner in the coming pages.

Picture 1 Kaphaja Linganasha

Clinical picture of Kaphaja linganasha4 is as follows


Complete obstruction of vision; the patient can only perceive bright light /object.

Pupillary circle appears to be thick, smooth, and white in color like a white drop of water (fluid) moving on lotus leaf.

Pupil constricts in sun and dilates in shade/dark (+ve Pupillary reaction).

Pupillary circle is mobile/changes its shape on ocular massage.




These clinical features of Kaphaja linganasha invading fourth patala (Lens) exactly simulate the picture of mature/hypermature senile cortical (Cuneiform) cataract, the white and soft cataract.

Exogenous variety of Linganasha (Vision loss)-Sanimitaja and Animitaja types are classified according to known and unknown (idiopathic) exogenous causes respectively. In both these varieties the pupillary circle remains clear, like natural one i.e. jet black in colour5. Both are incurable. Trauma also leads to irreversible loss of vision.

Indications for surgery

Well developed Kaphaja linganasha i.e. fully mature/hypermature cortical cataract with clinical features mentioned above.

Uncomplicated cataract16 e.g. Avartaki etc. following Six complications of Kaphaja linganasha are to be avoided before surgical intervention:


Avaratki: Pupillary circle appears like whirlpool, hyper- reactive, of reddish white colour.

Sharkara: Where linganasha-cataract appears like that of coagulated milk i.e. calcified cataract.

Rajimati: When cataract's anterior surface is seen with linings i.e. anterior capsular calcification or hard cataract.

Chhinanshuka: Pupil is irregular, with tears, charred coloured and painful; i.e. cataract with uveitis and posterior synechiae.

Chandraki: Pupillary area reflects off- white color and its shape is like that of moon; i.e. cataract with retinal detachment.

Chhatrki: The pupillary area (Cataract) is multicolored like that of mushroom i.e. posterior segmental pathologies.

Picture 2 Yav-vakra shalaka

Picture 3 Linganasha Vedhana Procedure

Operative procedure7:

Fix a particular date and time for the operation and pay prayers to the God.

Make the patients sit in O.T. with extended legs, hands resting on seat, hyper extended neck-facing sun (light) in the forenoon. The attendants should make patient sTable

Surgeon should sit in front of the patient at a convenient height and posture.

Eye to be operated upon is given mild sudation and lids fixed with thumb and index fingers. Patient is asked to continuously look towards his nose.

Surgeon should hold the shalaka (linganasha vedhani shalaka) steadily in Right Hand (Gripped with thumb, index and middle finger) and enter the left eye at Daiva Krita Chhidra i.e. keyhole (2/3 parts from Krishna-shukla sandhi and 1/3 parts from the Apang sandhi in the interpalpebral space). The Shalaka should be introduced in the eyeball by rotatory movements; a specific sound of entry of Shalaka inside the eye is experienced which follows a drop of water (Aqueous humour) through the vedhana site.

Steadily pushing forward & manipulating the shalakya until it reaches the drishti mandala (papillary aperture) i.e. on ant surface of the cataractous lens so that lekhana karma is completed under direct vision.

Shalaka is to be gripped in left hand for operation on right eye.

Hold the entered shalaka in situ and irrigate the eye with mother's milk (Human milk) and apply mild sudation on the closed eye with Vata pacifying leaves e.g. R. communis leaves. This will prevent redness, discharge and pain.

There after assuring the patient, push the shalaka to the centre of pupil through rotatory movements. Incision at vedhana site (key hole) should be given before entry of Shalaka (as suggested by a traditional Netra vaidhya in National seminar on netra chikitsa-96 held at GAMC Bangalore).

With the tip of the shalaka in pupillary aperture, Kaphaja Linganasha (Cataract) should be scraped properly to disintegrate the organized material.

To remove this disintegrated cortical/ nuclear matter, Close the nasal cavity opposite to the operated eye and ask patient to forcefully sneeze out through the open nare (ipsilateral to the eye being operated) while keeping the shalaka inside the eye. This will aid drainage of the liquefied cortical matter (by increasing the JVP and in turn increasing IOP.)

Acharya Vagbhatta26 varies in its technique at this step of surgical procdure. He is of the opinion that ask the patient to see towards ground and gently push the cataract downside without any delay, then ask the patient to sneez (as above) so that cataract goes down enough leaving the pupillary aperture (Drishti Mandala) clear.

If the cataract is not completely scraped and extracted out or if it re-occurs (After-cataract) then irrigate the eye again with mother's milk, apply sudation (asearlier) and rescrap the cataract (in pupillary area).

When by doing this procedure the pupil become clear of all kapha/white material-Cataract (like sky clear of clouds) and patient starts seeing fingers threads like objects then shalaka should be slowly removed by rolling out movemnts.

Apply pure ghee in eye and apply the bandage.




Post Operative measures8:
A) Regimen of patient:

Place of patient's rest: In a House/ward which is clean and tidy, made on suitable land, devoid of dust, smoke, blowing wind and direct sunshine.

Bed should be comfortable, of proper length and width, so that patient can do movements comfortably, with, soft mattress covered by clean bed sheet with Pillow facing east with some sharp weapon underneath it.

Posture of patient in bed: If left eye is operated lie in right lateral position or vice-versa and if both are operated lie in supine position.

Patient should listen to pleasing stories etc.

Contraindications11:

Blood letting:

If ocular pain persists, then snehan (oleation), svedana (sudation) and blood letting from veins of temporal or frontal region.

Agnikarma (Moxibustion) on temporal or frontal area (above centre of respective eyebrow).




Discussion
Linganasha is one of the major causes of blindness, which can be either reversible or irreversible depending on its type. Kaphaja Linganasha is the only surgically treatable type, rest all being incurable. The indicated site of puncture/incision for linganasha/Cataract surgery is Daivakrita Chhidra (Key hole), which is the junction of medial 2/3rd and lateral 1/3rd of the area between limbus and outer canthus in interpalpebral space. On measuring this area with Vernier calliper, it is found to be 9 mm on an average. Thus the Daivkrita chhidra (natural point) should be about 6 mm away from the limbus on temporal interpalpebral area. These measurements correspond with Pars plana, the site which is least vascular and devoid of retinal tissue and also the preferred site for intra ocular (posterior segment) approach to the eyeball.

The shape of linganasha Vedhani shalaka is like the flower bud of Jasmine i.e. round, spindle shaped with narrow petiole like base. Such a shape ensures spontaneous and effortless exit of cortical matter from the sides of the neck of Shalaka through wound gap made by wide spindle shaped tip of the shalaka, when the scrapping is being done. This technique given in Sushruta Samhita (reproduced from Nimitantra) closely resembles to extra-capsular cataract extraction.

On the other hand description available in the Vagbhatta Samhita regarding this surgical step differs and is similar to the couching procedure.

After proper lekhana karma (scrapping), a JVP raising maneuver is done i. e closing Nostril opposite to the eye being operated and forcefully sneezing out through the ipsilateral nostril which consequently raises the IOP and facilitates spontaneous exit of scrapped/liquefied lens matter through the incision.

A detailed & critical account related to postoperative care & management of various complications (if arise) of cataract surgery has been given in Ayurveda literature which clearly emphasize that a utmost care in the selection of the patient, pre-operative, operative and post- operative as well as complications if any have been taken.

Conclusion
Kaphaja Linganasha seems to be the proper word to be used for the eye disease- Cataract in modern medical science. Rajarishi Nimi, the king of Videha, who is the original contributor to the science of ophthalmology since the origin of Ayurveda, should be given a due credit that he rightly deserves.

The detailed description of surgical procedure of the ancient eye surgeons of India is suggestive of small incision extra- capsular cataract extraction by temporal approach as per the description available in the Sushruta Samhita (view point of King of Videha-Rajrishi Nimi). On the other hand couching was a later development in the surgical technique of cataract around the period of Acharya Vagbhatta. Couching technique being easy and time saving, remained in practice till mid of the 20th century in many tribal areas of the country.

Some surgeons opines this procedure as pars plana lensectomy; but in that case this should have been referred as AAharana karma (extraction) and there would have been no reference of Punah linganasha (after cataract) as an complication.

A comprehensive and systematic account of pre-operative preparation, operative, technique and postoperative care of the patients and the surgical wound has been given by the ancient surgeons. Besides this, various iatrogenic and postoperative care related complications has been vividly detailed along with their management. Thus the surgical treatment of cataract was selective, systematic and in continuous process of transition since its recognition as major catastrophe in the literature of Ayurveda.
