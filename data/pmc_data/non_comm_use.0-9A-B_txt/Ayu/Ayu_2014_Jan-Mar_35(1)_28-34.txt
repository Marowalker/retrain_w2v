Obesity is considered the world's oldest metabolic disorder. It is not a single disease entity, but a syndrome with many causes including combination of genetic, nutritional and sociological factors. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers obesity as “Insidious, creeping pandemic which is now engulfing the entire world”. Diet and life-style play a significant role both in the development and control of obesity Sthaulya (obesity). In Ayurveda, Acharyas have mentioned about the use of Lekhaniya Vasti to manage the Sthaulya.

Aim:
To evaluate the efficacy of Lekhaniya Kashaya Vasti in patients of Sthaulya.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 70 patients of Sthaulya were registered. Further they were divided into 2 groups each having 35 patients. In Group I (Lekhaniya Kashaya Vasti) group out of 35 patients 32 and in Group II (Pathya) group out of 35 patients 33 completed the follow-up.

Results:
In Group I, mean change was observed in body mass index (P < 0.001), waist hip ratio (P < 0.001). Overweight (P < 0.001), Kshudraswas (breathlessness) (P < 0.001) and Nidraadhikyata (excessive sleep) (P < 0.001) which is statistically significant in comparison with Group II.

Conclusion:
Trial drug is very good combination for Medoghna activity.

Introduction
Obesity is a global problem; affecting estimated 300 million people world-wide its prevalence is increasing in both developed and developing countries throughout the world.[1] Obesity is a world-wide epidemic that is characterized by excess adipose tissue and that contributes to numerous chronic diseases and early mortality.[2345] This epidemic has received both national and international attention due to obesity's detrimental impact on health, the enormous economic burden it imposes and its increasing prevalence.[6] The present epidemic of overweight and obesity in the whole world is an unintended consequence of the economic, social and technological advances realized during the past several decades.[7] With the onset of the industrial revolution increase in the average body size of the population is an additional concern to health care professional. Now a day in fast pace life people are more inclined to food which low in cost, palatable and readily available in prepackaged forms, but it serves high caloric density resulting in obesity. Labor-saving technologies like electronic devices in home have greatly reduced the amount of physical activity that used to be the part of everyday life in olden days, have further promoted a sedentary life-style, particularly among children. The elevating Body Mass Index (BMI), particularly caused by abdominal or upper-body obesity, has been associated with a number of diseases and metabolic abnormalities, many of which have high morbidity and mortality.

Objective

The assessment was carried out before starting the treatment and at each 3 follow-ups of 30 days and the improvement was assessed on the basis of percentage relief and statistical evaluations.

Criteria for assessment of overall effects
For the gross assessment of the result obtained with the clinical trial, the response of the treatment was determined in terms of:

Subjective improvement
Patients were specifically asked about feeling of well-being and improvement in Angachalatva, Atishudha, and Kshudra Shwasa at each follow-up of treatment.

Clinical improvement
Reduction in weight, BMI, arm circumference, Waist Hip Ratio (WHR) was noted at each follow-up.

Hematological and biochemical assessment
Lipid profile, liver function test value was recorded before and after the treatment in registered cases to evaluate the nature and extent of change in relation to course of disease. Hemoglobin in g%, total leucocytes counts, differential leucocytes counts, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), serum creatinine, blood urea and blood sugar values were recorded before and after the treatment in registered cases to evaluate the safety profile of the drug.

Statistical analysis
The data collected were transferred on master chart showing various items/variables in columns and subjects in rows. The analysis of data was performed using statistical software SPSS version 16 and it is developed by International Business Machines Corporation.

Intra-group (within the group) comparison
To test the significance of mean of difference of paired observations (before treatment v/s after treatment) paired t-test was applied.

Inter-group comparison (between the groups)
In case of more than two independent groups, one-way analysis of variance was applied and value of F test was determined, whenever F test resulted statistically significant, post-hoc test was applied for multiple comparisons, identifying significant pairs of groups.

Results
In symptoms like Angachalatva, significant mean reduction was observed and inter group comparison was not significant whereas in Kshudra Shwasa, Gatrasada, Atipipasa symptoms significant mean reduction was observed and Group I was more effective than Group II and on inter group comparison Group I was significant than Group II [Tables 2 and 3].

For an individual, obesity is usually the result of an imbalance between calories consumed and calories utilized. For the present study Lekhaniya Vasti was selected to manage the disease Sthaulya. In whole, with the use of Lekhaniya Vasti, highly significant mean reduction in weight, BMI and WHR were observed in Group I as compare to Group II while in Group II mean weight, BMI and WHR are remained more or less similar at every follow-up and on inter group comparison Group ‘I’ was better than Group ‘II’ [Tables 4 and 5].

Table 5 Comparative effect of therapy on objective parameters in 65 patients of Sthaulya (Comparison between the groups on difference of BT and AT by one way ANOVA test)

In the present clinical study statistically no change was observed in blood urea, blood sugar, serum creatinine and liver function test after trial therapy. Significant mean reduction was observed in serum Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), serum triglycerides, Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) and cholesterol level in I group than Group II, whereas in level of serum High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) no significant change was observed after trial therapy in both the groups [Tables 6 and 7]. Safety profile of the drug serum bilirubin, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphate, serum creatinine and blood urea, there was no significant change in the level of these biochemical parameters within the both groups [Tables 8ȓ10].

Discussion
Probable mode of Action of Lekhaniya Kashaya Vasti

Most of the time there is presence of Ama at Dhatu level, on starting Vasti schedule with Anuvasan Vasti, it can increase the Ama so just to prevent the formation of Ama and to maintain the Samaagni, Deepana-Pachana therapy was given

As a whole the effect of Vasti is encolinic (action on tissue of colon), endcolonic (action inside colon) and diacolonic (for systemic action). The mean retention time of Lekhaniya Kashaya Vasti observed was 35 ± 4.5 min. Thus Vasti Dravyas when reaches in large and small intestine get absorbed from intestinal mucosa, further, due to Laghu, Ushna and Tikshna Guna (properties) of Vasti Dravaya, obstruction of channels are broken down the and morbid material from all over the body are expelled out, thus breaks the pathogenesis of disease Sthaulya (obesity)[8]

Vasti help in Vatanulomana by Tikta (bitter), Katu (astringent) Rasa (taste) and Tikshna Guna present in trial drug, thus helps in the correction of passage of Apana Vayu and these qualities irritate the intestine leading to increased contraction of intestine hence provides less time for absorption of fat from intestine. Vasti therapy may be stimulator for many intraluminal, luminal and whole body function[9]

Trial drug possess cholagogue property, Tikta, Katu Rasa, Tikshna properties irritate the intestine leading to increased propulsive movement of intestine.[10] Hence, provides less time for absorption of fat from intestine

Dravyas present in the trial drug possess choleretics action which causes excretion of bile which further leads to decrease absorption of fat from intestine[10]

Trial drug has, Kutki, have irritant property which damage the structure of villi in intestine hence causes decreased capacity for absorption[11]

Sesamum oil has Katu and Tikta Rasa property. Due to this, it reduces excessive Meda of the body. It also contain Agnideepaka and Vata Nashak property. Agnideepaka property enhances the Jathragni as well as Dhatwagni. Excessive Abaddha Meda will change in Baddha Meda due enhancement of Jatharagni[12]

Tikshna Guna acts on Srotas (channels) immediately and pierces the smallest cells of the vessels and removes the obstruction caused by lipids.[13] These Gunas also activate the Jatharagni and Dhatvagni and maintain their status.[14] Tikta, Katu Rasa, Laghu, Ushana properties present in trial drug are very useful for Ama Pachana, so by means of these properties digestion of Ama, restoration of Agni (Deepana) at the Dhatu level, removal of excessive Kledaka Kapha takes place. Tikta and Katu Rasa are also Kleda and Meda Nashaka.[1516] Tikta and Kashaya Rasas have Lekhana Guna that scraps out excessive Kapha and Meda from srotas. In addition to Lekhana, Kashaya Rasa also has the property of Shoshana[1718] which absorbs the excessive fluids and lipid substances caused by hypercholesterolaemia. Laghu Guna acts as Kaphahara, reduces the tissue weights (Langhana)[1519] and clears the channels of the body (Srotoshodhana). All Dravyas are Ushna in Virya, which oppose any increment of Kapha and Medas by the Vilayan property.[1820]




Conclusion
In present clinical study, significant reduction in BMI and WHR was seen in Group I as compared to Group II. The Lekhaniya Kashaya Vasti is effective (P < 0.001) for weight reduction. Hence, it can be concluded that trial drug is a very good combination for Medoghna activity.
