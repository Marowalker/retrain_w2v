Introduction
Disease is one of the main causes of sorrow. It influences the total efficiency of human beings, resulting in inability to carry on their routine activities. Medicine is the tool by which the disease can be prevented or cured or controlled.

The history of medicine is very ancient. Literature reveal the chronological development of medicaments. Earlier, the herbs were more prevalent but later on when the therapeutic value of minerals and their processing were known and developed then these were also came in frequent use for medicinal purposes. The sources of drug material are herbal, mineral and animal. These are used in various forms in Ayurvedic therapeutics.

According to Ayurveda, equilibrium of Dosha, Dhatu and Mala are responsible for positive health. The herbs and minerals are equally efficient to check the imbalance which occurs during the diseased state. Due to certain better qualities like prompt action, small doses, tastelessness, effectiveness in incurable diseases and long shelf life, mineral preparations are preferred over herbal formulations. Raw materials of the mineral preparation are Mercury, Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron, Lead, Tin, Zinc, Mica, Sulphur etc.

Body consists of more than 70 elements and the deficiency of these essential elements causes various disorders. The supplements of these elements are required in very small amount. Hence the bhasmas of metals and minerals are effective in small doses. These preparations are considered potent for the curative and preventive purposes and also provide strong and healthy body and delays ageing.

Swarnamakshika is well known material used to treat various diseases in the form of bhasma successfully since centuries as single or compound preparation with other herbomineral drugs. There are so many compound preparations mentioned in ancient texts in contexts of treatment of various diseases. In this article it has been tried to compile some effective formulations of Swarnamakshika bhasma from the Ayurvedic literature and presented in a classified way along with its pharmaceutical procedure.

Discussion
Swarnamakshika is a mineral of MAharasa varga used by Rasavaidyas as therapeutics since Samhita period. Specific description about its therapeutic use has not been made available during Vedic period. However in Samhita period, use of Swarnamakshika bhasma is made available in certain Rasayogas, but the pharmaceutical processing of conversion of raw Swarnamakshika into such form to make it suitable for therapeutic use, is not available in any Samhitas. But in text of Post Nagarjuna period, systemic and detailed description about identification, varieties, physical properties, Shodhana, Marana and its therapeutic use as bhasma alone or with other herbominerals, are described. In this study, it is found that Swarnamakshika bhasma is a therapeutic agent with high pharmacological and therapeutic properties. There are so many formulations of this mineral is mentioned in texts of Ayurveda in context of treatment of diseases like Jwara, Shwasa, Kasa, Kshaya, Prameha, Pandu, Anidra, Apasmara, Vatavyadhi and other chronic and dreadful diseases.
