It was observed that there is a common constituent (having 350 mm absorbance maxima) present in both the drug samples indicating that both works on a similar disease. It was also found that the whole plant powder sample of P. foetida has more number of constituents than that of M. tridentata which indicates P. foetida may have a better efficacy than M. tridentata.

Introduction
Prasarani is one of the drugs used for Vata Rogas such as Amavata, Avabahuka, etc. References about Prasarani are found in Charaka Samhita,[1] Sushruta Samhita,[2] Ashtanga Sangraha,[3] Nighantus, etc.

Two species are being used as Prasarani mostly in South India and North India[45] viz,


Merremia tridentata Hallier. f. (Convolvulaceae) [Figure 1].

Paederia foedita Linn. (Rubiaceae) [Figure 2].

Figure 2 Paederia foetida Linn. Plant with flowers

Therefore the present study has been undertaken to compare both the above drugs Analytically.

Materials and Methods
Aim of the study: To compare the the plants Merremia tridentata Hallier. f. and Paederia foetida Linn. under following parameters:-


Phytochemical Review

High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Analysis

Colour Study

Determination of Ash Values




Phyto chemistry

a) Merremia tridentata Hallier. f. – Flavanoidis:- Diosmetion, Lutedin, dissmetin – 7-O-β-D- Glucoside.

b) Paederia foedita Linn. - Paederoside, Paederosidic acid, γ-Lactone, Rutin, 7-O-xylosil glucose, scandoside, Deacetyl asperuloside.[6–9]




Properties
Guna - Guru; Rasa - Tikta; Vipaka - Katu; Virya - Ushna; Doshaghnata - Kapha-Vatashamaka[10]

Determination of Ash values
Ash values of both the plants was analysed for the present study at I.I.C.T., Hyderabad [Table 1].

Table 1 Physical analysis

Colour study
The Colour Study was conducted for the present work at I.I.C.T., Hyderabad under ordinary light and U.V. light for different solvent extractions of both the plants [Table 2].

Table 2 U. V. Analysis with different solvents

HPLC analysis
HPLC analysis of samples of both the plants was conducted for the present study at I.I.C.T., Hyderabad.

The samples of whole plant powders and Kwathas (decoction) of both the plants were taken for chromatographic analysis before the clinical study.

In this present study, a HPLC with a gradient system of pumps (LC-IOATvp of Shimadzu); a Photo-diode Array Detector PDA (SPD-M10 A vp Shimadzu) and a software based data processor (Class-LC 10 vp Shimadzu) has been used. The model has been included with built-in-validation features.

Instrumental parameters like pump flow and detector wavelength were calibrated. For injection a 7725i-rheodyne injector has been used with 20 micro liter loop.

The samples of whole plant powder of both plant were extracted into acqueous alcohol. Kwathas were prepared freshly from both the samples and were also taken for analysis.

In the present analysis, a gradient elusion with acetonitrile and water was done from 40 to 70% acetonitrile. A chromatogram was monitored at 225 nm. The contour chromatogram of PDA detector has helped to select a suitable wavelength for chromatography.

Observations and Results
The chromatograms were found to contain constituents having a general absorbance maxima at 225 nm. All the chromatograms of whole plant powders and Kwathas of both the samples were printed at same wavelengths. It was found that the whole plant powder sample of P. foetida has more number of constituents than that of M. tridentata. This indicates that P. foetida could have a better efficacy than M. tridentata.

The U.V. spectra of Kwatha of P. foetida sample showed a constituent at 4.1 minute which was not found in the M. tridentata
Kwatha sample. It was observed that Kwatha of M. tridentata sample also contain a good number of constituents. Hence the efficacy could be almost equal to that of P. foetida. It was observed that there is a common constituent present in both the samples having same absorption spectra at 350 nm absorbance maxima indicating a common efficacy of both the plants.

Discussion
HPLC Studies: In the present study, even though a thorough chemical analysis was not conducted, the samples under study were analysed on HPLC which is a excellent method for analyzing the natural products.

The common constituents (having 350 mm absorbance maxima) indicates that both the plants M. tridentata and P. foetida work on a similar disease. Even though the constituents between 0 and 10 minutes are found to be similar, the presence of the constituents between 20 and 30 are more in the plant P. foetida than in M. tridentata and hence makes the difference. Chromatographical studies were helped to monitor the commonality of chemistry between both the plants.

In the M. tridentata sample, three molecules at 45 minutes were with λ - max at 280 and 310 nm which were found to be absent in the plant P. foetida. And even though both the plants contain common constituents absorbing at 225 nm, M. tridentata appears to have more number of constituents absorbing in the range of 250 to 350 nms. This indicates that the plant M. tridentata may show more Balya property than the plant P. foetida.

In the present chromatographic study, the analysis helped to know the difference of efficacy between the two samples due to the variation of chemical constituents. The present method may hence be useful for the quality control of the above two plant species.

By the results obtained, it is can be said that both the plants M. tridentata and P. foetida may be useful in treating the Vatarogas. It can be said that among the two, the plant P. foetida may be little more effective than the plant M. tridentata.

Conclusion
The plant Prasarani is in medicinal use since Samhita Period.
