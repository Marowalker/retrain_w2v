Ayurveda considers, Padadari (cracked feet) as disease condition, under Kshudra
Kushtha (minor diseases of skin). Cracked feet also known as heel fissures is a common foot problem characterized by yellowish color of the skin on the heel of the foot, hard skin growth, hardening and cracks in the feet associated with pain, bleeding or itching. Vaidya Manorama, Ayurvedic compendia, recommended Snuhi oil as a remedy for Padadari. An open-labeled clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the effect of Rakta Snuhi-based formulation in Padadari.

Materials and Methods:
Snuhi oil was prepared by mixing Saindhava
Lavana (Rock salt) 24 g; 300 ml latex of Rakta
Snuhi (Euphorbia
caducifolia); 4.8 l. of water, Sarshapa
Taila (mustard oil) 1.2 l. and further heating of oil, following classical guidelines of Sneha
Kalpana. For better acceptability, the medicated oil was then gradually mixed with “Aerosil,” a thickener, for converting the mixture into gel form. Twenty-six patients, diagnosed with Padadari, were treated by applying 3 g (or as per requirement) of Rakta
Snuhi
Ksheera gel twice daily for 21 consecutive days.

Results:
Response to the treatment was recorded on a weekly basis and therapeutic effect was evaluated through symptomatic relief.

Conclusion:
The study yielded statistically highly significant results in symptoms such as cracks associated with pain (P < 0.001), Rukshata (dryness) (P < 0.001) and Kandu (itching) (P < 0.001).

Introduction
Ayurveda treatise considers certain disease conditions under Kshudra
Kushtha (minor diseases of skin) and categorizes Padadari under this group of diseases.[12] Cracked feet is a clinical condition, having dry, itchy skin, hardness around the rim of the heel and cracks or fissures on the outer edge of the heel.[3] The distinct branch dealing with signs and symptoms along with treatment called as Podiatry.[4]

Ayurvedic recommendation of the management of Padadari includes Siravedha (puncture) of the veins of the feet and treatment of affected part with fomentations and unguents. Ayurveda also recommends plastering of the affected part with an ointment composed of Madhucchishta (wax), Vasa (lard), Majja (marrow), powder of Sarja
Rasa (resin obtained from Shorea
robusta), clarified butter, Yavakshara (alkaline formulation prepared from ash of Hordeum
vulgare) and Gairika (Red ochre).[1] Different compound formulations such as Upodikadi oil and Madhucchishtadi paste are also recommended for the treatment of Padadari which contains Sarja
Rasa (resin obtained from Shorea
robusta), Saindhava
Lavana (rock salt), Madhu (honey), Ghrita (ghee) and mustard oil.[5] The trial drug, Snuhi oil, a compound formulation, recommended by two known Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia Bharata Bhaishajya Ratnakara[6] and Vaidya Manorama,[7] is a remedy for Padadari as an external application. A recent review of the literature shows that no scientific study had been reported on efficacy of this classical formulation on Padadari. Euphorbia
caducifolia is a commonly available plant in Saurashtra region of Gujarat and also one of the botanical sources of Snuhi.

Aims and objectives
The aim is to evaluate the effect of Rakta
Snuhi
Ksheera gel in treating Padadari (cracked feet) through an open-labeled clinical trial.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of Snuhi gel
A classical Ayurvedic formulation “Snuhi
Taila,” recommended by Bharata Bhaishajya Ratnakara and Vaidya Manorama, was prepared by mixing Saindhava
Lavana (rock salt), latex of Rakta
Snuhi (E. caducifolia), Sarshapa
Taila (mustard oil) and water, following recommended methods of Sneha
Kalpana (procedure for medicated Ghrita preparation).[8] Details of the ingredients of drugs are presented in Table 1.

Total effect of therapy
Steps for calculating the overall percentage of improvement of individual patient:


Percentage improvement in each patient of every symptom was calculated by the formula



Average of the percentage improvement was calculated

The obtained results were measured according to the grades given in Table 3.




Table 3 Grades for assessment of overall therapy

Criteria	Percentage	
Complete remission	75-100 - complete remission	
Marked improvement	51-74	
Moderate improvement	26-50	
Mild improvement	1-25	
Unchanged	0	
Statistical analysis
The obtained data were analyzed statistically using the Student’s paired t-test, for difference in score before and after the treatment and level of value of P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant (Sigmastat-Software).

Observations and Results
Total 30 patients were registered, among them 26 patients completed the treatment and 4 discontinued due to their personal reasons. Almost 40% of patients belonged to the age group of 18–30 years; among the registered patients, only 13.33% were male and 86.67% were females and about 96.67% of the patients in the present study belonged to Hindu religion, whereas 3.33% belonged to Muslim religion [Figure 1]. Effect of therapy, on chief complaints and associated complaints are showed in [Figures 2 and 3]. There was statistically highly significant results in symptoms such as cracks associated with pain (P < 0.001), Rukshata (dryness of the feet) (P < 0.001) and Kandu (itching of feet) (P < 0.001) [Figure 4]. Effect of Rakta Snuhi gel in one case of Padadari (cracked feet) is presented in Figure 5.

Statistical analysis on the effect of therapy
There was mild-to-marked improvement in the score after treatment. One patient did not show any improvement. Two patients showed marked improvement and complete remission in each. Mild-to-moderate improvement was seen in the rest of the patients in the symptoms of Padadari.

Discussion
The test drugs formulation is composed of latex of Euphorbia
caducifola, Saindhava
Lavana and mustard oil where in mustard oil forms the base. Mustard oil is having Snigdha (unctuous), Ushna (hot) and Kapha Vataghna (pacify to Kapha and Vata
Dosha) properties and possesses Krimighna (wormicidal), Kandughna (anti-pruritic) and Kushthaghna (treating skin diseases) properties.[9]

The Snuhi
Ksheera (latex of E. caducifolia) is having Ushna
Virya (hot potency), Laghu (light), Snigdha (unctuous) property and pacifies to Kapha and Vata
Dosha.[10] Saindhava
Lavana is also stated to have Laghu (light), Snigdha (unctuous), Tridohaghna (pacifies to Tridosha) and Sukshma (subtle) properties.[11]

In case of Padadari, a precise description about its pathogenesis is not available in the classical texts of Ayurveda. Features of crack feet like dry, hard, thickened skin around the rim of the heel can be considered due to Vitiated Vata Dosha leading to Padadari. Exacerbations of Padadari are seen after constantly having close contact of feet with water.[12] Cold climate leads to aggravation of Vata
Dosha, thus leading to exacerbations of symptoms of Padadari, conversely, hot climate shows gradual relief of symptoms.[1]

Mode of action
Many organic substances like lipids act as penetration enhancer and hence give an additional edge to the organo-gel formulations prepared from them. Snigdha (unctuous) and Ushna (hot) properties of mustard oil, Saindhava
Lavana and Snuhi
Ksheera may subside triggered Vata Dosha which is responsible for the development of Padadari. Among the ingredients of formulation, mustard oil has also been reported to be having flavonoids that inhibit PG COX as well as it has been reported to possess antimicrobial[13] and antifungal properties.[14] Saindhava
Lavana has Ropana as (wound healing) activities.[15] E. caducifolia latex is also reported for its antibacterial, antifungal and antimicrobial properties.[16] Its latex is rich in lupeol, a terpene that has a role in inhibiting ergosterol and having wound healing activities.[17] Thus, Rakta
Snuhi (E. caducifolia) gel, in total, possesses a combination of ingredients with a lipid base, ergosterol inhibitors and having wound healing properties. This formulation probably regains the Sneha and Ushna
Guna which subside vitiated Vata, thereby healing of the crack heel.

Conclusion
It can be concluded that in the management of Padadari, E. caducifolia
Ksheera gel, when applied locally, provides statistically highly significant results in symptoms such as cracks associated with pain (P < 0.001), dryness of the feet (P < 0.001) and itching of the feet (P < 0.001). No adverse reactions were observed during the treatment. The present study was carried out as an observational study on a small sample size and for a limited time. Encouraging results in present study should be further verified with large sample size and for longer duration through controlled clinical trial.
