Amlapitta is a commonly encountered disease of Annavaha Srotasa (gastrointestinal system) described in various classical Ayurvedic texts. The cardinal features of Amlapitta are Avipaka (indigestion), Hritkantha
Daha (heart and throat burn) and Tikta-Amlodgara (sour and bitter belching). This disease can be correlated with gastroesophageal reflux disease based on the clinical features. Baladi
Manduram is one of the unique formulations mentioned in Rasa
Kamadhenu indicated for the management of Amlapitta.

Aims:
This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Baladi
Manduram in the management of Amlapitta.

Materials and Methods:
A non-randomized, single-armed, open-labeled clinical trial was conducted in thirty patients having classical symptoms of Amlapitta, administered with 500 mg of Baladi
Manduram twice a day after meals for 30 days. The assessment was done based on subjective parameters, i.e., Amlodgara (sour belching), Daha (heart burn), Gaurava (heaviness), Utklesha (nausea), Avipaka (indigestion) and Kshudha
Alpata (loss of appetite). The results were statistically analyzed using the paired t-test.

Results:
Statistically highly significant relief (P < 0.001) was noted in Amlodgara, Hritkantha
Daha, Utklesha and Agnimandya and statistically highly significant relief (P < 0.01) was seen in Gaurava and Avipaka.

Conclusion:
Baladi
Manduram can be considered as an effective formulation in the management of Amlapitta.

AmlapittaBaladi Manduramgastroesophageal reflux disease
==== Body
Introduction
Gastroesophageal reflux is a disease occurring due to improper functioning of esophageal sphincter. It is a very common disease, affecting up to 8%–20% of adult men and women in the Indian population.[1] It also occurs in children. Patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have the signs and symptoms such as heartburn, chest pain, gastric discomfort, abdominal distension, sour belching, food regurgitation, nausea and reduced appetite. These signs and symptoms can be seen in the disease Amlapitta mentioned in Ayurveda.

Amlapitta has been mentioned in various Ayurvedic texts since Samhita period. This disease has been described in detail in classical texts such as Kashyapa
Samhita, Yoga
Ratnakara, and Bhaishajya
Ratnavali. Amlapitta is considered as a Pitta Pradhana Vyadhi (pre-dominant disease) and possess symptoms such as Amlodgara (sour and bitter belching), Hritkantha Daha (heart and throat burn), Gaurava (heaviness), Avipaka (indigestion), Klama (fatigue), Aruchi (tastelessness), Utklesha (nausea),[2] Antra
Kujana (gurgling sounds in intestines), Hritshula (chest pain) and Vidbheda (diarrhea).[3] Over indulgence of etiological factors such as faulty life style causes vitiation of Vata
Pitta
Dosha. Pitta along with Vata or Kapha slackens the Jatharagni factor responsible for digestion, i.e., Jatharagnimandya (dimunition of digestion). During this state, consumed food becomes Vidagdha (undigested). Later on, it turns into Shukta (acidified) and it remains in the stomach for long. At this stage, Vidagdhajirna (indigestion caused due to acidified chyle) manifests which is the premonitary symptom of the disease Amlapitta. Further, vitiated Pitta gets mixed with Shukta and causes Pitta
Amavisha
Sammurchhana (combination of unmetabolised Rasa and undigested food with Rasa). This condition is called as Amlapitta.[4]

Baladi
Manduram is one of the important formulations mentioned in Rasa
Kamadhenu for Amlapitta.[5] and Rasa
Yoga
Sagara Vol II Pakaradi
Varga.[6] It contains Mandura
Bhasma, Bala roots (Sida
cordifolia Linn.), Shatavari roots (Asparagus
racemosus Willd.), Eranda roots (Ricinus
communis Linn.), Yava (Hordeum
vulgare Linn.), Guda (jaggery), Jiraka (Cuminum
cyminum Linn.), Pippali (Piper
longum Linn.), Twak (Cinnamomum
zeylanicum Blume), Ela (Elleteria
Cardamomum Maton), Patra (Cinnamomum
tamala Nees) and Nagakeshara (Mesua
ferrua Linn.). All the ingredients present in Baladi
Manduram have Kashaya (pungent), Madhura Rasa (sweet), Sheeta
Virya, Madhura
Vipaka, Deepana (digestion stimulator), Krimighna (anthelmintic), Pitta–Kaphahara (pocifies Pitta and Kapha) and Shophahara (reduces oedema) properties. When combined, these drugs are expected to show their synergistic action against Amlapitta. Hence, with an intention to find the efficacy of Baladi
Manduram on Amlapitta with respect to GERD, this drug has been selected.

Materials and Methods

Discussion
Amlapitta is a Pitta dominant disease in association with Kapha and Vata
Dosha. Excess formation of vitiated Pitta is the main pathological mechanism behind manifestation of this disease. The Pitta gets vitiated due to improper dietary and lifestyle habits. The drugs that have Tikta–Madhura
Rasa (bitter–sweet taste), Madhura Vipaka (post digestive effect in sweet taste), Sheeta Virya (cooling energy of substance), Laghu (light), Ruksha
Guna (dry) and pacifies to Pitta-Kapha properties are beneficial in the management of Amlapitta. Numerous herbal and herbomineral formulations are mentioned in Ayurvedic classics for the management of Amlapitta. No previous research works have been carried out in this formulation indicated for Amlapitta. Hence, the formulation Baladi Manduram has been selected for the present research work to evaluate its efficacy in the management of Amlapitta.

In the present study, maximum number (60%) of patients belonged to middle age, which is Pitta-predominant period of life. This may be due to the adoption of busy lifestyle, habitualization to unhealthy food habits and irregular daily regimen, stress and addictions in this age group. Most (57%) of the patients belonged to urban habitat. Urbanization leads to increased pollution; fast and modernized lifestyle; irregular food habits; stressful condition; and usage of fast foods, food additives, adulterants and preservatives. Maximum (57%) numbers of patients were educated. It shows that in this fast and competitive era, stress is the predominant causative factor in developing Amlapitta among educated people. Most of the patients in this study were nonvegetarian; Madhava
Acharya has mentioned excess consumption of nonvegetarian food and Vidahi
Annapana (foods which cause burning sensation inside) as cause of Amlapitta.[7] Maximum (63%) numbers of patients belonged to middle class; the probable explanation for this high incidence may be irregular dietary habits and occupational stress in them. It is evident that the middle class are more prone to stress and strain in their routine life either socially or financially. In the present study, 26% of patients suffered from Mandagni (lowered digestive state) and Tikshnaagni (hyper digestive state) and 24% of patients suffered from Vishamagni (impaired digestive state) and Samagni (balanced digestive state). Classics has mentioned that Mandagni is the main reason for the development of all diseases.[8] Mandagni is the root cause of Ama (toxic residue which is produced after indigestion) formation and it is Ama which is responsible for the development of Vidagdhajirna (early changes of Amlapitta). Tikshnaagni causes excess secretion of gastric juice, which irritates gastric mucosa. Nearly 50% of patients had disturbed sleep while 50% had normal sleep. This type of sleeping habit may be due to discomfort of the disease or extra hours of sleep during daytime which leads to Ajirna. Diwaswapna (day sleep) vitiates Tridosha as per Sushruta and especially Pitta and Kapha
Dosha as per Charaka.[9] Disturbed sleep increases psychological stress which leads to impairment of Agni. This is one of the cause of Amlapitta.[7] Habit of drinking alcohol was noticed in 23% of patients while 20% were smoker and 10% had a habit of chewing tobacco. Intake of alcohol vitiates all qualities of Pitta. Excessive intake of tobacco, gutkha and pan-masala may impair Agni and lead to manifestation of Amlapitta. These factors cause irritation of gastric mucosa and vitiate Dosha mainly Pachaka
Pitta and Kledaka
Kapha.[4] Majority (47%) of patients belonged to Pitta–Kapha
Prakriti, as Doshik predominance of disease is Pitta
Kapha, so more number of people were of this Prakriti when compared to others. These patients are prone to Amlapitta due to intake of Tikshna (spicy), Ushna (hot), Lavana (salty), Khara (rough), excessive cold and heavy foods. Nearly 60% of patients had Mrudu
Koshtha, excess Pitta in any form will have an effect on Koshtha and in this case, the Sara (mobile), Drava (liquid) Guna of Pitta, leads to Mrudu
Koshtha.

In the present study, 63% patients had emotional stress. Stress is something that stimulates our body to respond in an abnormal way. The mental stress and strain leads to irregular fluctuations in the production of gastric secretions ultimately causing damage to the gastric mucosa.[10] Vagal stimulation along with sympathetic irritation of gastric mucosa can be attributing factor for anxiety and emotional stress.[11] Data showed that aggravating factor in 17 (57%) patients was due to diet, 5 (17%) patients due to cold climate, 4 (13%) patients due to drug intake, while 3 (10%) patients by improper posture and 1 (3%) patient had occupation as aggravating factor. Intake of spicy food, Pitta Kaphavardhaka Ahara (food which aggravated Pitta and Kapha) Vitiates
Pitta, which causes Vidagdhaajirna. This in turn leads to Amlapitta. Intake of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug stimulates H2 receptors in stomach which leads to excess gastric secretions. According to Acharya
Sushruta, left lateral sleeping posture is considered as ideal posture because it helps in proper digestion and absorption of Ahara.[12] Other postures such as supine, right lateral and prone position may cause improper gastric secretions, which leads to impaired digestion. Awaking late night and untimely food intake in software engineers, watchman etc., due to their occupation leads to Vata Prakopa (vitiates aggravation of Vata) and Kapha Kshaya (decreased Kapha), which ultimately leads to Amlapitta.

Effect of Baladi Manduram on subjective parameters
Effect on Amlodgara
Amlodgara is mentioned as one of the balanced Pitta symptoms.[13] Normal Pitta has Katu
Rasa (pungent), but in Vidagdha state, it is transformed to sour taste. The sour and liquid properties of Pitta are also increased, resulting in impaired digestion, indigestion and leads to Amla/Tikta
Udgara. The significant relief in this symptom may be due to Snigdha (unctuous), Laghu (light) and Picchila Guna (lubricous property) and Katu Vipaka (post digestive effect in pungent flavour) of Bala, Shatavari, Eranda, Pippali and Chaturjataka,[14] Ama Pachana (digestion of unmetabolised food) property of Nagakeshara, Twak and Patra.[15]

Effect on Hrithkanthadaha
Hridkantha
Daha mainly occurs due to Pitta
Prakopa and Kapha
Kshaya. Significant relief in this symptom may be due to Sheeta
Guna and Sheeta
Virya of Mandura
Bhasma[16] and jaggery. Vitiated Pitta might have got normalized due to pacification of Pitta, property of Bala, Shatavari, Eranda, Yava and Guda.[17]

Effect on Utklesha
Utklesha mainly occurs because of excess Sama
Pitta with involvement of Kapha. The significant relief found in this symptom may be due to sweet, pungent, astringent taste of Mandura
Bhasma, Twak, Nagakeshara and Shatavari.[18]

Effect on Agnimandya
Statistically highly significant relief was seen in Agnimandya. This improvement may be due to Stomachic, Digestant and faecal astringent properties of Mandura
Bhasma, Pippali, Jiraka, Patra, Ela and Twak.[19]

Efeect on Avipaka
Mandagni leads to Ajirna
(Vidagdhajirna) which in turn leads to Amlapitta. The significant relief found in this symptom may be due to digestive property of Pippali, Jiraka, Nagakeshara, Twak and Ela[20] and Ama Pachana (digestion of unmetabolised food) property of Twak, Nagakeshara, Jiraka and Ela.

Effect on Gaurava
This symptom is due to Kapha
Prakopa. The significant relief found in this symptom may be due to pacification of Kapha, Lekhana (scraping) and Laghu (light) property of Mandura
Bhasma, Pippali, Jiraka and Eranda.[21]

Probable mode of action of Baladi Manduram
Evaluation of five fundamental parameters of drug (Rasa Panchaka) for Baladi
Manduram suggests that it is sweet, astringent in taste, light, rritant in nature, cool property, cooling energy of substance. It has Madhura Vipaka (sweet post digestive effect), vitiated Pitta-Kapha, Stomachic and digestive process of un-metabolised food, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Mandura Bhasma has astringent taste, dry, light, cool potential, post digestive effect in pungent flavour, Stomachic and pacifies Pitta-Kapha property. By virtue of its taste and properties, it pacifies aggravated pitta and thereby improves the digestion and metabolism. Intake of iron oxide helps in reducing the excess digestive acid secretion from the gastric mucosa.[22] Bala has Balya property (increase strength), pacifies to Vata, scraping effect and pacifies Tridosha. It has anti-inflammatory, analgesic and wound-healing properties.[23] Shatavari roots has Agni Vardhaka (digestive stimulant), Vayah-Sthapana (anti ageing), rejuvenator effect and increases strength. Research studies on Asparagus
racemosus have shown that it has antidyspepsia, antiulcerogenic and antioxidant properties.[24] Eranda roots has Ama Pachana (digestion of unmetabolized food) and aphrodisiac properties and antiulcer, anti-inflammatory, antihistaminic and antioxidant activities.[25] Yava has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.[26] Pippali and Jeeraka have Deepana, Vata–Kaphahara, aphrodisiac and rejuvenator properties and anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic and antiulcer activities.[27] Chaturjataka
(Twak, Ela, Patra and Nagakeshara) pacifies Vata-Kapha, possess Stomachic, Digestant, antihistaminic and anti-hemorrhoidal, gastroprotective, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.[28]

Due to the presence of above-mentioned properties, Baladi
Manduram helps in reducing the aggravated Pitta
Dosha, stabilizes the state of Agni, helps in Ama
Pachana (digestion of unmetabolised food), pacifies Vidagdhajirna and thereby improves digestion, absorption and assimilation, thus relieving the symptoms of Amlapitta.

Conclusion
Baladi
Manduram has provided significant results on the parameters of Amlapitta. Based on the present clinical study, it can be concluded that Baladi Manduram is an efficacious formulation for the management of Amlapitta. No adverse effects were reported during the entire study period. The present clinical trial was carried out on a limited number of patients. Hence, an extended study with more clinical parameters and on a large number of patients can be considered to find the effect treatment prevention of recurrence.
