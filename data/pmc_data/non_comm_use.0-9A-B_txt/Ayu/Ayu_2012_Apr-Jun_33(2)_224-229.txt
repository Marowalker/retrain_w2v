It is a papulo-squamous disorder of the skin, characterized by sharply defined erythemato-squamous lesions. It is chronic and is well known for its course of remissions and exacerbations. The exact etiology is still unknown. This condition is comparable with Mandala Kushtha in Ayurvedic system of medicine. Shodhana procedures are reliable to control the disease. Forty patients, fulfilling the inclusion criteria, were selected and randomly divided into four groups with 10 patients in each group. In Group A, Vamana and Virechana was administered once during the trial period. In Group B, Vamana and Virechana followed by Dermo-care in the dose of 5 g twice a day for the period of 2 months. In Group C, only Dermo-care was administered. In Group D, Tab. Neotrexate (Methotrexate) 7.5 mg/week was given under the supervision of dermatologist. Marked improvement was observed in 10% of the patients in Group B. Moderate improvement was observed in 20% of the patients in Group A, 90% in Group B, and 80% in Group D. Mild improvement was observed in 80% of the patients in Group A, 100% in Group C, and 20% in Group D.

Introduction
In Ayurveda all skin diseases are categorized under “Kushtha”. Mandala Kushtha a type of Maha Kushtha is a chronic of Kushtha. Even if it is cured relapses are common. Mandala Kushtha is stated to be Tridoshaja with the dominance of Kapha Dosha. The description and characteristic features of Mandala Kushtha are nearer to Psoriasis. Hence, Mandala Kushtha can be compared with Psoariasis.

Psoriasis is chronic and well known for its course of remissions and exacerbations. Modern medical science treats psoriasis with spiraled (P) and ultraviolet A (UVA) therapy PUVA, corticosteroids, and antimitotic drugs. But these therapies are associated with serious side effects like liver and kidney failure, bone marrow depletion, etc.[1,2]

Panchakarma therapy of Ayurveda has attracted attention of the people worldwide as it is an unique sort of treatment of various chronic, auto immune, hormonal, degenerative disorders, etc., where other sorts of treatments have no satisfactory answer. Acharya Charaka has highlighted the role of Panchakarma therapy by stating that the disease treated by Shodhana will never recur, whereas the treatment with Shamana therapy may recur in due course of time.[3]

In addition, if Shamana drugs are administered after proper course of Shodhana, then it provides additional relief and thus helps in eradicating the diseases completely.

Vamana Karma is the best measure for Kapha Dushti, whereas Virechana Karma is indicated not only for Pitta Dosha but also in Kapha and Rakta Dushti.

Jeemutaka (Luffa echinata) is selected for Vamana instead of Madana Phala (Randia spinosa) as it is specially indicated in Kushtha Roga.[4]

Considering all the above, it has been planned to evaluate comparative efficacy of Vamana, Virechana and Shamana Yoga (Dermo-care) [Table 1] in Mandala Kushtha (Psoriasis).

Materials and Methods

Criteria for assessment of results
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index[8] (PASI) score was considered for both subjective and objective parameters.

Totaling up the index
For each skin section, add up the three severity scores and multiply the total by the area score, and then multiply that result by percentage of the skin in that section.

The severity of PASI Parameters (scaling, erythema, and induration) and other parameters were assessed in the following manner.





The severity of Kandu (itching), Mandal Rupa (oval/round patches), Krodha (anger), Shoka, and Chinta (anxiety) was assessed in the following manner:

Discussion
Changes in life style, irregularities in dietary habits became major issues in current scenario and are responsible in manifesting a number of ailments. Significance of lifestyle and diet, etc., have been well recognized in Ayurvedic classics and emphasis a following the guidelines on Dinacharya, Rutucharya in eradication of various diseases can be readily observed in them.[9-14]


Deepana and Pachana
Panchakola Churna increases the Agni and then helps in Ama Pachana.

Snehana
Snehapana with Panchatikta Ghrita as a Purvakarma subsides the symptoms like Rukshata, Daha, etc., Similarities in chemical and physiological nature in Ghrita and human cell membrane intensifies the penetration of Sneha (Panchatikta Ghrita) in to deeper tissues causing partial rejuvenation of cell, smoothing of vitiated Dosha (stagnated metabolic wastes).

Vamana and Virechana
Soothened Doshas will get liquefied and reaches to Koshtha by Swedana, which can be easily eliminated by the action of Vamana and Virechana.

Thus it is clear that the toxins or nitrogenous waste materials that are collected in lower intestinal cells are removed by Virechana and thus cleansing the lower passage and rejuvenating each and every cell of lower GIT.

These Shodhana (Vamana and Virechana) probably may leads to certain endogeneous changes in the body responsible for the alleviation of psoriatic pathological process.

Dermo-care (Kalpit Yoga)
Most of these drugs have following properties – Kushthaghna, Krimighna, Rakta Shodhana, Kandughna, Amapachana, Medhya, Rasayana, Kaphaghna, Twachya, Yakriduttejaka, Agni Vardhak, and also Tridoshaghna. The synergistic actions of Tikta and Kashaya Rasa dominant herbs and minerals are likely to check the etio-pathogenesis of Mandal Kushtha (Psoriasis) and arrest its progress.

Conclusion
Vamana and Virechana along with Dermo-Care proved more effective to control erythema of leg and arm; induration of leg, torso, arm, and head; scales of leg, torso, and head; coverage area of torso and arm; Mandal Rupa and Shoka. Only Dermo-Care is more effective to control Krodha. Neotrexate (Methotrexate) is more effective to control erythema in torso and head; scales in arm; coverage area of leg and head; Kandu and Chinta. Shodhana independently have shown much better results than the patients treated with Shamana therapy (Dermo-care yoga). Neotrexate (Methotrexate) independently have shown much better results than the patients treated with Shodhana alone or Shamana therapy (Dermo-care) alone. Shodhana followed by Shamana therapy have shown better results than the patients treated with Shodhana, Shamana therapy or modern medicine alone.
