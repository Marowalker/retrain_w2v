Therefore, until a few years ago, the revival of the holistic approach, the Ayurvedic diet, and lifestyle were not being much focused. This research work was planned to evaluate the extra effects of Ayurvedic Ahara and Vihara in the management of Madhumeha and to project them socially. A total of 30 patients were selected and divided into two groups. Group A was treated with Ayurvedic Ahara and Vihara with Varadi Kwatha and group B was treated with only Varadi Kwatha for 8 weeks. The study showed highly significant results in most of the parameters in both the groups. However, further trials with increased number of patients are needed to support the current observations.

Introduction
Since a long time, Ayurveda has been emphasizing more on the importance of diet and lifestyle in the maintenance of health, according to which a healthy man is referred as “he who indulges daily in healthy diet and lifestyle activities, who discriminates between wholesome and unwholesome and acts accordingly, who is not attached too much to the worldly affairs, who develops the habit of charity, considering all as equal, is truthful, pardoning, and keeping company of good persons becomes free from diseases.”[1]

It is also said that in both the conditions, viz. health and disease, the wholesomeness and the unwholesomeness is a prime factor to be thought about, as without proper diet, the use of any drug is futile.[2]

As said earlier, the consideration of Ayurveda with lifestyle also has to be given due emphasis for the maintenance of the standards of health. In this segment, the entrainment and entertainment of the mind also plays a vital role, as no human activity takes place without the indulgence and proper setting of the mind. Hence, the planning of lifestyle in accordance with the day-to-day requirement of a person by giving due importance to the entrainment and entertainment of the mind is quite crucial.

Reviewing the current practices of diet and lifestyle including the mode of food preparation, raw materials, food combinations and food timings, timings of work and rest, types of work, the modes of entertainment and recreation, surrounding environment, Yoga such as Asanas (postures), Pranayama (bioenergy boosting techniques), Surya Namaskara (sun salutation), Agnisara (bioenergy detoxification), prayer, etc., is really in a state where it is very essential to focus if the tranquility, sanctity, and fruitfulness of human life is to be maintained.

Amongst the many dreadful conditions arising because of modern-day living, Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a giant disease considered as one of the archenemies of the humankind caused by improper diet and lifestyle. It is often referred to as a “silent killer.” Diabetes and its complications pose a major threat to public health resources throughout the world. Looking at its gravity, the World Health Organization (WHO)[3] has taken up a close vigilance and survey about this problem the world over.

The WHO's statement on primary health care program states that there is a “collective failure to deliver in line with these values which is painful and deserves our greatest attention.”[4] Also, there is “an inability of health services to deliver the level of national coverage that meets the stated demand and changing needs.”[5] This scientific holistic work inspired from Ayurveda with a special focus on diet and lifestyle [Table 1] can seriously contribute into the DM management and primary health care program.

Table 1 Special plan of Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle

Taking these facts into consideration, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle with Varadi Kwatha in Madhumeha (DM).

Table 7 Overall effect of therapies

Discussion
For Prabhuta Mutrata, in both the groups, the results [Tables 3 and 4] were statistically highly significant (P < 0.001) as Ahara and Vihara with Varadi Kwatha may help to regulate the Udakavaha and Medovaha Srotas, and thus, will have an impact on the Mutravaha Srotas. Therefore, it helps in regulating the water balancing system of the body.

With regard to Klaibya also, in both the groups, the results were highly significant (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively, in groups A and B), as the Varadi Kwatha, with lifestyle practices such as Pranayams, exercise, fasting, etc., helps in rectifying Srotorodha and, thus, generating Ruchi, Utsaha, and Bala in life and for enjoyment of sex.

The effects of the therapy on FBS and PPBS were statistically significant (P < 0.05) in groups B and A. With respect to fasting urine sugar, the result was significant (P < 0.05) in group A. This could be attributed to lifestyle modifications like Padagamanam, exercises, Asanas, fasting, etc., and the selected light diet which helped to enhance blood circulation and the metabolism of glucose, whereas in group B, the result was insignificant due to absence of Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle modifications.

The effects on the symptoms Pipasaadhikya and Galatalu Shosha were statistically highly significant (P < 0.001) in group B. Possibly, Varadi Kwatha helps to utilize the unspent glucose in the blood and relieves the accumulated Kapha and channelizes the Vayu properly due to Tikta Rasa which is Akasha and Vayu Mahabhoota. Thus, it helps to regulate the Udakavaha and Medovaha Srotas and, therefore, regulates the water balancing system of the body and mouth dryness, while in group A the result was significant as the number of patients was less.

In relation to Kshudhadhikya and Abhyavarana Shakti, the result was statistically significant in group A due to lifestyle practices like Padagamanama, exercises, Asanas, fasting, etc., and the selected light diet helps to enhance the power of Agni (metabolism), while in group B, the result was insignificant.

In Daurbalya also, the result was statistically significant in group A as the Varadi Kwatha helps to utilize the unspent glucose in the blood to release energy. The Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle treatment as mentioned above helps to regulate the Agni. The Pranayamas have helped in increasing the energy level by enhancing the Agni (metabolic activities) and Prana (bio energy) thus enhancing Bala (energy). The lifestyle schedule through Asanas relieves the accumulated Kapha and channelizes the Vayu properly.

In Shrama Shwasa, the results obtained were highly significant and significant in group A and group B, respectively. This was due to the effect of Varadi Kwatha in both the groups as it is Tikta (bitter) and Kashaya Rasa (astringent taste) predominantly with Kaphaghna property, which is expected to clear the Pranavahasrotasas (channels carrying the prana). The Pranayama in group A helps to strengthen the respiratory organs and Vyayama helps to systematically strengthen the body capacity; therefore, the result was highly significant in group A.

In the symptom Shula, the results obtained were significant and highly significant in group A and group B, respectively. In patients of Madhumeha, Shula occurs due to craving and lack of glucose entry to the body tissues. In this case, Varadi Kwatha, being predominantly Tikta and Kashaya Rasa and Kaphagna property is expected to clear the srotasas (channels) and facilitates the entry of glucose (nutrition) to generate Bala (vitality) and curbs Shula (tissue damage) and Suptata.

The results obtained were significant and highly significant in group A and group B, respectively, in Alasya with Utsahahani because the Tikta and Kashaya Rasa with Laghu and Ruksha Gunas of Varadi Kwatha in both the groups relieve the accumulated Kapha, channelize the Vayu properly, and rectify the Alasya of whole body and mind. The lifestyle program including Asanas, Pranayama, and listening to Mantras helped in regaining the physical, mental, and spiritual health of the patients in group A.

In Purishabadhdata, the results obtained were significant and highly significant in group A and group B, respectively, as Haritaki in Varadi Kwatha has Anulomanaka nature, thus facilitating the bowel evacuation.

In group A, the extra treatment through Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle treatment relieved the accumulated Kapha, rectified Guruta and Snigdhata, and channelized the Vayu properly with enhancement in Agni Bala, and therefore, significant results were obtained in HDL cholesterol, while in group B, the result was insignificant.

The effect on HbA1c in group A was statistically significant (P < 0.05) as the treatment techniques through lifestyle changes like Padagamanama, exercises, Asanas, fasting, etc., and the selected diet plan helped to enhance blood circulation and the metabolism of glucose, while in group B, this test was not done.

In group B, the results obtained in the symptoms like Daurblaya, Shrama Shwasa, Shula, Alasya with Utsahahani were highly significant as compared to the results observed in group A due to more number of patients.

Conclusion
The specially prepared Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle plan in the present study has all the potential to be used as a standard Ayurvedic model protocol for Madhumeha (DM) patients. According to the effect of therapy, Varadi Kwatha with Ayurvedic Ahara and Vihara (group A) has proved to be a better remedy than only Varadi Kwatha (group B) by relieving most of the cardinal symptoms as well as improving the biochemical parameters. Thus, it can be used to help to correct the condition of Madhumeha (DM). The effect of Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle plan along with Varadi Kwatha can be further studied on a large number of patients to substantiate the results of the present study.
