In the era of modernization, why should Ayurveda lag behind in meeting the demands of the ever-changing science? Keeping this in mind, AYU, the journal being published since the last three decades, and getting continuous updates, is made online. The first online issue was published on August 7 this year. Since then, it has got tremendous response and a warm welcome from all levels of the medical society, for which we are deeply indebted. The acceptance rate for AYU online has reached to significant extent within 2 months and it has been indexed in Caspur, EBSCO, OpenJGate, Primocentral, ProQuest, SCOLOAR and SIIC database. The revolution came with the help of Medknow Publication, Mumbai, which transformed AYU in both the print as well as the online forms, giving it a new face and attracting many international readers towards Ayurveda.

The manuscript submission and peer review have also been made online, but Ayurvedic authors and reviewers need to become more tech savvy to adopt the electronic system totally, although the online form of AYU has attracted many modern researchers working on Ayurveda to submit their valuable researches on this platform. The online AYU is inviting all the scientists globally to publish their researches in the field of Ayurveda so as to provide the time-tested traditional Indian medicine a solid, evidence-based scientific platform. The online system has reduced the time required for submission and review, leading to faster publication.

Research is a continuous process and regular review and updates are essential for the growth and development of any science to become rich. In this regard, journals play an important role as a platform for these updates. AYU requests eminent scientists to contribute to the development of Ayurveda through their opinions on the published articles so that new guidelines can be laid down for further researches. Also, most importantly, the articles are to be cited, which proves their authenticity. All authors are urged to refer and cite more articles from all Ayurvedic journals in order to improve the status of Ayurvedic journals on the international platform.

The present second issue of AYU is the most content-rich issue, with many high-quality research papers from eminent Ayurvedic and non-Ayurvedic personalities and scholars. The first two articles in this issue from Prof. Hari Sharma and Dr. Anila Kumar answer long-going queries about the use of Ghee and Honey in Ayurveda. The next article from Dr. Mane and Dr. Dwivedi represents a unique experimental attempt to validate Gunas in terms of modern science. The article by Dr. A. K. Tripathi gives a view towards the antidepressant effect of Vacha. In review, we have included two important topics, i.e. infertility and procreative factors in Stri Roga and Prasuti Tantra. The other two articles review herbs on the urinary system and the most interesting topic of psychologists, i.e. dreams in Indian classics. The clinical researches include challenging topics for Ayurveda, like chronic renal failure, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, depression from Kayachikitsa (internal medicine), Arsha and Agnikarma from Shalya Tantra (surgery), computer vision syndrome and dental caries from Shalakya Tantra (opthalmology and dentistry). In view of Ayurvedic Drug Standardization, four articles on Kuberaksha, Jwarahara Dashemani, Rasaka Bhasma and Langali are included. Thus, the issue is enriched with various researches comprising articles from all eight specialities of Ayurveda, which is a unique feature of AYU. We hope that this issue will help all the recipients to enrich their knowledge of Ayurveda and contribute to the science. May this knowledge enlighten the candle of wisdom and remove the darkness of ignorance.
