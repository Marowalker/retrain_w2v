Sir,

The recent report on water purification is interesting.[1] The use of “flowers” according to Ayurveda concept is interesting and further studies to verify the technique is useful. In addition to the proposed chemical and microbiological study, there are some other points that should be considered. First, changes in the physical properties of water should also be focused. Second, the use of flowers might not be applicable in some situations such as the cases with flower (pollen) allergy.[2]
