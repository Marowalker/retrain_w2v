Dear Editor,

We read the publication on “A clinical study to evaluate the role of Triphaladya Guggulu along with Punarnavadi Kashaya (decoction) in the management of hypothyroidism” with great interest.[1] Sing and Thakar noted that “Triphaladya Guggulu and Punarnavadi decoction are effective in the management of hypothyroidism.”[1] In fact, the classical alternative medicine is widely reported for its usefulness in the management of thyroid problem. However, there are still important concerns.First, the control of the dosage of the drug is important, and this is an important issue for further research. The excessive contamination of the Chinese herbal product is recently reported for causing thyroid problem.[2] In addition, although it is rare, some herbs are reported for the association with thyroid neoplasm.[3] Finally, the interpretation of the thyroid function test in the clinical study of the herbal extract needs consideration of the possible interference of the herbs on laboratory analysis. The interference on immunoassay, including the assay for thyroid function test, is possible.[4] It is no doubt that further research to evaluate effectiveness and safety of the Triphaladya Guggulu and Punarnavadi decoction for the management of thyroid disorder is necessary.
