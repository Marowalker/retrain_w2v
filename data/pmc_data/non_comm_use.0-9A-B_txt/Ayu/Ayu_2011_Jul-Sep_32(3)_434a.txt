Sir,

The recent publication on Vamana procedure is very interesting.[1] Gupta et al. analyzed vomitus macroscopically, microscopically, and chemically.[1] There are some concerns on this work. The number of subjects is too small; hence, the work can be only a preliminary report with limitation for further implication. The analysis of vomitus lacks for standard laboratory quality control and this can be a big defect. Also, several factors can affect the vomitus characteristics including to the ingested food and pathological abnormality of upper gastrointestinal tract.
