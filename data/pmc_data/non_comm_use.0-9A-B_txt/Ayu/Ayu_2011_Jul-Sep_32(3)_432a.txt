Sir,

The recent publication on Mehamudgaravati and type 2 diabetes mellitus is very interesting.[1] Tanna et al., concluded that this drug is useful due to “its known hypolipidemic, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, antihyperglycemic, antistress, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities.[1] ” I have some comments on this work. First, the authors tried to investigate on some parameters. Many parameters are subjective and can be biased. Focussing on laboratory investigation, there is no quality control information. The simple fasting blood sugar can be affected by several interferences and a single measurement might not be a reliable parameter for decision on improvement of diabetes mellitus. Finally, the authors did not investigate on lipid, antioxidant and immunity; hence, the conclusion on those aspects cannot be made.
