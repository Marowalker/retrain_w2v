In India, health care sector has expanded well during post-independence period by duly including various medical systems like Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and Homeopathy to cater the needs of the ailing humanity. The World Health Organization (WHO) focused on the role of traditional systems in primary health care programs during International Conference on Primary Health Care conducted at Alma Ata in the year 1978.[1] Prof. K. N. Udupa (BHU) has taken initiative to list out diseases like non-ulcer dyspepsia, peptic ulcer, piles, worm infestations, bronchial asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, viral hepatitis, anemia, and common skin and gynecological disorders, wherein Ayurveda can play a key role in their management at primary health care level. Scientific validation produced about certain Ayurvedic drugs has drawn the attention of the WHO to sponsor certain research projects as well as national and international conferences of Ayurveda in the country.

The first ever study of the Ayurvedic system sponsored by the WHO was conducted in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Ayurvedic trust, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India from 1977 to 1984. This unblinded longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Ayurvedic treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in in-patients.[2]

Institute for Postgraduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (IPGT and RA), one of the premier institutes for Ayurvedic research and education, started providing training to the WHO-sponsored fellows from various countries. Many new courses have been designed exclusively for foreign nationals. Scientists and scholars from countries like Canada, Germany, France, Poland, England, Switzerland, the Netherlands, USA, Russia, Australia, Vietnam, Japan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan, etc., have visited the institute to receive training in various specialties of Ayurveda.

In view of various successfully completed research projects and publications of research communications in many national and international journals, the WHO has recognized IPGT and RA, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar as one of the foremost collaborative centers for traditional medicine (Ayurveda). The institute drafted terms of references that are to be focused during the period of collaboration.


Rationalization and standardization of health promotion guidelines of Ayurveda

Development of standard Ayurveda treatment protocols for lifestyle disorders

Organization of orientation training programs for foreign and national medical professionals and WHO fellows and officials on scientific aspects and evidence-based uses of Ayurveda

Development of a base paper for regional consultation on enhancing communication between traditional medicine practitioners and modern medicine practitioners

Development of strategic measures and capacity building program for strengthening of pharmacovigilance of traditional medicines.




WHO collaboration center is another feather in the cap of IPGT and RA, which is actively involved in Ayurvedic research and education for a period of more than five decades. Hope some more WHO collaborative centers would come up at other institutes also to strengthen Ayurveda.

The current issue includes review articles dealing with the concepts of Darshanika view of Satkaryavada and recitation of Charakasamhita as per Chhandasastra. Clinical observations about the role of drugs and Panchakarma procedure in the management of Mutra Krichra (stricture urethra) are reported in original clinical articles. Among the articles of pharmacological studies, observations of the effect of Lekhanavasti on lipid profiles in rats and the analgesic activity of Nelsonia. C. is quite interesting. A case study related to data of pharmacovigilance is also included in this issue.
