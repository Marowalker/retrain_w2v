It exacerbates a large number of health-related problems, both independently and in association with other diseases. Therefore, this study was carried out at PG Hospital, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar to evaluate effect of Agnimanthadi compound in the patients of Sthaulya. For this purpose 83 patients of Sthaulya were selected out of which 15 patients were dropped out. Remaining 68 patients were treated in two groups. Among these, 38 patients of Sthaulya were treated with Agnimanthadi compound administered orally in the dose of four capsules of 500 mg three times a day with lukewarm water before meal. Remaining 30 patients of Sthaulya were kept as placebo control and were administered orally two placebo capsules of 500 mg filled with starch, three times a day with lukewarm water before meal. The duration of the treatment in both the groups was 7 weeks with follow-up for 2 months. Analysis of overall effects of both the groups showed that Agnimanthadi compound provided markedly better reduction in weight, BMI and other signs and symptoms in the patients of obesity in comparison to the control group.

Introduction
Sthaulya is included under eight undesirable conditions (Ashtau Nindita),[1] Shleshma Nanatmaja,[2] Samtarpana Nimittaja,[3] Atinindita,[4] Ati Brihmana Nimittaja[5] and Bahu Dosha Janita[6] Vikara. Moreover Sushruta has emphasized on metabolic disturbances (Dhatvaagnimandya) in the etiopathogenesis of Sthaulya.[7] The patient of Sthaulya exhibits very strange phenomenon. Their appetite is excessive[8] and whatever they eat is quickly digested, which indicates hyperfunctioning of the Jatharaagni. Besides this, the patient suffers from laziness, may be due to under supply of energy, which may be due to hypofunctioning of Bhutaagni. Further Dhatvaagni also seems to be disturbed, as in Sthaulya patient mainly Medo-Dhatu is formed and there is deficiency of other Dhatu.[9] Hence, it can be inferred that in Sthaulya, Jatharaagni is Tikshna, Bhutaagni is Manda and Dhatvaagni is disturbed in their respective functions. On the basis of the above-mentioned facts of pathogenesis of Sthaulya, it can be said that the drug, which decreases Jatharaagni particularly Abhyavaharana Shakti, increases Bhutaagni and corrects the functions of Dhatvaagni and at the same time have Medo-hara, Kapha-hara and Vatahara actions, may be suitable for its management.

Taking all the above mentioned facts in consideration, Agnimanthadi compound comprising of Agnimantha, Mustaka, Gomutra and Eranda Patra Kshara was formulated for the present study. Most of these drugs are indicated in the treatment of Sthaulya in Ayurvedic classics.[10]

Agnimantha (Clerodendrum phlomidis (Burm.f.) Kuntze) is Dipana, Pachana, Kaphaghna, Shothahara and is having Vata-Kapha Hara properties.[11] Its antidiabetic action[12] is also reported which may be due to its action at the level of Bhutaagni and Dhatvaagni. Mustaka (Cyperus rotundus Linn) has Dipana, Pachana, Lekhana, Mutrala and Pitta Shamaka actions.[13] To make both drugs more Tikshna, seven Bhavana of Gomutra were given. Gomutra is Tikshna, Ushna and Agni-Dipaka in action[14] and has Kapha Vata Nashaka properties. It is also indicated in the treatment of Sthaulya by Sushruta.[7]

In clinical practice it is observed that Agnimantha produces burning sensation. Hence, Eranda (Ricinus communis Linn) Patra Kshara was added in the compound, which is reported to have Kapha Nashaka, Medohara, Dipana and Pachana actions.[15]

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of Agnimanthadi compound in the management of Sthaulya (obesity)




Materials and Methods
The 83 patients of Sthaulya (obesity) attending the OPD and IPD of PG Hospital, IPGT and RA, Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar were registered for this study. Out of these, 15 patients were dropped out and 68 patients completed the prescribed course of the treatment.

Criteria of diagnosis
The diagnosis was mainly based on the clinical presentation as mentioned in the Ayurveda texts as well as Allopathic texts along with body mass index (BMI). A detailed proforma incorporating all the clinical aspects mentioned for Sthaulya/obesity was prepared accordingly, detailed clinical history was taken and physical examination was done.

Criteria for selection of patients
Patients in the age group of 16-65 years were selected for the present study. Other criteria for inclusion was as follow:

Subjective criteria

Patients having clinical presentation of Sthaulaya (obesity) as mentioned in the Ayurveda texts as well as allopathic texts.




Objective criteria

For the present study BMI more than 30 was taken for considering the patients as obese and the patients having BMI 30-45 were included for the present study.




BMI calculated on the basis of height and weight of each patient, Standard range of normal body weight in relation to height mentioned by Life Insurance Corporation of India was adopted. An international criterion for BMI was used to calculate the BMI by the following formula:

BMI = weight (in kg)/Height (in meter).

Exclusion criteria

Patients in the age group of less than 16 years and more than 65 years were not included for the present study.

Obese patients suffering from hypothyroidism, obesity due to hormonal imbalance, cardiovascular diseases, hemiplegia, associated with severe hypertension and from other such diseases in which the patient cannot do his routine physical activities were excluded.

Very obese patients having BMI more than 45 were excluded from the present study.




Investigations

Lipid profile was carried out approximately in all the patients before and after the study and fasting blood sugar was carried out in suspected cases only.




Other examination and tests

Weight was recorded before starting the treatment and later on every week of the study. Weight was also recorded of all the patients who have come for the follow-up study.

Circumferences of fatty parts were recorded before and thereafter every week, till the completion of the course of treatment, to assess the effect of therapy.

The effectiveness of therapy on body fat was assessed by measuring the skin fold thickness by vernier calipers before and after the treatment in particular areas of middle portions of the biceps and triceps muscles, middle portion of the suprailiac region and the anterior surface of mid-thigh region and of abdominal muscle at umbilicus.

Walking time: The time taken to climb fixed number of stairs in seconds was taken as walking time.




Groups division and treatment
Eighty-three patients of Sthaulya were registered for this study and were divided into two groups’ viz. Placebo control group and Agnimanthadi group. Out of which 15 patients were dropped out and 68 patients of Sthaulya completed the full-course of the treatment and their details were as follow:

Out of 68 patients of Sthaulya who completed the full-course of the treatment 30 patients were treated in the placebo control group and 38 patients were treated in Agnimanthadi group. This difference in number of patients in both the groups was due to more dropouts in the control group.

(1) Control (C) Group: The patients of this group were given two placebo capsules three times a day with lukewarm water before meal for seven weeks. Each capsule was filled with 500 mg of starch.

(2) Agnimanthadi (A) Group: Patients of this group were administered Agnimanthadi compound in the dose of 2 g (four capsules of 500 mg) three times a day with lukewarm water before meal for a period of 7 weeks.

Method of preparation of drug
Agnimanthadi compound comprises of four drugs namely Agnimantha, Mustaka, Eranda Patra Kshara and Gomutra. First of all, fine powders of Agnimantha and Mustaka were taken in equal quantity. The mixture of these two powders was given seven Bhavanas of Gomutra and at the end Eranda Patra Kshara was added to it. Sixteen parts of Gomutra Bhavita Agnimantha and Mustaka was added to the one part of Eranda Patra Kshara. This compound was filled in the capsules.

Duration of treatment
Duration of treatment for both the groups was 7 weeks.

Criteria of assessment
The effect of therapy was assessed on the basis of the following subjective as well as objective criteria.

Subjective criteria
A multidimensional scoring pattern was adopted for the sign and symptoms of Sthaulya mentioned in Ayurvedic texts. The score of symptom was assessed before and after the treatment and statistical analysis was undertaken. Apart from cardinal sign and symptom other signs and symptoms were also assessed. This assessment was done before starting the treatment and thereafter every week till completion of seven week course of therapy. The paired ‘t’ test was applied for the statistical analysis of the results. Moreover assessment of Dosha, Dushya, Srotasa based on their dominant symptoms was also carried out.

Objective criteria
For objective criteria above mentioned parameters mentioned under the heading of investigations and examination and tests were taken into consideration.

Assessment of overall effect of the therapy
For the overall assessment of the therapy following eight categories were taken into consideration:


Complete remission: 100% relief in the signs and symptoms, along with reduction in body weight up to normal range, for that particular height in comparison of age, was considered as complete remission.

Marked improvement: More than 75% improvement noted in signs and symptoms, along with more than 75% weight reduction, was considered as markedly improved.

Moderate improvement: Fifty to 75% improvement was noted in the sign and symptoms along with more then 50% weight reduction was considered as moderate improvement.

Improvement: If 25-50% improvement was noted in the sign and symptoms along with more then 25% weight reduction, then it was considered as improvement.

Slight improvement: Less than 25% relief in sign and symptoms along with less than 25% weight reduction was considered as slight improvement.

Unchanged: No effect in sign and symptoms along with no change in weight was considered as unchanged.

Deterioration: Increase in signs and symptoms or appearance of new symptoms or increase in weight was considered as deterioration.

Change of score: If improvement was noted in sign and symptoms, but no improvement or mild increase of weight was recorded, then one step down improvement was assigned. Same was followed vice-versa.




Follow-up study
After completion of due course of treatment, all the patients were asked to report for follow-up study for the period of 2 months.

Discussion
In the present series, 83 patients fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of Sthaulya were selected. Out of which 15 patients had left the treatment at different stages. The remaining 68 patients completed full course of treatment for the period of 7 weeks, out of which 30 patients were in placebo control group and 38 patients were in Agnimanthadi compound group.

Comparison of the results of both the groups showed that Agnimanthadi compound provided better relief to the patients of Sthaulya than control group in the symptoms of Utsaha Hani, Anga Gaurava, Nindradhikya, Gatra Sada, Snigdha Angata and Sveda Abadha; and Dushti Lakshana of Annavaha Srotasa and Rasavaha Srotasa.

Agnimanthadi compound also imparted comparatively better and significant reduction [Table 1] in the body weight and BMI in comparison to the control group. It also showed comparatively better reduction on all circumferences of fatty parts of the body [Table 9] viz. biceps SFM, triceps SFM, suprailiac SFM and total SFM [Table 7], walking time [Table 6], pulse rate [Table 3] and diastolic blood pressure [Table 4].

It also provided comparatively better relief in serum cholesterol, serum LDL and serum LDLC/HDLC Ratio [Table 5].

On the other hand control group provided better relief in comparison to Agnimanthadi compound only in the two symptoms [Table 14] viz. Daurbalayta and Ayasena Shvasa. It also provided better effect on serum LDLC/HDLC ratio and serum TC/HDLC ratio [Table 15].

Comparison of the overall effects of the therapies
Agnimanthadi compound provided better improvement in overall signs and symptoms and laboratory findings related to Sthaulya in comparison to the Control group [Table 11 and 15] [Figure 3].

Figure 3 Overall effect of the therapies on the 68 patients of Sthaulya

The results of the follow-up study showed, highly significant reduction (P < 0.001) in body weight in one month follow-up [Table 13]. But, this significant reduction was not sustained in the second month of follow-up study [Table 13]. On the other hand no such effect was noticed in Placebo group at the follow-up study [Table 16].

Table 16 Follow-up study of the patients of Sthaulya in control group
