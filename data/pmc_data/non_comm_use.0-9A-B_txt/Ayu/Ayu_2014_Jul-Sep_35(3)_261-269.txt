Increasing morbidity and mortality of Asthma placed it among the most dreaded diseases. Prediction says that asthma along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease become third leading cause of death by the year 2020. Despite the availability of a wide range of antiasthmatic drugs, incidence of asthma is increasing alarmingly because the relief offered by these drugs is mainly symptomatic and short-lived. Moreover, their side effects are also quite distressing. Hence, a continuous search is needed to identify effective and safe remedies to treat bronchial asthma.

Aims:
The present clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Shirishadi Polyherbal compound (given through nebulizer in Aerosol form) in the management of acute and chronic uncomplicated Bronchial Asthma and to propose a novel and safer Ayurvedic treatment modality.

Methods and Materials:
It is a randomized, open, control clinical trial in which the effect of the drug was compared with contemporary treatment and placebo medication (normal saline) in 60 adults with mild to moderate asthma.

Results:
There was a (t>0.001) found in pulmonary function tests (including FEV1, FVC and PEFR)in the group treated with polyherbal drug. Improvement remain constant in consecutive follow-ups signifies that there is no reverse broncho-constriction after discontinuation of the drug.

Conclusion:
This study signifies that polyherbal drug - Shirishadi compound may prove beneficial future alternative remedy for asthma, and its effect is similar to that of modern contemporary drug when given through nasal route.

Introduction
Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to person.[1] WHO estimates show that 300 million people currently suffer from asthma. Asthma deaths will increase in the next 10 years if urgent action is not taken.[2] Asthma cannot be cured, but proper diagnosis, treatment and patient education can result in good asthma control and management. Asthma occurs in all countries regardless of level of development. Over 80% of asthma deaths occur in low and lower-middle income countries. For effective control, it is essential to make medications affordable and available, especially for low-income families.[34]

On the basis of similar clinical features, Bronchial Asthma can be correlated with Tamaka Shwasa, a disease described under the heading of five types of Shwasa in Ayurvedic classics. According to Ayurveda Shwasa is a Kapha-Vataja disease, which is originated from Pittasthana.[5] According to Ayurveda, formation of Ama is the seed for the development of future disease. The acute attack of disease appears whenever there is an obstruction of the normal passage of Pranavayu. Once the obstruction is removed, and Vayu start travelling in its normal path symptom, (breathlessness, cough etc.,) are abolished. Considering the Ayurvedic concept of treatment of Tamaka Shwasa it was decided to select an herbal Preparation “Shirishadi compound” for the management of bronchial asthma. The drug was decided to be given through nasal route followed by oral administration of the drug.

Administration of the drug through nasal route is known as Nasya in Ayurveda.[6] Ayurveda emphasis more on Nasal delivery of drug in diseases related to Shira and Pranavaha Srotasa. The channels carrying Pranavayu are known as Pranavaha Srotasa, vitiation of Pranavaha Srotasa cause Shwasa (dyspnea). In the present trial, Nasal route of drug administration and its efficacy in the acute attack was assessed and compared with that of contemporary modern medicine. Desired to make some Ayurvedic preparation which is effective in controlling the acute attack of Asthma, having least toxic side effects, and efficacy equivalent to that of modern medicine inspire to plan the present research work.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of drug: Shirishadi compound
The plants Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth., Cyperus rotundus Linn., and Solanum xanthocarpum Schrad and Wendl. were collected from the local market of Varanasi in equal quantity [Table 1]. Hydroalcoholic extraction (distilled water: ethanol = 2:1) of drugs was carried out by hot percolation method through Soxhlet apparatus. Thereafter, extracts were dried using a rotatory evaporator, and dried extract was again diluted to prepare a homogenous concentration of drug (1 mg/ml). Standardization of drug was done by using physical characterization, thin layer chromatography, and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis.

Discussion
The clinical studies on subjective, objective, and laboratory parameters have revealed that patients treated with Duoline and Budecort Nebulizer had shown significant improvement initially but after prolonged use the progress become constant along with the drug dependence. Moreover, patients treated with Budecort showed some side effects such as leg cramps, dizziness, palpitation, acidity, and nervousness. The most striking fact observed in patients treated with modern medicine was a high rate of recurrence in symptoms. After completion of the course of medicine, patient gets the symptom of the disease reappeared within 10–15 days. Moreover, no improvement was observed in recurrence of the attack on exposure to allergens.

In the patients of bronchial asthma, treated with Ayurvedic nebulizer statistically significant improvement on various parameters was recorded after the course of the therapy. The patients showed faster relief in symptoms with no apparent toxic effects. The improvement in pulmonary function remained constant even after 1-month of discontinuation of drugs, that is, there was no rebound broncho-constriction. There was ≥20% improvement in PEER, measured just after the administration of the drug. The group treated with Ayurvedic medicine showed significant improvement in PFT evidenced by marked increase in FEV1, FVC and PEFR.

According to Acaraya Charaka Shirisha (A. lebbeck) is best Vishaghna that is, it is best antitoxin. It is selected for its Vishaghna property. Acharya Charaka told that the indigested food act as a toxin in the body (Amavisha).[7] Shirisha is known for having antiallergic,[8] antihistaminic and mast cell stabilizing properties[9] anti-inflammatory[1011] and antioxidant[12] activity for which it is selected. Nagarmotha (C. rotundus) is known as best Samgrahaka, Deepana, and Pachana drug.[13] It is also known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.[1415] Kantakari (S. xanthocarpum) is a potent drug used in the ailment of Pranavaha Srotas Dusti (Shwasa, Kasa). It has potent bronchodilator effect[16] with antimicrobial[17] and anti-inflammatory[1819] properties. Shirishadi compound is mainly selected to evaluate the anti-allergic property of the drug and its action in atopic asthma and according to Ayurveda it is supposed to act on Rasagata Ama, increase the Rasagni.

As there was no significant change found in patients treated with normal saline, it can be said the effect produced by Ayurvedic drug was existent and not apparent or placebo effect. Reduction in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and eosinophil count was more prominent when the drugs was given through oral route than nasal administration of drug, suggesting that systemic effect of the drugs was more effective when given through oral route.[20]

Conclusion
It can be concluded that polyherbal compound Shirishadi has potent antiasthmatic activity. It can be further concluded that this polyherbal compound can be used as “Therapeutic Agents” in the management of an acute attack of asthma as well as chronic persistent asthma. The trial gives a direction for searching new route of herbal drug administration. In spite of limitations, the present study conducted entirely from the new angle. The study has yielded several useful observations and result which would definitely open new vistas for the future research workers of Ayurveda in general and respiratory disorders as particular.
