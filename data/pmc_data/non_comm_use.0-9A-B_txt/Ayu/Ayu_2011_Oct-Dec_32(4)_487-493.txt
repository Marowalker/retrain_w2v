In the present clinical practice Madanaphala (Randia dumetorum) is mainly used for Vamana Karma. Apart from Madanaphala, five other drugs, and in total 355 formulations are described in Charaka Samhita; one of them is Krutavedhana (Luffa acutangula) kalpa (formulations). Krutavedhana is specially indicated in Gadha (compact) Dosha condition like Kushtha (skin diseases), Garavisha (slow poison), and so on, for Vamana Karma. The present study aimed to observe the effect on Vamana Karma and by that its effect on Ekakushtha (Psoriasis). Krutavedhana Beeja Churna (seed powder) was given with Madhu (honey) and Saindhava (rock salt) as Vamana Yoga (emetic formulation), to compare it with Madanaphala Pippali Churna (seed powder). After the Sansarjana Krama (special dietetic schedule), Panchatikta Ghrita (medicated ghee) was given as Shamana Sneha (pacifying oleation). An average dose of Krutavedhana was 5.9 g. Krutavedhana could produce a good number of Vega (bouts), Pittanta Lakshana (bile coming out at the end of Vamana), and Pravara Shuddhi (maximum cleansing) in a majority of patients. Madanaphala is the best among all Vamaka (emetic) drugs, but Krutavedhana showed a similar to higher effect on Vamana Karma in terms of Antiki, Maniki, Vaigiki, and Laingiki
Shuddhi (cleansing criteria). Vamana Karma by Krutavedhana showed better relief in Matsyashakalopamam (silvery scale), Kandu (itching), and Rukshataa (dryness), while Madanapahala showed better relief in Krishnaruna Varna (erythema). After completion of the Shamana (pacifying) treatment, both the groups showed nearly the same effect on Asvedanam (lack of perspiration), Matsyashakalopamam, Kandu, Rukshataa, Krishnaruna Varna, and Mahaavaastu (bigger lesion).

Introduction
Panchakarma, the unique therapies of Ayurveda, attract the attention of people for the treatment of various disorders and also for their preventive and promotive effect. With increase of awareness and global acceptance, it is the need of the hour to work on individual Karma, with different formulations for different diseases, in a scientific manner. Therefore, in the present study Vamana Karma has been selected for the treatment of Ekakushtha (psoriasis). Vamana Karma is the best therapy[1] for the elimination of vitiated Kapha Dosha from all over the body through Aamashaya (stomach) by means of medically induced vomiting.

For the Vamana Karma, mainly Madanaphala is widely used, and the other Vamaka drugs and their formulations are not in usual practice. Apart from Madanaphala, five other drugs and in total 355 formulations are described in Charaka Samhita,[2] one of them is Krutavedhana Kalpa, which indicates the selection of different drugs and formulations in accordance to the Dosha, Dushya (tissues), and disease. Krutavedhana is specifically mentioned for a Gadha Dosha condition, like Kushtha, Pandu (anemia), Pliha Roga (splenomegaly), Shopha (edema), Gara Visha,[3] and so on. Ekakushtha has been taken for present study. Ekakushtha is one among the Kshudra Kushtha (minor skin diseases) with the dominance of Kapha and Vata Dosha in particular, and the Rakta (blood) is vitiated in general. Ekakushtha can be co-related with psoriasis. Thus, in the present study Vamana Karma has been conducted by Madanaphala and Krutavedhana in the patients of psoriasis.

Aims and objectives

To assess the effect of Krutavedhana on Vamana Karma

To compare the effect of Madanaphala Pippali and Krutavedhana
Yoga on Vamana Karma

To compare the effect of Vamana Karma performed by Madanaphala Pippali and Krutavedhana on the alleviation of the signs and symptoms of psoriasis.




Materials and Methods
The patients having classical signs and symptoms of Ekakushtha (psoriasis), as described in Bruhatrayi, were selected. A special proforma including all the etiological factors of Kushtha with Dushti Lakshana (signs and symptoms of vitiation) of Dosha, Dushya, Srotasa (channels), and so on, was designed for assessment of all the patients. The patients were thoroughly questioned and examined on the basis of the proforma. Ethical clearance and informed consent were obtained before conducting the trial.

Selection of patients
Patients suffering from Ekakushtha were selected from the Outpatient Department (OPD) and the Inpatient Department (IPD) of the I.P.G.T. and R.A., Hospital, Jamnagar, irrespective of religion, sex, occupation, caste, and so forth.

Discussion
Disease
Mahavastu, Matsyashakalopam, Krishna Aruna Varna, Kandu, and Rukshata were found in 100% of the patients, which clearly indicates the similarity of Ekakushtha with psoriasis. Although Ekakushtha is considered as Kshudra Kushtha, in the present senerio psoriasis is one of the severe skin diseases, which is Krichhra Saadhya in the treatment.

Nidanas and Samprapti observed in the present study: Nidanas like Shita-Ushna Vyatyasa Sevana, Stress, Bija Dosha (genetic factor), and Environment may lead to Dhatu Shaithilyata (laxity of the tissues) in Twak, Rakta, Mamsa (muscular tissue), Lasika (fluid and lymph). Viruddha Aahara, that is, milk + Khichadi, fast food, curd, and Maamsa Sevana (meat intake) and Divaswapna also leads to vitiation of Kapha and Rakta. These vitiated Doshas reach the Dushya like Twak and so on, and result in Sthana Samshraya Avastha (accumulation at the site of the lesion) and then produce symptoms of Ekakushtha.[7]

Drug
The drug Krutavedhana was taken for the study of Vamana Karma. There is no specific reference in the classics regarding the part of Krutavedhana that has to be used for Vamana Karma. One reference was found in Nighantu Aadarsha, regarding the use of its Beeja, and its dose is 20 to 30 grains (125 mg). Based on this, Krutavedhana Beeja Churna was selected for Vamana Karma in the present study. As per classical reference, it was given with Saindhava and Madhu, with the Anupana (vehicle) of Yashtimadhu Phaanta.

Vamana Karma
Dose of Vamana Yoga - Average dose of Madanaphala was 6 g and the average dose of Krutavedhana was 5.9 g. Dose should be given according to the Bala (strength), Prakriti, Dosha, and Koshtha of the patient.

The dose of Madanaphala may be taken at 6, 7, and 8 g for Mridu, Madhyama, and Krura Koshtha (soft, moderate, and hard bowel), respectively. The dose of Krutavedhana may be taken at 5, 6 and 7 g for Mridu, Madhyama, and Krura Koshtha, respectively.

Vaigiki (based on the number of bouts)
Time of First Vega - 12 minutes (Avg.) was taken for induction of the first Vega in Group A, while it was 15.4 minutes (Avg.) in Group B. This indicates that Krutavedhana took more time for induction of Vamana Vega.

Self-induced and projectile Vega was the main quality expected in the first Vega of Vamana Karma, which was found in 50% of the patients with Krutavedhana. It might be because it had more Tikshana and Vamaka Prabhava (strong emetic property).

More Vega induced by Krutavedhana and more Upavega induced by Madanaphala was observed. Although Vega depends on many things like, patient's intake, cooperation, Satva, and so on, from this data it can be stated that Krutavedhana produces more Vega in comparison to Madanaphala.

Maniki (based on quantity)
As per the Maniki criteria Hina Shuddhi (mild cleansing) was observed in Group A and even Hina Shuddhi was not observed in Group B. Practically the difference in output and input was not found to be more than 500 ml, which is the lower side of Hina Shuddhi as per the Maniki criteria.

Antiki (based on end point)
The clear greenish yellow Pitta that appeared in both the groups was nearly the same. Clear Pittanta may not be possible in all patients. Pittanta Lakshana is an indirect method to observe the Pitta Nirgamana (expulsion of bile). It was little more in Group B, may be because of more Vega observed in this group.

Laingiki (based on sigs and symptoms)
Samyaka Vamita Lakshanas indicate the process of Vamana and the subjective feeling of the patients after Vamana Karma. It was observed to be slightly more in Group B, may be because of the greater number of Vega and Pittanta Lakshana.

Pravara Shuddhi was observed in 53.84% of the patients in Group A, while it was 71.42% in Group B. Shuddhi depends upon the Antiki, Maniki, Laingiki, and Vaigiki criteria. By this, it can be stated that Krutavedhana may produce better Vamana Karma in comparison to Madanaphala.

Effect of therapy after Vamana Karma on chief symptoms
After the Vamana Karma, Group B showed better relief in Matsyashakalopam, Kandu, and Rukshata, because Krutavedhana was ‘Atyartha Katu Tikshnoshna’[8] (excessive pungent hot and penetrating). On account of the Gunas by which it acts on Gadha Dosha and also by its Kushthaghna Prabhava (specific capacity against the skin diseases) it might have provided better relief for these symptoms. Both the groups showed nearly similar results in Krishna Aruna Varna because Vamana Karma eliminated the vitiated Pitta along with the Kapha, thereafter formation of Prashasta (proper) Rasa Dhatus took place, which might have reduced Krishna Aruna Varna. Both the groups showed no relief in Asvedanam and Mahavastu, because these features were indicative of a longstanding nature, severe pathology, and deeply involved the Dhatus. Only Vamana Karma or any other Shodhana (cleansing) might not be capable of relieving it, without the administration of Shamana drugs, for longer duration.

Effect of therapy after complete Treatment (Vamana followed by Shamana) on chief symptoms
After complete treatment, both the groups showed almost similar effect on Asvedanam, Mahavastu, Matsyashakalopam, Krishna Aruna Varna, Kandu, and Rukshata. Ekakushtha is Kapha Vata Pradhana Kushtha and its line of treatment is ‘Vamanam Shlaeshmottareshu Kushtheshu’[9] (emesis is best for Kapha-dominant skin diseases). Therefore, first Vamana Karma should be done to elinimate the vitiated Kapha Dosha along with Pitta. For the Vata Dosha, Sneha is indicated as ‘Vatottareshu Sharpi’ (Ghee is best for Vata-dominant skin diseases) and after Vamana, Snehapana is also indicated in Kushtha as ‘Snehasya Panam Ishtam Shuddhe Koshthe’ (internal oleation after cleansing).[10] In this study after Vamana Karma, Panchatikta Ghrita was given as Shamana Sneha, which settled the Vata, residual Pitta, and also purified the Rasa and Rakta, by its Tikta Rasa (bitter taste) and Kushthaghna property. Thus, after complete treatment, both the groups showed nearly similar results.

Conclusion
Ekakushtha is quite similar to psoriasis due to its maximum similarity in chief signs and symptoms.

Beeja is a useful part of Krutavedhana and in powder form; its dose is 5 to 7 g for Vamana Karma.

Krutavedhana has produced a good number of Vega, Pittanta Lakshana, and Pravara Shuddhi in a majority of patients.

Madanaphala is the best among all Vamaka drugs, but Krutavedhana shows a similar to higher effect on Vamana Karma, in terms of Antiki, Maniki, Vaigiki, and Laingiki Shuddhi.

Vamana Karma by Krutavedhana showed better relief in Matsyashakalopam, Kandu, and Rukshata, while Madanphala showed better relief in Krishn Aruna Varna.

After completion of treatment, both the groups showed almost similar effect on Asvedanam, Matsyashakalopam, Kandu, Rukshata, Krishnaruna Varna, and Mahavastu.

Krutavedhana may be taken as one of the best Vamaka Dravya for Vamana Karma in Ekakushtha.
