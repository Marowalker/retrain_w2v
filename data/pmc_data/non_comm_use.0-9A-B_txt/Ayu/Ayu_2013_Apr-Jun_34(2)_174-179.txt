This condition resembles with Yauvanapidika described in Ayurveda under the caption of Kshudraroga. In this study, 50 patients with symptoms of Yauvanapidika were treated in two groups. In Group A, patients were given local application of Shalmalyadilepa twice a day with milk, while in Group B patients were given 2 gm of Guduchyadivati thrice along with local application of Shalmalyadilepa. At the end of treatment, Group B showed better improvement in comparison to Group A.

==== Body
Introduction
Face is considered as an important part of the body as far as beauty and look is concerned. Hence, everyone in general and youngsters in particular are very cautious about beauty of their face. Yauvanapidika (acne) is such a condition that disfigures the face during adolescent to younger age. If the condition remains untreated, it leaves permanent scars over the face.

The disease Yauvanapidika occurs due to vitiation of Kapha, Vata, and Rakta.[1] Swabhava (natural status) has also been considered as one of the causative factors.[2] Though the Tarunyaavastha (adolescent period) is the age for Shukra pradurbhava (manifestation of Shukra Dhatu) and Sharangadhara has mentioned Vaktre Snigdhata (unctuousness on face) and Pidika (boil) formation on face as Mala (waste product) of Shukra Dhatu.[3] So, development of the acne in this age is obvious. Charaka has described second half of Balyaavastha as Vivardhamanaavastha (growing period) for all Dhatus and Anavasthita Chittatva (unstable mind).[4] This indicates a specific phase of life cycle, where Dhatu maturation is going on and for the same, secretion of various growth hormones definitely took place. Imbalanced hormonal levels play a key role in development of various diseases.

According to modern medical science, acne is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilo sebaceous units, characterized by the formation of comedones, erythematic papules and pustules, less frequently nodules or cysts too.[5] It occurs due to colonization of microbial flora (p. acne) and imbalance status of androgen like hormones. Excessive sweating, constipation, and stress are also considered as the aggravating factors.

To treat, modern medical science suggests hormonal therapy, antibiotics, and some surgical or para-surgical measures. As these measures have certain limitations, alternatives are being searched for significant relief. Herbal formulations that purify blood, check the status of Kapha and Pitta can be used safely in the condition for longer duration.

Taking into consideration of the above facts, present study was planned to evaluate the effect of Shalmalyadilepa and Guduchyadivati in Yauvanapidika as Shamana therapy.

Materials and Methods
Selection of patients
Total 50 patients with symptoms of Yauvanapidika, fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected from O.P.D. of IPGT and RA Hospital, Jamnagar, and grouped into two groups. Ethical clearance was obtained from Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) prior to starting the study.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients of 15 to 30 years of age with signs and symptoms of Yauvanapidika were included in the study. Yauvanapidika due to other systemic diseases like Prameha, Masurika etc., were excluded.

Diagnostic criteria
Patients having cardinal symptoms of the disease like Pidika on face, and/or chest-upper back including Medogarbhatva, Ruja, Daha, Paka, Srava, etc.

Investigations
Routine hematological and urine routine and microscopic investigations were carried out before starting the treatment to exclude other systemic pathologies, if any.

Drugs and Posology
Poly-herbal formulations, Shalmalyadilepa for external application and Guduchyadivati for oral administration were selected in the present study.

The Lepa was prepared from the herbs as mentioned in Chakradatta Kshudrarogadhikara and said to be useful in Yauvanapidika. The formulation composition includes Shalmali (Salmalia malabarica DC.) thorn, Vata (Ficus bengalensis Linn.) buds, Jaatiphala (Myristica fragrans Houtt.) fruits, Lodhra (Symplocos racemosa Roxb.) bark, Masoora (Lens culinaris Medic) seed, and Raktachandana (Pterocarpus santalinus Linn.) stem.

As vitiation of Pitta, Kapha and Rakta is considered in the development of acne, a formulation that can purify blood and check aggravated Kapha and Pitta will be beneficial. Taking in to consideration, Guduchyadivati containing powders of Guduchi (Tinospora cordifolia Willd.) stem, Manjistha (Rubia cordifolia Linn.) root, and Krishnasariva (Hemidesmus indicus) root in equal proportion was chosen for the present study.

Group A patients were advised to apply Shalmalyadilepa twice a day with milk over affected area of the face. It was advised to remove the lepa immediately after getting dried.

Group B patients were administered four tablets (500 mg each) of Guduchyadivati thrice a day with water along with local application of Shalmalyadilepa. Duration of the study was one month in both the groups. Follow-up was done for one month.

Pathya apathya
All the patients of the study were explained Pathya and Apathya (do's and don’ts) of the disease and advised to follow it.

Criteria for assessment
The result was assessed on the basis of specially prepared proforma and scoring pattern designed for each symptom.

Scoring pattern

Probable mode of action
Shalmalyadilepa
Ingredients of Shalmalyadilepa are Laghu Guna brings about Lekhana and Vrana Ropana.[6] Ruksha Guna has property of Kharata and Stambhana.[7] Kharata is expected to relieve symptoms of Medogarbhatva. Madhura Rasa is Kshina kshata sandhana kara.[8] Hence, it improves wound healing, and in this way it reduces Vranavastu (scar). Kapha-Pitta Shamaka property of Shalmalyadilepa, relieves Daha and Kapha dominating symptoms like Kandu, Medogarbhatva, Shotha, etc.

Gudoochyadivati
Guduchayadivati possess Madhura, Tikta, Kashaya Rasa with dominancy of Guru, Snigdha Guna, and combination of Ushna and Sheeta Virya drugs exhibiting Tridosha shamaka property thereby exerts curative action on Daha and Vrana. Tikta Rasa has property of Deepana and Pachana, which potentiates Jatharagni and Dhatvagni, and in this way it reduces the formation of Ama resulting in arresting of progression in Dhatu shaithilya. Madhura Rasa by its Prasadana and Varnakara property improves fairness of the skin. Due to predominance of Ushna Virya in the composition of Guduchyadivati brings about pacification of Vata Dosha and relieves symptoms like Vedana and also improves Dhatvagni. Guduchi and Sariva having properties of Tridoshahara while Manjishtha is Vata kapha shamaka. Hence, collectively all these drugs may act on Pitta and may have shown improvement in Raktavaha Sroto Dushti Lakshana.

Conclusion
Yauvanapidika, generally appears between 15 to 20 years, the age of adolescent to younger hood, but it may appear even at the age of 30 years too. Male individuals, who are dominant with Kapha Pitta Prakriti are more prone to this condition. Kapha, Pitta, Rasa, and Rakta are the involved dosha and dushya in this condition. Hence, local along with internal medications is required to check the pathogenesis. In the current study, Shalmalyadilepa along with Guduchyadivati (Group B) has shown better effect than only external application of Shalmalyadilepa. As the condition is Yapya, in order to obtain good results, the duration of the therapy may be increased.
