Introduction
Ayurved is one of the greatest gifts given by the sages of ancient India to mankind. Ayurved is designed for healthy and long life. Agni (digestive fire), Prakruti (constitution), Dhatusarata (tissue excellence), Doshas (bio energies) are the pillars of Ayurveda, which help in diagnosis, treatment and research.

Human physiology depends on balanced state of Dosha, Dhatu (tissues) and Mala (waste materials). Among these, Dhatus can be called as stabilizing pillars of the body. Well-nourished Dhatus give strength to maintain health and immunity. The strength of body and mind can be evaluated by Dhatusarata, which has been specified in Charak Samhita Viman Sthan 8th chapter while explaining Dashavidha Pariksha (tenfold examination). Dhatusarata is qualitative, quantitative and functional assessment of Dhatus. By knowing true strength of Dhatu, an individual can choose a particular profession and achieve success.

It is difficult to assess each and every quality of Dhatusarata mentioned in Charak Samhita for, e.g. Sukha, Aishwarya, Upabhaog, Bala etc., Among these, Sukha quality is quoted in Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Meda and Shukra Sara. Sukha is the feeling in which a person is comfortable with. Whether this feeling of liking is same in Dhatusaras or it has a different meaning according to qualities of Dhatus should be ruled out to get successes with ease. As there is a lot of saturation in money making careers and such saturation leads to competition, individuals’ have to compromise with their liking and interest. That means only ability is not enough to get success; the liking or interest is also essential to achieve success.

The present study has been taken up to understand the concept of Sukha and its shades as per different Dhatusaras. With the help of Dhatusarata and different shades of Sukha, an individual can be guided in choosing appropriate profession, according to his ability and liking to become successful in that particular profession.

This conceptual study will be helpful in various vocational guidance centers for advising career to job seekers according to their liking and ability. It will also help in assigning a particular designation to an employee based on his ability in multinational companies. One can advise a particular job profile according to one's Dhatusarata.

Materials and Methods
Only textual materials are consulted for present study and from which the relevant references have been collected. The principal Ayurvedic texts referred in this study are Charak Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, Kashyap Samhita and the available commentaries on them.

Characteristic features of Dhatusarata, i.e. tissue excellence in terms of qualities and functions are evaluated for this study and the outcome is applied in vocational guidance.

Review of Literature
Sukha is happiness and this quality is available in various Dhatusaras. Sarata is described by Chakrapani as Vishuddatara Dhatu (highest level of tissue excellence).[1] The different meanings of Sara are strength, strong, highest, excellent, essence.[2] Charakacharya[3] and Sushrutacharya[4] described Dhatusaras. Both Samhitakaras have described eight types of Sara namely Tvak Sara or Rasa Sara, Rakta Sara, Mamsa Sara, Meda Sara, Asthi Sara, Majja Sara, Shukra Sara and Satva Sara. Description of Sara is also given in Kashyap Samhita.[5] Acharyas of Ayurved have clearly mentioned that Uttarottara Dhatusarata is Shreshtha, i.e. Rakta Sara is superior to Tvak Sara, Mamsa Sarata is superior to Rakta Sarata and so on.

While reviewing Ayurvedic literature, it is found that Sukha quality is not merely happiness. Acharya Dalhana opined this quality as Anukul Vedana (comfort zone) of the individual.[6] Sukha is liking or the thing in which the person is comfortable with. It means Sukha quality related to different Dhatusaras is having different shades. By knowing these shades of a particular Dhatu of that person, one can get an appropriate idea about his likings or the things he is comfortable with. By evaluation of Dhatusarata, one can know the true strength or ability of an individual. Thus by assessing Dhatusarata and Sukha, one can guide the person in choosing appropriate profession which will be according to individual's liking and also he will have the ability to become successful in that particular profession.

Concept of Vocational Guidance
A vocation is a career or calling and this is derived from the Latin vocare, which means “to call”. Vocational guidance means helping someone finding at least a suitable career choice. Vocations or careers can be randomly categorized into areas such as service, technical, mechanical, creative, health and business etc.[7]

Vocational exploration courses offer students an opportunity to search different career possibilities as well as learn which vocational areas they have potency or talent in. For instance, many vocational guidance classes give tests to the students which test their ability with numbers, words, mechanical concepts and many more subjects. Tests designed to measure an individual's personality traits, intelligence quotient (IQ) as well as his or her main values and interests are administered and analyzed by career counselors.

Vocational guidance is useful for all students who want to choose their career categories (around 11th class) as well as for all individuals who want to tailor the career according to their personal interests. It is observed that some people change several careers in their life, while others stay in the same field during all their working years. All this depends on feeling of comfort, i.e. Sukha in their jobs.

Interrelation between Dhatusarata and Vocational Guidance
Vocational guidance offers students the opportunity to search for different career possibilities as well as to learn which vocational areas they have aptitude or talent. By identifying one's own Dhatusarata, it is possible to guide the students in selecting their career that will suit to their liking as well as their ability for better future. If we recognize this and follow the guidelines according to Dhatusarata, we will not end up with the physical and mental health hassles that can lead to major complications.

Discussion
Description of Dhatusarata available in Ayurvedic texts is subjective. Objective data is more acceptable rather than descriptive one for statistical analysis.

By knowing Dhatusarata, one can know about the abilities for particular profession but to get intimate success, one must concentrate on the comfort zone, i.e. Sukha. From literary study of Dhatusarata and Sukha, a questionnaire can be developed to assess Sukha in different Dhatusarata more precisely. Rasa/Twak Sara persons are rich in skin texture, i.e. their skin is radiant and fair, they have supple and nourished hair so we can say that these persons have Sukha of skin and hair texture. They can choose their career in modeling.

Rasa/Twak Sara persons are also very good tasters, they have a great sense of taste. So they can be good hoteliers. They can go on entire day on water or juice alone without feeling any physical distress because they naturally store plenty of energy in anticipation of such periods of deprivation. So it can be stated that these persons are expert in taste perception that means they like various tastes and they are very much comfortable with that.

Rakta Sara persons have Sukha in reading, writing, discussing, i.e. they have intellectual liking. Sukha in this context means a cause of satisfaction, so if this quality is utilized in their profession then they will be definitely successful and also enjoy their profession.

Mamsa Sara persons have a god gift of good physique. So it can be affirmed that they have Sukha in a state of physical wellbeing. They can utilize this quality accordingly by choosing their career as military officer or navy officer, sports like body building, wrestling, weight lifting etc.

Meda Sara persons have Sukha, i.e. they are comfortable with luxurious life. Here Sukha means a feeling that makes life pleasant. They cannot tolerate exertion so they require sedentary jobs. They are intelligent and suitable for administrative jobs. These people have boon of melodious voice, so they can be singers, announcers, commentators etc.

Shukra Sara persons have Sukha in art and beauty. Sukha in this context means liking, so if their career is related to some art or cosmetics etc., then they will be definitely successful and satisfied also.

Sukha quality is not mentioned in Asthi and Majjasara people. But Asthisara people are indulged in work and they love work, so we can say that they get Sukha or these people are comfortable with continuous work.

In case of Majjasara people, they are intellectually so strong that they are above the Sukha or comfort level. These people always think for others so they don’t think about self-comfort.

Overall, it is found that Sukha quality has different shades in all Dhatusaras such as liking, comfort, a cause of satisfaction, a state of physical wellbeing, a feeling that makes life pleasant etc.

By knowing the Sukha or comfort zone of a particular Dhatu of individual, it will help to get an appropriate idea about his abilities/likings or the things he is comfortable with. Also by knowing Uttam Dhatusarata of an individual, it will be easier to know about the true strength. So by the combination of these two, it is very easy to guide the person in choosing appropriate profession which will be according to individual's liking and also becomes successful in that particular profession.

An objective criterion in the form of questionnaire can be developed by this literary review. A retrospective study can be undertaken with the help of this manuscript and questionnaire to see whether successful people of same profession are having similarity in their Dhatusarata or not.

Conclusion
It has been concluded that shades of Sukha qualities varies with particular Dhatusaras. This study will be helpful to guide the person in choosing appropriate profession which will be according to his liking, i.e. Sukha and also he will have the ability to succeed in that particular profession. A particular designation can be assigned to an employee according to his ability and liking by knowing this concept of Dhatusarata and Sukha.
