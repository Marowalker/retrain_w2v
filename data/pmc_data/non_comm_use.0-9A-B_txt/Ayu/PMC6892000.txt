Type 2 diabetes is a lifestyle-related disorder that affects around 422 million individuals in India. Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) was conceived on pilot basis at Gaya, Bihar, to provide integrative treatment for non-communicable disease patients and to manage the burden of non-communicable diseases in India.

Objectives:
The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of Ayurveda intervention, lifestyle modification and Yoga in the management of type 2 diabetes under NPCDCS-AYUSH integration project.

Materials and Methods:
A multi-centric, open-labeled, prospective, comparative clinical study was conducted at 17 community health centers and 1 district hospital. Population over 30 years of age was screened and prediabetic or type 2 diabetic individuals were enrolled in two cohorts, i.e., pre-diabetic (Cohort A) and type 2 diabetic (Cohort B). Each cohort was further divided into two groups: Group A1 was advised for lifestyle modification and Yoga and group A2 was given Ayurveda medication in addition to lifestyle modification and Yoga. Similarly, group B1 was advised for lifestyle modification and Yoga along with allopathic medication and group B2 was given Ayurveda medication, i.e., Mamajjaka, Amalaki and Guduchi powder in addition to lifestyle modification and Yoga along with allopathic medication. Treatment was given for 6 months. Data were analyzed through paired t-test.

Results:
A significant reduction was observed in fasting blood sugar level in groups A2 and B2 (P = 0.001) and also in the postprandial blood sugar level in Groups A2 and B2 (P = 0.001). Further, improvement in subjective symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, blurred vision and weakness was found in all the groups, while non-healing ulcer does not show any improvement.

Conclusion:
The study reveals that Ayurveda intervention, i.e., Mamajjaka
Churna (1 g), Amalaki
Churna (3 g) and Guduchi
Churna (3 g) two times a day effectively controls blood sugar level in pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients and improves the disease management with lifestyle modification and Yogasana as well as with allopathic treatment.

Introduction
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) kill 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally.[1] According to the ICMR India State-Level Disease Burden Study report “India: Health of the Nation’s States,” the estimated proportion of all deaths due to NCDs has increased from 37.09% in 1990 to 61.8% in 2016.[2] The number of people with diabetes has risen from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults over 18 years of age has risen from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.55% in 2014. Almost half of all deaths were attributable to high blood glucose and occurred before the age of 70 years.[3] Physical inactivity, faulty diet, sedentary lifestyle habits and stress are the major risk factors of noninsulin-dependent diabetes. The main aim of the management of diabetes is to lower the blood glucose level either by intervention of medicine or by improving behavior of diet and lifestyle.

Ayurveda emphasized on the management of Prameha through diet and lifestyle modification (which can be correlated to diabetes).[4] Studies have also shown the effectiveness of Ayurveda intervention in the management of type 2 diabetes.[5]

Global report on diabetes (2016) by the WHO[6] and the National Health Policy (2017)[7] emphasized on the integrated management of NCDs. Keeping in view the strength of AYUSH systems for the prevention and management of NCDs by promoting healthy lifestyle, a project aimed for “Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS)” was conceived in 2015 by the Ministry of AYUSH and Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) in collaboration with Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), for imparting health services on pilot basis in the three districts of three states, namely Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Gaya (Bihar) and Surendranagar (Gujarat).[8] The present article reports interim analysis of the patient outcome through integrated management of diabetes (from April 2016 to December 2017) at 17 community health centers (CHCs) and 1 district hospital (DH) of Gaya district.

Objectives
The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of Ayurveda intervention, lifestyle modification and Yoga in the management of type 2 diabetes under NPCDCS-AYUSH integration project.

Materials and Methods
A multicenter, open-labeled study was conducted at 17 CHCs and 1 DH in Gaya district of Bihar. A total number of 1,04,627 individuals were screened for type 2 diabetes at 17 CHCs and 1 DH between April 2016 and December 2017 and out of them, a total of 7735 participants were enrolled as prediabetic and type 2 diabetic patients for integrated management between April 2016 and December 2017. The data of all those patients who completed the management of 6 months, i.e. 3044 patients were included in the analysis. Dropped out cases were 2049 and the rest of 2642 patients were at different phases of management as it is a ongoing project.

Enrolled patients were distributed in two cohorts: pre-diabetic, i.e., Cohort A and type 2 diabetic, i.e. Cohort B. Each cohort was further divided into two groups, i.e. A1 and A2 and B1 and B2 as follows:


Group A1 was advised for lifestyle modification and Yoga

Group A2 was given Ayurveda medication, lifestyle modification and Yoga

Group B1 was advised for lifestyle modification and Yoga along with allopathic medication

Group B2 was given Ayurveda medication, lifestyle modification and Yoga along with allopathic medication.




Ethical clearance
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee (15-1/IMR/RARIID/Patna/17-18/835 dated on June 10, 2017) and written informed consent was also taken before enrollment for intervention.

The case record forms (CRFs) and electronic format (E-format) were designed for recording the data of registered patients. The schematic diagram of the project is depicted in Figure 1.

Discussion
The trial drugs, i.e., Mamajjaka, Amalaki and Guduchi were found effective in controlling FBS and PPBS levels in type 2 diabetic individuals. Mamajjaka is a folklore drug which has been practiced since long time for the management of Prameha in India. Various studies have documented the potential role of Mamajjaka in controlling blood sugar levels.[11] It possesses Bitter Taste (Tikta Rasa)[12] which is known to help in stimulating metabolism.

Amalaki and Guduchi are documented in the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India to possess anti-diabetic activity.[1314] Further, Amalaki and Guduchi impart rejuvenating (Rasayana) effect that causes improvement in digestive functions and metabolism, thus enhancing glucose uptake by the cells. Amalaki is a rich source of Vitamin C and amino acids[15] and possesses immune-modulatory effect[16] and antioxidant activity.[17] Studies reported that Guduchi enhances glucose tolerance and lowers the blood glucose level.[18] It possesses antioxidant activity.[19]

Lifestyle modification contributes to the effect of Ayurveda medications as proper diet, abstinence of substance abuses such as tobacco and alcohol and management of daily routines will remove the causative factors of disease and help in preventing progression of disease.

Yoga has been practiced since ancient times to manage the physiology of the body. This not only improves the flexibility but also improves the function of both endocrines and exocrine glands of the body. Various studies have reported that Yoga has a positive impact in the management of type 2 diabetes. Different Asanas such as Surya Namaskara and Tadasana help in insulin production and improve digestive fire. Cleansing process in Yoga
Kriya like Kapalnbhati and Agnisara stimulates pancreatic cells and improves their efficiency.[20]

Subjective symptoms of type 2 diabetes, i.e. polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, blurred vision, and weakness showed improvement in all the groups. This was possibly due to elimination of causative factors through lifestyle modification and improvement in physiology through Yogic practices. Further, pharmacological intervention controls the blood sugar levels and thus, relief in subjective symptoms was observed. Few patients felt improvement in vision which may be due to retinopathy changes which are nonreversible. Fewer people perceived an improvement in non-healing ulcer. This is possibly because of requirement of localized treatment of the ulcer tissue.

On comparing the P values of the four groups in FBS, it was observed that though lifestyle and Yoga have a positive impact over the disease management, the groups having medical intervention in the form of Ayurveda or allopathic medicine, i.e. groups A2, B1 and B2 performed better than group A1. This implies that lifestyle and Yoga can prevent disease progression through removal of causative and aggravating factors, but pharmacological intervention is required to manage the disease. Yoga regulates eating pattern and leads to medication adherence.[20] Diet plays an important role in the management of every disease as medicine is effective only in the presence of proper diet.[21]

Similarly, groups having Ayurveda medication, i.e., groups A2 and B2 showed better treatment outcome than group B1 which is having allopathic medicine along with lifestyle and Yoga in diseased cases. This signifies that type 2 diabetic patients responded better to Ayurveda medications, i.e., Mamajjaka, Amalaki and Guduchi in the current study. The reasons for better response may be multi-modal action of Ayurveda medications which not only relieve the symptoms but also stimulate the glands, rejuvenate the cells, and improve the uptake of glucose in the body and may probably increase insulin sensitivity. Similar observations were also observed during analysis of PPBS levels.

This highlights the importance of management of type 2 diabetes through integrative approach with Ayurveda medications that help to correct the vitiated Dosha and help in improving metabolism as reflected through the laboratory parameters and subjective parameters. Thus, Ayurveda intervention exhibits potential for integrative management along with lifestyle modifications, Yoga and allopathic anti-diabetic agents.

The acceptance of Ayurveda intervention was overwhelming among population as depicted by large proportion of participants in groups A2 and B2, where Ayurveda medication was prescribed. Further, a number of participants in the groups without Ayurveda medications were very less. The reason may be the inclination of individuals for pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Limitations of the study
The laboratory investigations such as serum insulin HbA1C, fasting and PPBS are the key factors in diagnosis and analysis of the result of the study, but there was restricted availability of in-house and outsourced laboratory facilities at every CHCs well in time.

Conclusion
The study reveals that Ayurveda intervention, i.e. Mamajjaka
Churna (1 g), Amalaki
Churna (3 g) and Guduchi
Churna (3 g) two times/day effectively controls blood sugar level in pre-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients and improves the disease management with lifestyle modification and Yogasana as well as with allopathic treatment.

Way forward

Further studies should be carried out for the assessment of quality of life during integrative management

The present study shows an increased flow of participants in groups having medical intervention. This implies a psychological aspect of taking some medication along with lifestyle modification and Yoga for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Hence, to get comparable number of participants in each group, further studies may be planned with a placebo in those groups where only lifestyle modification and Yoga had been prescribed.
