We welcome all our readers, reviewers, and subscribers in the second year of the online publication of AYU. Recently, Index Copernicus, Poland, has evaluated journals and given AYU an IC value of 5.64 for year 2010, which is a good one for a new online journal. Index Copernicus has critically analyzed the quality of the journal in each perspective and given good points to AYU in view of scientific quality, editorial quality, circulation and availability, technical quality, and production values. The scientific quality evaluation score was appraised on the basis of original papers, international papers, and total number of papers published in a year. We extend invitation to more international scholars to publish their researches in the field of Ayurveda in AYU. We assure to improve the technical lacunae noticed in further issues during year 2011.

AYU provides a good platform to the researchers of different levels. The mission of AYU is clearly to encourage ayurvedic baseline researchers and scholars to publish their work in a scientific way. The writing and reviewing process itself creates awareness and upgrades the article as well as improves the vision of the author(s) to explore the new angle of research which might have been missing. This process is indeed a great contribution to make Ayurveda updated. Therefore, we encourage the newer budding researchers to come forward and develop their scientific writing skills. We have also published the original researches of leading international ayurvedic scientists from modern faculties. Thus each issue of AYU is a unique standard combination of articles from newcomers and experienced scientists. The indexing of AYU to PubMed is in process and the task will be completed soon. Ayurvedic authors need to be encouraged to cite references properly, because after much efforts by the editorial staff and many requests, authors are not quoting the references properly, which unnecessarily delays the publication process. Ayurvedic authors may refer and quote the earlier published studies on the topic in the particular journal as all the issues are now available freely on web. This will craft a positive approach of looking toward the published articles and improve the impact factor of the journal.

The Department of AYUSH under the able guidance of the new Secretary and his team is making many splendid optimistic efforts to develop Ayurveda on the global platform. All the Ayurvedic institutions in India should support and share the initiatives for the benefit of Ayurveda. The publication of scientific articles, by the researchers, in a journal is a significant contribution as it has a great impact on the society. The Department of AYUSH is the financial lifeline of almost all the Ayurvedic journals in India, which is an admirable job done by the organization. The another welcome step by the Department of AYUSH in collaboration with Rashtriya Ayurveda Vidyapeeth (RAV) is to conduct various reorientation training programs (RoTPs), such as Continuing Medical Education (CME), etc., for training of Ayurvedists. One such unique program under this scheme, i.e., Ayurvedic orientation program for allopathic doctors, was recently organized for the first time at Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India. The response was good and more allopathic doctors had taken interest to learn the basic concepts of Ayurveda. Such events are undoubtedly beneficial to broaden the scope of Ayurveda in the society and will work as a bridge to bring together both the systems of medicine.

The present issue of AYU is again a treat for all. The first article by Dr. Gopal Basisht (Rheumatologist, USA) is going to be a landmark in changing the views of Ayurvedists and allopathic doctors as well. It gives a new thinking approach named “symbio-health,” which is truly beneficial for the society globally. The second article on understanding personality is authored by Mrs. Shilpa Daatar who is a psychologist and keenly interested in the persuasion of concepts of Ayurvedic Psychology. The article revisits the ancient Ayurvedic wisdom in a psychological perspective. Including this article, there are 19 original articles and 2 review articles in the issue. The issue covers various topics like personality, and clinical researches on burning problems like diabetes, hypertension, vitiligo, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, etc. An article on age-old Tailabindu urine examination, which is a unique diagnostic test of Ayurveda, is also included. On drug research, there are five articles enveloping various aspects like Sneha Kalpana and drug delivery, pharmaceutical standardization of most popular preparation Makaradhwaja, and pharmacognostical and pharmacological study. At last, a review on aging and a review on Aushdhiya Krishi Vijnana in Hindi, to keep the “Hindi, the pride of India flavor on,” is included. We hope that this issue will be more of thought-provoking and educational value to the Ayurveda.
