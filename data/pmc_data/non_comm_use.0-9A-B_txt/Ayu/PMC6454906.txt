Kshara is derived from the word “Ksharana” that means as something that mobilizes and removes the deformed flesh, skin, tissue, etc., due to its corrosive nature (Ksharanata). Pratisarniya Kshara has been further classified into three types on the basis of its potency – Mridu (mild), Madhyama (moderate) and Tikshna (strong). This study aims at comparison between (Mridu and Tikshna) Apamarga Kshara on the basis of pharmacognostical and pharmaceutical evaluation.

Materials and Methods:
Apamarga Panchanga (whole plant of Achyranthes aspera Linn.) was collected, and authentication was done by the expert. Mridu Apamarga Kshara (MAK) and Tikshna Apamarga Kshara (TAK) were prepared as proposed by Sushruta Samhita. Pharmacognostical and pharmaceutical analyses were carried out according to standard protocol.

Observation and Results:
Both the Kshara showed their own peculiar crystal system and analytical findings showed higher pH value (10.65) and calcium content (6.1%) in TAK as compared to MAK.

Discussion:
Quantitative micrometric microscopy showed more amount of crystals in TAK (13/mm2) than MAK (6/mm2), which may be due to Kapardika and Chitrakamoola (roots of Plumbago zeylenica Linn.). pH of MAK and TAK was 10.2 and 10.65, respectively. This result showed that TAK is more alkaline, which may be also due to Kapardika and Chitrakamoola.

Conclusion:
Sodium and potassium ion concentration was higher in MAK (Na+ = 26%, K+ = 45%) as compared to TAK (Na+ = 12.6%, K+ = 32.5%). Calcium ion estimation was lower (2.31%) in MAK and higher (6.1%) in TAK. These findings can be further used for the standardization purpose of Tikshna Kshara which may enrich the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India.

Introduction
“Kshara” has scope in Shalya Tantra (surgical and para-surgical) to its Chedana (incising), Lekhana (scraping) and Ropana (healing) qualities.[1] Sushruta has dedicated a whole chapter to Kshara and narrated Kshara as an Anushastra (secondary instrument), Upayantra (secondary appliance), and one of the Upakrama of Vrana (interventions for wound care).[234] Dalhana; the renowned commentator of Sushruta Samhita defined “Ksharana” as something that mobilizes and removes the deformed flesh, skin, tissue etc. It removes the debris from their location due to its corrosive nature (Ksharanata). Kshara possesses dominance of Katu Rasa (pungent taste) and Lavana (salt) as Anurasa (secondary taste).[5] On the basis of application, Sushruta has mentioned two types of Kshara, i.e., Pratisarniya (external application) and Paniya (internal application).[6] Pratisarniya Kshara has been further classified into three types on the basis of its potency – Mridu (mild), Madhyama (moderate) and Tikshna (strong).[7] Kshara are penetrating in nature, hot in potency, antihelminthic, vitiate Pitta and Rakta and help in the digestion of substances help in the breakdown of hard masses and perforating the tissues. Being pungent in smell and salty in taste, it has ill effect on heart, semen, Oja, hair and eyes.[8] Sushruta has mentioned three types of Pratisaraniya Kshara as per potency, but indications of these three different types are not mentioned. However, Tikshna Kshara is used for treating piles, fistula-in-ano, rectal prolapse, pilonidal sinus, infected wound, and some types of skin disease, whereas Mridu Kshara is used in the preparation of Ksharasutra, for local application in hypergranulated or fresh wounds and for internal use in diseases such as renal calculi, asthma and diseases of alimentary canal.[91011] Mridu and Tikshna Kshara are traditionally used in different conditions, and their effect on body tissue varies as observed clinically. This study aims to compare between the types of Apamarga Kshara (Mridu and Tikshna) on the basis of their pharmacognostical and pharmaceutical evaluation.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of Mridu Apamarga Kshara and Tikshna Apamarga Kshara
Apamarga Panchanga (whole plant of Achyranthes aspera Linn.) and Chitrakamoola (root of Plumbago zeylenica Linn.) were procured from the pharmacy of Gujarat Ayurved University. Authentication of both the samples was done on the basis of macro- and micro-morphological characteristics at Pharmacognosy laboratory, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar, Gujarat [Figure 1]. The dried Apamarga Panchanga was burnt along with crude lime stone, and the ash was collected. The ash was weighed and transferred to a clean vessel [Figure 2] and dissolved in water in 1:6 proportion; the mixture was mixed well and then allowed to settle down for 24 h. After 24 h, the solution was filtered 21 times, and a soapy, viscous, red-tinted liquid (Ksharajala) was obtained. This liquid was subjected to mild continuous heating with intermittent stirring [Figure 2].[12] For the preparation of MAK, Ksharajala was further boiled till water evaporated completely and a white powder (MAK) was obtained [Figure 2]. [13]

For the preparation of TAK, some quantity of Ksharajala was taken and red-hot Kapardika (1/10 part of ash) was quenched in it. This solution was filtered and mixed with rest of the Ksharajala, and then paste of root of Chitraka (1/100 part of ash) was added and heated with intermittent stirring, from which a reddish semi-solid substance (TAK) was obtained [Figure 2].[14]

Organoleptic evaluation
Organoleptic characteristics such as color, odor, taste and touch were noted down by sensory observations for both the Kshara (MAK and TAK).

Pharmacognostical evaluation
Pharmacognostical study was carried out in two phases. First, the microscopy of raw drugs and then the final products, i.e., MAK and TAK was done for standardization purpose at the Pharmacognosy laboratory, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar, as per the standard procedure. The drug was placed on a slide and distilled water was added to observe the specific characteristics of drugs. Microphotographs were taken with the help of Carl Zeiss trinocular microscope attached to the camera.[1516]

Pharmaceutical analysis
Physicochemical parameters
Preliminary physicochemical parameters such as loss on drying (LOD) at 110°C, ash value, acid-insoluble ash and pH value were analyzed as per the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API).[17]

Estimation of sodium and potassium ions
Estimation of sodium and potassium ions was done by flame photometer at the Analytical Laboratory, IPGT and RA, Jamnagar.[18]

Estimation of calcium and iron
Estimation of calcium and iron was carried out by standard protocol at the Analytical Laboratory of IPGT and RA, Jamnagar.[19]

Observations and Results
Organoleptic characteristics

Discussion
Pharmacognostical study for the authentication, i.e., microscopic study, showed some distinctive characteristics of the drug such as Apamarga Panchanga comprised of stellate, warty and simple trichomes, cluster, prismatic and rod-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate and Chitrakamoola powder comprised of simple fibers, tannin contents and rosette crystals.

Apamarga Kshara Jala was prepared as per classical text and further used for preparing MAK and TAK. The finished product was white powder for MAK and reddish, semi-solid for TAK. The pharmacognostical study reveals that TAK showed certain peculiar characteristics of ingredients, i.e., fibers and vessels of Chitrakamoola and many crystals of various shapes and sizes as compared to MAK. Quantitative microscopy showed more crystals in TAK (13/mm2) than MAK (6/mm2), which may be because of further processing of Kshara Jala with Kapardika and Chitrakamoola.

The pharmaceutical analysis showed lesser value of LOD in TAK as compared to MAK. As TAK is semisolid in consistency, it has more water content as compared to MAK. pH of 5% solution of both the samples at room temperature was 10.2 and 10.65 for MAK and TAK, respectively. This result showed that TAK is more alkaline, which may be because of its processing with Kapardika and Chitrakamoola. Sodium and potassium ion concentration was higher in MAK (Na+ = 26%, K+ = 45%) as compared to TAK (Na+ =12.6%, K+ =32.5%). Calcium ion estimation was lower (2.31%) in MAK and higher (6.1%) in TAK, which might be due to the addition of Kapardika (cowry, CaCO3) in TAK.

In this study, an attempt has been made to differentiate MAK and TAK on the basis of quantitative micrometry and analytical parameters such as LOD value, pH value, and Na+, K+, and Ca2+ concentration. Sushruta has described three different Kshara on the basis of the potency which may be because of their different actions on the body tissue, which can be justified by more alkalinity of TAK over MAK. Thus, TAK can be used at places where more debridement is expected such as in hemorrhoids, fistula-in-ano, and unhealthy wounds, whereas MAK can be used at places where less debridement is present as for internal administration in calculi, bronchial asthma, gastrointestinal tract disorders, etc. TAK can be used in wound care as it has more calcium ion concentration, as some research studies report that calcium ion promotes wound healing in an early stage.[20]

Conclusion
In this study, first attempt has been made to generate the analytical profile and to differentiate two types of Apamarga Kshara (Mridu and Tikshna) on the basis of pharmacognostical and pharmaceutical evaluation. The findings can be further used for the standardization purpose of Tikshna Kshara which may enrich the API. The limitation of this study is that the Kshara of Apamarga Panchanga may vary from place to place.
