Proceeding in that direction, a review of the Muladhara Chakra was carried out in the texts of tantric literature, modern literature, journals and online publications. After going through various literatures, it is found that hindrance in normal body physiology may occur due to deactivation of Shat Chakra. Anatomically, each Chakra represents various plexus and sub-plexuses which are concerned with certain organs and its supply. Hence, there is a need to find each and every anatomical structure related to Chakras. Acharya Gananath Sen in his commentary Pratyaksha Shariram concluded that all the pelvic organs closely resemble with Muladhara Chakra. A cadaveric dissection has been carried out to correlate and establish that the anatomical structures which closely resemble the Muladhara Chakra can be thought of as inferior hypogastric plexus and its sub plexuses.

Introduction
General description of Chakra
In literary text, Chakra means “Wheels of light.” These are the center of energy that are located throughout the body and provide a passage for energy to enter and exit our body and help to regulate all type of energy flow, i.e. physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Our body has seven major Chakra. These seven Chakra are situated along the spine and each has special function. These are psychic center of the astral body governing a group of functions. Anatomically, these Chakra may represent the nerve plexuses which is having different functions according to their area of supply. These plexuses are in the form of spokes around wheel.[1]

General description of Muladhara Chakra
The triangular part in between the anus and genitalia is called the Muladhara Chakra.[2] It is attached to the mouth of the Sushumna (spinal cord) and is placed below the genitals and above the anus. It has four petals of crimson hue. Its head (mouth) hangs downward. Its petals are the four letters, i.e. Vama, Sama, Shama and Shhama of the shining color of gold,[3] which is characteristics of each petal. The Chakra is situated at the base of spinal column. It forms nerve plexuses around the Sushumna (spinal cord). This region of Muladhara Chakra represents the pelvic organs, i.e. rectum, uterus, bladder and testis.[4] Hence, regarding location of Muladhara Chakra, it may be mid-perineum area.[5] It is the ground for Apana Vayu.[67] The function of Apana Vayu is being excretion of semen, urine and feces and also delivering fetus.[8] Similar functions are allotted to Muladhara Chakra in Shat Chakra Nirupana.[9] In modern texts, these functions are carried out as a reflex action by pelvic plexuses (inferior hypogastric plexus).[10] The aim of this work was to ascertain the possible location of Muladhara Chakra as being described in ancient texts by a meticulous review and cadaveric dissection. A thorough review of modern literature was done for its anatomically correlated structure (or nerve plexus) to support the indications in the Ancient texts and bring focused clarity about the structure of Muladhara Chakra.

Objectives
The study had the following objectives:


To locate the appropriate position of Muladhara Chakra in the body

To correlate the four petals of Muladhara Chakra with sub-plexuses of inferior hypogastric plexus.




Materials and Methodology
Materials

Available ancient and modern literatures

Six cadavers

Dissection kit.




Methods
Literature study
Considering the aim of structural anatomy of Muladhara Chakra, review of the ancient literature pertaining to Muladhara Chakra will be done and systematically arranged.

Cadaveric study
Dissection of six cadavers was done in dissection hall of department of Sharira Rachana, faculty of Ayurveda, IMS-BHU. First, markings were done on the cadaver regarding the position of Muladhara Chakra in the abdominal region and then in the pelvic region. These regions are dissected as per the guidelines given in ayurvedic texts by Acharya Sushruta,[11] the Cunningham’s manual of practical anatomy,[12] and Human anatomy by Dr. B. D. Chaurasia.[13] Superficial and deep dissection was done with careful approach to study the structures present at the marked site.

The information gathered from various literatures is correlated with the findings from dissection and conclusion is drawn.

Observations
Physiological resemblance (literary study)
The inferior hypogastric plexus constitutes the sacral division of parasympathetic system which directly controls the excretion of feces, urine, semen and fetus and the execution of sex act and reproduction. These are the reflex functions. These functions are executed through its four subdivisions which are uterine, vaginal, rectal and vesical. These same functions are confirmed as belonging to Muladhara Chakra.Deity of Muladhara Chakra is Dakini. On the basis of its characteristics defined in Upanishada it represent sensory impulses in our body traveled through neuronal plexuses which always carry the illumination of information. This proves that the deity Dakini represents sensory afferent centers of reflexes or actions. Thus, Dakini consists of those peripheral ganglionic cells which receive the sacral parasympathetic afferents from all four petals or sub-plexuses of Muladhara Chakra.[14]

Anatomical resemblance (cadaveric study)
On dissection, we found that the location of inferior hypogastric plexus is somewhat similar to the location of Muladhara Chakra [Figure 1].

The inferior hypogastric plexus was found nearly triangular in structure which shows similarity with the structure of Muladhara Chakra[15] [Figure 2].

This cadaveric study showed the four subplexuses of inferior hypogastric plexus innervating pelvic visceras (rectal plexus; spermatic plexus/uterine plexus; Vesical plexus; Prostatic plexus/Vaginal plexus) which may be correlated to the four Dalas (petals) of Muladhara Chakra [Figure 3]. The four Dalas or petals of Muladhara Chakra can be correlated with four subsidiary plexuses of inferior hypogastric plexus [Table 1].

Discussion
Hence, from the above observations, we can say that the Sushumna (spinal cord) is the axis of all the Chakras. Muladhara Chakra is anatomically represented by inferior hypogastric plexus. Both are triangular in structure. This finding is coherent with the study of Mauroy et al.[18] Inferior hypogastric plexus works as axle of this Muladhara Chakra (wheel). It is a definite neuro-endo-vascular entity in the vicinity of pelvis, which governs, regulates and mediates the all pelvic functions through small plexus to all pelvic organs. The four Dalas, i.e. Vama, Sama, Shama and Shhama represent the four sub-plexuses of inferior hypogastric plexus which are uterine, vaginal, middle rectal and vesicle plexus.

Conclusion
Earlier studies have already given the detailed description of Muladhara Chakra, but the above study reveals some scientific explanation to the position of Muladhara Chakra which is being either side of superior hypogastric plexus, i.e., inferior hypogastric plexus. The four petals of Muladhara Chakra correspond to four pelvic subplexuses, i.e., uterine plexus, vaginal (seminal plexus) plexus, vesicle plexus and middle rectal plexus. This study also reveals the triangular-shaped similarity of Muladhara Chakra with inferior hypogastric plexus. However, still more studies are required to throw light on other attributes related to Muladhara Chakra.
