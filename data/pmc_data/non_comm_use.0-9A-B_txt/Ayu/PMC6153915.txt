Due to sedentary lifestyle and stress, the incidence of metabolic disorders are increasing day by day. Among these polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is an intricate disorder affecting 4%–8% women in their reproductive age and related to ovarian dysfunction characterized by obesity, oligomenorrhea, anovulation and hyperandrogenism. In modern system of medicine, the available allopathic regimen has its own limitations, so it is need of time to find a safe and effective alternative therapy for such type of condition. The most common symptom in 85%–90% of PCOS patients is oligomenorrhea which can be correlated to Artava Kshaya (loss of menstrual fluid) in Ayurveda. Hence, in the present clinical study, Vamana Karma (therapeutic vomiting) with Ikshwaaku seed formulation followed by Shatapushpadi Ghanavati was planned.

Aims:
To evaluate the efficacy of Vamana Karma (therapeutic vomiting) followed by Shatapushpadi Ghanavati in the management of Aartava Kshaya (loss of menstrual fluid) w. s. r to PCOS.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 15 patients of PCOS were clinically diagnosed and treated by Vamana Karma (therapeutic vomiting) procedure with Ikshwaaku seed formulation. After completion of Vamana Karma (therapeutic vomiting) and Samsarjana Krama, (post therapy dietary regimen for revival) Shatapushpadi Ghanavati 2 Vati (each 500 mg) twice in a day with lukewarm water was given for 45 days. After completion of 2-month trial, assessment of therapy was estimated by subjective and objective parameters.

Results:
Statistically extremely significant (P < 0.0001) results were found in menstrual irregularities, obesity, and body mass index. The significant result in reduction of nondominant follicles (P = 0.01 and 0.03 for right and left ovary, respectively), lowering the fasting blood sugar level (P = 0.02) and hirsutism (P = 0.03) was found.

Conclusion:
Vamana Karma (therapeutic vomiting) followed by Shatapushpadi Ghanavati is very effective in the management of obese PCOS patients and increasing chances of conception.

==== Body
Introduction
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a most prevalent endocrinopathy which affects 4%–8% of women of reproductive age.[1] Forty percent of women have anovulatory infertility due to PCOS.[2] In this condition, hormonal imbalance affects follicular growth during the ovarian cycle causing the affected follicles to remain in immature form, leading to multiple ovarian cysts associated with obesity, oligomenorrhea, etc. Incidence of this disease is increasing nowadays because of sedentary lifestyle, pollution and excessive intake of junk food.[3]

In Ayurveda, such type of condition can be correlated under the broad heading of Artava Kshaya, as oligomenorrhea is the most common symptom affecting 85%–90% of PCOS patients.[4] The treatment advised for Artava Kshaya includes Samshodhana (bio purification) followed by Agneya drug and is the line of treatment according to Acharya Sushruta.[5] In further commentary on Sushruta Samhita, Dalhana describes Vamana Chikitsa (therapeutic emesis) for the same. For this purpose, Ikshwaaku seed formulation was specifically selected for Vamana Karma (therapeutic vomiting) as it is advised for Kapha and Granthi Vikara (cystic swellings).

Shatapushpadi Ghanavati [Table 1] contains Agni Mahabhuta (fire element) predominant drugs, which corrects the residual pathology in the context of PCOS.

Methodology
Procedure
Vamana Karma (therapeutic emesis)

Vamana Karma was administered in the following steps.

Panchakola powder[6] was used for Deepana and Pachana in the dosage of 3 g twice in a day before food for 3–7 days with lukewarm water followed by Snehapana (administration of oil orally) with Murchita Tila Taila[7] with initial 30 ml dose, increasing day by day according to Agni (digestive fire) and Koshtha (bowl motion habit) of the patient till Samyak Snigdha Lakshana (symptoms of complete oleation on body) were obtained. Dashamoola Taila was used for external therapeutic massage of oil to the entire body and Dashamoola Kwatha were used for external complete body massage with medicated oil for 2 days prior and on the day of Vamana.

Administration of Vamana Yoga-Ikshwaaku seed powder in the dosage of 5– 7 g with other conventional drugs such as Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.), Vacha (Acorus calamus Linn.), rock salt and honey.

Samsarjana Karma
The specific diet plan was advised to the patient according to Avara, Madhyama and Pravara Shuddhi (low, medium and complete purification level) after classical Vamana procedure.

Follow-up
Shatapushpadi Ghanavati (compounded formulation) was given for 45 days in the dose of 1 g (2 tablets each of 500 mg) for 2 times a day 1 or ½ h before food with lukewarm water.

Discussion
Effect of therapy on primary outcome measures
The primary outcome of therapy is regularization of menstrual cycle in relation to interval, duration and pain associated with it. ES results (P = 0.0010) were found in interval of menses, VS (P = 0.004) in duration of menses, and significant result (P = 0.015) in pain associated with menses. Artava Kshaya results due to vitiation of Rasa Dhatu (plasma and lymphatic tissues) and involvement of Kapha and Vata. Vamana is Srotoshodhaka (clearing micro-channels in the body) in nature. Shatapushpadi Ghanavati has Deepana (Stomachic), Pachana (Digestant), Agni Deepana (increases digestive procedures) and Artava Janana (regularize menstruation) properties. Hence, Vamana followed by Shatapushpadi Ghanavati removes the obstruction of flow of Vata and increases the Artava Dhatu (female reproductive tissues) qualitatively as well as quantitatively which help in menstrual irregularities.

The Vamana drug Ikshwaku has testosterone-lowering effect which may decrease the androgen level of body. Hence, after Vamana, significant relief in hirsutism (P = 0.03) was observed.

Effect of therapy on secondary outcome measures
Significant result (P = 0.01 for right ovary and P = 0.03 for left ovary) was found in decreasing number of NDFs. Vamana with Ikshwaaku has testosterone-lowering effect.[8] The decrease level of luteinizing hormone stimulates follicle-stimulating hormone level, which is helpful in maturation of follicles. Further Aam Pachana (detoxification of metabolic toxins), Agni Deepana (increases digestion) properties of Shatapushpadi Ghanavati help in reducing the NDFs directly.

Effect of therapy on associated factors
The significant result (P = 0.02) was obtained in decrease in FBS level after completion of therapy. Vamana Karma along with Shatapushpadi Ghanavati has Agni Deepana (increases digestion), Sroto Shodhaka (clearing micro-channels in the body) properties, which indirectly increase the metabolism of liver which is the prime site of glucose metabolism. In support to this, advanced researches show that Ikshwaku has lipid-lowering, hypoglycemic effect.[9]

ES (P < 0.0001) results were found in obesity and BMI after completion of therapy. Sthaulya (obesity) is the Rasapradoshaja Vikara (disease caused due to vitiation of plasma and lymphatic tissues). As Vamana Karma cleanses microchannels of body, further Shatapushpadi Ghanavati has Sroto Shodhaka (clearing micro-channels in the body), Agni Deepana (increases digestion) and Lekhana (scraping) properties which scrap excess Meda (fat) from body and help in reducing body weight in general and BMI specifically.

Probable mode of Vamana Karma
Vamana Karma is the best therapy for the elimination of Kapha Dosha. According to Ayurveda, PCOS may be considered as Agni Vaishamyajanya Vikara (disease caused due to vitiation of metabolism) in general and Rasagni (metabolism at Rasa Dhatu level) and Medodhatvagni (metabolism at Meda Dhatu level) Mandya deficient in particular with Bahu Dosha Avastha (vitiated Dosha). As far as Dosha is concerned based on the pathology and symptom complex, it is Kapha-Vataja disorder. Due to increased Kapha and Agnimandya (deficient metabolism), more number of follicles are produced but not matured, resulting in cyst formation causing obstruction to the flow of Vata in proper direction, which in turn aggravates and results into anovulation and oligomenorrhea as Prakrita Vata (balanced Vata Dosha) is responsible for proper menstruation. Hence, the treatment should be planned to correct Agni, eliminate vitiated excessive Kapha Dosha and correct Vata Dosha by providing proper movement of Vata. To eliminate vitiated Dosha and to improve Agni, Samshodhana Chikitsa (bio purification) is a preferred treatment in Ayurveda.

Further Ikshwaaku seed formulation was preferred for Vamana Karma as it is specifically mentioned for Kapha and Granthi Vikara (cystic masses).[10] As PCOS is metabolic disorder, Vamana helps to increase metabolism of body, thereby reducing weight and specifically act on liver metabolism which is the main site of hormone formation. Furthermore, there is direct relation of estrogen and obesity. Weight loss can improve not thus increased only circulating androgen and glucose levels but also helps for ovulation and thus increases pregnancy rate in obese women with PCOS.[11]

After Samshodhana (bio purification) to correct the residual pathology, Shatapushpadi Ghanavati was selected which was prepared using known Kapha Vatahara (pacifying Kapha and Vata Dosha), Agni Deepana (increases digestion), Artava Pravartaka (regularize menstruation) and Garbhashaya Shodhaka (detoxify and improves the function of uterus)drugs.

With respect to the pathology of PCOS, Ushna (hot), Tikshna (sharp), Ruksha (dry) and Lekhana (scraping) properties of the ingredients of Shatapushpadi Ghanavati normalizes Kapha vitiation and Vatavaigunya (vitiated Vata Dosha), reduces excess Meda (fat), removes Srotorodha/Sanga (blockage in micro-channels of the body) and creates normal functioning of Apana Vata (subtype of Vata which responsible for expulsion of waste) thereby regularizing the function of Aartavavaha Srotas as Prakrita Vata is responsible for proper menstrual flow.

Conclusion
Vamana Karma followed by Shatapushpadi Ghanavati is effective in regularizing menstruation, achieving considerable reduction in body weight and BMI, and helpful in lowering FBS level. Thus, this treatment protocol can be useful in the management of obese PCOS patients. Further, a large sample size study may help to support the findings of the study.
