==== Body
Sir,

The recent report on “Rasanjana Madhu Ashchyotana for a mucopurulent conjunctivitis” is quite interesting.[1] It can be shown that Rasanjana Madhu (RM) eye drops and Honey Rose (HR) water eye drops might be useful in management of mucopurulent conjunctivitis. However, there are many issues to be discussed. First, in this work, the subjects are few and the selection bias cannot be excluded. Second, the score system is too subjective and not validated. The interobserver variation cannot be controlled. Finally, the preparation of the eye drops requires a special pharmaceutical process to avoid the microbial contamination.
