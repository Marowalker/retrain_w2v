Sir,

The recent publication on Tailabindupariksha of the urine described a new alternative laboratory investigation technique.[1] This classic approach for urine examination might be a good alternative but the important information is lacking. At least, there should be a standard study on the comparative study (linearity between classical and standard urinalysis), diagnostic property (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and predictive values), and cost effectiveness. The classic method might also pose a problem in preparation for the test.
