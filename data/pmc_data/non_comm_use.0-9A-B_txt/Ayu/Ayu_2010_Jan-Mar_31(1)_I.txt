Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda is continuously enlightening the minds of researchers and giving quality education in the field of Ayurveda. The publication AYU is one of the media through which attempt is being made to globalize and publicize the researches made in the field of Ayurveda in this institute as well as outside on a wider platform. Nowadays more journals are being introduced in Ayurveda which is a good sign of development in view of quality and quantity of researches in Indian traditional medicine. This shows the increasing thirst and curiosity of the modern scientific community to record everything with a research view. Now it is a need of hour to have a self-realization for all ayurvedic persons in perspective of the challenges thrown from the modern society for the ayurvedic treatment of dreadful diseases like AIDS, swine-flue etc. Although researches are being made on ayurvedic drugs in different parts of the India, they are lacking in uniformity in research standards. The articles based on those particular topics may be referred to have a base for standardization of the research protocols throughout India and abroad. This will improve the impact of the research work for further updates in Ayurvedic medical science. In this way the link between the original idea from the classics, the actual research done in the form of data, the review of research and updates in the aspects may be well established and preserved. Day by day AYU Journal is also improving its shape, quality of contents to satisfy the requirements of research intellects. The journal has revived totally in the last few years and also appreciated by many scholars. It is now ready to take the heights of a standard reference journal.

It's a matter of great pleasure that AYU Journal is now available online for open access on its own website. This would definitely help the ayurvedic and modern scholars, academicians, to read, think, review and refer the contents of the journal freely. It will also be available as e-journal. This first issue of Volume 31 is more content rich including research articles from all eight specialties of Ayurveda along with new approaches towards standardization. We are thankful to all those authors, researchers, adjudicators, supporters who have made it possible to publish the journal with integrity and originality. As AYU is online now in the most simplified way, we invite all ayurvedic community to submit their ideas pursued in the form of research to publish it for open access in their minds. Again it gives a great feel to introduce Ayurveda in the new era of science with the application of technology. Long live AYU generation…
