The renaissance of the indigenous systems of medicine of India commenced over the century and a half ago. After establishing initial courses of Ayurveda in 1827 at Calcutta, efforts to revive Ayurveda have continued, in an increasing manner, all over India. To meet this need, the then central government appointed a committee, known as Bhore Committee to make a broad survey to know the position of health conditions in British India and to make recommendations for future developments. This committee made an extensive and critical survey and recommended measures for bettering the same, from the point of view of the modern medicine. Later, Chopra committee extended these recommendations for research and application of scientific methods for indigenous systems of medicine and opined to establish a Central Research Institute in Indian medicine to supervise, conduct and coordinate research into various aspects of Indigenous medicine. After reviewing the facilities available at various existing institutions in the country, unanimously it was proposed to set up the institute at Jamnagar in association with the Gulabkunwarba Ayurvedic Institution in the year 1953. Later, Gujarat Ayurved University was established in 1967 by an Act of Gujarat State Government.

The university offers a wide range of courses for the interested. There are 15 affiliated colleges/institutes. Institute for Postgraduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (IPGT and RA) provides education in Postdoctoral and Postgraduation levels of education in Ayurveda. These courses are recognized by Central Council of Indian Medicine, Government of India. In addition to these; IPGT and RA also offer courses in medicinal plants, Ayurveda Pharmacy, Introductory Course in Ayurveda, Certificate Course for Panchakarma Therapist, etc. Certificate courses of different levels in Yoga are being offered by Maharshi Patnajali Institute of Yoga and Naturopathy. Indian Institute of Ayurveda Pharmaceutical Sciences offers diploma and graduation level courses of Ayurveda Pharma Science. All these courses are well-accepted in India. Considering the increased global demand for Ayurveda, university also runs Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery and 3 months Introductory Course in Ayurveda for foreign nationals through International Center for Ayurveda Studies. The scholars trained from this university are competent throughout the world and are the guiding forces of research, education, and administration globally.

Since inception, the University engaged in activities related with the education, research, and attained unique achievements. Few of them are as below:

Considering the emergence of global demand of Ayurveda for healthy lifestyle, we are focusing on developing standardized methods of physical activity for health promotion of individuals and communities to generate public awareness regarding such practices. Designing standard treatment protocols, particularly for the management of lifestyle disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and anxiety disorders, etc., is also being focused.

Gujarat Ayurved University is first of its kind. It does not set out to prove or disprove anything. It explores and endeavors to discover the truth. We are sure; the initiatives of the University will pave a way to generate awareness in the scientific community and provide a platform to popularize usefulness and potentiality of Ayurvedic practices in global healthcare.
