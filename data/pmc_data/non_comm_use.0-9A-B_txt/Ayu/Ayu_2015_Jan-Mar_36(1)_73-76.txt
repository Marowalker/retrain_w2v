Blepharispermum subsessile DC. is a folklore medicinal herb, found in Odisha, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. It is locally known as Rasnajhadi in Odisha and its roots are being used as Rasna in treating rheumatic, gynecological, nervous disorders. In spite of its high medicinal as well as market values, the pharmacognostical characters of its root is not reported till date.

Aim:
To evaluate pharmacognostical and preliminary physico-chemical profiles of B. subsessile root.

Materials and Methods:
Roots of B. subsessile were collected from Odisha; its macroscopic, microscopic, powder characters and preliminary physico-chemical characters were studied following standard procedures.

Results:
Microscopically, outer multilayered lignified cork cells, cortex, border pitted xylem vessels, tracheids, isolated or groups of thick-walled xylem fibees were seen. Physico-chemical parameters showed that water soluble extractive value (31.3%) is more than alcohol soluble extractive value (23.2%) and 5.5 pH value, etc.

Conclusion:
The findings of the study will be useful in the identification and standardization of the B. subsessile root.

Introduction
India has rich floristic and ethnic diversity. Blepharispermum subsessile DC., an extra pharmacopeial folklore medicinal plant, is a “Healing herb,” known and marketed as Rasnajhadi in Odisha, is more frequent in the forests, north of Indravati river of Bastar District, distributed in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Odisha. An ethno botanical study reports the uses of its root in the management of various diseases. Socio-religious customs of Bastar region, i.e. Raj Gondas, Murias, Bhatra, uses decoction of Rasnajhadi, on 3rd day of menstruation and after delivery.[1] Decoction as well as powder of root is used in nervous disorders,[2] whole plant is used in Krimiroga (worms), Atisara (diarrhea) and Udarshula (stomach-ache),[3] rheumatic affections,[45] diarrhea,[6] skin diseases,[7] eye troubles, back ache due to rheumatism,[8] and irregular menstruation.[9] The pharmacognostical characters of its leaf[10] and stem[11] have been reported. In spite of its high medicinal as well as market value, the pharmacognostical characters of its root is not reported till date. Hence, the present study planned to evaluate pharmacognostical profiles of its root, which includes macroscopic, microscopic characters, and preliminary physico-chemical analysis.

Materials and Methods
Collection and authentification
Rasnajhadi, growing in Gurudongmar medicinal plants conservation area of Nuapada district of Odisha, India, was identified as B. subsessile DC. belonging to Asteraceae family on the basis of its morphological characters, comparing with the reported characters mentioned in Flora of Orissa,[12] and with the help of local taxonomist. The fresh plant sample was collected from its natural habitat during October 2011 and has been preserved with voucher specimen (no. 37325) in pharmacognosy laboratory. The collected plant samples were shaken to remove adherent soil and dirt. The roots were separated from the stem, washed under running fresh water. Few pieces were stored in the solution of alcohol: acetic acid: formalin in the ratio of (90:5:5)[13] to utilize them for microscopic studies. Remaining roots were washed, shade dried, powdered, passed through mesh no. 80, and preserved in an air-tight glass container and utilized for powder microscopy and preliminary physico-chemical analysis.

Pharmacognostic studies
Morphological characters were studied by observing the root as such and with the help of dissecting microscope. For detailed microscopical observation, free-hand thin transverse sections (TS) were taken, cleared with chloral hydrate, and observed for the presence of any crystals. Then, these sections were stained with phloroglucinol and conc. hydrochloric acid to notice lignified elements such as fibres and vessels.[14] Photographs of the sections were taken with the help of Canon digital camera attached to Carl Zeiss trinocular microscope. Powder characters were observed with above mentioned methods.

Physico-chemical evaluation
The dried sample of the root was used for the preliminary physico-chemical investigations by the standard procedure adopted from Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API).[15]

Results and Discussion
Macroscopic examination
Drug consist of cylindrical unbranched straight or slightly bent or tortuous pieces of roots, 2.5–5.5 cm in length and 0.3–0.5 cm in diameter, longitudinally ridged, wrinkled and fissured, show few transversely running lenticels, transversely cracked at places exfoliated exhibiting the inner narrow yellow wood. Fracture is short, externally earthy brown in color, internally yellowish. Some pieces show the crown with cluster of aerial stem arising from its upper surface and roots from the lower surface [Figure 1].

Microscopic examination
Diagrammatic TS of the root is circular in outline with irregular margins, show outer cork, cortex and phloem, xylem abruptly interpreted with phloem, and makes second layer of xylem towards the center.

Detailed TS shows, outermost cork cells which are dark brown, suberized, compressed, and running irregularly; middle cork cells lying underneath, these are lignified, 3–4 layered, and square; innermost cork cells consist of narrow suberized cells which are compressed and running tangentially. Cortex is narrow, parenchymatous, and embedded at places with simple starch grains. Phloem consisting of 7–10 rows, consisting of phloem parenchyma, sieve tubes and companion cells, traversed with isolated lignified thin walled stone cells, and oil cells embedded with yellowish brown coloring matter. At places, phloem penetrates inside the xylem and embedded with isolated thick-walled fibres. Xylem is wide consisting of xylem vessels, which are isolated or in group, medullary rays are multiseriate, getting wider at places, and occasionally shows cleft in them. Patches of interxylary phloem and intervascular pits are traversing throughout the xylem and are embedded with isolated fibres. Inner toward the center, band of xylem forming ring along with parenchyma and some fibers followed by band of phloem leads into anomalous growth, leaving centrally some parenchyma cells heavily filled with tannin material [Figures 2 and 3].

Powder microscopy
Organoleptic characters of powder show brownish black color, aromatic odor, oily and bitter taste, and rough touch.

The diagnostic characters of B. subsessile root powder shows, multilayered lignified cork cells in surface view, cork in transversely cut view, phloem parenchymatous cells embedded with fibres, longitudinally cut fragments of border pitted xylem vessels and tracheids, radially cut medullary rays crossing the xylem vessels, tracheids and isolated or groups of thick-walled xylem fibers, prismatic crystals, and tannin content [Figure 4].

Preliminary physico-chemical analysis
Physico-chemical parameters of B. subsessile root showed total ash (4.05%), acid insoluble ash (0.5%), water soluble extractive value (31.3%) more than alcohol soluble extractive value (23.2%), and acidic pH 5.5 [Table 1].

Conclusion
Diagnostic characters of root of B. subsessile DC. showed outer multilayered lignified cork cells, xylem abruptly interpreted with phloem, interxylary phloem, border pitted xylem vessels, intervascular pits, multiseriate medullary rays, tracheids, prismatic crystals, and tannin. The results of pharmacognostical and physico-chemical parameters can be considered as reference standards in the further studies.
