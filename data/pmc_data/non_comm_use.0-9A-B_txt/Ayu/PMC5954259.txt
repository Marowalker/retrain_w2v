Dear Editor,

The music therapy is accepted as a new modality in naturopathy management. Burns et al. mentioned that “Music therapy was associated with perceptions of meaningful spiritual support and less trouble breathing.[1]” Here, the authors would like to discuss on “Srpayya,” praying song in Buddhism and its possible application for controlling of respiration problem. For the Buddhist people living in the remote area of developing countries, they might have little knowledge and not influent read the book. However, singing song is a basic activity that anyone can easily practice. “Srpayya” is the basic type of song using as praying song for Buddhist prayer in Indochina. It is approved that Buddhist praying is a useful technique that can be integrated for management of several health problems (such as drug dependence[2]). Praying during meditation is proved to be useful for controlling of respiration.[3] Praying is also proved to be a useful relaxation tool that can have a great effect on several conditions including to postoperative crisis.[4] However, praying might be sometimes difficult. The use of “Srpayya” which is a kind of applied musical rhythm for singing basic praying text can be a new useful approach for management of disease. At least, singing a song can be a training technique to help for improving respiration and might be helpful for management of respiratory problem. Further studies on this concept are planned.
