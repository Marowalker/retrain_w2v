The starch obtained from the rhizomes of two plants, is used as Tugaksheeree, Curcuma angustifolia (CA) Roxb. (Family: Zingiberaceae) and Maranta arundinacea (MA) Linn. (Family Marantaceae). In the present study, a comparative physico-analysis of both the drugs has been carried out. The results suggest that the starch from CA and MA has similar organoleptic characters. The percentage of starch content is higher in the rhizome of CA when compared with that of MA and the starch of MA is packed more densely than the starch in CA. The chemical constituents of both the starch and rhizomes are partially similar to each other. Hence, the therapeutic activities may be similar.

Introduction
Tugaksheeree is as an important ingredient in many Ayurvedic formulations such as Chyavana Prasha,[1] Bala Ghrita,[2] Dadimashtaka Churna,[3] Pippalyadi avaleha,[4] Talisadya Churna,[5] Lavangadi Churna[6] etc.

Starch obtained from the rhizomes of Curcuma angustifolia (CA) Roxb. (East Indian Arrowroot) and Maranta arundinacea (MA) Linn. (West Indian Arrowroot) are presently used as botanical source of Tugaksheeree[789] [Figures 1–6].

Until date no research work has been carried out on comparing physico-chemical profiles of the above two plants. Hence, the study has been taken up to evaluate the test drug samples under organoleptic and physicochemical parameters.

Materials and Methods
The rhizome powders and starches of the drug samples CA and MA were collected in the month of December from Purva Mandala District of Madhya Pradesh and Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka respectively in the month of December and authenticated in the Pharmacognosy Department of Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar.

The samples were analyzed by using different organoleptic, qualitative and quantitative analyses of drug samples. A chromatography study and ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometric analysis were also carried out.

Organoleptic characters
The organoleptic characters in corresponds to the Pancha Jnanendriya Pariksha mentioned in Ayurveda were noted such as color, odor, touch and taste of the samples.

Physicochemical parameters
Parameters like loss on drying, total ash, extractive values, determination of pH, volatile oil content, percentage of starch and bulk density study were determined by following the methods described in the standards.[101112]

Preliminary qualitative tests
The rhizome powders and water extracts (starch) were tested for starch (iodine test), carbohydrates, cyanogenic glycosides, reducing sugar, cardiotonic glycosides, saponins, steroids, resin and flavonoids.[1314] Along with the estimation of starch was also carried out.[15]

Chromatographic study
Thin layer chromatograpy (TLC) and high performance thin layer chromatograpy (HPTLC) of rhizome powders and starches of both CA and MA were carried out.[1617]

UV visible spectrophotometric analysis
The UV spectra were recorded on a Comeg TLC scanner III in situ mode after HPTLC development.

Plates were developed by the selected solvent system i.e., dichloro methane:benzene:diethyl ether (0.5:4.0:0.5) and dichloro methane only. After the development of the plates, using an air blower, they were observed under UV spectra.

Observations, Results and Discussion
The organoleptic characters of the rhizome powders of CA and MA samples are different. This may be because both belong to different family. However, the starches of both the plants have the similar organoleptic characters [Table 1].

Table 1 Organoleptic characters

Physicochemical parameters
The study shows higher loss on drying in the CA rhizome, i.e., 25.00% w/w and higher water extractive value, i.e., 4.00% w/w, indicating the presence of a substance with a higher water holding capacity and water soluble compounds having ionic properties. The presence of such types of components increases the microbial growth in the available favorable conditions. Hence, the shelf life period is shorter in comparison with the MA rhizome.

The low CA Ash value shows the presence of low inorganic materials, that is, salts. Moreover, the portion of water-soluble ash part was higher against MA [Table 2].

Table 2 Physicochemical parameters

Volatile oil content (0.30% v/w) was found only in the rhizome powder of CA. This may be responsible for its camphoraceous odor and bitter acrid taste [Table 2].

Percentage of starch
Was determined by the traditional and laboratory methods and it was observed that the rhizome of CA contained more starch in comparison with starch from the rhizome of MA.

Bulk density study
It was observed that the bulk density of both the rhizome powders were similar, that is, 0.45 g/cm3 and 0.50 g/cm3. The bulk density of the CA starch was 0.56 g/cm3 while that of MA starch was 0.71 g/cm3. This indicated that the starch of MA might be packed more densely than that of the CA starch [Table 3].

Table 3 Bulk density study

Phytochemical study
Preliminary qualitative tests
The preliminary phytochemical screening indicated the presence of starch, carbohydrates, saponin, terpinoid/sterols, resin and flavonoids in the rhizome powders of both CA and MA resin, starch and saponin were found in the starches of both CA and MA [Table 4].

Discussion
Starches of CA and MA have similar organoleptic characters. Physicochemical profiles show the presence of starch, carbohydrates, saponin, terpinoid/sterols, resin and flavonoids in the rhizome powders of both CA and MA resin, starch and saponin were found in the starches of both CA and MA shelf life period of the rhizome of CA is shorter in comparison with that of the MA rhizome due to higher loss on drying and higher water extractive value. Low ash value in CA shows the presence of low inorganic materials that is salts. Volatile oil content has been found in the rhizome powder of CA, which may be responsible for its camphoraceous odor and bitter acrid taste. The percentage of starch content is higher in the rhizome of CA in comparison with that of MA. The starch in MA is packed more densely than that of the CA starch. The chemical constituents of both the starch and rhizomes are partially similar to each other with the possibility of same components at 0.03 and 0.86 in plate no. 1 and at 0.38 in plate no. 2, based on the chromatographic study and UV spectrophotometric analysis.

Conclusion
The physicochemical profile of both the starches was found to be similar, because of the similar type of components present in CA and MA. Therefore, both the source plants can be used as substitutes for therapeutic purposes.
