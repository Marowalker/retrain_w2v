Hypothyroidism is one of the most common thyroid disorders in India, affecting one in ten adults. Although the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism are often considered simple, there are large number of people with this condition who are suboptimally treated. Due to wide spectrum of the disease and high prevalence in the society, the current issue was opted for study and its management by means of Ayurvedic principles.

Materials and Methods:
Fifteen eligible hypothyroid patients with serum thyroid-stimulating hormone >4.5 μIU/ml and serum T3 and T4 lower than their respective normal range were selected and treated with Triphladya Guggulu pills and Punarnavadi Kashayam (decoction) for 45 days. Patients were advised to discontinue any medicine they might be taking for the management of hypothyroidism to assess the unbiased effect of therapies.

Results:
Significant improvement was observed on subjective parameters, but the results on objective parameters were statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). Of the 15 enrolled patients, excellent improvement was observed in 33.33% of the patients, while marked improvement was reported by 53.33% of the patients, moderate improvement was found in 6.66% of the patients and same number of patients, that is, 6.66% showed mild improvement. Moreover, few interesting observations were noted 4 months after completion of the trial. Out of 15 patients registered, 86.66% had positive drug history for levothyroxine. After clinical trial, 6.66% of the patients continued their previous dosage of levothyroxine, while 80% of the patients had withdrawn their hormone replacement therapy.

Conclusion:
Triphladya Guggulu and Punarnavadi decoction are effective in the management of hypothyroidism.

Introduction
The incidence of thyroid disorders in India is high, with hypothyroidism being a condition that is not adequately controlled in the country at present. Lack of thyroid hormone or resistance of the body tissue to thyroid hormone with respect to metabolic demand results in disorder called hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is required for the normal functioning of each and every tissue of the body. Hence, its deficiency manifests as multisystem involvement. It is estimated that about 42 million people suffer from thyroid disorders in India, of which hypothyroidism is most common with a prevalence of 5.4%.[1] The modern system of medicine is still exploring medicine for better and more effective management of hypothyroidism. Synthetic thyroid hormone derivatives may bring the value of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 to normal range, but the increased dosage and continuous medicine make the patient drug dependent till the end of the life. Even after years of treatment, it is associated with failure to provide relief in clinical manifestations. Moreover, excessive thyroid hormone replacement carries the potential for serious long-term metabolic complications (e.g., accelerated osteoporosis).[2]

The major function of the thyroid gland is to act as a spark for the maintenance of oxidative metabolism in most tissues. In Ayurveda parlance, this is attributed as the function of Agni (system related to metabolism). As far as the management of hypothyroidism through Ayurveda is concerned, hormonal replacement is not possible through drugs. However, one can interpret the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism in the context of Ayurveda, in which role of Agni is foremost and through its management, wholesome normal activity of the thyroid gland may be achieved. The objective of treatment should be to address the problem at its root by regulating the immune system and decreasing inflammation. Srotoshodhana (cleansing of the macro and microchannels), Agnideepana (stimulation of the digestion and metabolism), Pachana (digestion) and Vatanulomana (proper regulation of excretory system) are the main principles of treatment.

The trial drug Punarnavadi Kashayam[3] is mentioned in Chakradatta for the management of Shotha (odema), which is one of the common manifestations of hypothyroidism. It contains Punarnava, Devadaru and Shunthi along with Guggulu. Triphladya Guggulu[4] is cited in Yogaratnakara for the management of Gandamala. It contains Guggulu in combination with Trikatu, Triphala and Kanchanara. The drug possesses Deepana-Pachana Dravya along with Kanchanara, which is widely being practiced for the management of hypothyroidism. Thus, keeping in mind the possible effects of trial drugs in normalizing the impaired Agni, they were selected to evaluate their efficacy in the management of hypothyroidism.

Materials and Methods
Selection of patients
A total of 15 patients suffering from hypothyroidism were selected from outdoor patient department and indoor patient department of Panchakarma, IPGT & RA, Jamnagar, irrespective of their sex, religion, caste, occupation etc.

Discussion
In most cases of hypothyroidism, a specific cause is not apparent. It is believed that hypothyroidism is usually secondary to an autoimmune reaction.[6] In autoimmune disorders, the immune system cells do not recognize the cell as “self” and mount an immune response against them. This self-attack by the immune system increases inflammation and inflammation has a profound effect on all aspects of thyroid metabolism and physiology. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can inhibit type 2 5’- deiodinase enzyme activity which is required for the conversion of T4 to T3.[7] Inflammation causes elevated cortisol levels, leading to a decrease in TSH and lowered thyroid hormone production. Cortisol also inhibits the conversion of T4 to active T3 and increases the conversion of T4 to reverse T3.[8] Thyroid hormones stimulate diverse metabolic activities in most tissues, leading to an increase in basal metabolic rate. By way of analogy, the action of thyroid hormones is akin to Agni. The cause of disease, that is, impaired metabolism can be compared with Agnimandya.

Discussion on effect of therapy on thyroid profile
Out of 15 patients in the present trial, 10 patients had encouraging results in thyroid profile, not much change in thyroid profile was observed in 2 patients but the result worsened in 3 patients. On retrospective analysis, it was observed that patients whose thyroid profile had worsened during the trial had Vata-Kapha Prakriti, which can make the disease condition difficult to treat, due to the Vata-Kapha predominance in disease. Chronicity in those cases was reported to be more than 5 years. All of them had positive history for intake of levothyroxine. Chronicity and past treatment history can also be considered as one of the factors for negative results. Stress was a common factor in all these patients. One of these patients was a case of hypothyroidism caused after the treatment for Grave’s disease and in patients who develop hypothyroidism after the treatment of Graves’ disease, there is often an underlying autonomous function, necessitating lower replacement dose. This might be the reason why thyroid function worsened in this patient. The half-life elimination of thyroxine (T4) in hypothyroid patients is 9–10 days.[9] Half-life (abbreviated t½) is the time required for a quantity to reduce to half its initial value, but the washout period in the present trial was 7 days, this reflects that before treatment thyroid profile was under the influence of levothyroxine, whereas after treatment, the change in thyroid profile was solely under the influence of trial interventions.

Recovery of the hypothalamic–pituitary axis usually requires 8 weeks at which time the TSH and free T4 levels can be measured,[10] that is, TSH responses are gradual and should be measured about 2 months after instituting treatment.[11] However, the duration of the trial was limited to 6 weeks. Despite the short duration of the clinical trial, positive changes were observed in thyroid profile in 10 of 15 patients.

Thus, from the above observations, it can be inferred that both the trial drugs were helpful in normalizing the thyroid function, but better results could have been possible if the duration of trial was longer.

Mode of action of trial drugs
In hypothyroidism, etiological factors mainly vitiate Tridosha (Kapha predominance associated Pitta vitiation and Margavaranajanya [hindrance of function] leading to provoking of Vata). This Tridosha vitiation invites derangement of Jatharagni (digestive system), ultimately leading to the derangement of Dhatvagni (metabolic system) and subsequent appearance of Ama. This Ama blocks the channels in the body (Srotorodha), thereby afflicting the contents of channels causing vitiation of Srotasa as well as Dhatu to which these Srotas deliver.

The trial drug Triphaladya Guggulu is cited in Yogaratnakara Gandamala Chikitsa consists of Guggulu in combination with Trikatu, Triphala and Kanchanara. Punarnava Guggulu possesses digestive property to normalize excretory function, scraping of vitiated Meda with non-desirable Dhatu and Vata-Kapha pacification properties. Trikatu is known to have digestive and Vata-Kapha pacification properties. Digestive drugs prevent the formation of Ama, thereby preventing damage by keeping balanced state of digestion and metabolism. Triphala has Tridosha pacification properties and supports healthy digestion and absorption.

Punarnavadi decoction mentioned in Chakradatta Shotha Chikitsa contains Punarnava, Devadaru and Shunthi along with Guggulu as an adjuvents. The roots of Punarnava are claimed to possess diuretic and laxative[12] properties and thus might have been functional in alleviating swelling, the most common presenting complaint. Devadaru possesses anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory and diuretic properties.[13] Vitamin C is an active component of Devadaru.[13] Studies have shown that natural antioxidant therapy such as Vitamin C can reverse thyroid damage and prevent adverse effects to health by optimizing thyroid function.[14] Moreover, Devadaru has Lekhana action. These properties of Devadaru might have helped in reducing weight.[13] Shunthi owns digestive, pain-alleviating and Vata-Kapha pacification properties, preventing the formation of Ama. Preventing the formation of Ama can correct the pathogenesis at the beginning itself.

Few observations noted after the trial
Out of 15 registered patients, 86.66% had positive drug history for consumption of levothyroxine. After clinical trial, 6.66% of the patients continued their previous dosage of levothyroxine, while 80% of the patients had withdrawn their hormone replacement therapy. Not all the 80% of the patients who had withdrawn levothyroxine could restore normal thyroid profile, but they were quite satisfied with Ayurvedic management and were not willing to resume previously on-going synthetic thyroxin. These observations were noted 4 months after the completion of the clinical trial. An additional observation was that on long-term follow-up, thyroid profile showed a trend toward normalcy even in the cases that could not restore normal thyroid profile during the trial.

Conclusion
Although any disease condition is not described in Ayurveda which is similar to hypothyroidism, it is found to possess a strong correlation with Agnimandya and Ama. The trial drugs showed highly significant results on subjective parameters. Vitiation of Dhatvagni once created cannot be corrected easily; hence, Shamana therapy should be administered for sufficient time to cure Ama at Dhatu level. From the clinical trial, it can be concluded that Triphaladya Guggulu and Punarnavadi decoction are effective in the management of hypothyroidism.
