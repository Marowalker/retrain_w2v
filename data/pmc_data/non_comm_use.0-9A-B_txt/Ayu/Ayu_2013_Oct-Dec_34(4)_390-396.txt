Obesity leads to adverse metabolic effects on blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, and insulin resistance. Present study was planned to assess the role of Agnimanthadi compound containing Agnimantha, Mustaka, Gomutra (cow's urine), and Eranda Patra Kshara and Vashpa Svedana (VS) (generalized steaming) in the management of obesity. 80 patients of Sthaulya (obesity) were selected out of which 67 completed the treatment and they were treated in two groups. Amongst these, 38 patients were treated with Agnimanthadi compound in the dose of 2 gram (four capsules of 500 mg) 3 times a day with lukewarm water before meal and remaining 29 patients were given VS only. The duration of treatment in both groups was 7 weeks with follow-up for 2 months after the completion of treatment. Analysis of the overall effects of both the groups showed that VS provided marked reduction in weight, body mass index, and other signs and symptoms in patients of Sthaulya in comparison to the Agnimanthadi treated group.

Introduction
Following the trend of other developing countries that are steadily becoming more obese, obesity has reached epidemic proportions in India in the 21st century, with morbid obesity affecting 5% of the country's population.[1] The main reason behind peak rise in obesity may be change life style and unhealthy food habits. Further, Indians are genetically susceptible to weight accumulation especially around the waist. Obesity according to Ayurveda is included under eight undesirable conditions, and the main causative factor for it is Ati Santarpana (high calorie intake).[2] Moreover, Sushruta has emphasized on metabolic disturbances in the etio-pathogenesis of Sthaulya.[3] Looking in to the facts of pathogenesis of Sthaulya mentioned in classical texts, it can be said that the drugs, which decreases satiety, corrects the functions of Bhutaagni and Dhatvaagni (metabolism) and at the same time have weight or fat or cholesterol reducing actions (Medohara, Kaphahara), may be suitable for the management. Considering these facts, Agnimanthadi compound was formulated. In clinical practice, it is observed that Agnimantha produces burning sensation, hence, Eranda (Ricinus communis Linn.) Patra Kshara was added in the compound, which is reported to have fat reducing with digestion, and metabolism stimulating actions.[4] In the other group, Vashpa Svedana (VS) Karma was selected to assess its role in the management of obesity. Svedana (sudation) possesses both Vata and Kapha pacifying properties[5] Medohara (fat reducing) and Srotoshodhana (channel cleaning action).[6] Care has to be taken that the patient may not develop dehydration due to excessive sweating, which might have been one of the reasons for not prescribing Svedana in obese patients in classics. Further, if sudation is given in the form of Vashpa Svedana then it may provide relief to the patient but may not cause dehydration because moisture of steaming may help in preventing of any complication due to excessive sudation. Taking all these points, the present clinical trial was planned with an aim to evaluate the efficacy of Agnimanthadi compound and Vashpa Svedana in the management of Sthaulya and to compare the effects of the above two therapies and to ascertain which is a better option for the management of Sthaulya.

Materials and Methods
A total of 80 patients of Sthaulya attending the outpatient department and inpatient department of PG Hospital, IPGT and RA, Gujarat Ayurveda University, Jamnagar was registered for this study. Out of these, 13 patients dropped out, and 67 patients completed the prescribed course of treatment.[7]

Plan of study
An open label clinical trial was conducted on patients, where patients were given treatment for seven weeks with 2 months follow-up. Patients were given specific instructions on diet and life style modifications.

Criteria of diagnosis
The preliminary diagnosis was mainly based on the clinical presentation as mentioned in the texts but confirmed by the findings of body mass index (BMI) adopted internationally. BMI was calculated on the basis of height and weight of each patient. Standard range of normal body weight in relation to height mentioned by Life Insurance Corporation of India was adopted. An international criterion for BMI (Bray, 1976)[8] was used to calculate the BMI by the following formula: BMI = weight (kg)/height (meter).

Inclusion criteria

Patients of both sexes in the age group of 16 to65 years were selected for the present study

The patients having BMI between 30 to 45.




Exclusion criteria

Obese patients suffering from hypothyroidism, obesity due to hormonal imbalance, cardiovascular diseases, hemiplegia, associated with severe hypertension and from other such diseases in which the patient cannot do his routine physical activities were excluded

Very obese patients having BMI more than 45.




Investigations
Lipid profile was carried out in all the patients before initiating the administration of trial drugs and after the completion of course of treatment, while fasting blood sugar was carried out in suspected cases only. Routine investigation of blood and urine were also done to rule out other pathologies and to judge any adverse effect of the drugs.

Criteria of assessment

Weight and height were recorded before starting the treatment and later on every week of the study. Weight was also recorded of all the patients who had come for the follow-up study

Circumferences of fatty parts (chest, abdomen, hip, mid arm forearm and mid thigh) were recorded before and thereafter every week, till the completion of the course of treatment, to assess the effect of therapy

The skin fold thickness was measured by Vernier calipers before and after treatment in fixed areas of middle portions of the biceps and triceps muscles, middle portion of the supra iliac region and the anterior surface of mid thigh region and of abdominal muscle at umbilicus

Walking time: The time taken to climb fixed number of stairs in seconds was taken as walking time. This was done before and after the completion of full course of treatment.




The symptoms were assigned definite score and were assessed before and after the treatment. Paired “t” test was applied for the statistical analysis of the results. Moreover, assessment of Dosha, Dushya, and Srotasa based on their dominant symptoms was also carried out.

For Vashpa Svedana
Blood pressure and body temperature were measured by taking readings just before administrating Vashpa Svedana and then four readings were taken during administration of Vashpa Svedana daily to assess the short term or reversible effects of Vashpa Svedana. For this purpose first reading was taken just before starting of Vashpa Svedana and thereafter two readings at the interval of about 7 min during the process of Svedana and last just before completion of the process.


Latency of sweating in Vashpa Svedana was measured by noting the time taken to wet a blotting paper of 2 cm size kept on forehead

Body weight was recorded before administration of Vashpa Svedana and just after completion of Vashpa Svedana every day to know the immediate effect of Vashpa Svedana.




Groups division and treatment
The 67 patients were randomly divided into two groups’ viz., Vashpa Svedana group and Agnimanthadi group. The 29 patients of Sthaulya were treated in the Vashpa Svedana group and 38 patients were treated in Agnimanthadi group.


Vashpa Svedana (VS) group: Patients of this group were given Vashpa Svedana, till the appearance of Samyak Svedana Lakshana (proper sudation) once a day for 3 weeks. Thereafter, one course of 3 weeks was repeated, with a gap of a week, thus making total duration of treatment of 7 weeks

Agnimanthadi group: Patients of this group were administered Agnimanthadi compound in the dose of 2 g (four capsules of 500 mg) 3 times a day with lukewarm water before meal for a period of 7 weeks.




Method of preparation of drug
Agnimanthadi compound comprises of four drugs namely Agnimantha, Mustaka, Eranda Patra Kshara, and Gomutra (cow's urine). First of all, fine powders of Agnimantha and Mustaka were taken in equal quantity. This mixture was given seven Bhavanas (trituration) of Gomutra. The 16 parts of Gomutra Bhavita Agnimantha and Mustaka were then added to one part of Eranda Patra Kshara. This compound was filled in the capsules.

Method of Vashpa Svedana
Purva Karma
Patients were given Vashpa Svedana by using Vashpa Svedana Yantra (sudation chamber), a special box type of table having 6.5 feet length, 2.5 feet breath, and 2 feet height, with provision to keep head outside and multiple holes on the top of table so that vapors can easily come out of the box. Under this table, a utensil containing Dashamula Kvatha filled up to 3/4th of its capacity was kept on gas hot plate and heated to get continuous vapors.

Approximately 8 liter of water in a vessel was taken and half kg Dashamula Kvatha Dravya was put and heated to give vapors. When the steam was produced the door of Vashpa Svedana Yantra was closed. Abhyanga (massage) prior to the Vashpa Svedana was not done in the present study.

Pradhana Karma (main procedure)
The patient was made to lie down on Vashpa Svedana Yantra with head kept outside the box and body covered with cloth. Sudation of the whole body was allowed while patient changes four positions by rotating, that is, lying on back, right lateral, lying on chest and left lateral till the sign and symptoms of proper sudation such as perspiration over the forehead and increased body temperature were produced.

Paschat Karma (postoperative procedures)
After Samyaka Svedana (proper sudation) patient was covered with a blanket and was allowed to take rest for about 15 minute in a close room. After taking a warm bath, patient was permitted to take meal.

Assessment of overall effect of the therapy
For the overall assessment of the therapy following eight categories were taken into consideration:


Complete remission: The 100% relief in the signs and symptoms, along with reduction in body weight up to normal range, for that particular height in comparison of age, was considered as complete remission

Marked improvement: More than 75% improvement noted in signs and symptoms, along with more than 75% weight reduction, was considered as markedly improved

Moderate improvement: The 50-74% improvement was noted in the sign and symptoms along with more than 50% weight reduction were considered as moderate improvement

Improvement: If 25-49% improvement was noted in the sign and symptoms along with more than 25% weight reduction, then it was considered as an improvement

Slight improvement: Less than 25% relief in sign and symptoms along with less than 25% weight reduction was considered as slight improvement

Unchanged: No effect in sign and symptoms along with no change in weight was considered as unchanged

Deterioration: Increase in signs and symptoms or appearance of new symptoms or increase in weight was considered as deterioration

Change of score: If improvement was noted in sign and symptoms, but no improvement or mild increase of weight was recorded then one step down improvement was assigned. Same was followed vice-versa.




Follow-up study
After completion of due course of treatment, all the patients were asked to report for follow-up study for the period of 2 months every fortnight. In follow-up study changes in body weight, chest circumference, hip circumference, abdomen circumference, abdomen skin fold measurement (SFM), and hip SFM were observed.

The overall effect showed that Agnimanthadi compound provided moderate relief in 5.26% patients, Improvement in 13.16% patients and slight improvement in 63.16% patients. In this group 5.26% patients remained unchanged and 5.26% patients were further deteriorated [Figure 2].

Figure 2 Overall effects of therapies

In follow-up study, highly significant reduction (P < 0.001) in body weight was observed in 1 month follow-up. However, this significant reduction was not sustained in the 2nd month of follow-up study.

Effect of Vashpa Svedana group
Vashpa Svedana caused a significant reduction in body weight by 1.61 kg (1.9%) and in BMI by 1.88% [Table 1, Figure 3]. It provided significant relief in the symptoms of Daurbalyata (76.31%), Daurgandhyata (69.62%), Nindradhikya (63.95%), Sandhi Shoola (62.73%), Aysena Shvasa (60.14%), Snigdha Angata (58.62%), Anga Gaurava (58.10%), Gatra Sada (55.07%), and Svedabadha (50.48%) [Table 2] and in the symptoms of Srotodushti of Rasavaha Srotasa (63.50%) and Svedavaha Srotasa (48.39%), [Figure 1]. It also significantly reduced the pulse rate by 2.76%, circumferences of midarm (2.33%), abdomen (1.19%), chest (1.12%), and hip (1.0%) [Table 3] and SFM of midthigh SFM (0.55%) [Table 4]. It significantly reduced the eosinophil count (16.3%), serum triglyceride (7.5%), and serum LDL (3.26%) [Table 5, Figure 3]. In total effect, Vashpa Svedana provided slight improvement in 34.5% of the patients while 31.03% patients each were reported with moderate improvement and improvement. Marked improvement was found in only 3.45% of the patients [Figure 2]. In follow-up of the treated patient, it was found that there was not statistically significant reduction in body weight and other body part circumferences, Skin Fold Measurement.

Comparative Efficacy
On comparing the results of both the groups, Vashpa Sveda (VS) group provided statistically highly significant and better relief than Agnimanthadi compound in symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, lethargy, generalized weakness, excessive sleep, excessive sweating, unctuous body parts, heaviness in the body and fatigue and Sroto Dushti Lakshana of Rasavaha, and Svedavaha Srotas (P < 0.001). It also provided statistically highly significant changes on BMI, body weight reduction, chest circumference, and abdomen circumference (P < 0.001) and decrease in serum LDL (P < 0.001). The therapy provided statistically significant changes in hip circumference, mid arm circumference, waist/hip ratio and mid thigh SFM (P < 0.01).

Whereas Agnimanthadi compound provided statistically highly significant and comparatively better changes in Annavaha Sroto Dushti, mid arm circumference, forearm circumference, mid thigh circumference, total SFM, walking time, serum cholesterol, and serum triglyceride. It also provided significant and better changes in biceps SFM, triceps SFM and suprailiac SFM.

On overall effect, Vashpa Svedana provided slight improvement in 34.5% of the patients while 31.03% patients were reported with moderate improvement and improvement. Marked improvement was found in only 3.45% of the patients. Whereas, Agnimanthadi compound provided moderate relief in 5.26% patients, Improvement in 13.16% patients and slight improvement in 63.16% patients. In this group, 5.26% patients remained unchanged, and 5.26% patients were further deteriorated [Figure 2].

Discussion
As per the hypothesis of the present trial, Vashpa Svedana provided statistically significant reduction on BMI and body fat content. It may due to the elimination of excess of water from the body and if this procedure is done properly it may also eliminate fats, as fat become water-soluble starting with 45°C heating.[9] Further, systemic thermal therapy, such as taking a warm water bath and sauna, induces systemic vasodilatation. Recent studies have revealed that vascular endothelial function is impaired in subjects with lifestyle-related diseases, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and smoking.[10] Giving of generalized steaming improves endothelial dysfunction in these subjects, suggesting its preventive role.[11]

Most of the drugs in Agnimanthadi compound are having metabolism stimulating and hypo-lipidemic actions. Katu (pungent), Tikta (bitter), Kashaya (astringent) Rasa, Katu Vipaka (post-digestion effect), Ushna Virya (hot in potency), Kapha-Vata Shamaka actions of these drugs may have normalized the state of Agni (metabolism); thus, causing a reduction in excessive formation and accumulation of fatty tissue. Further, Medohara (hypolipidemic) action of these drugs may have facilitated to remove excess fat from the body.

Conclusions
Results of the study conclude that the administration of VS to the patients of Sthaulya (obesity) provided comparatively better effect in almost all the parameters of Sthaulya. Further, none of the patients of Sthaulya developed any untoward symptoms during this full course of treatment. Hence, it can be concluded that though Svedana (sudation) is generally contraindicated in patients of Sthaulya, administration of VS in an appropriate manner can be one of the best therapy to such patients. It has been found in this study that when VS Yantra is used, it took about four minutes to initiate the sweating in obese persons. During the process of Vashpa Svedana significant increase in body temperature (approximately 3-4%) occurs which comes down to the normal limit within few minutes of its completion. During Vashpa Svedana process, slight increase (up to 1 mm) or decrease (up to 3 mm) in systolic blood pressure and a slight decrease (up to 3 mm) in diastolic pressure may occur. In obese persons, Vashpa Svedana may reduce the body weight ranging from 20 g to 90 g daily.
