Dear Dr. Katiyar,

I am neither trained nor an expert in Ayurveda which is an ancient science and a pride of India. Therefore, I shall refrain from making any drastic comment on your views. I am not sure what would have been my views if I were an Ayurvedic physician.

Nevertheless, I have been enjoying for a long time the privilege of associating myself in various scientific forums with some of the finest experts of this subject and you are one of them. In view of this fact, I may like to submit some of my views which you may find well founded.

After reading your article and with my research and other educational background, I feel inclined to support the second school of “stakeholders” who believe that there is a need for scientific scrutiny and validation of ancient Ayurvedic claims. The reasons put forward by you as to why there is a need for a scientific scrutiny are quite valid for a global acceptance of this system. However, it will be better if we could find a consensus between these two thoughts (hope there is no third front!). As far as the name “Ayurpathy” is concerned, it is quite novel. But if “Veda” is removed, it may lose some of its shine and start afresh as a new science. This much for the beginning, let us have some more debate on it. But still it is a good thinking.

Congratulations!

Dear Dr. Katiyar,

I wish to congratulate you for your article in which you have systematically and logically dissected issues relating to globalization of Ayurveda by promoting the concept of Ayurpathy. As a pharmacologist/biomedical researcher and a strong proponent of “integration of traditional and modern medicinal concepts,” I fully support your views on the subject matter. Concepts like “reverse pharmacology” and “systems biology approach” could play significant roles in this process.

Best regards,

Dear Dr. Katiyar,

I am happy to know of your efforts to give scientific base to Ayurveda and coin a new form “Ayurpathy.” You may call it “Ayurpathy-evidence based Ayurveda.”

Dear Dr. Katiyar,

Read your article. Interesting! Both Ayurveda and modern physiology recognize that health is achieved through balance and regulation of the internal systems. Ayurveda describes this regulation via the humoral concepts of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, whilst modern medicine determines it through chemical pathways and feedback mechanisms. They both have their place; it is knowing how and when to utilize each particular paradigm that is important. The need of the hour is to use modern technology to explore the relevance of these concepts so that they may be interpreted in the light of contemporary scientific language to offer modern health care. This is the hot discussion that is taking place in many forums today.
