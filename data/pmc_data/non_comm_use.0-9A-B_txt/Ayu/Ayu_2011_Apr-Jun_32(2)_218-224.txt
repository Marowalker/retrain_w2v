Introduction
Shitada is considered by Acaryas Susruta to come under ‘Dantamulagata Rogas’,[1] which is a group of the Mukha Rogas[2] and is characterized mainly by spontaneous bleeding from the gums, without any injury, and occurs due to vitiated Kapha and Rakta.[3] The symptomatology of Shitada can be compared with Gingivitis.[4]

Gingivitis, an inflammation of the gingiva, occurs widely in most populations, affecting both children and adults. The high prevalence of gingivitis is approximately 50%[5] in the general population.

Gingivitis is caused mainly by accumulation of debris, plaque or calculus on the teeth margin[6] mostly due to negligence of oral care. It is a state incompatible with good oral health. It can progress to more serious conditions like periodontitis, which is responsible for tooth loss, by altering the contour and position of the gingiva.[7] Gingivitis is reversible. With careful early treatment and good oral hygiene, gingival harmony can be restored.[8]

At present, the modern management of Gingivitis is not satisfactory, as mechanical removal of plaque and debris by scaling causes trauma to the gums; use of chemicals, that is, mouth wash, irrigation, and so on are expensive as well as time consuming, and the last treatment of choice is surgery, which is not completely safe in all cases. Therefore, prevention and the control of Gingivitis are essential in every case.

In Ayurveda; Susruta and other authors have recommended Bloodletting, Nasya, Pratisarana, Gandusa, and so on, in the management of Shitada. The importance of oral hygiene was well-known to the early Hebrews. The procedures for the cleanliness of oral cavity are a very important part of Dinacarya. The Acaryas have mentioned Dantadhavana, Gandusa, Kavala, Pratisarana, Jihvanirlekhana, and so forth, as a part of day-to-day life, to keep the oral cavity in a healthy state.[9]

It is a fact that if a person does not follow the rules of oral hygiene, he suffers from various MukhagataRogas. There is no doubt; that oral hygiene also has an important role in the maintenance of general body health, as infective focus in teeth can cause systemic diseases.[10]

Although, the prevalence of the disease Shitada is very high, very few studies have been carried out on Shitada as well as on the awareness of oral hygiene. A good number of patients present with gingivitis, to the Outpatient Department (OPD). Due to lack of oral care awareness, busy life, and no apparent difficulty; the patients ignore the disease and it progresses to advance stages.

In a clinical study, by Krishna Makadia, Dr. Manjusha R., et al., 2004, encouraging results with BhadramustadiCurnapratisarana and Gandusa with Nagaradikwatha for gingivitis, were reported.[11]

Ayurvedic medicines are undergoing drastic changes in the present era. Toothpaste is the most widely used form for dental disorders as well as for oral care. The powder form is inconvenient for the patients and has more chances of contamination from the atmosphere. Here an attempt has been made to convert it into the paste form, as a part of continuation of the above study, to compare the efficacy of the same medicine in a different form.

In the present study, Bhadramustadi yoga[12] is used in the paste form for local application with a soft brush, using the Bass technique[13] of brushing, along with the Nagaradi Kwatha[14] Gandusa in the Trial group, that is, Group A, whereas, in Group B the same Yoga is used in powder form for local application along with Nagaradi Kwatha as the standard control drug and Sphatikajala was used in control Group C.

Aims and objectives

To evaluate efficacy of Bhadramustadi paste and Gandusa with Nagradi Kwatha

To compare the efficacy of curna and paste form




Materials and Methods

The Nagaradi Kwatha was selected for Gandusa along with the application of toothpaste as well as Pratisarana. It was meant for oral hygiene supplementation therapy in the management of Shitada.

Ingredients
The ingredients of Nagaradi Kwatha are:



Follow up
A period of three months was planned for follow-up study, to evaluate the recurrence after treatment. Instructions regarding the special care of Ahara and Vihara were given and fibrous, non-sticky food like fruits, vegetables, and so on were advised.

Criteria for assessment of results
The effect of treatment was assessed subjectively by clinical observation, on the basis of relief in the signs and symptoms of the disease.The scoring pattern adopted for the study was prepared depending upon the severity of the symptoms like Akasmata Raktasrava (Bleeding gums), Sotha (Inflammation), Siryamana Dantamamsa (Gingival recession), Krisnata (Discoloration of gums), Daurgandhya (Halitosis), Vedana (Pain), Dantamamsa Mriduta (Sponginess), Dantamamsa Klinnata (Snigdhata), Paka (Pus discharge), and Caladanta (Tooth mobility). The scoring was given from 0 to 4 depending upon the severity. The patients were objectively accessed on the basis of the gingival index[15] and the bleeding index. Oral hygiene was assessed with the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index.[16]

Criteria for assessment of the total therapy
The total effect of the therapy was assessed on the basis of subjective and objective criteria and patients were grouped into the following five categories:



A total of 40 patients were registered for the present clinical study, out of them 33 patients completed the treatment and seven left the treatment against medical advice. The patients were divided into three groups by the random sampling method. In Group A 13 patients, Group B 10 patients, and in Group C 10 patients, completed the treatment.

In Group A the patients were advised to use Bhadramustadi paste with a soft toothbrush and brush twice per day, once in the morning and once in the evening, using the Bass method.

The trial drug, the Bhadramustadi paste, was prepared with Bhadramustadi Curna (100 mesh fine powder) 40% mixed with the common base of toothpaste 60%. Toothpaste was prepared at the pharmacy of Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar.

Disscussion
Shitada (Gingivitis) is highly prevalent in India as well as the rest of the world. It is caused mainly by plaque accumulation on the teeth due to lack of oral hygiene. Application of Bhadramustadi paste with toothbrush, using a proper method, can remove the plaque, reduce the swelling, and prevent the infection with its best therapeutic action. Gandusa is beneficial in the sodhana of the oral cavity. Retention of the medicine in the oral cavity loosens the calculus and gives a mechanical massage to the gingiva. Absorption of the drug reduces the infection. One-third of the patients in this series, that is, 33.33%, were found to be suffering from Shitada since the last 15 months or more. It indicates that the disease is chronic in nature. A maximum number of patients (93.94%) used tooth brush as a means to oral hygiene and 75.76% patients adopted horizontal brushing technique. The tooth brush can clean inter-dental areas, pits, fissures, and so on, provided the selection of the toothbrush and the brushing technique is proper. Due to lack of knowledge of the correct brushing technique, the plaque was not removed completely, therefore, proper selection of brush and technique should be explained to the patients. In Group C, that is the control Group, also mild improvement in sign and symptoms and also improvement in OHI was found. It indicated that proper brushing technique and oral hygiene was also important for the maintenance of oral health. Total effect of therapy has been depicted at Graph 1.

Conclusion
A conclusion can be drawn as follows from the study.


Eating fibrous and less sticky foods like fruits, pulses, vegetables, and the like keep the body healthy and preserve oral hygiene.

Oral care methods mentioned in ancient texts should be properly followed in a healthy condition as well as in a diseased condition.

There is need to increase awareness about oral hygiene in the society. Various programs for oral care methods with regard to its importance and diseases resulting from its negligence, in various age groups of the society, should be conducted.

In nutshell, it is concluded from this study that Bhadramustadi paste application with a soft tooth brush along with Nagaradi Kwatha Gandusa is more effective than Bhadramustadi Curna Pratisarana and Nagaradi Kwatha Gandusa in the management of Shitada (Gingivitis) as well as this therapy (Probable mode of action at Figure 1) is useful in removing and controlling plaque and calculus. Thus it is a better remedy for maintaining oral hygiene.
