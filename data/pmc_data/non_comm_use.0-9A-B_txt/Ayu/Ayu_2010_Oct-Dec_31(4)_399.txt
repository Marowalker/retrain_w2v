By the release of this issue, AYU completes one successful year of its online publication. The response to online version is outstanding because this has increased the new research papers’ submission and also increased the number of readers and subscribers, not only at the national level but also at the international platform. The time and energy in reviewing is also being saved due to advancement of online management system. The focus is now on greater dissemination of ancient wisdom with a scientific research perspective at a global platform. Recently, the Hon′ble Secretary, Department of AYUSH, has expedited the publication of Ayurvedic data on web by launching AYUSH portal. This is a very vital step toward globalization of Ayurveda because it will host the published as well as compilation works in all faculties of AYUSH on a single platform. We congratulate the team of The Secretary with the Joint Secretaries and Advisor-Ayurveda for their interest and efforts in rejuvenating the AYUSH systems in a new way.

The Government of India signed MoU with Malaysian Government for exchange of Ayurveda knowledge and recently sanctioned 20 scholarships for Malaysian students to study Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani degree courses in various reputed institutes in India. The excellent co-ordination between Dept. of AYUSH and Indian High Commission in Malaysia has resulted in the establishment of AYUSH cell in Indian Cultural Center (ICC) at Kuala Lumpur. It has made outstanding contribution in popularizing Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicine in Malaysia. Formation of AYUSH cell in ICC existing in other parts of the world will also make the people aware of AYUSH systems of medicine. This will encourage the propagation of Ayurveda and other AYUSH systems all over the world in the long term. Gujarat Ayurved University has always been an important stage in broadcasting Ayurveda at a global level. The university has signed MoU with various international organizations in countries like Japan, Argentina, Germany, The Netherlands, Israel, South Korea, France, and Canada. AYU has been the university's mouthpiece to publish research works carried out at and outside the institute. Recently, the Brazilian association of Ayurveda has requested to translate the published articles in AYU for the benefit of Brazilian practitioners of Ayurveda. This shows the increasing interest and awareness about Ayurveda among the global community.

The present issue of AYU is a treat to Ayurvedic scholars interested in clinical research, literary research, pharmacological and pharmaceutical standardization of Ayurvedic drugs. AYU is honored to publish the thoughts of Prof. V. J. Thakar, Founder Vice Chancellor of Gujarat Ayurved University, in the guest editorial with a note on “Historical development of basic concepts of Ayurveda from Veda up to Samhita”. Still at the age of 91 years, he is as young as Gujarat Ayurved University and has always been encouraging the promotion of Ayurveda. He has been a source of inspiration to the younger generation of Ayurveda. This issue further comprises 24 articles with 16 on clinical researches in various disciplines, 3 on pharmacological researches, 2 on pharmaceutical standardization and 3 literary review articles. We hope this knowledge in the form of nectar will be rejoiced by the Ayurvedic community and all.
