Vyanga is one of the Kshudraroga, characterized by the presence of Niruja (painless) and Shavavarna Mandalas (bluish-black patches) on face. It is one of the most common diseases as regards the face is concerned. On the basis of clinical features, it can be compared with facial melanosis, one of the hyper pigmented disorders. Drugs with Rakta Prasadaka, Twak Prasadaka and Varnyakara properties are helpful in the management of Vyanga, that pacifies aggregated Doshas and help in Raktashodhana (blood purification).

Aim:
To evaluate the efficacy of Arjunatwak Lepa and Panchanimba Churna in Vyanga.

Materials and Methods:
In this study, the trial drugs used were Arjunatwak Churna for Lepa (tropical application) and Panchanimba Churna for oral administration. A total 30 patients of Vyanga were selected from outpatient department and inpatient department of Shalakya Tantra Department and allotted randomly in two groups. In group-A, the patients were treated with external application of Arjunatwak Churna and Madhu for 21 days, while in group-B, patients received Panchanimba Churna orally for 21 days in addition to Arjunatwak Churna for Lepa. Effect of therapy on chief complaint i.e., bluish-black pigmentation in Group A was 60% relief, while in Group B 80% relief was found.

Conclusion:
The clinical study has shown that combined therapy gives better results than topical treatment.

Introduction
Smooth and glowing complexion of the face increases the beauty of a person and also gives self-confidence. Vyanga is a disease, which decreases the glowing complexion of the face and affects the skin. Among many diseases concerned with cosmetic values, Vyanga is common disease known to us from thousands of years. Though it is considered as Kshudra Roga (minor disease), has got a major importance as a cosmetic problem in the society. It is characterized by the presence of Niruja (painless), Tanu (thin) and Shavavarna Mandalas (bluish-black patches) on face,[1] occurs due to vitiation of Vata, Pitta followed by Rakta Dosha.[2] Treating this condition has become a problem, since safe drugs are not available for long-term therapy.

In modern medical science, topical steroids have been described in the management of facial melanosis.[3] However, the topical steroids are not completely free from adverse effects such as irritation, rashes.[4] Apart from this, generally the topical steroids are expensive and sometimes poor patients cannot afford this treatment. Hence there is a need to search better methods of management in facial melanosis considering the above drawbacks.

Ayurveda mentions a good number of medicines for skin care. Massage with oils, application of paste of medicines etc., makes the face smooth, soft and glowing.[5] In addition to this, bloodletting is also described.[6]

Drugs having Kusthaghna, Kandughna, Raktashodhaka, Twak Prasadaka and Varnyakara properties are helpful in the management and can produce cutaneous depigmentation that remove the blackish discoloration of skin.

Considering these points, Arjunatwak Churna was selected for Lepa[7] and Panchanimba Churna was selected for oral medication as these preparations have Kusthaghna, Kandughna, Raktashodhaka, Twak Prasadaka and Varnyakara properties.

Source of data
Patients, fulfilling the clinical criteria of Vyanga were randomly selected irrespective of their sex, religion, occupation, etc., from out-patient department and inpatient department sections of the Department of Shalakya Tantra, S.J.I.I.M Bangalore, Karnataka.

Nearly 56.67% of patients have patches on cheeks, nose and fore head. In 43.33% of patients, the color of patch was dark brown, in 33.33% it was blue-black and in 23.34% of patients it was light brown in color.

Discussion
Vyanga is explained as a Kshudra Roga in Ayurveda. While describing the etiological factors of Vyanga, Acharya has given special emphasis towards psychological factors like Krodha (anger), Shoka (grief) and Shrama (exhaustion), which are commonly found in most of the patients. In Samprapti of Vyanga, Acharya Charaka has mentioned that the aggravation of Pitta along with Rakta is the chief culprit for initiation of the pathology. Vyanga is a Rakta Pradoshaja Vyadhi,[9] hence the very first Dosha affected is Rakta Dhatu. Dosha Prakopaka Hetus like Krodha, Shoka and Shrama are mainly Tama (Manasika Dosha), Pitta and Vata (Shareerika Dosha) dominance,[10] vitiates the Agni (Pitta Dosha) which resides in Rasa and initiates the pathogenesis of Vyanga. Here Ranjaka Pitta is responsible for the conversion of Rasa Dhatu into Rakta Dhatu which results in the formation of normal skin color. However due to etiological factors like Krodha and Shoka mainly Pitta vitiation takes place which in turn affects the Jatharagni and normal functioning of Ranjaka Pitta i.e., Varnotpatti. Based on Ashraya-Ashrayee Bhavas, the derangement of Pitta Dosha leads to abnormality of Rakta Dhatu. Shrama and Shoka will lead to Udana Vata vitiation. Thus vitiated Ranjaka Pitta, Rakta Dhatu as well as Udana Vata travel in body through Dhamanis and get Sthana Samshraya in Mukhagata Twacha and causes vitiation of Bhrajaka Pitta giving rise to discoloration of the skin.

Mode of action of drug
The mode of action of the drug under trial can be understood on the basis of inherent properties of the drug.

Rasa of Arjunatwak is Kashaya Rasa,[11] Gunas are Laghu, Ruksha, Veerya is Sheeta and mainly having Pitta Shamaka and Rakta Prasadaka properties. With property of Kashaya Rasa, it will encounters Pitta and Rakta Dosha. The Kashaya Rasa removes the Twak Vaivarnyata and helps to attain the normal skin color.[1213] Due to Sheeta Veerya it encounters the Pitta Dosha. Prasadana property of Sheeta Veerya also helps to purify the accumulated Doshas in Vyanga. The Rakta Prasadaka and Twak Prasadaka actions of Arjuna help to pacify the Sanchita Doshas locally. In Panchnimba Churna almost all drugs like Nimba, Bakuchi[14] Araghwadha, Haridra, Chakramarda, Bhallataka etc., are having Rakta Prasadaka and Twak Doshahara properties. In Panchanimba Churna the main ingredient is Nimba that have Tikta, Kashaya Rasa and Laghu, Snigdha properties by which Pitta Shamaka action can be observed. Aragwadha[15] Amalaki[16] Maricha, Nimba and Haridra[17] are having Kusthaghna and Kandughna properties by which possibly significant efficacy was observed.

Conclusion
Both trial drugs showed encouraging results. Arjuna Twak along with Madhu has not shown any skin reactions, so it could be used safely. From the observations and results of this study, it can be concluded that Arjuna Twak Lepa along with Panchanimba Churna have provided better results in hyperpigmentation of the patches seen in cases of Vyanga.
