In the last several issues, AYU has been continuously focusing on the development of Ayurveda at micro as well as macro levels on local, national, and global platforms. AYU, being a research journal, has the prime objective to bring Ayurveda forward in the lights of research. It has grown and attracted the global research community tow ard Ayurveda. Fortunately, AYU gets articles from all specialties and we promote and publish each issue inclusive of researches from all faculties. Now it is the time to move a step forward. Publication is a post-research phase to make the research more authentic and acceptable by the society. However, for the development of Ayurveda, we need a multidimensional research wing which truly works in the field for uplifting the science in various angles. We need to sprout the resources from the present generation for future growth of Ayurveda. Ayurveda should be expanded in all specialties and each specialty must achieve the heights as has been done in modern medical science. The first post graduate center in Ayurveda was started in 1956 at Jamnagar. At present, in various institutes all over India, 14 specialties are running successfully; research scholars are carrying research under the supervision of subject experts. Post research, very few studies are published in standard research journals. This is the present scenario for specialty oriented research. But still substantial data has not been generated through this profound research. Why? Many issues including limited standard research infrastructure, lack of sufficient expert researchers, etc. make a sense toward the cause. The root may lie in the lack of integrated education with futuristic vision to generate linked data.

The specialties are working only to produce either expert academicians or expert clinicians, that too only in the clinical subjects of Ayurveda. Among the non-clinical subjects, Dravyaguna (Ayurvedic medicinal plants), Rasashastra, and Bhaishajya Kalpana (Ayurvedic pharmaceutics) are developed more due to the integration of modern allied science and technology. They have given Ayurveda an identity of “Herbalism” globally. Other subjects like Samhita-Siddhanta (basic principles), Sharira Rachana (anatomy), Sharira Kriya (physiology), etc. are still to be identified with their own landmark inventions. In clinical subjects, Kayachikitsa (internal medicine) has been developed the most by researches with a partial support of clinical pharmacology and modern research methodology. Panchakarma (bio-purification) is accepted throughout the world. The Balaroga (pediatrics) and Stree Roga Prasuti Tantra (gynecology and obstetrics) are still growing branches. Shalya Tantra (surgery) seems to be limited to anorectal surgery. Shalakya Tantra (ear, nose, throat, including dentistry and ophthalmology) is still under construction and limited to small number of stalwarts. As per this overview, if Ayurveda has to grow at a faster rate, we need to have integration between tradition and technology, with a focus on development of Ayurveda in various segments and compartments under the principles of holistic medicine. Ayurveda needs to get developed on the lines which modern medical science followed, but without losing its self-identity and integrity. Moreover, this synthesis should be made in such a way that the principles of Ayurveda are neither compromised nor allowed to be twisted.

Western conventional medicine is also a growing tree, but its branches are well defined and well differentiated. For example, an oncologist never interferes with the treatment of a psychiatrist. Still both are having a separate well-designed identity. Ayurvedic tree needs this clear differentiation and co-ordination. There is abundant scope of research at a baseline; however, the research must be well directed with a focus on to develop that separate branch. Very few Ayurvedic post graduates follow their own research topic in their future clinical practice or pursue the research on the drug they studied at post graduate level. It should be a part of their specialty practice subject to their own conviction. But it is a topic of discussion that what percentage of Ayurvedic scholars practices their own specialty. We are lacking to provide the scholars future security in their specialty. When would this happen?

To achieve these objectives, the growing tree of Ayurveda with strong foundation of roots should have strength in the beams of branches and co-ordination between the sub-branches. The nutrition of the Ayurvedic tree needs to be well addressed by the Government of India as well as the state governments. Focus on the present scenario should be made on the stem, specialties of Ayurveda, then on the super specialties. There is a scope to develop each specialty further depending upon the requirements of society.

World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 5–10% of the population at any given time is suffering from identifiable depression and needs psychiatric treatment or psychosocial intervention.[1] It is going to be the second largest disorder by the year 2020. But does Ayurveda have sufficient trained Psychotherapists or Ayurvedic Psychiatrists to conquer the problem? Is Ayurvedic education system not producing such healers? The prime national institutes in India like National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur, and Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda (IPGT & RA), Jamnagar are NOT running the specialty of Manasa Roga (which deals with mental health, psychosomatic, and psychiatric diseases). Only a few institutes, viz. Faculty of Ayurveda, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University under Department of Kayachikitsa, Varanasi, UP; SDM college of Ayurveda, Hassan, Karnataka; and Ayurveda College, Kottakal, Kerala are running this specialty. The specialty of Manasa Roga was started in IPGT and RA, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar, and the first batch of post graduates in Manasa Roga passed out in 1998. Running successfully for nearly 10 years, unfortunately, it has been suspended since 2009 with a reason of lack of proper infrastructure as per the norms of modern psychiatric hospitals. The major reason may be lack of secure future of Ayurvedic psychiatrists in academia. Neither the Central Council for Indian Medicine (CCIM) gives security to this specialty, nor does the institutes take initiative to develop separate infrastructure for the purpose. If the institutes of national stature are unable to sprout the prime areas in Ayurveda, then what can be talked about the others? After 55 years of starting post graduate courses, we should be strong enough to germinate resources in each specialty. Academia and research are for basic theoretical development of Ayurveda. Clinical practice is for its application and benefit to the society. Unless and until the theories are applied in practice and made beneficial to the society, the true goal is not accomplished.

It is again a welcome step by CCIM vide Indian Medicine Central Council (Post-graduate Diploma Course) Regulations 2010 to start post graduate diploma courses in nearly 16 sub-specialties, viz. Panchakarma (bio-purification), Kshara Karma, Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics, Twak Roga (dermatology), Ayurvedic Dietetics, Swasthavritta and Yoga, Prasuti evam Striroga, Balaroga, Ayurvedic Pharmacognosy and Standardization (Dravyaguna Vijnana), Manasika Swasthya (mental health), Netraroga Vijnana (ophthalmology), Rasayana and Vajikarana (rejuvenation and aphrodisiac), Ayurvedic Sangyahara (anesthesiology), Chhaya evam Vikiran Vijnana (radiology), Marma evam Asthi Chikitsa (orthopedics), and Roga Nidan Vidhi (diagnostic techniques).[2] Furthermore, we need to focus on these sub-branches. Ayurveda tree will be fully grown in the coming years only if the processes are started from its nourishment to cultivation of well-differentiated branches and sub-branches, so that the tree provides ripe fruits for the society. The Government of India under various schemes is focusing on the nourishment of the tree; so, let us join our hands together to grow and flourish Ayurveda in a specialized manner in terms of specialties and super specialties to cater to the need of ailing society to make the people healthy and happy.

Looking at the present issue of AYU, it comprises totally 29 articles from various faculties. In the guest editorial, Dr. Gopal Basisht addresses the issues raised in our previous editorial of April 2011 issue. These may be the solutions for the issues becoming obstacles in all round development of Ayurveda. In a new proposal, Dr. Skandhan offers the views about water purification in Ayurveda. In the next section of review articles, four articles are included covering the topics on Pranayama, review on two ancient texts – Basavarajeeyam and Haramekhala – followed by a discussion on Ritucharya to answer lifestyle disorders. The clinical research comprises 14 articles covering various specialties, viz. Amlapitta, Vamana, Shwasa, Prameha, gingivitis, myopia, etc. This is followed by an article on Pharmacognostical research and three others on drug standardization and one on physicochemical analysis. The next section comprises three articles on pharmacological studies followed by letters to editor on the topics “Ayurpathy” and “Mysore Tridosha Scale”. From this issue, we are providing a new platform for authors under the section “Personal Communication”. This section will cover appreciation or criticism they received directly from readers. Hope this issue will satisfy the need of research intellects.
