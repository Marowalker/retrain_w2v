Sir,

I appreciate the interest the reader[1] has shown in this paper. This is true that the number of volunteers is too small. In a busy city like Delhi it is very difficult to get healthy volunteers for vamana in a big number. Moreover, this number was decided at the time of project sanctioning. Of course this can be a lead for the future workers.

This is an in-house research of CCRAS being conducted at CRIA, New Delhi and, thus, the tests were conducted at CRIA Delhi lab only. The tests were conducted under the guidance of Prof. S.C. Mahapatra, Professor of Physiology, AIIMS. Pathological abnormalities were not seen as the procedure was carried out on healthy volunteers.

This was a time bound work with a limited budget. I think my successor brothers and sisters can take a lead and work in this direction that what actually happens in healthy individuals with these procedures. Perfection has no end.
