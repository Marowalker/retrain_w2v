The AYU Journal wishes all its readers, reviewers and subscribers a warm HAPPY NEW YEAR as this is the first issue released in the year 2011. AYU was handed over to Medknow publications for its online publication in July-2010. And within a span of six months, Medknow has published first two issues of year 2010 and the issue no.3 & 4 were pending. With the release of this third issue we assure our readers to publish the October-December 2010 issue of AYU by mid March’2011 as it is also in final publication status. And we assure that the issues of the year 2011 will be published regularly on prescribed time. The authors are requested to send the Hindi saramsha of the paper exclusively typed in the prescribed font. It will be appreciated if authors give top priority to re-submit the revised articles as soon as they receive the comments of the referees. As a part of online review process, after revision and before final publication, the proofs are being sent to authors with the remaining queries. The authors are urged to reply the queries in order to avoid delay in publication. These efforts will help us in avoiding the delay in publication. The access of AYU is increased and quality is also improved. In last six months AYU has attracted the medical community towards Ayurveda. We are sure that with the joint efforts of all of us, in coming days AYU will be an important journal in the field of life sciences.

As always, this issue is a treat to the Ayurvedic readers and scientists. It comprises total 23 articles; 15 based on clinical researches, 3 each on pharmacological and pharmaceutical studies; one each on pharmacognostical & conceptual review. Each article is having unique importance as it explores the ideas of authors. The articles will inspire the researchers to work upon the topic and reproduce the results. Also this is a handy tool to Ayurvedic clinical practitioners to reply queries raised by modern scientific community. We welcome the feedback of readers on the published articles so as to improve the quality of articles and researches in the welfare of Ayurveda.
