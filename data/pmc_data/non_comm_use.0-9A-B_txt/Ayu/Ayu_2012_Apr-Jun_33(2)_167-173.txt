He practically applied Vaidika culture for treatment. His treatise translated into nine foreign languages apart from various Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali, Malayalam, etc., Sushruta is the most celebrated physician and surgeon in India. Though he practiced during the 5th century BC, many of his contributions to medicine and surgery preceded similar discoveries in the western world. Sushruta devotes a complete volume of his experiences to ophthalmologic diseases. In the Uttara Tantram, Sushruta enumerates a sophisticated classification of eye diseases complete with signs, symptoms, prognosis, and medical/surgical interventions. In particular, Sushruta describes what may have been the first extracapsular cataract surgery using a sharply pointed instrument with a handle fashioned into a trough. His ability to manage many common eye conditions of the time with limited diagnostic aids is a testament to his virtuosity.
