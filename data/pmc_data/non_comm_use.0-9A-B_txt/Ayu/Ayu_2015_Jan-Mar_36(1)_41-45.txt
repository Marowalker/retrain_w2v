Low back pain is one of the common conditions of loco motor system disorder, affects people during their productive life. About 40% cases of low back pain are of radicular in origin and considered under the umbrella of sciatic syndrome. It is a pain dominant disease and reduces human activity considerably in terms of personal as well as social and professional life. The condition resembles disease Gridhrasi mentioned in Ayurveda under the umbrella of Vatavyadhi, and here piercing type of pain which restricts the movement of the affected leg, make his walking pattern-like bird vulture and put him in disgraceful condition.

Aim:
To assess the effect of Vatari Guggulu on the management of Gridhrasi.

Materials and Methods:
A total of 40 patients of Gridhrasi were registered and Vatari Guggulu 3 tablet (500 mg each) twice a day was administered before meal with lukewarm water for 30 days.

Results and Conclusions:
About 32.35% of the patient improved moderately while mild improvement was observed in 47.09% of the patients. The drug has shown better effect on patients of Vata Kaphaja type of Gridhrasi in comparison of Vataja type of Gridhrasi.

==== Body
Introduction
At present, the lifestyle is gradually shifting away from healthy living, and therefore people fall victim of various diseases. Sedentary lifestyle, stress, improper posture, continuous jerky movements, long traveling, etc., put maximum pressure on the spine and lower portion of the pelvis. About 80–90% of people get affected by low back pain and 5% of those become victims of sciatica.[1]

Sciatica is a crippling disease cause pain in hip and to the whole path of sciatic nerve; it referred down back of the leg and sometimes to the foot. Trauma on lumbosacral spine (Abhighata), postural defects (Vishamachesta), overloading (Bharavahana), abrupt unbalanced movements (Atichesta), continuous jerky movements, sedentary lifestyle as well as psychological factors (Chinta, Shoka, etc.,) are considered as causative factors of the disease.[2]

The disease affects daily, routine activity of victim's life as it restricts the leg movement. Shooting pain occurs from buttock and goes down up to a foot. Victim is having pricking pain (Toda), twitching or trembling sensation (Spandana) due to stretching of sciatic nerve and paresthesia (Supti). Diagnosis is based on history taking with straight leg raising (SLR) test (Sakthikshepa Nigraha). Almost all signs and symptoms of sciatica resemble with disease Gridhrasi described in Ayurveda. The disease name itself is suggestive of the typical gait of the patient, which resemble with bird vulture that is legs become tense and slightly curved. The disease is listed under the heading where disease develops due to vitiation of Vata only, i.e. Nanatmaja Vatavyadhi.[3] Still, while enumerating the diseases, the disease Gridhrasi has been mentioned of two types, (1) Vata dominant and (2) Vata-Kapha dominant. The common symptoms of Gridhrasi are–pain starts from Sphik (buttock) and then radiates to Kati, Prushta (back), Uru (thigh), Janu (knee), Jangha (calf), and Pada (foot) along with Stambha (stiffness), Toda (pricking pain), Spandana (twitching)[4] and causes the Sakthiutkshepa Nigraha[5] (restricted movement of lifting of the leg). Whereas in Vata Kaphaja type of Gridhrasi, Arochaka (aversion to food), Tandra (feeling of drowsiness), and Gaurava (feeling of heaviness) are found additionally.

As far as treatment of the disease sciatica is concerned, use of analgesics and physiotherapy will help to certain extent but are not the ultimate cure.[6] Surgeries are moreover expensive, and again there are chances of recurrence as well.[7] Ayurveda offers ample of better options in the management of this painful disorder. In this disease, mainly Apana and Vyana Vayu vitiation are observed, but most of the times Kapha remains as associated Dosha. So for, treatment of Gridhrasi, drug of choice should have Vatashamaka, Kaphashamaka, Vatanulomaka, Dipana-Pachana (digestive-carminative), and Shulaprashamana properties.

Vatari Guggulu is mentioned in Bhaishajya Ratnavali Amavatachikitsa Prakarana wherein disease Gridhrasi has also been listed as one of the indications of this formulation[8] and having all above properties along with Rasayana properties. These properties may easily reverse the pathogenesis of Gridhrasi. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of Vatari Guggulu in the management of Gridhrasi was planned in the present study.

Materials and Methods
Patients of both sex, and age between 20 and 60 years, having signs and symptoms of disease Gridhrasi, and fulfilling inclusion criteria were selected and registered for the study. The study was conducted at IPGT and RA Hospital, Jamnagar, after getting ethical clearance from Institutional Ethics Committee (PGT/7-A/Ethics/2011–12/2087 Dt. 05.09.201), and also the trial registered in Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) wide No - CTRI/2012/11/003142 on 23/11/2012. Everything regarding the treatment was explained to the patients, and written consent was obtained prior to starting the treatment.

Routine hematological examination such as hemoglobin, total leukocyte count, differential leukocyte count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate; biochemical examinations such as blood sugar (fasting), serum cholesterol, calcium, protein, and alkaline phosphate

Urine for routine and microscopic examination to rule out any other pathological conditions.




Posology
Three tablets (each 500 mg) of Vatari Guggulu[9] was administered orally, twice a day, before meal with lukewarm water for 30 days. Follow-up was taken after 1 month. The test drug is procured from Pharmacy, Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar.

Criteria for assessment
The patients were examined for their subjective, as well as objective improvement, before and after treatment. The improvement was assessed mainly on the basis of relief in the cardinal and associated symptoms of the disease. Special scoring pattern was prepared to assess subjective symptoms. Goniometer instrument was used to access the degree of improvement in the movement, before starting and at the end of therapy.

Discussion
Ingredients of Vatari Guggulu are collectively having Vatashamaka, Kaphashamaka, Aamapachana, Dipana, Vedana Sthapana and Rasayana properties. Due to Ushana Virya and Vatanulomana properties, it normalizes the movement of Apana Vaayu and Vyana Vaayu which in turn helps to relieve pain. Furthermore, the Kaphashamaka properties of Eranda and Guggulu by its Laghu (lightness), Ushna (hot), Sukshma, Strotoshudhikara properties; it checks blockage of path occurred due to Kapha and so helps to relieve Stambha and Shotha (edema). Again by Aamapachana and Dipana properties, it corrects Agni and relieves generalized symptoms such as Aruchi, Tandra, and Gaurava too. Generally, the ingredients are more useful in Upastambhita Vayu, and this can be the reason that the patients of Vatakapaja type of Gridhrasi have shown better symptomatic improvement than Vataja type of Gridhrasi patients. Triphala and Guggulu are having Rasayana (rejuvinative) properties, but it needs long-term treatment to achieve it. The drug action may be enhanced by Yogavahi property of Gandhaka. Vatari Guggulu has anti-inflammatory and peripheral analgesic activity[10] which reduces the pressure on the sciatic nerve and improves the degree of movement, i.e. Sakthiutkshepa Nigraha. In this way, Vatari Guggulu works very well in Vata Kaphaja type of Gridhrasi than Vataja type and shows highly significant relief in symptoms such as Ruk, Toda, Spandana, Gaurava, Tandra, and Aruchi.

After treatment any remarkable or significant changes were not reported in radiological parameters. This is because of the changes in Gambhira Dhatu are permanent and need very long treatment for reversal.

Conclusion
The drug Vatari Guggulu can be effective in Gridhrasi, especially Vata Kaphaja type of Gridhrasi, as it ingredients are having Dipana, Pachana, Vatanulomana properties along with Vata Shamaka property. For only Vataja type of Gridhrasi, Rasayana drug having Snigdha, Madhura, and Vatashamaka property may be added.
