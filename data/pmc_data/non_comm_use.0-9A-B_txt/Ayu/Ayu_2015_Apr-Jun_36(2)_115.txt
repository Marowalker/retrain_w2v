A good writing skill is not God gifted; it is developed after a lot of sincere hard work along with thoughts in the right direction, at the right time. Moreover for Ayurvedic writing, it is again a very difficult task because a lot of matter is already described by our seers in a scientific manner, but now it should be again revalidated in terms of this era which should be understandable for the communities.

At present a lot of journals are available, many of them in e-version (online journals) for commercial benefit. They are not able to maintain their quality and come under the list of predatory journals. They produce the data which mislead the community as its validity is doubtful. Online journals though produce a quick data from the recent research quoted without citing the aboriginal facts in the printed version.

A decade before due to lack of scientific data genuinity, Ayurvedic texts could not be proved, though depicted by the Indian seers after diligent efforts. Later authentication to these texts required to check out them with latest scientific parameters. Hence our sincere effort must lie in the direction to upgrade the classical knowledge with our proven results abstracted from our current research. Emerging trends require validated investigations based on current scientific tools. However while fulfilling the need the main objective of Ayurveda should not deviate. As Ayurvedic literature is of Sanskrit origin terminology, in English is not adequate to define the terms like Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Like ‘Agni’ could not be elucidated using the term ‘Fire’ as its factual Ayurvedic sense is beyond the verbal meaning of English word ‘Fire’. Henceforth the recommendable practice is to use the Ayurvedic terminology as such rather than translating it into English. Regular use of Ayurvedic terminology will familiarize it among the community as of other regional languages are in general use too.

Paper writing practices vary from journal to journal due to their publicity and acceptability. Thus, we should follow the present trend to provide good scientific data which should be statistically acceptable to the modern community without any doubt. Replication of data is must for validation but variables and factors which are to be fixed are not common. Thus results are not found reproducible arising a question for the study conducted. It is a true fact for 50% cases of published work at present. Therefore get awakened friends, verify and validate the data in its true sense with different angels before publishing.
