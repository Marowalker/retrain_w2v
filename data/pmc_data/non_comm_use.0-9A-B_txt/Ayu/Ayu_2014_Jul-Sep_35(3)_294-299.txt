Cerebral palsy is a static encephalopathy that may be defined as a non-progressive disorder of posture and movement often associated with epilepsy and abnormalities in speech, vision and intellect resulting from a defect or lesion of the developing brain. There are 25 lakhs cerebral palsy affected children in India.

Aim:
To assess the efficacy of Rajayapana Basti (RB) and Baladi Yoga in motor disabilities of cerebral palsy in children.

Materials and Methods:
Total 98 children satisfying diagnostic criteria and between the age group of 2-10 years were included and randomly divided into two groups. In RB with Baladi group (n = 40) patients were treated with Mustadi Rajayapana Basti for 8 days, followed by oral administration of Baladi Yoga with honey and ghee for 60 days. Before administering Basti, patients were subjected to Sarvanga Abhyanga and Sastikashali Pinda Sveda. In the control group (n = 40), patients were given tablets of Godhuma Choorna for 60 days. Before administering the placebo tablet, the patients of the control group were given Sarvanga Abhyanga and Sastikashali Pinda Sveda for 8 days. The patients of the control group were given Basti with lukewarm water for 8 days.

Results:
RB group has shown improvements in understanding ability (13.43%), speech (10%) and performance skill (11.11%), in fine motor functions such as putting small object in to a container (14.3%), throws the ball in all direction (21.8%), use of thumb and index finger (10.93%), retaining 2 inch cube in fist (19.04%), folds paper and inserts into envelope (10.30%), in gross motor functions such as in crawling (26.7%), sitting (31.7%), standing (13.75%), walking (9.5%) and claps hands (13.9%) respectively.

Conclusion:
Mustadi RB along with Baladi Yoga provided a significant improvement in all the parameters and has promising result in managing motor disabilities of cerebral palsy in children.

Introduction
Cerebral palsy is the second commonest cause of disability in children next to poliomyelitis.[1] Cerebral palsy is a static encephalopathy that may be defined as a non-progressive disorder of posture and movement often associated with epilepsy and abnormalities in speech, vision and intellect resulting from a defect or lesion of the developing brain.[2] The prevalence of cerebral palsy among children is 2/1000 live births.[345] There are 25 lakhs cerebral palsy affected children in India.[6] The World Health Organization estimates that about 10% of the population have some form of disability.[7] Statistics from a different source indicates that 3.8% of the population has some form of disability in India.[8] Nearly 15-20% of total physical handicapped children suffer from cerebral palsy.[2]

Cerebral palsy n Ayurveda can be considered as Shiro-Marmabhigathaja Bala Vata Vyadhi, which may manifest itself in any of the following main clinical presentations such as spastic monoplegia (Ekanga Roga), hemiplegia (Pakshavadha), spastic diplegia (Pangu), spastic quadriplegia (Sarvanga Roga), choreoathetoid (Vepathu) and ataxia, which are described under Vata Vyadhi in the texts.[2] In Ayurvedic classics while describing Shiromarmabhighata, there is mentioning of diseases of Vata such as Chesta-nasha, Gadgada and Sadata including mental impairment.[9] Basti Karma is the best treatment in the management of Vata Vyadhi. Basti Chikitsa is also better treatment for disorders of Marmas-“Bastikarmam Samam Nasti Kinchit Karma Marmaparipalanam.”[10] Basti is advised for both children and aged persons, which is excellent both for the elimination of Doshas and nourishment of the body. This Basti therapy instantaneously promotes Bala (strength), Varna (complexion), Harsha (sense of exhilaration), Mardavatva (tenderness) and Snehana (unctuousness) of the body.[11] Hence, in the present study, Mustadi Rajayapana Basti (RB) followed by internal administration of Baladi Yoga was selected, which is having Vatahara and Sadyobalajanana properties. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of RB and Baladi Yoga in motor disabilities of cerebral palsy in children in comparison to control group.

Materials and Methods
Method of collection of data
Source of data
Patients were selected successively from the Out-patient and In-patient Department of Kaumarabhritya, SDM College of Ayurveda and Hospital, Hassan. Ethics clearance was obtained from Institutional Ethics Committee (dated 20-12-2005).

Inclusion criteria
The patients of cerebral palsy with mild to moderate physical disability within 2-10 years of age group were selected.

Exclusion criteria
Patients of cerebral palsy below 2 years and above 10 years with severe physical disability were excluded.

Research design
The study was an open labeled randomized, controlled clinical trial at inpatient level conducted in a tertiary Ayurveda Teaching Hospital located in district head quarter in Southern India. In the present clinical study, a total of 98 children with cerebral palsy were registered, out of which 46 patients were registered in treated (RB) group and 52 patients in the control group. 40 patients were completed the course in each group.

Treated (RB) group
Patients were given Mustadi Rajayapana Basti,[12] as per convention, before administration of Basti, the patients were subjected to Sarvanga Abhyanga with Tila (Sesamum indicum) Taila (oil) and Svedana (fomentation) with Shastika Shali Pinda Sveda (for about 45 min) as per classical method. Thereafter the Mustadi RB[13] (luke warm) was given in the morning on an empty stomach once a day for 8 days. The methods of administration and after care were adopted as per the textual guidelines. Quantity of Mustadi RB Dravya was fixed on the basis of age and was gently pushed into the rectum with a plastic syringe and catheter while patient is lying down in left lateral position with their right thigh pressed over abdomen. Then the patient was asked to lie on supine posture and gentle tapping was made over buttocks. The patient was advised to retain the material as long as possible and lie on the bed. Course of Basti treatment was followed by oral administration of Baladi Yoga in a dose of 1 g twice a day for 60 days with ghee and honey after food.

Control group
The patients were subjected to Sarvanga Abhyanga with Bala Taila and Svedana with Shastika Shali Pinda Sweda as per classical method for 8 days. This was followed by administration of placebo tablets of Godhuma Choorna (2 g, i.e. 4 tablets/day, each 500 mg) for next 60 days.

Method of preparation of Baladi Yoga
Ingredients of Baladi Yoga are depicted in Table 1. Raw drugs were obtained from genuine sources in the market and the medicine was prepared in Teaching Pharmacy of the institute. The drugs such as Bala (Sida cordifolia Linn.), Prasarani (Merremia tridentate (Linn.) Haller.f.), Eranda Mula (Ricinus communis Linn.), Ashvagandha (Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal), Lasuna (Allium sativum Linn.), Kharpara (calamine), Shuddha Mandura (dros iron/sludge iron) and Abhraka Bhasma (biotite) are powdered and later made three Bhavana (impregnation) each with Kumari (Aloe barbedensis Miller.) Swarasa (juice) and Mandukaparni (Centella asiatica Linn.) Swarasa. After the Bhavana is over, the material is dried and sieved and later collected and packed in 120 g per bottle.

Results
Effect of therapies on language and performance
The effect of therapy on the ability to understand was 13.43% and 1% respectively in RB group and control group respectively (P < 0.001). The effect of therapy on speech shows 10% and 2% improvement respectively in RB group and control group (P < 0.001). The performance skill was improved by 11.11% and 3% in RB group and control group respectively (P < 0.001).

Effect of therapies in fine motor function
The effect of therapy on fine motor function of the RB group shows improvement of 14.3%, 21.8%, 10.93%, 19.04%, 10.30% in characteristics such as putting small object in a container, throws the ball in all direction, uses thumb and index finger, retain 2 one inch cube in fist, folds paper inserts into envelope respectively (P < 0.001 except first character). The control therapy group, fine motor functions such as putting small objects in container, throws the ball in all direction, uses thumb and index finger, retain 2 one inch cube in the first fold paper and inserts in the envelope with have shown improvement of 2%, 6%, 0%, 4%, 0% respectively (P < 0.001).

Effect of therapies in gross motor function
RB group provided significance of P < 0.001 in all the characteristics of gross motor with improvement of 26.7%, 31.7%, 13.75%, 9.5% and 13.9% in crawling, sitting, standing, walking, and claps hands respectively. The effect of control therapy on gross motor with characteristics such as crawling, sitting, standing, walking, claps hands shows improvement of 5%, 4%, 0%, 1%, 4% receptively (P < 0.001).

Discussion
Effect of therapies
The language and performance of the patients were assessed before and after treatment. The effect of therapy on the ability to understand was found comparatively higher in RB group (13.43%) than the control group (1%). The effect of therapy on speech was found comparatively higher in RB group (10%) than the control group (2%). The effect of therapy on performance skill was better in RB group (11.11%) than the control group (3%).

Overall assessment of motor activity and co-ordination skills was assessed by way of the performance skill test conducted. RB group showed better result due to the improved inherent action of alleviation of Vata by Basti. All the above results are statistically significant (P < 0.001). Thus, it can be inferred beyond doubt that Mustadi RB and Baladi Yoga provided better improvement on the language learning and performance skills of children suffering with cerebral palsy.

The fine motor functions were assessed under different characteristics and have showed comparatively better improvement in Basti group. The Mustadi RB and Baladi Yoga therapy provided highly significant (P < 0.001) improvement in ability of putting small objects in a container by 14.3%, in throwing ball in all directions by 21.8%, in use of thumb and index finger by 10.99%, in retaining 2 one inches cubes by 19.04% and in folding paper and inserting it into envelope by 10.3%. Although the control therapy provided improvement in throwing the ball in different directions by 6%, in retaining the one inch cubes by 4% and in putting the small objects in a container by 2%. The control therapy showed no effect on using the thumb and index finger and folding the paper and then inserting it in an envelope. All these effects were also statistically insignificant. It is obvious from the foregoing discussions that Mustadi RB and Baladi Yoga provided better improvement in fine motor functions than the control group.

On the parameters of gross motor functions, Mustadi RB and Baladi Yoga therapy provided 30.85% improvement in sitting, 26.7% improvement in crawling, 13.9% improvement in hand clapping, 13.75% improvement in standing and 9.5% improvement in walking (P < 0.001). On the other hand, the control group provided 5% improvement in crawling, 4% in ability of sitting and clapping hands and 1% in ability to walk. However, it provided no improvement in ability to stand. However, all these effects of control therapy were statistically insignificant.

It is evident from the above description that Mustadi RB and Baladi Yoga provided better improvement in gross motor functions, fine motor function and language and performance skill in comparison to the control group.

Mode of action of therapies
Cerebral palsy is Vata Vyadhi, characterized by Dhatu Kshaya Lakshanas with manifestation of vitiated Vata and its disorders. Therefore, the therapies having Brumhana and Balya properties were selected for this study, which include Mustadi RB and oral administration of Baladi Yoga. Further as Poorvakarma of Basti, Abyanga with Moorchita Tila Taila and Shashstikashali Pinda Svedana were also carried out. In this way the beneficial effects shown by the therapy are all due to the specific treatment modalities selected for the study.

Action of Abhyanga and Shashtikashali Pinda Sveda
Skin is considered as the main abode of Vata along with Pakvashaya.[15] As Abhyanga and Shashtikashali Pinda Sveda involve cutaneous manipulation, it is considered as one of the prime procedures for mitigating Vata.[1617] These modalities of external therapy may act by dermal mechanisms of drug absorption and action. Primarily it acts by two mechanisms viz., local and central. The local mechanisms include cutaneous stimulation causing the arterioles to dilate and thereby achieving more circulation. It also assists venous and lymphatic drains. This state of hyper circulation also enhances the transdermal drug absorption and assimilation. Massage causes movement of the muscles thereby accelerating the blood supply, which in turn helps in relieving the muscular fatigue and reduces stiffness. Skin is an organ with rich sensory nerve endings, which on stimulation gives abundant sensory inputs to the cortical and other centers in CNS. This fact was exploited since thousands of years for stimulation of higher centers of central nervous system, which is evident when it is referred that Snehana and Svedana are the prime mode of treatment in treating neurological conditions.[15]

Effect of Mustadi RB
Basti is considered to be the best treatment to normalize the Vata Dosha[18] which is mainly involved in this condition. Moreover, the Yapana Basti are having Rasayana effect and can be administered for longer duration without any adverse effects. With the advancement of modern science, a new nervous system of abdomen has been discovered, which is named as enteric nervous system (ENS) and is called as the mini brain.[19] Though nothing about the relation between ENS and Basti therapy is known until date, the same is supposed to work in diseases of central nervous system like cerebral palsy. The ingredient drugs of Mustadi RB have predominant Vatahara and Rasayana properties. Hence Mustadi RB being a type of Niruha Basti, does the Shodhana as well as it gives strength to the patient. Govindadasa affirms the role of Rasayana in the Mastishkakshaya.[20] According to his opinion, Rasayana is the last resort for the patients of Mastishka Vridhhi and Rasapradoshaja.[21] RB performs all these functions by alleviating Vata. Charaka observes “Sadyo-Balajanana” (improves the strength quickly) as the unique quality of Rajayapana.[21] Bala is a multifaceted phenomenon that depends upon Udana Vayu,[23] Agni,[24] and Kapha.[25] As the Vata is Shighrakari (quick in action) and formation of fresh Rasadhatu takes place daily, the “Sadyo-Balajanana” effect of Rajayapana is attributed to improved functions of Udana Vayu and enrichment in the qualities of Rasadhatu.

Effect of Baladi Yoga
Baladi Yoga is formulated by including certain Vatahara drugs along with consideration of properties such as Rasayana, Medhya, Brumhana, which are necessary to improve the ability in children of cerebral palsy. Bala and Ashvagandha along with its Vatahara property have Brumhana, Balya and Dhathuvardhaka property. Ashvangandha is also having anticonvulsant, antistress and CNS depressant action might have helped in reducing the muscular spasm and abnormal movement.[26] Prasarini and Erandamula are Vatanulomaka and in addition possess Vrishya and Balya properties. Lashuna in addition to its Vatahara action has Deepana property, which may help in enhancing the digestion and assimilation in the gut. Because of Ushna and Teekshna properties it also helps in stimulating the sensory and motor functions by relieving muscular spasticity. Jadatwa seen in cerebral palsy can be reduced by its Rajasika guna. Abhraka is having Deepana, Pachana, Balya, Rasayana, Dhatuvivardhana, Shareeradhardyakara, Prajnabodhi, Varnya, Netrya, Medya, Stairya and Smrithikara actions, helps in the improvement of sensory and motor functions which are impaired in the cerebral palsy. Kharpara contains zinc which helps for regeneration of nervous cell and Shuddha Mandura helps in correction of Pandu and also helps in health promotion.[27] Because of Rasayana, Balya and Brumhana properties, Bhavana with Kumari Swarasa has been given in most of the Rasa Yogas mentioned for Vata Vyadhi. Mandukaparni Kwatha is also used in Bhavana for imbibing its Medhya property which helps in neuronal regeneration and helps improvement in mental faculties.[28] The drugs like Bala, Eranda Mula, Ashvagandha, Kumari and Mandukaparni which are made use in Baladi Yoga are having imunomodulatory action, which improves the immunity.[293031323334]

Due to all the properties mentioned above of the various ingredients of the therapy, along with Mustadi RB it has provided significant improvement in the daily activities, gross and fine motor functions, language and performance skill. Thus, the results of this clinical study are very encouraging and glimpse a ray of hope for the crippled children to get a remedy for their improvement through Ayurveda.

Conclusion
Rajayapana Basti along with oral administration of Baladi Yoga has definitely improved in gross motor functions, fine motor function and language and performance skill. Thus children can be helped by this treatment protocol to develop self-sustainability. However, it appears that, if training and physiotherapy is coupled with the present therapy, it might give better improvement since stimulation always leads to improvement.
