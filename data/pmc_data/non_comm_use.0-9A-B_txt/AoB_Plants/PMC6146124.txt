There was an error in the abstract, where ‘but females show greater’ should read ‘but females show decreased’. The correct sentence is:

In some cycads, (i) males and females have similar investments in leaf nitrogen but females exhibit greater incorporation of nitrogen from nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, (ii) males display higher photosynthetic capacity but females show decreased water-use efficiency, and (iii) males have higher stomatal conductance but similar stomatal density to females.

There was also an error in the last sentence of the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, where ‘greater’ should read ‘decreased’. The correct sentence is:

Despite males generally having higher photosynthetic rates, in some species females showed decreased water-use efficiency (more negative δ13C).
