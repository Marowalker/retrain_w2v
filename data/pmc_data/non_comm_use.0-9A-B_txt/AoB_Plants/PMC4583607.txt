production worldwide. Study on improving plant P uptake is hence of global
importance. We have investigated the responses of root morphology and root-exuded
organic acids to low P availability in three important food crops (barley, canola and
potato) with divergent root traits using a hydroponic culture system. Results showed
that plants evolved divergent adaptations of root morphology and exudation as a
response to low P availability. These results could underpin future efforts to
improve P uptake of the three crops which are important for future sustainable crop
production.

Phosphorus (P) is an important element for crop productivity and is widely applied in
fertilizers. Most P fertilizers applied to land are sorbed onto soil particles, so
research on improving plant uptake of less easily available P is important. In the
current study, we investigated the responses in root morphology and root-exuded
organic acids (OAs) to low available P (1 μM P) and sufficient P (50 μM
P) in barley, canola and micropropagated seedlings of potato—three important
food crops with divergent root traits, using a hydroponic plant growth system. We
hypothesized that the dicots canola and tuber-producing potato and the monocot barley
would respond differently under various P availabilities. WinRHIZO and liquid
chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry results suggested that under low P
availability, canola developed longer roots and exhibited the fastest root exudation
rate for citric acid. Barley showed a reduction in root length and root surface area
and an increase in root-exuded malic acid under low-P conditions. Potato exuded
relatively small amounts of OAs under low P, while there was a marked increase in
root tips. Based on the results, we conclude that different crops show divergent
morphological and physiological responses to low P availability, having evolved
specific traits of root morphology and root exudation that enhance their P-uptake
capacity under low-P conditions. These results could underpin future efforts to
improve P uptake of the three crops that are of importance for future sustainable
crop production.

Introduction
Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the major limitations for crop productivity
globally. In modern agriculture, mineral P fertilizers are extensively used, and large
economic benefits have been generated. However, P fertilizers have also been added in
amounts that far exceed the amount of P removed at harvest: up to ∼90 % of
P applied as fertilizer may be strongly sorbed to the soil to become less available to
plants, or eroded and lost in run-off (Gerke
et al. 1994; Smith
and Schindler 2009; Andersson et
al. 2013). As a consequence, high P input has produced many
problems, such as eutrophication and hypoxia of waterways (Withers et al. 2001) as well as
eutrophication of oligotrophic natural terrestrial systems (Lambers et al. 2013). Hence, it is important
to understand P-acquisition mechanisms and genetically improve crop plants to be able to
acquire P more efficiently, which would enable reduced P-fertilizer application.

Higher plants have developed various responses to low P availability, including modified
gene expression, morphological responses especially in root architecture (e.g. reduced
primary root length, more lateral roots and root hairs) and physiological modification
of the rhizosphere by root exudation and pH changes, as well as metabolic responses
(Raghothama 1999; Lynch 2011). To improve P-acquisition efficiency,
understanding changes in root structure and activities under various P availabilities is
necessary. During the past decades, three main types of changes have been revealed: (i)
changes in root morphology, such as root length, root hairs, root distribution and root
diameter (Williamson et al.
2001; López-Bucio et
al. 2002; Lambers et
al. 2006; Desnos
2008); (ii) modification of root physiology, important for release of water and
protons into soil and exudation of nucleases, acid phosphatases and carboxylic acids to
change soil properties and mobilize organic and inorganic P sources (Read et al. 2003; Lambers et al. 2006, 2008; Prieto et al. 2012) and (iii) colonization by arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi, since P uptake by the mycorrhizal hyphae is the dominant pathway for
P acquisition when plant roots are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Smith et al. 2003). Finally,
these factors might not operate alone but interact with each other to improve P
uptake.

Although significant progress has been made in understanding plant processes associated
with soil P mobilization and acquisition, each plant species is different and likely
responds to P supply differently. Furthermore, there are a number of issues that are not
well understood, such as the complex coordination of root morphology, and physiological
and biochemical responses under variable P availability (Shen et al. 2011). Root exudation represents
a significant carbon cost to plants, and root exudates are influenced by plant age,
species and genotype, root structure and environmental factors including both biotic and
abiotic stressors (Badri and Vivanco 2009).
Phosphorus deficiency increases the release of organic acids (OAs) by roots of certain
plants (López-Bucio et al.
2000), which could play a key role in mobilizing P from mineral surfaces and
from oxides and hydroxides of Al and Fe, as well as Ca-phosphates (Neumann and Römheld 2001; Ryan et al. 2001; Neumann et al. 2014).

In this study, we aimed to investigate contrasting responses of root morphology and root
exudation with regards to acquiring P. Therefore, we selected three economically
important crops with different root systems as plant materials: barley, canola and
potato. Barley, a typical monocot, has a wide-ranging network of fibrous roots, whereas
the dicots (canola and potato) tend to have a long tap-root with thick lateral roots.
Barley and potato are capable of forming an arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis to acquire
soil P, while the non-mycorrhizal canola cannot do this (Brundrett 2009; Lambers
and Teste 2013). We compared the root structure and root-exuded OAs of these
three crop plants under different P supply using hydroponic culture. We hypothesized
that under low P, (1) canola has a more developed root system with longer roots, greater
root surface area and more lateral roots, or increased root exudates to compensate for
its lack of mycorrhizas; (2) barley and potato exude less OAs than canola and thus save
carbon for releasing other compounds to promote rhizosphere microbial activity and (3)
compared with canola and barley, potato releases the least OAs and stores most of its
belowground carbon resources in tubers as starch. The information generated in this
study will be of value for a more sustainable production of canola, barley and
potato.

Methods
Plant material and experimental design
Canola (Brassica napus cv. MARIE), barley (Hordeum
vulgare cv. HEDER) and micropropagated seedlings of potato
(Solanum tuberosum cv. PIMPERNEL) were selected for this study.
Hydroponic culture experiments were conducted in the greenhouse of the Norwegian
University of Life Sciences (NMBU). Germinated canola and barley seeds were first
grown in full-strength nutrient solution containing 1.5 mM KCl, 2 mM
Ca(NO3)2, 1.0 mM MgSO4, 1 μM
H3BO3, 1 μM MnSO4, 1 μM
ZnSO4, 0.5 μM CuSO4, 0.37 μM
Na2MoO4 and 50 μM Fe-EDTA. Phosphorus was added as
KH2PO4 in a concentration of 1 or 50 μM, designated
as low P availability (P1) and P sufficient (P50), respectively (concentrations used
by Cheng et al. 2014).
Five-day-old uniform seedlings without seed residues were then carefully transferred
to 1-L plastic pots (one plant per pot) filled with nutrient solution containing P1
or P50, with pH adjusted to 5.8 ± 0.2. Solutions were replaced every third
day; at the same time, pots were rearranged randomly. For potato, ∼10 cm
heights of tissue culture-derived seedlings were selected for hydroponic culture, and
no root tuber was produced in this 4-week experiment. Plants were grown at 25
°C/16 °C day/night temperature with a 16-h photoperiod at a light
intensity of 200 ± 20 μmol m−2 s−1
and 50–75 % relative humidity. Three independent replications were
carried out.

Root exudate collection
Root exudates were collected as described by Khorassani et al. (2011). Briefly, after plants had been
grown hydroponically under P1 or P50 for 2 and 4 weeks, whole root systems of intact
plants were carefully washed with deionized water to remove the nutrient solution.
Then the whole root system was placed into ultrapure Milli-Q water (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA) in a container to collect root exudates; the volume varied from
20 to 50 mL depending on the size of the root system. The roots were kept in the
water for 2 h (between 10:00 and 13:00) under the same controlled-climate conditions
as described for plant growth. Neumann and
Römheld (2001) reported that roots are not harmed by Milli-Q water
and no significant degradation of the exudates occurs in a short time period of 2 h.
As Valentinuzzi et al.
(2015) reported, water is the most effective and suitable trap solution to
collect exudates like OAs, especially in a short time period such as 2 h. Micropur
(0.01 g L−1, Katadyn Products, Kemptthal, Switzerland) was then
added to the solution to inhibit the activity of microorganisms (Cheng et al. 2014). The
collected root exudates were immediately frozen at −20 °C. Before
analysis with liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS), collected root exudate samples were filtered with Phenex
regenerated cellulose syringe filters (pore size: 0.45 µm, filter diameter: 15
mm) (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA), and 0.2 µg deuterium-labelled succinic
acid was added to each sample to be used as an internal standard (IS).

Determination of OAs released from roots
The OA analysis was performed using a Waters Alliance 2695 LC system coupled to a
Quattro Ultima Pt triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK),
equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The auto-sampler in the
LC system cooled the samples to 5 °C. The injection volume was 50 µL
and sample constituents were separated using an Acquity XSelect HSS T3 (50 × 3
mm, 2.5 µm) analytical column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) at a column oven
temperature of 40 °C and a sample run time of 6 min. The trifunctional alkyl
C18-bonded phase used for the HSS T3 sorbent is compatible with the 100 %
aqueous mobile phase; so, aqueous formic acid (0.08 M, pH 2.4) was used as the sole
mobile phase solution at a flow rate of 0.3 mL min−1. Electrospray
ionization conditions were as follows: capillary voltage of 3.0 kV, source
temperature of 120 °C, desolvation temperature of 350 °C, cone gas flow
of 80 L h−1 and desolvation gas flow of 620 L
h−1. The cone voltage, collision energy and selection of product
ions were optimized for each OA for maximum intensities. Two characteristic
fragmentations of the OA precursor ion ([M−H]−) were
monitored. The most abundant product ion was used for quantification, and the second
product ion was used for verification of the OA (Table 1). The optimal quantifier ions in our MS system were
identical to the quantifier ions used by Erro
et al. (2009). For malonic acid, which has a small
molecular mass, only one product ion was used. Pure OA standards (citric acid
(>99 %), l-(−) malic acid (>99.5 %),
succinic acid (>99.5 %), malonic acid (99 %),
l-(+)-tartaric acid (>99.5 %) and deuterium-labelled
succinic acid-2,2,3,3-d4 (98 %)) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St Louis, MO, USA). The OAs were mixed in Milli-Q water in the range 0.05–2.0
µg mL−1, containing a fixed amount (µg
mL−1) of the IS deuteriated succinic acid. Internal standard
calibration was performed using weighted (1/x) quadratic regression
analysis of the peak area ratios (analyte/IS) versus the concentration ratios. Limits
of quantification were 0.015–0.04 μg mL−1,
corresponding to signal-to-noise ratios of 15. Table 1. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) conditions for the LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis

Plant harvest and measurements of root morphology
Plants were harvested 28 days after transfer to hydroponics, and roots and shoots
were sampled separately for subsequent analysis. The total number of green leaves and
senesced leaves was recorded. Root length and root surface area were measured using
WinRHIZO (EPSON 1680, WinRHIZO Pro2003b, Regent Instruments Inc., Quebec, Canada).
Shoot and root dry weight (DW) were measured separately after being oven-dried for 48
h at 65 °C.

Determination of P
Total P concentrations in dry root and shoot tissues were determined by inductively
coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (AtomComp 1100, Thermo Jarrell-Ash, MA,
USA) according to Ogner et al.
(1999) after digestion in a mixture of 65 % (v/v) HNO3/72
% (v/v) HClO4 (5 : 1, v/v) at 220 °C in a microwave
oven.

Statistical analyses
Data were statistically analysed by R software (version 3.1.3; software and
commanders were downloaded from the NMBU library). Two-way ANOVAs were used to study
main effects of P level, species and their interaction on all the parameters involved
in this study. For multiple comparisons to determine which of the six P/species
combinations were significantly different from each other, post hoc
pair-wise Tukey honest significant difference tests were used after ANOVA. For all
analyses, the significance α level of 0.05 was used.

Results
Plant growth at different P availability
After 4 weeks of P1 treatment, a 65 % lower total dry biomass was found in
barley and >87 % lower biomass in canola and potato, compared with
plants grown under P50; no significant differences were found between these three
crops at a low P level, while canola and potato showed 102 and 68 % more
biomass than barley at P50, respectively (Fig. 1A; Table 2). The root : shoot DW ratio increased considerably in plants grown under
P1, with >70 % increase in barley, and >300 and 400 %
increase in canola and potato, respectively; at P50, barley showed a significantly
greater (∼100 %) root/shoot ratio than canola and potato
(Fig. 1B; Table 2). Consistent with the results for
biomass, the number of total leaves was decreased by ∼42–53 % at
P1 compared with that at P50 for all three crops; potato (with an average of 38
leaves at P50 and 18 leaves at P1) had more leaves than canola (12 leaves at P50 and
7 leaves at P1) and barley (13 leaves at P50 and 7 leaves at P1) under both P50 and
P1 conditions (Fig. 1C;
Table 2). Low P availability
also led to earlier leaf senescence in all three species, especially in potato
(>53 % senescent leaves), with many shed leaves after 3 weeks, while
there was almost no leaf senescence in potato at P50 (Fig. 1D; Table 2). Table 2. F and P values of a two-way ANOVA on the

Root morphology
Changes in root morphology varied significantly among the studied crop species
(Figs 2 and 3; Table 2). Under P1, compared with P50, barley showed a marked reduction in total
root length (44 %) and root surface area (58 %), whereas canola showed
a significant increase in total root length (37 %), but a decrease in number
of root tips (45 %). Total root length in potato and root surface area in
canola did not change significantly. For potato, the number of root tips almost
doubled under P deficiency. At P1, canola and potato showed 58 and 49 %
greater total root length than barley, respectively; canola had 18 % greater
root surface area than potato, and potato had 57 % greater root surface area
than barley, but the average number of root tips decreased in the order potato (1892)
> barley (883) > canola (627). On the other hand, barley showed 36 and
55 % greater root length than potato and canola, respectively, and ∼55
% greater root surface area than canola and potato at P50. These three crops
had almost the same number of root tips at P50. Figure 2. Root structure of H. vulgare, B. napus and

and one representative photo of each crop was selected.

differences (P < 0.05) as shown by Tukey tests.



Root exudate analysis
Three OAs—citric, malic and succinic acids—were detected in the root
exudates of both P1 and P50 plants (Fig. 4; Table 2). All
these three OAs were found in canola and barley exudates, while citric acid was not
detected in potato root exudates (Fig. 4A and D). Under P1 treatment, the greatest amounts of total OAs (citric
+ malic + succinic acids) were found in canola root exudates (54 nmol
plant−1 h−1), while potato plants released the
lowest amount of OAs (11 nmol plant−1 h−1). When
root exudates were collected on the 15th day (just after solutions were replaced),
P-deficient canola plants exuded over 400 % more citric acid and 1300 %
more malic acid than the plants with sufficient P supply (Fig. 4A and B). However, succinic acid exudation
at P1 in canola was only ∼25 % of that at P50 (Fig. 4C). The exudation of all three OAs increased
in the P1 treatment of barley, but for citric and succinic acids, this increase was
not significant (Fig. 4A–C).
Canola roots exuded over three times more citric acid than barley roots under P
deficiency (Fig. 4A). For potato,
the amounts of released malic and succinic acid were in general only 10–50
% of those for barley or canola (except for succinic acid at P1), and no
significant differences between P1 and P50 were found (Fig. 4B and C). When root exudates were collected
on the 28th day (just before harvesting), the three studied OAs released by roots in
all studied crops decreased dramatically, with ∼30–70 %
reduction compared with those collected on the 15th day (Fig. 4D–F), and canola exuded the greatest
amounts of citric acid, while barley exuded the greatest amounts of malic acid under
P1 conditions; at P50, barley released significantly more succinic acid than canola
and potato did (∼3.2 nmol plant−1 h−1 in
barley versus 0.6 nmol plant−1 h−1 in canola and
0.1 nmol plant−1 h−1 in potato). Figure 4. (A and D) Citric acid exudation, (B and E) malic acid exudation and

(A–C) and 28 days growth (D–F). Values are means ± SE
of n = 8–9. Different letters indicate
significant differences (P < 0.05) as shown by Tukey
tests. NA, not available.



Phosphorus status in shoots and roots
Unsurprisingly, the P concentrations and P contents in both shoot and root tissues
were significantly higher (between 3 and 81 times) for plants supplied with P50
compared with those of plants supplied with P1 (Fig. 5; Table 2). Under P50 supply, the P concentrations and P contents in shoots
decreased in the order barley > potato > canola (Fig. 5A and B), while in roots, the order was
potato > barley > canola (Fig. 5C and D). The shoot and root P concentrations varied from 4
to 8 mg g−1 DW, comparing well with a P concentration in
agricultural crops that generally varies from 1 to 5 mg P g−1 DW
(Anonymous 1999). This shows that 50
μM was a P concentration sufficient for plant growth. Under P1 conditions,
potato had the highest P concentrations and P contents in shoots, although no
statistically significant difference was found in shoot P content. Canola had shoot P
concentrations equal to those of barley, but it had a P content that was only 45
% as high due to having only 55 % as much shoot biomass
(Figs 1A and 5A and B). In root tissues, potato and canola
had almost the same P concentrations, which were 121 % higher
(P < 0.05, Student's t-test) than
in barley (Fig. 5C), and potato
roots showed the greatest P content (0.06 mg versus 0.03 mg P in barley and canola),
but these differences were not significant (Fig. 5D). Figure 5. (A) Phosphorus concentration in shoot tissue, (B) P content in shoot tissue,

Discussion
Phosphorus availability and uptake directly affect crop productivity. Understanding the
relationships between root architecture, exudates and P availability was thus the main
objective of this study. To understand the complex adaptive responses of root morphology
and root exudates to low P availability, we carried out hydroponic culture experiments
on canola, barley and potato, three crop species with different root systems. Although a
hydroponic culture system does not reflect natural growth conditions for plants compared
with a soil experiment, it is widely used (Gahoonia et al. 2000; Dechassa and Schenk 2004; Ligaba
et al. 2004; Wang
et al. 2013; Cheng
et al. 2014) and useful for studying root architecture,
including tiny root tips, and for collecting root exudates for biochemical analysis of
OAs. Furthermore, the effects of plant–plant interactions were minimized in our
system, since we grew a single plant per pot. Contrasting responses of root morphology
and root-exuded OAs to low P availability in these three important food crops were
revealed. These results could underpin future efforts to improve P uptake of the three
crops.

The role of root morphology in improving P uptake
Root architecture plays an important role in P uptake. Previous studies have shown
that at reduced P availability, most species allocate more biomass to roots and
allocate root biomass in shallow soil horizons, as well as increase root length and
develop more and longer root hairs and lateral roots; some even produce cluster
roots, thereby promoting P uptake (Nielsen
et al. 2001; Lambers et al. 2006, 2015; Brown et
al. 2013). In this study, our results showed a pronounced
increase in root/shoot biomass ratio for the three studied species (Fig. 1B) under low P supply, which corresponds
well with previous reports (Hermans et
al. 2006; Hammond and
White 2008). However, we found some differences in root traits like root
length, lateral root numbers and root surface area among different crops
(Fig. 3): under low P
availability, barley showed a 44 % reduction in root length, 58 %
smaller root surface area and 21 % lower root tip number; canola showed a 37
% increase in root length and a 45 % reduction in root tips and potato
showed a doubling of the number of root tips, compared with under P50 conditions.
However, Steingrobe et al.
(2001) observed enhanced root-length production at a low P supply in barley
in a field experiment, which differs from our results. This could be due to the two
different methodologies used (i.e. we used a hydroponic culture, whereas Steingrobe
et al. performed field experiments involving a more complicated
environment around the roots). Moreover, the effects of micropropagated plantlets on
root systems are not clear so far.

Phosphorus uptake by plants is dependent on the surface area and length of the root
system and on lateral roots to explore a large soil volume (Richardson et al. 2009; Balemi and Negisho 2012; Lambers et al. 2015). In
our study, as we used KH2PO4 as P source, root morphology plays
a dominant role in P acquisition. At P50, barley had greater shoot P concentrations
and P contents than canola and potato (Fig. 5A and B), probably due to its significantly longer total
root length and greater root surface area, enabling greater P uptake
(Fig. 3A and B), because these
three crops had the same root tip number (Fig. 3C). Another explanation is its smaller biomass and higher
root/shoot ratio (Fig. 1A and B),
resulting in higher shoot P concentrations compared with those of canola and potato.
On the other hand, potato showed a significantly greater root P concentration and P
content than barley and canola did at P50 (Fig. 5C and D), suggesting that potato roots may have a greater P
uptake capacity than barley and canola. Further studies are needed to reveal the
mechanisms for this. In addition, under low P supply, canola roots showed greater
root length and larger root surface area than barley and potato, while potato showed
a remarkable increase in root tips compared with that at P50, and hence had greater
root P concentrations and contents than canola and barley (Fig. 3). This also suggests that root tips had a
major effect on improving P uptake, as found by Fitter et al. (2002). However, no significant differences
were found in root P concentrations and P contents under P1, which could be due to
the very limited P supply. Our results for potato root architecture agree with those
of McArthur and Knowles
(1993a), who reported that root growth in potato is less
influenced by P deficiency than either leaf or stem growth. Furthermore, they found a
greater root colonization level of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for P-stressed potato
plants, and P uptake by roots was enhanced by different kinds of arbuscular
mycorrhizal fungi at all levels of P supply (McArthur and Knowles 1993b). Brundrett (2002) reviewed the major influence that root
morphology characteristics such as cortex cell properties and root features like root
length/biomass ratio, root branching and root hairs have on mycorrhiza formation.
Highly mycorrhiza-dependent plants tend to have coarser root systems and would not be
as responsive to changes in nutrient availability. Hence, these root traits of
potato, especially abundant root tips, might favour mycorrhizal colonization.

The possible role of root exudation in low-P responses
Root exudation of OAs is considered as an important mechanism to mobilize P sources
and alleviate P starvation, because OAs can replace organic and inorganic P that is
bound to soil particles (Lambers et
al. 2006). The fact that those plants that release more OAs
could take up more P from growth media and soil has also been confirmed using
genetically modified plants (Lü
et al. 2012; Wang
et al. 2013). However, root exudates are influenced by
many factors (Dechassa and Schenk 2004).
We used the most suitable and effective trap solution—water—to collect
the exudates (Valentinuzzi et
al. 2015), but we could not completely avoid some microbial
breakdown, so the root-exuded OAs were possibly somewhat underestimated in our data
(Kuijken et al.
2015).

Great differences in OA exudates were found among species in our system
(Fig. 4). For canola, the
absolute rate of citric acid exudation corresponded well with that reported by Hoffland et al. (1989).
Furthermore, an increase in citric and malic acids and a decrease in succinic acid
were found for canola under P starvation, which compares well with the results of
Hoffland et al.
(1989), except that malic acid was the dominant OA. On the other hand, no
OAs were induced by P deficiency from canola roots, as reported by Ligaba et al. (2004) using
the same system.

For barley, citric, acetic and fumaric acids were detected in root exudates of two
cultivars under P deficiency by Gahoonia
et al. (2000) using a hydroponic culture, but they only
showed a difference between two cultivars; no information about the difference
between P supply and P deficiency was given. Our results showed no significant
difference in citric acid exudation in barley between P-sufficient and P-deficient
plants, but there was an increase in malic acid exudation in the P deficiency
treatment (Fig. 4A, B and E), thus
showing that there are differences in the types and quantities of OAs that are
released from different crop species and varieties in response to P starvation.

For potato, few references about OA exudates can be found in the literature, but the
increase in succinic acid exudation in response to P deficiency was in accordance
with the results of Dechassa and Schenk
(2004), while the absolute value in our results was lower (∼0.002
versus 0.36 nmol (cm root)−1 h−1). The reason for
this difference is unclear.

The decrease in the OA amounts released by roots of P-stressed plants after 4 weeks
(Fig. 4D–F) suggests that
root exudation was influenced by plant age (Dechassa and Schenk 2004; Badri and
Vivanco 2009).

Citric acid has the strongest ability to release soil P (Ryan et al. 2001), malic acid is
∼10 times less effective than citric acid in mobilizing soil P and succinic
acid complexes metal cations only very weakly and, hence, has only a relatively weak
ability to release soil P (Nagarajah et
al. 1970; Jones and
Darrah 1995). Therefore, canola, with its relatively rapid exudation of
citric acid, is likely to have the greatest ability among the investigated crops to
mobilize insoluble soil P. These results provide good evidence to support our
Hypothesis (1), but the effect of root exudates on P uptake could not be assessed in
this study, because P was only added to the system as aqueous
KH2PO4. Further investigation is required to reveal the
effect of root exudates (OAs) on P mobilization and uptake from soil.

Conclusions
Using a hydroponic culture system and various analytical methods, we have tested our
hypotheses that canola, a dicot oilseed crop; potato, a tuber-producing dicot and
barley, a monocot, respond differently under various levels of P availability. Our
results revealed that the non-mycorrhizal species, canola, showed rapid rates of
carboxylic acid exudation, which, together with its greater root length and root surface
area, could allow canola to acquire poorly available P forms and explore a larger soil
volume. The monocot and mycorrhizal species barley showed a reduction in root length and
root surface area as well as low amounts of root exudates; in soil, this would result in
a low P-uptake capacity. Potato released only trace amounts of root exudates but
produced double the number of root tips under low-P conditions, which would benefit its
P uptake in soil. Hence, our study indicates that plants evolved divergent adaptations
of root morphology and exudation as a response to low P availability. The results and
information generated in this study are valuable for future effective utilization of P
and improving the productivity of the three important crops.
