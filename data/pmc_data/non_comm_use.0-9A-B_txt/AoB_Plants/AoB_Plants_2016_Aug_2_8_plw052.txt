original work is properly cited.Long-distance water transport in wood is well known to be affected by the ionic
concentration of xylem sap. Based on immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate that pectic
polysaccharides and glycoproteins are not associated with vessel-vessel pit
membranes. Therefore, we challenge the hypothesis that the ion-mediated enhancement
of hydraulic conductance is caused by a swelling or shrinking of pectins surrounding
pit membrane pores. Our findings reinforce the need for an alternative hypothesis
besides the pit membrane chemistry to understand this so-called “ionic
effect”.

Ion-mediated enhancement of the hydraulic conductivity of xylem tissue (i.e. the
ionic effect) has been reported for various angiosperm species. One explanation of
the ionic effect is that it is caused by the swelling and shrinking of intervessel
pit membranes due to the presence of pectins and/or other cell-wall matrix polymers
such as heteroxylans or arabinogalactan–proteins (AGPs) that may contain acidic
sugars. Here, we examined the ionic effect for six Acer species and
their pit membrane chemistry using immunocytochemistry, including antibodies against
glycoproteins. Moreover, anatomical features related to the bordered pit morphology
and vessel dimensions were investigated using light and electron microscopy. The
ionic effect varied from 18 % (± 9) to 32 %
(± 13). Epitopes of homogalacturonan (LM18) and xylan (LM11) were not
detected in intervessel pit membranes. Negative results were also obtained for
glycoproteins (extensin: LM1, JIM20; AGP glycan: LM2), although AGP (JIM13)-related
epitopes were detected in parenchyma cells. The mean vessel length was significantly
correlated with the magnitude of the ionic effect, unlike other pit or vessel-related
characteristics. Our results suggest that intervessel pit membranes of
Acer are unlikely to contain pectic or other acidic
polysaccharides. Therefore, alternative explanations should be tested to clarify the
ionic effect.

Introduction
According to the cohesion–tension theory, long-distance water transport in plants
occurs through the xylem tissue in a passive way (Askenasy 1895; Dixon and Joly
1895; Jansen & Schenk 2015).
The driving force for water uptake is set by the transpiration rate in leaves and is
under stomatal control (Damour et
al. 2010). In angiosperm xylem, individual vessel elements
dissolve their primary and secondary cell wall partially to form perforated,
multicellular vessels that are specialised for water transport. However, these stacks of
vessel elements are of finite length, which means that no individual vessel provides a
direct connection from the roots to the canopy of a tree. Instead, water is transported
through an interconnected network of vessels, which is enabled by thousands of bordered
pits between neighbouring vessel walls (Choat
et al. 2008).

The micromorphology of bordered pits between adjacent vessel walls and especially the
intervessel pit membrane is assumed to play a key role in drought-induced embolism
formation (Lens et al.
2011; Scholz et al.
2013a; Schenk et al.
2015) and regulating hydraulic resistance (Sperry et al. 2005; Wheeler et al. 2005; Choat et al. 2006). Several studies reported
that xylem hydraulic conductance may depend on the pH, the ionic strength, and ionic
identity of the perfused solvents (Zimmermann
1978; van Ieperen 2007; Nardini et al. 2012). Our
mechanistic understanding of this so-called ‘ionic effect’, however, remains
limited. Frequently cited explanations for the ionic effect include the hydrogel
hypothesis (Zwieniecki et al.
2001) and the electroviscocity hypothesis (van Doorn et al. 2011; Santiago et al. 2013), which both rely on
chemical and physical properties of intervessel pit membranes.

According to the hydrogel hypothesis, the resistance of the water molecules through the
porous network of pit membrane microfibrils is affected by a potential swelling or
shrinking of pectins, which are a highly heterogeneous class of acidic polysaccharides
(Bonner 1946; Caffall and Mohnen 2009; Kastner et al. 2012). The backbone of
pectins is a linear chain of (1-4)-linked α-d-galactosyluronic residues
(homogalacturonan, HG), which can be modified in various ways, most notably by
methylesterification to generate acidic residues. Unesterified galactosyluronic residues
of pectic HG can interact with cations in the xylem sap and have been suggested to
result in a swelling or shrinking of pectins (Kastner et al. 2012; Ngouémazong et al. 2012). Pectic HG with higher
degrees of methylesterification can also form gels at low pH in the presence of
saccharides such as sucrose through mechanisms involving hydrophobic interactions and
hydrogen bonds (Kastner et al.
2012). Other modifications of HG in addition to methyl-esterification, include
acetylation of individual monomers, or substitution by xylosyl residues. Introduction of
rhamnose to the galacturonic acid-rich backbone can lead to branching with neutral
residues (Caffall and Mohnen 2009). If
pectins were an integral component of the pit membrane, then its swelling could increase
hydraulic resistance by reducing the diameter of the nanoscale pores between the
cellulose microfibrils of the pit membrane (Zwieniecki et al. 2001).

Previous studies suggest that pectins disappear during the final stages of vessel
development by hydrolytic enzymes that remove the non-cellulosic components (O’Brien 1970; Kim and Daniel 2012; Kim and Daniel 2013; Herbette
et al. 2015). Although about 20 different antibodies have
already been applied on bordered pit membranes (Table 1), immunocytochemistry techniques are limited to few species only,
especially Populus and Vitis vinifera. Most studies
show that pectic polysaccharides are absent in the actual, fully developed pit membrane,
but present in the outermost rim of the pit membrane (i.e. the annulus) and in immature
pit membranes of developing vessel elements (Table 1; Wydra and Beri 2007;
Plavcová and Hacke 2011; Kim and Daniel 2013; Herbette et al. 2015). An exception to this
is the report of pectins based on JIM7 in juvenile shoots of Vitis
vinifera (Sun et al.
2011). Moreover, the ionic effect did not decrease in transgenic plants of
Nicotiana tabacum (PG7 and PG16) with reduced HG content in
comparison with wild-type plants with assumingly higher pectin levels (Nardini et al. 2007a). If
pectin is lacking in intervessel pit membranes, it is possible that other acidic
cell-wall matrix polysaccharides/proteoglycans, such as heteroxylans or AGPs, could show
a similar swelling and shrinking behaviour as pectins (Li and Pan 2010), although there is also little evidence for
their distribution in intervessel pit membranes (Table 1; van Doorn et
al. 2011). Xyloglucan (LM15) and mannan (LM21) epitopes were found
to be absent in mature bordered pit membranes of hybrid poplar and hybrid aspen (Kim and Daniel 2013; Herbette et al. 2015), while xyloglucan was
found in intervessel pit membranes of juvenile grapevine stems and European aspen (Sun et al. 2011; Kim and Daniel 2013). Table 1. Overview of antibodies tested on pits in angiosperm xylem tissue. PM =

This paper aims to further test the hydrogel hypothesis by investigating the ionic
effect and the chemical composition of pit membranes in six closely related
Acer species. Because most of the earlier evidence indicates that
HG-related pectic epitopes (JIM5, JIM7, LM7, LM 19 and LM20) and rhamnogalacturonan
(RG)-I-related pectic epitopes (LM5 and LM6) could not be detected in intervessel pit
membranes (Table 1), we limited our
selection of HG-related antibodies to LM18, which has not been applied to pit membranes
as far as we know, while LM11 was chosen as a heteroxylan antibody, and four antibodies
(LM1, LM2, JIM13 and JIM20) were selected to test for the presence of glycoproteins,
including extensin and AGP glycans. Glycoproteins have not been reported in the actual
membrane of bordered pits (Wydra and Beri
2007; Herbette et al.
2015), although proteins and AGPs occur in xylem sap and may accumulate in pit
membranes of vessel elements and tracheids (Iwai
et al. 2003; Buhtz
et al. 2004). Whether or not (glyco)proteins play a role
in the ionic effect is unknown (Neumann
et al. 2010).

In addition, we investigated anatomical features related to pit and vessel dimensions to
better understand structural characters associated with the ionic effect. Earlier work
suggests that the amount of intervessel pit membrane area per vessel is associated with
the magnitude of the ionic effect, both across taxonomically unrelated species and four
related species of Acer (Jansen
et al. 2011; Nardini et al. 2012). Therefore, we expect that two
scenarios could explain the magnitude of the ionic effect in six Acer
species: (1) the chemical identity and/or the anatomy of intervessel pit membranes, or
(2) none of these two, which means that alternative explanations would be required.

Methods
Plant material
We collected 1- to 3-year-old branches from five Acer species
(Acer campestre, A. monspessulanum, A.
palmatum, A. sieboldianum and A.
tataricum) from single trees at the botanic garden of Ulm University
during April and August 2012. Between April and August 2012, we also collected
branches from eight trees of A. pseudoplatanus at the same location.
Sample collection for all species took place between 8 and 9 am to avoid severe water
stress levels and high levels of native embolism. Although minor changes in the
effect of seasonality cannot be completely excluded, differences in the ionic effect
between April and September were found to be insignificant (Gascó et al. 2007). Moreover, pit
membrane chemistry has been reported to differ between the growing and the
non-growing season (Wheeler 1981; Pesacreta et al. 2005),
but is unknown to show considerable differences between spring and summer. All trees
sampled were older than ten years. Collected branches were cut in the field and
transported to the lab in a plastic bag with wet tissue within ten minutes. For all
experiments, branches were recut under water prior to measurements. For the
anatomical measurements and immunolocalisation, we focused on the last (i.e. current
year) growth ring.

Vessel length measurements
We used the silicone injection method to assess the vessel length distribution (Sperry et al. 2005; Scholz et al. 2013b).
Five branches per species were collected and trimmed to a length of 30 cm. The
branches had a minimum diameter of 8 mm. Stem segments were perfused at
0.175 MPa with commercial bottled water (Auvergne Regional Park, France) at
room temperature for 30 min, or until no air bubbles could be seen at the open
end. We used a two-component silicone system (Rhordosil ESA 7250 A and ESA 7250 B,
Bodo Müller GmbH). Both substances were mixed in an 11:1 ratio (A to B). The
colourless silicone was stained by adding 1 % (w/v) Uvitex (Ciba UK plc,
Bradford, UK) dissolved in chloroform. The silicon mixture was degassed for
20 min, or until no gas bubbles emerged. Silicon was injected in the stem
segment with a Modell 100 pressure chamber instrument (PMS, Oregon, USA). Small
amounts of the silicon mixture were poured in glass vials. The distal end of braches
were submerged in the silicon mixture and transferred to a pressure chamber, which
was then pressurized to 0.2 MPa for 2 h. The silicon was allowed to
polymerize for 2 h at room temperature and transverse sections were made with a
sliding microtome (GLS, Birmensdorf, Switzerland). Vessel length distribution was
assessed by investigating these sections, starting at the proximal end. The first
positive silicone observation in a vessel was considered to represent the maximum
vessel length. We used the maximum vessel length to calculate four additional
distances to estimate the vessel length distribution, with 6 mm as the minimal
distance (Sperry et al.
2005).

Hydraulic measurements of branch segments
Commercial bottled water (Auvergne Regional Park, France) was used as a reference
solution for our hydraulic measurements to avoid artefacts caused by low salt
concentration (Sperry et al.
2005; van Ieperen 2007).
According to data from the supplier, this reference solution included 0.504 mM
Na+, 0.286 mM Ca+2, 0.07 mM
Mg2+, 0.158 mM K+, 0.084 mM
SO42− and 1.58 mM
HCO3−, while the pH was 7. Samples were perfused with
this solution at 0.2 MPa for at least 30 min, or until no air bubbles
emerged from the open end. This flushing was required to refill embolised conduits.
As the magnitude of the ionic effect is influenced by the percentage of intact
conduits in stem samples (Gascó
et al. 2006), the stem-specific hydraulic conductivity
(Ks, kg s−1 m−1
MPa−1) was measured on stem segments that corresponded to 80
% of the average vessel length (ranging from 2.27 to 4.81 cm), which
means that most vessels were closed and had no open vessel ends in the sample. This
approach allowed us to make a direct comparison across the six Acer
species, because this method takes into account the distribution of the vessel length
classes (Gascó et al.
2006). We perfused the samples with a pressure of 0.007 MPa in a
Sperry apparatus (Sperry et
al. 1988). The flowrate of water was monitored each 5 s
with an Sartorius CPA 225D balance. If the flow rate showed less than 5 %
variation over 30 s, the flow was considered to be stable and the hydraulic
conductanctivity was measured over 1 min. In most cases, stable flow rates were
obtained after 15 min. We tested the ionic effect by comparing stem-specific
conductivity (KS) with the reference solution and a
high-salt solution, which consisted of commercial water with an additional
25 mM KCl, and calculated the ionic effect (%) as the increase in
conductivity. The xylem surface area was measured after the hydraulic measurements
were completed. Callipers were used to measure the xylem diameter, which allowed us
to calculate the xylem surface area. The pith area could be neglected because of its
small area in our stem segments.

Immunolocalisation of cell-wall components
Fluorescence microscopy was applied using a set of six rat monoclonal antibodies:
LM18 (pectic HG; Verhertbruggen et
al. 2009), LM11 (heteroxylan; McCartney et al. 2005), LM2 (AGP glycan;
Smallwood et al.
1996; Yates et al.
1996), JIM13 (AGP glycan; Knox
et al. 1991), JIM20 (extensin; Smallwood et al. 1994; Knox et al. 1995) and LM1
(extensin, Smallwood et al.
1995). As far as we know, this is the first study applying the antibodies
LM1, LM18, JIM20 and JIM13 to intervessel pit membranes. Possible masking effects
restricting access to cell-wall components (e.g. Marcus et al. 2008) were not considered
in this study.

Slivers of wood from the current growth ring were fixated overnight in a solution
with 4 % paraformaldehyde, 0.1 mM phosphate buffer and 1 %
sucrose at pH 7.3. Samples were embedded in LR-Gold resin following the instructions
of the manufacturer. We tested cell-wall epitope distribution by fluorescence
microscopy. Semi-thin sections (0.5 µm) were mounted on an object slide and
incubated for 30 min in 5 % (w/v) milk protein in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). A 5-fold dilution of the primary antibody in milk/PBS replaced the
blocking milk. After an hour, we washed the sample three times with PBS. The
secondary antibody goat anti-rat-IgG conjugate with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)
was diluted 100-fold and incubated in darkness for 1 h in milk/PBS. Unbound
antibody was removed by washing samples three times with PBS for 5 min. The
sections were heat-fixed to glass slides without a mounting medium. We included
controls to test non-specific binding of the secondary antibody. Additionally, we
tested the sample for auto-fluorescence, which was quenched by staining with
toluidine blue. Samples showing no auto-fluorescence were treated with calcofluor
white to enhance the contrast of cell walls.

Wood anatomy
Wood anatomical features related to the dimensions and quantity of pits and vessels
were measured following standard protocols (Scholz et al. 2013b;). Transverse sections with a
thickness of ca. 25 µm were prepared with a sliding microtome (GLS,
Birmensdorf, Switzerland). Staining of the sections was performed with a 1 %
(w/v) safranin solution in 50 % ethanol and a 1 % (w/v) alcian blue
solution in demineralised water. After staining, the samples were dehydrated in an
ethanol series (50 %, 70 % and 96 %), treated with Neo-clear
clearing agent (Merck Millipore, Germany), and embedded in Neo-mount (Merck
Millipore, Germany). The embedding medium was polymerized in an oven at 60 °C
overnight. Photographs of the latest growth rings were taken with a Leica DM RBE
microscope system (Leica Micosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).

Electron microscopy, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), was applied to investigate ultra-structural details of
pits and cell walls. Tangential sections of about 1 cm2 and a
maximum thickness of 3 mm were oven dried overnight and mounted on SEM stubs
using carbon cement. The stubs were sputtered with a thin layer of gold using a
Balzers Union sputter coater (Lichtenstein, Lichtenstein). SEM pictures were obtained
with a Zeiss DSM 942 SEM-system (Jena, Germany).

For TEM observations of the pit membrane thickness (TPM)
and vessel wall thickness (TVW), slivers from short
branch segments (5 mm) were transferred to Karnovskýs fixative at room
temperature. After washing with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, samples were postfixed in 1
% buffered osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 4 h at 5 °C. The
OsO4 was removed by washing with phosphate buffer and a graded ethanol
series (30 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 90 % and 96
% ethanol) was applied to dehydrate the samples. The ethanol was then
gradually replaced with Epon™ resin over several days. The samples were cut
with an ultramicrotome (Ultracut, Reichert-Jung, Austria) to obtain transverse,
semi-thin sections of 500 nm. Ultrathin sections were observed with a Jeol
JEM-1400 TEM (München, Germany).

Statistical analysis
Anatomical characters and hydraulic measurements (Ks and
ionic effect) were expressed by average values (± standard deviation)
based on at least five measurements per species. The correlation between a xylem
feature anatomical and the ionic effect was tested by calculating a Pearson
correlation coefficient with P = 0.05 as a
threshold value. The IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 (2011, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) was used for the analyses.

Results
Hydraulic measurements of branch segments
The stem specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks) using the
reference solution varied from 0.269 (± 0.018) kg s−1
m−1 MPa−1 (mean ± SD) in
A. monspessulanum to 0.367 (± 0.024) kg
s−1 m−1 MPa−1 in A.
sieboldianum. All species showed a significant increase in
KS when perfusing the samples with the 25 mM
KCl solution (see [Supporting Information —Table S1] and Fig. 1). The ionic effect measured was on
average 24.7 % (± 12.4) and ranged from 18.0 %
(± 9.7) in A. palmatum to 32.4 %
(± 13.1) in A. tataricum (Fig. 1). Figure 1. Relation between mean vessel length (LV) and mean relative increase in

Immunolocalisation of cell wall polysaccharides
Results from the immunolocalisation are summarized in Table 2. The controls included for non-specific binding of
the secondary antibody were negative for all species studied. No positive staining
could be detected for LM1 (extensin), LM2 (AGP glycan), JIM20 (extensin) and LM18
(HG; Fig. 2). From the six antibodies
tested, LM11 (xylan, Fig. 3) and JIM13
(AGP, Fig. 4) showed positive staining of
the xylem tissue. The antibody LM11 labelled each xylem cell wall, indicating the
ubiquitous but weak distribution of xylan in their secondary cell walls. Figure 2. Selection of lack of epitope detection for the antibodies LM2 (AGP glycan, A

The JIM13 (AGP glycan) epitope was present in ray and axial parenchyma cells, but
most pronounced in vessel-associated parenchyma cells of all six
Acer species. Its distribution was consistently observed near the
inner cell wall of vessel-associated parenchyma cells (Fig. 4). The staining intensity varied between the species
studied (Table 3). In A.
palmatum, the JIM13 epitope was clearly seen in parenchyma cells (Fig. 4A–C), while weaker signals were
detected in A. sieboldianum (Fig. 4D–F) and A. tataricum (Fig. 4G–I). Table 3. Wood anatomical features of six Acer species. All numbers

Anatomical observations
A survey of the anatomical characters of the xylem cells is provided in Table 3. The mean vessel diameter
(D) was consistent for most species and around 25 µm,
except for A. pseudoplatanus, which showed a more variable and wider
diameter of 42 (± 11) µm. The latter species also showed the
lowest vessel density (VD) with 82 (±13) vessels
per mm2, and the thickest intervessel walls
(TVW), which were 6.4 (± 1.1) µm.
Acer campestre, A. monspessulanum and A.
palmatum showed vessel density values (VD)
around 120 vessels per mm2, while A. sieboldianum and
A. tataricum had more than 180 vessels per mm2.

Differences in the solitary vessel index (VS) ranged from
0.82 for A. campestre, which means that 82 % of all vessels
counted were solitary, to 0.43 in A. pseudoplatanus. The
vessel-grouping index (VG) ranged between 1.27 in
A. tataricum and 1.84 in A. sieboldianum. The
average vessel length (LV) varied from
2.27 (± 0.13) cm in A. palmatum to
4.81(± 0.18) cm in A. tataricum, while
LV was around 3 cm for A.
monspessulanum, A. pseudoplatanus and
A. sieboldianum.

Little variation was found for the intervessel pit-field fraction
(FPF), with values ranging from 0.65
(± 0.01) to 0.71 (± 0.02) in A.
monspessulanum and A. tataricum, respectively. The
average surface area of a single intervessel pit membrane
(APit) was between 21.23 (± 3.4)
µm2 in A. tataricum and 34.18
(± 6.6) µm2 in A. pseudoplatanus. The
pit membrane thickness (TPM) varied considerably, with
relatively thin membranes of 146 (± 16) nm in A.
tataricum to 235 (± 25) nm in A.
pseudoplatanus. The pit aperture area (APit
AP) showed a constant intraspecific variation
(SD = ±0.3 µm), except for A.
pseudoplatanus, which also had the largest pit aperture area
(APit ap) of 2.95 (± 0.93)
µm2.

We found a strong correlation between the average ionic effect and the mean vessel
length LV (Pearson’s
r = 0.84,
n = 6,
P = 0.03). No other anatomical features
(D, DH,
VD, VG,
AP, APit,
APit ap,
FPF,TPM and
FP) correlated with the ionic effect values of the six
Acer species.

Discussion
Testing the hydrogel hypothesis
One of the key findings of this paper is that none of the epitopes for the six
antibodies tested could be detected in intervessel pit membranes of the six
Acer species studied. The lack of HG and RG-I-related epitopes in
intervessel pit membranes as based on LM18 and seven additional antibodies tested in
previous studies (Table 1; Plavcová and Hacke 2011; Kim and Daniel 2012, 2013; Herbette
et al. 2015; but see Sun et al. 2011) suggest that pectic
polysaccharides appear to be absent in intervessel pit membranes of fully developed
vessels, and that the hydrogel hypothesis does not fully explain the ionic effect.
Therefore, an alternative hypothesis is required, which supports our scenario 2 as
outlined in the Introduction, but rejects scenario 1 (Nardini et al. 2007b, 2011; van Doorn et al. 2011; Santiago et al. 2013).
New functional explanations for the ionic effect could for instance come from
surfactants and surfactant-coated nanobubbles in xylem sap, which may change in size
depending on the ionic concentration of xylem sap (Duval et al. 2012; Jansen and Schenk 2015; Schenk et al. 2015). A lack of pectins
and removal of the non-cellulosic, non-pectic components during vessel development
was also suggested based on traditional staining techniques (O’Brien and Thimann 1967; O’Brien 1970). However, the presence of pectins in
vessel-parenchyma pit membranes has been reported several times (Table 1; Plavcová and Hacke 2011; Kim and Daniel 2012; Kim and Daniel 2013; Herbette et al. 2015), indicating that
pit membrane chemistry also depends on the pit type. While the occurrence of pectins
in vessel–parenchyma pit membranes could be associated with gel and tylosis
formation (Rioux et al.
1998; De Micco et
al. 2016), these pectins are unknown to have any effects on the
ionic effect. We could not detect pectins in the half-bordered vessel-parenchyma pits
of Acer (via LM18).

The presence of cellulose in fully developed intervessel pit membranes was proven in
functional assays and based on histological observation with specific probes for
crystalline and non-crystalline cellulose (Dusotoit-Coucaud et al. 2014; Herbette et al. 2015). Few studies,
however, have suggested that methyl-esterified pectins remain present in mature
intervessel pit membranes of Acer pseudoplatanus, Dianthus
caryophyllus, Populus italica and Robinia
pseudo-acacia, while acidic pectins and vic-glycol side-groups are
removed from pit membranes during hydrolysis (Catesson et al. 1979; Catesson 1983). The presence of acidic pectins has been
reported in torus-bearing pit membranes of Ulmus (Czaninski 1979; Jansen et al. 2004). Based on the
ruthenium red staining and hydroxylamine-ferric chloride staining techniques, the
relative abundance of acidic versus methylesterified pectins was suggested to be
closely related to the ionic effect in four Lauraceae species (Gortan et al. 2011). Light microscopic
observation after staining with ruthenium red also suggested that pectins occur in
the intervessel pit membranes of Umbellularia californica (Nardini et al. 2011).
However, these more traditional staining techniques should be interpreted with
caution because the classical reaction of ruthenium red with pectins is typical but
not highly specific (Bonner 1946; Luft 1971).

Evidence for the lack of pectic polysaccharides in intervessel pit membranes based on
immunocytochemical techniques appears to be consistent (Table 1). Application of a commercial pectinase treatment
to intervessel pit membranes in Fagus sylvatica did not affect the
pit membrane ultrastructure in TEM, and was found to have no effect on embolism
resistance, unlike cellulase-treated material (Dusotoit-Coucaud et al. 2014). The observation that
hydrolysis of pectins induced a sharp increase in vulnerability to embolism, without
any significant effect on hydraulic conductance, could be caused by the occurrence of
pectins in the pit membrane annulus (Plavcová and Hacke 2011; Kim
and Daniel 2013). However, methylesterified HG and fucosylated xyloglucans
(XyGs) were detected in intervessel pit membranes of grapevine plants based on the
JIM7 and CCRC-M1 antibodies, respectively (Sun
et al. 2011). A potential explanation for this finding
of pectins in intervessel pit membranes could be that the observations by Sun et al. (2011) are
based on juvenile xylem of young branches (< 12 weeks old), which may
include a high amount (ca. 35 %) of living, not fully differentiated vessels
(Jacobsen et al.
2015). The observation of methylesterfied HG and XyGs in grapevine should,
therefore, be tested in mature xylem tissue.

Heteroylans (LM11) appear to be abundantly distributed in the secondary cell wall of
all xylem cells (Awano et al.
2002). The presence of the JIM13 AGP epitope characterises xylem parenchyma
cells, including both ray and axial parenchyma (Fig. 2), while LM2 targets a different AGP epitope that appears to be
absent. AGPs have also been reported in meta- and protoxylem vessels of
Echinacea purpurea using antibodies against (β-D-Glc)3 Yariv
phenylglycoside (Göllner et
al. 2013). AGPs perform various functions in plants: they are
involved in growth, programmed cell death, pattern formation, and interact with
growth regulators (Seifert and Roberts
2007). In some parenchyma cells, we detected AGPs in the plasma membrane
based on the JIM13 epitope. The appearance of AGPs in the plasma membrane is a
logical consequence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring in the plasma
membrane. Although more evidence is required, AGPs could be involved in the
monitoring of the hydraulic system, formation of tyloses, refilling of embolised
conduits or other hydraulic processes.

To what extent do anatomical features account for the ionic effect?
Surprisingly, we found a positive and significant correlation between the mean vessel
length and the ionic effect, but not with any other vessel and bordered pit
characteristics. This finding suggests that species with longer vessels such as
A. tataricum have a stronger ionic effect than species with a
shorter mean vessel length. For Populus tremula, Tilia
cordata and Acer platanoides, a negative correlation
between xylem conduit diameter and ionic effect has been reported (Aasamaa and Sõber 2010). Considering
that vessel diameter and length are positively related (Hacke et al. 2006), these findings appear
not to agree with our measurements. Hence, further research based on a larger number
of species and a wide range of vessel lengths would be required to test the
correlation reported here.

The lack of other anatomical correlations appears to contradict earlier work on four
Acer species (Nardini
et al. 2012), including three species that were also
investigated in this study (i.e. A. campestre, A.
monspessulanum and A. pseudoplatanus). A positive
correlation was found between the ionic effect and characters related to vessel
grouping and intervessel conectivity (Jansen
et al. 2011; Nardini et al. 2012). A correlation between the ionic
effect of four Acer species and the intervessel contact fraction
(FC) was only supported at the interspecific level and
not significant at the intraspecific level (Nardini et al. 2012). A potential explanation for this
discrepancy could be that the six Acer species studied here show a
relatively narrow range of variation in the ionic effect (from 18 % in
A. palmatum to 31 % in A. tataricum)
compared with the 2–32 % range across 20 species (Jansen et al. 2011). However, a similar
narrow range from 15 % to 23 % was also reported by Nardini et al. (2012).
Moreover, the ionic effect of the four Acer species measured by
Nardini et al.
(2012) were based on stem segments that were ca. 10 cm long, while
our measurements were based on a stem segment length with at least 80 % of all
vessels intact (i.e. closed). Therefore, direct comparison between this study and
Nardini et al. (2012) cannot be made.

Conclusions
This paper demonstrates the ionic effect for six, closely related species within the
genus Acer. Although this phenomenon has various implications in the
field of plant water relations, the actual relevance in planta and the
potential relationships between the ionic effect and plant traits have not been
elucidated. Our results confirm the absence of pectic polysaccharides in intervessel pit
membranes and the lack of a relation with several pit anatomical traits, which
reinforces the need for an alternative hypothesis besides the hydrogel hypothesis to
provide a full mechanistic explanation of the ionic effect.
