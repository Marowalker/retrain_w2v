This paper shows that Phragmites-dominated vegetation provides important non-habitat ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, water quality maintenance) in proportion to its biomass, and many habitat functions for other organisms that vary depending on characteristics of the vegetation and surrounding landscape.

Phragmites australis (common reed) is widespread in North America, with native and non-native haplotypes. Many ecologists and wetland managers have considered P. australis a weed with little value to the native biota or human society. I document important ecosystem services of Phragmites including support for many common and rare species of plants and animals. This paper is based on an extensive review of the ecology and natural history literature, discussions with field workers, and observations in 13 US states and one Canadian province during the past 40 years. Phragmites sequesters nutrients, heavy metals and carbon, builds and stabilizes soils, and creates self-maintaining vegetation in urban and industrial areas where many plants do not thrive. These non-habitat ecosystem services are proportional to biomass and productivity. Phragmites was widely used by Native Americans for many purposes; the most important current direct use is for the treatment of wastes. Most of the knowledge of non-habitat ecosystem services is based on studies of P. australis haplotype M (an Old World haplotype). Phragmites also has habitat functions for many organisms. These functions depend on the characteristics of the landscape, habitat, Phragmites stand, species using Phragmites and life history element. The functions that Phragmites provides for many species are optimal at lower levels of Phragmites biomass and extent of stands. Old World Phragmites, contrary to many published statements, as well as North American native Phragmites, provide valuable ecosystem services including products for human use and habitat functions for other organisms. Phragmites stands may need management (e.g. thinning, fragmentation, containment or removal) to create or maintain suitable habitat for desired species of animals and plants.

Introduction
Phragmites australis (common reed, hereinafter Phragmites) is widespread in North America (Clevering and Lissner 1999). Pre-Columbian Holocene fossils have been found in many localities (Rigg and Richardson 1938; additional citations in Kiviat and Hamilton 2001) and 40 000-year-old Phragmites was found in coprolites of the extinct Nothrotheriops shastensis (Shasta ground sloth) in an Arizona cave (Hansen 1978). Although Phragmites was evidently widespread in pre-Columbian North America, it is unclear how frequent or extensive it was in individual localities. Phragmites now occurs in patches in, or dominates the vegetation of, many fresh and brackish wetlands, littoral zones of lakes and ponds, disturbed wetlands, wet meadows, springs, seeps, ditches, swales and waste ground habitats such as wetland fill, mined areas and garbage landfill cover.

There are native and non-native haplotypes of P. australis in North America (Saltonstall 2002; Saltonstall et al. 2004). Excluding ‘Gulf Coast’ Phragmites, I refer to the native haplotypes as ‘native’ Phragmites, and the non-native haplotype M as ‘Old World’ Phragmites because it is widespread in Africa and Asia as well as Europe. (Native Phragmites was called Phragmites australis americanus, and Old World Phragmites was called P. a. australis by Saltonstall et al. 2004.) In North America, Old World Phragmites is most common in the northeastern states and progressively less common westward across the continent; native Phragmites is rare in the northeastern states, somewhat more common in the Middle Atlantic states, and most common in the western states (Saltonstall 2002). Gulf Coast Phragmites (P. a. berlandieri, sensu
Saltonstall et al. 2004) occurs in peninsular Florida and on the Gulf Coast; it is a hybrid of Old World P. australis and P. mauritianus (Lambertini et al. 2012a). On morphological grounds, Ward (2010) asserted that Gulf Coast Phragmites of peninsular Florida is actually the widespread tropical species Phragmites karka. Lambertini et al. (2012a) discerned long-distance dispersal and hybridization of Phragmites on the US Gulf Coast and questioned the application of traditional species concepts to Phragmites. Genetic diversity is also high within all three kinds of Phragmites, and there is hybridization among the three entities (Lambertini et al. 2012a, b; Meyerson et al. 2012).

Several morphological and physiological features distinguish Phragmites from other wetland graminoids. Phragmites is large; it produces extensive colonies by means of underground rhizomes and ground-surface stolons, and the aerial shoots (culms) are 1–4+ m tall. Peak aboveground biomass in well-developed stands of the non-native haplotype M in the northeastern states can be 730–3700 g dry weight (dw) m−2 and exceeds the aboveground biomass of co-occurring marsh plants (Meyerson et al. 2000). One estimate of underground biomass from a New Jersey freshwater tidal marsh was 7180 g dw m−2, 6.7 times the peak aboveground biomass (Walker and Good 1976), and another estimate of underground biomass from a brackish tidal marsh in New Jersey was 1368 g dw m−2 (Windham 2001). In 17 studies, the density of living culms was 13–125 m−2 (Meyerson et al. 2000). In a freshwater tidal marsh on the Hudson River, standing (dead) mass in approximately April was similar to standing (dead plus live) mass in late June (Krause et al. 1997). Culms and leaves are rich in structural materials, including silica which stiffens these plant parts and helps to protect them from consumers and mechanical damage. In a European freshwater tidal marsh, Phragmites played an important role in cycling silicon (Struyf et al. 2007).

Although many dead culms stand for 2 years, Phragmites leaf blades decompose more rapidly; nonetheless, Phragmites litter may sequester nutrients and make them unavailable to other organisms (Meyerson et al. 2000). Phragmites marshes are capable of removing large amounts of pollutional nitrogen from surface waters (e.g. in Spain, González-Alcaraz et al. 2012). In the Chesapeake Bay region, Mozdzer et al. (2010) found that both Phragmites and Spartina alterniflora assimilated amino acids directly, and that urea nitrogen assimilation was greater in both native and Old World Phragmites than in Spartina. They also found affinity for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in decreasing order in native Phragmites, Old World Phragmites and Spartina, and estimated that as much as 47 % of Phragmites nitrogen demand could be satisfied by DON. Phragmites is effective in taking up nitrogen from the soil, and due to the greater biomass of Phragmites relative to co-occurring plants, aboveground standing stocks of nitrogen may be 2–3 times higher in Phragmites stands (Meyerson et al. 2000). In keeping with its high productivity, Phragmites efficiently oxygenates the rhizosphere during the growing season (Armstrong and Armstrong 1990). Phragmites has a C3 mechanism of carbon fixation and mature leaves have a structure consonant with that mechanism; however, the anatomy of young leaves is more like that of a C4 species (Antonielli et al. 2002).

Invasibility due to human alteration of hydrology, water quality, soils and vegetation plays an important role in the spread of haplotype M in North America (Kettenring et al. 2012). Seed viability of Old World Phragmites was low but variable in the Chesapeake Bay region, and some seeds were dormant at maturity whereas others were not (Kettenring and Whigham 2009). Phragmites seeds may require special conditions for germination and establishment. For example, falling water levels and exposed sandy bottoms were favourable for the spread of Old World Phragmites in the Great Lakes (Tulbure and Johnston 2010). Habitats created by Castor canadensis (American beaver), especially exposed bottoms of abandoned beaver ponds, are also suitable for the establishment of Old World Phragmites (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).

Many ecologists and wetland managers in the USA and Canada have considered P. australis as a weed with little value to the native biota or human society (Meyerson et al. 2000, 2002; Kiviat 2010). Occasionally, ecologists have expressed the contrary view that reedbeds provide important habitat and other ecosystem services (e.g. Kane 2001b; Weis and Weis 2003). Here I show that Phragmites provides important ecosystem services, among which is support for common and rare elements of biodiversity including many species of native plants and animals. These habitat functions of Phragmites are linked to distinctive characteristics of the plant and are generally similar to habitat functions of Phragmites in the Old World. I also propose a new approach to managing Phragmites to optimize its habitat functions, potential harvest for products and other ecosystem services. It is important to present a detailed summary of habitat functions to create an accurate context for further research and management decisions.

Methods
This paper is based on an extensive review of the ecology and natural history literature, discussions with many biologists and naturalists, 40 years of qualitative field observations and a series of quantitative field studies. I have studied Phragmites in 13 US states (New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Connecticut and Massachusetts in the Northeast; Florida in the Southeast; New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Colorado and southern California in the Southwest; North Dakota in the north-central region) and one Canadian province (Manitoba), as well as three countries in Europe (Czech Republic, Italy, the UK) and one in Africa (Botswana). In this paper, all observations are from North America unless identified otherwise. I refer to Phragmites stands or patches as ‘reedbeds’. In comparing the biota of reedbeds to alternate habitats, I have used abundance (density) of individual species and species richness because those metrics are most commonly available in the literature.

Results and Discussion
The body of this paper addresses two categories of ecosystem service provided by Phragmites: non-habitat services, and habitat functions or biodiversity support.

Non-habitat ecosystem services
Non-habitat ecosystem services (i.e. services other than biodiversity support) provided by Phragmites are listed in Table 1. Generally these services are proportional to biomass production because they are a function of physiological processes such as photosynthesis, nutrient uptake and transpiration.
Table 1 Non-habitat ecosystem services provided by North American P. australis. The classification of services follows MEA (2005).

Most of the Phragmites services shown in Table 1 are clearly beneficial to human society. However, biomass production and soil building, for example, can have detrimental effects on the habitats of certain organisms (Kiviat 2009b; see below) and may cause infilling of certain non-tidal wetlands to the point of reduction in water storage capacity.

Soil building and carbon sequestration
Phragmites builds and stabilizes tidal marsh soils, and stores carbon in litter and soils more effectively than Spartina spp. (Windham and Lathrop 1999; Rooth and Stevenson 2000; K. V. R. Schäfer, Rutgers University, Newark, NJ, pers. comm.). Thus Phragmites may protect tidal marshes from erosion associated with sea-level rise, as well as helping to mitigate global climate change. Soil building by Phragmites in tidal marshes appears to reduce micro-relief of the marsh surface and eliminate small pools used as a refuge at low tide by Fundulus (killifish) and other small nekton (Dibble and Meyerson 2012).

Products
There is direct use of Phragmites for roof thatch and other products in North America (Table 1). Thatching is practised on a small scale in Nova Scotia, Maryland, and occasionally elsewhere; however, the expense and lack of a tradition may inhibit expansion of this use. Commercial and home use of dried Phragmites for decoration in and outside the house is common. Phragmites is rarely planted in gardens or for landscaping (but see Urgo 2003), although superficially similar giant grasses such as Cortaderia (pampas grass) and Miscanthus (Eulalia) are often planted for ornament. Other uses of harvested Phragmites material (Table 1) appear to be uncommon or local. Excepting waste treatment, the level of extant direct use in North America is evidently lower than historic and prehistoric use of Phragmites by Native Americans, especially in the western USA (and northwestern Mexico; Kiviat and Hamilton 2001), and historic and contemporary use in parts of Europe (Hawke and José 1996) and the Tigris–Euphrates delta marshes of Iraq (Thesiger 1964).

Waste treatment
Clearly, the most important direct use of Phragmites in North America is in constructed systems for dewatering sludge from sewage treatment plants (e.g. Burgoon et al. 1997), and less frequently for removing nutrients from partially treated sewage (e.g. Gersberg et al. 1986). There are probably thousands of sludge-drying beds of variable size in the USA, and these are cost-effective and conserve energy that would otherwise be used in heat-drying of sludge. The high rates of transpiration of Phragmites and its ability to tolerate salt, metals and other pollutants make Phragmites suitable for drying sludge, and the efficient uptake of nutrients makes it suitable for polishing partially treated wastewater. Phragmites has also been used experimentally to dewater dredged material (Stout 1977).

Phytoremediation
The ability of Phragmites to take up metals and other toxic substances from soil and water, and its efficient aeration of the rhizosphere, have applications in phytoremediation (Weis and Weis 2004; Ma, no date). In brackish tidal marshes, Old World Phragmites was found to take up heavy metals from surface water and sequester them in biomass which would eventually be incorporated into marsh soil (Windham et al. 2003). Under some conditions, metals are retained in plaques on root surfaces (Mal and Narine 2004). Translocation of heavy metals from water to soil may make metals easier to remove from estuarine systems. This benefit may be counterbalanced by some loss of mercury from leaves to air (Kozuchowski and Johnson 1978; Windham et al. 2001).

Energy
The rapid growth and regrowth after cutting, and high level of biomass production, of Phragmites suggest a good feedstock for bioenergy. Indeed, Phragmites seems to be as good as Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) in this respect, and does not require the energy and fertilizer inputs that switchgrass does (R. Vaičekonytė, E. Kiviat, F. Nsenga and A. Ostfeld, Hudsonia, Annandale, NY, unpubl. data). We are studying Phragmites fuel pellets developed by François Nsenga (TechnoPhrag, Montréal, Canada), and the potential to produce pellets from Phragmites combined with other cellulosic waste products. Additionally, Phragmites (perhaps combined with other organic wastes) should be a good feedstock for methane generation by anaerobic digestion. Granéli (1984) suggested the use of Phragmites in Sweden for fuel pellets or other solid biofuels.

Other non-habitat services
High evapotranspiration from reedbeds, and their apparently high albedo, should ameliorate microclimates in urban areas and other regions subject to climatic warming by cooling the surroundings and reflecting the solar energy. Transpiration from Phragmites leaves was twice that from S. alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) leaves in a New Jersey tidal marsh (Windham et al. 2001). Living and dead Phragmites have been recommended for stabilizing and protecting levees and spoil banks (Headlee 1945; Stutzenbaker 1999). Other services are listed in Table 1.

Habitat functions: how Phragmites supports biodiversity
Contrary to often-stated opinions, North American reedbeds support a great taxonomic, ecological and geographic diversity of native and non-native organisms (examples in Table 2; many more could be cited). These analyses require caution because many studies were qualitative, limited in spatial and temporal scope, or involved small samples.

Phragmites as food
Various insects feed on Phragmites (Balme 2000; Tewksbury et al., 2002; Lambert 2005; E. Kiviat, unpubl. data); many of these are believed to be non-native (Balme 2000). However, most studies of Phragmites insects have been in the eastern states and there are probably many insects associated with western Phragmites that remain to be documented. Insects include endophagous stem-feeders, leaf chewers, sap suckers, gall makers and a rhizome feeder. Usually, insect feeding does not cause significant damage; Balme (2000) found the greater wainscot moth Rhizedra lutosa causing minor damage in Rhode Island. On one occasion I found larvae of Simyra insularis (Noctuidae; Henry's marsh moth), a native, generalist feeder, heavily grazing Phragmites leaf blades where it grew sparsely among Calamagrostis canadensis (bluejoint grass), but not in the adjoining dense Phragmites stands (Fig. 7).

The non-native sap-feeding Chaetococcus phragmitis (reed scale) that is sessile beneath lower leaf sheaths may be widespread and abundant, at least in Old World Phragmites. Krause et al. (1997) found late-winter biomass of adults as high as 1 g dw m−2 in a freshwater tidal marsh on the Hudson River. I have frequently seen songbirds opening leaf sheaths and consuming the scale insects, especially in winter, in the northeastern states. Birds also commonly peck holes in Phragmites internodes and eat insects living within.

Hyalopterus pruni (mealy plum aphid) is widespread and abundant in North America (Balme 2000; Lambert 2005). This aphid alternates generations between Phragmites in summer and Prunus spp. (cherries, etc.) in winter; it is a pest of prune (Prunus domestica) orchards in California (Latham and Mills 2012). Although birds apparently do not feed on mealy plum aphid, Coccinellidae (lady beetles) are often present and presumably feed on the aphids.

Ondatra zibethicus (common muskrat) is the most important native vertebrate consumer of Phragmites. Muskrats feed on young shoots and rhizomes, and also cut mature culms for lodge construction. Several studies in different regions of North America have found Phragmites ranking from high to low among other plant species in the muskrat diet (Bellrose 1950; Paradiso 1969). Muskrats may use Phragmites intensively, depending on the availability of more ‘preferred’ foods such as Typha (cattail) and Scirpus (bulrush; Butler 1940; McCabe 1982). For example, Butler (1940) listed Phragmites as the fourth of 13 plant taxa in the muskrat diet in Manitoba; McCabe (1982) found Phragmites a close second to Scirpus in Utah; Phragmites was an important summer food in the north-central states (Errington 1941); in Maryland tidal marshes Typha and Scirpus were most important but Phragmites was ‘a favourite food, grows in beds of limited distribution, in which muskrats are always found’ (Smith 1938); and feeding on Phragmites in Louisiana coastal marshes varied according to marsh type (O'Neil 1949). Nonetheless, Ward (1942), Lynch et al. (1947) and Martin et al. (1957) considered Phragmites to be a low-quality or uncommonly eaten food. In Louisiana, 10 % or less of the muskrat activity (including feeding) was associated with Phragmites (O'Neil 1949), and muskrat use of Phragmites stands in Connecticut tidal marshes was consistently low (Benoit and Askins 1999). Muskrats may be abundant in habitats where Phragmites is highly dominant, as at times and places in the New Jersey Meadowlands (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Castor canadensis (American beaver) also uses Phragmites for construction and perhaps eats it as well, but possibly less so than the muskrat.

Sylvilagus spp. (cottontail rabbits) at times cut many Phragmites shoots for food (Balme 2000; E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Balme (2000) found extensive clipping of culms by Sylvilagus floridanus (eastern cottontail) in experimental Phragmites plots in Rhode Island. I found extensive clipping by S. floridanus at a lakeside wet meadow in Rockland County, New York, in 2011. In 2006 I observed much use of Phragmites stands (clipping of culms, shelter) by S. cf. audubonii (desert cottontail) in the Southwest. Domestic livestock (horses, cattle, goats, sheep) graze Phragmites, especially young shoots in spring, and have caused Phragmites declines in some cases (Kiviat and Hamilton 2001). Spatial patterns of reedbeds in relation to fences of livestock pastures in New York suggest that livestock inhibition of Phragmites is common. Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) may graze Phragmites in Louisiana but it is not a major food (Self et al. 1975). Branta canadensis (Canada goose) grazes Phragmites leaf blades, especially in urban marshes of the New York City area, but does not seem to do much damage (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Chen caerulescens (snow goose) feeds on Phragmites rhizomes in Gulf Coast marshes (Glazener 1946).

Dead Phragmites material (litter, detritus) provides food as well. Fungi and other microbes growing on decomposing wetland plants support detritivorous invertebrates (Gulis et al. 2006) and provide the basis for wetland food webs that are often more important than those based on herbivory. Most of the macroinvertebrates found in reedbed litter and soil (see Table 3) are probably deriving nutrition from dead Phragmites and associated microbes. Food webs based on Phragmites detritus, alone or as a significant portion of mixtures with other carbon sources, can support important fish populations (Wainwright et al. 2000; Weinstein et al. 2000) and therefore higher-order consumers that presumably include certain invertebrates, turtles, snakes, many kinds of birds, and mammals.

Phragmites as shelter, substrate and habitat (Fig. 8)
Reedbeds in which Phragmites is highly dominant are often called ‘monotypic’, ‘pure’, or ‘monodominant’. There may be an absence of other vascular plants at the scale of 1 m2 but rarely is this true at a larger scale, e.g. 100 m2. In many cases, stands of robust, dense Phragmites have smaller associated plants in the outer 1 m of reedbed edge, but support few species or individuals of other vascular plant species, or those other plants are stunted, in the stand interiors. Frequent associates in reedbed interiors include Peltandra virginica (arrow arum) and Impatiens capensis (orange jewelweed) in fresh water, and Atriplex prostrata (A. patula var. hastata; orache) in brackish water. Occasional individuals of larger woody or suffrutescent species such as Sambucus nigra ssp. canadensis (common elderberry), Ailanthus altissima (tree-of-heaven), or Hibiscus moscheutos (swamp rose mallow) may also occur; in some cases these plants may have been present before reedbed development. Betula pumila (swamp birch), a shrub or small tree, was present in a Massachusetts fen before Phragmites colonization, and when Phragmites was removed, B. pumila grew taller (J. M. Toro, Native Habitat Restoration, Stockbridge, MA, pers. comm.). Similarly, Taxodium distichum (bald-cypress) and Cephalanthus occidentalis (buttonbush) planted in a created non-tidal wetland in Beltsville, Maryland, persisted despite colonization by a dense stand of Phragmites (A. H. Baldwin, University of Maryland, USA, pers. comm.). Keller (2000) found the diversity of associated plants to be lower in Phragmites than in Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) or Typha. Meyerson et al. (2000) also compiled several studies showing lower vascular plant diversity in reedbeds.

Reedbeds can be dense, with Phragmites highly dominant, or sparse with other species admixed. For example, in September 2000, I found 18 species of associated vascular plants (three herbaceous and one woody vines, two shrubs, two suffrutescent herbs, two ferns, and eight other herbs) in the interior of a reedbed that had been harvested annually and occasionally burned in the New Jersey Meadowlands (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). These associated species were sparse and occurred just outside the most recently harvested area. Reedbeds that are sparse, deeply flooded, or subject to high hydrodynamic energy (e.g. shorelines of open tidal waters) may support a greater diversity of vascular plants in edges. The occurrence of rare vascular plants and mosses in the interiors or edges of reedbeds under some circumstances suggests that Phragmites is facilitating the associated species by ameliorating harsh environmental conditions. Some of the cases I have observed are in relatively high-energy (wave-washed) tidal shores where sparse reedbeds appeared to be physically sheltering smaller plants of other species or maintaining favourable substrates against wave erosion. At Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in New York City, Platanthera lacera (ragged fringed orchid), a regionally rare species, was found beneath mixed upland stands of Phragmites and Betula populifolia (grey birch), and nowhere else (D. Taft, U.S. National Park Service, New York, NY, pers. comm.). On the Hudson River, three rare native species, Limosella subulata (mudwort) and Lilaeopsis chinensis (eastern lilaeopsis) in brackish tidal wetlands, and Cardamine longii (Long's bittercress) in fresh-tidal wetlands, occur in reedbed edges where the Phragmites may be facilitating these small plants by providing physical shelter, stabilizing the sediments, or oxygenating the soil (the last phenomenon was suggested as a process by which Phragmites facilitated plants less tolerant to soil hypoxia; Callaway 1995).

Vines, both woody and herbaceous species, use Phragmites for support. Vines are especially frequent and sometimes constitute considerable phytomass at the upland edges of reedbeds and on channel banks where the substrate may be slightly higher. Cuscuta (dodder) occasionally parasitizes Phragmites; all other vines are non-parasitic. Certain robust woody vines that ordinarily use woody plants or permanent structures such as fences for support evidently are able to reach from old overwintered Phragmites culms to new shoots of the current year. I have documented >30 species of vines, half native and half non-native, using Phragmites as the host (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Vines modify reedbed architecture and provide additional food resources for animals.

Diverse mosses and a few liverworts occur beneath reedbed edges and interiors on soil or culm bases (Barbour and Kiviat 2007; G. Stevens, Hudsonia, Annandale, NY, pers. comm.; E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Bryophytes appear to be more abundant and diverse beneath Phragmites where it grows sparsely and the substrate is wet but not long-flooded. A rare species in New York, the moss Philonotis muhlenbergii, was found beneath Phragmites on a Hudson River island (Barbour and Kiviat 2007). Algae colonize the lower portions of culms. Epiphyton (algae, particularly diatoms) was similar in Phragmites and Typha in an Ohio marsh (Back 2010).

Reedbeds may retain ice and remain cooler than their surroundings in spring (Meyerson et al. 2000). The resulting cool microclimate may inhibit some biota. Possibly some of these cool reedbeds shelter species near their southern range limits that require cool habitats.

The greater height of Phragmites compared with other wetland herbs is a resource for certain species. Although the nests of Ammodramus maritimus (seaside sparrow) were placed low in native graminoids in Massachusetts, the birds most often sang from Phragmites or a shrub [Iva frutescens (marsh-elder); Marshall and Reinert 1990]. Phragmites located at higher substrate elevations in or near marshes, and perhaps the robust nature of the reedbed itself, can provide shelter from higher than normal tides or floods, as evidenced by nesting Larus atricilla (laughing gull) in New Jersey (Burger and Shisler 1980).

Particular features of reedbeds attract birds in many instances. Anatinae (dabbling ducks) loafed on cattle-trampled reedbeds at the Delta Marshes, Manitoba (Sowls 1955). Small, reed-bordered channels were used by ducks during bad weather in the New Jersey Meadowlands [R. Kane, New Jersey Audubon Society (retired), Bernardsville, NJ, pers. comm.]. Reedbeds, especially those with standing water, attract large numbers of roosting songbirds, as reported in published studies and qualitative observations (Table 2); in one example, there was a peak of 40 000 Dolichonyx oryzivorus (bobolink; Iliff and Lovitch 2007). In the Delta Marshes of Manitoba, where native Phragmites is a dominant species, Circus cyaneus (northern harrier) nested in the edges between Phragmites and Scholochloa festucacea (whitetop grass). Phragmites was the most abundant plant in the vicinity of five nests (Hecht 1951).

Few data are available regarding Phragmites support of amphibians and reptiles, although various species have been found in reedbeds (Table 2). Under certain circumstances, reptiles appear to be using reedbeds for overwintering or thermoregulation (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Storeria dekayi dekayi (northern brown snake) individuals have been found beneath small piles of recently cut Phragmites culms in a non-tidal marsh restoration site in New York City (V. Ruzicka, Randall's Island Park Alliance, New York, NY, pers. comm.).

Phragmites as nest material
Many birds use Phragmites culm, leaf, or inflorescence material in their nests. Common muskrat and American beaver use culm and rhizome material in lodge construction. No information is available comparing Phragmites with alternate materials. Muskrat and beaver lodge construction may disperse living fragments of rhizome or culm base because some of the nest material remains wet.

Phragmites as a buffer
The tall, dense, resilient masses of Phragmites often provide a buffer between human activities or cattle grazing and wetland wildlife (Ward 1942; Buchsbaum 1991). Phragmites screens out some of the noise and visual disturbances. Dense woody thickets can provide the same function, although reedbeds often occur at marsh edges in urban areas and other places that lack dense shrubs or trees. Reedbeds also buffer other organisms from winds. On Lake Poygan, Wisconsin, artificial nesting platforms for Sterna fosteri (Foster's tern) were anchored in reedbeds to provide shelter for the nests (Mossman et al. 1988). Dense reedbeds are noisy when a human or a predator forces its way through the Phragmites culms; this warns smaller animals hiding or roosting in the reedbeds.

Habitat combinations
Mobile animals, such as birds, many mammals, and strongly flying insects, commonly use combinations of habitats to acquire all the resources they need. A reedbed can support one type of activity by a species while an adjacent or nearby alternate habitat can support another type of activity. In Marshlands Sanctuary (New York), Rallus longirostris (clapper rail) nested in a narrow fringe of Phragmites at the upland edge of a brackish tidal marsh, and foraged in the adjacent S. alterniflora at a slightly lower elevation in the marsh (A. Beal, Westchester County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation (retired), Ardsley, NY, pers. comm.). In marshes of the Hudson River and the New Jersey Meadowlands, larvae of Poanes viator (broad-winged skipper, a butterfly) feed on Phragmites leaves in the reedbeds, and the adults fly out of the reedbeds to feed on flower nectar of L. salicaria (purple loosestrife), Nepeta cataria (catnip), and other plants.

Comparisons of Phragmites and alternate habitats
I have compiled studies that compared the density (abundance) or taxon richness of invertebrates, fishes, and birds in Phragmites and alternate habitats (Tables 3–5). Density apparently varies by animal taxon, alternate habitat, environmental setting, season, survey method, and other factors. Table 3 shows comparisons of invertebrate assemblages in Phragmites and alternate habitats according to 20 studies. Most of these have been performed in tidal marshes of the East Coast, and most sampled nektonic or macrobenthic taxa. There is wide variation in the results of these heterogeneous studies, with density or richness less than, equal to or greater than that in Phragmites; however, Phragmites more often has lower density or richness than alternate habitats. Posey et al. (2003) found that the differences were due more to microtopography than to the plant per se for benthic invertebrates.

bThese three species used a single habitat exclusively; four additional species nested in both Phragmites and woody vegetation. Among the latter group, cattle egret had greater nest success in Phragmites, little blue heron had greater success in upland woody vegetation, and snowy egret productivity varied.

cNesting in patches dominated by the different plants was proportional to availability.

dOne Phragmites-dominated marsh had the greatest density of rails compared with the expected value; two Typha marshes had high densities and one had a low density.

eNormally nested in SpA or less often SpP; in year of flood tides during April nested in Phragmites.

fTotal individuals and species richness in breeding season related to total volume of annual plants, Phragmites, and Phoradendron californicum (mistletoe). In non-breeding season, Thryomanes bewickii related to Phragmites and Acacia greggii (catclaw); total individuals and species richness related to total annuals, Phragmites, and Phoradendron californicum.

gEgrets foraged in pools within SpA or SpP but not in Phragmites stands. Phragmites mostly occurred at the upland edges of the marshes.



Table 4 shows 16 fish studies that compared reedbeds with alternate habitats. Entire fish assemblages tend to be similar in Phragmites and S. alterniflora (or Typha) marshes or less dense in the Phragmites; in some cases the Phragmites marshes studied were tide restricted. However, the results for a small, abundant, and ecologically important tidal marsh fish Fundulus heteroclitus (mummichog) are different. Adult mummichogs are typically equally abundant in Phragmites and alternate plant communities, and spawn in both communities. Larval and small juvenile mummichogs are consistently less abundant in Phragmites. Raichel et al. (2003) hypothesized that young mummichogs were less abundant in Phragmites because of sparser prey resources. Although Osgood et al. (2006) found fewer juvenile mummichogs in Phragmites compared with Typha, this difference was apparently not related to benthic macroinvertebrate density or taxon richness. Weinstein et al. (2009) found lower levels of a biochemical indicator of condition, triacylglycerols, in F. heteroclitus from Phragmites compared with S. alterniflora. Dibble and Meyerson (2012) found that F. heteroclitus were healthier, as indicated by several morphological and physiological metrics, in tidally restored marshes with less Phragmites compared with tidally restricted marshes dominated by Phragmites in Rhode Island.

Raposa and Roman (2003) sampled three restricted–unrestricted marsh pairs where fish assemblages were less species rich with greater tide restriction; all restricted marshes were Phragmites dominated. Comparisons of fish assemblages in untreated Phragmites and herbicide-treated Phragmites have yielded variable results (Warren et al. 2001; Buchsbaum et al. 2006; Fell et al. 2006). In some cases the designs of nekton studies were confounded by elevation differences between Phragmites reedbeds and alternate habitats (e.g. Osgood et al. 2003), lack of measurement of elevation, or possibly hydrology and salinity rather than Phragmites per se.

Meyer (2003) found amphibian species richness to be similar in Phragmites, Typha, and ‘marsh meadow’ in non-tidal wetlands of Long Point (Lake Erie), Ontario, but a lower abundance in Phragmites compared with the alternate habitats. Also at Long Point, Bolton and Brooks (2010) documented rapidly spreading upland Phragmites overgrowing and detrimentally shading nest sites of freshwater turtles during incubation.

Relatively much is known about bird use of Phragmites, although this information is distributed unevenly by taxon, season, geographic region, and habitat (Table 5). In some cases, birds appear to actively select Phragmites habitat. Examples include Sterna hirundo (common tern) nesting in offshore reedbeds in Lake Poygan, Wisconsin (L. Bodensteiner, Western Washington University, USA, unpubl. data), Oxyura jamaicensis (ruddy duck) and Fulica americana (American coot) nesting only in reedbeds in New Jersey (Kane 2001a, b), and flocks of Hirundinidae (swallows), Icteridae (blackbirds), and other songbirds roosting in reedbeds in a freshwater tidal marsh on the Hudson River (Kiviat and Talmage 2006). In Maryland, blackbirds flew from as far away as 25 km to roost in reedbeds (Meanley 1993). Certain other species of birds have been found to avoid reedbeds, such as Leucophaeus pipixcan (Franklin's gull) at Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in Utah (Olson 2007). Three species of conservation concern in Connecticut, Catoptrophorus semipalmatus (willet), Ammodramus caudacutus (saltmarsh sparrow), and A. maritimus (seaside sparrow), nested in the short graminoid meadows (Spartina patens, etc.) of the high salt marsh (Benoit and Askins 1999) and not in reedbeds. However, DiQuinzio et al. (2002), in nearby Rhode Island, found saltmarsh sparrow nesting in short Phragmites as well as in short native graminoids in a tidally restricted marsh. Although Sowls (1955) reported that nests of five species of Anatinae (dabbling ducks) were more common in alternate grass communities than in Phragmites, in the same wetland complex Ward (1942) stated that 31 % of 147 nests of ‘land-nesting’ ducks were in Phragmites edges. Ward considered water edges and wet meadow edges of reedbeds, mats of lodged culms in the water edges of reedbeds, small beds surrounded by wet meadow, and newly established, sparse reedbeds to be particularly favourable locations for duck nests. The difference between these two studies may have been due to the definition of reedbed edges or to reedbed management.

Of 17 studies of breeding birds in reedbeds compared with an alternate habitat (Table 5), there were about 16 instances of species that were more abundant in Phragmites, and about 36 instances of species more abundant in the alternate habitat (these tallies include some duplication of species among studies). Of six studies of non-breeding birds, there were about 13 instances of species that were more abundant in reedbeds and three instances of species more abundant in the alternate habitat. These numbers suggest that reedbeds offer more functions to non-breeding birds (e.g. cover for roosting and escape from predators), but the fact that >75 species of North American birds have been reported to be breeding in Phragmites-dominated habitat (some examples in Table 2) indicates the need for a broader range of studies. Meyer's (2003) study of birds in Phragmites, Typha, and marsh meadow at a Lake Erie site in Ontario indicated the complexity of Phragmites–bird relationships, which varied by habitat, stand edge compared with interior, season, and bird species. At a large and longstanding rookery on Pea Patch Island in Delaware Bay (Parsons 2003), two species of long-legged wading birds nested only in upland shrubs and trees, four species nested in that woody vegetation as well as in Phragmites marsh, and one species nested only in reedbeds. Of the four species that nested in both habitats, one had greater egg and nestling productivity in the reedbeds and one had greater productivity in the woody vegetation. Although alternate habitats may be better for more species, there are many cases where reedbeds are better for a particular species.

No bird that breeds in the U.S. or Canada is known to depend wholly on Phragmites, although certain birds breed only in Phragmites marshes in particular regions (e.g. Fulica americana and Oxyura jamaicensis in New Jersey (Kane 2001a, b). Geothlypis beldingi (Belding's yellowthroat, a wood warbler endemic to the oases of Baja California Sur, Mexico) breeds only in association with Phragmites reedbeds (Rodríguez-Estrella et al. 1999).

Although various species of small and large mammals have been reported using reedbeds (Table 2), few quantitative data are available. Meyer (2003) found greater abundance and richness of small mammals in Phragmites compared with Typha or marsh meadow in non-tidal wetlands of Long Point, Ontario. However, Meyer (2003) found white-tailed deer tracks to be more common in grass and sedge-dominated marsh meadow and Typha compared with Phragmites. Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) and the non-native Mus musculus (house mouse) frequented reedbeds in a Connecticut estuary, whereas Microtus pennsylvanicus (meadow vole) was more common in Spartina patens marsh (Holland and Smith 1980). McGlynn (2006) found the small-mammal species richness to be similar in Phragmites and two alternate habitats but P. leucopus more abundant in Phragmites in Hudson River fresh-tidal marshes.

Phragmites is used by many different organisms. In most cases it is not known whether these interactions are beneficial or detrimental to the species associated with Phragmites. In at least a few cases, Phragmites appears beneficial: roosting birds in reedbeds, songbirds eating seeds during migration or winter, animals taking refuge from flooding in reedbeds elevated above the surroundings, and small mammals like Sylvilagus (cottontails) hiding in reedbeds. In other cases, Phragmites appears detrimental: rapidly colonizing and shading turtle nesting sites, displacing the short graminoid community of high salt marsh on the northeastern coast, and supporting fewer young F. heteroclitus than in S. alterniflora-dominated wetlands. If it were possible to replace the Phragmites with fully functioning alternate habitats, would there be a real benefit to these species? Does the presence of reedbeds decrease the overall population of F. heteroclitus? The absence or scarcity of a species in a habitat does not necessarily mean that the habitat quality is poor (van Horne 1983). We need to understand the effects of Phragmites on a species at the levels of population and fitness, as well as the mechanisms of those effects, for each species. McGlynn (2006) found the body condition of small mammals, and mammalian predation on artificial songbird nests, to be similar in Phragmites and two alternate habitats. Parsons (2003) found the hatching success of Egretta thula (snowy egret) and Egretta caerulea (little blue heron) to be greater in woody vegetation and nestling survival of E. caerulea greater in woody vegetation, whereas the hatching success of Bubulcus ibis (cattle egret) was greater in reedbeds, and nestling survival of E. thula and B. ibis did not differ between habitats.

Reedbed characteristics and habitat functions
What makes a reedbed attractive to other organisms? The tall, dense masses of leafy culms where Phragmites is more highly dominant provide shelter from weather and predators to arthropods, small birds, and other small organisms, but may be too dense or shady for small plants or larger animals. However, large birds such as Circus cyaneus (northern harrier), Ardeidae (herons) and Threskiornithidae (ibises) can roost or nest on top of reedbeds with some degree of culm lodging. Large animals, such as O. virginianus (white-tailed deer), are sometimes able to break trails through dense reedbeds. Other Phragmites characteristics that shape its habitat functions include mats of lodged culms that animals rest on or under, hollow internodes of broken dead culms that shelter spiders, and the soil-stabilizing ability that apparently attracts Castor canadensis and O. zibethicus to build lodges. Some organisms are associated with high-biomass reedbeds whereas others are associated with low-biomass (sparse, short or fragmented) reedbeds.

The more we learn about how reedbed characteristics are beneficial or detrimental to particular species, the better we can manage Phragmites for particular biodiversity goals. It appears that extensive, dense beds of tall reeds support fewer species of breeding birds in the northeastern states than do small reedbeds, reedbeds with an admixture of other herbaceous or woody plants, sparse reedbeds and reedbeds in which patches of Phragmites are interspersed with pools or clearings (Fig. 9). Breeding season activity of Gallinula chloropus (common moorhen) in mine-associated wetlands was concentrated along reedbed edges and where reedbeds were interspersed with open water and abundant Lemna (duckweed) (Horstman et al. 1998). Nonetheless, C. cyaneus on the New Jersey and New York coast nested preferentially in dense, extensive reedbeds, although the same species in Manitoba nested in reedbed edges (Table 2). Meyer (2003) found greater abundance of birds in reedbed edges compared with interiors. Ward (1942) stated that few ducks nested in extensive dense reedbeds, but that small reedbeds and reedbed edges were highly selected. Possibly the edges of reedbeds are more attractive to foraging or nesting birds, as is often the case in Typha or other non-Phragmites wetland vegetation (Kostecke et al. 2004).

Litter, including lodged culms and culm stubble, affects animal use of reedbeds. Turdus migratorius (American robin) nested on mats of lodged culms (Hudson 1994). I observed Sylvilagus cf. audubonii in the Southwest using the same feature of reedbeds (Fig. 5).

Various intrinsic (stand) and extrinsic (environmental) variables may affect the suitability of Phragmites as habitat (Kiviat 2009b, 2010). Important intrinsic variables are reedbed extent and shape, the ratio of edge to interior, culm height and density, aboveground biomass, the ratio of fertile (flowering or fruiting) to sterile culms, lodging, litter mass and admixture (understory herbs, woody plants, vines, mosses). Important extrinsic variables are the presence of clearings or pools, soil microtopography and elevation, herbivory (beaver, muskrat, livestock, insects), surrounding land use and vegetation, human activities, proximity of other reedbeds, hydropattern (water levels, vertical and horizontal movement, and timing), soil texture and organic matter content, salinity, water quality, and the effects of ice, floods and fire. Phragmites reedbeds in tidal marshes tend to have more live biomass and litter mass, less microtopographic relief, and higher substrate elevation than the alternate plant communities such as Spartina spp. that Phragmites appears to replace (e.g. Meyerson et al. 2000; Angradi et al. 2001).

So far, there have been few studies comparing biodiversity support of different Phragmites haplotypes. Native haplotypes of P. australis tend to grow more sparsely with an admixture of other plants, compared with Old World Phragmites (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Differences in insect use of the subspecies were addressed by Lambert (2005).

The data summarized from many studies (Tables 2–5) indicate several possible generalizations about the biodiversity support services provided by Phragmites. There are many native and non-native species that occur in association with reedbeds. Some of these species are common in reedbeds, and some prefer reedbed edges while others also occur in reedbed interiors. In certain cases, mobile animals are clearly selecting reedbeds in landscapes containing alternate communities; roosting songbirds may be the best example. Because Phragmites (at least Old World Phragmites) tends to form dense stands with large amounts of live and dead biomass, many other vascular plants may not do well beneath the Phragmites canopies. In some cases, larger animals may have difficulty moving through reedbeds. None of these characteristics is unique to Phragmites; dense, low-diversity, high-biomass stands of Typha, Scirpus, tall Carex (sedge) species and other robust colonial marsh plants are similar in many respects.

Effects of other organisms on Phragmites
Phragmites is affected by many other non-human organisms; animals eat it, gall it, collect it for nest material and trample on it; taller plants shade it; fungi infect it; beavers flood it; and vines weigh it down. These interactions rarely seem to have a large impact. Probably the most common large effect of other organisms is due to Ondatra (muskrat) activities in cutting and excavating rhizomes and culm bases for food and lodge construction. Beaver activities may create habitat for Phragmites on abandoned dams and the bottoms of drawn-down abandoned ponds, but may also inhibit or kill Phragmites by flooding it. Although in many respects the reedbeds of today are relatively unaffected by the activities of other organisms, three types of interaction are worth noting: (i) sublethal effects that may alter productivity, reedbed architecture or other aspects of Phragmites; (ii) effects of prehistoric megafauna that may have been greater than animal effects seen now; and (iii) changing biotic interactions including the establishment of non-native species or increases in species already here.

Although many insects, non-native and native, feed on Phragmites, it is not generally regulated by insect herbivory (Balme 2000). However, I have seen local instances of significant damage to Phragmites patches by insect and muskrat herbivory. The muskrat, because it can reach high population densities, has the potential to inhibit or remove Phragmites in small and sometimes large areas; this activity can diversify reedbed vegetation. The combination of feeding on rhizomes and culm bases by muskrats and Cyprinus carpio (common carp) with high water levels and wind waves apparently caused recession of reedbeds in Kearny Marsh West in the Meadowlands in the early 2000s (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). Muskrats, possibly in combination with insects or unidentified factors, fragmented a reedbed in South Glebe Marsh at Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary on the freshwater tidal Patuxent River in Maryland, and a few years later a vigorous but floristically diverse floating reedbed had developed at this site (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data). In the fen meadows of upper Moore Brook, Salisbury, Connecticut, Phragmites colonizing Carex meadows was alternately inhibited or facilitated by increases or decreases, respectively, in water levels caused by changes in beaver activity (E. Kiviat, unpubl. data).

Nothrotheriops shastensis (Shasta ground sloth, an extinct large mammal) fed intensively on Phragmites at an Arizona locality 40 000 years ago (Hansen 1978). Mammuthus primigenius (woolly mammoth, another Pleistocene megaherbivore) ate P. australis in Russia (Farrand 1961) and presumably did so in North America. Other Pleistocene large mammals, such as the Castoroides spp. (giant beavers) and many species of Equidae (horses), as well as Holocene mammals once much more abundant than now, such as Bison bison (American bison), may also have eaten Phragmites, as modern relatives do (Peden et al. 1974). Large animals such as these could have regulated or controlled Phragmites to an extent that is not seen now with wild mammals but is evident with livestock.

Is Old World Phragmites acquiring a biota in North America?
Non-native plants acquire a fauna of herbivorous insects in ∼30–200 years as a result of genetic adaptation of herbivores (Imura 1999; Carroll et al. 2005; Carroll 2007; Hawkes 2007) and possibly other processes. Non-native plants can also evolve to become less toxic to natural enemies and competitors (Lankau et al. 2009). The time required for adaptations to a non-native plant by users other than herbivorous insects has not been estimated. Old World Phragmites appears to be acquiring a biota after more than a century here. Many of the organisms that use Phragmites are generalists, excepting some of its insect herbivores. However, because native Phragmites is so similar to Old World Phragmites, organisms pre-adapted to using one should be able to switch relatively easily to the other.

There are several possible explanations for use of Old World Phragmites by any particular native species: (i) the species uses Phragmites as a result of exploratory behaviour or accident; (ii) Phragmites provides a low-quality resource where better habitat is not available, or is occupied by spillover (population pressure) from a better habitat that is saturated; (iii) a species is adapted to use non-native Phragmites because of pre-adaptation to native Phragmites or other tall graminoids; (iv) a species is an ecological generalist whose ‘partner’ range includes Phragmites; or (v) there has been recent evolutionary adaptation to increasingly widespread, abundant, robust, productive Old World Phragmites (it is also possible that Old World Phragmites has undergone recent evolution making it more suitable, e.g. more palatable, to a particular organism). Possibilities (iii) and (v) would result from fitness advantages gained by e.g. refuge from predation, harsh weather, human disturbance or another stressor. A species that encounters Phragmites by chance (option i) may eventually develop a more intimate relationship with Phragmites.

Implications for management
Because Phragmites can provide substantial ecosystem services, as well as being a pest, it requires a management approach that is tailored to individual sites and sets of local management goals (Kiviat 2010). An approach that requires or encourages attempts to kill non-native taxa everywhere is impractical, causes non-target damage to sensitive species and wastes resources. The sanctity of native over non-native taxa has been challenged by, for example, Botkin (2001) and Cole et al. (2010). In order to focus efforts on situations where non-native taxa actually threaten sensitive native species or communities, it will be necessary to leave alone portions of stands or even entire stands of dominant non-native plants in certain situations. Although one plant community may support higher density or species richness than another, in most cases it is not richness per se that matters to nature conservation on a large scale, and it is more important to foster one or more species because it is a rare species or a resource (e.g. human food) species. In the case of Phragmites, I propose that the general management goal be the support of biodiversity through conservation of important species, balanced with promoting the ecosystem services and human uses provided by reedbeds. Specific goals should be set only after thorough biological surveys and realistic assessment of the long-term sustainability of any management action. Below I discuss problems with proposed and currently used management techniques and Phragmites research, and suggest future research directions.

Problems with proposed biological control
Classical biological control, in which specialized natural enemies from the non-native plant's native range are introduced to the non-native range, is being developed for Old World Phragmites (Tewksbury et al. 2002; Blossey 2003). Once classical biocontrol organisms are released and established, they are intended to support themselves. Given the ecosystem services provided by Phragmites, there are several problems inherent in this approach. Biocontrol is likely to cause significant damage to reedbeds established for sewage sludge dewatering or nutrient removal from wastewater. Biocontrol is likely to cause the decline of, or alter the architecture of, reedbeds serving as habitat for marsh and water birds of conservation concern, and providing non-habitat ecosystem services such as stabilization and accretion of tidal marsh soils and carbon sequestration. Specialized natural enemies commonly switch hosts or may have host ranges broader than known; this phenomenon is well documented in insect herbivores (Strong et al. 1984; McEvoy and Coombs 2000). Biocontrol for Phragmites is intended to affect Old World Phragmites but not native Phragmites (Lambert 2005). Nonetheless, natural enemies specialized on Old World Phragmites are likely to switch to native Phragmites. The potential for host switching will put at risk all organisms that depend locally or regionally on native Phragmites for food or habitat, including G. beldingi, Ochlodes yuma (Yuma skipper) and any other Phragmites-dependent insects of western North America. The potential for loss of biodiversity is illustrated by the recent description of a new species of fly from native Phragmites in New York (Eichiner et al., 2011). Furthermore, biocontrol has the potential to affect the ability of western and Mexican Native Americans to continue, or resume, using Phragmites in ceremonies, for ecological restoration, or for numerous other historical uses (see Kiviat and Hamilton 2001).

Once biocontrol is released and established widely, it cannot be ‘taken back’; the only way to protect reedbeds that provide valuable services would be to apply pesticides to kill the biocontrol organisms, and those pesticides could cause disruption of biodiversity and other services. Classical biocontrol, thus, would foreclose the option of managing reedbeds on a goal-directed and site-specific basis (Kiviat 2010; see below).

Problems with other management techniques
More than any other technique, herbicides have been used to manage Phragmites (thousands of hectares in Delaware Bay alone), and most often the chemicals used have been glyphosate or one of its formulations. These herbicides have engendered genetic resistance in a number of weed species, and there is toxicological research indicating endocrine disruption, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity in animals (Kiviat 2009a). Even glyphosate used as a cut-culm treatment on Phragmites can leak into the environment and harm non-target plants (J. M. Toro, pers. comm.). Prescribed livestock grazing, although often effective for managing habitat for the endangered bog turtle (Tesauro 2001a, b), may harm certain non-target plant species. Mechanical control may also harm non-target plants. Removal of Phragmites by any technique may destabilize sediments, mobilize contaminants and result in marsh loss. All these techniques, nonetheless, have a place in the large-scale strategy of management.

Research needs and problems
Although there has been much research on North American Phragmites in recent years, these studies have been affected by the methodological problems described here.

Phragmites morphology and reedbed architecture
The often dense tall culms impede observer vision and movement, and the abundant, silica-rich, standing dead culms make a loud noise when walked through. It is difficult to detect animals visually, estimate distances to those animals observed and move through reedbeds without scaring (or attracting) birds and other wildlife. Observer trails, and call playback used for surveying birds, can alter the behaviour of animals and cause them to move out of, or into, the reedbeds. These problems could be addressed through the use of small-scale remote sensing, including remote audio or video recording, camera traps, and possibly miniature remotely controlled aircraft (multicopters; Koch et al. 2011).

Genetic diversity
Native and non-native Phragmites are difficult to identify in the field, and in many cases genetic laboratory identification is necessary. Most studies cited here were conducted before genetic elucidation of Phragmites haplotypes, and voucher specimens of Phragmites apparently were not collected in most cases. As a result, we know little about the differences in ecological relationships between different Phragmites haplotypes.

Spatial and temporal bias
Most of the quantitative studies have been performed in tidal, rather than non-tidal, environments. For example, of 22 bird studies in Table 5, 15 were conducted in tidal environments. Almost all of the fish and invertebrate studies were conducted in tidal environments (Tables 3 and 4).

Reedbeds, and their biotic associates, are highly variable in space and time. It is necessary to sample widely to capture this diversity. Most of the quantitative studies reported here were performed in the New England or Middle Atlantic states. A few of the quantitative studies were performed before 1990. Most studies have used one or two study areas and sampled for 1 or 2 years. It is not known if the findings can be generalized to larger spatial and temporal scales.

Amount and location of information
Old World Phragmites is probably the most-studied non-native plant in North America. There is a large amount of information on Phragmites use by other organisms. Much of this information is qualitative, and much is in the grey literature or unwritten (see Table 2). Collecting and analysing this information is a formidable task, and I have probably compiled only a small portion of it in this paper.

General difficulties affecting studies of non-native organisms
Studies of Phragmites and other non-native plants in North America have typically begun with hypotheses of negative impacts on other organisms, potentially creating a bias in selecting research questions, study sites and methods, and interpreting results. In many cases, crucial habitat characteristics (e.g. substrate elevation in tidal marshes) have not been measured. Most studies have focused on relatively well-known groups of organisms (especially fishes, breeding birds, macrobenthic or nektonic estuarine invertebrates, and herbivorous insects) that may not represent ecological relationships of Phragmites with other taxa or guilds (taxonomic bias is also widespread with regard to rare species in conservation research and policy-making; Martín-López et al. 2009). Consideration of the biodiversity support functions of Phragmites has often been limited to food (e.g. for specialized herbivorous insects). Comparisons between biotas of Phragmites and alternate communities have almost always been based on population density (or catch-per-effort) or species richness, metrics that may not capture critical habitat functions of Phragmites for the most important species.

I have difficulty thinking of an a priori reason why a non-native plant should necessarily have a negative impact on a native species of animal or plant. There are many examples of non-native plants providing benefits to native organisms. One of the best documented is Tamarix (salt-cedar) as the breeding habitat for an endangered bird, Empidonax traillii extimus (southwestern willow flycatcher; Owen et al. 2005; Sogge et al. 2008). Another is the use of non-native larval host plants by a large number of butterfly species, benefiting certain species and harming others (Graves and Shapiro 2003). The concept of a priori neutrality is supported by many of the examples cited in this paper. Therefore I urge that researchers begin their studies of non-native plants with a null model (i.e. no differences compared with random).

Other experimental design considerations
Important environmental and stand variables should be measured or described as appropriate. In addition to breeding activities, the roosting and foraging activities of birds in various seasons need study. Other important groups needing study, in addition to fishes, estuarine invertebrates and herbivorous insects, include vascular plants, bryophytes, algae, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, terrestrial molluscs, butterflies, odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) and spiders. Species of conservation concern should receive priority attention, along with economically important species and keystone species or ecological engineers. Comparisons between Phragmites and alternate plant communities should consider, in addition to population density and species richness, functional metrics such as organism health (condition), diet, behaviour, reproduction and fitness. Guntenspergen and Nordby (2006) stated that experimental studies were needed to determine the impacts of Phragmites on terrestrial vertebrates of tidal marshes. Studies should include designs that examine responses of biota to experimental management of reedbeds, including partial removal of Phragmites biomass.

Conclusions
Phragmites, and Phragmites-dominated habitats, support many ecosystem services and diverse native and non-native biota. Studies comparing the density of individuals or the numbers of taxa (species) in reedbeds and alternate habitats show variable results. Reedbeds apparently support fewer individuals or taxa of certain kinds of invertebrates, fishes and birds, such as early life stages of the mummichog, three species of high salt marsh breeding birds, and muskrat, than do alternate habitats.

Top-ranked food preferences, and relative density or taxon richness of breeding birds, monophagous herbivores and other groups, are not the only currency by which to judge Phragmites. Other important considerations include the rare species supported by reedbeds; the habitat functions of reedbeds for roosting, escape from predators and shelter from floods and other extreme conditions; the ability of Phragmites to vegetate urban habitats and derelict lands without human inputs; and other non-habitat ecological services provided by Phragmites. Given the severe changes in American landscapes and biotas resulting from land use, alteration of hydrology and chemistry, and climate change, concepts of the purity of native communities may not be practical for application to abundant, widespread, long-present non-native taxa such as Old World Phragmites. These arguments do not contravene controlling Phragmites where it is clearly a threat to important elements of biodiversity.

The use of Phragmites in wastewater management will continue to be important if it is not affected by biocontrol. Phragmites has good potential for bioenergy. The use of Phragmites fibre for paper, insulation and industrial materials should be explored. Given the new information presented here, we should look at Phragmites management as an optimization: how can we manage to increase and make use of the valuable ecosystem services provided by the plant, while reducing the harm that it causes in certain situations?
