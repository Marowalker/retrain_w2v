identify traits that enable the alien tree Casuarina equisetifolia
to overcome barriers to survival and reproductive and to become naturalized on sandy
coastal plains. Restinga vegetation in Brazil was used as a model system to
conceptualize and quantify key stressors (high temperature, solar radiation, drought
and salinity) which can limit the initial establishment of the plants. Experiments
were conducted to evaluate the effects of these environmental factors on seed
persistence in the soil (field), germination (laboratory), survival, growth,
phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic integration (greenhouse). Results show that the
expected viability of the seeds in the soil was 50 months. Seeds germinated in a
similar way in constant and alternating temperatures (20–40 °C),
except at 40 °C. Low light, and water and salt stresses reduced
germination, but seeds recovered germination when stress diminished. Young plants did
not tolerate water stress (<2 % of soil moisture) or deep shade. Growth was
greater in sunny than in shady conditions. Although a low degree of phenotypic
plasticity is important in habitats with multiple stress factors, this species
exhibited high germination plasticity, although young plants showed low plasticity.
The positive effect of phenotypic integration on plastic expression in the shade
shows that in stressful environments traits that show greater phenotypic plasticity
values may have significant phenotypic correlations with other characters, which is
an important factor in the evolutionary ecology of this invasive species. Long-term
seed persistence in the soil, broad germination requirements (temperature and light
conditions) and the capacity to survive in a wide range of light intensity favours
its naturalization. However, C. equisetifolia did not tolerate water
stress and deep shade, which limit its potential to become naturalized on sandy
coastal plain.

Introduction
Biological invasions are conceptualized as occurring along an
introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum (Blackburn et al. 2011; Richardson and Pyšek 2012). As all naturalized species
have the potential to become invasive, naturalization is a critical stage of the
invasion process (Richardson and Pyšek
2012). For an introduced population to become naturalized, it must overcome
biotic and abiotic barriers to survival and reproduction (Blackburn et al. 2011). Research on
naturalized populations is important for elucidating the ecological factors and species
traits that mediate the transition of a population from casual to naturalized, but it is
surprising that this phase is rarely explored in studies of invasions (Pyšek et al. 2008;
Richardson and Pyšek 2012). In
general, reproductive traits, such as seed bank longevity, seed germination and seedling
survival and growth (Pyšek and Richardson
2007), in addition to high phenotypic plasticity and high phenotypic
integration (Pigliucci 2003; Hamilton et al. 2005; Richards et al. 2006) are
considered to be important determinants of invasiveness. However, we know of no studies
that evaluate the importance of all these factors together in mediating the transition
of a population from casual to naturalize.

High levels of plasticity can increase the average fitness of a species, thereby
expressing advantageous phenotypes that facilitate invasion across a wide range of new
environments (Richards et al.
2006; Funk 2008; Molina-Montenegro et al.
2012). Nonetheless, plasticity is not necessarily a crucial factor in
invasiveness (Peperkorn et al.
2005; Godoy et al.
2011; Palacio-López and Gianoli
2011). It seems to be less relevant in habitats that experience the effects of
multiple stress factors, where convergence to a low degree of phenotypic plasticity and
high canalization may be advantageous (Valladares
et al. 2007). Considering that the phenotype expressed by
plants is the result of the integration of their characters in each environmental
condition (Pigliucci 2003), it has been
suggested that phenotypic integration (i.e. the pattern and magnitude of functional
correlation among different plant traits, Pigliucci 2003), may play a role in constraining phenotypic plasticity (Gianoli 2004; Valladares et al. 2007; Gianoli and Palacio-López 2009). An
integrated phenotype may have an important advantage in the invasion process because it
can respond to environmental variation more efficiently, producing a more adaptive
response to the environment than less integrated phenotypes (Schlichting 1989; Gianoli 2004). Consequently, plants with a more integrated phenotype should
be less plastic than plants that show lower number of correlations among their traits
(Valladares et al.
2007; Gianoli and Palacio-López
2009). However, phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic integration can both
favour plant fitness (Godoy et
al. 2012). Further research is thus necessary to elucidate the
direction of phenotypic change in invasive species for a better understanding of how
ecological traits are inﬂuenced by new environmental conditions (Flores-Moreno et al.
2015).

A genus of trees that has been widely planted outside its native range is
Casuarina (Casuarinaceae) (Potgieter et al. 2014a). Casuarinas differ
from other well-studied invasive trees (e.g. Australian acacias,
Eucalyptus spp. and Pinus spp.; Kueffer et al. 2013) in that
they invade a distinctive set of habitats (e.g. beach crests, rock coasts, young
volcanic ﬂows, riparian ecosystems) and their requirements for successful invasion
differ from those of other tree taxa (Morton
1980; Potgieter et al.
2014a, c). This genus provides a useful model for understanding
how interactions between ecological factors and species traits mediate naturalization
and other stages along the introduction–naturalization–invasion continuum
(Potgieter et al.
2014a). Casuarina equisetifolia L. is the
most widely planted species in the genus and is one of the most invasive alien tree
species in the world (Rejmánek and
Richardson 2013, Potgieter et
al. 2014a); it invades mainly coastal regions
(Wheeler et al. 2011).
In Brazil, the species was introduced along the entire coast, especially in sandy
coastal plains (I3N Brazil 2015). The
species is widely naturalized, but it is not yet invasive in this country (Zenni and Ziller 2011; Potgieter et al. 2014a).
Given the large extent of climatically suitable areas for C.
equisetifolia in Brazil, including many areas with substantial plantings
(high propagule pressure), further naturalizations and invasions of this species are
likely in the future (Potgieter et
al. 2014a).

Sandy coastal plain ecosystems are characterized by multiple stressful conditions (e.g.
high solar radiation, drought, nutrient-poor sandy substrate, high temperatures and
salinity, Reinert et al.
1997; Hesp and Martínez
2007). These factors have the potential to limit germination, survival and
growth of plants (Maun 1994; Scarano 2009). Communities of sandy coastal
plains called ‘restinga’ (sensu
Araújo 1992) occupy 79 % of
the Brazilian coast (5.820 km), extending from the Equator to below the Tropic of
Capricorn—a distance of ∼3.900 km (67 % in the tropics; Lacerda et al. 1993). The
restingas occur on sandy soils and have several formations which vary in species
composition and vegetation structure, due to varying abiotic conditions (Lacerda et al. 1993). Some
restingas have a patchy structure and are classified as open scrub vegetation. In many
parts of the world, extensive areas of sandy coastal plains are covered by open scrub
vegetation that may occur behind the coastal thicket or farther inland (Araújo and Pereira 2002). This
vegetation provides a spatial heterogeneity of resources, resulting in two distinct
microsites: vegetation patches and open areas (Araújo and Pereira 2002) [see Supporting Information—Fig. S1]. Woody
species (up to 5 m high) dominate and vines are also common components of the
vegetation patches (Araújo and Pereira
2002, Araújo et
al. 2009). Inside the patches, environmental conditions may be
less harsh than in open areas due to higher water supply and lower solar irradiation
(Gómez-Aparicio et al.
2005). Nevertheless, shade beneath patch canopies can limit plant growth by
reducing photosynthesis (Callaway and Walker
1997; Hastwell and Facelli
2003). The two distinct environmental conditions found in the restinga (high
irradiance and low water (open area) versus low irradiance and high water (patches)
(Matos 2014)) allow for the evaluation
of the combined effects of shade and drought in the naturalization process.

The restinga ecosystems are associated with the Brazilian Atlantic Forest domain which
is highly degraded; only 11.7 % of the original vegetation remains, which 0.5
% comprises remaining restingas and mangroves (Ribeiro et al. 2009).The restinga is highly
degraded (Araújo and Pereira 2002;
Rocha et al. 2007)
mainly as a result of vegetation removal for housing development, the collection of
plants for sale and the establishment of alien plant species such as C.
equisetifolia (Rocha
et al. 2007). Despite its high invasive potential and its
increasing biological and economic impacts on sandy coastal plains in many parts of the
world (Potgieter et al.
2014a), relatively little is known about the
ecophysiological traits that favour C. equisetifolia invasiveness.
Thus, analysis of seed persistence in the soil, germination behaviour and plant growth
performance in response to different environmental factors could allow a better
understanding of the factors that make C. equisetifolia one of the most
widespread invasive trees in coastal regions of the world (Rejmánek and Richardson 2013; Potgieter et al.
2014a).

The main objective of the study was to identify the sets of traits that enable
C. equisetifolia to overcome the survival and reproductive barriers
(Blackburn et al. 2011)
and to become naturalized in the restinga. The hypotheses were: (i) C.
equisetifolia forms a persistent soil seed bank that favours invasion; (ii)
given the wide climatic amplitude in its native range (Whistler and Elevitch 2006; Potgieter et al. 2014a),
C. equisetifolia seeds can germinate across a broad range of
temperatures; (iii) because the species is shade-sensitive and mostly found near water
bodies (U.S. National Research Council
1984; Parrotta 1993), drought
and shade should reduce its germination, survival and growth; (iv) C.
equisetifolia should display a low trait plasticity and (v) phenotypic
plasticity and phenotypic integration of traits are inversely related in this species
(Gianoli 2004; Gianoli and Palacio-López 2009). A better
understanding of the traits and the environmental factors that facilitate its
naturalization will help to elucidate the magnitude of the invasion debt
(sensu
Rouget et al. 2016) for
this species in many parts of the world where it has been planted but where invasions
have not yet manifested. This study will improve our knowledge about how key stressors
(high temperature, solar radiation, drought and salinity) can limit the initial
establishment of an alien species and the transition of a population from casual to
naturalized. Further, understanding why and under which circumstances species become
naturalized may facilitate the prediction of future invasions, determine the best ways
to control invasive species, and elucidate the impact of invasive species on native
communities (Pyšek and Richardson
2007; Richardson and Pyšek
2012).

Methods
Study species
Casuarina equisetifolia (Australian pine or coastal she-oak) is an
evergreen, fast-growing tree that attains a height of 10–40 m. The species
has the largest natural distribution in the genus and is native to the east coast of
Australia and Southeast Asia (Parrotta
1993). Reproduction is mainly by seeds (Morton 1980; Apfelbaum et al. 1983), but it can also propagate
vegetatively (Rentería 2007).
Dispersal is mainly by wind (Morton
1980), but also by water (Rentería 2007) and birds (Ferriter et al. 2007). The species tolerates saline
conditions and low soil fertility (Morton
1980). Symbiotic associations with N-fixing actinomycete in the genus
Frankia as well as ecto-, endo- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
allow C. equisetifolia to grow on nutrient-poor substrates (Zhong et al. 1995, Diagne et al. 2013). It
has been planted in coastal regions in many parts of the world, mainly to stabilize
dunes and for windbreaks (Morton 1980;
Parrotta 1993). Casuarina
equisetifolia has the capacity to invade open areas in the dunes and
replace the native vegetation, threatening biodiversity in coastal regions (Wheeler et al. 2011).
Further, it produces large amounts of litter, which can limit the establishment of
native plants (Hata et al.
2010). The species is naturalized in at least 32 countries and it has
become invasive in 10 geographical regions, including North America (Florida),
Central America, South America, Asia, the Middle East, southern Africa and on many
islands (Pacific, Indian Ocean, Atlantic and Caribbean Islands) (Rejmánek and Richardson 2013; Potgieter et al.
2014a). In Brazil, it was introduced and disseminated
mainly after 1950, especially in the restingas of southern, southeastern and
northeastern Brazil (I3N Brazil 2015).
There are no records of the species being invasive in Brazil, although it is widely
naturalized (Zenni and Ziller 2011;
Potgieter et al.
2014a).

Study area
The study was conducted in a naturalized population of C.
equisetifolia (sea level, 22° 58′S, 42° 01′W) in the
restinga of the State Park of Costa do Sol, in the municipality of Arraial do Cabo,
State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Fig. 1).
This is one of the largest Casuarina stands (2.2 ha) in the
park, and has 0.31 individuals m − 2
(3.048 ind ha − 1), average
height of 7.27 ± 3.86 m and diameter at breast height of
5.77 ± 5.18 cm
(n = 450). In the state of Rio de Janeiro, at
least 42 % of restingas are degraded (Rocha et al. 2007), but this percentage is now probably
substantially higher as disturbance in this ecosystem has increased markedly in
recent years (Cosendey et al.
2016). The remaining restingas comprise fragments, mostly of small size,
with few areas occurring within official Conservation Units (Rocha et al. 2007). One of the restingas
with the most critical situations in terms of degradation is in the State Park of
Costa do Sol (Rocha et al.
2007). This restinga is located between the Atlantic Ocean and the Araruama
lagoon, the largest hypersaline lagoon in the world. This region is characterized by
a hot, semiarid climate, with 800 mm of annual precipitation occurring
predominantly during the summer (November to February) (Barbiére 1984). The mean annual temperature is 25
°C, with minimum and maximum temperatures of 12 and 36 °C, respectively
(Scarano 2002). Figure 1. Study area (sea level, 22° 58′S, 42° 01′W) in the
restinga of the State Park of Costa do Sol, in the municipality of Arraial
do Cabo, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.




Seed collection
Approximately 8000 seeds of C. equisetifolia were randomly collected
from 20 trees, sampled with a minimal distance of 10 m from each other in August
2012. Mature seeds from opened dry dehiscent fruits were dried (18 °C; 18
% relative humidity) for 3–5 days, and hermetically stored in
sealed plastic bags at − 20 °C (Bonner 2008).

Seed longevity in the soil
To evaluate the longevity of C. equisetifolia seeds in the soil, the
seeds were packed in nylon mesh bags with sterilized (autoclaved at 121 °C for
0.5 h) sandy soil collected in the restinga (open area). Seventy bags (40 seeds
per bag) were buried at a depth of 5 cm in the same area as the seeds were
collected. Groups of 10 bags were dug up after 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months
and the viability of the seeds buried in the soil was evaluated in a laboratory by
germination tests. To test the effect of the light in germination of buried seeds,
germination tests were carried out under light (photoperiod of 8/16 h) and dark
conditions. To compare the viability of the seeds
(n = 2800) buried in the soil with optimal
storage conditions, ∼1500 seeds were stored at −18 °C (control group)
over the same period that they were buried. Seed germination tests of the control
group were carried out under light conditions. Seeds were germinated in Petri dishes
(9 cm diameter), lined with two filter paper discs, moistened with 5 mL of
distilled water. The germination tests had a randomized design, with five replicates
of 40 seeds; the seeds in each bag constituted a replication.

Seed traits and germination tests
Dry weight and moisture content of the seeds (five replicates of five seeds) were
determined according to the low-constant-temperature-oven method (103
°C/17 h; ISTA 1999). Length
and width were measured with a digital calliper for 50 samaras (whole winged fruit,
including the seed).

Germination tests were carried out to evaluate the effects of temperature,
red/far-red light ratio (R:FR), water and salt stresses. The seeds were germinated in
Petri dishes (9 cm diameter) lined with two filter paper discs, moistened with
5 mL of distilled water or specific osmotic solutions (sodium chloride (NaCl) or
polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000)). The temperature of the germination chamber was
determined by the temperature experiment. Unless light was an intended variable, a
regime of 8 h light/16 h darkness was applied (4×20 W white
ﬂuorescent lamps; total ﬂux rate of
90 µmol/m2/s).

The temperature experiment was represented by constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25,
30, 35 and 40 °C (± 1.0 °C) and by alternating regimes of
25/20, 30/20, 35/20 and 40/20 °C (8/16 h, respectively; the alternating
temperature treatment was 8 h in the light at the higher temperature and
16 h in the dark at the lower temperature). In the temperatures of 25, 30 and
30/20 °C the germination was also evaluated in the dark, and the Petri dishes
were wrapped in two aluminium foils. The optimal germination temperature was used in
light, water and saline stresses experiments.

The light experiment included six R:FR irradiance treatments: 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8
and 1.0. Zero irradiance treatment was produced by wrapping the Petri dishes in two
aluminium foils. The greatest R:FR treatment (1.0) was obtained by leaving the Petri
dishes free of filters. Spectrum was provided by two ﬂuorescent 22 W white
lamps and one incandescent 15 W lamps, totalling 1.0 R:FR, which is close to the
1.19 R:FR of full sunlight (Smith
2000). The four remaining R:FR irradiance treatments were achieved by wrapping
the Petri dishes with different colours of LEE filters. The R:FR irradiance was
measured with sensors SKR 110 and SKP 215, coupled to SpectroSense (Skye Instruments
Inc.).

The effect of water and salt stresses in the germination was tested with PEG 8000 and
NaCl solutions, respectively. The osmotic potentials used were: 0.0, −0.25,
−0.5, −0.75, −1.0, −1.25 and −1.5 MPa. These
different potentials were found in the restinga (Martins et al. 2012). PEG 8000 and NaCl
solutions were prepared according to Villela
and Beckert (2001) and Salisbury and
Ross (1992), respectively. To minimize water potential variation, seeds
were transferred to a new Petri dish with the solution every 7 days. After
30 days, in a recovery treatment, the ungerminated seeds from PEG 8000 and NaCl
solutions were washed with distilled water. The seeds were then transferred to Petri
dishes with distilled water to evaluate the germination potential.

In all experiments, the positions of Petri dishes inside germination chambers were
randomly changed every day. A seed was considered to have germinated when its radicle
emerged to a length of 1 mm. Germination was recorded daily for 30 days,
and germinated seeds were removed from Petri dishes. In the light experiment, the
germination was evaluated in a dark and closed room, with a green safelight. Five
replicates of 40 seeds were used in all experiments. Seeds that did not germinate
were subjected to the application of pressure with tweezers, and were either empty or
had been colonized by fungi.

Survival and growth
To minimize genetic variation, all seeds used in this experiment came from a single
tree, so the seedlings were half-siblings. Seeds were germinated in germination
chambers (30 °C; 8 h photoperiod) and after 2 months, seedlings were
transplanted to individual plastic bags (2L) and transferred to the greenhouse of the
Rio de Janeiro Botanic Garden. Soil substrate consisted of 1:1:1 volume homogenized
mixture of soil of the area with C. equisetifolia invasion, sand
collected inside the patches and bare sand. This mixture was used to provide a
substrate with macro and micronutrients found in the restinga.

After 4 months, the height and stem diameter of the young plants of C.
equisetifolia were measured. These plants were submitted to a factorial
experiment to simulate the light intensity and water availability found in three
microsites of the restinga (inside vegetation patches, edge and open area) and in the
C. equisetifolia stands. This experiment had eight treatments,
with four light levels and two watering regimes. The plants were separated in eight
groups and there were no significant differences in initial height of the individuals
between groups (P < 0.05). Distinct conditions of
light were established with shade cages of wood
(1 m×1 m×1 m), covered with cloth layers of different
colours and thicknesses. The photosynthetic photon-flux density (PPFD%) and
R:FR (mol mol − 1) inside each shade
cage were: ∼2 %,
0.29 mol mol − 1 (inside
vegetation patches); ∼15 %,
0.48 mol mol − 1 (edge);
∼70 %,
1.05 mol mol − 1 (C.
equisetifolia stand) and ∼100 %,
1.12 mol mol − 1 (open area).
At each light intensity, half of the young plants were grown under high water (>10
% of soil water content) and other half at low water conditions (<2
% of soil water content). Soil water content was monitored weekly from four
soil samples per treatment, and was determined by gravimetric method (24 h/103
°C). The soil was irrigated once or twice a week by applying 30 (2 %, low
water) to 150 ml (100 %, high water) of water.

The values of PPFD%, R:FR and watering regimes inside patches, edge and open
area in the restinga were obtained by Matos
(2014). Data of PPFD% and R:FR of C. equisetifolia
stands were measured at 20 random points (68.5 ± 11.2 %
PPFD%,
1.05 ± 0.10 µmol m − 2 s − 1).
The values of PPFD% were calculated taking as reference the mean full sunlight
(100 % PPFD = 2305.3 µmol
m − 2
s − 1). All measurements were made at
midday, on sunny cloud-free days, with a radiometer SKR-100 linked to a SpectroSense
2 SKL 904 (Skye Instruments, Llandrindod Wells, UK). To minimize experimental error
due to light variability inside the shade cages, positions of the young plants were
rotated once a week. For survival analysis, 15 individuals per treatment were
monitored weekly, for 16 weeks. Plants that lost all their aerial structure and
did not have any photosynthetic active leaf were recorded as dead.

At the end of the experiment, samples of all young plants that survived were
harvested to measure stem length, main root length and collar diameter. Thereafter,
they were separated into leaves stems and roots, and each fraction was dried (80
°C/48 h) and weighted. Total dry mass (TDM), Leaf mass fraction
(LMF = leaf dry mass/plant dry mass), stem mass fraction
(SMF = stem dry mass/plant dry mass), root mass fraction
(RMF = root dry mass/plant dry mass), shoot: root ratio
(RS = shoot dry mass/root dry mass), slenderness index
(SI = stem height/collar diameter), specific stem length
(SSL = stem length/stem dry mass), specific root length
(SRL = root length/root dry mass), total leaf mass (TLM), total
leaf area (TLA), specific leaf area (SLA = leaf area/total leaf
mass) and leaf area ratio (LAR = leaf area/total plant dry
mass). Leaf area and SLA were calculated following the protocol proposed by Gómez-Aparicio et al.
(2006) for pines needles. Relative growth rates were calculated for total
biomass (RGRb) and total leaf area (RGRa) using the pairing method (Evans 1972). RGR was calculated as
RGR = (lnx2−lnx1)/(t2−t1),
where x1is the trait measured in time 1 (t1) and
x2 is the trait measured in time 2
(t2).

Phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic integration
Phenotypic plasticity in response to light for each trait was calculated as the
relative distance plasticity index
(RDPI = ∑(dij → i′j′/(xi′j′ + xij))/n),
where n is the total number of distances, and j and
j′ are two individuals belonging to different treatments
(i and i′). This index ranges from 0 (no
plasticity) to 1 (maximal plasticity). Overall RDPI was calculated by summing all
relative distances obtained and dividing by the total number of distances (Valladares et al. 2006).
It was not possible to calculate RDPI in relation to water regime because almost all
young plants died under low water conditions.

Phenotypic integration was estimated as the number of significant correlations
(P < 0.05; Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient) with the other traits (pairwise comparison) for 15 % of light
(shady condition) and 100 % of light (sunny condition) (Gianoli and Palacio-López 2009). Phenotypic
integration index in each light condition was calculated based on the variance of the
eigenvalues of the correlation matrix between phenotypic traits (Wagner 1984).

Data analysis
In the experiments to determine seed longevity in the soil and the effect of
temperature, PEG 8000 and NaCl solutions, germination was evaluated by germination
percentage and germination rate
(v = Σni/(Σni·ti)); where
‘ni’ is the number of seeds germinated per day and ‘ti’ is
the incubation time (days) (Labouriau and
Pacheco 1978). In the light experiment only the final germination
percentage was evaluated.

The longevity of C. equisetifolia seeds in the soil and cold
conditions was analysed through germination percentage and germination rate
parameters by linear regression. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to
compare the slopes of regression lines between the two storage conditions of the
seeds (cold storage X soil storage) and the effect of the light conditions on
germination of the buried seeds in the soil (light X dark). The ANCOVA was used with
germination percentage and germination rate as dependent variables, storage and light
conditions as factors and storage time (1, 3,…, 24 months) as covariate.
The interaction between the conditions and time in the germination process was
evaluated. Homogeneity of slopes was confirmed before conducting each ANCOVA. The
differences in ANCOVA were in relation to the inclination.

The recovery germination percentage in the PEG 8000 and NaCl solutions was calculated
by adding the germination values of each iso-osmotic solution and their respective
germination value after transferal to distilled water. In the experiments of
temperature, PEG 8000 and NaCl solutions data were analysed for normality using the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and for homogeneity of variance using Levene’s
test. For data that did not show normality and/or variance homogeneity, germination
percentage was arcsine √ transformed and germination rate transformed to
log(x + 1) (Zar 1999). Germination percentage and germination rate
were tested in a factorial ANOVA, followed by a post
hoc Tukey’s test (P < 0.05).
In the experiment of light the relationship between germination percentage (y) and
R:FR (x) was determined using a logistic function (Pearson et al. 2003) and
described by the following equation:
y = a/{1 + exp
[−((x−x0)/b)]},
where a is a coefficient describing the maximum germination
percentage, x0 is a coefficient estimating the R:FR at 50
% of maximum germination and b is a coefficient of the slope
of the germination response calculated from estimates of R:FR.

For survival analysis the Kaplan–Meier product limit method was used to
estimate the survival function, and the log-rank test was used to assess for
significant differences in survival curves among treatments. Cox regression was used
to evaluate the effects of light, water and their interactions on probability of the
death of young plants.

Growth analyses were performed only in treatments of 15, 70 and 100 % of light
under high water conditions due to high mortality rates under low water conditions
and in deep shade (2 %). To test the effect of light for all morphological and
biomass allocation traits together Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was
used. Traits that showed a significant effect in the MANOVA results were tested
separately by one-way ANOVA, followed by a post hoc Tukey’s
test (P < 0.05). Before the analyses, normality of
the data was tested by Shapiro–Wilk’s W test and
homoscedasticity by Levene’s test. To check the homogeneity of covariance
matrices Box M test and the Bartlet’s test was used to check for sphericity.
Where necessary, data were ln-transformed to correct for deviations from these
assumptions. Differences in RGR were submitted to a one-way ANOVA, using
Tukey’s post hoc test
(P < 0.05). To minimize the influence of outliers
and reduce the within-harvest-variation, prior to growth analysis data were trimmed
by the removing the smallest and the largest plant from each treatment (Barnett and Lewis 1978).

Regression analysis was used to determine whether phenotypic plasticity in response
to light (dependent variable) and phenotypic integration of traits in shady and sunny
conditions (independent variable) are inversely related in C.
equisetifolia. Values of RDPI were log-transformed before analysis
[log(x + 1)]. To test the statistical
significance between phenotypic integration indices across light conditions, 95
% confidence intervals for the overall R obtained in each environment were
calculated by bootstrapping 1000 times (García-Verdugo et al. 2009).

Survival analysis was done using the ‘survival’ package (Therneau 2015) and phenotypic integration
index and percentage of maximum possible integration were calculated using the
‘PHENIX’ package (Torices and
Muñoz-Pajares 2015) in R version 3.0.3 (R Development Core Team 2014). The other analyses were
done in Statistica (version 7.0, Statsoft Inc., Tulsa, OK). Graphical display was
performed with R and Origin (version 8.0, OriginLab, MA, Cary, NC).

Results
Seed longevity in the soil
Casuarina equisetifolia seeds remained viable in the soil for at
least 24 months, germinated under light and under dark (Fig. 2A) and had a predicted seed viability of
51.1 months
(y = 71.53−1.40x).
The interaction between storage condition and storage time was significant for
germination rate (ANCOVA, F = 90.19,
P < 0.001) but not for germination percentage
(ANCOVA, F = 1.18,
P = 0.28). There were no significant
interactions between light conditions and storage time for germination percentage
(ANCOVA, F = 6.72,
P = 0.12) and rate (ANCOVA,
F = 2.89,
P = 0.09) [see Supporting Information—Table S2]. Figure 2. Relationships between storage period (months) and germination percentage (A

Germination percentage decreased over time
(R2 = 0.55,

affected by the storage time
(R2 < 0.001,
P = 0.95). In relation to the two storage
conditions, there was no significant difference in germination percentage (ANCOVA,
F = 1.98,
P = 0.16; Fig. 2C). Nevertheless, germination rate was significantly higher in seeds
stored in the soil than at −18 °C (ANCOVA,
F = 104.34,
P < 0.001; Fig. 2D). For seeds buried in the soil, germination percentage and rate
were significantly higher under light than under dark conditions (ANCOVA,

F = 55.08,
P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 2A and B) [see Supporting Information—Table S2].

Seed traits and germination tests
Casuarina equisetifolia samaras had a dry weight of
0.75 ± 0.12 mg, moisture content of
10.8 ± 1.7 %, length of
5.9 ± 0.5 mm and width of
3.1 ± 0.3 mm. Under light, there were no significant
differences in relation to constant and alternating temperature regimes, except for
the constant temperature of 40 °C, which completely inhibited germination. The
conditions that promoted the highest values of germination rates were 30 and 35
°C (Fig. 3). Thus, 30 °C was
chosen as optimal germination temperature for C. equisetifolia and
was used in the other germination experiments. Germination percentage at 25 and 30
°C was significantly reduced under dark compared to the light conditions (Table 1). Nevertheless, an alternating
temperature of 30/20 °C did not have significant differences between the two
regimes of light. The absence of luminosity reduced germination rate at all
temperatures. Figure 3. Seed germination (mean ± SD) of Casuarina
equisetifolia at constant and alternating temperatures.

Casuarina equisetifolia seeds responded significantly to the
treatments involving exposure to the various R:FR ratios (Fig. 4). Seeds were considered neutral photoblastic and
showed higher germination percentages in light than in dark conditions. Seed
germination increased slightly up to the higher R:FR, as indicated by the good fit to
the data (R2 = 0.981;
P < 0.01) provided by the regression analysis.
Germination was also sensitive to water and salt stresses, but the decrease in
germination percentage and rate was higher in PEG 8000 than in NaCl solution (Table 2). Significant decreases in
germination percentages were observed from the water and salt potential of −0.5
and −0.75 MPa, respectively. In both osmotic solutions germination was
null from −1.0 MPa. Germination rate dropped as water and salt potentials
decreased. After the seeds were transferred to distilled water (recovery treatment),
total germination percentage in all treatments showed no significant differences from
the control (Table 2). Figure 4. Effect of red/far-red light (R:FR) ratios on mean final germination

Survival and growth
Survival rates of the young plants had a different response to the combined effect of
light and water stress (Fig. 5). Survival
was improved under high water conditions [see Supporting Information—Fig.
S3A] and the probability of death was ∼46 times
higher under low water than under high water conditions (Hazard
Ratio = 45.97, Wald’s P
value < 0.001). Similarly, 2 % light conditions had a
negative effect on survival rates. Deep shade increased the risk of mortality almost
4 times (Hazard Ratio = 3.70, Wald’s P
value = 0.03). There were no significant differences between
survival rates at 15, 70 and 100 % of light [see
Supporting Information—Fig.
S3B]. Under high water regime, survival was
significantly lower at 2 % light, while there were no significant differences
in survival between the light regimes under dry conditions (Fig. 5). The interaction between light and water was
significant (Wald’s P value = 0.008)
because the effect of drought was higher under high light (70 and 100 % of
light) than under low light (2 and 15 % of light) [see
Supporting Information—Fig. S3C and
D]. Figure 5. Survival curves of young plants of Casuarina equisetifolia
(n = 15) under combined effects of
light (2, 15, 70 and 100 %) and water regimes (HW—high water,
LW—low water) over 16 weeks. Survival analysis was performed with
the Kaplan–Meier product limit method. The letter codes indicate
homogeneous groups (log-rank test,
P < 0.05).




Light intensity had a significant effect in all morphological and biomass allocation
traits that were measured (Table 3).
Shade conditions (15 % of light) led to significantly lower values of relative
growth rates in total biomass and total leaf area and root mass fraction. At high
light (70 and 100 % of light), leaf and shoot mass fraction, shoot: root
fraction and slenderness index, were significantly lower than under shade. Young
plants growing under shady conditions had higher values of specific leaf area and
leaf area ratio than plants under sunny conditions. The only trait that differed
significantly between 70 and 100 % light was specific stem length (Table 3). Table 3 Mean ± SD, F and P

Phenotypic plasticity and phenotypic integration
The overall value of RDPI was 0.32. Phenotypic plasticity in response to light
changed in relation to the trait. The value of RDPI ranged between 0.08 (LMF) until
0.59 (SRL) (Fig. 6). Trait plasticity
could be ranked as: SRL > SSL >  TDM
> TLM >  SI > LAR > SR > SLA
> TLA > RMF >  SMF > LMF. Figure 6. Relative Distance Plasticity Index (RDPI) for 12 allocation traits of young

(SRL), specific stem length (SSL), total dry mass (TDM), total leaf mass
(TLM), slenderness index (SI), leaf area ratio (LAR), shoot: root ratio
(SR), specific leaf area (SLA), total leaf area (TLA), root mass fraction
(RMF), stem mass fraction (SMF) and leaf mass fraction (LMF). The RDPI
values range from 0 (no plasticity) to 1 (maximal plasticity).




The phenotypic integration index and 95 % confidence intervals overlap between
light conditions (15
% =  2.78 ± 1.97; 70
% = 2.53 ± 1.83; 100
% = 2.20 ± 1.40). The magnitude of
individual correlations between the traits changed from one environment to another
[see Supporting Information—Table S4]. Phenotypic
plasticity was positively associated with phenotypic integration under shade
(R2 = 0.51,
P = 0.006) (Fig. 7). Under sunny conditions, plasticity and integration
of the traits showed no significant relationship
(R2 = 0.011,
P = 0.74). Figure 7. Regression analysis between Mean Relative distance plasticity index (RDPI)

equisetifolia. Each point in the regression analysis corresponds
to a single trait.




Discussion
Although Casuarina equisetifolia invades mainly coastal regions (Wheeler et al. 2011),
abiotic conditions in the restingas can limit the naturalization of introduced
populations of this species. High temperatures prevent seed germination and low light
affects the survival and growth of young plants. As the impact of drought negatively
affects the performance of both seeds and seedlings, water stress is the main
environmental factor that limits its naturalization in open scrub vegetation, which
covers large areas of sandy coastal plains in many parts of the world (Araújo and Pereira 2002). The different
formations of the restingas along the Brazilian coast have different percentage of cover
and variation in the water availability (Lacerda
et al. 1993). As high light conditions and high water
availability increase its seed germination and young plants survival, C.
equisetifolia naturalization may be favoured in the formations of the
restingas that has mainly open areas near water bodies.

Persistent soil seed bank may favour invasion
Seed longevity under both storage (buried in the soil and cold/dry laboratory)
conditions over 24 months was similar. These results, together with the small
seed mass and the low moisture content at maturity, suggest that its seeds exhibit
long-lived (orthodox) storage behaviour. The capacity to form a persistent soil seed
bank for potentially up to 50 months are likely due to the dry climate and low
rainfall in the restinga of State Park of Costa do Sol (Barbiére 1984); these conditions inhibit seed
deterioration, soil microbial activity and decomposition processes (Cuneo et al. 2010). As
C. equisetifolia seeds can remain viable in the soil for almost
4 years, they may germinate whenever environmental conditions are favourable for
germination (Baskin and Baskin 2014).
All these features increase the overall probability of recruitment and further
naturalization of this species on sandy coastal plains of Brazil.

Seeds can germinate across a broad range of temperatures and light
conditions
Casuarina equisetifolia seeds had a fast physiological response when
in contact with water, and germination started in 3–4 days after water
uptake in optimal germination temperatures (30 and 35 °C). For small-seeded
species, high germination rate is crucial for the recruitment of new individuals,
mainly in environments with water restrictions, as is the case in the restingas
(Martins et al.
2012). The capacity to germinate under a wide range of temperature
conditions, including low (15 °C) and high alternating temperatures (40/20
°C), although with decrease in the germination rate, is also an important factor
for a population to become naturalized in the restinga, where the temperatures can
range from 21 to 31 °C (mean of 25 °C) inside the patches, and from 19 to 44
°C (mean of 30 °C) in open areas (Matos 2014). Nonetheless, the bare sand of the restinga may reach
temperatures as high as 70 °C at the peak of radiation during mid-summer, in
which the recruitment via seeds is restricted to a few species (Scarano 2002). In relation to the light conditions, small
seeds of some species often require light for germination (Milberg et al. 2000), however, C.
equisetifolia seeds are negatively photoblastic, and darkness only
partially prevents its germination, although it depends on the interaction of the
light with the temperature (Baskin and Baskin
2014).

The high germination percentage of C. equisetifolia seeds across a
wide range of temperature and light conditions was evidence of its robustness (i.e.
the constant expression of a particular phenotype despite genotypic and environmental
variation; Waddington 1942). This
increases its capacity to become naturalized in a high heterogeneous environment of
temperature and light conditions, such as the restinga (Scarano 2002; Matos
2014). In addition, germination rate increased in response to favourable
conditions of temperature and water availability, indicating that this species
displays germination plasticity. A potential advantage of germination plasticity is
the opportunistic germination response to favourable environmental conditions (Richards et al. 2006).
Germination plasticity may have adaptive value if it enables a species to establish
in variable environments where resource levels ﬂuctuate (Wainwright and Cleland 2013), as occurs in the restingas
(Matos 2014). Both robustness of
germination to a range of conditions and plastic fitness response to the environment
may enhance the ability of alien species to invade new ecosystems (Richards et al. 2006;
Wainwright and Cleland 2013).

Salinity and drought reduce seed germination
Salinity and drought tolerance are also two important environmental determinants for
plant recruitment on sandy coastal plains (Martins et al. 2012; Lai et al. 2015). Although C.
equisetifolia colonizes extensive sandy areas (Morton 1980), its germinability (percentage and rate) was
very sensitive to both salt and water stresses. Germination sensitivity to salt
stress has been reported previously for this species (Tani and Sasakawa 2003) and for other 10
Casuarina species (Clemens
et al. 1983). The germination pattern of this species
is typical of halophyte species (sensu
Woodell 1985), where seeds retain
viability under saline soils and germinate in favourable conditions (e.g. after a
rainy period, when the salt is leached from the substrate). In addition to halophyte
seed behaviour, C. equisetifolia seedlings show salt stress
tolerance related to physiological and biochemical mechanisms (Clemens et al. 1983; Tani and Sasakawa 2003). Therefore, the
halophyte behaviour allows C. equisetifolia seeds to become
quiescent in response to salt–water stresses and ensure a fast and high
germination when these limiting factors are overcome. This may be another important
adaptive strategy for C. equisetifolia to become naturalized in the
restingas.

Drought and shade reduce survival and growth of young plants
Young plants showed lower tolerance to shade and water stress than seed germination.
Although its seeds have the capacity to germinate in environments with low levels of
light, young plants are shade-intolerant and will not survive. Thus, even if
C. equisetifolia seeds germinate inside vegetation patches,
seedlings will not establish (T.G. Zimmermann et al. unpubl. data).
In areas with high availability of water, young plants of C.
equisetifolia can survive in a broad range of light conditions, except
under deep shade (< 2 % of light), a condition that is often found
inside vegetation patches (Matos 2014).
Mainly in the restinga, tolerance of high light intensities may enhance plant
survival. As for germination, water availability is crucial for the survival of young
plants of C. equisetifolia. This species can tolerate dry climates
only if the roots can grow down to the water table (Whistler and Elevitch 2006). Therefore, this tree has the
capacity to become naturalized mainly in areas adjacent to watercourses. As in
C. equisetifolia, distance to water bodies was also one of the
main determinants of naturalization of C. cunninghamiana in South
Africa (Potgieter et al.
2014b).

In contrast to C. equisetifolia, shaded microsites beneath the
canopy in vegetation patches is the most favourable niche for regeneration for many
restinga species (Matos 2014). As
ﬂuctuation in resource availability is a key factor controlling invasibility
(Davis et al.
2000), alien species will be more successful at invading communities if they
do not encounter intense competition from resident species for available resources
such as light. Therefore, following a disturbance, a light increment followed by a
rainy event will increase the susceptibility of the restinga to the invasion of
C. equisetifolia.

Casuarina equisetifolia showed differences in growth rate and
biomass allocation in response to changes in light intensity. Although plant survival
was high at 15 % light levels under high water conditions, shading decreased
growth and the young plants exhibited shade avoidance responses, such as high shoot:
root ratio, slenderness index, stem mass fraction and specific stem length (Ryser and Eek 2000). Under high water,
C. equisetifolia exhibits similar growth between conditions of
100 % of light and in the Casuarina stand (70 % of
light), which improves its potential to become naturalized in open areas. In attempt
to minimize evaporative demand (Bloor and
Grubb 2004), C. equisetifolia showed changes in leaf
morphological traits under high light conditions, which results in lower specific
leaf area and leaf area ratio. This adaptation is important for an alien species to
become naturalized in habitats with low water availability, such as the restinga. In
addition, specific leaf area is a plant trait that has shown to be associated with
invasive success across a broad range of species (van Kleunen et al. 2010; Leishman et al.
2014).

Low phenotypic plasticity and high phenotypic integration of traits
Although C. equisetifolia showed germination plasticity, young
plants exhibited low morphological plasticity in response to light. Low phenotypic
plasticity has also been reported in other invasive species in habitats with multiple
stress factors, such as in Acacia longifolia in Mediterranean dunes
(Peperkorn et al.
2005), indicating that morphological plasticity may be advantageous in
favourable environments, whereas stability is more beneficial under adverse
conditions (e.g. Valladares et
al. 2000, 2007).

Several studies have shown that phenotypic integration tends to increase with
environmental stress, and the higher levels of integration observed in these habitats
should constrain the plastic responses of plants (Gianoli 2004; García-Verdugo et al. 2009; Gianoli and Palacio-López 2009). Nevertheless, in
the stressful environment (shade) occurred a positive effect of phenotypic
integration on the plastic expression of C. equisetifolia
morphological traits. As long as environmental conditions ameliorate it is likely
that this alien species does not need to coordinate the phenotype to exhibit
plasticity. Therefore, phenotypic integration may not constrain phenotypic plasticity
of plants in adverse conditions. The values of phenotypic integration index for
C. equisetifolia was similar between shady (2.20) and sunny
(2.78) conditions, even though the magnitude of individual correlations often changed
from one environment to another. These values may be considered high, since studies
showed that ranges from 0.77 to 1.63 (Waitt
and Levin 1993; Boucher et
al. 2013). A high degree of phenotypic integration may thus be
a facilitator of adaptation, because it can reduce maladaptive variation (Armbruster et al. 2014),
which is an important factor in the evolutionary ecology of this species. This
appears to be an important strategy for an alien species to become naturalized in
environments with multiple stress conditions. Nonetheless, the role of phenotypic
integration in invasiveness remains poorly understood (Godoy et al. 2012), and more work is
needed to elucidate the function of the trait correlations along the
naturalization–invasion continuum.

The large production of small seeds (Apfelbaum
et al. 1983), associated with anemochory and hydrochory
dispersal syndromes (Morton 1980, Rentería 2007, Wheeler et al. 2011), the
long-term persistence of seeds in the soil, high germination, survival and growth
under high light, higher efficiency in allocating biomass on structures for water
absorption (low shoot: root ratio) and light-capturing (high leaf mass fraction),
together with the low phenotypic plasticity and high phenotypic integration, are
crucial factors that allow C. equisetifolia to overcome barriers to
reproduction and survival and to become naturalized on sandy coastal plains. These
traits, coupled with the salt tolerance and symbiotic associations (Zhong et al. 1995, Diagne et al. 2013)
enable this species to invade mainly open, sandy habitat, adjacent to watercourses,
especially along coastlines, where disturbances have occurred.

Management strategies
To limit further naturalization of C. equisetifolia and to prevent
it from becoming invasive in the restingas planting of the species should be avoided,
especially in open areas near water bodies. Removal of C.
equisetifolia is difficult, because of its capacity for vigorous regrowth
(Morton 1980), and seeds can remain
viable in the soil for almost 4 years. Thus, we recommend the periodic removal
of cones and seeds especially at the edge of the Casuarina stands,
to prevent recruitment and further invasion in the restinga. As C.
equisetifolia does not tolerate shade and drought and invades mainly
degraded areas, one of the best ways of hampering its naturalization in the restinga
is to conserve the remaining fragments. Therefore, habitat disturbance should be
minimized to reduce opportunities for the colonization of this species. Where
habitats are disturbed, immediate replanting with native vegetation is required.
Nevertheless, restingas have been severely threatened mainly by anthropogenic
disturbances which altering the key processes that naturally make restingas resistant
to C. equisetifolia invasion. Further degradation is sure to lead to
the status of this species changing from naturalized to invasive in large areas in
Brazil.

Conclusions
The long-term persistence of seeds in the soil, the capacity to germinate across a wide
range of temperature and light conditions and the high survival rate of the young plants
in conditions with moderate and high irradiance with high soil moisture are key factors
that favour the naturalization of C. equisetifolia. Thus, areas in the
restingas and on sandy coastal plains that present high-light conditions and are near
water bodies are prone to naturalization of the introduced population of this species.
As young plants showed lower tolerance to shade and water stress than seed germination,
even if the seeds can germinate, young plants will not survive under low light (e.g.
vegetation patches). Although this species exhibited high germination plasticity, young
plants showed low phenotypic plasticity, which is important in habitats with multiple
stress factors (Valladares et
al. 2000, 2007). The
high phenotypic integration is an important factor in the evolutionary ecology of this
species because can facilitate adaptation, thereby improving the chances of this species
becoming naturalized in environments with harsh conditions. As C.
equisetifolia does not tolerate shade and drought and invades mainly
degraded areas, conservation of the restingas is crucial to limit invasion of this
species.
