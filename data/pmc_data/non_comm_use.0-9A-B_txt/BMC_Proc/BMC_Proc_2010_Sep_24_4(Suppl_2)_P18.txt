The human breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 and human fetal cells (nontransformed cells which retain growth potential in culture) were exposed to the effects of products from two varieties of tomatoes (Proton,Sejk) and broccoli. SK-BR-3 was obtained from the ATTCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA). The fetal cells were obtained prenatally from amniotic fluid sampling; after clinical cytogenetic analysis, further culturing was performed based on approval from the donor mother, for anonymous use in medical research. Products from both tomato varieties and from broccoli decreased cancer cell numbers, after cultivations compared to controls, in accordance with numerous literary data. However, the Proton tomato variety supernatant revealed counter-effects, inhibiting cancer cell growth rates after 48 hr of cultivation by 118% (as the percentage difference of control and experimental growth rates), but stimulated fetal cell growth after 89 hr of cultivation by 80%. Our data does not indicate any of the five levels at which tomato products affect cell growth. Whatever the mechanism, results on the one hand show a well known antiproliferative effect of the products on breast cancer cells, on the other hand warn of tomato stimulatory effects on nontransformed cell growth within a tentative chemoterapeutic anti-cancer mixture.
