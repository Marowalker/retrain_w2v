Mammary ductoscopy is a powerful modality with enormous potential to help improve patient care through enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of patients with breast disease. The ability to see ductal pathology and monitor response to therapy real time has enormous potential to expand our understanding of disease processes. Technological improvements involving optics, scope design, ductal access and interventional ductoscopy becoming feasible will help move this field forward. Historical developments, current applications, personal experience, and future directions will be discussed.
