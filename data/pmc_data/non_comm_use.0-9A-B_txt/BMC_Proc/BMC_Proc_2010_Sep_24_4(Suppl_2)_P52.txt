Cisplatin is an inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) with antineoplastic activity. It’s been an important component of standard treatment regimens for several human malignancies including bladder cancer [1]. Cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition [2]. We have studied the cisplatin induced apoptotic responses of one human urinary bladder cancer cell line 5637. The cytotoxic activity of cisplatin on the survival profiles of 5637 cell line was determined by MTT assay. The survival rates of 5637 cells in the presence of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 μg/ml cisplatin after 72h of exposure were averaged 82.6, 55.4, 18.6, 7.2 and 7.9%, respectively. Treatment with cisplatin markedly decreased the viability of 5637 cells in a dose-dependent manner and a significant correlation was found between cell proliferation and cisplatin concentration (r = 0.964; p < 0.01).
