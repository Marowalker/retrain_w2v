==== Body
The perioperative and long term results of colon and rectal cancer surgery are varying to significant extents. Our working group has analyzed the potential reasons for those variations. Quality depends on the surgeon’s training and on the hospital structures. We have decided on eight points which should be provided by the hospital/surgeon to warrant the optimal quality of treatment [1,2].
