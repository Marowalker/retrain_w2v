Longitudinal analyses of comorbid conditions in women with breast cancer are few.

Methods
Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare data, we included
51 950 women aged ≥66 years with in situ and stage I to IV
breast cancer diagnosed in 1998–2002. We identified the prevalence and incidence
of 34 comorbid conditions in these women, as well as in a matched cohort without cancer
whose rates were standardized to the age and race/ethnicity distribution of the cancer
patients. We also estimated rates of office encounters and diagnostic or testing
procedures during the 12 months before diagnosis.

Results
The prevalence of most conditions at diagnosis was comparable among breast cancer and
noncancer patients. New conditions after diagnosis were more common in breast cancer
patients, and the incidence rates increased with higher stage at diagnosis. Before
diagnosis, women presenting with stage IV disease had 41% [95% confidence
interval (CI) 38% to 43%] fewer physician encounters and 34%
(95% CI 24% to 31%) fewer unique diagnostic tests than women
diagnosed with carcinoma in situ.

Conclusions
Many comorbid conditions are identified as a consequence of the breast cancer
diagnosis. There appears to be an important contribution from a lack of interaction with
the health care system before diagnosis.

==== Body
introduction
Breast cancer is a common disease in women, and its incidence increases with age [1, 2].
Understanding the interplay between breast cancer and comorbid conditions is important
because comorbidities influence decisions about the appropriate course of treatment and are
independent risk factors for survival [3–5]. In addition, comorbidities
may limit patients' eligibility for clinical trials, and consequently, the
generalizability of study results to the overall population [6]. For these reasons, comorbidity burden is a key component of the
diagnosis and treatment process as well as postcancer care.

If higher stage at diagnosis were related to greater comorbidity burden, as might be
hypothesized, it would suggest that comorbidity considerations become more complicated for
women with more advanced-stage breast cancer. Although there is no direct evidence of a
significant reservoir of undiagnosed comorbid conditions that increases with stage, there
are studies showing that more screening procedures and more ambulatory care visits are each
associated with earlier stage at diagnosis [7,
8]. Based on this, it would be reasonable to
surmise that those patients who do not seek care for signs and symptoms of cancer, or who
delay screening, may ignore other health issues as well [9]. Such undiagnosed conditions would be expected to be picked up in
the extensive testing and related evaluations conducted after cancer diagnosis. In the
clinical trial setting, any conditions not identified at diagnosis could complicate the
analysis and interpretation of the trial data. However, despite its relevance to patient
care, the incidence of new comorbid conditions after cancer diagnosis has not, to our
knowledge, been compared across stages, or to a control population of individuals without
cancer.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was threefold: to quantify the comorbidity burden at
the time of diagnosis by comparing the prevalence of a variety of conditions in women with
and without breast cancer; to estimate the previously undetected comorbidity burden elicited
after cancer diagnosis by estimating incidence rates for a variety of conditions in these
women; and to explore whether the identification of comorbid conditions in breast cancer
patients is related to the degree of precancer interaction with the health system in these
women.

methods
data source
This study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare
database, which links SEER cancer registry data with Medicare data. Medicare-eligible
persons are primarily individuals aged ≥65 in the United States, although other younger
populations are included based on disability or specific medical conditions [10–12]. Our dataset also included a separately created 5% random sample of
noncancer patients from the Medicare program in the same catchment areas as those used in
the SEER program for use as a reference (i.e. control) population.

study population and observation period
Patients were diagnosed with in situ and stage I to IV breast cancer
between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 and had Medicare claims available from 1997
through 2005. Women with previous primary cancer diagnoses in the SEER registry were
excluded as were women who died in the month of diagnosis. Follow-up was based on data for
covered health care services, including hospital, physician, and outpatient claims. Cancer
and noncancer subjects were at least 66 years old to allow at least 12 months of Medicare
claims data for identifying prevalent conditions before diagnosis. All patients were
required to have both Part A and B Medicare coverage (i.e. fee-for-service) during the
observation period, and all patients in managed care plans were excluded because detailed
medical claims are not available for these individuals. Follow-up ended at the earliest of
the following events: end of the observation period, end of Part A and B coverage, or
death.

An identically sized cohort of women without cancer (i.e. noncancer patients) was created
by matching on both time of diagnosis and geographic area to the cohort of women with
cancer (other variables were controlled using stratification and adjustment as discussed
below). For time matching, the SEER month and year of cancer diagnosis for each cancer
patient were used to identify potential noncancer matches who had appropriate Medicare
coverage on the same date. The first day of this month was assigned as the diagnosis index
date for both the breast cancer patient and her randomly selected noncancer control. For
geographic area matching, the county of residence was used first and the state of
residence was used if no county match was available. Subjects in the noncancer cohort were
known to be cancer-free through 2002.

patient characteristics
For women with breast cancer, the SEER data were the source for identifying the date of
cancer diagnosis, cancer site, and tumor characteristics. Stage at breast cancer diagnosis
was based on the SEER–Modified American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage
variable [13]. Hormone receptor status
included estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor status (PR). For all patients,
age was given in years at the diagnosis index date. Race/ethnicity was based on the
following categories: white, black, Hispanic, or other (predominately American Indian,
Native Alaskan, Pacific Islander, and Asian).

The algorithm from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for constructing a comorbidity
index was also used for all patients to estimate a modified Charlson Comorbidity Index
incorporating the adaptations suggested by Deyo and Romano (excluding cancer as a
condition) [14–16]. Scores were categorized into 0, 1, and ≥2.

definitions of comorbid conditions
Medicare claims data were used for identifying prevalent and incident conditions of
interest throughout the observation period. Supplemental Appendix Table S1 (available at Annals of
Oncology online) provides the International Classification of Diseases, ninth
edition (ICD-9) codes used to identify the 34 conditions in both breast cancer and
noncancer women [17]. These conditions were
chosen to represent common comorbid conditions in older adults, as well as common
consequences of chemotherapy (referred to as ‘adverse events’). Diagnoses
recorded on claims for inpatient stays were counted at the time of their first occurrence.
Diagnoses in outpatient facility and physician claims were assessed similarly to the NCI
comorbidity algorithm, which requires two diagnoses at least 30 days apart to identify a
comorbidity (taking the first occurrence as the date of onset). For the subgroup of 10
conditions classified as adverse events, only claims associated with an inpatient or
emergency department visit were counted, and, because ‘rule-out’ claims are
less of a problem in the hospital setting, only a single diagnosis code was required. In
this way, they align with the concept of ‘serious adverse events’ often used
in clinical trials, although they may represent chronic conditions and/or be unrelated to
cancer-directed therapy.

counts of physician encounters and diagnostic tests
As a simple approach to measuring interactions with the health system, we counted the
number of physician encounters and the number of unique diagnostic tests carried out in
the breast cancer and noncancer patient cohorts during the 12 months before, and after,
the diagnosis index date. Physician encounters were defined as physician office visits
using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes [18]. Unique diagnostic tests included claims with HCPCS codes for
the following: radiology, pathology and laboratory, psychiatric diagnostics,
gastroenterology diagnostics, echocardiography, intracardiac electrophysiology,
cerebrovascular arterial studies, pulmonary testing, glucose monitoring,
electroencephalography, and central nervous system assessments (see supplemental Appendix Table S2, available at Annals of
Oncology online). One physician encounter per day per patient was counted, and
one of each type of diagnostic test (HCPCS code) per patient was counted.

statistical analyses
For each condition, standardized rates were estimated for each of the three observation
periods (before, 3 months after, and 12 months after the index date). These rates were
estimated overall as well as within age, race/ethnicity, and stage-specific (for cancer
patients) strata (data not shown). The cancer rates for each stratum were standardized to
the age, race/ethnicity, and stage-specific characteristics of the total breast cancer
cohort [19]. Rates in the noncancer patients
were standardized to the age and race/ethnicity distribution of the total breast cancer
cohort to facilitate comparisons.

Prevalence was defined as the proportion of study subjects with a particular condition as
of the index date using claims before the diagnosis index date. Binomial confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated for each prevalence proportion. Incidence rates were
defined as new diagnoses after the index date in patients free of the condition at
diagnosis. If the comorbid condition was not diagnosed, subjects were censored at death,
the end of coverage according to the eligibility criteria, or the end of the observation
period. Incidence rates per 1000 person-years were estimated. The 12-month and 3-month
rates reflect overlapping time periods.

Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to estimate the average number of visits
or tests during the year before the index date by cancer stage at diagnosis in the breast
cancer cohort and to compare the number of visits or tests between cancer and noncancer
patients. These models were adjusted for age and race/ethnicity [20, 21].

All analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Stata
(version 10; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).

results
There were 51 950 women identified in both the breast cancer and the noncancer
populations. See Table 1 for details on the

The standardized prevalence rates for 27 of the 34 conditions were lower in women with
cancer compared with women without cancer (Table 2). Certain comorbidities were exceptions to this pattern: atrial fibrillation,
hypertension, diabetes, liver disease, osteoarthritis, thromboembolic events, and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. In terms of incidence rates for all conditions, standardized
3-month and 12-month rates were, with the exception of the 12-month cardiac arrest rate,
always higher in the women with breast cancer. See Table 3 for incidence rates.Table 2. Prevalence proportions for Comorbid conditions in

When stratified by stage at breast cancer diagnosis, for many comorbid conditions, the
prevalence rates were quite variable (Figure 1
and supplemental Appendix Table S3, available at Annals of
Oncology online). In contrast, the incidence rates for most conditions increased
with higher stage at breast cancer diagnosis (Figure 2 and supplemental Appendix Table S4, available at Annals of
Oncology online).Figure 1 The

Women with and without breast cancer had comparable numbers of physician encounters in the
window of time beginning 12 months before the cancer diagnosis date and ending 4 months
prior, as seen in the unadjusted counts in Figure 3. For women with breast cancer, the counts of both physician encounters and new
diagnostic tests during the 12-month precancer diagnosis period appeared to increase
beginning 3 months before the cancer diagnosis date. Statistical models to estimate counts
and rates in the precancer diagnosis period were consistent with these figures after
adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, as well as accounting for censoring (i.e. losses to
follow-up and death). When we excluded the 3-month pre-diagnosis period from the statistical
models comparing utilization between women with and without breast cancer, most of the
difference in physician encounters and virtually all of the difference in diagnostic testing
were removed (Table 4).Figure 3 The unadjusted number of physician office visits and
unique diagnostic tests before and after the diagnosis index date. Counts in the above
figures do not show losses to follow-up after diagnosis. At 3 months the breast cancer
and noncancer populations were 96% and 98% of the baseline total,
respectively (51 590); at 6 months they were 94% and 96% of
baseline, respectively; and at 12 months they were 90% and 93% of
baseline, respectively.

Analyses of the numbers of physician encounters and unique diagnostic tests by stage showed
that each measure was inversely related to the stage of breast cancer at diagnosis. This
trend was consistent for both the entire 12-month period before diagnosis, as well as the
period excluding the 3-month pre-diagnosis period. In particular, patients presenting with
stage IV disease had 41% (95% CI 38% to 43%) fewer physician
encounters and 34% (95% CI 24% to 31%) fewer unique diagnostic
tests than women diagnosed with carcinoma in situ when ignoring the 3-month
pre-diagnosis period (Table 4).

discussion
This study shows that older women, at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, have a
comparable prevalence of comorbid conditions to women who do not have breast cancer. In
addition, stage at diagnosis is associated with variability in the prevalence of many
conditions, but the pattern of the association is quite heterogeneous. In contrast, the
incidence rates of comorbid conditions, stratified by stage at diagnosis, show that more
advanced cancer stage is associated with a greater likelihood of identifying new comorbid
conditions. Most importantly from a public health perspective, more advanced stage at
diagnosis is also associated with the degree of precancer health system interaction, as
measured by office visits and unique diagnostic tests. Hence, there is evidence for a health
care seeking behavioral component to the undiagnosed comorbidity burden in breast cancer
patients.

Looking more closely, older women with breast cancer tended to have slightly lower
prevalence rates for most comorbid conditions compared with women without cancer, even after
accounting for age, race, time, and geographic area. Some of this is likely to be related to
an under-diagnosis of conditions in women with later-stage disease, a gap that shrinks after
the cancer diagnosis. However, the prevalence of several conditions was higher in women with
breast cancer than in those without, in contrast to the overall pattern. For hypertension,
diabetes, thromboembolic events, and osteoarthritis, there is an established association
with higher body mass index (BMI), a confounder that could not be controlled through
standardization in these data [22–28]. That is, because higher BMI is a risk factor
for breast cancer, our breast cancer population may have been heavier, which may have
increased the prevalence of conditions associated with higher BMI [29, 30]. Similar
reasoning may apply to alcohol consumption and liver disease [31, 32].

There are a variety of conflicting studies evaluating the cross-sectional association
between comorbidity burden and breast cancer stage at diagnosis. Yancik et al. [4] found no association between comorbidity and
breast cancer stage. Fleming et al. [33] found
that the association between comorbid conditions and advanced-stage diagnosis depended on
the comorbid condition. Vaeth et al. [34] found
that women with conditions causing functional limitations were half as likely to be
diagnosed with advanced-stage breast cancer. Gonzalez et al. [35] found that a higher comorbidity index was associated with
higher odds of advanced-stage breast cancer. In addition, similarly conflicting results
exist for other tumors as well [36, 37]. The presence of undiagnosed conditions, many
of which are found after cancer diagnosis, appears to confound associations at the time of
diagnosis.

In addition to our study, others have suggested that interaction with the health system is
a key factor in stage at diagnosis. Gornick et al. [7] showed that the use of preventive services was associated with a lower
likelihood of late-stage diagnosis for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate
cancer. Keating et al. [8] showed that women who
saw a medical provider in the 2 years before diagnosis were significantly less likely to be
diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Furthermore, several studies have evaluated the use
of mammography and have shown that its use is associated with a less-advanced stage at
diagnosis [38, 39]. Our findings add additional evidence to support the idea that
cancer can be identified early if women interact sufficiently, and appropriately, with the
system.

Our findings extend this previous work in several ways. First, in the year before diagnosis
(particularly when ignoring the 3-month pre-diagnosis period), the overall patterns of
medical resource use for women with and without breast cancer were remarkably similar. Based
on this, there does not appear to be any excess utilization in the year immediately
preceding diagnosis. Second, the increase in resource use that occurs around diagnosis
begins as early as 3 months before the month of diagnosis. Hence, the time it takes to
diagnose a woman with breast cancer is variable, occurring over several months. Third, the
rate of newly diagnosed conditions is very high in the 3-month period after the breast
cancer diagnosis. These findings have implications for researchers as well as clinicians,
particularly for researchers studying, or adjusting for, the effect of comorbidity on
outcomes.

Studies of the comorbid conditions identified after breast cancer diagnosis are few.
However, our results are comparable to those from a recent study of comorbid conditions in
1183 breast cancer patients in the Health, Eating, Activity, and Lifestyle Study (HEALS)
[40]. In both HEALS and our study,
hypertension was the most common comorbid condition at the time of diagnosis and also the
most commonly identified new condition after cancer diagnosis. In contrast, our sample had
higher rates of cardiovascular disease, which is not surprising given that our
SEER–Medicare population was notably older. In addition, our study shows that many of
these newly identified conditions appear shortly after diagnosis (within 3 months), and in a
period of time associated with a substantial increase in the use of diagnostic tests and the
initiation of interventions.

There are several key strengths to our analytic approach. The use of a noncancer control
group has not been used in other related studies. Its inclusion is important because while
claims data are limited in their ability to identify all clinically relevant disease, the
control group facilitates internally consistent comparisons. Also, the calculation of both
incidence and prevalence allows us to understand the complete picture of comorbidity around
the time of diagnosis. The large sample size allows for more accurate rate estimation,
particularly for less common conditions. Finally, matching by time and geographic area
allows us to control for temporal trends and geographic variation (as well as socioeconomic
factors to a limited degree), which can be difficult to adjust for, while allowing for
analyses by race, stage, and age (not all of which are shown).

However, the limitations of these analyses also deserve discussion. The SEER–Medicare
merged data lack certain variables (e.g. BMI) that would be useful for comparing women with
and without breast cancer more precisely. In addition, we did not have complete medical
histories for patients, particularly from their pre-Medicare coverage. Also, we were limited
to diagnoses that are included in claims data. While studies have generally confirmed that
claims data are reasonably sensitive and specific, there are limits to the reliability of
claims data for identifying comorbid conditions [41, 42]. It is possible that some of
the newly identified conditions are the result of cancer-directed therapy initiated shortly
after diagnosis and are not previously undiagnosed conditions. On the other hand, the strong
and consistent relationship across conditions between incidence and stage suggests
otherwise, particularly in conditions that should not be related to breast cancer
interventions (e.g. osteoarthritis). Finally, our measures of physician encounters and
unique diagnostic testing are intentionally simplistic, and more sophisticated measures
focusing on specific diagnostic tools and their utilization (as used by others) might
provide improved insights into the nature of the interactions between providers and patients
with respect to cancer diagnosis.

Even with these limitations, this study demonstrates that older women with breast cancer
suffer from a myriad of comorbid conditions that may affect treatment and outcomes. Many of
these are identified as a consequence of the cancer diagnosis. While some may result from
common biological pathways, there is also an important contribution from health-seeking
behavior before the cancer diagnosis. To the extent that this behavior is modifiable,
particularly with screening-friendly reimbursement policies, it may be possible to find both
cancer and comorbid conditions earlier and improve survival.
