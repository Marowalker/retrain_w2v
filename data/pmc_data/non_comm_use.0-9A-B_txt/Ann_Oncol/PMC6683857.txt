Background
Although EGFR mutant tumors exhibit low response rates to immune checkpoint blockade overall, some EGFR mutant tumors do respond to these therapies; however, there is a lack of understanding of the characteristics of EGFR mutant lung tumors responsive to immune checkpoint blockade.

Patients and methods
We retrospectively analyzed de-identified clinical and molecular data on 171 cases of EGFR mutant lung tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors from the Yale Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, University of California Los Angeles, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute. A separate cohort of 383 EGFR mutant lung cancer cases with sequencing data available from the Yale Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and The Cancer Genome Atlas was compiled to assess the relationship between tumor mutation burden and specific EGFR alterations.

Results
Compared with 212 EGFR wild-type lung cancers, outcomes with programmed cell death 1 or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-(L)1) blockade were worse in patients with lung tumors harboring alterations in exon 19 of EGFR (EGFRΔ19) but similar for EGFRL858R lung tumors. EGFRT790M status and PD-L1 expression did not impact response or survival outcomes to immune checkpoint blockade. PD-L1 expression was similar across EGFR alleles. Lung tumors with EGFRΔ19 alterations harbored a lower tumor mutation burden compared with EGFRL858R lung tumors despite similar smoking history.

Conclusions

EGFR mutant tumors have generally low response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, but outcomes vary by allele. Understanding the heterogeneity of EGFR mutant tumors may be informative for establishing the benefits and uses of PD-(L)1 therapies for patients with this disease.

Key Message
The results of this study suggest that EGFR mutant subtypes of non-small-cell lung cancer have distinct response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and distinct tumor mutation burdens. This knowledge may be useful in selecting patients with a higher likelihood of response to immunotherapy.




Introduction
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancers represent a distinct subset of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with broad molecular and clinical heterogeneity. Recurrent alterations in exons 18–21 are commonly observed [1–3] and most, but not all, confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [4–6]. Even the most common EGFR TKI-sensitizing alleles, EGFR L858R (EGFRL858R) and EGFR exon 19 deletions (EGFRΔ19), have differences in outcomes with TKIs [7, 8]. Despite initial responsiveness to EGFR TKIs, acquired resistance is routine [4, 9–11]. The inevitability of resistance has raised hopes of a role for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), with the potential for more durable responses; however, in contrast to preclinical studies [12], clinical evidence suggests that EGFR mutant lung cancers rarely derive benefit from treatment with ICIs [13–16]. Rates of positivity for potential predictors of response to ICIs, such as tumor mutation burden (TMB) and concurrent programed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) plus CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocyte expression, are low [17]. Yet recent studies have emerged, such as ATLANTIC and IMpower150, that have shown more encouraging results for PD-(L)1 blockade in EGFR mutant lung cancers [18, 19].

We hypothesized that the molecularly heterogeneous features of EGFR mutant lung cancers may provide insight into the outcomes with ICIs and improve understanding of the determinants of response in these tumors [20]. To test this, we established a multi-institutional consortium and examined the molecular and clinical features of 171 EGFR mutant lung cancer cases treated with ICIs. A cohort of 212 patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC (previously published) treated with ICIs was used for comparison. Due to limited sequencing data available for ICI-treated EGFR mutant cases in this study, we examined a separate cohort of 383 patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer (irrespective of treatment history) to examine the relationship between TMB and EGFR mutation subtype.

Methods
Cohorts of EGFR mutant lung cancers
Following IRB approval at each respective institution, patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with PD-(L)1 blockade therapy were identified (Yale Cancer Center n = 37, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center n = 67, University of California Los Angeles n = 35, Dana Farber Cancer Institute n = 32). Patients were treated as part of a clinical trial (n = 97; 56.7%) or standard-of-care (n = 74; 43.3%). Due to the retrospective nature of this study, scan intervals were not uniform between all patients. Patients were included who received anti-PD-(L)1 alone or in combination with anti-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4 (anti-CTLA-4), and this treatment was their first exposure to ICIs. In a subset of patients (n=15), ICIs were added to continuation of EGFR TKIs at TKI resistance. In EGFRL858R and EGFRΔ19 cases treated with ICIs before EGFR TKIs, this was due to the absence of information regarding their EGFR alteration at the time of treatment (n = 7), because the patient was enrolled on a specific clinical trial (n = 1) or because the tumor had a baseline EGFRT790M mutation and was treated with anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 therapy (n = 1). TMB was studied in data from a cohort of 383 patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer, irrespective of treatment exposure, collected from three sources: (i) The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 53), (ii) Yale University (n = 17), and (iii) Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (n = 313). TMB was calculated as the total number of non-synonymous mutations divided by the coding region captured for each individual platform (see supplementary Methods, available at Annals of Oncology online).

Results
Distinct EGFR subtypes have different outcomes with immune checkpoint blockade
We investigated the impact of varying EGFR alleles on outcomes with ICIs (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, with or without CTLA-4 blockade) in our cohort of 171 EGFR mutant cases from four institutions (Table 1), focusing particularly on those 126 patients with tumors with the two most common EGFR mutation subtypes [EGFRL858R(n = 46) or EGFRΔ19 (n = 80)] (supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). These cases were evaluated and compared with 212 patients with EGFR wild-type (WT) NSCLC treated with ICIs [21]. EGFRΔ19tumors had a significantly lower overall response rate (ORR) compared with EGFR WT tumors (5 of 76, 7% versus 47 of 212, 22%, respectively, P = 0.002), whereas EGFRL858Rtumors had similar response rates compared with EGFR WT tumors (7 of 44, 16%, versus 47 of 212, 22%, respectively, P = 0.42) (Figure 1A). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly reduced in both EGFRΔ19[(WT versus EGFRΔ19) HR (hazard ratio) 0.449, 95% CI (confidence interval) 0.338–0.595, log-rank P < 0.001] and EGFRL858R[(WT versus EGFRL858R) HR 0.578, 95% CI 0.412–0.811, log-rank P = 0.001] subtypes compared with EGFR WT (Figure 1B). Overall survival (OS) in the EGFRΔ19 group was reduced whereas EGFRL858R tumors had similar OS compared with the EGFR WT subgroup (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.493–0.965, log-rank P = 0.03; HR 0.917, 95% CI 0.597–1.409, log-rank P = 0.69, respectively) (Figure 1C). Overall, these data suggest that patients with EGFRΔ19 mutant tumors, in particular, have a significantly reduced benefit of treatment with ICIs.

Clinicopathologic features associated with outcomes in EGFR mutant lung cancers
We examined the effect of clinical and pathologic features on response to ICIs in patients with EGFRL858Rand EGFRΔ19 mutant lung cancers. ORR, PFS, and OS were all significantly improved in patients who had received 0–2 prior lines of therapy compared with those with 3+ lines of therapy (ORR: 9 of 47, 19%, versus 3 versus 73, 4%, P = 0.01) (PFS: HR 2.267, 95% CI 1.499–3.427, log-rank P < 0.001) (OS: HR 1.845, 95% CI 1.204–2.826, log-rank P = 0.004) (Figure 2A–C). When examined independently, this difference in survival was statistically significant in the EGFRΔ19cohort but not within the EGFRL858Rgroup (supplementary Figure S2A–F, available at Annals of Oncology online). Smoking history was assessed in patients with EGFRL858Rand EGFRΔ19 mutant lung cancers and positively associated with response rate (P = 0.01), but not significantly for PFS or OS outcomes (log-rank P = 0.06, P = 0.23, respectively). Among patients with tumors resistant to EGFR TKIs, the presence or absence of EGFRT790M had no impact on the benefit from treatment with ICIs (Figure 2D–F), irrespective of EGFR allele (supplementary Figure S3, available at Annals of Oncology online).

We also evaluated whether tumor PD-L1 expression was associated with response to ICIs in 73 cases for which staining was available. First, we observed in agreement with published literature [22], that there was no difference in PD-L1 expression by EGFR allele (supplementary Figure S4A, available at Annals of Oncology online). We also noted that PD-L1 expression did not correlate to smoking status in EGFR mutant cases. There was no association between the efficacy of ICIs in tumors with ≥1% or <1% PD-L1 positive staining (ORR: 3 of 23, 13%, versus 4 of 28, 14%, P > 0.99) (PFS: HR 1.370, 95% CI 0.761–2.466, log-rank P = 0.29) (OS: HR 1.747, 95% CI 0.913–3.342, log-rank P = 0.084) in EGFRΔ19and EGFRL858R cases (Figure 2G–I, supplementary Figure S4B, available at Annals of Oncology online), irrespective of EGFR subtype (supplementary Figure S4C–I, available at Annals of Oncology online). In EGFRΔ19and EGFRL858R tumors, we also noted no association between the efficacy of ICIs and PFS or OS in patients with ≥50% (n = 4) or <50% (n = 47) tumor PD-L1 expression, although this comparison was underpowered to make a conclusive association. Due to lack of TMB data in PD-L1 stained cases, we were unable to assess the correlation between TMB and PD-L1 expression, but we acknowledge previous studies in lung cancer showing that PD-L1 expression and TMB are largely uncorrelated [23–25].


EGFRΔ19 mutant lung cancers have a lower tumor mutation burden compared with EGFRL858R mutant lung cancers
Due to the reported association between TMB and response to ICIs, we investigated the TMB across EGFR mutation subtypes in lung cancer [26]. A lack of sequencing data available from our cohort of 171 EGFR mutant tumors treated with immunotherapy led us to compile data from a cohort of 383 sequenced cases of EGFR mutant lung cancer from YCC, MSKCC, and TCGA, irrespective of treatment history (Table 2). Across all EGFR mutation subtypes, the median TMB was 3.8 non-synonymous mutations/megabase (Mb) with a mean TMB of 5.6 non-synonymous mutations/Mb. This is notably less than the median TMB observed in unselected NSCLC cases (7.4 non-synonymous mutations/Mb by MSK-IMPACT) and the TMB cut-off associated with improved outcomes with immunotherapy in NSCLC (10 non-synonymous mutations/Mb) [21, 25, 27]. TMB was significantly lower in EGFRΔ19 tumors compared with EGFRL858R tumors (Figure 3A, supplementary Figure S5, available at Annals of Oncology online). EGFRΔ19mutant tumors had similar TMB compared with EGFR20Ins (P = 0.35) and EGFRL861Q tumors, while the TMB in the EGFRG719 group was higher than in EGFRΔ19tumors (P < 0.001) (Figure 3A).

Figure 3. Characterization of EGFR allele-specific tumor mutation burden (TMB) and smoking history. (A) TMB was calculated for EGFR mutant tumors harboring deletions in exon 19 [(Δ19) (n = 174)], mutations in exon 21 [L858R (n = 117) and L861Q (n = 12)], insertions in exon 20 [(20ins) (n = 21)], mutations in exon 18 [(G719) (n = 21)], or co-mutations at positions G719 and L861Q (n = 1). Data were combined from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Yale Cancer Center, and The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. Data were transformed within each cohort to within-cohort percentile rank to permit unified analysis, and median TMB percentile rank is indicated.

We examined whether smoking history accounted for the differences in TMB in each allele. As expected, there was an association between ever smoking status and higher TMB in all EGFR mutant tumors (data not shown), but this was less evident when interrogating only EGFRL858Rand EGFRΔ19cases (Figure 3B). Smoking status and pack-years were not different based on the specific EGFR allele (Figure 3C and D) suggesting that there is a difference in TMB between the two most common genetic subtypes of EGFR mutant lung cancer that is not simply reflective of differential smoking exposure.

Discussion
Despite the success of EGFR TKIs in EGFR mutant lung cancer, all patients eventually develop acquired resistance to these therapies. ICIs have recently emerged as a therapeutic approach in lung cancer with the potential for durable responses but current data suggest that there is limited efficacy in EGFR-driven cancers [13–16]. For example, the ImmunoTarget group assessed response to ICIs across various molecular subgroups of lung cancer and found that tumors with KRAS, BRAF, or MET exon 14 alterations were more likely to derive benefit than cases with EGFR, ALK, and RET alterations [28, 29, 30]. Yet, some EGFR mutant tumors do respond to ICIs [18, 19]. In this study, we assembled the largest cohort of EGFR mutant cases treated with ICIs to retrospectively interrogate how genetic, molecular, and clinical factors impact response and survival in this subset of lung cancer. Using this multi-institutional collection of patients, we identified allele-specific differences in response to immune checkpoint inhibition. EGFRL858R tumors had a similar response rate and OS outcomes to an EGFR wild-type lung cancer population, while EGFRΔ19cases did substantially worse. Of note, we did observe substantially worse PFS between both EGFRL858Rand EGFRΔ19lung cancer cases compared with EGFR wild-type lung cancer cases. The underlying cause for this discrepancy is unknown, but it may be reflective of the variable scanning intervals represented by this multi-institutional cohort composed of both on-trial and off-trial cases. A recent report evaluating outcomes of 27 patients with EGFR mutant tumors on ICIs found the best ORR in cases with less common EGFR alterations, such as G719X and exon 20 insertions, highlighting potential differences between EGFR alleles [31].

The outcomes on ICIs contrast with those on EGFR TKIs, where EGFRL858Rtumors have a worse durability of response to EGFR TKIs compared with EGFRΔ19 tumors, highlighting the context specificity of genotypic responses to different therapeutic agents [32–34]. One limitation of our study was the lack of sufficient sequencing data to directly compare TMB to response in our cohort of 171 EGFR mutant patients treated with ICI. To address this, we employed a separate cohort of 383 EGFR mutant cases with sequencing data available in which we found that EGFRΔ19 tumors had substantially fewer non-synonymous mutations compared with EGFRL858Rtumors [35] aligning with the immunotherapy response data. At present, it is unclear what is driving the difference in the TMB between these alleles. It is possible that the increased mutation burden in EGFRL858Rtumors reflects the generally more advanced age of patients with EGFRL858R at diagnosis compared with patients with EGFRΔ19alterations [36, 37]. This association would suggest that a clock-like mutational process is at play in EGFR mutant tumors, but additional studies are needed to validate this hypothesis [38]. In addition, recent work has found that p53 alterations are associated with EGFR mutant lung cancer with higher TMB possibly suggesting a more genetically unstable and aggressive tumor state [35].

We also found that outcomes of patients treated with ICIs were not affected by EGFRT790M status or PD-L1 expression levels before immunotherapy. Although we found that fewer prior lines of therapy were associated with increased response to ICI, we unequivocally support the guidance that EGFR TKIs should be the preferred first line treatment option for patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer (irrespective of TMB or PD-L1). This guidance is based on substantially higher response rates to EGFR TKIs, the overall low rates of response to PD-(L)1 blockade in this subset of lung cancer, lack of efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in PD-L1+, TKI naïve, EGFR mutant lung cancer [16], and risk of synergistic toxicity with initial PD-1 blockade followed by osimertinib [39, 40].

This study combined data from multiple institutions, which has advantages and disadvantages. A major advantage is that by pooling data we were able to examine a larger cohort than we would have done individually; however, there is also heterogeneity in the analytical tools used at different institutions, although we aimed to normalize data to the size of the exome sequenced. Another possible limitation of this study was the inclusion of cases treated with different single agent ICIs [e.g. PD-1 (n = 140) and PD-L1 (n = 15)] or combinations of ICIs [e.g. PD-1 + CTLA-4 (n = 15) or PD-L1 + CTLA-4 (n = 1)]. It is possible that these treatment subsets might display unique survival outcomes that are masked by combining the cases.

In summary, our analysis revealed that EGFR mutant tumors have differing responses to ICIs and underlying molecular profiles. These data serve as a foundation for further investigating which patients with EGFR mutant disease have a higher likelihood of benefitting from immunotherapies, in particular when combined with chemotherapy or antiangiogenesis agents. Studies in animal models of EGFR mutant lung cancer with varying baseline mutations and TMB will also be valuable tools for evaluating such approaches. More broadly, our data provide rationale for evaluating genomic and molecular subsets within tumor types with lower TMB to better understand which features are associated with successful outcomes with ICIs.
