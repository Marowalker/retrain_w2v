Current staging methods for pancreatic cancer (PC) are inadequate, and biomarkers to
aid clinical decision making are lacking. Despite the availability of the serum marker
carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) for over two decades, its precise role in the
management of PC is yet to be defined, and as a consequence, it is not widely used.

Methods
We assessed the relationship between perioperative serum CA19.9 levels, survival and
adjuvant chemotherapeutic responsiveness in a cohort of 260 patients who underwent
operative resection for PC.

Results
By specifically assessing the subgroup of patients with detectable CA19.9, we
identified potential utility at key clinical decision points. Low postoperative CA19.9
at 3 months (median survival 25.6 vs 14.8 months,
P = 0.0052) and before adjuvant chemotherapy were
independent prognostic factors. Patients with postoperative CA 19.9 levels >90 U/ml
did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy
(P = 0.7194) compared with those with a CA19.9 of
≤90 U/ml (median 26.0 vs 16.7 months, P = 0.0108).
Normalization of CA19.9 within 6 months of resection was also an independent favorable
prognostic factor (median 29.9 vs 14.8 months,
P = 0.0004) and normal perioperative CA19.9 levels
identified a good prognostic group, which was associated with a 5-year survival of
42%.

Conclusions
Perioperative serum CA19.9 measurements are informative in patients with detectable
CA19.9 (defined by serum levels of >5 U/ml) and have potential clinical utility in
predicting outcome and response to adjuvant chemotherapy. Future clinical trials should
prioritize incorporation of CA19.9 measurement at key decision points to prospectively
validate these findings and facilitate implementation.

==== Body
introduction
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal solid organ malignancies. Pancreatectomy
offers the only potential for cure but is only possible in a minority of patients. Even in
those patients who undergo resection, most die because occult extrapancreatic metastatic
disease was likely present at the time of diagnosis [1]. Systemic therapies are only modestly effective in advanced disease but have a
significant impact in the adjuvant setting, with 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine both having
efficacy in a subgroup of patients and increasing 5-year survival from 10%–15% with
surgery alone to 20%–25% [2–5]. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to
develop biomarkers to better stratify patients for current treatment modalities and for the
testing of novel therapeutic strategies. Carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9), first isolated
in 1979 [6, 7], is the only available serum biomarker for PC and has shown some utility as a
diagnostic adjunct and a prognostic marker [8]
but is not widely used in routine clinical practice [9]. Serum biomarkers such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in prostate cancer,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in colorectal cancer and CA 125 in ovarian cancer, which have
similar limitations and although sometimes controversial are routinely used and are an
integral component of clinical trials in those diseases.

Defining the subgroup of individuals where CA19.9 measurement is robust in predicting
prognosis and chemotherapeutic responsiveness for PC would improve current management and
overall outcomes. Here, we show that serum CA19.9 has distinct potential clinical utility in
PC patients when assessed at distinct clinical decision points along the patient
journey.

patients and methods
Detailed clinicopathologic and outcome data were collected for 260 consecutive patients who
had a histopathologic diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and recorded CA19.9
levels from hospitals associated with the New South Wales Pancreatic Cancer Network,
Australia (NSWPCN; www.pancreaticcancer.net.au),
as previously described [10, 11]. This cohort of patients was retrospectively
and then prospectively recruited when the database was established in 1999. The censor date
was 30 September 2010. Ethical approval for the acquisition of data and biological material
was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee at each participating institution.
Clinical data were obtained from patients and family members, hospital notes and physician
records. Outcome data including the date and cause of death were sourced from the NSW Cancer
Registry and treating clinicians.

Survival was measured from the date of histopathologic diagnosis until date of death or
last follow-up. Patients with an R2 resection (macroscopically positive resection margins)
were excluded from the analysis. All patients were staged based on the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM (tumor–node–metastasis) classification, 7th
edition [12]. Recurrence was defined by
pathological confirmation by biopsy, cytology or clinical and radiographic findings
consistent with metastatic disease.

CA19.9 measurement
CA19.9 measurements were carried out at certified laboratories associated with the
hospital where the patients were treated. The upper limit of normal used for CA19.9 was 37
U/ml. Red cell phenotyping for Lewis antigen status was not carried out in the majority of
patients; therefore, patients whose CA19.9 levels were persistently <5 (termed
non-expressors) were deemed likely to be Lewis antigen
(Lea−b−) negative and were analyzed as a
separate group. Paired bilirubin and liver enzymes levels were also collected. CA19.9
levels may be artificially elevated in the setting of cholestasis and correcting it in
relation to the bilirubin may improve its applicability. Significant impairment in biliary
excretion for which bilirubin is a surrogate marker occurs when the bilirubin level is
>1.5 times the upper limit of normal (or >2 mg/dl) [13]. Analyses were carried out using CA19.9 values in patients
with normal bilirubin levels and in those with impaired biliary excretion (bilirubin >2
mg/dl). In patients with bilirubin >2 mg/dl, the corrected CA19.9 (cCA19.9) was
calculated by dividing the CA19.9 value by the bilirubin (in mg/dl) [13–15].

patient cohort
The cohort consisted of 260 consecutive patients who had a pathological diagnosis of
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreatic resection with curative intent
(macroscopically clear margins). The clinicopathologic characteristics are summarized in
supplementary TableS1 (available at Annals of Oncology online).
Clinico-pathologic factors associated with significantly better survival on univariate
analysis (Table 1) included tumors of the
pancreatic head (median survival 20.7 versus 11.9 months; P = 0.0053)
compared with those of the body/tail, tumor size ≤20 mm (34.4 versus 16.7 months;
P = 0.0019), absence of margin involvement (22.8 versus 13.2 months;
P = 0.0002), absence of lymph node metastases (22.2 versus 16.8 months;
P = 0.0261), and adjuvant chemotherapy (22.4 versus 16.7 months;
P = 0.0029).Table

Pre-resection CA19.9 values were available in 202 patients and were taken a median of 0.4
months before surgery. Of these, 10 patients (5%) had CA19.9 levels <5 pre- and
post-resection and in the absence of red cell phenotyping were deemed non-expressors.
Post-resection CA19.9 values were available in 231 patients but only 131 and 162 patients
had levels carried out within 3 and 6 months of surgery, respectively, and of these, 9
were excluded from the analysis due to being classified as non-expressors. Paired pre- and
post-resection (within 3 months) CA19.9 values were available in 88 patients with 3
non-expressors excluded from the analysis.

Paired bilirubin assays at the time of CA19.9 measurement were available for all patients
included in the analysis. Hyperbilirubinemia, defined as serum level greater than 1.5
times the upper limit of normal (>2 mg/dl or 34.2 μmol/l), was used as a marker of
impaired biliary excretion. In the pre-resection group, the median bilirubin level was 2.0
mg/dL with hyperbilirubinemia present in 91 (45%). In the post-resection group, the median
bilirubin level was 0.5 mg/dl with hyperbilirubinamia in eight (6%). In the paired pre-
and post-resection group hyperbilirubinamia was present in 40 (45%) and 2 (2%),
respectively.

statistical analysis
Median survival was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and the difference
tested using the log-rank test. P values of <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. Clinicopathologic variables analyzed with a significant
P value and those reported to be significant were entered into a Cox
Proportional Hazard multivariate analysis and models resolved using backward elimination
of redundant variables. Statistical analysis was carried out using Statview 5.0 Software
(Abacus Systems, Berkeley, CA). Disease-specific survival (DSS) was used as the primary
end point.

results
Clinically relevant time points were examined to specifically assess a potential role in
clinical decision making (ie at 3 months post-resection, within 6 months; before adjuvant
therapy, and after adjuvant therapy). We initially assessed the value of post-resection
CA19.9 in patients who produced CA19.9 (>5 U/ml) in relation to DSS and subsequently
their response to adjuvant chemotherapy. In addition, we examined the potential value of
preoperative CA19.9 and the change in level with surgery, with and without adjustment for
hyperbilirubinamia.

prognostic value of CA19.9
post-resection CA19.9 and survival
Of the 122 patients with CA19.9 values at or within 3 months of surgery, the majority
(114; 93%) had bilirubin levels <2 mg/dl and did not require CA19.9 adjustment. The
post-resection CA19.9 cosegregated with DSS on univariate analysis into three prognostic
groups: (i) those with <37 U/ml had the best outcome, (ii) 37–120 U/ml, an
intermediate outcome, and (iii) >120 U/ml, the worst outcome (median 25.6 versus 20.7
versus 14.8 months, P = 0.0052; Figure 1A). In the 37–120 U/ml group, the CA19.9
decreased in five patients, normalized in three and increased in five patients at 6
months, suggesting that the intermediate group (37–120 U/ml) consisted of those
that had elevated CA19.9 due to other causes as well as residual disease. Those within
the normal range (<37 U/ml) within 6 months of resection had a better outcome (median
29.9 versus 14.8 months; P = 0.0004; Figure 1B).Figure

post-resection CA19.9 and recurrence
Of the 122 patients with post-resection CA 19.9 values, 76 had pathologically clear
resection margins (R0), permitting assessment of disease-free survival (DFS). The median
time to recurrence was 9.0 months (range 0.4–57). DFS paralleled DSS. Patients
with a CA19.9 in the normal range within 3 months had significantly longer DFS than
patients with CA19.9 >37 U/ml (median DFS 22.0 versus 11.5 months,
P = 0.0194; Figure 1C).

pre-resection CA19.9 and survival
The ability to predict prognosis before pancreatectomy would significantly improve
outcomes by better selecting patients for surgery. Preoperative measures of CA19.9 are
often confounded by biliary obstruction, and as a consequence, we assessed if serum
CA19.9 adjusted for hyperbilirubinamia could be used as a reliable measure of outcome.
Of the 202 patients with available pre-resection CA19.9 values, 111 had paired bilirubin
levels <2 mg/dl with a median CA19.9 of 138 U/ml (range 1–26 600). Those
with a pre-resection CA19.9 <120 U/ml were associated with better DSS (median 35.6 vs
17.4, P = 0.0444; Figure 1D). In the remaining 91 patients with hyperbilirubinaemia, the
median uncorrected and corrected CA19.9 was 351 and 28, respectively (range
1–101 075 and 0.1–16 780). Combined uncorrected and corrected
pre-resection cCA19.9 <120 was also associated with a better DSS (22.2 versus 16.7,
P = 0.0058; Figure 1E). Table 2
summarizes the univariate analysis for all categories of CA19.9 measurement. In
addition, pre-resection CA19.9 was associated with pathological stage in patients with
normal bilirubin levels but there was a wide range in CA19.9 values for each stage with
overlap in the values between stages diminishing its clinical applicability (see
Supplementary data, available at Annals of Oncology
online).Table

perioperative change in CA19.9 and survival
Of the 85 patients with pre- and post-resection cCA19.9 values, the cCA19.9 level
remained <37 U/ml (but >5) in 38 patients, decreased in 22 patients and increased
in 25. These clustered into three corresponding prognostic groups: (i) <37 U/ml pre-
and post-resection, (ii) a decrease in CA 19.9 and (iii) an increase in CA 19.9.
Patients whose CA 19.9 was always in the normal range had a better survival compared
with the CA 19.9 decrease and increase groups (median survival 26.0 versus 19.6 versus
13.3 months, P = 0.0046; Figure 1F; supplementary data, available at Annals of Oncology
online).

multivariate analysis
A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was developed using clinicopathologic
variables with P <0.05 and those reported to be prognostic on
univariate analysis (Tables 1 and 2). The resolved multivariate model after
removal of redundant variables showed that post-resection CA19.9 >120 U/ml, positive
resection margins, and adjuvant chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors (Table
3).

predictive value of CA19.9
post-resection CA19.9 and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy
Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with better survival overall
(P = 0.0029; Table 1); however, only patients with pre-adjuvant chemotherapy
CA19.9 values <90 U/ml appeared to benefit. Of 71 patients with a post-resection
CA19.9 <90 U/ml (measured within a month of commencement of adjuvant therapy or at an
equivalent time point for surgery-only patients), 48 had adjuvant chemotherapy (45
received gemcitabine-based regimens). In these patients, adjuvant chemotherapy was
associated with a significant survival benefit (median survival 26.0 versus 16.7 months,
P = 0.0108; Figure 2A and 2C). There were 35
patients with post-resection CA19.9 >90 U/ml. Of these, 19 received adjuvant
chemotherapy, with no statistically significant survival benefit (median survival 16.2
versus 9.0 months, P = 0.7194; Table 2 and Figure 2B, D and E). Multivariate
analysis of variables within the CA19.9 <90 U/ml subgroup showed that adjuvant
chemotherapy and size were independent prognostic factors with involved margins of
borderline significance (Table 3).
Although numbers were small, early data suggested that normal CA19.9 levels after
completion of adjuvant therapy in those patients who produce CA19.9 may be associated
with an excellent outcome (Figure 2F). At the
censor date, all patients with post-chemotherapy CA19.9 >37 U/ml had developed
metastatic disease. Two patients were alive with recurrences at 12 and 13 months,
respectively, and the remainder had died of metastatic PC. Of those with
post-chemotherapy CA19.9 <37 U/ml, 1 of the 11 patients had developed a recurrence
with peritoneal involvement 48.9 months after the initial resection (41.6 months after
completing chemotherapy).Figure

discussion
Despite its acceptance as a measure of PC tumor burden, caveats in the interpretation of CA
19.9 values limit application across the full spectrum of PC. First, CA19.9 is a sialylated
Lewis a (Lea) antigen. Lewis antigens are normal components of exocrine
epithelial secretions present on erythrocyte membranes formed from type I oligosaccharide
precursors that undergo sequential addition of monosaccharides by a set of
glycosyltransferases and fucosyltransferases [16]. Two independent genes determine the Lewis phenotype: the Lewis gene or
α1-4 fucosyltransferase (also known as FUT3) and the secretor gene or α1-2
fucosyltransferase (FUT2) [17]. Individuals who
lack a functional FUT3 allele are termed Lewis negative (Lea−b−) and
are unable to synthesize CA19.9 [18]. They
comprise 7%–10% of Caucasians, but their incidence is higher in other populations such
as Africans (22%) [17, 18]. Individuals with at least one functional FUT3 allele are
characterized by the red cell phenotype Lea+b− or
Lea−b+ (rarely Lea+b+).
Lack of a functional FUT2 allele leads to the non-secretor phenotype (se/se), which is
characterized by the absence of ABH determinants in saliva and on some epithelial cell types
[16]. Non-secretors in general have higher
serum and urine CA19.9 levels than secretors [19]. Second, CA 19.9 can also be elevated in benign pancreatic diseases such as
pancreatitis [20], which often coexist with PC.
Third, CA19.9 undergoes some degree of biliary excretion and is produced by biliary
epithelial cells. Therefore, in the setting of cholestasis, CA19.9 levels are frequently
elevated even in benign conditions [21].

Serum CA19.9 possesses many features of a robust or clinically useful biomarker and has
been well studied to define its limitations outlined above. Despite this, there are no clear
applications for CA19.9 in the management of PC as there are for other similar serum
biomarkers such as PSA for prostate cancer, CEA for colorectal cancer and CA 125 in ovarian
cancer, which are although sometimes controversial, used in routine practice and form
integral components of clinical trials to further advance clinical management. We focused on
defining potential roles for serum CA19.9 at key clinical decision-making time points in
patients who have demonstrable CA19.9 production. If an individual is identified to have the
capacity to produce CA19.9, either through Lewis antigen testing or through a level over 5
U/ml at diagnosis as a surrogate, postoperative CA19.9 measurements have potential
prognostic and predictive value. First, normalization of CA19.9 postoperatively is
associated with a good prognosis. Second, postoperative CA19.9 levels >90 U/ml may be
associated with a lack of response to adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, and third,
although numbers are small, a normal CA19.9 after completion of adjuvant therapy is
potentially associated with an excellent prognosis. These potential applications are
summarized in Figure 3, which also proposes how
CA19.9 levels could be incorporated in to trials to inform clinical decision making.Figure 3 Schematic representation of suggested
time points for CA19.9 measurements in clinical trials that would specifically address
critical decision points and other applications such as surrogate end points to

prognostic value of CA19.9
Postoperative CA19.9 measurements at 3 months (when hyperbilirubinamia is uncommon)
co-segregate into three prognostic groups. The intermediate prognostic group of
37–120 U/ml at that time likely includes a mix of those with progressive disease and
other causes of increased CA19.9 levels (biliary dysfunction and pancreatitis). This group
declares itself by the 6-month stage to segregate into two prognostic groups dichotomized
by the normal reference value (37 U/ml). In addition, a normal level both pre- and
postoperatively identifies a group with the best prognosis, which has a 5-year survival of
42%.

The key element of the present study is that potential clinical utility was directly
examined by assessing CA19.9 at specific decision-making time points. Overall, although
not directly comparable, our findings with regard to the prognostic value of CA19.9 are
supported by evidence from retrospective cohorts and in clinical trials. In patients
undergoing pancreatic resection for PC, the preoperative CA19.9 value is associated with
tumor stage, resectability, risk of recurrence and survival [13, 22–26]. Even with intercurrent biliary obstruction,
which is present in ∼50% of patients, adjustment of CA19.9 levels relative to the
degree of hyperbilirubinamia may still have potential prognostic value and further
evaluation is encouraged. The postoperative level and the change in CA19.9 have also been
correlated with survival and risk of recurrence [27–31]. Evidence is emerging
that post-resection CA19.9 velocity, akin to PSA doubling time in prostate cancer, may be
a better predictor of recurrence and survival [32]. In addition, for nonresectable patients, the CA19.9 at the time of
diagnosis is also a prognostic factor [33].

predictive value of CA19.9
In patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy for advanced PC, the change in CA19.9
correlates with objective (radiographic) response and survival [34–37]. The
poor survival of the majority of patients even with clinically localized PC who undergo
resection is likely due to occult metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Based on
the rationale of adjuvant therapy targeting low-volume disease and that serum CA19.9 is a
measure of disease burden, CA19.9 may have predictive value in the adjuvant setting. A key
finding in our study is that patients with a post-resection CA19.9 >90 U/ml did not
achieve long-term benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas those with CA 19.9 <90
U/ml did. Previous studies have generally not addressed the relationship between CA19.9
and response to adjuvant therapy; however, assumptions were made and selection criteria
altered based on CA 19.9 levels. In CONKO-001, which compared adjuvant gemcitabine to
observation, patients with postoperative CA19.9 values >2.5 times the upper limit of
normal (≈90 U/ml) were excluded.[4] In
contrast, no CA19.9 exclusion criteria were used in ESPAC-1 and ESPACas-3 or RTOG-9704
[2, 3, 5]. In the analysis of CA19.9
data from the RTOG-9704 study of gemcitabine versus 5-FU before and after chemoradiation,
Berger et al. [29] identified that patients
with a CA19.9 >90 U/ml had a poor survival (23.0 versus 10.4 months). Our results
suggest that patients with a post-resection CA19.9 >90 U/ml do not obtain long-term
benefit from current systemic chemotherapy regimens and support integration of CA19.9
testing pre- and post-adjuvant therapy to define its role as a predictive marker and a
surrogate end point.

In conclusion, assessing serum CA19.9 at specific clinically relevant time points while
cognizant of its limitations has significant potential utility. These strategies should be
incorporated into future clinical trials as a priority, which will define its precise role
in the routine management of pancreatic cancer, and like PSA for prostate cancer,
potentially become part of routine clinical practice.
