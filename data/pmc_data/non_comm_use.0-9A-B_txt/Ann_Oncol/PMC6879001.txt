Conflicting data exist about the impact of antibiotic exposure on clinical outcome during immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Routy et al. [1] and Derosa et al. [2] described a detrimental effect of antibiotic administration on clinical outcome during ICB in aNSCLC, which is in line with our single-center experience at the tertiary cancer center in Salzburg [3]. Derosa et al. reported an inferior median overall survival (mOS) associated with the use of antibiotics within a time frame of 30 days [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.4] or 60 days (HR = 2.0) preceding ICB initiation in 239 patients with aNSCLC [2]. In contrast, Metges et al. found a survival advantage for patients receiving antibiotics up to 60 days before or during ICB (mOS: 16.2 versus 11.5 months, P = 0.01) in 325 aNSCLC patients [4].

In our bi-centric analysis, including 96 non-squamous aNSCLC patients, no influence of antibiotic exposure on mOS from ICB initiation was found (AB--group: 11.2 versus AB+-group: 12.2 months, HR = 0.84, P = 0.546, Figure 1A). In contrast to Derosa et al. and Metges et al., the defined time frame of antibiotic exposure ranged from one month before to 1 month after ICB start in our analysis. Neither the time point of antibiotic administration (before: 15.5 months, after: 6.3 months, before and after: not reached, P = 0.060), nor a distinct antibiotic class applied as monotherapy (P = 0.954) was associated with mOS.


Figure 1. Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival according to the antibiotic treatment status. Comparison of Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival between antibiotic-positive and antibiotic-negative group in advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer for the entire cohort (A), for the tertiary cancer center in Salzburg (B) and for the tertiary cancer center in Linz (C). The 95% confidence interval is shown in brackets. Tick marks represent censored patients. medOS, median overall survival; HR, hazard ratio. 

While the detrimental effect of antibiotic exposure on clinical outcome with ICB was corroborated in our aNSCLC cohort in Salzburg (N = 43, AB--group: mOS 13.6 versus AB+-group: 7.5 months, HR = 2.04, P = 0.046, Figure 1B) [3], an opposite effect was found at the tertiary cancer center in Linz (N = 53; AB--group: mOS 10.8 months versus AB+-group: not reached, HR = 0.33, P = 0.008, Figure 1C). The imbalance of ECOG performance status (PS) at the time point of ICB initiation between the centers in Salzburg and Linz (ECOG PS ≥2: 30% versus 0%, P < 0.001, supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology online) might have laid the basis for a confounding bias. It is noteworthy that ECOG PS in our bicentric AB+-group was worse in comparison to the Derosa study (ECOG PS ≥2: 13% versus 1%). However, the antibiotic treatment status and ECOG PS remained independently associated with mOS in multivariate analysis in the latter study [2]. Compared with Derosa et al. (20% within 30 days, 28% within 60 days) and Metges et al. (47% within 60 days), 40% of patients had been exposed to antibiotics in our cohort predominantly as empiric antibiotic therapy and for upper respiratory tract infections.

Despite the high clinical interest in this topic, only a few retrospective studies have reported an inferior outcome with antibiotics use during ICB and the question arises whether a publication bias exists. In consideration of the limited and conflicting data and due to putative heterogeneity between tertiary cancer centers as depicted in our bi-centric approach, prospective stratification according to the antibiotic treatment status is necessitated in future clinical trials to clarify the impact of antibiotic administration on clinical outcome with ICB.
