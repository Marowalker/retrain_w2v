The below corrections were inadvertently missed before final publication:

On page 1, in the sentence ‘This trend coincides with increasing concerns about the off-label use of these agent, the costs of these drugs to patients and to the health care system and our ability to learn from off-label use.’- the word ‘agent’ should have been ‘agents’.

On page 2, in the sentence ‘Several countries are now using similar protocols [e.g. TAPUR (NCT02693535) and CAPTUR (NCT03297606) Pro Target] which specifically allow data sharing.’- the words ‘Pro Target’ should have been deleted.

These corrections have now been made. The Publisher apologizes for the error.
