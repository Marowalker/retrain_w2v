Msx1 and Msx2 encode homeodomain transcription
factors that play a role in several embryonic developmental processes.
Previously, we have shown that in the adult mouse,
Msx1lacZ is expressed in vascular smooth muscle
cells (VSMCs) and pericytes, and that
Msx2lacZ is also expressed in VSMCs as well as
in a few endothelial cells (ECs). The mouse retina and choroid are two
highly vascularized tissues. Vessel alterations in the retina are associated
with several human diseases and the retina has been intensely used for
angiogenesis studies, whereas the choroid has been much less investigated. Using
the Msx1lacZ and
Msx2lacZ reporter alleles, we observed that
Msx2 is not expressed in the eye vascular tree in contrast
to Msx1, for which we establish the spatial and temporal
expression pattern in these tissues. In the retina, expression of
Msx1 takes place from P3, and by P10, it becomes confined
to a subpopulation of ECs at branching points of superficial arterioles. These
branching sites are characterized by a subpopulation of mural cells that also
show specific expression programs. Specific Msx gene inactivation in the
endothelium, using Msx1 and Msx2 conditional
mutant alleles together with a Tie2-Cre transgene, did not lead
to conspicuous structural defects in the retinal vascular network. Expression of
Msx1 at branching sites might therefore be linked to vessel
physiology. The retinal blood flow is autonomously regulated and perfusion of
capillaries has been proposed to depend on arteriolar precapillary structures
that might be the sites for Msx1 expression. On the other hand,
branching sites are subject to shear stress that might induce
Msx1 expression. In the choroid vascular layer
Msx1lacZ is expressed more broadly and
dynamically. At birth Msx1lacZ expression takes
place in the endothelium but at P21 its expression has shifted towards the mural
layer. We discuss the possible functions of Msx1 in the eye
vasculature.

Introduction
Angiogenesis is the process by which pre-existent vessels rearrange in order to give
rise to new vascular beds (Jain,
2003). The mouse retina is one of the best characterized models for
in vivo vessel formation as it displays all of the
morphological hallmarks of angiogenesis (i.e. sprouting, branching, fusion,
remodelling and maturation) after birth (Fruttiger, 2002, 2007). In
contrast to human, murine newborns do not possess a developed retinal vascular
plexus (Gyllensten and Hellstrom,
1954). In these, the superficial retinal vascular plexus forms during
the first week after birth by radial outgrowth of vessels from the optic nerve entry
point to the periphery (Fruttiger, 2007;
Stahl et al., 2010). These
superficial vessels reach the retinal edges at approximately post-natal day
(P) 9 and from this stage onwards, vertical sprouting forms the deep and
then intermediate vascular beds, that reach the retinal periphery at approximately
P12 and P15, respectively. The three retina vascular beds become fully mature and
interconnected at the end of the third postnatal week (Stahl et al., 2010). At this stage, the retinal
superficial vasculature is composed of six major arteries and veins that form
primary branches into arterioles and venules. Arterioles and venules branch into a
capillary network that is in direct contact with deep and intermediate layers. This
network is covered with pericytes, providing retina with the densest coverage of
pericytes in the whole vasculature (Shepro and
Morel, 1993). The choroidal vascular system, which resides between
the retina and the sclera, is fully developed before birth and supplies oxygen and
nutrients to the avascular retina (Campochiaro,
2000). At early stages, the blood supply of the eye is also provided
by the hyaloid vasculature that originates from the central hyaloid artery in the
optic nerve and extends through the primitive vitreous toward the anterior segment
(Saint-Geniez and D'Amore,
2004). The hyaloid vasculature regresses when ocular development
proceeds in order to leave a transparent visual axis (Mitchell and Gingras, 1998; Brown et al., 2005).

Blood vessels are mainly composed of an inner endothelial cell (EC) layer
externally covered by mural cells, namely vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) in arteries and veins, and pericytes in capillaries (Jain, 2003). In the mature vascular
plexus, mural cells contribute to endothelial tube stabilization, maintenance of
vascular permeability and regulation of the blood flow. In small arterioles and
capillaries, most of these activities are performed by pericytes (Orlidge and D'Amore, 1987; Sato and Rifkin, 1989; Diaz-Flores et al., 2009; Armulik et al., 2011). In the central nervous system, not all the
pericytes contain the muscle-specific actin isoform, only those in the pre- and
postcapillary regions (i.e. on arterioles and venules) (Nehls and Drenckhahn, 1991; Rucker et al., 2000). This led to the
proposition that blood flow is regulated mainly at the level of precapillary
arterioles (Anderson and McIntosh, 1967;
Baez, 1977). However, time-lapse and
functional analyses have demonstrated that capillaries are capable of regulating
blood flow along their whole length (Metea and
Newman, 2006; Peppiatt et al.,
2006). In the eye, vasoconstriction and vasodilatation via the
pericytes are evoked by light-induced stimulation of perivascular astrocytes
(Metea and Newman, 2006).

Msx genes encode homeodomain transcription factors and are essential for normal
craniofacial and limb development, nervous system patterning, eye formation, as
assessed by phenotypic abnormalities in knock-out mice (Bach et al., 2003; Wu et al.,
2003; Ishii et al., 2005; Lallemand et al., 2005, 2009). In the cardiovascular system, Msx genes have
previously been shown to be important for outflow tract patterning (Ishii et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007), head vessel maturation (Lopes et al., 2011) and adult vessel
calcification (Towler et al.,
2006). In adult mice, Msx2lacZ is mainly
expressed in a subset of VSMCs in peripheral arteries and veins (brachial,
femoral and caudal), as well as a few ECs of the aorta.
Mxs1lacZ is expressed to a lesser extent by
VSMCs of peripheral arterial trunks, but is highly expressed in mural cells of
arterioles and capillaries that irrigate the tissues (Goupille et al., 2008).

In this paper, we observe that Msx2lacZ expression is not
detectable in eye vessels, and describe Msx1 expression patterns in
the retina and choroid vasculature. In the choroid,
Msx1lacZ is expressed in a broad dynamic pattern,
initially in the endothelium. Expression is observed later on in VSMCs, similar to
Msx1 general behaviour in the peripheral vasculature. In
contrast, in the retina, Msx1lacZ expression is
restricted to ECs of the arteriolar branching points in the superficial vascular
network. At these branch points, we further characterised a sub-population of
pericytes, which express high levels of NG2, α-SMA and desmin. We thus
demonstrate specific properties of cells constituting these branching structures,
not only in the mural layer but also in the endothelial layer.

Results
Kinetics of Msx1lacZ expression in vessels of the
developing retina
Outgrowth of vessels in the retina occurs postnatally from the central optical
disc. This results in the formation of a stereotyped vascular network
(Fruttiger, 2007). Analysis
of Msx1lacZ mice at P0 revealed that the primitive
plexus was formed of ECs and did neither express smooth muscle actin, nor
Msx1 (Fig. 1A,A′, arrowheads). The hyaloid vasculature,
which is present during prenatal development and regresses shortly after birth,
expressed strong levels of Msx1lacZ as revealed by
Xgal staining, and was covered with α-SMA-expressing mural cells (Fig. 1A,A′, arrows).
Considering the morphology of the β-galactosidase
(β-gal)-positive nuclei and their position relative to isolectin
B4 (Ib4) and α-SMA domains, Msx1-expressing cells
were likely ECs. At P3, retinal arteries have started to form from the primitive
plexus. These arteries, which were part of the newly-formed vascular plexus
(Fig. 1B′; data not
shown), were covered with α-SMA-positive mural cells. In these
arteries, Msx1 expression was detected in cells with elongated
nuclei, suggesting they belonged to the endothelium (Fig. 1B,B′, arrows). At this stage, no
Msx1 expression could be detected in less mature vessels
not covered by mural cells (Fig. 1B,B′, arrowheads). At P10, the superficial
vessels have reached the peripheral edge of the retina, the capillary bed has
begun to develop into the deeper layers and circulation has started (Brown et al., 2005; Fruttiger, 2007). Strikingly, at this stage
Msx1lacZ expression became restricted to
primary branching points in arterioles (Fig. 1C,C′, arrows). Restricted expression was not
yet completed by P12, since a few cells were still expressing
Msx1 along the length of arteries (Fig. 2A, arrowheads), but was
achieved at P14 (Fig. 1D,D′). In most cases, more than one nucleus
was labelled (Fig. 1F, Fig. 3D-F, Fig. 4A,C). At the branching points, we further
observed strong Ib4 concentration that co-localized with
Msx1-expressing cells (Fig. 1C′-F′, arrows). Ib4 is known to bind
the basement membranes (specifically, the versican protein) and thus
can label not only ECs but also microglial cells and probably other cell types
including some vascular mural cells. On trypsin-digested retinas, Ib4 was
unambiguously associated with vessels (not shown). Maximum
Msx1 expression occurred between P14 and P23 (Fig. 1D–E), but expression
was maintained at high levels up to P480 (Fig. 1F) and probably lasts over the lifetime of the
animal. From P14, we observed that Msx1 also labelled secondary
branches in the arteriolar network (Fig. 1F, Fig. 4D). Noticeably, at all stages, Msx1
expression was observed only in rather mature arteries that were covered by a
SMA-positive mural cell coating suggesting that Msx1 expression
in the endothelium requires EC-VSMC interactions. Msx1-labelled
branching sites were quantitated throughout development (Fig. 2). There was a large and
steady increase between P9 and P23 and thereafter the number plateaued.
Therefore, restriction of the expression to branching sites lagged behind the
formation of the vascular superficial bed, for which arteries reach the retinal
periphery around P8 (Fruttiger,
2007). This was not achieved before the onset of blood flow, which
in the mouse retina takes place between P3 and P4 (Brown et al., 2005). From P23, we observed
Msx1 expression at all primary, and some secondary,
branching points along the main retinal arteries.

Xgal staining (blue, arrows) labels the nucleus of
Msx1-expressing cells.
(A′–F′) show the corresponding fluorescence
fields for ECs (IB4, green) and mural cells (α-SMA,
red). At P0 (A, A′), the superficial plexus that is
just beginning to develop around the optic nerve does not express
Msx1lacZ (arrowheads). At
the same stage the hyaloid vessels are covered with α-SMA-positive
cells and are labelled with Xgal (arrows). At P3 (B,
B′), Msx1lacZ is expressed in
elongated nuclei along the first formed retinal arteries
(arrows) that are covered with α-SMA-positive cells. Note
that these arteries are in continuity with the vascular immature,
endothelial plexus that does not express
Msx1lacZ (arrowheads). Around
P10 (C, C′), Xgal staining starts to concentrate at the
primary branching sites of the superficial retinal arteries
(arrows). Note that some branching sites express
Msx1 very weakly at this stage
(arrowheads). Expression is observed in all primary branch
points at later stages, such as P23 (E, E′) and P480
(F, F′), and even at some secondary branches (F,
F′). Xgal staining was most intense between P14 and P23
(D, E). In all panels, scale bar  = 50
µm.

At P12 (A), some expression is still observed along the vessels

From P23 to P480 (B,C), expression is restricted to branch
sites (arrows). In A–C, artery layout is depicted for

analysed. At P0 and P3, no Msx1-positive branching
points were observed. They then increased significantly in number from
P9 to P23. From this stage, this number remained stable.

(A,C,D,F) mural (α-SMA, red) or
(B–F) endothelial (CD31, green) markers and
β-gal (A–F, yellow). At branching sites, the
β-gal signal is nuclear and is completely restricted to
CD31-positive cells (B,E, arrowheads), which are themselves
ensheathed in the α-SMA-positive cell layer (A,D, arrows).
This is particularly obvious in merged images (C,F),
demonstrating that β-gal-expressing cells are endothelial cells. In
all panels, scale bar  = 20 µm.

Fig. 4. Characterization of the Msx1-expressing branching
points.
Flat-mount retinas from P14 Msx1lacZ mice
were stained with Xgal (A–D) in combination with
antibodies against α-SMA (A′, red), desmin
(B′, red), the pericyte marker NG2 (C′,
green), or the basal lamina protein laminin (D′,
green). α-SMA labels VSMCs and a population of pericytes that
are concentrated at the beginning of the primary branches
(A,A′, arrows). Most of the mural cells observed at the
major branching points also express desmin (B′) and NG2
(C′). Laminin signal is strongest in the major
arterioles and at the beginning on the primary branches
(D′). The vast majority of primary, and some secondary,
branches do express Msx1lacZ
(D,D′). Msx1lacZ-positive
cells adopt a luminal localization relatively to the mural markers. In
all panels, scale bar  = 50 µm.

Arteries and veins were identified in flat mounts by virtue of their distinct
morphologies and differential coating by mural cells. We did not observe
Msx1lacZ labelling of venules in the retina
(data not shown), as in any other veins (Goupille et al., 2008). Only the superficial vascular
network was labelled. This is in keeping with the fact that deeper beds are
primarily formed by sprouting from veins (Fruttiger, 2007). Xgal staining reflected the specific
expression of Msx1 in retinal vessels since no staining was
observed in normal mice (data not shown). In contrast to what was
observed in peripheral arteries (Goupille
et al., 2008), Msx2lacZ could not be
detected in hyaloid, retina or choroid vessels at any stage of their development
(data not shown).

Msx1lacZ is expressed specifically in ECs
Xgal staining is useful for a broad analysis of expression patterns. However, it
does not provide sufficiently high resolution for precise co-localization
studies using optical microscopy. In order to identify in which cell type
Msx1lacZ is expressed, we used an anti
β-gal antibody together with endothelial-specific (anti-CD31) and
mural-specific (anti-α-SMA) antibodies, to perform confocal
microscopy on flat mount retinas. This showed that the Msx1
reporter gene is expressed in ECs (Fig. 3B,E, arrowheads) and not in mural cells
(Fig. 3A,D, arrows).
Indeed, the nuclear β-gal signal was completely surrounded by CD31 protein
and was observed in a luminal position relative to the mural marker α-SMA
(Fig. 3C,F). As
expected, β-gal colocalized with nuclear Hoechst staining, since the
lacZ gene in this transgenic mouse is associated with a
nuclear localisation sequence (not shown).

Correlation between expression of Msx1 and branch
point-characteristic proteins
To get insight into the role of Msx1 at arteriolar branching
points, we investigated possible correlations with accumulation of other
proteins. We co-stained the retina from Msx1lacZ
animals for β-gal together with α-SMA (Fig. 4A,A′), desmin (Fig. 4B,B′) and NG2
(Fig. 4C,C′).
In the rat retina, NG2 and desmin are expressed in immature mural cells around
birth, but NG2 is expressed in pericytes in the adult and weakly in arteriole
and vein VSMCs, whereas desmin remains at a high level in pericytes and VSMCs.
On the contrary, α-SMA, which is also expressed in immature mural cells,
becomes highly expressed in VSMCs and weakly in pericytes after birth
(Hughes and Chan-Ling,
2004). According to our data, the primary branching structures were
supported by a sub-population of mural cells that expressed α-SMA
(Fig. 4A′),
desmin (Fig. 4B′)
and NG2 (Fig. 4C′).
Of note, calponin is expressed primarily in VSMCs, although it has been
described in pericytes of aged animals (Hughes and Chan-Ling, 2004; Hughes
et al., 2006). Calponin was expressed in a fraction of branching
structures, and always in cells on the distal side relative to the arteriole
(not shown). Thus, at the branch sites, the sub-population of mural
cells differs from others by its capacity to express simultaneously
VSMC-associated proteins, such as α-SMA and calponin, together with pericyte
markers like NG2 and desmin. Of note, α-SMA, desmin and calponin are
proteins that participate in contraction, making this structure a candidate for
specific contractile properties. Furthermore, according to Ib4 (Fig. 1C′–F′)
and laminin (Fig. 4D′,
arrows) expression levels, the density of the basement membrane at these
branching points appeared high.

No apparent developmental defect in Msx1 flox/
flox
Msx2 flox/ flox Tie2Cre mutant
To further investigate the possible function of Msx genes in the retinal
endothelium, we inactivated Msx1 and Msx2
specifically in ECs, taking advantage of the previously described
Msx1flox (Fu et al., 2007) and
Msx2flox (Bensoussan et al., 2008) alleles, and the
Tie2-Cre transgene (Kisanuki et al., 2001). Only Msx1 is expressed
in the retina; however Msx2 was also inactivated to avoid any
compensation between the two genes (Ishii
et al., 2005; Lopes et al.,
2011).

Tie2-Cre has been shown to specifically induce loxP site recombination in the
retina EC plexus (Ye et al., 2009;
Weskamp et al., 2010; Sweet et al., 2011). However, no data
has been reported referring to the efficiency of this transgene in ECs at
branching site. To ascertain this point, we associated the RosamT/mG
reporter gene (Muzumdar et al.,
2007), that expresses Tomato red before and
Gfp after loxP recombination, with the
Tie2-Cre transgene. GFP was revealed on dissected retinas
using specific anti-GFP antibodies, together with antibodies against endothelial
(CD31) or mural (α-SMA) markers. This demonstrated
recombination in all ECs, including those residing at branching sites
(supplementary material Fig. S1).

These data allowed us to perform the functional analysis. Dissected retinas from
Msx1 flox/+ Msx2 flox/+
Tie2-Cre</emph> and Msx1 flox/ flox Msx2 flox/
flox Tie2-Cre mice were labelled for CD31,
α-SMA and desmin, then analysed in flat mount by
confocal microscopy. Msx1 and Msx2
inactivation in the endothelium did not result in major structural defects,
neither at P7, when the vessels are intensely sprouting (Fig. 5A-F), nor in two
months-old animals, when angiogenesis is achieved (Fig. 5G–L). At the two stages, CD31
staining (Fig. 5A,D, C,F and
G–J) did not reveal either over- or under-branching in
arteries, where Msx1lacZ is expressed. Furthermore,
considering the intensity of α-SMA (Fig. 5B,E and H,K) and desmin (Fig. 5I,L) signals, there was no conspicuous
reduction in VSMC coverage or decrease in the expression of contractile proteins
at branching sites. In the retina, desmin is strongly expressed in pericytes
(Hughes and Chan-Ling,
2004), and we could not detect any difference in the number of
desmin-positive cells in capillaries of mutant versus control embryos
(Fig. 5I,L).

Fig. 5. There is no evident phenotypic alterations in the Msx1
flox/ flox Msx2 flox/ flox Tie2-Cre
mouse retinas.
Retinas from heterozygous (A–C) or mutant
(D–F) P7 mice were stained for CD31 (green,
A,D,C,F), α-SMA (red, B,E); similarly, retinas from 2
months old mice were stained for CD31 (green, G,J), α-SMA
(red, H,K) and desmin (red, I,L). At P7, the overall
structure of retina vasculature does not look changed (A,D) in
mutants. Close up images of the angiogenic front do not show differences
in vascular density or in the morphological characteristics and number
of tip cells (C,F). At this stage, only the main arterial
branches are covered by VSMCs in both the mutant (E) and the
control (B). In retinas from 2 month-old mice, the density of
branches along the endothelial tube appears unchanged in the mutant
according to CD31 staining (G,J). The intensity and number of
cells expressing α-SMA is similar between the Msx1
flox/ flox Msx2 flox/ flox Tie2-Cre
mutant (K) and the Msx1 flox/+
Msx2 flox/+ Tie2-Cre control
(H). The desmin-positive population of pericytes does not look
affected by the endothelial-specific Msx gene inactivation
(I,L). Note that, in D, the centre of the retina was
accidentally lost during dissection. In panels A,B and D,E, scale bar is
400 µm, in panels G,H and J,K, 40 µm, in
panels C, F and I, 100 µm and in panel L,
50 µm, respectively.

Msx1 is broadly expressed in choroid vessels
To verify whether this branch site-restricted expression pattern is more
widespread in the eye vasculature, we investigated Msx1
expression in the choroid. In the mouse, choroidal vasculature is fully
developed before birth and supplies oxygen and nutrients to the anterior region
of the retina (Campochiaro,
2000). Similar to the retinal vasculature, it develops according to
a stereotyped pattern, constituted of major arteries that grow from the optic
nerve entry point toward the periphery. Msx1lacZ
expression was detectable as early E16.5 and became conspicuous at E17.5. At
these stages, expression took place in arterioles covered with
α-SMA-expressing mural cells and also in mural
cell-free capillaries (data not shown). At P0,
Msx1lacZ was broadly expressed in choroidal
vessels, at a high level (Fig. 6A,A′). On flat mounts, expression was
observed in internal, longitudinal cells, which matched Ib4 labelling,
suggesting it took place in ECs. Similar to prenatal stages, expression was
observed in mural cell-covered (Fig. 6A,A′, arrows) as well as mural cell-free
(Fig. 6A,A′,
arrowheads) arteries. Surprisingly, at P14 and later,
Msx1lacZ expression was detected in cells
resembling mural cells, since the β-gal-positive nuclei exhibited a rounder
shape and a more external position (Fig. 6B,B′). Furthermore, expression was now
restricted to mural cells-covered arteries. We analysed
Msx1lacZ expression until P150 and the
location and intensity of Xgal staining did not change with age (Fig. 6C,C′).

Fig. 6. Kinetics of Msx1lacZ expression in the
mouse choroid.
Flat-mounted choroids at P0, P14 and P150 were stained with Xgal
(blue), anti-α-SMA antibody (red) and Ib4
(green), demonstrating a broad expression of
Msx1lacZin choroidal vessels. At P0
(A,A′), Msx1-expressing cells seem to
be in a luminal position relative to α-SMA and to coincide with Ib4
labelling. At this stage, they are observed in vessels either covered
with α-SMA-positive cells (arrows) or not
(arrowheads). At P14 (B,B′),
Msx1lacZ expression is still strong
in the arterioles and major capillaries, but the β-gal-positive
nuclei look rounder and their position appears more to the exterior. At
P150 (C,C′), this pattern of expression in maintained.
In all panels, scale bar  = 50 µm.

To confirm the shift in expression of Msx1lacZ from
endothelial to mural cells, we performed a confocal analysis of choroid
transverse sections. At P0, the nuclear β-gal protein was observed in most
CD31-positive cells of the major arterioles (Fig. 7A, arrows). Clearly,
α-SMA-positive cells did not accumulate β-gal protein
(Fig. 7B,
arrowheads). At P21 the localization of β-gal had changed dramatically:
CD31-surrounded nuclei appeared completely devoid of β-gal protein
(Fig. 7C, arrows)
whereas α-SMA-positive cells expressed high levels of this protein
(Fig. 7D,
arrowheads). This change in pattern was observed in the whole choroid
vascular tree as shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 7. Dynamic expression of Msx1lacZ in the
choroidal vessels.
Immunofluorescence was performed on transverse sections of mouse
choroids. VSMCs were labelled for α-SMA (red), ECs for
CD31 (green) and Msx1lacZ
expression was revealed using anti-β-gal antibodies
(yellow). At P0, the β-gal protein can be observed in
CD31-expressing endothelial cells (A, arrows), α-SMA
expressing cells are completely negative for β-gal (B,
arrowheads). At P21, the endothelial CD31-positive cells do not
contain β-gal (C, arrows), in contrast to VSMCs that are
strongly labelled for β-gal (D, arrowheads). These results
reflect an EC-to-VSMC shift of Msx1lacZ
expression during the first three weeks after birth. In all panels,
scale bar  = 10 µm.

Discussion
Studying the different structures that compose the retina and choroid vasculature may
give insight into disease processes such as diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy,
hypertensive choroidopathy and macular degeneration. Taking advantage of
Msx1lacZ and
Msx2lacZ knock-in mice, we have established that
Msx1, but not Msx2, is expressed in the mouse
retinal and choroidal vasculature. One of the most striking results we obtained is
the specific expression of Msx1 in a cluster of ECs at primary, and
sometimes secondary, arteriolar branching sites in the retina. This property might
be more widespread in the peripheral vasculature. We previously reported that
Msx1 expression is more intense in arterioles of the thigh
muscle at branching sites (Goupille et al.,
2008). Our data suggested that expression took place in VSMCs, but
the situation should be revisited using confocal microscopy at these sites. The
expression pattern we observe in retina raises questions about the function
Msx1 may play and the mechanisms that might activate it at
branching sites.

Msx1 is unlikely to be associated with formation or stabilization of
retinal arteriole branches, since disruption of the Msx1 gene
specifically in the endothelium does not lead to defects in branching frequency or
branch stability. A function related to vessel physiology is therefore more likely.
In any case, Msx1 may be responding to specific signalling
molecules at these sites. The Notch pathway is of particular relevance to this
issue. The initial pattern of Jag1 expression in the retina is
different from that of Msx1, but at P15, Jag1-positive cells are
concentrated at branch points in arteries, in both endothelial and mural cells, in a
pattern strikingly similar to Msx1 (Hofmann and Luisa Iruela-Arispe, 2007). However,
Jag1 null mice die by E11.5 as a result of a lack of vascular
remodelling (Xue et al., 1999), a
phenotype very different from the one observed in Msx1 single or
Msx1; Msx2 double null mutant (Satokata et al., 2000; Lallemand et al., 2005). Furthermore, Notch signalling
plays a major role in controlling sprouting and at P6, in endothelium-specific
Jag1 mutants, the density of newly formed vessels at the
periphery of the retina is clearly reduced (Benedito et al., 2009). This phenotype was not observed in the
endothelium-specific mutation of Msx1 (Fig. 5C,F). Altogether, these considerations imply
that, if Msx1 is involved in the Notch pathway, it relays only a
fraction of Notch activity. Tie1, an endothelial-specific receptor
of the Tie receptor tyrosine kinase family with unknown ligand, is also expressed in
the retinal vessels, and further concentrated at branching sites (Porat et al., 2004). Other signalling
pathways, not yet characterized in the retinal vasculature, may play a role in
Msx1 expression.

Conspicuously, branching sites in retinal arterioles form specific structures, which
have been designated as arteriolar annuli (Henkind and De Oliveira, 1968; Simoens
et al., 1992). These are characterized by hypercellularity and
specific or enhanced expression of a number of genes. Among these are
α-Sma, Vimentin (Bandopadhyay et al., 2001) and
Jag1 (Hofmann and Luisa
Iruela-Arispe, 2007). Our own data confirm and extend these reports;
in particular, they demonstrate that mural cells at the branching sites express
NG2, the most characteristic marker of pericytes to date
(Ozerdem et al., 2001), and
simultaneously, α-Sma and calponin, which, in
mature retinal vasculature, are essentially restricted to VSMCs (Hughes and Chan-Ling, 2004). The basement
membrane, which is formed by a synergistic process between endothelial and mural
cells, is also modified at Msx1-expressing bifurcation points. A
higher density of basement membrane proteins such as versican (which was
detected by Ib4) and laminin is observed. Noticeably, Msx1
does not seem to play a role in endothelial secretion of basement membrane proteins
since Ib4 and laminin staining in Msx1 flox/ flox Msx2 flox/
flox Tie2Cre retinas is completely normal (data not
shown). Altogether, our data show that, in addition to mural cells, ECs at
branching sites also exhibit specific expression programs as assessed by
Msx1 expression.

Hyperaemia (i.e. the increase in blood perfusion associated with neural
activity), which is at the basis of functional neuroimaging (Magistretti and Pellerin, 1999), implies
mechanisms to regulate blood flow. These have been proposed to take place at the
precapillary level in the arteriole (Anderson
and McIntosh, 1967). However, the existence of a precapillary
sphincter in the retina at the junction between arterioles and capillaries is
controversial, has been poorly documented in recent years and the sphincter itself
not always rigorously defined (Friedman et al.,
1964; Anderson and McIntosh, 1967;
Wiedeman et al., 1976; Baez, 1977). From structural analyses, some
investigators reported its existence (Benjamin
et al., 1998; Ikebe et al.,
2001), while other could not detect it (Pannarale et al., 1996). Furthermore, theoretical and
experimental studies have shown that regulation of blood flow at the precapillary
level is unlikely to play a major role in the capillary filtration coefficient
(Bentzer et al., 2001; Boas et al., 2008). Functional analyses
indicate that flow regulation takes place over the whole capillary network, via a
coupling between astrocytes and blood vessels (Zonta et al., 2003; Cauli et al.,
2004; Metea and Newman, 2006;
Peppiatt et al., 2006). However, a
more recent functional study, based on laser speckle flowmetry, suggests that in the
retina, activity-dependent changes in blood flow are controlled largely by
arterioles and that capillaries contribute little to them, without documenting
specific structures responsible for this control (Srienc et al., 2010). Msx1 expression in
the retina is restricted to primary and secondary branching sites between arteries
and arterioles. At these sites, contraction-associated proteins are concentrated,
and it is plausible that Msx1 may play a role at the arteriolar
level in controlling blood flow.

Arteriolar annuli, and also Msx1 expression, could be linked to
mechanical constraints at branching sites. Vascular bifurcations are associated with
local modifications in rate and pattern of blood flow, including low wall and high
oscillatory shear stress (Zarins et al.,
1983). Noticeably, the ECs are primarily affected by shear stress,
as they are in direct contact with blood flow. Indeed, genes in the endothelium are
activated in response to shear stress (Andersson
et al., 2005; Ni et al.,
2010) via specific DNA responsive elements (Boon and Horrevoets, 2009). In addition, increased
hemodynamic stresses in vivo enhance smooth muscle cell coverage of
microvessels (Van Gieson et al.,
2003). Shear stress is not negligible in retina arteries and arterioles
(Ganesan et al., 2010), thus
Msx1 expression may be linked to blood flow at branching sites.
Noticeably, restriction of Msx1 expression at these sites
correlates with the onset of blood flow in the deeper vascular beds of the retina
(Stahl et al., 2010), which
might substantially change shear stress at bifurcations. It would be necessary to
perform arterial obstructive lesions in the retina to evaluate the relation between
blood flow and Msx1 expression.

Another intriguing result that we have obtained concerns the
Msx1lacZ pattern of expression in the choroid,
which shifts from endothelial to mural cells in the first three weeks of life
(Fig. 7). Previously, we
published that Msx1 is expressed in adult mouse VSMCs and pericytes
and, in the embryo, in ECs and VSMCs (Goupille
et al., 2008). However, we have never observed expression of
Msx1 in endothelial and mural cell populations in the same
vascular bed, either simultaneously or consecutively. Both cells types are regulated
by distinct mechanisms and Msx1 has been associated with a number
of different cells types in distinct developmental contexts. Therefore, we think
that Msx1 plays different and independent roles in the endothelial
and mural lineages. In addition, we should stress that, after P21, the
Msx1 pattern of expression observed in the choroid is quite
similar to the pattern observed in other peripheral arterioles and capillaries
(Goupille et al., 2008).

Materials and Methods
Mice
Generation of Msx1lacZ,
Msx2lacZ and
Msx2flox mutant mice has been described
previously (Houzelstein et al.,
1997; Lallemand et al., 2005;
Bensoussan et al., 2008). The
Msx1flox conditional mutant (Fu et al., 2007) was a generous gift
from Dr. Robert Maxson (Los Angeles, California, USA), the
Tie2-Cre transgenic mouse (Kisanuki et al., 2001), from Dr. Masashi Yanagisawa
(Dallas, Texas, USA). The α-Sm22Cre (Holtwick et al., 2002) and
RosamT/mG reporter mouse (Muzumdar et al., 2007) were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). All strains were
maintained on an NMRI outbred background. Genotyping primers were previously
described (Lopes et al., 2011).
Phenotypic analyses were conducted with mutant embryos using littermates as
controls. Animals were housed in the Institut Pasteur animal facilities
accredited by the French Ministry of Agriculture to perform experiments on live
mice (accreditation # B 75 15-05, issued on May 22, 2008), in
appliance of the French and European regulations on care and protection of the
Laboratory Animals (EC Directive 86/609, French Law 2001-486 issued on June
6, 2001). Protocols were approved by the veterinary staff of the Institut
Pasteur animal facility and were performed in compliance with the NIH Animal
Welfare Insurance #A5476-01 issued on 02/07/2007.

Processing of eye tissues
Eyes were collected at postnatal days 0 to 480 (P0-P480). Eyes were
enucleated and immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.2 (Sigma) for 5
to 30 min depending on mouse age. The cornea, lens, sclera, and vitreous
were excised by limbal incision under a dissecting microscope. For flat mount
preparation, retinas and choroids were detached and separated from the optic
nerve with fine forceps. Radial incisions were made towards their edges. The
flattened retinas were then washed with PBS and processed for β-gal activity
assay and immunohistochemistry. For transverse section analyses, the retinas and
choroids were not separated, instead they were immersed in 15% sucrose
and OCT compound (TissUE-Tek) before being frozen in liquid N2 and
cryostat-sectioned at 20 µm. Immunohistochemistry was performed as
described (Lopes et al.,
2011).

Xgal staining
Msx1lacZ and Msx2lacZ
genes expression was visualized by Xgal staining as described by (Houzelstein et al., 1997). After
staining, tissues were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h at room
temperature, then washed 3 times in PBS before immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry
Retinas were permeabilised with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and
50 mM NH4Cl for 30 min. Tissues were washed 3 times in PBS then
treated for 1 h with blocking buffer (1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
CaCl2, 10% goat serum and 0.5% Tween-20 in
PBS). The same blocking solution was used for incubation with primary
antibodies overnight at 4°C under gentle agitation. Primary antibodies are
listed in Table 1. The retinas
were washed four times for 5 min with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS,
incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer.
Secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse
and goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 647 goat
anti-mouse, Alexa Fluor 635 goat anti-rabbit at 1/300 and Alexa Fluor 488
streptavidin at 1/1000. Retinas were washed again three times for 5 min
with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS, followed by incubation with
2.5 µg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (bisBenzimide trihydrochloride,
Sigma) in PBS for 15 min to label nuclei. They were finally washed
in PBS and two times in water and flat mounted with Dako mounting medium.

Table 1. Primary antibodies used in this study.
Microscopy of retinal and choroid whole-mounts
Whole-mount retinas were primarily observed under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence
microscope, and a Zeiss Axioplan equipped with an Apotome, and analysed with the
Axiovison software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Co-localizations were
performed with a confocal microscope Zeiss LSM 700 equipped with the Zen
software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). All captured images were
assembled using Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems, San
Jose, CA, USA). For quantitative analyses, one-way ANOVA was used to
compare independent experiments. Comparison between data groups was performed
with the non-parametric Dunnett test.
