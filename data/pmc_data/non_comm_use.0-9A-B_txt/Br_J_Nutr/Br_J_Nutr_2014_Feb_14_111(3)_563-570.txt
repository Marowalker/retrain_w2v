To investigate whether obese women can compensate for sucrose added to the diet
when it is given blind, rather than gaining weight or exhibiting dysfunctional
regulation of intake, in the present study, forty-one healthy obese (BMI
30–35 kg/m2) women (age 20–50
years), not currently dieting, were randomly assigned to consume sucrose
(n 20) or aspartame (n 21) drinks over 4
weeks in a parallel single-blind design. Over the 4 weeks, one group
consumed 4 × 250 ml sucrose drinks
(total 1800 kJ/d) and the other group consumed
4 × 250 ml aspartame drinks. During
the baseline week and experimental weeks, body weight and other biometric data
were measured and steps per day, food intake using 7 d unweighed food
diaries, and mood using ten- or seven-point Likert scales four times a day were
recorded. At the end of the experiment, the participants weighed 1·72
(se 0·47) kg less than the value predicted by
the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
model; the predicted body weight accounted for 94·3 % of
the variance in the observed body weight and experimental group accounted for a
further 1·1 % of the variance in the observed body weight,
showing that women consuming sucrose drinks gained significantly less weight
than predicted. The reported daily energy intake did not increase significantly,
and sucrose supplements significantly reduced the reported voluntary sugar,
starch and fat intake compared with aspartame. There were no effects on appetite
or mood. Over 4 weeks, as part of everyday eating, sucrose given blind in soft
drinks was partially compensated for by obese women, as in previous experiments
with healthy and overweight participants.

==== Body
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has concluded that ‘Among free
living people involving ad libitum diets, intake of free sugars or
sugar sweetened beverages is a determinant of body weight’(

1

). It may be particularly difficult to accurately compensate for energy-dense
liquids that lack visual or orosensory cues to their energy content(

2

,

3

). It has also been hypothesised that compensation when participants know
that they are being given sugars differs from that when they are given sugars
blind(

4

,

5

). In the former conditions, psychological expectancy effects are more likely
to occur, such as abstinence violation effects(

6

,

7

), meaning that sugars can have both direct effects on energy intake and
indirect effects by being the marker and sign of a less-healthy lifestyle that may
include inactivity and surplus energy intake from all sources, notably from fat.

Studies that encourage reductions in the intake of sugars cannot be blind, and
participants deliberately choose foods, making it difficult to differentiate the direct
effects of sugar consumption from indirect effects. In studies in which isoenergetic
high-sugar or low-sugar diets are given, sometimes under blind conditions, no difference
in weight status can be found(

1

). In short, the impact of sugars in the diet depends upon what else people
eat(

1

) and overall energy balance(

2

). It is not clear whether obese people differ qualitatively, or only
quantitatively, in their regulation of eating from people who weigh less(

8

). There have been few randomised controlled studies carried out in obese
participants deliberately increasing sugar intake in the ad libitum
diet(

1

), which was the purpose of the experiment reported herein.

In this line of research, two previous studies gave supplements of 1800 kJ of
sucrose as liquid for normal-weight and overweight women under single-blind conditions
over 4 weeks and found that women partially compensated for the added energy by reducing
ad libitum intake elsewhere in the diet(

4

,

5

). The participants did not gain weight over the course of the experiments.
It was concluded that when given blind to eliminate psychological expectancy effects,
women compensate for sucrose added to the diet in soft drinks. The present experiment
replicates this procedure using obese participants.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of sucrose beverages consumed
over 4 weeks when compared with a placebo containing artificial sweeteners in obese
women. Previous studies(

4

,

5

) found no effects of labelling, so in the present study, all the
participants were informed that they were being given sucrose-sweetened soft drinks,
meaning that half of the participants were misinformed, as they were actually being
given artificially sweetened ones.

The present experiment extends the previous experimental design to women who are obese
(BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The hypothesis was that
obese women, similar to overweight and normal-weight women in previous studies, would
partially compensate for the energy content of supplementary soft drinks: (1) not gain
weight, the primary outcome measure based on body weight; secondary outcomes being (2)
reduce energy intake elsewhere in the diet, (3) reduce the total fat content of the
diet, as in the previous experiments, and (4) reduce the ad libitum
carbohydrate (CHO) content of the diet, measured by the self-reported food intake in the
food diaries. Drinks rather than solid foods were used for convenience and because
sugary drinks are the form of simple CHO most likely to cause the effects discussed
above.

Methods
Design
The present experiment was carried out over a period of 5 weeks: baseline data
were collected for 1 week and supplementary drinks were added to the diet for 4
weeks. On the basis of previous research(

5

), a target cell size of twenty-two was calculated to achieve a
90 % chance of detecting a difference in change in the body weight of
1·5 % of baseline body weight between the groups (assuming
sd= 1·5). The subjects were given
drinks containing sucrose (achieved n 20) or drinks containing
aspartame (with minimal energy content, achieved n 21). All the
subjects were informed that they were being given sugar-sweetened drinks.

Ethics
The experiment was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were
approved by the ethics committee of Queen Margaret University. Written informed
consent was obtained from all the participants. The study was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01799096). The following significant ethical issues were
recognised: first, giving obese people sucrose could possibly have adverse
effects on their weight or diet, but the null results of previous studies
minimised this risk; second, monitoring the diets of obese people introduced a
requirement of care, which was satisfied by providing detailed feedback about
dietary intake and potential ways of improving it at the end of the experiment,
and this also served as an additional incentive to participate; lastly, the
experiment involved deception, so all the participants were informed about the
reasons for this at the end of the experiment.

Participants
Participants were recruited by advertising around local universities and
businesses. They included university staff, mature students and members of the
general public. Volunteers were screened via telephone interviews. Inclusion
criteria included being a woman with a BMI between 30 and
35 kg/m2 and aged between 20 and 55 years with at
least one period of dietary restriction of 4 weeks or more in the last 24
months, but not in the last 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included a dislike for
popular sweet carbonated drinks, dieting in the last month, history of diabetes,
having an eating disorder, being currently treated for depression or scoring
>10 on the Beck Depression Inventory II(

9

), being a smoker, pregnant or lactating, wearing a pacemaker, and
currently taking medication for mood or thyroid disorders. A pin-prick method
using the Accu-Chek GC was used to measure blood glucose levels. Fasting blood
glucose levels ≥ 11 mmol/l were determined as
abnormal, and individuals with these levels were not permitted to participate in
the study. A screening questionnaire was also used to detect individuals with
diabetes symptoms. In fact, nobody with diabetes symptoms was detected.

Of the eighty-five women screened, forty-one were excluded: for having a BMI
>35 kg/m2 (n 5) or a BMI
< 30 kg/m2 (n
30), currently lactating (n 1), receiving antidepressant
treatment (n 3) or having a thyroid disorder
(n 2). A further three participants withdrew during the
baseline week, giving an achieved sample size of forty-one (age 35 (sd
9·1) years). The participants were assigned alternately to two groups
after screening. The participants who withdrew were replaced by the next
available participant. This method of assignment was used instead of random
assignment because recruitment to previous studies was difficult, given the
exclusion criteria and duration of the experiment. It was important that early
recruiters and later recruiters (who might differ, for instance, in terms of
eagerness to volunteer) be assigned evenly to the two groups. As nobody dropped
out of the experiment during the intervention phase, an intention-to-treat
analysis was unnecessary. The participants were given a disturbance allowance of
£100 (£20 per week), to provide a limited, but not
compelling, incentive for participation.

Experimental drinks
Each participant was given four 250 ml bottles per d for 4 weeks
(daily total 1800 kJ; 105 g CHO). The sucrose-sweetened
Irn Bru (per 100 ml) contained 180 kJ,
10·5 g CHO and 0·35 mg Fe with
traces of protein and fat. The diet Irn Bru contained
17 kJ/100 ml and traces of CHO, with no protein, fat or
Fe. The amount to be consumed was chosen as 1000 ml/d on the basis of
the ethical approval process in our earlier studies (Reid et
al., 2007(

4

)), as it was found to be the minimum amount to have an effect on
dietary intake and have ecological validity without posing ethical and practical
difficulties. In 2012, the consumption of carbonated soft drinks amounted to
102·6 litres per head(

10

), 281 ml/d, in the UK, although some consumers drink
substantially more than this(

11

).

Experimental measures
Physical measures
Digital scales (Soehnle) were used to measure weight to the nearest
0·1 kg, and a stadiometer (model no. 220; SECA) was
used to measure height to the nearest 0·1 cm. Using
standardised callipers, skinfold thickness was measured around the abdomen
(suprailiac) just above the iliac crest. Waist circumference was measured to
the nearest 0·1 inch using a standardised measuring tape.
Subsequently, the volunteers rested on a bed for 5 min before
body measurements were taken using the Bodystat®1500
bioimpedance machine (Bodystat Limited). The bioimpedance machine was used
to measure body fat, water and lean mass, BMI, BMR (in kJ), estimated
average requirement and impedance. The BMR (at rest) was estimated using the
Brozek and Grande formula. This formula is based on the lean weight of a
subject and not on total body weight.

Food, mood and activity diary
Each volunteer was given an electronic pedometer (Digi-Walker; Yamax) and
instructions on how to use it. Accordingly, the participants were asked to
record the number of steps that they walked each day in their diaries before
bedtime. For each week, the mean number of total daily steps was calculated.
From this number, activity levels were estimated, where
< 5000 steps indicate sedentary, 5000–7499
steps low active, 7500–9999 steps somewhat active, and
10 000+ steps active(

12

). For entry into the simulation model(

13

), these categories were coded as activity levels 1·4,
1·6, 1·8 and 2·0, respectively.

The 7 d unweighed prospective diary used in the present experiment
was similar to that used previously in similar experiments(

4

,

5

). The participants were required to record all foods and drinks
consumed by them as accurately as possible in hourly time slots. To improve
accuracy, all the participants were trained in the use of the diary,
including the use of appropriate detailed descriptions of foods, using food
atlases showing portion sizes for reference(

14

) and using labelling and packaging information for data entry.
Moreover, the experimenter (M. D.) is a trained nutritionist and each week
along with the participants, she reviewed and corrected their diaries to
maximise accuracy by checking portion sizes, eliciting further details of
the foods actually eaten, checking periods when the participants seemed to
have eaten little or nothing and checking that they had remembered to record
snacks and drinks consumed. To further enhance compliance, the participants
were given a brief individual dietary report at the end of the experiment,
based on their data. Mood and activity levels were also recorded in the
diary. Mood was measured four times a day using ten- or seven-point bipolar
Likert scales designed to comprehensively assess the main dimensions of
subjective state (happy–sad; angry–calm;
anxious–composed; disgusted–satisfied;
tired–energetic; restless–relaxed;
hungry–full; thirsty–not thirsty;
intoxicated–sober; ill–well).

Procedure
Further details of the questionnaire are available elsewhere(

4

). The eligible volunteers visited the laboratory six times over
5 weeks: during the initial screening interview, at the start of each
intervention week and at the end of the last intervention week. During the
initial screening interview, height and weight were recorded, and the
subjects were screened for eating disorders and depression using standard
criteria with the Beck Depression Inventory II(

9

) and the Eating Disorder Inventory(

15

).

As well as verbal information, the volunteers were given an information sheet
about the experiment. The subjects were told that the purpose of the
experiment was to examine the effects of certain nutrients in soft drinks on
people's psychological well-being. They were informed that the
drinks provided would be similar in taste to commercial soft drinks such as
Irn Bru and Tizer, but that the drinks had been prepared especially for the
experiment. The drinks were actually Irn Bru in plastic bottles with the
replacement labels removed and the caps painted a uniform colour. Although
artificially sweetened and sucrose soft drinks taste similar, they are
discriminable in simultaneous taste comparisons. The participants were given
only one type of drink, and they were instructed not to compare theirs with
that of other participants in order to maintain the integrity of the
experiment. Most participants were unknown to each other. Those eligible
participated after the screening session on the basis of informed consent,
which included consent to drinking beverages that may or may not contain
sucrose.

A taste test was then conducted with a rating form to exclude anyone who
disliked drinks of the type to be given. Biometric baseline measurements,
including skinfold thickness, waist circumference and bioelectrical
impedance measurements, were taken in those still eligible. They were also
given a 7 d food diary and a food atlas to record their dietary
intake for the baseline week before the experiment. The experimenter spent
approximately 30 min training each subject on the accurate
completion of the diary (see below).

After recording baseline data, the subjects returned on the following Monday
or Tuesday morning each week to keep the weekend constant within each
7 d test period. During these visits, the diaries of the subjects
were checked for any ambiguities or missing data, and if necessary, the
subjects were given further training on the completion of the diary.
Anthropometric measurements were again taken at each visit together with a
saliva swab. The participants were told that the experimenter could tell the
extent to which they had been consuming the test drinks from the saliva
sample, which was in fact discarded. This is an example of a
‘bogus pipeline’, which improves compliance(

16

). The participants also discussed any perceived effects of
consuming the soft drinks and any difficulties that they had experienced on
drinking them on schedule. The participants were then given their supply of
drinks for the week and were informed to consume the specified amount each
day at 11.00, 14.00, 18.00 and 20.00 hours. The subjects rated
their mood directly after consuming the drinks in their 7 d food
and mood diaries every day. They were instructed to keep the unopened
bottles in a refrigerator or in a cool place.

The same procedure was repeated on the following three Monday or Tuesday
mornings. Throughout each 7 d period, the subjects were asked to
report to the experimenter any problems or symptoms that they felt might be
related to the consumption of the soft drinks. At the end of week 4, the
subjects returned one last time to the laboratory, when final measurements
were taken and diaries were collected.

At the end of the 5-week experiment, written and verbal dietary feedback was
provided and a disturbance allowance was given to those who completed the
experiment. The subjects were debriefed about the nature and purpose of the
study, including explanation of the deceptions involved.

Statistical analyses
Data collected during baseline (week 0) and weeks 1 and 4 of the intervention
were compared; data collected during weeks 2 and 3 were not used, as they
assessed neither hypothetical early changes in dietary compensation nor final
outcome. Possible differences in baseline anthropometric, dietary and
psychological variables between the groups were assessed using independent
t tests. Using Shapiro–Wilk tests, all the
variables entered into the main analyses were found to be normally distributed.
Body weight at the end of the intervention was analysed with linear regression
modelling to compare the observed body weight with the predicted body weight
(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) model)
and intervention group. Differences in dietary variables were examined using
general linear modelling with the following design: two between (sucrose or
aspartame drink groups) by three repeated (baseline, week 1 and week 4) measures
with waist circumference as a covariate. In this design, an effect of sucrose
would be shown by a significant week × group
interaction.

The assessment of mood data was carried out using a general linear modelling
repeated-measures design using time of day and week as repeated measures, with
type of drink and expectancy as fixed variables. Where sphericity tests failed,
this was noted; otherwise, results are reported by assuming sphericity. Where
appropriate, post hoc comparisons were made using
t tests. All analyses were carried out using SPSS versions 16
and 19 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., IBM).

Results

Table 1 summarises the selected baseline
data for the two groups. Similar to that observed in previous studies, the
experimental manipulation had no effect on mood, and mood data are not reported here
further. The only significant difference between the groups at baseline was with
regard to waist circumference (t(39
df) = 2·53,
P< 0·05), so waist circumference
was included as a covariate in all ANOVA, but its effects were never significant and
are not reported. Table 1 also summarises
the reported and predicted energy intake (NIDDK model(

13

)). It can be seen that only a mean of 79 % of the predicted
energy intake was reported. Moreover, the mean disparity between the predicted and
reported intake was larger (2598 kJ) than the value of the intervention
(1800 kJ). However, 19·5 % of the sample reported
consuming more than 100 % of the value predicted, so there was no uniform
under-reporting.Table 1 Selected data at baseline for the experimental and control groups (Mean

Body weight
For each participant, the predicted body weight was calculated using the NIDDK
model(

13

), assuming that the sucrose group consumed an additional
1800 kJ/d, with no change in activity levels, and that the aspartame
group changed neither their diet nor their activity (i.e. predicted body weight
was the same as that at baseline). Fig. 1
shows the plots of the predicted and observed body weight at the end of week 4.
In the aspartame group, there was a highly significant correlation between the
predicted and observed body weight (r 0·988,
P< 0·001). In the sucrose
group also, there was a highly significant correlation (r
0·956, P< 0·001),
but this was slightly lower than that observed in the aspartame group. It can be
seen in Fig. 1 that approximately
two-thirds of the sucrose group (14/20) weighed less than the value predicted,
but this applied to fewer individuals (n 11/21) of the
aspartame group. A linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the
observed body weight from the predicted body weight (entered in step 1) and
experimental group (entered in step 2). The predicted body weight accounted for
94·3 % of the variance in the observed body weight
(F(1,39
df) = 659·80,
P< 0·0001), while experimental
group accounted for a further 1·1 % of the variance in the
observed body weight
(F(1,38) = 9·15,
P< 0·001). The arithmetic
difference between the predicted and observed body weight was calculated, and
the sucrose and aspartame groups were compared using a between-group
t test. The groups differed significantly (sucrose
1·71 (sd 2·09) kg; aspartame
− 0·31 (sd
1·71) kg; t(39
df) = 3·40,
P< 0·005), confirming that the
observed weight of the aspartame group was very close to the predicted
(baseline) value. The differences between the baseline weight and the observed
end weight were compared for the aspartame group using a paired
t test, confirming that there was no significant change in
weight (t(20
df) = 0·842,
P= 0·41), so they had not
reduced voluntary food intake because they expected to receive sugars.Fig. 1 Predicted body weight (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) model) and observed weight at the end of
the experiment. Drinks given over 28 d: , sucrose; , aspartame. (A
colour version of this figure can be found online at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bjn)




Additionally, the data on the predicted and observed weight at the end of the
intervention were compared with the data obtained from the two earlier
experiments carried out in normal-weight and overweight women(

4

,

5

), as shown in Fig. 2. It can
be seen that across all the three experiments, the observed weight tended to be
lower than the predicted weight for women given sucrose, indicating that partial
compensation had occurred.Fig. 2 Predicted body weight (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) model) and observed weight at the end of
the three experiments with healthy-weight, overweight and obese
participants. Drinks given over 28 d: , sucrose; , aspartame. (A
colour version of this figure can be found online at http://www.journals.cambridge.org/bjn)




A linear regression analysis was conducted to predict the observed body weight
from the predicted body weight (entered in step 1), experimental group (entered
in step 2) and study (entered in step 3). For this analysis, study was
dummy-coded into two binary variables of healthy weight/not healthy weight and
obese/not obese. The predicted body weight indicated
98·6 % of the variance in the observed body weight
(F(1,225) = 16 416·87,
P< 0·0001). Experimental
group predicted only a further 0·4 % of the variance, but
this was significant
(F(1,224) = 81·40,
P< 0·0001). Study had a
further significant effect
(F(1,222) = 3·77,
P< 0·05), but predicted
less than 0·1 % of the variance. Fig. 2 shows that there is no clear trend for compensation
to vary as a function of initial weight. Looking at the means for women who were
given sucrose in the three experiments, healthy-weight women compensated by
1·87 (sd 0·13) kg that they did not
gain and overweight women compensated by 1·32 (sd
0·27) kg, while obese women compensated by 1·72
(sd 0·47) kg. So, overweight women
compensated least well, but the standard error for obese women was approximately
twice that for the other participants, showing more variability. To address the
question of whether weight change after sucrose consumption differed between the
groups, a one-way ANOVA on weight change (observed end
weight − baseline weight) was conducted only
for the participants who were given sucrose, with study (healthy, overweight and
obese) as the independent variable. There was no effect of study
(F(2,109) = 1·46,
P= 0·236).

On comparing the difference between the predicted and observed body weight, as
discussed above, it was found that the observed body weight of the sucrose group
differed significantly from the predicted value (sucrose 1·72
(sd 1·37); aspartame 0·16 (sd
1·27); t(225
df) = 8·93,
P< 0·0001). As in the present
experiment, combining all three experiments the aspartame group's
weight had not changed since baseline by paired t test
(t(114
df) = − 1·373,
P= 0·17).

Dietary intake data

Table 2 summaries the mean reported
daily macronutrient intake over the course of the experiment. Data are reported
as g/d and include the supplementary drinks. Analyses were conducted by
including the supplements to demonstrate that the participants had consumed the
drinks and by excluding the supplements to ascertain the extent of compensation
for the supplements elsewhere in the diet.Table 2 Reported macronutrient composition of the diet over the course of the

Dietary intake including the supplement
The mean reported daily dietary energy intake did not change over the weeks
(F(2,76) = 1·15,
P= 0·32) and there was no
group × week interaction
(F(2,76) = 2·49,
P= 0·09), indicating that
the supplementary drinks did not significantly affect the reported energy
intake.

For grams of total sugars ingested, there was no main effect of week
(F(2,76) = 1·5,
P= 0·23), but there was a
large week × group interaction
(F(2,76) = 23·6,
P< 0·0001), indicating
that, as one would expect, the supplementary sucrose drinks increased sugar
intake. In subsequent analyses, the effects of the drink supplements on
voluntary intake excluding the supplements were examined more thoroughly.

Voluntary carbohydrate intake excluding the supplement
Because the supplements contained sucrose, voluntary total sugar intake and
voluntary starch intake were analysed separately. For the percentage of energy
obtained from total sugars, there were no main effects of group
(F(1,38) = 2·94,
P= 0·09) or week
(F(2,76) = 0·36,
P= 0·70), but there was a
significant week × group interaction
(F(2,76) = 4·87,
P< 0·05). For the
percentage of energy obtained from starch, sphericity could not be assumed
(W(2
df) = 0·60,
P< 0·001). Similar to that
observed for total sugars, there were no main effects of group
(F(1,38) = 0·84,
P= 0·37) or week
(F(2,76) = 2·94,
P= 0·07), but, again,
there was a significant week × group
interaction
(F(2,76) = 6·03,
P< 0·01).

Because the effects were similar for sugars and starches, post
hoc analyses were used to examine the voluntary intake of CHO (sugars
plus starches): participants given the sucrose supplement significantly
decreased their voluntary intake of CHO by 23 % (mean reduction
31 g CHO, 29 % of the supplement, range 129 g
reduction–208 g increase) at week 1 (t(19
df) = 5·77,
P< 0·001) and by
27 % (mean reduction 59 g, 56 % of the
supplement, range 208 g reduction–88 g
increase) at week 4 (t(19
df) = 14·30,
P< 0·001) compared with that
at baseline. In the aspartame group, there was a 4 % decrease
(non-significant) in CHO intake at week 1 and an 18 % decrease at
week 4 (t(20 df) = 19·98,
P< 0·001) compared with
that at baseline.

Protein intake
For the percentage of energy obtained from protein, there was a main effect of
group
(F(1,38) = 5·69,
P< 0·05), but no effect of
week
(F(2,76) = 0·49,
P= 0·61) and no
interaction
(F(2,76) = 2·43,
P= 0·10). Using
independent groups t tests, it was found that the groups did
not differ in the percentage of energy obtained from protein at baseline
(t(39
df) = 0·65,
P= 0·52), but that they
differed at week 1 (t(39
df) = 2·61,
P< 0·05) and week 4
(t(39 df) = 3·38,
P< 0·005). Using paired
t tests, it was found that in the sucrose group, the
percentage of energy obtained from protein at week 1 (t(19
df) = 2·37,
P< 0·05) and week 4
(t(19 df) = 3·76,
P< 0·001) was reduced
compared with that at baseline. This was not the case in the aspartame
group.

Fat intake
The percentage of energy obtained from fat did not vary by week
(F(2,76) = 1·81,
P= 0·17), but there was a
small effect of group
(F(1,38) = 5·97,
P< 0·05), because the
percentage of energy obtained from fat was reduced in the sucrose group. There
was no week × group interaction
(F(2,76) = 1·97,
P= 0·15).

Hunger and thirst
Hunger and thirst were rated four times daily as part of the mood rating
procedure. Because of substantial individual differences in scale use, ratings
were converted to z-scores, using the grand mean of all ratings
for each subject, and then the means of four ratings across 7 d were
computed across the baseline week and week 4. Paired t tests
were carried out separately for each drink, comparing baseline hunger and thirst
with hunger and thirst after 4 weeks of the experiment. There were no
differences in the rated hunger or thirst.

Discussion
The present experiment carried out in obese women replicates earlier findings on
normal-weight and overweight women; however, the use of the NIDDK model(

13

) allowed more precise estimation of the magnitude of compensation: obese
women who were given 1800 kJ sucrose per d in soft drinks for 4 weeks
gained a mean of 1·72 kg less than the value predicted by the
model. Weight did not change any more than that observed in previous studies with
normal-weight and overweight participants. The reported energy intake, including the
supplement, did not change. The reported voluntary intake of CHO of the participants
was reduced to as much as 27 % of the energy value of the supplement by
week 4 of the intervention. The reported fat and protein intake was also reduced.
There were no effects on mood, hunger or thirst. There was no significant weight
change in the group given aspartame, suggesting that any deliberate attempts to
refrain from consuming the diet in case the drinks contained sugar were ineffective.

Study limitations
The present study has at least four limitations. First, dietary intake recorded
in the unweighed diaries was poorly related to the energy expenditure estimated
using the NIDDK model(

13

), suggesting about 21 % under-reporting. Consequently, it
is important to avoid overinterpreting the self-reported dietary intake data.
Second, there were some differences between the results of the present
experiment and those of earlier experiments(

4

,

5

), with the reported compensation being smaller and individual
differences being larger. The participants may have altered their behaviour in
response to the experimental intervention. Self-monitoring is important for the
weight control of obese people(

17

), and taking part in a study monitoring dietary behaviour may have
had a generic influence on behaviour. Thus, the present experiment does not show
that obese people compensate identically to healthy-weight people.

Third, the participants may simply have avoided drinking some or all the
supplementary drinks, despite regular monitoring and the bogus pipeline.
However, the fact that overall CHO intake increased only in the sucrose group
suggests adequate compliance. Lastly, sweetness may have reduced energy intake
in both conditions. However, while there is some evidence that sweetness
increases short-term satiety(

18

), the limited evidence suggests that, if anything, in the long term
the consumption of sweet drinks leads to weight gain(

19

), which was not the case in the present study for either the sucrose
or the aspartame group.

Generalisability
The findings of the present study apply only to those experiments where sucrose
is added to the diet blind, with the diet being monitored. If some participants
were restraining voluntary consumption because their diets were being monitored,
then liberal use of sucrose in the unmonitored diet might not be compensated for
so well. The soft drinks used in the present experiment were sucrose sweetened
as is common in the UK, rather than being sweetened with high-fructose maize
syrup, as is common in the USA. Specific concerns about fructose and obesity
remain, although they may have been overstated(

20

).

Implications
Generally, obese women were able to compensate for the addition of sucrose to the
diet by mainly reducing CHO intake. Although these effects were relatively small
and the experiment is limited in other ways, the present study suggests that the
cognitive control of eating in obesity is important. Expectancy effects may play
a role in failures to compensate for sucrose, hence in any consequent weight
gain.

Partially controlling psychological expectancy effects, by giving sucrose blind,
reduces the chances of people being affected by cognitive factors, which may be
important for determining the effects of sugars in everyday life. The accepted
cognitive factors include the emotional valence of food(

21

), which may be associated with eating binges; interactions between
expectancy, orosensory experience, and satiety(

2

,

3

); the abstinence violation effect(

6

) that having eaten a restricted food, one may as well eat more;
outcome expectancy effects(

22

), so that people's behaviour after eating sugars is in
accordance with the expectation that it leads to sugar craving and more
consumption; and experimental (or social) demand characteristics(

23

), so that participants tend to behave as the experiment (or social
setting) suggests that they should behave.

If under controlled conditions people partially compensate for sucrose added to
the diet, then there is a need for more research on what people think and what
they feel about sugars, and it is premature to consider sucrose to be
exceptionally problematic for weight management. Indeed, widely publicised
warnings about sugars(

24

,

25

) may make cognitive factors more likely to support dysregulation of
energy intake, perpetuating the everyday weight management problems that the
warnings are supposed to address.

Conclusions
The present study demonstrates that obese women partially compensate for sucrose
added blind to the diet over 4 weeks and do not gain weight. Their response is
not fundamentally different from the response of normal-weight and overweight
women observed in earlier studies, despite concerns that obese people regulate
diet differently, or more poorly, compared with normal-weight people. If
cognitive factors are important determinants of dietary compensation, then there
is a need for an improved understanding of how cognition interacts with
physiological mechanisms of appetite regulation.
