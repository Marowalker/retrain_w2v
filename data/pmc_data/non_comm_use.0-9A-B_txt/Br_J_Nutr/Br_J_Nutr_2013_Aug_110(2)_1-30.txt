of the major exogenous factors modulating different aspects of immune function. Currently,
no single marker is available to predict the effect of a dietary intervention on different
aspects of immune function. To provide further guidance on the assessment and
interpretation of the modulation of immune functions due to nutrition in the general
population, International Life Sciences Institute Europe commissioned a group of experts
from academia, government and the food industry to prepare a guidance document. A draft of
this paper was refined at a workshop involving additional experts. First, the expert group
defined criteria to evaluate the usefulness of immune function markers. Over seventy-five
markers were scored within the context of three distinct immune system functions: defence
against pathogens; avoidance or mitigation of allergy; control of low-grade (metabolic)
inflammation. The most useful markers were subsequently classified depending on whether
they by themselves signify clinical relevance and/or involvement of immune function. Next,
five theoretical scenarios were drafted describing potential changes in the values of
markers compared with a relevant reference range. Finally, all elements were combined,
providing a framework to aid the design and interpretation of studies assessing the
effects of nutrition on immune function. This stepwise approach offers a clear rationale
for selecting markers for future trials and provides a framework for the interpretation of
outcomes. A similar stepwise approach may also be useful to rationalise the selection and
interpretation of markers for other physiological processes critical to the maintenance of
health and well-being.

==== Body
The overall aim of this article is to provide further guidance for the assessment and
interpretation of immune modulation by nutrition in the general population. To this end, the
European Branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) established a group of
experts from academia, government and the food industry to agree upon criteria to evaluate the
usefulness of immune function markers in a structured manner. Over seventy-five markers were
scored and evaluated within the context of three distinct domains of immune function: defence
against pathogens; avoidance or mitigation of allergy; control of low-grade inflammation
mainly focusing on metabolic inflammation. Other aspects of immune function such as
autoimmunity and surveillance against tumours were not included at this stage. The most useful
markers were classified depending on whether they by themselves demonstrate clinical relevance
and/or involvement of immune function. In addition, five theoretical scenarios were drafted
describing potential changes in the values of markers compared with a relevant reference
range. These include (significant) modulation within the reference range (a very common
scenario for modulation due to nutrition), modulation from outside the reference range back
into the range, modulation from within the reference range out of the range, prevention of
modulation induced by other factors, and modulation from a less favourable range to the
reference range of a comparator group with a more desired immune function (e.g. from
bottle-fed to breast-fed infants). Finally, the expert group combined all of the
above-mentioned information, providing a framework to aid the design and interpretation of
studies assessing the effects of nutrition on immune function. An early draft of this report
was discussed with a wider group of experts at a workshop held in Nice, France, 16–17 April
2012. Additional information about the workshop discussions and participants is available on
the ILSI Europe website (http://www.ilsi.org/Europe/Pages/HomePage.aspx).

The main function of the immune system is to help maintain homeostasis by providing
protection against infections. On the other hand, inappropriate or improperly controlled
immune functions contribute to pathophysiological processes such as allergic manifestations
and chronic inflammatory responses. Development and maintenance of a normal immune system are
thus essential for a healthy and active life. Functioning of the immune system is influenced
by a variety of inherited, environmental, behavioural, social and individual factors(

1

). Therefore, it is no surprise that solutions to help develop, restore or optimise
immune functions are much sought after by scientists, consumers and industry alike.

One of the major modifiable factors affecting immune function is nutrition (the primary
factor being vaccination); undernutrition is often related to decreased immune function,
whereas overnutrition and obesity can contribute to chronic low-grade inflammatory changes.
Whole diets, individual nutrients and food components such as phytochemicals, prebiotics and
probiotics have all been shown to influence distinct aspects of the immune system. These
effects have been reviewed extensively in a number of recent papers(

2

–

21

). Several other papers have provided some guidance on how best to assess specific
immune functions and which confounding factors and methodological aspects to consider(

1

,

18

,

22

–

28

). Moreover, the European Food Safety Authority panel on dietetic products,
nutrition and allergies has recently issued a guidance document on the scientific requirements
for the substantiation of health claims related to gut and immune function(

29

). This document offers an excellent starting point for the assessment and
interpretation of immune modulation by nutrition. However, some critical elements are still
missing, and especially when focusing on the assessment and optimisation of immune function in
the general population, some questions remain largely unanswered. These include the following:
(1) How can ‘optimal immune function(s)’ be identified and characterised? (2) Which markers
are most informative to describe (optimal) immune function(s)? (3) How can changes in the
values of these markers be interpreted? (a) Can immune function(s) in a general population be
optimised? (b) How to assess improved immune function(s)? (c) How to identify risk associated
with the modulation of immune function(s)?

This article aims to provide some further guidance on these aspects by providing criteria for
the selection of immune function markers, ranked lists of markers that best describe the
(modulation of) specific immune functions in the general population, reference to normal
values and ranges established in laboratory medicine and daily clinical practice for selected
markers, and rational approaches for the design of studies, selection of markers and
interpretation of changes observed in these markers due to exogenous factors such as
nutrition.

Paradigm relating immune function to health
The basic paradigm of the relationship between immune function and health is illustrated in
Fig. 1. Regardless of the marker or assay used,
immune functions vary between subjects and they fluctuate over time within a subject. In a
healthy population, these fluctuations define the boundaries of a ‘normal range’, and immune
function(s) within this ‘homeodynamic bandwidth’ are postulated to support the maintenance
of ‘optimal health’. Genetic make-up and past experiences contribute to differences between
subjects, and environmental or lifestyle-associated factors can temporarily or permanently
move specific immune function(s) outside these ranges, thus failing to support optimal
health. If this is sustained or becomes more extreme, it may contribute to pathogenic
processes and modify disease risk. Within this paradigm, optimising immune function
encompasses the return of such function(s) back into the normal range and/or strengthening
of the resilience of the function(s), thus reducing the amplitude of fluctuations and
reinforcing the homeodynamic regulation within the optimal range(

2

,

30

). Consequently, at times, it may be beneficial to down-regulate hyperactive
immune functions or up-regulate hypoactive immune functions or to strengthen the resilience
of immune functions to respond to external ‘stressors’.Fig. 1 Illustration of the general paradigm postulating that fluctuations within the
boundaries of a normal range support the maintenance of optimal health. Regardless of
the marker or assay used, immune functions vary between subjects and they fluctuate
within subjects over time (), although apparently
within some normal limits (green zone) that may be individually defined. Certain
(combinations of) factors can drive immune function(s) to a state of hypo- or
hyperactivity (). The objective of a
(nutritional) intervention is to restore functions to the normal range
() and/or to strengthen the resilience of these function(s),
reducing the amplitude of fluctuations and thus reinforcing the homeodynamic
regulation within the normal range. Adapted from Hamer et al.

Brief overview of major immune functions
The immune system helps to maintain homeostasis by mounting non-specific innate and
specific adaptive responses against potentially pathogenic micro-organisms. At the same
time, the immune system should tolerate self-antigens and innocuous non-self-antigens and
allergens as uncontrolled or inappropriate responses to such antigens contribute to the
pathogenic processes underlying various non-communicable diseases. Inappropriate or
exaggerated immune responses to allergens lead to allergic manifestations such as allergic
rhinitis (hay fever), allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis (eczema) and food allergy.
Sustained responses to persistent antigens, such as autoantigens or those that are derived
from commensal micro-organisms, lead to tissue remodelling and loss of function of the
affected tissue and contribute to the symptoms of chronic inflammatory diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis(

2

,

31

). More recently, it has also become apparent that metabolic stresses (e.g. in
visceral adipocytes of obese subjects) trigger low-grade asymptomatic inflammatory
responses, which contribute to the comorbidity of metabolic disorders(

32

,

33

).

These different aspects of immune function are highly relevant in the general population,
affecting the maintenance of health and vitality. Immune function markers are, therefore,
considered within the context of the following distinct physiological function domains of
the immune system: defence against pathogens; avoidance or mitigation of allergy; reduction
of asymptomatic low-grade metabolic inflammation.

Defence against pathogens relates to the physiological function of the immune system to
deal with (common) pathogens such that the infection does not establish itself, or if it
does, then with no or minimal symptoms. Avoidance or mitigation of allergy relates to the
ability of the immune system to tolerate potentially allergenic substances without symptoms
of allergy. The beneficial effects of nutrition on this activity could thus, in theory, lead
to reduced sensitisation to an allergen or mitigation of the severity of allergic responses
to non-food-related allergens such as respiratory or contact allergens and so are not
necessarily restricted to food allergy. Reduction of asymptomatic low-grade inflammation
relates to the ability of the immune system to control low-grade inflammatory responses that
are triggered by metabolic stresses and that, if improperly controlled, become chronic and
contribute to the pathophysiology of various diseases.

To exert its functions, the immune system deploys a range of structural, cellular and
molecular components. A wide variety of methods and markers are being used to measure the
magnitude of variation of these immune functions. Such markers range from the assessment of
clinical symptoms and integrated responses to particular in vivo challenges
and ex vivo assessment of isolated functions of the immune system to more
basic enumeration of a particular (sub)type of cell or measurement of the concentrations of
specific factors without any defined challenge to the system. Building on a previous
publication(

1

), we have classified the markers from the most integrated/physiologically
relevant to the most isolated/mechanistically insightful as illustrated in Fig. 2.Fig. 2 Graphical representation indicating the classification of immune function markers
from the most integrated/physiologically relevant to the most isolated/mechanistically
insightful, with the basal markers being positioned on the side as they do not
indicate a function by themselves, but aid in the interpretation of the functional
markers.




It is acknowledged that new technologies, such as genomics, proteomics and so forth, are
continuously being developed. Such techniques may, in the future, provide new biomarkers and
also more insight into relevant intracellular responses. Future evaluation of such new
biomarkers, however, can follow the same criteria as for the current biomarkers.

The following definitions are used in this work:Symptom: sensation or change in bodily function or appearance experienced by a person
that suggests a disorder or pathology (e.g. runny nose as a symptom of a respiratory
infection or rhinitis and watery stool as a symptom of diarrhoea).


In vivo response: integrated response to a (standardised) in
vivo challenge (e.g. response to vaccination, prick and patch tests or oral
provocation test).


Ex vivo response: (nutritional) intervention or comparison occurring
in vivo; cells or blood isolated from participants in a study is
assayed for functionality using a defined in vitro challenge (e.g.
phagocytosis, natural killer (NK) cell activity or production of cytokines by
ex vivo stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or whole
blood).


In vitro response: (nutritional) intervention or comparison occurring
in vitro; cells or blood isolated from subjects not participating
in a study is exposed in vitro to the compounds, nutrients and so
forth to be compared and is subsequently assayed for functionality using a defined
in vitro challenge. This use of functional assays is intended not
as a biomarker but rather as a tool for screening or mechanistic studies. This
approach is outside the scope of the current activity.

Basal markers: cellular or molecular components of the immune system that are
measured without a defined preceding challenge (e.g. cell types or cytokines). Not to
be confused with the basal level (which is the actual value).




Methodological and technical considerations
Study design, randomisation and selection of appropriate control groups are critically
important aspects when designing human studies for any outcome. Generic and more specific
considerations for studies focusing on the effects of nutrition on immune function have been
described in detail in earlier publications(

1

,

23

–

25

). The effects of nutrition are potentially important in the longer term, but are
typically modest and often difficult to observe in the short term. To assess these modest
effects, it is important to carefully consider other factors known to influence immune
function as these may otherwise obscure the effects of nutrition. Such confounders include
stress(

34

), age(

35

,

36

), sex(

37

), ethnicity, physical fitness(

18

), circadian(

38

,

39

) and seasonal(

40

) influences, and sleep deprivation(

41

). Using carefully selected procedures for randomisation and clear criteria for
(non)inclusion(

42

), these confounders should be controlled for as much as possible. In some cases,
they may also be used to select representative at-risk subpopulations to increase the
sensitivity of the study. Examples of this include the selection of children from atopic
parents(

43

), children in day-care centres exposed to a high infection load(

44

), people complying with specific exercise regimens(

18

), shift workers(

45

), people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome(

46

) or food intolerances(

47

,

48

), people with a BMI above a particular threshold(

49

), elderly individuals above a particular age(

50

) and so forth. Although this can greatly increase the sensitivity of the study
to detect modulation by nutrition, care should be taken that the selected subpopulation is
still sufficiently representative of the general population to allow meaningful
extrapolation. For the purpose of the current activity, we focus on the selection of markers
of immune functions to assess the effects of nutrition in the general population assuming
the use of properly controlled, well-designed observation or intervention studies that take
all of these critical elements into account.

When selecting markers to assess effects on immune function, it is important to realise
that the identification, development and (clinical) validation of markers are mostly done in
the context of diseases. Whereas the relevance of particular markers for the diagnosis or
prognosis of specific diseases may be well established, their relevance in a general
population is typically less clear as very few prognostic studies have carefully assessed
the predictive value of these markers for maintenance of health. Moreover, in the context of
disease, markers are commonly used to determine the diagnosis or prognosis for individual
patients. Based on a comparison of a patient's marker with a defined normal or reference
range, conclusions are drawn for the individual patient. In contrast, in the context of
nutritional effects in the general population, immune function markers are used to establish
meaningful changes that occur at the group level. Typically, average (changes in) values of
markers in one group are compared with (changes in) the values of markers in a control or
reference group. This can be done observationally to assess associations between particular
nutritional traits and immune functions or experimentally by applying a specific nutritional
intervention in one of two groups to assess the impact of that intervention. In both cases,
conclusions are drawn regarding the effect of the nutritional difference on immune function
at the group level. Despite these differences between the use and interpretation of markers
in the context of disease or in the context of the general population, essentially similar
criteria apply when determining the usefulness of individual markers, although the relative
weight of the individual criteria may be somewhat different.

In all cases, it should be clear as to what marker is measured and the assay used should
measure it reliably; procedures and assays should be properly standardised and analytically
validated. This includes the use of standardised operating procedures, including details of
sampling, transport, storage and measurement of the analytes. Many analytes are sensitive to
sampling conditions such as time during the day (circadian rhythm), fasting
v. non-fasting, subject anxiety or stress level and even whether a blood
sample is taken using a venepuncture or an indwelling catheter. Conditions for sample
processing, transport and storage should, therefore, be clearly established and
standardised, and the laboratory measurement should be analytically validated. This includes
specificity, sensitivity, limit of detection, precision, robustness and linearity involving
proper quality control and international gold standards if available. Several excellent
papers have provided more specific information on the critical aspects of analytical
validation and general laboratory quality management systems (e.g. EN ISO 15 189 and EN ISO
17 025) or on those described in the good clinical laboratory practice guidelines(

51

–

55

).

Some immune function markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), differential cell counts or
lymphocyte subset distributions are commonly used in clinical settings; for these properly
validated procedures, assays and defined normal ranges and threshold values have been
established (see, for instance, http://labtestsonline.org/). An example of reference ranges for
lymphocyte subsets in different age groups has been given in several publications(

56

–

59

). However, most of these markers are basal markers involving the enumeration of
cells or factors in a sample without controlled experimental stimulation to assess a
specific functional response. Such markers can aid the interpretation of more functional
assays, but by themselves have limited value in nutrition studies, as they are rather
insensitive to detect a modest modulation due to nutrition and are difficult to interpret in
the general population. Unfortunately, more useful markers involving a functional response
to a challenge such as in vivo challenge tests and ex vivo
cellular function assays are much less standardised, have not been validated to the same
extent and results can generally not be compared very well between laboratories. Moreover,
assays and procedures involved are frequently tailored, for instance, by using suboptimal
stimulation conditions (suboptimal concentration or incubation time) in ex
vivo functional cell assays or by assessing responses after a suboptimal
vaccination protocol (low level of adjuvant, low vaccine dose, only fraction of a
multiple-dose antigen given, and assessment of the response during its early exponential
phase). Although these modifications make good sense to increase the sensitivity and dynamic
range to detect modulatory effects by avoiding saturation of the responses, they have led to
a broad variety in protocols being used, many of which are not yet sufficiently standardised
or validated to allow comparisons between different laboratories. There is a clear need for
further standardisation and validation of these markers using protocols optimised to assess
(alterations in) immune function in the general population. This should include further
standardisation, analytical validation and ring testing between sites. Once this has been
established, it will become more feasible to include such markers in prospective cohorts
aiming to establish normal ranges and threshold values as well as their predictive values in
the general population.

Normal ranges and thresholds are commonly used in clinical settings to interpret (changes
in) markers of individual patients. Despite the different contexts and the limitations
indicated above, essentially similar principles may be applied to devise a rational
framework to aid the interpretation of nutritional effects on immune function at the group
level in the general population. In the absence of more generically applicable normal
ranges, (changes in) immune function markers are commonly compared with the following: the
value of the markers in the same subjects before the intervention, the values of the markers
in an appropriate control group matched for the most relevant criteria (age, sex, body
weight, etc.) within the same study or combinations of the above (e.g. comparing the change
within subjects between groups).

The strengths and limitations of these approaches have been discussed previously, and
selection of the most appropriate reference group needs to be done on a case-by-case
basis(

1

,

18

,

22

–

25

,

27

). Importantly, for markers without established normal ranges and threshold
values, comparison with the reference range obtained in an appropriate control group can be
used as the basis for the interpretation of effects. This can be done by using statistical
significance after appropriate analysis to determine the threshold for relevance as
discussed in more detail below.

Criteria to select immune function markers
As has been indicated above, a wide variety of markers can be used to assess different
aspects of the immune system, and multiple assays based on diverse technical principles are
often available. We aimed to define generic criteria to select the most useful markers. It
is acknowledged that markers may respond in clusters or that ratios of different markers may
be calculated. Such marker clusters or ratios have not been included (except for an example
of an immune risk profile defined in elderly individuals) in order not to further increase
the size of the tables. The reader can, however, compile such composite markers and assess
their usefulness following the criteria set out below.

The criteria and scoring system used are based on the work by Albers et al.
(

1

) involving criteria that cover clinical relevance, biological sensitivity,
feasibility and practical aspects for use in nutrition studies. Scores range from 0 to +++,
where +++ is the highest score for the most solid evidence. More details on the standardised
scaling used for each of these criteria are provided in Table 1. Table 1 Criteria for the evaluation of markers

Because the analysis focuses on the evaluation and ranking of markers and not on assays
used to measure these markers, criteria for analytical validation were not included.
Instead, it was assumed that markers are assessed using the optimal assay, according to the
relevant standards discussed in the following sections on methodological and technical
considerations and the selection and prioritisation of markers. In addition, whether a
marker has previously been shown to be sensitive to nutrition was not included as a
criterion because this is severely confounded by what has been tried and does not help to
assess the intrinsic usefulness of a marker to define the (modulation) of immune function.
However, when designing a specific study, it would be wise to consider the possibility that
a particular marker is modulated by that particular nutritional modification (e.g. based on
existing data or on mechanistic insights). The criteria that were selected to evaluate the
generic usefulness of markers can be grouped into three clusters: clinical relevance;
biological sensitivity; feasibility. In addition, practical aspects including costs and
logistic implications were scored because these are important aspects to know; however, as
these are non-scientific arguments that may weigh very differently in different settings,
these practicalities were not included in the integrative assessment of the overall
usefulness of the markers.

Clinical relevance
Clinical relevance is the weight that one would give to a specific biomarker to reflect
an immune system-mediated clinically detectable health status in the general population

Differentially expressed in normal and high-risk individuals
This criterion should be linked to the different functional domains (defence against
pathogens, allergens and inflammation). Scores given in Tables 2 and 3 are for the
functional domain for which the marker has most relevance. While the level of a given
marker may be important, the way it is measured is also relevant because the evaluation
can be made based on single measurements as well as the kinetics of a marker response.
Markers without any known or anticipated relevance for the general population are
outside the scope of this article (e.g. specific leucocyte tumour markers). Table 2 Clinical symptoms and in vivo immune function markers

†† Specific IgE (sIgE) clearly indicates the involvement of immune function, but
its relevance is controversial in the absence of concurrent clinical assessment.
Some see it as a clinically relevant marker also used to guide therapy, whereas
others (including the European Food Safety Authority) emphasise that not all
allergic subjects have sIgE, not all subjects with sIgE have allergic symptoms
and changes in sIgE are not always associated with changes in symptoms.

‡‡ Mainly relevant in gastrointestinal patients.




Correlates with relevant clinical endpoint
Note that correlation does not necessarily imply causality. Markers without a known
correlation with a given immunological function/status for the general population are
outside the scope of this work for further evaluation.

Experimentally linked to causal pathway
The markers rating the highest would be those for which proof of causality has been
clearly established using human data.

Biological sensitivity
Biological sensitivity is the level to which the marker is influenced by and linked to
the biological process. This factor is highly influenced by the ‘normal’ inter- and
intra-subject variation as well as by the amplitude of the studied effect. A distinction
is made between explainable variation and unexplainable variation; it is assumed that it
would be possible to (partially) correct for the former.

Reasonable within-subject variation
The higher the within-subject variation, the larger the number of subjects required to
observe an effect within a subject and the lower the score. As many immune function
markers have (substantially) lower intra- than inter-subject variation, comparison of
changes within subjects between groups (instead of comparing individual measurements per
subject) often helps to increase sensitivity to detect effects.

Reasonable/explainable between-subject variation
The higher the between-subject variation, the larger the number of subjects required to
observe an effect between groups and the lower the score.

Feasibility
Feasibility pertains to how feasible/practical it is to measure the biomarker.

Technical feasibility
The sensitivity of the assay available should be sufficient to detect the effect. The
assay can be used repeatedly if needed (e.g. no saturation of response as with
vaccination). The criteria include aspects such as stability of the marker, storage of
the sample (storage possible v. need to work with fresh material),
limitations of sample transportation, level of preanalytical processing and so
forth.

Robustness
This criterion makes a general assessment of the precision and accuracy of the best
assay available to measure a given marker. This reflects the level of variation between
assays performed by different people, with different instruments (if relevant) or in
different laboratories as well as the degree of uncertainty about the result obtained.
The best score is given to a standardised assay with an acceptable CV that enables the
detection of the expected effect size. This is reflected by approval or non-approval by
regulatory authorities and/or wide distribution. Note that an assay only used in a
single research laboratory can be very robust, but strong evidence would not be
accessible to prove so.

Practicality
Practicality pertains to how practically feasible it is to measure the biomarker in
nutrition studies. Although cost and logistic aspects involved in the assessment of
particular markers affect the feasibility to include markers in particular studies,
these aspects were not taken into consideration when determining the overall usefulness
of a marker, which was based on scientific criteria. As these practical aspects are
nonetheless very important, a score is provided for information based on aspects such as
the number of visits the subject is required to make, the availability and cost of the
assay, the degree of expertise needed to perform the assay and so forth.

Selection and prioritisation of markers
Over seventy-five commonly used or recommended markers were evaluated according to the
criteria specified in Table 1. For these markers,
Tables 2 and 3 indicate the following: (1) whether a marker has relevance for the general
population or is mainly relevant for specific subpopulations; (2) scores given for each of
the defined criteria detailed in Table 1, all
scored from 0 to +++; (3) an overall marker score indicating the subjective expert judgement
on the usefulness of each marker based on the weighed evaluation of scores for individual
criteria (□, not very useful; ■, low suitability; ■■, medium suitability; and ■■■, high
suitability); (4) practicalities associated with the assessment of a marker (need for
expensive, specialised equipment, need for repeated assessments, etc.); (5) plausible link
to the three domains of immune function (scored not relevant (0) to most relevant (+++) for
each domain), including defence against pathogens, avoidance or mitigation of allergy, and
control of low-grade metabolic inflammation; (6) references illustrating the use of a
particular marker in nutrition studies.


Table 2 summarises the clinical symptoms and
in vivo markers for the three domains of physiological immune function.
Symptoms of conditions that are relatively common in the general population are sometimes
used as indirect markers of immune function. Clearly, they provide the most clinically
relevant indication of intervention effects, but it is important to realise that symptoms by
themselves may not necessarily indicate altered immune function because other non-immune
system-mediated mechanisms may be responsible for the changes in symptom scores. As
self-assessment has been criticised for being subjective, unspecific and therefore
unreliable, it is important that symptoms be scored by qualified persons blinded to the
intervention. Alternatively, properly validated questionnaires can be used, which may be
complemented by confirmation of symptoms by qualified persons. Examples of validated
questionnaires include the Jackson(

60

–

62

) and Wisconsin(

63

–

65

) scores for respiratory infections, the Vesikari(

66

) or WHO(

67

) scores for diarrhoea, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)(

68

–

70

) for eczema, Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma(

71

) for rhinitis, Asthma Control Test(

72

) or Test for Respiratory and Asthma Control in Kids(

73

) for asthma, and Mini Nutrition Surveys for the health and well-being of elderly
individuals(

74

,

75

). Because symptoms of naturally occurring infections or allergies develop at
unpredictable moments and relatively infrequently in the general population, they are only
useful as markers in studies of sufficient size and duration. To some extent, this can be
addressed by performing the study in periods with increased incidence (e.g. winter for
respiratory infections and spring/summer for hay fever) or by selecting (sub)populations
more prone to develop symptoms such as groups with a higher prevalence of getting infected
(e.g. children in developing regions, elderly individuals in nursing homes, children
attending day-care centres, shift workers, etc.) or populations predisposed to develop
allergies (e.g. children of atopic parents). However, in such cases, it is important to
evaluate to what extent the outcome of the study can still be extrapolated to the general
population. Contrary to (common) infections and allergies, inflammatory responses do not
lead to symptoms that can be usefully assessed in the general population. Low-grade
metabolic inflammation associated with (visceral) adiposity or inflammation linked to ageing
is quite common, but by itself does not lead to overt symptoms.

Instead of waiting for symptoms to occur due to natural causes, they can also be elicited
as part of the study design using an experimental infection with (attenuated) pathogens or a
provocation with allergens. For instance, studies have successfully assessed symptoms
elicited by an experimental infection with rhinoviruses(

76

–

78

), Shigella
(

79

), respiratory syncytial virus(

80

) or enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
(

81

). Likewise, acute symptoms elicited by ingestion(

82

,

83

) or nasal application(

84

,

85

) of allergens such as those used for the diagnosis and monitoring of allergy can
also be used as markers in nutrition studies, be it that they will only result in symptoms
in subjects who are allergic to a particular allergen. Importantly, unlike naturally
occurring symptoms in which the time of occurrence and the exact eliciting trigger are
unknown, experimental challenges make it feasible to combine the assessment of symptoms with
that of the markers of contributing immune function(s) and even the kinetics of responses
can be monitored to help establish cause–effect relations.

Although it is scientifically very attractive to use experimental challenges leading to
symptoms that can be associated with changes in specific immune functions, such an approach
clearly has ethical constraints. In particular studies, it may be more feasible to use
somewhat weaker or more localised challenges that do not lead to symptoms but still modulate
the relevant immune functions. Such in vivo markers of immune function
include responses to vaccination (as a model for the response to an infection), to dermal
recall antigen application (as a model for immune surveillance of the skin), to (local)
allergen challenge (as a model for allergic responsiveness) and to transient inflammatory
responses triggered by a pro-inflammatory challenge (as a model for the resilience of
inflammatory control).

Vaccines trigger in vivo immune responses almost without eliciting
symptoms of disease that would result from inoculation with live virulent pathogens.
Specific immune responses to vaccines that are part of a national vaccination schedule can
be used as in vivo indicators of the integrated immune response to these
vaccines. Alternatively, one or more selected vaccinations can be integrated into the design
of a study. Selection or stratification of subjects based on pre-existing responsiveness and
careful consideration of the vaccine used (e.g. oral v. injected, type and
dose of adjuvant, primary v. booster, single v. multiple
dose, and T-cell independent v. T-cell dependent) and time point(s)
selected to assess the response (early exponential phase v. later plateau
phase, v. detailed analysis of the kinetics of the response) in relation to
the postulated mechanism of action and the population in which the study will be performed
can help to increase the sensitivity to detect the modulation of responsiveness due to
nutrition. Seroprotection is defined as an antibody titre superior to an established
threshold for clinical protection specific to each vaccine(

86

,

87

). Seroconversion is defined as a certain fold increase in specific antibody
titres before and after vaccination(

86

), e.g. at least a fourfold rise in the case of influenza vaccines(

88

).

Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and contact hypersensitivity responses are local
cell-mediated inflammatory responses triggered in sensitised individuals by the cutaneous
administration of an antigen. Such responses can be measured 24–48 h after antigen
application as epidermal induration(

89

). For diagnostic purposes, DTH responses such as the prototypic Mantoux test
have been largely replaced by more specific methods; however, as indicators of integrated
in vivo cellular immune responsiveness, they remain valuable markers of
immune function. However, standardised application has become complicated since the Cell
Mediated Immunity (CMI) Multitest, in which seven different common antigenic preparations
are administered simultaneously, is no longer available. Rigorously standardised application
of antigenic material by syringe or prick is occasionally used; however, since application
only yields DTH responses in sensitised subjects, it is important to apply a range of
antigens. These problems have been overcome in several studies by experimentally sensitising
subjects to uncommon chemical antigens not normally encountered. In this way, all subjects
will respond, and the effect of nutrition on both the sensitisation and the elicitation
phase of contact hypersensitivity responses can be assessed(

90

,

91

). Although this is scientifically very attractive, there are clear ethical
constraints. The same holds true for the assessment of Langerhans cells in skin biopsies,
which can be used to assess temporal depletion of Langerhans cells due to migration induced
by UV radiation. This is associated with increased susceptibility to (skin) infections, and
mitigation of this depletion can, therefore, serve as a relevant marker of skin immune
function(

92

).

The physical barrier of the gastrointestinal tract is central to the protection of the body
against infections, allergens and inflammatory stimuli alike(

93

–

96

). Tests designed to examine the integrity of the intestinal barrier typically
involve the appearance of marker substances in plasma or urine after oral application of
such substances (most often a non-metabolised sugar) and/or of resident bacteria or
components thereof such as endotoxins after translocation from the lumen of the intestine
into the circulation. These markers are considered useful to assess alterations in
intestinal barrier function, which is considered important in gastrointestinal infections
and (food) allergies as well as low-grade inflammation. However, in the strict sense, such
markers do not necessarily demonstrate alterations in (mucosal) immune function as the
permeability may be altered by non-immunological mechanisms.


In vivo provocation tests with allergens aim to reproduce allergic
reactions in conditions as close as the natural exposure and using a lower dose and
standardised conditions of exposure. Allergen provocation tests include intradermal
injection or trans-cutaneous patches on the skin(

97

,

98

), oral provocation with food allergens(

99

,

100

) and mucosal (nasal, conjunctival, bronchial or labial) provocation with
allergens(

101

,

102

). While allergen provocation tests are quite safe to be used for most people,
the possibility of anaphylaxis does exist and such tests should, therefore, only be done
under clinical supervision.

Responsiveness to experimental inflammatory challenges has been suggested as a useful
marker of inflammatory resilience. This involves the assessment of transient inflammatory
responses induced by metabolic stressors (e.g. oral glucose or lipid load), infection
stressors (e.g. injection with lipopolysaccharide, TNF, or IL-6 or the early response to the
adjuvant components of vaccines) or tissue damage (e.g. acute exercise and exposure to UV
radiation). Such dynamic responses to inflammatory challenges are promising markers of
inflammatory resilience and are likely to be more relevant indicators of the ability to
maintain inflammatory homeostasis than the mere static assessment of acute-phase proteins
(e.g. CRP) or cytokines. However, there is a clear need for further standardisation of
experimental protocols, and relevance in the general population remains to be established in
prospective studies(

31

).

The evaluation of a range of ex vivo and basal markers of immune function
is summarised in Table 3. It is beyond the scope of
this article to provide detailed technical information on the assessment of all of these
immune function markers as they are quite commonly used and specific considerations have
been discussed in a detailed manner elsewhere(

use of individual markers in nutrition studies.

Clustering of markers according to clinical relevance and involvement of immune
functions
A selection of the most relevant markers given in Tables
2 and 3 are further categorised in Table 4 according to the most relevant functional
domain (horizontally) while indicating (vertically) whether the markers by themselves are
classified into the following groups. Group A is indicative of clinical relevance and
involvement of immune function(s) (e.g. response to vaccination). Group B is indicative of
clinical relevance but not necessarily of the involvement of immune function(s) (e.g.
symptoms of diarrhoea). Group C is indicative of the involvement of immune function(s) and
is associated with clinical relevance in specific (sub)populations (selected markers such as
NK-cell activity, which is associated with infection risk in athletes and elderly
individuals). Group D provides mechanistic insight into details of the immune function(s)
involved, but not necessarily of clinical relevance (e.g. circulating levels of cytokines).

* sIgE clearly indicates the involvement of immune function, but in the absence of
concurrent clinical assessment, its relevance is controversial. Some see it as a
clinically relevant marker also used to guide therapy, whereas others (including the
European Food Safety Authority) emphasise that not all allergic subjects have sIgE,
not all subjects with sIgE have allergic symptoms and changes in sIgE are not always
associated with changes in symptoms.




This classification helps in the interpretation of study outcomes and can also be used to
further rationalise the selection of markers for inclusion in future studies. To some
extent, it may also guide in making decisions in preclinical investigations. Clearly,
markers of group A are most useful as they provide evidence for both clinical relevance and
involvement of immune function(s) by themselves. However, it may not always be feasible to
select markers from this group. In such cases, combining the assessment of markers from
group B with that of markers from group C or D will lead to more confidence in the future
interpretation of the data regarding clinical relevance and involvement of altered immune
function(s). The same argument applies for a combination of group A markers with group C or
D markers, linking clinical relevance with mechanistic insight. Such approaches will also
result in new datasets that may be used to establish correlations of particular group C or D
markers with clinical endpoints, which may lead to their evolution into group A markers
within a reasonable time frame. In contrast, measuring numerous group B markers alone will
lead to results that may be very clear regarding the clinical relevance, but remain
inconclusive on the involvement of (altered) immune functions. Likewise, studies that focus
exclusively on group D markers may very convincingly demonstrate that particular immune
functions are altered, but the clinical relevance of these changes will remain largely
elusive.

The list of markers given in Table 4 is
non-exhaustive and should not be regarded as final since markers may evolve if more data
become available. Instead, Table 4 provides the
next step in a rational approach towards the design and interpretation of studies that aim
to establish effects on immune function in the general population. The markers mentioned
serve to illustrate how changes in these markers due to exogenous factors such as nutrition
could be interpreted in the context of different scenarios described below. Selection and
classification of the markers are based on the authors' expert judgement aided by discussion
of an earlier version of this table with a wider group of experts.

It is noteworthy that many of the valuable group A markers indicating both clinical
relevance and involvement of the immune system are ‘challenge tests’ comprising the
assessment of in vivo responses of the immune system to a relevant
(experimental) challenge. For defence against pathogens, these include immune responses to
an (experimental) infection, to a vaccination and to a challenge with a recall antigen using
a DTH or contact hypersensitivity test. For avoidance or mitigation of allergy, commonly
used allergen provocation tests such as prick, intradermal and patch tests and labial,
respiratory and oral challenges with specific allergens fall into this category. The
corresponding pro-inflammatory challenge tests hold great promise as markers of the
resilience of inflammatory control, but their clinical relevance has not been established
yet(

31

). For the time being, pro-inflammatory challenge tests are, therefore,
classified as group C markers. In addition to the challenge tests, several other markers are
placed in group A because they are clear indicators of the involvement of the immune system
and their clinical relevance in the general population has been established, and modulation
in the relevant direction would, therefore, be considered a beneficial health effect. For
instance, mucosal IgA is a group A marker for defence against pathogens because it is a
marker of immune function and low (salivary) IgA is a risk factor for respiratory infections
in children and athletes(

103

–

110

). For avoidance or mitigation of allergy, the basophil activation test(

111

,

112

) and tryptase(

113

) in plasma are considered group A markers because they reflect basophil
reactivity in allergic patients and are considered risk factors correlated with the severity
of the reaction. Allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) clearly indicates the involvement of immune
function; however, in the absence of concurrent clinical assessment, its relevance in the
general population is controversial. Some consider it as a clinically relevant marker (risk
factor), whereas others (including the European Food Safety Authority) emphasise that not
all allergic subjects have sIgE, not all subjects with sIgE have allergic symptoms and
changes in sIgE are not always associated with changes in symptoms(

114

,

115

). To acknowledge this controversy, we have indicated sIgE in groups A and C.

Group B markers are clinically relevant markers or endpoints (symptoms) that indicate the
relevance of an effect, but in isolation do not prove the involvement of altered immune
function as the effects could also be mediated via other mechanisms. For defence against
pathogens, these include pathogen load and symptoms of common respiratory tract or
gastrointestinal infections. Likewise, for avoidance or mitigation of allergy, symptoms of
allergic responses due to undefined natural exposure to allergens indicate clinical
relevance, but lack the specificity to prove the involvement of the immune system. This is
also true for in vivo challenges with whole food products (milk) or
substances such as lactose to which subjects may also respond with non-immune
system-mediated intolerance. Low-grade inflammation does not lead to overt symptoms in the
general population but is associated with reduced sensitivity to insulin and increased
systolic blood pressure. However, these symptoms are not specific to low-grade inflammation
and can also be modified by other non-immune system-mediated processes.

Group C markers typically reflect critical immune functions involved in the
pathophysiological pathways underlying clinically relevant symptoms. Unlike group A markers,
these markers are not generally accepted as markers of clinical relevance by themselves
(risk factors), but there is ample evidence from relevant subpopulations that (alterations
in) these markers are associated with (alterations in) clinical outcomes, and this is
supported by a plausible mechanism of action. For instance, the precise predictive value of
ex vivo NK-cell, phagocyte, or (pathogen-specific) T- or B-cell functions
for infection risk is unknown. However, these immune functions are plausibly involved in the
defence against pathogens, and a range of studies in elderly individuals, athletes, shift
workers and other subpopulations have demonstrated that these ex vivo
functional markers are inversely associated with the occurrence of symptomatic infections.
Likewise, depletion of Langerhans cells in the skin due to UV radiation has been shown to be
associated with an increased risk of (skin) infections, which plausibly is related to the
reduced ability to present antigens and thus mount a protective immune response. For
avoidance or mitigation of allergy, some feel that sIgE falls into this category for reasons
discussed above. In addition, the remainder of ex vivo allergen-specific
Th1- and Th2-cell function, Treg function and antigen-presenting cell function
fall into this category. For the time being, in vivo responses to a
pro-inflammatory challenge are a group C marker for inflammation control, but they may
evolve to a group A marker if relevance can be established in prospective cohorts in the
general population. Serum markers of the acute-phase response (such as CRP) or (ratios of)
pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators do define low-grade asymptomatic inflammation, but are
not accepted as proof of clinical relevance in the general population. Nonetheless, there is
a wealth of emerging data in various subpopulations including elderly individuals and obese
and insulin-insensitive subjects, demonstrating that (alterations in) levels of these
markers are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes(

116

–

119

). To a lesser extent, the same holds true for ex vivo oxidative
burst and functionality of Th1, Th17 and Treg subsets, all of which are,
therefore, also considered group C markers.

Group D markers also indicate the involvement of particular immune functions, but contrary
to group C markers, their critical involvement in the pathophysiology is less established
and there is no convincing evidence (yet) that changes in these markers are associated with
changes in relevant clinical outcomes. This has implications for the ability to interpret
changes observed in these markers, as will be discussed below. In essence, group D contains
‘all other’ markers of immune function. The examples mentioned in Table 4 serve to contrast the categorisation of the same marker for
different functional domains, such as markers of acute-phase response and (ratio of) pro-
and anti-inflammatory markers as group C markers for inflammation control
v. group D markers for defence against infection and avoidance or
mitigation of allergy. Other examples contrast different markers within one functional
domain, such as sIgE (group A or C) v. total IgE (group D) for avoidance of
allergy or plasma adiponectin and leptin (group D) v. (ratio of) pro- and
anti-inflammatory mediators (group C) for inflammation control.

It is important to note that for control of low-grade asymptomatic inflammation, there are
no specific markers indicating clinical relevance (group A or B). Insulin resistance and
blood pressure are very unspecific, and the clinical relevance of the most useful markers in
this domain including response to inflammatory challenge, CRP and inflammatory mediators
remains to be established in the general population. This lack of markers to establish
clinical relevance severely hampers proper interpretation of effects on markers of low-grade
inflammation. It is, therefore, of critical importance for progress in this area to
establish the clinical relevance of the most promising markers using prospective cohorts in
the general population. Such efforts should not only focus on concentrations or ratios of
circulating inflammatory mediators, but also include responsiveness to rigorously
standardised in vivo pro-inflammatory challenge tests as these types of
challenge tests have been shown to be most useful in the other domains of immune
function.

Scenarios to interpret changes in (sets of) markers
Following the definition of criteria, prioritisation of markers and classification
according to conclusiveness for clinical relevance and involvement of immune function, we
set out to devise a framework for the interpretation of changes observed in the different
types of immune function markers, taking into account the type of marker and the changes
observed relative to a defined reference range. Obviously, the proposed approach does not
discount the need to critically consider the quality of individual studies and consistency
of effects and to base the ultimate conclusions on the totality of evidence. Herein, we
propose a theoretical framework to structure the interpretation of changes in immune
function markers due to nutrition in the general population. As depicted and explained in
more detail in Fig. 3, five scenarios were defined
for changes in markers relative to the appropriate reference range.Fig. 3 Graphical representation of the five different scenarios for the modulation of immune
function markers relative to the reference range. Scenario 1: statistically
significant modulation within the reference range or within the range of a relevant
control population, a very common scenario for modulation due to nutrition. Scenario
2: statistically significant modulation from outside the reference or control range of
a relevant control population back into the range. Cases are different before
intervention and become similar after intervention. Scenario 3: statistically
significant modulation from within the reference or control range of a relevant
control population out of the range. Cases are similar before intervention and become
different after intervention. Scenario 4: nutritional prevention of statistically
significant modulation induced by other endogenous or exogenous factors. Markers move
out of the reference range of a relevant control population in the reference group,
but this is prevented by nutrition in the intervention group (e.g. prevention of
negative effects on the immune function of ageing or UV-B exposure or prevention of
allergic sensitisation). Scenario 5: statistically significant modulation from a less
favourable reference range to the reference range of a comparator group with a more
desired immune function (e.g. from bottle-fed infants to breast-fed infants, elderly
individuals to healthy adults, strenuous exercise to healthy controls, sleep
deprivation to sleep sufficiency, etc.).




The first step to interpret immune modulation in a particular setting is to determine
whether one or more relevant markers of immune function are statistically significantly
modulated by the intervention and, if so, to determine which of the scenarios applies. If
the marker by itself indicates clinical relevance but not altered immune function (group B),
and the effect is not accompanied by a plausibly linked change in a marker indicating
altered immune function, then the effect is clinically relevant but may not necessarily be
due to altered immune function and cannot be interpreted as such (e.g. reduced incidence or
severity of diarrhoea on its own). If the marker by itself is indicative of immune
function(s) and clinical relevance (group A marker), then the result can be interpreted as a
beneficial modulation of immune function for scenarios 1, 2, 4 and 5. In scenario 3, this
raises some concern and needs to be evaluated in more detail as described below. If the
marker by itself is indicative of immune function(s), but in isolation does not indicate
clinical relevance (group C), then interpretation as a beneficial modulation of immune
function is possible for scenarios 1, 2, 4 and 5, if in the same or a similar study setting
(a similar population or the same nutritional intervention), a marker indicating clinical
relevance (group A or B) is also significantly changed and the changes are linked via a
plausible mechanism. Again, for scenario 3, further evaluation is required to assess the
potential for detrimental modulation of immune function, especially after prolonged
exposure. For scenario 4, interpretation as a beneficial immune modulation would also be
possible, but in this case, the intervention would prevent the negative changes occurring in
the reference or control group. Finally, if the change is observed in a marker indicating
altered immune function(s) but not necessarily clinical relevance in all populations (group
C) and information on the markers of clinical relevance is lacking in the same or a similar
study, then interpretation of the immune effects is not possible in scenario 1, but may
indicate a beneficial modulation in specific cases (scenarios 2, 4 and 5). This is depicted
in Fig. 4. To explore this approach in more detail,
it is applied to five scenarios discussed below with some examples for the different
functional domains.Fig. 4 Flow chart to aid the interpretation of changes in immune function markers in
nutrition studies based on information on the type of markers in which significant
changes are observed (groups A–D) and the relative change compared with the reference
range (scenarios 1–5). Blue indicates a health effect but not necessarily due to
immune modulation, green indicates beneficial modulation of immune function, orange
indicates potentially undesired modulation of immune function and red indicates no
effect or interpretation not possible. Group A, relevance AND the involvement of
immune functions (e.g. response to vaccination). Group B, relevance BUT NOT
necessarily the involvement of immune functions (e.g. diarrhoea). Group C, involvement
of immune function(s) AND associated with clinical relevance in specific
(sub)populations (e.g. NK-cell activity in athletes and elderly). Group D, mechanistic
insights BUT NOT directly associated with clinical relevance (e.g. cytokines).




Scenario 1: nutrition induces a significant modulation of a marker within the
reference range
If a relevant marker of immune function is statistically significantly modulated in the
relevant direction and the marker per se is also indicative of the
clinical relevance of effects observed (group A marker), such as improved responsiveness
to an infection or a vaccine or reduced responsiveness to an (oral) allergen provocation
test, then the modulation of this response within the reference range would be interpreted
as a beneficial modulation of immune function within the specific domain. It is critical
to consider the changes in immune functions within the context of a specific functional
domain as for some markers the interpretation may differ depending on the domain. For
instance, in the context of defence against pathogens, enhanced DTH to an antigenic
challenge would be regarded as an enhanced response to a ‘model infection’ and would thus
be considered beneficial. However, in the context of allergy, enhancement of a
(delayed-type) hypersensitive response to an allergen challenge would be undesirable,
whereas mitigation of such a response would be considered beneficial.

Similarly, if a statistically significant change in a marker indicative of immune
function (group C) is plausibly linked to a statistically significant change in a marker
of clinical relevance (group B marker), then the modulation of this marker could be
interpreted as beneficial, and one can claim that nutrition improves immune defence
against pathogens or helps to avoid or mitigate allergy or inflammation. For example, if
consumption of a certain nutrient significantly reduced the duration of gastrointestinal
infections during the winter season (group B) compared with a control group and
concomitantly phagocyte function (group C) increased within the reference range in the
infected subjects and these are plausibly linked based on mechanistic insights, the
interpretation would be that this nutrient improves immune defence against pathogens.
Another example in the field of allergy would be if consumption of a certain nutrient
significantly reduced the severity of rhinitis (group B) compared with a control group and
concomitantly Th2-cell function (group C) decreased within the reference range for the
general population. In such cases, the interpretation would be that this nutrient
mitigates hypersensitivity against allergens because these two markers are plausibly
linked.

If the immune function marker belongs to the category of markers that are only indicative
of the involvement of the immune system (group C or D) and evidence for concomitant
changes in the markers of clinical relevance in the same or similar studies is lacking,
then modulation within the reference range cannot be interpreted in terms of its health
impact. However, complemented with other studies with acceptable biomarkers, such data
could be used as supportive evidence of an immune regulatory effect. Finally, if the
marker is indicative of clinical relevance but there is no significant change in plausibly
associated markers of immune function (group B alone), clearly this is beneficial to
health, but the effect may not necessarily be due to altered immune function and should
not be interpreted as such. For instance, if the incidence or duration of diarrhoea is
significantly reduced, this is beneficial. However, without additional information on
changes in plausibly linked markers of immune function, this cannot be interpreted as a
beneficial modulation of immune function because the underlying mechanism may be
completely different.

Scenario 2: nutrition induces a significant modulation of a marker from outside the
reference or control range back into the range
The interpretation for this scenario is essentially identical to that for scenario 1 with
one addition. In the absence of data on changes in clinical relevance in the same or a
similar study (the same intervention in a similar population), changes in markers
indicative of immune function (group C) could potentially also be interpreted using a
two-step argumentation if a change in these markers is described in the literature to be
strongly associated with health improvement. An example may be if a (nutritional)
intervention induced an increase in NK-cell activity back to the reference range and it is
known that decreased levels of NK-cell activity have been strongly linked in the
literature with decreased defence against pathogens or tumours in particular populations
(e.g. athletes and elderly individuals). If there is no such established association with
clinically relevant outcomes in the literature, then the interpretation of the relevance
of immune function marker modulation back to the reference range is not possible (group
D). However, one could argue that modulation back into the reference range could be
positively perceived in terms of reassurance against potential negative effects.

Scenario 3: nutrition induces a significant modulation of a marker from within the
reference or control range to outside the range
If particular markers of immune function move from within the reference range to outside
the reference range, such results should be interpreted within their context. In such
situations, it may be useful to take the timing and sequence of events into account. For
instance, if this occurs during an acute infection process, allergic manifestation or
inflammatory episode, then the out-of-range markers may be more attributable to the
ongoing host response to the infection/allergens/inflammation rather than to the
nutritional intervention. In such cases, it is also important to look at the magnitude of
the effect and the consistency of changes observed among related markers. If it is not
just a (statistical) artifact, but a consistent pattern of substantial modulation of
related markers out of the reference range attributable to the intervention, then this is
a sign to look more closely at potential unwanted side effects that could develop if this
is sustained in the longer term.

Normally, such potentially deleterious effects should surface during animal studies in
the preclinical phase. In the event that these emerge at a later stage, it would be
recommended to initiate (additional) animal studies to gain a better mechanistic
understanding and/or restrict use in humans to populations that are not at risk for the
tentative adverse effects while initiating a ‘pharmacovigilance’-type study (postmarketing
surveillance study). Clearly, a careful consideration of the risks v. the
benefits of longer-term exposure to such ingredients/products is warranted.

Scenario 4: nutrition prevents a significant modulation of a marker from within the
reference or control range to outside the range
If particular markers of immune function in the control or reference group move from
within the reference range to outside the range due to other factors and this is prevented
by nutrition, this could be interpreted as a beneficial maintenance of normal immune
function. In essence, this is the reverse of scenario 3 and would constitute increased
resilience of the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. This could involve the prevention of
the negative impact of UV-B exposure or of strenuous exercise on immune function(s) or
prevention or delay of ageing-associated immune senescence. Likewise, although
allergen-sIgE is normally absent in a population, if followed prospectively, the levels of
allergen-sIgE will increase in a subpopulation due to allergic sensitisation. Prevention
of such negative effects could be interpreted as a beneficial modulation of immune
function if the marker itself signifies clinical relevance as well as immune function
(group A) or if evidence of plausibly linked markers of clinical relevance (group B) and
contributing immune function (group C) can be combined. In the absence of data on clinical
relevance in the same or similar studies, prevention of changes in markers indicative of
immune function (group C) could potentially also be interpreted using a two-step
argumentation if a change in these markers is described in the literature to be strongly
associated with negative health effects. If there is no established association with
clinically relevant outcomes, then the interpretation of the prevention of modulation of
an immune function marker (group D) out of the reference range is less easy, although it
could be positively perceived as an indication of increased resilience of homeostatic
control. Finally, if the prevented modulation out of the reference range indicates
clinical significance without evidence for the involvement of the immune system (group B
by itself), the effect is beneficial for health, but may not necessarily be due to altered
immune function.

Scenario 5: nutrition induces a significant modulation of a marker from a less
favourable reference range into the reference range of a comparator group with a more
favourable immune function
In this scenario, changes in markers are compared with the reference range of a
population with a more favourable health profile. This reference range has been linked
through a plausible mechanism to one or more immune functions. Typical examples would be
to restore markers in elderly individuals to levels in healthy adults, in (overtrained)
athletes back to normal ranges, and in more disease-prone shift workers to levels in less
disease-prone controls with an undisturbed biorhythm; to move markers from atopic to
normal ranges; or to shift markers of bottle-fed infants to normal ranges for breast-fed
infants. Again, changes in markers indicative of clinical relevance or clearly established
association with a plausible underlying mechanism are key to interpretation. In the case
of immune function markers that also indicate clinical relevance (group A) or concomitant
changes in plausibly linked group B and C markers, the interpretation is straightforward.
For instance, if the responsiveness to vaccination in an elderly population shows
increases to the range typically found for younger adults, this will be considered as
beneficial. Likewise, reduction of elevated CRP levels in elderly individuals to ranges
observed in healthy adults would be considered beneficial because lower levels of CRP have
been associated with better survival.

Beyond individual immune function markers
In most nutrition intervention studies, (large) sets of immune function markers are
assessed and the interpretation of intervention effects will depend on the consistency of
the changes observed. If related immune function markers show consistent changes, the
interpretation will be easy and will follow the same logic as for individual markers. For
instance, if composite markers such as ratios of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines,
ratios of distinct T-helper cell subset-related activation markers or cytokines, or a
specified immune (risk) profile can be defined before the study, then reference ranges can
be determined for these composite markers and nutrition-related changes relative to these
ranges can help guide the interpretation as described for individual markers above.

If changes in related markers are not consistent, interpretation is greatly helped by good
clinical practices that include the a priori definition of the most
important ‘lead markers’ (typically groups A and B). The interpretation would be based on
changes in these lead markers combined with mechanistic insights that may help to interpret
the differential effects observed on the other markers. This could lead to the formulation
of a new hypothesis that could then be tested in a new study specifically designed to test
this hypothesis. Patterns or composite markers that are less well defined before the study,
including those emerging from the untargeted use of high-content multiplexed or -omics
approaches, are more difficult to interpret within this conceptual framework. However, such
approaches could lead to the identification of pathways involved and can help to formulate
specific hypotheses that can then be tested in more targeted follow-up studies.

It is thus advisable to define a priori a cluster of the most important
markers that are predictive of clinical effects or can be used as supportive evidence of
clinical outcomes and that will aid in the eventual interpretation of the outcome of the
intervention. These may be complemented with secondary parameters that present a profile
that is indicative of a certain endpoint that may help in the interpretation of the
mechanisms underlying potential changes in primary outcomes.

The same principles as described above for nutritional intervention studies may apply to
other types of interventions and, with some caution, to observational studies exploring the
relevance of (nutritional) differences between groups.

Conclusions and recommendations
The overall aim of this article is to provide further guidance for the assessment and
interpretation of immune modulation by nutrition in the general population. To this end,
criteria were defined to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of symptoms and markers to
measure changes in immune function. The markers were evaluated for three distinct domains of
immune function: defence against pathogens; avoidance or mitigation of allergy; control of
(low-grade) metabolic inflammation. Graded criteria were applied to over seventy-five immune
function markers that were rated based on the different scores for their overall usefulness
(Tables 2 and 3). Not surprisingly, it was found that markers that involve the standardised
assessment of relevant symptoms (e.g. symptoms of common infections or allergies) or
in vivo responses to a defined challenge with antigens or allergens (e.g.
response to vaccination or allergen provocation) provide the most useful indication to
interpret the modulation of immune function. Other useful markers include selected
ex vivo markers of particular immune functions (e.g. NK-cell activity,
phagocytosis and responsiveness of specific T-cell subpopulations) and selected basal
markers essential in the exertion of critical immune functions, such as mucosal IgA for
infection resistance, allergen-sIgE and tryptase for avoidance or mitigation of allergy, and
CRP and inflammatory mediators to indicate low-grade inflammation.

A selection of the most useful markers were further classified depending on whether a
change in the markers by itself conclusively indicates clinical relevance and/or involvement
of altered immune function. Group A markers indicating both clinical relevance and
involvement of immune function include pathogen- and vaccine-specific immune responses, DTH
and contact hypersensitivity responses and mucosal IgA responses for defence against
pathogens and for avoidance or mitigation of allergy-specific responses to allergen
provocation, basophil activation and plasma tryptase. No group A markers were identified for
control of low-grade metabolic inflammation. The classification of allergen-sIgE was
controversial as some regard it to be a group A marker for allergy, whereas others are less
convinced of its clinical relevance in the absence of symptoms in the general population.
Group B markers demonstrating clinical relevance, but not necessarily the involvement of
immune function(s), include symptoms of infections and pathogen load for defence against
pathogens as well as symptoms of allergy and response to general food or lactose provocation
for allergy and insulin resistance and blood pressure as rather unspecific symptoms
associated with low-grade metabolic inflammation. Several ex vivo cellular
function assays associated with clinically relevant effects in (sub)groups of the general
population and indicating the involvement of immune function(s) were clustered as group C.
In addition, CRP and inflammatory markers were put into this category for their role in the
control of low-grade inflammation, and some argue that sIgE should also fit into this
category for avoidance or mitigation of allergy. This group also comprises in
vivo responses to pro-inflammatory challenges, which are considered promising
markers for control of low-grade metabolic inflammation, but direct evidence for their
clinical relevance remains to be established. Further optimisation, validation and inclusion
of such challenge tests in prospective studies should be a high priority, as there are
currently no other markers specifically indicating clinical relevance for the modulation of
low-grade metabolic inflammation, hampering possibilities to design studies to demonstrate
benefits of improved inflammatory control. Finally, group D contains all other immune
function markers that can help to provide mechanistic insights, but for which the clinical
relevance is currently unclear.

Clearly, there is no gold standard of immune function that can be recommended for all
studies assessing the effects of nutrition on immune function in the general population. It
is, therefore, proposed to first define the functional domain of interest and then select
(combinations of) markers that indicate clinical relevance and for which a plausible
hypothesis explaining how they could be related is available. For instance, to test the
effect on resistance to pathogens, one could assess the response to a vaccination or combine
the assessment of endpoints with specific responsiveness to an experimental infection.
Alternatively, symptoms of natural infections could be assessed alongside with markers of
immune function likely to be involved mechanistically. If the aim of the study is to test
effects on mitigation of allergy, one could focus on provocation tests using specific
allergens or combine the assessment of allergic symptoms with contributing group C or D
markers. Finally, for control of low-grade metabolic inflammation, one could select a
combination of markers including responsiveness to inflammatory challenge, CRP and pro- and
anti-inflammatory mediators. However, it is important to realise that the clinical relevance
of these markers remains to be established in the general population.

To aid the interpretation of changes observed in (combinations of) immune function markers,
a framework was devised taking into account the type of marker and the changes observed
relative to a defined reference range. Within this framework, five different scenarios were
identified including (significant) modulation within the reference range (a very common
scenario for modulation due to nutrition), modulation from outside the reference range back
into the range, modulation from within the reference range out of the range, prevention of
modulation induced by other factors, and modulation into the reference range of a comparator
group with a more desired immune function (e.g. from values in bottle-fed infants to those
in breast-fed infants). Evidently, this framework does not neglect the need to consider the
quality of individual studies and consistency of effects and to consider that ultimate
conclusions must be based on the totality of evidence. However, working through the logical
steps of the proposed framework as presented in Fig.
4 indicates that selected (combinations of) markers can be used to reach clear
conclusions as to whether an observed modulation of immune function could be regarded as
beneficial within the functional domains of defence against pathogens and avoidance or
mitigation of allergy. For control of low-grade metabolic inflammation, this is more
difficult as there is a lack of specific markers linking altered immune function(s) to
clinical relevance in this domain. Clearly, it is possible to reach conclusions on
beneficial effects in situations of insulin resistance and high blood pressure. However,
since these are only very loosely associated with low-grade inflammation, it will be
challenging to firmly establish whether a concurrent modulation of (inflammatory) markers is
correlated.

Finally, it is important to stipulate that the selection of markers and the complete
approach are geared towards the assessment of effects on relevant physiological functions of
the immune system or markers indicating benefits or risks at the group level within the
general population. This is clearly distinct from the use of markers to diagnose or monitor
the progression of disease in individual patients. Moreover, the evaluation and
classification of markers indicated herein are based on an expert judgement of the authors,
partially validated by discussions at a workshop with a wider group of experts. Scores and
classification may be debated to some extent and conclusions for individual markers may
change over time as more robust data on the association with relevant clinical outcomes in
the general population become available. More importantly, the structured stepwise approach
that was followed offers a rationale for selecting markers for future trials and helps to
provide a framework for the interpretation of outcomes. In fact, a similar stepwise approach
may also be useful to rationalise the selection and interpretation of markers for other
physiological processes that are critical to the maintenance of health and well-being in the
general population.
