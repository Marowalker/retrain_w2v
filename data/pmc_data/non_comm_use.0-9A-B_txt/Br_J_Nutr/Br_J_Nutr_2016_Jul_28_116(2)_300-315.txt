health policies to promote better food behaviours. The aim of this study was to identify
the major dietary patterns in the French adult population and to determine their main
demographic, socio-economic, nutritional and environmental characteristics. Dietary
patterns were defined from food consumption data collected in the second French national
cross-sectional dietary survey (2006–2007). Non-negative-matrix factorisation method,
followed by a cluster analysis, was implemented to derive the dietary patterns. Logistic
regressions were then used to determine their main demographic and socio-economic
characteristics. Finally, nutritional profiles and contaminant exposure levels of dietary
patterns were compared using ANOVA. Seven dietary patterns, with specific food consumption
behaviours, were identified: ‘Small eater’, ‘Health conscious’, ‘Mediterranean’, ‘Sweet
and processed’, ‘Traditional’, ‘Snacker’ and ‘Basic consumer’. For instance, the
Health-conscious pattern was characterised by a high consumption of low-fat and light
products. Individuals belonging to this pattern were likely to be older and to have a
better nutritional profile than the overall population, but were more exposed to many
contaminants. Conversely, individuals of Snacker pattern were likely to be younger,
consumed more highly processed foods, had a nutrient-poor profile but were exposed to a
limited number of food contaminants. The study identified main dietary patterns in the
French adult population with distinct food behaviours and specific demographic,
socio-economic, nutritional and environmental features. Paradoxically, for better dietary
patterns, potential health risks cannot be ruled out. Therefore, this study demonstrated
the need to conduct a risk–benefit analysis to define efficient public health policies
regarding diet.

Relationships between diet and health have already been strongly established in the
literature(

1

,

2

). Accordingly, the consumption of some foods (e.g. red meat, fruits, fish,
alcohol, etc.) or some nutrients (e.g. SFA, Na, K, etc.) is generally associated with an
increased or decreased risk of many chronic diseases such as obesity(

3

–

5

), hypertension(

6

–

8

), CVD(

6

,

9

–

11

) or certain cancers(

12

–

14

).

The standard approach for exploring these risk–benefit relationships has been to focus on one
specific food or one nutrient without considering the diet as a whole(

15

). However, it is necessary to consider the potential interactions or synergistic
effects between foods or nutrients in order to depict the overall effect of diet on
health(

15

–

17

). Multidimensional approaches, such as the identification of dietary patterns,
thus allow the estimation of more reliable associations between diet and health, taking into
account the overall diet and its complexity(

18

–

20

). Moreover, the nutritional and socio-economic characterisation of dietary
patterns can be used to define practical public health policies to promote better food
behaviours in specific groups of consumers(

21

,

22

). From an environmental health perspective, dietary patterns can finally
contribute to identify the most exposed consumers to a series of food contaminants(

23

).

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in studying national diets using a
multidimensional approach(

20

,

24

). The standard approaches applied were principal factor analyses, such as
principal component analysis (PCA), multi-component analysis or cluster analysis (e.g.
hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA))(

18

,

25

,

26

). In France, only a few studies have investigated dietary patterns at a national
level using multifactorial methods(

27

–

30

), and only one, to our knowledge, from a representative sample of the French
population(

29

). Although these studies have provided comparable results, the lack of homogeneity
of the methods performed and differences in the study population make comparisons difficult.
Besides, standard approaches are not really suitable for constructing dietary patterns because
of the inherent structure of the data. For instance, food consumption data include a
significant number of zeros because of non-consumption of certain categories of foods and only
have positive values. Hence, the assumption of a Gaussian distribution may not be valid(

31

). Moreover, the approaches usually used show poor fit because of non-negative data
and the excess of zero values, generally termed ‘sparse data’(

32

). Lee & Seung(

33

) proposed a new latent-variable-based method, the negative matrix factorisation
(NMF) method, specifically adapted to sparse and non-negative data. This method has already
been proven to be effective in food risk assessment to identify dietary patterns or chemical
mixtures(

23

,

34

,

35

).

The major aim of this study was thus to identify the main dietary patterns in the French
adult population using the NMF approach and the food consumption data of a nationally
representative survey (the second French national cross-sectional dietary survey (INCA2)).
Next, we determined their main demographic and socio-economic characteristics and assessed
their nutritional and environmental profiles in order to highlight their specific features.
The dietary patterns revealed in this work will thus give an overview of the different food
consumption behaviours in the French adult population, according to distinct dimensions.

Methods
Study population
The French INCA2 survey was carried out between December 2005 and May 2007 by the French
Food Safety Agency(

36

). This cross-sectional survey was initially designed to assess food intake in
a nationally representative sample of the French population. Two independent random
samples of 3- to 17-year-old children and 18- to 79-year-old adults were drawn using a
multistage cluster sampling technique. The complex sampling frame was established from the
national census, published by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic
Studies (INSEE), and it has been described elsewhere(

37

,

38

). In brief, 181 geographical units, stratified by region of residence and size
of urban area, were first randomly selected with a probability proportional to size. Then,
households were randomly drawn within each primary sampling unit, and two independent
sampling frames were set up: one restricted to households including at least one child and
the other including households with or without children. Last, within each household,
either a child or an adult was randomly selected. Participation rates were 63 % for adults
and 69 % for children, yielding samples of 2624 adults and 1455 children, respectively. To
ensure the national representativeness of each sample, a weighting factor for unequal
sampling probabilities for differential non-responses by region, agglomeration size, age,
sex, occupation of the household head, size of the household and season has been assigned
to each individual. These variables were selected for adjustment because of high
discrepancy between their distribution among the INCA2 sample and among the French
population, using an external source (Labour force survey 2005-INSEE)(

36

,

39

) (distribution among the adult sample is presented in the online Supplementary
Table S1). The low variability of the weighting factor for adults (mean of 1 and a
sd of 0·7) demonstrated the good representativeness of the INCA2 adult sample
compared with the French general adult population.

Only adults were considered in this study. As recommended by the European Food Safety
Authority, under-reporting subjects (i.e. those who, voluntarily or not, under-reported
amounts consumed; 26·9 % of adult sample) were identified and included in the statistical
analyses(

40

). Besides, twenty-four subjects (0·9 % of the adult sample) with an extremely
low total energy intake (TEI) were excluded from the final sample (estimated from the
following formula: 
(

41

).

The INCA2 survey was approved by the French Data Protection Authority (Commission
Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés) and the French National Council
for Statistical Information (Conseil National de l’Information
Statistique).

Data
Collection of data on food consumption
Dietary intake was assessed using a 7-d food record. A trained and certified
investigator delivered at home the food record with a self-administered questionnaire
and explained to the subjects how to complete them. The investigator returned to the
home immediately after the week to check the accuracy of the information reported in
both documents. Each day of the food record was divided into three main meals
(breakfast, lunch and dinner) and three between-meal snacks. The subjects were asked to
describe as precisely as possible the nature and the amount of all foods and beverages
consumed during the survey week. Consumed quantities were estimated using the SU.VI.MAX
(SUpplémentation en VItamines et en MInéraux AntioXydants)
photographic booklet(

42

) or expressed directly in weight or in household measures (e.g. spoon).

Foods and beverages declared were subsequently allocated a food code including 1280
food items and were categorised into forty-three food groups and 121 subgroups. McCann
et al.(

43

) and preliminary analyses (data not shown) showed that the quality of the
description of dietary patterns is strongly affected by the level of aggregation of
foods. To obtain a satisfactory trade-off between the level of detail to discriminate
individuals according to their food consumption and the difficulty in exploring a large
data set by factorial analysis, the nomenclature was modified step-by-step for this
study and the 1280 food items were finally reclassified into seventy-four new food
groups (Table 1). This classification was based
on the foods’ nutritional composition and results of previous analyses (data not shown).
Eight food groups (i.e. wholegrain pasta/rice/wheat, whole milk, skimmed milk, sweetened
milk, low-fat cheese, dried fruit, nectar, soft drinks with fruit) with a consumption
rate <10 % were excluded to avoid excessive noise in the data, which could lead
to underline too particular and isolated dietary behaviours(

,

Individual characteristics
Individual demographic and socio-economic variables were collected using face-to-face
questionnaires and self-reported data. Questionnaires provided information on individual
occupational status, education level and household wealth. Household wealth was defined
through questions on the household income and other related variables such as ‘having gone
away on holiday for more than 4 d within the last 12 months’, ‘the number of cars in the
household’, ‘the number of domestic electrical appliances’, ‘how the financial situation
is perceived’, ‘financial access to desired food products’, ‘whether the idea of lacking
food would be a concern’, ‘giving up health care for financial reasons’ and ‘housing
occupancy status’. A wealth index was derived from a correspondence analysis as already
done by Fillol et al.(

46

) on variables describing household wealth (cited above). From the
correspondence analysis, the score of each subject on the first principal component was
used as the summary wealth index, which was divided into tertiles. In addition, for this
study and according to Darmon et al.(

47

), an individual was considered as living in a household experiencing food
insecurity for financial reasons if she/he declared not having enough to eat (often or
sometimes) because of economic reasons. Respondents were also asked to report other
information such as age, sex, household composition, region and size of municipality in
which the household was located. The variables and associated categories are described in
the supporting information (online Supplementary Table S2).

Nutritional composition data
Nutritional intake was estimated by matching the French Food Composition database for
the year 2008(

48

,

49

) to the individual food consumption data. The individual average daily
intake of macronutrients (i.e. total energy content, total carbohydrates, simple
carbohydrates, total fats, SFA, proteins, alcohol, fibres and salt), minerals (i.e. Ca,
Fe, Na, Mg, K) and vitamins (i.e. vitamins A, C, E, B1, B6,
B9) was thus determined.

Food contamination data
Food contamination data were provided by the Second French Total Diet Study (TDS2). The
TDS2 was conducted between 2006 and 2010 to evaluate the exposure of the French
population to various substances that are likely to be found in foods ‘as consumed’.
This study collected 20 000 food products, representing 212 types of food, for which 445
substances of interest were investigated. Food sampling was based on the data from the
INCA2 survey, covering about 90 % of dietary consumption in the adult and child
populations(

50

). The 212 foods selected were linked to the INCA2 nomenclature. Of the 445
substances analysed, ten chemical substances, for which toxicological risk could not be
excluded, were considered in this study(

50

): trace elements (i.e. Pb, Al, Cd, inorganic As, organic Hg), acrylamide,
one mycotoxin (i.e. deoxynivalenol (DON) and its acetylated derivatives),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)/dioxins (i.e. non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls
(NDL-PCB), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans and
dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl) and one additive (sulphites). The individual
average daily exposure levels to the ten substances were estimated by combining
individual food consumption data and contamination data from the food sample analysis,
considering the same hypotheses as those described in the TDS2 report(

51

,

52

).

Statistical analyses
Identification of dietary patterns
The NMF method was applied to the data set composed of the 2600 individual daily intake
(g/d) of the sixty-six food groups. The analysis was performed on the overall adult
population because similar dietary patterns were identified separately in men and women
(data not shown). To account for individual weight in pattern identification, the
iterative least squares (LS)-NMF algorithm developed by Wang et
al.(

53

) and based on that described by Lee & Seung(

33

) was used. The goal of this factorial analysis is to summarise the
information available in food consumption data into an optimal number k
of consumption systems (CS)(

23

,

34

,

35

). In contrast to the PCA technique, each CS
k in the NMF is defined as a positive linear combination of foods, which are
generally associated in the same diet. Thus, all CS
k describe the different associations of foods within the population. For each
CS
k, each food group had a coefficient that can be interpreted as the contribution of
this food group to the construction of the system CS
k. The weight of each CS
k in each individual’s total diet was also determined. The diet of an individual is
thus represented by a combination of different CS
k.

To implement the NMF method, an optimal number of CS must be chosen. In this study, it
was selected according to the quality of the interpretation of the CS (relevancy and
ease of interpretation) and a graphical approach as done in Béchaux et
al.(

23

) and Sy et al.(

35

). Finally, a HCA was conducted to identify individuals with similar
combinations of CS, defining a dietary pattern. The scores of each individual on the CS
selected were used as input to the HCA. This classical clustering method consists of a
step-by-step aggregation of individuals or groups of individuals who combined the CS in
a similar way(

54

), leading to one single class that includes the entire population. The
number of clusters to retain was based on the inter-cluster inertia:total inertia ratio
and the interpretability of the different clusters.

For each dietary pattern, the relative contribution (%) of each CS
k was calculated (i.e. among individuals within the same dietary pattern, the
contribution of the CS
k is the ratio between the sum of weights of the CS
k and the sum of the weights of all the CS). The CS that best describes each
pattern was identified according to the V test indicator, which compares the average
weight of the CS
k in one dietary pattern with the average weight of the CS
k in the whole population(

55

,

56

). The CS
k with significant and positive V tests were used to describe dietary patterns.

Characterisation of the dietary patterns
Demographic and socio-economic characteristics of each dietary pattern were
investigated using binomial logistic regression. Each tested model identified the main
demographic and socio-economic determinants of each dietary pattern independently of the
others, by comparing with the overall population. Variables considered were age, level
of education, wealth index, household size, household composition, occupational status,
region, food insecurity and municipality size. These factors were selected because of
their significant associations with the dietary patterns in univariate analysis (data
not shown), as well as the consistent associations between dietary intake and these
demographic and socio-economic determinants(

57

–

61

). All analyses were performed among men and women separately in order to
take into account the significant interaction observed between sex and other factors
(data not shown).

The mean nutrient intake was calculated for each dietary pattern. The association
between nutritional intake and dietary patterns was assessed using ANOVA, and specific
nutrient intake was identified by comparing the mean of each dietary pattern with the
overall mean. All models were controlled for age, sex, season, TEI, level of education,
wealth index, occupational status, household size, food insecurity, household
composition, municipality size and region. As previously mentioned, these covariates
were selected on preliminary analyses and previous studies(

57

–

61

).

Diet quality indices can evaluate the overall diet of an individual based on the
following: (i) nutrient indicators, which reflect the adequacy to nutritional
requirements; and (ii) foods to assess the variety of food intake(

62

,

63

). Three scores were selected to illustrate the overall quality of the diet:
the energy density (ED) of the diet(

64

), the mean adequacy ratio (MAR)(

65

) and the dietary diversity score (DDS)(

66

). The ED was used as an indicator of bad nutritional quality. Low ED has
been shown to have a good nutritional quality(

67

), and a decrease of ED of the diet is recommended by several public health
authorities to prevent obesity(

68

,

69

). For this study, ED was calculated for each individual with respect to the
energy content (kJ/g (kcal/g)) of all foods consumed (except beverages such as water,
soft drinks, alcohol, milk, coffee, tea). The mean ED was assessed for each dietary
pattern. MAR was used as an indicator of good nutritional quality. The MAR represents
the nutritional adequacy of the diet. Multiple versions of this index have been related
to health indicators(

70

), as well to other diet quality indexes(

71

–

73

). It was calculated as the mean percentage of the French daily recommended
intake for twenty keys nutrients (namely proteins, fibres, vitamins A, C, E, D,
B1, B2, B3, B6, B9,
B12, Ca, K, Fe, Mg, Zn, Cu, I and Se). Each ratio was truncated at 100, so
that a high intake of one nutrient could not compensate for the low intake of another:  where  is the individual nutrient intake of the nutrient n
and  is the French RDA for the nutrient, taking into account the age and
the sex of the individual(

65

). Besides, the diet diversity is also a key element of the high quality of
diets. A diverse diet increased the probability of nutrient adequacy(

74

), and it has been associated with positive health outcomes(

75

,

76

). DDS is defined as the number of specific food groups consumed over a
specific period(

66

,

77

). In this study, 3 d were randomly chosen for each subject: 2 weekdays and 1
weekend day. Five food groups were considered: dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese),
meat (red meat, poultry, fish and crustaceans), cereals (rice, pasta, wheat), fruits
(fresh fruit, processed fruit and dry fruit) and vegetables (fresh vegetables and
prepared vegetables). A food group was considered to have been consumed if at least 30 g
was ingested during the 3 d. A DDS score was calculated for each individual, and it
varied from 0 to 5. The mean DDS score was calculated for each pattern. Associations
between dietary patterns and diet quality scores were also assessed using ANOVA adjusted
for covariates, as described above. The mean of quality scores of each dietary pattern
was thus compared with the overall mean.

Finally, mean contaminant exposure levels were calculated for each dietary pattern.
Associations between dietary patterns and exposure levels were assessed using
ANOVA-adjusted covariates described above. On the basis of the ANOVA model, specific
exposure levels were identified by comparing the mean contaminant levels of each dietary
pattern with the overall mean.

All values were survey-weighted means. A P value of 0·05 was used as
the threshold of significance. All analyses were implemented in the software R version
3.0.2. The LS-NMF algorithm was implemented using the R package ‘NMF’(

78

). The package ‘Factominer’ was used to run the clustering(

55

). The package ‘Survey’ was used to account for the complex INCA2 sampling
frame design(

79

).

Results
Identification of dietary patterns
By combining graphical and interpretability criteria, seven distinct CS summarised the
consumption behaviours of the 2600 individuals with respect to the sixty-six food groups.
The inclusion of additional CS did not provide any further useful information for the
interpretation of the dietary patterns. Moreover, additional CS were difficult to
interpret, as they were composed of very few food groups (data not shown). Food groups
with a score ≥2·5 % were considered as main contributors to a CS. Table 2 shows the relative contribution of the main food groups
associated with each of the seven CS, designated as ‘Tradition’, ‘Snacking’,
‘Mediterranean’, ‘Simplicity’, ‘Dietetic’, ‘High-fat/sugar/salt’ and
‘Pleasant-and-convenient’ food behaviours. No strong Pearson’s correlations
(<0·2715) were found between the different CS, suggesting that food behaviours
related to each CS were independent of each other.Table 2 Food consumption characteristics of each dietary pattern

Then, seven dietary patterns with homogeneous CS combinations were identified and named
according to their food consumption patterns. The major CS that best described each
dietary pattern were identified and presented in Table
2. In brief, the first dietary pattern called ‘Small eater’ represented 23·0 % of
the population. It consisted of consumers who used all the CS but to a lesser extent than
the overall population, which means that they consumed all foods but in a lower quantity
than the overall population. The second dietary pattern called ‘Health conscious’ grouped
12·6 % of the population and was characterised by individuals who used the dietetic CS
significantly more than the overall population, which was mainly associated with low-fat
or light foods, soups, fruits, tea and herbal tea and, paradoxically, cakes and pastries.
The third dietary pattern, named ‘Mediterranean’, grouped 13·0 % of the population and was
represented by individuals who used the Mediterranean CS significantly more than the
overall population, which was characterised by unprocessed foods (vegetables, oil, herbs
and spices, unprocessed fish, unprocessed fruit, etc.) and dairy products (condiments and
cold dips (not low-fat), yogurt and cottage cheese (30–40 % fat)). Individuals in the
fourth dietary pattern called ‘Sweet and processed’ grouped 13·5 % of the population. This
pattern was characterised by food behaviour represented by the Pleasant-and-convenient CS
characterised by an association of sweetened products such as breakfast cereals, fruit
juices, chocolate bars/confectionery, dairy desserts and meals easy to prepare such as
puff pastries, quiches, warm sauces, cereal-based mixed dishes, etc. The fifth dietary
pattern identified as ‘Traditional’ accounted for 16·5 % of the population and was
represented by individuals who followed the Tradition CS significantly more than the
overall population and the High-fat/sugar/salt CS. Individuals in this pattern were
therefore characterised by a consumption of foods such as alcohol (in particular wine),
processed meat, cheese, bread products with wheat flour, coffee, red meat, but also
crackers, confectionery without chocolate, grains and nuts, cakes and pastries, and
sweetened biscuits, which characterised the High-fat/sugar/salt CS. The sixth pattern,
identified as ‘Snacker’, was represented by 11·5 % of the population and was characterised
by individuals who followed the Snacking CS, mainly represented by take-away products such
as sandwiches, pizza, sodas and colas, puff pastries (such as ham puff pastry, ‘bouchée à
la reine’, etc.) and processed foods such as processed potato products and cereal-based
mixed dishes (as spaghetti carbonara, pasta gratin, etc.). This pattern also followed the
High-fat/sugar/salt CS more than the overall population. The last dietary pattern called
‘Basic consumer’ accounted for 10·0 % of the population and was characterised by
individuals who followed the Simplicity CS, which associated mostly simple foods such as
butter/other animal fat, refined pasta/rice/wheat, unprocessed potatoes, yogurt and
cottage cheese (20 % fat), bread and bread products (including bread, loaf and rusk).

Characterisation of dietary patterns
OR and 95 % from logistic regressions are detailed in the Table 3 for men and women separately. Regardless of sex, the
probability of belonging to the Health-conscious and Mediterranean dietary patterns (only
for men in Traditional pattern) increased with age, conversely to the probability of
belonging to the Sweet-and-processed and Snacker dietary patterns. In addition, both women
and men in the Health-conscious pattern were more likely to have a higher wealth index, as
well as women from the Mediterranean pattern. In contrast, men in the Snacker pattern were
more likely to have a relatively low wealth index. Women from the Traditional and
Small-eater patterns were more likely to have a low educational level conversely to women
from the Mediterranean pattern. Women belonging to the Traditional, Snacker or
Health-conscious dietary patterns were more likely to live in households experiencing food
insecurity, compared with women from the Small-eater, Mediterranean and
Sweet-and-processed dietary patterns. Among men, individuals from the Sweet-and-processed
dietary pattern were more likely to live in households experiencing food insecurity,
conversely to men belonging to the Traditional and Small-eater dietary patterns. The
Mediterranean and Snacker dietary patterns had a higher probability of living in large
towns or cities.Table 3 Demographic and socio-economic determinants of each dietary pattern by sex (Odds

Nutritional intake for each dietary pattern is shown in 
Table 4. The energy intake was lower
than the overall population for the Small-eater but higher for the Sweet-and-processed,
Traditional and Basic-consumer dietary patterns. These three latter dietary patterns were
also characterised by higher intake of SFA, mainly because of a higher consumption of
savoury or sweet pastries, chocolate for Sweet-and-processed pattern and higher
consumption of animal products (i.e. butter, cream, cheese or red meat) for Traditional
and Basic-consumer patterns. The Health-conscious and Mediterranean dietary patterns had
higher intake of fibres than the overall population, primarily because of a higher
consumption of fruits, vegetables and wholemeal bread (for Health-conscious pattern only),
leading also to higher intake of many minerals and vitamins than the overall population.
In addition, Sweet-and-processed pattern showed higher intake of some minerals and
vitamins, probably because of a higher consumption of fruits juice and breakfast cereals
(which are, for most of them, fortified). Conversely, the Small-eater, Snacker,
Traditional and Basic-consumer dietary patterns showed intake of almost all mineral and
vitamins studied, which was lower than the overall population. Only the Traditional and
Health-conscious dietary patterns had higher intake of Na than the overall population,
primarily because of a high consumption of cheese and processed meat and a high
consumption of wholemeal bread and bottled water for each pattern, respectively.

Scores of nutritional quality (DDS, MAR, ED) were significantly different across dietary
patterns (Table 4). Mostly because of an
insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables, the Traditional and Snacker dietary patterns
showed significantly lower DDS values than the overall population; 20·4 and 30·7 % of
individuals from the Traditional and Snacker dietary patterns, respectively, had a DDS
value of 4, and 13·5 and 6·3 %, respectively, had a DDS value of 3 (data not shown).
Conversely, the Health-conscious and Mediterranean dietary patterns consumed at least 30 g
of dairy products, meat, cereals, fruits and vegetables over 3 d, leading to higher DDS
values than the overal population; 95 and 92 % of consumers, respectively, had a DDS value
of 5 (data not shown). The MAR, a composite indicator for nutrient adequacy, was higher
than the mean in the overall population for individuals from the Health-conscious and
Mediterranean dietary patterns, as well as for Sweet-and-processed and Basic-consumer
dietary patterns. Individuals from the Health-conscious and Mediterranean patterns, who
consumed higher amounts of foods with high nutritional density and low ED, such as fruits,
vegetables and unprocessed fish, had also a lower ED than the overall population. ED was
higher than the mean in the overall population for the Small-eater, Traditional and
Snacker dietary patterns, patterns for which the MAR was significantly lower than the
overall population.Table 4 Nutrient intake and diet quality indicators of each by dietary pattern

For the ten substances considered in this study, Table
5 gives the mean exposure levels for each dietary pattern. Except for acrylamide
and DON and its derivatives, the Snacker dietary pattern was significantly less exposed
than the overall population for all substances studied. This result can be attributed to
relatively low consumption of foods that are recognised as contributors to substance
exposure. On the contrary, the Health-conscious and Mediterranean dietary patterns were
more exposed than the overall population to numerous substances. For instance, these
patterns showed the highest exposure level to Pb, primarily because of higher consumption
of water and hot drinks. Furthermore, as a result of their higher consumption of
vegetables, individuals from the Health-conscious and Mediterranean dietary patterns were
more exposed to Al than the overall population. The Health-conscious dietary pattern was
also more exposed to PCB-NDL, primarily because of higher consumption of fish and fish
products. The Basic-consumer dietary pattern was also significantly more exposed than the
overall population to Cd, because of higher consumption of bread products, and to PCB-NDL,
mostly because of high consumption of butter and other dairy products. Because of their
high consumption of alcohol (mainly wine), individuals belonging to the Traditional
dietary pattern were more exposed to sulphites than the overall population.Table 5 Contaminant exposure levels of each dietary pattern (Survey-weighted means and

Discussion
This study identified seven main dietary patterns in the adult population in France, with
very distinct food consumption behaviours. These patterns reflected specific nutritional
intake and food contaminant exposure levels, as well as particular demographic and
socio-economic determinants. According to their CS composition, these patterns were named
Small eater, Health conscious, Mediterranean, Sweet and processed, Traditional, Snacker and
Basic consumer. The results of this study were consistent with other studies, both national
and international. Indeed, the patterns reported as reproducible in the review of Newby
& Tucker(

80

) (Healthy, Western, Alcohol/Drinker, and Sweets/Dessert) are similar to some
patterns we observed here. Nevertheless, although some patterns were comparable across
populations (in many diverse countries and continent), there was natural variation in food
consumption, which can be partly attributed to the specificity of French food culture.

First of all, two dietary patterns in particular are consistently reported in
industrialised countries: one is less healthful and designated as a ‘Western-style’ pattern,
and the other is more healthful and called the ‘Prudent’ pattern(

18

,

24

,

81

,

82

). First, the Western-style pattern generally features high consumption of bread,
red and processed meat, starchy foods and high-fat products and is relatively similar to the
patterns described as Traditional and Basic-consumer in this study. However, some
disparities remained. On one hand, the Basic-consumer pattern was also characterised by a
higher consumption of basic and unprocessed foods (egg, unprocessed potatoes, pulses) than
the overall population with relatively high consumption of dairy products (cream, yogurt and
butter), which may specifically reflect an older French model(

27

,

83

). On the other hand, high consumption of alcoholic drinks (in particular wine),
observed in our Traditional dietary pattern, is not particularly noticed for the ‘Western’
diet. Other French studies have revealed an Alcohol/meat dietary pattern, but distinctive
only in its amount of alcohol and meat consumed(

28

,

84

,

85

). Our Traditional pattern seems to reflect at least one aspect of the French
culinary culture, with its strong attachment for conviviality, and pleasure of eating(

83

,

86

). The dietary behaviours of these two ‘Western-like’ dietary patterns led to
less healthy nutritional intake, with high energy and SFA intake and low vitamins and
minerals intake. Individuals from these patterns were likely to have a lower socio-economic
status. The results tend to support the assumption, often reported in the literature, that
consumption is strongly influenced by socio-economic status and notably confirm a strong
relationship between a higher consumption of energy-dense foods (such as fried products,
cereals, potatoes, meat and meat products) and a lower socio-economic status(

87

–

89

). Second, the Mediterranean and Health-conscious patterns were comparable to the
‘Prudent’ pattern, commonly identified in the literature. The name Mediterranean was chosen
following the definition of a Mediterranean diet in the literature, such as a high
consumption of whole grains and carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, fish, olive oil, legumes
and low to moderate amounts of saturated animal fats, red meat and wine(

90

,

91

). Effectively, our Mediterranean pattern was characterised by a high consumption
of fruits, vegetables, fish and oil, of which 56 % was olive oil (against 52 % in the
overall population). Moreover, the Mediterranean Diet Score proposed by Trichopoulou
et al.(

92

) has been calculated for each individual and confirmed the existence of this
Mediterranean pattern among the French adult population (data not shown). Nevertheless, our
Mediterranean pattern was not characterised by a high consumption of legumes and whole-grain
products, as described in the literature(

90

,

91

). Similar patterns have also been identified in other French studies(

28

,

29

,

84

), but which were also characterised by high consumption of breakfast cereals,
which was not observed in this study. The Health-conscious pattern describes individuals who
ate more dietetic products. Few studies have identified a group of consumers characterised
by high consumption of dietary products(

93

,

94

). The consumption of diet products appeared long before the INCA2 study – that
is in the 1980s(

95

); thus, the identification of such a pattern was probably because of the level
of aggregation of foods chosen in this study, which identified diet products separately.
Consumers in both these dietary patterns seemed to have the most nutritious dietary
behaviour with a nutrient-dense diet, a higher MAR and higher consumption of foods with low
ED. These dietary patterns were associated with higher socio-economic status, which support
the association between a higher socio-economic status and so-called healthy foods, such as
wholemeal cereal-based products, fruits and vegetables or fish already identified in the
literature(

87

,

88

).

In addition, we identified two patterns (Snacker and Sweet and processed) characterised by
a high consumption of processed and modern foods (i.e. easy to prepare and to eat). Only one
such pattern per study has generally been reported in the literature, either under the name
of Processed/Unhealthy foods, characterised by the high consumption of high-energy beverages
and savoury snacks(

29

,

93

), or Sweets(

96

–

98

), with a high consumption of dairy desserts and sweet products. These two
profiles were both characterised by high energy intake and SFA intake. Conversely to the
description of the pattern ‘Sweet foods and breakfast cereal’ identified by Hearty
et al.(

93

) among Irish adults, individuals in the Sweet-and-processed dietary pattern also
had higher intake in some vitamins and minerals than the overall population, probably
because of a higher consumption of fruits juices and fortified breakfast cereals. In both
these dietary patterns, they were more likely to be younger, which confirms the negative
association observed by Adams & White(

99

) between age and energy from ultra-processed foods (i.e. ready-to-eat,
convenient and accessible foods such as breakfast cereals, biscuits, mixed dishes, pizza,
etc.).

Finally, the Small-eater dietary pattern in our study was characterised by a significantly
lower consumption of all foods compared with the overall population, with lower intake of
micronutrients. To our knowledge, only two studies identified a similar pattern, but these
studies were performed among an elderly population(

100

,

101

). In our study, although no association was observed between this dietary
pattern and age, individuals belonging to the Small-eater pattern had a tendency to be older
(11, 17, 32, 21 and 19 % of individuals from the Small-eater pattern were 18–24, 25–34,
34–49, 50–64 and >64 years old, respectively; data not shown). Because the presence
of under-reporters might have suggested potential bias, their distribution was studied. In
fact, under-reporters did not represent the majority of individuals from this pattern (48 %
of individuals from the Small-eater pattern were identified as under-reporters), and,
consequently, those individuals who had lower energy intake than the overall population
could be considered as real small consumers.

As reported in other studies, dietary patterns can highlight the specific food habits,
preferences and availability of the countries(80,102). The multiplicity of
dietary patterns identified in this work clearly reflects the contradictory attitudes of the
French population toward food, such as health awareness, indulgence, pleasure, conviviality,
but also convenience and practicality(

103

,

104

). These different food consumption behaviours were also noticeable in the BMI,
as defined by the World Health Organization(

5

). For instance, profiles with ‘healthy’ food behaviour (i.e. the
Health-conscious and Mediterranean patterns) had a lower proportion of individuals
considered as overweight (32·8 and 29·1 %, respectively) or obese (13·0 and 10·9 %) than the
more ‘unhealthy’ profiles, such as the Traditional pattern (44 % of overweight and 15·5 % of
obese individuals).

One original aspect of our work was to focus, in addition to the nutritional quality of the
diet, on food contaminant exposure levels of each dietary pattern. Whereas Health-conscious
and Mediterranean dietary patterns seemed to have healthy dietary behaviours, these two
groups of consumers seemed to be more at risk for exposure to some chemical substances. In
comparison with health-based guidance values (HBGV)(

51

), the Health-conscious pattern was considered to be at risk for its exposure to
Pb, Cd, inorganic As and Al, and the Mediterranean pattern was identified to be at risk for
its exposure to Pb, inorganic As, organic Hg and NDL-PCB. Conversely, the Snacker pattern
had a higher ED, a lower MAR and, in comparison with recommended nutrient intake values, the
highest prevalence of inadequate nutrient intake (data not shown). However, according to the
HBGV, its exposure to the ten substances studied was not considered to match at-risk levels
(except for acrylamide exposure). Finally, our results suggest that diets should be analysed
further according to a risk:benefit ratio. Unfortunately, no comparison can be made here
because, to our knowledge, to date, no other study in the literature has characterised the
dietary patterns by levels of contaminant exposure.

Otherwise, this study shows that the novel factorial analysis used, the NMF, was well
adapted to determining dietary patterns and successfully summarised the precise variability
of food consumption in a given population. Moreover, by using an appropriate algorithm, this
is the first study on this topic for which individual sampling weight was taken into account
in the NMF to be representative of the French adult population(

23

,

34

). In contrast to PCA, for which dietary patterns are constructed based on an
opposition of ‘foods consumed’ and ‘non-consumed’, the NMF constructs food behaviour
patterns using only a positive association of foods, which may better reflect reality. In
addition, although it is well known that food consumption is a multidimensional phenomenon,
classical factorial analysis approaches mean that one dietary pattern corresponds to one
common underlying dimension (factor) of food consumption(

18

,

28

). With NMF, one dietary pattern can be represented by different CS. Thus, as an
example, consumers from the Traditional dietary pattern were characterised by foods
composing the Traditional CS (processed meat, alcoholic drinks, coffee, etc.) but also the
High-fat/sugar/salt CS (grains and nuts, crackers, etc.). Moreover, our study used different
levels of aggregation of foods and distinguished some dietary patterns that were previously
confounded in other studies and provided a better characterisation of those patterns. For
instance, Bertin et al.(

29

) identified five dietary patterns named Traditional, Diversified, Processed,
Prudent and Sandwiches using a PCA based on the average frequency of consumption of
forty-three food groups from the INCA2 survey. According to the foods that characterised the
dietary patterns, the Processed pattern was similar to the Snacker and Sweet-and-processed
patterns of this study, and the Prudent pattern was similar to the Health-conscious and
Mediterranean dietary patterns. Furthermore, the Processed pattern identified by Bertin
et al.(

29

) differed from the overall population only by the higher consumption of
sandwiches and lower consumption of other foods, whereas our Snacker dietary pattern
included individuals who consumed higher quantities of several foods (sandwiches, pizza,
sodas and colas, processed potato products, etc.) than the overall population. These
differences further demonstrate that the NMF provides a better characterisation of the
different food consumption behaviours.

Another major strength of this study was that it was based on two robust national studies.
First, the INCA2 survey was conducted on a large and representative sample of the French
adult population using a complex sampling frame design, with a robust collection of dietary
intake using a 7-d food record, as well as numerous variables relative to demographic and
socio-economic status(

37

). For the TDS2 study, a complex food sampling plan covering 90 % of the French
diet was designed, taking into account the seasonal nature of products and the regional
variations, leading to an accurate assessment of the population exposure at the national
level(

50

). In addition, the use of factorial analysis raises some concerns about the
degree of subjectivity involved in the analytical process (e.g. the determination of the
number of CS, the level of aggregation of foods, the determination of the number of patterns
identified). However, as highlighted in Newby & Tucker(

80

), the consistency and reproducibility with regard to other national and
international studies help to confirm the validity of our findings.

In conclusion, from the INCA2 survey, we identified seven distinct dietary patterns in the
French adult population, with specific demographic, socio-economic, nutritional and
environmental characteristics. These findings provide new information on the diversity of
food consumption in France and give an overview of the nutritional quality of the different
food consumption behaviours. From a public health perspective, our results provide
interesting insights for developing behaviourally targeted policies. In addition, because of
contradictory results for a given dietary pattern between high-quality nutritional intake
and high contaminant exposure levels (and vice versa), this study also demonstrates the
necessity to analyse the risks and the benefits of food consumption behaviours, particularly
in a public health context. Finally, the food consumption data were collected several years
ago (i.e. 2006–2007) and the third INCA survey is currently underway, potentially providing
the opportunity to assess the trends in dietary patterns at the national level.
