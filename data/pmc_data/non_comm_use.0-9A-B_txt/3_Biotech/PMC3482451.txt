various physico-chemical parameters. Imbalanced nutrient conditions were often found
to result in sporulation and low PHB production in Bacillus sp. In the present investigation, Bacillus mycoides DFC1 strain isolated from garden soil was studied
for PHB production in glucose–peptone broth. The effect of glucose/peptone ratio on
biomass yield, PHB production and sporulation was investigated. Central composite
rotatable design was used to study the interactive effects of three variables:
glucose, peptone and pH on cell growth and PHB production. The optimized medium
conditions with the constraint ‘to maximize’ cell growth and PHB content were
glucose 17.34 g/l, peptone 7.03 g/l at pH 7.3. A maximum dry cell weight of 4.35 g/l
and PHB yield of 3.32 g/l amounting to 76.32 % (w/w) of dry cell weight with
negligible sporulation at the end of 72 h resulted in a significant increase
(1.83–3.32 g/l or 1.82-fold) in the production of PHB in comparison to the medium
used in preliminary studies.

Introduction
Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable polyesters produced by bacteria
which are gaining importance as alternative biopolymers to petroleum-based plastics
due to their eco-friendly nature. Bacteria of different genera accumulate PHAs as
intracellular carbon and energy storage granules in response to growth media
containing excess carbon substrate and limited quantities of nitrogen source
(Anderson and Dawes 1990). They are
readily degraded by the depolymerases present in the environmental microflora
resulting in the formation of water and CO2 (Suriyamongkol et
al. 2007). Several Gram positive and
Gram negative bacteria are widely known to produce PHAs, however, only Gram negative
bacteria have been extensively studied. Bacteria such as Ralstonia eutropha (Cupriavidis
necator), Alcaligenes latus and
other methylotrophs accumulate PHA when cell growth is hampered due to the
limitation of nitrogen/phosphorous/magnesium/potassium/oxygen or sulphur in the
presence of excess carbon source (Doi 1990). The members of the genus Bacillus are reported to accumulate PHB during the growth phase (Borah
et al. 2002). PHAs can be subdivided
into three broad classes according to the size of monomers. PHAs containing up to C5
monomers are classified as short chain length PHAs (scl-PHA), whereas PHAs
containing carbon chain length in the range of C6–C14 and >C14 monomers are
classified as medium chain length (mcl-PHA) and long chain length (lcl-PHA) PHAs,
respectively (Rehm 2003). In comparison
to other PHAs, polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is too brittle to be used as plastic
material. Members of Pseudomonas sp., Aeromonas hydrophila as well as Bacillus sp. are reported to accumulate heteropolymers of short chain
length–medium chain length PHAs (scl-mcl PHA) such as P(3HB-co-3HV), P(3HB-co-3HHx)
and P(3HB-co-4HB) when substrates such as γ-butyrolactone or ε-caprolactone are
present in the growth medium as carbon source (Labuzeck and Radecka 2001). Unlike the Gram negative bacteria the
polymer produced by Bacillus sp. are free from
endotoxins and can be used for biomedical applications. These tailor-made
biosynthesized polymers are considered to exhibit better physical properties and can
find use as biodegradable food packaging materials, adhesives as well as
biocompatible materials for tissue engineering applications. B. circulans, B. licheniformis, B.
amyloliquefaciens, B. thuringiensis,
B. cereus UW85, B.
megaterium Y6, B. sphaericus ATCC
14577, B. coagulans and B. mycoides RLJB-017 were reported to produce PHAs in the range
11–69 %w/w of dry cell weight (Chen et al. 1991; Borah et al. 2002; Katricioglu et al. 2003; Yilmaz et al. 2005; Singh et al. 2009). Our experimental studies identified B. mycoides DFC1 also to accumulate poly (3HB-co-3HV) copolymer with
high hydroxyvalerate (-HV) content of 31.3 mol % (unpublished results). Although PHB
was first identified in Bacillus sp, until now
the large-scale PHB production using Bacillus sp.
has been met with limited success (Wu et al. 2001; Valappil et al. 2007). Bacillus sp. strains
endowed with rapid growth and ability to utilize a variety of readily available
cost-effective substrates is neglected due to the sporulation interfering with PHB
production (Wu et al. 2001). Few
studies have documented the accumulation of PHB in Bacillus sp. during the late log phase or early stationary phase;
however, the accumulated PHB was found to be degraded at the onset of sporulation
(Chen et al. 1991; McCool et al.
1996). An optimized medium might
enhance and maintain PHA content even at the instance of sporulation in Bacillus sp. The parameters such as the carbon (C) and
nitrogen (N) source as well as pH of the medium exert an influence on the metabolism
of these bacteria and accumulation of PHB (Wu et al. 2001). Response surface methodology (RSM) is an efficient tool used
to study the interactive effect of parameters involved in fermentation process
seeking optimized conditions for improved product yields (Montgomery 2005; Pal et al. 2010). In the present study Bacillus
mycoides DFC1, a growth-associated PHB-producing bacteria was grown
under conditions favoring PHB production and was investigated for sporulation.
Initial pH of the medium and the glucose/peptone (G/P) ratio was found to support the
stable PHB production without reduction in PHB biosynthesis. Few reports on the
optimization of PHB production from Bacillus sp.
has been documented (Valappil et al. 2007; Pandian et al. 2010); however, detailed studies on the correlation of the medium
composition and its pH favoring PHB production over sporulation are lacking. The aim
of the present study is to optimize PHB production and control the sporulation in
B. mycoides DFC1 for the enhanced PHB
production through statistical media optimization for its possible application in
scale-up studies.

Materials and methods
Microorganism
The PHB-producing bacterium used in the present study was isolated from garden
soil at Mysore, India. The strain was identified by sequencing the 1.4 kb of 16S
rRNA gene amplified using universal forward primer: 5′ AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTAG 3′ and
reverse primer: 5′ AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC 3′. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis was
carried out using NCBI-BLAST homology search (National centre for Biotechnology
Information http://www.ncbi.nml.nih.gov) program and identified the bacterium as Bacillus mycoides DFC1. The nucleotide sequence have been deposited
with NCBI database under the accession number GQ344802 (Aarthi and Ramana
2011). The glycerol stock culture
maintained at 4 °C was used for inoculum preparation.

Comparison of PHB production in different media
Three different media were investigated to determine the suitable composition
supporting maximum PHB accumulation by B.
mycoides DFC1. The media reported earlier by Ramsay et al.
(1990) and Tajima et al.
(2003), respectively, were compared
with modified glucose–peptone broth whose composition comprise/l: 10.0 g glucose,
5.0 g peptone and 5.0 g sodium chloride for PHB production. Three percent (v/v) of
the 18 h culture was used as inoculum in all experiments. The flasks were
incubated at 37 °C at 140 rpm for 48 h. The sporulation in the fermentation media
at the end of 48 h was determined as the number of heat-stable cells present after
heat treatment at 80 °C for 20 min according to Stevenson and Segner (2001).

Effect of culture conditions on PHB production
Based on the results from preliminary experiments, the glucose–peptone broth
(GPB) was used further to identify the appropriate glucose/peptone (G/P) ratio for PHB
production. The initial concentration of glucose was varied from 5.0 to 20.0 g/l
and the G/P
ratio of the medium was further adjusted to 1.5–15.0 by varying the concentration
of peptone for 15.0 g/l of glucose. The residual glucose was estimated by
3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid method (Somogyi 1952). Based on the preliminary ‘one-factor-at-a-time’
optimization method, the medium containing 3:1 (G/P) ratio with an initial pH 7.3
resulted in a maximum PHB production. This data was further used to fit in the
design of experiments for response surface optimization.

Experimental design and optimization
The optimization of process parameters in growth-associated PHB production by
B. mycoides DFC1 was studied using central
composite rotatable design (CCRD) of RSM (Stat-Ease, Inc Design Expert software,
trial version, 8.03, Minneapolis, USA). The CCRD for the three independent
variables: glucose (A, g/l), peptone (B, g/l) and pH (C)
each at five levels including 6 replicates at the center point, 6 axial points
(α = ±1.682) and 8 factor points leading to a
total number of 20 experiments was employed for optimization. Each variable was
studied at two different levels (−1, +1) and center point (0) which is the
midpoint of each factor range. Table 3
shows the minimum and maximum range of variables investigated and the full
experimental plan with respect to their actual and coded values. The experimental
results were fitted with a second-order polynomial function: 1  where, Y is the predicted response,
b0 the intercept,
b1, b2, b3 the linear coefficient, b11, b22, b33 the squared coefficient and b12, b13, b23 the interaction coefficient.

Data analysis
Design Expert 8.03 (Stat-Ease, Inc, Minneapolis, USA) was used for the data
analysis. The response surface model graphs were used to identify the effects of
linear, quadratic and interactive terms of the independent variables on the chosen
dependent variables. To validate the model, the average of each response (cell dry
weight and PHB content) was determined from the completely optimized medium
composition in duplicates. The statistical significance of the model was checked
by Fischer’s F test and the level of
significance was given as p value.

Extraction and characterization of PHB
The biomass was separated by centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 10 min and washed twice with double distilled water. The
biomass was kept in −20 °C overnight and later freeze dried under vacuum for 5 h
using Heto Dry winner model DW3 lyophilizer. The cell dry weight (cdw) measured in
grams per liter (g/l) of culture broth was determined from the lyophilized
biomass. The PHB extraction was carried out by dissolving dried biomass
preparations in equal volume of sodium hypochlorite (pH 12.0) and chloroform and
incubating the mixture at 37 °C for 1 h. The mixture was filtered and the PHB
content defined as the ratio of PHB concentration to cell concentration was
quantified from the chloroform phase by gravimetric method (Hahn et al.
1995). The residual biomass or
non-PHB content was determined as the difference between the cell concentration
and PHB. The polymer samples were analyzed for its purity using Thermo-Nicolet
FT-IR spectrometer, Model 5700, (Madison WI). The spectra were recorded in the MID
IR range from 4,000 to 650 cm–1, using single bounce
attenuated total reflectance (ATR) accessory with zinc selenide crystal.
Sixty-four scans were averaged to get the spectra. The IR spectra were recorded
with 4 cm–1 resolution and analysis of the spectra was
carried out using OMNIC software.

Results and discussion
Identification of a suitable media for PHB production
The yields of biomass and PHB as well as the percentage of sporulation in
three different media are shown in Fig. 1.
B. mycoides DFC1 showed less growth and PHB
production in Basal mineral salt medium (BMSLM). The endospore staining revealed
>60 % sporulation under nutrient-limited conditions when compared with the
other two media. Chen et al. (1991)
earlier reported on the degradation of the PHB polymer due to sporulation while
Fujita et al. (2005) discussed on the
regulation of the gene SpoOA responsible for sporulation during nutrient
limitation. The present data also corroborated the interference of PHB production
by sporulation in B. mycoides DFC1 due to
nutrient limitation in BMSLM. Further, the PHB production in GPB medium (1.83 g/l)
was equally effective as nutrient broth medium with 1.0 % glucose (NBG medium) of
Tajima et al. (2003), (1.62 g/l),
indicating that a high PHB accumulation (57.2 %w/w) in the isolated strain,
B. mycoides DFC1 could be achieved with these
media ingredients.Fig. 1 Comparison of cell growth, sporulation and PHB production by
B. mycoides DFC1 in different
media



Determination of initial glucose concentration
The concentration of the glucose in the culture medium determines the cell
growth and PHB production. The results for the initial glucose concentration of
the GPB medium supporting maximum PHB production is shown in Fig. 2. It is evident that both cell growth and PHB
content improved as the initial concentration of glucose was increased from 5.0 to
20.0 g/l. Maximum cell growth and glucose utilization occurred up to 15.0 g/l, as
a result the medium became acidic (pH 5.2). Fluorescence microscopic study after
every 12 h revealed that the low pH of the medium did not affect the PHB
accumulation and resulted in 65.22 %w/w of dry cell weight at the end of
72 h.Fig. 2 Effect of initial glucose concentration on PHB production in GPB
media



Effect of G/P ratio and initial pH
In the present study the G/P ratio was identified to affect the growth-associated
PHB production as well as sporulation to a certain extent in B. mycoides DFC1. Table 1 show that the 3:1 G/P ratio supported maximum
biomass and PHB content. Studies on the use of protein hydrolysates and other
organic nitrogen sources to support good biomass and PHB content has been reported
for bacteria such as R. eutropha, Azotobacter beijerinckii and recombinant E. coli (Lee and Chang 1994; Bormann et al. 1998a, b). The
extremes of G/P ratio, i.e. the presence of excess peptone or glucose does not
favor for a high PHB content. The use of C/N ratio as an important parameter in
fermentation process to achieve high cell density and product formation was
documented by Grothe et al. (1999).
Similarly, a high C/N ratio favoring maximum PHB accumulation in Alcaligenes eutrophus has been reported by Park et al.
(1997).Table 1 Effect of G/P ratio on PHB production

The spores were not detected in the production media until 72 h with <80
spores/ml present at the end of 120 h. The reason for such delayed sporulation
could be due to the presence of peptone as the complex nutrient which probably
regulates the flux of metabolic intermediates towards PHB biosynthesis favoring
growth-associated PHB production in B.
mycoides. Earlier studies also documented on the stimulation of spore
formation in response to stringent conditions (De Vries et al. 2004).

The effect of initial pH was investigated for the 3:1 G/P ratio and the results are
shown in Table 2. Although cell growth and
PHB production was observed from pH 5.7 onwards, the PHB content (11.3 ± 0.5 %w/w)
was low at the end of 48 h. The maximum PHB accumulation (65.5 ± 1.5 %w/w) was
observed at pH 7.3 with minimum sporulation and remained stable without undergoing
degradation. Bacillus sp. strains are known to
produce several metabolic intermediates such as acetate, lactate and acetoin
during growth and the accumulated PHB is used as energy source at the time of
sporulation (Benoit et al. 1990). In
the present study, the PHB remained stable probably due to some factors
suppressing the intermediates of sporulation, further confirming importance of
this process parameter in the production medium.Table 2 Effect of initial pH on PHB production and

Characterization of PHB
The FT-IR spectroscopy of the extracted polymer showed an intense band at
1,720 cm–1 corresponding to the ester-carbonyl (C=O)
stretching vibration (data not shown) characteristic for the short chain length
monomers of PHB (Hong et al. 1999).

Statistical optimization of PHB production
Based on the results of the preliminary experiments, CCRD was used to
determine the optimized culture conditions to maximize cell growth and PHB
production using GPB media. The experimental design matrix is presented in
Table 3 and the data obtained were used
to develop models through the second-order polynomial model equation
(Eqs. 2, 3) which allows all the linear and quadratic components of the
main effects and the linear-by-linear interactions to be estimated.Table 3 Experimental design matrix in terms of actual, coded factors and

The analysis of variance (Tables 4,
5) indicated that B, AB, A2, B2 and C2 as significant terms (p < 0.05) for cell growth and PHB content. The sign
and magnitude of the coefficients indicated the effect of the variables on the
responses. At quadratic level glucose (A) and
pH (C) were found to have significant
(p < 0.05) negative effect on both cell
growth and PHB content and therefore can act as limiting factor at high
concentrations leading to sporulation. Glucose and peptone (B) showed significant (p < 0.05) positive interactive effect for both cell growth and
PHB content. In Fig. 3a–d are shown the
surface plots for the interactive factors glucose, peptone and pH. The 2D contour
and the 3D response surface plots are generally the graphical representation of
the regression equation and the interaction between the variables can be inferred
from the shapes of the surface plots (Yu et al. 2008). The maximum predicted cell dry weight (4.45 g/l) and PHB
content (75.92 %w/w) increased with increase in the concentration of peptone.
Further, the interaction between glucose and pH was negligible and observed as
circular plots (Fig. 3e, f) when peptone
concentration was kept constant at 5.0 g/l. The results indicate that the
responses varied much as function of concentration of peptone and it is essential
to maintain a proper G/P ratio in growth-associated PHB-producing bacteria to achieve
maximum PHB production. Similar studies on the importance of the presence of
complex organic nutrients favoring PHB production has been reported for some
bacteria such as Azotobacter vinelandii (Page
et al. 1992) and recombinant
E. coli (Song et al. 1999).Table 4 Analysis of regression coefficients and their significance for

(%w/w); interactive effect shown as a function of peptone versus pH for
c cell dry weight and d PHB content. e–f Interactive effect
shown as a function of glucose versus pH for the responses e cell dry weight and f PHB content



The significance and adequacy of the model was assessed using F test and determination coefficient (R2) of the analysis of
variance (ANOVA). The model F value for the
responses cell dry weight and PHB content were high, i.e., 39.57 and 36.80,
respectively. A high model F value indicates
the model as significant and the factors could explain adequately the variation in
the data around its mean. The goodness of fit of the model determined by
correlation coefficient was also high (R2 = 0.97) for both the responses, since
R2 >0.75
indicates aptness of the model. The adequate precision value which measures the
signal-to-noise ratio is 16.135 and 16.445 for cell growth and PHB content. A
value of >4 is considered desirable and indicate that the model could navigate
the design space which is further corroborated by the insignificant lack of fit
values (Tables 4, 5).

Model validation and PHB production
The recommended solution obtained for the constraint to ‘maximize’ cell dry
weight and PHB content was glucose 17.34 g/l, peptone 7.03 g/l and pH 7.3. With
the optimized solution, experiments were carried out in duplicates to evaluate the
accuracy of the predicted model using the modified GPB medium. The percentages of
relative deviation for the validated responses calculated for the predicted and
observed response are shown in Table 6.
Further the time course fermentation study (Fig. 4) revealed that the PHB content (76.32 %w/w) showed a 1.82-fold
increase (1.82–3.32 g/l) after optimization using response surface methodology in
comparison to the media used in the preliminary studies. The endospore staining
and fluorescence microscopic studies of bacterial cells revealed negligible (~40
spores/ml) spore count for the optimized media at the end of 72 h which further
substantiate the efficiency of the GPB media for PHB production. The yield
obtained is comparatively higher when compared with other Bacillus sp. strains like Bacillus
sp INT005 (35.30 %) (Tajima et al. 2003), Bacillus cereus SPV
(38.0 %) (Valappil et al. 2007),
Bacillus cereus CFR06 (46.0 %) (Halami
2008) reported so far. Although
Bacillus sp. are considered as industrial
workhorses for the production of various enzymes, antibiotics and host for
recombinant DNA technology after E. coli, the
studies on industrial scale PHB production has not drawn much attention due to the
limitations of PHB as energy source for sporulation process (Singh et al.
2009; Jendrossek 2009). The present study identified a production
medium with minimum ingredients for PHB biosynthesis by B.
mycoides DFC1, which resisted sporulation for longer hours (72 h) as
well as accumulated PHB to the maximum extent of ~76.0 % of its dry cell weight
when compared to earlier reports.Table 6 Constraints, criteria for optimization, solution along with

Conclusion
In the present investigation, the conditions favoring maximum PHB production
over sporulation was evaluated using a modified glucose–peptone medium by
one-factor-at-a-time approach. The application of statistical optimization helped to
determine collectively the optimum process conditions responsible for PHB
production. The study also revealed that selected process parameters supported
maximum PHB accumulation and also reduced the problem of sporulation. Further
scale-up studies using the optimized media by B.
mycoides DFC1 is under progress.
