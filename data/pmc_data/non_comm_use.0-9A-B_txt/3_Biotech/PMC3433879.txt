tool for genetic analysis. Our objective was to identify microsatellite markers that
could be used to differentiate between male and female date palm (Phoenix dactylifera). The date palm is a dioecious plant
whose sex cannot be determined until it reaches a reproductive age between 5 and
10 years. An early selection and/or differentiation of young seedlings into males
and females could enhance breeding and assist research programs for genetic
improvements of the date palm. Here, we report on the use of microsatellites for
determining the sex of immature date palm. Using 14 microsatellite primer pairs with
129 date palm leaves and tissue culture samples from 34 cultivars which represent
the major date palm diversity of Qatar, 254 microsatellite loci were detected, of
these, 22 microsatellite loci could be used to identify 9 out of 12 male date palm
samples (75%). The data also indicated that the heterozygous allele with the size
160/190 produced by the primer mPdCIR048 reoccurred 4 times exclusively in the 12
individual male samples but not in any of the 117 female date palm samples tested,
and hence it is a promising candidate marker to detect male sex in date palm.
Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of 12 male samples with 7 female Khasab
cultivars produced 2 autonomous groups of males and females and similar results were
observed with 13 female Shishi cultivars. Our results suggest that the SSR markers
described here have potential in sex identification of date palm.

Introduction
Palms (Arecaceae) are a particularly
interesting family for the study of dicliny (separate male and female trees), as
they display great diversity in their reproductive morphology, with more than 85% of
the palm genera having single sex flowers (Dransfield et al. 2008). Historically, breeding programs to maintain
genetic diversity have not been employed because there is no easy and accurate way
to distinguish between male and female plants prior to first flowering, which occurs
between 5 and 8 years after planting (Aberlenc-Bertossi et al. 2011; Bendiab et al. 1993). Date palm progenies consist of male and female individuals
in equal proportions, which has led to the hypothesis that sex is determined
genetically (Daher et al. 2010). Based
on cytological studies with chromomycin staining, Siljak-Yakovlev et al.
(1996) proposed the existence of sex
chromosomes in the date palm. However, neither the gene associated with sex
determination has been reported to date nor has the process of developmental arrest
in sterile sex organs been studied in detail. Siljak-Yakovlev et al. (1996) also illustrate two other important points
in understanding sex determination in dioecious species of plants. First, there are
often no obvious cytological or genetic differences between male and female plants,
and, second, it is often difficult to study the genetic or molecular basis of sex
determination in many species of monoecious or dioecious, agronomically important
plants simply because of their longevity.

A severe fusarium wilt of date palm, Fusarium
oxysporum, recently destroyed date palms throughout Africa. The problem
was exacerbated by the lack of natural genetic diversity in date palm populations,
which may be overcome by introducing genetic variability into populations
(especially for traits which confer disease resistance). The ability to type the sex
of seedlings would speed this otherwise lengthy process (Juarez and Banks
1998).

In recent years, there have been serious efforts to understand the basis of sex
determination in date palm and to develop methods of identifying the gender at an
early stage using isozymes (Torres and Tisserat 1980), peroxydases (Majourhat et al. 2002), and molecular marker tools using random amplified
polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Moghaieb et al. 2010).

In this paper, we have attempted to identify sex-specific DNA markers for date
palm cultivars using a microsatellite molecular technique. Such a technique would
not only facilitate the identification and selection of good male pollinators for
use in breeding programs but could also be used to select date palm with
characteristics of high fruit yield, and an improved physical and chemical
characteristic of the fruits.

Materials and methods
Plant material
Leaves and tissue culture samples from 117 female and 12 male date palms,
comprising 34 cultivars, were collected from different locations in Qatar
(Table 1). These cultivars represent the
diversity of date palm genotypes in the Qatari date palm plantation. Young leaves
from mature trees, randomly sampled, were collected and stored at −80 °C until DNA
extraction.Table 1 Cultivars and tissue culture samples of date palm (Phoenix dactylifer) from Qatar used in this

A total of 129 date palm samples representing 34 cultivars were
collected



DNA extraction
The frozen young leaf tissues were cleaned carefully with distilled water to
remove the waxy layer and then 1 g of each leaf sample was cut into small pieces
and grounded using liquid nitrogen into a fine powder. The DNA was extracted using
the DNeasy Plant Maxi kit protocol (QIAGEN), following the manufacturer’s
instructions outlined in the DNeasy Plant Handbook. The DNA samples obtained were
quantified using NanoDrop® ND 1000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the quality was determined by electrophoresis of
DNA samples (2 μL) loaded on 0.85% agarose gels and separated at 100 V for 30 min,
following which the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and viewed under UV
transilluminator.

Microsatellite amplification
Fourteen labeled primer pairs as described by Billotte et al. (2004) were synthesized by Applied Biosystems
(Belgium, Life Technologies Europe BV) and are presented in Table 2. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
using 25 μL of a reaction mixture containing 2 μL (5 ng) of total genomic DNA,
12.5 μL of AmpliTaq Gold® 360 Mastermix (Applied
Biosystems), 1 μL (5 pmol/μL) of forward primer (labeled), and 1 μL of reverse
primer in addition to 8.5 μL of nuclease free water. Amplification was carried out
in a Veriti 96 Well Fast Thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) under the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 35 cycles (denaturation at
95 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature depending on primer for 30 s, and extension
at 72 °C for 1 min), and final extension at 72 °C for 7 min.Table 2 Forward and reverse microsatellite primers and their Tm used in this study

SSR fragment analysis
Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were screened on a 3130 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) by running 1 μL of PCR product mixed with 10 μL Hi-Di
formamide and 0.3 μL GS500LIZ followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min. The
sample was then kept on ice for genotyping in a 3130 Genetic Analyzer. Automatic
genotyping and allele scoring were performed by the
GeneMapper® software v4.0 (Applied
Biosystems).

Data analysis
The data were analyzed with PowerMarker software v3.0 (Liu and Muse
2005) to determine the percentage
of heterozygosity, major allele frequency, number of alleles, gene diversity, and
polymorphic information content (PIC).

The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of the male date palm with Shishi and
Khasab cultivars was analyzed and drawn using PAST software v1.91 (Hammer et al.
2001) based on the Hamming distance
measures by convex hulls.

Results and discussion
The microsatellites examined were highly polymorphic, possessing a great number
of alleles. A total of 124 alleles with a mean of 8.86 alleles per locus were
scored, however, the number of alleles varied from 3 using primer mPdCIR090 to 13
using primers mPdCIR010 and mPdCIR078 (Table 3). The number of alleles per locus detected in this study was
higher than those scored by Zehdi et al. (2004) who recognized 7.14 alleles per locus when examining 46
Tunisian date palm accessions using 14 microsatellite loci. On the other hand,
Elshibli and Korpelainen (2007)
identified 21.4 alleles per locus, which is more than the number of alleles per
locus detected in this study. This may be a result of using a greater number of
microsatellite loci (16) in addition to using different genotypes—68 Sudan and
Morocco date palm accessions.Table 3 Genetic diversity information by locus

The 14 primers used in this study successfully produced clear amplified SSR
bands with sizes ranging from 118 bp with primer mPdCIR078 to 302 bp with primers
mPdCIR044 and mPdCIR032 (Table 3), similar
to the results of Ahmed and Al-Qaradawi (2009) where the band sizes ranged from 100 to 300 bp.

Interestingly, the 14 microsatellite primers used with the 117 female and 12
male date palm samples used in this study formed 254 microsatellite loci with a mean
of 10.4 per primer (Table 3). The highest
was 36 different microsatellite loci scored with primer mPdCIR015, but only 3
different microsatellite loci were scored with primer mPdCIR090.

In a number of agriculturally important plants, such as kiwi fruit, date palm,
hops, papaya, and pistachio, the females produce the commercial harvest, while in
some others, such as asparagus, males provide the better quality produce.
Identification of the sex of such plants at their early stage of growth can be of
great economic potential. Moreover, studies on marker technology regarding dioecy in
general would provide a better understanding of the developmental (Ainsworth et al.
1998) as well as evolution pathways of
dimorphism (Charlesworth and Charlesworth 1978; Charlesworth 1996).

Three primers (mPdCIR035, mPdCIR044, and mPdCIR090) could not distinguish
between male and female samples (Table 4)
whereas the remaining 11 microsatellite primers identified 22 loci, in only the male
date palm samples. Using these loci, 9 of 12 (75%) male plants tested were
recognized. Moreover, 82% of those loci were heterozygous alleles
(Table 4), which is in agreement with the
finding of Al-Dous et al. (2011) who
scanned 3.5 million SNP genotypes in the male and female genomes of date palm to
identify polymorphisms that segregate with gender. They observed that all male
genomes shared mainly the same heterozygous genotypes, whereas female genomes shared
mainly the same homozygous genotypes, while primer mPdCIR010 detected only one
heterozygous allele even as the remaining three alleles were homozygous
(Table 4). Sexually antagonistic
polymorphisms are polymorphisms in which the allele is advantageous to one sex but
is deleterious to the other sex. In an influential paper, Rice (1984) hypothesized that such polymorphisms should
be relatively common on the X chromosome (or on the W in female-heterogametic
species) but relatively rare on the autosomes. Yet, Fry (2010) showed that there are plausible assumptions
under which the reverse is expected to be true, and pointed out studies that gave
evidence for sexually antagonistic variation on the autosomes. Although more work is
needed to resolve the issue, it is premature to conclude that the X chromosome is a
“hot spot” for the accumulation of sexually antagonistic variation.Table 4 Twenty two loci hetero and homozygous allele (base pairs) markers

Primers with code mPdCIR035, mPdCIR044, and mPdCIR090 could not
differentiate male and female date palm samples due to no amplification of
distinguished markers in male plants therefore have been excluded from the
table. For males 3, 7, and 9, no distinguished loci were detected and hence
these samples have been excluded from the table



For male 12, 6 markers were detected while just one specific marker was detected
for male 1. However, for males 3, 7, and 9, no markers were detected
(Table 4).

Male associated DNA fragments have previously been identified by random
amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) in many dioecious plants. Sakamoto et al.
(1995) cloned a 730 bp long DNA
fragment named MADCl (male associated DNA sequence) in Cannabis sativa. However, MADC1 does not include a long ORF and is not
likely to correspond to a transcribed gene (Sakamoto et al. 1995). Using representational difference analysis,
several male sex-specific restriction fragments in Silene
latifolia have been isolated and cloned. These male-specific
restriction fragments were found to be homologous to other sequences shared between
male and female plants (Domison et al. 1996).

The mean of the gene diversity was 0.70 (Table 3), ranging from 0.51 for loci mPdCIR057 and mPdCIR093 to high
diversity 0.88 for locus mPdCIR015, indicating that the Qatari date palm collection
is characterized by a high degree of genetic diversity. This level of gene diversity
is similar to 0.70 reported for the Tunisian date palm germplasm (Zehdi et al.
2004) and less than 0.853 reported
for the Sudanese date palm (Elshibli and Korpelainen 2007). This high level of diversity is expected because of the
unique mechanism responsible for generating SSR allelic diversity by replication
slippage. Replication slippage is thought to occur more frequently than single
nucleotide mutations and insertion/deletion events, which generate the polymorphisms
detected by RAPD analysis (Powell et al. 1996).

The heterozygous allele sized 160/190 exhibited by primer mPdCIR048
(Table 4) seems to be a distinguishing
marker for sex in date palm because it appeared 4 times in the 12 individual male
date palm trees tested. At the same time, no sign of this marker was detected in 117
individual female date palm trees. The two following alleles sized 122/140
(exhibited by the primer mPdCIR078) and 163/175 (exhibited by the primer mPdCIR093),
respectively, were repeated twice in the 12 individual male date palm tree tested.
Again, there was no sign of these alleles in the 117 individual female date palm
trees.

The data obtained from the 14 primers combinations enabled the samples of the
two date palm cultivars Shishi and Khasab to be classified into the two groups
according to their sex expression compared with male trees using principal
coordinate analysis (PCoA) (Gower 1966)
using the PAST software v1.91 (Hammer et al. 2001). The Hamming distance was chosen in preference to other
distance measures, as it does not class a common absence of an allele as a shared
characteristic. It was, therefore, judged to be most appropriate for the present
study, which included highly polymorphic microsatellite data spanning two ploidy
levels.

PCoA suggests two broad groups—one includes 7 female Khasab trees
(Fig. 1) while the other is made up of 12
male date palm trees which are autonomous with 21% of the variation explained by the
first axis and 17% by the second axis. The same two groups separate 13 female Shishi
trees from the 12 male date palm trees (Fig. 2). There is a limited overlap between the two groups. Twenty
percent of the variation is explained by the first axis while 13% of the variation
is explained by the second axis.Fig. 1 Scatter plot of the first and second principal coordinate analysis

Farmers are currently faced with distinguishing between cultivars propagated by
seeds. The use of vegetative and flowering characteristics (Rhouma 1994) or the isozyme markers (Mohamed Ould et al.
2001) are less rewarding, since these
traits take a long time—between 5 and 7 years—to become visible. Fortunately, the
SSR alleles revealed were successfully used to molecularly discriminate between a
nearly unlimited number of date palm cultivars. Compared to other reported date palm
studies, the outcome in this study is more accurate than that observed using
isoenzymes (Booij et al. 1995; Mohamed
Ould et al. 2001) and plastid DNA
haplotypes (Sakka 2003). Our data
provide evidence that these powerful markers can be used as key identifiers of the
sex in date palm materials.
