In the online published article, the Bacillus subtilis subsp. stecoris name was wrongly published and it should be corrected to Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris throughout the manuscript.

Description of Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris subsp. nov

Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris [ster’co.ris. L. gen. n. stercoris, of compost, from which the strain was isolated]. Grows optimally at 45 °C (range 24–50), pH of 7 (range 5–9), and grew in the presence of 7% NaCl. Facultative anaerobe by fermentation, forms white irregular colonies 1–2 mm in diameter when grown on dTSA, cells are straight rods 4–5 µm length by 1 µm width, and stain Gram positive. Degrades potato starch by amylase activity and expresses partial β-xylanase activity detected when grown on dTSA with x-β-D-xyloside. Type strain is D7XPN1T (=KCTC 33554T, JCM 30051T).
