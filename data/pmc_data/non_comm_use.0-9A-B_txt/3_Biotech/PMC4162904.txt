Introduction
Genus Bacillus is a Gram-positive,
spore-forming, fermentative, aerobic and rodshaped bacteria. Several species of this
group are non-pathogenic, simple to cultivate and secrete enzymes such as proteases,
amylases and cellulases that are useful for a number of industrial applications
(Arbige et al. 1993). The Bacillus subtilis group contains the closely related taxa
Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis (Smith et al. 1964; Nakamura et al. 1999), Bacillus licheniformis
(Skerman et al. 1980), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Priest et al. 1987), Bacillus atrophaeus
(Nakamura 1989), Bacillus mojavensis (Roberts et al. 1994), Bacillus
vallismortis (Roberts et al. 1996), Bacillus subtilis subsp.
spizizenii (Nakamura et al. 1999). Classical identification methods based on
biochemical tests or fatty acid methyl ester profiling were laborious and hence not
applicable for the purpose of a rapid screening. These taxa can be differentiated
from one another by fatty acid composition analysis, restriction digest analysis and
DNA–DNA hybridization analysis, but are quite difficult to differentiate by
phenotypic characteristics (Roberts et al. 1994; Nakamura et al. 1999). The use of the 16S rRNA sequence as a target for genetic
detection was therefore considered. Numerous Bacillus species described so far have been found to display rather
conserved 16S rRNA sequences compared to other genera. Thus the use of this
taxonomic marker is sometimes inadequate for species definition according to
generally accepted criteria (Stackebrandt and Goebel 1994). Such unusual similarities exist for members of the
‘Bacillus 16S rRNA groupI’, including B. subtilis, which displays 99.3 % similarity at the 16S
rRNA level to B. atrophaeus and 98.3 % to
B. licheniformis and B.
amyloliquefaciens (Ash et al. 1991). In the present study, it has been shown that specific
primers for detection of endoglucanase gene could be used for identification of
B. subtilis.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
A total 35 Bacillus strains were used in
this study (Table 1). Of 12 B. subtilis, ten strains were isolates from pond
sediments. For Bacillus cereus, one ATCC strain
and nine pond sediment isolates were tested. Five pond isolates that had been
classified as Bacillus pumilus and two as
B. amyloliquefaciens were also included in
the test. For Bacillus megaterium,B. licheniformis and Bacillus
thuringiensis, ATCC strains were analysed. All the pond sediment
isolates were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing and available in our
laboratory.Table 1 Bacterial strains used

Soil samples
24 Soil samples collected from agriculture field and fish culture ponds were
also included.

Primers
The endoglucanase gene sequences (EC, 3.2.1.4) of B.
subtilis were retrieved from GenBank nucleotide database and were
aligned using Clustal W (1.82) Multiple Alignment Program. Two sets of primers
EN1F (103–124 bp) 5′-CCAGTAGCCAAGAATGGCCAGC-3′, EN1R (1,413–1,393 bp)
5′-GGAATAATCGCCGCTTTGTGC-3′) were designed by analyzing the conserved regions of
the aligned sequences.

DNA isolation
The total genomic DNA was extracted from bacterial suspension (after 12 h
incubation in LB) using DNA extraction kit (Merck Bioscience, India) following the
manufacture’s instruction. Soil genomic DNA was extracted by using ultra clean
soil DNA isolation kits (MoBio, USA).

Polymerase chain reaction
The PCR reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained, dNTPs each 100 μmol; 1X PCR
buffer (10 mM Tris Cl, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.01 %
gelatin); each primer 10 pmol; Taq DNA
polymerase (NEB) 0.75U and bacterial DNA 100 ng. The touch down PCR in a volume of
50 μl was carried out with initial denaturation of 94 °C for 5 min followed by ten
cycles of touch down program (94 °C for 30 s, 70 °C for 20 s and 74 °C for 45 s,
followed by a 1 °C decrease of the annealing temperature every cycle). After
completion of the touch down program, 25 cycles were subsequently performed (94 °C
for 30 s, 60 °C for 20 s and 74 °C for 45 s) and ending with a 10 min extension at
74 °C. PCR reactions were run on a 1.5 % agarose gel in 1X TBE.

Cloning and sequencing
Band was excised from the gel and PCR product was purified by using the
QIAquick gel purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(QIAGEN, Germany). The purified PCR product was cloned in
pGEM®-T Easy vector following manufacturer’s protocol
(promega) and transformed into DH5α cells. Sequencing of the positive clones were
done by Sanger method using 96 capillary high through put sequencer; ABI 3,730 XL
(Xcelris, India) with T7 and SP6 universal primer.

Results and discussion
BlastN seach of endoglucanase gene of B.
subtilis (accession numbers HM470252.1, AF355629.1 and CP002906.1)
revealed 93 % similarity with B. amyloliquefaciens, B.
megaterium, B. pumilus and B.
licheniformis 90 % with B. subtilis
subsp. spizizenii and 98–99 % with Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Paenibacillus campinasensis. Based on multiple alignments
of endo-β-1,4-glucanase genes, a specific consensus motif was identified in the
endoglucanase gene of B. subtilis, G.
stearothermophilus and P.
campinasensis. Two PCR primers, EN1F and EN1R, were chosen that were
predicted to specifically amplify a 1,311 bpDNA fragment of the B. Subtilis, G. stearothermophilus and P. campinasensis. The Genbank database (NCBI) search for
complimentary sequences revealed 100 % homology between the primers and the gene
encodes endo-β-1,4-glucanase of B. subtilis as
well as G. stearothermophilus and P. campinasensis. No homologous sequences were found for
other members of genus Bacillus indicating an
excellent specificity of the primers for B.
subtilis.

As expected, the test turned out to be positive only for B. subtilis among the different species of Genus Bacillus PCR amplification with genomic DNA isolated from
in vitro cultured B. subtilis resulted in a
reproducible amplification of 1,311 bp product with primer combinations EN1F/EN1R.
To determine the sensitivity of PCR, endpoint titration with serial dilutions of
genomic DNA isolated from the standard strain of B.
subtilis was carried out and positive results obtained as little as
500 ficogram of DNA (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Limit of detection of endoglucanase gene in different

To assess the range of specificity of the PCR test, a number of endoglucanase
positive Bacillus species were assayed. Given the
considerable number of species established to date under B.
subtilis group, our choice to assess the range of specificity was
restricted to B. subtilis subsp. subtilis that was representative of the B. subtilis group.

To test the specificity of the amplified products, control experiments were
performed under the same conditions with DNA from different members of B. subtilis group as well as B.
cereus group. The test found to be positive only for B. Subtilis (Fig. 2). It is noteworthy that the species detected as positive with
this test are very close from a taxonomic point of view when phylogenetic tree was
constructed on the basis of endoglucanase gene sequences of different species of
Genus Bacillus (Fig. 3). Attempt to detect B.
subtilis directly from soil samples collected from agriculture field
and fish culture ponds were successful, out of 24 soil samples collected from fish
pond and agricultural field ten samples were positive for amplification. Cloning and
sequencing confirmed the amplicon to be endoglucanase gene of B. subtilis. However, after enrichment of negative soil
samples on TSB 20 % increased positivity rate was obtained by PCR, demonstrating
that the initial concentration of B. subtilis was
at a proportion below the detection limit. The primers not only differentiated
B. subtilis from other species but also
differentiated at subspecies level as expected product size could not be predicted
from B. subtilis subsp. spizizenii by primer blast (NCBI).Fig. 2 PCR amplification for endoglucanase gene in different Bacillus spp. Lane

In this report, a PCR method has been established for identification of
B. subtilis. Endo-β-1,4-glucanase gene has been
chosen to design primers that could be useful for identification and direct
detection of B. subtilis from environmental
samples. Detection of B. subtilis has been shown
to be specific, although the primers showed specificity for G. stearothermophilus and P.
campinasensis in primer blast, and predicted amplicon to be 1,311 bp.
However, B. subtilis could be differentiated from
G. stearothermophilus and P. campinasensis by sequencing of the pcr product. 16S
rRNA gene sequence analysis is the most commonly used method for identifying
bacteria or for constructing bacterial phylogenetic relationships (Woese
1987; Vandamme et al. 1996; Joung and Cote 2002); however, its usefulness is limited because of the high
percentage of sequence similarity between closely related species (Ash et al.
1991; Marti’nez-Murcia et al.
1992; Christensen et al. 1998). The use of protein-encoding genes as
phylogenetic markers is now a common approach (Yamamoto and Harayama 1998; Ko et al. 2004; Chelo et al. 2007). Detailed investigations have demonstrated that sequences from
protein-encoding genes can accurately predict genome relatedness and may replace
DNA–DNA hybridization for species identification and delineation in the future
(Stackebrandt et al. 2002; Zeigler
2003). Wang et al. (2007) clearly showed that in the B. subtilis group, within which species differentiation
is very difficult, core genes such as gyrB allow differentiation on genetic basis.
Compared to other genera, Bacillus species are
having conserved 16s rRNA sequences and are difficult to identify at species level
using this marker (Stackebrandt and Goebel 1994).

Conclusion
In the present study, the demonstrated specificity of the oligonucleotides used
as PCR primers and results of experiments with soil samples provide the basis to
develop a diagnostic assay for identification and detection B. subtilis form environment samples. As the primers used in this
study have been found to be specific to endoglucanase gene of G. stearothermophilus and P.
campinasensis, we suggest to use these primers as supplementary PCR
assay to 16s rRNA sequencing for identification of B.
subtilis.
