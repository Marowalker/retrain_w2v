supplemented cultivation media. Both dried orange peel and sweet lime peel could
induce the production of this enzyme. The working strain showed a pronounced optimum
pH and temperature for β-xylosidase production at 6.0 and 27 °C, respectively. The
enzyme production was found to remain stable for a long period of 120 h. Orange peel
and sweet lime peel showed different responses in the presence of various nitrogen
sources, probably due to their differences in hemicellulosic contents. This could be
further confirmed by the difference in enzyme production after pretreatment with
acid and alkali.

Introduction
Interest in the enzymology of hemicellulose degradation has become recently
reinitiated because of the biotechnological interest in the hydrolysis of
hemicelluloses for the pulp and paper or the feedstock industry (Buchert et al.
1992). The breakdown of hemicellulose
is accomplished by the synergistic action of xylanase (1, 4-β-d-xylan xylanohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.8) and β-xylosidase
(β-d-xyloside xylohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.37)
(Biswas et al. 1988), of which the later
hydrolyzes short xylo oligosaccharides and xylobiose from the non-reducing end to
release xylose (Shallom et al. 2005).

In food industry, it is employed in juice extraction and liberation of aroma
from grapes during wine making (Manzanares et al. 1999), and along with endoxylanase it is used for processing of
food and in biofuel production. Pure xylan, being an expensive substrate cannot be
used for cost efficient bulk production of β-xylosidase at industrial level. To
bring down the production cost, β-xylosidase should ideally be produced from simple
and inexpensive substrates which include lignocellulosic sources.

Among the natural anthropogenic sources, food industry wastes consisting of
fruit peels contain high amount of underutilized xylan. This huge amount of
lignocellulose often creates a serious waste disposal problem. Various microbial
transformations have been proposed for the utilization of this food processing waste
for producing valuable products such as biogas, ethanol, citric acid, chemicals,
various enzymes, volatile flavoring compounds, fatty acids and microbial
biomass.

The advantage of using micro-organisms for the production of enzymes is that
these are not influenced by climatic and seasonal factors, and can be subjected to
genetic and environmental manipulations to increase the yield (Bhardwaj and Garg
2010). A number of fungal strains
namely, Aspergillus awamori (Smith and Wood
1991; Kurakake et al. 2005), Aspergillus
brasiliensis and Aspergillus niger
(Pedersen et al. 2007), Aspergillus japonicas (Semenova et al. 2009), Aspergillus
ochraceus (Michelin et al. 2012a), Aspergillus terricola (Michelin et al. 2012b), Acremonium
cellulolyticus (Kanna et al. 2011), Cryptococcus podzolicus
(Shubakov 2000), Fusarium proliferatum (Saha 2001a), Humicola grisea
var. thermoidea (Lembo et al. 2006), Kluyveromyces marxianus
(Rajoka 2007), Penicillium janthinellum (Curotto et al. 1994), Penicillium janczewskii
(Terrasan et al. 2010), Talaromyces thermophilus (Guerfali et al. 2008), Trichoderma
harzianum (Ximenes et al. 1996), and Trichoderma reesei
(Semenova et al. 2009), were
investigated, and in some cases cheap substrates like wheat bran (Biswas et al.
1988) and corn cob (Michelin et al.
2012a, b) were utilized, but no such report was available on fungal
β-xylosidase production utilizing citrus fruit wastes obtained from food processing
industries.

Therefore in the present study, the production of an intracellular β-xylosidase
in citrus fruit waste supplemented medium was reported from a high-yielding strain
of Penicillium janthinellum and the effect of the
cultural conditions were investigated.

Materials and methods
Microorganism and culture conditions
The working strain, Penicillium
janthinellum MTCC 10889, a potent endoxylanase producer (Kundu and
Ray 2011), was cultivated in a basal
medium (BM) containing (g/l): peptone, 0.9;
(NH4)2HPO4,
0.4; KCl, 0.1; MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1 and
oat spelt xylan (Hi-Media Pvt. Ltd, India) 0.5 % (pH 6) at 27 °C.

Preparation of citrate substrates for enzyme production
Citrate fruit wastes namely orange peels and sweet lime peels were collected
from local market effluents, which were oven dried and were pulverized to 10-mesh
particle size before using in culture medium in place of pure xylan.

Enzyme extraction
The harvested mycelium was washed twice with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 4) and
mechanically disrupted in a Sonicator (Rivotek, India), and the cell mass was
extracted with 20 ml phosphate buffer (pH 4). The supernatant obtained after
removing the cell debris by centrifugation at 10,000g for 10 min was used as the enzyme source.

β-Xylosidase assay
The β-xylosidase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl β-d-xylopyranoside as substrate as described by Panbangred et al.
(1983). The assay mixture (500 μl)
containing equal volume of enzyme solution and 0.1 % substrate in 0.05 M citrate
buffer (pH 4.0), was incubated for 15 min at 55 °C. After incubation, the reaction
was stopped by 2 mL of 1 M Na2CO3
solution and the absorbance was read at 405 nm in a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu,
Japan). Citrate buffer diluted p-nitrophenol
was used as standard. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as amount of
enzyme producing 1 μmol of product (p-nitrophenol) per minute under the assay conditions.

Optimization of production parameters
Various physico-chemical process parameters required for β-xylosidase
production by Penicillium janthinellum were
determined by assaying the enzyme one at a time in the presence of varied range of
substrate concentrations (0.5–3 % w/v), at different incubation temperature
(7–47 °C), pH (4.0–9.0), cultivation times (24–120 h) and in the presence of
different nitrogen sources (0.9 % w/v), different metal ions and surfactants
(0.1 %).

Pretreatment of the substrate
To make components of wastes more accessible, orange peels and sweet lime
peels were treated with different concentrations of acid and alkali (1, 0.5,
0.1 M) for 30 min followed by repeated washing with distilled water and subsequent
neutralization.

Each experiment was done in triplicate and their values were averaged.

Results and discussion
β-Xylosidase was found to be produced as an extracellular enzyme in a number of
fungal strains, namely Neocallimastix frontalis
(Hebraud and Fevre 1990)
(Neocallimastix sp. M2 (Comlekcioglu et al.
2011); Aspergillus awamori CMI 142717 (Smith and Wood 1991); Aspergillus
japonicus (Wakiyama et al. 2008); Penicillium janthinellum
(Curotto et al. 1994), Fusarium proliferatum (Saha 2001a), Fusarium
verticillioides (Saha 2001b) Trichoderma reesei RUT
C-30 (Herrmann et al. 1997), but in
the present strain, β-xylosidase was found to be strictly intracellular. Although
pure xylan was (oat spelt) proved to be a better source than the citrus wastes
(Fig. 1), the use of purified xylan
enhances the cost of enzyme production and is a major limitation of the economically
feasible bioconversion and utilization of lignocellulosic materials (Yin et al.
2006). Hence for subsequent
experiments, only the citrus wastes, without any market value, as such were
used.Fig. 1 Synthesis of extracellular and intracellular β-xylosidase by
Penicillium janthinellum at cultivation
temperature, 27 °C; pH, 6; subtrate concentration, 1 %; and cultivation
time: OP, 72 h; SLP, 96 h; PX, 96 h



Effect of substrate concentration on β-xylosidase production
Highest β-xylosidase (Fig. 2) could be
obtained from the culture, supplemented by orange peel (1.5 % w/v) and sweet lime
peel (1 % w/v). Further increase in substrate could not bring about any remarkable
increase in enzyme activity which might be due to some kind of nutrient over load.
Similar type of observation was reported by Flores et al. (1997) in lemon peel supplemented culture medium
of Streptomyces sp.Fig. 2 Effect of substrate concentration on intracellular β-xylosidase
synthesis by Penicillium janthinellum
at cultivation temperature, 27 °C; pH, 7; and cultivation time: OP, 72 h;
SLP, 96 h



Effect of pH on β-xylosidase production
In both orange peel and sweet lime peel supplemented media, maximum
β-xylosidase activity was observed at pH 6 (Fig. 3), a pH preference similar to that of Aspergillus ocraceus (Michelin et al. 2012a) and A. niger NRC 107
(Abdel Naby et al. 1992) and
Streptomyces sp. CH-M-1035 (Flores et al.
1997), whereas a lower pH was
preferred by Penicillium sclerotiorum (Knob and
Carmona 2009).Fig. 3 Effect of pH on intracellular β-xylosidase synthesis by
Penicillium janthinellum at
cultivation temperature, 27 °C; substrate concentration, 1 %; and
cultivation time: OP, 72 h; SLP, 96 h



Effect of cultivation temperature on β-xylosidase production
Maximum enzyme production by Penicillium
janthinellum was obtained at 27 °C (Fig. 4), above which enzyme production by the fungal cells was
decreased probably due to thermal inactivation of the enzymes involved in the
metabolic pathway (Aiba et al. 1973).
On the other hand, at lower temperature, the transport of substrate across the
cells was suppressed and lower yield of products were attained (Aiba et al.
1973). Almost similar temperature
was used for production of cell associated β-xylosidase in Penicillium sclerotiorum (Knob and Carmona 2009).Fig. 4 Effect of cultivation temperature on intracellular β-xylosidase
synthesis by Penicillium janthinellum
at pH, 7; substrate concentration, 1 %; and cultivation time: OP, 72 h;
SLP, 96 h



Effect of cultivation time on β-xylosidase production
β-Xylosidase production was highest at 72 h in orange peel supplemented medium
(Fig. 5), but took longer time, when
orange peel was replaced by sweet lime peel (96 h). This difference in production
time indicated the difference in the type of hemicellulosic residues present in
the substrate and their accessibility towards the fungus. However, longer time of
144 and 168 h were reported to be required by Penicillium
sclerotiorum (Knob and Carmona 2009), Aspergillus terricola
(30 total U) Aspergillus ochraceus (56 total U)
of β-xylosidase after 168 h ((Michelin et al. 2012b) and Penicillium
janthinellum produced 1.14 μmol/min of β-xylosidase after 120 h
(Curotto et al. 1994),
respectively.Fig. 5 Effect of cultivation time on intracellular β-xylosidase
synthesis by Penicillium janthinellum
at cultivation temperature, 27 °C; pH, 7; and substrate concentration,
1 %



Contrary to the β-xylosidase of Streptomyces sp. which was found to reach the highest peak at 24 h
but diminished rapidly due to some unknown reason (Flores et al. 1997), in the present strain, stable rate of
enzyme production was found to persist up to 120th hour which proved to be more
preferable for commercial production.

Effect of additives on β-xylosidase production
Effect of various additives like nitrogen sources, metal ions and surfactants
was tested on the enzyme production (Table 1), which indicated that amongst various nitrogen sources tested,
tryptone (%) enhanced the enzyme production only in medium with orange peel,
whereas the inorganic sources showed better result in sweet lime peel supplemented
medium. Metal ions could not bring about significant increase in enzyme
production, only noteworthy effect was found by Na+ in
orange peel supplemented medium. Heavy metal ions such as
Hg2+, Fe2+, and
Cu2+ severely affected β-xylosidase production
possibly due to the damage of active sites of the essential enzymes and eventual
poor growth of the fungus. Although addition of surfactant brought about a
remarkable increase in enzyme production in Aspergillus
niger NRC 107 (Abdel Naby et al. 1992), none of the surfactants but Triton X-100 could restore
enzyme production, a result that coincides with the observation of Ghosh and Kundu
(1980). This might be due to
multiple reasons such as conformational changes in the tertiary, secondary
structure of the protein (Kuhad et al. 1998) or due to the an adverse effect of the surfactant on cell
permeability.Table 1 Effect of various additives on intracellular β-xylosidase

Effect of pretreatment of lignocellulosic substrates
After delignification (which removed hemicelluloses) with different
concentrations of acid and alkali, it was observed that mild acid and alkali
(0.5 M HCl and 0.5 M NaOH) pretreated orange peel enhanced enzyme production, but
pretreatment failed to do so in sweet lime peel (Table 2). It might be due to the greater vulnerability of sweet lime
peel to acid and alkali attack, and consequent non-availability of hemicellulosic
molecules to the fungus as effective carbon source for enzyme production (Biswas
et al. 1988). However, selective
pretreatment of agroindustrial wastes could be a viable strategy in the production
of high levels of xylanolytic enzymes (Michelin et al. 2012b).Table 2 Effect of pretreated substrate on intracellular β-xylosidase

Conclusion
Leachates from citrus plants or from disposed citrus peels can cause serious
organic pollution problems due to the high BOD of these materials (Braddock and
Crandall 1981), and pose serious
environmental risk. These wastes if used as the sole carbon source in place of
expensive xylan (about 150,000–180,000 INR per kg) for the production of
β-xylosidase, an industrially important enzyme, would definitely add economy in
enzyme production. Moreover, the problem of waste disposal from food processing
industries could be solved successfully. Further, the persisting production of
enzyme production for 120 h and ability to synthesize enzyme exploiting the citrus
wastes would make the strain interesting from commercial point of view.
