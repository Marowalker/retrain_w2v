distillery spent wash (DSW) effluents in increasing the growth and yield of two
species of oyster mushroom, Pleurotus flabellatus
(PF 1832) and P. sajor-caju (PS 1610) on abundantly available agro-waste, bagasse, was
evaluated. Three different levels of treatments were applied for each effluent. The
effects of amendments on the result were observed in terms of yield, biological
efficiency (BE) and substrate dry-matter loss. BE was found to be the highest
(66.63 ± 1.0 %) for P. sajor-caju grown on bagasse amended with 10 % DWW and lowest
for Pleurotus controls. While P. sajor-caju
performed better on bagasse amended with DWW, P.
flabellatus was more suited to grow on DSW amended bagasse. Degradation
of complex molecules was in accordance with substrate dry-matter loss and the
respective yields. The biochemical analysis of mushroom fruit bodies showed them to
be a rich source of protein (maximum 36.40 %) and sugars (maximum 41.58 %). The
study thus proved to be beneficial for effective management of the waste by
employing higher order fungi as well as obtaining nutrient-rich delicacy for the
mass.

Introduction
Bioconversion of agro-industrial wastes into value-added products is gaining
considerable importance in the recent years (Dashtban et al. 2009; Ingale and Ramteke 2010; Philippoussis and Diamantopoulou
2011). Concerted efforts are being
made worldwide to switch their status from ‘waste’ to ‘new resources’ (Philippoussis
and Diamantopoulou 2011).

Mushroom cultivation offers a highly efficient method capable of not only
biodegradation and bioremediation of agro-industrial waste but also
biotransformation into proteinaceous food that can sustain food security in the
developing countries (Bisaria et al. 1987; Ingale and Ramteke 2010; Kuforiji and Fasidi 2009; Kulshreshtha et al.2010; Mane et al.
2007; Narain et al. 2011; Philippoussis and Diamantopoulou
2011). A much smaller group of the
filamentous fungi, oyster mushrooms of genus Pleurotus, are efficient colonizers and bioconverters of
lignocellulosic agro-industrial residues into palatable human food with organoleptic
properties and nutritive value (Loss et al. 2009; Philippoussis et al. 2001). Due to a large variety of non-specific lignocellulosic
enzymes produced by the Pleurotus spp., they can
be cultivated on a number of agricultural wastes. Although paddy straw and wheat
straw are the traditional substrates for Pleurotus spp., different biological efficiencies have been reported
by various authors, viz., 11.66, 35.42–46.60 and 128 % for the former (Bisaria et
al. 1987; Ragunathan et al. 1996; Zhang et al. 2002) and 11.07, 75–100 and 97 % for the latter (Bisaria et al.
1987; Kirbag and Akyuz 2008; Philippoussis and Diamantopoulou
2011; Zhang et al. 2002). Other non-traditional substrates used alone
or in combination with the traditional substrates include cotton stalks (BE,
32.69–41.42 %) maize stover (BE, 25.18–35.39 %), coir pith (BE, 26.11–27.33 %),
sorghum stover (BE, 32.17–36.84 %), saw dust (BE, 73.5 %), banana leaves (BE,
10.25 %), mango leaves (BE, 5.96 %), bagasse (BE, 34.29–41.31 %), peanut shell, corn
cobs, coffee pulp, Populus deltoides, Eupatorium adenophorum, etc. (Bisaria et al. 1987; Ingale and Ramteke 2010; Madan et al. 1987; Moonmoon et al. 2010; Patrabansh and Madan 1997; Ragunathan and Swaminathan 2003; Sharma et al.2001). Among these residues is sugarcane bagasse,
one of the major by-products of sugarcane industries generated in abundance in
countries like India, Brazil, Egypt, etc. Several authors have utilized bagasse for
the production of Pleurotus mushrooms and found
that it could be used as a viable substrate for the mass production of the same,
either alone or with the addition of certain supplements (Bisaria et al.
1987; El-Sayed et al. 1994; Moda et al. 2005).

Substrate supplementation is a practice that shortens the crop period and also
increases mushroom productivity (Madan et al. 1987; Narain et al. 2011). Recently, few studies have considered the exploitation of
agro-industrial effluents as additives for the growth of Pleurotus spp. mushrooms (Kalmis and Sargin 2004; Loss et al. 2009; Narain et al. 2011; Pant et al. 2006; Philippoussis 2009; Ruiz-Rodriguez et al. 2010). The fact that these effluents are a rich source of organic
matter and nutrients (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, etc.) makes them
quite useful as substrate supplements that may help in the augmentation of mushroom
yield. For example, Narain et al. (2011) showed that low concentrations of dairy waste water (DWW),
which is rich in suspended solids, proteins, milk fat and other organics, could
increase the fruit body yield and biological efficiency (max 108.68 % at 10–20 %
supplementation) of two Pleurotus spp. grown on
wheat straw and corn cobs as basal substrates. Similarly, distillery spent wash
(DSW), besides showing beneficial effects on plants/cereals, has also been utilized
as a substrate amendment in the practice of mushroom cultivation. Pant et al.
(2006) have suggested the use of
wheat straw amended with spent wash effluent to increase the yield of the P. florida and P.
pulmonarius (max BE 238.6 % for P.
florida). These industrial effluents thus find a cheaper but an
efficient way of disposal.

The present study aims to investigate the influence of DWW and DSW effluents as
additives on the growth and yield of P.
flabellatus and P. sajor-caju on bagasse. It also aims to identify the appropriate
strains that are well suited to grow on DWW and DSW amended bagasse substrate. The
study would thus be useful for bioremediation of the above-mentioned residues along
with production of proteinaceous food for the mass.

Materials and methods
Preparation of substrate
The experiment was conducted over a span of 2 months from middle of November
to the middle of January, when there was no availability of bagasse in the Indian
sugar mills. Therefore, bagasse was collected from a local juice shop at Jaipur,
India. It was chopped into 3–4 cm pieces and dried in the oven at 60 °C. DWW was
obtained from Saras Dairy at Jaipur, Rajasthan and DSW from Dhampur sugar mill
industry, Delhi, India. These effluents were stored in glass containers at −20 °C
for the subsequent use. Prior to their use, these effluents were autoclaved at
121 °C and 15 psi for 20 min to make them free from any source of
contamination.

Mushroom spawn
The grain spawn of P. flabellatus (PF 1832)
and P.sajor-caju (PS 1610) were
procured from Bharat Mushroom Organisation, New Delhi, India.

Experimental setup
Completely dried, chopped bagasse substrate (4–5 cm) was soaked overnight with
water containing formalin (100 ml formalin in 100 l water). After this, the
bagasse was taken out, drained off excess water and then evenly spread on a
formalin-cleaned plastic sheet. It was allowed to dry to obtain an average
moisture content of 60 ± 1 %, calculated by drying 100 g of this bagasse in an
oven at 70 °C until constant weight was achieved.

2.5 kg wet bagasse (equivalent to 1 kg dry bagasse; moisture content 60 %) was
taken and the required amounts of each amendment (DWW and DSW) on dry-weight basis
were added and mixed properly. Table 1
lists the various substrate combinations designed for each Pleurotus spp. These amended substrates along with subsequent layers
of mushroom grain spawn (10 % of dry weight) and 5 ml Azotobacter broth (pH = 7;
cfu ~ 108 cells/ml), taken in place of gram powder as a
source of nitrogen (Eyini et al. 2005), were filled in the polythene bags (28 cm × 20 cm). Holes
were made in these polythene bags for proper aeration. Table 1 gives properties of the substrate combinations
before inoculation with Pleurotus spp.
Substrate combinations without the amendments, but containing Azotobacter broth and each of the Pleurotus spp. were taken as the respective
controls.Table 1 Substrate combinations designed for each Pleurotus spp. and their properties prior to
inoculation

The polythene bags were kept in a sterilized room with its temperature varying
between 17 and 22 °C. Spawn was run at 20–22 °C for about 3–4 weeks. After the
completion of spawn run, which was visible from the transparent polythene sheet as
a white mycelial growth over the substrate, the polythene bags were cut open.
Water was sprinkled regularly twice, at morning and afternoon, to develop fruit
bodies for about a period of 3 weeks. Mushrooms were harvested in three flushes,
each separated by a time interval of 4–6 days.

Yield and biological efficiency
The mushroom fruit bodies were harvested and fresh weight was noted. The
biological efficiency was calculated using the following formula (Bisaria et
al.1987):  

Chemical analysis
Pre and post chemical analysis (50 days after inoculation) of amended bagasse
substrate was done. Estimation of cellulose was done by acetolysis followed by
hydrolysis to form glucose units. These glucose units were then dehydrated and
reacted with anthrone to give a green colour product, absorbance of which was
measured at 630 nm using a spectrophotometer (Thimmaiah 1999). Hemicellulose and lignin were estimated
by determining neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF)
(Thimmaiah 1999).

For the effluents, pH and EC were measured using pH meter (Eutech Instruments
pH 510) and EC meter, respectively (Eutech Instruments CON 510), and total solids
and volatile solids were calculated by heating the samples in the oven (60–70 °C)
and muffle furnace (550 ± 5 °C), respectively. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) was
calculated following the protocol given by Pitwell (1983).

Nitrogen content of bagasse, effluents and mushroom fruit bodies was estimated
by the CHN analyzer (CHNOS Elementar, Vario EL III model). Flame photometer and
spectrophotometer were used for the determination of available potassium (K) and
available phosphorus (P), respectively (Rowell 1994). Moisture content of the mushroom fruit bodies was
calculated by heating them in the oven at 60–70 °C. After drying the mushroom
fruit bodies completely, ash content was obtained by heating them at 550 ± 5 °C
for about 5 h in a muffle furnace. The crude protein was calculated by multiplying
the nitrogen content by a factor of 4.38 (Fitzpatrick et al. 1946). The total soluble sugars in the fruit
bodies were estimated using the Anthrone method (Thimmaiah 1999). Fat content was measured using hexane as
the extracting solvent and heating at 60–65 °C in a soxhlet apparatus.

Statistical analysis
The data, collected in triplicates, was analyzed by one way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) using SPSS for windows (version 18.0). The significance of
difference was determined according to Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT).
P values <0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

Results and discussion
Pre analysis of the substrate
Chemical composition of the bagasse has been shown in Table 2. The various physico-chemical parameters of DWW and
DSW have been reported in Table 3.
Table 1 gives properties of the various
substrate combinations prior to inoculation with Pleurotus species. The moisture content of all the combinations
varied between 60 and 63 % and the nitrogen content between 1.30 and 1.35 %. It
can be seen from Tables 2 and 3, that bagasse has a little acidic pH whereas the
effluents are slightly alkaline in nature. However, on mixing the two in the
proportions designed, the pH ranged between 6.65 and 6.96 for all the substrate
combinations (Table 1), which was
desirable for the mushroom growth (Kalmis and Sargin 2004).Table 2 Composition of bagasse

Mushroom’s growth on amended substrate
The growth of the mushrooms on bagasse amended with DWW and DSW effluents was
monitored in terms of yield, biological efficiency and substrate dry-matter loss.
The effluents were tested at a concentration of 1, 5 and 10 % since at higher
concentrations; there were increased risks of contamination.

Bagasse amended with Dairy waste water (DWW)
Significant difference was observed in yield and biological efficiency for
the two mushroom species with respect to different usage of the dairy effluent
concentrations (Fig. 1a, b). Overall,
maximum biological efficiency (BE) of 66.63 ± 1.0 % was obtained for P. sajor-caju
grown on bagasse amended with 10 % DWW. The value of the highest biological
efficiency obtained in our study is more than the one obtained by Bisaria et
al. (1987) who reported a value of 8.33 % for the growth of
P. sajor-caju on bagasse and by Pant et al. (2006) where biological efficiency for the cultivation of
P. florida, P. sajor-caju and P.
pulmonaris on bagasse varied between 33.9 and 46.9 %. However,
Narain et al. (2011) observed that
highest BE’s of 108.68 and 91.27 % could be obtained for P. florida PF05 and P.
sajor-caju PS08 grown on wheat
straw and corn cob substrate combination (1:1) supplemented with 10 and 20 %
DWW, respectively. Nevertheless, for both the mushroom species used in the
present study, the biological efficiency increased with increasing
concentrations of DWW (Fig. 1b).
Although, bagasse is already rich in sugars and nitrogen (Table 2), supply of extra nutrients was ensured through
DWW supplementation. DWW is rich in nitrogen and contains considerable amounts
of lactose, milk fat, protein and lactic acid, phosphates, calcium, sulphate,
potassium, other minerals and some biodegradable constituents (Narain et al.
2011).The presence of these
nutrients in DWW thus accounts for its growth/yield promoting effects. This can
be fully supported by the work of Narain et al. (2011) where DWW supplementation (5–20 %) increased the growth
rate, ergosterol production, mycelia run, pin head formation and yield of
P. florida PF05 and P. sajor-caju PS08. Higher
concentrations (>20 %) were inhibitory due to the presence of excess nitrogen
which inhibited fungal growth and fruiting (Curvetto et al. 2002; Narain et al. 2009, 2011).Fig. 1 Graphs showing a yield,

(P < 0.05) using DMRT for a
particular species



Significant differences in the weight loss over the control were observed
for both the Pleurotus spp.
(Fig. 1c). Maximum substrate
dry-matter loss, i.e., 58.60 ± 0.44 % was observed for P. sajor-caju grown on bagasse
amended with 10 % DWW while a minimum loss of 43.17 ± 1.70 % was observed for
P. flabellatus control. These values correspond well with the
respective yields and biological efficiencies suggesting that the yields of the
mushroom fruit bodies were proportionate to the substrate dry-matter losses.
These findings also get supported by the work of Pant et al. (2006).

Bagasse amended with DSW
The total yields of the two mushroom species cultivated on bagasse amended
with different concentrations of DSW have been shown in Fig. 2a. With DSW, maximum biological efficiency of
63.75 ± 0.48 % was obtained for P.
flabellatus grown on bagasse with 5 % DSW and a minimum for the
P. sajor-caju control. This value of highest BE observed with DSW in our
present study is more than that obtained by Pant et al. (2006) who reported BE between 33.9 and 46.9 %
for bagasse but less than that reported for wheat straw (33.1–238.6 %), when
both were amended with different concentrations of DSW for the growth of
Pleurotus spp. studied. In case of
P. flabellatus in the present study, BE
increased significantly over the control on 1 % addition of DSW and further on
5 % addition. However, the addition of 10 % amendment caused a significant dip
in BE of the same. On the other hand, in case of P.
sajor-caju, BE increased sharply
over the control on addition of 1 % DSW but decreased on further addition of 5
and 10 % amendment (Fig. 2b). This may
be due to the fact that although spent wash was beneficial at lower
concentration, it inhibited the growth of the mushrooms at higher
concentrations. Similar observations were recorded by Pant et al. (2006) where productivity of P. sajor-caju and
P. pulmonarius was enhanced at lower
concentrations but declined at higher concentrations (>50 %) of DSW. Many
inhibitory effects with higher concentrations of DSW have been reported in
plants as well (Manunatha 2008;
Rath et al. 2010). Such inhibitory
effects might be attributed to high electrical conductivity (EC) of DSW
(>20 mS/cm) where excess of various forms of cations and anions might be
responsible for the reduction in the growth/yield (Manunatha 2008; Rath et al. 2010). Ayodele and Ojoghoro (2007) reported the effect of different salt
concentration on vegetative growth performance of P.
tuberregium, where they showed that the mushroom can tolerate or
utilise a wide range of salts at different concentrations. It was observed that
vegetative growth and development of P.
tuberregium was inhibited mostly by NaCl, MgCl and KCl, whereas
less inhibition was observed in MgSO4,
Na2SO4 and
K2SO4. The inhibitory effect was
more with chloride salts compared with sulphate salts at concentrations of 15
and 20 %. This may be due to the interference with uptake of water by the salts
which is very essential for growth and development of mushrooms.Fig. 2 Graphs showing a yield,
b biological efficiency (BE) and
c substrate dry-matter loss of
Pleurotus spp. grown on bagasse
amended with different concentrations of distillery spent wash (DSW).
Vertical bars over the histogram
indicate standard deviation (SD). Letters above the histogram bars indicate analysis of
variance (ANOVA). Bars with same
letters are statistically not different from each other
(P < 0.05) using DMRT for a
particular species



Overall, maximum yield of mushroom fruit bodies from bagasse amended with
10 % DWW can be explained due to the fact that DWW is a rich source of nutrients
and can be easily tolerated up to 10 % concentration. 10 % inclusion might have
provided enough nutrients suitable for the growth of mushroom fungi. Although
DSW has a better nutrient content (Rath et al. 2010; Suganya and Rajannan 2009), its increased concentration (10 %) becomes inhibitory
for the growth of mushroom, and therefore, even the availability of better
nutrient supply becomes unfavorable. The use of DSW at lower concentrations
might have been a poor source of nutrients compared to DWW effluent which could
be suitably tolerated up to 10 % inclusion. Thus, some of the macro and
micro-nutrients, which are important for plant growth and yield, become
unfavorable, beyond tolerance limit, and cause adverse effects (Baghel
2008).

The differences in the substrate dry-matter loss were significant between
control, 1 and 5 % addition of DSW effluent but non-significant at 10 % addition
for both the Pleurotus spp. However, the
trend within the same species for substrate dry-matter loss was similar to that
observed for yield and biological efficiency (Fig. 2c).The substrate dry-matter losses showed a maximum of
60.18 ± 1.73 % for P. sajor-caju grown on bagasse with 1 % DSW amendment and a
minimum for the P. flabellatus
control.

Biochemical analysis of mushroom fruit bodies
The biochemical composition of fruit bodies (average of three flushes) tested
has been reported in Table 4. The crude
protein in Pleurotus spp. varied between 27.86
to 36.40 % with a maximum for P.
sajor-caju grown on bagasse with
10 % DSW. The values fall well within the range of protein content of P. sajor-caju
(26.3–36.7 %) grown on different agro-wastes as studied by Bisaria et al.
(1987). The protein content of the
mushroom fruit bodies varies with the kind of the substrate chosen due to the
differential nature of the nutrient supply (Bisaria et al. 1987; Bonatti et al. 2004). On an average, mushrooms grown on bagasse
amended with DSW were found to be more proteinaceous than grown with DWW
amendment. This might be due to the fact that DSW has higher nitrogen content as
compared with the DWW (Rath et al. 2010). The same has been observed in our study also
(Table 3). Bagasse already contains a
large amount of residual sugar and some nitrogen which is readily available as a
nutrient source for the fungus (Pant et al. 2006). However, supplementation of the substrate with other
nitrogen/protein rich effluents might have led to increase in yield as well as
nutrient content (specifically protein content) of the mushroom fruit bodies. Our
results in this regard can also be corroborated by the findings of Narain et al.
(2011) where low concentrations of
DWW (up to 20 %) enhanced the protein content in the fruit bodies of P. florida and P.
sajor-caju and by Sukanya and Meli
(2003) and Manunatha (2008), where low concentration of DSW as a
nitrogen source improved the growth, yield and quality of the crops studied.Table 4 Biochemical Analysis of mushroom fruit bodies grown on bagasse

The total soluble sugar varied within the limits of 31.41–41.58 %, fat between
1.68 and 1.75 %, moisture content between 88.33 and 91.85 % and ash between narrow
limits of 7.8 and 8.2 %. These values fairly coincide with the ones reported by
Bisaria et al. (1987) and Ragunathan and Swaminathan (2003). However, no correlation could be drawn
between the yield and the percentage content of protein, total soluble sugars and
fat in the mushroom fruit bodies.

Degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin components of sugarcane
bagasse as a result of mushroom cultivation
Cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin were utilised by the mushrooms to varying
extents (Table 5). After 50 days of
incubation with Pleurotus spp., the amended bagasse substrate was altered
significantly. The percent degradation of each component varied with the
treatments.Table 5 Chemical analysis of bagasse substrate amended with DWW and DSW;

According to Pant et al. (2006),
dry-matter loss starts from the very first day of inoculation, whereas lignin
degradation starts at a later stage. The fungus utilises the soluble carbohydrates
in the initial stages, as a result of which, significant percentage dry-matter
reduction occurs. After primary growth of fungus, lignin degradation starts and
cellulose is freed from lignocellulosic complex and the digestibility increases
continuously. Thus, soluble carbohydrate and hemicellulose are consumed as an
energy source prior to cellulose and lignin, at the stage of mycelial growth
(Carmen 2009). In our experiments
also, both strains of Pleurotus spp. degraded
hemicellulose and lignin more selectively than cellulose. Out of the weight losses
of chemical components in substrate during culture, the decrease in hemicellulose
was the most remarkable from spawn inoculation to harvest of the fruit-bodies
(0–50 days) being highest (40.80 %) in P.
sajor-caju grown on bagasse with
10 % DWW and lowest (22.80 %) in P. flabellatus
control. Lignin degradation was highest (29.30 %) in P.
flabellatus grown on bagasse amended with 10 % DWW and lowest
(18.27 %) in P. sajor-caju control. Cellulose was the component which was degraded the
least during the growth of mushrooms. These results can also be corroborated by
the work of Mukherjee and Nandi (2004), Pant et al. (2006), Carmen (2009) and Isikhuemhen and Mikiashvili (2009). Various authors have also tried to
establish a correlation between lignocellulosic degradation and biological
efficiency (Isikhuemhen and Mikiashvili 2009; Isikhuemhen et al.2008; Wang et al.
2001). In our study, a significant
correlation was obtained between the extent of degradation of these components
(mainly hemicelluloses and lignin), substrate dry-matter loss and the biological
efficiency within a particular species at different concentrations of an amendment
used. Greater losses in the hemicellulose and lignin content lead to greater
substrate dry-matter loss and hence improved yields/biological efficiency. These
findings can again be well supported by the work of Pant et al. (2006).

Conclusions
From the present study, we find that DWW and DSW effluents could be suitably
used at low concentrations for enhancing the Pleurotus mushroom productivity. While P.
sajor-caju (PS 1610) performed
better on bagasse amended with DWW, P.
flabellatus (PF 1832) was more suited to grow on DSW amended bagasse.
Although these effluents could be used at very low concentrations (5 and 10 % for
DSW and DWW, respectively) in the substrate combinations, mushroom cultivation still
proved to be one of the highly simple, beneficial and an economic method for
disposing off the agricultural residues, such as bagasse, along with effective
utilisation of the industrial effluents which are generated in abundance annually.
Other methods for bioremediation of the industrial effluents could be further
explored.

For a particular mushroom species, the degradation of hemicellulose and lignin
was in accordance with the substrate dry-matter loss and so were the yield and
biological efficiency. Greater losses in the dry-matter lead to higher yields, and
hence, improved biological efficiency. In addition, the mushroom fruit bodies
obtained with the use of effluent amendments had a higher protein content compared
to that of the controls. The study is important from the point of view of resource
recovery. Thus, on the basis of higher yields, improved biological efficiency and
richer protein content, DWW and DSW effluents (when used at lower concentrations)
appear as a suitable option for substrate amendment of bagasse for Pleurotus species cultivation.
