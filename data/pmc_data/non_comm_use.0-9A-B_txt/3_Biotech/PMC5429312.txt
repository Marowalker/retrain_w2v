Introduction

Lens, commonly known as lentil, is a self-pollinated diploid (2n = 2x = 14) crop from Vicieae tribe of Fabaceae family with a haploid genome size of 4063 Mbps (Arumuganathan and Earle 1991). It is comprised of the cultivated lentil (Lens culinaris Medik. ssp. culinaris) and six related wild taxa (Ferguson et al. 2000). The species L. culinaris Medikus has three wild subspecies: L. culinaris ssp. orientalis, L. culinaris ssp. odemensis and L. culinaris ssp. tomentosus (Ferguson et al. 2000); among these, L. culinaris ssp. orientalis is considered to be the progenitor of cultivated lentil. The other three wild species are L. ervoides, L. nigricans and L. lamottei (Van Oss et al. 1997). The cultivated lentil has been divided into two market classes, namely macrosperma having seed diameter range from 6 to 9 mm and microsperma having seed diameter range from 2 to 6 mm (Barulina 1930). The distribution and cultivation area of lentil ranges from Indian subcontinent to Northern Africa, Western Asia, Southern Europe, North and South America, and Australia (Rubeena and Taylor 2003). Thus, it is one of the major pulse crops of the world and requires advanced breeding and improvement programmes to develop high-yielding varieties which should be resistant to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the knowledge of genetic variation and species relationships of lentil germplasm is not well understood yet which is important for its improvement in future. Genetic variations within populations of a crop species have been of major interest for plant breeders and geneticists for the introgression of desired genes from one species to other for improvement of a trait (Hayward and Breese 1993). Regarding lentil, cultivation and breeding programme in the past have relied mainly on local landraces of L. culinaris ssp. culinaris. Thus, unlike other food legumes, lentil has lagged behind in terms of genetic improvement for yield and other major traits (Gupta and Sharma 2006). Evaluation and screening of wild accessions for genetic diversity can help in tapping the unexplored variability and its probable use in lentil improvement. Several attempts have been made to examine the diversity and phylogeny of lentil using seed protein (Hoffman et al. 1986), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) (Havey and Muehlbauer 1989; Abo-Elwafa et al. 1995; Sharma et al. 1995, 1996). However, few studies were reported where robust marker systems such as SSR were used for genetic analysis of lentil (Liu et al. 2008; Kushwaha et al. 2013, 2015). Thus, in the present study we utilized morphological and SSR markers to estimate the genetic structure and interrelationships in cultivated and wild lentil germplasm.

Materials and methods
Plant material
One hundred and thirty accessions of lentil were included in the present study. These accessions were procured from International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA), Ethiopia, and National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi. Among these, 87 were wild lentil accessions belonging to five species/sub-species (L. culinaris ssp. odemensis, L. culinaris ssp. orientalis, L. nigricans, L. ervoides and L. lamottei) and 43 were cultivated landraces/varieties belonging to L. culinaris ssp. culinaris. A detailed account of plant material is given in Supplementary Table 1. The present investigation was carried out in the Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture, CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University, Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, India.

Morphological analysis
Field data were recorded on five plants of each accession. Seven quantitatively measured traits were recorded during cropping season 2013–2014. These seven traits were number of branches/plant, plant height, number of seeds per plant, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, 100-seed weight and seed diameter.

DNA extraction and SSR genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh leaves using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Doyle and Doyle 1990). After extraction, dried DNA pellet was dissolved in 1 ml TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The dissolved DNA was treated with RNase (10 mg/ml). The quantity and quality of DNA were estimated through electrophoresis using 0.8 percent agarose gel (Himedia). Further, quantified DNA was made into working stocks as per Sharma et al. 2015a, b. Thirty-one SSR primers showing polymorphic and reproducible bands were selected based on the published reports (Hamwieh et al. 2005; Phan et al. 2007; Saha et al. 2010). PCR reactions were comprised of 10 µl reaction volume as per Sharma et al. (2009). The total PCR reaction volume contained 20 ng of template DNA, 15 ng of each primer, 200 µM of each dNTP, 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCL, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR amplifications were carried out in Gene Amp PCR System 9700® (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The amplification products were electrophoresed in 3% agarose gel (Himedia) and stained with ethidium bromide. The gels were visualized and photographed using the Gel-Documentation Unit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

Data analysis
Morphological data were analysed for mean, range, coefficient of variance, correlation coefficient and genetic diversity to deduce the genetic similarity/dissimilarity. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using the statistical software PLP Minitab, SYSTAT-12 and StatistiXL version 1.10. For molecular data, all SSR primers alleles were scored manually and the polymorphism information content (PIC) of each primer pair was calculated according to the formula given by Botstein et al. (1980) and implemented in Cervus version 3.0 (Kalinowski et al. 2007). Other genetic diversity estimates such as expected heterozygosity (H
e), observed heterozygosity (H
o), Shannon information index (I), etc. were calculated with the help of POPGENE version 1.32 (Yeh and Boyle 1997). Neighbour-joining (N-J) tree was constructed using Dice coefficient with the help of DARwin (Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet 2006). Bootstrapping with 1000 replicates was also performed with DARwin. Bayesian model-based clustering method implemented in STRUCTURE software, version: 2.3.3 (Pritchard et al. 2000; Falush et al. 2007) was utilized to assess the genetic structure at population level as well as to detect genetic stocks contributing to this germplasm collection. Ancestry model with admixture and correlated allele frequency model were set to get the estimates of posterior probability of data. STRUCTURE was run by setting the value of K from 1 to 10 with three iterations for each value of K. Length of burn-in period was set at 100,000 and number of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) repeats after burn-in were set at 100,000. Evanno’s method (Evanno et al. 2005) based programme, STRUCTURE HARVESTER, developed by Earl and Vonholdt (2011), was used to determine the value of estimated Ln probability of data-LnP(K) and to get the best fit value of K for the data. STRUCTURE was run for all genotypes collectively and separately for accessions of L. culinaris ssp. culinaris to assess their genetic structure at species level. Genetic differentiation (F
st) estimates for each cluster were also detected by STRUCTURE. Genetic relationships among the genotypes were analysed by Factorial analysis using DARwin (Perrier and Jacquemoud-Collet 2006). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) was performed using GenAlex 6.4 program (Peakall and Smouse 2006).

Results
Morphological evaluation
The analysed lentil accessions revealed significant variations (p = 0.05) as was evident from analysis of variance, range, mean and coefficient of variation for all the quantitative traits studied (Supplementary Table 2; Fig. 1). Across all lentil species, the number of branches per plant was lowest (2.3) in Precoz (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris) and highest (64.6) in EC619872 (L. nigricans) with a mean value of 14.7. Plant height was observed minimum (7.3 cm) in EC619674 (L. culinaris ssp. orientalis) and maximum (66.6 cm) in Lcc13 (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris) with a mean value of 36.7. The number of seeds per plant was lowest (17.3) in EC619674 (L. culinaris ssp. orientalis) while highest value (261.3) for number of seeds per plant was observed in accession EC619872 (L. nigricans) with a mean value of 132.7. The number of pods per plant was lowest (17.3) in accession EC619674 (L. culinaris ssp. orientalis), whereas it was highest (197.6) in Lcc51 (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris) with a mean value of 98.3. Number of seeds per pod did not show much variation as it ranged from 1.00 to 2.00 with a mean value of 1.41. The trait, 100-seed weight showed significant variation which varied from 0.2 g in EC619654 (L. culinaris ssp. orientalis) to 10.4 g in Lcc187 (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris) with a mean value of 2.5. The lowest (1.9 mm) seed diameter was recorded in accession EC619860 (L. ervoides), while highest (5.3 mm) value of the trait was observed in Precoz (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris) with a mean value of 3.1 mm. Further, the bivariate correlation coefficients among seven quantitatively measured traits showed significant positive correlation between the traits (Supplementary Table 3). The number of seeds per plant showed significant positive correlation (r = 0.23; p < 0.01) with number of branches per plant while number of pods per plant showed positive correlation (r = 0.80; p < 0.01) with number of seeds per plant. 100-seed weight was associated (r = 0.66; p < 0.01) with plant height while seed diameter showed significant positive correlation (r = 0.72; p < 0.01) with 100-seed weight. The degree of association was maximum between seed diameter and plant height followed by 100-seed weight. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on quantitative traits grouped the lentil accessions into five groups. Euclidean dissimilarity matrices varied from 3.59 between EC 619700 (L. ervoides, Turkey) and EC619857 (L. ervoides, Syrian Arab Republic) to 20,479.53 between Lcc170 (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, Ethiopia) and Lcc187 (L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, Ethiopia). PCA showed that the first principal component (PC1) explained 42.40% of the total variance, followed by PC2 (29.20%) and PC3 (14.80%) as shown in Supplementary Table 4.Fig. 1 Biplot of different variables on PC1 and PC2 based on morphological traits data




SSR polymorphism
All 31 lentil SSRs utilized in this study amplified unambiguous and reliable alleles. In total, 31 loci amplified 139 alleles with an average of 4.48 alleles per primer (Table 1). Size of alleles ranged from 50 to 650 bp. Primer pair SSR-156 amplified maximum of ten alleles, whereas SSR-204, CALTL, LG111 and GLLC-607 amplified minimum of two alleles each. The polymorphic information content (PIC) value ranged from 0.02 in primer CALTL to 0.85 in primer SSR-156 with an average of 0.46. Highest (0.87) and lowest (0.02) expected heterozygosity (H
e) values were obtained with SSR-156 and CALTL, respectively, with an average of 0.50. Highest (0.97) observed heterozygosity (H
O) was obtained with primer pair LSSR1b. Shannon’s Information index (I) was recorded maximum (2.13) for SSR-156, whereas the lowest value (0.05) was observed for CALTL with an average of 0.96.Table 1 Diversity statistics for 31 SSR loci studied in 130 lentil accessions

Bayesian genetic structure
STRUCTURE grouped all the accessions into five clusters (Fig. 2). Accessions belonging to L. culinaris ssp. culinaris were grouped into two separate clusters, i.e. cluster-II and cluster-IV; one of them contained accessions of only Ethiopian origin (cluster-II). All other accessions of cultivated lentil were clustered in a single group (cluster-IV) with some extent of admixtures in few accessions. Majority of accessions belonging to L. ervoides were grouped into a single cluster (cluster-III). Few accessions of this species were also dispersed with accessions in other clusters (cluster-I and cluster-IV). L. culinaris ssp. odemensis formed cluster-V. A very low admixture recorded in the accessions of this cluster indicated their pure ancestry, which could be attributed to a conservative genetic background. Cluster-I mainly comprised accessions of L. culinaris ssp. orientalis with some mixed accessions of other species. As accessions of L. culinaris ssp. culinaris were found distributed in two clusters, with few accessions dispersed across other clusters, further assessment of the population structure within L. culinaris ssp. culinaris was performed to understand the species complexity. STRUCTURE analysis showed the existence of three groups in the species, with Ethiopian accessions forming a separate gene pool (Supplementary Fig. 1). Wright’s fixation index F
st, which is a measure of genetic differentiation, was found to be 0.16 overall indicating moderate levels of genetic differentiation. It was recorded highest (F
st = 0.24) between L. culinaris ssp. odemensis and L. ervoides. Genetic differentiation between L. ervoides and L. culinaris ssp. culinaris was also found to be high (F
st = 0.23). The lowest genetic differentiation (F
st = 0.11) was recorded between L. culinaris ssp. orientalis and L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, which are taxonomically closer to each other and the former designated as progenitor species of cultivated lentil.Fig. 2 Genetic structure of 130 lentil accessions as inferred by STRUCTURE v2.3.3 with SSR markers data set. The five inferred clusters are shown with different colours





Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis using N-J tree indicated six clusters for wild and cultivated lentil accessions (Fig. 3). High bootstrap values were shown for all the nodes formed in the neighbour-joining tree. Of the 43 cultivated L. culinaris ssp. culinaris accessions, Ethiopian accessions clustered together in a cluster, named L. culinaris ssp. culinaris (E), whereas all other accessions of this species grouped into two different clusters. Accessions of L. culinaris ssp. orientalis largely grouped in a single cluster with few exceptions and showed integrity as a species complex. L. culinaris ssp. odemensis formed a distinct group with majority of accession while six accessions deviated from this cluster and were dispersed into three different clusters. Two accessions of L. nigricans clustered separately in two clusters of wild lentil. Single accession of L. lamottei grouped in parent cluster of L. culinaris ssp. odemensis. The most conservative grouping was shown by accessions of L. ervoides species while only two accessions of this species went out of the parent cluster. Overall, majority of the accessions clustered according to existing taxonomic hierarchy except few deviations. While recording distantness on the basis of similarities between accessions we found that wild lentil accessions viz., EC619700 (L. ervoides, Turkey) and EC619654 (L. culinaris ssp. orientalis, Syrian Arab Republic) were most distant with a dissimilarity value of 0.96. Factorial analysis confirmed the results of N-J clustering as it resulted into almost similar clustering pattern as shown in Fig. 4. In factorial analysis, first two principal coordinates explained 40.64% cumulative variations. AMOVA revealed that a major portion (82%) of genetic variance resided within species, while a lesser part (18%) of genetic variance resided among species (Table 2).Fig. 3 Radial neighbour-joining tree based on 139 alleles from 31 SSR loci among 130 lentil accessions belonging to six species.

Discussion
Morphological evaluation
Lentil accessions analysed in the present study have shown high morphological diversity for the traits studied and, therefore, accessions from analysed germplasm can be a valuable resource for lentil improvement programme. The highest number of seeds and maximum number of branches were observed in L. nigricans, a wild species of lentil. This important characteristic of L. nigricans can make it a potential donor for breeding experiments aiming to increase the number of seeds per plant. Earlier workers have also advocated the need to give more emphasis on such traits for improving the lentil productivity (Roopam and Singh 2014). The significant variation for morphological traits observed in lentil could be due to the diverse origin of these species as also inferred by Singh et al. (2014). The number of branches per plant and number of seeds per plant were higher in the wild L. nigricans accession EC619872 collected/originated from Turkey. The maximum plant height was recorded in the accessions of L. culinaris ssp. culinaris and lowest in L. ervoides. However, the wild annual L. culinaris ssp. orientalis accession EC619662 collected from Turkey also showed increased plant height. L. nigricans accession EC619872 collected from Turkey was superior for number of seeds per plant and number of pods per plant. Range and mean for 100-seed weight and seed diameter were found maximum in accessions of L. culinaris ssp. odemensis and L. lamottei collected from Turkey and Spain, respectively. It is important to note that wild accessions collected from Turkey exhibited substantial variations for useful agro-morphological traits. These promising accessions of Lens culinaris ssp. orientalis, L. culinaris ssp. odemensis, L. nigricans and L. lamottei can be exploited for broadening the genetic base of cultivated lentil. Correlation analysis also showed some significant associations between few traits of importance. The number of seeds per plant showed significant positive correlation with number of branches per plant while number of pods per plant showed positive correlation with number of seeds per plant. 100-seed weight was associated with plant height while seed diameter showed significant positive correlation with 100-seed weight. These estimates of correlation will be helpful in planning breeding strategies in the species (Singh et al. 2008; Tyagi and Khan 2011; Singh et al. 2012). Moreover, they have suggested that seed yield in lentil can be increased by selecting ideotypes having more number of branches per plant, more seeds per plant, more pods per plant, increased plant height, increased 100-seed weight and seed diameter (Younis et al. 2008). Clustering based on morphological traits and Euclidian distance depicted five groups for entire germplasm but it did not show any correlation with geographic occurrence of accessions, which was in accordance with a study in lentil by Singh et al. (2014). Further, the lack of robustness in the dendrogram may be attributed to less numbers of phenotypic traits studied. PCA showed that PC1 was the most important and explained 42.4% of the total variance, which was mainly contributed by number of branches per plant, number of seeds per plant, number of pods per plant and number of seeds per pod. PC2 accounted for 29.2% variation and was attributed to number of pods per plant, number of seeds per plant, plant height, seed diameter and number of branches per plant. PC3 contributed 14.8% of the total variance through number of seeds per pod. The loading plot drawn for PC1 and PC2 (Fig. 1) also indicated the importance of different morphological traits for explaining the variance among accessions. The high morphological variability observed here is in consonance with observations of Bacchi et al. (2010) and Kumar et al. (2014).

SSR polymorphism
Genetic diversity revealed by SSR primers was high which was supported by the recorded high values of mean allele numbers, heterozygosity, PIC and other diversity indices. Average number of 4.48 alleles recorded in present work was higher than that obtained in the previous study by Kumar et al. (2014), whereas it was lower than the mean number of alleles recorded by Bacchi et al. (2010). However, mean heterozygosity and PIC of 0.50 and 0.46, respectively, were lower than those observed in other studies carried out in lentil (Liu et al. 2008; Andeden et al., 2013; Kumar et al. 2014). Average Shannon’s Information Index (I) value of 0.96 was also lower than that observed by Liu et al. (2008). Further, species-wise analysis also revealed high genetic diversity within the accessions of L. culinaris spp. orientalis, of which most of the accessions were from Syrian Arab Republic, Uzbekistan, Turkey, Iran, Cyprus and Russian Federation. Ferguson and Robertson (1996) found that L. culinaris ssp. orientalis possessed the high diversity based on morphological characters compared to isozymes markers. They also reported high genetic diversity based on RAPD analysis in L. culinaris spp. orientalis accessions from Jordan, Palestine, and southern Syria, with slightly lower diversity in those accessions from northwest Syria and southeast Turkey (Ferguson 1998a). Hamwieh et al. (2009) also observed high genetic diversity within L. culinaris ssp. orientalis accessions originating from the Fertile Crescent (the north and south of Syria, Turkey, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Cyprus, and Palestine). Similarly, accessions of L. culinaris ssp. odemensis have shown diverse genetic background in our study that is in agreement with the findings of Hamwieh et al. (2009). Moreover, we observed lowest genetic relatedness (0.04) between L. ervoides from Turkey and L. culinaris ssp. orientalis from Syrian Arab Republic which might be due to their diverse geographical origin and distant phylogenies.

Bayesian genetic structure
STRUCTURE assigned all the accessions into five (K = 5) clusters. Unexpectedly, accessions of L. culinaris spp culinaris were divided into two clusters: cluster-II representing mixed accessions and cluster-IV representing accessions from Ethiopia. This indicated that cultivated lentil has differentiated and formed unique allelic combinations as a result of geographical isolation. The study also revealed that cultivated lentil species has two gene pools. Study by Alo et al. (2011) supports this fact as they have also observed two different groups in STRUCTURE analysis for domesticated lentil accessions. The diversified nature of cultivated lentil was further supported by STRUCTURE analysis when it was performed only on cultivated accessions, which showed presence of three clusters in it (Supplementary Fig. 1). Further, wild relatives of L. culinaris, namely L. culinaris ssp. orientalis and L. culinaris ssp. odemensis, formed two different clusters, i.e. cluster-I and cluster-III, respectively. Wild species L. ervoides clustered separately in cluster-V, which also included one accession of L. nigricans. The separate clustering of L. culinaris ssp. culinaris and L. culinaris ssp. orientalis was concordant with Dikshit et al. (2015) who also reported structuring of accessions according to their cultivated and wild nature. Based on STRUCTURE analysis Wong et al. (2015) divided cultivated and wild lentil species into four different gene pools, i.e. primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary gene pools. However, STRUCTURE analysis in present study assigned accessions into three gene pools defined by them, which included L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, and L. culinaris ssp. orientalis in primary, L. odemensis and L. lamottie in secondary and L. ervoides and L. nigricans in tertiary gene pool. Further, Wright’s F
st values between different species suggested that L. culinaris odemensis and L. ervoides were the most divergent species, while L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, and L. culinaris ssp. orientalis were found to be most similar among analysed accessions. This fact was in consonance with earlier studies by Ahmad and McNeil (1996) and Ladizinsky (1999) who reported poor or negligible crossability between L. ervoids and cultivated species and close relationship between L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, and L. culinaris ssp. orientalis.

Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogeny of Lens genus largely remained unambiguous. Inclusion of seven taxa in this genus was agreed upon by most of the workers (Ferguson et al. 2000). However, many earlier and contemporary researchers have reported a major controversial aspect in this phylogenetic classification and that is distantness of L. culinaris ssp. odemensis from L. culinaris (Sonnante et al. 2003; Duran and Perez de la Vega 2004; Wong et al. 2015). According to Fergusion et al. (2000) genus Lens comprises seven taxa. These are L. culinaris with four of its sub species, namely L. culinaris ssp. culinaris, L. culinaris ssp. orientalis, L. culinaris ssp. tomentosus and L. culinaris ssp. odemensis, while other three species are L. nigricans, L. lamottei and L. ervoides. In our study, we have also followed this existing system for entire germplasm analysed. But, N-J clustering of the present study depicted that L. culinaris ssp. odemensis clustered differently from its parent species L. culinaris and seems to be an entirely different entity. Therefore, we propose revisiting of the taxonomic status of this taxon and advocate its existence to a rank of independent species. This fact is in agreement with a recent finding of Wong et al. (2015), who characterized Lens species and revisited its classification using genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach. The separate clustering of L. culinaris ssp odemensis from L. culinaris was in opposition to study conducted by Alo et al. (2011). However, they also suggested the revision of existing classification of Lens. The close relation between L. culinaris ssp culinaris and L. culinaris ssp orientalis was observed as also reported by other workers (Sharma et al. 1996; Mayer and Bagga 2002; Sonnante et al. 2003; Duran and Perez de la Vega 2004; Fikiru et al. 2010; Reddy et al. 2010; Alo et al. 2011; Singh et al. 2014; Dikshit et al. 2015; Wong et al. 2015). L. ervoides appeared as a conservative cluster and can be considered a distant relative of cultivated species and sub-species. Accession of L. lamottei clustered closely with L. culinaris ssp odemensis. Similar findings were reported by Verma et al. (2014) and Wong et al. (2015) while two accessions of L. nigricans clustered separately from each other and one accession (LnigEC619872) showed affinity to L. ervoides which was in concurrence with earlier studies (Fikiru et al. 2010; Wong et al. 2015). Grouping of the other L. nigricans accession (LnigEC619873) with L. culinaris ssp orientalis and deviation of few other accessions from their parent clusters need further investigations with larger sample size. The clustering pattern of N-J tree was supported by factorial analysis as the grouping of accessions was nearly identical to the phylogenetic tree. Furthermore, partitioning of genetic variance within and between species indicated that larger variance was harboured within species while a very small portion was harboured between the species which indicated that frequency of gene flow within species is very high than that between species.

In conclusion, the morphological traits and SSR data have revealed high genetic diversity among both cultivated and wild lentil genotypes analysed in this study. Genetic structuring showed five different genetic stocks for entire germplasm suggesting broad genetic background of the crop. Moreover, structure analysis of cultivated lentil accessions revealed Ethiopian accessions as a different gene pool. Clustering patterns of N-J tree can be useful for resolving phylogenetic and taxonomic issues in this genus. Phenotypic traits showing correlation with seed yield can be employed for the development of high-yielding varieties in lentil. Overall, the results of present work provide important genetic information which can be useful for lentil breeding programmes and taxonomic inferences in lentil species.
