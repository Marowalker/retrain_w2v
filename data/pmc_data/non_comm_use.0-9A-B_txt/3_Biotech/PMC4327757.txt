Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2297 with statistical
approaches. Biosurfactant production from P.
aeruginosa 2297 was carried out with different carbon sources, and
maximum yield was achieved with sawdust followed by groundnut husk and glycerol. The
produced biosurfactant has showed active emulsification and surface-active
properties. From the kinetic growth modeling, the specific growth rate was
calculated on sawdust and it was 1.12 day−1. The maximum
estimated value of product yield on biomass growth (Yp/x) was 1.02 g/g. The important medium components identified by the
Plackett–Burman method were sawdust and glycerol along with culture parameter pH.
Box–Behnken response surface methodology was applied to optimize biosurfactant
production. The obtained experimental result concludes that Box–Behnken designs are
very effective statistical tools to improve biosurfactant production. These results
may be useful to develop a high efficient production process of biosurfactant. In
addition, this type of kinetic modeling approach may constitute a useful tool to
design and scaling-up of bioreactors for the production of biosurfactant.

Introduction
Microbial surfactants are structurally different group of surface-active
biomolecules produced by a variety of microorganisms and are receiving considerable
attention due to their unique properties such as higher biodegradability, lower
toxicity, and greater stability (Mukherjee et al. 2006; Mulligan 2005).
Biosurfactants are predominantly produced by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts include
glycolipids, lipoaminoacids, lipopeptides, lipoproteins, lipopolysaccharides,
phospholipids, monoglycerides, and diglycerides. Among these, the glycolipids
produced by strains of Pseudomonas have received
much attention due to their notable tensioactive and emulsifying properties (Maier
and Soberon-Chavez 2000; Mulligan
2005). However, biosurfactants have
limited applications owing to their high production costs, which can be lowered by
process optimization, downstream processing strategies, agro-industrial waste
fermentation, and use of hyper-producer strains (e.g., mutant and recombinant
strains) (Wei et al. 2004; Perfumo et
al. 2010). One of the methods which
accomplished the above objective is the selection of suitable media components and
optimal culture conditions to enhance biosurfactant productivity. The limitations of
classical method of media optimization can be overcome by the application of single
factor optimization process by statistical experimental design using Plackett–Burman
design and response surface methodology (RSM) (Lotfy et al. 2007; Tanyildizi et al. 2005).

The Plackett–Burman design is a widely used statistical design technique for the
screening of the medium components, and the variables screened by Plackett–Burman
design were further optimized in a 23 factorial
Box–Behnken design methodology (Plackett and Burman 1944; Box 1952).
Response surface methodology (RSM) is the extensively used statistical technique for
media optimization and for designing experiments, evaluating the effects of factor
and relative significance and searching the optimum factors related to desired
response. It has the intense ability to interpret the interactive effects among
input variables are some attractive features of RSM (Al-Araji et al. 2007; Montgomery 1997). In the present study, we have applied response surface
methodology (RSM) to enhance the production of biosurfactant by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2297.

Materials and methods
Test organism
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 2297) was obtained
from the microbial type culture collection (MTCC), Chandigarh, India, and it was
maintained on nutrient slants at 4 °C.

Examination of biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Oil spreading method and oil collapse method
Oil spreading technique and oil collapsed method were carried out according
to the method (Youssef et al. 2004).

Optimization of carbon and renewable sources for enhanced production of
biosurfactant
P. aeruginosa was cultivated in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing
50 ml mineral salt medium (MSM) (g/l) (Camilios et al. 2008). To this medium, different carbon sources
(2 %), i.e., glycerol, glucose, coconut oil, and groundnut oil, and different
renewable sources (10 %), i.e., rice bran, sawdust, groundnut husk, and wheat
bran, were added and sterilized at 121 °C, 15 lbs pressure for 15 min. After
sterilization, the flasks were cooled to room temperature, and then, 2 % of
overnight culture was inoculated and incubated at 30 °C in an orbital shaker for
6 days. For every 24 h, the broth was collected to analyze growth and
biosurfactant production and their emulsification and surface activities.

Experimental design and statistical analysis
Plackett–Burman design
To find out the important medium components, a Plackett–Burman design was
applied and it is a design of fractional plan. It allows the investigation of up
to N − 1 variables with N experiments and assumes that there are no
interactions between the different media components. For this study, six
components were selected to evaluate their effect on biosurfactant production in
12 experiments, and surface tension was used as a response. Each column
represents a different experimental trial, and each row represents different
variables. Each variable was tested at two levels, a higher (+) and a lower (–)
level (Table 1).Table 1 High and low levels of factors with coded settings by

Response surface methodology
The optimized concentrations and interactions between the significant factors
were identified by Plackett–Burman design and studied by using response surface
methodology. RSM was used for experimental design based on the Box–Behnken design
algorithm. The factors settings were tabulated (Table 3). MATLAB version 7.7.0 (R2008b) was used to create a 3-factor
Box–Behnken design. The generalized polynomial model of three factors was as
follows: 1 Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+β3X3+β12X1X2+β13X1X3+β23X2X3+β11X12+β22X22+β33X32 where Y––predicted response of
fermentation X1, X2 and X3 are the coded settings for three factors β0––value of fitted response at the center point of the
design β1, β2, and β3––linear coefficients β12, β13, and β23––interaction coefficients β11, β22, and β33––quadratic coefficients.

Emulsification index (E24)
The emulsifying capacity was evaluated by an emulsification index (E24). The E24 of culture samples was determined by adding 2 ml of oil
and 2 ml of the cell-free broth to a test tube, vortexed at high speed for 2 min,
and allowed to stand for 24 h. The E24 index is given as percentage of the height of emulsified
layer (cm) divided by the total height of the liquid column (cm). The percentage
of emulsification index was calculated by using the following equation (Tabatabaee
et al. 2005; Sarubbo et al.
2006). E24=Height of emulsion formed×100/total height of solution. 

Extraction of biosurfactant
Initially, culture supernatant was adjusted to pH of 2.0 by adding 5 mol/l
H2SO4 for precipitation of
biosurfactant. The precipitates were extracted with two volumes of ethyl acetate.
After vacuum evaporation of the solvents using rotary evaporator, crude
biosurfactant was extracted with pellet form. The yielded pellets were applied
onto thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Solvent mixture used in this study was
chloroform, methanol, and water (65:25:4, V/V/V). Biosurfactant spots were
detected by using orcinol reagent (Zhang Guo-liang et al. 2005).

Quantification of biosurfactant by orcinol method
The culture supernatant is acidified to pH 2 with 5 mol/l
H2SO4 and kept at 4 °C overnight.
Two hundred microliters of acidified culture supernatant was extracted three times
with 1 ml of diethyl ether. Then, fractions were pooled, dried, and resuspended in
1 ml of 0.05 M sodium bicarbonate. Two hundred microliters of sample was treated
with 1.8 ml of a orcinol solution (100 mg orcinol in 53 %
H2SO4 and boiled for 20 min).
After cooling at room temperature for 15 min, the readings are taken at 421 nm.
Biosurfactant concentration was calculated from standard curves prepared with
l-rhamnose and expressed as rhamnose equivalents (in mg/ml) (Chandrasekaran and
BeMiller 1980; Koch et al.
1991).

Determination of surface tension
For surface tension measurements, 5 ml of broth supernatant was transferred to
a glass tube that was submerged in a water bath at a constant temperature (28 °C).
Surface tension was calculated by measuring the height reached by the liquid when
freely ascended through a capillary tube (Munguia and Smith 2001). As control, non-inoculated broth was
used, and the surface tension was calculated according to the following
formula: γ=rhδg2 γ = surface tension (mN/m); d = density (g/ml); g = gravity (980 cm/s2); r = capillary radius (0.05 cm); h = height of the liquid column (cm).

Bacterial growth and dry cell weight
Cell growth was determined by monitoring the optical density of culture broth
at 600 nm. The biomass was determined from the cells after centrifugation of the
culture broth at 10,000 rpm (6,700g) 4 °C for
10 min. The dry cell weight (DCW) was obtained from the cell pellets by washing
twice with distilled water and drying in hot air oven at 105 °C for 24 h
(Suwansukho et al. 2008).

Kinetic model for growth and glycolipid product
Logistic equation: The sigmoidal shape of batch growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can be given as 2 dXdt=μX1-XX∞ where μ: specific growth rate,
X∞: maximum biomass concentration.

Logistic equations are a set of equations that characterize growth in terms of
specific growth rate (Shuler and Kargi 2003). The integration of Eq. (2) with the boundary condition X(0) = X0 yields the logistic curve. 3 X=X0eμt1-X0X∞1-eμt 

The above equation can be written as follows: 4 μ=1X¯ΔXΔt1X¯ΔXΔt1-X¯X∞1-X¯X∞ 

X¯: Average biomass concentration.

Leudeking–Piret model: Bio-products are classified as growth associated,
non-growth associated, and mixed growth associated metabolites based on their
production during log or stationary phases of cell growth. The kinetics of rate of
product formation (rp), in batch culture was described by Leudeking–Piret model
and was given as follows: 5 rp=dpdt=αrx+βx where α––growth associated term; β––non-growth associated term.

The bio-product formation associated with exponential growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modeled as 6 rp=dpdt=αrx 

A mixed growth associated product formation was modeled by the Eq.
(8), and the product produced during
stationary phase was modeled as follows: 7 rp=dpdt=βx 

The above equation is rearranged to calculate α and β by plotting a graph
between rp/x and rx/x.

The product yield on biomass growth, 8 YP/X=X-X0P-P0. 

Results
In the present study, the screening of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa 2297 was carried out using oil collapse and oil spreading
techniques. It gave positive results for both oil collapse and oil spreading tests.
The emulsification activities of the biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2297 from different fermentation
substrates and synthetic surfactants were tested with diesel, petrol, olive oil, and
groundnut oil. When petrol and olive oil tested, maximum emulsification activity of
72.25 ± 2.47 and 59.23 ± 0.19 % was shown by biosurfactant produced from groundnut
husk and coconut oil, respectively, used as a substrate and was comparable to all
synthetic surfactants (Fig. 1). In diesel
and groundnut oil, the synthetic surfactants (SDS) had the highest activity of
70.41 ± 0.56 and 62.31 ± 0.28 %, respectively, compared to all biosurfactants
(Fig. 1). From the quantification
experiment, the highest biosurfactant production was observed in sawdust with
4.53 ± 0.03 mg/ml (Fig. 2) followed by
groundnut husk and glycerol as substrates.Fig. 1 Emulsification activity of different carbon and renewable sources
from P. aeruginosa. *Values are
represented as mean ±SD

Fig. 2 Rhamnose equivalents of different carbon and renewable sources

The biomass concentration on sawdust was used in the calculation of specific
growth rate, and it was obtained as 1.12 day−1, which
would describe the most of the data. The lower value of specific growth rate
(0.04 h−1) was observed on cheap substrate (sawdust).
The variation in experimental and predicted specific growth rate with time was
depicted in Fig. 3. Higher value of
F(11.14) and a very low value of P (<0.01) indicate that the logistic equation was the
best-fit growth model for the Pseudomonas
aeruginosa 2297 growth on sawdust consumption (Supplementary
Table 1).Fig. 3 Comparison of experimental and predicted specific growth rate of
P. aeruginosa




Based on the data obtained on the biomass and biosurfactant concentrations, the
growth rate (rx) and product formation (rp) were calculated. The value of β was obtained as 0.186 with the negligible α which was an indication of the bio-product was non-growth associated
product. From the above results, it was noticed that the more amount of product was
formed during the stationary phase of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa 2297. The comparison of experimental and predicted rate of
biosurfactant production was depicted (Fig. 4). The estimated value of product yield on biomass growth
(Yp/x) was 1.02 g/g. The significance of model was verified with analysis of
variance given in Supplementary Table 2. The higher value of F(13.19) and a very low value of P
(<0.001) indicated the best fit of model to the experimental data.Fig. 4 Comparison of experimental and predicted rate of rhamnolipid
formation (r
p) of P. aeruginosa




In PBD approach, six parameters including carbon sources (groundnut oil and
glycerol), renewable sources (groundnut husk and sawdust), and other factors (pH and
inoculum level) were screened for biosurfactant production in 12 combinations with
two test levels, and experiments were performed according to design matrix detailed
in Table 1). From the PBD surface tension
results, main effects were calculated at a confidence level of 95 % and are
summarized in Table 2. Box–Behnken design
(BBD) was adopted to optimize the levels of three identified substrates. The
individual and interactive effects were noticed at three levels (−1, 0, and +1) of
variables, and detailed design was given in Table 3. The response surface plot was represented as 3D plot with axes
pH, sawdust, and glycerol at three levels of −1, 0, and 1 (Fig. 5). The contour plots depicted interactions of two
variables with fixed value of variable at its control level (Fig. 6). The outcomes of Table 3 revealed that the factors X1, X2, and X12 (*P < 0.05) were significant, but the
remaining terms were not significant (Supplementary Table 3). Computed F value (22.89) and P < 0.001 was an indication of fitness of polynomial model
(Table 4).Table 2 Identification of significant substrates using PBD

Discussion
Selection of oil collapse and oil spreading methods was due to their strong
advantages including simplicity, low cost, quick implementation, and use of
relatively common equipment that is accessible in almost every microbiological
laboratory. However, as expected, these methods are not perfect or flawless. The
drop collapse method depends on the principle that a drop of liquid containing a
biosurfactant collapses and spreads over the oily surface. There is a direct
relationship between the diameter of the sample and concentration of the
biosurfactant, and in contrast, the drop lacking biosurfactant remains beaded due to
the hydrophobicity of the oil surface that cause aggregation of droplets (Youssef et
al. 2004); Bodour and Miller-Maier
1998; Christofi and Ivshina
2002; Bodour et al. 2003; Tugrul and Cansunar 2005; Krepsky et al. 2007), but this method is not sensitive in
detecting low levels of biosurfactant production. The emulsification index range of
7.8–63.3 % EA from biosurfactant was reported on kerosene (Techaosi et al.
2007). In Rhodococcus strain, emulsification activity of 63 % was reported using
sunflower frying oil as substrate (Sadouk et al. 2008).

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2297 was
extensively utilizes the renewable sources. During the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it produces surface-active
compounds, which were measured as rhamnose equivalents (RE). Similar type of result
was reported by Pseudomonas strain (Deziel et al.
1996). Biosurfactant production, like
cell growth, depends on the availability of the substrate. Agro-industrial wastes
are considered as the promising substrate for biosurfactant production and can
alleviate many processing industrial waste management problems (Makkar et al.
2011). In the present TLC studies, we
found that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa have shown
two spots, which resembles the presence of two types of biosurfactants produced by
used organisms, and similar results were observed by Koch et al. (1991) and Matsufuji et al. (1997) with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.

According to Sastoque-Cala et al. (2010), the specific rate of 0.109 h−1
was obtained by using MMS broth from Pseudomonas
fluorescence. Regarding the production rate, the Leudeking and Piret
model was used to describe this parameter, as it is versatile for fitting product
formation data obtained from several fermentation processes (Bailey and Ollis
1986). According to the Rashedi et al.
(2005), the maximum yield of
rhamnolipid (Yp/x) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
0.21 g/g.

A suitable medium was also formulated through statistical optimization
methodology since it has various advantages of being rapid and reliable in short
listing of nutrients at varying concentrations leading to significant reduction in
the total number of experiments. Two sequential steps of statistical approach such
as Plackett–Burman design (PBD) and response surface methodology (RSM) were
performed to design the optimized production medium for biosurfactant from Pseudomonasaeruginosa.

When additional factors are to be investigated, Plackett–Burman method may be
adopted to find the variables influencing the metabolite production (Plackett and
Burman 1944). This technique allows for
the evaluation of ‘n − 1’ variables in ‘n’ experiments at high and low levels, and ‘n’ must be the multiple of 4. Each row in the design
matrix represents one experimental run, and each column represents the high and low
values of one factor. It requires that the frequency of each level of a variable in
a given column should be equal. Once the data are obtained for each trial,
statistical analysis can be performed to evaluate and rank factors by their degree
of impact on the fermentation process. This ranking begins with the calculation of
main effect and probability value of each factor. The main effect of the factor
refers to the change in response over the entire range (−1 to +1).

For a variable X, 9 Main effect=∑X(H)nn22-∑X(L)nn22 where Σ X(H): sum of high values of variable ‘X’ in one experimental run Σ X(L): sum of low values of variable
‘X’ in one experimental run n: number of experimental runs

 Software programs such as Microsoft Excel and MATLAB are used to calculate the
main effects and P (probability) values of
variables. A large estimate, either positive or negative, indicates that a factor
has a large impact on metabolite productivity, while an estimate close to zero means
that a factor has little or no effect. Generally, probability value <0.01 for a
factor is considered as significant factor for the response of fermentation.

This statistical design is described by a first-order linear model as
follows: 10 YS=β0+∑i=1nβiXi YS: surface tension, βi: linear coefficients, Xi: factors.

The confidence level of components below 95 % in biosurfactant production was
considered insignificant. Here, positive effect means reduction in surface tension,
and negative effect means increase in surface tension. Hence, the effect for each
component was considered as opposite from calculated values, i.e., lower surface
tension means positive effect, and higher value means negative effect.

Of the tested variables, the positive effects on biosurfactant production have
shown by sawdust, groundnut oil, and glycerol, while the negative impacts had given
by pH, inoculums size, and groundnut husk. Initial pH of fermentation medium has got
the highest impact on the surface tension. Significance of the present experimental
could be validated through analysis of variance (P value <0.001). Proposed linear model was as follows:  11 Ys=56.841+0.908X1-0.908X2+0.175X3+0.558X4-12.802X5-2.358X6 

Based on the main effects pH, sawdust and glycerol have profound effect on the
biosurfactant production, and the exact optimal values of the individual factors are
still unknown but can be optimized by RSM.

RSM is the process of adjusting variables toward the optimum response of
fermentation. A second-order polynomial equation, fitted to data by multiple
regression procedure, resulted in quadratic model, and it was given by
Eq. 1. 1 Y=β0+β1X1+β2X2+β3X3+β12X1X2+β13X1X3+β23X2X3+β11X12+β22X22+β33X32 where Y––predicted response of
fermentation X1, X2 and X3 are the coded settings for three factors β0––value of fitted response at the center point of the design
β1, β2, and β3––linear coefficients β12, β13, and β23––interaction coefficients β11, β22, and β33––quadratic coefficients.

 An optimum combination of variables (pH: 7.37, sawdust: 7.656 g, and glycerol:
1.5 ml) was achieved through predicted plot of full quadratic model with surface
tension of 70 ± 40 mN/m. To confirm the coefficients of second-order polynomial
model by regression coefficient and analysis of variance (ANOVA), biosurfactant
production was performed and the proposed model was written as follows: 12 Y=62.3+31.6X1-8.425X2+0.2X3-2.6X1X2+0.65X2X3-26.8X12-3.45X22-4.35X32 

Results obtained from Table 3
illustrated that the factors X1, X2, and X12 (*P < 0.05) were significant and the
rest were not significant (Supplementary Table 3). Computed F value (22.89) and P < 0.001
was an indication of fitness of polynomial model (Table 4). The multiple correlation coefficient (R2) was calculated as 97.63 %. This indicates that the
second-order polynomial model could explain 97.63 % of variability in the response,
and only 2.37 % of the total variations were not explained by the model. The
adjusted R2 (93.36 %) and predicted R2 (97.63 %) were suggesting a high significance model
used for analyzing the data.

Abalos et al. (2002) reported the
utilization of response surface methodology to optimize the culture media for the
production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa AT10. Similarly, Joshi et al. (2007) also reported the statistical optimization
of medium components for the production of biosurfactant by Bacillus licheniformis K51. According to Joshi et al. (2007), Plackett–Burman and Box–Behnken designs are
very effective statistical tools to improving biosurfactant production.

Conclusion
In the present study, P. aeruginosa 2297 has
showed good screening, emulsification, and surface-active properties. In the initial
screening optimum process for carbon and renewable sources, sawdust, groundnut husk,
groundnut, and glycerol were the best optimized substrates for biosurfactant
production. The logistic equation and Leudeking–Piret models would fit to the growth
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on sawdust consumption
and biosurfactant production. The statistical analysis of coefficient in
Plackett–Burman design experiments demonstrates that pH, sawdust, and glycerol
showed profound effect on the biosurfactant production. Optimization of these three
selected variables while keeping the rest of the factors at their low levels through
a Box–Behnken design shows maximum predicted biosurfactant production using pH:
7.37, sawdust: 7.656 g, and glycerol: 1.5 ml.
