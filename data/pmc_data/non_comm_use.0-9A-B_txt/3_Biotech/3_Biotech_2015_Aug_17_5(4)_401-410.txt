production of biofuels. Here we examined the impact of overexpressing the
heterologous groESL chaperone from Clostridium acetobutylicum to enhance the tolerance of
Escherichia coli against several stressors.
Strain tolerance was identified using strain maximum specific growth rate (μ) and strain growth after a period of solvent exposure.
In comparison with control strain, the groESL
overexpressing strain yielded a 27 % increase in growth under 0.8 % (v/v) butanol, a
9 % increase under 1 % (v/v) butanol, and a 64 % increase under 1.75 (g/l) acetate.
Moreover, after 10 h, groESL overexpression
resulted in increase in relative tolerance of 58 % compared with control strain
under 0.8 % (v/v) butanol, 56 % increase under 1 % (v/v) butanol, 42 % increase
under 1 % (v/v) isobutanol, 36 % increase under 4 % (v/v) ethanol, 58 % increase
under 1.75 (g/l) acetate. These data demonstrate that overexpression of the
groESL from C.
acetobutylicum in E. coli increased
tolerance to several stressors. Solvent tolerant strain of E. coli was developed to be used as a basic strain for biofuel
production.

Introduction
Concerns about the global energy crisis, coupled with increased awareness of
global warming, have spurred an interest in developing alternatives to fossil fuels.
Due to their renewable features, biofuels are potential candidates for partially, or
completely, replacing crude oil. Presently, ethanol fermented from starch or sugar
is the most widely used biofuel due to the ease of manufacturing it from
agricultural feedstock. Meanwhile, there is increasing interest in butanol as an
advanced alternative biofuel with several distinctive advantages over ethanol based
on a number of attractive attributes, including its higher energy density,
miscibility with gasoline, higher octane rating, lower volatility, lower vapor
pressure, less corrosive and less water solubility (Connor and Liao 2009). Typically, biobutanol can be produced by
acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE) fermentation using anaerobic bacteria, i.e.
Clostridia.

The toxic nature of solvents on bacteria is a major limiting factor in the
production of chemicals by fermentation (Isken and de Bont 1998). Accumulation of organic solvents has been
shown to permeabilize the cell membrane, resulting in a passive flux of ATP,
protons, ions, and macromolecules such as RNA and proteins (Sikkema et al.
1995). Solvents may also disrupt the
function of embedded membrane proteins and drastically alter membrane fluidity
(Bowles and Ellefson 1985; Sikkema et
al. 1994). Growth has been shown to be
the most sensitive cellular activity to the effects of solvents (Ingram 1990).

Butanol toxicity/inhibition to the fermenting microorganisms is one of the major
barriers currently facing the production of biobutanol. Even the native producer,
Clostridium acetobutylicum, only tolerates up
to 1–2 % (v/v) of this organic solvent (Winkler et al. 2010), resulting in a low butanol titer in the
fermentation broth. The toxicity of butanol in C.
acetobutylicum is quite severe, and this has been attributed to its
chaotropic effect on the cell membrane (Bowles and Ellefson 1985; Vollherbst-Schneck et al. 1984). High concentrations of butanol have
inhibition effects on nutrient transport, membrane-bound ATPase activity and glucose
uptake (Bowles and Ellefson 1985).
C. acetobutylicum fermentations rarely produce
butanol higher than 13 g/L, a level that is inhibitory for the growth of C. acetobutylicum and is generally considered as the
toxic limit (Jones and Woods 1986).
Butanol is the most toxic produced solvent to C.
acetobutylicum as it reduces cell growth by 50 % at a concentration of
7–13 g/L (Tomas et al. 2003; Lee et al.
2008). Economic analysis of butanol
fermentation indicates that even a slight increase of the n-butanol concentration in the fermentation broth would reduce
separation costs and leads to an economically viable process (Papoutsakis
2008), dictating the scientific
community to engineer microbes for increased butanol tolerance.

Although C. acetobutylicum has been used as a
natural butanol producer for decades, it has several drawbacks, such as a slow
growth rate, complex regulatory pathways, and difficulties in genetic manipulation
(Jeong and Han 2010). In response to
this, Escherichia coli has been metabolically
engineered as an alternative host for butanol production by introducing a butanol
production pathway (Atsumi et al. 2008a;
Nielsen et al. 2009), due to its
well-characterized genetic background and well-developed genetic tools, allowing for
a flexible and economical process design for large-scale production. In order for
this microorganism to produce biobutanol viably, it must be able to survive under
certain concentration of this biofuel. Unfortunately, E.
coli growth is severely inhibited by butanol, being almost completely
stopped by 1 % (v/v) butanol (Atsumi et al. 2008b). This lack of butanol tolerance of E. coli has spurred research on the development of E. coli strains with improved butanol tolerance.

Most organisms with demonstrated ability to tolerate otherwise toxic solvent
levels have cellular adaptations which effectively suppress solvent effects on the
membrane through changes in membrane composition (Isken and de Bont 1998). Another class of solvent-tolerant bacteria
includes those with an efflux system, which actively decreases the concentration of
toxic solvents within the cell (Ramos et al. 2002). A third mechanism, similar to that of antibiotic resistance,
is degradation of the toxic substance to a less toxic product (Ferrante et al.
1995). Finally, toxic solvents have
been shown to induce known stress (heat shock) proteins (HSPs). The ubiquitous heat
shock proteins, also called molecular chaperones, the primary members of the general
stress response system, play an essential role in the folding and transport of
proteins, as well as remediation of damaged or misfolded proteins (Zingaro and
Papoutsakis 2012a). Solventogenic phase
and butanol-stressed clostridia express stress genes, including all major chaperones
(Alsaker and Papoutsakis 2005).

The first aim of this study was to characterize the physiological response of
E. coli to exogenous n-butanol, isobutanol, ethanol, and acetate stressors. Based upon the
previous work in C. acetobutylicum, whereby
groESL overexpression provided tolerance to
butanol stress, the second aim was to evaluate the potential influence of
heterologous overexpression in E. coli with heat
shock protein (groESL) from C. acetobutylicum to exogenous n-butanol and other stressors. The last aim was to develop butanol
tolerant strain of E. coli to render it more
suitable, and can be used as a basic strain for butanol production.

Materials and methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids
The C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and the
E. coli DH10β and BL21 strains were used in
this study. pGEM®-T Easy and pF1A T7 Flexi vectors
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were used for cloning and overexpression
studies.

Growth conditions and maintenance
C. acetobutylicum strain was grown in an
anaerobic chamber (Forma Scientific, Marietta, OH, USA) at 37 °C in clostridia
growth medium (CGM). Single colony, at least 5 days old, was obtained from
agar-solidified medium (Lab M, UK) and used to inoculate liquid culture for growth
at 37 °C. E. coli strains were grown
aerobically in liquid Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at 10 RCF (New Brunswick
Scientific, NJ, USA) and 37 °C, and on agar-solidified LB at 37 °C. When required,
the medium was supplemented with the antibiotic: ampicillin at 100 mg/ml. Frozen
stocks were prepared from overnight cultures and stored in LB plus 17.5 % glycerol
at −80 °C. Cells from a single colony were used to inoculate liquid cultures.
Growth curves were carried out in M9 minimal media supplemented with 5 g/L of
glucose, supplemented with ampicillin.

Sequence adjustment
Sequences of bacterial co-chaperonin groES
and chaperonin groEL genes from C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and E. coli were obtained from the NCBI non-redundant and dbEST data
sets using BLASTP (ver. 2.2.28+) (Altschul et al. 1997). The full amino acid sequences of the proteins were
compositionally adjusted using compositional score matrix adjustment.

DNA isolation and transformation
Isolation of genomic DNA from C.
acetobutylicum ATCC 824 strain was performed using the
Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Madison, USA,
USA). Transformations were carried out with DH10β chemically competent cells for
cloning construct and electroporation was used in expression constructs in BL21
electro-competent cells.

Gene cloning and sequence analysis
Oligonucleotide primers “Cac-groESL-F and Cac-groESL-R” with the sequences of
5′-GCCAAAATTAAGTTTATACTAAAAG-3′ and 5′-AATGCACTCTTATTACATTAATC-3′ respectively
(Tomas et al. 2003), were used to
amplify groESL operon. The groESL operon was PCR amplified using the primers
Cac-groESL-F and Cac-groESL-R with the C.
acetobutylicum chromosomal DNA as a template. The product was then
cloned into a linearized pGEMTeasy vector and chemically transformed into DH10β
competent cells. Isolation of plasmid DNA from E.
coli was performed using the Zyppy™ Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Zymo, USA).
The recombinant clone was sequenced using a Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS
Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). A homology search
was performed using BLASTN against the NCBI nucleotide database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).

Plasmid construction
The plasmid pCac-groESL was designed to overexpress the C. acetobutylicumgroES and groEL genes forming groESL operon
under T7 regulatory elements (promoter). According to the direction of the
groESL operon in pGEMTeasy vector and the
restriction sites in pGEMTeasy and pF1A T7 Flexi vectors, the groESL was double digested from pGEMTeasy vector using
SpeI and SphI and ligated into pF1A T7 Flexi vector digested with the same
restriction enzymes as shown in Fig. 1.
This plasmid was then transformed into BL21 electro-competent cell for gene
expression (Transformed strain). Oligonucleotide primers “Flexi-F and Flexi-R”
with the sequences of 5′-AGGGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAA-3′ and 5′-CTCAGCTTCCTTTCGGGCTT-3′,
respectively, were designed using Primer3 and BLAST. The recombinant clone was
sequenced using Flexi primers to confirm the direction of the groESL operon. For control strain, the pF1A T7 Flexi
vector was double digested using SpeI and
SphI, converted to blunt-ends DNA using T4
DNA polymerase and self-ligated to eliminate Barnase lethal gene and forming pF1A
T7 Flexi (−) as shown in Fig. 1, and then
transformed into BL21 electro-competent cell.Fig. 1 Construction of pF1A T7 Flexi (−) and pgroESL. The location and
direction of relevant genes are indicated with arrows. Relevant restriction sites are shown



Butanol challenge experiment
groESL transformed strain was cultured in M9 minimal media (5 g/L glucose) and
incubated overnight at 37 °C to be used as inoculum. On the next day, a 5 % (v/v)
inoculum was used to seed a 30 mL culture in 250 mL closed-cap flasks for growth
kinetic analysis in the absence and presence of 0.8 and 1 % (v/v) n-butanol. Three biological replicas were obtained per
sample. Bacterial growth was monitored using spectrophotometry (optical density at
600 nm [OD600]) until stationary phase was reached. The growth kinetic parameter
“s” described below was calculated.
Statistical significance was assessed using a Student’s t test analysis using a p value
cut-off of 0.05. Standard deviation was used to measure the amount of
variation from the average.

Calculation of growth kinetic parameters
The growth kinetics parameters: “percentage of inhibition”, “relative fitness
coefficient (s)” and “relative increase in fitness (RIF)” were calculated using
Eqs. (1), (2) and (3), respectively
(Reyes et al. 2013). These parameters
were calculated using the measured maximum specific growth rate (µi) of each strain (strain i). 1 Inhibition(%)=1-μclone@stressful conditionμclone in absence ofstressor×100  2 s(%)=μclone @ stressful conditionμreference strain @ stressful condition-1×100  3 RIF(%)=1-Inhibitionclone @ stressful conditionInhibitionreference strain @ stressful condition×100 

Other growth kinetics parameters, “percentage of tolerance” and “relative
tolerance (RT)”, were calculated using Eqs. (4) and (5), respectively
(Borden and Papoutsakis 2007). These
parameters were calculated using the measured growth after a period of
time. 4 Tolerance(%)=A600\% challenge,t-A600\%challenge,t0A600no challenge,t-A600no challenge,t0×100  5 RT(%)=1-Toleranceclone @ stressful conditionTolerancereference strain @ stressful condition×100 

Phenotypic analysis of n-butanol-tolerance conferring groESL gene
Transformed strain that showed a statistically significant increase in
relative fitness in the presence of n-butanol
was validated in batch cultures under other stressors. The stressors analyzed in
this study were 0.8 % (v/v) n-butanol, 1 %
(v/v) n-butanol, 1 % (v/v) isobutanol, 4 %
(v/v) ethanol, 1.75 g/L of acetate. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with constant
shaking at 10 RCF.

Results and discussion
The aim of this study was to develop butanol tolerant strain of E. coli that can be used as a basic strain for butanol
production by means of overexpression of heat shock protein, groESL isolated from C.
acetobutylicum. Previous studies used groESL isolated from E. coli for
autologous overexpression and showed increasing in butanol tolerance.

Amino acids sequences producing significant alignments
Autologous overexpression of groESL in
C. acetobutylicum and E. coli were performed and increased solvent tolerance (Tomas et al.
2003; Zingaro and Papoutsakis
2012b). To determine the identities
of co-chaperonin groES and chaperonin groEL from C.
acetobutylicum ATCC 824 to co-chaperonin groES and chaperonin groEL from
E. coli, the compositional score matrix
adjustment was used to align amino acid sequence homology. The alignments showed
that the identity of groES protein from
C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and E. coli was 48 % and the identity of groEL protein from C.
acetobutylicum ATCC 824 and E.
coli was 61 % as shown in Fig. 2. The low identities in amino acid sequences increased the
possibility of a significant effect of heterologous overexpression of groESL from C.

genes



Isolation of groESL from C. acetobutylicum
Total DNA isolated from C. acetobutylicum
was used to amplify groESL operon using
specific primers. groESL specific primers were
used to amplify an operon of 2,145 bp (Fig. 3). The amplified groESL was
purified, cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector,
transformed into DH10β strain and sequenced. The sequence was confirmed by
BLASTN.Fig. 3 Amplification of groESL
operon. Lane 1. 1 kb ladder, Lane 2. groESL operon (2145 bp)



Cloning of groESL operon in pF1AT7 Flexi
vector
Both groESL operon into the pGEMT-easy
vector and pF1AT7 Flexi vector were double digested with SpeI and SphI restriction
enzymes. The restriction enzymes were selected using NEBcutter, so they do not cut
into the operon and to ensure the right orientation of the groESL operon in pF1A T7 Flexi vector. The digested groESL operon was ligated into digested pF1AT7 Flexi
vector. The groESL and control clones were
separately transformed into BL21 strain and confirmed using PCR test. The
groESL operon was sequenced using Flexi-F and
Flexi-R oligonucleotide primers.

groESL heterologous overexpression under T7
promoter imparts higher butanol tolerance to E.
coli and other stressors
E. coli strain BL21 transformed by groESL was tested to increase the tolerance of
E. coli to various stressors. E. coli strain BL21 transformed by the pF1A T7 Flexi
harboring the barnase free vector was used as control, throughout these
experiments. Both strains were challenged in the presence of 0.8 % butanol, 1 %
butanol, 1 % isobutanol, 4 % ethanol, and 1.75 g/l acetate, separately. The impact
of different stressors on cell growth was examined after 10 h of treatment. The
optical density (OD) revealed that the overexpression of groESL enabled a significant increase in growth after 10 h for all
stressors compared to the control (Fig. 4). Under solvent stress, the control strain demonstrated an
exponential growth phase much shorter than the transformed strain. Transformed
strain reached consistently higher optical densities and maintained higher cell
concentrations over the control strain for the period-examined (Fig. 4). This confirms the ability of groESL to induce tolerance in the transformed strain,
which results in prolonged exponential phase. On the other hand, the control
strain showed less tolerance to stressors by reaching the stationary phase
earlier.Fig. 4 Growth curve of control and groESL with the challenge of different
stressors



Effect of groESL overexpression on
tolerance to butanol
The kinetic parameters were calculated to determine the increase in stress
tolerance. The ratio between the specific growth rates of the strain of interest
relative to the control strain under each stress condition was determined using
the relative fitness coefficient “s” (Eq. 2, in “Materials and
methods”). The Relative Increase in Fitness, “RIF”, is a parameter
calculated to normalize the relative fitness of the overexpression strain in the
presence of the stressor against any fitness defects/advantage exhibited by the
strain in the absence of the stressor. Positive values of RIF represent a net
increase in growth rates in the presence of the stressor. A Student’s t test analysis (p
value <0.05) was used to assess significance of the aforementioned calculated
kinetic parameters. At 0.8 % butanol, a significant increase in growth was found
in the transformed strain compared to the control (Fig. 4). When grown without solvent stress, the transformed strain and
the control strain performed comparably in terms of growth. The fitness of the
transformed strain was significantly increased with relative fitness coefficient
of 44 % compared to control strain (Fig. 5) and the inhibition of this strain reduced to 47 % compared to
64 % in control strain, i.e. the transformed strain yielded 27 % growth
improvement (Fig. 6). The percent
tolerance relative to unchallenged culture was estimated at the challenge level
and sample time (Eq. 4). The relative
tolerance (% RT) of strain compared to the control strain was estimated
(Eq. 5). The percent of butanol
tolerance in the transformed strain was significantly increased to 33 % compared
to 14 % in control after 10 h of exposure to 0.8 % butanol with relative tolerance
of 58 % (Fig. 7). At 1 % butanol, a
significant increase in growth was found in the transformed strain compared to the
control (Fig. 4). The fitness of the
transformed strain was significantly increased with relative fitness coefficient
of 30 % compared to control strain (Fig. 5) and the inhibition of this strain reduced to 74 % compared to
81 % in control strain, i.e. the transformed strain yielded 9 % growth improvement
(Fig. 6). The percent of butanol
tolerance in the transformed strain was significantly increased to 8 % compared to
3.5 % in control after 10 h of exposure to 1 % butanol with relative tolerance of
56 % (Fig. 7). In agreement of these
results, Tomas et al. (2003) showed
that synthetic overexpression of groESL in
C. acetobutylicum imparts solvent tolerance
with 85 % reduction in growth inhibition and leads to prolonged and enhanced
growth, metabolism, and solvent production by up to 40 %. In addition, groESL overexpression was shown to increase tolerance
to butanol in L. paracasei and L. lactis (Desmond et al. 2004). Moreover, overexpression of the E. coligroESL proteins improved tolerance to a variety
of toxic solvents, apparently in a solvent-agnostic manner (Zingaro and
Papoutsakis 2012a). Heterologous HSPs
have also been used to improve organic solvent tolerance in E. coli (Okochi et al. 2008).Fig. 5 Relative fitness coefficient of groESL with the challenge of butanol, isobutanol, ethanol,
and acetate stressors. Error bars

Effect of groESL overexpression on
tolerance to other solvents
Cell cultures were challenged using isobutanol and ethanol, separately in the
nutrient media to evaluate the effect of groESL
overexpression on tolerance to those stressors, and all parameters were
calculated. In the presence of 1 % isobutanol, using the kinetic parameters depend
on the measured maximum specific growth rate (µi) of each strain, the fitness of the transformed strain was reduced
with relative fitness coefficient of 24 % compared to control strain
(Fig. 5) and the inhibition of this
strain increased to 65 % compared to 54 % in control strain, i.e. the control
strain yielded 20 % growth improvement (Fig. 6). However, using the kinetic parameters depend on the measured
growth after a period of time, the percent of isobutanol tolerance in the
transformed strain was significantly increased to 12 % compared to 7 % in control
after 10 h of exposure to isobutanol with relative tolerance of 42 %
(Fig. 7). Similar results were shown
with ethanol; in the presence of 4 % ethanol, using the kinetic parameters depend
on the measured maximum specific growth rate (µi) of each strain, the fitness of the transformed strain was decreased
but not significant with relative fitness coefficient of 3 % compared to control
strain (Fig. 5) and inhibition of this
strain reduced to 60 % compared to 58 % in control strain, i.e. the control strain
yielded 3 % growth improvement (Fig. 6),
while using the kinetic parameters depend on the measured growth after a period of
time, the percent of ethanol tolerance in the transformed strain was significantly
increased to 22 % compared with 14 % in control after 10 h of exposure to ethanol
with relative tolerance of 36 % (Fig. 7).
While the trend is an increase in toxicity with an increase in solvent
hydrophobicity, the mechanism of toxicity varies with the length of the carbon
backbone (Aono and Nakajima 1997;
Rutherford et al. 2010). Most
toxicity studies have proposed the cell membrane as the most affected target of
organic solvents and a significant factor in adapting to the stress. Both long-
and short-chain alcohols are known to cause stress by either desiccation (short)
or by intercalating in the hydrophobic cell wall fatty acids (long) (Ingram
1986; Ingram and Buttke,
1984; Kabelitz et al. 2003; Rutherford et al. 2010) and may be critical factors in the
robustness of a host microbe during fuel production. It was demonstrated that
Gram-negative bacteria are generally much more resistant to increasingly polar
solvents than Gram-positive prokaryotes (Inoue and Horikoshi 1991; Vermue et al. 1993). The abilities of the different alcohols
to induce the heat shock response are proportional to their lipophilicities: the
lipophilic alcohol isobutanol is maximally inductive at about 0.6 M, whereas the
least lipophilic alcohol, methanol, causes maximal induction at 5.7 M (Meyer et
al. 1995).

Effect of groESL overexpression on
tolerance to acetate
Cross-tolerance between acetate and n-butanol stress have been identified
previously in C. acetobutylicum (Nielsen et al.
2009; Alsaker et al. 2010), and thus was included as a test condition
here. The effect of acetate stressor on the cells was studied using 1.75 g/L prior
to growth assay. A significant increase in growth rate was found in the
transformed strain compared to the control strain as shown in Fig. 4. Using the kinetic parameters depend on the
measured maximum specific growth rate (µi) of each strain, The fitness of the transformed strain was
significantly increased with relative fitness coefficient of 36 % compared to
control strain (Fig. 5) and inhibition of
this strain reduced to 14 % compared to 38 % in control strain, i.e. the
transformed strain yielded 64 % growth improvement (Fig. 6), while using the kinetic parameters depend on the measured
growth after a period of time, the percent of acetate tolerance in the transformed
strain was significantly increased to 72 % compared to 30 % in control after 10 h
of exposure to acetate with relative tolerance of 58 % (Fig. 7). In agreement of this result, HSP genes were shown
to be up-regulated upon carboxylic acid (butyric and acetic) stress and groESL appears to be commonly up-regulated upon butanol
and acetate stresses (Alsaker et al. 2010).

Conclusion
Heterologous overexpression of groESL
chaperone system from C. acetobutylicum was
successfully employed on E. coli in order to
increase its tolerance to several toxic stressors. Our results show that
heterologous overexpression of groESL chaperone
is a useful and efficient approach for developing butanol tolerant strain of
E. coli to be a basic strain for butanol
production.
