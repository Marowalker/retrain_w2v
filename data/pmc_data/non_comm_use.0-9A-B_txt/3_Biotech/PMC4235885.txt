Introduction
Cellulases are a class of enzymes primarily responsible for hydrolysis of
cellulose into β-glucose. They are commonly employed in paper and pulp industry
(Buchert et al. 1996), animal feed, and
textile and detergent industry (Aygan and Arikan 2008; Sukumaran et al. 2005). They are also applied in the production of bioethanol (Wang
et al. 2009) from lignocellulosic
materials. The present enzyme toolbox is not sufficient to meet their industrial
demand (Chakraborty et al. 2009). For
this reason, exploring new and potent sources of cellulase is desirable. There are
various sources of enzymes, although microorganisms are targeted nowadays due to
their broad biochemical diversity, feasibility of mass culture, and ease of genetic
manipulation (Eichler 2001) Microbial
enzymes are believed to possess a higher degree of stability than those derived from
plants and animals. Extreme conditions, viz, temperature and pH used during some of
the industrial processes can degrade the enzyme or reduce its stability. Therefore,
new techniques and process methodologies are implicated for isolation of enzymes
exhibiting tolerance to such extreme conditions. This has propelled researchers to
target extremophiles for enzymes carrying novel properties (Herbert 1992; Gupta and Roy 2002).

Marine ecosystem is a habitat with remarkably high and diverse microbial cell
densities. Consequently, the microbial inhabitants of such environment must have
adapted their cellular machinery to thrive in the extreme conditions of temperature,
pressure, pH, salinity, etc. Earlier reports suggest their salt-tolerating capacity
of above 1.7 M (Marhuenda-Egea and Bonete 2002), hyperthermostability (80–108 °C), barophilicity (60 MPa),
cold adaptivity, and alkali stability. With increase in demand of the industrially
valuable enzymes, along with selection of their potent source, their economical
production has become a must. Improvement in fermentation conditions for maximizing
cell density and overproduction of metabolite is frequently endeavored (Mukhopadhyay
et al. 2008). But, this is a
time-consuming process and does not explain the combined interactive effect of
parameters involved with the fermentation process. To overcome these limitations,
different initiatives have been undertaken. Among these initiatives, optimization of
the process parameters affecting fermentation by statistically designed experimental
strategies is an easy and rapid process. One such method is response surface
methodology (RSM). It is a collection of experiments, mathematical methods, and
statistical inference that evaluates the combined effect of all the factors
participating in the fermentation process (Liu and Tzeng 1998; Elibol 2003). 3D plots for response surface assist visualization of the
parameter interaction in a better manner (Zambare 2011). Consequently, optimal variables can be determined that give
rise to desirable results. There are several reports on RSM-mediated optimization of
enzyme production from microorganisms (Liu and Tzeng 1998; Elibol 2003;
Zambare 2011). Hence, in the present
study we describe response surface methodology-mediated optimization of the
variables for an economical production of cellulase from marine eubacterial isolate
inhabiting saltpan soil of the coast of Bay of Bengal near Andhra Pradesh.

Materials and methods
Chemicals
Media and chemicals were purchased from Hi Media chemicals, Mumbai, India;
Merck Specialities Private Limited and Sisco Research Private Limited, Mumbai,
India, respectively.

Revival of strain Bacillus VITRKHB
(JF960957)
Microbial isolate (Bacillus VITRKHB) was
previously observed to be potent for some industrially desirable enzymes (Richa et
al. 2013). It was subjected to
further evaluation of its cellulolytic activity. It was preserved in glycerol
stock kept at −20 °C. The culture was revived on nutrient agar media incubated at
37 °C for 24 h.

Screening of the strain for cellulolytic activity
The Bacillus VITRKHB was screened for
cellulolytic activity by growing it on a carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) agar plate
for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 1 % iodine was poured on the starch agar
plates and a combination of 0.1 ml HCl + 5 ml of 1 % iodine in 2 % KI was added to
CMC agar plates. A clear zone of hydrolysis around the colony indicates a positive
result.

Production of cellulase
Enzyme production was carried out in the production media containing (g/l) CMC
(20), peptone (20), NaCl (1), CaCl2 (0.005),
MgSO4 (0.82),
K2HPO4 (1.25),
KH2PO4 (3),
FeSO4 (0.01), ZnSO4 (0.005),
MnCl2 (0.0001), and NH4Cl (1) (Wei
et al. 2011). 10 ml of bacterial
inoculum was added into 500 ml production medium and the flask was kept in a
rotary shaker incubator at room temperature for 24 h. After incubation, the
fermented broth was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min in a cooling centrifuge.
The supernatant was collected and subsequently used for the estimation of
cellulase.

Effect of different carbon sources on cellulase production and
activity
The effect of five different carbon sources, viz., sucrose, fructose, xylose,
starch, and lactose, on the production of enzymes was studied (Ashwini et al.
2011).

Effect of different nitrogen sources on cellulase production and
activity
The effect of five different nitrogen sources, viz., beef extract, yeast
extract, nutrient broth, urea, and casein, on the production of enzymes was
studied (Ashwini et al. 2011).

Optimization by response surface methodology (RSM)
In the present study, statistically designed experiments were executed to
optimize the process parameters influencing cellulase production. The five
independent variables chosen for optimization were xylose (A), beef extract (B),
pH (C), NaCl (D), and temperature (E). The total number of experiments suggested
by the model was 31. The range of medium components is shown in Table 1. Each variable was set at two levels (−1 and +1).
Trace element solution was constantly maintained (Wei et al. 2011). The experimental design was developed
using Design Expert, version 7.0.7.1.Table 1 Range of media components for RSM

	Low (−1)	High (+1)	
(A) Xylose (g)	3	7	
(B) Beef extract (g)	3	7	
(C) pH	5	8	
(D) NaCl (%)	1	4	
(E) Temperature (°C)	20	35	



Protein estimation
The concentration of protein present in the fermentation media was
investigated by Lowry’s method (Lowery et al. 1951).

Enzyme assay
The enzyme activity of cellulase was studied according to the Denison and
Koehn’s method (1977). One ml of 1 %
CMC was added to 1 ml of cellulase and the tubes were incubated at 55 °C for
15 min in a water bath. Two ml of dinitrosalicyclic acid (DNS) was added so as to
stop the reaction and the tubes were subsequently kept in a boiling water bath for
5 min. Thereafter, 1 ml of sodium potassium tartrate was added. Absorbance was
recorded at 540 nm and after cooling the tubes.

Partial purification
The RSM-optimized medium was further used for enzyme production. The crude
extract was partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation. 100 ml of this
extract was subjected to precipitation and brought to 80 % saturation by the slow
addition of ammonium sulfate and gentle stirring at 4 °C. The precipitate was
collected by centrifugation (10,000 rpm at 4 °C) and dissolved in 0.1 M Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 7.83). The precipitate was desalted by dialysis. The solution was
placed in a bag with a selectively permeable membrane (Dialysis membrane-150,
Himedia laboratories Ltd; Mumbai, India) and immersed in a large volume of 0.1 M
Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.83) in stirring condition at 4 °C for 24 h.

The enzyme solution procured after dialysis was further purified by ion
exchange chromatography. The solution was loaded on a DEAE cellulose column that
was pre-equilibrated with 10 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.83). Proteins were eluted
with 10 mM Tris–HCl and 0–2.0 M NaCl gradient. The eluted fractions (3 ml) were
collected and absorbance was measured at 280 nm. Enzyme activity and concentration
were estimated after each purification step. Furthermore, specific activity,
yield, and fold purification was also calculated.

SDS-PAGE
Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was
performed for the purified protein to determine the molecular weight according to
the method of Laemmli (1970) using a
10 % cross-linked polyacrylamide gel. The molecular weight was determined using
Sigma wide range molecular weight marker (range 10–180 kDa).

Brine shrimp bioassay: a hatchability test
Brine shrimp hatchability test was performed according to a method by Migliore
et al. (1997). The brine shrimp
(Artemia salina) eggs or cysts were hatched
in sterile seawater (1 g cyst/l) at 28 °C, under conditions of continuous lighting
and strong aeration. Different concentrations of marine actinobacteria extract
(250, 500, 750, 1,000 μg/ml) were added along with the eggs. The number of free
nauplii was calculated after each
treatment.

Results and discussion
Screening of Bacillus VITRKHB for
cellulolytic activity
A clear zone of hydrolysis (15.2 mm) observed on the CMC agar plate showed
cellulolytic activity of this Bacillus VITRKHB.
Several reports have described cellulase production from this particular genus
isolated from terrestrial (Das et al. 2010; Aboul-Enein et al. 2010; Verma et al. 2012) as well as marine sources (Bhat and Bhat 1997; Mohapatra et al. 2003; Taylor et al. 2006).

Effect of different carbon sources on cellulase production
Enzyme production and enzyme activity were found to be maximum when xylose was
used as the carbon source (Fig. 1).
Production was very low in the fermentation media containing starch. Carbon source
and its pretreatment are the major cost-contributing factor for commercial enzyme
production (Marsden and Gray 1986). A
study on cellulase production by Bacillus sp.
from terrestrial sources described cellulose as the best carbon source (Wei et al.
2011), while xylan proved to be the
best carbon source for cellulase production from Bacillus
cereus MRK1 (Mukesh Kumar et al. 2012). Sucrose gave the best result as compared to others during
cellulase production from Trichoderma viride
(Gautam et al. 2010). Lactose was
used as the carbon source during mesophilic alkaline cellulase production from
marine bacterium Marinobacter sp. MSI032
(Shanmughapriya et al. 2010). These
studies suggest that cellulose is the significant carbon source for cellulase
production from Bacillus sp. isolated from
terrestrial sources. However, our study confirms that disaccharides and
monosaccharides such as sucrose and xylose are better carbon supplements for
cellulase production from marine source.Fig. 1 Effect of carbon sources on enzyme activity and protein
content




Effect of different nitrogen sources on cellulase production
Cellulase yield was maximum with yeast extract used as nitrogen source,
although activity was maximum when beef extract was used (Fig. 2). This is in accordance with a report on cellulase
production by B. cereus (Mukesh Kumar et al.
2012) that suggested yeast extract
to be the best nitrogen source for cellulase production. However, a report also
showed peptone as the best nitrogen source for cellulase production (Marsden and
Gray 1986). Likewise, another report
suggested yeast extract as nitrogen source for cellulase production from T. viride (Gautam et al. 2010). Peptone and casein were also reported as nitrogen sources
for cellulase production from sponge-associated marine bacterium Marinobacter sp. MSI032 (Shanmughapriya et al.
2010). These studies suggest that
yeast extract and peptone may be preferred for better cellulase production.
However, our study suggests beef extract to be the appropriate nitrogen source for
desirable enzyme activity.Fig. 2 Effect of nitrogen sources on enzyme activity and protein
content




Optimization using response surface methodology (RSM)
Investigation of the mutual interactive effect of the independent variables,
viz., xylose (A), beef extract (B), pH (C), NaCl (D), and temperature (E), on the
production of cellulase from Bacillus VITRKHB
was carried out and the optimal level of each variable was attained. An experiment
with 31 runs was designed and performed with an incubation period of 24 h. ANOVA
was carried out using a response surface quadratic model that gave the following
equation: R1=+1.6+0.011×A+1.751E-003×B-1.023E-004×C+1.167E-003×D+0.014×E-2.002E-003×A×B+8.409E-003×A×C+7.338E-004×A×D+3.562E-003×A×E-0.013×B×C+7.107E-3×B×D+0.010×B×E-4.363E-003×C×D-9.507E-004×C×E+0.020×D×E 


The outcome of ANOVA analysis was recorded. The F value was 1.44 and there was a 24.35 % chance that a “model
F value” this large could occur due to noise.
Values of “prob > F” <0.0500 indicated
that the model terms were significant. DE was a significant model term of this
analysis. Values >0.1000 indicate that the model terms are not significant. The
“lack of fit F value” of 2.43 implied that lack
of fit was not significant relative to the pure error. There was a 16.97 % chance
that a “lack of fit F value” this large could
occur due to noise. Non-significant lack of fit was good. In this study, all the
linear, interactive effects of AB, AC, AD, AE, DE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, and DE were
good for enzyme activity. The coefficient of determination (R2) for enzyme activity was calculated as 0.5905. The
interactive effects of independent variables on enzyme were studied by plotting 3D
surface curves. The 3D curves of the calculated enzyme activity for the
interactions between the variables are shown in Fig. 3. The optimal levels of the significant variables for the
maximum amylase production were: xylose 5 %, beef extract 6.90 %, pH 7.83, NaCl
1.17 %, and temperature 25.84 °C.Fig. 3 Effects of a beef extract and

Reduction in the production cost of cellulase by optimization of growth
conditions and the process is one of the major targets of cellulase research
(Sukumaran et al. 2005) Optimization
of fermentation parameters for the development of economically feasible
bioprocesses has been a challenge (Hao et al. 2006). Effective experimental designs may lead to the development
of the optimum process. The experimental designs developed by the combination of
statistics and mathematics have played a significant role in the field of
industrial biotechnology. Response surface methodology is one such method that
employs statistical techniques for designing experiments, building models,
evaluating combined interactive effect of different independent variables, and
determining the optimum conditions. Performing statistically designed experiments,
filling experimentally determined response data into a quadratic model, predicting
response, and checking the significance of the model are the major steps of this
process (Vohra and Satyanarayana 2002). RSM eases the process of optimization as it involves rapid
screening of the optimal condition with lesser consumption of material and effort.
Satisfactory optimization of microbial enzyme production becomes possible with the
implication of the 3D plots for response surface which allows direct visualization
of parameter interaction (Mullai et al. 2010). Earlier, RSM-mediated optimization was applied for the
evaluation of the combined interactive effect of wheat bran, Avicel, soybean cake
flour, and corn steep flour in the production of cellulase from mutant strain
T. reesei WX-112. An increase in cellulase
activity was observed (Mullai et al. 2010). Central composite design-based RSM was also used for
optimizing the level of lignocelluloses and lactose for maximum cellulase
production from agricultural waste (Muthuvelayudham and Viruthagiri 2010). Another study reports optimization of
media composition (palm oil mill effluent as basal media) from T. reesei RUT-C30 using face-centered central composite
design under RSM (Rashid et al. 2009). According to these reports, RSM-mediated optimization of
cellulase production results in enhanced enzyme yield and activity as compared to
the classical method of optimization. Hence, in the present study, we endeavored
to apply RSM to examine the effect of combined interaction of different variables,
starch, yeast extract, pH, NaCl, and temperature on the production of cellulase.
This technique was found to be efficient for the rapid optimization of the process
parameters for cellulase production in our study. After optimization, production
of cellulase from marine Bacillus VITRKHB was
found to be economical, with an increased enzyme yield and activity.

Partial purification of enzyme
RSM-optimized medium was further employed for the production of cellulase.
Thereafter, the crude extract was subjected to purification steps. Total protein,
enzyme activity, specific activity, and fold purification were calculated
(Table 2). The enzyme was purified to
1.30-fold with specific activity of 1.60 U/mg after ammonium sulfate
precipitation. It increased to 1.60 U/mg after dialysis with a fold purification
of ~1.55. The dialyzed enzyme was subjected to DEAE ion exchange chromatography.
The fold purification increased to 1.90 and specific activity was found to be
1.962. The enzyme yield after ion exchange chromatography was 41.3 %, which was
quite high. 1.6-fold purification was attained after ion exchange
chromatography.Table 2 Purification of crude extract for cellulase isolated from
Bacillus VITRKHB

Trivedi et al. (2011) reported a
yield of 25.03 % with a purification of 22.31-fold during alkali halotolerant
cellulase production from marine bacterium B.
flexus isolated from Ulva lactuca.
Likewise, a study showed 25.10 % recovery by using DEAE cellulose and Sephadex
G-200 columns for purification of themoactive cellulase from thermophilic
Actinomycetes (Verma et al. 2012). These previously published reports
indicate a minimum loss of enzyme after each purification step and the
effectiveness of the purification method applied in this study. The elution
pattern of the enzyme and a broad active peak were achieved when the dialyzed
sample was passed through a DEAE cellulose column with 0.1 M Tris–HCI buffer with
Nacl (pH 7.83). The fourth peak contained the highest protein concentration
(0.80 mg/ml) (Fig. 4).Fig. 4 Purification of cellulase using DEAE cellulose
column




SDS-PAGE
The molecular weight of purified protein was found to be 33 kDa by SDS-PAGE
(Fig. 5). The molecular weight was
similar to that of some of the other low molecular weight (25–45 kDa)
endoglucanases produced by Bacillus spp.
(Mawadza et al. 2000; Yin Li et al.
2010; Saha 2004; Lucas et al. 2001; Aa et al. 1994).Fig. 5 SDS-PAGE of purified cellulase from Bacillus VITRKHB




Brine shrimp hatchability test

Artemia embryos were exposed to isolated marine
eubacterial cellulase and the percentage of toxicity was checked at 12 and 24 h of
exposure. There was no significant change in the hatchability of Artemia embryos observed up to 1,000 μg. Artemia embryos are highly sensitive to toxins at the
early developmental stages. The cellulase extract isolated from marine Bacillus VITRKHB did not show any toxicity when
subjected to this preliminary toxicity test. Hence, it can be considered as safe
for use as food additives in animal feed and also in textiles and
detergents.

Conclusion
Cellulase finds a wide range of application in research and development and in
the industrial sector. It is mainly employed in animal feed, textiles, detergent
industry, and fuel production from biomass. With increase in demand, its higher
yield, novel activity, and economical production are desirable. This study reports
optimized production and purification of cellulase from marine Bacillus VITRKHB. Cellulase was produced and partially
purified stepwise by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, dialysis, and
DEAE ion exchange chromatography to 1.6-fold and its specific activity was found to
be 1.92 IU/mg. The molecular weight of purified protein was found to be 33 kDa by
SDS-PAGE. The highest enzyme activity was observed in the media containing xylose as
carbon source and beef extract as nitrogen source during this study. Response
surface methodology-mediated media optimization was carried out for visualizing the
combined interactive effects of different variables, i.e., xylose 5.0 %, beef
extract 6.9 %, pH 7.83, NaCl 1.17, and temperature 25.84 °C on enzyme activity at
24 h of incubation. The brine shrimp hatchability test indicated non-toxicity of our
enzyme. Hence, the strain Bacillus VITRKHB used
in this study is potent for cellulase production and the parameters optimized are
suitable for the economic production of this enzyme. In addition to this, the enzyme
isolated during this study displays good industrial efficacy.
