sources on lipid production potential, all microalgae species were also cultured in
selected medium (BG-11) with different organic carbon sources like glucose,
glycerol, sodium acetate, and sucrose under mixotrophic condition. The results
showed that all Chlorella species performs better
under mixotrophic condition, but Chlorella
vulgaris achieved maximum lipid productivity (3.5 folds higher) in
glycerol supplemented culture medium than control medium among all species.

Introduction
Current research scenario has been focused on sustainable and
renewable biofuels due to depletion of world crude oil reserves and hike in fossil
fuels prices (Williams et al. 2009;
Sajid et al. 2016). Among various
sources of renewable energy, microalgae are getting more attention as liquid
(biodiesel and bioethanol) and gaseous (biogas and hydrogen) sources of renewable
fuels (Prajapati et al. 2014).
Microalgae has various advantages over other sources, such as having high lipid
productivity, devoid of any seasonal changes, less water and land requirement and
greater photosynthetic efficiency, which make it more sustainable. Besides
autotrophic growth, microalgae also grow well on various cheap carbon sources such
as wastewater (Prajapati et al. 2013),
in hetrotrophic mode.

Cultivation condition of microalgae affects both the biomass and lipid
productivity along with cost-effectiveness. The composition of nutrient media
(Nitrogen, carbon, phosphorus and trace metals) is one of the most significant
factors that affect growth parameter and biochemical composition of microalgae (Lam
and Lee 2012; Li et al. 2012; Prathima Devi et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2014; Lin and Wu 2015). The effect of different media composition (Allen medium,
Bold’s Basal Medium, BG-11 medium, F–Si medium, SK medium, Walne’s medium) on growth
rate and lipid accumulation of C. pyrenoidosa was
studied by Wang et al. (2014) and found
F–Si medium is the best and most economical medium for C.
pyrenoidosa under outdoor conditions (Wang et al. 2014). Huerlimann et al. cultured Isochrysis sp., Nannochloropsis sp., Tetraselmis
sp., and Rhodomonas sp. microalgae species in
three growth medium (L1, f/2, and K-medium) to study the differences in biomass
yield, lipid content and lipid productivity. Hence, it is necessitated to
investigate and select suitable medium and nutrient level for the cultivation of
microalgae with rapid growth and higher lipid content (Huerlimann et al.
2010). In addition, it was also
reported that biomass and lipid production of microalgae is also greatly affected by
different carbon sources and concentration (Cheirsilp and Torpee 2012; Lam and Lee 2012; Gim et al. 2014;
Choi and Yu 2015). The mixotrophic
cultivation, using both organic and inorganic (CO2) carbon
sources in presence of light, is a good strategy to obtain large biomass and higher
lipid content (Gao et al. 2010;
Bhatnagar et al. 2011; Choi and Yu
2015; Lin and Wu 2015).

The aim of this study is to select and modify growth medium for
enhancing biomass and lipid production of Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Chlorella sp. 1 and Chlorella sp. 2
towards biodiesel production. First, to identify suitable medium, all Chlorella species were grown in BG-11, BBM, Fogg’s medium
and M4N. Then, to study the effect of different carbon
sources (Fructose, Glycerol, Glucose and Sodium acetate) on growth and lipid
content, all the five Chlorella species were
cultivated in BG-11 nutrient medium under mixotrophic condition.

Material and methodology
Microalgae strain and pre-cultivation conditions
Pure cultures of Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Chlorella sp. 2 were
procured from Vivekananda Institute of Algal Technology (VIAT), Chennai (India);
Centre for Conservation and Utilization of Blue Green Algae, IARI New Delhi
(India), National Collection of Industrial Microorganisms (NCIM), National
Chemical Laboratory, Pune (India) and Yogi Vemana University, Vemanapuram, Kadapa,
Andhra Pradesh, India, respectively. A microalgal species was also collected from
a pond nearby the area of Dehradun, Uttarakhand and purified at agar plates by
standard protocol (Guillard 2005). It
was identified morphologically as Chlorella sp.
and is represented here as “Chlorella sp.
1”, whereas algae procured from Yogi Vemana
University, Vemanapuram, Kadapa, Andhra Pradesh, is represented as “Chlorella sp. 2” in this study. The stock cultures of
all the strains were maintained regularly on agar slants using sterilized BBM
medium (with initial pH of 6.8) under laboratory conditions at 24 °C (±1 °C) under
(~2500 lx) light intensity and 16/8 light dark cycle. All the strains were
transferred from agar slant into a liquid medium and incubated under the same
conditions of temperature and light in photobioreactor. Liquid cultures were used
as the inoculum for the designed experiments. The morphology of pure strains was
regularly examined under an optical microscope and photographed by a Nikon Eclipse
Ci-E microscope (serial no. 59E05).

Screening and identification of efficient growth media for maximum lipid
productivity
The growth performance and lipid productivity of microalgae is
highly influenced by the composition of medium used for cultivation. Four media
that have been used for photoautotrophic culture of Chlorella species include Bold’s basal medium (BBM), BG-11, Fog’s
medium and M4N.

All the Chlorella species were
cultured in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 125 ml liquid using above four
nutrient media composition under cool florescent light (~2500 lx) at 24 °C (±1 °C)
and 16:8 light dark cycle in a photo bioreactor.

Effect of organic carbon sources on biomass production and lipid
accumulation
Ignoring CO2 in air, the effect of different
organic carbon sources like glucose, glycerol, sodium acetate, and sucrose) was
also tested with selected BG-11 growth media. Carbon content of different organic
sources was kept same (0.5 g/L) during the experiment. Sterile media was used
during whole experiment. The experiments were conducted at room temperature
(~22–30 °C) under cool white, fluorescent light for 14 days. 1 l bottle was used
as a lab scale photobioreactor. Working volume of photobioreactor was kept 600 ml
with 10 % (v/v) inoculum. The photoperiod was set 16:8 light: dark period with
fluorescent illumination of ~3000 lx. The culture was aerated (200 ml/min) by
aquarium pump to avoid settling of microalgal biomass. The experiment was
performed for 14 days at batch scale. Initial pH of medium was adjusted to be
7.0.

Analytical methods
Cultivation parameters
Microalgae growth was determined by measuring the optical density
at 680 nm (OD680) using UV–visible spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) daily
and related to algal biomass (g/L). For biomass estimation 10 ml sample
containing algae was filtered through pre-weighted Whatman GF/C glass fiber
filter and dried in oven at 60 °C until constant weight. The dry weight of algae
is determined by subtracting from final weight of whatman GF/C glass fiber
filter with algae to initial weight.

The biomass productivity P (mg/L/day) was calculated by following
equation: 1 P=W2-W1t where, W1 was the initial biomass
concentration, W2 was the biomass concentration at the
last day of cultivation, t was the
cultivation time.

Lipid extraction and measurement
Lipid was extracted by applying Folch extraction method (Folch et
al. 1957). According to this method,
a weighted amount of biomass (0.250 mg) was dissolved in 5 ml
chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) and vortex for 30 s. This was followed by
agitating the mixture for 15–20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then
centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to separate cell debris from supernatant.
This supernatant was washed by 0.9 % NaCl solution and vortex for few seconds.
The mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min. Lower chloroform layer with
lipid was removed carefully and collected in 20 ml pre-weighted glass vial. The
residue was re-extracted with 2.5 ml chloroform/methanol (1:1 v/v) thrice as
stated above. The supernatant was collected in same vial. The solvent was then
dried at 65 °C in oven until constant weight of lipid was achieved. The lipid
content was calculated gravimetrically. The lipid productivity (mg/L/d) was
calculated by the following equation: 2 Lipidproductivity=Lipidcontentt×W1-Lipidcontent0×W2t×1000 where Lipid contentt was the lipid content at
the last day of cultivation and Lipid content0 was the
initial lipid content in algal cells.

Fatty acid profile analysis
Fatty acid extracted by Folch method was converted to their
methyl esters by transesterification. Lipid was dissolved in 1 ml of 1 % NaOH in
CH3OH and heated for 55 °C for 15 min. Then, 2 ml of
5 % methanolic HCl was added and again heated for 15 min at 55 °C. The obtained
product mixture was washed with distilled water. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME)
were extracted using 1 ml hexane thrice and evaporated to dryness (Kumari et al.
2011). FAME was re-dissolved in
200 µl hexane and analyzed using a Gas chromatograph (Nucon 5700 series)
equipped with Flame ionization detector (FID) using EOX column (serial no 5061;
30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm). Pure Nitrogen (99.999 %) used as carrier gas with a
flow rate of 1 ml/min and pre-column pressure of 49.7 kPa. The initial
temperature was set at 160 °C for 2 min, followed by a 4 °C/min ramp up to
240 °C and maintained for 50 min. The injector and FID detector temperature was
set at 240 and 220 °C, respectively. FAME peaks were identified by the
comparison of their retention time with authentic standard by GC and quantified
by normalization. Methylated heptadecanoic acid was used as an internal
standard.

Prediction of fuel properties

Result and discussion
Characterization of microalgae strains
Five strains of fresh water microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella
minutissima, Chlorella pyrenoidosa,
Chlorella sp. 1 and Chlorella sp.
2) selected for the laboratory experiments belong to the division of Chlorophyta
and the class of Chlorophyceae. The pictures of all the five green microalgae were
taken by an optical microscope (S1). One microalgae species was isolated from
Dehradun region and identified morphologically. Characteristics and Morphological
features of the isolated microalgae have its close similarity with genus Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima, Chlorella
pyrenoidosa, and chlorella sp. 2
and represented here as Chlorella sp. 1. The
individual cells of the colonies were in the range of 2–10 µm. Microalgal cells
were green color, unicellular, and spherical in shape.

Screening and identification of efficient growth media for maximum lipid
productivity
All the microalgae species (Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Chlorella sp. 1, and Chlorella sp. 2) were cultured in four media i.e. BG-11, BBM, Fog’s
and M4N medium in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (conical flask)
each containing 125 ml media. The results revealed that all the microalgal species
had approximately 2 days lag period and reached the exponential phase within
4–6 days in all the media. Microalgae cells achieved stationary phase within
15 days and after that cells growth was very slow as shown in Fig. 1. As each microalgal species shows different
biochemical composition (e.g., protein, amino acids, carbohydrate, lipid, fatty
acids, chlorophyll and carotenoids) in different media which is reflected by
different optical density (OD) of samples. Hence, biomass dry weight (DW) does not
correlate well with OD for different culture media or strains. To avoid this
error, actual biomass concentration dry weight (DW) was used to study microalgae
growth in different media. DW biomass concentration of all the five microalgae
species at the stationary phase are shown Fig. 2. It was examined that highest biomass concentration of
Chlorella vulgaris was in BG-11
(1.64 ± 0.07 g/L), followed by BBM (1.58 ± 0.05 g/L), Fog’s medium
(1.33 ± 0.03 g/L) and M4N (1.30 ± 0.04 g/L). Similarly,
Chlorella minutissima (1.52 ± 0.03 g/L) and
Chlorella sp. 1 (1.39 ± 0.05 g/L) also showed
maximum biomass concentration in BG-11. But, in case of Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Chlorella sp. 2, biomass concentration was maximum (1.69 ± 0.02 and
1.48 ± 0.06 g/L, respectively) in Fog’s medium. This can be explained by the fact
that higher nitrogen concentration is favorable for increasing biomass growth (Li
et al. 2012). However,
M4N (having maximum nitrogen concentration) showed poor
biomass concentration which is due to deleterious effect of nitrogen at higher
concentrations (Li et al. 2012).Fig. 1 OD of Chlorella vulgaris,

Lipid content was reported as a percentage of lipids to biomass DW.
Similar to biomass yield, significant variances in lipid content were found across
strains and culture media. Lipid contents and productivity of all the five strains
in different culture media are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively.
Maximum lipid content and productivity was found in BBM media for all the
Chlorella
species. The highest lipid content of
15.87 ± 0.77 % was found for Chlorella sp. 1
cultivated in BBM, followed by Chlorella
vulgaris (15.57 ± 1.44 %), Chlorella
minutissima (12.95 ± 0.53 %), Chlorella
pyrenoidosa (11.43 ± 1.26 %) and Chlorella sp. 2 (9.64 ± 0.86 %) in BBM medium. Minimum lipid content
was observed in M4N growth medium. Furthermore, all
microalgae species showed highest lipid productivity in BBM growth media and
lowest in M4N medium. Among all the tested species, maximum
lipid productivity was observed for Chlorella
vulgaris (12.35 ± 0.37 mg/L/d), followed by Chlorella sp. 1 (9.56 ± 0.43 mg/L/d), Chlorella minutissima (9.41 ± 0.67 mg/L/d), Chlorella pyrenoidosa (8.88 ± 0.41 mg/L/d) and Chlorella sp. 2 (6.39 ± 0.35 mg/L/d). These data are
supported by the fact that nitrogen starvation condition results in more lipid
accumulation (Converti et al. 2009;
Chen et al. 2011; Feng et al.
2011; Kumari et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012). The selection of culture medium depends upon various
factors viz. the target product, growth rate, and medium cost. However, nitrogen
is the key factor in growth medium and also a limiting nutrient affecting the
biomass growth and lipid productivity of various microalgae (Griffiths and
Harrison 2009). Culture media
comparison shows that on an average BBM gave highest lipid content and
productivity, followed by BG-11, whereas Fog’s medium and
M4N had the lowest. Generally, lipid content of
microalgae increases when microalgae are subjected to unfavorable culture
conditions, such as nutrient starvation (Converti et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2011; Feng et al. 2011). According to Li et al. (2012), the lipid yield of microalgae species can be improved by
at least 300 % under nitrogen limited conditions. Since, lipid production is the
main aim of microalgae cultivation in this study, BBM and BG-11 are the preferred
growth media. BBM had higher lipid content and productivity due to relatively
lower nitrogen and phosphate concentrations, whereas, BG-11 medium being nitrogen
rich medium has good potential to increase lipid productivity by applying nitrogen
deficient condition (Li et al. 2012).
Furthermore, total cost of chemicals to prepare 1 l medium was found to be Rs.
0.784 and Rs. 0.472 for BG-11 and BBM growth media, respectively. When applying
nitrogen deficient medium (suppose half concentration of nitrogen in case of
BG-11) to culture algae, the cost of BG-11 preparation will be reduced up to Rs.
0.460. While BBM is already nitrogen deficient medium and further decrease in
nitrogen concentration will results in reduction of total lipid productivity.
Therefore, on the basis of potential of growth medium for enhancing lipid
productivity and cost reduction, BG-11 had been considered as best medium in this
study and used as culture medium for further study.Fig. 3 Comparison of lipid content of five microalgal strains in four

Effect of carbon sources on microalgae growth and lipid
accumulation
In this study, all the Chlorella
species were grown in optimized BG-11 medium (optimized in previous
research paper, Sharma et al. 2016)
with different organic carbon sources at room temperature and 16:8 light:dark
cycle. The supplemented organic carbon sources were glucose (7.22 mM), glycerol
(14.13 mM), sodium acetate (21.09 mM) and sucrose (3.51 mM) with fixed amount of
carbon content (0.5 g/L).

Among the tested organic carbon sources, glucose was found the best
carbon source for mixotrophic growth of all the Chlorella strains, followed by glycerol, sodium acetate and sucrose.
The study showed that addition of glucose results in maximum biomass production of
2.08, 2.04, 1.84, 1.53 and 1.43 g/L for Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Chlorella sp. 1 and Chlorella sp. 2 at stationary phase (Fig. 5). However, all the microalgae species achieved maximum biomass
concentration within 8–11 days in the culture medium supplemented with glucose and
the average highest biomass productivity were found 274.46 mg/L/day for Chlorella vulgaris, followed by 239.15 mg/L/day for
Chlorella minutissima, 191.28 mg/L/day for
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, 162.52 mg/L/day for
Chlorella sp. 1 and 111.36 mg/L/day for
Chlorella sp. 1, respectively. Biomass
concentration of all the microalgal stains was poor in sucrose culture medium at
stationary phase. These results are in agreement with previous report that glucose
is an efficient trigger to increase biomass productivity of the microalgae
(Perez-Garcia et al. 2011a; Cheirsilp
and Torpee 2012; Sun et al.
2014). This can be explained by the
fact that glucose is the raw material for photosynthesis and under mixotrophic
growth, it can be utilized in the presence of light for energy metabolism for ATP
and NAD(P)H production, and, therefore, biomass growth can be accelerated (Yang et
al. 2000). On the other hand, lipid
contents of four Chlorella strains (Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella
minutissima, Chlorella
pyrenoidosa, Chlorella sp. 1) were
significantly higher in culture medium supplemented with glycerol as carbon source
and followed by sodium acetate, glucose, and sucrose organic carbon sources, while
Chlorella sp. 2 showed maximum lipid content
in sodium acetate culture medium (Fig. 6).
Maximum lipid production was 24.32 % for Chlorella
vulgaris, 18.59 % for Chlorella
minutissima, 17.10 % for Chlorella
pyrenoidosa and 23.31 % for Chlorella sp. 1 in glycerol culture medium while 13.42 % for Chlorella sp. 2 in sodium
acetate. Lipid production was found to be lowest in case of sucrose
carbon source for all the tested microalgal strains except Chlorella sp. 2 which showed exceptional behavior and minimum lipid
content of this species was in glycerol. Maximum lipid yield observed for the
tested microalgal strains was 490.74 mg/L for Chlorella
vulgaris, 369.13 mg/L for Chlorella
minutissima, 282.59 mg/L for Chlorella
pyrenoidosa, and 325.4 mg/L for Chlorella sp. 1 in glycerol culture medium which was more than
twofolds higher in comparison to control culture (phototrophic culture) for all
these species. On the other hand, Chlorella sp.
2 had shown highest lipid yield (188.58 mg/L) in glucose. This can be explained by
the fact that glucose is a simple hexose monosaccharide, which is first
catabolized into glucose-6-phosphate (important intermediate product for various
metabolic precursors) and subsequently to pyruvate through anaerobic glycolysis
process, then it enters into tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) followed by
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATPs production (Lu et al.
2011). On the other hand, glycerol
enters the cells by simple diffusion without any extra energy, does not behave as
a source of carbons for biosynthesis (Perez-Garcia et al. 2011b). The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is
inhibited during glycerol assimilation (Chen et al. 2011). More glycerol would be used in the Embden–Meyerh of
pathway (EMP), and then sacrifice to generate lipids. Furthermore, glycerol is a
substrate for triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. Overall, it was found that
different biomass and lipid productions of all the five microalgal species were
due to their different metabolic pathways of carbon and energy sources. Lipid
productivity of Chlorella vulgaris
(50.17 mg/L/d), Chlorella pyrenoidosa
(23.91 mg/L/d) and Chlorella sp. 1
(28.69 mg/L/d) was observed best in glycerol medium, whereas Chlorella minutissima (35.8 mg/L/d) and Chlorella sp. 2 (14.73 mg/L/d) showed maximum lipid
productivity in glucose supplemented culture medium (Fig. 7). But higher cost of glucose is a major hurdle to
microalgal biodiesel production economics. Additionally, glycerol is much cheaper
than glucose and also a byproduct of biodiesel production. Therefore, utilizing
glycerol for microalgae cultivation may be a good approach for recycling it and
reduction of biodiesel production cost. Hence, glycerol is more promising
candidate to make algae biodiesel economically viable.Fig. 5 Biomass growths of Chlorella

Predicted fuel properties of biodiesel extracted from Chlorella species
Fuel properties of biodiesel are highly influenced by fatty acid
composition of algae. Fatty acid composition of Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa
Chlorella sp. 1 and Chlorella sp. 2 is shown in Table 1. Results showed that Chlorella
pyrenoidosa contains higher saturated FAME (45.07 %) than Chlorella vulgaris (31.73 %), Chlorella minutissima (35.14 %), Chlorella sp. 1 (33.14 %) and Chlorella sp. 2 (44.94 %), whereas mono unsaturated fatty acid were
found maximum for Chlorella minutissima
(38.01 %), followed by Chlorella sp. 2
(34.53 %), Chlorella pyrenoidosa (33.42 %),
Chlorella vulgaris (21.76 %) and Chlorella sp. 2 (17.34 %). Further analysis showed that
polyunsaturated fatty acid were 36.14, 25.33, 19.87, 32.36 and 36.19 % in
Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa,
Chlorella sp. 1 and Chlorella sp. 2, respectively. Previous research showed that ideal
biodiesel would have low level of polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids to
support the favorable oxidative stability and cold flow problem (Knothe
2009; Hoekman et al. 2012). Therefore, presence of monounsaturated
fatty acids, such as palmitoleic acid (16:1) and oleic acid (18:1), play a big
role for giving the best compromise between oxidative stability and cold flow
(Knothe 2009; Hoekman et al.
2012). In this study,
monounsaturated fatty acids were analyzed from 17.34 to 38.01 % for the tested
Chlorella strains. Among the tested species,
Chlorella minutissima showed maximum
monounsaturated fatty acids (38.01 %) and Chlorella sp. 2 showed minimum monounsaturated fatty acids
(17.34 %).Table 1 Fatty acid composition of Chlorella

It was reported that biodiesel composition enriched with C16–C18
fatty acids have good fuel properties (Knothe 2009). As shown in Table 1, fatty acid compositions of all Chlorella strains have major constituent of palmitic (16:0), stearic
(18:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), and linolenic (18:3) acids. The presence of
more polyunsaturated FAME results in lower oxidation stability of biodiesel. This
can be explained by the fact that polyunsaturated FAME contains reactive sites
which are susceptible for attack of free radicals during oxidation reaction.
According to European standards EN14214, for an ideal biodiesel the percentage of
linolenic acid (C18:3) and polyunsaturated FA (>4 double bond) should not
increase 12 and 1 %, respectively (Knothe 2009). Maximum linolenic acid (C18:3) was found in Chlorella sp. 2. (14.20 %) while minimum was for
Chlorella vulgaris (4.55 %). Furthermore,
polyunsaturated FA (>4 double bond) was absent in all the Chlorella strains.

Table 2 shows predicted
fuel properties of Chlorella vulgaris,
Chlorella minutissima
Chlorella pyrenoidosa Chlorella sp. 1 and
Chlorella sp. 2. Iodine value is the
measurement of total unsaturation in biodiesel. Higher Iodine Value of the
biodiesel may result in the polymerization of glycerides and deposition of
lubricant in the engine (Francisco et al. 2010). According to European standards EN 14214, iodine value of
biodiesel should not be more than 120 g I2/100 g. In this study, maximum iodine
value was observed for Chlorella sp. 1 (99.92)
while Chlorella pyrenoidosa showed minimum
iodine value (68.90). Cetane number indicates combustion behavior of fuel in
engine. The higher cetane value results in better combustion of fuel, lower NOx
emission, less occurrence of knocking and easier start- up of engine. According to
ASTMD6751, European (EN 14214) and Australian standard and National Petroleum
Agency (ANP255) standard the minimum cetane value should be 47, 51 and 45,
respectively. In this study the cetane value of Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Chlorella sp. 1 and
Chlorella sp. 2 is found 57.10, 54.42, 58.47,
50.88 and 54.68 which satisfied the above standards. Oxidation stability of
biodiesel depends of presence of polyunsaturated FAME in biodiesel. This can be
explained by the fact that polyunsaturated FAME contains reactive sites which are
susceptible for attack of free radicals during oxidation reaction. According to EN
14214, the oxidative stability should be above 6 h. In this case, oxidation
stability of five strains recorded 5.8–8.5 h. Cold fuel properties, such as cold
filter plugging point, cloud point and pour point, are the most important
properties for low temperatures applications. CP is the temperature at which
crystallization begins and PP at which fuel no longer pours. These properties are
highly affected by the presence of saturated FAME in biodiesel. Higher value of
saturated FAME will result in poor cold properties. ASTM D6751 specifies CP range
−3 to 12 °C and PP −15 to 20 °C. Five Chlorella
strains examined in this study showed CP ranges from 6.43 to 14.86 °C and PP from
0.16 to 9.32 °C. Calorific value is the indication of energy produced by the
combustion of fuel and it was found to be maximum (40.78 MJ/Kg) for Chlorella vulgaris and minimum for followed by
Chlorella sp1 (39.66 MJ/Kg).Table 2 Fuel properties of biodiesel produced from Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima, Chlorella

Conclusion
This study investigates the effect of various growth media and
organic carbon sources on biomass and lipid production potential of five Chlorella species (Chlorella
vulgaris, Chlorella minutissima,
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Chlorella sp. 1 and Chlorella sp.
2). The results revealed that all the species showed good potential for lipid
production in BG-11 supplemented with glycerol in comparison to controlled medium.
However, maximum lipid yield was observed for Chlorella
vulgaris (490.74 ± 12.30 mg/L) among all the tested species. On the
basis of lipid productivity, fatty acid composition and fuel properties, it is
observed that Chlorella vulgaris showed good
potential in BG-11 growth media supplemented with glycerol under mixotrophic
condition for biodiesel production, but it further needs research for the
optimization of C:N:P ratio for large-scale biodiesel production.
