side effects than drugs of synthetic origin. Bioassay-guided selection of active
fraction of a plant extract and further isolation and characterization of the pure
bioactive compounds are in practice in both academic and industrial research.
Zingiberaceae, a medicinally important, ornamental, monocotyledonous family has
potential members in the tribe Alpinieae, among which the genus Alpinia is studied under this current review due to its
wide range of biomedical applications. The members in the genus possess many
bioactive compounds against harmful microbes to deadly diseases like cancer by
regulating the different signalling pathway systems. Several compounds have been
discovered and found to deliver diversified biological efficacy either in vitro or
in vivo against a range of diseases. The chemical profiling of the genus and
investigation of crude essential oils and individual bioactive compounds towards the
therapeutic importance in various disciplines have been documented in the current
review.

Introduction
Plant-derived drug research has become more promising in recent years and also a
better alternative for synthetic medicine and therapeutics in spite of many
challenges (Vanwyk and Wink 2009). The
bioactive natural compounds isolated from various parts of a plant are the key
research thrust for a chemist, biologist, pharmacist, and medical professionals to
tease and tap the potential of the so-called the ‘wonder’ molecules. In spite of
great technological advancement in the field of applied science, medical treatments
are still in its infancy when the treatment against the deadly diseases like cancer
is considered. In many cases, it has been found that treatment of such diseases with
the chemosynthetic drugs shows frequent side effects, toxicity, severe mental and
physical abnormalities, not acceptable to the patient and to their families. Hence,
the conservative mode of medical treatments and synthetic drugs available ‘off the
shelf’ appears to be a serious concern.

Nearly, 21,000 plants have been listed by the World Health Organization (WHO),
which are in use for diverse medicinal purposes around the world. Being the largest
producer of medicinal herbs, India is known as the botanical garden of the world
catering to the needs for herbal medicines (Seth and Sharma 2004). The WHO report revealed that around 80 % of
world population depends on the traditional medicines, largely on plant-derived
drugs towards their healthcare, among which 30 % of currently used therapeutics are
from natural resources alone. Owing to the increasing cultural acceptability and
significantly lower side effects, nearly 75–80 % of the whole population in the
developing countries mostly prefers the herbal treatment for primary health care
(Ghasi et al. 2000).

Ethnopharmacogological knowledge towards the scientific investigation of
medicinally important plants augments the prospects of alternative medicine and
therapeutic values. The ethnomedical practices of the tribal communities of North
East India were critically studied and documented for the Zingiberaceae family
towards their future pharmacological diagnostics (Tushar et al. 2010). This important family is distributed
worldwide with about 50 genera and 1,300 diverse species mainly concentrating in
South and Southeast Asia (Wu and Larson 2000). In India, about 22 genera and 178 species have been reported
from North Eastern and peninsular region (Jain and Prakash 1995), whereas North East region alone harbours 19
genera and close to about 88 diverse species (Prakash and Mehrotra 1995). Latin and species description in many cases
are in doubtful identity.

The largest genus of the family Zingiberaceae, Alpinia, was classified by Charles Plumier, the famous French botanist
and named after Prospero Alpino, the well-known Italian botanist of sixteenth
century. The genus, Alpinia belongs to the
flowering plants group (angiosperms); as per the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group II (APG
II) system, it comes under the umbrella of monocotyledonous plants (Angiosperm
Phylogeny Group 2003), belonging to the order Zingiberales, subfamily Alpinioideae
and tribe Alpinieae. The genus includes 230–250 species distributed throughout
tropical and subtropical climates of Asia and the Pacific. DNA-based studies showed
the genus as polyphyletic represented by six clades scattered across the tribe
Alpinieae (Kress et al. 2005).

Majority of the members of the genus produces attractive inflorescence,
possesses aromatic aerial and underground parts generally subjected to different
fractionation process for the extraction of essential oils, aqueous extract and
bioactive components. Various parts of this plant have significant potential to
yield bioactive components towards the development of future therapeutics
(Fig. 1). The essential oil extracted from
different parts of the plant contains diverse natural compounds having multiple
medicinal properties. Because of its multipurpose utility, the genus Alpinia demands much attention from the researchers
towards the development of potential therapeutics against various diseases like
cancer, diabetes, ulcer and many neural disorders. Several research and reviews
shows the importance and medical application of potential bioactive compounds
isolated from different species of the genus and further research is continuing to
unveil the mechanism of action of the natural bioactive compounds in regulating the
disease progression and cure. The current aim of this study is to highlight the
exhaustive pharmacological information and promising therapeutic uses of the genus
Alpinia.Fig. 1 Different plant parts of A.

Isolation and characterization of natural bioactive compound
(phyotochemistry)
The members of the genus Alpinia have complex
chemical profiles and possess diverse flavonoids and are being considered as
chemosystematic markers for the key identification and order classification
(Pugialli et al. 1993). The flavonoids,
in general, are known to be responsible for yellow pigmentation in plant tissues,
and are potential source of antioxidants, many of which have anticancerous
activities due to the presence of functional keto (C=O) or aldehyde (–CHO) groups
(Williams et al. 2004). The aqueous and
organic solvent extract harbours many bioactive compounds and their natural
derivatives which differ from species to species and also plant parts used
(rhizomes, stems, leaves, flowers, seeds and fruits) for isolation
(Table 1).Table 1 List of prospective pharmacologically important bioactive

Therefore, before exploitation of these natural compounds for diverse biological
activities, isolation and characterization for each of them need to be done
primarily by different spectral and analytical techniques. The isolation, chemical
and molecular characterization of natural compounds has been done by standard
bioanalytical techniques like preparative thin layer chromatography (pTLC), column
chromatography (CC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultraviolet (UV)
spectral analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),
13C and 1H nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and mass spectroscopy (MS). Till date, several bioactive compounds
have been isolated and characterized from different species of the genus Alpinia. Some notable are enlisted in Table 1.

Bio-pharmaceutical potential
Reviewing of the genus Alpinia showed its
incredible biopharmaceutical potentials as evident from earlier published reports
and is gaining the attention of researchers from different disciplines. The presence
of the bioactive substances such as flavonoids, tannins and terpenes is the key for
its therapeutic efficiency. The potential biomedical applications of diverse species
of Alpinia are depicted in Fig. 2. Brief accounts of its biological efficacy towards
the therapeutic uses are described below.Fig. 2 Diverse biomedical application of Alpinia species



Antimicrobial activity
A great depth of antimicrobial activities has been reported from Alpinia species having diverse chemical profile. Till
date most of the work has been concentrated in A.
galanga which contain more bioactive compounds compared to other
species in the genera (Janssen and Scheffer 1985; Oonmetta-aree et al. 2006; Khattak et al. 2005; Weerakkody et al. 2011; Rao et al. 2010; Niyomkam et al. 2010). Essential oil extracted from fresh and dried rhizomes of
A. galanga have potential antimicrobial
activities against a range of bacteria, fungi, yeast and parasite. Ethanol extract
from rhizome showed cytological modification to Staphyllococcus aureus cells by altering outer membrane integrity
(Oonmetta-aree et al. 2006). However,
the galangal extract, being hydrophobic in nature, could not inhibit the
proliferation of gram-negative bacteria as the extract unable to penetrate the
lipopolysaccharide monolayer of outer membrane of the cell wall. Terpinen-4-ol, a
monoterpene, purified from the essential oil of fresh galangal rhizomes, showed
antimicrobial activity against Trichophyton
mentagrophytes. Similarly, acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA) isolated
from dried rhizomes of A. galanga, is
potentially active against several bacteria and many dermatophytes (Janssen and
Scheffer 1985).

Besides the A. galanga, other species, viz.
A. oxyphylla, A.
speciosa, A. zerumbet and many
others are gaining attention due to the presence of diverse polyphenolic compounds
and their complex chemical profile. Various studies showed the antimicrobial
potential of crude ethanolic extract, chloroform extract, hydrodistillation
extract and a number of purified compounds against a wide spectrum of
microorganism (Table 2). Moreover, recent
findings showed antiviral potential of diarylheptanoid from A. katsumadai seeds. The extracts showed in vitro
neuraminidase inhibitory activities against human influenza virus A/PR/8/34 of
subtype H1N1 (Grienke et al. 2010).
Further, different fractions of ethanolic extract were found promising against
A/Chicken/Korea/MS96/96 (H9N2) influenza viruses operated by inhibiting viral
hemagglutinin binding to the sialic acid receptors in the host cell (Kwon et al.
2010). The significant
antimicrobial activities of different fractions and pure components of Alpinia species are catalogued in Table 2.Table 2 List of antimicrobial, antiparasitic and insecticidal actions of
bioactive fractions and pure compounds of Alpinia species

Antiparasitic and insecticidal activity
Many parasites and insects pose severe threat to human and animal health. A
number of medicinally important plants were tested towards their potential as an
antiamoebic agent and it was found that the chloroform extracts from A. galanga to be highly effective with an added desired
advantage of less side effects than traditional medicine, viz. metronidazole
(Sawangjaroen et al. 2006). Miyazawa
et al. (2000) reported that
methanolic extract of A. oxyphylla was found to
possess insecticidal activity against larvae of Drosophila
melanogaster Meigen. From the crude extract, an insecticidal compound
was separated by bioassay-guided fractionation and identified to be nootkatone by
GC, GC–MS, and 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. Further, bioassay-guided studies for
insecticidal activity, nootkatone showed a LC50 value of 11.5 μmol/mL of diet
against larvae of D. melanogaster and a LD50
value of 96 μg/L against adults. Another compound, epinootkatol, however, showed
moderate insecticidal activity in both assays, indicating that the carbonyl group
at the 2-position in nootkatone was important for enhanced insecticidal activity
(Fig. 3).Fig. 3 The structure of Nootkatone and Epinootkatol isolated from
A. oxyphylla fruits, where they
differ on their 2-position due to the presence of carbonyl (–C=O) and
aldehyde (–CHO) group, respectively



Recently, for the first time antileishmanial phenylpropanoids has been
isolated using hexane, chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts of A. galanga rhizome (Kaur et al. 2010). Among several compounds purified,
p-coumaryl diacetate, 1′-acetoxychavicol
acetate, 1′-acetoxyeugenol acetate and trans-p-acetoxycinnamyl alcohol
were found most promising in vitro against promastigotes of L. donovani with IC50 values of 39.3, 32.9, 18.9 and
79.9 μM, respectively. The genus, Alpinia
harbour prospective compounds towards the antiparastic and insecticidal actions as
enlisted in Table 2.

Anticancerous activity
Many in vitro studies that have been done in diverse cancer cell lines and in
vivo studies with animal models reflect clearly the potential of Alpinia species as anticancerous plant. For instance, a
novel compound, Pinostrobin chalcone, has been isolated from A. mutica which displays notable cytotoxic potential to
various human carcinoma cell lines (KB, MCF7 and Caski cells) with significant
IC50 values (Malek et al. 2011).
Antiangiogenic potential of A. oxyphylla fruits
has been found in n-hexane and ethyl acetate
fractions and tested against zebrafish model, human umbilical vein endothelial
cells and tumour cell lines and have been hypothesized against cancer and
inflammation diseases (He et al. 2010). Investigation of Nam et al. (2005) on the n-hexane and
chloroform extract of A. galanga rhizome lead
to the isolation of two compounds, viz. 1′-(S)-1′-acetoxychavicol acetate and p-coumaryl alcohol γ-O-methyl
ether. Of the two compounds, former showed significant cytotoxic activity against
human cancer cell lines like A549 (IC50 = 8.14 μg/mL), SNU638 (IC50 = 1.27 μg/mL),
HT1080 (IC50 = 1.2 μg/mL), HL60 (IC50 = 2.39 μg/mL) and HCT116
(IC50 = 1.77 μg/mL). Whereas, the second compound revealed specific activity
against SNU638 (IC50 = 1.62 μg/mL). In some other cancer cell lines cytotoxic
activity has been screened with four different compounds isolated from A. officinarum and only
7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4-en-3-heptanone was found
remarkable cytotoxic agent against HepG2, MCF-7 and SF-268 (An et al. 2008).

Lu et al. (2007) studied the
effect of flavonoid constituents of A.
officinarum on whitening effects based on melanin biosynthesis in B
16 mouse melanoma cells. The flavonoid mixture and galangin exhibited a broad
absorption band at 270–290 nm related to the UV-B area supporting that galangin
could be a whitening agent and a capable candidate for prevention of skin cancer.
The summarized anticancerous activities of the crude extract and isolated
principal compounds of the genus Alpinia are
listed in Table 3.Table 3 List of anticancerous, antiinflammatory and analgesic activities

Antiinflammatory and analgesic activity
Inflammation is a protective response by the organism to eliminate the
injurious stimuli and to initiate the healing process. It’s a complex biological
response of vascular tissues to detrimental stimuli such as pathogens, injured
cells or external irritants (Ferrero-Miliani et al. 2007). Therefore, antiinflammatory drugs refer to the property of
a substance that trims down inflammation. Antiinflammatory drugs reduce
inflammation without affecting the central nervous system and make up about half
of analgesics available in the market. Medication towards inflammation depends on
steroids, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), immune selective
antiinflammatory derivatives (ImSAIDs) and herbal drugs. However, inhibitions of
natural hormones and liver dysfunction are the common side effects of steroidal
drugs (Urhausen et al. 2003; Hartgens
et al. 1996). Similarly, NSAID can
cause gastric erosions, leading to stomach ulcers and in extreme cases can cause
severe haemorrhage, resulting in death by myocardial infarction and stroke (Trelle
et al. 2011). Therefore, ImSAIDs and
herbal drugs are more acceptable to treat inflammation and remedying pain. There
are several bioactive compounds that have been isolated from Alpinia species which shows antiinflammatory and
analgesic actions.

Natural bioactive compounds and crude hydroalcoholic fractions isolated from
the Alpinia species like A. galanga, A.
zerumbet, A. officinarum, etc.,
showed potential activities as antiinflammatory and analgesic agent. Aqueous and
hydroalcoholic extracts from leaves and rhizomes of above species possesses key
factors responsible for antinociceptive (reducing sensitivity to painful stimuli)
and antiallergic properties. Diarylheptanoids, a novel class of potent
platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists from A.
officinarum rhizome extract was recently identified (Fan et al.
2007), which also showed
antirheumatic, antipsychiatric and analgesic activities with 80 % ethanolic
extract (Lee et al. 2009). A brief
account of the antiinflammatory, analgesic and other related activities of
Alpinia are listed in Table 3.

Neuroprotective activity
A. galanga has been exhaustively explored
towards diverse biological activities in most of the cases among different
Alpinia species. Recently, chloroform
fraction of A. galanga has been found as
antiamnesic probably due to the presence of 1′S-1′-acetoxyeuginol acetate as lead compound (Singh et al.
2011a). A.
oxyphylla fruit was found to have the neuroprotective activities (Koo
et al. 2004) and subsequently many
other Alpinia species have been reported since
(Table 4). Protocatechuic acid (PCA), a
principal compound of the A. oxyphylla,
protects against oxidative damage in vitro and reduces oxidative stress in vivo
(Shi et al. 2006). It has been shown
that PCA also reduces the hydrogen peroxide or sodium nitroprusside induced cell
death in PC12 cells in dose-dependent manner (An et al. 2006) and this offers a valuable therapeutic
strategy for the cure of oxidative stress-induced neurodegenerative disease like
Parkinson’s disease. Other reports revealed that A.
katsumadai seed extract protects neurons from ischaemic damage (Li et
al. 2011a) and the treatment
significantly decreased the activation of astrocytes and microglia in the
hippocampal CA1 region (Li et al. 2011b). Similarly, methanolic extract of A. officinarum rhizome showed protection against oxidative damage in
PC 12 cells (Chang et al. 2011).Table 4 List of neuroprotective and antioxidant activities exhibited by

potential as antipsychotic and antioxidant agent (de Araújo et al. 2011) which may have promising efficacy for the
treatment of schizophrenia. On the other hand, A.
galanga ethanol extract shows antiamnesiac effect in Amyloid β
induced neurodegeneration (Singh et al. 2011b). Members of the Alpinia
genus are found to have a remarkable antioxidant activity which in turn gives more
biological efficacy towards the development of therapeutics. The antioxidant
activities of the genus are enlisted in Table 4.

Besides above activities, the genus is also emerging as the prospective source
for antiageing compound which is found to be PCA from A.
oxyphylla (Zhang et al. 2011a). Aqueous acetone extract of A.
officinarum rhizome showed inhibition to melanogenesis process
(Matsuda et al. 2009), whereas
acetone extract of A. oxyphylla fruits acts as
a potent skin permeation enhancer (Fang et al. 2003). Recent studies revealed two bioactive compounds from
A. zerumbet rhizome and leaves, viz.
5,6-dehydrokawain (DK) and dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain (DDK). The compounds were
found to be potent inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase and neuraminidase (Upadhyay et al.
2011) indicating that it could be
used as potent drugs against those viral diseases.

Future perspective and consideration
In the current study, it has been observed that various plant parts of different
Alpinia species are used to get the bioactive
compounds and different fractions show remarkable biological efficacy against
various biomedical challenges. Detailed examination of the gathered data in
Alpinia shows that rhizome is the main plant
part used for pharmacological investigation, whereas other vegetative and
reproductive parts were used moderately (Fig. 4). Most of the cases it has been observed that rhizomes harbour
most of the essential oil components and showed potential biological activities at
different scale. It has also been observed that various solvent systems were used in
the bioactivity studies and isolation of bioactive compounds from the plant parts
which acts as a key factor in terms of yield, number of compounds, type of
compounds, etc. In the current study, it has been clearly observed that ethanol
fraction has been the most preferred solvent system which has been used either in
the initial crude oil extraction or in the further fractionation process
(Fig. 5). The aqueous solvent was found to
be the second best choice for the study as it also can extract copious amount of
essential oil from different plant parts, but it varies from species to species. The
bioactive compounds or crude fractions of essential oils from various species of
Alpinia were found to be promising against
various biomedical challenges like antimicrobial, anticancerous, antileshmania and
many more. Also, in the current study, it has been observed that various species of
Alpinia has ample potential to overpower
biomedical threats including the most diverse microbes in the mother earth.
Moreover, the genus Alpinia harbours versatile
components towards its diverse biological efficacy (Fig. 6). Much more understanding and further exploration will be needed
towards the other unexplored species of the genus, viz. A.
nigra, A. katsumadai, A. pahangensis, A.
nieuwenhuizii and many more to circumvent the future biomedical
challenges.Fig. 4 The graph represents the use of various plant parts in terms of
percent use towards the versatile bioactivity studies under consideration in
the current review

Fig. 5 Different solvent system has been used for the extraction of crude
oil and bioactive components. Each bar
represents the percentage of uses of each solvent towards the extraction
method related to the genus Alpinia
documented under current study

field of biomedical sciences related to the genus Alpinia and expressed in terms of percentage biological
activities considered under the current study



Conclusion
Detailed account of the diverse utility of the genus Alpinia can be addressed, starting with the ethnomedicinal information
culminating with exhaustive scientific exploration. Towards the pharmacological
investigation and future diagnostics, drug designing and modulating different
trans-regulating pathways will be useful to fight against the deadly diseases
prevalent in the earth. During the current study, it has been found that the genus
possess plenty of flavonoids, tannin and other polyphenolics which extends its
biological efficacy towards antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancerous and other
therapeutic potentials. It was found in most of the reports and reviews that were
surveyed in the present investigation, the crude extract (aqueous or organic
fractions) to be potential agent for various activities. However, thorough
examination needs to be carried out to see the efficacy and activity of individual
component and in combination to explore the synergistic effects, if any.
