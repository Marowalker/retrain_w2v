production of cellulosic ethanol. This study reports a possible pretreatment method
for miscanthus using aqueous ethylenediamine (EDA) for 30 min at 180 °C with or
without ammonia. The mass ratio of miscanthus to EDA was varied from 1:3, 1:1, and
1:0.5, keeping the mass ratio of miscanthus to liquid (EDA + Water) constant at 1:8.
The ammonia-to-miscanthus ratio was 1:0.25. After pretreatment with a ratio of 1:3
miscanthus to EDA, about 75 % of the lignin was removed from the raw miscanthus with
90 % retention of cellulose and 50 % of hemicellulose in the recovered solid.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of the recovered solid miscanthus gave 63 % glucose and 62 %
xylose conversion after 72 h. EDA provides an effective pretreatment for miscanthus,
achieving good delignification and enhanced sugar yield by enzyme hydrolysis.
Results using aqueous EDA with or without ammonia are much better than those using
hot water and compare favorably with those using aqueous ammonia. The
delignification efficiency of EDA pretreatment is high compared to that for
hot-water pretreatment and is nearly as efficient as that obtained for
aqueous-ammonia pretreatment.

Introduction
Economic and environmental concerns about the continued use of fossil
fuels have prompted a search for alternative fuels using sustainable lignocellulosic
biomass feedstock (Carroll and Somerville 2009). Conversion of abundant and renewable lignocellulosic biomass
to bioethanol as a transportation fuel provides a possible option to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel consumption (Jordan et al. 2012). Miscanthus is a suitable biomass feedstock
because it has high carbohydrate density and low fertilizer requirements for growth
(Padmanabhan et al. 2012; de Vrije et
al. 2009; Carroll and Somerville
2009; Brosse et al. 2012).

The primary constituents of miscanthus biomass are cellulose,
hemicellulose, and lignin (Brosse et al. 2010, 2012; de Vrije et
al. 2009; Carroll and Somerville
2009). For efficient production of
cellulosic biofuels, miscanthus must be pretreated to overcome the barriers that
hinder the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose to fermentable sugars (Kumar et
al. 2009; Rodriguez et al. 2011; Shill et al. 2011; Alvira et al. 2010; Agbor et al. 2011; Cao et al. 2012).
To facilitate enzymatic hydrolysis, an effective pretreatment must remove a
significant fraction of lignin and perhaps, reduce the crystallinity of cellulose
(Kumar et al. 2009; Shill et al.
2011). By decreasing the adherence of
lignin to cellulose, and by disrupting the cellulose crystal structure, the barriers
to hydrolysis are reduced; hydrolytic enzymes can then access the carbohydrates more
easily (Geng and Henderson 2012; Klein-Marcuschamer et al. 2010).

A wide variety of pretreatments has been studied leading to various
degrees of success (Blanch et al. 2011;
Sousa et al. 2009; Kim et al.
2011). Of these, organosolv
pretreatment has long been employed for delignification (Brosse et al. 2009, 2010). Organic solvents, with a little amount of inorganic acid as
catalyst, can achieve a good degree of delignification (El Hage et al. 2009). Various studies in the paper-and-pulp
industries have suggested that a combination of alkali and an organic solvent can
yield a cellulose-rich pulp with a low amount of lignin (Abbot and Bolker
1982; Cochaux et al. 1995). Taking some clues from these studies,
several research groups have employed combination of ammonia or methyl amine with
organic solvents or ionic liquids for delignification of biomass (Cho et al.
2008; Cochaux et al. 1995; Rodriguez and Jimenez 2008; Sarwar et al. 2001; Abbot and Bolker 1982). Also, our recent work on delignification of miscanthus using
a combination of EDA with organic solvents or ionic liquids suggests that EDA helps
to cleave the lignin-carbohydrate link leading to good removal of lignin
(Padmanabhan et al. 2012). EDA provides
an added advantage with respect to higher alkalinity (pH > 12), which is
favorable for the removal of lignin from miscanthus.

Pretreatment is the most expensive step in the overall production of
bioethanol fuel (Klein-Marcuschamer et al. 2010; Tao et al. 2011). Therefore, it is desirable to minimize the loading of reagents
or solvents in biomass treatment while nevertheless achieving a high sugar yield. To
determine the viability of EDA in the pretreatment of miscanthus, we examine the
effects of low and high EDA loadings to miscanthus (0.5:1, 1:1, 3:1). In addition to
reporting EDA-based-pretreatment results, this work also gives a brief comparison
with two well-known pretreatment methods: auto-hydrolysis (hot water) or aqueous
ammonia.

Materials and methods
Raw materials and feedstock
Miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus) samples,
obtained from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, were milled to 4-mm
particles using a rotary mill (Hetsch). These particles were air-dried and stored
in a sealed container. The moisture content of the miscanthus was 6.1 % determined
using a halogen-moisture analyzer (Mettler-Toledo). Table 1 shows the composition of the raw untreated
Miscanthus × giganteus determined using the procedures recommended by the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and other recent publications (Sluiter
et al. 2010a, b; Templeton et al. 2010; Ibáñez and Bauer 2014).Table 1 Contents of individual components (weight %) of raw miscanthus
and recovered solid miscanthus after pretreatment using solvents. For

aFor aqueous EDA (EDA + Water), the total
solvent-to-miscanthus ratio is 8:1 while miscanthus-to-EDA ratio is also
indicated in the table. Miscanthus to ammonia is approximately 1:0.25,
calculated on basis of autoclave volume, temperature and pressure.
Extractives are soluble sugars, non-structural sugars and others which were
extracted in hot water/ethanol solution at 80 °C for 6 h



EDA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA) with a purity of 99.5 %
and used as received. Compressed anhydrous ammonia with a purity of 99.99 % was
purchased from Praxair, USA.

Cellobiase enzyme from Aspergillus
niger and Cellulase enzyme produced from Trichoderma reesei ATCC 26921 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). All enzymes were stored at 4 °C until use for hydrolysis. Cellulase
and cellobiase (β-glucosidase) activities were 700 and 250 U/g, as provided by the
supplier.

Citrate buffer was made from anhydrous citric acid (Fisher
Scientific) and sodium citrate dehydrate (Research Organics Inc). pH was measured
using a Mettler-Toledo pH meter. Sodium azide, 0.5 % (w/v), was obtained from
Ricca Chemical Company and used as received.

Pretreatment procedure
EDA pretreatment
Figure 1 shows a
schematic pretreatment diagram. Miscanthus and EDA were placed inside a batch
pressure reactor (Moline Parr Instruments) with a capacity of ca.
20 cm3. One gram of miscanthus was added to a
variable amount of EDA to achieve the desired miscanthus-to-EDA ratio for a
particular pretreatment. Deionized milli-Q water was subsequently added until
the total net weight of the solid–solvents mixture was 8 g. If the pretreatment
used gaseous ammonia, the mixture was pressurized with 10 bar ammonia.Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of pretreatment process



The reactor was placed in a temperature-controlled oil bath at
180 °C for 30 min. The reactor was then removed from the bath and cooled to room
temperature. If the reactor contained ammonia, the ammonia was flashed after
cooling.

The slurry was filtered. The liquid phase (EDA, water and
dissolved biomass) was collected using vacuum filtration and stored for
composition analysis. The remaining solid phase (recovered solid) was washed
with water until pH 7 was achieved.

For each pretreatment condition, the pretreatment was replicated
five times. Chemical composition analysis was done in triplicate, and enzymatic
hydrolysis was done in duplicate, all with good reproducibility.

Auto-hydrolysis
Auto-hydrolysis experiments were carried out in the batch
reactors mentioned in the previous section. Miscanthus-to-water ratio was set to
1:8 (w/w) and the pretreatment was carried out for 30 min at 180 °C. After 30
min, the slurry was cooled to room temperature, filtered using Whatman 41 filter
paper to separate the liquid from the solid. The solid was dried in an oven at
105 °C for 12 h. The liquid was stored for chemical composition analysis. The
chemical composition analysis of the solid followed the NREL protocol summarized
here and in our previous publications (Padmanabhan et al. 2011; Rodriguez et al. 2011; Sluiter et al. 2010a, b).

Aqueous Ammonia
1 g of 4-mm-particle miscanthus and 10 gm of 5 or 30 % aqueous
ammonia were placed in the pressurized autoclave. After 30 min at 180 °C, the
miscanthus + ammonia slurry was cooled to room temperature prior to solid–liquid
separation by filtration.

Chemical composition analysis of untreated and pretreated solid
miscanthus
Analysis of untreated and pretreated miscanthus followed the
protocols mentioned in recent publication of Ibáñez and Bauer (2014). This method is essentially a modification
of NREL protocol to accommodate smaller size samples (Sluiter et al. 2010a, b; Templeton et al. 2010). The details of the protocols can be found in the
publication of Ibáñez and Bauer (2014). A brief summary of the method employed is summarized here.
The original and the recovered solid were dried in an oven at 105 °C at
atmospheric pressure overnight until its dry weight did not change. The mass of
the solid was then measured using a Mettler-Toledo electronic weighing balance
with a precision of ±0.0001 g.

To obtain a material balance, amounts of cellulose, hemicellulose,
and lignin present in the recovered solid were determined based on products
obtained from acid hydrolysis. Three 50-mg samples of the dried solid were placed
in separate 17-mL glass autoclave tubes. Half a milliliter of 72 %
H2SO4 aqueous solution was then
added to each tube. The hydrolysis was allowed to proceed for 1 h at room
temperature. Brief vortexing with a Fisher Scientific digital vortex mixer was
done every 10 min during the reaction to improve solid–liquid contact. After 1 h,
14 mL of water were added to reduce the acid concentration to 4 wt%. The tubes
were then autoclaved at 121 °C and 1.38 bar for 1 h. The contents of the tube were
cooled prior to filtration using glass filters (Millipore, Ireland).

The liquid phase from acid hydrolysis contained sugars and minor
amounts of degradation products, mainly furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF), in addition to any acid-soluble lignin. The solid residue contained
acid-insoluble lignin and ash.

A one-milliliter aliquot of the liquid filtrate was filtered again
using a 200-nm filtering disc and then analyzed using a Shimazdu HPLC equipped
with a 300-mm × 7.8 mm Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and a
refractive-index detector. The mobile phase was
0.001 N–H2SO4 aqueous solution at
a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The injection volume was 20 μL. The concentrations of
sugars and degradation products were determined using previously established
calibration curves.

The cellulose content in the original or recovered miscanthus was
calculated from the concentrations of glucose and HMF. The hemicellulose content
was calculated from the concentrations of xylose, arabinose, acetate, and
furfural. These calculations followed the standard NREL analytical
procedure.

The acid-soluble-lignin content is determined by analyzing the
ultraviolet absorbance of the liquid filtrate at 205 nm using an Agilent 8453
UV–Vis spectrophotometer. An aliquot of the filtrate was diluted as needed (such
that the absorbance was in the range 0.3–0.7) and placed in quartz cuvettes. The
percent acid-soluble lignin was calculated from 1 Percentacidsolublelignin=(Absorbanceat205nm)×(Dilutionfactor)×(Volumeoffiltrate,14.545mL)(Culettepathlength,1cm)×(Absorptivityat205nm)×(Massofsolidhydrolyzed)×100 

The acid-insoluble lignin is the difference between the dry weight
of solid residue from acid hydrolysis and its weight after it was ashed. To
calculate the dry weight, the solid residue after filtering the autoclaved
contents was oven-dried at 105 °C overnight; this weight was recorded. The dried
solid was then placed in aluminum pans of known mass. The pan is then placed in a
furnace and ashed by raising the temperature to 575 °C for 3–4 h. The aluminum
pans had previously been ashed using the same thermal treatment to avoid errors
due to residual organic substances on the pan. The percent acid-insoluble lignin
was calculated from 2 Percent acid insoluble lignin=Mass before ashing-Mass after ashingMass of solid hydrolyzed×100 The total lignin content is the sum of the acid-soluble and
acid-insoluble lignin.

Enzymatic hydrolysis
The washed recovered solid was placed in a 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask.
For 1 g of recovered biomass, 50 mL of citrate buffer solution (50 mM, 4.8–5.0
pH), 4.00 mL sodium azide solution (0.5 % w/v), was added to the Erlenmeyer flask.
The purpose of sodium azide is to inhibit any microbial growth during enzyme
hydrolysis. Cellulase and β-glucosidase were added at a loading of 20 FPU (Filter
Paper Unit) per gram of cellulose. Cellulase measurement units (FPU) were
determined according to the procedure described by Ghose (1987). Enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted at
50 °C in an Innova 44-series incubator with shaking at 150 revolutions per minute.
The pH of the system was maintained in the range of 4.8–5.0, which is considered
as the optimal conditions for cellulase enzymes (Ghose 1987). Aliquots of 200 μL of supernatant were
taken after 72 h. Each aliquot was diluted by a factor of two and analyzed using a
Shimadzu HPLC.

Conversions of cellulose to glucose and hemicellulose to xylose are
calculated using Eqs. 3 and 4. We report conversions for the pretreated solid
miscanthus, excluding what dissolved in the aqueous phase. 3 Percent cellulose conversion=Glucose concentrationmgmL×hydrolysis volumemL×0.9Cellulosemgin the pretreatedmiscanthus×100 

In the above equation, the constant 0.9 accounts for hydration of
cellulose to produce glucose. 4 Percent hemicellulose conversion=Xylose concentrationmgmL×hydrolysis volumemL×0.88Hemicellulosemgin the pretreatedmiscanthus×100 

In Eq. (4), the constant
0.88 accounts for hydration of hemicellulose to produce xylose.

Additional production of glucose and xylose (not studied here) can
be obtained from cellulose and hemicellulose in aqueous EDA stream.

Results and discussion
Effect of EDA with and without ammonia on delignification of
miscanthus
Delignification of miscanthus after pretreatment is calculated
from: 5 Percent delignification =Lignin content in untreated solid -lignin content in pretreated solid×recovery100lignin content in untreated solid×100 

Figure 2 and
Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of EDA on delignification of miscanthus with
and without ammonia. Compared to hot-water pretreated miscanthus, addition of EDA
leads to significant lignin removal. As expected, increasing concentration of EDA
leads to higher delignification. When the miscanthus-to-EDA mass ratio is 1:0.5,
nearly 58 % delignification is achieved. Higher miscanthus-to-EDA ratio (1:3)
raises lignin removal to approximately 72 %. Because EDA has appreciable hydrogen
basicity, it provides delignification larger than those using conventional polar
solvents (Ishikura 2011; Padmanabhan
et al. 2012). Our previous work on
solubility studies of miscanthus using COSMO-RS (conductor-like screening
model–real solvents) indicated that ammonia, amines and EDA favor interactions
with the phenolic-OH group of lignin due to their strong hydrogen-bond basicity
(Rodriguez et al. 2011; Padmanabhan
et al. 2011). This basicity
contributes to better solubilization and removal of lignin.Fig. 2 Comparison of delignification of miscanthus from different
pretreatment methods at 180 °C for 30 min. Uncertainty in delignification
is ±5 %

aFor aqueous EDA (EDA + Water), the total
solvent-to-miscanthus ratio is 8:1 while miscanthus-to-EDA ratio is also
indicated. Ratio of miscanthus to ammonia is approximately 1:0.25,
calculated on basis of autoclave volume, temperature and
pressure



Figure 2 also shows that
delignification of miscanthus with EDA and ammonia is nearly the same as that of
EDA without ammonia. About 75 % of lignin is removed upon addition of ammonia to
1:3 mass ratio of miscanthus to EDA. Because there is no significant improvement
in delignification upon addition of ammonia, EDA alone appears to be sufficient
for good lignin removal.

Comparison of EDA delignification with delignification using hot water or
aqueous ammonia
Figure 2 shows the extent
of delignification of miscanthus using: (a) auto-hydrolysis, (b) aqueous ammonia
and (c) EDA (with and without ammonia). The extent of delignification for EDA
pretreatment is nearly same as that using aqueous ammonia for pretreatment of
miscanthus and other biomass feedstock (Kurakake et al. 2001; Wyman et al. 2009; Boonmanumsin et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2009). Delignification results obtained here are comparable to
those reported elsewhere for alkaline pretreatment (Wang et al. 2004, 2012; Elander et al. 2009; Gupta and Lee 2010; Tao et al. 2011; Park et al. 2010). Our previously reported work on pretreatment of miscanthus
using aqueous ammonia (10, 20 and 30 %) achieves nearly 75 % delignification (Liu
et al. 2013).

Figure 2 shows that both
aqueous ammonia and EDA provide similar delignification despite different chemical
mechanisms. For aqueous ammonia, the OH− nucleophile is
responsible for the breaking of lignin–carbohydrate interactions, whereas for EDA
the interaction mostly follows from the two NH2 groups
present in the diamine.

Figure 2 suggests that
hot-water pretreatment alone is not sufficient to remove a significant amount of
lignin. Only 10–12 % delignification was achieved with the hot-water pretreatment
at 180º C, consistent with results reported by others (Ingram et al. 2011b; Wyman et al. 2011). Ingram et al., and Wormeyer et al., have
compared lignin removal efficiency of hot water versus organosolv pretreatment for
wheat straw feedstock (Wormeyer et al. 2011; Ingram et al. 2011a, b). Their
studies confirm that organosolv pretreatment is more efficient than hot water for
lignin removal.

Low and high loading of EDA gives delignification similar to that
reported in our previous work on binary solvent mixtures of EDA with a polar
organic solvent or an ionic liquid (Padmanabhan et al. 2012). Previous work, however, used higher
loadings of EDA and a smaller miscanthus particle size (80 μm). In this study,
with an eye toward economic process design, we have explored delignification using
low-to-high loadings of EDA with larger miscanthus particle size (4 mm).

Delignification of miscanthus in aqueous EDA may be due to a
reaction that decreases the molecular weight of lignin (Helmy and Aboustate
1993). Several alkaline
pretreatment studies suggest that addition of alkali prevents repolymerization of
lignin oligomers (Jahan and Farouqui 2000; Wang et al. 2010; Sarwar et al. 2001; Rodriguez and Jimenez 2008). Addition of ammonia or EDA to hot water leads to better
solubilization of lignin in the liquid alkaline phase (Jahan and Farouqui
2002; Sun et al. 2010).

Enzymatic hydrolysis of EDA-pretreated miscanthus
Figure 3 shows results of
enzymatic hydrolysis following three different pretreatments. For comparison,
Fig. 3 also presents results for
enzymatic hydrolysis of raw untreated miscanthus. As expected, untreated
miscanthus shows very low conversion of carbohydrates to fermentable sugars, even
after 1 week. Our studies show, once again, that pretreatment is necessary to
break the recalcitrance of miscanthus for enzymatic hydrolysis to sugars.Fig. 3 Percent conversion of cellulose and hemicellulose to
corresponding glucose and xylose following enzymatic hydrolysis of
pretreated miscanthus. Conversions are based on the recovered solid
miscanthus. Refer Table 1 for the
composition of recovered solid miscanthus. Uncertainty in conversion is
±3 %



Auto-hydrolysis pretreatment without alkali gives only minor
conversion of cellulose to glucose after 72 h. The conversion is only about 20 %.
This low conversion indicates that alkali is necessary to achieve the structural
changes in cellulose required for significant delignification.

Pretreatment of miscanthus with EDA at various loadings with or
without ammonia gives much better enzymatic hydrolysis compared to that for
untreated or hot-water pretreated miscanthus. There is a strong correlation
relating higher EDA loadings for improved conversion to glucose and xylose. A
higher ratio of miscanthus to EDA corresponds to higher pH. As the EDA loading
increases from 0.5:1 to 3:1(keeping temperature constant), enzymatic conversion
improves from 27 to 63 % after 72 h.

The observed increase in conversion to sugars probably follows from
higher delignification that enhances accessibility of enzymes to cellulose and
hemicellulose. However, removal of lignin alone may not be sufficient for higher
enzymatic conversions; probably, it is also important to bring changes in the
structure of cellulose and to remove hemicellulose. Addition of ammonia to EDA
does not appear to produce significant increase in sugar yield after enzyme
hydrolysis.

The Tables 1 and
2 show that about one-half of the
hemicellulose is retained in the recovered solid while the other half is dissolved
in the liquid phase. Hemicellulose in the recovered solid may limit the
accessibility of Cellulase enzymes. Hemicellulose oligomers provide a barrier to
Cellulase enzymes, as shown by Wymann and coworkers (Qing and Wyman 2011; Kumar and Wyman 2009). Their results show that either addition
of supplemental Xylanase enzymes or removal of hemicellulose raises the conversion
of cellulose to glucose.

Although special hemicellulase enzymes were not added in our work,
we nevertheless observed production of xylose. Some hemicellulase (xylanase)
enzymes are present in the Celluclast enzyme cocktail even after purification, as
indicated by the supplier. Similar to that of glucose, xylose yield rises upon
increasing the loading of EDA. Upon raising EDA loading from 0.5:1 to 3:1,
hemicellulose to xylose conversion increases from 33 to 55 % after 72 h. For
auto-hydrolysis, hemicellulose to xylose conversion rate is same as that of
cellulose to glucose. The presence of hemicellulose and lignin may perhaps be
limiting the conversion rate. On the other hand, for ammonia alone treatment as
well as for EDA with and without treatment, hemicellulose to xylose conversion
rate raises with increase in the loadings of either ammonia or EDA. This perhaps
confirms the observation that removal of hemicellulose as well as lignin may help
achieve enzyme conversion.

Conclusion
EDA provides an effective pretreatment for miscanthus, leading to
good lignin removal and enhanced sugar yield by enzyme hydrolysis. Up to 75 % of
lignin is removed leading to a yield of 63 % glucose and 62 % xylose from the
recovered solid. The delignification efficiency of EDA pretreatment is high compared
to that for hot-water pretreatment and is nearly as efficient as that obtained for
aqueous-ammonia pretreatment. Addition of ammonia to EDA does not increase enzymatic
conversion to sugars despite more removal of lignin and hemicellulose. Increasing
EDA loading provides improved conversion of cellulose to sugars. Chemical
composition analysis shows that better lignin removal improves sugar yields. About
one-half of hemicellulose is removed from the solid during pretreatment; it is
dissolved in the liquid phase, where, following adjustments to lower pH, it can be
converted to xylose.
