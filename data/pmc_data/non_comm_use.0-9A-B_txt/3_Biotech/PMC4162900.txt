developed, followed by comparative acetylcholinesterase inhibitory (AChEI) activity
assay of the in vitro raised and conventionally grown plants. The use of AChEI
activity is the most accepted strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Fully
expanded, mature leaves were cut into different segments to initiate the cultures.
The middle section of the leaf in vertical orientation with cut portion inserted
inside the medium was found most suitable for direct shoot regeneration. Leaf
explants responded with nearly consistent frequency (60–66.67 %) throughout the
year. To obtain high frequency response with enhanced shoot multiplication rate, 32
plant growth regulator regimes were screened amongst which benzylaminopurine at
5.0 mg/l was found most suitable, yielding 100 % response and maximum number of
shoots per explant (7.93); same concentration was also most supportive for repeated
multiplication (6.53 shoots). The quality of the shoots and multiplication rate
could be significantly enhanced (24.35 shoots) when adenine sulphate, glutamine and
phloroglucinol, in an optimised concentration, were additionally supplemented. The
clonal nature of the micropropagated plants was confirmed by random amplified
polymorphic DNA analysis. A comparative analysis of AChEI activity was carried out
amongst the methanolic extracts of stem segments of the mother plant, randomly
selected seedlings of different age (4 and 6 months old) of the same mother plant
and randomly selected micropropagated plants of different age (3 and 6 months age).
The mother plant sample showed effective AChEI activity, with
IC50 of 66.46 μg/ml while seedlings, of different age
groups, performed poorly (6-month-old seedlings, Se-16M,
yielded IC50 of 20,538.46 μg/ml, while two randomly selected
4 months’ aged seedlings, Se-24M and
Se-34M exhibited IC50 of 19,341.03
and 24,281.70 μg/ml). On the other hand, various micropropagated plants, 2 of
3 months (MiP-13M, MiP-23M) and 2 of
6 months (MiP-36M and MiP-46M) age
behaved like the mother plant, exhibiting IC50 values of
71.87, 72.91, 67.65 and 69.65 μg/ml, respectively.

Introduction
Ficus religiosa, the Sacred Fig or Bo-Tree,
belonging to family Moraceae, is a large heavily branched tree with long petiolated,
heart-shaped leaves. The tree is native to India and Nepal where it has great
ethano-medicinal and religious importance since times immemorial. Different parts of
the tree render applications for more than 50 disorders, which are well documented
in Ayurveda, the indigenous Indian medicine system (Singh et al. 2011). Many of these have been confirmed by
various pharmacological studies (Kirana et al. 2009; Pandit et al. 2010). One of the most affective and popular use of F. religiosa is in the
treatment of cognitive decline, improving memory and related central nervous system
disorders (Singh and Goel 2009). A
number of traditional practitioners in north India prepare specific herbal
formulations from stem bark of F. religiosa for
treatment of memory loss and various neuro-degenerative disorders (Personal
communication). The scientific basis for this was revealed by Vinutha et al.
(2007), who while analysing the
methanolic stem bark extract of F. religiosa,
found potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitory (AChEI) activity associated with it.
The latter is the most accepted strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD)
and other related diseases (Bertaccini 1982); the inhibitors prolong the half-life of acetylcholine
through inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) (Darvesh et al. 2003). Since, the present day drugs for AD
(tacrine, donepezil, rivastigime and galanthamine) are suffering with
short-half-lives and/or unfavourable side effects such as hepatotoxicity, low
bioavailability, adverse cholinergic side effects and a narrow therapeutic window
(Sancheti et al. 2009), F. religiosa is being
looked upon as a potential source of a new drug for AD. The phytochemical analysis
of bark and stem of F. religiosa has led to the
isolation of phytosterols, amino acids, furanocoumarins, phenolic components,
flavonoids, saponins and acid detergent fibres (Ambike and Rao 1967; Swami et al. 1989; Swami and Bisht 1996); however, those responsible for AChEI activity are yet to be
identified. There is a need to characterise and exploit the AChEI activity found in
the stem bark of F. religiosa at the commercial level. Conventionally, the tree is
propagated by seeds, which remain viable for a few months and the plants produced
are not true to types. The vegetative propagation by cutting is not efficient under
varied climatic conditions. The nature and amount of secondary metabolites in
different parts of the plants is greatly affected by the environmental condition and
so naturally propagated plants are unable to yield consistent yield of secondary
metabolites throughout the year (Gurel et al. 2011; Tamara et al. 2011). Micropropagation is a proven method for large-scale
production of true-to-type medicinal plants capable of yielding desired
plant-derived pharmaceuticals with consistent quality and amount (Pattnaik and Chand
1996; Jiang et al. 2012). In vitro propagation methods also offer the
opportunity to correlate the secondary metabolite production with several parameters
like nutritional and hormonal composition of nutrient medium, growth conditions,
duration of culture, etc., and so are better for production of plants for
commercial, pharmaceutical applications (Gurel et al. 2011).

Some previous work on in vitro propagation of F.
religiosa L. using nodal segments as explants has been carried out by
Jaiswal and Narayan (1985), Deshpande
et al. (1998), and Hassan et al.
(2009). In an attempt to further
improve the micropropagation protocol (Siwach and Gill 2011), it was observed that response of nodal
segments as well as frequency of contamination under in vitro conditions was
strongly influenced by the season of explants collection, restricting the culture
initiation experiment to a particular time-period of the year (Siwach et al.
2011). Similar observations were also
observed with apical shoot explants (data not shown). The seasonal influence on the
establishment and response of in vitro cultures of perennial trees is due to their
periodic development and is one of the major hurdles towards commercialisation of
micropropagation for these plants as it cannot be overcome by environmental or
nutritional manipulations (Siril and Dhar 1997; McCown 2000).

Therefore, a need was felt to formulate a commercially viable micropropagation
protocol for F. religiosa L., which would be
beyond the seasonal constraints. Axillary and apical meristematic cells (on the
nodal and apical explants respectively), of the perennial trees, are genetically
directed to divide actively during the active growth season, and this periodic
growth direction may not be there with the differentiated tissues like leaves. There
exists one study reporting the use of leaves as explants for in vitro propagation of
F. religiosa
(Narayan and Jaiswal 1986). However,
the study pertains to indirect shoot organogenesis from leaves through the callus
phase and does not discuss about the seasonal influence on the in vitro response of
leaves’ explants. So during the present study, experiments were initiated with fully
expanded mature leaf segments to optimise season independent protocol for F. religiosa. It was
planned to go specifically for direct shoot regeneration followed by confirming the
clonal nature of plants by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) based molecular
analysis. The latter has been reported as a reliable method for monitoring the
genetic stability of micropropagated plants in many species (Khan and Spoor
2001). To explore the pharmaceutical
potential of micropropagated plants, present study was extended to carry out
comparative AChE inhibitory activity assay among the stem tissue of randomly
selected micropropagated plants, randomly selected seedlings of the same mother
plant and mother plant itself.

Materials and methods
Plant materials
Fully grown, healthy looking leaves were excised from third to sixth node from
the tip of a healthy branch of a 45–50-year-old tree of F.
religiosa L., selected as the mother plant (MP) for the present
study, growing near the campus area of Chaudhary Devi Lal University, Sirsa,
Haryana, India. The leaves were kept for 15 min under running tap water to remove
the traces of dust and were surface sterilised as described earlier (Siwach and
Gill 2011). The surface sterilised
leaves were used as explants for direct shoot regeneration in the present
study.

Seeds of the same mother plant were also sown in the month of March (seeds are
available during months of March to June in North India) under greenhouse
conditions and were properly taken care of. Among various seedlings so obtained,
three seedlings of different ages were randomly selected. One seedling was of
6 months age (named as Se-16m) while other two were of
4 months age (named as Se-24M and
Se-34M). These three seedlings were used for comparison
with micropropagated plants in different analysis, reported below.

Effect of explant orientation on shoot organogenesis
The surface sterilised leaves, as obtained above, were cut into three
sections—proximal section with petiole, middle section and distal section with
leaf tip. Each section was further cultured in three orientations-cut portion
inserted in medium, adaxial surface touching the medium and abaxial surface
touching the medium. Murashige and Skoog’s medium (1962), (MS) supplemented with 1.0 mg/l benzylaminopurine (BAP)
was used for this experiment. The number of explants initiating shoot buds
(percentage of response) and the average number of shoot buds per explant was
recorded after 28 days of culture. The explants with sprouted shoot buds/shoots
were shifted to the same medium as such within an interval of 30 days so as to
score the number of shoots and the length of shoots after 60 days of initial
culture (Table 1). Every treatment
contained ten replicates and the experiment was repeated thrice. These experiments
were carried out during January–February, 2009.Table 1 Effect of different orientations of various cut leaf sections of

Using the most suitable orientation of the leaf segments as obtained from
above experiment, following two studies were carried out in parallel.

Effect of season of explant collection on percentage of response of
explants
The cut leaf segments, in the most suitable orientation as deduced from
above experiment, were cultured every month from March 2009–February 2010. The
MS basal medium supplemented with 1.0 mg/l BAP was employed for this study.
There were 20 replicates for each month and the observations were recorded after
4 weeks of culture.

Effect of plant growth regulators on direct shoot regeneration
It was carried out during the period of March–July, 2009. The cut leaf
sections in most suitable orientation as obtained above were inoculated on MS
medium supplemented with various concentrations and combinations of BAP,
thidiazuron (TDZ) and indole acetic acid (IAA). The observations were made for
shoot organogenesis as reported above (Table 2). For each of these treatments, 20 explants were used and the
experiment was repeated thrice.Table 2 Effect of various concentrations and combinations of BAP, TDZ
and IAA on shoot organogenesis from leaf explants

AExtensive callus formation,
Bobserved after 60 days of
culture



Shoot multiplication during sub-culturing
The shoots regenerated from leaf explant were excised from the explant surface
and were cultured in cluster of 2–3 shoots on six different medium. MS medium
having most suitable PGR regime deduced from above study was taken as control. Two
more concentrations of the selected PGR, lower than that in control, were also
screened. These three media were further modified with specific combination of
three additives—glutamine (200 mg/l), adenine sulphate (ADS) (150 mg/l) and
phloroglucinol (100 mg/l), which was earlier reported to support the shoot
proliferation during repeated sub-culturing (Siwach and Gill 2011). Observations were recorded after 35 days
of culture (Table 3). For each of the
above treatment, 20 replicates were used and the experiment was repeated
thrice.Table 3 Effect of different concentrations of BAP, with or without

In vitro rooting, acclimatisation and transplantation
Individual shoots were subjected to in vitro rooting, acclimatisation and
transplantation as reported previously (Siwach and Gill 2011).

Culture conditions
MS medium, modified with different growth regulators as per requirement as
reported above, was supplemented with 3 % (w/v) sucrose and solidified with 0.8 %
(w/v) agar. The pH of medium was adjusted to 5.8 using 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N HCl,
before autoclaving at 15 kg/cm2 and 121 °C for 20 min.
The cultures were maintained at 25 ± 2 °C, at a photoperiod of 16 h
(80 μmol m−2 s−1) in a
culture room.

Checking the clonal fidelity of micropropagated plants
Six micropropagated plants, of different age (1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 months aged,
after transplantation) were randomly selected for this. Three
seedlings-Se-16M, Se-24M and
Se-34M, discussed above in the “Plant material” sub-section, were also selected to check their
clonal fidelity. Mother plant sample was taken as reference sample. Young leaves
were excised from the above listed ten samples and were subjected to DNA isolation
using Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method (Sanghai-Maroof et al.
1984). Qualitative and quantitative
assessment of total genomic DNA was carried out by spectrophotometer as well as
agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by DNA purification.

Twenty RAPD primers, procured from Bangalore Genie Pvt. Ltd., were used for
amplification (Table 4). Polymerase Chain
Reaction (PCR) was carried out in a total volume of 15 μl with each reaction tube
comprising of 8.1 μl of PCR water, 1.5 μl of PCR buffer containing
MgCl2 (10X), 2.4 μl of dNTPs mixture (5 mM), 1.2 μl of
primers (10 μM), 1.5 μl (10 ng/μl) of template DNA, and 0.3 μl of Taq DNA polymerase. Amplification was carried out using
Bio-Rad thermal-cycler and was run for 35 cycles; each cycle consisting of a
denaturation step at 94 °C (1 min), a primer annealing step at 36 °C (1 min)
followed by amplification at 72 °C (3 min). Amplified products were loaded on
1.5 % agarose gel along with 100 bp ladder (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and
electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V. Gel was stained with 25 μg/ml ethidium
bromide and photographed on a Gel Documentation Polaroid system (Bio-Rad).Table 4 Amplification profile obtained with selected 20 RAPD primers,

Sample preparation for AChE inhibitory activity assay
Mother plant sample (MP) was taken as reference for this. Four micropropagated
plants of different age (two plants after 3 months of
transplantation—MiP-13M and
MiP-23M, and two plants after 6 months of
transplantation—MiP-36M and
MiP-46M) were randomly selected. Three
seedlings—Se-16M, Se-24M and
Se-34M were also taken for AChEI activity assay. The MP
selected was of 45–50 years old, the age when higher secondary metabolites are
reported to be present in stem bark. On the other hand, the other plants selected
were of 3–6 months age as reported above. So to avoid the huge difference in the
development stage of these plants, young, fresh, thin branches of mother plant was
taken as sample (Fig. 1a) instead of stem
bark or older branches. Likewise for seedlings and micropropagated plants also,
young branches were excised (Fig. 1b).
After excision, young branches were defoliated and cut into small-sized pieces
followed by thorough washing with sterilised double distilled water. These were
then dried in an oven at 32 °C. The dried pieces were finely ground to a fine
powder using mixer grinder. The 15 g of dried fine powder of each sample was
macerated separately with HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) grade
methanol (75 ml) at room temperature for 24 h. The extracts were obtained by
filtration using Whatman No. 1 filter paper and concentrated to dryness. Working
concentrations of methanolic extracts of each of the eight samples were prepared
by completely dissolving the dried extract in methanol in ratio 1:1 to have stock
solution of strength 1 mg/ml.Fig. 1 Source of stem tissue (for methanolic extract preparation).

AChE inhibitory activity assay
For each of the eight samples, five dilutions of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 μg/ml
concentration were prepared. The assay for measuring AChEI activity was modified
from the method described by Ellman et al. (1961) and Ingkaninan et al. (2000). Briefly, 4 μl of 3 mM dithiobis nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB),
20 μl of 15 mM acetylthiocholine iodide (ATCI), 130 μl Tris–HCl and 20 μl of each
diluted sample was taken and added to the wells of microplate, followed by 50 μl
of 0.28 U/ml AChE enzyme. The microplate was then read at 405 nm every 5 s for
2 min by a CERES micoplate reader (Spectra Max Plus 384, Molecular Devices,
SoftMax Pro 5 S·No. SMP500-16135-DPVW). Mean absorbance per minute (A) was calculated for each dilution of different
samples. Each plate had one blank well and one control well also. Percentage of
inhibition of enzyme activity by a given concentration of sample was calculated by
using the formula: Per cent inhibition=Acontrol-Aextract/Acontrol×100 

The percentage of inhibition obtained above was plotted vs. corresponding
concentration of the extract of each sample. There were three replicates for each
diluted concentration. The experiment was repeated for two more times.

Calculating the IC50 value of each sample
The obtained graph of each sample fitted perfectly in Logarithmic curve shape
and was subjected to regression analysis using logarithmic equation. The
IC50 value (i.e. the concentration at which the enzyme
activity is inhibited by 50 %) was calculated with the obtained equation.

Statistical analysis
The experiments were set up in completely randomised design (CRD). The data
were analysed by Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan multiple range
test (DMRT). Data analysis was carried out by using SPSS version 18.

Results
Effect of explant orientation on shoot organogenesis
The leaf sections, in all the orientations, exhibited shoot-buds formation
after 17–20 days of culture. Of the three types of cut leaf sections, middle
section of the leaf performed better than the proximal or distal sections in each
orientation (Table 1). Middle section
responded with maximum frequency (63.33 %) in vertical orientation with cut
portion inserted inside the medium, which was not significantly different to that
obtained with horizontal orientation with adaxial surface (60.00 %) or abaxial
surface (56.67 %) touching the medium (Table 1). Significantly higher number of shoots buds (4.83) which
proliferated into equally higher number of shoots (4.57) with considerably more
lengths (2.67 cm) was obtained with middle section of leaf in vertical orientation
(Table 1). Distal sections and proximal
sections responded poorly (40 % or less than it) in all the three orientations.
Regardless of the nature and orientation, shoots originated from the cut ends of
leaf segments having direct contact with the medium (Fig. 2a–c).Fig. 2 Induction of shoot buds/shoots from middle section of leaf
cultured in; a vertical orientation with
one cut end inserted inside the medium, bar 0.4 cm; b horizontal
orientation with adaxial surface touching medium, bar 0.7 cm; c horizontal
orientation with abaxial surface touching the medium, bar 0.7 cm



Middle section of the leaves with cut portion inside the medium was selected
for the subsequent studies and here onwards it will be referred as explant/leaf
explant.

Effect of season on shoot organogenesis from leaf explant
With the same medium condition, percentage of response of leaf explant varied
from a maximum of 66.67 % (during the months of April, May, June, October and
December) to a minimum of 60 % (during the months of February, March, September,
November), the difference being statistically non-significant (Fig. 3a). Further, the maximum number of shoot buds per
explant (4.86) was obtained for the month of June and this was not significantly
different to that obtained during rest of the months (Fig. 3b).Fig. 3 Effect of month of explant collection on; a percent response of explant; b average number of shoot buds per leaf explant (observed
after 28 days of culture)



Effect of plant growth regulators on direct shoot regeneration
Leaf explants responded differently to different concentrations of BAP and
TDZ. With increase in concentrations of BAP from 1.0 up to 5.0 mg/l, a continuous
increase in percentage of response was observed, maximum being on 5.0 mg/l
(100 %), afterwards the frequency decreased. On the other hand, with increase in
concentration of TDZ from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/l, percentage of response continuously
decreased; maximum was observed on 1.0 mg/l (63.33 %) (Table 2). Further, beyond 1.5 mg/l of TDZ, shoot
organogenesis was accompanied with extensive callus formation at the explant
surface.

Addition of IAA (0.5 mg/l) in the medium already containing BAP or TDZ, making
different combinations, significantly lowered the percentage of response
(Table 2). A decrease in the number of
shoot buds/shoots per explant, after addition of IAA to different concentrations
of BAP, was also observed except for the combination of 0.5 mg/l IAA with 1.0 mg/l
BAP which induced considerably higher number of shoots (7.27) per explant, though
the percentage of response was low (43.33 %). Addition of IAA to different
concentrations of TDZ induced a peculiar type of response, considerably higher
number of shoot buds (7.07–12.23) were observed per explant but these shoot buds
could not differentiate into full grown shoots.

Of the thirty-two PGR regimes screened, 5.0 mg/l BAP, besides supporting
maximum percent response (100 %), induced proliferation of maximum number of shoot
buds (5.83) (as observed after 4 weeks of culture) (Fig. 4a) which later on turned into maximum number of shoots (7.93)
with higher lengths (2.97 cm, on an average) (as observed after 60 days of initial
culture) (Fig. 4b) (Table 2). Comparable number of shoots (7.27) was obtained
on combination of 0.5 mg/l IAA with 1.0 mg/l BAP, but as percentage of response on
this particular combination was very low (43.33 %), this was not selected for
further studies.Fig. 4 Shoot organogenesis from middle section of the leaf in vertical
orientation, when cultured on MS medium having 5.0 mg/l BAP; a shoot buds as observed after 28 days of
culture, bar 0.6 cm; b shoots as observed after 60 days of initial
culture, bar 0.5 cm



Shoot multiplication during sub-culturing
The shoots so obtained, when excised from the explant and cultured in a
cluster of 2–3 shoots on the most suitable medium obtained above i.e. MS medium
having 5.0 mg/l BAP (control), mild chlorosis of leaves and stem as well as
curling and browning of leaves edges and early leaf fall (at low frequency) was
observed (Fig. 5a). Further, the number of
shoots obtained on this medium, at the end of fifth week, was also less (6.53)
(Table 3). Lowering of BAP concentration
to 2.5 and 1.0 mg/l further lowered the multiplication rate while health of shoots
remained poor (Table 3). To improve
quality of shoots as well as to enhance shoot multiplication rate, three additives
were added in optimal concentration (200 mg/l glutamine+ 150 mg/l ADS+ 100 mg/l
phloroglucinol); optimisation of these additives being discussed in our previous
report (Siwach and Gill 2011).
Supplementation of these additives to each of the three concentration of BAP
significantly increased the shoot multiplication rate as well as improved the
quality of the shoots (Table 3). Of the
three concentrations of BAP, significantly higher number of shoots (24.37) was
obtained when this combination of glutamine, ADS and phloroglucinol was
supplemented to 5.0 mg/l BAP (Fig. 5b)
indicating the suitability of higher cytokinin concentration even during repeated
sub-culturing. The shoots so obtained were isolated after 5 weeks of culture and
were sub-cultured on this medium and the process was repeated 4–5 times, before
subjecting the individual shoot to rooting.Fig. 5 Shoots multiplication during sub-culturing on; a MS medium having 5.0 mg/l BAP, bar 0.7 cm; b

In vitro rooting, acclimatisation and transplantation
The efficient in vitro rooting of the shoots, regenerated above, was obtained
on MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/l indole butyric acid (IBA) along with
0.1 mg/l IAA, with a frequency of 95 %, as discussed in earlier report (Siwach and
Gill 2011) (Fig. 6). The plantlets were successfully acclimatised
(Fig. 7) and transferred to field
conditions (Fig. 8) with a survival rate
of 90 % on conditions reported earlier (Siwach and Gill 2011).Fig. 6 In vitro rooting of micro-shoots obtained on semi-solid MS

Checking the clonal fidelity of micropropagated plants
Out of 20 RAPD primers, amplification with reproducible band pattern was
obtained with 13 (primers 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20); rest
seven primers either did not yield amplification or gave poor non-reproducible
band pattern (Table 4). With these
thirteen primers monomorphic band pattern was observed in the six randomly
selected micropropagated plants and the MP sample, which confirmed the clonal
nature of micropropagated plants (Table 4).

The selected three seedlings exhibited monomorphic band profile among
themselves as well as the MP and selected micropropagated plants, when amplified
with nine primers-3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19 and 20 (Table 4). With rest four primers (1, 2, 9, 11), the
seedlings yielded different band amplification profile. With primer 1,
Se-24M yielded monomorphic band pattern with MP (single
band of 500 bp), while one polymorphic band of 670 and 600 bp was observed for
Se-16M and Se-34M respectively.
With primer 2, a monomorphic band of 700 bp was observed in all the three
seedlings (monomorphic with MP and microproagated plants also), while polymorphic
band of 840 bp was observed for Se-16M. The MP and
micropropagate plants also yielded a band of 1,200 bp with primer 2 and this band
was absent in all the three seedlings. The amplification with primer 9 yielded 3
monomorphic bands of 240, 340, 440 bp size in MP, micropropagated plants,
Se-24M, and Se-34M, while two
polymorphic bands of 590 and 610 bp size were found only in the three seedlings,
while a polymorphic band of 300 bp was observed only in
Se-16M (Fig. 9).
Likewise, with primer 11, monorphic bands of sizes 350, 410, 600, 700 bp were
found in all the ten samples, polymorphic band of 150 bp was found in
Se-16M and Se-34M and polymorphic
band of 900 was observed only in Se-16M (Fig. 9).Fig. 9 A representative RAPD reaction for checking the clonal fidelity

AChE inhibitory assay
Different concentration of the extracts, of the selected eight samples (MP,
Se-16M, Se-24M,
Se-34M, MiP-13M,
MiP-23M, MiP-36M and
MiP-46M) inhibited the AChE enzyme by different degree,
as revealed by AChE inhibitory assay (Fig. 10). The inhibitions obtained with different samples could be
categorised in three groups: low (5–20 %), moderate (20–50 %) and good (50–100 %)
inhibition. MP exhibited low inhibition at low concentrations of 20 μg/ml
(15.35 %), moderate inhibition at 40 and 60 μg/ml (35.75 and 46.48 %,
respectively), while at concentration of 80 and 100 μg/ml, good inhibition of
55.80 and 61.58 %, respectively, was observed (Fig. 10a). The IC50 value obtained with the
mother plant sample was 66.49 μg/ml (Table 5). The 6 months’ aged seedlings (Se-16M)
exhibited very poor ability (<20 %) to inhibit AChE enzyme at all the
concentrations; the highest concentration of 100 μg/ml, could inhibit the AChE
enzyme by only 16.86 % (Fig. 10b). The
IC50 value obtained for Se was very high
(20,538.30 μg/ml) (Table 5). Similar
observations were made for two other seedlings of 4 months age;
IC50 for Se-24M and
Se-34M being 19,341.03 and 24,281.70 μg/ml, respectively.
Contrary to the seedlings, the plants obtained by micropropagation, showed very
effective AChE inhibitory activity. At each concentration, the methanolic extracts
of all the four selected micropropagated plants exhibited AChE inhibitory activity
quite similar to that obtained with MP; good inhibition (more than 50 %) was
observed at concentrations of 80 and 100 μg/ml (Fig. 10c–f). In fact, the four selected micropropagated plants,
MiP-13M, MiP-23M,
MiP-36M and MiP-46M exhibited
IC50 values of 71.87, 72.91, 67.65 and 69.65 μg/ml, which
was quite similar to that obtained with MP (66.49 μg/ml) (Table 5).Fig. 10 Logarithmic curves representing the percentage of inhibition of

Discussions
A highly efficient, season-independent, micropropagation protocol has been
developed for F. religiosa L. using leaf explants, followed by comparative AChE
inhibitory activity assay of the in vitro raised and conventionally grown plants,
for the first time during the present study.

A significant effect of nature and orientation of leaf segments was observed on
direct shoot organogenesis; middle section of leaves with cut end inserted inside
the medium was found most suitable (Table 1). The orientation of leaf explant has also been reported to play an
important role in the micropropagation of some other plants like Marion Blackberry
(Meng et al. 2004). In vitro response
of explants from woody perennials is reported to be strongly influenced by season of
explant collection (Debergh and Maene 1984; Debergh and Read 1991). Such an observation has also been reported for the nodal
explants of F. religiosa (Siwach et al. 2011). However, during the present study, the percentage of
response as well as average number of shoots buds per leaf explant was found nearly
consistent (with non-significant differences) during all the 12 months of the year
(Fig. 3). Such report, mentioning leaves
as explants with no seasonal constraints, did not exist previously for any other
plant species. One of the possible explanations is that the axillary and apical
meristematic cells, of the perennial trees, are genetically directed to divide
actively during the active growth season, and this periodic growth direction may not
be there with the differentiated tissues like leaves, though to conclude this fact,
more studies are needed.

The optimal PGR requirement for direct shoot regeneration from nodal segments of
F. religiosa
has been found different by different groups. Deshpande et al. (1998) reported 5 mg/l BAP as suitable for initial
bud break and 1.0 mg/l BAP as for further shoot proliferation, Hassan et al.
(2009) found 0.5 mg/l BAP in
combination with 0.1 mg/l IAA as most suitable while Siwach and Gill (2011) found combination of 1.0 mg/l BAP and
0.5 mg/l IAA best for shoot induction and multiplication. During the present study,
with leaves’ segments as explants, a different PGR requirement was observed for
direct shoot regeneration. Of the two cytokinins, BAP was found better than TDZ for
shoot induction and proliferation (Table 2).
Amongst various concentrations of BAP, alone as well as in combination with 0.5 mg/l
IAA, used during the present study, BAP at 5.0 mg/l was found most suitable for
percentage of response (100 %) as well as for inducing maximum number of shoots per
explant (7.93) (Table 2). The suitability of
higher level of BAP for shoot induction and proliferation from the leaf explant has
also been documented for Pipernigram (Ahmad et al. 2010) and Brassicarapa (Abbasi et al. 2011). Though combination of 1.0 mg/l BAP and 0.5 mg/l IAA also
induced considerably high number of shoots (7.27), it could not be considered as
suitable medium because of poor response (43.33 %). Induction of high number of
shoots on this particular medium could be attributed to low cytokinin to auxin ratio
but the reason for poor response on it could not be explained with present data and
literature available. The low cytokinin to auxin ratio has also been reported
earlier as the most suitable ratio for efficient shoot induction from the nodal
explants of F. religiosa (Hassan et al. 2009; Siwach and Gill 2011).

Addition of IAA in the medium having BAP or TDZ was found inhibitory for
percentage of response. Similar findings of inhibitory effect of combination of
auxin and cytokinin for shoot organogenesis frequency have also been reported for
some other plant species (Ahmad et al. 2010; Abbasi et al. 2011). Combination of IAA and TDZ was found very efficient in
initial shoot bud induction, however, these buds could not grow into shoots and
remained stunted. Similar observation was observed with TDZ alone in the medium,
during the direct shoot organogenesis from nodal explants of F. religiosa (Siwach and Gill
2011). TDZ is a substituted phenyl
urea (N-phenyl-1,2,3-thidiazol-5-yl urea) that
has immense potential as a cytokinin in shoot organogenesis in a large number of
plant systems, especially in the woody species (Mansouri and Preece 2009). On the other hand, some studies have
reported the negative impact of TDZ on shoot proliferation (Feng et al. 2010), however how this effect was further
augmented by addition of 0.5 mg/l IAA during the present study could not be
explained by the existing literature.

The shoots when excised from the explant and sub-cultured on same medium (BAP
5.0 mg/l) exhibited chlorosis of stem and leaves, curling and browning of leaves
edges as well as early leaf fall (Fig. 5a).
Such observations were also made during the shoot proliferation from nodal segments
of F. religiosa (Siwach and Gill 2011) as well as for some other plant species
(Husain et al. 2008). The suitability
of a particular combination of three additives (200 mg/l glutamine+ 150 mg/l ADS+
100 mg/l phloroglucinol) for overcoming these problems has been reported and
discussed well earlier (Siwach and Gill 2011). During present study, higher concentration of BAP (5.0 mg/l)
was also found supportive for shoot multiplication during repeated sub-culturing, as
compared to lower one (Table 3). This was
contrary to a general observation where cytokinin, at high concentration, favours
shoot induction while lowering of concentration is optimal for subsequent shoot
proliferation (Deshpande et al. 1998).

The protocol so developed as discussed above is different and more efficient
from the existing protocols for micropropagation of F. religiosa. Jaiswal and Narayan
(1985) have reported shoot
regeneration via indirect organogenesis through callus phase initiated from nodal
explants of F. religiosa, maximum number of 6–10 shoots being obtained from a callus
piece. Likewise Narayan and Jaiswal (1986) have reported differentiation of plantlets, 5–10 in number,
from leaf callus of F. religiosa. Micropropagation via the callus phase has chances of
somaclonal variations and so cannot be said to be clonal propagation. Direct shoot
regeneration in F.religiosa L. has been reported by Deshpande et al. (1998) and in their study, maximum of 5–6 shoots
were obtained from a single explant which may be considered as low regeneration rate
for a commercially efficient and economically viable micropropagation system.
Further no observation has been made for shoot multiplication during repeated
sub-culturing, no mention of any observation/problem common to tissue culture of
higher age woody perennials, has been made. Hassan et al. (2009) have reported a comparative high rate of
multiplication (10–15 shoots per explant) from nodal explants of F. religiosa but still
the study lacked the observations regarding health of the shoots during continuous
sub-culturing process. An efficient micropropagation protocol for F. religiosa, using
nodal segments as explants (giving 35 shoots per explant) was reported by us earlier
(Siwach and Gill 2011) but culture
initiation part had to be restricted to a particular time-period of the year as the
response of nodal segments was found to be strongly affected by the season of
explant collection (Siwach et al. 2011). The present study observed no effect of season on the in vitro
response of mature leaves segments of F.
religiosa and hence leaves were concluded as
suitable explants for obtaining season independent micropropagation protocol. Leaves
have been taken as explants for micropropagation of many other woody plant species
like Prunusserotina (Liu and Pijut 2008), Elaeocarpusrobustus (Rahman et al. 2003) but weather the response is affected by the season of leaf
explant collection has not been studied. Such a finding will be of great importance
for developing commercial micropropagation protocol of woody perennials.

The RAPD molecular marker analysis was found successful for checking the genetic
fidelity of plants, during the present study. Out of twenty primers, five primers
(primers 5, 6, 7, 15, 16) resulted in no amplification in all the samples probably
because of lack of formation of stable primer template structure during PCR
reaction. Two primers (8 and 10) did not yield stable and consistent amplification
profile for any of the selected samples indicating towards the redundancy of
complementary sites for these two primers. The 13 primers (primers 1, 2, 3, 4, 9,
11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20), which resulted in stable amplification in all the
samples, exhibited monomorphism among the selected micropropagated plants and MP
confirming the clonal nature of these plants. Out of these 13, amplification with
four primers (1, 2, 9, 11), exhibited polymorphism among seedlings and MP. Such an
observation supports the occurrence of genetic changes during gamete formation and
so confirms the propagation via seeds as non-clonal way of propagation. RAPD markers
have also been used successfully to assess genetic stability among micropropagated
plants of a number of species earlier e.g. Ribes
nigrum L. (Khan and Spoor 2001).

The 45–50 years old F. religiosa tree, used as mother plant during the present
study was found to possess higher AChE inhibitory activity
(IC50 of 66.49 μg/ml) than that reported for F. religiosa
(IC50 of 73.69 μg/ml) by Vinutha et al. (2007). It can be attributed to the difference in
the genotype, physiological state as well as environmental conditions between the
samples of the two studies.

The micropropagated plants of 3 and 6 months age were found to exhibit AChE
inhibitory activity quite similar to that of mother plant of 45–50 years age
(Fig. 10). Contrarily, seedling of the
6 months age and 4 months age exhibited very poor ability to inhibit AChE enzyme.
The normal course of development observed with perennial trees include the nil or
poor production of secondary metabolites during primary years of growth and
development and generally after 20–25 years of growth, secondary metabolites
synthesis is accelerated leading to higher level of these metabolites in different
parts of the tree (Kulkarni 2000). This
could explain the huge difference in the AChE inhibitory activity of the higher age
MP (IC50-66.49 μg/ml), 6 months old seedling
Se-16m (20,538.30 μg/ml) and 4 months old
seedlings—Se-24M (19,341.03 μg/ml),
Se-34M (24,281.70 μg/ml). The explants, when isolated from
the higher age plants, have secondary metabolic pathways genes in the active mode
(i.e. switched on state) and these genes generally remain in same state in the
plants, regenerated from these explants (Kulkarni 2000). So, in vitro raised plants (from explants of higher age
plant) start producing secondary metabolites much earlier than the plants obtained
by seed germination and are better source for pharmaceutical application (Gurel et
al. 2011; Rao et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2012). This is the possible explanation of obtaining higher AChE
inhibitory activity in the methanolic extracts of 3 and 6 months aged
micropropagated plants, compared to that in the 4 and 6 months old seedling. Such
observation is of great significance for exploiting the pharmaceutical applications
of F. religiosa towards AD treatment as it rules
out the need of waiting for so many years to let the plant start secondary
metabolites synthesis and hence avoids the issues of social, environmental and
religious concerns and gives an alternative for large scale commercial
production.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that the leaves explant can be a better
alternative to apical or nodal explants for developing a season independent
regeneration protocol. Higher concentration of BAP (5.0 mg/l) was most suitable for
direct shoot regeneration as well as shoot multiplication. During repeated
sub-culturing, the medium needed to be additionally supplemented with ADS
(150 mg/l), glutamine (200 mg/l) and phloroglucinol (100 mg/l) to overcome the
problems of chlorosis and leaf fall. The micropropagated plants were genetically
stable as was revealed by RAPD analysis of randomly selected plants of different
age. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory (AChEI) activity of micropropagated plants was
quite effective, similar to that of mother plant while 6 months old seedling
performed very poorly towards enzyme inhibition. The findings of present study give
an alternative source for exploiting AChEI activity at large scale and will be of
great use in developing new solutions to Alzheimer disease.
