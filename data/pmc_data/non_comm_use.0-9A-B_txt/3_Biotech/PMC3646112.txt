depleted their population in wild. Hence, for conserving this valuable germplasm,
short term in vitro storage of Protocorm-Like Bodies (PLBs) of D. nobile was carried out using different osmotica
(sucrose and mannitol). It was observed that incorporation of low sucrose and
mannitol (3 and 5 %) in the encapsulating matrix showed almost similar results with
that of control. In all these cases, more than half of PLBs burst out from the
matrix thus making these concentrations of sucrose and mannitol along with control
not suitable for storage studies. However, with the increase in concentration to 7.5
and 12.5 % in the encapsulating matrix, no outburst of encapsulated PLBs was
recorded till 60 days of storage; hence it can be concluded that these
concentrations play an important role in minimizing the growth of PLBs during
storage condition.

Introduction
Dendrobium nobile Lindl. is a medicinally
important epiphytic orchid and native to the states of North-east India, China,
Myanmar, Thailand and Nepal. Attractive flowers and the pattern of flowering (large
number of flowers per inflorescence) has made D.
nobile commercially important in the cut flower market (Martin and
Madassery 2006). Along with its
ornamental importance it have been used in the Chinese herbal drug industry for its
medicinal property (Ye et al. 2002).
The stems of this species are used as a tonic to improve digestion and for promoting
the production of body fluid (Anon 1999). However, anthropogenic pressures have rapidly decreased the
natural habitat of this species with the consequent reduction in the number of
plants. In the last two decades, in vitro techniques through micropropagation have
played a major role in propagation and conservation of a large number of threatened
plants (Dhar et al. 2000). However,
somaclonal variations are often observed during serial subcultures (Withers
1991). To avoid such variations in
vitro germplasm conservation strategy using in vitro storage technology has been
developed.

Synthetic seed technology is an exciting and rapidly growing area of research as
deals with in vitro conservation and storage of rare, endangered and desirable
genotypes along with its easy handling and transportation (Kumaria and Tandon
2001; Germana et al. 2011). In vitro conservation involves the
maintenance of explants in a pathogen-free environment for short - to medium- or
long-term (Engelmann and Engels 2002).
For short-term storage, the aim is to increase the interval between subcultures by
reducing growth. Minimum growth condition for short- to medium-term storage can be
followed in several ways, such as induction of osmotic stress with sucrose or
mannitol (Wescott 1981), reduced
temperature and/or light (Withers 1991)
and incorporation of sub-lethal levels of growth retardant (Gupta 2001). Storage through slow growth methods is
reproducible and widely applicable among different plant species and genotypes for
conservation of germplasm (Withers 1991). Elite germplasms of various rare and endangered plant species
like Coffea Arabica (Nassar 2003), Rauvolfia
tetraphylla (Faisal et al. 2006), Pterostylis saxicola and
Diuris arenaria (Sommrville et al. 2008), and Pogostemon
cablin (Kumara Swamy et al. 2009) have been stored by in vitro methods using this slow growth
technique. Roca et al. (1988) have
successfully shown that nodal cuttings from meristem-derived plantlets of cassava
(Maniht esculentum) could be maintained for
2 years on a medium with low osmotic concentration and activated charcoal. In Garlic
(Allium sativum), the shoot tips could be
stored for a period of 16 months following an increase in sucrose concentration to
10 % (El-Gizawy and Ford-Llyod 1987).

Though germplasm of many ornamental plants have also been successfully stored
using this minimal growth technology, a very few reports have been made for orchids,
viz. Vanilla planifolia (Divakaran et al.
2006), Vanda
coerulea (Sarmah et al. 2010), Cymbidium devonianum (Das
et al. 2011). Dubus (1980a, b) reported preservation of Cymbidium protocorms by increasing the sucrose concentration; however,
many other authors have reported maintaining the cultures at low temperatures for
storage and preservation (Sharma et al. 1992; Corrie and Tandon 1993; Datta et al. 1999; Das et al. 2008).
Das et al. (2011) reported that in case
of C. devonianum reduction in nutrient strength
in the encapsulated matrix as well as low temperature increases the storage
duration. However, the successful application of minimal growth technology requires
the establishment of specific protocols for each type of explants and species under
consideration (Watt et al. 2000). The
aim of the present study is to develop an effective and applicable protocol for the
short term in vitro storage of Protocorm-Like Bodies (PLBs) of D. nobile using different osmotica which is reported
first time in case of D. nobile.

Materials and methods
60-day-old PLBs of D. nobile were separated
into single PLB and blot dried. The PLBs were then encapsulated in 3 % sodium
alginate solution [dissolved in liquid MS medium containing different concentration
of osmotica (sucrose and mannitol) in a range of 0.0–15.0 % (w/v)]. These were then
singly dropped in 100 mM CaCl2·2H2O
solution (also prepared by dissolving in liquid MS medium containing different
concentration of sucrose and mannitol in the range as for sodium alginate). The
alginate beads containing the PLBs were held for at least 15–20 min to achieve
polymerization. The synthetic seeds obtained were taken out by decanting off the
calcium chloride solution, washed with sterilized distilled water for 3–4 times, and
surface dried with sterilized filter paper in Petri dishes for 5 min. Freshly
prepared beads were then transferred in sterile Petri dishes and sealed with
parafilm. Thirty synthetic seeds per Petri plate (three Petri plates for each
treatment) were maintained and kept in dark at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C). In all
the treatments, for storage studies, bursting of encapsulated beads was been
recorded at intervals of 15 days and considered not suitable for storage. Only those
unbursted beads were subjected to regeneration studies. Beads without containing any
osmotica were considered as control.

In all the cases of regeneration studies, each Petri plate was taken out at a
regular interval of 15 days and subcultured on regrowth medium [1/2 MS medium
containing 2.0 % sucrose (w/v), 0.6 % agar (w/v) along with 1 mg/l BAP and 0.1 mg/l
NAA, optimized media for PLB regeneration; Mohanty et al. 2012]. Survival percentage of stored synthetic
beads after transferring to regrowth medium was recorded after 8 weeks of culture.
The time taken by PLBs for emerging from beads, and for initiation of shoots and
roots were recorded.

Statistical analyses
The results were expressed as mean ± SE of three independent replicates of
independent experiments. Data were subjected to analysis of variance (one way
ANOVA) and Tukey’s multiple range tests using SPSS version 16.0.

Results and discussion
Incorporation of sucrose and mannitol in the encapsulated matrix does affect the
storage condition of the beads. Figures 1
and 2 show the effect of different
concentration of sucrose and mannitol in the encapsulating matrix on storage of
PLBs. In all these cases, more than half of PLBs burst out from the matrix in case
of 3 and 5 % of sucrose and mannitol along with control, thus making these
concentrations not suitable for storage studies. However, with increase in
concentration to 7.5 and 12.5 % in the encapsulating matrix, no outburst of
encapsulated PLBs was recorded (Fig 3a, e)
till 60 days, hence it can be concluded that these concentrations play an important
role in minimizing the growth of PLBs during storage condition. This may be due to
osmotic stress imposed on the PLBs by higher concentration of sucrose and mannitol.
Increased osmotic stress has been associated with cell plasmolysis resulting in
slower cell division (Loveys et al. 1975) and cell growth inhibition (Wong and Sussex 1980). PLBs encapsulated in the beads containing
15 % sucrose and mannitol in the encapsulating matrix died after 10 days which may
be due to increased rate of cell dehydration resulting in cell death. Therefore, the
regeneration studies of only these concentrations (7.5 and 12.5 %) of sucrose and
mannitol were further carried out.Fig. 1 Effect of different concentrations of sucrose incorporated in MS
medium in the encapsulating matrix on storage of D.
nobile PLBs. Mean values having the same letter in each column
are not significantly different at P < 0.05 (Tukey test) (n = 30)

On regeneration medium highest survival percentage (78.20 ± 0.41) of stored
encapsulated PLBs was obtained when 7.5 % mannitol was incorporated in the matrix
followed by 64.56 ± 0.38 % with 7.5 % sucrose (Table 1). But with increase in mannitol as well as sucrose concentration
to 12.5 % in the encapsulating matrix, a decrease in survival percentage
(60.00 ± 0.00 and 54.13 ± 0.12 %, respectively) of stored encapsulated PLBs was
recorded. Similarly, emergence of PLBs from the beads was much faster when 7.5 %
sucrose was incorporated (Fig. 3b) whereas
with increase in sucrose concentration to 12.5 % there was a delay in emergence of
PLBs when cultured on the regeneration medium. Normal shooting and rooting were
observed in encapsulated PLBs incorporated with 7.5 % sucrose (Fig. 3c, d) whereas shoot and root development were
completely inhibited when 12.5 % sucrose was incorporated in the encapsulating
matrix. A nearly similar result was obtained in case of mannitol. The time taken in
shoot and root development was much faster in PLBs encapsulated with 7.5 % mannitol
as compared to PLBs encapsulated with 12.5 % mannitol (Table 1; Fig. 3g, h).
It has been reported by many workers that relatively higher concentration of sucrose
in the alginate matrix significantly decreased plant development, especially root
formation. High levels of sucrose have been found to have adverse effects on shoot
and root morphogenesis (George 1993;
Panis 1995), which was also observed in
our result. The sugar alcohol mannitol is most widely employed as pregrowth media
additive for preservation studies (Withers and King 1980; Ng and Hahn 1985). However, variations exist between plants in their
physiological and structural responses to osmotically active compounds. Pritchard et
al. (1986) reported growth rate
reduction and cell wall thinning in Sycamore and Soybean cells following osmotic
stress due to higher concentration of mannitol but emphasized that cells display a
different capacity for osmotic adjustment and alteration in their cytoplasmic
component. Dehydration of PLBs at higher concentrations of mannitol results in the
suspension of cell division and growth. Espinoza et al. (1986) have also reported that mannitol in the
medium exerts an osmotic stress that leads to reduction in growth rate, hence acts
as an effective osmoticum for short-term storage.Table 1 Effect of different concentrations of sucrose and mannitol

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study developed highly effective techniques for synthetic
seed production, short-term storage and distribution of D.
nobile germplasm. The present work is first of its kind in case of
short-term storage of PLBs using sucrose and mannitol as osmotica. Hundred percent
of encapsulated PLBs of D. nobile could be stored
till 60 days using sucrose (7.5 and 12.5 %) and mannitol (7.5 and 12.5 %). But among
the all, 7.5 % mannitol was proved to be the best osmoticum for the storage.
Following the protocol or with a little modification, conservation and storage of
many rare, endangered and threatened orchid species will be possible.
