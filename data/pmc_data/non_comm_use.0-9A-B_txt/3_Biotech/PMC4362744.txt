Introduction
Amylases find potential application in number of industrial processes such as
bread making, brewing, starch processing, pharmacy, textile industries.
Alpha-amylase is an extracellular enzyme that randomly cleaves the 1,4 α-d-glucosidic linkages between adjacent glucose units
in the linear amylose chain. It is secreted as primary metabolite of microorganisms
and its production is a growth-related process (Kammoun et al. 2008). It possesses approximately 25–33 % share of
the world’s marketable enzymes. Microbial alpha-amylases are the most stable and
produced more economically compared to plant and animal alpha-amylases (Gupta et al.
2003).

To meet the growing demands of amylase for industrial application, it is
necessary to produce the highly efficient enzymes at large scale with reduced
production cost (Haq et al. 2003).
Submerged fermentation (SmF) has been traditionally used for the production of
industrially important enzymes because of the ease of handling and greater control
of environmental factors such as temperature and pH. Use of agro-industrial residues
as the substrate for the fermentation has growing interests as they are inexpensive
energy-rich resources and also eliminates large-scale accumulation of the biomass
(Pandey et al. 2000; Ramachandran et
al. 2007). Solid-state fermentation has
been generally referred useful for agro-residues utilization (Pandey et al.
2000; Babitha et al. 2007; Binod et al. 2007), although most of the commercial processes are based on
submerged fermentation. The growth and the enzyme production by the organisms are
strongly influenced by medium composition, and hence optimization of the medium
components may lead to improved enzyme productivity (Djekrif et al. 2006).

The main strategy used for optimizing the medium composition is by changing one
medium component as a parameter and keeping the others at a constant level
(Prajapati et al. 2013). Such
optimization studies do not consider the interaction effects among the variables
which influence the overall process for the production of a desired metabolite
(Silva et al. 2001). Single variable
optimization methods are not only tedious, but also can lead to misinterpretation of
results, especially because the interaction effects between different factors are
overlooked (Wenstet-Botz 2000).
Limitations of the single factor optimization can be eliminated by employing
response surface methodology (RSM) which is used to explain the combined effects of
all the factors in a fermentation process (Elibol 2004). Response surface methodology may be summarized as a
collection of experimental strategies, mathematical methods and statistical
inference for constructing and exploring an approximate functional relationship
between a response variable and a set of design variables.

In the present study, Plackett–Burman design is used for identifying various
nutrients as significant variables influencing alpha-amylase production by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KCP2. The levels of the
significant variables are further optimized using response surface
methodology.

Materials and methods
Strain isolation and identification
Bacterial strain isolated from municipal food waste samples collected from
Vallabh Vidyanagar, Gujarat, India, on Luria agar (LA) was screened for amylase
production on starch agar plate. Culture was maintained at 4 °C on Bushnell Hass
agar (BHA) slants containing 1 % starch. Bushnell Hass mineral salt solution has
the following composition (g/l): MgSO4 0.2,
CaCl2 0.02,
KH2PO4 1.00,
K2HPO4 1.00,
NH4NO3 1.00 and
FeCl3 0.05 (pH 7.0). Genomic DNA of the bacterial isolate
was extracted and the 16S rDNA gene was amplified using the universal primers (F,
5′ AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG 3′; R, 5′ GGTTACCTTGTTACAGCTT 3′). Amplification was
carried out in a thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) with reaction profile:
initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at
95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 45 s and
finally extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The purified PCR product was sequenced and
the phylogenic relationship of the isolate was determined by comparing the
sequence data with the existing sequences available through the gene bank database
of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

Preparation of inoculum
A volume of 50 ml of nutrient broth taken in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask was
inoculated with a loop full of cells from a 24-h-old culture and kept at 37 °C in
a rotary shaker. After 18 h of incubation, an appropriate aliquot of inoculum was
added to get one optical density unit in all the experimental flasks.

Enzyme production, extraction and assay procedure
The experiments were performed according to the design matrix
(Tables 2, 4) in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 5 g wheat bran as solid
substrate and 10 ml of the salt solution to provide the adequate moisture content.
After inoculation, all the experimental flasks were incubated under static
condition at 37 ± 2 °C and were harvested after 72 h interval followed by the
enzyme extraction with 40 ml of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) on a rotary
shaker at 150 rpm for 30 min at 25 °C. The content was filtered through muslin
cloth, centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 25 min and the clear supernatant was used for
determining alpha-amylase activity, which is expressed as U/gds (Units/gram dry
substrate). The reaction mixture consisted of 1.0 ml of 1 % starch, 0.9 ml 0.05 M
phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and 0.1 ml of enzyme extract. After 10 min of
incubation at 65 °C, the liberated reducing sugars were estimated by the
dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method of Miller (1959). The colour developed was read at 560 nm using a
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-160). TLC analysis of products of enzymatic
hydrolysis of starch indicated that it is alpha-amylase since the major end
product was found to be maltose.

Effect of the pH and temperature on the enzyme activity and
stability
Enzyme produced by the B. amyloliquefaciens
KCP2 was assayed at different temperatures and pH ranging 30–90 °C and 4–10,
respectively. Stability of enzyme was tested by incubating in buffers of different
pH (4–9) at 30 °C up to 180 min and residual activity was determined after each
10 min of incubation under standard assay condition. The thermal stability was
studied by incubating enzymes at various temperatures (30–90 °C) and residual
activity was measured after each 10 min of interval up to 180 min under standard
assay condition.

Screening of significant variables using Plackett–Burman design
Plackett–Burman design is a powerful technique for screening and evaluating
the important variables that influences the response (Plackett and Burman
1946). This technique significantly
decreases the number of experiments needed to decide the important variables. In
the present study, various medium components such as dextrose, starch, lactose,
soya bean meal, yeast extract, ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate and calcium
chloride were investigated as variables using PB design to identify the components
that significantly affected alpha-amylase production. In PB design each selected
variable was considered at two levels, high (+) and low (−) as shown in
Table 1. Using the selected levels for
each variable and three-dummy variable setup with 12 runs of experiment was
generated using the software as shown in Table 2. Each row represents a trial, and each column represents an
independent (assigned) or dummy (unassigned) variables. The effect of each
variable was determined by the following equation:Table 1 Variables representing medium components used in Plackett–Burman

 1 EXi=2ΣMi+-Mi-, where E (Xi) is the concentration
effect of the tested variable Mi+ and
Mi− representing the alpha-amylase production from
trials where the variable (Xi) measured was presented at high and low
concentrations, respectively. N is the total
number of trials, i.e. 12. Experimental error was estimated by calculating the
variance among the dummy variables as: 2 Veff=ΣEd2/n, where Veff is the variance of the effect of level, Ed is the effect of the level for the dummy variables and n is the number of dummy variables used in the
experiment. The standard error (SE, Es) of concentration effect was the square
root of variance of an effect, and the significance level (P value) of each concentration effect was determined using the
Student’s t test. 3 tXi=EXi/Es, where E (Xi) is the effect of
variable Xi.

Response surface methodology
The concentration of the medium components found as a significant variable and
the interaction effects between them which may influence the alpha-amylase
production significantly were analysed and optimized by response surface Central
Composite design (CCD). RSM is useful for small number of variables (up to five)
but is impractical for large number of variables, due to high number of
experimental runs required. In the present study, concentrations of the three
major medium components, starch, ammonium sulphate and calcium chloride
(identified by Plackett–Burman design) were optimized, keeping temperature, pH,
moisture and inoculum size constant.

According to the design, the total number of treatment combinations is 2k + 2k + no, where k is the number of independent variables and no is the
number of repetition of experiments at the central point. Each factor in the
design was studied at five different levels (−α, −1, 0, +1, +α) as shown in
Table 3. All variables were set at a
central coded value of zero. The minimum and maximum ranges of variables were
determined on the basis of our previous experiments. The full experimental plan
with respect to their values in actual and coded form is presented in
Table 4. The alpha-amylase activity was
measured in triplicate for all 20 different experimental runs. The enzyme
production was analysed by using a second-order polynomial equation, and the data
were fitted into the equation by multiple regression procedure. The model equation
for analysis is given as:Table 3 Experimental range and levels of the independent variables of

run using the optimum values for variables given by response optimization to
confirm the predicted value and experimental value of enzyme production.

Software and data analysis
The results of the experimental design were analysed and interpreted using
Design Expert Version 8.0 (Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA)
statistical software.

Results
Identification of the bacterial isolate
A 800-bp size 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate was obtained through PCR
amplification and sequencing. The sequence was subjected to a multiple sequence
alignment using the BLAST programme of NCBI. The sequence showed a homology of
99 % with B. amyloliquefaciens. The sequence
was deposited in the gene bank of the NCBI (Accession No: KF112071). The
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1) was drawn using
bioinformatics software MEGA 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007) after alignment of the sequences with the Clustal X
software.Fig. 1 Phylogenetic relationship on the basis of homology index for a

Activity and stability of alpha-amylase from B.
amyloliquefaciens KCP2
The alpha-amylase produced by B.
amyloliquefaciens KCP2 was assessed at different pH and temperature
ranges and it was observed that the activity was very low at acidic pH, but
increase in the pH led to gradual increase in enzyme activity. The maximum
activity of the enzyme was observed at pH 8.0 and was found to be highly stable in
alkaline pH (Fig. 2a, b). The optimum
temperature for alpha-amylase activity was found to be 65 °C and it showed good
stability in the temperature range of 30–90 °C. More than 85 % of residual
activity was observed in case of temperature ranging from 30 to 70 °C
(Fig. 3a, b).Fig. 2 Effect pH on enzyme activity (a) and stability (b)

Screening of significant parameter for alpha-amylase production using
Placket–Burman design
A statistical approach has been used to screen the most effective supplement
and select their concentration to achieve highest possible alpha-amylase
production by B. amyloliquefaciens KCP2 under
solid-state fermentation using wheat bran as solid substrate. Usually, initial
screening of the ingredients is done to understand the significance of their
effect on the product formation and then a few better ingredients are selected for
further optimization. Plackett–Burman design was used to screen eight different
medium components as carbon and nitrogen sources as a 12-run experiment with two
levels of concentration of each variable. Studies were carried out under
solid-state fermentation at 37 °C for 72 h. The medium components selected as
independent variables and their respective high and low concentrations used in
optimization study are presented in Table 1, whereas the Plackett–Burman experimental design followed for
the optimization of medium components for alpha-amylase production for 12 trials
with two levels of concentration of each variable is given in Table 2. The variable X1–X8 represented the medium
constituents and D1–D3 represented the dummy variable/unassigned variables. The
result of Plackett–Burman experiment with respect to amylase production, the
effect, standard error, t(xi), p and confidence level of each component are
represented in Tables 2 and 5. The components were screened at the confidence
level of 95 % on the basis of their effects. When components show significance at
or above 95 % confidence level and its effect is negative, it is considered
effective for production but the amount required may be lower than the indicated
low (−1) concentration in Plackett–Burman experiment. If the effect is found
positive, a higher concentration that the indicated high value (+) concentration
is required. In our experiment, starch, ammonium sulphate and calcium chloride
gave confidence level >95 % and could be considered significant and were
short-listed for further optimization of their required concentration and their
interaction effect leading to maximum enzyme production. Remaining components such
as lactose, yeast extract, soya bean meal, ammonium nitrate and dextrose showed
confidence level <95 % and were considered insignificant in the study. The
methodology of Plackett–Burman was thus found to be very useful for determination
of relevant variables for further optimization.Table 5 Statistical analysis of components for alpha-amylase production

Response surface methodology
The Central Composite design was employed to study the interaction among the
significant components and also determine their optimal levels. In the present
work, experiments were planned to obtain a quadratic model consisting of
23 trials. The plan includes 20 experiments and two
levels of concentration for each component. In order to study the combined effect
of these medium components, experiments were performed at different combinations.
Table 4 summarizes the Central Composite
experimental plan along with the predicted and observed response for each
individual experiment. It shows the production of alpha-amylase (U/gds)
corresponding to combined effect of all three components in the specified
ranges.

The optimum levels of the selected variables were obtained by solving the
regression equation and by analysing the response surface contour and surface
plots (Abdelhay et al. 2008). The
regression equation obtained after the analysis of variance (ANOVA) provides an
estimate of the level of alpha-amylase production as a function of starch,
ammonium sulphate, and calcium chloride concentration.

The production of alpha-amylase may be best predicted by the following
model: 5 Alpha-amylase productionY=47.94-3.08×A+1.11×B+3.51×C-1.00×A×B-0.61×A×C+2.22×B×C+0.09×A2+0.19×B2+1.68×C2, where Y is alpha-amylase production
(U/gds), A is starch concentration (w/w),
B is ammonium sulphate concentration (w/w),
and C is calcium chloride concentration
(mM).

The statistical significance of the second-order model equation was evaluated
by F test analysis of variance which revealed
that this regression is statistically highly significant for alpha-amylase
production. The model F value of 17.98 implies
that the model is significant. There is only a 0.01 % chance that a large “Model
F value” could occur due to noise. Values of
“Prob > F” <0.05 indicate that the model
terms are significant. In this case A,
B, C,
BC and C2 are significant model terms (Table 6). The “lack of fit F value” of 3.23 implies the lack of fit is not significant relative
to the pure error. Non-significant lack of fit is good for the model to fit. The
R2 value (multiple correlation coefficient) closer to 1
denotes better correlation between observed and predicted values. The coefficient
of variation (CV) indicates the degree of precision with which the experiments are
compared. The lower reliability of the experiment is usually indicated by high
value of CV. In the present case, a low CV (3.22 %) denotes that the experiments
performed are reliable. Adequate precision measures the signal-to-noise ratio. A
ratio >4 is desirable. In our case, the ratio is of 17.51, which indicates an
adequate signal. This model can be used to navigate the design space.Table 6 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for response surface quadratic

The effect of interaction of variables on enzyme (alpha-amylase production)
yield was studied against any two independent variables while keeping the other
independent variables at their constant level. These response surface plots or
contour plots can be used to predict the optimal values for different test
variables. Therefore, three response surfaces were obtained by considering all the
possible combinations. Three-dimensional response plot shown in Fig. 4a describes the behaviour of alpha-amylase
production, main effect, interaction effect and squared effect (nonlinear) of
starch and ammonium sulphate at different concentrations. Both the components at
their lower level did not show any significant effect on the alpha-amylase
production. The shape of the response surface curves showed a moderate interaction
between these tested variables. Increase in the starch concentration leads to
gradual decrease in the enzyme production, while increase in the ammonium sulphate
concentration results in the significant increase in the alpha-amylase production.
Figure 4b depicts three-dimensional
curve and contour plot of the calculated response surface from the interaction
between starch and calcium chloride while keeping fixed concentration of ammonium
sulphate. The level of the calcium chloride in the production medium showed
prominent effect on the alpha-amylase production. Increase in the calcium chloride
concentration leads to concomitant increment in the alpha-amylase yield, while
both components at their lower level did not result in the higher enzyme yield.
Figure 4c depicts the interaction of
ammonium sulphate and calcium chloride where the shape of the response surface
indicates positive interaction between these two factors. The enzyme yield was
found to increase with simultaneous increase in concentration of both the
components. Both the components at their lower level did not show any significant
effect on the enzyme yield.Fig. 4 Response surface graph showing interaction effects between
concentration of starch and ammonium sulphate (a), starch and calcium chloride (b), and ammonium sulphate and calcium chloride (c)



Validation of the quadratic model
Validation was carried out under conditions predicted by the response surface
model. The optimal concentrations estimated for each variable were 0.01 g starch,
0.2 g ammonium nitrate and 5 mM calcium chloride per 5 g of wheat bran. The
predicted alpha-amylase production obtained from the model using the above optimum
concentration of medium components was 61.48 U/gds. To validate the prediction of
the model, additional experiments in triplicate were performed with the optimized
medium. These experiments yielded the maximum amylase activity of 63.12 U/gds.
Good agreements between the predicted and experimental results verified the
validity of the model and the existence of the optimal points.

Discussion
Amylases have several interesting potential application in the food, detergent,
pharmaceutical, leather, textile, cosmetic, and paper industries. Still their
application in starch-based industries is the major market and thus demand of
amylases would always be very high in this sector. There is a constant search for
microorganisms producing enzyme with desired properties of pH and temperature
stability considering their industrial application. In this respect the isolate KCP2
was found to have production of enzyme with such properties and was characterized
further. As shown in the Fig. 1, the
evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor-joining method (Saitou and Nei
1987). The optimal tree with the sum
of branch length of 1.51712318 is shown and the percentage of replicate trees in
which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (500 replicates)
are shown next to the branches (Felsenstein 1985). The evolutionary distances were computed using the maximum
composite likelihood method (Tamura et al. 2004) and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per
site. Codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + non-coding and all positions
containing alignment gaps and missing data were eliminated only in pairwise sequence
comparisons (pairwise deletion option). There were a total of 1,579 positions in the
final dataset.

A marked enhancement in production of alpha-amylase by B. amyloliquefaciens in flask fermentation using statistical methods
was reported by Zhao et al. (2011). Use
of Plackett–Burman design to screen different nutrients affecting production of
thermostable β-amylase and pullulanase by Clostridium
thermosulfurogenes SV2 has been reported by Reddy et al. (1999). The substrate employed in the present
investigation, i.e. wheat bran, has been reported as a potent substrate for
production of alpha-amylase under SSF (Gangadharan et al. 2006; Ramachandran et al. 2004; Mulimani et al. 2000). It is well documented that wheat bran is
rich source of carbon and nitrogen, thus supplementation of other nitrogen sources
in the medium does not show any significant rise in the enzyme production but
sometimes presence of starch as an additional carbon source was found to have
inductive effect, and it also has remarkable efficiency in the production of enzyme,
being an inexhaustible source of carbon compared to other carbon sources (Prajapati
et al. 2013). In the present
investigation, apart from starch, lactose was also found to act as an inducer for
enzyme production as it gave 94.53 % confidence level during components screening
study. Added nitrogen sources also have been reported for an inducing effect for the
production of various enzymes including alpha-amylase in an SSF system (Pedersen and
Nielsen 2000; Akher et al. 1973). Earlier reports show that among various
inorganic nitrogen sources tested, ammonium sulphate, ammonium chloride and ammonium
hydrogen phosphate favour growth and enzyme secretion (Narang and Satyanarayana
2001).

Alpha-amylase is an inducible enzyme, which is generally induced in the presence
of starch or its hydrolytic product maltose (Rama and Srivastav 1995). Bacillus
thermooleovorans preferred starch, glucose, lactose, maltose and
maltodextrin as favourable carbon sources for amylase secretion (Narang and
Satyanarayana 2001). In some cases,
hydrolyzed starch and glucose were found to repress the enzyme yield, which may be
due to feedback inhibition caused by the presence of reducing sugars. Easily
metabolizable carbohydrates may result in the better growth of the organism along
with reduction in the enzyme formation (Rama and Srivastav 1995). The supplementation of metal ions has been
reported to provide good growth and also influence higher enzyme yield
(Sivaramakrishnan 2006). Most of the
alpha-amylase is metalloenzymes and in most of the cases,
Ca+2 ions are required for maintaining the spatial
conformation of the enzyme, thus play an important role in the enzyme stability and
its activity. Amylase from the halophilic Bacillus sp. Strain TSCVKK showed
stability at a wide pH range of 6.5–10.5 with maximum activity with pH 8.0
suggesting the alkalitolerant nature (Kondepudi and Chandra 2008). Majority of the literature showed that
50 °C is the optimum temperature for alpha-amylase activity, but in our case we
found that 65 °C is the optimum temperature for the activity of enzyme produced by
B. amyloliquefaciens KCP2. Temperature and pH
stability of this enzyme justify its alklophilic and thermophilic nature.
Statistical approach has also been applied for the production of various enzymes,
such as cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) (Gawande and Patkar 1999; Mahat et al. 2004), chitinase (Gohel et al. 2005), pectinase (Nair and Panda 1997), vitamin riboflavin (Punjari and Chandra 2000) and glucoamylase (Prajapati et al.
2013).

Present investigation has allowed rapid screening and level optimization of a
large number of nutrient parameters influencing thermophilic and alklophilic
alpha-amylase production from B.
amyloliquefaciens KCP2 using statistical methodology. The results also
showed the use of cheap agro-residue as substrate for fermentation, thus
contributing to the reduction in cost of production medium. The enzyme yield and the
production were found to be significantly influenced by starch, ammonium sulphate
and calcium chloride concentration. The data obtained after optimization has
resulted in 63.12 U/gds enzyme production. Even though SSF is widely applied for
enzyme production using filamentous fungi, the results of the present study proved
that a bacterial isolate such as B.
amyloliquefaciens KCP2 can be successfully used for the production of
alpha-amylase employing wheat bran within a relatively shorter time interval of
3 days.
