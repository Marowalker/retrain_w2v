Introduction
Fermentation is one of the oldest methods of food preservation and is widely
practiced at household level by rural folk to produce variety of traditional
fermented foods and beverages (Cooke et al. 1987; Sasson 1988).
Fermented foods generally preserve pleasant flavor, aroma, texture, enhanced
nutritive values and good keeping quality under ambient conditions (Law et al.
2011). Several indigenous fermented
foods and beverages produced at the household level in Swaziland were reviewed by
Masarirambi et al. (2009). India being
a large country displays climatic, ethnic and religious diversities vis-à-vis
variation in food production and consumption. A lot of diversity prevails in the
food habits of the people living in different parts of the country especially in the
hilly regions where people have evolved indigenous method of preparing fermented
foods and beverages based on easily available local raw materials. The skills of
food preservation existed in the native people and the know-how of these
fermentation was propagated orally (Prajapati 2003). Diversity of fermented foods in Asia is directly related to
food culture of each and every community, and also the availability of raw materials
(Tamang 2011).

In Himachal Pradesh, people have developed traditional food processing
technologies for preparing fermented foods from locally available substrates largely
governed by the ethnic preference, agroclimatic conditions, socio-cultural ethos and
religion. A number of traditional fermented products are prepared and consumed in
Himachal and the types of traditional fermented products of Himachal are unique and
different from other areas (Thakur et al. 2003). Bhatooru, chilra, seera, siddu,
gulgule, marchu, sepubari and pickles made from various locally
available fruits and vegetables and different beverages like kinnauri, chhang, sura, behmi, etc. are some indigenous fermented
products of Himachal Pradesh (Savitri 2007). Fermented foods have been a part of the staple diet in the
rural areas of Himachal (specially the districts of Lahaul and Spiti, Kinnaur,
Chamba and Kullu).

Bhatooru is indigenous leavened bread that
contributes the staple diet of rural population of Himachal. Bhatooru is served with vegetables, dal or curry for routine meals and deep-fried on festive occasions.
Malera is a traditional inoculum used for
preparation of bhatooru.

Materials and methods
The samples of the inoculum (malera) used for
bhatooru fermentation were collected
aseptically from different areas of the state, stored in refrigerator and used for
further studies. Wheat flour for preparation of bhatooru was purchased from the local market of Shimla, Himachal
Pradesh (‘Shakti Bhog brand’).

Preparation of bhatooru
Bhatooru was prepared by mixing 450 g of
wheat flour with 300 ml of water. 50 g of malera (traditional inoculum) was added to the mixture and knead to
form consistent dough. The dough was kept at 25 °C in incubator for 10 h for
fermentation. After every 2 h, samples were taken and stored at 4 °C for further
analysis. For microbiological analysis, the samples were processed immediately. A
part of the dough was baked to prepare bhatooru.

Microbial profile during the fermentation
One gram of malera and one gram of dough
sample withdrawn at an interval of 2 h were plated on nutrient agar, Czapek Malt
agar and Lactobacillus selection agar plates
for isolation of bacteria, yeasts and lactic acid bacteria by incubating at 30 °C
for bacteria and 25 °C for yeasts. The number of colonies of bacteria and yeasts
that appeared on plates after 24–48 h of incubation were counted and expressed as
cfu g−1 of the sample. The microorganisms isolated
were identified at and submitted to Microbial Type Culture Collection and Gene
Bank (MTCC), Chandigarh.

Biochemical analysis
Samples during bhatooru dough fermentation
were analyzed for various biochemical parameters viz., moisture by Winton and
Winton (2001), total acidity by
Amerine et al. (1980) and pH. Total
proteins were estimated by using the methods of Lowry et al. (1951) and total carbohydrates were estimated by
phenol sulphuric acid method (Dubois et al. 1956). Reducing sugars were estimated by DNSA method given by
Miller (1959). Starch was estimated
according to Hedge and Hofreiter (1962). The activity of protease and amylase was assayed by the
method given by Manachini et al. (1988) and Bernfield (1955), respectively. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of
the proteins of fermented dough has also been performed to analyze the protein
profile (gliadin and glutenin) during bhatooru
fermentation.

Vitamin and amino acid analysis
Analysis of vitamins in fermented dough, malera and flour has been done according to Šnajdrová et al.
(2004). For assay of water soluble
B vitamins, the samples of fermented food were filtered through 0.45 μm pore size
filters. The mobile phase composed of acetonitrile:HPLC water (75:25) and 0.1 %
orthophosphoric acid. Samples (5 μl) of the solution of water-soluble vitamins
were injected into the HPLC column. Identification of compounds was made by
comparing their retention times and UV spectra with those of standards. The
vitamin concentrations in the samples were calculated from the integrated areas of
the samples and their corresponding standards.

For amino acid analysis, sample was first hydrolysed (Schilling et al.
1996) and then derivatization
(Hûsek 1991) was done. Prior to
analysis, the samples were dried at room temperature for 40 h. One gram sample was
taken and transferred to glass sample tubes. These samples were placed inside a
glass hydrolysis chamber. To each tube, 2 μl of norleucine was added as internal
standard solution (1,500 ppm in 0.1 M HCl). A 200 μl of 6 M HCl was introduced to
the bottom of the chamber and kept at 105 °C in an oven for 24 h to fully
hydrolyze the samples. After complete hydrolysis, the remaining traces of acid
were removed by washing with 15 μl of water and then dried at 50 °C. The
hydrolysate was dissolved in 120 μl of 25 mM HCl.

An aliquot of the hydrolysate was taken in a vial which usually contained less
than 100 μg of amino acids. To this 100 μl of water:ethanol:pyridine (60:32:8) was
added and mixed properly. Then 5 μl of ECF was added to this mixture and the tube
was shaken gently for about 5 s till foaming due to gas evolution occurred. 100 μl
of chloroform (containing 1 % ECF) was added and the vials were gently tapped to
facilitate separation of the two layers. 2 μl of chloroform layer (lower layer)
was injected in GC. Gas chromatographic analysis was carried out on a Netel
Chromatograph GC (MICHRO-9100) equipped with Chromosorb WHP 15 % SE-30 column
coupled with flow Ionization Detector. The GC was operated at the oven temperature
170–295 °C, injector temperature 170–280 °C, ramp rate 5 °C and carrier flow
(nitrogen) 5 ml/min.

Results and discussion
Microbiological analysis of malera
(traditional inoculum) and dough in bhatooru fermentation
The microbiological analysis of malera
revealed that it was a consortium of microorganisms which mainly consisted of
lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Lactobacillus
plantarum (MTCC 8296), Leuconostoc
sp. and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MTCC 7840)
were isolated from different samples of malera.
The microflora of malera depends on flour,
water used for dough preparation, utensils used, prevailing hygienic conditions as
well as various parameters of the fermentation. The most relevant bacteria
isolated from sourdough belonged to the genus Lactobacillus (Stolz 2003). Various yeast strains have also been isolated from
spontaneous sourdough fermentations such as Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Pichia satoi (Beech
and Davenport 1971). There have been
several reports (Okada et al. 1992;
Oura et al. 1982; Spicher
1984; Spicher and Schroder
1978, 1980) of lactobacilli occurring among the
dominant microbial population in sourdough where they contribute to dough
fermentation. Lactobacillus species are widely
distributed in various fermented foods, dairy products and plant and animal
materials (Cai et al. 1999).

A large number of bacteria and yeast were isolated from fermented dough
samples of bhatooru fermentation at different
intervals of time (Table 1). The
microflora of the fermented dough was mainly dominated by yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisisae), lactic acid bacteria
(Lactobacillus plantarum) and Bacillus sp. The gas producing Leuconostoc sp. also appeared at 4 h of fermentation causing
leavening of dough. The source of these organisms might be the ingredients,
vessels, and the surroundings followed by rapid multiplication during
fermentation. With the progress in fermentation, total microbial count increased
from 6 × 104 to
1 × 108 cfu/g decreasing the pH from 5.94 to 4.18. The
decrease in the pH prevents the growth of undesirable microorganisms but the
desirable microorganisms like yeast, Leuconostoc and Lactobacilli can
very well propagate at this pH. Saccharomyces
cerevisisae has been reported from various fermented foods and
beverages such as bhalle, beer, burukutu, bourbon whiskey, coffee beans, cider,
merissa, fufu, tape, ogi, puto, dosa, idli, papdam,
kecap, lao chao, warri, scotch
whiskey, etc. (Padmaja and George 1999; Batra and Millner 1974, 1976; Soni and
Sandhu 1990). Some species of
Bacillus and other bacteria such as Kocuria rhizophila, Pseudomonas synxantha and Microbacteriun saperdae were also found during the
initial stages of bhatooru fermentation and
these organisms gradually disappeared with the progress of fermentation. This may
be due to the production of acids and gas from various carbohydrates by lactic
acid bacteria thus making the environment unfit for many of the bacterial
population initially present.Table 1 Changes in microflora, pH and volume in dough during bhatooru fermentation

Dough used for bhatooru preparation has
also been prepared without the addition of malera (control) to compare the fermentation process with malera added preparation. These studies showed the
involvement of only bacteria like Bacillus sp.,
Kocuria rhizophila and Enterobacter sp. in control and the total count of
bacterial population increases from 4 × 102 cfu/g at
0 h to 5 × 106 cfu/g of dry matter at 10th h.
Microorganisms (Leuconostoc sp., Lactobacillus sp. and S.
cerevisiae) which actively produce gases and acids were absent in the
control dough (Table 1). Moreover, such
preparation lacked the typical aroma otherwise contributed by the yeast and lactic
acid bacteria in the fermented product.

Chemical and biochemical analysis of fermented dough
The traditional inoculum-malera used for
bhatooru fermentation was collected from
Kullu and analyzed for various biochemical parameters. The biochemical analysis of
malera revealed that it is an acidic dough
having a pH of 3.7, titratable acidity of 0.62 and 46 % moisture. It has 20 %
(w/w) protein, 571.0 mg/g of dry matter carbohydrate, 496.0 mg/g dry matter starch
and 23.2 mg/g dry matter reducing sugars. The activities of amylase and protease
were 25.7 and 1.67 U/g respectively.

With the decrease in pH from 5.94 to 4.18, total acidity in fermented sample
increased from 0.028 to 0.14 %. This may be due to the production of acetic acid
and lactic acid during fermentation by lactic acid bacteria and yeast. The
increase in acid content is in proportion with the increase in lactic acid
bacteria count. The increase in the total acidity in fermented sample helps in
enhancing the shelf life of fermented foods as well as it imparts typical aroma
and taste to the product (Hammes and Gänzle 1998). However, the change in both pH (from 6.7 to 6.48) and
acidity (from 0.018 to 0.045 %) is very less in the case of control. The fall in
pH and increase in titratable acidity in dough during fermentation are considered
important for prevention of malfermentation and spoilage of bread. At low pH of
sourdough, the growth and activity of spoilage organisms such as Bacillus subtilis or Clostridia which cause ropiness, are suppressed (Hammes and Gänzle
1998).

The change in total protein content during bhatooru fermentation has been studied and it was found that there
was an increase in total proteins from 13.6 to 18.4 % (w/w) on dry weight basis
from 0 to 10th h of fermentation. However, there was no significant change in
total protein content in case of control. Increase in protein content in fermented
food on dry weight basis might be due to utilization of carbohydrates. The amount
of total sugars during fermentation decreased from 74.1–50.1 % (w/w) on dry weight
basis in fermented dough and 73.9–66.1 % (w/w) on dry weight basis in control
dough (Table 2). The decrease in total
sugars might be due to the metabolism of sugars by bacteria and yeast. The sugars
are rapidly metabolized to acids, ethanol, biomass, carbon dioxide and other
metabolites required for the growth of microorganisms with concomitant decrease in
total sugars during fermentation (Mensah 1997).Table 2 Biochemical parameters in fermented dough during bhatooru fermentation and control

F Fermented dough, C Control



As given in Table 2 the level of
reducing sugar in dough increased significantly in the first 4 h of fermentation
and thereafter it gradually decreased to 10.0 mg/g dry matter by 10 h. In control,
the level of reducing sugars increased gradually from 4.0 to 21.1 mg/g dry matter
up to 8 h and thereafter it declined to 15.7 mg/g dry matter at 10th h. Initial
increase in reducing sugar can be implicated with the activity of inherent
amylases in the flour which might have got activated with the addition of water
during the preparation of dough. The rate of conversion of starch to reducing
sugars mediated by amylases was initially higher than the rate of consumption of
reducing sugars by the fermentative organisms and later the rate of sugar
consumption got enhanced due to augmentation in the number of fermentative
organisms. It has been reported that as the pH of the ferment decreases, the
saccharification of starch by amylases and amyloglucosidases is also reduced and
this results in gradual decrease of reducing sugars concentration towards the
later stages of fermentation (Syu and Chen 1997; Narendranathan et al. 1997).

The change in starch content in dough during 10 h of bhatooru fermentation is given in Table 2. The starch content in dough was 70.2 % (w/w) on dry weight
basis at 0 h. After 2 h of fermentation it started decreasing and finally (at 10 h
fermentation) its level went down to 48.3 % (w/w) on dry weight basis. The starch
content in control almost remained constant. Starch is saccharified to
monosaccharides and disaccharides by inherent amylases of flour, which are
utilized by lactic acid bacteria and yeast present in the sourdough for their
growth and production of acids (Röcken et al. 1992).

Protease and amylase activity
The protease activity was more in fermented dough sample as compared to that
of control. In control, the activity of enzyme ranged from 0.32 to 0.50 U/g dry
weight of sample while in fermented dough samples, the protease activity increased
from 0.48 U/g dry matter to 11.5 U/g in 6 h and then decreased to 3.21 U/g on dry
weight basis in 10 h of fermentation (Table 2). The proteolytic activity during the fermentation of sourdough
leads to the enhancement of free amino acid content that are well known precursors
of flavour formation in bread (Thiele et al. 2002). The proteolysis is caused by flour enzymes, microbial
enzymes of flour and by sourdough bacteria. The proteolytic activity has been
mainly attributed to the endogenous enzymes of the flour (Kratochvil and Holas
1988; Spicher and Nierle
1988). The lactic acid bacteria of
sourdough have also been reported to produce protease during the fermentation of
sourdough (Spicher and Nierle 1988).

It has also been observed that the electrophoretic profiles of the fermented
dough are different from that of unfermented or flour samples. During bhatooru fermentation, wheat proteins (gliadins and
glutenins) had got hydrolysed due to proteolytic activity of flour and
microorganisms (Fig. 1, 2). The disappearance of protein (especially
glutenins subunits) bands in the fermented dough were observed, which may be due
to the hydrolysis of both HMW (high molecular weight) and LMW (low molecular
weight) gluten subunits and α, β, γ and ω subunits of gliadins during fermentation
by the activity of proteolytic enzymes. The hydrolysis of wheat proteins with the
progress of fermentation can be correlated to the increase in amino acid level in
the fermented dough. The substantial hydrolysis of gliadin and glutenin proteins
occur during sourdough fermentation due to pH-mediated activation of cereal
enzymes, especially aspartic proteinase that appears to be active in the
conditions of wheat sourdough (Thiele et al. 2003; Loponen et al. 2004). Furthermore, sourdough fermentation results in
solubilisation and depolymerization of the gluten macropolymer (Thiele et al.
2004).Fig. 1 SDS–PAGE of wheat proteins (gliadins) of dough. Lane 1: Molecular weight markers (phosphorylase

The amylolytic activity was measured up to 10 h of fermentation in dough and
control samples and the results are given in Table 2. It first increased from 65.0 to 79.4 U/g of dry matter in 6 h
and then decreased to 69.9 U/g of dry matter by 10 h of fermentation. Amylase
activity was lower i.e. 33.1 units/g in case of control. Increase in amylolytic
enzymes during the course of fermentation has been reported in several Indian
fermented foods such as Punjabi warri, idli, dosa, jalebi,
khaman (Soni and Arora 2000, 1990; Sankaran
1998).

Vitamin and amino acid analysis
The fermentation of dough significantly enhanced the B vitamin levels
especially thiamine, riboflavin and nicotinic acid (Table 3). The rise in the level of various vitamins
especially thiamine and riboflavin appears to be due to the increase the
microflora and yeasts, most of which have the ability to produce vitamins from
simple precursors (Steinkraus 1998).
Soni and Arora (2000) also reported
significant increase in the water-soluble B vitamins including thiamine,
riboflavin and cyanocobalamin in bhalle
fermentation and dosa batter fermentation.
Warri fermentation also brings about an
appreciable rise in water-soluble B vitamins including thiamine, riboflavin and
cyanocobalamin (Soni and Arora 2000).Table 3 Vitamin and amino acid content in wheat flour, malera and fermented dough

It was observed that fermentation significantly modified the relative amount
of amino acids in dough. The various essential amino acids such as methionine,
phenylalanine, threonine, leucine and lysine exhibited remarkable increase
(Table 3). However, control did not show
an appreciable increase in amino acid content with respect to the wheat flour. The
increase in these amino acids in bhatooru
fermentation is an indication of hydrolysis of proteins by the activities of
proteolytic enzymes as well as the addition of such amino acids by the
fermentative microbes, due to their metabolic activities in the product. Similar
findings were reported by Soni and Arora (2000) during the warri,
idli and dosa fermentation where they observed a significant increase in free
amino acids from 9.79–45.15 mg, 8.3–12.9 mg and 10.2–17.8 mg respectively on dry
weight basis. The increase in free d- and
l-amino acids in sourdoughs by various
lactic acid bacteria and yeasts has been reported by Gobbetti et al. (1994).

The final products bhatooru and chapati/roti
prepared from fermented and unfermented dough were analyzed for various
biochemical parameters and results are summarized in Table 4. From these studies it can be concluded that
nutritive value (especially vitamins and amino acids) in bhatooru which was prepared by fermentation with the addition of
traditional inoculum (malera), is greatly
enhanced as compared to chapati/roti.Table 4 Comparative analysis of bhatooru and roti

Conclusions
From these studies it is evident that traditional fermentation adds quality to
staple food bhatooru by way of enhancing their
protein content, vitamin and essential amino acids. This is the first ever study on
bhatooru, a traditional fermented food of rural
hilly people of Himachal which shows that it has better nutritional value as
compared to chapatti/roti prepared from
unfermented dough. So the use of this fermented food as a source of protein,
vitamins and amino acids can be popularized to improve the nutrition and social
well-being of rural and urban people of Himachal Pradesh. In addition to this, these
studies will provide base for scale up of processes practiced at household level to
small-scale industrial units by the entrepreneurs.
