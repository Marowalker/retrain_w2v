extracted with the help of microwave assisted extraction (MAE). The extraction
solvent used was ethanol, which is eco-friendly and reduced the risk of
environmental hazard. The mangiferin content was found to increase until 500 W, but
decreased as the microwave power was increased further. A similar threshold was also
obtained for microwave irradiation time. Following a mathematical analysis, an
optimal mangiferin yield of 41 μg/mL was obtained from an extraction time of 15.32 s
for a microwave power of 500 W.

Introduction
Due to the presence of health promoting components such as vitamins, minerals,
antioxidants and prebiotics, there is a growing interest in the extraction of the
bioactive compounds from fruits, vegetables and spices. Several techniques are
available for the extraction of bioactive compounds from plant sources including
Soxhlet, microwave assisted extraction (MAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE),
and heat reflux extraction (HRE). The main advantages of MAE are the considerable
reduction in time and solvent as compared to the conventional techniques (Xiao et
al. 2008). Curcuma amada, an understudied spice, belongs to the family
Zingiberaceae, and has medicinal properties. It looks like ginger, but has mango
flavour and is usually used for culinary purposes in the Indian sub-continent.
Mangiferin is a phytochemical and is said to be present in mango ginger. It has a
wide range of pharmacological activities including anti-diabetic, anti-HIV,
anti-cancer, immune modulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties
(Wauthoz et al. 2007). However, no
reports on MAE of mangiferin from C. amada have
yet been published. In this study, we report on the feasibility of MAE for the
extraction of mangiferin from C. amada. Our work
aims to determine the effect of different microwave power and irradiation time on
the mangiferin extraction from C. amada along
with the kinetic parameters for efficient extraction through simple mathematical
approach.

Materials and methods
Mango ginger (C. amada) was purchased from a
local supplier in Durgapur, India. The rhizomes were washed, sliced and dried in a
hot air oven (OVFU, India) at 60 °C for 72 h and powdered in a grinder. Mangiferin
standard was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, USA. The extraction of mangiferin was
carried out with the method of Krivut et al. (1985) with slight modifications. The C.
amada extract obtained after microwave irradiation was evaporated in a
Rotary Vacuum Evaporator (Yamato, Japan), filtered and separated to remove other
inactive molecules using chloroform and butanol. The final purified extract was
evaporated and dissolved in DMSO and analysed with a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(UV-2310, Techcomp), at 410 nm. The estimation of mangiferin was followed using the
method described by Joubert et al. 2008.

Statistical analysis
The statistical software SPSS 11 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for the data
analysis. The two factors, microwave power (MP, main factor) and microwave
irradiation time (MIT, random factor), were treated on a randomised complete block
design. Means and coefficients of variance were computed for all qualitative
analysis and treatments with homogeneous means ranked using the Newman–Keuls post
hoc test. The effect of these two factors with mangiferin content was compared using
the bi-variant correlation analysis. A paired sample T test was used to compare the differences between two groups. The
significance of the results was established at values greater than 0.05 in all the
experiments performed.

Result and discussion
Effect of microwave power and irradiation time on the mangiferin
yield
2.5 gm of dried powder of C. amada was
extracted with 50 mL of 50% aqueous ethanol under different microwave power (350,
450, 500 and 600 W) for different MIT (5–80 s), as shown in Fig. 1. The solvent used was 50% ethanol, as the solvent
of medium polarity was found to improve mangiferin extraction (unpublished
results). The concentration of mangiferin and the extraction efficiency were found
to improve when the microwave power was raised from 350 to 500 W. When the
microwave power was raised from 350 to 500 W, electromagnetic energy was
transferred to the extraction system quickly and this improved the extraction
efficiency. However, the concentration of mangiferin decreased at 600 W microwave
power. Similar results were observed by Xiao et al. (2008) in the extraction of flavonoid from Radix astragali at high power due to non-orderly molecular
interactions. During shorter irradiation time (till 20 s), the mangiferin content
increased with microwave power. However, when the extraction solution was heated
beyond 20 s the mangiferin content reduced, and this reduction was observed in all
microwave powers. This might be due to the high temperature involved in the
extraction process which might have caused degradation of mangiferin (Kim et al.
2010). The mangiferin content was
24 μg/mL, 35.26 μg/mL and 41.10 μg/mL at 350 W, 450 W and 500 W, respectively,
with an exposure of 20-s irradiation time which decreased to 3.083 μg/mL,
4.35 μg/mL and 5.87 μg/mL after 80 s of MIT. This result indicates that very high
irradiation time is not suitable for mangiferin extraction.Fig. 1 Effect of microwave power (350–600 W) and microwave irradiation
time (5–80 s) on the mangiferin concentration



Statistical results indicate that the mangiferin concentration is negatively
correlated with both microwave power (insignificant, p = 0.721) and MIT (significant, p = 0.000). The paired sample T
test is significant between the two groups, i.e. mangiferin concentration with MIT
and microwave power (MP). The results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) are given in
Table 1. Both microwave power and MIT
along with their interaction is significantly different. Newman-Keuls test shows
that the mangiferin content is significantly different at all microwave power,
with microwave power of 500 W yielding the highest mean mangiferin content. In
case of MIT, there is no significant difference in mangiferin content at 50 and
60 s. However, the mangiferin content differ significantly with remaining MIT.
Statistical results indicate that the optimal mangiferin yield was obtained at
500 W microwave power and irradiation time of around 20 s.Table 1 Results of a one-way ANOVA showing the significance of the two

Mathematical model formulation
Considering the two process parameters namely, the MIT and microwave power, an
extraction model describing the relationship between these parameters and the
extraction efficiency was constructed. The parameters of the model were fitted
with a non-linear least-squares (NLLS) Marquardt–Levenberg algorithm, using the
device-independent plotting program Gnuplot. It must be noted that the
mean-averaged data used in the mathematical modelling is obtained by repeating the
extraction process using different samples of C.
amada. The response for 600 W was found to be different from the
other three responses (i.e. from 350, 450 and 500 W) for all the samples studied,
and did not follow a clear sequence. The same had been observed for the response
at 600 W microwave power using statistical analysis. The dataset of 600 W was,
therefore, neglected while validating the model. This assumption is further
strengthened by the statistical analysis, mentioned in the previous section, that
a probable optimum can be found at 500 W and somewhere around 20 s of irradiation
time. Based on the experimental data (see Fig. 1), the following expression was formulated: 1  where x and y denotes irradiation time (in s) and microwave power (in W),
respectively. Equation (1) was obtained by
presuming one term constant in time (evolving a little with power since the time
evolutions do not reach zero but to some positive limit), and the other term
(which is the product of exponential decay in time with a certain power in time)
modulated linearly by power. The optimal fit (in green) of the experimental data
(in red) using the mathematical model is shown in Fig. 2. The optimal values of the parameters obtained due to
regression are given in Table 2.Fig. 2 Proposed mathematical model (in green) for the microwave extraction procedure using the

Using the mathematical model, an optimal yield of 40.65 μg/mL was obtained
from an irradiation time of 15.32 s for a microwave power of 500 W. The
root-mean-square (RMS) value of residuals and the variance of residuals (reduced
Chi-square) was calculated to be 5.38 and 28.98 based on 21 degrees of freedom,
respectively. Note that the tolerance value set for the parameter estimation is
1 × 10−5. The predicted model fitted well with the
experimental data. It can be concluded that the proposed model correctly describes
the MAE of mangiferin from C. amada. However,
to obtain a more accurate fit, it is necessary to use additional process
parameters for the mathematical model such as solvent mass ratio, solvent
concentration, extraction cycle and extraction (leaching) time. These factors have
been found to influence mangiferin yield while using traditional extraction
techniques.

Conclusion
This study demonstrates the feasibility of microwave assisted extraction of
mangiferin from C. amada. Experimental results
showed that the mangiferin content initially increased up to 20 s of irradiation
time for all microwave power studied. A statistical analysis was performed which
indicated an optimum mangiferin concentration at 500 W for an irradiation time of
around 20 s. Optimal values of irradiation time and microwave power was obtained
using a mathematical model based on nonlinear least-squares technique. Moreover,
usage of ethanol as an eco-friendly alternative overcomes the serious hazards posed
by various techniques adapted by humans. Thus, the extraction of mangiferin from
C. amada using microwaves and ethanol is
efficient not only from the industrial point of view by preventing environmental
hazards, but also can be controlled using simple mathematical model. However, a
rigorous experimental analysis using several influencing factors needs to be
performed which can help posit the mathematical relationship justified by the
mechanisms involved.
