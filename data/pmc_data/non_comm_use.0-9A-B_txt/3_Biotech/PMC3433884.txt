Introduction
In recent years, much attention has been focused on polysaccharides isolated
from natural sources. During the last decade, numerous bioactive polysaccharides
with interesting functional properties have been discovered from seaweeds
(Fig. 1). Several algal species belonging
to phaeophyta, rhodophyta and chlorophyta divisions have been recognized as crucial
sources of sulfated polysaccharides (SP). These SP constitute an important
ingredient of cell walls and get harvested by suitable extraction or precipitation
method, followed by purification, characterization and biological studies
(Fig. 2). The biological features of the
SP reported till now are antioxidant, antitumor, immunomodulatory, inflammation,
anticoagulant, antiviral, antiprotozoan, antibacterial, antilipemic. Currently, the
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering application of the SP has become a hot
research area. Jiménez-Escrig et al. (2011) have reviewed the vital role of SP from seaweeds in human
health.Fig. 1 Seaweeds growing on the California Coast of the Pacific
Ocean

polysaccharide preparation and biological activity evaluation



Bioactive SP extracted from seaweeds can be classified into three types. The
major fucan yielding brown seaweeds genera are Fucus, Sargassum, Laminaria, Undaria,
Lessonia, Dictyota,
Dictyopteris,Ascophyllum, Eclonia,
Canistrocarpus, Lobophota, Turbinaria, Padina, Adenocystis, Sphacelaria, Cystoseira, etc. Fucan represents a
family of water soluble, SP rich in sulfated l-fucose, extracted from extracellular matrix of these weeds (Li et al.
2008; Costa et al. 2011a). Fucoidan, the sulfated alpha-l-fucan (term often interchangeably used with fucans)
has demonstrated a wide range of pharmacological activities. Carrageenans are a
family of linear SP, extracted from red seaweeds, viz. Gracialaria, Gigartina, Gelidium, Lomentaria, Corallina, Champia, Solieria,
Gyrodinium, Nemalion,Sphaerococcus,
Boergeseniella, Sebdenia, Scinaia, etc. This group of polysaccharides has a backbone of alternating 3-linked
β-d-galactose and 4-linked α-d-galactose residues (Tuvikene et al. 2006). Three categories of carrageenans, kappa
(κ), iota (ι), and lambda (λ) have been identified till now based on their sulfation
degree, solubility and gelling properties (Leibbrandt et al. 2010). Ulvan is the major water soluble, sulfated
polysaccharide, extracted from the cell wall of green algae, viz.Ulva, Enteromorpha, Monostroma, Caulerpa, Codium, Gayralia.
Ulvans are composed of disaccharide repetition moieties made up of sulfated rhamnose
linked to either glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, or xylose and represent about
8–29 % of the algal dry weight (Lahaye and Robic 2007). The above-described SP have been illustrated in
Fig. 3.Fig. 3 Classification of the bioactive sulfated
polysaccharides



The therapeutic mechanisms of these SP vary, hence it is yet to be studied
precisely. For anticoagulation potency, the formation of the SP/protease protein
complex and the associated non-specific polar interaction between the negatively and
positively charged groups in the polysaccharide and protein is responsible for
anticoagulant activity. The anticoagulant activity is mainly attributed to thrombin
inhibition mediated by heparin cofactor II, with different effectiveness depending
on the compound. Similarly, selectin blockade, inhibition of enzyme and complement
cascade seem to be the triggers leading to anti-inflammation. Combating viral
infection has been shown by adsorption and internalization steps (Kim et al.
2011, 2012).

Ion exchange, gel filtration, FTIR, NMR analyses are employed to elucidate the
composition and structure of SP. Cutting edge technologies, viz. MTT assay, flow cytometry, western blot analysis, BCA
protein assay, SDS-PAGE and gelatin zymography has been employed for analysis of
their functional properties (Jiang and Guan 2009). Although the use of the seaweed-derived polysaccharides in
food industry as thickening, gelling agents, and stable excipients for control
release tablets are well established, the clinical use is still to gain ground.
Manifold increase in the published findings on this aspect in recent time is
evidence enough for the craze over this highly promising domain. Recently, Senni et
al. (2011) have reviewed the
advancement in therapeutic potential of marine polysaccharides. However, this report
was not confined to seaweeds and dealt only with the tissue engineering
applications. Also, Wijesekara et al. (2011) have published an overview of clinically crucial SP extracted
from marine algae. Keeping with the hot trend and in an attempt to present a new
perspective, the present review summarizes the up-to-date literature data and
discusses the pharmaceutical potential of different SP extracted from brown, red and
green seaweeds.

Therapeutic potential of sulfated polysaccharides
Researchers across the globe are waking up to the discovery that seaweed-derived
bioactive products are a storehouse of healthy attributes. Recent times have seen a
surge in interest to tap these unexploited marine sources to develop novel
therapeutics. The SP of algal origin have exhibited miraculous biological
properties. The common seaweeds, their SP and observed bioactivity spectra have been
presented in Table 1.Table 1 The studied seaweeds, their bioactive sulfated polysaccharides and

Antioxidant
Souza et al. (2012) isolated a SP
by aqueous extraction from the red seaweed Gracilaria
birdiae and observed that the slimy substance exhibits moderate
antioxidant properties as measured by DPPH free-radical scavenging effect. Veena
et al. (2007) evaluated the efficacy
of fucoidan from edible seaweed Fucus
vesiculosus in Wistar rats (5 mg/kg body wt.). Advocation of the SP
enhanced the antioxidant status, thereby preventing membrane injury and averting
stone formation. Barahona et al. (2011) evaluated the antioxidant capacity of sulfated galactans from
red seaweed Gigartina skottsbergii and
Schizymenia binderi, commercial carrageenans,
and fucoidan from brown seaweed Lessonia vadosa
by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. Fucoidan from L. vadosa and the sulfated galactan from S. binderi exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity.
The antioxidant capacity was also evaluated by ABTS and hydroxyl radical
scavenging assays. Corallinasertularioide, Dictyotacervicornis, Sargassumfilipendula
and Dictyopterisdelicatula were studied and found to have SP having immense
antioxidant potential in the form of total antioxidant, reducing power and ferrous
ion chelating activities (Costa et al. 2010). Two SP fractions rich in galactose and xylose from
Corallina officinalis demonstrated
considerable antioxidant properties (Yang et al. 2011). Hu et al. (2010) isolated two sulfated rhamnose-rich polysaccharide
fractions from Undaria pinnatifida and
evaluated their antioxidant abilities in vitro. It was revealed that the SP
possessed strong antioxidant properties. Ye et al. (2008) evaluated the antioxidant activities of SP from Sargassum pallidum by DPPH
(2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl)-free-radical scavenging assay and reported
activity, though low at the tested concentration. Camara et al. (2011) extracted heterofucans from Canistrocarpus cervicornis by proteolytic digestion
followed by sequential acetone precipitation. The SP exhibited total antioxidant
capacity, low hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, good superoxide radical
scavenging efficiency and excellent ferrous chelating ability. Devaki et al.
(2009) studied the liver
mitochondrial and microsomal fraction from rats to evaluate the antioxidative
effect of oral gavaging with Ulva lactuca
polysaccharide extract (200 mg/kg body weight, daily for 21 days). Electron
microscopy of rat liver tissue intoxicated with d-galactosamine revealed the swelling and loss of mitochondrial
cristae. However, the rats pre-treated with the SP overcame the d-galactosamine challenge without significant
abnormality of TCA, microsomal enzymes and mitochondria structural aberrations.
These results suggested that the SP play crucial role in stabilizing the
functional status of mitochondrial and microsomal membrane by prevention of the
oxidative stress induced by d-galactosamine.
Fucoidan was extracted from Laminaria japonica
through anion-exchange column chromatography and their antioxidant activities were
investigated. Superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, chelating
ability and reducing power analysis showed that all fractions possessed
considerable antioxidant activity (Wang et al. 2008). Gao et al. (2011) investigated the effects of fucoidan on improving learning
and memory impairment in rats induced by infusion of beta-amyloid peptide, Aβ
(1–40) and its possible mechanisms. The results indicated that fucoidan could
ameliorate Aβ-induced cognitive disorders in neural maladies like Alzheimer’s. The
mechanisms appeared to regulate the cholinergic system (increasing the activity of
choline acetyl transferase), reduce the oxidative stress (reduced malondialdehyde
content in hippocampal tissue of brain) and inhibit the cell apoptosis (increase
of Bcl-2/Bax ratio and a decrease of caspase-3 activity). Hong et al.
(2011) investigated the protective
effect of fucoidan on dimethylnitrosamine-induced liver fibrogenesis in rats. When
administered (100 mg/kg, 3 times per week), fucoidan improved liver fibrosis by
inhibiting the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 [TGF-β (1)]/Smad3
and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), and increasing the
expression of metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Fucoidan also significantly decreased
the accumulation of the extracellular matrix and collagen, confirming its
anti-fibrotic effect. Costa et al. (2011b) obtained five sulfated heterofucans from S. filipendula by proteolytic digestion followed by
sequential acetone precipitation, which displayed considerable antioxidant
potential. Magalhaes et al. (2011)
obtained six families of SP from seaweed D.
delicatula employing above-mentioned protocols, followed by molecular
sieving on Sephadex G-100. Some fractions of the heterofucans showed high ferrous
ion chelating activity and some fractions showed reasonable reducing power, about
53.2 % of the activity of vitamin C. These results clearly indicate the beneficial
effects of SP from seaweeds in antioxidant status of consumers.

Antitumor
Vishchuk et al. (2011) isolated
fucoidans from brown seaweeds Saccharina
japonica and U. pinnatifida and
tested their antitumor activity against human breast cancer T-47D and melanoma
SK-MEL-28 cell lines. The highly branched partially acetylated sulfated
galactofucan, built up of (1 → 3)-α-l-fucose
residues from S. japonica and U. pinnatifida distinctly inhibited proliferation and
colony formation in both breast cancer and melanoma cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner. These results indicated that the fucoidan from the studied seaweeds may be
a potential approach toward cancer treatment. After 72-h incubation of HeLa cell
with SP (0.01–2 mg/ml), the proliferation was inhibited between 33.0 and 67.5 % by
S. filipendula; 31.4 and 65.7 % by D.delicatula; 36.3
and 58.4 % by Caulerpaprolifera, and 40.2 and 61.0 % by Dictyotamenstrualis. Costa et al.
(2010) inferred that the
antiproliferative efficacy of SP positively correlated with the sulfate content.
In Sprague–Dawley rats fed with Monostroma
nitidum diet, significant increase in UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 mRNA levels
was found, indicating potential application in chemoprevention medicine (Charles
et al. 2007). Ye et al. (2008) evaluated the antitumor activities of SP
from S. pallidum by MTT
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay, which showed
a significantly high antitumor activity against the human hepatocellular carcinoma
(HepG2), human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial (A549) and human gastric carcinoma
(MGC-803) cells. Croci et al. (2011)
explored the possible antitumor activities of SP from the brown seaweed Laminaria saccharina. The incorporation of the parent
SP and the sulfated fucans into Matrigel plugs containing melanoma cells induced a
significant reduction in hemoglobin content as well as the frequency of
tumor-associated blood vessels. Also, these two SP administrations resulted in a
significant reduction of tumor growth when inoculated into mice. The sulfated
fucan fraction markedly inhibited breast cancer cell adhesion to human
platelet-coated surfaces. Ermakova et al. (2011) showed that fucoidans from brown algae Eclonia cava, Sargassum
hornery and Costaria costata play
an inhibitory role in colony formation in human melanoma and colon cancer cells.
Costa et al. (2011b) observed
antiproliferative activity of fucan from S.
filipendula against HeLa cells by MTT test. The heterofucan was
extracted from the brown seaweed by proteolytic digestion followed by sequential
acetone precipitation. This SP showed antiproliferative activity on Hela cells and
induced apoptosis by mitochondrial release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) into
cytosol. In addition, it decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2
and increased expression of apoptogenic protein Bax. Magalhaes et al.
(2011) obtained six families of SP
from seaweed D. delicatula by proteolytic
digestion, followed by acetone fractionation and molecular sieving on Sephadex
G-100. A fraction of the heterofucan showed high antiproliferative activity
inhibiting almost 100 % of HeLa cell proliferation. Jin et al. (2010) investigated the effects of fucoidan on
the apoptosis of human promyeloid leukemic cells and fucoidan-mediated signaling
pathways. Fucoidan induced apoptosis of human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60),
human promyelocytic (NB4) and THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia) cell line.
Fucoidan treatment of HL-60 cells induced activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3, the
cleavage of Bid, and altered mitochondrial membrane permeability.
Buthionine-[R,S]-sulfoximine rendered HL-60 cells more sensitive to fucoidan. It
was concluded that the activation of MEKK1, MEK1, ERK1/2 and JNK, depletion of
glutathione and production of NO are important mediators in fucoidan-induced
apoptosis of human leukemic cells. Lins et al. (2009) investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor properties
of a SP isolated from the seaweed C.
feldmannii. The SP did not show any significant in vitro cytotoxicity
at the experimental dose, but showed in vivo antitumor effect. The inhibition
rates of sarcoma 180 tumor development were 48.62 and 48.16 % at the doses of 10
and 25 mg/kg, respectively. It also increased the response elicited by anti-cancer
drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) from 48.66 to 68.32 %. Though liver and kidney were
moderately affected, the enzymatic activity of alanine aminotransferase or
urea/creatinine levels was not disturbed. Leucopenia associated with
5-fluorouracil treatment was prevented when the chemotherapeutic was administered
along with SP. An unfractionated fucoidan was extracted from the brown alga
Ascophyllum nodosum and its effect on the
apoptosis of human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells was studied and the signaling
pathways involved were investigated. Fucoidan decreased cell viability and induced
apoptosis of the carcinoma cells, through activation of caspases 9 and 3 and the
cleavage of PARP (Foley et al. 2011).
Haneji et al. (2005) examined the
effect of fucoidan from the brown seaweed Cladosiphon
okamuranus Tokida against an incurable form of cancer, the adult
T-cell leukemia (ATL). It was observed that fucoidan inhibited the growth of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ATL patients and caused apoptosis of
HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines through a cascade of down regulations. In vivo
treatment of the cancer transplanted in mice also showed partial inhibition of the
tumors. Now that, cancer has assumed an epidemic proportion and the treatment
scenario is still bleak, the SP from the marine weeds hold the promise for novel
anticancer formulae.

Immunostimulatory
Water-soluble SP extracted from Enteromorpha
prolifera and fractionated using ion-exchange chromatography was
investigated to determine their in vitro and in vivo immunomodulatory activities.
Some fractions stimulated a macrophage cell line Raw 264.7 inducing considerable
nitric oxide (NO) and various cytokine production via up-regulated mRNA
expression. The in vivo experiment results showed increase in IFN-γ and IL-2
secretions, suggesting that the SP is a strong immunostimulator. It is implied
that the SP can activate T cells by up-regulating Th-1 response (Kim et al.
2011). Lins et al. (2009) demonstrated that SP extracted from
C. feldmannii is an immunomodulatory agent,
evident from the increase in the production of specific antibodies. Kawashima et
al. (2011) demonstrated that fucoidan
enhances the probiotic effects of lactic acid bacteria on immune functions. In
vitro test results showed that fucoidan amplified interferon (IFN)-γ production
mediated by IL-12 production from Peyer’s patch and spleen cells in response to a
strain of LAB, Tetragenococcus halophilus
KK221. In vivo study showed that Th1/Th2 immunobalance was significantly improved
by oral administration of both fucoidan and KK221 to ovalbumin-immunized mice.
Kima and Joo (2008) observed that
fucoidan from F. vesiculosus shows
immunostimulating and maturing effects on dendritic cells (DCs) via a pathway
involving nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). κ-Carrageenan oligosaccharides from red algae
Kappaphycus striatum have immunomodulation
effects on S180 tumor-bearing mice. The sulfated derivative (200 μg/g/day) showed
an increase in natural killer cells (NK cells) up to 76.1 %. It suggested that
chemical modification (especially sulfation) of carrageenan oligosaccharides can
enhance their antitumor effect and boost their antitumor immunity. Yuan et al.
(2011) reported not only the
capacity of SP to elicit cellular immunity but also the importance of chemical
modification of the parent polysaccharide.

Anti-inflammation/antinociception/inhibition of pulmonary
fibrosis
de Araújo et al. (2011) studied
the antiinflammatory and antinociception (less sensitivity to painful stimulus)
properties of seaweed Solieria filiformis in
vivo. Male Swiss mice pre-treated with the SP, on receiving an injection of 0.8 %
acetic acid, 1 % formalin or 30 min prior to a thermal stimulus, showed
significantly reduced number of writhes. It showed antinociceptive action through
a peripheral mechanism; however, did not show any significant anti-inflammatory
effect. The SP from the brown seaweed Spatoglossum
schroederi was assayed for the antinociceptive effect on Swiss mice.
The SP purified by anion-exchange chromatography inhibited both phases of the
formalin test. In the first phase the maximum 45 % reduction in paw licking was
observed. This inhibitory effect suggested a mixed mechanism similar to morphine,
which was not confirmed in the hot-plate test. It was concluded that the
pronounced antinociceptive effect of SP could be developed as a new source of
analgesic drugs (Farias et al. 2011).
The SP galactan extracted from the red marine alga Gelidium crinale was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and
tested by intravenous route in rodent experimental models of inflammation and
nociception. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in the model of rat paw
edema induced by different inflammatory stimuli. Antinociceptive effect was
assessed in models of nociception/hyperalgesia elicited by chemical (formalin
test), thermal (hot plate), and mechanical (von Frey) stimuli in mice. It was
observed that SP inhibited the time course of dextran-induced paw edema and showed
a maximal effect at 1 mg/kg (42 %). At the highest dose, the SP also inhibited the
paw edema induced by histamine (49 %) and phospholipase A(2) (44 %). The galactan
inhibited both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of the formalin test and the
treatment was well tolerated by the test animals (de Sousa et al. 2011a). Hwang et al. (2011) explored SP from brown seaweed Sargassum hemiphyllum for possible anti-inflammatory
effect. The SP was administered against the mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7)
activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The secretion profiles of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and NO, were found significantly to be
reduced in 1–5 mg/ml dose ranges of SP treatments. RT-PCR analysis suggested that
the SP inhibits the LPS-triggered mRNA expressions of IL-β, iNOS and COX-2 in a
dose-dependent manner. It was concluded that the anti-inflammatory properties of
SP may be attributed to the down-regulation of NF-κB in nucleus. Coura et al.
(2011) evaluated the effects of SP
from the red seaweed Gracilaria cornea in
nociceptive and inflammatory mice models. At all tested doses, the SP
significantly reduced nociceptive responses, as measured by the number of writhes.
In a formalin test, the SP significantly reduced licking time in both phases of
the test at a dose of 27 mg/kg. In a hot-plate test, the antinociceptive effect
was observed only in animals treated with 27 mg/kg of SP, suggesting that the
analgesic effect occurs through a central action mechanism at the highest dose.
The lower doses of SP (3 and 9 mg/kg) caused only a slight reduction in neutrophil
migration in the rat peritoneal cavity but significantly inhibited paw edema
induced by carrageenan, especially at 3 h after treatment. Reduction in edema was
confirmed by myeloperoxidase activity in the affected paw tissue. After 14
consecutive days of intraperitoneal administration of the SP (9 mg/kg), the
biochemical, hematological and histopathological evaluations of the internal
organs are performed and no systemic damage was found. de Sousa et al.
(2011b) investigated the
involvement of the hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway in the anti-inflammatory action
of a SP from the red seaweed G. birdiae. The SP
was administered at various concentrations to Wistar rats and observed that at
10 mg/kg concentration, it exerted an anti-inflammatory effect. A remarkable
decrease in leukocytes in the peritoneal cavity was also observed. The SP also
reduced the paw edema induced by carrageenan and inhibited the paw edema induced
by dextran in the first half-hour. The O-sulfated mannoglucuronofucans and sulfated fucan fractions from the
brown seaweed L. saccharina were evaluated for
possible treatment of inflammation in vivo. Both types of SP exhibited inhibition
of leukocyte rush into the sites of inflammation in the murine models (Croci et
al. 2011). Medeiros et al.
(2008) extracted a sulfated
heterofucan from the brown seaweed Lobophora
variegata by proteolytic digestion, followed by acetone
fractionation, molecular sieving, and ion-exchange chromatography. The fucoidan
revealed that it inhibits leukocyte migration to the inflammation site. Ear
swelling caused by croton oil was also inhibited when sulfated polysaccharides
from F. vesiculosus and L. variegata were used. Ananthi et al. (2009) investigated the anti-inflammatory effect
of crude SP from brown alga Turbinaria ornata
against carrageenan-induced paw edema in rats and vascular permeability in mice.
Oral administration of SP reduced the paw edema and showed inhibitory effect on
vascular permeability considerably, in a dose-dependent manner. SP extracted from
brown algae Padina gymnospora showed efficacy
in reducing leukocyte influx into the peritoneal cavity in mice at 10 mg/kg body
weight, causing a decrease of 60 %, without any cytotoxicity (Marques et al.
2012). Idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis is a pathological condition characterized by accumulation of excess
fibroblasts, deposition of collagen and inflammation in lungs. The pro-fibrogenic
cytokine transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) has attracted much
attention for its potential role in the etiology of this serious lung injury.
MS80, a new kind of sulfated oligosaccharide extracted from seaweed, inhibits
TGF-beta1-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and bleomycin-induced pulmonary
fibrosis in vivo. The oligosaccharide competitively inhibited heparin/HS-TGF-beta1
interaction through its high binding affinity for TGF-beta1, also arrested human
embryo pulmonary fibroblast (HEPF) cell proliferation and collagen deposition.
MS80 proved to be a potent suppressor of bleomycin-induced rat pulmonary fibrosis
in vivo (Jiang and Guan 2009). Du et
al. (2010) reported that efficacy of
MS80 lies in targeting the CD40 signal pathway by blocking RIP2. The precise
mechanism of functionality is not clear; nevertheless, the sulfated
polysaccharides studied above promise therapeutic potential in inflammatory
disorders.

Anticoagulation
Batteries of assays for assessment of anticoagulation properties of SP from
seaweeds have been conducted in recent times. Tests ranging from activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT), thrombin time (TT), prothrombin time (PT),
antithrombin to anticoagulation factor Xa activities have been performed and
compared with heparin. Wijesinghe et al. (2011) purified a SP from brown seaweed Ecklonia cava and investigated its anticoagulant activity in vitro
and in vivo. It extended the coagulation time in Wistar rats in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. Costa et al. (2010) evaluated in vitro anticoagulant activities of marine algae
SP by APTT test. D. cervicornis SP prolonged
the coagulation time, only 1.4-fold lesser than
Clexane®, a low molecular weight commercial heparin.
In the prothrombin time (PT) test, which evaluates the extrinsic coagulation
pathway, Caulerpa cupresoides showed
aggression. Codium fragile and Codium vermilara water-soluble sulfated
arabinogalactans prevented coagulation, but they induced platelet aggregation. It
was observed that anticoagulant activity was higher in SP samples with higher
sulfate content. In this regard, C. vermilara
proved to be superior with a higher degree of sulfation and arabinose content
(Ciancia et al. 2007). The hot water
extract of green alga Monostroma latissimum
gives a sulfated rhamnan polysaccharide with an anticoagulant activity. The
anticoagulant activity as evaluated by assays of the APTT and thrombin time
promises that it can be a potential source of anticoagulant (Li et al.
2011). Mao et al. (2008) isolated two sulfated, rhamnose-containing
polysaccharides from marine green algae M.
nitidum and evaluated their anticoagulant activities. The results
showed that both the SP possess high anticoagulant activities, and were potent
thrombin inhibitors mediated by heparin cofactor II. They also hastened thrombin
and coagulation factor Xa inhibition by potentiating antithrombin III. Camara et
al. (2011) extracted sulfated
heterofucans from C. cervicornis which
prolonged APTT. Four sulfated polysaccharides doubled APTT with only 0.1 mg/ml of
plasma, only 1.25-fold less than Clexane®. Albuquerque
et al. (2004) extracted heterofucans
from the brown seaweed D. menstrualis by
proteolytic digestion, followed by sequential acetone precipitation. The
anticoagulant activities of these heterofucans were determined by APTT test. A
fucan fraction (20 g/ml) demonstrated significant anticoagulant activity, about
4.88-fold lesser than Clexane® (4.1 g/ml). Pushpamali
et al. (2008) isolated a highly
sulfated (21.76 %), 100–500 kDa molecular weight galactan anticoagulant from
microbial-fermented freeze-dried red algae Lomentaria
catenata. It demonstrated that the anticoagulant compound showed
better efficacy than heparin and prolonged activity toward APTT and PT assays.
Croci et al. (2011) studied that the
SP from the brown seaweed L. saccharina shows
promising activity on thrombosis. Fernández et al. (2012) studied the anticoagulation efficacy of sulfated
β-d-mannan extracted from green seaweed
C. vermilara and reported that higher sulfate
content leads to more pronounced effect. Fucoidan has been proposed as a potential
substitute of the anticoagulant heparin, with added merits. Unlike mammalian
mucosa-derived heparin, fucoidan is extracted from plants, so less likely to
contain infectious agents, such as viruses or prions (Boisson-Vidal et al.
1995). The current findings promise a host of possible candidates for
natural anticoagulant preparation.

Lipid lowering
Fucoidan has been reported to affect the development of adipocytes. To
elucidate the role of fucoidan in adipogenesis, its inhibitory effect on adipocyte
differentiation via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in
3T3-L1 preadipocytes was studied. Fucoidan treatment inhibited the adipocyte
differentiation, evidenced by decreased lipid accumulation and down-regulation of
adipocyte markers. Also, it inhibited the expression of adipogenic transcription
factors, α (C/EBPα), γ (PPARγ) and AP2, crucial for adipocyte development (Kim et
al. 2010). Sathivel et al.
(2008) evaluated the
anti-peroxidative and anti-hyperlipidemic property of U.
lactuca polysaccharide extract against d-galactosamine (500 mg/kg body weight)-induced anomaly in rat.
d-Galactosamine-intoxicated rats showed
significant liver damage with acute aberration in serum lipid profile, hepatic
protein thiols, deposits of lipid droplets and abnormal appearance of
mitochondria. Rats pretreated with ulvan (30 mg/kg body weight/day/for 21 days)
showed a significant inhibition against abnormality induced by d-galactosamine. The effect of Sargassum polycystum crude SP extract on lipid
metabolism was examined against acetaminophen-induced hyperlipidemia in
experimental rats. The prior oral administration of S.
polycystum (200 mg/kg body wt./day for a period of 15 days) crude SP
extract showed considerable prevention in the severe disturbances of lipid profile
and metabolizing enzymes (serum lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase and hepatic
triglyceride lipase) triggered by acetaminophen. Liver histology also supported
their protective nature against fatty changes induced during acetaminophen
intoxication (Raghavendran et al. 2005). Josephine et al. (2007) studied the possible capacity of SP in normalizing
hyperlipidemia induced by the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine A (25 mg/kg body
weight, orally for 21 days) in Wistar rat kidney. As a side effect of the drug,
lipid profile showed fluctuation resulting in nephrotoxicity manifested by the
enhanced urinary excretion of urea, uric acid and creatinine. The SP-treated
groups (5 mg/kg body weight, subcutaneously) showed a normalized lipid profile and
lipid metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, this group of rats showed a normal
concentration of urinary constituents. Huang et al. (2010) investigated the effect of fucoidan from
L. japonica on hyperlipidemic rats. The SP
reduced the concentration of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol and increased the concentration of high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol of the studied rats. The activities of lipoprotein lipase,
hepatic lipoprotein and lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase were also enhanced.
Above findings corroborate that the SP from seaweeds are ideal option for
effective abatement of the lipid abnormalities.

Antiviral
Many viruses display affinity for cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans
playing crucial role in virus entry. This raises the possibility of the
application of SP in antiviral therapy (Ghosh et al. 2009). Kim et al. (2012) purified a SP, p-KG03, from the red marine
microalga, Gyrodinium impudium. The galactan
conjugated to uronic acid and sulfated groups had showed inhibition of
encephalomyocarditis virus. The inhibitory activity of the SP against influenza
virus was examined. The results of a cytopathic effect reduction assay using MDCK
cells demonstrated that p-KG03 exhibited the 50 % effective concentration (EC50)
values of 0.19–0.48 μg/ml against influenza type A virus infection. The antiviral
activity of p-KG03 was deduced to be directly associated with its interaction with
viral particles, interfering with its adsorption and internalization into host
cell. It was expected to be a candidate for antiviral drug development. The
soluble fractions of a sulfated, (1 → 3)-linked α-d-mannans obtained by hot water extraction from Nemalion helminthoides showed appreciable antiherpetic
activity (Recalde et al. 2009). A
homogeneous branched sulfated heterorhamnan was obtained by aqueous extraction,
followed by ultrafiltration from the green seaweed Gayralia oxysperma which exerted high specific activity against
herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) (Cassolato et al. 2008). Treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1),
the dreaded etiological agent of AIDS poses tough challenges. The limitations
encountered in therapeutic strategy are toxicity, resistance and high costs.
Water-soluble sulfated galactans isolated from two red algae Sphaerococcus coronopifolius (Gigartinales,
Sphaerococcaceae) and Boergeseniella thuyoides
(Ceramiales, Rhodomelaceae) inhibited in vitro replication of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at 12.5 μg/ml. In addition, the studied
polysaccharides were capable of inhibiting the in vitro replication of HSV-1 on
Vero cells. The adsorption step of HSV-1 to the host cell seemed to be the
specific target for the SP action. While for HIV-1, these results suggest a direct
inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication by controlling the appearance of the new
generations of virus and potential virucidal effect (Bouhlal et al. 2011). Ghosh et al. (2009) studied that xylomannan sulfate and its
sulfated derivatives purified from Sebdenia
polydactyla showed strong activity against HSV-1. The IC50 values
were in the range 0.35–2.8 μg/ml and they did not exert cytotoxicity at
concentrations up to 1,000 μg/ml. Many xylogalactofucan- and alginic
acid-containing fractions from marine alga Sphacelaria
indica showed antiherpetic activity. The IC50 values of their
chemically sulfated derivatives against HSV-1 were in the range of 0.6–10 μg/ml
and they lacked cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 200 μg/ml (Bandyopadhyay et
al. 2011). Sulfated fucan-containing
fractions isolated from the brown seaweed Cystoseira
indica showed potent antiviral activity against HSV-1 and 2 HSV-2
without cytotoxicity for Vero cell cultures. Chemical, chromatographic and
spectroscopic methods showed that the anti-herpetic activity of the SP is by
inhibition of the virus adsorption (Mandal et al. 2007). Chattopadhyay et al. (2007) analyzed the SP fractions isolated from crude water extract
of Grateloupia indica and showed their potent
anti-HSV activity. The SP, xylogalactofucan fractions extracted from Laminaria angustata, after addition of sulfate groups
showed enhanced capability to inhibit HSV-1. The IC50 values of these fractions
against HSV-1 were in the range of 0.2–25 μg/ml and they lacked cytotoxicity at
concentrations up to 1,000 μg/ml (Saha et al. 2012). SP fractions from brown seaweed Adenocystis utricularis were analyzed for their in vitro anti-HIV-1
activity. Two of the five studied fractions showed potent anti-HIV-1 activity both
against wild type and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, mediated by blockade of early
events of viral replication (Trinchero et al. 2009). The antiviral activity was dependent on the sulfate
contents of the polysaccharides. Kazłowski et al. (2012) conducted both in vitro and in vivo studies on Japanese
encephalitis virus prevention property of novel SP from Gracilaria sp. and M. nitidum.
During in vitro studies performed by MTT or plaque assays,
low-degree-polymerization SP showed a remarkably high positive effect on
survivability in JEV-infected C3H/HeN mice. The in vivo antiviral activity was
assumed to be a resultant of better absorption of low-DP SP than undigested PS.
The results support the feasibility of antiviral drug development from various SP
and their derivatives.

Antibacterial and antiprotozoan
Kumaran et al. (2010) studied
that SP extracted from red alga Kappaphycus
alvarezii and brown alga Padina
boergessenii exert promising inhibitory response against
antimicrobial-resistant Escherichia coli
strains and, in particular, the inhibitory response of ampicillin-resistant
E. coli, isolated from local fish markets and
seafood processing plants. Maruyama et al. (2007) investigated the effects of fucoidan isolated from the
sporophyll of U. pinnatifida on the Cryptosporidium parvum adhesion to the cultured human
intestinal cells and its infection in neonatal mice. The C. parvum adhesion to human intestinal 407 cells was significantly
suppressed by a low dose (1 mg/ml) of fucoidan (1 μg/ml). The results of the in
vivo experiments revealed that C. parvum
oocysts in the fucoidan-treated mice was reduced to nearly one-fifth of the
oocysts number treated with phosphate buffered saline. It was concluded that
fucoidan might inhibit cryptosporidiosis through the direct binding of fucoidan to
the C. parvum-derived functional mediators in
the intestinal epithelial cells in neonatal mice. Chen et al. (2009) investigated the inhibitory effects of
fucoidan from the edible brown seaweed U.
pinnatifida, on the growth of Plasmodium parasites. The antimalarial
activity of fucoidan was assessed against the cultured Plasmodium falciparum parasites in vitro and on Plasmodium berghei-infected mice in vivo. Fucoidan
significantly inhibited the invasion of erythrocytes by P.
falciparum merozoites. Its 50 % inhibition concentration was similar
to those for the chloroquine-sensitive P.
falciparum 3D7 strain and the chloroquine-resistant K1 strain.
Four-day suppressive testing in P.
berghei-infected mice with fucoidan resulted in a 37 % suppressive
effect versus the control group and a delay in death associated with
anemia.

Prevent hyperplasia
Hlawaty et al. (2011)
investigated the therapeutic potential of low molecular weight fucoidan on
vascular smooth muscle cell and human vascular endothelial cell proliferation and
migration in vitro and in vivo. Sprague–Dawley rats with induced thoracic aorta
injury were treated with SP (5 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Results showed that SP
prevented intimal hyperplasia in rat thoracic aorta. In situ zymography showed
that the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 in the neo-intima is
significantly reduced. Fucoidans have been shown to mobilize bone marrow-derived
progenitor cells via stimulation of stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1 release.
Mobilized progenitor cells have been suggested to repair intimal lesions after
immune-mediated endothelial injury and thus prevent intimal proliferation.
Freguin-Bouilland et al. (2007)
evaluated the therapeutic effect of these SP, in Brown Norway and Lewis rat aortic
allograft model of transplant arteriosclerosis. The recipient rats were treated
with SP (5 mg/kg/day) for 30 days. In contrast to untreated aortic allografts, the
SP-treated allografts showed significantly less intimal proliferation. The SP
treatment stimulated allograft reendothelialization, as evidenced by strong
intimal endothelial nitric oxide synthase antibody and CD31 signals.

Gastrointestinal functions
Graça et al. (2011) showed that a
sulfated galactan isolated from red algae Halymenia
floresia has promising effects on gastrointestinal (GI) motor
functions mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. So,
it is suggested that the SP can be useful when gastrointestinal contraction is
necessary during motility-related disorders. Inflammatory bowel disease caused by
enteric pathogens is a severe form of gastric disease characterized by excess
production of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Fucoidan derived from brown algae
C. okamuranus Tokida imparts LPS tolerance
and prevents the expression of IL-6 mRNA as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo
tests (Matsumoto et al. 2004).

In regenerative and nano medicine
Sezer et al. (2008) prepared a
fucoidan–chitosan hydrogel by swelling the polymers in acidic solution and
investigated its dermal burn treatment efficiency. Dermal burns were inflicted on
male New Zealand white rabbits and the prepared hydrogel was applied on the
wounds. Histopathological evaluation of the biopsy samples was done at intervals.
No edema was seen in tested groups after 3-day treatment and fibroplasia and scar
were fixed after 7-day treatment. The best regeneration on dermal papillary
formation and the fastest closure of the wounds were observed in fucoidan–chitosan
hydrogels after 14-day treatment. Murakami et al. (2010) developed a hydrogel sheet by blending alginate, chitosan
and fucoidan, for rapid wound healing. The hydrogel absorbed Dulbecco’s minimal
essential medium (DMEM) and fluid absorption became constant within 18 h. On
application, this hydrogel is expected to act as tissue adhesive and heal the
wound in a moist milieu. Histological examination showed the advanced granulation
tissue and capillary formation in the healing-impaired wounds treated with the
hydrogel on day 7. Nakamura et al. (2008) reported that a chitosan/fucoidan complex-hydrogel enhanced
the half life of fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) by shielding it against
denaturants as heat and proteolysis. Subcutaneous injection of the
FGF-2-containing complex-hydrogel into the back of mice showed controlled release
of bioactive protein. Slow diffusion of the growth factor induced
neovascularization and fibrous tissue formation near the site of injection after
1 week. The complex-hydrogel was biodegraded after 4 weeks after supplying
adequate amount of the angiogenic agents for protection of the ischemic heart.
Fukuta and Nakamura (2008) reported
that fucoidan and its oligosaccharides have the ability to stimulate production of
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) by induction during translation. So, it is believed
that fucoidan may protect tissues and organs by mechanisms involving HGF.

Toskas et al. (2011) evaluated
the nanofiber ability of an ulvan-rich extract from the alga Ulva rigida. Ulvan-based uniform, crystalline
nanofibers of diameter 84 nm were produced by blending them with poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA). The interesting biological and physicochemical properties of the
nanofibers can lead to new biomedical applications such as drug release systems.
Taken together, these findings indicate that the SP can revolutionize regenerative
and nanomedicine, if exploited properly.

Bottlenecks encountered
Extraction yield differs with respect to species, period and season of seaweed
harvest (Robic et al. 2009). The SP are
extracted from the seaweed biomass by many methods which influence their amount and
chemical composition. The fucans of brown algae are highly complex and heterogeneous
in structure, rendering their study difficult. Fonseca et al. (2008) compared the galactans from two species of
red algae having same structure and size but slight variation in sulfation. Due to
the variation in sulfate content, the two SP differed in their anticoagulant and
venous antithrombotic activities. From the results it was concluded that slight
differences in the proportions of sulfated residues in the galactan chain may be
critical for the interaction between proteases, inhibitors and activators of the
coagulation system. Also, the variations pose challenges in developing therapeutics.
Furthermore, the high molecular weights of SPs pose issue in bio-availability (Jiao
et al. 2011).

Structure–function correlation of SP
It is important to understand the biochemical and molecular mechanism of
therapeutic actions of SP, in order to develop effective drugs. The monomeric
constituents, molecular size, sulfation site, specific structural motif, degree of
branching determination are vital for reproducibility of result. Pomin (2009) has reported that the anticoagulant action
of SP lies in its ability to inhibit plasma proteases via allosteric changes. The
stereospecificities of the carbohydrate–protein complexes hinge on the number of
residues in the repeating units, sulfation pattern, anomeric configuration,
glycosidic linkage position and molecular mass. Also, the heterogeneities, such as
acetylation, methylation and pyruvilation contribute in eliciting variations in
functionality (Bilan et al. 2007). A
single structural change has been traced to result considerable qualitative
difference in results. Pomin and Mourao (2008) reported that preparation of oligosaccharides with
well-defined chemical structures from sulfated fucan helps in the studies of
carbohydrate–protein interaction. Fonseca et al. (2008) reported that algal sulfated galactans have a procoagulant
effect along with the serpin-dependent anticoagulant activity. The procoagulant
effect depends on the sulfation pattern of the SP. Slight differences in the
proportions and/or distribution of sulfated residues along the galactan chain is
critical for the interaction between proteases, inhibitors, and activators of the
coagulation system, resulting in a distinct pattern in anti- and procoagulant
activities. Identification of structural attributes of SP vital for their biological
activities has been limited by their heterogeneous structures. Alasalvar et al.
(2010) reported the strong correlation
between structure of SP and their antioxidant potency. The monomeric constitution,
degree of sulfation and their position, type of glycosidic linkage were held chief
determining factors for variation in activity. High sulfate content and low
molecular size were studied to exert stronger radical scavenging activities.
Frenette and Weiss (2000) determined
that sulfation is critical for efficacy of fucoidan in hematopoietic progenitor
activity. The desulfated fucoidan failed to
promote angiogenesis in vitro or to induce immature CD34+ cell mobilization in vivo.
Fucoidan inhibits the human complement system mediated through interactions with
certain proteins belonging to the classical pathway, particularly the protein C4.
NMR spectra showed that the branched fucoidan oligosaccharides display a better
anticomplementary activity compared to linear structures. Spectroscopy and molecular
modeling of fucoidan oligosaccharides indicated that the presence of side chains
reduces the flexibility of the backbone, mimicking a conformation recognized by the
protein C4 (Clement et al. 2010). Leiro
et al. (2007) observed that
immunostimulatory activity of ulvan-like SP extracted from U. rigida was decreased significantly after desulfation of the SP,
suggesting the importance of the functional group in eliciting immune response. To
tackle the problem of heterogeneity of algal SP, a new approach has been
established. The information obtained from studies of invertebrate SP that have a
regular structure can be used to deduce the functionally of algal SP (Jiao et al.
2011).

Maximization of the extraction and improvement in bioavailability
Aqueous (Ghosh et al. 2009) and
acetone extraction (Marques et al. 2012) are the most prevalent techniques in SP production from
seaweeds. Due to the variations in active growth parameters and extraction
conditions, every new SP purified is a unique compound with signature structural
features, promising a potential new drug. Rodriguez-Jasso et al. (2011) extracted fucoidan from brown seaweed
F. vesiculosus by microwave-assisted
extraction. Extraction at 120 psi, 1 min, using 1 g/25 ml water proved optimum
condition for maximum fucoidan recovery. It was concluded that pressure, extraction
time and alga/water ratio affected the SP yield (Rodriguez-Jasso et al. 2011). Supercritical CO2
extraction, ultrasonic-aid extraction and membrane separation technology may be
applied to harvest SP from the seaweeds. Short extraction times, and non-corrosive
solvents, cost effective an environmentally benign technique are required for
maximum yield. Acid hydrolysis of high molecular weight fucans into low molecular
weight compounds facilitates their structural investigation. Further, the low
molecular weight fucoidans can be obtained by fucoidanase (E.C.3.2.1.44) treatment.
This enzyme sourced from hepatopancreas of invertebrates, marine bacteria and fungi
has an added advantage of hydrolyzing the SP without messing with its side
substitute groups (Qianqian et al. 2011). Endolytic enzymes, such as ulvan lyases isolated from the
flavobacteria Persicivirga ulvanivorans cleave
the glycosidic bond between the sulfated rhamnose and a glucuronic or iduronic acid
in the ulvans (Collen et al. 2011).
Alkali modifications of carrageenans are suggested for improved application
potential (Campo et al. 2009). Success
of commercial reproducibility of highly diverse fucoidan lies in proper
characterization with the help of powerful analytical tools (Fitton 2011).

Conclusion
The research on SP from seaweeds and their wide biological spectrum have
skyrocketed in recent years. Their clinical evaluation for possible noble
therapeutics development is catching momentum like never before. For above goals to
materialize, the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be understood precisely and
elucidated clearly. The relation between structure and function should be unraveled
by intensive studies. This up-to-date review on this emerging technique is expected
to contribute significantly in supplementing background knowledge, kindling interest
for future explorations. Further purification steps and investigation on structural
features as well as in vivo experiments are needed to test the viability of their
use as therapeutic agents. The SP with appreciably few side effects and myriad
benefits could potentially be exploited for complementary medicine use and disease
management.
