indica rice has been established in only a
limited number of cultivars because the regeneration of plants from transformed
embryogenic calli is highly cultivar-specific. Establishment of a highly efficient
plant regeneration system from shoot apex explants applicable to many cultivars of
indica rice will accelerate the application of
transformation technology in breeding programs and functional genomics study. We
established an efficient shoot multiplication and plant regeneration system from
shoot apices of indica rice using thidiazuron
(TDZ) as a plant growth regulator. Shoot apices cultured on MS basal medium devoid
of plant growth regulators formed solitary shoots in 90% of cultures. Addition of
TDZ or benzylaminopurine to regeneration medium significantly influenced formation
of multiple shoots directly from shoot apex explants without an intervening callus
stage. Best shoot proliferation response (10.3 shoots per explant) was recorded when
shoot apices were cultured on media supplemented with 4 mg/l TDZ. No synergistic
effect on shoot proliferation was observed when indole-3-acetic acid and
indole-3-butyric acid were supplemented to media containing 4 mg/l TDZ. The
regeneration system was efficient in evoking multiple shoot proliferation in eight
different cultivars of indica rice. Shoots were
rooted in MS basal medium and plantlets were acclimatized with 100% survival rate.
The shoot apex explants of all the eight cultivars of indica rice were found competent to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation while explants from IR-64 showed
highest transient GUS expression. This variety-independent transformation amenable
regeneration system from shoot apices may widely be applicable for genetic
transformation of indica varieties.

Introduction
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the main staple
food for more than half of the world population. Around 80% of the world rice
production is based on indica varieties, which
are grown under subtropical and tropical conditions as long grain rice, and thus
securing a unique position in agriculture (Khush 1997). It has also become a model monocot system for genetic and
functional genomic studies (Jung et al. 2008). In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the
improvement of important agronomic traits of rice through biotechnological
approaches (Hao et al. 2009;
Skamnioti and Gurr 2009). Genetic
transformation has become an important tool in targeted improvement and gene
function studies in rice (Xu et al. 2012). Most plant regeneration systems adapted to Agrobactrerium-mediated genetic transformation in
indica rice varieties (Rashid et al.
1996; Aldemita and Hodges
1996; Nayak et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 1997; Khanna and Raina 1999, 2002; Mohanty et
al. 2002; Supertana et al. 2005; Ignacimuthu and Arockiasamy 2006) involve regeneration of plants from
transformed embryogenic calli, anther calli (Jiang et al. 2004), and protoplasts. Success in transformation
of indica rice using such regeneration systems
depends on the factors that favor the formation of friable and high quality callus
in a shorter time competent for shoot regeneration. The potential for callus
induction and regeneration have been reported to be variety-dependent, limiting
efficient regeneration in large number of regional indica rice varieties for genetic manipulation (Ali et al.
2004). Moreover, identification of
callus amenable for transformation is cumbersome and the regeneration process is
time consuming. Furthermore, inflorescences and immature embryos are available only
for a limited period in a year because of photoperiodic sensitivity of rice
genotypes. Quick loss of regeneration potential in calli, several stages of
subculture to select the transformed calli, and problems associated with isolation
and sterilization of immature embryos are the serious limitations for use of these
explants in transformation (Kishore et al. 2006).

Use of shoot apex for successful genetic transformation through both Agrobacterium and biolostic methods is reported in many
cereals including rice (Sticklen and Oraby 2005). A major advantage with shoot apex for genetic transformation
is its developmental plasticity which allows rapid and direct regeneration of
transgenic plants from transformed shoot apices ensuring cultivar integrity and
circumventing the appearance of cell culture induced mutations (Hirochika et al.
1996; Bao et al. 2001). Manipulation of transgenic meristematic
cells in shoot apices by treatment with growth regulators for induction of multiple
shoots is most attractive for generation of stable transformants. Thidiazuron (TDZ),
a phenylurea-type cytokinin, has been reported to facilitate efficient
multiplication of apical meristem cells and their reprogramming to appropriate
developmental stage for shoot differentiation (Gairi and Rashid 2004; Goldman et al. 2003; Srivatanakul et al. 2000). However, to our knowledge, plant regeneration from shoot
apex is available only for two varieties, White Ponni (WP) and Pusa Basmati 1 (PB1)
of Indian origin (Arockiasamy and Ignacimuthu 2007) of indica rice.

We report establishment of an efficient plant regeneration system from shoot
apices of indica rice applicable to eight
cultivars using TDZ as a growth regulator and demonstrate their amenability to
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

Materials and methods
Plant material and explant preparation
Seeds of eight indica rice cultivars IR-64,
Anjali, Vandana, Chandan, Mahasuri, Nilagiri, Ranjit, and Luit having superior
attributes including good grain quality and varying levels of disease resistance
were obtained from Regional Rainfed Low Land Rice Research Station, Gerua, Assam,
India. The cultivar IR-64 was used as a model for indica rice shoot apex regeneration and transformation experiments.
Mature seeds were dehusked, surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 30 s, rinsed
with 1% bavistin, and 0.2% HgCl2 (w/v) for 5 min each. The
seeds were then rinsed five times with sterile double distilled water and cultured
on MS basal medium (Murashige and Skoog 1962) with 3% sucrose supplemented with or without 1 mg/l TDZ.
Shoot apices (4–5 mm) were carefully excised from the four-day-old germinated
seedlings and used for all experiments.

Multiple shoot induction and plant regeneration
In order to study the effect of most potential cytokinins, benzylaminopurine
(BAP) and TDZ on multiple shoot induction, shoot apices of indica rice cultivar IR-64 were cultured on MS medium supplemented
with different concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mg/l) of TDZ or BAP. The
regenerating explants were subcultured twice onto fresh media at an interval of
15 days each. The efficiency of multiple shoot induction and plant regeneration
were evaluated by scoring the mean number of shoots induced from responding
explant, and measuring the mean shoot length. Regeneration frequency was
calculated based on the number of shoot apices responding to regeneration by total
number of shoot apices cultured.

The synergistic effect of auxin with 4 mg/l TDZ on shoot proliferation was
examined by supplementing different concentrations (0.025, 0.1 and 0.25 mg/l) of
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) to MS medium containing
4 mg/l TDZ. The regenerating explants were subcultured following the methods
described earlier. Percentage of regeneration, mean number of shoots, and average
shoot length were recorded. All media were adjusted to pH 5.8 with 0.1 N NaOH or
0.1 N HCl prior to addition of 0.7% agar–agar (Hi-media, Mumbai), and autoclaving
at 20 psi and 121 °C for 20 min.

Effect of genotype
The effect of genotype on multiple shoot induction and plant regeneration from
shoot apices was studied by culturing shoot apex explants of indica rice cultivars, Anjali, Vandana, Chandan,
Mahasuri, Nilagiri, Ranjit, and Luit in MS medium supplemented with 4 mg/l TDZ.
The number of regeneration responsive explants, mean number of shoots, and average
shoot length were recorded. The relative frequency of plant regeneration and
efficiency of multiple shoot induction were compared among all cultivars.

Rooting and transplantation
The shoots (5–7 cm) were separated from multiple shoot clumps and transferred
to MS medium devoid of growth regulator for 2 weeks for root formation.
Subsequently plantlets with well-developed root system were washed in tap water
and acclimatized in polybags containing soil and vermicompost (1:1), covered with
transparent polybags at 27 °C and 16 h photoperiod for 14 days. Finally, the
hardened plants were transferred to pots containing soil and established in a
green house.

Culture conditions
All cultures were maintained under the same experimental conditions at
25 ± 2 °C under white fluorescent light at irradiance of
37.5 μmol/m2/s with 16-h photoperiod. Visual
observations of the cultures were taken every week, and the percentage of cultures
showing regeneration, number of shoots per explant, and shoot length were recorded
after 30 days.

Transformation procedure and GUS assay
Agrobacterium tumefactions strain EHA105
harboring a binary vector pCAMBIA2301pyl13
which contains a ABA receptor gene (pyl13),
β-glucuronidase (gus) interrupted with an
intron in the coding region and neomycin phosphotransferase (nptII) genes, all driven by CaMV35S promoter
(Fig. 1), was used for transformation
studies. The bacteria was grown on YEP (10 g/l yeast extract, 10 g/l peptone,
50 g/l NaCl, 15 g/l agar–agar and pH 7.0–7.2) solid medium containing 50 mg/l
kanamycin and 10 mg/l rifampicin at 28 °C. A single bacterial colony was
inoculated into 2 ml of liquid AB medium containing 5 mg/l rifampicin and 25 mg/l
kanamycin and grown overnight on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm at 28 °C. Bacteria
were pelleted at 5,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in liquid MS medium
containing 100 μM acetosyringone at a density of OD600 = 1.
Shoots apices excised from 4-day-old seedlings were gently stabbed four to five
times using a sterile needle (24 G) at apex region before being immersed in
bacterial suspension for 30 min with shaking at 80 rpm at 25 °C. Inoculated
explants were blotted on sterile filter paper and co-cultivated on solid MS medium
containing 1 mg/l TDZ and 100 μM acetosyringone for 3 days at 25 °C under dark
condition. After co-cultivation, the explants were washed three to four times with
sterile double distilled water by vigorous stirring, blotted dry on sterile filter
paper and 20 explants were tested for transient gus expression by histochemical assay using
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl glucuronide (X-Gluc) as a substrate (Jefferson et al.
1987). The explants were then
visually scored for transient gus
activity.Fig. 1 T-DNA region of pCAMBIA2301Atpyl13 (12 kb). The 495 bp (EcoRI–HindIII) fragment

Regeneration of transgenic plants
Following co-cultivation, the explants were washed three to four times with
sterile double distilled water by vigorous stirring, blotted dry on sterile filter
paper and were cultured on selection medium (MS medium containing 4 mg/l TDZ,
45 mg/l kanamycin, and 500 mg/l cefotaxime) for induction and selective
regeneration of transformants. The cultures were transferred to fresh selection
medium at an interval of 15 days. Same levels of antibiotics were maintained
during subsequent subcultures. After 4 weeks of culture on selection, the
proliferating kanamycin resistant shoots (>5 cm) were transferred to rooting
medium (MS medium containing 500 mg/l cefotaxime). The putative transformed plants
were established in soil:compost (1:1) and grown to maturity in transgenic
greenhouse containment.

Molecular analysis of transformed plants by PCR
Genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves of transformed and untransformed
(control) plants by modified CTAB method (Solleti et al. 2008). PCR analysis was carried out for
gus gene to amplify 570 bp internal fragment
using 18 mers (gus Fw: CTGTGGGCATTCAGTCTG; Rv:
ACGCTGACATCACCATTG) primers. To rule out the possibility of Agrobacterium contamination, PCR was performed to check
for amplification of 760 bp fragment of the bacterial virulence gene (virG) located outside the T-DNA using 21 mers (Fw:
ATGGCTGGCCAGGATCCTAGA; Rv: TCAGGCCGCCATCACACC) primers. The amplification reaction
was carried out under the following conditions: 94 °C for 5 min (1 cycle), 94 °C
for 1 min (denaturation), 58 °C for 1 min (annealing), 72 °C for 1 min (extension)
for 35 cycles followed by the final extension at 72 °C for 7 min (1 cycle). PCR
was performed using ~100 ng of purified genomic DNA, 50 ng plasmid DNA
(pCAMBIA2301Atpyl13 as positive control), and
Taq DNA polymerase (Genei, Bangalore, India) according to manufacturer’s
instruction. The negative and untransformed plant controls were set up with no DNA
and untransformed rice plant DNA, respectively. The amplified products were
resolved by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining (Sambrook et al. 1989).

Statistical analysis
Data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and mean separation by
Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) using single-factor completely randomized
block design to study the effect of different treatments on shoot proliferation
and frequencies of transient expression. All experiments were performed at least
three times with a minimum of 30–40 explants per treatment.

Result and discussion
A prolific regeneration system based on multiple shoot induction from isolated
shoot apices permits quicker plant regeneration owing to their extensive
proliferative ability and presents amenability to germline transformation.
Furthermore, use of shoot apices from in vitro germinated seedlings facilitates
availability of explants round the year. We developed an efficient and reproducible
plant regeneration system from isolated shoot apices of indica rice by use of a synthetic urea-cytokinin, thidiazuron (TDZ).
The regeneration system was found applicable to eight indica rice cultivars investigated in this study and amenable to
Agrobacterium-mediated transformation.

Effect of TDZ on shoot multiplication
The morphogenic potential of shoot apices of the eight indica rice cultivars was analyzed on MS medium augmented with
various concentrations of TDZ and BAP. The efficiency of shoot induction from
shoot apices on growth regulator free MS medium was considered as control. Shoot
apices (Fig. 2a) cultured on MS medium
formed a solitary shoot without callus formation at the base in 90% of responding
explants (Table 1) within 2 weeks of
culture. However, inclusion of various concentrations (1–5 mg/l) of TDZ and BAP in
basal medium elicited a prime and distinct role in shoot buds differentiation
within 2 weeks of culture. One of the main functions of cytokinin is known to
confer morphogenic competence for initiation of shoot proliferation. However, the
type and concentration of cytokinin influenced the regeneration frequency, average
number of shoots produced per explant, and mean length of the shoots
(Table 1). Although, addition of both
TDZ and BAP into medium resulted in induction of multiple shoots, but the effect
of TDZ was more pronounced than BAP at equimolar concentrations
(Table 1). Of the different
concentrations of TDZ and BAP tested, 4 mg/l TDZ was found to be most effective in
inducing multiple shoot induction from the shoot apices by producing maximum of
10.3 shoots per explant in 89% of cultures (Table 1; Fig. 2b, c). A linear
correlation between increases in TDZ concentration to an optimal dose (4 mg/l) and
regeneration frequency as well as mean shoot number was recorded
(Table 1). Thidiazuron, a
phenylurea-based compound has shown to possess potent activity as a cytokinin in
inducing efficient multiple shoot formation in several plant species (Huetteman
and Preece 1993, Srivatanakul et al.
2000; Mithila et al.2001;
Goldman et al. 2003; Gairi and Rashid
2004; Faisal et al. 2005; D’Onofrio and Morini 2005; Radhika et al. 2006; Siddique and Anis 2007). Higher concentration of TDZ (5 mg/l)
resulted in a decrease in regeneration frequency, mean shoot number, and shoot
length indicating suppression of shoot proliferation (Table 1). Furthermore, stunted shoot growth was recorded at
5 mg/l TDZ as the shoot buds appeared to be developmentally suppressed. Unlike
BAP, an adenine and purine based cytokinin, TDZ is resistant to cytokinin
degrading enzymes, and therefore at high dose remains persistent in the tissues
inducing excessive suppression of shoot buds, consequently leading to reduced
proliferation rates (Huetteman and Preece 1993). In comparison to TDZ, shoots induced on BAP containing
medium were longer and slender.Fig. 2 Multiple shoot induction and plant regeneration from apical

Effective multiple shoot induction and shoot proliferation is often the
manifestation of interactions among physiological state of the explants and a
combination of plant growth regulators (Mallikarjuna and Rajendrudu 2007). In our study, we evaluated the effect of
different concentrations of IAA and IBA in combination with optimal dose of TDZ
(4 mg/l) on enhancement of multiple shoot induction from shoot apices. However, no
incremental increase in regeneration frequency as well as mean shoot number was
observed indicating the absence of synergistic effects of IAA and IBA with TDZ on
cultured shoot apices of indica rice cultivars
in our study (Table 2). Our results are
contrary to the report on effective multiple shoot formation through the use of a
combination of cytokinins, TDZ and BAP with auxins in immature embryo of another
cereal, sorghum (Pola et al. 2007;
Kishore et al. 2006). Hormonal
metabolisms are known to be operated in an integrated manner (Gaspar et al.
2000) and that several, potential,
mutual functional interacting points exist between different hormones (Coenen and
Lomax 1997). Both synergic as well as
antagonistic effects among plant growth regulators have been reported in effecting
shoot proliferation in in vitro cultures.Table 2 Effect of different auxins in combination with 4 mg/l TDZ on

After 4 weeks on multiple shoot induction medium, individual shoots were
separated from each other and transferred to MS medium where they rooted within
2 weeks of culture (Fig. 2d). Over 100% of
rooted plantlets survived when established in soil (Fig. 2e). The plants resumed growth in greenhouse reaching maturity
and represented no phenotypic variation or sterility, irrespective of cultivars
tested.

Genotype influences on tissue culture response
It is known that the potential for multiple shoot induction and plant
regeneration in rice depends on a number of factors of which genotype of the donor
plant and interaction between genotype and shoot proliferation medium are most
important. Therefore, in the present study eight indica rice cultivars were screened to evaluate the genotype
influence on shoot proliferation and plant regeneration. The study showed the
sensitivities of different indica rice
cultivars to the optimal shoot proliferation medium. The shoot apices of cultivars
IR-64, Mahasuri, and Nilagiri showed significantly greater shoot proliferation
response than the other five cultivars on MS medium containing 4 mg/l TDZ
(Table 3). However, no significant
variation in regeneration frequency as well as mean shoot number was detected
among the five cultivars, Ranjit, Vandana, Luit, Anjali, and Chandana
(Table 3). Although, shoot apices
indica rice cultivars IR-64, Mahasuri, and
Nilagiri showed significantly greater shoot proliferation response, other five
cultivars also responded to multiple shoot proliferation. Regeneration of
different indica rice cultivars on the medium
showed the technique is genotype-independent. Although a large number of protocols
are available for embryogenic calli-mediated plant regeneration in indica rice, they are mostly genotype-dependent and
furthermore, no universal medium adaptable to a number of indica rice genotypes has been developed. Furthermore, multiple
shoots developed directly from the meristem without an intervening callus stage in
the present protocol is expected to maintain genotype fidelity that could be lost
with shoots arising from callus.Table 3 Shoot multiplication and plant regeneration from shoot apices of

Shoot apex transformation and gus
expression
It is generally known that genotype remains the major limiting factor
restricting successful transformation in indica
rice (Ge et al. 2006). The shoot
meristem based plant regeneration system is mostly genotype-independent and
provides a potential target for T-DNA delivery by Agrobacterium and direct gene transfer method (Sticklen and Oraby
2005). Another major advantage
using the shoot apex explants is that rapid regeneration of shoots can be achieved
from transformed shoot apices unlike shoot regeneration from transformed calli and
protoplasts which involve several rounds of subculture involving risk of
generating mutations (Arockiasamy and Ignacimuthu 2007). To determine the competency of the shoot apex explants of
eight indica rice cultivars to Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation,
experiments were carried out to inoculate explants with A.
tumefaciens. 3 days after coculture, explants were incubated with
substrate for β-glucuronidase enzyme and assayed for gus expression. Strong transient gus expression was detected in the region of the shoot apices from
where the shoots developed, i.e., apex region (Fig. 3a). The endogenous GUS activity (color) was not detected in
non-transformed (control) explants (Fig. 3b). GUS activity at the regenerating sites indicated the
amenability of explants to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Although, shoot apices of all
the indica rice cultivars showed strong
gus expression at the regenerating site,
however, transient gus expression efficiency
differed from cultivar to cultivar (Fig. 4). Highest transient gus
expression efficiency was recorded in cultivar IR-64 in which 100% of shoot apex
explants showed gus expression
(Fig. 4). Our results demonstrated that
shoot apex explants of eight indica rice
cultivars are amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and combined with their shoot
proliferation ability could lead to regeneration of stable transgenic plants in a
genotype-independent fashion. Transformation of the shoot apex is advantageous as
a region of the shoot apex differentiates into the germline, which gives rise to
the seed enabling transfer of the trait to the progeny. Shoot apices in
conjunction with Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation have been used to develop transgenic plants in two indica rice cultivars of Indian origin, WP and PB1
(Arockiasamy and Ignacimuthu 2007).
Shoot apex-based regeneration systems have also been employed successfully to
recover stably transformed maize, wheat, oat, barley, sorghum, and millet
(Sticklen and Oraby 2005) and finger
millet (Antony Ceasar and Ignacimuthu 2011).Fig. 3 Transient GUS expression at the regenerating sites of shoot apex

Molecular analysis of transgenic plants
The PCR analysis detected the presence of the expected 570 bp amplified
product corresponding to gus (Fig. 5) in transformed shoots. No amplification was
detected in the control untransformed shoots. Furthermore, the absence of signals
in PCR by using virG primer in transformed
shoots ruled out artefacts caused by A.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have established rapid multiple shoot induction and efficient
plant regeneration method from shoot apices of eight indica rice cultivars in a genotype-independent manner. The system was
found amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated
transformation in all the eight indica rice
cultivars included in the study as evident from gus expression in transformed shoot apices and presence of gus gene in transformed plants by PCR analysis. This
simple, rapid, and efficient plant regeneration system amenable to Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of eight indica rice cultivars may accelerate varietal development
program through transgenic approach by incorporation of key candidate genes and for
