Differentially expressed genes via integrating five microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained. The gene function and involved pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by GeneCodis3. Transcription factors (TFs) targeting top 20 dysregulated DEGs (including up- and downregulated genes) were found based on the TRANSFAC. A total of 1339 DEGs were detected including 788 upregulated and 551 downregulated genes. These genes were mostly involved in DNA-dependent transcription regulation, blood coagulation, and innate immune response, pathogenic escherichia coli infection, epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection, and chemokine signaling pathway. TFs bioinformatic analysis of 20 DEGs generated 374 pairs of TF-target gene involving 47 TFs. At last, we found that five top ten upregulated DEGs (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, PGLYRP1 and MMP9) and three downregulated DEGs (ZNF84, CYB561A3 and BST1) were under the regulation of three hub TFs of Pax-4, POU2F1, and Nkx2–5. The identified eight DEGs may be regarded as the diagnosis marker and drug target for sepsis.

Introduction
Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome induced by the interaction between the host and pathogens products, such as endotoxin and the host immune system (Brunkhorst and Reinhart 2009). Sepsis leads to various organ dysfunctions including acute renal, liver injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome which is the main cause of increased mortality in patients (de Montmollin and Annane 2011). Although great process is performed in various researches, the pathological mechanism of sepsis remains unclear. Additionally, the incidence and mortality of sepsis are still high (Angus et al. 2001; Annane et al. 2003). Thus, discovery of important mediators involved in the process of sepsis is urgently needed.

Microarray strategies (Calvano et al. 2005) seem to be a powerful option for finding crucial mediators involving in disease of humans. Based on the superiority of large sample and reliable result, integration analysis of multiple microarrays may be useful to provide evidence for understanding the mechanism of sepsis. Additionally, the TFs and its target genes have been the study focus of system biology. The regulatory network between TFs and target genes is valuable in the field of biomedicine. Several TFs such as NF-κB, AP1, p53, PPAR, CREB, STAT, and E2F were closely related to some important diseases (inflammation and cancer) (Hoesel and Schmid 2013; Kesh et al. 2015; Lopez-Bergami et al. 2010; Mullen and Gonzalez-Perez 2016; Pal et al. 2014; Ramana et al. 2010; Wang and DuBois 2010). This may provide the drug target for different diseases.

In this study, we conducted an integrated analysis of sepsis microarray data, and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between sepsis and normal control samples. Moreover, we also obtained significantly enriched functions of these DEGs to reveal the biological processes and signaling pathways associated with sepsis. Finally, some transcription factors (TFs) that targeted top 20 DEGs were found. We hope that this integrated analysis may provide additional understanding of sepsis that was helpful to explore novel diagnostic marker of sepsis and drug targets for future therapeutic tests.

Materials and methods
Microarray data
In this study, we searched datasets from the GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database with the keywords “sepsis” [MeSH Terms] or sepsis [All Fields] and “Homo sapiens” [porgn] AND “gse” [Filter]. The study type was described as “expression profiling by array.” All selected datasets were genome-wide expression sequencing data in blood of sepsis group and/or normal group (no drug stimulation or being transfected treatment) samples. And these datasets were standardized and original, and were downloaded by R (3.2.1) GEO query. Finally, there were five datasets obtained in this study.

Detection of DEGs and meta-analysis
Limmapackage (3.2.1) (Diboun et al. 2006) and Meta-MA package were used to identify the DEGs between sepsis and normal group. Limma is used to calculate the P value and FDR value of one gene in one dataset. The metaMA is applied to combine the P values of one gene in different datasets by inverse normal method. The gene with FDR < 0.05 was deemed to indicate a DEG.

Functional and biological pathway analysis of DEGs
In order to investigate the functional changes of DEGs, the gene function annotation analysis tool GeneCodis3 (http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es/analysis/) (Tabas-Madrid et al. 2012) was used to find the biological meaning of groups of genes, including gene ontology (GO) categories (Young et al. 2010) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway annotation (Kanehisa and Goto 2000).

Analysis of potential TFs to target DEGs
TFs play an important role in regulating gene expression. We downloaded the TFs in the human genome and the motifs of genomic binding sites from the TRANSFAC (Wingender 2008). Moreover, the 2 KB sequence in the upstream promoter region of DEGs was downloaded from UCSC (http://www.genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables). Target TFs were subsequently obtained by the method of minimize false-positive matches. Finally, the transcriptional regulatory network was visualized by cytoscape software (Smoot et al. 2011).

Results
Identification of DEGs in sepsis
We downloaded five gene expression datasets of sepsis from microarray experiments. GEO IDs were GSE69528, GSE67652, GSE57065, GSE26378, and GSE26440. In summary, there were 293 sepsis samples and 118 normal samples, respectively. The characteristics of these five datasets are provided in Table 1. Based on the integrated analysis of five microarray datasets, 8332 genes were identified. A total of 1339 DEGs were screened under the statistical significance threshold of FDR < 0.05. Among which, there were 788 upregulated and 551 downregulated DEGs. The heat map of top 100 DEGs is shown in Fig. 1. And the heat map of sample clustering is shown in supplementary Fig. 1. The top ten upregulated or downregulated DEGs between sepsis and normal sample are shown in Table 2.Table 1 Characteristics of the five microarray datasets for integrated analysis

GO enrichment and KEGG signaling pathway analysis of DEGs
Among 1339 DEGs, a total of 1243 DEGs were recognized in GO and KEGG signaling pathway enrichment analysis. GO enrichment analysis showed that these DEGs were significantly enriched in the apoptotic process (GO: 0006915, FDR = 4.78E−14), mitotic cell cycle (GO: 0000278, FDR = 4.44E−09), regulation of transcription depending on DNA (GO: 0006355, FDR = 4.51E−09), blood coagulation (GO: 0007596, FDR = 3.80E−07), innate immune response (GO: 0045087, FDR = 6.18E−07) and so on under the biological process category. The top fifteen significantly enriched GO functions of DEGs are listed in Table 3. Furthermore, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these DEGs were significantly involved in huntington’s disease (FDR = 9.50E−09), alzheimer’s disease (FDR = 1.01E−08), pathogenic escherichia coli infection (FDR = 1.61E−07), phagosome (FDR = 1.74E−07), epithelial cell signaling in helicobacter pylori infection (FDR = 3.57E−07), parkinson’s disease (FDR = 9.47E−07), and chemokine signaling pathway (FDR = 1.75E−05).

Establishment of TF-target genes regulatory network for sepsis
In order to disclose the TF-target genes′ regulatory network for sepsis, we utilized TRANSFAC to obtain TFs regulating top 20 upregulated or downregulated DEGs. Finally, we obtained transcriptional regulatory networks consisting of 374 pairs of TFs genes involving 47 TFs. In the network, the three most downstream genes covered by TFs were ZNF84, CYB561A3, and BST1. The three hub TFs were Pax-4 (degree = 13), POU2F1 (degree = 12), and Nkx2–5 (degree = 11) (Table 5). Among the top 20 upregulated or downregulated DEGs, five upregulated genes (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, PGLYRP1, and MMP9) and three downregulated genes (ZNF84, CYB561A3, and BST1) were co-regulated by Pax-4, POU2F1, and Nkx2–5.Table 5 Top eight TFs targeting more than five DEGs

Discussion
Sepsis is associated with substantial morbidity and is a rapidly growing public health concern in older people. The understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis will lead to new therapies that improve survival. TF-target genes′ regulatory network may be available to investigate the underlying mechanisms and provide additional evidence for the therapeutic method of sepsis. In our study, based on the integrated analysis of five microarray datasets for sepsis, we identified 1339 DEGs including 788 upregulated and 551 downregulated DEGs. It is well known that inflammation is a fundamental component of sepsis pathogenesis and severe sepsis is associated with blood coagulation and immune system dysfunctions. In this study, these DEGs were significantly enriched in the GO term for biological processes especially in regulation of blood coagulation and innate immune response. Furthermore, the KEGG pathway of pathogenic escherichia coli infection was also significantly enriched. At last, we found that five top ten upregulated DEGs (S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, PGLYRP1, and MMP9) and three downregulated DEGs (ZNF84, CYB561A3, and BST1) were under the regulation of the three hub TFs of Pax-4, POU2F1, and Nkx2–5. These eight DEGs played a significant role in sepsis.

As the family members of S100 proteins, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 have relationship with inflammatory diseases and aggravate inflammatory response (Roth et al. 2003). The heterodimer S100A8/A9, also known as calprotectin, is elevated in the circulation and has been severed as a potential diagnostic marker of sepsis (Terrin et al. 2011). S100A12 released from granulocytosis is over-expressed and can activate human monocytes via toll-like receptor 4 during clinical and experimental sepsis (Foell et al. 2013). In this study, S100A8, S100A9, and S100A12 were upregulated in sepsis, which were in accordance with the previous reports.

PGLYRP1 (also called PGRP-S) is said to be participated in neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species, as well as regulation of immune responses in vivo (Dziarski et al. 2003; Park et al. 2013). It is strongly expressed in bone marrow and polymorphonuclear leukocytes and has direct antibacterial effect in vitro (Kang et al. 1998; Liu et al. 2000, 2001; Tydell et al. 2002). In our study, we found PGLYRP1 was upregulated, which may result in dysfunction of immune response in sepsis.

MMP9 is a multi-domain zinc metalloproteinase released by inflammatory cells. MMP9 regulates the activity of numerous cytokines that are critical to inflammation (Galliera et al. 2015; Vandooren et al. 2013). It is noted that MMP9 levels in plasma are elevated in patients with septic shock and severe sepsis, and it may cause severe sepsis (Nakamura et al. 1998). In this study, we found that MMP9 was upregulated in sepsis that was consistent with previous reports.

Zincfinger (ZNF) genes are the largest family of TFs in mammalian genomes. It is suggested that ZNF84 is upregulated in mature MII oocytes and human ES cells compared the gene expression profile of somatic tissues (Assou et al. 2009). However, very few researches about ZNF84 existed in sepsis. In this study, the expression of ZNF84 decreased, which may serve as a novel insight into the relationship between ZNF84 and sepsis.

In mammals, lysosome cytochrome b561 (CYB561A3) is expressed at the plasma membrane and intracellular sites (McKie et al. 2001). Lysosome iron pools play an important part in oxidative stress (Kurz et al. 2006), which involves CYB561A3-Fe3+-reductase activity. It is pointed out that the expression of CYB561A3 is found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Yepes et al. 2015). In this study, we found that CYB561A3 was downregulated and may have a role of oxidative stress in sepsis.

Bone marrow stromal cell antigen-1 (BST1, also called CD157) is highly conserved and has been found in organisms of mammals. BST1 plays numerous roles in humoral immune response, neutrophil transmigration, and hematopoietic stem cell support (Ishihara and Hirano 2000). It is reported that BST1 is involved in inflammatory pathways of alzheimer’s disease (Chang et al. 2015). Also, BST1 is expressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma and its high expression is associated with variations in tumor cell morphology, decreased cell–cell interactions, motility, and mesothelial invasion (Morone et al. 2012). Herein, we found that the expression of BST1 was reduced and may be involved in sepsis via mediating immune response.

Depending on the results of TF-target genes regulation network, we identified 47 TFs in sepsis. In the network, top three TFs regulating the most downstream target genes were Pax-4, POU2F1, and Nkx2–5. Pax-4 belongs to the PAX family and contains the paired domain and homeodomain (Inoue et al. 1998; Walther et al. 1991), which are potential DNA-binding domains. POU family is a class of DNA-binding transcription factors that function in cell specification and developmental regulation (Phillips and Luisi 2000; Ryan and Rosenfeld 1997). POU2F1 is a member of the POU family that has been reported as being both a positive and negative regulator of transcription and can regulate transcription by interacting with other transcription factors (Mordvinov et al. 1999). The homeobox transcription factor Nkx2–5 is a critical regulator of cardiac gene expression and heart development (Komuro and Izumo 1993; Lints et al. 1993). The regulation of these three TFs for above eight DEGs also played a part in the process of sepsis.

In a word, our integrated analysis found a number of DEGs in sepsis. Furthermore, the results of GO enrichment analysis and KEGG signal pathway analysis revealed that some biological functions or pathways may be closely linked to the development of sepsis. The constructed transcriptional regulatory network uncovered top three TFs (Pax-4, POU2F1, and Nkx2–5) regulating most downstream target genes including S100A8, S100A9, S100A12, PGLYRP1, MMP9 ZNF84, CYB561A3, and BST1. All these genes appeared to play vital roles in the development of disease and may therefore be potential diagnostic marker of sepsis and drug targets for the treatment of sepsis.
