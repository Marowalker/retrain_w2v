transportation purpose. Commercial production of lignocellulosic bioethanol mainly
depends on cost of cellulase production, efficient pretreatment and enzymatic
hydrolysis process. In the present study cellulase production from Aspergillus niger under submerged fermentation (SmF) was
optimized using coconut water as natural medium. Maximum cellulase production
(0.53 IU/mL) was achieved within 3 days of incubation using 8 % (w/v) waste paper
and 0.07 % (w/v) glucose. The produced cellulase was applied for enzymatic
hydrolysis of thermo chemically (dilute acid and alkaline) pretreated biomass (equal
mixture of wheat straw and cotton stalk). Optimization of dilute acid and dilute
alkaline pretreatment showed dilute alkaline pretreatment was more effective for
higher reducing sugar production. Maximum reducing sugar yield of 398.0 mg/g dry
biomass was obtained from dilute alkaline pretreated biomass (using 0.5 M sodium
hydroxide, 8 % substrate concentration, 120 °C temperature and 20 min of incubation
time). The presence of difference sugars (glucose, xylose, mannose, maltose) in the
saccharified sample was confirmed by thin layer chromatographic analysis. The
effectiveness of dilute alkaline pretreatment was further confirmed by biochemical
composition (cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin) and structural (furrier
transformed infrared spectroscopic and scanning electron microscopic) analysis. The
above result can be useful for commercial production of lignocellulosic
bioethanol.

Introduction
Biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass has several attractive
features such as high availability, no competition with food chain and abundant in
supply. Lignocellulosic biomass mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and
lignin. For biofuel production, there needs hydrolysis of carbohydrates (cellulose
and hemicelluloses) portion of lignocellulosic biomass (Khare et al. 2015). Prior to hydrolysis most lignocellulosic
substrates need to undergo some sort of pretreatment to enhance the accessibility of
the substrate for efficient hydrolysis and biofuel production. Thermo chemical
pretreatment is one such process. It has several advantages such as efficient lignin
removal within shorter incubation time and high sugar yield (Chen et al.
2013; Singh and Trivedi 2013). Akanksha et al. (2014) reported optimization of dilute acid
pretreatment of sorghum biomass. They found maximum reducing sugar yield (0.408 g
reducing sugar/g of biomass) when biomass was pretreated using 0.37 % sulphuric acid
at 150 °C for 15 min. McIntosh and Vancov (2011), reported enzymatic hydrolysis of dilute alkaline pretreated
wheat straw. Pretreating biomass using 2 % sodium hydroxide for 30 min at 121 °C,
increased the reducing sugar yield up to 6.3 fold compared to control biomass. After
pretreatment, enzymatic hydrolysis is the second step for lignocellulosic biofuel
production. Cellulases are used for enzymatic hydrolysis of plant carbohydrate
polymers. It is a hydrolytic enzyme that degrades cellulose to glucose. Several
authors reported on enzymatic hydrolysis of different types of lignocellulosic
biomass (Nitsos et al. 2013; Bals et
al. 2014; Maitan-Alfenas et al.
2015). But major drawback on large
scale trial of enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass is the cost of
cellulase enzyme. Till now there is no viable technology which can produce cellulase
in cost effective manner. For cheaper cellulase production, high cost of medium
constituent is major limiting factor. In such case, coconut water can be used as
cheaper alternative for higher cellulase production. Major constituents of coconut
water are total sugar 32 g/L, glucose 13.5 g/L, protein 5.5 g/L, calcium 7 mmol/L,
magnesium 3.4 mmol/L, pH 5.6 (Vigliar et al. 2006; Prades et al. 2012).

Previously several authors worked on cellulase production under solid
state fermentation (SSF) in cost effective manner (Gupta et al. 2015; Kuila et al. 2015; Mangalanayaki and Madhavan 2015). Although SSF has several advantages for higher cellulase
production, but it has different drawbacks for large scale enzyme production such as
require large space for enzyme production, less amount of enzyme are extracted after
fermentation, purification of enzyme is difficult etc. In such case, submerged
fermentation (SmF) are used for production of several industrially important enzymes
(cellulase, xylanase, laccase etc.) due to its several advantages such as greater
control of environmental factors (temperature, pH), require less number of space,
higher amount of enzyme can be extracted after fermentation, purification of the
enzyme is easier.

In the present investigation, equal mixture of wheat straw and cotton
stalk (abundantly available in India) were used for optimization of thermo chemical
pretreatment (dilute acid and alkaline). After that, enzymatic hydrolysis was
carried out using pretreated biomass. Enzyme production was optimized under
submerged fermentation (SmF) using natural medium (coconut water) and waste paper.
According to our knowledge, this is the first report on cellulase production under
SmF using coconut water (highly available in India) as growth medium.

Materials and methods
Biomass
Wheat straw and cotton stalk collected from nearby locality of
Banasthali University, Rajasthan. Both the substrates were dried overnight at
70 °C. Dried substrates were milled to particle size less than 0.2 mm. After that
both the milled substrates were mixed in equal proportion and further used for
thermo chemical pretreatment.

Cellulase production
Cellulase production was carried out under submerged fermentation in
250 ml Erlenmeyer flask which contained 100 mL of sterile medium. The composition
of the medium was: coconut water and varying concentration of waste news paper. A
small spore suspension (1 × 107 spores/mL) of Aspergillus niger MS82 agar slant was added to the
100 mL sterile medium. Cellulase assay (FPase) was carried out by following
standard assay protocol (Nathan et al. 2014). The cellulase production experiment was focused on FPase
activity, produced by Aspergillus niger and
further optimized using central composite design (CCD) based response surface
methodology (RSM). The parameters and their ranges were: glucose concentration
(0.025–0.075 %, w/v), waste news paper concentration (2–8 %, w/v) and incubation
time (3–5 days). Total 20 runs were carried out for optimization study. Each
experiment was carried out in triplicates. After optimization of cellulase
production, it was further used for enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated
substrate.

Thermo chemical pretreatment of biomass
The mixture of biomass was thermo chemically pretreated using dilute
sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide. For optimization study the parameters varied
were: biomass concentration (1–10 %, w/v), sulphuric acid/sodium hydroxide
concentration (0.1–1 M) and incubation time (5–40 min). After each type of
pretreatment biomass was washed with distilled water and then dried overnight at
70 °C. After that dried biomass was subsequently used for enzymatic hydrolysis
experiments.

Biochemical composition analysis of biomass
Biochemical composition (extractives, cellulose, hemicelluloses and
lignin) of raw and optimum pretreated (sodium hydroxide pretreated) biomass were
determined by following the procedure of Yang et al. (2006). In this procedure, biomass was extracted
with acetone. The amount of extractives was measured as weight difference of the
biomass before and after extraction. To determine hemicelluloses content, the
extractive free biomass was treated with 0.5 M sodium hydroxide. The weight
difference before and after sodium hydroxide treatment was the hemicelluloses
content. To determine lignin content, extractive free biomass was treated with
sulphuric acid (98 %). The weight difference before and after sulphuric acid
treatment was the lignin content. The weight difference of the initial biomass and
total lignin, hemicelluloses and extractive content was calculated as cellulose
content of the biomass (assuming that biomass contains only cellulose,
hemicelluloses, lignin and extractives).

Enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass
Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out under following conditions:
pretreated substrate loading: 2.5 %, cellulase enzyme loading: 20 FPU/g dry
substrate, temperature: 50 °C and incubation time: 24 h. After enzymatic
hydrolysis, samples were withdrawn and centrifuges at 5000 rpm for 10 min. After
that supernatant were collected separately and measured for reducing sugar by
following miller method (Miller 1959).

Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) study
FTIR study was carried out in control and pretreated (sodium
hydroxide pretreated) biomass using KBr pellet technique. Sample spectra were
taken in the range of 600 and 4000 cm−1 with the
spectral resolution of 0.5 cm−1.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) study
FESEM (Mira 3, Tescan, field emission scanning electron microscope)
was carried out in both the control and pretreated (sodium hydroxide pretreated)
biomass. Before FESEM analysis samples were dried and coated with gold.

Thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis
TLC analysis of saccharified sample of pretreated biomass (sodium
hydroxide pretreated) was carried out using TLC plate. The mobile phage used was
ethyl acetate, isopropanol, water and pyridine (26:14:7:2). After complete run
plat was dried and sugar spots were detected with aniline diphenylamine reagent.
The sugar spots were detected against various standard sugars (glucose, xylose,
mannose, maltose, ribose and arabinose). For TLC analysis, samples were prepared
in absolute ethanol in a ratio of 3:1 and then centrifuged for the separation of
any residual protein.

From ANOVA Table it was found that the F value was 44.71 and P value
was <0.001 at 9 degree of freedom. The obtained F value was lesser than table F
value and consequent P value was very less
(less than 0.05), which showed that the RSM model adequately describe the
relationship between the response (cellulase activity) and the independent
variables. Further, the observed and adjusted regression coefficient (R
2) values were 97.58 and 95.39 %, respectively. This
demonstrated that the present model was capable of describing maximum variation in
the data.

The interactive effect of independent variables was observed using
3D response surface plot analysis. Each figure represents the effect of two
different independent variables on cellulase production while other parameters
kept constant at its optimum point. Figure 1 showed the effect of substrate concentration and incubation
time on cellulase production from Aspergillus
niger. It demonstrated by increasing substrate concentration along
with incubation time cellulase activity was increased and maximum cellulase
activity (0.53 IU/mL) was obtained using 8 % substrate concentration and after
3 days of incubation time. After 3 days of incubation time, further increase in
incubation time cellulase production was decreased significantly. Damisa et al.
(2012) reported cellulase production
under submerged fermentation using waste paper as substrate. Authors reported
maximum cellulase activity (0.18 IU/mL) after 96 h of incubation. The difference
in cellulase activity was might be due to different strain and fermentation medium
used for cellulase production. Manglanayaki and Madhavan (2015) reported maximum cellulase production
(0.76 IU/mL) using 3 % substrate concentration after 9 days of incubation.
Figure 2 demonstrated the effect of
glucose and substrate concentration on cellulase production. It showed maximum
cellulase activity was obtained using 0.07 % (w/v) glucose concentration.
Interactive effect of glucose concentration and incubation time on cellulase
production has been demonstrated in Fig. 3. It showed by increasing glucose concentration along with
incubation time cellulase activity was increased but after certain value further
increase or decrease its concentration cellulase production was decreased. From 3D
response surface plot analysis, the optimum predicted conditions for cellulase
production was: glucose concentration 0.07 % (w/v), substrate concentration 8 %
(w/v) and incubation time 3 days. Under above conditions maximum experimental
cellulase activity was found to be 0.53 IU/mL, which was very close to predicted
response (0.54 IU/mL). Kumar et al. (2011) reported maximum Aspergillus cellulase production (0.36 IU/mL) under following
conditions: substrate concentration 6.5 %, pH 4.6 and incubation time 126 h. Saini
et al. (2015) reported cellulase
production from Penicillium oxalicum under
submerged fermentation. Authors reported maximum cellulase production of 1.2 IU/mL
from after 8 days of incubation using complex growth medium. In the present
investigation, maximum cellulase production of 0.53 IU/mL was obtained within
3 days incubation time using coconut water as growth medium. For cost effective
cellulase production medium constituents and incubation time are the major
limiting factors (Gautam et al. 2011).
The present investigation can be further studied by gradual scaling up of
cellulase production for additional enhancement of enzyme production. After
optimization of cellulase production, the cellulase was used for enzymatic
hydrolysis of pretreated biomass.Fig. 1 RSM plot showing the effect of substrate concentration (%) and
incubation time (days) on cellulase production (IU/mL)

Biochemical composition of lignocellulosic biomass
Table 3 showed biochemical
composition of raw and pretreated (sodium hydroxide pretreated) biomass. It showed
that after pretreatment lignin and hemicelluloses content decreased considerably
but there was no significant effect on cellulose content. This observation was
might be due to selective degradation of lignin and hemicelluloses after alkaline
pretreatment. Similar type of observation was reported previously in case of
sodium hydroxide treated corn stover (Chen et al. 2013). For enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis, there needs low lignin
content and high cellulose content. The present result showed effectiveness of
dilute alkaline pretreatment for efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulosic
biomass.Table 3 Biochemical composition of lignocellulosic biomass

Pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass
In the present study dilute acid and alkaline pretreatment of
lignocellulosic biomass was carried out under varying conditions of substrate
concentration (1, 2, 5, 8 and 10 %), dilute acid/alkaline concentration (0.1, 0.2,
0.5, 0.8 and 1 M) and incubation time (5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 min).
Figure 4 showed the effect of different
substrate concentration on thermochemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass.
It showed maximum reducing sugar (7.03 mg/mL) was obtained in case of biomass
pretreatment with 0.2 M sodium hydroxide at 8 % substrate concentration, 20 min
incubation time and 120 °C temperature. Further increase or decrease in substrate
concentration during thermochemical pretreatment, reducing sugar yield was
decreased. Similar type of observation was reported by Hong et al. (2012) and McIntosh and Vancov (2011) in case of biomass pretreated with dilute
phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide, respectively. Figure 5 demonstrated the effect of acid/alkaline
concentration on thermochemical pretreatment of biomass. It showed maximum
reducing sugar (9.89 mg/mL) was obtained in case of biomass pretreated with 0.5 M
sodium hydroxide using 8 % substrate concentration, 20 min incubation time and
120 °C temperature. Wang et al. (2010) reported sodium hydroxide pretreatment of Bermuda grass.
Authors reported maximum reducing sugar production when the biomass was pretreated
with 0.19 M sodium hydroxide for 15 min at 121 °C. The variation in optimum sodium
hydroxide concentration was might be due to different biomass was used for
pretreatment. Effect of incubation time on thermochemical pretreatment of biomass
has been demonstrated in Fig. 6. The
maximum reducing sugar (8.9 mg/mL) was obtained when biomass was treated with
0.5 M sodium hydroxide at 8 % substrate concentration, 20 min incubation time and
120 °C temperature. Choi et al. (2013)
reported optimum sodium hydroxide pretreatment of empty fruit bunch at 3 % sodium
hydroxide concentration, 11 min 20 s incubation time and 140 °C temperature. The
above results showed that optimum thermochemical pretreatment condition was 0.5 M
sodium hydroxide concentration, 8 % substrate concentration, 20 min incubation
time and 120 °C temperature. The maximum reducing sugar yield from pretreated
biomass (under optimum conditions) was 398.0 mg/g dry biomass within 24 of
enzymatic hydrolysis. Kshirsagar et al. (2015) reported maximum reducing sugar yield (359 mg/g dry
biomass) from dilute acid pretreated rice straw after 72 h enzymatic hydrolysis.
Ioelovich and Morag (2012) reported
82 % reducing sugar yield from mild acid and alkaline pretreated biomass after
48 h of enzymatic hydrolysis. The present study showed higher reducing sugar
production from mixture of biomass (wheat straw and cotton stalk) within short
incubation time (24 h). This study has also established that the cheap substrates
could effectively be used for ethanol production through further process
optimization of simultaneous saccharification and fermentation.Fig. 4 Effect of substrate concentration (%) on thermochemical

FTIR analysis of lignocellulosic biomass
FTIR spectral characterization of raw and sodium hydroxide
pretreated lignocellulosic biomass was carried out in the region range of
600–4000 cm−1. Figure 7 showed the IR spectra of raw and pretreated biomass. The peak
around 1032 cm−1 corresponds to aromatic C–H
deformation (present in lignin), C–O deformation in primary alcohol and stretching
of non conjugated C=O bond (lignin and hemicelluloses). The band around
1693 cm−1 corresponds to un-conjugated C–O stretching
(present in lignin) and band around 2838–2911 cm−1
corresponds to C–H stretching of lignin polymer. The band around 3318 and
3815 cm−1 corresponds to O–H stretching of lignin and
hemicelluloses polymer. Table 4 summarizes
the absorbance band and corresponding functional groups present in lignocellulosic
biomass. All the band intensities were reduced after sodium hydroxide
pretreatment, indicates the degradation of lignin polymer during pretreatment. The
reduced intensity indicates cleavage of lignin side chains. The above result
highlight the effectiveness of dilute alkaline pretreatment of lignocellulosic
biomass for enzymatic hydrolysis.Fig. 7 FTIR spectra of lignocellulosic biomass (raw and
pretreated)

SEM analysis of lignocellulosic biomass
Figure 8 showed the SEM
picture of raw and pretreated (sodium hydroxide pretreated lignocellulosic
biomass. It showed after pretreatment the cell wall structure of lignocellulosic
biomass was degraded. This finding demonstrated that degradation of lignin and
hemicelluloses during pretreatment cause distortion of cell wall structure of
lignocellulosic biomass. Similar types of observation were reported earlier (Cui
et al. 2012; Wei et al. 2015). The SEM analysis demonstrated the
effectiveness of dilute alkaline pretreatment for efficient saccharification of
lignocellulosic biomass.Fig. 8 SEM image of lignocellulosic biomass (raw and
pretreated)




TLC analysis of sugars present in saccharified sample of pretreated
biomass
Sugars present in the saccharified sample were analyzed by
calculating their R

The result suggested the presence of different sugars (glucose, xylose, mannose,
maltose) in the saccharified sample.Table 5 Rf values of sugars present in

under submerged fermentation using natural medium and waste paper. Maximum cellulase
production (0.53 IU/mL) was obtained within 3 days of incubation time. The produced
cellulase was applied for hydrolysis of dilute acid and alkaline pretreated biomass.
It showed maximum reducing sugar yield of 398.0 mg/g dry biomass was obtained from
dilute alkaline pretreated biomass (under sodium hydroxide concentration of 0.5 M,
substrate concentration of 8 %, temperature of 120 °C and incubation time of
20 min). Further effectiveness of dilute alkaline pretreatment was analyzed through
