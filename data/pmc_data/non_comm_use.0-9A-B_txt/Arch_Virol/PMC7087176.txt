In December 2004, three influenza H1N2 viruses were isolated from lung samples of pigs that had died from respiratory disease on a farm in southeastern China. To determine the genetic characterization and probable origin, one of the three isolates, A/Swine/Zhejiang/1/2004 (Sw/ZJ/1/2004), was genetically analyzed. Sw/ZJ/1/2004 was a reassortant with an NA gene most closely related to the corresponding gene from a human-like H3N2 virus circulating in 1995. The remaining seven genes were most closely related to those from the classical swine H1N1 virus. Sw/ZJ/1/2004 appeared to be a novel reassortant H1N2 virus that was genetically distinguishable from other H1N2 viruses found in pigs worldwide. The isolation of Sw/ZJ/1/2004 provided further evidence for pigs serving as a “mixing vessel” for the generation of new reassortant genotypes of influenza viruses and emphasizes the importance of reinforcing influenza virus surveillance in pigs in China.
