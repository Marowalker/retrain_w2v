Following oral inoculation, the excretion of a virulent or an attenuated strain of bovine coronavirus in calf feces and their persistence in spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were studied using hemagglutination and direct fluorescent antibody tests, respectively. The virus was excreted in feces for only 3 days at high titers and then intermittently at low titers. However, viral antigen was detected in crypt or Peyer's patches for at least 3 weeks after infection in 1 of 3 calves given virulent virus and 1 of 2 calves given attenuated virus.
