In the original publication of this article, a new species of torradovirus was named Tomato chocolate spot virus, and the acronym ToCSV was proposed for this virus. However, this acronym has been approved by the ICTV for the begomovirus, Tomato curly stunt virus. Hence, it has been agreed that the acronym ToChSV will be used for the new torradovirus, Tomato chocolate spot virus.
