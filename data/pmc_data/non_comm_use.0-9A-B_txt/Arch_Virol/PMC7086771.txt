Baby rabbits surviving infection with pleural effusion disease virus (PEDV) developed viraemia persisting for at least six months. Only the infectious serum samples collected during the first 2 months of disease could transfer the typical PED. Six months after neonatal infection, virus concentration in serum was 102 to 104 rabbit-infectious doses per ml, the level of IgG appeared elevated, and serum rendered non-infectious by ether-treatment had a protective effect in passive immunisation experiments.

No evidence of glomerulonephritis or deposits of immunoglobulins could be demonstrated in the kidneys.

During the nursing period PEDV was transmitted from infected baby rabbits to two out of four dams, but not to control litter-mates. After the nursing period control rabbits, caged together with the viraemic rabbits for 60 to 150 days, remained free from PEDV infection.
