The nucleocapsids purified from peanut plants systemically infected with peanut bud necrosis virus (PBNV), a member of the genus Tospovirus, contained both viral(v) and viral complementary(vc) sense L RNAs. Defective forms of L RNA containing ‘core polymerase region’ were observed. The full length L RNA of PBNV was sequenced using overlapping cDNA clones. The 8911 nucleotide L RNA contains a single open reading frame (ORF) in the vc strand, and encodes a protein of 330 kDa. At the 5′ and 3′ termini of the v sense RNA there were 247 and 32 nt untranslated regions, respectively, containing an 18 nt complementary sequence with one mismatch. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence of the L protein of PBNV with other members of Bunyaviridae suggest that the L protein of PBNV is a viral polymerase. The L protein had highest identity in the ‘core-polymerase domain’ with the corresponding regions of other tospoviruses, tomato spotted wilt virus and impatiens necrotic spot virus.
