Genetic heterogeneous mouse populations selected for high (HIII) and low (LIII) antibody response were used to study some aspects of mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) infection, such as the resistance pattern, virus replication in the liver and peritoneal exudate or in cultured peritoneal macrophages, the interferon (IFN) synthesis in the serum and peritoneal exudate and the procoagulant activity (PCA) of the peritoneal exudate (PEC) and spleen cells (SC). The HIII mice, when compared to their LIII mice counterparts, were susceptible to MHV3 infection showing higher virus titres in the liver and peritoneal exudate, comparable IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma titres in the peritoneal exudate or in the serum, and higher levels of PCA of PEC and SC. A higher virus titre was detected in the supernatants of HIII mouse macrophages infected with MHV3. The activation of HIII mouse macrophages with LPS, IFN alpha/beta or IFN gamma, in contrast to that of LIII mouse macrophages, did not induce an antiviral effect with partial restriction of the MHV3 replication. The LPS antiviral activity was shown to be partially exerted by IFN alpha/beta synthesis. The IFN gamma was shown to be more effective in inducing an antiviral state in LIII macrophages, when compared to IFN alpha/beta. The data obtained are consistent with the notion that the resistance mechanisms to the MHV3 infection involve the PCA and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN.
