Different tree-building methods consistently place the SARS corona-virus (SARS-CoV) as a basal Group 2 coronavirus rather than as an ungrouped species as concluded by others. Detailed comparisons of the SARS-CoV genomic sequence with those of six other coronaviruses failed to find evidence of recombination or genomic rearrangement using computational methods designed for that purpose.
