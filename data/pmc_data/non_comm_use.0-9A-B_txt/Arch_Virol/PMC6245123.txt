Correction to: Arch Virol (2017) 162:201–211 10.1007/s00705-016-3093-3
The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake in the “Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)” section of “Materials and methods” third paragraph. The corrected paragraph is updated here.

The levels of IL-6, TNF-a and IL-1b, and trypsin were measured using ELISA kits (R&D Systems for the cytokines and MyBioSource for trypsin) according to the respective protocol provided by the manufacturer.
