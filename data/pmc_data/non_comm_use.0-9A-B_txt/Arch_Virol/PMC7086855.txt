This study investigated the abilities of cDNA probes from the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome of human rhinoviruses (HRV-) 14, 9, and 1B to detect RNA from 59 rhinovirus serotypes. The results show that probes from the 5′ end of the genomes of HRV-14, 9, and 1B detected a large number of serotypes but the detection rate was variable and depended on the degree of homology with the particular probe. In contrast, all the 3′ end probes were specific for the homologous virus. However, along HRV-9 probe detected a large number of serotypes.

It was concluded that such cDNA probes would not detect all serotypes with equal efficiency. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to short but highly conserved regions in the 5′ non coding region may overcome this problem.
