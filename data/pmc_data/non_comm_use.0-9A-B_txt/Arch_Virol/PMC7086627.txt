Introduction
In accordance with the Statutes of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the final stage in the process of making changes to the Universal Scheme of Virus Classification is the ratification of taxonomic proposals by ICTV members. This can occur either at a plenary meeting of ICTV, held during an International Congress of Virology meeting, or by circulation of proposals by mail, followed by a ballot. Therefore, a list of proposals that had been subjected to the full, multi-stage review process was prepared and presented on the ICTVonline web pages in March 2008. This review process involved input from the ICTV study groups and subcommittees, other interested virologists, and the ICTV Executive Committee. For the first time, the ratification process was performed entirely by email. The proposals were sent electronically via email on 18 March 2008, to ICTV Life Members (11), ICTV Subcommittee Members (74), and ICTV National Representatives (53). Members were then requested to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals, within a 1-month deadline.

International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses attempts to keep an up-to-date list of all members, including National Representatives, but this is a daunting task. As a means of promoting contact between ICTV and its National Members and to ensure that lists of members are up to date, member societies of IUMS are obliged to either renew ICTV National Members or replace them every three years. In effect, National Members have a 3-year tenure that can be renewed indefinitely. National Societies, which are members of the International Union of Microbiological Societies, are encouraged to contact ICTV directly through the ICTV Secretary with the names of their National Representatives. Complete contact information can be obtained from the ICTV web site: http://ictvonline.org.

The following are the taxonomic proposals that were ratified by ICTV members in April 2008.

ICTV life memberships
The ICTV Executive Committee unanimously nominates the following eminent virologists and long-term secretaries of the ICTV to Life Membership of the ICTV:Dr. Claude Fauquet

Dr. Michael Mayo




Note: Dr. M. Mayo died December 2008.

Conclusion
As a result of the vote, all of the above taxonomic proposals were approved by the membership. They are now a part of the official ICTV taxonomy. A list of the approved taxa can be found on the ICTV online web site. The most recent report of ICTV was published in 2005 [1]. ICTV is currently updating this information and expects to publish its 9th Report in 2010.
