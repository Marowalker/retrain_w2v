Transmissible gastroenteritis virus grown in primary swine kidney cell cultures agglutinated erythrocytes from chicken, guinea pig and cattle but not erythrocytes from mouse and goose. The optimal incubation temperature was at 4°C. The hemagglutination (HA) reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in the HA and HA-inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were established. HI antibody titers of individual pig sera showed a significant positive correlation with their neutralizing antibody titers.
