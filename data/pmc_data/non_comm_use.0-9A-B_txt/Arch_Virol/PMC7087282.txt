Egg grown avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) centrifuged on sucrose density gradients was found to consist of a major virus peak of density 1.17 to 1.18 g/cm3 and occasionally two minor virus peaks of density 1.21 to 1.22 g/cm3 and 1.13 g/cm3. Three different IBV strains were examined and no morphological differences were detected between virus particles of different densities or from different strains. The polypeptides of the different density virus particles from the three IBV strains were analysed on polyacrylamide gels. In all cases 7 polypeptides were observed, although there were differences in the proportions of these polypeptides in particles of different densities and those from the different strains. The polypeptides have been called VP1 (molecular weight 130,000), VP2 (105,000), VP3 (97,000), VP4 (81,000), VP5 (74,000), VP6 (51,000) and VP7 (33,000). Additional polypeptides were produced if slightly harsher treatments were used.
