The complete nucleotide sequence of Pelargonium line pattern virus (PLPV) has been determined. The PLPV genomic RNA comprises 3884 nt and contains six open reading frames (ORFs) potentially encoding proteins of 27 (p27), 13 (p13), 87 (p87), 7 (p7), 6 (p6), and 37 kDa (p37), respectively. The arrangement of these ORFs on the PLPV genome closely resembles that of members of the genus Carmovirus in the family Tombusviridae and, moreover, most of the putative PLPV gene products showed high identity with proteins of this viral group. However, several striking differences were noticed. Carmoviruses generate two subgenomic RNAs whereas PLPV produces a single one. In addition, only p7 showed similarity with movement proteins of carmoviruses whereas p6 (as p13) has no viral (or other) homologs. This protein might be expressed from a non-canonical start codon or, alternatively, through a −1 frameshift (FS) mechanism. Both, the production of one subgenomic RNA and the likely involvement of a −1 FS for expression of an internal ORF parallel the translation strategies reported for the unique species of the genus Panicovirus, belonging also to the family Tombusviridae. Overall, the results support the placement of PLPV in this family although its peculiar characteristics preclude its direct assignment to any of the current genera.
