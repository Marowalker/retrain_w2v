 In this study feline (FECV and FIPV) and canine (CCoV) coronavirus entry into and release from polarized porcine epithelial LLC-PK1 cells, stably expressing the recombinant feline aminopeptidase-N cDNA, were investigated. Virus entry appeared to occur preferentially through the apical membrane, similar to the entry of the related porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) into these cells. However, whereas TGEV is released apically, feline and canine coronaviruses were found to be released from the basolateral side of the epithelial cells. These observations indicate that local infections as caused by TGEV, FECV and CCoV do not strictly correlate with apical release, as suggested by earlier work.
