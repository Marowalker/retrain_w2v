Parker's rat coronavirus (PRC) is a naturally-occurring viral infection of the laboratory rat. On the first passage, ATCC strain 8190 of PRC replicated in L-2 cells. Using the tenth passage of PRC in L-2 cells, the characteristics of the virus were compared with previous studies of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) replicated in L-2 cells. Based on light and immunofluorescence microscopic examination of control and inoculated cell cultures, PRC-associated CPE was frequently confined primarily to individual cells, and there were relatively few syncytial giant cells. Maximum titers were recovered at 36h post inoculation (pi). Infectious virus was demonstrated at pH values ranging from 6.0 to 9.0 and a pH of 7.5 was determined to produce the highest titers of PRC. The optimum temperature for viral replication was 33°C. Up to 15 passages of PRC in L-929 cells failed to produce detectable virus. However, after adaptation in L-2 cells (20th passage), PRC replicated to high titers in L-929 cells. Previously, in vitro studies of rat coronaviruses have been hampered by the lack of an identified continuous cell line to replicate these viruses in the laboratory. L-2 cells represent a readily-available continuous cell line that can support the replication of relatively high titers of PRC.
