The effects of incorporating diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) in the inoculum with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) on the infectivity of BRSV was evaluated. A concentration of 40 µg DEAE-D/ml provided maximal enhancement of infection as determined by the time of onset of cytopathic effect (CPE), the percentage of cells infected by the inoculum, and the amount of virus produced. When DEAE-D was used in the inoculum, the CPE appeared a day earlier, the percentage of cells infected by the inoculum, as determined by the fluorescent antibody test, was increased 11 times, and the viral titer was increased 2 times as compared to results obtained without DEAE-D. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus-infected cultures contained much cell-associated virus which could be liberated by sonication to increase the titer of virus stocks. The use of BRSV-infected cells rather than supernates from BRSV-infected cells increased the rate at which a cytopathic effect developed, although it did not substantially increase the titer of virus which was harvested. The use of DEAE-D in the inoculum and the passage of BRSV-infected cells instead of viral suspensions was found to be the quickest and most effective method of consistently obtaining BRSV with a titer of about 105.5 TCID50/ml.
