Mouse hepatitis virus strain 3 replicated in C57, A/Sn and A/J strain mouse macrophages with the production of a clear cytopathic effect, although only C57 and A/Sn strains of mice were killed with similar MHV3 dilutions. We could not confirm a previous report showing thatin vitro cultured macrophages from A/J strain mice were resistant to MHV3 infection.
