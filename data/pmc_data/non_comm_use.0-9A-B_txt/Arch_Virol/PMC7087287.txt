The replication of four porcine parvovirus isolates, NADL-8, NADL-2, KBSH, and Kresse, in swine testes cells were compared at temperatures of 32, 37, and 39 °C. Replication of the Kresse isolate was restricted at 32 and 37 °C as evidenced by progeny virus, virus polypeptide and viral DNA synthesis, but not at 39 °C. In contrast, replication of KBSH was restricted at 39 °C, but not at 37 or 32 °C. Findings from this study support the contention that replication of KBSH and Kresse isolates are temperature dependent.
