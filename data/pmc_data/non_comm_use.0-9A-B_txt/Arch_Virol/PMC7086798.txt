 We report here a 5596 nt sequence comprising the 3′-end of the (+) ssRNA genome of gill-associated virus (GAV), an invertebrate nidovirus of Penaeus monodon prawns. The sequence extends from a subgenomic RNA start site 35 nt upstream of the 4923 nt ORF3 gene to a 3′-poly(A) tail of the 26235 nt genome of GAV. The putative 1640 amino acid (aa) ORF3 protein (MW = 182049 Da, pI = 6.62) contains 15 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, 15 potential O-linked glycosylation sites and six highly hydrophobic regions predicted to represent transmembrane (TM) domains. Three of the predicted TM domains occur in the amino-terminal 228 aa, two in the central portion, and one near the carboxy-terminus of ORF3. Only one short (83 aa) open reading frame (ORF4) was identified between ORF3 and the 3′-poly(A) tail. Completion of the genome sequence of GAV has revealed a gene organisation unique among nidoviruses in there is no discrete membrane protein gene and that the putative ORF3 spike glycoprotein gene resides downstream of a gene (ORF2) encoding a structural protein associated with nucleocapsids.
