Monensin, at concentrations which depended on the multiplicity of infection, was found to prevent DNA replication of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) as well as production of viral progeny in human foreskin fibroblasts. The drug did not affect DNA replication of herpes simplex virus. Inhibition of consecutive HCMV DNA synthesis was also observed following delayed addition of the drug within 12–24 hours postinfection, but was fully reversible upon its removal. Viral replication proceeded, however, without impairment in cultures treated with monensin prior to infection. Induction of viral DNA polymerase activity was not impeded by the inhibitor. Analysis of protein- and glycoprotein synthesis revealed that monensin interfered with the production of a number of HCMV-specific polypeptides. Furthermore, evidence was obtained that the drug may hinder intracellular transport of a 135 kd glycopolypeptide.
