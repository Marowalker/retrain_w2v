We previously reported the expression of soluble A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) hemagglutinin in insect cells and the molecular and immunological structure of an aggregated fraction, only observed in cell supernatant when expression was performed at low pH [23]. Here we report that besides this aggregated a monomeric and possibly a trimeric structure is detected in cell supernatant, irrespective of the pH of the medium. Evidence is presented that the aggregated fraction is generated out of monomeric HA0s molecules due to a low intracellular pH encountered during secretion.
