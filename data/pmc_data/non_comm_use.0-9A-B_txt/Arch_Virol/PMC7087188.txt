Unfortunately, the concentration unit of plasmids was published incorrectly in the original publication of the article. The concentration unit, ‘copies/ml’ should be corrected to ‘copies/μl’. This changes do not affect to the analytic sensitivity of the method because the detection limits of 50–100 copies/μL and 5–100 copies/μL using pUC57-SARS-pS2 (a template for SARS-CoV) and pGEM-MERS-S2 (a template for MERS-CoV), respectively, were as sensitive as other real-time PCR methods [1].
