Thirteen monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to the glycoprotein (G) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotype Indiana were prepared and examined for their effects on various biological activities of VSV, including in vitro infection, hemagglutination, adsorption to cells, and mediation of cell fusion. Competitive binding assays with these MAbs revealed the presence of at least seven distinct antigenic determinants (epitopes) on the G protein. In some cases, overlappings among epitopes to various degrees were observed as partial inhibition or binding enhancement. The MAbs to all the epitopes but one (epitopes 1–6) reacted with the denatured G protein in a Western immunoblot analysis. Four of the epitopes (epitopes 2, 4, 5, and 7) were involved in neutralization and two (epitopes 1 and 2) in hemagglutination inhibition. None of the MAbs inhibited the adsorption of radiolabeled VSV to BHK-21 cells; the MAbs to epitope 2 slightly enhanced the virus adsorption. All neutralization epitopes except epitope 2 (epitopes 4, 5, and 7) were associated with inhibition of VSV-mediated cell fusion. These results show a direct spatial relationship between the epitopes recognized by the MAbs and functional sites on G protein and further insights into the structure and function of G protein.
