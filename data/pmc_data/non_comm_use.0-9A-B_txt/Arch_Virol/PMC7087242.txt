Hemagglutinating and acetylesterase functions as well as the 124 kDa glycoprotein were present in the highly cell-culture adapted, avirulent bovine coronavirus strain BCV-L9, in the Norden vaccine strain derived from it, and in 5 wild-type, virulent strains that multiplied in HRT-18 cells but were restricted in several types of cultured bovine cells. The BCV-L9 and the wild-type strain BCV-LY-138 agglutinated chicken and mouse erythrocytes. The acetylesterase facilitated break-down of the BCV-erythrocyte complex with chicken but only to a minimal extent with mouse erythrocytes in the receptor-destroying enzyme test. Purified preparations of the vaccine and the wild-type strains agglutinated chicken erythrocytes at low titers and mouse erythrocytes at 128 to 256 times higher titers whereas receptor destroying enzyme activity was detectable only with chicken erythrocytes. When wild-type strains were propagated in HRT cells at low passage levels, they produced 5×105 to 4.5×106 plaque forming units per 50 µl which agglutinated erythrocytes from mice but not from chickens. Diisopropylfluoro-phosphate moderately increased the hemagglutination titers, but completely inhibited the receptor destroying enzyme of purified virus of all strains. It had virtually no influence on the plaque-forming infectivity of the different BCV strains. The acetylesterase of strain BCV-L9 reacting in the receptor-destroying enzyme test was stable for 3h at 37 and 42°C. It was inactivated within 30 min at 56°C while the hemagglutinin function of this strain was stable for 3 h at 37, 42, and 56°C, but it was inactivated at 65°C within 1 h.
