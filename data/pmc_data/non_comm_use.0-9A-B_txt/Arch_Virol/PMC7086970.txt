Eighteen mouse ascitic fluids containing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against crystallized hexon of adenovirus (AV) type I were used to map the antigenic structure of the capsomer in reciprocal competitive binding ELISA. With the help of peroxidase-labelled MAbs at least nine epitopes (epitope clusters) located on three distinct antigenic sites were identified on the hexon. Epitope on antigenic site I recognized by two MAbs could be the genus specific antigenic determinant based on the broad reactivity patterns of the MAbs. Epitopes on the antigenic site II recognized by fifteen MAbs could be divided into seven epitope clusters according to the competition patterns. Antigenic site III recognized by one MAb completely differs from the antigenic site I and on the basis of one-way blocking with all the MAbs specific for antigenic site II, should be also different from the latter one. The data suggest that the seven epitope clusters of antigenic site II contain partially overlapping epitopes and may be a part of a large single immunodominant antigenic region on AV1 hexon as well as on hexons of heterologous types.
