 The genetic variability of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragments among 50 Korean isolates from open reading frame 5. All Korean PRRSVs were isolated from the field cases after the marketing of an U.S. ATCC VR2332-derived modified live PRRSV vaccine. Combining the restriction enzyme digestion patterns obtained with MluI, HincII, SacII, and HaeIII, we observed 19 distinct RFLP patterns. Seventeen out of 50 PRRSV isolates (34%) exhibited the modified live PRRSV vaccine RFLP pattern. The genomic variations that have been identified in the present study seemed to represent characteristic features of the Korean PRRSV isolates. PCR-based RFLP analysis using several restriction enzymes provides a good genetic estimate for isolate differentiation.
