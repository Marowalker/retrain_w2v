The bioenergy grass Miscanthus is native to eastern Asia. As
Miscanthus uses C4 photosynthesis, the
cooler temperatures experienced in much of northern Europe are expected to
limit productivity. Identification of genetic diversity in chilling
tolerance will enable breeders to generate more productive varieties for
these cooler regions. Characterizing the temporal relationships between
photosynthesis, carbohydrate and molecular expression of relevant genes is
key to understanding genotypic differences in tolerance or sensitivity.

Methods
To characterize chilling responses in four Miscanthus
genotypes, plants were exposed to a sudden reduction in temperature. The
genotypes studied comprised of two M. sinensis, one
M. sacchariflorus and one inter-species hybrid,
M. × giganteus. Changes in
photosynthesis (Asat), carbohydrate composition
and the expression of target transcripts were observed following
chilling-shock. After 4 d the decline in leaf elongation rate (LER) in the
different genotypes was measured.

Results
Following chilling-shock the greatest decline in
Asat was observed in M.
sacchariflorus and one M. sinensis genotype.
Carbohydrate concentrations increased in all genotypes following chilling
but to a lesser extent in M. sacchariflorus. Two stress
inducible genes were most highly expressed in the genotypes that experienced
the greatest declines in Asat and LER.
Miscanthus × giganteus retained
the highest Asat and was unique in exhibiting no
decline in LER following transfer to 12 °C.

Conclusions
Miscanthus × giganteus exhibits a
superior tolerance to chilling shock than other genotypes of
Miscanthus. The absence of sucrose accumulation in
M. sacchariflorus during chilling-shock suggests an
impairment in enzyme function. A candidate transcription factor,
MsCBF3, is most highly expressed in the most sensitive
genotypes and may be a suitable molecular marker for predicting chilling
sensitivity.

INTRODUCTION
The search for a sustainable substitute for fossil fuels has stimulated research into
bioenergy crops. The criteria for such crops include low-input requirements, rapid
accumulation of biomass and high yield. Perenniality is also advantageous, both
economically and environmentally, as financial costs are saved on annual re-planting
and tilling and environmentally by the sequestration of carbon in the soil (Clifton-Brown et al.,
2007). As a C4 perennial rhizomatous grass with a high annual
yield and low-input requirements (Lewandowski
et al., 2000), Miscanthus fulfils
these criteria. As a C4 plant Miscanthus exhibits high
radiation, water- and nitrogen-use efficiencies (Lewandowski et al., 2000). The penalty
of C4 photosynthesis, however, is a higher thermal requirement to
initiate growth in the spring which imposes a limitation on growing range (Long, 1983; Naidu et al., 2003). Currently all
commercial plantations of Miscanthus, and indeed a large amount of
the research, have focussed on a single genotype M. ×
giganteus. This genotype is a sterile triploid progeny of a
cross between M. sinensis and M. sacchariflorus;
it is high yielding, reportedly producing over 20 t dry matter
ha−1 year−1 in Europe (Lewandowski et al., 2000) and over 30 t
dry matter ha−1 year−1 in the mid-western USA
(Dohleman and Long, 2009). An
unusual characteristic of M. × giganteus is
its ability to maintain high rates of light-saturated photosynthesis under chilling
conditions inhibitory to other C4 crops such as Zea mays
(maize; Naidu et al.,
2003). However, it has shown poor overwinter survival rates in northern
locations (Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski,
2000) and, owing to its sterility, M. ×
giganteus can only be vegetatively propagated from rhizome
pieces, resulting in high establishment costs. A major plant breeding target is to
develop a seed-based crop that can equal or outperform M. ×
giganteus.

The geographical range for Miscanthus spans from the sub-tropics to
the sub-arctic (Numata, 1974; Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000).
Correspondingly, variation in cold tolerance has been observed in different
genotypes (Clifton-Brown and Jones,
1997; Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski,
2000; Farrell et
al., 2006; Yan
et al., 2012). Cold tolerance may refer to the
ability of a rhizome to survive winter conditions (Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000; Yan et al., 2012), late spring frosts
(Farrell et al.,
2006), seedling survival (Yan
et al., 2012), the continuation of leaf expansion in
progressively colder temperatures (Clifton-Brown and Jones, 1997) or the ability to retain high rates of
photosynthesis under cool conditions (Wang
et al., 2008a). In spring when the
canopy is still developing the daily temperature fluctuations in northern European
locations are typically near freezing at night and up to 30 °C on a clear
day. Temperatures may vary greatly between days but also within the daylight period
of individual days. For example, in the coastal region of West Wales, temperatures
in the daylight period on 22 May 2010 were recorded to decrease 14 °C between
the warmest time of day (28 °C, at approximately noon) and sunset
(approximately 2100 h; Supplementary Data Table S1). Sub-optimal temperatures during the
light period depress photosynthetic performance of maize, and complete recovery may
take several days even after a return to favourable temperatures (Andrews et al., 1995).
Whether all Miscanthus genotypes are equally susceptible to the
same limitations remains to be determined. For the production of
Miscanthus in the cooler climates of northern Europe and parts
of North America all of these aspects will have to be considered to generate high
yielding varieties. Miscanthus sinensis has been reported to have
greater tolerance to cold, in terms of overwinter survival, compared with
M. × giganteus (Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000). However,
M × giganteus has been shown to retain
high levels of photosynthesis compared with other C4 grasses under cool
conditions (Naidu et al.,
2003; Wang et al.,
2008a; Dohleman and Long, 2009; Dohleman
et al., 2009), although how this compares with other
Miscanthus genotypes is yet to be reported.

Miscanthus is a bioenergy crop harvested for the structural
carbohydrates in the cell wall. Carbohydrates assimilated through photosynthesis may
be directly respired, converted into structural forms (cellulose and
hemi-cellulose), maintained in soluble form or converted into the transient storage
form, starch. Carbohydrate partitioning refers to the division of carbohydrates
between these pools. To date there have been no studies that address the
non-structural carbohydrate status of the above-ground material in either optimal or
short-term chilling conditions in Miscanthus. The changes in
carbohydrate status that occur in response to chilling have been documented in a
number of other species including maize (Hodges et al., 1997), Saccharum sp.
(sugarcane) (Du and Nose, 2002),
Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) (Stitt and Hurry, 2002) and Helianthus
annuus (sunflower) (Paul
et al., 1991). The changes in the non-structural
carbohydrate pools can be indicative of chilling tolerance or susceptibility. For
example, chilling tolerant varieties of sugarcane accumulated soluble sugar in
response to chilling, whereas a sensitive variety did not (Du and Nose, 2002). In maize the opposite response was
observed (Hodges et al.,
1997). In a chilling-tolerant plant such as arabidopsis, chilling-shock
leads to a shift in carbohydrate partitioning away from starch and into soluble
sugars (Kaplan et al.,
2004). The breakdown of starch during chilling leads to an increase in
soluble sugars, such as maltose, which have protective properties during temperature
stress (Kaplan et al.,
2004). Whether this adaptive response also occurs in
Miscanthus remains to be determined.

Upon exposure to chilling temperatures, large transcriptional changes have been
documented to take place in a number of species including Vitis
vinifera (grapevine) (Tattersall
et al., 2007), arabidopsis (Provart et al., 2003; Hannah et al., 2006;
Kaplan et al.,
2007), maize (Trzcinska-Danielewicz
et al., 2009) and sugarcane (Nogueira et al., 2003). Transcriptional
changes that take place during chilling in Miscanthus are yet to be
studied. The identification of DNA-based markers of chilling tolerance (or
susceptibility) would facilitate the screening of seedlings or potential parents to
accelerate the breeding of new varieties better adapted to more northerly
locations.

In temperate climates such as northern Europe and the mid-western USA, short-term
temperature deviations from favourable temperatures to chilling are problematic for
thermophilic C4 crops (Andrews
et al., 1995; Allen and Ort, 2001). Studies in other species, including maize,
arabidopsis, Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Hordeum
vulgare (barley), have successfully used chilling-shock experiments to
identify cold-inducible transcripts and transcription factors (Cattivelli and Bartels, 1989; Liu et al., 1998; Medina et al., 1999; Shen et al., 2003; Nguyen et al., 2009),
metabolic responses to chilling (Kaplan
et al., 2004) and cold-signalling molecules (Knight et al., 1996).
Therefore, to investigate chilling-shock responses, we performed an extreme version
of the cooling experienced on 22 May 2010 in West Wales (Table S1) by exposing
plants to a rapid reduction in temperatures from 28 °C to 12 °C.

We conducted a twin-time course in which plants were measured over 12 h at optimal
growing conditions and then over the same time period after an abrupt shift to
chilling conditions. On 22 May 2010, the daily maximum temperature reached 28
°C at the field site in West Wales (Table S1). All genotypes used in this
study are capable of flowering under a constant temperature of 28 °C (C.
Hayes, pers. comm., Aberystwyth University, UK), probably because this is a
temperature regime representative of their native environment in Japan. The
M. sacchariflorus genotype used in this study has never been
reported to flower under field conditions in West Wales. We therefore concluded that
28 °C was representative of both a northern European high temperature and
also an optimal (non-restrictive) temperature for growth of all genotypes tested. To
select a chilling regime we used the results of previous studies as a basis: Allen and Ort (2001) describe chilling
conditions in C4 crops to be 0–12 °C and in a study into
chilling tolerance in M. × giganteus, Naidu et al. (2003) used
a chilling treatment of 14/11 °C. We therefore chose a compromise between
these two reports of 12 °C to impose chilling. We characterized the changes
in photosynthesis, soluble sugars and starch following chilling-shock and then, to
investigate the molecular response to chilling, we conducted qRT-PCR on target
transcripts. Amongst the plethora of genes documented to be affected by chilling in
other species we focussed on the expression of genes involved in carbohydrate
metabolism, cold signal transduction and stress responses. The genome of
Miscanthus has not yet been sequenced so we preferentially
selected genes for study that had been annotated in maize or sorghum genome
databases. Finally, we measured changes in leaf-extension rates in plants subjected
to chilling treatments compared with control plants maintained at 28 °C.

The aim of our experiments was 3-fold: (1) to characterize photosynthesis and
carbohydrate dynamics throughout the light period in different genotypes of
Miscanthus; (2) to measure changes in photosynthesis,
carbohydrates and gene expression during chilling-shock; and (3) to identify
suitable measurements or markers that could, in future, be used to screen
prospective parent plants or crosses for chilling-shock tolerance/sensitivity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant material
All genotypes used in this study are of Japanese origin. A summary of
geographical origin, ploidy and phenotypic attributes for each genotype are
provided in Table 1.
Miscanthus sinensis (EMI-11) is a diploid clone selected in
1988 from temperate Japan (Honshu Island) by Danish plant collector Dr Poul Erik
Brander. It was part of the European Miscanthus Improvement
(EMI) programme (1997–2000) and is the female parent of the Mx2 mapping
family (Ma et al.,
2012). Miscanthus sinensis (Goliath) is an
intraspecific hybrid of M. sinensis. It is a triploid,
originally selected as a vigorous seedling from a cross (parents unknown) by
Ernst Pagels and marketed as a ‘large-type’ horticultural variety
since the 1970s. Miscanthus sacchariflorus (Sac-5) is a
tetraploid that was part of a seed population collected from central Japan by
TINPLANT in 1992. It was also part of the EMI programme.
Miscanthus × giganteus (Gig-311) is
a naturally occurring hybrid of diploid M. sinensis and a
tetraploid M. sacchariflorus. It was supplied to IBERS from
Bical (Taunton) in 2005. Table 1. Description and phenotypes of the four genotypes used in this
study

Measurements of height and stem number are the average of eight
plants per genotype from rhizome-propagated plants (±
s.e.). Different letters show significant differences between
genotypes (Student's two-tailed t-test,
P < 0·05).



Growth conditions and treatments
Plants were propagated from rhizome pieces cut from field-grown mature plants in
December 2010. Rhizome pieces were grown in a polytunnel under natural lighting
in 1-L pots in moist compost placed on capillary matting to ensure constant
water availability. When emerged stems had reached four to seven mature (ligule)
leaves on the tallest stem they were transferred to a growth room (Sanyo
Fitotron) set at a constant (day and night) temperature of 28 °C on a 12
h light : 12 h dark diurnal cycle with a light intensity of 500 µmol
m−2 s−1 photosynthetic photon flux
density (PPFD) for 10 d. Relative humidity was set at 84 % at 28
°C and 57 % at 12 °C to maintain a vapour pressure deficit
of 0·6 kPa in both rooms. Plants were randomly arranged in trays
containing six plants. Each tray contained a layer of capillary matting to
ensure a constant availability of water. Plants were watered every 3 d during
which time the plants were re-randomized within trays and the trays
re-randomized within the growth room. After 10 d the time course experiment
commenced. On day 1, plants were harvested at 0 h (lights on), 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 10
h and 12 h (lights out). On day 2, 2 h after the lights came on half the plants
were rapidly transferred to an identical controlled-environment room, with
identical lighting settings but at a temperature of a constant 12 °C (day
and night). Harvests at 12 °C were carried out at 4 h (2 h after
transfer), 6 h (4 h after transfer), 10 h (8 h after transfer) and 12 h (10 h
after transfer). A total of 33 plants per genotype were used in the experiments.
Conditions in both rooms were monitored by in-built PC-based monitoring systems
(SpecView Corp. and SpecView Ltd) and independent data loggers within the growth
rooms monitored temperature and humidity (Rotronic International) and
photosynthetically active radiation (Skye, Llandrindod Wells, UK).

Photosynthesis measurements
Leaf light-saturated CO2 assimilation rates
(Asat) were measured in vivo
using a portable open-path gas exchange system incorporating infrared
CO2 and water vapour analysers (Walz GFS-3000, Walz Gmbh,
Germany) incorporating a red–blue LED light source (Walz 3055-FL).
Reference [CO2] in the cuvette was set at 385 µmol
mol−1, the leaf temperature was maintained at the
experimental temperature (12 °C or 28 °C), and vapour pressure
deficit maintained between 1·1 and 2 kPa for all of the measurements
(Long and Bernacchi, 2003).
Three plants per genotype were randomly selected at the start of the experiment
and measured at each time-point. Measurements were made on the youngest fully
expanded leaf with a fully formed ligule and taken on the same area of the leaf,
one-third of the leaf length from the leaf tip.

For each of the genotypes studied, a preliminary assessment of the response of
photosynthesis to light was made on a small number of replicates to identify the
PPFD required to reach Asat. Plots of
A vs. Q were measured starting at PPFD
2000 µmol m−2 s−1 and decreasing
stepwise to complete darkness; curves consisted of a minimum of ten measurements
of Q. Completed A vs. Q
curves were fitted to a non-rectangular empirical function to estimate
Asat, which was consistently attained at a PPFD
of 1500 µmol m−2 s−1 (Bernacchi et al.,
2003).

For the measurement of Asat the leaf was placed in
the gas analyser leaf chamber with the PPFD set at ambient irradiance; all other
chamber parameters were as described above. The PPFD was then increased stepwise
to 1000 µmol m−2 s−1 then to 1500
µmol m−2 s−1. Each leaf was first
allowed to achieve steady-state CO2 and water vapour exchange at each
increase of Q (Bernacchi
et al. 2003). Asat
was measured at a PPFD of 1500 µmol m−2
s−1 once the steady state had been achieved (Wang et al.,
2012).

Collection of tissue for RNA and carbohydrate analysis
For each genotype three biological replicates (separate plants) were sampled per
time-point, per treatment. The same leaf was used for both RNA and carbohydrate
analysis but a separate set of plants were used for measuring
photosynthesis.

Samples for RNA extraction
At each time-point, two 2-cm sections from the middle of the highest ligule
leaf, on either side of the central mid-rib (to facilitate grinding), were
quickly excised with a razor, placed in a 2-mL micro-centrifuge tube and
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immediately afterwards the carbohydrate
sample was harvested from the same leaf and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Four time-points were selected for transcriptional studies: 2 h, 4 h, 6 h
and 10 h for plants grown at 28 °C and 4 h (2 h after transfer), 6 h
(4 h after transfer) and 10 h (8 h after transfer) at 12 °C. Samples
were stored at –80 °C until processed.

Samples for carbohydrate analysis
An 8-cm section of leaf tissue on either side of the section harvested for
RNA was cut out with a razor blade, wrapped in aluminium foil and flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen. In addition to the time-points on which tissue
was harvested for RNA, there were two other time-points, 0 h (lights on) and
12 h (lights off) when tissue was harvested for carbohydrate analyses.
Carbohydrate samples were freeze-dried for 48 h (Freezemobile 6; Virtis Co
Inc., Gardiner, NY, USA) then cryomilled to a fine powder (Spex SamplePrep
6870 Large Freezer Mill; www.spexsampleprep.com). Three biological replicates (individual
plants) for each genotype were harvested at each time-point. A total of 30
plants per genotype were harvested for carbohydrate and/or RNA
extraction.

Carbohydrate analysis
Soluble sugar extraction
Approximately 20 mg (actual weight recorded) of each cryo-milled carbohydrate
sample was weighed into 2-mL screw-cap micro-centrifuge tubes. Sugars were
extracted in 1 mL of 80 % (v/v) ethanol heated in a water bath at 80
°C for 20 min. Samples were then cooled and centrifuged and the
supernatant extracted and added to a 15-mL tube. The process was repeated a
further three times. A 0·5-mL aliquot of the supernatant containing
the soluble sugars was added to a 2-mL micro-centrifuge tube and, along with
the remaining pellet containing the insoluble fraction (including starch),
dried down in a centrifugal evaporator (Jouan RC 1022, Saint Nazaire,
France) until all the solvent had evaporated. The dried-down residue from
the soluble fraction was then re-suspended in 0·5 mL of distilled
water. The dried pellet was stored at –20 °C until analysed
for starch.

Soluble sugar analysis
Soluble sugars were quantified enzymatically by the stepwise addition of
hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase and invertase (Jones et al., 1977). Samples
were quantified photometrically by measuring the change in wavelength at 340
nm, 15 min after the addition of each enzyme. Sucrose, glucose and fructose
were then quantified from a standard curve.

Starch quantification
Starch was quantified using a modified Megazyme protoco1 (Megazyme Total
Starch Assay Procedure, AOAC method 996·11; Megazyme International,
Ireland). Briefly, the dried pellet was resuspended in 0·4 mL of
0·2 m KOH, vortexed vigorously and heated to 90 °C in
a water bath for 15 min to facilitate gelatinization of the starch. A total
of 1·28 mL of 0·15 m NaOAc (pH 3·8) was added
to each tube and vortexed before the addition of 20 µL
α-amylase and 20 µL amyloglucosidase (Megazyme). After
incubation at 50 °C for 30 min, a 0·02-mL aliquot was
extracted and combined with 0·6 mL of GOPOD reagent (Megazyme). A
total of 0·2 mL of this reaction was assayed photometrically on a
96-well microplate at 510 nm against a water blank. Starch was quantified
from a standard curve. For both soluble sugar and starch quantification a
series of standards were included on each plate assayed. Each sample and
standard was tested in duplicate.

RNA extraction and quantitative real time PCR
RNA samples were ground in liquid N using a ball mill (Tissuelyser MM300, Retsch,
www.retsch.com). RNA was extracted
using RNeAsy Plant mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions and quantified on a NanoDrop (ND1000; Thermo Scientific; www.nanodrop.com). Contaminating genomic
DNA was removed by DNase treatment with Turbo DNase Free (Ambion, Austin, TX,
USA). cDNA was synthesized from 0·5 µg of total RNA with iScript
cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). qPCR was performed on an Applied
Biosystems, 7500 real time PCR system (Life Technologies; www.appliedbiosystems.com) with
QuantiFast SYBR Green (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Cycle conditions were 95 °C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95
°C for 10 s and a combined annealing/extension phase of 60 °C for
1 min, followed by a melt curve analysis. A dissociation curve for each reaction
was included to check for non-specific primer binding. In the absence of a
sequenced genome for Miscanthus, primers were designed from the
Sorghum bicolour (sorghum) and Zea mays
(maize) cDNA libraries available from the NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; see Table S2). Annotated sequences in
sorghum and maize are available for all genes tested from the NCBI database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The crossing point threshold was
calculated using the Applied Biosystems, 7500 real time PCR system software. The
crossing point threshold of two technical replicates was used to calculate
expression relative to an internal control gene. A number of control genes were
tested based upon published data. Czechowski et al. (2005) identified Yellow
Leaf Specific8 (YLS8) as a superior reference gene
for abiotic stress treatments in arabidopsis. An orthologue of this gene was
identified in maize and sorghum and found to be the most stably expressed in
Miscanthus in both warm (28 °C) and chilling (12
°C) conditions.

Leaf extension rate (LER)
The plants were grown, arranged and maintained as described above. This phase of
the experiment was initiated 24 h after the on-set on the chilling time course.
At the start of the experiment a stem with four to seven mature ligule leaves
was identified from six plants per genotype. With permanent marker, the highest
ligule and the point at which this met the unfurling leaf sheath was marked.
Treatments were as follows: 28 °C for 4 d (control) and 12 °C for
24 h (overlapping the chilling time course) before transfer back to 28 °C
for a further 3 d and 12 °C for 4 d. After 4 d the distance between the
marked ligule and the mark on the unfurling leaf was determined with callipers.
Plants were re-arranged within their respective trays and shifted within the
growth room every 3 d.

Statistical analyses
ANOVA's and Tukey's tests were carried out using GenStat version
13, t-tests were performed in Excel (Microsoft Inc.) and
α < 0·05 was applied for all analyses. Analysis for
carbohydrate data was carried out as follows. At 28 °C, a two-way ANOVA
was used to compare the effect of genotype and time into the photoperiod on
total soluble sugar; a corresponding Tukey's test identified significant
differences between genotypes for each time-point. At 12 °C, two-way
ANOVAs and corresponding Tukey's tests were used for each genotype to
determine significant differences between warm and chilled treatments for each
time-point. For the average increase and percentage increase in soluble sugars
after transfer, two, one-way ANOVAs with corresponding Tukey's tests were
used to identify significant differences. When single variables were compared
for morphological characteristics and LER, Student's two-tailed
t-tests were performed assuming unequal variances (α
< 0·05; Excel, Microsoft Inc.).

RESULTS
Phenotypes of selected genotypes
The four genotypes were selected because they represent two distinct species of
Miscanthus; M. sinensis and M.
sacchariflorus and an inter-specific hybrid M.
× giganteus (Table 1). The genotypes also represent a range of ploidy.
Three of the genotypes used in this study; Gig-311, Goliath and Sac-5 have
successfully been used in previous studies to investigate freezing tolerance
(Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski,
2000; Farrell et
al., 2006; Zub
et al., 2011). Although M.
× giganteus (hereafter referred to as Gig-311) is a
hybrid between an M. sacchariflorus (4n) and
an M. sinensis (2n) the physical measurements
of stem numbers and height place it as being more physically similar to
M. sacchariflorus clone Sac-5 (hereafter referred to as
Sac-5) than the diploid M. sinensis clone EMI-11 (hereafter
referred to as EMI-11). There were no significant differences between Gig-311
and Sac-5 for maximum ligule height or stem number, whereas both of these
genotypes were taller, with fewer stems than either EMI-11 or the triploid
M. sinensis clone Goliath (hereafter referred to as
Goliath). Both EMI-11 and Goliath had a similar number of stems with an average
of 61 % and 47 %, respectively, more than both Gig-311 and
Sac-5.

Photosynthesis under optimal temperatures and after transfer to chilling
conditions
Measurement of light-saturated photosynthesis (Asat)
revealed that at 28 °C Gig-311 and Sac-5 exhibited higher rates of
Asat throughout the day than either of the
M. sinensis genotypes (Fig. 1A). EMI-11 exhibited the lowest rate of
Asat after 4 h, thereafter showing a steady rate
of decline. All genotypes exhibited a rapid decline in
Asat within the first 2 h after transfer to 12
°C. Gig-311 and Sac-5 continued to decline in
Asat until 6 h, and Goliath until 10 h
(Fig. 1A). Gig-311
maintained the highest absolute Asat. At the end of
the time course (12 h) the rank order of Asat was
almost the same as at 28 °C with the two M. sinensis
genotypes having the lowest rate and Gig-311 and Sac-5 having the highest rate.
As a percentage of Asat at 28 °C,
M. × giganteus maintained the
highest percentage; Goliath and Sac-5 experienced the greatest decline
(Fig. 1B). At the end of
the time course, all genotypes had, relatively, declined to the same extent, to
approx. 65–68 % of their corresponding rate at 28 °C. Fig. 1. (A) Light saturated photosynthesis

Soluble carbohydrate contents at 28 °C
The most abundant soluble sugar was sucrose, followed by glucose and then
fructose in all the genotypes (Fig. 2A–C). In EMI-11 and Goliath, sucrose contents increased from
6 h and 4 h, respectively, to the end of the light period, whereas in Sac-5
sucrose concentrations peaked at 6 h and then declined. The separation in
accumulation trend between the M. sinensis genotypes and Sac-5
and Gig-311 was more obvious in their accumulation of glucose: EMI-11 and
Goliath reached peak concentrations at 10 h and 12 h, respectively, whereas
Gig-311 and Sac-5 reached peak concentration at 6 h. Fructose concentrations for
EMI-11 and Goliath were low throughout the experiment, dropping below detectable
concentrations at 0 h, 10 h and 12 h in EMI-11. Fructose concentrations were
higher in Sac-5 and Gig-311, again, peaking at 6 h. The genotypes with the
highest concentration of total soluble sugars consistently were Sac-5 and
Gig-311, followed, in order, by Goliath and finally EMI-11 (Table 2). This pattern is consistent with
their respective rates of photosynthesis throughout the day; the genotype with
the highest rate (Sac-5) accumulated the most soluble sugars and vice versa.

Changes in soluble carbohydrate content following transfer to chilling
conditions
After transfer to 12 °C an increase in sucrose, glucose and fructose
concentrations was observed in all genotypes, but to different extents
(Fig. 2A–C). The
greatest increase in sucrose, compared with the 28 °C treatment, was an
85 % increase in EMI-11 at 6 h (Fig. 2A and Table 3). The smallest change in sucrose was observed in
Sac-5 where concentrations remained comparable to the 28 °C treatment
throughout the experiment. Sac-5, however, accumulated elevated concentrations
of hexose in chilling conditions so the low concentrations of sucrose cannot be
attributed to the impairment of photosynthesis (Fig. 2B). EMI-11 and Goliath, like Sac-5, accumulated large
concentrations of glucose and fructose at 12 °C compared with 28
°C (B and C, respectively, in Fig. 2). Gig-311 accumulated the least concentration of
hexose, with very little change in glucose content between the 12 °C and
28 °C treatments. Despite not accumulating hexoses to the same extent as
the other genotypes, Gig-311, still exhibited the highest average concentration
of soluble sugars (Table 3). In contrast to the absolute values, the percentage increase in
soluble sugars revealed that EMI-11 and Goliath exhibited the greatest
percentage increase in soluble sugars during chilling and Sac-5 showed the
lowest. Gig-311 was intermediate between the two groups (Table 3). Table 3. Total soluble sugars (mg g−1 d. wt) and

Starch accumulation under optimal and chilling conditions
At 28 °C starch concentrations accumulated throughout the light period in
all genotypes (Fig. 3).
Although the total concentration of starch accumulated between the genotypes at
the end of the day was similar, the pattern of accumulation was different. In
the two M. sinensis genotypes starch accumulated fairly
linearly throughout the day, whereas concentrations of starch remained low in
Gig-311 and Sac-5 until 10 h when 71 % and 66 % of starch,
respectively, was accumulated in the last 2 h of the light period
(Fig. 3). In Gig-311 this
pattern of accumulation mirrored that of sucrose which was also more abundant in
the last 2 h of the light period (Figs 2 and 3).
Fig. 3. Starch contents at 28 °C (Warm) and at 12 °C
(Chilled) in the four genotypes. Values are means ± s.e.,
n = 3.



After transfer to chilling conditions, starch continued to accumulate in all
genotypes (Fig. 3). At 10 h,
EMI-11, Gig-311 and Sac-5 all contained more starch at 12 °C than their
warm-grown counterparts. In EMI-11 and Sac-5, a lower quantity of starch had
accumulated at the end of the day in the chilled plants and concentrations had
decreased in the last 2 h of the experiment.

Gene expression
To study molecular changes in response to chilling, transcripts homologous to
those that had previously been identified as being involved in carbohydrate
metabolism or stress responses in other species were identified in
Miscanthus (Table 4). The pattern of expression for
MsPGM1 was similar for the two M. sinensis
types showing a progressive increase in transcription from the point of transfer
to 12 °C (Fig. 4A).
Sac-5 and Gig-311 also had a very similar pattern of expression to each other
but different from the two M. sinensis genotypes where
expression peaked 2 h after transfer and then declined. The amplitude in
expression of MsPGM1 reflected the soluble sugar concentration;
Sac-5 showed the slightest increase in expression of MsPGM1 and
the smallest increase in soluble sugars, whereas EMI-11 showed the greatest
increase in soluble sugars and expression of MsPGM1. The
expression patterns for MsBAM3 (Fig. 4B) were similar to those of
MsPGM1, which is interesting as they are most commonly
regarded as being involved in opposite processes (breakdown and synthesis,
respectively; for a review, see Zeeman
et al., 2007. The greatest increase in
transcription of MsBAM3 (8-fold) was observed 4 h after
transfer to 12 °C in both EMI-11 and Sac-5. A lesser increase of 3- and
4-fold was observed in Goliath and Gig-311, respectively, at this same
time-point (Fig. 4B). The fold
change in expression pattern of MsBAM3 and
MsPGM1 in the four genotypes mirrored the respective
increases in sucrose accumulation at 12 °C (Figs 2A and 4A, B). A Pearson's
Correlation co-efficient revealed average R2 values
of 0·4–0·9 for all genotypes, for both genes (A and B,
respectively, in Fig. 5). Fig. 4. Fold change in expression between cold/warm conditions of (A)

The C-repeat binding factors/dehydration responsive element binding (CBF/DREB)
family of transcription factors have been proven to control the expression of a
swathe of cold-inducible transcripts in arabidopsis (Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1994; Gilmour et al.,
1998; Thomashow, 2010; Fowler et al.,
2005). The expression of this gene in Miscanthus showed
the greatest fold increase in expression in response to cold of all the
transcripts tested. Transcription was most highly expressed 2 h after transfer
in all genotypes but this increase was transient and, by the end of the
experiment, the change was <6-fold for all genotypes (Fig. 4C). Goliath expressed
MsCBF3 most highly with a 56-fold change, followed by
Sac-5, Gig-311 and EMI-11 which only increased 4-fold at the peak of
expression.

RD19a is under strong circadian regulation (Kreps et al., 2000)
and a large increase in transcription was observed progressively through the
light period in both temperature treatments in all genotypes (data not shown).
Sac-5 was unique amongst the genotypes for exhibiting an increase in expression
in response to chilling (Fig. 4D). Previous reports on the expression of RD19a
are mixed with some reporting cold induction (Robinson and Parkin, 2008) and some reporting only
drought induction (Koizumi et
al., 1993; Coupe
et al., 2003). In Sac-5, transcription reached a
2·7-fold increase at 12 °C compared with 28 °C 4 h after
transfer and then declined.

LER
All genotypes showed a decline in LER after 4 d at 12 °C, although in
Gig-311 this difference was not significant (Fig. 6). Sac-5 and Goliath showed the greatest reduction in
LER at 12 °C with reductions of 97 % and 86 %,
respectively. In both EMI-11 and Gig-311 a slight increase in LER was observed
after treatment for 24 h at 12 °C compared with the control plants
maintained at 28 °C. In Goliath there was a 79 % reduction in
plants treated to 24 h at 12 °C compared with warm-grown plants,
indicating that short-term chilling had a lasting detrimental effect on LER.

DISCUSSION
Photosynthesis and carbohydrate phenotypes under optimal growing
temperatures
Under optimal growing conditions the rate of photosynthesis
(Asat) was highest for Sac-5 and Gig-311
throughout the experiment. The two M. sinensis genotypes,
particularly EMI-11 were, comparably, low. Previous reports have described the
superiority of the photosynthesis rates at lower temperatures in
M. × giganteus compared with maize
(Naidu et al.,
2003; Wang et
al., 2008a; Dohleman and Long, 2009). In field trials in
Illinois, M. × giganteus owes its high
productivity to a high green leaf area index and the ability to develop a
functional canopy at lower temperatures (Dohleman and Long, 2009). The four genotypes used in this study were
selected based, in part, upon their differing morphology. Therefore, despite the
lower rate of photosynthesis in individual leaves of the M.
sinensis genotypes, the higher stem density could still result in a
greater capacity for carbon fixation on a per plant basis. Studies are currently
underway to investigate this hypothesis.

Under warm conditions, soluble carbohydrates and starch showed a diurnal pattern
of accumulation similar to that reported in other species such as maize, cotton
and soybean (Huber et
al., 1984; Hendrix and
Huber, 1986; Kalt-Torres
et al., 1987). Sac-5 and EMI-11 showed the most
contrasting carbohydrate phenotypes. Miscanthus sacchariflorus
genotypes are phylogenetically more closely related to sugarcane than M.
sinensis (Hodkinson
et al., 2002) and many aspects of the difference
in the carbohydrate phenotype of Sac-5 and EMI-11 reflect this. For example, the
reported mid-day concentration of sucrose in sugarcane leaves is 48 mg g
−1 d. wt compared with 40 mg g−1 d. wt
in Sac-5 (Iskandar et
al., 2011). In EMI-11, mid-day sucrose levels were 7 mg
g−1 d. wt which is more similar to sucrose concentrations
reported in maize of 8 mg g−1 d. wt (Kalt-Torres et al., 1987). In terms
of sucrose content, Sac-5 is therefore more similar to sugarcane and EMI-11 is
more similar to maize. In Sac-5 the pattern of soluble sugar accumulation is
also comparable to sugarcane (Lehrer
et al., 2007), with concentration peaking around
mid-day and then declining. The pattern of accumulation in EMI-11 showed a
progressive increase in soluble sugars from mid-day as has also been reported in
the temperate grasses barley and switchgrass (Greenfield and Smith, 1974; Sicher et al., 1984).

Physiological responses of Miscanthus to chilling
After transfer to 12 °C, all of the genotypes suffered a large and rapid
decline in photosynthesis. At the same time, an increase in soluble sugar
concentration was observed in all genotypes although, proportionately, less so
in Sac-5 and Gig-311. The accumulation of soluble sugars and starch is probably
the result of the combination of the remaining photosynthesis and a decline in
growth rate, reducing carbon utilization. In sunflower plants grown at 30
°C and then abruptly shifted to 13 °C a similar increase in
soluble sugars and starch was observed as in our study (Paul et al., 1991). Carbon labelling
demonstrated that carbohydrate export was greatly reduced following the
application of chilling stress, and the authors concluded that in chilling
conditions assimilation exceeds utilization resulting in carbohydrate
accumulation (Paul et
al., 1991). A study by Clifton-Brown and Jones (1997) showed that at progressively cooler
temperatures the leaf elongation rate of many genotypes including Gig-311 and
Sac-5 were reduced. The reduction in demand for sugars for growth during
chilling therefore explains the observations. The two genotypes that suffered
the greatest percentage decline in photosynthesis were Goliath and Sac-5. These
two genotypes also showed both a large decline in LER after 4 d at 12 °C
and reduced LER after being returned to 28 °C after only 24 h in chilling
temperatures. Therefore either percentage decline in
Asat in the first 4–8 h after chilling or
a combination of low LER during chilling and a failure to recover LER were
suitable measurements of chilling-shock sensitivity in
Miscanthus.

The failure of Sac-5 to accumulate sucrose during chilling-shock is similar to
the observations of Du and Nose
(2002) who reported that a chilling sensitive variety of sugarcane
failed to accumulate soluble sugars (including hexoses) in response to chilling.
That Sac-5 accumulated large amounts of hexose in response to chilling but not
sucrose indicates that the function of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and/or
cFru-1,6-BPase (FBPase) may have been impaired by chilling. In the
chilling-sensitive sugarcane genotype a decrease in SPS enzyme activity was
observed after only 4 h of exposure to chilling, whereas no difference was
observed in tolerant genotypes (Du and
Nose, 2002). Furthermore, in maize plants exposed to short-term
chilling conditions, FBPase activity was reduced by half even after a return to
optimal conditions, demonstrating lasting damage to the enzyme (Kingston-Smith et al.,
1997). The superior photosynthetic performance of M.
× giganteus compared with maize under chilling
conditions has been attributed, in part, to the increased abundance of pyruvate
orthophospate dikinase (PPDK) (Naidu
et al., 2003; Wang et al.,
2008b). The poorer photosynthetic performance during
chilling of EMI-11, Goliath and Sac-5, compared with Gig-311 may reflect a
reduced ability to retain activity or abundance of PPDK during chilling.
However, our results also suggest that the resilience of other enzymes, such as
SPS or FBPase, may also be indicative of the performance of different genotypes
of Miscanthus under chilling conditions.

In arabidopsis the accumulation of soluble sugars has been attributed, at least
in part, to the hydrolysis of starch (Kaplan and Guy, 2004, 2005; Yano et
al., 2005). In Miscanthus none of the
increase in soluble sugars after only a 2-h exposure to chilling conditions
could be attributed to starch breakdown as starch continued to accumulate until
at least 8 h after exposure. The rate of starch accumulation following chilling
was actually greater than at 28 °C between 6 and 8 h in all genotypes
except Goliath. This response has also been reported in maize (Hodges et al., 1997)
and sunflower (Paul et
al., 1991) but the contrary has been observed in
arabidopsis (Yano et al.,
2005; Kaplan and Guy,
2004, 2005). Both maize
and sunflower are sensitive to chilling and freezing, although genotypic
variation in tolerance exists for both (Hodges et al., 1997; Allen and Ort, 2001; Balbuena et al., 2011). However,
arabidopsis is tolerant to freezing as long as a period of acclimation is first
experienced (Thomashow, 1999). The
reported Lt50 (the temperature at which the calculated percentage
damage would exceed 50 %) for acclimated arabidopsis is –7 to
–12 °C (Hannah et
al., 2006) which is colder than the Lt50 for
shoots of acclimated Miscanthus genotypes which ranges between
–6 °C and –9 °C (Farrell et al., 2006). In
arabidopsis the breakdown of starch following exposure to chilling conditions
has been correlated with freezing tolerance (Kaplan and Guy, 2005). In
Miscanthus, maize and sensitive genotypes of sunflower, the
absence of this response may be representative of their greater freezing
susceptibility.

Consistent with previous reports of the greater tolerance of M.
× giganteus to sub-optimal temperatures (Naidu et al., 2003;
Farage et al.,
2006; Wang et
al., 2008a), Gig-311 maintained the
highest photosynthesis rates and showed no reduction in LER in response to
chilling. A number of research groups, from different countries, have observed
superiority in the performance of M. ×
giganteus genotypes for many different traits. This is
particularly interesting as they do not all represent the same clone. A recent
study into the performance of different genotypes of Miscanthus
in Poland included two triploid M. ×
giganteus originating from separate hybridization events
(Jezowski et al.,
2011). Both M. × giganteus
genotypes yielded more than the M. sinensis intraspecific
hybrids and the interspecific M. sacchariflorus ×
M. sinensis diploid hybrids (Jezowski et al., 2011). This
finding, along with our own and the numerous other reports of the superior
performance of M. × giganteus (Clifton-Brown and Jones, 1997; Naidu et al., 2003;
Naidu and Long, 2004; Wang et al.,
2008a, b; Dohleman and Long, 2009; Jezowski et al., 2011), provides evidence for the
release of hybrid vigour in the triploid progeny of tetraploid M.
sacchariflorus × diploid M. sinensis.

Gene expression in response to chilling
In arabidopsis the expression of β-amylase is known to be
stimulated by cold (Nielsen et
al., 1997; Kaplan
and Guy, 2004) and a high sugar status (Mita et al., 1995, 1997). Whether induction during cold
stress is actually the result of sugar accumulation rather than induction being
directed through a cold-signalling pathway, is unclear. We observed a strong
correlation between the increase in expression of the two
carbohydrate-metabolizing transcripts, MsPGM1 and
MsBAM3, and the accumulation of sucrose in each genotype,
suggesting that this was the cause of induction. However, the greatest
fold-change in expression of MsBAM3 was observed in Sac-5,
which had the lowest increase in soluble sugar of the four genotypes, suggesting
that the sugar responsiveness of MsBAM3 varies between
genotypes. Different degrees of increased expression for a
β-amylase gene have also been observed in
arabidopsis with the Landsberg erecta accession showing reduced
expression compared with Columbia after sugar feeding (Mita et al., 1997). This indicates
that allelic variation controls induction of β-amylase
in response to increasing sugar contents which may account for the difference
observed here. It is interesting to note that the highest increase in expression
of MsBAM3 was observed in Sac-5 and EMI-11, and these were the
only genotypes to show a reduced quantity of starch at the end of the
experiment. The expression level of neither MsBAM3 nor
MsPGM1 strongly reflected the degree of chilling-shock
sensitivity in the four genotypes tested; therefore we conclude that these
transcripts are not suitable markers of sensitivity.

Arabidopsis RD19a has been reported to be cold inducible (Robinson and Parkin, 2008) but more
often as being specifically drought responsive (Koizumi et al., 1993; Coupe et al., 2003).
Sac-5 was the only genotype to show an increase in expression of this transcript
in response to chilling. Although the plants used in this study were kept well
watered throughout the experiment, during chilling, water stress may occur in
chilling-sensitive plants due to reduced xylem hydraulics which can drastically
impair water uptake (Allen and Ort,
2001). This is particularly the case if the roots cool more quickly
that the above-ground tissues (Allen and
Ort, 2001). To this effect, rhizome shape could affect chilling
tolerance; M. sacchariflorus genotypes (including Sac-5) have a
spreading-rhizome morphology, whereas M. sinensis and Gig-311
have compact ‘tussock’ rhizomes (Clifton-Brown and Lewandowski, 2000). A spreading
morphology may expose a greater surface area for rapid cooling than the compact
form, resulting in acute water stress and the subsequent expression of
drought-responsive genes during chilling-shock.

The CBF/DREB family of transcription factors are rapidly induced in response to
cold and activate the expression of a large family of cold-inducible genes
(Gilmour et al.,
1998; Fowler and Thomashow,
2002). In arabidopsis sequencing of CBF1,
-2 and -3 from accessions from a
latitudinal gradient revealed polymorphisms, particularly amongst southern
European-derived accessions compared with northern-origin accessions The
observed polymorphisms affected the expression of downstream genes with southern
accessions showing the lowest level of expression and the greatest
susceptibility to freezing (Zhen and
Ungerer, 2008). Our study identified that MsCBF3 was
most highly expressed in the genotypes that showed the greatest percentage
reduction in Asat and LER and recovery. Studies are
now underway to determine whether expression level and/or sequence polymorphisms
of MsCBF3 are a good indicator of chilling tolerance or
susceptibility in a larger selection of Miscanthus plants
originating from a latitudinal gradient in Asia. If, similarly to arabidopsis,
gene polymorphisms relating to tolerance are identified, this gene may be used
as a molecular marker to screen seedlings and potential parents for chilling
tolerance.

In summary: under optimal conditions the M. sacchariflorus
genotype showed a diurnal pattern of carbohydrate accumulation that was similar
to sugarcane, whereas the M. sinensis genotypes more closely
resembled temperate grasses. In keeping with its reported superior performance
in prolonged cool temperatures, M. ×
giganteus also maintains a greater degree of resilience to
chilling-shock than other genotypes. The failure of M.
sacchariflorus (Sac-5) to accumulate sucrose indicates impairment
in the enzyme function of SPS or FBPase during chilling. The most
chilling-sensitive genotypes most highly expressed the candidate transcription
factor, MsCBF3, suggesting that this gene may be a suitable
molecular marker of chilling tolerance or susceptibility.
