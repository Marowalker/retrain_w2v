quantitative and qualitative analysis by gas chromatography (GC)–flame

emitted compounds showed qualitative homogeneity, being mainly composed of
methyl benzoate with quantitative variation, the profiles of endogenous
compounds showed both qualitative and quantitative variation. A negative
correlation was found between the evaporation ratio and boiling point of each

the emitted component, resulting in the reduction of qualitative variation in
floral scent. In conclusion, floral scent diversity results from variation in
both the endogenous production and the evaporation rate of the individual
volatile compounds.

INTRODUCTION
Petunia axillaris is considered to be one of the parental species of
garden petunia and is widely distributed in temperate South America. This species
comprises three allopatric infraspecific taxa: subsp. axillaris,
subsp. parodii and subsp. subandina.
Petunia axillaris flowers emit a strong musty scent at night
only. This property is thought to help attract nocturnally active hawk moths as
specific pollinators, resulting in maintenance of reproductive isolation in the wild
from syntopic scentless species such as P. integrifolia (Ando et al., 2001).

Among the subspecies of P. axillaris are various lines emitting
sensorially different scents (Hoballah et
al., 2005). The analysis of variations in floral scent among
genetically close individuals is a powerful approach to understanding the mechanisms
for generating scent diversity. Such studies have been carried out for
Magnolia, Ficus and Silene,
and the qualitative and quantitative variations among these plants' scents have been
discussed in relation to their pollinators (Azuma
et al., 2001; Grison-Pigé et al., 2002; Dötterl et al., 2005). To discover the
basis of scent diversity in the genus Clarkia, the gene for
linalool synthase was cloned, and its expression was compared between the scented
species C. breweri and the scentless C. conncina.
The results suggested that this single enzyme could account for the difference in
floral scent between these closely related species (Pichersky et al., 1994, 1995; Raguso and Pichersky,
1995). The success of these studies prompted the present investigation into
the mechanisms leading to floral scent diversity in P.
axillaris.

Floral scent is a mixture of volatile compounds, including aromatics, terpenoids and
fatty acid derivatives, the composition of which determines the scent properties of
a flower (Knudsen et al.,
1993). In petunia, floral scents are composed of aromatic compounds
biosynthesized from the common precursor phenylalanine (Boatright et al., 2004; Fig. 1). Recently, two enzymes involved in the metabolism of
floral aromatic volatiles have been identified and characterized from
Petunia hybrida ‘Mitchell’:
S-adenosyl-l-methionine:benzoic acid/salicylic acid
carboxyl methyltransferase (PhBSMT1/2; Negre
et al., 2003) and benzoyl-CoA:benzyl
alcohol/phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (PhBPBT; Boatright et al., 2004). In addition, a novel R2R3-type
MYB transcription factor, ODORANT1, has been identified that
regulates the coordinate expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in diurnal
fluctuation of scent emission (PhODO1; Verdonk
et al., 2005). Enzymes and regulatory factors such
as these may be involved in generating the diversity of floral scents in P.
axillaris.


Fig. 1 Proposed biosynthetic pathway of aromatic scent compounds. The volatile
aromatic scent compounds enclosed in boxes were detected in floral scent
and in flower tissue of P. axillaris.




The boiling points of most of the volatile compounds identified as floral scents
range from 150 to 350 °C. These substances are present in floral
tissues mostly as liquids or in solution, and only a portion is emitted as floral
scents. Therefore, evaporation is regarded as an important process regulating floral
scent emission. In a previous study, a comparison of the relative amounts of emitted
and endogenous scent compounds of one line of P. axillaris subsp.
axillaris indicated that emission was basically a physical
phenomenon (Oyama-Okubo et al.,
2005). Furthermore, the abundance of endogenous compounds in this line
was determined by the rates of biosynthesis and degradation, and was reflected in
the profile of emitted compounds according to the vapour pressure of each compound.
These findings suggested that emitted and endogenous components must both be
analysed independently to gain information about the relative contributions of
evaporation and endogenous production to the final scent composition. Based on this
concept, 13 specimens of P. axillaris of varying scents were chosen
for analysis of the basis of floral scent diversity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant material
Plants of P. axillaris (Lam.) Britton, Stern & Poggenb.
subsp. axillaris, subsp. parodii (Steere)
Cabrera and subsp. subandina T. Ando (Ando, 1996) were raised from seeds collected from several
natural populations in Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina. Thirteen individuals from
among these plants were chosen at random and were found to vary in scent
strength (Table 1 and Fig. 2). In the specimen code, the initial
letter and number designate the herbarium specimen code, with the letter
indicating the country of the origin: A (Argentina), B (Brazil) or U (Uruguay).
The subspecies abbreviation and the individual code are indicated by the
following letters and numbers (AXI, subsp. axillaris; PAR,
subsp. parodii; and SUB, subsp. subandina).
These lines were vegetatively propagated in a greenhouse 2 months before the
experiments. Just before the experiments, the plants were acclimated for at
least a week in a growth chamber at a constant temperature of
25 °C under a photosynthetic photon flux density of about
250 μmol m−2 s−1 and a
12 h/12 h (0600 h–1800 h
light/1800 h–0600 h dark) photoperiod.

axillaris, subsp. parodii and
subsp. subandina are indicated by circles,
triangles and squares, respectively. Approximate boundaries of the
SI and SC populations are shown by solid and broken lines,
respectively. (After Kokubun
et al., 2006.)

Collection of emitted volatiles
Emitted volatile compounds were collected by the headspace method (Oka et al., 1999). Tedlar
Bags (500 mL volume, GL science, Tokyo, Japan) were placed over the
P. axillaris flowers to be sampled. A constant stream of
air (approx. 500 mL min−1) was filtered through
activated charcoal (Oka et al.,
1999) and then piped through the bag, and volatiles were collected
with Tenax-TA (150 mg, GL science, Tokyo, Japan) traps. The relative
humidity in the bags was approx. 50 %. Headspace collection was started
at 2300 h and finished at 2400 h. Thereafter, the sampled
flowers were harvested to determine the endogenous concentrations of scent
compounds, following the experimental design of the previous study (Oyama-Okubo et al.,
2005).

Preparation of emitted volatiles
Scent compounds were extracted from the Tenax-TA four times, using pentane and
diethyl ether (5 mL each) alternately (Oyama-Okubo et al., 2005). After addition of ethyl
decanoate (20 μg) as an internal standard, the extract was dried
over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated at 40 °C in a
water bath.

Preparation of endogenous volatiles
Flowers were harvested at 2400 h after collecting the emitted volatile
compounds, and the flower tissues (excluding the calyx) were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and ground in a mortar. The resulting powder was extracted twice with
pentane (5 mL each) in a microwave oven (700 W) for
20 s. Ethyl decanoate was added as an internal standard. The extract was
then dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated at
40 °C in a water bath.

GC–MS and GC analysis
Capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was
performed using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973N
Mass Selective Detector (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA) (Oyama-Okubo et al., 2005).
The GC was equipped with a splitless injector and a DB-WAX capillary column
(30 m in length, 0·25 mm i.d. and
0·25 μm film thickness). The column oven temperature was
kept at 45 °C for the first 2 min, then increased by
3 °C min−1 to 220 °C and
maintained at 220 °C for 10 min. Injection, interface
and ion source temperatures were 250, 280 and 250 °C,
respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas. GC analysis was performed
using an Agilent 6850 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE,
USA) monitored by a flame ionization detector (FID). Analytical conditions were
the same as for GC–MS described above. The amounts of each volatile were
calculated by comparison with the peak area of the internal standard. The
compound identifications were made by NIST02 library search provided with the
GC–MS software. Identification was substantiated on the basis of mass
spectra and retention time by subjecting authentic samples to GC–MS
analysis under the same conditions.

RESULTS
Components of emitted volatiles
Benzaldehyde, methyl benzoate, phenyl acetaldehyde, benzyl acetate, benzyl
alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, iso-eugenol and benzyl benzoate were
detected as emitted volatiles in many of the P. axillaris lines
(Fig. 3A; details are shown in Table 2). The total amounts ranged from
0·6 nmol per flower in A130SUB9 to 228·1 nmol
per flower in U242AXI4. Methyl benzoate was the most predominant compound in all
lines and accounted for 34–100 % of the total amount of
volatiles emitted. In other words, the observed variation in the total amount of
emission was almost entirely accounted for by the variation in the amount of
methyl benzoate emission. The second most abundant compound was benzaldehyde in
U220PAR10, benzyl alcohol in A203SUB8 and U238PAR15, and
iso-eugenol in B58AXI9. 2-Phenylethanol and the other compounds
were minor components in all lines.

Components of endogenous volatiles
Most compounds that were detected in the emitted samples were also detected as
endogenous components in the flowers harvested at 2400 h (Fig. 3B; details in Table 3). Benzaldehyde was detected as an emitted
component only in A203SUB8, B1320AXI10, B298PAR7 and U238PAR15, as was methyl
benzoate in A130SUB9. Conversely, some compounds were detected only in the
endogenous samples, such as benzyl benzoate in B1320AXI13 and vanillin in
U220PAR10. For each line, the endogenous composition was markedly different from
the emitted profile. The proportion of higher boiling point compounds, e.g.
iso-eugenol or benzyl benzoate, was higher in the
endogenous composition than in the emitted profile; the opposite was observed
for the lower boiling point compounds, e.g. benzaldehyde and methyl benzoate.
The total amounts of endogenous volatiles ranged from undetectable in A130SUB9
to 519·9 nmol per flower in U1AXI. No direct correlation was
found between the total amounts of the emitted and endogenous components.

Relationship between boiling points and emission ratios
Plant lines that yielded relatively stable qualitative data for at least three
compounds were chosen for further analysis. For each compound, the logarithm of
the ratio between the amount emitted and the endogenous amount was plotted
against the boiling point. The compounds included in the analysis were
benzaldehyde, phenyl acetaldehyde, methyl benzoate, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenyl
ethanol, iso-eugenol and benzyl benzoate. As predicted from
physical theory, the analyses showed a nearly linear negative correlation
between he emission ratio and boiling point for all the plant lines. The data
for U242AXI4 are a typical example (Fig.
4). The regression equations for the various lines are as follows:
y = −0·014x +
2·969 (A139SUB2), y =
−0·014x + 1·954 (U238PAR15),
y = −0·024x +

DISCUSSION
Similar to results previously obtained for the line U1AXI (Oyama-Okubo et al., 2005), all of the floral
scent compounds detected in the headspace and flower tissue of the 12 additional
lines of P. axillaris used in the present study were again aromatic
compounds. The mixture of emitted volatiles contained predominantly methyl benzoate,
resulting in qualitative homogeneity with quantitative variation (Fig. 3A). In other words, the total emission of
each line was greatly affected by the amount of methyl benzoate emission. The
correlation between sensory strength at 2400 h and the total amount of
emitted volatiles seems to be accounted for by this property (data not shown).

No association was found between the morphological characteristics of the subspecies
of P. axillaris and their floral scent properties (discussed
below). Climatic conditions may not exert the same selection pressure on floral
scent as they do on plant morphology (Fig.
2). Interestingly, U242AXI4 and U1AXI, which emitted relatively large amounts
of scent compounds, are the only self-incompatible lines among the specimens studied
here. This finding suggests an ecological role for floral scents in helping to
attract pollinators to cross-pollinate self-incompatible lines (Ando et al., 1998; Tsukamoto et al., 1998; Kokubun et al., 2006).

For each line, the endogenous volatile composition was markedly different from the
emitted composition (Fig. 3A, B). Both
qualitative and quantitative variation was found among the endogenous profiles.
Based on the observed endogenous profiles, the C6–C1
pathway leading to methyl benzoate and benzyl benzoate is active in all lines (Fig. 1). The qualitative variation probably
arises from differences in the activity of the C6–C2
pathway, leading to 2-phenyl ethanol and phenyl acetaldehyde, and the
C6–C3 pathway, leading to
iso-eugenol. The quantitative variation seems to depend mainly on
the activity of a common pathway upstream of these three branched pathways. This
possibility is currently being investigated by analysing the concentrations of
phenylalanine and other precursors.

The boiling points of the substances detected in this study range from 179 to
324 °C (Tables 2 and 3). The ratio of the emitted amount to the
endogenous amount of each compound is correlated with its vapour pressure (Fig. 4). A negative correlation between the
emitted/endogenous ratio and boiling point was obtained for all examined lines,
indicating that emission of floral scents can be understood as primarily a physical
phenomenon in P. axillaris, as the previous study concluded (Oyama-Okubo et al., 2005).
Lower boiling point compounds were always over-represented in the emission profile
relative to their endogenous concentrations, reducing the qualitative variation in
the emitted component among the lines. Variation in the regression equations
describing the relationship between emission ratios and vapour pressures was
observed among the P. axillaris lines. These differences may
suggest the operation of a physiological mechanism that regulates the evaporation
process.

This study demonstrates that floral scent diversity is generated by variation in both
endogenous production and evaporation of volatile compounds. So far, studies of
floral scent have tended to concentrate on biosynthesis of the compounds, including
the isolation of biosynthetic enzymes and the cloning of their genes. An
understanding of the evaporation process in each plant is also necessary for a full
comprehension of floral scent production.
