The release of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from injured plant tissue affects
multiple ecological interactions. Plant-derived HCN can act as a defence
against herbivores and also plays an important role in plant–pathogen
interactions. Crucial for activity as a feeding deterrent is the amount of
HCN generated per unit time, referred to as cyanogenic capacity (HCNc).
Strong intraspecific variation in HCNc has been observed among cyanogenic
plants. This variation, in addition to genotypic variability (e.g. in
Trifolium repens), can result from modifications in the
expression level of the enzymes involved in either cyanogenic precursor
formation or HCN release (as seen in Sorghum bicolor and
Phaseolus lunatus). Thus, a modification or modulation
of HCNc in reaction to the environment can only be achieved from one to the
next generation when under genetic control and within days or hours when
transcriptional regulations are involved. In the present study, it is shown
that in rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) HCNc is modulated
by post-translational activity regulation of the key enzymes for cyanide
release.

Methods
Linamarase (LIN) and hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) activity was determined by
colorimetric assays utilizing dissociation of the substrates
p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and
acetone cyanohydrin, respectively.

Key Results
In rubber tree leaves, LIN and HNL show up to ten-fold increased activity in
response to tissue damage. This enzyme activation occurs within seconds and
results in accelerated HCN formation. It is restricted to the damaged leaf
area and depends on the severity of tissue damage.

Conclusions
LIN and HNL activation (in contrast to genetic and transcriptional
regulations) allows an immediate, local and damage type-dependent modulation
of the cyanogenic response. Accordingly, this post-translational activation
plays a decisive role in the defence of H. brasiliensis
against herbivores as well as pathogens and may allow more flexible
reactions in response to these different antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
Cyanogenic plants are capable of releasing hydrogen cyanide (HCN) in response to
tissue damage. This phenomenon, cyanogenesis, is widespread in the plant kingdom
(Møller and Seigler, 1999).
More than 3000 cyanogenic plant species have been described (Seigler and Brinker, 1993; Webber and Miller, 2008), including many economically
important crops such as cassava (Manihot esculenta), sorghum
(Sorghum bicolor), lima bean (Phaseolus
lunatus), white clover (Trifolium repens) and the
rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis (McMahon et al., 1995). HCN is highly
toxic due to inhibition of the mitochondrial respiration pathway (e.g. Solomonson, 1981). Cyanogenesis can
therefore function as an efficient defence mechanism, especially against herbivores
(Nahrstedt, 1985; Schappert and Shore, 1999; Gleadow and Woodrow, 2002; Ballhorn et al., 2005).
On the other hand, HCN can also inhibit active defence reactions in the cyanogenic
plant itself (Lieberei et
al., 1989, 1996;
reviewed by Møller, 2010).
Cyanogenic plants have thus repeatedly been found to be susceptible to
cyanide-resistant pathogens (Lieberei,
2007; Ballhorn et
al., 2010a; Ballhorn, 2011).

HCN is released from cyanogenic precursors, in general from cyanogenic glycosides,
consisting of α-hydroxynitriles stabilized by a sugar moiety (Conn, 1981; Hösel, 1981). In rubber tree, the two aliphatic
cyanogenic glucosides (CGs) linamarin and lotaustralin are accumulated, with
linamarin being the dominating CG (Butler,
1965; Lieberei et
al., 1986; Selmar
et al., 1988). Linamarin and lotaustralin are
synthesized from the protein amino acids valine and isoleucine, respectively (Conn, 1981). This synthesis is catalysed
by two types of cytochrome P450 (CYP79D1/D2 and CYP71E) and a UDP-glycosyl
transferase as reported for cassava (Hahlbrock
and Conn, 1971; Koch et
al., 1992; Andersen
et al., 2000; Bak et al., 2002). In a first step valine and
isoleucine are converted to their respective oximes (catalysed by CYP79D1/D2). The
oximes are substrate of CYP71E, which catalyses the formation of nitrile. In a final
step the glucose moiety is added by UDP-glycosyl transferase (Siritunga and Sayre, 2004). Nielsen et al. (2008) have shown that in
sorghum these enzymes compose a metabolon linked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membrane. In CG degradation, i.e. in HCN release, two enzymes are involved. First, a
β-glucosidase, linamarase (LIN) in H. brasiliensis, splits
off the sugar moiety (Hösel,
1981). Subsequently, a hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) catalyses the
decomposition of the cyanohydrin to yield HCN and a carbonyl compound. Although
acetone cyanohydrin breaks down spontaneously, HNL accelerates HCN formation
considerably (Hösel, 1981; Selmar et al., 1989). To
avoid the release of HCN from intact tissue, CGs and their degrading enzymes are
stored in different cell compartments. In cassava leaves, for instance, the major
fractions of LIN and HNL are located in the apoplast whilst linamarin and
lotaustralin are stored in the vacuoles (reviewed by McMahon et al., 1995; White et al., 1998).
Similar findings have been reported for rubber tree (Gruhnert et al., 1994). In sorghum
leaves, additional distribution to different tissues has been observed. Whereas the
CG dhurrin is stored primarily in the vacuoles of the epidermal cell layer,
dhurrinase (β-glucosidase) and mandelonitrile lyase are located in the
chloroplasts and the cytosol of the parenchyma cells, respectively (Kojima et al., 1979;
Thayer and Conn, 1981; Wajant et al.,
1994).

The amount of HCN released per unit time, i.e. cyanogenic capacity (HCNc; Lieberei, 1988) depends mainly on the
activity of LIN and HNL and on the amount of CGs stored in a particular plant
tissue. The latter is defined as the cyanogenic potential (HCNp; Loyd and Gray, 1970). HCNc can differ
significantly between individuals of the same plant species (Hughes, 1981; Ballhorn et al., 2005) and represents an important
parameter for the classification of cyanogenic plants. Depending on HCNc plants are
classified as highly (HC) or low (LC) cyanogenic (Ballhorn et al., 2005). Only HC plants
release a requisite amount of cyanide at a rate sufficient to repel herbivores (e.g.
Ballhorn et al.,
2005). Concomitantly, because these plants produce large quantities of
HCN, they are also more susceptible to cyanide-resistant pathogens than LC congeners
(Lieberei, 2007; Ballhorn et al.,
2010a).

HCNc can be regulated at the gene level. Depending on the number of functional
alleles encoding LIN as well as the enzymes participating in CG biosynthesis, white
clover may be HC, LC or even acyanogenic if no functional alleles are present (Hughes, 1981). The cyanogenic capacity of
H. brasiliensis and lima bean also is genotype-dependent (Lieberei, 1988; Ballhorn et al., 2005). In contrast, the
CG content of sorghum plants is largely determined by transcriptional activity
regulation of the enzymes involved in CG biosynthesis (Busk and Møller, 2002). Whilst developing
seedlings up to 7 d old store large amounts of CGs, their HCNp decreases strongly
during further development (Halkier and
Møller, 1989; Busk and
Møller, 2002). Increased β-glucosidase activity in response
to herbivore feeding has been observed in P. lunatus leaves 72 h
after the onset of attack (Ballhorn et
al., 2006). This time frame indicates that
β-glucosidase activity, besides genetic control, may also be regulated at the
transcript level. White et
al. (1998) demonstrated that the absence of HNL activity in
cassava root tissue is associated with very low steady-state amounts of HNL
transcripts. In rubber tree, decreasing HNL activity has been observed during leaf
development (Selmar, 1986). These
results suggest strongly that HNL activity, as with β-glucosidase activity,
also may be regulated at the transcript level.

Here we show that in H. brasiliensis leaves LIN and HNL activity
increases within seconds in response to tissue damage. In contrast to genetic and
transcriptional regulation, this post-translational activation of LIN and HNL
facilitates an immediate modulation of HCNc in response to attack.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Plant material
Rubber tree seedlings [Euphorbiaceae: Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.
ex. A.Juss) Müll.Arg.] were cultivated under greenhouse conditions at a
daytime temperature of 24–28 °C and a night temperature of 22
°C. Relative humidity was maintained at 60–80 %. Plants
were illuminated 12 h per day using high-pressure sodium lamps (IP 55 Philips
400 W, Hamburg, Germany). Irrigation was computer-controlled; the amount of
water lost to evaporation was replenished automatically.

As with many tropical plants, H. brasiliensis exhibits rhythmic
growth (Hallé and Martin,
1968); all leaves of a new shoot develop simultaneously. Four
developmental leaf stages can be distinguished (Lieberei, 1984). Developmental stages A, B and C
refer to immature leaves showing no lignification, whereas mature D stage leaves
are fully lignified (Voß,
2001). Only leaves of developmental stages B, C and D were used in
our experiments; stage A leaves were excluded due to their small size (≤3
mm).

Mechanical tissue damage and sampling
Mechanical damage of leaf tissue was achieved using a dissection pin. The number
of punctures applied per defined leaf area (0·32 cm2)
simulated a low (75 punctures) or a high (150 punctures) degree of tissue
damage. Treated leaf areas were excised using a cork borer (diameter =
0·64 cm) 5 min after mechanical damage. Excisions of surrounding, but
intact, leaf tissue served as controls. Leaf discs were transferred immediately
to Eppendorf tubes containing 100 µL cooled (4 °C) phosphate
buffer solution (67 mm phosphate, pH 6·4) as well as
polyvinylpoly-pyrrolidone (Sigma Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany), then
homogenized on ice using a pestle. The pestle was washed with a further 100
µL of phosphate buffer. The homogenates were centrifuged for 20 min at 16
000g (Heraeus Instruments Biofuge fresco,
Hanau, Germany). An aliquot of each supernatant (150 µL, defined as
protein raw extract) was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and subsequently
used for determination of β-glucosidase (BGLU), LIN and HNL activity. The
aliquots were also tested for residual amounts of linamarin and lotaustralin
using the Spectroquant Cyanide Test Kit (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) as described
by Ballhorn et al.
(2005). No cyanide could be detected in any of the samples (data not
shown).

BGLU activity assay
Determination of BGLU activity was carried out according to the method of Hösel and Nahrstedt (1975)
using p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG;
ABCR, Karlsruhe, Germany) as substrate. A 10 mm stock solution of the
artificial substrate was prepared in citric acid buffer (50 mm citric
acid, 100 mm phosphate, pH 5·6). Activity assays were carried
out in 10-mL test tubes. Protein raw extracts (5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 µL)
were transferred to test tubes and adjusted to a volume of 1 mL with citric acid
buffer. Substrate stock solution (1 mL) was added. Each reaction mixture was
incubated for a defined time interval (max. 10 min) at 30 °C in a water
bath. The amount of protein raw extract used as well as the incubation time was
adapted to the extent of BGLU activity in the respective samples. When samples
revealed high enzyme activity in a first measurement the activity assay was
repeated with less protein raw extract and if necessary also shorter incubation.
Excessive pNPG decomposition, which would have caused substrate shortage and
thus underestimation of BGLU activity, was thereby avoided. Samples exhibiting
low BGLU activity were tested again using increased amounts of protein raw
extract, to obtain sufficient p-nitrophenol formation for
precise photometric analyses. This adaptation of the amounts of protein raw
extract used was necessary because the activity in the samples differed up to
50-fold (Table 1). The
reaction was stopped by transferring aliquots (500 µL) from the reaction
mixtures to new test tubes containing cooled (4 °C) sodium carbonate
solution (1 mL, 0·5 m). Subsequently, the samples were analysed
spectrophotometrically (GE Healthcare Ultrospec 3000, Uppsala, Sweden) at a
wavelength of 400 nm. All pNPG-detectable BGLU activity in rubber tree leaves is
due to one enzyme, the Hevea LIN (Selmar et al.,
1987a). Therefore, all BGLU activity measured with
this artificial substrate represents LIN activity. Table 1. Tissue damage-dependent activation of linamarase (LIN) and

Leaf tissue damage was achieved using a dissection pin.
Linamarase (LIN; or BGLU) as well as hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL)
activity was determined in the soluble protein fraction of
samples from damaged and intact leaf areas. The activity of both
enzymes increases up to ten-fold in response to tissue damage.

AF: mean of all activation factors; f. wt: fresh
weight.



To determine BGLU or LIN activity with linamarin (Sigma Aldrich) as substrate,
measurements were carried out in air-tight Thunberg vessels according to Selmar et al.
(1987a) to avoid losses of gaseous HCN. Protein
raw extract samples (2·5, 5 or 10 µL, depending on the extent of
LIN activity) were transferred to the Thunberg vessels and the volume adjusted
to 500 µL with citric acid buffer. Subsequently, 500 µL of a 10
mm linamarin stock solution was added. These reaction mixtures were
incubated for a defined time interval (max. 10 min, depending on the extent of
LIN activity) at 30 °C in a water bath, whereupon the reaction was
stopped by adding 1 mm sodium hydroxide solution (0·2
m) from the side bulb of the vessels. In addition to stopping the
reaction, sodium hydroxide causes breakdown of acetone cyanohydrin (Cooke, 1978) and leads to the
formation of non-volatile sodium cyanide. An aliquot of each reaction mixture
(100 µL) was transferred to a 20-mL test tube containing 4·8 mL
distilled water and 100 µL hydrochloric acid solution (0·1
m). Cyanide was converted to polymethine dye using a Spectroquant
Cyanide Test Kit (Merck). The polymethine concentration and hence amount of
cyanide present were determined spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 585 nm
(Ballhorn et al.,
2005).

Hydroxynitrile lyase activity assay
Hydroxynitrile lyase activity was determined according to Selmar et al.
(1987b) with acetone cyanohydrin as substrate. The
assay is based on the detection of HCN. Acetone cyanohydrin is unstable and
decomposes, especially at high pH. For this reason, the substrate stock solution
was made directly ahead of use. To prepare this solution, freshly distilled
acetone cyanohydrin was diluted 1 : 10 in citric acid solution (0·1
m). Aliquots of protein raw extract (10, 20, 50 or 100 µL)
were transferred to a test tube. The amount of protein raw extract used was
adapted to the extent of HNL activity in the respective samples. When samples
revealed high enzyme activity in a first measurement, the activity assay was
repeated with less protein raw extract. Samples exhibiting low HNL activity were
tested again using increased amounts of protein raw extract. This adaptation of
the amounts of protein raw extract used was necessary because the activity in
the samples differed up to 25-fold (Table 1). Differences in substrate availability throughout
the assay resulting in underestimation of enzyme activity were thus avoided. The
volume of each assay was adjusted to 1·98 mL using citric acid buffer (50
mm citric acid, 100 mm phosphate, pH 5·6).
Substrate stock solution (20 µL) was added and the reaction mixtures were
incubated for 5 min at 30 °C in a water bath. The reaction was stopped by
transfer of 50 µL from each reaction mixture to new 20-mL test tubes
containing 5 mL distilled water and the first component of the Spectroquant
Cyanide Test Kit. Because of the slight acidity of the solution, non-enzymatic
acetone cyanohydrin degradation is slow. Due to dissociation, HCN previously
formed in the reaction mixture remains in solution as CN−
during the incubation step following transfer to the 20-mL test tubes and during
conversion to the polymethine dye. In this manner, only HCN released due to HNL
activity is quantified. Moreover, no HCN is lost throughout conversion to the
polymethine dye (Selmar et
al., 1987b). Samples were analysed
spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 585 nm.

To exclude any losses of HCN during incubation of the reaction mixtures, also the
total amount of cyanide (HCN and acetone cyanohydrin) was determined as
described previously (BGLU activity assay). In parallel, additional trials with
the same protein raw extracts were carried out in air-tight Thunberg vessels. No
differences in total cyanide were observed between the trials in test tubes and
the trials in Thunberg vessels, confirming that no HCN was lost during
incubation of the reaction mixtures in test tubes (data not shown).

Quantification of HCN release
To quantify HCN release, protein raw extract from intact and artificially damaged
leaf tissue was incubated with a defined amount of linamarin (5 mm).
After transfer of protein raw extract (2·5, 5 or 10 µL) to test
tubes, the volume was adjusted to 1 mL using citric acid buffer (HNL activity
assay), and 1 mL linamarin stock solution (BGLU activity assay) was added. The
reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a water bath. To
stop the reaction, 20 µL from each reaction mixture were transferred into
20-mL test tubes containing 5 mL distilled water and the first component of the
Spectroquant Cyanide Test Kit. The cyanide concentration was determined as
described above (BGLU activity assay). The amount of protein raw extract used
was adapted to the extent of LIN and HNL activity in the respective samples.
This adaptation of the amounts of protein raw extract used was necessary because
HCN release in the assays differed up to four-fold (Table 2). Differences in substrate
availability throughout the assay resulting in underestimation of HCN release
were thus avoided. Table 2. Leaf tissue damage-dependent activation of LIN and HNL causes
accelerated HCN release in rubber tree

C	53	3	224	25	4-fold

Protein raw extracts from intact and damaged leaf tissue were
incubated with linamarin solution. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN)
released during the incubation was determined using the
Spectroquant Cyanide Test Kit as described by Ballhorn (2005).
HCN release is accelerated up to six-fold in response to tissue
damage. Values are means ± s.d. with n
= 3 per treatment (intact and damaged) and leaf stage (B,
C, D). Increase: increase of HCN release (quotient of mean HCN
release measured with samples from damaged tissue and samples
from intact tissue); LIN: linamarase; HNL: hydroxynitrile lyase;
f. wt: fresh weight.



To exclude any losses of HCN throughout the incubation, additional measurements
were carried out as described above for the HNL activity assay. The results
confirmed that no HCN was lost during incubation in test tubes (data not
shown).

Statistics
Ten different rubber tree seedlings were sampled throughout the experiments. For
the determination of enzyme activity as well as HCN liberation kinetics, three
individual samples were analysed per treatment (e.g. intact or damaged tissue),
leaf stage (B, C, D) and seedling (I–X). Values presented are means of
these three determinations ± s.d. The degree of the enzyme activity
increase, termed activation factor (AF), is the quotient of mean enzyme activity
in samples taken from damaged tissue and mean enzyme activity in samples taken
from intact tissue.

RESULTS
LIN and HNL activities in damaged and intact leaf tissue
BGLU activities ranging from 0·23 µkat g−1 f. wt
(B stage, seedling II) to 1·33 µkat g −1 f. wt
(D, V) were measured with intact leaf tissue (Table 1). In contrast, samples from highly
damaged areas (Materials and Methods) of the same leaflets exhibited BGLU
activities of 3·1 µkat g−1 f. wt (B, II) and
8·8 µkat g−1 f. wt (D, V). This corresponds to a
14-fold increase in activity for B II and a seven-fold increase for D V,
respectively. Similar results were obtained for all other samplings. On average,
BGLU activity was eight times higher in damaged than in intact tissues
(Table 1).
Corresponding incubations with linamarin found that breakdown of this cyanogenic
glucoside is accelerated to the same degree in response to tissue damage (data
not shown).

Analogous findings resulted from determination of HNL. Intact tissues of B VI and
D VIII had HNL activities of 1·8 and 1·3 µkat g
−1 f. wt, respectively (Table 1), compared with values of
4·3 and 8·8 µkat g −1 f. wt,
respectively, observed for highly damaged leaf areas, corresponding to a
2·4- (B VI) and 6·6-fold (D VIII) increase. Similar results were
obtained for all other samplings. On average, HNL activity was four times higher
in damaged than in intact tissue (Table 1). This activity increase will subsequently be
termed LIN and HNL activation. Its extent will be given as activation factor
(AF).

To analyse the impact of the degree or severity of tissue damage on LIN and HNL
activation, additional samples with distinct differences in the extent of damage
were prepared and examined (Materials and Methods). Whereas a mean AF for LIN of
5–6 and for HNL of 4–5 was noted in highly damaged tissues, the
corresponding activation was only two-fold for either enzyme when the leaves had
been only slightly damaged (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1. (A) Activation of LIN and HNL in differentially damaged rubber
tree leaf tissue. (B) Activation of LIN and HNL in the proximity of
damaged rubber tree leaf tissue. Leaf tissue damage was achieved
using a dissection pin. Linamarase (LIN; or BGLU) as well as
hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) activity was determined in the soluble
protein fraction of samples from damaged and intact leaf areas as
well as leaf areas adjacent to damaged tissue. With increasing
degree of tissue damage also the extent of LIN and HNL activation
increased (A). In the proximity of damaged tissue neither LIN nor
HNL activation could be observed (B). Values given in the figure are
means ± s.d. (error bars) with n = 3
per treatment (intact, slightly damaged, highly damaged, adjacent to
damage 1 and 2) and sampling (1 and 2, colour coded). Different
rubber tree seedlings were used in each sampling. Samples adjacent
to damage were taken on two sides of the treated leaf area (adjacent
to damage 1 and 2). Activation factor is the quotient of mean enzyme
activity in samples taken from differentially damaged tissue or
tissue adjacent to damaged areas and mean enzyme activity in samples
taken from intact tissue. Adjacent to damage: samples taken from
tissue adjacent to damaged leaf areas.



To determine the spatial extent of the impact of tissue damage on LIN and HNL
activation, samples from leaf tissue adjacent to the mechanically damaged areas
were tested as described above. Although there was a broad activation of LIN
(seven- to ten-fold) and of HNL (five-fold) in the highly damaged areas, no
changes in enzyme activity compared with control areas occurred in leaf tissue
next to the injuries (Fig. 1B).

Kinetics of LIN and HNL activation
To analyse the velocity of LIN and HNL activation, corresponding samples were
taken from leaf tissue 30 s, 5 min and 10 min after tissue damage. In the
samples taken after 30 s, LIN activation factors of 4·8 (sampling I) and
8·7 (II) were measured (Fig. 2). In samples taken 5 and 10 min after tissue damage no further LIN
activity increase was observed, with AFs of 4·5 (I) and 5·6 (II)
in the 5-min samples and 5·0 (I) and 3·9 (II) in the 10-min
samples. Fig. 2. Kinetics of tissue damage-dependent LIN and HNL activation in
rubber tree leaves. Leaf tissue damage was achieved using a
dissection pin. Samples from damaged leaf areas were taken 30 s, 5
min and 10 min after tissue damage. Intact tissue served as
zero-point sample. Linamarase (LIN; or BGLU) as well as
hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) activity was determined in the soluble
protein fraction of the samples. The activation of both enzymes is
completed within less than 30 s after tissue damage occurs. Values
given in the figure are means ± s.d. with n
= 3 per treatment (intact, damaged 30 s, damaged 5 min,
damaged 10 min) and sampling or repetition (grey scale code).
Different rubber tree seedlings were used in sampling I and II or
III and IV. Activation factor is the quotient of mean enzyme
activity in samples taken from tissue 0·5, 5 and 10 min after
damage and average enzyme activity in samples taken from intact
tissue.



Analogous results were obtained for HNL activation. In the samples taken 30 s
after tissue damage, AFs of 8·1 (III) and 5·5 (IV) were found
(Fig. 2), but, for the 5-
and 10-min samples, constant or decreasing activities were observed. AF values
of 7·6 (III) and 2·7 (IV) were found for instance regarding the
10-min samplings.

Activation of LIN and HNL is completed within 30 s after tissue damage
occurs.

Impact of LIN and HNL activation on HCN liberation kinetics
To verify the impact of LIN and HNL activation on HCNc, protein raw extracts of
samples from intact and highly damaged leaf tissues were incubated with
linamarin solution and cyanide release was monitored over 10 min. With samples
taken from intact stage B leaf tissue, an HCN release rate of 49 µmol (g
f. wt)−1 min−1 was observed, but with
protein raw extract from damaged tissue, cyanide release rate was 109
µmol (g f. wt)−1 min−1
(Table 2). Thus, HCN
formation is twice as fast. Similarly, incubation with protein raw extract from
intact stage C leaves caused formation of 53 µmol HCN
g−1 (g f. wt)−1 min−1,

corresponding to a four-fold increase. In the case of intact stage D leaf
samples, 34 µmol HCN (g f. wt)−1
min−1 was detected, but protein raw extract from highly
damaged tissue accelerated the release six-fold to 216 µmol HCN (g f.

DISCUSSION
LIN and HNL activation – immediate modulation of the cyanogenic
response
Regulation of the amount of CG (HCNp) and BGLU activity at either genetic (e.g.
T. repens) or transcriptional (e.g. S.
bicolor and P. lunatus) level allows a
modification or modulation of HCNc from one to the next generation and within
days or hours, respectively (Hughes,
1981; Busk and Møller,
2002). Moreover, both types of regulation, genetic as well as
transcriptional, often affect the cyanogenic characteristics (HCNp and HCNc) of
the whole plant or plant organs. However, in H. brasiliensis
leaves, LIN and HNL activity increases within seconds in response to tissue
damage, but the activation response does not spread from the point of injury.
LIN and HNL are activated only in leaf areas directly affected by the damage.
Moreover, the enhanced activity of either enzyme is related to the severity or
type of tissue damage. Extensive damage causes higher activation than minor
injuries. In contrast to genetic and transcriptional regulations previously
described, activation of LIN and HNL produces immediate, local and damage
type-dependent modulation of HCNc.

The rate of activation indicates that the effect is probably induced by
post-translational enzyme modification. Protein nitrosylation in animals is
known to serve as a rapid mediator of enzyme activation (Murad, 1986). Nitric oxide (NO)-dependent
S-nitrosylation has been reported to occur also in plant tissue (Lindermayr et al.,
2005). In leaves of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum),
NO is synthesized in response to tissue damage (Huang et al., 2004). Whether the
observed activation of LIN and HNL in H. brasiliensis leaf
tissue is related to NO-induced S-nitrosylation will be a topic for future
research.

In addition to synthesis of NO, tissue damage also results in the formation of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Besides its function in the
signal transduction chain leading to phytoalexin synthesis (reviewed by Buchanan et al.,
2002), H2O2 may oxidize cystein residues
facilitating enzyme activity modifications similar to the NO-related modulations
(Romero-Puertas et
al., 2004; Lamotte
et al., 2005).

Activation mechanisms – post-translational regulation of BGLU activity
in other plants
The BGLU PYK10 from root tissue of Arabidopsis thaliana is
stored in so-called ER bodies as an inactive monomer. When PYK10 comes into
contact with cytoplasmic PBP1 (PYK Binding Protein 1) upon homogenization,
cross-linking of the monomers results in polymerization. The PYK10 (PBP1)
polymers are insoluble but are catalytically active (Nagano et al., 2005). A similar
mechanism might occur in H. brasiliensis and lead to the
activation of LIN as this enzyme tends to form oligomers of variable size
(2–26 identical subunits) on native polyacrylamide gels (Selmar et al.,
1987a). Nevertheless, incubation of H.
brasiliensis leaf homogenates at room temperature did not result in
enhanced LIN activity comparable with the activation effect caused by tissue
damage (data not shown).

BGLU from leaf tissue of Triticum aestivum forms hexamers and
lower order oligomers; only the hexamers are catalytically active (Sue et al., 2006).
The same effect might account for the activity of LIN from H.
brasiliensis, but to date studying the catalytic activity of
specific oligomers has not been conducted mainly because of their unstable
state. Once oligomers are separated electrophoretically, each oligomer-type
regenerates all oligomer-types (Selmar
et al., 1987a). Stabilization
of oligomer-types will be necessary for future study of the catalytic activity
of these enzymes.

Interestingly, LIN from cassava (also a member of Euphorbiaceae) also forms
oligomers (Sermsuvityawong, 1995).
The oligomer patterns are highly similar to those reported for rubber tree LIN
by Selmar et al.
(1987a). Preliminary results on LIN activity in
cassava leaf tissue indicate that the enzyme also is activated in response to
mechanical tissue damage. Corresponding samples from three individual plants
found that the activity increased two- to 30-fold (D. Kadow et
al., unpubl. res.). These results point to a relationship between
LIN oligomer formation and the LIN activation reported here.

LIN and HNL activation – biochemical and ecological
implications
All components needed for cyanogenesis, i.e. CGs and their degrading enzymes, are
preformed. While herbivore attack occurs within seconds, modifications of CG
level and BGLU activity by mechanisms described so far (i.e. genetic and
transcriptional) are not achieved faster than within days or hours. Cyanogenic
capacity (HCNc), apart from herbivore impact, thus depends on the preformed
components. Accordingly, the defence reaction has to be regarded as static. The
immediate up-regulation of HCNc by activation of LIN and HNL makes this static
defence reaction a dynamic response and might allow flexible reactions to
multiple antagonists such as herbivores and fungal pathogens (Fig 3). In this context, cyanogenesis has
been discussed controversially for some time (reviewed by Møller, 2010), because it may act as a
resistance- and susceptibility-factor at the same time (Lieberei, 2007; Ballhorn et al., 2010a; Ballhorn, 2011). The interaction of
H. brasiliensis with Microcyclus ulei, the
fungal agent causing South American Leaf Blight (SALB), demonstrates how
problematic the role of cyanogenesis in plant defence can be. Leaves of the
rubber tree clone F4542, which is partially resistant to SALB, are weakly
cyanogenic, but accumulate up to 3·2 µg scopoletin per gram of
leaf dry weight (d. wt) upon inoculation with M. ulei.
Scopoletin, a coumarin-derived phytoalexin, inhibits fungal spore germination as
well as hyphal growth (Giesemann
et al., 1986). By contrast, the strongly
cyanogenic clone RRIM600, which is susceptible to SALB, accumulates only
0·5 µg (g d. wt)−1 of scopoletin upon
inoculation (Lieberei et
al., 1989). However, when HCN – released in
response to tissue damage caused by M. ulei – is
efficiently removed from the atmosphere surrounding the leaves, RRIM600 leaf
tissue accumulates scopoletin to an amount equal to that determined for F4542.
Thus, in contrast to plant–herbivore interactions, low cyanogenic
capacity is critical for the partial resistance of rubber tree to M.
ulei. Similar findings have been reported for lima bean. Genotypes
with high HCNc and efficient herbivore repellence are susceptible to fungal
attack due to the HCN-mediated inhibition of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), a key
enzyme in lima bean defence against fungal pathogens. In contrast, LC genotypes
in which PPO is not inhibited show resistance to fungal pathogens, but are
susceptible to herbivores (Ballhorn
et al., 2010a; Ballhorn, 2011). Cyanogenic plant
species may adapt to this by evolving HC as well as LC genotypes as observed for
example in white clover and lima bean (Hughes, 1981; Ballhorn,
2011). However, the individual plant can only be herbivore- or
pathogen-resistant (static defence reaction). Post-translational regulation of
the activity of LIN and HNL may allow plants to combine both properties, high
and low HCNc, avoiding ecological costs (dynamic defence reaction). Chewing
herbivores that cause major tissue damage may induce strong activation and
immediate up-regulation of the HCN release resulting in repellence
(Fig. 3). In contrast, no
up-regulation may occur in the case of minor damage, e.g. injury caused by
initial stages of fungal growth. The small amounts of HCN released possibly
would not affect the fungus, but also may not impair alternative plant defence
mechanisms, such as phytoalexin biosynthesis (Fig. 3). However, to date no rubber tree clones fully
resistant to M. ulei have been described and data on cyanogenic
plants resistant to both herbivores and HCN-resistant pathogenic fungi are
lacking. Whether LIN and HNL activation provides such a multiple tolerance or
resistance will be the focus of future research. Fig.
3. Ecological implications of immediate up-regulation of cyanogenic
capacity (HCNc). In many cyanogenic plant species, HCNc (Lieberei, 1988) is
regulated at genetic and transcriptional level. In these cases, an
immediate modulation of HCNc (low HCNc to high HCNc and vice versa)
as a result of herbivore or fungal attack is impossible. Therefore,
the individual plant can only be herbivore- or pathogenic
fungus-resistant (static defence reaction). In contrast, the
activation of linamarase (LIN) and hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL)
reported here results in immediate up-regulation of HCNc in response
to severe, but not to minor, tissue damage (dynamic defence
response). This may allow the combination of both properties (low
and high HCNc) and might enable resistance to herbivores as well as
to fungal pathogens. However, to date no data on cyanogenic plants
resistant to both herbivores and HCN-resistant pathogenic fungi have
been published. Pictures of leaf discs by: R. Lieberei and V.

LIN from H. brasiliensis leaf tissue has low substrate
specificity. In addition to linamarin this enzyme also decomposes prunasin,
dhurrin, coniferin as well as artificial mono-galactosides, mannosides and
xylosides (Selmar et al.,
1987a). It seems possible that under in
vivo conditions substrates other than linamarin may be accepted.
For instance, many phytohormones, such as abscisic acid (ABA), are inactivated
by glycosylation. In Hordeum vulgare leaves, salt stress causes
increased BGLU activity in the apoplast (Dietz et al., 2000) and the subsequently enhanced
deglucosylation of ABA glucoside results in reduced stomatal opening. LIN from
H. brasiliensis also is located in the apoplasmic space
(Selmar, 1986; Gruhnert et al.,
1994). If the enzyme is able to deglucosylate ABA glucoside, high
levels of activity, indispensable for successful herbivore repellence, would
disturb the regulation of stomatal opening, by generating increased amounts of
ABA and causing constant stomata closure. Activation of LIN occurring only in
response to tissue damage may limit such interferences in intact leaves, but
would guarantee at the same time a release of HCN at a rate sufficient to repel
herbivores.

In all experiments presented here, tissue damage was achieved mechanically using
a dissection pin. Such damage must not necessarily have the same effect as
damage caused by herbivores. For example, herbivore attack may result in various
types of damage due to differences in feeding styles. Beetles having small
mandibles chew the leaf tissue, whilst locust nymphs with relatively large
mandibles rather ‘cut’ entire pieces (Ballhorn et al.,
2010b). Moreover, insect saliva regularly contains
enzymes (e.g. β-glucosidases), inhibitors and elicitors (Mattiaci et al.,
1995; Miles, 1999; Zhu-Salzman et al.,
2005; Alborn et
al., 2007; Harmel
et al., 2008; Ballhorn et al.,
2010b) potentially affecting the kinetics of HCN
release. Increased BGLU activity resulting in accelerated cyanide release has
been reported for lima bean 72 h after onset of herbivore attack. In contrast,
mechanical damage of the leaves did not result in enhanced enzyme activity
(Ballhorn et al.,
2006). The authors link this to the presence of elicitors in the
insect saliva. However, our results clearly show that in rubber tree leaves LIN
and HNL are activated within seconds as a reaction to mechanical tissue
damage.

Damage-dependent LIN activation in other cyanogenic plants
As noted above, in lima bean leaves mechanical tissue damage does not result in
BGLU activation (Ballhorn et
al., 2006). Similar observations have been made in other
cyanogenic plants. Preliminary results suggest that neither in flax
(Linum usitatissimum) nor in white clover is LIN activation
comparable to that described here for rubber tree. In contrast, cassava leaves
revealed up to 30-fold increased LIN activity in response to tissue damage (D.
Kadow et al., unpubl. res.). Cassava is the agronomically most
important of the cyanogenic crops (Siritunga et al., 2004). It is the major source of
calories for people living in sub-Saharan Africa (McMahon et al., 1995). Insufficient
removal of CGs from the tubers prior to consumption may result in acute or
chronic cyanide exposure causing health disorders such as Konzo, a paralytic
disorder (acute exposure), or tropical ataxic neuropathy (chronic exposure;
Siritunga and Sayre, 2004).
Processing of cassava tubers regularly involves enzymatic degradation of
linamarin and lotaustralin (Siritunga and
Sayre, 2004). If LIN activation were to occur also in the root
tissue, this might help to accelerate and thereby optimize the detoxification of
cassava tubers. However, Tylleskaer
et al. (1992) report that acetone cyanohydrin
rather than linamarin is the major source of cyanide in poorly processed
cassava.

The cyanogenic status of plants – a complex interaction of multiple
factors
Besides genotypic variability and the biotic factors mentioned above, several
abiotic factors with influence on plant cyanogenesis have been described. Hughes (1981) reports that leaves of
white clover grown at low temperature (19 °C) contain about 50 %
more CG than corresponding control plants (grown at 27 °C). Stochmal and Oleszek (1997) observed
seasonal changes in HCNp of eight white clover cultivars correlating with mean
air temperature. In all cultivars the highest amounts of CG were measured when
the air temperature was below 15 °C. With increasing temperature during
summer HCNp decreased drastically (Stochmal and Oleszek, 1997). However, when cultivating white clover
at a night-time temperature of only 5 °C (15 °C during daytime),
Hayden and Parker (2002) found
that HCNp decreased in comparison to plants grown at 25/15 °C
(day/night). In flax seedlings, CG level increases with increasing temperature
(Niedźwiedź-Siegień and Gierasimiuk, 2001). The
authors observed highest HCNp in plants grown at 30 °C. Moreover, the
light intensity seems to play a key role in the regulation of CG biosynthesis in
flax. Shoots of plants exposed to increased light intensities contained up to
twice the amount of CG detected in control plants (Trione, 1960; Hughes, 1981; Niedźwiedź-Siegień and Gierasimiuk, 2001). Such
modifications of HCNp may be due to altered allocation of nitrogen to CG
biosynthesis (e.g. Burns et
al., 2002). In contrast, Kongsawadworakul et al. (2009)
report that in rubber tree leaves HCNp decreases within hours upon exposure to
sunlight. Another important abiotic factor is nitrogen availability. In
5-week-old sorghum plants the application of nitrogen fertilizer caused a
pronounced increase in CG content. HCNp of the whole plant was increased by a
factor of 7 (Busk and Møller,
2002).

In addition, changes of HCNp have been observed frequently during the course of
maturation. While young leaves of lima bean may accumulate huge amounts of CG,
HCNp is significantly lower in fully developed leaves (Ballhorn et al., 2005). Similar
observations have been made with rubber tree. Immature leaves (stage B and C)
have a higher HCNp than stage D (mature) leaves (Kongsawadworakul et al., 2009).

Moreover, CGs not only function as phytoanticipins but also serve the plant as
transporters of nitrogen and glucose (reviewed by Møller, 2010). Rubber tree seeds, for
instance, store large amounts of linamarin in the endosperm. Upon germination
linamarin is converted to the diglucoside linustatin which is then transported
to the seedling where HCN is assimilated into asparagine and aspartic acid
(Selmar et al.,
1988; summarized by Møller, 2010). Similarly, in cassava linamarin synthesized in
the leaves is transported to the roots where it is proposed to be the major
source of reduced nitrogen for protein biosynthesis (Siritunga and Sayre, 2004). Kongsawadworakul et al. (2009) have
suggested that CGs in rubber tree also are a source of nitrogen and glucose in
latex production.

The endogenous turnover of CGs may have a key role in the cyanogenic status of
the plant as well. In sorghum, a significant turnover of dhurrin even in
seedlings has been reported (Adewusi,
1990). Jenrich et
al. (2007) suggest a turnover pathway that does not
include any cyanohydrin or HCN formation. The authors found that in the course
of dhurrin degradation, 4-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile is accumulated and may
subsequently be converted to ammonia and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (Jenrich et al.,
2007; Møller,
2010).

Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the cyanogenic status of a plant
is determined by a complex interaction of multiple factors. The regulatory
background of many of the underlying immanent plant processes remains
unknown.

Conclusions
Our study shows that the activity of the key enzymes for cyanogenesis – in
addition to the genetic and transcriptional control reported previously –
can also be regulated at the post-translational level. In rubber tree
(H. brasiliensis), LIN and HNL are activated within seconds
in response to mechanical tissue damage. In directly affected leaf areas the
activity of the two enzymes increases up to ten-fold, depending on the severity
or type of tissue damage. This allows an immediate and local modulation of HCNc.
Accordingly, LIN and HNL activation may enable more flexible reactions to
multiple antagonists such as herbivores and fungal pathogens.
