Presence of coconuts in Panama pre-Columbus (Viewpoint)
doi:10.1093/aob/mct244


 A long-standing debate about the existence of coconut in Panama in pre-Columbian times has recently been revived and its presence, as well as the ability of the first Spanish explorers to correctly identify coconut, has been questioned. Baudouin et al. (pp. 1–5) consult original sources and confirm that the Spanish chronicler Oviedo (1478–1557) effectively distinguished coconuts from other similar palm fruits based on their sizes. A drawing attributed to Oviedo that has been argued as being an inaccurate depiction of coconut is shown actually to be a representation of a cluster of fruits of a native Bactris, with the mis-identification only occurring after Oviedo's death. In addition, Mártir de Anglería (1457–1526) is shown to have described tidal seed dispersion of coconut at a site in Panama.

Microbes improve plant iron acquisition (Review)
doi:10.1093/aob/mct249


 Microbial activity plays a critical role in acquisition of iron (Fe) by plants from soils in which it is deficient, but the mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. In this review, Jin et al. (pp. 7–18) consider that root exudates induced by Fe deficiency alter the microbial community in the rhizosphere by modifying the physicochemical properties of soil, and/or by their antimicrobial and/or growth-promoting effects. The altered microbial community may in turn benefit plant Fe acquisition via production of siderophores and protons, both of which improve Fe bioavailability in soil, and via generation of hormones that trigger the enhancement of the plant's Fe uptake capacity. Mechanisms relating to rhizobium nodulation and mycorrhizal fungi infection are also reviewed.

Regulation of root morphogenesis in arbuscular mycorrhizae (Review)
doi:10.1093/aob/mct258


 Increased root branching is recognized as a general feature of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) roots, but a full understanding of the mechanisms involved is still lacking. Fusconi (pp. 19–33) reviews the subject and concludes that fungal exudates are probably the main compounds regulating AM root morphogenesis during the first colonization steps, while a complex network of interactions governs root development in established AMs. The possible involvements of phosphate, which generally increases in AM plants, and of variations in sugar transport and in hormone homeostasis, signalling and interactions are also discussed.

Morphological evolution of eupolypod II ferns
doi:10.1093/aob/mct247


 Patterns of evolution of fern morphology have long puzzled biologists. Sundue and Rothfels (pp. 35–54) analyse the morphological evolution in the eupolypod II ferns, a clade that comprises approximately a third of extant fern species. Their results indicate that the historic difficulties in classifying these ferns have been due to a combination of evolutionary stasis, with disparate groups appearing to be closely related due to shared ancestral morphologies, and evolutionary convergence, with the repeated evolution of similar features. They find a general congruence of morphological and molecular data and present a revised understanding of sorus evolution. In addition, a chromosome base number of x = 41 is determined to be ancestral for eupolypods, with the eupolypods II characterized by subsequent repeated genome size reductions.

Phylogeography of a coastal tree species
doi:10.1093/aob/mct253


 Few phylogeographic studies have been undertaken for species confined to narrow, linear coastal systems where past sea-level and geomorphological changes may have had a profound effect on population sizes and distributions. Nevill et al. (pp. 55–67) conduct a phylogeographic analysis of Eucalyptus gomphocephala (tuart), a tree species restricted to a 400 × 10-km band of coastal sand-plain in south-west Australia. Genetic data suggest wide persistence of the species during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and palaeo-distribution modelling gives strong evidence for occurrence of E. gomphocephala westward of the current coastline during the LGM. The study highlights the importance of the inclusion of complementary, non-genetic data (information on geomorphology and palaeoclimate) to interpret phylogeographic patterns.

Carnivory and photosynthesis in sundew
doi:10.1093/aob/mct254


 Carnivorous plants grow in nutrient-poor habitats and obtain a substantial amount of nutrients from prey. Pavlovič et al. (pp. 69–78) examine the full capture cycle of the carnivorous sundew Drosera capensis, including prey attraction, digestion and the subsequent benefits from nutrient uptake. They find that the red colour of the tentacles is not attractive for insect prey, and that mechanical stimulation alone of tentacles is not sufficient to induce full enzymatic activity. The uptake of phosphorus from prey is more efficient than that of nitrogen and causes the foliar N:P ratio to decrease. Stoichiometric relationships among different nutrients indicate that the growth of unfed D. capensis plants is P-limited, and this limitation is markedly alleviated by feeding on fruit flies, resulting in an improved plant nutrient status and photosynthetic performance.

Adaptive and neutral variation in Psilopeganum sinense
doi:10.1093/aob/mct255


 Natural selection and genetic drift are important evolutionary forces in determining genetic and phenotypic differentiation in plant populations. Ye et al. (pp. 79–86) study population differentiation at five quantitative traits (QST) in Psilopeganum sinense (Rutaceae), an endangered species with fragmented distribution and small population sizes, and compare this with differentiation at putatively neutral microsatellite markers (FST). The results show that QST ≤ FST and thus provide no evidence of local adaptation in well-differentiated populations at a relatively large spatial scale, and instead suggest a role of stabilizing selection and drift leading to phenotypic differentiation among small populations.

Production of peroxynitrite in arabidopsis peroxisomes
doi:10.1093/aob/mct260


 Peroxisomes are subcellular compartments involved in multiple cellular metabolic pathways. Corpas and Barroso (pp. 87–96) use fluorescent probes to study transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana and show that under conditions of no stress peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a nitric oxide-derived molecule that causes nitration of proteins, is clearly localized in the peroxisomes of roots and stomatal guard cells. They demonstrate that cadmium causes a general increase in the production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide with a concomitant generation of peroxynitrite, suggesting that peroxisomes participate in the nitro-oxidative stress response against cadmium.

Movement herkogamy versus pollination accuracy
doi:10.1093/aob/mct261


 Spatial separation of pollen presentation and stigma receptivity (herkogamy) can reduce sexual interference in hermaphrodite flowers, but may lead to a potential conflict via reduced pollination accuracy. Armbruster et al. (pp. 97–103) investigate Parnassia epunctulata, a herb with generalized pollination, which exhibits sequential stamen movement. Usually one newly dehisced anther is positioned each day over the central gynoecium, while the older stamens bend away from the central position. The results show that this staggered pollen presentation and subsequent stigma presentation in the same place reduces sexual interference and improves pollination accuracy, as shown by adaptive accuracy analysis of the three male and female flower phases. Thus a combination of movement herkogamy and dichogamy can maintain high pollination accuracy in flowers with generalized pollination.

Ontogenetic tissue modification of fruit peduncles
doi:10.1093/aob/mct262


 Fruit peduncles of apple (Malus) are modified stems that connect fruits to branches whilst withstanding the increasing weight of the fruit. Horbens et al. (pp. 105–118) combine anatomical and biomechanical studies to show that, unlike in regular stems, the vascular cambium produces mainly phloem during secondary growth, and a centrally arranged sclerenchyma ring develops composed of fibres and brachysclereids. The fibres provide an increased maximum tensile strength and contribute the most to the overall axial rigidity of the peduncles. Sclereids contribute insignificantly to the peduncle strength but, despite being shown to have a lower elastic modulus compared to that of fibres, they are found to be the most effective tissue in stiffening peduncles against bending.

Plastid genomes and relationships in Zingiberales
doi:10.1093/aob/mct264


 The tropical angiosperm order Zingiberales comprises a diverse clade of eight families, containing economically and ecologically important species, but deep phylogenetic relationships within them are poorly understood. Barrett et al. (pp. 119–133) use next-generation sequencing to generate complete plastid gene sets and find that plastid genomes provide strong support for many relationships, but only weak support for Heliconiaceae as sister to the rest of the order. Moreover, manipulation of various data matrix properties affects tree topology in an unpredictable fashion, suggesting that complete coding regions of the plastome do not provide sufficient character information to resolve this rapid, ancient radiation.

Campanulaceae seeds require light to germinate
doi:10.1093/aob/mct250


 Small seeds are a common trait in the large, cosmopolitan family Campanulaceae. Koutsovoulou et al. (pp. 135–143) investigate the effect of light on germination in 131 taxa from all five continents of its distribution and find that light-promoted germination constitutes a collective characteristic of the Campanulaceae, regardless of habitat type, life form and climatic conditions. Across species, the light requirement decreases significantly with increasing seed mass, and for larger-seeded species germination in the dark reaches higher levels under alternating than under constant temperatures. It is thus suggested that smaller-seeded taxa might germinate only on the soil surface or at shallow depths while larger-seeded species might additionally germinate when buried in the soil if cued to do so by fluctuating temperatures.

Shoot development in alfalfa plants competing for light
doi:10.1093/aob/mct251


 The growth of crops in mixtures is more difficult to predict than in pure stands, with light partitioning and leaf area expansion accounting for a lot of the variability observed. Baldissera et al. (pp. 145–157) study light modulation of leaf area expansion in alfalfa, Medicago sativa, in isolated plants and under different light regimes produced by a range of canopies in pure and mixed stands. They find that changes in plant development explain most of the variations in plant leaf area, with average leaf size contributing to a lesser extent. Branch development and the number of shoots per plant are the leaf area components most affected by light availability, with primary axis development and plant demography only being affected under severe light competition.

Genetic diversity and mating system of autopolyploid Vicia
doi:10.1093/aob/mct252



Vicia cracca (vetch, Fabaceae) is a perennial herb with a contact zone of diploids and tetraploids in Central Europe. Eliášová et al. (pp. 159–170) study genetic diversity, heterozygosity and mating systems and confirm the autopolyploid origin of V. cracca tetraploids, which have higher allelic richness compared with diploids. A pollination experiment suggests that the breeding system in both cytotypes is mixed-mating with prevailing outcrossing, but that polyploids tolerate a higher rate of autogamy. The results support the hypothesis that polyploids may be better colonizers because they possess higher genetic diversity, and thus the ability to adapt to changing conditions, and also have lower inbreeding depression.

Seed dormancy cycling in a halophytic shrub
doi:10.1093/aob/mct256


 Soil seed banks and dormancy cycling have been well studied in annuals, but less is known about woody plants. Cao et al. (pp. 171–179) investigate the cold desert shrub Kalidium gracile (Amaranthaceae) and find that it has three life history traits that help ensure persistence at a site: a polycarpic perennial life cycle, a persistent seed bank and dormancy cycling. Buried seeds exhibit an annual non-dormancy/conditional dormancy cycle, and germination varies in sensitivity to salinity during the cycle. Dormancy cycling is co-ordinated with seasonal environmental conditions in such a way that the seeds germinate in summer, when there is sufficient precipitation for seedling establishment.

Root cortical aerenchyma inhibits radial nutrient transport
doi:10.1093/aob/mct259


 Root cortical aerenchyma (RCA) provides an adaptation to low nutrient availability by reducing the metabolic cost of soil exploration. Hu et al. (pp. 181–189) use radiolabelling to investigate uptake of phosphate, sulphate and calcium in roots of maize (Zea mays) differing in their degree of RCA formation. They find that in each of the three genotypes studied the rate of phosphate exudation of high-RCA genotypes is significantly less than that of low-RCA genotypes, and that radial nutrient transport of phosphate and calcium is negatively correlated with the extent of RCA for some of the genotypes. The results support the hypothesis that RCA can reduce radial transport of some nutrients in some genotypes, which could be an important trade-off against the reduced cost of root production.

Flow cytometric analysis of bee pollen loads
doi:10.1093/aob/mct257


 Understanding the species composition of pollen on pollinators has applications in agriculture, conservation and evolutionary biology, but current identification methods cannot always discriminate taxa at the species level. Kron et al. (pp. 191–197) test the use of flow cytometry to characterize pollen loads from individual bees, using DNA content as a species marker, and find that they are able to quickly measure DNA contents for nuclei from hundreds to thousands of pollen grains per bee. They observe differences in pollen load diversity between bumble-bees and honey-bees and find evidence of between-cytotype pollinator movement in a population of Solidago. This technique provides a new tool to complement other methods for examining pollinator behaviour.
