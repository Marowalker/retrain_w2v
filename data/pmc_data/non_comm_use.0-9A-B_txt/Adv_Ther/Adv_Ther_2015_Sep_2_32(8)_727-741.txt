The long-term goal of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment is improvement of liver
disease and prevention of cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to assess whether prolonged
telbivudine treatment improves liver inflammation and fibrosis. The primary objective was to
evaluate the proportion of patients with absence/minimal inflammation (Knodell necroinflammatory
score ≤3) on liver biopsy at Year 5.

Methods
Fifty-seven patients aged 16–70 years with a clinical history of CHB and active
viral replication (38 hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg] positive and 19 HBeAg negative) were followed
for 6 years: 33 received telbivudine 600 mg/day continuously for 5 years; 24 received lamivudine
100 mg/day for 2 years and then telbivudine for 3 years. Liver biopsies were taken pre-treatment and
after 5 years of treatment.

Results
At baseline, mean (standard deviation) serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA load was
8.5 (1.7) log10 copies/mL, Knodell necroinflammatory score was 7.6 (2.9), and
Ishak fibrosis score was 2.2 (1.1). After antiviral treatment (median duration: 261 weeks), liver
histology improved with increased proportions of patients with absence/minimal liver inflammation
(Knodell necroinflammatory score ≤3), from 16% (9/57) at baseline to 98% (56/57), and
absence/minimal fibrosis (Ishak score ≤1), from 25% (14/57) at baseline to 84% (48/57). At Year 5,
HBV DNA load was <300 copies/mL for all patients; cumulative HBeAg loss and seroconversion rates
were 88% and 77%, respectively. At Year 6, 95% of patients with abnormal baseline glomerular
filtration rate (60–90 mL/min/1.73 m2) improved to normal GFR
(>90 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Conclusion
Long-term telbivudine treatment with profound and durable viral suppression
significantly improved liver histology, thus achieving the long-term goals of CHB treatment.
FibroScan® results after 5 and 6 years of treatment (in almost 20% of
patients) were consistent with this information.

Introduction
More than 240 million individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) worldwide. The prevalence of hepatitis B is high in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia, where it
exceeds >8%. About 80–90% of patients in the Asia–pacific region became infected with HBV during
childhood, and 5–10% of the adult population is chronically infected. It is estimated that about
600,000 deaths occur each year due to acute or chronic hepatitis B (CHB) [1]. Between 15% and 20% of patients with chronic HBV replication will
develop cirrhosis within 5 years [2, 3]. The REVEAL study demonstrated that progression to cirrhosis in
hepatitis B-infected persons is strongly correlated with levels of HBV replication and serum HBV DNA
level, with a DNA load ≥10,000 copies/mL a strong risk predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma
[4, 5].
Moreover, increased serum HBV DNA levels also increased the mortality risk for all causes or causes
related to chronic liver disease [6]. Several other
studies have also correlated serum HBV DNA concentrations with the progression of chronic liver
disease [7–10].

Viral replication is now recognized as the key driver of liver injury, and
international guidelines recommend that permanent suppression of HBV replication is the primary aim
of CHB treatment [1, 11, 12]. The ultimate goal of antiviral
therapy is to improve survival by preventing liver disease progression to cirrhosis, liver failure,
and hepatocellular carcinoma [12]. Liver fibrosis is a
tissue-repair response that involves a range of cell types including mediators to encapsulate injury
[13]. Although previously considered irreversible,
recent studies indicate that profound and durable viral suppression is associated with the
regression of liver fibrosis, which improves clinical outcomes in patients with CHB or chronic
hepatitis C [14–16].

Telbivudine provides effective treatment in CHB patients, as shown in randomized,
double blind, multicenter phase 3 trials. The 2-year GLOBE study demonstrated the superiority of
telbivudine 600 mg/day over lamivudine 100 mg/day with greater HBV DNA suppression and less
genotypic resistance [17, 18]. Study 015, with a similar design to the GLOBE study, was
conducted entirely in China and also showed greater antiviral and clinical efficacy responses for
telbivudine, with less resistance, when compared with lamivudine after 2 years of treatment
[19]. Telbivudine-treated hepatitis B e antigen
(HBeAg)-positive patients achieved a higher cumulative seroconversion rate, suggesting long-lasting
benefits of telbivudine treatment [20].

Long-term treatment with oral antiviral agents, such as lamivudine, adefovir,
entecavir, and tenofovir slows the clinical and histologic progression of CHB in patients with
advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis [14, 21–25]. However, no
information is available on liver histology after long-term treatment with telbivudine. This study
evaluated the impact of telbivudine treatment on liver inflammation and fibrosis in CHB patients
after 5 years.

Methods
Study Design
The study cohort consisted of patients who completed 2 years of telbivudine or
lamivudine treatment in the phase 3 GLOBE or 015 studies, and subsequently continued with
telbivudine for an additional 4 years (study CN04E1, ClinicalTrials.gov # NCT00877149). Liver
biopsies were taken at baseline in the phase 3 studies and after 5 years of antiviral treatment
(Fig. 1). The study was approved by each local independent
ethics committee. Institutional Review Board and all procedures followed were in accordance with the
ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national)
and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 and 2008. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient.Fig. 1 Patient flow diagram



Studies were registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT00057265 (GLOBE
study), NCT00131742 (study 015), NCT00142298 (study 2303), and NCT00646503 (study CN04).

Study Population
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria in GLOBE/015 studies have been described
earlier [18, 19]. The key inclusion criteria were patients between 16 and 70 years of age with a
clinical history of CHB and active viral replication. Patients who were willing to undergo a liver
biopsy at Visit 2 (day 7 from baseline) and FibroScan® (Echosens, Paris,
France) at Visits 2 and 4 (Week 52) were included in the study. Patients with the following abnormal
laboratory values were excluded: hemoglobin <11 g/dL for men or <10 g/dL for women; absolute
neutrophil count <1500/mm3; platelet
count <75,000/mm3; serum creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dL; serum amylase or
lipase ≥1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); prothrombin time prolonged by >3 s or prothrombin
activity <70%; serum albumin <3.3 g/dL; or total bilirubin ≥2.0 mg/dL. At the screening visit,
the following were documented: positive serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg positive or
HBeAg negative, serum HBV DNA load ≥6 log10 copies/mL, serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) level ≥1.3 × ULN but <10 × ULN and a liver biopsy compatible with CHB
obtained within 12 months prior to randomization.

Histologic Evaluations
Histologic evaluation of the liver biopsies was performed centrally at the Armed
Forces Institute of Pathology (Washington, DC) by a single pathologist who was blinded to the
clinical and laboratory data of patients. Assessments were also made to calculate the proportion of
patients with absence of inflammation on liver biopsy at study entry.

The Knodell histology activity index was used for the assessment of liver
inflammation, with biopsy specimens graded in four categories: periportal necrosis (0–10),
intralobular necrosis (0–4), portal inflammation (0–4), and fibrosis (0–4) [25]. The Knodell necroinflammatory score (maximum of 18 points) is
derived by adding the above scores, excluding the fibrosis score. A Knodell necroinflammatory
score ≤3 represents absence/minimal inflammation of liver biopsy [24, 25]. To ensure a “reference
standard”, Prof. Zachary Goodman’s hospital rules and guidelines on liver biopsy assessment (Center
for Liver Diseases, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA, USA) were followed. The protocol was
established as the current practice in our hospital. Biopsies that did not match the criteria were
excluded from the analysis.

Stages of fibrosis were assessed using the Ishak fibrosis score that ranges from 0
(no fibrosis) to 6 (cirrhosis; probable or definite) [26]. Changes in Ishak fibrosis score from baseline were categorized as: improvement
(≥1-point decrease), worsening (≥1-point increase), or no change (post-baseline score = baseline
score). Absence/minimal fibrosis of liver biopsy was defined as Ishak score ≤1; advanced
fibrosis/cirrhosis was defined as Ishak score ≥4.

Virologic, Serologic, and Biochemical Evaluations
Serum HBV DNA quantitation was performed at a central laboratory using the COBAS
Amplicor™ HBV assay (Roche Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) that utilizes polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) methods and automated sample readout technologies (limit of detection: 300 copies/mL). Other
HBV serologic markers (HBsAg/anti-HBs, HBeAg/anti-HBe) using standard commercially available assays
were also assessed centrally.

Serum Fibrosis Markers
Serum fibrosis markers were not assessed at baseline in the GLOBE/015 studies.
These were centrally tested at baseline and Week 52 of CN04E1 study period, namely Year 5 or Year 6
of long-term antiviral treatment, using standard commercially available assays. Serum concentrations
of procollagen III peptide and collagen IV were measured by radioimmunoassay (P III P RIA assay; Cis
Bio International, Gif-sur-Yvette, France) and enzyme immunoassay (Type IV collagen EIA assay;
Argutus Medical, Dublin, Ireland), respectively.

Transient Elastography Measurements
Transient elastography (FibroScan) [27, 28] was used for diagnosis and
overall assessment of hepatic fibrosis (by measuring liver stiffness) in a subgroup of 14 patients
included in study CN04E1. No measurements at baseline or during the first 5 years of treatment were
available.

Safety
The assessment of safety was based on the analysis of adverse events (AEs),
including serious AEs (SAEs) and AEs of special interest: muscle weakness, myopathy or myositis, and
peripheral nephropathy, laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations.

Glomerular Filtration Rate Evaluations
Estimates of glomerular filtration rate eGFR) are the best indices of kidney
function [29–31]. eGFR is estimated using prediction equations that take into account the serum
creatinine concentration and some or all of the following variables: age, gender, race, and body
size. In adults, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [32] or the Cockcroft–Gault equation are often used. This study used
the MDRD equation because it is more accurate and precise for persons with GFR <90 mL/min per
1.73 m2. The MDRD equation is as follows: eGFR=186×serum creatinine-1.154×age-0.203×0.742if female. 

Statistical Analysis
The safety population consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of
study drug in study CN04E1. All safety analyses were performed on the safety population throughout
the whole telbivudine treatment period. The histology analysis was performed on the histology
population of enrolled patients who had paired evaluable liver biopsy results at both feeder study
baseline and study CN04E1 entry (or at the end of study 2303 if study CN04E1 entry biopsy was not
available).

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with absence/minimal
inflammation of liver biopsy at Year 5. The main secondary histologic endpoints were: mean change
from baseline in the Knodell necroinflammatory score and Ishak fibrosis score; proportion of
patients who achieved final Knodell score ≤3 points (in patients with baseline score ≥4);
absence/minimal fibrosis of liver biopsy at Year 5; ≥1-point decrease of Ishak fibrosis; and change
of Ishak score in patients with baseline advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis.

Changes of Ishak fibrosis score and Knodell necroinflammatory score from baseline
were tested for statistical significance using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Changes in HBV DNA level,
ALT level, serum fibrosis markers, and eGFR (MDRD) were tested for significance using paired
t test. All statistical tests were bilateral with a 0.05 alpha
level of significance.

Results
The study population included 70 patients, of which 66 had at least one
post-baseline assessment of serum HBV DNA (intent-to-treat population). Of these, 57 patients had
paired evaluable liver biopsies at both baseline and after 5 years of antiviral treatment. The
baseline characteristics of these 57 patients (Table 1) were
similar in disease features to those in the GLOBE study and study 015. All patients were Chinese
with HBV genotype either B or C. Mean baseline HBV DNA load was 8.5 log10
copies/mL, Knodell necroinflammatory score was 7.6, and the Ishak fibrosis score was 2.2. Six of the
57 patients (11%) had an Ishak fibrosis score ≥4, indicating advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Thirty-three patients received telbivudine 600 mg/day for 5 years and 24 patients received
lamivudine 100 mg/day for 2 years followed by telbivudine for 3 years. Median duration of treatment
was 261 weeks.Table 1 Baseline demographics and disease characteristics of CHB patients treated with

Assessment of Liver Inflammation
Long-term treatment with telbivudine resulted in marked improvement of liver
inflammation. Figure 2a shows microphotographs of biopsy
samples from a representative patient whose Knodell score decreased from 10 (at baseline) to 1
(minimal inflammation) after long-term treatment with telbivudine. This observation was consistent
among all 57 patients (Fig. 3a).Fig. 2 Liver biopsy samples: a Baseline liver biopsy

Long-term treatment resulted in effective control of HBV replication. The
proportion of patients with no or minimal necroinflammation (defined as Knodell necroinflammatory
score ≤3) increased from 16% (9/57) at baseline to 98% (56/57) after long-term treatment
(Table 2). The mean change in baseline Knodell
necroinflammatory score was 6.3-point reduction after long-term treatment with telbivudine
(p < 0.0001). Among patients with a baseline Knodell
necroinflammatory score ≥4, almost all (98%; 47/48) achieved a Knodell score ≤3 on long-term (Year
5) biopsy samples.Table 2 Histologic, virologic, and biochemical responses of telbivudine-treated patients at the

Assessment of Liver Fibrosis
Long-term telbivudine treatment resulted in reversal of liver fibrosis
(Fig. 2b). Figure 3b
represents the evolution of Ishak fibrosis scores in all patients during long-term treatment. The
proportion of patients with no or minimal fibrosis (defined as Ishak fibrosis score ≤1) increased
from 25% (14/57) at baseline to 84% (48/57) after long-term treatment (75%) (Table 2). The mean change from baseline in the Ishak fibrosis score was a
1.3-point reduction (p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients
with ≥1-point decrease of Ishak fibrosis score was 80% (44/55; baseline score ≥1). Among patients
with a baseline Ishak fibrosis score ≥2, 84% (36/43) achieved an Ishak fibrosis score of 0 or 1 on
the long-term biopsy samples.

Out of 57 patients, six (11%) had advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at feeder study
baseline: four males and two females; four with genotype C and one with genotype B (data missing for
one patient); four were HBeAg negative and two were HBeAg positive. All six patients achieved
undetectable HBV DNA at Week 24 (baseline range 5.18–9.81 log10 copies/mL).
Of these, two patients stopped treatment at Year 6, and at 24 weeks post-treatment; undetectable HBV
DNA was maintained in one patient with a DNA load of 2.88 log10 copies/mL for
the other. At the end of 5 years’ treatment, all patients had Knodell necroinflammatory scores ≤3
(baseline range 7–11) and an Ishak fibrosis score of 3 (baseline range 4–6). Median score reduction
of Ishak fibrosis score was 3 (range 1–3; p = 0.0313).
Procollagen III peptide and collagen IV normalized in all six patients.

Serum Liver Fibrosis Markers
The mean (SD) levels of procollagen III peptide were 0.46 (0.18) U/mL at Year 5,
and 0.45 (0.09) U/mL at Year 6 of prolonged treatment, without significant change (p = 0.5031). Both values were within the normal range of 0.3–0.8 U/mL. The
mean (SD) levels of collagen IV were 90.0 (18.0) µg/L at Year 5 and increased to 111.1 (24.1) µg/L
at the end of Year 6 (p < 0.0001), both values were within the
normal range (range 53–145 µg/L).

Liver Stiffness Measurements
In a subgroup of 14 patients with available data, liver stiffness measurement (LSM)
from study CN04E1 entry to Week 52 (Year 5 to 6) decreased from 5.45 kPa (Year 5) to 4.75 kPa (Year
6) during treatment. At Week 24 post-treatment, the median LSM was 4.90 kPa.

Virologic and Biochemical Response
At the time of long-term biopsy, 100% (n = 66)
of patients had undetectable HBV DNA as determined by PCR. The median HBV DNA level decrease was
−7.6 log10 copies/mL in HBeAg-positive patients (p < 0.0001) and −5.3 log10 copies/mL in HBeAg-negative
patients (p < 0.0001). The median time to maintained PCR
negativity (defined as HBV DNA <300 copies/mL for at least two consecutive visits) was 168 days
in HBeAg-positive patients and 116 days in HBeAg-negative patients. After 6 years (2190 days) of
treatment, median duration of maintained PCR negativity was 2019 days in HBeAg-positive patients and
2030 days in HBeAg-negative patients.

The proportion of patients who achieved serum ALT normalization at the time of
long-term biopsy was 82% (50/61). Mean (SD) serum ALT levels decreased significantly from 201 (145)
at feeder study baseline to 30 (18) IU/mL at the time of long-term biopsy (p < 0.0001).

Changes in HBeAg and HBsAg
Among the 43 HBeAg-positive patients at baseline, 88% (38/43) achieved cumulative
HBeAg loss and 77% (33/43) achieved HBeAg seroconversion during the long-term treatment period. The
median time to maintained HBeAg loss (defined as HBeAg loss for at least two consecutive visits) was
703 days. Cumulative HBsAg loss was achieved in 6.1% of patients (4/66) (Table 2).

Safety Evaluations
Among the safety population, telbivudine was well tolerated over the 6-year
treatment period (95.7% of patients received telbivudine for ≥208 weeks). Eight patients (11.4%)
reported SAEs (3 surgeries, 3 infections, 1 polymyositis, and 1 abortion); none of them were drug
related. The patient with polymyositis recovered within 6 months while continuing telbivudine
treatment. No death occurred during the study period (6 years). No AE caused permanent drug
discontinuation.

The most frequent AE of special interest was blood creatine kinase increase (11.4%;
8 patients). One patient (1.4%) experienced muscular weakness. According to the investigator’s
judgment, this moderately severe muscle-related AE was linked to telbivudine treatment. There were
no severe AEs of special interest observed. There were no reports of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis,
lactic acidosis, or pancreatitis as an AE in this study. On-treatment ALT flares (AASLD definition)
[33] were reported in 17.1% (12/70) of patients, mainly
during the first 6 months of treatment.

Glomerular Filtration Rate Evaluations
GFR, assessed using the MDRD equation, increased steadily from baseline to the end
of 6 years of treatment. Mean GFR increased by 60.5% at 6 years (Fig. 4). At Week 312 (year 6), 94.9% of patients with baseline GFR
60–90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mild renal insufficiency) shifted to
GFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m2. There was only one HBeAg-negative patient who
had presented with GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline and this patient
shifted to GFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 after 6 years of treatment. No
patient with baseline GFR >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 shifted to GFR
60–90 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Year 6.Fig. 4 Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) improvement assessed by Modification of Diet Renal
Disease (MDRD) change from baseline to year 6. The graph presents the percentage GFR increase for

Discussion
The present study demonstrated that prolonged telbivudine treatment effectively
controls HBV replication. This results in marked improvement of liver histology, resolution of
inflammation, improvement (reversal) of liver fibrosis, and extends previous findings. In the GLOBE
phase 3 study, histologic response (defined as a reduction of ≥2 points in the Knodell
necroinflammatory score) was observed in 64.7% of patients as early as Week 48 [18]. Among patients who had marked fibrosis/cirrhosis, the Ishak
fibrosis score improved (Ishak score ≤3) in 68% and 59% of HBeAg-negative and HBeAg-positive
patients, respectively [18].

In the present analysis, the long-term improvement on fibrosis in
nucleos(t)ide-naïve CHB patients was confirmed after a median exposure of 5 years. In patients with
baseline Ishak score ≥1, 80% (44/55) had ≥1-point decrease after 5 years of treatment; in 43
patients with baseline Ishak score ≥2, 84% (36/43) presented ≥1-point decrease after 5 years of
treatment. Six patients with advanced fibrosis at baseline showed marked reduction of Ishak score
(median reduction of 3.0). This further highlights the potential benefit of successfully controlling
HBV replication in the reversal of advanced liver fibrosis. Improvements in the liver biopsies
correlated with normalized serum liver fibrosis markers, along with the normal
FibroScan® values in a subgroup of patients after long-term
treatment.

A high proportion of patients achieved HBeAg loss/seroconversion (88%/77%)
[24]. Previous long-term histologic trials reported an
improvement of necroinflammation and fibrosis, respectively, in 56% and 24% of patients treated with
lamivudine (3 years); 67% and 60% of HBeAg-positive patients and 83% and 71–73% of HBeAg-negative
patients treated with adefovir (5 years), respectively [14, 22, 23]. In a recent large-scale prospective study examining changes in liver histology
during tenofovir treatment, paired biopsies from 348 patients showed that 176 (51%) patients
demonstrated regression of fibrosis after 5 years of treatment [34]. The effects of telbivudine in regression of fibrosis (80–84% improvement in
fibrosis) showed consistent efficacy reported with other antiviral trials.

Although these long-term histologic trials are not directly comparable, data from a
6-year entecavir trial suggested that telbivudine achieved numerically better histologic
improvement, particularly in patients with high necroinflammation score at baseline: 98% and 75% of
patients in telbivudine and entecavir treatment cohorts, respectively, (baseline Knodell score ≥4)
achieved necroinflammatory score ≤3. The proportion of patients with ≥1-point decrease in Ishak
fibrosis score (baseline Ishak score ≥2) was 84% for telbivudine and 72% for entecavir. Better
serologic results in the long-term cohorts were also in favor of telbivudine versus entecavir: HBeAg
loss (88% vs. 55%, respectively), HBeAg seroconversion (77% vs. 33%), HBsAg loss (6% vs. 0%), and
HBsAg seroconversion (5% vs. 0%). Moreover, the higher HBsAg loss is important since there were more
patients with genotypes B/C in the telbivudine cohort (100% vs. 60% in entecavir cohort). Patients
with genotype A/D are more likely to lose HBsAg compared with genotype B/C [35, 36]. As previously
reported, the overall rate of HBsAg loss in telbivudine-treated patients with HBV genotype A/D
(4/21, 19.0%) was significantly higher than in patients with genotype B/C (5/141, 3.5%; p = 0.0174) [37]. The
significant improvement of renal function in CHB patients, especially with abnormal eGFR at
baseline, shows potential benefit of telbivudine long-term treatment [34, 38]. The mechanism is not fully
established and is under investigation.

The limited number of patients (n = 57) with
available liver histology results at both baseline and post-treatment is mainly due to the lack of
prospective design of investigating liver histologic change after long-term antiviral therapy in the
telbivudine clinical development program. When the phase 3 (GLOBE and 015) studies were designed,
only baseline liver biopsy or 1-year biopsy (for GLOBE study only) was required. During the
implementation of these studies, after Novartis took over the ownership of this study from Idenix,
Novartis made an amendment with the main objective of collecting post-treatment biopsy samples after
4 years of treatment in study CLDT600A2303. Many patients were lost because the effective date of
the amendment was after the last patient’s last visit. Meanwhile, as the Chinese study CN04 (5 year
treatment) had enrolled the majority of Chinese patients after treatment in study 2303, an extension
study was made to the CN04 study to collect post long-term treatment liver biopsy samples, which was
the current CLDT600ACN04E1 study.

Conclusion
In conclusion, long-term telbivudine treatment for nucleos(t)ide-naïve patients,
including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline, led to maintained suppression of
HBV DNA, favorable cumulative HBeAg/HBsAg responses, and significant improvement of liver
inflammation. Regression of fibrosis was also observed, which is supported by normalized levels of
serum fibrosis marker and FibroScan® values. Histologic improvement
observed at the time of the long-term biopsy was higher than the 1-year treatment values, thus
substantiating the interest of long-term telbivudine treatment in CHB. Therefore, the present data
support the conclusion that long-term treatment with telbivudine results in profound and durable
virologic suppression and significant improvement in liver histology, thus achieving the ultimate
antiviral treatment goals in CHB patients. The FibroScan® results at 5
and 6 years (in almost 20% of patients) were consistent with this information.
