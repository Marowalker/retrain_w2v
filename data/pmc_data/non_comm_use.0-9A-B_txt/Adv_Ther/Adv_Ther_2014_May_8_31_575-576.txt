The authors of the above-mentioned paper would like to make the following adjustments to their article.

In Table 1, the value in the Resolved row in the column Diarrhea, Placebo [n (%)] currently reads ‘73 (52)’. This should read ‘73 (86)’. The correct version of the table is provided below (Table 1). The sentence ‘At Week 72, pirfenidone also reduced the proportion of patients with a 50 m or greater decrement in 6-min walk distance (31% relative reduction vs. placebo) and...' in the original article should read ‘At Week 72, pirfenidone also reduced the proportion of patients with a 50 m or greater decrement in 6-min walk distance (26% relative reduction vs. placebo) and...'. The sentence ‘Overall, five (1.4%) and one (0.3%) pirfenidone patients discontinued therapy due to nausea and vomiting, respectively, and two (0.6%) discontinued due to diarrhea' in the original article should read ‘Overall, five (1.4%) and one (0.3%) pirfenidone patients discontinued therapy due to nausea and vomiting, respectively, and two (0.6%) placebo patients discontinued due to diarrhea'.Table 1 Gastrointestinal adverse events in the CAPACITY studies
