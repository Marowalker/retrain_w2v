Correction to: Adv Ther (2019) 36:3409–3423 https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-019-01112-3
In the Original Article, there is an error in the “participants” section of Results. The correct sentence is “A total of 213 participants took part in the studies, including 34 patients with acromegaly and 28 patients with NETs”.

There is one more correction in the “Formative Studies: Development of the New Syringe” section of Results. The correct sentence is “Nevertheless, needle gauge and length (approximately 18 gauge needle/20 mm) were retained from the previous lanreotide autogel/depot syringe, as reducing needle gauge and length could increase injection force and risk of injection failure to reach the deep subcutaneous tissue”.
