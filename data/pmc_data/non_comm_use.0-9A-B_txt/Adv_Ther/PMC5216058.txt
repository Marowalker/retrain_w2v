Erratum to: Adv Ther (2016) 33:894–909 DOI 10.1007/s12325-016-0338-1
Unfortunately, in the original publication of the article, the information regarding PlasmaDerm (CINOGY GmbH) device in Table 1 has been incorrectly published. The table states that the device operates with argon (Gas column), its frequency is DC (Frequency column) and the flow is 8 slm (Flow column).

However, this information should be changed as the PlasmaDerm (CINOGY GmbH) device operates in ambient air (Gas column), its frequency is AC (Frequency column), and this device is not running any gas flow (Flow column).

The online version of the original article can be found under doi:10.1007/s12325-016-0338-1.
