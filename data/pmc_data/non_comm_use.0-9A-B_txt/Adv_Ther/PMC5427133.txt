The authors of this manuscript have noticed two mistakes since publication:

1. In the Methods section of the paper (under “Search strategy”) it reads “The search strategy for MEDLINE is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1 (Fig. S1) and the other searches are available on request.”

It should read

“The search strategy for MEDLINE is shown in Supplemental Fig. 1 (Fig. S1) and the other searches are also available in the supplementary material from page 28 onwards.”

2. In the supplementary material in Table S2, in the Medline row the number ‘2845’ should be ‘6845’.
