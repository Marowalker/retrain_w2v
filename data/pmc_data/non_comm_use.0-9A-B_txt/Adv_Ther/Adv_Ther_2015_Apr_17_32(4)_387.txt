The authors wish to notify the readers that although the above mentioned article addressed different research questions and therefore evaluated different endpoints, the study employed a similar study design using the same sample of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) treated with either rivaroxaban or warfarin as the study sample reported in a study published in Clinical Therapeutics by the present authors [1]. The current research focused on the economic evaluation of the effect of rivaroxaban versus warfarin among matched cohorts. Because the two articles were accepted for publication at the same time, the authors want to cross-reference both articles in the current addendum for clarity and transparency.
