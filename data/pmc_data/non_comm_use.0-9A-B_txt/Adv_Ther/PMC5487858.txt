Author wants to correct the text under the heading of Introduction.

The sentence is written as:

“In the ZENITH study, both treatments had a similar positive effect on regression of cardiac and renal damage, whereas a larger proportion of patients showing carotid plaque regression was observed under zofenopril (31.6% vs. 16.1%; p = 0.047), particularly in the subgroup of patients taking the low dose of zofenopril (30 mg) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg (4.7% vs 10.0% irbesartan 150 mg plus HCTZ 12.5 mg; p = 0.043)”.

The correct sentence should read:

“In the ZENITH study, both treatments had a similar positive effect on regression of cardiac and renal damage, whereas a larger proportion of patients showing carotid plaque regression was observed under zofenopril (31.6% vs. 16.1%; p = 0.047). Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients taking the low dose of zofenopril (30 mg) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg the rate of those exhibiting a carotid plaque at study end was significantly lower than that in the subgroup of patients taking the low dose of irbesartan (150 mg) plus HCTZ 12.5 mg (4.7% vs 10.0%; p = 0.043)”.
