Erratum to: Adv Ther (2017) 34:954–965 DOI 10.1007/s12325-017-0502-2
In the original publication, Figure 3 was published incorrectly with errors. In Fig. 3, the “Not defined*” labels should appear in the ‘Insulin Glargine U100’ row of the table beneath the figure. In place of these the values ‘41,530’ and ‘57,642’, respectively, should appear in the IDegLira row of the table beneath the figure. It has been corrected and the correct version is provided below.Fig. 3 Cost of control: patients with HbA1c >9.0% at baseline. $, 2015 US dollars; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin. *Cost of control values cannot be calculated in the insulin glargine U100 arm for HbA1c ≤6.5% without weight gain and HbA1c ≤6.5% without confirmed hypoglycemia and weight gain, as no patients in the insulin glargine U100 arm achieved these treatment targets
