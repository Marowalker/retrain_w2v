There is a mistake in the Contributors section. It should say:

“Contributors HS and NZ developed the conception and design of the study and performed data interpretation. HS performed statistical analysis, wrote and finalized the manuscript. NZ revised the manuscript. GS and KD participated in the data collection and interpretation. CS, MC, RR critically revised the manuscript and supervised statistical analysis. RR and GS critically revised the manuscript, and GS initiated coordinated and supervised the trial. All of the authors read and approved the final manuscript”.
