Mansikkamäki K, Raitanen J, Nygård C-H, et al. Long-term effect of physical activity on health-related quality of life among menopausal women: a 4-year follow-up study to a randomised controlled trial. BMJ Open 2015;5:e008232. There are several errors in this manuscript and are described below.

1. On page 2, ‘Statistical analysis’ section the following sentence is incorrect:

The odds model was used for analysis of the association between the outcomes both on the physical dimensions (physical functioning; role functioning, physical; freedom from pain; and physical health) and on the psychological dimensions (role functioning; emotional; vitality; emotional well-being; social functioning; general health; and mental health) over time and between the intervention versus the control group.

The correct sentence is:

The odds model was used for analysis of the association between the outcomes both on the physical dimensions (physical functioning; role functioning, physical; freedom from pain; and physical health) and on the psychological dimensions (role functioning, emotional; vitality; emotional well-being; social functioning; general health; and mental health) over time and between the intervention versus the control group.

2. On page 3, the sentence ‘The proportions for the physical and mental dimensions of QoL by time are shown in figures 1 and 2.’ should be ‘The proportions for the physical and mental dimensions of QoL by time are shown in figures 2 and 3.’

3. In figure 3, the middle left panel should be titled ‘Social functioning’ and the lower left panel should be titled ‘General health’.

4. Reference 7 is incorrect. The corrected reference is:

Mansikkamäki K, Raitanen J, Nygård C-H, et al. Sleep quality and aerobic training among menopausal women – A randomized controlled trial. Maturitas 2012;72:339–45.
