Feehan M, Morrison MA, Tak C, et al. Factors predicting self-reported medication low adherence in a large sample of adults in the US general population: a cross-sectional study. BMJ Open 2017;7:e014435. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014435

The description of the cutoff of the Morisky scale was listed as ‘6 or 7’ but have been ‘6 to <8’. Therefore, the sentences:

‘MMAS-8 scores can range from 0 to 8 with low adherence defined as a score <6, medium adherence as scores of 6 or 7 and high adherence with a score of 8.’

should have read

‘MMAS-8 scores can range from 0 to 8 with low adherence defined as a score <6, medium adherence as scores of 6 to <8 and high adherence with a score of 8.’

and

‘Using the standard cutoffs for the Morisky scale, 3862 (42%) respondents had “low” self-reported adherence (<6 on the scale), 2706 (29.4%) had “medium” adherence (6 or 7 on the scale) and 2635 (28.6) had ‘high’ adherence

(score of 8).’
