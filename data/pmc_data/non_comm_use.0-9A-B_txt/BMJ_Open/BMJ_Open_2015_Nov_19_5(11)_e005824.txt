Tsunoda K, Kai Y, Uchida K, et al. Physical activity and risk of fatty liver in people with different levels of alcohol consumption: a prospective cohort study. BMJ Open 2014;4:e005824. There are three corrections in this paper. These corrections do not change any results or conclusions of the paper.
Throughout the paper, the frequencies of physical activity, ‘>2x/week’ and ‘>3x/week’, should be corrected to ‘≥2x/week’ and ‘≥3x/week’, respectively.

In Table 2, the entry on the line for Model 1 of Moderate-intensity physical activity in the 2x column (0.74 (0.54 to 1.01)) should not be italicised.

Table 2 lists aspartate aminotransferase as an adjustment variable. However, as mentioned in the statistical methods, the correct hazard models do not include aspartate aminotransferase, so it should be removed from the table's adjustment variables.
