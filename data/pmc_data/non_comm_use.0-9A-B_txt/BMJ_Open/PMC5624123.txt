Huntley JD, Gould RL, Liu K, et al. Do cognitive interventions improve general cognition in dementia? A meta-analysis and meta-regression. BMJ Open 2015;5:e005247. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005247

There is an error in the reporting of the CIs in the abstract compared with those reported in the results section and figures 2 and 3 of the paper.

In the Abstract, the sentence,

‘Significant positive effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were found for CS with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (g=0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.69; p<0.001) compared to non-active controls and (g=0.35, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.65; p=0.019) compared to active controls.’

should read:

‘Significant positive effect sizes (Hedges’ g) were found for CS with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) (g=0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.66; p<0.001) compared to non-active controls and (g=0.35, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.64; p=0.019) compared to active controls.’
