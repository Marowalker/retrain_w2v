To determine whether antiviral therapy reduces the risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C.

Design
Systematic review and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Prospective
cohort studies were included in sensitivity analyses.

Data Sources
Eligible trials were identified through electronic and manual searches.

Study Selection
Eight randomised controlled trials comparing antiviral therapy (interferon or
pegylated interferon alone or with ribavirin) versus placebo or no intervention
were included.

Data extraction and synthesis
Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality of studies and
extracted data. Random effects meta-analyses were performed. Subgroup,
sensitivity, regression and sequential analyses were performed to evaluate sources
of intertrial heterogeneity, the risk of bias and the robustness of the results
after adjusting for multiple testing.

Results
Random effects meta-analysis showed that antiviral therapy reduced the risk of HCC
(81/1156 vs 129/1174; risk ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.81). In subgroup
analyses, antiviral therapy was more beneficial (test for subgroup differences
p=0.03) in virological responders (0.15, 0.05 to 0.45) than in
non-responders (0.57; 0.37 to 0.85). No evidence of bias was seen in regression
analyses. Sequential analysis confirmed the overall result. The sensitivity
analyses showed that the cohort studies found that antiviral therapy reduced the
risk of HCC. There was clear statistical evidence of bias in the cohort studies
(p=0.02).

Conclusions
Antiviral therapy may reduce the risk of HCC in hepatitis C-related fibrosis and
cirrhosis. The effect may be seen irrespective of the virological response, but is
more pronounced among virological responders compared with non-responders.

Article summary
Article focus
To determine whether antiviral therapy reduces the risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C.

Key messages
Antiviral therapy reduces the risk of HCC.

The preventive effect of antiviral therapy on the development of HCC is seen
irrespective of the antiviral response (loss of hepatitis C virus RNA), but is
more pronounced among patients who are virological responders.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The review only addresses interferon as monotherapy.

No points on dose and duration can be made on the available data.

HCC incidence is diminished in both virological responders and
non-responders.

A thorough systematic review and meta-analysis provide confidence in the
findings.

Introduction
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant diseases
accounting for approximately 90% of primary liver cancers.1
2 Hepatitis C and cirrhosis are two of the most
important risk factors for the development of HCC.3 Among patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis the estimated annual
incidence of HCC ranges from 1% to 4%1 depending on the severity of the underlying liver disease and ethnicity of
the patient.1
4

Hepatitis C is an insidious disease that often leads to chronic infection. Few patients
clear the virus spontaneously. Antiviral Therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis C
may lead to a sustained loss of the virus.5
6 A number of patients with an initial response
relapse within a few months after treatment. For patients who achieve a 24-week
sustained virological response (SVR), the risk of relapse is negligible.7 The proportion of patients who achieve a
virological response depends on the underlying viral genotype and on the type of
therapy. Interferon was introduced in 1986 and initially used as monotherapy.8 Subsequent trials showed that the addition of
ribavirin and the use of a pegylated form of interferon increased the number of
sustained virological responders.5
6
9
10 The effect of antiviral therapy on clinical
outcome measures is debated. Some studies have found that interferon increases survival
and reduces the incidence of HCC.11–13 Some data also suggest a reduction in HCC in non-sustained
responders.14 Whether a SVR is the key factor
leading to a reduced risk of developing HCC is not known. Other studies and randomised
trials as well as systematic reviews did not find beneficial effects of antiviral
therapy on mortality or morbidity.15
 16

Methods
The main objective of the present review was to determine the effect of antiviral
therapy versus placebo or no intervention for the prevention of HCC in hepatitis
C-related cirrhosis or fibrosis, and to assess the importance of virological response to
treatment in relation to risk of HCC.

The review was carried and reported out based on a protocol developed using the methods
described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analyses) Statement for Reporting Systematic Reviews and
Meta-analysis.17
18

Trials on patients with hepatitis C-related cirrhosis or fibrosis treated with antiviral
therapy were included if reporting any of the outcome measures assessed. Our primary
analyses included randomised controlled trials. Prospective cohort studies with defined
control groups were included in sensitivity analyses. Trials were included irrespective
of language or publication status. The dose, type and duration of therapy were not
considered in the inclusion criteria. Trials on interferon or pegylated interferon alone
or with ribavirin were eligible for inclusion. Trials on patients with HIV and patients
with chronic hepatitis B were excluded. The primary outcome measure was HCC. Secondary
outcomes were overall mortality, HCC-related mortality, liver-related mortality (defined
as death following variceal bleeding, hepatorenal syndrome, liver failure or spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis) and liver-related morbidity (variceal bleeding, hepatorenal
syndrome, liver failure or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).

Two authors (NK and AK) participated in the literature searches. Excluded trials were
listed with the reason for exclusion. Two authors (NK and ED) performed independent
standardised data extraction. Extracted data were validated by two authors (AK and
LG).

Search strategy identification of eligible trials
Eligible trials were identified through electronic searches of the Cochrane Library
(issue 3, 2012), PubMed (1966−August 2012), EMBASE (1955−August 2012)
and Web of Science (1900−August 2012). Additional searches were performed
including scanning of reference lists from relevant papers on chronic hepatitis C and
HCC, conference proceedings and the World Health Organization Trial Search Portal
(www.who.int/trialsearch/). All authors were contacted by email with
enquiries of additional data.

Assessment of bias control
The quality of bias control was assessed through individual components.17 Based on previous evidence,19 our primary assessment of bias control was
based on the randomisation methods including the allocation sequence generation
(classed as adequate if based on a table of random numbers or similar) or allocation
concealment (classed as adequate if based on a central independent unit or similar).
Trials in which randomisation methods were classed as adequate were defined as having
a low risk of bias. Additional components included blinding (performance bias and
detection bias), handling of missing outcome data (attrition bias) and selective
reporting (reporting bias). We also extracted sample size calculations and whether
the sample size was reached or the trial was terminated prematurely. Due to the risk
of selection bias associated with the observational design, all cohort studies were
classed as having a high risk of bias.

Statistical analysis
The analyses were performed using Revman V.5.1 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen),
STATA V.11 (STATA Corp, College Station, Texas, USA) and TSA V.9 (Copenhagen Trial
Unit, Copenhagen, Denmark). The primary meta-analyses were performed using random
effect models due to an expected clinical heterogeneity (differences between patient
and intervention characteristics).The results of the analyses were presented as risk
ratios with 95% CI and I2 as a marker of intertrial heterogeneity.
We defined I2 values between 30% and 60% as moderate
heterogeneity and values >60% as substantial heterogeneity. The number
needed to treat was calculated as the inverse of the risk difference. Fixed effect
meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. The results
were only reported if the overall conclusion differed from the result of the random
effects meta-analysis. To evaluate the risk of bias and the influence of patient
characteristics, the results of the analysis was analysed after exclusion of trials
without adequate randomisation and trials including patients with fibrosis. The risk
of bias and small study effects was assessed through regression analyses
(Egger's test). Planned subgroup analyses evaluated the effect of virological
response (virological responders compared with non-responders). Differences between
subgroups were analysed using the test of subgroup differences and the results
expressed using the p values.20 A sequential
analysis was performed to adjust for the risk of false-positive findings due to
repeated tests.21 The sequential analysis was
performed for the primary random effects meta-analysis. Based on the results of the
primary meta-analysis, the incidence in the control group was set to 12% and
the relative risk reduction to 41%. The heterogeneity correction was set to
64% (model-based), power to 80% and α to 5%.

Results
Study selection
The electronic searches generated 1711 references (figure 1). After reading the titles and
abstracts, we identified 26 potentially relevant randomised controlled trials and
observational studies described in 27 references. Fourteen additional trials and
references were identified through the manual searches. Twenty-four references were
retrospective cohort studies, case−control studies or trials that did not
assess the risk of HCC. Eight randomised trials,15
22–28 and five
prospective cohort studies29–33 were included in our analyses.

Characteristics of included trials and patients
All trials were published in English as full paper articles. The trials were
conducted in France, Italy, Spain, Japan and USA. All patients underwent
ultrasound, serological testing and a liver biopsy at baseline. The diagnosis of
chronic hepatitis C was based on hepatitis C virus RNA for at least
6 months and active hepatitis on liver histology. Two randomised trials
included patients with cirrhosis or fibrosis (table 1). The remaining trials included
patients with cirrhosis. Two randomised trials assessed pegylated interferon15
25 and one assessed interferon plus
ribavirin.22 The remaining trials
assessed interferon monotherapy. All control groups received no intervention. The
duration of therapy varied from 1 to 5 years and the duration of follow-up
ranged from 2 to 8.7 years. The observational studies compared interferon
versus no intervention for patients with cirrhosis. The duration of therapy ranged
from 0.5 to 1.5 years and the duration of follow-up from 5 to
7 years.

Risk of bias
Randomisation methods (allocation sequence generation and allocation concealment)
were classified as adequate in six trials.15
22
24–26
28 Two trials did not describe how the
allocation sequence was generated or the allocation sequence was concealed. None of
the trials found discrepancies between baseline patient characteristics in the
intervention versus control group. None of the included trials were blinded. No clear
evidence of reporting or attrition bias was identified. Five trials reported sample
size calculations and that the planned sample size was achieved.15
24–26
28 Two trials were registered in clinical
trial databases 3 months after the enrolment of the first patient and before
the completion of the trial.15

Intervention effects: HCC
In total, 81 of 1156 patients randomised to antiviral therapy and 129 of 1074
patients in the control group developed HCC. Random effects meta-analysis showed that
antiviral therapy reduced the risk of HCC (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.81;
I2 50%; figure
2). The corresponding number needed to treat to prevent one case of HCC was
eight patients. There was no evidence of bias or small study effects in regression
analysis (Egger's test p=0.931). The sequential analysis revealed that
the cumulative Z-curve crossed the monitoring boundary, which confirmed the overall
result after adjusting for multiple testing. Similar results were achieved after
exclusion of trials without adequate randomisation which confirmed the overall result
(RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.95) and trials on patients with fibrosis (RR 0.51,
95% CI 0.34 to 0.77). In subgroup analysis (figure 3), the effect of antiviral therapy was
more pronounced (test for subgroup differences p=0.03) among patients with a
virological response (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.45, Egger's test
p=0.543) compared with virological non-responders (RR 0.57; 95% 0.37 to
0.85, Egger's test p=0.425).

Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the results of the observational
studies. In agreement with our primary analyses, the observational studies found that
antiviral therapy reduces the risk of developing HCC (RR 0.29 95% CI 0.12 to
0.69) (figure 2). The analysis
also found a higher degree of heterogeneity among observational studies
(I2 75%) than among randomised trials (33%). Regression
analysis showed clear evidence of bias in the observational studies (Egger's
test p=0.02).

Intervention effects: mortality and liver-related complications
Four randomised trials reported all-cause mortality.15
25
26
28 Random effects meta-analysis found no clear
difference between the intervention and control group (93/918 vs 90/932; RR 0.81,
95% CI 0.33 to 2.03; I2 84%; Egger's test
p=0.348). No beneficial or detrimental effects were identified when analysing
liver-related mortality (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.51; I2
74%; Egger's test p=0.59, four trials) or liver-related
morbidity (34/400 vs 42/389, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11, I2
0%; Egger's test p=0.306).

Discussion
This review found that antiviral therapy may prevent HCC in patients with hepatitis
C-related fibrosis or cirrhosis. The size of the effect was clinically relevant with a
number needed to treat of eight patients after a median of 5 years. Based on the
relatively high event rates, the underlying prognosis of the included patients may
differ from the patient population in some clinical settings. However, after considering
the risk of detection or ascertainment bias the size of the effect was clinically
relevant. The evidence concerning all-cause and liver-related mortality and morbidity
was less convincing. Additional evidence is needed to assess these outcome measures.

Our subgroup analyses suggest that the antiviral therapy may have beneficial effects on
the risk of developing HCC that are unrelated to the virological response. Although the
intervention was more beneficial among sustained virological responders than
non-responders, there was a clear effect in both patient groups. A former review14 reached similar conclusions, but included
randomised controlled trials and observational studies in their overall analysis.

The assessment of intervention effects on clinical outcome measures is difficult to
assess in trials of a diseases with a protracted course. Complications to hepatitis C
including cirrhosis and HCC takes years to develop.34

We originally planned to include observational studies in sensitivity analysis because
we expected that the randomised controlled trials would be too small or have
insufficient follow-up. We were surprised to find that the duration of follow-up was
slightly longer in the randomised trials than in the observational studies. Likewise,
the statistical power of the randomised trials was not weaker than the observational
studies. Since we also found a high degree of heterogeneity and evidence of bias in the
observational studies, the result of these studies should only be used with caution. Our
findings do not support the inclusion of non-randomised studies in systematic reviews on
viral hepatitis.

Only two of the included trials evaluated pegylated interferon, which is the current
standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C.7 Two
studies have found that prolonged treatment with interferon reduces inflammation in the
liver24
35 and improve the proportion of patients who
achieve a SVR.36 The duration of treatment in
some of our included trials was relatively long, which may increase the proportion of
responders. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform subgroup analyses on treatment
duration or dose due to the variation in these parameters across trials. Our data
provide no information on the best standard for duration of treatment or dose.

As expected, we found clinical heterogeneity between trials. The differences between
trials were related to the type of intervention regimens and patient inclusion
criteria.

Most of the included trials assessed interferon monotherapy. Standard practise is
pegylated interferon and ribavirin in combination,7 and direct extrapolation of the observed effects to clinical practise is
difficult. The protection from HCC might be even better among patients in current
antiviral therapy since the proportion of virological responders continues to increase
with ongoing improvements in therapy.1 Also,
today's patients are diagnosed and treated earlier in the course of their
disease.

Chronic inflammation of the liver is critical to the development of HCC.37 Hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis or fibrosis
are likely to have a higher degree of chronic inflammation than patients without these
histological changes. It is therefore likely that patients without fibrosis or cirrhosis
have a smaller benefit of antiviral therapy than the patient population included in our
analyses. The number needed to treat may therefore be higher.

During recent years, large randomised trials with long-term follow-up and adequate bias
control have been published. The overall result of this meta-analysis was that
interferon reduces the risk of HCC. Our results add to previous evidence by showing that
the reduced risk of HCC is stable when assessed in randomised trials with long-term
follow-up. The increased internal validity that is achieved when the results are based
on trials with a higher degree of bias control supports the extent to which the overall
results may be extrapolated to clinical practise.

The development of HCC involves inflammatory mediators, which promote liver cancer by
compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes in response to tissue damage.37 Experimental models show that the cytokine
interferon-γ suppresses chemical carcinogenesis in hepatocytes in spite of
concomitant liver injury. Prolonged treatment with interferon reduces inflammation in
the liver.24
35 The potential anticarcinogenic effect of
interferon could be related to its immunoregulatory and antitumoral effects. The
combined evidence suggests that interferon may have other beneficial effects than the
direct antiviral activity. Based on the duration of follow-up and the lack of clear
evidence concerning morbidity or mortality, we cannot exclude that interferon delays
rather than prevents carcinogenesis. Additional randomised trials with longer follow-up
are still warranted to determine whether this is the case.
