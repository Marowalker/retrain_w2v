Equity in physical health of patients with severe mental disorders is a major
public health concern. The aim of this cohort study was to examine equity in
access to coronary care among persons with a history of severe mental disorder in
1998–2009.

Design
Nationwide register linkage cohort study.

Setting
Hospital care in the Finnish healthcare system.

Population
The study population consisted of all residents in Finland aged 40 years or
older. All hospital discharges in 1998–2009 with a diagnosis of coronary
heart disease or severe mental disorder were obtained from the Care Register.

Primary outcome measures
Data on deaths, hospitalisations and coronary revascularisations were linked to
the data set using unique personal identifiers.

Results
Patients with severe mental disorders had increased likelihood of hospital care
due to coronary heart disease (RR between 1.22, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.25 and 1.93, 1.84
to 2.03 in different age groups) and in 40–49-year-olds also increased
likelihood of revascularisation (1.26, 1.16 to 1.38) compared with persons without
mental disorders. Access to revascularisation was poorer among older persons with
severe mental disorders in relation to need suggested by increased coronary
mortality. In spite of excess coronary mortality (ranging from 0.95, 0.89 to 1.01
to 3.16, 2.82 to 3.54), worst off were people with a history of psychosis, who did
not have increased use of hospital care and had lower likelihood of receiving
revascularisations (ranging from 0.44, 0.37 to 0.51 to 0.74, 0.59 to 0.93)
compared with persons without mental disorders.

Conclusions
Selective mechanisms seem to be at work in access to care and revascularisations
among people with severe mental disorders. Healthcare professionals need to be
aware of the need for targeted measures to address challenges in provision of
somatic care among people with severe mental health problems, especially among
people with psychoses and old people.

Article summary
Article focus
Equity in physical health of patients with severe mental disorders is a major
public health concern since increased morbidity and mortality due to somatic
disorders has repeatedly been reported among them.

The aim of this cohort study was to examine equity in access to coronary care
among persons with a history of severe mental disorder in Finland in
1998–2009.

Key messages
Our results show poor access to coronary revascularisation according to need
among people with severe mental disorders and especially poor access to
hospital care and revascularisations among people with psychotic disorders.

Healthcare professionals need to be aware of the need for targeted measures to
address challenges in provision of somatic care among people with severe mental
health problems, especially among people with psychoses and old people.

Strengths and limitations of this study
We used nationwide, unselective representative data concerning the total
population of Finnish residents in 1998–2009 collected from
administrative registers with full coverage and based on clinical diagnoses,
which allowed us to put the outcomes in proportion to the population at
risk.

We were able to examine the three major diagnostic groups of severe mental
disorders, namely mood disorders, psychotic disorders and substance abuse
disorders.

Our data do not enable us to evaluate whether the poor access to care according
to need among people with severe mental disorders is due to delay or avoidance
in seeking care or poorer responsiveness of the healthcare system to somatic
health problems of these vulnerable patient groups.
==== Body
Introduction
Equity in health and equal access to healthcare according to need among vulnerable
groups, such as people with severe mental disorders, is an indicator of well-functioning
health systems. Nevertheless, increased morbidity and mortality due to somatic
disorders, including cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and cancer, has
repeatedly been reported in persons with severe mental disorders compared with the total
population.1–8
These findings may derive both from increased incidence and higher case death among
patients with mental disorders.9
10 Unhealthier lifestyles, poorer socioeconomic
circumstances, adverse metabolic effects of antipsychotic medications and social
consequences of mental illness such as social isolation are likely to explain part of
the excess mortality. Another important factor likely to contribute to these differences
is poorer access to and quality of healthcare.11
12


Accordingly, earlier studies have found elevated coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality
but reported no or only slightly elevated use of hospital in- or outpatient care
compared with other coronary patients.9
13 Studies have further reported that persons
with a history of psychoactive substance use disorders, psychosis or mood disorders are
less likely to receive β blockers, aspirin, ACE inhibitors and statins compared
with other coronary patients,14–18 to be less likely to have had a recent check-up of their
cholesterol or blood pressure level15
19 and to undergo revascularisation operations
less often.9

20 Similar results concerning coronary
revascularisations have been reported even after controlling for cardiac risk factors
and admission characteristics.21 The study
results suggest that access to coronary care is not realised in proportion to need among
persons with a history of psychiatric disorders. The studies have mainly been conducted
in the USA and many of them have been based on small or regional samples or clinical
samples of CHD patients. This study contributes with a nationwide analysis of access to
coronary care and mortality, covering the total population, providing an opportunity to
study and compare outcomes in all major diagnostic groups of severe mental disorders,
including substance use disorders. The Finnish healthcare system is a good case for
examining coronary care in a universal healthcare state since the Finnish system is
funded mainly by tax revenues and based on universal access to care according to
clinical need for all residents.22


The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of equity in access to
coronary care among people with a history of severe mental disorder. We examined
coronary mortality, risk of hospitalisation and revascularisation procedures during the
last decade (1998–2009). Three groups of patients with severe mental disorders
were examined, that is, patients with psychoactive substance use disorders, psychotic
disorders and mood disorders, and compared with population without hospitalisations due
to psychiatric diagnoses. We further analysed the effects of sex and age to these
differences.

Methods
This nationwide register-based study examines the access to coronary care in
1998–2009. The study population consists of all men and women resident in Finland
and older than 40 years at the beginning of each calendar year. All hospital
discharges in 1998–2009 containing a diagnosis for CHD (ICD-10: I20-I25, I46.1,
I46.9) or severe mental disorder (ICD-10: F10-F39) were obtained from the Finnish Care
Register. The Care Register is maintained by the National Institute for Health and
Welfare and includes data for all hospital inpatient care in Finland, both public and
private. The register includes the dates for the beginning and end of each inpatient
care episode, the main diagnosis for the episode (ICD-10) and two side diagnoses, as
well as all surgical procedures.

The cohort with severe mental disorders was defined as those having a hospital care
episode at least once with main diagnosis for a psychotic disorder (ICD-10 F20-F29),
mood disorder (ICD-10 F30-F39) or substance use disorder (ICD-10 F10-F19) at any time
during 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2009. If an individual had been hospitalised more
than once and given more than one main diagnosis, we hierarchically allocated the
individual to the psychosis subpopulation if diagnosed with psychosis at least once.
Patients with main substance use related disorders and mood disorder diagnoses were
allocated to the substance use group. These persons remained in the population with
mental disorders throughout the study period because of the long natural course of the
mental disorders in question. CHD hospitalisations and coronary revascularisations among
them were compared with those of the total population without severe mental disorders.
The psychiatric population at risk was defined as the annual mean population of the
severe mental disorder cohort in each year in 1998–2009. Stratification by year,
10-year age band, sex and patient group was used. Annual mean population figures for the
whole Finnish population in 1998–2009 were obtained from Statistics Finland from
which numbers of people with severe mental disorders were subtracted to achieve the
population at risk for the non-psychiatric population. Both were followed up from 1
January 1998 or the subsequent year following their 40th birthday until the end of the
study period in 31 December 2009 or death. The age of the persons with and without
mental disorders was updated in the end of each year.

The psychiatric population comprises some 1.4 million person-years including
579 478 for substance abuse disorders, 399 909 for psychotic disorders and
440 752 for mood disorders, whereas the non-psychiatric population comprise some
27.5 million person-years over the study period. Data on coronary revascularisation were
individually extracted from the register. Data on mortality were obtained from the cause
of death statistics.23 These individual-level
data sets were linked using unique personal identifiers.

The Finnish registers have been found to be a valid and reliable tool for
epidemiological research.24–26 The
Finnish Care Register has shown good validity with regard to psychotic disorders in
general27 and even in regard to a range of
specific main mental health diagnoses, such as bipolar disorder,28 and alcohol use disorders.29


Main outcomes were RR of at least one hospitalisation for CHD, first coronary
revascularisations (coronary artery bypass grafting or coronary angioplasty) and CHD
mortality. Incidence rates and their 95% CIs were calculated for each patient group by
sex and age.

Poisson regression models were used to study differences between the patient groups in
access to coronary care. The three outcome measures in relation to person-years were
examined by patient sex, calendar year, age group, diagnostic group and the interaction
between the last two. As interactions between the diagnostic groups and age groups were
found, the RRs were calculated to assess differences between diagnostic groups in each
age group. For the total risk ratios, the analyses were performed controlling for
patient sex, calendar year, age group and diagnostic group. The analyses were performed
using SAS V.9.2.

The need for revascularisation operations was assessed using two proxies. We compared
likelihood of revascularisation against age-specific coronary mortality and risk of
coronary hospitalisations in the three groups of persons with severe mental disorders
against persons without these disorders. Ten-year age categories were used in plotting
the death rates and risks of hospitalisation against the operation rates. The study
protocol has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the National Centre for
Health and Welfare (§163/2010).

Results
There were 164 999 people with severe mental disorders in the data during the
study period of whom 67 659 were classified as having a psychosis, 47 205
as having a substance use-related disorder and 50 135 as having a mood disorder.
Those having psychotic disorders had 4991 coronary hospitalisations and underwent 568
revascularisations, those having substance abuse disorders had 8178 hospitalisations and
1823 revascularisations and those with mood disorders had 9629 hospitalisations and 1327
revascularisations. Persons without severe mental disorders had 370 452 coronary
hospitalisations and underwent 91 996 revascularisations during the study period.
Table 1 presents rates for hospitalisation
and revascularisation per 100 000 for each group of people with severe mental
disorder by age and sex. Both hospitalisations and revascularisations were more common
among men in each age group but the associations by different diagnostic groups were
similar for men and women. Persons with psychotic disorder had lower rates for both
hospitalisation and revascularisation compared with other groups with severe mental
disorders, whereas the rates were higher among persons with substance use disorders and
mood disorders compared with coronary people without mental disorders.

CHD mortality was higher among persons with severe mental disorders compared with people
without a history of a severe mental disorder (table
2). The differences in mortality risk were especially marked among persons
with disorders due to psychoactive substance use and psychotic disorders, and a pattern
of decreasing excess risk was found by age: the younger the age group, the larger the
excess mortality risk.

Overall, people with severe mental disorders had an increased risk of being hospitalised
due to CHD compared with patients without mental disorders (table 3). This was especially true for younger
(40–49 years old) persons with substance use disorders or mood disorders,
among whom the likelihood of hospitalisation was more than double compared with those
without mental disorders. A statistically significant age pattern was detected among
these two patient groups: the younger the age group, the larger the excess likelihood of
hospitalisation. In persons with a psychosis diagnosis, however, the likelihood was
similar to those without mental disorders and no age gradient was detected.

The sex-specific analyses revealed that differences were more pronounced among women
with disorders due to psychoactive substance use and mood disorders (data not
shown).

The likelihood of coronary revascularisations (table
4) was higher among 40–49-year-old persons with disorders due to
psychoactive substance use and 40–59-year-old persons with mood disorders. In
older age groups among these patient groups and among persons with psychosis, the
likelihood of revascularisation was smaller compared with persons without mental
disorders. The likelihood of revascularisation was especially low among older
(60+ years) persons with psychotic disorders among whom the RR was
approximately half of that among persons without mental disorders. We further analysed
whether the results differ by type of first revascularisation (bypass operation,
angioplasty). Since the results were similar for both types of revascularisation,
numerical results are not presented.

Age-specific revascularisation rates are plotted against age-specific coronary mortality
rates and hospitalisation rates in figure 1.
Among persons with substance use disorders, revascularisation rates were below those
found among persons without mental disorders at each level of mortality except for the
two oldest age groups (figure 1A). Among persons
with mood disorders, revascularisation rates exceeded than those found among persons
without mental disorders in the youngest age group but were lower in older age groups at
each level of mortality. Among persons with psychotic disorders, revascularisation rates
were below than those found in other groups at each level of coronary mortality. When
coronary hospitalisation was used as a proxy for need (figure 1B), the curves were similar among persons with substance use
disorders and mood disorders: at each level of hospitalisation, the revascularisation
rates were lower than those among persons without mental disorders except for the oldest
age group. The rates were especially low among persons with psychotic disorders.

Discussion
This nationwide register-based study examined equity in coronary care among the three
major groups of people with severe mental disorders in 1998–2009 in Finland
compared with people without these disorders. Three main outcomes were examined, namely
coronary mortality, coronary hospitalisation and first coronary revascularisations.
Persons with substance use disorders or mood disorders had increased likelihood of
hospital care due to CHD but not persons with psychosis. The same pattern was seen for
coronary revascularisations among young age groups. Increased hospitalisations and
revascularisations are likely to reflect the increased prevalence of CHD among people
with severe mental disorders as suggested by increased coronary mortality reported in
earlier studies.1–8
However, access to revascularisation was poorer among older persons in these patient
groups in relation to need suggested by increased CHD mortality indicating that
selective mechanisms may differ across age groups. Whereas earlier research has shown
increased CHD incidence and mortality among persons with psychotic disorders,5 corroborated by our results of increased coronary
mortality, persons with psychosis had no differences in the likelihood of hospital care
to persons without severe mental disorders. We further found selective
under-representation of people with psychotic disorders among those receiving
revascularisation interventions in all age groups. While older persons with substance
use disorders and mood disorders had poorer access to revascularisation compared with
those without severe mental disorders, the risk ratios were especially low among persons
with psychotic disorders. Selective mechanisms seem to be at work at two levels in this
patient group. First, these patients seem to have poorer access to hospital care as
compared with people with mood or substance abuse-related disorders and second, poorer
access to revascularisation.

The strength of our study was that we used nationwide, unselective representative data
concerning the total population of Finnish residents in 1998–2009 collected from
administrative registers with full coverage and based on clinical diagnoses. We were
also able to include persons with substance use disorders. The accuracy and coverage of
the Finnish Care Register has, in general, been reported to be good,23 and the accuracy of CHD data in the register has
proved to be good.25 A weakness of our study is
that persons with less severe mental disorders, who have not been hospitalised, are
excluded from the population with severe mental disorders and can therefore appear in
the population without severe mental disorders. Thus, our results are representative
only for the population with mental disorders severe enough to require hospitalisation
and rather underestimate the differences. Another weakness of our study is that we could
not control for possible comorbidities or health behaviours that could have an effect on
the differences.

Our results concerning coronary mortality, hospitalisations and revascularisation
procedures are in line with those reported from studies examining total populations of
persons with specific severe mental disorders1
9
13
14 and our results replicate especially the low
hospital admission rates and revascularisation rates among persons with psychosis in
relation to need indicated by excess coronary mortality.16 Some studies have reported no differences in hospitalisations or
revascularisations, but these studies have been based on clinical coronary populations
and not total populations of persons with severe mental disorders,30–32 whereas our study covered the total population
of persons with mental disorders severe enough to require hospitalisation. Our study
design allowed us to put the outcomes in proportion to the population at risk. Our study
further adds to the literature by examining the outcomes by age. Our results suggest
that both access to and quality of care as well as outcomes may differ by age among
persons with severe mental disorders. Additionally, studies including substance use
disorders are rare.13
33 Kisely and colleagues33 reported similar likelihood of coronary procedures among persons
with substance use disorders compared with the total population from Nova Scotia,
Canada. Lawrence and colleagues13 reported
similar admission rates, and among men similar revascularisation rates, among persons
with substance use problems compared with the general population in Western
Australia.

The register data used in our study do not enable us to evaluate whether the poor access
to coronary revascularisation according to need found in our study among people with
severe mental disorders and especially poor access to hospital care and
revascularisations among people with psychotic disorders are due to delay or avoidance
in seeking care or poorer responsiveness of the healthcare system to somatic health
problems of these vulnerable patient groups. Both may be related to stigma associated
with mental health disorders and especially with psychosis.34 Another possible explanation that can play a role in differences
in revascularisation rates are ethical and consent issues as well as contraindications
for invasive surgical procedures due to comorbid conditions or treatments. The age
gradient in access to CHD treatment points towards a role of stigma, as stigmatising
attitudes towards mental disorders are more common among older people in Finland.35 The lack of access to coronary treatment is
likely to reflect shortcomings in provision of health services and in care seeking
because of stigma associated to mental disorders in healthcare and self-stigma among
people with mental disorders interact. Those already labelled by the health services may
decide to distance themselves from the label, forgoing treatment or becoming
non-compliant.36 Our results are in line with
the high level of discrimination experienced especially by people with
schizophrenia.37


Our results suggest that even in a highly developed welfare state with an egalitarian
public health system with full population coverage, intentional or unintentional
structural discrimination of people with severe mental disorders, especially people with
psychotic disorders, occurs. The healthcare professionals need to be aware of possible
stigmatising attitudes among them and of the need for targeted measures to address the
needs for somatic healthcare among people with severe mental health problems and
especially among people with psychosis. Addressing stigma is a core component in
aspirations to reduce excess cardiovascular mortality among people with severe mental
disorders.
