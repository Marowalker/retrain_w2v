Rapid response nursing team evaluates the patients in the early stages of clinical exacerbation and prevents unexpected cardiopulmonary arrest. The present study aimed to determine the effect of rapid response nursing team in outcome of patients care in the emergency ward.

Methods
This clinical trial was conducted on 714 patients in the emergency ward in selected hospitals affiliated to Alborz University of Medical Sciences in 2013. The patients were randomly divided into a control and an intervention group. Rapid response nursing team comprised an intensive care nurse and an anesthesia technician who were in the emergency on a 24/7 basis. If the patient's clinical conditions exacerbated, they immediately attended him, evaluated his clinical condition precisely, and took necessary nursing measures for the patients in the case group, but those in the control group received the conventional treatment in the emergency ward. Patients' conditions and the measures taken for them were precisely recorded for both groups and the data were analyzed in SPSS 16.

Results
The results of the study showed that there is a significant relationship between establishing rapid response nursing team and outcome of patient care (p=0.028), reduced transfer to special care units (p=0.014) and reduced level of care in the first 24 hours of admission (p=0.001).

Conclusion
Given the results, rapid response nursing team was effective in preventing unexpected cardiovascular arrests, increased successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and reduced transfer of patients to special care units and higher levels of care.
