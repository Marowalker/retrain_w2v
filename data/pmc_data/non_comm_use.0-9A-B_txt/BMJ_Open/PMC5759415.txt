In medical organizations, nurses utilize evidence-based practice (EBP) in order to evaluate their skills, develop and implement policies and procedures, carry out effective clinical interventions, and prepare care plans to enhance positive outcomes for patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the nurses' understanding of EBP and its relevant barriers in the selected hospitals in Iran.

Methods
The present study was a descriptive- analytical research that was conducted using a cross-sectional design in order to investigate the nurses' understanding of EBP and its barriers. In so doing, 260 nurses were randomly selected from 6 teaching hospitals in Qazvin, Iran. Upton Evidence-based Practice Questionnaire and Funk et al. Barriers Scale were employed to measure EBP dimensions and the relevant barriers, respectively. For analyze of collected data, frequency distribution tables, ANOVA, and linear regression coefficient were used.

Results
According to the results of the present study, the level of the nurses' understanding of EBP was totally over the average (3.91 out of 7), and the mean practice, attitude, and knowledge/skill were respectively 4.14, 3.78, and 3.74. The total mean of the barriers was 3.07. The organizational and adopter dimensions had the maximum and minimum means, respectively. There were a significant relationships between adopter and communication with practice There were also significant relationship between the adopter and organization with Knowledge/Skills (p<0.05).

Conclusion
Administering educational programs based on needs assessment obtained from the results of the present study can lead to an improvement in the level of the nurses' knowledge about EBP. In addition, since the existing barriers influence the effective conduction of EBP, removing such barriers by creating the necessary infrastructures and supplying human, physical, and financial resources can help with the achievement of its goals.
