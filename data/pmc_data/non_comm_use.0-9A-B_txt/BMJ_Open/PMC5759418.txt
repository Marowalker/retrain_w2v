Considering that Up-to-date database is one of the well-known and reliable databases in the field of evidence-based medicine (EBM), it is expected that the referred papers in the articles are the valid ones on the topic concerned. The aim of this study was to evaluate the credibility and acceptability of the references of the Articles in the Field of Pediatrics Nutrition on Up-to-date Database based on bibliometric and altmetrics indexes.

Methods
The studied articles were retrieved from database by searching word “nutrition” in the field of “Pediatrics”. After assessing the first 100 retrieved articles, 30 articles were selected with more relevancies. In the next phase, the indexes of all 1934 references used in 30 articles, which were in the Scopus database, extracted and entered in the prepared checklist. These indicators involved bibliometrics indexes such as Citation Count, Field-Weighted Citation Impact, and Citation Benchmarking as well as altmetrics indexes like Scholarly Activity (Mendeley and CiteULike), Scholarly Activity benchmarking, Scholarly Commentary (Blogs, Reviews), Mass Media, Social Activity (Twitter, Facebook) and Social Activity benchmarking. In addition, in order to determine the validity of the journals that publish these papers, SJR, IPP and SNIP indexes were extracted from Scopus database and entered the checklist.

Results
The mean of Citation Benchmarking, Scholarly Activity benchmarking and Social Activity benchmarking with percentile of 80.5, 70 and 12.8, respectively indicated that validity of the used articles in terms of bibliometrics indexes had relatively good condition; but regarding to altmetrics indexes, in Scholarly Activity and Social Activity were in moderate and weak conditions, respectively. SJR and SNIP indexes of the journals with an average mean of 2.5 also indicated a moderate status for used journals.

Conclusion
Due to the fact that the use of articles in the scientific community allocate more importance to determine their reliability and acceptability, high ranking of this index is a positive point, but it is still necessary to increase this rank with further use of the articles in the top percentile. The gap between scientific and social indexes is very high; this also demands more assessment of high percentile articles of these indexes in order to determine the cause of this difference.
