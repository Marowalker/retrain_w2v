Amezcua-Prieto C, Martínez-Galiano JM, Salcedo-Bellido I, et al. Maternal seafood intake and the risk of small for gestational age newborns: a case–control study in Spanish women BMJ Open 2018;8:e020424. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020424.

This article was previously published with some errors.

In Table 3 in the quantity of quintiles of seafood intake (in grams), where it says:

Q1 (≤8); Q2 (8-14); Q3 (14-21.2); Q4 (21.2-29); Q5 (>29)

It should be:

Q1 (≤56); Q2 (56.1-74.0); Q3 (74.1-92.6); Q4 (92.7-121); Q5 (>121)

Considering this correction, some sections changes from the original published manuscript:

In the Abstract, in the result section, the sentence:

The risk of an SGA newborn was lower among women who consumed >29 g/day fish compared with women who consumed ≤8 g (adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98; p=0.025 for a trend).

Should be:

The risk of an SGA newborn was lower among women who consumed >121 g/day fish compared with women who consumed ≤56 g (adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98; p=0.025 for a trend).

In Abstract, in the conclusion, the sentence:

An average seafood intake of at least 29 g/ day during pregnancy, equivalent to 2–3 servings/week, reduced the risk of an SGA newborn, compared with an average seafood intake of less than 8 g/day.

Should be:

An average seafood intake of at least 121 g/day during pregnancy, equivalent to 3–4 servings/week, reduced the risk of an SGA newborn, compared with an average seafood intake of less than 56 g/day.

In the result section of the manuscript, in page 4, the sentence:

The OR of delivering an SGA newborn was lower with seafood intakes of >29 g/day (Q5; aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98) compared with intakes of ≤8 g/day (Q1; p=0.025 for this trend).

Should be:

The OR of delivering an SGA newborn was lower with seafood intakes of >121 g/day (Q5; aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.98) compared with intakes of ≤56 g/day (Q1; p=0.025 for this trend).

In the conclusion:

In summary, we found that an intake of at least 29 g/day of seafood, or at least 1 g/day of n3-fatty acids, was observed nearly two times as frequently in controls than in women with SGA newborns.

Should be:

In summary, we found that an intake of at least 121 g/day of seafood, or at least 1 g/day of n3-fatty acids, was observed nearly two times as frequently in controls than in women with SGA newborns.
