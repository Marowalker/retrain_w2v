Joyner K, Mash RJ. The value of intervening for intimate partner violence in South African
primary care: project evaluation. 
BMJ Open 2011;1:e000254.

In the first key message of the article summary box “listening” was
inadvertently omitted. The sentence should read: “Women diagnosed with IPV in
primary care perceive benefit from an intervention characterised by both empathic,
non-judgemental listening and a comprehensive approach to the clinical, mental, social and
legal aspects.” The journal apologises for this error.
