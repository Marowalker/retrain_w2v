Because of growing costs in health system, resource allocation has vital role in assignment of existing resources to health technologies in recent years. Therefore, health technology assessment (HTA) is a good tool for allocating the resources based on evidence in health sector. In line with evidence-based decision making, HTA program conducted in Iran since 2007 and in this article explores the main stakeholders in implementing the HTA program.

Methods
At the first step the researchers searched the related articles, policy documents and secondary sources to identify the range of the stakeholders in this field. Then, semi-structured interview were conducted with all stakeholder from all categories and interpret according to the principles of the qualitative content analysis.

Results
Stakeholder analysis has identified 10 main category of stakeholder (WHO, MOHME, The National Institute for Health Research, Graduates and researchers, Universities and research institutes, Department of Medical Equipment, Food and Drug Administration, Insurance agencies, Manufacturing and importer companies' of medicines and medical equipment, The Parliament Health Commission) in relation to HTA program. The MOHME and NIHR along with graduates and researchers who were educated abroad were the most powerful and supportive actors that had an important role in implementing this program. We found that Department of Medical Equipment and medicines and medical equipment companies were strongly opposition in implementing the HTA program. The presence of abroad graduates in the country at the time of implementation of the program was the most important factor in the successful implementation of this program.

Conclusion
Conducting this program showed that the dialogue with opposition groups can enhance the possibility of the successful implementation of a program. Implementing these strategies at a country level will confidently decrease the knowledge gap between research and policy and increase health system outcomes in terms of resource allocation and EBM.
