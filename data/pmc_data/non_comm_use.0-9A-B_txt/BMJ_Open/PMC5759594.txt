Complimentary medicine plant an important role in treatment of disease because of variety of usefulness. Satureja khuzestanica Jamzad is one of the plants which is used to make nanoparticles.this study aims in Preparation, characterization and in vitro biology study of Satureja khuzestanica Jamzad essential oil-loaded chitosan nanoparticles.

Method
The fabrication of Satureja khuzestanica Jamza essential oil (SKE) -loaded chitosan nanoparticles was achieved by a two-step method: oil-in water emulsion and ionic gelation of chitosan with pentasodium tripolyphosphate.

Results
The obtained particles possessed encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) in the ranges of 13–30% and 3–11.2%, respectively, when the initial carvacrol content was 1–2% of chitosan. The individual particles exhibited a spherical shape with an average diameter of 185.5 nm, and a positively charged surface with a zeta potential value of −24.3 mV. The increment of initial carvacrol content caused a reduction of surface charge. SKE-loaded chitosan nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis and S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, L. monocytogenes, E. coli, S. typhi, S. paratyphi, S. enterica, with an MIC of 62.5, 15.6, 125, 15.6, 7.8, 62.5, 7.8, 15.6, 500 µg/mL, respectively. Skin inflammation was induced in the right hind paw of rats by the topical application of 2 mg/paw of carrageenan dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.9% saline solution. The anti-inflammatory effect of the SKE-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (25, 50,100 mg/kg) were compared to diclofenac sodium (200mg/kg). SKE-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (50 mg/kg) produced significant anti-inflammatory effect (P<0.01).

Conclusion
The findings from our present study suggest that SKE-loaded chitosan nanoparticles anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. SKE-loaded chitosan nanoparticles could serve a potential novel compounds effective in inflammatory and antibacterial conditions.
