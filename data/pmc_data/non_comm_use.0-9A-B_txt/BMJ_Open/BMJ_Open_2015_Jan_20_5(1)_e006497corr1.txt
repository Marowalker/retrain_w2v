Sawhney S, Mitchell M, Marks A, et al. Long-term prognosis after acute kidney injury (AKI): what is the role of baseline kidney function and recovery? A systematic review. BMJ Open 2014;4:e006497. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006497

The reference numbers are correctly displayed throughout the manuscript and all the tables. However, the figures were published with incorrect reference numbers. The findings of the study and data presented are all correct, but the figures could be misleading/confusing in their current form. The correct figures are below.

Figure 3 Mortality—by pre-AKI baseline (AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; w/o rec, without recovery; with rec, with recovery).

Figure 4 Mortality—by post AKI recovery (AKI, acute kidney injury; CKD, chronic kidney disease; w/o rec, without recovery; with rec, with recovery).

Figure 5 CKD outcomes (w/o rec, without recovery; with rec, with recovery; ESKD, end-stage kidney disease).
