Animal bites are a significant threat to human health because of fatality of subsequent infections such as rabies. The aim of this study was to determine the epidemiology of animal bites during a five-year period in Shush County.

Methods
In a descriptive cross sectional study, all cases of animal bites referred to the health centers in Shush County were investigated during 2004–2008. The necessary data were recorded on the special questionnaire that contains questions about bite animal, age, sex, occupation, treatment, the bite site on the body and so forth.

Results
Out of a total of 2283 cases, 1771 people (77.6%) were male. Most cases were related to age groups 10–20 (33.4%). The average incidence rate of animal bite during these years was determined as 2.82 cases per 1000 people. Almost 86.5% and 13.5% of the cases occurred in rural areas and urban areas, respectively. Nearly 30% and 20.4% of cases were students and farmers, respectively. A total of 2155 (94.4%) and 86 (3.8%) bites occurred by the dog and cat, respectively. The greatest bite place on the body was in the feet (81.4%). During the study period, 2162 cases (94.7%) were treated with an incomplete regimen, and 120 cases (5.3%) were treated with a complete regimen.

Conclusion
Because the cost of prevention after biting for the health system is high, so, preventive programs must be concentrated on public health instruction, particularly in villagers, students, farmers and the owners of the domestic animals.
