Powell R, McGregor G, Ennis S, et al. Is exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation effective? A systematic review and meta-analysis to re-examine the evidence. BMJ Open 2018;8:e019656. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019656.

The author was unaware of a protocol paper that changes a couple of things in this paper. It does not change the conclusions.

In Table 1, the ‘Intention-to treat analysis conducted’ is currently listed as ‘High risk’ but should read ‘Low risk’. The ‘Support for judgement’ column for this row should read ‘Outcomes will be analysed on an intention-to-treat basis.’

In Table 2, in the ‘Santaularia et al,
29 Spain’ row, the ‘Recruitment period (years)’ currently reads ‘None specified’ but this should read ‘2010–2012’.
