Nectaroscordeum species are belong to the Alliaceae Liliaceae family which are used as ornamental flowers because of beautiful inflorescences. Leaves of nectaroscordeum koelzii and nectaroscordeum tripedale collected from west mountainous regions of Iran in the spring and used as flavorings in the preparation of a local bread. The aim of this stydy is consider the phytochemical, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-Giardia and antioxidant compounds of nectaroscordeum koelzii and nectaroscordeum tripedale.

Methods
Component were extracted using methanol as solvent extraction, separation and measurement of the two plants by gas chromatography (GC/MS) was done, phytochemical properties of extract, including antioxidants, anthocyanins, phenols and flavonoids were examined. anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of the extracts were evaluated in two ways MIC and MBC, different concentrations of the extract was used to measure anti-Giardia.

Rrsults
Most composition of essential oils of N. koelzii include: Di-El. Limonene (35/09%), beta-pinene (20/06%) and Trans-caryophyllene (11/32%), IC50 µg/ml 263/03, phenolic compounds 0/15%, flavonoid compounds 61/44% was reported, respectively. Most composition of essential oils of N.tripedale include: 2,4-decadinal (11/11%), Hexadecanoic acid(10/29%), Heptadecane(9/55%). The MIC for antibacterial and antifungal activity of extracts from both plants was variable between 625 and 10,000 per ml. In this study, the maximum power extract for anti-Giardia was at a concentration of 20 milligrams per ml. IC50 330/58 µg/ml, phenolic compounds 0/04%, flavonoid compounds 26/88% and anthocyanin was 4*10−6.

Conclusion
According to the results obtained, N. koelzii extract was more powerful than N.tripedale in biological properties, so these plants can be used as a preservative in food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics.
