Fell DB, Johnson J, Mor Z, et al. Incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza disease among infants under 6 months of age: a systematic review. BMJ Open 2017;7:e016526. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016526

In figure 2 and online supplementary table 3, Bennet (2016) are reported to have found an influenza incidence of 144 per 10 000 in infants younger than six months; however, the correct figure is a median yearly incidence 1998–2014 of 144 per 105 in this age group, which equals 14.4 per 10 000. This correct figure is among the lowest in similar settings, and considerably reduces the variability of reported incidences.
