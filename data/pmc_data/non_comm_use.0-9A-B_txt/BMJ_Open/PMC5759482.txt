to explore the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ).

Methods
In this cross-sectional study in 2015, the psychometric properties of the Persian version of the PSQ were determined by participation of 10 patients, 14 experts and 488 residents. Impact score, content validity index, content validity ratio of the items were calculated. Construct validity and reliability of the scale were examined conducting exploratory factor analysis and Cronbach's Alpha and Inter class correlation coefficient (ICC), respectively, using STATA, version 13. This research project was approved by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.

Results
Based on the findings, questionnaire had: CVI=0.94, CVR=0.84, Impact Score=4.61, Cronbach's Alpha=0.93 and ICC=0.513 (Sig.0.00). A single factor was identified according to the eigenvalue distribution of PSQ. That factor could predict about 93% of the variance.

Conclusion
Persian version of PSQ had satisfactory reliability and validity, as well as adequate feasibility based on the field results. Medical teachers and managers at every Persian-speaking country can reliably evaluate residents' communication skills, applying the Persian version of PSQ.
