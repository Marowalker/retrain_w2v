The use of EBP can provide appropriate and effective care in pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. Levels of knowledge and confidence in the ability likely related to implementation of evidence-based care. This study was carried out to investigate the level of midwifery knowledge, self-efficacy and practice toward evidence-based practice in the region east of Iran.

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in all midwives of two hospitals and health care centers in Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran in 2016. Survey instruments included the Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire and self-efficacy in Evidence-Based Practice scale. Descriptive statistics and Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficient were employed to analyze the data.

Results
The mean±SD scores of knowledge, self-efficacy and practice to implement EBP were 4.48±0.94, 3.53±0.68 and 2.80±0.81, respectively. A significant relationship were found between knowledge, self-efficacy and practice mean scores with proficiency in English language and statistical methods (p<0.05). Additionally, a highly significant relationship was found between knowledge and practice of midwives and proficiency in the use of databases (p<0.05). The midwives' mean scores in the two subscales of knowledge and self-efficacy was correlated with their scores practice toward EBP (P<0.05).

Conclusion
This survey has shown the need to improve knowledge, self-efficacy and practice to assist in employing evidence based practice. Interventions that consider the relevant factors have been identified in this study, may help to increase knowledge, self-efficacy and practice regarding EBP.
