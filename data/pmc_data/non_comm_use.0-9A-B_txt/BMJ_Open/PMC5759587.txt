See: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/An environment incorporating, in its design principles, the knowledge of human physiology and perception and especially the physiology and perception of people across the lifespan, where multi-morbidities such as frailty and Alzheimer's might occur, is beneficial for all other aspects of care and everyday life and acts as their multiplier. This project is an innovative, experimental bottom up, multi-disciplinary, user-inclusive approach that has been created as part of the call of Commitment Actions of D4 action group, of the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Active and Healthy Ageing (AHA). The aim is to create synergies between regions to identify areas of future research together with practical scalable solutions applicable to living labs/reference sites. It identifies new design paradigms, informed by end-users' opinions on the care and treatment of ageing populations and for sustaining healthy societies free of sources of structural stigma. This includes transfer of knowledge and upscaling for frailty and fall-prevention through design technologies and the integration of healthcare facilities via holistic approaches. Partners cover the whole spectrum of stakeholder involvement: academia, central government, local authorities, regulatory bodies, start-ups, end-users and user-representatives, and small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). They are multi and cross-disciplinary, including architecture, planning, IT technologies, transportation, healthcare, psychiatry, art-therapy, business administration, medical tourism and care provision. They collaborate in creating informal networks of partnerships on understanding the potential of innovation buildings, advance the state of the art through experimental and interpretative frameworks, advance the potential for scaling up and investment in successful solutions to collect, share, and disseminate promising practices to contribute to the silver economy.
