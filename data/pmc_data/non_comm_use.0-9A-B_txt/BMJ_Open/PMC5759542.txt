Local context of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) is of central importance to reduce the public health concerns like metabolic syndrome and thus designing of proper strategies to improve health in a population requires sufficient data which are scanty in Bangladesh. Therefore a project was designed an attempt to start a solution by BIRDEM and WDF (Jan 06–Aug 11). The goal was to create awareness and impact on health professionals and policy makers regarding MS absolutely from local perspective of Bangladeshi people.

Methods
The TEAM contacted each and every single institute/university/organization over the whole country to collect primary/secondary – chemical, biological and sociocultural data from research on MS. Data on about 1000 food items and 12000 socioeconomic related KAP were sum-upped, compiled and edited for database. Then a substantial volume of culturally sensitive health promotional/educational tools like followings:

▸ Publication and circulation of several health articles, magazines, calendar, Leaflets and Alphabet book.

▸ Distribution of ‘Clay-models’.

▸ Dispersion of thousands of Mini-display-boards.

▸ Training of health professionals

▸ Special Classes for patients (337)

▸ ‘Series of Dissemination Seminars’ for all (15)

▸ Launching of website www.pushti.org

▸ Broadcast of 3 mini docudramas through >12 satellite channels…. were developed.

Results
The KAP level is significantly improved after promotional activities. Benefitted people: 3000000 Patients and Relatives, 1200 Doctors, 600 Paramedics, 800 Nurses, 100 Dieticians/Educators, 60000000 Mass people. Recently this research work has been accepted in different institutes to practice further.

Conclusion
Allied persons are now giving the second thoughts to design, run or implement new endeavour focusing the key findings of this project.
