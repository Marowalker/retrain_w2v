Clarke DJ, Hawkins R, Sadler E, et al. Introducing structured caregiver training in stroke care: findings from the TRACS process evaluation study. BMJ Open 2014;4:e004473.

In the ‘Strengths and limitations of this study’ box (bullet point 3, line 3) it should not read ‘12h.’ The corrected sentence is:

The process evaluation is one of the largest conducted alongside a stroke rehabilitation trial, with over 1200 h of observation and 92 interviews.
