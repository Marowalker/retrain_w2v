For this article, an author note has been added below:

It has been noted that this publication covers the same topic as a protocol for a systematic review published by Cochrane in 2011 (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009151/full). The authors acknowledge that they were aware of the protocol and should have cited it in the article. However, the authors have stated that they developed their research question and methods independently.
