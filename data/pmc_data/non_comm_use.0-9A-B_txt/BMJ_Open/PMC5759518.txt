Bronchoscopy training based on virtual reality simulators are being used increasingly but effectiveness remains uncertain. The aim of this study is to perform a systematic review of published works on virtual reality bronchoscopy training.

Methods
We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for eligible articles from first of January 2000 to 15 May 2016. We included all original articles involving virtual reality Bronchoscopy training performed by flexible and rigid Bronchoscopy. Study selection and data abstraction were performed separately. Novices and experts were trained and comparisons of trained novices with novices (Group A), trained experts with experts (Group B), and trained novices with experts (Group C) were performed. Pooled results were analyzed by random effect meta-analysis.

Results
From an initial pool of 2831 articles (179 Scopus, 32 PubMed, and 2620 Google Scholar) we identified eight studies relating virtual reality Bronchoscopy training based on simulation. The results of forest plots of meta-analysis in group A is Hedge's g=1.038, SE=0.271, Z-value=3.825, P-value=0.000, and in group B is Hedge's g=0.820, SE=0.283, Z-value=2.928, P-value=0.003 and group C is Hedge's g=–0.652, SE=0.219, Z-value=–2.975, P-value=0.003. P-values of all Groups are significant and virtual reality training is effective in these groups. Heterogeneity and Egger's regression tests were also performed in all groups.

Conclusion
Virtual reality Bronchoscopy training based on simulation would help to improve technical skills if theoretical knowledge acquisition designed as a learning instrument. This meta-analysis assessment seems to be valid and reliable.
