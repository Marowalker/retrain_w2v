The current survey aims at determining the frequency percentage of Prophylaxis usage against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) according to ACCP instruction among the patients hospitalized in Imam Khomeini teaching hospital in Ilam.

Methods
This study is descriptive and retrospective and the sampling was carried out amongst the cases of patients who were hospitalized and operated in the period occurred in March of 2012 to September of 2013 in Imam Khomeini hospital in Ilam. The type of receiving Prophylaxis was determined by ACCP (The American College of Chest Physicians) Guidelines. After investigating the input and output criteria, patients' data were extracted according to the dependent variables. Eventually the information gathered from the cases were analyzed by SPSS software version 17.

Results
Studying 169 qualified cases from which 46.2% (78 participants) were female. Showed that from 132 patients needed to receive Prophylaxis only 39 persons (29.5%) were given Prophylaxis and according to ACCP Guidelines with respect to the appropriate type, dose, and duration of thromboprophylaxis was operated in only 30 individuals (22.5%) completely. The maximum rate of thrombo-prophylaxis happened to be in ICU (46.6%) and neurosurgery section (47.5%) and the least utilization of that was in the kidney and urinary tract section (0%).

Conclusion
This study shows that there are a considerable difference in clinical performance recommended by ACCP in prophylaxis against DVT and in 75% of patients endangered by DVT, thrombo-prophylaxis according to ACCP Guidelines was not operated. Thus, new strategies must be implemented to operate thrombo-prophylaxis against DVT in Ilam hospitals.
