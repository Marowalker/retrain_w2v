Haemovigilance is defined as the surveillance of adverse reactions occurring in donors and in recipients of blood components. A surveillance system for transfusion-related adverse reactions was started in 2010 in Iran. From 863 hospitals in Iran, 542 center runs (63 percent). The ultimate purpose of haemovigilance is to prevent the repetition of adverse events and reactions.

Methods
According to national haemovigilance guideline, the training course for the target group was held. First, pretest from the target group was taken and after theoretical and practical training, posttest was taken. After the Six months of training, test was performed again and using statistical methods, the test results were analyzed.

Results
From all of the target groups, the educational haemovigilance system was implemented to 75 percent and the average of pre-test in nine different sections was 15.2 and after training, the mean was 18.96 which represent an increase 18.8 percent in training course. The results show that the haemovigilance system is effective in hospitals.

Conclusion
Haemovigilance is an effective tool for identifying adverse effects of blood components. Increased knowledge of haemovigilance among physicians and nurses can lead to improved transfusion safety. Efforts to identify and eliminate the complications associated with blood transfusions and improve them, to reduce the death rate, infection and reduce the amount of disability, health promotion and ultimately the patients' satisfaction enhancement. The most important factor in the success of haemovigilance system is cooperation and coordination between hospitals and blood centers.
