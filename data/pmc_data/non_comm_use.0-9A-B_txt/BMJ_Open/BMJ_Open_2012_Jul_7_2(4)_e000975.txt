The objective was to test the hypothesis that the risk of stroke, death and the
composite of ‘stroke and death’ would be increased among patients
with incident heart failure (HF). While HF increases the risk of mortality, stroke
and thromboembolism in general, the ‘extreme high-risk’ nature of
incident HF is perhaps under-recognised in everyday clinical practice.

Design
Prospective cohort study.

Setting
Large Danish prospective epidemiological cohort.

Participants
Subjects in the Diet, Cancer and Health study.

Outcome measures
Stroke, death and the composite of ‘stroke and death’ among patients
with incident cases of HF, without concomitant atrial fibrillation.

Results
From the original cohort, 1239 patients with incident HF were identified.
Incidence rates show a higher incidence in the initial period following the
diagnosis of HF, with a markedly higher rate of death and stroke (ischaemic or
haemorrhagic) in the initial 30 days following the diagnosis of incident
HF. While lower than the risk at 0–30 days, the higher risk did not
return to normal at 6+ months after the diagnosis of incident HF.
This risk increase was apparent for the end points of stroke (ischaemic or
haemorrhagic or both) whether or not a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) was used. With
VKA use, there was a lower adjusted HR for death and the composite of
‘death or stroke’ compared to non-VKA use at the three time
intervals following diagnosis of HF, whether 0–30 days,
30 days to 6 months and 6+ months. On multivariate analysis,
previous stroke/transient ischaemic attack/thromboembolism was a predictor of
higher risk of stroke, death and the composite of ‘stroke and
death’, while VKA treatment was a highly significant predictor of a lower
risk for death (adjusted HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.74, p<0.001) and the
combined end point of death or stroke (adjusted HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.96,
p=0.003).

Conclusions
Based on relative hazards, incident HF is clearly a major risk factor for stroke,
death and the composite of ‘stroke and death’, especially in the
initial 30 days following initial diagnosis. The use of VKA therapy was
associated with a lower risk of these end points. These findings would have major
implications for the approach to management of patients presenting with incident
HF, given the high risk of this population for death and stroke, which may be
ameliorated by VKA therapy.

Article summary
Article focus
While HF increases the risk of mortality, stroke and thromboembolism in
general, the ‘extreme high-risk’ nature of incident HF is perhaps
under-recognised in everyday clinical practice.

We tested the hypothesis that the risk of stroke, death and the composite of
‘stroke and death’ would be increased among patients with
incident HF.

Key messages
Incident HF is clearly a major risk factor for stroke, death and the composite
of ‘stroke and death’, especially in the initial 30 days
following initial diagnosis.

The use of VKA therapy was associated with a lower risk of these end
points.

These findings would have major implications for our approach to management of
patients presenting with incident HF, given the high risk of this population
for death and stroke, which may be ameliorated by VKA therapy.

Strengths and limitations of this study
Our ‘real-world’ study focused on incident HF, this reflects the
new development of ‘clinically significant’ HF requiring the need
for hospital case contact.

Some deaths could be due to undiagnosed stroke, and some patients with HF could
have undiagnosed AF, where the benefits of VKA therapy on stroke and mortality
have been clearly shown in clinical trials.

The incidence of stroke was defined by the Danish National Patient Register,
and not all stroke end points were defined by cerebral imaging.

The choice of VKA therapy was non-randomised and could be biased by a selective
preference for VKA therapy and variance in use over time.
==== Body
Introduction
Heart failure (HF) is a major healthcare burden and is increasing in incidence and
prevalence.1 Despite efforts with various
pharmacological interventions, mortality and morbidity remain high in patients with this
common condition.

When associated with atrial fibrillation, the presence of HF is also associated with a
higher risk of stroke and thromboembolism.2
However, the impact of HF per se, in the absence of atrial fibrillation, on stroke and
mortality is less clear. Recent cohort data suggest that the risk of stroke and
thromboembolism is greatest in the initial period (<30 days) following the
diagnosis of HF, although the risk may still be evident until 6 months.3 Indeed, postmortem studies suggest that many sudden
deaths in HF have an aetiology related to thromboembolism.4 Even studies from >50 years ago suggest that anticoagulation
with warfarin may have an impact on mortality and thromboembolism, while the benefits of
antiplatelet therapy are less evident.5
6 While antithrombotic therapy has limited impact
on mortality in contemporary trials,7 there is
some evidence that warfarin reduces the risk of HF hospitalisations and
thromboembolism.2

We hypothesised that incident HF would predict the risk of stroke, death and the
composite of ‘stroke and death’. To test this hypothesis, we analysed data
from a large Danish prospective cohort, the Diet, Cancer and Health (DCH) study, to
assess the RR of stroke and/or death according to the exposure to incident HF with no
concomitant atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, among participants who developed HF, the
predictors of stroke and/or death were explored.

Methods
The DCH study cohort was established between 1993 and 1997. The study design has been
reported in detail elsewhere.10 The primary
objective of this prospective study was to investigate the aetiological role of diet and
lifestyle in the development of cancer, and 57 053 participants were enrolled
(27 178 men and 29 876 women, respectively) in the cohort. The study
participants were aged between 50 and 64 years, living in the urban areas of
Copenhagen and Aarhus, and without a cancer diagnosis registered in the Danish Cancer
Registry at baseline. Participants were, for this study, followed from January 1995
until December 2009. The DCH cohort has detailed information on demographics, existing
comorbidities and individual risk factors, including myocardial infarction (MI) and
peripheral artery disease (PAD). Cross linkage between the DCH cohort and the Danish
National Patient Register provides detailed information on incident HF,
stroke/thromboembolism (TE) and death and specific information about censoring from
emigration and death during follow-up until December 2009. The study was conducted in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration II and approved by the regional ethics
committees.

Case finding
The DCH cohort subjects were linked to the National Registry of Patients, dating back
to 1976, using the Danish Personal Identification number. This is a unique and
national identification number, which is part of the personal information stored in
the Civil Registration System.

Codes from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) were used to extract
admissions for baseline clinical diagnoses from the Danish National Patient
Register,11 stroke end points, AF and HF.
ICD-8 was used until 1994 and replaced by ICD-10 thereafter. The ICD codes used are
given in web only table X1. Information on drug use was extracted from the Danish
National Prescription Registry.12 Drug
categories and ATC codes used are listed in web only table X. Based on the
prescription information on amount and time lap between individual prescriptions
treatment periods were estimated for each subject and drug.

Study subjects were selected from the DCH cohort following the criteria as described
in figure 1, which were essentially DCH
participants without selected cardiovascular diseases before study entry. Two sets of
data were created. The first set was used for estimating the risk for an outcome if
exposed to an incident HF event. The second set was used for investigating potential
risk factors for an outcome if having experienced a HF event.

Outcomes
We determined our outcomes as stroke, death or ‘death and stroke’
during follow-up. Given the nature of the data set, some deaths could have been due
to (undiagnosed) stroke, and the coding of ‘stroke’ refers to all
strokes, consistent with recommendations on outcomes in AF studies.13 Rehospitalisation for HF was considered in a
subanalysis. Rehospitalisation was defined as a subsequent re-admission to hospital
with HF. Re-entry should be at least 4 days from discharge and should not be
within a treatment period where the patient was seeing regularly the hospital for
ambulant control for HF.

Statistical methods
Descriptive analysis with proportions for discrete covariates and means and SDs for
continuous covariates was used to describe the baseline distributions (ie, at time of
entry into DCH cohort and at HF diagnosis). HF exposure was analysed both as a
constant effect, from the time of incident HF event, and as a piecewise constant
effect, allowing for a separate hazard rate in the periods: 0–1, 1–6
and 6+ months after incident HF event. Incidence rates of the outcomes
were calculated for each level of the exposure groups. Cox proportional hazards
models with age as time scale were used to estimate the HRs for HF exposure and
reported as crude and adjusted measures of association. Primary adjustment was
vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment modelled as a time-varying covariate. The
analysis was further adjusted for sex and systolic blood pressure (linear effect) as
confounders. Linearity assumption for systolic blood pressure was tested by fitting
alternative models using fractional polynomials.14 Test for VKA treatment acting as an effect modifier was performed by
likelihood ratio tests. The risk factor analysis was performed using a Cox
proportional hazards model with time since HF event as time scale. Included a priori
defined risk factors were, age >75 at HF event, sex, previous stroke (stroke,
transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or TE), known hypertension, previous vascular
diseases (coronary artery disease, PAD, DVT, PE or MI) and restrictive
cardiomyopathy. All risk factors were analysed and the results reported as crude
measures of association and as measures adjusted for VKA treatment. Eventually, a
multivariate model with all risk factors including VKA treatment was estimated. VKA
treatment was included as a time-varying covariate. The prognostic value of the risk
factors was investigated by calculating c-statistics as area under the ROC curves
using the method of Heagerty et al
15 to account for censored survival data. The
reported c-statistics are averages of 200 cross-validations using 75% of the data for
estimation balanced for sex and the remaining for validation. Rehospitalisation rate
was estimated as the cumulative incidence rate from a competing risk survival
analysis, treating death as a competing risk. A p value <0.05 was considered
as statistically significant. Stata/SE V.12 was used for data analysis.

Results
Patient characteristics are summarised in table
1. Of the original cohort of 51 553 subjects without prior HF or AF, we
identified 1239 patients with incident HF (figure
1). Patients with HF were older, more likely to be male and had more
comorbidities (previous MI, coronary artery disease, PAD, hypertension, diabetes and
thyroid disease). Mean blood pressure at baseline was also higher among HF patients.
Drug therapies were different between HF patients and the non-HF subjects and may partly
reflect their associated comorbidities.

Incidence rates (per 100 person-year) of death and stroke for HF and for three periods
after HF are shown in table 2. This clearly
shows the higher incidence of death and stroke in the initial period following the
diagnosis of HF, with a markedly higher rate of death, stroke (ischaemic or
haemorrhagic) in the initial 30 days following the diagnosis of incident HF
(figure 2A,B). While lower than the risk at
0–30 days, a higher risk was also observed at 6+ months
after the diagnosis of incident HF.

This higher risk was apparently independent of VKA use for the end points of stroke
(ischaemic or haemorrhagic or both) (table 3).
VKA use was associated with a lower mortality and a lower combined end point of
‘death and stroke’.

In some individuals, both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke may occur, while in
‘all stroke’ only first event (whether ischaemic or haemorrhagic)
is counted. In the combined end point analysis, we model the association
between the outcome events and the status of HF exposure and vitamin K
antagonist (VKA) treatment without distinguishing between the type of stroke
(ischaemic or haemorrhagic). Constant effect of HF exposure: crude: no
adjustment, model 1: adjusted for VKA treatment, model 2: adjusted for VKA
treatment, sex, systolic blood pressure. All models use age as time scale.

* Effect modification term added to the model. Test for effect modification is a
likelihood ratio test between main effects model and model with interaction
term. Expected risks are calculated as in the multiplicative model.

The time interaction is shown in table 4. With
VKA use, there was a lower adjusted HR for death and the composite of ‘death or
stroke’ compared with non-VKA use at the three time intervals following diagnosis
of HF, whether 0–30 days, 30 days to 6 months and
6+ months (table 4).

Table 5 shows univariate and multivariate
predictors for end points in patients with incident HF. Based on the multivariate model,
the c-statistics were only modest at 1 year (death 0.57, stroke 0.68 and
‘death or stroke’ 0.60) and 10 years (0.56, 0.57 and 0.60,
respectively). On multivariate analysis, previous stroke/TIA/TE was positively
associated with stroke, death and the composite of ‘stroke and death’,
while VKA treatment was a highly significant predictor of a lower risk for death
(adjusted HR 0.46, p<0.001) and the combined end point of death or stroke
(adjusted HR 0.56, p=0.003).

Discussion
In this large ‘real-world’ cohort study, we demonstrate a significantly
greater risk of mortality and/or stroke in the initial 30 days after diagnosis of
incident HF and also show that previous stroke/TIA/TE was an independent predictor of
mortality and adverse outcomes (stroke) among these patients. In addition, we show that
VKA use was associated with statistically significant lower risk of ‘death or
stroke’, which was most apparent in the first 30 days after the diagnosis
of incident HF.

Unsurprisingly, patients with HF were older and had more comorbidities, in keeping with
previous epidemiological studies. Of note, average systolic blood pressure at baseline
was also higher among patients with incident HF, consistent with epidemiological
observations of a strong association between HF and hypertension.16


While HF increases the risk of mortality, stroke and thromboembolism in general, the
‘extreme high-risk’ nature of incident HF is perhaps under-recognised in
everyday clinical practice. Our data in this large cohort study very clearly show a
higher incidence of death and stroke in the initial period following the diagnosis of
HF, with a markedly higher rate of death, stroke (ischaemic or haemorrhagic) in the
initial 30 days following the diagnosis of incident HF. This confirms recent
observations from the Rotterdam study,3 which
showed that the risk of ischaemic stroke was more than fivefold higher in the first
month after diagnosis of HF (age and sex adjusted HR 5.79, 95% CI 2.15 to 15.62) but
attenuated over time (age and sex, adjusted HR 3.50 (95% CI 1.96 to 6.25) after
1–6 months and 0.83 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.29) after
0.5–6 years). Our data extend several previous studies of short follow-up
that reported a higher risk of stroke shortly after the diagnosis of HF.17–19 Most of these studies did not
adjust for possible confounders other than age and sex or were based on hospitalised
patients only. In contrast to the Rotterdam study, the association was still present
even at 6+ months after the diagnosis of incident HF.

With VKA use, we found a significantly lower adjusted HR for death and the composite end
point of ‘death or stroke’ compared with non-VKA use. While recent
contemporary clinical trials in stable HF patients have suggested that VKA therapy does
not impact on mortality, there was a significant reduction in secondary trial end points
such as stroke.7
20 In the recently published WARCEF trial,20 the rates of the primary outcome (ischemic
stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or death) were not significantly different between
warfarin and aspirin treatment groups (hazard ratio with warfarin, 0.93; 95% CI 0.79 to
1.10; P = 0.40), although ischaemic stroke was significantly reduced (and major
bleeding increased) with warfarin. In a time-varying analysis, the hazard ratio changed
over time, slightly favoring warfarin over aspirin by the fourth year of follow-up, for
the primary endpoint (P = 0.046).20 The
present cohort includes patients with incident HF, who are clearly at much higher risk
than those with stable prior HF. Of note, historical trials of anticoagulation in HF did
suggest a beneficial effect on mortality and stroke, although these trials are
considered to be less robust by contemporary standards.5
6 Also, the use of oral anticoagulation in acute
medically ill patients, including the subset of patients with HF, did reduce stroke but
with a significant increase in risk of bleeding compared with placebo.21


The possibility remains that some patients with incident HF have incident (and
undiagnosed) atrial fibrillation, which is a well-recognised cause of higher mortality,
stroke and TE that is significantly reduced by VKA therapy.22
23 Indeed, the presence of HF adds to a higher
risk of stroke and is incorporated into contemporary stroke risk stratification schemes
for AF.24 The development of atrial fibrillation
may be asymptomatic and could have contributed to episodes of incident HF.

We found that on multivariate analysis, previous stroke/TIA/TE was a predictor of higher
risk of stroke, death and the composite of ‘stroke and death’, while VKA
treatment was a highly significant predictor of a lower risk for death and the combined
end point of death or stroke. The predictive value of risk factors derived from the
multivariate analysis was modest, with c-statistics approximately 0.60—this would
reflect the multifactorial nature of HF and the many comorbidities that could impact on
outcomes, as well as treatment options (eg, ACE inhibitors, devices, etc), which could
not be considered in our study. Our observation would also suggest that development of a
simple risk stratification score (similar to those seen in atrial fibrillation) would be
difficult, and even so, a (potentially complicated) multivariable risk equation derived
from a multivariate analysis may not even have good predictive value in HF
populations.

Nonetheless, our study shows that incident HF patients with prior stroke represent a
very high-risk category of patients, who could be targeted for oral anticoagulation,
given the potential reduction in mortality shown by the present analysis. This
hypothesis would need to be tested in a clinical trial of patients with HF who have
prior stroke, who may benefit from aggressive thromboprophylaxis.

Limitations
Some deaths could be due to undiagnosed stroke, and some patients with HF could have
undiagnosed AF, where the benefits of VKA therapy on stroke and mortality have been
clearly shown in clinical trials.22 One small
study using ambulatory ECG monitoring did show that patients with systolic HF did
have a high prevalence of asymptomatic arrhythmias, including AF.25 Also, the incidence of stroke was defined by
the Danish National Patient Register, and not all stroke end points were defined by
cerebral imaging. Indeed, silent strokes may be quite prevalent in HF patients.26 Also, the choice of VKA therapy was
non-randomised and could be biased by a selective preference for VKA therapy and
variance in use over time. Indeed, this cohort study is not a randomised trial, and
patients may be treated with multiple drugs for varying periods of time, at different
doses and by multiple clinicians.

We also did not have detailed data on HF by the New York Heart Failure Association
class (although this would clearly vary over time and with treatments), but since our
study focused on incident HF, this reflects the new development of ‘clinically
significant’ HF requiring the need for hospital case contact. Finally, we have
used a clinical coding diagnosis of HF, and thus, we did not have echocardiographic
or biomarker (eg, BNP) data to confirm the proportions with systolic HF or those with
HF and preserved ejection fraction. While the latter patients have better mortality
outcomes than those with systolic HF, the morbidity appears to be similar with
similar rates of ischaemic stroke, rehospitalisation or progression to New York Heart
Association class III–IV.27


Conclusions
Incident HF is a major risk factor for death and/or stroke and especially in the
initial 30 days following initial diagnosis. Previous stroke/TIA/TE was
associated with a higher the risk of stroke, death and the composite of
‘stroke and death’, while VKA treatment was associated with a lower
risk for death and the combined end point of death or stroke. These findings would
have major implications for our approach to management of patients presenting with
incident HF, given the high risk of this population for death and stroke, which may
be ameliorated by VKA therapy.
