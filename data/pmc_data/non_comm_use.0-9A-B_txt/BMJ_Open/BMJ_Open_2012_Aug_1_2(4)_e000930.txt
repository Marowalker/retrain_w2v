Reducing emergency admissions is a priority for the NHS. A single
hospital's emergency care system was reorganised with the principles of
front-loaded investigations, integration of specialties, reduced duplication,
earlier decision making by senior clinicians and a combined emergency assessment
area. The authors relocated our Medical Assessment Unit into our emergency
department in 2006. The authors evaluated changes in admissions and mortality
before and after 2006, compared with other similar hospitals.

Design
Quasi-experimental before and after study using routinely collected data.

Setting and participants
1 acute hospital in England, the intervention site, was compared with 23 other
English hospitals between 2001 and 2009.

Outcome measures
Our outcome measures were hospital standardised mortality ratios (HSMRs) for
non-elective admissions and standardised admission ratios (SARs).

Results
The authors observed a statistically and clinically significant decrease in HSMR
and SAR. The intervention hospital had the lowest HSMR and SAR of all the
hospitals in our sample. This was statistically significant, p=0.0149 and
p=0.0002, respectively.

Conclusion
Integrating emergency care in one location is associated with a meaningful
reduction in mortality and emergency admissions to hospital.

Article summary
Article focus
We describe the improvements that occur when a medical admissions unit is
closed and relocated into an emergency department. We compared a single unit to
a family of similar hospitals. We used routine data analysed by the Dr Foster
healthcare intelligence unit.

Key messages
Reducing duplicate processes, centralising hospital emergency care in one area
and streamlining non-elective admission pathways is associated with sustained
reductions in non-elective admissions and mortality.

The Standardised Admissions Ratio is an effective way to measure the
performance of non-elective admissions.

Strengths and limitations of this study
This study has compared performance against controls over a ten year
period.

The study uses retrospectively analysed administrative data.
==== Body
Introduction
There have been large increases in the number of emergency department attendances and
emergency admissions over the past 10 years, policy initiatives have largely been
ineffective at reducing this.1 Emergency
admissions now cost the NHS £11 billon a year.2
3 In addition, emergency admissions disrupt
elective care.1 Secondary emergency care systems
have evolved rather than developed by any planned process. While it has always been
recognised that a part of an acute hospital needs to accessible for unplanned
emergencies, there is less consensus on the optimal organisation of unplanned emergency
care. Emergency care systems vary widely across the world and even within countries and
between hospitals in different countries. An emergency department can be seen as having
an advanced triage role, identifying and treating ill and injured while discharging
safely the well. An ideal, publicly funded, hospital emergency care system would save
lives, reduce morbidity while minimising admissions to hospital. The degree of
investigation and management before admission varies widely. Medical Admissions Units
(MAUs), where general practitioners (GP) can refer patients directly to a general
physician, are common throughout the UK. Surgical Admission Units, where general
practitioners can refer patients directly to a surgeon are also common. Patients
referred to these admission units usually bypass emergency departments. These admission
units also receive referrals from the hospital emergency department. In the UK, around
50% of all emergency admissions to hospital pass through the emergency department.

While this model of care is well understood by healthcare staff, it results in long
delays for definitive treatment and fragmented care. Patient may undergo multiple
assessments if they pass through an emergency department and are then subsequently
admitted to an assessment unit. Many bed moves result, which compromises infection
control and continuity of care. In 2004, we embarked on a service redesign of the
emergency assessment and admission process. We mapped out admission pathways for
patients who were admitted non-electively. We sought to remove wasteful steps and
duplication. It was apparent that the process of admitting general medical patients (the
majority of non-elective admissions) to our hospital was fragmented, inequitable,
complex and had multiple, duplicated steps. We found that patients often passed through
two assessment areas, had documentation on two separate medical records, had blood tests
repeated and might be assessed by up to five different doctors.

We opened the Emergency Assessment Unit (EAU) in 2006. The two diagrams show the process
for admitting or discharging the majority of emergency patients presenting to our
hospital. This was broadly similar to admission process in most acute hospitals in the
UK before 2006 and radically different afterwards. We redesigned the service, so that
the majority of non-elective admissions attended the emergency department. In 2006, we
closed our MAU and relocated the staff to the emergency department. We expanded the
emergency department by about the number of beds that the MAU had had. We developed a
combined clerking process that was supported by shared documentation, with the overall
aim of reducing assessments (figures 1 and 2). The emergency department was supported by the
development of the short stay medical and surgical wards, a clinical decisions unit and
a children's observation unit. These wards aimed to look after patients for no
more than 3 days. There was an increased access to emergency radiology. The
proportion of non-elective admissions entering the hospital through the emergency
department rose from about 50% to around 80%. Patients requiring admission from the
outpatient department, referrals from other hospitals and obstetric patients continued
to bypass the emergency department. We did not use an explicit theoretical or scientific
framework to guide us, but our approach had elements of lean manufacturing techniques in
that we performed value stream mapping of patient pathways.4 Our approach differed from ‘lean’ in that there was a
‘big bang launch’, and there was less emphasis on continuous improvement
in this program than a ‘lean model’.

Previous small-scale evaluations identified that this model of care was associated with
a reduction in admissions and hospital standardised mortality.5
6 However, these studies were compromised by short
follow-up times and an absence of meaningful controls. We aimed to evaluate whether our
model of care was associated with reduced admissions and inpatient mortality, compared
with other similar hospitals. Our outcome measures were hospital standardised mortality
ratios (HSMRs) for non-elective admissions and standardised admission ratios (SARs). We
anticipated, based on previous work, that our admissions ratios would be lower, but we
aimed to evaluate against similar hospitals.

Methods
Addenbrookes is a teaching hospital in Cambridge, England. The emergency department sees
around 90 000 patients per annum. We compared this hospital's performance
with a family of most similar hospitals trusts. These were mainly teaching hospitals
trusts outside London. This family of hospitals are frequently compared for operational
performance. These 15 acute trusts are identified in box 1, comprising 23 emergency departments.

We conducted a retrospective evaluation using Dr Foster's data. This is a
healthcare intelligence unit that analyses data from all the hospitals in the NHS. We
evaluated HSMR for non-elective admissions over the years immediately before and after
implementation of our integrated emergency care model in 2006. HSMR is a performance
measure used widely throughout the NHS and has high face validity. HSMR is the ratio of
the observed number of inhospital deaths during admissions with an HSMR diagnosis to the
expected number of deaths, multiplied by 100. The expected number of deaths is
actuarially based on a number of conditions with a predictable rate of death, including
heart failure, strokes and fractured neck of femur. We ran the model with and without
adjusting for socioeconomic deprivation. This made no practical difference to our
results or conclusions, so we have reported the results without adjusting for
socioeconomic deprivation. HSMR is reported throughout the NHS. HSMR is calculated for
non-elective admissions regardless of whether they are admitted through an assessment
unit or emergency department. We benchmarked our performance against the relevant
financial year. We have previously developed a measure called the SAR with the Dr Foster
unit.7 The numerator is the number of
non-elective admissions. The denominator was the total number of patients registered in
GP practices that refer 80% or more of their patients to an included hospital. This was
then compared with a national average to provide a ratio. We benchmarked our SAR against
the relevant year. We analysed data from 2001 to 2009. We conducted the analysis in the
summer of 2011, as this allowed enough time to ensure that all the hospitals had
provided complete returns and that all long stay patients had been discharged.

We contacted emergency medicine consultants working in all the other hospitals to
establish whether their non-elective admissions to medicine or surgery were admitted
through their emergency departments.

We used the method described by Palmer8 to perform
hypothesis testing on the rank performance of our hospital from 2006 onwards. A
statistical analysis specifically designed for post hoc assessment of routinely
collected data was applied to assess the plausibility of chance for accounting for
observed differences in hospital care emergency care system performance measures after
the policy change was implemented. In this natural experimental setting, two key rates
were separately analysed to assess performance. We did not seek ethical approval as this
was a service evaluation using routinely collected anonymous data.

Results
We received complete data from all the hospital trusts that we contacted for information
about the organisation of their emergency care services. The Dr Foster unit provided us
with complete data sets on all the acute hospital trusts that we had identified as most
similar to us. No hospital other than Addenbrookes routinely received GP-referred
medical patients in their emergency department during the study period. Three emergency
departments, in addition to Addenbrookes, routinely received GP-referred surgical
admissions.

The SAR decreased suddenly in 2006 when the EAU opened and was the lowest of all the
hospitals in the sample in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 (table 2). The probability one prespecified hospital out of 16 performs
consistently best across all 4 years is highly statistically significant, with
p=0.0002 (figure 3).

Figure 3 Standardised admissions ratio: Emergency Assessment Unit model versus similar
hospitals.

There was a steady decrease in our HSMR, compared with controls during the study period
(table 1). This decrease began in 2003. This
was maintained and was the lowest of all the hospitals in the study in 2007, 2008 and
2009. The probability that the intervention hospital performed best out of 16 hospital
trusts 3 out of 4 years is statistically significant, p=0.0149 (figure 4). We adjusted both SAR and HSMR for
deprivation but found that the effect of this was minor and did not change our
conclusions. The three hospitals that directed GP-referred surgical patients to the
emergency department had similar performance to the other hospitals that had Surgical
Admission Units.

Figure 4 HSMR for non-elective admissions: Emergency Assessment Unit model compared to
other similar hospitals.

Discussion
We have found that the combining an MAU in the emergency department has been associated
with a beneficial and sustained decrease in HSMR and SAR. We found that the HSMR started
decreasing 2 years before the EAU opened. We found that GP-referred surgical
admission units being co-located in emergency departments had little effect on HSMR or
the numbers of admissions. This is not surprising as the numbers of non-elective
surgical admissions and subsequent deaths are considerably lower than in patients
admitted under general medical specialties.

We propose that this model of integrated emergency care allows an emergency department
to fulfil its primary role of an advanced triage facility better, in that admissions are
minimised safely and mortality declines. We speculate that there several reasons for
reduced non-elective admissions. Many GP-referred low acuity conditions, such as
suspected venous thromboembolism were attending an MAU and were counted as an admission.
These patients are now rarely admitted. We think that this benefits these low acuity
patients as they are usually discharged within 4 h. We also think that this
benefits the health economy, as these patients are treated more cheaply. Access to
advanced imaging, such as ultrasound and CT, improved as part of this model and this
allows earlier discharge.

There are some important limitations to our work. The data were routinely collected and
subject to significant variability. HSMR only presents data about patients who have been
admitted to hospital, not those attending the emergency department. It is possible that
our decline in HSMR might be offset by more people dying in the emergency department or
dying at home. We think that this is unlikely. HSMR is an imperfect measure to assess
quality of care in hospitals.9
10 However, the use of HSMR to identify
comparative trends, as we have, is less controversial. Acute hospitals in the England
are obliged to report these data for performance management and follow a standard
reporting system.

It is possible that the changes we saw in SAR may be due to changes in the way primary
care is organised locally. We think that this is unlikely; first, we are unaware of any
major changes in the way that GPs refer patients to the hospital, second, there was a
big decrease just after the EAU opened, consistent with a causal relationship. We cannot
ascribe a causal relationship to the changes that we have seen with our study design, a
natural experiment design only allows description of associations.

The measure of admissions, SARs, can be criticised in that we had to develop a new
measure. However, other performance measures available are designed for emergency
departments and not the whole emergency care pathway. This measure of admissions is
superior to other measures, such as conversion rate, as it provides information about a
whole acute care system performance, rather than an individual department.

The 4 h target was introduced during the study period. This is a performance
measure that mandates that 95% of patients need to have left the emergency department
within 4 h of arrival, with financial penalties for non-compliance. This could be
a potential confounding variable; however, it was applied equally to all the study
hospitals.

This work comes from a single centre and care should be taken in generalising the
results to other hospitals; however, the principles of reduced fragmentation and
duplication of care that we have described are intuitively plausible. We have described
a complex intervention, and it is difficult to be sure what parts of the intervention
have lead to a beneficial response. Our study design, a natural experiment, does not
allow us to state that our model causes the reduced admissions and mortality. However,
combining care from multiple specialty teams, front-loading investigations, improving
access to investigations and reducing duplication reduces admissions and mortality is
plausible and seems to have a temporal, specific and strong effect. We did not use an
explicit theoretical framework or scientific method to develop our model of care. Our
approach had elements of lean manufacturing principles, but we had to be pragmatic.

We did have not presented an economic analysis of these data, this an area of future
work. However, this model of care provides benefits to the whole health economy.

There is little literature that we could find about system redesign to reduce emergency
hospital admissions. Most interventions are condition or presentation specific, such as
falls in the elderly or frequent attenders.1
11
12 Other studies assess the effect of general
practitioners working in, or close, to the emergency department or walk-in centres.13–15 These have reported
inconsistent or minor effects, at best. There is some evidence that early assessment by
experienced doctors and nurses in an emergency department reduces emergency
admissions.16–18 There is a
large literature that examines how to improve processes within an emergency department,
but little of this measures patient-orientated outcomes.19–24 Future work should attempt to
validate these findings across different hospitals.

Conclusions
Combining emergency admissions within one place is associated with significant and
beneficial reductions in mortality and admissions. This model of integrated emergency
care may allow emergency departments to fulfil their advanced triage function
better.
