Modern societies include increasing proportions of elderly people, with a resulting increase in the incidence and duration of chronic illnesses. Quality of life (QOL) has recently been explored as one of the main outcomes of renal replacement therapy. Since Iran's policy is that patients on hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis driven, so in this study, we sought to compare two groups of patients hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) with regard to QOL in dialysis centers of Shiraz, Iran 2013, also QOL in patients undergoing (HD) and (PD) were compared with the QOL of Iranian society.

Methods
In this cross-sectional study, QOL was analyzed in 35 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients (Census sampling method) compared with 60 hemodialysis (HD) patients matched as closely as possible to the PD patients regarding age, gender, education, and occupation. All groups were asked to estimate their subjective QOL by responding to socio demographic data and the Short-form 36 (SF-36). Data were analyzed via SPSS21 software using descriptive and analytical statistics (Frequency, Percent, Mean and Standard Deviation, T-test, multivariate regression analysis and Chi-square) with regard to the significant level of 0.05.

Results
The total sample of 95 patients consisted of 43 males (45.3%) and 52 females (54.7%), with a mean age of HD patients 54.9±14.9 and PD patients 52.6±15.5. Rating physical problems in HD group 1.75±7.99 and in PD group 27.94±38.32 there was a significant difference in the two groups (P<0.001). Total dimension of the physical QOL Under the influence of variables the type of dialysis (P<0.001) hypertension (P=0.043) and total dimension of the mental QOL Under the influence of variables the type of dialysis (P<0.001) hypertension (P=0.040) and age (P=0.024) were.

Conclusion
Although the quality of life both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients was lower than the general population but in all aspects in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis had a better quality of life. So the health care team can use this information to education and encourage them to choose PD treatment efforts to extend patients' life satisfaction.
