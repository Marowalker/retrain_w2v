Noble D, Smith D, Mathur R et al. Feasibility study of geospatial
mapping of chronic disease risk to inform public health commissioning. BMJ
Open 2012;2:e000711. In the section
‘Strengths of this study’ it was reported that only one data field (family
history of diabetes) contained a significant proportion of missing data.  In
fact, this variable is only recorded if positive and therefore it cannot be said whether
or not it has a significant proportion of missing data.
