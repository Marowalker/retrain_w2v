Iyngkaran P, Tinsley J, Smith D, et al. Northern Territory Heart Failure Initiative—Clinical Audit (NTHFI—CA)—a prospective database on the quality of care and outcomes for acute decompensated heart failure admission in the Northern Territory: study design and rationale. BMJ Open 2014;4:e004137. On page 9 of this paper (Discussion section) the copy editor mistakenly defined eGFR as ‘epidermal growth factor receptor’. This is not correct; the correct term is, ‘estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)’. In addition, in figure 2 of this paper parts A,B,C,D should have been labelled 1,2,3,4 so as to correspond correctly with the illustration.
