Basit A, Fawwad A, Qureshi H NDSP Members, et al. Prevalence of diabetes, pre-diabetes and associated risk factors: second National Diabetes Survey of Pakistan (NDSP), 2016–2017. BMJ Open 2018;8:e020961. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-020961.

The previous version of this manuscript contains incorrect versions of figures 2 and 3 in the published article. Figures 2 and 3 should appear as:

Figure 2: Age-stratified prevalence of diabetes among men and women with urban and rural distribution

Figure 3: Age-stratified prevalence of pre-diabetes among men and women with urban and rural distribution

The following related text should read as:

Urban women showed significantly higher prevalence of diabetes than rural women above the age of 40 years while in men this trend was seen in the age group of 60 years and above (p<0.05) (figure 2).

Relating to figure 3, the following text should read as:

Urban men showed significantly higher prevalence of pre-diabetes than rural men for the age group of 60 years and above while for women significant difference was seen in urban compared with rural population for the age groups of 40-49 and 60 years and above (figure 3).
