The reliability of questionnaire was determined by calculating the Cronbach's alpha coefficient.

Results
Great number of students indicated clinical librarian's mission is to facilitate access to quality information that is necessary for improving health.

Clinical librarian programs may deliver patients specific information in a timely manner.
