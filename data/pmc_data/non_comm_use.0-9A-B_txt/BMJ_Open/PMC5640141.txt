The authors’ original interpretation of the data presented in the article by Marin et al (2013) was incorrect.1 2 The authors inadvertently included only patients with clinical exam evidence of abscess, instead of all patients that had point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). As a result, the revised numbers for the article by Marin et al (2013) would be True Positive 193, False Positive 37, False Negative 27, True Negative 95.2 The subsequent diagnostic accuracy of POCUS in this study would be altered to a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 72%. Incorporating these results into the final meta-analysis, the revised point estimates for the diagnostic accuracy of POCUS would be sensitivity 95.5% (95% CI 88.9-98.3) and specificity 80.3% (95% CI 56.4-92.7). The original findings of the meta-analysis were sensitivity 96.2% (95% CI 91.1% to 98.4%), and specificity 82.9% (95% CI 60.4% to 93.9%).1 The authors thank Marin et al for bringing this discrepancy to their attention.
