Uptake of healthcare among migrants is a complex and controversial topic; there
are multiple recognised barriers to accessing primary care. Delays in presentation
to healthcare services may result in a greater burden on costly emergency care, as
well as increased public health risks. This study aimed to explore some of the
factors influencing registration of new entrants with general practitioners
(GPs).

Design
Retrospective cohort study.

Setting
Port health screening at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, primary care.

Participants
252 559 new entrants to the UK, whose entry was documented by the port
health tuberculosis screening processes at Heathrow and Gatwick. 191 had
insufficient information for record linkage.

Primary outcome measure
Registration with a GP practice within the UK, as measured through record linkage
with the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) database.

Results
Only 32.5% of 252 368 individuals were linked to the PDS, suggesting low
levels of registration in the study population. Women were more likely to register
than men, with a RR ratio of 1.44 (95% CI 1.41 to 1.46). Compared with those from
Europe, individuals of nationalities from the Americas (0.43 (0.39 to 0.47)) and
Africa (0.74 (0.69 to 0.79)) were less likely to register. Similarly, students
(0.83 (0.81 to 0.85)), long-stay visitors (0.82 (0.77 to 0.87)) and asylum seekers
(0.46 (0.42 to 0.51)) were less likely to register with a GP than other migrant
groups.

Conclusions
Levels of registration with GPs within this selected group of new entrants, as
measured through record linkage, are low. Migrant groups with the lowest
proportion registered are likely to be those with the highest health needs. The UK
would benefit from a targeted approach to identify the migrants least likely to
register for healthcare and to promote access among both users and service
providers.

Article summary
Article focus
Previous studies have suggested that access to health services for refugees and
asylum seekers is difficult.

There are limited data on access to primary care among other migrant
groups.

This study aimed to explore some of the factors influencing registration of new
entrants with GPs.

Key messages
Our study indicates that less than a third (32.5%) of new entrants who are
eligible for tuberculosis screening at ports register with a GP.

Registration rates need to be improved by targeting resources to particular
subgroups (eg, students and asylum seekers) and increasing awareness of
eligibility for primary care among both migrants and GPs.

Strengths and limitations of this study
Previous studies have largely focused on asylum seekers and refugees, whereas
we examined a range of migrant groups.

Primary care registration uptake may have been underestimated for those who
migrated to Scotland or Northern Ireland, although these individuals
represented only a small proportion (2.7%) of our data set.

Port health services only screen entrants from countries with a high incidence
of tuberculosis; thus, our results are not generalisable beyond these
countries. However, these populations are likely to represent those with the
greatest health needs.
==== Body
Introduction
The Office of National Statistics estimates that 567 000 migrants were documented
as entering the UK for a year or more between January and December 2009 and
575 000 between January and December 2010.1
2 During this time period, the top eight non-UK
countries of birth of migrants remained the same: India, Poland, Pakistan, Ireland,
Germany, South Africa, Bangladesh and the USA.3
4 Although the majority of new entrants to the UK
are likely to be young and healthy, certain groups are at higher risk of infectious
diseases. The risk of communicable and chronic diseases differs by country of origin, so
primary care services need to tailor individual care to the conditions that each new
entrant is most likely to suffer from. Ensuring that new entrants to the UK access
healthcare services while resident in the country is essential to avoid delayed
treatment of transmissible conditions, which can impact upon the health of population
groups with social or domestic contact with new entrants.

Certain forms of healthcare are provided free to all entrants, including immediately
necessary treatment from Accident and Emergency departments or walk-in centres,
treatment for certain communicable diseases, family planning services and compulsory
psychiatric treatment.5 Furthermore, general
practitioners (GPs) may, at their discretion, register all persons who apply to
them.5 However, not all those entering the
country will access the services available as a result of uncertainties surrounding
their entitlements, a perceived lack of need for healthcare or fears about an overlap
between health and immigration services.6
7 Cultural and linguistic barriers can also have
detrimental effects, but problems with access may also be service provider related,
particularly as recent migrants may be perceived to be greater than average primary care
users.6
8
9 Delayed access, for whatever reason, may shift
the burden of care onto inpatient and emergency services, often at a greater expense
than primary and secondary outpatient care.10
11 A lack of registration with primary care
provides a barrier to being referred to other healthcare services and limits exposure to
the health promotional resources often found in GP surgeries.

We sought to explore the factors that influenced registration with primary healthcare
services using a data set of individuals screened by port health teams at Gatwick and
Heathrow airports for tuberculosis between June 2009 and November 2010, linked to the
Personal Demographics Service (PDS). Identification of the factors that influence
registration could lead to (1) better targeting of awareness-raising efforts designed to
encourage new entrants to register upon entering the UK and (2) improved knowledge among
healthcare providers of the rights of new entrants to register. Ultimately, promoting
earlier presentation to healthcare services may save NHS resources.

Methods
We undertook a retrospective cohort study, following STROBE guidelines.12 A database of all individuals screened for
tuberculosis by chest x-ray at Gatwick or Heathrow port health services between 10 June
2009 and 10 November 2010 (252 559 records) was linked to the PDS database
(August 2011) of NHS registrations in England and Wales. Thus, the most recent migrants
in our data set had a minimum of 9 months to register in order to be found in the
PDS. Individuals were selected for screening as they were subject to immigration
controls into the UK, staying for more than 6 months and from a country with high
rates of tuberculosis. Individuals are subject to immigration control if they are not
nationals of the UK, Ireland, Channel Islands, Isle of Man, another country in the
European Economic Area or Switzerland and also have not been given permission to stay as
refugees or a permanent right to remain.13 The
Demographics Batch Service undertakes the automatic linking of records to the PDS by
first name, surname, gender and date of birth. The potential for the reversal of first
names and surnames during record compilation was compensated for by linking both fields
to each other. Exact linking of names, gender and dates of birth that is not sensitive
to case is performed. Spaces and punctuation are included in the linking traces. Records
with multiple links were included in the data set as single linked records, as we
required a yes/no linking outcome. Eighty-two thousand one hundred and fifteen records
were linked and 170 253 not linked; 191 records had insufficient information for
linking.

The outcome of interest was registration with a GP practice. Exposure variables included
age, gender, nationality, immigration status and year of entry. These variables were
collected by the port health team at the time of screening from the individual and their
travel documents. The nationality of individuals was classified into world regions by
WHO standards. When ‘UK–Europe’, ‘UK–Hong
Kong’ or ‘UK–India’ was recorded, individuals were
classified into the same categories as other European nationals, individuals from Hong
Kong or India, respectively. Four age groups were created: 16 and under (children),
16–30 (young adults), 30–65 (adults) and 65 or more (older individuals). A
single immigration variable was generated from visa information—entrants were
divided into students and their dependants (collectively ‘students’),
refugees/asylum seekers/detainees and their dependants (collectively ‘asylum
seekers’), long-stay visitors and ‘other’, which in the majority
represented individuals entering with work visas and their dependants.

Generally, few variables were missing; the greatest proportion was in the nationality
field (4.0% of 252 368). Univariate analysis was undertaken and a stepwise
forward technique (predefining gender and age) used to assess which variables to include
in the final model. All variables were significant and thus included. Age was
non-linear. Sensitivity analysis was carried out on 2009 data alone, excluding
detainees, or excluding individuals in the ‘other’ category who were not
clearly designated as having a work visa or being a dependant of someone who did.
Analysis was undertaken in STATA V.11 (StataCorp).

Results
Of the 252 559 original records of individuals screened by port health
tuberculosis services, 191 (0.08% of 252 559) were excluded due to having
insufficient data for linking, leaving 252 368 for the descriptive analysis
(82 115 linked and 170 253 not linked). Ten thousand nine hundred and
fifty records had missing information, thus 241 418 were included in the
regression model (79 206 linked and 162 212 not linked).

Of the new entrants screened for tuberculosis who met our inclusion criteria, the
majority were men (56.7% of 252 368), between 16 and 30 years of age
(71.0% of 252 368), of Southeast Asian nationality (48.3% of 252 368) and
students or their dependants (65.4% of 252 368) (table 1). The gender and age distributions seen in our data were
similar to those documented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in 2009 and
2010, albeit with more males in their teens and early twenties in 2009.14 This may reflect the differing criteria for
defining an immigrant between the two studies—a 6-month stay is required for
screening by the port health service and 12 months by ONS. Very few new entrants
were asylum seekers or their dependants (1.2% of 252 368).

Less than a third (32.5%) of the 252 368 individuals analysed were linked to the
PDS, suggesting low levels of registration with a GP within this study sample. A higher
proportion of women were linked than men (36.5% of 109 391 and 29.5% of
142 977, respectively) (table 2). A
greater proportion of individuals who entered in 2009 had registered than those who
entered in 2010. Individuals of a nationality from the Americas had the lowest
proportion linked of all the world regions (table
2). The age group with the lowest proportion linked was the over 65s (23.6% of
1376). Asylum seekers and their dependants had the lowest proportion linked of all the
migrant groups (19.1% of 3071).

As year of entry was associated with registration in the multivariable model, reflecting
the fact that individuals entering the UK in 2010 had less time to register, sensitivity
analysis was performed solely on 2009 data. This multivariable analysis demonstrated
similar trends, confirming the validity of our conclusions. The system for detainees to
access healthcare may be different from that of other individuals within the asylum
seeker category, thus sensitivity analysis excluding them from the data set was also
undertaken. These individuals made up a very small proportion of the overall linked data
set (0.5% of 252 368); exclusion did not appreciably alter our findings. Finally,
exclusion of individuals not clearly designated as having a work visa or as dependants
of individuals with work visas from the ‘other’ category of immigration
status also did not significantly alter our conclusions.

Discussion
Principal findings and comparison with other studies
Although there is a body of literature on the barriers to accessing healthcare among
refugees, asylum seekers and detainees,15–20 relatively little has been
published on access among migrants who do not fit into these categories.6
8
21
22 European and global reviews of migrant
access to healthcare, although often hampered by difficulties comparing between
countries, have provided a varied picture, but have recommended assessing the impact
of immigration status and ethnicity, as well as instigating policies that adequately
respond to these differences.9
23–26


We linked data from the port health tuberculosis screening service between June 2009
and November 2010 to the PDS in order to explore some of the factors influencing
registration with GP practices. Our results showed that only 32.5% of 252 368
individuals had registered. The proportion of migrants registered in this study is
very low compared with other estimates of registration among migrants. For example,
the Patient Register Data Service provided by NHS Connecting for Health compiles
yearly data on Flag 4s for ONS. Flag 4s mark an individual who has registered with a
GP in England and Wales as previously living overseas. This includes UK nationals
whose previous address was outside the UK and non-UK nationals entering the England
or Wales for the first time. From August 2009 to July 2010, 622 178 Flag 4s were
registered in England and Wales; 572 000 long-term (for more than a year)
migrants entered the UK between July 2009 and June 2010.27
28 Thus, during similar time frames, ONS data
suggest that there were comparable numbers of new entrants and new registrants with a
previous overseas address. This might indicate that registration of new entrants is
generally high and is in distinct contrast to our data. However, in comparison to ONS
data, we have sought to link the records of individuals entering the country directly
to GP registrations. Additionally, the individuals included in this study were from a
particular section of new entrants (those screened for tuberculosis) who are
nationals of countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. The two apparently
conflicting indications may therefore be compatible, that is, registration of new
entrants may be generally high, but much lower in certain at-risk groups. Indeed, a
proportion of those with Flag 4s are UK citizens who have lived abroad (or are
nationals from high-income countries), thus their inclusion with non-UK-born migrants
may mask underlying trends. Approximately 15% of long-term migrants to the UK are
known to be British.28


Furthermore, although linking may underestimate the number of identical individuals
in both databases, this should be a more accurate method than simply counting
registrations, as indicated by recent research.29 Previous studies that have surveyed a cross section of GP registrations
among users of other healthcare services have indicated higher levels of GP
registration (68.8%–89.2%), likely reflecting a greater time spent living in
the UK and increased health-seeking behaviour.21
22 The low level of GP registration found in
this study is particularly interesting, given the relatively broad access to primary
healthcare currently available for most migrants to the UK, albeit at the discretion
of the practitioner.

The study is unable on its own to provide a satisfactory explanation for its findings
but they may be, in part, related to the nature of the selected study group. The
individuals screened may represent a population less aware of their healthcare rights
in the UK who face service-related barriers to access at the local level, including
the variable methods used by GP practices to identify and register overseas visitors
versus individuals who are ordinarily resident.8 Cultural and linguistic factors might also play a part for both users
and service providers, and some migrants might be disinclined to engage with health
services because of concerns related to their immigration status.6
7 In this study, those of male gender, from
Africa or the Americas or over 65 years of age were much less likely to
register, as were students, and asylum seekers and their dependants. Men are
generally recognised to be lower users of primary healthcare than women.30 Differences by world region may reflect
expectations of the UK health system, based on previous experiences in an
individual's country of origin. Younger migrants (eg, students, who had an
average age in our data set of 24 years) might also be expected to have a
lower registration rate associated with a reduced need for healthcare. Indeed, the
‘healthy migrant’ effect, hypothesising that only the healthiest
individuals migrate, has been well described.31–33 Young individuals may additionally delay registration until
they have a need for healthcare. However, the lowest rates of registration in this
study were in people over 65 years, who might be expected to have the highest
healthcare needs. Previous studies have documented that elderly migrants are just as
likely to access a GP as their British-born counterparts, but did not specifically
select recent entrants.34 Other studies have
noted that refugees and asylum seekers are frequently not registered with a GP.21


Limitations
In discussing the implications of our results, some limitations of the study need to
be considered. The PDS records registration with the NHS in England and Wales, thus
individuals registering in Scotland and Northern Ireland will not have been linked.
However, only 2.7% (6848 of 252 368) of new entrants registered an intended
address outside England and Wales, so the impact is likely to be minimal. A
destination address was missing for 30.7% of records (77 574 of
252 368), but 32.3% of these were linked during our analysis, that is, an
almost identical proportion to the overall linking rate. Our data will not include
undocumented migrants, who represent the most vulnerable proportion of the new
entrant population and who are the least likely to gain access to services. This will
have likely led to an overestimate of the proportion of total migrants registered. On
the other hand, nationals of high-income countries are unlikely to have been included
in this study (although some Western Europeans were screened), which would may have
biased the results in the opposite direction. Our results will also not include
short-term ‘health tourists’, although these visits may present only a
minimal economic burden.35 Service data show
that not all eligible new entrants are screened, partly due to the variable caseload
at screening facilities (which may have resulted in selection bias towards certain
groups of migrants), for example, during the peak season for student entry. Notably,
port health services screened 165 658 individuals between July 2009 and June
2010, that is, 29% of the migrants charted by the ONS.28 It should be noted, however, that long-term migrants enter for at least
12 months by ONS standards, but entry for 6 months or more results in
eligibility to be screened.

Our results are not generalisable beyond entrants from countries with high
tuberculosis incidence (usually low- and middle-income countries). Nevertheless,
these are likely to be the very populations with the highest healthcare needs. A
study on the same data set, but restricted to migrants entering between June 2009 and
September 2010, has demonstrated that <0.5% had screening results suggestive
of active tuberculosis.36 As this is a very
small proportion of our data set, it is unlikely that these individuals would have
biased our results by increasing the likelihood of their registration due to concerns
surrounding their health.

Individuals entering in 2010 will have had less time to register than their
counterparts in 2009. To ensure that our analysis was not biased by the relatively
short time frame available for registration following arrival in the UK, we performed
a sensitivity analysis using 2009 data alone, which gave very similar results (with a
small increase in the proportion of people registered, from 30.7% of 150 713
in 2010 to 35.3% of 101 655 in 2009). We excluded individuals for whom
migration status was unknown. Sensitivity analysis was also performed to exclude
detainees, who may have variable routes to access healthcare, and individuals not
clearly designated to have had a work permit or as the dependant of someone who did.
Neither of the analyses appreciably altered our results. Inevitably, the linking
process will not have perfectly identified all the individuals who registered for
care due to incorrect recording of personal details. Using a linking technique that
did not rely on exact links may have improved our results. However, both during port
health screening and upon registering with a GP, individuals are likely to have
presented a form of identification; reading these documents should have reduced the
likelihood of typographical errors. Nevertheless, even if linking only succeeded in
identifying 50% of those registered, our results would suggest that a large
proportion of migrants in the particular risk group studied do not access primary
care services. It would be instructive to determine how long individuals took to
register and what initiates registration, but this information was not available.
Furthermore, registration with a GP indicates an intention to access healthcare
services but not the extent of that access; ultimately, healthcare use can be a more
significant indicator.

Implications of findings
While we are unable to determine from this study the reasons why certain groups of
migrants have low registration rates, we might hypothesise that this is likely to be
due to a combination of patient- and service-related factors. The UK would benefit
from a targeted approach to identify the migrants least likely to register for
healthcare and promote their access among both users and service providers. However,
registration is only the first step for adequate provision of healthcare.6 Supporting practitioners is particularly
crucial, especially given the autonomy of GPs in registering patients. The Health
Protection Agency maintains a free to use online Migrant Health Guide, which brings
together a range of guidelines, information and resources that a busy practitioner
looking after migrant patients can access during a standard consultation.37 It provides detailed information on a
country-specific basis so that practitioners can tailor healthcare to the needs of an
individual patient and assists practitioners in performing an expanded ‘new
patient check’.38


If new entrants do not register for primary care, they are not exposed to the
awareness-raising and case-finding campaigns that often target specific vulnerable
population groups via GP surgeries. Screening programmes in primary care have proved
successful for tuberculosis and may be extended beyond pilot studies for post-entry
screening for latent infection and active disease.39 Case finding could also be undertaken for other infectious diseases,
such as HIV and hepatitis C, as well as conditions such as diabetes. Delayed
diagnosis of HIV, rates of which will be high in many of the countries of origin of
the new entrants included in this data set, has been shown to significantly shorten
life expectancy.40 Clearly case-finding
interventions will be ineffective, and excessively costly, if the majority of
migrants are not registered for primary care services and thus cannot be
approached.

Conclusions and future research
By improving the access of migrant patients to primary healthcare delayed
presentation, transmission risks and the burden on emergency services should be
decreased. Further research on the mechanisms that best improve the proportion of
migrants registering with GPs and the speed with which they do would be advantageous,
for example, prospective cohort studies of publicity surrounding welcome health
checks, lists of GP practises provided by local councils, employers or after
successfully receiving a visa.41 Furthermore,
the effect of highlighting the eligibility rights of new migrants with GP practices
(eg, via the Health Protection Agency's Migrant Health Guide),37 in order to ensure that migrants are not
erroneously turned away by active or passive discrimination, should be trialled.8 Such research could inform international
governments of mechanisms to ensure that they operate the ‘migrant-sensitive
health policies’ that the World Health Assembly called for in 2008.42
