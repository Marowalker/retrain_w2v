G6PD deficiencies is a genetically issue that is noticed and is wide spread in our region and around the world. Despite the screening program for this disease since 2005 there are noticeable cases.

Methods
In this descriptive study the file of 923 patients that were diagnosed with Favism and hospitalized in Khorramabad hospitals during 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. This information includes the number of occurrence for each year, the causes of new cases which analyzed and recorded.

Conclusion
Even so the cases reduced from 102 at 2005 to 33 at 2015 (60% reduction) but the most case were on 2009 and 2013 with 102 case and 145 case respectively. The cause of developing of these case is under observation and consideration. The most noticeable causes of occurrences are misunderstanding of the parents from permanent nature of disease (63.0%), neglecting disease (12.0%), Lack of providing of screening results to parents (12.0%) and use of Oxidant agents without parental supervision (8.0%), use of wrong Oxidant medication (5.0%).
