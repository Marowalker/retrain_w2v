To determine utilisation of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP);
incidence of inpatient admissions for complications occurring within
30 days of ERCP and risk factors for procedural-related complications, in a
population-based study.

Design
Retrospective cohort study.

Setting
Olmsted County, Minnesota.

Participants
All adult residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, who underwent ERCP from 1997 to
2006.

Interventions
Diagnostic and therapeutic ERCPs were assessed.

Primary and secondary outcome measures
Patient and procedural characteristics and complications within 30 days;
and rates of ERCP utilisation and unplanned admissions and risk factors for
admissions.

Results
In 10 years, 1072 ERCPs were performed on 827 individual patients. Average
utilisation of ERCP was 83.1 ERCPs/100 000 persons/year, with an increase
from 58 to 104.8 ERCPs/100 000 persons/year over time, driven by increases
in therapeutic procedures. Within 30 days after 236 procedures, 62
admissions were definitely related to the index ERCP. The complication rate was
5.3%, including pancreatitis (26, 2.4%), infection/cholangitis (16,
1.5%), bleeding (15, 1.4%) and perforation (4, 0.37%). 30-day
mortality was 2.4%, none of which was directly related to the ERCP or
complications thereof. Risk factors identified through multivariate analysis to be
associated with adverse events included: age <45 years
(p=0.0498); body mass index ≥35 (p=0.0024); pancreatic duct
cannulation (p=0.0026); outpatient procedure (p<0.0001);
intraprocedure sphincterotomy bleeding (p<0.0001); difficulty grade
(p=0.115) and patient's first ERCP (p=0.0394).

Limitations
Retrospective study.

Conclusions
Population utilisation of ERCP rose during the study period, specifically in
therapeutic procedures. Admissions within 30 days of ERCP are common but
often unrelated. Complications of ERCP remain infrequent and deaths quite
unusual.

Article summary
Article focus
Owing to the increasing use of quality metrics, accurate measures of
utilisation and procedural adverse event (AE) risks are necessary to establish
benchmarks for quality, and are best determined from community-based
studies.

There are no reports of community-based utilisation of ERCP in the USA.

The aims of this population-based study were to determine the utilisation of
ERCP including changes over time, the incidence of inpatient admissions for AEs
within 30 days of ERCP and risk factors for procedural-related AEs.

Key messages
Population utilisation of ERCP in Olmsted County, Minnesota rose over the
10-year period from 1997 to 2006, driven specifically by increases in
therapeutic procedures. The most common indications for ERCP were therapy of
choledocholithiasis and to determine aetiology of acute pancreatitis.

Admissions within 30 days after ERCP are common, but are usually
unrelated. Complications of ERCP remain infrequent at 5.3% and no deaths
were directly related.

Risk factors associated with AEs from ERCP include younger age, BMI ≥35,
pancreatic duct cannulation, outpatient procedures, intraprocedure
sphincterotomy bleeding, difficulty grade and patient's first ERCP.

Strengths and limitations of this study
Population-based epidemiological research can be conducted in Olmsted County
because medical care is virtually self-contained within the community.

The unique advantage of our data is that Mayo Clinic is the only centre
performing ERCP in the entire county, and therefore population-based
utilisation and AEs of ERCP with full details of procedures and subsequent
hospitalisations can be assessed.

The study is a retrospective review with inherent potential biases.

The skills of the endoscopists are most likely at a higher level than those of
endoscopists in smaller community hospitals. Therefore, the AE rate in this
community setting could be lower than one would expect in other community
settings.

Background
Since its first description in 1968, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) has become an established modality for the diagnosis and treatment of
pancreaticobiliary disorders.1
2 Over the years, ERCP has evolved from a purely
diagnostic to a mainly therapeutic procedure. Around 500 000 ERCPs are performed
annually in the USA with adverse event (AE) rates between 4% and 10%,3 and mortality between 0.05% and
1%.4–7 The most common
AEs following ERCP include pancreatitis, haemorrhage and infection, which occurred in
4% to7% of procedures.3
6
8 There is an increased risk of AEs after
therapeutic procedures and in patients with suspected Sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction.6 Since ERCP is an endoscopic
procedure with the highest cost and AE rates, diagnostic ERCP is now avoided in favour
of other diagnostic modalities such as less-invasive endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and
non-invasive MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).2
3
9 In an era of increasing utilisation of quality
metrics, accurate measures of utilisation rates and procedural AE risks are necessary to
establish meaningful benchmarks for quality, and are best determined from
community-based studies.

There are no reports of community-based utilisation of ERCP in the USA, but there are
several from Europe.8
10 Published reports of ERCP-related AEs have all
been single-centred or multicentred studies from tertiary care centres and affected by
referral bias, leading to high estimates of risk that may not apply to the general
population. All AEs of procedures performed at tertiary care centres may not be captured
since the patients may seek care for AEs closer to their homes and thus be lost to
follow-up.

The aims of this population-based study were to determine (1) the utilisation of ERCP,
including changes over time; (2) the incidence of inpatient admissions for AEs within
30 days of ERCP and (3) risk factors for procedural-related AEs among residents
of Olmsted County, Minnesota over a 10-year period from 1997 to 2006. The findings of
this study are unique, as they represent population-based estimates of utilisation and
risks associated with ERCP and may serve as more accurate and clinically meaningful data
for clinical decision-making and development of quality benchmarks.

Methods
Study design
A retrospective cohort study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional
Review Board of Mayo Clinic in compliance with federal regulations of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services for protection of human subjects and the
Health Information Protection and Portability Act. All patients provided consent for
medical record review. Billing records from Mayo Clinic and associated hospitals were
queried for Olmsted County residents who had undergone an ERCP during a 10-year
period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2006. ERCPs were identified using CPT codes
for ERCP, including 43260, 43261, 43262, 43263, 43264, 43265, 43267, 43268, 43269,
43271, 43272 and 47999. Utilisation characteristics for EUS were determined in the
same population using codes 43232, 43238 and 43242 and for MRCP using codes 74181,
74182 and 74183. Patients also had to be age ≥18 years, live in Olmsted
County and have valid authorisation to review medical records for research purposes
in accordance with Minnesota State statutes.

Population-based epidemiological research can be conducted in Olmsted County because
medical care is virtually self-contained within the community. Olmsted County
comprises over 100 000 persons, of whom 85% are Caucasian and
50% are women; sociodemographically, the community is similar to the US
population. Over half of the county's population is seen at one of the Mayo
Clinic facilities; 95% of local residents will have had at least one medical
contact with a local care provider (eg, for dental x-rays, sports physical
examinations, pre-employment examinations, minor illness and routine medical care)
during any 4-year period.11 Mayo Clinic has a
common medical record system with its two affiliated hospitals (Saint Mary's
and Rochester Methodist) for 90 years. Mayo Clinic's single record
system contains both inpatient and outpatient data. The diagnoses and surgical
procedures recorded in these records are indexed. It includes diagnoses made for
outpatients seen in office or clinic consultations, emergency room visits, and
diagnoses recorded for hospital inpatients, autopsy examinations or on death
certificates. The unique advantage of our data is that Mayo Clinic is the only centre
performing ERCP in the entire county, and therefore population-based utilisation and
AEs of ERCP with full details of the hospitalisation can be assessed.

Medical records were reviewed retrospectively by the primary author. Patient and
procedural characteristics, as well as AEs within 30 days, were recorded. As
many as 170 variables were collected for each procedure and recorded into a
database.

Primary outcomes measured were (1) utilisation rates of unique ERCP procedures in the
adult population (age 18 years and older) of Olmsted County from 1997 to 2006,
and (2) the rate of unplanned admissions within 30 days following ERCP for
ERCP-related AEs. Secondary outcomes included patient and procedural characteristics,
predictive of having an unplanned admission within 30 days after ERCP for an
ERCP-related AE.

Utilisation metrics included the patients’ age, sex, race, Charlson score at
the time of ERCP,12 body mass index (BMI),
cholecystectomy within 30 days prior to ERCP, altered anatomy (including
gastrojejunostomy, Whipple anatomy, hepaticojejunostomy and choledochojejunostomy),
presence of cirrhosis and previous history of ERCP. Indications for ERCP were then
examined as biliary versus pancreatic, diagnostic versus therapeutic and graded for
complexity using the previously published Morriston Hospital ERCP grading scale
(table 1).13 Diagnostic procedures had a CPT code of 43260
where no intervention was performed, other than a cholangiogram or pancreatogram; all
other procedures were therapeutic. Multiple intraprocedural details, including the
presence of a trainee, type and amount of sedation used, and biliary and pancreatic
ductal interventions were noted. Success of the procedure was recorded as the ability
to cannulate the intended duct and achieve the intended therapy.

Table 1 Morriston Hospital ERCP grading scale13

ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; PTC, percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography.

AEs recorded included unplanned admissions; sedation-related events, including
pulmonary and cardiovascular events; infection; pancreatitis; bleeding; perforation;
need for repeat endoscopic procedure or mortality within 30 days. These
outcomes were determined as being related to the index ERCP by author review. AEs
were deemed to be definitely related, probably related, possibly related or
definitely unrelated to the index ERCP. Possibly related AEs included patients
admitted with abdominal pain, but without evidence of definite pancreatitis by
laboratory studies or documented cholangitis. Probably related AEs included biliary
or pancreatic stent dysfunction leading to a repeat of the procedure within
30 days of the index procedure, but without any of the defined AEs of
pancreatitis, infection, perforation and gastrointestinal bleeding. The latter AEs
were categorised as mild, moderate and severe, according to established consensus
criteria (table 2)6
14 Patients undergoing elective surgery
including cholecystectomy within 30 days of ERCP were also identified.

Statistical analysis
Univariate analyses were performed to obtain descriptive statistics for patient and
procedural characteristics. Annual incidence was determined by dividing the number of
ERCPs performed on the study subjects during a calendar-year by the adult population
of Olmsted County during that period, according to County records and normalised to
100 000 persons. To test for associations between patient and procedural
characteristics and ERCP-related AEs, values of these characteristics were compared
between participants who experienced ERCP-related AEs and participants who did not by
two sample t tests for continuous variables, and χ2 test for
discrete variables. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine
patient and procedural characteristics predictive of ERCP-related AEs. p Values less
than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. All analyses for this
study were conducted using SAS statistical software (SAS V.9.1 for Windows; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Results
Demographic characteristics
In the 10-year period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2006, 1072 ERCPs were
performed on 827 individual adult residents of Olmsted County. The total number of
ERCPs carried out during this time period was 13056 including the non-residents of
Olmsted County. Patient demographic characteristics can be seen in table 3. Prior to the index
cholecystectomy, 232 (28%) patients had a previous cholecystectomy; 21
(2%) patients had altered anatomy and 20 (1.9%) were taking clopidogrel
or warfarin at the time of ERCP. There were 153 patients who had more than one ERCP
during the 10-year period, and the mean number of ERCPs in these patients was
1.3.

Utilisation characteristics
Average utilisation of ERCP was 83.1 ERCPs/100 000 persons/year, with an
increasing trend in utilisation from 58 to 104.8 ERCPs/100 000 persons/year
over the 10-year period. Therapeutic ERCPs increased over the same time frame from
42.9 to 93.9 ERCPs/100 000 persons/year (average 68.7). However, diagnostic
ERCPs decreased slightly from 15.1 to 10.9 and averaged 14.4 ERCPs/100 000
persons/year. EUS and MRCP utilisation in the same population also steadily increased
over this time period (figure
1).

endoscopic ultrasound and MR cholangiopancreatography in Olmsted County over a
10-year period.

Procedural characteristics
Procedural characteristics can be seen in table 4. Of the 1072 ERCPs performed over the
10-year period, 606 (56.5%) were performed on inpatients, while 889
(82.9%) were therapeutic. The proportion of therapeutic procedures from 2002
to 2006 was higher than that from 1997 to 2001 (86.6% vs 77.5%,
p=0.0001). The difficulty grades, as defined by the Morriston Hospital ERCP
grading scale, were mostly grade II (494, 46.1%) and grade III (297,
27.7%) procedures overall; however, there was a twofold increase in grade IV
procedures in the second 5-year period, compared with the first (15.3% vs
7.2%, p<0.0001). ERCP was performed primarily for a biliary indication
in 853 procedures (79.6%) and a pancreatic indication in 95 procedures
(8.9%) with 122 procedures (11.4%) for both a biliary and pancreatic
indication. The commonest biliary indications included choledocholithiasis (500,
46.6%), biliary colic in the absence of documented choledocholithiasis (307,
28.6%) and relief of malignant biliary obstruction (116, 10.8%). The
commonest pancreatic indications for ERCP were to determine aetiology of acute
pancreatitis (135, 12.6%), or recurrent acute pancreatitis (34, 3.2%)
and chronic pancreatic fluid collection (18, 1.7%). Suspected sphincter of
Oddi dysfunction was the indication in only 19 (1.7%) ERCPs. A trainee was
involved in 667 (62.2%) cases.

Biliary sphincterotomy was performed in 620 (57.8%) procedures; the pancreatic
duct was injected in 404 (37.7%) cases and was cannulated in 255
(23.8%) procedures. In some cases, the intent was to cannulate the bile duct,
but pancreatic duct injection occurred during the process. Biliary stents were placed
in 185 (17.3%) cases; prophylactic pancreatic stents were placed in 59
(5.5%) patients. Placement of pancreatic stents increased in the second 5-year
period, compared with the first (8.1% vs 1.6%, p<0.0001).
Ampullectomy was performed in seven (0.7%) cases and 16 (1.5%) cases
were transgastric or transduodenal debridements of pancreatic necrosis (15 of which
occurred in the second 5-year period, p=0.0053). Only 31 (2.9%) ERCPs
were deemed as failures as the goal of the procedure was not achieved, resulting in a
97.1% success rate. None of the patients received any prophylaxis to prevent
post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).

Sedation
Only 42 (3.9%) of procedures were performed with anaesthesia support. Of the
remaining ERCPs carried out under moderate sedation, the mean dose of fentanyl was
159±86 µg (in 51 ERCPs), midazolam 6.1±2.6 mg
(1028 ERCPs), meperidine 97±46 mg (979 ERCPs) and promethazine
21±8 mg (90 ERCPs).

Outcomes
Following 1072 ERCPs in Olmsted County, over 10 years, there were 273
admissions to the hospital within 30 days after 236 procedures (22% of
all procedures). Table 5 lists the outcomes in the study cohort. Of the 273
admissions, only 62 (22.7%) were definitely related to the index ERCP
procedure, with another 2 (0.7%) probably related and 4 (1.4%) possibly
related to the procedure. Of the remaining 205 admissions unrelated to procedural AEs
of the index ERCP, 79 were planned for elective surgeries, including cholecystectomy.
Intraprocedural AEs were infrequent, with 20 (1.9%) necessitating a change in
intraprocedural anaesthesia; no deaths occurred during the procedure. There were 47
sphincterotomy-induced intraprocedural bleeding episodes treated with various
modalities, including epinephrine injection, cautery and tamponade.

The AE rate was 5.3% including pancreatitis (26, 2.4%),
infection/cholangitis (16, 1.5%), bleeding (15, 1.4%) and perforation
(4, 0.37%). Fifty-three cases were determined to be mild to moderate; however,
3 infections, all 4 perforations and 1 bleed were considered severe. The 30-day death
rate was 2.4%; 69% of deaths were due to underlying malignancy,
12% were due to infections unrelated to ERCP and 19% were due to other
causes including stroke, respiratory failure and dementia. None of the deaths were
directly related to ERCP or AEs thereof. Repeat ERCP procedures were required in 93
(8.7%) patients and 45 (4.2%) had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy within
30 days of the index ERCP.

Risk factors for AEs
In order to determine if there were identifiable risk factors for AEs arising from
ERCP in our cohort, the relative frequency and distribution of patient and procedural
characteristics were compared between patients who had a procedural AE and those who
did not (table 6). Patient
characteristics identified through multivariate analysis to be associated with AEs
included: age less than 45 years (OR 2.23 (95% CI 1.03 to 4.84) for age
<45 vs ≥65 years, p=0.0498) and BMI ≥35 (OR 0.31
(95% CI 0.14 to 0.72) for BMI 25–34 vs ≥35, p=0.0024).
Procedural characteristics identified to be associated with increased risk of AEs
included: patient's first ERCP (OR 2.22 (95% CI 1.04 to 4.75),
p=0.0394); pancreatic duct cannulation (OR 2.7 (95%CI 1.4 to 5.1),
p=0.0026); outpatient procedure (OR 5.4 (95% CI 2.6 to 11.4),
p<0.0001); intraprocedure sphincterotomy bleeding (OR 10.0 (95% CI 3.8
to 26.1), p<0.0001); difficulty grade (OR 8.9 (95% CI 1.9 to 43.1) for
grade 4 vs 1, p=0.0204).

Discussion
In the adult Olmsted County study population, which is considered to be representative
of the US population, ERCP utilisation rates nearly doubled over the 10-year period from
1 January 1997 to 31 December 2006 from 58 to 104.8 cases/100 000
persons/year.15 This trend was influenced by a
substantial increase in the rate of therapeutic procedures and a slight decrease in
diagnostic procedures. Importantly, ERCP was performed predominantly for common
‘bread and butter’ indications including cholangitis, biliary colic and
pancreatitis. This information underscores the fact that ERCP is currently mainly a
therapeutic modality, and should be available at a community-based level. Training in
ERCP should be focused on gaining expertise mainly for removal of common duct stones and
relief of distal biliary obstruction. For a community-based gastroenterologist, the need
for more complex procedures is rare, and these procedures should be carried out at
tertiary care centres.

ERCP utilisation rates in Olmsted County in this study are in some ways divergent from
national data. For instance, Mazen Jamal et al16 queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data for ERCP
utilisation rates from 1996 to 2002. They found that the rate of inpatient ERCPs dropped
from 74.95/100 000 persons in 1996 to 59.70/100 000 in 2002, driven mostly
by a decrease in diagnostic procedures, while there was a slight concomitant increase in
therapeutic procedures. However, because they were using an NIS sample, data are not
available on outpatient utilisation of ERCP. In contrast, outpatient procedures
comprised 43.5% of procedures in our study.

Over the study period, overall utilisation of EUS and MRCP have also increased in
Olmsted County. ERCP is most likely utilised now almost exclusively for therapeutic
purposes because of the diagnostic abilities of EUS and MRCP, and the improvements in
contrast-enhanced CT scans. Also, increased use of EUS and MRCP might actually result in
more therapeutic ERCP as seen in our study, which contradicts the popular belief that
utilisation of ERCP has decreased over time with the increased use of other diagnostic
modalities.

Unplanned admissions commonly occur after ERCP (22% within 30 days), but
are most often not related to procedural AEs, which occur in 5.3% of all patients
undergoing ERCP. Unplanned admissions within 30 days after a procedure are
increasingly being counted as negative indicators of healthcare quality.17 However, our data suggest that in the case of
ERCP, this outcome measure may not be a valid indicator of the quality of the procedure
itself and is most likely related to either underlying disease, a finding of the
procedure itself that leads to elective surgery, or possibly to other comorbidities.
Identification and complete capture of 30-day admissions is one of the strengths of our
study, in comparison to past studies, where capturing remote AEs were incomplete.6 Because this is a population-based study, and Mayo
Clinic is the only provider for ERCP in the population, all AEs were identified.

Severe procedural AEs, including pancreatitis (2.4%), bleeding (1.5%),
infection (1.4%) and mortality related to the procedure (0%), were
uncommon. Most AEs were mild to moderate, and at rates similar to previously published
reports.3
6 In a systematic review of 21 surveys of ERCP, AE
rates in a population of 16 855 patients were 6.85%, with pancreatitis,
infection and bleeding occurring in 3.5%, 1.4% and 1.3% of
cases;3 the death rate was 0.33%. Cotton
et al reported on 11 497 procedures at multiple centres and
found a 4% AE rate, with rates of 2.6% for pancreatitis and 0.3%
for bleeding. The death rate in this cohort was 0.06%.6 Although 2.4% of patients in our study died within
30 days of ERCP, none of these deaths were ERCP-related, and there were no
intraprocedural or peri-procedural deaths in our study. Because the AE rates in our
study are similar to the rates reported in the literature, it is most likely that the
ERCP procedures carried out at other tertiary care centres are also associated with low
AE rates.

Numerous studies have enumerated various risk factors for AEs following ERCP.6

19 The commonly accepted risk factors for any AE
after ERCP include suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, cirrhosis, difficult
cannulation, performance of precut sphincterotomy, percutaneous biliary access and lower
ERCP case volumes, with young age, pancreatic duct contrast injection and failed biliary
drainage identified in some studies. In our study, younger patient age, higher BMI,
first ERCP, pancreatic duct cannulation, intraprocedural post sphincterotomy bleeding,
therapeutic procedures and outpatient procedures were identified as risk factors for any
AE through a multivariate analysis.

Consistent with our findings, younger age has been previously shown to be a risk factor
for AEs, especially post-PEP.5
8
10 Pancreatic duct cannulation is known to be a
risk-factor for development of PEP.6 Towards the
end of this study period, data emerged supporting the use of prophylactic pancreatic
duct stents to decrease the incidence of PEP and were published. In our study period, in
only 59 (5.5%) procedures, we placed a pancreatic duct stent. Hence, our study is
not able to adequately define the rate of PEP with routine placement of prophylactic
pancreatic stents.

One limitation of our study is that it is a retrospective review of data with its
inherent biases. However, the data were manually abstracted by a single
gastroenterologist from an electronic medical record, and significant AEs and
hospitalisations are not likely to have been missed. Another limitation is that even
though the population studied is a county-based population, the skills of the
endoscopists are at a higher level than those of endoscopists in smaller community
hospitals. Therefore, the AE rate in this community setting could be lower than one
would expect in community settings at large. While MRCP is widely available, wherever
MRI is available, EUS availability is limited to those centres with trained
endosonographers; it is possible that the latter may affect regional utilisation of ERCP
for diagnostic purposes. Another notable limitation is that Sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction and complications of pancreatitis, diagnoses often referred to a tertiary
centre, were under-represented in our study.

In conclusion, our study shows that utilisation of ERCP at a population level continues
to rise; specifically utilisation of therapeutic procedures. The most common indications
for ERCP remain relief of biliary colic or cholangitis, and this procedure may be
carried out with moderate sedation. AEs of ERCP remain uncommon and deaths are
infrequent. The study adds important epidemiological data on trends in the utilisation
of ERCP, as well as population-based estimates of the risk of AEs from ERCP that will be
useful in clinical decision-making and determination of resource allocation. The
findings of the study may also impact ERCP training criteria.
