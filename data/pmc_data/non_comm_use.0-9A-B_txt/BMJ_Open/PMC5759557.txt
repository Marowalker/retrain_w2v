Non-stress test (NST) is known as one of the most common assessments for evaluation of fetus wellbeing. Since the prevalence of its false positive resultsishigh and majority of fetuses with non-reactive results are not at risk, it is important to find out effective approaches to identify such results to avoid unnecessary interventions. So this survey was conducted with the aim of comparing the effects of acoustic stimulation with feeding mothers stimulation on non-reactive NST results.

Methods
This study performed on 104 healthy pregnant women with non-reactive NST results and gestational ages between 32 and 42 weeks in Tabriz Alzahra hospital. Subjects were divided into two groups for acoustic stimulation and feeding mother stimulation. Halfan hour later NST repeated for participants of each group in the same environmental condition and again the results evaluated.

Results
According to our findings, 75% of subjects with non-reactive NST results changed to reactive after acoustic stimulation group. However, 80% of participants with non-reactive NST results changed into reactive after feeding Stimulation. No significant differences found while comparing test results.

Conclusion
Both stimulating approaches were effective in the identification of false positive NSTs and might be useful in preventing the unnecessary interventions.
