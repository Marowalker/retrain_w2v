All the countries are moving towards universal coverage insurance. in their ability to achieve universal coverage, it is likely that they would have similar effects on the health care utilization of the people who gained coverage. This study aimed to examine the relationship between health insurance status and utilization of health services.

We used two synthesis approaches: narrative synthesis and vote- counting.

All retrieved articles were qualitative study. age, Gender, Education, Marriage, Employment, Health status, insurance status, household size, Income, Inpatient and Outpatient services, Physician visit, and Emergency visit are important factors on the utilization and influence the utilization of health services positively. Also health services utilization among insured was significantly higher than that of the uninsured households.
