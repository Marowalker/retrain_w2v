Moody A, Cowley G, Ng Fat L, et al. Social inequalities in prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose regulation in participants in the Health Surveys for England series. BMJ Open 2016;6:e010155.

The UK ethnicity categories have been changed over to the USA standard terms.  Since the participants were living in England, and the questionnaire asked them the standard UK categories (see below) the correct ethnic categories are as follows:

White (rather than Caucasian)

Black (rather than African-American)

Asian

And Mixed.

Therefore, ‘African-American’ should be replaced with ‘Black’ in the ‘Abstract’, ‘Strengths and weaknesses’, and ‘Participant characteristics’ sections; ‘Caucasian’ should be replaced with ‘White’ in the ‘Abstract’ and ‘Participant characteristics’ sections. They are correctly labelled in the tables.
