The increasing incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV-linked conditions like genital warts (GWs) among women is a worldwide concern. Sexual contact is the chief route of transmission of genital HPV infections and it has been estimated that about 70–80% of sexually active individuals will be exposed to genital HPV in their lifetime. Sexually active women under 25 years old have the highest rates of genital HPV infection. GWs are estimated to affect about 1% of sexually active women aged between 15 and 49 years old worldwide, with peak prevalence occurring in the twenties (20–29). GWs are seen in the dermatological or gynaecological outpatient clinics as there is no a STD clinic per se in Libya.

Goal
To explore the evidence for possible interventions that might reduce the prevalence of genital warts.

Objective
To examine the literature relating to the knowledge and attitudes of patients and others, and the behaviours (KAB) connected with GWs.

Methods
The search strategy for this review was based on the context of “KAB”, and the key search words used were “genital wart”, “condyloma acuminate”, and “venereal warts”. The search was then focused on literature involving knowledge and GWs, attitudes and GWs and behaviours and GWs, in developing and developed countries. A database was used which integrated EBSCO, Scopus, Cochrane, life science database, journals, and peer review, and the English-language literature which were explored for the last ten years.

Results
Many women are still uncertain about the basic facts regarding HPV and cervical cancer and GWs.

Conclusion
From the literature review it has been found that there is a wide range of reported levels of knowledge about HPV internationally.

This project demonstrated significant gaps in knowledge among many women worldwide about genital and HPV infection which varies according to ethnicity, socio-economic and other demographic characteristics

Australian women in the literature seemed to be well informed about genital infection and HPV and this can possibly be attributed to the broad educational campaign about HPV connected to their vaccination campaign.

Moreover, Dermatologists need robust to acquire new skills in constructing answerable questions, efficiently searching electronic bibliographic databases, and critically appraising different types of studies.
