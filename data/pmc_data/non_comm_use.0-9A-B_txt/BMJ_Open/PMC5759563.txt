Poor quality of sleep and daily activity in elderly people are associated with many physical and psychological problems that increase disability and need to use health services. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between daily activities and quality of sleep in the elderly people.

Methods
This Study was a correlational-descriptive study on390 elderly people in Zanjan in 2013. The sampling was done using a cluster and multistage method. Data were collected via face-to-face interview, using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a questionnaire on “activities of daily living” (ADL) and “instrumental activities of daily living” (IADL). Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistic including number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and inferential statistical tests including Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance.

Results
The mean score of ADL and IADL was 11.58±0.81 (score range 0–14) and 11.23±2.93 (score range 0–18), respectively. In addition, 85.7%of the subjects in the study had poor sleep quality and only 14.3% had good sleep quality. The results also indicated no significant relationship between the daily activities and quality of sleep in the elderly, while Instrumental activities had a weak positive and significant correlation with their sleep quality (P≥0.05).

Conclusion
Although the elderly in this study have poor sleep quality, they are independent in performing ADL and IADL. Furthermore, there is a weak and direct correlation between sleep quality and instrumental activities of the old people. Improvement of activity in the elderly can improve their quality of sleep.
