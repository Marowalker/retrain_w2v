Slade T, Swift W, Mewton L, et al. RADAR study: protocol for an observational cohort study to identify early warning signals on the pathways to alcohol use disorder BMJ Open 2017;7:e018256. DOI:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018256.

This article was previously published with an error.

In the methods and analysis section the text reads:

Participants will be eligible for RADAR if and when they report either: (1) frequent drinking (defined as consuming any quantity of alcohol at least 1–2 days/week over a 12-month period), or (2) semifrequent binge drinking (defined as consuming more than 4 standard drinks, ie, 40 g alcohol, in a single session at least 3–4 days/month over a 12-month period).

However, the correct text should read:

Participants will be eligible for RADAR if and when they report either: (1) frequent drinking (defined as consuming any quantity of alcohol at least 1–2 days/week over a 12-month period), or (2) semifrequent binge drinking (defined as consuming more than 4 standard drinks, ie, 40 g alcohol, in a single session at least 2–3 days/month over a 12-month period).
