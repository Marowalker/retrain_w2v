To evaluate the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of complex workplace
dietary interventions, involving nutrition education and system-level dietary
modification, from the perspective of healthcare providers and employers.

Design
Single-study economic evaluation of a cluster-controlled trial (Food Choice at
Work (FCW) study) with 1-year follow-up.

Setting
Four multinational manufacturing workplaces in Cork, Ireland.

Participants
517 randomly selected employees (18–65 years) from four workplaces.

Interventions
Cost data were obtained from the FCW study. Nutrition education included
individual nutrition consultations, nutrition information (traffic light menu
labelling, posters, leaflets and emails) and presentations. System-level dietary
modification included menu modification (restriction of fat, sugar and salt),
increase in fibre, fruit discounts, strategic positioning of healthier
alternatives and portion size control. The combined intervention included
nutrition education and system-level dietary modification. No intervention was
implemented in the control.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was an improvement in health-related quality of life, measured
using the EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels questionnaire. The secondary outcome
measure was reduction in absenteeism, which is measured in monetary amounts.
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo simulation) assessed parameter
uncertainty.

Results
The system-level intervention dominated the education and combined interventions.
When compared with the control, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(€101.37/quality-adjusted life-year) is less than the nationally accepted
ceiling ratio, so the system-level intervention can be considered cost-effective.
The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicates there is some decision
uncertainty surrounding this, arising from uncertainty surrounding the differences
in effectiveness. These results are reiterated when the secondary outcome measure
is considered in a cost–benefit analysis, whereby the system-level
intervention yields the highest net benefit (€56.56 per employee).

Conclusions
System-level dietary modification alone offers the most value per improving
employee health-related quality of life and generating net benefit for employers
by reducing absenteeism. While system-level dietary modification strategies are
potentially sustainable obesity prevention interventions, future research should
include long-term outcomes to determine if improvements in outcomes persist.

Strengths and limitations of this study
This is the first study to comprehensively integrate health effectiveness evidence
with the economic costs of implementing and delivering workplace dietary
interventions.

The inclusion of a cost–benefit analysis which monetised absenteeism,
facilitated the translation of trial outcomes into realisable benefits for
businesses.

The main limitation of this study is that it did not include long-term outcomes.
Therefore, the potential for costs to be offset in the future is unknown.

Introduction
The increasing prevalence of diet-related disease is a major contributor to global
morbidity and mortality and also to escalating healthcare spending.1 2 Calorie excess and dietary intakes of fat (saturated and trans
fats), sugar and salt play a critical role in the development of many chronic
diet-related diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease stroke and type 2
diabetes.3 In an effort to ease the health and
economic burden of chronic diet-related disease, the workplace has been identified as a
priority setting to positively influence individuals’ dietary behaviours with
individuals now spending up to two-thirds of their waking hours at work.3 4 Owing to limited evidence on the effectiveness
of workplace dietary interventions and the need to integrate health effectiveness
evidence with economic costs, an investigation of their cost-effectiveness is
needed.5–8

When estimating the cost-effectiveness of a workplace intervention, it is imperative
that consideration is given to clinical and quality of life measures, and towards
measuring the impact of the intervention on absenteeism. Employers bear the financial
burden of diet-related diseases through workplace absenteeism which incurs both direct
and indirect costs.9–14
Direct costs include sick pay schemes, medical referrals and the cost associated with
replacing absent employees and indirect costs consist primarily of losses incurred
through absenteeism which in turn leads to reduced productivity.15 In the UK alone, workplace absenteeism is estimated to
cost £29 billion annually with a reported 131 million days lost to
absenteeism in 2013.16 In an effort to halt these
mounting costs, many employers are investing in workplace health promotion programmes;
however, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of these programmes is limited.17 18 Furthermore, recent research has revealed
that when investing in workplace health promotion, employers are also driven by
altruistic motives and feel responsible for enabling the health of their employees.19 20 Employers feel responsible for creating a
healthy workplace environment that will meet their employees’ growing
expectations, which will help employee attract and retain employees.19 20 Similarly, employers have become
increasingly concerned with portraying a positive company image to industry and to their
employees and perceive the implementation of workplace health interventions as a means
of achieving this image.19 21

The Food Choice at Work (FCW) study was a cluster-controlled trial of complex
workplace dietary interventions.22 The novel
trial assessed the comparative effectiveness of a system-level dietary modification
intervention and a nutrition education intervention both alone and in combination versus
a control workplace. The findings demonstrate that a well-structured, complex workplace
dietary intervention, combining nutrition education and system-level dietary
modification, reduces employee’s dietary intakes of salt and saturated fat,
improves employees’ nutrition knowledge and decreases their body mass index.5 Thus, combining nutrition education and
system-level dietary modification is an effective approach for promoting a healthy diet
and weight loss at work. This study employed standard economic evaluation methodology
and evidence from the FCW trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of complex workplace
dietary interventions. Cost-effectiveness of this complex workplace dietary intervention
was assessed from two different perspectives: (1) the health system perspective in terms
of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), that is, a cost–utility analysis
and (2) an employer’s perspective in terms of monetary benefit, that is, a
cost–benefit analysis.

Methods
This analysis follows the standard methodology of cost-effectiveness analysis and builds
on previous analysis of workplace interventions to reduce absenteeism in the
workplace.5 23 The methods and data used
are explained with a more detailed description of modelling assumptions given.

Interventions
Full details of the FCW study have been described elsewhere.5 22 Briefly, a cluster controlled trial was
conducted in four large manufacturing workplaces in Cork, Ireland for a 9-month time
period. Workplaces were allocated to receive one of the following: nutrition
education alone (education) (n=226); system-level dietary modification alone
(system-level) (n=113); combined intervention (combined) (n=400) or no intervention
(control) (n=111). The number of employees recruited per workplace was proportionate
to company size.5 The nutrition education
intervention was provided using individual nutrition consultations, group
presentations and detailed nutrition education (traffic light menu labelling,
posters, leaflets and e-mails). In the system-level intervention, dietary
modification elements were implemented which included menu modification (restriction
of fat, sugar and salt), an increase in fibre, fruit and vegetables, price discounts
on fruit, strategic positioning of healthier alternatives and portion size control.
The combined intervention included received all elements of the education and
system-level interventions and no intervention was implemented in the control.5
Table 1 contains a detailed description of the
multicomponent intervention elements.

Table 1 Description of the intervention elements

Intervention	Description of elements	
Nutrition education	Group presentations: Monthly nutrition
sessions (30 min per session) were delivered in the workplace by
the FCW nutritionist. Topics included portion control, food labelling and
general healthy eating guidelines. Sessions were repeated to ensure they
were accessible to employees on different shift cycles.	
Individual nutrition consultations:
Participants received one-to-one dietary counselling with the FCW
nutritionist. Consultations were tailored for each participant based on
their lifestyle, physical assessment results and dietary recall
assessments. The nutritionist provided advice on how to follow a healthy
diet, reach/maintain a healthy body weight and achieve healthy resting
blood pressure. Participants also received a healthy eating booklet and a
personalised measurement card.	
Detailed nutrition information: Detailed
nutrition information was prepared by the FCW nutritionist and displayed
in the workplace throughout the intervention. The information included
posters, leaflets, e-mails and daily calorie menu labelling with a unique
traffic light coding system. A healthy eating chat table was also
provided twice a month during break times to provide employees with an
opportunity to ask the nutritionist about healthy eating.	
Environmental dietary
modification	Menu modification: Fat, saturated fat,
sugar and salt were restricted. Stock and bouillon were replaced with
low-salt stock options. Salt was replaced with fresh herbs, spices and
garlic for additional flavour. High-salt savoury options, high-salt
products and processed meats were reduced and replaced where possible
with low-salt options. Full-fat dairy products were replaced with low-fat
options where possible. Cream and cheese were not used as a garnish on
meals and the amount of cheddar in all meals was reduced. Cooking methods
using oil (deep-fat frying) were limited and replaced with boiling,
poaching, grilling, baking and steaming where possible. Plant oils were
introduced for cooking. Sauces and accompaniments were not added to any
meal unless requested by the employee. Chips and French fries were
removed from the menus 2 days a week and were replaced with
different potato options such as baked potatoes. Soft carbonated drinks
were restricted and replaced with water, milk and unsweetened
options.	
Increase in fibre and availability of fruit
and vegetables: White pasta, rice and bread were replaced with wholegrain
alternatives. Fruit and vegetables were added to rice, pasta, soup and
meat dishes. Fresh whole fruit was made available throughout the day and
a buffet-style fresh salad bar was available to accompany any dish on a
daily basis.	
Price discounts: Portions of whole fresh fruit
were offered at discount prices on a daily basis within the confines of
the pre-existing catering contract.	
Strategic positioning of food: Healthier
alternatives were strategically positioned throughout the workplace
canteen. Healthy snacks, such as fresh fruit, dried nuts, seeds, brown
sandwiches and brown soda bread were positioned at eye level at the
entrance of the canteen and in the vending machines. Free-flowing salt
and sugar were removed from tables and replaced with sachets.	
Portion size control: Standard serving tools
were used to control portion size at mealtimes. Catering staff received
training from the FCW nutritionist regarding strict portion
size control.

Economic evaluation
This economic evaluation was primarily informed by national guidelines.24 Given the nature and scope of the
intervention, a health service provider and employer’s perspective was taken.
A cost–utility analysis measured the cost-effectiveness of the interventions
in terms of QALYs and a cost–benefit analysis was employed, whereby the
monetary value of absenteeism was used to estimate the net benefit of each
intervention relative to the control.

Costs
A cost analysis of the FCW trial has been described elsewhere.25 In summary, a bottom-up approach using
microcosting was employed, whereby intervention costs were disaggregated from the
employer’s perspective. The FCW research team involved in the development and
implementation of the interventions were consulted to identify, measure and value the
resources consumed under each intervention. The costs were classified into three
different phases, representing setup costs, maintenance costs and physical assessment
costs. Five cost categories were identified for each phase: (1) nutritionist costs;
(2) catering costs; (3) management costs; (4) employee costs and (5) printing and
material costs. Following identification of the resources consumed in each
intervention, the unit costs of the resources were multiplied by the quantities used.
Costs were valued in monetary terms using standard techniques in line with national
guidelines.23 24 A detailed exposition
of the costs and approaches used to estimate and value resources are fully described
elsewhere.25
Table 2 contains a breakdown of the total cost
of the FCW interventions over 12 months. Total costs were standardised
for a cohort of 517 employees per workplace, which reflected the number of employees
that completed the trial. Standardising costs for a 12-month period and for a cohort
of 517 employees per workplace will increase the comparability of findings for
employers. In addition, having the same sample size per workplace will allow
employers to use the costs as a benchmark for similarly sized workplaces. Total costs
were highest in the combined intervention (€52 940), followed by the
education intervention (€50 216) and the system-level intervention
(€25 345). In the control, physical assessment costs (monitoring of
employees) accounted for 100% of costs (€22 201). All resource
quantities and costs were estimated and reported in 2016 € (Ireland).
Discounting was not undertaken due to the 1-year time horizon.

Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was an improvement in QALYs from baseline to
7–9-month follow-up. To measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) the
EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels questionnaire was employed, as per national
guidelines.24 As data were only available
for 7–9 months, HRQoL was extrapolated from 9 to 12 months to obtain HRQoL for
a 1-year period, with the assumption that HRQoL remained constant for 12 months. In
the absence of value set for Ireland, the UK cross-walk value set was employed to
estimate QALYs.26

The secondary outcome measure was the net benefit of the interventions in terms of
reducing absenteeism. Annual absence data for a year prior to and a year
postintervention implementation were obtained from the human resources department of
each workplace. The monetary value of absenteeism was employed to report the net
benefit of the interventions compared with the control. Reductions in absenteeism
were valued using national estimates of the national average daily cost of
absenteeism (€144.48).27 Complete
follow-up data were available for a total of 517 employees from the four workplaces,

trial and are presented in table

Assessing cost-effectiveness and investigating uncertainty
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net benefit were employed to assess
the cost-effectiveness of each intervention using the primary and secondary outcomes
for a cost–utility analysis and cost–benefit analysis,
respectively.24 28 A probabilistic
sensitivity analysis, using Monte Carlo simulation was performed to assess parameter
uncertainty. Probability distributions were assigned to individual model parameters.
As the cost data were non-negative, continuous data, they assumed gamma distributions
and the outcomes assumed normal probability distributions.29 The Monte Carlo simulation propagated uncertainty throughout
the model and provided 10 000 different values for expected costs and expected
outcomes associated with each intervention and the control. The average of the
expected costs and effects were used to estimate net benefit and ICERs in the
probabilistic model. These ICERs were plotted onto incremental cost-effectiveness
planes, with the costs plotted in the north–south axis and the effects plotted
on the east–west axis. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve summarised
decision uncertainty by graphically demonstrating the probability of an intervention
being cost-effective compared with the control using a range of ceiling ratios
(€0 to €100 000/QALY).30

Results
Cost–utility analysis
With regards to intervention costs per employee, the lowest cost per employee was
observed in the control (€42.94), followed by the system-level intervention
(€49.02), the education intervention (€97.13) and the combined
intervention (€102.40). Meanwhile, each of the interventions delivered QALY
improvements, the largest improvement was observed in the system-level intervention
(+0.05 QALYs), followed by the education intervention (+0.03 QALYs), the combined
intervention (+0.01 QALYs); while the control resulted in deterioration (−0.01
QALYs) (table 4).

Comparing the costs and QALY improvements, it is evident that the system-level
intervention dominates both the education intervention and the combined intervention,
as it delivers greater benefit at a lower cost. While compared with the control, the
system-level intervention delivers more benefit but at a greater cost, positioning it
in the northeastern quadrant on a cost-effectiveness plane. The ICER of the
system-level intervention compared with control, €101.37/QALY, is well below
what is considered cost-effective nationally (€45 000/QALY). However,
the incremental cost-effectiveness plane (figure
1) demonstrates there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the existence
and extent of differences in effectiveness between the system-level intervention and
the control (95% range produced in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis produced a
95% range of −0.49 to +0.60.) This translates into decision
uncertainty, presented on the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (figure 2), with 58% probability of the system-level
intervention being cost-effective compared with control. As the ceiling ratio
increases beyond €100/QALY, the probability of the system-level intervention
being cost-effective increases while it falls for the control.

(additional QALYs) but at a greater cost, positioning the ICER in the
northeastern quadrant on the cost-effectiveness plane. The plane illustrates

Cost–benefit analysis
As discussed above the secondary outcome measure for the study was absenteeism which
is employed in a cost–benefit analysis to assess cost-effectiveness from an
employer’s perspective. As outlined above the lowest cost per employee was
observed in the control (€42.94), followed by the system-level intervention
(€49.02), the education intervention (€97.13) and the combined
intervention (€102.40). Similar to the QALY estimates, each of the
interventions improved absenteeism; the largest improvement was observed in the
combined intervention (−0.78 days), followed by the system-level intervention
(−0.71) and the education intervention (−0.36 days), while the
control resulted in increased absenteeism (+0.34 days) (table 4). The reduction in absenteeism is expressed in monetary
amounts using the national daily cost of absenteeism per employee of €144.48.
The control and nutrition education interventions had negative net benefits,
that is, the costs of the intervention outweighed the benefits of reduced
absenteeism. The system-level and combined interventions had positive net benefits,
that is, the savings gained from reduced absenteeism were greater than the
costs of the intervention. The system-level intervention had the highest net benefit,
€53.56 per employee, and therefore dominates the other interventions. These
results are consistent with those in the cost–utility analysis which measured
outcomes in terms of QALYs.

Discussion
This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of a complex workplace dietary
intervention, which included nutrition education and system-level dietary modification
elements both alone and in combination versus a control workplace. The system-level
intervention dominated the education and combined interventions as it delivered greater
benefit (QALYs) at lower costs. Compared with the control, the system-level intervention
also delivered greater QALYs at an additional cost. The low ICER suggests the
intervention is cost-effective, nevertheless, there is considerable uncertainty
surrounding the difference in effects. The cost-effectiveness of the system-level
intervention was reiterated when considering the secondary outcome measure (absenteeism
measured in euros in a cost–benefit analysis) as it delivered highest net
benefit.

The main strength of this economic evaluation is that it is one of the first studies to
comprehensively integrate health effectiveness evidence with the economic costs of
implementing and delivering workplace dietary interventions. The findings from the
economic evaluation complement the findings from the FCW cluster controlled trial that
suggests workplace dietary interventions can potentially improve employee health.5–8 Moreover, the study provides
employers, public health policy-makers, national and international catering stakeholders
and industry with robust cost-effectiveness evidence on workplace dietary interventions.
The inclusion of a cost–benefit analysis is an additional significant strength of
this novel study. The Medical Research Council advocate that if an intervention is
proven to be effective as improving health behaviours of employees, it is more likely
that the intervention will be implemented at scale if the outcomes are presented in a
way that is of relevance to those who are bearing the costs of the intervention.32 Therefore, in instances where interventions are
funded by private industry, it is imperative that the monetary net benefits are of
relevance to the business. In this study, monetising absenteeism facilitated the
translation of the FCW trial outcomes into realisable and tangible benefits for
businesses. Although each intervention reported a positive net benefit, it should be
noted that these results are reliant on the monetary estimate for absenteeism that was
used. The daily estimate that was used was obtained from the Irish Business and
Employers Confederation (IBEC) and adjusted for inflation (€144.48), as no other
suitable estimate within the Irish context is currently available.27

The study captures the high initial cost of intervention implementation without
incorporating long-term outcomes. Future research, which would include collecting data
on long-term outcomes, may also quantify further health and monetary benefits that were
not captured in this economic evaluation. For instance, improving employees’
dietary behaviours is likely to affect the dietary behaviours of their families and also
possibly their wider communities, generating positive externalities. Furthermore, it is
possible that the cost of sickness has been underestimated as this study did not measure
presenteeism. Presenteeism has been defined as being present at work despite being ill
and it is estimated that productivity losses due to presenteeism are significantly
higher than losses incurred from absenteeism.33
34 A 2016 Global Corporate Challenge report, estimated that in the USA,
employees were absent from work for an average of 4 days per year, while they were
unproductive at work for 57.5 days per year.35
The report further estimated that absenteeism costs US employers US$150 billion
annually while presenteeism costs were estimated at US$1500 billion
annually.35 To estimate the true cost of
sickness, future research should include measures for both absenteeism and presenteeism.
It should also be noted that the cost–benefit analysis might be capturing time
preference as employers may place greater value on short-term costs and benefits of
reducing absenteeism rather than those occurring in the future (improving employee
health). As this study did not include long-term outcomes, which is its main limitation,
the potential for costs to be offset in the future is unknown. Furthermore, the
inclusion of atypical multinational manufacturing workplaces along with the small sample
size, may potentially limit the generalisability of the findings. Additionally, the
potential presence of participation bias must be acknowledged. Despite employees being
randomly selected to participate in the study, bias cannot be ruled out as healthy
employees may have been more likely to participate in the study when compared with
unhealthier employees.

From a public health policy perspective, there is a definite need for pragmatism in the
assessment of low-risk interventions, such as those addressed in this study, in tackling
societal challenges of obesity and poor dietary behaviours.13 As any single obesity prevention intervention is likely to have
only a small impact at the aggregated level, there is a need to implement multiple
low-agency interventions that do not require individuals to consciously engage with any
intervention element of change their behaviour.36
This study suggests that despite the use of a short time frame, system-level
dietary modification interventions can potentially offer the best value in terms of
improving employee health and generating monetary benefit for employers through reducing
absenteeism.
