This article was previously published with an error.

Two conditions used to create multimorbidity were incorrectly explained in the methods section:

Hypercholesterolaemia has included individuals presenting the condition for more than 1 year. The information about the time was not described in the original version.

Spinal column problem was based on self-reported information from the interviewee. In the original text, the condition was described as a self-reported medical diagnosis.
