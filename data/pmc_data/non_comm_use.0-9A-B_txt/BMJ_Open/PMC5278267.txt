Hanaki N, Yamashita K, Kunisawa S, et al. Effect of the number of request calls on the time from call to hospital arrival: a cross-sectional study of an ambulance record database in Nara prefecture, Japan. BMJ Open 2016;6:e012194.

The baseline patient characteristics were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA), not the Kruskal–Wallis test. Therefore the corrected Table 1 footnote should read:
*P-value by ANOVA

†P-value by Student's t-test

SD: standard deviation, Qu: quartile, ACS: acute coronary syndromes, CPA: Cardiopulmonary arrest,

DOC: disturbance of consciousness, request call: request call to hospital for transportation

The detailed information about each area are not available for disclosing, because of data sharing policy.



In table 3 the column header “Time from call to hospital arrival” should read “Time for request call”. The corrected Table 3 is shown below.

Table 3 The number and the time for request call categorized by hospital displayed acceptability and request results

Hospital Displayed Admission Acceptability		Number of request call				
	n (%)	Time for request call		
Result	N=79,693	mean (SD)	1st Qu-3rd Qu	P-value*	
Accepting patients	Success	32,416 (40.7)	4.9 (3.4)	2.0–6.0		
Not accepting patients	Success	11,247 (14.1)	4.5 (3.9)	2.0–6.0		
Accepting patients	Failure	24,629 (30.9)	4.2 (3.1)	2.0–5.7		
Not accepting patients	Failure	11,401 (14.3)	4.2 (3.5)	2.0–5.3	<0.001	
*P-value by ANOVA.
Request call: request call to hospital for transportation, SD: standard deviation, Qu: quartile.
