Evidence based medicine (EBM) is a systematic process that can lead to enhancement of clinician's traditional skills in diagnosis and treatment. Teaching EBM to medical students will improve their performance and help them to be up-to-date in their profession. The aim of this study was to compare Shiraz (type 1 university) and Rafsanjan (type 2) students in clinical stage in Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) knowledge.

Methods
this is a comparative descriptive study that was conducted in Shiraz and Rafsanjan University of medical sciences in 2016. Questionnaires were distributed among 100 medical students in clinical stage (including externs and interns). In fact, 50 students were randomly selected from each university. The questioners included 10 questions; each question had 5 choices from very low (score 1) to very high (score 5). Therefore, the minimum score could be 10 and the maximum score 50. Data analysis was done using SPSS18 and independent T-Test.

Results
Our study indicate that there is no significant difference between shiraz and Rafsanjan students in EBM knowledge (p>0.05). In Shiraz, the minimum score the knowledge of evidence base ranking of articles (1.78+−0.84) and in Rafsanjan minimum score belonged to the knowledge of critiquing an article (1.76+−0.79). In both Shiraz and Rafsanjan, the maximum score belonged to the question in which their knowledge of appropriate treatment was evaluated. To compare total scores, there were no considerable differences between Rafsanjan (25.5±6.01) and Shiraz (25.8±6.05).

Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that there is no significant difference between the knowledge of medical students in type 1 (Shiraz) and type 2 (Rafsanjan) universities. This can be due to the absence of EBM in the universities curriculum, and we suggest that EBM needs more attention in education and curriculum.
