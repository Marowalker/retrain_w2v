There is a mistake in the Contributors section. It should say:

“Contributors GS initiated, supervised and conceived the study. L-TB drafted the manuscript and performed the experiments and data acquisition. NZ and CS assisted in data acquisition and the experimental site. NZ, AR and L-TB statistically analysed the data. RR approved the final manuscript. AR, GS and MC critically revised the manuscript. AR supervised the experiments and statistical analysis. All authors read and approved the final manuscript”.
