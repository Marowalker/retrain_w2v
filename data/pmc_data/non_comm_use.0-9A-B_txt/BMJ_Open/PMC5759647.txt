Improvement of maternal healthiness and decreasing maternal mortality and morbidity is one of important anxieties in the world. One of the factors that influence intensity of pain is duration of labor. In other words, increasing intensity of pain affects duration of labor. This study survey the effect of intramuscular Hyoscine and Hyoscine-Promethazine on the duration of labor in nulliparous pregnant women.

Methods
This study was three blind clinical trials on 213 nulliparous pregnant women who have referred to Amiralmomenin hospital in Zanjan. Selection of samples was random and done with Rand List software and used 3, 6 (1:1:1) of blocking size. This study had 3 groups. First group received 20 mg Hyoscine(A), second group 20mg Hyoscine and 25mg Promethazine(B) and third group 3cc sterile water(C). Data collection tools were including of a demographic questionnaire, checklist of data and Partograph chart. Analysis of data done by SPSS (ver16) and Anova (tukey) and chi-square test.

Results
Means of first stage of labor in Hyoscine group was 88.95±51.07 min, Hyoscine-Promethazine 100.05±65.88 min and control group 170.37±106.87 min. there is significant correlation between A,C and B, C groups (p<0.001). second stage means in group A was 46.37±44.60, group B 32.25±17.74 and control group 55.05±44.44 and significant relationship was between B,C groups(p=0.03). In third stage no significant difference observed between groups (p=0.105).

Conclusion
Sometimes and in some urgency cases, for decreasing duration of labor, we can use Hyoscine and Hyoscine-Promethazine.
