In the methods and analysis section, under the setting heading on page 3, the sentence:

The schools are from the Victorian Government Department of Education and Training (DET) and the Catholic Education Commission of Victoria (CECV) (22.07% and 67.62% of all primary schools in Victoria, respectively).

The percentages were written wrong way around. It should read:

The schools are from the Victorian Government Department of Education and Training (DET) and the Catholic Education Commission of Victoria (CECV) (67.62% and 22.07% of all primary schools in Victoria, respectively).
