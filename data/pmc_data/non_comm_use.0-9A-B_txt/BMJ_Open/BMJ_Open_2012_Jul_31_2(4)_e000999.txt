To investigate the associations between psychosocial risk factors and
self-reported health, taking into account other occupational risk factors.

Design
Cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire.

Setting
The three military hospitals in Paris, France.

Participants
Surveys were distributed to 3173 employees (1807 military and 1336 civilian), a
total of 1728 employees completed surveys. Missing data prohibited the use of 26
surveys.

Primary and secondary outcome measures
The authors used Karasek's model in order to identify psychosocial factors
(psychological demands, decisional latitude, social support) in the workplace. The
health indicator studied was self-reported health. Adjustments were made for
covariates: age, gender, civil or military status, work injury, ergonomic score,
physical and chemical exposures, and occupational profile. Occupational profile
was defined by professional category, department, work schedule, supervisor status
and service-related length in the hospital.

Results
Job strain (defined as high psychological demands and low decisional latitude)
(adjusted OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.8, p<0.001) and iso-strain (job strain
with low social support) were significantly associated with moderate or poor
self-reported health. Among covariates, occupational profile (p<0.001) and
an unsatisfactory ergonomic score (adjusted OR 2.3 95% CI 1.6 to 3.2,
p<0.001) were also significantly associated with moderate or poor
self-reported health.

Conclusions
The results support findings linking moderate or poor self-reported health to
psychosocial risk factors. The results of this study suggest that workplace
interventions that aim to reduce exposure to psychological demands as well as to
increase decisional latitude and social support could help improve self-reported
health.

Article summary
Article focus
Health professionals reported frequently distress at work due to work overloads
and the constant confrontation with illness.

We wanted to investigate the associations between psychosocial risk factors and
self-reported health in a military hospital group.

Key messages
Job strain and iso-strain were found to be associated with poor self-reported
health.

Self-reported health is a unique indication that succeeds in estimating the
multidimensional nature of health. It is a relevant synthetic indicator of
actual health status.

Strengths and limitations of this study
One of the strong points is that this study simultaneously explore psychosocial
risk factors and occupational risk factors.

The nature of the studied population and different response rates between
civilian and military staff limit the generalisation of the results to
healthcare workers in non-military settings.
==== Body
Introduction
Various types of occupational exposure are known to be risk factors for health. Changes
in the working environment over the past few decades have led to new risks for workers.
These emerging risks come under the heading of psychosocial risks.1 They are the ‘aspects of the conception, organisation and
management of the work, and of the social and environmental settings that have the
potential to cause psychological, social or physical damage'. According to Cox
and colleagues, psychosocial risks are decisive factors in tension, distress and
weariness, leading to stress.2 In 2002, Europe
made this theme one of its priorities for action, and an outline agreement on the
prevention of workplace stress was signed on 8 October 2004.3 This agreement provided a consensus definition of the state of
stress, defined as ‘an imbalance between the perceptions that a subject
entertains concerning constraints imposed on him or her by his/her environment, and the
perception that the person has of his or her own resources to meet these
demands’.3


The ‘job strain’ model developed by Karasek in the Job Content
Questionnaire (JCQ)4 is a theoretical model that
is well suited to this definition of stress and one of the most widely used model for
identifying psychosocial risk factors. According to this model, the deleterious effects
of work are due to a combination of high workload demands and low job decisional
latitude (job strain). Recently, a moderator of the effects of demand and control,
‘social support’, was introduced into this model.5


Healthcare professionals confront illness and death as part of their occupation, and
therefore, they may be at greater risk for stress-related illness.6–8 In addition, over the past 10 years, the
healthcare sector has undergone considerable restructuring and downsizing aimed at
reducing healthcare costs. These changes have led to work overloads.9 The French military hospitals, spared these trends
so far, are now subject to the same requirements as those in force in civilian hospital
facilities. The French military hospitals have roughly as many civilian staff as
military staff, answerable to the same requirements for health and safety set out in the
labour code. The military hospital contingent is distinct from the civilian contingent
by way of certain specific constraints, particularly linked to frequent missions due to
current operations in Afghanistan. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact
of psychosocial risk factors on the self-reported health of staff, taking into account
other occupational exposures.

Methods
Population
The target population of this study was made up of staff from the Paris Military
Hospital Group (PMHG). The PMHG consists of Bégin hospital in
Saint-Mandé, Percy hospital in Clamart (both Paris suburbs) and Val de
Grâce hospital in Paris. Total staff included 1807 military staff and 1366
civilian staff in 1 January 2009, with 2108 being female staff and 1065 male
staff.

Study design
It was an exhaustive cross-sectional study, based on an anonymous self-administered
questionnaire. It was circulated by mail delivery to all PMHG staff, with each
department receiving a set of questionnaires sufficient for its staff numbers. Each
questionnaire was in its own closed envelope, accompanied by a letter explaining the
study and a return envelope pre-addressed to the ‘Centre
d'Epidémiologie et de Santé Publique des
Armées’ (CESPA-Military Epidemiology and Public Health
Center). Between 3 February 2010 and 1 March 2010, 3173 questionnaires were
distributed across the three hospitals. The closing date for return of the
questionnaires was set for 30 April 2010. Questionnaires were returned to CESPA by
mail delivery. The results of this survey are presented for the three hospitals
conjointly.

Instrument and study variables
Self-administered questionnaire:
The part of the self-administered questionnaire established by the authors had six
sections: demographic, work, ergonomics, occupational exposures, work accident or
injury and self-reported health.

–Demographic included socio-demographic data of age, gender, marital
status and civilian or military status.

–Work-related information included: how long the person had worked in
the facility, their professional category, the name of the department where
they worked, a listing of their working schedules (night or day shift,
weekend work, total work hours per week). Professional categories were
medical doctor, specialised nurse, nurse, nursing assistant, medicotechnical
staff, technical staff and administrative staff.

–The ergonomics section was composed of 12 questions, using a 3-point
scale with three options, ‘not applicable’,
‘satisfied’ and ‘dissatisfied’. The questions
included how satisfactory their work area was to them in terms of
accessibility, comfort, height of the working surface, ease of handling
their equipment, provision and accessibility of required materials, noise
levels, thermal comfort, lighting, working schedules, movements on foot and
absence of situations exposing to physical or verbal aggression. A total
ergonomics score was defined as the sum of these 12 items. Each ‘not
applicable’ was scored 0, ‘dissatisfied’ was scored
−1 and ‘satisfied’ was scored 1. A subject was
considered dissatisfied with his or her environment if his or her overall
score was negative, middle group (neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) if the
overall score was null and satisfied if the overall score was positive.

–Two questions enabled the staff to give their feelings on their
exposure to ionising radiations and to chemical substances or preparations
categorised as ‘CMR’ (Carcinogens, Mutagens and Reproductive
toxins) at the European level and under the French Employment Code. The
answer options were ‘always’, ‘often’,
‘sometimes’ and ‘never’.

–The total number of new work injuries or accidents within the
previous 12 months and the total duration of any sick leave related
to these work injuries or accident were also recorded.

–For the assessment of state of health, we opted for the question and
response scale that is used by most countries in the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for surveys on the health
status of their populations: how do you view your state of health?
The Likert scale comprised the following response choices: ‘very
poor’, ‘poor’, ‘moderate’,
‘good’ and ‘very good’.10 For the analyses, perceived health status was recoded
as ‘good’ for responses ‘good’ and ‘very
good’ and recoded ‘moderate or poor’ for the other
three response options.

The second part of the self-administered questionnaire collected data on staff
experiences of their work and their relationships with their professional
environment. It used the JCQ elaborated by Karasek4 in order to identify psychosocial risk factors in the workplace.
Three dimensions are explored by this instrument:–The intensity of psychological demands, which is defined as
including workload, intensity and fragmentation of the tasks as perceived
by the staff

–Decisional latitude, which includes the subjects'
perceptions of their own room for control in their decisions concerning
work and their scope for using and developing their skills and
competence

–Social support in the workplace, which is the assistance that the
subject can obtain from his or her superiors or colleagues.




The JCQ questionnaire used in this survey was the validated French version
comprising 26 questions.11 The responses to
the different items are scored from 1 to 4. Scores for decisional latitude,
psychological demands and social support were computed according to the algorithms
recommended by Karasek.4 For each dimension,
when a value was missing, it was replaced with the mean of the other responses
obtained for this subject, as recommended by Bosma et al
12 If more than one response was missing in
the dimension considered, the score was not calculated and that individuals scores
were dropped from the analysis. High and low levels of psychological demands,
decisional latitude and social support were determined by a cut-off point that
corresponded to the medians observed in the sample according to the
recommendations by Karasek.4 We used the
quadrant method explained in the JCQ user's guide to classify job strain
and iso-strain exposure.4 Job strain was
defined by a score greater than the median for psychological demands and a score
below the median on decisional latitude. Three other situations were defined:
active jobs (high levels of psychological demand and high levels of decisional
latitude), passive jobs (low psychological demand and low decisional latitude) and
low-strain jobs (low psychological demand and high decisional latitude).
Iso-strain was defined by job strain associated with a score below the median for
social support.

Statistical analysis
For quantitative variables, distributions are given in means, SD and ranges. For
qualitative variables, results are given in percentages. The comparison of means was
performed using Student's tests, and percentages were compared using
χ2 tests.

According to military status, gender and professional category, the sample was
compared with data from human resources departments of the three hospitals using
χ2 tests.

Work-related information (years in the facility, professional category, department,
working schedules) was synthesised in the form of an occupational profile. In order
to construct the hierarchical variable, ‘occupational profile’ multiple
correspondence analysis (MCA) was used, followed by classification. MCA is a method
of data analysis that is suited to tables in which individuals and qualitative
variables are crossed. It enables the original variables to be replaced by new
synthetic variables (factors). The principle is that it sums up information
concerning the factors by decreasing the number of variables. The objective of the
classification is to group individuals that are close to one another on the basis of
factors retained in the MCA. This yields a hierarchical tree representing the
groupings obtained. The groups obtained are then described according to the
characteristics of the individuals they comprise.

Self-reported health defined by moderate or poor versus good was considered as a
dependant variable and socio-demographic characteristics, occupational profile,
ergonomic score, occupational exposures, work accident or injury and job strain were
considered as independent variables. We hypothesised that psychosocial risk factors
were risk factors for moderate or poor self-reported health after adjustment for
other variables.

The ORs and 95% CIs were estimated using univariable and multivariable analyses of
the determinants of moderate or poor self-reported health. The multivariable analyses
were performed using stepwise descending logistic regression, including the
explicative variables associated with the variable to be explained in univariable
analysis with a significance level below 20%. The final model retained only variables
significatively associated with the dependant variable (p<0.05). All the
presented results were adjusted for hospital. All interactions were tested. Model fit
was ascertained using the Hosmer and Lemeshow test.

The descriptive statistical analyses and the logistic regressions were performed
using STATA V.9® software (Statacorp) and SPAD® software for the
MCA.

Results
Response rates
In all, 3173 questionnaires were distributed to the staff, with 1728 returned
(response rate 54%). Twenty-six could not be used due to missing data.

Compared with overall population, respondents were more often military personnel
(62.3% vs 56.9% in the PMHG), specialised nurse and medicotechnical staff, and less
often technicians (table 1).

Work characteristics
Working conditions
The time already spent working in the facility was 8.4 years on average
(SD=8.2, range 1–43, N=1591) (table 2).

The majority of the staff were liable to work weekends (N=1163, 69.1%) or
nights (N=889, 53.2%). The relation between weekend work and military
status was significant, χ2 (1, N=1677)=312.3,
p<0.001. The proportion of all military staff working weekends was larger
than that for all the civilian staff (84.4% vs 43.1%).

Numerous respondents reported regularly working extra hours without compensation
(N=757, 45.5%).

Among the respondents, 574 reported having positions involving supervising others.
There was a significant effect for gender, χ2 (1,
N=1516)=49.6, p<0.001, 48.4% of all the men had these
functions and only 29.9% of all women. There was also a significant effect for
military status, χ2 (1, N=1583)=74.7,
p<0.001, 44.2% of all military staff had supervisor status versus 22.6% for
all civilian staff.

The distribution of respondents according to professional category is presented in
table 1. The most common professional
category was non-specialised nursing personnel (N=355, 22.3%).

Among departments, medical specialities (N=488), emergency services,
intensive care (N=240, 15.9%) and surgical specialities (N=230,
15.2%) accounted for around 60% of the subsample.

From these variables relating to work characteristics, MCA enabled classification
of 1411 staff across the six following occupational profiles: administrative
(N=289: administrative staff, no weekend or night work, no supervisory
function), technician (N=161: technicians, generally no weekend or night
work, no extra hours, mean time in the facility more than 12 years, no
supervisory function), medical technician (N=183: medical technicians in
radiology, pharmacy and laboratories, no weekend or night work, for the majority
no supervisory function), specialised nurse (N=105: specialised nurses in
anaesthesia, intensive care and surgical specialities, work at nights and
weekends, frequent extra hours and supervisory functions), medical doctor
(N=205: physicians, pharmacists, dentists, work at weekends, frequent extra
hours), nurse and nursing assistant (N=468: nurses and assistant nurses,
work at nights and weekends, mean time in the facility under 6 years). An
occupational profile could not be defined for 291 subjects on account of missing
data.

Ergonomic characteristics and occupational exposure
The highest satisfaction rate (90%) was obtained for the accessibility of the work
post and the lowest rate concerned situations in which physical or verbal
aggression occurred, with only 35% of the staff reporting that they were not
subjected to this type of behaviour (table
2). The overall assessment of the ergonomic environment was expressed by
the variable ergonomic score. For 321 subjects (18.9%), this score was not
satisfactory.

More than half of the respondents (55%) reported exposure to carcinogenic chemical
agents, among whom 26% reported that this was often or always. For ionising
radiations, 45% of the respondents reported exposure, and 18% reported that this
occurred often or always.

Work accident or injury
In the sample (N=1691), the proportion of staff reporting at least one
working accident in the preceding 12 months was 7.8%. The proportion of
accidents leading to sick leave was 3.5%, and the mean duration of sick leave was
24 days (SD=35), ranging from 1 to 150 days. The proportion
of working injury and accidents was significantly different between subjects who
were dissatisfied for their ergonomic score (14.2%), neither satisfied nor
dissatisfied (11.1%) and satisfied for their ergonomic score (5.9%)
χ2 (2, N=1689)=25.7, p<0.001.

Description of psychosocial risk factors
In table 2, results for the score obtained
for the three dimensions ‘decisional latitude’, ‘psychological
demands’ and ‘social support’ are presented. The median values
of these dimension scores enabling identification of situations of job strain and
iso-strain were, respectively, 70, 25 and 24. Among the 1622 subjects for whom the
decisional latitude and psychological demand scores were available, 423 (26.1%) met
the definition of job strain. Among the 1593 subjects for whom decisional latitude
score, psychological demand and social support scores were available, 348 (21.9%) met
the definition for iso-strain.

In figure 1, showing psychological demands on
the abscissa and decisional latitude on the ordinate, sample participants are
positioned according to their occupational profile (table 2). Only the profile ‘nurse and nursing assistant’
appears in the job strain zone. The profile ‘specialised nurse’ was on
the verge of quadrants ‘job strain’ and ‘active
jobs’.

Figure 1 Means of the scores for decisional latitude and psychological demands according
to the occupational profile (N=1702, PMHG 2010).

Description of health status
When staff were asked to assess their general state of health, 1% (N=17)
considered it was very poor, 3.1% (N=53) responded it was poor, 26.9%
(N=455) moderate, 53.6% (N=908) good and 15.4% (N=260) very
good. After recoding with a two-level variable, perceived health was considered
moderate or poor for 31% (N=525) of respondents (table 2). Moderate or poor health status was more often reported
among women, civilian staff, in the 40+ age group, among those with a
non-satisfactory ergonomic score and among those who had had at least one working
accident in the preceding 12 months. According to the occupational profile,
moderate or poor health status was more frequently perceived among technician profile
(43%), and the lowest frequency was among doctors (table 3).

Multivariable analysis

Table 3 presents variables associated with
moderate or poor perceived health in univariable and multivariable analysis. In
multivariable analysis, the following variables were significantly associated:–Military status

–Occupational profile, using doctors as the reference
profile—moderate or poor perceived health was significantly more
often perceived by the profiles nurse and nursing assistant, technician and
administrative

–Ergonomic score

–Work accident or injury

–Job strain




When the variable job strain was replaced in the model by the variable iso-strain,
all the variables were significantly associated with the exception of occupational
exposures (results not shown).

The final model fitted the data (p=0.49), and no interaction was found.

Discussion
In this study on staff in military hospitals in Paris and its urban area, psychosocial
risk factors (job strain and iso-strain) were found to be associated with moderate or
poor perceived health. These associations remained strong even after adjustment on
socio-demographic variables and work characteristics (ergonomic score, occupational
exposures, occupational profile). Among work characteristics, two variables were
associated with moderate or poor perceived health, the ergonomic score and the
occupational profile.

The Karasek model used in this study presents several advantages. It is one of the most
widely used model in the area of workplace health.13–15 In addition, the tool has a French version, and
a medical surveillance risk survey in 2003 (SUMER 2003) enabled verification of its
psychometric qualities in a French population, thus excluding cultural bias and
providing a reference for comparison with other studies.11 Finally, several studies have shown the association between situations of
job strain or iso-strain and cardiovascular disease,16 musculoskeletal disorders17 and
mental illness.18 In our sample, the proportion
of 26% of the personnel in a situation of job strain is derived from the definition of
job strain on the basis of the medians of the scores for psychological demands and
decisional latitude. By construction, it therefore groups around a quarter of the sample
studied. Table 4 presents the scores measured
in the course of this study and in four other studies.19–22 For each of the three dimensions in the
Karasek model, means and medians in our sample were very close to those measured in
Nantes University Hospital (NUH) in 2005.19 In
Geneva University Hospital, the score for psychological demands was of the same order of
magnitude, the score for social support was a little higher and that for decisional
latitude was markedly higher than in the two French studies.20 In relation to scores for French salaried workers as a whole,
measured in the SUMER 2003 report,21 the scores
for psychological demands among hospital staff are higher (NUH, Geneva University
Hospital, PMHG). Scores from a rubber glove factory in Thailand were lower for social
support and for decisional latitude; they are not comparable for psychological demands
because a different scale was used.22 In our
study, nurses and nursing assistants were in job strain situation (figure 1), and this category was similarly classified in the NUH
study. There nursing assistants, administrative staff and non-specialised nurses were
also found to be undergoing job strain.19 In our
sample, the specialised nurses appeared to have more decisional latitude, shown by their
situation on the verge between ‘active job’ and ‘job strain’
situations, while lesser psychological demands placed administrative agents in passive
job situations. Compared with French workers in the SUMER 2003 study, the evaluation of
psychosocial risk factors in the PMHG confirmed the higher level of psychological
demands among hospital staff (table 4).

Concerning the variables descriptive of the workplace, non-typical working hours, night
shifts and working over hours without compensation were frequently reported (70% for
work at weekends, 53% for working at night and 45% for extra hours). In France, in the
public hospital sector in 2006, 60% of the salaried staff were liable to work weekends
(PMHG 70%), 25% of the staff overall worked nights, among whom 40% were doctors and
nurses (PMHG 53%), and 31% reported frequently working over hours (PMHG 45%).23 The larger proportions in our study could be
explained by the relative over-representation of military staff, medicotechnical agents
and specialised nurses (since these categories are the ones that are most often on duty
at night and at the weekend). Apart from extra hours, working at night and during the
weekend are specific to organisational patterns in hospital environments, and these
constraints on social and family life were well accepted by PMHG staff; since in the
items relating to the evaluation of ergonomic aspects, 75% reported that they were
satisfied with their working hours. This acceptation does not, however, protect from
possible effects on health. In the short term, the main effects described in the
literature are nutritional imbalances and sleep disorders. Longer term effects are
subject to more debate, with certain studies concluding to higher rates of morbidity
after the age of 40 and a tendency to an increase in ischaemic cardiac or breast cancer
risk.24–26


In relation to the profile for doctors, our results showed that the probability for a
subject to perceive him/herself to have moderate or poor health status was significantly
greater for all the other profiles except for the specialised nurses and medical
technician. This result is coherent with data in the literature, where it is noted that
subjects with lower educational level or lower income level do not have so positive a
view of their health as subjects with higher educational or income levels.10


Our results also showed a statistical association between a non-satisfactory ergonomic
score and moderate or poor perceived health. The questions relating to the ergonomics of
the work post enabled identification of unsatisfactory situations (handling,
anticipation of material requirements, situations of physical or verbal aggression), and
these results are of the same general order of magnitude and coherent with those in the
literature relating to working conditions among hospital staff. Concerning handling and
carrying, 55% of the respondents reported that they were satisfied in PMHG, 52% in
NUH,19 and in the Presst-Next survey conducted
among staff in healthcare environments in France, means for handling of heavy loads were
considered satisfactory by 48% of the staff questioned.27 The figures for alleged physical or verbal aggression are striking on
account of the scale of the problem, but coherent with data in the report on working
conditions in health facilities in 2003, where 71% of the staff reported that they were
exposed to verbal aggression and 54% reported that they had experienced physical
aggression.28 These hostile behaviours can
have serious repercussions on the psychological well-being of the persons concerned,
showing up in particular in post-traumatic stress disorders which can also damage the
social atmosphere in the facility.29
30


Working accidents can be considered as an indicator of the immediate effects of working
conditions. In the SUMER 2003 report, 4.3% of the workers questioned reported at least
one accident at work followed by sick leave in the 12 months preceding the survey
(vs 3.5% in our study). The mean number of notified days off work was 24 (and 24 in the
PMHG study likewise).31 Thus, the reported
accident rate in our sample was below that reported in SUMER 2003. According to the data
provided by the French health ministry in its 2008 social overview, for salaried workers
as a whole, the mean rate of work accidents is 10.6%.32 In our study, the proportion of work accidents in the previous
12 months (with or without sick leave) was 7.8%. The results of this study also
yielded a work accident rate that was below that of civilian hospitals.

For the assessment of state of health, a subject is considered to be in good health by
OECD for the responses ‘good’ and ‘very good’.10 Although a three-level variable (poor, moderate
and good) would have been more appropriate, this solution was not possible because we
did not have enough people in the poor and very poor perceived health groups. Despite
its very general nature and the apparent subjectivity of the response provided,
perceived health via a single question does appear as a relevant synthetic indicator of
actual health status. In addition, the medical literature reports associations between
perceived poor health and mortality,33–35 current suicidal ideation36 and premature retirement for mental disorder, musculoskeletal disorder and
cardiovascular disease.37 In France, in 2008, 76%
of the population aged 15 years and over were considered to be in good health
compared with 69% in our study. This less favourable perception was in line with similar
recent data relating to the perceived health of staff in civilian hospitals.38


Potential limitations to this study include the cross-sectional nature, so it is not
possible to tell whether moderate or poor perceived health was a result of job strain or
job strain was a result of moderate or poor perceived health, which precludes
identifying causal risk factors for perceived health. However, previous studies
comparing cross-sectional and prospective analyses on the same data have provided
elements supporting at least to some extent the validity of cross-sectional
results.39
40 Another limitation is the moderate rate of
participation and the fact that those with either worse or better perceived health may
have been more likely to participate in the study, therefore, potentially biasing the
results. Also, different response rates between civilian and military staff and between
professional categories raise the issue of selection bias. This selection bias may have
affected the absolute levels of the variables measured. This is illustrated if we
consider the civilian personnel who more frequently did not report good health status
but who were somewhat under-represented in the sample, so that caution is required in
interpreting the level of association observed for the perceived health status variable,
which was significant. Also, a healthy worker effect may have operated, leading to an
underestimation of the associations between occupational factors and moderate or poor
perceived health.

Overall, this study was the first on this scale in military hospital setting, and the
associations evidenced between psychosocial risk factors and perceived health were
measured after adjustment on co-variables, in particular occupational risk factors. One
of the strong points of the study is that it simultaneously explores psychosocial risk
factors and other risk factors as possible determinants of health status. Consequently,
this study efficiently integrated variables linked to the job and also enabled the
collection of considerable data on the feelings and perceptions of staff in their
workplace.

The results have been presented to the staff who, in working groups, gained awareness of
possible effects of a certain number of working situations on their health. They were
thus able to suggest awareness-raising action, adaptations in the field of ergonomics
(for handling, anticipation of material requirements, situations in which aggression
occurs) or in the psychosocial field, such as the participation of all staff categories
in department meetings for the explicit purpose of improving communication, for more
efficient planning of activities and enhanced support from the hierarchy. The discussion
of the results thus altered the perspectives of the staff on their working situations,
which on account of established routine were not seen as presenting a risk (for instance
working nights) and it enabled better compliance of staff with the prevention action
that they themselves initiated.

We are grateful to all participants. We also thank Catherine Besnard for her help in
data collection.
