To quantify the effects of increased cycling on both mortality and morbidity.

Design
Health Impact Assessment.

Setting
Cycling to place of work or education in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Population
Effects were calculated based on the working-age population of Copenhagen.

Main outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was change in burden of disease (measured as
disability-adjusted life years (DALY)) due to changed exposure to the health
determinants physical inactivity, air pollution (particulate matter
<2.5 μm) and traffic accidents.

Results
Obtainment of the proposed increase in cycling could reduce the burden of disease
in the study population by 19.5 DALY annually. This overall effect comprised a
reduction in the burden of disease from health outcomes associated with physical
inactivity (76.0 DALY) and an increase in the burden of disease from outcomes
associated with air pollution and traffic accidents (5.4 and 51.2 DALY,
respectively).

Conclusion
This study illustrates how quantitative Health Impact Assessment can help clarify
potential effects of policies: increased cycling involves opposing effects from
different outcomes but with the overall health effect being positive. This result
illustrates the importance of designing policies that promote the health benefits
and minimise the health risks related to cycling.

==== Body
Introduction
Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for numerous diseases, including
cardiovascular diseases and several cancer forms.1
Active transportation, including transportation by bicycle, is a way of incorporating
physical activity into everyday life and can thus contribute to public health gains by
increasing the level of physical activity in the population. However, cycling also
entails greater risk of accidents and exposure to air pollution.2–4 The aggregated health effect of policies aiming to
increase transportation by bicycle should therefore be estimated prospectively.

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) can be used for this purpose, hereby contributing to
informed policymaking and priority setting. HIA can be used to estimate the health
effects of a broad array of policies or projects in different sectors and have
especially been applied to areas such as transportation, social services and
housing.5
6 Despite the possible advantages of
quantification, most HIAs performed to date have used a qualitative approach.7


Recent studies have shown that the health benefits of cycling outweighed the risks.
However, most of these studies investigated the effects of increased cycling on
mortality only, omitting the effects on morbidity.4
8
9 The aim of this study was to undertake a
quantitative HIA of increased cycling to place of work or education in Copenhagen,
calculating net health effects by summing up positive and negative effects on mortality
and morbidity.

Methods
We performed a quantitative HIA of a policy goal of the City of Copenhagen regarding a
modal shift from car to bicycle. Figure 1 shows
the analytical approach used in the study: left illustrating the overall HIA process and
right showing in more detail the approach used for quantification in the effect analysis
stage. The analysis consisted of two analytical steps: (1) the effect of the policy on
population exposure to determinants of health and (2) the effect of this changed
exposure on population health. We used a Burden of Disease approach to assess the effect
of increased cycling on both mortality and morbidity. The methods and data sources used
for assessing change in exposure and health effects are outlined below.

Figure 1 Overview of the process of health impact assessment with specific focus on
quantitative effect analysis. The left side of the figure shows a generalised
Health Impact Assessment process, while the right side focuses on the effect
analysis stage, involving two subanalyses: (1) the potential effects of the policy
on population (or subpopulation) exposure to selected determinants of health
(changed exposure) were estimated based on an analysis of the policy, study
population characteristic and information on baseline level of exposure to
determinants of health. (2) Next, the potential effect of changed population
exposure to determinants of health on burden of disease was estimated based on the
results of the first subanalysis (change in exposure to health determinants),
information on baseline level of burden of disease from the included health
outcomes and causal effect estimates of the associations between included
determinants of health and health outcomes. The change in burden of disease was
estimated for both each determinant of health and each health outcome and
aggregated for all included health outcomes (model was developed based on7).

Policy proposal and study population
Today, one in three travels to work or place of education in Copenhagen by bicycle.
The target of the City of Copenhagen is to increase this to 50% by 2015.10 As a first step, it has been proposed to
transfer half the car trips of 2–10 km and one-third the car trips of
10–15 km to cycling, which would increase the proportion of cyclists to
42%.10 We tested the health impacts of this
scenario. The study population consisted of all people travelling to place of work or
education in Copenhagen, irrespective of mode of transport (table 1).

Copenhagen, distributed on mode of transport and travel distance, before and

In accordance with the proposed policy goal, no changes were modelled for
distances <2 or ≥15 km, or for other modes of transport
than car and bicycle.

Individual-level data or information regarding specific travel routes was not
available for the study population. This complicated estimation of exposure and
outcome levels and led to the results being reported in absolute numbers for the
study population only, not generalised to the Danish population. To obtain the best
comparability with the study population, exposure data from individuals living in
municipalities within the included travel distance from Copenhagen only were included
in the analysis. Furthermore, the population was limited to the age group
15–69 years since this age group was in best accordance with both the
study purpose and WHO's age-specific estimates of burden of disease.11


Determinants of health
Our main factor of interest was change in travel pattern for people travelling to
place of work or education in Copenhagen on weekdays. The health effect of this
factor was mediated through exposure to specific determinants of health. These
determinants were identified in the scoping stage of the HIA (figure 1). Based on reviews of Danish and international
epidemiological literature on transportation and health,i physical inactivity, air pollution and road traffic accidents were found
to be relevant to include as determinants of health in the effect analysis (figure 2).

Figure 2 Analytical model of the health impact assessment of increased cycling to place
of work or education. The figure illustrates the relationship between policy
proposal, relevant health determinants, health outcomes and aggregated
effect.

Estimation of exposure levels of the included determinants of health before the
proposed policy intervention and calculation of the potential change in exposure due
to a modal shift were based on the following data sources:

Exposure to physical inactivity at baseline was estimated based on
data from a postal health survey from 2010, where physical activity was measured as
minutes spent weekly on moderate or vigorous physical activity during leisure time
and active transportation (see Hammer-Helmich et al,12 specific data extracted for the study
population). Physical activity was not analysed as a continuous variable, but
categorised according to the current recommendations as (1) sufficiently active:
>60 min activity daily, (2) moderately active: 30–60 min
activity daily and (3) inactive: <30 min activity daily,1
13 hereby obtaining agreement with the causal
exposure estimates used in the analysis. The population that could be shifted from
car to bicycle consisted of those who spent <15 min a day on active
transportation at baseline since it was assumed that these did not already cycle to
work or place of education. Change in the proportion of the population being
physically inactive, moderately active and sufficiently active was then calculated
based on the baseline distribution of physical activity and increase in time being
physically active (calculated based on kilometres travelled by bicycle and average
speed of cycling).10


Due to risk of double counting, air pollution was restricted to fine
particulate matter (PM2.5), although evidence suggests that other
components can also affect health.14
15 Baseline exposure level was estimated from
data on PM2.5 concentration in Copenhagen (see Ellermann et
al,16 specific data extracted for
the study population) and information regarding 1 min ventilation,3
17 travel speed,2
10 mode and distance.10 To describe the level of PM2.5 in traffic, the
average value from two street monitoring sites was used
(18.23 μg/m3),16
whereas the average from an urban and a rural background measurement site was used
for non-traffic exposure (13.83 μg/m3).16 For travel speed, we used estimates from a Danish study and
differentiated between car and bicycle (21.0 and 15.8 km/h,
respectively),2 hereby including the health
effect of longer exposure to air pollution when cycling due to lower speed. In
congested traffic, travelling by bicycle can be faster than by motorised transport,
but since the study population travel both within Copenhagen and in the surrounding
municipalities, we applied the average of speed in congested and normal traffic to
describe travel speed by car.2 One-minute
ventilation was calculated as an average of the estimates reported by van Wijnen
et al and Zuurbier et al (12.1 l/min for
car drivers and 26.1 l/min for cyclists).3
17 Change in exposure to air pollution was
calculated based on the changes in travel mode. A possible decrease in the level of
air pollution due to less travel by car was not included in the analysis but is
likely to be an extra benefit of increased travel by bicycle.18
19


Exposure to accidents was calculated as the number of accidents per
million passenger kilometres travelled by bicycle and car, respectively. This was
based on travel data from the Danish National Travel Survey (see Brems and
Munch,20 updated and specified data
extracted for the study population) and police-reported accident data from Statistics
Denmark.21 Change in exposure to accidents
was calculated based on the amount of kilometres shifted to cycling.

Health outcomes
In the scoping stage of the HIA (figure 1),
health outcomes causally associated with the included determinants of health were
identified. Based on the results of WHO's Comparative Quantification of Health
Risks Study and an updated literature search,ii
we included the following: ischaemic heart disease, ischaemic stroke, type II
diabetes, breast cancer, colon cancer, cardiopulmonary diseases, lung cancer and
injuries (figure 2).

Burden of disease
The potential health effect of changed exposure to the included determinants of
health was calculated using a burden of disease approach, applying
disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as the measure of health. DALY is a summary
measure of health, which expresses the combined effect of disability and mortality:
DALYs for a disease or health condition are calculated as the sum of the years of
life lost (YLL) due to premature mortality in the population and the years lost due
to disability (YLD) for incident cases of the health condition.22 This is advantageous when estimating the overall effect of a
policy since the relationship between mortality and disability often varies for
different outcomes.23
24 DALY valuates diagnosed health states,
hereby enabling the estimations to be based on epidemiological evidence of
disease-specific associations, impact calculations and WHO's calculations of
burden of disease, leading to higher comparability and validity.25 There is, however, ongoing discussion regarding the use of
DALY, especially due to the value judgements involved, for example, discounting and
age weighting.26
27


Burden of disease in the study population before an increase in cycling was
calculated using WHO's burden of disease estimates for Denmark.28 To account for the selected age groups in the
study population, the Danish estimates were adjusted for the age distribution of
burden of disease in WHO subregion EUR-A (consisting of Denmark and other Western
European countries).11 This distribution was
used since age-specific estimates of burden of disease are not available at country
level. Estimates of burden of disease were calculated for all health outcomes
included in the analysis (see table 3 for
baseline estimates and notes regarding specific calculations).

A preliminary calculation of burden of disease in Copenhagen has shown that the
burden of disease from accidents was lower in Copenhagen and surrounding
municipalities than in Denmark overall.29 The
baseline estimate of burden of disease from accidents was therefore adjusted to
account for this difference. No differences were found for the other outcomes
included in our analysis.29


Change in burden of disease was calculated using the potential impact fraction (PIF),
an epidemiological method to estimate the effect of an exposure on population health,
expressed as the change in incidence of disease if an exposure is modified.30
31 PIF was calculated for each of the included
associations between determinants of health and health outcomes. Calculation of PIF
requires information regarding the proportion of the population being exposed before
and after the intervention and estimates of the RR for each exposure category of the
included associations.

Estimates of RR from WHO's Comparative Quantification of Health Risks study
were used to describe the association between physical inactivity or air pollution
and associated health outcomes (table
2).1
14 For air pollution, the RR estimates were
transformed to account for differences in air pollution exposure due to differences
in duration (travel speed), concentration and ventilation between car drivers and
cyclists (applying the method described by de Hartog et al).4

* Burden of disease for the study population was calculated based on
WHO's estimates of burden of disease in Denmark,28 allowing for the absolute size of the population
(437 000 people) and the age groups included. Age was adjusted using
the age distribution of burden of disease from WHO subregion EUR-A11 since age-specific estimates are not
available at country level.

† WHO's estimate of burden of disease from stroke covers both ischaemic
and haemorrhagic stroke. However, only ischaemic stroke was associated with
physical inactivity.1 Assuming equal
burden of disease from the two outcomes, burden of disease from ischaemic
stroke was calculated as the relative share of ischaemic stroke in Denmark
(80%–85%).33


‡ WHO estimates the total burden of disease from type I and II diabetes. Due
to differences in the duration of type I and type II diabetes, the burden of
disease from type II diabetes alone is difficult to estimate. WHO's
estimate was therefore used. We did not expect this to introduce great
uncertainty, since type II diabetes accounts for 85%–90% of diabetes
cases in Denmark.33


§ WHO estimates burden of disease from colorectal cancer. However, only colon
cancer was associated with physical inactivity.1 Assuming equal burden of disease from the two outcomes,
burden of disease from colon cancer was calculated as the proportion of
colorectal cancers in Denmark made up of colon cancer (71.8%).34


¶ WHO estimates the total burden of disease from road traffic accidents.
Assuming the same relative severity of accidents involving different travel
modes, burden of disease in the population due to bicycle and car accidents
was calculated based on the distribution of accidents in Denmark (60.5%
bicycle or car accidents)21 and
adjusted for lower burden of disease from accidents in Copenhagen and
surrounding municipalities than in Denmark overall.29


** Change in burden of disease from ischaemic heart disease was affected by
both physical inactivity and air pollution. Therefore, the total burden of
disease did not equal the sum of burden of disease from the individual
outcomes.

DALY, disability-adjusted life years; PIF, potential impact fraction.

Due to the complexity of traffic accidents and the many possible injury outcomes, no
studies have estimated the RR associated with bicycle accidents. The risk of travel
by bicycle relative to car was therefore calculated for the study population as the
ratio of the injury rates per million kilometres travelled by bicycle and car,
respectively (table 2).

For each of the included health outcomes, change in burden of disease was calculated
based on the PIF and the burden of disease at baseline
(BoDafter=BoDbaseline(1 − PIF)).32 For each determinant of health, the related
burden of disease was calculated as the sum of the burden of disease estimates from
all health outcome associated with this determinant of health. Lastly, the overall
change in burden of disease in the study population was calculated by summing the
estimates of change in burden of disease from all included health outcomes.

Results
Overall, the proposed policy intervention would change the share of cyclists from 35.5%
to 42.4%. Pre-intervention 28.9% of the population was inactive, 29.5% moderately active
and 41.6% sufficiently active. Obtainment of a shift in travel mode would change this
distribution to 25.5%, 30.2% and 44.2%, respectively. For air pollution, people
travelling by bicycle were exposed to a concentration of PM2.5 of
15.7 μg/m3, while people travelling by car were exposed to
18.2 μg/m3 PM2.5. The number of fatal or serious
injuries was 0.18 and 0.01 per million kilometres travelled by bicycle or car,
respectively.


Table 3 shows the pre-intervention and
post-intervention annual burden of disease in the study population. If the proposed
increase in cycling could be reached, the burden of disease could be reduced by 19.5
DALY (from 13 625.6 to 13 606.1 DALY). For outcomes related to physical
inactivity, the burden of disease decreased by 76.0 DALY (from 5634.8 to 5558.7 DALY),
whereas the burden of disease from outcomes related to air pollution and traffic
accidents increased by 5.4 DALY (from 9784.3 to 9789.7 DALY) and 51.2 DALY (from 303.2
to 354.3 DALY), respectively.

To test the robustness of our results, we carried out selected sensitivity analyses
(results not shown). We tested the uncertainty associated with the RR estimates used, by
calculating the burden of disease based on upper and lower 95% CI limits. This ranged
from 13.8 DALY using low RR to 24.3 DALY using high RR estimates.

In the analysis, we assumed that change in travel mode was independent of current level
of leisure-time physical activity. We tested what the potential health effect would have
been if it was assumed that all those shifted to cycling were physically inactive at
baseline. This would lead to a fourfold increase in the health gain compared with the
primary analysis, decreasing the burden of disease by 90.2 DALY.

Finally, we tested the implications of our assumption of equal outcome severity from
bicycle and car accidents. To do this, we calculated PIF for fatal and non-fatal
accidents, respectively, based on the relative share of bicycle and car accidents of all
fatal and non-fatal traffic accidents and estimates of risk of travel by bicycle
relative to car for fatal and non-fatal accidents. We then split the burden of disease
from traffic accidents in terms of years of life lost (YLL) and years lost due to
disability (YLD), based on the distribution of YLL and YLD in the burden of disease from
traffic accidents in WHO's subregion EUR-A since estimates of YLL and YLD are not
available at country level.11 This calculation
showed that fatal accidents caused 39.8 DALY and non-fatal accidents caused 9.8 DALY,
summing to a total of 49.5 DALY: a slightly lower increase in burden of disease than
found in the main analysis (51.2 DALY).

Discussion
Principal findings
Our results showed that if the share of people travelling to work or place of
education by bicycle increased from 35% to 42%, the burden of disease in the study
population would decrease. This overall effect was composed of a reduction in the
burden of disease from health outcomes associated with physical inactivity and an
increase in the burden of disease from outcomes associated with air pollution and
bicycle accidents. Our results thus showed that increased cycling was associated with
both positive and negative effects that partly cancelled out. This result illustrates
the importance of designing policies that promote the health benefits and minimise
the health risks related to cycling.

Our overall result, that the positive health effects of increased cycling outweigh
the negative effects, agrees with the findings of other studies that have estimated
the effects of cycling.4

18
35 However, compared with de Hartog et
al
4 and Rojas-Rueda et al,8 we found a relatively larger effect of
accidents, as was also found by Woodcock et al
18 This might be explained by many bicycle
accidents being non-fatal since the studies by Hartog et al
4 and Rojas-Rueda et al
8 only analysed the effects of cycling on
mortality.

Our results showed a smaller health effect of increased cycling than found by de
Hartog et al and Woodcock et al
4
18 However, these studies modelled changes in
larger fictive populations, whereas we modelled the potential effects of a real
policy goal formulated by the City of Copenhagen. This is in line with Rojas-Rueda
et al
8 who estimated the effects of an implemented
intervention. Compared with the scenarios analysed in the studies by Lindsay
et al
9 and Rabl et al
35 our study included longer commuter trips
(up to 15 km). This could result in larger health benefits for the individual,
but might also make it harder to obtain the stated policy.

The study by Rojas-Rueda et al has been criticised for overstating
the increase in physical activity attributable to the bicycle scheme analysed.36 In our analysis, we assumed that only people
spending l<15 min a day on active transportation at baseline could be
shifted to cycling. We did not assume that all people shifted from driving to cycling
were physically inactive at baseline but included estimates of the baseline
distribution of physical activity in the study population to account for existing
activity. Our sensitivity analysis showed that the health gain could be increased
fourfold if the entire population shifted to cycling changed their level of physical
activity from inactive to moderately or sufficiently active. This might account for
some of the lower benefit of physical activity found in our study compared with other
studies.4
9 This also illustrates the importance of
motivating currently inactive commuters to use active transportation.

Methodological strengths and weaknesses
Where possible, our modelling of the effects of cycling was based on local data;
however, a general limitation when performing impact assessments is data
availability. We were only able to include associations between determinants of
health and health outcomes for which there was quantifiable evidence. This meant that
health effects of, for example, stress and other psychosocial exposures were not
included in the analysis, although there is some evidence that these outcomes could
be affected by a change in mode of transport.37
38 This might imply that the health benefits
from increased cycling could be greater than shown by our analysis. When modelling
the possible future impacts, it was necessary to make assumptions. The influence of
selected central assumptions was tested in sensitivity analyses (described
above).

The associations between the included determinants of health and health outcomes were
described using estimates of RR. Estimates from the WHO study Comparative
Quantification of Health Risks were used for health outcomes related to physical
inactivity and air pollution.1
14 These estimates were based on reviews and
meta-analyses and provided high validity.

Evidence on the precise relation between increase in cyclists and change in accident
incidence is on the other hand lacking.39
40 The RR of injuries was therefore calculated
from the accident rate per million kilometres travelled by bicycle versus car, based
on register and survey data (see Brems and Munch20 (updated and specified data extracted for the study population) and
statistics Denmark21). Thus, there is greater
uncertainty attached to the estimates of change in burden of disease from injuries
than from the other health outcomes included in the analysis. Research on
transportation and safety has indicated the possibility of a safety-in-numbers
effect, where a higher proportion of cyclists are associated with a relatively lower
risk of accidents.40
41 In our calculations, this effect was not
assumed since there is lack of knowledge on the precise association between cyclist
numbers and accident risk. It can also be questioned if the trend will continue to
exist above a certain amount of cyclists, when drivers and bicyclists learn to
coexist, or whether the effect is due to a focus on traffic management rather than
the sheer number of cyclists.42 However, in
recent years in Copenhagen, the number of cyclists has increased and the number of
accidents has decreased,10 proposing that our
estimate of the change in burden of disease from accidents might be overestimated.
This indicates a need for further research on bicycle accidents and the association
between increased numbers of cyclists, safety and accident trends.

Traffic accidents can result in a wide range of health outcomes resulting in very
different burden of disease. We did not have knowledge on the exact injury outcomes
but calculated the burden of disease from accidents based on WHO's estimate of
burden of disease from road traffic accidents, which also includes a diverse mix of
outcomes, and the relative distribution of traffic accidents involving different road
users and vehicles in Denmark. We, thus, assumed equal outcome severity from bicycle
and car accidents. In the sensitivity analyses, we tested the implications of this
assumption by separating fatal and non-fatal accidents. This analysis suggested that
our results might have slightly overestimated the burden of disease from bicycle
accidents. However, the main analysis was not separated into relative contributions
from mortality and morbidity due to lack of country-specific data on YLL and
YLD.11


Only bicycle and car accidents that caused police-reported fatal or serious injuries
were included in the analysis due to non-complete registration of accidents causing
mild injuries.43 We believe that this did not
affect our results greatly since reporting of accidents causing fatal or serious
injuries, which contributes mostly to the burden of disease, is almost complete.43


We used the PIF to calculate change in population health due to changes in exposure
to selected health determinants. For health outcomes affected by several
determinants, fractional measures such as PIF can sum to more than one, implying that
more than 100% of disease cases are preventable.44 This problem arises when exposures interact. To avoid overestimation,
the potential preventive effect should be calculated sequentially. In our analysis,
only the health outcome ischaemic heart disease was affected by more than one of the
included health determinants. For this outcome, the change in burden of disease was
calculated for both possible sequences of changed exposure, which did not alter the
results. We assumed that burden of disease from outcomes related to the same
determinant of health was not affected by comorbidity, an assumption also applied by
WHO in calculations of burden of disease.27


The approach presented here is a fairly simple model of calculation that does not
include a time dimension, competing risks or demographic factors. Furthermore, the
calculations were based on expected changes in incidence, whereas changes in duration
or severity (disability weights) were not included. However, with modest data
requirements, it gives an estimate of the potential health effects of a policy
proposal.

Our results and the methods applied have certain limitations, which points towards
future research questions. These include further development of methods for
quantitative HIAs and how to better include social and psychological health effects
in quantitative assessments. Other important research areas relate more specifically
to transportation and the systemic nature of transport. This includes a specific need
for further research on accidents and the association between numbers of cyclists and
risk of accidents and also the wider implications of transport such as effects on
climate change, access to goods and services and social connection in
communities.

Conclusions
Decision makers or stakeholders often request quantified estimates of the potential
effects of prospective policies or projects. Our study illustrates an approach to
quantitative risk assessment in HIA, and our results showed that it could have
overall beneficial health effects to reach the preliminary aim of the City of
Copenhagen of 42% cycling among those travelling to work or place of education.
Numerically, the net health effect was moderate, which was partly due to the modelled
scenario only including a relatively small population. Partly this was also a result
of the burden of disease from health outcomes related to physical inactivity
decreasing while the burden of disease from outcomes related to air pollution and
accidents increased. The potential health gain was, however, more than a third larger
than the potential health loss.

Our result, where positive and negative effects partly cancelled out, illustrates how
quantitative HIA can help clarify the underlying elements that contribute to the
effects of a policy. This result points to the policy relevant conclusion that it is
important to focus on improving cycling safety and reducing the exposure of cyclists
to air pollution. This would enhance the health gains potentially obtainable through
increased cycling.

We would like to thank the Research Centre for Prevention and Health, Capital Region of
Denmark, the Technical and Environmental Administration, City of Copenhagen and the
Department of Transport, Technical University of Denmark for providing data.
