One of the most challenges in diabetic patients is learning how to glycemic control. Evidence based care is proper, correct and intellectual use of the best evidence in clinical decision making for every single patient care. This study aimed to determine the effect of evidence based care on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.

Methods
This study was a clinical randomized controlled trial which conducted on sixty diabetic type 2 patients. Patients were divided in two groups of intervention and control. Nursing interventions based (exercise & nutrition) on a review of the literature. Data were collected using questionnaire and checklist before and three months after the intervention. Data were analyzed using SPSS/20.

Results
The results showed that after evidence based care, fasting plasma glucose test in the intervention group than in control group, the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05)

Conclusion
With designing evidence-based nursing care instructions for type-2 diabetic patients, the need of clinical nurses in confronting these patients was removed. It also leads to improve the quality of care and reduce complications in duration of the hospital stay.
