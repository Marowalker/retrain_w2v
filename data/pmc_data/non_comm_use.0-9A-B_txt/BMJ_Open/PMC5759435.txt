See: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/Polidocanol is approved for its competence in treatment of varicose veins and spider veins; however, unfortunately, many of its off-label uses are still underappreciated. Lack of an appropriate comprehensive review for off-label uses of this medication troubles physicians about making evidence-based decisions on prescribing it for its various outstanding off-label uses. This article attempts to provide physicians with the latest information concerning successful and unsuccessful use of polidocanol as an alternative treatment for esophageal and gastric varices, tendinopathy and epicondylitis, vascular malformations, varicocele, hydrocele and spermatocele, aneurysmal bone cysts, Itching, management of gastrointestinal bleeding, simple renal cysts, reducing the incidence and severity of radio-induced dermatitis, and hemorrhoids. Polidocanol eligibility as an alternative prescription, in comparison to other standard medications in each condition, is also discussed meticulously afterwards in this paper.
