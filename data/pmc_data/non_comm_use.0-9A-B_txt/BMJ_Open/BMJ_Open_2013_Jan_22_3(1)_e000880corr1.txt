1. In the ‘Results’ section of the abstract, ‘older age’ should have read ‘younger age’.

2. In the third paragraph of the ‘Introduction’ section, ‘developing world’ should have read ‘developed world’.

3. In the ‘Predictors of statin discontinuation’ section on page 4, ‘older age’ should have read ‘younger age’.
