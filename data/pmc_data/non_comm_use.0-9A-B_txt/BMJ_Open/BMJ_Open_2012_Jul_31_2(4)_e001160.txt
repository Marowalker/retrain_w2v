To measure the receptive risks of malaria in Somalia and compare decisions on
intervention scale-up based on this map and the more widely used contemporary risk
maps.

Design
Cross-sectional community Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate
(PfPR) data for the period 2007–2010 corrected to a
standard age range of 2 to <10 years
(PfPR2–10) and used within a Bayesian
space–time geostatistical framework to predict the contemporary (2010) mean
PfPR2–10 and the maximum annual mean
PfPR2–10 (receptive) from the highest
predicted PfPR2–10 value over the study period
as an estimate of receptivity.

Setting
Randomly sampled communities in Somalia.

Participants
Randomly sampled individuals of all ages.

Main outcome measure
Cartographic descriptions of malaria receptivity and contemporary risks in Somalia
at the district level.

Results
The contemporary annual PfPR2–10 map estimated
that all districts (n=74) and population (n=8.4 million) in Somalia
were under hypoendemic transmission (≤10%
PfPR2–10). Of these, 23% of the districts,
home to 13% of the population, were under transmission of <1%
PfPR2–10. About 58% of the districts and 55%
of the population were in the risk class of 1% to <5%
PfPR2–10. In contrast, the receptivity map
estimated 65% of the districts and 69% of the population were under mesoendemic
transmission (>10%–50% PfPR2–10)
and the rest as hypoendemic.

Conclusion
Compared with maps of receptive risks, contemporary maps of transmission mask
disparities of malaria risk necessary to prioritise and sustain future control. As
malaria risk declines across Africa, efforts must be invested in measuring
receptivity for efficient control planning.

Article summary
Article focus
Cross-sectional PfPR prevalence survey data for the period
2007–2010 in Somalia.

Bayesian geostatistical models estimating the receptive and contemporary
malaria transmission in Somalia.

Implications of the two malaria risk maps for malaria control planning in
Somalia.

Key messages
It is feasible to use PfPR community prevalence data in space
and time to estimate the receptive and contemporary risks of malaria within the
same model framework.

Malaria receptivity maps are critical to inform the scale-up and sustaining of
interventions where disease has declined or is highly seasonal.

Efforts must be invested in helping malaria endemic countries in Africa measure
their receptive risks.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The annual PfPR surveys provide unique opportunities to
measure receptivity in Somalia.

Improving the spatial and temporal distributions of PfPR data
and exploring probabilistic approaches of selecting potential maximum risks
will improve the measurement of receptivity.
==== Body
Introduction
Malaria receptivity is a measure of the intrinsic vector transmission potential of an
area.1 Interest in measuring malaria
receptivity has emerged following the resurgence of the malaria elimination agenda2
3 and the need to quantify the risks posed by
human population movement leading to the reintroduction of transmission.4
5 However, understanding receptivity is equally
important to decision-making for countries that are implementing control. In low stable
endemic countries, national programmes need to understand the risks posed by withdrawal
of interventions from areas that are historically high transmission.3
6 In unstable transmission areas where parasite
exposure is highly seasonal and prone to climatic anomalies, targeting interventions to
prevent the risk of epidemics are a priority.1 The
empirical malaria risk maps that are commonly available to countries to support malaria
control planning are those that represent the contemporary distribution of risk under
control7
8 and are therefore of limited value in defining
the epidemic potential or the receptive rebound risks of withdrawing or failing to
sustain interventions.

Measuring receptivity for malaria control countries ideally requires empirical data from
a period of no control and under the optimum transmission conditions. There is hardly
any country in Africa that has remained universally control-naive over the past
100 years.9 Alternatively, nationally
representative empirical data on malaria transmission during the pre-Roll Back Malaria
(RBM) era, or before intervention scale-up reached critical thresholds for a given
country, may represent the best approximation of receptivity. Furthermore, such
information must be resolved to administrative decision-making units to which malaria
resources are allocated to make them relevant for policy. In this study, we use
community Plasmodium falciparum parasite prevalence data from 2007 to
2010 within a model-based geostatistical (MBG) framework to develop contemporary and
receptive risk maps and resolve endemicity to districts in Somalia.

Methods
Country context
Somalia is divided into the three zones of North West (Somaliland), North East
(Puntland) and Central South (figure 1). The
northern zones are generally dry and hot, whereas the Central South zone has
subtropical climate and is where the two major rivers of the country, the Shabelle
and the Juba, are located.10
11
Anopheles arabiensis is the dominant malaria transmitting vector
throughout the country, although Anopheles funestus is reported in
Central South.12
13
P falciparum is the dominant species of the malaria parasite.14–16 The presence of
Plasmodium vivax cases have also been reported with studies in
Somaliland showing relatively high vivax antibody responses.17 The failure of the long rains in Somalia in 2010 combined with
the below average rainfalls in previous two seasons have resulted in a severe
drought.11

Since 1991, Somalia has had no effective central government and has experienced
frequent internal armed conflicts resulting in the breakdown of public services and
political disintegration.18 Although the
transitional federal government, formed in February 2004, is internationally
recognised as the official government of Somalia,19 in reality the three zones currently function as semi-independent
states. Consequently, there are three ministries of health, but the majority of
healthcare is provided by international and national non-government organisations
that have come together under the umbrella of Somalia Aid Coordinating Board, which
was later reformed as the Somalia Support Secretariat.20


The main funder of malaria control in Somalia is the Global Fund to Fight Aids TB and
Malaria with the United Nations Children Fund (Unicef) as the principal recipient and
the WHO as subrecipient.21
22 In 2010, the second national malaria
strategy was launched with universal scale-up of vector control, parasitological
diagnosis, effective antimalarials, improved surveillance and epidemic preparedness
and response as the main strategic approaches.22
23 Since 2004, over US$77 million has
been approved to Somalia by the Global Fund to Fight Aids TB and Malaria for malaria
control resulting in the distribution of almost 1 million long-lasting insecticidal
nets (LLINs).24


Community survey data
The community P falciparum parasite rate (PfPR) is
the most commonly used indicator for mapping malaria transmission.7 This is because it is easy to measure, has a
historical legacy and a predictable relationship with other measures of transmission
intensity, such as entomological inoculation rate and the basic reproductive
rate.25
26 The PfPR data used for the
present study were assembled through the Food and Agriculture
Organization–Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FAO-FSNAU) surveys
undertaken regularly in Somalia.16
27 These surveys were initially established to
monitor the nutritional status of children <5 years of age and began in
2000.27 Investigations of malaria
prevalence covering persons of all ages were only included from 200716 and have been undertaken annually since
covering most regions of Somalia. A detailed description of the sampling design is
provided elsewhere.16 During the survey,
respondents provided a finger prick blood sample that was examined for the presence
of P falciparum infection using a rapid diagnostic test (Paracheck
Pf, Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India). Consent was obtained for all individuals
before interview and separately for the malaria testing. Additional information was
recorded on the date of survey and age and sex of participants. After all survey data
were assembled, each surveyed community was geo-coded using combinations of global
positioning systems, electronic gazetteers (Google Earth, Encarta and Alexandria) and
other sources of longitude and latitude such as a settlement database collated by
FAO-SWALIM.11


Assessment of ecological and climatic predictors of malaria risk
The transmission intensity of malaria is influenced by climatic and ecological
factors through their independent or combined effects on the survival of the
Anopheline vectors and the Plasmodium parasites within the vector.28 The ecological and climatic factors used
commonly to improve the precision of empirical malaria mapping are urbanisation,
rainfall, temperature and distance to potential mosquito larva breeding sites.

Data at 1×1 km spatial resolution on urbanisation,29 annual mean precipitation30
31 and enhanced vegetation index32 were assembled. Maps of rivers, flood plains,
reservoirs and coastal wetlands were assembled from the Global Wetlands and Lakes
Database33 and Euclidean distances to these
proximates of breeding sites were computed in ArcGIS 10 (ESRI Inc., New York, USA).
As a metric for the effect of temperature on malaria transmission, a temperature
suitability index (TSI) at a spatial resolution of 1×1 km was used. TSI
was constructed using monthly temperature time series within a biological modelling
framework to quantify the effect of ambient temperature on sporogony and vector
survivorship and determine the suitability of an area to support transmission
globally.34 The values of the underlying
ecological and climatic covariates were extracted to each survey location using
ArcGIS 10 Spatial Analyst tool. Distance to potential breeding sites
was log-transformed before analysis because of its high positive skew. The covariates
were then included in total-sets analysis, which is an automatic model selection
process based on a generalised linear regression model and implemented using the
bestglm package in R.35
36 This approach selects the best combination
of the covariates based on the value of the Bayesian Information Criteria
statistic,37 which selects the lowest
Bayesian Information Criteria as the best model fit. Details of the ecological and
climatic predictors of PfPR and the results of the total-set
analysis are provided in supplementary information 1.

The space–time Bayesian geostatistical model for predicting P
falciparum distribution in Somalia
Space–time MBG methods offer the flexibility of predicting an outcome to any
given year and location in a time series by harnessing fully both the spatial and
temporal relationships of the data and generate uncertainties of the predictions from
the full posterior distributions.38


In this study, the assembled PfPR data were standardised to the
classical age range of 2 to <10 years using an algorithm based on
modified catalytic conversion models.39 The
continuous surfaces of the age-standardised data
(PfPR2–10) were generated using a
space–time MBG framework8
40 whereby Bayesian inference was implemented
using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Details of model code40 and statistical procedures8 are provided in supplementary information 2. In
brief, the value of PfPR2–10 was modelled as a
transformation of a spatiotemporally structured field superimposed with unstructured
(random) variation on a regular 1×1 km grid from 2007 to 2010. The
number of P falciparum-positive responses from the total sample at
each survey location was modelled as a conditionally independent binomial variate
given the unobserved underlying age-standardised
PfPR2–10 value39 and a linear function of the climatic and environmental predictors. The
unstructured component was represented as Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The
spatiotemporal component was represented by a stationary Gaussian process41 with covariance defined by a spatially
anisotropic version of the space–time covariance function proposed by Stein
(2005).42 To partly model seasonality, the
covariance function was modified to allow the time-marginal model to include a
periodic component of wavelength 12 months in the temporal covariance
structure. Each survey was referenced temporally using the midpoint (in decimal
years) between the recorded start and end months. For each grid location, samples of
the annual mean of the full posterior distribution of
PfPR2–10 for each year were generated. These
PfPR2–10 samples were then used to generate
continuous maps of the annual mean. To determine the probable maximal malaria risk,
the highest value of predicted mean annual
PfPR2–10 value at each 1×1 km
grid location over the period 2007–2010 were extracted. These were then
combined to generate a single map of maximum mean
PfPR2–10.

Assessing uncertainty of model predictions
As a first step to understanding the uncertainty around the predictions of
PfPR2–10 using the Bayesian geostatistical
model, the continuous mean maps were accompanied by estimates of the posterior
standard deviation (SD). For the maximum mean
PfPR2–10 map, the posterior SDs associated with
the selected mean value was used. To allow for a scaled comparison of the uncertainty
of the 2010 PfPR2–10 map and the 2010 annual mean
PfPR2–10, the coefficient of variation, which
is a measure of dispersal around the mean,43
was computed as the ratio of the SD to the mean. Higher values of the coefficient of
variation suggest increasing uncertainty of model predictions. In addition, a
spatially representative validation set of
PfPR2–10 survey data were also selected using a
spatially declustered sampling algorithm.40
The annual predictions were then repeated in full using the remaining data to predict
mean PfPR2–10 at the validation locations. The
ability of the model to predict point values of PfPR at unsampled
locations was quantified using two simple summary statistics: the mean prediction
error (MPE) and the mean absolute prediction error (MAPE). The MPE provides a measure
of the model bias, while the MAPE is a measure of the average accuracy of individual
predictions.

Defining district-level malaria endemicity and population at risk
A 2010 population surface for Somalia at 100×100 m spatial resolution
was provided by the AfriPop project.29
44 Using this map, estimates of the total
population of each 1×1 km pixel to which mean
PfPR2–10 was predicted was computed in ArcGIS
10. The 1×1 km grid squares with attached population estimates were
further classified separately by the mean PfPR2–10
2010 and the maximum mean PfPR2–10. To weight
endemicity for population distribution, only those grid squares with population were
retained and from these the mean PfPR2–10 was
computed for each district. Based on the aggregate mean
PfPR2–10, districts were then classified using
a modification of the classical malaria endemicity classification.45 The hypoendemic class (≤10%
PfPR2–10) was split into <1%
PfPR2–10; 1% to <5%
PfPR2–10 and 5%–10%
PfPR2–10. The endemicity class of <1%
PfPR2–10 represents the threshold at which an
area is considered to be under low stable endemic control and a decision for
sustaining control or aiming for elimination can be made.3
6 The hyperendemic (>50%–75%
PfPR2–10) and holoendemic (>75%
PfPR2–10) classes were also combined, while the
mesoendemic class (>10%–50%
PfPR2–10) remained unchanged. The number of
districts and population by these endemicity classes were then summarised based on
both the 2010 mean PfPR2–10 (contemporary risk)
map and the maximum mean PfPR2–10 (receptive risk)
map.

Results
Predictions of mean annual PfPR2–10 to 2010
and maximum mean posterior PfPR2–10

A total of 1558 P falciparum community surveys (figure 1) in which 103 593 persons were examined were
assembled for the period 2007–2011 in Somalia. The majority of the data were
located in the Central South zone where most of the population live. Survey data were
collected across nine different months over the 5 years, with the majority of
data (76%) assembled in the months of November, December, May and June corresponding
to the peak malaria seasons in Somalia. The results of the total-set analysis showed
that the model with urbanisation, precipitation, enhanced vegetation index and
distance to main water bodies and flood plains as the best fit in predicting
PfPR, and these variables were subsequently included in the
malaria prediction model (supplementary information 1). TSI was not selected as a
statistically strong predictor of P falciparum prevalence in
Somalia.

The continuous 2010 malaria endemicity map for Somalia
PfPR2–10 showed the majority of locations were
predicted to have parasite prevalence of <5% indicating largely hypoendemic
transmission (figure 2A). The majority of
areas in North East and North West zones were predicted to be under
PfPR2–10 <1%. In contrast, the maximum
annual mean PfPR2–10 map showed a substantially
different risk landscape, with the majority of the Central South zone having
PfPR2–10 of >10% and an a maximum
predicted mean of 38%, suggesting that peak malaria transmission in all of Central
South zone and southern parts of North East zone is mesoendemic (figure 2B). In the northern zones, maximum mean risks were
predicted to be predominantly between 5% and <10%
PfPR2–10.

uncertainties of the PfPR2–10 predictions.
The scale bar for the continuous PfPR2–10
ends at 50, which is the upper limit of mesoendemic transmission. The blues
lines show the location of the Juba (lower) and Shabelle (upper) Rivers.

The MPE and MAPE associated with the full space–time geostatistical model was
4.8% and 0.2%, respectively. The 2010 annual mean
PfPR2–10 predictions were associated with
higher coefficients of variation compared with the maximum mean
PfPR2–10 predictions, although the difference
was moderate (figure 2C,D). In both maps,
uncertainty appeared highest in northern zones where data in space and time were
fewest.

District estimates of contemporary and receptive malaria risk
According to the contemporary district malaria endemicity map based on the annual
mean PfPR2–10 map of 2010, all districts in
Somalia were under hypoendemic transmission (figure
3A). Of the 74 districts, an estimated 17 (23%) districts covering about
1.1 million people (13%) were in the <1%
PfPR2–10 risk class (table 1 and figure 3A).
The majority of the districts (58%) and population (55%) were in the risk class of
1%–<5% PfPR2–10 and the rest were
under risks of 5%–10% PfPR2–10.

PfPR2–10. About 27% of the districts and 17% of
the population were in the upper range of hypoendemicity (5%–10%
PfPR2–10). The rest of the districts and
population were in the intermediate hypoendemic class of 1%–<5%
PfPR2–10.


Discussion
The malaria risk maps that are commonly available to countries in Africa to support
malaria control planning are those that represent the contemporary distribution of
risk.8
16
46–50 They have been
developed primarily from geo-coded parasite rate survey data7 usually to predict risk to the most recent data year and therefore
reflect transmission under scaled interventions during the era of the RBM
partnership.51
52 In this study, we argue that, in addition to
contemporary maps of malaria risks, low stable endemic control and unstable transmission
countries require maps of receptivity to assess the risks of rebound and epidemics and
decide on where to scale-up and/or sustain intervention coverage. To demonstrate this,
we used community PfPR survey data from the period 2007–2010
within a space–time MBG framework to generate two continuous malaria risk maps
for Somalia. One is a contemporary map of annual mean
PfPR2–10 predicted to 2010 (figure 2A) and the other is the maximum annual mean
PfPR2–10 map derived from the highest mean
PfPR2–10 value predicted to a location in any year
over the study period to approximate receptivity (figure
2B). We resolved these maps to the district, which is the malaria
decision-making unit in Somalia, and classified them by endemicity using
population-weighted mean PfPR2–10 (figure 3).

The efficacy and impact of malaria interventions on disease in an area are dependent on
its intrinsic transmission potential.53–55 This is the theoretical basis upon which international
guidelines for malaria control are formulated.1
56 One of the most important applications of
malaria risk maps for control planning, therefore, is to inform the spatial targeting of
the appropriate mixes of interventions.57 For
Somalia, the results of the comparison of the contemporary and the receptive risk maps
represents two very different transmission scenarios (table 1 and figure 3). The
contemporary malaria risk map predicted that all of Somalia was under conditions of
hypoendemic transmission (≤10% PfPR2–10) in
2010 with a fifth of the districts under risks of <1%
PfPR2–10, while the majority of the districts and
population were in the intermediate hypoendemic transmission class of 1% to <5%
PfPR2–10. Under these transmission conditions,
targeted distribution of LLINs and indoor residual spraying aimed at control of residual
foci are recommended, while intermittent presumptive treatment in pregnancy is not.56 Instead of being part of the broader monitoring
and evaluation process, disease surveillance is also regarded as an intervention in of
itself1 comprising high-quality passive case
detection, case notification and active case detection in which all febrile cases within
proximity of the index case are tested and those positive for malaria infection are
radically treated.58 In the districts where
transmission is <1% PfPR2–10, malaria
elimination is considered to be technically feasible3
6 presenting an opportunity to re-orient the
subnational strategy here towards elimination and undertake an assessment of its
operational feasibility.5 In contrast, the
receptive risk map predicted that over 65% of the districts and population were under
mesoendemic transmission (>10%–50%
PfPR2–10) with the rest exposed to hypoendemic
transmission. Using this map, in the hypoendemic districts LLINs and indoor residual
spraying would be better targeted to foci of risk and in preparation for possible
epidemics as universal coverage with these interventions is unlikely to be the most
cost-effective. In those areas of receptive mesoendemic transmission, which comprise 65%
of the districts, universal coverage with LLINs should be the sustained ambition.1
56 The two divergent potential national malaria
strategies emanating from the two different descriptions of risk highlight the danger of
relying on contemporary risk maps to make decisions that require the understanding of
the intrinsic transmission potential of malaria.

Available maps that describe pre-RBM distribution of risks are either expert opinion
maps59 or climate-based deterministic
transmission suitability models60 and not driven
by empirical data. Even where empirical data may be available, in countries with
unstable malaria transmission susceptible to seasonal and anomalous climatic variations
such as the recent drought in Somalia, the risks measured at one time point may not be
representative of the possible peak risk levels for that point. Therefore, spatially
nationally representative data over several years are required to capture these
variations and estimate the highest possible transmission. In this study,
PfPR data for Somalia that is available over four consecutive years
has provided a unique opportunity to develop a novel way of selecting the maximum
predicted risks within the time series. The resolution of risk levels at the malaria
resource decision-making unit also represents a product that is likely to be of more
policy relevance to the national programme managers compared with the more common
pixel-level predictions of risks.

The study has some limitations. Although Somalia represents one of the few African
countries with ubiquitous PfPR data in space and time there are gaps in
the distribution of the data and uncertainty of the predictions are partly a function of
these. The validation tests, however, show overall good predictive model performance
with overall bias of MPE of <5% and a slight average overprediction of about MAPE
of 0.2%. The coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of SD to mean
PfPR2–10, appeared similar for both the 2010 mean
and the maximum mean maps with uncertainty highest in northern zones where data in space
and time were fewest (figure 2C,D). In selecting
the maximal mean risk as predicted to a location in any year over the 4-year period, we
make assumptions as if the modelled predictions were part of 4-year repeat
‘observations’ of PfPR2–10, in that
location. The basis for this is that if the mean estimate at any 1×1 km
location from the full posterior distribution of the space–time model is a robust
estimate to the given time and location, then selected maximum mean estimate is equally
so. We suggest that this is a plausible assumption but further efforts need to be
invested in probabilistically selecting the maximum mean predictions from the series of
usually spatially and temporally uneven data. Any uncertainties in the approach used to
select the maximum annual mean PfPR2–10 are, however,
unlikely to be the source of the major differences in endemicities when compared to the
annual mean PfPR2–10 for 2010. The
PfPR data used in this analysis were assembled during a period when
access to control interventions had increased in Somalia with donor funding support.
Although coverage of main vector control interventions remain modest,22 it is likely that some of observed data were
influenced by these interventions and in parts of the country true receptivity may even
be higher than estimated. Land-use changes due to urbanisation, large-scale agricultural
schemes and hydroelectric power dam projects also act as modifiers of transmission and
in mapping malaria risk these factors must be adjusted for. Urbanisation, which has been
shown to reduce malaria transmission, was included in the analysis of receptivity for
Somalia. The maps of water bodies and vegetation used in the analysis will to some
degree capture any aquatic or agricultural land-use changes. However, due to the long
civilwar and the lack of a functioning central government, such changes have been
limited.

To compute a single estimate of risk for a relatively large area, such as districts in
Somalia, will always obscure some of the heterogeneity in malaria distribution within
that area regardless of the methods used. Any decision to do so is therefore a
compromise between the practical applications of such a classification and the potential
loss of precision in risk estimation. Approaches that directly adopt the heterogeneous
properties of the prevalence data to make statistically robust single estimates of mean
PfPR to an administrative unit are computationally and
methodologically intensive61 but have the
advantage of estimating the area-level uncertainty classification through joint
simulation. In this study, we have used simpler approaches to partly capture the
within-district heterogeneity in malaria risk when classifying them into a single
endemicity class by first assigning pixel-level population to an endemicity class before
aggregating to the district. Future efforts should explore approaches such as joint
simulation61 and small area estimation62 techniques to describe the uncertainties around
area-level estimates of risks robustly. Such measures of uncertainties are not only
quantitative estimates of model validity but also help determine where future data
assembly must be prioritised to improve precision.

In conclusion, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the need for malaria receptivity
maps for optimal malaria resource planning in countries, which have either achieved low
stable endemic control or are of unstable transmission and therefore susceptible to
seasonality or climatic anomalies. We have used approaches that derive maps of
contemporary malaria risk and approximations of receptivity within the same
space–time MBG framework resolved at the district level in Somalia. The two maps
show significantly divergent transmission scenarios in which the contemporary map
describes the majority of Somalia as hypoendemic and while the other shows a largely
mesoendemic transmission profile. These disparities have far-reaching consequences on
decisions regarding the design and scale-up of interventions in Somalia. The results
have important control implications for several low transmission countries in Africa.
Urgent efforts must therefore be invested in assembling detailed historical data on
parasite prevalence to allow for a better understanding of receptivity and equip
national programmes with reliable estimates of receptivity that will enhance better
decision-making.

The community survey parasite prevalence data were provided by the Food and Agricultural
Organization–Food Security and Nutritional Analysis Unit (FAO-FSNAU) for Somalia.
The authors are grateful for the support and diligence of all the FSNAU field staff who
did a great job under difficult conditions. We are grateful to all household members who
participated in the survey and agreed to the malaria testing. We thank Jacob Ouko and
