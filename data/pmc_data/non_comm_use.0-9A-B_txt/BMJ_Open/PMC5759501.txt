Evidence-based teaching has the potential to promote processing in learners that leads to better transfer of skills and knowledge to the workplace and contributes to the emergence of adaptive expertise. Research shows that evidence-based teaching strategies are likely to have the largest impact on student results. In this article we have tried to adapt evidence-based teaching with SPICES model and explore some the appropriate strategies to teaching evidence-based curriculum. Also we addressed some the new method of teaching that is adjustable to these strategies in teaching and learning in evidence- based curricula.

Methods
This study covers the period of 2007â€“2013. Researches were done initially by single keywords and using OR/AND, for combining words such as: evidence-based education, teaching methods, teaching strategies, Spices strategies for identify publications from SID, IRANMEDEX, MAGIRAN, OVID, PROQUET, CINAHL, Google scholar, web of sciences and PubMed databases. A total of 309 publications were found, from which, after excluding duplication and non-related papers, only 28 publications were considered relevant to the subject and were examined thoroughly.

Results
The best strategies which are considerable in teaching evidences- based content include: Clear Lesson Goals, Show & Tell, questioning to check for understanding, summaries new learning in a graphical way, practice makes perfect, Provide Your Students with Feedback, Be Flexible About How Long It Takes to Learn, Get Students Working Together and se meta-cognition. These strategies are adjustable to SPICES pattern in designing curriculum in medical education in some part as student's center, community based education, problem based learning that can be present in new method of teaching and learning such as team based, problem based, case based learning and so on.

Conclusion
It is the responsibility of the academic institutions and policy-makers in medical education to provide condition that promotes evidence-based strategies and adjust to teaching method.
