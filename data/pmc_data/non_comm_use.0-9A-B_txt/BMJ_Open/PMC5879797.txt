To assess the feasibility of delivering and evaluating a weight management (WM)
programme for overweight patients with a family history (FH) of breast cancer (BC)
or colorectal cancer (CRC).

Study design
A two-arm (intervention vs usual care) randomised controlled trial.

Setting
National Health Service (NHS) Tayside and NHS Grampian.

Participants
People with a FH of BC or CRC aged≥18 years and body mass index of
≥25 kg/m2 referred to NHS genetic services.

Intervention
Participants were randomised to a control (lifestyle booklet) or 12-week
intervention arm where they were given one face-to-face counselling session, four
telephone consultations and web-based support. A goal of 5% reduction in body
weight was set, and a personalised diet and physical activity (PA) programme was
provided. Behavioural change techniques (motivational interviewing, action and
coping plans and implementation intentions) were used.

Primary outcome
Feasibility measures: recruitment, programme implementation, fidelity measures,
achieved measurements and retention, participant satisfaction assessed by
questionnaire and qualitative interviews.

Secondary outcomes
Measured changes in weight and PA and reported diet and psychosocial measures
between baseline and 12-week follow-up.

Results
Of 480 patients approached, 196 (41%) expressed interest in the study, and of
those, 78 (40%) patients were randomised. Implementation of the programme was
challenging within the time allotted and fidelity to the intervention modest
(62%). Qualitative findings indicated the programme was well received.
Questionnaires and anthropometric data were completed by >98%. Accelerometer data
were attained by 84% and 54% at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Retention at
12 weeks was 76%. Overall, 36% of the intervention group (vs 0% in control)
achieved 5% weight loss. Favourable increases in PA and reduction in
dietary fat were also reported.

Conclusions
A lifestyle programme for people with a family history of cancer is feasible to
conduct and acceptable to participants, and indicative results suggest favourable
outcomes.

==== Body
Strengths and limitations of this study
This feasibility study is the first attempt to offer and assess a structured,
comprehensive lifestyle programme (diet, alcohol, physical activity and body
weight) for people referred to family history clinics for colorectal and breast
cancer risk assessment.

The study design is a randomised, two-centred, lifestyle intervention study with
subjective and objective assessment measures.

Participants were all attendees at the National Health Service Family History
clinics due to a family history of breast cancer (BC) or colorectal cancer (CRC)
and are not representative of the general population.

The lifestyle intervention was not fully implemented, recruitment was lower than
anticipated and indicative findings suggest favourable effects of the intervention
on physiological measures.

The primary and secondary outcome data provide sufficient information to inform a
definitive trial.

Introduction
It is recognised that cancer arises from an interaction between genetic and
environmental factors (nature and nurture), although there may be more emphasis given to
genetics and family history in the National Health Service (NHS) rather than health
behaviour profiles. Clearly, it is desirable that people who are at greater risk of
cancer due to a family history of the disease (which may reflect shared genetic and
behavioural profiles) are supported to follow recommendations for cancer surveillance
and lifestyle. NHS genetics centres in Scotland offer early detection and counselling
for people with a family history (FH) of breast cancer (BC) and
colorectal cancer (CRC),1 but there is
little evidence of lifestyle advice.

Current estimates for the role of lifestyle in postmenopausal BC suggest that around 38%
of the disease could be prevented by increased physical activity and decreases in
alcohol intake and excess body weight.2 A number
of studies show that BC risk is lowered with intentional weight loss3 4 and recent data from bariatric surgery5 show that weight loss is correlated with
significant decreases in the incidence of cancers at several sites—notably
postmenopausal breast, colon, endometrium and pancreas. Gramling et
al6 reported from the Women’s
Health Initiative Observational study that participating in healthy lifestyles (greater
physical activity, lower alcohol intake and lower body mass index (BMI)) led to risk
reduction in postmenopausal women, and the degree of this benefit was the same for women
with and without an FH of BC. A recent review by Pettapiece-Phillips et
al7 reports evidence of a protective
role of a healthy body size and regular activity among mutation carriers notably in
adolescence and early adulthood.

It is estimated that around 45% of CRC could be prevented by diet and other lifestyle
behaviours (dietary fibre intake and physical activity and low intakes of red and
processed meat, alcohol and body fatness).2 For
CRC, people with an FH may be more susceptible to lifestyle-related risk. For example,
in a pooled analysis, Cho et al8
reported that the relative risks of CRC with alcohol consumption
of ≥30 g/d were 1.23 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.57;
Not Significant) among those with no FH and 2.02 (95% CI
1.30 to 3.13) among those with an FH of CRC. The importance of excess
weight and increased risk of developing CRC has been highlighted by Movahedi et
al,9 who reported that in patients
with Lynch syndrome, CRC risk was increased by 7% for each 1 kg/m2
increase in BMI. A recent review of alcohol, obesity and other nutritional factors in
people with familial CRC by Fardet et al10 present a clear case for why modifiable risk factors could offer
new perspectives on prevention.

Akhtar et al11 reported, in a UK
survey of relatives of patients diagnosed with CRC, that most (88%) said they were
prepared to make lifestyle changes if given enough information. In the BeWEL12 study (lifestyle intervention for people at
higher CRC risk due to an adenoma), around half (49%) of 997 patients showed an interest
in finding out more about the lifestyle (weight loss) trial.

It is also noteworthy that, for patients subsequently diagnosed with BC or CRC, obesity
is associated with poorer prognosis, increases in disease recurrence and overall
mortality.13 14

Identifying increased risk of developing a disease is unlikely to be sufficient to
change behaviour,15 and knowledge of FH per se is
unlikely to be sufficient to initiate sustained weight management behaviours. In a
questionnaire study of 237 (49%) people attending family history clinics in the East of
Scotland, Anderson et al16
reported that while smoking rates were modest (11%), most respondents had a
BMI ≥25 kg/m2, low levels of physical activity and
high alcohol consumption. Interview data in a subgroup of these respondents highlighted
doubts about the link between lifestyle and cancer, and few were familiar with the
current evidence. While lifestyle advice was considered interesting in general, there
was little appetite for non-tailored guidance.

Marteau and Lerman17 argues that motivation to
change behaviour may be achieved by increasing beliefs that changing behaviour can
reduce risks by increasing beliefs in the individual’s ability to change.
However, it is more likely that self-efficacy and self-regulatory techniques (eg, goal
setting) play a greater role in achieving effective behaviour change.18 19 National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence guidelines on familial BC recommend that standard written information for
people with concerns about familial BC risk should include ‘lifestyle, including
diet, alcohol etc’,20 but the reasons for
this choice of communication is unclear. Genetic counsellors (GCs) receive little
if any training in promoting healthy lifestyles, and there is little evidence that
advice is routinely provided.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of delivering a 12-week
lifestyle intervention programme (LivingWELL) for people with an FH of BC and CRC
initiated within the FH setting in order to inform the design of a definitive randomised
controlled trial (RCT) to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this
intervention.

Specific objectives were to estimate recruitment rate for a full RCT, assess the
feasibility of data collection procedures and protocol adherence, explore participant
experience and establish a power calculation required for a full-scale study

Methods
Study design and setting
This study was a two-arm, two-centre, parallel, randomised-controlled, feasibility
study integrated with qualitative interviews conducted with people referred to NHS
genetic services in Tayside and Grampian from August 2015 to March 2016. This study
is reported in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010
statement: extension to randomised pilot and feasibility trials.21

Sample size
We aimed to recruit 120 (60 intervention and 60 control) participants in order to be
able to assess feasibility objectives allowing for a loss to follow-up of 10% with
precision of ±1% at 95% CI.22

Recruitment and randomisation
New attendees at genetics clinic were informed about the study by the GCs and given a
brief information sheet, clinician endorsement letter, non-participation
questionnaire and reply slip with stamped addressed envelope. They were also
offered the opportunity to discuss the study with the research team. Where low-risk
patients did not attend the clinics in person, postal versions of the study materials
were sent. Low initial recruitment after 3 months resulted in a protocol amendment to
allow study information to be passed to established patients returning for
mammographic or endoscopic procedures in one centre (not considered feasible in the
other centre).

GCs/clinical staff recorded the numbers of patients attending clinics and informed
patients with an FH of BC or CRC about the study. Staff noted when they felt it
inappropriate to provide information about the study and recorded any reasons that
patients gave for non-participation. Interested patients were given a brief
information sheet and an endorsement letter from the relevant lead clinician. They
were asked to provide their contact details. An opt-out slip and non-participant
feedback form were included for those who decided not to participate.

Research nurses made contact with interested patients to assess eligibility and
provide a full information sheet. All those written to (or given packs) could also
respond by telephone/postal reply slip. Eligible participants were adults,
age ≥18 years, with an FH of BC or CRC and measured
BMI ≥25 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were severe
cognitive impairment, or conditions where physical activity was contraindicated,
pregnancy, breast feeding or currently undergoing active treatment for
cancer.

Once continued interest and eligibility were established, an appointment was made for
a baseline measurement visit where informed consent was obtained. Postbaseline visit,
participants were allocated (by the study administrator who informed the participant
and lifestyle coach (LC) of the outcome) into usual care (control) or
intervention groups 1:1 using a computer-generated random allocation list. The
research nurse was blinded to the randomisation.

Intervention
The 12-week intervention, ‘LivingWELL’, aimed to help participants
increase physical activity, modify diet, achieve weight loss towards 5% of body
weight and avoid weight gain. Personalised advice was given on a 600 kcal
deficit dietary intake as recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines
Network (SIGN)23 and a graduated approach
aimed at increasing activity to 225–300 min per week by 12 weeks. The
theoretical basis for the intervention draws on Leventhal’s Self-Regulatory
Theory24 (which highlights the importance
of the individual’s beliefs regarding illness cause, identity, control/cure,
timeline and consequences), Social Cognitive Theory,25 which emphasises the importance of self-efficacy, and the Health Action
Process Approach,26 which emphasises the
importance of action and coping planning.

The ‘LivingWELL’ programme was delivered by LCs personnel (with a
nursing background) who received bespoke training on the delivery of the intervention
programme. Intervention participants received one face-to-face session plus (up to)
four telephone consultations over the 12-week programme, a ‘LivingWELL’
information pack, pedometer and walking programme. Participants were also offered a
web-based support programme. The face-to-face session was designed to be interactive
and included a 10 min ‘walk and talk’ session during which
pedometer use and walking goals were discussed, self-identification of BMI category
and a portion weight estimate task.

Participants received a personalised energy deficit diet, a personalised graduated
walking plan and guidance on setting personal goals, how to make changes habitual and
relapse prevention strategies for times of deviation.

Motivational interviewing techniques were used to explore self-assessed confidence to
change and self-perceived benefits. Behavioural change techniques (goal setting,
action and coping plans and implementation intentions) were also used. The importance
of self-monitoring pedometer data, diet and drink logs and weekly body weight was
emphasised. These data formed the basis for the 15 min phone consultations,
which checked well-being, self-monitoring behaviours, actions and coping plans.
Details of the intervention are described in figures
1 and 2.

Primary outcome measure
Data were collected on numbers of people told about the study, those expressing an
interest, numbers meeting eligibility criterion, rates of recruitment, achieved
measurements and retention. Reasons for non-participation and withdrawal were
collected where possible.

Intervention contact time was recorded by LCs, and the ease of implementing the
counselling sessions and perceived engagement and motivation of participants was
recorded using a 5-point Likert scale (scored −2 to +2). A random
sample of face-to-face visits and telephone calls were recorded and independently
analysed to assess fidelity to the detailed intervention protocol.

All participants who completed the study were asked to fill out an anonymous patient
satisfaction questionnaire (to rate programme visits, measurements and intervention)
that was distributed after the follow-up visit. Qualitative interviews (n=20)
explored intervention participants’ views on study acceptability (recruitment,
assessment and intervention programme) and factors influencing adherence.
Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic framework
approach.

Secondary outcome measures
Follow-up procedures took place after the 12-week intervention period. Both baseline
and follow-up measures were undertaken by research nurses blinded to the group
allocation, and participants were asked not to share their group allocation with the
researchers.

Research nurses recorded sociodemographic information and measured height at the
baseline visit. At both baseline and follow-up, physiological measures (body weight,
waist circumference and blood pressure) were taken, and BMI was assessed.

Physical activity was subjectively assessed using the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire Short Form27 (for
low/medium and high activity grading and to get insight into activity modes)
and objectively measured by Sensewear (BodyMedia, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA)
physical activity monitors, which provided detailed analysis of sedentary time,
moderate and vigorous activity and step counts. Eating habits were assessed by the
Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education questionnaire28 and alcohol intake by a 7-day alcohol record.29 Smoking was assessed by questions on current
and historic tobacco use.

Psychosocial variables measured included beliefs about cancer cause and risk
reduction (modified brief illness perception questionnaire30) and quality of life using the Euro-Qol-5D questionnaire.31 These measures were undertaken primarily to
assess participant burden for planning a full-scale trial.

Statistical analysis
For all quantitative outcome measures, the main aim of this study was principally to
assess feasibility of intervention delivery to inform the design of a main trial,
thus the indicative outcomes are underpowered for statistical interpretation.

Quantitative data analysis was undertaken using STATA V.14. Descriptive statistics
were used to characterise the cohort. Within group changes between baseline and
follow-up outcomes were estimated for intervention and control groups using a paired
t-test. Between group differences in the outcome change from baseline and follow-up
adjusted for baseline values were estimated using linear regression methods. Both
within and between group differences are presented as means and 95% CIs.

Results
Primary outcomes (feasibility)
Patients informed about the study
In total, 600 patients were identified as potentially eligible for the study (364
BC and 236 CRC FH) over the 8-month recruitment period (figure 3). Of those, 312
(52%) were new patients and 288 (48%) review patients (4 month period
only). Records kept by clinical and study staff show a total of 480 patients (282
BC and 198 CRC FH) were given study information (169 in person and 311 by
invitation letters). Within the clinics, 120 people were not approached where GCs
considered it inappropriate (35), the person was thought to be ineligible (46),
there was not enough time (9), patients were in another study (2), staff noted
they lived far from the hospital (7) or for reasons unknown (21).

Patients interested in the study
A total of 196 (41%) people (132 BC and 64 CRC FH) agreed to be contacted.
Greatest interest in the study was expressed by new and review patients advised
about the study in face-to-face clinic visits (70% and 93%, respectively, agreed
to be contacted) compared with new and review patient advised by letter (7% and
27%, respectively). It is notable that despite the high interest expressed by
review patients in face-to-face visits (93%), the numbers randomised dropped to
32%. No new patients contacted by letter went on to be randomised.

Eligibility and recruitment rate
Of the 196 who agreed to be contacted, 32 (16%) declined to take part, 40 (20%)
did not respond to telephone approaches and 46 (23%) were ineligible (due to BMI).
A total of 78 people (40% of those who agreed to be contacted; 39% of BC and 42%
of CRC FH approached; 16% of those who were potentially eligible for the study)
were randomised.

Baseline characteristics
The mean age was 27.1+12.8 years (range 18–72) and 88% were female (table 1). Most were in employment, had
postschool professional or academic qualifications and belonged to the two least
deprived quintiles of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD).

Achieved measurements
Evaluation measures were 99%–100% complete for all participants who
attended baseline and follow-up appointments. Accelerometer data (for at least 4
days) was obtained for 67 (84%) participants at baseline and 42 (54%) at
follow-up.

Retention
Of the 78 randomised, 59 (75%) completed the study (74% control and 77%
intervention). Completion rates were similar by BC (72%) and CRC (81%) (figure 3). A greater proportion of people from
SIMD quintiles 1 and 2 (high deprivation) were likely to withdraw compared with
SIMD quintiles 3, 4 and 5 (38% vs 22%).

Trials.

Non-participation
It is estimated that approximately 100 non-participation feedback forms were
distributed at clinic appointments, and over 300 were posted with study
information packs. A total of 28 questionnaires were returned. Most responders
were women (86%), and the average age was 51.2 years (range 25–72). Of
those, 21 people reported a weight and height: 9 had a normal BMI and 12 were
overweight or obese. The majority of respondents were from areas of low
deprivation (59%). The most common reasons for not taking part were that
‘their lifestyle was already good’ (29%) and ‘too little time
to participate’ (14%).

Intervention contact and delivery
In the intervention group, 37 of the 39 randomised (two withdrew) received a
face-to-face session with a LC. The mean time for the face-to-face visit was
81 min (range 70–130) compared with an estimated 65 min. The
mean time for telephone calls at all time points was 15 min (range
5–30), the same as the estimated allowance.

The LCs estimated around 73% of the total programme was covered, while fidelity
scores for nine face-to-face sessions and that 16 telephone calls rated that 62%
of the intervention components were delivered as per protocol. LCs assessed
perceived patient engagement, receptivity and motivation highly: 89%, 92%, and 89%
respectively, in Likert-scaled questions.

Access to the ‘LivingWELL’ study website was given to all
intervention participants and 10 (33%) logged on.

Participant feedback
Acceptability data were obtained from 47 (80%) anonymised patient satisfaction
questionnaires (23 control and 24 intervention) and from the 20 participant
interviews. Results from the questionnaire showed that most (89%) participants
reported that they found study participation quite/very easy and 38
(81%) reported that they would recommend ‘LivingWELL’ to
others. Most (80%) of the intervention group expressed a high degree of
satisfaction with intervention components. The following suggestions for change
were made: feedback of results, further contacts with coaches and longer term
follow-up.

The qualitative interview data revealed that intervention staff were perceived by
participants as professional, knowledgeable, helpful and approachable.
Appointments at the centre with LCs were largely perceived as convenient in terms
of duration, scheduling and travel incurred. The various measurements were not
considered invasive or inappropriate. However, a few participants found the
activity monitors heavy and uncomfortable. Overall, most participants were
satisfied with the study and recommended few improvements. Participants reported
the following barriers to change:everyday routines

sedentary occupations

family commitments

poor physical or mental health

stressful events such as exams, bereavement or family illness

long-standing complex relationships with food.



In general, participants appeared to find it easier to change physical activity
than diet.

Secondary outcomes
The aim of this study was to determine feasibility, not to evaluate statistically
significant change. However, changes in physiological measures suggest a favourable
effect of the intervention on the primary outcome of body weight loss and diastolic
blood pressure (table 2). These findings are
reflected in the proportions achieving 5% weight loss (37% in the intervention
group compared with 0% in control group) and 10% weight loss (10% of the
intervention group).

Using the data from the current study, where we observed a mean body weight of
89.5 kg (±SD 13.3), a total of 187 participants per group would be
needed to detect a between group difference of 5% weightt change
(4.47 kg) at follow-up, at 90% power and 5% alpha based on a two-tailed
unpaired t-test. Allowing for an assumed 25% drop-out this would mean recruiting 250
participants per group.

Based on the current figures: to recruit 500 people, 1250 would need to express an
interest (40% of those who expressed an interest were recruited). For 1250 to express
an interest, 3048 would require to be approached (based on 41% of people approached
were interested). If all clinics recruited similar numbers to the two in the current
study (240 in an 8-month period/360 per year), then nine centres would be needed for
a 12-month recruitment period.

Discussion
Main findings
Despite evidence for the importance of lifestyle in the aetiology of BC and
CRC, counselling on diet, physical activity and weight management is not routinely
provided for people with a family history of these conditions referred to NHS
genetics clinics. While cancer preventability estimates suggest that healthful ways
of life could significantly reduce cancer risk, the impact of lifestyle interventions
in this patient group is unknown and randomised controlled trial data is needed to
examine the cost, benefits and harms. The results from this pilot study show that it
is feasible to recruit, randomise and retain patients and to implement and evaluate a
weight management programme combining diet and physical activity advice with
behavioural change techniques that is acceptable to patients. The results also
indicate that implementation of this programme is associated with favourable
outcomes. However, the current work has highlighted the importance of face-to-face
approaches for study recruitment and the cautious approach taken by genetic clinic
staff to introducing the study. The findings have also enabled the collection of data
that allows a power calculation to be performed for the design of a definitive
randomised controlled trial.

Strengths and weaknesses
The main strength of the study is that (to the best of our knowledge) the current
work is the first attempt to offer a comprehensive lifestyle programme (diet,
alcohol, physical activity and body weight) for people referred to FH clinics for CRC
and BC risk assessment. The main weakness of the study is the sociodemographic
profile of participants recruited who were predominantly Caucasian and >50%
were from the two lowest deprivation quintiles (eg, higher socioeconomic status).
Although this distribution reflects the general demographic for high-risk attendees
for breast mammography clinics in this region32 (where there is little ethnic diversity), it highlights the
difficulties in offering both surveillance and lifestyle interventions to affected
people from more deprived areas.

The sample size was less than planned due to fewer patients being referred to the
service than previous years (on which our estimate was based), fewer informed about
the study than estimated (despite input from clinic staff in study design) and fewer
being seen face to face than anticipated. The current results underline the need for
feasibility work. Overall, study retention was high but further efforts to reduce
loss to follow-up in people living in areas of higher deprivation should be explored.
Attempts to increase recruitment from existing patients demonstrate that both new and
returning patients have some interest in the topic, but in general a greater
awareness of the relevance of lifestyle in cancer prevention would be beneficial to
recruitment. Other weaknesses include the time allocation for the face-to-face
meeting, which was insufficient for the intended content, resulting in the LCs
deviating from the original protocol. In addition, retention was only assessed over a
12-week period, and a longer test period is likely to be associated with higher loss
to follow-up. Independent assessment of fidelity also suggests scope for improvement
in time allocation as only 62% of intervention components were delivered per
protocol.

Other studies
No fully powered trials of lifestyle interventions in people with family history of
cancer have yet reported and those that have been described in the literature focus
primarily on physical activity33 34 in
Breast Cancer, early onset (BRCA) mutation carriers. Ongoing trials of weight
management to decrease BC risk are being undertaken in women already diagnosed
with the disease35–38 but
are not exclusive to people at increased genetic risk. Pilot and formative work on
weight loss and reducing markers of BC has been undertaken39 (notably on the intermittent energy diet
approach) in women with family history of BC, demonstrating significant changes in
insulin sensitivity and body fat reduction, but no work has been reported for
patients with a family history of CRC. Postintervention interviews with
participants40 have highlighted the
importance of providing a credible rationale for weight control and weight loss that
underlines the need for health professionals working in this area to introduce and
endorse the importance of lifestyle to aid recruitment.

Implications for clinicians and policymakers
This pilot study has highlighted a number of perceived challenges for NHS staff
discussing lifestyle issues among patients with a family history of BC and
CRC but has also demonstrated that there is an interest in being able to offer
more help that could usefully be developed. Indicative results suggest the
intervention had a favourable effect on body weight, physical activity and fat intake
score with potential for clinically relevant benefits for both cancer risk reduction
and long-term health (with or without a cancer diagnosis). While the qualitative data
highlight the complexity and challenge of changing health behaviours, the measured
changes in physical activity and weight loss suggest that small but significant
changes can be achieved, at least in the short term. Support for habitual and
sustained lifestyle change is essential as part of long-term intervention design.

Unanswered questions and future research
The generalisability of the current findings are unclear. However, work to date
suggests that the intervention is feasible to deliver and evaluate and could be
tested in a large RCT, subject to modifications. In a fully powered trial, the first
stage would be to assess the magnitude of lifestyle change that can be achieved by
this type of programme. In turn, this fully powered trial would act as a
‘pilot’ for a full trial of reduction in CRC markers. Adenomas
(number and size) might be an appropriate end point depending on funding for the
length of follow-up.

It would be desirable to increase patient recruitment, and the current findings
suggest that overall uptake could be increased with better training, support and
endorsement from the GCs and other clinical staff. This area of study was almost
entirely new and met with scepticism from staff and indeed patients. Our earlier work
suggests ambiguous attitudes about the importance of lifestyle with little evidence
that these topics have been previously discussed with clinicians.18

The programme was received enthusiastically by participants, but further work is
needed to refine intervention components, particularly dietary aspects that were less
appreciated than the physical activity aspects and may need tailoring for ethnic
groups. Measurements were successfully attained and appropriate for a full study
protocol, although a review of accelerometry approaches is warranted. The numbers
required for a full trial with weight change as a primary outcome would require a
multicentre approach with a minimum recruitment period of at least 12 months.
Overall, the main uncertainties required for planning a definitive randomised
controlled trial have been addressed.
