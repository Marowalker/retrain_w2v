The ability to communicate is a basic skill for human beings and some people in this area are more capable than the others. That's why communication skills training is one of the medical education issues that have been emphasized in recent years. These skills are taught, measured and evaluated with different methods. This study aimed to investigate the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences newly-arrived residents' satisfaction of patient-physician communication workshops conducted in 1394.

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 150 newly-arrived residents in all clinical training subjects. Data was collected using researcher-made questionnaire for satisfaction of environment and training facilities, teachers teaching and presentations and course content. The validity and reliability of questionnaires were assessed in good level, through conducting a pilot study. The data was analyzed using SPSS.

Results
The results showed that all newly-arrived residents' satisfaction of patient-physician communication workshops is above the cutoff point (m=4.26±.49). Of the variables studied the greatest satisfaction were teaching methods (4.52±0.26), presentations (m=4.32±.36) and environment and training facilities (m=4.22±0.23). The survey of satisfaction showed no significant statistical difference between the assistants by different fields (p=0.1).

Conclusion
The residents' satisfaction of patient-physician communication workshops is highly desirable which is the reason for this workshop to be hold annually.
