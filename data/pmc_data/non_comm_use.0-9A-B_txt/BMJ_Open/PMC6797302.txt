Liver resection is the only curative treatment for primary and secondary hepatic tumours. Improvements in perioperative preparation of patients and new surgical developments have made complex liver resections possible. However, small for size and flow syndrome (SFSF) is still a challenging issue, rendering patients inoperable and causing postoperative morbidity and mortality. Although the role of transhepatic flow in the postoperative outcome has been shown in small partial liver transplantation and experimental studies of SFSF, this has never been studied in the clinical setting following liver resection. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate transhepatic flow changes following major liver resection and its correlation with postoperative outcomes.

Methods and analysis
The TransHEpatic FLOW (THEFLOW) study is a single-centre, non-interventional cohort study, and aims to enrol 50 patients undergoing major hepatectomy (defined as hemihepatectomy or extended hepatectomy based on the Brisbane classification) with or without prior chemotherapy. The portal venous flow, hepatic artery flow and portal venous pressure are measured before and after each resection. All patients are followed-up for 3 months after the operation. During each evaluation, standard clinical data, posthepatectomy liver failure and overall morbidity and mortality will be recorded. THEFLOW study was initiated on 25 March 2018 and is expected to progress for 2 years.

Ethics and dissemination
This protocol study received approval from the Ethics Committee of the University of Heidelberg (registration number: S576/2017). The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and will also be presented at medical meetings.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The THEFLOW study is a single-centre, non-interventional cohort study.

The THEFLOW study will be the first prospective clinical study to systematically evaluate the association between transhepatic flow changes and posthepatectomy results.

Transhepatic haemodynamic changes following liver resection will be assessed in livers with and without prior chemotherapy.

A limitation of this study is that a postoperative monitoring of the portal vein pressure is not possible.

Findings of this study may help to improve the postoperative outcomes of patients with a high risk of small for size and flow syndrome.

Introduction
Liver resection is the only curative treatment for many primary and secondary hepatic tumours.1–3 Improvements in patient selection criteria, surgical methods and postoperative care have made major liver resections (hemihepatectomy or extended hepatectomy) more feasible and safer.4–8 However, posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) or the risk of developing PHLF because of small remnant liver (as small for size syndrome) still needs novel predictive factors9 10 and remains challenging because they can render the patient inoperable or cause postoperative mortality and morbidity.11 12 The current preventive and therapeutic efforts, which focus only on the remnant liver volume (eg, two-staged hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation, or associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS)), have improved the results, but they are still not effective enough.13–16 Therefore, there are still many patients, who either are not operated because of the high risk of PHLF or suffer from PHLF following major hepatectomy.

Findings from partial liver transplantation have revealed the role of transhepatic flow parallel to the size of the remnant liver17 18; therefore, the syndrome was discussed to be called as small for size and flow syndrome (SFSF).19–21 In an experimental setting, the portal vein flow (PVF) and the portal vein pressure (PVP) increase significantly for the remnant liver volume following major liver resection.22 This increase has important pathophysiological consequences, causing cellular necrosis and SFSF.8 23–25 Troisi et al suggested an upper limit of 250 mL/min/100 g PVF to prevent SFSF after living donor liver transplantation.19 26 Although transhepatic flow plays a role in partial liver transplantation27 and in experimental liver resection,22 this has never been shown systematically following liver resection in the clinical setting.

The primary aim of this study is to systematically evaluate the amount of changes in transhepatic flow following major liver resection. Furthermore, association of transhepatic flow with postoperative outcomes such as SFSF will be investigated.

Methods and analysis
Study settings
The THEFLOW study is a single-centre, non-interventional cohort study. The study aims to enrol 50 patients undergoing major liver resection (ie, a hemihepatectomy or an extended hemihepatectomy) with or without prior chemotherapy. This study is taking place at the division of liver surgery in the Department of General, Visceral, and Transplantation Surgery of the University of Heidelberg. Our centre is a referral hepatopancreatobiliary centre that is highly specialised in the treatment of patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancer. It was initiated on 25 March 2018 and is expected to progress for 2 years.

Patient recruitment
As shown in the study flow chart (figure 1), all patients who undergo major hepatectomy (defined as hemihepatectomy or extended hepatectomy according to the Brisbane nomenclature)28 are currently being screened for eligibility. Eligible patients that provide informed consent will be treated and followed up according to routine procedures at the Department of General, Visceral, and Transplantation Surgery in Heidelberg University Hospital. Transhepatic flow and pressure parameters, that is, portal venous flow, hepatic artery flow (HAF) and PVP, will be measured in study participants before and after resection; meanwhile, the standard surgical procedure is not altered. We will look for anatomical variations, stenosis of the celiac trunk or superior mesentery artery, as these factors affect the physiological flow of the liver artery and portal vein. Eligibility will be determined based on informed consent status, age, planned surgery and comorbidities (table 1). Furthermore, total liver volume will be calculated based on preoperative imaging. It is important to note that central tumours may compress the vessels, precluding measurement of physiological flow or pressure. Patients with such tumours will be excluded from the study.

To calculate the variation of the transhepatic flow to the remnant liver volume, we will measure the removed liver volume during surgery and use CT volumetric assessment to quantify the liver volume before and 3 months after surgery. Additionally, liver stiffness will be evaluated using fibroscan before surgery, at discharge and 3 months after surgery. Laboratory results (table 4), length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, PHLF and all-cause mortality will also be reported until POD 90 (tables 2 and 3).

Patient and public involvement
The patients and public were not involved in the planning of this study.

Modification of the protocol
Protocol amendments will be considered by the principal investigator. All protocol amendments will be submitted to the Ethics Committee for approval. No patients will be recruited until the modifications are accepted.

Methods for minimising bias
To avoid selection bias and to ensure homogeneity of patients, all patients admitted to Heidelberg University Hospital that are scheduled to undergo major liver resection will be screened for eligibility. Every patient who meets the inclusion criteria and does not meet the exclusion criteria will be informed of the study and included if he/she gives consent to participate (table 1). Data will be analysed after all data have been collected. Furthermore, selective reporting will be avoided by submitting the study protocol prior to data collection including all information concerning study endpoints and statistical analysis. Any financial relationship and any conflict of interest that may arise will also be declared.

Ethical and legal aspects and termination criteria
Patients will be informed verbally and in writing about the nature and scope of the planned study and participation in the study will be voluntary. The names of the patients and all other confidential information will be subject to medical confidentiality and the provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act. In accordance with the European General Data Protection Regulations, all patient data will be collected anonymously. For statistical analysis, patient data will only be transferred in anonymised form. Third parties will not have access to original patient records.

Consent to participate may be withdrawn at any time, without giving reasons and without affecting further medical care. On withdrawal from the study, the patient’s data will be irreversibly deleted unless they agree to materials and data already collected being used anonymously in evaluation.

Data management
All data will be collected and recorded in case report forms (CRFs) by an investigator before transfer to the data management centre. To ensure accurate data collection, the CRF will be completed by an investigator who did not evaluate the patient after each patient visit. All demographic and baseline clinical data, as well as primary and secondary outcome measures, will be recorded in the CRF. All data will be checked, and any missing data will be obtained from the trial database or from participants. To ensure patient confidentiality, the CRF for each patient will be given an anonymous allocation number. We will ask for permission to continue follow-up and data collection in the event of withdrawal from the study. The principal investigator will review and sign all completed CRFs.

Statistical design and analysis
Sample size
This is an explorative study; therefore, a formal sample size was not calculated. Transhepatic flow changes will be measured in 50 patients, which is considered sufficient.

Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be used to compare paired variables (ie, PVF, PVP, HAF, CVP, MAP and heart rate) before and after liver resection. Continuous variables will be compared between two groups using Mann-Whitney U test. The association of categorical variables will be evaluated by Fisher’s exact test. To assess the predictive role of transhepatic flow changes, multivariate logistic regression analyses with forward stepwise selection will be performed. Variables with p<0.1 from the univariate analysis will be included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significance level will be set at α≤0.05, representing 95% CI.

Discussion
Despite numerous new surgical achievements, SFSF remains a challenging risk for patients who have to undergo major liver resection.19 Patients with marginal remnant liver volume are particularly at risk and as a result, these patients are often considered inoperable or develop postoperative SFSF. To overcome this problem and prevent PHLF, efforts have been made to give the remnant liver time to regenerate after resection, such as in two-staged hepatectomy, portal vein embolisation and ALPPS.29 30 However, despite promising primary results, complications remain high and dropouts due to inadequate liver regeneration are often, meaning many patients cannot be operated on further.30 During the last years, findings from partial liver transplantation31 have highlighted the important role of transhepatic flow in major liver resection.19 This important role was confirmed by experimental studies.22 In our previous experimental study, major liver resection increased the PVF and PVP for the remnant liver volume.22 This was particularly significant after extended liver resection. The high PVF and PVP put too much pressure on the parenchyma, causing sinus endothelial damage through high shear stress. This leads to haemorrhage, cellular damage and production of reactive oxygen species,32 meaning the remnant liver volume fails to function properly.

Although there are many clinical transplantation studies and experimental studies, to the best of our knowledge, there is still no clinical study evaluating transhepatic flow changes and their association with PHLF following major liver resection. Moreover, transhepatic flow and pressure variation have not been compared between the normal liver and a liver after chemotherapy. The THEFLOW study will be the first study to systematically evaluate transhepatic haemodynamic changes in normal and postchemotherapy livers following major hepatectomy. Furthermore, the correlation of the transhepatic flow changes with postoperative outcomes will be evaluated. Findings of the THEFLOW study will define cut-off values for the PVF and PVP that can predict the risk of SFSF in patients undergoing major hepatectomy. Patients with marginal remnant liver volume and/or a haemodynamic risk of SFSF may benefit from a different surgical strategy, for example, adjustment from a one-step to a two-step concept.

In summary, the association between transhepatic flow changes and SFSF after major hepatectomy has not been well investigated. The THEFLOW study will be the first prospective clinical study to systematically evaluate the role of transhepatic flow changes in prediction of SFSF after major hepatectomy. The comprehensive findings of this study may show that the postoperative outcomes of patients with a high risk of SFSF can be improved by adjusting the surgical strategy and by providing more intensive perioperative care.
