Vaucher P, Bischoff T, Diserens EA, et al. Detecting and measuring
deprivation in primary care: development, reliability and validity of a self-reported
questionnaire: the DiPCare-Q. 
BMJ Open 2012;2:e000692. Figure 2 reports the DiPCare-Q index combining weights
from each of the three sub-indexes. The function below the figure corresponds to the
regression function associating subjective social status to the DiPCare-Q sub-indexes from
the derivation set. The entered numbers in the table do not fit to the function. The
numbers written in the table itself are issued from a first version that had not
transformed sub-indexes before computing the final index. They are therefore erroneous.
Please refer to the corrected figure below.
