In intensive care unit, patients' conditions are more complex and more likely to be at risk of complications and death; therefore, implementing of interventions based on the best evidence is the key issue for nurses. Bridging the gap between scientific evidence and patient care is necessary to accurately identify barriers so; the aim of this study was to determine the barriers to implementing evidence-based care from nurse's view-point in intensive care, social security hospitals in Tabriz.

Methods
This is a descriptive- analytical research in which 60 nurses working in intensive care units (ICU, CCU, Dialysis) of social security hospitals in Tabriz participated using census sampling and barriers to implementing EBP were examined using a Funk's EBP Barriers scale which is divided into four subscales: subscales erelated to Nurses, hospital or organization, the quality of research and subscale on how to submit the findings of research. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistical tests (chi-square and Fisher). The significance level of 0.05 was considered in the statistical analysis.

Results
The average age of the samples was 36.34. Mostly women (71.2%), mostly undergraduate education (89.8%) and mostly with formal employment status (94.9%) were. Subscale of the Nurses had no significant relationship with any of the variables. Subscale related to organization, with age, education amount and employment status, subscale related to the quality of research with education amount and subscale on how to submit the findings of research with age, gender, work experience and employment status had significant relationship. Overall, education amount and employment status had significant relationship with barriers to implementing evidence-based practice, in this way the nurses had formal employment status and higher education, did more evidence-based care.

Conclusion
It is necessary hospitals provide conditions that research and using the results to be given priority. Only nursing education and giving them more authority couldn't be sufficient to implement research findings in clinical practice so, organizational climates of hospitals need to change and reform.
