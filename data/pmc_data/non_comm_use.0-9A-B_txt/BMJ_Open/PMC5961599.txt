Ashdown HF, Fleming S, Spencer EA, et al. Diagnostic accuracy study of three alcohol breathalysers marketed for sale to the public. BMJ Open 2014;4:e005811. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005811

There is an error in the following sentence:

“One alcohol breathalyser had sensitivity of 26%, corresponding to false reassurance for approximately one person in four who is over the limit by the reference standard, at least on the evening of drinking alcohol”.

The part ‘one person in four who is’ should read ‘three people in four who are’.
