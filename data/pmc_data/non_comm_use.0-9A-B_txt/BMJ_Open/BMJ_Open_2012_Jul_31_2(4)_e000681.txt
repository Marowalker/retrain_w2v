The authors investigated self-perceived psychosomatic health in young people
(10–24 years of age) in Sweden and analysed different samples during
the years 2005 and 2007–2010 via a community website.

Design
Repeated cross-sectional surveys: (1) single question on a single day in 2005. (2)
One specific question delivered on each of eight separate days in 2005. (3) The
same eight questions delivered to smaller groups on the same day in 2007 and then
again to randomly selected subjects in 2010.

Setting
Validated questionnaires launched on the internet by a recognised Swedish
community site. Study participants were invited to answer questions about their
health with full anonymity as they logged into their personal area.

Participants
10–24-year-old children, adolescents and young adults.

Primary and secondary outcome measures
Self-reported psychosomatic health in terms of sex and age over time.

Results
A large number of responses were obtained (up to 140 000). The response
rate for the single item on stress was 41%. A high percentage of young subjects
responded that they felt stressed very often/often; the numbers were higher for
women (47%) than for men (29%). Older teenaged women had more psychosomatic
complaints than did men of similar ages; in contrast, among 10–12-year-old
children, the percentage of psychosomatic complaints was similar for men and
women. When comparing results obtained in 2010 with those obtained in 2007, young
people of both sexes had a slightly better self-perceived health status in
2007.

Conclusions
During the period 2005–2010 a high percentage of young people, particularly
females, 16–18 years of age, had psychosomatic complaints and
considered themselves as being often or very often stressed. These complaints were
more pronounced in the older age groups. When directing questions to a large
community, internet-based surveys appear to be valuable tools.

Article summary
Article focus
Examining self-perceived health and stress in large cohorts of children,
adolescents and young adults who are members of a large Swedish web-based
community.

Examining whether psychosomatic health deteriorated in adolescents between 2007
and 2010.

Assessment of the usability of a large web-based community on the internet to
investigate self-perceived psychosomatic health in Swedish youth.

Key messages
A high percentage of young subjects responded that they felt stressed very
often/often, and the numbers were higher for women than for men.

Older teenaged women had more psychosomatic complaints than men did.

Both sexes reported a slightly worse self-perceived health status in 2010 than
in 2007.

Novel internet-based community site surveys are feasible for assessing
self-perceived health in the young.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The study examined a very large cohort of children, adolescents and young
adults from throughout Sweden.

All subjects responded completely voluntarily.

There may be a selection bias, given that we do not know the psychosomatic
health of individuals who were not logged onto the website.

Participation in the survey was completely anonymous; thus, we could not
perform additional interviews to study the web questions' validity in
this population.
==== Body
Introduction
Children's life situations have changed dramatically over the past decades.
Several conditions in today's modern information-based society have exposed
children to seemingly increased levels of stress in multiple ways.1
2 Lupien et al
3 noted that risk factors for the development of
stress reactions depend primarily on an individual's genetic vulnerability,
exposure to adverse life events, socioeconomic situation, disturbances in important
relationships, problems with school and the timing of stressful events. Importantly, the
development of stress reactions in young people is, to a great extent, gender
dependent.4–6 Thus, it seems
plausible that several factors, both psychological and physical, play important roles in
the development of stress reactions which will have an impact on children's
well-being and ill health, with salient implications for future health and disease.7


High frequencies of ill health, such as complaints about perceived stress and
psychosomatic symptoms in children, adolescents and young adults, particularly older
teenage girls, have recently been reported in Sweden and internationally.8–13 The aim of this study
was to obtain information both at a given time point and as a analysis at different time
points about perceived stress and psychosomatic symptoms in Swedish subjects aged
10–24 years. To achieve this purpose, we needed a strategy that would
feasibly allow us to ascertain a large number of respondents. Donker et
al
14 used screening questionnaires for common
mental disorders and recommended that such questionnaires be administered via the
internet, which offers quick and easy access to a large number of users at a low cost.
The screening must be brief, as subjects are more likely to undergo screening if it is
short, quickly completed and easy to read.14


Our primary and main aim was to explore psychosomatic health problems among children and
adolescents, focusing on sex and age differences, using a web-based protocol launched on
a large internet community.

To our knowledge, this study is the first to use the internet to examine self-perceived
health and stress in large cohorts of children, adolescents and young adults.
Furthermore, as a secondary objective, we explored possible changes in the percentages
of self-reported health complaints over a 3-year period from 2007 to 2010.

Methods
The present study used the internet to assess psychosomatic health in young people using
well-established questions,4
10
11 with the beneficial result of having a high
number of respondents in each age and sex category. Each subject could log into her or
his own ‘LunarStorm corner' and voluntarily choose to complete the
questions on the community site, which would make the subjects more likely to provide
honest answers. Compared with the response rates obtained from telephone or mail
questionnaires, the number of responders per day may seem somewhat low. We received
responses from 100 000 to 150 000 individuals per day, which represents
approximately 36% of the entire population of members (1.2 million).

Data were collected via internet-based questionnaires consisting of three parts: (1) a
single question about ‘stress,’ launched on the internet on a single day
in January 2005. (2) Eight questions about subjective health that were completed between
26 May and 28 June 2005. One question was delivered on each of eight separate days. (3)
The same eight questions (comprising a composite measure of subjective health),
delivered to smaller groups of randomly selected 15–20-year-olds on the same day
in May 2007 and then again to a new age-matched group of randomly selected adolescents
and young adults in May 2010. The subjects had complete freedom regarding whether to
complete or abstain the questionnaire.

Apart from the single question about stress, the aforementioned eight questions were
developed and tested for reliability and used by the Swedish National Board of Health
and Welfare (http://www.socialstyrelsen.se)
in studies of the psychological health and well-being of children and adolescents. The
composite measure of subjective health4 comprised
the following items: difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, suffers from
headaches, suffers from stomach-aches, feels tense, poor appetite, feels low and feels
dizzy. The response categories for all of these items, which were delivered in question
form, were ‘don't know’; ‘no, never’; ‘no,
seldom’; ‘yes, sometimes’; ‘yes, often’ and
‘yes, always’. The outcomes from psychometric Rasch analysis of the
psychosomatic problems (PSP) scale have been reported in previous papers.15
16 The analysis confirmed the appropriateness of
considering somatic and psychological problems as interacting parts that constitute a
higher-order unidimensional construct (psychosomatic health). The scale showed valid
psychometric properties and met the measurement requirements of invariance and proper
item categorisation. The Rasch model further revealed that from a general level of
analysis, the eight items were invariant among students with good health and among those
with bad health. Importantly, these eight questions also work invariantly across time;
that is, there is no differential item functioning with respect to the year of
investigation, which is a prerequisite for repeated analysis, as in the present
study.

The item about stress was ‘How often/seldom do you feel stressed?’,
and the response categories were ‘yes, very often’; ‘yes,
often’; ‘yes, sometimes’; ‘no, seldom’; ‘no,
very seldom’; ‘no, never’ and ‘don't
know’.

Initially, we placed one question per day on LunarStorm's website, which was one
of the first web communities to be established in Sweden. At the time of our
investigations in 2005 and 2007, LunarStorm was the largest internet community in
Sweden. It had 1.3 million active members and approximately 360 000 unique
visitors per day who spent approximately 40 min per visit on the site (TNS
Gallup/Red Measure, Nielsen/Net Ratings). Eighty-three per cent of
15–20-year-olds in Sweden were LunarStorm members, and 25 of 30 pupils in every
secondary school class were members (Lunarworks AB/SCB). The gender distribution of
members was 53% women.

Members saw the question after login, and only one answer per login was allowed and
counted. We focused on children, adolescents and young adults from 10 to 24 years
old. The percentage of LunarStorm members in each age class in Sweden ranged from 20% to
88%, with the highest values (>80%) for adolescents between 13 and
16 years of age (Statistics Sweden, http://www.scb.se). The reason why we placed one question per day instead
of presenting the whole eight-item questionnaires at one single occasion was that the
web community administrator had the experience that using such long composite
questionnaires decreased the participation rate substantially. However, after receiving
high response rates on the separate items, we decided to include the whole eight-item
questionnaire at one specific time point.

The first set of eight questions was released on the internet on a single day in 2007 to
a group of 15–20-year-old subjects who were randomly selected by the community
websites using statistical methods. Children and younger adolescents were not included
as they were in the protocol that presented one question per day. We chose to focus on
15–20-year-olds because of their higher response rate. Because questions released
on separate days would attract a very large number of responders, we were able to divide
the subjects into gender groups and into various age groups (online table 1). In yet
another internet-based protocol using the same eight questions described above to
determine self-perceived health trends, the subjects were randomly selected in both May
2007 and in May 2010 to respond to the questions. These groups comprised approximately
1500 subjects aged 15–20 years (online table 2).

Ethical approval was obtained from the chairman of the review board. According to the
ethical guidelines, posting questionnaires on the internet does not require ethical
approval from a committee. However, we choose to discuss these issues thoroughly with
the chairman and received full approval.

Statistical analyses
The Mann–Whitney U test and the Kruskal–Wallis and χ2
tests were used. Each of the possible responses to each of the eight questions in the
Likert format was assigned a number (‘no, never=1’; ‘no,
seldom=2’; ‘yes, sometimes=3’; ‘yes,
often=4’ and ‘yes, always=5’), which was
multiplied by the response frequency and then averaged. The same procedure was
performed with the item about stress, and the response categories were ‘yes,
very often=6’; ‘yes, often=5’; ‘yes,
sometimes=4’; ‘no, seldom=3’; ‘no, very
seldom=2’; ‘no, never=1’; the answer
‘don't know’ was not included in the statistical calculations.
Statistical significance was considered when p<0.05.

Results
Consistently more girls answered the questions, and there was an age-group-related
decline in the severity of self-perceived health; however, girls still reported higher
frequencies of psychological ill health during the whole investigated age span. The peak
of problems experienced occurred in adolescents aged 16–18 years, and
females perceived the most problems.

Item about stress
The single question about stress received 148 395 responses (85 330
girls) from 10- to 24-year-olds. The vast majority of this population was between 10
and 24 years old. When analysing the total population, we found that 30% of
the women and 19% of the men considered themselves stressed very often (figure 1). Similarly, the response ‘yes,
often’ was provided more often by women: 17% versus 10% in men
(p<0.0001). When the 10–24-year-old population was divided into age
subgroups, we found that 16–18-year-old males and females reported the highest
degree of stress (very often): 22% for men and 37% for women (figure 2, p<0.0001). The lowest number of subjects
responding ‘yes, often’ to stress was in the 10–12-year-old
group. Consistently, females were significantly more likely to report higher levels
of stress (‘very often’ and ‘often’) than males from 10
to 24 years of age. The percentage of males responding ‘yes, very
often’ to the stress question remained relatively constant at 20% from 13 to
24 years of age, while the percentage of females responding ‘yes, very
often’ increased until they reached 16–18 years old and levelled
off for those who were 19–24 years old. However, this older female
group still showed statistically significantly higher values for self-perceived
stress than males of the same age (figure 2).
Men of all ages chose the alternative response ‘no, never’ to the
question about stress statistically more frequently than women (figure 2).

Figure 1 Bars depict the percentage of ‘never’ to ‘very
often’ responses to the question ‘How often/seldom do you feel
stressed?’ for 10–24-year-old females and males. The total
number of respondents was 148 395. For the statistics, see the text.

Figure 2 Bars demonstrate the percentage of ‘never’ and ‘very
often’ responses to the question ‘How often/seldom do you feel
stressed?’ divided by sex and age. The numbers in the graph
represent the number of responding individuals. The statistics are reported in
the text.

Eight questions presented via the internet on separate days to
10–24-year-olds
Given that these questions were placed one at a time, the response frequency varied
between 12 000 and 45 000 subjects, who were mainly in the
10–12-year-old and 13–18-year-old age groups, respectively; the
response frequencies for all eight questions were similar (online table 1). When all
the possible responses to all eight questions were considered, we found that men of
all age groups scored higher in terms of self-perceived health compared with women
(p<0.0001). The only exceptions in which there were no differences between
males and females occurred in the 10–12-year-old group regarding difficulty
concentrating (p=0.11) and in the 19–24-year-old group regarding
difficulty sleeping (p=0.16).

An analysis of the four age groups' responses to all the questions (except for
the question regarding poor appetite) revealed that the older the subjects, the
poorer their self-perceived health (p<0.0001). Both women and men demonstrated
poorer self-perceived health the older they were (p<0.0001 for both, except
for p=0.04 for poor appetite in women). However, men reported fewer headaches
(p=0.02) and better appetite (p=0.003) with increasing age. When we
adjusted for the differences in sex, we found poorer self-perceived health with
increasing age (p<0.0001), with the exception of poor appetite
(p=0.52), which received opposite overall responses for men and women, as
described above. Similarly, when we adjusted for differences in age, we found better
self-perceived health in men than in women (p<0.0001).

Eight questions regarding self-perceived health presented together on the
internet in 2007 and 2010
Men reported better self-perceived health than women for all eight questions in the
2007 questionnaire (p<0.0001). The results were similar in 2010, with men
reporting better self-perceived health than women regarding headache, stomach-ache,
feeling tense, poor appetite, feeling low and feeling dizzy (p<0.0001) as well
as difficulty sleeping (p=0.002). The difference between men and women
regarding difficulty concentrating was not statistically significant (p=0.06).
There were subtle differences between the overall responses to the 2007 and 2010
questionnaires. Men demonstrated better self-perceived health in 2007 versus 2010
regarding feeling low, poor appetite, feeling tense, and difficulty sleeping and
concentrating (online table 2). Women presented a similar pattern of better
self-perceived health, with the exception of poor appetite (no change). The items
stomach-ache, headache and feeling dizzy remained unchanged from 2007 to 2010 for
both sexes (online table 2).

Discussion
We found marked differences between the sexes regarding psychosomatic symptoms, with
females reporting higher degrees of stress compared with males across the large age span
between 10 and 24 years of age. These symptoms appeared to be most pronounced
between 16 and 18 years of age and then declined, supporting and extending the
results of Hagquist.4 Similar findings using the
same eight questionnaire items were reported previously4
10; however, these findings came from smaller
regional studies that administered the questionnaires in person (by distributing them in
schools). The present study used the internet to assess psychosomatic health in young
people using well-established questions,4
10
11 with a high number of respondents in each age
and sex category. The fact that each subject could voluntarily and anonymously choose to
complete the questions on the community site could have made the subjects more prone to
provide honest answers.

As shown in the present study and what has been noted previously4
11 is that women are more likely than men in the
same age group to report feeling stressed across both childhood, adolescence and as
young adults. Notably, while females seem to increase their reporting of stress and
psychosomatic symptoms from childhood to young adults, similar variables are remarkably
constant from 13 to 24 years of age in males. These salient sex differences may
be explained by the fact that there are real differences in stress levels and
psychosomatic symptoms between the sexes or that girls are more self-aware and
reflecting and therefore more able to assess their psychological health or that it is
more culturally acceptable for girls to report psychosomatic symptoms or a combination
of the factors above. Boys might be more inclined to express themselves more physically,
like being more active in sports or pursue other forms of acting out behaviour.10


For several, but not all, of the questions, self-perceived health was better in 2007
than in 2010 for both men and women perhaps reflecting the financial crisis that emerged
in 2008. Although the changes between 2007 and 2010 were quite small, and the time
elapsed was perhaps too short, we did note similar differences between men' and
women' responses in 2005, 2007 and 2010. Self-perceived health was undoubtedly
worse for women than for men, irrespective of age; this finding is supported by earlier
studies5
6 and the results of Osika et
al,12 who used Beck Youth Inventory
questionnaires.

Our data, together with the results of previous studies,4
8
12
13
17 point unequivocally to impaired self-reported
psychological and psychosomatic health in the young, and the prevailing situation and
trend do not seem to be improving. The psychosomatic health of young women is of
particular concern, given the increase in complaints that appears to have occurred over
the past 20 years, as indicated by surveys in Sweden.4 However, the figures regarding alcohol problems, criminality and
suicide are much higher for males than for females in the 16–24-year-old
group.10


Given that the majority of the subjects in the present study were school-aged, the
school environment is an important factor to consider. Previous reports established
links between the school environment and the psychological and psychosomatic symptoms of
school children.9
18 In fact, Hjern et al
13 demonstrated an association between school
stressors, such as harassment by peers, schoolwork pressure and being treated poorly by
teachers, as well as psychosomatic pain and psychological problems, reflected as
sadness, irritability, and feeling unsafe and nervous. In the light of our demonstrated
sex differences also during school age, one may surmise that factors related to school
environment might affect girls and boys differently.

Methodological considerations and limitations
The eight-item scale we used was validated in several studies as an appropriate means
of estimating the subjective health complaints of children and adolescents. The
instrument was also examined with the Rasch model, for which invariance is
essential.16
19 There are few data available regarding
internet-based surveys of psychological health among young people; thus, there are
few validation analyses. Donker et al
14 validated a brief web-based screening
questionnaire for common mental disorders with follow-up phone interviews, using a
‘gold standard’ interview guide to assess the presence of DSM-IV
disorders in the previous 6 months. Their questionnaire screened for common
mental disorders. However, the subjects in the present study could not be identified;
thus, such a validation was not possible.

A study by Mangunkusumu et al
20 demonstrated good agreement between
responses to questionnaires that were handed out manually and those administered via
the internet. Notably, the internet approach received more favourable evaluations,
even though it also took place in a school milieu. A major advantage of the present
study was that the subjects could choose whether to answer the questions while in a
familiar private and comfortable environment. Furthermore, such administrative
factors as data transcription, the risk of excluded values and ‘odd’
answers and the concern that other people might read the answers can be overcome by
computer- and internet-based surveys. Thus, internet surveys assessing psychological
health and well-being issues appear to be quite suitable for use with young
people.

Approximately 350 000 people logged in on a given day, raising the possibility
of selection bias. Because the subjects were anonymous, we could not investigate
selection effects. However, a recent study using the internet for health-related
topics was independent of gender, age and diagnostic group in a group of patients
with psychosomatic disorders.21 Although the
design of that study was not entirely comparable with the present study, it is an
indication of that there was limited selection bias in our study. Additionally, the
response rate obtained at LunarStorm was very high for such a generalised
internet-based survey.

Conclusions
A relatively high percentage of young people, particularly females
16–18 years of age, had psychosomatic complaints that did not seem to
improve between 2007 and 2010. A considerable worsening of these complaints occurred
from the age of 12 onwards in both sexes. Internet-based survey assessment appears a
valuable tool for examining self-perceived health in young people over a broad range
of ages.
