Salmen M, Ewy GA, Sasson C. Use of cardiocerebral resuscitation or AHA/ERC 2005
Guidelines is associated with improved survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: a
systematic review and meta-analysis. BMJ Open
2012;2:e001273.

Figure 1 in this article was mislabelled and should have been: "Figure 1
AHA versus ERC versus cardiocerebral resuscitation characteristics." Figure 2 should
have been: "Figure 2 Flow chart depicting the outline of study selection
process." Figure 3 should have been: "Figure 3 Forest plot of pooled ORs:
cardiocerebral resuscitation versus AHA 2000 studies.

In addition, the second sentence of the first full paragraph of page 5 contains an
error. It is stated "Pooled OR of survival to hospital discharge for this subgroup was
2.98 (5% CI 1.92 to 4.62) (figure 3))". In fact, this needs to be “(figure 4)”, and not the figure
4 that is currently included in the manuscript. The correct version of figure 4 is
below. The correct label should be "Figure 4 Forest plot of ORs for
witnessed ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia survival: cardiocerebral
resuscitation versus AHA/ERC 2000 studies." The second paragraph on the fifth page, left
column, should then read: "Eight of the nine studies using AHA/ERC 2005 Guidelines
demonstrated improved survival to hospital discharge for use of AHA/ERC 2005 compared to
AHA/ERC 2000 Guidelines, a result that was statistically significant in five out of nine
studies (figure 5)."

We apologise for these errors.
