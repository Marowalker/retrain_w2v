Sampson R, Cooper J, Barbour R, et al. Patients’ perspectives on the medical primary–secondary care interface: systematic review and synthesis of qualitative research. BMJ Open 2015;5:e008708. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008708

In Table 1, the row commencing with First author reference “Beech 36,” should have the following linked text under the column heading “Objective”:

‘To seek patients perceptions of care received across and within organisational boundaries.’

instead of the following text:

‘To explore the perspectives of patients receiving treatment for CRC and compare priorities and attitudes in rural and urban areas.’

In the ‘Findings’ section, fourth paragraph, the sentence reads:

‘Included studies originated from 10 countries and comprised a total of 689 patients (range 7–53 per study).’

It should read:

‘Included studies originated from 10 countries and comprised a total of 661 patients (range 7–95 per study).’
