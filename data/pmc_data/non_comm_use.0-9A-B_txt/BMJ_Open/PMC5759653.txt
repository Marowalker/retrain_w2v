Overactive bladder (OAB) especially OAB with incontinence, influences an individual's lifestyle behavior and impairs quality of life and interfere with daily activities. Since the OAB is diagnosed based on subjective symptoms, the patients reports, is used in the assessment and management of patients with OAB. Therefore it needs to assess the severity of OAB and evaluate the treatment outcome with an objective diagnostic tool. Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) is appropriate tool because it can survey all complexities of OAB symptoms and has a graded response for severity score. The aim of this study is assessment of translation and validity of Persian version of OABSS questionnaire.

Methods
One hundred, menopausal women aged 45 years or older who had at least one urgency episode with or without urge incontinence in the last 3 days, lasting at least 3 months were recruited at the outpatient gynecology clinics of 2 university affiliated hospitals in Tabriz. Patients were excluded if they had significant stress incontinence or mixed stress/urge incontinence where stress was the predominant factor, indwelling catheter, urinary tract infection, and pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical treatment for OAB during last 4 weeks.

For confirmation OAB, all of participants were asked and directed to completed bladder diary, 3 days before the first visit. To determine diagnosis of urinary tract infection, a urine analysis was taken from each participant at the same time. Patients excluded if they could not complete correctly their 3-day urinary diary at visit 1 (Week0) according to the instructions or had bacteriuria/pyuria. The diary was recorded episodes of urgency, incontinence, nocturia and number of incontinence pads.

All eligible patients completed a socio- demographic questionnaire, Three- day bladder diary, Persian version of OABSS and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Overactive Bladder (ICIQ-OAB) at the first visit (week 0) Then, subjects were instructed to attend the retest visit approximately 14±2 days after the ﬁrst visit where the same questionnaires (except of socio demographic questionnaire) were documented.

The translation and adaptation process was conducted with using forward- backward translation approach. For evaluation construct validity, we used of convergent validity with using of ICIQ-OAB Persian version. For measuring reliability test re-test reliability was calculated. Internal consistency was evaluated by measuring Cronbach Alpha.

Results
This study was performed between Aprils to July 2016. Out of 274 patients who were evaluated, 100 were recruited in the study. One hundred twenty four individuals had not inclusion criteria and 30 participants did not complete the first diary. The mean (SD) age of participants was 54.3 (4.0) and 89% of participants were housewife. Cronbach alpha coefficient for OABSS was 0.79.

Conclusion
The results of this study was demonstrated that Persian version of OABSS has acceptable validity and reliability.
Table 1 The results of convergent validity with ICIQ and test re-test reliability were summarized
