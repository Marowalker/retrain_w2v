Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and severe neurodegenerative disease caused by motor neuron death. There have as yet been no fundamental curative medicines, and the development of a medicine for ALS is urgently required. Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based drug repurposing identified an Src/c-Abl inhibitor, bosutinib, as a candidate molecular targeted therapy for ALS. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bosutinib for the treatment of patients with ALS and to explore the efficacy of bosutinib on ALS. This study is the first clinical trial of administered bosutinib for patients with ALS.

Methods and analysis
An open-label, multicentre phase I dose escalation study has been designed. The study consists of a 12-week observation period, a 1-week transitional period, a 12-week study treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period. After completion of the transitional period, subjects whose total ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score decreased by 1–3 points during the 12-week observation period receive bosutinib for 12 weeks. Three to six patients with ALS are enrolled in each of the four bosutinib dose levels (100, 200, 300 or 400 mg/day) to evaluate the safety and tolerability under a 3+3 dose escalation study design. Dose escalation and maximum tolerated dose are determined by the safety assessment committee comprising oncologists/haematologists and neurologists based on the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity in the first 4 weeks of the treatment at each dose level. A recommended phase II dose is determined by the safety assessment committee on completion of the 12-week study treatment in all subjects at all dose levels. The efficacy of bosutinib is also evaluated exploratorily using ALS clinical scores and biomarkers.

Ethics and dissemination
This study received full ethical approval from the institutional review board of each participating site. The findings of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at scientific conferences.

==== Body
Strengths and limitations of this study
This is the first study to use an Src/c-Abl inhibitor, bosutinib, for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and is considered to be the first step in the development of a molecular-targeted therapy for ALS.

This study presents a novel type of protocol design by combining the safety study of oncology and the efficacy study of neurology.

Limitations are the open-label and single-arm designs for safety and tolerability.

Introduction
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an intractable neurodegenerative disease caused by the death of motor neurons resulting in progressive skeletal muscle weakness. The worldwide incidence of ALS is approximately 2 per 100 000 persons per year.1 About 10% of patients with ALS have familial inheritance, and in Japan,2 around 30% of those patients have SOD1 gene mutation.3 Although the disease mechanism of ALS is still unknown, motor neuron death and accumulation of misfolded proteins are essential pathological characteristics of the disease. In the late stage of the disease, patients lose their spontaneous motor function and present respiratory failure. The survival period is within 3–5 years after onset if a mechanical ventilator is not adopted.4 To date, riluzole5 and edaravone6 have been approved for ALS treatment, although there are no fundamental curative medicines.

We previously identified bosutinib, an Src/c-Abl inhibitor, as resulting in an increase in the survival rate of ALS motor neurons derived from familial ALS with SOD1 mutation and from sporadic ALS patients’ induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Bosutinib improved the impaired autophagy, reduced the accumulation of misfolded proteins and attenuated the energy shortage of ALS patient motor neurons.7 Furthermore, treatment with bosutinib attenuated the ALS-related phenotypes of ALS model mice.7 8 Penetration of the blood–brain barrier was confirmed by a previous report.9 Based on these findings, we hypothesised that bosutinib, as a molecular targeted therapy, would attenuate the progression of muscle weakness and elongate the survival period of patients with ALS according to its pathomechanism-dependent effects, and thus we designed the clinical trial of bosutinib for patients with ALS.

Bosutinib is a selective inhibitor of Src/c-Abl tyrosine kinase, approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). In September 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved bosutinib for the treatment of CML, chronic, accelerated or blast phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, for those who are resistant to or who cannot tolerate other therapies including imatinib. Then, FDA granted accelerated approval of bosutinib for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML in December 2017. Although known frequent adverse effects include diarrhoea, thrombocytopenia and liver transaminase elevations,10 from the results of past clinical trials with patients with CML, it became clear that the safety of bosutinib can be managed. However, because the disease-related physical conditions of patients with ALS are different from those of patients with CML, evaluation of the safety and tolerability of bosutinib in patients with ALS was planned to be conducted in the present study. Also, evaluation of the efficacy of bosutinib in patients with ALS using ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R)11 and biomarkers was designed to be conducted in an exploratory manner.

Methods
Study design
This study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicentre, phase I dose escalation study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of bosutinib for determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in patients with ALS. Efficacy is also evaluated exploratorily.

The study consists of a 12-week observation period, a 1-week transitional period, a 12-week study treatment period and a 4-week follow-up period (figure 1). Subjects who have been receiving riluzole are allowed to continue to take riluzole during the 12-week observation period (with the dosage remaining unchanged), but they must stop taking riluzole from the beginning of the 1-week transitional period. After completion of the transitional period, subjects whose total ALSFRS-R score decreased by 1–3 points during the 12-week observation period will receive bosutinib for 12 weeks to evaluate its safety and tolerability in patients with ALS. All ALS drugs including riluzole will be prohibited during the bosutinib treatment period. In this study, three to six patients with ALS will be enrolled at each of the four bosutinib dose levels (100 mg/day (dose level 1), 200 mg/day (dose level 2), 300 mg/day (dose level 3) or 400 mg/day (dose level 4)) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational drug (bosutinib) under a 3+3 dose escalation study design13 (figure 2). The dose will be escalated by one dose level at a time; no skipping will be allowed. Dose escalation and MTD will be determined based on assessment by the safety assessment committee consisting of oncologists and haematologists, as well as a neurological expert who is also an ALS expert, as measured by the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for 4 weeks after initiating each dose level. The definition of DLT is shown in box 3. RP2D is the dosage selected according to the results of a phase I study for uses in future studies and will be projected as a recommended clinical dose for patients with ALS. Thus, in order to confirm its suitability for long-term clinical administration, RP2D will be selected comprehensively based on the evaluation of all safety data obtained (including DLT, dose intensity and other relevant data throughout the treatment period), as well as pharmacological data, exploratory endpoints and other relevant data.

Box 3 Definition of DLT
Grade 4 neutropenia (<500/mm3) persisting for >7 day duration or Grade 4 white cell count decrease for >7 day duration (<1000/mm3).

Febrile neutropenia (ANC<1000/mm3 and fever ≥38.5°C).

Grade 4 thrombocytopenia >48 hour duration or with bleeding requiring platelet transfusion.

Any Grade 3 or 4 clinically evident non-haematological toxicity

except for ≥Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea unless subject is on optimal medical therapy, or

electrolyte abnormality requiring hospitalisation, or is life-threatening.

≥66% of bosutinib doses that cannot be completed due to an adverse event related to the investigational drug (during the first 4 weeks of treatment and the entire 12 weeks of treatment).

An event otherwise determined as a DLT by principal (sub) investigator and the safety assessment committee.

Any clinically significant ≥Grade 2 toxicity that requires >14 days to resolve (to ≤Grade 1 despite optimal medical therapy).

Remarks: Respiratory failure is a very important clinical event for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Thus, dyspnoea, hypoxia, pneumonitis, pulmonary oedema and pulmonary fibrosis according to CTCAE V.4.03 will be considered as ‘clinically relevant ≥Grade 2 adverse events.’

Toxicity of bosutinib in patients with ALS is not known. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) criteria may be modified or added if it is considered necessary to include additional DLT criteria deemed appropriate for patients with ALS based on information accumulated from this study.

The target sample size of this clinical trial is 12–24 subjects. The number of subjects at each dose level of this study will depend on the results of the DLT assessments.

Outcomes
The primary endpoint is DLT during the first 4 weeks of treatment with bosutinib, and during the study treatment period (12 weeks). Adverse events, abnormal laboratory test results, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature), ECG and chest X-ray findings are evaluated as secondary endpoints. Adverse events are graded based on the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.4.03. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be conducted for subjects who have serious adverse events. Changes in ALS clinical score including total ALSFRS-R score and in the grade of the Japan ALS severity classification, and changes from the baseline of %FVC and grip power are evaluated as exploratory endpoints. Changes in blood neurofilament L (NF-L) and phosphorylated neurofilament H (pNF-H) during the observation period and the study treatment period are also evaluated as exploratory endpoints.

Data analysis and statistical method
The frequency of DLT during the study treatment period will be analysed for each dose level. The frequencies of adverse events during the study treatment period are analysed for each dose group. Onset timing, severity and the relationship of the study drug to adverse events are summarised. The respective correlations of changes in total ALSFRS-R score versus blood NF-L and blood pNF-H will be assessed.

Patient and public involvement
Patients and the public were not involved in the design of this study.

Registration
This study has been planning since March 2019 to March 2021, and participating four sites in Japan.

Discussion
This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of bosutinib for the molecularly targeted treatment of patients with ALS as well as explores the efficacy of bosutinib on ALS. The potential efficacy of bosutinib for patients with ALS has already been identified by an approach applying iPSC-based drug repurposing.7 We previously developed a phenotypic screen system to evaluate compounds with a readout of motor neuron survival using ALS patient-iPSCs with SOD1 mutations.7 Application of the screen revealed that bosutinib increased the survival rate of ALS motor neurons. This drug was also effective for sporadic ALS patient-iPSC models. Thus, we designed the clinical trial for ALS patients with SOD1 mutation and for patients with sporadic ALS, with the expectation that bosutinib will become a candidate molecularly targeted drug for ALS.

Bosutinib is a therapeutic agent used for the treatment of patients with CML, and the accumulated data of previous clinical trials presenting the safety of bosutinib can also be managed in patients with CML. However, evaluation of the safety and tolerability of bosutinib in patients with ALS is required in order to support the development of bosutinib for the treatment of ALS. This clinical trial was designed as a ‘triple 3 design’ by a combination of the safety study, the 3+3 dose escalation study design of oncology and the efficacy study, with a 3-month observation period for uniform subject inclusion, of neurology.

Safety information has been accumulated from clinical studies of bosutinib in patients with CML. Known frequent adverse effects of bosutinib include diarrhoea (70%), thrombocytopenia (35%) and liver enzyme abnormalities (alanine aminotransferase increase of 31%, aspartate aminotransferase increase of 23%) according to the Bosutinib Trial in First-Line Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment (BFORE) trial, which demonstrated the efficacy of bosutinib as first-line treatment in adult patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML.10 While diarrhoea is the most commonly reported adverse event, it is generally manageable by dietary advice to avoid dairy products, high fat content and spicy food before anti-diarrhoeal agents.10 Patients with haematological adverse events or liver transaminase elevations are managed by dose interruption or reduction.10 The occurrence and management of adverse events in patients with ALS seem to be comparable to those with CML. While referring to the accumulated clinical data of CML, this study was designed to evaluate any unacceptable adverse events that specifically occur in patients with ALS, as well as the treatment tolerability in patients with ALS. Given that a 4-week DLT evaluation period was included in the phase I/II study to determine MTD in patients with CML (NCT00811070), a 4-week DLT evaluation period is included in this study to determine MTD with bosutinib in patients with ALS. In addition to MTD, this study determines RP2D considered optimal for patients with ALS. After discussion with the regulatory authority referencing the clinical data of CML, 12 weeks of the study treatment period is considered necessary to determine RP2D in the current study. Regarding the dose, a 400 mg dose of bosutinib has been approved by FDA as a first-line treatment for CML. For the non-oncology study of bosutinib, a phase 2 study has been conducted in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, in which bosutinib at starting doses of 200 and 400 mg/day was administered.14 Thus, up to 400 mg of bosutinib dose was selected for evaluation of the safety and tolerability for patients with ALS in this study. Regarding the drug interaction, CYP3A inhibitors/inducers are prohibited because bosutinib is primarily metabolised by CYP3A. Drugs affecting gastric pH are also prohibited because blood concentration of bosutinib may be decreased, resulting in reduced efficacy.

Patients with ALS eventually develop degeneration of both upper and lower motor neurons, but their symptoms and disease processes vary.15 In the early stage of the disease, only upper or lower motor neuron signs may manifest themselves. Some patients also continue to exhibit either one of the motor neuron signs for relatively long periods of time. Especially, ALS patients with an SOD1 mutation often do not meet typical ALS diagnostic criteria because they lack upper motor neuron signs, and they sometimes present a different clinical prognosis from sporadic ALS,16 showing slow progression in some cases. Thus, inclusion criteria contained special provisions for ALS patients with an SOD1 mutation.

The variety of clinical symptoms and disease progression speed among patients is one of the reasons that cause difficulty for clinical trial evaluation. In the current study, an observation period of 12 weeks was established to enable the evaluation of ALS patients with uniform progression speed, the same as in previous clinical trials with edaravone, which was approved for ALS to cause a delay in motor function decline.6 To explore the efficacy of bosutinib, a change in ALS clinical score such as the ALSFRS-R score, the grade in Japan ALS severity classification, a change from baseline of %FVC and a change in grip power are all evaluated as exploratory endpoints. In addition, blood NF-L levels and pNF-H levels, which have been reported to be increased in blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with ALS,17–19 are also evaluated as an indicator of the effectiveness of bosutinib. These biomarkers might indicate the degree of motor neuron death, and its alteration might reflect the effect of bosutinib treatment.

This study is the first to use an Src/c-Abl inhibitor, bosutinib, for patients with ALS, and it presents a novel type of protocol design by combining a safety study for oncology and an efficacy study for neurology. This is a phase I study for the safety and tolerability evaluation, and the number of subjects was limited. Therefore, it will be necessary to conduct further safety and efficacy evaluations in the following phases. This study is considered to be the first step in the development of a molecularly targeted drug for ALS therapy.
