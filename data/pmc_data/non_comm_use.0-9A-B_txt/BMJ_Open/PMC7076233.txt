Effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy in reducing sickness absence among young employees with depressive symptoms: study protocol for a large-scale pragmatic randomised controlled trial.

This article was previously published with errors.

We found two small errors in description of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. First, the requirement of further 6 months job contract is not needed as this information will be obtained from the employer’s register. Second, even though the Mental Hub portal itself is available also in Swedish and English, its iCBT for Depression programme is currently available only in Finnish.

The errors are corrected by first amending the inclusion criterion (3) in the 'Inclusion criteria' sub-section of the methods as follows: “continuously employed by the City of Helsinki for at least 6 months before recruitment” as well as similarly removing the words “permanent contract or a minimum of 6 months of fixed-term contract left” from the exclusion criteria presented in figure 1. The revised figure is included below:





In addition, the exclusion criterion number (3) in the 'Exclusion criteria' sub-section of the methods needs to read as follows: “not able to read Finnish well (the intervention is available only in Finnish)”; as well as similarly removing the words “Swedish or English” from the exclusion criteria presented in figure 1 (above).

Moreover, the wording “at least 6 months of contract left” should be removed from the 'Recruitment' sub-section of the methods. In the 'Treatment' sub-section of the methods the sentence on accessing the Mental Hub needs to be amended as follows: “The Mental Hub can be used on a laptop, PC, tablet or smartphone and can be accessed only in Finnish”.
