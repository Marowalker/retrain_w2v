To investigate the association between self-reported sleep duration, sleep quality
and the prevalence of diabetes in a contemporary sample of Chinese adults.

Design
Cross-sectional survey.

Setting
Community-based investigation in Xuzhou, China.

Participants
16 893 Chinese men and women aged 18–75 who fulfilled the inclusion
and exclusion criteria were enrolled.

Primary and secondary outcome measures
Self-reported quality and duration of sleep were obtained by questionnaire, and
type 2 diabetes was assessed by fasting blood glucose. Sleep quality was
categorised as good, common or poor. Sleep duration was measured by average hours
of sleep per night, with categories of ≤6 h, 6–8 h and
≥8 h. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the
association between sleep duration or sleep quality and diabetes.

Results
Both poor quality of sleep and short sleep duration (≤6 h) were
associated with increased prevalence of diabetes, with higher rates in relatively
healthy Chinese people. Compared with the group with good quality of sleep and
6–8 h sleep duration, diabetes was the most prevalent in individuals
with poor sleep quality and ≤6 h sleep duration (OR 1.41, 95% CI
1.07 to 1.85) and in those with poor sleep quality who slept ≥8 h
(OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.26), even after adjustment for a large number of
further possible factors.

Conclusions
The results suggest that sleep of poor quality and short duration is associated
with diabetes.

Article summary
Article focus
To describe the status of type 2 diabetes in people in Xuzhou, China, and its
association with sleep duration and sleep quality.

Key messages
Type 2 diabetes was related to sleep duration and quality.

People with short sleep duration and poor sleep quality had a higher risk of
type 2 diabetes.

Strengths and limitations of this study
A strength of the study is the large sample.

Limitations include the cross-sectional design, sleep time and sleep quality
were self-reported.
==== Body
Introduction
The prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase and affects an estimated 92.4
million people in China.1 It has become a major
public health problem in the country. Ageing, being female, obesity and an unhealthy
lifestyle are generally considered to be risk factors for diabetes, but an increasing
number of studies have shown that diabetes is associated with sleep quantity and
quality. A prospective study including 6599 initially healthy, non-diabetic men with a
mean±SD age of 44.5±4.0 years suggested that sleep disturbances
were associated with diabetes prevalence in middle-aged men after a 14.8-year
follow-up.2 The Sleep Heart Health Study with a
sample size of 1486 subjects showed that sleep duration of 6 h or less or
9 h or more was associated with an increased prevalence of diabetes and glucose
intolerance, compared with sleep duration of 7–8 h per night, after
adjustment for confounders.3 Mallon et
al
4 demonstrated that difficulty maintaining sleep
and short sleep duration (≤5 h) were associated with an increased
incidence of diabetes in men. The Massachusetts Male Ageing Study recruited more than
1100 men, and those reporting shorter and longer sleep duration were two and three
times, respectively, as likely to develop diabetes over the period of follow-up.5 Hayashino et al confirmed that
medium and high frequencies of difficulty initiating sleep were associated with a higher
incidence of diabetes in relatively healthy Asian workers, even after adjustment for a
large number of further possible factors.6


Experimental studies have shown that sleep deprivation and disturbed sleep tend to
decrease glucose tolerance and compromise insulin sensitivity,7
8 which suggests that habitual short sleep
duration may lead to insulin resistance by increasing sympathetic nervous system
activity, raising evening cortical levels and decreasing cerebral glucose utilisation.
The increased burden on the pancreas from insulin resistance can compromise beta cell
function and lead to type 2 diabetes over time.9–11


However, these studies were carried out in Europe, the USA and Japan.4–9
12 They therefore do not represent populations
across the globe, particularly those from the Indian subcontinent (where type 2 diabetes
is highly prevalent) or Africa.13 It is also not
clear whether the results are applicable to the Chinese population. There is increasing
evidence that the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes varies with ethnicity.14


In the present study, we examined the relation of self-reported habitual sleep time,
sleep quality and diabetes in a large community-based sample in China.

Methods
The data were part of a cross-sectional survey of ‘Risk factors of diabetes
mellitus among residents living in Xuzhou city’ which was conducted from March to
November 2008 with a sample size of 23 742 subjects (11 676 men and
12 066 women) aged 15–75 years from urban and rural areas of Xuzhou
City selected by multistage stratified random sampling.15 In our study, we excluded subjects who were aged <18 years,
pregnant, on antihypertensive medication, or suffering from any cardiovascular disease,
stroke, neuropathy, psychosis, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, prediagnosed diabetes, ache and any other diseases.
Those who had missing information on sleep duration or sleep quality were also excluded.
Face-to-face interviews were carried out by trained physicians and public health workers
using a standardised questionnaire to collect sociodemography, lifestyle and
health-related information. Altogether, 16 893 adults (7702 men and 9191 women)
with complete data were included in our analysis. Of these, 954 had type 2 diabetes
mellitus.

The study protocol was approved by Xuzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention. All
participants provided written informed consent.

Key measurements
A subject was defined as having diabetes if the diagnosis had been made by a doctor
or if the subject was receiving antidiabetes therapy (insulin and/or tablets) or if
two fasting blood samples showed glucose concentrations according to the current WHO
definition of diabetes.16


Self-reported sleep quality during the previous year was recorded in three categories
(good, common or poor). Subjects were asked to rate difficulties with initiating and
maintaining sleep on a five-point scale (1, no problems, average <1 day
per month; 2, minor problems, average 1–3 days per month; 3, moderate
problems, average 4–7 days per month; 4, severe problems, average
8–15 days per month; 5, very severe problems, average
≥16 days per month). Good sleep was defined as no or minor problems,
common sleep as moderate problems, and poor sleep as severe or very severe problems.
Sleep quantity was measured as self-reported average total hours for a night's
sleep during the previous year, and was categorised as ≤6, 6–8 and
≥8 h per night.

Age, gender, current employment status, level of education, cigarette smoking,
alcohol intake, physical activity, family history of diseases including diabetes,
hypertension, heart disease and cancer were assessed using a standardised
questionnaire. Employment status was categorised as manual, non-manual, unemployed
and retired. Education was categorised into below high school, high school and above
high school level. Lifestyle variables included cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking
and physical activity level. Cigarette smoking was defined as having smoked at least
100 cigarettes in their lifetime. Information was obtained on the amount and type of
alcohol that was consumed during the previous year, and alcohol drinking was defined
as the consumption of at least 30 g alcohol per week for 1 year or
more. Regular leisure-time physical activity was defined as participating in moderate
or vigorous activity for no less than 30 min per day at least 3 days a
week. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by
height in metres squared. BMI was categorised as under weight
(≤18.5 kg/m2), normal weight
(18.5–24.0 kg/m2) and overweight/obese
(≥24.0 kg/m2).17


Statistical analysis
We evaluated the distribution of sleep quality and duration in the total population
and how it varied by incident of diabetes. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
used to assess associations between the three-level sleep difficulty complaints and
subjective sleep duration with diabetes by adjustment of age, sex, education
categories, smoking, employment status, alcohol consumption, BMI categories and
regular exercise. The interaction between sleep quality and duration was analysed by
a −2 log likelihood ratio test in logistic regression models. The last
logistic regression models included nine dummy variables to represent all nine
possible combinations of sleep quality and duration, with good sleep and
6–8 h sleep duration as reference. The minimum statistical significance
level for all analyses was p<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed on a
Lenovo computer using the statistical analysis program SPSS V.11.5.

Results

Table 1 presents characteristics of the study
population. Over half of the subjects were women. The mean±SD age was
45.1±14.4 years, and 19% of the subjects were ≥60 years of
age. Most (83.9%) of the subjects were employed. Only 6.6% had received a high school
education or above. With regard to lifestyle factors, 18.7% were current smokers, 18.2%
were alcohol drinkers, and 69% reported no regular exercise. Furthermore, 33.4% were
obese. Overall, 28.4% of the subjects reported good sleep quality, and 7.5% reported
poor sleep quality in the preceding year; 19.4% of adults slept for 6 or fewer hours,
and 18.8% reported 8 or more hours sleep. The prevalence of diabetes in the population
was 5.6% (5.9% in women and 5.4% in men), and was 4.8%, 5.3% and 11.7% in subjects with
good, common and poor sleep quality, respectively. It was higher in those with poor
sleep quality than in those with good sleep quality (11.7% vs 4.8%, χ2
= 82.48, p<0.01) and common sleep quality (11.7% vs 5.3%,
χ2 =81.02, p<0.01). No significant difference was
found between the good sleep and common sleep groups (4.8% vs 5.3%,
χ2=2025, p>0.05). With regard to sleep quantity, the
prevalence of diabetes was 7.2%, 5.1% and 6.0% in subjects who slept for 6 or fewer
hours, 6–8 h and 8 and more hours, respectively. It was significantly
lower among subjects in the 6–8 h group than those in the group receiving
6 or fewer hours (χ2 =20.94, p<0.01) and those receiving
8 or more hours (χ2 =4.63, p<0.05). No significant
difference was found between subjects sleeping for 6 or fewer hours and those sleeping
for 8 or more hours (χ2 =3.32, p>0.05).

Poor sleep quality was associated with a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (OR
1.76, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.71) independent of possible confounders. A sleep duration of
≤6 h increased the risk of diabetes (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.51,
p<0.01) compared with the group that slept 6–8 h. No significant
association was found between sleep duration of ≥8 h and diabetes (OR
0.87, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.11) (table 2).

Model 1, adjusted for age, sex, education, occupation and BMI. Model 2,
adjusted for age, sex, education, occupation, BMI, family history of diabetes,
smoking status, alcohol consumption and hypertension. The interaction between
sleep quality and sleep duration was not statistically significant. Thus these
two variables were entered into the model separately, except for model 3, in
which the results were adjusted for each other.

Subjects with poor sleep quality and sleep duration of ≤6 h were more
likely to have diabetes than those with good quality sleep who slept for
6–8 h (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.85). The joint association of poor sleep
and sleep duration of ≥8 h was a non-significant increase in the
association with diabetes (OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.85 to 2.26). For subjects with common or
good sleep, no interaction with sleep duration was found (table 3).

Discussion
We found that poor sleep quality and short sleep duration were associated with an
increased prevalence of diabetes in the Chinese population, independently of potential
confounders such as age, obesity, family history of diabetes, alcohol consumption,
smoking, physical activity and other diseases. Previous epidemiological studies on the
relationship between sleep duration or sleep quality and diabetes have shown
inconsistent results. A representative cross-sectional study including 372 144
participants found that insufficient rest or sleep resulted in a slightly increased
incidence of diabetes.12 In that study, the
investigators controlled for age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, BMI and other comorbid
conditions, but did not control for hypertension, any cardiovascular disease or any
other diseases that could increase the risk of diabetes or sleeping difficulty.17 A prospective Japanese study showed that
persistent (>4 years) complaints of medium and high frequency of
difficulty initiating sleep were associated with an increased incidence of diabetes.
However, two potential confounders of sleep, disordered breathing and depression, were
not controlled for in this study.6 In our study,
after controlling for these risk factors for diabetes and sleeping difficulty, we found
that poor sleep quality was associated with a significant risk of diabetes. When we
introduced the criterion of short sleep duration into the definition of poor sleep
quality, we noticed a strong and significant effect on the association of poor sleep
quality with diabetes. Subjects with poor sleep quality who slept for ≤6 h
had an association with diabetes that was 125% higher than for subjects who slept for
6–8 h with good sleep quality. In contrast, those who had poor sleep
quality and slept for ≥8 h did not show a reduced incidence of diabetes
compared with the control group. Subjects with common sleep quality who slept for
≤6 h or ≥8 h had a slightly higher incidence of diabetes
compared with the control group. Interestingly, we did not find that sleep duration of
≤6 h or ≥8 h increased rates of diabetes. Thus sleep
quality, not sleep duration, seemed to be the important factor. The joint association of
poor sleep and short sleep duration with diabetes found in our study is consistent with
a previous report.18


Previous studies found that self-reported short sleep duration is associated with
diabetes.3
5
6
18 Some studies have reported that long sleep
duration is also associated with diabetes.12
13
15 Our findings were not consistent with these
reports. This may be due to no exact data on sleep time being collected in our study.
Furthermore, short sleep duration may be related to factors such as an underlying sleep
apnoea or sleep disordered breathing,19
depressive symptoms20 and endocrine
disorders,21 which may increase risk of
diabetes.

Several potential limitations to our study deserve mention. First, as it is a
cross-sectional design, we cannot determine a causal relationship between sleep quality,
sleep time and diabetes. Second, information on sleep quality and sleep duration was
self-reported. Therefore we cannot compare our results directly with those from other
studies that used objective sleep duration or polysomnographic measures of sleep
disturbance. Thus misclassification and bias in our results is a possibility. Third, we
were not able to control for some important and well-known risk factors—for
example, snoring, which is known to be associated with diabetes.22 Fourth, we did not look at diet, which has been found to be
causally related to type 2 diabetes and may also have influenced sleep patterns.23
24 Fifth, participants were limited to the
18–75-year-old age group, and therefore the study does not represent the whole
population.

In summary, in this large sample of Chinese adults, poor sleep quality and short sleep
duration were found to be positively associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes in
relatively healthy subjects. However, it seems that no measures are currently required
to target sleep specifically to decrease the prevalence of diabetes in China. Further
prospective studies are needed to examine the association.
