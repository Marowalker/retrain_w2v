Business-IT Alignment Evaluation is One of the most important issues that managers should monitor and make decisions about it. Dashboard software combines data and graphical indicators to deliver at-a-glance summaries of information for users to view the state of their business and quickly respond. The aim of this study was to design a dashboard to assess the business-IT alignment strategies for hospitals organizations in Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

Methods
This is a functional-developmental study. Initially, we searched related databases (PubMed and ProQuest) to determine the key performance indicators of business-IT alignment for selecting the best model for dashboard designing. After selecting the Luftman model, the key indicators were extracted for designing the dashboard model. In the next stage, an electronic questionnaire was designed based on extracted indicators. This questionnaire sends to Hospital managers and IT administrators. Collected data were analyzed by Excel 2015 and displayed in dashboard page.

Results
The number of key performance indicators was 39. After recognition the technical requirements the dashboard was designed in Excel. The overall business-IT alignment rate in hospitals was 3.12. Amir-aalam hospital has the highest business-IT alignment rate (3.55) and vali-asr hospital has the lowest business-IT alignment rat (2.80).

Conclusion
Using dashboard software improves the alignment and reduces the time and energy compared with doing this process manually.
