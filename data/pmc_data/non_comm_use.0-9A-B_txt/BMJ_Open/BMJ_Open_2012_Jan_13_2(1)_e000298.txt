The impact of different weaning methods on food preferences and body mass index
(BMI) in early childhood is not known. Here, we examine if weaning
method—baby-led weaning versus traditional spoon feeding—influences
food preferences and health-related outcomes.

Design, setting and participants
Parents (n=155) recruited through the Nottingham Toddler laboratory and
relevant internet sites completed a questionnaire concerning (1) infant feeding
and weaning style (baby-led=92, spoon-fed=63, age range
20–78 months), (2) their child's preference for 151 foods
(analysed by common food categories, eg, carbohydrates, proteins, dairy) and (3)
exposure (frequency of consumption). Food preference and exposure data were
analysed using a case–controlled matched sample to account for the effect
of age on food preference. All other analyses were conducted with the whole
sample.

Main outcome measures
The primary outcome measures were food preferences, exposure and weaning style.
The secondary outcome measures were BMI and picky eating.

Results
Compared to the spoon-fed group, the baby-led group demonstrated (1) significantly
increased liking for carbohydrates (no other differences in preference were found)
and (2) carbohydrates to be their most preferred foods (compared to sweet foods
for the spoon-fed group). Preference and exposure ratings were not influenced by
socially desirable responding or socioeconomic status, although an increased
liking for vegetables was associated with higher social class. There was an
increased incidence of (1) underweight in the baby-led group and (2) obesity in
the spoon-fed group. No difference in picky eating was found between the two
weaning groups.

Conclusions
Weaning style impacts on food preferences and health in early childhood. Our
results suggest that infants weaned through the baby-led approach learn to
regulate their food intake in a manner, which leads to a lower BMI and a
preference for healthy foods like carbohydrates. This has implications for
combating the well-documented rise of obesity in contemporary societies.

Article summary
Article focus
Although numerous studies have focused on when to introduce solid foods into an
infant's diet, there is a dearth of evidence concerning the impact of
different weaning methods on food preferences and health.

Baby-led weaning is suitable for most infants and is associated with reduced
maternal anxiety about weaning and feeding and a maternal feeding style that is
low in control.

Key messages
Our study suggests that baby-led weaning has a positive impact on the liking
for foods that form the building blocks of healthy nutrition, such as
carbohydrates.

Baby-led weaning promotes healthy food preferences in early childhood, which
may protect against obesity.

Strengths and limitations of this study
One limitation of the present study is that we relied on self-report. However,
using a self-report questionnaire is a standard approach when dealing with food
preferences, and we controlled for self-presentation effects (none were
uncovered).

A second criticism that may be levied here is our reliance on a small sample
size. However, we used a matched sample and report robust effect sizes.

Introduction
How should solid foods be introduced to infants? Do different weaning methods
impact on food preferences and health-related outcomes? These questions are
currently unanswered. To date, the focus on weaning has been on when, rather than how,
to wean.1 Recently, much media attention has
centred on baby-led weaning,2
3 which emphasises infant self-feeding with solid
finger foods from the outset rather than parental spoon feeding with purees. Baby-led
weaning is suitable for most infants4 and is
associated with (1) reduced maternal anxiety about weaning and feeding5 and (2) a maternal feeding style, which is low in
control.6 However, the impact of this weaning
method on food preferences and health-related outcomes is not known. Thus, we examined
the influence of different weaning styles on food preference, body mass index (BMI) and
picky eating in early childhood.

Methods
Parents of 155 children (aged 20–78 months) were recruited to the study
between June 2006 and January 2009. The baby-led group (n=92) was recruited
through an advert posted on relevant internet sites; the spoon-fed group (n=63)
was recruited from our toddler laboratory database.

Participants completed a questionnaire (a standard research tool for examining food
preferences7) concerning the following: (1)
infant feeding and weaning style. (2) Child's preference (rated from 1
‘loves it’ to 5 ‘hates it’) for 151 foods (adapted from
Wardle et al
8), which was analysed by standard food
categories, for example, carbohydrates, proteins, dairy,9 and included a category called ‘meals’ for whole meals like
lasagne.8 See supplementary information in
etable 1 for details. (3) Exposure (frequency of consumption) rated from 1 ‘more
than once a day’ to 7 ‘less than once per month’, as this is
closely related to food preferences.10
11 (4) Picky eating (a single item requiring a
‘yes/no’ response to ‘Would you classify your child as a picky
eater?’). (5) Child height and weight for BMI calculation (weight in
kilograms divided by the square of the height in metres). In the spoon-fed group, these
measurements were made using standardised procedures when assessed in our laboratory. We
calculated BMI z-scores using the WHO Growth Standards.12 BMI percentile ranks were calculated using the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) Child and Teen BMI Calculator13 and the National Health Service (NHS) Choices BMI Calculator14 (which uses UK90 reference data for children
older than 4 years15 and WHO Growth
Standards data for children younger than 4 years).12 (6) Socioeconomic status (via postcode using the Income Deprivation
Affecting Children Index (IDACI) score and rank for 2007 and National Statistics 2001
Area Classification of Super Output Areas and Data Zones)).16 These measures are frequently used in social and health-related
research with children and by government departments.17 Socioeconomic status has been shown to influence eating practices and
behaviours.18−20 (7)
Marlowe–Crowne Social Desirability Scale (short form).21 Parents who returned a completed questionnaire were entered into
a prize draw for £50. Ethical approval was granted by the University of
Nottingham School of Psychology Ethics Committee. Parents completed a consent form prior
to participation in the study.

Data were analysed using PASW Statistics V.18.0.22 Pearson's correlations and t tests were used to examine
relationships between outcome measures and groups, respectively. Non-parametric tests
(Spearman's rank correlations, Mann–Whitney U) were used when there was
significant skew or problems with homogeneity (Bonferroni-corrected for multiple
comparisons). Missing food preference data were accounted for in the calculation of
averages across categories. Cases with other missing data (eg, BMI) were excluded from
analyses. Preliminary analyses showed that exposure and preference ratings were not
contaminated by socially desirable responding and only liking for vegetables was
significantly related to socioeconomic status (IDACI score)
(rs=−0.25, p=0.005) (higher social class associated with
increased liking for vegetables).

As no formal definition of baby-led weaning exists,6 parental self-report of weaning style was used to generate weaning groups.
To verify the veracity of self-reported weaning style, responses to items concerning
weaning methods were interrogated. This confirmed that the baby-led group were more
likely to have handled food from the introduction of solid foods, were given finger
foods earlier and fewer had been spoon-fed with pureed foods at all (table 1). Thus, the two groups differed
significantly on criteria typically used to characterise baby-led weaning.6

Results
The baby-led group was significantly younger than the spoon-fed group (table 1), and overall age and preference were
significantly correlated (collapsed across food categories, rs=0.28,
p=0.001; and for the individual food categories of dairy,
rs=0.35, p<0.0001; snacks, rs=0.21,
p<0.009 and meals, rs=0.26, p=0.001). To control for
this effect of age, a case–controlled age-matched sample of 74 participants (37
pairs) was generated to analyse the food preference data (see table 2 for details).

Case-controlled, chronological age-matched pairs were formed.

All cases and controls were matched for age. In 11 cases, matches could be made
using age alone—for each case, there was one control participant of the
same age.

Where there were several control participants who matched a case on age, we
selected the control participant using age and socioeconomic status
(n=20).

Where more than one participant matched on age and socioeconomic status, we
then matched on gender (n=1).

In some cases, no information on socioeconomic status was available so matches
were made using age and gender (n=5).

There was no effect of gender in this matched sample
(χ2=0.22, p=0.82).

* Lower scores indicate greater liking.

Between the two weaning groups, significant differences in preference were found for
only one food category—the baby-led group liked carbohydrates more than the
spoon-fed group (t (72)=−3.11, p=0.003, d=−0.53).
Indeed, carbohydrates were the most liked food category for the baby-led group, whereas
sweet foods were most liked by the spoon-fed group (table 2). The baby-led group also liked proteins (t (72)=−2.71,
p=0.008, d=−0.63) and whole meals
(U=448.00, p=0.02, d=−0.40) more than the
spoon-fed group, but these differences did not survive Bonferroni adjustment.

Next, we investigated the effects of exposure on food preferences in the matched
sample10
11 (table
3). Across groups, comparisons revealed increased exposure to vegetables,
fruit, carbohydrates, protein, meals and sweets in the spoon-fed group. Exposure was
significantly associated with liking for dairy foods (rs=0.58,
p<0.0001), snacks (rs=1, p<0.001), vegetables
(rs=0.47, p<0.0001) and proteins (rs=0.44,
p<0.0001). No association was found for carbohydrates (rs=0.19,
p=0.11), sweet foods (rs=0.19, p=0.11), fruits
(rs=0.10, p=0.39) and meals (rs=0.17,
p=0.14). This suggests that for carbohydrates, the only food category with
significant group differences, weaning style was more influential than exposure on
preference ratings.

* Difference remains significant after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple
comparisons (*0.05/8=0.006).

Finally, we investigated the influence of weaning method on health-related outcomes. BMI
scores (percentile rank) differed significantly between groups (table 1)—lower BMI were associated with baby-led weaning in
the whole sample. (This difference was also evident in the matched sample—NHS
percentile rank (U=276.50, p=0.008) and CDC percentile rank
(U=268.50, p=0.005)). As shown in table
1, the mean BMI percentile rank for the baby-led group was close to the
expected average (percentile rank of 50) for both the NHS and CDC classification
systems. In contrast, the mean percentile rank for the spoon-fed group was above the
average level, indicating that more children in this group were likely to be classed as
overweight.

BMI z-scores were also found to differ significantly between the weaning groups (see
table 4). To investigate this further, we
determined the number of children in each group classified as significantly underweight
(z-score more than −2) and those who were obese (z-score of more than
+2)—clinically the most concerning cases. Using this criterion, we found
there to be an increased incidence of obese children in the spoon-fed group (n=8)
as compared to the baby-led group (n=1). In contrast, more children in the
baby-led group were classified as significantly underweight (n=3) compared to the
spoon-fed group (n=0) (Fisher's exact test, p=0.02, two-tailed). A
similar pattern of results was found when child BMI was classified according to
percentile rank (see table 4).

BMI (WHO z-score) was not correlated with socially desirable responding in the baby-led
group (where self-report of height and weight measurements was used,
rs=−0.13, p=0.29). Also BMI (WHO z-score) did not
correlate with socioeconomic status (IDACI score) (rs=−0.07,
p=0.51) or breastfeeding duration (rs=−0.10,
p=0.29) in the whole sample. (There was also no correlation between BMI scores
and breastfeeding duration in the matched sample (rs=−0.11,
p=0.43)). The same pattern of results was found when using the BMI percentile
rank measures. (No difference between the two weaning groups was found in the prevalence
of picky eaters (table 1)).

Discussion
Understanding the factors that contribute to healthy nutrition in early childhood is
crucial as this could be the optimal time to modify food preferences so as to foster
healthy diets in obesogenic food environments.10
Our findings show that baby-led weaning has a positive impact on the liking for
carbohydrates—foods that form the building blocks of healthy nutrition (ie, those
found at the bottom of the food pyramid).9 This is
a significant finding since, to date, the factors thought to be most influential on
early food preferences are sweetness and familiarity (exposure).10 Consistent with previous research, the spoon-fed group preferred
sweet foods most, whereas the baby-led group most preferred carbohydrates (even though
significantly higher exposure to carbohydrates was reported in the spoon-fed group).

Children weaned using the baby-led method are more likely to encounter carbohydrates in
their whole food format earlier than spoon-fed children as these foods are ideal early
finger foods (eg, toast and pitta breads) so age of introduction may impact on
behaviour. However, our data show that exposure per se did not influence preference for
carbohydrates, so another factor must be driving preference here. Presenting
carbohydrates to infants in their whole food format, such as toast, rather than a pureed
form may highlight awareness of perceptual features (such as texture) that is masked
when food is pureed. Previous research has shown that food presentation significantly
influences food preferences,23 so it is possible
that differences in the presentation of foods across the two weaning groups impacted on
preferences. It is also possible that carbohydrates are easier to masticate compared to
some other foods such as meat (which may be easier to eat when pureed and spoon-fed).
Interestingly, the baby-led group showed increased preference for all food categories
except sweets compared to the spoon-fed group (although this was only significant for
carbohydrates).

Our results also showed that baby-led weaning was associated with lower BMI (in terms of
mean percentile rank) that could not be accounted for by differences in birth weight,
parental BMI or socioeconomic status. The analysis of BMI z-scores revealed an increased
incidence of underweight (the baby-led children (3/63)) and an increased incidence of
obesity (the spoon-fed children (8/63)). It should be noted that there was some missing
data on BMI in the baby-led group (32%). However, in both groups, the vast majority of
the children were of an average/healthy weight (see table 4). In contrast to past literature,24 breastfeeding duration and BMI were not significantly associated. This
discrepancy may be due to the fact that the vast majority of the mothers in this sample
breastfed their babies and for much longer periods of time than might be expected from
past research.25 Nonetheless, duration of
breastfeeding may have a mediating effect, which requires investigation in relation to
the impact that weaning style has on BMI. No difference in the prevalence in picky
eating was found across groups. Moreover, 93.5% of the baby-led group reported that
their child had never experienced a choking incident (a serious concern for parents and
practitioners).2


Our results suggest that baby-led weaning promotes healthy food preferences in early
childhood that could protect against obesity. This finding is of note given the serious
problems with childhood obesity facing many modern societies.26 The baby-led approach was, however, associated with a higher
incidence of underweight relative to the spoon-fed group. The factors underlying this
require exploration in future research.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have examined the impact of
weaning method on food preferences and health outcomes in early childhood. Future
research should determine whether our findings hold for more specialist populations,
such as babies born prematurely or with specific health difficulties. Moreover, careful
consideration should be given to the classification of weaning method. In the present
study, we relied on parents identifying themselves as having used baby-led weaning (and
we checked the reliability of this self-report by asking some specific questions about
their weaning practices). This gave rise to a dichotomous variable—either the
parents used baby-led weaning or they did not. However, it may be more sensitive to
consider weaning methods as a continuum where parents rate the percentage use of pureed
foods in their child's diet over time.5 In
addition, previous studies have shown that parents who used the baby-led approach to
weaning are less controlling and more willing to hand control over to the child when
introducing solid foods.6 Future research needs to
address the contribution of this factor into any effect of weaning method on food
preferences.

A large controlled prospective study is now required, which examines weaning practices
in tandem with the other key factors, including BMI, milk feeding practices (breast vs
bottle/formula fed), socioeconomic status, locus of control and picky eating. In
particular, a study is needed that includes a greater proportion of children who have
been formula/bottle fed in order to compare the relative impacts of weaning method and
milk feeding practices on food preferences and health outcomes in early childhood.
