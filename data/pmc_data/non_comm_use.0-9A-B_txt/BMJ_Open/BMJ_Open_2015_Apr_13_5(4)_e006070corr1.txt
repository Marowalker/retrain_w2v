Guzman-Castillo M, Ahmed R, Hawkins N, et al. The contribution of primary prevention medication and dietary change in coronary mortality reduction in England between 2000 and 2007: a modelling study. BMJ Open 2015;5:e006070.

(1) The Acknowledgement section should read:

We would like to thank Rosalind Raine and Madhavi Bajekal for their work in developing the original IMPACTSEC model. The English IMPACTsec project was conducted by Madhavi Bajekal (MB) and Shaun Scholes (SS). Hande Love set up the worksheet template; SS populated the model and was its custodian. MB ensured the integrity of inputs and outputs and provided SEC-related methodological solutions. Martin O'Flaherty & Nat Hawkins provided support, clinical expertise and generated the therapeutic input. The UCL team was led by Rosalind Raine. Simon Capewell co-ordinated the overall project.

(2) The design section should read:

Design: Retrospective analysis using the IMPACTsec policy model.

(3) ‘Strengths and limitations’ and ‘Summary’ sections should read:

IMPACTsec is the first model to quantify the contributions of population risk factors and primary prevention treatments to recent changes in CHD mortality rates by socioeconomic quintiles.

(4) Appendix/References section has been replaced online to include a version that references Bajekal; no other changes have been made.
