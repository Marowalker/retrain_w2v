Voorham J, Roche N, Benhaddi H, et al. Real-world effectiveness evaluation of budesonide/formoterol Spiromax for the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the UK. BMJ Open 2018;8:e022051. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022051.

It has come to light that Figure 1 (patient flow diagram [prior to matching]) in the previously published article contains errors, as follows:The numbers of BF Turbuhaler patients in the matched study cohort were erroneously given as 253 with asthma and 132 with COPD. These numbers should instead have been 743 and 348, respectively.

The numbers of patients in the combined cohort who were using FS Accuhaler/Diskus and using BF Turbuhaler were erroneously given as 40 540 and 50 351. These numbers should instead have been 40 550 and 50 761, respectively.

A footnote stating that duplicate patients between groups were removed for 1187 patients using FS Accuhaler/Diskus and 965 patients using BF Turbuhaler was omitted.



These errors have been addressed in the corrected version of the figure that is provided together with this correction notice. See the corrected figure below:
