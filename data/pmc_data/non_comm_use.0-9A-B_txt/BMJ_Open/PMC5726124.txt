This article has been corrected since it was published Online First. In the section “Data synthesis and meta-bias(es)”, ‘50%’ should read ‘25%’ in the sentence:

“An I²>25% will be used as a threshold to indicate moderate heterogeneity and potential to use of a random effects model, if there is overall consistency in the direction of effect.”
