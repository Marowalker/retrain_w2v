Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD) is the most prevalent sexual disorder among women that may pop up due to worrying about Body Image (BI). Body image is a complicated concept encompassing the biological, psychological and social factors. The current study aims to analyze the relationship between BI and HSDD among Iranian women in their reproductive age.

Methods
this research is cross-sectional (descriptive –analytical) performed on 1000 woman in their reproductive age (15–49 yrs). The samples have been selected by systematic random sampling method. The data collection tool includes demographics and Sexual Interest and Desire Inventory-Female (SIDI-F) plus the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) for measuring HSDD completed as self-report by the samples. To analyze the data, univariate and multivariate regression test have been applied.

Results
The mean age of the study community has been 32.09±7.33. After adjusting the effect of the confounder variables by logistic regression multivariate analysis, the odd ratio for HSDD in the individuals not satisfied or slightly satisfied with their BI has been OR: 4.2 (95% CI: 1.98–9.05) and OR: 3.9 (95% CI: 2.29–6.65), respectively, times more than those highly contended with their BI.

Conclusion
this study depicted that dissatisfaction with BI is a determinant factor of HSDD. Thus taking this factor into account when acquiring sexual history can be useful order to provide optimal sexual counseling.
