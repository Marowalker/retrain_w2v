Deraas TS, Berntsen GR, Hasvold T, et al. Is a high level of general practitioner consultations associated with low outpatients specialist clinic use? A cross-sectional study. BMJ Open 2013;3:e002041. There are two typographical errors in this article:

The first error appears on page 5, at the end of the Results section. ‘p=0.07' was incorrectly written as ‘p<0.07’ in the sentence ‘The 85+ stratum with medium and large municipalities and the highest mortality now became a negative but still non-significant association (p<0.07)’.

The second error appears in table 3, in row ‘Diff 1–5’, column ‘Medium and large, highest mortality’. ‘−423’ should be ‘+423’.
