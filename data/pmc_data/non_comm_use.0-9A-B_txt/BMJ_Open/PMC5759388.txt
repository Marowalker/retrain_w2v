Visiting is one of the basic requirements of patients, but most doctors and nurses know visiting as a stressor. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the presence of visitors on the quality of patients' treatment.

Methods
In this review, we studied 20 reliable documentations and sources extracted from sites of SID, PUBMED, and magazines inside and outside the country about the presence of visitors, fellows and training them in various sectors and also treatment processes and the results of the reviewed articles were compared.

Results
The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the anxiety and severe physiological changes in patients who had visitors and those who had no visitors. (P<0.05) In addition, the length of delivery in women who had visitors was statistically different and longer than those who had no visitors (P<0.05). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the rates of death in patients who had no visitors and the patients who had visitors (P<0.05).

Conclusion
The presence of visitors has reduced anxiety and death in patients and has prevented severe changes in physiological indicators. Moreover, the presence of visitors reduces the duration of delivery, which of course should be accompanied with proper training.
