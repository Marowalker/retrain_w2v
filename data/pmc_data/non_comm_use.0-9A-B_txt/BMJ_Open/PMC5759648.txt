Standard DISC personality test and researcher-designed questionnaire (about using EBP approach) were used for data collection. Data analyzes were performed through SPSS-V20 software by using One-Way ANOVA and Tukey statistical tests.

Results
The response rate was 86.4 percent. The 81.6 percent of managers were men and mean age of all participates was 46.7 years. The 57.8 percent of managers had academic education in management. Findings showed that the portion of dominant, influential, steady and conscientious personality types were 36.4, 27.3, 13.6, and 22.7 percent, respectively. The mean of using EBP approach was 3.1 of five point scale. The results of One-Way ANOVA showed that the scores of EBP using were different based on personality types (p<0.05). The Tukey's results determined that the mentioned difference was related to conscientious personality type.
