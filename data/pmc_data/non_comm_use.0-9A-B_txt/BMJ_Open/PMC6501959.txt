Tricco AC, Strifler L, Veroniki A, et al. Comparative safety and effectiveness of long-acting inhaled agents for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis. BMJ Open 2015;5:e009183. DOI: 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-009183.

The previous version of this manuscript contains a data extraction error in Table 3 in the line comparing ‘BUDE/FORM vs placebo’. Revising this data extraction error in the sample size resulted in a slight change in the second digits of the MA and NMA estimates; however, the overall conclusions for this comparison remain the same.

­

The line in Table 3 should appear as:

­

BUDE/FORM vs Placebo NMA OR 0.61 (0.43 to 0.87) MA OR 0.52 (0.35 to 0.79) 1 (510)

­

Instead of:

­

BUDE/FORM vs Placebo NMA OR 0.64 (0.45 to 0.91) MA OR 0.55 (0.36 to 0.83) 1 (519)

­

In addition, the NMA odds ratio and confidence intervals are also plotted in Figure 4 of the paper. A revised version of Figure 4 is attached.
