Ethical considerations:

Ethical approval had been obtained from the hospital and university ethics committee, which requires processes to ensure the confidentiality of all data. The purpose, risks and benefits of this study were explained to the patients before they were asked to participate. The patients were assured that participation was voluntary, and that choosing not to participate would not influence their clinical care. The organs of the liver transplant cases involved in this study are from citizens who underwent cardiac death, and were not from executed prisoners. Authors have provided BMJ Open with a note from their hospital to indicate this.
