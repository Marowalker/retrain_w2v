Prevalence of Obesity among childbearing age women has increased markedly in recent decades, and it has become a major health problem with probably impact on mental health of obese women. For many women, returning to prepregnancy weight is a challenge. This study performed to examine the extent to which trimesters of pregnancy and early postpartum depression is associated with weight retention 1 year after childbirth.

Methods
In a prospective cohort study of 307 women enrolled in Project with title “association between prepregnancy BMI and postpartum depression”, 62 women with class 2 and 3 of obesity and 245 with normal prepregnancy BMI, reported depressive symptoms on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and 6-8 weeks postpartum. A score >13 indicated probable depression. Associations between antenatal and postpartum depression with risk of substantial weight retention (at least 5 kg) 1 year after childbirth were assessed.

Results
One hundred and forty nine women (76.8%) with normal prepregnancy BMI were not depressed during or after pregnancy, while these amounts were 22 women (47.8%) in obese group. 32 (16.5%) in normal BMI and 7 women (15.2%) in obese group experienced antenatal depression only, 5 (2.6%) in normal group and 6 (13.0%) in obese group experienced postpartum depression only and 8 (4.1%) in normal group and 11 women (23.9%) in obese group experienced both antenatal and postpartum depression (p<0.001). At 1 year, participants retained a mean of 2.52 kg (range −10 to 17) in normal BMI group and 18.1% retained at least 5 kg and in obese group slightly decrease was shown: −0.02 kg (range −14 to 12) with 11.1% with retained weight at least 5 kg. Binary logistic regression analyses, after adjustment for weight-related covariates, maternal sociodemographics, and parity, antenatal and postpartum depression showed antenatal depression, either alone or in combination with postpartum depression, was not associated with substantial weight retention (odds ratio (OR): 1.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94, 1.10).

Conclusion
The results showed that obese women are most prone to have postpartum depression. However there was no association between substantial weight retention in the first postpartum year in our study, more research with high sample size and all BMI groups are needed. Moreover identifying the other risk factors for weight retention after birth to prevent obesity and its sequels on women to better decision making in prenatal care guidelines contents are required.
