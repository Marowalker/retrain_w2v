chlamydia infection in a cohort of young international travellers (backpackers) and
residents in Australia. BMJ Open 2011;1:e000004.

among women in Durban, South Africa: implications for prevention policy and planning.

References in the manuscript should be re-numbered accordingly.

‘Introduction’ section, page 2, paragraph 1, lines 8-12 should have read:
“In this paper, we use the population attributable risk (PAR), which takes
account of both the odds ratio of specific risk factors and their prevalence in the
population, to provide a quantitative assessment of the potential impact of reducing a
risk factor on disease incidence at a population level.10”

The ‘Statistical analysis’ section, ‘Population attributable
risk’ sub-section, page 2, paragraph 2, lines 2–5 should have read:
“The PAR is formulated as a function of odds ratio (OR) (s) and the prevalence
(p) (s) of the risk factor(s). When there is only one risk factor at two levels (1
versus 0).10”

The ‘Statistical analysis’ section, ‘Population attributable
risk’ sub-section, page 2, paragraph 3, lines 1-3 should have read: “Where
OR is the odds ratios, p is the prevalence of the risk factor in the
population and s indexes the two strata determined by the value of the
risk factor.10”

The ‘Statistical analysis’ section, ‘Population attributable
risk’ sub-section, page 2, paragraph 4, lines 1-6 should have read: “where
OR s and p s, s=1,…,S, are the odds ratios and the
prevalences in the target population for the sth combination
of the risk factors. Full PAR can be estimated by using Equation and interpreted as the
percent reduction expected in the number of HIV seroconversion if all the known risk
factors were eliminated from the target population. In a multifactorial disease setting,
at least some key risk factors such as age and sex are not modifiable. This limits the
practical utility of the full PAR which is based on modification of all variables of
interests. In an evaluation of a preventive intervention in a multifactorial disease
setting, the interest is in the percent of cases associated with the exposures to be
modified, when other risk factors, particularly non- modifiable, exist but do not change
as a result of the intervention. Therefore we derived and used partial PAR which kept
unmodifiable variable(s) unchanged10”.

The ‘Statistical analysis’ section, ‘Population attributable
risk’ sub-section, page 2, paragraph 5, should have read: “where
t denotes a stratum of unique combinations of levels of all
background risk factors which are not modifiable and/or not under study, t=1,…,T
and OR2t is the odds ratio in combination t relative to the
lowest risk level, where OR 2,1=1. As previously, t
indicates a risk factor defined by each of the unique combinations of the levels of the
modifiable risk factors, that is, those risk factors to which the PAR applies,
s=1,…,S, and OR1 is the relative risk corresponding to combinations
relative to the lowest risk combination, OR110”
