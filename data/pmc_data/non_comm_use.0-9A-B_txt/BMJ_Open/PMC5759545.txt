Health librarians also pioneered the concept of evidence based practice within the library profession evidence based library and information practice (EBLIP) and has developed a strong evidence base for their work. This presentation explores the concept of EBLIP within the health library profession and the dual role they play in supporting and undertaking EBP. A range of studies that demonstrate the effectiveness and impact of the services provided by health librarians are summarised to provide an overview of the evidence of the health library profession. The presentation concludes by putting forward the view that being evidence based is an approach that involves: questioning practice, gathering or creating the evidence, using evidence wisely and using professional skills to help others make evidence based decisions.
