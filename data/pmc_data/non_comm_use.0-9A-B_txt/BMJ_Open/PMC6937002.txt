Rafferty E, Guo X, McDonald B, et al. Measurement of coverage, compliance and determinants of uptake in a publicly funded rotavirus vaccination programme: a retrospective cohort study. BMJ Open 2019;9:e031718. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031718.

This article was previously published with errors in Table 3.

In table 3, the data (1.93 (1.73 to 2.16)) is for ‘Rural-Q2’ instead of ‘Rural-Q1’ under the heading ‘Income and location of residence (interaction term)’.

In table 3, the first sub-heading under ‘Gestation age at birth’ should read ‘Term (≥36 weeks)’. Currently, these are split into two lines.

Table 3 columns headers should read as follows:

Column 4: Unadjusted OR for not initiating§ (95% CI)

Column 5: Adjusted OR for not initiating § (95% CI)

Column 8: Unadjusted OR for not completing¶ (95% CI)

Column 9: Adjusted OR for not completing¶,** (95% CI)

The footnotes to table 3 should read:

§: Odds of not being vaccinated with rotavirus vaccine compared with receiving at least one dose of the rotavirus vaccine.

¶: Odds of not being vaccinated with two doses of the rotavirus vaccine compared with receiving at least two doses of the rotavirus vaccine.
