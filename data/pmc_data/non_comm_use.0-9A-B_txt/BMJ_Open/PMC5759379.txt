See: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/Four out of 5 American primary care physicians do believe that addressing social needs of their patients are as important as addressing medical conditions of their patients. There are several researches showing that addressing social determinants of health improve the clinical outcome of the patients considerably. In this review we discuss how physician's evidence based advocacy and negotiation with policy makers may create opportunity for addressing social needs of the patients. The recent research initiative of family physicians in New Mexico, USA that resulted in state level policy making for addressing social needs of the patient will be discussed.
