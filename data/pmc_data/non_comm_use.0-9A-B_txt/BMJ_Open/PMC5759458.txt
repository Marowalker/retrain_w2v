This was a cross sectional study in which 90 post graduate students in Tabriz University of Medical Sciences were selected randomly. Participants take part in 12 Sessions, in which EBM literature search skills were presented by highly qualified Teachers (HQT). Pre- and post-questionnaires and skills tests were developed to measure student' skills concerning EBM literature search. Data were then analyzed by SPSS using T-Test.
