This study aimed to find how Iranian national urologist see the Telegram messaging app to create a virtual community for sharing knowledge, patient management and problem solving by using best evidence.

Methods
Telephone interviews with 50 urologist from Iran (10 residents, 25 urologist and 15 fellow), conducted in the context of use telegram. (We launched Telegram in 2016 and it has 295 members) In the interviews the respondents were asked to give their opinions about frequency of social media use, professional usefulness, popularity, ethics and barriers, evidence based practice and impact of this social media tools on their education, practice and patient management. The interviews were subjects to thematic analysis with an inductive approach.

Results
The result sought to determine how these professionals are using an applicable messaging app-Telegram- and use their learning through this tool in their practice. The most of respondents emphasized the importance of this tool in their medical education in relation to busy and shift working schedule. The respondents saw this tool as a smart innovation for solving problem in their practice. However, they mentioned that in the lack of evidence they could not express their opinion which lead incompetence. The important things for our respondents were to continue their professional communication through online social networking sites but shift working times make them unable to attend the scheduled educational sessions. Therefore, new tools and social network are essential in continues education.
