Sawada H, Oeda T. Protocol for a randomised controlled trial: efficacy of donepezil against psychosis in Parkinson's disease (EDAP). BMJ Open 2013;3:e003533.

1) In the section ‘Methods and analysis’, subheading ‘Primary outcome measure and statistical analysis,’ the following sentence has a typographical error: ‘Primary outcome measure is the time to the occurrence of psychosis from V2 during 48 weeks.’ This should be ‘Primary outcome measure is the time to the occurrence of psychosis from V2 during 96 weeks.’ The study was designed as 96-week of observation period, as described elsewhere in the manuscript, and this was due to a typographical error.

2) In table 1 ‘Multiplicative Parkinson Psychosis Questionnaire score’, the structure is disarranged. The corrected table 1 is below.
