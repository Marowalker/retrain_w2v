Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the inflammatory cytokines which has an important role in inflammation and migration of other inflammatory cells to the atherosclerotic plaques. OX40L is a member of the TNF super family receptor protein. OX40 and OX40 ligand are co-stimulators for T-cells and can increase inflammatory response in atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this study was to determine the association of rs3850641 polymorphism in OX40L gene with premature myocardial infarction.

Methods
This case control study was done on 100 patients with premature acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and a similar number of sex, age and some other cardiovascular risk factor matched healthy people.

Results
The OX40L rs3850641 polymorphism was genotyped, using PCR-RFLP method. AA genotype frequency of rs3850641 SNP was higher non-significantly in Premature AMI, compared to healthy subjects (58.80% vs. 57.50%). AG genotype frequency of rs3850641 SNP was lower non-significantly in Premature AMI, compared to healthy subjects (0.0% vs. 1.40%), also GG genotype frequency of rs3850641 SNP was lower non-significantly in Premature AMI, compared to healthy subjects (41.20% vs. 41.10%), (P>0.05).

Conclusion
The results of this study indicate that the rs3850641 SNP of OX40L gene is not associated with premature AMI in the evaluated population.
