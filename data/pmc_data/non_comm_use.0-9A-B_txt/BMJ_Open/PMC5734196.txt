Laver K, Dyer S, Whitehead C, et al. Interventions to delay functional decline in people with dementia: a systematic review of systematic reviews. BMJ Open 2016;6:e010767. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010767

The data reported in the abstract, text, Figure 2 and Table 2 were incorrect due to an error in the calculation. The effect size for the dyadic interventions is 0.31 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.59) and this information is based on 10 trials with 1359 participants. This is instead of the presented information which reads that 8 trials (988 participants) had an effect size of 0.37 (95%CI 0.05 to 0.69). The authors apologise for this error. The conclusions of the study remain the same.

The corrected Figure 2 is shown below:
