IBD includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is 2 inflammations. Symptoms of IBD include abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever, but symptoms of the intestinal tract or other organ involvement can be seen in abundance. Hematologic Anemia is a common complication of IBD that occurs in 6% to 74% of patients. In other words, anemia is the most common extraintestinal complication. This leads to reduced quality of life, reduce the time wasted at work and frequent admissions. Anemia treatment has a positive effect on quality of life in patients with IBD. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and types of anemia and related factors such as the severity of intestinal disease activity, age, sex, duration of disease in patients with ulcerative colitis is designed.

Methods
In this study, patients with ulcerative colitis in Golestan Research Center of Gastroenterology and Hepatology records and during the last six months has been the result of colonoscopy were recruited with written consent. Check list of index of disease activity was completed for them. Then presented to the laboratory for blood samples and a blood sample to measure hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, B12, folate and TIBC were taken from them. A sample of 55 people. After the measurement data with the results of the statistical tests analyzed the prevalence of anemia and its variants and anemia associated with disease activity index, age, sex, duration of disease was determined last.

Results
This study was conducted with 54 patients with ulcerative colitis. In terms of age, the average age of the participants was 34.13 years (SD) age of 10.49 years. 51.9% of the participants were female and 48.1% were male., 55.6% of patients with mild disease activity and 44.4% had severe disease activity. In people who have severe disease activity, anemia significantly more than those who were moderately active. However, due to the small sample size statistically significant association was not found among them. (P Value>0.05) Prevalence of anemia in patients with ulcerative colitis significant correlation with gender, age and duration of disease. (P Value>0.05) in the prevalence of different types of anemia, 42.4% of patients had anemia of chronic disease. 24.3% had iron deficiency anemia. 6% with B12 deficiency were seen in 27.3% Mixed anemia.

Conclusion
The results show high prevalence of anemia in patients with ulcerative colitis was. Even in many of the patients in the absence of anemia, iron laboratory abnormalities were observed. The age, gender and duration of illness and anemia past relationship was not statistically significant. The incidence of anemia in patients with more severe disease activity, significantly more than those who had mild disease activity. In connection with the frequency of anemia in patients with ulcerative colitis, the most common type of anemia, anemia of chronic disease, and in later grades, anemia Mixed, iron deficiency anemia and anemia caused by B12 deficiency, respectively.
