Hu Z, Zhang Q, Zhou J, et al. The Impact of Multiple Liver Resections Prior to Salvage Liver Transplantation on Survival in Patients with Recurrent HCC. BMJ Open 2015;5:e008429. The 5-year overall survival rate for patients who underwent HR once was 35.3%, not 35.5%, which is the same as the 3-year survival rate. The abstract should be corrected to read as follows:Â 

There were no significant differences between patients who underwent HR once and those who underwent HR more than once with respect to overall or tumour-free survival after receiving SLT. The 1-year, 3-year and 5-year overall survival rates for patients who underwent HR once and those who underwent HR more than once were 72.9%, 35.3% and 35.3% vs 50%, 50% and 50%, respectively (p=0.986), while the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year tumour-free survival rates for these two groups were 66.3%, 55.3% and 44.4% vs 40%, 40% and 40%, respectively (p=0.790).
