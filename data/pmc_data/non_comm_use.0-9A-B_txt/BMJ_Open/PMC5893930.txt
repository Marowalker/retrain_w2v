To describe the characteristics of children and adults with incident type 1
diabetes in contemporary, multiethnic UK, focusing on differences between the
islet autoantibody negative and positive.

Design
Observational cohort study.

Setting
146 mainly secondary care centres across England and Wales.

Participants
3312 people aged ≥5 years were recruited within 6 months of a clinical
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes via the National Institute for Health Research
Clinical Research Network. 3021 were of white European ethnicity and 291 (9%) were
non-white. There was a small male predominance (57%). Young people <17 years
comprised 59%.

Main outcome measures
Autoantibody status and characteristics at presentation.

Results
The majority presented with classical osmotic symptoms, weight loss and fatigue.
Ketoacidosis was common (42%), especially in adults, and irrespective of
ethnicity. 35% were overweight or obese. Of the 1778 participants who donated a
blood sample, 85% were positive for one or more autoantibodies against glutamate
decarboxylase, islet antigen-2 and zinc transporter 8. Presenting symptoms were
similar in the autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative participants, as
was the frequency of ketoacidosis (43%vs40%, P=0.3). Autoantibody positivity was
less common with increasing age (P=0.0001), in males compared with females
(82%vs90%, P<0.0001) and in people of non-white compared with white ethnicity
(73%vs86%, P<0.0001). Body mass index was higher in autoantibody-negative
adults than autoantibody-positive adults (median, IQR 25.5,
23.1–29.2vs23.9, 21.4–26.7 kg/m2; P=0.0001).
Autoantibody-negative participants were more likely to have a parent with diabetes
(28%vs16%, P<0.0001) and less likely to have another autoimmune disease
(4%vs8%, P=0.01).

Conclusions
Most people assigned a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes presented with classical
clinical features and islet autoantibodies. Although indistinguishable at an
individual level, autoantibody-negative participants as a group demonstrated
features more typically associated with other diabetes subtypes.

==== Body
Strengths and limitations of this study
We have studied a large multiethnic cohort of adults and children ≥5
years with clinically diagnosed incident type 1 diabetes in whom pancreatic islet
autoantibodies were measured in a central laboratory.

In routine practice, the initial assignment of a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is a
purely clinical one. The lack of further selection before inclusion in this study
(eg, based on autoantibody status and/or genetic testing) renders the results of
particular relevance to standard clinical care.

Individual autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients were
indistinguishable clinically, but the size and diversity of the cohort permitted
group differences to be detected at high levels of statistical significance,
suggesting diagnostic heterogeneity.

As this was a volunteer study recruiting from mainly secondary care centres,
ascertainment bias could have been introduced.

Provision of a blood sample was optional, and autoantibody status was therefore
available in just over half of the patients. Other than having a higher median
age, this subgroup was representative of the whole cohort.

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that develops at any age but most
frequently in children and young adults.1
Autoantibodies against islet antigens are typically present before, and for a variable
time following, diagnosis.2–6
Once initiated, beta cell damage classically leads to progressive loss of insulin
secretion and a need for lifelong insulin treatment.

The diagnosis of T1D is a clinical one but may be supported by the presence of one or
more of the autoantibodies to islet cell antigens. In routine care, autoantibody
status may not be available at diagnosis and may never be checked (management guidelines
differ, with some not recommending their routine measurement or restricting measurements
to situations where there is clinical doubt).7–9 Previous studies suggest that 80%–90% have detectable
autoantibodies at disease onset,5 10 with a
background autoantibody prevalence of around 2% in the young general population.11 Autoantibody positivity may be lower in some
non-white ethnic groups.12–16 There is however uncertainty around the clinical and demographic
correlates of autoantibody status in incident disease in an unselected multiethnic
cohort including children and adults, using well characterised, validated assays. The
After Diabetes Diagnosis REsearch Support System, supported by the National Institute
for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Research Network (CRN), recruits people with
incident T1D from centres across England and Wales. We aimed to characterise these
people with reference to their heterogeneity, focusing on the associations of
autoantibody status with variation in presentation characteristics.

Methods
Ethics approval
The project complies with the recommendations for research on human subjects by the
18th World Medical Assembly, Helsinki 1964 and later revisions and the International
Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (Topic E6–10
June 1996). Protocol details have been reported previously17 and are therefore described in brief only.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
People with a clinician-assigned diagnosis of T1D aged ≥5 years were
recruited within 6 months of diagnosis. Written informed consent was obtained for all
participants.

Data collection
On recruitment: demographic information; medications including insulin(s); medical
history, including that of autoimmune disease; family history of diabetes; blood
pressure; weight and height; HbA1c; and fasting or random blood glucose. A
diagnosis of ketoacidosis was recorded if clinically assigned or if hyperglycaemia
was accompanied by acidosis and either ketonaemia or ketonuria.17 Ethnicity was self-reported as one of 16
categories.17


Project-specific blood sampling and measurement of islet autoantibodies
Sample donation was voluntary.17 Where
collected, autoantibodies to glutamate decarboxylase (GADA), islet antigen-2 (IA-2A)
and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8A) were measured in sera using established radiobinding
assays18 19 in a single central
laboratory. Antibodies to both major ZnT8 isoforms, defined by the polymorphic amino
acid at position 325 (arginine, ZnT8RA or tryptophan and ZnT8WA), were
measured separately. Thresholds for autoantibody positivity were set at the 97th
percentile of 974 control samples for GADA, the 98th percentile of 500 control
samples for IA-2A and the 97.5th percentile of 523 healthy schoolchildren for
both ZnT8RA and ZnT8WA. Positive autoantibody status was defined as positive for one
or more of GADA, IA-2A or either form of ZnT8A. In the 2015 Islet Autoantibody
Standardization Program Workshop, the assay sensitivities and specificities achieved
were 74% and 96.7% for GADA, 72% and 100% for IA-2A, 60% and 100% for ZnT8RA and 46%
and 100% for ZnT8WA, respectively.

Data analysis
Children were defined as aged <17 years. Body mass index (BMI) was derived
as a z-score for children using WHO (2007) reference data.20 As a criterion for adiposity shared between children and
adults, we applied WHO-recommended definitions of ‘normal’ weight
(z-score <1, equivalent percentile <84.13% for children;
BMI <25 kg/m2 for adults, both including underweight)
as distinguished from ‘overweight’ (z-score ≥1,
percentile ≥84.13% for children,21 BMI ≥25 kg/m2 for adults,22 both including obese). Parental and sibling
history of diabetes was recorded. No attempt was made to differentiate between
diabetes types in the family history. Variables were categorised as
‘individual characteristics’ and ‘diabetes presentation’.
We analysed data from participants recruited between 1 September 2011 and
30 April 2016, with data querying and verification completed in November
2016.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using StataCorp 2013 (Stata Statistical
Software: V.13). Median and IQRs were used to summarise continuous
variables. Categorical variables were summarised as percentages. The Mann-Whitney U
test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for between-group comparisons of continuous
variables. χ2 testing was used for comparisons of categorical
variables. Individual characteristics were explored as predictors of diabetes
presentation and antibody status in univariate logistic and linear regression
analyses. Multiple logistic and linear regression were used to establish the
independence of predictors. A significance level of P<0.05 (two sided) was
taken as a guide to interpretation (actual p values down to P<0.0001 are reported
throughout).

Patient involvement
Patient and public involvement groups within the NIHR CRN representing people with
diabetes, and representing children and young people, had input into the design of
the patient information sheets, consent forms and recruitment strategies. After the
start of recruitment, a patient advocate group was established to have input into
aspects of study design and conduct, such as the procedures for accessing the data
and stored biological samples, and communication with and engagement of participants,
people with T1D and healthcare professionals. The group is made up of adults with T1D
and the parents of children with T1D. Results are disseminated to participants via
newsletters, and other information about the study is published on the study website
and on social media.

Results
Overview of the cohort
Individual characteristics
Data were analysed for 3312 participants recruited with incident T1D (1879 (57%)
males and 1946 (59%) children from 146 centres; table 1). The slight male predominance (57%) was more prominent
in adults than in children (61% vs 54%, P<0.0001). Islet autoantibodies were
measured in the 1778 participants who donated an optional blood sample. For
individual characteristics, data recording was >98% complete for all
variables except BMI (and ‘overweight’: 88%) and records of having a
sibling with diabetes (91%). Data recording for diabetes presentation features
was >98% complete for all variables except symptom duration (94%).
Sample sizes for incomplete data are reported in the tables. Of the total cohort,
people of white European origin comprised 91% (n=3021), Asian (not Chinese) 3%
(n=107), African-Caribbean 2% (n=63) and other or mixed ethnicity 3% (n=121).
Median time from diagnosis to recruitment was 71 days (IQR 40–119) and to
blood sampling was 75 days (IQR 42–126). Of those with body weight
measured (n=2911), 35% were classified as overweight or obese, more commonly in
adults than children (41% vs 31%, P<0.0001). Where records of body weight were
available within 28 days of diagnosis (n=554), 35% were also overweight or obese
(adults 40% vs children 29%, P<0.005).

*The children’s B MI z-score expressed as a percentile (median
(IQR)) was 67 % (39%– 89 %) (n = 1676).

Data collection for ketoacidosis at diabetes presentation was based on a record of
it being assigned clinically or of hyperglycaemia accompanied by acidosis and
either ketonaemia or ketonuria.

The relationships between diabetes presentation and individual
characteristics
The main presenting features (table 1) were:
osmotic symptoms (polyuria and/or polydipsia): 96%, weight loss: 85%, and fatigue:
82%. Ketoacidosis was identified at clinical presentation in 42%. Another autoimmune
disease was present in 6%, 15% had a parent with diabetes and 8% had a sibling
with diabetes.

The influence of age
Increasing age was independently associated with an increased prevalence of
ketoacidosis, weight loss and fatigue at presentation, decreased prevalence of
osmotic symptoms and longer symptom duration (figure
1). In accord with its relationship with age, ketoacidosis was less
common in children than adults (39% vs 45%, P=0.0002). Although
statistically significant, the differences between children and adults in
other presenting symptoms were small (osmotic symptoms: 97% vs 95%, P=0.001;
weight loss: 82% vs 89%, P=0.0001; fatigue: 78% vs 88%, P=0.0001,
respectively), as were differences in symptom duration (median, 3 vs 4 weeks,
P=0.0001).

The influence of gender
Female sex was independently associated with longer symptom duration (figure 1). Median symptom duration in females
and males were 4 and 3 weeks, respectively (P=0.0001).

Associations with ethnicity
There were no significant associations between ethnicity and initial clinical
presentation, including ketoacidosis, which was equally likely: in white Europeans
and non-whites (41% and 44%, respectively; P=0.3).

Family history of diabetes
Having a parent with any diabetes was associated with a lower probability of
presenting with ketoacidosis (figure 1; 12%
vs 18%, P<0.0001). The same applied to those who had a sibling with diabetes
(figure 1; 5% vs 10%, P<0.0001).

Other autoimmune disease
The presence or absence of another autoimmune disease had no significant influence
on diabetes presentation.

Description of the cohort in whom autoantibodies were measured
Children comprised 38% of the subgroup of 1778 participants who provided a blood
sample for autoantibody measurement. The subgroup with blood samples was,
accordingly, significantly older than the full cohort (median (IQR) 21.6
(13.4–32.8) vs 14.6 (10.4–26.4) years, P<0.0001). Other parameters
were similar. One or more autoantibodies were present in 85% of those who donated a
blood sample.

The relationships between autoantibody status and individual
characteristics
The influence of age
Autoantibody positivity decreased with increasing age; adults were less likely
than children to be positive for one or more antibodies (82% vs 90%, P<0.0001).
The decline in autoantibody positivity continued throughout adult life (figure 2). Of the individual autoantibodies,
GADAs were the most frequently observed in adults, with IA-2A and ZnT8A being
relatively more common in children (figure
2). The autoantibody-positive adults were of lower BMI than
autoantibody-negative adults (BMI, median (IQR) 23.9 (21.4–26.7) vs 25.5
(23.1–29.2), P<0.0001), and they were less likely to be overweight or
obese (40% vs 55%, P=0.0001). No relationship to BMI z-score was observed in
children, and there was no independent relationship between overweight/obesity and
antibody positivity across children and adults (figure 1).

Figure 2 The percentage of participants exhibiting islet autoantibodies (any and
individual) in relation to age at diagnosis. GAD, glutamate decarboxylase;
IA2, islet antigen-2; ZnT8, zinc transporter 8.

The influence of gender
Females were more likely than males to be antibody positive (90% vs 82%,
respectively (P<0.0001).

Associations with ethnicity
There was a statistically significant relationship between ethnicity and
autoantibody status (on χ2 analysis, P<0.0001). Among the
three major non-white ethnic groups (Asian, African-Caribbean and other or
mixed ethnicity), numbers with autoantibodies measured were small (n=46, 36 and
51, respectively) and the proportion with autoantibody positivity did not differ
significantly (70%, 64% and 82%, respectively; P=0.1). People of non-white ethnic
origin were therefore grouped, and comparisons were limited to white
European versus non-white ethnic origin. White European ethnicity was
independently associated with a higher prevalence of autoantibody positivity
compared with the combined non-white group (86% and 73%, respectively;
P<0.0001; figure 1).

Family history of diabetes
People who had a parent with diabetes were less likely than those without to have
autoantibodies (figure 1; 16% vs 28%,
P<0.0001, table 2).

*The children’s BMI z-scores expressed as percentiles (median

(32%-83%) in the autoantibody negative (n=56).

**Median and IQRs for symptom duration were identical: 4 (2–8);
mean and SD is shown to clarify the direction of difference.

Other autoimmune disease
Another autoimmune disease was present in 204 participants and 117 of those in
whom autoantibodies were measured. A history of another autoimmune disease was
positively associated with pancreatic islet autoantibody positivity (P=0.01, figure 1), being present in 8% of the
autoantibody-positive participants and 4% of the autoantibody-negative
participants (table 2).

The relationship between autoantibody status and diabetes presentation
A statistically significant relationship between positive autoantibody status and
diabetes presentation was restricted to a very small increase in prevalence of
osmotic symptoms (97% vs 94%, P=0.02, table
2). There was no significant difference in rates of ketoacidosis at
presentation between autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative participants
(43% vs 40%, P=0.3, table 2).

Discussion
For the first time, relationships between autoantibody status (measured centrally in a
single reference laboratory) and phenotypic features in incident T1D are reported from a
large, unselected, multiethnic population of both children and adults. The study was
conducted with support from the NIHR CRN with most participants recruited from
specialist centres. Based on estimates of T1D incidence and population
demographics,23 2420%–25% of
eligible incident cases in England and Wales were recruited.

Male predominance is unusual for an autoimmune condition but has been reported in adults
with incident T1D.25 In young children, the sex
ratio has been reported to be close to unity.26
In the present study, the male excess was observed also in children, although the excess
was less marked than in adults. Symptoms at presentation were as expected.27 28 Although weight loss was common, average
body weight at the time of recruitment was normal, and many participants were overweight
or obese, especially adults. This was apparent even in people with body weight
measurements obtained within 28 days of diagnosis, belying the belief that patients
presenting with T1D are underweight. An association between increased BMI and increased
risk of progression from autoantibody positivity to development of diabetes in at-risk
relatives has been reported previously.29 Symptom
duration was similar to that reported previously by others and was shorter in children
than adults.30 31 This may reflect parental
vigilance of unwell children or a more insidious onset of clinical disease in older
people.

The overall frequency of ketoacidosis at diagnosis (42%) was high and slightly more so
in adults than children. It occurred with similar frequency in white European and
non-white ethnic groups. The figure of 42% is higher than in previous reports from the
UK (23% in a recent national paediatric audit,32 26%–27% in regional studies33 34), and a range of 13%–80% in those aged <20 years has
been reported internationally.35 A very similar
figure (40.3%) has been reported recently for children in Italy.36 Ketoacidosis at diagnosis is a quality issue as it reflects lack
of awareness of diabetes features among professionals and the general population,32 and efforts to increase awareness lead to
reductions in ketoacidosis at first presentation.37 All methods of estimating the frequency of ketoacidosis at diagnosis have
limitations, often leading to under-reporting.32
Strengths of the current study include the large number of patients and the ability to
confirm or refute the diagnosis where this was in doubt. A limitation is that
ascertainment bias could be introduced because recruitment was mainly from secondary
care, and those who are the most ill at diagnosis may be the most likely to volunteer or
to be referred. The higher ketoacidosis rate in adults versus children in our study
appears at variance with the observation that ketoacidosis or severe ketoacidosis is
more common in younger than in older children.28 33 36 38–40 The current study did not
include children <5 years of age, the group in childhood in whom ketoacidosis
at diagnosis occurs most frequently,41 and this
may have contributed to the apparent children to adult difference. Of course, if such
younger children had been included, this could have increased the overall rate of
ketoacidosis even higher. The lower rate associated with having a parent or a sibling
with diabetes could result from a heightened awareness of symptoms leading to earlier
clinical referral.35 The absence of any
significant ethnic influence on ketoacidosis is at variance with some previous reports
where higher rates were observed in non-white subgroups.42 43


One or more islet autoantibodies were observed in 85% of participants, more commonly in
female than male and in younger compared with older participants. This is compatible
with previous literature from the UK and other countries,8 44–46 although assay differences make such
comparisons difficult. The positivity rate is higher than reported in people with T1D of
non-white ethnic origin,12 13although with
the same caveats and bearing in mind that the previous studies of ethnic influences on
antibody status have been limited in size or age range of population studied. The slight
female autoantibody preponderance has been observed in other studies in young children,
but not in older children and young adults.47 The
higher autoantibody frequency in those with a coexistent autoimmune disease reflects the
clustering of autoimmune disorders observed in T1D and shared genetic
susceptibility.48 Overall, GADAs were the
antibodies most commonly present, while IA-2A and ZnT8A were seen most frequently in
children, findings compatible with previous studies.47 Insulin itself is considered a potential primary autoantigen as insulin
autoantibodies are observed in incident T1D, especially in children.30 31 49 In the current study, most
participants had received insulin therapy for weeks before study entry, and as they
could have developed antibodies to the exogenous insulin, insulin autoantibodies were
not measured. In prospective studies of infants at high genetic risk of T1D, insulin
autoantibodies were often detected earlier than the other islet autoantibodies,50 51 and in consequence, we may have
underestimated the frequency of autoantibody positivity at diagnosis, especially in
children.

Although autoantibodies can be present for years in people with diabetes who do not
require insulin treatment immediately52–54 and are present in some diagnosed clinically with type 2
diabetes,55 they are generally regarded as a
biomarker for T1D. In prospective studies they precede and predict the onset of
T1D.56 They typically disappear, or titres
drop to very low levels, in the years following diagnosis.57 In the autoantibody-negative participants studied here, several
explanations may be proposed. First, insulin autoantibodies were not measured. Second,
autoantibodies to as yet unknown antigens may have been present.58 The identification of tetraspanin-7 as an autoantigen could, for
example, account for some apparently antibody-negative participants,59 although recent data suggest this is unlikely to
account for large numbers.60 Third,
autoantibodies may have disappeared or their levels diminished by the time of sampling.
As all participants were recruited within 6 months of diagnosis, this is unlikely
to be a major factor. Fourth, autoantibodies might develop subsequently, as reported
previously for islet cell antibodies in a small proportion of patients.61 Fifth, some people may have autoimmune T1D
without a humoural response. Finally, people may actually have another diabetes subtype.
The autoantibody-negative participants as a group tended to be older and, if adult, more
overweight. These features are compatible with type 2 diabetes. They were more
likely to have a parent with diabetes, typical of type 2 or monogenic diabetes. They
were more likely to be of non-white ethnicity, more associated with type 2 diabetes.
Those with ketoacidosis could have ketosis-prone diabetes (so-called idiopathic
diabetes)62 as this is difficult to
distinguish from T1D at first presentation. Further studies and follow-up of the cohort
are planned to explore the extent to which T1D without detectable autoantibodies
describes a subgroup of T1D that is distinct from other diabetes subtypes.
