Modifications in learning systems based on the concepts of self-efficacy and self-esteem are among the suggested strategies to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two interactive educational workshops with or without standardized patients (SPs) on midwifery students' self-efficacy in providing sexual health counseling at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran in 2014.

Methods
In this quasi-experimental study, 92 B.Sc. and M.Sc. students of midwifery at Mashhad School of Nursing and Midwifery were randomly divided into two groups. The groups were trained, using one of two interactive educational workshops (with or without SPs) on sexual health counseling (10 hours). Data were collected, using a demographic questionnaire and a self-efficacy assessment tool. For data analysis, paired and independent t-tests were performed, using SPSS version 16.

Results
Two weeks after the intervention, the scores were significantly higher in students who participated in SP-based workshops (76.0±10.9 vs. 66.7±5.9, P<.0001). Two weeks after the intervention, the mean scores of students' self-efficacy in providing sexual health counseling in the two groups were significantly higher compared to their scores at the beginning of the study.

Conclusion
Although both methods could promote students' self-efficacy, the impact of workshops with SPs was more significant. Therefore, integration of this training method in midwifery educational curricula is recommended.
