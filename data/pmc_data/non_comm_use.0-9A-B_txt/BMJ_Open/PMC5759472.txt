Dysmenorrhea is one of the most commonly reported symptoms by adolescent girls and adult women in obstetrics and gynaecology departments that can have adverse effects on their quality of life. The aim of this research was to evaluate psychologic risk factors of primary dysmenorrhea.

Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted on female students residing in dormitory in Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences in Shahrekord, Iran. In this study, 96 females with dysmenorrhea and 100 females without dysmenorrhea were enrolled. A questionnaire along with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) was provided to the students.

Results
66 students had a PSS score >20 while 130 had a score â‰¤20. An association was established between high stress levels (PSS >20) and menstrual irregularity. No association was found in students with PSS >20 with hypomenorrhoea, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, long cycle length and short cycle length.

Conclusion
High stress levels (PSS >20) was associated with only menstrual irregularities and not with duration, amount of flow or dysmenorrhea. Hence, other causes should be looked for in young women complaining of menstrual problems before stress is assumed to be the cause.
