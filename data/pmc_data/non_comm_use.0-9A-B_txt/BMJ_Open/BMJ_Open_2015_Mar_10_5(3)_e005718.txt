Ploughman M, Beaulieu S, Harris C, et al. The Canadian survey of health, lifestyle and ageing with multiple sclerosis: methodology and initial results. BMJ Open 2014;4:e005718.

In the ‘Results’ section of the Abstract it states that ‘Older people with MS were less likely to engage in regular physical activity (26.7%) compared with typical older Canadians (45.2%). However, they were more likely to abstain from alcohol and smoking.’ This is incorrect and should read the same as within the article text and tables—that is, ‘Older people with MS were more likely to engage in regular physical activity (69.4%) compared with typical older Canadians (45.3%). They were also more likely to abstain from alcohol and smoking.’
