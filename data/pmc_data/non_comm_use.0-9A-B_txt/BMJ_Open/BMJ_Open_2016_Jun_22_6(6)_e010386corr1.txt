Kaczmarek MC, Ware RS, McEniery JA, et al. Epidemiology of pertussis related paediatric intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in Australia, 1997–2013: an observational study. BMJ Open 2016;6:e010386.

The penultimate sentence in the results section currently reads: ‘As a percentage of all influenza-related ICU admissions, deaths were highest in 1997–2000 (10.6%, n=5) and 2001–2004 (12.1%, n=8).’ Instead, the final sentence should be: ‘As a percentage of all pertussis-related ICU admissions, deaths were highest in 1997–2000 (10.6%, n=5) and 2001–2004 (12.1%, n=8).’
