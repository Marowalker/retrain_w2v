To determine the frequency of various types of improper cause-of-death (COD)
statements reported on death certificates and whether the frequency differed by
specialty of the certifying physician.

Design
Cross-sectional descriptive study.

Setting
2 medical centres in Tainan, Taiwan.

Participants
A total of 2520 death certificates issued by 230 physicians.

Main outcome measures
4 types of improper COD statements based on the criteria of correctness of the COD
causal sequence and the level of specificity of underlying COD selected.

Results
Of 2520 death certificates analysed, 502 (19.9%) had at least one type of improper
COD statement. However, only 235 (9.3%) sustained major errors, that is, 91 (3.6%)
reported incorrect causal sequence and 144 (5.7%) reported only mechanism(s) of
death (such as respiratory failure, heart failure, sepsis and acidosis). The
improper reporting rate was highest among nephrologists (53%, 24/45), followed by
infectious diseases physicians (45%, 29/65) and was lowest among oncologists (6%,
57/995).

Conclusions
About one-fifth issued death certificates sustained improper COD statements and
only one-tenth had noteworthy errors that would threaten the quality of COD
statistics. The frequency varied by specialty of the certifying physician because
physicians in different specialties manage different types of diseases and
conditions with contrasting complexities in terms of determining the causal
sequence and specificity of COD statements.

Article summary
Article focus
What is the frequency of various types of improper COD statements reported by
certifying physician in medical centre?

Do the frequencies of improper COD statements differ by specialty of the
certifying physician?

Key messages
One-fifth of issued death certificates sustained at least one type of improper
COD statements.

However, only one-tenth had noteworthy errors that would threaten the quality
of COD statistics.

The improper reporting rate varied by specialty of certifying physician and was
highest among nephrologists and infectious diseases physicians and lowest among
oncologists.

Strengths and limitations of this study
Compared with previous similar hospital-based studies, this study has the
largest sample size, which allowed us to stratify the improper rate by
subspecialties.

The case-mix and physicians' certification behaviours in the studied
hospitals might differ from other hospitals.
==== Body
Introduction
Recording cause-of-death (COD) statements on the death certificate is a common practice
of medical physicians. Good quality COD statement is prerequisite for good quality COD
statistics. Good quality COD statistics are cornerstones for good quality health policy
making and medical researches. The tabulation of COD statistics are based on the
underlying COD, which has been defined as (1) the disease or injury that initiated the
train of morbid events leading directly to death or (2) the circumstances of the
accident or violence which produced the fatal injury (see WHO,1 page 23). This definition is from the standpoint of prevention of
death; it is necessary to break the chain of events or to affect a cure at some point,
and the most effective public objective is to prevent the precipitating cause from
operating.

To facilitate the selection of the underlying COD when two or more COD are recorded, an
international standard form of death certificate (figure
1) has been designed and recommended by the WHO1 (see pages 23 and 24). Part I of the form is for diseases related to the
train of events leading directly to death, and part II is for unrelated but contributory
conditions. It is the responsibility of the medical practitioner signing the death
certificate to indicate which morbid conditions led directly to death and to state any
antecedent conditions giving rise to this cause.

Figure 1 International form of medical certificate of cause of death recommended by the
WHO.

However, on some occasions, certifying physicians might not report correct causal
sequence between diseases or conditions on line a, b, c or d (see examples 10–12
in table 1), the Selection Rules set by the
WHO1 (see pages 25–36) should be used to
standardise the process in selection of the underlying COD. Sometimes, the selected
underlying COD might not the real intent underlying COD of certifying physician and the
derived COS statistics might be biased. Furthermore, if certifying physicians do not
provide specific information on the death certificate, it is difficult to provide useful
information for the prevention of death.

Different classification schemes were used in previous studies to identify different
types of improper COD statements (appendix
1).2–14 Reporting incorrect COD causal sequence and reporting only
mechanism(s) of death are two major errors indicated in every study. Despite many
studies demonstrating various types of improper COD statements on death certificates,
very few studies have examined the frequency of improper COD statements by specialty of
the certifying physician. Information on which specialties have a higher percentage of
recording improper COD statements could help to target physicians with a high priority
for education and training in how to properly complete COD statements. There were two
objectives in this study: (1) to determine the frequencies of various types of improper
COD statements on death certificates reported by certifying physicians in two medical
centres in Tainan, Taiwan, and (2) to examine whether the frequency of improper
reporting differed by specialty of the certifying physician.

Methods
Setting and data source
This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Tainan, a major city located
in southern Taiwan with a population of 1.87 million. There are only two medical
centres in Tainan. In 2009, there were 1150 beds in the Chi-Mei Medical Center and
1100 beds in the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. We retrospectively reviewed
all death certificates issued from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 in these two
medical centres.

Determination of improper COD statements
We used two criteria—correctness of the COD causal sequence and level of
specificity—to define four types of improper COD statements. Examples of
proper and four types of improper COD statements are illustrated in table 1. Determination of the correctness of
the COD causal sequence is according to Decision Table D in the
Instruction Manual Part 2c compiled by the US National Center for
Health Statistics, which includes all acceptable causal sequences between diseases or
morbid conditions.15


Level of specificity was classified as specific COD, unspecific COD and mechanism of
death. Specific COD is defined as providing specific information on the aetiology and
body region, such as lung cancer, oesophageal varices bleeding, hepatitis B
infection, cerebrovascular infarction. Unspecific COD denotes those providing
unspecific information on aetiology (stroke without specifying whether it is due to
infraction or haemorrhage, tumour without specifying whether is benign or malignant
and aspiration pneumonia without specifying whether it is milk or water or other
foods) or on body region (gastrointestinal bleeding without specifying whether the
bleeding occurred in the oesophagus, stomach, intestine or colon). Mechanism of death
is defined as a physiological derangement or a biochemical disturbance produced by a
COD, such as congestive heart failure, respiratory failure, various arrhythmias,
bacteraemia, sepsis, acidosis. The mechanism of death does not provide
aetiology-specific information and therefore should not be the underlying COD.16
17


Proper COD statements include one correct causal sequence and one specific COD
reported on the lowest used line (see examples 1–3 in table 1). Type 1 improper COD statements comprise one correct
causal sequence and one unspecific COD reported on the lowest used line (see examples
4–6 in table 1). Liver tumour (see
example 4 in table 1) without specifying
whether malignant or benign and stroke (see example 5 in table 1) without specifying whether it was infarction or
haemorrhage. We also included cases in which mechanisms of death (eg, renal failure,
sepsis, heart failure) were reported on the line below some specific COD (eg,
cerebral infarction or acute myocardial infarction) in type 1 improper COD statements
(see example 6 in table 1). For example, the
true causal sequence might be cerebral infarction resulted in renal failure in
example 6 in table 1; however, the reported
causal sequence (renal failure resulted in cerebral infarction) is also acceptable
according to Decision Table D in the Instruction Manual Part
2c.15 Therefore, the underlying
COD selected would be the mechanism of death (ie, renal failure in example 6). In
this situation, renal failure was less specific than cerebral infarction and were
less useful from the point of view of disease prevention.

Type 3 improper COD statements contain two or more correct causal sequences (see
examples 10–12 in table 1). In other
words, there were more than one diseases or conditions reported on one line.
According to the Selection Rules, the first-mentioned COD will be selected as the
underlying COD, that is, diabetes in example 10, lung cancer in example 11 and sepsis
in example 12. However, the intended underlying COD of the certifying physician might
not be the first-mentioned COD.

Type 3 improper COD statements comprise one incorrect causal sequence reported (see
examples 13–15 in table 1). There
were some specific COD (ischaemic heart disease in example 13, diabetes mellitus in
example 14 and prostate cancer in example 15) incorrectly reported on the line below
another specific COD (obstructive lung disease in example 13, lung cancer in example
14 and liver cancer in example 15). Because the specific COD on the lower line could
not result in the specific COD on the upper line, therefore, the specific COD on the
upper line will be selected as the underlying COD according to the Selection Rules.
However, the intended underlying COD of the certifying physician might be the
specific COD on the lower line.

Type 4 improper COD statements involve only mechanism(s) of death being reported (see
examples 16–18 in table 1). This is
the most serious error because mechanism of death could not provide
aetiology-specific information for disease prevention.

Authors T-JC and T-HL reviewed all the death certificates to determine whether the
COD statement was acceptable or sustained one of the five types of error. T-JC is a
senior neurologist and T-HL is a senior family physician and both are in charge of
teaching in how to correctly report COD statements on the death certificate for
residents in the two medical centres.

Data analysis
We first calculated the frequencies of the four types of improper COD statements
among the death certificates analysed. We then computed the improper rate (containing
at least one type of improper COD statement) and the major error rate (type 3 and
type 4 improper COD statements combined) by specialty of the certifying physician. We
classified 19 subspecialties in this study.

Results
In 2009, a total of 2520 death certificates were issued by 230 physicians in two medical
centres in Tainan, Taiwan. There were 502 death certificates that sustained at least one
type of improper COD statement, with an overall improper statement rate of 20%
(502/2520). However, only one-tenth (235/2520) had major errors, that is, 91 (3.6%)
reported incorrect causal sequence and 144 (5.7%) reported only mechanism(s) of death
(table 2).

6% (57/995) among oncologists (table 3). Major
errors (type 3 and type 4 combined) were highest among nephrologists (27%, 12/45),
followed by cardiologists (25%, 31/125).

Discussion
Main findings
The findings of this study indicate that about one-fifth of death certificates
sustained at least one type of improper COD statement. However, only one-tenth had
major errors that would have noteworthy threat on the quality of COD statistics. The
improper rate varied by specialty of the certifying physician and was highest among
nephrologists and infectious disease physicians and lowest among oncologists.

Interpretations in relation to previous studies
Previous studies have presented different distributions of various types of improper
COD statements. The most common error was found to be the reporting of an unspecific
COD in four studies,5–7
9 the reporting of an incorrect COD causal
sequence in two studies4
12 and the reporting of mechanism(s) of death
only in one study.13 One of the explanations
of the above-mentioned variations are the differences in case-mix encountered in
different medical settings. Another explanation is that certifying physicians in
different medical settings have different COD certification behaviour patterns.

Consistent with previous Taiwanese study, unspecific COD statements were the most
common improper COD statement.6 The major error
rate was 9% in this hospital-based study, which was similar with previous national
study in Taiwan (11%). One possible explanation of lower major error rate in this
study was that there were more patients with cancer in two medical centres in this
study in which the determination of underlying COD was more straightforward.

Despite many studies having examined improper COD statements, few have assessed the
improper rate by specialty of the certifying physician. One Canadian study indicated
that the overall and major error rates were 61% and 40% in medicine, 65% and 35% in
surgery, 50% and 17% in oncology, 27% and 15% in family medicine, 38% and 30% in
paediatrics, and 56% and 22% in the critical care trauma unit, respectively.4 Unfortunately, because of the small sample size,
they did not further analyse the error rates by subspecialties. Consistent with the
results of that study, the oncologists in this study had the lowest major error rate.
Nevertheless, very few family physicians issue death certificates in medical centres
in Taiwan.

Physicians of different specialties manage different types of diseases and conditions
with contrasting complexities in terms of the determination of the underlying COD.
For example, most patients treated by oncologists have cancer, and the determination
of the underlying COD is comparably straightforward. Oncologists, who issued largest
amount of death certificates; nevertheless, had the lowest improper rate (9% in this
study) compared with their counterparts specialists. On the contrary, physicians in
department of nephrology, infectious diseases, critical care, cardiology and
respiratory medicine work mostly with patients with diseases or conditions lacking a
specific aetiology, such as renal failure, sepsis, heart failure, respiratory failure
and/or thus sustained a higher error rate in the COD statements.

As indicated by Kircher and Anderson,16 most
physicians tend to confuse cause and mechanism because medical therapy often attempts
to modify or ameliorate mechanisms rather than causes. For example, digoxin is often
highly effective in ameliorating the symptoms of congestive heart failure (mechanism)
but does nothing to modify the underlying coronary artery disease (cause). It is
rather difficult for physicians of infectious diseases, respiratory medicine or
nephrology to specify the etiological causes of sepsis, respiratory failure and renal
failure.

There were some debates on whether to define pneumonia as a specific COD (see example
3 in table 1). Ideally, the certifying
physician should specify whether the pneumonia was due to which type of virus,
bacteria or other aetiologies. However, in reality, it was very difficult to get
relevant information. Furthermore, pneumonia is a common final pathway to death,
which in most occasions was not suitable as the underlying COD. According to
Decision Table D in the Instruction Manual Part
2c, all diseases or conditions could result in pneumonia, similar to
other mechanisms of death (such as sepsis, respiratory failure, acidosis).15


In the revision of International Selection Rule 3 in the Second Edition of
the Instruction Manual of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
Revision (ICD-10) set by the WHO, which denotes that ‘any
pneumonia in ICD-10 code J12-J18 should be considered an obvious consequence of
conditions that impair the immune system. Pneumonia in ICD-10 code J18.0 and
J18.2-J18.9 should be considered an obvious consequence of wasting diseases (such as
malignant neoplasm and malnutrition) and diseases causing paralysis (such as cerebral
haemorrhage or thrombosis), as well as serious respiratory conditions, communicable
diseases and serious injuries. Pneumonia in ICD-10 code J18.0 and J18.2-J18.9, J69.0
and J69.8 should also be considered an obvious consequence of conditions that affect
the process of swallowing’ (see WHO,1
page 29).

Implications of this study
As there were one-tenth of death certificates analysed had major errors, that is,
reported incorrect causal sequence and only mechanism(s) of death. Further studies
are needed to retrospectively review the medical records for those death certificates
to identify the real underlying COD and to estimate the possible effects on the
estimation of cause-specific mortality rates.

With regard to intervention, a review study of educational interventions targeted at
improving the quality of COD certification suggested that printed educational
material alone is the intervention with the least educational impact and interactive
workshops are the most effective intervention.18


Another way to improve the quality of COD statistics is to query the certifier who
reported vague or incomplete information on the death certificate for clarification.
A study in the USA suggested that 51 of the 52 registration areas queried either
demographic or COD information, and almost 90% of queries were returned. The
underlying COD changed in approximately 68% of these cases.19 The Bureau of Health of Tainan city could query death
certificates in which only the mechanism of death is reported to obtain more specific
information to improve the quality of COD statistics.

Strengths and limitations
Compared with previous similar hospital-based studies, this study has the largest
sample size, which allowed us to stratify the improper rates by subspecialties. This
study used very detailed classification of types of improper COD statements, which
could provide very practical information for the design of materials for medical
education.

One of the limitations of this study was that we analysed only the death certificates
issued in two medical centres, and the case-mix and physicians' certification
behaviours in the two medical centres studied might differ from those in other
hospitals. Another limitation was that we were unable to differentiate whether COD
statements were reported by junior residents or senior attending physicians because
of the co-signature system used in the two medical centres studied. The four types of
improper COD statements were by no means complete but were by far the most complete
classification as compared with previous studies.

Conclusions
In conclusion, about one-fifth of death certificates sustained at least one type of
improper COD statement. However, only one-tenth had major errors that would have
noteworthy threat on the quality of COD statistics. The frequencies of improper COD
statements varied greatly by specialty of the certifying physician because physicians
with different specialties manage different types of diseases and conditions with
contrasting complexities in terms of the determination of a specific COD. Educational
intervention and queries should target specialties with a high frequency of improper COD
statements.
