Orkin J, Chan CY, Fayed N, et al. Complex care for kids Ontario: protocol for a mixed-methods randomised controlled trial of a population-level care coordination initiative for children with medical complexity. BMJ Open 2019;9:e028121. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028121.

This article was previously published with errors in data.

In the ‘Primary outcome’ section, there’s a typo: it says “as they hadve content relation to:”; it should instead read “as they have content relation to:”

In the ‘Sample size’ section,

The last sentence in the first paragraph is missing the second part. It should read: ‘projected smallest clinically important difference of 0.5 of the within-patient SD, which is recommended by the developer as a moderate effect size.'

The second paragraph should start with ‘The required sample size is considered feasible as it is estimated that a pool of about 250 patients are readily identifiable for recruitment at CCKO sites.’
