Benfer KA, Weir KA, Bell KL, et al. Longitudinal cohort protocol study
of oropharyngeal dysphagia: relationships to gross motor attainment, growth and
nutritional status in preschool children with cerebral palsy. BMJ Open
2012;2:e001460. A number of
author corrections were inadvertently missed during the proofing stage:

1. The title of this paper should read: ‘Protocol for a longitudinal cohort study
of oropharyngeal dysphagia: relationships to gross motor attainment, growth and
nutritional status in preschool children with cerebral palsy.’

2. Under the section “Aims and hypotheses” the expansion of DDS is
actually “Dysphagia Disorders Survey” (not “Schedule”).

3. Under the section “Thomas-Stonell & Greenburg Scale—saliva
control”, paragraph 2, reference 53 should be after “Scale” (as
this is part of the measure name).

4. Table 2: H2(A) –These are all the same hypothesis, so all instances should
have been in upper case A.

We apologise for these errors.
