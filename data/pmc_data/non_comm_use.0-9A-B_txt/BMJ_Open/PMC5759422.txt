Much of early medical and nursing practice was based on nonscientific traditions that resulted in variable and haphazard patient outcomes. These traditions and rituals, which were based on folklore, gut instinct, trial and error, and personal preference, were often passed down from one generation of practitioner to another. It has become essential for practitioners to use the best data available to make patient care decisions and carry out the scientific and evidence-based interventions. The aim of this study is suggestion of a framework for easily translation of evidence-based knowledge into clinical practice.

Methods
This discussion paper explains the process that evidence-based knowledge is created from crude scientific knowledge, disseminated among stakeholders, implemented into clinical practice and ultimately evaluated. In May 2014, the primary author searched electronic and scientific databases without limiting searches by publication date, to find applicable literature.

Results
This framework presented how evidence-based knowledge can be created and distributed among stakeholders to implement into practice. Additionally, this framework explains interactions between stakeholders, context, and evidence-based knowledge from acquirement to adherence. Knowledge can easily translate into clinical practice by step-by-step following of 4 phases consisted of knowledge creation, knowledge dissemination, knowledge implementation, evaluation and feedback.

Conclusion
Today, evidence based knowledge translation has become an imperative component for healthcare disciplines and identified as one of most important priorities of present millennium. Evidence-based knowledge translation is a simple and feasible way to bridging the gap between evidence-based knowledge and clinical practice that can be carry out trough utilization of current conceptual framework.
