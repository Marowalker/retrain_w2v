Ji C, Cappuccio FP. Socioeconomic inequality in salt intake in Britain 10 years after a national salt reduction programme. BMJ Open 2014;4:e005683. The authors have become aware that during the submission process the incorrect figure 2 was uploaded and subsequently published. The figure does not match the data reported in table 3, which is indeed correct and it is referred to for the results of the study and discussion. Whilst the mistake is uninfluential, the figure may be misleading for some. The amended figureÂ is below. The legend is unaffected.
