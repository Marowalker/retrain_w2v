Griffiths P, Ball J, Murrells T, et al. Registered nurse, health care support worker, medical staffing levels and mortality in English hospital Trusts: a cross-sectional study. BMJ Open 2016;5:e008751.

The correlations in the bottom half of table 2 of this paper are incorrect – the current version relates to the correlation RN per patient and HCSW per patient rather than Patients per RN and Patients per HCSW. There are no resulting changes to the text but the revised figures for 31 Trusts are:

RN-HCSW r=0.24, p=0.063

RN-Doctor r=0.55, p<0.001

HCSW-Doctor r=0.16, p=0.21
