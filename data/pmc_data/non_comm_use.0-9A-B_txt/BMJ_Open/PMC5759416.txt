Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common sexual transmitted infection worldwide among women and plays a key role in the development of genital cancers. Different studies in Iran, reported various prevalences and combining their results could be important for health policy makers. The aim of this study is to estimate the prevalence of HPV and its high risk genotypes among Iranian healthy women.

Methods
Using national and international databases and excluding duplicates and irrelevant evidences followed by applying exclusion criteria and quality assessment, eligible articles were selected. Standard error of the prevalence was calculated based on binomial distribution. Random effects model was used because of the high heterogeneity among the results.

Results
Of 14 studies entered into the systematic review, 24 evidences reported the HPV prevalence among 7655 healthy and non-cancerous women in different provinces of Iran. Total prevalence of HPV, 9.4% (95% CI: 6.8–12.02), HPV 16, 2.03% (95% CI: 1.3–2.8), HPV 18, 1.7% (95% CI: 0.9–2.5) and other genotypes of HPV, 5.3% (95% CI: 3.6–6.9) were estimated.

Conclusion
Our meta- analysis showed that the total prevalence of HPV and its high- risk genotypes (16 and 18) among healthy non- cancerous Iranian women was very high.
