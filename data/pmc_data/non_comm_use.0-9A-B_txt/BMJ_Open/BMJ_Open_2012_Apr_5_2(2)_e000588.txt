The aim of this study was to evaluate by meta-analysis the current level of
evidence in order to establish the impact of a platelet transfusion on
survival in patients on pre-injury antiplatelet agents who sustain an
intracranial haemorrhage (either spontaneous or traumatic).

Design
This was a meta-analysis; the MEDLINE Database was searched using the PubMed
interface and the Ovid interface. CINAHL and EMBASE Databases were also
searched. The search was performed to identify randomised controlled trials
(RCT)'s case-controlled studies or nested case-controlled studies.
Comparing the outcome (death or survival) of patients with intracranial
haemorrhage (ICH) and pre-injury antiplatelet agents who received a platelet
transfusion against a similar cohort of patients who did not receive a
platelet transfusion.

Results
499 citations were obtained from the PubMed search. 31 full articles were
reviewed from 34 abstracts. 6 studies were found suitable for the
meta-analysis. No randomised controlled studies were identified. 2 of the
six studies were in patients with spontaneous ICH. The remaining four
studies were in patients with traumatic intracranial haemorrhage.
Significant heterogeneity was present between the studies,
I2=58.276. The random effects model was therefore the
preferred model, this produced a pooled OR for survival of 0.773 (95% CI
0.414 to 1.442).

Conclusions
The results of this meta-analysis has shown, based upon six small studies,
that there was no clear benefit in terms of survival in the administration
of a platelet transfusion to patients with antiplatelet-associated ICH.
Further work is required in order to establish any potential benefit in the
administration of a platelet transfusion in patients with spontaneous or
traumatic intracranial haemorrhage who were on pre-injury antiplatelet
agents.

Article summary
Article focus
The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the impact on survival of a
platelet transfusion in patients on pre-injury antiplatelet agents with:

Traumatic intracranial haemorrhage following blunt head trauma.

Spontaneous ICH.

Key messages
Six studies were found to be suitable for the meta-analysis (two studies
for spontaneous ICH and the remaining four were traumatic intracranial
haemorrhage).

The pooled OR showed no benefit in survival following a platelet
transfusion (OR=0.773, 95% CI 0.414 to 1.442).

Strengths and limitations of this study
The studies were small, unpowered and not randomised.

Mortality is a relatively crude marker of effect in the cohort of
patients with either spontaneous or traumatic haemorrhage.

Significant bias may have been introduced in view of the fact that in all
but one study, the platelet transfusions were given at the discretion of
the attending physician.
==== Body
Introduction
Antiplatelet agents, in particular aspirin and clopidogrel, are an essential
component of treatment and prophylaxis for both cardiovascular disease and
cerebrovasular; however, they are both associated with a small risk of intracranial
haemorrhage (ICH). He et al1
performed a meta-analysis of 16 clinical trials and showed that aspirin treatment
was associated with an absolute risk increase of haemorrhagic stroke of 12 events
per 10 000 persons (95% CI 5 to 20, p<0.001). With regard to traumatic
intracranial haemorrhage (TICH), early studies in this field (Mack et
al2, Spektor et
al3, Jones et
al4) failed to demonstrate
antiplatelet agents as a risk factor for ICH in patients with blunt head trauma.
Fabbri et al5 undertook a
cohort study looking at predictors for ICH on a database of 14 288 head
injury patients. These authors found using multivariate logistic regression that the
combination of age over 65 years and the use of antiplatelet agents
statistically increased the risk of ICH in their model. Pre-injury use of
antiplatelet agents alone was found to have an OR of 1.2 (95% CI 0.9 to 1.7,
p=0.202). Thus, it may well be that the combination of increased age plus use
of antiplatelet agents rather than antiplatelet agents in isolation increases the
risk of TICH as suggested by Fabbri et al.5

McMillan and Rogers6 proposed a protocol for
the administration of a platelet transfusion in patients with TICH who were on
pre-injury antiplatelet agents. The authors, however admit, in their own review that
the evidence for this approach is lacking. A systematic review by Beshay et
al7 provided an overview of the
pharmacology of antiplatelet agents in the setting of intracranial haemorrhage.
Cambell et al8 also provided
a protocol for correcting platelet dysfunction in antiplatelet-associated ICH. These
authors also recognised that the current evidence for this approach is limited. The
administration of platelet transfusions is practiced in some trauma centres for
traumatic antiplatelet-associated ICH. The aim of this study was to evaluate by
meta-analysis the current level of evidence in order to establish the impact of a
platelet transfusion on survival in patients on pre-injury antiplatelet agents who
sustain an intracranial haemorrhage (either spontaneous or traumatic).

Methods
The MEDLINE Database was searched using the PubMed interface. The following search
terms were used: (1) Head injury AND antiplatelet agents. (2)
Intracranial haemorrhage AND platelet transfusion.
Case–control and nested case–control studies comparing the cohort who
were given platelet transfusions against the cohort who had not were included in the
meta-analysis. The search strategy was run several times during the development of
the paper in order to ensure that all the relevant papers were captured up to the
date of submission. The final PubMed search was performed on 30 November 2011. The
Athens website was also used to search the UK MEDLINE Database, EMBASE and CINAHL
Databases. The search was performed on 30 November. A full review of the search
strategy is provided in online appendix 1. No limits were placed on the search using
either the PubMed portal or the Athens portal with regard to year range, age range
or language. Third, a search for randomised controlled trials was performed using
the Cochrane Database. A full review of the search strategy is provided in online
appendix 1.

Selection criteria were broadly based upon MOOSE,9 methodology. Inclusion criteria were (1) randomised controlled trials
comparing patients with aspirin-related ICH (spontaneous or traumatic) who were
treated with a platelet transfusion compared with those with aspirin-related ICH who
were not treated with a platelet transfusion. (2) Case–control studies
comparing mortality rates of adult head injury patients on antiplatelet agents (with
ICH) who received a platelet transfusion versus mortality rates of adult head injury
patients on antiplatelet agents (with ICH) who did not receive a platelet
transfusion. No lower limit was placed on the size of the study groups in either the
case–control or nested case–control studies. (3) Cohort studies with a
nested case–control group comparing mortality rates of adult head injury
patients on antiplatelet agents (with ICH) who received a platelet transfusion
versus mortality rates of adult head injury patients on antiplatelet agents (with
ICH) who did not receive a platelet transfusion. (4) Case–control studies or
nested case–control studies comparing mortality rates of adult patients on
antiplatelet agents with spontaneous ICH who received a platelet transfusion versus
mortality rates of adult patients on antiplatelet agents with spontaneous ICH who
did not receive a platelet transfusion. No lower limit was placed on the size of the
study groups in either the case–control or nested case–control
studies. Appraisal of the abstract titles for relevance was made by JSB and AG. All
full papers were reviewed by JSB and AG.

Articles were eligible for inclusion from any language provided that they were
published in peer-reviewed journals. Exclusion criteria: (1) case–control or
cohort studies where patient transfusion was used to correct a generalised
coagulopathy. (2) Case–control or nested case–control studies in
patients with ICH from thrombocytopaenia. All the abstracts and full papers reviewed
were in English language and therefore problems with translation were not
encountered. Conference proceedings were not included in the search strategy nor was
a search for unpublished data performed. Contact was not made with authors of any of
the studies, and the data were extracted directly either from the abstract or the
full text.

Statistical analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta-analysis V.2 (http://meta-analysis.com;
Biostat Inc.). Forest plots were produced for the studies with respect to mortality.
Heterogeneity between studies was performed using the I2 test.

Results
Six studies were identified which were found to be suitable for the meta-analysis.
Two studies were case-controlled studies in patients with spontaneous ICH and the
remaining four studies were in patients with TICH. No completed randomised
controlled trials were identified. The inclusion and exclusion PRISMA flow diagram
is shown in figure 1. A more detailed summary
of the results of the search strategy is shown in online appendix 1.

Characteristics of included studies
Washington and colleagues10 from Missouri
retrospectively reviewed 1101 patients presenting to their level one trauma
centre over a 2-year period with minor traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS) ≥13). Of these, 321 had TICH and 113 (35.2%) were on
pre-injury antiplatelet agents. The two groups were similar at baseline in terms
of age and presenting GCS. Primary outcome measures were neurological decline,
Glasgow Outcome Scale, surgical intervention and mortality. Platelet transfusion
was given according to physician discretion, introducing a risk of bias. The
transfused group had a higher Marshall score, reflecting a larger haematoma
volume (20.6±26.5 vs 8.2±13.7; p=0.02), at presentation.
There were significantly more patients in the transfused group taking
clopidogrel compared with the non-transfused group (52% vs 20%,
p=0.0005). They found no statistically significant difference in outcome
between the groups; they did find a trend towards significance for medical
decline (defined a priori as an increase in the delivered level of monitoring or
intervention because of cardiac, pulmonary or renal decline). Mortality rates
were not significant between the two groups (2/44 (5%) vs 0/64 (0%)). They did,
however, find that of all the TBI patients included, any patient receiving a
transfusion (n=65, 20%) had a significantly higher mortality (6% vs 0%,
p<0.0001) and OR of medical decline (5.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 28.2).

The study by Ducruet et al11 was a retrospective cohort study of 66 patients admitted to a
neurological ICU with a primary ICH while on antiplatelet agents. One hundred
five of the 121 patients were on aspirin alone and 11 of the 121 patients were
taking aspirin and clopidogrel. Of the remaining five patients, two were on
dipyridamole and the final three not specified. Of these, 35 (53.8%) received a
platelet transfusion. The primary outcome measure was to detect a 25% difference
in haematoma expansion from the CT on admission between the platelet-transfused
group and the non-transfused group. Other outcome parameters were the modified
Rankin Score on discharge, mortality rate and the rate of systemic
complications. The indications for giving a platelet transfusion were not
available to the investigators, although the assumption was that a platelet
transfusion was given at the discretion of the attending physician. This may
introduce an element of bias into the study and is to the detriment of the
paper. The groups were well matched with regard to age (p=0.597) and mean
GCS (p=0.992). The mortality rate in the treatment group was half than
that in the non-treatment group; however, due to the small numbers (2/35 (5.7%)
vs 4/31 (12.9%)), the result did not reach statistical significance. They also
noted no statistical significance in either initial or final haematoma volume
(initial volume (ml) 30.9±28.3 vs 27.7±25.4, p=0.63; final
volume 33.9±32.6 vs 33.1±30.8, p=0.92), length of stay or
discharge modified Rankin score (4.1±1.3 vs 4.5±0.9). The study
did suggest a trend towards increased mortality (23.1% vs 6.1%, p=0.10)
and haematoma expansion (35.7% vs 11.8%, p=0.034) in patients taking
clopidogrel rather than those taking aspirin alone.

The Creutzfeldt study12 was a
single-centre retrospective study of 368 consecutive patients with spontaneous
ICH over 2 years admitted to a primary stroke centre. Of these, 121
(31.3%) were taking antiplatelet agents (aspirin 105, clopidogrel 3, aspirin
+ clopidogrel 11, aspirin + dipyridamole 2). The primary outcome
measure was hospital death. Secondary outcome measure was favourable outcome.
This study was again well matched for age (70 vs 71, p=0.65); however,
median GCS (13 (9–15) vs 11 (6.5–14), p=0.1) was lower at
presentation, suggesting that some of the group not receiving a platelet
transfusion were deemed unsalvageable and palliation was the preferred treatment
pathway, as reflected by the increased Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order
frequency (34% vs 44%). The indications for using a platelet transfusion were
also not available to the investigating authors, and again, it must be assumed
that this was given at the discretion of the attending physician with the
caveats described above. The mortality rate in the control group (38%) was quite
high in comparison to the other studies. In the intervention group all 14
patients died, withdrawl of tretament was performed presumably due to futility
of continuing active management. Due to the small size of the study, the
difference in the mortality rate between the study group and the control group
did reach statistical significance (p=0.17).

The study by Downey et al13 was a retrospective review over 4 years in two level 1
trauma centres. They identified 328 patients over 50 with TBI on pre-injury
antiplatelet therapy of whom 166 (50.6%) received platelet transfusion. Primary
outcome measure was mortality. Secondary outcome measure was length of hospital
stay. The two groups were well matched with respect to the presenting GCS
(p=0.96) but not with respect to age. Patients who received a platelet
transfusion were older than the control group (p=0.001). This may reflect
the increased prevalence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in a more
elderly population. Thirty-one patients received a platelet transfusion at the
discretion of the attending surgeon at one centre. At the second study centre,
135 patients received a platelet transfusion as part of a routine procedure if
the Platelet Function Analyzer (PFA)-100 screening test showed evidence of
platelet dysfunction. There was little difference in mortality between the
treatment group and the control group (17.5% vs 16.7%). Additional confounders
include the higher rates of both warfarin use (89% vs 80%, p=0.038) and
clopidogrel use (45% vs 14%, p<0.001). Unfortunately, the data as
described do not allow separation of these two groups. The warfarin group had an
increased mortality (27.5% vs 15.2%, p=0.032) and the clopidogrel group
did not (15.5% vs 17.7%, p=0.62), which contradicts the findings of the
later study by Creutzfeldt et al.12

The Ivascu study14 was a retrospective
review of a trauma registry over a 5-year period of patients with ICH who were
taking pre-injury antiplatelet agents. In total, 109 patients were identified:
61 patients were on aspirin, 17 patients were on clopidogrel and 31 patients
were on both. Of these 109 patients, 40 (36.7%) were given a platelet
transfusion, again at the discretion of the attending physician. The primary
outcome measure was mortality. The cohort of patients in this study were
reasonably well matched with regard to age (p=0.593) and presenting GCS
(p=0.332). The Injury Severity Score was slightly higher in the
transfusion group than in the control group (23.4±9.8 vs 20.3±6.7,
p=0.183). This may be the explanation for the sizeable difference in the
mortality between the two groups with the higher mortality being in the
transfusion group (27.5% vs 13.0%, p=0.064), as may also explain the
increased proportion in the transfusion group operated upon compared with the
non-transfused group (9/40 (22.5%) vs 8/69 (11.5%)), p=0.137).

The Fortuna study15 was a retrospective
review of patients with TBI aged over 50 years in a single, tertiary,
level 1 trauma centre. They identified 521 patients fitting these criteria but
acknowledge that they did exclude patients in whom the medical records were
incomplete. Of the 521 patients, 166 were taking pre-injury antiplatelet and
anticoagulant therapy. One hundred and twenty-six patients were taking
antiplatelet agents (17 clopidogrel, 91 aspirin and 18 were taking both).
Twenty-nine patients were taking warfarin and 11 patients ‘other’
unspecified medication. Sixty-six (39.8%) of these 166 patients received a
platelet transfusion during their stay. Patients receiving a platelet
transfusion were older (73±2 vs 69±1, p=0.02), had a lower
initial GCS (11±1 vs 13±0.2, p=0.004), a higher initial
Injury Severity Score (ISS) (28±1 vs 24±1, p=0.001) and a
longer length of stay (12±2 vs 7±0.4 days, p=0.007);
all these may have contributed to the higher mortality (20/66, 30.3%) compared
with those in the group which did not receive a platelet transfusion (16/100,
16%). As with many of the preceding papers, the platelets were given at the
discretion of the attending physician.

Meta-analysis data
Forest plots were produced for the mortality rates in the intervention
(transfusion) and control groups (figure
2). Separate Forest plots were produced for traumatic and spontaneous
ICH. These are included as figures 3 and
4. Significant heterogeneity was
present between the six studies, I2=58.276; therefore, the
random effects model was the preferred model and this produced a pooled OR for
survival of 0.773 (95% CI 0.414 to 1.442). The fixed effects model was also
evaluated and this was found to produce a similar results (common OR for
survival: 0.798, 95% CI 0.559 to 1.139). The fixed effect model for the
spontaneous-only group produced a pooled OR of 1.825 (95% CI 0.892 to 3.744).
The fixed effect model for the trauma-only group produced a pooled OR of 0.609
(95% CI 0.404 to 0.917).

Discussion
Six studies were identified for the meta-analysis, two studies evaluating patients
with spontaneous ICH and four with TICH. Combining the data from all studies, there
was no evidence of benefit, with a trend towards decreased survival in patients
selected for a platelet transfusion. All six studies were relatively small in size,
this combined with the difference in pathophysiology of traumatic ICH and
spontaneous ICH makes any clear conclusions prohibitive.

When the data for TICH are extracted separately, platelet transfusions appear to have
a negative effect on survival 0.609 (95% CI 0.404 to 0.917). The paper by Downey
et al13 had the greatest
weight in the meta-analysis data because of its greater numbers. The paper by Downey
et al13 was judged by
both authors to be the weakest due to differing protocols followed on either site
(treatment at physician discretion vs treatment according to platelet function). If
this paper is removed, the risk of survival from platelet transfusion decreases
further (OR 0.387, 95% CI 0.216 to 0.694); how much weight can be given to this due
to the reduction of patient numbers by 46% is unclear. The fact that platelet
transfusions were given at the discretion of the attending surgeon does add
significant bias into the meta-analysis. Although the studies were reasonably
controlled with respect to presenting GCS, other factors such as increased haematoma
volume or associated co-morbidity may have contributed to the worse outcome in the
platelet transfusion group rather than the platelet transfusion itself. There may be
a caveat for transfusing patients on antiplatelet agents who have sustained a
traumatic ICH, although further work is required in this area.

Conversely, patients with spontaneous ICH showed a trend towards benefit from
platelet transfusion (OR 1.825, 95% CI 0.892 to 3.734). This was despite the small
study numbers and allocation of patients at physician discretion, possibly
introducing a positive bias in terms of both severity and therefore presumed
survivability. With the assumption that patients considered more likely to survive
were more likely to be given a platelet transfusion and vice versa. A subgroup
analysis, Ducruet et al,11
also showed that in the subgroup of patients on clopidogrel, there was an increased
mortality and an increase in haematoma expansion.

With regard to spontaneous ICH, three important papers relevant to this subject need
to be discussed. Sansing et al16 undertook a retrospective cohort study on 282 patients with
spontaneous ICH, 70 patients were on antiplatelet medication. The authors found no
difference between the antiplatelet medication group and the no antiplatelet group
with regard to volume of ICH on CT, haematoma growth or outcome score. Naidech
et al17 performed a
cohort study on 68 patients with spontaneous ICH who were either on antiplatelet
agents or had laboratory evidence of reduced platelet function. A platelet
transfusion was administered in 16 patients at the discretion of the attending
physician. The authors found that there was no difference in the modified Rankin
Scale at 14 days, 28 days and 3 months between the transfused
group and the non-transfused group. Naidech et al18 published their findings from a prospective
cohort study on 45 patients with spontaneous ICH and reduced platelet activity. The
cohort was divided into high risk for haemorrhage growth grade and non-high-risk
patients for haemorrhage growth. High-risk patients received a CT and platelet
transfusion within 12 h of symptom onset. Non-high-risk patients received a
CT and platelet transfusion after 12 h. The authors found that for the
high-risk group platelet transfusion within 12 h resulted in smaller
haemorrhage size and better outcome (modified Rankin Score) compared with the cohort
of patients who received a platelet transfusion after 12 h. Further work is
required in some of these areas, in particular to clarify the effect of pre-injury
antiplatelet agents on haematoma size and progression.

With regard to the traumatic ICH cohort, a relevant paper was published by Bachelani
et al.19 Theses authors
performed a nested case–control study comparing aspirin-associated TICH
against a control group of non-aspirin-associated ICH. The Aspirin Response Test
(ART; VerifyNow) was performed on all patients. Patients with an ART <550
received a platelet transfusion. Eleven patients in the non-aspirin control group
(n=48) had an ART evidence of platelet inhibition and consequently received a
platelet transfusion. Two patients in the aspirin group (n=36) had no ART
evidence of platelet inhibition and therefore did not receive a platelet
transfusion. The data were therefore not suitable for this meta-analysis. Bachelani
et al,19 however, found
no difference in mortality between the aspirin group and the non-aspirin group.

Conclusions
The small size of the six studies none of which were powered to demonstrate a
difference in survival clearly means that no firm conclusions can be drawn from this
meta-analysis. Except for the study by Downey et al,13 platelet transfusion in the remaining
studies were given at the discretion of the attending surgeon. The current low level
of evidence has prompted a multiple centre randomised control trial based in the
Netherlands, The PATCH study,20 in order to
address the potential efficacy of platelet transfusion in patients with
antiplatelet-associated ICH. The end points of the study are safety of platelet
transfusion and haematoma progression. Further work is clearly required on this
subject so that the efficacy of platelet transfusion in spontaneous or traumatic ICH
can be fully evaluated.
