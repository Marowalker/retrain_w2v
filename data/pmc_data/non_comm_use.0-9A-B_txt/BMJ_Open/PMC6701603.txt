Harnett JE, McIntyre E, Steel A, et al. Use of complementary medicine products: a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of 2019 Australian adults. BMJ Open 2019;9:e024198. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024198

This article was previously published with errors in data.

The error relates to a discrepancy between the reporting of a dollar amount in Table 2 and the text of the section ‘expense of each type of medicine use’.

Incorrect statement: ‘Extrapolation of this data to the Australian population indicates an annual spend of AUD$480 on CM products.’

Corrected statement: ‘Extrapolation of this data to the Australian population indicates an annual spend of AUD$2 959 901 478 on CM products.’

Table 2 does not require any revision. The incorrect $ amount is cited again in the discussion section:

‘The estimated annual expenditure on CM products by the adult Australian population in 2006 was A$1.86 billion,9 which is higher than the estimated expenditure of AUD$480 million identified from our data.’

The sentence below has been revised to contain the correct information for inclusion in the discussion:

‘The estimated annual expenditure on CM products by the adult Australian population in 2006 was A$1.86 billion,9 which is lower than the estimated expenditure of AUD$2.9 billion identified from our data.’
