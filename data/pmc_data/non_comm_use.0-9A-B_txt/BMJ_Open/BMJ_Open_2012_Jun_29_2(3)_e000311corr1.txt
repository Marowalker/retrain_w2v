==== Body
After review of the data it appears that the authors accidentally miscoded several points
in the data set, which have resulted in an error in the published article (
BMJ Open 2011;1:e000311. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000311). In the abstract the year used to retrieve age
standardised incidence and mortality rates was the 2008 and not 2007 dataset (the correct
year is mentioned in the methods section and in the references), and the number of
countries was 88 (as appears in the appendix) and not 87. The Pearson correlation between
prostate cancer incidence in nations' world-wide and oral contraceptive use was 0.58
and not 0.61. The Pearson correlation between prostate cancer incidence in Europe and oral
contraceptive use was 0.59 and not 0.55. Prostate cancer incidence correlated with condom
use in nations worldwide (r=0.48) but not in Europe or by continent. Figure 1A,B have been corrected. In the multivariable
mode the adjusted estimates for the association of oral contraceptive use with prostate
cancer incidence is 0.65 (95% CI 0.3 to 1.01), p=0.001 (not 1.06 (95% CI 0.58 to
1.6)). Table 1 has been corrected. The correlation
of prostate cancer mortality rates with oral contraceptive use was not statistically
significant (r=0.16, p=0.1 not 0.53, p<0.05). Figure 2 has been changed. With hindsight, after correcting the data
and the analysis, the title of the manuscript would have been less easily misinterpreted if
it had been: ‘Oral contraceptive use is associated with prostate cancer incidence:
an ecologic study’.
