Operating room is a quiet place and serious that there will be any extra noise to the distraction and interfere with verbal communication between people. However, numerous studies have shown that a significant relaxation in the operating room does not establish silence and may be used to achieve this purpose; the quiet sound of music. This study is a systematic review about the effects of music on the healing process of patients in the operating room.

Methods
We systematically reviewed the literature from Medline (PubMed), The Cochrane Library, Ovid, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest and Google Scholar published between 2000 and 2016. The search strategy included a combination of Mesh and Free Keywords, “Music”, “Music Therapy”, “Operating room”, “operating theatre”, “surgery room”, in all fields. Also the publication types of review and articles were included and meetings abstract, editorials, brief commentaries, letters, errata and papers that Subtopics were also excluded.

Results
Our initial search identified 480 abstracts. Application of the inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in 17 articles for review. Findings indicated that music has a positive effect on patient perception of anxiety, pain and satisfaction some times, but it was relatively ineffective when there is a severe pain. Also findings showed that loud music played in operating theatres hinders the ability of nurses to hear instructions. On the other hand surgeons speed increase with music played in operating theaters.

Discussion
Music is a free way to improve patients stress and pain before and during surgery. Although there isn't enough evidence in order to draw a net conclusion about the effect of music in operating rooms.
