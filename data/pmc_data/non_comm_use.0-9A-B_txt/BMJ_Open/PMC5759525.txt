Transition to motherhood is a stressful and challenging process in the postpartum period, so that mothers not only face with new maternal tasks but also with significant changes in their bodies. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of training packages on maternal self-confidence in the postpartum period.

Methods
This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 136 primiparous women who were referred to health centers in Tabriz, Iran, for their second postpartum care (10–15 days after delivery). Primiparous women aged 18–35 with singleton pregnancy and term birth (37–42 weeks) were randomly assigned to training (n=68) and control (n=68) groups. The education group was provided with a face to face training session, three phone sessions, and a booklet. The control group received the routine postpartum care in days 1–3, 10–15, and 42–60. Participants completed the Lips maternal self-confidence questionnaire before the intervention and eight weeks postpartum. ANCOVA with adjustments for baseline score was used for analysis.

Results
No statistically significant difference was found between the two groups in terms of socio-demographic characteristics except for infant's gender (p>0.05). At 6 weeks after the intervention and by adjusting for baseline scores, mean scores of maternal self-confidence (Adjusted mean difference: 16.6; CI 95%:13.8 to 19.3, p<0.001) in educational group were significantly higher than the control.

Conclusion
Results showed that training women have a positive effect in increasing their self-confidence.
