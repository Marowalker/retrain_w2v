There are several amendments to this article: Reference 23 should be Betts D. Acupressure techniques for use during childbirth and pregnancy. http://acupuncture.rhizome.net.nz (accessed 2015 2005).

The sentence: Acupressure,22 24 which uses six main points for use during labour selected from a previously published protocol.23 These focus on hormone release for labour progression, augmentation of contractions, pain relief, nausea and positioning of baby.

Should read: Acupressure, 22 24 which uses six main points for use during labour selected from a previously published protocol.23 The participants were given DVDs of the acupressure protocol23 to take home for practice. These focus on hormone release for labour progression, augmentation of contractions, pain relief, nausea and positioning of baby.

The sentence: The LAS contains 29 questions with a seven-point Likert scale ranging from ‘1=almost always’, to‘7=rarely’. Therefore, scores could theoretically range from 29, indicating the highest control possible, to a high score of 203 indicating the lowest agency possible.
