Greenwood N, Menzies-Gow E, Nilsson D, et al. Experiences of older people dying in nursing homes: a narrative systematic review of qualitative studies. BMJ Open 2018; 8(6):e021285. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-021285.

There is an error in the references. Reference number 17 is cited as:

Fleming J, Farquhar M, Brayne C, et al. Death and the oldest old: attitudes and preferences for end-of-life care--Qualitative research within a population-based cohort study. PLoS One 2016;11:e0150686. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0150686

However, the correct reference is:

Fleming J, Calloway R, Perrels A, et al. Dying comfortably in very old age with or without dementia in different care settings – a representative “older old” population study. BMC Geriatr 201717:222. doi:10.1186/s12877-017-0605-2
