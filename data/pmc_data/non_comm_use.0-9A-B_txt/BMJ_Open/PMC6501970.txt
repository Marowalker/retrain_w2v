Gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis has a poor outcome. Only a few studies have specifically investigated this group of patients. Japanese researchers have shown that chemotherapy with intraperitoneal paclitaxel (IPP) and oral S-1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) is active and well tolerated. These results have been achieved in a specific genetic pool (Japanese population), using regimens that may not be available in other parts of the world. We have designed this phase I trial to investigate IPP in combination with a standard chemotherapy combination in these patients.

Methods
We use a 3+3 expanded cohort dose escalation until a predefined number of dose-limiting toxicities are reached. Patients will have an intraperitoneal catheter placed surgically after trial enrolment. Chemotherapy includes a maximum of six cycles (21 days) of capecitabine (X) (1000 mg/m2 two times a day, days 1–14)+cisplatin (C) (intravenous 80 mg/m2 day 1) and IPP (days 1 and 8) with the following doses: cohort-1: 10 mg/m2, cohort-2: 20 mg/m2 and cohort-3: 30 mg/m2. Primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of IPP. Secondary endpoints include determining the safety and tolerability of IPP in combination with C and X, overall response rates, ascites response rate, progression-free survival, overall survival and effects on quality of life.

Important inclusion criteria include age ≥18 years, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 non-amplified gastric adenocarcinoma with histological or cytology-proven peritoneal involvement and adequate organ function. Exclusion criteria include previous malignancy within 5 years, recent abdominal or pelvic radiation treatment, significant abdominal adhesions or sepsis.

Ethics and dissemination
The study is approved by Southern Adelaide Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee. A manuscript will be prepared for publication on the completion of the trial. This study will be conducted according to the Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95) annotated with TGA comments (Therapeutic Goods Administration DSEB July 2000) and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The study will be performed in accordance with the NHMRC Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans (© Commonwealth of Australia 2007), and the NHMRC Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (©Australian Government 2007), and the principles laid down by the World Medical Assembly in the Declaration of Helsinki 2008.

==== Body
Strengths and limitations of the study
Currently, there are limited data to guide treatment in patients with gastric cancer and peritoneal metastases.

This study investigates a novel treatment: intraperitoneal paclitaxel in combination with standard chemotherapy (capecitabine and cisplatin).

Based on the results of this study, future studies will be designed to investigate the efficacy of this approach and to improve the outcomes in this population.

Not investigating the pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal paclitaxel is a potential limitation of our study.

Introduction
Gastric cancer
Gastric cancer is among the most common cancers and the second most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide.1 While responses can be achieved with chemotherapy, the cancer often develops resistance within 6 months. The median survival for the combination chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin and the fluoropyrimidine, capecitabine—which is considered one of the standard systemic chemotherapy regimens for advanced gastric cancer—is 10.5 months.2


Peritoneal involvement in gastric cancer
Advanced gastric cancer can spread via the transcoelomic route to involve the peritoneum and ascites often develops as a consequence. There have been few studies looking specifically at this group of patients with malignant ascites or peritoneal disease. Due to lack of measurable disease, some of these patients are ineligible for clinical trials. The few studies that have looked at this subgroup of patients have shown poor survival. Some of the regimens studied in this group of patients include modified fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin leading to 1-year survival of 27.2%,3 and sequential methotrexate/ fluorouracil (5FU) leading to 1-year survival of 16%.4


Paclitaxel in advance gastric cancer
In advanced gastric cancer, including cases with malignant ascites, paclitaxel has shown good response rates.5 The response rate to paclitaxel monotherapy has been reported to be 17%–28%.6–9 Combination chemotherapy regimens using paclitaxel have also been studied in a number of phase II studies (table 1).

Intraperitoneal paclitaxel
In ovarian cancer, a phase III randomised trial showed survival advantage for intravenous paclitaxel plus intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin and paclitaxel over intravenous paclitaxel plus cisplatin.10 Paclitaxel has been shown to have distinct pharmacokinetic advantages when given via an IP route. These include high IP concentration of the drug, as well as a longer half-life in the peritoneal cavity, compared with that observed with intravenous administration.11 This makes IP paclitaxel a compelling option for use in patients with peritoneal involvement from advanced gastric cancer.

Studies in Japan have reported that IP paclitaxel is well tolerated and active in patients with gastric cancer and peritoneal involvement.12 In a series of 100 patients, the median survival was 23 months, and the 12-month survival was 80%.13 The chemotherapy regimen used consisted of weekly intravenous paclitaxel at 50 mg/m2, IP paclitaxel at 20 mg/m2 and oral S1 (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) given on a 14-day regimen of 80 mg/m2 per day repeated every 3 weeks. It is of note that S1 may not be available for this indication in other parts of the world.

Rational for phase I study
The mentioned results have been achieved in a different genetic pool (Japanese population) using regimens that are not available in other parts of the world. We have designed this phase I trial to investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IP paclitaxel in combination with one of the standard chemotherapy combinations (cisplatin and capecitabine) in this patient population.

Justification of IP paclitaxel dose and escalation schedule
The MTD and recommended dose available from previous phase I study by Ishigami et al
12 is certainly informative but because we are suggesting the use of IP paclitaxel in a new combination and in a different genetic pool, these doses may not be accurate. Therefore, we have elected to start the IP paclitaxel from 10 mg/m2 which is one dose level lower than recommended dose by Ishigami et al. In our study, regardless of the IP paclitaxel, patients receive a standard regimen for their disease; therefore, despite the low starting dose of IP paclitaxel, undertreatment is not a concern. The next dose levels are to be increased in 10 mg/m2 increments to 30 mg/m2, unless the MTD is achieved.

Recently published studies
In a randomised phase III trial, Ishigami et al
14 enrolled patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis. Patients were randomised to receive IP and intravenous paclitaxel plus S-1 or S-1 plus cisplatin. In this study, median survival was not significantly different between the two arms.

Yonemura et al
15 showed that neoadjuvant laparoscopic hyperthermic IP chemoperfusion with docetaxel and cisplatin and neoadjuvant IP/systemic chemotherapy with S-1, docetaxel and cisplatin can lead to reduced Peritoneal Cancer Index in patients with gastric cancer with peritoneal metastasis.

Once the registration process has been completed, the subject will be assigned a subject study number.

Treatment plan
IP paclitaxel is the study intervention in this trial; intravenous cisplatin and oral capecitabine are required standard concomitant interventions.

Administration of study treatments
IP catheter
IP catheter insertion
Patients will have an IP catheter placed surgically after trial enrolment. The IP catheter is placed surgically, under general anaesthesia. The port should be secured to the anterior abdominal wall or the costal margin to enable easy access. The catheter should be tunnelled through the rectus sheath and muscle and secured to minimise the risk of an ascitic leak.

Possible adverse effects of IP catheter
Infection.

Abdominal pain.

Development of intra-abdominal adhesions.

Risk of organ perforation.

IP catheter blockage: in the event that the catheter is blocked and is not opened with conservative management including flushing with normal saline or simple manoeuvring, then this will be considered a rate-limiting toxicity and the catheter will be removed.

Endoscopic biopsy
Before the surgery for IP catheter insertion, four endoscopic biopsies of the primary gastric tumour should be taken as well as biopsies of the peritoneal disease. These biopsy specimens are to be stored as fresh tissue in RNAlater in separate containers for any and all later molecular analyses.

Chemotherapy
Paclitaxel
Preparation for IP administration: paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose, will be diluted in 250–500 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection or 5% dextrose injection.

Stability: the infusion should be completed within 24 hours of preparation of the solution and any residue discarded. Diluted solutions should be refrigerated if not used immediately to decrease the likelihood of microbial contamination.

Cisplatin
Preparation: the 10 mg and 50 mg vials should be reconstituted with 10 mL or 50 mL of sterile water for injection, The United States Pharmacopoeia (USP), respectively. Each mL of the resulting solution will contain 1 mg of cisplatin. Cisplatin should be diluted in 1 L of normal saline.

Stability: infusion should be completed within 24 hours of preparation and any residue discarded.

Capecitabine
Preparation: a combination of the 500 mg and 150 mg tablets will be administered to reach the desired dose of 1000 mg/m2.

Chemotherapy regimen and doses
Each cycle will be 21 days and includes the following combination:Capecitabine (oral) 1000 mg/m2 two times a day, days 1– 14 every 21 days.

Cisplatin at 80 mg/m2 day (intravenous), day 2 every 21 days.

Paclitaxel will be given on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 day cycle. The dose of paclitaxel will vary depending on the cohort as follows (table 2).




Table 2 Dosing of intraperitoneal paclitaxel based on 3+3 design

Cohort	No of patients	Paclitaxel dose given on day 1 and day 8 of a 21 day cycle	
1	3	10 mg/m2
	
2	3	20 mg/m2
	
3	6	30 mg/m2
	
If no dose-limiting toxicity is seen after three patients have completed treatment in cohort 3, this cohort will be expanded to six patients if maximum tolerated does has not been reached. There will be no further dose escalation after cohort 3.

If no dose-limiting toxicity is seen after three patients have completed treatment in cohort 1, patients will commence enrolment into cohort 2.

If no dose-limiting toxicity is seen after three patients have completed treatment in cohort 2, patients will commence enrolment into cohort 3.

Dose modifications
Dose modifications for cisplatin and capecitabine will be based on Eviq guidelines (https://www.eviq.org.au) (online supplementary file 2). Adverse events (AEs) are graded according to CTCAE V.4.0. In general, treatment should be withheld during AEs of severity G3-4, and not restarted until the AE has resolved to G0-1, at the investigator’s discretion. Day 1 treatment may be delayed for a maximum of 14 days. If the AE has not resolved to G0-1 after delaying day 1 treatment for 14 days, then study treatment should be discontinued. Treatment should not be delayed or modified for alopecia of any grade.

10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026732.supp2Supplementary data 


 Specified dose reductions apply to all subsequent doses of study drug. If a patient experiences several adverse events (SAEs) with differing recommendations, then the modification that results in the longest delay and lowest dose should be used.

Dose escalations or dose re-escalations after reductions for AEs are prohibited.

Rechallenge
If patients experience a suspected drug-related AE, they can interrupt the study medication until the symptoms resolve and then can reintroduce the study medication at the same dose. If the reaction reappears, then the study medication is to be discontinued permanently.

Concomitant medications/treatments
Include medications and treatments recommended, permitted (including rescue medication) and prohibited before and/or during the trial.

Recommended
The following medications and treatments are recommended in this study (table 3):

Safety reporting
Definitions
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigational subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. AEs include the following:All suspected adverse drug or device reactions.

All reactions from drug or device.

Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening (severity, frequency) of pre-existing illnesses.

Injury or accidents.

Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat examination).

Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a laboratory test).




Any untoward event that occurs after the protocol-specified reporting period which the investigator believes may be related to the drug or device. AEs must be reported as AEs even if they do not meet SAE criteria.

An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:results in death.

is life threatening (ie, the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event).

requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation.

results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.

is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.

other important medical events which, in the opinion of the investigator, are likely to become serious if untreated, or as defined in the protocol.




A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is an SAE that is related to the drug or device and is unexpected (ie, not listed in the investigator brochure or approved product information; or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the subject information sheet and informed consent form or elsewhere in the protocol.

Reporting of SAEs (including SUSARs)
The investigator is responsible for reporting all SAEs (including SUSARs) occurring during the study to the principal investigators (through FMC Medical Oncology Clinical Trials Unit) within 1 working day of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the SAE form. SAEs must be reported up to 30 days from the end of study intervention.

The principal investigators must notify the local Human Research Ethics Committees as required.

Pregnancy
In the event of a pregnancy occurring during the course of a study, the subject must be withdrawn from study drug immediately. Pregnancies occurring up to 6 months after the completion of the study drug must also be reported to the investigator. The investigator should counsel the patient, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.

Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study and up to 90 days after the completion of the test drug should also be reported to the principal investigators. The partner should be counselled and followed as described above.

Statistical considerations
This is an open-label phase 1 study with a standard 3+3 dose escalation design, therefore does not require sample size justification. The dose escalation is continued until the predefined number of DLT is reached.

Administrative aspects
Recruitment of participants
Patients attending oncology clinics within the Southern Adelaide Health Services that are potential candidates for the study will be given a patient information sheet by a member of the research team inviting them to participate in the study. Subjects willing to participate will meet with a study investigator to sign a consent form.

Consent
Involved clinicians will initially approach eligible patients to determine their interest in the study. Potential study subjects will be given a study patient information sheet. The purpose, requirements and risks of the study will be explained in a clear manner. Before witnessing the consent form, the investigator will discuss the study with the potential study subject to ensure that they fully understand the study risks, procedures and requirements.

Confidentiality
The study will be conducted in accordance with applicable privacy acts and regulations. All data generated in this study will remain confidential. All information will be stored securely at the clinical trials unit and will only be available to people directly involved with the study and who have signed a confidentiality agreement.

Protocol amendments
Changes and amendments to the protocol can only be made by the principal investigators. Approval of amendments by the Institutional Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) is required prior to their implementation.

Data handling and record keeping
All trial data required for the monitoring and analysis of the study will be recorded on the case report forms (CRF). All required data entry fields must be completed. Data corrections will be done according to the instructions provided. The investigator will be asked to confirm the accuracy of completed CRFs by signing key CRFs as indicated. All study-related documentation will be maintained for 15 years following completion of the study.

Study monitoring
Data from this study will be monitored by FMC Medical Oncology Clinical Trials Unit. Monitoring will include centralised review of CRFs and other study documents for protocol compliance, data accuracy and completeness.

Audit and inspection
This study may be subject to audit or inspection by representatives of regulatory bodies.
