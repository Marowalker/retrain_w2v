Depressive symptoms are common among people with dementia, impacting quality of
life and cognitive and functional decline. Currently, little is known about the
acceptability and feasibility of psychological interventions for people with mild
dementia, with recent reviews identifying the need for further evidence.
Developing and evaluating psychological interventions to prevent and treat these
symptoms is, therefore, an important clinical and research priority. This protocol
describes a study testing the acceptability and feasibility of a manual-based
behavioural activation (BA) intervention for preventing and treating depressive
symptoms in people with mild dementia. The aim of this study is to explore the
feasibility of conducting a pragmatic multicentre randomised controlled trial of
clinical effectiveness of an eight-session intervention. The Intervention to
prevent Depressive symptoms and promote well-being in EArly-stage dementia (IDEA)
programme supports people with dementia and their family carers in identifying and
scheduling enjoyable and meaningful activities.

Methods and analysis
Sixty people who have received a diagnosis of dementia of any type in the last
6 months will be recruited via memory clinics. Further criteria are a
Mini-Mental State Examination score of ≥20, and a family carer who can
assist with the intervention. Consenting participants will be randomised in a
ratio of 2:1 to BA or to treatment as usual. Analyses will estimate parameters
such as rates of recruitment, retention and number of sessions completed.
Questionnaires measuring depressive symptoms and quality of life for both the
person with dementia and their carer will be completed at baseline, 3 and 6
months. Qualitative interviews will explore acceptability of the intervention,
study procedures and experiences of the sessions.

Ethics and dissemination
This study received a favourable ethical opinion from the London Camberwell St
Giles Research Ethics Committee (16/LO/0540). We will disseminate findings at key
conferences, the Alzheimer’s Society and University College London websites
and local stakeholder events.

==== Body
Strengths and limitations of this study
This will be the first study to provide acceptability and feasibility data for a
psychological intervention based on behavioural activation for preventing and
treating depressive symptoms in people with mild dementia.

Explores feasibility parameters such as rates of recruitment, follow-up retention
and number of sessions completed, with several proposed outcome measures tested
for suitability of a full-scale trial.

By using both quantitative and qualitative data, the results will inform a future
large-scale randomised controlled trial of clinical effectiveness.

Limited to follow-ups at 3 and 6 months.

People with dementia and their carers will be recruited from two London National
Health Service sites which may be associated with sample selection bias.

Introduction
Dementia is a leading cause of disability in late life,1 with economic costs to society expected to double from
£26 billion per year to £55 billion in 2040 in the UK
alone.2 There are currently over
50 million people living with dementia, with numbers of people affected expected
to increase to 66 million by 2030.3 4
People with dementia are at increased risk of experiencing psychological distress such
as depression,5 6 which is not only distressing
but persistent and associated with increasing cognitive and functional decline,7 8 a risk of earlier care-home admission9 and reduced life expectancy.10 In line with current National Health Service policies and the
National Dementia Strategy,11 accessing
emotional, social and practical support after diagnosis is an important and timely
objective for people with dementia,12 13 and
it is reasonable to assume that people with dementia who additionally experience
symptoms of depression will require more resources and support. In a review of
experiences of postdiagnostic treatment, psychological care for people with dementia was
described as least developed,14 indicating that
access to psychological support remains poor despite an increasing emphasis on
supporting people to maintain a sense of well-being.

Current estimates show that up to 50% of people living with dementia experience
depression at least once during the course of the disease.15 Major depressive disorder affects approximately 20%–30% of
people with dementia,7 15 with personal or
family history of depression16 and a younger age
at onset of dementia increasing the risk of depression.17Subclinical or subthreshold symptoms of depression occur at a
higher rate than clinical depression,18 tend to
be highly persistent7 and are often experienced
during the early stages of the disease.19 Both
depression and less severe depressive symptoms are sources of excess disability for
people with dementia, therefore both major and subthreshold symptoms of depression are
considered clinically important.18 20

Although depression is associated with high burden for people with dementia and their
carers, there are currently no interventions available to prevent depressive symptoms
occurring or becoming worse, which is key given poor efficacy of antidepressants.21 Despite limited efficacy of pharmacological
interventions and increased risk of side effects, about a third of people with
Alzheimer’s disease living in the community are prescribed antidepressants,22 23 and up to 40% in care homes24 indicating a high need to manage these
symptoms.19

A Cochrane Review25 of the effects of
psychological treatments for people with dementia found that these treatments may
contribute to a reduction in depressive symptoms, however evidence comes mostly from
small-scale studies, with heterogeneous treatments.25 A recent systematic review of behavioural activation (BA) interventions
for older people found that these are associated with a reduction in depressive symptoms
in older people without dementia living in the community.26 The review also highlighted that most studies so far including people with
dementia do not use well-defined interventions. The long-term aim of this research is to
test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BA for people with dementia
living in the community.

This study aims to establish the acceptability and feasibility of an 8-week intervention
using BA principles27 28 developed after
extensive consultations and field testing with people with mild dementia and their
family carers. The study design is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT), with
two treatment arms (BA vs treatment as usual) following participants over 8 months. A
secondary objective is to test the feasibility of procedures for conducting and planning
a multicentre RCT by exploring trial processes, and acceptability and feasibility of the
intervention.

Methods and analysis
Participant recruitment
Inclusion criteria
Participants will be people who have received a diagnosis of dementia of any type
in the last 6 months and: (1) are living in the community, (2) have a family carer
who is available to participate and support the person in the intervention and (3)
have mild dementia (determined by a Mini- Mental State Examination score
of ≥20).

Exclusion criteria
Participants will be excluded if (1) they are deemed by their clinical team to be
at risk of self-harm (excluding neglect) or a risk to others, (2) have
difficulties communicating in English or (3) are already taking part in another
intervention study. People with previous depression, or previous or current
treatment with antidepressants or experience of psychological treatments will not
be excluded. The study will recruit a total of 60 people with dementia and their
carers from memory clinics and community mental health teams of older people in
London. Potential participants will be recruited by clinicians in relevant Trusts,
by invitation letter or by a ‘consent to contact’ approach.

Sample size considerations and randomisation
A total of 60 people will be recruited29
30 and randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to either the BA intervention or
treatment as usual. Among the 40 participants in the BA arm, we will be able to
estimate 75% acceptability of the IDEA intervention with a 95% CI of 59% to 87%.

Participant randomisation will be undertaken at University College London (UCL) using
a randomisation system stratified by site provided by internet-based sealed envelope
codes, based on random permuted blocks of sizes three and six to allow a 2:1
allocation to intervention and treatment as usual. Randomisation allocation will be
sent by automated email, to the non-blind researcher performing the randomisation
using their unique user name and password.

Treatment as usual
This study is designed to be a pragmatic feasibility study, and no participants will
be denied access to any treatment that they would have had access to. Both groups
will receive regular treatment as usual, which is expected to be in line with
the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for treatment
of dementia, details of which will be recorded for each participant using the Client
Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI).31

Blinding
All follow-up assessments will be conducted by a researcher who is blind to treatment
allocation. In trials of psychological interventions, it is difficult to blind
therapists and participants to which intervention they are delivering or receiving.
Any incidents of non-blinding will be recorded to inform the future trial.

Intervention
The proposed intervention will follow theory and models of BA,27 28 and key components identified to be associated with
effectiveness in trials of older people.26 BA
is defined as a brief structured therapeutic approach aimed at increasing engagement
in adaptive activities often associated with pleasure and mastery, through structured
activity scheduling and monitoring of mood, supplemented by additional behavioural
strategies, such as relaxation techniques, and hierarchical construction of
goals.26

The IDEA intervention will include:identifying pleasant activities for the person and developing and agreeing a
plan of which activities to implement

setting goals about implementing these activities

monitoring and reviewing activities on a weekly basis

teaching of specific relaxation skills32

discussing accessing help

making a plan for the future.



The intervention will be an individual home-based manualised programme, comprised of
a total of eight weekly 1-hour sessions, delivered by a psychology graduate who will
be trained in the intervention and supervised monthly by one of the coinvestigators.
Based on the suggestions and observations when developing the intervention,
session frequency will depend on participants, with sessions completed over
8–12 weeks.

Adherence to treatment protocol
A manual guiding therapists in delivering the intervention will be developed,
describing its key components. The feasibility of the treatment-adherence measures
and competency assessment will be assessed by developing a checklist for use in the
main trial.

Subsequent assessments of outcomes
All participants receiving the intervention will be asked to complete a follow-up
qualitative interview at their home administered by a researcher not providing the
intervention. These interviews will examine experiences and expectations of the
intervention, and suitability of intervention materials in order to inform their
further refinement in the main trial. Participants will be recruited until
theoretical saturation has been achieved. Data on acceptability, completion rates and
attrition will be supplemented by qualitative data.

Proposed outcome measures for the full-scale clinical trial
The flow diagram of the current trial is presented in figure 1. In order to inform the future trial, outcome measures will be
trialled for suitability. Depressive symptoms is proposed as the outcome for the main
study. Carers will complete generic health and quality of life measures, and resource
use questionnaires to examine the feasibility of cost-effectiveness analysis.
Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 3 and 6 months after
randomisation.

Outcomes tested for acceptability for the main trial
Depressive symptoms—Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia
(CSDD).33 The CSDD is a 19-item
interviewer-administered measure which uses information provided by
interviewing the person with dementia and their carer. Symptoms are described
to the carer as they appear on the scale. Where there is a discrepancy between
the carer and the researcher’s ratings the carer is reinterviewed before
making a final judgement.

Self-rated and carer-rated dementia-specific quality of life for the person
with dementia—DEMQOL andDEMQOL-proxy.34 The DEMQOL measures quality of life,35 in five domains, including daily activities, health and
well-being, cognitive functioning, social relationships and self-concept. The
scale is used as a self-rated or carer-rated report, administered to the person
with dementia and carer, with established validity.36

Self-rated and carer-rated quality of life using the European Quality of Life-5
Dimensions (EQ-5D) for the person with dementia, measured using the three-level
response version of the EQ-5D, a standardised instrument for use as a measure
of health outcome.37

Neuropsychiatric symptoms—Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).38 The NPI assesses 12 behavioural
disturbances occurring in people with dementia as rated by the carer, using a
screening strategy to minimise administration time by examining and scoring
only those behavioural domains that have positive responses to screening
questions. Both frequency and severity of each behaviour are also rated with
higher scores indicative of more symptoms. Both validity and reliability of the
measure have been established.35

Health services utilisation—CSRI.39 The CSRI will be used to collect feasibility data on the use of
health and social care services provided by public or non-public bodies, and
information on carers’ costs and participants’ use of health and
social care services to inform the full trial. The feasibility of collecting
service-use data will be assessed, which will allow identification of services
received in both groups and any changes that may occur.

Carers’ mental health—Hospital and Anxiety Depression Scale
(HADS).40 Depressive and anxiety
symptoms in carers will be measured using HADS, a self-rated measure,
generating scores for both generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, used
widely to identify caseness for clinically significant depression and
anxiety.41

Carers' quality of life—the EQ-5D37 and Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12).42 Carer health-related quality of life will be measured
using the EQ-5D. Carers’ mental and physical health will be measured by
the SF-12, measuring health by standardised responses, expressed in terms of
two meta-scores: the physical component summary and the mental component
summary.

Safety monitoring
Adverse events will be closely monitored. These are events that are likely to affect
to a significant degree the safety or physical or mental integrity of the
participants in the trial. The sponsor will be notified immediately of any case where
the above definition applies during the trial.

Statistical analysis plan
Given this is a feasibility study, it does not aim to provide a hypothesis test of
the effectiveness of the intervention but to estimate feasibility study parameters.
The main aims, therefore, are feasibility of the randomised controlled study and
acceptability of the intervention for people with dementia and their carers. We will,
therefore, test analysis procedures in order to inform the statistical analysis plan
of the main trial as opposed to making statistical comparisons of outcomes between
the intervention and treatment as usual groups. The analyses will include the
following:rates of clinicians’ referrals, number of participants recruited and
randomised to the study (number of dyads referred and recruited per month,
percentage reaching inclusion criteria and any barriers or facilitators to
recruitment);

percentage of eligible participants who consent to the study;

percentage of BA sessions completed (percentage in the BA group completing
all sessions);

follow-up rates and number completing each outcome measure proposed for the
main trial.



We will produce a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials diagram to represent
numbers of people with dementia eligible for inclusion, numbers recruited, randomised
and completing the study. Details of participants who meet the inclusion criteria but
are not randomised will be recorded in order to inform the future trial. Essential
baseline information will be recorded which will include quantitative and qualitative
information (ie, specifics of diagnosis, psychiatric history, use of medications and
demographics). In line with the current recommendations of Good Clinical
Practice, analyses will be descriptive. We will estimate SDs (95% CIs) of
potential outcome measures at baseline, 3 and 6 months and changes in scores from
baseline. We will use rates of missing questionnaire data to inform the full trial.
For the feasibility economic evaluation component, we will collect data on resource
use and costs for the future trial including resources required to deliver the
intervention.

Ethics and dissemination
Ethics
The study is registered as a clinical trial and has been allocated an International
Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN75503960). As the intervention is
a psychological therapy, the trial is not covered by the Medicines for Human Use
(Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.

Informed consent and withdrawal from the study
Participants will be in the mild stages of dementia, and therefore would generally be
expected to be able to provide informed consent. In instances where the
participant’s level of impairment increases, such that they are no
longer able to provide informed consent, the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act
will be followed. Participants will be informed of their right to withdraw at any
time without their care being affected in any way.

Data management
All participant information will be stored in accordance with the UK Data protection
Act 1998 guidance, with all personally identifiable information stored in locked
cabinets and stored separately from study data which will be anonymised and saved on
password-protected computers at UCL, in line with UCL Data Protection Policy.

Patient and public involvement
Local user groups of people with dementia and their carers, and professionals
supporting them have been consulted and involved in the design of the study, the
development of the intervention and recruitment strategies.43 A dissemination strategy will be developed that will identify
key stakeholder groups who will be communicated of the study’s findings. We
will also consult our Patient and Public Involvement members for the design of the
main trial.

Oversight committees
A Trial Steering Committee has been set-up and will include an independent chair, two
independent members and the study’s coinvestigator(s).

Discussion
This study will evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a psychological
intervention using BA principles to prevent and treat depressive symptoms for people
with mild dementia informing a clinical and cost-effectiveness trial. In line with
Medical Research Council guidelines,44 we will
use data from this study to further refine the intervention, produce a training package
and inform approaches for recruitment and analyses for the full-scale trial. This
feasibility study is necessary preparatory work to inform a full RCT and the
psychological care of people with dementia.

Trial sponsorship
UCL is the nominated sponsor.
