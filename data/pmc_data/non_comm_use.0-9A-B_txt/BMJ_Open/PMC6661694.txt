This article was previously published with errors in data and author affiliation.

The correct author affiliations for Angel Chater are

School of Sport Science and Physical Activity, University of Bedfordshire, Bedford, UK.

University College London School of Pharmacy, London, UK.

In the ‘Introduction’ section, fourth paragraph, the data should be ‘34 000 nurses and 8000 pharmacists’ instead of ‘30 000 nurses and 4000 pharmacists’.

The correct casing for ‘Intervention Functions’ is Intervention Functions throughout the article.

The abbreviation for nurse in ‘(I=interviewee, n=nurse, P=pharmacist)’ is N under ‘Factors influencing the management of RTIs’ subsection in ‘Results’.

Under the section ‘Factors influencing the management of RTIs’, the correct sub-heading is ‘Goals (reflective motivation)’ instead of ‘Goals (automatic motivation)’.

Under ‘Comparison with other studies’ in ‘Discussion’, the period should be removed before the word 'knowledge'. The correct statement is '… associated with the TDF domain knowledge, were 'Information about…’.

In Supplementary Table 1, the Theoretical Domain ‘Goals’ is part of Motivation (Reflective) column instead of Motivation (Automatic). Motivation (Automatic) begins from ‘Reinforcement’.
