To evaluate the effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention following lumbar
spinal fusion.

Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis. 2 independent reviewers searched information
sources, assessed studies for inclusion and evaluated risk of bias. Quantitative
synthesis using standardised mean differences was conducted on comparable outcomes
across trials with similar interventions.

Information sources
Predefined terms were employed to search electronic databases. Additional studies
were identified from key journals, reference lists, authors and experts.

Eligibility criteria for included studies
Randomised control trials published in English prior to 30 September 2011
investigating physiotherapy outpatient management of patients
(>16 years), following lumbar spinal fusion, with measurements
reported on one or more outcome of disability, function and health were
included.

Results
2 Randomised control trials (188 participants) from two countries were included.
Both trials included a behavioural and an exercise intervention. 1 trial was
evaluated as high risk of bias and one as unclear. 159 participants were
incorporated in the meta-analysis. Although evidence from both trials suggested
that intervention might reduce back pain short term (6 months) and long
term (12 months and 2 years), and a behavioural intervention might
be more beneficial than an exercise intervention, the pooled effects (0.72, 95% CI
−0.25 to 1.69 at 6 months; 0.52, 95% CI −0.45 to 1.49 at
12 months and 0.75, 95% CI −0.46 to 1.96 at 2 years) did not
demonstrate statistically significant effects. There was no evidence that
intervention changes pain in the short (6 months) or long term
(12 months and 2 years). The wide CI for pooled effects indicated
that intervention could be potentially beneficial or harmful. Considerable
heterogeneity was evident.

Conclusions
Inconclusive, very low-quality evidence exists for the effectiveness of
physiotherapy management following lumbar spinal fusion. Best practice remains
unclear. Limited comparability of outcomes and retrieval of only two trials
reflect a lack of research in this area that requires urgent consideration.

Article summary
Article focus
Physiotherapy intervention is recommended following lumbar spinal fusion.

However, the most beneficial intervention and the effectiveness of
physiotherapy management are unclear.

The objective was to evaluate effectiveness of physiotherapy intervention in
patients following lumbar spinal fusion on clinically relevant outcomes, short
and long term.

Key messages
Inconclusive, very low-quality evidence exists for the effectiveness of
physiotherapy management following lumbar spinal fusion.

Best practice remains unclear.

Limited comparability of outcomes and retrieval of only two trials reflect a
lack of research in this area that requires urgent consideration.

Strengths and limitations of this study
The strengths of this review are its focus to physiotherapy intervention and it
being the first in this area; exploring the breadth of potential physiotherapy
interventions.

The key limitation of this review is that differences were evident in the
content and nature of interventions, selection of outcome measures and timing
of assessment points, contributing to heterogeneity in treatment effects.

Introduction
Rationale
In the UK National Health Service, surgery is the greatest single component of
expenditure for managing low back pain, with increasing numbers of lumbar fusions
being performed.1 More than 4036 operations
were performed in 2009/2010,2 reflecting a 14%
increase from 2008/2009. The USA has also seen a well-documented increase in lumbar
fusion surgery rates from 1990 to 2001 of 220%,3
4 with a corresponding 500% increase in
spending for lumbar fusion from 1992 to 2003.5
The increased rates are partially attributable to advances in technology, including
the Food and Drug Administration approval of intervertebral cage implants (1996) and
pedicle screws (1998). Although overall lumbar surgical rates in the USA reduced from
2002 to 2007, fusion rates increased from 1.3 to 10.9 per 100 000
patients.6 In 1992, lumbar fusion accounted
for 14% spending on back surgery in the USA, and by 2003, this had increased to
47%.5 Additional contributions to this
increasing problem include more than 200 lumbar fusion revision operations performed
annually in the UK,2 with a re-hospitalisation
rate of 13% within 30 days of surgery documented in the USA.6


The primary indication for lumbar fusion is pain (back and/or leg pain) from joints
with degenerative disease. Lumbar fusion is thought to stabilise the spine and reduce
the need for further surgery.7 A Cochrane
review of spinal surgery for lumbar spondylosis due to degenerative causes1 identified trials of variable quality, with an
emphasis on surgical rather than patient outcomes, and little information available
regarding occupational or long-term outcomes. The review concluded that there were
conflicting results for surgery.1 These
findings were confirmed by Sogaard et al
8 who summarised the literature and also
concluded that there are minimal data on the reported success for patient outcome
following lumbar fusion. Data from the Swedish National Spine Register reported that
25% patients reported no change or worsened pain following lumbar fusion (back and/or
leg pain) and that at 12 months following surgery, 40% of patients reported
dissatisfaction regarding the outcome of the surgery.9


Re-operation rates have recently become a focus of investigation. Martin et
al
7 investigated the cumulative incidence of
second operation for degenerative conditions in one USA state, finding that an
increased proportion of fusion operations and the technical development of implants
did not affect the rate of re-operation. Indeed, surgery in the late 1990s was more
likely to be repeated than that in the early 1990s, contributing to a
‘substantial’ likelihood of re-operation.10


The existing variability of evidence to evaluate efficacy of lumbar fusion and some
evidence of persisting symptoms and dissatisfaction following surgery highlights the
necessity for evidence of the effectiveness of post-operative rehabilitation.
Evidence for rehabilitation following surgical intervention in low back pain is an
area of increasing interest, for example, post-discectomy.11
12 There is some debate in the literature
regarding timing of intervention post-lumbar fusion owing to concern over the
potential of early exercise to overload internal fixation. In view of this,
Christensen et al
13 commenced rehabilitation after
3 months, although Rohlmann et al
14 found no evidence of compromise of internal
fixation through exercises, except perhaps through walking as an exercise.

There is no systematic review investigating effectiveness of rehabilitation in a
post-lumbar fusion population. Although physiotherapy intervention is recommended
post-lumbar fusion, its effectiveness is unclear, with no evaluation of existing
trials through a systematic review. Consequently, current practice and best
physiotherapy practice are unclear.

Objective
To investigate the short- and long-term effectiveness of physiotherapy outpatient
management following lumbar spinal fusion in terms of disability, function and
health15 in patients aged
>16 years.

Materials and methods
A protocol following method guidelines by the Back Review Group of the Cochrane
Collaboration16 and Cochrane handbook17 informed the conduct of a systematic review,
which is reported in line with the PRISMA statement.18

Study selection
Two subject experts (GE/E-JP to 15 March 2011 and GE/RB updated to 30 September 2011)
searched information sources independently and assessed identified studies for
inclusion, facilitated by grading each criterion (table 1) as eligible/not eligible/might be eligible.20 The full text of a study was reviewed and the study considered
potentially relevant when it could not be clearly excluded on the basis of its Title
and Abstract19 following discussion between
the two independent reviewers. Full text was obtained for abstracts with insufficient
information or in a situation of disagreement. A study was included when both
reviewers independently assessed it as satisfying the inclusion criteria from the
full text. A third reviewer (AR, methodological and subject expert) mediated in the
event of disagreement following discussion.16

Risk of bias for each included trial was independently assessed by the same initial
reviewers. Consistent with Cochrane,17 risk of
bias and homogeneity of participants, interventions and outcome measures were
important considerations informing potential inclusion of trials in meta-analyses,
thereby ensuring meaningfulness of findings from a clinical perspective. The third
reviewer mediated in situations of disagreement.16 Cohen's κ was used to assess agreement between
reviewers.21 All tools and processes were
piloted prior to use.

Data collection process
Using a standardised form, two reviewers (AR/CW) extracted the data
independently.19
22 A third reviewer (NH) independently checked
for consistency and clarity.

Data items
Data extracted for each trial included design, participants and indication,
interventions and study setting, outcome measures, timing of assessments, and main
results. Key outcome measures of interest were predefined as valid tools to measure
pain, disability, function, physical impairment, social impact and patient
satisfaction, as reflected in the domains from the WHO's International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health.15


Risk of bias in individual studies
The Cochrane ‘risk of bias’ assessment tool23 was used to assess the internal validity of each included
trial. This approach was developed through empirical research18
23 unlike most quality scales.24–26 Each ‘risk of
bias’ component was reported independently, in relation to each outcome
measure.23
27 Assessment by reviewers acknowledged that
the component of ‘blinding’ the treating therapist is generally
impossible23 and the Cochrane tool
permitted evaluation of the likely influence of lack of blinding.

Summary measures
In accordance with the protocol, quantitative synthesis was conducted on comparable
key outcomes across trials that had similar interventions (nature of intervention)
and timing of assessments (at approximately 6 months, 12 months and
2 years post-surgery). Tools developed to measure the same underlying domain
of the International Classification of Functioning15 were defined as comparable outcomes. Subject and methodological experts
(AR/CW/GJ) identified the combinations of trials and outcomes on which to conduct
meta-analyses. All results were reported in the context of overall risk of bias for a
trial.

Meta-analyses, conducted through RevMan, compared standardised differences in means
using DerSimonian–Laird random effects28
29 as the principal analyses to allow for
systematic differences in effects estimated across the included trials.19
29 Ninety-five per cent confidence intervals
were reported for summary statistics. For comparisons across trials that reported
different measurement tools for the same outcome19 or a mixture of final value scores and change from baseline scores,
standardised mean differences were selected.30


Planned methods of analysis
All authors were contacted to request either raw data or additional summary
statistics to those reported. No raw data were supplied, and analyses were therefore
conducted on the reported final summary statistics. Standard deviations were
estimated from reported CIs or percentiles, as necessary.30 Change scores were used for studies when no other data were
forthcoming, in-line with the use of random effects as primary analyses.29 Heterogeneity in treatment effects was
considered by computation of I2. An analysis of the quality of the
interventions was undertaken as the basis for interpretation of heterogeneity.19
31


Risk of bias across trials
Retrieval of too few trials reporting comparable outcome measures prohibited visual
assessment of potential publication bias using Funnel plots.19 Consensus regarding the overall potential risk of bias was
facilitated through tabulation of the summary assessment for risk of bias.

Additional analyses
With only two trials included in the review, there was a lack of information on which
to conduct post-hoc supportive analyses beyond descriptive analysis.

Results
Study selection
In total, four articles8
13
32
33 and two trials13
33 from two countries were included. For one
trial,13 two further articles retrieved
presented additional data to the original trial and were considered as part of the
main trial.8
32 All but one of the retrieved trials were
published in English. No relevant unpublished studies were found. Figure 1 presents the numbers of studies at each
stage of selection. Complete inter-reviewer agreement was achieved on study inclusion
following discussion.

Methods
Abbott et al
33 randomised participants across two
groups and compared exercise therapy with psychomotor therapy. Christensen
et al
13 randomised participants across three
groups and compared a video of home exercises, a back-cafe and a training
intervention. Both trials, therefore, included a behavioural and an exercise
intervention. Duration of interventions ranged from 1 day to
9 weeks, starting between 1 day and 3 months post-surgery.
Abbott et al,33 therefore,
commenced interventions during the patient's inpatient stay. The number of
assessments varied from 3 to 4, occurring 3 months to 2/3 years
post-surgery.

Participants
Although the population for trial inclusion was broad and encompassed all patients
following lumbar spinal fusion, both trials included patients of primarily a
degenerative cause. The two trials randomised a total of 188 participants. Age
varied from 18 to 65 years. One hundred and fifty-nine participants were
included in the meta-analyses (table 2)
that omitted one of the three groups from Christensen et al.13


Interventions
Both trials were conducted at single centres. Settings for interventions ranged
from home to inpatient wards and to outpatient physiotherapy clinics/sections of
the hospital. One trial13 included at least
one intervention that was a group intervention (back-cafe), although it was
unclear whether their exercise training intervention was also a group
intervention. All other interventions were individual 1:1 interventions.
Interventions could be grouped according to whether they were focused on exercise
or a behavioural approach. Exercise interventions included exercise therapy
commenced in an inpatient ward and progressed prior to discharge to provide a
programme of home exercises33 and a
1.5 h training session twice a week.13 Both exercise interventions included components in the hospital
environment (as an inpatient or outpatient) and one included home exercises.33 Behavioural interventions included
psychomotor therapy using cognitive behavioural principles in addition to
exercise33 and a back-cafe using
physiotherapist and group support to continue exercises. Timing of interventions
ranged from 1 day to 9 weeks, starting between 1 day and
3 months post-surgery.

Primary outcomes
One trial specified a primary outcome: the Oswestry Disability Index V.2.0.33


Secondary and additional outcomes
Both trials reported some assessment of back pain, psychological functioning and
measures of occupational outcome. No other comparable outcome measures were used
across the two trials. One aspect of the psychosocial outcomes, the influence of
back pain on future life, was reported by both trials. However the quality of the
outcome was unclear in one trial.13 Other
outcomes included the following: Visual Analogue Scale back pain, subcomponents of
the Low Back Pain Rating Scale (back and leg pain; function and psychological
capacity), European Quality of Life Questionnaire EQ-5D, SF-36 mental health
subscale, Self-efficacy Scale, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, Tampa Scale for
Kinesiophobia, Coping Strategies Questionnaire, Return to Work, work status and
back-related healthcare.

Risk of bias within studies
Good inter-reviewer agreement was achieved on risk of bias (Cohen's κ
0.613, 95% CI 0.359 to 0.868).21 Of the two
included trials, one was evaluated overall as high risk of bias13 and one as unclear33
(table 3). Risk of bias was, therefore,
considered in conjunction with other indicators of study differences (comparability
of interventions, outcome measures and timings of assessments) to determine any
appropriate quantitative synthesis of the trials.19 Interestingly, in the subsequent reporting of the Christensen
trial,8
32 the risk of bias was improved, although,
overall, it remained high (table 3). This
suggests that poor reporting contributed to the rating of high risk of bias for
multiple issues in the original trial report.

Risk of bias across studies
Christensen et al
13 had one high-risk component owing to poor
reporting affording a lack of clarity across all components, no primary outcome being
pre-specified, no primary end point being pre-specified and no intention-to-treat
analysis reported. Both trials reported losses to follow-up. However, in both trials,
losses were <20% and evaluated as acceptable.34 Interpretation of results could be affected by the high proportion of
information from one trial identified as high risk of bias.23


Results of individual trials and synthesis of results
Only trials evaluated as high or unclear risk of bias were available for
meta-analysis. Although the reasons for the high-risk components provided concern for
potential bias, critical evaluation of results from meta-analyses enabled an overview
of the current evidence and strength of effect to be presented, which permitted
tentative conclusions to be proposed to advance research. Exploration of inter-trial
compatibility of outcomes and assessment points identified back pain as the only
possible comparison for exercise versus behavioural interventions, at
6 months, 12 months and 2 years. Reporting ‘mean change
from baseline’ (SD)33 for back pain
intensity during the previous week on a 0–100 mm Visual Analogue Scale
was evaluated as a comparable outcome to reporting median (range)13 for ‘mean back pain intensity’
within the previous 14 days on a 0–10 scale as part of the Low Back
Pain Rating Scale.

At 6 months, the evidence from one trial13 suggested that intervention might reduce back pain, with a behavioural
intervention being beneficial compared with an exercise intervention (figure 2). The pooled random effects (0.72, 95%
CI −0.25 to 1.69) did not support evidence of an effect at 6-month short
term.

At 12 months, the evidence from one trial13 suggested that intervention might reduce pain, with a behavioural
intervention being beneficial compared with an exercise intervention (figure 3). The pooled random effects (0.52, 95%
CI −0.45 to 1.49) did not support evidence of an effect at 12-month long
term.

At 2 years, the evidence from one trial13 suggested that intervention might reduce pain, with a behavioural
intervention being beneficial compared with an exercise intervention (figure 4). The pooled random effects (0.75, 95%
CI −0.46 to 1.96) did not support evidence of an effect at 2-year long term.
Overall, there was no evidence that intervention changes pain in the shorter
(6 months) or long term (12 months or 2 years).

Additional analyses
The wide CIs for pooled effects indicated intervention could be potentially
beneficial or harmful. No evidence from supportive analyses conflicted with the
primary analyses.

Discussion
Summary of evidence
Evidence was assessed from two randomised controlled trials (188 participants)
conducted across two countries focused to lumbar fusion as a consequence of
predominantly degenerative causes. Both trials included individualised 1:1 management
and one trial13 included group management.
Interventions were grouped into exercise versus behavioural comparisons. One trial
was evaluated as high risk of bias and one as unclear. There were multiple issues
contributing to the high risk of bias for Christensen et al
13 The number of issues did lessen in
subsequent reporting of the Christensen trial,8
32 suggesting that trial reporting was
problematic. One hundred and fifty-nine participants from the two trials were
included in the meta-analyses. The only comparable outcome across the trials was back
pain in the short (6 months) and long terms (12 months and
2 years). There was, consequently, limited comparability of outcomes to
evaluate the potential benefits of physiotherapy intervention. No patients
>65 years were included in either of the two trials. This is
problematic with a documented increase in patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion
from 2000/2001 to 2009/2010 in patients in the UK aged 60–74 years of
14%–22% and aged 75+ years of 2%–6%.2


Results from the trial by Abbott et al,33 which was rated as unclear risk of bias, indicated no
statistically significant difference across groups (n=54, n=53) with
regard to pain, in the short or long term. Although findings from Christensen
et al
13 indicated a statistically significant
benefit of behavioural intervention reducing pain in the short and longer term, there
were multiple issues contributing to the high risk of bias for this trial and low
numbers of participants (n=29, n=26 and n=26 in the three
groups). It is noted that for Christensen et al,13 the 95% CIs were positioned completely within
the ‘favours’ behavioural intervention, illustrating some conflict
within the pooled evidence from the two trials. Also of note were the narrower CIs
for Abbott et al
33 reflecting the much larger sample size in
that trial. The pooled random effects of results from the two trials provided no
supporting evidence of an effect. Overall, there was no evidence that physiotherapy
management changes back pain.

The strengths of this review are its focus to physiotherapy intervention and it being
the first in this area, exploring the breadth of potential physiotherapy
interventions. It is, therefore, not possible to compare the findings with previous
reviews. The key findings of this review (only two trials, no evidence of the
benefits of physiotherapy management) are a concern owing to the documented
re-operation rate,2
7
10 re-hospitalisation rate6 and increasing numbers of patients undergoing
lumbar spinal fusion surgery.2–4
6 When combined with existing literature
reporting variability of conclusions and minimal data on the reported success for
patient outcome following lumbar fusion, this concern contributes to a developing
health problem, with available data supporting 25% patients reporting no change or
worsened pain following surgery and 40% patients reporting dissatisfaction regarding
their outcome 12 months following surgery.9 Consequently, there are major societal and economic implications from
this ongoing disability, dissatisfaction and requirement for further intervention.
Effective rehabilitation of patients following lumbar spinal fusion surgery is
therefore an important issue.

Limitations
Differences were evident in the content and nature of interventions, selection of
outcome measures and timing of assessment points, contributing to heterogeneity in
treatment effects. Differences in components of the physiotherapy interventions might
be explained by diversity in practice between countries. These differences limited
the possible comparisons in the meta-analysis. Surprisingly, it was not possible to
conduct analysis of occupational outcome measures, despite their importance being
identified within the literature.1


Considerable heterogeneity was present in the evidence for behavioural intervention
for pain at 6 months (I2 88%), 12 months (I2 88%)
and 2 years (I2 92%),30
perhaps explaining no evidence of an effect for all evaluations. This anticipated
heterogeneity was accounted for by using the random effects model.

Using GRADE35 (the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation system), the quality of the body of evidence
for physiotherapy rehabilitation in the management of patients following lumbar
fusion, based on the two trials included in the meta-analyses of behavioural versus
exercise intervention, is very low for back pain in both the short
and long term. These estimates are interpreted as ‘little confidence in the
effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the
estimate of effect’.35 Downgrading of
quality was due to high risk of bias and issues of imprecision and
inconsistency.35 The conclusions of
cost-effectiveness8 in the subsequent
reporting of Christensen et al
13 are uncertain considering the very
low quality.

The few trials available of high and unclear risk of bias and considerable
heterogeneity illustrate the necessity for a high-quality and properly powered trial
to evaluate a post-lumbar spinal fusion population. Meta-analyses depend upon the
availability of published trials, and in this topical area that is increasing in
profile, only two trials were available. The very low quality of
existing trials is consistent with earlier findings for physiotherapy management
post-lumbar discectomy.12
36 Within physiotherapy, there is currently
limited scope for good quality meta-analyses with well-reported and rigorous criteria
for trial inclusion.36 Owing to the limited
comparability of outcome measures possible, consensus for a minimum core set of
outcome measures for specific populations is also required.

Conclusions
This systematic review has identified inconclusive very low-quality
evidence35 for the effectiveness of
physiotherapy management following lumbar spinal fusion. Best practice for physiotherapy
management is, therefore, unclear. There is no identified potential benefit for
improving pain. However, the limited comparability of outcome measures and retrieval of
only two trials reflects a lack of published research in this area. This gap requires
urgent consideration, in a properly powered clinical trial with attention to quality
and, in particular, to ensuring a low risk of bias. Inclusion of other outcomes that are
important to the WHO's classification15 is
important, particularly occupational outcomes.1
