Rydzewska E, Hughes-McCormack LA, Gillberg C, et al. Prevalence of long-term health conditions in adults with autism: observational study of a whole country population BMJ Open 2018;8:e023945. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023945.

This article was previously published with some errors.

In result section of the abstract, the percentage of deafness/hearing loss, physical disability and the OR for mental health conditions are incorrect.

deafness/hearing loss should be 14.1% instead of 17.5%

physical disability should be 24.0% instead of 30.7%

OR for mental health conditions should be OR 8.6 (95% CI 8.2 to 9.1) instead of OR 8.6 (95% CI 8.2 to 9.0).

On the prevalence of reported comorbidities section (page 3) it reads:

Table 3 shows the OR (95% CI) of autism predicting each of the six conditions: OR 3.3 (3.1 to 3.6) for deafness or partial hearing loss, OR 8.5 (7.9 to 9.2) for blindness or partial sight loss, OR 94.6 (89.4 to 100.0) for intellectual disabilities, OR 8.6 (8.2 to 9.0) for mental health conditions, OR 6.2 (5.8 to 6.6) for physical disability and OR 2.6 (2.5 to 2.8) for other condition.

It should read:

On the discussion section, first sentence of the first paragraph reads:

Comorbidity is substantially greater in adults with reported autism than in other people; with ORs of 95 for intellectual disabilities, 9 for mental health conditions, 9 for deafness or partial hearing loss, 6 for physical disability, 3 for blindness or partial sight loss and 3 for other condition.

On the discussion section, third sentence of the second paragraph reads:

We found 14% with hearing impairment (range 7%–46% depending on age group; 5%–44% for men and 11%–47% for women), and 12% with visual impairments (range 7%–30% depending on age group; 7%–27% for men and 10%–35% for women), notably higher than the rates recorded in medical records reported in the North California study (4.7% and 1.1% respectively, though ORs were not dissimilar)9 likely reflecting the different study methodologies.

On the discussion section, fifth sentence of the second paragraph reads:

A high rate of intellectual disabilities in children with autism has been described previously; we have now quantified the extent of this—29% (25%–32% depending on age group; 22%–35% for men and 31%–42% for women)—in a much larger study of adults.

On the discussion section, sixth sentence of the second paragraph reads:

There are few other studies with which we can draw comparisons, and we identified none on physical disability in adults with autism with which we could compare the high rate of 24% for all adults aged 25+ (range 15%–45% depending on age group; 14%–42% for men and 24%–45% for women).

In table 1, the total number for the gender of 25-34 years is 667 327 instead of 632 488.
