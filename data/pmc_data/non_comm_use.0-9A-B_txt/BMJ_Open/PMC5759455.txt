Implementation according CPGs in practice have positive effects on health professionals' practice and patient outcomes.

The aim of this study is to Critical Appraisal of Evidence-based Nursing Care Guideline by Using the AGREE II instrument.

Critical appraisal of guideline was evaluated in 6 domains of AGREEII tool by expert panel. Expert panel(n=10) consist of specialist in endocrinology and diabetes field and nursing faculty member of Guilan University of Medical Sciences(GUMS) had research in diabetes and DFU. Applicability of guideline in clinical was assess with checklist by nursing group. Nursing group (n=28) consists of head nurses and all nurses of endocrine and surgery units, and educational nursing supervisor of RAZI hospital affiliated to GUMS.

Results
Among 114studies, evidence of 19 studies was selected and categorized based on 8NDs. According to mean scores of CVI/CVR of evidence, some evidence was revised by research team. In AGREEII domains, guideline had the highest score in “Scope and Purpose” (92.7%) and the lowest in “Applicability” (76.2%). About applicability of guideline, 92.9% of nurses reported the positive effect of implementation of guideline recommendations on caring DFU and lack of needed equipment for its implementation.
