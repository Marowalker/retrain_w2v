Paterson BJ, Kirk MD, Cameron AS, et al. Historical data and modern methods reveal insights in measles epidemiology: a retrospective closed cohort study. BMJ Open 2013;3:e002033. There are two errors in this paper:
Under the Results heading of the abstract, the sentence “Measles R0 (95 cases) ranged from 7.7–10.9” should read “Measles R0 (95 cases) ranged from 7.1–10.9”.

In the Results section, page 5, under the heading ‘Basic Reproduction Number’, line 2, the section “being 8.7 and 10.9” should actually be “being 7.1 and 10.9”.
