Smaling HJA, Joling KJ, van de Ven PM, et al. Effects of the Namaste Care Family programme on quality of life of nursing home residents with advanced dementia and on family caregiving experiences: study protocol of a cluster-randomised controlled trial. BMJ Open 2018;8:e025411. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025411.

This article was previously published with the incorrect sentence about the QUALID below.

We used the mean (M) and SD as calculated in previous work validating the Dutch version of the QUALID in nursing home residents with advanced dementia (M=7.5, SD=4.9).41For the PES, it was analysed and provided for the subgroup of family caregivers with dementia (M=2.9, SD=1.9).92


Now, this sentence has been removed and the beginning of the next sentence has been revised as given below:

The mean PES was analysed and provided for the subgroup of family caregivers with dementia (M=2.9, SD=1.9).92
