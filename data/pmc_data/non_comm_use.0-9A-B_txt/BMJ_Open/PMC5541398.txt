There are some errors in the RR and 95% CI values in the Results paragraph of the Abstract. This paragraph should read as follows:

Results
In multinomial logistic regression models adjusting for a range of covariates, the high (vs low) academic ability reduced the risk of persistent cigarette smoking (RR=0.62; CI 95% 0.48 to 0.81) in early adolescence. High (vs low) academic ability increased the risk of occasional (RR=1.25; CI 95% 1.04 to 1.51) and persistent (RR=1.83; CI 95% 1.50 to 2.23) regular alcohol drinking in early adolescence and persistent (RR=2.28; CI 95% 1.84 to 2.82) but not occasional regular alcohol drinking in late adolescence. High (vs low) academic ability was also positively associated with occasional (RR=1.50; CI 95% 1.22 to 1.83) and persistent (RR=1.91; CI 95% 1.57 to 2.34) cannabis use in late adolescence.
