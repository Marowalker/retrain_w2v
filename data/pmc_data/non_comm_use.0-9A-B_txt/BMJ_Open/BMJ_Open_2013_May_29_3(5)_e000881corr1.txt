There is an error in this article which, when reading the article in full, presents conflicting information. The error concerns two percentages, which are correct in the abstract but were transposed in the results section. Under the heading ‘Efficacy’, the second sentence currently reads:

“Three criteria out of four were achieved in the majority of patients, as shown by 97.5%, 73.6% and 69.8% of subjects achieving the criterion of magnitude of effect, tolerance (absence of severe related AEs) and subject's CGI, respectively.”

This sentence should read:

“Three criteria out of four were achieved in the majority of patients, as shown by 73.6%, 97.5% and 69.8% of subjects achieving the criterion of magnitude of effect, tolerance (absence of severe related AEs) and subject's CGI, respectively.”
