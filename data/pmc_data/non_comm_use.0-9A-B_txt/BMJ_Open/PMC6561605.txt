Ivers J, Zgaga L, O’Donoghue-Hynes B, et al. Five-year standardised mortality ratios in a cohort of homeless people in Dublin BMJ Open 2019;9:e023010. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023010

This article was previously published with an error.

Currently on Page 3 in Results, the article reads:

A total of 201 deaths of homeless people, which occurred between 2011 and 2015, were included in the current study (table 1). The median age at death was 42 years (males 44 years and females 36 years).

This should actually read:

A total of 201 deaths of homeless people, which occurred between 2011 and 2015, were included in the current study (table 1). The mean age at death was 42 years (males 44 years and females 36 years). The median is reported later.
