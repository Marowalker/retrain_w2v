1 Introduction
Poultry industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in India. As per the report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Govt. of India, the average growth rate in egg production and broiler production is 8% and 14% per annum, respectively. Various sources of environmental pollutants and microbes are contaminating poultry produce and animal feed (D'Mello, 2004). There are different modes of pathogen transmission in poultry diseases. Transmission of pathogens via the contamination of feed and feed ingredients causes infections in birds thereby leading to low production performance and economic losses. There are many microbes, including Clostridium perfringens, spread through contaminated feed (Tessari et al., 2014).

C. perfringens is a Gram positive, anaerobic, spore-forming, rod shaped bacterium. It is ubiquitous in nature and can be found as a normal component of soil, contaminated food, decaying vegetation, marine sediment, intestinal tract of birds and poultry litter. The C. perfringens type A causes necrotic enteritis (NE) in poultry (Longo et al., 2010, Opengart and Songer, 2013, Moore, 2015), the acute form of the disease causes high mortality in broiler birds (Kaldhusdal and Lovland, 2000), where as the subclinical form causes erosion of intestinal mucosa results in decreased digestion and absorption, depressed weight gain and increased FCR (Kaldhusdal et al., 2001, Hofacre et al., 2003).

Among foodborne diseases in humans, C. perfringens is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens apart from Campylobacter and Salmonella (Buzby and Roberts, 1997).

Poultry feed ingredients contaminated by microorganisms may be considered in relation to the performance of birds and also with the public health significance. With this background, the present study was undertaken to study the occurrence of C. perfringens contamination in poultry feed ingredients.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Samples
From July 2015 to June 2016, a total of 298 poultry feed ingredient samples from different sources received at Poultry Disease Diagnosis and Surveillance Laboratory, Namakkal were screened for the presence of C. perfringens.

2.2 Isolation and identification of C. perfringens
A sample of 50 g feed ingredient was added in 450 mL of distilled water and mixed in a vortex mixer (TARSON) for 15 min. Between each sample preparation, the vortex mixer was cleaned by mopping cloth moistened with 70% isopropyl alcohol. A 50-mL aliquot from the mixture was transferred to a beaker and placed in water bath at 80 °C for 10 min. The mixture was allowed to cool, then 1 mL was inoculated in 10 mL of freshly prepared Robertson's cooked meat medium in Brain Heart Infusion Broth (Himedia, Mumbai) and incubated under anaerobic condition at 37 °C for 24 to 48 h. A loopful of inoculum from the broth was streaked into Perfringens agar plates with supplements (Perfringens supplement I Sodium sulphadiazine), Perfringens supplement II (Oleandomycin phosphate and Polymyxin B sulphate) (Himedia, Mumbai) and incubated under anaerobic condition at 38 to 40 °C for 24 h. The plates were observed for the growth of characteristic colonies of C. perfringens. The suspected colonies were subjected to Gram's staining and biochemical tests for identification and confirmation.

2.3 Stormy fermentation test
Stormy fermentation test as described by Tessari et al. (2014) was performed with slight modifications to identify gas and acid production by C. perfringens. The suspected colony from Perfringens agar was inoculated in 5 mL of litmus milk medium. One millilitre of liquid paraffin was added over the medium to form a layer to produce anaerobiosis. Then the tubes were incubated under anaerobic condition at 37 °C for 14 to 24 h.

2.4 Lecithinase test
The suspected colony from Perfringens agar was streaked on 10% egg yolk agar plate. Then the plates were incubated under anaerobic condition at 37 °C for 24 h.

2.5 Antibiogram assay
Disc diffusion method as described by Bauer et al. (1966) was performed to determine the sensitivity pattern of C. perfringens isolates to various antibiotics. A total of 30 isolates of C. perfringens were subjected to in-vitro antibiogram assay. The antibiotic discs (Himedia, Mumbai) used in this study were gatifloxacin (30 mcg), ciprofloxacin (5 mcg), gentamicin (30 mcg), co-trimoxazole (1.25/23.75 mcg), penicillin G (2 IU), neomycin (10 mcg), ofloxacin (5 mcg), chlortetracycline (30 mcg), lincomycin (15 mcg) and bacitracin (10 units).

3 Results
A total number of 101 C. perfringens isolates were obtained from the 298 feed samples screened. The isolates were confirmed as they produced saccharolytic reaction in Robertson's cooked meat medium in Brain Heart Infusion Broth and typical black line over the roughed edged white colonies on Perfringens agar. Smears made from individual colonies revealed Gram positive, spore forming and large sized rods by Gram staining. The isolates produced typical stormy fermentation reaction in litmus milk medium and they also produced a zone of opalescence around the colonies in egg yolk agar (Fig. 1). Thus, the isolates were identified as C. perfringens on the basis of their cultural, morphological and biochemical characteristics.Fig. 1 Lecithinase activity of Clostridium perfringens in egg yolk agar.

Fig. 1

Among the 101 C. perfringens isolates obtained from the feed samples the overall positivity was 33.89% (Table 1). The highest level of C. perfringens contamination was observed in fish meal (55.26%) followed by bone meal (44.83%), meat and bone meal (42.86%) and dry fish (38.46%).Table 1 Isolation of Clostridium perfringens from various poultry feed ingredients.

4 Discussion
The presence of C. perfringens in feed is directly correlated with the level of faecal and soil contamination (Wojdat et al., 2006). High protein contents in poultry feed seems to increase the incidence of C. perfringens infection. Animal protein ingredients such as fishmeal or meat and bone meal in poultry feed increased the risk of necrotic enteritis in poultry (Kocher, 2003, Wu et al., 2014).

Out of 298 poultry feed ingredients analysed, C. perfringens was detected in 33.89% of samples. The highest level of contamination with C. perfringens was observed in fish meal (55.26%) followed by bone meal (44.83%), meat and bone meal (42.86%) and dry fish (38.46%) and all of these are high protein meals of animal origin. The lowest level of C. perfringens contamination was noticed in vegetable protein sources soya meal, maize and rape seed meal. But due to the very low number of samples tested, it is difficult to draw a solid conclusion to say that vegetable protein sources in general have low C. perfringens contamination.

Similar to the present study, several studies have been carried out to determine C. perfringens contamination in poultry feed ingredients. Richardson (2008) found similar levels of C. perfringens contamination in different poultry feed ingredients. Wojdat et al. (2006) detected C. perfringens in 38% of the ingredients used in broiler feed production, with the highest level of contamination in fish meal and meat meal. Schocken-Iturrino et al. (2010) observed 42% of broiler feed samples were contaminated by C. perfringens.

The current study found that fish meal, bone meal and meat and bone meal were the important sources of C. perfringens contamination. Since C. Perfringens is a normal micro flora of soil, contamination of raw feed materials with soil, dust or from workers during drying is practically unavoidable (Mcclane, 2004).

The antibiotic sensitivity pattern in this study revealed the C. perfringens isolates were 100% sensitive to Gentamicin followed by 96.67% to Chlortetracycline, 93.33% to gatifloxacin, 86.67% to ciprofloxacin, 86.67% to ofloxacin and 86.67% to lincomycin. A low level of susceptibility was observed to neomycin (20%), cotrimazine (6.67%) and bacitracin (6.67%). All the isolates were resistant to penicillin-G. Agarwal et al., 2009, Mehtaz et al., 2013 and Ibrahim et al. (2001) found that similar antibiotic sensitive patterns where the C. perfringens isolates were found to be sensitive to fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.

Algammal and Elfeil (2015) found 100% resistance of C. perfringens to Neomycin which is a commonly used antimicrobial drug to treat bacterial enteritis in poultry. But in our study 20% of isolates showed sensitivity to Neomycin. Sulfonamide-Trimethoprim is another drug commonly used for the treatment of respiratory diseases in poultry. In this study only 6.67% of the isolates were sensitive to Co-Trimoxazole and agrees with the findings of Llanco et al. (2012) and Eldin et al. (2015).

In our study, none of the isolates was shown sensitivity to Penicillin-G. Where as, Algammal and Elfeil (2015) and Gad et al. (2011) recorded a high level of sensitivity of C. perfringens to Penicillin. The difference in the pattern of sensitivity as resistant to Penicillin-G might be due to indiscriminate use of the drug in poultry industry.

5 Conclusion
C. perfringens contamination was found to be high in animal protein sources used in poultry feed under tropical climatic conditions. The highest level of C. perfringens contamination was detected in fish meal followed by bone meal, meat and bone meal and dry fish purchased from different sources. The C. perfringens isolates showed varying degree of sensitivity to commonly used antibiotics like Gentamicin, Chlortetracycline, Lincomycin and Fluoroquinolones and resistance to Penicillin-G. This study also further warns that extensive surveillance of C. perfringens in poultry feed ingredients and formulate suitable alternative strategies to control this organism in poultry feed.
