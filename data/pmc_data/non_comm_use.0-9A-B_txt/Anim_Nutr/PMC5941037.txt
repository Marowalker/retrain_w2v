A total of 192 Arbor Acre broiler chickens (one-day-old) were randomly divided into 4 treatments with 6 replicates of 8 chickens. These 4 diets were formulated by adding 0, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg AAE to the basal diet. The results showed as follows: 1) compared with the control, the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in ileum for the 2,000 mg/kg treatment group was significantly increased at 21 days of age (P < 0.05); the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly increased in broilers supplemented with 500 mg/kg AAE at 42 days of age (P < 0.05), and the T-AOC levels in jejunum and ileum were significantly improved in 1,000 mg/kg treatment group (P < 0.01). 2) At 21 days of age, supplementation of 500 mg/kg AAE significantly increased the catalase (CAT) activity of small intestine, and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity of jejunum was improved (P < 0.01), meanwhile, the GSH-Px activity of duodenum and the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity of duodenum and jejunum were significantly higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05); supplementation of 1,000 mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT activity of duodenum and ileum and the GSH-Px activity of duodenum and jejunum (P < 0.05), and the ileum GSH-Px activity was significantly increased (P < 0.01); supplementation of 2,000 mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT activity of duodenum and ileum (P < 0.05). At 42 days of age, supplementation of 500 mg/kg AAE significantly increased the GSH-Px activity of ileum and the T-SOD activity of duodenum (P < 0.05), meanwhile, the T-SOD activity of jejunum was significantly increased (P < 0.01); supplementation of 1,000 mg/kg AAE significantly increased the CAT activity of jejunum and the T-SOD activity of ileum (P < 0.01), and the GSH-Px activity of jejunum was significantly increased (P < 0.05); supplementation of 2,000 mg/kg AAE significantly increased the T-SOD activity of ileum (P < 0.05), but significantly decreased the CAT activity of ileum and the GSH-Px activity of jejunum (P < 0.05). 3) The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of 3 AAE supplementation groups were significantly decreased at 21 and 42 days of age (P < 0.05). The results suggested that dietary supplementation with AAE could improve the antioxidative capacity of small intestine in broilers.

1 Introduction
The small intestine is the main organ and place in the digestion and absorption of broiler. Nutrients and water enter the blood and lymph circulation through the intestinal epithelial cells. Therefore, the integrity of the intestinal epithelial cell structure and function is very important to the chicken. However, with the aging of the body, the immunologic function declined and antioxidant capacity gradually weakened from 21 to 42 days in the growth of broiler, resulting in the body's new metabolic dysfunction, free radicals generated excess (Shen and Wang, 2000). When free radicals generated too much or radical scavenging ability declined, accumulation of oxygen free radicals will attack on biofilm polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to lipid peroxidation, producing metabolites malondialdehyde – malondialdehyde (MDA). However, the MDA can cause proteins, nucleic acids and other vital macromolecules cross-linked polymer, and damage the cell membrane fluidity and permeability, thereby enabling the normal function of membrane damage (Guo et al., 2007).

Artemisia argyi, also known as medical grass, Artemisia argyi grass, perennial herbaceous plants of Compositae artemisia, widely distributed in most areas of our country. Artemisia argyi likes warm and wet conditions, born in the wild land margin, having strong cold and drought resistance. Artemisia argyi grows best in fertile and rich humus place (Zhang et al., 2006). Artemisia argyi contains many kinds of bioactive composition such as volatile oil, flavonoids, eudesmane and triterpene (Zhou et al., 2000), also contains polyunsaturated fatty acid, total phenols matter, vitamin C and essential amino acids (Kim et al., 2015). Studies have reported that Artemisia argyi has strong antioxidative and free radical scavenging capacity (Wu, 2010, Tan et al., 2012; Wu and Extraction, 2008). Wu (2010) reported that dried Folium Artemisia argy and fresh mugwort volatile oil within the range of test concentrations enhanced ability of scavenging the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (·DPPH), hydroxyl radical (·OH) and superoxide anion free radical (O2−), and fresh Artemisia argyi essential oil has a stronger ability of scavenging free radical. Hu et al. (2015) demonstrated that different concentrations of Artemisia argyi polysaccharide has the ability to remove ·OH, O2− and ·DPPH, and between the clearance rate and concentration there is a dose-dependent manner. Wu and Sun (2008) illustrated that flavonoids of Artemisia argyi can effectively remove the H2O2, O2− and ·OH, and its antioxidant effect is much higher than that of vitamin C. In addition, Chu et al. (2015) reported that broilers supplemented with 1,000 mg/kg Artemisia argyi aqueous extract (AAE) can improve the serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum decreased. Thus it can be seen that Artemisia argyi antioxidation research mainly concentrate on the volatile oil, polysaccharide, flavonoids and other active ingredients, and AAE on antioxidant research is very rare. Especially, the effect of AAE on antioxidant function of intestinal tissue has not been reported. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of different levels of AAE on antioxidant function of broiler's small intestine, and hope to determine the appropriate supplemental dosage level of AAE in broiler diet.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Materials
Fresh green Artemisia argyi was collected from Huhhot in July. All plants were washed with distilled water and dried at room temperature in the shade. The plant was extracted with distilled water, the extraction was concentrated and lyophilized to obtain the powder, stored at −20 °C. The dose used in the experiment was calculated by air dry powder.

2.2 Experiment design and management
This experiment was used single factorial random experiment, a total of 192 Arbor Acre (AA) broiler chickens (one-day-old) were randomly divided into 4 treatments by initial body weight and sex, and each treatment had 6 replicates with 8 chickens (4 females and 4 males) each. These 4r diets were formulated by adding AAE of 0, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 mg/kg to basal diets. The experiment lasted 42 days, containing 2 periods with 21 days each.

2.3 Basal diet and nutrition level
The basal diet was formulated according to the nutrient requirements recommended by the NY/T 33-2004 (Agricultural Industry Standards of People's Republic of China) for broilers and actual situation in Inner Mongolia, its composition and nutritional levels are shown in Table 1.Table 1 Composition and nutrient levels of basal diet (air-dry basis, %).

2.4 Feeding and management
The feeding experiment was carried out in Inner Mongolia Agricultural University. The start of the experiment, chicken house, the surrounding environment and test equipment had carried out strict disinfection. Experimental diets and water were available ad libitum during the experimental period. A total of 192 Arbor Acre (AA) broiler chickens (one-day-old) of similar body weight were selected and randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments with 6 replicate cages of 8 chicks per cage. Each cage was 100 cm × 100 cm (1 m2 per 8 birds). The temperature was set at 36 °C during the first day, 34 °C during the first week, and was gradually reduced by 3 °C per week to reach a minimum 22 °C at 28 days of age. Relative humidity was between 65% and 75%. During the whole experiment period, air ventilation schedule was maintained. The experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Animal Care and Use Committee of Inner Mongolia Agricultural University.

2.5 Sample collection and processing
2.5.1 Sample collection
Two broilers were chosen randomly from each replicate group at 21 and 42 day of age which had approximately average weight of the group, and the birds were slaughtered by bleeding the left jugular vein. With medical alcohol cleaning and disinfection of the chest and abdomen, the duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissue were removed. After rinsing clean with physiological saline, the samples were packaged with tin foil paper and stored at −20 °C until analysis of antioxidant index.

2.5.2 Sample processing
The duodenum, jejunum and ileum, which were approximately 3 cm in the middle segment, were taken and rinsed clean with the precooling physiological saline. After filter paper bloted, the samples were accurately weighed and prepared into nine times volume of physiological saline, made of 10% tissue homogenate grinding and slurry at low temperatures. The samples were centrifuged at 1,346 g for 10 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was removed and stored at −20 °C until analysis of antioxidant index.

2.6 Testing index and method
Total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and Total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) were measured using commercial assay kits provided by Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute: Xanthine oxidase method; GSH-Px: DTNB direct chromatometry; CAT: Ammonium molybdate method; MDA: TBA method), and the total protein content was determined by Coomassie brilliant blue method.

2.7 Statistical analysis
The data were preliminary collated by Excel 2007, and the 4 treatment means were compared by ANOVA, using the Duncan's multiple range tests, and P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, and P < 0.01 was considered to be extremely significant difference.

4 Disscussion
4.1 Effects of AAE on the level of T-AOC of small intestine in broilers
Total antioxidant capacity is a main index to measure the total antioxidant level of enzymatic system and non-enzymatic system (Wang et al., 2009). Its antioxidant role mainly through three ways: 1) elimination of free radicals and reactive oxygen species to prevent lipid peroxidation; 2) degradation of peroxidation products and blocking the oxidative chain; 3) removal of metal ions from the catalytic reaction. The present experiment showed that the diets containing AAE can improve the total antioxidant capacity of small intestine in broiler, and the 1,000 mg/kg treatment group had the highest level of small intestine T-AOC at 42 days of age. However, there are not a lot of reports about the effects of Artemisia plants on total antioxidant capacity of small intestine in broilers. This finding may be caused from Artemisia argyi containing bioactive substances, such as flavonoids (Wu and Extraction, 2008) and polysaccharides (Lan et al., 2010, Xiong, 2011) which can remove excess free radicals of intestine tissue and raise the T-AOC level of small intestine and protect the normal function of the small intestine epithelial cells.

4.2 Effects of AAE on antioxidant enzyme activity of small intestine in broilers
Catalase, total superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase are not only the main antioxidant enzymes that can removal the super oxygen free radical, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, but also can reduce or prevent the formation of free radicals (Wang et al., 2012). In the process of animal metabolism, O2− production and cleaning is a process of dynamic equilibrium. The elimination of O2− is completely dependent on the whole antioxidant defense system of the body (Wang, 2010). Super oxygen anion and hydrogen ions generated hydrogen peroxide under the action of SOD; and then hydrogen peroxide eventually turns into H2O under the action of CAT or GSH-Px. Therefore, the synergistic effect of SOD and CAT or GSH-Px can effectively eliminate free radicals. The experimental results showed that diets supplemented with AAE can improve the antioxidant enzymes activity (CAT, T-SOD and GSH-Px), and consequently improve antioxidant capacity of small intestinal tissue. This means that AAE is a kind of effective free radical scavenger that can enhance the antioxidant capacity of small intestinal tissue. This may because of Artemisia argyi containing bioactive substances, such as flavonoids materials and polysaccharide has the very good radical scavenging capacity and antioxidant effect (Wu and Extraction, 2008, Lan et al., 2010).

The results of the above experiments were in agreement with previous studies. Chu et al. (2015) illustrated that the diets containing 1,000 mg/kg AAE improved the SOD activity in broiler chickens. Zhang et al. (2011) reported that added Artemisia japonica extract (AJE) improved the GSH-Px and SOD activity of liver in mice. He et al. (2009) concluded that Artemisia argyi volatile oil can enhance the serum SOD activity in mice. In addition, Repetto et al. (2003) demonstrated that Dow moxa extracts showed significant antioxidant effect in vitro and in vivo. Huh et al. (2003) illustrated that oral administration of 40 mg/kg DA-9601 (a kind of alcohol extract of artemisia Asia) can significantly reduce alcohol induced rat gastrointestinal mucosa hemorrhagic injury and lipid peroxidation.

4.3 Effect of AAE on the MDA content of small intestine in broilers
Malondialdehyde is an animal body end product of lipid peroxidation that can cause proteins, nucleic acids and other vital macromolecules cross-linked polymer, and has cytotoxicity, meanwhile, its content can reflect the degree of cell damage. The present experiment showed that diets containing AAE significantly reduced the MDA content of small intestine in broilers. With the increase of AAE dosage, MDA content in small intestine tissue decreased. This means that the AAE can effectively reduce the lipid peroxidation, and protect the normal function of the small intestine. This finding was in agreement with the results of Qiao et al. (2011) and Chu et al. (2015).

5 Conclusion
The test results showed that feeding AAE increased the antioxidant capabilities of small intestine tissue in broilers. At 21 days of age, supplementation of ​ 500 mg/kg AAE improved the intestinal tissue antioxidant enzymes activity, especially the activity of CAT. At 42 days of age, the antioxidant function of small intestinal in 1,000 mg/kg group had the best promotion effect.
