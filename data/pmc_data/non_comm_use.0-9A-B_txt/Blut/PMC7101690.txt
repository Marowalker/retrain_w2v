Eight neutropenic patients with acute lymphocytic or nonlymphocytic leukemia had septicemia due to different strains ofStreptococcus mitis (St. mitis), a microorganism not commonly recognized as a special pathogen in leukemic patients. Four of the patients had been treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside as part of the cytostatic regimen, six had a central venous line and four patients had oral lesions prior to the infection. Selective gut decontamination consisted of co-trimoxazole/colistin in five patients and quinolones in three patients. The first three patients died, either due to interstitial pneumonia with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or due to infection-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation despite prompt empiric antibiotic therapy including vancomycin. The other patients improved after empiric supplementation of penicillin G (30 Mega/day) to the antibiotic regimen. Beginning ARDS in two of these patients dramatically responded to high-dose steriods. We conclude thatSt. mitis is a major pathogen in neutropenic leukemic patients. Infection appears to occur independently of acute leukemic cell type, regimen of selective gut decontamination, venous access, visible oral lesions or treatment with highdose cytosine arabinoside. The clinical course of our patients raises questions about the value of commonly recommended empiric antibiotic regimens, which were clearly ineffective to control infections withSt. mitis in this patient group. Our data indicate that immediate antibiotic therapy with penicillin G is indicated and may be life-saving for suspectedSt. mitis infections in neutropenic leukemic patients.
