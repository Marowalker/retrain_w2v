However, their long-term incidence compared with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)
is lacking. In-hospital and long-term incidence of thromboembolic events of 138
consecutive patients with TTS were compared with 138 sex- and age-matched
patients with ACS. Predictors of events were analyzed. The incidence of
thromboembolic events in TTS was 2-fold higher than ACS (21% vs 9%;
P < .01) over a mean follow-up of 5 years. Although the
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at event was significantly lower in
TTS compared with ACS (38% [9%] vs 54% [11%]; P < .01), the
follow-up LVEF was comparable. Patients with TTS suffering from thromboembolic
events were more often treated with anticoagulation compared with ACS (44.8% vs
8.3%, P = .03). However, more patients presenting with ACS
(100% vs 48.3%; P < .01) were discharged on aspirin. Only
elevated C-reactive protein was a predictor of thromboembolic events using
multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.2;
P < .01). In conclusion, the risk of thromboembolic
events in TTS was significantly higher than the risk of thromboembolic events in
ACS over a mean follow-up of 5 years.

==== Body
Introduction
Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has been associated with a favorable prognosis.1–4 However, different complications have been reported in TTS, including sudden
cardiac arrest, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, cardiogenic shock, and
mitral valve regurgitation.5–9 Although the detailed pathophysiology of TTS is lacking, a role of
catecholamine excess and estradiol protective effect have been debated.10–12 Recently published data showed a protective effect of estradiol using human
cardiomyocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells.2,11

The incidence and clinical significance of thromboembolic events in TTS has not yet
been clearly established. Data documenting these events are scarce; the recent
literature highlights an incidence of 2% to 11%.13–18 Moreover, the long-term incidence of thromboembolic events compared with
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is lacking.

In the present study, we determined the incidence of thromboembolic events in TTS
compared with ACS in-hospital and over a 5-year follow-up. Additionally, predictors
of thromboembolic events were evaluated.

Methods
Data of consecutive patients presenting with TTS from 2003 to 2017 were included in
the study retrospectively and prospectively (TTS group). Takotsubo syndrome was
defined by the Mayo clinic criteria.19 To assess the diagnosis of TTS, the angiograms, echocardiograms, and
electrocardiograms were reviewed by 2 independent experienced cardiologists. Data of
patients who presented from 2007 to 2010 with ACS (non-ST-segment-elevation
myocardial infarction or ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) in the Clinic
for Cardiology, University Hospital Mannheim and who were subsequently treated with
percutaneous coronary intervention and stent implantation were assessed from the
department’s database. Of the >500 patients, a group of patients with ACS was
matched to the patients with TTS by age and sex, resulting in 138 patients with
either disease. Baseline characteristics of demographic and clinical data were
assessed by chart review, as were in-hospital events (arrhythmias, cardiac rupture,
thromboembolic events, pulmonary congestion with use of noninvasive positive
pressure ventilation, intubation, use of a temporary pacemaker, use of inotropic
agents, and death). Patients with ACS were followed up retrospectively.

This study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study
protocol was approved by the ethics committee of University Medical Centre
Mannheim.

Study End Point
The endpoint of the study was the occurrence of thromboembolic events in patients
with TTS compared with patients with ACS. Additionally, outcomes including
all-cause mortality, life-threatening arrhythmia, heart failure, respiratory
failure, and use of respiratory support were assessed by chart review and/or
telephone review. If information concerning the circumstances of death could not
be retrieved by medical records or the treating physicians, it was defined as
death due to unknown cause.

Statistics
Data are shown as means (standard deviation) for continuous variables with a
normal distribution, median (interquartile range) for continuous variables with
a non-normal distribution, and as frequency (%) for categorical variables. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to assess normal distribution. Normally or
non-normally distributed continuous variables were compared with Student
t test and Mann-Whitney U test,
respectively. Categorical variables were compared by χ2 test or
Fisher exact test. Two-tailed Fisher exact test was applied in tests with sample
size of n = 5 or below. Fisher exact ratio test was used for calculation of the
relative risk for the occurrence of events. Results are shown with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs). The Kaplan-Meier procedure was performed to evaluate
group differences by log-rank test. Independent predictors for thromboembolic
events were determined by univariate analysis. Predictors with
P <.10 were subsequently entered into the Cox
multivariate regression analysis. Results are described as hazard ratios with
95% CI. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 23.0; a P
<.05 (2 tailed) was considered significant.

Results
Patients with ACS suffered more often from chest pain compared with those with TTS
(83% vs 38%; Table 1).
Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients with TTS compared with
patients with ACS (134 [62-220] mm Hg vs 159 [120-205] mm Hg); heart rate was
significantly higher in patients with TTS (100 [25] beats/min vs 73 [13] beats/min).
ST-segment elevation and inverted T waves were significantly more common in patients
TTS compared with patients with ACS. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
was significantly lower in TTS compared with ACS (38% [9%] vs 54% [11%]). However,
follow-up LVEF was comparable in both groups. Additionally, mitral regurgitation and
tricuspid regurgitation were more common in patients with TTS compared with patients
with ACS.

In-Hospital Complications
Life-threatening arrhythmia, inotropic agents, resuscitation, in-hospital death,
and cardiogenic shock were similar in both patients with TTS and ACS. However,
respiratory failure and need of respiratory support were significantly higher in
patients with TTS compared with patients with ACS (51.7% vs 8.3%; Table 2).

Discussion
We have described the short- and long-term incidence of thromboembolic events in TTS
from our hospital in comparison with a sex- and age-matched ACS population.

(i) Patients with TTS suffered more often from thromboembolic events compared with
patients with ACS; (ii) more patients with TTS are at high risk of thromboembolic
events over long-term outcome with a predominance of stroke; and (iii) CRP is an
independent predictor of thromboembolic events.

Thromboembolism is a relevant complication of TTS. Defined by events such as a
stroke, the formation of ventricular thrombi, and peripheral embolization, these can
present at any time in the disease course. In the present study, we sought to
determine the epidemiological as well as the clinical aspects of thromboembolic
events in TTS compared with ACS.

Predominantly, postmenopausal women are affected by TTS, which is usually provoked by
emotional or physical stress.3,10 An enhanced sympathetic activity with an elevation in catecholamine levels
has been documented in these patients and debated as a possible mechanism for the
pathophysiology of TTS.12,20 Nevertheless, a defining explanation of the underlying pathogenesis remains
unresolved. In general, a ventricular thrombus can occur in the setting of
ventricular dysfunction, especially in the acute stage after ACS, or different
cardiomyopathies/dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, the risk of thromboembolic
event is increased in patients with noncompaction cardiomyopathy (characterized
anatomically by prominent left ventricular (LV) trabeculae and deep intratrabecular
recesses), and therefore, an effective anticoagulation therapy is required.21–26

The low blood flow in heart chambers may explain the development of thromboembolic
events in patients with TTS. It is known that recovery of LV function might be
achieved within 2 weeks after TTS events. The improvement in wall motion abnormality
in TTS might promote discharge of an intraventricular thrombus into the peripheral
bloodstream, thus initiating an embolic event and stroke. However, recently
published data showing an altered coagulation system in patients with TTS contribute
to its role in the development of thromboembolic events in patients with TTS.27 Several endothelial markers, clotting activation biomarkers (von Willebrand
factor and plasminogen), and lipoprotein a levels were higher in patients with TTS
as compared with the healthy population, suggesting a role of endothelial
dysfunction and similar pathologies contributing to the hyperviscosity of blood flow
in TTS.28 One potential explanation for the high rate of thromboembolic events in TTS
compared with ACS might be due to the fact that the recovery from impaired LV
function is much earlier than in the setting of an ACS. However, in the long term,
the risk of thromboembolism is higher in TTS compared with ACS. At the same time,
our data showed a higher rate of cancer in patients with TTS compared with patients
with ACS over follow-up.27 This might suggest the mechanism of thromboembolic events in TTS over years
of follow-up.

Remarkably, in the present study, only 30% of patients with TTS suffering from
thromboembolic events have shown a ventricular thrombus formation. Two-dimensional
echocardiogram and transesophageal echocardiogram remain the gold standard to
diagnose thrombus formation. However, operator skills and use of contrast agents may
all influence the sensitivity and specificity of this tool in thrombus detection.
Although intraventricular thrombus formation might usually be in the LV apex, other
possible sites including papillary muscles should be looked for.16 Even more, it has been reported that thrombus formation is a common finding
in the right ventricle, especially in TTS cases with right ventricular involvement.28 Additionally, in rare cases, tumor or thrombus formation may challenge
physicians, leading to overlooking thrombus formation.29,30 In rare cases, the use of computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance
imaging might be required to rule out intraventricular thrombus.

In the present study, patients suffering from TTS were less often treated with
aspirin at discharge. A review of the current literature reveals that most patients
with TTS suffering from thrombus formation have been treated with anticoagulants
such as warfarin and/or heparin. However, the type of anticoagulant drug prescribed
was variable and details as to the dosage and therapy duration were often not
reported. Although in the present study patients with TTS were more discharged with
a temporary anticoagulation, this might not prevent long-term thromboembolic events.
Although anticoagulation therapy in the presence of LV thrombus is recommended, a
retrospective study has recommended antiplatelet therapy during index
hospitalization to prevent this complication.31 Due to the retrospective character of current data and sparse reports of the
long-term use of antiplatelet therapy in patients with TTS, this topic needs future
prospective multicenter studies.

Conclusions
The risk of thromboembolic events in TTS is significantly higher at TTS presentation
and even more after 5-year follow-up when compared with patients with ACS. An
elevated CRP level might be a predictor of thromboembolic events. Prospective
studies are warranted to define the real risk of thromboembolic events in TTS and to
develop an algorithm for the treatment of these events.

Study Limitations
The present study is a retrospective, single-center study. It is possible that the
thromboembolic event rate was underestimated. A further point is the therapeutic
approach at discharge. It is possible that some patients with TTS discontinued their
treatment.
