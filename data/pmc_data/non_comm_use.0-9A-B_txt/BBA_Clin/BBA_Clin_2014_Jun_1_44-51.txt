Listeria monocytogenes meningitis is the third most common cause of bacterial meningitis and is associated with high rates of mortality and unfavorable outcome.

Methods
We analyzed 101 cytokines, chemokines and complement factors in CSF of adult patients with Listeria meningitis included in a prospective cohort study and compared these biomarkers between Listeria meningitis patients and negative controls, and between Listeria meningitis patients with a favorable and an unfavorable outcome.

Results
CSF was available from 26 of 62 (42%) Listeria meningitis patients and 19 negative controls. Fifteen (58%) Listeria meningitis patients had an unfavorable outcome. In Listeria meningitis CSF levels of 51 biomarkers were significantly elevated compared to negative controls after Bonferroni correction. The 11 most significantly elevated (P < .01) biomarkers of unfavorable outcome in Listeria meningitis were markers of T-cell activation (sIL-2Rα, sCD40L and IL-1), interferon-related (IFN-α2, IL-18, CX3CL1, CCL20), markers of complement activation (C3a), and endothelial growth factor related (VEGF, CXCL7).

Conclusions
Our data suggest that T-cell activation, complement activation, interferon- and endothelial growth factor production are important in the immune response to Listeria meningitis, and thereby influence outcome.

General significance
Our study provides target pathways for further studies in the pathophysiology of Listeria meningitis.

Highlights
• CSF biomarkers were studied in Listeria meningitis.

• CSF T-cell activation markers were associated with outcome.

• Interferon-related CSF biomarkers were associated with outcome.

• C3a, VEGF, and CXCL7 were associated with outcome.

1 Introduction
Bacterial meningitis is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis in 85% of cases [1,2]. Listeria monocytogenes is the third most common cause of bacterial meningitis (identified in 6% of cases) and is associated with high mortality and rate of unfavorable outcome [3,4]. Listeria meningitis is predominantly found in elderly and immunocompromised patients, but also occurs in previous healthy adults [5,6]. In an explorative study we assess the associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers and outcome in Listeria meningitis.

2 Materials and methods
We identified adults (> 16 years of age) who had Listeria meningitis established by positive CSF culture and were listed in the database of the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial Meningitis (NRLBM) from March 2006 to April 2012. This laboratory receives CSF isolates from approximately 85% of all patients with bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands. Patients or their legal representatives received written information concerning the study and were asked to give written informed consent for participation. Patients with negative CSF cultures, hospital-acquired bacterial meningitis, or neurosurgical devices, and those within 1 month following neurosurgical procedure or neurotrauma, were excluded. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Online case record forms were used to collect data on clinical features, complications, treatment and outcome in adults with meningitis. Patients with an altered immune status owing to splenectomy, diabetes mellitus, cancer, alcoholism or the use of immunosuppressive drugs were considered immunocompromised, as were patients infected with HIV. Neurological examination was performed at discharge and outcome was scored according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale. This measurement scale is well validated, with scores varying from 1 (death) to 5 (good recovery) [7]. A favorable outcome was defined as a score of 5, and an unfavorable outcome was defined as a score of 1–4.

In patients with Listeria meningitis, residual CSF from the diagnostic lumbar puncture was collected, centrifuged, and supernatant was aliquoted and stored at − 80 °C until analysis. Control CSF samples were collected from 19 patients in whom a lumbar puncture was performed to rule out sub-arachnoid hemorrhage in patients eventually diagnosed with benign thunderclap headache. All these CSF samples had normal leukocyte count, total protein level and glucose concentration (Appendix A1). CSF cytokine, chemokine and complement factor concentrations were determined with Luminex technology using a Milliplex MAP assay, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA. For complement component C3a, iC3b, C5a and sC5b-9 levels the Microvue C3a, iC3b, C5a and sC5b-9 Quidel ELISA kits, Quidel, San Diego, USA were used. CSF complement component levels of C1q and MBL were measured using the Hycult ELISA kits, Hycult Biotech, Uden, the Netherlands and PAI-2 was measured using the USCN ELISA kit, USCN Life Sciences, Hubei, China.

Cytokine, chemokine and complement factor levels were compared between negative controls and patients with Listeria meningitis and subsequently between patients with Listeria meningitis with an unfavorable outcome and those with a favorable outcome. The Mann–Whitney U-test was used to examine associations between cytokine, chemokine and complement factor levels between groups. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and for differences between negative controls and patients a Bonferroni corrected p-Value below < .00051 was considered significant. In the comparison between patients with a favorable and unfavorable outcome the limited number of patients prevented correction for multiple testing. Therefore, we described biomarkers with P value < .01. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 19.0.

3 Results
From March 2006 to April 2012, 62 patients with Listeria meningitis were identified of 1032 included episodes of bacterial meningitis (6%). CSF was available for 26 patients (42%), with median age of 68 years (interquartile range [IQR] 57–74). Patients for whom CSF was available had higher scores on the Glasgow Coma Scale on admission compared to those in whom CSF was not available (GCS 14 [IQR 11–15] vs. 11 [IQR 10–14], P = .03); other clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcome were comparable between patients with and without CSF available.

Table 1 shows the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 26 patients with CSF available. The majority was male (77%) and 15 patients (58%) had an immunocompromised state. Three patients (13%) were not immunocompromised and were 50 years old or younger. Median CSF leukocyte count was 766 cells/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 255–2047), protein level of 2.4 g/L (IQR 1.8–3.8) and CSF to blood glucose ratio of 0.27 (IQR 0.16–0.39). Adjunctive dexamethasone treatment was started with or before the first dose of antibiotics in 14 patients (54%) according to the standard regimen of 10 mg every 6 h for 4 days. Data on diagnostic sequence of cranial CT, lumbar puncture and initiation of treatment were available for 20 patients. In 19 patients a cranial CT was made prior to the lumbar puncture, and in only 6 the antibiotic treatment was initiated before the CT. Fifteen patients (58%) had an unfavorable outcome and 6 (23%) died.

Because of limited amounts of cerebrospinal fluid not all assays could be performed for all patients: sufficient CSF to assess 46 analytes was available from all 26 patients and 19 controls. The other 55 analytes were tested in 19–25 patients and 13–18 controls (Appendix A2). Out of 101 analytes, 10 (10%) were below the lower limit of detection in all patient and control samples (IL-9, CCL1, CCL21, IL-33, LIF, TPO, TSLP, MMP-12, MMP-13 and MMP-7). For 21 analytes (21%) the protein concentration was below the lower limit of detection in all negative control samples, but detectable concentrations were present in Listeria meningitis patients. Compared to negative controls, 51 of the 101 (50%) cytokines, chemokines and complement factors were significantly elevated in patients with Listeria meningitis after Bonferroni correction (< 0.00051) for multiple testing.

We identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; P = .001, Appendix A3, Fig. 1), and (Appendix A4) complement component C3a (P = .002), soluble interleukin receptor antagonist a2 (sIL-2Rα; P = .002), chemokine (C–X–C motif) ligand 7 (CXCL7; P = .003), CX3CL1 (P = .003), CCL11 (P = .005), interferon alpha2 (IFN-α2; P = .005), chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20; P = .007), interleukin 12 subunit p40 (IL-12p40; P = .008), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L; P = .008) and interleukin 18 (IL-18; P = .008) as the top 11 cytokines, chemokines and complement factors with the strongest association (P < .01) with unfavorable outcome in patients with Listeria meningitis.

No differences in CSF biomarker levels were identified when comparing patients in whom the lumbar puncture was performed before or after parenteral antibiotics.

4 Discussion
In our explorative study we assessed 101 cytokines, chemokines and complement factors and found that VEGF, C3a, sIL-2Rα, CXCL7, CX3CL1, CCL11, IFN-α2, CCL20, IL-12p40, IL-18, and sCD40L were most significantly different between Listeria meningitis patients with an unfavorable and those with a favorable outcome. These differences in protein levels may reflect important pathways in the pathophysiology of Listeria meningitis contributing to disease severity. VEGF, sIL-2Rα, C3a and IFN-α2 have previously been identified to be involved in the host defense mechanisms against L. monocytogenes
[8–12].

VEGF is a growth factor and an angiogenic cytokine which is expressed intracellularly in several cell types, such as macrophages, inside which L. monocytogenes replicate [8,13]. In vitro experiments have previously shown that VEGF levels in RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells were elevated following stimulation with heat-killed L. monocytogenes
[9]. Furthermore, an in vivo model showed elevated expression of VEGF in splenic macrophages in mice with L. monocytogenes compared to negative controls [14]. This production of VEGF is induced by CXCL7 [14], which was also elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome. VEGF has been shown to induce endothelial changes during bacterial meningitis in patients and disrupt the blood brain barrier in a rat model [15]; thereby increasing brain inflammation and oedema. Elevated VEGF levels, mediated by CXCL7, could result in increased brain damage in patients explaining the increased rate of unfavorable outcome.

C3a is an anaphylatoxin, causing attraction of phagocytic cells, recruits antibodies and initiates the adaptive immune response [16]. A study on the role of the complement in L. monocytogenes infections showed that listerial opsonization mainly depended on the classical complement pathway [17]. Following opsonization, activation of the final common pathway results in conversion of C3 to C3a and C3b [10,16]. The degree of complement activation has previously been shown to influence outcome in pneumococcal meningitis by aggravating brain damage [18]. In a pneumococcal meningitis mouse model inhibition of complement factor 5 was shown to improve outcome [18]. The elevated C3a levels in patients with unfavorable outcome suggest that complement activation is detrimental in Listeria meningitis as well. Whether complement inhibition is a successful strategy in Listeria meningitis is an interesting topic for experimental studies.

Several proteins that were elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome were involved in T-cell activation. We observed elevated levels of sIL-2Rα, sCD40L and IL-12p40 in patients with an unfavorable outcome indicating a strong T-cell activation, which has been shown to be crucial in the immune response to L. monocytogenes in mouse models [19]. Activated T-cells express high affinity receptors for interleukin-2, which plays an important role during proliferation of T-lymphocytes. This IL-2-receptor alpha is also released in a soluble form (sIL-2Ra), which is considered to be an important marker of continuous T-cell activation [20,21]. Another protein in the activation of T-cells which was elevated in patients with an unfavorable outcome is sCD40L, which is a member of the TNF family and results in T-cell priming following infection with L. monocytogenes
[22]. IL-12p40 is important for sustaining a sufficient number of memory/effector Th1 cells to mediate long-term protection to intracellular pathogens, and acts on T-cells and natural killer cells, which are both essential to combat L. monocytogenes infection [23].

Other proteins that were identified to be elevated in patients with unfavorable outcome were interferon (IFN-α2) or interferon-related (IL-18, CX3CL1, CCL20). Type 1 interferons, which include interferon alpha, have been shown to have a deleterious effect during L. monocytogenes infection by decreasing the viability of infected macrophages [23,24]. The increased levels of IFN-α2 in patients with an unfavorable outcome concur with these experimental studies. IFN-γ on the other hand is essential during L. monocytogenes infection, and provides early protection against the pathogen [23]. IL-18 a pro-inflammatory cytokine that stimulates IFN-γ production in T-helper type 1 cells and NK cells [25]. CX3CL1 and CCL20 are chemo-attractants that are produced following stimulation by IFN-γ and result in the recruitment of monocytes, NK cells and T-cells [26]. The higher levels of IL-18, CX3CL1 and CCL20 were not paralleled by significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ in patients with an unfavorable outcome.

CCL11 (Eotaxin) is an eosinophil specific chemokine assumed to be involved in eosinophilic inflammatory diseases. CCL11 production is not related to interferons and does not influence T-cell activation [27]. Its role in L. monocytogenes infection has not been studied, and it is unclear how the elevated levels of CCL11 in patients with an unfavorable outcome must be interpreted.

Our study has several limitations. First, only patients with a positive CSF culture for L. monocytogenes were included in this study. Negative CSF culture results occur in 11%–30% of patients with bacterial meningitis, and this percentage may be higher in patients with Listeria meningitis [1,6,28,29]. Therefore, these patients are underrepresented in our cohort. Second, as shown in Table 1, for the 26 patients we analyzed their cytokine levels had a higher Glasgow Coma Scale compared to 36 patients for whom no CSF was available. This implies a selection towards less severe diseases in the studied population compared to the general population of Listeria meningitis patients. Third, the number of patients is insufficient to correct for multiple testing in the analysis for outcome or perform multivariate analyses. Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution, as type 1 errors may occur due to the high number of variables tested, and validation of our results in other cohorts is warranted. Fourth, the number of patients is insufficient to analyze if the expression of biomarkers was influenced in subcategories such as the immune state of the patients, or patients with systemic of neurological complications. Finally, it remains unclear whether the identified proteins have a causative role in the development of unfavorable outcome or merely reflect increased disease severity. Despite these limitations, this study on CSF characteristics culture confirmed that Listeria meningitis is the largest series so far and gives insight in the pathophysiology of the disease.

5 Conclusions
Our data suggest that VEGF production (VEGF, CXCL7), complement activation (C3a), T-lymphocyte activation (sIL-2Rα, sCD40L, IL-12p40), and interferon production (IFN-α2, IL-18, CCL20, CX3CL1) are the most important elements of the immune response during Listeria meningitis, and may influence outcome. These data may give leads to further investigation in the pathophysiology of Listeria meningitis.
