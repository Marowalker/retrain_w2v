Multiple myeloma (MM) and its precursor, monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), have been linked with several
autoimmune conditions in the medical literature. Yet, significance of these
associations is not well understood.

Methods
Herein, we provide a comprehensive literature review on
autoimmune disorders identified in patients with MM and MGUS. Most relevant papers
were identified via searching the PubMed/Medline and EMBASE databases for articles
published from inception until May 1, 2016.

Findings
Scientific literature on autoimmune conditions in patients
with MM and MGUS consists of several case series and a multitude of case reports. Our
analysis suggests an increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions in patients with
MM and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), including various
autoimmune hematologic and rheumatologic conditions among other entities. Conversely,
persons with various autoimmune conditions tend to have a higher prevalence of MGUS
and MM than the general population.

Conclusions
Future research is required to explore further the link
between MGUS/MM and autoimmune disorders. Inflammation in the setting of autoimmunity
may serve as a trigger for MGUS and MM. In addition, a common genetic susceptibility
for developing both an autoimmune disease and MM/MGUS might also exist. Autoimmune
hematologic and rheumatologic diseases may pose important clinical problems for the
MM patients. Therefore, a catalogue of these problems is important so that physicians
are able to consider, identify and address them promptly.

Highlights
• A comprehensive review linking MM and MGUS with autoimmune
disorders

• There is increased prevalence of autoimmune conditions in
patients with MM and MGUS

• Most autoimmune disorders precede the development of plasma
cell dyscrasias
==== Body
1 Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal malignancy of plasma cells
characterized by an overproduction of monoclonal antibodies. Clinically, this entity
is characterized by skeletal lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia and renal failure.
According to the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER), the
incidence of MM is 6.1/100,000 people per year and increases to 30.4/100,000 people
per year in those older than 65 years. The median age of diagnosis
of MM is 71 years in whites, and 67 years in
blacks [1]. As a rule,
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) precedes MM and carries an
average 1% annual risk of progression to MM or other lymphoproliferative disorder
[2]. While the etiology of
both MGUS and MM remains unknown, risk factors such as advanced age, family history,
male gender and environmental factors have been present in both conditions
[3].

Several studies link MM with autoimmune disorders; however, the data
has not yet been fully analyzed or systematized. Herein, we review comprehensively
autoimmune conditions that have been associated with MM and MGUS in the medical
literature.

2 Materials and methods
We performed a systematic search on PUBMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE and
foreign articles published from inception to May 1, 2016. We searched for papers
using the following keywords: ‘multiple myeloma’ and ‘monoclonal gammopathy of
undetermined significance’ with each of the following keywords: ‘autoimmune’,
‘autoimmunity’, ‘autoimmune hemolytic anemia’, ‘immune thrombocytopenia’,
‘vasculitis’, ‘polyarthritis’, ‘rheumatoid arthritis’, ‘rheumatologic disease’,
‘nephrotic syndrome’, ‘autoimmune neutropenia’, ‘thrombocytopenia’, ‘pure red cell
aplasia’, ‘systemic lupus erythematosus’, ‘Sjogren's syndrome’, ‘myasthenia gravis’,
‘multiple sclerosis’ and ‘inflammatory bowel disease’. Several articles were also
obtained via cross-reference checking and “snowball” method, when databases different
from PUBMED and MEDLINE were accessed.

3 Overview and pathophysiology of autoimmunity and multiple
myeloma
Immune dysregulation plays a key role in lymphomagenesis. Of note,
chronic autoimmune inflammatory conditions have been associated with
lymphoproliferative disorders such as lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
[4], [5].

Indeed, chronic inflammation plays an important role in the
development of lymphoproliferative diseases and other cancers [6]. In fact, there is current interest
in development of targeted therapies that aim to control inflammation, such as with
the toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. For survival, B-cells in multiple myeloma
depend on inflammation pathways involving interleukin (IL)-6, IL-13, and Tumor
Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α. Furthermore, TLR and TLR-ligands expressed by B lymphocytes
promote their proliferation and survival [7]. Other important components that help maintaining a favorable
microenvironment for malignant B-cells in MM include the B-cell activating factor
(BAFF) which participates in the activation of the nuclear factor κ-B (NF-κB), an
important B-cell malignancy pathway [8].

In recent years, a number of reports and case studies have hinted at
the association between plasma cell dyscrasias and autoimmune disorders [9]. Osserman and Takatsuki were the
first ones to hypothesize that chronic antigen stimulation may trigger the
development of plasma cell dyscrasias [10]. As a result, chronic immune stimulation may lead to the
development of hematological malignancies by randomly introducing pro-oncogenic
mutations in rapidly dividing cells, including plasma cells [11].

4 Autoimmune hematologic conditions in multiple
myeloma
Anemia is almost invariably present patients with MM, either at
diagnosis or as the disease progresses. The pathogenesis of anemia in MM is usually
multifactorial, including a component anemia of inflammation due to myeloma itself,
bone marrow replacement with malignant plasma cells and anemia of renal failure due
to erythropoietin deficit. However, such entities as pernicious anemia, autoimmune
hemolytic anemia and pure red cell aplasia have also been described in these patients
(Table 1).

Thrombocytopenia occurs frequently in patients with plasma cell
dyscrasias. The pathogenesis usually involves marrow replacement by the myeloma cells
or treatment with anti-myeloma agents. Neutropenia in MM is often due to the use of
traditional chemotherapy agents, immunomodulating agents and, less frequently, other
agents. Notwithstanding, there are cases of immune thrombocytopenia and autoimmune
neutropenia in MM patients described in the literature (Table 1).

4.1 Pernicious anemia
Pernicious anemia is characterized by an autoimmune destruction
of gastric parietal cells and antibody-mediated inactivation of the intrinsic
factor resulting in malabsorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12), thus leading to
megaloblastic anemia. Some studies established that incidence of cobalamin
deficiency in patients with IgA multiple myeloma and MGUS is approximately 13.6%
(Table 1) [12]. Several publications, including
meta-analysis studies, suggest that pernicious anemia may represent a risk factor
for MM [9], [13], [14]. In addition, a recent case-control study found a
1.47 times increase in risk of developing MM in patients with pernicious anemia
[13]. While the exact
steps of pathogenesis of plasma cell dyscrasias in patients with pernicious anemia
is not well described, several hypotheses exist. One of them favors occurrence of
immune alterations and chromosome abnormalities in the bone marrow of patients
with pernicious anemia [15]. Another one postulates that cobalamin deficiency may
promote carcinogenesis and development of plasma cell dyscrasias by causing
abnormal DNA methylation [16]. Indeed, aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been
demonstrated in patients with MM [17].

4.2 Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is known to be associated with
B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms. Some studies claim that 4% of patients MM
also have AIHA [6], [18], while others suggest that AIHA is only rarely
associated with MM [19].
However, a more recent case series reported that 7 of the 66 (10.6%) MM cases were
complicated by AIHA and carried red cell autoantibodies in their serum
[20]. In addition,
another 10 cases of AIHA associated with MM have been recently reported in
literature [21]. Of those,
seven patients had IgG myeloma and four - IgA myeloma [20], [21]. Interestingly, one patient in
this series had a biclonal (IgG2 and IgA) MM. With the exception of two patients
with relapsed myeloma, all patients demonstrated remission of AIHA after therapy
for myeloma [20], [21]. While the pathogenesis of AIHA in MM is unclear, it
has been hypothesized that significant immune disturbances may allow the
development of clones that produce autoantibodies against erythrocyte surface
antigens [22].

4.3 Pure red cell aplasia
Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is an acquired autoimmune condition
[23]. PRCA in patients
with MM has traditionally been considered a rare occurrence. Recently, three case
reports have described a PRCA associated with MM [24], [25], [26]. In all cases, the
diagnosis of PRCA was made concurrently with the diagnosis of MM. Sarathy et al.
described a patient with PRCA refractory to immunosuppressive therapy that
improved only after the patient was treated with bortezomib [26]. This finding suggested that
PRCA was secondary to MM.

4.4 Immune thrombocytopenia
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) has been reported in patients with
lymphoproliferative disorders such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). While uncommon, ITP is also described in patients
with MM [27], [28].
In a series of six patients, thrombocytopenia was the initial presentation in two,
with myeloma being diagnosed at a later stage [27], [28]. Although the pathogenesis of ITP
in lymphoproliferative disorders is poorly understood, it has been proposed that
intrinsic immune alterations promote generation of specific autoreactive platelet
antibodies [27]. In
addition, ITP can be associated with AIHA as Evans' syndrome, with hemolysis
usually preceding thrombocytopenia [29]. Two cases of Evans' syndrome have been described in
patients with MM/MGUS [30], [31]. However, one of the cases occurred in a patient with
extramedullary plasmacytoma, a relatively rare plasma cell tumor not uncommonly
preceding MM. The patient had IgA monoclonal gammopathy in serum and urine which
was consistent with the diagnosis of MM [30]. The diagnosis of Evans' syndrome in this case preceded
the diagnosis of MM by four years. Interestingly, the second case of Evans'
syndrome was also described in a patient with IgA MGUS [31].

4.5 Autoimmune neutropenia
Therapy for MM can result in neutropenia. For instance,
lenalidomide-induced neutropenia occurs in up to 35% of patients [32]. Autoimmune neutropenia (AIN),
characterized by the presence of autoantibodies directed against neutrophils and
an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1500 cells/μL, rarely
occurs secondary to myeloma itself [33]. Aryal et al. [34] have recently reported a rare case of AIN associated with
MM [34]. The authors
hypothesized that the cross talk between T- and B-cells in MM can induce a clonal
T-cell expansion and T-cell receptor gene rearrangement leading to the development
of AIN. Shastri et al. [35] identified the presence of a clonal expansion of lymphoid
cells that led to light chain-restricted neutrophil-binding autoantibodies in
patients with antibody-induced neutropenia.

5 Rheumatologic disorders in multiple
myeloma
Increased prevalence of several rheumatologic conditions has been
linked with multiple myeloma and MGUS (Table
2).

5.1 Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic scleroderma, Sjogren's
syndrome (SS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have all been linked to MM
and plasma cell dyscrasias (Table
2) [6], [36], [37]. Nonetheless, the association between MM and RA is
rather weak according to several cohort studies and case reports [9], [36], [37]. Two recent
meta-analyses did not find a statistically significant increase in the risk for MM
in patients with RA [9], [13]. However, both studies showed a high level of
between-study heterogeneity (I2 > 50%) that could have affected their conclusions. A subgroup analysis
of the study by Shen et al. [13] revealed that patients with RA are more likely to be
diagnosed with subsequent MM (relative risk [RR] = 1.32). McShane et al. [9] found an increased risk of MM in
patients with RA (RR = 1.18) as well, although
they were not able to show statistical significance. In addition, several
case-control studies found that there was an increased risk of developing MM after
being diagnosed with RA [38], [39], [40]. The discrepancy between the studies could be due to
reverse causality bias. Indeed, RA preceded the development of MM in case studies
and most case reports in the literature [37], [38]. Consequently, it is conceivable
that prolonged antigenic stimulation present in RA could lead to the development
of MM.

5.2 Systemic lupus erythematosus
The association between SLE and lymphoproliferative disorders is
well known. In a cohort study, nearly 11% of patients with MM were reported to
have clinico-laboratory features of SLE [41]. In addition, increased prevalence of SLE in family
members of patients with MM has also been reported [42]. Review of literature revealed more than a
dozen cases of MM in patients with SLE [43]. In all of them, SLE either preceded or was diagnosed
concurrently with MM. The median age of diagnosis of MM in patients with SLE was
45 years, which is younger than the median age of 64 years seen in the general population [44]. The pathophysiology underlying the
association between SLE and MM is unclear. Similar to RA, it is plausible that
prolonged antigenic stimulation present in SLE leads to development of MM.
Conversely, defective immune surveillance in SLE may lead to selection of specific
B-cell clones, thus leading to the development of MM.

5.3 Dermatomyositis and polymyositis
Dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM) are associated with
hematologic malignancies [45]. A recent retrospective cohort study of 4641 patients with
MM/MGUS found that DM and PM are associated with an increased risk (relative
risk = 2.29) of developing plasma cell
dyscrasias [46]. Several
researchers even reported cases of DM-related MM [47], [48]. Similarly, a few case reports
described PM associated with MM [49], [50]. Unlike the situation in DM, the diagnosis of PM
occurred either simultaneously or after the diagnosis of MM. Chronic immune
stimulation that occurs in PM/DM is thought to cause T-cell and B-cell activation,
thus leading to the development of certain hematologic malignancies including MM
[51].

5.4 Sjogren's syndrome
There have been reports in literature linking Sjogren's syndrome
(SS) and MM [6], [13]. SS is a chronic autoimmune disease featuring a
progressive lymphocytic proliferation and destruction of the salivary and lacrimal
glands causing xerostomia and xeropthalmia. An increased risk of NHL and thyroid
cancer has been reported in patients with SS [52]. Several cohort studies found an increased
risk of MM and MGUS in patients with primary SS, while several reports described
SS preceding MM [53], [54], [55]. In addition, there has been an increased incidence of
free monoclonal light chains and proteins detected in serum and urine in patients
with SS, with monoclonal IgG as the most frequent immunoglobulin detected
[56], [57], [58]. Another study by Tomi et al. [59] found an increased risk of monoclonal
gammopathy in patients with SS, where a longer duration and higher severity of SS
correlated with the highest risk. Although exact mechanism remains unclear,
chronic inflammation as a potential trigger for the development of MM is
hypothesized [53].
Patients with concurrent SS and MM demonstrated clinical improvement of SS after
treatment with thalidomide and dexamethasone [60]. This suggests a possible causal
relationship between the two disorders.

5.5 Ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease
involving the axial skeleton. A retrospective cohort of over 4 million United
States (US) white and black male veterans followed for 27 years
found a significantly increased relative risk of 2.29 of developing MM and MGUS in
subjects with AS [46].
Several reports describe development of MM in patients with longstanding AS
[61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]. Among those cases, one patient had IgA lambda and
five patients had IgA kappa multiple myeloma. In all reported cases the diagnosis
of AS preceded the diagnosis of MM. While the exact mechanism for this association
is unclear, persistent plasma cell stimulation and activation in AS has been
proposed as a potential trigger for IgA MM [61].

5.6 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis
Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) represents a small vessel
vasculitis that may present as palpable purpura. Although data is limited on the
relationship between vaculitides and MM, several studies suggested an association
between the two. A case series by Bayer-Garner and Smoller [67] evaluated eight patients with
concomitant MM and LCV. This study found that all patients had IgG myeloma
associated with LCV. In contrast, several case-reports described IgA myeloma
associated with LCV [68], [69], [70], [71], [72]. Another
report describes a patient who developed MM, retinal vasculitis and temporal
arteritis [73]. While the
exact pathogenesis for the development of LCV in MM is unknown, some authors
postulated that overexpression of IL-6 genes in MM may contribute to the
development of LCV [67].

6 Autoimmune neurologic disorders in multiple
myeloma
Several retrospective cohort studies have reported the presence of
autoimmune neurologic disorders including myasthenia gravis (MG) and multiple
sclerosis (MS) in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, including MM (Table 3)
[9], [74], [75].
One report described MM that developed in a patient suffering from MS for 26 years [76].
Similarly, a case of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia was described in a patient
suffering from MS for 39 years [77]. Conversely, MS and peripheral demyelinating
neuropathies have been described in patients with monoclonal gammopathies
[78]. These findings
suggest a possible association between monoclonal gammopathies and demyelinating
neuropathies, which is thought to be due to shared genetic susceptibility. Indeed,
one study demonstrated increased frequency of MS in relatives of 1317 MM patients
[79].

Cases of coexistence of MG and MM in the literature are rare. In one
case report, MG preceded the development of MM by 20 years
[80]. In addition, MG was
described in a patient with extramedullary plasmacytoma and in another patient with
MM [81], [82].

7 Immunomodulatory drugs and multiple
myeloma
Published data have suggested that some agents used to treat
autoimmune disorders might confer an increased risk of myeloma. In particular, a
case-control study found a 5-, 3-, and 6-fold increased risk of developing multiple
myeloma in women taking prednisone, insulin, and gout medications (e.g.
sulphinpyrazone and colchicine), respectively [1], [9].

On the other hand, some multiple myeloma therapies can also lead to
the development of autoimmune conditions. In 2009, for the first time, Dasanu
and Alexandrescu reported a case of lenalidomide-induced
aplastic anemia that resolved spontaneously after the discontinuation of lenalidomide
[83]. In 2014, a
retrospective study by Montefusco et al. [84] found a 4.3% absolute risk of autoimmune disorders in MM
patients treated with lenalidomide. Most autoimmune conditions developed within six
months of starting therapy. These diseases included AIHA, ITP, Evans syndrome, optic
neuritis, autoimmune thyroiditis, polymyositis, and cutaneous vasculitis. In that
study, autologous stem cell transplantation for multiple myeloma was also associated
with a statistically significant increased risk of developing autoimmune
disorders.

8 Other autoimmune disorders in multiple
myeloma
Renal abnormalities such as tubular light-chain deposition disease,
interstitial nephritis, primary amyloidosis and monoclonal deposition disease are
well-recognized in patients with MM [85]. However, nephrotic syndrome is a rare presentation in MM. A
case-series by Thachil et al. [86] describes two MM patients who developed membranous
glomerulonephritis. Nephrotic syndrome resolved after the myeloma therapy, suggesting
an association between MM and membranous glomerulonephritis. Monoclonal
immunoglobulin deposition is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of nephrotic
syndrome in MM [86].

A large, retrospective cohort study of patients with multiple
myeloma suggested that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may be associated with the
development of MM [9]
(Table 3). Minami et al.
described instances of MM in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's
disease [87]. In both cases,
MM developed during a long-term observation of patients with IBD. There have been
nine additional reported cases of MM developing in the setting of IBD [88]. In these cases, the diagnosis of
MM was made between 6–30 years after the diagnosis of IBD. While
anti-TNF therapies (i.e. infliximab) could have played a role in the development of
MM, only 3 of 9 patients were treated with such agents. This suggests that mechanisms
involving increased B-cell activation might be responsible for the development of MM
in IBD [88].

9 MGUS and autoimmunity
MGUS is known to precede MM, and carries an average 1% annual risk
of progression to MM. Indeed, on a molecular level, MM is consistently preceded by
MGUS [89]. Nonetheless, most
cases of MGUS never progress to a full-blown MM. While the pathogenesis of MGUS and
MM is still not well-understood, there is evidence that immune dysregulation and/or
sustained immune stimulation may play a role in the development of these two
hematologic entities [90]. A
recent population-based study and a case-series showed clearly that several
immune-mediated conditions were associated with a significant risk of developing MGUS
[91], [92].

A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that autoimmune conditions were
associated with a nearly 42% increase in risk of MGUS [9]. Similar to the situation in MM, patients with
pernicious anemia display a significantly increased risk of developing MGUS
[9]. Furthermore, this
study found a non-significant association between ankylosing spondylitis and
polymyositis/dermatomyositis with MGUS [9].

A study of United States veterans suggested that subjects with
autoimmune conditions where autoantibodies are detectable are at increased risk of
developing MGUS [46].
Furthermore, a recent population-based study found that personal or family history of
autoimmune disease increases the risk of developing MGUS [91]. In that study, history of giant cell
arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and rheumatoid arthritis was associated with a
significantly increased risk of MGUS [91]. Two additional case-series demonstrated an increased
prevalence of autoimmune axonal or peripheral demyelinating neuropathy in patients
with MGUS [93], [94].

In a recent prospective study, 15% patients with MGUS were found to
have a preceding autoimmune disorder [95]. Sjogren's syndrome, polymyositis and vitiligo have been
reported to precede the development of MGUS in three patients from Senegal
[92]. Interestingly, their
monoclonal components stabilized after the treatment of their autoimmune conditions.
Another case series reported four patients with Sjogren's syndrome , Kikuchi disease,
neuromyelitis optica and ankylosing spondylitis, respectively, who developed MGUS
either coincidently or up to 10 years after the diagnosis of the
autoimmune condition [90].

Several studies have found that inflammatory/infectious conditions
such as pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis and osteoarthritis increase the risk of
developing MGUS and in some cases - of MM [46], [91]. This suggests that an overwhelming
inflammatory process can trigger the development of MGUS and myeloma. It had been
proposed that infections can lead to a clonal proliferation by serving as a trigger
for certain genetic translocations [96].

Taken together, these findings suggest that autoimmune diseases and
inflammatory conditions may increase the risk of developing MGUS. As a result,
chronic antigen stimulation may trigger the development of a plasma cell dyscrasia.
Alternatively, there might be a common genetic or environmental susceptibility for
developing both an autoimmune disease and a MGUS.

10 Discussion and conclusions
Patients with MM appear to be at increased risk for various
autoimmune conditions. Nonetheless, information available in the literature on
autoimmune conditions in patients with MM/MGUS consists largely of retrospective
analyses of case series or isolated reports. This might limit the accuracy of our
analysis. Some conclusions of our review might render an overestimation of the
association between autoimmune conditions and MM due to the retrospective nature of
most studies on this topic in the published literature. Presence of publication bias
is another concern, reflecting the fact that studies reporting positive associations
are more likely to be published than studies reporting negative associations.
Finally, some associations between instances of autoimmunity and MM/MGUS could
represent a mere coincidence.

Etiopathogenesis of autoimmune conditions and MM appears
multifactorial and complex. Furthermore, insights from pathophysiology could explain
the risk for both diseases. In most cases, development of an autoimmune condition
precedes the development of MM. This echoes the hypothesis made by Rudolf Virchow
who, in 1863, stated that the origin of cancer at different sites was due to chronic
inflammation. Consequently, MM/MGUS could develop due to chronic inflammation in the
setting of autoimmune disorders. Chronic antigenic stimulation of B-lymphocytes
present in autoimmune disorders might eventually lead to clonal proliferation, and
ultimately to MM. In addition, defective immune surveillance in autoimmunity may lead
to pre-selection of specific B-cell clones, thus triggering development of MM.
Moreover, some studies suggested shared genetic susceptibility for both
conditions.

Many autoimmune diseases could be primary, and may play a role in
the pathogenesis of MGUS/MM. Conversely, autoimmune conditions may develop after the
diagnosis of MGUS/MM has been made. Future studies are needed to better understand
the relationship between MM and autoimmune disorders. The autoimmune conditions can
pose significant clinical problems for the MM patients and health care providers;
therefore, a catalogue of this information is important to raise awareness and
improve timely diagnosis and management.
