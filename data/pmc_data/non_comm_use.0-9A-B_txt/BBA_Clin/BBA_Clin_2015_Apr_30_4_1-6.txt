Oxidative stress occurs in many neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and evidence suggests that specific
proteins are oxidised in individual diseases. Thus measures of oxidised proteins
such as in human biological samples could represent potential disease-specific
biomarkers. Protein carbonylation is considered to be an important marker of
oxidative stress. In AD in particular, the peptidyl prolyl isomerase, Pin1, has
been shown to be sensitive to metal-catalysed oxidation with the addition of
carbonyl side-chains.

Methods
Based on this protein modification we developed a novel,
enzyme-linked sandwich immunoassay for the quantification of oxidised Pin1
(oxPin1) in human brain tissue samples.

Results
We successfully developed an ELISA for the measurement
of oxidised Pin1 in biological samples and measured oxPin1 in hippocampal tissue
extracts from controls and AD, which showed an increased ratio of oxPin1 to
total Pin1 in patients with early AD pathology compared with
controls.

Conclusions
We show that oxidised proteins, in this case oxPin1, can
be measured using the developed ELISA. In addition, our results support the
presence of increased oxidative stress in the early stages of AD pathology and
show that the oxPin1/Pin1 ratio could indicate early stage pathology. This
warrants further investigation in other biological fluids.

General significance
Importantly, further development and adaption of the
assay design will enable multi-functional use for the quantification of oxidised
proteins in tissues and biological fluids that may be used in investigating the
role of oxidised proteins in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly
in which disease-specific protein oxidation has been
implicated.

Highlights
• A multifunctional ELISA for the measurement of
oxidised proteins was developed.

• Oxidised Pin1 was measured in hippocampal tissues
using the developed ELISA.

• The ratio of oxPin1:total Pin is increased in early
stages of Alzheimer's disease.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The brain uses more oxygen than any other organ of the body,
making it prone to damage by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by its
aerobic activity. ROS are produced continuously and play an important role in
biological processes such as signal transduction, immune responses and ageing
[1]. An imbalance
between endogenous pro-oxidants and antioxidant defences leads to unregulated
production of ROS and subsequent oxidative stress [2] and is implicated in the progression of
neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) [3].

One of the most important measures currently used to measure
oxidative stress is the quantification of the oxidative state of glutathione
(GSH), the most prevalent antioxidant in the brain. In particular, the ratio
between GSH and oxidised glutathione (GSH/GSSG) has been shown to be decreased
in affected regions of AD brain compared with controls [4]. However, the use of GSH as a measure of
oxidative stress has recently been questioned [5]. Furthermore, GSH/GSSG is a broad measure
of oxidative stress, which is a feature of a wide range of diseases, and is not
a marker for a specific disease.

Several alternative methods of measuring specific types of
oxidative stress such as metal-catalysed oxidation, nitration, and methionine
oxidation are also available but, again, these are generally not specific for an
individual disease [6].
Since there is now increasing evidence that specific proteins are oxidised in
specific neurodegenerative diseases [7], [8], [9], the measurement of
specifically oxidised proteins may represent an alternative with promise for the
development of disease-specific (oxidised protein) biomarkers. The role of
oxidative stress in AD has been rather extensively studied and several proteins
that appear to be specifically oxidised have been identified [7], [8]. However, the
measurements currently used, such as 2D gel analysis, chromatography and mass
spectrometry, are often specialised and time-consuming. Therefore, a simple
effective measure of individually oxidised proteins would be of significant
value. Therefore, we aimed to develop a simple effective method for measuring
oxidised proteins and investigated its use in the detection of specifically
oxidised proteins in AD as an example.

The oxidation of many proteins results in the addition of
carbonyl groups (aldehydes and ketones) to protein side chains (predominantly
Pro, Arg, Lys, and Thr) [10], [11]. In AD, the proteins that appear most vulnerable to
oxidative stress include the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, Pin1 and glutamine
synthetase (GS) which, when oxidised contain carbonyl side chains that can be
measured [11], [12]. Pin1 is of particular importance to AD, as it
binds to phosphorylated tau (p-tau), amyloid precursor protein (APP) and
glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β), all of which play a significant role in the
pathogenesis of AD. Pin1 binds specifically to proteins with phosphorylated
serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residues preceding a proline residue. Upon
binding, Pin1 catalyses the isomerisation of the protein at the proline residue,
twisting it from cis to trans
conformation [13]. Upon
Pin1 binding at Thr231, tau is isomerised to trans
conformation, facilitating its dephosphorylation by the
trans-specific protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
[14]. Similarly,
processing of APP via the non-amyloidogenic pathway is favoured when APP is in
trans-conformation and binding of Pin1 to APP at
Thr668 reduces production of Aβ42
[15]. Pin1 is also
responsible for inhibition of glycogen-synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), which is
involved in the phosphorylation of both APP and tau [16], [17]. By binding to GSK-3β, Pin1
reduces phosphorylation of both APP and tau thus further reducing amyloidogenic
processing of APP and hyperphosphorylation of tau. When Pin1 is oxidised, its
activity is restrained and can no longer bind to its substrates. The absence of
Pin1 may thus correlate with enhanced amyloidogenic APP processing and increased
Aβ42 production together with hyper-phosphorylation of tau
and subsequent formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) [7], [12].

In this study, we aimed to develop simple, effective means for
measuring levels of specifically oxidised proteins in human biological material.
As an example, we developed an ELISA for the measurement of oxidised Pin1
(oxPin1) and used it to measure levels of oxPin1 in brain tissue at different
stages of Alzheimer's disease pathology compared with cognitively normal
controls.

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Tissue samples
Frozen human hippocampal tissues from control and AD
patients were obtained from the Department of Pathology (Radboud UMC) and
were collected using standard protocols. Left over material from autopsies
was used according to institutional guidelines which were in line with the
Dutch national law. Additional hippocampal samples were obtained from The
Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB, Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience
Amsterdam), collected from donors for or from whom a written informed
consent for a brain autopsy and the use of the material and clinical
information for research purposes had been obtained by the NBB. Tissue
samples were taken as quickly as possible after autopsy and rapidly frozen
in liquid nitrogen. Post-mortem diagnosis and grading were performed and
judged by a neuropathologist, according to the criteria established by Braak
& Braak (all samples) and CERAD (for Radboud UMC patients only)
[18], [19], [20]. Clinical diagnosis of AD was based on the
clinical criteria of probable AD [21], [22]. Patient characteristics
for all patients are described in Table 1.

Protein extraction from brain tissue was performed by
suspending serial cryosections of hippocampus or cortex (10 μm thickness) in cold 5 M guanidine hydrochloride
(GuHCl)/50 mM Tris–HCL, pH 8.0
containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, EDTA free, Merck
Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and vortexing until the tissue was fully
lysed. Samples were centrifuged for 20 min (16,000 ×g at 4 °C) and the
supernatant was stored at − 80 °C in
clean polypropylene tubes. Total protein concentrations were determined
using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).

2.2 Production and purification of recombinant Pin1
protein
Recombinant Pin1 protein was produced using a construct of
Pin1 cDNA cloned in the pET-46 Ek expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI)
and OneShot® BL21 (DE3) Star™ cells (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
by isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (ITPG) induction. His-tagged recombinant
protein was purified under native conditions using a Nickel Nitrilotriacetic
acid (Ni-NTA) chromatography column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and elution
with imidazole. The protein was cleared of imidazole using dialysis with
phosphate buffered saline and subsequently concentrated using a 9 kDa cut-off protein concentrator according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
The final protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay
kit.

2.3 Oxidation of recombinant Pin1
protein
Purified Pin1 protein (80.8 μL; 0.5 μg/mL; estimated purity ~ 95% based on
SDS-PAGE gel analysis) was incubated with an oxidation solution containing
0.2 mM Fe(II)SO4, 10 mM H2O2 and 0.3 mM
EDTA in PBS (pH 7.4) in a final volume of 100 μL for 3 h [12]. One microliter of 40 μM butylated hydroxytoluene in methanol was added to stop the
reaction giving a final (theoretical) protein concentration of 0.4 μg/mL. The mixture was dialysed against PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C using a mini slide-a-lyser
cassette (2 kDa cut-off; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL,
USA) for 2 h and then overnight in fresh, cold PBS.
Following dialysis, the sample was divided into aliquots and stored at
− 80 °C.

2.4 SDS-PAGE analysis of Pin1
Recombinant Pin1 protein (1 μg) and an
equal volume of oxidised recombinant Pin1 protein were mixed with 4 × reducing sample buffer (25% (w/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS,
62.5 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 32 mM DTT and 0.005% (w/v) bromophenol blue) and PBS to a final
volume of 16 μL. Samples were then heated to 95 °C for 5 min, loaded on to SDS-PAGE gels
with 4% acrylamide stacking gel and 12% acrylamide running gel, and
electrophoresed at 200 V. Gels were stained with Coomassie
Brilliant Blue (R250, Serva) stain for 45 min. The
Precision Plus Protein™ Standard (All Blue) molecular weight marker
(10–250 kDa; Biorad Laboratories, Inc., California,
USA) was used to approximate protein size. Protein bands were scanned using
a BioRad Gel Doc 2000 apparatus and density measurements were used to
calculate oxPin1 concentration in comparison to non-oxidised protein
(Quantity One programme — BioRad v.4.2.1).

2.5 Direct ELISA for carbonylated
proteins
A direct ELISA for the measurement of carbonyl content in
the protein samples with minor modifications from the original protocol
[23] was used to
confirm protein carbonylation as a measure of protein oxidation. Protein
samples derivatised with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (5 μM
DNPH; 45 min) in 6 M GuHCl, pH 2.4 (1:3 ratio) were absorbed onto an ELISA plate. The
hydrazone adducts, 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP), were detected using a
biotinylated antibody directed against DNP (Anti-Dinitrophenyl-KLH, Rabbit
IgG Fraction, Biotin-XX Conjugate; Molecular Probes®, Oregon, USA), followed
by 20 min incubation with 100 μL of
streptavidin-HRP complex (1:200 R&D DuoSet kit). The colour reaction was
developed using TMB substrate (30 min at RT), stopped with
0.5 M H2SO4
(50 μL) and read at 450 nm (Tecan
Sunrise ELISA plate reader and Magellan data analysis software). The extent
of protein oxidation was assessed by comparison with an oxidised BSA
standard. Oxidised BSA and reduced BSA were prepared as previously described
[15].

2.6 OxPin1 sandwich ELISA
OxPin1 levels in brain tissue were quantified using a novel
homemade sandwich ELISA with oxidised recombinant Pin1 as standard. ELISA
plates (F96 cert. MaxiSorp™ Immuno-plate: Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were
incubated overnight at 4 °C with polyclonal rabbit
anti-DNP (2 μg/mL in 1 M
NaHCO3, pH 9.6; Life Technologies)
and washed (5 × 300 μL, 0.05%
Tween-20/phosphate buffered saline (PBST)) between all incubation steps.
Plates were blocked with 0.1% BSA/PBS, pH 7.4 (250 μL). Samples, standards (oxPin1, stock = 0.2 μg/μL) and blank (PBS) were
derivatised with 5 μM DNPH in 6 M GuHCl,
pH 2.4 (1:3 ratio), vortexed, incubated for 45 min in the dark, and subsequently diluted in sample diluent
(1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS). The highest
standard (50 ng/mL) was serially diluted in sample diluent
to obtain a 6-point standard curve. Standards, blank (PBS) and tissue
samples (100 μL/well) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT) with agitation (650 rpm). An additional wash step (1:1 ethanol:PBS) was used to
ensure the removal of unbound DNPH that could react with the detection
antibody. Detection antibody (250 ng/mL biotinylated
polyclonal goat anti-Pin1; R&D Pin1 DuoSet, #DYC2294) was applied for
1 h followed by 20 min incubation
with 100 μL of streptavidin-HRP complex (1:200 R&D
DuoSet kit). The colour reaction was developed using TMB substrate
(30 min at RT), stopped with 0.5 M
H2SO4 (50 μL) and
read at 450 nm (Tecan Sunrise ELISA plate reader and
Magellan data analysis software).

2.7 Total Pin1 sandwich ELISA
Pin1 levels in brain tissue (diluted 1:25) were measured
using a commercially available ELISA kit (R&D DuoSet® IC for total Pin1;
Abingdon, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

2.8 Statistical analysis
Between groups comparison was performed using Kruskal–Wallis
tests for non-Gaussian distributed data (oxPin1) and one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) or Student's t-test for Gaussian-distributed data. Analysis
of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to control for covariant influences
such as age, gender and post-mortem delay.

3 Results
3.1 Confirmation of Pin1 oxidation
Several oxidation conditions were tested and we found that
oxidation using 0.2 mM Fe(II)SO4,
10 mM H2O2 and
0.3 mM EDTA gave the optimal results with respect to
oxidation level versus protein degradation. Still, SDS-PAGE gel analysis
(Fig.
1A) suggested that Pin1
was partially degraded after oxidation. We noted a more slowly migrating
band for oxidised Pin1 than non-oxidised Pin1 (Fig. 1A) as has been observed previously
for other oxidised proteins [24], [25], [26] and we were able to
confirm the band as Pin1 in western blot analyses using both polyclonal and
monoclonal anti-Pin1 antibodies (Fig. 1B). Using band density measurements we calculated
the concentration of full-length oxidised Pin1 to be 0.2 μg/μL. We derivatised proteins (either from recombinant source or from
brain extracts) with DNPH and immunoprecipitated these using
anti-Pin1-coated protease G beads. The derivatised proteins were detected
with the anti-DNP antibody and in this way we observed oxPin1 in the form of
a detectable band at the correct molecular weight expected for Pin1.
However, the results for the brain extract proteins gave inconsistent
results when repeated (data not shown). Oxidation of Pin1 was confirmed
using a direct ELISA for detection of carbonyl side chains. Compared with
untreated Pin1, reduced BSA, and PBS treated with DNPH, high OD450 values in
the direct ELISA obtained for oxPin1 and oxidised BSA confirmed their
oxidation status (Fig.
1C). Furthermore, the OD450 value for reduced Pin1 did
not differ significantly from untreated Pin1 suggesting that untreated Pin1
was not oxidised.

3.2 Validation of the sandwich ELISA for
oxPin1
A typical standard curve for oxPin1 is shown in
Fig.
2. Linearity was observed
up to 50 ng/mL. The lower limit of detection was
2.7 ng/mL. Consistent with the results of direct
ELISAs, PBS and non-oxidised recombinant Pin1 (up to 50 ng/mL) treated in the derivatisation reaction were detected at only very
low levels (OD450 value consistently less than 0.2; data not shown).
Omission of capture antibody, detection antibody or antigen gave absorbance
values resembling the blank confirming the absence of cross-reaction of
either capture or detection antibodies with other proteins or each other. It
also indicated that neither the biotinylated Pin1 antibody nor brain tissue
samples bind non-specifically to the plate.

3.3 Levels of total protein, Pin1 and oxPin1 in brain
extracts
Grouped patient demographics and protein
levels are reported in Table
1. Patients were divided into groups and analysed
according to Braak stage pathology as follows: Controls (Braak 0–2), early
AD pathology (Braak 3–4) and advanced AD pathology (Braak 5–6) [27]. Levels of Pin1 and
oxPin1 reported in the main text are reported per μg of total protein. The
clinical characteristics of individual patients are provided in
Supplementary Table
S1.

Analysis of hippocampal tissue according to the degree of
pathology showed that Pin1 tended to be correlated with post-mortem delay in
controls (r = 0.872, p = 0.054) and was correlated with age in advanced AD
(r = 0.789, p = 0.012). No other correlations between protein
measurement and age, gender or post-mortem delay were observed. When using
ANCOVA to control for both age and post-mortem delay, Pin1 levels, but not
oxPin1 levels, were significantly higher in advanced AD pathology compared
with both early pathology (p < 0.01)
and controls (p < 0.05; Fig. 3A and B). The oxPin1:Pin1 ratio was significantly higher in
early pathology than controls (p < 0.05) and advanced AD pathology (p = 0.01; Fig.
3C).

4 Discussion
We designed a novel sandwich ELISA for the purpose of measuring
specifically oxidised proteins using measures of oxPin1 in biological samples as
an example. We demonstrate the successful application of this novel sandwich
ELISA to assess the levels of oxPin1 in human hippocampal samples from AD
patients and healthy controls. In addition, we show evidence of an increased
ratio of oxPin1 to Pin1 in early AD pathology which substantiates the need for
further investigation of the role of Pin1 and oxPin1 in the pathophysiology of
AD. The design of this ELISA has potential applications for the measurement of
other proteins that are specifically oxidised to produce carbonyl side chains in
AD and a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases that represent potential
biomarkers of disease.

In the current study, the ratio of oxPin1:Pin1 seemed more
informative than individual measurement of Pin1 or oxPin1 alone. When we
analysed the ratio of oxPin1:Pin1 in human hippocampal samples we observed an
increased ratio in the hippocampi of patients with early AD pathology (Braak
stage 3–4) compared with controls (Braak stage 0–2; p = 0.032). This is consistent with the notion that Pin1 is oxidised
in AD and that this occurs early in the disease process particularly since we
did not observe an increase in the ratio of oxPin1:Pin1 in the patients with
advanced AD pathology. This contradicts previous reports [7], [12], but we classified
our samples according to Braak pathology to investigate the relationship between
levels of oxPin1 and the pathological features of AD whereas the earlier studies
used clinical diagnosis of MCI and AD established by neurological and
psychological assessment. This may provide some explanation for differences
between the studies. We also noted that post-mortem delay tended to be
correlated with levels of Pin1 in the control samples. This could also
potentially explain differences between studies and should be further explored
in future studies.

The finding of increased oxPin1:Pin1 in the hippocampus of early
AD pathology is relevant in consideration of other research showing the
involvement of Pin1 in both the direct regulation of tau phosphorylation and the
indirect regulation via GSK3β and PP2A. Together, the observation that Pin1 is
oxidised early in AD, and likely leads to its dysfunction, helps to confirm that
oxidation of Pin1 may lead to enhanced formation of NFTs as it can no longer
bind to and dephosphorylate the tau protein.

Interestingly, we observed an ~ 40% increase
in Pin1 levels in the hippocampus of patients with advanced AD pathology
compared with controls and an ~ 19% decrease in early stage AD
pathology compared with controls. The increase in Pin1 levels in the advanced
pathology samples was surprising as we expected from previous research that Pin1
levels would be generally decreased in AD [12], [28]. However, a more recent report
using immunohistochemical methods showed redistribution and deposition of Pin1
into neuronal granules in the brains of patients with advanced AD pathology
compared with controls [29]. Rather than a reduction of Pin1, per se, in these
tissues the immunohistochemical investigations tended to suggest an abnormal
accumulation of Pin1 that might support our finding of increased Pin1 in
advanced AD pathology [29]. The correlation observed between severity of Pin1
granules and NFTs in patients with Braak stages 5–6 [29], although weak, hints that levels of Pin1
may be associated with pathological changes. Therefore, future studies could use
a combination of ELISA and immunohistochemical techniques to firmly establish
associations between oxPin1and Pin1 granules or NFTs.

In the current study, the use of a GuHCl protocol to extract
proteins from the brain tissue should have ensured the total extraction of Pin1
from all cell fractions including any that may have been accumulated abnormally
in granules but potentially could have affected Pin1 stability. We do not
believe that the latter was the case as repeated measures of oxPin1 following
freeze-thawing were consistent. In earlier experiments, we also measured levels
of oxPin1 in brain tissue extracted using other extraction buffers, including
RIPA carbonate, and AC/BT (1.5 M aminocaproic acid, 75 mM Bis-Tris) buffers. However, levels of oxPin1 in these samples
were much lower than those measured in the GuHCl extract and were often at, or
below, the limit of detection.

We acknowledge that relatively small numbers of hippocampal
tissues limit our ability to generalise the findings to other AD patients. In
this study oxPin1 was only measured in brain tissue and showed only moderate
differences between the groups thus limiting its current potential for use as a
clinical biomarker. The main purpose of demonstrating the use of our developed
ELISA for the measurement of oxPin1 in human hippocampal samples has been,
however, adequately achieved. The utility of the ELISA will need to be further
examined in studies including measures of Pin1 and oxPin1 not only in larger
numbers of patients but should also compare hippocampal levels with levels in
another brain area in which no, or only minimal, changes might be expected (e.g.
cerebellum). We were able to show that specifically oxidised proteins can be
measured in biological material. The design of our ELISA using an anti-DNP
antibody to capture all carbonylated proteins and specifically detect a target
protein using a protein-specific detection antibody enables its adaptation for
measurement of other potential disease-specific oxidised proteins such as
alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease [30], [31], [32], and glutamine
synthetase in AD [7]. In
addition, the use of antibodies to specific proteins reduces the likelihood of
measuring background interference from other carbonylated molecules (e.g.
nucleic acids and lipids), which can otherwise give interference [6].

Other adaptations using antibodies to measure alternative forms
of oxidative modification (e.g. cysteine or methionine oxidation) might be of
high relevance for the measurement of some proteins. For example, the oxidation
of DJ-1 at its cysteine (Cys) residues has been implicated in the pathogenesis
of Parkinson's disease and might be of interest for future studies. We have
preliminary evidence that assays adapted for the measurement of Cys-oxidised
DJ-1 shows promise. For this assay we used purified recombinant Fab antibody
fragments specifically directed against Cys-oxidised DJ-1 as the capture
antibody and a biotinylated goat anti-human DJ-1 antibody for detection and
could use this assay to measure Cys-oxidised DJ-1 in brain tissue extracts and
some CSF samples but not in serum. However, these ELISAs will require further
optimisation to improve inter-assay reproducibility and consistency in the
background signal. The development of purified antibodies directed against a
specific form of oxidised protein would be of benefit in developing optimal
ELISAs in future studies. Such studies may reveal if protein oxidation is a
global process in early stages of neurodegenerative pathology.

5 Conclusions
We have developed a novel sandwich ELISA for the measurement of
oxPin1 in human brain tissue and shown that the ratio of oxPin1:Pin1 is
increased in the hippocampus of early stage AD pathology compared with both
controls and advanced AD pathology. Further development and modification of the
assay design will enable multi-functional use for the quantification of oxidised
proteins in tissues and biological fluids that may be used in investigating the
role of oxidised proteins in a range of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly
in which disease-specific protein oxidation has been implicated.
