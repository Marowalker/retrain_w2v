in the developing world. Because of the perishable nature of milk, marketing arrangements for
collection, distribution and sale are important for enhanced livelihoods in the smallholder dairy
sector. In this study we examined the relationship between market quality and basic feeding and
breeding practices at farm level. We define market quality as the attractiveness and reliability of
procurement channels and associated input supply arrangements. We took as our study countries, India
with its well-developed smallholder dairy sector, and Ethiopia where the smallholder dairy industry
has remained relatively undeveloped despite decades of development effort. We conducted village
surveys among producer groups in 90 villages across three States in India and two Regions in
Ethiopia. Producer groups were stratified according to three levels of market quality – high, medium
and low. Data showed that diet composition was relatively similar in India and Ethiopia with crop
residues forming the major share of the diet. Concentrate feeding tended to be more prominent in
high market quality sites. Herd composition changed with market quality with more dairy (exotic)
cross-bred animals in high market quality sites in both India and Ethiopia. Cross-bred animals were
generally more prominent in India than Ethiopia. Herd performance within breed did not change a
great deal along the market quality gradient. Parameters such as calving interval and milk yield
were relatively insensitive to market quality. Insemination of cross-bred cows was predominantly by
artificial insemination (AI) in India and accounted for around half of cross-bred cow inseminations
in Ethiopia. Data on perceptions of change over the last decade indicated that per herd and per cow
productivity are both increasing in high market quality sites with a more mixed picture in medium
and low-quality sites. Similarly dairy-derived income is on the increase in high market quality
sites. This is accompanied by a strong increase in stall feeding at the expense of grazing. The
study indicates that the first constraint to intensification of dairy production in Ethiopia is the
genetic quality of the herd. There is less scope for improved AI provision in India since the
cross-bred herd is mainly serviced by AI already. However, as for Ethiopia, there is considerable
scope for closing yield gaps in India through improved feed use and supply. Results strongly show
that well-developed markets with good procurement arrangements are key for sustainable dairy
intensification.

Implications
Dairy systems in developing countries continue to intensify in response to increasing human
populations, declining land per head of population and increasing demands for animal source foods.
Dairy production is a promising livelihood option for poor households. This study shows that dairy
productivity per animal within breed is relatively stable across a gradient of market quality and
that productivity improvements as market quality improves are mainly associated with greater
proportions of genetically improved animals that are better fed. The quickest gains to dairy
production, especially in Ethiopia, would be through greater focus on improving the genetic merit of
the dairy herd.

Introduction
Livestock systems in general are going through a period of unprecedented change (Seré et
al., 2008) and dairy systems are no exception. The
rapidly evolving scene is a response to a series of drivers including population growth and
urbanisation, both of which contribute to increased demand for livestock products. We are now
half-way through the so-called Livestock Revolution (Delgado et al., 1999) projected at the end of the 1990s and the predictions for
increased demand for livestock products are being borne out in many parts of the world. Indeed, the
demand for dairy products in some parts of the world has increased at a much faster rate than was
predicted in the late 1990s (APHCAP et al., 2008); however, note work of Pica-Ciamarra and Otte (2011) for some caution on interpretation of evidence on increased demand for livestock
products.

At the same time, poverty rates in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia remain
stubbornly high. Dairy development has often been identified as having an especially large potential
for providing pathways out of poverty for poor rural livestock keepers, as livestock already form a
considerable share of their assets and family labour is often not their greatest constraint (Staal,
2001). Increasing the productivity of the existing assets
has often been regarded as the most sustainable approach to alleviating poverty (Bachmann, 2004). However, the noticeable increase in productivity of dairy
production systems is not widespread. Significant efforts to enhance livestock (including dairy)
production through productivity improving technologies across South Asia and especially in
Sub-Saharan Africa have met with very limited success (Hall et al., 2007). Based on limited observations, our hypothesis is that at
the household level, the main driver of intensification in dairy production appears to be the
quality of available value chains. Quality
1
 in this context means the reliability and attractiveness of dairy procurement systems, which
often includes the delivery of livestock-related services. In such instances, anecdotal evidence
suggests that households seem to think it worthwhile to intensify dairy production by investing in
better feeds and higher-yielding animals. We assume that market quality is generally exogenous to
individual households and so can be taken as a given in household decision making.

Very little systematic research has been conducted on the comparative analysis of dairy systems
based on market quality. The research reported here is, therefore, aimed to contribute to filling
this gap. India and Ethiopia were selected as our study countries, since many poor livestock keepers
are engaged in dairy production and a range of dairy system types exist in each country. The range
of dairy system types encompasses at one extreme, zero grazed animals producing around 15 l of milk
per cow per day and being kept purely for milk production through to, at the other extreme,
extensively grazed animals offered no supplementary feeding and producing <1 l per cow per day.
The extent of dairy development varies considerably between these two countries, with India having a
long history of developing various value chain components, most notably through the co-operative
movement (Gautam et al., 2010), while in
Ethiopia the development of market chains for fluid milk that extend beyond the very local, is
relatively nascent (Ahmed et al., 2004).
There are thus interesting comparisons to be made with a view to providing insights into where and
how to target interventions aimed at enhancing dairy-derived incomes.

The research reported here involves a comparison of dairy systems in Ethiopia and India and
specifically the effect of market quality on feeding and breeding practices. The study has a limited
geographic scope and while the data provide a good overview, the absolute numbers should be
interpreted with caution based on the relatively small geographic coverage of the study and the
limited number of villages visited. However, the overall trends and the marked differences in
feeding and breeding aspects of the dairy system in the two countries provide useful data that
suggest possible intervention areas to improve dairy production by poor dairy farmers for enhanced
income.

Methods
Development of dairy system typology
A typology of district/Woreda
2
-level dairy systems based on ‘market quality’ was developed early in the study. Three strata
of market quality were defined as ‘high’, ‘medium’ and ‘low’ market quality. The specifics of these
three categories differ by country but in general relate to the quality of procurement arrangements.
In India, high market quality implies the presence of efficient dairy co-operatives, the activity of
private sector dairy companies and perhaps evidence of interest in milk procurement from the
supermarket sector. Medium market quality is characterised by conventional milk co-operatives whose
functioning leaves room for improved efficiency and a large share of informal milk marketing. Low
market quality districts are dominated by informal milk value chains with only minor contributions
from dairy co-operatives and no activity by formal private sector dairy companies. In Ethiopia, high
market quality implies the presence of dairy co-operatives with associated processing infrastructure
and perhaps private processors who engage in milk procurement. Medium market quality denotes the
presence of some organised milk procurement, usually through milk co-operatives but without milk
processing facilities. Low market quality is characterised by the absence of milk marketing other
than through informal exchange between households.

Selection of case study sites
Based on the above typology a series of case study sites was selected in India and Ethiopia
(Supplementary Figure). Because of the markedly different geographical scale of India and Ethiopia
attention was given to the equivalence of administrative units in the two countries. For the
purposes of site selection, State (India) and Region (Ethiopia) were considered as equivalent;
furthermore District (India) and Woreda (Ethiopia) were considered as equivalent. An expert
consultation approach was adopted in India whereby acknowledged national experts were asked to score
States based on variation in marketing quality, variation in production intensity, importance of
dairy production and common production systems (e.g. irrigated rice-wheat; rain-fed cereal-cotton).
In Ethiopia selection of Regions was more qualitative and based on conversations with national
experts; because of the scarcity of areas in which high market quality conditions exist, only two
Regions were deemed to have sufficiently developed market quality conditions to be included in the
study. In India, it was decided to focus on three States, namely Bihar, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh
where dairy production is important and a variety of dairy marketing systems exist. The selected
States represent the intensive, irrigated, semi-arid Northwest; the extensive, irrigated, sub-humid
East; and the rain-fed South. In Ethiopia, Amhara Region and Oromiya Region were selected as the
case study regions. Within each State/Region, six Districts/Woredas were selected for the survey
with two representing high market quality, two medium market quality and two low market quality. In
India, local experts classified all Districts in the selected States by market quality (as defined
above). Subsequently, two districts were randomly selected from each milk marketing quality class by
drawing lots. However, in one Indian State, Andhra Pradesh, the collected data contradicted the
expert classification resulting in a reclassification of the six selected Districts. In Ethiopia,
because of the paucity of secondary data on market quality, selection of Woredas according to market
quality was left to collaborating scientists from the national research system who purposively
selected Woredas based on their expert knowledge of market quality.

Data collection
A survey tool was devised to capture simple aggregate data on dairy feeding and breeding
practices, dairy productivity and dairy-derived household impacts as well as on characteristics
regarding milk marketing, service delivery and the institutional environment. Data were composed of
farmer group recall data. Data were collected from six milk producer respondent groups per
District/Woreda (two groups from three villages) yielding a data set including data from 180
respondent groups from 90 villages across India and Ethiopia (five States/Regions×six
Districts/Woredas×three villages×two respondent groups). Respondents were groups of dairy producers
and the subsequent unit of analysis was at the level of respondent group. Respondent groups were
asked to give responses at village level, not just for the group. The average number of respondents
per group in India was 9.0 (s.d.=7.24; females : total=0.10) while in Ethiopia it was 5.2
(s.d.=1.47; females : total=0.21). Selection of respondents was ad hoc but care was
taken to include farmers from different wealth categories; this was achieved by estimating the
average herd size in each village through enquiry among villagers and then selecting roughly equal
numbers of respondents below and above the average threshold. Feeding data were disaggregated by
season based on farmer recall. The seasons were named as ‘dry’, ‘rainy’ and ‘winter’ in both
countries although because of varying agro-ecology, season definition differed by country and even
within country. In Ethiopia the dry season was defined as occurring between February and June, the
rainy season between July and September and the winter season between October and January. In India
the definitions were broadly similar to Ethiopia but with some temporal variation due to the
geographical dispersion of study States; the rainy season corresponds to the Kharif season, the
winter season to the Rabi season and the dry season to the months following the Rabi season but
before the Kharif season. Because of the markedly different stage of intensification in India and
Ethiopia minor differences in survey questions were accommodated while ensuring that the collected
data remained suitable for combined analysis and meaningful comparisons. The survey was implemented
simultaneously in India and Ethiopia during March to May 2010.

Data analysis
Data were analysed using analysis of variance to test for the main effects of market quality,
season and country and their respective interactions. When analysing the composition of stall-fed
feeds, each of the three major feed components (dry fodder, green fodder, concentrate) was analysed
separately since the proportions added to one meaning that the three ration composition variables
were not independent. Herd composition data were analysed separately for each country since the
presence of buffaloes in India but not in Ethiopia made direct comparison problematic. An additional
analysis was therefore conducted considering the composition of the cattle herd only, characterised
by the share of cross-bred cows. Data on calving interval, age at first calving, average daily milk
yield and average annual milk yield were analysed separately for each country since the presence of
buffaloes in India but not in Ethiopia again made direct comparisons problematic. Daily milk yield
was based on farmer recall of average values while cows were lactating. Average annual milk yield
was calculated according to the following formula: Average daily milk yield (l/day)×30
(day/month)×lactation length (months)×12/intercalving period (months). Data on method of
insemination were again proportional, adding to one, so analysis was conducted only on the reported
percentage of animals per village inseminated by artificial insemination (AI), which is also the
most important variable for characterising the technological development of breeding systems. Data
on source and price of insemination services were highly variable and not amenable to analysis. The
data are therefore presented as simple descriptive statistics.

Results
Feeding strategies
Feeding strategies are an important indicator of the intensity of production. According to
respondents grazing was still an important source of nutrition for dairy animals comprising around
half of the overall diet in Ethiopia and 20% to 40% of the diet in India. There was some evidence
for grazing accounting for a higher proportion of the diet in areas of low market quality,
especially in India. Conversely, stall feeding tended to account for more of the overall diet as
market quality increased. There was seasonal variation in the share of grazing especially in
Ethiopia where grazing formed an important component of the diet during the ‘winter’ season when
animals are allowed to graze. In general seasonal variation in diet composition was more pronounced
in Ethiopia than in India. Stall feeding accounted for a higher proportion of the diet in India than
in Ethiopia (Table 1).Table 1 Share of grazing by season and market quality

The composition of the stall-fed diet was relatively similar in India and Ethiopia comprising dry
fodder consisting mostly of crop residues (around 60%), green fodder (around 25%) and concentrate
(around 15%). The proportion of concentrate fed decreased with declining market quality in both
countries as might be expected (Table 2). However, it
should be kept in mind that the absolute amounts of stall-fed feeds, especially important with
regard to concentrates, was lower in Ethiopia than in India, because of the greater contribution of
grazing. As share of total feed, concentrates contributed 8% and 18% in Indian low and high market
quality sites, respectively, while in Ethiopia the corresponding values are 7% and 14%.Table 2 Feed composition of stall fed feed

Breed composition
Breed composition also differed by market quality. The proportion of cross-bred animals declined
with declining market quality in both countries, while the share of indigenous cows decreased.
However, a trend for the share of buffaloes over the three market quality categories could not be
established (Table 3). The proportion of indigenous animals
was generally higher in Ethiopia than in India comprising nearly 90% of the cows in areas of low
market quality (Supplementary Table 1).Table 3 Share of animal type within herd by market quality

Performance
Herd performance data showed that, as expected, cross-bred cows performed better than indigenous
cows. In addition, in general, Indian herds showed higher performance than Ethiopian herds. The
effects of market quality within breed were relatively minor in magnitude.

For example, overall average calving intervals for indigenous and cross-bred cows in Ethiopia
were 22.5 and 15.6 months, respectively. The corresponding figures for India were 17.1 and 13.8
months with 17.9 months being recorded for buffaloes. Market quality appeared to have no systematic
effect on calving interval despite some significant differences (Table 4).Table 4 Effect of market quality on calving interval and average annual milk yield

For age at first calving a similar pattern was observed. Mean values for age at first calving in
Ethiopia were 49.8 and 33.4 months for indigenous and cross-bred cows, respectively. The
corresponding figures for India were 41.4 and 30.2 months; the value for buffaloes was 44.0 months
(Supplementary Table 2). While market quality had no influence on age at first calving in Ethiopia,
heifer fertility increased significantly with market quality in India with all three animal types
showing decreased age at first calving with improved marketing. The difference was greatest between
medium and high marketing quality sites.

For average daily milk yields, collected as recall data from respondents, there were the expected
large differences between indigenous and cross-bred cows but the proportional differences were more
pronounced in Ethiopia than in India. Average values in Ethiopia were 1.7 and 6.6 l per cow per day
for indigenous and cross-bred cows, respectively. In India the corresponding yields were 4.2 and 9.6
l per cow per day. Buffaloes were reported to be yielding 5.5 l of milk per cow per day, however
with double the fat content of cows’ milk. There was no effect of market quality on daily milk yield
in India within breed, while there was a minor effect in Ethiopia with cows in high market quality
sites yielding more than in medium and low-quality sites (Supplementary Table 2).

Average annual milk yield (calculated from average daily milk yield, calving interval and
lactation length) showed a similar pattern to that of daily milk yield. However, both animal type
and market effects were detected for both countries for this variable. Cross-bred cows in Ethiopia
yield more than five times as much milk as indigenous cows (1556 v. 276 l/year). In
India cross-bred cows yielded a little over three times as much milk as indigenous cows (2384
v. 708 l/year) with buffaloes showing an average annual milk yield of 1078 l/year.
Comparing market quality classes, average annual milk yield also increased moving from medium to
high-quality sites (Table 4).

Breeding practices
The survey data indicated that artificial insemination was the dominant means of inseminating
cross-bred cows in India regardless of market quality (over 90% for all market quality classes).
Even among indigenous cows a reasonable proportion was inseminated artificially (overall average
43%). In Ethiopia, a similar pattern was observed except at a lower level; the corresponding
percentages for AI among cross-bred and indigenous cows were 59% and 12% respectively. In general,
the use of AI among indigenous cows (and buffaloes in India) decreased with declining market quality
in both Ethiopia and India. Among cross-bred cows, the extent of AI use was insensitive to market
quality. In India this was probably due to saturation effects while in Ethiopia, the presence of
development projects in low market quality sites may have created some anomalies in AI use (Table 5).Table 5 Types of insemination service by market quality (percentage of animals inseminated by different
methods)

Improved bulls hardly featured in the Indian sites but were a prominent means of insemination in
Ethiopia, particularly in high market quality sites, where they provided nearly half of all
inseminations. On the other hand, service by indigenous bulls was dominant among indigenous cows in
Ethiopia low market quality sites. In India cross-bred cows were predominantly inseminated by AI.
Roughly one-third to two-thirds of indigenous cows were also inseminated by AI especially in high
market quality sites (Supplementary Table 3).

In Ethiopia, results indicate that AI was almost exclusively provided by government suppliers
(the Woreda agriculture offices) regardless of market quality, whereas in India a more mixed picture
emerged. Here, government suppliers were also important but we found evidence that private AI
suppliers were providing a growing share of AI services, particularly in high and medium market
quality sites (Supplementary Table 4).

The charges for insemination services were generally low relative to true costs in Ethiopia at
around 0.30 USD per attempt. In India, charges were higher at around 2 USD per insemination. While
the price of government AI service decreased with market quality (0.31 v. 0.25 USD
per service in high and low market quality sites in Ethiopia; 1.76 v. 1.38 USD per
service in high and low market quality sites in India), private suppliers were asking for double the
charge in low market quality sites compared with high market quality sites (4.07 v.
1.87 USD per service in India in low and high market quality sites; no private suppliers in high
market quality sites in Ethiopia) indicating the costs of poorer market access (Supplementary Table
4).

Trends in dairy development over the past 10 years
As part of this study, milk producers were asked about their perception of trends in dairy
development over the past decade to provide an overall picture on how things are changing and what
can be expected in coming years. We should emphasise that these are perception data and should be
treated with caution. When asked about changing herd sizes, respondents in medium and low market
quality sites in both India and Ethiopia indicated that herd sizes are declining. In high market
quality sites there was a more mixed picture suggesting fairly static overall herd size in these
sites. In contrast, the amount of milk produced per household was reported to have increased in
high-quality sites in both India and Ethiopia indicating improved productivity per cow and this was
borne out by responses to questions about changing per cow productivity over the past decade. This
pattern was not sustained in medium and low market quality sites in Ethiopia with respondents
reporting an overall decline in the amount of milk produced per household in these sites. When asked
about productivity respondents reported a mixed picture suggesting fairly static productivity. A
similar pattern was found in Indian sites except that respondents reported increasing productivity
in medium market quality sites (Figure 1).Figure 1 Trends in dairy development over the past 10 years (percentage of responses) from the perspective
of milk producers.




Sales of milk by producers were reported to have increased in all sites and the effect was
particularly strong in high market quality sites, as expected. The patterns in Ethiopia and India
were similar. Sale of milk products was also reported to have increased in Ethiopia, especially in
high market quality sites but this contrasted with data from India which showed a decline in sale of
milk products especially in high market quality sites. Dairy-derived income was reported to have
increased in all sites in both India and Ethiopia and the effect was particularly strong in the high
market quality sites (Figure 1).

Finally, respondents were asked about changes in feeding practices and some strong trends
emerged. Respondents reported an increase in stall feeding and a decrease in grazing across all
levels of market quality in both India and Ethiopia. The decline of grazing was less pronounced for
India with some producers reporting an increase in grazing (Figure
1).

Discussion
The current study examined the influence of market quality of dairy production in India and
Ethiopia on production intensity, characterised mainly by farm-level feeding and breeding practices.
The market quality gradient we studied in both India and Ethiopia provides a snapshot of how the
systems are developing in the two countries and could provide pointers to the future. Systematic
research on dairy systems in Ethiopia is scarce and there are few widely available studies with good
primary data on farm-level practices. Data are available on reproductive performance of cross-bred
and indigenous dairy cows but mainly at station level or in very limited areas that have been
subject to favourable dairy development initiatives (Haile-Mariam et al., 1993; Shiferaw et al., 2003; Demeke et al., 2004; Lobago et al., 2007). Data
on farm level feeding practices is scarce although some relatively generic adoption data are
available (Mekonnen et al., 2010). Many
development projects have, over the years, focused their activities on the Addis Ababa milkshed and
there are few studies which take a wider geographical perspective (see Yigrem et
al., 2008). Data on dairy production in India are,
of course, more widespread (Gupta, 1981; Patil and Udo,
1997; Staal et al., 2008) but comparisons with Africa are less common.

In terms of livestock feeding, results show that market quality stimulates stall feeding and the
use of concentrates. The data indicate an increase in stall feeding at the expense of grazing as
systems intensify. This is also borne out by the trends section and is in line with what would be
expected as systems intensify (Bebe and Udo, 2008). The
share of grazing as a percentage of the total diet was generally higher in Ethiopia reflecting the
less intensive nature of dairy production. The overall composition of stall-fed material was
remarkably similar in Ethiopia and India with dry fodder (mainly crop residues) accounting for the
major share of the diet with green fodder also contributing a significant proportion. The dominance
of crop residue in livestock diets in Ethiopia is in agreement with broad estimates in other studies
(Bediye and Feyissa, 2007). Concentrates were also important
especially in the more intensive sites. However, the data do not allow any conclusions to be drawn
on the quality of these concentrates. Studies in Uganda show that commercial dairy concentrates are
highly variable in quality and often show nutritive values far below those stated by sellers (Lukuyu
et al., 2012).

On the breeding side, results show that market quality is associated with a higher proportion of
improved cows. This suggests that the major gains in production in high market quality sites are
associated with increased numbers of cross-bred cows being fed the better feed they need to keep
producing. Moreover, improved breeding techniques are also generally associated with higher market
quality. While AI is predominantly used in cross-bred cows in both countries irrespective of market
quality, market quality stimulates the use of AI on indigenous cows, thereby increasing the share of
cross-bred cows. In Ethiopia where the AI service is underdeveloped, market quality stimulates the
use of improved bulls. Private AI services, generally more responsive to farmer demands, are more
prevalent in higher and medium market quality sites in India, indicating the importance of private
dairy services as systems intensify. In Ethiopia private AI provision is minimal. Previous studies
have pointed to the dysfunctional nature of the Ethiopian AI system (Gebremedhin, 2008). Costs of AI services generally reduce as market quality
increases indicating that improved market quality helps to reduce the cost of AI service delivery
and therefore where market quality is low, that access to AI services will continue to be dependent
on public subsidised services.

On the husbandry side we found that the improved feeding regimes at the high-quality sites were
not closely reflected in the expected positive effects on daily milk yield moving up the market
quality gradient. Reproductive parameters such as calving intervals and age at first calving show
only minor improvements in high market quality sites. While daily milk yields per animal do not
improve as systems intensify in India, we do find small productivity increases in the Ethiopian high
market quality sites. At this stage, it is difficult to identify causes for this lack of strong
productivity increases. Part of the increased concentrate consumption can be explained by the
replacement of indigenous cows with cross-bred cows, especially in Ethiopia, where concentrate
differences are smaller and the breed replacement stronger. However, in India only 20% of the dairy
herd is affected by this change; buffaloes continuously represent over 50% in all quality sites. The
reasons for this apparent disconnect between inputs and outputs need further investigation. First,
data issues could be responsible. While breeding practices and the proportion of cross-bred and
indigenous cows in the herd are easy to recall, average milk yield may not be an ideal variable for
group interviews. Similarly, considering diet composition for the overall herd may mask links
between feed inputs and milk outputs for individual animals. Second, the quality of concentrates
replacing grazing and fodder is not assessed. In many cases, cereal milling products are classified
as concentrates despite their relatively low nutrient density. Third, differences in feeding may
have led to varying milk composition and this was not recorded.

Despite the limited effect on daily milk yield, the calculated average annual milk yields are
higher in high-quality sites, mainly because of the combined effects of reducing the duration of
unproductive periods through a combination of reduced calving interval and a shorter dry period.
Most of the farm-level productivity increases linked to milk market quality appear to be based on
improving genetic material rather than to changes in management. From a farmer’s point of view this
seems rational as moving from indigenous to cross-bred cows brings considerable benefits for milk
yield with only a moderate investment in AI, as long as sufficient fodder at reasonable quality
levels is available. On the other hand, increasing milk yield through improved nutrition alone
requires specialist knowledge of nutritional management of cows which is often lacking. Our data on
calving interval and age at first calving are broadly in line with those found in other studies
(Lobago et al., 2007; Shiferaw et
al., 2003) although other studies have not looked
at variation along an intensification gradient.

The data presented in this study are not, it should be stated, representative of national data.
States/Regions were specifically selected for variation and importance in dairy production, while an
equal number of Districts/Woredas were selected per quality class in each State/Region, irrespective
of the distribution of these classes. Indeed, in Ethiopia, the data seems to be skewed in favour of
more intensive producers. The data are useful, however, especially in terms of seeing the overall
effect of market quality, trends within country and for cross-country comparison purposes.

Conclusions
In terms of scope for improvement, our evidence suggests that the quickest gains in Ethiopia are
to be gained by radically improving the AI service in order to upgrade the genetic stock of the
herd. AI still forms a minor share of overall breeding methods in Ethiopia and this reflects the
dysfunctional nature of the AI system in the country. If lessons are to be learned from India and as
previous experiences in Ethiopia show (IPMS, 2011), then
there could be scope for passing responsibility for AI to co-operatives, or improving the enabling
environment for private AI provision. In India, there is less potential for increasing dairy
productivity through improved AI provision. The majority of cross-breds are already serviced by AI
and efficiency is reasonable. However, the prospect of improving the genetic potential of buffaloes,
the main dairy animal in the study sites, through AI is more limited compared with cattle, as
high-yielding exotic breeds do not exist. Nevertheless, improvements in breeding programmes offer
great long-term benefits but require considerable public and private investments.

On the feeding side our data emphasise the importance of crop residues in the feeding of dairy
animals in both India and Ethiopia and in both countries there must be considerable scope for
improving this low-quality material through feed interventions. In both countries there is a trend
towards increased feeding of concentrate feeds. To support this change in feeding pattern
interventions should focus on facilitating supply of concentrate feeds by support to the small
agribusiness sector and improving market links between feed suppliers and smallholder dairy
producers.

A major conclusion of this analysis relates to the role of dairy market development as a pull
factor for intensifying dairy production. Farmers report that dairy production in the low and medium
market quality sites are unstable or declining. Trend data show that overall milk produced at
household level and herd size have been declining over the past 10 years. These results imply that
sustainable intensification of dairy systems require well-developed markets with processing
infrastructure, the policy implication being that governments need to provide appropriate incentives
to cooperatives or the private sector to invest in marketing and processing infrastructure.

In summary, this cross-country comparison of feeding and breeding practices across a gradient of
market quality in two very different countries shows that smallholder dairy systems are in
considerable flux. In Ethiopia, there seems considerable scope for improving the genetic quality of
the herd through support to private or co-operative-based AI services. This would need to be
accompanied by improvements to feed supply notably by making more efficient use of crop residues and
by facilitating access to high-quality concentrate feeds. In India, per cow performance relatively
stable across the intensification gradient. However, only in high-quality market areas does dairy
production appear to be growing. In all Indian sites there is considerable potential to reduce yield
gaps through improved feeding, especially better use of concentrate feed. The importance of
well-developed marketing systems with processing infrastructure stands out in both countries.

1 Throughout the paper we use the term ‘market quality’ as shorthand for the reliability and
attractiveness of milk procurement systems and the delivery of inputs such as improved feed,
veterinary care, improved breeding services and credit. In many cases quality refers not just to
physical infrastructure but to the institutional arrangements around milk procurement and input
supply. In Ethiopia, despite the importance of the informal butter sector, market quality as we
define it refers mainly to channels for liquid milk. However, our data includes both liquid milk and
associated processed products.

households.
