re-useGenetic parameters and environmental factors were estimated for foaling ease (FE) and
stillbirths (SBs) in four breeds of draft horses based on 11 229, 38 877, 35 764 and 13
274 FE and SB scores recorded between 1998 and 2010 for Ardennais (A), Breton (B), Comtois
(C) and Percheron (P), respectively. Incidences for the three FE categories were: easy or
without help 91.0% (A) to 95.4% (B), difficult 3.4% (B) to 7.1% (A) and intervention of a
veterinarian 1.1% (B) to 1.9% (A). The frequency of SB ranged between 5.4% (B) and 9.4%
(A). A multiple-trait threshold animal model was used that included the effects of sex of
foal, region, month, year of foaling, combined maternal age and parity, direct genetic,
maternal genetic and permanent environments. Estimates were obtained using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling. The most unfavourable effect was first parity, which decreased
the probability of easy foaling to 78.6% for A and 88.3% for B. Interaction with age
showed that the risk for first foaling for mares aged 3 years was higher than at 4 or 5 to
9 years. This was also observed for SB with an increased probability of SB at first
foaling of 17.9% (A) or 9.6% (B). The most unfavourable month was found to be the most
frequent month for foaling (April) and not the most demanding months weather-wise
(winter). For FE, direct heritabilities were A 0.27 (0.06), B 0.14 (0.03), C 0.18 (0.03)
and P 0.18 (0.04), and maternal heritabilities were A 0.25 (0.06), B 0.19 (0.04), C 0.12
(0.03) and P 0.21 (0.06). Genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic effects
were A −0.29 (0.14), B −0.39 (0.12), C −0.09 (0.14) and P −0.54 (0.17). For SB, direct
heritabilities were A 0.52 (0.09), B 0.42 (0.04), C 0.28 (0.04) and P 0.39 (0.05), and
maternal heritabilities were A 0.25 (0.05), B 0.10 (0.02), C 0.07 (0.02) and P 0.14
(0.02). Genetic correlations between direct and maternal genetic effects were A −0.85
(0.06), B −0.63 (0.06), C −0.64 (0.11) and P −0.69 (0.06). Direct genetic correlations
between FE and SB traits were A 0.60 (0.10), B 0.58 (0.10), C 0.36 (0.10) and P 0.29
(0.15). Maternal genetic correlations between FE and SB traits were A 0.67 (0.10), B 0.47
(0.13), C 0.28 (0.15) and P 0.39 (0.15). These estimates are posterior means of the Gibbs
samples and are within the upper limits of comparable results reported in cattle.

Implications
Dystocia is a significant cause of female and neonatal death in horse breeding (McCue and
Ferris, 2012). Breeders are generally amateurs who
are not interested in modern genetics. Fortunately, French breeding associations have
recorded data on foaling ease and stillbirths in four breeds of draft horses for over 10
years. By studying gestations in inter-bred mares, it was first evidenced in 1938 and
recently confirmed that the size of the mare regulated foal size (Walton and Hammond, 1938;
Allen et al., 2002). As the biology
of gestation may differ between horses and cattle, this original genetic study has proven
its usefulness. Knowing heritability and genetic correlation between the capacities for a
stallion to produce foals easy to birth and mares easy to foal, breeding values are now
available.

Introduction
In horses, the relative importance of heredity and the environment in the intrauterine
development of foal and foaling difficulties of mares is a long-standing issue, which was
first reported in 1937 by Walton and Hammond in a paper describing spectacular crosses
between Shetland ponies and Shire horses. Their results suggested that foetal growth was
controlled by the mare, hence concealing many genetic differences in the foal. Since then,
the components of dystocia and stillbirths (SBs; gestation length, position and posture of
the foetus, size of mare and foal, placenta characteristics and duration of labour) have
been studied to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to prevent their occurrence (Ginther
and Williams, 1996; Allen et al.,
2002; Allen et al., 2007; Langlois et al., 2012; McCue and Ferris, 2012; Squires et al., 2013). These studies were for the most part conducted on warmblood
horses (thoroughbred, quarter horses) where both the foal and the mare are worth enough to
call for adequate care at foaling. In France, the problem of foaling difficulties was raised
by breeders of heavy horses. They had been recording foaling scores and data on SB for more
than 10 years. Their objective was to improve their breeds by selection on these
characteristics. Recently, statistical tools have become available for estimating both
genetic parameters for complex threshold traits (such as scores) and direct and maternal
effects (such as the biology of dystocia) in animal models. These Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) and Gibbs sampling methods (Lopez de Maturana et al., 2007; Legarra et al., 2011) avoid the biased inference of restricted maximum
likelihood (REML) methodology for binary traits (Moreno et al., 1997).

The aim of this paper was to estimate genetic parameters for dystocia or, a
contrario foaling ease (FE) and SBs, in breeds of draft horses.

Material and methods
Data
French birth registration forms for draft horses include, since 1998, a score to record
the conditions of foaling. In this study, we focused on the main breeds: Breton (B),
Comtois (C), Percheron (P) and a fourth category designated Ardennais (A) including
Ardennais, Auxois, Trait du Nord breeds between which the genetic distance is very small
and that can mate together (Leroy et al., 2009). Only pure bred births from 1998 to 2010 were considered.
Scores for FE were assigned by the breeder: ‘without help’, ‘easy’, ‘difficult’ and
‘intervention of the veterinarian’. It was found to be difficult, both for breeders and
during data analysis, to clearly distinguish between ‘without help’ and ‘easy’. The data
for these two categories were therefore grouped during analysis and we used three ordered
categories: 1=‘without help or easy’, 2=‘difficult’, 3=‘intervention of the veterinarian’.
Data were missing about foaling difficulty on the registration forms in 21% to 30% of
cases, but without any particular distribution depending on the region, maternal age, sex
of foal or sires. Cases of observed dystocia were excluded if the sex of the foal was
missing (1%). Unfortunately the scores for these excluded observations were high with 31%
of the births recorded as ‘difficult’, instead of 3% to 7% in the data retained for
analysis. But as the sex ratio remained close to 50% in the analysed data, we expected the
estimates not to be biased for the effects included in the model. SBs were defined as
foals that were born dead and never showed a detectable heartbeat. The characteristics of
the data sets are provided in Table 1. All
available pedigree data for mares and foals were used in the analysis. Therefore, between
17 231 and 54 932 animals were included in the analysis depending on the breeds (Table 2). The mean number of births per mare ranged
from 2.7 (P) to 3.0 (B) and the mean number of births per sire ranged from 16.5 (A) to
29.8 (P).Table 1 Total number of births, analysed births and distribution of scores for FE and SBs

Method
A threshold mixed model was assumed for each of the traits. This model (Sorensen and
Gianola, 2002) considers one (for binary traits) or
several thresholds (for polychotomous traits) and a liability that, over a given threshold,
produces an observed phenotype. The liability follows a normal distribution and may be
explained by a classical linear model. A multiple-trait threshold linear mixed model with
three categories of observations for FE and two for SB was assumed. Each trait followed the
same model:  where y is the vector of liability for FE or SB, b
the vector of fixed effects, a the vector of random direct additive genetic
effects for the foal, u the vector of random maternal additive genetic effects
for the mare, p the vector of random permanent environmental effects for all
consecutive foalings of the mare, e the vector of residuals and Z,
W are incidence matrices. The distributions of vectors a,
u, p and e were assumed normal with variance
matrices:  where A is the relationship matrix and  Fixed effects were: year of foaling (from 1998 to 2010), month of birth
(January and February, March, May, June, July and after), region of foaling (six regions
covering the traditional areas for each breed and five other large regions), sex of the foal
(male, female), combined maternal age and parity (with F for first foaling, D for the second
and third foaling and M for further parities; the nine levels of this effect were: 3 years
F, 4 years F, 4 years D, 5 to 9 years F, 5 to 9 years D, 5 to 9 years M, 10 years and more
F, 10 years and more D, 10 years and more M). In order to assure correct estimation of all
effects, at least one FE score and SB score was observed for each level of each fixed
effect.

For each trait, the following genetic parameters were defined (subscript omitted): the
phenotypic variance was , the heritability of the direct effect was , the heritability of the maternal effect was , the genetic correlation between maternal and direct effects was , the repeatability between two foalings of the same mare (assuming a
different sire) was . The following parameters were defined between traits: the genetic
correlation between direct effects was , the genetic correlation between maternal effects was  and the phenotypic correlation between FE and SB for the same foaling
was  


To estimate the different parameters, an MCMC Gibbs sampling was used with TM software
(Legarra et al., 2011). For each
population, Gibbs sampling was carried out through a unique chain of 100 000 iterations,
discarding the first 4000 iterations and retaining one every 20 samples.

Estimates for fixed and random effects were obtained for the liability variables. As the
variance of each trait on this underlying scale is unidentifiable, we chose a phenotypic
standard deviation of 1 and all the results in the figures are presented in this phenotypic
standard deviation unit (s.d.). Knowing the estimated thresholds, an estimated probability
to have the different scores for FE or SB for each combination of fixed and random effects
could also be computed from the estimates of the effects and are provided in the text. When
discussing of a particular level of an effect, all other effects (fixed and random) except
the one mentioned are the average of estimates according to their distribution in the actual
data.

Results
Estimates of environmental fixed effects
The year of foaling showed erratic variations because of the particular environmental
conditions of each year but with a clear decrease over time for B (regression coefficient
−0.03 s.d./year) and P (regression coefficient −0.02 s.d./year), which suggested an
improvement of the environmental conditions of foaling. The estimated probabilities for
‘difficult’ or ‘with veterinarian’ births decreased, respectively, from 6.2% before 2000
to 3.1% after 2008 for B, and from 8.1% to 5.3% for P. The amplitude (maximum–minimum) of
variations remained moderate for the other breeds, that is, ∼0.25 s.d. Differences were
observed for SB scores between the four first years recorded (from 1998 to 2001) and
following years, but without improvement from then on. The more favourable months for
foaling (Figure 1) were the rare early foalings
(January and February, frequency of foalings 3% (A) to 8% (B)) or late foalings (June 4%
(B) to 14% (A) and July to September, 2% (B) to 7% (A)). The most unfavourable months were
March to May with a maximum in April. There was no significant month effect for SB. Births
of male foals were found to be more difficult with the same values for B, C and P (+0.17
s.d., +0.18 s.d., +0.16 s.d.) and +0.09 s.d. for A. This leads to an increase of the
probability of difficult foalings or presence of a veterinarian of about 2 points. For SB,
the unfavourable effect of males was higher for C and P (+0.20 s.d., +0.24 s.d.) than A
and B (+0.14 s.d., +0.16 s.d.). Compared with female foals, the probability of SB was
increased by 3 points for C and P for male foals. Foaling was not found to be easier in
the traditional geographical areas for the breeds, but only little variation was observed
between regions and for the most part differences were not significant (<0.20
s.d.). Lower SB scores were observed for B and C in their traditional geographical areas.
The fixed effect of maternal age and parity was the most important. Estimates are plotted
in Figure 2 (except for first parity in mares aged
10 or more for whom standard errors were high due to the low number of cases). Foaling
difficulties were higher both at first parity compared with second or third parity, and at
second and third parity compared with following parities, with a 1.4- to 3.2-fold increase
of the probability to have a FE score of 2 or 3 compared with the mean population. The age
effect was important at age 3 years when the combination of first parity and age resulted
in the highest risk. The differences between the age categories 5–9 years and 4 years were
in favour of the older mares but were not significant in most cases. No significant
differences were noted between mares aged 5–9 years and 10 years or more. Interactions
were observed between age and parity effects; except for breed C. Foaling was more
difficult if first parity occurs at age 5–9 years than at age 4 years for A, but the
opposite was observed for P. The effect of maternal age and parity showed exactly the same
pattern for SB.Figure 1 Effect of month of foaling on liability of foaling ease, expressed relative to

Genetic parameters

Table 3 provides the estimated genetic parameters
as posterior means of Gibbs sampler output and their standard deviations in parenthesis.
For FE, repeatability was homogeneous among breeds: from 0.26 (P) to 0.32 (A). Direct
heritability ranged from 0.14 (B) to 0.27 (A) and maternal heritability ranged from 0.12
(C) to 0.25 (A). Maternal heritability was lower than direct heritability for A and C, and
higher for B and P. Genetic correlations were unfavourable for three of the breeds with
values ranging from −0.54 (P) to −0.29 (A), and almost neutral for C (−0.09).
Additionally, in order to test the robustness of these results, single trait analysis was
performed with only two classes for foaling difficulties, that is, with by pooling the
‘difficult’ and ‘with veterinarian’ categories to increase the relative proportion of
occurrences for this category in the data set. In this case, differences in estimates of
genetic parameters were negligible (<0.04 point) except for the genetic correlation
between maternal and direct effect for C (−0.25) associated with higher direct
heritability (0.27).Table 3 Genetic parameters of foaling ease in four breeds of draft horses (s.d. in

For SB, repeatability was also homogeneous among breeds: from 0.10 (C) to 0.14 (A).
Direct heritability of SB ranged from 0.28 (C) to 0.52 (A) and was higher than for FE.
Maternal heritability ranged from 0.07 (C) to 0.25 (A), and was both lower than maternal
heritability for FE and direct heritability in all breeds. Genetic correlations were very
unfavourable for all breeds and ranged from −0.63 (B) to −0.85 (A). The correlations
between the two traits, FE and SB, were always positive and strong whatever the direct or
maternal genetic effects especially for A and B, with a similar phenotypic correlation in
all breeds of ∼0.60.

Discussion
The data included in the present study were sufficiently consistent and unselected to be
used for genetic analysis. We failed to understand the causes of environmental improvement
for FE for B and P with time (year effect) and change of the interpretation of scoring with
time cannot be entirely excluded. In the same way, differences observed for SB in the four
first years without improvement from then on, may be due to the way that observations are
recorded (choice between SB and early mortality of a live foal). The estimates of
environmental effects obtained here show the importance of maternal age and parity. There is
always a risk at first foaling, especially if the mare is aged 3 years, so it may be
preferable to wait and breed older mares. Ageing did not affect either FE or SBs as the risk
was identical for mares aged 5 to 9 years and 10 years or more. The negative effect
associated with ageing probably appears later on in life, for very old mares, as culling is
higher from age 16 years, although it is also linked to fertility. These results are not in
agreement with Allen et al. (2007)
who reported a lower percentage of pregnancies in which the foal was born dead for young (3
to 8 years) and maiden thoroughbred mares, although the differences were not significant.
Squires et al. (2013) also
reported significantly lower dystocia (8.5%) for maiden mares compared with multiparous
mares (14.2% for foaling mares and 12.7% for barren mares), again in thoroughbreds. Our
results were comparable to those reported by Langlois et al. (2012) when they analysed gestation losses (i.e. between
diagnosis of gestation and birth). They observed that gestation losses were lowest in mares
aged 7 to 10 years and that mares with a foal at foot had an advantage over other mares,
confounding barren and maiden mares. However, their study included all gestation losses and
not just SBs even though it was assumed that SBs represented most of losses (185 detailed
gestations were observed in which a third of losses occurred during the 11 months).

The unfavourable effect of first parity on dystocia and SB is well established in both
dairy cattle (Meyer et al., 2000;
Meyer et al., 2001a; Meyer
et al., 2001b; Luo et
al., 2002; Steinbock et
al., 2003; Steinbock et
al., 2006; Lopez de Maturana et
al., 2007) and beef cattle (Carnier
et al., 2000; Phocas and Laloe,
2004). We can therefore conclude that heavy
horses are closer to cattle in this respect than to warmblood horses, that is, for breeding
and horse management techniques, or possible mix-up between the maternal age and parity
reported.

The estimates of month effects could be used to provide helpful advice for breeders. The
fact that foaling difficulties were higher during the most frequent months for foaling
(compared with months when the weather conditions can be an issue as in the winter or
summer) suggest that this is probably more because of the lack of time for watching over the
mares during this busy period, and thus a higher FE score, than to climatic reasons. It
should be noted that no month effect was observed for SB. No differences in the incidence of
dystocia depending on the month of parturition were reported by Squires et
al. (2013) and an increase of gestation
losses was observed by Langlois et al. (2012) for mares that were bred during month of last mating. In dairy cattle, on
the contrary, winter months are the less favourable (Steinbock et al.,
2003; Eaglen and Bijma, 2009).

The aim of this study was to provide estimated breeding values (EBVs) for breeders in order
to improve the populations and avoid matings that could put mare and foal at risk. Although
these tools are commonly used in other species, they are still novel for horse breeders. The
high heritabilities of the direct effect for SB were unexpected and suggest that this is the
best trait to select on. However, because of the high negative genetic correlation between
direct and maternal effects, the repeatability between foalings of the same mare remained
low, and lower than for FE (mean of 0.12 for SB v. 0.28 for FE). The
parameters for SB therefore seemed less reliable than those for FE. However, given the high
genetic correlation between the two traits, a multiple-trait model should benefit from
observations on both FE and SB. EBVs for FE are now calculated and available for breed
leaders and will be soon for SB. Two values are provided for sires when reliability is
>0.20: facility of foaling (maternal genetic value) and facility of birth (direct
genetic value). Nevertheless, based on to the unfavourable genetic correlation between
direct and maternal effects that we have evidenced in this study for A, B and P, it will be
difficult to select sires that will both contribute to improving the FE of the mares mated
with them and the FE of their daughters. This might not be the case for C because a negative
correlation was only found for this breed when the ‘difficult’ and ‘with veterinarian’
scores were considered together and because the heritability of SB was much lower. This
could be explained by the smaller size and weight of this breed and suggests that these
results should not be generalised to all non-hypermetric breeds including warmbloods.

Various differences were observed between the breeds in this analysis. For FE, they are the
same as those described by Langlois et al. (2012) for foetal losses. However, for SB they differ from those
reported previously in C and P breeds (in this study we observed that SB was higher in C
than P, whereas in the previous report higher gestation losses were observed in P and
Boulonnais than in C). This could be due to the differences in format and weight of the
horses or to differences in breeding management. P is the heaviest and tallest breed (900 to
1000 kg, 1 m 68); the other breeds are smaller (700 to 800 kg, 1 m 58 to 1 m 60). The age at
first foaling is younger for C (mean 4.2) and B (mean 4.3) than for A and P (mean 4.6). This
lower age at first foaling is due to a higher number of foalings at 3 years for C (27%
compared with 3% to 9% in other breeds) and 4 years for B (70% compared with 49% to 65% in
other breeds). For B, foalings preferably occur at the beginning of the year (33% before
April compared with 14% to 25% for the other breeds). For A, foalings preferably occur late
in the year (21% after May compared with 6% to 13% in other breeds). The heaviest breed did
not show the highest rate of foaling difficulties. Indeed these reached 9.0% in the most
unfavourable case, that is, breed A, but only 6.7% in the heaviest breed P. This perhaps
results from an adaptation in breeding practices: because the highest FE scores are observed
in P and A, breeders have, over the years, chosen to use older mares for first foalings than
C and B. This was highlighted in our analysis by the unfavourable interaction between age 3
and first parity compared with the effect of first parity at age 4 or 5 to 9. For the month
effect, all breeds showed a similar curve for FE with a maximum of births in April. The
absence of a month effect on SB is also common to all breeds even if the number of births
per month varied between breeds. This reinforces the stability of our results in spite of
the low occurrence of FE and SB. Only breed A, with their late foalings from June to
September, has taken advantage of favourable effects.

No references could be found in the literature on genetic parameters for dystocia in horse
breeding. In dairy cattle, the heritability of the direct effect for calving ease (CE)
ranged from 0.01 with raw data to 0.19 with a threshold model, and the heritability of the
maternal effect ranged from 0.02 with a threshold model to 0.14 with raw data (Luo
et al., 2002; Steinbock
et al., 2003; Wiggans et
al., 2003; Hansen et
al., 2004; Jamrozik et
al., 2005; Steinbock et
al., 2006; Lopez de Maturana et
al., 2007
2009a and 2009b; Eaglen and Bijma, 2009; Johanson
et al., 2011; Eaglen et
al., 2012). Appreciably higher estimates
were obtained in beef cattle (Varona et al., 1999; Carnier et al., 2000; Phocas and Laloe, 2003, 2004) with
direct heritability within the range 0.09 to 0.27, maternal heritability within the range
0.06 to 0.18 and genetic correlation within the range −0.19 to −0.55. The most recent
references used, as in our analysis, a threshold animal model and obtained heritability in
the upper range for dairy cattle: 0.11 and 0.05 to 0.14 for direct and maternal effects,
respectively (Johanson et al., 2011; Eaglen et al., 2012).
Typically the direct heritability estimate was twice the magnitude of the maternal
heritability estimate. It is common for genetic correlations between direct and maternal
effects to be negative but they are often moderate and sometimes positive (Luo et
al., 2002; Hansen et
al., 2004), although the most recent
studies using the threshold animal model reported more negative estimates (−0.37 to −0.67).
For SBs, genetic parameters are of the same magnitude (Steinbock et al.,
2003; Hansen et al., 2004; Jamrozik et al., 2005; Steinbock et al., 2006; Lopez de Maturana et al., 2009b;
Johanson et al., 2011; Eaglen
et al., 2012) with a very low
heritability (0.00 to 0.15) but always a high genetic correlation between SB and CE (0.39 to
0.83). Compared with these results, our estimates are quite high for FE and very high for
SB. The trait seemed to be distributed identically in the two species. The frequency of CE
is very similar, considering only difficult calvings and those with veterinarian assistance:
from 3% to ∼8%, and up to 14% for first calving in the previous listed references (except
for the specialised Italian Piedmontese beef cattle breed in Carnier et
al., 2000). The frequency of SB is also
very similar from 3.1% to 13.1%. As in our study, differences between low scores (easy or
easy with moderate assistance) depended on the data and were not as relevant as the
threshold for difficulties. Hence, the differences of the estimates for genetic parameters
do not depend on differences of incidence of the trait between horses and cattle.
Nevertheless, horse breeds are not managed in the same way as cattle: the proportion of
first parity in our data (20%) was low compared with that for dairy cattle (often more than
50%), the number of parities for a given animal was higher (mean 3.8 for C to 4.2 for A) and
the lifespan was also longer in horses (mean age 7.9 for B to 8.5 for A). Therefore, based
on differences in biology, management, maternal age and parity, the trait may well be
different. This is also supported by the estimates of the fixed effect. In Hansen et
al. (2004) and Eaglen and Bijma (2009), the age effect showed a linear increase with time
leading to a reduction of calving difficulties but without reaching, as in our study, a
plateau level from age 5 to 9 on. But this could be because of the fact that these studies
only included cows up to age 3 to 4 years, whereas our study included horse up to age 20
years. In horses, the choice of age at first foaling is a possibility. Only 3% to 9% of A, B
and P mares foaled at age 3 years, which is the regulatory possibility and more or less the
biological limit (foaling at 2 years old might be possible). The great majority of mares
began their reproductive life at 4 years and there are still new mares after 6 years (B: 8%
to P: 14%). This particularity meant we were able to calculate the interaction between age
and parity, and comfort breeders in their choice to avoid foaling before age 3 years for
less difficult births.

It is interesting to go back to the very first study that tried to distinguish between
heredity, environment, maternal and direct effects on the size of foals (Walton and Hammond,
1938) and comment what has been learnt since
then. Most studies have focused on the mechanistic effects of the mares on foaling: McCue
and Ferris (2012) and Ginther and Williams (1996) showed that abnormal foetal postures and longer
stage II labour increased mortality. Gestation length is also a well-known factor: McCue and
Ferris (2012) found higher SB rates for short or
long gestation lengths. In a protocol similar to that of Walton and Hammond (1938), Allen et al. (2002) showed that foal weight is regulated by the mare
by transferring a pony embryo into the uterus of a thoroughbred mare, and reciprocal
transfer of thoroughbred embryos into pony mares. They analysed the placenta and proved that
weight at birth is determined by the total microscopic area of foetomaternal contact, which
is the product of the density of microcotyledons on the allantochorion, a function of the
mare regardless the breed of foetus, and the volume of the allantochorion, which is
determined by both the genetics of the mare and of the foal. Information of this kind was
not available in our study and therefore we can only conclude on the mare or foal effect as
a percentage of unexplained variance. The high direct heritability of FE (mean 0.19)
suggests that the importance of the foal was perhaps underestimated in these previous
studies. In fact, the mare provides half of the direct effect to her foal (a quarter of the
variance) and the entire maternal effect with moderate negative correlation (mean −0.33). So
the influence of the mares, added to the common environmental effect, reached 28% (mean of
repeatability), whereas the sire effect is of only a quarter of the direct effect, that is,
5%. The influence of the mare observed here is therefore compatible with the genetic
parameters obtained.

Conclusion
This study is the first to report the estimation of the genetic parameters for dystocia and
SBs in horses. The ranges of heritabilities were around the upper limits of those reported
for cattle in the literature, especially for SBs. On the basis of our results, breeders
should be advised to avoid mating at age 3 years and to be particularly vigilant in the busy
spring months when most foals are born. The EBVs produced will provide breeders with
additional information on sires. It should be noted though that we will have to wait at
least 5 years before being able to provide EBVs for the maternal effect in stallions. In
order to partially alleviate this problem and provide genetic information on an earlier
basis, we plan to obtain information on morphological traits and expect to find a
correlation between one or several morphological criteria and direct or maternal effects on
dystocia.
