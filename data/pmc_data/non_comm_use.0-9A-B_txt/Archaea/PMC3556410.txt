==== Body
After our paper was published online, we found an error in the last paragraph of the introduction. The word “mitigated” in the sentence “We showed that under aerobic conditions, compatible solutes accumulated by thermophilic bacteria confer IR resistance to enzymes in vitro and that radioprotection is mitigated by the presence of both trehalose and Mn2+” should be correctly written as “mediated.”
