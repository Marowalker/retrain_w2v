Dear Editor,

I read with interest the article titled “Medical Record Review for Faculty Promotion: A Cohort Analysis” [1], which is being published in the Biomedical Journal. I honestly thank the authors of this publication as this manuscript has provided novel information to us. Reviewing the case sheet and discharge summary, will provide all the details of the diagnosis of that particular disease, which patient had suffered from. It also reflects the quality of treatment, which was offered to the patient. One can figure out the efficiency of the treating physician, in making an accurate diagnosis, the suitable investigations and the treatment given, after reviewing the medical record documents.

Considering the review of the medical record, for the promotion of a faculty is really an enlightening idea among the medical community. Promotion in the medical academics continues to be connected with one's scholarly productivity [2]. Most of the medical institutions/universities across the world, consider the years of experience/service of the faculty and scientific publications, which he/she has done, for the promotion. Getting the internal and external auditing of the medical records of the faculty/department is also wonderful. The external auditing has become much easier with the adoption of EMR (electronic medical record). However, these criteria of considering the medical record, for the promotion will only apply to the clinical faculty and it is not applicable to the basic sciences faculty. The pre-clinical and para-clinical faculties are not directly involved in the patient care.

I congratulate the authors for this scientific publication, which has provided the novel concepts of the faculty promotion, which can be implemented in the teaching hospitals across the world.
