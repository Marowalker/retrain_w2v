By measuring the prevalence of neuronal traffic between two brain structures based on the notion that diffusion of water molecules along the axon in parallel bundles will create prominent anisotropy in the direction of the passage of action potentials, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be taken as an effective tool for functional investigations. Demonstration of complementary results obtained from synchronized DTI of the baroreflex neural circuit and physiological or pathophysiological evaluation of baroreflex functionality should validate this notion.

Methods
We implemented concurrent changes in neuronal traffic within the neural circuit of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone in the brain stem and alterations of its experimental surrogate under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We further evaluated the functional and clinical implications of results obtained from this experimental paradigm in conjunction with baroreflex induction and a mevinphos intoxication model of brain stem death.

Results
We found that robust connectivity existed between the nucleus tractus solitarii and rostral ventrolateral medulla, the afferent and efferent nuclei of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor. Intriguingly, this connectivity was either reversibly disrupted or irreversibly severed to reflect alterations in baroreflex responses to physiological or pathophysiological challenges.

Conclusions
The capability to observe simultaneous and complementary changes in neuronal traffic within the neural circuit of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and alterations of its experimental surrogate that bears technical, scientific and clinical implications sustains the notion that coupled with relevant physiological phenotypes, DTI can be an effective investigative tool for functional evaluations of brain stem activities.

Scientific background on the subject
By measuring the prevalence of neuronal traffic between two brain structures based on the notion that diffusion of water molecules along the axon in parallel bundles will create prominent anisotropy in the direction of the passage of action potentials, diffusion tensor imaging is an effective tool for functional investigations.

What this study adds to the field
Demonstration of simultaneous and complementary changes in neuronal traffic within the baroreflex neural circuit and physiological or pathophysiological evaluation of baroreflex functionality sustains the notion that coupled with relevant physiological phenotypes; diffusion tensor imaging can be an effective investigative tool for functional assessment of brain stem activities.



Based on physiological (stimulation and lesion), anatomical (tracers), pharmacological (agonists and antagonists) approaches [1,2] and Fos expression [3,4], the neural circuit in the brain stem for baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone has been well established. The key substrates in this neural circuit include the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) where primary baroreceptor afferents terminate, the caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla (CVLM and RVLM), and the sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the thoracic spinal cord. Myriad of publications on normal and abnormal baroreflex functionality has appeared over the last few decades under the assumption that neuronal traffic, or the lack of it, within this neural circuit underpins the execution of short-term and long-term baroreflex regulation of blood pressure (BP). Nevertheless, until recently (see Ref. [5] for review), whether neuronal traffic in the above-mentioned circuit actually takes place in the brain stem during the execution of baroreflex has never been visualized.

Using diffusion of water molecules as the probe to offer information on diffusion anisotropy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been widely used in studies on normal and abnormal functions of forebrain structures [[6], [7], [8]]. Unlike the forebrain, application of DTI to the brain stem, which requires extraordinary efforts to fine tune the scanning parameters and enhance signal detection, is relatively wanting. Based on successful execution of tractographic analysis of the medulla oblongata in mice [[9], [10], [11], [12]] and rats [13], it has been reported that by measuring the prevalence of traffic within the baroreflex neural circuits based on diffusion anisotropy created in the direction of the passage of action potentials, DTI can be an effective investigative tool for functional evaluations of baroreflex activities when coupled with measurement of relevant cardiovascular phenotypes. Since all the hitherto reports were based on temporal correlation of imaging and physiological results obtained independently but under comparable experimental conditions, implementation of concurrent DTI of the baroreflex neural circuit and evaluation of baroreflex functionality will obviously render confidence that in addition to morphological or pathological evaluations, tractographic analysis can be an effective investigative tool for functional evaluations of brain stem activities.

The goals of this study are two-folded. Our first goal was to implement concurrent tractographic analysis of the baroreflex neural circuit and evaluation of baroreflex functionality in the rat that exhibits stability, versatility and fidelity. Our second goal was to evaluate the physiological and pathophysiological implications of results obtained from simultaneous changes of DTI events in the brain stem and baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone in conjunction with baroreflex induction and a mevinphos intoxication model of brain stem death.

Materials and methods
Ethics statement
All the experimental procedures engaged in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (IACUC approval number: 2015110502), and were in compliance with the guidelines for animal care and use set forth by that committee. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering during the experiment and reduce the number of animals used.

Animals
Male adult Sprague–Dawley rats (287–336 g, n = 44) purchased from BioLASCO or the Experimental Animal Center of the Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, were used. Animas were housed in an AAALAC International-accredited Center for Laboratory Animals, with maintained room temperature (24 ± 1 °C) and 12-h light–dark cycles. Rats were allowed to acclimatize for at least 7 days after delivery prior to experimental manipulations. Standard laboratory rat chow and tap water were available ad libitum. Animals were assigned in random to be included in the baroreflex-induction group, or to receive treatment with saline or mevinphos.

Recording and power spectral analysis of blood pressure signals
Animals received surgery under an initial pentobarbital sodium anesthesia (50 mg kg−1, i.p.) to prepare them for concurrent BP recording, DTI procedures and drug administration [Fig. 1]. Because of the static magnetic field inherent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we paid particular attention to avoid using ferromagnetic materials for catheterization. For this purpose, a fiber-optic miniature pressure measurement system using an ultra-miniature sensor (Samba Preclin 420LP-BIOPAC TSD174A; BIOPAC System, Goleta, CA, USA) was used to cannulate the femoral artery, and a polyethylene tubing (Intramedic PE-20, Clay Adams, Parsippany, NJ, USA) was used for the femoral vein. BP signals recorded from the femoral artery by the sensor were connected to an Optical Pressure Control Unit (Samba 202-BIOPAC MPMS100A-2) placed outside the magnetic field confines [Fig. 1] via a 4-m long fiberglass wire. In some experiments, BP was recorded conventionally by a strain-gauge transducer (BD DTXPlus™, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) connected to the femoral artery via a polyethylene tubing (Intramedic PE-50, Clay Adams).Fig. 1 Experimental setup for synchronized DTI analysis of the baroreflex neural circuit and physiological and pathophysiological evaluations of baroreflex functionality in the rat. Green box represents the magnetic field confines that necessitate using the fiber-optic pressure sensor and fiber glass cable (red line) to connect blood pressure signals detected from the femoral artery to the optical pressure control unit for subsequent real-time spectral analysis of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) signals. Intravenous administration of saline or mevinphos was delivered via a cannulated femoral vein (blue line).

Fig. 1

During the recording session, which routinely commenced at least 60 min after pentobarbital induction, animals were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane delivered to the MR bore chamber or via a rat anesthesia mask. In all cases, the recorded BP signals were digitized and processed by an arterial blood pressure analyzer (APR31a, Notocord Systems, Croissy-Sur-Seine, France) based on feature extraction to characterize the BP cycles. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were derived from the BP waveforms on a beat-by-beat basis. Continuous, on-line and real-time spectral analysis of SBP signals (SPA10a, Notocord) [14] based on fast Fourier transform was used to detect temporal fluctuations of the low-frequency (BLF) component (0.25–0.8 Hz) in the SBP spectrum. Based on its reduction that mirrors the augmentation of BP [15], and its elimination by sinoaortic denervation [16,17], the power density of the BLF component of the SBP spectrum has been validated to reflect the magnitude of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone.

Magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging of baroreflex neural circuits in the brain stem
We employed a 9.4T horizontal-bore animal MR scanning system (Biospec 94/20, Bruker, Ettingen, Germany) for sequential MRI/DTI acquisition. This scanning system is made up of a 20-cm clear bore and a gradient insert (BGA-12S; 12-cm inner diameter) that offers a maximal gradient strength of 675 mT m−1 and a minimum slew rate of 4673 Tm−1 s−1. It is equipped with a rat brain receiver-only coil array using a circular polarized transmitter coil for signal detection from the head. Although the magnet is self-shielded, a room was built around the magnet to create a controlled access area with the borders defined by the 0.5 mT (5 Gauss) contour line of the static magnetic field. During the recording session, animals were anesthetized with 1% isoflurane and the body temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a warm water circulation system.

As a routine, several imaging sequences were executed to evaluate the connectivity between key brain stem neural substrates in the neural circuit of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone. High resolution T2-weighted sagittal anatomical reference images were first recorded using multislice turbo rapid acquisition with refocusing echoes sequence to provide the landmark structures for orientation [Fig. 2A]. This was followed by T2-weighted coronal anatomical reference imaging on 11 adjacent slices without gap from a restricted area of the brain stem that covered the medullary portion of the NTS and RVLM or CVLM [Fig. 2B]. Employing identical spatial dimension as in the T2-weighted coronal reference imaging, we evaluated the connectivity between the NTS and RVLM or CVLM, using the spin echo-planar imaging-DTI sequence in the same coronal plane. Imaging the bilateral pyramidal tracts was used as the negative control.Fig. 2 (A) High resolution T2-weighted sagittal anatomical reference image showing demarcation of the area of the brain stem (rectangular box) that was subjected to tractographic analysis with DTI.

Fig. 2

Post-processing of the image data entailed an analysis of fiber tractography between the NTS and CVLM or RVLM on both sides of each animal, using the National Taiwan University DSI studio (http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org). In addition, region-of-interest (ROI)-based analysis was performed [18,19] to quantify a conventional DTI index, fractional anisotropy (FA) [Fig. 2C], which is a scalar value that ranges from 0 (isotropy) to 1 (maximum anisotropy) to describe the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process, calculated from the eigenvalues (λ1, λ2, λ3). For example, based on the anatomical locations of the NTS and RVLM in the T2-weighted coronal images [Fig. 2B] and making reference to a rat stereotaxic atlas [20], two ROIs were marked manually on corresponding areas in the FA map on each side of the brain stem [Fig. 2C]. The ROI dimensions for each NTS and RVLM were respectively 3 × 6 and 2 × 4 pixels [Fig. 2C]. Starting from the seeds of ROIs, the fiber tracking algorithm proceeded to seek adjacent voxels whose main diffusion direction was in the continuity of the previous one. Representative colors for tractography in color-encoded FA maps [Fig. 2D] were: blue, caudal-rostral; red, left-right; and green, dorsal-ventral. The correct locations of NTS and RVLM on the FA maps were further verified against histological sections of the brain stem at corresponding levels from the same rat [Fig. 2E].

Induction of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone
In our physiological evaluation of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone, we measured the reflex cardiovascular responses to an increase in BP induced by infusion of norepinephrine (NE; 4 mg kg−1 h−1) into the femoral vein for 30 min using a MRI compatible syringe pump (PHD 2000; Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Temporal alterations in the connectivity between NTS and CVLM or RVLM and the concurrent changes in MAP, power density of the BLF component or HR were measured using a time-window of 30 min.

Mevinphos intoxication model of brain stem death
In our pathophysiological evaluation of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone, we employed a mevinphos intoxication model of brain stem death [21]. Mevinphos (Phosdrin; 3-[dimethoxyphosphosphinyl-oxyl]-2-butenoic acid methyl ester) is a US Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Category I organophosphate. Because of its mode of cardiovascular action, changes in MAP induced by mevinphos are consequential to its actions on the brain stem to elicit an increase followed by a decrease or disappearance of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone [14,22]. Since defunct baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone has been demonstrated to be causally related to brain stem death in comatose patients [[23], [24], [25]], the mevinphos intoxication model is suitable for an additional proof-of-principle demonstration of the pathophysiological implication of synchronized DTI of the baroreflex neural circuit and analysis of baroreflex functionality. Temporal alterations in the connectivity between NTS and CVLM or RVLM elicited by intravenous administration of mevinphos (Sigma‐Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at its LD50 dose (960 μg kg−1) and the concurrent changes in power density of the BLF component, MAP or HR were measured using a time-window of 30 min. Intravenous injection of the same amount of normal saline served as the vehicle and volume control.

Histology
The brain stem was removed immediately after animals were killed with an over-dose of pentobarbital and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm thickness) were stained by neutral red solution (1%) for 1 min, rinsed with distilled water, dehydrated with ethanol and cleared with xylene for histological verifications.

Statistical analyses
All values are given as mean ± SD. The temporal changes in FA, averaged value of MAP, HR or power density of BLF component in the SBP spectrum calculated every 30 min before or after administration of NE, saline or mevinphos were used for statistical analyses. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to assess group means, followed by the Dunnett or Scheffé multiple range test for post hoc assessment of individual means. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To better illustrate the spread of data points, group data were additionally presented as group scatter plots.

Results
Visualizing the neural circuit in brain stem for baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone
Because of the size of the medulla oblongata, tractographic analysis of the baroreflex neural circuit demands extraordinary efforts to fine tune the scanning parameters to supplement the enhancement of signal detection by hardware. Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 present the results of our systematic optimization of the scanning parameters for T2-weighted sagittal anatomical reference imaging of the brain [Table 1], coronal anatomical imaging of a restricted brain stem area that contains the medullary portion of NTS, RVLM or CVLM [Table 2], and imaging the connectivity between these medullary nuclei using spin echo-planar imaging-DTI sequence [Table 3]. Based on those scanning parameters, robust connectivity [Fig. 2D] between histologically verified [Fig. 2E] NTS and RVLM was consistently and amply detected.Table 1 Optimal parameters for T2-weighted sagittal anatomical reference imaging of the brain of the rat, using multislice turbo rapid acquisition with refocusing echoes (Turbo-RARE) sequence.

We recognize that the contemporary dogma [1,2] stipulates that the CVLM participates in baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone by acting as a synaptic relay that connects the NTS to the RVLM. Functionally, CVLM exerts an inhibitory action on RVLM neurons involved in the tonic and reflex control of sympathetic vasomotor tone. Interestingly, based on 139 scans that we have carried out in rats in this and parallel studies, we rarely (24 out of 278 bilateral evaluations; p < 0.0001, Chi-square analysis) detected the obligatory presence of the connectivity between NTS and CVLM in an anterior-posterior presentation of the FA map of the medulla oblongata.

Changes in NTS-RVLM connectivity reflect alterations in functionality of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone under physiological conditions
Our first set of results ascertained that the changes in connectivity between NTS and RVLM genuinely reflect the physiological functionality of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone. As shown in Fig. 3 and quantified in Table 4, an increase in MAP induced by intravenous infusion of NE was accompanied by a temporally correlated decrease in the power density of the BLF component of SBP signals, our experimental index for baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone [15,17] and HR. Concurrent tractographic analysis showed a discernible elevation of the connectivity between NTS and RVLM [Fig. 3] and a significant augmentation of FA [Table 4], the DTI index. Of interest was that the NTS-RVLM connectivity and the power density of the BLF component of SBP signals reversed to pre-infusion levels in a parallel fashion on return of MAP to baseline after termination of NE infusion.Fig. 3 Representative example of concurrent imaging of connectivity (yellow arrows) between the NTS and RVLM by DTI and measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) or power density of the low-frequency component (BLF) of SBP spectrum before, during and after 30 min of intravenous infusion (at red arrow) of norepinephrine (NE; 4 mg kg−1 h−1) to rats. Note in this and Fig. 4, Fig. 5, representative colors for tractography in color-encoded FA maps are: blue, caudal-rostral; red, left-right; and green, dorsal-ventral.

Our second set of results demonstrates the stability of our experimental paradigm. We observed that superimposed on steady MAP, HR and BLF power 30 min before and 60 min after intravenous administration of saline [Fig. 4, Fig. 6] was the simultaneous exhibition of consistent and stable connectivity between the NTS and RVLM manifested either graphically by the robust dorsal-ventral signals [Fig. 4] or quantitatively by FA [Fig. 6].Fig. 4 Representative example of concurrent imaging of connectivity (yellow arrows) between the NTS and RVLM by DTI and measurement of MAP, HR or BLF power 30 min before and 30 or 60 min after intravenous administration of saline (at red arrow) to rats.

Changes in NTS-RVLM connectivity also reflect alterations in functionality of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone under pathophysiological conditions
Our third set of results demonstrates the versatility of our experimental paradigm by showing that changes in connectivity between NTS and RVLM also reflect alterations in pathophysiological functionality of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone. For this part of our study, we took advantage of two fashions of cardiovascular responses to mevinphos at its LD50 dose. On intravenous administration at 960 μg kg−1, 50% of the rats underwent a significant increase in our index for baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and MAP, alongside discernible but insignificant elevation of HR; to be followed by the return of all parameters to the basal level [Fig. 5, Fig. 6]. Concurrent tractographic analysis [Fig. 5A] revealed that the robust NTS-RVLM connectivity before mevinphos administration exhibited an appreciable reduction that was concomitant with the increase in BLF power. Intriguingly, the connectivity between the NTS and RVLM was re-established when the power density of the BLF component of SBP signals returned to basal level. Quantification of the magnitude of NTS-RVLM connectivity by FA yielded comparable results [Fig. 6].

Administration of mevinphos at its LD50 dose also resulted in fatality in half of the rats tested. After a very brief increase, there was an abrupt and significant reduction in the power density of the BLF component of SBP signals, MAP and HR, followed by death of the animals [Fig. 5, Fig. 6]. Intriguingly, even within this short duration of 7–8 min after injection of mevinphos, we noted that the index of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone reached zero [Fig. 5B, blue dashed line] before the exhibition of asystole [Fig. 5B, red dashed line]. Clinically, this signifies brain stem death in comatose patients despite the presence of reasonable SBP and maintained HR [[23], [24], [25]]. Concurrent tractographic analysis of the brain stem again demonstrated that the NTS-RVLM connectivity was severed coincidental with the loss of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone [Fig. 5B]. Again, quantification by FA revealed comparable results [Fig. 6].

To further demonstrate the fidelity of our experimental paradigm, we found that the changes in MAP, HR or the power density of the BLF component of SBP signals in response to intravenous administration of mevinphos recorded concurrently with DTI were comparable to those recorded under the same experimental setting but without MR scanning or those obtained under the conventional laboratory setting using polyethylene tubing and strain-gauge transducer [Table 6].Table 5 Temporal changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) in the pyramidal tracts after intravenous administration of saline or mevinphos (Mev; 960 μg kg−1).

Lack of corresponding DTI changes in pyramidal tract
As a negative control, tractographic analysis of the bilateral pyramidal tracts, which do not play a role in baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone, showed consistent FA values only in the caudal-rostral direction [Table 4, Table 5] in animals that received intravenous infusion of NE, administration of saline or animals that survived or died after mevinphos treatment.

Discussion
This article details the implementation of concurrent tractographic analysis of baroreflex neural circuit and evaluation of baroreflex functionality in the rat. Using NTS-RVLM connectivity and baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone as an illustrative example, in conjunction with baroreflex induction and the mevinphos intoxication model of brain stem death, we further demonstrated that this experimental paradigm exhibits stability, versatility and fidelity, and the results obtained bear physiological and pathophysiological implications.

Physiological implications
As pointed out in a recent review [5], DTI uses water molecules as the probe to offer information on diffusion anisotropy, and tractographic analysis investigates brain connectivity. Since the diffusion of water molecules along the axon in parallel bundles will create prominent anisotropy in the direction of the passage of action potentials, it is reasoned that changes in FA can be taken to infer augmentation, reduction or cessation of impulse traffic between two brain structures, which were termed elevation, disruption or severance of functional connectivity. The capability to observe simultaneous changes in neuronal traffic within the neural circuit of the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone and alterations of its experimental surrogate, the power density of the BLF component of the SBP signals, therefore represents a meaningful advancement in physiological methodology.

The implementation of concurrent tractographic analysis of baroreflex neural circuit and evaluation of baroreflex functionality in the rat bear at least two noteworthy physiological implications. The first implication is that neuronal traffic in the neural circuit in the brain stem indeed takes place during the execution of baroreflex. More intriguingly, the second implication concerns the contemporary neural circuit for baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone, which depicts the CVLM as an intermediate between the NTS and RVLM [1,2]. We rarely detected the obligatory presence of connectivity between NTS and CVLM in an anterior-posterior presentation of the FA map of the medulla oblongata. Nevertheless, commensurate temporal changes in NTS-RVLM connectivity and baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 were consistently demonstrated. In hindsight, our initial attempt to visualize this arm of the baroreflex based on identification of the obligatory NTS-CVLM connectivity has stalled our progress for no less than 9 months. It was only after we resolved that this connection is essentially absent from the neural circuit of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone that we were able to move forward with the development of our experimental paradigm.

Direct projection of barosensitive NTS neurons to the RVLM has been reported in rabbits [26] and rats [3,27], and the possibility exists for those NTS neurons to synapse with GABAergic interneurons in the RVLM [28]. It is therefore conceivable that, similar to mice [9,12], the baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone in rats is also sustained by a tonic inhibitory input from the NTS to RVLM, which in turn lessens the tonic excitatory action of these premotor sympathetic neurons on vasomotor tone. To offer credence to this notion, we demonstrated that the reflex decrease in sympathetic vasomotor tone in response to elevation of MAP induced by the infusion of NE is concomitant with augmentation in the NTS-RVLM connectivity [Fig. 3] indicative of enhanced inhibition of RVLM neurons from the NTS. We further showed that a reduction in FA between NTS and RVLM indicative of disinhibition of RVLM neurons is concurrent with an increase in BLF power during the first 30 min in rats that survived mevinphos [Fig. 5, Fig. 6].

We are cognizant that detection of DTI signals is determined by the threshold set by the algorithm that stitches together adjacent voxels. It is therefore certainly true that one can manipulate the appearance and disappearance of DTI signals by adjusting the threshold conditions. Nevertheless, this is not the case in our experimental design because we employed exactly the same scanning parameters and settings for post-processing of the images in all segments of our study. Based on this design, we demonstrated not just disappearance but also decrease and increase in NTS-RVLM connectivity. More importantly and in physiological terms, we consistently showed that those changes in connectivity between the NTS and RVLM were temporally commensurate with corresponding alterations in baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone.

Clinical implications
Our pathophysiological observations also bear clinical implications. Specifically, it allowed us to conclude that whether an animal will survive or die in our mevinphos intoxication model of brain stem death depends on whether the connectivity between the NTS and RVLM is reversibly disrupted (pathophysiology) or is irreversibly severed (pathology). Defunct baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone has been demonstrated to be causally related to brain stem death in comatose patients [[23], [24], [25]]. The presence of an interim when cardiac functions are sustained after brain death until the invariable asystole that follows is one of the driving forces for recognizing brain stem death as the legal definition of death in Taiwan [29], UK [30], US [31] and EU [32]. Fig. 5B amply demonstrates that this sequence of events begins with the cessation of neuronal traffic between the NTS and RVLM, leading to the loss of baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone that signifies brain death, followed by cardiac death.

Technical considerations
The chief hurdle to implement concurrent analysis of the baroreflex neural circuit using DTI and evaluation of baroreflex functionality is the magnetic fields created by the MR scanner, which dictates that no significant magnetically susceptible objects are allowed in the room that houses the magnet. At the same time, the magnetic fields and radiofrequency energy produced by the super-conducting magnet may cause electrically active devices to malfunction, erase magnetic data media, or destroy mechanically-sensitive components. As a result, the physiological monitors for cardiovascular events must be placed outside the confines of the magnetic field. At the same time, it is essential that the sensors, transducers and connecting cables must be on one hand devoid of ferromagnetic materials, and on the other capable to record and transmit BP signals with fidelity. After numerous trials-and-errors, we finally surmounted these difficulties by employing a fiber-optic ultra-miniature sensor to measure BP signals from the femoral artery, and transmitting these signals to an Optical Pressure Control Unit placed outside the confines of the magnetic field via a fiberglass wire. In addition to stability, we demonstrated the fidelity of this recording system by showing that the MAP, HR and baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone determinations were not affected by the magnetic fields during MR scanning, and were comparable to those recorded in a conventional manner based on cannulation of the femoral artery with polyethylene tubing and strain-gauge transducer.

As discussed recently [5,9], in addition to the size, the location of the brain stem in an oblique position from the horizontal plane of the cortical surface and beneath the cerebellum makes its accessibility by MRI difficult. To apply an angled restraining device to the head of the animal to produce an angle between the brain stem/cervical spinal cord and the rest of the body, as suggested for mice [33], is an option. Since we reasoned that this unnatural position would exert extra stress on the rat, we have resorted to placing the cortex in its horizontal position but using a higher magnetic strength (9.4T) to improve signal detection. Together with systematic optimization of the scanning parameters, we were able to obtain high quality T2-weighted sagittal anatomical reference images of the brain, coronal anatomical images of the medulla oblongata, and DTI images of the connectivity between key components of the baroreflex neural circuits. It should be stressed that, for practical reasons, the scanning parameters in a clinical setting for DTI are by-and-large fixed. On the other hand, for MR scanning in animals, the parameters require fine tuning to obtain optimal results. The scanning parameters reported in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3 should therefore be taken as an initial guide for easy implementation of new parameters that befit individual requirements.

Limitations
Despite the technical advancements and the physiological or clinical implications, we recognize that at least two limitations of the reported methods still remain. The first limitation is with the time-window of our evaluations. To obtain optimal results for our DTI analysis, an acquisition time of approximately 30 min was required. By definition, the concomitantly obtained MAP, HR and baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone represent the 30 min average of those cardiovascular responses. We are currently working on shortening this time-window while retaining the quality of our tractographic analysis. Until this goal is realized, the reported method is more suitable for studies that are not designed to measure beat-to-beat cardiovascular events. The second limitation is with the duration of our evaluations. It is obvious that the advantage of synchronized tractographic analysis of baroreflex neural circuits and physiological evaluation of baroreflex functionality will be maximized should the same experimental paradigm be repeated on the same animal over days or perhaps weeks. Unfortunately, the rigidity and fragility of the fiber-optic sensor and the fiberglass connecting cable prevented us from carrying out our experimental paradigm on a repetitive basis. One potential solution is to instrument the rats for radiotelemetric measurements of cardiovascular events. Although MRI-compatible implants for radiotelemetry in rats have been reported [34], its applicability in synchronized DTI analysis and cardiovascular evaluation remains to be established.

Concluding remarks
Using baroreflex-mediated sympathetic vasomotor tone as an example, we report here the implementation of methods that allow for concurrent visualization of neuronal traffic within its neural circuit during the functional execution of baroreflex. In addition to demonstrating its stability, versatility and fidelity, we showed that our experimental paradigm bears physiological and clinical implications. As such, our results substantiate the notion that superimposed on the traditional morphological or pathological evaluations, tractographic analysis offers a hitherto unexplored research dimension as an effective investigative tool for functional evaluations of brain stem activities. On further refinement aiming at resolving its limitations, we envisage that our reported experimental paradigm will open a new vista that allows us to re-examine existing dogmas and create new views on cardiovascular physiology.
