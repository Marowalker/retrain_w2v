oxide synthase) were much greater in cerebellum than in hippocampus. This is the first evidence of

INTRODUCTION
Protein nitration is a post-translational modification that is induced by RNS (reactive nitrogen
species) such as peroxynitrite (ONOO−) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
ONOO− is produced by the very fast reaction between NO and superoxide radical
in vivo. NO2 is formed by the reaction between
H2O2 and nitrite, which is catalysed with myeloperoxidase and also by
decomposition of ONOO−. These RNS are known to have the potential to cause
oxidation or nitration of various biomolecules. One of the modifications by RNS is the nitration of
tyrosine residues in proteins [1–3]. It has been reported that nitrotyrosine-containing proteins were observed in
neurons of AD (Alzheimer's disease) [4,5], Lewy bodies of Parkinson's disease [6] and
aged rat cerebellum [7]. Therefore nitrotyrosine has been used
as a marker of oxidative and nitrative stress in brain. On the other hand, nitrotyrosine-containing
proteins were detected endogenously in the brain of adult mice (9 weeks old) by using
proteomic analysis [8]. Moreover, it has been shown that
protein tyrosine nitration may regulate cell differentiation [9] and control microtubule dynamics [10]. Thus,
protein tyrosine nitration also occurs under physiological conditions in vivo.

We have found another type of protein nitration as a novel post-translational modification,
namely, formation of NO2Trp (nitrotryptophan) in proteins. Although several types of
nitrated tryptophan, such as 5- and 6-NO2Trp, have been detected through in
vitro and in vivo studies [11,12], we have demonstrated that 6-NO2Trp is the major
nitrated products [12,13]. Previously, Ishii et al. [14] demonstrated the
presence of 27–33 nmol of 6-NO2Trp per mol of tryptophan in protease-digested
liver of mice after acetaminophen administration by using a quantitative method with LC-ESI-MS/MS
(LC-electrospray ionization-tandem MS). Therefore we have developed monoclonal and polyclonal
anti-6-NO2Trp-specific antibodies and constructed a method to detect 6-NO2Trp
residue-containing proteins in ONOO− modified PC12 cells or their cell lysates by
using these antibodies and LC-ESI-MS/MS analyses [15,16]. We identified several glycolytic enzymes and functional
proteins as 6-NO2Trp residue-containing proteins and determined the positions of
6-NO2Trp in the amino acid sequences [16]. In
addition, we found changes of 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins in the differentiation process
from PC12 cells to neuron-like cells induced by NGF (nerve growth factor). We also successfully
identified several specific sites of nitrated tryptophan in these proteins [17]. These findings raise the possibility that 6-NO2Trp-containing
proteins could be detected in physiological conditions in vivo. We have chosen rat
cerebellum and hippocampus as targets for the formation of 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins
in physiological processes. Cerebellum contains all three isoforms of NOS (nitric oxide synthase)
and the highest levels of nNOS (neuronal NOS), which generate NO as a component of
ONOO−, compared with other brain regions [18]. Hippocampus CA1 and cerebellar granule cells are known to be more sensitive to
oxidative stress than other brain regions under basal conditions [19].

In the present study, we found 12 NO2Trp-containing proteins from hippocampus and
seven proteins from cerebellum and determined the positions of the nitrated tryptophan residues in
these amino acid sequences. We also observed that the total amount of 6-NO2Trp-containing
proteins in the cerebellum was significantly greater than that in hippocampus
(P<0.05). Moreover, we suggested that an increase in nitration rate of the
proteins might contribute to the abundance of 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins in cerebellum,
at least partially, by focusing on aldolase C as a typical example. This is the first evidence of
several specific sites of nitrated tryptophan in proteins under physiological conditions in
vivo.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
The institutional ethics review committee of Juntendo University approved all experimental
protocols. Adult male Fischer 344/N rats (6 months of age, n=5) were obtained from
Japan SLC Inc. The rats were housed under a 12 h light/12 h dark in an environmentally
controlled room (23±1°C room temperature, 55±5% relative humidity) and were
provided with food and water ad libitum.

Sample preparation
The rats were deeply anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and their brains were removed.
Hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected from the brain and frozen in isopentane cooled to
approximately −80°C. The frozen hippocampus and cerebellum were stored at
−80°C until use. The frozen hippocampus and cerebellum were homogenized in a lysis
buffer containing 40 mM Tris/HCl, 8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mM DTT
(dithiothreitol), 1 mM EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). The homogenates were
then centrifuged at 15000 g for 15 min, and the middle
layer, containing the proteins, was carefully withdrawn. Protein concentrations were determined by
the Bradford method (Protein assay kit; Bio-Rad).

Two-dimensional electrophoresis and SDS/PAGE
Three samples from each hippocampus and cerebellum were used for proteomic analysis. A portion
[200 μg (Western blotting) and 300 μg (Sypro Ruby staining)] of protein
was dissolved in the rehydration buffer containing 8 M urea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mM DTT, 0.5%
IPG (immobilized pH gradient) buffer and Bromophenol Blue. Then, this solution was applied to an IPG
strip (Immobiline™ DryStrip pH 3–10 NL, 7 cm; GE Healthcare) and the IPG
strip was rehydrated for at least 10 h at 20°C. Next, IEF (isoelectric focusing) was
performed at 20°C on an Ettan IPGphor 3 apparatus (GE Healthcare) using a protocol provided
by the supplier. After IEF, IPG strips were equilibrated for 15 min in a solution containing
50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 6.8), 6 M urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% DTT and Bromophenol
Blue. Two-dimensional SDS/PAGE was carried out using 10% polyacrylamide gels. Subsequently, Western
blotting and Sypro Ruby staining were performed. For semi-quantitative analyses of the proteins and
enzymes, SDS/PAGE and Western blotting were carried out.

Western blot analysis
After two-dimensional electrophoresis and standard SDS/PAGE, proteins in gels were transferred on
to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, 0.45 μm; Millipore). Non-specific binding sites were
blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Block Ace (DS Pharma Biomedical) and an additional
1 h with non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20),
pH 7.6. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies followed
by 1 h incubation at room temperature with ALP (alkaline phosphatase)-conjugated secondary
antibodies. The signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using Immunstar-AP substrate (Bio-Rad).
The primary antibodies used in the present study were as follows: rabbit and mouse
anti-6-NO2Trp antibody developed in our laboratory [15], mouse anti-nNOS, eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase), iNOS (inducible NOS)
antibodies (BD Biosciences), goat anti-aldolase C antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse
anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma–Aldrich). The secondary antibodies used in the present
study were as follows: ALP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG Fc-specific (1:50000, Sigma–Aldrich),
ALP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Fc-specific (1:50000, Thermo Scientific–Pierce),
ALP-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:50000, Millipore Chemicon). For the control experiment for the
specificity of the anti-6-NO2Trp antibodies, we used a modified method, which was
originally reported in a previous study [20] to reduce
nitrated proteins. After the transfer, the membranes were exposed to a boiled 0.1 M PBS
(pH 7.2) containing 10 mM DTT and 25 μM bovine Hb (haemoglobin) (Sigma)
or boiled 0.1 M PBS without both DTT and Hb for 3 min. Then, the membranes were washed
with TBST, non-specific binding was blocked, and Western blotting was performed. Band densities were
determined using Image J software.

Nano ESI-MS/MS
Sypro Ruby-stained gel spots, which were observed as anti-6-NO2Trp-positive signals in
the Western blotting, were cut and digested with trypsin. The tryptic peptides were subjected to
LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis using a Thermo Fisher Scientific LXQ mass spectrometer with nano-LC (AMR). The
LXQ mass spectrometer system consists of a nano-ESI apparatus and an ion trap mass spectrometer.
Samples were introduced into the mass spectrometer at 500 nl/min. Typical ESI conditions were as
follows: ion spray voltage 1.8 kV, heated capillary temperature 200°C, capillary voltage
40 V and tube lens 115 V. Collision-induced dissociation-MS/MS experiments were
performed on mass-selected precursor ions using standard isolation and excitation procedures
(activation q value 0.25, activation time 30 ms). The collision energy used was 35 (arbitrary
units). The conditions of nano-LC were as follows: Magic C18 column (0.2 mm
internal diameter×150 mm) and elution with 0.1% formic acid in 2% CH3CN
(solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in 90% CH3CN (solvent B) using a programme of 5% solvent
B for 10 min equilibration and a gradient at 2% solvent B/min for 30 min with a flow
rate of 500 nl/min. A database search of Swiss-Prot was performed using the MASCOT search
engine (Matrix Science). For identification of 6-NO2Trp residues, a modification of 44.99
Da was applied on each of the tryptophan residues. In addition, the following modifications were
accounted for during the search: oxidation of Met (+16 Da), methylation of His (+14 Da) and
formylation of lysine residue (+28 Da).

IP (immunoprecipitation)
For IP, 60 μl of Protein G–Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (GE Healthcare) was
washed with IP buffer containing 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
100 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 and Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). The beads were
suspended in l ml of IP buffer containing 500 μg of protein from the homogenates of
hippocampus or cerebellum and rotated at 4°C for 1 h to remove proteins which are
non-specifically bound to the beads. After rotation, the beads were centrifuged and the supernatants
were placed in new microcentrifuge tubes. Subsequently, new beads and 2 μg of goat
anti-aldolase C antibody were added to the tubes, and rotated overnight at 4°C. The
protein-bound beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with IP buffer. The
bound proteins were solubilized with sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 2 h.
After incubation, the protein samples were loaded on to 10% polyacrylamide gels. Then, Western
blotting using mouse anti-6-NO2Trp and goat anti-aldolase C antibodies was performed.

Statistical analysis
Results are presented as means±S.D. A paired Student's t test was used to
analyse the differences between hippocampus and cerebellum. Statistical significance was set at
P<0.05.

RESULTS
Western blotting with the 6-NO2Trp antibody
Figure 1 shows representative results of Western blotting
with the anti-6-NO2Trp antibody (Figures 1A and
1B) and Sypro Ruby staining gels (Figures 1C and 1D) after two-dimensional PAGE of
hippocampus (Figures 1A and 1C) and cerebellum (Figures 1B and 1D). Many immunoreactive spots of anti-6-NO2Trp antibody were observed in
both of the brain regions from the 6-month-old adult rats. Although several immunoreactive spots
were detected only in hippocampus or cerebellum, most of the immunoreactive spots were observed in
both. In the control experiment, NO2Trp was reduced (Figures 2C and 2D) by the method described in the text.
The results of the same treatment without reducing agents are shown in Figures 2(A) and 2(B). The immunoreactive spots of
rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-6-NO2Trp antibody became weak and several
spots disappeared by the reduction. Although complete disappearance of the spots had not been
attained by this treatment, it has been reported that reduction can be problematic and sometimes may
not fully reduce all of the nitrated protein present [21].
Therefore these results indicate the specificity of both anti-6-NO2Trp antibodies is
considerably high.

circled spots and spots indicated by arrows in hippocampus (h1–h16) and cerebellum

Figure 2 Representative non-reduced and reduced membranes
The samples in the membranes were treated without reducing agents (A and

text. Immunoreactive spots in (A) and (C) are detected using rabbit
polyclonal anti-6-NO2Trp antibody. Immunoreactive spots in (B) and
(D) are detected using mouse monoclonal anti-6-NO2Trp antibody.

LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of 6-NO2Trp-antibody positive spots
A total of 16 immunoreactive spots and 15 spots on the membrane for the samples from hippocampus
and cerebellum respectively were cut out from Sypro Ruby-stained gels and digested with trypsin. The
digested samples were analysed with LC-ESI-MS/MS. Putative 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins
from both regions are shown in Table 1. Although four
proteins including mitochondrial electron transfer flavoprotein subunit α and creatine
kinases were identified only in hippocampus and three proteins including voltage-dependent
anion-selective channel protein 1 were identified only in cerebellum as putative
6-NO2Trp-containing proteins (Table 1), most of
the other spots included the same 12 proteins, such as α-enolase, tubulins and
fructose-bisphosphate aldolases (Table 1). We successfully
determined the positions of the nitrated tryptophan residues in amino acid sequences of 12 proteins
from hippocampus (Table 2) and seven proteins from cerebellum
(Table 3). These proteins in both regions included
cytoskeletal proteins and glycolytic enzymes. Figure 3 shows
the MS/MS spectrum of fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C as a typical example of the MS/MS
analyses.

Semi-quantitative studies of 6-NO2Trp-containing enzyme and NOS by Western
blotting
In order to compare gross amounts of 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins in hippocampus and
cerebellum quantitatively, we measured total intensity of the bands on the membrane by Western blot
analysis using β-actin as a loading control. Figure 4(A)
shows the difference in 6-NO2Trp-containing protein bands between hippocampus and
cerebellum. The total intensity of 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins in the cerebellum was
significantly greater than that in hippocampus (P<0.01, Figure 4B). We observed the appearance of several new bands and the increased
intensity of several bands for the cerebellum (Figure 4A). In
order to clarify whether there is a protein with a higher rate of nitration in the cerebellum, we
chose spots c9 and h9, which have been identified as aldolase C, as a target protein (Table 1), as the intensity of spot c9 in the Western
blotting of two-dimensional electrophoresis was also clearly higher than that of h9 (Figures 1A and 1B). We isolated
aldolase C by IP using anti-aldolase C antibody from the extracts of cerebellum and hippocampus and
applied the isolated samples to SDS/PAGE and Western blotting. The relative intensity of
immunostaining for 6-NO2Trp over aldolase C was much higher in cerebellum than in
hippocampus (Figure 5). Therefore the increase in the nitration
rate of the proteins, as shown in aldolase C, contribute, at least in part, to the increase in gross
amounts of 6-NO2Trp-containing proteins shown in Figure
4.

significantly larger in cerebellum than in hippocampus. We did not observe any difference in protein
expression of iNOS between these regions.

DISCUSSION
We have found nitration of tryptophan residues in cultured cells of a model for neuronal
differentiation (PC12 cells) and suggested that tryptophan nitration may play a role in the
cell-differentiation process in a previous study [17]. In the
present study, we focused on rat brain as a target for in vivo study. This is the
first study to identify several specific sites of nitrated tryptophan on proteins in
vivo in a physiological state (Tables 2 and 3). Ishii et al. [14]
reported the presence of 4- and 6-NO2Trp in the protease-digested liver homogenate from
mice after administration of acetaminophen by using the LC-ESI-MS/MS method. They found
2.24–3.92 and 26.96–32.71 nmol/mol tryptophan for 4- and 6-NO2Trp
respectively in the homogenate [14]. This evidence supports
in vivo formation of NO2Trp, although it is from the oxidative stress
conditions. On the other hand, formation of 5-hydroxy-6-NO2Trp by SCOT (succinyl-CoA
3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase) has been reported in the heart [22] and kidney [23] of rats. We also found several
peptides having an increase in mass of 61 (molecular mass corresponding to +NO2-H+OH-H),
which may correspond to the formation of 5-hydroxy-6-NO2Trp, with a significant ion score
in our system in the present study (results not shown). However, Wang et al. [24] did not find formation of 5-hydroxy-6-NO2Trp but found only
nitrotyrosine in SCOT from a diabetic model mouse. Therefore formation of
5-hydroxy-6-NO2Trp might depend on the biological conditions.

We have shown that the nitration of single tryptophan at position 32 in human recombinant
Cu, Zn-SOD (copper/zinc superoxide dismutase) decreases the enzymatic activity [13,25] and the nitration of
three tryptophan residues in egg-white lysozyme resulted in total loss of the activity in our
previous study [26]. These observations indicate that the
nitration of tryptophan residues in enzymes could affect the activity of enzymes. We have
investigated the position of the modified tryptophan residues in the three-dimensional structure of
the identified proteins in the present study. We found that five of the modified tryptophan residues
are located near substrates or coenzyme-binding sites of the enzymes, namely, Trp616 and
Trp483 in PDCE2 [dihydrolipoly(lysine)-residue acetyltransferase component of PDH
(pyruvate dehydrogenase) complex] in mitochondria, Trp314 in fructose-bisphosphate
aldolase C (Supplementary Figure S1 at http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/032/bsr0320521add.htm), Trp85 and
Trp311 in GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (Supplementary Figure S2 at
http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/032/bsr0320521add.htm) and Trp383 in
phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Supplementary Figure S3 at http://www.bioscirep.org/bsr/032/bsr0320521add.htm). We show the three-dimensional
structure of human PDCE2 in Figure 7 as a typical
example. The amino acid sequences of PDCE2 are 93% identical between human and rat. The positions of
the nitrated tryptophan residues are shown in black in Figure
7. Trp616 and Trp483 are located within the CoA-binding region. The
addition of a nitro group to these tryptophan residues may cause steric hindrance and a different
state on the indole π electron, consequently these changes may affect CoA binding and
modulate the activity of the enzyme. However, further studies using isolated proteins are required
to clarify the effects of the nitration of the tryptophan residues for each of the enzymes.

The results for three-dimensioanl modelling were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. The
accession number of the protein is 3B8K. Both Trp616 and Trp483 (shown in
yellow), which were nitrated in the present study are located within the CoA-binding region and near
the catalytic amino acid residues (shown in blue).

We observed a very similar pattern of immunoreactive spots between hippocampus and cerebellum
(Figure 1). However, there were fewer identified peptide
sequences with nitrated tryptophan in cerebellum (Table 3)
than in hippocampus (Table 2). This may be attributable to
the difference in relative contents of each protein in the total protein between cerebellum and
hippocampus. On the other hand, the relative amount of NO2Trp-containing proteins in
cerebellum was higher than that of hippocampus upon analysis using SDS/PAGE (Figure 4). This apparent discrepancy can be explained in part by the evidence that
proteins with a large molecular mass or extremely low or high pI are not taken into isoelectric gels
in two-dimensional electrophoresis [27]. Therefore the amount
of unloaded NO2Trp-containing proteins may be larger in cerebellum than in hippocampus.
We showed that the nitration rate of tryptophan residues in aldolase C in cerebellum was
significantly higher than that in hippocampus (Figure 5). This
evidence may result in an increased degree of nitration of each of the tryptophan residues in
aldolase C or in an increased percentage of nitrated-tryptophan residues in aldolase C. Therefore
the larger nitration amount of the proteins in cerebellum is attributed to the larger modification
rate of the proteins at least partly. This higher level of nitration of the proteins could be
attributable to the increased concentration of RNS in cerebellum. In rat brain, the enzyme activity
and expression of nNOS in cerebellum are higher than those in hippocampus [28,29]. In the present study, we have
confirmed that cerebellum contains significantly larger amounts of nNOS and eNOS than hippocampus.
Thus the expression levels of nNOS and eNOS may affect the difference of NO2Trp content
between hippocampus and cerebellum. In other words, the expression level of NOS may regulate the
nitration of tryptophan residues as a post-translational modification. In normal rat brain, using
light and electron microscopy, nitroty-rosine immunoreactivity was shown to be higher in brain
regions enriched in nNOS-containing neurons and/or near the neurons, indicating that the expression
level of nNOS affects protein nitration [30]. This
observation supports the above-mentioned hypothesis.

Finally, we describe the possible significance of the endogenous formation of 6-NO2Trp
in cerebellum and hippocampus. Formation of 3-nitrotyrosine in proteins by RNS has been widely
reported in a number of pathological states associated with inflammation [1–3]. We have identified several
proteins that contain nitrated tryptophan from affected areas of a model mouse of an inflammatory
disease (H. Kawasaki, M. Tominaga, K. Takamori, H. Ogawa, A. Shigenaga and F. Yamakura, unpublished
results). This model mouse is known to have oxidative stress in the affected areas. Therefore
nitration of tryptophan residues may be caused widely under oxidative stress conditions in
vivo, which is the same as the case of nitrotyrosine formation. Previously, Sacksteder et
al. [8] found 31 unique nitrotyrosine sites within 29
different proteins in a whole mouse brain under basal conditions using LC/LC-MS/MS analyses. They
pointed out that more than half of the tyrosine-nitrated proteins are involved in Parkinson's
disease or AD. Therefore they suggested that these endogenously nitrated proteins have tyrosine
residues specifically sensitive to nitration under mild conditions of oxidative and nitrative stress
as a possible concept. Similar to this situation, the first significance for the endogenous
formation of NO2Trp could be at sites sensitive to mild oxidative and nitrative stress.
Three of the NO2Trp-containing enzymes that we identified in the present study (creatine
kinase, actin and tubulin β) are related to AD and Parkinson's diseases [8]. Although we used adult rats (6 months old), not aged rats, they
could have a low level of oxidative/nitrative stress in brain under normal conditions. Since NOS
levels are much higher in cerebellum than in hippocampus (Figure
6), these stresses may be higher in cerebellum (Figure
4). Nitrotyptophan could be used as a sensitive marker to detect mild oxidative/nitrative
stress in vivo.

The additional significance of endogenous NO2Trp formation is that it could have some
physiological functions. The formation of nitrotyrosine has been proposed not only as a marker of
oxidative/nitrative damage but also as a functionally relevant post-translational modification of
proteins under normal physiological conditions [31]. Three
major effects on protein function, that is, no change in protein function, loss of function and gain
of function, due to tyrosine nitration can be envisaged. We have found changes in the nitration of
tryptophan residues in several proteins during the differentiation process from PC12 cells to
neuron-like cells and proposed that tryptophan nitration may contribute somewhat to the
differentiation process in the cells [17]. Since we have only
limited information on the effect of tryptophan nitration on enzyme function, that is, reducing or
abolishing the activity of the isolated enzyme [13,25], we could not clarify the mechanism of the functional change of
the enzymes by tryptophan nitration. However, many tryptophan residues in enzymes are known to have
specific function in the proteins. For instance, carbohydrates are known to bind preferentially to
tryptophan residues in proteins [32] and tryptophan residues
exhibit important roles for the binding to lipid bilayer membrane in some enzymes [33]. Nitration of the tryptophan residues may change the
interaction of the enzymes with those components. Although further studies are required to clarify
the mechanism in detail, the participation of tryptophan nitration in some physiological processes
of cerebellum and hippocampus could be of significance. As the nitration of tryptophan residues
affects enzyme functions by mechanisms different from the nitration of tyrosine residues, studies on
the tyrosine nitration alone are insufficient to understand whole RNS functions in physiological
processes. Therefore tryptophan nitration is a very important and unique target to be
elucidated.

In conclusion, we were able to identify NO2Trp-containing cytoskeletal proteins and
glycolytic enzymes in both hippocampus and cerebellum. This is the first proteomic study to identify
several NO2Trp-containing proteins in physiological conditions in vivo.
Furthermore, we showed that there is a difference in the amounts of NO2Trp-containing
proteins between hippocampus and cerebellum, and this difference may result in the difference in the
nitration rate of tryptophan residues in the proteins from both regions and the difference in the
formation NO in physiological states. These findings suggest the possibility of regulating the
function of proteins by the nitration of tryptophan residues in the proteins in
vivo together with the possibility of a biomarker for oxidative and nitrative stress.
