increased osteoclast activity, can lead to alveolar bone destruction and
implantation failure. miRNAs participate in the regulation of various
inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis and osteoporosis. Therefore, the
present study aimed to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in
canine peri-implantitis and to explore the functions of their target genes. An
miRNA sequence analysis was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in
peri-implantitis. Under the criteria of a fold-change >1.5 and
P<0.01, 8 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated miRNAs
were selected for predictions of target genes and their biological functions.
Based on the results of Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, these
miRNAs may fine-tune the inflammatory process in peri-implantitis through an
intricate mechanism. The results of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
revealed that let-7g, miR-27a, and miR-145 may
play important roles in peri-implantitis and are worth further investigation.
The results of the present study provide insights into the potential biological
effects of the differentially expressed miRNAs, and specific enrichment of
target genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway was observed. These findings highlight the intricate and specific roles
of miRNAs in inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, both of which are key aspects
of peri-implantitis, and thus may contribute to future investigations of the
etiology, underlying mechanism, and treatment of peri-implantitis.

Introduction
Over the past decade, implant therapy has been widely accepted and chosen as a
routine procedure for the reconstruction of fully or partially edentulous
individuals. However, peri-implantitis has been shown to affect long-term success
following the osseointegration process and the stability of the established implants
[1].

Peri-implantitis is defined as an inflammatory response surrounding implants and is
characterized by an infection of the soft tissue and loss of the surrounding bone
[2]. The host immune defense against
bacterial challenge is responsible for the peri-implant tissue damage [3]. Lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils
are recruited and activated by the immune system and induce a local inflammatory
response in the soft and bone tissues by producing cytokines and chemokines [4]. In particular, proinflammatory cytokines
(e.g. TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, and receptor
activator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)),
anti-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-4 and IL-10) and chemokines (e.g. IL-8,
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1α)
have been suggested to be important mediators of inflammation and immunity during
the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis [5–9]. Additionally, this
local immune-inflammatory process is associated with disrupted bone remodeling.
Osteoclastogenesis induction appears to be a major determinant of the uncoupling of
bone resorption and bone formation, resulting in loss of the supporting alveolar
bone and, subsequently, implant failure [10].

miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that are approximately 18–22 nts
long. These single-stranded molecules regulate gene expression by binding to the
complementary sequences in the 3′-untranslated or coding region of the target
mRNAs, leading to either blockade of translation or induction of target mRNA
degradation [11,12]. Therefore, miRNAs participate in not only physiological
processes within cells and tissues but also pathological processes. According to
previous reports, miRNAs are specifically involved in many inflammatory and
bone-related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, and periodontitis
[13–15]. Several studies [15–17] have compared the
miRNA profiles of patients with periodontitis with healthy patients, but no reports
related to the miRNA profiles of patients with peri-implantitis have been published.
Although the two diseases share many features, the results for periodontitis are not
necessarily applicable to peri-implantitis. In fact, based on emerging evidence,
peri-implantitis and periodontitis exhibit several key differences, including their
histopathological and molecular characteristics [4,18]. Considering the
aforementioned analysis, inflammatory miRNAs may be differentially expressed in
peri-implantitis tissue compared with healthy gingival tissue.

Therefore, in the present study, we used miRNA sequencing to identify differentially
expressed miRNAs in canine experimental peri-implantitis and validated the results
using real-time PCR. Additionally, we ultimately determined the roles of the miRNAs
in this inflammatory process by analyzing the functions of their target genes and
identifying the involved pathways.

Methods
Animals
Six healthy adult male Labrador dogs aged 18–24 months with an approximate
weight of 25 kg were used in the study. All animals were obtained from the Ninth
People’s Hospital Animal Center (Shanghai, China). During the
experiments, the six dogs were housed separately in kennels with 100%
fresh air, an ambient temperature of 25 ± 0.1°C and humidity of
40–70%. They were fed a soft diet once daily and given free access
to fresh water. All experiments in the present study were performed in
accordance with an ethical permit approved by the Animal Care and Experiment
Committee of the Ninth People’s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong
University School of Medicine, China.

Experimental peri-implantitis
The experimental design is presented in Figure
1A. First, the bilateral mandibular fourth premolar and first molar
(P4-M1) were extracted from the six dogs. Three months later, 24 (2 per side for
each dog) standard ITI implants (Straumann AG, Waldenburg, Switzerland) were
inserted by one experienced operator, according to the manufacturer’s
recommended protocols. All implants were transmucosal and healing caps were
placed. Afterward, tissue flaps were restored, and soft tissues were sutured
around each implant using resorbable sutures. All surgeries were performed under
general anesthesia with ketamine (10 mg/kg).

Buprenorphine HCl was administered post-operatively to all animals to relieve any
pain or discomfort, and amoxicillin was used to prevent infection. The animals
were allowed to move freely, were fed a soft diet, and were routinely monitored
for swelling, dehiscence, and infection. Before ligature placement, plaque
control was performed twice weekly using chlorhexidine and gauze.

Three months following implant insertion, peri-implantitis was induced by placing
cotton floss ligatures around the implant neck, as previously described [19]. Ligatures must be closely monitored to
avoid position shifts or loss. In addition, oral hygiene care was stopped after
ligature insertion. The ligatures were then withdrawn 2 months after placement
(Figure 1B).

Radiographic measurements (Figure 1C) and
clinical examinations (Figure 1D) were
performed before ligature placement and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after inflammation
induction to evaluate the successful establishment of the animal model. The
clinical parameters examined included the clinical attachment level (CAL),
gingival index (GI), and bleeding index (BI). Data were recorded from the
buccal, medial, distal, and lingual sides of each implant.

Sample collection and RNA isolation
In the present study, gingival tissues were collected from both healthy and
peri-implantitis sites in all the animal subjects and were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA
concentration and purity were determined by measuring the A260/A280 ratios using
the NanoDrop ND-1000 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.). RNA
samples were immediately frozen and stored at −80°C prior to
use.

Analysis of miRNA sequences
The total RNA from each sample was used to prepare an miRNA sequencing library
for that sample. This preparation process included the following steps: (i)
3′ adaptor ligation, (ii) 5′ adaptor ligation, (iii) cDNA
synthesis, (iv) PCR amplification, and (v) the size-specific selection of
approximately 150-bp PCR amplicons (corresponding to approximately 22-nt
miRNAs). Next, the quality of each sequencing library was assessed using an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., Wilmington, DE, U.S.A.) and
the Agilent DNA 1000 chip kit (Agilent, part # 5067-1504). The libraries were
adjusted to 10 nM before cluster generation. The samples were then denatured
into ssDNA molecules, captured on Illumina flow cells, amplified in
situ as clusters and finally sequenced for 36 cycles on an Illumina
HiSeq sequencer (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Single-end reads (raw reads) were harvested from the Illumina HiSeq sequencer
after quality filtering. The adaptor sequences were trimmed using cutadapt
software, resulting in adaptor-trimmed reads (≥15 nts). Next, the trimmed
reads from all the samples were pooled and miRDeep2 software was used to predict
novel miRNAs. The trimmed reads were aligned to merged pre-miRNA databases
(known pre-miRNAs from miRBase plus the newly predicted pre-miRNAs) using
NovoAlign software (v2.07.11), with at the most one mismatch. The number of
mature miRNA-mapped tags was defined as the raw expression levels of a
particular miRNA. The read counts were normalized using the tags per million
approach (TPM; namely, the tag counts per million aligned miRNAs). All miRNAs
with a fold-change in expression ≥1.5 or ≤ −1.5 and a
P-value ≤0.05 were considered differentially
expressed.

Validation of sequencing results by quantitative real-time PCR
The expression levels of selected miRNAs were confirmed by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR). Briefly, the purified total RNA was reverse transcribed into
cDNAs using the TaqMan MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit and small RNA-specific
RT primers. The reactions were then incubated at 16°C for 30 min,
42°C for 30 min, and 85°C for 5 min and chilled on ice for 5 min,
after which the cDNA was stored at −20°C. The qRT-PCR was
performed in 20 µl reaction mixtures using the TaqMan Small RNA Assay
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, U.S.A.), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. U6 was used as an endogenous control to normalize the
Ct values obtained for each gene. The relative
expression of a miRNA compared with U6 was calculated using the
2−ΔΔCt
method.

Target prediction and functional analysis
The targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using two
different target prediction tools: TargetScan (http://www.targetscan.org/) and miRanda (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do). The intersection of
the two datasets was assayed based on the predicted results. To determine the
potential biological functions and pathways, the top 100 targets of all
differentially expressed miRNAs were further determined and subjected to Gene
Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org/) and KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) pathway analyses. The target
function analysis mainly focussed on biological functions, namely, the
classification of ‘Biological Processes’. Fisher’s exact
test was used to calculate P-values. The false discovery rate
(FDR) was calculated to correct the P-values using the
Benjamini–Hochberg approach.

Statistical analysis
Numerical data are presented as means ± S.D. The difference between means
was analyzed with one-way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant when
P<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed with
the software SPSS19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.).

Results
Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in canine
peri-implantitis
To investigate miRNA expression in peri-implantitis, we performed miRNA
sequencing using gingival tissues obtained from a canine peri-implantitis model.
Based on the criteria described above (P<0.01 and a
fold-change in expression ≥1.5 or ≤ −1.5), a total of 38
miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed (Table 1). Of these miRNAs, 8 were overexpressed in the
diseased tissue compared with healthy tissue, and 30 were underexpressed.

According to several previous reports, most of the low-abundance miRNAs function
in inflammatory processes, including bone resorption (miR-26a, miR-27a,
miR-101, and miR-20a), periodontal ligament
development and mineralization (miR-101), inflammatory cytokine
secretion (miR-27a, miR-93, miR-451, let-7c, miR-146a, and
miR-20a) and endothelial dysfunction (let-7g). However, as
mentioned above, although the absolute number of significantly differentially
expressed low-abundance miRNAs was high, certain miRNAs were expressed at
increased levels in peri-implantitis. Interestingly, nearly all the
high-abundance miRNAs are known to be strongly associated with processes related
to the inflammatory response and bone metabolism, such as osteoclast activity
(miR-142, miR-145, miR-375, and let-7e),
inflammation-related signaling (miR-98), apoptosis
(miR-142), tissue fibrogenesis (miR-142),
and the regulation of endothelial cells (let-7e). Thus, the differentially
expressed miRNAs may be associated with the pathology of peri-implantitis.

Confirmation of differentially expressed miRNAs by qRT-PCR
To confirm the findings obtained by analyzing the miRNA profile, we selected five
miRNAs (let-7g, miR-27a, miR-29a, miR-142, and
miR-145) and measured their expression using qRT-PCR (Figure 2). The chosen miRNAs were broadly
conserved and related to inflammation and included both miRNAs with relatively
increased expression and miRNAs with decreased expression, as reflected by the
fold-change in expression. With the exception of miR-142, the
results for all miRNAs examined using the quantitative assay were consistent
with the data obtained from the miRNA sequence analysis, further confirming that
these miRNAs may participate in peri-implant infection and validating the
accuracy of the sequencing approach. Amongst the four miRNAs, let-7g,
miR-27a, and miR-145 were significantly
differentially expressed between inflamed tissues and healthy control tissues
(P<0.05).

Fold-changes in the expression of three down-regulated miRNAs (let-7g,
miR-27a, and miR-29a) and two
up-regulated miRNAs (miR-142 and
miR-145) were verified. *, statistically
significant difference between the peri-implantitis and control groups,
P<0.05.

Target prediction and functional annotations
In general, only a fraction of predicted targets have been confirmed to be
regulated by a given miRNA in a specific tissue [20]. Therefore, only the top 100 target genes (results not shown)
from overlapping results obtained using two well-established prediction tools,
TargetScan and miRanda, amongst all differentially expressed miRNAs were
retained and considered for further functional annotation analysis to increase
the likelihood of predicting genuine miRNA targets.

To clearly interpret the role of the miRNAs in changes in disease development in
either direction, we next performed GO and KEGG analyses for up-regulated genes
(targets of the low-abundance miRNAs) and down-regulated genes (targets of the
high-abundance miRNAs), respectively. GO terms with
P<0.001 and FDR ≤25% were considered
statistically significant. Regarding the biological functions associated with
the predicted targets, the up-regulated genes represented 75 GO terms, amongst
which regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic processes, cell adhesion,
phosphorylation, angiogenesis, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
cascade, amongst other terms, were all correlated with active inflammation. The
GO term of regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic processes has been described
to be associated with macrophage differentiation [21,22], which is
closely related to osteoclast precursor development [23]. Furthermore, the regulation of biosynthetic processes,
regulation of cellular metabolic processes, and regulation of
nucleobase-containing compound metabolic processes ranked as the top three
over-represented GO terms and regulation of cellular metabolic process was
associated with the greatest number of genes (Figure 3A). Correspondingly, nucleic acid metabolic processes,
cellular aromatic compound metabolic processes, and nucleobase-containing
compound metabolic processes were prominent amongst the enriched GO terms for
down-regulated genes (Figure 3B).

GO analysis. The numbers shown in each section of the pie chart
represent the number of putative target genes mapped to the
corresponding GO terms. Bar graphs show the −log10
(P-value) of each GO term.

Regarding the pathway analysis, 14 and 38 statistically significant
(P<0.05) terms were identified for down-regulated
genes and up-regulated genes, respectively (Tables 2 and 3).
Amongst the pathways for up-regulated genes, the MAPK signaling pathway (Figure 4), the NF-κB signaling pathway
(Supplementary Figure S1) and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway
(Supplementary Figure S2) were highly enriched in the KEGG analysis. Other
pathways that are closely correlated with inflammation regulation and osteoclast
activity were also statistically significant, such as the PI3K-Akt signaling
pathway, the TNF signaling pathway and the TGF-β signaling pathway,
indicating that miRNAs mediate the inflammatory process through their effects on
intricate signaling pathways. In contrast, the KEGG pathway evaluation of
down-regulated genes in peri-implantitis lesions revealed that the genes were
mostly implicated in the following pathways, amongst others: phagosomes,
adherens junctions, thyroid hormone signaling, and lysosomes. Phagosomes and
lysosomes are both related to the digestion and removal of bacteria.

significantly enriched in peri-implantitis

Discussion
Peri-implant infection is initiated by biofilm accumulation around the implant
surface. At the initial stage, peri-implant mucositis is established, wherein
inflammation culminates in an acanthotic epithelium, connective tissue loss,
microvascular changes, and increased infiltration of T and B cells, neutrophils, and
macrophages [24]. The swift progression to
peri-implantitis is characterized by increased proportions of immune cells and
associated inflammatory mediators and a relatively large infiltrate that expands
apically to the junctional epithelium toward the bone marrow [17,25]. Hence,
peri-implant inflammation appears to be triggered by a set of consecutive events,
including an immune response; cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation;
and immune cell adhesion and migration. However, although peri-implant infections
are well described histopathologically, the molecular events that govern the
development of these infections have not yet been completely characterized. Certain
studies have attempted to correlate miRNAs with the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis
[26]. In particular, it has been noted
that miR-146a and miR-499 gene polymorphisms may
be genetic determinants of an increased risk of peri-implantitis in Iranians. To
date, the present study is the first to examine the expression of miRNAs in
peri-implantitis and to provide a foundation for further mechanistic experiments
aimed at dissecting the roles of miRNAs in peri-implant tissue homeostasis and
pathology.

Because high genetic heterogeneity in the human population may skew experimental
results, we established an experimental peri-implantitis model in six similar dogs
using the ligature induction method. A very high prevalence of periodontitis has
been reported in the canine population, and the histological traits of the diseased
periodontium are similar between canines and humans [27]. Moreover, the bone defects observed in ligature-induced
peri-implantitis seem to resemble naturally occurring lesions in humans [28]. RNA-Seq, as a very high-throughput
quantitative method, is reported to be highly accurate in quantitating gene
expression levels and sensitive in quantitating genes expressed at either low or
very high levels [29]. Therefore, we employed
this method to obtain miRNA expression patterns in peri-implantitis by comparing
inflamed peri-implant and healthy gingival tissues.

According to the RNA-Seq analysis, 8 and 30 miRNAs were up-regulated and
down-regulated, respectively, using the criteria P≤0.01 and
a fold-change in expression ≥1.5. These miRNAs are likely to promote disease
or to be expressed in an attempt to down-regulate immune activation and bone
resorption in peri-implantitis lesions. A well-known example of the former is
let-7e, a member of the let-7 family that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria
to humans. Specifically, let-7e acts as a key regulator of bone metabolism and
inflammation. For example, let-7e overexpression activates Th1 and Th17 cells and
aggravates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and Hashimoto’s disease
by targetting IL-10 [30,31]. Furthermore, let-7e enhances the inflammatory response in
endothelial cells and promotes proper differentiation of monocytes into osteoclasts
by stimulating both the nuclear translocation of NF-κB and activation of the
NF-κB pathway [32,33]. Immune cells activated by proinflammatory
cytokines and adhesion molecules adhere to and migrate through the vessel wall and
into inflammatory sites, followed by bone resorption.

Many of the miRNAs identified here are also known to have disease-suppressing
functions in periodontitis and other inflammatory diseases. Two examples are
miR-27a and miR-146a, which are expressed at
lower levels in diseased tissues. Notably, miR-27a functions as a
positive regulator of osteogenic differentiation via complex modulatory mechanisms
[34–36]. In addition, miR-27a is down-regulated in
macrophages following TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation and increases the expression of
IL-10, one of the most important anti-inflammatory mediators. Down-regulation of
miR-27a activates the IL-10-dependent JAK1-STAT3 pathway,
likely to be as a result of increased IL-10 expression [37]. Based on these findings, we propose that the
miR-27a down-regulation identified in the present study may act
as a negative regulatory mechanism that prevents overly exuberant TLR2- and
TLR4-driven inflammatory responses. In addition, tipping the balance between
osteoblasts and osteoclasts toward bone resorption in peri-implantitis may also
explain why miR-27a is down-regulated. The other miRNA,
miR-146a, is up-regulated upon TLR activation by LPS or by
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α in an
NF-κB-dependent manner [38,39]. Both IL-1β and TNF-α are
important mediators of the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis [9]. IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK1) and TNF receptor
associated factor-6 (TRAF6) are down-regulated by miR-146a, thereby
producing a negative feedback loop to fine-tune the immune response [40]. In contrast with most reports of
miR-146a expression in patients with periodontitis [16,41,42], the present study showed
low expression of miR-146a in inflamed peri-implant tissues.
Therefore, we readily understand the high proportions of IL-1β and
TNF-α and a more aggressive immune reaction in peri-implantitis compared with
periodontitis.

To understand the functional outcome of miRNA dysregulation, we investigated the
pathways and functions enriched in the target genes. In addition to processes
relevant to cell proliferation and basic metabolism, two of the most enriched
functions in the target genes were the regulation of macromolecule biosynthesis
processes and nitrogen-containing compound metabolic processes. Macromolecule
synthesis is the main housekeeping function of immune cells, and it is required for
immune activation [43]; macromolecules are
responsible for inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [44]. Cytokines, such as TNF-α,
IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17, have been shown to directly or indirectly promote
osteoclast differentiation and function by acting on cells of the osteoclast lineage
or other cell types to regulate expression of the key osteoclastogenic factor RANKL
and/or its inhibitor, osteoprotegerin (OPG) [45,46]. The metabolic processes
for nitrogen-containing compounds mainly involve inducible nitric oxide (NO)
synthase (iNOS) and NO. According to previous studies, iNOS induces NO production
and is required for Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) induced alveolar
bone loss in periodontal disease. Meanwhile, NO is an important element of the host
defense machinery against the periodontal pathogen Pg [47,48]. Collectively,
the GO results collected in the current study elucidated the role of the
differentially expressed miRNAs in regulating bone destruction and the expression of
immune-related genes.

RANKL, a member of the TNF superfamily, is a protein located on the membrane of
osteoblasts and their precursors that recognizes its receptor, RANK, on marrow
macrophages, prompting them to assume the osteoclast phenotype. Importantly, the
function of these cells in osteoclast metabolism has been recognized in
peri-implantitis, and RANK may be a pathological determinant of peri-implantitis
[49]. TRAF proteins are recruited
following RANKL and RANK binding and then regulate the transduction of signals from
RANK, with subsequent activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. These two
signaling pathways directly regulate the expression of osteoclastic genes, such as
CTSK, MMP-9, and TRAP, which regulate the
formation of bone resorption pits during osteoclast differentiation [50]. Interestingly, the pathways described
above, particularly the MAPK signaling pathway, are all predominantly enriched in
peri-implantitis lesions. As mentioned above, the potential target genes of
miR-146a include IRAK1 and TRAF6. These two target genes are
essential signaling components of IL-1R- and TLR-mediated NF-κB and MAPK
activation [51–53]. Thus, down-regulation of miR-146a in
peri-implantitis should diminish the inhibition of IRAK1 and TRAF6 and promote
activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. However, researchers have not
clearly determined whether miR-146a down-regulation promotes
osteoclast differentiation in peri-implantitis. Thus, future studies are warranted
to validate the function and mechanism of miR-146a in the
osteoclastogenesis of alveolar bone marrow cells.

In the present study, we used an miRNA sequence analysis to identify the miRNAs that
were differentially expressed during peri-implantitis. Bioinformatics technology
provided insights into the potential biological effects and showed particular
enrichment of target genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway. These findings
shed light on the regulatory mechanisms underlying peri-implantitis and may open new
avenues for future research into the etiology, mechanism, and treatment of
peri-implantitis. The role of certain miRNAs in peri-implantitis is currently being
investigated further.
