RP105/MD-1 Promotes Adipose Inflammation pp. 61–6
Obesity-associated tissue inflammation is a major cause of insulin resistance, and TLR (Toll-like receptor) family of proteins are increasingly recognized as players that promote adipose inflammation leading to insulin resistance in obesity. In this mini-review, authors Nagai, Watanabe and Takatsu build on previous research showing that mice lacking the TLR RP105 or its adaptor protein MD-1, display less tissue inflammation and insulin resistance when given a high fat diet and continue to highlight the significance of the RP105/MD-1 complex with regards to innate responses and diseases such as obesity and other associated metabolic disorders.

Microenvironment and Tumor Growth pp. 67–73
It is increasingly evident that tumor growth depends not only on cancer cells themselves, but also on neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment. While the contribution of neighboring fibroblasts, macrophages and vascular cells to tumor growth and metastasis is well defined, the role of the adipose tissue and adipocytes especially in breast tumors is only now beginning to be appreciated. In this mini-review, authors Wagner and Dudley examine recent studies on how adipocytes and resident adipose tissue macrophages drive inflammation and angiogenesis leading to tumor growth and progression.

Sex Chromosomes Influence the Metabolic Syndrome pp. 74–9
Obesity and other metabolic diseases have been shown to be sexually dimorphic, due to the effects of gonadal hormones influencing numerous metabolic processes. In addition, data shows that there are several genetic differences that are imposed by the sex chromosome complement of female and male cells which may also contribute to metabolic differences between the sexes. In this mini-review, Link, Chen, Arnold and Reue examine the impact of this sex chromosome complement on obesity and metabolic disease in mice and its relevance to humans.

Trafficking of Perilipin 1 to the Endoplasmic Reticulum pp. 80–6
It has previously been assumed that perilipin 1, a protein shown to coat fat droplets, was restricted to only fat droplets where it serves as a protector of energy stores by blocking fat hydrolysis. Due to this, it is used as a fat droplet marker protein, and perilipin 1 found outside of fat droplets has been dismissed as simply contamination. However, in this research paper, authors Skinner, Harris, Shew, Abumrad and Wolins look into the possibility of perilipin 1 having an expanded intracellular distribution network, and possibly moving between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and fat droplets. Their findings show that, while perolipin 1 does indeed coat fat droplets, there are also pools of the protein in the ER, which are influenced by nutritional changes within the animal.

Mechanical Properties Predict Adipose Stem Cell Differentiation pp. 87–91
ASCs, or adipose-derived stem cells, are mesenchymal stem cells that reside in adipose tissue which are able to differentiate into a diverse set of mesodermal cells including adipocytes. However, ASCs have the potential to differentiate into other cells as well (Fig. 1), and due to their abundance make them a prime source of stem cells for regenerative therapy. In this brief report, authors González-Cruz and Darling display the findings of numerous studies showing both the problems with isolating ASCs from the surrounding adipose tissue and potential sorting methods by using cellular mechanical properties as novel label-free biomarkers for lineage-specific differentiation.

Increased Muscle Mass and Metabolism pp. 92–8
Recent studies by authors McPherron, Guo, Bond and Gavrilova have shown that the increase of skeletal muscle mass brought on by the inhibition of myostatin signaling can prevent the development of lipodystrophy, a type of diabetes caused by reduced white adipose tissue and leptin. It was also shown that the inhibition of myostatin reduced the appetite for food. This commentary discusses these results as well as others related to myostatin and their relationship to muscle insulin sensitivity as well as various metabolic processes, focusing on the regulation of skeletal muscle growth and the treatment of common metabolic conditions.

CCR5: Another Player in Adipose Tissue Macrophage Recruitment pp. 99–103
While the accumulation of ATM (adipose tissue macrophage) recruited through chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is known to be an important step in developing insulin resistance, it is not known if CCR5, a different chemokine receptor, has a similar involvement in ATM recruitment. In this commentary, author Ota shows that not only does CCR5 play an important role in the development of insulin resistance, but that the number of CCR5 ATMs increase in mice in response to a high fat diet. Furthermore, it is shown that due to a reduction in ATM accumulation, Ccr5−/− mice as well as mice lacking CCR5 in myeloid cells are protected from insulin resistance and diabetes.

Heart Hormones for Weight Loss pp. 104–8
In this commentary, authors Collins and Bordicchia discuss the important realization that cardiac natriuretic peptides (NP) works in parallel and together with the SNS (sympathetic nervous system) to increase the expression of brown adipocyte maker genes and to regulate fat metabolism. Research suggests that the SNS actually can modulate the NP system in order to enhance the conditions for improved signaling between the NP and the SNS. These results may lead to therapeutic approaches to promote fat oxidation as well as weight loss through an increase of brown adipocytes and a reduction of blood pressure.

VEGF-A Promotes Brown Fat and Anti-Inflammatory Macrophages pp. 109–12
Recent studies supports the theory that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) plays a role in energy metabolism and adipose tissue function, with an overexpression of VEGF-A increasing brown adipose tissue as well as reducing diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Furthermore, VEGF-A has displayed both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties by regulating recruitment of M2 anti-inflammatory macrophages. Here, authors Elias, Franckhauser and Bosch explain the importance of VEGF-A and the role that it could play in the development of treatments for obesity and the metabolic syndrome (Fig. 2).

Linking Nutrient Sensing to Inflammation pp. 113–8
While inflammation’s role in obesity and other diseases such as type 2 diabetes is known, how nutrient sensing is linked to inflammation is not. Suppression of the protein deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SirT1) during periods of over-nutrition could be vital to the development of the kind of inflammation associated with obesity. Here, the authors show that diet-induced obesity suppresses SirT1 in macrophages, which play a pivotal role in metabolic inflammation. Due to this, it is possible that cells utilize SirT1 in order to sense nutrient status as well as regulate inflammation depending on the amount of energy available to the organism.
