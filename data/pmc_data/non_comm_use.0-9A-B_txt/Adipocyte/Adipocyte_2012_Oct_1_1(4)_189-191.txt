It’s Where It’s at, Not How Much pp. 192–9
The end distribution of accumulated fat is important when assessing the risk of metabolic disorders. If there was a choice on where to pile on the pounds, storing it peripherally is your best option. Storing it viscerally, however, is bad news. In this review, Foster and Pagliassotti summarize how obesity-induced metabolic disorders relate to the location of fat deposition and to the inherent qualities of adipocytes.

Myonectin as a Tissue Cross-Talk Mediator pp. 200–2
Maintaining energy homeostasis is diverse and complex. Throwing skeletal muscle into the equation doesn’t simplify the matter any, but it may add valuable insights into some of the networks underlying energy homeostasis. In this mini-review, Seldin and Wong look at skeletal muscle secretions, myokines, which can regulate metabolic and inflammatory responses in a para, auto and/or endocrine manner. The authors specifically focus on myonectin, a myokine they recently identified as a unifier of metabolic processes in tissues such as adipose and liver tissue, as well as promoting free fatty acid uptake into cells. Understanding the mechanisms of myonectins should help to unlock the secrets behind myokine-regulated metabolic circuits that govern energy homeostasis and can lead to metabolic disease.

Is Protein Kinase C Lambda (PKCλ) the Key to Obesity Prevention? pp. 203–14
It would be wonderful if we could just eliminate a single protein and prevent obesity. Perhaps this isn’t too far off base. In this research paper, Habegger et al. have discovered that ablation of PKCλ, an atypical member of the protein kinase C family, in hepatocytes wards off diet-induced obesity without increased energy expenditure or a reduction in caloric intake. Even more good news, glucose tolerance was improved in mice missing this enzyme. Perhaps PKCλ may become the next target in the war against rising obesity.

Pin-Pointing Bone Marrow Progenitor-Derived Adipocytes pp. 215–29
Adipocytes have different phenotypes depending on where they are located in the body. This means that they also have different impacts on health. For instance, visceral adipocytes produce higher amounts of inflammatory molecules and less adiponectin and leptin than adipocytes found in subcutaneous areas. This leaves visceral adipocytes more vulnerable to inflammation and becoming insulin resistant, both hallmarks of obesity. Fate mapping studies are important in order to figure out where these distinct adipocyte populations are originating. In this research paper, Majka et al. use new models and methods to refine and confirm their previous reports on the identification of a subpopulation of adipocytes arising from bone marrow (Fig. 1).

Finding the Maker’s Mark pp. 230–6
Targeting adipocyte tissue plasticity, perhaps by increasing anabolic or catabolic functions, could be yet another way to combat obesity-related disease. In general, adipose remodeling is poorly understood; however, progenitor cells have been identified within adipose that are most likely involved in plasticity. Exploiting these cells may lead to potential therapies; however, they first need to be identified, a tricky process as it turns out. In this brief report, Lee and Granneman discuss a surface marker, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), which identifies cells able to differentiate into both brown and white adipocytes. The authors describe and speculate on the functional roles of these specific progenitor cells and discuss possible therapeutic directions and strategies (Fig. 2).

Proliferation Strategy is Breed-Dependent pp. 237–41
Until recently, it was thought that once an adipocyte matured, it was then unable to dedifferentiate into a proliferative state. However, studies have shown that mature adipocytes do have the ability to dedifferentiate into proliferative-competent progeny cells in vitro. Interestingly, in cattle not all strains accomplish this in the same way. In this brief report, Wei et al. find an exception to the normal way that cattle adipocytes dedifferentiate and divide. The authors discover that angus-derived adipocytes divide in manner similar to swine tissue, extruding lipids before division, unlike most other bovine breeds. This work opens up an avenue for the study of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis by studying specific breeds.

Heavy Hydrogen Sheds Some Light on Adipocyte’s Life Cycle pp. 242–5
Increasing adipose tissue mass is dependent on the life cycle of the adipocyte: birth, growth and death. Too many of these cycles, however, can lead to many detrimental effects, such as insulin resistance and fat accumulation. It is important to understand the mechanisms behind this life cycle in order to prevent the harm associated with it. White and Tchoukalova discuss a refined method that uses the incorporation of deuterium into adipocyte DNA to study adipogenesis in vivo. The authors also discuss the implications that this method holds for the understanding of adipocyte hypertrophy and adipocyte death, additional mechanisms leading to cell turnover and adipose expansion.

Lose the Sam68 for a Lean Physique pp. 246–9
Sam68, a member of the STAR family of proteins, is involved in many processes, such as neurogenesis, spermatogenesis, and as recently discovered, adipogenesis. In this commentary, Huot and Richard review their recent findings surrounding a Sam68 knockout mouse. The authors find that Sam68 deficiency can lead to splicing abnormalities and reduction of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a gene known to prevent adipogenesis. Interestingly, this reduction leads to lean phenotype (Fig. 3).

Type 1 Diabetes up to BAT pp. 250–5
As opposed to white adipose tissue (WAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) can actually boost metabolism and even increase our health. In this commentary, Gunawardana reviews recent research that embryonic BAT transplants in mice can actually reverse type 1 diabetes, even without the addition of insulin. The mechanism appears to work by decreasing inflammation and increasing functionality in nearby WAT. Perhaps BAT transplants will be seen in the near future for correcting a number of metabolic related diseases.

Don't Restrict My Calories, Just My PDEs! pp. 256–8
Today, if you want to extend your lifespan, your best bet is to severely restrict the amount of calories you intake. Unfortunately, calorie restriction (CR) is quite difficult and only the most disciplined of us are able to maintain this throughout our life. One way to get around this would be to create a CR-mimetic, a chemical that would bypass the need for actual CR. In this commentary, Jay Chung reviews recent research on resveratrol, a CR-mimetic with an unresolved mechanism. It is possible that resveratrol is exacting its effects through cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which would explain why Chung was able to find evidence for a possible CR-mimetic that works by inhibiting PDEs.

The Liver Signals When It is Time to Put the Fork Down pp. 259–64
When we are full, our gastrointestinal (GI) tract sends signals to our brain telling us to stop eating. A process that all too often seems a little slow for many of us. Not all signals arise from the GI tract, however. In this commentary, Fam et al. present their recent research on the liver as an appetite-regulating organ. Using a transgenic mouse, the group found a liver regulatory enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) that regulates both appetite and adiposity. This study puts the spotlight on the liver as an organ directly involved in overall body weight regulation.

Plastic Brown Adipocytes pp. 265–70
Brown fat has distinctive properties over those of white fat. In particular, brown fat is able to stimulate thermogenesis and increase metabolism. While the jury is still out on whether humans have a high enough level of brown fat to have any anti-obesity effects, new research reveals unforeseen complexities in brown fat biology. In this commentary, Leslie Kozak discusses recent findings of brown adipocytes within the white fat of 21-day-old mice. Interestingly, these brown adipocytes are able to recover even after artificial suppression. This discovery will hopefully lead to novel ways to activate thermogenesis and fight against obesity (Fig. 4).
