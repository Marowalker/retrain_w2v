==== Body
When Ron Landes approached me last summer with the idea to launch a journal dedicated to adipose tissue research, it resonated immediately; I loved the idea. Thus, it is with great pleasure that we launch Adipocyte, the first international peer-reviewed multi-disciplinary journal to focus exclusively on research covering all aspects of adipose tissue physiology and pathology. In Adipocyte we recognize that the adipose tissue is the largest endocrine organ in the body, and we realize that a number of chronic diseases related to the ever increasing incidence of obesity worldwide including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer are linked to dysfunctional adipose tissue. The exponential growth related to adipose tissue research over the past decade will only continue to increase; adipose tissue and adipocytes will continue to be a central focus to warrant a dedicated platform of scientific exchange for those studying the biology of adipose tissue, function and disease. We believe that the broad scope of Adipocyte will differentiate it from other publications in the field, giving Adipocyte the potential to be a very successful journal.

Besides original research papers, Adipocyte will publish insightful reviews on timely, emerging topics, as well as shorter communications discussing recently published novel findings or new concepts. This inaugural issue of Adipocyte contains reviews by editorial board members sharing key questions and major developments in their respective fields. This includes an in-depth discussion on mechanisms by which nuclear receptors maintain white adipose tissue homeostasis (David Jacobi, Kristopher Stanya and Chih-Hao Lee), brown adipose tissue development and function (Kristy Townsend and Yu-Hua Tseng), recent advances in proteomics characterization of adipose tissue (David Brockman and Xiaoli Chen) and what represents a functional adipocyte (Christopher Church, Mark Horowitz and Matthew Rodeheffer). Stay tuned for more in future issues of Adipocyte.

Making the decision to launch a new scientific journal is never simple. Any journal is only as good as the quality of science, which is determined largely by the authors but also shaped by the reviewers and editorial staff, and its impact can only be evaluated after it comes into existence. We are extremely fortunate to have a panel of internationally recognized experts on the Editorial Board who support this new journal and believe that there is a need for a new publication that fosters communication and rapid exchange of information in the field of adipose research. We are indebted to everyone involved in the planning and production of Adipocyte. Thanks to Ron Landes, Kimberly Mitchell, Sara Sharpe, Elaine Ellerton, Kristine Pipit and others behind the scene who have worked tirelessly to launch this journal. And thank you to all the authors who have contributed to this inaugural issue, members of the Editorial Board and the reviewers.

If you are addressing an important question in any area of adipose tissue research we invite you to send us your manuscripts. We appreciate and respect the intellectual work and share the excitement reflected in all submitted manuscripts and will make every effort to see that your manuscript is peer reviewed fairly, providing fast and constructive feedback. We will continuously work to bolster the perception, reputation, and acceptance of Adipocyte within the research community. I hope you share our enthusiasm for the journal, and that you will become a regular contributor and reader of Adipocyte.
