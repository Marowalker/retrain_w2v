Dedifferentiation of Adipocytes: Back to the Future, pp. 122–7
While dedifferentiated fat cells (DFAT cells) may differentiate into adipocytes, they also have the ability to differentiate into other cell types. Because these DFAT cells are relatively easy to isolate, they may be an ideal source of stem cells for use in research, tissue regeneration, and other treatments. In this review, Wei et al. discuss the dedifferentiation of these mature adipocytes, the similarities and differences between DFAT cells and mesenchymal stem cells, as well as the research surrounding the conditions needed for these DFAT cells to redifferentiate into other possible cell types that could one day aid in disease treatment such as infarcted cardiac tissue repair and central nervous system recovery.

Gender Differences in Adipose Metabolism, pp. 128–34
Research has shown multiple differences between males and females with regards to the metabolic control system as well as the distribution of adipose tissue. And with diseases related to obesity reaching epidemic levels, these differences may influence the development of treatments for each respective sex. This timely review by Fuente-Martín et al. touches on recent research regarding the differences between males and females when it comes to the distribution, quantity, and metabolic capacity of white adipose tissue. The authors also emphasize the ways that sex steroid, signaling, and even high fat diet intake can differ between the two sexes, and thus showing the importance of gender-specific research in the scientific community.

Adipose Pl3K Coordinates Metabolic and Inflammatory Signals, pp. 135–42
With studies showing that adipose tissue plays a central role in obesity as well as diet-induced insulin resistance, recent research has attempted to understand the role of adipose tissue inflammation as well as the impact that adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk has on insulin sensitivity. In this mini-review, McCurdy and Klemm discuss a model in which increased expression of the regulatory subunits (p50α, p55α) of adipose phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibits insulin-stimulated Pl3K activity and promote both adipocyte insulin resistance and proinflammatory responses (Fig. 1). Pharmaceuticals that enhance PI3K activity by the suppression of its regulatory subunits could potentially be beneficial to improve systemic insulin sensitivity in obese subjects.

Obesity, Weight Loss, and the Genetic Effects of Alternative Splicing, pp. 143–7
Due to the relatively small number of protein coding genes, 95–100% of human multi-exon genes undergo alternative splicing (AS), which grants the ability to generate multiple transcripts from a single gene. In addition, the regulation of AS allows an organism to adapt to certain environmental changes, such as stress, nutrition, and even the organisms circadian clock. However Kaminska and Pihlajamäki note that this can in some cases lead to metabolic diseases, as a seemingly large number of human diseases have roots in the abnormal regulation of AS. In their mini-review the authors look at the ways that AS can be regulated, such as through both genetic variation as well as environmental cues, linking the regulation of AS to factors such as obesity and weight loss.

Isolation of Fat Cells: Flat May Be Better, pp. 148–59
Dedifferentiated adipose tissue cells (DFAT cells) have the ability to redifferentiate/transdifferentiate as well as to symmetrically/asymmetrically proliferate and replicate. However, more consistent and repeatable methods of isolation are needed in order to extract large numbers of DFAT cells. In this research paper, Wei et al. attempt two different methods of DFAT cell cultures, both the traditional cell culture flasks as well as a more non-traditional flat cell culture plate. It was found that adipocytes were easier to isolate and remove from the flat culture plates, which may provide a much more efficient way to study the dedifferentiation process of adipocytes and DFAT cells. The authors also found that DFAT cell dedifferentiation may be promoted by increased seeding density and confluence prior to induction by the differentiation induction media.

End of Mundane Manual Measurement of Adipocytes, pp. 160–4
Manual measurements of the size and number of adipocytes has long been a tedious and inconsistent practice, which limits larger scale investigations as well as introduces bias to many studies which rely on such measurements. Osman et al. present a solution to this problem with their introduction of a new automatic method which promises to provide cross-sectional area measurements of adipocytes in histological sections. Their method, which utilizes image analysis algorithms and processing, is able to isolate individual adipocytes as well as calculate and identify increases in mean adipocyte size, thus saving a tremendous amount of time and increasing consistency over manual measurement methods.

Leptin, Aromatase, and the Effect of Adipocytes on Breast Cancer Growth, pp. 165–9
In this brief report, Liu, Samad, and Mueller introduce a unique mouse model in order to observe the interactions between adipocytes and breast cancer cells in a tumor microenvironment. This microenvironment, which is increasingly important with regards to breast cancer growth and progression, has been shown to contain a high adipocyte count which can contribute to the production of endocrine, inflammatory, and angiogenic factors and thus effecting breast cancer cells in close proximity. Their results suggest that the adipocyte leptin-aromatase-estrogen axis in the tumor microenvironment drive hormone-dependent breast cancer, and that this may be an important mechanism that increases the risk of developing breast cancer in obese women.

Cathepsin D Initiates Adipocyte Death and Fuels Inflammation, pp. 170–5
States of low grade inflammation, most commonly associated with obesity are characterized by macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine production. This state plays a well-documented role in the development of insulin resistance, and, adipocyte death is proposed as an initial event that drives adipose macrophage recruitment. This brief report by Eguchi and Feldstein focuses on the activation of the lysosomal Cathepsin D and mitochondrial dysfunction in hypertrophied adipocytes early during weight gain as a potential mechanism of adipocyte death and ensuing inflammation (Fig. 2).

Tumor-Associated Inflammation and the Contribution of Adipocytes, pp. 176–83
As recent studies have shown, adipocytes may have a direct effect on tumor cell survival, proliferation, and migration. This brief report by authors Wagner, Bjerkvig, Wiig, and Dudley looks at three tumor models in order to examine the theory that dysfunctional tumor-associated adipocytes contribute to tumor inflammation. The authors found that adipose tissues in the vicinity of tumors produced three times the levels of IL-6, in turn stimulating macrophage differentiation and adhesion. Additionally, adipocytes associated with tumors exhibit membrane rupture as well as other signs of necrotic cell death, which has been known to stimulate a multitude of inflammatory responses further supporting the idea that adipose dysfunction can play a key role in tumor progression, especially in cases where the tumor is in close proximity to existing adipose tissue such as breast cancer (Fig. 3).

How Retinoic Acid Protects Mice from Diet-Induced Obesity, pp. 184–8
Adipogenesis, the formation of new fat cells and adipose tissue can be brought on through several environmental cues, such as the introduction of a high-fat diet. This commentary by Noa Noy puts the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) in the spotlight, highlighting how it can potentially protect mice from obesity brought on by a diet high in fat. The author discusses how RA is able to counteract adipogenesis by activating the CRABP-II/RAR pathway, and as a result moderates the formation and inhibiting the differentiation of new fat cells despite the presence of a high fat diet. In addition, in mature fat cells, RA is able to upregulate the expression of genes which enhance insulin response, energy dissipation, and lipid oxidation, thus further protecting the mouse from diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance.

The Possible Effects of Gut Microbiota on Inflammatory States, pp. 188–90
While not all obese individuals are insulin-resistant, multiple recent studies have reported that a variable inflammatory signature in the visceral adipose tissue of certain subpopulations of obese individuals may affect their risk of metabolic diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this commentary, author Daniel M Kemp discusses the role that chronic, low-grade endotoxemia may play with regards to obesity-related inflammatory states, as well as how changes in diet and in the gut microbiome may be even more important to metabolic health than previously thought. Kemp postulates that implications of inflammatory states having a common microbial cause could potentially lead to therapeutic research targeting multiple diseases including type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer, and atherosclerosis.
