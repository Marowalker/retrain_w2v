The image quality of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) volumes depends
greatly on the reconstruction algorithm.

Purpose
To compare two DBT reconstruction algorithms used by the Siemens Mammomat
Inspiration system, filtered back projection (FBP), and FBP with iterative
optimizations (EMPIRE), using qualitative analysis by human readers and
detection performance of machine learning algorithms.

Material and Methods
Visual grading analysis was performed by four readers specialized in breast
imaging who scored 100 cases reconstructed with both algorithms (70
lesions). Scoring (5-point scale: 1 = poor to 5 = excellent quality) was
performed on presence of noise and artifacts, visualization of skin-line and
Cooper’s ligaments, contrast, and image quality, and, when present, lesion
visibility. In parallel, a three-dimensional deep-learning convolutional
neural network (3D-CNN) was trained (n = 259 patients, 51 positives with
BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 calcifications) and tested (n = 46 patients, nine
positives), separately with FBP and EMPIRE volumes, to discriminate between
samples with and without calcifications. The partial area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (pAUC) of each 3D-CNN was used for
comparison.

Results
EMPIRE reconstructions showed better contrast (3.23 vs. 3.10,
P = 0.010), image quality (3.22 vs. 3.03,
P < 0.001), visibility of calcifications (3.53 vs.
3.37, P = 0.053, significant for one reader), and fewer
artifacts (3.26 vs. 2.97, P < 0.001). The 3D-CNN-EMPIRE
had better performance than 3D-CNN-FBP (pAUC-EMPIRE = 0.880 vs.
pAUC-FBP = 0.857; P < 0.001).

Conclusion
The new algorithm provides DBT volumes with better contrast and image
quality, fewer artifacts, and improved visibility of calcifications for
human observers, as well as improved detection performance with
deep-learning algorithms.

==== Body
Introduction
Digital mammography (DM) is currently the most used technique for breast cancer
detection, and population-based mammography screening programs have been proven to
reduce mortality among women while being cost-effective (1,2). However, mammography projects a
three-dimensional (3D) object, the breast, onto a two-dimensional (2D) image. As a
consequence, there is an inherent loss of sensitivity and specificity due to
anatomical noise arising from tissue superposition. Digital breast tomosynthesis
(DBT) can overcome the limitations of DM by providing a pseudo-3D image of the
breast (3), and many
prospective trials and retrospective studies have demonstrated the clinical benefit
of introducing DBT for breast cancer detection (4–9). Therefore, DBT might be considered a
potential candidate to replace DM for population-based screening (10,11).

DBT consists of the acquisition of several low-dose planar X-ray projections of the
compressed breast over a limited angular range, which are then reconstructed into a
pseudo-3D volume. This acquisition strategy has inherent challenges that deteriorate
image quality (3). The
limited angle acquisition gives rise to out-of-plane artefacts and low vertical
resolution (12–15), the low-dose per projection increases
the impact of noise, and X-ray scatter decreases contrast (16). The reconstruction algorithm is one of
the main aspects of image creation that could ameliorate these technical drawbacks,
and therefore can greatly affect the final quality of DBT images.

Many different reconstruction approaches have been studied over time (17). Traditionally, the
most widespread algorithm across DBT systems is filtered back projection (FBP), an
analytical reconstruction method widely used in computed tomography (CT) and adapted
for DBT (18,19). Fully iterative
reconstruction algorithms are also in use (20–22). In order to make the most out of both
approaches, FBP is recently being complemented with a posteriori
iterative optimizations, in order to reduce artifacts and noise, and increase
contrast of the DBT images (23,24),
without lengthening the reconstruction time substantially (one of the main drawbacks
of iterative reconstructions).

One manufacturer has followed this approach in their DBT system (Mammomat
Inspiration, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany), recently updating the
clinical standard reconstruction algorithm on their system from FBP to FBP with
a posteriori iterative optimizations (called EMPIRE), with
preliminary results pointing to a decrease in artifacts and noise while enhancing
image contrast of DBT volumes (23–25) (online only).

In this work, we compare this new DBT reconstruction algorithm to the previous one
using clinical patient images with two methodologies. First, in order to assess the
benefits of the new algorithm in terms of image quality and lesion depiction, we
perform a visual grading analysis (VGA) study (26) with human readers. Second, we assess
if the new DBT reconstruction algorithm provides images that also benefit automated
computer detection systems. In particular, we trained and tested two equivalent
deep-learning based 3D convolutional neural networks for the task of detecting
calcifications in DBT, one using FBP images and the other with EMPIRE images. Deep
learning is an artificial intelligence computer technique (27) that has achieved similar to superior
performance to humans for many complex medical imaging tasks (28). In mammograms, a small calcification
may indicate the presence of cancer, either in situ or invasive, thus detection is
important (29). However,
their small size (range = 0.050–3 mm) increases detection time, and certainly
deep-learning based computer systems could aid humans in this task (30).

Material and Methods
Reconstruction algorithms
The two reconstruction algorithms compared in this work are both clinical
standard algorithms used by the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration DBT system: the FBP
algorithm; and the new Enhanced Multiple Parameter Iterative Reconstruction
(EMPIRE), introduced in 2016.

The FBP algorithm for DBT is described in detail in the work by Mertelmeier
et al. (19). It
basically back projects the DBT projections after application of different
filters to account for the limited sampling of DBT in the vertical direction
throughout the breast. The EMPIRE algorithm is based on FBP, but it includes
additional processes aiming to achieve better artifact suppression, higher
resolution, and less noise (23–25).

Patient data
Out of a total of 2071 DBT patient studies acquired during clinical routine
work-up as per standard practice at our institution between December 2014 and
December 2015, 374 were consecutively collected, without any exclusion criteria,
to obtain a case set with the proportions described in Table 1. All participants consented to
participate in research studies within our institution and the need for specific
written informed consent for this study was waived by the ethics committee.
Table 1. DBT patient studies used in each experiment.

* No cases with soft tissue lesions were included in the automated
computer detection study.



All patients underwent an imaging protocol consisting of at least unilateral
one-view DBT and digital mammography with a Siemens Mammomat Inspiration DBT
system. All images were acquired in automatic exposure control mode. For a full
DBT scan, the X-ray tube moves in an arc of 50° and acquires 25 projection
images with an angular range of approximately 46°, during a total scan time of
20 s. The projection images were subsequently reconstructed by the DBT system
into a pseudo-3D volume with focal planes parallel to the detector 1 mm apart,
using the standard FBP algorithm. These raw projection images were reconstructed
using the EMPIRE reconstruction algorithm on an off-line workstation only for
this study, so this process took place well after the acquisition of each
case.

Visual grading analysis study population
For the VGA study, 100 patient unilateral mediolateral oblique (MLO) view DBT
studies were consecutively selected out of the 374 described above to achieve
the desired proportion of patient cases (Table 1): 40 biopsy proven malignant
cases; 30 biopsy proven benign cases; and 30 normal cases. The latter were
scored as BIRADS® 1 or 2 and had at least one year of negative follow-up. The
ground truth location of the lesions was annotated under the supervision of an
experienced radiologist (13 years of experience with mammography, three with
DBT) with access to pathology and radiology reports.

Automated computer detection study population
For the computer detection study, out of our set of 374 cases, all abnormal cases
due to calcifications scored as BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5 cases were selected. Cases
with calcifications were used since visibility of this type of lesion has been
proposed to be the main advantage of EMPIRE over FBP (24). No cases with soft tissue lesions
were included in this study. This yielded 60 DBT patient studies (Table 1). From these,
114 DBT volumes (either MLO, cranio-caudal [CC], or both views) were available.
Location of calcifications were annotated individually for each reconstructed
volume (independently in EMPIRE and FBP), under the supervision of the same
experienced radiologist with access to pathology and radiology reports. A sample
of 245 normal patient studies (bilateral, BI-RADS 1 or 2) was also selected for
training of the computer detection algorithms.

Visual grading analysis study
An absolute VGA observer study (26) was performed to assess several
aspects of image quality in both reconstruction algorithms. It was carried out
by four readers specializing in breast imaging (one radiologist, one clinical
PhD student, and two physicists specializing in mammography), who had a median
of 12 years of experience in breast imaging (range = 3–21 years).

Two reading sessions separated by at least two weeks were performed in order to
avoid possible bias in the results due to a direct comparison between
reconstruction algorithms of the same patient. Both reconstructions (FBP and
EMPIRE) of each patient were alternatively and randomly split between the two
reading sessions. In total, 50 FBP volumes and 50 EMPIRE volumes were scored
during each session. Scoring was performed on a 5-point scale (1 = poor quality
to 5 = excellent quality) on six aspects of normal anatomy (presence of noise
and artifacts, visualization of skin line and Cooper’s ligaments, contrast, and
overall image quality) and, when present, visibility and sharpness of both types
of lesions (calcifications and soft tissue). The location of the lesions was
outlined for the readers. The reading was performed on an in-house developed
workstation (CIRRUS Observer, Diagnostic Image Analysis Group, Nijmegen, the
Netherlands) (Fig. 1),
using high-resolution mammographic monitors of at least 5 MP. Fig. 1. In-house developed workstation for the scoring of the visual grading
analysis reader study. The readers answered ten questions on a
5-point scale (1 = poor quality to 5 = excellent quality) and the
lesions were outlined. The workstation automatically registered the
results and provided a summary report per reader after each
session.



To account for repeated measures and multiple independent reader variability, the
average results were analyzed with generalized estimating equations (GEE)
models, using as outcome the scores of each of the questions. The two-way GEE
models were built using the reconstruction algorithm and reader as main effects
as well as their interaction term. An exchangeable working correlation matrix
structure was chosen. Wald 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed.
Differences in the scores between reconstruction algorithms for each reader were
tested with the Mann–Whitney U (Wilcoxon) non-parametric test. A two-tailed
P value < 0.05 was considered to indicate significant
difference. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 24, IBM Inc.,
Armonk, NY, USA).

Computer automated detection study
A 3D deep-learning based computer detection system based on convolutional neural
networks (3D-CNN) was trained, validated, and tested for the task of detecting
suspicious calcifications (scored as BI-RADS 3, 4, or 5) in DBT images, using
data reconstructed both with EMPIRE and FBP. At the end, the performance of the
network trained and evaluated with EMPIRE data was compared to the performance
of the network trained and evaluated with FBP data. The 305 DBT patient studies
were split into training, validation, and test in a case-level to avoid bias,
with the proportions shown in Table 2. Table 2. Number of DBT patient studies, DBT image volumes, and extracted
patches used for the training, validation, and testing of the
3D-CNNs.

* Differences on a patch level between EMPIRE and FBP
reconstruction algorithms are due to different individual
calcification annotations between reconstructed volumes.



The 3D-CNN used in this study is an extension of the 2D deep-learning approach to
detect calcifications in mammography developed by Mordang et al. (31). It was trained to
discriminate between 3D DBT patches (size = 29 × 29 × 9 voxels) with and without
suspicious calcifications. More details regarding the architecture and training
strategy of the 3D-CNN can be found in Appendix 1.

The 3D-CNN with the parameters that achieved the best accuracy on the validation
data during the training was then used to compute the receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC) on the test dataset. The partial area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (pAUC) for a false-positive rate
of 0–0.05 was computed. This range was empirically defined as the range where
the largest difference of pAUC between EMPIRE and FBP was found. The pAUC was
compared between the 3D-CNN trained with FBP data (3D-CNN-FBP) and the 3D-CNN
trained with EMPIRE data (3D-CNN-EMPIRE) after bootstrapping (n = 5000), via the
Mann–Whitney U (Wilcoxon) non-parametric test. A two-tailed P
value < 0.05 was considered to indicate significant difference. All
statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB© R2017a (MathWorks, Natick, MA,
USA).

Results
Visual grading analysis study
The averaged results from the GEE model (Table 3) yielded that EMPIRE
reconstructions showed slightly better contrast (significant for one reader, the
radiologist) and fewer artifacts (significant for all readers). In general, a
better overall image quality (significant for three readers) was also assessed
for the EMPIRE DBT volumes. No significant difference was found between
reconstruction algorithms for the level of noise and the skin line
visualization, while Cooper’s ligaments were slightly better represented with
EMPIRE (significant for one reader, the radiologist). Regarding the lesion
representation of both algorithms, on average a better visibility of
calcifications was found for EMPIRE. All readers scored EMPIRE higher than FBP
for visibility of calcifications (significant for one reader, the clinical PhD
student), while no difference was found for soft tissue lesions. Table 3. Average scores (1 = poor quality to 5 = excellent quality) of each of

There was significant inter-reader variability in all the scores
(P < 0.001). Cumulative percentage of the scores of all
readers are shown in Fig.
2, which shows that EMPIRE achieves higher scores for the four most
significant aspects found on the GEE models: presence of artifacts; adequate
image contrast; visibility of calcifications; and overall image quality. For
these, the results for each reader are also shown in Fig. 3. Two examples of cases that were
scored by most readers higher with EMPIRE than with FBP for the visualization of
calcifications are shown in Fig. 4. Fig.
5 shows a case with a soft tissue lesion, equally well-visualized in
EMPIRE as in FBP. Finally, an example of a case scored by all readers as better
in EMPIRE regarding artefacts is displayed in Fig. 6. Fig. 2. Cumulative percentages of the scores (1 = poor quality, 5 = excellent
quality) across readers for the four most relevant aspects that were

and level set by the DBT system.

between EMPIRE and FBP (one reader scored EMPIRE higher than FBP).
Also note how an artefact nearby the nipple (white circle), due to a
calcification in another DBT plane, is visible in FBP but not in
EMPIRE. These images are displayed with the default window width and
level set by the DBT system.


Fig. 6. Example of patient DBT slice reconstructed with EMPIRE (left) and
standard FBP (right). All four observers scored the artefacts on the
FBP volume worse than on EMPIRE. It can be seen that for tissue near
the skin line, EMPIRE provides a better visualization compared with
FBP. Also, the large vein on the lateral side of the breast (under
the star mark) shows more overshooting artefact (shadow like
artefact, 21) in FBP than in EMPIRE. These images are displayed with
the default window width and level set by the DBT system.



Computer automated detection study
The ROC curves of the 3D-CNN for FBP and EMPIRE are shown in Fig. 7a. The 3D-CNN-EMPIRE showed similar
high performance as the one trained and tested with FBP (AUC-EMPIRE = 0.990 vs.
AUC-FBP = 0.986). This is mainly influenced by the operating points at high
false-positive rate (FPR, or 1 – Specificity), which have a sensitivity almost
equal to 1. However, at low FPRs, we observed that 3D-CNN-EMPIRE performed
better than 3D-CNN-FBP. For instance, at FPR = 0.01, 3D-CNN-EMPIRE achieved a
sensitivity of 0.958 while 3D-CNN-FBP achieved a sensitivity of 0.845. The
partial ROC curve delimited in the range with FPR of 0–0.05 is shown in Fig. 7b. After
bootstrapping, the partial AUC (pAUC) of EMPIRE is 0.880 (95% CI = 0.846–0.897),
significantly better (P < 0.001) than pAUC-FBP = 0.857 (95%
CI = 0.815–0.881). Fig. 7. Complete (a) and partial (b) ROC curves of the same 3D-CNN trained

Discussion
The comparison of breast tomosynthesis reconstruction algorithms shows that the new
EMPIRE reconstruction improves the image quality of the standard FBP reconstruction
on the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration DBT system. The VGA results yielded in average
better results for EMPIRE in some of the analyzed aspects of image quality. Also,
the 3D-CNN using EMPIRE images achieved higher performance with a better ROC curve,
specially at the range of high specificity, relevant for screening.

In general, performing additional iterative processes on the FBP reconstructed
volumes appears useful in order to enhance the visualization of DBT images, heavily
degraded due to the acquisition limitations of DBT. In particular, we have observed
that image contrast can be enhanced and the presence of artifacts reduced. In
addition, Cooper’s ligaments are slightly better visualized with EMPIRE. Cooper’s
ligaments are fibrous connective tissue between the inner side of the skin and the
pectoral muscles. Usually, changes in their structure yield a high predictive value
for malignant mass lesions (32).

Furthermore, skin line visualization was similar among both algorithms. An excellent
skin line visualization and sharpness is one of the main reported benefits of FBP in
comparison to fully iterative algorithms (17). This remains unchanged with EMPIRE.
Assessment of possible breast skin thickening anomalies is of importance since it
may be associated with malignancy (33).

As pointed out in preliminary studies (24), it has been confirmed in our study
that the new EMPIRE algorithm significantly improves the visibility of
calcifications in the DBT volumes for humans. In addition, we also showed a similar
benefit for a deep-learning based computer detection system when it comes to
classification of calcifications. The higher contrast of calcifications achieved by
EMPIRE, combined with a similar visualization of soft tissue lesions, suggests that
EMPIRE might improve the clinical performance of DBT for lesion detection in a
clinical setting.

A topic of future work is to study the impact of the EMPIRE algorithm on tests
designed for quality control of the reconstructed slices of breast tomosynthesis
(13). Moreover,
further expansion of the 3D-CNN for EMPIRE is also still required, since here we
just used a basic network while, similar techniques can also be applied in order to
detect/classify groups of calcifications, as well as other types of lesions.

A limitation of this study is the fact that an actual detection reader study was not
performed to account for lesion visibility. In addition, some of the observers were
not breast radiologists, but given the non-clinical task of evaluating image
quality, we believe this is a minor limitation. Also, the medical physicist
observers provided the least number of significantly different assessments between
the two reconstruction algorithms in the VGA study. Therefore, any potential bias
would be in favor of the FBP algorithm.

It should also be noted that, although images from both algorithms were objectively
and independently annotated, not the same calcifications were included for
evaluation of the 3D-CNN with EMPIRE and FBP. We observed that more calcifications
were annotated in EMPIRE. This might support that calcification visibility for human
observers is higher in EMPIRE. As a consequence, this might lead to a bias in favor
of FBP, since likely many true-positive calcifications for EMPIRE were labeled as
true negatives in FBP, while they could have been considered as false negatives.

In conclusion, the new EMPIRE reconstruction algorithm, in comparison with FBP,
provides breast tomosynthesis volumes with better contrast and overall image
quality, fewer artifacts, and improved visibility of calcifications according to the
human observers, as well as improved detection capability in deep-learning systems.
As a consequence, this new algorithm might enhance DBT clinical performance of
radiologists and improve the accuracy of deep-learning based computer detection
systems.
