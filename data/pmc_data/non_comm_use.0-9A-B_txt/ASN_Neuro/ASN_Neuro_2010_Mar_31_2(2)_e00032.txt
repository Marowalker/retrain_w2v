                    death. Gene dosage experiments in mice, yielding a single wild-type
                    Bax allele, indicated that genetic background was able to
                    influence the cell death phenotype. DBA/2JBax+/− mice exhibited complete resistance to nerve damage after 2 weeks
                    (similar to Bax−/− mice), but 129B6Bax+/− mice exhibited significant cell loss (similar to wild-type mice). The
                    different cell death phenotype was associated with the level of
                    Bax expression, where 129B6 neurons had twice the level of
                    endogenous Bax mRNA and protein as DBA/2J neurons. Sequence
                    analysis of the Bax promoters between these strains revealed a
                    single nucleotide polymorphism (T129B6 to CDBA/2J) at
                    position −515. A 1.5- to 2.5-fold increase in transcriptional
                    activity was observed from the 129B6 promoter in transient transfection assays
                    in a variety of cell types, including RGC5 cells derived from rat RGCs. Since
                    this polymorphism occurred in a p53 half-site, we investigated the requirement
                    of p53 for the differential transcriptional activity. Differential
                    transcriptional activity from either 129B6 or DBA/2J Bax
                    promoters were unaffected in p53−/− cells, and
                    addition of exogenous p53 had no further effect on this difference, thus a role
                    for p53 was excluded. Competitive electrophoretic mobility-shift assays
                    identified two DNA–protein complexes that interacted with the
                    polymorphic region. Those forming Complex 1 bound with higher affinity to the
                    129B6 polymorphic site, suggesting that these proteins probably comprised a
                    transcriptional activator complex. These studies implicated quantitative
                    expression of the Bax gene as playing a possible role in
                    neuronal susceptibility to damaging stimuli.

INTRODUCTION
Neuronal apoptosis is widespread during the development of the nervous system and in
                chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease,
                amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and
                Alzheimer’s disease (Akhtar et al.,
                2004; Kermer et al., 2004; Lindholm et al., 2004; Conforti et al., 2007). RGC (retinal ganglion cell) death, and
                the degeneration of their axons in the optic nerve, is the principal characteristic
                of blinding optic neuropathies such as glaucoma (Nickells, 2007). Previously we, and others, have documented an essential
                role for Bax expression and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in the
                process of RGC death in development, after acute nerve trauma and in a mouse model
                of chronic glaucoma (Isenmann et al., 1997;
                    Mosinger Ogilvie et al., 1998; Isenmann et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000; Libby et al.,
                    2005a).

The intrinsic apoptotic pathway involves mitochondrial dysfunction and is regulated
                by members of the Bcl2 gene family (Adams and Cory, 2007). In this pathway, the molecular events leading to
                cell death cause the release of cytochrome c through
                permeabilization of the mitochondria by the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK. The
                release of cytochrome c subsequently activates the caspase cascade
                via its association with pro-caspase 9 and the apoptosis protease activating
                factor-1 (Danial and Korsmeyer, 2004; Adams and Cory, 2007). In most cell types, the
                functions of BAX and BAK are similar, and therefore redundant with the exception of
                some cancer cells (Zhang et al., 2000) and
                many neurons (Knudson et al., 1995; Deckwerth et al., 1996; White et al., 1998), in which BAX is the central mediator of
                apoptosis. In neurons, the exclusive role for BAX may result from alternative
                splicing of Bak transcripts, which result in the translation of a
                truncated form of BAK (N-BAK) containing only the BH3 domain (Uo et al., 2005).

Mouse genetic studies manipulating the Bax gene showed that
                    Bax knockout mice on a mixed 129/Sv and C57BL/6 background
                (129B6) (Knudson et al., 1995) exhibited
                reduced developmental neuronal death throughout the central and peripheral nervous
                system compared with wild-type mice (Deckwerth et
                    al., 1996; Mosinger Ogilvie et al.,
                1998; White et al., 1998). Similarly,
                    Bax deficiency prevented sympathetic neuron death in the
                absence of nerve growth factor in culture. In vivo,
                Bax deficiency promoted motor neuron survival following both facial
                and sciatic nerve axotomy, and RGC survival following ONC (optic nerve crush) (Deckwerth et al., 1996; Li et al., 2000; Sun and
                    Oppenheim, 2003). In Bax+/− mice,
                however, developmental apoptosis of sympathetic and facial motor neurons, and RGCs,
                was comparable with wild-type mice. In addition, motor neuron death after facial
                nerve axotomy was comparable between Bax+/−
                and wild-type mice (Deckwerth et al., 1996;
                    Mosinger Ogilvie et al., 1998).
                Collectively, these studies suggested that expression from a single copy of
                    Bax was sufficient to execute apoptosis in mice with the 129B6
                mixed genetic background.

Similar to 129B6 mice, complete Bax deficiency in the DBA/2J mouse
                line prevented RGC soma death during glaucoma and after ONC (Libby et al., 2005a). DBA/2J mice develop chronic secondary
                glaucoma at 10–12 months of age characterized by elevated intraocular
                pressure, optic nerve degeneration, and the progressive loss of RGCs (Chang et al., 1999; Libby et al., 2005b; Schlamp et
                    al., 2006). In contrast with 129B6 mice, however, DBA/2J mice
                heterozygous for the Bax allele did not exhibit significant RGC
                death shortly after ONC and in glaucoma, whereas wild-type animals did (Libby et al., 2005a). Thus reduced
                Bax expression, at least on some genetic backgrounds, was able to
                significantly affect RGC soma susceptibility to optic nerve damage.

In the present study, we examine the underlying cause for the differential cell death
                phenotype between 129B6 and DBA/2J mice heterozygous for the mutant
                Bax allele. This difference is associated with higher levels of
                latent Bax mRNA and protein in the neurons of 129B6 mice. Promoter
                analysis also identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in the
                Bax promoter of each strain, which can significantly alter the
                level of expression of this gene, and affect the binding affinity of nuclear
                proteins.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Mice used in the present study were maintained and handled in accordance with the
                    guidelines established by the Association for Research in Vision and
                    Ophthalmology Statement on Animals in Research and overseen by the Animal Care
                    and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin. A colony of mice deficient for
                        Bax (Knudson et al.,
                    1995) was established from breeders obtained from the late Dr Stanley
                    Korsmeyer and maintained as an inbred population. In this line, the null allele
                    was initially generated in 129/Sv-derived embryonic stem cells, which were
                    introduced into C57BL/6 embryos. We have designated these mice as 129B6 because
                    of their mixed genetic background. DBA/2J mice congenic for the
                    Bax null allele (Libby et al.,
                        2005a) were generously provided by Dr Simon John (Bar Harbor, ME,
                    U.S.A.). FVB mice were a gift from Dr Paul Lambert (School of Medicine and
                    Public Health, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, U.S.A.).

ONC and ganglion cell counting
ONC surgery was performed as described previously (Li et al., 1999). ONC causes synchronous RGC death in the
                    ganglion cell layer, which accounts for 50–60% of the neurons in this
                    layer. Only the left eye of each mouse underwent surgery, leaving the other eye
                    as a control. The loss of cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer was
                    quantified as described previously (Li et al.,
                        2007).

Cell culture
All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5%
                        CO2 and media replaced every 2–3 days. NIH 3T3 cells,
                    an immortalized murine fibroblast cell line, were a gift from Dr Donna Peters
                    (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin,
                    Madison, WI, U.S.A.). The cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco’s
                    modified Eagle’s medium) containing 4.5 g/l glucose with
                    l-glutamine (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum)
                    (Atlanta Biologicals) and with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Cambrex). NIH 3T3
                    cells were passaged at 70–80% confluency. RGC-5 cells (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001), an
                    immortalized rat retinal ganglion cell line, were a gift from Dr Neeraj Agarwal
                    (Vision Research Program, National Eye Institute, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.). RGC-5
                    cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 g/l glucose and 1%
                    penicillin/streptomycin. Primary lung fibroblasts from 2-month-old FVB mice
                        (p53+/+ and p53−/− genotypes)
                    and 3-month-old DBA/2JBax+/+ mice were isolated as described previously (Konigsberg et al., 2004). Briefly, lungs
                    from each mouse were aseptically dissected and minced into ∼1 mm
                    pieces. The tissue was washed three times with PBS containing 2%
                    penicillin/streptomycin and treated with 0.25% trypsin for 10 min. The tissue
                    was washed again with PBS and treated for 5 h with 169 units/mg of 0.3%
                    collagenase type I (Worthington). The dissociated cells and tissue were split
                    into three 10-cm-diameter plates in 4.5 g/l glucose-containing DMEM with
                    l-glutamine, 15% FBS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The resulting
                    fibroblasts were allowed to become confluent before being passed. Cells were
                    cryogenically frozen after 10 days in culture until use. All experiments using
                    primary fibroblasts were performed at the third passage.

Clones and plasmids
A 3091 bp genomic fragment containing the DBA/2J or 129B6 Bax
                    promoter region, including exon 1 and half of intron 1, was PCR-amplified using
                    LA Taq (Takara). The primer sequences used were:
                    5′-GATTAGGTTGGCTTGTTTGTGG (forward) and
                    5′-CTAGTAGTGACAAGTAGCATGG (reverse). Nhe1 and Bgl II sites were
                    engineered into the promoter regions by nested PCR to isolate 1370 bp directly
                    upstream of the start codon using the primers
                    5′-GTGATCTTACGCTAGCTTCCTGCGTTCTGAGG (forward containing Nhe1) and
                    5′-CGAACTGTCTAGATCTCACTGCCGCTGCCTCTCG (reverse containing BglII). The
                    nucleotide directly upstream of the start codon was considered −1 and
                    the numbering of all other nucleotides is relative to this position. This
                    fragment was directionally cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega), a Luc (luciferase)
                    expression vector, to create the DBA/2J–Luc and 129B6–Luc
                    reporter constructs. The expression plasmid containing human p53 under the
                    control of the CMV promoter (pC53-SN3) was a gift from Dr Mary Ellen
                    Perry (National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, U.S.A.) and the plasmid
                    containing 13 p53 response elements (Kern et
                        al., 1992) with a Luc reporter (pG13-Luc) was a gift from
                    Dr Bert Vogelstein (Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins
                    University, Baltimore, MD, U.S.A.). All clones were sequenced at the University
                    of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The pGL3-Basic plasmid was used as a negative
                    control for Luc experiments, pGL3-Control (Promega) was used as a positive
                    control, and pSV-βgal (βgal, β-galactosidase)
                    (Promega) was used to determine transfection efficiency.

RNA isolation and quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from whole retina tissue and cultured cells using
                    Tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, U.S.A.). First-strand
                    cDNA was synthesized using oligo-dT as a primer, and quantitative PCR was
                    performed using the ABI (Applied Biosystems) 7300 real-time PCR system and ABI
                    SYBR Green PCR Master Mix as described previously (Pelzel et al., 2006). Standard curves were generated for
                    each product using cloned cDNAs for Bax, Bcl-X
                    and the S16 ribosomal protein to quantify the abundance of cDNA
                    in each sample. The Bax coding region (627 bp fragment) was
                    isolated from DBA/2J and 129B6 retinal cDNA with the following primers:
                    5′-ACCCGCCGAGAGGCAGCG (forward) and 5′-CACAGTCCCAGGCAGTGGG
                    (reverse) and blunt-end cloned the SmaI site of pBK-CMV (Stratagene).
                        BclX was blunt-end cloned into pBK-CMV using the primers
                    5′-CATCTCACCTACCAGTCA (forward) and 5′-GTCAGAGTGGATGGTCAGT
                    (reverse). A cDNA for S16 (199 bp fragment) was also blunt-end
                    cloned using 129B6 cDNA and primers 5′-CACTGCAAACGGGGAAATGG (forward)
                    and 5′-TGAGATGGACTGTCGGATGG (reverse).

For standard curves, a dilution series of cloned Bax, Bcl-X and
                        S16 templates ranging from 102 to 109
                    copies were used. The quantitative PCR cycling parameters were: 1 cycle of
                    95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s
                    and 60°C for 1 min. Data collection was taken at the 60°C
                    annealing/extension phase. In order to ensure the presence of a single product,
                    a dissociation curve was performed after each run and products were visualized
                    on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. Data were collected from threshold
                    values using the automatic function of the 7300 System Sequence Detection
                    Software program. The primers used to quantify Bax cDNA yielded
                    a 220 bp fragment that spanned intron 3: 5′-TTCATCCAGGATCGAGCAGG
                    (forward) and 5′-CATCAGCAAACATGTCAGC (reverse). The primers used to
                    quantify BclX cDNA yielded a 275 bp fragment:
                    5′-GCATCGTGGCCTTTTTCTCC (forward) and
                    5′-CGACTGAAGAGTGAGCCCAG (reverse). All cDNA levels were normalized to
                    murine S16 ribosomal protein cDNA, which was quantified using
                    the same primers that were used to clone S16 above. All primers
                    crossed at least one intron/exon boundary. All PCR products generated with these
                    primers were also sequenced to verify identity.

Transfections
NIH 3T3 cells were plated into 60 cm plates at a density of
                    1×105 cells/plate. RGC-5 cells and primary fibroblasts
                    were plated into six-well plates with a density of 3×104
                    cells/well. All cells were transfected 24 h after initial plating. Transfections
                    were performed using the Tfx-50 transfection reagent (Promega) with a 2:1
                    transfection reagent/DNA ratio for primary fibroblasts and RGC-5 cells and a 3:1
                    ratio for NIH 3T3 cells. Plasmid DNAs used for transfection were 2 μg
                    of either DBA/2J–Luc or 129B6–Luc along with 1
                    μg of pSV-βgal to control for transfection efficiency.
                    Empty pGL3-Basic was used as a negative control in all experiments and
                    pGL3-Control was used as a positive control. For transfections into
                        p53−/− fibroblasts, Luc reporter plasmids
                    were co-transfected with pSV-βgal and 1 μg of either
                    pGL3-Basic or pC53-SN3 plasmids. For primary fibroblasts and RGC-5
                    cells, the transfection medium was replaced after 5 h with complete medium in
                    order to increase viability. In NIH 3T3 cells, however, complete medium was
                    added directly to the transfection medium after 1 h. Reporter gene activity was
                    typically measured 48 h after transfection, except where noted. Luc activity was
                    measured with Luc assay reagent (Promega) using a Turner TD-20e Luminometer
                    (Sunnyvale, CA) and β-gal activity was measured using
                    β-gal assay reagent (Promega) and reading the absorbance at 420 nm in
                    a spectrophotometer.

EMSA (electrophoretic mobility-shift assay)
EMSA and unlabelled competition EMSA were performed using double-stranded 30 bp
                    oligonucleotides encompassing the polymorphic site from −499 to
                    −528 of the 129B6 or DBA/2J Bax promoters. When
                    making probes for EMSA, complementary strands of the 30 bp 129B6 or DBA/2J
                        Bax promoter regions (400 pmol) were annealed in 100
                    μl of annealing buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 20 mM NaCl). The
                    double-stranded oligonucleotides (16 pmol) were end-labelled using
                        [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham) and T4
                    Polynucleotide Kinase (Promega). Free radioactivity was removed using
                        illustraTM Microspin G-25 Columns (Amersham). Probes were counted
                    in a Packard TRI CARB 2100TR liquid scintillation analyser (Canberra, Meriden,
                    CT, U.S.A.). NIH 3T3 nuclear extract was purchased from Santa Cruz
                    Biotechnology. Whole retinal nuclear protein isolations were performed as
                    described previously (Andrews and Faller,
                    1991). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were incubated for 10 min at
                    room temperature (22°C) with binding buffer [5 mM MgCl2,
                    2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 250 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH
                    7.5] and 3 μg of dI-dC (Amersham) per lane. A 32P-labelled
                    probe (600 000 c.p.m./lane; ∼0.12 pmol) was then added in
                    the presence of excess (6.25- to 150-fold where noted) or absence of unlabelled
                    competitor oligonucleotides and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The
                    reactions were run on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris-borate
                    EDTA buffer at 250 V for 2 h. Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager
                    screen (Molecular Dynamics), scanned on a Storm 860 scanner (Amersham), and band
                    density was quantified using ImageQuant software v5.2 (Amersham).

Immunoblotting
Immunoblots were performed as described previously (Azarian et al., 1993) with a few modifications. Whole brain
                    lysates (60 μg/lane) from 129B6 and DBA/2J mice were used in the
                    assay. Protein concentration was quantified using a BCA (bicinchoninic acid)
                    protein assay (Pierce). The following antibodies were utilized to detect
                    specific antigens. Polyclonal antibodies developed in rabbit, anti-BAX antibody
                    (B3428) and anti-actin antibody (A2066) were purchased from Sigma and used at
                    1:2000 and 1:100 dilutions respectively. The secondary antibody was
                    alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated and the blot was visualized utilizing ECF
                    Substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were scanned on a Storm 860 scanner
                    (Amersham), and band density quantified using ImageQuant software v5.2
                    (Amersham).

Quantitative analysis of BCL-X and BAX protein levels were examined using blot
                    strips. Equal protein amounts of retinal lysates were each run in single
                    oversized lanes on 12% polyacrylamide gels. After transblotting to Immobilon-P
                    membranes, each lane was divided into three equal-sized strips, and each strip
                    was individually probed with polyclonal antibodies for actin, BAX or BCL-X
                    (sc-634, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.; 1:1000 dilution).
                    After probing with secondary antibody, the blots were developed using
                    colorimetric staining for alkaline phosphatase activity in Nitro-Blue
                    Tetrazolium and BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl phosphate). Staining for BCL-X
                    and BAX was allowed to continue until one of the comparative strips had reached
                    saturation.

In silico analysis
The 10 bp core sequence from the 129B6 Bax promoter, AGGTTTGCCT,
                    was entered as a search term in a number of different transcription factor
                    databases all available online: JASPAR (http://mordor.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/jaspar2005/jaspar_db.pl), TESS
                        (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/cgi-bin/tess/tess), TFSearch
                        (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) and MatInspector
                    from Genomatix (http://www.genomatix.de).
                    For the initial screen of transcription factors putatively binding to the core
                    sequence, any sequence not possessing at least 60% homology with the core was
                    eliminated. Other parameters taken into account were
                    transcription-factor-binding sequences that matched a portion of the core
                    sequence, including the polymorphic site, with high sequence similarity and in
                    the correct succession of base pairs. The likelihood of that particular
                    transcription factor being expressed in mouse neurons was also considered.

Statistical analyses
For data presented as means±S.E.M., assessment for significant
                    differences between groups was performed by Student’s
                    t test. The data from quantified EMSA gels were plotted,
                    best-fit curves generated, and IC50 values were calculated using
                    Kaleidagraph 4 software (Synergy Software).

RESULTS
Genetically distinct mice, heterozygous for mutant Bax,
                    display susceptible or resistant RGC death phenotypes in response to ONC
ONC in mice causes the selective death of RGCs that generally progresses to
                    maximal cell loss by 3 weeks after surgery in wild-type animals (Li et al., 1999; Li et al., 2007). We initially investigated the effects of
                        Bax gene dosage on RGC survival in 129B6 mice and DBA/2J
                    mice at an intermediate term period (2 weeks) after ONC (Figure 1A). DBA/2JBax+/+ mice had 66% cells remaining, which represents a loss of
                    34.0±2.45% of the cells in the ganglion cell layer relative to the
                    control retina (P<0.001). Likewise, 129B6Bax+/+ mice had 62.3% of their cells remaining, or a loss of
                    37.7±5.3% of the cells in the ganglion cell layer relative to control
                    retinas (P<0.005). DBA/2JBax−/− and 129B6Bax−/− were completely resistant to the
                    damaging effects of ONC (P>0.25 for DBA/2JBax−/−,
                    P>0.10 for 129B6Bax−/− relative to control). Importantly,
                    animals heterozygous for Bax exhibited distinctly different
                    phenotypes. 129B6Bax+/− mice displayed significant cell death after
                    ONC (P<0.005), similar to wild-type animals. DBA/2JBax+/− displayed no significant cell death
                        (P>0.25), similar to
                        Bax−/− animals. The
                    results observed for 129B6Bax+/− and DBA/2JBax+/− were consistent with previously published
                    reports of cell death after acute nerve trauma in these two lines (Deckwerth et al., 1996; Libby et al., 2005a). In order to examine
                    if there was long-term protection of RGCs in
                        Bax+/− mice, experiments examining
                    RGC loss in resistant DBA/2JBax+/− mice at both 3 and 8 weeks post-ONC were
                    performed (Figures 1B–1G). Mice
                    at 3 weeks after ONC still showed dramatic preservation of cells in the ganglion
                    cell layer (∼90% of control retinas), but a significant loss of cells
                    by 8 weeks (72.3±3.4% cells remaining,
                        P = 2.85×10−6).
                    This loss of cells was still well below that for
                    Bax+/+ mice at 3 weeks, which exhibited only
                    45.8±1.7% of the cells present in control retinas, and probably
                    accounts for complete elimination of the RGC population in this retinal layer.
                    Conversely, Bax−/− RGC somas
                    survive up to 18 months after optic nerve damage, exhibiting more than 92% cells
                    remaining at that point.

                            mice. Both 129B6Bax−/− and DBA/2JBax−/− mice showed no significant
                            loss of cells relative to control eyes
                            (P>0.10 and
                            P>0.25 respectively), whereas wild-type mice
                            showed significant loss (P<0.005). DBA/2JBax+/− mice displayed a knockout phenotype,
                            showing no significant loss (**P>0.25),
                            whereas 129B6Bax+/− exhibited significant cell loss
                            similar to wild-type animals (*P<0.001).
                            After a prolonged period after ONC, however, resistant heterozygous mice
                            also exhibit cell loss. (B–F)

                            weeks after ONC. These mice exhibit moderate cell loss and partial
                            atrophy, typified by cell soma shrinkage of the remaining ganglion cell
                            population, which is common in Bax-deficient neurons
                            after damage (Li et al., 2000;
                                Sun and Oppenheim, 2003).

                            mouse, 3 weeks after ONC. These mice typically exhibit a maximum loss of
                            ganglion cells by this stage. A cell undergoing apoptosis is indicated
                            by the arrow. (F) Retina from a

                            nerve, there is minimal loss of cells in the ganglion cell layer. Note
                            that Bax−/− animals
                            have a higher density of ganglion cells than either wild-type or
                            heterozygous mice because of the lack of Bax-dependent
                            programmed cell death, which normally prunes approx. 50% of the ganglion
                            cell population during the first few weeks of life (Mosinger Ogilvie et al., 1998;
                                Pequignot et al., 2003).

                            examined. Bax heterozygous animals were on the DBA/2J
                            background, whereas
                            Bax−/− mice were on
                            the 129B6 background for this experiment. A total of five to seven mice
                            were analysed for each condition, except for
                                Bax−/− mice at 18
                            months, in which two mice were examined.
                                (*P = 2.85×10−6
                            and
                                **P = 7.78×10−18,
                            both compared with control fellow eyes of mice used in each group).

DBA/2JBax+/− and 129B6Bax+/− mice express different neuronal levels of
                        Bax
We then examined if the variation in susceptibilities between heterozygous DBA/2J
                    and 129B6 mice was either due to a difference in BAX protein function caused by
                    an amino acid substitution or the level of expression. Sequence analysis of
                    cDNAs isolated from the DBA/2J and 129B6 strains yielded no difference in
                    predicted amino acid structure (data not shown). This ruled out the possibility
                    that a difference in BAX protein function as a consequence of an amino acid
                    sequence difference was the underlying cause of the phenotype. We then
                    investigated whether there was a difference in neuronal Bax
                    expression. Quantitative PCR was used to quantify Bax mRNA
                    levels in the retinas of 129B6 and DBA/2J mice (Figure 2A). As the number of RGCs that populate the ganglion cell
                    layer in DBA/2J and 129B6 retinas are comparable, and Bax mRNA
                    has been shown to be principally localized to the RGC layer of adult rats (Shin et al., 1999), we used whole retinal
                    cDNA for analysis. In each strain, neuronal Bax mRNA levels
                    were reduced by approx. 50% in heterozygous mice relative to wild-type mice.
                        Bax−/− mice of either
                    strain expressed no detectable Bax mRNA. Retinas from 129B6
                    mice contained twice the level of Bax mRNA compared with DBA/2J
                    mice, such that 129B6Bax+/− and DBA/2JBax+/+ animals had similar levels of Bax
                    transcripts (P = 0.46) (Figure 2A). Consistent with the mRNA levels, 129B6Bax+/+ neurons expressed 1.2- to 1.8-fold (range for three
                    separate experiments) the BAX protein level as DBA/2JBax+/+ neurons (Figure
                    2B). Similarly, BAX protein measurements indicated that 129B6Bax+/− neurons had between 1.4- and 2.0-fold (range
                    for three separate experiments) the amount of BAX protein as DBA/2JBax+/− neurons.
                        Bax−/− mice expressed no
                    detectable BAX protein (Figure 2B). These
                    observations correlated the higher susceptibility to ONC observed in
                        129B6+/− mice (Figure
                    1A) with latent levels of Bax mRNA and protein.

                            transcript levels (means±SEM) in 129B6 and DBA/2J mice.
                            Values shown are the number of Bax mRNA molecules [per
                            2.5 pg of poly(A) RNA input] normalized to the number of
                            S16 molecules in each sample. Reducing
                            Bax gene dosage to one gene caused a 50% reduction of
                                Bax transcripts (for 129B6,
                            P = 0.004, for DBA/2J,
                                P = 0.002, control
                            retinas of Bax+/− mice compared
                            with control retinas of Bax+/+ mice) and no
                            transcripts were detected in knock-out mice. Similarly, 129B6 mice had
                            approximately twice the amount of Bax mRNA in the
                            retina (*129B6Bax+/+ compared with DBA/2JBax+/+ mice,

                            levels in DBA/2J and 129B6 neurons. Bax protein levels were 1.2- to
                            1.8-fold higher in 129B6Bax+/+ mice compared with DBA/2JBax+/+ mice (when normalized to actin in each lane).
                            Similarly, 129B6Bax+/− mice expressed 1.4- to 2.0-fold as
                            much Bax as DBA/2JBax+/− mice. No Bax protein was detected in
                                Bax−/− mice.

                            each strain. Unlike Bax mRNA, no difference in
                                BclX mRNA was detected between strains
                            (P = 0.26), or between
                            wild-type and knockout mice (data not shown). (D) Blot
                            strips taken from the same lanes of retina homogenates of wild-type
                            DBA/2J or 129B6 mice. To accurately assess the relative levels of BAX
                            and BCL-X, the strips were developed equally, until BCL-X staining began
                            to saturate the colorimetric reaction. BCL-X shows up as two prominent
                            bands, probably reflecting modified and deamidated polypeptides (Johnstone, 2002). BAX levels, under
                            these conditions, are just detectable. Chemiluminescence detection of
                            BAX staining clearly shows, however, that this antibody specifically
                            interacted with BAX protein in similar samples (see B).
                            Actin was also evaluated as a loading control. (E)
                            Histogram showing changes in Bax transcript abundance
                            (means±S.E.M.), 4 days after ONC. Retinal transcript levels
                            were examined at 4 days after injury when others have reported moderate
                            increases in Bax mRNA after optic nerve axotomy (Näpänkangas et al.,
                                2003). ONC caused a 42.0±13.2% decrease in
                                Bax mRNA in DBA/2J mice relative to control eyes
                                (*P = 0.003) and a
                            79.0±3.8% decrease in 129B6 mice relative to control eyes
                                (**P = 4.6×10−5).
                            The control retinas of 129B6Bax+/+ mice contained 2.2-fold the amount of
                                Bax mRNA compared with control DBA/2JBax+/+ retinas
                                (P = 2.0×10−4).
                            Thus Bax expression was not differentially increased
                            between strains, and instead showed a relative decrease after
                        injury.

Even though the lower levels of latent Bax mRNA and protein in
                    DBA/2J mice were associated with resistance to ONC in heterozygous animals, we
                    investigated if other factors may also be affecting this phenotype. Since cell
                    death is influenced in a stoichiometric fashion by the levels of anti-apoptotic
                    and BH3-only members of the Bcl2 gene family, we also examined
                    mouse retinas for the expression of antagonistic anti-apoptotic genes.
                    Previously, we had described BclX as the dominant
                    anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family member expressed in the retina
                        (Levin et al., 1997). No significant
                    difference in BclX transcript level was observed between
                        Bax+/+ and
                        Bax−/− of each strain (data not
                    shown). Importantly, there was no significant difference in
                    BclX transcript levels between 129B6Bax+/− and DBA/2JBax+/−
                    (P = 0.26, Figure 2C). Furthermore, in direct
                    quantitative analyses of the same tissues, BclX transcripts
                    were also 5–10-fold more abundant than Bax
                    transcripts (compare Figure 2A with Figure 2C). To verify that there was also in
                    increased level of BCL-X protein, predicted by the mRNA levels, we examined
                    relative BCL-X and BAX protein concentrations in retina homogenates of wild-type
                    129B6 and DBA/2J mice. Strips cut from the same lanes of sample run on SDS/12%
                    polyacrylamide gels were individually probed with antibodies against BCL-X, BAX
                    and actin (to control for loading differences). Strips developed for equal
                    periods of time for BCL-X and BAX showed a strong reaction for BCL-X, but BAX
                    levels were only just detectable (Figure
                    2D). Thus, BCL-X protein levels appeared to be in excess over BAX in both
                    samples, consistent with the quantitative PCR data.

Some studies have suggested that Bax expression is increased in
                    RGCs after optic nerve damage (Isenmann et al.,
                        1997; Näpänkangas et al., 2003). Although this
                    increase in expression has been refuted by others (McKinnon et al., 2002), we nevertheless explored the
                    possibility that Bax was differentially up-regulated after
                    crush in the two mouse lines. Quantitative analysis of Bax
                    transcript levels in mouse retinas 4 days after ONC indicated that
                    Bax mRNA levels were not induced in the retina (Figure 2E). Instead, each strain exhibited a
                    significant decrease in transcript abundance (DBA/2J Control compared with 129B6

                    DBA/2J Control compared with DBA/2J Crush,
                    P = 0.003; 129B6 Control
                    compared with 129B6 Crush,

A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the Bax gene promoter is
                    associated with a decrease in transcriptional activity
To investigate the mechanism underlying differential Bax
                    expression, we examined the promoter regions for differences in
                    cis-element sequences. For this, we cloned 1370 bp of the
                        Bax promoter regions directly upstream of the translation
                    start site from the DBA/2J and 129B6 mouse lines and compared them by sequence
                    analysis. Both promoters were identical with the exception of a single T (in
                    129B6) to a C (in DBA/2J) polymorphism at position −515 upstream from
                    the start of translation (Figure 3). This
                    polymorphism was verified in six independent mice of each strain. Analysis of
                    potential binding sites in this region showed that the polymorphism existed
                    within a potential p53 half-site in the DBA/2J line. We tested the ability of
                    this polymorphism to affect transcription in vitro by fusing
                    1370 bp of the promoter region of each strain to a Luc reporter gene. Transient
                    transfection experiments into both non-neuronal NIH 3T3 cells and RGC-derived
                    RGC-5 cells showed that 129B6–Luc consistently exhibited 1.5-fold the
                    expression level of DBA/2J–Luc in immortalized cells
                        (P = 3×10−4
                    and
                        P = 1.71×10−12
                    respectively, Figure 4). Transient
                    transfections into primary fibroblasts isolated from DBA/2J and FVB mice showed
                    129B6–Luc expression to be 2.5- and 2.3-fold higher than
                    DBA/2J–Luc expression
                    (P = 0.002 and
                        P = 2.82×10−6
                    respectively), which was similar to the difference in Bax
                    transcript levels between 129B6 and DBA/2J mice. Thus the higher expression
                    observed in vitro from 129B6–Luc suggested that this
                    polymorphism was, at least in part, responsible for the difference in
                        Bax expression observed in vivo.

The Bax promoter region from the DBA/2J and 129B6 mouse
                            lines was isolated, sequenced, and compared. The nucleotide directly
                            upstream of the translation start site is indicated as −1 in
                            the first exon and numbering of the murine Bax promoter
                            is relative to this position. Depicted are the sequences of 30 bp of the
                            129B6 and DBA/2J promoter regions at positions −499 to
                            −528. A single nucleotide polymorphism (outlined with a
                            dashed box) was found at position −515. The core p53
                            half-site recognition sequence is Pu Pu Pu C A/T A/T G Py Py Py (where
                            Pu, purine; Py, pyramidine) (El-Deiry et
                                al., 1992). The DBA/2J promoter has a perfect consensus
                            sequence (underlined). Other putative transcription factor binding sites
                            are also shown as previously described (Igata et al., 1999).

Figure 4 Expression from 129B6–Luc is higher than
                            DBA/2J–Luc in both immortalized non-neuronal and neuronal
                            cell lines and primary fibroblasts
DBA/2J–Luc or 129B6–Luc were transiently
                            co-transfected with pSV-βgal into NIH 3T3 murine fibroblasts,
                            RGC-5 cells, or primary fibroblasts derived from either DBA/2J mice or
                            FVB mice. The histogram represents the mean Luc levels (in RLU, relative
                            light units) normalized to βgal activity (±S.E.M.)
                            of three to five experiments, with three to six replicates for each
                            condition in each experiment. 129B6–Luc exhibited 1.5-fold
                            the expression of DBA/2J–Luc in NIH 3T3 cells and RGC-5 cells
                                (*P = 3×10−4
                            and
                                **P = 1.71×10−12
                            respectively). In transient transfections of primary fibroblasts from
                            DBA/2J and FVB mice, 129B6–Luc exhibited 2.5- and 2.3-fold
                            the expression, respectively, of DBA/2J–Luc
                            (***P = 0.002 and
                                ****P = 2.82×10−6
                            respectively). These results are consistent with higher levels of
                                Bax mRNA in neurons of 129B6 mice. Cells from 129B6
                            mice were excluded from this analysis because they exhibited poor growth
                            kinetics in primary cultures.

The difference in the level of expression between DBA/2J–Luc and
                    129B6–Luc is not regulated by p53
We first determined if nuclear proteins interacted with the polymorphic site.
                    EMSAs were performed using radiolabelled 129B6 or DBA/2J probes spanning 30 bp,
                    including the polymorphic site (see Figure
                    3), and nuclear extracts isolated from NIH 3T3 cells or retinal tissue.
                    Retinal nuclear extracts were derived from either 129B6 or DBA/2J mice, both
                    yielding the same result. Only data from the 129B6 extract is shown. NIH 3T3 and
                    retinal nuclear extract produced two predominant shifted complexes, Complex 1
                    and Complex 2, compared with lanes with no nuclear extract (Figure 5). Although Complex 2 consisted of multiple bands,
                    these bands behaved similarly in competition assays (data not shown) and were
                    treated as a single complex during analyses. The polymorphism in the DBA/2J
                    promoter was contained within a consensus p53 half-site. Two of these p53
                    half-sites, 0–13 bp apart, are typically required for effective p53
                    binding (El-Deiry et al., 1992). Others
                    have shown, however, that p53 half-sites can mediate expression, which involved
                    p53 binding, by remotely interacting with other cis-elements
                        (Menendez et al., 2007). The change
                    of a T(129B6) to a C(DBA/2J) at the −515 position would putatively
                    increase p53 interactions with the DBA/2J half-site.

Figure 5 Both NIH 3T3 and retinal nuclear extracts produced two shifted
                            complexes in EMSA
A representative PhosphorImager-generated autoradiograph of an EMSA
                            performed with 32P-labelled 129B6 or DBA/2J double-stranded
                            probe (−499 to −528 sequence in Figure 3) is shown. No shifted
                            complexes were formed in the absence of nuclear extract. Nuclear
                            extracts from both fibroblasts and 129B6 retinal tissue (5 μg
                            of total protein each) formed two shifted complexes denoted as Complex 1
                            and Complex 2. Three separate extracts, from each tissue source, are
                            shown.

We initially tested the hypothesis that binding of p53, principally to the DBA/2J
                    polymorphism, may be acting to repress transcription. To examine p53
                    involvement, unlabelled competition EMSA was first performed with a 50-fold
                    molar excess of a concatemer of four p53 half-sites (Figures 6A and 6B). The unlabelled p53 half-site concatemer
                    competed specifically with Complex 1
                        (P = 4.23×10−10).
                    This result was consistent with possible involvement of p53, but importantly
                    indicated that DNA–protein interactions of Complex 1 included the
                    polymorphic region. To test the effects of p53 directly, we transiently
                    transfected DBA/2J–Luc and 129B6–Luc into primary
                    fibroblasts isolated from p53−/− FVB mice, to
                    determine if the differential expression observed between the two promoters was
                    lost in the absence of p53. In p53−/−
                    fibroblasts, 129B6–Luc expression was approx. 1.5-fold higher than
                    DBA/2J–Luc
                    (P = 0.03), and in
                    p53+/+ cells 129B6–Luc expression was twice as high as
                    DBA/2J–Luc expression
                    (P = 0.003, see FVB cells in
                        Figure 4). As a control, we also
                    co-transfected the cells with a plasmid expressing exogenous p53
                    (pC53-SN3). The addition of exogenous p53 did not significantly
                    transactivate or repress either DBA/2J–Luc
                    (P = 0.16, compared with no
                    p53) or 129B6–Luc
                    (P = 0.30) expression (Figure 6C). Conversely, a reporter construct
                    with 13 p53 consensus sites (pG13–Luc) exhibited 8-fold more Luc
                    expression after the addition of exogenous p53 compared with cells without p53
                        (P = 0.0001, Figure 6C). Importantly, differential
                    expression between DBA/2J–Luc and 129B6–Luc was not
                    affected by the presence or absence of p53. In order to confirm these data, we
                    examined if the EMSA-binding pattern was altered in nuclear extracts isolated
                    from p53−/− cells. Extracts from both
                        p53+/+ and p53−/− fibroblasts
                    (with an otherwise identical genetic background) yielded identical EMSA banding
                    patterns, including Complex 1 (data not shown). Lastly, super-shifting either
                    complex with a p53 antibody was unsuccessful (data not shown).

                            possible p53 involvement, unlabelled competition EMSA was performed with
                            a 50-fold molar excess of a concatemer of four p53 half-sites and
                            compared with the DBA/2J and 129B6 unlabelled competitors at a 50-fold
                            molar excess (consisting of the 30 bp highlighted in Figure 3). The unlabelled p53
                            half-site concatemer competed specifically with Complex 1, whereas
                            DBA/2J and 129B6 oligos competed with both Complexes. NC, lane

                            in the presence of no competitor DNA was assigned a value of 100% and

                            co-transfected with pSV-βgal and either pGL-Basic (-p53) or
                                pC53-SN3 (+p53). The 129B6–Luc construct had
                            higher expression than the DBA/2J–Luc construct with or
                            without addition of exogenous p53
                            (P = 0.03 and

                            respectively). Although there was a trend toward an increase in
                            expression from DBA/2J–Luc and 129B6–Luc when
                            co-transfected with human p53, compared with
                                p53−/− cells transfected with a
                            non-expressing control vector, the increase was not statistically
                            significant (DBA/2J,
                            P = 0.16; 129B6,
                                P = 0.30). These
                            results are consistent with other reports showing that p53 does not
                            transactivate the murine Bax promoter (Igata et al., 1999; Schmidt et al., 1999; Thornborrow et al., 2002). The
                            p53-responsive vector, pG13–Luc, exhibited a
                            significant increase in expression with co-transfection of human p53
                                (P = 0.0001),
                            indicating that the exogenous p53 was biologically active in these
                            cells.

The single nucleotide polymorphism affects the binding affinity of nuclear
                    proteins
Because p53 was ruled out as a transcription factor that affected the difference
                    in expression, we determined if the polymorphism affected the binding affinity
                    of other nuclear proteins. Competition EMSA was performed to determine relative
                    binding affinities for the polymorphic site. Complexes formed on radiolabelled
                    DBA/2J or 129B6 probes were competed with increasing fold molar excess of either
                    unlabelled DBA/2J DNA or unlabelled 129B6 DNA. The inhibition constants at half
                    the labelled complex formation (IC50) were calculated using
                    Kaleidagraph software from the values of band density in each lane.
                    The values were plotted and a best-fit curve generated (Figure 7A). For Complex 1, the IC50 value for the
                    DBA/2J radiolabelled probe competed with unlabelled DBA/2J DNA was
                    5.07±0.39 (fold molar excess) and with unlabelled 129B6 DNA was
                    1.04±0.06. The IC50 for the 129B6 radiolabelled probe
                    compared with unlabelled DBA/2J DNA was 8.62±0.35 and compared with
                    unlabelled 129B6 DNA was 2.47±0.16 (Figure 7B). Thus, 4–5-fold more unlabelled DBA/2J DNA,
                    relative to unlabelled 129B6 DNA, was required to inhibit half of the
                    radiolabelled complex from each probe. These results suggested that the
                    protein(s) forming Complex 1 had a higher affinity for the 129B6 site. For
                    Complex 2, the IC50 value of the DBA/2J radiolabelled probe
                    co-competed with DBA/2J unlabelled DNA was 180.53±8.95 and with 129B6
                    unlabelled DNA was 132.63±10.91 (Figure
                        7B). The IC50 for Complex 2 of the 129B6 radiolabelled
                    probe compared with the unlabelled DBA/2J DNA was 198.14±19.45 and
                    compared with unlabelled 129B6 DNA was 128.57±10.85 (Figure 7B). The IC50 ratios of
                    Complex 2 indicated that the protein(s) forming this complex exhibited similar
                    binding affinities for both the DBA/2J and 129B6 DNAs. These data indicated
                    Complex 1 was formed via DNA–protein interactions with the
                    polymorphic site, whereas Complex 2 was probably formed with
                    DNA–protein interactions elsewhere on the 30 bp sequence. To confirm
                    this, we also performed unlabelled competition EMSA with separate regions of the
                    30 bp sequence (Figure 8). Complex 2
                    formation was inhibited most successfully with a unlabelled 10 bp DNA fragment
                    upstream of the polymorphic site, suggesting that this region was principally
                    involved in Complex 2 formation.

                            c.p.m./lane (0.12 pmol) of radiolabelled DBA/2J probe (left panel) or
                            radiolabelled 129B6 probe (right panel) were reacted with either no or 5
                            μg of 129B6 retinal nuclear extract. Complexes were also
                            incubated with no competitor DNA (NC) or increasing molar excess of
                            unlabelled DBA/2J competitor DNA. Increasing molar excess caused
                            inhibition of the formation of radiolabelled Complex 1 and Complex 2
                            compared with lanes with no competitor DNA. Bottom two panels: same
                            probes as the top two panels with increasing amounts of unlabelled 129B6
                            competitor DNA. (B) Graphs plotting fold molar excess of
                            DNA compared with band density of complexed probe obtained from
                            analysing PhosphorImager-generated autoradiographs using ImageQuant v5.2
                            software. Kaleidograph software was then used to generate graphs and
                            calculate IC50 values. The mean (±S.E.M.) complex
                            formed in three separate experiments are shown. The amount of complexed
                            probe in the presence of no competitor DNA was assigned a value of 100%
                            and subsequent competitor lanes are expressed as a percentage of this.
                            As the fold molar excess competitor DNA increases, there is increased
                            inhibition of radiolabelled complex formation. Top panels: radiolabelled
                            DBA/2J probe (left) or radiolabelled 129B6 probe (right) compared with
                            increasing fold molar excess of DBA/2J or 129B6 unlabelled competitor
                            DNA for Complex 1. For Complex 1, the IC50 value of DBA/2J
                            radiolabelled probe (left) co-competed with unlabelled DBA/2J DNA was
                            5.07±0.39 and with unlabelled 129B6 DNA was
                            1.04±0.06. The IC50 for 129B6 radiolabelled probe
                            (right) compared with unlabelled DBA/2J DNA was 8.62±0.35 and
                            compared with unlabelled 129B6 DNA was 2.47±0.16. Approx.
                            4–5-fold more DBA/2J unlabelled DNA relative to unlabelled
                            129B6 DNA was required to inhibit half of the radiolabelled complex.
                            These data suggest that the protein(s) forming Complex 1 have a higher
                            affinity for the 129B6 site. Bottom panels: radiolabelled DBA/2J probe
                            (left) or radiolabelled 129B6 probe (right) versus increasing fold molar
                            excess of DBA/2J or 129B6 unlabelled competitor DNA for Complex 2. The
                                IC50 value of the DBA/2J radiolabelled probe (left)
                            co-competed with DBA/2J unlabelled DNA was 180.53±8.95 and
                            with 129B6 unlabelled DNA was 132.63±10.91. The
                            IC50 for Complex 2 of the 129B6 radiolabelled probe (right)
                            compared with unlabelled DBA/2J DNA was 198.14±19.45 and
                            compared with unlabelled 129B6 DNA was 128.57±10.85. The
                                IC50 ratios of Complex 2 indicate that the protein(s)
                            forming this complex exhibit similar binding affinities for both the
                            DBA/2J and 129B6 DNAs.

                            regions shown. These fragments were used for competition as concatemers
                            of three copies of each 10 bp region. (B) Representative

                            extract. The radiolabelled 129B6 full-length probe was incubated in the
                            presence or absence of unlabelled competitor DNAs. Each competitor DNA
                            was used at a 150-fold molar excess of potential binding sites.
                            Competitor a specifically competed Complex 2, while b competed Complex
                            1, but minimally competed Complex 2. Alternatively, oligo bc efficiently
                            competed Complex 2. These results suggested Complex 2 was formed with
                            interactions upstream of the polymorphic site, but may also involve
                            interactions further downstream of this site.

DISCUSSION
Several neuronal populations require Bax for cell death during
                development. Bax deficiency resulted in an increase in neuronal
                numbers in regions such as the cerebellum, hippocampus and retina (Mosinger Ogilvie et al., 1998; White et al., 1998). Importantly,
                Bax gene dosage was shown to be critical for susceptibility to RGC
                death in the DBA/2J mouse glaucoma model and after ONC (Libby et al., 2005a).

Similarly, we demonstrated that retinal ganglion cell somas of DBA/2J mice
                heterozygous for the mutant Bax allele exhibited resistance to cell
                death in response to an acute crush lesion of the optic nerve, when assayed at 2
                weeks after ONC. Unlike completely Bax-deficient cells, which
                exhibit essentially permanent resistance to optic nerve lesion,
                        Bax+/− cells, which have short-term
                resistance to ONC (at 2 weeks), eventually die over a much longer time frame. A
                distinct cell death phenotype was observed for
                Bax+/− mice on the 129B6 background, however,
                in that these ganglion cells died with similar kinetics to wild-type cells.

The variation in cell death phenotype associated with Bax genotype
                appeared to be related to the relative level of latent Bax mRNA and
                protein in affected cells. Quantitative analysis of Bax transcript
                and protein levels showed that 129B6 neuronal populations (including retina and
                brain) expressed approximately twice the level of gene product than did equivalent
                cells of DBA/2J mice. Importantly, 129B6Bax+/− mice expressed approximately the same amount of Bax mRNA
                and protein as wild-type DBA/2J animals, thus providing one explanation for why
                animals of both these genotypes exhibited essentially normal levels of ganglion cell
                death. Taking the level of Bax expression in these mice as a
                starting point, two important observations are made with respect to the level of
                    Bax and the ability of these neurons to execute apoptosis.
                Lowering Bax expression levels by half from this point, as was
                observed in DBA/2JBax+/− mice, was a sufficient reduction in BAX to make ganglion cells
                substantially resistant to ONC, at least in the short term. Conversely, doubling
                    Bax expression levels from the same point, as was observed in 129B6Bax+/+ mice, had no increased effect on the rate of cell death. This latter
                observation is consistent with earlier reports that transgenic mice overexpressing
                wild-type Bax showed no increase in normal developmental programmed
                cell death (Bernard et al., 1998), and
                underscores a hypothetical concept that cells require a set threshold of
                Bax expression, which allows them to completely commit to the
                apoptotic program once it has been activated. This threshold may also be distinct
                from the levels of other members of the Bcl2 gene family. Both
                lines of mice, regardless of Bax genotype, expressed equivalent
                levels of BclX mRNA and protein, which, at the mRNA level, was also
                in approx. 5–10-fold molar excess. Similarly, preliminary experiments to
                quantify Bim transcripts, which encode a principal BH3-only protein
                involved in ganglion cell death (Näpänkangas et al., 2003; McKernan and Cotter, 2007) also showed no difference between
                strains (data not shown). Thus the correlation between cell death and
                Bax genotype appears to be mediated primarily by the level of
                    Bax expression and not in conjunction with altered levels of
                other members of the Bcl2 gene family.

A caveat to the conclusion that lower Bax expression levels
                influence retinal ganglion cell in DBA/2J mice is that there are probably multiple
                interacting genes that influence the cell death response. These genes could also
                vary between different genetic backgrounds. For example, previously we reported that
                DBA/2J mice were more resistant to ONC than BALB/cByJ mice (Li et al., 2007). The difference in phenotype between the
                strains accounted for approx. 12% of the variance found in the loss of RGCs among
                mice after this procedure. Examination of the levels of Bax
                expression between strains showed that Bax was not the affecting
                allele, which was later attributed to a quantitative trait locus that mapped to
                chromosome 5 (Dietz et al., 2008).
                Interestingly, wild-type C57BL/6J and 129×1/SvJ, which both contribute to
                the genetic make-up of129B6 mice, exhibited a cell death phenotype statistically
                similar to DBA/2J mice. This suggests that influences attributable to different
                genetic background are not dramatically influencing the relationship between
                    Bax expression and cell death we observed in the present study.

Experiments described in the present study establish a link between a single
                nucleotide polymorphism in the Bax promoter with the quantitative
                difference in Bax expression observed between the DBA/2J and 129B6
                mouse lines. In transient transfection experiments, the 129B6 polymorphism roughly
                doubled the transcriptional activity of a Luc reporter gene. It is likely, however,
                that this cis-element is not the only factor affecting
                Bax gene expression quantitatively. Recently, for example, Whitney et al. (2009) described a quantitative
                and hereditary difference in amacrine cell number in the retinas of C57BL/6J and A/J
                mice. This quantitative trait was mapped to a locus on chromosome 7, near
                    Bax, and was associated with a higher level of
                Bax transcripts in A/J mice. Surprisingly, A/J mice carry the
                −515(C) polymorphism, similar to DBA/2J mice, whereas C57BL/6J mice carry
                the −515(T) polymorphism, which is the opposite association of what we
                would predict from our data presented here. Although no in vitro
                transcription studies were conducted by this group, they hypothesized that
                differential transcription of the Bax allele may be due to enhanced
                p53 binding to the A/J allele. Since our studies have excluded p53 binding to this
                region, we predict that differences in genetic background can influence
                Bax transcription both at the level of the
                cis-element polymorphism and the transcriptional machinery
                interacting with it. Overall, our studies, combined with those of Whitney et al. (2009), underscore the
                importance of characterizing the transcription factors interacting with this
                polymorphic site.

Candidates for transcription factors that may interact with this site were examined.
                Although the polymorphism in the DBA/2J Bax promoter creates a
                perfect consensus p53 half-site (El-Deiry et al.,
                    1992), our experiments clearly exclude p53 binding as a critical factor
                for the differential regulation of Bax. We then investigated if the
                affinity of other nuclear proteins was affected by the polymorphism. Our data
                suggested that the polymorphism in the Bax promoter was sufficient
                to cause a difference in binding affinity of nuclear proteins. Specifically, nuclear
                proteins were found to be binding with higher affinity to the 129B6 polymorphic
                site. Therefore, we predicted that an activator or an activation complex was
                interacting more efficiently with the 129B6 promoter, resulting in an increase in
                transcription. The identities of the binding proteins in this region are currently
                being investigated. Interestingly, artificial transcription factors have been
                designed to bind to a p53 half-site contained in the human BAX
                promoter with the intention of selectively up-regulating BAX and
                not other p53 targets (Falke et al., 2003).
                An artificial transcription factor containing five zinc-finger-binding motifs,
                5ZFAV, was able to elicit significant transactivation from a 40 bp section of
                promoter containing the consensus p53 half-site. A caveat to this study, however,
                was that this portion of the promoter also contained three other imperfect p53
                half-sites, which could have affected binding and therefore may not be analogous to
                the mouse polymorphic region.

Alternatively, a search of several transcription-factor-binding-site databases, using
                the consensus 10 bp surrounding the 129B6 polymorphism, identified other potential
                transcription factor-binding sites (Table 1).
                None of the sites was a perfect match. Nevertheless, the putative transcription
                factors identified were activators of transcription, consistent with our prediction
                that Complex 1 is a positive regulator of transcription. These potential
                transcription factors included C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein), FOXI1
                (Forkhead box I1), and E2F1. E2F1 may be the most promising candidate because of the
                role it plays in apoptosis. Mice deficient in E2F1, for example, have excess T-cells
                owing to defects in thymocyte apoptosis, and E2F1 has been shown to activate the
                expression of Apaf-1. Importantly, increased E2F1 activity also
                resulted in the release of cytochrome c (Ginsberg, 2002). In microarrays, E2Fs have also been implicated
                in the up-regulation of members of the Bcl-2 gene family, including
                    Bad and Bak (Ma et al., 2002).

                        with similarity to the polymorphic region
A search of transcription factors that can potentially bind the polymorphic
                        region was conducted using the 10 bp core sequence from the 129B6
                            Bax promoter (AGGTTTGCCT). The databases searched
                        included MatInspector, TESS, TFSEARCH and JASPAR. The sequences for putative
                        transcription-factor-binding sites shown in this Table were chosen based on
                        having the highest sequence similarity. Nucleotides that do not align with
                        the polymorphic site are denoted in lower case, whereas exact matches are in
                        upper case. The letter symbols used for nucleotide sequence are as follows:
                        R = G or A,
                        W = T or A,
                        Y = C or T,
                        S = G or C. EBP-45, enhancer-binding

Although experimentally we have demonstrated that the level of Bax
                expression can profoundly affect cell death, we have only been able to detect this
                phenotype in mice that have been genetically manipulated to have one functional
                    Bax gene. Interestingly, however, a similar phenotype has been
                described in humans. Saxena et al. (2002)
                noted that patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia had a high BCL2/BAX protein
                ratio. Further examination revealed that a single G to an A polymorphism 248 bp
                upstream from the translational start site was present in one copy of the
                    BAX gene of 69% of the patients. This promoter polymorphism
                associated with late-stage disease and resistance to treatment. These investigators
                then demonstrated that this polymorphism was responsible for a 2.6-fold reduction in
                    BAX expression (Moshynska et
                    al., 2005). Although the G(−248)A polymorphism in the human
                    BAX promoter lies outside of the polymorphism we have detected
                in the mouse Bax promoter, these observations validate the concept
                that mutations affecting BAX expression can influence cell death in
                disease. Based on our observations in mice, the same or similar polymorphisms in the
                human BAX gene may also contribute to susceptibility of cells in
                genetically complex neurodegenerative diseases.
