INTRODUCTION
The potential use of stem cells for restoration of function in the CNS (central
nervous system) after injury, or as a result of age-related degenerative and disease
processes, is currently an area of intensive investigation in neurobiology (Cao et al., 2002; Lindvall and Kokaia, 2006; Dimos
et al., 2008). Stem cell-derived neural cell lines that will be most
useful for purposes of implantation include various types of clonally derived cells
that are capable of indefinite replication in tissue culture and differentiation
into neural cells (Gottlieb, 2002).
Approaches for deriving neural cells from mouse ES (embryonic stem) cells are also
applicable to human progenitor cells, and it appears that current tissue culture
methods can be readily perfected to allow the isolation of highly purified
preparations of the major neural cell types. Stem cells are also advantageous for
implantation research because they can be used for the preparation of genetically
engineered cell lines, for which transfection protocols have recently been optimized
(Braam et al., 2008).

Because morphogenic signals co-ordinate major stem cell decisions to regulate the
size, shape and cellular diversity in nervous tissue development (Panchision and McKay, 2002; Krencik and Zhang, 2006; Muotri and Gage, 2006), it is clear that the cellular and
biochemical environment into which such cells are introduced will play a critical
role in determining their survival, migration patterns and expression of
differentiated functions. Proteoglycans and their extracellular matrix ligands (for
reviews, see Sugahara and Mikami, 2007; Zimmermann and Dours-Zimmermann, 2008) are
likely to exert a decisive influence on stem cell behaviour. These macromolecules
would be derived both from the implanted cells themselves and from the recipient
tissue, possibly resulting in reciprocal effects.

Glypican-1 is largely present as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface
heparan sulfate proteoglycan. However, we have previously demonstrated that it
contains a nuclear localization signal, is present in the nuclei of CNS neurons and
is transported to the nuclei of 293, COS-1, and C6 glioma cells, which show changes
in the pattern of glypican nuclear immunoreactivity both during cell division and
correlated with different phases of the cell cycle (Liang et al., 1997). These findings suggest that glypican-1 may be
involved in the regulation of cell division and survival by directly participating
in nuclear processes, possibly by facilitating the transport of growth factors into
the nucleus. Recent studies have also shown that glypican-1 regulates
anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome substrates and cell-cycle progression in brain
endothelial cells (Qiao et al., 2008), and
that glypicans play an essential role in the regulation of morphogen signalling
(e.g. by promoting internalization of Hedgehog; Beckett et al., 2008).

Phosphacan is an mRNA splice variant representing the entire extracellular portion of
a transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, RPTP (receptor protein-tyrosine
phosphatase)-ζ/β, which is a high-affinity ligand of a number
of neural cell-adhesion molecules and of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin-C
(reviewed in Margolis and Margolis, 1997).
Although hyaluronan, the hyaluronan-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and
phosphacan are present in some or all perineuronal nets (Carulli et al., 2007; Galtrey et
al., 2008), the dense extracellular matrix structures that develop around
many neuronal cell bodies late in development and are thought to be involved in
restricting experience-dependent synaptic plasticity in the adult, phosphacan has
also been detected very early in CNS development at extrasynaptic sites prior to
synapse formation (Dino et al., 2006).

Tenascin-C was the first identified member of a highly conserved family of four large
multimodular extracellular matrix glycoproteins found only in vertebrate organisms
(for reviews, see Hsia and Schwarzbauer,
2005; Tucker and Chiquet-Ehrismann,
2009). They have distinctive expression patterns (only tenascin-C and
tenascin-R are present in nervous tissue) and all of the tenascins share the
characteristics of having tightly regulated expression both during development and
throughout the life of an organism, and of modulating cell–matrix
interactions and mediating cell adhesion in a manner that promotes cell motility. We
have previously demonstrated that the fibrinogen-like globe of tenascin-C mediates
its high-affinity interactions with the core proteins of two chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycans that are characteristic of nervous tissue (neurocan and
phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β) and have potent effects on neural cell
adhesion and neurite outgrowth (Milev et al.,
1997). Because proteoglycans and their cell surface or extracellular matrix
ligands can be expected to have major effects on stem cell behaviour, we have
examined the expression of glypican-1, phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β and
tenascin-C by neural stem cells and differentiated neurons and glia derived from
them.

EXPERIMENTAL
Antibodies
Rabbit antisera to phosphacan (Milev et al.,
1994) and glypican-1 (Liang et al.,
1997) have been described previously. Anti-tenascin-C, prepared by
immunizing rabbits with tenascin-C purified from the U-251 MG human glioma cell
line (Bourdon et al., 1985), was
generously provided by Dr Mario Bourdon (La Jolla Institute for Molecular
Medicine). The antisera had been adsorbed against serum proteins, fibronectin
and laminin and found to be tenascin-C specific on ELISA and in immunoblots of
total proteins from 1-day postnatal, 15-day and adult rat brain.

Antibodies to mouse GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein; MAB360),
β-III tubulin (MAB1637) and the O4 oligodendrocyte marker (MAB345)
were all obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA, U.S.A.). Secondary antibodies
(FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG and Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG or IgM) were
obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA, U.S.A.). The MC-480
antibody to SSEA-1 and the Rat-401 antibody to nestin were obtained from the
Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA, U.S.A.).

Cell culture media and other chemicals
DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) with high glucose
(11960-069), MEM (minimal essential medium) non-essential amino acids
(11140-050), MEM sodium pyruvate (11360-070), l-glutamine (25030-081),
penicillin/streptomycin (15140-122) and trypsin/EDTA (25300-054) were all
obtained from Gibco/Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). ES Qualified fetal bovine
serum (100-125) was from Gemini Bio-Products (Woodland, CA, U.S.A.). LIF
(leukaemia inhibitory factor; ESG1107, ESGRO) was obtained from Chemicon.

Culture of mouse ES cells
Mouse ES and EMFI cells were obtained from the Alexandra Joyner laboratory (NYU
Medical Center) and cultured as described by Matise et al. (2000). Mitomycin C-treated primary mouse embryonic
fibroblast (EMFI) feeder cells (Doetschman et
al., 1985) were plated on to dishes in EMFI medium [DMEM containing
0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM
l-glutamine, 15% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 50
μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin]. The following day, W4/129S6 ES cells
(Auerbach et al., 2000) were suspended
in ES cell medium (EMFI medium containing 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mM, and LIF,
1000 units/ml) and plated on the feeder layer. The ES cells (from a stock used
to make knockout mice and thus demonstrably normal) were propagated for only a
limited time (∼1 month) before starting with new frozen stocks to
avoid working with karyotypic variants. After 24 h in culture (65–70%
confluent) the medium was replaced, and after a further 24 h, the cells
(90–95% confluent) were plated on to 10 cm dishes (Nunc; 1-50679)
coated with 0.1% bovine skin gelatin (Sigma; G9391) and maintained in this
manner with a further replating over the following 3 days.

Culture of feeder-independent mouse ES cells
The feeder-free E14Tg2a.4 mouse ES cell line was obtained from the Mutant Mouse
Regional Resource Center (Davis, CA, U.S.A.) and cultured in a manner very
similar to that described above, with some minor differences in medium
composition, trypsinization and gelatin coating of plates (Brennan and Skarnes, 1999; Skarnes, 2000). Differentiation and subsequent steps were performed
exactly as described below for the W4/129S6 cell line.

Neural induction
Neural differentiation of ES cells was performed by the general procedure of
Bain et al. (1998), but using the
slightly simplified EMFI medium described above. ES cells were detached by mild
trypsinization in EMFI medium and placed in suspension culture in dishes
(Corning; 430591) coated with 0.1% agar (Gibco/BRL; M00391B). After 48 h they
were transferred to fresh EMFI medium after gravity sedimentation (10 min in 15
ml conical tubes) and replated in the same dish. Two days later they were
transferred by sedimentation to EMFI medium containing 0.6 μM
all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma; R2625), and the medium was
changed after a further 2 days. (During the 4-day period when cells were
cultured in suspension with retinoic acid, the second day is referred to as day
2+ and the fourth and final day of the retinoic acid treatment as day 4+.) At
days 2+ and 4+, and 9 days after beginning the retinoic acid induction, cells
were seeded on to glass coverslips coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-d-lysine
(molecular mass >300000 Da; Sigma; P1024) in a 24-well plate
(Corning; 3527; 0.5–1×106 cells per well).
Differentiated cells were maintained for up to 2 weeks for
immunocytochemistry.

Immunocytochemistry
Semi-quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy was employed to evaluate
proteoglycan expression, due to its greater resolution (at essentially the
single cell level) compared with biochemical procedures based on total cell
protein, and in view of substantial technical obstacles to accurate
quantification of large proteoglycan core proteins by techniques such as
immunoblotting. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min at
room temperature (25°C) with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. After washing
for 3×5 min with PBS, cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature
with 5% BSA in PBS, and for immunocytochemical detection of intracellular
markers (e.g. tubulin and GFAP) cells were permeabilized by inclusion of 0.2%
Triton X-100 in the BSA blocking solution. Cells were treated overnight at
4°C in a humidified chamber with primary antibodies in BSA blocking
solution, washed for 3×5 min with PBS and treated for 1 h at room
temperature (25°C) with FITC- or Texas Red-conjugated secondary
antibodies in blocking solution. After 3×5 min washes with PBS,
nuclei were stained by treatment for 30 min at room temperature with TO-PRO-3
(Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, 1 μg/ml in PBS), washed for
3×5 min with PBS and the coverslips were mounted on slides using
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). Confocal imaging was
performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope with a Plan-Neofluar ×40
oil immersion objective.

RESULTS
Studies were performed using both the W4/129S6 cell line and a mouse ES cell line
(E14Tg2a.4) that does not require a feeder layer. Examination of proteoglycan and
tenascin-C expressions gave identical results in both the cases (e.g. most results
were obtained with the W4 cells, but those shown in Figures 1 and 3(D)–3(F)
were obtained with the feeder-independent E14T cell line).

Figure 1 Expression of glypican-1, tenascin-C and
phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β in mouse ES cells (day 0) and on
the second and fourth days of retinoic acid treatment during the neural
induction period
The green fluorescence in (A–C,
D–F and
G–J) represents glypican-1,
tenascin-C and phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β respectively. ES
cells and neural stem cells are identified in red by their expression of
SSEA-1 (A, D, G) and nestin
(K, L, M) respectively.
β-III tubulin staining (red) is shown in (C) and
nuclear staining with TO-PRO-3 is blue.

Glypican-1, phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β and tenascin-C were weakly
expressed in the SSEA-positive, nestin-negative ES cells (Figures 1A, 1D and 1G), and on the second day of retinoic acid
treatment, SSEA-1 staining decreased and nestin staining first appears (Figure 1L), but neither tubulin nor GFAP is
detectable. Proteoglycan and tenascin-C staining (Figures 1B, 1E and 1H) has, however, increased in intensity as compared
with the ES cells. On day 4 of the retinoic acid treatment, only a small proportion
of cells still show SSEA-1 staining, whereas almost all are strongly nestin positive
(Figure 1M). There is also significant
proteoglycan and tenascin-C expression in these neural stem cells (Figures 1C, 1F and 1J), as well as the first
appearance of β-tubulin, although GFAP is still absent (Figure 1C). By 1 day after replating
(‘differentiated day 1’ after the retinoic acid neural
induction) most cells are strongly nestin-positive and there is similarly strong
staining of β-tubulin, whereas significant staining of GFAP did not
usually appear until day 4 of differentiation (the next time point examined), at
which time nestin has greatly decreased. The neural induction protocol used in the
present study yielded only a very small proportion of oligodendrocytes expressing
the O4 marker. For the Figures, we selected fields that illustrate the range of
neuronal and glial morphologies observed in our study. Thus, not all neurons or glia
(identified by appropriate differentiation markers) will have the same appearance.

Staining of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 is seen around astroglial and
neuronal cell bodies identified by the presence of GFAP and β-tubulin
(Figures 2A–2C and
2D–2F) and on neuronal processes (Figures 2G–2J).

Figure 2 Expression of glypican-1 by neural cells derived from ES cells
Days after differentiation are indicated on the left, and astrocytes and
neurons are identified by their expression of GFAP and β-III
tubulin. The green fluorescence indicates the presence of glypican-1.

Antibodies to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan phosphacan, which recognizes both
RPTP-ζ/β and its extracellular domain (phosphacan), also
showed staining surrounding astroglial cell bodies and their processes (Figures 3A–3C and 3D–3F),
as well as on β-tubulin-expressing neuronal processes (Figures 3G–3J).

Tenascin-C appears as clumps concentrated on neurons (Figures 4A–4C) and covering neuronal processes connecting
widespread groups of cells (Figures
4D–4F). It is also associated with astrocytes (Figures 4G–4J).

Figure 3 Expression of phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β by neural cells
derived from ES cells
Days after differentiation are indicated on the left, and astrocytes and
neurons are identified by their expression of GFAP and β-III
tubulin. The green fluorescence indicates the presence of
phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β.

Figure 4 Expression of tenascin-C by neural cells derived from ES cells
Days after differentiation are indicated on the left, and neurons and
astrocytes are identified by their expression of β-III tubulin
and GFAP. The green fluorescence indicates the presence of tenascin-C.

Cells were examined at 1, 4, 7, 10 and 14 days post-differentiation, and although
most of the fields selected to show expression of proteoglycans were from 4-day
post-differentiation cultures, there was no clear trend of increased or decreased
proteoglycan expression as a function of time after
differentiation. However, expression of tenascin-C appeared to be greatest early
after differentiation.

DISCUSSION
Most previous studies of glycoconjugates in neural stem/progenitor cells have
concerned glycolipids and glycoproteins, with relatively little information being
available on proteoglycans and associated extracellular matrix molecules (reviewed
by Yanagisawa and Yu, 2007). However,
microarray studies comparing acutely isolated human brain A2B5+
progenitor cells with an unsorted white matter dissociate from which they were
obtained demonstrated a 5–10-fold greater expression of the gene for
phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β in the progenitor cells (Sim et al., 2006). In other studies based on
SDS/PAGE and immunoblotting, mouse neural precursor cells grown as neurospheres have
been reported to secrete phosphacan and aggrecan into the medium, and genes for
aggrecan, neurocan, brevican, phosphacan and tenascin-C could be amplified from
mouse neurospheres by RT–PCR (reverse transcription–PCR; Kabos et al., 2004). Immunocytochemical studies
also indicated that chondroitin sulfate surrounded nestin-positive cells or neural
stem/progenitor cells in the rat ventricular zone of the telencephalon at embryonic
day 14, and the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans neurocan,
phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β and neuroglycan C, were detected in the
ventricular zone (Ida et al., 2006).
Neurospheres formed by cells from the fetal telencephalon also expressed these
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. However, all of these studies have concerned
neurosphere-forming stem and progenitor cells isolated from fetal tissue, which are
known to differ in many significant respects from neural stem cells derived from ES
cells (Shin et al., 2007). These latter
cells, which are derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation mammalian
embryos, are a unique population of pluripotent cells that can differentiate into
the embryonic precursors of all adult tissues. Moreover, most of these studies
examined only gene expression, which may not reflect the actual expression of the
corresponding protein(s).

The glycosaminoglycan chains of cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are
ubiquitous elements of the stem cell ‘niche’ (i.e. the
histologically defined microenvironment for stem cell regulation), and there is
evidence that they play an important role in regulating extrinsic signalling
pathways required for ES cell self-renewal and pluripotency (Nurcombe and Cool, 2007; Sasaki
et al., 2008). Insofar as large changes in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis
and fine structure occur as murine ES cells differentiate to embryoid bodies and
extraembryonic endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007)
or to neural progenitor cells (Johnson et al.,
2007), early developmental alterations in, for example, glypican-1 heparan
sulfate fine structure, may modulate growth-factor binding, and thereby affect
morphogenetic signalling processes critical for neural stem cell proliferation and
differentiation.

Major ligands of glypican-1 in the CNS are the Slit proteins, which regulate axonal
guidance, branching, dendritic development and neural migration, and with which
glypican-1 co-localizes in brain (Liang et al.,
1999; Ronca et al., 2001). In addition
to earlier evidence for the role of cell-surface heparan sulfate in the repulsive
guidance activities of Slit-2 protein, it is known that both Slit-2 and glypican-1
mRNAs are strongly up-regulated and co-expressed in the reactive astrocytes of
injured adult brain, suggesting a possible function of Slit proteins and glypican-1
in the adult CNS (where few axon guidance events occur) as significant components of
the inhibitory environment after injury. It is therefore possible that glypican-1
and Slit proteins, either acting alone or as a complex, are a significant factor in
inhibiting axonal regeneration after spinal cord injury (Zhang et al., 2004; Lau and
Margolis, 2010), a condition for which there has been much interest in
the possible therapeutic use of ES cells.

Studies of neural stem cells in the subependymal zone of adult mouse brain have shown
that the neural stem cell niche functions properly in the absence of tenascin-C,
suggesting that this major extracellular matrix protein does not play a significant
role in adult neurogenesis (Kazanis et al.,
2007). However, recent induction gene trap studies of tenascin-C in neural
stem cells indicate that its functions may be instructive rather than permissive or
redundant, and that its absence leads to only marginal defects that the stem cell
niche can compensate for as a functional, integrative entity (von Holst, 2008). Of the 64 theoretically possible tenascin-C
isoforms that could be generated by alternative splicing, 20 have been described in
neural stem cells maintained as neurospheres, where their expression is
differentially regulated by Pax6 (von Holst et al.,
2007). Although the functional significance of these various
alternatively spliced tenascin-C domains is not yet clear, they may contribute to
the formation of slightly different microenvironments within the neural stem cell
niche (von Holst, 2008). It is also of
interest that the transcript level of tenascin-C increased ∼100-fold
after the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of ES cells to extra-embryonic
endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007).

In the work reported here, we have demonstrated that ES cells differentiated to
neural stem cells and then along neuronal and astroglial pathways produce
chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as well as tenascin-C, a
high-affinity extracellular matrix ligand of phosphacan. In a recent study
demonstrating structural alterations in heparan sulfate during the differentiation
of ES cells to Sox1-expressing neural progenitor cells, their transcription profiles
were also compared by screening total RNA isolated from the cell populations for the
presence of mRNA from a wide range of glycosaminoglycan synthetic enzyme and
proteoglycan core protein genes (Johnson et al.,
2007). Consistent with our results, RT–PCR detected expression
of proteoglycan core proteins in both undifferentiated cells and in those expressing
Sox1 (the earliest known specific marker of neuroectodermal precursors, before their
differentiation into neurons and glia). Therefore even proteoglycans such as
phosphacan that are considered as characteristic of nervous tissue are expressed at
very early developmental stages. It should also be noted in this connection that the
transcript abundance of phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β increased
∼10-fold after the differentiation of ES cells to embryoid bodies, but
was essentially absent when the stem cells were differentiated to extra-embryonic
endoderm (Nairn et al., 2007). Moreover,
recent studies have revealed a novel mechanism of axonal degeneration after spinal
cord injury, involving protein tyrosine phosphatases that can be targeted with small
molecule inhibitors that exert a neuroprotective effect (Nakashima et al., 2008). These results suggest that
phosphacan/RPTP-ζ/β expressed by neural stem cells and neural
cells derived from them may be significant in relation to the potential use of
implanted neural stem cells for the treatment of spinal cord injury. It can be
expected that future studies will clarify the specific neurodevelopmental roles of
these proteoglycans and their associated ligands in stem cell populations, and how
these interactions can be used to advantage in the therapeutic application of neural
stem cells for the treatment of injury, degeneration and aging in the CNS.
