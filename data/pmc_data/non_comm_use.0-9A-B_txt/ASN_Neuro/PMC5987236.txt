can lead to neuronal cell death and irreversible functional deficits.
Myelin is vulnerable to a variety of metabolic, toxic, and autoimmune
insults. In diseases like multiple sclerosis, there is currently no
therapy to stop myelin loss, underscoring the need for neuroprotective
and remyelinating therapies. Noninvasive, robust techniques are also
needed to confirm the effect of such therapies in animal models. This
article describes the generation, characterization, and potential uses
for a myelin basic protein-luciferase (MBP-luci) transgenic mouse
model, in which the firefly luciferase reporter gene is selectively
controlled by the MBP promoter. In vivo
bioluminescence imaging can be used to visualize and quantify
demyelination and remyelination at the transcriptional level,
noninvasively, and in real time. Transgenic mice were assessed in the
cuprizone-induced model of demyelination, and luciferase activity
highly correlated with demyelination and remyelination events as
confirmed by both magnetic resonance imaging and postmortem
histological analysis. Furthermore, MBP-luci mice demonstrated
enhanced luciferase signal and remyelination in the cuprizone model
after treatment with a peroxisome proliferator activated
receptor-delta selective agonist and quetiapine. Imaging sensitivity
was further enhanced by using CycLuc 1, a luciferase substrate, which
has greater blood–brain barrier penetration. We demonstrated the
utility of MBP-luci model in tracking myelin changes in real time and
supporting target and therapeutic validation efforts.

==== Body
Introduction
Oligodendrocytes, the myelin forming cells of the central nervous system (CNS),
belong to a class of glial cells which serve to structurally and
functionally support neurons and their axons throughout mammalian life. Upon
differentiation, oligodendrocytes become postmitotic and wrap axons in a
concentric sheath of compact myelin, which is composed of myelin proteins
and lipids. A single mature oligodendrocyte can myelinate up to 50 axons,
with each extension contributing to an internode segment along the continuum
of that axon (Raff &
Lillien, 1988; Barres & Raff, 1999; Nakahara et al.,
2009; Piaton et al., 2009; Corboy & Miravalle, 2010;
Zhang et al.,
2012; Grade
et al., 2013).

Multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the CNS, is one of the
primary causes of neurological disability in young adults, and the loss of
myelin forming oligodendrocytes at lesions is thought to be a primary
contributor to its pathophysiology. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs),
which are present throughout life, can migrate to regions of injury and
replace lost myelin, including in MS lesions (Adams, 1989; Chang et al., 2000; Decker et al.,
2001). There is evidence for successful remyelination in MS
lesions. However, this process appears to be inefficient and eventually
succumbs to the effects of negative regulators of repair, repeated insult,
and age, thereby creating a niche for drug therapies that can overcome these
barriers. In this way, myelin repair processes can be driven effectively to
protect neurons that would otherwise die (Plemel et al., 2017). Toward this
end, noninvasive techniques are needed to quantitatively assess therapeutic
effects in animal models over time and thereby support the development of
neuroprotective and remyelinating therapies.

CNS myelin is synthesized by differentiated oligodendrocytes and is composed of
various lipids and myelin proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP),
proteolipid protein (PLP), and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG;
Jurevics et al.,
2002). During OPC differentiation, myelin constituents are
expressed sequentially, starting with galactosylceramide and followed by
MBP, PLP, and MOG. MBP, which is located within lipid bilayers, is required
for normal myelin compaction around individual axons and, as such,
represents a marker of oligodendrocyte maturation (Miron et al., 2011). The MBP
promoter contains four widely spaced conserved regulatory elements, M1, M2,
M3, and M4, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 kilobase (kb), which are critical for
regulating the timing of myelination and remyelination events (Farhadi et al.,
2003). In the CNS, the proximal modules M1 and M2 drive
relatively low-level expression in OPCs during CNS development, whereas the
upstream M3 region drives high-level expression in oligodendrocytes
throughout development and in the adult CNS. Moreover, the M3 region is
required for myelin expression during remyelination after a demyelinating
insult.

In this article, we describe the generation, characterization, optimization,
and application of a new transgenic mouse model that uses the MBP promoter
region, spanning M1 through M4, to selectively drive expression of firefly
luciferase (MBP-luci) in myelin forming glial cells. This transgenic model,
when used in conjunction with established bioluminescence imaging (BLI)
techniques, offers a powerful tool for following gene expression changes.
MBP-luci line 171 (spanning the M1–M3 promoter region of MBP) was used to
selectively track oligodendrocyte demyelination and remyelination events
longitudinally in the CNS of living mice. This line was also used to assess
the effect of brain penetrable small molecules on remyelination and myelin
protection in the cuprizone lesion model of demyelination after therapeutic
treatment (initiated after removal of cuprizone diet) with a Sanofi
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-delta (PPAR-δ) selective agonist
(S711) or prophylactic treatment (initiated at the start of cuprizone diet)
with the serotonin or dopamine receptor modulator, quietiapine (QTP).
Finally, signal detection was further enhanced by using the blood–brain
barrier penetrable luciferase substrate, CycLuc 1, in albino mice to improve
imaging sensitivity without the removal of fur.

Materials and Methods
Generation of MBP-Luci Transgenic Mice
Either pGL3-hygro-MBP10k-luci or pGL3-hygro-MBP5k-luci plasmids
(Supplemental Figure 1) were digested with NotI and BamH1 enzymes. A
fragment containing the MBP promoter luciferase and polyadenylation
signal was then gel purified. Transgenic mice were generated by
standard pronuclear injection into cell embryos from FVB, B6C3H, or
C57BL/6 (Jackson Lab) following published protocols (Polites &
Pinkert, 2002).

Figure 1. MBP-luci transgenic line generation and validation steps. (a)
MBP-luci transgene utilized endogenous promoter control
elements that regulate expression in oligodendrocytes. M1
to M3 (5 kb) or M1 to M4 (10 kb) promoter regions were
cloned from a BAC library and then inserted into a firefly
luciferase expression vector. MBP promoter-driven
luciferase expression cassettes were microinjected into
fertilized FVB or B63CH oocytes at the single cell stage
to generate transgenic founder mice. (b) Thirty-five
founder lines were identified via PCR. Six lines
demonstrated detectable luminescence signal upon
subcutaneous injection of luciferin (Supplemental Figure
2), and two lines demonstrated superior signal intensity,
as assessed by in vivo and ex vivo
imaging: Lines 171 (Figure 2) and 121 (Supplemental Figure
3). Line 171 was then bred to homozygosity and tested in
the cuprizone model of de/remyelination (Figure 3).
MBP-luci model signal detection was further enhanced by
backcrossing to albino C57BL/6 and using the CycLuc1
substrate (Figures 4–6).

Transgenic-positive founder mice and their transgenic positive G1
offspring were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of tail
biopsy DNA using primers specific for the firefly luciferase gene (PCR
primers: 5′gaaatgtccgttcggttggcagaagc-3′ and 5′ccaaaaccgtgatggaat
ggaacaaca-3′). All animal work was performed in accordance with
federal guidelines. Three different strains of mice (FVB, B6C3H, and
C57BL/6) were used (Figure 1(a)).

BLI in MBP-Luci Transgenic Mice
Experimental protocols were approved by Sanofi’s institutional animal
care and use committee, and studies were conducted in Sanofi’s
association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care
accredited facility. Whole-animal bioimaging was conducted with the
IVIS in vivo imaging system (Xenogen IVIS-100,
IVIS-lumina, or IVIS spectrum, PerkinElmer, Hopkinton, MA) to screen
MBP-luci lines and compare imaging signals. Unless otherwise stated,
one day before imaging, mouse head fur (between the ears, nose to neck
region) was removed with cream (Nair, Church & Dwight Co., Inc.,
Ewing, NJ) and rinsed. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and
injected subcutaneously with 200 mg/kg D-luciferin salt (PerkinElmer,
Hopkinton, MA) or 15 mg/kg CycLuc 1 sodium salt (Aobious, Gloucester,
MA) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline without calcium chloride
and magnesium chloride. Eight minutes after the substrate injection,
mice were placed in the IVIS imaging chamber stage (maintained at
37°C) and imaged with 1 min exposure every 2 min up
to 25 min. Different substrate concentrations, dosing routes, imaging
exposure times, and other imaging parameters were optimized for the
maximum and consistent bioluminescence signal. Imaging kinetic curves
were obtained for each mouse, and peak imaging value was selected.
Usually five mice were imaged per group. The field of imaging was set
to cover five mice and the medium binning, and the f-stop 1 or 2 was
used. A pseudo color scheme (generated by the living
imaging@ software, Xenogen or PerkinElmer) was used
to visualize the numerical contents of the acquired bioluminescent
signal (superimposed onto contrast, gray-scale photographic pictures
to determine the bioluminescence signal location). To quantify
bioluminescence emission signal, identical regions of interest (ROI)
were positioned to encircle each mouse head region, the imaging signal
was quantitated as average radiance
(photons/s/cm2/steradian), and the imaging signal graphic
output was listed as photon flux (photons/s) for the indicated ROI. As
long as the ROI is kept constant in area and position for a study,
these two units are proportional. Data were normalized to
bioluminescence prior to the initiation of treatment for each
animal.

Ex vivo BLI of isolated organs was performed immediately after euthanasia
of the animals by CO2, 10 min after subcutaneous injection
of luciferin (200 mg/kg). Dissected organs were placed on a black
paper covered with plastic sheet and imaged. Bioluminescent signals
usually remained detectable within 10 to 20 min after dissection.

Tissue Preparation and Histological Staining
At indicated time points, animals were euthanized with CO2 and
perfused with phosphate-buffered saline via the left cardiac
ventricle. The brains were dissected, fixed in 10% neutral formalin
for 48 hr, and then transferred into 70% ethanol for embedding,
sectioning, and staining. Brains were sectioned coronally between
bregma 0.74 and bregma 1.0. Then 5-µm serial paraffin sections were
made such that each slide had two sections with 30 µm difference
between the two sections to capture the corpus callosum at different
levels.

Sections were deparaffinized, stained with luxol fast blue (LFB), and
counterstained with nuclear fast red. Slides were scanned using a
Leica scanner (Aperio XT, Buffalo Grove, IL). Images from at least
eight sections were collected, and quantitative image analysis was
performed using Definiens Tissue Studio software (Definiens, Munich,
Germany).

Cuprizone Mouse Model of Demyelination and Remyelination
The cuprizone lesion model was used as described earlier (Jurevics et al.,
2002; Miron et al., 2011) to induce demyelination and follow
remyelination events in the corpus callosum region enriched with
oligodendrocytes. In all studies, 8- to 10-week-old female and male
homozygous MBP-luci transgenic mice were used unless otherwise
specified. Demyelination was induced by feeding a diet containing 0.2%
cuprizone (bis-cyclohexanone oxaldihydrazone; Sigma-Aldrich Inc., St.
Louis, MO) for 4 or 5 weeks. Thereafter, mice were fed a normal powder
diet for another week for remyelination studies. The 0.2% cuprizone
diet was freshly mixed with grounded powder of normal rodent chow. The
control mice also received freshly grounded powder of normal rodent
chow. The cuprizone or normal diet was changed twice per week. Food
and water were available ad libitum, and mice were weighed weekly.

Compound Profiling
MBP-luci B6C3H line 171 (both heterozygous and homozygous) was used to
assess the effect of small molecule modulators of two distinct
signaling pathways: PPAR-δ agonist (S711) and the well-characterized
serotonin or dopamine receptor antagonist QTP.

For the PPAR-δ agonist study, 8-week-old homozygous mice
(n = 12 per group) were placed on a diet
containing 0.2% cuprizone for 26 days and then given normal diet to
allow for endogenous remyelination. After removal of the cuprizone
diet, mice were orally dosed, twice daily, with either vehicle (0.6%
carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt and 0.5% Tween 80) or S711 (30
mg/kg; designed and synthesized at Sanofi) for 8 days and imaged at
different time points. Data were normalized to pretreatment (Week 0)
baseline signals.

For the QTP study, 8-week-old homozygous mice were placed on a diet
containing 0.2% cuprizone and in parallel, orally dosed, once daily,
with vehicle (water) or QTP (10 mg/kg) for 5 weeks and imaged weekly.
For both PPAR-δ and QTP studies, the same experimental design was
performed with line 171 heterozygous mice and generated similar
results (data not shown).

Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements for the cuprizone model
were performed at the 4-week time point using a 7T preclinical MRI
scanner (Biospin, Bruker, Billerica, MA) with a 72-mm volume coil
(Bruker, Billerica, MA) and a 10-mm quadrature surface coil (Bruker,
Billerca, MA) served as the receiver. Multislice multi-echo
T2-weighted (T2W) images were acquired using a rapid acquisition with
relaxation enhancement sequence (TR/TE = 2500 ms/10 ms, 8 echoes, echo
spacing = 10 ms, number of excitations = 2), and T2 maps were
calculated using a single exponential decay. To calculate
magnetization transfer (MT) ratio (MTR) maps, fast low angle shot
(FLASH) images (TR/TE = 70 ms/6 ms, 10° flip angle, number of
excitations = 48) were acquired both with and without an MT saturation
pulse (Gaussian shaped, 10.25 ms long, 10 µT peak power, 6 kHz
offset). MTR and T2W images were acquired with 0.75-mm slice thickness
(six coronal slices), 25-mm field-of-view, and matrix size of
256 × 256. For data analysis, an ROI was drawn around the visible
corpus callosum structure across the six coronal slices in the MTR
maps to calculate the corpus callosum area and the MTR values. The
same ROIs were overlaid on the T2 maps to calculate the T2 values. The
individual slices from each animal were grouped together for
statistical comparisons between the two groups.

Statistical Analysis
Each of the measurements in Figures 2(c), 5(c), and
6 is
compared between two treatment groups using two-sample
t tests. For the comparison of BLI signals
(Figure
4(b)) in the brain and intestines for two types of
substrates, two-sample t tests were performed at each
of the study time points and corrected for multiple comparisons using
the Holm-Sidak method. A two-way analysis of variance model was
applied to the data in Figures 3 and 5(a) with
random effect nested in mouse, using treatment, time (categorized),
and their interactions as covariates. The comparisons among different
treatment groups at each time point was evaluated with
p value adjusted by Holm–Bonferroni method. For
the correlation between BLI at each time point and each of the
histology and MRI parameters, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient
method was used (Figure 5(e) and Supplemental Table 2). Significance is
indicated in the figures by asterisks
(*.01 < p < .05,
**.001 < p < .01,
***p < .001). All two-sample t
tests were performed with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software,
Inc., La Jolla, CA). All other analysis was performed with R version
3.4.1.

Results
Generation of MBP-Luci Mouse Lines and Analysis of Differential
Expression
To study myelin dynamics in vivo by means of a
noninvasive method, we established mouse MBP reporter lines. MBP
promoter elements M1 through M4 have been described to regulate
different aspects of OPC differentiation, myelin synthesis, and
structure (Farhadi
et al., 2003). Upon cloning of M1 to M3 or M1 to M4
promoters from the BAC library, a 5 kb or 10 kb promoter was inserted
into a firefly luciferase expression vector. Then MBP promoter-driven
luciferase expression cassettes were used for microinjection into
fertilized oocytes to generate transgenic founder mice, as described
in Material and Methods section, and 35 founders were identified by
means of PCR (Figure
1(a)). Out of these, six lines showed positive
luminescence signal upon subcutaneous injection of luciferin, and two
lines were selected for their high signal intensity when analyzed ex
vivo in brain white matter sections. Lines labeled as 121 (MBP
promoter M1–M4) and 171 (MBP promoter M1–M3) were further analyzed in
studies with the cuprizone animal model of de/remyelination. Based on
robust reporter gene expression, line 171 was then selected for the
remainder of studies described in this report. Following several trial
iterations for luciferin dosing and imaging optimization, line 171 was
backcrossed to the albino C57BL/6 strain for additional
experimentation including MRI imaging validation (Figure 1(b)).

As expected, homozygous mice from the founder B6C3H line 171 showed over
twofold stronger luminescence signal as compared with heterozygous
mice (Figure
2(a)) and were used for subsequent studies, including
backcrossing into a C57BL/6 albino strain. As illustrated in Figure 2(b;
coronal section of homozygous mouse), in the adult mouse brain, the
highest luciferase signal intensity corresponded to deep white matter
tracts which are enriched with myelin lipids and myelin proteins. Line
121 (FVS strain) in vivo and ex vivo imaging also
confirmed that the corpus callosum region in the brain had the highest
bioluminescence signal (Supplemental Figure 3).

Figure 2. MBP-luci line 171 B6C3H validation. (a) In
vivo imaging of a representative wild-type
B6C3H mouse (WT; no transgene; left side of panel) showing
background bioluminescence in the cranium region of
interest (ROI) that measured 2.5 × 103 photon
counts per second (photons/s). A representative
heterozygous MBP-luci mouse (right side of panel) measured
bioluminescence in the ROI at 1.0 × 104
photons/s and homozygous MBP-luci mouse (center panel)
measured at 2.7 × 104 photons/s with homozygous
mice showing >twofold increase in the signal intensity
as compared with heterozygotes. Similar results were seen
in >100 mice, and this method was used to confirm
homozygosity. (b) Serial coronal sections of whole brains
assessed ex vivo for brain subregion transgene activity
showed strongest bioluminescence (red and yellow pixels)
in the corpus callosum, a region enriched with
oligodendrocytes. (c) LFB densitometry was performed on
sagittal sections of the corpus callosum. Homozygous mice
showed comparable demyelination as wild-type C57BL/6 mice
(similar decrease in % total positive) after 4 weeks on
the cuprizone diet (∼60% decrease in % total positive), as
determined by quantitative morphometric analysis.
Heterozygous mice were more resistant to the cuprizone
diet (∼20% decrease in % total positive). Statistically
significant differences using two-tailed
t test analysis are indicated on
the plot.

Figure 3. A PPAR-δ agonist, S711, and QTP separately enhanced
luciferase activity in the cuprizone model. (a)
Eight-week-old MBP-luci mice (line 171, homozygous, B6C3H
strain; Day 0) were placed on a 0.2% cuprizone diet for 4
weeks to cause demyelination, which resulted in an 80%
decrease in relative luciferase imaging signal at Day 26
compared with the normal food (NF) group. On Day 26, the
normal food diet was resumed to allow for spontaneous
remyelination, and mice were dosed orally, twice daily,
with vehicle (0.6% carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt and
0.5% Tween 80) or S711 (30 mg/kg) for 8 days and imaged at
the indicated time points. At Day 36, relative luciferase
signal increased for the cuprizone group treated with S711
(Cup + S711) as compared with the cuprizone group treated
with vehicle (Cup + Veh; two-way analysis of variance
model with multiple measurement adjustment
*p = .015). (b) At Day 0,
homozygous MBP-luci mice were fed a diet of 0.2% cuprizone
for 5 weeks and, in parallel, dosed orally, once daily,
with QTP (10 mg/kg; Cup + QTP) or vehicle (Cup + Veh).
There is a trend of QTP (Cup + QTP) protection against
cuprizone-induced loss of luciferase signal compared with
the vehicle group (Cup + Veh; two-way analysis of variance
model with multiple measurement adjustment,
p = .15 for Day 21 and
p = .61 for Day 35). Data were
normalized to Day 0 baseline signals for each mouse.

During demyelination, such as that caused by the consumption of
cuprizone, a copper chelator mixed in the diet, a decrease in
luciferase signaling was predicted. Although in wild-type C57BL/6
mice, cuprizone-mediated demyelination is easily detectable in areas
of high myelin content, including the corpus callosum (Lindner et al.,
2008; Mangiardi et al., 2011), strain differences have been
reported, including findings that certain strains do not respond to
cuprizone as well as the most extensively characterized C57BL/6 strain
(Elsworth
& Howell, 1973; Yu et al., 2017). Because
no brain imaging positive transgenic C57BL/6 strain founder could be
generated, the B6C3H strain line 171 had to be tested for suitability
for use in cuprizone-mediated demyelination experiments. Line 171 was
responsive to detecting myelin changes in the cuprizone model showing
levels of demyelination in the corpus callosum (sagittal section)
comparable to that detected in C57BL/6 strain (30–60% demyelination),
as determined by densitometry of LFB staining on sagittal sections of
the corpus callosum (Figure 2(c)). Demyelination in homozygous B6C3H line 171
was significantly higher than in heterozygous mice of the same strain
and comparable to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. As such, homozygous B6C3H
line 171 mice were used for all subsequent studies, including
backcrossing into a C57BL/6 albino strain for MRI imaging studies.

Longitudinal, Noninvasive Tracking of Myelin Changes During
Demyelination and Remyelination Using the MBP-Luci Mice
MBP-luci line 171 was assessed for the ability to detect changes in
myelin content in vivo upon demyelination and
remyelination in the cuprizone model, based on the intensity of
luciferase signal. In addition, the effect on remyelination and
protection of myelin was assessed in this model using two
pharmacological agents that modulate signaling pathways known to
affect oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination, namely a PPAR-δ
selective agonist, S711, and the serotonin or dopamine receptor
modulator, QTP (Iwashita et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2012).

Homozygous mice were fed a cuprizone diet (0.2% in chow) for 26 days to
induce demyelination, and bioluminescence signal was measured in
comparison to animals on a normal diet (Figure 3(a)). A significant
reduction in luciferase activity was observed in mice on the cuprizone
diet during the demyelination phase (Day 0–Day 26), which was
attenuated with S711 treatment by Day 29 (30 mg/kg, twice daily for 8
days) when compared with vehicle. S711 treatment group had a greater
variance compared with vehicle group for all days up to Day 36. S711
treatment effect was statistically significant at the last time point
Day 36 (p = .0153, S711 vs. veh). This same PPAR-δ
agonist S711 stimulated MBP protein expression after 7 days exposure
to cultured rat OPCs in a concentration dependent manner (novel
finding; Supplemental Figure 4).

luciferase signal detection. (a) Cartoon depicting the

substrates. (b) Comparison of CycLuc1 (15 mg/kg) and
D-luciferin (200 mg/kg) substrate imaging with albino
C57BL/6 MBP-luci homozygous mice (n = 3
per group) without shaving. In the brain, CycLuc1 showed
approximately a fivefold increase in signal intensity
compared with D-luciferin over a 26-min period (multiple
t test showed statistically
significant difference between the 3-min and 60-min time
window with p value ranging from
.0001 < p < .01). D-luciferin
initially showed approximately a twofold signal increase
compared with CycLuc1 in the intestines (multiple
t test showed statistically
significant difference at the 1- and 3-min time points
with p values from
.001 < p < .01) but the
levels evened out by 5 min (no significant difference).
For all groups, by 80 min, the signal intensity rapidly
decreased. (c) Representative image from the 20-min time
point showed approximately a fivefold increase in signal
intensity in the brain with CycLuc1 compared with
D-luciferin. D-luciferin showed approximately a twofold
signal increase compared with CycLuc1 in the
intestines.

In addition, administration of QTP (10 mg/kg, once daily), shown to
protect and induce OPC maturation in rodents (Bi et al., 2012), prevented
cuprizone-induced demyelination, as indicated by an increasing
luciferase signal trend at Day 21 and Day 35 shown in Figure
3(b).

Optimization of Luciferase Signal in C57BL/6 Albino Strain and
Measurement of Demyelination in the Cuprizone Model
Upon confirmation of the utility of the MBP-luci mouse for measuring
changes in myelin content and as a part of the model optimization, the
B6CH3 line was back-crossed onto the C57BL/6 albino strain for
homozygous on Tyrc-2J. Their skin, hair, and eye color are
the same as the albino strain (no pigment), so we could avoid black
fur signal interference and the need for shaving before imaging. Also,
a different luciferase substrate, CycLuc1 sodium salt (Evans et al.,
2014) was compared with D-luciferin for signal strength.
As shown in Figure
4, CycLuc1 required much lower doses than D-luciferin
(15 mg/kg vs. 200 mg/kg) because of its superior brain and cellular
penetrability (Adams & Miller, 2014). CycLuc1 resulted in a
significantly stronger signal in the brain, which was detected in less
than 5 min after administration and was maintained at high levels
after 15 min, reaching approximately five times the intensity of
D-luciferin at 20 min post injection (Figure 4(b)). Multiple
t test showed statistically significant
difference (.0001 < p < .01) between the 3 min
and 60 min time window.

For line 171 mice, in addition to the brain, luciferase signal was also
detected in the intestines (Figure 4), and the signal was
stronger using D-luciferase as compared with CycLuc1 as a substrate.
These findings suggest differential substrate bioprocessing, tissue
distribution, or metabolic elimination. Consequently, biodistribution
and cellular uptake differences can have a significant impact on
signal intensity as demonstrated previously with radioiodine labeled
D-luciferin (Lee
et al., 2003) and 14C-D-luciferin pharmacokinetic
studies, which detected limited substrate concentrations in the brain,
bone, and muscle (Berger et al., 2008). Signal decay was detected after 70
min of dosing reaching baseline levels by 100 min (Figure
4(b)).

We next tested the stronger signal detected with CycLuc1 in the MBP-luci
C57BL/6 albino mouse line in demyelination conditions in the cuprizone
model. There was a dramatic decrease in luciferase activity in the
brain of curpizone-demyelinated mice by Day 7, which was maintained at
low levels after 28 days on the cuprizone diet
(p < .0001 for all time points) and showed a trend
toward recovery by 35 days (Figure 5(a) and (b)).
Cuprizone-fed mice showed demyelination in the corpus callosum as
determined by LFB staining and quantification by densitometry (Figure 5(c) and
(d)). In addition, correlation analysis of BLI signal (at
all time points) with histology (LFB at Day 35) showed statistically
significant positive correlations (Figure 5(e)). Among all
imaging time points, Day 21 BLI signal and Day 35 LFB data had the
strongest correlation (also observed in Supplemental Table 2), which
is consistent with the notion that the BLI signal decrease should
precede LFB myelin staining measurement.

model. Mice were maintained on a 0.2% cuprizone diet for
35 days. (a) Luciferase bioimaging signal is shown for the
normal food (NF, n = 12) and cuprizone
(Cup, n = 12) diet groups up to 35 days.
There was a significant decrease in luciferase activity in
the brain after 7 days on the cuprizone diet (∼80%
reduction), similar to line B6C3H. Two-way analysis of
variance showed a statistically significant difference
between NF and Cup groups for all time points after Day 0
(***p < .0001). A trend toward
increasing luciferase signal intensity occurred after Day
7. Imaging signal was normalized to Day 0. (b)

demyelination in the cuprizone diet group

correlation coefficient and corresponding
p values are indicated in the
shaded boxes.

In addition to histological confirmation of demyelination detected by
reduced luciferase signal intensity in MBP-luci mice exposed to
cuprizone, the level of myelin loss was measured by MRI in serial
coronal sections of the mouse brain, thereby analyzing different
regions of the corpus callosum (rostral to caudal). Figure 6(a)
shows gray scale MTR images highlighting the corpus callosum as an ROI
for measurement and comparison between control diet versus cuprizone
diet (4 weeks) using MTR (full color scale, Figure 6(c)) and T2W MRI
(Figure
6(e)). The corpus callosum ROI and MRI parameters from
the MTR and T2 maps were quantified (Figure 6(b), (d), and (f),
respectively). Each data point indicates the average of the measured
parameter across all slices in the same animal. The ROI area (Figure 6(b))
and MTR (Figure 6(c)
and (d)) showed a significant decrease
(.01 < p < .05) in the cuprizone-fed mice
compared with the normal diet mice. T2 showed a significant increase
(p < .001) in signal (Figure 6(e) and (f)) in the
cuprizone-fed mice compared with the normal diet mice. Furthermore, we
conducted correlation analysis of BLI data with LFB and MRI parameters
(Supplemental Table 2, which shows a separate study than Figure 5). BLI
showed a strong correlation with histology LFB staining, corpus
callosum area, and T2 MRI signal but not with MTR.

Discussion
This article details the generation, characterization, optimization, and
potential application of a new MBP-luci mouse model to test remyelination
compounds, where the M1 to M4 promoter regions of the MBP gene drive
expression of a luciferase reporter in the CNS. Luciferase activity in the
brain was highly correlated with demyelination and remyelination events, as
confirmed by both MRI in living mice and postmortem histological analysis
with LFB staining of tissue sections. Transgenic mice were used to confirm
enhanced remyelination in the cuprizone model after therapeutic treatment
with a Sanofi PPAR-δ selective agonist, S711, a small molecule that also
stimulated rat OPC differentiation in vitro in a
concentration dependent manner (Supplemental Figure 4). Previous reports
demonstrate PPAR-δ expression in oligodendrocytes and agonist-driven
differentiation in vitro (Granneman et al., 1998; Saluja et al.,
2001). Importantly, clinical improvement and neuroprotective
effects have been linked to PPAR-δ agonist induced effects in a MOG
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (MOG35–55) model of MS
(Polak et al.,
2005). In this study, mice were dosed with GW0742
(GlaxoSmithKline) after disease onset, and therapeutic efficacy was linked
to both a reduction in astrocytic and microglial inflammatory activation and
increased expression of myelin genes in the CNS. The team went on to confirm
that the neuroprotective effects were mediated through activation of PPAR-δ
and, in oligodendrocytes, may involve modulation of the BMP pathway (Simonini et al.,
2010). Together with the S711 findings, this suggests that
different PPAR-δ chemical series can stimulate oligodendrocyte
differentiation and myelin expression. In addition, MBP-luci mice confirmed
a protective effect of QTP, with dosing initiated after 4 weeks of exposure
to the cuprizone diet consistent to literature reports of myelin protection
(Bi et al.,
2012; Zhang
et al., 2012).

Measuring myelin content in the cuprizone model of de/remyelination has been
traditionally performed by histological means, utilizing global lipid
staining methods including LFB or Black and Gold (Matsushima & Morell, 2001).
Alternatively, immunostaining for myelin proteins (MBP, PLP, and MOG) has
also been widely reported (Stidworthy et al., 2003; Wergeland et al.,
2011). Subsequent digitalization of stained tissue sections and
densitometry quantification with specialized software renders a
semi-quantitative analysis of demyelination and remyelination. However,
analysis of tissue staining for lipid content or immuno-detection of
specific myelin proteins as a measure of myelin changes and their
consequences in physiology and pathology is known to be highly variable in
commonly used models, including the cuprizone model. In addition to strain
differences, there are age, sex, and tissue region differences that are both
time and labor intensive when assessing by histological means. Moreover,
histology requires postmortem sampling, thereby disqualifying each animal to
serve as its own longitudinal control. By contrast, the MBP-luci model
allows for the real-time assessment of changes that occur in individual
animals during dynamic events, such as myelin loss and repair in the
cuprizone model. In depth analysis of the extent of demyelination of
cuprizone model at both histological and MBP gene expression level would be
ideal for studying the underlying pathophysiological events as well as
cellular and molecular changes induced by the loss of myelin.

Identifying reliable biochemical or translational biomarkers for
neuroprotective and myelin repair therapies has proven elusive, which has
resulted in development and implementation of new imaging technologies as
the most suitable methodology to determine myelin content and changes,
particularly in the cuprizone model of MS (Silvestroff et al., 2010; Tagge et al.,
2016). Imaging measurements of brain volume and myelin content
in live rodents present the challenge of low sensitivity to focus on
specific brain or spinal cord regions where demyelination might be more
pronounced. In this context, creating a reporter gene model suitable for
longitudinal analysis of myelin changes in experimental models should
provide an invaluable imaging tool for the identification and evaluation of
agents capable of enhancing or accelerating myelin repair in drug discovery
settings, especially in a high-throughput and noninvasive manner to enable
compound screening.

In the initial design of the MBP-luci model and toward the visualization of
dynamic myelin changes, we considered a fluorescent MBP model, including the
use of green florescent protein; however, the poor signal-to-background
ratio due to tissue auto-fluorescence made this less attractive than the
bioluminescence-based model. We also considered MRI and other translational
imaging modalities; however, the low throughput and lack of cell target
specificity was prohibitive. Despite that, a subset of MBP-luci mice were
used in MRI validation studies. T2 and MTR values detected cuprizone-induced
demyelination effects (Figure 6), which is consistent with published literature
(Fjær et al.,
2013; Guglielmetti et al., 2016; Tagge et al., 2016). Although T2
showed a strong correlation with the BLI data, MTR did not show the same
relationship (Supplemental Table 2). One possible explanation is that our
ROI analysis method involved the selection of the entire corpus callosum
structure (from the rostral to the caudal sections) while previous studies
selected subregions of the corpus callosum (Fjær et al., 2013; Guglielmetti et al.,
2016; Tagge
et al., 2016). Moreover, the spatial difference of MTR across
the corpus callosum has been clearly demonstrated (Tagge et al., 2016), which may
have contributed to our limited MTR dynamic window. This disparity may also
be related to differences in the mouse strain or background and cuprizone
exposure, although larger sample numbers are needed to clarify.

In the neuro-bioimaging field, transgenic reporter gene models allow for the
noninvasive visualization and longitudinal evaluation of cellular processes
including neurogenesis (DCX-luc, doublecortin promoter-driven luciferase
model; Couillard-Despres
et al., 2008; Fricke et al., 2017) and
astrogliosis (GFP-luc, glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter-driven
luciferase model; Zhu
et al., 2004; Ho et al., 2007; Biesmans et al.,
2015) in live mice (Contag et al., 1998; Contag & Ross,
2002). The MBP-luci model further extends this capacity to
monitor myelination events and allows for a combinatorial approach that is
expected to further enhance the ability to measure biological changes in
real time.

MBP promoter regions have been well characterized using different strategies,
including through the random integration of bacterial LacZ gene (Foran & Peterson,
1992; Gow
et al., 1992) and the targeted integration into the
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus (Farhadi et al., 2003). The
MBP-luci transgenic model was generated through traditional pronuclear
injection and as such, the bioluminescence reporters were randomly
integrated into the genome. Importantly, several factors can affect
transgene expression, including integration locus, copy number, codon usage,
mRNA, and protein half-life. However, the expression comparison of
endogenous MBP gene and reporter gene lacZ has been analyzed and shown to be
well correlated (Gow
et al., 1992) and consistent with this finding. The data
currently presented suggest that the luciferase reporter gene from MBP-luci
mice are similarly well correlated and useful for detecting and tracking
dynamic changes in myelin paralleling to endogenous MBP expression
(Supplemental Figure 3).

In terms of imaging sensitivity, various luciferase reporter genes have
demonstrated superior utility for use in brain imaging, including studying
cellular and genetic mechanisms, tracking pathophysiological dynamic process
in disease models, and selecting therapeutic candidates (Rettig et al.,
2006; Aswendt et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2017). After the
initial characterization and validation of the MBP-luci model (Cao et al., 2011;
Cao et al.,
2014), we took advantage of both brain and intestinal
luciferase expression from line 171 to normalize relative bioluminescence
signals and measure intestinal cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation
with caged luciferin (Cao, Adler, & Ying, 2011). Our efforts to improve model
sensitivity included backcrossing the B6C3H mice to the C57BL/6 albino
strain and using the newer brain penetrable substrate CycLuc1 (Cao et al.,
2016). These efforts resulted in the capacity to image 50 to 100 mice
per compound profiling study, thereby improving throughput, which is
critical to screening research for drug discovery.

Overall, the primary benefit of the MBP-luci model over other bioimaging
solutions is that it enables the visualization of demyelinating and
remyelinating events in live mice noninvasively, over time with each animal
serving as its own control and with extremely high signal-to-background
ratio for semiquantitative analysis. This allows for ongoing assessment of
therapeutic effects and biological variability including age, sex, and
disease states. This longitudinal tool is anticipated to significantly
reduce the resource and manpower demands associated with labor intensive
chronic animal studies and postmortem histochemical or gene expression
analyses and provide a sensitive in vivo approach for
targeting and therapeutic validation and prioritization.
