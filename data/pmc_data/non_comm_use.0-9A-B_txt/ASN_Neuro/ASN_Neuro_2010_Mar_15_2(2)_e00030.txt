                    animals, but the pathophysiology of diabetes in the central nervous system is
                    poorly understood. Because a high glucose level disrupts gap junctional
                    communication in various cell types and astrocytes are extensively coupled by
                    gap junctions to form large syncytia, the influence of experimental diabetes on
                    gap junction channel-mediated dye transfer was assessed in astrocytes in tissue
                    culture and in brain slices from diabetic rats. Astrocytes grown in
                    15–25 mmol/l glucose had a slow-onset, poorly reversible decrement in
                    gap junctional communication compared with those grown in 5.5 mmol/l glucose.
                    Astrocytes in brain slices from adult STZ (streptozotocin)-treated rats at
                    20–24 weeks after the onset of diabetes also exhibited reduced dye
                    transfer. In cultured astrocytes grown in high glucose, increased oxidative
                    stress preceded the decrement in dye transfer by several days, and gap
                    junctional impairment was prevented, but not rescued, after its manifestation by
                    compounds that can block or reduce oxidative stress. In sharp contrast with
                    these findings, chaperone molecules known to facilitate protein folding could
                    prevent and rescue gap junctional impairment, even in the presence of elevated
                    glucose level and oxidative stress. Immunostaining of Cx (connexin) 43 and 30,
                    but not Cx26, was altered by growth in high glucose. Disruption of astrocytic
                    trafficking of metabolites and signalling molecules may alter interactions among
                    astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells and contribute to changes in brain
                    function in diabetes. Involvement of the microvasculature may contribute to
                    diabetic complications in the brain, the cardiovascular system and other
                organs.

INTRODUCTION
Many diverse, progressive and severe complications of diabetes are well established
                and are linked to chronically high glucose levels in conjunction with insulin
                deficiency (Type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (Type 2 diabetes). The complex,
                multifactorial pathobiology of diabetes (Brownlee,
                    2005) includes non-specific glycation reactions of glucose, increased
                sorbitol production and osmotic stress, oxidative stress due to generation of ROS
                (reactive oxygen species)/RNS (reactive nitrogen species), depletion of endogenous
                antioxidants, enhanced lipid peroxidation, metabolic changes, altered hormonal
                responses, cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, poor wound healing, and cataract
                formation. Overall, the impact of diabetes on the central nervous system is
                generally considered to be mild or modest compared with involvement of peripheral
                organs and peripheral neuropathies (Little et al.,
                    2007), which have severe consequences for both the quality and duration
                of life of diabetic patients.

Diabetes does, however, affect the brain, altering blood flow, blood–brain
                barrier integrity, brain metabolism and neurotransmitters, and cognitive function in
                diabetic patients and in animal models, but these findings are sometimes
                contradictory due, in part, to differences in duration, severity and control of the
                disease and to methodological issues (McCall,
                1992, 2004, 2005; Mooradian, 1997;
                    Allen et al., 2004; Sima et al., 2004; Biessels and
                    Gispen, 2005; Huber et al., 2006;
                    Kamal et al., 2006; Brands et al., 2007; DCCT/EDIC,
                    2007; Kodl and Seaquist, 2008;
                    Manschot et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2008). Specific brain functions
                are measurably impaired in diabetic patients, including increased latencies of
                visual and auditory evoked potentials (Buller et
                    al., 1988; Di Mario et al., 1995;
                    Díaz de León-Morales et
                    al., 2005) and hearing deficits (Tay et
                    al., 1995; Frisina et al., 2006;
                    Vaughan et al., 2006, 2007), all with unidentified aetiologies.
                Alloxan- and STZ (streptozotocin)-treated diabetic rats have abnormal visual and
                auditory evoked potentials (Buller et al.,
                1986; Rubini et al., 1992; Biessels et al., 1999; Manschot et al., 2003), impaired long-term potentiation and
                facilitated long-term depression in hippocampal neurons, and abnormal water maze
                learning skills (Biessels et al., 1998, Kamal et al., 1999, 2006; Biessels et al.,
                2005). Together, these findings suggest that subtle or sub-clinical
                functional disturbances in diabetic brain may be more widespread than generally
                recognized and may affect auditory, visual and other sensory processing pathways, as
                well as cognitive capability.

Our interest in the involvement of astrocytes in diabetic complications of the
                central nervous system arose from reports of impaired gap junctional communication
                in hyperglycaemic vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cells and retinal pericytes
                    (Inoguchi et al., 1995; Stalmans and Himpens, 1997; Kuroki et al., 1998; Oku et al., 2001; Sato et al.,
                    2002; Li et al., 2003). We
                recently found that astrocytes in the inferior colliculus, an auditory pathway
                structure with the highest metabolic rate in brain, are highly coupled by gap
                junctions (Ball et al., 2007) and are involved
                in selective syncytial ‘trafficking’ of energy and redox
                metabolites (Gandhi et al., 2009a), including
                lactate (Gandhi et al., 2009b). (Note: in the
                present study, metabolite ‘trafficking’ refers to transfer
                among cells of small molecules involved in metabolism, energetics and signalling by
                processes driven mainly by concentration gradients. Trafficking of small molecules
                involves diffusion and transporters, and differs from protein
                ‘trafficking’. Fluorescent dyes are used as surrogate markers
                to visualize and quantify movements of small molecules among cells.) We hypothesized
                that diabetes may cause ‘silent’ changes affecting astrocytic
                communication and metabolite trafficking via gap junctions may alter interactions
                among astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells (i.e. the neurovascular unit),
                thereby contributing to the slow, progressive brain dysfunction in diabetes. The
                present study, therefore, examined the effects of experimental diabetes on
                astrocytic gap junctional transport using two model systems, the STZ-diabetic rat
                and cultured astrocytes grown in medium containing very high glucose concentrations.

Studies in rat models of diabetes show that plasma and brain glucose levels increase
                on average by approx. 3-fold, with mean values in brain rising from 2.2
                μmol/g in controls to 6.9 μmol/g in diabetic animals (Table 1). In STZ-diabetic rats, the increases
                in plasma and brain glucose content occur within 2 days after STZ treatment and
                persist for months at levels similar to those in spontaneously diabetic rats (Table 1). The rise in brain glucose
                concentration with an increase in plasma glucose level is the expected consequence
                of concentration gradient-driven transport of glucose across the
                blood–brain barrier. Under steady state conditions in normal rats infused
                with various concentrations of glucose, the brain glucose level is approx. 20% that
                in plasma in the normo- and hyper-glycaemic range; in contrast, the brain plasma
                glucose distribution ratio falls during hypoglycaemia when glucose supply does not
                match demand (Dienel et al., 1991, 1997; Holden et
                    al., 1991). Thus brain glucose level rises when plasma glucose
                concentration increases, and in diabetic rats the brain: plasma glucose distribution
                ratio is even higher, approx. 50% greater than in control rats, and the elevated
                ratio is not normalized by acute insulin treatment to reduce plasma glucose level to
                the normal range (Hofer and Lanier, 1991a,
                    1991b). Corresponding studies of brain
                glucose level in human diabetics are sparse, but one NMR study reported a 1.5-fold
                increase in the level of glucose relative to creatine in diabetic brain and
                calculated a net rise in brain glucose level of approx. 2 mmol/l (Table 1). Routine commercially available tissue
                culture media contain glucose concentrations as high as 25 mmol/l glucose, which
                approximates to the level of glucose in the plasma of diabetic animals and exceeds
                the normal and diabetic rat brain glucose level by approx. 10- and 3-fold
                respectively (Table 1). Astrocytes grown in
                ‘high’-glucose media would be exposed to the myriad of
                well-established consequences of severe, chronic hyperglycaemia, and the
                pathophysiological consequences of neuronal and Schwann cell culture in high-glucose
                media have been recently emphasized by Kleman et al.
                    (2008) and Mìinea et al.
                    (2002). In the present study, astrocytes chronically exposed to elevated
                glucose levels in vivo and in vitro were used as
                models of experimental diabetes. We report that intercellular gap junction-mediated
                communication among astrocytes is markedly reduced in cultured cerebral cortical
                astrocytes and in slices of inferior colliculus from STZ-treated rats, and that
                pharmacological intervention can protect against or restore this impairment.

                    in T-75 culture flasks with DMEM containing 5.5 mmol/l glucose, 10% (v/v) FBS,
                    50 IU (international units) of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of
                    streptomycin at 37°C in humidified air containing 5% CO2.
                        l-LME (0.1 mmol/l), a lysosomotrophic agent that selectively
                    destroys mononuclear cells including microglia, was also included in the culture
                    medium, and the cultures were shaken by hand twice per week to remove microglia.
                    When confluent, the cells were trypsinized, seeded on to polylysine-coated glass
                    coverslips and grown to confluence in a medium containing amphotericin B (2.5
                    μg/ml). Then differentiation was induced by supplementing the culture
                    medium with 0.25 mmol/l dBcAMP. The next day, cells were maintained in a medium
                    containing 0.25 mmol/l dBcAMP and 5.5, 15 or 25 mmol/l glucose for up to 4
                    weeks. Purity of cultures was based on the expression of the astrocyte marker,
                    glial fibrillary acidic protein, which was expressed in >90% of the
                    cells.

STZ-induced diabetes
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (200–300 g; Harlan, Indianapolis,
                    IN, U.S.A.) were fasted overnight, injected intraperitoneally with STZ (65 mg/kg
                    body weight in 33 mmol/l citrate-buffered saline, pH 4.5); controls received the
                    same volume of citrate-buffered saline (Romanovsky et al., 2006). Tail blood samples were taken for glucose
                    determination from overnight-fasted animals on the day before STZ injection and
                    on days 3, 8 and 13 thereafter; rats were categorized as normoglycaemic or
                    hyperglycaemic, using a cut-off value of >6.9 mmol/l to define
                    hyperglycaemia based on the day 3 fasting blood glucose level. All animal use
                    procedures were in strict accordance with the NIH Guide for Care and Use of
                    Laboratory Animals and were approved by the local Animal Care and Use
                Committee.

Brain slice preparation
At 20–24 weeks after induction of STZ-diabetes, the diabetic and
                    age-matched, vehicle-injected control rats were deeply anaesthetized with
                    halothane and decapitated and their brains were quickly removed and chilled by
                    immersion in an oxygenated (i.e. bubbled with O2/CO2,
                    95:5), ice-cold aCSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) solution (concentrations
                    in mmol/l: 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 124 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2.0
                    MgSO4, 1.25 NaH2PO4 and 2.0 CaCl2,
                    pH 7.3) and 248 sucrose, and 250 μm-thick slices were cut using a
                    Leica (Heidelberg, Germany) VT 1000S tissue slicer; inferior colliculus slices
                    were incubated in oxygenated aCSF containing sucrose for 30 min at
                    35°C and then for 1 h at 22°C (Moyer and Brown, 1998). Slices of inferior colliculus were
                    transferred to an open bath perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT,
                    U.S.A.) on the microscope stage. Then the slices of inferior colliculus and the
                    cultured astrocytes were perfused (1 ml/min) with aCSF that was continuously
                    bubbled with O2/CO2 (95:5) and contained 26 mmol/l
                        NaHCO3 (pH 7.3) and 10 mmol/l glucose at approx.
                    21–22°C.

Gap junction dye transfer assays
Two procedures were used to insert a membrane-impermeant dye into astrocytes to
                    assay gap junctional communication, scrape-loading (el-Fouly et al., 1987; Giaume et al., 1991) and diffusion into a single cell impaled with a
                    micropipette (Ball et al., 2007; Gandhi et al., 2009a). Scrape loading is
                    commonly used for dye transfer assays because it is a simple procedure, but the
                    procedure destroys cells at the scrape site and releases their contents to the
                    medium; it requires medium changes and washing of cells after dye loading, and
                    it cannot be used in tissue slices in which astrocytes have formed their
                    syncytia during normal brain development involving interactions of astrocytes
                    with neurons and the vasculature. Microinjection of cells is technically more
                    difficult, but offers more control for dye loading, and it can be used in brain
                    slices. Fluorescent compounds used to assay dye transfer were LYVS (4% or 62
                    mmol/l), 4% LYVS plus 4% LYCH, Alexa Fluor® 350 (5 mmol/l) and 6-NBDG
                    (20 mmol/l). 6-NBDG is a non-metabolizable fluorescent analogue of glucose that
                    is a substrate for glucose transporters. In the brain slice assays of 6-NBDG gap
                    junctional transfer, 10 μmol/l of cytochalasin B, a glucose transport
                    inhibitor (Speizer et al. 1985), was
                    included to minimize efflux of 6-NBDG from cells via glucose transporters. In
                    these assays, an excess amount of pyruvate (10 mmol/l) was added to the
                    perfusate as an oxidative fuel to compensate for blockade of glucose transport.


                        Scrape loading
                    
The procedure of Giaume et al. (1991)
                        was used for scrape-load assays, as follows. Glass coverslips containing
                        astrocytes were transferred to sterile 35 mm culture dishes; coverslips were
                        washed once and incubated in ionic-buffered solution containing
                        (concentrations in mmol/l) 130 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2
                            MgCl2 and 10 Hepes (pH 7.2) for 1 min, washed again and
                        incubated in calcium-free medium for 1 min. The medium was replaced with a
                        calcium-free medium containing 0.5 mg/ml LYVS and 1 mmol/l
                        rhodamine–dextran (a non-permeant macromolecule used to label the
                        scrape-loaded cells); a 2–3 cm scrape was made with a razor
                        blade, and dye transfer was allowed for 2 min. Giaume et al. (1991) stated that calcium was omitted
                        from the medium during scrape-loading because 1 mmol/l Ca2+
                        blocks Lucifer Yellow transfer; Mg2+ was still included in the
                        scrape-load medium. A recent study showed that incubation of cultured
                        astrocytes in the nominal absence of extracellular bivalent cations
                            (Ca2+ and Mg2+) opens channels (hemichannels or
                        pannexin channels) that allow rapid, widespread entry of Lucifer Yellow into
                        astrocytes (Ye et al., 2003); the
                        presence of Mg2+ during the scrape-loading would prevent opening
                        of these channels. Cells were washed twice with calcium containing
                        ionic-buffered solution and dye-labelled area determined at 8 min after
                        scraping by image analysis using MetaVue software. Line scans were used to
                        evaluate the change in Lucifer Yellow fluorescent intensity as a function of
                        distance from the scrape site. The dye-labelled area was determined in three
                        regions of each scrape; regions were imaged, and gap junctional dye transfer
                        was calculated as the difference between the areas labelled by LYVS (gap
                        junction permeable) and rhodamine–dextran (labels the dye-loaded
                        cells); the mean value for each triplicate determination was used as the
                        area labelled in that scrape-load assay.


                        Dye diffusion into single cells
                    
For single-cell dye loading with micropipettes, cultured astrocytes were
                        visualized under DIC (differential interference contrast) and astrocytes in
                        brain slices were visualized under IR-DIC (IR-differential interference
                        contrast) (Dodt and
                            Zieglgänsberger, 1990) using a Nikon Eclipse E600
                        microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY, U.S.A.) equipped with a Nikon Fluor
                        ×40 [NA (numerical
                        aperture) = 0.80] objective and
                        Photometrics CoolSNAP ES camera (Roper Scientific, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A.).
                        Micropipettes with 12–14 MΩ
                        resistance (tip inner diameter: 1.0±0.1 μm, outer
                        diameter: 1.8±0.1 μm; means±S.D.) were
                        constructed from borosilicate glass (1 mm outer diameter, 0.5 mm inner
                        diameter) using a P97 pipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA,
                        U.S.A.) and filled with a test solution containing a fluorescent probe.
                        Except where noted, micropipette solutions contained (composition in mmol/l)
                        21.4 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 2 ATP, 0.5 GTP,
                        2 ascorbate and 10 Hepes, pH 7.2, and one of three fluorescent dyes (LYVS,
                        excitation/emission maxima: 430/530 nm; 6-NBDG, 475/550 nm; or Alexa
                        Fluor® 350, 346/442 nm). The osmolarity of each solution was
                        measured (Osmette II; Precision Systems, Natick, MA, U.S.A.) and adjusted to
                        305–320 mOsm/l with sucrose. Astrocytes were impaled with
                        micropipettes using an MP-225 manipulator (Sutter Instruments, San
                        Francisco, CA, U.S.A.), and tracers were diffused into cells for 2 min in
                        cultured cells and for 5 min in brain slices. Fluorescence intensity was
                        determined using MetaVue software before (background) and after diffusion of
                        the test compound into a single astrocyte, and the dye-labelled area was
                        determined with MetaVue software (Ball et
                            al., 2007; Gandhi et al.,
                        2009a). In brain slice assays, cells labelled with LYVS were counted
                        after cutting the 250 μm-thick slices into 10 μm-thick
                        serial sections; the number of labelled cells was based on counts of the
                        prominently labelled nuclei. The area labelled by 6-NBDG in slices was
                        measured in the intact slice with MetaVue software. Gap junctional transfer
                        was inhibited by pretreatment with octanol (final concentration, 0.6
                        mmol/l).

Dye transfer was also assayed in astrocytes cultured in media containing 5.5
                        or 25 mmol/l glucose for up to 21 days in the presence or absence of
                        compounds to reduce ROS/RNS levels or that facilitate protein folding.
                        MnTBAP (50 μmol/l) is a superoxide dimutase mimetic that is a
                        scavenger of ROS (Kowluru and Abbas,
                        2003) and l-NAME (1 mmol/l), a competitive inhibitor of NOS
                        (nitric oxide synthase) that impairs formation of nitric oxide and RNS
                            (Hink et al., 2001). Chemical
                        chaperones (Brown et al., 1996; Welch and Brown, 1996; Özcan et al., 2006), 4-PBA
                        (1 mmol/l), glycerol (25 mmol/l), TUDCA (25 mmol/l) and TMAO (100 mmol/l)
                        were added to the culture media at the time intervals indicated. Tunicamycin
                        (100 ng/ml, 16 h), an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation that causes ER
                        (endoplasmic reticulum) stress, served as the positive control for ER
                        stress; butyrate (1 mmol/l) was a control for 4-PBA. After cultured
                        astrocytes were treated for the time intervals indicated, LYVS transfer was
                        assayed by impaling a single astrocyte with a micropipette, allowing the dye
                        to diffuse for 2 min, and then the dye-labelled area was measured using
                        MetaVue software.

Oxidative stress assays
Astrocytes were grown in 5.5 or 25 mmol/l glucose in the presence or absence of
                    inhibitors or chaperones, and ‘oxidative stress’ was
                    assayed with DCF-DA or carboxy-DCF-DA, compounds that are cell membrane
                    permeable, cleaved by intracellular esterases and, after oxidation by various
                    reactive compounds, become fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) or carboxy-DCF
                        (Tampo et al., 2003; Cruthirds et al., 2005 and references cited
                    in these studies). At indicated days in culture, DCF-DA (10 μmol/l)
                    was added to the culture medium (that had been changed 24 h earlier) or to a
                    fresh medium containing the inhibitors plus 30 μmol/l DCF-DA. Cells
                    were returned to the CO2 incubator for 30 min at 37°C,
                    then washed with perfusion solution, and DCF fluorescence intensity was measured
                    with the Nikon E600 microscope (×40 objective) and MetaVue software.
                    Ten field-of-view images were collected per coverslip, and analysed by
                    thresholding to include the pixels with the highest 30% or highest 2%
                    fluorescence intensity; the 30% threshold value excluded background fluorescence
                    and included the cell bodies plus ‘hot spots’, whereas the
                    2% threshold included only the highest-intensity ‘hot
                    spots’. Slices of inferior colliculus from diabetic rats were
                    incubated for 30 min in 10 μmol/l carboxy-DCF-DA and fluorescence
                    intensity assayed as described above.

Cx immunostaining
Cultured astrocytes on coverslips were fixed with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in
                    0.1 M PBS for 10 min, washed three times with PTX (0.1 M PBS containing 0.3%
                    Triton X), blocked in 10% (v/v) goat serum in PTX for 30 min, and incubated with
                    rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies (diluted in 10% goat serum in PTX as
                    follows: Cx43, 1:250 to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml; Cx30,
                    1:250, to 1 μg/ml; Cx26, 1:25, to 5 μg/ml) for 2 h at room
                    temperature (approx. 21–22°C) and then overnight at
                    4°C. The manufacturer's recommended levels for use in
                    frozen sections were 1–5 μg/ml for Cx43 and Cx30
                    antibodies and 10–20 μg/ml for Cx26; in the present study,
                    the dilution of Cx43 was the same as that used by Ye et al. (2003). The next day, samples were warmed to
                    room temperature, washed with PTX (three 5 min washes), incubated with goat
                    anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red (diluted 1:500 in 10%
                    goat serum in PTX) for 1 h at room temperature, given three 5-min washes with
                    PTX and stored at 4°C in PBS. Immunostained Cx protein includes
                    intracellular punctate or vesicle-like structures (probably ER, Golgi apparatus
                    and cytoplasmic vesicles; see Wolff et al.,
                        1998 and references cited therein), that were prominent in the images
                    of immunoreactive Cxs under the fixation and immunoassay conditions used in the
                    present study (see the Results section). The area of this punctate or vesicular
                    immunoreactive material was measured by image analysis of composite images of
                    z-stacks using the maximum projection setting with a Nikon E600 microscope with
                    confocal attachments and a ×60 water immersion objective (NA 1.00)
                    and MetaVue software. The minimal fluorescence intensity threshold value was set
                    to only include prominent punctate or vesicle-like structures, and integrated
                    morphometric analysis was used to measure their total area in each of the
                    16–36 cells per Cx group that were derived from two independent
                    cultures.

Statistics
Comparisons between two groups of independent samples were made with two-tailed,
                    unpaired t tests. Comparisons among three or more groups of
                    independent samples were made with one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's test
                    for multiple comparisons against the same control value or the Bonferroni test
                    for multiple comparisons among experimental groups.
                    P<0.05 was considered to be statistically
                    significant. All statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
                    Prism® software, version 5.02 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
                    U.S.A.).

                    in 5.5 mmol/l glucose greatly exceeded that of astrocytes grown in 25 mmol/l
                    glucose (Figure 1A). Line scan analysis of
                    Lucifer Yellow fluorescence intensity with distance showed that overall LYVS
                    fluorescence level was higher and dye spread extended further from the scrape
                    site in cells grown in the lower glucose concentration (Figure 1B). The mean LYVS intensity in the pixels closest to
                    the scrape site (at 0.6 μm) tended to be higher
                    (P = 0.084) in the low-glucose
                    cultures and it reached a peak (∼2600 fluorescence units) at
                    26–29 μm from the scrape, whereas the high-glucose
                    cultures had a much lower mean maximal value (∼1700 fluorescence
                    units; P<0.001) and a broader peak that was closer
                    (7.7–20 μm) to the scrape (Figure 1B). At 90–100 μm from the scrape the
                    fluorescence intensities in the low glucose group were still 22% higher
                        (P<0.001) than in the higher glucose group.
                    These findings suggest that the lower dye levels and reduced dye spread in
                    severely hyperglycaemic astrocytes are not due to differential release of
                    Lucifer Yellow from cells during the scrape load procedure via Cx
                    ‘hemichannels’ or pannexin channels. If these channels
                    were preferentially open to the medium in either group of cells, extensive dye
                    labelling would be expected to increase markedly throughout the culture, not
                    just adjacent to the scrape site, as observed (Figures 1A and 1B); this labelling would be readily detected by
                    visual observation because the LYVS causes prominent labelling of nuclei.

The net area labelled by LYVS was calculated by subtracting the area of the
                    scrape-filled cells (i.e. area labelled by the gap junction-impermeant tracer,
                    rhodamine–dextran) from that labelled by LYVS. Astrocytes grown in
                    low glucose had a 4-fold higher dye-labelled area than those grown in high
                    glucose (Figure 1C). Blockade of gap
                    junctions with octanol reduced the LYVS-labelled area (Figure 1C) to the level of that labelled by
                    rhodamine–dextran (results not shown).

(A) Cultured astrocytes were grown in low or high glucose
                            for 21 days, and gap junctional transfer of LYVS (1 mmol/l) was assayed
                            by dye transfer after scrape loading. The scrapes are in the centre of
                            each panel, and the scale bar (100 μm) applies to both
                            panels. (B) Line scan analysis (using a 100 μm

                            are means and vertical bars are 1 S.D. The Lucifer Yellow-labelled area
                            was calculated as the difference in areas labelled by Lucifer Yellow and
                            rhodamine–dextran (1 mmol/l), a gap junction-impermeant
                            tracer that labels only the scrape-loaded cells.

Prolonged exposure to high glucose is required to reduce dye transfer
Glucose concentration in the culture medium did not affect astrocyte viability,
                    and astrocytes grown in 5.5, 15 and 25 mmol/l glucose had similar cell densities
                    on days 3, 14 and 21 (results not shown), as illustrated in Figure 2 for representative cultures grown for 2 weeks in
                    5.5 mmol/l (Figure 2A) or 25 mmol/l (Figure 2B) glucose. However, when gap
                    junctional communication was assayed by impaling a single astrocyte with a
                    micropipette and diffusing Lucifer Yellow into one cell, dye spreading from the
                    impaled cell was much greater in cells grown for 3 weeks in 5.5 mmol/l glucose
                        (Figure 2C) compared with those grown
                    in 25 mmol/l glucose (Figure 2D),
                    confirming the results of scrape-load assays (Figure 1).

Time in culture did not affect the area labelled by Lucifer Yellow in astrocytes
                    grown in low glucose, but those grown in high glucose had a progressive decrease
                    in gap junctional communication (Figure
                    2E). Impaired LYVS transfer had a slow onset, requiring approx.
                    3–5 days exposure to 15 or 25 mmol/l glucose before a statistically
                    significant decrement was detectable. The time courses and maximal inhibition
                    for cells grown in 15 and 25 mmol/l glucose were similar; the maximal decrement
                    in gap junctional communication was relatively stable at approx. 50% of that in
                    the low-glucose cultures during the interval from 7 to 21 days (Figure 2E).

Diffusion of a smaller fluorescent dye, Alexa Fluor® 350, among
                    astrocytes was stable with time in the low-glucose cultures, and it also
                    exhibited a progressive fall in labelled area in the high-glucose cultures
                        (Figure 2F). There was a 5-day delay
                    before Alexa Fluor® 350-labelled area was reduced by high glucose,
                    and the 50% decrement was stable between 7 and 21 days. Thus the two dyes had
                    similar lag times, temporal profiles and maximal reduction of labelled area,
                    suggesting that reduced dye transfer may not be simply due to partial
                    constriction of the gap junctional channel to block the passage of larger
                    molecules (Alexa Fluor® 350 has a molecular mass of 311 Da after
                    hydrolysis of the succinimidyl ester by water compared with 536 Da for the
                    ionized form of LYVS). Note that Alexa Fluor® 350 does label a
                    greater area than the LYVS in the low-glucose cultures (e.g.
                    P<0.01 on day 1; compare Figures 2E and 2F); this is probably due mainly to its high
                    fluorescence quantum yield (the concentration of Alexa Fluor® 350 in
                    the micropipette was 5 mmol/l compared with 62 mmol/l for LYVS), and perhaps
                    also to its smaller size.

                            diffused into the cell for 2 min and the labelled area was measured

                            21, 10 and 21 at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17 and 21 days; 15 mmol/l glucose,
                                n = 20, 20, 20, 18
                            at 3, 7, 14 and 21 days; 25 mmol/l glucose,

                            of samples per group at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17 and 21 days is as

                            the respective 5.5 mmol/l glucose group.

Dye transfer deficit is not restored by subsequent glycaemic control
When astrocytes were grown in 15 or 25 mmol/l glucose for 2 weeks and then
                    transferred to 5.5 mmol/l glucose for an additional 2 weeks, LYVS spreading via
                    gap junctions did not recover. Dye transfer remained subnormal after either 7 or
                    14 days in the low-glucose media (Figure
                    3), indicating that the acquired decrement in gap junctional
                    communication could not be reversed within 2 weeks by simply reducing the
                    glucose concentration in the culture medium.

Figure 3 Glycaemic control does not reverse the deficit previously acquired
                            during growth in hyperglycaemic conditions
Cultured astrocytes were grown in medium containing the indicated glucose
                            concentrations for 14 days. Then the cells grown in 15 or 25 mmol/l
                            glucose were also cultured in medium containing 5.5 mmol/l glucose, and
                            all cultures continued for an additional 7 or 14 days. At the time
                            intervals indicated, dye transfer was assayed by impaling a single
                            astrocyte with a micropipette, dye was diffused into the cell for 2 min
                            and labelled area was measured. The respective number of samples/group
                            at 21 and 28 days is as follows: 5.5 mmol/l glucose,
                            n = 20 and 10; 15
                            mmol/l glucose, n = 10
                            and 10; and 25 mmol/l glucose,
                            n = 20 and 10. Cells
                            in each experimental group were derived from at least three independent
                            cultures. Values are means and vertical bars represent 1 S.D.; when bars
                            are not visible, they are smaller than the symbol.

Oxidative stress precedes impairment of gap junctional communication
Because diabetes is associated with oxidative stress (Brownlee, 2005), DCF fluorescence was assayed at intervals
                    after exposure of astrocytes to the high-glucose medium to assess changes in the
                    levels of ROS and RNS. Increased DCF fluorescence was detectable after 1 day of
                    exposure to high glucose, with a progressive rise with time in culture (Figure 4). Elevated ROS/RNS production
                    preceded impairment of gap junctional communication that became evident only
                    after 3–5 days of exposure to very high glucose (compare Figures 2E, 2F and 4).

Figure 4 Oxidative stress is detectable after 1 day of severe hyperglycaemia
                            and remains elevated
Cultured astrocytes were grown in media containing 5.5 or 25 mmol/l
                            glucose for 14 days. ROS/RNS production was assayed by DCF fluorescence
                            (30 min incubation in 10 μmol/l DCFDA) and quantified using
                            MetaVue software, with thresholding to include either the highest 2% or
                            30% fluorescence intensities; thresholding at 30% excluded the
                            background and thresholding at 2% quantified the small ‘hot
                            spots’ that are readily visible in the images. The values
                            thresholded at 2% and 30% were similar for cells grown in 5.5 mmol/l
                            glucose; comparisons between the cells grown in 5.5 or 25 mmol/l glucose
                            were made for each respective threshold value. Endogenous fluorescence
                            in the absence of DCF was 114±3 (30% threshold) and
                            123±5 (2% threshold) for cells grown in 5.5 mmol/l glucose
                            for 3 or 7 days, and slightly lower values were obtained for cells grown
                            in 25 mmol/l glucose (results not shown). These control values for
                            endogenous fluorescence were not subtracted from those in which DCF was
                            added to assay NOS/ROS production, indicating that generation of DCF
                            fluorescence by reactive species in low-glucose media is very low. The
                            respective number of samples per group at 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days is as
                            follows: 5.5 mmol/l glucose,
                            n = 30, 29, 30, 30 and

                            ×200 μm) of astrocytes grown on coverslips;
                            results are from up to ten images per coverslip and three to five
                            coverslips per group. Cells in each experimental group were derived from
                            at least three independent cultures. Values are means and vertical bars
                            represent 1 S.D.; when bars are not visible, they are smaller than the
                            symbol. ***P<0.001, for the indicated

                        Focal oxidative stress
                    
The high-glucose cultures had focal ‘hot spots’ of
                        greater DCF fluorescence intensities (quantified by thresholding the highest
                        2% fluorescence values; see the Materials and methods section) that averaged
                        approximately twice those of the overall mean intensities in the
                        high-glucose cultures (thresholded at 30%) at all time points (Figure 4). The hot spots in the
                        hyperglycaemic cultures also had quite large S.D. values. In contrast, hot
                        spots in the control cultures grown in 5.5 mmol/l glucose had fluorescence
                        intensities closer to the overall mean intensities (Figure 4).


                        Magnitude of oxidative stress is variable in culture
                        batches
                    
In a replicate experiment (results not shown) in which astrocytes were grown
                        in high or low glucose for 1, 3, 7 or 14 days
                        (n = 3–5
                        coverslips per group with 9–11 regions of interest assayed per
                        coverslip for a total of 44–70 regions per group) the cells were
                        incubated for 30 min in 30 μmol/l DCF-DA, and at each time point,
                        DCF fluorescence was statistically significantly higher in cells grown in 25
                        mmol/l glucose compared with those in 5.5 mmol/l glucose
                        (P<0.001). However, the mean DCF fluorescence
                        intensities in the high-glucose cultures were more similar to each other at
                        each time point, differing somewhat from the data set in Figure 4. The high glucose/low glucose
                        ratio of DCF values in the replicate cultures was 1.86, 2.84, 2.04 and 2.67
                        at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days for threshold at 30%, and 2.52, 4.02, 2.42, and 4.78
                        respectively for the ‘hot spots’ quantified by
                        thresholding at 2%. Thus the high-glucose cultures have higher DCF
                        fluorescence than those grown in low glucose, but replicate assays can
                        differ in magnitude. For unidentified reasons, some astrocytes grown in high
                        glucose exhibited low DCF fluorescence at 14 days, but they still had
                        reduced trafficking of LYVS. Unfortunately, the oxidative stress and gap
                        junctional transfer assays do not permit longitudinal studies on the same
                        cells; the properties of the cells before the assay are unknown.

Diabetic rat brain exhibits abnormal dye transfer and oxidative stress
The body weight of STZ-diabetic rats during the 13–20-week interval
                    after onset of diabetes averaged 53±2%
                    (n = 4) of age-matched,
                    vehicle-injected controls
                    (n = 4), and at 20 weeks, the
                    respective body weights were 268±36 and 471±19 g. At the
                    time of assay for dye transfer and oxidative stress, the arterial plasma glucose
                    level in diabetic rats was elevated 4.1-fold compared with controls
                    (33.1±5.2 and 8.0±0.9 mmol/l respectively;
                    P<0.001), whereas arterial plasma lactate content
                    was unchanged (2.2±0.7 and 2.2±0.4 mmol/l respectively).
                    To verify that brain glucose levels were also elevated in our STZ rats, the
                    glucose concentration was assayed in ethanol extracts of cerebral cortex
                    dissected from funnel-frozen brains of two STZ rats, using previously described
                    methods (Dienel et al., 2007). The brain
                    glucose concentrations were 8.2 and 6.8 μmol/g, indicating that both
                    plasma and brain glucose levels in the STZ rats used in the present study were
                    within the range of the mean literature values tabulated in Table 1.

Dye transfer among gap junction coupled astrocytes was assayed by dye diffusion
                    into single astrocytes in slices of the inferior colliculus from age-matched,
                    vehicle-treated control and STZ-diabetic rats. Both Lucifer Yellow and 6-NBDG
                    had greater dye labelling in slices from control rats (Figures 5A and 5C) compared with those from STZ-treated rats
                        (Figures 5B and 5D). The number of
                    LYVS-labelled cells was 7.7-fold higher in slices from control compared with
                    diabetic rats (Figure 6A), whereas the area
                    labelled by the fluorescent glucose analogue, 6-NBDG (342 Da), was 2.2-fold
                    greater in control compared with diabetic rat slices (Figure 6B). DCF fluorescence in diabetic brain slices was
                    3.2 times that in controls (Figure 6C).
                    Thus gap junctional communication was reduced and oxidative stress was increased
                    in slices of the inferior colliculus from diabetic rats at 20–24
                    weeks after STZ treatment, as observed in cultured astrocytes that were exposed
                    to much higher glucose levels for short time intervals (compare with Figures 2 and 4).

Figure 5 Reduced dye transfer among astrocytes in brain slices from
                            STZ-diabetic rats compared with controls
Gap junctional communication was assayed in slices of inferior colliculus
                            from age-matched, vehicle-injected controls (A,
                            C) and STZ-diabetic rats at 20–24 weeks after
                            the onset of diabetes (B, D). A single
                            astrocyte was impaled with a micropipette containing either Lucifer
                            Yellow (A, B) or 6-NBDG (C,
                                D), and the dye was diffused into the cell for 5 min.
                            The Lucifer Yellow was a mixture of LYVS (4 g/100 ml)+LYCH (4 g/100 ml).
                            6-NBDG (5 mmol/l) is a non-metabolizable fluorescent analogue of
                            glucose. The scale bars in (A, B) are 200
                            μm (imaged with a ×10 objective), and those in
                                (C, D) are 40 μm (imaged with a
                            ×40 objective). Arrows in (C, D)
                            indicate the NBDG-containing micropipette.

Figure 6 Gap junctional communication and oxidative stress in brain slices
                            from control and STZ-diabetic rats
Dye transfer was assayed in slices of inferior colliculus from adult male
                            rats at 20–24 weeks after the onset of STZ-induced diabetes
                            and in age-matched, vehicle-injected controls by impaling a single
                            astrocyte with a tracer-containing micropipette and diffusing the tracer
                            for 5 min (for more details, see the legend to Figure 5).
                            (A) Cells labelled with LYVS+LYCH
                            (n = 19, with 1
                            injection into each of 19 brain slices derived from 4 control rats and
                            19 slices from four diabetic rats). (B) Area labelled with
                            6-NBDG (n = 20
                            injections into ten slices from five control rats and 16 injections into
                            eight slices from four diabetic rats). Note that the NBDG-labelled areas
                            were measured in slices while viewing with a ×40 objective
                            because the area labelled in the STZ-rat slices was difficult to
                            determine with a ×10 objective; the NBDG-labelled area in the
                            control rats was, therefore, probably underestimated (see Figure 5) and
                            the difference between control and diabetic rats is likely to be greater
                            than shown in (B). (C) Formation of ROS/RNS

Pharmacological treatment can induce, prevent or restore changes in gap
                    junctional permeability
ER stress is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes, and
                    treatment with chemical chaperones that reduce ER stress normalizes many
                    pathophysiological consequences of Type 2 diabetes (Özcan et al., 2004, 2006). A toxin that induces ER stress, ROS/NOS blockers
                    that can reduce oxidative stress (Cruthirds et
                        al., 2005) and chemical chaperones known to facilitate protein
                    folding (Welch and Brown, 1996; Özcan et al., 2006) were,
                    therefore, tested for their ability to cause, prevent or restore deficits in gap
                    junctional communication.


                        ER stress impairs gap junctional communication
                    
Tunicamycin is an inhibitor of N-acetylglucosamine
                        transferases known to cause ER stress by blocking the formation of
                        N-glycosidic protein–carbohydrate linkages and
                        preventing the glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER.
                        Astrocytes were grown for 2 weeks in low glucose and then treated with
                        tunicamycin for 16 h and dye transfer was assayed. The dye-labelled area was
                        reduced by tunicamycin to the low level observed in vehicle-treated cells
                        that were grown in high glucose for 2 weeks (Figure 7A), i.e. the Lucifer Yellow-labelled area was approx.
                        4000 μm2 under both these conditions. For comparison
                        with these values, astrocytes grown in low glucose for up to 3 weeks had a
                        Lucifer Yellow-labelled area of approx. 15 000
                            μm2 (Figures
                        2 and 3) and the 2–3
                        week values for low-glucose cultures from Figures 2 and 3 are
                        included in Figures 7(A) and 7(B) as
                        reference values. However, to avoid additional multiple statistical
                        comparisons against the same data sets, comparisons in Figures 7(A) and 7(B) were made against the
                        vehicle-treated control grown in high glucose or the no treatment group in
                        the high-to-low glucose transfer assay.


                        ROS/RNS inhibitors and chemical chaperones are protective in the
                            presence of high glucose
                    
Continuous 2-week treatment of cultured astrocytes grown in high glucose with
                        MnTBAP, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, or with l-NAME, an
                        inhibitor of NOS (alone or in combination) prevented the
                        high-glucose-induced decrement in dye transfer (Figure 7A). Similarly, four chemically different
                        chaperone molecules (4-PBA, glycerol, TMAO and TUDCA) also protected against
                        dye transfer impairment, whereas butyrate, a control for 4-PBA, did not
                            (Figure 7A).


                        Chaperones, not ROS/RNS inhibitors, restore the acquired
                        deficit
                    
Astrocytes were grown for 2 weeks in high glucose and then transferred to the
                        low-glucose medium containing vehicle or other compounds for 7 days. The
                        dye-labelled area in vehicle-treated astrocytes remained at the low level
                            (Figure 7B) obtained for astrocytes
                        previously grown in high glucose (compare with Figure 3). Inclusion of MnTBAP or l-NAME in the
                        low-glucose medium did not restore gap junctional trafficking (i.e. the
                        dye-labelled area remained low), whereas inclusion of two chaperones, 4-PBA
                        and TUDCA, did improve dye transfer and increased the labelled area (Figure 7B).


                        Oxidative stress is eliminated by transfer to low glucose
                    
DCF fluorescence was elevated in cells grown in high glucose for 3 weeks
                        compared with those grown in low glucose. However, when astrocytes were
                        grown in high glucose for 2 weeks and then transferred to low glucose for an
                        additional week, the level of oxidative stress fell to that of cells
                        continuously grown in low glucose for 3 weeks (Figure 7C). Thus the decrement in gap junctional communication
                        caused by prior exposure to high glucose persists (Figure 7B, no treatment group), even though oxidative
                        stress is eliminated (Figure 7C) by
                        reducing the glucose level in the culture medium.

                                reference, the dye-labelled area obtained in low-glucose cultures
                                grown for 2 weeks (results from Figure 2E) are included in
                                (A), and that from low-glucose cultures at 3 weeks
                                (results from Figure 3) are included in (B). However,
                                statistical comparisons did not include these data to avoid
                                additional multiple comparisons against the same data sets in other

                                fluorescence was thresholded at 30% or 2% of fluorescence intensity
                                as described in the caption of Figure 4 to quantify the overall

                                were against the 5.5 mmol/l glucose group

                                n = 20 for 21

                        Effect of gap junction permeability modulators on oxidative
                        stress
                    
The ROS/RNS blockers would be expected to improve gap junctional
                        communication by reducing or preventing the rise in DCF fluorescence in
                        cells grown in high glucose, whereas the chaperone molecules would not be
                        expected to alter glucose-induced oxidative stress. To test these
                        predictions, DCF fluorescence was assayed in two independent experiments
                        using different batches of astrocytes that were grown for 2 weeks in 25
                        mmol/l glucose in the continuous presence of each of the test compounds
                        shown in Figure 7(A)
                        (n = 30–40
                        samples per group per experiment). Unfortunately, the results in the
                        replicate assays were variable (results not shown), and further work is
                        required to identify factors that influence the response of DCF fluorescence
                        intensity to these drug treatments.


                        Summary of results of pharmacological studies
                    
Both prolonged exposure to high glucose and short-term tunicamycin treatment
                        impair astrocytic gap junctional communication. In high-glucose cultures,
                        oxidative stress is detectable on day 1 (Figure 4), whereas the fall in dye transfer becomes manifest at
                        approx. 3–5 days (Figures 2E and
                        2F). Transfer of cells from high- to low-glucose medium was
                        sufficient to reduce DCF fluorescence to control levels (Figure 7C), but not restore dye transfer
                        to normal within 2 weeks (Figure 3).
                        ROS/RNS inhibitors could prevent this deficit if included in the medium at
                        the onset of exposure to high glucose (Figure
                            7A), but could not improve the acquired deficit that persisted in
                        the low-glucose medium (Figure 7B).
                        Chaperone treatment could, however, restore the gap junctional deficit in
                        the presence of high glucose (Figure
                        7A), as well as in the presence (Figure
                            7A) or absence (Figures 7B and
                        7C) of elevated DCF fluorescence. Thus prolonged antecedent oxidative
                        stress is linked to reduced gap junctional trafficking, but reducing ROS/RNS
                        levels after the onset of the deficit did not restore dye transfer (Figure 3). In sharp contrast, the
                        persistent change in Cx function acquired by growth in high glucose was
                        ameliorated by four different chaperone molecules that can improve protein
                        folding

Immunoreactive Cx protein
All astrocytes exhibited immunostaining for Cx43, Cx30 and Cx26, with the most
                    intense immunoreactivity mainly in intracellular material, as illustrated for
                    astrocytes grown for 2 weeks in 5.5 mmol/l glucose (Figure 8, left column). Intracellular immunostained Cx
                    protein can include ER, Golgi apparatus and cytoplasmic vesicles (Wolff et al., 1998 and references cited
                    therein), and punctate, vesicle-like intracellular staining in astrocytes is
                    evident in other studies (e.g. Ye et al.,
                    2003). The area of the immunoreactive punctate structures in astrocytes
                    grown in high glucose was reduced to approx. 50% and 25% of that in the
                    low-glucose cultures respectively for Cx43 and Cx30, whereas that for Cx26 was
                    unaffected (Figure 8, right column). Thus
                    the morphological appearance of immunoreactive Cx protein is selectively
                    influenced by medium glucose concentration, perhaps reflecting changes in
                    trafficking or turnover of these proteins.

Figure 8 Effect of hyperglycaemia on staining of immunoreactive Cx proteins in
                            cultured astrocytes
Composite z-stacks of confocal images (left column) of immunostained
                            astrocytes showed a low-intensity background and prominent staining of
                            punctate or vesicular immunoreactive material that appeared to be mainly
                            intracellular. This morphological appearance of immunostaining was
                            evident for Cx43 (A), Cx30 (B) and Cx26
                                (C) protein in astrocytes grown on coverslips for 14
                            days in a medium containing 5.5 mmol/l glucose; the scale bar is 12.5
                            μm and applies to all panels. Areas of these immunostained
                            punctate/vesicular objects (right columns) are means (vertical bars
                            represent 1 S.D.) from the following numbers of objects per group: Cx43,
                            5.5 mmol/l: n = 752
                            objects in cells on five coverslips; 25 mmol/l:
                            n = 884 objects in
                            cells on five coverslips; Cx30, 5.5 mmol/l:
                            n = 1099 objects, five
                            coverslips; 25 mmol/l:
                            n = 1177 objects, five
                            coverslips; Cx26, 5.5 mmol/l:
                            n = 514 objects, four
                            coverslips; and 25 mmol/l:
                            n = 974 objects, five
                            coverslips.

DISCUSSION
Prolonged hyperglycaemia interferes with astrocytic gap junctional
                    communication
The two major findings of the present study are that chronic hyperglycaemia and
                    STZ-induced diabetes markedly reduce gap junctional dye transfer among
                    astrocytes and that the impairment of gap junctional communication can be
                    prevented and rescued by pharmacological treatment with compounds that reduce
                    oxidative stress or improve protein folding. Impaired transcellular
                    communication had a slow onset and, once established, it was poorly reversible
                    by subsequent glycaemic control. This deficit was detectable with three tracers
                    of different sizes and charges (Lucifer Yellow, Alexa Fluor® 350 and
                    6-NBDG, a non-metabolizable glucose analogue), and the scrape-loading assays
                    indicate that it did not arise from differential dye release by hyperglycaemic
                    cells via pannexin pores or Cx hemichannels (Figures 1–3). Because increased DCF fluorescence
                    preceded the onset of the decline in gap junctional permeability by
                    3–5 days and ROS/RNS blockers could prevent but not rescue the
                    decrement (Figures 4 and 7), damage arising from oxidative stress may
                    be a causative factor. Acute tunicamycin treatment generates abnormal newly
                    synthesized proteins, causes ER stress and impairs dye transfer within 16 h
                    without hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress. However, results of our ongoing
                    studies indicate that expression of selected markers for ER stress is delayed
                    compared with onset of reduced gap junctional communication in hyperglycaemic
                    cultured astrocytes, suggesting that gap junctional impairment may be an early,
                    relatively selective event in the pathophysiology of diabetes.

High glucose is sufficient to impair gap junctional communication
The effects of chronic hyperglycaemia and complications of diabetes are very
                    complex, and relationships among pathophysiology, threshold glucose level and
                    cumulative exposure to elevated glucose concentrations are very difficult to
                    define. However, tissue culture experiments demonstrate that severe, chronic
                    hyperglycaemia itself is sufficient to disrupt gap junctional communication in
                    astrocytes in the absence of endocrine dysfunction and multiorgan interactions.
                    Both of our experimental model systems, cultured astrocytes and STZ-rats, have
                    high glucose concentration as a variable, but they differ with respect to
                    maximal glucose level, cumulative exposure and effects of interactions among
                    brain cell types and among body organs. Cumulative exposure can be expressed as
                    the product of glucose concentration multiplied by time, or the area under a
                    plot of concentration as a function of time. Different pathophysiological
                    processes can be expected to take place at various threshold levels of glucose
                    concentration. For example, glucose flux into the sorbitol pathway will
                    progressively increase as glucose concentration rises above normal due to the
                    high Km of aldose reductase for glucose
                    (∼25 mM). The threshold concentrations and cumulative exposure
                    required to cause various effects of elevated glucose (e.g. non-enzymatic
                    glycation reactions, oxidative stress and disruption of signalling pathways) are
                    unknown, but these effects could be expected to increase with glucose level and
                    duration of exposure (Mìinea et al.,
                        2002). Brain glucose levels are lower than in peripheral tissues
                    owing to the restrictive transport properties of the blood–brain
                    barrier (Table 1), but diabetic patients
                    live with the disease for decades, facilitating cumulative CNS (central nervous
                    system) effects of chronic hyperglycaemia.

Growth of cultured cells under severely hyperglycaemic conditions is a
                    pathophysiological condition relevant to diabetes. Commercially available tissue
                    culture media can contain glucose concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 mmol/l
                    and, for example, DMEM is formulated with 0, 5.56 or 25 mmol/l glucose,
                    Ham's nutrient mixtures can have 7, 10 or 17.5 mmol/l glucose and
                    Neurobasal™ medium (Brewer et al.,
                        1993) contains 25 mmol/l glucose. Even a
                    ‘low-glucose’ medium, 5–6 mmol/l glucose, is
                    approximately twice the normal rat brain glucose concentration (i.e. approx.
                    2–3 μmol/g) and is equivalent to severe diabetes in rat
                    brain (Table 1). Growth of astrocytes in
                    22 mmol/l glucose reduces both glucose and lactate oxidation by approx. 50%
                    compared with cells grown in 2 mmol/l glucose (Abe et al., 2006), and would be expected to predispose astrocytes
                    grown in high glucose to increased glycolytic metabolism and greater lactate
                    release. In cultured neurons, the lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme pattern was
                    not altered by medium glucose level (5.5, 13.4 or 26.8 mmol/l; O’Brien et al., 2007), but Kleman et al. (2008) emphasize the negative
                    effects of high glucose levels on the viability of cultured neurons and neuronal
                    responsiveness to the AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) energy signalling
                    system. High glucose may or may not influence experimental outcome, but diabetic
                    complications are, nevertheless, a concern for astrocytes and neurons grown in
                    high glucose, and it is important to re-evaluate the results of such studies
                    (e.g. 20 mmol/l glucose: Ye et al.,
                    2001, 2003, 2009; McCoy and
                        Sontheimer, 2010; 25 mmol/l glucose: Sorg and Magistretti, 1991; Yu et
                        al., 1993; Takahashi et al.,
                    1995; Itoh et al., 2003; Pellerin and Magistretti, 2005, 1994; Chenal and Pellerin, 2007; and 50 mmol/l glucose: Bliss et al., 2004). Also, Methods sections
                    in published studies sometimes only identify the ‘generic’
                    culture medium (e.g. DMEM) without stating the glucose level or other key
                    constituents; ideally, the catalogue number of the medium should be reported so
                    its formulation is available. The use of normal brain tissue glucose levels for
                    growth of cultured cells with twice-weekly feeding schedules may also have
                    nutritional complexities. For example, our unpublished data (K.K. Ball, N.F.
                    Cruz and G.A. Dienel) indicate that astrocytes grown in 5.5 mmol/l glucose
                    consume most of the glucose within approx. 12–18 h, with release of
                    lactate to the medium; this lactate can be subsequently consumed as an oxidative
                    substrate, along with glutamine and other substrates in the medium. Daily
                    replenishment of glucose and other nutrients and removal of lactate and other
                    compounds released to the culture medium may be necessary to control levels of
                    extracellular metabolites, but total medium replacement could also negatively
                    affect the cells due to various ‘stresses’ associated with
                    removal from the incubator and medium change, e.g. shear stress to the surface
                    of the cells, transient loss of CO2 and buffering capacity, and
                    transient hypoxia and hypothermia.

Abnormal proteins and therapeutic potential
Covalent protein modification can arise from various causes known to occur in
                    diabetes, e.g. non-enzymatic glycation reactions and formation of advanced
                    glycation end-products, protein carbonylation reactions, and altered regulation
                    of gene expression and signalling pathways causing abnormal phosphorylation or
                    nitrosylation states (Bonnefont-Rousselot,
                    2002; Brownlee, 2005). The ability
                    of four different chaperone molecules that can facilitate protein folding in
                    other experimental systems to (i) prevent the decline in dye transfer even in
                    the presence of high glucose levels and oxidative stress and (ii) rescue an
                    established deficit (Figure 7) suggests
                    that changes to Cx proteins secondary to oxidative stress may cause abnormal
                    protein structure, folding, protein–protein interactions or protein
                    trafficking that may be reflected by the morphological changes in intracellular
                    non-junctional immunoreactive Cx 43 and 30 protein (Figure 8). Further work is required to evaluate the
                    contributions of these possibilities to altered non-junctional immunoreactive
                    material in diabetic astrocytes. Poor reversibility of gap junctional
                    communication after reversion to low-glucose culture media (Figures 3 and 7B)
                    underscores the importance of continuous, strict glycaemic control in diabetic
                    patients. The effectiveness of treatment with chaperones (Figure 7) that are already approved for human use (e.g.
                    4-phenylbutyrate and TUDCA; Özcan et
                        al., 2006) opens a therapeutic avenue to improve gap junctional
                    intercellular trafficking that is effective in the presence of high glucose
                    levels, oxidative stress and metabolic disturbances.

Involvement of different Cxs in many cell types during experimental diabetes
Dysfunction of any or all the three astrocytic Cxs (Cx43, Cx30 and Cx26), as well
                    as Cx-associated proteins, may contribute to the functional deficit of gap
                    junctional trafficking of small molecules during experimental diabetes and would
                    be anticipated to affect transcellular communication via channels that comprise
                    these Cxs in all body tissues, not just brain. Because Cx30 channels are not
                    permeable to LYCH (Manthey et al., 2001),
                    the abnormal transfer of Lucifer Yellow may involve Cx43 and Cx26 channels that
                    are permeant to this dye (Elfgang et al.,
                    1995). Cx43 may be a major ‘target’ of diabetes in
                    astrocytes, as well in other organs, as suggested by previous studies in other
                    cell types.

Gap junctional communication in a number of cell types is inhibited by growth in
                    high-glucose media ranging from 14 to 30 mmol/l for different intervals
                    (1–9 days) compared with cells grown in 5–5.5 mmol/l
                    glucose, and decrements have been documented in endothelial cells in the aorta
                        (Inoguchi et al., 1995, 2001), in the retina (Fernandes et al., 2004) and in epididymal fat pads (Sato et al., 2002; Li and Roy, 2009), in smooth muscle cells in aorta (Kuroki et al., 1998; Inoguchi et al., 2001), in pigment epithelial cells in
                    retina (Stalmans and Himpens, 1997; Malfait et al., 2001), and in pericytes in
                    retina (Li et al., 2003). These studies
                    have linked dye transfer deficits to altered PKC (protein kinase C) signalling,
                    increased phosphorylation of Cx43, reduced Cx43 mRNA and protein levels, low
                    Cx43 plaque counts, and increased proteosome-mediated degradation of Cx43.
                    Consistent with the above findings are reports that propagation of calcium waves
                    is inhibited in hyperglycaemic and PKC-activated retinal pigment epithelial
                    cells (Stalmans and Himpens, 1997), as
                    well as in PKC-activated astrocytes (Enkvist and
                        McCarthy, 1992). In STZ-diabetic rats, dye transfer is reduced in
                    acutely isolated pericytes in retinal microvessels after 5–18 days of
                    diabetes (Oku et al., 2001). Also, the
                    increased duration of QRS waves in electrocardiograms from STZ-diabetic rats is
                    associated with increased phosphorylation of Cx43 that is linked to activation
                    of PKC, with either unchanged or reduced Cx43 protein levels (Inoguchi et al., 2001; Lin et al., 2006, 2008; Howarth et al.,
                    2008). However, in coronary endothelial cells isolated from STZ-diabetic
                    mice, Cx40 is a critical element in loss of gap junction intercellular
                    communication; its levels are reduced, along with those of Cx37, but not Cx43,
                    and high glucose impairs capillary network formation in vitro
                        (Makino et al., 2008). Together, the
                    above findings indicate that gap junctional communication is abnormal in many
                    organ systems exposed to prolonged hyperglycaemia and experimental diabetes,
                    with tissue- and organ-specific effects. The brain is generally considered to be
                    affected by diabetes to a lesser extent than peripheral organs, but gap
                    junctional trafficking among astrocytes, retinal cells and endothelial cells is
                    markedly reduced.

Roles of gap junctions in pathophysiology of diabetes and
                    Alzheimer's disease
Gap junction-coupled astrocytes are involved in integration of neurotransmission,
                    energetics and blood flow at a local level, and impaired syncytial communication
                    by means of cytoplasmic signalling, redox and energy-related molecules can
                    contribute to brain dysfunction. For example, lack of
                        Ins(1,4,5)P3 signalling arising from mutations
                    in Cx26 in non-neuronal support cells in the cochlea is sufficient to cause
                    deafness (Beltramello et al., 2005),
                    indicating that a sensory loss associated with neurons can arise from
                    dysfunction of other cell types whose roles are required for processing of
                    sensory information. Gap junctions have important roles in regulation of
                    vascular function (Figueroa and Duling,
                    2009), and the brain's vasculature is surrounded by astrocytic
                    endfeet that are extensively coupled with each other by gap junctions that
                    facilitate long-distance dye transfer along the vasculature when dye is diffused
                    into a single astrocyte (Ball et al.,
                    2007). Thus it is likely that signals among cells within the
                    ‘neurovascular unit’ that comprises neurons, astrocytes
                    and endothelial cells would be disrupted by impairment of gap junctional
                    communication between astrocytic processes and their endfeet. As discussed
                    above, hyperglycaemia induces abnormalities in Cx proteins and signalling in
                    astrocytes, endothelial cells in different tissues, vascular smooth muscle
                    cells, and retinal pericytes. Microvascular pathology is common to diabetes and
                    Alzheimer's disease (Luchsinger and
                        Gustafson, 2009; Sonnen et al.,
                    2009), STZ-diabetic rats exhibit increased levels of amyloid
                    β-peptide and phosphorylated tau protein (Li et al., 2007), hyperglycaemia exacerbates
                    pathophysiological changes and cognitive decline in pre-symptomatic
                    Alzheimer's mice (Burdo et al.,
                    2009), and aged Alzheimer model mice have altered astrocytic networks
                        (Peters et al., 2009). Taken
                    together, these findings suggest that impairment of astrocytic gap junctional
                    trafficking may contribute to the pathology of the microvasculature in brain
                    and, ultimately, to sensory and cognitive decline in diabetes and
                    Alzheimer's disease. In addition, involvement of abnormalities in gap
                    junctional communication in vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells and
                    cardiac cells may underlie or contribute to complications of diabetes in the
                    cardiovascular system and other organs.
