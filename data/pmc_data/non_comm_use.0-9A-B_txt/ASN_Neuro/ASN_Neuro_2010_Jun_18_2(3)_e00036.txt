                    disease), many genetic mouse models have been generated. Each employs a unique
                    approach for delivery of the mutated gene and has a different CAG repeat length
                    and background strain. The resultant diversity in the genetic context and
                    phenotypes of these models has led to extensive debate regarding the relevance
                    of each model to the human disorder. Here, we compare and contrast the striatal
                    synaptic phenotypes of two models of HD, namely the YAC128 mouse, which carries
                    the full-length huntingtin gene on a yeast artificial chromosome, and the CAG140
                    KI (knock-in) mouse, which carries a human/mouse chimaeric gene that is
                    expressed in the context of the mouse genome, with our previously published data
                    obtained from the R6/2 mouse, which is transgenic for exon 1 mutant huntingtin.
                    We show that striatal MSNs (medium-sized spiny neurons) in YAC128 and CAG140 KI
                    mice have similar electrophysiological phenotypes to that of the R6/2 mouse.
                    These include a progressive increase in membrane input resistance, a reduction
                    in membrane capacitance, a lower frequency of spontaneous excitatory
                    postsynaptic currents and a greater frequency of spontaneous inhibitory
                    postsynaptic currents in a subpopulation of striatal neurons. Thus, despite
                    differences in the context of the inserted gene between these three models of
                    HD, the primary electrophysiological changes observed in striatal MSNs are
                    consistent. The outcomes suggest that the changes are due to the expression of
                    mutant huntingtin and such alterations can be extended to the human
                condition.

INTRODUCTION
Since the identification of the huntingtin gene (The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research
                    Group, 1993), many genetic models of HD (Huntington's disease)
                have been generated, ranging from transfected cells to invertebrates, rodents and,
                most recently, primates. The most studied of these are the mouse models of HD, which
                have been shown to replicate facets of the disorder (Bates et al., 2002; Hickey and
                    Chesselet, 2003; Levine et al.,
                2004). Mouse models have employed a number of different approaches for
                delivery of the mutant gene and a range of promoters to drive expression at various
                levels. In addition, experimenters have used either truncated or full-length DNA.
                The differences in genetic context and resultant phenotypes of these models have led
                to extensive debate regarding the consistency of outcomes and relevance to the human
                disorder. Often different research groups have chosen a preferred model in which to
                conduct experiments, and findings from different models are not systematically
                contrasted. In a comparative study, we recently reported that similar
                electrophysiological synaptic phenotypes were identifiable in cortical pyramidal
                neurons of three different mouse models of HD (Cummings et al., 2009). The first was the R6/2, the most widely studied
                mouse model of HD (Bates and Hockly, 2003;
                    Woodman et al., 2007), which expresses a
                truncated transgene consisting of exon 1 with ∼150 CAG repeats (Mangiarini et al., 1996). The second, the
                YAC128 mouse, carries the full-length HD gene on a yeast artificial chromosome
                    (Slow et al., 2003). The third model used
                a gene-targeting or KI (knock-in) approach to insert a chimaeric mouse/human exon 1
                containing 140 CAG repeats into the murine huntingtin homologue
                    (Hdh) and thus expresses the mutant HD gene in the normal
                context of the mouse genome (Menalled et al.,
                2003). We concluded that the basic cortical electrophysiological phenotype is
                consistent across these models and is likely to be true for the human disease.

In the present experiments, we compared electrophysiological alterations in synaptic
                transmission in striatal MSNs (medium-sized spiny neurons) in the same three models.
                Previously, we described progressive decreases in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs
                (excitatory postsynaptic currents) and increases in spontaneous IPSCs (inhibitory
                postsynaptic currents) in MSNs of both R6/2 and R6/1 mice (Cepeda et al., 2003, 2004). Here, we examined spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs in MSNs in the YAC128
                and CAG140 KI mice. We demonstrate that the progressive decrease in excitation and
                increase in inhibition also occur in these mouse models and therefore likely
                represent a striatal synaptic dysfunction in human HD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Mice were obtained from our colonies at the UCLA (University of California Los
                    Angeles). All procedures were performed in accordance with the USPHS
                        Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by
                    the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UCLA. Transgenic mice
                    containing the full-length human HD gene with 128 CAG repeats on a yeast
                    artificial chromosome (YAC128, line 53) (Slow et
                        al., 2003), maintained on an FVB/N background, were examined at 1, 6
                    and 12 months of age. KI mice had a chimaeric mouse/human exon 1 containing 140
                    CAG repeats inserted into the murine huntingtin gene (Menalled et al., 2003), maintained on a
                    mixed 129/SVXC57BL/6 background, were examined at 6, 12 and 18 months of age.
                    These ages were based on previous studies defining behavioural phenotypic
                    milestones in each of the lines (Slow et al.,
                        2003; Hickey et al., 2008).
                    Appropriate age-matched WT (wild-type) littermates were used as controls. Mice
                    were genotyped at least twice, once at weaning and again after experimentation,
                    to verify genotype. For all experiments, mice of both genders were used as there
                    were no consistent differences between measures obtained from males and
                females.

Slice preparation
Mice were anaesthetized using halothane and then decapitated, and the brain
                    rapidly removed to ice-cold dissection ACSF (artificial cerebrospinal fluid),
                    containing 130 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM
                    NaHPO4, 10 mM glucose, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM
                    CaCl2; aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2;
                    pH = 7.2; 290–300 mOsm/l. The
                    hindbrain was removed with a razor blade and glued by the caudal axis to the
                    stage of a vibrating microtome (model VT1000S; Leica), and 350 μm
                    coronal slices that included the striatum were cut. Slices were then stored and
                    allowed to recover at room temperature (25°C) in a submerged chamber
                    in oxygenated standard ACSF (the same composition as dissection ACSF, except
                    that MgCl2 and CaCl2 were 2 mM) for at least 1 h prior to
                    experimentation.

Whole-cell patch–clamp recordings
MSNs were visualized in the dorsolateral striatum using IR videomicroscopy and
                    differential interference contrast optics and identified by somatic size and
                    basic membrane properties. Whole-cell patch–clamp
                    recordings were made using glass micropipettes (electrode impedance
                    4–6 MΩ) filled with a caesium methanesulfonate-based
                    solution containing 125 mM caesium methanesulfonate, 4 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM
                        MgCl2, 9 mM EGTA, 8 mM Hepes, 5 mM MgATP, 1 mM Tris/GTP, 10 mM
                    disodium phosphocreatine and 0.1 mM leupeptin;
                    pH = 7.2; 270–280 mOsm/l. During
                    electrophysiological recordings, slices were continuously perfused in ACSF at a
                    flow rate of ∼2 ml/min at room temperature.

To record spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs, the membrane current was filtered at 1 kHz
                    and digitized at 100–200 μs using Clampex 8.2 (gap-free
                    mode) (Molecular Devices). Cells were voltage-clamped at −70 mV to
                    assess basic membrane properties and to examine glutamate receptor-mediated
                    EPSCs. Where indicated, 20 μM BIC (bicuculline methobromide) was
                    applied in order to block GABAA (γ-aminobutyric acid type
                    A) receptor-mediated currents. To isolate GABAA receptor-mediated
                    IPSCs, membranes were stepped to a holding potential of +10 mV and the
                    ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX
                    (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; 10 μM) and AP5
                    (dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid; 50 μM) were applied.
                    All drugs were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich. Stock
                    solutions were prepared in distilled water (or NaOH for AP5) and then dissolved
                    in ACSF to required concentrations.

Statistical analyses
Spontaneous EPSCs and IPSCs were analysed offline using the automatic detection
                    protocol within MiniAnalysis program (Justin Lee; Synaptosoft;
                    1999) and subsequently checked manually for accuracy. Event counts were carried
                    out by an experimenter blind to genotype. The threshold amplitude for the
                    detection of an event (5 pA for EPSCs and 10 pA for IPSCs) was set above the
                    root mean square noise (1–2 pA at
                    Vhold = −70
                    mV and 2–4 pA at
                    Vhold = +10 mV).
                    Event kinetics were analysed using MiniAnalysis software. Events with amplitudes
                    between 10 and 50 pA (EPSCs) and 15 and 70 pA (IPSCs) were aligned by half-rise
                    time and normalized by peak amplitude. Events displaying complex peaks were
                    excluded from this analysis. The decays of both EPSCs and IPSCs could be fitted
                    with second-order exponential curves, and these were used to determine rise
                    time, decay time and half-amplitude durations.

Values in the Figures are presented as means±S.E.M. Numerical values
                    for the estimated parameters and sample sizes are indicated within the Figures.
                    Differences between group means were assessed with appropriate
                    Student's t tests (two-tailed, unpaired with or
                    without Welch's correction for unequal variance) or appropriately
                    designed analyses of variance followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc test.
                    Microsoft Excel and SigmaStat 2.03 (SPSS) were used to perform all statistical
                    analyses.

RESULTS
Basic membrane properties of MSNs
The basic membrane properties of striatal MSNs have been shown to be
                    progressively altered in slices from R6/2 mice (Cepeda et al., 2001, 2004;
                        Klapstein et al., 2001). No
                    differences in input resistance or capacitance in MSNs of R6/2 mice were seen
                    prior to the onset of the overt motor phenotype, while MSNs from behaviourally
                    phenotypic mice showed increased input resistance and decreased capacitance. We
                    therefore assessed basic membrane properties in the YAC128 (Table 1) and CAG140 KI (Table 2) mice. At 1 and 6 months, no
                    differences in the input resistance of YAC128 MSNs and their respective WTs were
                    observed. By 12 months, however, a highly significant
                    (P<0.0001) increase in input resistance occurred. No
                    significant differences in membrane capacitance were observed at any age. MSNs
                    from the CAG140 KI mice showed no change in input resistance at 6 months but by
                    12 (P<0.01) and 18
                    (P<0.05) months, MSNs displayed input resistances
                    that were significantly increased compared with their respective WTs. KI mice
                    also showed a decrease in capacitance at 12 (P<0.05)
                    and 18 (P<0.01) months, but no difference at 6
                    months.

Spontaneous EPSCs
We next examined spontaneous EPSCs, which have been shown previously to have a
                    progressive decrease in frequency in MSNs of R6/2 and R6/1 mice with overt
                    phenotype progression (Cepeda et al.,
                    2003; Rossi et al., 2006). Similar
                    effects occurred in both the YAC128 and KI models (Figure 1). When cell membranes were voltage-clamped at
                    −70 mV and spontaneous currents recorded in ACSF (Figure 1A, left), YAC128 MSNs at 1 month
                    showed no difference in spontaneous EPSC frequency compared with their WT
                    counterparts. By 6 months, a significant reduction in frequency occurred in
                    YAC128 MSNs (P = 0.01 compared
                    with WT; P<0.01 compared with 1 month YAC128).
                    Further reductions were seen at 12 months (P<0.001
                    compared with WT; P<0.05 compared with 6 months
                    YAC128). Similar progressive decreases in EPSC frequency were observed in the
                    CAG140 KI mice (Figure 1A, right). No
                    difference in frequency was observed in CAG140 KI MSNs at 6 months compared with
                    WTs. By 12 months a significant reduction was evident
                    (P = 0.001 compared with WT;
                        P<0.001 compared with 6 months CAG140). This
                    reduction with respect to WTs was maintained at 18 months
                    (P<0.01 compared with WT).

                            **P<0.01 and
                            ***P<0.001.

Effects of BIC on spontaneous EPSCs
A proportion of the spontaneous currents recorded at −70 mV in
                    standard ACSF could be mediated by GABAA receptors and/or the
                    excitatory drive of presynaptic cortical and thalamic projection neurons could
                    be suppressed by inhibitory inputs from local interneurons. We applied the
                        GABAA receptor antagonist BIC (20 μM) to eliminate
                    these influences. Previously, in the R6/2 mice, we observed a reduction of
                    10–20% in spontaneous EPSC frequency in both genotypes (Cepeda et al., 2003). There was no
                    significant difference in the percentage change seen in WT compared with R6/2
                    mice and, moreover, the reduction in frequency was maintained. In the YAC128 and
                    KI mice, a different pattern occurred in response to BIC application (Figures 1B and 1C). In all cells from WTs,
                    there was a decrease in frequency of EPSCs in BIC. In YAC128 mice, however, some
                    cells responded with a decrease in frequency, while others responded with an
                    increase (Figures 1B and 1C, left panels).
                    At 1 month, only one of eight cells responded with an increase in frequency
                    after BIC treatment, and the overall outcome of BIC application was not
                    statistically different from that of WTs. At 6 months, 36% of cells responded
                    with an increase in EPSC frequency, but the overall outcome of BIC application
                    was still a decrease that was not significantly different from WTs. By 12
                    months, 75% of cells showed an increase after BIC application and the overall
                    outcome was a significant increase in EPSC frequency
                    (P<0.001). Despite the increase in EPSC frequencies
                    in response to BIC, the decrease in spontaneous EPSC frequency in YAC128 mice
                    compared with values in WTs still occurred at 6 and 12 months. At 6 months, the
                    effect was a trend that was not statistically significant
                    (P = 0.07), but it was
                    significant at 12 months (P<0.05).

This differential effect of BIC also occurred in MSNs of CAG140 KI mice (Figures 1B and 1C, right panels). At 6
                    months, in both WT and KI MSNs, BIC application resulted in a reduction in
                    frequency of EPSCs. At 12 months, 53% of CAG140 KI cells responded with an
                    increase in EPSC frequency and, similarly to the oldest group in the YAC128
                    mice, the overall effect of BIC did not reach statistical significance
                        (P = 0.06). Because of the
                    ∼25% decrease in frequency seen in WT MSNs and the ∼25%
                    increase seen in KI MSNs, the difference in mean EPSC frequency was not
                    maintained in the presence of BIC in this group of cells. Due to the technical
                    difficulties of recording from animals at 18 months of age, the effects of BIC
                    were not tested at this age in the CAG140 KI mice.

Spontaneous IPSCs
We reported previously that two populations of MSNs were identifiable in the R6/2
                    striatum. One population displayed an LF (low frequency) of IPSCs and was
                    indistinguishable from WTs. The other population displayed an HF (high
                    frequency) of IPSCs, which were never seen in WTs (Cepeda et al., 2004). When IPSCs were isolated at a holding
                    membrane potential of +10 mV in the presence of the ionotropic glutamate
                    receptor antagonists CNQX (10 μM) and AP5 (50 μM), two
                    populations of MSNs were again observed in YAC128 and CAG140 MSNs (Figure 2). At all ages in the YAC128 mice
                        (Figure 2, left), a small population of
                    MSNs with an HF of IPSCs (P<0.001 compared with WT)
                    was identified, but only in transgenic mice. Unlike the R6/2, a progressive
                    difference was also observed in the LF population of cells. At 1 month, the mean
                    frequency of LF IPSCs in YAC128 was identical with WTs. At 6 and 12 months,
                    however, there was a significant reduction in frequency in the LF population of
                    cells compared with WTs (P<0.01 at both 6 and 12
                    months).

Typical recordings from YAC128 at 6 months and CAG140 KI at 12 months.
                            Two populations of cells were identified in mutant animals only. One
                            displayed LF IPSCs and the other HF IPSCs. IPSCs were isolated at a
                            holding potential of +10 mV and in the presence of CNQX and AP5. Results
                            show mean frequencies±S.E.M. for each age. Statistical
                            significance with respect to WTs is indicated by
                            **P<0.01 and
                            ***P<0.001.

The changes in IPSCs were less pronounced and transitory in the CAG140 KI mice
                        (Figure 2, right-hand panel). At 6
                    months, no differences in the frequency of IPSCs, including no cells with HF
                    IPSCs, were observed. At 12 months, both LF and HF cells were identified.
                    Similar to the YAC128 mice, the LF population of cells showed a lower frequency
                    of IPSCs than WTs (P<0.05). Very few HF cells were
                    observed (3/18 cells), but these showed a highly significant increase in
                    frequency compared with WTs (P<0.001). At 18 months,
                    the LF population of cells maintained a reduction compared with WTs
                    (P<0.05), but no HF cells were observed in the cells
                    sampled.

Event kinetics
When the kinetics of averaged spontaneous EPSCs were analysed in R6/2 MSNs, we
                    observed no differences in rise time, decay time or half-amplitude duration for
                    any age (Cepeda et al., 2003). In
                    contrast, Milnerwood and Raymond (2007)
                    demonstrated faster spontaneous EPSC decay kinetics in MSNs of YAC128 mice at 1
                    month. In our hands, at this age no differences in EPSC kinetics between WT and
                    YAC128 neurons were observed (Figure 3A,
                    left panels). At 6 and 12 months, a faster decay time of EPSCs was observed
                        (P<0.01 and P<0.05
                    respectively). Rise time and half-amplitude duration were unaltered at any age.
                    No differences in the EPSC kinetics of 6 or 12 month CAG140 KI mice were
                    identified (Figure 3A, right panels). At 18
                    months of age, cells from these animals had EPSCs with faster decay times
                        (P<0.05).

                            EPSCs and Figure 2 for IPSCs.
                            Statistical significance is indicated by
                            *P<0.05,
                            **P<0.01 and
                            ***P<0.001 with respect to WT.

We also examined the kinetics of spontaneous IPSCs. In the LF and HF populations
                    of R6/2 MSNs, IPSCs were found to have faster decay times (Cepeda et al., 2004) and this effect was also observed in
                    the two lines of mice studied here (Figure
                    3B). At 1 month of age, IPSCs in the LF population of YAC128 cells (Figure 3B, left panels) had a faster decay
                    time (P<0.05). The faster decay time in the HF
                    population of cells did not reach statistical significance. Half-amplitude
                    duration did not show significant differences at this age. By 6 months, both the
                    LF (P<0.01) and HF
                    (P<0.05) populations had IPSCs with faster decay
                    times and shorter half-amplitude durations, an effect that was maintained at 12
                    months (P<0.05 to
                    P<0.001). In the CAG140 KI mice (Figure 3B, right panels), only the HF
                    population of cells at 12 months showed altered IPSC kinetics. In this group of
                    cells, both decay time and half-amplitude duration were reduced
                    (P<0.05).

DISCUSSION
The present experiments demonstrate that both YAC128 and CAG140 KI mouse models of HD
                show similar alterations in basic membrane properties and both spontaneous EPSCs and
                IPSCs to those observed previously in the R6/2 and R6/1 models of HD (Cepeda et al., 2003, 2004; Cummings et al.,
                2009). The reduction in EPSC frequency has also been confirmed by others in
                the R6/2 mouse and the neurotoxic 3-nitropropionic acid rat model of HD (Rossi et al., 2006). Spontaneous EPSCs were
                also studied by Milnerwood and Raymond (2007)
                in MSNs of the YAC128 mouse at 1 month of age and, similar to our results, no
                differences in EPSC frequency were identified, although there were changes in EPSC
                kinetics. Here, we extend the striatal data in YAC128 to 12 months and CAG140 KI
                mice to 18 months, demonstrating a reduction in EPSC frequency. Similarly, a
                reduction in spontaneous EPSCs has been observed at 6 months in a model of HD in
                which full-length human huntingtin is carried on a bacterial artificial chromosome
                with 97 mixed CAA-CAG repeats (Gray et al.,
                2008). Similar to the present dataset, the cortical electrophysiological
                phenotype was demonstrated to be common to each of the R6/2, YAC128 and CAG140 KI
                mouse models of HD (Cummings et al., 2009).

MSNs receive a major excitatory drive from the cortex, in which pyramidal neurons
                from almost the whole cortical mantle, but in particular the motor and somatosensory
                cortices, project to the striatum (Bolam et al.,
                2000). Therefore the reduction in EPSC frequency probably represents a
                disconnection between the cortex and striatum, which is likely to be mediated by the
                loss of spines and the presence of dysmorphic neuronal processes characteristic of
                both cortical and striatal neurons in HD (Klapstein
                    et al., 2001). Thalamostriatal projections also provide an excitatory
                input on to MSNs (Ding et al., 2008; Smeal et al., 2008). Corticostriatal and
                thalamostriatal terminals appear to be equal in number in non-disease states (Lacey et al., 2005) and may synapse on to
                distinct populations of MSNs (Dubé et
                    al., 1988) and excitatory synapses formed by corticostriatal and
                thalamostriatal projections have differential electrophysiological properties (Ding et al., 2008; Smeal et al., 2008). However, the properties of neurons within
                the thalamic nuclei or their influences on striatal neurons have yet to be
                determined in HD.

There were commonalities and differences in GABAergic neurotransmission between the
                three models of HD. All showed two populations of cells, one with LF IPSCs and one
                with HF IPSCs. No difference was observed between the LF IPSCs in the R6/2 mouse
                compared with WTs (Cepeda et al., 2004). In
                contrast, in both the YAC128 and CAG140 KI mice there were reductions in frequency
                compared with their respective WTs for this population of cells. Whereas the change
                in glutamatergic neurotransmission probably reflects alterations in corticostriatal
                (and thalamostriatal) connections, the alterations in GABAergic currents reflect
                abnormal synaptic transmission local to the striatum. MSNs receive a major
                inhibitory drive from striatal interneurons (Tepper
                    et al., 2004, 2008; Plotkin et al., 2005) and it is therefore
                likely that dysfunctional, fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons underlie the changes
                observed in inhibitory currents in MSNs. Altered MSN–MSN interactions may
                also be of importance, as these neurons receive inputs from other MSNs via both
                electrical (gap junction) and chemical (synaptic) connections (Wilson and Groves, 1980; Venance et al., 2004), although their importance relative to
                fast-spiking interneuronal inputs is still debated (Tunstall et al., 2002; Czubayko and
                    Plenz, 2002). Furthermore, connectivity between interneurons has been
                shown to affect both excitatory and inhibitory inputs to MSNs, as knockout of the
                neuronal gap junction gene for connexin 36 leads to reductions in both EPSC and IPSC
                frequency (Cummings et al., 2008). An altered
                connexin 43 expression pattern has been demonstrated in post-mortem HD brain (Vis et al., 1998). While the connexin 43
                subunit is associated with the coupling of astrocytes, if changes in the neuronal
                connexin 36 occur in HD, altered interneuronal synchrony is likely to result.

The influence of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition on EPSCs was altered
                differentially in the YAC128 and CAG140 mice, a finding contrary to that in the R6/2
                mouse model (Cepeda et al., 2003). In R6/2
                (and WT) mice, application of a GABAA receptor antagonist reduced the
                frequency of events recorded at a holding potential of −70 mV, suggesting
                that a proportion of these events were GABAergic in origin. In contrast, in MSNs
                from YAC128, a higher proportion of cells responded with an increase in frequency
                upon GABAA receptor blockade as animals aged. This was also observed at
                12 months in MSNs from CAG140 KIs. Such an effect may be due to altered inhibition
                within the striatum, which may be shunting excitatory inputs received from the
                cortical and thalamic terminals. Alternatively, cortical pyramidal cells are known
                to be hyperexcitable in the R6/2, YAC128 and CAG140 KI models of HD (Walker et al., 2008; Cummings et al., 2009). Application of BIC to the
                corticostriatal slices may thus exacerbate the hyperexcitability of cortical cells,
                leading to increased release of glutamate, reflected in MSNs as increased EPSC
                frequency.

The rate of progression of the electrophysiological phenotypes varied between the
                different models (Figure 4). This divergence is
                likely to be due to a combination of the precise regulation of the huntingtin gene
                expressed in the alternative models and cumulative compensatory mechanisms, which
                may be more prevalent in the slower onset models. Differences in EPSC frequency were
                detectable as early as 40 days in the R6/2 model, while no differences were detected
                until 6 months in the YAC128 and only at 1 year in the CAG140 KI. These effects
                correspond to previous reports of phenotypic progression in the YAC128 and KI lines.
                The finding that no difference in EPSC frequency was observed at the youngest ages
                in any line of HD mouse models suggests that presymptomatic HD gene carriers are
                likely to have more normal excitatory inputs to MSNs. In contrast, IPSC frequency
                increased in a population of cells in the youngest age group of YAC128 mice and a
                trend towards an increase in IPSC frequency was evident in R6/2 mice (Cepeda et al., 2004), but no difference was
                observed in CAG140 mice. This suggests that alterations in inhibitory inputs
                probably from fast-spiking interneurons within the striatum are affected at a much
                earlier stage than the excitatory inputs received by MSNs from cortical and thalamic
                projections. Furthermore, our previous data suggest that a cortical
                electrophysiological dysfunction may occur earlier than observed in the striatum and
                that the predominant cortical phenotype is an alteration in GABAergic
                neurotransmission (Cummings et al., 2009). As
                interneurons are relatively spared in HD (Ferrante
                    et al., 1985), there has yet to be a systematic electrophysiological
                examination of striatal interneurons in an HD mouse model to determine whether and
                how they are dysfunctional.

Figure 4 Timeline of key phenotypes including striatal and cortical
                        electrophysiology
Age in days and months are indicated within the arrows. Each phenotype is
                        indicated such that the labels begin at the earliest age detected. Timelines
                        are shown for R6/2 (top), YAC128 (middle) and CAG140 KI (bottom) with key
                        behavioural, cognitive and morphological phenotypes (green bars), as well as
                        cortical (beige bars) and striatal (blue bars) electrophysiological
                        phenotypes. Upward arrows indicate increases or improvements; downward
                        arrows indicate decreases or deficits. Electrophysiological striatal and
                        cortical phenotypes are summarized from the present paper and from Cummings et al. (2009) and Cepeda et al. (2003, 2004). Behavioural, cognitive and
                        morphological phenotypes are from Lione et
                            al. (1999), Meade et al.
                        (2002), Hickey et al. (2008),
                            Menalled et al. (2003), Van Raamsdonk et al. (2005) and Slow et al. (2003).

The differences that we identified between the models included altered EPSC kinetics,
                an altered effect of GABAA receptor blockade on EPSC frequency, and a
                reduced frequency of IPSCs in a subpopulation of cells in YAC128 and CAG140 KI mice
                that were not observed in R6/2 mice. These differences may suggest that these
                alterations require the full-length mutant huntingtin to occur or may reflect the
                presence of the transgene over a protracted period of time and would therefore not
                be observed in the R6/2 mouse that reaches end stage at approx. 3–4
                months of age. It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that the disparate finding
                observed in R6/2, YAC128 and CAG140 mice may represent differences between adult-
                and juvenile-onset HD. Notwithstanding these differences, the predominant synaptic
                phenotype was consistently observed across models. Recently, an in
                vivo study of striatal MSNs showed reduced bursts of HF activity and a loss
                of synchrony in both the R6/2 and CAG140 KI mice (Miller et al., 2008). Also, the R6/2 mouse and a KI mouse carrying 150
                CAG repeats showed consistent changes in molecular phenotypes when background strain
                and disease progression were taken into account (Woodman et al., 2007). Therefore it appears that the precise HD gene
                construct does not significantly alter the basic electrophysiological phenotypes
                observed in the cortex (Cummings et al., 2009)
                and striatum.

In conclusion, we demonstrate that a full-length model (YAC128) and a targeted model
                (CAG140 KI) of HD display similar basic striatal electrophysiological phenotypes to
                the R6/2 mouse, namely a decrease in EPSC and an increase in IPSC frequencies in
                striatal MSNs. The consistency of these phenotypes across different mouse models of
                HD suggests that these changes are a result of the mutant huntingtin gene rather
                than being idiosyncratic to a particular model.
