conclusion from these studies was that cultured glutamatergic neurons utilize
glucose rather than lactate during NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate)-induced
synaptic activity and that lactate alone is not able to support neurotransmitter
glutamate homoeostasis. Subsequently, a model was proposed to explain these
results at the cellular level. In brief, the intermittent rises in intracellular
Ca2+ during activation cause influx of Ca2+ into the
mitochondrial matrix thus activating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenases.
This will lead to a lower activity of the MASH (malate–aspartate shuttle),
which in turn will result in anaerobic glycolysis and lactate production rather
than lactate utilization. In the present work, we have investigated the effect
of an ionomycin-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ (i.e. independent
of synaptic activity) on neuronal energy metabolism employing 13C-labelled
glucose and lactate and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis of labelling
in glutamate, alanine and lactate. The results demonstrate that glucose utilization
is positively correlated with intracellular Ca2+ whereas lactate
utilization is not. This result lends further support for a significant role
of glucose in neuronal bioenergetics and that Ca2+ signalling may
control the switch between glucose and lactate utilization during synaptic
activity. Based on the results, we propose a compartmentalized CiMASH (Ca2+-induced
limitation of the MASH) model that includes intracellular compartmentation
of glucose and lactate metabolism. We define pre- and post-synaptic compartments
metabolizing glucose and glucose plus lactate respectively in which the latter
displays a positive correlation between oxidative metabolism of glucose and
Ca2+ signalling.

INTRODUCTION
The main energy substrate for the brain is undoubtedly glucose, but whether
glucose itself or glucose-derived lactate produced by nearby astrocytes is
the preferred energy substrate for glutamatergic neurons during activation
has been debated in recent years (for a recent review, see Dienel, 2011). The astrocyte–neuron lactate shuttle
hypothesis suggests that during brain activation, astrocytes metabolize blood–borne
glucose to lactate, which is then released and metabolized by nearby glutamatergic
neurons during activation (Pellerin and Magistretti,
1994; Pellerin et al., 2007).
Lactate is beyond any doubt an important (energy) substrate for neurons both in
vitro and in vivo; most recently, it has been suggested
that neuronal metabolism of (astrocyte-derived) lactate is important for memory
formation (Newman et al., 2011; Suzuki et al., 2011); however, neurons in
vivo may consume as much as 65% of the interstitial glucose (Zielke et al., 2007). We have previously
shown that mouse cerebellar (glutamatergic) neurons in culture metabolize
lactate avidly; however, utilization of glucose but not that of lactate was
increased during NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate)-induced
synaptic activity and, furthermore, lactate alone was not able to support
neurotransmitter homoeostasis in these cells (Bak
et al., 2006). Since synaptic activity is associated with an increase
in the [Ca2+]i (intracellular concentration of Ca2+),
a central regulator of key metabolic processes, we have previously proposed
a model (Bak et al., 2009) in which
Ca2+, after entry into the mitochondrial matrix, partially inhibits
(i.e. limits the maximal activity) the MASH (malate–aspartate shuttle).
This shuttle is believed to be of crucial importance for net transport of
reducing equivalents across the inner mitochondrial membrane (McKenna et al., 2006). Such limitation of MASH activity increases
cytosolic NADH and favours production of lactate and consumption of glucose
via anaerobic glycolysis whereas utilization of lactate would be repressed.
When the level of [Ca2+]i returns to resting levels
between action potentials, the MASH would be reactivated causing a decrease
in cytosolic NADH and both glucose and lactate may then be metabolized. The
net result of this is that utilization of glucose increases with synaptic
activity [see Figure 1 and Bak et al. (2009) for further details]. In the following,
we will refer to this model as the CiMASH (Ca2+-induced limitation
of the MASH) model. The previous work (Bak
et al., 2006, 2009) was performed
by inducing synaptic activity employing pulses of NMDA. In the present work,
we aimed to investigate the effect of an isolated increase in [Ca2+]i
(i.e. independent of synaptic activity) on neuronal utilization of glucose
and lactate. To this end, we incubated cultured mouse cerebellar neurons [CCNs
(cultured cerebellar neurons)] in the presence of [U-13C]glucose
(2.5 mM), [U-13C]lactate (1.0 mM), and the combined presence of
both substrates with only one of them labelled. Intracellular [Ca2+]
was titrated employing ionomycin, and 13C labelling in intracellular
glutamate, alanine and lactate was analysed by MS. The results suggest that
utilization of glucose correlates positively with increasing [Ca2+]i,
whereas lactate shows no such correlation; this indicates that intracellular
Ca2+ signalling in neurons promotes utilization of glucose as energy
substrate.

involved in regulation of glucose (glc) and lactate (lac) metabolism during
neuronal depolarization and (B) the dynamics of glucose and lactate
metabolism during re-polarization and at resting membrane potential. (C)
A schematic depiction of cytosolic Ca2+ dynamics during neuronal
spiking; arrows indicate when the CiMASH mechanism is operating. During neuronal
depolarization (A), [Ca2+]i is increased
via flux of Ca2+ through NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+
channels (VGCC) subsequently inducing release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER,
1). This triggers accumulation of Ca2+ in the mitochondrial matrix
(2) and activation of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH, 3), which
competes with the malate/α-ketoglutarate carrier (MKC) for substrate thus
limiting efflux of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG, 4). This leads to less α-ketoglutarate
being available for the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (AATc) reaction
(5) in turn limiting activity of cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDHc) and
thus re-oxidation of cytosolic NADH (6). The increased cytosolic [NADH] together
with decreased [ATP] will activate anaerobic glycolysis leading to lactate
synthesis via the LDH reaction and re-oxidation of NADH (7). During this period,
oxidation of lactate will be limited because of the increased [NADH] (8, 9).
(B) During neuronal re-polarization and in the period between
depolarizations where [Ca2+]i is low and MASH activity
is restored, cytosolic [NAD+] will increase again. In conjunction
with the increased [lactate] formed by anaerobic glycolysis, this will limit
formation of lactate via the LDH reaction (10) whereas the opposite reaction
is now favoured (11). The net effect at this point is formation of pyruvate
(pyr) from glucose-derived lactate as well as extracellular lactate. Thus,
extracellular lactate is only consumed during rest whereas glucose fuels the
energy needed during neuronal depolarization. This latter part is now revised
in the present paper (see Figure 8).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Seven-day-old NMRI mice were acquired from Taconic M&B. Plastic culture
flasks were purchased from NUNC A/S. Corning cellBIND surface 96-well plates
as well as culture medium, poly-d-lysine (Mw>300
kg/mol), ionomycin, MTBSTFA (N-tertbutyl-dimethylsilyl-N-methyltrifluoroacetamide)
containing 1% tertbutyl-dimethylchlorosilane were from Sigma–Aldrich.
Fetal calf serum was purchased from Seralab Ltd, [U-13C]glucose
and [U-13C]lactate from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories and penicillin
from Leo Pharma. Fura 2/AM (fura 2 acetoxymethyl ester) was obtained from
Invitrogen A/S. All other chemicals were of the purest grade available from
regular commercial sources.

Cell culture
Primary cultures of murine cerebellar granule (glutamatergic) neurons (CCNs)
were prepared as described previously (Schousboe
et al., 1989). Briefly, cerebellum was excised from 7-day-old animals.
The tissue was finely chopped, subjected to a gentle trypsinization (0.25
mg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 37°C) and triturated in a solution containing
DNase [75 i.u. (international units)/ml] and trypsin inhibitor (0.53 mg/ml).
The resulting cells were suspended in a modified Dulbecco's medium containing
24.5 mM KCl, 12 mM glucose, 7 μM p-aminobenzoate, 50 μM kainate and
10% (v/v) fetal calf serum to a total concentration of 2.75×106
cells/ml and seeded in poly-d-lysine coated 25 cm2 culture
flasks (5 ml per flask) or to a total concentration of 2.5×106
cells/ml for seeding in poly-d-lysine coated 96-well plates (100 μl
per well). The cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 at 37°C and employed for experiments after 7–8 days in
vitro. In order to prevent astrocyte proliferation, cytosine arabinoside
was added to a final concentration of 20 μM after 48 h in culture. Moreover,
glucose was supplemented twice during culturing to ensure a minimum concentration
of 12 mM. The presence of kainate blocks functional development of the subpopulation
of GABAergic neurons (Drejer and Schousboe,
1989; Sonnewald et al., 2004, 2006) and its combination with cytosine arabinoside
results in cultures containing 80–90% neurons exhibiting glutamatergic
characteristics. Animals were handled according to Danish law and university
policy under which no ethical approval is needed for the work carried out
in this project.

Measurement of relative intracellular Ca2+ levels
The [Ca2+]i response to increasing concentrations
of ionomycin was measured using the ratiometric Ca2+ probe fura-2
(Grynkiewicz et al., 1985). Cerebellar
neurons seeded in 96-well plates were loaded by adding 5.2 μM fura-2/AM
to the culture medium and incubating for 45 min in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. The cells were washed once with
a Tris-buffered saline solution (15 mM Tris/HCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 140
mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose and 1.2 mM Na2PO4,
pH 7.4) and left at room temperature (20°C) for 5 min to ensure complete
de-esterification. The cultures were then incubated in a buffer identical
with the Tris-buffered saline solution plus 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 0.75 μM ionomycin
for 30 min. During both the de-esterification period and the experiment 10 μM
of MK-801 and 30 μM verapamil were present in order to eliminate contributions
from NMDA receptor stimulation (from any transmitter glutamate released due
to the elevated [Ca2+]i) and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+
channels respectively. Employing a NOVOstar plate reader (BMG LABTECH GmbH),
fura-2 was λex at 340 and 380 nm and the resulting λem
was measured at 510 nm. All filters used had a bandwidth of 10 nm and the
experimental temperature was 32°C. The results are calculated as the ratio
of fluorescence from λex at 340 and 380 nm after background
subtraction after 30 min of incubation. The data represent two batches of
cerebellar neurons with 15 repetitions in total for each condition.

Metabolic experiments
Cultures of cerebellar neurons seeded in 25 cm2 flasks were
washed twice with warm PBS (37°C; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 7.3 mM Na2HPO4,
1.5 mM KH2PO4, 0.9 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM MgCl2,
pH 7.4) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C in serum-free culture medium containing
either 2.5 mM [U-13C]glucose in the presence or absence of 1.0
mM unlabelled lactate (conditions A and C respectively) or 1.0 mM [U-13C]lactate
in the presence or absence of 2.5 mM unlabelled glucose (conditions B and
D respectively) as substrates. In order to titrate [Ca2+]i,
increasing concentrations of ionomycin (0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 μM) were
present during the last 30 min in combination with 10 μM MK-801 and 30 μM
verapamil. Some cultures were placed in a superfusion apparatus and superfused
(4 ml/min) in a Hepes-buffered medium (5 mM Hepes, 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
1.8 mM CaCl2 and 2.5 mM glucose, pH 7.4, 37°C; MK-801 and verapamil
were not present in these experiments) for 10 min at which time the medium
was switched to one containing 2.5 mM [U-13C]glucose in place of
the unlabelled glucose and superfused for an additional 50 min. Ten 30-s pulses
(4 min intervals) of NMDA (100 μM) and glycine (10 μM) were included
in some cultures to induce neurotransmission activity (Bak et al., 2003). The medium was collected in fractions (12
ml corresponding to 3 min) for determination of lactate release. After the
experiments, the cultures were extracted using 70% ethanol and the resulting
isotopic enrichment in intracellular glutamate, alanine and lactate was determined
using GC-MS.

Analytical chemistry and analysis of labelling data
Freeze-dried cell extracts were dissolved in water and an aliquot was dried
under atmospheric air. The metabolites were extracted into an organic phase
of ethanol and benzene and dried again before derivatization with MTBSTFA
containing 1% tertbutyl-dimethylchlorosilane in DMF (dimethylformamide; Mawhinney et al., 1986). The samples were
analysed using a Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Plus system (Shimadzu Corp.) equipped
with a Zebron-5MS column from Phenomenex. Percent isotopic enrichment of glutamate,
alanine and lactate was determined after correcting for naturally abundant 13C
as described by Biemann (1962).

Details on labelling of glutamate, alanine and lactate from [U-13C]glucose
and [U-13C]lactate are available elsewhere (e.g. Bak et al., 2006) and the labelling in glutamate is presented
as percentage MCL (molecular carbon labelling) as explained in Bak et al. (2006). In short, the MCL value is an average of
the percentage 13C labelling in a given metabolite. For instance,
an MCL value of 20% means that 20% of all carbon atoms in the glutamate pool
are 13C. Since incorporation of 13C into alanine arises
through rapid transamination of pyruvate and as such reflects labelling in
this metabolite, both syntheses of pyruvate from lactate and glucose contribute
to the average molecular labelling. Hence, the percentage M+3 (i.e. the 12C
monoisotopic mass plus three) for alanine indicates the direct conversion
of uniformly labelled glucose or lactate into alanine through pyruvate and
is therefore presented here. Likewise, lactate labelling should be presented
as percentage M+3. However, due to a constant contamination of the lactate
signal on the GC-MS from the derivatization reagent, the percentage M+3 values
for lactate are presented as percentage of control within each batch of neurons.

In order to obtain information on tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, CRs
(cycling ratios) were calculated based on labelling in glutamate according
to the following formula: ([M+1]+[M+3]+[M+4]+[M+5]/[M+2]), i.e. the labelling
occurring in two or more turns of the tricarboxylic acid cycle divided by
the labelling occurring after the first turn (see Bak
et al., 2006 for details).

The amount of lactate released to the media during superfusion of CCNs
was quantified as previously detailed by Lund
et al. (2011). Briefly, the collected superfusion media were freeze-dried
and re-dissolved in water. Black microtitre plates were used for conversion
of lactate present in the sample by LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). In this reaction,
NAD+ is concomitantly reduced to NADH that can be detected due
to its autofluorescence (350 and 455 nm as λex and λem
respectively). In order for the reaction to be stoichiometric, pyruvate formed
from lactate was further transaminated to alanine by alanine aminotransferase
in the presence of glutamate. l-Lactate was used as a standard.

The results are presented as means±S.E.M. Data were compared by
Student's t test or one-way ANOVA followed by either
Bonferroni (<5 groups) or Tukey–Kramer (≥5 groups) post
hoc tests. A P-value of 0.05 or less was considered
statistically significant. Data were analysed employing Microsoft Excel 2010
and GraphPad Prism 5 software.

RESULTS
Titration of intracellular Ca2+
Ionomycin, which is commonly employed as a Ca2+ ionophore to
elevate [Ca2+]i (Liu
and Hermann, 1978; Nicholls, 2006),
was used to titrate [Ca2+]i in CCNs. The ratio of fura-2
fluorescence intensity measured at 510 nm after λex at 340
and 380 nm increased significantly in the measured range of ionomycin concentrations
(Figure 2), indicating that ionomycin
may be employed as a tool to investigate the metabolic response to increasing
levels of [Ca2+]i.

Figure 2 Effect of ionomycin on the intracellular Ca2+ concentration
Cultures of cerebellar neurons were exposed to increasing concentrations
of ionomycin for 30 min and the resulting effect on the intracellular Ca2+
concentration was measured employing the ratiometric Ca2+ sensitive
dye fura-2. The results are displayed as the ratio of emitted light at 550
nm after λex at 340 and 380 nm and each bar represents the
means±S.E.M. Data were obtained from two individual batches of cerebellar
neurons with 14–15 repetitions in total for each condition. a, b, c,
d and e denotes differences from 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8 μM ionomycin
respectively (one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey–Kramer post hoc
test). Ionomycin dose-dependently increases the intracellular Ca2+
concentration.

As discussed by Nicholls (2006),
ionomycin will not only facilitate Ca2+ entry across the plasma
membrane but also be embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (and other
internal membranes) inducing Ca2+ fluxes across the mitochondrial
inner membrane as well; this may lead to Ca2+ deregulation in cultured
cells including cultured neurons. However, this effect is both time- and concentration-dependent
and primarily observed at ionomycin concentrations above 1 μM (Nicholls, 2006). Still, it should be mentioned that even
at the levels of ionomycin employed in this study, there might be a direct
effect on bioenergetics since Ca2+ cycling across the inner mitochondrial
membrane is linked to the proton gradient (Nicholls,
2006). The present work demonstrates that it is possible to employ
ionomycin to dose-dependently manipulate [Ca2+]i levels
in CCNs making ionomycin a valuable tool to study the metabolic consequences
of Ca2+ signalling independent of neuronal depolarization. It should
be mentioned that both the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials might
be affected by ionomycin; however, based on the work by Nicholls (2006) we conclude that at the exposure time and
concentration of ionomycin employed in the present work, the effects on these
parameters as well as induction of Ca2+ deregulation are minimal.

Metabolic experiments
CCNs were incubated for 1 h in the presence of [U-13C]glucose
(2.5 mM) and lactate (1 mM; panel A in Figures
3–6); [U-13C]lactate and glucose (panel
B), [U-13C]glucose (panel C) or [U-13C]lactate (panel
D) followed by 30 min in the additional presence of increasing concentrations
of ionomycin (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 μM). The resulting 13C labelling
was analysed by MS (see the Materials and methods section) in intracellular
glutamate (Figure 3), alanine (Figure 4) and lactate (Figure 5). In the presence of unlabelled lactate, ionomycin-dependent
increases in 13C labelling from [U-13C]glucose were
observed in glutamate, alanine and lactate (panel A in Figures 3–5 respectively). Since glutamate is in rapid
equilibrium with tricarboxylic acid cycle-derived (13C-labelled) α-ketoglutarate
under these conditions (Berkich et al., 2005),
the increase in glutamate labelling suggests that glycolysis plus tricarboxylic
acid cycle activity is up-regulated by ionomycin. Labelling in alanine reflects
labelling in the associated pyruvate pool derived from either glucose (via
glycolysis) or lactate (via the LDH reaction). Thus, the ionomycin-dependent
increase in alanine M+3 (Figure 4A) in
combination with the increase in [U-13C]glucose-derived lactate
M+3 (Figure 5A) reflects increased glycolysis
under these conditions. In the presence of [U-13C]lactate and unlabelled
glucose, ionomycin-dependent decreases in 13C-labelling were observed
in glutamate (Figure 3B) and alanine
(Figure 4B), but not lactate (Figure 5B). This suggests that extracellular lactate is metabolized
independently of ionomycin-induced effects on [Ca2+]i
and glycolysis and that the decrease in labelling in glutamate and alanine
reflects increased synthesis of glucose-derived pyruvate. In the presence
of [U-13C]glucose as the sole substrate, the labelling in glutamate
(Figure 3C) was higher than when unlabelled
lactate was present (compare with Figure 3A).
This indicates that the (labelled) pyruvate pool is diluted by unlabelled
lactate or in other words that extracellular lactate is metabolized to a significant
extent even in the presence of glucose. Interestingly, labelling in alanine
was not affected by ionomycin (Figure 4C),
which was in contrast with lactate that showed a rather large relative response
(Figure 5C). Thus, in the presence of
glucose only, labelled lactate is being generated from a pyruvate pool in
which the labelling (via glycolytic activity) is strongly dependent on ionomycin-induced
increases in [Ca2+]i; however, this pool is so small
that it is not evident from the labelling in the bulk pyruvate pool reflected
by labelling in alanine. When [U-13C]lactate was the only substrate
available, labelling in both glutamate and (intracellular) lactate was not
affected by ionomycin whereas labelling in alanine showed decreases (Figures 3D, 5D
and 4D, respectively). This might indicate
that tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism of lactate-derived carbon is unaffected
by ionomycin; however, the drop in alanine labelling is not easily explained.

Figure 3 Effect of ionomycin on 13C-labelling from [U-13C]glucose
and [U-13C]lactate into intracellular glutamate
Cultures of cerebellar neurons were incubated for 1 h with either 2.5 mM
[U-13C]glucose in the presence or absence of 1 mM unlabelled lactate
(A and C respectively) or 1 mM [U-13C]lactate
in the presence or absence of 2.5 mM unlabelled glucose (B and D
respectively) as substrates. In order to titrate the intracellular Ca2+
level, increasing concentrations of ionomycin (0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 μM)
were present during the last 30 min of incubation in combination with 10 μM
MK-801 and 30 μM verapamil. The resulting 13C-enrichment in
intracellular glutamate was determined by GC-MS. The results are displayed
as percentage MCL, which is a measure of the average 13C-labelling
of a given metabolite. The data were obtained from 2 to 4 individual batches
of cerebellar neurons with 5–14 repetitions in total for each condition
and the bars represent means±S.E.M. Significant differences (P<0.05,
one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test)
from 0 and 0.25 μM ionomycin are indicated by a and b, respectively. 13C-Labelling
from glucose into glutamate is enhanced by ionomycin-induced increased intracellular
Ca2+ concentration both in the presence and absence of lactate
(A and C respectively). This signifies increased
glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity since glutamate is in rapid
equilibrium with the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate.
In contrast, 13C-labelling from lactate is decreased by ionomycin
in the presence but not in the absence of glucose (B and D
respectively). Collectively these results indicate that extracellular lactate
is metabolized independently of Ca2+-induced effects on glycolysis
and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, the latter causing dilution of 13C-labelling
from increased metabolism of unlabelled glucose when present.

Figure 4 Effect of ionomycin on 13C-labelling from [U-13C]glucose
and [U-13C]lactate into intracellular alanine
Cultures of cerebellar neurons were incubated for 1 h with either 2.5 mM
[U-13C]glucose in the presence or absence of 1 mM unlabelled lactate
(A and C respectively) or 1 mM [U-13C]lactate
in the presence or absence of 2.5 mM unlabelled glucose (B and D
respectively) as substrates. In order to titrate the intracellular Ca2+
level, increasing concentrations of ionomycin (0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 μM)
were present during the last 30 min of incubation in combination with 10 μM
MK-801 and 30 μM verapamil. The resulting 13C-enrichment in
intracellular alanine was determined by GC-MS. The results are displayed as
the 13C-enrichment of the M+3 isotopomer, i.e. alanine labelled
in all three carbon atoms that originate directly from [U-13C]glucose-
or [U-13C]lactate-derived pyruvate via transamination. The data
were obtained from 3 to 4 individual batches of cerebellar neurons with 5–14
repetitions in total for each condition and the bars represent means±S.E.M.
Significant differences (P<0.05, one-way ANOVA followed
by Bonferroni's post hoc test) from 0 and 0.25 μM
ionomycin are indicated by a and b, respectively. 13C-labelling
from glucose into alanine is enhanced by ionomycin-induced increased intracellular
Ca2+ concentration in the presence but not the absence of lactate
(A and C respectively). Moreover, the 13C-labelling
from glucose is substantially higher in the absence than in the presence of
unlabelled lactate. Since 13C-labelling in alanine reflects that
of pyruvate, these findings indicate not only Ca2+-induced up-regulation
of glycolytic activity but also that lactate is extensively metabolized even
in unstimulated neurons. When lactate is the labelled substrate, ionomycin
brings about a decrease in 13C-labelling in alanine in the presence
of glucose (B). This might be explained by dilution of labelling
due to metabolism of unlabelled glucose, although the corresponding decrease
observed in the absence of glucose (D) argues against this.

Cultures of cerebellar neurons were incubated for 1 h with either 2.5 mM

the data are expressed as percentage of control within each batch of neurons.

ionomycin are indicated by a and b, respectively. 13C-Labelling
from glucose into lactate is enhanced by ionomycin-induced increased intracellular
Ca2+ concentration both in the presence and absence of extracellular
lactate (A and C respectively). This signifies increased
glycolytic activity since labelling in lactate reflects that of pyruvate.
In contrast, ionomycin has no effect on 13C-labelling of intracellular
lactate from the extracellular pool of the same metabolite (B
and D).

Figure 6 Effect of ionomycin on tricarboxylic acid cycle activity
Cultures of cerebellar neurons were incubated for 1 h with either 2.5 mM
[U-13C]glucose in the presence or absence of 1 mM unlabelled lactate
(A and C respectively) or 1 mM [U-13C]lactate
in the presence or absence of 2.5 mM unlabelled glucose (B and D
respectively) as substrates. In order to titrate the intracellular Ca2+
level, increasing concentrations of ionomycin (0, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 μM)
were present during the last 30 min of incubation in combination with 10 μM
MK-801 and 30 μM verapamil. The resulting 13C-enrichment in
intracellular glutamate was determined by GC-MS. Based on the isotopomeric 13C-labelling
of glutamate, the CR, which is a measure of the activity of the tricarboxylic
acid cycle, was calculated as described in the Materials and Methods section.
The data were obtained from 2 to 4 individual batches of cerebellar neurons
with 5–14 repetitions in total for each condition and the bars represent
means±S.E.M. Significant differences (P<0.05, one-way
ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's post hoc test) from 0
to 0.25 μM ionomycin are indicated by a and b, respectively. Irrespective
of the presence of extracellular lactate, the rate of [U-13C]glucose
metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid cycle increases with increasing ionomycin-induced
intracellular Ca2+ levels (A and C).
However, with the exception of 0.25 μM ionomycin in the presence of glucose,
the metabolism of lactate through the tricarboxylic acid cycle is unaffected
by ionomycin (B and D).

In order to obtain information about tricarboxylic acid cycle activity
under the experimental conditions employed, we calculated the CRs for each
experimental condition (see the Materials and methods section and Bak et al. (2006) for details). The CR in the presence of
[U-13C]glucose and unlabelled lactate increased significantly as
a consequence of treatment with ionomycin (Figure
6A), whereas no effect of ionomycin was evident when lactate was the
labelled substrate in the presence of unlabelled glucose (Figure 6B) except for a small but significant increase in
the presence of 0.25 μM ionomycin. When only [U-13C]glucose
or [U-13C]lactate was present, the CRs were higher compared with
when both substrates were present (compare panels C and D to A and B in Figure 6); however, ionomycin-dependent increases
were only evident when [U-13C]glucose but not when [U-13C]lactate
was the sole substrate (Figures 6C and 6D
respectively). Collectively, this indicates metabolic compartmentation and
that the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolizing glucose-derived carbon increases
cycling activity whereas the tricarboxylic acid cycle that metabolizes lactate-derived
carbon operates at a constant level of activity independent of the metabolic
response to the ionomycin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i.

In a separate experiment, CCNs were superfused in the presence of 2.5 mM
glucose (no lactate) and subjected to pulses of NMDA (100 μM; plus 10 μM
glycine) to induce Ca2+-dependent neurotransmission activity as
previously described (see the Materials and methods and Bak et al., 2003; 2009
for further details). The superfusion medium was collected in fractions and
the release of lactate was quantified by measuring the content of lactate
in these fractions. The release (nmol·min−1·mg−1
of protein) was significantly increased when the cultures were subjected to
pulses of NMDA (Figure 7), indicating
increased anaerobic glycolysis.

Figure 7 NMDA-induced release of lactate from CCNs during superfusion in the
presence of 2.5 mM glucose
CCNs were superfused (2 ml/min) in a Hepes-buffered medium containing glucose
(2.5 mM) as substrate and subjected to 30-s pulses consisting of NMDA (100 μM)
and glycine (10 μM). The rate of lactate release was quantified as described
in the Materials and methods section and expressed as nmol of lactate released
per min per mg of protein. a; significantly different from the control (i.e.
no NMDA pulses) as determined employing Student's t
test (P<0.05).

DISCUSSION
We show here that neuronal glucose utilization is increased by an ionomycin-dependent
increase in [Ca2+]i, mimicking neuronal Ca2+
signalling, whereas utilization of extracellular lactate is prominent but
not significantly affected by Ca2+ signalling; these observations
are in line with the CiMASH model (Figure 1)
and furthermore suggestive of compartmentalized glucose and lactate metabolism.
We present a revised CiMASH model in which metabolic compartmentation is taken
into account, dividing the neuron into two metabolic compartments: a presynaptic
compartment metabolizing glucose and a postsynaptic compartment metabolizing
both glucose and lactate.

Ca2+-dependent regulation of glucose and lactate utilization
The observation that glucose utilization increases and lactate utilization
decreases as a consequence of the presence of ionomycin (Figures 3A and 3B) mimics the previous findings that neuronal
glycolysis and subsequent tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism are up-regulated
during NMDA-induced activation (Bak et al.,
2006) and that consumption of glucose but not lactate correlates with
neurotransmission activity (Bak et al., 2009).
Here, we support and extend the earlier findings by demonstrating that the
effects on metabolism previously reported as a consequence of NMDA receptor
stimulation are mirrored by an ionomycin-induced increase in [Ca2+]i.

13C-Labelling in lactate when [U-13C]glucose is the
sole substrate reflects labelling in glycolysis-generated pyruvate that is
transformed into lactate by the reversible LDH-catalysed reaction. Thus, an
increased labelling in lactate per se may not reflect net
lactate production but simply increased glycolytic activity. However, comparing
labelling from [U-13C]glucose into glutamate, lactate and alanine
it is apparent that the relative increase in lactate labelling is greater
for all ionomycin concentrations than the corresponding glutamate and alanine
labelling in the presence of extracellular lactate. This clearly demonstrates
that anaerobic glycolysis is amplified by ionomycin, resulting in net lactate
production. That increased lactate production and release is indeed taking
place in these cultures during neurotransmission activity is evident from
the increase in the rate of lactate release when the cultures were subjected
to pulses of NMDA (Figure 7).

In contrast to the labelling in lactate derived from [U-13C]glucose,
labelling from extracellular [U-13C]lactate into intracellular
lactate was unaffected by ionomycin (Figures
5B and 5D). Since the transfer of lactate between the intra- and extra-cellular
environments is primarily controlled by the concentration gradient across
the plasma membrane one would expect a decrease in uptake of extracellular
lactate when glucose is present due to production of glucose-derived lactate
and, hence, decreased labelling with increasing [Ca2+]i.
However, taken together with the increase in lactate labelled from [U-13C]glucose,
these data indicate a compartmentalization of the lactate produced from glucose
and the extracellular lactate pool where the former is preferentially transported
out of the cell independently of the import and utilization of the latter.
Seemingly opposing this conclusion is a decrease in 13C enrichment
from extracellular [U-13C]-lactate into glutamate and alanine observed
when unlabelled glucose is present (Figures
3B and 4B). However, the decreased
labelling in glutamate (Figure 3B) is
probably due to dilution of labelling in the acetyl-CoA pool as a consequence
of increased glycolytic degradation of glucose, which is also supported by
the unaltered labelling from [U-13C]lactate into glutamate when
glucose is absent (Figure 5D). The reduced
labelling in alanine (Figure 4B) is possibly
due to pyruvate being increasingly transported into the mitochondria to support
augmented tricarboxylic acid cycling; this would likely occur at the expense
of alanine production, as in fact seems to be the case (Figure 4D). Furthermore, a reduced alanine production would
entail an even more pronounced decrease in alanine labelling from extracellular
[U-13C]lactate compared with labelling in glutamate, which is also
apparent from the present experiments (compare Figures
3D and 4D). However, dilution
of labelling due to the presence of glucose cannot explain the decrease in 13C
incorporation into alanine from [U-13C]lactate observed when glucose
is absent (Figure 4D). This decrease
might be due to a reduced production of alanine combined with an increase
in pyruvate recycling activity initiated as a rescue operation to keep tricarboxylic
acid cycling going at the expense of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates
(Olstad et al., 2007); if this is indeed
the case, it clearly signifies that glucose is needed to sustain energy metabolism
during Ca2+-induced activation.

From the above considerations, one might envisage a scenario in which two
pools of mitochondria exist at the postsynaptic region, one primarily but
not exclusively metabolizing extracellular lactate-derived carbon (denoted
type A in Figure 8) and one metabolizing
glucose-derived carbon including glucose-derived lactate (type B); type A
is insensitive whereas type B is sensitive to fluctuations in [Ca2+]i.
This might be caused by the fact that for mitochondria to be sensitive to
Ca2+ signalling, they have to be closely associated with the endoplasmic
reticulum (Franzini-Armstrong, 2007);
thus, a pool of postsynaptic mitochondria may not be closely associated with
the endoplasmic reticulum, likely reflecting a mobile or moving fraction of
mitochondria (MacAskill et al., 2010).
It has been suggested that presynaptic terminals contain no MCTs (monocarboxylate
transporters) necessary for import and export of lactate (Bergersen et al., 2005). Thus, presynaptic terminals may be
fuelled only by oxidative glycolysis (the pyruvate generated is oxidized in
the type C mitochondrial compartment in Figure
8) and glycolytically produced ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation)
may play an important role in providing energy for presynaptic glutamate uptake
and vesicular filling (Ikemoto et al., 2003; Bak et al., 2006; Schousboe
et al., 2011).

Figure 8 A compartmentalized CiMASH model for glutamatergic neurons
In the compartmentalized model, the CiMASH mechanism is working in the
postsynaptic compartment in which NMDA-receptor-mediated Ca2+-induced
Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) directly signals
to a subset of postsynaptic mitochondria (type B) that increase their tricarboxylic
acid cycle activity driven by breakdown of glucose-derived pyruvate (pyr).
Notice that glucose-derived pyruvate is only in partial equilibrium with lactate
(Lac)-generated pyruvate. When the CiMASH mechanism is activated, glucose-derived
lactate is produced and released to the extracellular space for oxidation
at a later time point. Pyruvate derived from extracellular lactate is metabolized
in a mitochondrial compartment that is not affected by postsynaptic Ca2+
signalling (type A). At the presynaptic compartment, the voltage-gated Ca2+
channel (VGCC)-activated ER-to-mitochondria Ca2+-signalling will
affect mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism (type C) of glucose-derived
pyruvate and activate the CiMASH mechanism to some extent; the lactate generated
in this compartment is not able to leave the cell due to lack of transporters.
It should be noted that substrate-level phosphorylation in the glycolytic
pathway probably plays a functionally important role at the presynaptic terminal
(not shown here).

A model of compartmentalized, Ca2+-dependent neuronal bioenergetics
The above considerations may lead to a revised model, in which the CiMASH
mechanism is primarily operating in the postsynaptic compartment (Figure 8). In this model, the following sequence of events
may take place during neurotransmission activity. Upon depolarization, the
presynaptic terminal will consume glycolytic energy producing an intracellular
store of lactate (presuming they have no MCTs) for later oxidation; this is
caused by the idea that the immediate need for ATP for vesicular filling and
in particular presynaptic glutamate uptake is produced by glycolysis, not
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (cf. above). At the postsynaptic end, NMDA-induced
depolarization and the associated spike in [Ca2+]i induce
the CiMASH mechanism, resulting in anaerobic glycolysis and lactate production,
a fraction of which will be released to the extracellular environment and
serve as an extracellular fuel reservoir; the latter may be in accordance
with the ‘reverse’ lactate shuttle suggested by Mangia et al. (2009) as well as the suggestion by Gandhi et al. (2009) of astrocytic uptake of lactate, subsequent
dispersion via the astrocytic syncytium and eventual discharge in a different
location. In the type B mitochondrial compartment, increased cycling activity
results in increased utilization of acetyl-CoA derived from glucose, whereas
in the type A mitochondrial compartment, metabolism of lactate-derived acetyl-CoA
will remain constant. Upon neuronal re-polarization, the neuronal utilization
of the lactate produced during the depolarization event will increase due
to the normalization of the MASH activity. During intense neuronal firing,
the CiMASH mechanism would be even more pronounced, since fluctuations in
the intramitochondrial [Ca2+] may not keep up with the rapid cytosolic
spiking and mitochondria will accumulate Ca2+ and maintain an elevated
intramitochondrial [Ca2+] for a longer period of time (Kaftan et al., 2000). As a final note, it is clear from the
above discussion that the model reflects not only data presented in this manuscript
but includes work from a number of laboratories as well as some aspects that
are somewhat speculative. The task is now to test and if necessary modify
the model based on both in vitro and eventually in
vivo experiments.

Conclusion
The interpretation of the data presented in this paper lends further support
to the CiMASH model and, furthermore leads to a model in which the CiMASH
mechanism is operating at the postsynaptic compartment. Current studies are
directed towards elucidating the second-messenger signalling pathways involved
and establishing the subcellular localization of the CiMASH mechanism including
postsynaptic mitochondrial dynamics.
