Sultana, R., Gandhi, T., Davila, A. M., Lee, C. C., & Ogundele, O. M. (2019). Upregulated SK2 expression and impaired CaMKII phosphorylation are shared synaptic defects between 16p11.2del and 129S:Δdisc1 mutant mice. ASN Neuro, 10, 1–14, DOI:10.1177/1759091418817641

In the above article, the author Tanya Gandhi’s name was incorrectly published as Tanya Ghandi.

On page 4, under the section “Statistical Analysis”, test name was mentioned incorrectly as “Mann–Whitney post hoc test”. It should have been “Tukey post hoc test”. The revised text is given below:

Statistical comparison between WT, 16p11.2del and 129S:Δdisc1 protein expression, fluorescence intensity, time spent in sociability chamber, and neural activity was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc test.

Also, on page 8 (Figure 4a), there was extra β-actin below GluN1. The correct figure is shown below:
