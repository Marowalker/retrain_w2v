intellectual disability. It is a leading known genetic cause of autism. In
addition to cognitive, social, and communication deficits, humans with FXS
demonstrate abnormal sensory processing including sensory hypersensitivity.
Sensory hypersensitivity commonly manifests as auditory, tactile, or visual
defensiveness or avoidance. Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological
studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity, impaired habituation to
repeated sounds, and reduced auditory attention in humans with FXS. Children
with FXS also exhibit significant visuospatial impairments. Studies in infants
and toddlers with FXS have documented impairments in processing texture-defined
motion stimuli, temporal flicker, perceiving ordinal numerical sequence, and the
ability to maintain the identity of dynamic object information during occlusion.
Consistent with the observations in humans with FXS, fragile X mental
retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene
knockout (KO) rodent models of FXS also show seizures, abnormal visual-evoked
responses, auditory hypersensitivity, and abnormal processing at multiple levels
of the auditory system, including altered acoustic startle responses. Among
other sensory symptoms, individuals with FXS exhibit tactile defensiveness.
Fmr1 KO mice also show impaired encoding of tactile
stimulation frequency and larger size of receptive fields in the somatosensory
cortex. Since sensory deficits are relatively more tractable from circuit
mechanisms and developmental perspectives than more complex social behaviors,
the focus of this review is on clinical, functional, and structural studies that
outline the auditory, visual, and somatosensory processing deficits in FXS. The
similarities in sensory phenotypes between humans with FXS and animal models
suggest a likely conservation of basic sensory processing circuits across
species and may provide a translational platform to not just develop biomarkers
but also to understand underlying mechanisms. We argue that preclinical studies
in animal models of FXS can facilitate the ongoing search for new therapeutic
approaches in FXS by understanding mechanisms of basic sensory processing
circuits and behaviors that are conserved across species.

Introduction
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most prevalent cause of inherited intellectual
disability and is a leading genetic cause of autism (Crawford et al., 2001). FXS affects 1 in
4,000 boys and 1 in 8,000 girls and is caused by the silencing, deletion, or
loss-of-function mutation of the fragile X mental retardation 1
(FMR1) gene. As a result, its protein product,
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), is either not expressed or is
nonfunctional (Verkerk et al.,
1991; Sutcliffe
et al., 1992; Okray
et al., 2015). FMRP is a messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein (Ashley et al., 1993b) that
regulates several aspects of mRNA metabolism such as nuclear export, transport to
synaptic terminals, activity-dependent ribosome stalling, and protein translation
(Laggerbauer et al.,
2001; Bagni &
Greenough, 2005; Bassell & Warren, 2008; Darnell et al., 2011; Santoro et al., 2012).

FMRP regulates translation of mRNAs at synapses, some of which encode proteins
involved in synaptic plasticity (Brown et al., 2001; Zalfa et al., 2003). The absence of FMRP leads to the dysregulation of
protein translation and increased protein synthesis (Bear et al., 2004; Darnell & Klann, 2013), which may
contribute to altered metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) signaling resulting
in exaggerated long-term depression (LTD) in the hippocampus (Huber et al., 2002). FMRP also negatively
regulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) translation in neurons (Dziembowska & Wlodarczyk,
2012; Janusz et al.,
2013; Dziembowska
et al., 2013), and MMP-9 levels are elevated in FXS (Bilousova et al., 2009;
Gkogkas et al., 2014;
Sidhu et al., 2014).
mGluR5 and MMP-9 may mediate changes in synaptic functions by signaling through the
phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways to increase
cap-dependent translation (Ferraguti et al., 1999; Gallagher et al., 2004; Hou & Klann, 2004;
Klann & Dever,
2004; Banko et al.,
2006; Hou et al.,
2006; Antion et al.,
2008; Ronesi &
Huber, 2008; Sharma
et al., 2010). Recent data suggest that FMRP may also directly regulate
PI3K and mTORC1 signaling through other signaling proteins, such as
phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase enhancer, phosphatase and tensin homolog,
neurofibromin 1, and tuberous sclerosis 2 (Sharma et al., 2010; Enriquez-Barreto & Morales, 2016; Sato, 2016). In addition,
all three isoforms of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G, eukaryotic
translation elongation factor 1 and 2, argonaute proteins, and Dicer are FMRP
targets, and their dysregulation may also contribute to enhanced neuronal
translation in FXS (Figure
1; Cheever & Ceman,
2009; Darnell et al.,
2011; Muddashetty
et al., 2011).

Figure 1. Mechanisms of sensory phenotypes associated with FXS. Fragile X syndrome is
associated with an expansion of CGG repeats in 5′ untranslated area of the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) gene, which leads to
silencing Fmr1 gene and a partial or full loss of the
fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein
that regulates translation of mRNAs at synapses, some of which encode
proteins involved in protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity. FMRP is
known to regulate protein translation through eukaryotic translation
elongation factor 1/2 (eEF1/2), argonaute proteins (Ago1/2), eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4 E/G (eIF4E/G), and Dicer. FMRP may also
directly regulate phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
signaling. Lack of FMRP also leads to enhanced metabotropic glutamate
receptor 5 (mGluR5)-mediated long-term depression (LTD), reduced voltage and
Ca2+ activated K+ (BK) channel activity, and
increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity, which affect cellular
responses resulting in reduced inhibition, impaired development of
parvalbumin (PV) interneurons and perineuronal nets (PNN), increased UP
states, and abnormal dendritic spine development. These molecular and
cellular alterations can contribute to system-level changes, such as
impaired development of neural circuits, enhanced resting gamma, and altered
excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance, which may underlie sensory
hypersensitivity and altered behaviors observed in FXS.

Dysregulated PI3K/mTOR signaling, enhanced mGluR5-dependent LTD, increased MMP-9
activity, and reduced activity of the voltage and Ca2+ activated
K+ (BKCa or BK) channel may contribute to the immature dendritic
spine morphology in rodent models of FXS (Figure 1; Huber et al., 2000; Nimchinsky et al., 2001; Vanderklish & Edelman,
2002; Hou &
Klann, 2004; Hu
et al., 2008; Sidhu
et al., 2014). In mice, FMRP may also regulate neuronal branching (Galvez et al., 2003) as
well as dendritic spine development (Nimchinsky et al., 2001). Consistent with
animal work, clinical studies revealed alterations in dendritic spine number and
morphology in the cortex of FXS humans, with a prevalence of immature dendritic
spines (Hinton et al.,
1991; Irwin et al.,
2001). In fact, dendritic abnormalities are consistent anatomical
correlates of intellectual disability (Kaufmann & Moser, 2000). Although most
of FMRP activity is considered to be related to the regulation of synaptic functions
(Zhang et al., 2001;
Edbauer et al., 2010;
Darnell et al.,
2011), little is known about how the synaptic alterations in the absence of
FMRP may lead to deficits in neurophysiology and behavior in humans with FXS.
Abnormal dendritic spine development alone cannot explain increased cortical
excitability observed in FXS.

FMRP loss increases network-level hyperexcitability in the rodent cortex through
impaired inhibition and altered neural synchrony (Figure 1; Gonçalves et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). The
Fmr1 KO mouse shows decreased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
receptor levels, decreased GABA synthesis, increased GABA catabolism, and overall
decreased GABAergic input in many regions of the brain (El Idrissi et al., 2005; D'Hulst et al., 2006; Selby et al., 2007; Curia et al., 2009; D'Hulst et al., 2009; Adusei et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2013). FMRP
was also shown to regulate neuronal excitability through the direct interactions
with several ion channels, such as sodium‐activated potassium channel Slack,
presynaptic N‐type voltage‐gated calcium channels, and calcium‐activated potassium
BK channels (Brown et al.,
2010; Zhang et al.,
2012; Deng et al.,
2013; Ferron et al.,
2014; Hébert et al.,
2014; Myrick et al.,
2015). The enhanced excitability is associated with neurological symptoms
observed in FXS, such as hypersensitivity, hyperarousal, hyperactivity, anxiety, and
seizures (Figure 1; Penagarikano et al., 2007;
Braat & Kooy,
2015). However, limited knowledge of the neuronal circuits underlying
complex behaviors, such as anxiety and communication deficits, has hindered the
progress in translating the results of the mouse studies into successful clinical
trials. Potential mechanisms of altered neuronal circuit excitability and how these
changes might impact sensory perception and behavior in FXS are beginning to be
understood. In this review, we bring together clinical, functional, and
neuroanatomical studies that outline auditory, visual, and somatosensory processing
deficits in FXS and how understanding these mechanisms using preclinical studies in
animal models can help our search for new therapeutic applications in FXS.

Animal Models of FXS
To understand the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of FXS, the disease has been
successfully modeled in rodents (Bakker et al., 1994; Eadie et al., 2009; Hamilton et al., 2014), Drosophila (Pan et al., 2008), and
zebrafish (den Broeder et al.,
2009). The mouse Fmr1 gene product shows 97% homology to
human FMRP (Ashley et al.,
1993a). The Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model was generated
with phenotypes similar to those observed in human FXS patients, such as progressive
macroorchidism (Bakker et al.,
1994) and abnormal dendritic spine development (Nimchinsky et al., 2001).
Fmr1 KO mice also demonstrate impaired cognitive functions and
aberrant behaviors (Yan et al.,
2005; Hayashi
et al., 2007). More robust cognitive deficits have been identified in
studies of memory extinction that include inhibitory avoidance paradigm, trace fear
conditioning, and lever-press escape/avoidance tasks (Zhao et al., 2005; Brennan et al., 2006; Dölen et al., 2007; Hayashi et al., 2007; Eadie et al., 2009).
Susceptibility to age-dependent audiogenic seizures is another reproducible
phenotype observed in Fmr1 KO mice (Chen & Toth, 2001; Yan et al., 2005; Dölen et al., 2007). The
mouse FXS model is also tractable for electrophysiology experiments to define the
synaptic alterations associated with FXS. Fmr1 KO hippocampal
neurons show enhanced metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR5)-dependent LTD (Huber et al., 2002). Other
studies have shown deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus,
cortex, and the lateral amygdala (Li et al., 2002; Larson et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2005; Desai et al., 2006; Volk et al., 2007; Wilson & Cox, 2007), suggesting
alterations in synaptic plasticity that may underlie deficits in
experience-dependent brain functions in FXS.

The development of the Fmr1 KO rat model allows for modeling more
complex cognitive and social behaviors associated with FXS (Hamilton et al., 2014). It also provides an
opportunity for comparison of phenotypes across mammalian species that result from
FMRP deletion. Similar to mouse studies, mGluR-LTD was enhanced in
Fmr1 KO rats, whereas mGluR LTP was significantly decreased at
both cortical and thalamic inputs to the lateral amygdala (Jackson, 2017). Adult
Fmr1 KO rats also showed disrupted cortical processing of
auditory stimuli (Engineer
et al., 2014), recapitulated spine density and synaptic plasticity
defects observed in mouse models, and displayed deficits in hippocampal forms of
associative recognition memory (Till et al., 2015) and novel social interaction phenotypes (Hamilton et al., 2014).
Juvenile Fmr1 KO rats exhibit abnormal cortical state regulation
that begins at ages equivalent to human birth (Berzhanskaya et al., 2017). Despite largely
normal patterns of spontaneous activity during the first two postnatal weeks before
eye opening, Fmr1 KO rats exhibit signs of mild hyperexcitability
during the third and fourth postnatal weeks, including an increase in the visually
evoked firing of excitatory neurons and reduced firing of inhibitory neurons (Berzhanskaya et al.,
2017).

Similar to the rodent models of FXS, the fruit fly (Drosophila) is a
powerful genetic model organism for study of FXS. The single FMRP homolog, dFMRP, is
well conserved to human FMRP with respect to its functional amino acid motifs (Wan et al., 2000) and
RNA-binding properties (Darnell
et al., 2005). The fly FXS model system has collectively yielded much
insight into the cognitive, behavioral, and morphological phenotypes associated with
FXS. Morphological analyses of fly neurons have identified defects in axons and
dendrites of specific neuronal subsets, in particular in the neuromuscular junction
and the mushroom body. In the absence of dFmr1 activity, the axons
within the neuromuscular junction display significant increase in synaptic boutons
and branching (Zhang et al.,
2001). Neurons in the mushroom body, a brain area that is required for
short-term and long-term memory, are also affected in dFmr1 mutants
(McBride et al.,
1999; Zars et al.,
2000; Pascual &
Préat, 2001). Moreover, long-term memory defects have been reported in
dFmr1 mutants using olfactory-based assays (Bolduc et al., 2008). dFMRP
has also been shown to be necessary for long-term, but not short-term olfactory
habituation, as indicated by an olfactory avoidance task (Sudhakaran et al., 2014).
Electrophysiology analysis also shows defects in synaptic transmission in the optic
lobe (Zhang et al.,
2001). In addition to axonal, dendritic, and synaptic transmission defects,
male dFmr1-null flies also have enlarged testes, a phenotype that
is observed in both FXS humans and Fmr1 KO mice (Zhang et al., 2004).
Similar to Fmr1 KO mice (Zhang et al., 2008),
dFmr1-null flies lack the ability to maintain a normal
circadian rhythm when placed in total darkness and exhibit erratic patterns of
locomotor activity (Dockendorff
et al., 2002; Inoue
et al., 2002; Morales et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2012). They also lack interest
in courtship (Dockendorff
et al., 2002), a social impairment similar to that found in autism.
Furthermore, FXS flies exhibit impaired olfactory behaviors. The absence of dFMRP
results in reduced olfactory attraction and aversion. Calcium imaging data show that
antennal lobe projection neurons have broader odor tuning in dFmr1
flies, leading to reduced specificity in odor coding and alterations in olfactory
representations. Consistent with these results, lateral inhibition across olfactory
glomeruli, as well as the inhibitory connections between local interneurons and
projection neurons are impaired in dFmr1 flies (Franco et al., 2017). This
suggests that absence of dFMRP leads to abnormal lateral inhibition across olfactory
glomeruli, which, in turn, results in impaired odor coding and olfactory behaviors.
Thus, the fly FXS model displays significant social, cognitive, and sensory deficits
that can be used to examine the underlying mechanisms.

Zebrafish is a more recent animal model that has shown potential as a complementary
vertebrate model in studying the pathophysiology of FXS. The adult zebrafish FMRP
shares 72% amino acid identity with human FMRP and is highly expressed in the brain,
including in the telencephalon, diencephalon, metencephalon, and cerebellum, and
spinal cord (van 't Padje
et al., 2005). In adult zebrafish, Fmr1 KO produces the
anxiolytic-like responses of increased exploratory behavior in light/dark and
open-field tests and avoidance learning impairment, indicating that hyperactivity
and anxiety can be also tested in Fmr1 KO zebrafish. Furthermore,
electrophysiological recordings from telencephalic slice preparations of
Fmr1 KO zebrafish displayed markedly reduced LTP and enhanced
LTD compared to wild-type (WT) counterparts (Ng et al., 2013). Animal models of FXS
have a great potential for elucidating mechanisms underlying cognitive, behavioral,
and morphological phenotypes associated with FXS, as well as preclinical
studies.

Auditory Hypersensitivity and Underlying Mechanisms
Auditory hypersensitivity is common in humans with FXS and mouse models of FXS (Rotschafer & Razak,
2014; Sinclair
et al., 2017b). Notably, studies indicate abnormalities in auditory
processing in people with FXS (St Clair et al., 1987; Rojas et al., 2001; Castrén et al., 2003; Van der Molen et al.,
2012a, 2012b; Schneider et al., 2013). Tone-evoked responses measured using magnetic
fields are higher in the auditory cortex of humans with FXS (Rojas et al., 2001). Increased activation
of left hemispheric circuitry, including superior temporal gyrus, was observed in
FXS subjects during auditory temporal discrimination task (Hall et al., 2009). To assess
sensory-cognitive processing in humans with FXS, various event-related brain
potential (ERP) techniques have been employed. ERPs reflect the activity of neuronal
populations in response to specific sensory-cognitive processes and can be detected
using electroencephalograms (EEG) and magnetoencephalograms (MEG; Luck, 2014). A relatively
simple auditory stimulus can elicit a N1 wave in the auditory cortex. Auditory ERP
studies report abnormally high amplitude of the N1 wave in response to tones and
reduced habituation to repeated sound in FXS (Rojas et al., 2001; Castrén et al., 2003; Van der Molen et al.,
2012a, 2012b; Schneider et al., 2013; Ethridge et al., 2016). FXS patients also
exhibit increased gamma frequency band power during resting state. This increased
gamma activity is believed to be linked to increased neural excitability, and
examining the relationship of alpha and theta band activity with gamma band activity
might provide system-level understanding about the altered balance between
excitatory and inhibitory activity (Wang et al., 2017). Furthermore, a recent
study shows that humans with FXS demonstrate a marked reduction in the ability to
synchronize evoked high-frequency neural activity to time-varying signals,
suggesting impairments in underlying neural generators involved in sensory
processing (Ethridge et al.,
2017). These data indicate a noisy resting state of
sensory cortex in people with FXS that may lead to abnormal synchronization of
evoked responses. Auditory cortex processing abnormalities that arise early in
development may contribute to higher order auditory functional deficits such as
language deficits seen in FXS and autism (Roberts et al., 2001; Nieto Del Rincón, 2008;
Barnes et al., 2009;
Finestack et al.,
2009; Roberts
et al., 2011). However, very little is known about development of EEG/MEG
abnormalities and correlations with language development in humans.

Fmr1 KO mice also exhibit abnormal prepulse inhibition and auditory
startle responses, with greater startle responses than WT mice to low-intensity (80
dB) white noise bursts and decreased responses to high-intensity (120 dB) white
noise bursts (Nielsen et al.,
2002). Fmr1 KO mice are also acoustically hypersensitive
and are prone to audiogenic seizures (Miller et al., 1999; Chen & Toth, 2001; Nielsen et al., 2002;
Frankland et al.,
2004), suggesting enhanced excitability in the auditory system. Intense
auditory stimuli (>100 dB SPL) induces a period of wild running, clonic–tonic
seizing, and can result in the death of the animal (Musumeci et al., 2000; Chen & Toth, 2001;
Musumeci et al.,
2007; Dansie et al.,
2013). Reintroduction of FMRP to Fmr1 KO mice
significantly reduces audiogenic seizure susceptibility (Musumeci et al., 2007). In addition, the
audiogenic seizure phenotype of Fmr1 KO mice is prevented by the
systemic administration of the mGluR5 receptor antagonist, MPEP (Yan et al., 2005).
Enhanced susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is a robust phenomenon in
Fmr1 KO mice and is one of the most widely used outcome
measures in preclinical drug discovery studies. The auditory brainstem expresses
high FMRP levels (Wang et al.,
2014), and abnormal sensory processing at the level of the auditory
brainstem may underlie the enhanced susceptibility to audiogenic seizures. FMRP
interactions with sodium‐activated potassium channel Slack in the auditory brainstem
and its ability to regulate Slack activity may also explain increased excitability
in the auditory brainstem of Fmr1 KO mice (Brown et al., 2010). In addition,
Fmr1 KO mice show enhanced acoustic startle responses (Chen & Toth, 2001;
Nielsen et al.,
2002; Frankland et al.,
2004; Yun et al.,
2006). Abnormal habituation of acoustic startle responses, which is
accompanied with hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli, was also
shown to be dependent on BK channel functions (Zaman et al., 2017). BK channels can
directly interact with FMRP, and their functions are affected by the loss of FMRP
(Deng et al., 2013),
whereas the upregulation of BK channel activity in a mouse model of FXS was shown to
normalize the enhanced glutamate release and excessive epileptiform activity (Deng & Klyachko, 2016).
However, the mechanisms by which the absence of FMRP in the specific brain areas,
such as brainstem or cortex, leads to the enhanced excitability need to be further
studied to better understand the epileptic phenotype of FXS.

In vivo recordings from the auditory cortex show that the abnormal
cortical processing may underlie auditory hypersensitivity in Fmr1
KO mouse (Rotschafer &
Razak, 2013). First, single-unit recordings show that cortical neurons
respond to tones with more action potentials in Fmr1 KO mice than
WT neurons in both adults (Rotschafer & Razak, 2013) and P21 mice (Wen et al., 2017). The increased responses
are due to prolonged firing of action potentials well after stimulus offset. Second,
there is also increased variability of spike timing, broader frequency receptive
fields, and reduced spectrotemporal selectivity in the Fmr1 KO
cortex. The broader receptive fields mean that more neurons will be activated
synchronously for any given sound in the KO cortex. Third, recordings from KO mice
cortex to repeated sound presentation shows reduced habituation of response
amplitudes. Together these findings suggest that hypersensitivity arises due to a
triple hit—increased response per neuron, more number of
responsive neurons, and reduced habituation of responses.

Remarkably similar EEG phenotypes are also present in Fmr1 KO mice
and humans with FXS (Sinclair et al., 2017a,
2017b; Lovelace
et al., 2018). Lovelace et al. recorded EEG signals from both auditory
and frontal cortex of awake, freely moving mice and compared the WT and
Fmr1 KO genotypes. They identified increased gamma power in
baseline EEG, reduced evoked phase synchronization to auditory stimuli in the gamma
band, and larger ERP N1 component amplitudes in the KO mice (Lovelace et al., 2018). These data are
essentially identical to findings in humans with FXS (Ethridge et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017).
Together these data support the notion that there is a milieu of noisy resting state
in the auditory cortex in FXS in addition to the triple hit mentioned earlier giving
rise to auditory hypersensitivity.

Most studies on humans with FXS have focused on older children or adolescents.
However, abnormalities in auditory processing may arise from altered critical period
plasticity during development. In the auditory cortex, Fmr1 KO mice
show abnormal critical period plasticity in response to developmental tone exposure
(Kim et al., 2013),
which effectively reduces activity- or experience-evoked responses of neuronal
networks. The impaired sound exposure-induced cortical map plasticity in the
Fmr1 KO mice may extend into adulthood affecting stability of
auditory circuits and may underlie the abnormalities found in the adult auditory
cortical responses (Rotschafer
& Razak, 2013). We have proposed a specific mechanism for development
of auditory hypersensitivity in the Fmr1 KO mice (Wen et al., 2017).
Impaired development of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing inhibitory interneurons may
underlie abnormal auditory processing in Fmr1 KO mice via
MMP-9-dependent regulation of perineuronal nets (Wen et al., 2017). In normal brain, the
development of PV interneurons is implicated in shaping critical period plasticity,
stabilization of synaptic networks, and network synchronization (Hensch, 2005; Jeevakumar & Kroener,
2016), whereas perineuronal net loss around PV cells is associated with
abnormal critical period plasticity and reduced excitability of PV cells (Pizzorusso et al., 2002;
Balmer, 2016; Lensjø et al., 2017). The
formation of perineuronal nets, which consists of extracellular matrix proteins,
coincides with the closure of critical period plasticity window creating a
nonpermissive environment for new synapse growth and structural plasticity. A
disruption of extracellular matrix affects the stability of existing circuits and
opens critical period plasticity window, which may underlie auditory
hyperexcitability in FXS (Happel
& Frischknecht, 2016). Studies have reported higher MMP-9 activity in
Fmr1 KO mouse brains and humans with FXS, suggesting that MMP-9
dysregulation may contribute to FXS-associated deficits (Bilousova et al., 2009; Gkogkas et al., 2014; Sidhu et al., 2014). The
increased MMP-9 activity may delay the maturation of cortical circuits and extend
critical period plasticity past the normal developmental window affecting the
maturation of functional circuits.

The role of MMP-9 upregulation in FXS symptoms is supported by the fact that the
genetic reduction of MMP-9 activity in the brain of Fmr1 KO mice
restored auditory responses and the formation of perineuronal nets around PV cells
in the Fmr1 KO mice to WT levels (Wen et al., 2017). MMP-9 deletion in the
Fmr1 KO mice also reversed ERP N1 amplitude habituation
deficits (Lovelace et al.,
2016). As genetic deletion of MMP-9 can also reverse FXS-associated
behaviors in Fmr1 KO mice (Bilousova et al., 2009; Sidhu et al., 2014), MMP-9
is an attractive therapeutic target to reduce sensory deficits in FXS and
potentially other FXS-associated behaviors. Indeed, minocycline, which beside its
antibiotic effects inhibits MMP-9, has emerged as a potential treatment for FXS
(Bilousova et al.,
2009; Paribello
et al., 2010; Dansie
et al., 2013; Dziembowska et al., 2013; Leigh et al., 2013; Schneider et al., 2013; Rotschafer & Razak,
2014; Yau et al.,
2018). In humans with FXS, minocycline can reduce MMP-9 levels, reverse
auditory ERP deficits, and improve FXS-associated behaviors (Paribello et al., 2010; Dziembowska et al., 2013;
Leigh et al., 2013;
Schneider et al.,
2013). However, several adverse effects of minocycline, such as stained
teeth, skin pigmentation, gastrointestinal disturbance, drug-induced lupus, and

there is an unmet need in developing novel, potent, and selective MMP-9 inhibitors
to treat auditory hypersensitivity associated with FXS and potentially other
neurodevelopmental disorders associated with sensory hypersensitivity, such as
autism.

Taken together, studies of auditory processing and sensitivity in humans with FXS and
Fmr1 KO mice show remarkable overlap in phenotypes, providing a
translation relevant framework for both mechanism and drug discovery. It must be
noted that FMRP is expressed in multiple nuclei of the auditory system (Zorio et al., 2017), and
cortical processing deficits may be intrinsic to cortical changes or inherited from
subcortical sites (Strumbos
et al., 2010; Rotschafer et al., 2015; Garcia-Pino et al., 2017; Rotschafer & Cramer,
2017). How multiple regions of the auditory system contribute to symptoms
that range from hypersensitivity to language and communication deficits is not
understood and is an important direction for future studies. The availability of
mouse models in which the protein can be removed from specific neuron types,
regions, and time points will aid such future studies.

Visual-Motor Deficits
A prominent feature of the FXS neurobehavioral phenotype is diminished performance on
neuropsychological tasks that assess visual‐motor function. Visuomotor dysfunction
have been described for tasks that require drawing skills (Crowe & Hay, 1990; Freund & Reiss, 1991),
tasks that involve manipulation of blocks to construct abstract designs (Crowe & Hay, 1990;
Cornish et al.,
1999), and tasks requiring psychomotor coordination (Cornish et al., 1999). Although these tasks
are multifactorial in nature and the performance affected by many causes,
visual‐motor ability is a common feature. This led to the hypothesis that the
visual‐motor deficiencies observed in FXS may reflect underlying neuroanatomical and
functional abnormalities specific to the thalamic component of one of the two main
parallel visual pathways called the magnocellular pathway (Kogan et al., 2004b). Dysfunctions of the
pathway may lead to impaired visually guided actions requiring the manipulation of
objects, further explaining why individuals with FXS perform poorly on a variety of
neuropsychological tasks that have a visual‐motor component.

Additional behavioral studies in infants and toddlers with FXS have documented
impairments in processing texture-defined motion stimuli (Farzin et al., 2008), temporal flicker
(Farzin et al.,
2011), perceiving the ordinality of sequences of numerical displays (Owen et al., 2013), and
the ability to maintain the identity of dynamic object information during occlusion
(Farzin & Rivera,
2010). Impaired performance has also been demonstrated on tasks requiring
inhibitory control (Scerif
et al., 2007) as well as numerical reasoning (Rivera et al., 2002; Murphy et al., 2006). One possible reason
behind the visual-spatial and numerical deficits seen in FXS is disruption of the
so-called dorsal stream (occipitoparietal visual pathway, projecting to the
posterior-lateral parietal cortex, which processes information involved in guiding
actions, including spatial location and motion) with relative sparing of the ventral
stream (occipitotemporal visual pathway, projecting to the inferior temporal cortex,
which processes object features such as form and color; Ungerleider, 1982; Milner & Goodale, 2006). Because of
its relatively prolonged time course of development (Atkinson, 2002), the dorsal stream is
thought to be particularly vulnerable to atypical development in a number of
disorders, including FXS (Kogan
et al., 2004a; Farzin
& Rivera, 2010).

Vision integration is affected in humans with FXS with alteration of spatiotemporal
visual processing, reduction of contrast sensitivity for visual stimuli presented at
high temporal frequencies, and visual sensitivity for both static and moving images
(Kogan et al.,
2004b; Farzin et al.,
2011). These deficits may be associated with a delayed development in the
primary visual cortex as seen in the model of FXS premutation (Berman et al., 2012). However, before being
integrated at the cortex level, the visual signals are detected, processed, and
transmitted by the retina. Fmr1 deficiency has been shown to affect
retinal function, with abnormal wiring of neuronal connections and synaptic
destabilization in the retina leading to similar cellular and functional phenotypes
as seen in the brain (Rossignol
et al., 2014). Since animal behaviors rely on sensory processing (which
allows mice to integrate environmental stimuli and to adapt their action); this
makes one wonder how far retinal defects, as opposed to cortical processing defects,
are involved in the recorded behavioral impairments seen in Fmr1 KO
mice, such as visuospatial deficits, diminished performance on neuropsychological
tasks that assess visuomotor function, and impairments in processing texture-defined
motion stimuli.

Enhanced mGluR5 signaling may contribute to sensory impairments seen in
Fmr1 KO mice as mGluR5 signaling is downregulated during normal
maturation and synaptic stabilization in the postnatal brain (Dudek & Bear, 1989). Indeed, using
genetic approach, Dölen et al.
(2007) have shown the importance of mGluR5, as well as FMRP, in the
regulation of ocular dominance plasticity during the development of visual cortex. A
50% reduction in mGluR5 expression prevents ocular dominance plasticity induced by a
3-day monocular deprivation, suggesting that this receptor normally serves to enable
plasticity in the visual cortex. In contrast, in the absence of FMRP,
Fmr1 KO mice show altered ocular dominance plasticity (Dölen et al., 2007). The
response to monocular deprivation is characterized by both deprived-eye response
depression and open-eye response potentiation, suggesting that FMRP normally serves
to restrict plasticity in the visual cortex (Dölen & Bear, 2008). Interestingly,
since ocular dominance plasticity is protein synthesis dependent (Taha & Stryker, 2002),
it is a possibility that excessive protein synthesis is responsible for altered
plasticity in the visual cortex of Fmr1 KO mice.

Last, by examining the visual cortices in Fmr1 KO mice as well as
those in the individuals with FXS, multiple studies have shown that FMRP is critical
to the pruning and maturation of dendritic spines (Greenough et al., 2001; Irwin et al., 2001; Churchill et al., 2002).
Neurons lacking FMRP retain characteristically immature dendritic spines within the
visual cortex (Kogan et al.,
2004b). Furthermore, the density of immature spines is elevated in FXS
humans compared with normal control brains. Interestingly, this immature spine
phenotype is also induced by the activation of Gp1 mGluRs in the visual cortical
pyramidal neurons (Vanderklish
& Edelman, 2002). Spine density is significantly increased in
Fmr1 KO mice, and the phenotype can be rescued by 50% reduction
in mGluR5 expression (Dölen
et al., 2007). This indicates that the absence of FMRP and the
upregulation of mGluR5 may therefore lead to abnormal development of visual circuits
and potentially impaired processing of visual stimuli.

Somatosensory Processing Deficits and Tactile Defensiveness
Impaired processing of tactile information is seen in individuals with FXS, with
hypersensitivity to touch being common (Cascio, 2010). The Fmr1 KO
mouse model has phenotypes similar to those observed in humans with FXS (van den Ouweland et al.,
1994). In mice, tactile information received through deflections of
whiskers is processed in the somatosensory barrel cortex (Diamond et al., 2008; Diamond & Arabzadeh, 2013; Feldmeyer et al., 2013).
Correct processing of whisker-mediated touch information requires the formation of
receptive fields in the somatosensory cortex (Simons, 1978; Simons & Carvell, 1989). Development
of intracortical connections plays a key role in the formation of the receptive
fields and depends on sensory experience (Allen et al., 2003; Bender et al., 2006). Exposure of juvenile
animals to patterned sensory input refined the balance of excitation and inhibition
(Dorrn et al., 2010;
Sun et al., 2010),
resulting in receptive field and sensory map reorganization and a long-lasting
impact on sound perception (Han
et al., 2007). Therefore, the enlarged receptive fields in
Fmr1 KO mice may be a consequence of altered sensory
integration during the early postnatal development.

In vivo recordings from barrel cortex revealed that
Fmr1 KO mice show an enlargement in the cortical area activated
by whisker deflections, that is, an expansion of the somatosensory maps in L2/3.
Furthermore, the encoding of tactile stimuli at different frequencies was severely
impaired in Layer 2/3 as well (Juczewski et al., 2016). These findings highlight neuronal mechanisms
that could contribute to the different exploratory behavior such as tactile
defensiveness or tactile sensitivity (Reiss & Freund, 1990;
Baranek et al., 1997;
Miller et al., 1999;
Baranek et al.,
2008), which is observed in Fmr1 KO mice (Arnett et al., 2014; Santos et al., 2014).
Furthermore, a decrease in the whisker selectivity index is evident in
Fmr1 KO mice over a range of stimulation parameters, indicating
that the specificity with which deflection of a given whisker activates cortex has
decreased (Juczewski et al.,
2016).

Moreover, there are profound alterations in the neuronal excitability in Layer 4 of
somatosensory barrel cortex in the Fmr1 KO mouse at the synaptic,
cellular, and network levels. Gibson et al.’s work on Fmr1 KO mice
somatosensory cortex has shown that there is a decrease in connectivity frequency
and strength resulting in an approximate 50% reduction in excitatory drive onto
fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons. In addition, excitatory neurons become
intrinsically more excitable in the KO mice. These changes can lead to
hyperexcitable circuits, a hypothesis that was supported by observed increase in UP
state duration in somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice (Gibson et al., 2008).
Consistent with impaired FS inhibitory circuitry, network synchrony within a single
cortical column during the UP state is decreased as well (Gibson et al., 2008). Similar to our
findings in the auditory cortex (Wen et al., 2017), there is a significant
reduction in PV immunoreactivity in the somatosensory cortex of adult
Fmr1 KO mice (Selby et al., 2007). PV interneurons
receive both intracortical and thalamic excitatory inputs, which develop during the
cortical critical period (Daw
et al., 2007a; Chittajallu & Isaac, 2010). A recent study has shown that there is a
significant delay in the formation of excitatory contacts onto FS interneurons,
which likely has a large impact on the integration of feedforward inhibitory
circuits in the developing somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice
(Nomura et al.,
2017).

Gonçalves et al. showed that Fmr1 KO mice exhibit abnormally high
synchrony of neocortical network activity in mouse somatosensory cortex, especially
during development. Neuronal firing rates are significantly higher in
Fmr1 KO mice compared with WT mice during whole-cell recordings
manifesting UP/Down states (slow-wave sleep, quiet wakefulness), probably due to the
higher firing probability during UP states. Combined electroencephalography and
calcium imaging experiments confirmed that neurons in KO mice have abnormally high
firing and synchrony during sleep, leading to the conclusion that cortical networks
in FXS are hyperexcitable in a brain state-dependent manner during a critical period
for experience-dependent plasticity (Gonçalves et al., 2013). Several studies
have also shown both molecular and functional disruption in GABA signaling in FXS
(El Idrissi et al.,
2005; D'Hulst et al.,
2006; Gantois et al.,
2006; Paluszkiewicz
et al., 2011). The timing of the switch from depolarizing to
hyperpolarizing GABA is delayed in the somatosensory cortex of Fmr1
KO mice, and there is a concurrent alteration in the expression of the neuronal
chloride cotransporter NKCC1 that promotes the accumulation of intracellular
chloride (He et al.,
2014). While the actual mechanisms that control the developmental
expression of the NKCC1 are not known, it is significant that NKCC1 is predominantly
found in astrocytes. With the discovery of FMRP in astrocytes (Pacey & Doering, 2007), coupled with a
role of astrocytes in synaptic function and glutamate metabolism (Ullian et al., 2004; Ethell & Pasquale,
2005; Paixão &
Klein, 2010), it is possible that astrocytes contribute, in some
capacity, to the abnormal dendritic spine and synapse development, as well as
circuit hyperexcitability seen in FXS (Jacobs & Doering, 2010; Jacobs et al., 2010; Higashimori et al., 2013;
Higashimori et al.,
2016). Abnormal trophic effects of GABA during cortical development may
also disrupt the normal trophic function of GABA and contribute to the delayed
maturation of glutamatergic synapses in FXS.

Cellular deficits have also been observed in the somatosensory cortex of
Fmr1 KO mice. As in the auditory and visual cortices, an
abundance of abnormally long, thin dendritic spines have been reported in pyramidal
neurons during early development in the somatosensory cortex (Nimchinsky et al., 2001; Galvez & Greenough,
2005), and abnormal developmental pruning of the Layer 4 spiny stellate
cell dendrites has been described in Fmr1 KO mice (Galvez et al., 2003).
Despite the clear alterations in cellular morphology in Fmr1 KO
mice, it is not known whether the anatomical deficits have an impact on the
functional development of excitatory glutamatergic synapses in somatosensory cortex.
During perinatal development in rodents, activity-dependent refinement of excitatory
thalamocortical synapses in the somatosensory cortex leads to a stereotypical
maturation of glutamatergic signaling (Crair & Malenka, 1995; Barth & Malenka, 2001).
Thalamocortical synapses exhibit LTP and LTD throughout the critical plasticity
period in Layer 4 (Crair &
Malenka, 1995; Feldman et al., 1998). Activity-dependent maturation of excitatory
thalamocortical synapses during the critical period results in rapid changes in the
synaptic composition of glutamate receptors (Crair & Malenka, 1995; Kidd & Isaac, 1999;
Daw et al., 2007b).
The α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor
contribution increases relative to the
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Crair & Malenka, 1995),
and the proportion of NMDA-only silent synapses is reduced (Isaac et al., 1997).

Cortical glutamate receptors have been implicated in the development of the barrel
cortex maps and the refinement of cortical sensory circuits that underlie sensory
processing (Schlaggar et al.,
1993). Harlow et al.
(2010) showed that early postnatal development of excitatory connections
from the thalamus to Layer 4 spiny stellate neurons is critically disrupted during a
critical plasticity period in Fmr1 KO mice. Moreover, the
progressive development of excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptor signaling, which
normally occurs over the first postnatal week, is delayed as well (Harlow et al., 2010; Till et al., 2012). There
is also an altered NMDAR-to-AMPAR ratio observed in the somatosensory cortex of
Fmr1 KO mice manifesting as an increase in the fraction of
silent synapses (NMDA-only thalamocortical synapses) at the closure of the critical
plasticity period (Harlow
et al., 2010). Synaptic plasticity and experience-dependent refinement of
sensory circuits are inextricably linked, and NMDA receptors play a central role in
both processes. Therefore, alteration in NMDA receptor signaling and the
developmental maturation of silent synapses during the critical plasticity period
will most likely affect the development of cortical circuits.

Just like in the auditory and visual cortices, FMRP is required for the normal
developmental progression of synaptic maturation in the somatosensory cortex. Loss
of FMRP impacts the development of cortical synapses and results in dysregulation of
glutamatergic maturation in the somatosensory cortex during the early postnatal
critical plasticity period. Moreover, increased proportion of silent synapses
persists into late postnatal development, which coincides with a temporal delay in
the window for synaptic plasticity (Harlow et al., 2010; Till et al., 2012).

Conclusions and Future Studies
Hyperarousal and anxiety in humans with FXS may be linked to strong reactions to
sensory stimuli. There is an abundance of evidence describing sensory cortical
dysfunctions in the Fmr1 KO mice and in humans with FXS (Table 1). The common
underlying phenotype is sensory hypersensitivity, including
hypersensitivity to visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli that may lead to behavioral
alterations such as poor eye contact, avoidance of noisy places, anxiety, and
impaired social reciprocity. These alterations in sensory processing appear to be a
universal problem in individuals with FXS, as they cause impairment in processing
and encoding of many types of sensory information, which may affect more complex
social behaviors. Moreover, sensory processing disorders could occur because of
dysfunction at multiple levels of each sensory system. The Fmr1 KO
mice also display deficiencies in sensory processing that may help to understand the
mechanism of sensory hypersensitivity in FXS (Figure 2). Mechanisms underlying the sensory
hypersensitivity may be relatively more tractable compared with more complex social
behaviors typically studied in FXS. Therefore, it is of critical importance to use
sensory hypersensitivity as a robust, reliable, and translatable phenotype to
integrate preclinical and clinical investigations at multiple levels of analysis to
facilitate drug discovery in FXS.

Indeed, studies of mouse sensory hypersensitivity neurobehavioral phenotypes have led
to a better understanding of circuit-level pathophysiology in FXS. The heightened
sensory activity seen in humans with FXS may stem from a concurrence of
dysfunctional intrinsic excitability or impaired inhibition due to a loss or
abnormal development of inhibitory neurons, abnormal dendrite morphology, or reduced
GABAergic activity. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of circuit
hyperexcitability are beginning to be understood. Fmr1 KO mouse
somatosensory and auditory cortex show weakened inhibitory interneuron activity and
more excitable pyramidal neurons that may underlie changes in sensory and high-order
cognitive behaviors seen in Fmr1 KO mice (Figure 2). Disrupted cytoarchitecture of
sensory circuits in Fmr1 KO mice during early development may
impair the ability of mice to integrate sensory experiences leading to abnormal
sensory circuit development, learning, and high-order cognitive skills that persist
into adulthood.

FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, but the mechanisms of impaired development of
functional neural response selectivity to sensory stimuli are still unclear. The
predominant focus of published work in the FXS field has been on characterizing the
changes in dendritic spine properties and synaptic or intrinsic properties of
neurons. However, the consequences of these synaptic changes to development of
behaviorally relevant neural response properties in FXS are not known. Therefore, it
is not clear if the observed sensory hypersensitivity in humans with FXS is due to
an altered regulation of developmental processes during critical plasticity period
that persists into adulthood. The majority of studies using Fmr1 KO
mice focus on the neuronal responses and behaviors during a specific developmental
window or in adult mice while neglecting to look at any long-term changes in
Fmr1 KO mice from early development into adulthood and the
long-term impact of early treatment to reverse FXS-associated behavioral deficits.
Is the loss of FMRP only detrimental during a critical plasticity period or are the
changes attributed to the ongoing absence of FMRP? A recent finding that eliminating
FMRP in only the prefrontal cortex of adult mice can lead to abnormal learning
suggests FMRP continues to plays a role in neural function even after critical
plasticity period ends (Siegel
et al., 2017). In addition, some phenotypes are reversed in the adult
animal models by acute pharmacological treatments. However, it is not clear whether
the acute effects are long-lasting. Moreover, chronic treatments may result in drug
tolerance. Further studies are needed to determine developmental versus adult
effects of FMRP loss on cortical responses to identify specific time windows, which
can be targeted therapeutically.

Questions on whether the animal models are appropriate to study human neurological
disorders have arisen due to the inability to translate preclinical therapeutic
success to the clinic (Dahlhaus,
2018). Indeed it is important to compare multiple model systems for any
neurological disorder. Regardless of the animal model studied (even in nonhuman
primates), the manifestation of cognitive and social symptoms will depend on
underlying circuits that are quite different across species. The development of
these circuits is also difficult to probe. Sensory processing circuits and
mechanisms are more likely to show relatively more similarities. This is seen in FXS
studies that show very similar baseline and sound-evoked EEG phenotypes in mice and
humans (Schneider et al.,
2013; Lovelace
et al., 2016; Ethridge et al., 2017; Sinclair et al., 2017b; Wang et al., 2017). In
addition, few studies of FXS (in humans and mice) have quantified developmental
trajectories and roles of FMRP (Table 1). Again, when additional model systems are studied, it is
imperative to analyze changes in circuit function over development. Therefore, we
argue that development of sensory hypersensitivity may be used as a neurobehavioral
probe to more successfully evaluate and translate drug treatments from preclinical
models to humans, as well as underlying mechanisms of FXS-associated deficits.
