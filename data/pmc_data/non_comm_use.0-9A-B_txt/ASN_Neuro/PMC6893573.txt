pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).We previously showed that treatment with lanthionine ketimine ethyl ester
(LKE) reduced disease severity and axonal damage in an experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis
and increased neuronal maturation and survival in
vitro. A major target of LKE is collapsin response
mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), suggesting this protein may mediate LKE
actions. We now show that conditional knockout of CRMP2 from neurons
using a CamK2a promoter to drive Cre recombinase expression reduces
disease severity in the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein
(MOG)35–55 EAE model, associated with decreased
spinal cord axonal damage, and less glial activation in the
cerebellum, but not the spinal cord. Immunohistochemical staining and
quantitative polymerase chain reaction show CRMP2 depletion from
descending motor neurons in the motor cortex, but not from spinal cord
neurons, suggesting that the benefits of CRMP2 depletion on EAE may
stem from effects on upper motor neurons. In addition, mice in which
CRMP2 S522 phosphorylation was prevented by substitution for an
alanine residue also showed reduced EAE severity. These results show
that modification of CRMP2 expression and phosphorylation can
influence the course of EAE and suggests that treatment with CRMP2
modulators such as LKE act in part by reducing CRMP2 S522
phosphorylation.

Introduction
We previously showed that clinical scores in the myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG)35–55 peptide-induced experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis (MS) were significantly
reduced by administration of lanthionine ketimine ethyl ester (LKE),
accompanied by reductions in axonal damage in spinal cord and optic nerve
(Dupree et al.,
2015). LKE is a derivatized form of the amino acid lanthionine,
a nonproteogenic amino acid synthesized via transulfuration of cysteine with
serine by cystathionine-β-synthase (Hensley et al., 2010b). Previous
studies showed that LKE promotes growth factor-dependent elongation and
thickening of neurites, suppresses TNFα-induced nitric oxide production from
microglia, and reduces neurotoxicity due to microglial-conditioned medium
(Nada et al.,
2012; Hensley et al., 2013). LKE is neuroprotective in mouse models
of ischemia (Nada
et al., 2012), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Hensley et al., 2013; Koehler et al.,
2018), fluid percussion injury (Hensley et al., 2016), and spinal
cord injury (Kotaka
et al., 2017). We reported that LKE has direct neuroprotective
and neurotrophic effects on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and on primary
mouse cerebellar granule cells (Marangoni et al., 2018); and that
in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) LKE induced branch
elongation and increased messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of markers of OPC
maturation (Savchenko
et al., 2019). However, whether the beneficial actions of LKE
in EAE are mediated via effects on neurons or other cell types is not yet
known.

Despite showing numerous beneficial actions, the mechanisms of action mediating
LKE effects remain to be determined. Proteomic studies showed that LKE binds
to several proteins present in synaptic complexes, the primary target being
collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) (Hensley et al., 2010a). CRMP2 is
a member of a family of five proteins that act as adaptor proteins and
interact with binding partners affecting various cellular functions
including division, migration, polarity, synaptic connections, and
cytoskeletal architecture (Khanna et al., 2012; Moutal et al.,
2019b). In the CNS, CRMP2 has been well characterized with
respect to neurite growth and retraction, neural differentiation, axonal
transport, and neurotransmitter release (Quach et al., 2004; Chae et al.,
2009; Hensley
et al., 2011; Quach et al., 2015). CRMP2 and
other members of this family are highly expressed in the nervous system
during early development, and downregulated in the adult (Quach et al.,
2000; Rogemond et al., 2008) where it remains expressed in neurons
as well as in glial cells.

CRMP2 effects on axon elongation and neurite extension involve binding to
tubulin dimers which are then transferred to the growing plus end of
microtubules (Fukata
et al., 2002). CRMP2 binding to tubulin is regulated by its
phosphorylation status, in particular phosphorylation of serine 522 (S522)
by cyclin dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) (Uchida et al., 2005), which in
turn is permissive for phosphorylation at Thr509, 514, and 518 by glycogen
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (Uchida et al., 2005).
Phosphorylation at these sites reduces CRMP2’s affinity for tubulin
heterodimers, thus reducing microtubule growth and causing axon retraction
(Uchida et al.,
2005). Blocking S522A phosphorylation is protective as
indicated by findings that the inhibition of Cdk5, or the use of a
non-phosphorylatable S522A CRMP2 vector, reduced neurite growth defects in
hippocampal cells (Crews
et al., 2011); and that knockin (KI) mice with CRMP2 S522A have
reduced impairment of synaptic plasticity due to amyloid peptide Aβ (Isono et al.,
2013). More recently, interfering with CRMP2 phosphorylation at
S522 was shown to reduce pathology in models of Parkinson’s disease (PD)
(Togashi et al.,
2019), chronic pain (Moutal et al., 2016a; Yu et al., 2018;
Moutal et al.,
2019a), migraine (Moutal et al., 2016b),
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) (Moutal et al., 2017b), bipolar
disorder (Tobe et al.,
2017), glioblastoma (Moutal et al., 2018c), and
SOD1G93A amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Numata-Uematsu et al., 2019). It
was also reported that CRMP2 phosphorylation plays a critical role in
Nogo-receptor signaling (Petratos et al., 2012), and that overexpression of a
nonphoshorylatable CRMP2 (at threonine 555) attenuates axonal damage in the
optic nerve of EAE mice (Lee et al., 2019). Together these studies point to a role for
CRMP2 in modulating disease progression in mouse models of neurodegenerative
diseases.

Several studies suggest that LKE works, at least in part, by inhibiting the
activity of Cdk5, thus reducing CRMP2 S522A phosphorylation (Hensley et al.,
2011; Nada
et al., 2012; Hubbard et al., 2013). It is
therefore possible that the effects of LKE in MOG35–55 peptide
induced EAE are mediated by modulation of CRMP2 activity. To begin to
address this, we generated CRMP2 conditional knockout (cKO) from neurons and
examined the consequences on the development of EAE. We found that the
neuronal CRMP2 cKO mice showed reduced clinical signs and less
neuropathology as compared to controls. Since CRMP2 phosphorylation
regulates its activity, we used the CRMP2-S522A KI mice and found that these
mice also show reduced disease severity as compared to wild-type (WT)
control mice.

Methods
Mice
All animal studies were approved by both the University of Illinois
Chicago and the Jesse Brown VA Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees. Mouse ESCs (Dpysl2tm1a(KOMP)Wtsi, RRID:IMSR_KOMP:CSD38021-1a-Wtsi), harboring a
Knockout First, promoter driven CRMP2 allele were obtained from
Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository, rederived, then crossed to
Rosa26-FLPe mice (RRID:IMSR_JAX:003946) to delete the neomycin
cassette (see Supplemental figure 1) yielding CRMP2f/f
mice. CRMP2f/f mice were crossed to CamK2a-CreER(T2)
(“Cre,” B6;129S6-Tg(Camk2a-cre/ERT2)1Aibs/J, RRID:IMSR_JAX:012362) mice and backcrossed to
generate CRMP2f/f:Cre+/− and
CRMP2f/f:Cre−/− mice. Frozen embryos from
CRMP2 S522A KI mice (Yamashita et al., 2012)
were provided by Dr. Yoshio Goshima (Kanagawa, Japan) and rederived to
generate CRMP2 KI and corresponding WT mice (see Supplemental figure
2). Germline transmission was confirmed by genotyping for the loxP
allele in CRMP2f/f mice, and by Sanger sequencing for the A
to G substitution in S522A KI mice.

Induction of EAE
Eight-week CRMP2f/f:Cre+/− mice were administered
tamoxifen (TAM, 100 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) for 5
consecutive days to generate CRMP2 cKO mice.
CRMP2f/f:Cre−/− mice received identical
treatment and served as WT controls. EAE reagents were purchased from
Hooke Laboratories (EK-2110). In brief, 10-week-old mice (9 days after
TAM treatment) were injected with 200 µg of MOG35–55
peptide emulsified in CFA (two 100 µl subcutaneous injections into
adjacent areas in one hind limb). Two hours later, mice received an
i.p. injection of pertussis toxin (PT; 125 ng in 100 µl
phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]), then 24 hr later a second PT
injection. Clinical signs were scored as follows: 0 = no
clinical signs, 1 = limp tail,
2 = impaired righting (unable to return to
upright position after placed on back), 3 = paresis of one
hind limb, 4 = paresis of two hind
limbs, and 5 = death. Scoring was
performed every other day at the same time and by the same
investigator blinded to allocation. For analysis of variance (ANOVA),
if a mouse died or was sacrificed its last score was carried forward
till the end of the study.

Immunohistochemistry
Mice were euthanized with carbon dioxide then transcardially perfused
with ice-cold PBS. Brains were removed, dissected sagitally at
midline, and one hemisphere postfixed in 4% PFA for 48 hr, followed by
2 days in 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. The other hemisphere was
dissected into regions (CB, cerebellum; CTX, cortex) and kept frozen
at −80°C till use. Sections (20 µM) were prepared starting at midline.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done in cortical areas extending from
−1.0 to −2.5 mm relative to Bregma, containing retrosplenial CTX
(rCTX); and above the lateral ventricle, extending from 0.5 to 2.0 mm
relative to Bregma, which contains motor cortex (mCTX). Spinal cords
were removed, and lumbar areas (L1–L4) from four mice processed for
IHC and from four mice frozen at −80°C till use. Primary antibodies
were rabbit monoclonal anti-CRMP2 (1:1,000, Abcam Cat# ab129082,
RRID:AB_11154701), rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba1
(1:1,000, Wako Cat# 019-19741, RRID:AB_839504), rat monoclonal anti-CTIP2 (1:100,
Abcam Cat# ab18465, RRID:AB_2064130), and rat monoclonal B2.210
anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:1,000, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Cat# 13-0300, RRID:AB_2532994) (Trojanowski et al., 1986).
Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody, washed 3
times in PBS for 5 min each, then incubated in rhodamine red- (RRX) or
fluorescein- (FITC) conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1,000, Vector
Laboratories) in blocking solution. Negative control sections were
prepared without primary antibody. Sections were counterstained with
DAPI, then mounted with Vectashield® H-1000 mounting medium (Vector
Laboratories). Images were collected on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope
equipped with an MRm camera using a 40× objective. This provides a
field of view of 0.16 mm2 of which .09 mm2 is
captured by the camera. Axiovision 4.7 software parameters were set to
define positive staining versus background values, obtained from the
same regions in negative control sections. A cutoff value >10
µm2 was used to identify cell bodies and processes
positively stained for GFAP or Iba1. Staining was quantified in
sagittal sections through the cerebellum, with at least four sections
per animal and three animals per group, and presented at % area
stained.

Immunoblot Analysis
Tissues were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich R0278) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche 11836153001). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and
protein concentration measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay (Cat# PI23225, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Samples
were loaded on 4% to 20% Novex® gels (Cat# EC60285BOX, Thermo Fisher
Scientific). Proteins were transferred for 1 hr at 100 V using TGS (25
mM Tris pH = 8.5, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% [mass/vol] sodium dodecyl
sulfate), 20% (vol/vol) methanol as transfer buffer to polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes 0.45 µm (Cat# IPVH00010, Millipore,
Billerica, MA), preactivated in pure methanol. After transfer,
membranes were blocked at room temperature for 1 hr with tris-buffered
saline with Tween 20 (TBST; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1%
Tween 20) containing 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk, then incubated
separately with the indicated primary antibodies (Table 1)
in TBST containing 5% (mass/vol) bovine serum albumin, overnight at
4°C. Following incubation in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies from Jackson Immunoresearch, blots were revealed
by enhanced luminescence (WBKLS0500, Millipore) before exposure to
photographic film. Films were scanned, digitized, and quantified using
Un-Scan-It gel version 6.1 scanning software by Silk Scientific Inc
(Orem, UT). CRMP2 phosphorylation levels were normalized to total
CRMP2 levels measured in the same sample, and total CRMP2 levels were
normalized to β-actin levels measured in the same sample.

Electron Microscopy Analysis of Axonal Damage
Mice were prepared for transmission electron microscopic analysis as
previously described (Dupree and Feinstein, 2018). Mice were
transcardially perfused with 0.1 M Millonig’s buffer containing 4%
paraformaldehyde and 5% glutaraldehyde. Following 2 weeks of aldehyde
postfixation, lumbar spinal cords were harvested, rinsed in 0.1M
cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide, rinsed in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer, dehydrated in serial dilutions of ethanol, and
embedded in PolyBed 812 resin (PolySciences, Warrington, PA).
Ultrathin (70 nm) sections from the lumbar spinal cord levels L2–L3
were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and imaged using a
JEOL JEM 1400Plus transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA)
equipped with a Gatan OneView CMOS camera (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton,
CA). To assess the extent of axonal degeneration, a minimum of 15
electron micrographs (10,000× magnification) were collected per mouse
from the lateral columns within 100 µm of the peripheral surface of
the cord. These images were used to determine the relative percent of
axons undergoing degeneration. Axon degeneration was quantified
employing a modification of a classification scheme (Recks et al.,
2013) we previously employed (Dupree et al., 2015). Axons
were considered damaged if they exhibited one or more of the
following: (a) myelin profiles lacking an axon (axolysis, due to
either vacuolization or condensation), (b) axonal profiles with an
electron dense cytoplasm resulting from dense packing of the
cytoskeleton (increased neurofilament density), (c) swollen axons
lacking preserved organelles and neurofilaments, (d) axons with
swollen mitochondria or mitochondria with disrupted cristae, and (e)
axons with obvious loss of contact to myelin.

RNA Isolation
RNA was isolated from whole cerebellum, hippocampus, lumbar spinal cord,
and from cerebral cortex from −4 to +3 mm relative to Bregma, which
includes visual, somatosensory, parietal, retrosplenial, and motor
cortex, cingulate and orbital areas, using Direct-zol RNA MicroPrep
(Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) according to instructions. RNA quality was
determined using a 4200 TapeStation Instrument (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA), and all samples had RNA integrity values above 8.

Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total RNA (1 µg) was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher 4368814). The
cDNA was amplified with specific primers using FastStart Universal
SYBR Green Master mix (Applied Biosystems, 04913914001) in a Corbett
RotoGene real time PCR machine (Qiagen). Relative mRNA levels were
calculated from threshold take-off cycle number and normalized to
values measured for β-actin in the same samples. Primers were as
follows:

CRMP1-forward: 5′-CAGCGTGTCAGGATCAGAAG-3′

CRMP1-reverse: 5′-TTGGTGTTTAGAAGGCGAGG-3′

CRMP2-forward: 5′-CTGACCAGGGAATGACATCC-3′

β-actin-forward: 5′-CCTGAACTACCCCATTGAACA-3′

β-actin-reverse: 5′-CACACGCAGCTCATTGTAGAA-3′

Data Analysis
Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Pair-wise
comparisons (quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] data; IHC
for GFAP and Iba1; axonal damage) were made using Kruskal–Wallis
nonparametric analysis. Comparisons of immunoblot data were made using
one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc tests. Clinical scores were compared
using two-way repeated measures ANOVA and Sidak post hoc analysis.

Results
Generation of Neuronal Conditional Knockout of CRMP2
Neuronal CRMP2 knockout (cKO) mice were generated by administering
tamoxifen (100 mg/kg per day for 5 days, i.p.) to 8-week-old
CRMP2f/f CamK2aCreER(T2)+/– mice;
CRMP2f/f CamK2aCreER(T2) –/– mice treated
identically served as WT controls. Two weeks later, exon III deletion
was confirmed in the CNS, but not in spleen or tail of
Cre+/− cKO mice (Figure 1(a) and (b)). qPCR
analysis (Figure
2(a)) showed lower levels of CRMP2 mRNA in CTX, HC, and
CB, but not in SC of cKO mice. The partial reductions may be due to
CRMP2 expression in CamK2a negative neurons as well as in non-neuronal
cells. In contrast, relative levels of CRMP1 mRNA were not
significantly reduced in any of the cKO samples, although there were
modest, but nonsignificant increases observed in CTX and HC.
Immunostaining for CRMP2 showed less staining of granule neurons in
the dentate gyrus of the HC (Figure 2(b)), slightly less
staining of deep cerebellar neurons in the white matter of the CB
(Figure
2(c)) but no changes in staining of SC neurons (Figure 2(d)).
Less CRMP2 staining was observed in neurons in the retrosplenial
cortex (Figure
2(e)) and the motor cortex (Figure 2(f)). Costaining for
Ctip2 (COUP-TF interacting protein 2, a marker of upper motor neurons
(Arlotta et al., 2005) showed that CRMP2 was depleted from descending
motor neurons (Figure
2(g)).

from the WT allele; 1,525 bp from the loxP flanked allele;
and 693 bp when exon III is deleted.

CRMP2 cKO Reduces EAE Disease Severity
Two weeks after tamoxifen treatment, WT and cKO mice were immunized with
MOG35−55 peptide. Disease incidence was not affected
by genotype and reached 100% in both male and female mice (Figure 3(a) and
(c)). In females, average disease onset was not affected
by genotype (15.8 ± 1.0 vs. 14.1 ± 1.5 days; WT, cKO); while in males,
onset was slightly but not significantly delayed in the cKO mice
(13.6 ± 1.2 vs. 15.8 ± 1.5 days; WT, cKO). In female WT mice (Figure 3(b)),
disease severity increased between Days 10 and 20 after which there
was a slight reduction (however, it was not significant when WT data
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA). Disease severity was significantly
reduced in cKO mice (two-way ANOVA), which increased after Day 15 but
more gradually than in WT mice. In contrast to females, disease
severity in male mice was similar in WT and cKO groups (Figure 3(d)).
Since only the female cKO mice showed reduced disease severity,
further studies were done using samples from female mice.

Figure 3. CRMP2 cKO reduces EAE severity. WT and CRMP2 cKO mice were
immunized with MOG35–55 peptide. Disease
incidence reached 100% in both (a) female and (c) male
mice and was not affected by genotype. (b) In female mice
(n = 9 cKO; n = 11
WT), disease severity was significantly reduced in the cKO
mice (Time × Genotype F[10, 180) = 2.484,
p = .0082, two-way rmANOVA).
*p < .05 versus WT (Sidak’s

statistical significance—Time × Genotype,
F(10, 150) = 1.442,
p = .167. Data are combined from
two independent studies. WT = wild-type; cKO = conditional
knockout.

Assessment of neuroinflammation done at the end of the study (Figure 4(a))
shows that both astrocyte (Figure 4(b)) and microglial
(Figure
4(c)) activation was reduced in the cerebellum of cKO
mice compared to WT mice, a site of significant glial activation in
EAE (Smith and
Eng, 1987; Carter et al., 2007; Qin et al.,
2012; Gentile et al., 2018; Rossetti et al., 2018).
However, in the spinal cord (Figure 4(c)), where
significant inflammation and demyelination occurs in this EAE model
(Lassmann
and Bradl, 2017), the extent of GFAP and Iba1 staining
was similar in WT and cKO mice, with a nonsignificant modest increase
of Iba1 staining in the cKO mice (Figure 4(d)). Despite the
absence of reduced glial cell activation in the spinal cord, EM
analysis (Figure
5(a)) revealed a significant reduction in the percentage
of damaged axons in the lateral columns of lumbar spinal cord of cKO
mice (Figure
5(b)), which are a mix of descending vestibulospinal and
corticospinal motor tracts, and descending spinothalamic tracts (Watson and
Harrison, 2012). In contrast, there were no differences
in plots of g-ratio versus axon caliber (Figure 5(c)) between the WT
and cKO EAE mice; nor any differences in average g-ratio, axonal
caliber, or myelin thickness (Figure 5(d)).

(n = 3, female cKO), and 2.2
(n = 3, female WT). Sections were
stained for GFAP (green) and Iba1 (red), and counter
stained with DAPI (blue). The % area stained for GFAP and
Iba1 was significantly reduced in the cerebellum (b) but
not in the spinal cord (d). Data are

Effects of CRMP2 cKO on CRMP2 Phosphorylation
The beneficial actions of CRMP2 in several disease models have been
ascribed to alterations in its phosphorylation state, since
Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation at serine 522 (S522), and subsequent
GSK3β phosphorylation at threonine 509 and 514 (T509/514, which
requires S522 phosphorylation) inhibits CRMP2 interactions with target
proteins including tubulin, calcium channels, and NMDA receptors
(Moutal
et al., 2019b). To directly test if pS522 plays a role in
regulating disease severity, we carried out one study using S522A KI
and corresponding congenic WT mice (Yamashita et al., 2007) in
which phosphorylation at S522 is prevented. EAE was induced in
10-week-old female KI and WT female mice and disease monitored for 4
weeks (Figure
6). Disease incidence reached 100% in the WT mice and 88%
in the KI mice (Figure 6(a)), and the average day of disease onset was
similar (13.1 ± 0.5 days vs. 12.3 ± 0.3 days; WT, KI). In the WT
group, disease severity increased to Day 16 reaching an average score
of 2.7 ± 0.4, after which it did not significantly change reaching
3.0 ± 0.5 at the end of the study (Figure 6(b)). In contrast,
while the initial development of disease severity in KI mice was
similar to that of the WT mice, reaching an average score of 2.8 ± 0.6
on Day 15, at later times it was significantly less than the WT mice,
diminishing to 1.8 ± 0.5 on Day 26, F(13,
169) = 2.70, p = .0018. Immunoblot analysis of CRMP2
phosphorylation sites (Figure 7(a) and (b))
confirmed that levels of pS522 and pT509/514 were virtually absent
from the KI cerebellum (Figure 7(c)) and spinal cords
(Figure
7(d)).

Discussion
We previously showed that treatment with the CRMP2 modulator LKE reduced
disease severity and axonal damage (Dupree et al., 2015) in MOG
peptide induced EAE. Among other proteins, LKE can bind to CRMP2 (Hensley et al.,
2010a). This suggests that beneficial actions of LKE in EAE may
be mediated, at least in part, to increases in CRMP2 activity. Our findings
that LKE exerts direct neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects (Marangoni et al.,
2018) prompted us to develop a neuronal CRMP2 cKO mice to
explore the roles of neuronal CRMP2 during EAE. In female mice with
homozygous neuronal CRMP2 cKO, disease severity was reduced, while in males,
although initial disease progression was slightly delayed, it eventually
reached similar severity in WT and cKO mice.

Few studies have examined the consequences of CRMP2 depletion from brain.
Global knockout of CRMP2 led to cognitive and behavioral deficits in adult
mice, suggesting a role for CRMP2 in neuropsychiatric disorders (Nakamura et al.,
2016). Brain-specific conditional knockdown of CRMP2 using
nestin-Cre mice to drive deletion during early neural development also led
to deficits in neuronal development and behavioral impairment in the adults
(Zhang et al.,
2016). Both global knockout and conditional brain cKO mice
showed dysregulation and disorganization of dendritic spine development and
patterning (Makihara
et al., 2016), which could account for subsequent behavioral
deficits. In our studies, CRMP2 deletion was initiated by treatment with
tamoxifen at age 8 weeks, 2 weeks prior to induction of EAE. Although we did
not yet examine those mice for changes in dendritic complexity or behavior
deficits, it is possible that such changes occurred during the short time
period and contributed to our findings. However, to our knowledge, the
current results represent the first report examining the role of CRMP2 in a
model of a neurodegenerative disorder.

IHC staining and qPCR measurements using tissues from naïve (nonimmunized mice)
done 2 weeks after treatment with tamoxifen show that CRMP2 expression was
reduced, but not eliminated in the HC, CB, and CTX, but not the SC of the
cKO mice. Similarly, IHC showed less staining of neurons in the dentate
gyrus of the HC, in the white matter of the CB, and in the retrosplenial CTX
which lies above the HC. IHC showed strong depletion of CRMP2 from neurons
in the motor cortex which were identified as descending motor neurons by
staining for CTIP1, a transcription factor selectively expressed in
corticospinal motor neurons and a subset of spinal motor neurons (Yasvoina et al.,
2013). In contrast, IHC carried out in sections from the lumbar
SC did not reveal any obvious reductions in CRMP2 staining. Although these
analyses were not quantified, the combination of qPCR and IHC findings is
consistent with CamK2a expression which is high in CTX, HC, and CB but low
in SC (Kolker et al.,
2012; Gamazon et al., 2018). The partial reductions may also be due,
in part, to CRMP2 expression in other cell populations including astrocytes
and oligodendrocytes, as well as in non-CamK2a expressing neurons. In
addition, since the efficacy of cre-recombinase is typically less than 100%,
CRMP2 levels may be reduced, but not absent, in CamK2a expressing
neurons.

In this study, EM analysis evaluated ultrastructural alterations in the lateral
columns of lumbar spinal cord levels L2 and L3. These columns contain
descending spinothalamic (sensory), vestibulospinal (motor), and
corticospinal (motor) tracts (Watson and Harrison, 2012). As
expected, we observed extensive axonal damage in the WT EAE mice with
approximately 40% of counted axons having one or more indices of damage, as
compared to a basal level of axonal damage (about 3%) present in
sham-immunized mice (Dupree et al., 2015). In cKO mice, axonal damage was reduced
to about half of that seen in the WT mice, suggesting that CRMP2 contributes
to EAE-induced axonal pathology. Despite the reduction of axonal damage, IHC
staining for GFAP and Iba1 did not reveal any reduction of glial activation
in the lumbar spinal cord of cKO mice, suggesting that effects on
neuroinflammation within the spinal cord did not account for reduced axonal
damage. Consistent with this, measurements of axonal caliber and myelin
thickness did not show any differences between the WT and the cKO EAE mice.
Since MOG35–55 peptide EAE largely models a chronic inflammatory
encephalopathy (Lassmann
and Bradl, 2017), these data suggest that neuronal CRMP2 cKO
provides benefit to neurons without affecting inflammatory-induced
demyelination in the spinal cord.

Evaluation of CRMP2 expression by qPCR and IHC staining did not show any
reduction in the spinal cords of cKO mice; this may be due to lower levels
of CamK2a expression in spinal cord neurons (Kolker et al., 2012; Gamazon et al.,
2018). In contrast, qPCR of whole cortical samples showed less
CRMP2 mRNA in the cKO mice, and IHC identified fewer CRMP2 stained neurons
in the motor cortex. These observations suggest that reduced degeneration of
spinal cord axons in CRMP2-cKO mice might be associated with protection of
corticospinal motor neurons. Mechanistically, the beneficial effect of CRMP2
deletion on EAE-induced degeneration of spinal cord axons may result from
preservation of the axon initial segment (AIS), an axonal domain responsible
for initiation of the action potential (Buffington and Rasband, 2011). It
has been shown that disruption of AIS integrity (number and average length)
occurs in EAE mice, associated with increased microglial activation and
Ca2+ entry (Clark et al., 2016, 2017). Increased
Ca2+ can activate a variety of proteases including
calcineurin and calpain-I which have been shown to cause AIS disruption
(Schafer et al.,
2009; Benusa
et al., 2017). Since CRMP2 interactions with NMDARs and CaV2.2
channels modulate calcium influx into neurons, lower CRMP2 levels in
descending motor neurons could lead to reduced Ca2+ influx,
reduced protease activation, and maintenance of AIS and fiber integrity.

In this study, we also examined the importance of CRMP2 phosphorylation on the
development of EAE. pCRMP levels are higher in brains of AD patients
compared to controls (Cole et al., 2007; Soutar et al., 2009; Williamson et al.,
2011; Hensley and Kursula, 2016), increased in patients with Lewy
body dementia (Xing
et al., 2016), and are increased after spinal cord injury
(Nagai et al.,
2016). In neurons, pCRMP2 expression increased due to
excitotoxicity (Hou
et al., 2009), and in rats, pCRMP2 levels increased in response
to intracerebroventricular administration of LPS or TLR4 agonists, and
following induction of focal ischemia (Li et al., 2018). We focused
attention on CRMP2 phosphorylation occurring at serine 522, a site where
reducing or preventing phosphorylation has been shown to mediate
neuroprotection and induce axon repair in a number of models of disease and
injury. Inhibition of Cdk5, or use of a nonphosphorylatable S522A CRMP2
vector, reduced neurite growth defects in hippocampal cells (Crews et al.,
2011); CRMP2 S522A KI mice have reduced impairment of synaptic
plasticity due to Aβ (Isono et al., 2013), show delayed Wallerian degeneration
(Kinoshita et al.,
2019) and increased axonal regeneration (Kondo et al., 2019) due to optic
nerve injury; have reduced axonal degradation of dopaminergic neurons in an
MPTP model of Parkinson’ disease (Togashi et al., 2019); and have
delayed motor neuron damage in a transgenic mouse model of ALS (Numata-Uematsu et al.,
2019). We found that in CRMP2 S522A KI mice, while disease
progression was similar until Day 15 in the KI mice as in their WT controls,
after that time disease severity continued to gradually increase in the WT
mice while in the KI mice severity significantly lessened. These results
suggest that the S522A KI does not affect initial events in the development
of EAE which involve T cell activation and migration into the CNS, but
instead influences later events such as activation of innate immune
responses in parenchymal tissue or neuronal damage. Interestingly, a
proteomic analysis comparing CRMP2 S522A to WT mice showed increases in
several proteins, including oligodendrocyte proteins MAG, MOG, and PLP
(Nakamura et al.,
2018). Since CRMP2 is expressed in adult OLGs and OPC (Dawson et al.,
2003; Piaton et al., 2011; Syed et al., 2011; Fernandez-Gamba et al.,
2012; Syed
et al., 2017), it is possible that in the S522A mice effects in
OLGs or OPCs also contributes to reduced EAE severity.

Other phosphorylation sites on CRMP2 also have important roles in regulating
axonal damage and regeneration. In particular, CRMP2 phosphorylation at
threonine 555 (T555) plays an important role in regulating the extent of
axonal damage mediated via signaling through the Nogo receptor (ngr1). In
mice with deletion of ngr1, EAE severity was lessened and was associated
with preservation of axonal health and myelin integrity (Petratos et al.,
2012). In the optic nerve, axonal transport was impaired in the
ngr1 null mice, as were interactions of CRMP2 with the axonal motor protein
kinesin-1 (Lee et al.,
2019), which are increased upon CRMP2 phosphorylation.
Moreover, overexpression of a nonphosphorylatable CRMP2T55A also reduced
optic nerve axonal degeneration (Lee et al., 2019), showing a
critical role for CRMP2 T555 in mediating axonal damage during EAE. In this
study, although we ran immunoblots to measure pT555, we were not able to
detect this epitope in either spinal cord or cerebellar samples; it remains
to be determined if pT555 levels are altered in the optic nerves of CRMP2
cKO EAE mice. We also assessed phosphorylation at CRMP2-Y32, which is
increased upregulated following spared nerve injury (Moutal et al., 2019a),
and regulates growth cone collapse (Uchida et al., 2009); however, we
did not see any change in pY32 in either the CRMP2 cKO mice or the CRMP2 KI
mice, suggesting this site may have limited roles during EAE.

CRMP2 roles in axonal guidance were first demonstrated by screening for
proteins involved in the collapsin pathway, mediated by Semaphorins (Goshima et al.,
1995), and which showed that in response to Semaphorin 3A,
CRMP2 induces collapse of the axonal growth cone. CRMP2 was then shown to
induce axon elongation and neurite extension, involving binding to tubulin
dimers which are transferred to the growing plus end of microtubules (Fukata et al.,
2002), as demonstrated by findings that during nerve
regeneration, CRMP2 overexpression accelerates axon regeneration and neurite
extension (Suzuki
et al., 2003). CRMP2 binding to tubulin, as well as to other
proteins, is regulated by phosphorylation at Serine 522 by cyclin dependent
kinase-5 Cdk5 (Uchida
et al., 2005; Moutal et al., 2019b), which in
turn is permissive for phosphorylation at Thr509, 514, and 518 by GSK3β
(Cole et al.,
2004). Phosphorylation at these sites reduces CRMP2’s affinity
for tubulin heterodimers, thus reducing microtubule growth and causing axon
retraction. In addition to tubulin, CRMP2 also interacts with CaV2.2, the
presynaptic N-type voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) (Khanna et al.,
2007; Brittain et al., 2009; Moutal et al., 2016c, Moutal et al.,
2018b), which regulates neuronal excitability and has roles in
neuropathic pain (Francois-Moutal et al., 2015; Xie et al., 2016; Moutal et al.,
2017a; Chew and Khanna, 2018; Francois-Moutal et al., 2018;
Moutal et al.,
2018a). CRMP2 targets CaV2.2 to neuronal membranes (Brittain et al.,
2009; Brittain et al., 2011b) and enhances CaV2.2 currents required
for transmitter release (Chi et al., 2009). In MS, the α1B subunit of CaV2.2
accumulated in damaged axons in areas of actively demyelinating lesions,
suggesting that Ca2+ influx contributes to axonal damage (Kornek et al.,
2001). Increased α1B expression was also observed in
demyelinated axons in a rat model of optic neuritis, and treatment with
ω-conotoxin (a selective inhibitor of CaV2.2) reduced axon and myelin damage
(Gadjanski et al.,
2009). In MOG-peptide EAE, α1B null mice had reduced clinical
signs and less demyelination (Tokuhara et al., 2010), and
ziconotide (selective CaV2.2 blocker) reduced clinical signs and
neuroinflammation (Silva
et al., 2018). Together, these findings suggest that reducing
CRMP2 could lead to reductions in Ca influx and lessen axonal damage. CRMP2
also interacts with GluN2B containing NMDA receptors (Bretin et al., 2006; Moutal et al.,
2014), and disruption of those interactions using CRMP2 derived
peptides reduced NMDA-R mediated currents providing neuroprotection against
excitotoxicity in animal models of ischemia and traumatic brain injury
(Brittain et al.,
2011a, 2012; Brustovetsky et al., 2014). These mechanisms that could
contribute to the beneficial effects in CRMP2 cKO mice are summarized in
Figure 8.

Figure 8. Possible mechanisms underlying reduced neuropathology in CRMP2 cKO
mice. In cKO mice, CRMP2 remaining in CamK2a expressing neurons,
and CRMP2 expressed in other cells, shows reduced
phosphorylation at both S522 and T509/514. Reduced
phosphorylation at S522 could be due to reduced Cdk5 activity,
as suggested by results showing an increase in the relative
levels of the Cdk5 modulator p35 to p25 (although increases in
selective phosphatases could also play a role). Conversion of
p35 to p35 is mediated by calpain-1, which is converted from an
inactive to active form requiring intracellular Ca2+.
Lower CRMP2 levels will reduce Ca2+ influx through
the N-type voltage gated calcium channel (CaV2.2), thereby
reducing calpain-1 activation. CRMP2 regulation of the
NMDA-receptors (NMDA-R) will also be reduced in cKO cells,
leading to lower glutamate dependent Ca2+ influx,
formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and reduced
neurotoxicity. These events may be occurring in descending motor
neurons, thereby reducing damage to the axon initial segment
whose disruption can contribute to axonal damage.

In summary, our findings demonstrate that CRMP2 deficiency from neurons can
reduce the severity of disease in the MOG35–55 peptide induced
EAE model of MS, which was associated with decreases in axonal damage in
spinal cord tracts. These effects may be mediated, at least in part, by
reduced CRMP2 in upper motor neurons, whose fibers traverse through the
cerebellum and comprise descending cortico-spinal tracts. Evaluation of
glial activation revealed a reduction of astrocyte and microglial activation
in the cerebellum of cKO mice, but not in the spinal cord. Neuroinflammation
in MOG35–55 peptide induced EAE in mice primarily occurs in white
matter tracks of the cerebellum, brainstem, and in the optic nerves (Lassmann and Bradl,
2017), which contrasts to what occurs in MS patients where
neuroinflammation is observed in subcortical areas. It therefore will be
important to extend the current findings to other CNS regions and other
models of MS disease. Our findings using S522A KI mice show that disease
severity is also reduced in the absence of CRMP2 phosphorylation at serine
522, consistent with other studies showing reduced pathology in these mice;
however, additional studies are needed to determine if glial activation or
axonal damage is also lessened in the KI mice. Together our results
demonstrate that modulating CRMP2 expression or phosphorylation state can
provide benefit in EAE and suggest that actions on CRMP2 mediate, at least
in part, the effects of LKE observed during EAE.
