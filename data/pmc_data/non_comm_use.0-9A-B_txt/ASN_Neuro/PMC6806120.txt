neural stem cells (NSCs) and reduced postnatal NSC pools are observed
in both the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus (DG) of GD3-synthase
knockout (GD3S-KO) mouse brains. Specifically, deficiency of GD3 in
GD3S-KO animals revealed a dramatic reduction in cellularity in the DG
of the hippocampus of the developing mouse brain, resulting in severe
behavioral deficits in these animals. To further evaluate the
functional role of GD3 in postnatal brain, we performed rescue
experiments by intracerebroventricular infusion of ganglioside GD3 in
adult GD3S-KO animals and found that it could restore the NSC pools
and enhance the NSCs for self-renewal. Furthermore, 5xFAD mouse model
was utilized, and GD3 restored NSC numbers and GM1 promoted neuronal
differentiation. Our results thus demonstrate that exogenously
administered gangliosides are capable to restore the function of
postnatal NSCs. Since ganglioside expression profiles are associated
not only with normal brain development but also with pathogenic
mechanisms of diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, we anticipate
that the administration of exogenous gangliosides, such as GD3 and
GM1, may represent a novel and effective strategy for promoting adult
neurogenesis in damaged brain for disease treatment.

Introduction
Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are located primarily in the subgranular zone
(SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus and the subventricular
zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles of the brain. NSCs are fundamental
cells that can differentiate into various types of cells in the developing
nervous system, and, in mature brain, for adult neurogenesis. It has been
suggested that NSCs contribute to repairing damaged or degenerated central
nervous system (CNS). Throughout neural development, dynamic changes are
observed in the composition of carbohydrate-rich molecules, including
gangliosides.

Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingolipids expressed primarily,
but not exclusively, in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of cells of
all vertebrates. Those gangliosides are particularly abundant in the nervous
system. Ganglioside metabolism is closely associated with brain development.
We have reported that GD3 is the predominant ganglioside species in NSCs
(Nakatani et al.,
2010) and modulates NSC proliferation by interacting with
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling (Wang and Yu, 2013). GD3-synthase
(sialyltransferase II, ST-II; GD3S) is responsible for catalyzing the
biosynthesis of GD3, a key intermediate for the synthesis of other b- and
c-series gangliosides. In GD3S gene knockout (GD3S-KO) mice, all b-series
gangliosides, including GD3, GD2, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1b, are deleted, and
a-series gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a, and GM2 show accretion (Okada et al.,
2002). In postnatal brain, GD3 is required for the long-term
maintenance of NSCs (Wang et al., 2014). Deficiency in GD3 leads to developmental
and behavior deficits, such as depression. The synthesis of GD3 is switched
to the synthesis of complex, brain-type gangliosides, notably GM1, GD1a,
GD1b, and GT1b, resulting in terminal differentiation and loss of “stemness”
of NSCs. We have reported that efficient histone acetylation of
glycosyltransferase (GT) genes contributes to the developmental alteration
of ganglioside expression in mouse brain (Suzuki et al., 2011).
Furthermore, we have demonstrated that acetylation of histones H3 and H4 on
the GM2/GD2S gene promoter leads to recruitment of
trans-activation factors Sp1 and AP-2 during neuronal
differentiation (Tsai
and Yu, 2014). Recently, we found that nuclear GM1 binds with
acetylated histones on the promoters of the GM2/GD2S gene
as well as on the neurogenic transcription factor, NeuroD1
gene, in differentiated neurons (Tsai et al., 2016). In this
process, GM1 is augmented by a novel GM1-modulated epigenetic gene
regulation mechanism of GTs at a later differentiation stage. Consequently,
these studies suggest that stage-specific gangliosides play specific roles
in maintaining NSC activities and in cell fate determination.

Neurons and glia are generated in the CNS by a defined temporal sequence in
early developmental stages. Postnatally, most of the SVZ disappears except
along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles, where it is considered as
a NSC niche in the adult state. Although neurogenesis mostly arises at the
time of the development in most adult mammals, it continues to occur at a
much slower pace and in a limited manner throughout the entire adult life.
In the adult brain of mammals, neurogenesis persists primarily in two
germinal zones: the SVZ of the lateral ventricles (Doetsch et al.,
1997, 1999) and the SGZ in the DG of the hippocampus (Suhonen et al.,
1996; Seri
et al., 2001). It is hypothesized that an accelerated loss of
the NSC pool is one of the mechanisms for transition from normal aging to
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2019;
Tobin et al.,
2019). In AD brains, neurogenic impairments may underlie, at
least in part, the progressive loss of memory and compromised ability to
learn and process new information are characteristic of the disease. Both
olfactory and hippocampal dysfunction might be enhanced by compromised
neurogenesis in the SVZ and in the DG, respectively.

In this study, we provide evidence that treatment of damaged brain by
gangliosides could bring about enhancement of the self-renewal capability of
endogenous NSCs and to promote adult neurogenesis in vivo.
Understanding the roles of gangliosides on NSC functions in living animals
should pave the way for developing novel strategies for promoting neural
repair in pathologically damaged brains, such as in AD, Parkinson’s disease,
and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Materials and Methods
Materials
GD3 and GM1 used in this study were isolated from either bovine
buttermilk or brains in our laboratory by established procedures
(Ledeen and
Yu, 1982; Ren et al., 1992; Ariga et al.,
1994).

Animals
GD3S-knockout (KO) mice: The original GD3S-KO mice and
their wild-type (WT) mates were kindly provided by the courtesy of Dr.
Richard Proia (NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD) and crossed to generate the
heterozygous mice. Then, the heterozygous male and female mice were
mated, and PCR screening was performed for genotyping. Littermates
were used as controls. Six-month-old male GD3S-KO mice and their WT
litter mates were used in this study. Animals were divided into three
groups: (a) WT with saline infusion group; (b) GD3S-KO with saline
infusion group; and (c) GD3S-KO with GD3 infusion group. AD
model mice: Mice expressing five mutations in human
amyloid precursor protein and presenilin1 (5xFAD)
(B6SJL-Tg[APP*K670N*M671L*I716V*V717I, PSEN1*M146*L286V]6799Vas/J)
under the Thy1 promoter were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Ten-week-old male 5xFAD mice and their WT liter mates were used in
this study. Animals were divided into five groups: (a) WT with saline
infusion group; (b) 5xFAD with saline infusion group; (c) 5xFAD with
GD3 infusion group; (d) 5xFAD GM1 infusion group; and (e) GD3 infusion
plus GM1 infusion group. Each group consisted of three to four animals
(n = 3–4). Mice were
anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (40
mg/kg body weight) and xylazine hydrochloride (4 mg/kg body weight)
and then fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus. Mini-osmotic pumps (MOPs)
were employed (ALZET, model #1007D, Cupertino, CA) for lateral
ventricular infusion with a 7-day duration at a flow rate of 0.5
µL/hr. Mice in the GD3 or GM1 infusion group were given 5 mg/kg
bodyweight/day GD3 or GM1, respectively. Mice in the saline infused
group were given the same volume of sterilized saline.
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administrated intraperitoneally
immediately after the MOP was installed, at 50 mg/kg body weight, 3
times a day at 4-hr intervals for 7 days.

Immunohistochemical Staining
Mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). After perfusion, brain blocks with SVZ were removed and
postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 24 hr. The blocks were
then equilibrated in sucrose (30% in PBS) and embedded in optimal
cutting temperature compound and kept frozen at −80°C. Cryosections
were cut at a thickness of 30 μm. Sections were incubated in 1N HCl at
0°C for 5 min and 2N HCl at 37°C for 15 min and washed with PBS before
immunohistochemical staining. Sections were then blocked in 3% normal
donkey serum in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min and further
incubated in the following primary antibodies 4°C overnight: BrdU
(mouse, 1:200, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, G3G4), SOX2
(rabbit, 1:200, Cell Signaling Technology, #2748), doublecortin (DCX;
goat,1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, C-18). After three washes with
PBS, the samples were incubated in an appropriate secondary antibodies
coupled to Alexa488 or Alexa 568 (Invitrogen) at a dilution of 1:1,000
at room temperature for 2 hr. After washing with PBS for 3 times, the
sections were mounted with Vectashield mountain medium with DAPI
(Vector Laboratory).

Confocal Microscopy and Cell Counting
Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal
microscope. Pictures were taken under 20× and 63× Plan-Apochromat
objective. Eight sections with DAPI, BrdU, and SOX2 or DCX triple
staining between Bregma 0.6 mm to Bregma 0.1 mm which contained the
dorsal lateral part of SVZ, or between Bregma −1.22 mm and Bregma
−4.52 mm which contained the DG were used for cell counting. The
number of DAPI+, BrdU+, SOX2+, and DCX+ cells in the noninfusion side
SVZ was counted with Image J software. The percentage of BrdU+, SOX2+,
and DCX+ cells versus DAPI+ cells, as well as BrdU, SOX2
double-labeled cells versus DAPI+ cells and BrdU DCX double-labeled
cells versus DAPI+ cells were calculated.

Statistical Analysis
Data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean. Analyses of
significant difference were performed using one-way analysis of
variance. A p value of .05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Results and Discussion
GD3 Restores BrdU+/SOX2+ Cells in SVZ and Hippocampus
Mammalian neurogenesis commences during early embryonic stages and is
almost complete shortly after birth. Neurogenesis continues to occur
at a much slower pace and in a limited manner throughout the entire
adult life. Neurogenesis persists primarily in two germinal zones: the
SVZ of the lateral ventricles (Doetsch
et al., 1997, 1999) and the SGZ in the DG of the
hippocampus (Suhonen et al., 1996; Seri et al., 2001), in the
adult brain of mammals. With regard to gangliosides, we have shown
that GD3 is the predominant ganglioside in NSCs, and it can serve as a
convenient cell surface marker of these cells (Nakatani et al., 2010). The
interaction of GD3 with EGFR plays a crucial role in maintaining the
self-renewal capacity of NSCs by directing the EGFR through the
recycling pathway rather than through the degradative pathway after
endocytosis (Wang
and Yu, 2013). The cellularity at the SVZ and DG of
GD3S-KO mice were significantly reduced compared with that of their WT
littermates (Wang
et al., 2014). Previous findings indicated that there are
progressive reductions of the NSC pool in the SVZ and DG in adult
GD3S-KO mice.

GD3 is the predominant ganglioside species in NSCs and in early
development of brains. The synthesis of GD3 is switched to the
synthesis of complex, brain-type gangliosides, notably GM1, GD1a,
GD1b, and GT1b, resulting in terminal differentiation and loss of
“stemness” of NSCs (Figure 1). Compare to WT mice, GD3S-KO mice showed
thinner SVZ with reduced cellularity (DAPI+ cells), consistent with
our previous results (Wang et al., 2014).
Although the absolute numbers of BrdU+ and SOX2+ cells were reduced in
GD3S-KO mice compared with age-matched WT animals, there was no
significant difference of the percentage of BrdU+ versus DAPI+ cells
and SOX2+ cells versus DAPI+ cells among different groups. This
observation suggested that the reduction of the number of BrdU+ and
SOX2+ cells was due to the reduction of the whole cellular pool. To
investigate the functional roles of GD3 in postnatal brains, GD3S-KO
mice were utilized. GD3 was intracerebroventricularly (icv) infused
into adult (6-month-old) GD3S-KO mice employing a mini-pump for 7
days. In the SVZ of GD3S-KO mice, BrdU+ newly generated and SOX2+
self-renewal or multipotent cells were less than that in the WT
control (Figure
2). On the other hand, GD3 treatment increased SOX2+
self-renewal or multipotent cells in the SVZ of GD3S-KO mice (Figure 2). In
both neurogenic regions, SVZ and DG of GD3S-KO mice, the number of
BrdU+/SOX2+ newly generated multipotent cells was significantly
increased following GD3 infusion (Figure 3). These data
indicate that infusion of GD3 could restore NSCs in SVZ and DG to
maintain their properties at early NSC stages.

GD3 Restores BrdU+/SOX2+ Cells in AD Model Mice
The loss of NSCs is known to occur during normal aging, and it has been
hypothesized that an accelerated loss of the NSC pool is one of the
mechanisms for transition from normal aging to AD (Moreno-Jimenez
et al., 2019; Tobin et al., 2019).
Therefore, promotion of endogenous neurogenesis has been suggested as
an important target for treatment and prevention of AD (Mu and Gage,
2011; Choi et al., 2018). The 5XFAD transgenic mice is an AD
model with two point mutations in presenilin1 (M146L & L286V) and
the Florida (I716V), London (V717I), and Swedish (KM670/671NL)
mutations in the amyloid precursor protein. The 5XFAD mice are
utilized as a preclinical AD mouse model extensively. 5xFAD mice
showed significantly decreased percentage of BrdU and SOX2 double
labeled cells versus DAPI+ cells compared to WT mice (Figure 4). To
examine the physiological roles of GD3 on postnatal neurogenesis in
the DG of AD model mouse, GD3 was administered into the 5XFAD mouse
brain. GD3 infusion augments self-renewal and the multipotent marker,
SOX2-expressing newly generated cells in the DG (Figure 4). These data suggest
that icv infusion of GD3 can be an effective means to promote
neurogenesis in AD model brain.

Figure 4. GD3 restores the number of SOX2+ cells and GM1 restores DCX+
neuronal cells in the DG of 5xFAD. GD3 and GM1 were
introduced into the brains of (10-week-old) 5XFAD mice
(via icv for 7 days by micro-osmotic pump) and then
injected with BrdU to assess its neurogenic potential with
co-staining of lineage-associated markers. For the
combinational experiment, GD3 was first infused for 7 days
and then GM1 was infused for 7 days.

GM1 Promotes Neuronal Differentiation in AD Model Mice
During neuronal differentiation, the concentration of GD3, which is the
predominant ganglioside in NSCs, is rapidly decreased. Concomitantly,
the levels of “brain-type” gangliosides such as GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and
GT1b continuously increase in young animals, reaching a plateau during
adulthood (Hirschberg et al., 1996; Ngamukote et al., 2007;
Suzuki
et al., 2011). These pattern changes follow closely with
the upregulation of GM2/GD2S expression (Ngamukote et al., 2007).
The dramatic changes in the expression profile of gangliosides clearly
reflect the biological needs of GalNAc-containing ganglio-series
gangliosides at particular stages of brain development. Throughout
neuronal development, GM1-expressing cells are considered as neuronal
progenitor cells and neurons (Maric et al., 2003; Liour et al.,
2005; Androutsellis-Theotokis et al., 2010). To investigate
the functional roles of GM1 on postnatal neurogenesis in the DG of AD
model mouse, GM1 was administered into the 5XFAD mouse brain. GM1
increases BrdU+/doublecortin+ (DCX+) newly generated immature neuronal
cells in 5XFAD mouse brains (Figure 4). As expected, the
combinatorial infusion (GD3 and GM1) had a synergistic effect.

Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of gangliosides to treat CNS
disorders has been tried and failed (Svennerholm et al., 1990;
Flicker
et al., 1994). It is well known that gangliosides form
micelles and are normally not permeable through the blood–brain
barrier. Svennerholm and his collaborators described that icv
administration of GM1 to AD patients could stop the continuous
deterioration of nerve processes and increased the turnover of
transmitter substances (Svennerholm et al., 2002).
So far, icv administration is the most reliable method to deliver
gangliosides into the brain of AD and other disease models (Dodge et al.,
2015; Alpaugh et al., 2017). Our ganglioside infusion
experiments clearly indicated that exogenous gangliosides are acting
functionally on NSCs in vivo. We chose this route
(icv) to ensure the successful delivery of gangliosides into the brain
to modulate the cell fate of endogenous NSCs in vivo.
Studies are in progress to determine whether gangliosides can also be
introduced by less invasive ways, such as intranasal (Fine et al.,
2015) or pulsed ultrasound (Carpentier et al.,
2016).

In conclusion, we showed that icv infusion of gangliosides GD3 and GM1
simultaneously could enhance neurogenesis in adult mouse brain. For
promoting adult hippocampal neurogenesis, GD3 restored NSC pools and
that GM1 enhanced neuronal differentiation at DG of AD model mouse
brain. We have reported that the GD3 containing microdomains initiate
and facilitate the EGF signaling in cultured NSCs (Wang and Yu,
2013). We have also reported that GM1 promotes neuronal
differentiation by an epigenetic regulatory mechanism (Tsai and Yu,
2014; Tsai et al., 2016). Further studies are in progress to
determine whether injection of specific gangliosides, such as GD3,
GM1, and their analogs, could represent a novel and effective adjuvant
strategy for the treatment of AD, Parkinson’s disease, and related
neurodegenerative diseases by promoting adult neurogenesis.
