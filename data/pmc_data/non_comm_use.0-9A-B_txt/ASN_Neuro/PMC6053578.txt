(particle size ≤0.1 µm) particulates can trigger innate inflammatory responses
in the lung and brain depending on particle composition. Most studies of manmade
toxicants use inhalation exposure routes, whereas most studies of allergens use
soluble solutions administered via intranasal or injection routes. Here, we
tested whether continuous inhalation exposure to aerosolized Alternaria
alternata particulates (a common fungal allergen associated with
asthma) would induce innate inflammatory responses in the lung and brain. By
designing a new environmental chamber able to control particle size distribution
and mass concentration, we continuously exposed adult mice to aerosolized
ultrafine Alternaria particulates for 96 hr. Despite induction
of innate immune responses in the lung, induction of innate immune responses in
whole brain samples was not detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction
or flow cytometry. However, exposure did trigger decreases in Arginase 1,
inducible nitric oxide synthase, and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA in the
brainstem samples containing the central nervous system respiratory circuit (the
dorsal respiratory group, ventral respiratory group, and the pre-Bötzinger and
Bötzinger complexes). In addition, a significant decrease in the percentage of
Toll-like receptor 2-expressing brainstem microglia was detected by flow
cytometry. Histologic analysis revealed a significant decrease in Iba1 but not
glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in both the brainstem and the
hippocampus. Together these data indicate that inhalation exposure to a natural
fungal allergen under conditions sufficient to induce lung inflammation
surprisingly causes reductions in baseline expression of select innate immune
molecules (similar to that observed during endotoxin tolerance) in the region of
the central nervous system controlling respiration.

==== Body
Introduction
For much of the 20th century, the brain was viewed as immunologically separate from
the rest of the body (reviewed in Carson et al., 2006; Perry, 2010; Czirr and Wyss-Coray, 2012; Cunningham, 2013). However, triggering
acute or chronic systemic inflammation with viral, bacterial, and manmade toxicants
is now well described to induce innate immune responses within the central nervous
system (CNS) (Perry,
2010; Cunningham,
2013; Calderón-Garcidueñas et al., 2016; Cole et al., 2016; Heusinkveld et al., 2016; Mumaw et al., 2016; Jayaraj et al., 2017; Bilbo et al., 2018; Ljubimova et al., 2018).
Less studied are the neuroinflammatory consequences of airborne allergens (Klein et al., 2016).

Airborne allergens trigger both acute and chronic pulmonary inflammation and rhinitis
in a large proportion of the human population at times in which the brain is still
developing (childhood) through times in which the brain is at increased
susceptibility for neurodegenerative disease (e.g., as with advancing age; Ghosh et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2016; Croston et al., 2018; Kader et al., 2018).
Indeed, in animal model systems, chronic exposure to allergens has revealed
consequences for altered behavior including impaired learning and memory in the
Morris water maze, disturbed long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region,
and reduced cell proliferation in the hippocampal neurogenic niche (Guo et al., 2013; Klein et al., 2016). As
yet, it is unknown to what extent altered behavior might be due to innate
(nonlymphocyte) immune responses versus adaptive (lymphocyte) immune responses in
the CNS.

Because systemic (non-CNS) exposure to bacterial components triggers an innate (non-T
cell) immune response in the CNS, it is expected that pulmonary innate immune
responses to allergens would similarly trigger innate inflammation in the CNS.
However, immune responses to antigens including allergens are dependent on the route
of administration, the composition of the antigen, and whether antigens are
administered in the presence or absence of immune activating adjuvants. In the case
of antigens administered via inhalation, the size of the aerosolized particulates
also can modulate the immune response (Kumar et al., 2014; Jayaraj et al., 2017; Ljubimova et al., 2018). Most studies
examining the CNS consequences of allergic inflammation use neither natural
allergens nor an inhalation route of exposure. Instead they most often use
repetitive injections of nonallergen antigens often in the presence of adjuvants.
The repetitive treatment with adjuvant-antigen cocktails is especially confounding
because adjuvants by themselves can trigger neuroinflammatory responses in the CNS
(Perry, 2010; Czirr
and Wyss-Coray, 2012;
Cunningham, 2013).

Natural allergens are characterized by multiple characteristics (Kumar et al., 2014). They
are proteins often stably desiccated and delivered as part of a larger particle.
They are low molecular weight, able to be eluted from the larger particle in the
wet environment of the lung, are recognized by
pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors on innate immune cells, and
often have protease activity. However, many studies focusing on the consequences of
allergic inflammation use model systems in which the adaptive immune system (T
cells) are primed to respond to a nonallergen antigen such as ovalbumin by
repetitive intravenous, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous injections in the presence
of adjuvant over a period of 1 to 3 months. The allergic adaptive immune response is
triggered in these model systems by subsequent acute or chronic intranasal
administration of the antigen in solution (Ploix et al., 2009; Doherty et al., 2012; Klein et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016). Natural allergen
exposure usually occurs by continuous low-dose exposure in the absence of
adjuvant-based priming. Substantially, different inflammatory mechanisms are known
to be triggered by this type of administration frequency than by single or multiple
discrete deliveries of high antigen doses (Kumar et al., 2014; Bonam et al., 2017). Furthermore, with an
intranasal treatment, the mouse is subjected to either the stress of restraint or
anesthesia while held in a supine position as a micropipette is placed at the
external nares and a concentrated solution is trickled in slowly (Ploix et al., 2009; Doherty et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2016). Thus,
it is likely that pathologic mechanisms elicited by intranasal application
(±sensitization) may not be representative of natural inhalation exposure to
environmental airborne allergens.

Several studies have examined the consequences of inhalation exposure to natural
allergens, including plant pollens, fungal allergens, and arthropod antigens, but
the focus of these studies has primarily been on induction of pulmonary inflammation
(Knutsen et al.,
2012; Gabriel et al.,
2016; Gold et al., 2017; Kubo, 2017). By contrast, most studies
examining the CNS consequences of inhalation exposure have focused on the effects of
airborne pollutants instead of allergens (Gackiere et al., 2011; Levesque et al., 2011;
Calderón-Garcidueñas et al.,
2016; Cole et al.,
2016; Heusinkveld
et al., 2016; Mumaw
et al., 2016; Jayaraj
et al., 2017; Bilbo
et al., 2018; Ljubimova et al., 2018). These studies demonstrate that in the absence
of priming, the inhalation route of exposure is effective at inducing both systemic
and CNS inflammatory responses. While the composition of these airborne toxicants is
an important determinant in triggering inflammation, particle size is also an
important determinant. In animal models as well as in human epidemiological studies,
it is apparent that pollutants in the fine (particle size ≤2.5 µm) and ultrafine
(particle size ≤ 0.1 µm) size range are highly implicated in contributing to
observed effects on the CNS.

Taken together, these types of studies have clearly demonstrated the potential for
allergic responses to modify the inflammatory environment and potentially the
function of the CNS. However, as yet, the CNS consequences of natural airborne
allergens administered via inhalation are infrequently examined. Therefore, here we
chose to test the consequences of continuous inhalation exposure to fungal
Alternaria alternata particulates. Alternaria
alternata is a known common allergen found to thrive on various types
of vegetation. It is virtually impossible to avoid contact with Alternaria
alternata as its spores can reach levels of thousands of spores per
cubic meter of air and can be found both indoors and outdoors (Knutsen et al., 2012; Gabriel et al., 2016). As a general health
risk, Alternaria alternata is considered one of the most abundant
sources of airborne allergens, readily triggers immune sensitization and is a
primary risk factor for development of asthma. Furthermore, Alternaria
alternata exposure in previously sensitized individuals is correlated
with severe increased risk of morbidity and a higher risk of fatal asthma attacks
(Bush and Prochnau,
2004; Knutsen et al.,
2012; Gabriel et al.,
2016; Vianello
et al., 2016). It is also a major allergen for asthma in children raised
in desert environments and natural exposure to Alternaria alternata
spores also induces allergic rhinitis symptoms (Halonen et al., 1997; Andersson et al., 2003; Bush and Prochnau, 2004;
Knutsen et al.,
2012; Gabriel et al.,
2016).

Finally, studies examining the consequences of airborne exposure to manmade toxicants
have demonstrated that CNS inflammation is triggered prior to the development of a
mature adaptive immune response (occurring ≥96 hr of exposure). By contrast, studies
focusing on the CNS consequences to allergens have focused primarily on the
consequences of chronic or long-term inflammation comprising ongoing adaptive immune
responses driving innate immune responses (Doherty et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014; Kubo, 2017). The type
of innate inflammation induced by the initial exposure to an immune stimulant shapes
qualitatively and quantitatively the subsequent T cell, B cell, and antibody
responses to the initial immune stimulant (Kumar et al., 2014).

Therefore, in this study, we designed and constructed a new whole-body exposure
chamber that allows us to conduct in vivo continuous exposure
studies for inhaled toxicants. Exposure times in other model systems are often
limited to repetitive short-term exposures (e.g., 4–5 hr per day for 3–5 days per
week for a periods up to several months; Roy et al., 2003; Roy and Pitt, 2006; McDonald et al., 2010; Barnewall et al., 2015;
Ye et al., 2017). By
contrast, whole-body exposures could be continuous over days because the
construction parameters of our new whole-body chamber system maintained ammonia
levels well below levels required for optimal murine husbandry (Rosenbaum et al., 2009). Using this
model system, we can investigate health effects of aerosolized materials without
restricting animal movement or feeding behavior. This system provides controlled and
well-characterized whole animal exposures where dosage is by inhalation of particle
suspensions that more closely mimics natural airborne exposure in contrast to the
more commonly used intranasal applications of dilute solutions of particulate
material or movement-restricting nose cone administration of inhaled particulates
(Roy et al., 2003,
2006; McDonald et al.,
2010; Barnewall
et al., 2015; Ye
et al., 2017). Using this chamber, we describe the effects of continuous
extended exposure to fine particle Alternaria allergen aerosol
suspensions on inflammation in the lung and CNS. To our knowledge, this study is the
first to test the consequences of this prevalent health-related airborne allergen on
the brain’s innate immune status. Strikingly, we find that despite inducing overt
lung inflammation with eosinophilia characteristic of innate immunity preceding
allergic (hypersensitivity type 1) lymphocyte responses, we did not induce
proinflammatory innate immune activation with the brain (Doherty et al., 2012; Ghosh et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014; Kubo, 2017). Instead,
we observed a decrease in basal expression of select innate immune molecules in the
region of the brain regulating respiration reminiscent of the phenomenon associated
with endotoxin tolerance (Nomura
et al., 2000; Pena
et al., 2011; Rajaiah
et al., 2013; Collins
and Carmody, 2015).

Material and Methods
Animals
Male C57Bl/6J mice (8–12 weeks old) were maintained in standard mouse cages with
fresh bedding and standard Purina food chow for the duration of each
experimental exposure. All experiments were performed in compliance with
University of California Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee regulations
and review.

Mouse Chamber
The chamber was made of clear acrylic sheets with internal dimensions of
40 × 32 × 25 in.3 (length × width ×height) for approximately 540 L in
volume (Figure 1).
Inside the chamber, two perforated aluminum plates separated the inlet (upper
left) and the outlet (lower right) to enable uniform dispersion of injected
aerosols. The large size of the chamber accommodates up to six mouse cages
simultaneously for exposure tests. On the top of the chamber, an LED warm light
string was attached to a timer switch to provide a 12:12 hr light cycle. The
whole chamber was covered with blackout cloth to ensure zero light contamination
from outside. A &frac14; in. inlet from the upper left of the chamber was
used for injection while four &frac12; in. exhaust ports located in the
lower right chamber ensured that the in-chamber pressure remained the same as
atmospheric. Another &frac14; in. outlet located in the lower right of the
chamber was used for instrument sampling and monitoring. The chamber was flushed
with clean air with at least 10 chamber volumes before and after each test to
avoid contamination.

Aerosol Generation
Lab compressed air passed through a clean air system consisting of silica gel (to
absorb water moisture), activated carbon (to absorb organics), hopcalite (to
absorb CO), and purafil (to absorb NOx). Pressure at both the inlet and outlet
of the clean air system was monitored and controlled by a pressure regulator.
During the test, the inlet pressure remained controlled at 60 psi while the
outlet pressure was 25 psi, resulting in an aerosol flow at 6 L/min (monitored
by a mass flow controller) coming out of the nebulizer. The nebulizer converted
Alternaria liquid particulate solution into an aerosol
spray (May, 1973) and
the spray went through a diffusion dryer for physical absorption of water
vapor.

Sample Monitoring System
Four instruments were attached from the sample port of the chamber. Aerosol
concentration and size distribution were monitored by a Scanning Mobility
Particle Sizer (SMPS). The SMPS is widely used as a standard method for the
characterization of particles smaller than 1 µm in diameter (Wang and Flagan, 1990;
Mulholland et al., 2006). It provides size from 2 to 1,000 nm with high
resolution (107 channels). A Condensation Particle Counter was used to measure
airborne particle number concentration for the SMPS to provide overall particle
size distribution. The Laser Aerosol Particle Sizer served as a supplemental
instrument for monitoring particle size ranging from 200 nm to 40 µm with high
resolution of up to 128 channels. A DustTrak (TSI) provided information about
the total PM2.5 concentration. A modified ammonia (NH3)
analyzer provided measurements of the NH3 level inside the
chamber.

Operation of the Chamber: Biological Material Introduction and Dose
Preparation
Lab compressed air passed through a clean air system before entering an atomizer.
A stainless steel atomizer generated aerosols from a 0.26 g/mL solution of
Alternaria particulate in ultrapure water. The wet aerosol
passed through a heated copper coil at 52°C to transform water moisture into
vapor and the water vapor was absorbed by passing through a diffuser dryer
filled with indicating silica gel, which was replaced daily. The dry aerosol was
subsequently injected into the mouse chamber. The chamber held mice in
conventional mouse cages with wire tops to hold food as well as enable free flow
of air into the cages, and hydrogel containers in the bottom to provide water
along with conventional wood shaving bedding. Injected aerosols were shown to
saturate the chamber with Alternaria particulates by 2 hr of
continuous injection. In this study, tests continued for 96 hr with continuous
aerosol injection. During the injection period, instruments monitored the
aerosol concentration and size distribution as well as the overall particulate
matter (PM) concentration. To ensure that mice would not be affected by lung
irritation from ammonia accumulation within the chamber during the time of the
experiment, we used continuous air injection at a rate greater than 1 full
volume change per hour. At the end of the exposure period, ammonia levels were
monitored to ensure that the mice were under a nontoxic environment. The chamber
was flushed with clean air of at least 10 chamber volumes before and after each
test to avoid contamination.

Lung Histology and Bronchio-Alveolar Lavage Cell Counts
Bronchio-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells and fluid were recovered through
intratracheal washing with 0.75 mL of ice-cold PBS as previously described
(Chen et al.,
2016). Cells were recovered by centrifugation followed by red blood
cell lysis. BAL cells were then counted, cytocentrifuged (1,000 RPM, 5 min) onto
a glass microscope slide, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and
differential counts performed based on cell morphology and stain. For each
sample, >150 cells were counted from five total frames of view spread
throughout the microscope slide at 40× magnification. Following BAL washing,
lungs were inflated with 0.75 mL 1 part 4% PFA/30% sucrose and 2 parts OCT and
stored overnight in 4% PFA at 4°C for lung histology and immunofluorescence.
After 24 hr, lungs were removed from 4% PFA and incubated another 24 hr in 30%
sucrose. Lungs were then blocked in OCT and sectioned at 10 µm. H&E-stained
lung sections were blindly scored at 20× magnification on a 1 to 5 scale with 5
being the most severe score of pathology using criteria of leukocyte
infiltration and aggregation of leukocytes into the bronchioles (1–5) and
vascular inflammation/endothelial cell hyperplasia (1–5) visualized by
thickening of endothelial cells surrounding the vasculature for a total score
out of 10 as previously described. Scoring of the lung section was based on the
total area affected: 1, absent; 2, slight; 3, moderate (covering up to 5% of
total area), 4, marked (>5% and <10% of total area), and 5, severe
(covering ≥10% of total area). For immunofluorescence staining, sections were
incubated with rabbit anti-resistin-like molecule alpha (RELMα) (0.5 mg/mL
Peprotech), at room temperature for 2 hr. Then sections were incubated with the
appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hr at room
temperature and counterstained with DAPI. Sections were visualized under a Leica
microscope (DM5500 B).

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
Greiner 96-well plates were coated with primary antibodies to RELMα (Peprotech,
1µg/mL) overnight at room temperature. After blocking the plates with 5% newborn
calf serum in PBS for 1 hr, sera, BAL fluid, or tissue homogenates were added at
various dilutions and incubated at room temperature for 2 hr. Detection of RELMα
was done with biotinylated antibodies (Peprotech, 2.5 µg/mL) for 1 hr, followed
by incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase (Jackson Immunobiology) for 1 hr in
the dark. The peroxidase substrate tetramethylbenzidine (BD Biosciences) was
added followed by the addition of 2N H2SO4 as a substrate
stop, and the optical density (OD) was captured at 450 nm. Samples were compared
to a serial-fold dilution of recombinant protein.

Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis
In brief, the medulla and the rest of the brain from each mouse were separately
homogenized and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) as previously described (Hernandez et al., 2016). Following RNA
extraction, first-strand cDNA was synthesized per the conditions outlined in the
cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Only samples with RNA
and cDNA quality verified by the presence of ribosomal bands and appropriate
levels of hypoxanthine guanine phophoribosyl transferase (HPRT) transcripts per
µg cDNA were used for subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
analysis. qPCR analysis was performed as previously described using a CFX96 Real
Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The
relative number of transcripts per HPRT transcripts was determined using
calibration standards for each of the tested molecules. For each molecule being
assayed, a qPCR standard curve was also generated to define the correspondence
of transcript numbers to the cycle threshold (Ct value) for qPCR detection.
Specifically, standards for HPRT and each molecule being assayed were diluted to
obtain standard curves of 50 pg, 5 pg, 0.5 pg, 0.05 pg, 0.005 pg, 0.0005 pg, and
0 pg (no template control) for qPCR determination of transcript levels in each
sample. The transcript copy number of each molecule per sample was normalized to
the expression of HPRT per sample to account for minor variations in sample
aliquots. Primers for HPRT: (forward) CCCTCTGGTAGATTGTCGCTTA and (reverse)

Flow Cytometry
Microglia and CNS-infiltrating macrophages were isolated from the brains and
medulla oblongata of mice immediately following euthanasia as previously
described (Hernandez et al.,
2016). In brief, the brain with cerebellum was separated from the
brainstem at the level of the border between the pons and the medulla (medulla
region containing the dorsal respiratory group, the ventral respiratory group,
and the Bötzinger and pre-Bötzinger complexes; Smith et al., 2013; Feldman and Kam,
2015). Both brain regions (the whole brain without medulla and the
medulla) from each mouse were mechanically dissociated as separate samples.
Samples were not pooled and were not treated with DNAse or collagenase. The
resulting cell suspensions were separated on a discontinuous 1.03/1.088 Percoll
gradient and microglia/macrophages/infiltrating immune cells were collected from
the interface as well as from the 1.03 Percoll fraction. Microglial activation
was analyzed by flow cytometry using a Cell Quest-equipped FACSCalibur (BD
Scientific) and fluorescently conjugated antibodies: Allophycocyanin
(APC)-conjugated CD45, fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated FcR and phycoerythrin
(PE)-conjugated antibodies against Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid
cells-2 (TREM2), Fc Receptor (FcR), CD11b, and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) (BD
Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Microglia were defined as CD45lo,
FcR+ cells. Flow cytometric data were quantified using FlowJo software using
standard methodologies for identifying gated populations and mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) values (Allan
and Keeney, 2010). Because baseline fluorescence values are not
absolute values between experiments, all MFI values were normalized to untreated
male mice. MFI values for the CD45lo, FcR+ cell population were
calculated for each activation marker using FlowJo software.

Histology
Brain tissue collected at dissection was immediately incubated at 4°C for 24 hr
in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by 48 hr in 4% paraformaldehyde/30% sucrose
solution. Tissue was cryopreserved, cryosectioned (25 µm) onto Fischer
Superfrost plus slides and exposed to rabbit anti-Iba1 antibodies (Wako) and
murine anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) antibodies (Invitrogen
Thermofisher), followed by incubation with Alex-680 conjugated goat anti-rabbit
and Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Invitrogen Thermofisher) as
previously described (Ploix
et al., 2011). Tissue sections were mounted in Prolong Gold
containing DAPI and subsequently imaged on a Yokogawa spinning disc confocal
microscopy system. Immunofluorescence was quantified (6 mice per condition, 2
brain sections per mouse) with NIH Image J (version 1.5K) using the Mean Gray
Value tool (sum of the gray values of all pixels in specific fluorescent channel
divided by the number of pixels in the specific fluorescent channel in the total
image). Specifically, the CA1 region of the hippocampus in the stratum radiatum
(−1.5 to −2.5 mm past bregma on a sagittal plane) and the dorsal medulla,
ventral to the fourth ventricle (−5.5 to −6.5 mm past bregma on a sagittal
plane).

Statistical Analysis
Values are reported as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM),
with sample size as reported in each assay. Student’s t test or
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Dunnett’s multiple comparison test
were used to analyze data as indicated using Prism7 (Graphpad Software, La
Jolla, CA). No significant differences were detected in the standard deviation
of populations being compared by ANOVA (Brown-Forsythe test
p = .9516). In all data sets, sample comparisons with
p values less than .05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
Production of Stable Aerosol Suspensions of Alternaria
Nanoparticles in an Environmental Chamber
Here, we report a mouse environmental chamber able to provide continuous air
injection with the capability to inject a stable suspension of particulates or
other aerosol components over an extended period (Figure 1). Figure 1(a) depicts the chamber system
and Figure 1(b) depicts
representative TSI DustTrak data showing relatively even distribution of test
particles across the chamber. The chamber and injection characteristics were
subsequently characterized along several parameters, including aerosolized
particle size and concentration, stability in aerosol suspension within the
chamber, and ammonia levels (Figures 2 and 3). Specifically, aqueous solutions of
Alternaria particulate at different concentrations were
injected through an atomizer and the resulting aerosolized particle suspension
was analyzed. The concentration of particles in the chamber was dependent on the
Alternaria solution concentration (Figure 2(a)).

aerosol particles (sampled through a low-pressure impactor that collects

To characterize the stability of the particle suspension, several studies were
conducted with no mice present in the chamber while particle concentration and
distribution were monitored using the SMPS system. Particles in the chamber were
found to show an average peak particle size of approximately 100 nm regardless
of the concentration of aqueous solutions of Alternaria
particulate (Figure
2(a)) or the presence of mice in the chamber (Figure 2(b)). Figure 2(a) and (b) also shows that the
average particle number concentration of two separate injections of aqueous
solution (0.26 g/L) in the chamber were nearly identical with or without the
presence of mice. The mass concentration of the particles in the chamber under
continuous injection conditions remained relatively stable overtime with the
slight variations possibly reflecting minor variation in air pressure in the
injection system (Figure
2(c)). While there was a range of particle sizes (Figure 2(a) and (d)), the
average particle size appeared to be a property of the
Alternaria particulate rather than the concentration of the
protein. Thus, as with the comparisons between empty chamber and the chamber
with mice, the chamber conditions did not affect the particle size,
concentration, or stability.

To confirm that appropriately low ammonia levels were maintained for the duration
of an experimental exposure treatment, we measured ammonia within the chamber at
the end of a full 96-hr exposure (Figure 3). Although precise upper limits
for murine exposure are debated, it has been generally accepted that human
exposure limits should not be exceeded for laboratory-housed rodents with 25
parts per million being the recommended exposure limit as an 8-hr time-weighted
average according to National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health
guidelines (Rosenbaum
et al., 2009). Here, we found that ammonia levels were significantly
lower than the recommended 25 parts per million even with six mice in the
chamber (levels were <200 parts per billion).

Figure 3. Ammonia level in the end of the 96-hr exposure. The ammonia
gas (NH3) concentration in the chamber was acquired at the
end of each 96-hr exposure experiment. The figure shows two different
ammonia (NH3) levels during the last 3 hr of an exposure
study with either three (dashed black line) or six (solid blue line)
mice in the chamber.

Continuous Exposure to Alternaria Particulate Nanoparticles
Induces Overt Pulmonary Inflammation
We initially quantified lung inflammation by standard bronchio-alveolar lavage
(BAL) and histology as the first site of allergen exposure (Figure 4). We found that 96 hr of
treatment was insufficient to trigger a statistically significant increase in
numbers of immune infiltrates in BAL with a standard regimen of daily intranasal
dosing of the Alternaria particulate solution (Figure 4(a) to (c), blue
bars). By contrast, 96 hr of continuous chamber exposure to aerosolized
Alternaria particulates was sufficient to cause significant
(∼60%) increases in the numbers of total lavage cells (Figure 4(a), red bar;
F = 8.853, p = .0162) and in total alveolar
macrophages (Figure
4(b), red bar; F = 9.314, p = .0145).
While inhalation exposure was more effective at triggering immune cell influx
into the lung, histological analysis revealed that both the intranasal dosing
regimen and continuous chamber exposure to aerosolized
Alternaria particulates triggered similar degrees of total
lung pathology (Figure
4(d) and (e)). Specifically, blinded scoring of histology confirmed
inhalation exposure to Alternaria particulates induced airway
and endothelial thickening equivalent to that induced by conventional intranasal
administration (F = 14.54, p = .0003).
Immunofluorescent staining for RELMα, a highly expressed protein in asthmatic
inflammation (Doherty
et al., 2012), revealed that both intranasal and inhalation exposure
to Alternaria induced modest expression in the airway and in
the lung parenchyma (Figure
4(c)). Quantification of RELMα induction in lavage-isolated cells by
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay revealed no significant differences between
treated and untreated groups (Figure 4(d)). Together, these studies show that physiological
exposure to Alternaria particles in the form of aerosols in an
atmospheric chamber is sufficient to produce pulmonary inflammation exhibiting
early signs of allergic-type innate immune responses.

Inhaled Alternaria Exposure Decreases Basal Level of Innate
Immune Molecules in Brain Medulla
We hypothesized that if continuous inhalation exposure to
Alternaria particulates was sufficient to trigger lung
inflammation, it should also be sufficient to trigger neuroinflammatory
responses within the brain. Therefore, we surveyed the expression of molecules
previously implicated in systemic- and emission particle-induced innate immune
responses: Arginase 1, iNOS, NOX2, TNFα, and IL-6 (Figures 5 and 6). Surprisingly, an
initial qPCR survey detected no significant differences in the expression of
these molecules in cDNA prepared from total brain tissue of mice plus/minus
Alternaria exposure (Figure 5). In the absence of global
differences detectable in total brain samples, we speculated that any effects in
the CNS might be localized to specific brain regions. We chose to examine the
brain region involved in the direct innervation and regulation of respiration
(Smith et al.,
2013; Feldman and
Kam, 2015). For all subsequent experiments, we dissected the medulla
containing the CNS respiratory circuit (composed of the dorsal
respiratory group, the ventral respiratory group, and the Bötzinger and
pre-Bötzinger complexes) away from the rest of the brain (Figure 6).

While no significant difference in Arginase 1 and iNOS expression levels was
detected in cDNA from the whole-brain samples of naïve and
Alternaria-exposed mice (Figure 5(a) and (b)), both arginase 1
(Figure 6(a);
t = 3.434, df = 20) and iNOS levels (Figure 6(b);
t = 2.293, df = 20) were significantly
decreased by ∼50% in cDNA from the medulla of
Alternaria-exposed mice as compared to cDNA from the medulla of
naïve mice. Arginase 1 and iNOS both compete for the same substrate: arginine.
Arginase converts arginine to ornithine leading to the polyamine pathways while
iNOS generates nitric oxide from arginine. Thus, the ratios of arginase 1 to
iNOS are often used as a diagnostic marker of a shift in innate immune
propensity for anti-inflammatory/tissue repair responses to a propensity for
proinflammatory cytotoxicity responses (Munder et al., 1998; Gordon, 2003;
Cho et al.,
2014). Therefore, we also compared the ratios of Arginase 1/iNOS per
mouse as a measure of altered polarization separate from the absolute levels of
each transcript. Exposure to aerosolized Alternaria
particulates did not cause significant changes in Arginase 1/iNOS ratios in
either the brain as a whole or in the medulla (Figures 5(c) and 6(c)). NAPDH oxidase
(gp91-phox subunit: NOX2), TNFα, and IL-6 are classic proinflammatory molecules
induced in the CNS by systemic inflammatory challenges and by CNS injury (Figure 6(d) to (f)). While
no difference in NOX2 and IL-6 expression was observed between the
Alternaria and ambient air-exposed mice (Figure 6(d) and (f)), the
mean baseline levels of TNFα were reduced by nearly 66% in the medullas of
Alternaria-exposed mice (Figure 6(e); t = 2.090,
df = 20).

Inhaled Alternaria Exposure Decreases Percentage of
Microglia Expressing Detectable TLR2
Systemic inflammation as well as inhaled pollutants can trigger infiltration of
peripheral immune cells into the CNS with even small (fine and ultrafine)
particulates in the size range, but with different composition than the
Alternaria particulates used here (Jayaraj et al., 2017). The most
quantitative method for characterizing the degree of immune cell influx is flow
cytometric analysis of CD45+ cells (Carson et al., 2006). In brief, all
nucleated cells of hematopoietic origin including microglia express CD45 (also
known as leukocyte common antigen). However, microglia express very low levels
of CD45 (CD45lo) while all other differentiated immune cells in the
adult express an order of magnitude higher CD45 levels (CD45hi). In
cell suspensions of the brain and medulla, microglia are identified as FcR+
(Figure 7(a), FL1-H)
and CD45lo (Figure
7(a), FL4-H). In all samples from naïve and
Alternaria-exposed mice (brain: Figure 7(a) and (b) and medulla: Figure 7(c)), no
CD45hi cells were detected (Figure 7(a) to (c)). Thus, there was no
overt peripheral immune cell infiltration in Alternaria-exposed
mice despite ongoing inflammation in the lung (Figure 4(a)).

additionally with PE-conjugated anti-CD11b antibodies are depicted in
magenta. Cell suspensions from brain without medulla (d to e) and from
only medulla (l to s) were similarly labeled with PE-conjugated
antibodies against TREM2, TLR2, and TLR4. The percentages of microglia
being immunoreactive for each molecule above background fluorescence
(background: gray population in (b) and (c)) and the mean fluorescence
intensity (relative expression level per microglia) were calculated in
FlowJo and graphed in Graphpad Prism. Data are represented as
mean ± SEM from a total sample size of
n = 6 (all parameters for brain without medulla)

df = 10; (m) t = 3.246,
df = 6; (p) t = 2.765,
df = 6. TREM2 = triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells-2; TLR = toll-like receptor.

By immunolabeling with PE-conjugated antibodies, we analyzed microglial surface
expression of PAMP receptors (CD11b, TLR2, and TLR4) which have been implicated
in neuroinflammatory responses to systemic inflammation and inhaled pollutants
(Jayaraj et al.,
2017). We also examined microglial expression of TREM2 as a marker of
general microglial activation. TREM2 expression is often induced by brain injury
while its expression is reduced by direct exposure to LPS and TNF (Schmid et al., 2009).
In the brain (Figure
7(b)) and in the medulla (Figure 7(c)) of naïve mice, nearly 100%
of microglia express CD11b (blue population is CD11b+, nonspecific
autofluorescence is gray population, Figure 7(b) and (c)). Moreover, 96-hr
treatment with aerosolized Alternaria particulates did not
alter the percentage of microglia expressing CD11b, TLR4, or TREM2 in either
brain or medulla cell suspensions (Figure 7(d), (f), (j), (l), (m), and
(r)). By contrast, the percentage of TLR2+ microglia in medulla cell
suspensions was decreased by ∼30% in Alternaria-exposed mice as
compared to naïve mice (Figure
7(p)). However, the level of TLR2 per TLR2+ microglia (MFI per
microglia) was not altered by Alternaria exposure (Figure 7(q)). While the
percentage of CD11b+ cells was not altered by Alternaria
exposure, CD11b levels per cell were increased by Alternaria
exposure in both the whole brain (Figure 7(e)) and in the medulla (Figure 7(m)). Although
quite modest and of uncertain biologic significance, chamber exposure did reduce
TREM2 levels per microglia in the medulla (Figure 7(o)).

Inhaled Alternaria Exposure Decreases Iba1 but Not GFAP
Immunoreactivity
Within the CNS, Iba1 is expressed by microglia and GFAP by astrocytes. Prior to
our studies, Klein et al.
(2016) challenged mice with a natural allergen from timothy grass and
observed a decrease in hippocampal microglial activation using histologic
measures. However, their methodology included repetitive administration of the
natural allergen as a solubilized antigen preceded by adjuvant priming.
Therefore, it is unclear whether the reduced microglial reactivity was due to a
mature lymphocyte response that evolved over weeks or the repetitive route of
administration. Here, we compared Iba1 and GFAP immunofluorescence in the
medulla (Figure 8(a) and
(b)) and hippocampus (Figure
8(c) and (d)) of mice exposed to ambient air (naïve, Figure 8(a) and (c)) or
aerosolized Alternaria particulates (chamber, Figure 8(b) and (d)) for
96 hr. Microglia and astrocytes in Alternaria-exposed mice
retained the characteristic stellate morphology observed in ambient air-exposed
mice. However, the mean immunofluorescence of Iba1 per image was significantly
reduced by nearly 50% in the hippocampus of Alternaria-exposed
mice and by nearly 30% in the medulla (Figure 8(e) and (g)). By contrast, mean
immunofluorescence of GFAP per image was not significantly reduced (Figure 8(f) and (h)).

Discussion
Exposure to airborne particulates (natural and manmade) is a major focus for
understanding environmental contributions to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying
asthma, cardiovascular disease, and neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
disorders (Dockery et al.,
1993; Kodavanti
et al., 2000; Pope
et al., 2002; Kodavanti et al., 2011; Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013). A central
theme in epidemiologic and mechanistic studies defining disease-promoting
contributions has been to define the links between air exposures and organ-specific
inflammatory responses likely to provoke maladaptive or disease-predisposing
conditions in lung, heart, and brain (Gackiere et al., 2011; Levesque et al., 2011;
Calderón-Garcidueñas et al.,
2016; Cole et al.,
2016; Heusinkveld
et al., 2016; Mumaw
et al., 2016; Jayaraj
et al., 2017; Bilbo
et al., 2018). Allergic lung inflammation is known to cause systemic and
organ-specific inflammation (Xia
et al., 2014). Therefore, based on studies defining the effects of
ambient manmade airborne toxicants and systemic inflammation inducing activation of
CNS innate immune responses, it is possible that natural allergens could also have
detrimental effects predisposing the brain for disease-predisposing conditions.

Studies examining the effects of natural allergens including plant pollens, fungal
allergens, and arthropod antigens have focused primarily on defining mechanisms of
allergic lung inflammation and propensity for chronic pulmonary diseases such as
asthma (Doherty et al.,
2012; Gabriel et al., 2016; Knutsen et al., 2012; Gold et al., 2017;
Kubo, 2017). The few
reports linking allergic lung inflammation and neuroinflammation have not examined
ambient exposure of allergens. Instead, these reports have relied on immune
sensitization protocols often in the presence of robust adjuvant-based priming of
allergic inflammation using well-characterized antigens such as ovalbumin which lack
the defining features of an allergens (Xia et al., 2014; Yamasaki et al., 2016). Most studies with
nonallergen antigens observed induction of proinflammatory innate immune responses
in the brain (Sarlus et al.,
2013; Yamasaki
et al., 2016). However, one study that did examine the consequences of a
natural allergen from Timothy grass looked at only the long-term neuroinflammatory
consequences of allergic inflammation stimulated by a solubilized antigen
administered in a long-term injection priming/intranasal challenge model system.
Striking in this system, microglial activation was reduced in specific regions of
the brains from treated mice (Klein et al., 2016). These studies have been useful in defining the
potential of allergic inflammation to drive neuroinflammation but have also provided
potentially conflicting results. In part, this may be because these studies rely on
strategies that may induce hypersensitivity immune responses that are unrelated to
natural allergens associated with unprimed exposure to allergens by continuous
period of inhalation (Kumar
et al., 2014). In addition, these studies have primarily examined
long-term allergic responses (>12 weeks of fully developed respiratory asthma
with fully developed adaptive immune responses; Xia et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2016).

In our current studies, we sought to use an experimental system that mimics chronic
environmental exposure to aerosolized particulates. Therefore, we generated and
characterized a novel murine exposure chamber equipped to disperse a natural fungal
allergen continuously and simultaneously to monitor sustained aerosolized dispersion
of the natural allergen. Specifically, our chamber is much larger (540 L) than other
reported chamber systems with (0.4 L or 16 L volumes) and thus able to house up to
18 mice at a single time without accumulation of high ammonia levels (Barnewall et al., 2015;
Ko et al., 2015). Our
chamber system also uses multiple instruments to characterize particle sizes ranging
from 2 nm to 40 µm, instead of using only one instrument to detect particles in the
range of 500 nm to 20 µm (Barnewall et al., 2015). In contrast to nose-only exposure systems that
limits the animal activities and only allow 2-hr exposed time for each test, our
chamber system allows continuous exposure to occur under conditions of free mobility
and normal access to food and water (Ye et al., 2017).

It is difficult to determine the actual absorbed dose of allergen in the lung,
whether it is applied intranasally or intratracheally as a solution or as a
nebulized aerosol. In this study, we chose a stable aerosol suspension
concentration, which we could set by using a fixed Alternaria
particulate concentration at the atomizer (in this case, 0.26 g/L). Thus, for each
exposure study, mice were placed in the chamber and the aerosol injection was begun,
and particle concentration and size were monitored to ensure a stable suspension.
This exposure was continued for 96 hr because 96 hr encompasses the entire period of
initial innate immune response to the allergen and after which lymphocytic responses
to the allergen become apparent. The nebulized Alternaria aerosol
particles were found to be an average size of approximately 100 nm. This size range
is within the size ranges of ultrafine PM0.1 and fine
PM2.5 particles of airborne toxicants demonstrated to provoke potent
inflammatory responses. Indeed, such fine aerosol particles are capable of
penetrating deep into the alveolar spaces in the lung (Barnewall et al., 2015; Jayaraj et al., 2017).
Therefore, continuous exposure to aerosolized Alternaria
particulates ensured wide distribution throughout the lung and avoided the known
artefactual ingestion of a large proportion of an allergen solution when applied
intranasally. In addition, continuous exposure over several days avoided the
immunoregulatory effects of inducing multiple short-term bursts of acute systemic
allergic hypersensitivity responses.

Proinflammatory innate immune responses are triggered within the CNS by systemic
inflammation induced by bacterial and viral stimuli as well as by sustained exposure
to airborne emission particulates in the size range of the
Alternaria particles used here (Jayaraj et al., 2017).

In our model system, we were struck by the ability of continuous inhalation of
aerosolized Alternaria particulates to drive lung inflammation that
was more robust than daily intranasal application of an Alternaria
particulate solution. Furthermore, it was notable that simple continuous inhalation
exposure without prior antigen sensitization and without the inclusion of priming
adjuvant was by itself sufficient to drive a large BAL inflammatory infiltrate
comprising a mixed population of macrophages, neutrophils, and eosinophils
characteristic of allergic responses. Therefore, it might be surprising or
alternatively it might be comforting that broad-spectrum proinflammatory responses
were not observed in the brain after exposure to this common natural airborne fungal
antigen in the presence of robust lung inflammation. However, the study by Klein et al. (2016) does
suggest that natural allergens albeit using an adjuvant priming/challenge model
resulted in decreased microglial activation as assayed by histologic measures.
Because mature Th2/IgE lymphocyte responses were fully developed at the 12-week time
point of their assay collection, the authors ascribed the reduction in microglial
activation to the sustained actions of a fully mature adaptive immune response.
Here, we report observations in the brainstem and hippocampus consistent with their
study (decreased Iba1 immunofluorescence, decreased expression of a subset of innate
immune markers) prior to the development of a fully mature lymphocyte and IgE
allergy response.

When considering the apparent lack of proinflammatory responses in the brain, it is
useful to place our observations in the context of endotoxin tolerance (also
referred to as LPS preconditioning; Nomura et al., 2000; Pena et al., 2011; Rajaiah et al., 2013; Collins and Carmody, 2015).
Endotoxin tolerance refers to the well-described phenomena where pretreatment of
immune cells or of an individual with a series of low-dose endotoxin
(lipopolysaccharide) treatments causes the cells or individual to become refractory
to subsequent endotoxin challenge. Phenotypically, macrophages treated to become
endotoxin tolerant express lower levels of many proinflammatory and PAMP receptor
molecules at baseline prior to subsequent endotoxin challenge. Indeed, initial
reports have ascribed endotoxin tolerance to the acquisition of an alternatively
activated (M2) innate immune status. In our studies, we did indeed see decreased
expression of TNFα and iNOS in brainstem tissue samples as well as decreased
expression of TLR2 on brainstem microglia. While these are indicative of a lower
propensity for a proinflammatory response to immune stimulants, a shift toward an
alternative or M2-polarized phenotype should result in an altered ratio of key
innate immune markers. Specifically, an alternative activation/M2 baseline
polarization should have been reflected in an increased Arginase1/iNOS ratio which
we did not observe (Munder
et al., 1998; Gordon, 2003; Cho et al., 2014). More recently, the
association of endotoxin tolerance with acquisition of an alternative/M2 innate
immune polarization is being revisited as in many paradigms Arginase 1 is decreased
as observed in our studies (Rajaiah et al., 2013).

Changes in baseline innate immunity and baseline microglial activation states can
have biological consequences for brain function and do have consequences for immune
surveillance of the brain’s cellular health, phagocytosis of cellular components,
and altered inflammatory responses to subsequent insults in many models (Tremblay and Majewska,
2011; Ji et al., 2013; Schafer et al., 2013). In the studies by Klein et al. (2016), decreased
microglial activation correlated with decreased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In
our study, the consequences of modifying the baseline innate immune state in brain
regions regulating respiratory control can only be speculated at this point (Feldman and Kam, 2015,
Smith et al., 2013).
However, the similarity of the changes in our study with those triggered by
endotoxin tolerance may suggest that the changes observed here have a similar
desensitizing function. Namely, to reduce the toxic effects of similar allergic
challenges at subsequent time points on critical brain regions such as the brainstem
regions controlling respiration.
