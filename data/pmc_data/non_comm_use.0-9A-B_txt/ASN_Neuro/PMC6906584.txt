Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is
accumulating evidence that in addition to genetics, other lifestyle and
environmental factors may have a share in the individual risk of getting AD,
which opens new opportunities for prevention (Mattson, 2015). Risk factors
include diabetes mellitus, midlife obesity and hypertension, smoking,
depression and dyslipidemia (Mayeux and Stern, 2012), and many
of these factors are considered potentially modifiable (Livingston et al.,
2017). Physical activity has especially been associated with a
reduced dementia risk in a variety of epidemiological studies (Scarmeas et al.,
2001; Santos-Lozano et al., 2016) and has been recently shown to
exert beneficial effects on cognition and AD pathology, even in individuals
with genetically driven autosomal dominant AD (Müller et al., 2018). It has been
predicted that ∼13% of AD cases can be attributed to physical inactivity and
that a 25% reduction in physical inactivity has the potential to prevent
nearly 1 million cases worldwide (Barnes and Yaffe, 2011).

One potential weakness of many epidemiological studies is that they mostly have
to rely on self-reported exercise frequencies, due to the fact that activity
profiles of the participating individuals can only be assessed in
retrospect. The use of transgenic AD mouse models could overcome this
problem as the lifespan of rodents is considerably shorter and housing
conditions can be adapted, ensuring better comparability and
reproducibility. Indeed, a vast literature reports on the beneficial effects
of physical activity, mainly embedded in enriched environment (EE)
paradigms, with regard to improved cognitive performance in, for example,
hippocampus-dependent tasks (Jankowsky et al., 2005; Nithianantharajah and
Hannan, 2006). In addition to an amelioration of behavioral
deficits, also changes on the brain structural level, such as increased
hippocampal volume (Hüttenrauch et al., 2016b), enhanced synaptic plasticity
(Fattoretti
et al., 2018) or increased neurogenesis (van Praag et al., 1999; Mustroph et al.,
2012), have been reported upon augmented physical exercise
levels. The latter is of particular importance as it has been widely
accepted that hippocampal neurogenesis, at least in rodents, plays a crucial
role in the maintenance of learning and memory and that newborn neurons
become integrated into functional neuronal networks (Deng et al., 2010), which can be
investigated using behavioral tasks depending on spatial memory (Snyder et al.,
2005) as well as contextual fear memory (Saxe et al., 2006) or recognition
memory (Jessberger
et al., 2009). The data on neurogenesis in humans are
conflicting, with recent studies reporting either a sharp drop to
undetectable levels in adults (Sorrells et al., 2018) or
abundant neurogenesis up to old age in healthy individuals with a
progressive decline in AD patients (Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019a). In
most transgenic mouse models of AD, neurogenesis is and has been associated
with other AD-related pathological hallmarks, such as extracellular amyloid
plaque deposition, increased neuroinflammation, or altered behavior (Mu and Gage,
2011; Wirths,
2017). Although a detrimental role of Aβ in neurodegeneration
and impaired neuronal progenitor proliferation is well-accepted, a
substantial influence of mutant transgenic amyloid precursor protein (APP)
overexpression or APP-derived proteolitical fragments is most likely (Wirths, 2017).
Effects on neurogenesis might depend on transgene, APP mutations, and
promoters used for transgene expression as, for example, in young J20 mice,
enhanced neurogenesis rates have been reported (Jin et al., 2004), while
unchanged neurogenesis was detected in a model with APP expression
restricted only to mature projection neurons (Yetman and Jankowsky, 2013).

The aim of this study was to investigate whether physical activity has
beneficial effects on neurogenesis and dentate gyrus (DG) structure in the
recently developed Tg4-42 mouse model of AD (Bouter et al., 2013) and
age-matched wild-type (WT) littermates. Tg4-42 mice overexpress Aβ4-42
peptides, which are among the most abundant Aβ species in human AD brain, in
the absence of APP overexpression and without AD-related mutations. These
mice develop an age- and gene dose-dependent loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons
which becomes obvious at 6 months of age in homozygous
(Tg4-42hom) animals (Antonios et al., 2015),
correlating with deficits in memory tasks such as the Morris water maze
(Hüttenrauch
et al., 2016a), but in the absence of overt extracellular
amyloid plaque pathology. It has been shown that the running wheel
represents the major stimulus present in EE paradigms, which seems
sufficient to exert neurogenic effects (Kobilo et al., 2011; Mustroph et al.,
2012). To assess whether continuous or intermittent physical
exercise is needed to exert beneficial effects on hippocampal neurogenesis,
a paradigm comprising isolation housing of WT and Tg4-42hom mice
for a period of 4 months was employed. In contrast to group housing, this
experimental set-up allows to monitor exercise levels of individual animals.
In this study, we were able to demonstrate that 6-month-old
Tg4-42hom mice have a reduced number of newborn neurons in
the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG in comparison to age-matched WT mice,
which could be rescued by both continuous as well as intermittent physical
activity. In addition, unrestricted physical activity resulted in a
significantly increased DG volume in WT mice compared to littermates which
had only access to blocked running wheels.

Material and Methods
Transgenic Mice
The generation of the Tg4-42 mouse model has been described previously
(Bouter
et al., 2013). In brief, Tg4-42 mice were generated and
maintained on a C57Bl/6J genetic background and express the human
Aβ4-42 peptide sequence. The peptide is expressed under the control of
the neuron-specific murine Thy1-promoter and has been combined with
the thyrotropin-releasing hormone signal peptide sequence to ensure
secretion through the secretory pathway. Animals were handled
according to the German guidelines for animal care and experiments
were approved by the local animal care and use committee (Landeamt für
Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit [LAVES], Lower
Saxony).

Housing Conditions
Female mice were housed in groups under standard conditions until the age
of 2 months. For the exercise paradigm, mice were assigned randomly to
individual cages (22 cm × 16 cm × 14 cm) equipped with either a free
(FW), blocked (BW), or temporarily blocked (FWI) running wheel until
the age of 6 months. While in the FW or BW condition the wheel was
either free or blocked for the entire period, the FWI condition
consisted of an alternating paradigm with 3 weeks free wheel access
followed by 2 two weeks blockage over the entire period, in order to
assess whether continuous activity is needed for beneficial effects.
Food and water were provided ad libitum in all conditions. A rotation
sensor connected to the running wheel axis transmitted running
activity with a resolution of 1/16 revolution and with a sampling rate
of 1/0.48 s to a customized recording device (Boenig und Kallenbach
oHG, Dortmund, Germany). From these raw data, the average weekly
running distance (km) was calculated and visualized using a
custom-designed Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) program
(Hüttenrauch
et al., 2016a).

Tissue Processing and Neuron Counting
Stereological analysis was performed on brain hemispheres of homozygous
Tg4-42 and age-matched WT mice. The animals were anaesthetized and
transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The brains were carefully
removed, halved following the mediosagittal line and postfixed for 2
hr at 4°C in PFA. The left brain hemispheres were then cryoprotected
by immersion in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C overnight, followed by
quickly freezing on dry-ice and storage at −80°C until further
processing. The tissues were cut on a cryostat (Leica CM1850UV) into
30 µm thick coronal sections. Every tenth section was mounted on a
glass slide and stained with Cresyl violet as previously described
(Rutten
et al., 2003). Stereological analysis of the DG (Bregma
−1.34 to −3.80) neuron number was performed as published previously.
The experimenter was blinded to genotype and treatment in all
analyses. Neurons were identified based on cytological features of
neurons in Nissl-stained sections, such as large round or ovoid
nucleoli and visible cytoplasm around the nucleus (García-Cabezas
et al., 2016). The volume was calculated by delineating
and measuring the area on all analyzed sections. From the obtained
data and taking into account the corresponding actual average section
thickness after histological preparations, as well as the intersection
interval, the total volumes were calculated by means of Cavalieri’s
principle (Gundersen and Jensen, 1987; Rutten et al., 2003; Cotel et al.,
2008; Hüttenrauch et al., 2016a).

Analysis of Neurogenesis
Using a free-floating staining protocol, a series of every 10th coronal
frozen section of 30 µm thickness was processed to quantify the number
of newborn neurons. Briefly, sections were rehydrated in PBS, and
endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersion in PBS
including 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Sections were
subsequently washed in PBS including Triton x-100, and unspecific
antibody binding was blocked by incubation in PBS including 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) and 4% low-fat dry milk powder. The primary antibody
against doublecortin (DCX, 1: 200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, RRID:AB_2088494) was incubated overnight, followed
by incubation with a secondary biotinylated antibody. DCX has been
shown to specifically reflect the level of adult neurogensis and its
modulation (Couillard-Despres et al., 2005); however, it should be
noted that this marker is expressed during neuron maturation and does
not necessarily exactly reflect the existance of mature neurons.
Staining was visualized using the ABC method using a Vectastain kit
(Vector Laboratories) and DAB as chromogen. Images were analyzed using
an Olympus BX51 microscope with a motorized stage. The overall number
of newborn neurons was counted in the SGZ of the DG using the meander
scan option of StereoInvestigator 7.0 (MBF Bioscience) to quantify all
DCX-positive cells in a given section. The resulting neuron number was
multiplied by 10 to obtain the total number of newborn neurons (Cotel et al.,
2012).

Statistical Analysis
Differences between groups were tested by unpaired t
tests or by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s
multiple comparison test when more than two groups were analyzed. All
data were given as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Significance levels were given as follows:
***p < .001; **p < .01;
*p < .05. All calculations were performed
using GraphPad Prism version 6.07 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA).

Results
Decreased Neurogenesis in the DG of Tg4-42 Mice
The number of newborn DCX-positive neurons in the SGZ of the DG was
analyzed in a group of naïve Tg4-42hom as well as
age-matched WT mice which were housed under standard conditions
(n = 5–7 per group).
Six-month-old Tg4-42hom showed a significantly reduced
number of DCX-positive cells in the DG (∼45%;
p < .01; Figure 1). In addition to the
reduced number, a qualitative assessment of DCX-positive cells in the
Tg4-42hom mice revealed in general an atrophic
appearance with much shorter and less branched dendrites compared to
WT mice (Figure
1).

age-matched WT mice (a and c), the number of DCX-positive
cells in the DG of Tg4-42hom mice (b and d) is
significantly reduced (e)
(n = 5–7 per

Next, Tg4-42hom and WT mice were housed under standard
conditions for 2 months and were subsequently randomly assigned to
individual cages equipped with a running wheel. During the following 4
months, the running wheels were free (FW) or blocked (BW) for the
entire period or free/blocked in alternating intervals (FWI; Figure 2(a)).
In the middle of the treatment period, the individual use of the
running wheels was monitored and the average distance per day was
calculated. Although no difference in the average daily distance
between the FW or FWI conditions was detected in either
Tg4-42hom or WT mice, a genotype effect became
evident, with WT-FWI mice (9.133 ± 1.886 km/day) running significantly
more than Tg4-42hom-FWI mice (3.554 ± 1.844 km/day;
p < .001). WT-FW mice (7.181 ± 3.357 km/day)
also traveled a longer distance than Tg4-42hom-FW mice
(3.939 ± 2.830 km/day) which however did not reach statistical
significance (Figure
2(b)).

different groups (b). ***p < .001.

Analysis of Neurogenesis, DG Volume, and Neuron Number
To assess a potential beneficial effect of voluntary exercise on
neurogenesis and DG integrity, unbiased design-based stereological
analyses of the DG were carried out in all genotypes upon the end of
the treatment period (Figure 3(a) to (f)). With regard to neurogenesis, no
differences could be detected in WT mice among the three groups. A
significant genotype effect was detected using two-way ANOVA,
F(1, 42) = 174.3,
p < .0001, with WT showing significantly higher
numbers of DCX-positive cells in all three treatment groups (all
p values < .001). The reduced number of
newborn neurons found in naïve mice could be confirmed in
Tg4-42hom compared to WT mice housed under BW
conditions (∼30%, p < .001; Figure 3(g)). However, in
Tg4-42hom mice, housing either in FW
(p < .001) or in FWI conditions
(p < .01) resulted in a significantly
increased number of DCX-positive cells in the DG (Figure 3(g)).

Representative images of WT (a–c) and Tg4-42hom
mice (d–f) housed in either BW (a and d), FW (b and e) or

showed a reduced number of DCX-positive cells in DG
compared to WT-BW mice, while both housing under FW and
FWI conditions resulted in a significantly increased
neurogenesis in this genotype (g). No difference in DG
volume could be detected in Tg4-42hom mice in
either housing condition, while WT mice with a free wheel
should a significantly increased DG volume compared to
their BW littermates (h). Continuous or intermittent
physical activity did not change DG neuron in WT or Tg4-42
mice (i). (n = 5–11 mice
per group); *p < .05.
**p < .01.
***p < .001. All graphs show
mean ± SD. Scale bar: (a)–(f): 100
µm. DCX = doublecortin; DG = dentate gyrus; WT = wild
type; FW = free wheel; BW = blocked wheel;
FWI = intermittent free/blocked wheel.

A comparison of WT and Tg4-42hom mice housed in BW conditions
did not reveal any differences with regard to DG volume. Although no
differences in the DG volume were detected among Tg4-42hom
mice housed under BW, FW, or FWI conditions, a significantly increased
DG volume became apparent in WT-FW compared to WT-BW mice
(p < .05). With regard to a
genotype-dependent effect, F(1, 42) = 12.69;
p = .0009, WT-FW mice showed a significantly
increased DG volume compared to Tg4-42hom mice housed under
the same conditions (p < .05; Figure 3(h)).

In view of altered DG neuron numbers upon physical activity, no major
differences could be noted in Tg4-42hom housed under BW
(604346 ± 86566), FW (627529 ± 69080), or FWI (553910 ± 79892)
conditions. A significant genotype effect was detected in WT-FWI
showing increased DG neuron numbers compared to Tg4-42hom
mice house under the same condition (p < .01).
Interestingly, WT mice allowed to continuously exercise (WT-FW;
731756 ± 43827) showed higher DG neuron number (+ ∼17%) compared to
their WT-BW (626900 ± 99978) littermates which were not able to
participate in the exercise paradigm; however, this was not
significant using two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test.
WT-FWI (689710 ± 66671) also showed higher numbers than WT-BW mice,
but this increase was also not statistically significant (Figure
3(i)).

Discussion
In the present report, we investigated the effects of voluntary exercise in the
absence of confounding other factors implicated in EE paradigms, such as
social or environmental stimuli. An analysis of DG neurogenesis in naïve
Tg4-42hom and WT mice at the age of 6 months revealed a
significantly reduced number of newborn neurons in the animals expressing
the Aβ4-42 peptides. Decreased neurogenesis is a common feature
of transgenic AD mice and has been shown in a variety of models (Mu and Gage,
2011; Wirths,
2017), such as Tg2576 (Krezymon et al., 2013), 3xTg-AD
(Rodriguez et al.,
2008), APP/PS1KI (Faure et al., 2011; Cotel et al.,
2012), and 5XFAD (Moon et al., 2014). Although most of the other models harbor
extracellular amyloid pathology in the hippocampus, no overt extracellular
plaque deposition is evident in Tg4-42 mice despite a robust neuron loss in
the CA1 pyramidal layer (Bouter et al., 2013). This is quite interesting, as it has
been shown that, for example, APP/PS1ΔEx9 mice show a reduced number of
BrdU- and DCX-positive cells at the age of 9 months in comparison to
age-matched WT control mice, while no such difference could be detected at
an age of 5 months in the absence of amyloid pathology (Taniuchi et al.,
2007). A related finding showed that 12- to 14-month-old APP
transgenic mice harboring numerous amyloid deposits in the hippocampal
formation have a reduced neurogenesis rate compared to age-matched WT mice,
while no such difference could be detected in young mice which had not yet
developed extracellular amyloid pathology (Haughey et al., 2002). Another
interesting characteristic of the Tg4-42 model is a lack of APP
overexpression. This is an important and often disregarded confounding
factor in most other transgenic AD mouse models, as it has been shown that,
for example, WT APP overexpression results in decreased hippocampal
neurogenesis (Naumann
et al., 2010), while a replacement of endogenous APP with human
APP carrying the Swedish mutant did not cause detrimental effects on
neurogenesis (Zhang
et al., 2007).

We have previously shown that housing under conditions of environmental
enrichment for 4 months resulted in a significantly increased number of
DCX-positive neurons in the DG of homozygous Tg4-42 mice, while on the
contrary, no alterations in DG neurogenesis were detected in heterozygous
Tg4-42 mice housed under EE conditions for a prolonged period of 11 months
(Hüttenrauch
et al., 2016a). The latter observation likely reflects the
general age-related drop in the rate of neurogenesis in rodents (Kuhn et al.,
1996), which became also evident in the previously observed ∼7-fold
decreased DCX-positive neuron number of 12-month-old heterozygous Tg4-42 in
comparison to homozygous 6-month-old Tg4-42 mice (Hüttenrauch et al., 2016a).

The effect of increased physical activity with regard to disease progression
and severity has been intensely studied in preclinical animal models of AD.
Several reports have demonstrated that exercise decreased extracellular
amyloid pathology (Adlard
et al., 2005; Lazarov et al., 2005; Yuede et al.,
2009), while others found stable amyloid plaque load (Cotel et al.,
2012; Marlatt
et al., 2013; Hüttenrauch et al., 2017) or even
exacerbated amyloid plaque formation (Jankowsky et al., 2003). Housing
under EE conditions led to an improvement of spatial memory deficits as well
as an amelioration of CA1 neuron loss in Tg4-42hom mice at 6
months of age without changes in the CA1 volume (Hüttenrauch et al., 2016a). In
this study, we investigated whether solely physical activity without further
social or environmental stimulation results in beneficial effects on
neurogenesis or DG organization and whether this is influenced by periods of
inactivity.

The presence of a running wheel offers the opportunity to exercise voluntarily,
and housing in single cages allows a much better assessment of the activity
level in individual animals compared to group housing. However, an analysis
of the physical activity level at weeks 7 to 8 in the middle of the
treatment period revealed that WT mice in general showed increased levels of
physical activity compared to Tg4-42 mice. This could be likely attributed
to a motor phenotype in the Tg4-42 mice, that becomes evident in tasks
addressing motor coordination, such as balance beam, or in general motor
performance and motor learning, which have been assessed using the rotarod
task (Hüttenrauch
et al., 2016a; Wagner et al., 2019). This might
suggest that reduced running distance could account for the observed
decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in Tg4-42 mice. However, a major
influence seems to be unlikely, as neurogenesis is also decreased upon
standard housing conditions and Tg4-42hom mice do not show overt
alterations in general locomotor activities (Wagner et al., 2019). It has been
further shown that physical exercise seems to be the most relevant factor
with regard to neurogenesis (Marlatt et al., 2013) and that it
represents the crucial factor in EE paradigms (Kobilo et al., 2011). Either
unrestricted or intermittent access to the running wheel increased
neurogenesis and supports previous findings from a complex EE paradigm. The
finding of an unchanged DG granule cell number in all Tg4-42hom
treatment groups does not support previous results showing an increased
number in enriched versus standard-housed mice (Hüttenrauch et al., 2016a). This
might suggest that other factors such as social stimuli or environmental
novelty play an important role in hippocampal structural changes. Indeed, it
has been recently shown that, for example, social enrichment in the absence
of further cognitive stimulation has a potent neurogenesis-stimulating
potential (Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019b) and might exert further
beneficial effects on hippocampal plasticity. The exercise paradigm utilized
in our study resembles social isolation due to housing in single cages,
which has been associated with diminished neurogenesis (Dong et al.,
2004), reduced DG, CA2/3 or total hippocampal volume (Fabricius et al.,
2010), as well as altered neuronal tree arborization in the DG
in rats (Biggio et al.,
2019). However, the fact that observed DCX-positive neuron
numbers in 6-month-old WT and Tg4-42hom mice housed either under
standard or isolation (BW) conditions were comparable argues against a major
detrimental effect and supports studies that report no prolonged impact of
social isolation on neurogenesis (Grégoire et al., 2014). The
effect of social isolation might be more relevant in WT mice, which showed
unchanged but high neurogenesis rates already in the blocked wheel
condition. Although increased neurogenesis has been reported in 6-month-old
WT mice upon enriched housing (Mirochnic et al., 2009; Cotel et al.,
2012), no differences were detected in the three different housing
conditions comprising social isolation in this study. This resembles related
findings showing that individual housing precludes the positive influence of
running on adult neurogenesis (Stranahan et al., 2006; Ibi et al., 2008)
and might become apparent in particular when neurogenesis is not compromised
per se.

In conclusion, we provide evidence that both continuous and intermitted
physical activity results in rescued neurogenic properties in the Tg4-42
transgenic mouse model of AD, thereby supporting epidemiological data on
human AD obtained in retrospective studies. The use of a mouse model
expressing only Aβ in the absence of mutant APP overexpression further
corroborates the critical involvement of this peptide in the regulation of
hippocampal neurogenesis.
