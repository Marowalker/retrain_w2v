pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disorder Type 4B (CMT4B) is a demyelinating
peripheral neuropathy caused by mutations in myotubularin-related
(MTMR) proteins 2, 13, or 5 (CMT4B1/2/3), which regulate
phosphoinositide turnover and endosomal trafficking. Although mouse
models of CMT4B2 exist, an in vitro model would make
possible pharmacological and reverse genetic experiments needed to
clarify the role of MTMR13 in myelination. We have generated such a
model using Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion (SC-DRG) explants from
Mtmr13−/− mice. Myelin sheaths
in mutant cultures contain outfoldings highly reminiscent of those
observed in the nerves of Mtmr13−/− mice
and CMT4B2 patients. Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG
explants also contain reduced Mtmr2, further supporting a role of
Mtmr13 in stabilizing Mtmr2. Elevated PI(3,5)P2 has been
implicated as a cause of myelin outfoldings in
Mtmr2−/− models. In contrast,
the role of elevated PI3P or PI(3,5)P2 in promoting
outfoldings in Mtmr13−/− models is
unclear. We found that over-expression of MTMR2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRGs moderately
reduced the prevalence of myelin outfoldings. Thus, a manipulation
predicted to lower PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 partially suppressed
the phenotype caused by Mtmr13 deficiency. We also explored the
relationship between CMT4B2-like myelin outfoldings and kinases that
produce PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 by analyzing nerve pathology in
mice lacking both Mtmr13 and one of two specific PI 3-kinases.
Intriguingly, the loss of vacuolar protein sorting 34 or PI3K-C2β in
Mtmr13−/− mice had no impact
on the prevalence of myelin outfoldings. In aggregate, our findings
suggest that the MTMR13 scaffold protein likely has critical functions
other than stabilizing MTMR2 to achieve an adequate level of PI
3-phosphatase activity.

==== Body
Introduction
Myelin is a multilamellar, spiral wrapping of specialized plasma membrane which
glial cells elaborate in order to ensheath axons (Nave and Werner, 2014; Salzer, 2015).
Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes are the specialized glia that generate
myelin in the peripheral and central nervous systems, respectively. By
localizing sodium channels to Nodes of Ranvier and by optimizing the
electrical properties of the axolemma, myelin makes possible rapid,
saltatory nerve impulse conduction (Rasband and Peles, 2015). Myelin
membranes are rich in lipids but also contain very high levels of a few key
myelin-specific proteins (Nave and Werner, 2014).
Myelinating glia also provide trophic support, notably by exchanging
metabolites with axons through specific transporters or gap junctions (Balice-Gordon et al.,
1998; Nave
and Werner, 2014; Kleopa and Sargiannidou, 2015).
Extensive signaling interactions between axons and Schwann cells govern
nerve development, myelination, the nerve’s response to injury, axonal
regeneration, and remyelination (Monk et al., 2015; Salzer, 2015).
Diseases of myelin, such as peripheral neuropathy, leukodystrophy, and
multiple sclerosis, represent a significant disease burden for which there
are few effective treatments (Pouwels et al., 2014; Brennan et al.,
2015; McMurran et al., 2016).

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of phenotypically heterogeneous
disorders which affect peripheral nerves (Jerath and Shy, 2015). With a
prevalence of about 1 in 2,500, CMT is one the most common inherited
neurological disorders (Skre, 1974). CMT-causing mutations have been identified in
about 80 genes (Baets
et al., 2014; Fridman and Reilly, 2015; Jerath and Shy,
2015). Electrophysiology and other clinical criteria can be
used to differentiate between the axonal and demyelinating forms of CMT,
which can broadly be viewed as initially affecting either the axon or the
Schwann cell, respectively (Scherer and Wrabetz, 2008). In
demyelinating CMT, secondary axonal loss is the best correlate of clinical
severity (Krajewski
et al., 2000).

Proteins mutated in demyelinating CMT regulate a number of different Schwann
cell processes and are, in some cases, myelin structural proteins. However,
nearly half the human proteins linked to demyelinating CMT are believed to
regulate membrane traffic within the endosomal-lysosomal pathway (Brennan et al.,
2015). DNM2, factor-induced gene 4
(FIG4), FGD1-related F-actin-binding protein
(FRABIN), lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis
factor-alpha factor (LITAF)/SIMPLE,
myotubularin-related 2 (MTMR2), MTMR5,
MTMR13, and SH3 domain and tetratricopeptide repeats 2
(SH3TC2) are broadly expressed in human tissues, yet
patients bearing mutations in these genes are largely spared from phenotypic
deficits other than peripheral neuropathy. These observations suggest that
myelinating Schwann cells are particularly vulnerable to disturbances in
endosomal trafficking; the reason for this vulnerability is unclear.

CMT4B is a severe subtype of demyelinating CMT which results from mutations in
myotubularin PI (phosphoinositide or phosphatidylinositol) 3-phosphatases
(MTMR2, MTMR5, and MTMR13; Figure 1) (Bolino et al., 2000; Senderek et al., 2003; Nakhro et al.,
2013). The condition is characterized by childhood onset,
severe axon loss, segmental demyelination or remyelination, and the presence
of distinctive myelin outfoldings, which are thought to arise from excessive
longitudinal growth of myelin (Previtali et al., 2007; Vaccari et al.,
2011). Myotubularin phosphatases selectively remove a phosphate
from the third position of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate and
3,5-bisphosphate (PI3P and PI(3,5)P2, respectively), two lipids
that regulate membrane traffic through the endosomal-lysosomal network by
recruiting specific effector proteins from the cytosol (Figure 1; Taylor et al., 2000; Walker et al.,
2001; Schink et al., 2016).

Figure 1. (a) Enzymatic pathway thought to be responsible for the production
of the majority of PI3P in mammalian cells and for the further
metabolism of PI3P. PI kinases and PI phosphatases are indicated
in green and red, respectively. Recessive mutations in specific
PI phosphatases (tan boxes) have been shown to cause the
indicated forms of demyelinating CMT. In mammalian cells, the
predominant function of the PI3P 5-phosphatase FIG4 is thought
to be the stimulation of PIKFYVE kinase activity, although the
enzyme is capable of dephosphorylating PI(3,5)P2. (b)
Protein domains or motifs present in MTMR2 and MTMR13 as well as
the understood functions of specific sequences. MTMR2 contains a
PI 3-phosphatase domain specific for PI3P and
PI(3,5)P2; MTMR13 contains a pseudophosphatase
domain which lacks enzymatic activity. Coiled-coil (CC)
sequences in both MTMR2 and MTMR13 are required for association
of the two proteins. PDZB = PDZ (domain)-binding;
MTMR = myotubularin-related; DENN = differentially expressed in
normal versus neoplastic; GEF = guanine nucleotide Exchange
Factor; PH = Pleckstrin homology; GRAM = glucosyltransferases,
Rab-like GTPase activators and myotubularins.

The mechanism by which the loss of MTMR2 or MTMR13 causes abnormal myelination
remains poorly understood. The selective elimination of
Mtmr2 from Schwann cells was demonstrated sufficient
to trigger the formation of CMT4B-like myelin outfoldings in mice (Bolis et al.,
2005). Given that MTMR2 and MTMR13 likely function as a complex
which dephosphorylates PI3P or PI(3,5)P2, it is predicted that
these two substrates are elevated when either member is absent; elevated
levels of PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 may disturb endosomal trafficking and
signaling (Figure
1). Indeed, it has been plausibly suggested that elevated
PI(3,5)P2 is at the basis of myelin outfolding formation in
Mtmr2-deficient Schwann cells (Vaccari et al., 2011). Unlike
MTMR2, MTMR13 is a catalytically inactive phosphatase that functions as a
scaffold protein; MTMR13 binds to MTMR2 and other endosomal proteins and
also activates Rab guanosine triphosphate (hydrolases) (GTPases; Robinson and Dixon,
2005; Jean
et al., 2012; Figure 1). In the context of myelination, the relative
importance of MTMR13’s potential function as a regulator of
phosphoinositides or as an activator of Rab GTPases has yet to be
determined.

Although mouse models of CMT4B2 (MTMR13-deficiency) have been established and
have yielded insights (Tersar et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2008), an
in vitro model of this dysmyelinating condition would
be useful for investigating the aforementioned mechanistic aspects of MTMR13
function. Here, we describe the generation and characterization of such a
model. We also provide insight into the relationships between MTMR13, MTMR2,
and the phosphoinositide substrates of the phosphatase complex.

Materials and Methods
Lentivirus Production
Third-generation lentiviruses were produced using a published method
(Tiscornia
et al., 2006). Viral packaging was accomplished by
transfecting 293FT cells (Invitogen) with a transfer vector and the
packaging plasmids pREV, pVSVG, and pMDL, which encode Rev, the
envelope protein VSVG, and Gag-Pol, respectively (Tiscornia et al.,
2006). To concentrate lentiviral particles, virus-laden
supernatants were filtered and subjected to ultracentrifugation
(83,000 × g; 2 h; 4°C; Beckman Coulter SW 41 Ti
rotor). Pelleted viral particles were resuspended in sterile
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
and stored at −80°C. Lentiviral titers were determined by flow
cytometry for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression in
transduced 293FT cells. Serial dilutions of a concentrated lentiviral
stock were prepared and used to transduce 293FT cells (in triplicate).
Forty-eight hours after transduction, cells were trypsinized and
resuspended in PBS. EGFP expression was analyzed using a Guava
easyCyte Flow Cytometer (Millipore). GuavaSoft™ (Millipore) and FlowJo
(v9.9.6) softwares were used to determine the percentage of cells
expressing EGFP. Titers for lentiviral stocks were reported as titer
units/ml (TU/ml) and used to achieve specific multiplicities of
infection (MOIs).

The lentiviral transfer vector, lentivirus phosphoglycerate kinase GFP
(LVPG) was a generous gift from Gregory Dissen. In LVPG (7,630 bp),
the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in the backbone vector
p156RRLsinPPT (Follenzi et al., 2000) is replaced with a 519-bp human
phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. LVPG contains (5′ to 3′) a
Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter-5′LTR (R-U5) sequence, a Rev
responsive element (RRE), a central polypyrimidine tract (cPPT), a PGK
promoter, an EGFP open reading frame (ORF), a woodchuck hepatitis
virus posttranscriptional regulatory element, and a self-inactivating
3′LTR (ΔU3-R-U5). The LVPG-EGFP-MTMR2 transfer vector was constructed
using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA cloning
methods; all manipulated portions of the vector were confirmed correct
by DNA sequencing. The 239 amino acid EGFP protein sequence encoded by
LVPG is identical to that encoded by EGFP-C1 (GenBank Accession
U55763.1). The protein linker sequence between EGFP and MTMR2 in
LVPG-EGFP-MTMR2 is SGLRS. The human MTMR2 protein encoded by
LVPG-EGFP-MTMR2 is identical to the reference sequence (GenBank
Accession NP_057240.3) except for the presence of a previously
reported common MTMR2 polymorphism (Lys3 to Thr; Bolino et al.,
2001; Houlden et al., 2001). The ORF for the EGFP-MTMR2 fusion
protein resides between the XbaI (5′) and
SalI (3′) restriction endonuclease sites of
LVPG.

Myelinating Explant Cultures From Dorsal Root Ganglia
Wild-type (C57BL/6) or Mtmr13−/− female mice
(N8 generation on C57BL/6) were bred to males of their same genotype,
respectively. At 13.5 days of gestation, pregnant females were killed,
and embryos were removed and placed in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered
saline (DPBS; Life Technologies) on ice. Each litter of embryos was
held in DPBS, while the individual embryos were sequentially
dissected. To isolate E13.5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG), embryos were
individually removed from DPBS and placed for gross dissection in a
6-cm glass Petri dish containing 2 ml of 37°C Leibovitz's L-15 medium
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
0.5% penicillin-streptomycin (P-S; 50 units/ml of penicillin and
50 µg/ml of streptomycin). The trunk of the embryo was isolated and
transferred to a new 60-mm glass Petri dish (lined with Sylgard-184
silicone) containing 2 ml of 37°C L-15 medium (10% FBS, 0.5% P-S), for
spinal cord isolation. The spinal cord (with attached DRG) was
dissected from the vertebral column using fine forceps and transferred
to a new Sylgard-184-lined glass Petri dish (60 mm) containing 2 ml of
37°C L-15 medium (10% FBS, 0.5% P-S). Individual DRGs were plucked off
with Dumont #5 forceps. DRGs were then removed from the dissection
dish and transferred, using a 200-μl micropipette, to a 14-ml conical
tube containing 7 ml of L-15 medium (10% FBS. 0.5% P-S). This conical
tube was held in a 37°C water bath in between dissections of embryos.
All of the DRGs dissected from the embryos of a given pregnant female
were pooled.

All subsequent DRG culture procedures were carried out in a biological
safety cabinet; all media were prewarmed to 37°C. When the dissections
were complete, the volume was adjusted to 14 ml by adding 7 ml of L-15
medium (10% FBS, 0.5% P-S). DRGs were allowed to settle in the conical
tube for 10 to 20 min in a 37°C water bath. All but ∼0.5 ml of the
medium was carefully removed and 14 ml of L-15 medium lacking serum
and P-S was added back to the tube. DRGs were again allowed to settle
for 10 min in a 37°C water bath. All but ∼0.5 ml of the medium was
carefully removed and 5 ml of Trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA; 0.25%; Invitrogen) was added. The DRGs were then incubated in a
37°C water bath for 45 min. Five milliliters of L-15 medium (10% FBS,
0.5% P-S) was added, and the DRGs were pelleted by centrifugation for
30 s at 170 × g. The pelleted DRGs were washed once
in 10 ml of 37°C L-15 medium (10% FBS, 0.5% P-S) and again centrifuged
at 170 × g for 10 min. The medium was removed and
replaced with 2 ml of 37°C M1 medium (Modified Eagles Medium [MEM];
Life Technologies; 5.2 g/L D-glucose; 10% FBS) containing mouse nerve
growth factor (NGF 2.5S Native Mouse Protein; Life Technologies) at 50
or 10 ng/ml.

DRGs were triturated by aggressively pipetting up and down 10 times using
a 200-μL micropipette. Triturated isolates were centrifuged for 5 min
at 170 × g and subsequently resuspended in 1 ml of
M1-NGF medium. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Dissociated
DRGs were plated at the density of 130,000 total cells per well by
placing a 160-μl drop of the cell suspension in the center of a 25-mm
circular coverslip that had been coated with a solution of rat tail
collagen (0.5 mg/ml). Using a fine pipette tip on a 20-μL
micropipette, three bubbles were introduced at the center of the drop
of suspended cells (to encourage the cells to adhere in the center of
the coverslip). Cultures were incubated overnight at 37°C in 5%
CO2.

The day on which embryos were dissected was designated culture Day 0. On
culture Day 1, 1 ml of M1-NGF medium was added to each well of explant
culture. On Days 3, 5, and 7, the medium was replaced with a fresh 2
ml of M1-NGF medium. On Day 8, the medium was changed to 2 ml of C
medium (MEM; Life Technologies, 10% FBS, 29 mM D-glucose, and 3.76 mM
L-glutamine), which contained 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (AA) to promote
myelination by endogenous Schwann cells, and 50 or 10 ng/ml NGF. On
Days 11, 14, 17, and 20, the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh C
medium (with AA and NGF). On Day 21, cultures were either fixed for
immunofluorescence or lysed for immunoblotting.

When Schwann cell-dorsal root ganglion (SC-DRG) cultures were infected
with lentiviruses, the culture protocol was identical to that
described earlier except as follows: On Day 5, the fresh M1-NGF medium
contained the appropriate amount of lentiviral particles needed to
achieve the desired MOI. On Day 6, the virus-containing medium was
removed, the explant was washed twice with C medium containing NGF,
and 2 ml of C medium with NGF was added. On Day 7, no action was
taken. We found that an MOI of 15 to 20 was the lowest amount of virus
which routinely yielded Schwann cell transduction rates of 90% or
greater. To assess the rate of lentiviral transduction, all of the
Schwann cells in four or five 100 μm2 60× Z-stack images
were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and scored
as positive or negative for EGFP fluorescence in the associated
Schwann cell body.

Immunofluorescence
After 21 days in culture, DRG explants were washed once with PBS and
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room
temperature (RT) on a rocking platform. Fixed cultures were washed
three times with PBS and subsequently permeabilized in ice-cold
methanol for 5 min (on ice). After washing once with PBS, cultures
were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 10% normal goat serum (NGS).
Fixed cells were covered with a solution of PBS with 0.1% Tween-20
(PBST), which contained 2% NGS and appropriately diluted primary
antibodies; this mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C on a rocking
platform. Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were a rat
anti-myelin basic protein (MBP) monoclonal antibody (mAb; Millipore
Cat# MAB386 RRID:AB_94975), and a chicken anti-neurofilament H
polyclonal antibody (pAb; IgY fraction; Abcam Cat# ab4680 RRID:AB_304560). After an overnight incubation at
4°C, cultures were washed 3 times for 10 min with PBST. Fluorescent
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were diluted to 3 µg/ml
in PBST containing 2% NGS and applied to cultures. Cultures were then
incubated for 1 h at RT on a rocking platform. After incubation with
secondary antibodies, cultures were washed thrice for 10 min with
PBST. Cell nuclei were labeled with 0.36 μM DAPI, via a 1-min RT
incubation. Cultures (on coverslips) were next washed twice for 5 min
with PBST, rinsed once in distilled deionized (dd) water, and mounted
on ColorFrost™ Plus microscope slides (ThermoFisher) using Elvanol as
a mounting medium. When SC-DRG cultures were infected with
lentiviruses expressing EGFP or EGFP-MTMR2, secondary antibodies used
were Cy3-goat-anti-rat (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Cat# 112-165-143
RRID:AB_2338250) and
AlexaFluor-647-goat-anti-chicken IgY (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs Cat#
103-605-155 RRID:AB_2337392).

Image Acquisition and Analysis
Images were acquired using a Nikon or Yokogawa CSU-W1 spinning disk
microscope, 60× (Nikon Plan Apo VC OFN 25, 1.4, oil) or 40× (Nikon
Plan Fluor, 40×, 1.3, oil) objectives, and NIS-Elements AR imaging
software (Nikon, V. 4.20.01 build 982). Thirty-six 20-μm Z-stacks
(sampled every 1 μm) were randomly selected by programing the
microscope to acquire a 6 by 6 grid of images. The 6 by 6 grid was
positioned over the explant such that one corner of the grid was set
just inside the outer edge of the myelinated portion of the explant.
The midpoint of each Z-stack was set by manual focusing. Z-stack
images were separated by 1 mm across the grid. With the 60× objective,
the field of view for each image was 277.33 × 234.00 μm. Thus, each
coverslip was randomly sampled across a total area of
2.33 mm2. With the 40× objective, the field of view
for each image was 416 × 351 μm. Thus, each coverslip was randomly
sampled across a total area of 5.26 mm2. Using the Fiji
image processing package for ImageJ (v2.0.0-rc-46/1.50 g), Z-stack
images were projected into a single image view using the standard
deviation of each pixel. Such Z-stacks were used for myelin analysis.
The total number of complete myelin segments in each projection was
counted, and this number was used to determine the density of
myelinated segments (per mm2) within a given explant. A
myelinated segment was included in the analysis only if the full
myelin internode was clearly present in the image. The length of
myelin segments was measured using Fiji.

To determine the percentage of myelin segments that contained
outfoldings, we analyzed only segments for which the full myelin
internode was clearly present in the image. We classified a myelin
irregularity as an outfolding if the structure met one or more the
following criteria: (a) A single, bubble-like structure having a
diameter of at least half than that of the myelin sheath to which it
is attached, (b) a multilobed, bubble-like structure in which the
individual lobes have a diameter of at least half than that of the
myelin sheath to which they are attached, (c) a “lollipop”-like
structure in which one or two MBP-positive myelin bulbs are connected
to the associated myelin sheath by a thin “stalk” (Figure 3(e’)),
and (d) a cluster of small myelin bubbles (Figure 3(h)). Using these
criteria and the explant sampling imaging method described earlier, we
determined the fraction of myelinated segments which contained one or
more myelin outfoldings. All immunofluorescence-based quantifications
of myelin density or the prevalence of myelin outfoldings were carried
out with the investigator blinded to the genotype or the treatment
being tested.

Electron Microscopic Analysis
Myelinating DRG explant cultures were established and maintained as
described earlier. On Day 15 or 21, cultures were fixed in freshly
prepared 2% PFA and 1.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) overnight at
4°C. Cultures were rinsed with PBS, and a cell scraper was used to
dislodge the culture from the coverslip and transfer it to a 1.5-ml
tube containing 1 ml of 6% BSA in PBS (pH 7.4). After an overnight
incubation at 4°C, cultures were pelleted via centrifugation at
94 × g for 5 min at RT. All but 500 μl of the
BSA–PBS solution was removed, and 500 μl of electron microscopy (EM)
fixative (1.5% glutaraldehyde, 1.5% PFA, 0.05 M sucrose, 0.25%
CaCl2, and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate; pH 7.4) was added
to the tube. Samples were incubated at 4°C for at least 4 h to allow
the BSA–PBS fixative solution to polymerize. The pelleted cultures,
now surrounded in a gel, were removed, divided into smaller pieces for
further processing, rinsed with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (with
0.05 M sucrose and 0.25% CaCl2; pH 7.4), and further fixed
in EM fixative. The samples were then loaded into individual wells of
a Ted Pella PELCO Prep-Eze 12- or 6-well specimen holder (containing
0.1 M cacodylate buffer) for microwave-assisted postfixation,
dehydration, and embedding. The specimen holder was placed in a 50-mm
Petri dish and loaded into the vacuum chamber of a PELCO Biowave Pro
36500 microwave (Ted Pella). Briefly, samples were washed in 0.1 M
sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), postfixed in 2% buffered OsO4,
stained en bloc with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in
graded ethanol solutions (50%–100%), and finally embedded in epoxy
resin. Ultrathin (60–90 nm) sections were cut, placed on 200 mesh
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grids and contrasted further
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined using an
FEI Tecnai 12 transmission EM operating at 80 kV. Digital images were
acquired using a 16-megapixel Advanced Microscopy Techniques XR16M
camera. For EM on sciatic nerves, mice were perfused with EM fixative
(above); nerves were dissected and processed similarly as described
earlier. For light microscopic analysis of sciatic nerves, mice were
perfused with EM fixative (above); nerves were dissected and processed
similarly as described earlier, except that 500-nm cross-sections were
stained with toluidine blue prior to microscopy.

Immunoblotting
To prepare protein extracts, myelinating SC-DRG explants (grown on 25-mm
coverslips in six well dishes) were washed once with 2 ml of PBS at RT
and placed on ice. The explant material was collected in 200 μL of
ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton
X-100, 100 mM NaF, 1 mM Na2VO4, and 2 mM EDTA)
in which one cOmplete™ mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
tablet (Roche) was dissolved for every 10 ml of buffer and
subsequently homogenized. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation
(15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C), and protein
concentrations were determined using Bradford assays. Clarified
extracts were prepared for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by adding NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and 1 mM DTT, and heating the sample. The protein
(20–25 μg) was resolved in each lane of a NuPAGE 4% to 12% Bis-Tris
gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane. A total protein stain (MemCode, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
was used to confirm uniform electroblotting transfer of proteins to
membranes. Immunoblotting was accomplished by standard methods;
immunoblots were quantitated using peroxidase-activated
chemiluminescence on a G:BOX Chemi imaging system with GeneSys
software (Syngene). After normalization for differences in β-tubulin
content, data were normalized such that the mean value for the
wild-type sample was either 100 or 1. Primary antibodies used for
immunoblotting were mouse-anti-GFP (mAb; UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab
Facility Cat# N86/8 RRID:AB_2313651) mouse-anti-ß-tubulin (mAb; clone
E7; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa; DSHB
Cat# E7 also AB_2315513 RRID:AB_528499). The anti-MTMR2 (119-AN) and
anti-MTMR13 (116-AN) rabbit antibodies have been described elsewhere
(Robinson and Dixon, 2005; Ng et al., 2013).

Statistics
Graphpad Prism software was used for statistical analyses. Unless
otherwise stated in the figure legend, an unpaired t
test was used to evaluate significance (p ≤ .05).
Welch’s correction was applied to t tests when
unequal variance was observed. For SC-DRG explant experiments,
n = 3 to 7 explants or coverslips derived from
2 to 4 independent (pregnant) female mice for each genotype or
treatment. Sample sizes for experiments were based on pilot data,
expected or minimum effect size, expected or observed variance, and
power analyses.

RNA Expression Analysis
The BioGPS gene annotation portal (www.biogps.org)
was used to assess whether the human mRNAs for the endosomal-lysosomal
trafficking-linked demyelinating CMT proteins dynamin 2
(DNM2), FIG4, FRABIN,
LITAF/small integral membrane protein of the lysosome/late
endosome (SIMPLE), MTMR2, MTMR5,
MTMR13, and SH3TC2 show broad or
restricted expression in human tissues.

Mice
All work with animals was approved by and conformed to the standards of
the Oregon Health and Science University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Charles River. Vps34
Schwann cell knockout (Vps34SCKO) and
Mtmr13−/− mice have been described
previously (Robinson et al., 2008; Ng et al., 2013; Logan et al.,
2017).

Generation of Pik3c2β−/− and
Mtmr13−/−Pik3c2β−/− mice
Pik3c2β+/flmice (Harada et al., 2005)
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Strain:
B6.129-Pik3c2btm1Pkha/J). To generate a null
allele of PI3K-C2β, Pik3c2β+/floxmice were crossed with CMV-Cre mice
(Jackson Laboratory strain B6.C-Tg[CMV-cre]1Cgn/J). The
resulting CMV-Cre+; Pik3c2β+/floxprogeny were crossed with C57BL/6 mice to accomplish
germ line deletion of floxed Pik3c2β exons 3–5.
Pik3c2β+/Δprogeny were intercrossed to generate
Pik3c2βΔ/Δmice, which were subsequently crossed with
Mtmr13−/− mice (N8 on
C57BL/6) to yield Pik3C2β+/Δ
Mtmr13+/− double heterozygotes,
which were then intercrossed to generate
Pik3c2βΔ/Δ
Mtmr13−/− mice. A three-primer PCR
using oligonucleotides EJS-003 (GGCACACACTAACCACAGCACC), EJS-004
(TCGATGCACGTCTCTCCGC), and EJS-005 (ACACTGGGGTGAGCTGAGCTAGG) was
used to genotype mice for Pik3c2β. Using these
primers, the wild-type, floxed, and deleted
(Δ) alleles of Pik3c2β
yield PCR products of 568, 618, and 404 bp, respectively.

Results
Efficient In Vitro Myelination by Schwann Cells
Lacking Mtmr13
Mtmr13−/− mice have been shown to be a useful
model of CMT4B2; these animals recapitulate many key characteristics
of the human disease. First, Mtmr13−/−
mice display the distinctive myelin outfoldings that are a hallmark of
CMT4B (Tersar
et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2008).
These animals also show reduced nerve conduction velocity, consistent
with a demyelinating form of peripheral neuropathy (Tersar et al.,
2007; Robinson et al., 2008). Finally, aged
Mtmr13−/− mice show marked
axonal loss, hypomyelination, and evidence of demyelination or
remyelination (Ng
et al., 2013), all characteristics of CMT4B2 (Previtali et al.,
2007). In summary, Mtmr13−/−
mice effectively model both the initial dysmyelination and subsequent
segmental demyelination of CMT4B2, as well as the advanced axonal
pathology of the human condition. We sought to determine if
Mtmr13−/− mice could be used
to generate an in vitro model of CMT4B2
dysmyelination. Such a model would make feasible the reverse genetic
and pharmacological experiments that are needed to clarify the
function of the enigmatic MTMR13 pseudophosphatase (reviewed in Raess et al.,
2017).

Elegant experimental methods for studying in vitro
myelination by rodent Schwann cells were developed in the late 1980s
(Eldridge
et al., 1987) and have since been used to study a number
of aspects of myelination and Schwann cell–axon interactions (Maurel et al.,
2007; Bolis et al., 2009; Lewallen et al., 2011).
Using adaptations of such methods, we established dissociated SC-DRG
explant cultures from wild-type and
Mtmr13−/− mice at embryonic (E) Day
13.5. In culture, dissociated DRG sensory neurons elaborate new axons,
which are subsequently myelinated by Schwann cell precursors present
in the explanted material (Eldridge et al., 1987).
Immunofluorescence microscopy of neurofilament H and MBP was used to
visualize axons and compact myelin, respectively, in SC-DRG explants
after 21 days in culture. We also established a semiautomated
microscopy imaging method that allowed for an unbiased sampling of a
large portion of the explant area, which was typically about 15 mm in
diameter (Figure 2(a)
to (c)). This method was used to quantitate myelin
segments, thereby providing an assessment of the efficiency of
myelination. As segmental demyelination is a feature of CMT4B2, we
assessed the capacity of Mtmr13−/− Schwann
cells for myelination in vitro. The extent of
myelination was similar in wild-type and
Mtmr13−/− explant cultures (Fig. 2A-D).
Robust myelination in Mtmr13−/− explant
cultures is consistent with the observation that myelin is of normal
thickness in young adult Mtmr13−/− mice
(Tersar
et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2008).

semiautomated image collection method. Dissociated DRG
explant cultures were generated from wild-type and
Mtmr13−/− embryos at
E13.5 and cultured for 21 days under conditions that
promote myelination. Myelin and axons were visualized via
immunofluorescence with antibodies to myelin basic protein
(MBP; magenta) and neurofilament heavy
chain (NFH; green), respectively. (a and

test; mean ± SD; n = 7
and 6 independent explants for wild type and

(the median value was 806 myelin segments counted per
explant/coverslip). (e and f) An example of a

An In Vitro Model of CMT4B2 Dysmyelination
A hallmark of CMT4B is the presence of myelin outfoldings (Ohnishi et al.,
1989; Quattrone et al., 1996; Othmane et al., 1999; Previtali et al.,
2007). When viewed in transverse sections, such
structures appear as redundant loops of myelin flanking the primary
myelin sheath (Previtali et al., 2007). In mutant mouse nerves,
CMT4B-like myelin outfoldings appear to preferentially arise from
regions of noncompact myelin (paranodes and Schmidt-Lanterman
incisures; Bolino
et al., 2004; Tersar et al., 2007; Robinson et al.,
2008); these structures are thought to result from
excessive longitudinal growth of myelin membranes (Vaccari et al.,
2011). Schwann cell-specific deletion of
Mtmr2 has been shown to be sufficient to
provoke myelin outfoldings in mice; loss of Mtmr2 in motor neurons
does not trigger outfoldings (Bolis et al., 2005). The
underlying etiology of CMT4B-type myelin outfoldings is unclear. It
has been suggested that formation may involve abnormal
endosomal-lysosomal myelin membrane trafficking in regions of
noncompact myelin, a change that may lead to increased incorporation
of membrane-bearing vesicles into myelin sheets (Bolis et al., 2009).

The morphology of nonmyelinating, Remak bundle Schwann cells is normal in
Mtmr13−/− mice (Robinson et al.,
2008), suggesting that Mtmr13 may only be essential when
Schwann cells generate myelin. The compaction and the periodicity of
peripheral myelin in Mtmr13−/− mice has
also been demonstrated to be normal (Robinson et al., 2008).
Intriguingly, MTMR13 is expressed in many other cells types throughout
the human body, including those of the central nervous system. Despite
this, CMT4B2 patients (and Mtmr13−/− mice)
appear to be spared from phenotypic deficiencies other than
demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. The sole apparent exception to
this observation is that most CMT4B2 patients are also diagnosed with
early-onset glaucoma (Kiwaki et al., 2000; Azzedine et al.,
2003; Hirano et al., 2004). In aggregate, the data suggest
that the absence of MTMR13 triggers a defect in myelin sheet
structural homeostasis. This defect is likely present during initial
postnatal myelination in mice and results in the steady accumulation
and growth of myelin outfoldings as mice mature and age (Ng et al.,
2013). Eventually, ill-defined abnormalities in
MTMR13-deficient Schwann cells lead to segmental demyelination (Kiwaki et al.,
2000; Azzedine et al., 2003; Senderek et al., 2003;
Hirano
et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2013).

Previous work has demonstrated that myelin outfoldings are present in the
nerves of Mtmr13−/− mice as early as P3,
indicating that these abnormal structures form during initial
myelination (Ng
et al., 2013). To assess whether similar myelin
structures form in vitro, we examined myelin segments
in wild-type and Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants
using immunofluorescence for MBP. We found that myelin segments in
Mtmr13−/− explants contained
MBP-positive protuberances reminiscent of the outfoldings observed in
the nerves of Mtmr13−/− mice and CMT4B2
patients (Figure
3(b’), (c) to (F’); Othmane et al., 1999; Kiwaki et al.,
2000; Azzedine et al., 2003; Senderek et al., 2003;
Previtali
et al., 2007; Tersar et al., 2007; Robinson et al.,
2008).

outfoldings (the median value was 806 myelin segments
evaluated per explant/coverslip).
MTMR = myotubularin-related.

Myelin outfoldings typically had a nodular appearance, often first
projecting away from the myelin sheath, then turning and extending
along the longitudinal axis of the internode (Figure 3(b’) to (D’)). Many
myelin outfoldings manifested as elaborate groups of small myelin
“bubbles,” highly reminiscent of what has been observed in
longitudinally sectioned axons in nerve biopsies from CMT4B patients
(Ohnishi
et al., 1989; Gabreels-Festen et al.,
1990; Quattrone et al., 1996; Houlden et al., 2001; Previtali et al.,
2007). Broadly speaking, the outfoldings observed by
light microscopy in mutant SC-DRG explants project away from the
myelin sheath more significantly than the corresponding structures
observed in intact Mtmr13−/− mouse nerves
(Tersar
et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2008;
Figure
3(e’)). This finding may be a consequence of the crowded
environment of the intact nerve, relative to that of the in
vitro explant culture. Myelin outfoldings in
Mtmr13−/− explants were
observed throughout the internode, including directly adjacent to the
Schwann cell nucleus and at the ends of myelinated segments (nodes or
heminodes; Figure
3(f’) and (h)).

The explant sampling imaging method described earlier was used to assess
the prevalence of myelin outfoldings in cultures. We found that myelin
outfoldings occurred at a significantly higher rate in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants than
in wild-type explants (Figure 3(k)). Although myelin
abnormalities that fit our strict criteria for classification as
outfoldings were present in wild-type cultures, these were
significantly smaller and less elaborate than those observed in mutant
cultures (see Materials and Methods section).

We also used EM to examine the ultrastructure of myelin formed in
vitro by mutant Schwann cells. Myelin outfoldings in
Mtmr13−/− explants were
similar in appearance to those found in intact sciatic nerves from
mutant mice (Figure
4(a) to (d)). Redundant loops of myelin, although
appearing unconnected to the primary myelin sheath when viewed in EM
cross sections, are instead likely to be contiguous with the primary
myelin sheath, particularly when considered in parallel with MBP
immunofluorescence of SC-DRG cultures (Figure 3). The compaction of
myelin in Mtmr13−/− explants appeared
similar to that in wild-type explants (Figure 4(e) and (f)).

Reduced Mtmr2 Protein in the Absence of Mtmr13 In
Vitro
To further explore how SC-DRG cultures from
Mtmr13−/− mice may recapitulate
aspects of the in vivo model, we assessed the status
of an important binding partner, Mtmr2. MTMR phosphatases comprise a
large subgroup of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily,
which consists of about 105 distinct proteins in humans (Alonso et al.,
2004; Tonks, 2013). With 14 MTMR phosphatases identified in
the human genome, it is intriguing that such a significant fraction of
the PTP superfamily appears dedicated to the dephosphorylation of PI3P
and PI(3,5)P2. Moreover, the fact that nearly half of the
human MTMR phosphatases are catalytically inactive indicates important
nonenzymatic roles for some members of this protein family. Partially
explaining this latter observation, homo- and hetero-oligomerization
among MTMR proteins appears to be an important mode by which this
family of phosphatases and pseudophosphatases is regulated (reviewed
in Raess et al.,
2017). Particularly intriguing is the case of MTMR2,
MTMR13, and MTMR5, as the homozygous loss of any one of these three
proteins triggers CMT4B, with the condition’s distinctive myelin
outfoldings (Bolino
et al., 2000; Azzedine et al., 2003; Senderek et al.,
2003; Nakhro et al., 2013; Figure 1). MTMR2 has been
demonstrated to associate with both MTMR13 and MTMR5, in a manner that
requires coiled-coil interaction motifs located in each of the
proteins (Kim
et al., 2003; Robinson and Dixon, 2005;
Berger
et al., 2006). The association of MTMR2 and MTMR13 is
likely to be relevant to CMT4B, as the loss of Mtmr13 significantly
reduces the abundance of Mtmr2 in mouse sciatic nerves, indicating a
role of Mtmr13 in stabilizing its catalytically active binding partner
(Ng et al.,
2013).

Consistent with observations in intact mouse nerves, we found that Mtmr2
protein levels were reduced by 35% in myelinating
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG cultures
(Figure
5). A 35% decrease in Mtmr2 levels may be consequential,
particularly if one considers that myelinating Schwann cells are a
relatively minor component of the total cellular material in a
cultured DRG explant, which contains many nonmyelinating Schwann
cells, as well as axons, neuronal soma, and fibroblasts. If the
stabilization of Mtmr2 by Mtmr13 only occurs in Schwann cells (or
perhaps only in myelinating Schwann cells), the dependence of Mtmr2 on
Mtmr13 may be more significant than our quantitation indicates. It has
been demonstrated that Mtmr13 is not required for Mtmr2 stabilization
in mouse brain tissue or fibroblasts, suggesting that dependence on
Mtmr13 is unique to the CMT4B2-relevant sciatic nerve (Ng et al.,
2013). Thus, in addition to showing the hallmark myelin
abnormality of CMT4B2, explant cultures from
Mtmr13−/− mice also
recapitulate an important biochemical feature observed in mouse
nerves, namely, reduced Mtmr2 abundance.

Relationship Between Mtmr13 and Mtmr2 in the Context of
Myelination
With an in vitro model of CMT4B2 dysmyelination
available, we considered whether the outfolding phenotype might be
modified by manipulating Mtmr2. As mentioned earlier, Mtmr13 has been
shown to bind to and stabilize Mtmr2 (Ng et al., 2013). MTMR13
has also been shown to be largely membrane associated, with the
protein’s pseudophosphatase domain being sufficient for this
localization (Robinson and Dixon, 2005; Figure 1). In myelinating
Schwann cells, endogenous Mtmr13 has been demonstrated to be present
on endomembrane structures (Ng et al., 2013), which may
be endosomes, given that PI3P, a substrate of the MTMR2-MTMR13
complex, is enriched on such membranes. Consistently, investigations
of the Drosophila orthologs of Mtmr2 and Mtmr13 have
indicated that the Mtmr13-like pseudophosphatase functions to recruit
the active Mtmr2-like PI 3-phosphatase to specific cortical and
vesicular membranes (Jean et al., 2012). With
these findings in mind, Mtmr2 might be viewed as biochemically
downstream of the catalytically inactive Mtmr13. Thus, if myelin
outfoldings in Mtmr13−/− Schwann cells are
triggered by elevated PI3P or PI(3,5)P2, reducing the
levels of these phosphoinositides might suppress the formation of
these abnormal membrane structures. To test this hypothesis, we
generated a lentivirus that expresses EGFP-MTMR2 and used this tool to
introduce the protein into Mtmr13−/−
SC-DRG explant cultures.

When introduced into SC-DRG explants, the EGFP-MTMR2 protein was
localized to the Schwann cell cytoplasm and was excluded from the
nucleus (Figure
6(e)), consistent with earlier reports on the
localization of endogenous Mtmr2 in Schwann cells (Previtali et al.,
2003; Ng et al., 2013). In contrast, a lentivirus-expressed
EGFP control protein was present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm
of Schwann cells (Figure 6(d)). Virally expressed EGFP and EGFP-MTMR2 were
also present in the axons, neuronal soma, and fibroblasts of explant
cultures. When explants were virally transduced using the same MOI,
EGFP invariably accumulated to much higher levels than did EGFP-MTMR2
(Figure 6(b)
and (C)), consistent with the very long half-life of the
GFP protein in mammalian cells (∼26 h; Corish and Tyler-Smith,
1999). Using an MOI at which greater than 90% of all
Schwann cells were infected, we found that EGFP-MTMR2 was expressed at
a level about 3 times that of the endogenous Mtmr2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG (Figure 6(f) and
(g) and Supplemental Figure S1), and about twice the
level of endogenous Mtmr2 in wild-type SC-DRG explants (Figure 6(f)).
Thus, we established conditions whereby MTMR2 protein expression is
restored to a level moderately higher than that of the wild type in
nearly all the cells present in a given explant culture.

levels similar to those of endogenous Mtmr2. (a–c)
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG
explants were infected with LV-encoding EGFP or
EGFP-MTMR2, or left uninfected (a). Infection was on Day 5
and carried out at an MOI of 20. More than 90% of the
Schwann cells in an explant were infected with EGFP or
EGFP-MTMR2 under these conditions. At 21 days, explants
were analyzed for EGFP fluorescence
(green); nuclei were stained with
DAPI (blue). Despite similar viral
transduction rates, EGFP fluorescence was significantly
brighter than EGFP-MTMR2. (d and e) Higher magnification

levels of the endogenous Mtmr2 protein and the EGFP-MTMR2
protein, respectively. Relative Mtmr2/MTMR2 protein:

Lentiviral expression of EGFP-MTMR2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants reduced
the prevalence of myelin outfoldings by about 25% (Figure 7(a) to
(e)), suggesting that, by reducing the levels of PI3P
and/or PI(3,5)P2, the exogenous MTMR2 protein prevented the
formation of myelin outfoldings to a moderate degree. We also noted
that MTMR2 overexpression in Mtmr13−/−
SC-DRGs suppressed myelination globally (Figure 7(f) to (i)). Both the
number of myelin segments per unit area and the average length of
segments were significantly decreased (Figure 7(j) and (k)). Thus,
in the context of relatively modest overexpression, exogenous MTMR2
reduced the efficiency of myelination, presumably by lowering the
levels of the MTMR2 lipid substrates PI3P and
PI(3,5)P2.

As described earlier, the overexpression of EGFP-MTMR2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants
caused only a moderate reduction in the prevalence of myelin
outfoldings. Thus, much of the Mtmr13−/−
phenotype persists even when Mtmr2 is brought back to at least
wild-type levels. This finding suggests that the most critical
function of MTMR13 may not be the stabilization of MTMR2 (and
concomitant enhancement of PI 3-phosphatase activity). We sought to
further probe the relationship between PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 and
the myelin abnormalities associated with the loss of MTMR13. Given
that the pathology associated with Mtmr13 loss appears to be
manifested only during myelination (Tersar et al., 2007; Robinson et al.,
2008; Ng et al., 2013), and that myelinating Schwann cells
represent a relatively minor component of the total cellular material
in a cultured DRG explant, we chose to take an in
vivo genetic approach to manipulating phosphoinositide
levels.

Elimination of PI 3-Kinase Isoforms That Generate PI3P Does Not Alter
Myelin Abnormalities Associated With Loss of the Mtmr13
Pseudophosphatase
It remains unclear how the balance of PI 3-kinase and 3-phosphatase
activities maintains appropriate levels of PI3P, particularly in
specialized mammalian cell types (Figure 1(a); Raiborg et al.,
2013). It is predicted that CMT4B-causing,
loss-of-function mutations in MTMR13 or
MTMR2 may lead to pathogenic elevation of PI3P
and PI(3,5)P2 in Schwann cells (Cao et al., 2008; Figure 1(a)).
Indeed, it has been demonstrated that genetic and pharmacological
manipulations which lower PI(3,5)P2 levels reduce the
prevalence myelin outfoldings in Mtmr2−/−
nerves and explant cultures (Vaccari et al., 2011). We
therefore investigated whether genetic mutations predicted to lower
PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 levels in
Mtmr13−/− Schwann cells would reduce
the prevalence myelin outfoldings in an in vivo model
of CMT4B2, presumably by normalizing endosomal trafficking. To do so,
we generated Mtmr13−/−
Vps34SCKO mice, in which Vps34 is
selectively deleted in Schwann cells, and compared the nerves of these
animals to those of Mtmr13−/− mice.
Schwann cell-specific deletion of Vps34 had no significant impact on
the prevalence of myelin outfoldings in
Mtmr13−/− sciatic nerves (Figure 8(a) and
(b)). This finding suggests that, in Schwann cells, Vps34
is not responsible for generating a pool of PI3P that is critically
dephosphorylated by the Mtmr2-Mtmr13 phosphatase complex.

the significance. (c) A higher magnification EM image of

Schwann cell-specific deletion of Vps34 leads to a
significant arrest of myelination beginning at postnatal Day 7 (P7),
as well as abnormalities in endosomal-lysosomal trafficking (Figure 8(a) and
(c); Logan et al., 2017). Those axons which are myelinated in
Vps34SCKOmouse nerves are invariably hypomyelinated.
Vps34SCKO nerves also show
abnormal regulation of the erythroblastosis oncogene B (ErbB2)/3
receptor tyrosine kinases, critical components of the promyelinating
signaling program in Schwann cells (Logan et al., 2017).
ErbB2/3 are known to transit through early endosomes (Sorkin and Goh,
2009), consistent with their altered regulation in the
absence of Schwann cell Vps34 (Logan et al., 2017).

Vps34 has been shown to be responsible for producing about 65% of the
total PI3P present in mammalian cells (Devereaux et al., 2013;
Ikonomov
et al., 2015; Figure 1(a)). Deletion of
Vps34 also lowers PI(3,5)P2 levels
by about 65%, as this lipid is thought to be largely derived from PI3P
(Ikonomov
et al., 2015; Figure 1(a)). Thus, in
Mtmr13−/− Vps34SCKO
Schwann cells, a likely substantial suppression of PI3P and
PI(3,5)P2 levels (caused by loss of Vps34) triggers
endosomal trafficking defects that prevent or inhibit myelination
after P7 (Figure
8(a)). Under these conditions, the myelin outfoldings
triggered by Mtmr13-deficiency form unabated. This in
vivo finding strongly suggests that elevated PI3P or
PI(3,5)P2 levels are not a significant trigger of
myelin outfoldings in Mtmr13−/− Schwann
cells.

In addition to Vps34, the class II PI 3-kinases are candidates for the
enzymes that generate PI3P in Schwann cells (Maffucci and Falasca,
2014). Moreover, there are a number of examples where Class II
PI3Ks generate the pools of PI3P targeted by MTMR phosphatases (Srivastava et al.,
2009; Velichkova et al., 2010; Razidlo et al., 2011 ;
Jean et al.,
2012; Kutchukian et al., 2016; Sabha et al., 2016; Figure 1(a)).
Therefore, we considered whether PI3K-C2β might enzymatically oppose
the MTMR2-MTMR13 phosphatase complex in the regulation of PI3P. To
test this, we generated Mtmr13−/−
Pik3c2β−/− double mutant mice and
compared the nerve pathology of these animals to that of
Mtmr13−/− mice. We found that
the additional deletion of PI3K-C2β did not significantly reduce the
prevalence of myelin outfoldings in
Mtmr13−/− nerves (Figure 9). In
summary, genetic elimination of Vps34 or PI3K-C2β, two manipulations
known to lower PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 levels (Devereaux et al.,
2013; Ikonomov et al., 2015), has no impact on the prevalence
of myelin outfoldings in Mtmr13−/−
mice.

Discussion
Mtmr13 Provides a Unique Function That Cannot be Overcome by
Overexpressing Its Catalytically Active Binding Partner, Mtmr2
MTMR13 is a 208-kDa, multidomain scaffold protein that contains an
inactive version of a PI 3-phosphatase domain (Senderek et al., 2003;
Robinson and
Dixon, 2005). MTMR13 contains a differentially expressed
in normal versus neoplastic (DENN) domain, which activates Rab GTPases
by catalyzing guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate (GTP)
exchange in these regulators of membrane trafficking (Yoshimura et al.,
2010; Jean et al., 2012; Figure 1). MTMR13 and the
catalytically active PI 3-phosphatase MTMR2 form a stable complex
thought to function by dephosphorylating PI3P and PI(3,5)P2
on endosomal-lysosomal membranes (Robinson and Dixon, 2005;
Berger
et al., 2006; Jean et al., 2012; Ng et al.,
2013).

A number of findings support a specific but limited role of MTMR13 in
endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, rather than a strict requirement for
the protein for endocytosis or lysosome biogenesis (Ng et al.,
2013; Jean et al., 2015). In Drosophila
macrophages, orthologs of MTMR13, MTMR2, and Rab21 function together
in a complex which promotes the recycling of membrane proteins from
endosomes. In this context, endosomal recycling requires both the GDP
or GTP exchange factor activity of the DENN domain and the PI
3-phosphatase activity of Mtm (Jean et al., 2012). The
regulation of endosomal trafficking by SET (domain) binding factor
(Sbf)/MTMR13 influences fly macrophage cell shape by controlling
cortical actin remodeling (Jean et al., 2012). The
coordinated action of MTMR13 and Rab21 on endosomes has also been
shown to positively regulate starvation-induced autophagy in HeLa
cells (Jean
et al., 2015).

How the roles for MTMR13/Sbf in endosomal trafficking, actin dynamics,
and autophagy, largely identified in Drosophila cells
and mammalian cancer cell lines (Jean et al., 2015), relate
to the apparently critical function of the protein in myelinating
Schwann cells is unclear. The finding that canonical, Atg7-dependent
autophagy is dispensable for developmental myelination by Schwann
cells (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2015; Jang et al., 2015),
suggests that MTMR13’s role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion may not
be responsible for the myelin outfoldings associated with CMT4B2.

With an in vitro model of CMT4B2 available, we
investigated the relationship between the MTMR2-MTMR13 complex and its
lipid substrates. Whether the distinctive myelin outfoldings of CMT4B2
(MTMR13-deficiency) are caused by elevated PI3P or
PI(3,5)P2 is unclear. We probed this question by
overexpressing MTMR2 in Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG
explant cultures, a manipulation predicted to reduce PI3P and
PI(3,5)P2 levels. We found that MTMR2 expression
reduced the prevalence of myelin outfoldings by about 25%, thus
partially suppressing the CMT4B-like phenotype. Our lentiviral
expression strategy brought MTMR2 protein levels to about threefold
higher than that of endogenous Mtmr2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants (about
1.5-fold higher than that of endogenous Mtmr2 in wild-type SC-DRG
explants). Thus, we have expressed MTMR2 at supraphysiological levels
but not at an extreme level of overexpression.

Our findings using myelinating DRG explant cultures suggest that lowering
cellular PI3P or PI(3,5)P2 moderately reduced the formation
of myelin outfoldings, which form in the absence of Mtmr13. Thus,
although catalytically inactive itself, Mtmr13 may promote the PI
3-phosphatase activity of Mtmr2 during normal myelination. This may be
accomplished by physically stabilizing the Mtmr2 protein or recruiting
Mtmr2 to endosomal membranes where PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 are
present (Robinson
and Dixon, 2005; Jean et al., 2012; Ng et al.,
2013). Our findings using explant cultures are consistent
with the hypothesis that elevated PI3P or PI(3,5)P2
contributes to the myelin abnormalities of CMT4B and suggests that, in
Schwann cells, MTMR13 acts as a negative regulator of
PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 abundance. A genetic experiment in
Drosophila also indicated a role of an MTMR13
ortholog as a negative regulator of PI3P (Jean et al., 2012).
Analogous studies of Mtmr2 have suggested that elevated
PI(3,5)P2 leads to excessive longitudinal myelin
growth and CMT4B-like outfoldings (Vaccari et al., 2011).

To further probe whether elevated PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 might cause
the myelin outfoldings associated with Mtmr13 loss, we performed two
in vivo genetic experiments. We generated
double-knockout mice that lacked both Mtmr13 and one of two specific
PI 3-kinases known to generate PI3P (Vps34 or PI3K-C2β; Figure 1;
Devereaux
et al., 2013; Ikonomov et al., 2015).
Intriguingly, we found that neither the Schwann cell-specific deletion
of Vps34 nor the global knockout of PI3K-C2β had any significant
impact on the prevalence of myelin outfoldings in
Mtmr13−/− sciatic nerves.
Thus, mutations likely to yield substantial reductions of PI3P, and
presumably PI(3,5)P2, did not suppress the hallmark
Mtmr13−/− phenotype,
suggesting that the elevation of these phosphoinositides in Schwann
cells does not contribute significantly to myelin outfoldings in
models of CMT4B2. This in vivo finding might be
viewed as somewhat at odds with our result using
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG cultures,
where heterologous expression of MTMR2 moderately reduced the
prevalence of myelin outfoldings (25% reduction). However, it is worth
noting that the overexpression of MTMR2 and the deletion of a
PI3P-generating PI3K may differ somewhat in terms of impact on the
pathway.

As noted earlier, reexpression of MTMR2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants only
partially suppressed the myelin outfolding phenotype, indicating that
Mtmr13 may have critical functions other than stabilizing Mtmr2. The
activation of Rab GTPases is a formally
PI3P/PI(3,5)P2-independent function of MTMR13 which is
likely relevant to our findings. Once activated, Rab GTPases recruit
specific effector proteins to membrane microdomains, thereby driving
the highly specific membrane fission and fusion events that underpin
vectorial membrane transport (Zhen and Stenmark, 2015).
In our experiment, even with MTMR2 reexpressed,
Mtmr13−/− Schwann cells would
still lack the Rab GTPase-activating function of MTMR13’s highly
conserved DENN (GDP or GTP exchange factor) domain. Rab21, Rab28, and
Rab27a have each been implicated as targets of the MTMR13 DENN domain;
these or other Rab GTPases may be dysregulated in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRGs, suggesting
a possible cause of altered endosomal-lysosomal trafficking in CMT4B
(Yoshimura
et al., 2010; Jean et al., 2012; Abuzenadah et al.,
2013).

A limitation of this study is that direct measurements of
phosphoinositide levels were not carried out. However, previous
studies have demonstrated that the PI3Ks Vps34 and PI3K-C2β contribute
significantly to the production of PI3P, from which
PI(3,5)P2 is derived (Devereaux et al., 2013;
Ikonomov
et al., 2015). Moreover, genetic loss of PI3K-C2β
isoforms in flies, mice, and mammalian cell lines has previously been
shown to robustly suppress phenotypes associated with the loss of MTMR
phosphatases and pseudophosphatases (Srivastava et al., 2009;
Velichkova
et al., 2010; Razidlo et al., 2011; Jean et al.,
2012; Kutchukian et al., 2016; Sabha et al., 2016). These
studies support our conclusion that the genetic approaches used herein
provide insight into the function of Mtmr13 in myelination.

In summary, while our findings suggest that suppressed Mtmr2 PI
3-phosphatase activity contributes to the formation of myelin
outfoldings in Mtmr13−/− SC-DRGs, our work
simultaneously suggests that additional Mtmr13 functions, such as Rab
GTPase activation and the scaffolding of endosomal regulators, are
also critical for myelin homeostasis in Schwann cells, particularly
in vivo.

Balanced Phosphoinositide Kinase and Phosphatase Enzymatic
Activity
A group of human genetic diseases are caused by loss of
function mutations in phosphoinositide phosphatases.
These include demyelinating CMT (MTMR2, MTMR5, MTMR13, and FIG4),
myotubular myopathy (MTM1), cancer (phosphatase and TENsin homolog),
and the multisystem disorders Lowe Syndrome (oculocerebrorenal ) and
Joubert Syndrome (INPP5E) (Majerus and York, 2009). As
such mutations are predicted, and in some cases demonstrated, to lead
to elevations in the cellular abundance of the relevant
phosphoinositide substrates, understanding how specific pairs of PI
kinases and PI phosphatases enzymatically oppose each other is of
interest from both a basic science and a therapeutic perspective
(Figure
1).

A number of findings have indicated that the inhibition of specific PI3K
isoforms can relieve the cellular defects associated with the loss of
individual myotubularin PI 3-phosphatases, likely by decreasing the
abundance of PI3P or PI(3,5)P2. For example, the inhibition
of Class II PI3Ks has been shown to ameliorate trafficking and
signaling defects triggered by the absence of myotubularin
phosphatases in Drosophila and mammalian cells (Srivastava et al.,
2009; Velichkova et al., 2010; Razidlo et al., 2011; Jean et al.,
2012). Perhaps most notable, genetic deletion of PI3K-C2β
has been demonstrated to restore muscle function to and improve the
life span of Mtm1-deficient mice (Kutchukian et al.,
2016; Sabha et al., 2016). Finally, genetic or pharmacological
manipulations known to lower PI(3,5)P2 levels have been
found to decrease the prevalence of myelin outfoldings in nerves or
explant cultures from Mtmr2−/− mice,
suggesting that the pathology of CMT4B1 may be caused by elevated
PI(3,5)P2 (Vaccari et al., 2011). The
work we present here, which is focused on the catalytically inactive
Mtmr13 protein’s role in myelin homeostasis, suggests a less direct
correlation between elevated PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 and phenotypic
consequences than has been reported for the catalytically active
myotubularin PI 3-phosphatases. However, in light of the
aforementioned studies of Mtmr2 function (Vaccari et al., 2011), and
given the strong physical association of the Mtmr2 and Mtmr13 proteins
(Robinson
and Dixon, 2005; Berger et al., 2006),
further investigations aimed at identifying the PI kinases responsible
for generating those pools of PI3P and PI(3,5)P2 that are
targeted by the MTMR2-MTMR13 phosphatase complex remain warranted.

Endolysosomal Phosphoinositides in Schwann Cell Myelination
We found that the heterologous expression of MTMR2 in
Mtmr13−/− SC-DRG explants
suppresses myelination globally. In these experiments, the exogenously
expressed MTMR2 protein is present at a level only about 1.5-fold
higher than that of the endogenous protein, making it unlikely that
the suppression of myelination results from an extreme overexpression.
We propose that modest overexpression of MTMR2 lowers both PI3P and
PI(3,5)P2 levels such that myelination is blunted but
not abolished in Mtmr13−/− explant
cultures. In this context, blunted myelination may be caused by a
moderate impairment of endosomal-lysosomal trafficking. Consistent
with our assertion, there is in vivo evidence
indicating that the depletion of PI3P or PI(3,5)P2 in
Schwann cells impairs myelination. First, Schwann cell-specific
deletion of Vps34, the Class III PI3K thought
responsible for generating more than half of cellular PI3P, leads to
arrested myelination during early postnatal development (Logan et al.,
2017; Figure 1). Moreover, deletion of FIG4, a phosphatase
that stimulates PI(3,5)P2 production by activating the
5-kinase PIKfyve, leads to developmental hypomyelination and
demyelination (Vaccari et al., 2015; Figure 1). It is unlikely
that the overexpression of MTMR2 lowers PI3P and PI(3,5)P2
levels as significantly as does the loss of Vps34, a perturbation that
severely retards developmental myelination (Logan et al., 2017). It is
also worth noting that the loss of the FIG4 phosphatase has been
reported to moderately reduce PI(3,5)P2 levels without
altering PI3P levels (Chow et al., 2007; Vaccari et al.,
2011; Zolov et al., 2012). Such findings are consistent with
the observation that the loss of Vps34 retards myelination much more
significantly than does the loss of FIG4 (Vaccari et al., 2015; Logan et al.,
2017). In summary, we propose that reducing PI3P or
PI(3,5)P2 abundance to subphysiological levels (via
MTMR2 over-expression) retards myelination by interfering with
endosomal-lysosomal trafficking, a perturbation that likely impacts
the signaling of key transmembrane receptors, such as the ErbB2/3
tyrosine kinase complex (Lee et al., 2017; Logan et al.,
2017). Our findings suggest that normal myelination by
Schwann cells requires that the level of the PI 3-phosphatase MTMR2 is
maintained within a relatively narrow range.

In summary, we describe here an in vitro model of the
demyelinating peripheral neuropathy CMT4B2, which is caused by genetic
loss of the MTMR13 pseudophosphatase. The model, which consists of DRG
explants from Mtmr13−/− mice,
recapitulates the distinctive myelin outfoldings of the human
condition. In addition, myelinating
Mtmr13−/− explant cultures contain
reduced levels of Mtmr2, an active PI 3-phosphatase and key binding
partner of Mtmr13. This finding parallels what has been observed in
intact sciatic nerves from Mtmr13−/− mice
and further supports a role for Mtmr13 in stabilizing the Mtmr2
protein. We used both the novel in vitro model and
in vivo mouse models of CMT4B2 to examine how
genetic manipulation of PI3P/PI(3,5)P2 levels might impact
formation of the myelin outfoldings, the hallmark feature of
MTMR13-deficiency. In aggregate, our findings suggest that the MTMR13
scaffold protein likely has critical functions other than stabilizing
MTMR2 to achieve an adequate level of PI 3-phosphatase activity. We
anticipate that the in vitro model described here
will be useful for further investigations of the biochemical and
cellular functions of Mtmr13.

Summary
We describe an in vitro model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 4B2
peripheral neuropathy, which is caused by mutations in
MTMR13. We validate myelinating cultures from
Mtmr13-deficient mice as a model and examine the relationship between Mtmr13
and its binding partner Mtmr2.
