brain injury (TBI). There is emerging evidence of the detrimental effects from
repeated mild TBIs (rmTBIs). rmTBI manifests its own unique set of behavioral
and neuropathological changes. A subset of individuals exposed to rmTBI develop
permanent behavioral and pathological consequences, defined postmortem as
chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We have combined components of two classic
rodent models of TBI, the controlled cortical impact model and the weight drop
model, to develop a repeated mild closed head injury (rmCHI) that produces
long-term deficits in several behaviors that correlate with neuropathological
changes. Mice receiving rmCHI performed differently from 1-hit or sham controls
on the elevated plus maze; these deficits persist up to 6 months postinjury
(MPI). rmCHI mice performed worse than 1-hit and control sham mice at 2 MPI and
6 MPI on the Morris water maze. Mice receiving rmCHI exhibited significant
atrophy of the corpus callosum at both 2 MPI and 6 MPI, as assessed by
stereological volume analysis. Stereological analysis also revealed significant
loss of cortical neurons in comparison with 1-hit and controls. Moreover, both
of these pathological changes correlated with behavioral impairments. In human
tau transgenic mice, rmCHI induced increases in hyperphosphorylated paired
helical filament 1 tau in the hippocampus. This suggests that strategies to
restore myelination or reduce neuronal loss may ameliorate the behavioral
deficits observed following rmCHI and that rmCHI may model chronic traumatic
encephalopathy in human tau mice.

Introduction
In the United States, an estimated 5.3 million people are living with a disability
that is directly related to a traumatic brain injury (TBI; Langlois and Sattin, 2005), resulting in
direct and indirect costs of US$56 to 221 billion every year (Coronado et al., 2012). Adding to this
astonishing figure, 1.7 million Americans a year suffer a TBI leading to
hospitalization (Faul et al.,
2010). While 75% of these patients sustain only a mild
TBI (mTBI), also referred to as a concussion (Gerberding and Binder, 2003), 43% of
patients discharged after acute TBI hospitalization develop a long-term disability
(Rutland-Brown et al.,
2006).

Concussion, or mTBI, is defined as a pathophysiological process affecting the brain,
induced by direct or indirect biomechanical forces, that may lead to acute
neurological deficits that typically resolve without structural injuries (Herring et al., 2011).
Taking this definition into account, it is estimated that 1.4 to 3.8 million
concussions annually in the United States do not lead to hospitalization (Faul et al., 2010; Laskowski et al., 2015).
Compounding evidence suggests that single or repeated mild traumatic brain injuries
(rmTBI) can lead to long-lasting cognitive and emotional deficits in individuals
with mTBI or rmTBI (Bazarian
et al., 2005; Bryant
et al., 2010; Laskowski et al., 2015), as well as neuropathologies including chronic
neuroinflammation and tauopathies such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE;
Mckee et al., 2009).
Clearly, rmTBI is a major health problem that lacks definitive incident
reporting.

Primary injury associated with TBI can result in acute axonal swelling and shearing
(Johnson et al., 2013a, 2013b), microglial activation (Ramlackhansingh et al.,
2011; Johnson et al., 2013a,
2013b), neuronal loss (Raghupathi, 2004), hemorrhage, and
blood–brain barrier disruption (Baskaya et al., 1997; Greve and Zink, 2009). Secondary injury
cascades associated with these events include white matter atrophy, chronic and
dynamic neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Of particular interest, disruptions of
major white matter tracts following TBI have also been observed in both humans and
rodents. In humans with a single TBI, 25% atrophy of the corpus callosum is observed
chronically, concurrent with activated microglia within the corpus callosum (Johnson
et al., 2013a). White matter abnormalities have also been observed in
humans following multiple concussions or traumatic brain injuries, especially in
athletes (Johnson et al.,
2013b; Tremblay
et al., 2014; Multani
et al., 2016). In a rodent model of repeated mTBI, a sustained
inflammatory response was observed in corpus callosum up to 7 weeks postinjury
(Shitaka et al.,
2011), and in a study at more chronic time points of 6 and 12 months
postinjury (MPI), 10% to 20% corpus callosum thinning occurred (as measured by
thickness in two-dimensional sections, not total volume). White matter thinning was
observed in combination with increased astroglial and microglial activation up to 12
months post-rmTBI; however, elevated levels of ß-amyloid and abnormally
phosphorylated tau (pTau) were not detected in C57Bl/6J mice (Mouzon et al., 2014).

Modeling TBI in rodents will always lack some components of the human condition, due
to size differences, because rodents are lissencephalic, differences in rotational
forces, and the wide diversity and range of mechanisms responsible for human
injuries. One solution is the development and use of a range of animal models. In
acute TBI, correlates of hippocampal neuropathology and memory performance have been
reported (Hicks et al.,
1993; Haus et al.,
2016) in the rat. Some rodent models of rmTBI include impacting a mouse
skull directly using a homemade or commercially available pneumatic device (Laurer et al., 2001; Uryu et al., 2002; Prins et al., 2010; Shitaka et al., 2011),
dropping a weight down a tube onto a closed head of a suspended mouse on a KimWipe
(Meehan et al., 2012)
or aluminum foil (Kane et al.,
2012), and a closed head impact model of engineered rotational
acceleration (CHIMERA) focusing on precise control of injuries with unrestricted
head movement allowing for coup–contrecoup injuries (Namjoshi et al., 2014). Models that do not
resect the skin to impact the skull or dura directly are commonly referred to as
repeated mild closed head injuries (rmCHI), a subset of rmTBI.

In 2001, McIntosh reported that mild head injury made the brain more vulnerable to a
second concussive hit (Laurer
et al., 2001), that repetitive TBI accelerates brain ß-amyloid
accumulation, oxidative stress, and cognitive impairment (Uryu et al., 2002), and that there is a
temporal window of vulnerability after rmTBI where a second concussion within 3 to 5
days can induce exacerbated axonal damage and greater behavioral dysfunction (Longhi et al., 2005). In
rats, rmTBI 1 or 3 days apart results in significant tissue loss on magnetic
resonance imaging compared with shams or a single injury, whereas extending the
interval to 1 week between injuries resulted in no more injury than a single hit
(Huang et al., 2013).
Crawford compared the behavioral and pathological consequences in a mouse model of
single versus repetitive injury (five injuries given at 48-hr intervals)
administered by an electromagnetic controlled impactor, demonstrating a
reproducible, simple, and noninvasive model with behavioral impairments after a
single injury and increasing deficits after multiple injuries accompanied by
increased focal and diffuse pathology (Mouzon et al., 2012,
2014).

Using mice expressing human tau (hTau) on a mouse tau knockout background (Andorfer
et al., 2003), Ojo et al. (2016) showed that two injuries weekly over a period of 3
or 4 months resulted in impairments in cerebral blood flow and white matter damage,
which was accompanied by a twofold increase in total tau levels and mild increases
in tau oligomers/conformers and pTau (Thr231) species in brain gray matter; however,
neurofibrillary astroglial tangles, neuropil threads, or perivascular foci of tau
immunoreactivity were not observed. Comparing a single hit to repetitive mTBI by
Burns found dendrite spine loss and chronic white matter inflammation in a mouse
model of repetitive head trauma (Winston et al., 2016; Main et al., 2017). Further,
Nedergaard and colleagues have reported impairment of glymphatic pathway function in
the progression of tau pathology following TBI (Iliff et al., 2014). There are a
number of excellent reviews that deal with the issues of modeling human repetitive
TBI, and the even more difficult task of replicating the features of CTE in animal
models (Abisambra and Scheff, 2014; Brody et al., 2015; Johnson et al., 2015; Ojo
et al., 2016; Wojnarowicz et al., 2017).

In an effort to develop a robust, high-throughput rmCHI model that can be easily
replicated across laboratories with precise control over injury parameters, we
sought to use commercially available components and to determine if a model of
closed head injury with components of acceleration–deceleration forces in an
unrestrained head would produce white matter tract neuropathology representative of
that observed in the clinical setting. Furthermore, we sought a model that
demonstrates external validity, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits in
variety of tasks that are sustained chronically (Henderson et al., 2013; Malkesman et al., 2013). We
hypothesized that rmCHI, but not a single mild injury, would produce chronic
behavioral changes and pathological abnormalities that would correlate with those
behavioral changes. We predicted that the extent of behavioral impairment would
correlate with the underlying extent of pathology.

To our knowledge, there are no reports correlating the relationship of white matter
or cortical pathology with multiple measures of behavioral function in mice with
rmCHI. Therefore, we focused on assessing corpus callosum neuropathology following
rmCHI given the common finding of white matter damage in humans. We also assessed
cortical neuron number below the site of impact. We report here on the association
of robust, chronic behavioral changes and learning deficits with corpus callosum
atrophy, long-term neuroinflammation, and cortical neuronal loss. Surprisingly,
rmCHI behavioral impairments and associated pathology were not observed in
immunodeficient non-obese diabetic (NOD)-scid gamma (NSGs) mice, whereas
hyperphosphorylation of tau was observed in 10-month-old hTau mice exposed to rmCHI,
but not in age-matched littermates.

Material and Methods
Animals and Injury Paradigm
All procedures were carried out under the approval of the UCI IACUC committee
(#2010-2945) in an AAALAC-accredited vivarium (#000238). All studies used 9- to
10-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) unless otherwise
noted. Prior to the procedures, mice were acclimated for 1 week and handled for
3 days, 5 min per day. Components of both the controlled cortical impact (CCI)
device (Figure 1(a);
TBI-0310 Head Impactor, Precision Systems and Instrumentation, LLC, Fairfax
Station, VA) and the weight drop model were combined. A foam bed modified from
“Marmarou foam” (Type E Bed, Foam to Size, Inc., Ashland, VA) was modified to
fit on the stage of the CCI device (5.25″ × 2.75″ × 17.25″), and a trench was
cut out to position tubing and a nose cone to keep the animal under anesthesia
for the duration of the procedure.

Figure 1. Model of repeated mild closed head injury (rmCHI) used in long-term
behavioral testing of mice. Following 4 min of isoflurane anesthesia
exposure to shave and prepare the mouse head for impacts, mice are
positioned atop Marmarou foam placed in the TBI-0310-controlled cortical
impactor device (a). Lab tape is lightly applied to pin the ears back
and flatten the head onto the foam (b) while positioning the piston
directly above the dorsal aspect of the sagittal suture. After 7 min of
initial knockdown in anesthesia, an injury is delivered to the mouse
head. Stills from a time lapse video (10 frames per second) show the
mouse receiving an impact, followed by depression and rotation into the
foam, followed by a quick rebound toward the piston (c). Three main
experiments were performed to (d) assess baseline injury parameters,
comparing hits at a velocity of 2.5 m/s to 5 m/s and a 3-hit versus
5-hit paradigm; (e) compare the number of hits in a 1-, 5- and 10-hit
paradigm; and (f) compare the behavioral and pathological deficits at 6
MPI with deficits observed at 2 MPI.

TBI = traumatic brain injury; MPI = months postinjury; EPM = elevated
plus maze; FST = forced swim test; MWM = Morris water maze.

All animals spent 7 min under anesthesia, including shams; 2 min induction at
2.5% isoflurane, and 2 min to mark the tail, shave the head, and apply
ophthalmic ointment. The animal was placed onto the modified Marmarou foam and
positioned to breathe 1.5% isoflurane from a nose cone. Lab tape was lightly
applied to the ears and fixed to the foam to position the head level and prevent
movement during breathing (Figure 1(b)). A 5-mm diameter probe tip was aligned midline to the
sagittal suture with the anterior edge of the tip parallel to a virtual line
drawn across the posterior-most aspect of the eyes (roughly equivalent to a
centerline impact 1 to 2 mm posterior to bregma). The mouse was at the CCI
station for 3 min until an impact with speed 5.0 m/s, 1.0 mm depth, and 50 ms
dwell time (slow-motion video of impact shows displacement of head into
supporting foam pad, Figure
1(c)). In total, mice are under anesthesia for 7 min from knockdown
to TBI impact. The isoflurane percentages were designed to minimize head
movement from respiration while zeroing the piston and during impact while still
keeping the animal unresponsive to a toe pinch reflex. Following impact, animals
were moved to a recovery area where righting time was recorded. Sham animals
underwent the same 7-min procedure with anesthesia over 5 or 10 days but were
not impacted. In all experiments, mice were randomly assigned to groups, and
observers were blind to group during all behavioral and histological
evaluations.

Assessment of Injury Severity Parameters in rmCHI
To identify injury parameter thresholds that do or do not produce similar results
to a baseline injury of 5 m/s, 5 hits over 5 days paradigm (ascertained during
pilot experiments), we tested either half speed (2.5 m/s) or less hits (3 hits).
Mice (n = 12/group) were divided into four groups: Shams, 3
hits at 5 m/s, 5 hits at 2.5 m/s, or 5 hits at 5 m/s (as a positive control).
Mice hit 3 times were hit every other day, and mice hit 5 times were hit every
24 hr. Mice were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) at 1 month postinjury
(MPI) and the Morris water maze (MWM) at 2 MPI. Animals were sacrificed at 9
weeks postinjury and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were excised,
immersed in 30% sucrose/4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and snap-frozen in −50°C
isopentane prior to histological analysis.

Comparison of 1-Hit, 5-Hit, and 10-Hit rmCHI Parameters
After determining injury severity parameters, we tested whether the injury
response was exacerbated by 10 hits, expanded the battery of behavioral
measures, and quantified the pathological response. Mice were grouped into four
conditions: Shams (5 or 10 isoflurane exposures), a single impact
(n = 11) on the last day, 5 hits over 10 days (once every
48 hr, n = 9), or 10 hits over 10 days (once every 24 hr,
n = 13). The two sham groups received either 5 procedures
over 10 days (once every 48 hr) or 10 sham procedures over 10 days. As there
were no differences in any measures between the sham groups, shams were combined
in all statistical analysis (n = 14). Single-impact animals
received an impact on the final day of hits of both 5- and 10-hit groups to
align all groups a common 0 days postinjury (DPI) start date. Mice were tested
on the rotarod, ladder beam, EPM, MWM, and the tail suspension test (TST) and
were sacrificed 2 MPI.

Are rmCHI Deficits Sustained 2 and 6 MPI?
Having observed deficits at 1 and 2 MPI, we tested if the deficits were sustained
out to 6 MPI. Mice were grouped into three conditions: Sham
(n = 7), a single impact (n = 11), or 10 hits
over 10 days (once every 24 hr, n = 9). Mice were tested on EPM
at 1 MPI and 6 MPI, the forced swim test (FST) at 2 MPI and 6 MPI, and MWM at 6
MPI. Two animals from each group were sacrificed at 2 MPI for pilot data for
another experiment; the remaining mice were sacrificed at 6 MPI.

Are immunodeficient NSG Mice Comparable With C57Bl/6J Mice?
Can immunodeficient mice be used to test cell therapies in this model of rmCHI?
Ten-week-old male NSG mice (Jackson Laboratories, catalog # 005557) were divided
into four groups (n = 12/group): Shams, 1 hit at 5.0 m/s, 5
hits at 2.5 m/s, 5 hits at 5. 0 m/s. Following rmCHI, mice were tested on the
EPM at 1 MPI and MWM at 2 MPI. Mice were sacrificed at 2 MPI.

Does rmCHI Exacerbate Tau Phosphorylation in hTau Mice?
Can we model CTE using mice expressing hTau? Seven-month-old male and female
transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type (WT) 4 repeat tau (hTau; Chabrier et al., 2014)
were divided into four groups: Shams (n = 5 WT and 3 hTau) and
5 hits at 2.5 m/s (n = 6 WT and 5 hTau). Following rmCHI, mice
were sacrificed at 3 MPI (10 months of age, when elevated hyperphosphorylated
tau is not present in uninjured hTau mice). Group numbers were too low for
behavioral testing; however, experimental conditions were randomized prior to
injury so that histological and biochemical testing was performed blind.

Behavioral Assessments
Rotarod
Mice were tested for motor function, control, and balance using the rotarod
task at 1, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 35 DPI. Mice were placed onto a rotarod device
(Economex Rota-Rod, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) for 1 min to
acclimate, followed by 2 min of learning/acclimation at a steady rate of 5
revolutions per minute (rpm). Animals falling off the beam were immediately
repositioned atop the beam during this 2-min learning phase. Following 2 min
of acclimation to the task, two training trials were performed, followed by
five testing trials. Daily latency to fall measurements were an average of
the five testing trials. Both training and testing trials began at 3 rpm,
accelerating at 2.0 rpm/s for the duration of each trial. Between each
training and testing trial, any urine left on the beam was removed, and the
beam was cleaned and dried.

Horizontal ladder beam
To assess motor function, mice were tested using the horizontal ladder beam.
Foot faults, or missteps, were tabulated from video recordings of animals
traversing the horizontal ladder with variable rung spacing (Cummings et al.,
2007). Testing was performed in a dark room with a light source
placed at the starting end of the ladder to motivate movement away from the
light, into a closed dark cage at the end of the ladder. An enclosure, just
bigger than the mouse, sits atop the ladder to allow a track for mice to
walk in a line to the opposite end. Three successfully traversed trials in
total were scored, using total forepaw missteps over three trials as the
outcome measure.

Elevated plus maze
Anxiety and risk-taking behavior was assessed by comparing time spent in open
arms, or by amount of entries into open arms. Animals were placed at the
center point of the EPM apparatus (Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg,
VA) 29″ off of the ground, facing an open arm extending 13.5″ from the
center. Mice could move freely between unenclosed and enclosed closed arms,
7.5″ high walls. Trials lasted 5 min and were analyzed by EthoVision XT
software (Version 8.0.5, Noldus Information Technology, Leesburg, VA). As
indicated in the results, animals in were either tested under ambient light
conditions or in a dark room with near-infrared illumination under the maze
arms to allow for contrast and camera detection. Outcome measures gathered
were total distance moved, entries into open and closed arms, and time spent
in open/closed arms.

Morris water maze
The MWM is a well-characterized task to assess spatial learning and memory.
The maze consists of a circular metal pool (44″ diameter) filled with water
3 inches from the top. White paint was used to dye the water and hide a
platform (5″ diameter) 1 cm below the surface and out of the animal’s
sightline. Water was maintained at 25°C to 30°C. Mice underwent 4 trials, 60
s max, per day over 5 days of testing. The platform remained stationary in a
particular quadrant; however, the entry point changed with each trial, and
the order changed each day. Mice used cues outside the maze (various
poster-board shapes fixed to the testing room walls) to spatially navigate
to the ‘hidden' platform. EthoVision XT software recorded
each trial, quantifying latency to reach platform and time spent in each
quadrant.

Forced swim test
The FST is a measure of depressive-like behavior. Mice were placed into a
2,000 ml glass beaker filled with 7 to 8 cm of water (25°C) for 6 min.
Trials were video recorded and analyzed using EthoVision XT, allowing for
simple quantification of time moving versus not moving, and assessment of
relative ‘mobility'. Moving was determined by calculating
the duration for which the center point of the animal was changing location
with a start velocity set at 1.25 cm/s and a stop velocity set at 1.0 cm/s.
Mobility was quantified using changes in pixel area of the subject between
samples collected. Standard software thresholds were used to segment
mobility into ‘immobile', ‘mobile', and
‘high mobility' levels, where the immobile threshold
was set to 6%, and the high mobility threshold was set to 18%. Mice were
tested on the FST in Experiment 2 at 2 and 6 MPI. A single exposure was
used, not the 5-day repetitive variant of the FST, which has a learning
component (Mul et al.,
2016).

Tail suspension test
The TST is used to assess depression. Mice were hung from a beam raised 12″
off of a surface, affixed by a piece of tape at the tip of their tail. Mice
tried to grab their tails and climb up to right themselves. Assessment of
depression-like behavior was measured by scoring time immobile, or time not
struggling to right themselves. More depressive-like behavior is indicated
by more time immobile. A single 5-min trial was conducted under normal
ambient light conditions.

Immunohistochemistry
Personnel blind to experimental group performed all histological analyses. Serial
30-μm coronal brain sections were collected from mice sacrificed at 9 weeks
postinjury. Tissue was stained in free floating wells. Endogenous peroxide activity
was quenched with hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 20 min, followed by cell
permeabilization in 0.1% Triton-X. Tissue was blocked in fetal bovine serum and
donkey serum for an hour prior to primary antibody incubation. Primary antibodies
were incubated overnight at room temperature and included rat antimyelin basic
protein (Millipore, #MAB386, 1:800), rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako, #019-19741, 1:1000),
rabbit antiglial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako, #Z0334, 1:10,000), mouse
anti-NeuN (Millipore, #MAB377, 1:1000), rabbit antineural/glial antigen 2 (NG2;
Millipore, #AB5320, 1:800), mouse anti-CP13, and paired helical filament 1 (PHF-1;
generous gift of Peter Davies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Tissue was
incubated with secondary antibodies for an hour at room temperature. Secondary
antibodies used include donkey anti-rabbit F(ab’)2 biotin conjugated
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, #711-066-152, 1:500), donkey anti-mouse
F(ab’)2 biotin conjugated (Jackson, #715-066-151, 1:500), donkey
anti-rat F(ab’)2 biotin conjugated (Jackson, #712-066-153, 1:500), and
donkey anti-rabbit F(ab’)2 AF647 conjugated (Jackson, #711-606-152,
1:500) for NG2 immunofluorescent labeling. Following incubation with ABC Kit (Vector
Labs, #PK-6100), DAB substrate was added to visualize antigens (Vector Labs,
SK-4100). Tissue was mounted onto gelatin-coated slides and counterstained with
methyl green to visualize nuclei. NG2 immunofluorescent sections were counterstained
with Hoechst.

All images were captured on an Olympus BX60 microscope with a UPlanApo 10x/NA0.40
lens or Uplan FL20x/NA0.50 lens, and an Optronics Microfire A/R camera, with the
exception of images in Figure
11 that were captured on an IX71 microscope and an Optronics
PictureFrame. Scale bars were added using ImageJ and images of a stage micrometer
using identical settings.

Quantification
Thirty-micrometer sections were stained with cresyl violet for quantification of the
corpus callosum. Contours of the corpus callosum were drawn using StereoInvestigator
software v11.08.01 (MicroBrightField, Inc., Williston, VT) on every 12th section to
evaluate estimated volume in a systematic, nonbiased, design-based approach.
Anterior and posterior limits of corpus callosum were bound by sections that
contained intact corpus callosum connecting the two hemispheres in the same coronal
plane (Figure 5(b)). A
100-μm grid was laid down to assess corpus callosum volume; the coefficient of error
for each animal was less than 0.10. The optical fractionator probe was used to
quantify NeuN immunopositive cortical neurons in every 12th section. Anterior and
posterior borders were determined by where corpus callosum was intact between both
hemispheres. NeuN+ neurons were counted bilaterally, and borders were
contoured based on anatomical landmarks as follows: A ventral limit was established
by contouring a horizontal line form the most dorsal point of both thalami,
extending to the most lateral aspect of the cortex. The corpus callosum was used as
the ventral limit, until intersecting with the extended thalamic border. On each
hemisphere, a medial limit was drawn extending from the point at which the cingulate
gyrus extended into the cortex (Figure 6(b)). Using a 750 × 750 μm grid with a 30 × 30 μm counting
frame, a 10-μm optical fractionator probe was used to count NeuN+ cells.
A 100-μm grid was laid down to assess cortical volume using Cavalieri estimator. The
optical fractionator probe was used to quantify NG2+ immunopositive
oligodendrocyte precursors. From 30-μm serial coronal sections, every 12th section
was assessed. Corpus callosum borders were drawn as previously mentioned. Using a
200 × 200 μm grid with a 50 × 50 μm counting frame, a 12-μm optical fractionator
probe was used to count NG2+. Coefficient of error (CE) values are
reported in the Results section.

Western Blots
Following cardiac perfusion with phosphate-buffered saline, brains were removed and
frozen on dry ice for biochemical analysis. Proteins were extracted in tissue
protein extraction reagent buffer with protease/phosphatase inhibitors cocktail and
analyzed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Western
blots. The following primary antibodies were used: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), AT180 and HT7 (Pierce,
Rockford, IL), MC1, CP13, and PHF-1 (kind gift from Peter Davies, Albert Einstein
College of Medicine), followed by corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Cove, PA). The data are
represented as mean values ± SEM.

Statistical Analyses
Prior to statistical analysis, and blind to treatment group, a Grubbs’ test was
performed to identify potential outliers from each group (α = .05) and removed no
more than a single identified outlier. Final n are shown in graphs
as individual data points, or reported in the F statistic. For
behavioral measures, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for single
time point assessments, and repeated measures two-way ANOVA was performed for
multiple time point assessments (rotarod and MWM tasks). Statistical significance
was set at p < .05 on one-tailed t tests as a
priori predictions were that injured would be worse than shams. Error bars in
figures are SEM. Statistics were computed using Prism 6.

Results
Assessment of Injury Severity Parameters in rmCHI
To characterize a closed head TBI as mild or concussive, we
investigated changes in both velocity and number of hits that would induce
behavioral deficits and neuropathology associated with multiple head injuries to
find the lower limit whereby a single hit produced negligible behavioral or
pathological changes. Righting times using an impact force of 5 m/s were 43.4 s
for shams (±1.9 SEM), 174.5 s for 1-hit (±35.8), 242.7 s for 5-hit (±19.0), and
186.5 s for 10-hit (±10.3) animals, comparable with other rmTBI models of
concussion/mTBI in rodents (Prins et al., 2010,
2013; Namjoshi
et al., 2014; Acabchuk et al., 2016; Nichols et al., 2016).

There was a significant effect of group on time spent in open arms (Figure 2(a)),
F(3, 44) = 16.36, p < .0001. Sham mice
spent less time in open arms compared with both 3 hits at 5 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01) and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .0001) mice, but not compared with 5 hits at 2.5 m/s
mice. In addition, 5 hits at 5.0 m/s mice spent more time in open arms than both
5 hits at 2.5 m/s (Tukey post hoc, p < .0001) and 3 hits at
5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc, p < .05). There was also a
significant effect of group on open arm entries (Figure 2(b)), F(3,
44) = 7.887, p = .0003. Sham mice had less open arm entries
compared with both 3 hits at 5 m/s (Tukey post hoc, p < .05)
and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc, p < .01) mice, but
not compared with 5 hits at 2.5 m/s mice. In addition, 5 hits at 2.5 m/s mice
had less open arm entries compared with both 3 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .05) and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01). In addition, there was a significant effect of
group on total distance traveled (Figure 2(c)), F(3,
44) = 3.681, p = .0189, although Tukey post hoc testing
revealed no differences between any groups.

Figure 2. Increasing the velocity of rmCHI injuries results in behavioral deficits;
reducing the number of hits at full velocity also induces deficits. (a)
In the elevated plus maze test at 1 MPI, mice with 5 hits or 3 hits at
5.0 m/s showed increased time in open arms, F(3,
44) = 16.36, p < .0001. Sham mice spent less time in
open arms compared with both 3 hits at 5 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01) and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .0001) mice. (b) rmCHI increased open arm
entries compared with sham controls and mice with 5 hits at only 2.5
m/s, F(3, 44) = 7.887, p = .0003. (c)
No changes in distance traveled in the elevated plus maze were observed
across any of the groups via Tukey post hoc tests. (d) At 2 MPI, these
same mice were tested for spatial learning using the Morris water maze.
There was a significant interaction of group versus time,
F(12, 176) = 3.278, p = .0003, and
a graded behavioral profile was apparent. Sham mice were able to locate
the platform quicker than both 3 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .0001) and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s mice (Tukey
post hoc, p < .0001). In addition, 5 hits at 2.5 m/s
mice were able to locate the hidden platform faster than both 3 hits at
5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc, p < .01) and 5 hits at 5.0
m/s mice (Tukey post hoc, p < .01).

rmCHI = repeated mild closed head injury; MPI = months postinjury.

At 2 MPI, these same mice were tested for spatial learning using the MWM. There
was a significant interaction of group versus time (Figure 2(d)), F(12,
176) = 3.278, p = .0003, where a graded behavioral profile
became apparent. On Day 5 of testing, sham mice were able to locate the platform
quicker than both 3 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey post hoc,
p < .0001) and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .0001). In addition, 5 hits at 2.5 m/s mice were
able to locate the hidden platform faster than both 3 hits at 5.0 m/s (Tukey
post hoc, p < .01) and 5 hits at 5.0 m/s mice (Tukey post
hoc, p < .01).

Comparison of 1-Hit, 5-Hit, and 10-Hit rmCHI Parameters
Behavior
We assessed sham, 1-hit, 5-hit, and 10-hit animals on the rotarod up to Day
35 postinjury for motor performance on the rotarod. There was a significant
interaction between injury group and latency to fall over time (two-way
repeated measures ANOVA), F(12,172) = 2.354,
p = .008; Figure 3(a). Specifically, mice that
received 10 hits over 10 days showed significant impairments compared with
sham animals at 1 DPI (Tukey post hoc, p < .01). There
was a main effect of DPI on latency to fall, F(4,
172) = 26.81, p < .0001, as well as a main effect of
group, F(3, 43) = 4.492, p = .0079.
However, by 4 DPI, there were no significant differences between any group
and shams.

Figure 3. rmCHI results in minimal motor behavior deficits 1 DPI that return to
4 DPI. Following 0, 1, 5, or 10 rmCHIs, mice were tested on motor
function using an accelerating rotarod at 1, 4, 10, 21, 28, and 35
DPI and on the horizontal ladder beam at 28 DPI (a). rmCHI resulted
in rotarod performance deficits (two-way ANOVA, interaction,
**p = .0080) such that mice with 10 hits fell
quicker off the rotarod at 1 DPI compared with sham controls (Tukey
post hoc, p < .01). No other time points of
rotarod testing had significant differences between groups. Indeed,
a learning effect is evidenced in the upward slop of all groups. (b)
rmCHI had no effect on motor performance on the horizontal ladder
beam as assessed by total forepaw misses over three trials (one-way
ANOVA), F(3, 41) = 1.945,
p = .1375.

rmCHI = repeated mild closed head injury; DPI = days postinjury;
ANOVA = analysis of variance.

One-, 5-, and 10-hit mice also underwent testing on the horizontal ladder
beam at 1 MPI to assess motor function and control. There were no
significant effects of group on number of forepaw misses (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 41) = 1.945, p = .1375; Figure 3(b), as
assessed by total number of forepaw foot faults or misses over three trials
along beam rungs. Taken together, rotarod and ladder beam results suggest
that group differences at 1 month or greater are not the result of
CHI-induced chronic motor deficits.

Anxiety-like behavior and risk-taking were assessed using the EPM task at 1
month postinjury. There was a significant effect of group on time spent in
open arms (one-way ANOVA), F(3, 42) = 8.301,
p = .0001; Figure 4(a). Specifically, 10-hit
mice spent more time in open arms compared with both sham and 1-hit groups
(Tukey post hoc, p < .01). Five-hit mice also spent
significantly more time in open arms compared with sham and 1-hit mice
(Tukey post hoc, p < .05). There was a significant
effect of group on total distance traveled during the task (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 42) = 6.800, p = .0008; Figure 4(b).
Specifically, 10-hit mice traveled more compared with both sham and 1-hit
groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .01 and
p < .05, respectively). Five-hit mice also traveled more
compared with sham and 1-hit mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .05). Moreover, there was a significant effect of
group on number of entries into open arms (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 43) = 9.327, p < .0001; Figure 4(c).
Specifically, 10-hit mice had more entries into open arms compared with both
sham and 1-hit groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .01).
Five-hit mice also had more entries into open arms compared with sham and
1-hit mice (Tukey post hoc, p < .01). There was no
significant effect of group on number of closed arm entries,
F(3, 41) = 0.3840, p = .7651; data not
shown. In addition to the raw numbers of greater time spent in open arms, we
also observed that 5-hit and 10-hit animals would frequently extend their
bodies out into open space beyond the sides of the open arms, whereas shams
and 1-hit animals rarely if ever extended their bodies out over the sides of
the maze. Depression-like behavior was assessed using the TST at 1 month
postinjury. There was no significant difference between any group on time
immobile during the task (one-way ANOVA), F(3, 43) = 2.350,
p = .0857; data not shown.

Figure 4. rmCHI alters cognitive function at 1 and 2 months postinjury.
Following 0, 1, 5, or 10 rmCHIs, mice were tested on the elevated
plus maze at 28 DPI (1 month) and the Morris water maze at 56 DPI (2
months). (a) rmCHI resulted in changes to performance on the
elevated plus maze. Mice with 5 or 10 hits spent more time in the
open arms compared with sham or 1-hit mice (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 42) = 8.301, p = .0002,
and (b) rmCHI mice also traveled more distance during the task
(one-way ANOVA), F(3, 42) = 6.800,
p = .0008, demonstrating hyperactivity and no
prolonged motor deficits. (c) In addition, mice with 5 or 10 hits
exhibited more open arm entries than sham or 1-hit mice (one-way
ANOVA), F(3, 42) = 9.327,
p < .0001. (d) 2 months postinjury, mice were
tested over 5 days on the Morris water maze. rmCHI mice that
received either 5 or 10 hits were impaired in the ability to learn
the location of the hidden platform (two-way ANOVA),
F(12, 172) = 1.943, p = .0324
interaction. The p values on graphs represent Tukey
post hoc differences.

rmCHI = repeated mild closed head injury; DPI = days postinjury;
ANOVA = analysis of variance.

Finally, during initial comparison of rmCHI parameters, 1-, 5-, and 10-hit
mice were tested on the MWM at 2 MPI to assess learning and memory. There
was a significant interaction between group and latency to find the platform
over 5 days of testing (two-way repeated measures ANOVA),
F(12, 172) = 1.943, p = .0324; Figure 4(d). There was
a main effect of time on time to reach platform, F(4,
172) = 17.42, p < .0001, as well as a main effect of
group, F(3, 43) = 7.778, p = .0003. Mice
receiving 10 hits exhibited a significantly longer latency to reach the
platform on testing Day 4 compared with 1-hit mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01) and on Day 5 compared with 1-hit
(p < .001) and sham (p < .05)
mice. Mice receiving 5 hits exhibited a significantly longer latency to
reach the platform on testing Day 4 compared with 1-hit mice
(p < .05) and on testing Day 5 compared with 1-hit
mice (p < .01). On Day 6, a probe trial was completed
without the platform in the tank (not shown). There was a significant effect
of group on this probe task (one-way ANOVA), F(3,
43) = 5.898, p = .0018, where 10-hit mice spent less time
in the target quadrant than 1-hit mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01), and 5-hit mice spent less time in the target
quadrant compared with 1-hit (Tukey post hoc, p < .01)
and sham mice (Tukey post hoc, p < .05). There were no
observed differences in swim speed between any groups, suggesting that there
were no prolonged motor deficits that could account for group
differences.

Quantification of pathology over injury severity at 2 MPI
Immunocytochemistry for myelin basic protein demonstrated that there were
clear differences in corpus callosum thickness in response to rmCHI across
injury severities (Figure
5(a)). To assess white matter integrity, volumetric analysis was
performed using a Cavalieri probe (Figure 5(b)). There was a significant
effect of injury condition on corpus callosum volume (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 20) = 23.35, p < .0001. Mice
that received 10 hits and 5 hits had a significantly smaller corpora callosa
compared with both sham and 1-hit mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .001 for all comparisons, Figure 5(c)). Specifically, 10-hit
animals had 31% thinner corpora callosa than shams on average.
Three-dimensional reconstructions were made using StereoInvestigator
software to better visualize shape and size of the corpus callosum (Figure 5(d) and
Supplemental Movie), where noticeable atrophy, especially in the splenium of
the corpus callosum, was observed.

Figure 5. Mice experiencing rmCHI have significant white matter damage and 31%
atrophy of corpus callosum at 2 months postinjury. (a) Following 5
or 10 hits, mice developed white matter abnormalities and corpus
callosum atrophy; immunocytochemistry for myelin basic protein
(brown), black arrows denote corpus callosum thinning, scale bar = 1
mm. (b) Using principles of unbiased design-based stereology,
corpora callosa volumes were estimated using a Cavalieri probe.
Contours tracing the corpus callosum following cresyl violet
staining (red dotted line) were made throughout the mouse brain at
sections where corpus callosum was intact between the two
hemispheres, scale bar = 1 mm. Sampling was conducted in a 1 in 12
series. (c) At 2 MPI, mice with rmCHI had a 31% reduction in corpus
callosum volume compared with both sham and single hit groups
(one-way ANOVA), F(3, 20) = 23.35,
p < .0001. (d) Three-dimensional
reconstructions of representative animals illustrate atrophy,
especially in the posterior regions of the corpus callosum. (e)
Corpus callosum volume negatively correlates with both elevated plus
maze time in open arm (r = −.633,
p = .0005), as well as (f) latency to reach
platform on Day 5 of Morris water maze testing (r=
−.438, p = .0161).

rmCHI = repeated mild closed head injury; DPI = days postinjury;
MPI = months postinjury; ANOVA = analysis of variance.

There were several relationships between corpus callosum volume and
performance on behavioral tasks. Corpus callosum volume was negatively
correlated with several measures on the EPM at 1 month postinjury: time
spent in open arms (Pearson correlation,
r2 = .400, p = .0009, Figure 5(e)); distance
traveled (r2 = .406, p = .008);
and open arm entries (r2 = .306,
p = .005). Corpus callosum volume was also negatively
correlated with Day 5 latency to platform in the MWM task
(r2 = .192, p = .0322,
Figure 5(f)) and
probe platform crossings (r2 = .185,
p = .036).

Neuronal loss within the cortex below the impact site was suggested by cresyl
violet and NeuN immunocytochemistry for an antigen present within the nuclei
of neurons (Figure
6(a)). To assess neuronal loss following rmCHI, an optical
fractionator was employed to quantify NeuN+ neurons in the cortex
bounded by anatomical landmarks (Figure 6(b)). There was a significant
effect of group on NeuN+ cortical neurons (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 20) = 5.693, p = .0055; Figure 6(c).
Specifically, 10-hit mice had significantly less NeuN+ neurons
compared with both sham and 1-hit groups (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01 and p < .05, respectively).
NeuN+ neurons were reduced 25% in comparison with controls at
2 MPI. Using a Cavalieri probe to quantify cortical volume, a significant
effect of group on cortical volume was also observed (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 20) = 9.514, p = .0004; data not
shown. Ten-hit mice had smaller cortical volume compared with both sham and
1-hit controls (Tukey post hoc, p < .01). Similarly,
five-hit mice had smaller cortical volumes compared with both sham and
one-hit mice (Tukey post hoc, p < .01 and
p < .05, respectively). Normalizing neuronal count
to cortical volume reveals no significant effect of group on
NeuN+ neurons per mm3 (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 20) = 2.384, p = .0996.
NeuN+ neuronal count was negatively correlated with time
spent in open arms during the EPM task at 1 month postinjury (Pearson
correlation, r2 = .2779,
p = .0041, Figure 6(d)) and also latency to platform on Day 5 of MWM
testing at 2 MPI (r2 = .2595,
p = .0055, Figure 6(e)).

Figure 6. rmCHI leads to neuronal loss in the cortex, negatively correlating
with behavioral function. NeuN+ neuronal cell populations
were estimated using principles of stereology. (a) Representative
micrographs of NeuN+ staining from mice with 0, 1, 5, or
10 hits at 2 MPI (scale bar = 1 mm). (b) NeuN+ cells were
quantified in cortex as defined by set borders. Within each
hemisphere, a medial border was drawn at the apex of the cingulate
gyrus of the corpus callosum (green line), and a ventral border was
drawn at the apex of the thalamus (red line, scale bar = 1 mm).
NeuN+ neurons were counted in the cortex bound by
defined borders, as well as the corpus callosum. (c) At 2 MPI, there
were less NeuN+ neurons in the cortex of 10-hit mice
compared with both sham and 1-hit mice (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 20) = 5.693, p = .0055.
(d) NeuN+ cortical neurons negatively correlate with both
elevated plus maze time in open arm (r = −.527,
p = .0041), as well as (e) latency to reach
platform on Day 5 of Morris water maze testing
(r = −.509, p = .0055).

Are Behavioral Deficits Sustained 1, 2, and 6 MPI?
In a separate cohort of mice, anxiety and risk-taking behavior was assessed on
the EPM at 1 MPI and at 6 MPI. There was a significant effect of group on time
spent in open arms (one-way ANOVA), F(2, 25) = 18.31,
p < .0001; Figure 7(a), at 1 MPI. Specifically,
10-hit mice spent more time in open arms compared with both sham and 1 hit
groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .0001). Moreover, there was a
significant effect of group on number of entries into open arms (one-way ANOVA),
F(2, 25) = 6.218, p = .0064. Specifically,
10-hit mice had more entries into open arms compared with both sham and 1-hit
groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .05 and
p < .01, respectively). There was also a significant effect
of group on number of closed arm entries, F(2, 25) = 4.202,
p = .0267. Ten-hit mice had fewer entries into closed arms
compared with sham mice (Tukey post hoc, p < .05). There was
no significant effect of group on total distance traveled during the task
(one-way ANOVA), F(2, 25) = 1.932, p = .1658;
Figure 7(b).

Figure 7. Sustained deficits in behavioral function and white matter atrophy
persist up to 6 months postinjury. (a) Mice with rmCHI spent more time
in open arms of the elevated plus maze at both 1 (one-way ANOVA),
F(2, 25) = 18.31, p < .0001,
and 6 MPI (one-way ANOVA), F(2, 19) = 9.960,
p = .0011. (b) Mice with rmCHI were more active in
the elevated plus maze at 6 MPI, but not at 1 MPI (6 MPI; one-way
ANOVA), F(2, 19) = 10.26, p = .0010.
(c) At 6 MPI, but not at 2 MPI, rmCHI mice spent less time not moving in
the forced swim test compared with both 0- and 1-hit groups (one-way
ANOVA), F(2, 19) = 15.62,
p < .0001. (d) At both 2 MPI and 6 MPI, mice with
rmCHI spent more time classified as “high mobility”: 2 MPI, one-way
ANOVA, F(2, 25) = 3.542, p < .0442;
6 MPI, one-way ANOVA, F(2, 17) = 15.21,
p = .0002. (e) Mice with 10 hits were unable to
learn the location of the hidden platform in the Morris water maze at 6
MPI (two-way ANOVA), F(8, 76) = 2.858,
p < .0078. (f) Mice with 10 hits had significant
white matter atrophy compared with both sham and 1-hit mice (one-way
ANOVA), F(2, 15) = 2.532, p < .01,
and (g) corpus callosum volume measured at 6 MPI negatively correlated
with latency to time in open arms during the elevated plus maze at 2 MPI
(r= −.78, p = .0001). (h) Corpus
callosum volume also negatively correlated with MWM Day 5 latency to
find the platform at 6 MPI (r= −.674,
p = .0011).

rmCHI = repeated mild closed head injury; MPI = months postinjury;
ANOVA = analysis of variance; MWM = Morris water maze.

At 6 MPI, there was still a significant effect of group on time spent in open
arms (one-way ANOVA), F(2, 19) = 9.960,
p = .0011; Figure 7(a). Ten-hit mice spent more time in open arms compared with
both sham and 1-hit groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .01). The
significant effect of group on number of entries into open arms remained
(one-way ANOVA), F(2, 18) = 26.48,
p < .0001. Specifically, 10-hit mice had more entries into
open arms compared with both sham and 1-hit groups (Tukey post hoc,
p < .001 and p < .0001,
respectively). However, there was no effect of group on number of closed arm
entries, F(2, 19) = 0.2867, p = .7539. In
contrast to observations at 1 MPI, there was a significant effect of group on
total distance traveled during the task (one-way ANOVA), F(2,
19) = 10.26, p = .0010; Figure 7(b). Specifically, 10-hit mice
traveled more during the task compared with both sham and 1-hit groups (Tukey
post hoc, p < .01).

Mice were also tested on the FST to assess depressive-like behavior at 2 MPI and
6 MPI. There were no significant effects of group on time not moving (one-way
ANOVA), F(2, 25) = 2.107, p = .1426, Figure 7(c);
‘immobile' time (one-way ANOVA), F(2,
25) = 3.375, p < .0504; or ‘mobile' time
(one-way ANOVA), F(2, 25) = 2.114, p = .1418,
at 2 MPI. However, there was a significant effect of group on ‘high
mobility' time (one-way ANOVA), F(2, 25) = 3.542,
p = .0442; Figure 7(d), where 10-hit mice spent more time classified as
'high mobility' compared with sham mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .05) at 2 MPI. In contrast to the 2 MPI data, at 6
MPI, a significant effect of group on time not moving (one-way ANOVA),
F(2, 19) = 15.62, p < .0001; Figure 7(c), was observed,
where 10-hit mice spent less time ‘not moving' than both sham
and 1-hit groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .001). There was a
significant effect of group on 'immobile' time (one-way ANOVA),
F(2, 19) = 24.01, p < .0001, where
10-hit mice spent less time ‘immobile' than both sham and 1-hit
groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .0001). A significant effect of
group on ‘mobile' time (one-way ANOVA), F(2,
19) = 19.76, p < .0001, where 10-hit mice spent more time
‘mobile' than both sham and 1 hit groups (Tukey post hoc,
p < .0001) was also observed. Finally, there remained a
significant effect of group on ‘high mobility' time (one-way
ANOVA), F(2, 17) = 15.21, p = .0002; Figure 7(d), at 6 MPI,
where 10-hit mice spent more time ‘high mobility' than either
sham or 1-hit groups (Tukey post hoc, p < .01 and
p < .001, respectively).

Mice were tested on the MWM task at 6 MPI to assess long-term effects of injury
on learning and memory. There was a significant interaction between group and
latency to find the platform over 5 days of testing (two-way repeated measures
ANOVA), F(8, 76) = 2.858, p = .0078; Figure 7(e). There was a
main effect of time on time to reach platform, F(4,
76) = 25.27, p < .0001, as well as a main effect of group,
F(2, 19) = 5.264, p = .0152. Mice
receiving 10 hits had significantly longer latency to reach platform on testing
Day 3 compared with sham mice (Tukey post hoc, p < .01), on
testing Day 4 compared with sham (p < .05) and 1-hit
(p < .01) mice, and on Day 5 compared with both sham and
1-hit mice (p < .01). During the probe trial, mice with 10
hits spent less time in the target quadrant than both sham and 1-hit animals
(one-way ANOVA), F(2, 18) = 8.085,
p < .0031, Tukey post hoc, p < .01.

Are Pathological Changes Persistent Out to 6 MPI?
To assess white matter integrity, volumetric analysis was performed using a
Cavalieri probe. There was a significant effect of injury condition on corpus
callosum volume (one-way ANOVA), F(2, 15) = 9.617,
p = .0021; Figure 7(f), at 6 MPI. Mice that received 10 hits had significantly
smaller corpora callosa compared with both sham and 1-hit mice (Tukey post hoc,
p < .01, p <.05); the average
corpora callosa volume was reduced 35% compared with shams. Corpus callosum
volume negatively correlated with latency to time in open arms on the EPM at 6
MPI (r2 = .6083, p = .0001, Figure 7(g)). Corpus
callosum volume also correlated with MWM Day 5 latency to find the platform at 6
MPI (r2 = .4540, p = .0022, Figure 7(h)).

Stereological quantification of NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursors in the
corpus callosum of injured and uninjured mice was also performed. There was no
significant effect of absolute number of NG2+ cells between groups
(one-way ANOVA), F(2, 15)=1.012, p = .3871;
however, there was a strong correlation between NG2+ cells and corpus
callosum volume at 6 MPI (r2 = .5781,
p = .0002), whereby there were more NG2+ cells
in larger corpora collosa. CE values for sham, 1-hit, and
10-hit groups averaged 0.13, 0.17, and 0.16, respectively.

Following rmCHI, and as reported by numerous groups, extensive glial activation
and inflammation were observed at both 2 MPI (from the injury severity cohorts)
and 6 MPI (from the long-term cohorts). Specifically, hypertrophic
GFAP+ astrocytes (Figure 8) and activated Iba1+
microglia (Figure 9)
were observed in 10-hit animals, particularly localized to corpus callosum
tracts in comparison with sham and 1-hit animals.

Differences Between NSG and C57Bl/6J Mice
We tested the effect of rmCHI on a newly developed mouse strain from Jackson
Laboratories, NSG (catalog #005557), to lay the groundwork for future testing of
cellular therapies. Surprisingly, NSG mice exhibited no significant changes as a
result of any injury parameter tested on any behavioral or histological measure
assessed in comparison with NSG sham controls. NSG mice were tested on the EPM
at 1 MPI. There were no differences between groups. Specifically, there was no
effect of group on time spent in open arms (Figure 10(a), one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 43)=1.302, p = .2865, on distance
traveled (Figure 10(b),
one-way ANOVA), F(3, 43) = 0.5475,
p = .6525, or open arm entries (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 43) = .9388, p = .4302, at 1 MPI.
Mice were also tested for learning performance at 2 MPI on the MWM. There were
no differences detected in performance between groups (Figure 10(c), two-way repeated measures
ANOVA), F(12, 172)=0.4904, p = .9184.
Moreover, the white matter atrophy we observed in C57Bl/6J mice was not observed
in NSG mice at 6 MPI at any injury level (Figure 10(d), one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 19) = 0.5767, p = .6573. A summary of
the effects of rmCHI on a range of behavioral assessments at different time
points is shown in Table
1 for both C57Bl/6J and NSG mice. A summary of correlations between
corpus callosum volume and NeuN number versus several behavioral endpoints is
provided in Table

atrophy was not observed at 6 MPI in NSG mice receiving any level of

in C57Bl/6J mice, there appeared to be reduced staining for GFAP (d) and
Iba1 (e) in NSG mice following rmCHI. NSG mice were treated and stained
identical to those shown in Figures 8 and 9, although not in
parallel with the staining of C57Bl/6J mice.

Exacerbation of Tau Phosphorylation in hTau Mice Following rmCHI
We were unable to assess hTau mice for behavioral changes as the group sizes were
too small and hTau mice are difficult to test accurately due to hyperactivity.
Instead, we compared the level of pTau (CP13 and PHF-1) in the hippocampus of
sham-treated and rmCHI-challenged hTau mice in response to the 5-hit model using
immunocytochemistry. We observed that 10-month-old female hTau mice exhibit
increased staining of pTau (CP13) 6 months post-rmCHI (Figure 11(a) and (b)); PHF-1 staining
was also present (data not shown). Increases in hyperphosphorylated tau were
most robust within the granule cell layer and apical dendrites of the dentate
gyrus. We observed similar increases in CP13 immunostaining in male hTau mice in
response to the 5-hit rmCHI injuries. Conversely, no CP13 or PHF-1 staining was
seen in WT mice regardless of injury status or gender (data not shown).

Figure 11. Transgenic hTau mice show rmCHI induced increases in phosphorylated tau
following within the hippocampus. Immunohistochemical analysis of (a)
sham and (b) 5-hit rmCHI 10-month-old female hTau mice show increased
staining of phosphorylated tau (CP13) 6 MPI. A majority of the increase
was observed within the granule cell layer and apical dendrites of the
dentate gyrus (a', b'). Male hTau mice exhibited a similar response to
injury, whereas no CP13 staining was seen in wild-type (WT) mice
regardless of injury status or gender (data not shown). (c and d) An
ANOVA of Western blot protein levels demonstrated that phosphorylated
tau (PHF-1) levels were significantly elevated in hTau mice compared
with WT mice 3 months after the rmCHI (one-way ANOVA),
F(3, 15) = 995.1, p < .001,
post hoc Tukey’s p ≤ .0002 between sham and rmCHI hTau
mice. Scale bars = 200 μm.

rmCHI = repeated mild closed head injury; MPI = months postinjury;
ANOVA = analysis of variance; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate

On Western blots (Figure 11(c)
and (d)), total tau levels (HT7) were unchanged in WT mice after
rmCHI exposure (1.45 ± 0.075 in sham-treated vs. 1.48 ± 0.045 in rmCHI animals).
In hTau mice, total tau levels (HT7) were slightly increased, though not
significantly (2.20 ± 0.194 vs. 2.41 ± 0.17) after rmCHI. Levels of tau
phosphorylated at Thr231/Ser235 tau (AT8) were slightly increased both in WT
(1.06 ± 0.054 vs. 1.13 ± 0.068) and in hTau mice (1.75 ± 0.0116 vs.
1.94 ± 0.108) after rmCHI. There were slight conformational changes in tau
toward tangle formation (via MC1) in both WT (0.888 ± 0.114 vs. 0.947 ± 0.104)
and in hTau mice (2.40 ± 0.105 vs. 2.55 ± 0.14) 3 months after rmCHI. pTau at
Ser202 (CP13) was detected only in hTau mice and was increased after rmCHI
(0.626 ± 0.144 vs. 0.833 ± 0.076). Hyperphosphorylated tau at Ser396/Ser404
(PHF-1) was also detected only in hTau mice and was significantly increased
after rmCHI in comparison with shams (0.789 ± 0.0242 vs. 0.915 ± 0.027,
p < .0002). These data suggest that hTau mice with rmCHI
may be suitable to model CTE.

Discussion
rmTBI Is Not ‘One' Syndrome
TBI is often used to describe head injuries encompassing a wide range of
precipitating events, followed by a wide range of cognitive and pathological
consequences. To better study this variety, many experimental animal models have
been developed to recapitulate specific consequences of head injuries, depending
on the model chosen. While it may seem ideal to have one universal rodent model
to facilitate comparisons across research groups, it is impossible to account
for every injury type or every injury sequelae due to the variability of
injuries, so standardizing to one model would be severely restricting. It is
therefore useful to have multiple models of TBI and rmCHI that have their own
characteristics relevant to a specific clinical injury phenotype—provided those
models have been well characterized and recapitulate specific features of the
human condition. We chose to combine a well-controlled cortical impact (CCI)
model with a freely moving head so that rotational/axon shearing forces were
combined with CCI. Our goal was to replicate chronic symptoms
and pathologies clinically similar to that of patients with rmCHI and to look
for correlations between behavioral function and measures of pathology as a
result of rmCHI. Our model induces long-term cognitive deficits, white matter
atrophy, cortical neuronal loss, demyelination, and chronic neuroinflammation,
particularly within the corpus callosum. This model uses commercially available
equipment allowing for replication across laboratories. Avoiding use of a fixed
head stereotaxic position allows for rotational forces in the anterior–posterior
axis and coup–contrecoup intracranial impacts. Another benefit is the reduced
time under anesthesia (7 min), minimizing confounding neuroprotective effects of
isoflurane (Statler et al., 2000,
2006). This short procedure allows for high-throughput and large
animal cohorts, useful when assessing behavior. An experienced solo experimenter
could run this procedure on 10 mice per hour. In addition, there is low
variability within groups and high reproducibility across users.

Long-Term Cognitive and Behavioral Deficits Following rmCHI
Clinically, head injuries can result in a range of symptoms. Patients with a
history of TBI frequently develop depression (33%) with comorbidities including
anxiety (77%) and aggressive behavior (57%; Jorge et al., 2004), as well as
deficits in working memory (Collins et al., 1999a,
1999b; Iverson
et al., 2006). In the rmCHI model presented here, we recapitulate
these behavioral deficits following repeated injury; mice receiving a single
impact at the standardized injury parameters (5 m/s and 1 mm depth) do not
display detectable behavioral changes, whereas 3- and 5-hit mice do, supporting
the argument that repeated injuries of a mild severity can lead
to impairments as the result of cumulative effects. When tested on the MWM, mice
receiving either 5 or 10 hits took longer to find a hidden platform over 5 days
of testing at both 2 and 6 MPI, whereas mice receiving a single hit were able to
learn the task. Learning the water maze task is a dorsal hippocampus-mediated
task (Moser et al.,
1993). Although no gross hippocampal changes were observed in
C57Bl/6J mice, hippocampal neuron counts or synapse quantification could provide
more insight for the role of these learning deficits following rmCHI. Supporting
the possibility of discrete hippocampal changes, we observed focal hippocampal
increases in hyperphosphorylated tau 3 MPI in hTau mice, suggesting this model
can induce hippocampal changes that may affect cognition.

Deficits in learning at chronic time points post-rmCHI have been reported for the
MWM (Meehan et al.,
2012; Mannix
et al., 2013). Using a weight drop model of rmCHI, mice with 5 daily
or 5 weekly, but not 5 monthly, head impacts had deficits in the MWM (Mannix et al., 2013).
Moreover, this study also observed deficits in the task persisting up to 1 year
post-injury. In a modified CCI mCHI injury, where animals received 2 impacts
over 2 days, deficits in learning were observed at 7 weeks post-injury (Shitaka et al., 2011).
However, neither of these studies correlated water maze performance with
associated neuropathologies. We observed that both corpus callosum atrophy and
loss of cortical NeuN+ neurons correlated with performance on the
MWM. Models of rmCHI with long-lasting deficits are critical for future
intervention studies and for understanding CTE. Importantly, we did not see an
exacerbation of deficits (behavioral or pathological) in the 10-hit animals
compared with 5-hit animals, nor significant differences between animals that
received 5 hits over 5 days versus 5 hits over 10 days, suggesting a threshold
or ceiling for cumulative effects at one injury every other day. Reducing the
injuries to 3 hits over 6 days in comparison with 5 hits does not change the
distance traveled in the EPM but results in an intermediate effect on the time
in open arms. Both 3-hit and 5-hit mice have similar deficits in learning on the
MWM. In a fixed skull open scalp rmTBI model, Bolton Hall et al. (2016) reported that
mice receiving 5 hits spaced 48 hr apart did not differ significantly from mice
receiving 5 hits 24 hr apart, supporting the timing of a ceiling effect.

An animal spending more time in closed arms on the EPM is typically considered to
have elevated anxiety (Lister, 1987), whereas the extent of movement versus
immobility on the FST is considered a surrogate for depression (Petit-Demouliere
et al., 2005). However, more time spent in open arms can also be indicative of
increased risk-taking behavior. At both 1 MPI and 6 MPI, mice receiving rmCHI
displayed significant changes in both anxiety and depression-linked behavioral
tasks; in contrast, mice with a signal hit exhibited no detectable deficits. On
the EPM, mice with rmCHI were hyperactive, spent more time in open arms, and had
more open arm entries. rmCHI mice also traveled greater distances in the EPM
compared with shams. Five-hit and 10-hit mice frequently extended their bodies
out into open space beyond the sides of arms, whereas shams and 1-hit mice
rarely, if ever, extended their bodies out over the sides of the maze. This
suggest an overall hyperactive state as well as a varied or greater risk-taking
profile (e.g., based on risk assessment, decision-making, exploration, and
vertical activity; Rodgers and Johnson, 1995). Common long-term sequelae of
people with TBI are disinhibition and aggression (Arciniegas and Wortzel, 2014).
In support of this possibility, we also observed a hyperactive state in the FST
at 2 and 6 MPI (Figure 7). Opposite to the predicted depressive-like behavior of
more immobile time, rmCHI mice displayed more moving time as well more
‘highly mobile' time. These mice responded more
aggressively to the task and tried to escape the test more than uninjured or
single hit animals. While counterintuitive, viewed from the perspective of
emotional ‘dyscontrol' common in individuals with TBI, the
phenotype we observed in our model has external validity and argues for more
thorough testing of emotional and behavioral changes in mice post-rmCHI in
addition to standard learning and memory tasks.

Similar changes in anxiety-like behavior on the EPM has also been reported at
chronic time points of 1 and 6 months following rmCHI (Petraglia et al., 2014) where animals
spent significantly more time in open arms (as observed here); however, to our
knowledge, no data on hyperactivity following rmCHI on this test have been
previously reported. In our model, rmCHI mice were indistinguishable from shams
on the tail suspension task, whereas Bajwa et al. (2016) reported that rmCHI
mice and CCI injured mice become immobile more quickly than sham animals; we did
not specifically measure the 'time to immobile' to be able to
make a clearer comparison. Chronic time points assessed at greater than 1 MPI
are vital to investigating disease progression and detecting sustained or
increased deficits over time (Gold et al., 2013). Interestingly, a
slight progression of behavioral deficits was observed in the retest of the FST
at 6 MPI versus 2 MPI, whereas deficits in performance on the EPM and MWM
remained constant to 6 MPI. Discovery of behavioral measures that show disease
progression over time could be valuable in linking cognitive changes and with
neuropathological progression.

Long-Term Neuropathological Findings Post-rmCHI
Animals receiving rmCHI exhibited significant white matter atrophy of the corpus
callosum. Atrophy was observed as early as 2 month post-injury (the earliest
timepoint measured) and remained 6 months following injury. White matter volume
loss was associated with demyelination as well as chronic astroglial
neuroinflammation and reactive microglia. In addition, we observed significant
cortical neuronal loss following rmCHI. Loss of neurons was associated with
cortical volume loss, while no changes in neuronal density were observed.
Chronic neuroinflammation at both 6 and 12 MPI has been previously reported in
other experimental models of rmCHI (Shitaka et al., 2011; Mouzon et al., 2012).
One might hypothesize that cortical neurons projecting through the corpus
callosum have become demyelinated, or the neurons and axonal projections through
the corpus callosum have died. Importantly, we observed cortical neuronal loss
in areas sending contralateral projections. Demyelination can occur due to
several injury mechanisms. Upon oligodendrocyte death, oligodendrocyte
progenitor cell (OPC) populations migrate to the site, divide, and differentiate
into newborn oligodendrocytes capable of repopulating lesions and subsequently
remyelinating axons (Kirby et al., 2006; Franklin and Ffrench-Constant, 2008).
Mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes could be selectively more susceptible to
physical trauma or fail to remyelinate disrupted or demyelinated axons. Another
possibility is a dysfunction of OPC populations. OPCs are evenly distributed
throughout the brain, including the corpus callosum. rmCHI could lead to failure
of OPC migration to injury sites, or impairment in cell division and
differentiation. NG2+ oligodendrocytes have been shown to proliferate
up to 7 days post-TBI in an experimental rodent model, but proliferation
subsides by 21 DPI (Flygt et al., 2017). Seeing as much of the observed
inflammation was occurring within the white matter tracts in the current model,
we attempted to clarify the interplay between white matter degeneration and
neuronal loss. We quantified the number of NG2+ OPCs in the corpus
callosum, as these cells have been shown to proliferate between 7 and 21 days
post-TBI, but no quantification has been performed at more chronic time points.
At 6 MPI, we found that the overall density of NG2+ cells relative to
volume remains constant, suggesting that the damage occurring in white matter
following this experimental model of rmCHI is not due to a lack of
oligodendrocyte progenitors and remyelination potential. To further elucidate
the targets of the observed neuroinflammation, future studies should focus on
quantification and assessment of a variety of cell subpopulations, including
both immature and mature oligodendrocytes, as well as cortical layer segmented
analysis.

Linking Neuropathology to Behavioral Changes
The corpus callosum is the major thoroughfare for cortical neuronal commiserate
fibers between hemispheres. While it has been demonstrated that even a single
TBI can lead to a 25% reduction in white matter in humans (Johnson et al.,
2013a), the link between white matter disruption and cognitive/emotional
impairments has yet to be clearly elucidated. This relationship has been
investigated in clinical studies focusing on associations between
diffusion-tensor imaging, particularly in white matter tracts, with emotional
and cognitive changes following TBI (Kraus et al., 2007; Cubon et al., 2011;
Shenton et al., 2012), although a clear relationship has yet to be illuminated.
In addition, inflammation is a consistent feature of neurotrauma (Mckee and
Lukens, 2016). In Rag1(−/−) mice, which lack mature T- and B-cells,
there were no observed differences in injury response or neurological score in
the acute phase of injury (≤ 7 DPI; Weckbach et al., 2012). Further, Weckback
noted that C3a levels were significantly reduced in Rag1(−/−) mice
after CHI in comparison with WT controls. However, these were
Rag1(−/−) mice, not the Rag1(−/−) gamma (interleukin 2
[IL2] receptor common γ chain null) NSG mice used in the present study. In the
present study, C57Bl/6J mice receiving rmCHI exhibited long-term microgliosis in
the hippocampus and corpus callosum. Conversely, NSG exhibited no behavioral
deficits nor atrophy or gliosis within the corpus callosum. Chronic
Iba1+ microglia activation has also been reported in white matter
tracts including corpus callosum, olfactory nerve layer, optic tract, and the
brachium of superior colliculus in the CHIMERA model (Namjoshi et al., 2014)
using C57Bl/6J mice. Chronic microgliosis has also been observed in humans
post-TBI, especially in white matter tracts (Smith et al., 2013).

The contribution of microgliosis to axonal injury has yet to be fully
investigated. Several groups have observed white matter gliosis following
trauma. Chronic Iba1+ reactive microglia have been observed post-TBI
in rodents, especially in white matter tracts following two mild closed head
TBIs (Shitaka et al.,
2011). However, in a mouse model of rmCHI, acute administration of
valganciclovir to CD11b-thymidine kinase transgenic mice depleting macrophages
had no effect on chronic axonal injury (Bennett and Brody, 2014). Low-dose
valganciclovir reduced microglia in the corpus callosum and external capsule by
35% after rmCHI; however, axonal injury was unaltered; higher doses of
valganciclovir or longer exposure were found to be toxic. Dr. Kim Green’s
laboratory previously showed that PLX5622 at 1,200 mg/kg in chow can reduce the
number of microglia in the central nervous system by 80% to 95%, depending on
the duration of drug treatment (Dagher et al., 2015). Moreover, the
brains of mice treated for 14 days at the 1,200 mg/kg dose of PLX5622, when
exposed to lipopolysaccharide (0.5 mg/kg) via IP injection, expressed
significantly less mRNA for IL-1ß (60% less) and tumor necrosis factor-α (70%
less) than mice with a normal population of microglia. The 300 mg/kg
PLX5622-treated animals, which reduced microglia only by 35%, did not attenuate
the IL-1β levels in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. This may explain why Bennett and Brody
(2014), where they reduced microglia by only 35%, did not see any
protection from 2 hits.

Immunodeficient Models and Stem Cell Transplants
Stem cell transplants may be an option for treating the effects of repeated mTBI
if the deficits are severe enough, chronic, and suitable targets for cellular
engraftment result from the injury. One strategy to alleviate these symptoms is
to introduce multipotent neural stem cells that are capable of differentiating
into neurons, oligodendrocytes, or astrocytes. One strategy might be to
introduce neural stem cells to repopulate neuronal loss in the cortex, increase
oligodendrocyte progenitor pools within corpus callosum, or increase
oligodendrocytes and myelination for commissural fibers within the corpus
callosum. Previous studies have shown efficacy of neural stem cell
transplantation in acute models of TBI (Shear et al., 2004; Skardelly et al., 2011;
Ma et al., 2012;
Wang et al.,
2012; Beretta et al.,
2017; Haus
et al., 2016), but this approach has not been investigated in a
rodent model of rmCHI.

It is imperative to test clinically relevant cell populations, that is, human as
opposed to murine cells. However, testing human stem cells in a rodent requires
either multiple immunosuppressive agents or the use of immunodeficient animals
(Anderson et al.,
2011) to prevent rejection. Without the knowledge that white matter
deficits are significant and sustained following rmCHI, targeting this syndrome
with a cell therapy would seem premature. We chose a newly developed mouse from
Jackson laboratories, NSG mice (catalog # 005557), which are similar to the
classic immunocompromised mouse line, NOD-scids; both lack T
and B cells. In addition, NSG mice carry a null allele of the IL2 receptor
gamma, resulting in a deficiency of natural killer cells, antigen presenting
cells, complement, and IL2 receptor gamma chain, while also having a longer life
span than NOD-scids, making them even more attractive for
long-term survival studies following cell transplantation. However, the finding
that NSG mice exhibited neither behavioral nor frank pathological consequences
following rmCHI, while suggesting that the inflammatory response to rmCHI is a
significant component, indicates that testing a cell therapy in NSG mice at this
time would be ill-advised.

Summary
There are shortcomings of any model and experiment, the present study included. For
example, we do not know what the minimum delay between injuries is such that
pathological or cognitive deficits are observed after 3, 5, or 10 hits, but not
after 1 hit. In addition to different timing, different velocities and depth of
impact should also be compared. Furthermore, the observation that 5 hits delivered
every other day versus 5 days in a row both result in similar findings suggests that
there is a ceiling effect of the injury paradigm. Finally, a more precise threshold
for impactor velocity, depth of injury, and timing between injuries of injury
severity would better classify the injury as mild,
moderate, or severe and allow others to
calibrate the level of injury to different paradigms. We would argue that any
combination of parameters that results in undetectable functional or pathological
consequences is by definition mild. In the present study, 5 and 10
impacts at 5.0 m/s speed and 1 mm depth of impact were sufficient to produce both
behavioral and pathological deficits that were correlated with each other.

In humans, acute trauma results in one set of repercussions and secondary
degeneration. But we are now learning that the consequences of concussion, and
particularly repeated or multiple concussions, such as those sustained by athletes
in a wide range of sports, or individuals in the military who are exposed to
improvised explosive devices, concussive forces from shoulder fired missiles,
grenades, or mortars, have their own sequelae of repercussions, leading to increased
risk of developing CTE. Animal models that can mirror more facets of CTE, such as
the use of hTau mice reported here, will enable us to explore the potential to block
degenerative pathways or enhance regeneration post-concussion. This study lays the
groundwork for further exploring the link between rmCHI, neuroinflammation, and the
association of discrete neuropathological features with cognitive and emotional
alterations.

Summary Statement
Mice with repeated mild concussions, but not a single concussion, exhibit a variety
of functional deficits 2 and 6 MPI. These deficits are associated with thinning of
the white matter and loss of cortical neurons.
