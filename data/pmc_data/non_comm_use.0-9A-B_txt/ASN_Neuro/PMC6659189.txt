==== Body
Increased attention to the role of glial activities in neural functions and diseases has
drawn the participation of more than 180 experts who engaged in glial cell research to
the 2019 Academic Annual Meeting and the Frontier Seminar on “Glial Cell Function and
Disease” held in Nantong, China from May 24 to 26. The meeting was organized by Drs.
Yong-Jing Gao and Jia-Wei Zhou of the Chinese Society of Neuroscience Glia Branch. The
conference focused on the physiological and pathological functions of astrocytes,
microglia, and oligodendrocytes presented by two plenary lectures and five sections
presented by 25 speakers and others.

The meeting opened with the letters from Drs. Xiong-Li Yang and Shu-Min Duan, Honorary
Chairmen of the Academic Committee, members of Chinese Academy of Sciences, which
briefly reviewed the development of studies on Glial Cells and stated their expectation
that the future of Chinese Brain Research Program would be in the hands of young
generations of neuroscientists.

Plenary Speeches
In the first plenary lecture, Yutian Wang (University of British Columbia, Canada)
began the academic exchanges with “Development of NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
receptor)-positive allosteric modulators as novel therapeutics for brain disorders.”
In this lecture, Dr. Wang systematically reviewed their contribution to the
theoretical development of different subtypes of glutamate NMDAR in synaptic and
extrasynaptic neurotransmissions. Then, he presented that in study on the
involvement of NMDAR in stroke-evoked cell death, his team identified a series of
specific and selective modulators of NMDAR subunits and highlighted the potential of
using GluN2A-NMDAR-positive allosteric potentiators (Npams) to activate pro-survival
signaling and reduce excitotoxic/ischemic neuronal injuries in
vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the protective
effect of Npams was still viable used hours after the initial ischemia/reperfusion
by dually intensifying long-term potentiation and long-term depression (Dalton et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2018). As
extrasynaptic neurotransmissions are closely associated with astrocytic release of
glutamate, their study opens a possibility to alleviate ischemic injury and other
excitotoxic neural diseases, such as Alexander’s disease and schizophrenia through
specifically modulating astrocytic glutamate release.

The second plenary speaker Xia Zhang (University of Ottawa) presented “Mechanisms
underlying cannabinoid regulation of brain function and disease.” Therapeutic usage
of cannabis has a history of more than 5,000 years in China. In recent 20 years,
endogenous cannabis and cannabinoid receptors were also identified. Zhang’s team has
systematically studied the effect of cannabis on reward, memory, sleep, cognition,
anxiety, and depression by using a variety of biotechniques, with specific interest
in cannabinoid receptors that were present in astrocytes and microglia. Dr. Zhang
specifically highlighted a top-down wake circuitry wherein increased activity of the
medial prefrontal cortex could modulate the activity of well-established
sleep-associated neuronal activity in the raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and
ventral tegmental area. This finding has deepened our understanding of the
mechanisms underlying sleep awakening in addition to the long-established ascending
reticular activating system (Zhong et al., 2017).

Microglia and Disease
The first keynote speaker Yu-Qiu Zhang (Fudan University) presented “Involvement of
hippocampal microglia in anxiodepressive-like behaviors induced by chronic pain.”
Dr. Zhang reported that at 14 days after chronic constriction injury of infraorbital
nerve (COIN), both rats and mice exhibited anxiodepressive-like behaviors along with
trigeminal neuralgia and microglia activation in the hippocampus. The results
obtained by combined methods of animal behavioral observation, pharmacology,
electrophysiology, optogenetics, and chemical genetics highlighted that hippocampal
microglial activation mediates CION-induced anxiodepressive-like behaviors in
rodents. This behavioral change was correlated with hippocampal neuroinflammation
mediated by ATP-gated P2X7 receptor-microglia-interleukin-1β and indoleamine
2,3-dioxygenase metabolic pathway (Chen et al., 2019). Subsequently, Yu Zhou
(Qingdao University) presented “Microglia regulates contextual fear memory linking,”
Zhi-Hua Gao (Zhejiang University) presented “Regulation of microglia activity: a
purinergic affair,” and Bo Peng presented “Deciphering the origins of repopulated
microglia in the central nervous system.” The application of modern molecular
biology and imaging techniques in these studies left a very living impression on the
audience.

The last presenter in this section was Yong-Jing Gao (Nantong University) with the
topic of “The association of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT1) regulation
of spinal microglia proliferation after spinal nerve ligation with neuralgia.” In
this model, NFAT1 expression in spinal microglia was found under the regulation of
DNA methylation by Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 and Ca2+/calcineurin.
NFAT1 knockout mice showed less microglia activation and reduced pathologic
neuralgia. The latter effect was simulated by inhibition of microglia proliferation.
These findings provided several potential targets for suppressing neuralgia (Zhang
et al., 2017; Wu
et al., 2019).

Astrocytes and Disease
The section was covered by three speakers led by Jia-Wei Zhou (Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai). To reveal the contribution of astrocytes to neuroinflammation
during the development of Parkinson’s disease, Zhou’s team has studied the role of
Ebf1 (early B cell factor 1) and its downstream effector Rgs5 (regulator of
G-protein signaling 5) in lipopolysaccharide-evoked pro-inflammatory activity around
dopaminergic neurons. The results revealed that Ebf1/Rgs5 signaling axis was a
critical determinant for astrocyte activation in vivo. This result
was very helpful for designing novel therapies targeting the astrocyte-driven
neuroinflammation and associated neurodegenerative diseases (Q. Li et al., 2019).

Jie Zhang (Xiamen University) and Yan Li (Xi’an Jiaotong University) then presented
their talks entitled “Menin (Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) deficiency leads
to depressive behavior by modulating astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation” and “The
reprogramming of astrocytic glycogen metabolism in ischemia-reperfusion injury,”
respectively. The former report was about the signaling process leading to
astrocytic Menin (Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1)-evoked neuroinflammation and
the therapeutic potential of targeting Menin in major depressive disorder. The
latter one revealed that decreased glycogenolysis was responsible for the excessive
glycogen accumulation in astrocytes following ischemia/reperfusion, which reduced
lactate supplement from astrocytes to neurons and caused tricarboxylic acid cycle
disorder, thereby leading to neuronal death. This report also highlighted that
glycogen phosphorylase was a potential intervention target for ischemic stroke.

Glioma Treatment and Glial Imaging
As a critical step for the diagnosis and treatment of glioma, illuminating glioma
cells was highlighted by neurosurgeons and experts of imaging technique development.
Ying Mao (Shanghai Huanshan Hospital) and Wei Shi (Affiliated Hospital of Nantong
University) presented their skills in manipulating glioma in and out of the
operation rooms. Mao emphasized on “The breaking point in individualized diagnosis
and treatment based on the understanding of glioma metabolism.” Surprisingly, based
on the inherent association between isocitrate dehydrogenases mutation and glioma
development, his team could classify the tumor and identify glioma and its margin
within 31 min during the surgery with 100% success. This achievement gave them the
confidence to effectively elongate the life of patients with glioma except Grade IV
(Xu et al., 2019).
Alternatively, Shi focused his studies on “Combination therapy mediated by glioma
dual targeted delivery system constructed by OPPD (Pep22 polypeptide drug delivery
system).” Dr. Shi demonstrated that the OPPD drug-loading system not only targeted
glioma cells that overexpressed low-density lipoprotein receptor but also had dual
therapeutic effect on the tumor by transporting chemotherapeutic drug doxocycline, a
matrix metalloprotease inhibitor, into glioma and by generating thermal effect by
near infrared radiation (Qian et al., 2018).

In association with many brain diseases, studies on the mechanisms underlying
spreading depolarization during neuronal hyperexcitation called upon extensive
attention of the audience. “Enhanced gliotransmission and neural synchrony after
spreading depolarization” presented by Ning Zhou (Shanghai Tech University)
highlighted that astrocyte-originated, NMDAR-dependent slow inward currents driven
by IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) receptor-mediated Ca2+ wave
underlay spreading depolarization and low-frequency synchrony of hippocampal
neurons. This work provided a new target to control stroke, migraine, and other
spreading depolarization-associated neuropathy (Wu et al., 2017).

In this section, the latest advancements in the biotechniques and their applications
in glial studies were also highlighted. Zhao-Fa Wu (Peking University, on behalf of
Yulong Li) and Xiao-Chun Gu presented “Spying on purinergic transmission by
constructing new genetically encoded G-protein coupled receptor activation based
(GRAB) fluorescent sensors” and “Roles of multi-channel optic imaging in
neurovascular coupling study,” respectively. The former presentation showed that the
development of purinergic GRAB sensors provides critical genetically encoded imaging
probes for investigating purinergic transmission with molecular specificity. The
latter exhibited a powerful tool of combining GCaMP (a genetically encoded calcium
sensor) with model microscopic techniques, such as optical coherence tomography and
multiple-wavelength spectroimaging and laser speckle contrast imaging, in studying
the reactive features of astrocytes in the neurovascular unit.

Oligodendrocytes and Disease
Lan Xiao (the Third Military University), Liang Zhang (Xiamen University), Feng Mei
(the Third Military University), and Zeng-Qiang Yuan (Chinese Academy of Sciences)
focused on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of
oligodendrocytes in the myelination and the potential targets promoting
remyelination in disease. They, respectively, presented the “Impacts of
connexin-mediated oligodendro-astrocytic network on oligodendroglia development and
remyelination” (Niu et al.,
2019), “Nucleoporin Seh1-A novel regulator of oligodendrocytes
differentiation and myelination,” “Enhancing oligodendrocyte myelination rescues
synaptic loss and improves functional recovery after chronic hypoxia” (Li et al., 2018), and “A novel
m6A reader Prrc2a controls oligodendroglial specification and
myelination.” Their findings had important reference value in the development of
medicine while unveiling the complex inter- and intra-cellular regulatory processes
in this less explored type of glial cells.

Glial–Neuronal Interactions and Disease
Yang Su (Jinan University) presented “Synergistic toxicity between neurons and
astrocytes in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia 17.” It showed that
synergistic toxicity of mutant TATA (a conserved DNA promoter sequence enriched in
TATAAA)-binding protein in neurons and astrocytes played a critical role in this
ataxia (Yang et al.,
2017). Gang Chen (Nantong University) addressed the “Roles of Schwann cells
in the functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury” and identified
lysosome-associated neuralgia and the signaling process. “Glia in addiction” was the
topic of Tifei Yuan (Shanghai Mental Health Center), and it highlighted the
contribution of glial transmission to the synaptic plasticity in addiction.

The end of the session came with the presentation of “Retinal Muller cell gliosis in
experimental glaucoma” by Zhong-Feng Wang (Fudan University). In a rat glaucomatous
model, Dr. Wang found that increased intraocular pressure changed Kir4.1 currents
and activated Muller cells that released inflammatory cytokines to evoke neuronal
apoptosis (Gao et al.,
2015). The findings based on this readily accessible model for in
vivo studies left a strong impression on the audience and its potential
for treatment of glaucoma was appreciated.

The last talk was delivered by Yu-Feng Wang (Harbin Medical University). Glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a type III intermediate filament and the major
component of astrocytic cytoskeleton. In many degenerative, inflammatory and
traumatic brain diseases, abnormal expression of GFAP has been identified; however,
GFAP was still viewed as a simple maker of astrocytes. To explore the functional
role of GFAP in astrocytic functional plasticity, Wang’s team linked GFAP with other
astrocytic proteins and identified their common spatiotemporal association during
environmental challenges and then put forward a hypothesis of “Elastic retraction
and extension network model” to explain the “guide role” of GFAP in astrocytic
plasticity (Wang & Parpura,
2018). This proposal also triggered the thoughts of many young
investigators on how to create new ideas in the study.

Others
Along with the 25 speakers, more other 10 other scholars also presented their works
in glial studies. In addition, the meeting introduced two prosperous neuroscience
journals, the Neuroscience Bulletin and ASN Neuro,
which provided the participants excellent platforms to publish their works.

Concluding Comments
In the closing ceremony, Jia-Wei Zhou (Chairman of the Chinese Society of
Neuroscience Glia Branch) summarized that the presentations represented the highest
achievements of Chinese scholars on glial cells and promoted the cooperation between
peers. The participants conducted extensive academic exchanges on the latest glial
research and experimental techniques in and out of the meeting and familiarized
themselves with the frontiers of glial studies. He specifically highlighted the
contributions of the younger investigators who constituted roughly 75% of the
attendees. As discoveries of glia in health and disease continue to emerge, members
of the community all look forward to the next meeting that takes place in 2020.
