Objective
 Simulation training is a powerful learning tool for low frequency events. Forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries (FAVD) are an important tool in reducing cesarean deliveries. The aim of this study is to create a high-fidelity simulation-based curriculum for residency education and investigate pre- and posttest skill and confidence.



Methods
 A prospective cohort study was conducted involving obstetrics and gynecology residents over 2 academic years. Residents participated in one to three FAVD simulation trainings. All sessions involved video, didactic, and hands-on practice. Pre- and postsurvey and skills assessment were conducted to assess confidence, ability to consent, and perform a FAVD. Wilcoxon's signed-rank tests and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used.



Results
 Thirty residents (73%) completed at least one forceps simulation training session. Participants demonstrated significant improvement in confidence (
p
 < 0.005) following training. Before the intervention, there was a disparity in confidence by postgraduate level (
p
 < 0.005); however, this difference was not seen postsimulation (
p
 = 0.24). Residents demonstrated significant improvement in their FAVD skills (
p
 < 0.05), as well as their ability to consent (
p
 < 0.01).



Conclusion
 Simulation training improves residents' perceived confidence in FAVD. Simulation helped to better equalize confidence across classes. FAVD simulations improves resident confidence, skill, and more broadly broadened the armamentarium to decrease the cesarean delivery rate.

In 2016, Easter et al evaluated the use of simulation training to improve resident knowledge and comfort regarding twin vaginal births. In their study, obstetrics and gynecology residents complete counseling module, simulation of twin vaginal delivery, and a breech extraction skills station. Participants in simulation demonstrated significant improvement in knowledge and comfort.

and simulation training can be an effective way to begin teaching residents once again how to safely and effectively perform FAVDs. The aim of this study is to create a simulation-based curriculum and analyze resident knowledge, confidence, and skill on FAVDs before and after simulation training. Our hypothesis is that our intervention will improve both skill and confidence of obstetrics and gynecology residents.


Materials and Methods

This was an Institutional Review Board approved (UCLA [University of California, LA] IRB 16–001820) prospective cohort study. All UCLA Obstetrics and Gynecology residents were eligible to participate in three 90-minute simulation training sessions during the 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018 academic years. Participation was voluntary and refusal to participate did not exclude residents from participating in forceps training. Residents completed an anonymous 26-item pre- and postsimulation confidence survey (see
Supplementary Material S1
and
Supplementary Material S2
). Each participant completed a pre- and postsimulation skills assessment graded with a standardized a priori designed checklist. Skills assessments for both consenting of an operative delivery and the forceps deliveries were evaluated by faculty versed and comfortable in FAVD.


Each simulation session started with and ended with a pre- and postsimulation survey assessing residents about their confidence in forceps deliveries. The curriculum at two of the three simulation sessions was the same, while the other had an additional focus of how to consent patients.

For each simulation session, residents were presented with a clinical case that necessitated expedited delivery. In two of the sessions the residents were then required to complete a FAVD using a “Noelle S550 Maternal Care Patient Simulator,” which allowed for complete simulation of the operative vaginal delivery experience. The case presented was a low-risk nulliparous woman without a maternal or fetal contraindication to an operative delivery. The resident was told she had an appropriate labor curve, completed dilated, ruptured, with a fetus at +2 station, and an estimated fetal weight of 3,400 grams. Residents' skills at an FAVD were assessed with a premade operative checklist. In the third session, the cohort was required to consent a patient, represented using the Noelle Simulator, for a FAVD. The resident was assessed on their ability to discuss the risks, benefits, and alternatives of a FAVD. Residents included in the study participated in anywhere from one to three of the sessions.

Residents then watched a 5-minute video on forceps and forceps deliveries, or consenting, and then received hands-on training with faculty. After they felt they had sufficient practice in the allotted training time (maximum 45 minutes), they completed a postsimulation assessment of their ability to complete a forceps delivery or consent. Only residents who completed both pre- and postsimulation surveys and skills assessments were included in the study.

Our primary outcome was improvement in resident confidence and skill before and after simulation training. Secondary outcomes included the change in percentage of FAVDs performed at our institution before and after initiation of the forceps simulation-based curriculum.

Standard descriptive statistics were reported (median with the first and third quartile). Wilcoxon's signed rank-test was used for the paired comparison between pre and post confidence and percent correct skill assessment scores. Kruskal–Wallis test was used for the comparison of the improvement score by postgraduate year (PGY). All analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Results
Over the 2 academic years, there was a total of 41 residents eligible to participate. There were 30 residents that participated (73% of all residents) in at least one session. Residents participated in one to three of the simulation sessions. On average residents had completed none or one FAVD before the simulation.


Residents were evaluated on their confidence performing FAVDs. There was significant improvement in confidence with FAVD pre- versus postsimulation (
Table 1
), including those looking at the didactical steps of FAVD and consenting the patient on the procedure. There was no difference in the first session regarding residents' confidence in supervising other residents in FAVD. However, in session two there was a statistically significant improvement, demonstrating that the repetition was a factor in developing the ability to supervise or teach.

Discussion
Our simulation successfully improved resident confidence and skill in FAVD and consenting patients for FAVD. Simulation for resident learners is a useful tool for teaching FAVD given the interventions positive impact on both skill and confidence. While the simulation does require a Noelle simulation doll, or a similar tool, it is otherwise easy to reproduce and only requires physicians skilled in the art of FAVD to act as teachers and evaluators. After the simulation, residents expressed more confidence in performing FAVDs and were able to perform more of the skills of a FAVD correctly. Additionally, simulation training narrowed the gap between classes in perceived confidence, thus helping to equalize classes. Importantly, the largest difference in improvement in skill was seen in the earlier years of residency, implying that simulation training needs to be done early to have the greatest impact. However, given that most residents perform so few FAVD during training, it could be thought that we should wait, and focusing on training laborists and maternal fetal medicine physicians in FAVD, rather than residents.


Simulation training is an important complement to traditional teaching methods. It allows for practice and preparation, especially with events that occur in small volumes. While nothing, including simulation, is a perfect substitute for real life experiences, simulation allows us to mimic real life, making us feel prepared for the challenges we face in many acute situations. Simulation allows residents to have practice in the wide variety of procedures performed in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. In one example, as FAVDs decreases, simulation training becomes necessary to maintain resident exposure and comfort. Studies have shown that simulation training, in general and specifically with regards to FAVD, improves patient safety. Not only does simulation improve resident confidence and skill but this translates to better patient outcomes, though is still associated with a 30% risk of severe perineal trauma.

The primary limitations of our study include the small sample size and single institution sample. Additionally, this study demonstrates a short term and immediate change in skill and comfort but does not establish if this change persists over time. Further studies would need to be done to compare resident confidence and immediately skill after a simulation session and throughout training. Our study also demonstrates selection bias, given that residents who wanted to learn FAVD were more likely to participate. Given that we were limited to perform these simulation sessions during scheduled resident teaching time, we did not want to prevent any residents from having the opportunity to learn and thus did not have a control group that would not receive the FAVD simulation training. Finally, while this study did improve perceived confidence and skill at FAVD simulation, we did not show or evaluate improvement in skill level in an actual FAVD or clinical benefit.

Conclusion
In an environment where FAVD have decreased in prevalence and thus resident exposure to such deliveries has decreased, the opportunity for simulation training becomes vital. Incorporating simulation session with FAVD will help to improve resident confidence and skill. Further studies should assess the improvement in resident knowledge on FAVD with simulation.
