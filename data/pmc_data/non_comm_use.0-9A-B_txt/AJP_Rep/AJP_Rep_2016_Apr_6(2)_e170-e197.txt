Objective This study aims to examine the association between different maternal physical activity exposures during pregnancy and infant's birth weight, body composition, and risk of inadequate weight.


Methods Two reviewers (M.B. and J.L.G.) identified observational studies reporting total or leisure time activity during pregnancy and birth weight outcomes. Pooled analyses were performed to summarize the risk associated with high or moderate volumes of physical activity on birth weight.


Results A total of 54 studies among 4,080 reported the association between physical activity and birth weight (37 studies) or risks of small or large birth weight. The association between physical activity and birth weight was evaluated by physical activity levels (low, moderate, or high). Despite heterogeneity, pooled results (23 studies) suggested that moderate levels of activity are associated with an increased birth weight (mean difference: 61.5 g, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 16.6, 106.5, 15 studies), while high levels were associated with lower birth weight (mean difference: −69.9 g, 95% CI: −114.8, −25.0, 15 studies). Data were insufficient to provide robust estimates for other outcomes.


Conclusions The results of observational studies suggest an inverted u-shaped association between physical activity and birth weight, despite methodological variability. These results could help refining physical activity guidelines for pregnancy and provide guidance for future research.

==== Body
As a marker of fetal growth, birth weight, and potentially neonatal body composition, is associated with health markers in later life such as body composition,1 strength, and cardiorespiratory fitness.2
3
4 Birth weight extremes are also associated with adverse health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic dysfunction.5
6
7
8 Accordingly, these outcomes are largely studied, although their determinants remain partly understood.

Leisure time physical activity is associated with the course of a healthy pregnancy, as it can increase cardiorespiratory fitness,9 decrease gestational weight gain,10 and may lower the risk of preeclampsia,11 cesarean section,12 and gestational diabetes.13
14 Recently, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published regarding the effect of maternal physical activity interventions on infant's birth weight, suggesting a modest yet significant decrease in birth weight with physical activity interventions.15
16


The important heterogeneity in physical activity interventions during pregnancy and adherence issues might nevertheless preclude a complete portrait of the impact of physical activity on markers of fetal growth, as this impact is likely to depend on the type, volume, and intensity of physical activity, as well as the conditioning level of the mother and timing during pregnancy.11

19
20 For instance, RCTs are usually initiated during the second trimester of pregnancy, making it difficult to assess the impact of exercise in early pregnancy.

Also, interventions are limited to moderate intensity physical activity, as it is the intensity recommended by numerous pregnancy guidelines.21
22 However, documenting the effects of vigorous intensity activities is crucial to ensure the safety of pregnant women who engage in such activities. In that regard, summarizing data from observational studies could greatly help understanding the effect of this somewhat prevalent behavior. Although previous meta-analyses of RCTs provided important evidence regarding the effect of maternal physical activity on birth weight, data from these studies are insufficient to determine whether these effects are specific to a particular volume, intensity, and timing of physical activity during pregnancy, and whether they rely on a dose–response relationship or if a threshold must be reached to achieve an effect.

Given the large number of observational studies and their potential to complement our understanding of the association between maternal physical activity and fetal growth, we performed a systematic review and when possible a meta-analysis of observational studies with the aim of characterizing the association between different maternal physical activity exposures (volume, intensity, timing during pregnancy, and measurement method) and infant birth weight, body composition, and risk of inappropriate birth weight for gestational age.

Methods
Sources
The protocol was published online on the international prospective register of systematic reviews Web site (CRD42013004968). The search for citations in English or French was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, considering all articles published from 1946, 1947, and 1956 depending on the database, until June 2013. A second search considering articles published between June 2013 and March 2015 was subsequently performed. Search in PubMed included the following MeSH and\or text terms for physical activity: “exercise,” “exertion,” “pliability,” “physical fitness,” “physical education and training,” “exercising,” “physical condition,” “stamina,” “sports,” and “muscle strengthening exercises.” For weight outcomes, the following MeSH or/and text terms were used: “pregnancy,” “pregnancy complications,” “pregnancy outcome,” “birth weight,” “low birth weight,” “high birth weight,” “small for gestational age,” “large for gestational age,” “pregnancy,” “pregnanc*,” “pregnant*,” “pregnancy complication*,” “pregnancy outcome,” “birth weight,” “low birth weight,” “high birth weight,” “small for gestational age,” and “large for gestational age.” Terms were combined using the Boolean operator “OR” within each category, and “AND” when combining between exposure and outcome. A similar approach was used with other databases.

Study Selection
Studies were excluded if they were conference abstracts, reviews, case reports, unpublished articles, or intervention trials. Reviews were manually searched for citations not detected by the electronic search. Citations were combined and duplicates excluded. As prespecified in the protocol, studies were considered only if they measured leisure time or total physical activity. Two reviewers (M. B., J. L. G.) independently screened titles for potential relevance. Titles obviously not related to the topic of interest were excluded. Potentially relevant abstracts were screened using a standardized criterion (i.e., human studies, reference to pregnancy or birth weight or physical activity). Abstracts considered by both reviewers as not relevant were excluded, and full articles were retrieved. Any disagreement was solved by discussion and consensus between the two reviewers (M. B., J. L. G.) and a third author (I. M.) if needed. All included articles were independently reviewed for data extraction on a form, especially conceived before extraction, as follows: study year and country, population, design, the number of exposed/unexposed or cases/controls, definitions, and methods for exposure assessment, including type, frequency, intensity, and timing of physical activity, definitions, and methods for outcome assessment, effect estimates or continuous data, and adjustment variables. Studies were classified based on the design and by the outcome. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale.23


Outcomes
The outcomes of interest were the neonate's birth weight in grams, low and high birth weight (LBW, HBW), defined as a birth weight below 2,500 g and above 4,000 g, respectively, small and large for gestational age (SGA, LGA) if birth weight for gestational age was below the 10th and above the 90th percentile, respectively, and body composition, defined as fat percentage, fat mass or lean mass in grams.

Exposure
Maternal physical activity was defined as either leisure time physical activity or total physical activity performed during pregnancy and not related to an intervention. Leisure time activity (including sports, exercise, and recreational activities) was chosen as it is the focus of physical activity recommendations. However, since leisure time activity only accounts for around 10% of pregnant women's energy expenditure,24
25 total activity (including all domains, e.g., work-related activity) was also considered. To be as inclusive as possible, it was determined that physical activity could be defined according to volume (product of frequency, intensity, and duration), frequency, intensity, and/or duration alone. With the increasing popularity of objective measurement devices (e.g., accelerometers), we also wanted to verify whether studies using such technology, or other objective methods to measure physical activity, would provide more consistent results compared with the overall evaluation of all eligible studies.

To investigate whether the association between physical activity and birth weight outcomes differed by physical activity levels, study groups (when available) were classified as “high level,” “moderate level,” or “low level/sedentary.” A study group was classified as “high level” if the authors stated that this group performed vigorous intensity activity, if the group performed a high volume of activity, defined as at least three sessions per week of at least 30 minutes (which is similar to the recommendations of vigorous activity for the general population)26 and ideally with a specification of intensity, or if the group was the one with the highest energy expenditure, duration, or intensity of physical activity in studies with more than two groups, allowing the comparison of groups with the largest difference in physical activity levels. Therefore, in this review, “level” refers to physical activity categorization regardless of whether a study defines physical activity by volume, frequency, intensity, or duration. Study groups not meeting the criteria of “high level” of activity or classified as “moderately active” by the authors were included in our “moderate level” comparison. In both the cases, moderate- and high-level groups were compared with the group having the lowest activity level in the study.

Data Analysis
Due to an important heterogeneity in the way studies defined, measured and quantified physical activity, studies were exclusively pooled to answer our main question regarding how physical activity volume and/or intensity could modulate infant's birth weight, based on a cautious classification of studies (as described above). To account for variability across studies and to derive conservative assessments of the uncertainty in the estimates, a Der Simonian and Laird random effects model was used.27 Data were pooled using the weighted unstandardized mean difference in effect size across studies. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 statistic,28 with high heterogeneity defined as I2 ≥ 75%.28 The results were considered significant if p < 0.05.

Association between Maternal Physical Activity and Birth Weight
Global Results of the Association between Maternal Physical Activity and Birth Weight
A total of 37 studies (68.5% of all 54 studies) reported the association between physical activity (total and/or leisure time physical activity) and birth weight. Among these studies, 25 (67.6%) did not observe a statistically significant difference in birth weight within various physical activity levels, or vice versa. Conversely, 8 of the 37 studies (21.6%) found a significant decrease in birth weight with increasing maternal activity,33

Data from 23 studies (62.2% of the 37 studies) could be pooled to evaluate the association between physical activity levels and birth weight. Overall, 17 studies (45.9% of the 37 studies) reported the association between physical activity during pregnancy and birth weight comparing high levels of physical activity with no activity or low levels (Fig. 2).33

Association between Maternal Physical Activity and Newborn's Body Composition
Several studies reported more than one birth weight outcome, but only two did report on the association between maternal physical activity and infant's body composition.36
75 Clapp and Capeless36 compared a group of recreational athletes pursuing a heavy exercise regimen throughout pregnancy to a group of matched active women not involved in high-intensity training. Skinfold thickness, fat mass, and body fat percentage of the newborns were all significantly reduced in the heavy exercise group as compared with the comparison group, with a difference in fat mass of 220 g between groups. Similarly, Harrod et al75 observed a significant decrease in neonatal fat mass with increased total physical activity during the third trimester (p for linear trend = 0.04). A significant 41.1 g difference between neonates of women in the highest versus the lowest quartile of total activity was observed after adjustment for various confounders. However, early and midpregnancy physical activity had no significant effect on body composition, nor did meeting exercise recommendations in either trimester.

32 although one of them also found that low levels of exercise increased the risk of LBW, compared with moderate levels.29 The other case–control studies found a decreased risk of LBW with increasing maternal leisure activity.30

Discussion
The present systematic review identified 54 observational studies evaluating the association between maternal physical activity during pregnancy and birth weight, the risk of LBW or HBW, risk of SGA or LGA, or body composition. Despite the substantial heterogeneity, results from these studies suggest that moderate levels of physical activity during pregnancy are associated with an increased birth weight, as compared with lower levels. On the contrary, high levels of physical activity were associated with a decreased birth weight. These associations remained when leisure time physical activity alone was considered. Despite the fact that only a few studies evaluated physical activity using objective methods, results from these studies suggested similar conclusions.

Consistent with the decrease in birth weight observed with high physical activity levels, the two studies evaluating neonatal body composition found that high levels of activity were associated with a decreased infant fat mass. Reduced neonatal fat mass was previously found in an RCT comparing women pursuing either a moderate or high volume exercise regimen from the 8th week to end of pregnancy, compared with women pursuing a low volume exercise regimen.19 The same authors found no difference in neonatal fat mass or percentage in previously inactive women randomized to either a low volume exercise regimen or no exercise throughout pregnancy,18 which is also consistent with the findings of the present review. These observations could either imply that the association between maternal activity and birth weight follows an inverted u-shaped curve, or that a certain amount of exercise is needed before birth weight is reduced. Some observational studies are more suggestive of a dose–response relationship; Harrod et al75 showed that the association between total physical activity in late pregnancy and neonatal fat mass followed a linear trend. Another large cohort study (n = 43,705) found that each additional monthly exercise session was associated with a significant 2.1 g decrease in infant birth weight.62


Overall, despite substantial heterogeneity between studies, maternal physical activity does not seem to negatively influence the risk of birth weight extremes. Indeed, the present review highlighted that most studies evaluating HBW and LGA risk found a protective effect with increasing maternal activity, which is in line with the decreased neonatal fat mass or body weight observed in numerous studies. The association between maternal activity and risk of LBW and SGA was less clear, although available studies are reassuring. Globally, results from observational studies are confirmed by a recent meta-analysis evaluating the effects of 28 physical activity interventions during pregnancy. This meta-analysis found a significant reduction in birth weight (n = 5,214) and a reduction in the risk of delivering a macrosomic infant (19 studies, n = 3,982) without an increased risk of LBW/SGA (11 studies, n = 2,183), with exercise interventions.15 However, the impact of exercise dose was not examined in this meta-analysis.

Physical activity is thought to modulate fetal growth through oxygen and nutrient availability and delivery to the fetus.83 Indeed, glucose availability is reduced during exercise due to an increased uptake by active muscles,83 and uteroplacental blood flow also appears to be decreased with exercise.84
85 It has been hypothesized that in response to this intermittent reduction in oxygen and nutrient delivery during exercise, which seems modulated by exercise intensity and/or volume,84
85
86 blood flow is then enhanced at rest.83 Consistent with our thorough review, Clapp previously reported the results of a few studies suggesting that a low-to-moderate volume of exercise throughout pregnancy was associated with an increased birth weight while a high-intensity, high-volume exercise regimen throughout pregnancy was associated with a decreased birth weight, with various effects in between.83 Accordingly, it appears that below a certain threshold, the reduced nutrient availability induced by exercise is compensated and results in enhanced fetal growth, while above this threshold nutrient availability cannot be completely compensated, leading to reduced birth weight. Of course, glucose availability and delivery to the fetus is also influenced by other factors, including maternal nutrition, health condition, and fitness,83
87 thus it is possible that the effects of exercise on fetal growth are seldom counterbalanced by other maternal behaviors and conditions. Thus, this suggested inverted u-shape relationship between physical activity and birth weight, which can be modulated by factors such as maternal diet, could explain the discrepancy observed in RCTs' results.

Previous meta-analyses of RCTs also showed a small reduction in infant's birth weight with physical activity interventions, but were unable to distinguish the effects of various volumes or intensity of physical activity.15
16 Although it was not possible to combine the results in a quantitative estimate for all outcomes and comparisons, we still attempted to determine the influence of physical activity volume on birth weight. Despite significant statistical heterogeneity, our prudent classification of studies provided new insights on the association between maternal physical activity and birth weight. However, whether our classification was adequate to truly discriminate moderate level from high level of physical activity remains debatable, as we mostly relied on the studies' own classification of physical activity levels. For instance, although some studies stated having evaluated vigorous intensity activity, their definition of vigorous intensity did not necessarily comply with accepted definitions (≥60% aerobic capacity reserve)88 or was somewhat imprecise. This implies that the measure of physical activity in these studies likely included both moderate and vigorous intensity activity. Thus, adequately defining intensity will be of prime importance in future studies, to accurately evaluate the impact of various physical activity intensities on pregnancy outcomes.

Limitations
This systematic review included observational studies evaluating the association between maternal physical activity and birth weight outcomes; therefore, the associations observed may not constitute causal relationships. Results must also be interpreted with caution due to the high heterogeneity found between study results, methodology, and quality, which on one hand limited the possibility to pool some studies in the meta-analysis, leading to a potential selection bias, and on the other hand might also have decreased the strength of the associations found in the present review. It should also be acknowledged that study results were included in the analyses, even when adjustment for confounders was lacking. Indeed, more than one-third of the studies included in the present review did not adjust for covariates known or thought to influence physical activity and fetal growth. Finally, publication bias cannot be ruled out, as some studies with null results might not have been published. Although a publication bias would imply that the associations observed in the present review overestimate the real association between maternal physical activity and birth weight, and despite the aforementioned limitations, we believe that it is unlikely that our finding of a different association between maternal physical activity and birth weight depending on physical activity volume would be discredited. Nevertheless, further confirmation of this volume-dependent association is needed.

Recommendations for Future Research
The present review highlighted that observational studies can help us gain a better insight of the mechanisms explaining the association between maternal activity and birth weight outcomes. However, to further clarify the association between maternal physical activity and birth weight, some issues need to be addressed first. For instance, a precise and meticulous measure of maternal physical activity, including all physical activity parameters, will be needed to identify the potential thresholds where physical activity can be expected to influence birth weight differently. As previously proposed, since physical activity might exert only a modest effect on birth weight outcomes, accurate methods to measure physical activity are needed to avoid missing this effect because of measurement error.89 Accordingly, studies using objective measurement methods such as accelerometry, which are thought to provide more precise and accurate estimates of physical activity, free of recall, and self-report bias, are needed as only five studies using accelerometry were available for inclusion in the present review. However, efforts should also be made in harmonizing accelerometry data processing in pregnancy studies to allow a better reliability of physical activity estimates and comparability between studies, since no cut point has been developed specifically for pregnancy and no consensus has been made regarding data processing, leading to great methodological variability regarding accelerometry data in pregnancy studies.73

Also, although the decreased birth weight observed with increasing physical activity in the present review and in previous meta-analyses of RCTs might be beneficial for the child's health, it is possible that this effect could become detrimental above a certain level of physical activity, leading to an increased risk of SGA or other adverse outcomes. Obviously, the identification of this potential threshold will not be possible through RCTs for ethical reasons. The same situation applies regarding the effects of vigorous intensity activity on pregnancy outcomes, or the effects of physical activity in high-risk populations, emphasizing the need for additional high-quality observational studies. Similarly, to improve our understanding of the impact of physical activity performed during the first trimester, which remains limited due to the difficulty in initiating a physical activity intervention before the end of this trimester, observational studies appear as an important alternative, complementing knowledge acquired through RCTs. To further precise the association between physical activity and fetal growth, future research should also focus on outcomes such as neonatal body composition and mechanistic pathways while considering important confounders.

Refining physical activity guidelines for pregnant women to optimize fetal growth will only be possible when the aforementioned issues and others will be adequately answered. In light of available evidence, we believe that this can only be achieved through high-quality observational studies and RCTs.

Conclusion
Based on observational studies, maternal physical activity during pregnancy does not seem to negatively influence birth weight or risk of birth weight extremes in healthy, low-risk pregnant women. The association between maternal physical activity levels and infant's birth weight suggests an inverted u-shaped curve, where moderate levels seem associated with an increased birth weight while high levels of physical activity seem associated with a decreased birth weight. Maternal physical activity also appears to be associated with a reduced neonatal fat mass, but the small number of studies evaluating neonatal body composition precludes definitive conclusions. Future studies should focus on precisely defining and measuring physical activity in each trimester to determine the volume, type, and intensity of physical activity needed to influence the neonate's body size and composition and to allow better study comparability. Underrepresented groups of pregnant women, such as women with high-risk pregnancy, should also be studied. As the intrauterine environment might have a long term influence on the child's health, it is crucial to evaluate the effects of various levels and patterns of physical activity during pregnancy to identify the optimal physical activity prescription. A careful monitoring of physical activity type, frequency, intensity, and duration in each trimester of pregnancy and of its effects on pregnancy outcomes in various populations will definitely contribute to this important objective.
