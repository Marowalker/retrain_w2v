Objective
 This study is to review published cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) treated with bromocriptine and outline pros and cons of the treatment strategy.



Data Sources
 Data were collected from PubMed/MedLine, ClinicalTrials.gov; the years 2007 to 2018 were searched for English-language articles. Search terms: “bromocriptine and peripartum cardiomyopathy”, “bromocriptine and cardiomyopathy.”



Methods of Study Selection
 This search strategy yielded 171 articles. After excluding duplicates, 86 studies were reviewed. Sixty-one articles involving the treatment of PPCMP were included, and of these, 17 were case reports of patients with PPCMP treated with bromocriptine; these studies were included in this review.



Tabulation, Integration, and Results
 Seventeen of these articles were case reports of patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy treated with bromocriptine that were included.



Conclusion
 Bromocriptine seems to be a promising treatment, there is currently insufficient evidence for universal utilization of bromocriptine for all patients with PPCMP. Addition of bromocriptine to the standard heart failure therapy should be individualized.

==== Body
Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare but potentially devastating form of cardiomyopathy occurring late in pregnancy or early postpartum period in previously healthy women.
1
Pregnancy associated heart failure was first described in the 1800s; however it was not until 1971 that Demakis and Rahimtoola who recognized the disease as a distinct entity and coined the term peripartum cardiomyopathy.
1
2
3
According to the 2010 European Society of Cardiology (ESC), diagnosis of PPCM is made by echocardiography demonstrating ejection fracture of < 45% with or without the left ventricular dilation with no evidence of other potential etiologies of heart failure.
4
Our goal is to provide brief overview of PPCM, review published cases of PPCM treated with bromocriptine and outline pros and cons of the treatment strategy.


Incidence and Risk Factors

Incidence of PPCM in the United States varies widely from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 4,000 live births.
5
The risk of PPCM is largely influenced by ethnicity with African-American women at highest risk followed by Asians, whites, and Hispanic women.
6
Geographically, the highest incidence is encountered in Haiti (1 in 300 pregnancies) and South Africa (1 in 1,000 pregnancies).
7
8
9
Other risk factors include multiparity, multifetal gestation, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and advanced maternal age.
8
In fact, greater than 50% of cases occur in women older than 30 years old.
1


Treatment Options for PPCM

Treatment of PPCM is similar to other types of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Mainstay of therapy is salt and fluid restriction, diuretics, vasodilators, and beta blockers. Anticoagulation may be indicated in selected cases. However, the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE) and angiotensin receptor blockers, (ARB) which have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality are deferred until after delivery.

Natural History of PPCM and Outcomes

Overall, outcomes of PPCM tend to be favorable compared to other types of cardiomyopathies as it is less likely to progress to end stage than heart failure caused by other etiologies.
12
With current treatment modalities, PPCM patients have a 50% rate of recovery and 98% chance of survival.
13
Previously, it was thought that if PPCM were to resolve, it would do so within 6 months of diagnosis and it persisted past this time point; it was considered a poor prognostic factor.
2
However, more recently, Fett et al followed 116 Haitian patients with PPCM and only 27.6% achieved full recovery; of those who recovered, 53% did not achieve full recovery for at least 18 months.
14
While this may be specific to the Haitian population, it appears that this disease may take a more significant amount of time to resolve than previously thought. Further, the risk of recurrence of PPCM is high and those who have had a pregnancy complicated by it are counseled to avoid future pregnancy.
15


Theories for Causation

The exact etiology of PPCM remains unknown; however, significant advances have been made to elucidate causation of PPCM. The largest umbrella of hypotheses include the “oxidative stress–prolactin axis” and “antiangiogenic–signaling excess” hypotheses.
7
The “oxidative stress–prolactin axis” hypothesis stems from the elevated markers of inflammation and apoptosis found in PPCM.
16
17
A transgenic mouse model of PPCM was developed to investigate potential mechanisms of the disease. Using this mouse model, Sliwa et al showed that oxidative stress allows expression and activation of a lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin D which cleaves serum prolactin into an antiangiogenic and pro apoptotic 16-kDa prolactin sub fragment that incite and propagates myocardial damage.
18
The study also showed that blocking the release of prolactin inhibited degeneration of the cardiac capillary network, thereby decreasing myocyte damage.
18
Another study by Forster at al showed that increased levels of both prolactin and interferongamma were associated with increased inflammatory status and adverse outcomes in PPCM.
19
Recent data show that the “oxidative stress–prolactin axis” and the “antiangiogenic–signaling excess” probably converges in a final pathway of imbalanced cardiac remodeling in the peripartum phase, thereby causing myocardial injury secondary to metabolic “shortages.”
8
Other proposed causative factors which will not be described here, include: selenium deficiency, viral myocarditis, and immune mediated cardiac damage.


Bromocriptine as a Therapy for PPCM
Bromocriptine is an ergot derivative with dopamine agonistic activity that inhibits the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. It is FDA approved for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia-associated endocrine dysfunction, acromegaly, Parkinson's disease, and to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. In the past, it has also been used to inhibit lactation when medically indicated. Given the evidence to support the oxidative stress–prolactin hypothesis of PPCM, bromocriptine has been introduced as a potential beneficial addition to standard the treatment for PPCM.


Since the publications of the oxidative stress–prolactin axis model, there has been significant interest in the use of bromocriptine for prolactin inhibition in PPCMP cases demonstrating a positive impact on left ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA (New York Heart Association) class. However, bromocriptine is not without risks. Serious adverse events have been reported in postpartum women using bromocriptine for lactation suppression including myocardial infarction, seizures, and stroke.
20
Among patients with adverse events after bromocriptine, many events may have been avoided if treatment was discontinued with the initial manifestations of adverse reaction.
21
While a causal relationship remains unclear, routine use of bromocriptine for prevention of physiologic lactation is not recommended. Cessation of lactation may also pose significant disadvantage to the neonate; however, Sliwa et al showed normal growth and survival of neonates with mothers treated with bromocriptine.
22
Bromocriptine is contraindicated in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension, as it can worsen blood pressures during pregnancy or postpartum periods. Therefore, the risk to benefit ratio of bromocriptine makes it a poor choice for lactation suppression but may be worth taking the risk of adverse events in PPCMP as it may significantly improve cardiac outcomes (
Table 1
).

Results

We describe a review of the existing case studies from 2007 to 2018 that discusses use of bromocriptine in patients with PPCM (
Table 2
and
3
). These case reports describe the use of bromocriptine in 30 individual women, ranging in age from 18 to 43 years. The study subjects vary with respect to their country of origin, gravidities and parities, and gestational age. The onset of PPCM ranged from prior to delivery to as late as a month after delivery. The majority of these women recovered their left ventricular ejection fraction after receiving bromocriptine, typically dosed from 2.5 to 5 mg daily, in conjunction with the standard heart failure therapy. Though many women presented with low ejection fractions, (range: 8–45%), many were able to report NYHA classes II and I at time of follow-up.

While most of these are individual, heterogeneous case reports, 10 of these cases came from a pilot study comparing women with newly diagnosed PPCM receiving standard heart failure care (
n
 = 10) versus standard care and bromocriptine (
n
 = 10). This study demonstrated that the addition of bromocriptine to standard heart failure therapy improved NYHA functional class, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, and degree of functional mitral regurgitation in women with PPCMP. Though this trial was small and far from definitive, the data appeared to show greater improvement in the group that received bromocriptine. Subsequently, a multicenter randomized controlled trial evaluated outcomes of 63 patients with PPCM who were treated with 1 or 8 weeks of bromocriptine in addition to standard therapy revealed that patients treated with bromocriptine was associated with higher rate of left ventricular recovery and had low morbidity and mortality.
23
Post hoc analysis of this study demonstrated an improvement of the right ventricular function in addition to the left ventricular function at 6 month follow-up in women treated with bromocriptine.
24
Bromocriptine may have a role in PPCMP patients with biventricular dysfunction. Addition of bromocriptine to the standard heart failure therapy, i.e. BOARD (Bromocriptine, Oral heart failure drugs, Anticoagulation, Relaxants [vasodilators for SBP > 110 mm Hg], Diuretics) has been proposed. Of note, prophylactic anticoagulation should be used when using bromocriptine to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications.
25


Conclusion
There is currently insufficient evidence for universal use of bromocriptine in addition to the standard treatment of PPCM. However, there are data to suggest that bromocriptine improves clinical outcomes. We recommend consideration of bromocriptine in selected cases of PPCMP. Future studies are indicated to elucidate its role as a standard therapy.

Précis
Bromocriptine seems to be a promising treatment for peripartum cardiomyopathy but there is a need for further clinical trials.
