Subsequent to the publication of this article, some interested readers advised the authors that a sentence in the manuscript may be misunderstood.

Therefore, the authors have amended the sentence, ‘The uterus was exchanged between two cynomolgus monkeys and one successfully achieved natural pregnancy following menstruation (36)’, page 125, right column, line 7, to, ‘In uterine autotransplantation in cynomolgus macaques, one successfully achieved natural pregnancy following menstruation (36)’.

The authors guarantee that this modification does not alter the conclusions discussed in the review, and apologize for any misunderstanding caused.
