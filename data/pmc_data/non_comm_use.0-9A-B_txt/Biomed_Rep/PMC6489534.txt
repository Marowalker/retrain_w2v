A total of 121 eyes in which we performed conventional cataract surgery with implantation of a monofocal lens were included in the study group. The postoperative examination of near visual acuity was performed at two different positions of the eye at a constant distance from the reading table, with the assumption of improving visual acuity when looking perpendicularly to the plane of the floor. The mutual relation of the postoperative parameters central keratometry (Kc), keratometry in the visual axis (KVA) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) for the single axial length ranges was determined using the correlation coefficients. In the case of vertical position of the eye (visual axis of the eye perpendicular to the floor), the uncorrected visual acuity following implantation of the monofocal lens was higher or equal compared to the horizontal position of the eye (visual axis of the eye parallel to the floor). The mean visual acuity at the horizontal position of the eye was 0.508 according to Jaeger's tables (P<0.001); at the vertical position, the mean value was 0.555 (P<0.001). Within the entire group, a weak association at best was observed between the postoperative parameters (Kc, KVA and ACD) and subsequent near visual acuity. Different dependence was found after categorising the group according to the axial length of the eye. In conclusion, the near visual acuity in eyes with an implanted monofocal lens for emmetropy to distance reached higher values at the vertical vs. horizontal position of the eyes. However, neither of the observed parameters (KC, KVA or ACD) can be unambiguously determined as decisive for the assumption of the described feature.

Introduction
In the framework of cataract surgery, a comfortable postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) may be successfully achieved due to the development of modern biometric methods and calculation formulas. However, patients also require to be able to see a normal reading text without further correction, which has led to the development of multifocal or accommodation intraocular lenses (IOLs). The challenge of these models is the number of contraindications, risk of asthenopic problems caused by higher-order aberrations, as well as the additional required payment by the patient.

For pseudophakic eyes, in addition to the optimal UDVA, the optimal uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) may also be seen, although a monofocal IOL has been implanted. In a previous study (1) it was proven that optimal near visual acuity may be achieved even without targeted postoperative myopisation in eyes with a short axial length (AL). For 30.33% of eyes with a UNVA of ≥0.6, the AL was ≤23.5 mm, whereas even for a UNVA of 0.8, the AL was up to 22.5 mm. Theoretically, a significant role of the postoperative pseudo-accommodation amplitude in such eyes may be expected, particularly the effect of an axial shift of the IOL causing a reduction of the anterior chamber depth (ACD), which occurs even when the direction of view of the eye is changed. It was proven that a change in the position of the eye affects the ACD, albeit to a lesser extent than predicted (2). The hydrodynamic status in the eye is practically indefinable with regard to several influencing factors. However, the validity of Pascal's law is hypothesised, and due to the hydrostatic pressure under the influence of a small gravitational force, the shift of the IOL causes a slight myopisation that likely confers an increase in near visual acuity.

The subject of the present study was a statistical evaluation of a change in the UNVA depending on the position of the text or a change of the direction of the eye, including an analysis of a mutual correlation of the individual eye parameters.

Materials and methods

Study parameters
In total, 121 eyes were evaluated following surgery in 65 patients. Patients who underwent cataract surgery with implantation of a monofocal IOL were included in the study. The patient selection was performed randomly, depending on the time the patients came for the check-up examinations between January and March 2017. The surgery was performed by a single surgeon using an identical technique (phacoemulsification using the initial incision of 2.2 mm), and the relation SRK/T was used to calculate the optical power of the IOL for emmetropy; the evaluation period was at least 1 month post-surgery. The following models of IOL were implanted: MA50BM (58.68% of eyes), SA60AT (23.14%), SN60WF (13.22%) and SN6ATx (4.96%). Only the postoperatively emmetropic eyes among the eyes examined were included, with 97.52% of the eyes achieving a vision of 1.0 or better (the remaining 2.48% of the eyes achieved a vision of 0.8, whereas no correction improved the vision). Input data for the study are summarised in Table I.

The evaluated postoperative parameters included the typography values (Anterior Segment Analyser Orbscan II) for optical power in the central part of the cornea (KC), as well as in the visual axis (KVA), anterior chamber depth (ACD; OcuScan biometer) and eye axial length (AL; OcuScan biometer).

To determine the near vision values, each eye was examined separately using the Jäeger table ZEISS at a distance of 40 cm and its perpendicular position relative to the eye viewing axis. First, the value of the least read text was recorded at the horizontal position of the eye (UNVAH, viewing axis of the eye parallel with the floor) and subsequently at the vertical position (UNVAV, viewing axis of the eye perpendicular to the floor). Demonstration of the position of the mutual axes is shown on Fig. 1. The observed parameters were evaluated for the whole group of patients, but also following categorisation of the group into three cohorts according to the AL: The group of short eyes (AL<22.5) included eyes up to 22.5 mm, AL 22.5-23.5 mm was identified as the group of normal eyes (AL22.5-23.5) and the cohort of long eyes had an AL >23.5 mm (AL>23.5).

Results

Mean parameters of the input group following categorization
The mean age of the group was 71 years. The mean parameter values of the eyes included in the study are presented in Table II.

Mean values of UNVAH and UNVAV
The paired t-test was used to compare visual acuity at the horizontal and vertical position of the eye for the whole group of patients. The results revealed that, in the case of UNVAH for the horizontal position of the eye, the values were lower compared with UNVAV for the vertical position of the eye (mean 0.51 vs. 0.56, respectively; P<0.001). A higher or identical UNVAV value compared with UNVAH was always achieved in all groups based on the AL. Visual improvement in UNVAV was observed in 40.2% of the eyes. The lowest mean value for the UNVAH was recorded in eyes with an AL >23.5 mm. The highest mean value for the UNVAV was achieved in short eyes (mean 0.58; P<0.001). The complete values are summarised in Table III.

Correlation coefficients
Evaluation of the association of the eye parameters for UNVAH and UNVAH was performed using correlation coefficients (Table IV). We did not identify a more significant than weak correlation value for the whole group. For the AL<22.5 group, we observed a weak negative correlation of the UNVAH with AL (-0.39), but a moderate negative correlation was observed for AL and UNVAV (-0.45). In the AL22.5-23.5 group of eyes, the positive correlation of the UNVAH with KC (0.45) and KVA (0.34), and of UNVAV with KC (0.42) and KVA (0.33), was found to be more significant. For eyes with an AL >23.5 mm there was only a weak negative correlation of UNVAV with ACD (-0.28).

Discussion
During the postoperative evaluation of patients with implanted monofocal IOL following standard cataract surgery, an unexpectedly high postoperative near visual acuity was observed. To predict this effect, scientific studies have gradually attempted to identify a correlation between eye parameters and this phenomenon. The pupil size and AL were not conclusively found to be correlated with near vision in 84 patients. However, a pupil diameter <2.6 mm along with AL <23 mm demonstrated better near visual acuity (3). Our previous study partially supports these conclusions, as our data revealed a moderate negative correlation of the postoperative UNVA with a decreasing AL (<22.5 mm) (1).

Association of age with UNVA was not proven in the present study, whereas Hayashi et al (4) confirmed that patient age is a negative factor affecting the postoperative amplitude of pseudo-accommodation (correlation coefficient of -0.49); however, that study also included patients aged <40 years, while only 3 patients were <60 years of age in the present study. A relevant assessment of the dependence on age would require a higher age range. According to Nanavatyet al (5), corneal astigmatism (against the rule) is a significant factor that increases the possibility of pseudo-accommodation up to 10-fold.

A more statistically significant dependence on preoperative ACD, KC or KVA for the whole group of patients was not observed. When comparing different positions of the read text and the position of the eyes, there was a probability of increasing the value of the near vision for the vertical position (UNVAV). The mean values show an increase of near visual acuity in all patients, particularly those with an AL <22.5 mm. It is believed that, in short eyes with an implanted IOL of higher optical power, the same value of its displacement towards the cornea will cause a higher myopia compared with an IOL that of lower optical power.
