Following publication, the authors noted a repeated error, which they would like to correct for the record, as follows: In the Abstract on page 69, line 9, the word ‘higher’ (‘…significantly higher…’) should have been ‘lower’; the sentence should therefore have read: ‘The plasma level of linoleic acid (LA) in the subjects with hypertension (systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg) was identified to be significantly lower than that in the healthy controls.’

The same error in the Discussion on page 71, lines 1–3, should be corrected as follows: ‘The present study demonstrated that the plasma level of LA in the subjects with hypertension was significantly lower than that in those without hypertension.’

The authors guarantee that this modification does not alter the conclusions of the study, and apologize for any misunderstanding caused.
