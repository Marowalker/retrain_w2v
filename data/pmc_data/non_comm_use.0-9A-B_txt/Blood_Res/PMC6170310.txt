==== Body
In some acute myeloid leukemia (AML), morphological characteristics and gene rearrangement are closely related. AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1);RUNX1-RUNX1T1 is characterized by perinuclear clearing (hofs), very large granules (pseudo-Chediak-Higashi granules), and a single long and sharp Auer rod with tapered ends in blasts. A 34-year-old woman presented with dyspnea for 2 weeks. She had a history of breast cancer treated with six cycles of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Her initial white blood cell count was 22.0×109/L (55% blasts), hemoglobin level was 4.3 g/dL, and platelet count was 14×109/L. Bone marrow was packed with blasts (46% of all nucleated cells) and myeloid cells. Orange-pink granules/globules were present in some blasts and myeloid cells, and some myeloid cells showed homogeneous pink cytoplasm (A–C). Flow cytometry revealed that the blasts were positive for CD13, CD33, CD34, CD56, CD117, HLA-DR, and cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase. Her karyotype was 45,X,-X,del(2)(q33), t(8;21)(q22;q22)[9]/47,XX,+4,t(8;21)(q22;q22)[5]/46,XX[6]. Multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using HemaVision kit revealed the presence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcripts. The patient was diagnosed with therapy-related AML with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 based on the 2016 World Health Organization classification. When pseudo-Chediak-Higashi granules are observed in blasts and/or myeloid cells, the presence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 rearrangement should be strongly suspected.
