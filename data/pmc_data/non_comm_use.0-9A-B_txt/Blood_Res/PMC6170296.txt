TO THE EDITOR: Mastocytosis is a spectrum of disorders related to the proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in one or more organs. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) was classified by World Health Organisation (WHO) classification for hematolymphoid neoplasms in 2008 as a myeloproliferative neoplasm. However, in the 2016 update of the WHO classification, it has been regarded as a separate entity. SM is sub-classified into indolent SM, smoldering SM, SM with an associated hematological neoplasm (AHN), aggressive SM, and mast cell leukemia [1]. SM is characterized by involvement of at least one extracutaneous organ with or without evidence of skin lesions [2]. We are presenting a rare case of aggressive SM with massive splenomegaly, which could be diagnosed on bone marrow (BM) immunophenotyping.

Case Report
A 61-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of progressively increasing left hypochondriac lump, abdominal pain, and progressive weight loss of 25–30 kg in the last 3 months. There was no fever, night sweats, blood in stools, hematemesis, bony pain, or bleeding from any other site. He was an occasional alcoholic and non-smoker. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile with normal vital signs. No pallor, icterus, clubbing, cyanosis, edema, and peripheral lymphadenopathy were found. Abdominal examination revealed massive splenomegaly (16 cm below the left coastal margin) and hepatomegaly (4 cm below the right coastal margin), with the rest of the systemic examination within normal limits. The complete blood count showed hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 5,480/µL, and platelet count of 282,000/µL. Differential count revealed neutrophils 70%, lymphocytes 11%, monocytes 4%, metamyelocyte 1%, basophil 1%, and eosinophils 13%. The absolute eosinophil count was 712/µL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 180 U/L (laboratory reference range is 91–180 U/L). HIV/HBsAg/HCV were negative. Liver and renal function tests were normal. Stool examination was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasonography showed massive splenomegaly with hepatomegaly and normal echotexture of the liver.

In view of marked hepatosplenomegaly, BM aspiration and biopsy were done. BM aspiration showed hypercellular marrow with myeloid predominance and prominent eosinophils and their precursors constituting 23% of the myelogram. Blasts were not increased. Mast cells were increased in the aspirate and imprint smears and highlighted by toluidine blue staining (Fig. 1A). Some mast cells exhibited hypogranularity and oval nuclei, instead of normal round (Fig. 1A inset). The overall mast cell percentage was −8%. The flow cytometric (FCM) analysis of the BM aspirate showed aberrant immunophenotype in mast cells. The CD117-positive mast cells showed aberrant expression of CD2 and CD25. In addition, they exhibited slight downregulation of CD117 (Fig. 1B–E). BM biopsy showed 80–90% cellularity with marked eosinophilic hyperplasia and increased megakaryocytes. There were multiple large aggregates of mast cells found mostly around the perivascular and paratrabecular regions. The paratrabecular aggregates were causing new bone formation (Fig. 2A). Each aggregate comprised more than 15 cells, with >25% exhibiting atypical morphology (Fig. 2B). The reticulin staining showed grade 2 fibrosis. Toluidine blue staining was performed on BM aspiration and biopsy, which highlighted the mast cell hyperplasia (Fig. 2C). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for CD117 was performed, and mast cells were found to be positive (Fig. 2D). The reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for FIP1L1-PDGFRA was negative. However, KITD816V mutation and serum tryptase could not be performed as the patient was hesitant. Further, a history of diarrhea was elicited from the patient.

Therefore, the patient fulfilled the major criteria of the presence of dense mast cell aggregates and the minor criteria of atypical morphology and abnormal immunophenotype and was, hence, classified as having SM. Further, he had three “B” findings in the form of presence of splenomegaly without hypersplenism, hepatomegaly without ascites, and myeloproliferation. Moreover, the history of diarrhea and weight loss pointed toward the presence of one C finding of malabsorption.

Considering all the above findings and investigations, we diagnosed our patient with aggressive SM. The patient was initially administered with interferon alpha but was lost to follow-up.

Discussion
Mastocytosis is an infrequent condition characterized by abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells in various organs. This condition is subdivided into cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) and SM [2]. CM is more frequent during childhood and usually presents at an early age usually in the first year of life. SM involves at least one extracutaneous organ and may follow an indolent course or may be associated with life-threatening symptoms. The BM is the most frequently involved organ in SM [3]. The diagnosis of SM requires one major and one minor criteria of classification of WHO 2008. Further sub-classification of SM requires the presence of “B” and “C” findings. One of the minor WHO 2008 criteria for the diagnosis of SM is aberrant expression of CD2 and/or CD25 by neoplastic mast cells [2]. These diagnostic criteria have remained the same in the WHO 2016 classification [1].

In the past few years, immunophenotyping of mast cells has become a useful adjunct in the evaluation of SM. The normal mast cells are positive for CD117 and consistently negative for CD2 and CD25. In SM, the mast cells are commonly positive for CD2, CD25, or both. Although both IHC and FCM analysis can be performed, IHC assessment for CD2 and/or CD25 is difficult, because lymphocytes and few other activated cells also express these markers. However, FCM uses a multiparametric approach that allows the aberrant expression of the above markers on specifically gated mast cells [4], and this was applied in our case. Thus, these markers distinguish neoplastic mast cells from normal and reactive mast cells as they both do not express CD2 and CD25 [5].

Being an extremely sensitive method, FCM is useful in detecting neoplastic mast cells even with a low burden of the disease and expected to identify even those cases which do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for SM [4]. It proved to be an important diagnostic tool in the present case as mast cells may be increased in many reactive conditions as well.

Conclusion
The diagnosis of SM requires a cognisance of this rare entity along with a high index of suspicion. It should be considered as one of the differential diagnoses in cases with massive splenomegaly especially when the usual causes have been excluded. The assessment of the immunophenotype of mast cells is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of SM. This case also highlights the role of FCM in identifying abnormal mast cells based on routinely available markers in laboratories performing leukemia FCM.
