ecological advantages as they allow individuals to deal with novel social and
ecological challenges. Innovation is a solution to a novel problem or a novel
solution to an old problem, with the latter being especially difficult. Finding a
new solution to an old problem requires individuals to inhibit previously applied
solutions to invent new strategies and to behave flexibly. We examined the role of
experience on cognitive flexibility to innovate and to find new problem-solving
solutions with an artificial feeding task in wild redfronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons). Four groups of lemurs were tested
with feeding boxes, each offering three different techniques to extract food, with
only one technique being available at a time. After the subjects learned a
technique, this solution was no longer successful and subjects had to invent a new
technique. For the first transition between task 1 and 2, subjects had to rely on
their experience of the previous technique to solve task 2. For the second
transition, subjects had to inhibit the previously learned technique to learn the
new task 3. Tasks 1 and 2 were solved by most subjects, whereas task 3 was solved by
only a few subjects. In this task, besides behavioral flexibility, especially
persistence, i.e., constant trying, was important for individual success during
innovation. Thus, wild strepsirrhine primates are able to innovate flexibly,
suggesting a general ecological relevance of behavioral flexibility and persistence
during innovation and problem solving across all primates.

Introduction
 The ability to innovate and to find new problem-solving strategies can have
important fitness consequences for animals. More innovative individuals or species
enhance their ability to exploit new resources, or to use existing resources more
efficiently. They may even invade or create new niches or survive the invasion of
another species (Kummer and Goodall 1985; Laland et al. 1996; Reader and Laland 2003; Sol et al. 2005;
Ramsey et al. 2007; Morand-Ferron and
Quinn 2011). For example, innovative
anti-predator responses against novel predators (Berger et al. 2001) and adjusted breeding behaviors help animals
to survive in changing ecological conditions (Brooke et al. 1998).

Animal innovation has been defined as “a solution to a novel problem or a novel
solution to an old problem” (Kummer and Goodall 1985, p. 205). Innovation can also be considered as a process that
results in a new or modified learned behavior, leading to the introduction of novel
behavioral variants into the behavioral repertoire of a population (Reader and
Laland 2003). Until today, research on
innovation and problem solving has mainly focused on analyzing anecdotal accounts
from the literature (e.g., Nicolakakis et al. 2003; Reader and Laland 2003), or innovations were elicited by presenting novel problems to
captive animals (e.g., Köhler 1925;
Visalberghi et al. 1995; Heinrich and
Bugnyar 2005; Bond et al. 2007; Liker and Bókony 2009; Manrique et al. 2013).

Observational studies of innovations in the field are rare, as innovations are
scarce and unpredictable (e.g., Gajdon et al. 2006; Turner et al. 2012; Schnoell and Fichtel 2013). Moreover, in order to recognize a behavior as an innovation,
long-term behavioral observations are required, complicating field studies even more
(van Schaik et al. 2006). However, a
few studies have successfully implemented an experimental approach to study
innovations in animals in their natural environment (birds: Webster and Lefebvre
2001; Bouchard et al. 2007; Boogert et al. 2010; Morand-Ferron and Quinn 2011; Morand-Ferron et al. 2011; mammals: Biro et al. 2003; Benson-Amram and Holekamp 2012; Thornton and Samson 2012). In contrast to studies on captive animals, which mainly
tested separated animals with novel problem-solving tasks (e.g., Manrique et al.
2013), field experiments have the
potential to provide more insights into the factors that drive innovation in nature
as an entire free-ranging social group can be tested (Ramsey et al. 2007; Reader and Biro 2010).

Recent research revealed that various factors influence problem-solving
abilities and behavioral plasticity (Kappeler et al. 2013; Snell-Rood 2013). Innovation rates were found to be a useful tool to quantify
species differences in cognition and behavioral flexibility in birds (Lefebvre et
al. 1997, 1998; Lefebvre 2000) and primates (Reader and Laland 2002). These studies revealed that innovation
rates correlate with relative brain size in both taxa, with more innovative species
having enlarged associative brain areas (Lefebvre et al. 1997, 2004; Timmermans et al. 2000; Reader and Laland 2002). Perceptual and learning differences may also influence
innovation rates, with individuals that are able to perceive the causal structure of
a problem or to generalize across different problems being more likely to innovate
(Day et al. 2003).

Also, within-species differences in innovation rates exist. Various factors such
as sex, age and social status (Reader and Laland 2001) and also individual characteristics such as personality and
internal states play an important role in innovation and learning of new
problem-solving strategies (Lefebvre 2000; Lewis 2002;
Reader et al. 2011, reviewed in Brosnan
and Hopper 2014). For example,
exploration and novelty responses as well as constant trying are important
behavioral processes during innovation in a range of species (e.g., Laland and
Reader 1999; Webster and Lefebvre
2001; Day et al. 2003; Greenberg 2003; Tebbich et al. 2009, 2010; Cole et
al. 2011; Thornton and Samson
2012; Benson-Amram and Holekamp
2012).

Finally, prior knowledge plays an important role in an animal’s ability to
innovate and to solve problems (e.g., Köhler 1925; Epstein et al. 1984; Manrique et al. 2013). Prior experience with objects and their structural
propensities can facilitate problem solving (e.g., Birch 1945), and already shaped behaviors can lead to
novel solutions by an automatic chaining process (Epstein et al. 1984; Epstein 1987). However, in “finding a novel solution to an old problem”
cases of innovation, prior knowledge might also hinder an animal to innovate. Here,
prior knowledge could produce mental blockages, like functional fixedness, when
objects like tools have fixed functions gained by past experience, which in turn
hinders novel usage (Duncker and Lees 1945; Hanus et al. 2011). Before a novel solution can be found, old, previously
learned solutions have to be inhibited, making these kinds of tasks particularly
difficult (Manrique et al. 2013).
Several studies on great apes have reported this form of conservatism, i.e., animals
have problems or are reluctant to explore alternative solutions and techniques after
having successfully mastered a particular technique or solution (e.g.,
Marshall-Pescini and Whiten 2008;
Gruber et al. 2011; Hanus et al.
2011). For example, chimpanzees
(Pan troglodytes) that had become proficient
with a specific technique to acquire food were reluctant to switch to an alternative
technique, even though they knew that the other technique was available and more
efficient (Hrubesch et al. 2009). Three
subjects even stayed with their learned and specialized technique after it was made
ineffective, demonstrating pronounced conservatism (Hrubesch et al. 2009).

Similarly, keas (Nestor notabilis) and New
Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) were
confronted with a multi-access feeding box, containing four different techniques to
extract food (Auersperg et al. 2011).
Once a subject had learned a specific technique, this technique was blocked and it
had to abandon the old solution and to learn a new solution to the same problem.
Only one subject of each species demonstrated such high behavioral flexibility and
mastered all four tasks. Great apes confronted with a similar food extraction task,
for which they had to learn different solutions in subsequent trials, were able to
adjust their behavior flexibly and showed high degrees of inhibitory control during
innovation (Manrique et al. 2013). Only
orangutans (Pongo abelli) did not solve the third
task.

However, studies of free-ranging animals focusing on innovation and behavioral
flexibility during multiple problem solving are still missing. Moreover, studies on
innovation in captive animals may suffer from low external validity because
by-products of a captive lifestyle, for example reduced neophobia toward human
objects, may influence innovation rates (Webster and Lefebvre 2001; Ramsey et al. 2007). Interestingly, comparisons between captive and wild animals
of the same species found that captive animals had better technical problem-solving
abilities, resulting in higher innovation rates (birds: Webster and Lefebvre
2001; Gajdon et al. 2004; Bouchard et al. 2007; hyenas: Benson-Amram et al. 2012). Therefore, observing innovation rates and
problem-solving abilities as well as testing associated behavioral flexibility in
wild animals can help understand the importance of innovations in a species’ natural
habitat.

In this study, we tested behavioral flexibility to innovate and to find new
problem-solving techniques with an artificial feeding task in wild redfronted lemurs
(Eulemur rufifrons). Lemurs are interesting
subjects for understanding the evolution of primate cognition for several reasons.
First, lemurs and other strepsirrhine primates are phylogenetically the most basal
living primates (Fichtel and Kappeler 2010). Furthermore, lemurs innovate in the wild [e.g., ringtailed
lemurs (Lemur catta): Kendal et al. 2010, redfronted lemurs: Schnoell and Fichtel
2012, 2013]. Moreover, studies with captive brown and black lemurs
(Eulemur fulvus and Eulemur macaco) showed that they are in principle capable of
self-control (Genty et al. 2004; Glady
et al. 2012). Thus, lemurs exhibit the
necessary cognitive abilities (innovation and inhibitory control) required for this
study.

Redfronted lemurs were able to solve a two-option feeding box task (Schnoell and
Fichtel 2012) and spontaneously
innovated a new foraging technique in the wild (Schnoell and Fichtel 2013). Furthermore, a recent social diffusion
experiment with the same groups of redfronted lemurs participating in the present
study examined long-term behavioral preferences for one of the two possible
techniques to open a feeding box (Schnoell et al. 2014). Some individuals developed a stable preference for one
technique over at least two consecutive years, which is indicative of conservative
behavior. However, other subjects switched between having a preference for one
technique or no preference (Schnoell et al. 2014). These findings indicate that individual differences in the
degree of conservatism and behavioral flexibility exist when subjects can freely
choose between techniques and when both techniques are equally difficult and
rewarding. Thus, the aim of this study was to test the role of prior knowledge on
lemurs’ problem-solving abilities and innovativeness.

Specifically, we tested whether lemurs are also able to learn a new food
extracting technique after they learned to apply a previous, now obsolete technique
efficiently. To this end, redfronted lemurs were provided with a feeding box
offering three different techniques to open it and to extract a reward. For the
first transition between techniques, subjects had to extend the previously learned
solution; therefore, we predicted that the previously acquired knowledge and
experience with the task would facilitate subjects’ learning. In contrast, during
the second transition from task 2–3, prior knowledge was not helpful but supposedly
hindering as now the previous technique was unsuccessful as animals were presented
with a totally new problem. Thus, subjects had to inhibit the previously successful
solution in order to learn a new, more difficult technique, requiring cognitive
flexibility and inhibitory control during innovation and problem solving.

Methods
Study site and subjects
The study was conducted at the research station of the German Primate Center
in Kirindy Forest, a dry deciduous forest located about 60 km north of Morondava
in Western Madagascar (Kappeler and Fichtel 2012a). The study site is managed within a 12,500 ha forestry
concession operated by the Centre National de Formation, d’Etude et de Recherche
en Environnement et Foresterie (CNFEREF), Morondava. Data collection proceeded at
the beginning of the dry season from mid-May until mid-August 2013. The
experiments were conducted with four groups of redfronted lemurs (group A, B, F,
J), ranging in size from 5 to 10 individuals. In total, 29 individuals were tested
in the experiments: 23 of which interacted with the boxes in all three
experimental tasks, three individuals participated only in one or two tasks, one
individual disappeared after participating in task 2, and two individuals never
interacted with the boxes. All subjects were well habituated to the presence of
humans and individually marked with combinations of nylon collars and pendants or
radio collars. Due to previous studies on social learning (Schnoell and Fichtel
2012; Schnoell et al. 2014), lemurs were familiar with the general
experimental procedure, i.e., artificial feeding boxes, and highly motivated to
extract food rewards, but naïve to the specific experimental apparatuses presented
in this study.

Apparatus
The experimental apparatus consisted of a wooden feeding box (measures
28 × 28 × 10 cm) offering three different techniques to obtain a reward with only
one technique available at a time (Fig. 1). Boxes were baited with raisins and pieces of oranges, which
subjects could only smell before opening. Techniques in the three test conditions
differed in difficulty and required gradually more demanding manipulative tactics
to extract the rewards.Fig. 1 Feeding boxes with the respective techniques for the three
tasks. 1 Task 1: pull technique,
2 task 2: pull-slide technique and
3 task 3: pull-raise
technique




In all three tasks, subjects needed to open a lid to reach the food reward via
the same opening in the box (measures 10 × 10 cm). In task 1, subjects had to open
a covering lid by pulling it (pull technique; see video Online Resource 1). The
lid was constructed in such a way that animals had to hold the lid so that it did
not fall back. In this way, boxes were available for multiple opening trials
without necessarily being baited again and scrounging by other animals was
hampered. Task 2 (pull-slide technique) required the use of both hands, one hand
to pull the lid open (like in task 1), the other to slide an extra wooden board to
the left side (see video Online Resource 2). For task 3 (pull-raise technique),
the subjects again needed to pull the lid open, but now an extra wooden board had
to be raised to the right with the other hand from outside of the box opening (see
video Online Resource 3). This technique was more difficult to learn via
trial-and-error than the other techniques because subjects could not simply use
the smell of the reward as a cue for manipulation. As only one female subject
succeeded in this task (in the following named T3a), we slightly modified it after
the first 10 sessions. Now (T3b), the lid remained open after a subject
successfully pulled it open, and subjects could use both hands to raise the board
to the right.

Procedure
Each group was tested with six feeding boxes simultaneously in order to
prevent monopolization of boxes by a few animals as this could often be observed
when a whole group of lemurs was tested (e.g., Fornasieri et al. 1990; Anderson et al. 1992; Schnoell and Fichtel 2012). The baiting of boxes took place out of
sight of the lemurs to avoid the association of humans with food. Boxes were
placed in open areas in the forest before the respective group was attracted with
a clicker noise. Testing took place in the morning between 8:00 and 11:00 a.m. and
in the afternoon between 01:30 and 5:00 p.m. Each group was tested once or twice
per day in a randomized order with at least 3 h between experiments with the same
group. A session began when the first subject entered the 7-m radius around the
boxes and ended when subjects did not contact the boxes for 4 min or the last
subject left the 7-m radius. During a session, we performed scans every second
minute. In order to control for influences of social learning, positions of all
individuals within a 7 m radius of the boxes were noted as well as whether they
observed other subjects opening boxes, i.e., the subject’s head was turned toward
another individual manipulating a box.

At the beginning of data collection, the boxes could be opened with the pull
technique. After 20 sessions, the boxes were changed so that the pull-slide
technique was necessary to obtain the reward for the next 20 sessions with each
group. Subsequently, the pull-raise technique was tested for 30 sessions in total,
10 sessions with task 3a and another 20 sessions with task 3b.

Data scoring and analyses
All test sessions were video-taped from different angles with two video
cameras. We determined the number of successful trials, i.e., successful opening
of the box with the respective technique, for all subjects in the three test
conditions. Moreover, individuals’ contacts with the boxes and the different kinds
of unsuccessful task manipulations were counted. To compare the general
participation of subjects in the different tasks and in the course of sessions
within a task, we conducted a GLM with task and session as fixed factors. We
classified subjects as juveniles (up to 2.5 years) or adults (more than 2.5 years)
(Kappeler and Fichtel 2012b). To test
for sex and age effects on performance, we conducted proportion tests. To control
for the potential influence of social learning in successful subjects, we divided
the number of scans a subject observed others manipulating the box by the total
number of scans of an individual. To determine whether this rate of observing
others influenced the number of trials a subject needed until the first success,
we conducted a Spearman’s rank correlation.

To determine whether the proportion of successful subjects differed between
the test conditions, i.e., between the different tasks, we conducted a Cochran
Q test for all tasks and a McNemar test for
pairwise comparisons. For analyzing how fast subjects learned a technique, we
recorded for each task the number of unsuccessful trials (manipulation of the box
with nose or hands) until a subject successfully opened the feeding box for the
first time. The efficiency of each successful individual in retrieving a reward
was calculated by dividing the number of successful trials by the number of total
trials manipulating functional parts of the boxes in a given test condition. For
the analysis of the unsuccessful trials until a subject’s first success and the
efficiency of subjects, we conducted Friedman rank sum tests for successful
individuals in all three test conditions and pairwise comparisons with a signed
Wilcoxon matched pairs test.

For the analysis of the transition between tasks and techniques, we noted for
every unsuccessful trial the specific technique that was applied. In this way, it
was possible to investigate for how many trials and sessions subjects continued to
use the previously learned technique after test conditions changed. In task 2,
this previous technique was pulling the first lid open without further
manipulation of the box. In task 3, subjects’ attempts to slide the wooden board
to the left were counted as previous technique. For task 3, the number of trials
with the previous technique (T2) in Task 3a and Task 3b was added up and square
root transformed to calculate a generalized linear model (GLM) with task and
session as fixed factors. To compare the number of these “previous technique
attempts” in task 3 between successful and unsuccessful subjects that had learned
to open the boxes in task 1 and task 2, and to compare the total number of
unsuccessful trials in task 3 in these subjects, we performed Mann–Whitney
U tests.

To analyze the explorative behavior of subjects, we calculated an exploration
diversity (ED) score for each subject in each task. For these scores, we counted
the number of different behaviors subjects exhibited when interacting with the
boxes. For task 1, up to three different behaviors were observed: contacting the
boxes, manipulating nonfunctional parts of the boxes, and pulling the lid. For
task 2, the same three behaviors were observed as well as manipulating the wooden
board as an additional behavior resulting in the highest possible ED score of 4.
In task 3, additively manipulating the outer aspect of the wooden board (that was
outside of the box opening; see Fig. 1)
was counted, resulting in five possible behaviors for this task. For the
comparison of ED scores between successful and unsuccessful subjects in each task,
we conducted a Mann–Whitney U test. We compared
ED scores between tasks by using a Friedman rank sum test with additional pairwise
comparisons via Wilcoxon matched pairs test. For all three tasks, successful task
manipulations in 10 % of test sessions were independently scored by a second
observer (total N of 28 sessions, randomly
selected) to assess inter-observer reliability, which was excellent (intra-class
correlation coefficient = 0.98). Statistical tests were conducted using R 2.15.1
and SPSS.

Results
General participation and effects of subjects’ age and sex on innovation
success
In total, 27 out of 29 individuals of the four groups contacted the feeding
boxes at least once; two subjects were repeatedly in sight of the boxes but never
touched them. On average, progressively fewer individuals contacted the feeding
boxes from task 1 to task 3b, with significantly fewer individuals contacting the
boxes in task 3b compared with 2 (GLM, df = 5,
P < 0.05; Fig. 2; Table 1). Session in
general had no influence on the number of subjects contacting the feeding boxes,
but there was a significant interaction of task 1 with session; more individuals
contacted the boxes over the course of the 20 sessions of task 1. Only adult
individuals solved the tasks and successfully opened the feeding boxes, whereas
the seven juveniles contacted the boxes but failed to open them [Proportion test,
N (juveniles) = 7, N (adults) = 22, χ
2 = 7.344, P = 0.007]. Females tended to be more likely to successfully open the
boxes, but this effect was not statistically significant (Table 2).Fig. 2 Number of individuals that contacted the boxes for all sessions

Social learning control
The rate of observing other individuals manipulating the box until a subject’s
first success was not correlated with the number of unsuccessful trials an animal
made until its first success in all three tasks (Spearman’s rank correlation: T1:
N = 15, ρ = 0.061, P = 0.828; T2: N = 14, ρ = 0.019,
P = 0.949; T3b: N = 7, ρ = 0.427, P = 0.399). Therefore, independent of test condition,
subjects that observed other conspecifics opening the box were not faster in
learning a technique.

Performance in the different tasks
In task 1, 15 subjects successfully opened the boxes [mean number of
successful trials = 126.8 ± 110.49 (SD); Online Resource 5], and subjects
succeeded after 1.53 ± 2 (mean ± SD) unsuccessful attempts. Task 2 was
successfully solved by 14 individuals (mean number of successful
trials = 158.571 ± 116.27); only one individual that solved task 1 was not
successful in task 2 (for a general overview of the performance of subjects see
Online Resource 5). Subjects tried on average 3.43 ± 4.55 times unsuccessfully to
manipulate the boxes before their first success. In task 3a, only one subject
successfully opened the boxes [N (successful
trials) = 77, N (unsuccessful trails) = 15].
Subjects that were later successful in T3b (N = 6) tried this task (T3a) on average 87.5 ± 40.09 times
unsuccessfully. In the last task 3b, seven individuals were able to extract food
out of the boxes (mean number of successful trials = 131.14 ± 92.2). Here,
individuals opened the boxes by applying two different techniques: two subjects
opened the feeding boxes preferentially in the “correct” way (as described in the
methods; T3) and raised the wooden board to the right from outside of the box
opening. Five subjects found another way and slid the wooden board inside the box
opening to the right (in the following referred to as “alternative” technique; see
video Online Resource 4). Among the two subjects that opened the boxes with the
“correct” technique, one individual also discovered the “alternative” technique
but preferentially used the “correct” technique. Of the five subjects that opened
the boxes with the “alternative” technique, two subjects also discovered the
“correct” technique but used the “alternative” technique more often (Online
Resource 5). In this task, subjects tried 28.71 ± 17.42 times unsuccessfully to
obtain access to the reward before their first success.

Overall, the number of successful individuals varied between tasks (Cochrans
Q test: T1–T2–T3: N = 28, Q = 12.286, df = 2, P = 0.002).
Pairwise comparisons revealed that the number of individuals that succeeded did
not vary between task 1 and 2, but between task 2 and 3 with fewer individuals
being able to open the boxes in task 3 (McNemar test, T1–T2: N = 28, P = 1,
T2–T3: N = 28, P = 0.031).

Differences between tasks in problem-solving abilities and
innovation
Among successful subjects, the number of unsuccessful trials performed before
the first successful opening differed significantly between tasks (Friedman rank
sum test, N = 7, Q = 7, P = 0.03). However,
pairwise comparisons between tasks revealed that there was no difference in the
number of unsuccessful trials between T1 and T2 (Wilcoxon matched pairs test,
N = 14, T = 23.5, P = 0.422) as well as
between T2 and T3b (N = 7, T = 3, P = 0.075)
but between T1 and T3b (N = 7, T = 3, P = 0.036;
Fig. 3).Fig. 3 Number of unsuccessful trials until the first success in all
three tasks (N = 7). Represented are
median (black bars), interquartile
range (boxes), upper and lower hinge
(whiskers) and outliers (circles). Asterisks indicate significant differences with *P < 0.05




The efficiency of successful subjects differed in the three different tasks
significantly (Friedman rank sum test, N = 7,
Q = 12.29, P = 0.002). Pairwise comparisons of efficiency between tasks
revealed that individuals were more efficient in task 2 than in task 1 or in task
3 [Wilcoxon matched pairs test: T1–T2: N = 14,
T = 17, P = 0.025, efficiency (mean ± SD): T1 = 0.72 ± 0.07, T2 = 0.81 ± 0.15;
T2–T3b: N = 7, T = 28, P = 0.016, efficiency:
T2 = 0.82 ± 0.09, T3b = 0.28 ± 0.16].

During the transition from task 1 to task 2, lemurs tried on average
2.36 ± 3.6 (SD) times unsuccessfully to open the boxes before their first success.
Successful subjects applied on average 1.07 ± 1.44 times only the pull technique
that was successful in task 1 before they began to further manipulate the boxes.
In task 3, (a and b) successful subjects tried on average 10.28 ± 8.35 times to
apply the previously rewarded technique of task 2 before their first successful
trial.

Lemurs performed on average significantly more unsuccessful trials with the
previous technique in task 3a (next task after task 2) than in task 3b [task 3a:
12.9 ± 13.98 (mean ± SD), task 3b: 2.15 ± 3.23, GLM, P < 0.001; Table 1].
There was also a significant interaction between session and the number of trials
with the previous technique: While subjects applied the previous technique in the
beginning of testing with task 3a and b extensively, this tendency decreased
significantly across subsequent sessions (GLM, T3a: P < 0.001, T3b: P < 0.001;
Table 1).

How do successful subjects in task 3 differ from unsuccessful
ones?
The number of attempts with the previous technique did not differ between
subjects that did succeed in task 3 and subjects that did not succeed but solved
task 1 and 2 (T3 total: Mann–Whitney U test:
N = 13, Z = 14.5, P = 0.39,
Fig. 4). However, the total number of
unsuccessful task manipulations was significantly higher in subjects that mastered
task 3 (T3 total: Mann–Whitney U test:
N = 13, Z = 2, P = 0.005, Fig. 4). Thus, subjects that tried more often, even
without success, were more likely to solve the task.Fig. 4 Comparison of successful subjects in task 3 (N = 7) and subjects that solved task 1 and 2
but failed to solve task 3 (N = 6) with
respect to a the number of trials in
which they applied the previously successful technique and b the total number of unsuccessful task
manipulations during task 3. Represented are median (black bars), interquartile range (boxes), upper and lower hinge (whiskers) and outliers (circles). Asterisks
indicate significant differences with **P < 0.01




Successful individuals had a higher exploration diversity score for each task
than unsuccessful individuals (Mann–Whitney U
test: T1: N = 29, Z = 195, P < 0.001; T2:
N = 29, Z = 203, P < 0.001; T3b:
N = 28, Z = 126, P = 0.003). Successful
subjects always had the highest possible exploration diversity score in each task.
Finally, the exploration diversity scores of subjects that did not manage to open
boxes in any task did not differ significantly between the three tasks even though
different maximum scores were possible (Friedman rank sum test, T1–T2–T3 total:
N = 14, Q = 4.73, P = 0.094).

Discussion
This study revealed that wild redfronted lemurs are capable of multiple
innovations when presented with a novel feeding task, offering three different
solutions to extract a reward with only one solution being successful at a time.
Thus, redfronted lemurs are able to adjust their behavior flexibly to task
constraints and build on (task 2) or abandon (task 3) previously learned
problem-solving strategies after solutions are no longer successful, demonstrating
behavioral flexibility and inhibitory control. Interestingly, in the most difficult
test condition, successful and unsuccessful subjects did not differ in their degrees
of conservatism, but in the total number of unsuccessful trials and thus in their
persistence to manipulate the boxes. Thus, not only behavioral flexibility but also
persistence is a relevant feature during flexible innovations in these wild
lemurs.

Also, a subject’s general interest in the novel object or task was an important
prerequisite for solving the presented problems. In general, neophobia may hamper
innovation (e.g., Webster and Lefebvre 2001; Day et al. 2003;
Greenberg 2003; Auersperg et al.
2011; Overington et al. 2011). In this study, only two subjects showed
high levels of neophobia and never approached the boxes. During the course of
testing, the number of subjects that contacted the feeding boxes successively
increased during task 1 sessions, suggesting that familiarity with the set-up
reduced neophobia in the course of testing. As tasks became more difficult, the
number of animals interacting with the boxes decreased, however. Since the lemurs
participated voluntarily and were therefore able to avoid the “problem” altogether,
the decreasing number of participating animals during task 1 to task 3 may indicate
that some individuals had limited behavioral flexibility, remaining unsuccessful and
becoming less motivated when tasks became more difficult.

Influence of sex, age and social learning
In the current study, female and male subjects were equally likely to succeed
in opening the boxes, i.e., to innovate, with a slight bias toward females.
Previous studies on the acquisition of problem-solving techniques in lemurs showed
that females were more likely to innovate (Kappeler 1987; Dean et al. 2011; Schnoell and Fichtel 2012). A significant lack of a sex difference during innovation
could be found in chimpanzees (Hrubesch et al. 2009) and hyenas (Crocuta
crocuta: Benson-Amram and Holekamp 2012), but other studies in haplorrhine primates suggested a male
bias (Reader and Laland 2001),
indicating that sex alone is a weak predictor of innovativeness.

In contrast, subjects’ age affected their innovativeness as only adult
redfronted lemurs were able to solve the different tasks. Since innovations
require experience and skills, they are more likely to be found in adult
individuals (Reader and Laland 2001).
Conversely, during a social learning experiment with the same study population,
innovators (N = 4) were individuals of less
than 2 years (Schnoell and Fichtel 2012). Moreover, anecdotal reports suggested that younger
individuals were more likely to innovate (Kummer 1971; Kummer and Goodall 1985; Hauser 1988).
In the current study, juvenile subjects were generally interested in the feeding
boxes and contacted them frequently by licking and sitting on them. However, with
few exceptions, they did not manipulate boxes and thus did not learn to open them.
Because older subjects already had experience with artificial feeding boxes from
earlier studies (Schnoell and Fichtel 2012; Schnoell et al. 2014), this experience might have facilitated the adults’
problem-solving abilities.

Since lemurs were tested as a group in the wild, social learning might have
influenced individual success. Although redfronted lemurs were shown to be able to
learn socially (Schnoell and Fichtel 2012), they did not seem to use social information to open the
boxes in the current study. Still, a general interest in the boxes might have been
facilitated by stimulus or local enhancement (reviewed in Hoppitt and Laland
2008), which was not further tested
here.

Influence of previous knowledge, persistence and exploration on
innovation
The first task in our study represented the basic problem that was given to
the subjects, and the technique lemurs learned here was necessary to extract food
rewards in all three tasks. Task 1 and task 2 were learned by most of the subjects
(68 and 64 % of adult subjects, respectively). The number of unsuccessful trials
until first success as a measure of difficulty and effort needed to extract a food
reward was low in both tasks, and also efficiency in extracting rewards was high
in task 1 and even higher in task 2. Thus, successful subjects learned task 1 and
task 2 equally easily and fast, even though task 2 was more difficult, as subjects
had to use both hands and perform different hand movements with each hand to open
the boxes. In task 2, subjects did not need to inhibit the previously learned
solution but to extend it, i.e., they added the new technique that was now
necessary. Therefore, in task 2, lemurs presumably benefited from previous
knowledge and experience and were able to learn the task quickly (see also Köhler
1925; Epstein et al. 1984; Kummer and Goodall 1985; Russon et al. 2010). Similarly, only individuals that had some
experience with a certain technique were able to invent a cognitively more
demanding but related technique in apes (Manrique et al. 2013). This flexibility in problem solving may
result from a potential cumulative buildup of technology during individual
learning (Lehner et al. 2011;
Manrique et al. 2013).

In contrast, task 3 required a new problem-solving strategy at the same
feeding boxes, i.e., a novel solution to an old problem. To solve this problem,
subjects had to inhibit and abandon the previous technique in favor of a new and
different technique. The difficulty of inhibiting a learned technique and learning
a new one was reflected by the significantly smaller number of animals that solved
this task. Moreover, subjects were less efficient in retrieving the rewards in
this task than in task 2 and needed significantly more unsuccessful trials until
they solved task 3 for the first time. However, the lemurs’ difficulties also
reflect the generally more complex method required here; in the third task, the
animals had to raise the wooden board from outside of the food entrance and could
not simply follow the smell of the rewards during manipulation, presumably
hampering trial-and-error learning.

Successful, flexibly innovating subjects in task 3 performed significantly
more unsuccessful manipulations than subjects that failed to solve task 3. Even
though subjects were not rewarded during all these unsuccessful attempts, they
continued trying, demonstrating high degrees of persistence, despite occasional
signs of frustration like biting the boxes. This biting could only be observed
during unsuccessful manipulations of task 3 in 5 out of the 7 successful subjects.
Persistence was already shown to influence innovation and problem-solving
abilities in birds and other mammals [e.g., great tits (Parus major): Cole and Quinn 2012, keas: Gajdon et al. 2006, Carib grackles (Quiscalus
lugubris): Overington et al. 2011, meerkats (Suricata
suricatta): Thornton and Samson 2012, spotted hyenas: Benson-Amram and Holekamp 2012] and was found to be a consistent
personality trait in chimpanzees (Massen et al. 2013).

In contrast, extreme forms of persistence, i.e., perseveration as a result of
inhibitory problems (Hauser 1999),
can also harm an animal’s ability to solve a problem, which often is the case when
a new solution to an old problem must be found. Here, conservatism, reflected in
perseverative errors subjects perform when repeating the same action over and over
despite not being rewarded, prevents subjects from finding a novel solution.
Animals stick to the solution they have initially learned even though an
alternative technique might be more efficient. In chimpanzees, for example,
subjects had difficulties in learning a second, more efficient technique to
extract a food reward after they successfully learned a first one
(Marshall-Pescini and Whiten 2008;
Hrubesch et al. 2009; Gruber et al.
2011). In the study of Hrubesch et
al. (2009), all three male
chimpanzees that became specialists in a technique continued using this first
technique even after it was made ineffective. In contrast, out of 14 redfronted
lemurs that learned the technique required for task 2, seven were able to learn
the successful technique in task 3. Thus, mastering a skill did not inhibit lemurs
from learning a new technique, even though subjects exhibited perseverative errors
in the beginning.

In great apes that had to invent a new strategy when a previously successful
technique became ineffective, individuals that discovered the third, most
difficult technique performed fewer errors with the previous technique than
individuals that did not discover it, suggesting that individual conservatism may
inhibit discovery and mastery of a skill in unsuccessful individuals (Manrique et
al. 2013). However, in redfronted
lemurs, successful and unsuccessful individuals did not differ in the number of
perseverative errors. Although successful lemurs were conservative in the
beginning of a new task, they succeeded in overcoming the predisposition for the
old technique by being more persistent. Our findings therefore support the notion
that not only behavioral flexibility plays a major role when finding a new
solution to an old problem, but that also persistence and motivation are important
prerequisites for success.

Interestingly, in task 3, successful subjects found two different ways to
extract food rewards, with the majority of subjects applying efficiently the
“alternative” technique, which was more similar to the previously learned
technique in task 2. When applying the “alternative” technique, subjects
manipulated the same parts of the box as in task 1 and 2 and basically applied the
same technique as in task 2 (sliding) but in the other direction. Learning this
new technique was therefore probably easier and required less behavioral
flexibility. However, subjects had to exert much more strength to open the boxes
with this technique compared with the “correct” technique, as no handle was
available to open the boxes at this position. Thus, subjects that discovered this
technique must have been very persistent and nimble. However, four subjects also
applied the “correct” technique and were able to invent a totally new method to
open the boxes.

Subjects also varied in the way they contacted the boxes, as reflected by the
exploration scores of successful and unsuccessful individuals. Exploration scores
of unsuccessful individuals were lower in all three tasks. Whereas unsuccessful
individuals did not further explore the boxes, successful individuals had the
highest possible exploration scores, i.e., they fully explored the boxes even
though this was not mandatory to open them successfully. Thus, as in other
species, lemurs’ explorative behavior appears to correlate with innovation and
problem-solving abilities (Cole et al. 2011; Overington et al. 2011; Benson-Amram and Holekamp 2012).

Conclusions
This study revealed that not only captive great apes, keas and New Caledonian
crows, but also wild redfronted lemurs are able to innovate flexibly during problem
solving when task conditions change and previously learned solution become obsolete.
Besides behavioral flexibility, persistence, i.e., constant trying, was important
for individual success during innovation. Thus, even phylogenetically basal primates
are able to innovate flexibly, suggesting a general ecological relevance of
behavioral flexibility and persistence during innovation and problem solving across
all primates.
