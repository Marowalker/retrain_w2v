On the second to third pages of this article:

L1 mobilization of cellular mRNAs is responsible for ∼8,000–17,000 retrotransposed gene copies identified in the human genome reference sequence [24‐27, 68‐71]. Here, we will refer to any retrotransposed gene copy as a “retrocopy‘’. Retrocopies bear the hallmarks of L1‐mediated retrotransposition, including L1 endonuclease preference for the loose consensus sequence 5′‐TTTT/AA‐3′ [28], flanking target‐site duplications, and, as mature mRNAs are mobilized by the L1 machinery, retrocopies lack introns and contain a poly‐A tail [29, 30]. A promoter sequence is typically not delivered upon retrotransposition of a cellular mRNA; hence, most retrocopies are not expressed, and presumably lack functionality [29]. These retrocopies are known as processed pseudogenes. Occasionally, a retrocopy may insert into a genomic context permissive of its expression [31, 32‐33, 72, 73], giving rise to potentially functional transcripts. We will refer to such an insertion as a “retrogene”.

Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of retrotransposed gene copies in genome evolution and function. Protein‐coding retrogenes represent a significant contribution to the ongoing generation of new genes over evolutionary time [34‐36]. Gene retrocopies can also influence parent gene expression; for example, retrogene‐derived siRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate gene expression in mouse oocytes [37, 38, 74] and in the protozoan parasite T. brucei [39, 75]. An expressed pseudogene in mouse has also been demonstrated to regulate the mRNA stability of its homologous coding gene [36, 76], and retrogene mRNAs can compete with target gene transcripts for miRNA binding, acting as a molecular “sink” and interfering with miRNA‐mediated gene regulation [40, 77]. Although an instance of a retrocopy insertion associated with human disease has yet to be identified, expression of an FGF4 retrogene causes short‐legged chondrodysplasia in certain breeds of domestic dog [40, 78]. Conversely, retrocopy insertions have the potential to confer protection from infectious disease: in owl monkeys, a retrocopy of the Cyclophilin A cDNA into the TRIM5 gene confers resistance to HIV [32, 79].

On the sixth page of this article:

Although previous analyses indicate that genes highly expressed in a wide variety of tissues are more likely to give rise to novel retrocopies [61, 80], heritable retrotransposition events must take place in the germline (male or female), or in the early embryo prior to germline specification.
