Currently, four antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicine Agency to treat cancer patients. More than 60 ADCs are in clinical development for cancer therapy. More than 60% of ADCs in clinical trials employ microtubule inhibitors as their payloads. A better understanding of payloads other than microtubule inhibitors, especially DNA-damaging agents, is important for further development of ADCs. In this review, we highlight an emerging trend of using DNA-damaging agents as payloads for ADCs. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding gained from ongoing clinical studies; it will help to define the utility of DNA-damaging payloads for ADCs as cancer therapeutics. Future directions of the development of ADCs are also discussed, focusing on targeting drug resistance and combination treatment with immunotherapy.

Statement of Significance
More than 60 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are in clinical development, four are approved. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding gained from ongoing clinical studies and highlights an emerging trend of using DNA-damaging agents as payloads for ADCs.




INTRODUCTION
The modern origin of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) dates back to the ‘magic bullet’ proposal from Paul Ehrlich in the 1900s [1]. The same concept was also documented in Chinese traditional herbal medicine 2000 years before Ehrlich’s proposal. The Shennong (or Godly Farmer) reported a basic pharmacological philosophy: Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi (emperor, minister, assistant and guide) indicating the first consideration of different functions within a prescription. The jun (emperor) treats the major symptoms. The chen (minister) serves to boost the effects of jun and relieves secondary symptoms. The zuo (assistant) helps in modulating the effects of jun and chen, and to counteract the toxic or side effects of the herbs. The shi (guide) ensures that all components are delivered to the target(s). By this definition, ADCs are shi (antibody)-jun (drug)-zuo (conjugates) (Fig. 1). In the simplest form, ADCs are comprised of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to payloads (cytotoxic drugs). ADCs perfectly combine the high specificity of the antibodies with the strong potency of the payloads. The mechanism of action of ADCs can be summarized into three steps: (1) The ADCs recognize tumor antigen through antibody binding. (2) The target cell endocytoses the ADC-antigen complex. (3) The cytotoxic drug is released after lysosomal degradation of the ADC, which allows it to bind to its intracellular target (Fig. 1). In this way, payloads can be specifically delivered into target tumor cells by the antibody while minimizing undesired toxicity to normal cells [2].

To date, four ADCs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicine Agency: gemtuzumab ozogamicin (developed by Wyeth/Pfizer), inotuzumab ozogamicin (developed by Wyeth/Pfizer), brentuximab vedotin ADCs (developed by Seattle Genetics) and trastuzumab emtansine (developed by Roche). Currently, there are more than 60 ADCs in clinical trials, almost all for oncological indications. ADCs have been discussed extensively on the design for the next generation (e.g. choice of antibody, linker, drug and conjugation strategy) [3–9]. In this review, we will focus on a summary of the historical development of ADCs against cancer, using DNA-damaging agent as their payloads, and discuss new ideas in the field that can be applied to those ADCs. We believe there are two potential benefits of using DNA-damaging agent as the ADC payload: First, DNA-damaging agents (picomolar IC50 values) can provide higher potency than anti-microtubule payloads (sub-nanomolar IC50 values) and enable ADCs to target less abundant tumor antigens [10]. Secondly, they have the potential to kill non-dividing cancer stem cells in a combination with targeted agents directed against DNA repair effectors [11].

Figure 1 Proposed schematic of mechanism of action for ADCs: antigen binding, endocytosis, endosome formation, lysosome trafficking, lysosomal degradation and release of payload.

DNA-damaging agents as payloads of ADCs
One of the major hurdles for the development of the early ADCs (e.g. BR96-DOX) was the low potency of the payloads (e.g. doxorubicin only exhibits nanomolar activity in vitro) [1]. The current ADCs mainly employ two families of much more potent compounds as the payloads: microtubule inhibitors and DNA-damaging agents. Among the 60+ ADCs currently in clinical development, more than 60% utilize microtubule-targeting payloads (auristatins and maytansinoids); only 25 ADCs have DNA-damaging agent in their construct (Table 1). Microtubule-targeting agent-based ADCs have been reviewed elsewhere [12, 13]. There is a clear trend that the ADC field is moving towards treatments against solid tumors from liquid cancer [14–18]. We want to highlight that this trend may shift the choice of payload from microtubule-targeting agents to DNA-damaging agents, which usually exhibit higher potency.

Calicheamicins
Calicheamicin was identified in a search for new DNA-damaging agents in the 1980s. It was originally isolated from the bacterium Micromonospora echinospora. The calicheamicins were recognized as the most potent antitumor agents ever discovered [19]. Calicheamicin γ1I is the most promising member of this family, which is also used to construct ADCs. The mechanism of action is summarized in Figure 2A. In brief, the methyl trisulfide undergoes reductive bond cleavage by intracellular reducing components (e.g. glutathione). After spontaneous cyclization and Bergman cycloaromatization, 1,4-dehydrobenzene diradicals are generated, which subsequently form abstract hydrogen atoms from DNA, resulting in a double-strand diradical. In the presence of oxygen, DNA double strands are cleaved, followed by cell death. N-acetyl-calicheamicin γ1I was chosen as the payload of ADCs because it is more stable than the calicheamicin γ1I [20]. In total, there are five ADCs [Gemtuzumab ozogamicin/Mylotarg [21], Inotuzumab ozogamicin/CMC-544 [22], PF-06647263 [23], CMD-193 [24] and CMB-401 [25]] employing calicheamicin as their payload currently being tested in clinical trials; two are approved by the FDA. The most recent ADC advanced to clinical trial is PF-06647263, an anti-Ephrin-A4 ADC used to treat triple-negative breast cancer. The results of the phase I trial of PF-06647263 suggest that it is well tolerated, but no objective responses were observed in this trial [23].

Pyrrolobenzodiazepines
In the 1960s, pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) monomers were isolated from Streptomyces bacteria. They were found to have highly potent antibiotic and antitumor activity. PBDs react through the N10-C11 imine/carbinolamine functionality with the amino group in C2 position of guanine residue to form a DNA adduct (Fig. 2B) [26]. To explore the sequence binding selectivity of PBD, Thurston et al. linked two PBDs to form a PBD dimer through a propyldioxy ether linker. It resulted in 600 times more potency in vitro, which makes the PBD dimer an attractive payload for ADCs. There are 13 ADCs [Vadastuximab talirine/SGN-CD33A [27–29],SGN-CD70A [30], SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A [31], SGN-CD352A [32], Rovalpituzumab tesirine/Rova-T [33–35], ADCT-301/HuMax-TAC-PBD [36], ADCT-402 [37], MEDI3726/ADC-401, IMGN779 [38], IMGN632 [39], SC-002 and SC-003] with PBD payloads currently being tested in clinical trials. There are two possible reasons that make PBDs the most prominent class of DNA-damaging payloads: (1) PBDs have picomolar activity in vitro and demonstrated therapeutic index in clinic [40]. (2) PBDs can avoid multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)-mediated drug resistance [41].

Duocarmycins
The duocarmycins were originally isolated from Streptomyces zelensis in the late 1970s. They consist of a series of three connected pyrroloindole subunits with one having an unprecedented spirocyclic cyclopropapyrroloindole (CPI) moiety. The mechanism of action is through the formation of DNA adducts (Fig. 2C): N3 of adenine attacks the cyclopropane moiety at the least substituted carbon atom; the alkylation ultimately leads to cell death [41]. The CPI moiety could be derivatized in its ring-open chloromethyl form in the phenolic state. This change allows the preparation of a variety of prodrugs that are currently used in ADCs. The structure was further modified by Boger and his colleagues to produce a more accessible version with equal potency and a more stable cyclopropabenzindole moiety [41]. There are two duocarmycin-ADCs [Trastuzumab duocarmazine/SYD985 [42] and BMS-936561/MDX-1203 [43]] tested in clinical trials.

Camptothecin analogues
Camptothecin was first isolated from the Chinese ornamental tree Camptothecaacuminata in the 1980s. It is a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor with potent anticancer activity. Irinotecan (Camptothecin-11, CPT-11) is a semisynthetic analog of camptothecin that was approved by the FDA in 1996. The two analogues of camptothecin used as payloads for ADCs are SN38 and DX-8951f (also known as exatecan mesylate). SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, is approximately 1000 times more potent than its mother compound [44]. Compared to SN38, DX-8951f is a more water-soluble camptothecin analog [45]. An advantage is that DX-8951f is not an MDR1 substrate [46, 47]. Four ADCs [Sacituzumab govitecan/IMMU-132 [48], designated as a breakthrough therapy by the FDA; Labetuzumab govitecan/IMMU-130 [49]; DS-8201a [50] and U3-1402 [51]] that employed camptothecin analogues as their payload are being tested in clinical trials.

Doxorubicin
Doxorubicin (also known as Adriamycin) was originally discovered in Streptomyces peucetius in the 1970s. The mechanisms of action to damage DNA are mainly through DNA intercalation and generation of free radicals. Milatuzumab doxorubicin/IMMU-110 is the only ADC using doxorubicin as its payload tested in a phase I/II clinical trial, but was later discontinued [52].

Different ADCs employing DNA-damaging or anti-microtubule payload against the same antigen
Currently, 25 ADCs that use DNA-damaging agents as their payloads are either approved by the FDA (gemtuzumab ozogamicin/Mylotarg was withdrawn in 2010 but re-approved in 2017, inotuzumab ozogamicin was approved in 2017) or are being evaluated in clinical trials (Table 1). In this section, we summarize 10 ADCs using DNA-damaging payloads (2 out of 10 discontinued, 20%, Fig. 3) together with 13 other ADCs targeting the same antigens (5 out of 13 discontinued, 38%). It is not possible to conclude what the high discontinued rate of ADCs using anti-microtubule payload is because of the choice of the payload. However, we want to initiate this comparison, which requires additional time to follow the developmental process of the ADCs (Table 2). High competence is found in some ‘star’ targets such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and CD19.

HER2
HER2 is probably the most attractive target in the field of ADCs. Increased expression of HER2 is evident in 25–30% of breast cancers [53]. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer have an aggressive form of the disease with significantly shortened cancer-free survival and overall survival [54]. Increased levels of HER2 have a direct role in the pathogenesis of these cancers, thereby a therapeutic agent directly targeted against HER2 can provide valuable benefit to those patients. Trastuzumab emtansine, anti-HER2 ADC (T-DM1) is the only approved ADC to target HER2 that employs an anti-microtubule agent (DM1) as its payload [55]. However, T-DM1 is still not effective enough to kill cancer cells expressing relatively low levels of HER2. Therefore, only ∼20% of patients with breast cancer are eligible for HER2-targeted therapies, and a high relapse rate is observed in a majority of the patents with initial drug response, mainly because of intratumorally heterogeneous expression of HER2 [56]. Replacement of DM1 with a more potent duocarmycin payload (SYD985) is currently under clinical development to address the problem of the low eligibility proportion and high relapse rate of anti-HER2 ADC therapies [56, 57]. Different from T-DM1, SYD985 employs a cleavable linker that facilitates its bystander killing, especially against HER2-negative cancer cells [58]. DS-8201a is another promising anti-HER2 ADC equipped with DNA-damaging payload which has advanced to phase II clinical trial. Because SYD985 and DS-8201a show better efficacy than T-DM1 against breast cancer with low HER2 expression, there is optimism that they will be able to treat patients with low HER2 expression that cannot be treated by T-DM1 [47, 56, 57]. Regarding anti-HER2 ADCs with anti-microtubule payloads, two novel technologies are applied to generate XMT-1522 and MEDI4276, respectively. XMT-1522 is generated on the Dolaflexin ADC platform (polymer linker), which allows 12–15 auristatin payloads per antibody without harming the pharmacokinetics [59]. MEDI4276 is a biparatopic ADC targeting two different epitopes on HER2 that induces robust internalization and better efficacy than T-DM1 in vivo [62, 63].

CD33
CD33 is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily subset of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-related lectins. Two tyrosine residues are found in the cytoplasmic tail of CD33, which are phosphorylated upon pharmacological treatment (e.g. pervanadate) or receptor crosslinking. These phosphorylated tyrosine motifs are able to provide docking sites for recruitment and activation of Src homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases (SHP-1/2), which may result in transmission of inhibitory downstream signals, and affect the function of neighboring membrane receptors [60].
Approximately 85% of pediatric and adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases are ‘CD33+’, as defined by the presence of CD33 on greater than 20–25% of the leukemic blasts [61]. Two active anti-CD33 ADCs both use DNA-damaging agent as their payloads. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was used to treat AML from 2000 to 2010. However, it was voluntarily withdrawn by Pfizer concerning its low response rate (RR) and high liver toxicity. In recent years, four randomized clinical trials have been completed and strongly support the efficacy of Gemtuzumab ozogamicin in newly diagnosed AML. Finally, the FDA approved Gemtuzumab ozogamicin for treating newly diagnosed AML in 2017 [62]. A second anti-CD33 ADC currently under investigation is IMGN779, which uses an indolinobenzodiazepine payload. IMGN779 has accomplished its phase I trial, the patients showed much better tolerance to IMGN779 [maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is larger than 0.7 mg/kg] than to vadastuximab talirine (MTD = 0.02 mg/kg; however, phase III trial was discontinued in 2017) [63].

CD70
CD70 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily transiently expressed on nascent antigen-activated T and B lymphocytes. The receptor for CD70 is CD27; CD70–CD27 interactions regulate T- and B-lymphocyte functions. High levels of CD70 expression are found in lymphomas such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Upregulated CD70 can directly induce T-cell death and exhaustion or indirectly promote regulatory T-cell proliferation to promote tumor immunotolerance. The functional diversity of CD70 may be one of the major reasons that all anti-CD70 ADCs are discontinued.

CD19
CD19 is the earliest differentiation antigen of the B cell lineage and is ubiquitously expressed on all types of B lymphocytes except plasma cells. It assembles with the antigen receptor of B lymphocytes in order to decrease the threshold for antigen receptor-dependent stimulation [64]. CD19 is an attractive target for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Two anti-CD19 ADCs (SGN-CD19B and ADCT-402) using PBD dimer payload are currently in phase I clinical trials. ADCT-402 shows an encouraging complete RR of 34.3% so far, which is comparable to phase I data from denintuzumab mafodotin and coltuximab ravtansine (payloads = anti-microtubule agents) [65].

CD22
CD22 (Siglec-2) is expressed in a B-cell lineage-specific fashion, starting at the pre-B cell stage. CD22 is present on the surface of all stages of B cells, including activated B cells and memory B cells, but CD22 is lost after terminal differentiation into plasma cells. This broad expression profile during B-cell development has made CD22 an attractive target for leukemia. Inotuzumab ozogamicin was approved by the FDA in 2017. Similar to Mylotarg, it is composed of N-acetyl-calicheamicin γ1I conjugated to humanized IgG4 antibody [66]. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has significantly higher complete RR compared to standard chemotherapy (80.7% vs. 29.4%) [67]. Inotuzumab ozogamicin uses the same nonspecific conjugation chemistry as Mylotarg, which leads to a heterogeneous mixture of conjugate species. Different species potentially have differential stability, antigen-binding affinity and pharmacokinetics. The 2010 withdrawal of Mylotarg was believed largely due to the heterogeneous nature of the conjugate and the instability of the hydrazone linker, which leads to a narrow therapeutic window. However, it seems that the instability of hydrazone linker is antibody dependent. The same hydrazone linker is used in inotuzumab ozogamicin, in which good stability was found in human blood (∼2%/day hydrolysis was found).

Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5
Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) belongs to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored carcinoembryonic antigen family [68]. CEACAM5 is overexpressed on a variety of solid tumors and is associated with adhesion and invasion. The first-in-human anti-CEACAM5 ADC, SAR408701 (payload = DM4), has advanced to phase II trial. In the phase I/II trial of labetuzumab govitecan (payload = SN38), 41 out of 86 patients showed stabilized disease [50, 73].

TROP2
Trop2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein associated with different types of cancers. Its function involves cancer cell proliferation, survival, self-renewal and invasion. Sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132, payload = SN38) is the only ADC currently under active clinical investigation against TROP2. Promising results were released in December 2017 showing sacituzumab govitecan has an objective RR at 31% in patients with triple negative breast cancer.

Linkers for DNA-damaging ADCs
The first generation of FDA-approved ADCs employed an acid-cleavable hydrazone linker, which is stable in blood at neutral pH, but hydrolyzed once the ADC is internalized into the acidic endosomes and lysosomes (pH = 4–6). The acid-labile hydrazone linker was found to be crucial for activity. It makes use of the low pH of endosomal and lysosomal compartments. The release of the unconjugated intermediate at pH = 4.5 is 97% after 24 h at 37°C, whereas only 6% was found at pH = 7.4 [66].

In comparison to calicheamicin-based ADCs, duocarmcycin-, TOP inhibitors- and PBDs-based ADCs do not need a disulfide bond for their activity, which makes them feasible for cysteine conjugation. Conjugation to cysteine instead of lysine can significantly improve the homogeneity [69]. Under controlled reduction conditions, the interchain disulfide bond can be reduced and becomes available for excellent reactivity of maleimide-tagged payload. Regarding a typical IgG1, four interchain disulfide bonds can be reduced to eight conjugation-available SH sites. Further purification using hydrophobic interaction chromatography can be used to narrow down the species this method generates. The dipeptide linker [valine-citrulline (vc) or valine-alanine (va)], which can be cleaved by cathepsin B (lysosomal protease), is employed in the duocarmycin- and PBD-based ADCs. New site-specific conjugation methods that have been reviewed recently include engineered mAbs (THIOMAB, enzyme directed, unnatural amino acid) and native mAbs to site-specific conjugate 2–8 payload molecules (glycan modification, functional re-bridging of native disulfides and conjugation of cysteines obtained from reducing native disulfides) [9, 75, 76].

Chemical [70], near-infrared light [71] and tumor microenvironment-triggered payload release strategies have also shown promising results. There is probably no universal conjugate-linkage strategy optimal for all antibody-drug conjugates. It is necessary that each pair of antibody/drug be optimized to obtain the best therapeutic outcome. New linkers can be designed to improve water solubility (e.g. PEGylation) and tumor selectivity (e.g. enzymatic-cleavable, photocleavable, proton cleavable) [72]. This will substantially reduce the heterogeneity of ADCs and toxicity. Based on current development of the ADCs using DNA-damaging agents, we summarize that the ideal properties for a linker are as follows: (1) stable during circulation and (2) cleavable after binding to the target or internalization.

Perspectives
In recent years, appreciable advances have been made against liquid tumor using ADCs, bispecific mAbs and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy [73–78]. More work on optimization of ADCs is needed to cure patients from solid tumors [79]. We believe that payload is an important consideration when designing the next generation of ADCs, especially against solid tumors [80]. Emerging new payloads have shown promising pre-clinical/clinical data. Here are a few examples: new tubulysin payloads [display pM potency [81–83] or retain potency against multidrug-resistant cancer cells [84]], PM050489 [one β-tubulin binder originally isolated from marine sponge [85]], new cryptophycin [a microtubule binder at the vinca site [86]], new CPIs [DNA alkylator that can generate toxic interstrand crosslinks [87]], D211 (an isoquinolidinobenzodiazepine payload that belongs to the PBD dimer family), kinesin spindle protein inhibitors [88], FGX-2-62 (pyridinobenzodiazepines, sequence-selective DNA mono-alkylating agent), bicyclic octapeptide amanitins (an RNA polymerase II inhibitor) [89], spliceostatins and thailanstatins (RNA spliceosome inhibitors) [90–92] and PNU-159682 (an anthracycline which is three orders of magnitude more potent than doxorubicin) [93].

Higher potency payloads (e.g. DNA-damaging payloads) will make it possible to target a tumor-specific/ associated surface receptor at a relatively low expression level (less than 5000 receptors/cell). A more important criterion for the next generation of payloads is a higher therapeutic index than current payloads. To achieve this, it may require a shift from focusing on the mechanisms of action targeting the crucial survival pathways of cancer cells to other hallmarks of cancer: (1) reactivating growth suppressors, (2) inducing cell death, (3) blocking replicative immortality, (4) inhibiting angiogenesis and (5) hindering invasion and metastasis. The development of the next generation of ADC payloads also requires modern medicinal chemistry to achieve picomolar–femtomolar activity against targeted cells, which may require a combination of targeting two or several hallmarks of cancer.

Antibody engineering is another important consideration for the next generation of ADCs. In the 1990s, the ‘binding site barrier’ concept was introduced to illustrate that antibody binds to the target cell near the entry point after extravasation from blood capillaries, after which it further migrates to binding sites inside the tumor nodule [94]. High receptor density (∼105–106 receptors/cell) and high affinity antibodies (∼nanomolar) can slow down the movement from the perivascular space. Mechanism-based generic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PD) model is urgently needed to probe for potential solutions governing uniform penetration of an ADC in a solid tumor mass [95]. Therapeutic antibodies have been developed normally based on their binding to target cells. In order to improve ADC efficacy, new methods to screen for rapid internalizing antibodies by phage display technology have been explored [96]. To enhance solid tumor penetration ability, 3D-cancer cell culture can be readily utilized [96]. Bi-specific mAbs promote robust internalization [97] and allow a potential combination of ADC therapy and immunotherapy (e.g. CAR T-cell therapy). A biparatopic antibody shows improved internalization and is active to T-DM1 resistant cell lines [56]. Peptide-masked probody showed diminished antigen binding, but it can be activated by appropriate proteases from the tumor microenvironment [98]. This tumor-specific activation mechanism makes probody ADC with less systemic toxicity. Computational selection of cancer receptor targets for ADCs probably will play an important role in ADC design, although this method is still in an early stage of development.

Drug resistance limits the efficacy of cancer therapies. Tumor evolution or heterogeneity contributes to evasive mechanisms that limit durable responses [99]. Following recent approvals of ADCs, the following investigations on the resistance of ADCs potentially resulting in clinical treatment failure should be carried out in detail. Potential mechanism of resistance includes (1) escape by antigen-negative cancer cells or by limited surface antigen renewal, (2) hide by staying in resting (G0) phase of cell cycle, (3) increased permeability glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux, (4) overexpression of drug efflux transporters such as multidrug resistance protein. (5) alternation of bypass of cell-death pathways, (6) increased anti-apoptotic effects of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL activity, (7) high circulating antigen to compromise ADC binding to cancer cells and (8) defects in ADC trafficking pathways. Recent work on anti-CD276/B7-H3 ADCs demonstrated replaying Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) payload with PBD dimer successfully overcomes the Pgp-mediated drug resistance in tumor-infiltrating vasculature cells [100]. To further address the drug resistance problem, models of acquired resistance to ADCs are needed. Recent studies have used different approaches: (1) continuous exposure of ADC at low dosage, followed by incremental dose increase and (2) cyclical treatment for a short duration at moderate to high dose. High-potent DNA-damaging agents may have the potential to remove those cells in resting (G0) phase; however, this hypothesis still needs to be tested.

Using DNA-damaging agents as the payloads of ADCs has been well-established. Their safety/drug resistance clearly needs more investigation. Questions that need to be further addressed: (1) What are the mechanisms of ADC resistance?; (2) Can ADCs achieve targeting rare neoantigens in tumors?; (3) What are the suitable payloads for ADCs targeting immune cells? and (4) How do ADCs fit in combination treatments with immunotherapy?
