Erratum to: Biol Ther 4(1–2) (2014) DOI 10.1007/s13554-014-0017-1
The authors of the above-mentioned paper noticed some errors subsequent to publication and would like to make the following corrections.

On pages 5 and 6, Table 1 will include a footnote for the prior non-Omnitrope rhGH therapy: “These patients are not mutually exclusive, they could have been on multiple GH therapies prior to switching to Omnitrope”.

On page 10 under the heading Discussion the recommended dose of GH therapy in TS patients pre- and post-switch should be 0.33 mg/kg/week. The sentence should now read “We recognize that the GH therapy dose that was used in TS patients pre- and post-switch was less than the recommended dose of 0.33 mg/kg/week”.
