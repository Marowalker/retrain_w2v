==== Body
The authors of the above-mentioned paper noticed a few errors in the text, as reported. In the ‘Pharmacokinetics’ section, with regards to the C1 inhibitor, Cinryze® (ViroPharma Inc.), the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) (units/mL) values should read 0.68 ± 0.08 (n = 12) versus 0.85 ± 0.12 (n = 13), and not 0.68 ± 0.08 (n = 12) versus 0.33 ± 0.20 (n = 12), as reported. The authors regret this error, and thank Springer Healthcare for publishing the correction.
