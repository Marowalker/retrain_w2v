==== Body
Over recent years biotechnology has been instrumental in the development of key medicines such as monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, human insulin for the treatment of diabetes, and the cloning of erythropoietin to stimulate the production of red blood cells in the treatment of chronic anemia.

In this fast-paced area of medical research, we feel it is of utmost importance for specialist and generalist healthcare professionals alike to have access to the most up to date and relevant research, including analysis on how this research translates to treatment strategies in clinical practice. Each biological therapy has a highly sensitive and specific mode of action in relation to particular indications and therapy areas, and as such it was felt that research in these areas would be better suited to therapeutic area-specific journals, where data and information will gain optimal exposure and recognition in that particular field to the most relevant audience.

In accordance with this approach, Biologics in Therapy will be closing at the end of 2015. The Adis journal portfolio continues to welcome content relating to the discovery, development, and use of biological and biosimilar therapies in all medical fields, including high-quality preclinical, clinical (all phases), observational, real-world, and health outcomes research around the discovery, development, and use of such therapies. Studies relating to diagnosis, pharmacoeconomics, public health, quality of life, and patient care, management, and education are also encouraged throughout the portfolio.
