infection conditions. We have identified that Tat-activating regulatory
DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is involved in cytokine RNA processing in order
to promote an optimal immune response. The interaction of TDP-43 with
spliceosomal components from the Cajal body leads to the formation of a novel
sub-nuclear body called the Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 Splicing Activating
Compartment (InSAC). TDP-43 binds to the IL-6 and IL-10 RNAs in a
sequence-dependent manner. In cell-based studies, we observed that
lipopoly-saccharide (LPS) stimulation induces the formation of the InSAC through
TDP-43 ubiquitination, thereby influencing the processing and expression levels
of IL-6 RNA. Moreover, TDP-43 knockdown in vivo results in a
decrease in IL-6 production and its RNA splicing and stability. Thus, these
findings demonstrate that the InSAC is linked to the activation and modulation
of the immune response. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(5): 239-240]

TDP-43CytokineIL-6Nuclear bodyRNA processing
==== Body
The nucleus is compartmentalized into dynamic structural and functional sub-nuclear
bodies; the Cajal body (CB) is an example of such a characterized sub-nuclear body. The
CB is involved in the maturation of spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs) and the biogenesis of the telomerase ribonuclear protein complex, which
contributes to telomerase synthesis. Coilin is essential for CB integrity through its
interaction with several CB components, such as snRNPs, survival of motor neuron (SMN),
and Sm proteins. However, the precise molecular mechanism underlying the function of the
CB and other sub-nuclear bodies remains to be elucidated.

TDP-43 is a highly conserved heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP), that has
potential functions in RNA processing such as RNA transcription, splicing, trafficking,
and degradation. We demonstrate that endogenous TDP-43 is enriched within spherical
sub-nuclear bodies in macrophage and primary cell lines following LPS stimulation. Based
on the results from various cell lines, we have also shown that the formation of the
TDP-43 sub-nuclear body is related to the production of specific cytokines. Moreover,
the sizes of TDP-43-sub-nuclear foci are increased in a stimulation time-dependent
manner, and those structures are similar to CBs. However, the localization of TDP-43
foci does not overlap with that of CBs and other sub-nuclear bodies, such as the
nucleolus and promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. Therefore, the TDP-43-enriched
sub-nuclear body is novel structural compartment in the nucleus during the immune
response.

Cytokines are important for the regulation of the immune response, however the key
regulatory molecular complex related to cytokine RNA processing is largely unknown.
Since the formation of TDP-43 foci is linked to cytokine production, we examined the
molecular function of TDP-43 in cytokine RNA processing. TDP-43 depletion reduces the
expression levels of IL-6 and the quantity of its mRNA in response to LPS. In addition,
accumulation of unspliced IL-6 pre-mRNA and impairment of IL-6 RNA processing are
observed in TDP-43 depleted cells, indicating that TDP-43 is important for IL-6 RNA
processing and stability. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), as well as RNA secondary
structure prediction programs, reveal that TDP-43 binds to mouse IL-6 pre-mRNA intron 2
containing a predicted stem-loop structure consisting of GC-rich palindromic repeats and
a short spacer. However, TDP-43 knockdown does not affect the processing of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α RNA, which does not contain structure-specific sequences.
Furthermore, both an RNA splicing assay based on the IL-6 minigene, and an RNA-FISH
assay using Cy3-labeled IL-6 or IL-10 RNA, supported the notion that the TDP-43
sub-nuclear body is the essential nuclear site for IL-6 or IL-10 mRNA production and
stability. As a result of this observation, it was named InSAC (the IL-6 and IL-10
Splicing Activating Compartment).

The TDP-43-mediated recruitment of essential spliceosomal components from CBs provides
the molecular mechanism underlying InSAC formation in response to LPS. LPS stimulation
induces post-translational modifications of TDP-43, such as oligomerization,
fragmentation, and ubiquitination. In particular, we focused on the ubiquitination of
TDP-43 and investigated the effect of UBE2E3, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme for
TDP-43, on InSAC formation and IL-6 RNA processing. UBE2E3 depletion reduces TDP-43
ubiquitination and IL-6 expression levels. The decreased InSAC number and impaired IL-6
RNA processing are also observed in UBE2E3-depleted cells. Therefore, TDP-43
ubiquitination is required for InSAC formation in order to regulate IL-6 RNA processing.
Using in vivo delivery reagents for TDP-43 siRNA, we observed reduced
IL-6 mRNA production and defective RNA processing in the spleens of TDP-43-depleted
mice, without any alteration in the amount of TNF-α RNA. In addition, in
vivo, TDP-43-depleted mice show a decrease in IL-6 expression levels in
serum, strongly supporting the role of TDP-43 as a critical regulator of IL-6 RNA
processing.

In conclusion, this study identifies and characterizes the InSAC as a novel sub-nuclear
site for IL-6 and IL-10 RNA processing. Our study demonstrates that IL-6 and IL-10 RNA
processing is tightly controlled by TDP-43-mediated InSAC formation. TDP-43 serves as a
scaffold protein in the InSAC and competitively recruits critical spliceosomal
components from CBs in order to facilitate specific cytokine RNA processing (Fig. 1). In particular, TDP-43 interacts with RNAs
containing GC-rich palindromic repeats along with the conserved ‘ACU’
sequence motifs within a short spacer region. These findings provide substantial new
insight into the molecular mechanism of cytokine RNA processing. Additionally, IL-6
levels are usually elevated in the serum of patients suffering from hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and obesity. Interestingly, it has been reported that IL-6-/-
mice develop fewer tumors than wild type controls, and that TDP-43-depleted xenograft
mice reduce HCC volume and weight (Naugler et al (2007) Science 317:
121-124, DOI.10.1126/science.1140485, Park et al (2013) Hepatology 58:
182-191, DOI: 10.1002/hep.26310), indicating that TDP-43 overexpression may lead to
accelerated IL-6 RNA production by recruiting a large amount of spliceosomal components
that could lead to liver inflammation. Additionally, inflammatory diseases could be
characterized by excessive TDP-43-induced InSAC formation. Taken together, these data
provide further insight into the molecular pathology of various cancers, autoimmune
diseases, and obesity, thereby contributes to the development of improved therapies for
treating these diseases.
