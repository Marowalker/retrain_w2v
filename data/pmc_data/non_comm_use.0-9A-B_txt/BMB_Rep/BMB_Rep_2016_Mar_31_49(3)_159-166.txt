ligand-receptor signal transduction have been identified. In the extrinsic
pathway, apoptotic signal transduction is induced in death domain (DD)
superfamily; it consists of a hexahelical bundle that contains 80 amino acids.
The DD superfamily includes about 100 members that belong to four subfamilies:
death domain (DD), caspase recruitment domain (CARD), pyrin domain (PYD), and
death effector domain (DED). This superfamily contains key building blocks: with
these blocks, multimeric complexes are formed through homotypic interactions.
Furthermore, each DD-binding event occurs exclusively. The DD superfamily
regulates the balance between death and survival of cells. In this study, the
structures, functions, and unique features of DD superfamily members are
compared with their complexes. By elucidating structural insights of DD
superfamily members, we investigate the interaction mechanisms of DD domains;
these domains are involved in TNF ligand-receptor signaling. These DD
superfamily members play a pivotal role in the development of more specific
treatments of cancer. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(3): 159-166]

INTRODUCTION
Apoptotic cell death is a critical decision point in the life cycle of mammalian
cells. It is triggered by intrinsic, mitochondria-mediated or extrinsic
receptor-mediated signaling pathways (1).
This process occurs via a well-defined sequence of morphological
events (2). The intracellular mechanism that
is responsible for apoptosis appears to be similar in almost all mammalian cells.
These mechanisms depend on the members of a protease superfamily, which has cysteine
at their enzyme’s activity site. The substrates cleave at specific aspartic acids.
Hence, they are termed caspases (3). During
this process, the dying cell undergoes condensation of nucleus and cytoplasm.
Furthermore, blebs develop in the plasma membrane. The cell breaks up into
membrane-enclosed fragments that are known as apoptotic bodies; these apoptotic
bodies contain intact organelles. The apoptotic bodies are rapidly engulfed by
neighboring cells or professional phagocytes, such as dendritic cells and
macrophages. This prevents the release of potentially toxic chemicals in tissues
(1-2, 4).

Biological responses may vary from cell survival to cell death. These responses are
mediated by many protein complexes that contain homotypic interaction motifs, such
as death ligand/receptor complex, apoptosome protein complex, and DISC (5, 6). The typical model of signal transduction pathways entails transmembrane
receptors. These receptors become active after docking a ligand. Then, they transmit
signals in the cytoplasm to generate new signal transduction complexes (5, 6). Owing to the interaction between tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (TNFR-1), there is rapid
clustering and internalization of death domain (DD) complex. This process proceeds
through the formation of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles (7). After the internalization of TNFR-1 in human endothelial
cells, DD complex induces NF-κB regulation factor. However, TNFR-1 is able to
promote apoptotic cell death. The DD superfamily induces cell survival and apoptotic
cell death via TNFR-1 dependent signal cascade. This superfamily is
a vital regulator for maintaining the homeostasis of cells in humans (Fig. 1) (5-9).

Fig. 1. Cell signaling pathway through which DD complex elicits a balance between
survival and programmed cell death (9).
In the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, the interaction between DD superfamily members
plays an important role in the formation of DISC. With this pathway, procaspase-8 is
activated (10). The DISC is assembled in the
cytoplasm. Furthermore, TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), TNF-related
weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), TNF-α, TNF-β, and Fas ligand (FasL) are
the death ligands that interact with death receptors and TNF receptors. They
constitute apoptotic signaling platforms of extrinsic pathway (5, 10, 11).

Apoptotic signal transduction is induced through a homology domain containing a
hexahelical bundle of 80 amino acids. With this process, DD superfamily members are
produced (12-14). Furthermore, DDs construct key building blocks that are
involved in the formation of multimeric complexes; these complexes are associated
with death signaling cascades. In this study, we summarize recent findings that
elucidate three dimensional structures of TNF ligand-receptor superfamily. They
provide molecular and functional characterization of homotypic DD interaction
motifs, which are associated with programmed cell death.

THE DEATH-FOLD INTERACTIONS
When the signal of Fas receptor is activated, the Fas-associated death domain protein
(FADD) develops homotypic interaction motifs, such as DD and death effector domain
(DED). With these motifs, caspase-8 can be recruited to the docking site. In this
process, Fas and caspase-8 interact simultaneously via DD and DED
(9). The aspartate-specific cysteine
proteases (Caspases) are primary executioners of non-inflammatory cell death.
Effector caspases cleave regulatory enzymes, such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP). They also cleave activating endonucleases, such as caspase-activated
deoxyribonuclease (CAD) (15). Biologically,
caspases are broadly categorized into initiator and effector caspases. The initiator
caspases have death-fold motifs, such as DED or caspase recruitment domain (CARD).
They trigger non-inflammatory cell death by activating effector caspases. The
activation of effectors is conducted by initiator caspases, which act at cytoplasmic
sites, nucleus, and other organelles. Many death-fold interactions are formed by
specific adaptor molecules, such as CARDs, DEDs, DDs, and pyrin domains (PYDs): they
belong to the superfamily of DD (16).

An apoptotic protease cascade develops when cytochrome c influences dATP-dependent
interaction of apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf-1) and caspase-9.
Consequently, the apoptosome is generated via a CARD-CARD homotypic
interaction (Fig. 2A-C) (17). When cytochrome c and Apaf-1 are bound to each other,
the signaling complex is activated. Consequently, there is autoactivation and
recruitment of procaspase 9 (18). The active
apoptosome complex contains several Apaf-1, procaspase-9 proteins, and general
complex forms; the molecular weight of these components is approximately 700 kDa
(19).

THE DD SUPERFAMILY
Many proteins have significantly different amino acid sequences. However, functional
and structural characteristics indicate that a common ancestor is probably involved
in superfamilies (20). The DD superfamily,
which is characterized by the presence of conserved homotypic interaction motifs,
has emerged as the principal mediator in the transduction of a cell signal (21). About 100 members of DD, DED, CARD, and
PYD subfamilies have been identified till date (12-14). Despite the appreciable
divergence in the overall sequence of each member, the structure of each DD is
hallmarked. The DD superfamily constitutes six amphipathic α-helices that are
folded in an antiparallel α-helical bundle. The atomic structures of DD
superfamily are determined by either nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or X-ray
crystallography (Fig. 2E-H) (22-26).

Recently, many studies have been conducted on DD superfamily proteins. In these
studies, it is proved that DD superfamily proteins contain many different motifs;
the features of these different motifs have significant differences. The differences
exist even within the members of subfamilies. These differences are caused by the
alterations in the size and arrangement of α-helices. Furthermore, these
differences are also caused by the varying distribution of charged and hydrophobic
residues along the surface (23-26). As a result, all the superfamily members
are included in the homotypic interaction proteins of every kind. Furthermore, they
do not cross the boundaries of subgroup (27). Compared to respective structural features, it is likely that DDs have
an exposed third α-helix. This α-helix is more pliable than other
subfamilies (Fig. 2E-H) (22-26). The CARD is
another DD subfamily consisting of members with a highly conserved structure. There
is striking similarity between members of CARD and the amino-terminal domains of
DD-containing proteins: CRADD and Apaf-1 (24, 28). The most significant
difference between CARD and other subfamilies is as follows: the first α-helix
(α1) leads to the disruption of hydrogen bonds between nitrogen atoms of amide
and oxygen atoms in the carbonyl group of CARD. The helix in CARD is composed of two
short helices in α-helix: the first part is α1a and the second part is
α1b. Both the parts are connected by a linker region. Owing to bending,
residues present at the C-terminal of helix α1 in Apaf-1 are closer to the
hydrophobic core; they are far away from the corresponding residues in RAIDD CARD
(24, 28). This helical shift is propagated in the remaining portion of the
molecule. Consequently, the positions and boundaries of all other helices and
surface loops are altered (24, 28-30). The PYD subfamily members have a hydrophobically stabilized loop region
between helices α2 and α3. The connecting loop of PYD is longer than that
of other subfamilies, whereas the exposed helix α3 in PYD is shortest in the DD
superfamily (25, 31). The DED subfamily has exposed hydrophobic sites, which
are smaller than DDs in the helix region. Moreover, a conserved motif is present
between helices α5 and α6 (26,
32, 33). This specific motif contains amino acids, such as aspartic acid and
arginine, in helix α6. They mediate protein folding and ensure the functional
conformation of DEDs. Negatively charged amino acids (glutamic acid, aspartic acid,
or asparagine) are conserved at the N-terminal. Furthermore, there is an
Arg-x-Asp-Leu (RxDL; ‘x’ for any amino acid) motif in nearly all DEDs (33). Most single and tandem DED proteins have
RxDL motifs that are consistent in the highly conserved region; however, this motif
is not present in other DD subfamilies (Fig.
2D) (26, 33, 34). When the
three-dimensional structure of MC159 (v-FLIP) was elucidated, a hydrogen-bonded
triad was revealed on the surface of DED1 and DED2. This triad contributes to the
highly charged features on one face of the structure (32). Previous studies prove that RxDL motif mediates
molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV) protein MC159 and block apoptosis (33, 35). Convertsely, the charged amino acids in caspase-8 and caspase-10
are either greatly altered or missing in DEDs. The DED2 domain in caspase-8 has
three charged amino acids: Glu, Lys, and Ser (36). By converting arginine to lysine, the hydrogen bonding potential
decreases and there is interaction with only one negatively charged amino acid. In
caspase-10, RxDL motif is missing in both DED1 and DED2. Therefore, we deduce that
this motif does not play an important role in the recruitment of caspase. However,
it is important in other functions of proteins containing DED (32).

THE DEATH INDUCIBLE SIGNALING COMPLEX
NMR spectroscopy is used to develop three-dimensional models of FADD, DED, and DD
(32, 37). Members of DD superfamily include Fas and FADD; they share helix
α6 strands with Greek key topology (32,
27). It has been shown that this
topology governs the process of protein folding. This process is initiated by the
formation of a hydrophobic pocket, which contains almost all the conserved sites of
DD superfamily (38). The DD domains regulate
the assembly of death inducing, multimeric signaling complexes exhibiting the
activity of critical effectors (9). However,
very limited information is available about the structural features of DDs complexes
till date. By performing X-ray crystallography, models of cell death have been
identified; these models induced Fas/FADD-DISC (39). The complex activates procaspase-8, which forms an integral part
of programmed cell death pathway. It is triggered by binding between Fas-receptor
and FasL or between TNFR-1 and TNF-α (40, 41). FasL is expressed in
activated T lymphocytes or natural killer (NK) cells. They cause the destruction of
target cells, such as virus-infected or damaged cells (42). The Fas/FADD-DISC crystal structure exists in the closed
form owing to lack of a stimulus. This is followed by multimerization of its
factors; they form an active platform (39).
In FasL-treated cells, Fas and FADD proteins form signaling complexes
via modular interaction in their C-terminal DDs (39, 42). Furthermore, FADD recruits caspase-8 through DED, promoting their
enzymatic activity and stimulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins
(38, 39, 43).

In Fas receptor signaling, the central event involves the formation of DISC; it is
comprised of procaspase-8, procaspase-10, cellular FLICE-like inhibitory proteins
(c-FLIP), and adapter molecule FADD (44).
The procaspase-mediated apoptosis is crucial to Fas/FADD-DISC signaling study. All
procaspase-8 isoforms have two N-terminal DEDs that are similar to the isoforms of
c-FLIP protein. In this study, we identified several DED isoforms of procaspase and
c-FLIP at DISC. There were two procaspase-8 isoforms: (procaspase-8a [p55] and
procaspase-8b [p53]). In addition, there were three c-FLIP isoforms, such as c-FLIP
long (c-FLIPL), c-FLIP short (c-FLIPs), and c-FLIP Raji
(c-FLIPR) (Fig. 3) (26, 44-47). Recently, Schleich
et al. demonstrated that FADD, procaspase, and c-FLIP were the
DED members forming a signaling complex in their DED domains (48). The new paradigm of DISC proved that procaspase-8/10 is
activated via the assembly of DED chains assembly (48, 49). These chains enable the homodimerization of procaspase-8, which
plays an important role in the activation of procaspase-8 in DISC. For example,
owing to the mutations of some key binding amino acids in procaspase-8, DED2
interrupts the formation of DED chain in cells. Moreover, these specific binding
sites are conserved in nearly all DED domains; these domains interact with another
DED via hydrophobic interaction motif of phenylalanine/leucine (FL
motif) (Figs. 2D and H) (22-26, 49, 50). After the formation of DED chain, procaspase-8a/b homodimer
processing involves two sequential cleavage steps at the DISC. The first cleavage
step takes place at the aspartic acid 374, which lies between p18 and p10 caspase
subunits. The second cleavage step occurs in two aspartic acids: Asp216 and Asp384.
Consequently, large protease subunit p18, small protease subunit p10, and the
prodomain p26/p24 are produced. Owing to DED chain processing, the active caspase-8
heterotetramer, p182-p102, is subsequently released into
cytosol and it triggers an apoptotic signal cascade (51, 52). The
procaspase-8-dependent apoptotic death is interrupted by c-FLIP; however, it is also
activated when DED interacts at DISC. The shorter c-FLIP isoforms
(c-FLIPs and c-FLIPR) consist of only tandem DEDs that
block cell death and procaspase-8 cleavage. However, the long splice variant of
c-FLIP isoform (c-FLIPL) either accelerates or blocks cell death and
procaspase-8 cleavage; the interaction of c-FLIP isoform depends on its density
(53, 54). The DED chain model helps us in elucidating the molecular
mechanisms of DD superfamily.

SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION OF LIGANDS AND RECEPTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TNF
SUPERFAMILY
Two different forms of TNF-α and lymphotoxin-α were identified in activated
macrophages and T cells (55, 56). Several members of TNF superfamily and
their receptors are identified in many tissues and organs of animals (57). Each factor of TNF superfamily interacts
with at least one receptor of TNFR superfamily. Furthermore, some TNF factors bind
with several receptors (5, 8, 21). TNF-α is a cytokine that exhibits inflammatory activity; a member
of a group of cytokines is included in the TNF-ligand superfamily. The TNF-ligand
superfamily plays an important role in regulating cellular life and death (57, 58).

TNF-α plays an important role in the regulation of immune cells; however, it can
also induce apoptotic cell death and inhibit tumorigenesis, metastasis, bone
resorption, and viral replication (59-61). In addition, TNF-α plays an
important role in the activation of two distinct cell surface receptors: TNFR-1 and
TNFR-2 (6, 59, 60). The expression of
TNFR-2 is manifested in the immune system and endothelial cells, whereas the
expression of TNFR-1 is detected in many tissues. In TNFR-1, the extracellular
position has four characteristic cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) for the purpose of
interaction; these CRDs bind directly with the TNF-α trimer (6, 57-59). Previous studies prove
that owing to the interaction between TNF-α and TNFR-1, activation of proteins
is mediated in the following components: tumor necrosis factor receptor type
1-associated death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
kinase 1 (RIPK1), and TNF-R-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). These events play a crucial
role in the cascade of TNF signal transduction pathway (59-61).

DD SUPERFAMILY-MEDIATED CELL SIGNAL CASCADE
In most cell lines, nearly all death receptors mediate apoptosis; moreover, TNFR has
several signal transduction pathways, controlling a broad spectrum of life and death
in cells (Fig. 1) (9, 57, 58). With an activated TNFR-1 signal cascade,
the lysine 63 polyubiquitination of RIPK1 is promoted (62, 63). Protein
kinase RIPK1 functions as a kinase depending on the extent to which it undergoes
ubiquitination. It either regulates prosurvival transcription factor NF-κB or
promotes apoptotic and necrotic cell death under the effect of TRADD, FADD,
caspase-8, and RIPK3 (62-65). The assembly of RIPK1, TNFR-1, and TRADD
complex (complex I) was found to be inhibited by cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
protein 1 (cIAP1) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (cIAP2) in cytosol
(62, 66, 67). Furthermore, with the
interaction of these two inhibitor proteins, the polyubiquitin chains of RIPK1 were
formed. They act as a crucial binding site in TAK1/TAB2/3 complex and
NEMO/IKKα/β complex. NF-κB is translocated in the nucleus by these
two complexes. Thereafter, there is expression of cylindromatosis (CYLD), tumor
necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), and other NF-κB related
factors (64, 66, 68).

Recent studies prove the intracellular signaling kinase RIPK1 acts as a key switch in
the regulation of cell fate. Depending on the cellular context, RIPK1 determines
whether the pieotropic cytokine TNF induces activation, apoptosis, or programmed
necrosis of NF-κB (69, 70). RIPK1 is involved in the regulation of
cell death when there is internalization of death receptor. RIPK1 is dissociated
from TNFR-1 of TNF signal transduction complex, while lysine 63 deubiquitination of
RIPK1 is mediated by the following deubiquitination enzymes: CYLD and A20. These
enzymes inhibit the expression of prosurvival transcription factor, NF-κB (5, 62, 63). Following deubiquitination,
RIPK1 interacts with TRADD, FADD, RIPK3, generating TRADD-dependent complex (complex
IIA) and RIPK1-dependent complex (complex IIB) (63, 70-72). Complex IIA necessitates a TRADD-FADD scaffold to recruit
caspase-8, which has DED and DD sites. Thus, an apoptotic pathway is initiated (5, 21, 71).

When TRADD does not exist, RIPK1 is formed and apoptosis signal pathway is initiated.
With the formation of complex IIB, there is FADD-mediated recruitment and activation
of caspase-8 at the cleavage of RIPK1 and RIPK3. Owing to the interaction between
these two RIPK superfamily proteins, there is increase in metabolic activities. In
this process, the activities of glutamate dehydrogenase 1, glutamate ammonia ligase,
and glycogen phosphorylase may an important regulatory role. This results in
programmed necrotic cell death (63, 65, 69-71).

When X-ray crystallographic and NMR studies were performed on the members of DD
superfamily, a great deal of information was obtained. These studies prove that its
members play a pivotal role in the assembly and regulation of complexes, which are
crucial for cell survival and programmed cell death signaling. They ensure the
recruitment of kinase proteins through an interaction with homotypic motifs. Despite
conservation in topology, members of DD superfamily have three dimensional
structures with significant difference. Among DD superfamily proteins, the major
structural difference is the presence of diverse twisting angles between each
α-helix bundle. These angles are formed by several helices in DD, and they
exhibit the biggest difference in three dimensional structure. Owing to the
structural differences in DD superfamily, none of the superfamily members undergo
cross interactions among subgroups. Owing to the interaction between TNF-ligand and
TNF-receptor superfamily, there is mediation in many DD proteins. These proteins
create new signal transduction complexes, such as apoptosome, DISC, and other
multimers of DD. The apoptosis that is induced by TNF receptor is a biologically
relevant form of cell death; it occurs in the presence of sufficient DISC activity.
In the extrinsic pathway, Fas/FADD oligomerization regulates apoptotic signal
cascade. Depending on the homotypic interaction with DD superfamily, the transition
occurs between programmed cell death and survival (71). Previous studies prove that the expression of DD superfamily
increases in cancer cells and tissues, which are treated with anticancer agents.
This indicates that DD superfamily participates in the action of these agents (73, 74). Moreover, many extrinsic signaling pathways stimulate tumor cells
to induce programmed cell death; these events are independent of tumor-suppressor
p53 (75). Thus, DD receptors might be a
useful target in cancer research studies. In this study, we summarized the
structural characterization and function of homotypic interaction motifs and their
complexes. The findings of this study play an important role in the development of
more specific treatments that are used for curing inflammation and cancer.
