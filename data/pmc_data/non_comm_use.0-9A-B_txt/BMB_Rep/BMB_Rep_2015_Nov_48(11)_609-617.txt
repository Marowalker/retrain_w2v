ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of quinone substrates.
The NQO1- mediated two-electron reduction of quinones can be either
chemoprotection/detoxification or a chemotherapeutic response, depending on the
target quinones. When toxic quinones are reduced by NQO1, they are conjugated
with glutathione or glucuronic acid and excreted from the cells. Based on this
protective effect of NQO1, the use of dietary compounds to induce the expression
of NQO1 has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer prevention. On the other
hand, NQO1-mediated two-electron reduction converts certain quinone compounds
(such as mitomycin C, E09, RH1 and β-lapachone) to cytotoxic agents,
leading to cell death. It has been known that NQO1 is expressed at high levels
in numerous human cancers, including breast, colon, cervix, lung, and pancreas,
as compared with normal tissues. This implies that tumors can be preferentially
damaged relative to normal tissue by cytotoxic quinone drugs. Importantly, NQO1
has been shown to stabilize many proteins, including p53 and p33ING1b, by
inhibiting their proteasomal degradation. This review will summarize the
biological roles of NQO1 in cancer, with emphasis on recent findings and the
potential of NQO1 as a therapeutic target for the cancer therapy. [BMB Reports

==== Body
INTRODUCTION
NQO1 (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1) is a cytosolic flavoenzyme, which is also
known as DT-diaphorase (EC 1.6.99.2) (1).
NQO1 is expressed in various tissues, and its gene expression is regulated by the
ARE (antioxidant response element), both in normal condition and during oxidative
stress conditions (2). The NQO1 gene
contains ARE in its promoter region and is regulated by the nuclear factor
(erythroid-dereved)-like 2 (Nrf2) (3). The
NQO1 gene has been shown to be activated together with other Nrf2-induced
detoxifying enzyme genes, such as GST (glutathione S-transferase) and HO-1 (heme
oxygenase), in response to antioxidants, ionizing radiation, xenobiotics, heat
shock, electrophiles, hypoxia, and heavy metals (1, 4).

The catalytic enzyme properties of NQO1 were first reported by Ernster and Navazio in
1958 (5). NQO1 is considered as an
anticancer enzyme since it protects cells from oxidative stresses through inhibition
of quinones from entering the one electron reduction to semiquinone free radicals
and ROS (reactive oxygen species) (6, 7). Thus, the use of dietary compounds to
induce the expression of NQO1 has emerged as a promising strategy for cancer
prevention (8, 9). Recent studies have revealed that NQO1 activity is related
to the risks of lung cancer (6, 7, 10,
11) or cancer of other organs (12, 13). Development of several types of human cancers has been shown to be
due to NQO1 polymorphisms (14-18). Recent meta-analysis studies have shown
that, in the human representative catalytic mutated NOQ1 gene (C609T) located on
chromosome region 16q22, replacement of cytosine with thymidine (609C > T)
express substitution of serine for proline, thereby reducing the NQO1 enzyme
activity, leading to development of several types of human cancers (11, 16-21).

Although a lowered or absent NQO1 activity has been correlated with increased
susceptibility for development of human cancers (11, 21), numerous studies found
that NQO1 is upregulated in a number of cancers such as breast cancer, pancreatic
cancer, colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, uterine cervical cancer, melanoma,
and lung cancer (22, 23). In breast, colorectal and cervical cancers, the
high-level expression of NQO1 was found to be associated with the late clinical
stage of the disease, poor differentiation and lymph node metastasis (22, 23). Consistently, breast and cervical cancer patients with high NQO1
expression levels show lower DFS (Disease-free Survival) and 5-year OS (Overall
Survival) rates, as compared to patients having lower NQO1 expression (22, 23). In addition, NQO1 activity in many cancers is significantly higher
than that in adjacent normal tissues (1,
24-26).

With its unique property of transferring two-electron by using either NADH or NADPH
as reducing cofactor, NQO1 catalyzes the natural and exogenous quinones and
quinineimines into hydroquinones, which are toxic (27-29). Accordingly, there has
been considerable effort to develop bioreductive anticancer drugs, such as mitomycin
C, E09, RH1, β-lapachone, and 17AAG, which are activated specifically by NQO1
and, thus are preferentially toxic to cancer cells (30-38). Importantly, it has
been reported that ionizing radiation (2-4Gy) (1, 38-40), cisplatin (1), or
hyperthermia (41-42℃) (41, 42) increased the NQO1 expression levels in
various human and animal cancer cells, and sensitized the cells to β-lapachone,
both in vitro and in vivo.

Recent emerging studies have revealed the protective roles for NQO1 regardless of its
enzymatic activities (43). NQO1 structurally
binds to the important tumor suppressor p53 and increases its protein stability by
inhibiting proteasomal degradation (43).
Furthermore, NQO1 appears to regulate the protein stability of other proteins such
as p33, p73, p33ING1b, and C/EBPα (44-48).

These studies suggested that NQO1 is a multifunctional antioxidant enzyme and an
exceptionally versatile cytoprotector, which contributes to a dual function in
tumorigenic progression. This review will describe the biological significances of
NQO1 in cancer, with emphasis on recent findings, and the potential of NQO1 as a
therapeutic target for cancer therapy.

BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF NQO1 AND CANCER PREVENTION
One way to prevent cancer development is suppression of the carcinogenic metabolic
activation and preventing the production of ultimate carcinogens (49). Recent studies showed that induction of
phase II enzymes, such as GST, HO-1, and NQO1, correlates with inhibition against
chemical-mediated tumorigenesis in animal models, during the promotion as well as
initiation stages (8, 49). Among phase II enzymes, NQO1 has been most extensively
studied for its effect in preventing carcinogenesis (8, 50). The multiple and
general biochemical roles of NQO1 in the protection against the promotion and
initiation of cancer, can be summarized into the following four categories (Fig. 1): (i) detoxification of quinone
substrates by two-electron reduction; (ii) scavenging of SOD (superoxide anion
radicals); (iii) maintenance of the endogenous antioxidants such as ubiquinone and
α-tocopherol; and (iv) stabilization of the suppressors p53/p73/p33
proteins.

Fig. 1. The biochemical multiple and general roles of NQO1 in protection against
the development of cancer.
Detoxification of quinones by NQO1
In various species including rat, zebrafish, mouse, and human, NQO1 is well known
as a homodimeric flavoprotein (2, 51, 52). The best-described and widely accepted function of NQO1 is, as
its name suggests, the reduction of quinones (2). Endogenous and environmental quinones are highly reactive
molecules that can induce cancers and neurodegenerative diseases (53). NQO1 catalyzes the obligatory
single-step twoelectron reduction of the quinones to hydroquinones. Then the
hydroquinones can undergo conjugation reactions (e.g., glucuronidation).
Consequently, they are readily excreted from the body (2, 50). The
two-electron reduction activity catalyzed by NQO1 is of benefit to the cell as
it prevents generation of free radicals by redox cycle (54). Thus, the detoxification of redox-cycling quinones
by NQO1 protects the cells from oxidative stresses and prevents carcinogenesis
(55, 49). For example, NQO1-mediated reduction of menadione
produces its formation of stable hydroquinone to be readily conjugated and
excreted from the body (53). This
NQO1-mediated two-electron reduction of quinones inhibits the production of
unwanted one-electron reduction of them by other enzymes such as cytochrome P450
(50, 56, 57). The
oxidoreductase functions have been proposed to involve a hydride transfect
between the NADH and FAD cofactors and from FADH2 to the quinone substrate (50, 53). NQO1 can reduce a very broad range of substrates, including
quinones, dichlorophenolindolphenol, quinone-imines, methylene blue,
glutathionyl-substituted naphthoquinones, and also azo and nitro compounds (53, 56). In addition to the two-electron reduction, NQO1 is also capable
of performing four-electron reduction of nitro compounds and azo dyes (58). The ability of NQO1 to reduce the
toxicity and carcinogenicity of various quinones has been reviewed
comprehensively elsewhere (59, 60).

NQO1 as a scavenger of superoxide anion radicals
Recent studies demonstrated that NQO1 directly scavenges superoxides in an
NAD(P)H-dependent manner (27, 50). This protective effect may be
significant for certain tissues, such as vasculature and myocardium, in which
NQO1 is highly expressed (27, 61, 62). In cardiovascular tissues, the high NQO1 enzyme activity
compensates for the lows of cardiovascular superoxide dismutase expression in
the detoxification reaction of superoxide anion radicals, which are produced by
various sources, including xanthine oxidase, NAD(P)H oxidases, mitochondria, and
uncoupled NOSs (nitric oxide synthases) in cardiovascular tissues (61).

NQO1 as an antioxidant enzyme
There has been known that NQO1 maintains certain endogenous antioxidants in their
reduced and active forms (50). Oxidation
of α-tocopherolquinone, which is produced by vitamin E (α-tocopherol),
has antioxidant properties following reduction to α-tocopherolhydroquinone
(53). NQO1 catalyzes the
two-electron reduction of α-tocopherolquinone to its hydroquinone form,
which then protects against lipid peroxidation of the membranes (61). Furthermore, NQO1 catalyzes the
reduction of ubiquinone analogs (coenzyme Q) to their ubiquinol forms in
liposomes (53). However, the in
vivo role of the above two-electron reduction reactions remains to
be elucidated.

NQO1 as a protein stabilizer
The tumor suppressor p53, which is one of critical transcription factors related
to suppression of tumourigenesis, induces either growth arrest or apoptosis, in
response to stresses such as DNA damage (43). The p53 protein is regulated via modification and interactions
that affect its half-life (44). Under
normal conditions, p53 protein is rapidly degraded due to its interaction with
Mdm-2 that induces ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (44). Pro-apoptotic stresses disrupt this
interaction between the p53 and Mdm-2 proteins, allowing the p53 to accumulate
(63). NQO1 has been shown to
stabilize the tumor suppressor p53 protein (43). When NQO1 expression is upregulated in cancer cells under
conditions of stress, NQO1 stabilizes p53 by inhibiting its proteasomal
degradation. This effect was reversed by the potent NQO1 inhibitor dicoumarol,
as well as other inhibitors that compete with NAD(P)H (43). This effect of dicoumarol suggests that it affects a
structural change in NQO1, which inhibits interaction between the NQO1 and p53
proteins (45, 46). Although the precise mechanism by which NQO1 activity
stabilizes p53 is poorly understood, the NQO1-mediated stabilization of p53
represents a unique additional mechanism by which NQO1 may protect against
carcinogenesis. In addition, it has been reported that the degradation of tumor
suppressor proteins p73 and p33 is regulated by ubiquitination. Recently, it has
been shown that NQO1 can also inhibit p73 and p33 degradation in the presence of
NAD(P)H, and protects them from 20S proteasomal degradation (44, 63). Furthermore, NQO1 appears to regulate the degradative fate of
other proteins, such as p33ING1b and C/EBPα (47, 48). These
finding suggest that NQO1 plays an important role as a gatekeeper, in regulating
the proteasomal degradation of specific proteins.

REGULATION OF NQO1 GENE AND CANCER PREVENTION
The use of dietary compounds or synthetic chemicals to decrease the incidence of
cancer has been established half a century ago (8). Numerous studies demonstrated that chemopreventive agents are Nrf2
inducers (8). Thus, the use of
chemopreventive agents to induce the Nrf2/KEAP1/ARE signaling pathway, leading to
the elevation of the expression of NQO1 gene, has emerged as a promising strategy
for cancer prevention (8, 9). As the name of the pathway suggests, three
major components are important to the transcription of the NQO1 gene: (i) ARE, DNA
consensus sequences that are located in the promoter regions of the genes (53, 64); (ii) Nrf2, one of leucine zipper transcription factor, binds to the
ARE, thereby signaling transcription of target genes (43); (iii) Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) binds
Nrf2 and promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation by Cul3-based
ligase (8, 9).

Regulation of NQO1 gene expression
Analysis of the human, mouse and rat genes for NQO1 showed that NQO1 is located
at 16q22.1 on the human chromosome, and mouse chromosome 8 (52, 53, 65, 66). The NQO1 gene consists of five introns and six exons for an
approximate length of 20 kb (53). There
is considerable homology between the human and rat NQO1 coding sequences (85%)
(65). The first two amino acids and
the first nucleotide of the third amino acid are encoded by Exon 1, while the
remaining 272 amino acids are encoded by exons 2-6 (53). NQO1 is regulated by two distinct regulatory
elements in the 5’ flanking region of the NQO1 gene that are the ARE, called the
EpRE (electrophile response element), and the XRE (xenobiotic response element),
called the AhRE, both under basal and during oxidative stress conditions (2, 53). A variety of antioxidants, H2O2, and
tumor promoters increase AREmediated NQO1 expression (53, 64). Many
transcription factors can recognize ARE, TMAnnRTGAYnnnGCRwww, in
vitro, indicating that this is a composite regulatory DNA sequences
(53). Because the AP-1 binding
sequences, TGASTMAG, are similar to the ARE sequences, GTGACnnnGC, AP-1 and
leucine zipper proteins (bZIP) including Nrf1, Nrf2 and Maf, participate in the
induction of NQO1 gene (53, 67). A model of ARE-mediated regulation of
hNQO1 is proposed by Wasserman and Fah1 (68). The ARE core sequence (RTGAYnnn) interacts with the bZIP
transcription factors (Jun, Fos, Fra, Nrf, Maf, Raf and NF-E2) (53). It has been known that the
Nrf2-KEAP1/ARE signaling pathway is the major regulator of cytoprotective
responses to oxidative and electrophilic stresses (69). XRE-mediated gene expression involves the liganded
aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The XRE-mediated gene expression is
increased by PAS (Per, Arnt, Sim) family of proteins (68). The AHR/Arnt dimer interacts with the DNA sequences,
XRE (70). TCDD and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons induce NQO1 gene expression (71). However, one study 8 reported that, in mouse hepatoma cells,
TCDD-induced human NQO1 was ARE- mediated and not dependent on XRE (72).

Chemoprevention by upregulating NQO1
Environmental carcinogens, including quinones, are first metabolically activated
via the phase I enzymes such as cytochrome P450 into reactive intermediates
(8). At the cellular level, there
exist competing phase II enzymes (e.g. NQO1) which eliminate the reactive forms
of carcinogens through biotransformation reactions, including quinone reduction,
acetylation, sulfation and glutathione conjugation (8). Therefore, the use of dietary compounds or synthetic
chemicals to shift the balance between phase I and II enzymes, is a promising
strategy for cancer chemoprevention (73-75). The concept of
chemoprevention strategy is closely correlated with Nrf2/KEAP1/ARE signaling
pathway-induced expression of NQO1 (8).
Many studies reported that potent Nrf2 inducers can be obtained from plants
including cruciferous vegetables (sulforaphane), a wide used spice (curcumin),
green tea (epigallocatechin-3-glaate), grapes (resveratrol), conifer trees
(caffeic acid phenethyl ester) and Japanese horseradish (wasabi) (8). This chemopreventive natural
compounds inducing Nrf2/NQO1 signaling pathway are continuously growing, and
these have been reviewed comprehensively elsewhere (9). The signaling pathway is summarized in Fig. 2.

Nrf2/KEAP1/ARE signaling pathway and regulation of NQO1 gene.
NQO1 gene polymorphisms
It has been known that NQO1 polymorphisms increase the susceptibility for
developing cancer (6, 7, 10-18). Two types of
polymorphisms of the NQO1 gene have been reported in humans (43). The prominent one is a single
nucleotide mutation, which is replacement of cytosine with thymidine (609C ＞ T),
of the NQO1 gene (13, 43). This mutation produces a proline to
serine substitutions at position 187 of the amino acid sequence of the NQO1
(6, 7, 10-18). Another mutation NQO1*2 protein is rapidly degraded
by the proteasome (76). In addition, it
has been reported that the null phenotype or deficiency for NQO1 increases the
susceptibility to the neoplastic and toxic effects by benzene (43, 77). A large number of studies reported that the NQO1 polymorphisms
correlate with the susceptibility for developing several types of cancer.
However, the results showed inconsistency because of the small sample size in
the majority of studies (16). In order
to overcome the problem of low statistics, a few number of meta-analyses were
performed in individual studies. However, these meta-analyses considered
individual cancer sites separately (16).
Therefore, a global meta-analysis to investigate the role of NQO1 polymorphisms
should be conducted.

THE POTENTIAL OF NQO1 FOR CANCER THERAPY
Although absent or lowered NQO1 activity has been associated with the susceptibility
for developing several types of human cancers as presented above (6, 7,
10-18), the clinical significance of expression levels of NQO1 in human
cancers has not been fully elucidated. In humans, NQO1 is overexpressed in a variety
of solid tumors, including those of the adrenal gland, breast, colon, bladder,
liver, ovary, cervix, pancreas lung, and thyroid (6, 22, 23, 78-80). In cancers, this feature has been
exploited to activate anticancer drugs that are bioreductively activated by NQO1. In
addition, there has been growing interest in the development of strategies to induce
NQO1 activity in cancer cells for increasing the efficacy of bioreductive anticancer
drugs.

Bioreductive quinone substrates for NQO1
Bioreductive anticancer drugs such as mitomycin C (MMC), β-lapachone and
benzoquinone ansamycins, are activated by NQO1. MMC is a quinone containing
antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces caespitosus. For more than 30 years, MMC
has been used for the treatment of solid human tumors including breast, lung,
pancreas and stomach (81). The mechanism
of action of MMC is intracellular bioreductive activation which lead to DNA
interstrand crosslinking (81). Since MMC
is bioactivated by NQO1, the level of NQO1 is a good predictor of MMC
sensitivity. In specifically hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments, other
bioreductive enzyme can effectively activate MMC (82). Therefore, NQO1 expression level and NQO1
polymorphsim may not be important to determine the clinical response to MMC
therapy (81). Another representative
quinone, β-lapachone, is a naturally occurring ortho napthoquinone isolated
from the bark of the lapachon tree (Tabeduia avellanedae) (1, 38, 83, 84). NQO1-induced activation of β-lapachone showed
anti-trypanosomal, anti-fungal and anti- bacterial properties by production of
hydrogen peroxide and superoxide with the simultaneous oxidation of reduced
pyridine nucleotides (85). Early studies
reported that β-lapachone could inhibit topoisomerase I, thereby inhibiting
the repair of DNA in mammalian cells (81). β-lapachone (ARQ 501) is processed in the Phase I and II
clinical trials for the cancer therapy (81). Finally, the benzoquinone ansamycins including geldanamycin
(GA) and 17-AAG are a group of quinone. GA, which is isolated from Streptomyces
hygroscopicus, has anticancer properties by inhibiting RNA and DNA replication
(86). It has also been reported that
GA could inhibit the activity of vSrc and inhibit the expression of the cMyc
(81). In addition, GA targets the
heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) by inhibiting its ATPase activity (81). GA effectively inhibits
Hsp90-mediated maturation of many oncogenic proteins such as HER2, Raf-1, KIT,
BCR-ABL as well as steroid hormone receptors (81). Therefore, GA and its analogs such as 17-AAG and 17-DMAG have
shown anticancer effect in various human cancers. NQO1 can convert 17-AAG to the
hydroquinone of 17-AAG. The hydroquinone of 17-AAG, IPI504 (Retaspimycin), was
developed as a more water-soluble alternative to 17-AAG. The IPI504 actively
inhibits Hsp90 and shows markedly more potency than the parent quinone (87). In recent years, several new
NQO1-dependent anticancer compounds have been developed, such as
2,5-diaziridinyl-3-3[hydroxymethyl]-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (RHI);
3-hydroxy-5-aziridinyl-1-methyl-2 [indol-4,7- dione ]-prop-b-en-a- ol (EO9); and
3,4-dihydro-2, 2-dimethyl-2H-naphthol[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione (β-lapachone)
(83).

Upregulation of NQO1 in cancer therapy with bioreductive anticancer
drugs
Cytotoxic quinone anticancer drugs may have the advantage of preferentially
damaging the cancer cells when the cancer cells when the NQO1 enzyme is
upregulated or overexpressed, relative to their action on cancer cells in normal
conditions (1, 38, 83, 84). Recently, it has been shown that
ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses (e.g., 2 Gy) significantly
upregulates the NQO1 level in cancer cells, and sensitizes the cells to
β-lapachone (38, 39). When cells expressing NQO1 are
treated with a combination of ionizing radiation and β-lapachone, positive
feedback regulation between ROS and ERK leads to ER stress, inducing
mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax and JNK activation. Subsequently, the
decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential leads to translocation of AIF and
apoptosis (84). We have also recently
reported that hyperthermia (e.g. 41-42℃) increases the enzymatic activity
of NQO1 and Hsp70-mediated stabilization of NQO1, and sensitizes the cells to
β-lapachone in vitro
(41, 52, 83). Heat shock elevates
NQO1 expression by cis-acting elements such as ARE and XRE. The degradation of
NQO1 protein in heat-treated cancer cells was slower than in untreated cells.
After heating, the Hsp70 co-localized and co-precipitated with NQO1 in cancer
cells, indicating the association of these two proteins in cancer cells (83). In addition, experimental mouse
tumors or human tumor xenografts could be markedly sensitized to
β-lapachone treatment by heating the tumors 24 h prior to β-lapachone
treatment (41, 42). Furthermore, cisplatin significantly upregulates NQO1
in cancer cells, thereby markedly increasing the sensitivity of the cancer cells
to β-lapachone in vitro as well as in
vivo. These data suggested that local treatment of
tumors with established cancer therapies such as hyperthermia or radiotherapy,
which is summarized in Fig. 3, may
upregulate NQO1 in the tumors and selectively sensitize the cancer cells to
β-lapachone. Phase I and II clinical trials are conducted in progress to
determine the feasibility of using β-lapachone alone or in combination with
other anticancer drugs against human solid tumors (88). In order to improve the delivery and clinical
efficacy of β-lapachone to tumors are being investigated (89-91).

NQO1-dependent β-lapachone-induced cancer cell death.
CONCLUSION
There has been accumulating evidence exhibiting the versatile cytoprotective role of
NQO1, in particular for cancer prevention and protection from oxidative
stress-related diseases. A large number of studies reported the role of NQO1
polymorphisms in susceptibility for generation of several types of cancer.
Importantly, certain compounds become cytotoxic due to reduction mediated by NQO1.
Interestingly, NQO1 is overexpressed in providing an opportunity to preferentially
damage cancers relative to normal tissues, using bioreductive anticancer drugs.
Furthermore, there has been growing interest in the development of strategies to
induce NQO1 activity in cancer cells for increasing efficacy of bioreductive
anticancer drugs.
