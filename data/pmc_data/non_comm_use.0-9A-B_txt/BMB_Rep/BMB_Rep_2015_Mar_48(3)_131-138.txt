seems to be an adaptation to increased hemodynamic demands. The characteristics
of cardiac hypertrophy include the functional reactivation of the arrested fetal
gene program, where histone deacetylases (HDACs) are closely linked in the
development of the process. To date, mammalian HDACs are divided into four
classes: I, II, III, and IV. By structural similarities, class II HDACs are then
subdivided into IIa and IIb. Among class I and II HDACs, HDAC2, 4, 5, and 9 have
been reported to be involved in hypertrophic responses; HDAC4, 5, and 9 are
negative regulators, whereas HDAC2 is a pro-hypertrophic mediator. The molecular
function and regulation of class IIa HDACs depend largely on the
phosphorylation-mediated cytosolic redistribution, whereas those of HDAC2 take
place primarily in the nucleus. In response to stresses, posttranslational
modification (PTM) processes, dynamic modifications after the translation of
proteins, are involved in the regulation of the activities of those
hypertrophy-related HDACs. In this article, we briefly review 1) the activation
of HDAC2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and 2) the PTM of HDAC2 and
its implications in the regulation of HDAC2 activity. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(3):

INTRODUCTION
Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptation process to meet the increased hemodynamic
demands in peripheral tissues due to underlying diseases, such as hypertension,
valve stenosis or regurgitation, or even myocardial infarction (1-3). The
characteristics are an increase in cellular burden of individual cardiomyocytes and
rebirth of the fetal gene program without an apparent expansion of cardiomyocyte
populations. Although the initial hypertrophy is physiological, sustained stimuli
without alleviation of the underlying causal disease leads the heart to a
pathological state (2). If the underlying
disease continues without correction, the function of the hypertrophied heart
declines, leading to heart failure. Despite intensive management, heart failure is
still one of the most common causes of death (4).

To acquire proper functions, many proteins undergo modification after translation by
enzymes, a process referred to as posttranslational modification (PTM). Indeed,
diverse PTMs are involved in the regulation of the amount, function, and
localization of many proteins. For example, phosphorylation is a critical
modification for enzymatic activation (5),
binding to DNA (6), forming complexes (7), and subcellular localization (8). Polyubiquitination, a continued link of
ubiquitin to the lysine residue of a target protein or ubiquitin itself, affects
protein stability, whereas monoubiqutination regulates other functions (9). These kinds of modifications are finely
regulated by paired enzymes with opposite functions, such as kinases and
phosphatases, methyltransferases and demethylases, acetyl transferases and
deacetylases, and ubiquitinylases and deubiquitinylases.

Protein acetylation is also closely related to enzyme activity (10), DNA recruitment (11), and transcription (12). It
typically occurs on lysine residues; however, N-terminal acetylation has also been
reported (13). This process replaces a
hydrogen atom with acetyl moiety. Among acetylation-associated regulation, the
biological implications of acetylation of histones H3 and K4 have been established;
histone tail acetylation induces loosening of DNA from histones, leading to
increased accessibility for the transcriptional machinery. Histone deacetylation, on
the other hand, results in transcription silencing (14, 15). Histone acetylation is
finely regulated by the balance between histone acetyl transferase and histone
deacetylase (HDAC) activities.

HDAC AND DIVERSE DISEASES
Eighteen HDACs have been discovered in mammals and divided into four classes.
HDAC1/2/3/8 are class I HDACs. HDAC4/5/6/7/9/10 are members of the class II HDACs.
Class III HDACs (HDAC12-18) are classified as a sirtuin group and they require
NAD+ for intrinsic activity. HDAC11 is the only class IV HDAC. Class
II HDACs are further subcategorized into two subclasses: HDAC4/5/7/9 for class IIa
HDACs and HDAC6/10 for class IIb. Molecular structures, tissue distributions, and
subcellular localizations are summarized in Fig.
1.

export signal, Black: histone deacetylase domain.
Although class II HDACs have a conserved HDAC domain, it is somewhat controversy
whether they actually have deacetylase activity in vivo
(16, 17). Indeed, the role of class IIa HDACs is regarded as serving as a
scaffold to form a larger complex for transcription repression. Additionally, class
II HDACs interfere with binding of transcription activators, such as MEF2 (8, 18). Some reports, including ours, however, showed that the class IIa
HDACs possess minute but significant intrinsic deacetylase activity in
vivo
(19, 20).

The subcellular localization of class IIa HDACs is controlled by exogenous signals
(8, 21, 22): activated PKC/PKD or
CaMKII phosphorylates serine residues that flank the nuclear localization signal
domain. Shuttling molecules, such as 14-3-3 or CRM1, bind specifically to
phosphorylated class IIa HDACs, which results in the masking of the nuclear
localization signal. This enables class IIa HDACs to exit to the cytoplasm. In
contrast, information on the regulation of class IIb HDACs is limited; both HDAC6
and HDAC10 are primarily localized in the cytoplasm. HDAC6 specifically regulates
acetylation of α-tubulin and thereby microtubule assembly (23); however, the functional implications of HDAC6 remain to
be clarified.

Although the molecular sizes of class I HDACs are relatively small, their enzyme
activities are greater than those of class IIa HDACs. Class I HDACs are exclusively
involved in protein deacetylation. Indeed, class I HDACs contribute most of total
HDAC activity measured in vitro in whole cell lysates. HDAC1 and
HDAC2 are major deacetylase enzymes of histones for transcriptional repression.
Interestingly, HDAC1 redundantly regulates histone acetylation together with HDAC2
(14, 24).

The clinical implications of the roles of HDACs have been suggested based on the
effects of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) in various diseases. For example, vascular
calcification (25) may be aggravated by HDAC
inhibition. This suggests that loss of HDAC activity may play a key role in the
development of the disease. On the other hand, a non-selective HDACi effectively
arrests the cell cycle or induces apoptosis (26). For example, trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-HDACi, blocks smooth
muscle cell proliferation, suggests that HDACi may have therapeutic potential for
atherosclerosis and restenosis after stent insertion in coronary arteries (27). Numerous research groups have tested the
anti-neoplastic properties of HDACi and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
approved suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and romidepsin for novel regimens against
cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Sodium valproate, which has long been used as an
anti-epileptic therapeutic, has undergone a phase II clinical trial for treating
solid tumors (28).

In addition to anti-neoplastic activity, recent pioneering work has revealed that
HDACi are also beneficial for diverse cardiac diseases: arrhythmia (29), myocardial infarction (30-32), hypertension (33), and
cardiac hypertrophy (34-38). In the following section, we discuss 1)
the role of HDACs and 2) the regulation mechanisms of HDACs in cardiac
hypertrophy.

HDACs AND CARDIAC HYPERTROPHY
Class I HDACs are expressed ubiquitously, whereas class II HDACs are not. Among the
class II HDACs, HDAC4/5/6/7/9 are expressed in the heart; however, the specific role
of each subtypes is not yet known. The first understanding of class II HDACs’
roles in the cardiac fields was in relation to HDAC9 (8). Based on the phenotype evaluation of whole-body deletion
of HDAC9, it was suggested that HDAC9 may function as a negative regulator of
cardiac hypertrophy; cardiac hypertrophy is dramatically exaggerated in HDAC9
knockout (KO) mice.

MITR, an endogenous alternatively spliced form of HDAC9 that lacks the HDAC domain,
successfully rescued the absence of HDAC9 in vivo. These
observations suggest that the function of HDAC9 in vivo may be as a
‘simple’ transcriptional repressor in a deacetylase enzyme-independent manner.
Although the HDAC5 KO phenotype is similar to that of HDAC9 (21, 22), in contrast
to HDAC9, interestingly, HDAC5 has the function of an “enzyme” during
the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Recently, we reported that HDAC5
deacetylates HDAC2, a pro-hypertrophic mediator, and thereby suppresses its activity
(19).

Among the class I HDACs, both HDAC1 and HDAC2 redundantly regulate cardiac
development in the embryo (24).
Cardiac-specific KO of HDAC1 or HDAC2 did not affect cardiac morphogenesis, whereas
double deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 was lethal at postnatal 14 day due to severe
dilated cardiomyopathy. HDAC2, however, is the major class I HDAC in the adult
heart. At least in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, the enzyme activity of
HDAC2 is solely increased in response to hypertrophic stimuli without alteration of
its expression level (39). The subcellular
localization of HDAC2 was not changed in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.
Rather, PTM-dependent activation is a key regulatory mechanism (19, 35, 39).

THE ROLE OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE 2 IN CARDIAC DISEASE
HDAC2’s role in cardiac disease first emerged as a responsible factor for
“homeodomain-only protein” (HOPX)-derived hypertrophy (37). Kook et al. reported
that cardiac-specific overexpression of atypical HOPX that lacked a DNA binding
motif could induce cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy induced by transgenic
overexpression of HOPX was blocked completely by HDACi. Interestingly, HOPX requires
HDAC2 to induce cardiac hypertrophy; transgenic mice that overexpress HOPX that do
not interact with HDAC2 fail to induce cardiac hypertrophy. This study first
reported that class I HDAC might also be involved in cardiac hypertrophy and that it
counteracted the function of class IIa HDACs. To delineate the net effect of the
simultaneous inhibition of both class I and class II HDACs, non-selective HDACi were
used. We (36) and others (38, 40) observed that cardiac hypertrophy provoked by pressure overload or
by hypertrophic agonists was inhibited successfully by pan-HDACi. In subsequent
studies, our group further showed that class I-selective HDACi also successfully
inhibited cardiac hypertrophy, as pan-HDACi did (36, 40), suggesting that class
I HDACs are responsible for the anti-hypertrophic action of pan-HDACi. Next, we
tried to find which subtype of class I HDAC was responsible for the development of
cardiac hypertrophy and found that diverse hypertrophic stresses specifically
activated HDAC2. Thus, we concluded that HDAC2 played a central role in cardiac
hypertrophy. HDAC2 activation contributes to a common pathway that various
hypertrophic stresses merge into and inhibition of HDAC2 may be a therapeutic target
to reverse cardiac hypertrophy and concomitant heart failure.

A HDAC2 KO study reinforced the conclusion above. Trivedi et al.
(41) reported that whole-body KO of
HDAC2 resulted in partial lethality due to failure of myocardial maturation and a
trabeculation defect in the perinatal period. Surviving HDAC2 KO mice recover growth
and cardiac function at 2 months of age. In the adult, genetic disruption of HDAC2
resulted in resistance against hypertrophic stimuli induced by pressure overload, a
β-adrenergic agonist, or crossing with HOPX transgenic mice. Gain-of-function
of HDAC2, however, induced cardiac hypertrophy significantly, whereas transgenic
overexpression of HDAC1 or HDAC3 failed to do so.

The heart provides oxygen and nutrients to the periphery by its rhythmic contraction,
which is strictly controlled by an electrical conducting system. Some evidence has
been reported that HDAC2 participates in the electrical physiology of the heart.
Montgomery et al. performed gene ontology analyses from
cardiac-specific disruption of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 and found dramatic upregulation
of calcium channels: Cacna1h and Cacna2d2 (24). We also performed cDNA microarray studies to check the mRNAs
altered by transgenic overexpression of HDAC2 in the heart and found that several
channel subtypes for ion handling were dysregulated: Scn3b, Kcne1, Cacnb2, and
Scn2a1 (unpublished data). Considering that dysfunction of Kcne1 is involved in
hereditary familial arrhythmia, by causing long QT syndrome, and that loss of
function of Scn3b leads to Burgada syndrome (42), alteration of HDAC2 activity may indeed participate in cardiac
arrhythmia.

HDACi effectively controls atrial arrhythmia. Ismat et al. (43) performed surface ECG in HOPX-null mice
and observed P-wave widening, QRS-complex widening, and prolongation of the QT
interval. Connexin40 was also decreased aberrantly in those mice. On the other hand,
P-wave duration was prolonged and atrial refractory periods were shortened in
HOPXtransgenic mice (29). TSA successfully
reversed the conduction defect by normalization of connexin40. On the basis of a
physical interaction between HOPX and HDAC2 in vivo, we assume that
the anti-arrhythmogenic properties of TSA may be associated with inhibition of HDAC2
recruited by HOPX (37, 44).

POSTTRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATION OF HISTONE DEACETYLASE 2 IN CARDIAC
HYPERTROPHY
Next, we sought to understand the regulatory mechanism of HDAC2 in cardiac
hypertrophy. First, we found that diverse hypertrophic stresses specifically
activated HDAC2 (39). By hypertrophic
stimuli, heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was induced markedly to maintain HDAC2
activity. The requirement for HDAC2 activation in cardiac hypertrophy was further
confirmed by use of an enzymatically inert mutant of HDAC2: HDAC2 H141A that loses
HDAC activity due to destruction of the active pocket without altering interactions
with other proteins. When HDAC2 H141A was overexpressed, no apparent cardiomyocyte
hypertrophy was observed. Based on these observations, we concluded that increased
HDAC2 activity was critical for hypertrophy.

Regarding the HDAC2 regulatory mechanism, however, no change in protein amount or
mRNA expression was observed, raising the possibility of the involvement of PTM.
Indeed, HDAC2 phosphorylation was increased significantly by hypertrophic stimuli.
Using bioinformatics and by scrutinizing previous reports, four serine residues were
picked as phosphorylation candidates: S394, S411, S424, and S424. By an in
vitro kinase assay using synthetic peptides, we found that S394 and
S411 phosphorylation were increased significantly in tissue lysates obtained from
hypertrophied mouse heart. Interestingly, S422 and S424 were also basally
phosphorylated in heart lysate from normal mice; however, we did not observe any
further increase in phosphorylation of those residues with hypertrophy. Next, we
observed that the intrinsic activity of HDAC2 was decreased significantly when S394,
S422, or S424 was mutated, whereas the enzyme activity of HDAC2 was unchanged in the
S411A mutant. According to these results, we concluded that basal activity of HDAC2
is maintained by S422 and S424 phosphorylation, whereas hypertrophy-associated
phosphorylation and subsequent enzyme activation of HDAC2 were mediated by S394
phosphorylation. Indeed, in primary culture cardiomyocytes and in transgenic mice,
overexpression of HDAC2 wild-type successfully induced hypertrophy, whereas HDAC2
S394A failed to do so. HDAC2 S394 phosphorylation and hypertrophic phenotypes were
blocked by various casein kinase (CK) 2 inhibitors and by CK2α1 siRNA.
Transgenic overexpression of CK2α1 in the heart successfully induced
hypertrophy, which was further exacerbated by crossing TgCK2α1 with TgHDAC2
wild-type, but blunted by mating with TgHDAC2 S394A in vivo. Thus,
CK2α1-dependent phosphorylation of HDAC2 S394 is the key modification for both
HDAC2 activation and cardiac hypertrophy (35).

We also found that HDAC2 itself could be regulated by acetylation dynamics. Various
hypertrophic stresses acetylate HDAC2 at lysine 75 and acetylation activates HDAC2.
HDAC2 K75R, an acetylation-resistant mutant that loses intrinsic activity, failed to
induce hypertrophy. In contrast, the acetylationmimicking mutant of HDAC2, HDAC2
K75Q, showed an increase in enzyme activity and also possessed pro-hypertrophic
properties.

We further examined whether an interplay between acetylation and phosphorylation
existed in the regulation of HDAC2 activity; HDAC2 S394 phosphorylation was
decreased significantly in HDAC2 K75R. On the other hand, HDAC2 K75 acetylation was
unchanged in HDAC2 S394A. The intrinsic activity of HDAC2 K75R was not further
downregulated by S394A. These results suggested that 1) HDAC2 K75 acetylation
precedes and is mandatory for HDAC2 S394 phosphorylation and 2) the acetylation did
not directly activate the intrinsic activity of HDAC2, but indirectly induced
activation of HDAC2, by S394 phosphorylation.

We further tried to find the enzymes involved in HDAC2 acetylation. We observed that
HDAC2 acetylation was finely balanced by pCAF and HDAC5, a class IIa HDAC. Both
HDAC2 acetylation and phosphorylation were upregulated significantly in HDAC5 null
mice. Phosphorylated HDAC5 underwent cytoplasmic redistribution after recognition by
CRM1. Leptomycin B, a CRM1 inhibitor, interfered with the shuttling of HDAC5 to the
cytoplasm and thereby showed anti-hypertrophic features by tethering HDAC5 in the
nucleus. Adenoviral expression of HDAC2 K75Q, a constitutively acetylated form of
HDAC2, overcame the anti-hypertrophic activity of leptomycin B. Agonist-induced
cardiac hypertrophy in HDAC5 KO mice was alleviated by HDAC2 K75R delivery to the
heart, delivered via the tail vein (19). To
summarize, hypertrophic stresses activate both CK2α1 and PKD. PKD
phosphorylates class IIa HDACs and phospho-class IIa HDACs shuttle out to the
cytoplasm. HDAC2 undergoes acetylation by pCAF and then phosphorylation by
activated-CK2α1. Alternatively, hypertrophic stresses also induce the
expression of HSP70. HSP70 recognizes and binds to phospho-HDAC2, which results in
protection of HDAC2 phosphorylation against phosphatases (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Working hypothesis. In the basal condition, HDAC2 interacts with HDAC5
and protein phosphatase. Both HDAC5 and protein phosphatase keep HDAC2
inactivated. Loss of intrinsic activity of HDAC2 leads to de-repression of
anti-hypertrophic gene activation, such as INPP5F or KLF4. The cardiac fetal
gene program remains arrested by the inhibition of INPP5F or KLF4 (left).
When the myocardium is stimulated by hypertrophic stresses, several
signaling cascades operate. Class IIa HDACs, including HDAC5, are
phosphorylated by PKD and undergo cytoplasmic redistribution after binding
with 14-3-3. At the same time, CK2α1 is also activated, by
phosphorylation, and is shuttled into the nucleus. Inducible heat shock
protein, HSP70, is induced in the nucleus. pCAF binds to and deacetylates
HDAC2, which allows CK2α1 to phosphorylate HDAC2 at serine 394. HSP70
specifically binds to phosphorylated HDAC2. Functionally activated HDAC2
suppresses the expression of negative regulators of hypertrophy, which
induces reactivation of the fetal gene program. Red stars indicate
phosphorylation. Abbreviations. Ac: acetylation, CK2α1: casein kinase

DEACETYLATION TARGET OF ACTIVATED HDAC2 IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CARDIAC
HYPERTROPHY
So, which signal cascade relays activation of HDAC2 to hypertrophic phenotypes in the
cardiomyocytes? Trivedi et al. (41) performed DNA microarray assays to assess dysregulated genes in
HDAC2 KO mice and they found inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase F (INPP5F), a
negative regulator of the PI3K system. Genetic disruption of HDAC2 in the heart
resulted in an increase in expression of the gene encoding INPP5F, which then
resulted in inactivation of AKT and then reactivation of GSK3Β. Next, Zhu et
al. (45) generated wholebody
deletions of INPP5F in the mouse and found that isoproterenol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy was exaggerated significantly. Thus, INPP5F works as a negative
regulator of cardiac hypertrophy by serving as a target of activated HDAC2. However,
genetic ablation of INPP5F in vivo did not spontaneously cause
hypertrophy, suggesting that INPP5F is not a unique target of activated HDAC2.
Indeed, we found Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was an alternate target of activated
HDAC2. To find HDAC2- resposive elements and the transcription factor responsible,
we performed promoter mapping analyses with the natriuretic peptide
precursor A (encoding atrial natriuretic factor, ANF) promoter. The
anti-hypertrophic action of HDACi was abolished when the region from -130 to -105
was deleted. Among the putative binding factors on this HDACi-responsive element,
the expression level of KLF4 was altered both by HDACi and agonist stimuli. The
expression of KLF4 and thereby binding on the Nppa-promoter were
decreased significantly in the activation of HDAC2 induced by hypertrophic agonists
or by HDAC2 transfection. Forced expression of KLF4 in the cardiomyocyte blunted
hypertrophy. Thus, we concluded that HDAC2 activation regulated the transcription
level of KLF4, a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy (46) (Fig. 2). Other
groups have also reported the anti-hypertrophic function of KLF4 in
vivo. Liao et al. (47) observed that cardiac hypertrophy was exacerbated in mice with
cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of KLF4.

It has been reported that numerous proteins undergo acetylation and their unique
functions are finely regulated by acetylation dynamics (10-12, 48). It has not been fully understood which
enzymes are associated with the deacetylation process; however, several HDACs target
non-histone proteins (23, 49-53). Indeed, HDAC2 also has non-histone substrates, such as the
glucocorticoid receptor, BCL6, STAT3, and YY1. In addition to
transcription-dependent regulation targets, such as INPP5F (41, 45) and KLF4
(46), as above, it is possible that
activated HDAC2 relays signal to non-histone target(s) in the development of cardiac
hypertrophy. Considering that the cardiac-specific transcription factor GATA4 is
involved in HOPX-HDAC2 signals in cardiac morphogenesis (44), acetylated GATA4 might be one of the novel targets for
HDAC2 in cardiac hypertrophy.

DISCUSSION
We have clarified the role of HDAC2 and its regulatory mechanism in cardiac
hypertrophy (Fig. 2). When the myocardium is
stimulated by various exogenous stresses, numerous signal cascades are activated.
For example, PKC/PKD is activated and phosphorylates class IIa HDACs. HSP70 is
induced dramatically in the cytoplasm and pCAF is also activated in a PTM-dependent
manner in the nucleus. Phosphorylated class IIa HDACs are captured by shuttling
molecules and redistributed into the cytoplasm, whereas HSP70 shuttles into the
nucleus. pCAF acetylates HDAC2 K75, which then allows CK2α1 to phosphorylate
HDAC2 S394. Activated HDAC2 is then recruited on promoters that drive the expression
of anti-hypertrophic mediators, such as INPP5F or KLF4, which, in turn,
downregulates the expression of those mediators by deacetylation of histones
associated with their promoters. Downregulation of anti-hypertrophic regulators
results in reactivation of an arrested fetal gene program, thereby resulting in
cardiac hypertrophy.

Cardiac hypertrophy is a double-edged sword. Hypertrophy, a form of cardiac
remodeling, however, is also an essential adaptation for increased hemodynamic
demands, at least at the beginning of a cardiac compensation period. The transition
mechanism from physiological to pathological hypertrophy remains unclear. We
observed the enzyme activity of HDAC2 peaked prior to the apparent hypertrophy and
returned to basal levels in the heart failure phase (39). Considering that increased HDAC2 activity is a key step in cardiac
hypertrophy, the abrupt loss of HDAC2 activity might be a cue signal to transit to
heart failure. A study using HDAC2 activators would be necessary to assess this.

We found a novel crosstalk between class I and class II HDACs in
vivo. Fischle et al. (16) also reported the formation of a functional complex including class
I and class II HDACs. The class II HDAC recruits and uses the class I HDAC to
deacetylate promoters. In that model, however, the class II HDAC does not serve as
an enzyme but as a scaffold. Moreover, it is also believed that diverse signaling
cascades converge into the two classes HDACs and both classes of HDACs regulate
cardiac hypertrophy independently. We observed, however, that HDAC5 does have
intrinsic activity and the enzyme activity of HDAC5 is indispensable for the
deacetylation of HDAC2 and that the HDACs-mediated signal cascade, considered as two
independent axes, can merge into a single stream.

FUTURE ASPECTS
Other types of PTM of HDAC2 beyond phosphorylation and acetylation have also been
reported in various disease models (54-57). Colussi et al. (55) reported that HDAC2 was significantly
upregulated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy and blockade by HDACi or
cysteine-S-nitrosylation was beneficial to improve dystrophy symptoms. Nott
et al. (54) observed in
neuronal development that S-nitrosylation of HDAC2 induced its dissociation from
DNA, which then resulted in histone acetylation and then transcription activation.
Thus, it is plausible that the S-nitrosylation modification of HDAC2 is a potent
modification to suppress its activity. Recently, HDAC2 sumoylation has also been
reported (57), which causes enzymatic
activation.

We assume that dephosphorylation may participate in the inactivation of HDAC2 (19, 35, 39). Though a hypertrophy-
associated phosphatase of HDAC2 has not been identified, in other disease
conditions, some phosphatases have been suggested as HDAC2 phosphatases (58-60). The total phosphorylation level of HDAC2 is increased significantly
by simultaneous treatment with okadaic acid, a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
inhibitor. In our models, we also observed that the catalytic subunit of PP2A
interacted physically with HDAC2. PP2A reduced both phosphorylation and the
intrinsic activity of HDAC2 significantly. Overexpression of PP2A blocked
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by HDAC2 (Min et al., unpublished
observations).

We (19, 27, 34-37, 39, 46) and others (38, 40, 41, 45) have demonstrated the functional relevance of HDAC2 and cardiac
remodeling and HDAC2 may be a promising target for cardiac remodeling. One may
argue, however, that unwanted effect would be expected given the ubiquitous
distribution of HDAC2, which may restrict its therapeutic use. However, as shown in
the previous report (41), HDAC2 is
exclusively expressed in the developing heart. Moreover, considering that HDACs work
in a combinatorial fashion with diverse transcription factors that determine the
downstream target and that these combinations would vary greatly depending on
cellular context and/or disease processes, tissue specificity would be achieved by
simultaneous modulation of these factors as well as their cellular contexts. Thus,
understanding these complex pathways and the functions of the associated
transcription factors would be of great importance for the specificity of HDAC
modulation. In addition, it is important to understand the PTM of HDAC and their
regulators. On the basis of knowledge that intrinsic of HDACs can be regulated by
dynamics of diverse PTMs, modifiers of HDACs could also provide notable therapeutic
targets by minimizing the adverse effects of HDACi. Indeed, we have already shown
that anti-hypertrophic properties of CK2 inhibitors, which interfered with HDAC2
phosphorylation, was as effective as HDACi in vivo
(35). Like CK2 inhibitors, certain chemicals
targeted downstream of HDAC2 could be important for the treatment of cardiac
remodeling.
