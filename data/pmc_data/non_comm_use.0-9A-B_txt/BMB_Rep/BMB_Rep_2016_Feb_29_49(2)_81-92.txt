INTRODUCTION
The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly
Drosophila melanogaster have been used as two most popular
invertebrate models for studying aging and longevity (1, 2). In particular,
their short lifespan together with their low cost and easy handling has established
these invertebrates as excellent systems for research on molecular mechanisms
regulating animal aging. Many important discoveries regarding evolutionarily
conserved aging-regulatory pathways have been made using C. elegans
and D. melanogaster. One of such pathways is the
insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 signaling (IIS) pathway, which was first
shown to regulate longevity in C. elegans, and subsequently
confirmed by using D. melanogaster. Importantly, the findings using
these two invertebrate model organisms stimulated research on the role of IIS in
mammalian aging, and led to discoveries showing that IIS also regulates aging in
mammals, including mice and humans (3, 4). In this review, we will describe which
components of IIS regulate lifespan, and how IIS modulates aging processes in these
two model organisms. We will also review endocrine signaling and the importance of
insulin-like peptides (ILPs) for systemic longevity regulation. Overall, our review
will provide useful information regarding the conserved roles of IIS pathway in the
aging of model organisms, which will eventually pave the way for understanding the
mystery of human aging.

THE ROLE OF INSULIN/IGF-1 SIGNALING IN C. elegans AGING
Insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway components that regulate the lifespan of
C. elegans
The insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) pathway contains many evolutionarily conserved
components that regulate aging (Fig. 1).
The gerontogenes daf-2 and age-1 encode the
sole insulin/IGF-1 receptor and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) (5, 6), respectively. DAF-2 and AGE-1 are two key upstream components of
IIS that regulate various physiological aspects, including aging and adult
lifespan. Two of the most important discoveries in the field of aging research
were perhaps the findings demonstrating that inhibition of
daf-2 or age-1 dramatically extended
lifespan in C. elegans
(7-9). These discoveries stimulated many subsequent studies on the role
of IIS in lifespan regulation, not only in C. elegans but also
in D. melanogaster and mammals.

Fig. 1. Conserved longevity-regulatory components of insulin/IGF-1 signaling
pathway in C. elegans and D.
melanogaster. Insulin-like peptides (ILPs in
Caenorhabditis elegans and DILPs in
Drosophila melanogaster) bind to insulin/IGF-1
receptor (DAF-2 in C. elegans and dInR in D.
melanogaster) and lead to its phosphorylation. Inhibition
of insulin/IGF-1 receptor results in decreased binding to the insulin
receptor substrate (IST-1 in C. elegans and CHICO in
D. melanogaster), which in turn decreases the
activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (AGE-1 in C.
elegans and PI3K in D. melanogaster) that
converts PIP2 to PIP3; conversely, the PTEN
phosphatase (DAF-18 in C. elegans and dPTEN in
D. melanogaster) functions to antagonize the
activity of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase by converting PIP3
to PIP2. Decreased PIP3 levels lead to decreased
activities of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK-1 in C.
elegans and dPDK1 in D. melanogaster) and
the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase B (AKT-1/-2 in C.
elegans and dAkt1 in D. melanogaster), and
the activation of downstream transcription factor FOXO (DAF-16 in
C. elegans and dFOXO in D.
melanogaster). Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling in
C. elegans also increases the activities of heat
shock transcription factor-1 (HSF-1) and SKN-1 (NRF2). These
transcription factors regulate the expression of target genes, which
contribute to longevity.
IIS transduces signals through a combination of wellorganized sequential events,
depending on environmental conditions. Under favorable conditions, IIS is
activated and this confers normal development and adult lifespan. Specifically,
agonist insulin-like peptides (ILPs) bind to their receptor, DAF-2, which in
turn recruits an insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/IST-1 (10). This leads to the activation of the AGE-1/PI3K,
which increases the level of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) (5, 11); this event is antagonistically balanced by DAF-18/PTEN
phosphatase that promotes the conversion of PIP3 to
phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) (12-19). The signals provided by PIP3 activate the downstream
kinase cascade, composed of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
(PDK-1) (2), protein kinase B (AKT-1/-2)
(21), and serum- and
glucocorticoid-inducible kinase-1 (SGK-1) (22; but see also 23, 24). This in turn phosphorylates and
inactivates DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor, by promoting its nucleusto-cytosol
translocation (22, 25-30).
Conversely, in unfavorable conditions, IIS is down-regulated and leads to the
activation of DAF-16/FOXO via enhancing its translocation from the cytoplasm to
the nucleus, where it switches on the expression of genes that promote
longevity. Thus, C. elegans IIS pathway acts as a system in
which many components transduce signals to modulate the aging processes,
depending on extracellular conditions.

Three most important downstream lifespan-regulatory transcription factors of IIS
that have been identified so far are DAF-16/FOXO, heat shock transcription
factor 1 (HSF-1) and SKN-1/nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NRF2). DAF-16/FOXO
regulates aging processes downstream of the canonical IIS cascade as described
above. In addition, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK/JNK-1) (31), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK/AAK-2) (32-34), and Ste20-like protein kinase (MST1/CST-1) (35) activate DAF-16/FOXO via
phosphorylation. Other non-kinase proteins have been shown to regulate
C. elegans DAF-16/FOXO. A serine/threonine-protein
phosphatase 4-regulatory subunit SMK-1 (36), and an RNA helicase HEL-1 (37), extend longevity by acting together with DAF-16/FOXO.
DAF-16/FOXO is acetylated by an acetyl-transferase CBP-1/CREB binding protein
(CBP), whose inhibition leads to constitutive nuclear localization of
DAF-16/FOXO (38). Host cell factor 1
(HCF-1) and enhancer of akt-1 null 7 (EAK-7) are other
regulatory factors that inhibit DAF-16/FOXO activity without altering its
subcellular localization (39-41). DAF-16/FOXO also interacts with two
highly homologous 14-3-3 protein family members, FTT-1/PAR-5 and FTT-2 (42, 43). The 14-3-3 proteins modulate the interaction between
DAF-16/FOXO and other co-factors, such as SIR-2.1/sirtuin 1, an NAD-dependent
deacetylase (42, 44). These diverse interactions and posttranslational
modifications may help differentially regulate the activity of DAF-16/FOXO upon
various environmental changes.

Downstream targets of DAF-16/FOXO were identified by using various approaches
such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, bioinformatics, microarray and mRNA
sequencing (31, 45-51). The
DAF-16/FOXO target genes collectively contribute to longevity by enhancing
cellular maintenance in animals with reduced IIS. Since many regulatory modes
and targets of FOXO transcription factors are conserved among species, the
longevity-regulatory modes of C. elegans DAF-16/FOXO are likely
to be recapitulated in IIS-medicated longevity in mammals.

SKN-1, an oxidative stress-responsive NRF transcription factor, also contributes
to the longevity conferred by reduced IIS (52, 53). Similar to
DAF-16/FOXO, SKN-1 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by phosphorylation via the
canonical IIS protein kinases, including AKT-1/-2 (52). SKN-1 mediates the expression of genes involved in
detoxification and stress responses (52,
54-63). Overexpression of constitutively nuclear SKN-1 extends lifespan
in a DAF-16/FOXO-independent manner (52). SKN-1 also promotes protein homeostasis through regulating
proteasome production, which contributes to a longer lifespan (55, 57, 64). In addition, SKN-1
promotes longevity of animals with reduced IIS through remodeling of
extracellular matrix (65).

HSF-1 is another important transcription factor acting downstream of IIS, and is
essential for the longevity of animals with reduced IIS (66-70). The
function of HSF-1 in promoting longevity and reducing proteotoxicity is closely
associated with the conserved IIS pathway. Genetic inhibition of
hsf-1 accelerates tissue aging, thereby shortening the
lifespan (71). Knockdown of
hsf-1 also suppresses the longevity phenotype of
daf-2 and age-1 mutants; conversely, the
overexpression of hsf-1 is sufficient to extend lifespan (51, 66, 67, 69, 72, 73). HSF-1 binds to
specific regions of DNA containing heat shock elements (HSEs) (74-76). The binding of HSF-1 to HSEs triggers the induction of genes
encoding molecular chaperones, such as HSP-70 and HSP-16, whose overexpression
extends lifespan (77, 78). Thus, HSF-1 appears to lead to
longevity by upregulating the chaperone network that enhances the proper folding
of various proteins (66, 67). DDL-1 (the C.
elegans homolog of human coiled-coil domain-containing protein 53:
CCDC53), DDL-2 (the C. elegans homolog of human Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein and SCAR homolog: WASH2), and HSB-1 (heat-shock factor binding
protein-1), form a complex with HSF-1 and regulate lifespan by inhibiting the
activity of HSF-1 (69). Overall, HSF-1
and SKN-1 appear to promote longevity mainly through the induction of target
genes that increase resistance to various stresses.

Systemic regulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling-mediated longevity in
C. elegans
As the IIS pathway consists of many potential endocrine components, it is likely
that IIS regulates lifespan in a systemic manner. The C.
elegans genome encodes 40 ILPs, which appear to act as
extracellular endocrine signals in C. elegans
(79, 80). Functional studies on several ILPs, including
ins-6
(81, 82), ins-7
(47, 83, 84) and
daf-28
(80, 85, 86), have been
conducted. However, the majority of the 40 ILPs, which potentially regulate
longevity and development, are yet to be characterized in detail. This is
perhaps because many possible combinations of the interactions between ILPs and
DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 receptor make it difficult to dissect the specific functions
of each ILP. A recent study indicates that ILPs can function in a combinatorial
manner to coordinate various physiological processes (87). This finding is different from the previous notion
that ILPs generally confer a functional redundancy due to their structural
similarities (79, 80, 88-91). Therefore, some individuals or a
group of ILPs may have a profound effect on longevity.

Most of the ILPs are expressed in neurons, although some ILPs are expressed in
non-neuronal tissues such as hypodermis and intestine (79-83, 88-90, 92-94). Overexpression of ins-7 in the
intestine decreases the activity of DAF-16/FOXO in non-intestinal tissues and
shortens lifespan (83), suggesting an
endocrine tissue-nonautonomous role of INS-7 in longevity. The expression of
daf-2 in neurons is largely responsible for the longevity
of daf-2 mutants (95,
96), pointing to the endocrine
regulation of longevity by neuronal IIS. Together, it appears that IIS can
systemically regulate lifespan from various tissues, via endocrine
signaling.

The role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in C. elegans physiology
and age-related disease models
C. elegans that is exposed to unfavorable environmental
conditions such as reduced food availability, extreme temperatures and a high
population during development, enters an alternative diapause stage called dauer
(97, 98). IIS is one of extensively studied signaling pathways
that govern this dauer developmental decision (Fig. 2). Genetic inhibition of daf-2 or
age-1, which extends adult lifespan, can cause constitutive
dauer formation even under favorable conditions (97, 98). This dauer
formation requires key downstream effectors in IIS, including DAF-18/PTEN and
DAF-16/FOXO (97, 98). Reduced IIS activates a transcriptional program
through DAF-16/FOXO, which leads to dauer formation. These findings raise the
possibility that IIS may regulate dauer decision and lifespan using same
effectors. However, the regulation of longevity and dauer formation by IIS can
be uncoupled. Neuronal DAF-16/FOXO plays a more important role in the dauer
decision than in lifespan regulation, whereas intestinal DAF-16/FOXO has a more
profound effect on the lifespan extension than on the dauer decision (99). In addition, IIS pathway regulates
the lifespan exclusively during adulthood, while it regulates the dauer
formation during early larval development (100). Thus, spatiotemporal regulation of IIS differentially
influences two separate aspects of animal physiology, development and adult
lifespan.

Fig. 2. The role of insulin/IGF-1 signaling in C. elegans
physiology and age-related disease models. Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS)
regulates dauer formation, stress resistance, and the models of
age-related diseases in C. elegans. Reduced IIS
promotes dauer formation and enhances resistance to various external and
internal stresses, and pathogens. Inhibition of IIS also ameliorates
defects associated with various human disease models. These protective
effects of reduced IIS contribute to organismal longevity.
IIS also regulates resistance to a variety of stresses. C.
elegans with reduced IIS displays enhanced resistance to
environmental stresses such as oxidative stress (Fig. 2) (52, 101- 103), heat stress (104-106), hypoxic stress (107, 108),
osmotic stress (109, 110), ultraviolet (UV) stress (36, 111), and heavy metal toxicity (112). Moreover, reduced IIS promotes better maintenance of internal
homeostasis against cytosolic proteotoxicity (66, 113) and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress (114). The key
downstream transcription factors of IIS that contribute to longevity, including
DAF-16/FOXO (25, 26, 36, 66, 103, 106-116), HSF-1 (66, 67) and SKN-1
(52, 53), regulate these stress resistance phenotypes as well.
Thus, proper regulation of IIS is crucial for the protection of C.
elegans from both external and internal stresses.

Bacteria serve as a major food source for C. elegans, and are
likely to be abundant in the natural habitats of C. elegans,
such as rotten fruits. Therefore, it seems likely that C.
elegans constantly comes in contact with various bacterial species,
which may include pathogenic bacteria. To combat infection by pathogens,
C. elegans is equipped with an innate immune system, and
IIS is one of the most prominent innate immune signaling pathways (117). C. elegans with
reduced IIS displays enhanced pathogen resistance, which is mediated by
DAF-16/FOXO, HSF-1, and SKN-1 (84, 118-122). Reduced IIS leads to the induction of several antimicrobial
genes (47), and reduction in bacterial
packing in the intestine (123).
Interestingly, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a popular model
bacterial pathogen in C. elegans, activates IIS to counteract
the host immunity (124). Therefore, IIS
may be located at the front of constant battles between the host C.
elegans and its bacterial pathogens

Because of its powerful genetics, C. elegans has also been
widely used for modeling various human diseases, especially neurodegenerative
diseases. The disease models of C. elegans were established by
generating transgenic animals expressing various human disease-associated
proteins; these include Î²-amyloid peptides (AÎ²) for Alzheimerâs
disease (125-127), polyglutamine (polyQ) proteins for Huntingtonâs
disease (128-132), Î±-synuclein for Parkinsonâs disease (133-137), and a mutant superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS) (138-141). The Alzheimerâs disease model
C. elegans, which expresses AÎ²1-42 in body
wall muscles, is paralyzed and displays the accumulation of protein aggregates
(68, 125, 142). Reduced
IIS relieves these phenotypes via activating DAF-16/FOXO and HSF-1 (68), and inducing autophagic degradation
of the protein aggregates (142). Reduced
IIS also suppresses the short lifespan of AÎ²1-42-expressing
animals (68). The C.
elegans model for Huntingtonâs disease has been widely used for
studying proteotoxicity caused by aggregation of polyQ proteins (113, 128-131, 143-150). The polyQ-expressing worms display progressive
neurodegeneration, neuronal dysfunction, retarded development, and defective
motility (113, 128-131, 143-150). The daf-2 and age-1
mutations ameliorate a gradual age-dependent increase in toxicity resulting from
polyQ aggregation through HSF-1 and DAF-16/FOXO (66, 113, 132, 146, 149). Parkinsonâs
disease patients suffer from degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which display
accumulated protein inclusions that contain Î±-synuclein (151). Similarly, the C. elegans models
for Parkinsonâs disease, which express wild-type or mutant human
Î±-synuclein proteins in neurons, display the loss of dopaminergic neurons
(133, 134, 137, 152). Reduced IIS by
daf-2 mutations dramatically suppresses this
neurodegeneration phenotype (152). ALS,
which is characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration (153), has also been studied using a
C. elegans model (138-141). Familial ALS is
associated with mutations in the gene encoding SOD1 (154, 155).
Neuronal expression of a mutant human SOD1 causes locomotion defects (140) and paralysis (141) in C. elegans.
daf-2 mutations protect the ALS model worms from the
paralysis (141). Collectively, the
results using C. elegans models indicate that IIS plays a
crucial role in the pathophysiology of a majority of neurodegenerative diseases
(Fig. 2). These findings imply that
IIS modulates protein homeostasis to regulate normal neuronal functions, which
may be essential for a long and healthy life.

INSULIN/IGF-1 SIGNALING PATHWAY AND Drosophila melanogaster
AGING
Insulin/IGF-1 signaling components implicated in the longevity of D.
melanogaster
The IIS pathway of Drosophila melanogaster consists of many
components (Fig. 1), including the
insulin/IGF receptor (dInR), the insulin receptor substrate (CHICO), the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) Dp110/p60, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
protein kinase 1 (dPDK1) and the protein kinase B (PKB), also known as dAkt1,
and the transcription factor Drosophila FOXO (dFOXO) (156-171). The activation mechanism of the IIS pathway in
Drosophila has substantial similarities to that in
C. elegans. Basically, the activation of dInR leads to
up-regulation of a cascade of intracellular phosphorylation events, subsequently
leading to the phosphorylation of dFOXO protein (160-162). dInR conveys
signals from Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs), directly
to PI3K or to CHICO, the insulin receptor substrate (156, 172). PI3K,
which converts PIP2 to PIP3, has a catalytic subunit,
Dp110, and a regulatory subunit, Dp60 (158, 159). The action of
PI3K is antagonized by the activity of dPTEN (173-175), which catalyzes
PIP3 to PIP2. PIP3 acts as an intracellular
second messenger that activates a cascade of protein kinases, including dPDK1
and PKB/dAkt, which subsequently lead to the phosphorylation and the nuclear
exclusion of dFOXO (162, 170). Conversely, reduced IIS through
dInR or CHICO mutations, or overexpression
of dPTEN, causes the translocation of dFOXO from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus, where it up-regulates genes involved in longevity and stress
resistance (160, 162, 176, 177).

In Drosophila, the IIS pathway regulates various physiological
processes, including lifespan, stress responses, growth and development. Genetic
inhibition of negative regulators of dFOXO, including several DILPs (178, 179), dInR (180), the
IRS/CHICO (181, 182), or 14-3-3 epsilon (183), extends the lifespan of Drosophila.
Conversely, overexpression of antagonistic IIS regulators, such as dPTEN or
dFOXO, also extends the lifespan and/or delay heart aging (177, 184-186; but
see also 187). Overall, these findings using
Drosophila have remarkable similarities with those of
C. elegans, highlighting the evolutionarily conserved
nature of lifespan regulation by IIS components.

Endocrine regulation of lifespan by Drosophila insulin/IGF-1
signaling
The Drosophila melanogaster genome encodes eight DILPs (172, 188-190). The
dilp genes display distinct temporal expression patterns.
For example, dilp2 is expressed from embryo to adult stages,
whereas dilp4 is expressed only during development prior to
adulthood (172, 179, 191-195). In addition, the expression sites of
the eight dilp genes are diverse (196). Notably, the major site of DILP production is the
median neurosecretory cells (mNSCs) in the brain, also called insulin-producing
cells (IPCs), where dilp1, dilp2,
dilp3 and dilp5 are expressed (172, 179, 191-194).

Cell non-autonomous regulation of lifespan by Drosophila IIS was
proposed based on findings using tissue-specific overexpression of IIS
components. Up-regulation of dFOXO in the adult head fat body is sufficient to
promote longevity and oxidative stress resistance (177). Muscle-specific overexpression of either dPTEN,
dFOXO, or 4E-BP (a dFOXO target), also significantly increases lifespan (184). The ablation of IPCs lengthens
lifespan (179, 197), which corroborates the endocrine regulation of
lifespan by IIS; this is also reminiscent of lifespan extension by the ablation
of sensory neurons in C. elegans
(reviewed in 198). Among the DILPs
expressed in the IPCs, DILP2 has been extensively explored for its implication
in lifespan regulation, since it has the highest homology with human insulin
(172, 177-179, 199-201). The dilp2 null-mutant flies live long (178), and the expression of
dilp2 in the IPCs is reduced by the activation of dFOXO
(177, 199). Therefore, Drosophila IIS appears
to regulate the expression of DILPs and longevity via a feedback mechanism.
Furthermore, reduced dilp2 expression and inhibited IIS in the
fat body are associated with lifespan extension conferred by transgenic
expression of a dominant-negative p53 (200). DILP6, which is predominantly produced in the fat body, is
another endocrine lifespan regulator (200-204). Surprisingly,
overexpression of dilp6 in the abdominal fat body leads to the
repression of dilp2 in the brain, suggesting synergistic
effects on lifespan regulation by a potential dInR antagonist DILP6 and an
agonist DILP2 (204). Collectively,
lifespan regulation by IIS is controlled systemically by the action of DILPs
that transmit signals, at least between the brain and fat body.

CONCLUSIONS
In this review, we have described findings regarding mechanisms by which IIS
influences lifespan in two representative invertebrate models, C.
elegans and D. melanogaster. The roles of many IIS
components in aging are remarkably well conserved between C.
elegans and D. melanogaster, and the intervention of
the IIS leads to an extended lifespan in both animals. This suggests that the role
of IIS in aging is likely to be conserved across phyla beyond these two species.
Indeed, many findings using these invertebrate models have led to the discoveries
demonstrating that changes in IIS can extend lifespan in mammals. For example,
heterozygous IGF1 receptor- knockout mice (Igf1rï¼/â)
live longer than wild-type (205), and lower
circulating IGF1 level correlates with mouse longevity (206). In addition, genetic variants of IIS components,
including IGF1 receptor and FOXO3A, are associated with human longevity (4, 207). Thus, the evidence for the evolutionarily conserved nature of
IIS-mediated longevity is extremely strong, ranging from invertebrates to
humans.

Both C. elegans and D. melanogaster have been
invaluable for the identification of IIS components and their roles in aging at the
organism level. Still, much remains to be discovered regarding the regulatory
mechanisms of aging and longevity at the molecular level. As we can make new
discoveries regarding organismal aging using these invertebrate models much faster
than using vertebrates, C. elegans and D.
melanogaster will continue to serve as indispensable tools for
broadening our knowledge in aging. The progresses made by using these invertebrate
models will eventually lead to the promotion of long and healthy human lives, and
the prevention of age-associated diseases.
