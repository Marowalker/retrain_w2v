widespread cardiovascular disease. Recent studies suggest that oxidative damage
occurs in VSMCs and induces atherosclerosis. Here, we analyzed oxidative damage
repair in VSMCs and found that VSMCs are hypersensitive to oxidative damage.
Further analysis showed that oxidative damage repair in VSMCs is suppressed by a
low level of poly (ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), a key post-translational
modification in oxidative damage repair. The low level of PARylation is not
caused by the lack of PARP-1, the major poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activated by
oxidative damage. Instead, the expression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase,
PARG, the enzyme hydrolyzing poly(ADP-ribose), is significantly higher in VSMCs
than that in the control cells. Using PARG inhibitor to suppress PARG activity
facilitates oxidative damage-induced PARylation as well as DNA damage repair.
Thus, our study demonstrates a novel molecular mechanism for oxidative
damage-induced VSMCs death. This study also identifies the use of PARG
inhibitors as a potential treatment for atherosclerosis. [BMB Reports 2015;

==== Body
INTRODUCTION
Atherosclerosis, the leading cause of cardiovascular disease, is formerly considered
a chronic inflammatory disease. However, increasing evidence suggests that oxidative
stress-induced DNA damage induces the apoptosis of VSMCs during the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis (1, 2). For example, the level of 8-oxoG, a DNA adduct from
oxidative damage, is significantly higher in VSMCs of the aorta wall (3, 4). However, in response to DNA damage, cells usually activate DNA damage
repair systems to repair DNA lesions. Thus, it is unclear why VSMCs are sensitive to
oxidative damage.

Oxidative DNA damage is usually induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) primarily
generated from normal intracellular metabolism in mitochondria and peroxisomes. A
number of external hazards such as ionizing radiation, chemicals and UVA solar light
can also trigger ROS production (5, 6). These active free radicals attack
double-stranded DNA, inducing various types of DNA lesions, including DNA
single-stand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs), which may lead to
genomic instability (7, 8). To cope with these threats, cells have
evolved DNA damage response systems to detect and repair DNA lesions. As one of the
earliest alarm systems and regulators in DNA damage response, poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)
participates in the repair of numerous types of DNA damage including SSBs and DSBs
(9, 10). Thus, the cellular metabolism of PAR is critical for DNA damage
response and genomic stability. The reaction of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation)
is catalyzed by a group of PAR polymerases (PARPs). Using NAD+ as the
substrate, PARPs covalently adds ADP-ribose to the side chains of arginine, aspartic
acid, and glutamic acid residues in target proteins. After catalyzing the first
ADP-ribose onto the proteins, other ADP-riboses can be covalently linked and the
continuous reactions produce both linear and branched polymers known as PAR (11, 12). The structure of PAR has been well characterized: the ADP-ribose
unit in the polymer is linked by glycosidic ribose-ribose 1’-2’ bonds. The chain
length is heterogeneous and can reach around 200 units with 20-50 units in each
branch (13). PARylation is regulated not
only by PARPs but also by PARG, the major enzyme for hydrolyzing PAR. In response to
DNA damage, PARG is recruited to DNA lesions and digest PAR within a few
minutes.

Although PARylation has been examined both in vivo and in vitro, the metabolism of
PAR in VSMCs remains elusive. In this study, we examined PAR metabolism following
oxidative DNA damage in mouse aortic VSMCs (MOVAS), and used mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) as the control cell line. Similar to MOVAS, MEFs can be used to
study DNA damage (14, 15) and originate from mesenchymal stem cells with the ability
to differentiate into myocytes (16, 17). With mass spectrometry, we quantitatively
measured the level of PAR in MOVAS, and found that that it was relatively low. Our
study also suggests that the PARG level in MOVAS is relatively high, which
suppresses PARylation following oxidative damage, and thus affect DNA damage repair.
Suppression of PARG by the PARG inhibitor facilitates PARylation and DNA damage
repair in MOVAS. Thus, PARG inhibitor treatment could be a potential therapeutic
approach for arteriosclerosis.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
H2O2 induces DNA damage in MOVAS
ROS is one of the most common by-products during metabolism and induces SSBs
(18). Under physiological
conditions, ROS-induced SSBs can be repaired via the base excision repair
pathway (19). However, when two SSBs
happen in close proximity, or when the DNA-replication apparatus encounters a
SSB, DSBs, the more deleterious genomic lesion, are formed by overwhelming ROS
(20, 21). Excessive ROS imposes an oxidative stress condition
on vascular cells especially VSMCs, triggering the apoptosis of VSMCs and
arteriosclerosis (22, 23). It is well known that ROS can be
generated by externally adding H2O2
(24). Thus, to study the oxidative DNA
damage in MOVAS, we treated MOVAS with H2O2, and employed
alkaline comet assays (25) to detect
SSBs and DSBs in the cells. Damaged genomic DNA fragments migrated from nuclei
during electrophoresis Fig. 1A). Shorter
DNA fragments move faster in electrophoresis, therefore, by measuring the
migrated length of DNA fragments, we can quantitatively examine the repair of
oxidative damage. To our surprise, we found that the repair in MOVAS was much
slower than that in MEFs since much shorter DNA fragments were found in MOVAS
especially at 60 minutes (MOVAS: 7.18 ± 0.99, MEFs: 2.68 ± 0.44, P = 0.000) and
120 minutes (MOVAS: 2.87 ± 0.24, MEFs: 0.70 ± 0.16, P = 0.000) following
H2O2 treatment (Fig.
1A, B).

Fig. 1. H2O2-induced DSBs activate DNA damage repair in
MOVAS. (A) Representative images of alkaline comet assays at 20, 60, and
120 min following H2O2 treatment. Comet tails were
found in H2O2 treated cells. (B) Quantification of
DNA damage by tail moment of comet assay treated with or without
H2O2. Tail moments were measured from three
independent experiments with at least 30 cells at single time points per
sample. (C) Cells were treated with various concentrations of
H2O2, and visualized by immunostaining with
anti-γH2AX (red) following 1 h
H2O2 treatment. Nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33258 (blue). (D) The number of γH2AX foci
in cells was counted (n = 15). The error bars represent the standard
deviation, *P ＜ 0.05.
The H2O2-induced DSBs in MOVAS and MEFs were examined by
staining the cells with anti-γH2AX antibody. We observed
γH2AX nuclear foci in MOVAS, suggesting that DSBs
occurred in MOVAS following oxidative damage (the number of foci were 2.00
± 1.75, 8.86 ± 2.21, 25.03 ± 7.93, 36.13 ± 7.06 per cell
from the control group to each H2O2 group). Meanwhile, we
found little γH2AX foci in MEFs damage (the number of foci
were 2.20 ± 2.10, 3.20 ± 2.05, 3.30 ± 3.06, 2.80 ± 2.77 per
cell from the control group to each H2O2 group) (Fig. 1C, D). Thus, these results suggest
that oxidative damage-induced DSBs were not repaired in a timely manner in MOVAS
unlike in MEFs, which may partly explain the molecular mechanism of VSMC death
and arteriosclerosis.

PARylation is suppressed in MOVAS in response to oxidative DNA damage
Next, we asked why MOVAS failed to repair all the oxidative lesions. We examined
PARylation, because it is an immediate and dramatic posttranslational
modification in response to DNA damage. PAR is a polymer of repeating ADP-ribose
units with varying length and branches. Thus, quantitatively measuring
PARylation is limited by the heterogeneous format of PAR. To overcome the
limitation, we measured the amount of single ADP-ribose using mass spectrometry.
We cut phosphate diester bonds within each ADP-ribose and removed the phosphate
group by phosphotases to obtain a ribosyladenosine unit from PAR (Fig. 2A). Thus, we were able to accurately
measure the amount of ribosyladenosine units from PAR with a molecular weight of
400.146 by Q-TOF mass spectrometry. As seen in Fig. 2B, mass spectrometry peaks from both MOVAS and MEFs showed
identical molecular weights of 400.146, corresponding to ribosyladenosine. To
compare the relative abundance of ribosyladenosine from MOVAS and MEFs, we used
the peak height of ribosyladenosine. We found that H2O2
induced a higher ribosyladenosine peak value in MEFs than in MOVAS [before and
after H2O2 treatment ratio of ribosyladenosine peak:
MOVAS: 1.61 ± 0.03, MEFs: 3.31 ± 0.05 (Fig.
2B, C)]. This result suggests that the amount of PAR generated in
MEFs in response to oxidative DNA damage is greater than in MOVAS. To validate
the results, we introduced two other cell lines, mouse aortic endothelial cells
(MECs) and skeletal muscle cells (MSCs), and used dot blot assays to determine
the amount of PAR in the cells. We found that the amount of PAR in MOVAS was
much lower than in the other three cell lines after H2O2
treatment (Fig. 2D). Meanwhile, we
investigated PAR synthesis in the wire-injured mice model, which is reported to
induce oxidative damage (26, 27). The PAR-positive percentage in MECs
was consistently higher than in MOVAS after wire injury (Fig. 2E, F). Thus, a correlation between PAR synthesis and
DNA damage repair in VSMCs was observed in both cell and animal experiments,
further suggesting that PARylation plays an important role for oxidative DNA
damage repair in VSMCs.

Fig. 2. PAR synthesis is suppressed in MOVAS. (A) Structure of PAR. In
response to oxidant DNA damage, PARP-1 hydrolyzes NAD+,
releases nicotinamide and one proton (H+), and transfers the
ADP-ribose moiety (blue) to protein acceptors. Subsequent digestion of
PAR with phosphodiesterase (red scissors) and phosphotase (purple
scissors) releases ribosyladenosine (green). (B) Ribosyladenosine levels
in MOVAS and MEFs were measured by Q-TOF mass spectrometry, and
arbitrary units are shown in the histogram (C), the error bars represent
the standard deviation, *P＜0.05. (D) Following 20 min
H2O2 treatment, PAR was purified from MOVAS,
MEFs, MECs and MSCs, then examined by dot blot using anti-PAR antibody.
β-actin was examined by western blot and used as the loading
control. (E) Immunofluorescence staining of PAR in artery tissue (Scale
bar = 100 ㎛). (F) The number of PAR positive cells are shown in
the histogram. Error bars represent the standard deviation (n = 3),
*P＜0.05.
High expression of PARG decreases PARylation in MOVAS
We next examined why the level of PAR in MOVAS was significantly lower than in
the other cells. Since DNA damage-induced PAR is mainly synthesized by PARP-1,
the founding member in PARPs family (13), we first examined the expression of PARP-1 in MOVAS and MEFs by
immunofluorescence staining. We co-stained PAR and PARP-1 in the nuclei of both
MOVAS and MEFs. As shown in Fig. 3A,
although the level of PAR was significantly higher in MEFs, the expression level
of PARP-1 in MOVAS and MEFs did not show significant differences. To further
examine the level of PARP-1, we analyzed PARP-1 in the above four cell lines by
western blot (Fig. 3B). Again, we did not
observe significant differences in PARP-1’s expression in the control and
H2O2 treated cells. PARP-1 is the most important
enzyme involved in oxidative DNA repair (28), which normally occurs in the cell nucleus. When DNA damage
occurs, PARP-1 is activated and recruited to the damage sites, but the amount
does not increase (29).Besides PARP-1,
PARG, the enzyme that regulates PAR degradation, also plays an important role in
PAR metabolism. To characterize PARG, we examined the expression of PARG
following H2O2 treatment. Under physiological conditions,
the expression level of PARG was relatively low, and there was no significant
difference in PARG expression in the MOVAS, MEFs, MECs and MSCs. However, upon
treatment with H2O2, we found that the expression of PARG
increased in varying degrees in different cells, and oxidative stress induced
higher expression of PARG in MOVAS (Fig.
3B). Thus, it is likely that the high level of PARG expression in
MOVAS is responsible for the low level of PAR in response to DNA damage.

dashed lines in enlarged boxes to denote the localization of PARP-1 and
PAR in nuclei. (B) The expression of PARP-1 and PARG in cells were
examined at 1 h following H2O2 treatment,
β-actin was used as the protein loading control. The error bars
represent the standard deviation.
PARG inhibitor rescues MOVAS from oxidative stress-induced cell death
To further examine the role of PARG, we treated the cells with the PARG inhibitor
GLTN. In the presence of the PARG inhibitor, the amount of PAR increased
significantly in MOVAS following H2O2 treatment (Fig. 4A). Thus, we could use PARG
inhibitors to suppress PARG-dependent PAR degradation in MOVAS. Next, we
wondered whether the PAR-dependent DNA damage repair is enhanced in the presence
of the PARG inhibitor. As seen in Fig.
4B, C, the PARG inhibitor significantly reduced oxidative stress-induced
DNA damage in MOVAS as the number of short DNA fragments was significantly
reduced during the 30 min recovery following H2O2
treatment (Control group: 11.03 ± 1.98, inhibitor group: 5.11 ± 1.91, P =
0.000). Moreover, the number of oxidative stress-induced DSBs were lower with
the PARG inhibitor treatment as the number of γH2AX foci was remarkably reduced
(Control group: 38.20 ± 2.77, inhibitor group: 16.20 ± 5.16, P = 0.000) (Fig. 4D, E). In addition, accumulative
evidence has proven that oxidative stress induces cell death (30), which appears to be a major
molecular pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (31). Thus, we wondered whether inhibition of PARG could suppress
MOVAS death from oxidative stress. As shown in Fig. 4F, when MOVAS were incubated with H2O2
for 8 hours, 55.4 ± 2.2% of the cells underwent death as detected by the MTT
assay. However, when the cells were pretreated with 0.5, 5, and 25 ㎛ PARG
inhibitor (GLTN) for 1 hour, the percentage of cell death decreased to 52.2 ±
3.0% (P = 0.380), 41.6 ± 5.9% (P = 0.041), and 34.0 ± 7.1% (P = 0.000)
respectively, suggesting that the inhibition of PARG effectively rescues the
cells from oxidative stress-induced death.

Fig. 4. PARG inhibitor reduced oxidative DNA damage level and cell death. (A)
Following PARG treatment, PAR synthesis in MOVAS was examined by dot
blot. (B, C) MOVAS were pre-treated with or without PARG inhibitor
followed by H2O2. DNA breaks were examined at 20
min following H2O2 treatment by alkaline comet
assays. Tail moment was measured. (D, E) MOVAS were pre-treated with or
without PARG inhibitor. H2O2-induced DSBs were
examined and the foci of γH2AX in each cell were
counted (n = 15). (F) MOVAS were pre-treated with or without PARG
inhibitor and then exposed to 100 ㎛ H2O2.
Cell viability was evaluated using an MTT assay. The error bars
represent the standard deviation, *P ＜ 0.05.
Normally PARPs and PARG maintain the balance of PARylation. However, during
pathological events such as excessive and unrepairable oxidant DNA damage,
highly activated PARPs synthesize large amounts of PAR in a few seconds. The PAR
synthesis also triggers rapid PAR degradation with the over-activated PARG
within a few minutes following DNA damage. This vicious cycle not only impairs
DNA damage repair but also leads to intracellular ATP depletion and NAD (32, 33). Our results show that VSMCs death may result from excessive
PARG expression to impair PAR-dependence DNA damage repair. In recent years,
PARP-1 inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects on atherosclerosis,
and this effect is mainly associated with the maintenance of cellular NAD and
ATP level (33, 34). Similarly, suppression of PARG was likely to protect
cells from oxidative DNA damage and facilitated cell survival in our results. In
addition, PARG inhibitor protection is supported in the ischemic animal model
(35) and in cells (36). Here, we demonstrate that PARG
inhibitor treatment contributes to genomic stability and anti-oxidative stress
injury, and positively regulates the viability of VSMCs, which reveals a
potential therapeutic strategy for arteriosclerosis.

In conclusion, our study suggests that a high level of endogenous PARG in VSMCs
impairs oxidative DNA damage repair, inducing the death of VSMCs during
atherosclerosis. PARG inhibitor treatment suppresses PARG activity and
facilitates DNA damage repair in VSMCs by prolonging PARylation. Thus, PARG acts
as a mediator of cardiovascular disease, and PARylation may play a pivotal
protective role as an antioxidant defense mechanism by maintaining VSMCs
function under pathologic conditions of oxidative stress. Hence, PARG inhibitors
may provide a novel clinical treatment for suppressing arteriosclerosis caused
by oxidative damage.
