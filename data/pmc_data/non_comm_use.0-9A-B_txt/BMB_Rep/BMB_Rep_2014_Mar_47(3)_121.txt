==== Body
It is my great pleasure to open the first special issue of BMB Reports for Korean Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (KSBMB) Winter Workshop. The 5th KSBMB Winter Workshop was held in ‘High 1 Ski Resort’ with about 400 attendees. This year has 6 specialized sessions including Stem cell, Proteomics, Drug development, Molecular probes, Translational research, and Young Scientists with 22 outstanding speakers. In this special issue, we have 8 invited reviews from speakers in the 2013 and 2014 KSBMB Winter Workshop.

Some people may wonder why we need to make a special issue of KSBMB Winter Workshop. The purpose of this issue is for updating scientific theories and technical advances in the specialized professional fields. I wish that this special issue will be continued annually by the leading professionals in science. Since I took the job of the Chairman of the 4th KSBMB Winter Workshop in 2013, I realized that we needed to be identified ourselves as “Who are we?” and “What are we doing in the Ski Resort?”. It looks very funny raising a question in the Ski resort, but we are born Scientists. A series of meetings with committee members proposed the Winter Program that must be run by professional sessions. We are, in fact, professional scientists and doing science workshop with leading scientists.

This special issue invites 8 reviews including two reviews for Proteomics, two reviews for Drug development, one review of each for Stem cell research, Molecular probes, Translational research, and Young scientist.

The Proteomics review of “Small-molecule probes elucidate global enzyme activity in a proteomic context” by Prof. Lee Jun-Seok (Korea Institute of Science and Technology) summarizes the unique roles of small molecule probes in proteomics studies and highlights some recent examples in which this principle has been applied. Another review of “Proteomics Approaches for the Studies of Bone Metabolism” by Prof. Cho Je-Yoel (Seoul National University) briefly reviews recent major advances in the application of proteomics for bone biology especially in the aspect of cellular signaling.

The Drug development reviews are focused on trends in cancer research such as “Structural insights into the transcription-independent apoptotic pathway of p53” by Prof. Chi Seung-Wook (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology), which introduces structural basis for the transcription-independent apoptotic pathway of p53 and discusses its potential application to anticancer therapy. Another review introduces a new concept of cancer metabolism as “Tumor bioenergetics: An emerging Avenue for cancer metabolism targeted therapy” by Prof. Cheong Jae-Ho (Yonsei University College of Medicine) discusses the focused review of cancer energy metabolism and the therapeutic exploitation of glycolysis and OXPHOS as a novel anti-cancer strategy which reveal unexpected complexity and context-dependent metabolic adaptability complicating the development of effective strategies.

A review for Stem cell research “The potential of mesenchymal stem cells derived from amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid for neuronal regenerative therapy” by Prof. Kim Min Kyu (Chungnam National University) suggests potential of the mesenchymal stem cells identified from the amnionic membrane and amniotic fluid focus on cure of neuronal degenerative diseases.

A review for Molecular probe session may cover immunology research as well as nanotechnology. The review “In vitro and in vivo application of anti-cotinine antibody and cotinineconjugated compounds” by Prof. Chung Junho (Seoul National University College of Medicine) introduces the anti-cotinine IgG molecule that could be complexed with aptamers to form a novel affinity unit, and extended the in vivo half-life of aptamers, opening up the possibility of applying the same strategy to therapeutic peptides and chemical compounds.

A review for translational research invites the successful story of anti-cancer therapy using 4-1BB (CD137) as a Specific Target for Cancer Therapy{4-1BB (CD137; TNFRS9), an activation-induced costimulatory}. Dr. Kwon Byoung Se (National Cancer Center) introduces the various aspects of 4-1BB-mediated anti-tumor responses and the basis of such responses.

A review from Young scientists introduces “Short-chain fatty acid receptors and their therapeutic perspectives by Prof. Kim Sunhong (Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology). This review discusses about the synthetic modulators of GPR41 and GPR43 that are critical to understand the functions of the short chain fatty acid receptors as a therapeutic approach.

With the 5th Winter Workshop having been a great success, I am very proud to have served as a Chairman for the 4th and 5th KSBMB Winter Workshop. I am sure that Professor Cho Je-Yoel (Seoul National University) will be a successful Chairman of the 6th KSBMB Winter Workshop.
