crucial role in tumor progression. Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment
(TME) polarized to M2 is also a vital pathway for tumor deterioration. Here, we
explore the underlying role of macrophages in the effect of stress and E
promoting breast cancer growth. It was found that the weight and volume of tumor
in tumor bearing mice were increased, and dramatically accompanied with the
rising E level after chronic stress using social isolation. What is most
noteworthy, the number of M2 macrophages inside tumor was up-regulated with it.
The effects of E treatment appear to be directly related to the change of M2
phenotype is reproduced in vitro. Moreover, E receptor ADRβ2
involved in E promoting M2 polarization was comprehended simultaneously. Our
results imply psychological stress is influential on specific immune system,

==== Body
INTRODUCTION
Psychological stress by a mental assault is a risk factor for breast cancer (1, 2). Usually, the expression of norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E) will
increase significantly when the body is in acute or chronic stress state (3). The research enunciated recently that the
adrenergic system played pivotal roles in the initiation and promotion of tumor
caused by stress. Adrenergic receptors (ADRs) were expressed on multiple kinds of
cancers such as pancreatic cancer, oral squamous cell cancer, colon cancer, ovarian
cancer and breast cancer (4-7). Stress hormones NE and E could affect the
proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells and enhance VEGF expression (8, 9). ADRα2 was detected in a variety of human breast cancer cell lines.
Its expression level is positively related with the proliferation ability of breast
cancer cells and its function could be inhibited by the selective ADRα2
antagonist (10, 11). ADRβ was also detected to be activated in many
carcinomas. Khan S (12) demonstrated that
lipid-mobilizing factor (LMF) released by carcinoma cells could promote lipolysis
and give rise to cachexia and meanwhile promote tumor angiogenesis and VEGF, MMP-2
and MMP-9 expression through ADRβ-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, thus create a
vital microenvironment which suits for the metastasis and settling of carcinoma
cells. So for the states, we infer that stress related hormones and adrenergic
receptors can propel the tumor progression.

The macrophages were divided into two categories according to the secretion of IL-12
and IL-10; classical activated M1 macrophages (IL-12high) and alternative
activated M2 macrophages (IL-10high) (13). Tumor associated macrophages (TAM) belong to M2 phenotype (14). Clinical studies showed that in 80% of
the reported breast cancer cases, high density of M2 macrophages usually indicated
the poor prognosis (15). Tumor progression
will be effectively restrained as the number of M2 phenotype macrophages lowered in
tumor matrix (16).

Human stress experiments showed that stress could suppress the immune function (17). Moreover, that activated NE and ADR
subtypes (ADRα2, ADRβ1）could regulate TNFα and NO release in
macrophages through different signaling pathways was revealed (18-20). These suggest
that researchers have begun to focus on how stress affects the function of
macrophages, though the relationship between stress or related hormones and
macrophage phenotype transformation is still largely unknown.

On the basis of our previous studies (21,
22), we hypothesized that stress and
stress hormones (E) may boost the macrophage phenotype transformation from M1 to M2,
and ADRs activation may be required for the transformation. Herein, we presented
evidence to confirm this hypothesis. Moreover, further evidence of inhibition of
ADRβ2 leading to a decrease in the proliferation of cancer cells will be
initially presented.

RESULTS
In vivo social isolation stress induced breast cancer
growth
To know if in vivo chroic stress model using social isolation
induces breast cancer growth or not, one mouse was individually housed in one
cage as described in Materials and methods (Fig.
1A). Our results showed that tumor grow faster after chronic stress
and the tumor weight increased by 1.40 ± 0.13 g and the size 665 ± 35
mm3 (P ＜ 0.05, Fig.
1B). In particular, after dissected we found the size of the adrenal
gland have no difference by the observation of naked eyes (data not shown), but
the stress hormone E level in plasma of chronic stress group is visibly higher
than the control group (523 ± 18 ng/ml vs.124 ± 12 ng/ml, P ＜
0.05, Fig. 1B). Paraffin section dying
showed that CD206+ cells (marker for M2 macrophages) intratumor of
chronic stress group were obviously more than that of control group (Fig. 1C). Together, these above results
strongly suggested that E could effectively create larger numbers of M2
macrophages in tumor of stressed mice.

In vitro stress hormone E increased wound-healing and
migration ability of 4T1 cells
Next, to clarify the impact of E on the macrophages phenotype transformation and
then resulting in tumor metastasis, we performed functional wound healing and
Transwell migration assay, and it showed consistent results by both of the
methods. After being gashed, the 4T1 cells were cultured with supernatant from
RAW 264.7 cells that pretreated with different doses of E. As shown in Fig. 2A, we found that 1 μM and 5
μM E had a little effect in wound healing ability. 10 μM E could
induce the most significant wound closure by 21% ± 2.14% (P ＜ 0.05,
Fig. 2B). Therefore, 10 μM was
chosen for continued study. Then, we explored the effects of E treated
macrophages on the migratory behavior of 4T1 cells with Transwell assay. It was
found that 4T1 cells in TSN (the supernatant of 4T1 cells) treated-RAW 264.7
groups had much more migration cells than that in untreated-RAW 264.7 alone.
While, the number of 4T1 cells in TSN treated-RAW264.7 stimulated with E group
(10 μM) was the highest among the three groups. The number of migrated 4T1
cells of E + TSN treatment group increased 28% ± 1% compared with TSN
treatment group (P ＜ 0.05，Fig.
2C). These findings revealed that treatment of E enhanced the
vitality of cancer cells.

chamber and incubated for 18 h. The migrated cells were quantified in 10
random fields. #P ＜ 0.05.
E promoted macrophages transformed to M2 phenotype
These initial results indicated that stress hormones may be able to affect the
certain features of the macrophages. To explore the role of E in macrophage
phenotype transformation, we used flow cytometry, real-time PCR and ELISA to
detect the expression of M1 and M2 phenotype molecules. Comparing with the
control group, We found that the ratio of F4/80+/CD206+
double positive RAW 264.7 cells was strongly increased by 3.94% and 7.14% by E
treatment for 24 h and 48 h, respectively (Fig.
3A). Moreover, using real-time PCR assay, we showed that E obviously
promoted transformation from M1 (iNOS and TNFα) to M2 (IL-10 and Arg-1)
phenotype (Fig. 3B); Furthermore, we
detected CCL22 (M2 phenotype molecule) concentration in the supernatant from
different group cells. After cultured 12, 24 and 48 h, CCL22 concentration of E
+TSN treatment group cells increased by 210.3 ± 33, 294 ± 54 and 296
± 67 compared with TSN treatment group cells, respectively (P ＜
0.05, Fig. 3C). These results implied us
that E was likely to facilitate macrophages M2 polarization.

Adrenergic receptor β2 involved in the effect of E promoting macrophages
M2 polarization
Epinephrine induced its physiological effect need to activate adrenergic
receptors. So we speculated that there was adrenaline receptors expressed on the
macrophages. We examined the expression of ADR subtypes ADRα1a,
ADRα2a, ADRβ1 and ADRβ2 in primary macrophages from murine
ascites, RAW264.7 and U937 by RT-PCR and Western blotting. We found that both
the mRNA and protein expression of ADRα1a, ADRα2a and ADRβ2 were
detected, but that of ADRβ1 was impressively undetectable. After E
treatment, ADRβ2 mRNA expression was increased (Fig. 4A).

Fig. 4. ADRβ2 was selectively involved in the effect of E (10 μM)
promoting macrophages M2 polarization and then impeded breast cancer
progression. (A) ADRα1a, ADRα2a and ADRβ2 mRNA and
protein was expressed on the primary macrophages from ascites, murine
macrophages RAW 264.7 and human macrophages U937. (B) ADRβ
antagonist propranolol (10 μM) could inhibit the effect of E, but
ADRα antagonist phentolamine (1 μM) had no influence. The
antagonists were added to the medium 3 h before E treatment. (C)

significance; #P ＜ 0.05.
We next sought to which receptor subtype was involved in this process by
different inhibitors. The ADRα antagonist phentolamine (1 μM) or the
ADRβ antagonist propranolol (10 μM) was added to the medium 3 h before
E treatment and then detected the number changes of
F4/80+/CD206+ cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, ADRβ antagonist propranolol could sharply
reduce the number of M2 macrophages (10.2 ± 0.4 vs. 3.1 ± 0.4, P
＜ 0.05), while phentolamine induced slight effect (10.2 ± 0.4 vs.
9.6 ± 0.9, P ＞ 0.05). Therefore, this is a reminder that E is
functional through influencing β2 receptor activity.

To ravel out whether β2 receptor truly works，we employed two
ADRβ2 siRNAs and assessed their silence efficiency using real-time PCR.
Then, the effect of E on M2 transformation of macrophages in which ADRβ2
knockdown was measured by Flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4C, the transfection efficiency was 14% ± 0.01
and 95% ± 0.01 by ADRβ2 (1) siRNA and ADRβ2 siRNA, respectively.
We added E to RAW264.7 cells in which ADRβ2 silenced by ADRβ2 siRNA
and found that, the ratio of F4/80+/CD206+ cells probably
maintained normal ratio. The cell ratio of E + control siRNA group, E +
ADRβ2 siRNA group and control siRNA group were 9.5 ± 0.8, 3.0 ±
0.4 and 3.6 ± 0.7 (E+ control siRNA group vs.E+ADRβ2 siRNA group, P
＜ 0.05, Fig. 4C). As we all know,
M2 phenotype macrophages could promote the proliferation of tumor cells. Thus,
we investigated the influence of ADRβ2 silence of macrophages on the
proliferation ability of tumor cells. The proliferation index of 4T1 cells
treated with E and the supernatant from ADRβ2 silenced macrophages was
obviously lower than that of control siRNA group (Fig. 4D). The results further suggested that the activated
ADRβ2 expressed on macrophages could promote the progression of tumor by
accelerating macrophage M2 polarization.

Lastly, we confirmed the relationships between ADRβ2 and M2 phenotype
macrophages in human tumor tissues. ADRβ2 and the human M2 macrophages
marker CD163 were detected on tissues obtained from breast cancer patients. Our
data revealed that the ADRβ2 and CD163 positive particles co-expressed on
carcinoma tissues (Fig. 4E).
Collectively, these above results implied us that in breast cancer patients
interdicting the activity of ADRβ2 might inhibit tumor progression by
reversing M2 macrophage polarization.

DISCUSSION
Stress and its related hormones E can provide help for tumor progression (23-25). Also ADR subtypes expressed on breast cancer cells, and NE or E may
promote breast cancer proliferation and migration through activating different ADR
subtypes (26). Our studies showed that E
level in plasma increased significantly and tumor grew faster obviously after
tumor-bearing mice suffered chronic stress. These results remind us that if cancer
patients are in stress states, the deterioration and progression of tumor will be
more serious, and then the prognosis will be relatively poor.

Our important finding was that E could promote the transformation of macrophages
which stimulated with TSN to M2 phenotype and after chronic stress we detected the
up regulation of CD206 positive cells in the tumor of mice. This result demonstrated
that E could affect the malignant transformation of macrophages in TME and then
promote tumor progression. In the early 1990s, there were studies about the
sympathetic nervous system involved in the immune response, but the influence of
stress hormone on the macrophage phenotype transformation in the TME was unclear. In
2012, a group found that β1 receptor autoantibodies from peripheral blood serum
of 18 heart failure patients enhanced the TNF-α secretion in RAW 264.7 cells
in vitro, but β1 receptor agonist isoprenaline could not
induce the same effect under the same conditions in this study(19). Jiang CL. et al. reported that NE
promoted TNFα production by LPS-stimulated macrophages (20). Other studies have revealed that carvedilol, a unique
vasodilating β-adrenergic antagonist, and endogenous adrenergic agonists
(adrenalin and noradrenalin) inhibited NO production and iNOS protein expression in
LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (18). A new
study suggested that E could induce M2 polarization through ADRβ2 then exert
anti-inflammatory effect during endotoxemia and acute lung injury (27). In this study after TSN stimulation and
E treatment, the expression of TNF-α and iNOS were obviously reduced in RAW
264.7 cells in TME. These studies indicated that adrenergic system did have an
impact on the function of macrophages, but the results might not completely be the
same under different conditions. Theoretically, macrophages could differentiate to
M1 after LPS stimulation (28) and to M2
after TSN stimulation (21), so we speculated
that the influence of stress-related hormones on iNOS and TNFα expression in
macrophages would be different under different stimulating conditions.

We used specific blockers and siRNA to inhibit the function of receptors and found
that stress hormones affecting on the transformation of macrophages to M2 mainly or
at least in part induced by β2 receptor. Zinyama R. B. found that E inhibited
macrophage NO production through ADRβ (29) and ADRβ2 stimulation could inhibited NO generations by
mycobacterium avium infected macrophages (30). These results were consistent with our studies. Another discovery
of our study was that after chronic stress we detected the M2 type TAM significantly
increased in mice tumors in vivo experiments. This was indeed the
first time to confirm the influence of stress on macrophage phenotype transformation
in TME on animal model, and this results proved our hypothesis. We further tested
human breast cancer tissues and found that the expression of ADRβ2 receptor and
type M2 macrophages (CD206+) obviously increased in cancer tissue compared with
para-carcinoma tissue, and they were positively correlated with each other. These
results showed that stress could increase the transformation of macrophages to M2 by
activating adrenaline receptors in TME, and then promote cancer progression.

In conclusion, our study found E could promote the transformation of macrophages from
M1 to M2 and promote the progress of cancer by influencing the TME. This effect was
mediated by β2 receptor. Negative stress is the ‘most popular’ kind
of stress. It’s a stress that causes negative implication such as anxiety,
fatigue and illness. Considering the published reports, our study suggested that
negative stress may not only influence the cancer progress directly (31), but also influence the TME including
macrophages. These dual functions would result in poor prognosis of the cancer
patients. In future, we will keep on studying the downstream signal pathways of ADRs
and completely elucidate the underlying mechanisms of stress affecting the
macrophages transformation in TME. No doubt, the molecular level research further
analyzed the potential role of stress in tumorigenesis and progression. It would
provide a more profound reference for antitumor drug screening from the angle of
antianxiety, antidepressant or antianxiety-associated hormones.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal models
Female Balb/c mice, 6 to 8 week-old, were purchased from Vital River Lab Animal
Technology Co., Ltd. All experimental procedures were approved by the Medical
Ethics Committee, Nankai University. After inoculating subcutaneously to the
left breast gland of the mice with 1*105 4T1 cells, the animals
(Female Balb/c mice, 6 to 8 week-old,) were divided randomly to two groups:
control group and chronic stress group. In control group, 5 mice were group
housed in one cage. While the mice in chronic stress group were implemented with
social isolation stress referred to Anil K Sood (23), and in this group one mouse was individually housed in one
cage, and there was a wall and at least a 24-inch distance between cages. The
mice were sacrificed by dislocation on 21st day and 0.5 ml blood was
drawn from the heart. And then the tumor was weight, measured and frozen at
−70℃.

Cell culture
Murine breast cancer cell lines 4T1, murine macrophages RAW 264.7 and human
macrophages U937 were purchased from ATCC. Primary Mϕs were obtained from
ascites of BALB/c mice. The cell culture has been described by QS Wang (19). Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were
co-cultured with the medium containing 40% TSN (RPMI 1640: TSN=1.5:1) to mimic
the TME in vitro.

Measurement of total E and CCL22 secretion
The concentration of E in mice serum and CCL22 in the supernatants from the cells
was measured through a mouse E (Bogoo Biotechnology, China) and CCL22-specific
(R&D Systems) ELISA kit. The results are from three independent experiments
performed in triplicate.

Wound closure assay
Monolayer 4T1 cell were scraped using 10 μl pipette tips. Incubating with
the supernatants collected from TSN co-cultured RAW 264.7 cell in the presence
or absence of E for 18 h. Photographs were taken and analyzed using Image J
software to measure the wound closure area.

Transwell migration assay
4T1 migration ability was detected in Transwell chambers (Corning) with 8.0
μm pore size polycarbonate membrane. 1×105 4T1cell were
resuspended in 300 μl RPMI 1640 with 2%FBS and seeded in the upper chamber.
The lower chamber was added with the supernatant from RAW 264.7 cells, or TSN
treated RAW 264.7 with E or not which incubated in RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS. After
18 h of incubation, the undersurface cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and stained with 0.1% crystal violet.

Flow cytometry
1×105 RAW 264.7cells treated with TSN in the absence or presence
of E (10 μM) were trypsinized and stained with FITC conjugated anti-mouse
F4/80 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and PE conjugated CD206 (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed on BD FACS Canto II. In the experiments with ADR inhibitors, the
ADRα inhibitor phentolamine (1 μM) and the ADRβ inhibitor
propranolol (10 μM) was added 3 h before E treatment.

siRNA
Control siRNA, ADRβ2 siRNA (target sequence
5’-CAGAGTGGATATCACGTGGAA-3’) and ADRβ2 (1) siRNA (target sequence
5’-CCGATAGCAGGTGAACTCGAA-3’) (QIAGEN) were transfected into RAW
264.7 with lipofectamine 2000.

RT-PCR and Real-time PCR
RT-PCR was used to detect the expression of ADRs subtypes including ADRα1a,
ADRα2a, ADRβ1 and ADRβ2. Real-time PCR with CFX96
TouchTM (Bio-rad) was performed to semiquantify IL-10, Arg-1,
TNFα, iNOS and ADRβ2. Briefly, total cellular RNA (1 μg) was
isolated from cultured cells and reverse-transcribed using oligo (dT) and M-MLV
reverse transcriptase (Promega). Then real-time PCR amplifications were done
with SyberGreen Mix (ABI). Gene expression was derived according to the
equation2^ -ddCt.

Immunoblotting
Rabbit anti-ADRα1a, ADRα2a, ADRβ1, ADRβ2 (1:800) and
anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Abcam. Finally, labeled proteins
were revealed by ECL plus (Merck Millipore).

Cell proliferation
1×105 4T1 cells incubated with the supernatant RAW 264.7 cells
transfected with control siRNA or ADRβ2 siRNA in the presence of E. After
adding CCK-8, the absorbance was read 450 nm.

Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence analyses
For immunohistochemistry, the tumor tissue paraffin specimen from tumor bearing
mice was stained with anti-CD206 Ab, and immunoactivity was detected with
diaminobenzidine (DAB). Samples of breast cancers were obtained from Tianjin
Cancer Hospital with local ethical guidelines. 4-μm paraffin sections were
processed for immunofluorescence analysis with anti-ADRβ2 and CD163
monoclonal Ab (Abcam). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubating with
TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. The
nuclear stained with DAPI. Images were assessed with a confocal microscope
(Olympus, FV1000).

Statistics
Data were presented as means ± sem. Statistical differences were determined
by ANOVA or Student’s t test by Sigmastat3.5 software. Significance was
accepted at P values ＜ 0.05.
