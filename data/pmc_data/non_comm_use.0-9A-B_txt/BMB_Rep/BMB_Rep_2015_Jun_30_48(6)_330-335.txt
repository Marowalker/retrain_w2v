metastasis-regulating gene in cervical cancer cells. However, the precise
mechanism of action for API5 is poorly understood. Here, we show that API5
increases the metastatic capacity of cervical cancer cells in
vitro and in vivo via up-regulation of MMP-9.
Interestingly, API5-mediated metastasis was strongly dependent on the Erk
signaling pathway. Conversely, knock-down of API5 via siRNA technology decreased
the level of phospho-Erk, the activity of the MMPs, in vitro
invasion, and in vivo pulmonary metastasis. Moreover, the
Erk-mediated metastatic action was abolished by the mutation of leucine into
arginine within the heptad leucine repeat region, which affects protein-protein
interactions. Thus, API5 increases the metastatic capacity of tumor cells by
up-regulating MMP levels via activation of the Erk signaling pathway. [BMB

==== Body
INTRODUCTION
API5, also called AAC-11 (anti-apoptosis clone 11) and FIF (fibroblast growth factor
2-interacting factor), is a well-known nuclear protein whose expression prevents
apoptosis due to the deprivation of serum and growth factors (1). Up-regulation of API5 has been associated with poor
survival of patients with NSCLC (2). A
recent study indicated that the antiapoptotic function of API5 might be mediated by
suppression of the apoptosis induced by the transcription factor E2F1 (3) and it also contributes to the activity of
E2F1, which in turn contributes to the G1/S phase cell cycle transition (4). Pim-2 activates API5 to inhibit the
apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via the NF-kB pathway (5). The anti-apoptotic function of API5 is
accomplished by interaction with various binding partners such as fibroblast growth
factor 2 (FGF-2) (6), Acinus, and ALC1.

Although the role of API5 has been revealed (7, 8), the molecular mechanism
of API5 for regulating metastasis in cervical cancer is not yet well characterized.
In this study, we demonstrated that API5 modulated metastasis of cervical cancer in
an Erk-dependent manner. API5 consistently enhanced MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretion
through the transcription factor, AP-1. Furthermore, after mutation of leucine
residues in its heptad leucine repeat region, API5 could no longer enhance
metastasis through the Erk signaling cascade, suggesting that the ability to mediate
protein-protein interactions is one of the important functions of API5 for
regulating metastasis in cervical cancer. Thus, this study demonstrates that API5
promotes the metastatic capacity of tumor cells by up-regulating MMP levels via Erk
signaling.

RESULTS
API5 overexpression increases the in vivo and
in vitro invasive potential of human
cervical cancer cells.
To investigate whether API5 expression is associated with metastasis in cervical
cancer, we transduced the API5 gene into API5low CaSki cells and
confirmed the expression level by western blotting (Fig. 1A). We observed a statistically significant increase
in the invasive activity of API5-overexpressing cells compared to control cells
(Fig. 1B). To further characterize
the in vivo metastasis-promoting ability of API5, CaSki/no
insert or CaSki/API5 cells were injected into nude mice, and the mice were
examined for the formation of pulmonary metastatic nodules. Intravenous
transplantation of CaSki/API5 cells resulted in significantly more visible
metastatic nodules in the lungs compared to the visible nodules after
intravenous transplantation of CaSki/no insert cells (Fig. 1C). We also confirmed the expression of high levels
of API5 in siAPI5 transfected HeLa cells (Fig.
1D) reduced cell invasion in vitro
(Fig. 1E) and in tumor nodules
in vivo (Fig. 1F).
Both the in vitro invasion assay and the
in vivo assay in nude mice suggest that API5 has the
potential to promote metastasis of human cervical cancer cells.

MMP-9 is involved in invasion of CaSki/API5 cells
To further elucidate the molecular mechanism of API5 for enhancing metastasis, we
examined the expression levels and activity of MMP2 and MMP9 (gelatinases A and
B, respectively), which play essential roles in the degradation of the
extracellular matrix during metastasis. Supernatants of CaSki cells expressing
API5 or no insert were collected and used for gelatin zymography analysis.
CaSki/no insert and CaSki/API5 cells secreted the pro-form of both MMP-2 and
MMP-9, but only MMP-9 was upregulated by API5 overexpression (Fig. 2A). For further confirmation of the
role of MMP9 in API5-mediated invasion, we performed an invasion assay after
treatment of CaSki/API5 cells with MMP2 or MMP9 siRNA (siMMP2 or siMMP9,
respectively). The suppression of MMP9 by siRNA significantly inhibited the
invasive activity of CaSki/API5 cells compared to that of MMP2 siRNA-transfected
CaSki/API5 cells (Fig. 2B). This result
suggests that MMP9 activity is required for the increased invasive capacity
resulting from ectopic API5 expression. To determine whether API5 regulates MMP9
at the transcriptional level, we performed a reporter assay using a construct
containing a luciferase gene driven by a MMP9 promoter. Transfection of the MMP9
reporter construct and the API5 gene into CaSki cells resulted in a significant
dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2C). This result suggests that MMP9 level is increased by API5
to promote the invasive activity of tumor cells.

MEK/Erk signaling pathway is involved in API5-induced MMP-9 activity
We performed western blot analysis to determine the expression of various
signaling molecules that may play a role in the global control of metastasis. As
shown in Fig. 3A, greater activation of
Erk 1 (p-Erk) was observed in CaSki/API5 cells than in CaSki/no insert cells,
while the phosphorylation of AKT and p38 were not altered. Based on this
finding, we tried to determine whether Erk is a critical factor for API5-induced
MMP-9 expression. After treatment with PD98059, which selectively blocks the
activity of MEK1, the activation of MMP-9 was significantly down-regulated in
CaSki/API5 cells (Fig. 3B). PD98059 could
also inhibit the invasive ability of CaSki/API5 cells. To avoid the
non-biological function of these pharmacological inhibitors, we examined the
inhibition of the invasion activity of CaSki/API5 cells using p42 (Erk 2)
specific siRNA (sip42). We transfected sip42 into CaSki/API5 cells and then
examined the expression of p42 in CaSki/API5 cells by western blotting (Fig. 3C). The number of invading
sip42-transfected CaSki/API5 cells was significantly decreased compared to the
invading siGFP-transfected cells (Fig.
3D). To further confirm the dramatic decrease in the invasive potential
of sip42-transfected CaSki/API5 cells in vivo, nude mice were
injected with either siGFP- or sip42-transfected CaSki/API5 cells, and the mice
were examined for the formation of pulmonary metastatic nodules. After
intravenous transplantation of p42 siRNA-transfected CaSki/API5 cells, there was
a significant decrease in the number of visible metastatic nodules in the lung
compared to that observed after intravenous transplantation of siGFP-transfected
CaSki/API5 cells (Fig. 3E). These results
suggest that API5 positively induces the transcriptional activation of MMP-9
expression via the Erk signaling pathway.

API5 regulates MMP-9 expression through the transcription factor,
AP-1
The AP-1 and NF-kB elements of the MMP-9 promoter are essential for the induction
of MMP-9 expression. To identify the cis-element responsible for the response to
API5, we examined the promoter activity of MMP-9 by using a serial deletion
construct of the MMP-9 promoter. A genomic fragment containing 710 bp from the
5'-promoter region of the MMP-9 gene, which includes the putative TATA box, two
AP-1 sites, and a NF-kB site, as well as an AP-1 deletion mutant was subcloned
into the pGL2-basic vector (WT-MMP9pro, Mut-AP-1-1, and MutAP-1-2). These
plasmids were co-transfected with API5 into CaSki cells. Luciferase activity was
barely observed when the pGL2-basic was co-transfected with API5 vector into
CaSki cells (Fig. 4A). The luciferase
activity of WT-MMP9pro, which was co-transfected with an API5 vector, was higher
than that of the pGL2-basic vector. On the other hand, API5-driven luciferase
activity was reduced in the AP-1-1 and AP-1-2 mutants of the MMP-9 promoter,
indicating that AP-1 binding sites are indispensable for the induction of MMP-9
expression by API5 in CaSki cells. This result indicates that API5-mediated
MMP-9 expression critically depends on intact AP-1 binding sites within the
MMP-9 promoter region. Furthermore, we determined whether API5 regulates
transcriptional levels of the transcription factor AP-1 in cervical cancer cells
via the Erk signaling cascade. As shown in Fig.
4B, the luciferase activity of AP-1 in API5 transfected cells was
higher than in control cells. However, the luciferase activity of AP-1 was
reduced in DNErk-transfected cells. This result indicates that API5 induced the
activation of Erk, which in turn induced the activity of AP-1, thereby
regulating MMP-9 expression through the transcriptional factor AP-1.

Heptad leucine repeat region of API5 might be important for activation of the
Erk-MMP9 axis
The heptad leucine repeat region of API5 might affect protein-protein
interactions between API5 and other API5-interacting partners, such as Acinus
(10, 11). We therefore considered the possibility that mutation
of leucine residues (Leu-384 and Leu-391) in the heptad leucine repeat region
could affect Erk-mediated MMP-9 expression induced by API5. To address this
question, we generated an API5 LL/RR mutant (LL/RR) and transduced it into CaSki
cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, API5 LL/RR
transduced cells did not display Erk activation, unlike wild type (wt) API5
transduced cells. This result indicated that the heptad leucine repeating region
of API5 may be important for Erk activation in cervical cancer cells.
Furthermore, we analyzed MMP9 promoter activity using gelatin zymography in the
API5 LL/RR-transduced cells. As shown in Fig.
4D and E, the activity and expression of MMP-9 were lower in the API5
LL/RR-transfected cells compared to the wtAPI5-transfected cells. We further
performed an invasion assay, which showed that the LL/RR mutant transfected
cells exhibited decreased invasion compared to API5 transfected cells (Fig. 4F). These results indicate that the
heptad leucine repeat region of API5 may be required for Erk-mediated MMP-9
expression. To confirm the decrease in the invasive potential of the LL/RR
mutant transfected cells in vivo, nude mice were injected with
API5 transfected cells and the mice were examined for the formation of pulmonary
metastatic nodules. Inoculation with API5 LL/RR-transfected cells caused a
significant decrease in visible metastatic nodules in the lungs compared to
inoculation with wtAPI5 transfected cells (Fig.
4G). Our data suggest that interactions between API5 and its binding
partners through the heptad leucine repeat region of API5 can affect the
metastasis of cervical cancer cells via Erk-induced MMP9 expression.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that API5 mediates the activation of the Erk cascade,
which leads to the induction of AP-1. The promoter region of the MMP-9 gene contains
binding sites for AP-1 and NF-kB in MMP-9 gene activation, and the important roles
of AP-1 and NF-kB have been reported (12,
13). MAPK activation can lead to MMP-9
induction through the regulation of an essential transcription factor such as c-fos
(14). Expression of this immediate early
gene depends on MAPK activation; further phosphorylation of c-fos by MAPK enhances
MMP-9 expression. Thus, initial activation may serve to enhance c-fos
transcriptional activity and AP-1-dependent ex- pression of the MMP-9 gene. Based on
this observation, activation of Erk is relayed through a well characterized
signaling pathway involving transactivation and DNA binding of the AP-1 complex.
Therefore, we hypothesized that an API5 signaling cascade during Erk activation may
induce MMP-9 expression through the activation of AP-1. In this study, we
demonstrated that API5-induced MMP-9 expression is critically dependent on an intact
AP-1 binding site within the MMP-9 promoter region. AP-1 binding site mutation could
affect MMP-9 expression in API5 transfected cells. This result may support our
hypothesis that API5 regulates MMP9 expression via Erk-dependent AP-1
activation.

API5 has the ability to form a protein complex with binding partners such as FGF2 and
Acinus, and it prevents drug-induced apoptotic cell death through physiological
binding because API5 possesses HEAT and ARM-like repeats, which are a kind of
protein-protein interaction modules. In the present study, API5 LL/RR failed to
increase the invasive potential caused by the activation of the Erk-MMP9 axis (11). The interaction between API5 and its
binding partners through the heptad leucine repeat region of API5 may therefore
regulate Erk activity, and subsequently contribute to the invasion-promoting ability
of API5. Further studies are needed to identify the API5 binding partner and explain
the regulatory mechanism of Erk activation induced by API5.

In conclusion, API5 induces the Erk pathway, and in turn, the activation of the Erk
pathway leads to the activation of the transcription factor AP-1 and finally to an
increase in MMP-9 expression. Based on these data, we propose that API5 plays a role
in the induction of MMP-9 via activation of the Erk signaling pathway.

Mice
Six- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice and nude mice were purchased from
DaehanBiolink (Chungbuk, Korea). All animal procedures were performed in
accordance with the recommendations for the proper use and care of laboratory
animals.

in vitro invasion assay
The invasion ability of tumor cells was examined using 24-well culture
insert-based assays (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The culture insert,
with an 8 μm pore size, was precoated to a density of 2-3 mg/ml insert of
20 μl Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences). Cells were
suspended in serum free medium, and 1 x 105 cells were added onto the
insert. After incubating for 24 hours at 37℃, the cells that invaded or
migrated through the Fluoro-Blok membrane were stained with crystal-violet, and
images of the stained cells were taken. The invasive cells were then counted
using a q20X objective microscope. The samples were plated in triplicate or
quadruplicate, and the experiment was repeated at least three times.

Pulmonary metastasis assay
Female BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice (5-week-old) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratory (Japan), and housed under pathogen-free conditions. All animal
procedures were performed according to approved protocols and in accordance with
recommendations for the proper use and care of laboratory animals. Mice were
injected with 1x106 cells in 0.1 ml Opti-MEM through the tail vein.
The overall health and total body weight of the mice were then monitored. At 4
weeks after injection, the mice were sacrificed. The lung tissues were observed
with the naked eye and the number of visible tumors on the lung surface was
counted. Each experimental group included 6 to 10 mice.

Statistical analysis
All data are representative of at least three separate experiments. The data from
in vivo lung metastasis experiments were evaluated by
ANOVA. Comparisons between individual data points were made using
Student’s t-test. All P-values ＜ 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
