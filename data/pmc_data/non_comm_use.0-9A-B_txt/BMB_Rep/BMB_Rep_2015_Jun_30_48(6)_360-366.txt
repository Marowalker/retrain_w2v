highest rate of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. WNT signaling is
initiated by binding of WNT to various receptors, including frizzleds (FZDs),
and plays a critical role in CRC and other tumor development by regulating
proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and polarity. Among the
members of the FZD family, FZD6 is broadly expressed in various tissues, and its
overexpression has been reported in several cancers, suggesting an important
role in cancer development. In this study, we investigated the expression of
FZD6 in patients with CRC and found it to be increased in tumors, as compared to
paired adjacent non-tumor tissues. Additionally, we found that FZD6 expression
was negatively regulated by miR199a5p in CRC cells. These results suggest that
overexpression of FZD6, mediated by reduced expression of miR-199a-5p, may play
an important role in the development of CRC. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(6):

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC), the third most common cancer worldwide, has the highest rate
of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. There are more than 1 million cases of
CRC diagnosed each year, as well as 600,000 CRC-related deaths (1). Although previous studies have characterized numerous
molecules as risk factors in the oncogenesis and development of CRC, the molecular
pathogenesis of CRC has yet to be fully established. Thus, many studies are
currently being conducted to identify CRC-specific carcinogenesis-associated
molecules, as well as to develop effective prognostic and treatment strategies.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small RNA molecules that consist of 2022
nucleotides. miRNAs regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by
binding to the 3’-UTR of specific target mRNAs (2). Aberrant miRNA expression has been associated with tumor
initiation and progression. Recently, dysregulation of miRNAs and their target genes
have been established in CRC (3).

The WNT/frizzled (FZD) signaling pathways can be further distinguished into canonical
and non-canonical pathways (4). Nineteen
members of the WNT family can bind to ten members of the FZD family, thereby
activating various downstream pathways, such as the WNT/β-catenin (canonical),
WNT/planar cell polarity, and WNT/Ca2+(non-canonical) pathways (4-6).
Aberrant constitutive activation of the WNT/FZD pathway and subsequent uncontrolled
activation of these processes in normal cells has been implicated as one of the main
causes of cancer development (7).

The FZD6 gene localized on human chromosome 8q22.3-q23.1 is broadly
expressed in various tissues, including the heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver,
skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, thymus, prostate, testis, ovary, small intestine,
and colon (8). Furthermore, increased
expression of FZD6 reported in several cancers suggests that FZD6 may play an
important role in cancer development (9-11).

Although members of the FZD family have been widely studied with regard to their
roles and underlying molecular mechanisms in the development of CRC, the role of
FZD6 in CRC has not been characterized (12-14). In the present study,
we investigated the expression of FZD6 in CRC patients and found it to be increased
in tumors, compared with paired adjacent nontumor tissues. Moreover, FZD6 expression
was negatively regulated by miR-199a-5p in CRC cells. These results suggested that
the overexpression of FZD6, mediated by reduced expression of miR-199a-5p, in CRC
may play an important role in the development of CRC.

RESULTS
FZD6 expression is increased in CRC patients
To examine whether the expression levels of FZD6 were changed in CRC, we first
used the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession numbers: GSE37364 and
GSE21510). We found that FZD6 expression was significantly upregulated in both
CRC cohorts (Fig. 1A, B). To determine
the expression levels of FZD6 in CRC, we performed a quantitative reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in eight pairs of CRC samples
and adjacent non-tumor samples. Consistent with the GEO data, the expression
levels of FZD6 were found to be increased significantly in the CRC samples,
compared with those in the matching non-tumor tissues (Fig. 1C). To further investigate the increased expression
of FZD6 in CRC tissues, we performed immunohistochemical staining for FZD6, and
detected that FZD6 protein expression was highly increased in CRC samples,
compared with matching non-tumor samples (Fig.
1D and E). These results indicated that upregulation of FZD6
correlated with the development of CRC.

Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession numbers, GSE37364 and

immunohistochemistry in CRC patients compared to matching non-tumor

WNT4 expression is not changed in patients with CRC
"WNT4, a member of the Wnt family, is a ligand for FZD6 that has been shown to
interact with the cysteine-rich domain of FZD6 in kidney epithelial cells (15). Additionally, WNT4 has been
implicated in leukemia oncogenesis by regulating cell growth (16). Because concurrent upregulation of
ligands and receptors has been shown in other cancers (17, 18), we
tested whether FZD6 overexpression occurred concurrently with WNT4 expression to
activate WNT4/FZD6 signaling in CRC. To explore whether WNT4 expression was also
increased in CRC patients, we analyzed GEO data, as well as CRC tissues. In
contrast to FZD6 expression, WNT4 expression was not significantly changed
between CRC and nontumor samples according to the GEO data (Fig. 2A, B). QRT-PCR analyses also showed no difference in
WNT4 mRNA levels between CRC and matching adjacent
non-tumor tissues (Fig. 2C). Thus, WNT4
expression was not consistently changed in CRC tissues, compared with non-tumor
tissues, suggesting that WNT4 itself was not directly involved in CRC
development."

the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession numbers, GSE37364
and GSE21510) indicated that WNT4 expression showed no significant
difference between CRC patients and control groups. P values were
calculated using the by MannWhitney test. NS = not significant. (C)

tissues had no consistent expression pattern of WNT4 versus the control
groups. Data were normalized against GAPDH mRNA expression.
FZD6 is a target of miR-199a-5p in CRC
Because WNT4 expression did not correlate with Fzd6 expression and CRC
development, we explored an additional mechanism for the regulation of FZD6
expression. Recent studies have indicated that the expression levels of several
FZDs were regulated by specific microRNAs (miRNAs), and associated with the
development of various types of cancers (10, 19-22). Moreover, FZD6 expression was also
reported to be inhibited by miR-194 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (10). Thus, we investigated whether the
overexpression of FZD6 in CRC was caused by downregulation of a specific miRNAs.
We searched for miRNAs that targeted the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of Fzd6
mRNA and regulated its expression using computer-based algorithms such as
miRBase Targets, TargetScan (release 5.2), and Microrna.org databases. Among the
candidates, we selected miR-199a-5p as a putative regulator of FZD6 expression,
based on the results of a recent study that showed a reduced expression of
miR-199a-5p expression in CRC patients, compared with normal individuals (23). As shown in Fig. 3A, the FZD6 3’-UTR contains a
putative binding sequence for miR-199a-5p that is evolutionarily conserved among
various species. We thus considered that a loss or a reduction of miR-199a-5p
expression may have resulted in upregulated expression of FZD6 in CRC, and that
this regulation may be associated with CRC development.

Fig. 3. FZD6 is a direct target of miR-199a-5p in CRC cells. (A) The putative
binding sequence of miR-199a-5p in FZD6 3’-UTR is well conserved
in various species (upper panel). Diagram shows the miR-199a-5p and a

Target scan algorithm (bottom panel). (B) qRT-PCR showed that endogenous
expression of FZD6 mRNA in DLD1 cells was significantly downregulated by
overexpression of miR-199a-5p. Data were normalized against GAPDH mRNA
expression. Results are the average of three independent experiments
conducted in duplicate. **P ＜ 0.01 (C) Western blot also revealed
that overexpression of miR-199a-5p resulted in reduced expression of
FZD6 at protein level. (D) Luciferase activity was significantly
decreased in miR-199a-5p overexpressed DLD1 cells. Results are the
average of three independent experiments conducted in duplicate. ***P
＜ 0.001.
To determine whether miR-199a-5p inhibited the endogenous expression of FZD6 in
CRC cells, relative expression levels of Fzd6 mRNA were assessed in DLD1 cells
transfected with a miR-199a-5p mimic. QRT-PCR analysis showed that FZD6 mRNA
expression was significantly downregulated in the miR-199a-5p mimic-treated DLD1
cells, compared with control transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Compared with the negative mimic-transfected cells,
decreased FZD6 protein levels were also detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3C). To determine whether FZD6
expression was regulated directly by miR-199a-5p, we performed a luciferase
reporter assay in DLD1 cells co-transfected with luciferase gene constructs
containing either the full-length 3’-UTR of FZD6, a negative
control mimic, or a miR-199a-5p mimic. This results showed significantly
inhibited luciferase activity in the cell lysates transfected with miR-199a-5p,
compared with those transfected with the negative control mimic (Fig. 3D). Additionally, we further
investigated whether other CRC cell lines also showed similar regulation of FZD
expression by miR-199a-5p. Using qRT-PCR, FZD6 mRNA expression
levels were determined in five CRC cell lines (HT29, SNU-C2B, SNU-C4, SNU-C5,
Colo320DM) transfected with a miR-199a-5p mimic. As expected, the expression of
FZD6 was significantly reduced in all five cell lines transfected with a
miR-199a-5p mimic, compared with those transfected with a negative control mimic
(Fig. 4A). Additionally, we found
that miR-199a expression was frequently decreased in CRC tissues, as assessed in
CRC tumors and matching adjacent non-tumors from eight patients (Fig. 4B). As expected, this downregulation
pattern was inversely related to the level of FZD6 expression (Fig. 1C). These observations suggest that
miR-199a-5p targeted the 3’-UTR of FZD6 mRNA directly,
resulting in inhibition of its expression in CRC.

independent experiments conducted in duplicate. *P ＜ 0.05, **P

DISCUSSION
Recently, the results of multiple studies have shown that the expression levels of
several members of the FZD family, acting in both canonical and non-canonical Wnt
pathways, were upregulated in various cancers. For example, FZD1 was shown to be
upregulated in colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer (24-26).
Overexpression of FZD3 has been detected in lung can- cer, leukemia, and myeloma
(27, 28). FZD7 expression has also been shown to be increased in gastric,
esophageal, and colon cancers, as well as in HCC (14, 29-31). FZD10 is also highly expressed in colon and lung cancers
(13, 32). The results from these reports suggest that the abnormal expression
of FZDs induced aberrant activation of the WNT signaling pathway, which may underlie
their roles in cancer development.

In the present study, we examined the expression of FZD6 mRNA and protein in patients
with CRC and found it to be upregulated in tumors, compared with non-tumor tissues.
The expression of FZDs is required for the activation of genes associated with the
non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Similar to the canonical Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway, aberrant activation of non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway has
also been shown to directly promote the invasiveness and malignant progression of
various types of cancers (7). A previous
study demonstrated that the FZD6 expression level was increased in squamous cell
carcinoma, compared with site-matched normal skin (9). Its expression was also increased in primary HCC (10). Moreover, the results of a recent study
revealed that high expression levels of FZD6 correlated significantly with poor
survival in human neuroblastoma (11). Based
on these results, as well as the results of the current study, it seems reasonable
to suggest that FZD6 is involved in WNT-mediated signaling in CRC development.

In the present study, we found that miR-199a-5p inhibited FZD6 expression directly in
various CRC cell lines by targeting the 3’-UTR of its mRNA. miR-199a-5p plays an
important role in tumor development through the regulation of the expression of
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in various cancers, including ovarian,
hepatocellular, gastric, and small cell carcinoma of the cervix (33-38). Recently, Hu and colleagues demonstrated that miR-199a-5p was
significantly downregulated in CRC tissues and cells (23). Additionally, they found that upregulated miR-199a-5p
suppressed DDR1 expression and resulted in decreased migration and invasion of CRC
cells, compared with controls. These findings are comparable to the results of the
current study, which demonstrated the downregulation of miR-199a-5p in CRC patients
and the inverse correlation of its expression with FZD6 expression. Moreover, the
results of several studies have shown that non-canonical WNT signaling controls and
regulates tumor development by influencing levels of migration-associated proteins,
including cytoskeletal proteins and integrin (4, 39). Although further
studies are required to determine the precise role(s) of FZD6, current knowledge
suggests that miR-199a-5p acts as a tumor suppressor via inhibition of DDR1 and FZD6
expression, resulting in reduced invasiveness. Additionally, downregulation of
miR-199a-5p and overexpression of FZD6 have been reported in HCC tissues in two
different studies (10, 35). Considering the inverse relationship between miR-199a-5p
and FZD6 expression, the regulation of FZD6 by miR-199a-5p may also occur in HCC.
Because there are several oncogenes known to be targets of miR-199a-5p in other
cancers, further studies are required to fully determine the relationship between
these target genes and miR-199a-5p in patients with CRC.

In conclusion, data from the current study indicated that FZD6 expression was
increased and regulated by miR-199a-5p in CRC tissues and cells. These results
provide evidence of a new role for FZD6 and miR-199a-5p in CRC, which may help in
developing potential target-based therapies for patients with CRC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue samples
All CRC and non-tumor colorectal tissue samples were obtained from the Department
of Pathology in the College of Medicine at the Catholic University of Korea. All
samples were approved for analysis by the Institutional Review of Board of the
College of Medicine at the Catholic University of Korea.

Cell culture and transfection experiments
All colorectal cancer cells (DLD-1, HT29, ANU-C2B, SNU-C4, SNU-C5, Colo320 DM)
were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank and maintained in RPMI-1640 Medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum with 5% CO2 in a
37℃ incubator. miR199a5p mimics and negative mimics were purchased from
Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with a miR-199a-5p mimic using the DharmaFECT
1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The negative mimic was used for control purposes. After 72 h of
incubation, cells were harvested and used for extraction of total RNA or
protein.

miR-199a-5p target gene prediction
To predict miR-199a-5p target genes, the miRBase
(http://www.mirbase.org/), TargetScan version 5.2
(http://www.targetscan.org/), and microRNA.org
(http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do/) databases were
used.

miRNA-specific qRT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the QIAzol reagent (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized
using the Mir-X miRNA First-strand synthesis kit (Clontech) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. The following primers were used to amplify
miR-199a and U6, respectively: 5’CCAGTGTTCAGACTACCTGTTC3’ and
5’TGGCCCCTGCGCAAGGATG3’. The relative expression of miR-199a-5p was
determined against the expression of U6 small nuclear RNA using the comparative
ΔΔCt method (40).

RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
Total RNAs were isolated from cells using the QIAzol reagent (Qiagen) and
reverse-transcribed into cDNA using a PrimeScript 1st strand cDNA
Synthesis kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RT-PCR
and qRT-PCR were performed using a Thermal Cycler-100 (MJ Research) and a CFX96
(Bio-Rad Laboratories), respectively. The primer sequences and cycling
conditions used are listed in Supplement Table 1. All expression levels were
normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase gene expression using
the comparative ΔΔCt method. Results represent the average of three
independent experiments measured in duplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested from plates 72 h post-transfection. Protein extracts were
prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0) according to a standard method. Cell lysates were subjected to 10% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane (41). The
membrane was then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal FZD6 antibody (1:2,500,
Abcam) or a mouse polyclonal β-actin antibody (1:5,000, Santa Cruz)
following a standard protocol. Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Amersham Bioscience).

Plasmid Construction
The full length 3’-UTR cDNA of FZD6 was amplified from
cDNAs generated from the total RNAs of DLD1 cells by PCR using PrimeSTAR DNA
Polymerase (Takara) prior to cloning into pGEMT-easy vectors and subcloning into
psiCHECK-2 vector DNA using the Not I cloning sites (Promega). The gene-
specific primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1.

Luciferase reporter assay
DLD1 cells (5×105/dish) were seeded in 60 mm dishes at 70%
confluency. After 24 h, cells were co-transfected with 50 nM miR-199a-5p mimic
and 1 μg of a reporter construct containing the 3’-UTR of
FZD6 using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Luciferase
activity was determined after 48 h post- transfection using the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay reagent (Promega) (42).

Immunohistochemistry
CRC paraffin sections were obtained from the Department of Pathology in the
College of Medicine at the Catholic University of Korea. Immunohistochemistry
was performed as described previously (43). Briefly, CRC paraffin wax sections were fixed prior to antigen
retrieval. Slides were then incubated with the antibody against FZD6 (1:100,
Santa Cruz) overnight at room temperature. Signal detection was achieved using a
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) incubated
for 1 h at room temperature. The 3,3’-diaminobenzidine chromogen was used
for the color reaction (Dako) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Statistical analysis
P values were determined using Student’s t-tests. A value of P ＜
0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.
