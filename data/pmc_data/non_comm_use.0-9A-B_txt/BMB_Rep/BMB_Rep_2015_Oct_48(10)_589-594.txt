(sog) gene directs its sequential expression in the
neurogenic ectoderm and the ventral midline of the developing
Drosophila embryo. Here, we characterize three unusual
features of the shadow enhancer midline activity. First, the minimal regions for
the two different enhancer activities exhibit high overlap within the shadow
enhancer, meaning that one developmental enhancer possesses dual enhancer
activities. Second, the midline enhancer activity relies on five Single-minded
(Sim)-binding sites, two of which have not been found in any Sim target
enhancers. Finally, two linked Dorsal (Dl)- and Zelda (Zld)-binding sites,
critical for the neurogenic ectoderm enhancer activity, are also required for
the midline enhancer activity. These results suggest that early activation by Dl
and Zld may facilitate late activation via the noncanonical sites occupied by
Sim. We discuss a model for Zld as a pioneer factor and speculate its role in
midline enhancer activity. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(10): 589-594]

INTRODUCTION
Most transcriptional enhancers tested to date only regulate the expression of their
target genes at a particular time and in a defined space (1). Thus, many developmental genes that are used repeatedly
at different times and at diverse locations during development need various
enhancers by which their differential expression is controlled both temporally and
spatially (2). For instance,
rhomboid (rho), a dorsal-ventral (DV)
patterning gene, is expressed in the presumptive neurogenic ectoderm (NE) and the
ventral midline (VM) of the developing Drosophila embryo (3, 4). The sequential expression in these two different spaces is controlled by
two different enhancers (5). Although these
enhancers are adjacent to one another, they are functionally autonomous and
geographically separable.

In contrast with previous observations, however, recent transgenic studies have shown
that the short gastrulation (sog) locus contains
two separate enhancers by which its expression in the NE is directed (6). The expression patterns directed by these
enhancers are very similar to that of endogenous sog expression. These two enhancers
are referred to as the “primary” enhancer and the “shadow”
enhancer, respectively, based on the chronological order of their identification
rather than any functional differences. These results suggested that expression of a
gene at a particular time and in a defined space can be controlled by two redundant
enhancers.

More recently, the shadow enhancer was also shown to direct sog expression in the VM
(7). Like rho,
sog is initially expressed in the NEs in broad lateral strips.
However, by germband extension sog expression is restricted to the VM, which is
composed of specialized glial cells that secrete molecules critical for nerve cord
patterning (8). The early broad stripe of
sog expression in the NE relies on three DV determinants,
Dorsal (Dl), Zelda (Zld), and Snail (Sna) (9-11). The early broad pattern
of sog expression is believed to be dictated by both synergistic
activation between Dl and Zld across at least half of the syncytial blastoderm and
also Sna-mediated repression in the presumptive mesoderm. Like other Single-minded
(Sim) target genes, the later pattern in the VM seems to be directed by Sim (12). The sim gene encodes a
transcription factor containing a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS (bHLH-PAS) domain that
functions as a master regulator of VM differentiation in the
Drosophila central nervous system (CNS) (13). Although previous gainand loss-of-function studies have
shown that sog expression in the VM depends on Sim (7, 12), direct evidence that the midline enhancer activity of the shadow
enhancer requires typical Sim-binding sites has not yet been obtained. These
findings indicate that one of two redundant enhancers responsible for early
sog expression can also direct late expression of
sog at a different location via an unknown mechanism.

Here we present evidence that the shadow enhancer midline activity has three
extraordinary features in the context of cis-regulatory DNA. First,
the minimal regions for the dual enhancer activities in the shadow enhancer cannot
be uncoupled. Second, the midline enhancer activity requires five Sim-binding sites,
two of which are noncanonical sites. Finally, loss of either the Dl- or the
Zld-binding site severely disrupts the midline enhancer activity. These results
reveal that early enhancer activity in the NE may facilitate late enhancer activity
in the VM, which presumably helps cope with the low quality of the
cis-regulatory elements that regulate late expression.

RESULTS
The midline enhancer activity of the sog shadow enhancer
cannot be uncoupled from its neurogenic ectoderm enhancer activity
The previous finding that the two rho enhancers are functionally
autonomous and geographically separable (5) raised the question of whether the ventral midline enhancer
(VME) activity of the sog shadow enhancer can be geographically uncoupled from
its neurogenic ectoderm enhancer (NEE) activity. To answer this question,
transgenic embryos containing lacZ fusion genes directed by
truncated versions of the shadow enhancers were generated, and
lacZ expression in the NE and VM was tested by whole-mount
in situ hybridization with an antisense
lacZ RNA probe (Fig.
1). Compared with the 0.88-kb full-length construct (Fig. 1A and B), the 0.68-kb region was
sufficient for each of the enhancer activities (Fig. 1C and D). However, a5’ ∼100-bp deletion of the
0.68-kb construct (0.58 kb) severely interfered with VM lacZ
expression (Fig. 1E and F), while a
5’ 230-bp truncation (0.45 kb) failed to drive sog expression in the NE
and VM (Fig. 1G and H). These results
suggest that the 0.58-kb region is inadequate for VME activity and that the
5’ limit of the minimal NEE must lie between the 5’ ends of the
0.58-kb and 0.45-kb enhancers. The loss of ∼70 bp at the 3’ end of
the 0.68-kb construct ablated sog expression in both the NE and VM (Fig. 1I and J). Moreover, simultaneous loss
of the distal (5’ ∼100 bp) and proximal (3’ ∼70 bp)
elements, which were previously shown to be critical for the midline enhancer
activity (7), resulted in the severe
reduction of sog expression in the NE and VM (Fig. 1K and L). These results indicate that both the distal and
proximal elements are required to drive sog expression in the NE as well as the
VM and thus that the minimal regions for the two enhancer activities appear to
overlap.

Fig. 1. The midline enhancer activity of the sog shadow enhancer cannot be
physically uncoupled from its neurogenic ectoderm enhancer (NEE)
activity. Schematic diagrams of the six lacZ constructs
used for P element-mediated germline transformation are shown. Various
regions of the 0.88-kb enhancer were placed upstream of the
even-skipped (eve) minimal
promoter, followed by the lacZ-coding region. Wild-type
(yw) embryos were injected with each construct and
lacZ expression was analyzed by in
situ hybridization with an antisense lacZ
RNA probe. Early (stage 5) and late (stage 10) embryos are oriented to
show lateral (A, C, E, G, I and K) and ventral (B, D, F, H, J and L)
views, respectively, with the anterior view on the left.
The sog shadow enhancer contains three canonical Sim-binding
sites, one of which is statistically functional
Although the proximal and distal elements, which are critical for VME activity,
do not contain any Sim-binding sites, sog expression in the VM
has been shown to require Sim (7, 12). This apparent contradiction led us to
determine the number of Sim-binding motifs in the sog locus,
how good their qualities are, and whether they can form a statistically
significant cluster with the Dl, Zld, and Sna. Since no transcription factor has
yet been identified that interacts cooperatively with Sim, it is extremely hard
to find functional clusters of Sim-binding motifs. Thus, although it is highly
unlikely that Sim, Dl, Zld, and Sna cooperate via simultaneous site occupancy
during embryogenesis, assessing the statistical significance of the clusters
formed by the four transcription factors may aid the identification of
functional Sim-binding motif clusters. To this end, ClusterDraw analyses were
performed with position frequency matrices (PFMs) (Fig. S1) of the DNA-binding
motifs (Fig. 2A-D) for Dl, Zld, Sna, and
Sim. The ClusterDraw algorithm is an r-scan-based program that
has been used to identify the binding motifs and binding clusters of specific
combinations of transcription factors (14, 15). We hypothesized
that Sim-binding sites in the sog locus that yield cumulative
match probability P values (y-axis) higher than the cut-off
values and that are located nearby or within the Dl, Zld, and Sna cluster will
generate statistically significant cluster P values (z-axis) with the Dl, Zld,
and Sna PFMs. A ClusterDraw analysis of the Dl, Zld, and Sna PFMs over a
∼62-kb genomic region encompassing the sog locus (Fig. 2E) identified two clusters, which correspond
precisely to the previously identified primary enhancer and shadow enhancer
(Fig. 2, dotted boxes and Table S1).
The similar analysis was performed with the Dl, Zld, Sna, and Sim PFMs and
produced a pattern comparable with that shown in Fig. 2E, except that the match probability value corresponding to
the shadow enhancer was higher than that of panel E (Fig. 2F, S2, S3, and Table S1). This finding indicates
that the involvement of Sim in the preformed cluster containing Dl, Zld, and Sna
increased the statistical significance of its cluster P value. This result
prompted us to map the Sim-binding motifs in the shadow enhancer. Combined
GenePalette (16) and ClusterDraw
analyses showed that the shadow enhancer contains three Sim-binding sites within
the Dl, Zld, and Sna cluster (Fig. 1G),
two of which yielded match probability P values lower than the cut-off. Thus,
the ClusterDraw analysis excluded these two sites upon formation of the cluster
(Fig. S3). Intriguingly, the shadow enhancer does not contain the
5’-NNACGTG-3’ sequence (in which “N” represents any
nucleotides), which is found at least once in each sim target
enhancer experimentally tested so far (4, 17). These findings suggest
that the sog shadow enhancer midline activity might be derived
from these three Sim-binding sites.

Fig. 2. ClusterDraw analyses of a ∼62-kb genomic region encompassing
the sog locus. DNA binding sequences for Dorsal (Dl)
(A), Zelda (Zld) (B), Snail (Sna) (C), and Single-minded (Sim) (D) are
graphically represented as sequence logos (21). The WebLogo 3.3 algorithm was used to build
the sequence logos with the position frequency matrices (PFMs) (Fig. S1)
of the Dl-, Zld-, Sna-, and Simbinding DNA sequences. ClusterDraw
analysis with the Dl, Zld, and Sna PFMs (E) yielded two statistically
significant match probability values, the highest and the second highest
of which coincide with the primary and shadow enhancers, respectively
(dotted boxes, Table S1). The best P values of these two clusters are
highly similar to each other. The same analysis was performed with the
Dl, Zld, Sna, and Sim PFMs (F). This analysis produced a pattern
comparable to that shown in panel E, except that the match probability
value corresponding to the shadow enhancer was higher than that shown in
panel E (Fig. S2, S3, and Table S1). This finding suggests that the
addition of the Sim PFM increased the statistical significance of the
preformed cluster of Dl, Zld, and Sna in the shadow enhancer. Gene
models (G) over the analyzed genomic region are depicted below panel F.
Binding sites for Dl, Zld, Sna, and Sim identified by GenePalette and
ClusterDraw are depicted in the sog shadow enhancer.
GenePalette analysis matched three Sim sites to the consensus sequence
(D), whereas ClusterDraw selected only one Sim site (marked with an
asterisk) (Fig. S3 and Table S1). This discrepancy may be at least
partially due to the statistically low qualities of the other two
sites.
Midline enhancer activity depends on five Sim-binding sites, two of which are
noncanonical sequences
We next investigated whether the shadow enhancer contains sequences that are
similar to the Sim-binding motif, even though these sequences do not perfectly
match with the Sim consensus sequence. GenePalette searches permitting a
one-nucleotide mismatch identified two noncanonical Sim-binding sites in the
distal element (Fig. 3A, ST1, and ST2).
Each Sim- binding site contained one mismatch at the third position from the
5’ end of the site, implying that the binding affinities of these sites to
Sim are much lower than those of the canonical Sim-binding sites.

Fig. 3. Midline enhancer activity depends on five Sim-binding sites, two of
which are noncanonical sequences. (A) The 0.68-kb sog shadow enhancer
contains five Sim-binding sites. The first two sites (ST1 and ST2)
appear to be noncanonical sequences because each site contains one
nucleotide mismatch relative to the core consensus sequence (the
Sim-binding site consensus sequence is shown in Fig. 2D). The mismatched nucleotides are
underlined. The remaining three sites (ST3, ST4, and ST5) contain the
core GCGTG consensus sequence. (B-E) Wild type and mutant versions of
the 0.68-kb enhancer construct were used to generate
lacZ transformation constructs. Cloning of the
transformation constructs, germline transformation, and in
situ hybridization were performed as in Fig. 1. Two noncanonical
Sim-binding sites (ST1 and ST2, red open triangles) were identified by
the GenePalette motif search with one nucleotide mismatch allowed. ST3,
ST4, and ST5 are depicted as red closed triangles. Deletions of each
Sim-binding site were introduced by PCR-mediated site-directed
mutagenesis.
Although the previous ClusterDraw analyses suggested that two of the three
Sim-binding sites were statistically less significant, the functionality of
these sites had not been investigated in vivo. Thus, we used
transgenic embryos to determine whether expression of the lacZ
transgene containing the 0.68-kb enhancer in the VM requires the five
Sim-binding motifs. Compared with the 0.68-kb minimal VME construct (Fig. 3B), mutation of the five Sim sites in
the 0.68-kb construct (0.68ΔST12345) abrogated lacZ
expression in the VM (Fig. 3C),
suggesting that at least some of the five Sim sites are necessary for the
expression of the reporter gene. We next investigated whether the complete
repression of lacZ expression was due to the loss of the two
noncanonical sites in the distal element (ST1 and ST2) or the remaining three
sites (ST3-ST5). Selective mutations in the ST1 and ST2 sites (0.68ΔST12)
also yielded significantly reduced expression of the lacZ
transgene in the VM (Fig. 3D). However,
the lacZ transcript was barely detectable in transgenic embryos
containing a 0.68-kb construct harboring mutations in the ST3, ST4, and ST5
sites (0.68ΔST 345) (Fig. 3E). These
results suggest that while the VME activity of the sog shadow enhancer relies on
all five Sim-binding sites, the three canonical binding sites may be more
crucial than the two noncanonical binding sites for driving sog
expression in the VM, at least in the context of the lacZ
reporter gene.

The linked Dl- and Zld-binding sites are also required for midline enhancer
activity
The proximal element, which corresponds to the last approximately 70 bp at the 3’
end of the 0.68-kb construct, is functionally required for the midline enhancer
activity (7) but does not contain any
Sim-binding sites. Instead, it has a cluster of closely linked binding sites for
Dl, Zld, and Sna (Fig. 4, Tables S1 and
S2). The Dl-binding sites (Dl3 and 5) are located adjacent to the Zld-binding
sites (Zld1 and 3), which overlaps with the Sna-binding site. The finding that
deletion of the proximal element in the 0.68-kb construct significantly
repressed lacZ expression in the VM (Fig. 1I and J) raised the possibility that early
determinants such as Dl and Zld may play a role in sog expression in the
midline. To test this possibility, transgenic embryos containing various mutant
versions of the 0.68-kb construct were generated and the levels of
lacZ expression in the resultant embryos were determined by
wholemount in situ hybridization using an antisense
lacZ RNA probe. The 0.68-kb construct contains five
Dl-binding sites and three Zld-binding sites. Of these sites, the Dl3-Zld1 and
Dl5-Zld3 sites are tightly linked to one another (Fig. 4, schematic representation left of panel A). To
determine whether the Dl-binding sites are necessary for the midline enhancer
activity, the three Dl sites (Dl1, Dl3, and Dl5) were mutated (0.68ΔDl135).
Compared with the parental 0.68-kb construct (Fig. 4A and B), the 0.68ΔDl135 construct did not drive
lacZ expression in any region of the embryo (Fig. 4C and D), suggesting that the three
Dl sites play critical roles for sog expression in both the NE and the VM. The
loss of lacZ expression in the VM in the absence of the three
Dl sites is particularly intriguing, since Dl activity declines as embryogenesis
proceeds and D1 finally becomes functionally inactive before the formation of
the VM (4). Moreover, the loss of two Dl
sites, Dl3 and Dl5 (which are linked with the Zld sites) (0.68ΔDl 35), is
sufficient to block the activities of the 0.68-kb enhancer in the NE and the VM
(Fig. 4E and F).

Fig. 4. The linked Dl- and Zld-binding sites in the 0.68-kb enhancer are
required for its VM enhancer activity. Wild type and mutant versions of
the 0.68-kb enhancer were used to generate lacZ
transformation constructs. Cloning of the transformation constructs,
germline transformation, and in situ hybridization were
performed as in Fig. 1. Lateral
(A, C, E, G, and I, stage 5) and ventral (B, D, F, H, and J, stage 10)
views of the embryos are shown; the anterior side is on the left. The
0.68-kb minimal enhancer contains five Dl-binding and three Zld-binding
sites. Of these, the Dl3-Zld1 and Dl5-Zld3 sites are closely linked.
Intriguingly, Zld1 and Zld3 coincide with two Sna-binding sites to form
two modules, each of which is composed of a combination of Dl-, Zld-,
and Sna-binding sites.
We next asked if the Zld-binding sites linked to the Dl-binding sites also
contribute to the midline enhancer activity, since Zld has been shown to
facilitate the occupancy of Dl to its cognate binding motif (11). Mutagenesis of all the Zld sites
(0.68ΔZld123) or of the two linked sites (0.68ΔZld1 3) led to severe
reduction of lacZ expression in the VM (Fig. 4H and J), consistent with the results of the
0.68ΔDl135 and 0.68ΔDl 35 constructs. The only difference in the
lacZ expression patterns obtained with the 0.68ΔZld123
and 0.68ΔZld1 3 constructs is the width of the lacZ expression stripe in
the NE (Fig. 4G and I). The
lacZ expression pattern driven by 0.68ΔZld123 is
narrower than that driven by 0.68ΔZld1 3. These different thresholds in the
Dl concentration gradient are presumably due to a synergistic interaction
between Zld2 and Dl4 in the 0.68ΔZld1 3 construct. These results suggest
that the Dl and Zld binding motifs associated with the two Dl, Zld, and Sna
clusters are indispensable for sog expression in the VM.

DISCUSSION
Shadow enhancers were initially identified as one of two separate enhancers that
drive the same or similar expression patterns of many Dl target genes (6). A recent study showed that the shadow
enhancer directs sequential sog expression patterns in both the NE
and the VM (7). Here, we characterized for
the first time three unusual DNA features of the sog shadow enhancer.

The most intriguing finding in the current study is that the Zld-binding sites in the
0.68-kb construct are required for its VME activity. The zld gene
encodes a maternal transcription activator that is ubiquitously expressed in
blastoderm embryos until the end of the nuclear cleavage cycle 14 (18) and is believed to drive the early broad
stripe of sog expression in the NE via cooperative site occupancy with Dl (10). Why did the sog shadow enhancer lose its
VME activity upon the loss of the Zld-binding sites? The simplest explanation for
this finding is that Zld may function as a pioneer factor to potentiate the VME
activity of the shadow enhancer. A pioneer factor is a transcription factor that
confers transcriptional competency upon inactive target genes by binding condensed
chromatin prior to the binding of other transcription factors (19). It is plausible that Zld establishes an open chromatin
environment for NEE activity before early sog activation in the NE
and enhances binding of Dl via synergistic interaction during sog activation in the
NE. The established chromatin environment may even be maintained for further site
occupancy by subsequent transcription factors such as Sim. The recent finding that
Zld binding to regulatory DNA is strongly correlated with increased chromatin
accessibility (11) supports this
explanation. Alternatively, direct synergistic interaction between Zld and Sim in
the VM may explain the requirement for the Zld-binding sites for the VME activity,
because a zygotic Zld transcript was found in the VM during late embryogenesis (20). However, the Zld protein encoded by this
zygotic transcript contains only one out of the 4 C2H2 zinc
finger motifs that are known to bind typical Zldbinding DNA sequences. Thus, it is
presently unclear whether the late version of Zld expressed in the VM is actually
able to directly bind Zld-binding sites.

The finding that the midline enhancer activity of the shadow enhancer depends on the
two noncanonical Sim-binding sites and the three canonical Sim-binding sites can
also be interpreted in this context. The shadow enhancer does not contain any
‘ACGTG’ Sim-binding motifs, at least one of which is found in all known
Sim target enhancers. Instead, its midline enhancer activity depends on five Sim
sites that appear to have relatively low affinities for Sim. The number of
Sim-binding sites in the VME has been shown to define the onset timing of its target
gene expression in the VM (4). Sim target
genes fall into approximately two categories, early and late, and early enhancers
contain more Sim-binding sites than late enhancers. Like rho, sog
appears to be an early Sim target gene because the onset of its expression is
similar to that of Sim itself in the VM (7).
Accordingly, the sog VME is hypothesized to have at least four
high-affinity Sim-binding sites; instead, however, it has five poor quality Sim
sites. Thus, the shadow enhancer may need alternative ways of coping with the
inefficient capability to recruit the master regulatory protein Sim. It is
conceivable that the euchromatic environment pre-established by Zld may bypass the
requirement of Sim-mediated chromatin decondensation required by most Sim target
enhancers. This pre-established euchromatic environment facilitates the initial
recruitment of Sim via low-affinity sites and thus enhances instant communication
between the shadow enhancer and its target promoter.
