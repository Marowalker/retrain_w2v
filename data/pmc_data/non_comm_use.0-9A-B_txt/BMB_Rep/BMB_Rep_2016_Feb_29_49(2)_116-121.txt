INTRODUCTION
Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a major source of ATP production
in eukaryotic cells. OXPHOS takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane
via five OXPHOS complexes including NADH dehydrogenase (OXPHOS
I), succinate dehydrogenase (OXPHOS II), ubiquinone cytochrome c
oxidoreductase (OXPHOS III), cytochrome c, cytochrome oxidase (OXPHOS IV) and ATP
synthase (OXPHOS V). The energy obtained by electron transport from NADH or
succinate to oxygen via the OXPHOS I-III-IV or II-III-IV
supercomplex is utilized to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane,
creating a proton gradient. The proton gradient is ultimately used by ATP synthase
(OXPHOS V) to generate ATP from ADP and Pi. In addition
to ATP production, the mitochondria also contribute to cellular stress responses
such as autophagy and apoptosis (1). For
example, cytochrome c, a key participant in ATP synthesis, is
translocated from the mitochondria to the cytosol, to trigger programmed cell death
after cellular exposure to different apoptotic stimuli (2).

Lipid rafts are plasma membrane subdomains that consist of cholesterol and
glycosphingolipids (3). Due to the long and
saturated fatty acids of glycosphingolipids and the stiff four-ring structure of
cholesterol, lipid raft subdomains have more rigid property than other phospholipid
compartments with short and unsaturated fatty acids in the plasma membrane (4). Thus, the lipid rafts are easily isolated
from other cellular organelles based on their detergent insolubility (3, 5). The detergent-resistant lipid rafts contain many different receptors and
their downstream signaling molecules, making the lipid rafts serve as the center for
signal transduction activity (6-9).

Surprisingly, various proteomic analyses reveal that the lipid rafts also concentrate
mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins in different cell lines such as HepG2 hepatocytes
(10), C2C12 myotubes (11), human adipocytes (6), THP-1 monocytes (12, 13), RNK (natural killer)
cells (14) and human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) (15, 16). The observation of mitochondrial OXPHOS
proteins in the plasma membrane lipid rafts has been biochemically demonstrated by
different experimental approaches such as proteomics, subcellular fractionation and
surface biotin-labeling in different cell lines and tissues (10, 11, 17). However, the finding of mitochondrial
proteins in the lipid rafts has also raised the possibility of mitochondrial
contamination during lipid raft isolation or the possible existence of mitochondrial
lipid rafts (6).

To resolve the controversy, the in situ localization of
mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins in the plasma membrane must be investigated. In this
study, we show that OXPHOS I-V complexes are localized in the sarcolemmal cell
membrane of skeletal muscle tissue and C2C12 myotubes. Cytochrome c
is also localized in the sarcolemma based on total internal resonance fluorescence
(TIRF) microscopy. The sarcolemmal localization of OXPHOS complexes may provide
novel insights into the non-canonical functions of OXPHOS in the sarcolemma of
skeletal muscle.

RESULTS
A portion of OXPHOS complexes is not localized in the mitochondria
The existence of mitochondrial proteins in the plasma membrane has been
demonstrated by different experimental approaches such as proteomics, lipid raft
and plasma membrane isolation and surface biotin-labeling in different cell
lines and tissues. However, there is no report describing in
situ localization of the mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes in the
plasma membrane. To visualize the localization of the OXPHOS complexes in the
sarcolemmal cell membrane, we used different anti-OXPHOS antibodies against the
NDUFB6 subunit of OXPHOS I, SDHA subunit of OXPHOS II, core I subunit of OXPHOS
III, COX4I1 subunit of OXPHOS IV and ATP synthases α and β for
immunofluorescence. Each of these antibodies detected a single band
corresponding to each OXPHOS subunit in the immunoblotting of C2C12 myoblasts
and myotubes (Fig. S1), suggesting that the immunofluorescent signals for OXPHOS
subunits may be specific.

We carried out immunofluorescence in mouse gastrocnemius. In cross-sections and
longitudinal sections (Fig. 1 and Fig.
S2), a portion of immunofluorescent signals of OXPHOS subunits in the sarcolemma
was not stained with MitoTracker. This indicates that OXPHOS complexes in the
sarcolemma were not conjugated to the mitochondria. It should be noted that
there was no immunofluorescent signal in gastrocnemius tissues treated with mock
IgG and secondary antibody (Fig. 1),
showing that the immunofluorescent signals were specific for the indicated
OXPHOS subunit.

Fig. 1. A portion of OXPHOS complexes is expressed in the sarcolemma.
Gastrocnemii were isolated from 8-week-old male mice. The longitudinally
sectioned muscles were co-stained with Mito-Tracker and an anti-NDUFB6
(OX I), SDHA (OX II), core I subunit of OXPHOS III (OX III), COX4I1 (OX
IV) or ATP synthase α or β (ATPα or β) antibody. The
boxed areas are enlarged in merged images. Scale bar = 10
μm.
A portion of OXPHOS complexes is co-localized with caveolin-3 in the
sarcolemma.
Next, we investigated the co-localization of OXPHOS subunits with caveolin-3 in
mouse gastrocnemius muscle tissue by immunofluorescence. It should be noted that
caveolin-3 is specifically expressed in the sarcolemmal caveolae, which are
plasma membrane invaginations formed from lipid rafts (18, 19). As shown
in Fig. 2, OXPHOS subunits were
co-localized with caveolin-3 in the sarcolemma, indicating that OXPHOS complexes
are expressed in the sarcolemma. These fluorescent signals corresponding to the
OXPHOS subunits and caveolin-3 were specific because there were no background
signals in samples incubated with mock IgG.

Fig. 2. A portion of OXPHOS complexes is co-localized with caveolin-3 in the
sarcolemma. Gastrocnemii were isolated from 8-week-old male mice. The
co-localization of caveolin-3 with each OXPHOS subunit [NDUFB6 (OX I),
SDHA (OX II), core I subunit of OXPHOS III (OX III), COX4I1 (OX IV) or
ATP synthase α or β (ATPα or β)] was determined from
the cross-sectioned muscle. The boxed areas are enlarged in merged
images. Scale bar = 10 μm.
A portion of OXPHOS complexes is exposed to the cell surface
ATP synthase is ectopically expressed on the cell surface and a portion of each
OXPHOS complex is localized in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle as shown in
Figs. 1 and 2. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the
mitochondrial matrix-facing OXPHOS subunits may also be exposed to the cell
surface if the OXPHOS complexes are localized in the sarcolemma as proposed in
Fig. S3. In order to address this issue, we determined the surface expression of
matrix-facing OXPHOS subunits in non-permeabilized C2C12 myotubes by
immunofluorescence. For these experiments, we selected antibodies against NDUFV2
(a subunit of OXPHOS I), SDHA (a subunit of OXPHOS II), UQCR2 (a subunit of
OXPHOS III), COX_IV (a subunit of OXPHOS IV), and ATP_β(a subunit of OXPHOS
V) because all of these antigens are exposed to the mitochondrial matrix. As
shown in Fig. 3A, immunofluorescent
signals for OXPHOS subunits were found along with the sarcolemma in
non-permeabilized multinuclear myotubes. These data indicate that the
matrix-facing OXPHOS subunits are also expressed on the cell surface. It should
be noted that there was no fluorescent signal for cytochrome c
or mock IgG (Fig. 3A). The lack of a
surface signal for cytochrome c suggests that cytochrome
c faces toward the cytosol if it localizes in the
sarcolemma.

Fig. 3. OXPHOS complexes are ectopically expressed in the sarcolemma. (A)
Immunofluorescence for OXPHOS proteins [NDUFV2 (OX I), SDHA (OX II),
UQCR2 (OX III), COXIV (OX IV), ATP β (OX V) and Cytochrome c (Cyt
c)] was carried out using 4-day-differentiated C2C12 myotubes without a
permeabilization step. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Scale
bar = 10 μm. (B) Muscle fibers were isolated from extensor
digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of 8-week-old mice. Immunofluorescence
for OXPHOS subunits was carried out without a permeabilization step.
Scale bar = 10 μm. (C) Cross-sectioned and longitudinally sectioned
mouse gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed by immunofluorescence with an
anti-cytochrome c antibody and MitoTracker. Scale bar = 10 μm. (D)
Cytochrome c and caveolin-3 are co-localized in the sarcolemma of
myotubes. Immunofluorescence of cytochrome c and caveolin proteins
(caveolin-1 for myoblasts and caveolin-3 for myotubes) was observed in
C2C12 myoblasts and 3-day-differentiated myotubes using TIRF microscopy.
Scale bar = 10 μm.
To further confirm the surface expression of each OXPHOS complex, we carried out
immunofluorescence using intact muscle fibers obtained from mouse extensor
digitorum longus (EDL). After collagenase treatment, the isolated muscle fibers
were immediately stained with anti-OXPHOS antibodies without a permeabilization
step. Fig. 3B shows strong surface
expression of the OXPHOS subunits in the plasma membrane of EDL fiber. Because
there was no immunofluorescent signal for cytochrome c and mock
IgG, the surface signals for each OXPHOS are specific.

Cytochrome c is localized in the sarcolemma as well as in the
mitochondria
Because all of the OXPHOS complexes were localized in the sarcolemma of skeletal
muscle, as shown in Figs. 1-3, cytochrome c may also
be localized with other OXPHOS complexes in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle.
Therefore, we monitored the cellular localization of cytochrome
c in mouse gastrocnemius skeletal muscles by
immunohistochemistry with an anti-cytochrome c antibody. As
shown in Fig. S4, cytochrome c was highly expressed in the
sarcolemma and the mitochondria isolated from the cross-sectioned and
longitudinally sectioned mouse gastrocnemii. We further confirmed the
sarcolemmal localization of cytochrome c by immunofluorescence
in mouse gastrocnemius. As shown in Fig.
3C, cytochrome c was found in the sarcolemma that
was not co-stained with MitoTracker and in the sub-sarcolemmal mitochondria that
were co-stained with MitoTracker. It should be noted that incubation with mock
IgG did not result in any positive fluorescent signals, indicating that the
immunofluorescent signals for cytochrome c are specific.

To further confirm the sarcolemmal localization of cytochrome c,
the fluorescent signals for cytochrome c and caveolin-1 or -3
(sarcolemmal marker protein of myoblasts or myotubes) were observed in C2C12
myoblasts and myotubes under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)
microscopy which generates a high spatial resolution of fluorescent probes that
are localized in the plasma membrane or just beneath the plasma membrane. As
shown in Fig. 3D, the co-localization of
cytochrome c and caveolin-3 was observed in C2C12 myotubes by
TIRF microscopy, but cytochrome c was not co-localized with
caveolin-1 in myoblasts. Thus, all these data indicate that cytochrome
c is localized with all of the OXPHOS complexes in the
sarcolemma of skeletal muscles.

Sarcolemmal OXPHOS is not involved in extracellular NADH-dependent
respiration
Based on the immunofluorescence experiments examining the OXPHOS complexes in
non-permeabilized C2C12 myotubes and EDL muscle fibers, we propose the function
of sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes as shown in Fig.
4A. According to this model, electrons may transfer from
extracellular NADH or succinate to oxygen via sarcolemmal OXPHOS I-III-IV or
II-III-IV, generating a proton gradient across the sarcolemma. Finally, the
proton gradient may be utilized to generate extracellular ATP from extracellular
ADP and Pi via sarcolemmal OXPHOS V. Based on this topology of
sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes, extracellular NADH may induce oxygen consumption
in the sarcolemma. In order to address this hypothesis, we measured the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) of C2C12 myotubes in the presence of NADH. As shown in
Fig. 4B, the OCR did not change after
cellular exposure to NADH, suggesting that sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes are not
involved in extracellular NADH-dependent respiration.

Fig. 4. Sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes do not have the ability to consume
oxygen. (A) The proposed function of the sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes.
In this model, electrons are transferred from extracellular NADH to
oxygen via the sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes, generating a proton
gradient. The sarcolemmal ATP synthase generates extracellular ATP from
extracellular ADP and Pi using the proton
gradient. The proton gradient is utilized by OXPHOS V to generate
extracellular ATP from extracellular ADP and
Pi. Blue lines indicate the flow of
electrons and red lines indicate the flow of protons. (B) The oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) was measured in 4-day-differentiated C2C12
myotubes treated with different combinations of NADH (4 μM) and
rotenone (10 μM). To inhibit mitochondrial respiration, myotubes
were treated with rotenone, which is an inhibitor of OXPHOS I
complex.
DISCUSSION
The plasma membrane has two separate phases, the liquid-ordered phase (Lo)
and the liquid-disordered phase (Ld). The Lo phase, also known
as lipid rafts, shows tight packing of phospholipids with longer and saturated acyl
chains because of rigid cholesterol, whereas the Ld phase contains loose
packing of phospholipids with shorter and unsaturated acyl chains (6). Thus, lipid rafts of the Lo
phase cannot be solubilized by non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100, Brij or
NP40, and can be easily isolated from the Ld phase, based on their
detergent insolubility and low density in sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The
detergent-resistant lipid rafts contain many mitochondrial and microsomal proteins
as well as plasma membrane proteins based on proteomic analyses of various mammalian
cells and tissues (5, 6, 10-15, 17, 20, 21). These results spark a controversy that rafts contain many
contaminants originating from mitochondria and microsomes because of detergent usage
(6).

However, many mitochondrial proteins, such as ATP synthase, voltage-dependent anion
channels (VDAC) and prohibitin, have been unambiguously demonstrated to be localized
in the plasma membrane by using various experimental approaches such as cellular
fractionation, immunofluorescence, and cell surface biotinylation (10, 11, 22-26), indicating that mitochondrial proteins isolated from the
detergent-resistant lipid rafts are not simple contaminants. Thus, we investigated
the possibility that OXPHOS complexes are localized in the sarcolemma of skeletal
muscle because proteomic analysis has revealed that the detergent-resistant lipid
rafts isolated from C2C12 myotubes have many mitochondrial proteins, particularly,
many subunits of the OXPHOS complexes (11).

All of the OXPHOS complexes and cytochrome c were undoubtedly
localized in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscles as determined by immunofluorescence
(Figs. 1-3). The immunofluorescent analysis of skeletal muscle revealed that
OXPHOS proteins are highly concentrated in the sarcolemma and the mitochondria.
Because many mitochondria are also localized in sub-sarcolemmal regions based on
electron microscopy (27), it is difficult to
imagine that these OXPHOS complexes are localized in the subdomains of the
sarcolemma that do not contain mitochondria. However, we observed that some
immunofluorescent signals of OXPHOS subunits in the sarcolemma did not overlap with
MitoTracker signals that have been known to specifically accumulate in the
mitochondrial matrix (28), indicating that
OXPHOS complexes are indeed localized in the sarcolemma of skeletal muscle.

By performing immunofluorescence experiments for OXPHOS complexes in
non-permeabilized muscle fibers (Fig. 3A, B),
we determined the topology of sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes (Fig. 4A). According to this topology, mitochondrial
matrix-facing OXPHOS subunits are exposed to the extracellular space, while
mitochondrial intermembrane space-facing OXPHOS subunits are exposed to the
intracellular space. Thus, a proton gradient may be generated across the sarcolemma
by transfer of electrons from extracellular NADH to oxygen via the
sarcolemmal OXPHOS I, III and IV complexes. Finally, the sarcolemmal OXPHOS V may
utilize the electron gradient for extracellular ATP production. Indeed, purified
sarcolemma show NADH-dependent respiration activity after addition of cytochrome
c
(11). Calzia et al.
observed the OXPHOS complexes from the rod outer segment (OS), which is a continuum
of the plasma membrane in the rod cells of the vertebrate retina and reported the
observation of respiratory activity from the purified OS after addition of pyruvate
and malate (29). However, our results show
that intact C2C12 myotubes did not have NADH-dependent sarcolemmal respiration
activity (Fig. 4B). In addition, the
sarcolemmal ATP synthase is not involved in generating extracellular ATP because
extracellular ATP generation is not disrupted in C2C12 myotubes even after the
knockdown of ATP synthase β (30).

These data indicate that the sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes are not involved in
oxidative phosphorylation. Just as ectopic ATP synthase has the ability to bind to
many different ligands (apolipoprotein A-I, angiostatin, β amyloid oligomers,
etc.) (22, 23, 31, 32) and to transfer HIV-1 from antigen-presenting cells to
CD4+ cells (33), the
sarcolemmal OXPHOS complexes may have as yet unknown non-canonical functions. Thus,
a direction for future research on the sarcolemmal OXPHOS proteins is to identify
their novel non-canonical functions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and cell line
C57/BL6 male mice were housed in plastic cages on a 12:12 h light-dark
photoperiod with free access to water and food. Animals were handled according
to the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised
1985). The mouse myoblast cell line C2C12 was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, US) and cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2%
penicillin/streptomycin (WelGene, Daegu, Korea) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37℃ according to the previously
described method (34). In brief, C2C12
myoblasts at approximately 90-100% confluence were differentiated into myotubes
by using the growth medium with differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with
2% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% horse serum). Every 48 h, the differentiation
medium of the myotubes was replaced with fresh medium.

Antibodies and reagents
Different anti-OXPHOS antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad,
California, USA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
Anti-cytochrome c, anti-caveolin-1 and anti-caveolin-3
antibodies were obtained from BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA).
MitoTracker Red FM dye and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were
purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, USA). FITC-conjugated
anti-mouse IgG and Rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK). Collagenase type I and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, USA).

Immunoblotting, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry
The proteins in the whole cell lysates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels
and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The antigens were visualized by sequential
treatment with specific primary antibodies, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies,
and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit.

Intact muscle fibers of mouse extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle were
isolated with 0.2% collagenase type I in DMEM and analyzed by immunofluorescence
according to the previously described method (35). C2C12 myotubes were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10
min, left non-permeabilized and blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (5% BSA in
PBS). Subsequent incubations with primary antibodies and fluorescent-conjugated
secondary antibodies, and DAPI staining were conducted at room temperature.
Immunofluorescence images were captured by a laser scanning confocal microscope
(ZEISS LSM 510 META, Oberkochen, Germany) or a Laser TIRF-2 system (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan).

Isolated mouse gastrocnemii were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, snap-frozen in
chilled 2-methylbutane and sectioned with a cryomicrotome. The muscle sections
were subsequently incubated with blocking buffer, primary antibodies and
fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunofluorescence images were
captured by confocal microscopy.

For immunohistochemistry, mouse gastrocnemii were washed with saline and embedded
in an optimal cutting temperature compound to generate frozen cross sections and
longitudinal sections. Standard 6-μm sections were stained using the
Labeled Streptavidin Biotin kit (Dako, Produktionsvej, Glostrup, Denmark)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Measurement of oxygen consumption
The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was determined in C2C12 myoblasts and
4-day-differentiated myotubes using a Seahorse XF24 Extracellular Flux analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA). For OCR measurement, culture
media were exchanged with Dulbecco’s-modified PBS (Hyclone) 1 h before the
assay. After three baseline measurements of OCR were taken, NADH (4 μM) and
rotenone (10 μM) were separately injected into each experimental group in
different combinations.
