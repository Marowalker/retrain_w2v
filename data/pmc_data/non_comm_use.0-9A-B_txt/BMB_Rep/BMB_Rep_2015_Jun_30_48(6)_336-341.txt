study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of α-cubebenoate, a novel
compound isolated from Schisandra chinensis against
polymicrobial sepsis in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) experimental model.
Administration of α-cubebenoate strongly enhanced survival in the CLP
model. α-cubebenoate administration also markedly blocked CLP-induced lung
inflammation and increased bactericidal activity by enhancing phagocytic
activity and hydrogen peroxide generation in mouse bone marrow-derived
macrophages and neutrophils. Expression of two important inflammatory cytokines,
IL-1β and IL-6, was strongly increased in the CLP model, and this was
dramatically blocked by α-cubebenoate. Lymphocyte apoptosis and caspase-3
activation, which are associated with immune paralysis during sepsis, were
markedly attenuated by α-cubebenoate. Taken together, our findings indicate
that α-cubebenoate, a natural compound isolated from Schisandra
chinensis, is a powerful potential anti-septic agent. [BMB Reports

==== Body
INTRODUCTION
Sepsis is a life-threatening, infection-induced systematic inflammatory disease (1). Approximately 800,000 cases of sepsis are
estimated to occur annually in the USA with a mortality rate of about 27% (2, 3)
and estimated cost of over $17 billion per year to treat (4). Despite the severity of this medical problem, there are
no effective therapeutics against sepsis. Withdrawal of the only USA-FDA approved
anti-septic drug, Xigris® in 2011, has spurred research groups to
focus on new therapeutics against sepsis.

With regard to the pathogenesis of sepsis, failure to clear infecting microorganisms
can progress to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, leading to multi-organ
failure and septic shock (1, 5). Phagocytic cells such as macrophages and
neutrophils play key roles in the innate immune response against invading pathogens
(6). These cells effectively remove
pathogens by engulfing the pathogens and releasing reactive oxygen species such as
hydrogen peroxide (6). Infection-induced
inflammatory response is mediated by the production of proinflammatory cytokines
from inflammatory cells such as macro phages. Excessive production of
proinflammatory mediators contributes to lymphocyte apoptosis, which results in
immune paralysis (7). Based on the
pathological progress of sepsis, effective therapeutics against sepsis should show
bactericidal activity, be able to modulate the expression of cytokines, and show
anti-apoptotic activity.

Dried fruits of Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis)
("five-flavored berry") have been reported to contain diverse pharmacologically
active compounds, including C18 dibenzocyclooctadiene lignans (8-10). Some of these
lignans have been demonstrated to have anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, and
anti-inflammatory effects (8-10). Recently, we identified a novel compound,
α-cubebenoate, from S. chinensis
(11). We found that α-cubebenoate had
an anti-inflammatory effect by blocking lipopolysaccharide-induced inducible nitric
oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in macrophages (11). In this study, we investigated the in
vivo therapeutic effect of α-cubebenoate against polymicrobial
sepsis in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. We also determined the
mechanisms underlying the anti-septic effects of α-cubebenoate.

RESULTS
α-Cubebenoate administration has a therapeutic effect against
polymicrobial sepsis
To investigate the effects of α-cubebenoate against polymicrobial sepsis, we
used a CLP sepsis model. CLP surgery markedly decreased survival rate within 2
days, with a survival rate of approximately 14% (Fig. 1A). α-Cubebenoate administration strongly increased
survival rate in a dose-dependent manner, with 57% survival observed at 15 mg/kg
(Fig. 1A). Previous studies have
reported that mortality in sepsis is closely associated with lung inflammation
(12, 13). In this study, we also examined lung inflammation
using hematoxylin and eosin staining after CLP. CLP surgery markedly induced
lung inflammation, which was almost completely blocked by α-cubebenoate
administration (Fig. 1B). Because septic
patients receive antibiotics in a clinical setting, we tested the effect of
α-cubebenoate against sepsis in the presence of antibiotics (gentamycin +
cephalosporin). α-Cubebenoate administration enhanced survival rate even
further in the presence of antibiotics than in their absence (Fig. 1C).

Fig. 1. α-Cubebenoate has therapeutic effects against CLP-induced
sepsis. Several doses (0, 1, 5, 10, 15 mg/kg) of α-cubebenoate were
injected subcutaneously into CLP mice at 2, 14, 26, and 38 h after CLP
surgery (A). Vehicle (0.8% DMSO in PBS) or α-cubebenoate (15 mg/kg)
was administered at 2 and 14 h after CLP. Mice were sacrificed 24 h
after CLP surgery and lungs were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(magnification, ×100) (B). Vehicle (0.8% DMSO in PBS),
α-cubebenoate (15 mg/kg), antibiotics (10 mg/kg gentamycin plus 10
mg/kg cephalosporin), or α-cubebenoate plus antibiotics were
injected subcutaneously into CLP mice at 2, 14, 26, and 38 h post-CLP
(C). *P ＜ 0.05, **P ＜ 0.01 compared to CLP plus vehicle
control (A, C). Sample size: n = 14 mice/group (A) or 10 mice/group (C).
Data are representative of eight mice per group (B).
α-Cubebenoate administration induces bactericidal activity via
stimulation of phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species generation
CLP surgery increases the bacterial burden in peritoneal cavity. Because it is
important to control bacterial burden in peritoneal cavity to control
polymicrobial sepsis induced by CLP surgery, we investigated the effect of
α-cubebenoate on the number of CFUs in peritoneal fluid at 24 h after CLP.
As shown in Fig. 2A, α-cubebenoate
administration strongly reduced the number of CFUs in peritoneal fluid.
Bacterial killing activity is mediated by stimulation of phagocytosis from
phagocytic cells such as neutrophils (6,
14). Stimulation of mouse bone
marrow-derived macrophages with α-cubebenoate enhanced phagocytic activity
(Fig. 2B). Hydrogen peroxide is an
important weapon against invading pathogens (6). We therefore tested the effect of α-cubebenoate on
hydrogen peroxide production from mouse neutrophils. As shown in Fig. 2C, stimulation of neutrophils with
α-cubebenoate significantly enhanced hydrogen peroxide production. These
results suggest that α-cubebenoate stimulates bacterial killing activity
via phagocytosis and hydrogen peroxide generation from mouse bone marrow-derived
macrophages and neutrophils.

Fig. 2. α-Cubebenoate stimulates bactericidal activity. (A) Vehicle
(0.8% DMSO in PBS) or α-cubebenoate (15 mg/kg) was injected into
CLP mice 2 and 14 h after CLP surgery. Peritoneal lavage fluid collected
24 h after sham operation, CLP, or CLP plus α-cubebenoate
administration was cultured overnight on blood-agar base plates at
37℃, and CFUs were determined. (B) Mouse bone marrow-derived
macrophages (2 × 105) were resuspended in 200 μl
PBS and preincubated with or without α-cubebenoate for 30 min.
Then, cells were incubated with FITC-dextran (1 mg/ml) at 37℃ for
30 min. After fixing cells, phagocytic uptake was analyzed on a flow
cytometer. The result is representative of three independent
experiments. (C) Mouse neutrophils were stimulated with vehicle (0.1%
DMSO in PBS) or α-cubebenoate (100 μg/ml) for 15 min. The
amount of hydrogen peroxide produced from mouse neutrophils was measured
using a flow cytometer. Data are expressed as mean ± SD; n = 5 (A),
3 (C). *P ＜ 0.05 (A, C)
α-Cubebenoate administration decreases proinflammatory cytokine
production in a CLP sepsis model
Sepsis is an infectious inflammatory disease (1, 15, 16). Infection by pathogenic
microorganisms stimulates production of excessive amounts of proinflammatory
cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6 (1). We found that CLP surgery strongly induced the production of
proinflammatory cytokines at 24 h after surgery (Fig. 3A, B). However, α-cubebenoate administration strongly
decreased the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6
(Fig. 3A, B). In particular, the
level of IL-1β returned to sham levels in response to α-cubebenoate
administration (Fig. 3A). These results
demonstrate that α-cubebenoate administration has an anti-inflammatory
effect in polymicrobial sepsis.

Fig. 3. Effects of α-cubebenoate on CLP- or LPS-induced cytokine
production. (A, B) Vehicle (0.8% DMSO in PBS) or α-cubebenoate (15
mg/kg) was injected into CLP mice at 2 and 14 h after CLP surgery.
Separate groups of animals were subjected to sham, CLP plus vehicle, or
CLP plus α-cubebenoate treatment. Peritoneal fluid was collected at
24 h after CLP. Cytokine levels in peritoneal fluid were determined by
ELISA analysis. Panels A, B display results for IL-1β and IL-6
respectively. (C, D) Mouse splenocytes were stimulated with PBS or LPS
(100 ng/ml). After 15 min, cells were stimulated with vehicle (0.1% DMSO
in PBS) or α-cubebenoate (100 μg/ml) for 4 h. IL-1β (C)
and IL-6 (D) levels were measured by ELISA. Data are expressed as mean
± SD (n = 8). **P ＜ 0.01 ***P ＜ 0.001 (A-D). Mouse
splenocytes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS in the absence or
presence of α-cubebenoate (100 μg/ml) for 0, 30, or 60 min
(E). The levels of Iκβ-α were determined by Western blot.
Data are presented as representative of three independent experiments
(E).
We also tested the effect of α-cubebenoate on LPS-induced cytokine
production by mouse splenocytes. Stimulation of mouse splenocytes with LPS
induced the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and
IL-6 (Fig. 3C, D). Preincubation of mouse
splenocytes with α-cubebenoate prior to LPS stimulation blocked the
production of these cytokines (Fig. 3C,
D). Since LPS stimulates the production of proin- flammatory cytokine such as
IL-6 via the activation of NF-κB (17, 18), and
IκB-α degradation is associated with NF-κB activation (19), we tested the effect of
α-cubebenoate on the LPS-stimulated NF-κB activity by monitoring
IκB-α degradation. LPS stimulated IκB-α degradation in mouse
splenocytes, which was markedly blocked by α-cubebenoate (Fig. 3E). These findings indicate that
α-cubebenoate blocks the activation of TLR-induced signaling such as
NF-κB, thereby decreasing the expression of inflammatory cytokines.

α-Cubebenoate administration blocks lymphocyte apoptosis in the
spleen
Lymphocyte apoptosis is closely associated with the pathological process of
sepsis (1, 20). We found that CLP surgery was a strong inducer of
lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleen (Fig.
4A). Lymphocyte apoptosis in the spleen was markedly reduced by
α-cubebenoate administration (Fig.
4A), suggesting that α-cubebenoate has anti-apoptotic activity
against polymicrobial sepsis. The numbers of apoptotic cells were quantified by
counting TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 4B).
α-Cubebenoate administration strongly decreased apoptotic cell number
(Fig. 4B).

Fig. 4. α-Cubebenoate protects against CLP-induced apoptosis in the
spleen. (A) Vehicle (0.8% DMSO in PBS) or α-cubebenoate (15 mg/kg)
was injected into CLP mice 2 and 14 h after CLP surgery. Spleens were
collected 24 h after sham, CLP plus vehicle, or CLP plus
α-cubebenoate administration, and analyzed by TUNEL assay. (B)
TUNEL-positive cells from the spleens of mice described in (A) were
quantified. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (n = 8). **P ＜
0.01 (B) Spleens from the mice described in (A) were subjected to
immunohistochemistry with cleaved-caspase-3 antibody (magnification,
×100). Data are representative of eight mice per group (A,
C).
Lymphocyte apoptosis is mediated by the activation of caspase-3 (20-22). Consistent with this, caspase-3 activity was increased by CLP
in our study, and showed a positive correlation with increased lymphocyte
apoptosis in the spleen (Fig. 4B).
α-Cubebenoate administration strongly decreased CLP surgery-induced
caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4C).

DISCUSSION
Despite improvements in health care over the last two decades, the incidence and
mortality rates of sepsis are still high (2,
3). The only anti-sepsis agent that was
approved by the US FDA to treat sepsis, Xigris®, was withdrawn from
the market due to failure to show effective therapeutic effects in clinical settings
(23). In addition to determining the
mechanisms involved in sepsis, development of therapeutic agents to treat sepsis is
paramount. In this study, we demonstrated that a naturally occurring compound
isolated from S. chinensis, α-cubebenoate, had a strong
therapeutic effect against experimentally -induced polymicrobial sepsis. S.
chinensis has been consumed by humans to enhance immunity against
infections for a long period of time; our results provide the scientific rationale
for the anti-infective activity of S. chinensis.

Sepsis is induced by infection by diverse microorganisms, leading to a systemic
inflammatory response (1). Therefore,
control of invading microorganism is essential for control of sepsis. Our
experimental sepsis model involved CLP surgery to induce the release of
microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in bacterial dissemination via
the blood circu lation. α-Cubebenoate had anti-septic activity, as evidenced by
the decrease in bacterial CFUs in the CLP polymicrobial sepsis model after
administration of α-cubebenoate (Fig.
2). Because α-cubebenoate strongly stimulated not only phagocytic
activity but also hydrogen peroxide production from mouse bone marrow-derived
macrophages and neutrophils, we reasoned that the bactericidal activity of
α-cubebenoate was due to its enhancement of phagocytic cell activity.
Therapeutic effect of α-cubebenoate was further enhanced in mice that received
antibiotics versus α-cubebenoate alone or antibiotics alone (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that
α-cubebenoate may have a different mode of action from that of antibiotics.

Because sepsis is a systemic inflammatory disease that is characterized by increased
levels of proinflammatory cytokines, control of these proinflammatory cytokines is
essential to counteract sepsis. In this study, we demonstrated that CLP-induced
proinflammatory cytokine production was effectively reduced by α-cubebenoate
administration (Fig. 3A). Based on the
finding that α-cubebenoate also blocks the LPS-stimulated production of
proinflammatory cytokines in mouse splenocytes, we hypothesize that
α-cubebenoate may lock the signaling pathway induced by LPS in mouse
splenocytes. Because LPS-induced proinflammtory cytokine production is mediated by
the activation of an important transcription factor, NF-κB (17, 18), we tested the effect of α-cubebenoate on the LPS-stimulated
NF-κB activity by monitoring IκB-α degradation. The incubation of
mouse splenocytes with α-cubebenoate prior to LPS stimulation markedly blocked
LPS-induced IκB-α degradation (Fig.
3E). The result suggests that α-cubebenoate may block LPS-induced
TLR4 signaling by inhibiting NF-κB activity. In a previous report,
α-cubebenoate decreased LPS-stimulated PGE2 production, COX-2
expression, and JNK activity in macrophages (11). Taken together, these findings suggest that α-cubebenoate
blocks LPS-induced TLR4 signaling, resulting in inhibition of the production of
several important inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6, and
PGE2. Our results strongly indicate that a natural product isolated
from S. chinensis, namely α-cubebenoate, may be a useful
material to treat sepsis.
