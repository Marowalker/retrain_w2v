is known for bone marrow (BM) niche in leukemia patients. Our recent study on
BMs of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients showed that the mesenchymal stromal
cells (MSCs) are altered during leukemic conditions in a clinical
course-dependent manner. Leukemic blasts caused reprogramming of transcriptomes
in MSCs and remodeling of niche cross-talk, selectively suppressing normal
primitive hematopoietic cells while supporting leukemogenesis and
chemo-resistance. Notably, differences in BM stromal remodeling were correlated
to heterogeneity in subsequent clinical courses of AML, i.e., low numbers of
mesenchymal progenitors at initial diagnosis were correlated to complete
remission for 5-8 years, and high contents of mesenchymal progenitor or MSCs
correlated to early or late relapse, respectively. Thus, stromal remodeling by
leukemic cell is an intrinsic part of leukemogenesis that can contribute to the
clonal dominance of leukemic cells over normal hematopoietic cells, and can
serve as a biomarker for prediction of prognosis. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(8):

Accumulating studies have pointed out the importance of bone marrow microenvironment in
regulating the behavior and cell fate of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells. The
microenvironmental regulation of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) mostly occurs in
a specialized architecture of bone marrows (BM) referred to as stem cell niche, where
the majority of HSCs reside and interact with stromal cells. Studies have shown that two
types of niche exist in the bone marrow:endosteal osteoblastic niche and
vascular/peri-sinusoidal niche. Although these two niches are geographically distinct,
they share common cellular compositions. They are mostly comprised of mesenchymal
stromal cells with participation of sinus endothelial cells and other cellular
components. These niche cells are engaged in cross-talks with normal HSCs primarily
through CXCL-12/CXCR-4, Jagged-1/Notch, and other signaling pathways (reviewed by Oh
& Kwon, Stem Cells 2010, 28 (7); 1243-9, doi: 10.1002/stem.453). HSCs are regulated
for self-renewal, quiescence, survival, and differentiation in the context of
microenvironmental regulation.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous clonal disorder of hematopoietic progenitor
cells, can lead to excessive proliferation of malignant progenitor cells. Recent studies
have shown that leukemia stem cells (LSCs), a subpopulation of leukemia cells, are
responsible for the development, resistance, and relapse of leukemic cells in patients.
LSCs arise from the transformation of HSCs or re-acquisition of self-renewing potential
in committed progenitors. They share some common properties of normal HSCs. When
transplanted into mice, these LSCs can engraft in bone marrow and compete for niche with
normal HSCs, suggesting that these LSCs might similarly interact with niche cells in
bone marrow.Thus, emerging concept on LSC has pointed to the influence of stem cell
niche for leukemia cells. However, key issues remain unclear is the impact of leukemic
conditions on the niche and the significance of BM niche on leukemogenic process itself.
Regarding the niche under leukemic conditions, several lines of animal studies have
shown that leukemia cells can alter the condition of mesenchymal niche. A transgenic
model of chronic myeloid leukemia has exhibited defective homing and retention of HSCs
in the niche due to decreased CXCL12 in BM MSCs. Similarly, MSCs or osteoblastic cells
are altered in the bone marrow of leukemia animals induced by bcr-abl. These studies
have shown that the mesenchymal niche is altered under leukemogenic conditions. However,
despite these observations, the clinical relevance of niche remodeling under leukemic
conditions have been unclear until a systemic analysis on human AML patients’ bone
marrows by Kim et al. (Kim et al. Cancer Research, 2015, 75 (11) 2222-2231. Doi:
10.1158/0008-5472. CAN-14-3379). They revealed that human BMs of AML patients indeed
exhibited a cellular shift in mesenchymal niche characterized by the loss of mesenchymal
stromal cell (MSC) proliferation and loss of mesenchymal progenitors (CD146+,primitive
subsets of MSCs) along with extensive transcriptional reprogramming in MSCs.

Of note, during the reprogramming of mesenchymal niche, the expression of cross-talk
molecules (Jagged-1 or CXCL-12) in niche cell was reset in a manner that it can
distinctively regulate normal and malignant hematopoietic progenitors to selectively
suppress normal HSCs while sparing the leukemogenic activity of leukemia cells. Thus,
the mesenchymal niche altered by leukemic cells can contribute to clonal dominance of
leukemia cells over normal hematopoietic pool, leading to the loss of normal
hematopoietic function, a major cause of mortality under leukemic conditions. Thus,
leukemic niche established by leukemic cells should be an intrinsic process of
leukemogenesis that can self-reinforce the leukemic process.

Since the leukemic niche exerts a regulatory impact on normal and leukemic cells, one
interesting possibility is that it could be a factor that influences the heterogeneity
in the clinical course of leukemia patients. Strikingly, our recent study (Kim et al,
ibid) has revealed that the difference in the stromal pattern in
AML patients at the time of initial diagnosis is associated with different clinical
courses for subsequent 5-8 years after the initial treatment (illustrated in Fig. 1). Most BMs in AML patients who maintained
complete remission after the ini- tial treatment showed low levels of mesenchymal
components. However, BMs of those patients who experienced early (＜1 year) or
late (＞1 year) relapse exhibited higher levels of mesenchymal progenitors or
MSCs, respectively. Thus, BM findings at initial diagnosis can serve as a biomarker to
predict the clinical course of AML to identify high-risk patients. Since the
identification of risk for relapse has been of major interest for the management of
leukemia patients, various markers have been developed for unfavorable prognosis,
including cytogenetic abnormality and gene expression pattern of leukemic blasts. Thus,
predicting relapse by stromal pattern could provide new approaches for therapeutic
planning based on individual microenvironment.

Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of leukemia-induced alterations of niches and their
clinical significance. LSC clones developed in bone marrow can induce
transcriptional reprogramming of mesenchymal cells and the remodeling of the
niche towards a loss of M-progenitors and maturation into osteoblastic cells.
Altered niche can provide a distinctive cross-talk to normal HSCs and LSCs in a
manner that can selectively suppress normal HSCs (−) but maintain LSCs
(＋), leading to the dominance of leukemia cells over normal hematopoietic
cells. The difference in stromal remodeling at the initial diagnosis is
associated with heterogeneity in clinical prognosis after the treatment. Thus,
stromal remodeling as a parameter that can influence leukemogenic activity and
subsequent clinical course can serve as a prognostic marker in AML.
Collectively, microenvironment-based approaches to leukemia should open a horizon for
personalized and biology-based treatments towards more efficient leukemia treatment by
targeting specific niche conditions in each individual leukemogenic process.
