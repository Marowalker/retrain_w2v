familial Parkinson’s disease (PD). As such, functions and dysfunctions of LRRK2
in PD have been the subject of extensive investigation. In addition to PD,
increasing evidence is suggesting that LRRK2 is associated with a wide range of
diseases. Genome-wide association studies have implicated LRRK2 in Crohn’s
disease (CD) and leprosy, and the carriers with pathogenic mutations of LRRK2
show increased risk to develop particular types of cancer. LRRK2 mutations are
rarely found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but LRRK2 might play a part in
tauopathies. The association of LRRK2 with the pathogenesis of apparently
unrelated diseases remains enigmatic, but it might be related to the yet unknown
diverse functions of LRRK2. Here, we reviewed current knowledge on the link
between LRRK2 and several diseases, including PD, AD, CD, leprosy, and cancer,
and discussed the possibility of targeting LRRK2 in such diseases. [BMB Reports

Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)Parkinson's disease (PD)Alzheimer's disease (AD)Crohn's disease(CD)
==== Body
GENERAL BIOLOGY OF LRRK2
Implications from sequence analysis and homology modeling
In 2004, two independent research groups identified leucine-rich repeat kinase 2
(LRRK2) or dardarin as a causative gene for autosomal dominant familial
Parkinson’s disease (PD) in multiple ethic families (1, 2). LRRK2 gene
encodes a large protein of 2,527 amino acids with multiple functional domains,
including protein-protein binding domains such as ankyrin-like repeats,
leucine-rich repeats, and WD40 domains, and enzymatic domains such as Ras of
complex (ROC) GTPase domain, a carboxyl-terminal of Roc (COR) domain, and a
kinase domain. To date, physiological and pathological functions of LRRK2 are
mainly linked to its GTPase and kinase activities.

On the basis of in silico sequence analysis and homology
modeling, LRRK2 has been classified as a member of several protein subfamilies,
such as ROC-COR (ROCO), mixed-lineage kinase (MLK), and receptor-interacting
protein kinase (RIPK) families. On the basis of the well-defined cellular
functions of such families, it is possible to predict plausible physiological
and pathological functions of LRRK2. In mammals, the subfamily of ROCO,
containing both ROC and COR domains, consists of four members, three of which
are kinases, including LRRK2, its isoform LRRK1, and death-associated protein
kinase (DAPK) (2). DAPK, a
Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated serine/threonine kinase, is implicated
in the regulation of cell death, autophagy (3), cell adhesion and motility (4, 5), and inflammatory
responses (6,7). Loss of DAPK function was found in many primary cancer
cells and cell lines, and the tumor progression and metastasis were inversely
correlated with its expression (8). In
addition to the homology of the ROC-COR domains in LRRK2 and DAPK, both kinases
have been associated with the pathology of brain and neurodegenerative diseases.
As mentioned above, LRRK2 is a well-known PD gene, and
genomewide association studies showed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms in
DAPK1 are associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
(AD).

LRRK2 encodes a kinase domain with high sequence homology to the
MLK subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MAPKKK).
MAPKKK activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 proteins (9); and MLK-mediated activation of JNK has been associated with PD
pathology. In the postmortem brain of PD patients, phospho-JNK staining was
detected in neurons adjacent to midbrain neurons with Lewy bodies (10). An inhibitor of MLK, CEP-1347 was
under clinical trials for PD patients (11). CEP-1347 prevented JNK activation in neurons and showed
neuroprotection in a variety of PD and neurodegenerative models, but the drug
failed to show efficacy in clinical trials.

The kinase domain of LRRK2 is closely related to RIPKs, which have a role in the
recognition of damage-, pathogen-, or stress-associated signaling. RIPK family
consists of seven members, including LRRK1 and LRRK2 being designated as RIPK6
and RIPK7, respectively. RIPK1-5 proteins are related to immune signaling
pathways (12, 13). Extracellular pathogens are recognized by
leucine-rich repeat domains of nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain-containing proteins (NODs). NOD1 and NOD2 are components of the innate
immune system and are involved in sensing the presence of pathogens. Upon
pathogen recognition, NODs recruit RIPK, which triggers downstream signaling
through the activation of NF-κB, resulting in the production of
inflammatory cytokines. LRRK2 has also been implicated in inflammatory responses
downstream of Toll-like receptor (TLR), which functions as an extracellular
pathogen sensor, similar to NOD (14).
Moreover, LRRK2 is known to regulate NF-κB activity and the production of
cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in immune cells (15).

Implications from the expression and localization of LRRK2
LRRK2 is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, and it is most abundant in
the brain, the kidney, and the immune system. Expression of LRRK2 in various
tissues implies that LRRK2 might have diverse roles. To understand physiological
roles of LRRK2, several animal models have been developed. Studies from LRRK2
knock-out animals suggest that LRRK2 might play a part in synaptic transmission.
In Drosophila models, LRRK2 mutants have impaired synaptic
structures, such as synapse-overgrowth, expanded nerve terminal, and increased
number of synaptic boutons (16). Such
phenotypes are thought to result from dysfunction of protein synthesis,
mitochondria transport, and microtubule polymerization. In LRRK2 knock-out mice,
the number of mature spines is decreased and synaptic transmission is altered in
striatal projected neurons (17).

In addition to brain dysfunction, abnormal phenotypes were found in the kidneys
of LRRK2 knock-out mice (18-20). In the absence of LRRK2, aggregates
of α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins were detected in the kidney; and
autophagy-lysosomal pathway was also impaired, as indicated by the abnormal
accumulation of lipofuscin granules and altered levels of LC3-II and p62, which
are the markers for autophagy (18, 19). These studies suggest that LRRK2
might be involved in the regulation of protein homeostasis. It is unclear why
the autophagic defect was found specifically in the kidney, but the higher
expression level of LRRK2 in the kidney, possible compensation by LRRK1, the
different rate of basal autophagy in distinct tissues, or a combination of such
factors might provide an explanation.

LRRK2 is also highly expressed in immune cells, such as B-lymphocytes, monocytes,
dendritic cells, and macrophages (14,
15, 21, 22). In the peripheral
blood mononuclear cell population, LRRK2 is highly expressed in mature or
activated monocytes, and the inhibition of LRRK2 has been shown to block
monocyte maturation (21). Moreover,
expression of LRRK2 could be upregulated in response to IFN-γ and LPS in
monocytes and macrophages (14, 21, 22). These results suggest that LRRK2 might be involved in monocyte
maturation and innate immune responses.

LRRK2 IN HUMAN DISEASES
Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 are the most prevalent genetic cause
of PD, but growing evidence suggest that LRRK2 is implicated in
other seemingly unrelated human diseases, such as inflammatory diseases, leprosy,
and several types of cancer. However, the pathological functions of LRRK2 in such
diseases are unclear. The following sections describe current knowledge on the
linkage between LRRK2 and multiple human diseases, based on possible cellular
functions of LRRK2 including regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicle
trafficking, protein synthesis, protein homeostasis, autophagy, and
inflammation.

Parkinson’s disease
PD is the most popular neurodegenerative movement disorder characterized by
resting tremor, bradykinesia, posture instability, and rigidity. General
pathological features of PD include progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in
the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy Bodies (LBs), intraneuronal
abnormal protein deposits. Although etiology of PD is not clearly understood,
multiple genetic risk loci have been identified. Mutations in
LRRK2 are the most popular genetic cause of PD, accounting
for 4% of familial PD and 1% of sporadic PD across all populations. Carriers
with pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 possess typical, idiopathic
PD with few clinical differences from non-carrier patients, and they develop
various neuropathological features ranging from pure nigral degeneration without
LBs to nigral degeneration with LBs (in brain stem or widespread),
ubiquitin-positive inclusions or neurofibrillary tau-positive tangles (2, 23). Mutations in a single gene can bring about multiple
pathological consequences.

The pathological functions of LRRK2 have mainly been associated with aberrant
kinase activity. In general, high kinase activity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants
have been linked to pathological features of PD, such as dopaminergic neuronal
cell death, impaired dopamine neurotransmission and locomotive activity, defects
in protein synthesis and degradation, inflammatory responses, and oxidative
damage (24-27). Therefore, identifying physiological substrates of
LRRK2 kinase has been the subject of extensive investigation to provide
explanation for the disturbed cellular functions of LRRK2 as well as to develop
possible therapeutic interventions for the disease.

Synaptic dysfunction and aberrant kinase activity of LRRK2 have been reported in
several animal models of PD. Recently, a study has suggested a role for LRRK2 at
the synapse and provided evidence that endothilin A (EndoA) is a direct target
of LRRK2 kinase activity (28). EndoA is
a protein harboring a Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain that interacts with
membranes and induces membrane deformation. In a Drosophila
model, LRRK2 has been shown to affect synaptic transmission by phosphorylating
EndoA, and consequently, control membrane deformation and endocytosis of
synaptic membrane at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions.

LRRK2 has also been shown to phosphorylate eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E)-binding protein (4E-BP) and ribosomal protein S15 (RPS15). Evidence for
LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP and RPS15 raised the possibility that
LRRK2 might play a part in the regulation of protein synthesis (24, 29). LRRK2-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP dissociates 4E-BP from
eIF4E, and thereby increases free eIF4E available for initiation of translation.
It is plausible to suggest that increased and perhaps uncontrolled translation
increases toxicity. Phosphorylation of RPS15 stimulates both cap-dependent and
-independent mRNA translation, and thereby induces a bulk increase in protein
synthesis, which again might induce neural toxicity.

In addition to protein synthesis, LRRK2 has also been implicated in the
autophagy-lysosomal pathway. In animal and cell models of pathogenic LRRK2
mutants and in fibroblasts derived from PD patients with G2019S mutation,
ubiquitinated proteins were aberrantly increased and enlarged aggregates of
lysosomes were detected (30, 31). LRRK2 has also been shown to affect
Rab7-dependent perinuclear lysosome clustering and lysosomal degradation (32). In addition, evidence for
deregulation of autophagy has been provided by examining the brains of PD
patients. Markers for autophagy were altered and autophagic vacuoles were
accumulated in LRRK2 patient-derived cells (33). These lines of evidence suggest that impaired protein
synthesis and degradation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway might be
responsible for LRRK2 pathology.

Alzheimer’s disease
AD is the most common neurodegenerative disease showing progressive and
irreversible loss of memory and cognitive functions, ultimately leading to
dementia and death. General pathological features of AD include the presence of
amyloid β plaques and intraneuronal tangles of hyperphosphorylated forms of
microtubule-associated protein Tau. In general, clinical symptoms of PD and AD
are quite distinct, but PD and AD share some common pathological features, such
as abnormal protein deposits. More than 50 percent of AD patients have
α-synuclein-deposited LBs and tau deposits as in PD patients (34). Especially, α-synuclein is
involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The level of α-synuclein was increased
in the brain of AD patients as compared with age-matched control brains (35). In the early stages of AD,
α-synuclein is accumulated in presynaptic termini, implicating that
aberrant deposits might be involved in the early events of AD pathogenesis (36). Furthermore, LBs and Lewy neurites
are detected in the brains of AD patients (37). The expression analysis revealed that α-synuclein and
LRRK2 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the temporal cortex of LBs
variants of AD (LBV/AD) brains as compared with AD controls (38). Furthermore, α-synuclein
aggregation was increased in aged, LRRK2-null mice as compared with age-matched
control (18, 39); and α-synuclein-mediated cytotoxicity was
exacerbated in α-synuclein A53T and LRRK2 G2019S double transgenic mice as
compared to α-synuclein A53T mice (39). These results suggest that LRRK2 regulates
α-synuclein-mediated Lewy pathology in AD. Previous studies suggest that
LRRK2 might be involved in tauopathies, which include AD. Pathogenic mutants of
LRRK2, G2019S, and I2020T have been shown to directly phosphorylate Tau at
Thr181, depending on the association between LRRK2 and β-tubulin (40); and in LRRK2 R1441G transgenic mouse
brains, Tau phosphorylation was elevated (41). Increased Tau phosphorylation has also been detected in
postmortem brains of PD patients with LRRK2 mutation (2). Hyperphosphorylated Tau is a general pathological
feature of AD patients. Phosphorylated forms of Tau dissociate from tubulin and
preferentially self-aggregate to form intraneural tangle, which is associated
with neuronal toxicity and AD pathology. Despite the molecular and cellular
connections between proteins involved in AD pathology and LRRK2, LRRK2 mutations
are not common among AD patients. To date, pathogenic mutations of LRRK2 found
in PD have not been found in AD of various ethnic groups. A genome-wide
association (GWA) study failed to identify common genetic risk factors for PD
and AD (42). Thus, LRRK2 might not be a
direct genetic risk factor for AD, but LRRK2 appears to be connected with
several key proteins involved in AD pathology. LRRK2 might regulate protein
homeostasis through regulation of lysosomal and autophagy pathways in
neurodegenerative diseases, such as PD and AD.

Inflammatory bowel disease
GWA studies for Crohn’s disease (CD) and leprosy suggest possible association
between LRRK2 and inflammatory diseases (43, 44). (Leprosy
will be discussed in the following section.) CD is a chronic
inflammatory bowel disease caused by dysfunction of immune response to commensal
intestinal microbiota (45). Several
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LRRK2 loci were identified as risk
factors for CD (43). Moreover, LRRK2
mRNA level was highly increased in the inflamed biopsy sample, as compared to
non-inflamed control from the same patient with CD; and LRRK2 protein was
expressed in lamina propria macrophages, dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes
(15). In general, LRRK2 is highly
expressed in B lymphocytes, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Especially, LRRK2
has been implicated in monocyte maturation and in the production of inflammatory
cytokines during the course of innate immunity. A study analyzing the pattern of
LRRK2 expression in monocyte subpopulations has shown that LRRK2 expression is
higher in mature CD14+CD16+cells than in
CD14+CD16- monocytes (21). In addition, monocyte-maturing stimuli, such as IFN-γ,
serum free condition, and cold stress induced LRRK2 expression, and
pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2, by treating with small chemical inhibitors,
attenuated monocyte maturation induced by IFN-γ (21). Of note, IFN-γ is a key cytokine in immune
response and its concentration in plasma and intestinal mucosal are increased in
CD (46, 47).

A previous study using LRRK2-deficient mice has provided insights into the
pathological mechanism of LRRK2 in inflammatory bowel disease (48). LRRK2 negatively regulates NFAT1
activity by modulating its nuclear translocation. NFAT family comprises
transcription factors that regulate innate immune response in T lymphocytes,
macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils. With the accompanying defects in
NFAT signaling, LRRK2 deficient mice show hyperactive immune responses and
enhanced susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodiuminduced inflammatory bowel
disease. Notably, kinase activity of LRRK2 had no effect on NFAT1 activation. In
particular, the inflammatory bowel disease risk allele M2397 affected the
protein level of LRRK2, but had no effect on the kinase activity. Given that
LRRK2 dysfunction in PD is mainly associated with the aberrant kinase activity,
LRRK2 pathology in PD and inflammatory bowel disease might involve distinct
molecular players and cellular pathways.

Leprosy
Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium
leprae (M.leprae). Host immune responses and
several genetic factors have been suggested to influence the clinical spectrum
of and susceptibility to leprosy. Through GWA studies, significant associations
between leprosy and SNPs in the genes encoding histocompatibility complex class
II DR, RIPK2, tumor necrosis factor superfamily 15, C13orf31, and NOD2 have been
found, and a trend toward an association with SNPs in LRRK2 has been reported
(44). A previous study has provided
evidence that NOD2-mediated innate immune signaling is associated with the
pathology of leprosy. NOD2 functions as a pattern recognition receptor that
senses bacterial-cell-wall peptidoglycan and muramyl dipeptide motif (49). Upon ligand binding, NOD2 receptor
recruits RIPK2, a kinase which has high homology with LRRK2 in the kinase
domain. RIPK2 recruitment initiates intracellular signaling pathways, leading to
the activation of NF-κB signaling and induction of downstream target genes.
Mice lacking NOD2 or RIPK2 are highly susceptible to bacterial infection, owing
to defects in the production of inflammatory cytokines that activate T
lymphocytes. Exactly how LRRK2 is linked to the pathology of leprosy remains
unknown, but TLR signaling pathway is likely to be involved. Similar to NOD2
signaling pathways, TLR-mediated signaling is also linked to leprosy, and TLR1,
2, and 4 have genetic associations with leprosy. TLRs mediate pathogen sensing
during innate immune responses and TLR1, 2, and 6 are involved in M.
Leprae antigen recognition (50). Notably, TLR2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 agonists, which signal via
MYD88 pathway, enhance phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935, which is
thought to represent the activation status of LRRK2 kinase activity in
macrophages. However, NOD1 and NOD2 agonists failed to induce the
phosphorylation of LRRK2 (14).
Therefore, it is possible that LRRK2 is involved in the pathology of leprosy
through TLR-mediated inflammatory signaling pathways, but not through NOD
signaling. Together, these results suggest that specific inflammatory stimuli
and pathological conditions regulate LRRK2 activity and functions in multiple
immune diseases.

Cancer
Debate about the association between PD and cancer has a long history.
Epidemiological studies suggest that PD patients are less susceptible to develop
most types of cancers, but with some exceptions. However, since genetic factors
of PD have been identified, the premise of cancer susceptibility in PD patients
is changing. PD genes, such as α-synuclein,
Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, and
LRRK2 have been associated with particular types of cancer
(51). Parkin was
the first to be identified as a tumor suppressor gene among PD risk genes, and
loss-of-function mutations in Parkin were found in several
types of cancers. DJ-1 has been shown to down-regulate the
expression of a tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, and a high level
of DJ-1 was detected in various types of cancer. In several
epidemiological studies, the most prominent pathogenic mutant of LRRK2, G2019S
carriers showed increased incidence in nonskin cancers, hormone-related cancers,
and breast cancers (52-54). In papillary renal and thyroid
carcinomas, chromosomal amplification of LRRK2 was detected, and LRRK2
expression and receptor tyrosine kinase MET activity were highly correlated
(55). Furthermore, depletion of
LRRK2 disrupted the activation of MET and prevented tumor cell proliferation
(55). Precise role of LRRK2 in
cancer progression is yet to be defined, but a possible link might be found in
the regulation of protein translation. LRRK2 interacts with eIF4E and directly
phosphorylates 4E-BP. This eIF4E-4E-BP mediated protein translation controls a
subset of mRNAs, including transcription factors E2F and
DP, and phospho-4E-BP enhances their translation (56, 57). In mitotic and post-mitotic cells, E2F and DP heterodimerize
and control cell fate in a distinct fashion. In mitotic cells, up-regulation of
E2F-DP contributes to cancer progression by promoting cell proliferation,
whereas in post-mitotic neurons, E2F-DP induces death. Notably, LRRK2 has been
shown to negatively regulate the translational repression of E2F and DP through
antagonizing miRNAs, let-7 and miR-184,
respectively (56). Therefore, LRRK2
might have a role in cancer progression through the regulation of eIF4E-4E-BP
axis and miRNA-mediated protein translation. In addition to protein translation,
regulation of autophagy and cytoskeletal rearrangement could play a part in
LRRK2-mediated pathology in cancer.

CONCLUSION
Currently, it remains unclear how LRRK2 regulates the pathology of multiple,
seemingly unrelated human diseases. LRRK2 is genetically associated with several
diseases, implying that different mutations are associated with distinct pathology.
Mutations can alter enzymatic activities of LRRK2 or the ability of LRRK2 to
associate with its upstream regulators or downstream effectors. Indeed, pathogenic
mutations linked to PD and cancer alter the kinase or GTPase activity of LRRK2; and
accumulating lines of evidence suggest that enzymatic activities are critical to
disease progression. However, mutations associated with immune dysfunction have
little effect on the kinase activity of LRRK2, and the pathology is not linked to
its kinase activity. Therefore, each disease associated with LRRK2 might involve
distinct pathological mechanisms. To evaluate LRRK2 as a therapeutic target in
multiple diseases, it will be of importance to understand the functions and
signaling of LRRK2 in multiple diseases.
