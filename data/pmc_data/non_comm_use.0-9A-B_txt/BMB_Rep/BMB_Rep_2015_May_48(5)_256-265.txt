developed countries. Recently, target tissues derived from human embryonic stem
(hES) cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), such as cardiomyocytes
(CMs) or neurons, have been actively mobilized for drug screening. Knowledge of
drug toxicity and efficacy obtained using stem cell-derived tissues could
parallel that obtained from human trials. Furthermore, iPSC disease models could
be advantageous in the development of personalized medicine in various parts of
disease sectors. To obtain the maximum benefit from iPSCs in disease modeling,
researchers are now focusing on aging, maturation, and metabolism to
recapitulate the pathological features seen in patients. Compared to pediatric
disease modeling, adult-onset disease modeling with iPSCs requires proper
maturation for full manifestation of pathological features. Herein, the success
of iPSC technology, focusing on patient-specific drug treatment,
maturation-based disease modeling, and alternative approaches to compensate for
the current limitations of patient iPSC modeling, will be further discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Conventional disease modeling studies, using animal models and immortalized cell
systems, have been consistently used to study disease pathology and therapeutic
development (1). Artificially manipulated
cells have been used to screen therapies for monogenic diseases, such as cancer,
neurodegenerative diseases, and congenital heart disease (2). Although monogenic diseases have been actively studied to
identify cures, multiple mutations, as seen in compound-mutation diseases, have not
been analyzed for drug screening. It has been challenging to design disease models
that involve multiple genes and mimic most human diseases (1, 3). Interestingly,
95% of new drugs screened using artificially manipulated cells were withdrawn due to
off-target effects (4).

To alleviate the problems associated with off-target effects, studies using human
tissues have been suggested. However, studies using human samples pose some major
challenges. First, it is difficult to obtain fresh human disease samples. Second, it
is not possible to critically observe the development of pathological features,
since most of the human samples are obtained from the end stages of the disease or
postmortem. Hence, human iPSC disease modeling has emerged as an alternative
modeling method for obtaining both important human pathology data and unlimited
resources. Since 2008, there has been rapid development of iPSC-mediated disease
modeling and novel therapy options (5)
(Table 1). Human iPSC disease modeling
has key advantages compared to its predecessors. For example, it provides a
complicated genetic signature of human tissue and an unlimited resource for
identifying the mechanism underlying pathology development and for developing novel
cures.

In this review, I have discussed the success obtained with congenital and sporadic
disease modeling using iPSCs for representative diseases. Furthermore, the
importance of tissue-specific maturation in disease modeling has been discussed.
Last, the importance of hES- and iPSC-based drug screening in cardiology,
collectively human cell-based screening, has been addressed with respect to reducing
unwanted toxicity issues and obtaining an amenable outcome for new therapies.

OVERVIEW OF iPSC
There has been massive interest in the application of iPSCs since studies by Dr.
Yamanaka first reported mouse and human iPSC generation (6, 7). The
LIF-dependent mouse iPSC and bFGF-based human iPSC cultures differed from each
other, but their basis for transformation was identical (6, 7). For example,
Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (Yamanaka factors) were used as transforming factors
in both cases. Initially, a retrovirus was used to generate iPSCs. Later, inducible
lentiviruses, mRNAs, DNA episomes, peptides, and non-integrating viruses, such as
the Sendai virus, were developed to generate iPSCs (8).

Both ethical and translational obstacles in hES cell-based human therapies were
overcome by Yamanaka’s iPSC technology. The potential to generate many types
of vital tissues and cells, such as hematopoietic stem cells, heart muscles, and
motor neurons, brought worldwide attention to the potential of this patient-specific
cell-based therapy (9).

Researchers envision the use of iPSCs in two main ways: as a source for cell-based
therapy without immune rejection (9) and as
a tool for disease modeling to identify patient-specific cures (5). In this review, successful cases of iPSC disease modeling
have been presented, and suggestions for drug screening on the basis of stem
cell-based tests have been discussed.

DIFFERENTIATION OF CARDIAC MUSCLE FROM iPSCs
Initial stem cell-based CM differentiation was influenced by early frog embryonic
development. During gastrulation, the embryo differentiates into three layers, which
further develop as the endoderm, ectoderm and mesoderm (10). Early endoderm and mesoderm induction is influenced by
Nodal, which is a family member of Wnt and TGF-β. Endodermal influence on
cardiac differentiation was confirmed by artificially adding endoderm into the
early-stage embryo to induce ectopic heart tissue formation (11).

By mimicking early embryonic development, a three-dimensional embryonic body (3D EB)
with serum-mediated spontaneous cardiac differentiation was obtained; this has been
well documented (12). Moreover, adding
endodermal lineage cells (END-2 co-culture) with early differentiating hES cells
increased the efficiency of heart muscle differentiation up to ∼50% compared
to the ∼20% efficiency obtained with the spontaneous 3D EB method (13). In 2008, Keller’s group reported
the involvement of BMP4 and DKK/Wnt signaling (14) in the induction of cardiac muscle with defined media. In addition,
Kamp’s group demonstrated robust CHIR99201/IWP4-mediated Wnt/β-catenin
regulation, with up to 98% cardiac muscle generation from hES cells and iPSCs (15).

SUCCESSFUL PEDIATRIC CARDIAC DISEASE MODELING
Long QT (LQT)
LQT syndrome is one of the cardiac diseases that were initially studied
extensively using iPSCs. A series of LQT1, LQT2, and LQT8 iPSC models has been
reported since late 2010 and 2011 (16-18). LQT has 12
different subsets of categories depending on the mutations and phenotypes (19). In all three early models of LQT
iPSCs, clinically available regimens, as well as novel proof-of-concept options,
were tested in vitro. However, regimen usage and therapeutic
efficacy trials in living patients were not reported. Recently, iPSC disease
modeling was successfully used in relation to a therapeutic regimen in the
clinic for an LQT3 patient with compound mutations (20).

Conventional treatment of LQT3 involves blocking an abnormally activated
Na+ current (19, 21). When the Na+ channel
blockers mexiletine and flecanide were used to block the Na+ current,
delayed repolarization and a reduced prolonged QT interval was seen in the LQT
patient (21). A study reported that the
patient did not respond to any available clinical regimens before the study had
begun (20); however, by increasing the
beating frequency, it was observed that inactivation of the Na+
current increased and the proarrhythmic activity decreased. Furthermore, this
study confirmed that an iPSC-mediated therapeutic regimen was also successful
with a living patient (20).

ADULT ONSET CARDIAC DISEASE MODELING
LEOPARD syndrome
The first success in iPSC disease modeling in adult-heart disease was Leopard
syndrome (22). As shown in adult heart
hypertrophy, iPSC-derived CM of Leopard syndrome became bigger compared to the
control CMs. Within 30 days of cell culture in regular cardiogenic media, the
patient’s CM became notably bigger and more hypertrophic. This was a great
success in adult-onset disease, which allowed for the study of a devastating
human adult-heart disease in a much shorter time frame. In addition, from the
pathology development standpoint of view, it brought the researchers’
interest in adult onset disease modeling. It was a dramatic hypertrophic feature
for the Leopard syndrome iPSC CM within 30 days in culture, since patients
typically develop the disease pathology in their late 40s.

Hypertrophy
Lan et al. reported reprogramming modeling with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy patient-derived iPSC (23). In this study, they could not find any pathological behavior while
growing regular cardiogenic culture with 3D EB forms. When singlet culture of CM
was performed in indefinite stiffness plate, it revealed abnormal
Ca2+ transients and arrhythmic activity, revealing delayed after
depolarization (DAD) (23). Their finding
brought important insight of arrhythmia disease community to accelerate adult
onset disease in a dish. The residing mechanism of singlet-cultures in a dish
induced hypertrophic response would be resourceful.

MORE DISEASE MODELING USING iPSCs
EARLY SUCCESS OF DISEASE MODELING USING iPSC: NEURONAL DISEASE
It is worthwhile to mention the early success history of disease modeling, such as
neuronal disease, since the first suggestion of iPSC disease modeling was based on
neurodegenerative disease (5). Neuronal
differentiation is one of the initially differentiated target-tissue from various
sources of stem cells, such as hES, hiPSC, and somatic stem cells (24). Three major protocols have been
mobilized to generate neurons, such as 3D EB based spontaneous method without serum,
co-culture based method, and direct-induction of neurons with various chemicals and
growth factors method (24-27). Due to future therapeutic usage, various
attempts to induce neurons form hES and hiPSC have been made. Upon neuronal-rosette
formation after short EB-based serum free induction, CNS neurons mostly resided
within rosette, and migrating PNS neurons (descendant of neural crest cells) could
be separated based on their developmental property. Moreover, by adding inhibitors
of TGF and BMP signaling, researchers have obtained enhanced efficiency of neuronal
induction (27). Proper subtype
neuronal-lineage differentiation from iPSCs has allowed researchers to decipher
various pathological features to find potential cures.

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)
AD iPSC modeling is one of the most actively studied neurological disorders using
iPSCs (28-30). AD is an adult-onset disease, and the underlying
pathology development is not well understood. Less than 10% of the patients have
familial mutations, such as Presenilin-1 (PS1), Presenilin-2 (PS2), and Amyloid
Precursor Protein (APP) (Table 1).

Recently, researchers found that iPSC-derived neurons from different patients
showed different pathophysiology of AD, especially in the accumulation of
Aβ oligomers (28, 31). Aβ-oligomer-accumulation is one
of the hallmarks of AD development. This indicates the unsolved mechanism of
Aβ oligomers behavior in AD patients. Israel et al.
reported that only one sporadic AD patient iPSC neuron presented accumulation of
Aβ oligomers (31). In both the
Kondo et al. and Israel et al. reports, Aβ-oligomer accumulating neurons
from individual iPSC showed increased ER-stress and cell damages due to
increased reactive-oxygen-species (ROS). Although Aβ-oligomer-accumulation
is not correlated with the patients’ genetic background, treatment for
those affected neurons can be predicted through iPSC modeling. Furthermore,
those iPSC-derived neuron data were well correlated with the patient’s
regimen-data, such as DHA treatment to ameliorate ROS-mediated cell damage. AD
patient iPSC-derived neuron can be a good therapeutic testing ground to find the
patient’s optimal pharmacological regimen.

Schizophrenia (SCZD)
Schizophrenia (SCZD) study by Brennand et al. is one of the hallmark studies for
genetically unidentified patient cases using iPSC disease modeling. In their
study, they combined the data from a child-onset SCZD patient (6 year old) and 3
adult-onset SCZD patients (32). They
found that genetically unknown SCZD patient samples had similar pathological
signature. Both types of patients showed reduced neuritis number,
postsynaptic-protein-95 (PSD95) expressions, and glutamate receptor expressions.
They suggested that SCZD might share different pathological mechanisms. One
candidate is the altered developmental signaling, such as Notch and Wnt
signaling. It could be interpreted to have a common prevention method of SCZD
among genetically-un-known SCZD patients.

More iPSC-based neuronal disorders studies have been reported in genetically
identified cases. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy
(SMA), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington disease (HD), Rett Syndrome
(RTT), and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are on going subjects of therapeutic
screen (33-47).

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
Multiple groups reported ALS iPSC disease modeling (48, 49). Two
recent reports used Superoxide-Dismutase-1 (SOD1) mutated patient fibroblast,
which covers 20% of familial ALS cases, to generate iPSC. Kiskinis et
al. performed high resolution RNA seq from
SOD1+/A4V dominant mutation
iPSC and ZFN-mediated isogenic control iPSC-derived MNs to narrow down the
pathogenic mechanism (48). The authors
found that motor neurons (MNs) from
SOD1+/A4V dominant-mutation
iPSC showed that the expressions of mitochondrial-related and ER-stress-mediated
genes were reduced. Their genetic analysis was confirmed by mitochondrial
behavior analysis and ER stress response. Furthermore, the pathogenic feature of
SOD1+/A4V ALS patient iPSC MNs
was found to be conserved in different genetic background, such as the GGGGCC
repeat expansions in C9orf72 locus patients’ iPSC MNs.

Chen et al. found the autonomous behavior of mutated SOD1 in
MNs, but not in non-MNs (49). Only in
MNs, mutated SOD1+/D90A was found
to bind to the 3’UTR region of neurofilament (NF)-L mRNA and interfere
with the association of NF with NF-H and NF-M, resulting in NF aggregations in
MNs. By restoring NF-L expression, mutated
SOD1+/D90A iPSC MNs
mitigated neurite degeneration. Further elucidating the ALS pathogenic mechanism
by those efforts could potentially bring a novel cure for these patients.

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
SMA is also a MN disease, which showed elevated MN death. Survival-motor-neuron-1
(SMN1) gene mutation causes SMA (44,
46). Sareen et al.
reported that SMA patient iPSC MNs showed elevated cell death, which was
accompanied with prolonged activation of caspase 3. By blocking apoptosis, they
were able to improve the neurological feature of SMA MNs, indicating common
treatment options for SMA.

Corti et al. introduced a different approach to SMA treatment.
SMA pathology is due to homozygous mutation in SMN1; however, most patients have
normal SMN2. One of the therapeutic concepts to SMA was increasing SMN1-like
proteins in patient-motor neurons. If SMA patient cells were treated with VPA or
tobramycin, then the intrinsic SMN2 stop codon can be bypassed to make SMN1-like
products (50). In addition, treatment
with a GSK3-kinase inhibitor in ES-derived MNs showed significant increase of
SMN, indicating plausible outcome for future human SMA treatment (51). But, Cori et al.
provided gene-edited SMN2 to mimic SMN1 in patient iPSC MNs. Their
proof-of-concept trials with the gene-edited MNs transplant rescued the SMA
mutant mice (46).

Huntington disease (HD)
HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a
cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeats in the first exon of Huntington (HTT)
gene. Several HD iPSCs disease modeling were reported with
deepened-understanding of HD pathology development, such as mitochondria
fragmentation and BDNF dependency for survival (34, 36, 47). Recently,
mitochondria-fragmentations-blocker treatment and BNDF over-activation through
RE-1-silencing-transcription factor (REST) regulation showed alleviated disease
pathology (52, 53). Those efforts could potentially bring therapeutic
benefit to many patients suffering from HD, which has no cure so far.

Rett Syndrome (RTT)
Rett syndrome (RTT) patients suffer devastating neurodevelopmental delay, mostly
in females (41). RTT is caused by a
mutation in methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2), which is highly expressed in
mature neurons and glia (37). iPSC
disease modeling on RTT has been reported. Furthermore, recent progress in MECP2
and IGF1 correlation could potentially bring about therapy for RTT patients
(37, 40). For instance, Williams et al. rescued RTT patient
iPSC-derived neurons with either IGF1 or GPE (a peptide with first 3 amino acids
of IGF1) treatment, indicating future therapeutic options for RTT (37).

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)
PWS is a disease of genetic-imprinting, especially in paternal chromosome
15q11-q13 region (39). Also, large
deletion of the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 during meiosis induces PWS (43). PWS patients suffer from
neurological disorder and early-child-hood obesity. Recent generation of PWS
iPSC may facilitate therapeutic suggestion for the patients, since no mice model
reproduces the whole feature of PWS (43).

EVOLVING CONCEPT OF iPSC DISEASE MODELING
Maturation-based disease modeling
Recently, two reports have been published regarding maturation-based adult on-set
disease modeling: one was on Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the other on the
cardiac disease arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy
(ARVD/C) (54, 55).

Progerin-based maturation in PD modeling
PD is one of the highly studied iPSC disease models and one of the most common
neurodegenerative diseases in ageing populations (47, 54, 56). In PD, increased cell death is seen
in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) with complicated genetic stress, such as mutations
in α-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), PTEN-induced
putative kinase 1 (PINK), and parkin, as well as with environmental stress.

However, late-onset disease models using iPSCs often show incomplete penetrated
pathology from patient iPSC-derived target tissues. Aged cells showed loss of
the heterochromatin markers trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) and
heterochromatinprotein-1γ (HP1γ), but they became rejuvenated during
iPSC transformation. It is often difficult to find pathological differences in
embryonic stage patient iPSC DNs, considering their naïve neuronal stage.
Miller et al. combined progerin, the protein associated with
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), with PINK1-Q456X- and
Parkin-V324A-mutated iPSCs to manifest robust PD pathology in
vitro
(54). In progeria, the lamin A in the
nuclear membrane has a defect and accumulates in aged or HGPS patients. By
ectopically inducing a progerin peptide in patient iPSC derived DNs, they
detected robust pathological phenomena, such as loss of dendrites and increased
cell death.

Metabolic maturation-based disease modeling
Recently, we analyzed patient-derived iPSC disease models in ARVD/C with
metabolic maturation and noted adult-onset pathophysiological features (55). ARVD/C is an inherited
cardiomyopathy that can cause sudden-cardiac-death in young adults, and a
majority of these patients have the desmosome mutation (55). iPSCs from the fibroblasts of an ARVD/C patient with
a homozygous c.2484C>T mutation in plakophilin-2 (PKP2) were established.
Surprisingly, ARVD/C patient-derived iPSC CMs initially did not show significant
abnormalities, such as cell death or lipid accumulation (55).

As cardiac muscle matures, energy metabolism switches from glucose-based
non-aerobic ATP generation to aerobic and fatty acid-based β-oxidation
(57). During postnatal development,
the main hormones (e.g., insulin, adrenalin, and thyroid hormone) and
cholesterol provide essential cues for the proper maturation and development of
various organs. Cardiac energy metabolism shifts from glycolysis-based to
lipid-based oxidation with the induction of three factors, that is, insulin,
adrenalin, and cholesterol (55). Ectopic
activation of PPAR-gamma (PPARγ) was observed in the heart of an ARVD/C
patient (58). By inducing PPARγ, in
addition to three factor-mediated metabolic maturation, we manifested
pathological phenotypes of ARVD/C hearts within ∼60 days in culture (55). Simple PPARγ over-activation
without presetting metabolically matured hES/patient iPSC-derived CMs did not
induce pathological development, indicating that maturation was a prerequisite
for the development of adult pathology.

Tissue culture stiffness on proper maturation
Tissue culture stiffness is a crucial factor that affects cell biology and
physiology during stem cell differentiation in many tissues, such as pancreatic
cells, osteoblast differentiation, and CMs (59). Studies with neonatal rat CMs showed that indefinite stiffness
disrupted the regular heart-beat, even after a short period in culture (60). Human tissues, such as heart
tissues, provide stiffness (approximately 10-17 kPa) to individual cardiac
muscles, which supports normal beating and growth of the muscle (60, 61). To verify abnormal behaviors in LEOPARD syndrome, further
correlation studies using hypertrophic iPSC-derived CMs, and tissue culture
stiffness, which are important for abnormal growth and activity of tissues, may
provide a valuable adult-onset iPSC disease modeling platform (22, 23).

ADVANTAGES OF USING STEM CELL-DERIVED TISSUES FOR FUTURE DRUG SCREENING
Screening drugs using iPSCs has major advantages over immortalized cell- or small
animal-based screening methods, since it provides patient-specific efficacy.
Efficacy and toxicity can be studied using human-derived iPSCs to minimize unwanted
side effects. Furthermore, knowledge gained from iPSC disease models can provide new
therapeutic options for complicated human diseases involving multiple genes, which
cannot be applied with conventional disease modeling. There have been a handful of
successful drug testing and efficacy trials using iPSCs in recent reports.

Novel drug candidate screen for hepatic disorders
Choi et al. recently used iPSCs from patients with alpha
antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency to drive hepatocytes and to screen 3131 compounds
and reported novel drug candidates for hepatic disorders (62). The most common AAT deficiency was due to a point
mutation in the AAT gene, which induced spontaneous polymerization, ER protein
overload in hepatocytes, and liver disorders. They found five candidates that
decreased the accumulation of the mutant form of AAT in cells; all these
candidates have been approved by the FDA for different diseases. Interestingly,
one of their candidates, carbamazepine (CBZ), showed great efficacy in reducing
hepatic fibrosis in the AAT mouse model, indicating the durability and efficacy
of iPSC-based drug screening (63).

Loxapine for SCZD
The cause of SCZD is not known and treatment results for patients are variable.
One interesting result from the Brennand et al. study provided
important insights into the molecular basis of antipsychotic drugs, such as
clozapine, loxapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and thioridazine, with SCZD iPSC
neurons (32). Interestingly, one of the
candidate drugs, loxapine, increased neuritis and the connectivity between
neurons, explaining a possible therapeutic mechanism for SCZD. Although their
studies were limited to a small number of patient iPSC lines, this human disease
iPSC model allowed for the discovery of optimized treatment options for a group
of patients with genetically unidentified disease.

Kenpaullone for ALS
Using stem cell-derived MNs, researchers have tried to identify substances
related to MN-specific survival (64).
Recently, Yang and colleagues reported a novel therapeutic regimen for ALS,
using SOD1 mouse ES MNs and human ALS patient iPSC-derived MNs (65). Kenpaullone was one of the
candidates that increased the survival of SOD1 mouse-derived MNs, and its
efficacy was tested in human SOD1 iPSC-derived MNs. Although their initial
screen was not based on iPSC MNs from ALS patients, it clearly proved to be a
successful beginning for drug screening in ALS.

Human iPSC-based therapeutic safety consideration
Cardiac toxicity is an imminent factor for newly developed drugs. Recently, many
newly developed and even market-available drugs have been retracted due to
cardiac sudden death with QT interval increase and tachycardia-based arrhythmia
attack, mostly resembling cardiac LQT syndrome. For example in 1996, an anti
histamine drug, Seldane, was retracted from the market after it was attributed
to 98 death cases in the United States. In addition, in early 2000 more than 8
non-cardiac post-market drugs were retracted due to severe cardio toxicity (66).

Conventional cardiac toxicity test has been performed with immortalized CHO cell
based IC50 human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG=
Ikr, rapid component inward rectifying
K+ current) activity test for possible QT interval elongation
(66, 67). Anti-HERG activity from unsafe drugs is the major
cause of cardiac arrest and arrhythmia (68). QT interval elongation is the key cardiac toxicity criteria in
newly invented drugs for human trials (66), and it is an important indicator for imminent threat to
patients. QT interval is the time between Q and T waves during cardiac beating,
and it is called electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. QT can be generally
explained as the ventricular action-potential-duration (APD), such as beginning
of pump in and end of pump out in the ventricle.

Many researchers suspect that the cause of cardio toxicity problem in newly
developed non-cardiac drugs is due to immortalized cell based drug toxicity
screen, since those cells accumulate mutations and are immune to newly developed
drug-induced toxicity (69).
Pharmaceutical companies often waste valuable resources due to adverse outcome
of toxicity problem. In fact, the cost of QT interval toxicity check has been
attributed to about 22% of the cost in phase 1 human trials in United States
(67). These cases show the
importance of human-oriented toxicity test. To avoid non-physiological drug
candidates screen from immortalized cells with single protein over-expression
setting, researchers tried human tissues, such as human heart muscle tissues, to
test novel drugs.

However, it is very difficult to obtain fresh samples from patients. More often,
those samples are not useful due to sample preparation errors. Liang and
colleagues’ recent report (69)
revealed two major findings in stem cell-based toxicity studies and iPSC-based
novel therapy screen. They found that the sensitivity of
Ikr K+ current inhibitions among
various pro-arrhythmogenic drugs was more reliable in hES/iPSC-derived CM,
rather than in hERG-expressing CHO or 293 cell lines. They showed that hERG
blockage from a market-available safe drug, verapamil, was observed in a 293
cell-based toxicity study, whereas cardiac toxic Alfuzocin did not show severe
toxicity in the same setting (69). In
other words, safe drugs could be dismissed and dangerous drugs replaced, if
researchers did not use hES/iPSC-derived CM for toxicity test. In human heart
muscle, hundreds of ion channels are expressed and orchestrated. Only human
ES/iPSC-derived CM faithfully mimics the milieu of human ion channels in the
human heart (70).

It could be a perfect drug screening system if it can solve the drug efficacy and
safety issues with the same cell-based platform. Patient iPSC-derived target
tissue-based drug screening answers both needs and gives us better opportunity
to find therapy (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Schematic view of novel hES/iPSC-derived CM-based human cardiac
toxicity test. Ikr (rapid component of
inward rectifying K+ current, hERG) is the major category to
correlate possible human cardio toxicity. Decrease of hERG by drugs
indicating the increase of QT interval by drugs, which induce severe
cardiotoxic event.
LIMITATION OF iPSC-MEDIATED DISEASE MODELING AND RECENT PROGRESS
One of major criticisms of iPSC disease modeling is the limited numbers of comparison
groups (71). Two alternative methods can
solve this potential limitation of iPSC disease modeling; One is the gene
editing-mediated disease modeling by inducing mutation in normal iPSC, and the other
is the direct conversion from somatic source of patient samples to target tissues,
such as neuron or CM.

Gene editing-based disease modeling
For human patient-derived iPSC generation, human internal review board (IRB)
approval often delays or even completely blocks the study progress. Furthermore,
genetically affected human tissues are very difficult to obtain for
statistically significant studies. If researchers can make mutated stem cells in
their own laboratory, using available normal hESs/hiPSCs, then robust studies
can be conducted. There has been a movement to generate allele specific patient
iPSC lines without the original samples from the patients (72). Gene editing technology provides various options to
fix or mutate certain gene or genes without tracing exogenous genome. Currently,
RNA-guided-engineered-nuclease (RGENs, derived from
clustered-regularly-interspaced-short-palindromic-repeat (CRISPR)-Cas),
zincfinger-nuclease (ZFN), and transcription-activator-like-effectornuclease
(TALEN)-based disease modeling are widely utilized (73, 74).

However, gene-edited hES/iPSC may not reproduce full-blown human pathology as
patient sample-derived iPSC. Disease pathology often pre-requires the
patients’ life styles and complicated genetic modifiers, which only
patient-derived iPSC could provide. Gene editing-mediated disease modeling from
various academic institutes should be studied together with disease causing
modifiers in order to make fully recapitulating human disease modeling.

Direct conversions-based disease modeling
Direct conversion is also much faster than conventional iPSCs, which require
labor- and time-intensive generation/ characterization/ tests. We can avoid
these numerical issues with direct tissue conversion methods. Direct conversions
from patient fibroblast to neurons have been reported recently (75). Currently, more researchers would
like to use human-induced neurons (hiNs)-mediated neurological disease modeling,
instead of generating hiPSCs, since there are advantages to using hiNs over
hiPSC (75). First, we can increase the
sample numbers from a few iPSC lines to a few thousand of hiNs. Second we can
focus disease studies only rather than stem cell study. Cardiac disease also
became the follower to use direct conversion as tools to study disease (76, 77). However, there may be unnecessary stress during direct
conversion from human patient samples, and it needs to be redirected to the
disease modeling. Direct conversion can be the next solution for disease
modeling, as long as the conversion process does not put unnecessary stress to
the cells or cause unexpected molecular diversion, which could interfere with
tissue identity and pathological development.

CONCLUSION
iPSCs are being used to develop patient-specific therapies and their use has been
successful for many diseases. These patient-specific medical regimens have been
considered quite successful. Compared to the success of the pediatric disease model,
adult-onset disease modeling faces hurdles and challenges such as disease
recapitulation and relevant therapy test issues (71). However, the recent success in adult-onset disease in ARVD/C and
PD cases can be models for the ongoing iPSC-derived disease modeling community (54, 55, 78).

The key steps to identifying novel therapies include both generating target tissues
from patient iPSCs and obtaining mature adult-like tissues. In addition to
maturation setting, we can test novel pathophysiological approaches for generating
patient-specific medicine. Studies involving international collaboration and
increased numbers of patient samples and iPSC quality controls would greatly
facilitate the development of novel therapies (Fig.
2). Furthermore, a combination of direct conversion-based disease models,
such as hiN from patient tissue or gene editing-based mutation introduction, can
strengthen the potential of stem cell-based disease modeling. We expect an
unprecedented amount of important evidence to accumulate in the search for the cure
for diseases.

Fig. 2. Human patients and patient gene edited iPSC/hES-mediated novel therapy
development. Disease containing stem cells were differentiated into target
tissue such as neurons and CM. Adult-stage-maturated target tissue will be
used to screen novel therapeutic candidates or market-available drugs to
find right dosage for individual patients. Novel drugs’ cardiotoxicity
test will be performed while optimizing the efficacy of target hit.
Optimized therapy will be pursued to live human patients.
