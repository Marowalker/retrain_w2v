INTRODUCTION
The N-end rule pathway is one of the substrate recognition mechanisms in the
ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which links physiological half-life of a target
protein to its N-terminal residue. In the arginylation branch of the N-end rule
pathway (Arg/N-end rule pathway), the proteins bearing both a destabilizing
N-terminal amino acid and a sterically accessible internal Lys residue(s)
(collectively called an N-degron) are generally short-lived (1-3). In mammals,
Arg, one of the primary destabilizing residues, can be attached to N-terminal Asp,
Glu, or oxidized Cys by ATE1-encoded Arg-tRNA-protein transferase
(Arg-transferase) (4). The newly attached
N-terminal Arg residue is recognized and ubiquitinated by a family of E3 ubiquitin
ligases named UBR1 through UBR7 (5, 6). The Arg/N-end rule pathway is present even
in prokaryotes, which lack ubiquitin (7-9), probably indicating that
the N-end rule pathway developed evolutionarily prior to the UPS.

The N-terminal arginylation mediated by ATE1 Argtransferase was identified ∼50 years
ago as one of eukaryotic posttranslational modifications (10) and relatively recently was found to play important roles
in the control of the half-life of various proteins in the cell. In mammals, two
independent papers reported in 2005 that the R4 subfamily of proteins–regulators of
G protein signaling (RGS: RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16) are targeted via the ATE1-UBR
circuit, and their degradation depends on nitric oxide (NO) and molecular oxygen
concentration (11, 12), which oxidize the N-terminal Cys exposed after cleavage
of N-terminal Met by MetAPs. More recently, it was reported that wild-type RGS2,
another R4 subfamily member, has a Gln-2 residue, which is frequently mutated in
hypertensive patients to Leu or Arg (13).
These mutant RGS2 proteins are processed by either the Arg/N-end rule pathway or the
Ac/N-end rule pathway. These findings indicate that the two branches of the N-end
rule pathway can functionally cooperate and consequently may have a more diverse
repertoire of substrate regulation mechanisms.

ATE1 Arg-transferase, the key enzyme in the Arg/N-end rule pathway, is an
evolutionarily conserved protein present in all eukaryotes from fungi to animals
(14). S. cerevisiae mutants lacking
ATE1-encoded Arg-transferase are phenotypically normal (15), whereas ATE1-null mice
die at a later stage of embryogenesis (approximately between embryonic day 14.5
[E14.5] and E15.5) due to cardiovascular defects, which resembles various human
congenital heart diseases such as ventricular hypoplasia and ventricular septal
defects (16). Recently, we reported that the
molecular mechanism underlying the characteristic congenital heart disease features
of ATE1−/− mice might be related to the cell-autonomous
proliferation defects of cardiomyocytes (17). During those studies, however, we frequently observed various gross
defects of neurons as well, such as malformation of the brain and cerebral
hemorrhages, but their origin and identity were elusive.

In the present study, we demonstrated that in ATE1-null murine
embryos, neural-tube genesis is severely defective, and this problem may be the
primary cause of embryonic mortality of the mutant mice. ATE1 expression was more
prominent in the embryonic brain and spinal cord than in the heart: this pattern
overlapped with the migratory path of neural crest cells. Moreover, the
ATE1-null embryonic brain showed stabilized RGS proteins,
defective G protein signaling, and a higher concentration of NO. Consistent with
these biochemical observations, proliferation of
ATE1−/− neuroepithelial cells in the
developing primary neural tube was significantly impaired. Taken together, our
results suggest that the crucial role of ATE1 in neural tube development may be
related to the proper turnover of the RGS4 protein instead of secondary events of
blood vessel malformation; the Arg/N-end rule pathway may function as an oxygen
sensor and free-radical scavenger.

RESULTS
Midgestation death and neural abnormality of
ATE1−/− mice
Genotyping of litter embryos at E14.5 retrieved from the
ATE＋/− intercross revealed no live
homozygous mutants (Fig. 1A), indicating that the deletion of the
ATE1 gene was lethal at midgestation. To examine the timing
and pathological nature of the embryonic death of
ATE1−/− mice, we dissected
morphological characteristics of the embryos produced by timed intercrosses
between ATE1＋/− individuals at various
stages: from E11.5 to E14.5 (Fig. 1B).
ATE1−/− embryos at the stages up to
E12.5 were recovered without noticeable morphological or physiological
abnormalities. In contrast, ATE1−/−
embryos on E13.5 were distinguishable from their wild-type or heterozygous
littermates. Their growth was significantly delayed (∼70% to 85% of that
in wild-type littermates), and approximately a half of them developed local
hemorrhages in lateral ventricles (Fig.
1C). Surviving ATE1−/− embryos
was arrested in size at ∼E13.5 and showed severe pericardial blood
leakage; this problem may be the proximal cause of death.
ATE1＋/− mutants did not show any
apparent phenotypes, and no gross abnormalities of other major organs were
observed.

Kidney slices at E13.5 (f, g) showed no noticeable difference between
wild-type and ATE1−/− murine
embryos.
Because of unexpected defects in ATE1−/−
embryonic brains, we examined histological features of the developing neural
tubes from E11.5 to E13.5 by H&E staining (Fig. 1D). Serial histological sections of E11.5 embryos revealed a
normally developing brain and spinal cord. In contrast, at E12.5, while
notochord, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and intermediate layers appeared to be
normal, ATE1−/− embryos manifested
abnormal morphological characteristics such as enlarged cystic space between the
spinal cord and the cartilage primordium (Fig.
1D, panels a & b). The morphological difference was more evident
at E13.5 (c & d), when no significant changes were observed in other organs
such as kidneys (e & f). In mouse embryos, branched nerves start to regulate
heart contractions at E12.5; this phenomenon may be linked to our observation
that embryonic death occurs at no earlier than ∼E12.5. Taken together, our
results indicate that the lethality of nullification of the
ATE1 gene may be mediated by a neuronal abnormality
starting at ∼E12.5.

Expression of LacZ from the targeted ATE1 allele in the central nervous
system (CNS)
Expression of a LacZ reporter which is integrated in the ATE1
allele was prominent in the brain and neural tube judging by
β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2A),
which was consistent with ATE1 mRNA expression from in
situ hybridization analysis (16). We also examined expression of ATE1 in histological slices
using the anti-RGS4 antibody (Fig. 2B).
The RGS4 protein is extremely short-lived in the wild-type background but is
stabilized in ATE1-null animals. Therefore,
ATE1−/− mice can serve as a rare
experimental model for monitoring the RGS4 expression. At E11.5, when the neural
folds still had not closed, the RGS4 protein was expressed at the boundary
between the non-neural ectoderm and neural plates (Fig. 2B). As the embryo grew, the RGS4-positive cells
migrated ventrally and cranially into the DRG, notochord, and sympathetic
ganglia, which are also the destinations of migrating neural crest cells. This
finding suggests that degradation of the RGS4 protein by ATE1 is closely
associated with the migration or differentiation of neural crest cells during
embryogenesis. In addition, because neural crest cells migrate into the heart
and vessels, it is possible that impaired migration of neural crest cells may
lead to the cardiovascular defects in
ATE1−/− embryos.

development. (A) LacZ staining of whole embryos of wild-type (a, e),

RGS4 on cross-sections of ATE1−/− embryonic

Stabilized RGS proteins in ATE1-null mice and reduced
activities of downstream effectors
Previously, we identified a set of RGS proteins (RGS4, RGS5, and RGS16) as the
primary in vivo substrates of murine ATE1 (12). Nonetheless, our understandings were mainly obtained
by means of in vitro-generated RGS proteins and transiently
transfected RGS proteins in ATE1-null MEFs because of a lack of
good antibodies. Using recently produced monoclonal antibodies (17, 18), we found that the levels of endogenous RGS4 dramatically
increased in ATE1−/− whole embryos and embryonic
brains (Fig. 3A and 3B). The RGS4 protein was virtually undetectable in
wild-type and ATE1＋/− littermate controls. The
effect of ATE1 inactivation on RGS16 levels was not as striking as that on RGS4,
but the RGS16 protein was also stabilized in ATE1−/−
mice. We also found that the amount of RGS4 was greater in the brain than in the
heart (data not shown). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of total RNA showed no
significant difference between the mutants and wild-type embryonic brains at
E13.5; this finding indicates that downregulation of RGS proteins takes place at
the posttranscriptional posttranscriptional stage (Fig. 3C). These results point to a strong spatiotemporal
correlation between protein arginylation and its substrate, RGS4, in the
developing murine brain.

serum starvation/stimulation assay of the MAPK pathway using primary

embryos at E13.5. (F) Activation profiles of the kinases quantified
using the data from panel (E).
Considering the role of RGS proteins as negative regulators in G
protein–mediated signaling as well as the prominent expression of ATE1 in
the brain and spinal cord, we tested whether the G protein–coupled
receptor (GPCR) signaling pathway in the ATE1-mutant brain is defective. To this
end, we first examined the downstream kinase activity of the GPCR signaling
pathway by an immunoblot assay using embryonic brains (Fig. 3D). Previously, we reported that the activity of
ERK1 and ERK2—downstream effectors of Gq and Gi
signaling pathways—is impaired in the whole embryo (19). In embryonic brain extracts, phosphorylated forms of
ERK1/2 and MEK1 were significantly downregulated, while total kinase levels were
comparable to wild-type levels. To further characterize the effects of ATE1 on
MAPK components, we examined responsiveness of kinase activities to serum
stimulation in primary culture of wild-type and
ATE1−/− MEFs (Fig. 3E). Primary MEFs were harvested at multiple time
points after 24 h serum starvation and subsequent 10% serum activation, and
kinase activities were measured by immunoblotting using activated
kinases-specific antibodies. The activities enhanced by serum stimulation were
observed as early as 15 min later. Nevertheless, significantly decreased levels
of active forms of RAF1, MEK1, and ERK1/2 were detected in
ATE1−/− MEFs compared to wild-type
MEFs (Fig. 3F), suggesting that the
ATE1-RGS pathway tightly regulates the MEK1-ERK1/2 pathway. Taken together,
these findings are consistent with another report showing that RGS proteins
downregulate G protein signaling in primary cardiomyocytes (19) and suggest that Gq signaling may be
reduced in ATE1-null cells because of stabilization of negative
regulators of this signaling pathway (RGS proteins) in the brain.

Defective neuronal-cell proliferation in the ATE1-null
embryonic brain
Based on the finding that MAPK signaling in the
ATE1−/− brain was reduced and
RGS-regulated Gq and Gi signaling pathways were defective,
we hypothesized that the aforementioned neural defects of
ATE1−/− embryos originate from
decreased proliferation. In addition, although the formation and shaping of the
neural plate of ATE1−/− embryos appeared
to be normal, the closure of the neural groove to from the neural tube was
slower than that of wild-types. For quantitative comparison, we examined the
rates of neural-cell proliferation in the
ATE1−/− neural tube by
immunostaining for H3P, a mitosis marker, from E11.5 to E13.5 (Fig. 4A). In wild-type embryos,
H3P-positive cells were usually observed at earlier stages (E11.5 and E12.5),
but there were little mitotic cells at E13.5.
ATE1−/− embryos showed a markedly
reduced number of cells with relative H3P-positive staining in the neural tube
(especially in the ventricular layers) in comparison with those in wild-type
littermates (Fig. 4B). The mitotic index
of wild-type neuroepithelial cells was 13.3%, while in
ATE1−/− mutants, this index was
significantly reduced: 3.5%. On E12.5, the difference was smaller: 5.9% in the
wild type versus 3.1% in ATE1−/− mice
(Fig. 4C). The size of the lumen of
the neural tube appeared to be slightly enlarged in mutant embryos on E11.5 and
E12.5. To date, not many human genes associated with neural-tube defects have
been identified although these problems are prevalent among human birth defects.
Our study indicates that the neural-tube defects observed in
ATE1−/− mice result from alterations
in proliferation of the neuroepithelial cells, which eventually differentiate
into the numerous types of neurons and glial cells in the body.

neuroepithelial cells. (A) Immunostaining for H3P on cross-sections of
wild-type and ATE1−/− neural tubes at E11.5,

(D) Amounts of NO metabolites in wild-type and
ATE1−/− whole embryos (top) and
embryonic brains (bottom) at E13.5 were measured by the Griess assay.
Values represent means ± SD (n = 3). *P ＜ 0.05 (two-tailed
t-test).
It is notable that at E11.5, no mortality or changes in gross morphological
features were seen in ATE1−/− embryos,
indicating that the impaired mitosis of neuroepithelial cells at the earlier
stage may account for the defective neural morphogenesis and, ultimately, for
the fetal death. We also studied the cell death by the TUNEL assay to determine
whether abnormally increased apoptosis results in the decreased cellular
proliferation in the ATE1−/− neural
tubes from E12.5 to E13.5. Only a few neural cells exhibited apoptotic signals
during the stages preceding the global necrosis of
ATE1−/− embryos, indicating
negligible cell death by apoptosis, and we saw no indication that the increase
in cell death contributed to this phenotype (data not shown). Therefore, protein
arginylation by ATE1 may perform an essential function in proliferation of
neuronal cells, not in apoptotic cell death.

The arginylation branch of the mammalian N-end rule pathway is implicated in
oxygen concentration–dependent degradation of target substrates (20). In yeast, N-terminal Cys is a
stabilizing (nonarginylated) residue (21). When we measured the concentration of NO metabolites, there
were significantly larger amounts of nitrites and nitrates both in whole embryos
and in embryonic brains of ATE1−/− mice. This result
is consistent with our previous finding in MEFs that RGS proteins require a
series of N-terminal modifications, including oxidation of N-terminally exposed
Cys-2 (12). This is a consequence of
competition among the post-translational modifications at the Cys-2 including
acetylation and palmitoylation, and probably, the major determining step at the
crossroads to the arginylation and acetylation branch of the N-end rule pathway.
The Arg/N-end rule pathway may function as a licensing step to regulate GPCR
signaling depending on the cellular oxygen concentration, which also varies
among developmental stages. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms have
yet to be determined, these data strongly suggest that the ATE1-RGS circuit is
implicated in normal development of the neural tube during embryogenesis.

DISCUSSION
In the N-end rule–dependent proteolytic system, the N-terminal Arg is
post-translationally attached by ATE1 Arg-transferase and functions as a degradation
determinant. We previously reported that
ATE1−/− mice die because of various
cardiovascular defects during embryogenesis (19) although the molecular etiology is still unknown. Our data in this
study collectively indicate that ATE1 is also necessary for neurogenesis, and that
the CNS phenotype observed in ATE1-null embryos may be due to a
mitotic aberration of neuronal cells. Neuronal cells undergo mitosis when they are
located lumenally; this activity is a part of closure of hollow neural tubes.
Therefore, the cellular-proliferation defects in
ATE1−/− mice may lead to malformation of
the ventricular zone accompanied with various CNS alterations. Because the neural
stem cell migration of ATE1−/− embryos was
normal, the delayed closure of the neural groove of
ATE1−/− mice appeared not due to the
defected paracrine signal of the nearby neural crest cells. Functioning of ATE1 is
necessary for degradation of RGS proteins and for proper activation of GPCR
signaling pathways probably in a cell-autonomous manner. Our findings indicate that
neuroepithelial cells and the cerebral ventricular system may account for the
embryonic death of ATE1−/− mice. Whether the
cardiac defects and neural-tube defects in
ATE1−/− embryos are independent or
causally linked has yet to be identified, and this knowledge will elucidate not only
the physiological function of ATE1 in mammals but the connection of GPCR signaling
with migration of neural crest cells during embryonic development. A recent study on
adult ATE1-null mice (created by the Cre-Lox method) showed,
however, a strikingly broad range of phenotypes (22), indicating that the ATE1–RGS–G protein circuit may be
involved in a greater variety of essential biological pathways than previously
thought. A likely explanation would be that the reduced availability of
O2 at the developing neural tube areas may be critical for
stabilizing the RGS proteins, GPCR signaling, and proper proliferation of
neuroepithelium under normal physiological conditions. Therefore, the oxygen-sensing
mechanism by the Arg/N-end rule pathway is the additional layers of the regulatory
steps of G protein signaling to maintain the proper development of the CNS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Exons 1 through 3 of the ATE1 gene were disrupted in CJ7
embryonic stem cells as previously described (16). Embryos at E10.5 to E17.5 were obtained from intercrosses of
heterozygous mice in the 129SvEv/C57BL/6 (mixed) genetic background. The
presence of a vaginal plug after overnight mating was regarded as E0.5.
Genotyping of the yolk sac or tail DNA of each embryo was performed using a
standard polymerase chain reaction.

Histological analysis and β-galactosidase staining
For histological analysis, embryos were fixed overnight at 4℃ in 4%
paraformaldehyde (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) in ice-cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The specimens were incubated with 70% ethanol, dehydrated,
embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned transversely into slices 7 μm
thick, followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). To detect the
activity of β-galactosidase on the slices, we stained the fixed samples
overnight at 37℃ in an X-gal solution (1.3 mg/ml potassium ferrocyanide, 1
mg/ml potassium ferricyanide, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1 mM [mmol/L] MgCl2,
150 mM NaCl, and 1 mg/ml 4-chloro-5-bromo-3-indolyl-β-galactoside [X-gal,
Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN] in PBS [pH 7.4]).

In vivo proliferation assay
The neural-tube slices were incubated with an anti-phosphohistone H3 (H3P)
antibody (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA; 1:100 dilution), followed by a
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson
Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). All the antibodies were incubated with the
slices for 1 h at room temperature in 1% goat serum in PBST (PBS with 10% Tween
20), and the secondary antibody was diluted 1 to 200 (23). The cells were counterstained with
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) to
visualize the nuclei.

Immunotechniques
For immunoblotting analysis, whole embryos or embryonic brains at E13.5 or E14.5
were isolated in lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM KCl, 10% glycerol,
and 0.1 mM EDTA). A soluble fraction was separated by two-step centrifugation
(9,000 × g and 100,000 × g),
subjected to electrophoresis, blotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and
probed with an anti-RGS4 or anti-RGS16 antibody (17, 18), followed by
reprobing with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma–Aldrich).

Examination of MAPK pathway effectors
To analyze activities of the MAPK pathway, we subjected total extracts from
wild-type and ATE1−/− brains and primary
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to immunoblotting with antibodies against
ERK1/2, MEK1/2, RAF1, their phosphorylated forms (Cell Signaling Technology,
Beverly, MA), Gaq (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and actin
(Sigma–Aldrich). Quantification was performed using the ImageJ software
(version 1.46r, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Quantification of NO metabolites
For measurement of nitrite (NO2−) and nitrate
(NO3−) levels in whole embryos and embryonic
brains, tissue samples from wild-type and
ATE1−/− mice were homogenized in a
buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 μM EDTA, and 0.5 μM
EGTA and were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min.
Nitrite was assayed using the Griess reaction (24). Nitrate content was determined after conversion of nitrate to
nitrite by means of Aspergillus nitrate reductase
(Sigma–Aldrich).
