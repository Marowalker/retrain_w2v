multiple cellular pathways. However, their targets and mechanism of action
associated with the autophagy pathway are not fully investigated yet.
EWSR1 (EWS RNA-Binding Protein 1/Ewing Sarcoma Break Point
Region 1) gene encodes a RNA/DNA binding protein that is ubiquitously expressed
and plays roles in numerous cellular processes. Recently, our group has shown
that EWSR1 deficiency leads to developmental failure and accelerated senescence
via processing of miRNAs, but its role in the regulation of autophagy remains
elusive. In this context, we further investigated and found that EWSR1
deficiency triggers the activation of the DROSHA-mediated microprocessor complex
and increases the levels of miR125a and
miR351, which directly target Uvrag.
Interestingly, the miR125a- and
miR351-targeted reduction of Uvrag led to the
inhibition of autophagy in both ewsr1 knockout (KO) MEFs and
ewsr1 KO mice. In summary, our study demonstrates that
EWSR1 is associated with the posttranscriptional regulation of
Uvrag via miRNA processing. The regulation of autophagy
pathway in miRNAs-Uvrag-dependent manner provides a novel
mechanism of EWSR1 deficiency-related cellular dysfunction. [BMB Reports 2015;

==== Body
MiRNAs are known to target autophagy-related genes and negatively regulate their
activities. Moreover, miRNAs modulate autophagy at different stages such as autophagic
induction, vesicle nucleation, vesicle elongation and completion, by targeting autophagy
complexes via different miRNAs. Although a growing body of evidence indicates that
miRNAs modulate autophagy, their target genes and precise roles in the autophagy
pathways have not been fully defined yet. Considering the significance of autophagy in
pathological conditions, including cellular senescence and neurodegeneration, a study on
the regulation of autophagy by EWSR1, a multifunctional protein, may provide a better
understanding of the autophagic signaling pathway. In this regard, we investigated how
EWSR1 regulates the autophagy-related cellular processes, using whole transcriptome
(mRNA) sequencing combined with miRNA arrays to analyze genes and miRNAs that are
significantly altered in ewsr1-/- mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs). We identified the transcriptome that are involved in the autophagy
pathway and directly targeted by miRNAs. Notably, we discovered that
miR351 and miR351 target Uvrag
directly, and regulate autophagy. Our group further confirmed that decreased levels of
UVRAG leads to autophagy inhibition.

Uvrag is a mammalian ortholog of yeast Vps38. It forms distinct
complexes with BECN1 (mammalian ortholog of yeast Vps30/Atg6) and the class III
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (whose catalytic subunit [PIK3C3] is the mammalian
ortholog of yeast Vps34), contributing to both autophagosome formation and maturation.
It is known that UVRAG deficiency decreases autophagy and raises uncontrolled cell
proliferation. To date, it has not been established whether EWSR1 participates in the
posttranscriptional regulation of UVRAG expression via DROSHA and miRNA-dependent
pathways. Interestingly, we discovered that Uvrag mRNA is mainly
regulated in the cytoplasm and is inversely correlated with elevated DROSHA levels in
ewsr1-/- MEFs. Since we found that DROSHA is increased
by EWSR1 deficiency, we hypothesized that UVRAG levels may be modulated
by a DROSHA-miRNAependent pathway. We performed miRNA microarray analyses and identified
that miR125a and miR351 are significantly increased in
ewsr1-/- MEFs. Indeed, our group verified that
Uvrag mRNA is a direct target of miR125a and
miR351. Even though it has been proposed that
Uvrag might be a potential target gene for miR351,
no study has proven or validated that possibility. Our data show that
Uvrag is a direct target of both miR125a and
miR351, and that EWSR1 deficiency downregulates UVRAG via a
miRNA-dependent pathway at the posttranscriptional level. Moreover, we confirmed that
the levels of UVRAG and LC3-II (autophagy marker) are significantly reduced, while the
levels of miR125a and miR351 are elevated in
ewsr1 KO mice. This in vivo finding supports the
in vitro data that EWSR1 deficiency leads to a reduction of
autophagy (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. A schema shows that autophagy is modulated through the posttranscriptional
regulation of UVRAG by miRNAs under Ewsr1-deficient condition.
Elevation of DROSHA level by EWSR1 deficiency triggers the processing of
pri-miR125a and pri-miR351 to pre-miRNAs.
Both miR125a and miR351 target and degrade
Uvrag mRNA in the cytosol. Consequently, a reduction of
UVRAG impairs UVRAG-dependent autophagy pathway. This figure is adopted from
Autophagy (2015) 11 (5):796-811.
The assembly of core BECN1 and PIK3C3 initiates autophagy with BECN1-interacting proteins
to form the autophagosome. The core complex exists in multiple forms with different
BECN1-interacting proteins, UVRAG and ATG14, in a mutually exclusive manner. Although
the direct role of UVRAG in autophagy is controversial, our current data clearly show
that a reduction of UVRAG contributes to the deregulation of autophagy in the context of
Ewsr1 deficiency, while ATG14, an alternative partner of UVRAG that
binds to BECN1, is highly expressed in the absence of EWSR1.
ATG14-containing complexes facilitate autophagosome nucleation and expansion, resulting
in early stage autophagosome biosynthesis. Interestingly, we found that ATG14 and PIK3R4
were elevated, and also LAMP1/2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1/2) and four
types of lysosomal enzymes (cathepsins) were increased in
ewsr1-/- MEFs. Based on our data, we propose that
increased LAMPs and cathepsins accelerate autolysosomal protein degradation, implying
that the enhancing autophagic flux and increased ATG14 play a mechanistic role as BECN1
binding partners to form the core complex of autophagy, instead of UVRAG. However, it
seems unlikely that increased ATG14 and the other molecules directly contribute to the
deregulation of autophagy by Ewsr1 deficiency and UVRAG reduction. In
this paradigm, UVRAG may play a major regulatory role of autophagy under
Ewsr1-deficiency conditions.

In conclusion, our results suggest that the reduced level of UVRAG by miRNAs deregulates
autophagy and contributes to cellular dysfunction in developmental processes with
Ewsr1 deficiency.
