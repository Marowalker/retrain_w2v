INTRODUCTION
Cardiac hypertrophy, the first phase of cardiovascular disease, induces heart
failure. Indeed, it is an important compensatory mechanism in response to
physiological or pathological stimuli that involve regulation of cellular signaling
mediators and transcript factors (1-3). Hypertrophic signals result in increased
protein synthesis and regulated cell cycles (4). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is a key pathway of the
cellular processes, regulating many proteins involved in cell cycle progression,
signal transduction, and apoptosis (5, 6). Alterations in UPS have been implicated in
a variety of disease such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

The relationship between UPS and cardiac diseases has been reported in recent years
(7). For example, it has been reported
that activation of the cardiac proteasome accompanies the pathogenesis of heart
conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion, heart failure, hypertrophic myopathy,
hypertension, and hypertrophy (8-10). According to one study, proteasome
inhibition suppressed disease progression and dysfunction in stimuli-induced cardiac
hypertrophy and early cardiac remodeling (11). Indeed, proteasome inhibitors altered the protein expression of
cardiomyocytes and regulated the progression of cardiovascular diseases (12-14). MG132 significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis through downregulation
of matrix metalloproteinases and collagens (15) and suppressed isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy in
cultured cardiomyocyte (16). Another
proteasome inhibitor, epoxomicin, has been reported to prevent
pressure-overload-induced cardiac hypertrophic development (9) and improve cardiac function in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy mice (17). Likewise, PS-519,
known as the irreversible proteasome inhibitor, has been reported to reduce
isoprenaline-mediated hypertrophy in mice (18).

Cholesterol is a major structural component of eukaryotic cellular membranes and a
key lipid that regulates the permeability, fluidity, curvature, and stiffness of
membranes (19, 20). Previously, cholesterol was shown to contribute to
induction of cardiac hypertrophy through activated AKT signaling pathway in H9c2
cells (21). Although some studies have
demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors suppress or reverse cardiac hypertrophy, it
remains unclear whether cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy is affected by
proteasome inhibitors.

Our study was designed to investigate the effects of proteasome inhibitors on
cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Our data reveal that proteasome inhibitors
MG132 and Bortezomib have a suppressive effect on cholesterol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy, decreasing cell surface area and expression of hypertrophic marker
genes induced by cholesterol. These results showed that proteasome inhibitors MG132
and Bortezomib inhibit cholesterol activation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) and AKT. Taken together, these data suggest that proteasome inhibitors
play an important role in the suppression of cholesterol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy.

RESULTS
Cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy is suppressed by proteasome
inhibitor
The effect of proteasome inhibitors on cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy
was examined by measuring cardiac cell surface area. H9c2 cells were treated
with 0.5-50 nM MG132 or 0.5-50 nM Bortezomib, in the presence of 5 μg/ml
cholesterol, IGF-1, or 100 nM ET-1 for 24 h. Cell surface was then measured
after staining with rhodamine phalloidin and DAPI, as described in Materials and
Methods (Fig. 1A). Consistent with a
previous study, cholesterol itself significantly increased the cell surface area
by 155%, as with ET-1 and IGF-1. Proteasome inhibitors MG132 and Bortezomib
suppressed hypertrophic growth induced by cholesterol, ET-1, and IGF-1. When
H9c2 cells were treated with more than 5 nM MG132 or 50 nM Bortezomib,
cholesterol-induced hypertrophic growth was almost completely reversed (Fig. 1B). The effective concentration of
MG132 on suppression of hypertrophic growth was a little lower than that of
Bortezomib. In the case of ET-1-induced cardiac hypertrophy, the effect of
proteasome inhibitors was almost similar to cholesterol. However, proteasome
inhibitors did not show significant effect on the IGF-1 induced cardiac
hypertrophy. Overall, proteasome inhibition by MG132 and Bortezomib suppressed
cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophic growth.

Fig. 1. Effects of proteasome inhibitors on cell surface area of
cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophic H9c2 cells. (A) H9c2 cells were
cultured in serum-free medium for 4 h and treated with MG132 (0.5-50 nM)
or Bortezomib (0.5-50 nM) in the presence of ET-1 (100 nM), IGF-1 (50
ng/ml), and cholesterol (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were fixed, and
then stained with rhodamine phalloidin (red) and DAPI (blue) for 30 min
to visualize F-actin and nuclei, respectively. (B) Images were acquired
on an Operetta system (PerkinElmer, USA) and the cell surface area was
analyzed using HarmonyⓇ High Content Imaging and
Analysis Software. The values shown are the mean ± S.D. from three
independent experiments. #P ＜ 0.05 vs
control; *P ＜ 0.05 vs cholesterol or
ET-1.
To confirm whether proteasome inhibitors have toxicity on cholesterol-induced
cardiac hypertrophic cells, H9c2 cells were treated with MG132 or Bortezomib for
24 h in the presence of 5 μg/ml cholesterol after incubation with
serum-free medium for 4 h before cells were analyzed by a WST-1 colorimetric
assay. As shown in Fig. 2A, proteasome
inhibition by MG132 had no effect on cell viability in the presence of
cholesterol. Altogether, 0.5 to 50 nM MG132 and 0.5 to 500 nM Bortezomib had no
cytotoxic effect on cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

Fig. 2. The effect of proteasome inhibitors on cholesterol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy. (A) H9c2 cells were plated on a 96-well plate and treated
with MG132 (0.5-50 nM) or Bortezomib (0.5-50 nM) in the presence of ET-1
(100 nM), IGF-1 (50 ng/ml), and cholesterol (5 μg/ml) for 24 h
after starvation for 4 h in a serum-free medium. After incubation with
WST-1 for 1 h, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a Spectra
MaxⓇ M3 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, USA).
The relative cell viability was calculated by comparison to the control
cells. The values shown are the mean ± S.D. from three independent
experiments. (B) The proteasome activity in cell lysates was quantified
using the Proteasome Activity Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision). Cell
lysates were incubated with fluorogenic substrate and Succ-LLVY-AMC.
Fluorescence intensity (350 nm excitation, 440 nm emission) was then
measured using a Spectra MaxⓇ M3 Microplate Reader
(Molecular Devices, USA). The relative proteasome activity was
calculated by comparison to the control cells. The values shown are the
mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. *P ＜0.05 vs
control. (C) Total RNA was isolated from cells with MG132 (0.5-50 nM) or
Bortezomib (0.5-50 nM), with or without cholesterol (5
μg/ml) for 24h using TrizolⓇ reagent.
qRT-PCR was performed for primers specific to β-MHC. The
expression of the target genes was expressed as the relative expression
level after normalization to the levels of actin, the internal control.
The values shown are the mean ± S.D. from three independent
experiments. **P ＜ 0.01 vs control.
Next, we examined whether proteasome activity is suppressed by treatment of
proteasome inhibitor. Proteasome activities in cell lysates were measured by
fluorescence from the cleavage of fluorogenic substrate, Succ-LLVY-AMC. The
treatment of cholesterol didn’t show any effect on the proteasome
activity. The treatment of 50 nM MG132 or 50 nM Bortezomib suppressed proteasome
activity by 82% and 80% compared with control (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that low doses of proteasome
inhibitors partially suppress proteasome activity.

We further examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the mRNA expression
level of β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), known as a hypertrophic marker
gene, by qRT-PCR. H9c2 cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 4 h and
then treated with 50 nM MG132 or 50 nM Bortezomib in the presence of 5
μg/ml cholesterol for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 2C, β-MHC expression was 12-14 times higher in the
cholesterol-treated sample than in the control. Moreover, qRT-PCR revealed that
cholesterol-induced β-MHC expression was attenuated six times by proteasome
inhibition with 50 nM MG132 and 50 nM Bortezomib (P ＜ 0.01). There was no
difference in the effective concentrations of MG132 and Bortezomib on β-MHC
expression. Jointly, 50 nM MG132 and 50 nM Bortezomib significantly suppressed
cholesterol-induced β-MHC expression in H9c2 cells.

Proteasome inhibitors suppress activation of AKT and ERK by
cholesterol
We further observed that proteasome inhibitors have an effect on cellular signal
mediators in cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. In a previous study, we
established that cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy occurred through
activation of AKT and MAPK signal pathway (21). Therefore, we investigated whether proteasome inhibitors have
an effect on the signaling pathway activated by cholesterol using western
blotting. H9c2 cells were treated with 5 or 50 nM MG132 or 50 or 500 nM
Bortezomib for 4 h before treatment with 5 μg/ml cholesterol for 1 h. Cell
lysates were then subjected to western blotting using antibodies against AKT,
ERK1/2, and mTOR. As shown in Fig. 3A,
AKT phosphorylation, the main pathway of cholesterol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy, was significantly diminished in H9c2 cells by proteasome
inhibitors. Indeed, treatment with low-dose MG132 and Bortezomib attenuated AKT
activation effectively in cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. ERK1/2
phosphorylation was also suppressed by the indicated dose of MG132 and
Bortezomib (Fig. 3B). Even though
proteasome inhibitors reduced AKT and ERK1/2 activation, their expression was
not changed. Following that, to assess the suppressive effect of proteasome
inhibitors on other signal pathways of hypertrophy, we examined mTOR activation.
Proteasome inhibitors were less effective in suppressing mTOR activation (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that
proteasome inhibitors suppressed cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy through
reduction of AKT and ERK signaling effectively.

Fig. 3. Effects of proteasome inhibitor on hypertrophic signaling pathways
activated by cholesterol. H9c2 cells were incubated with MG132 (5, 50
nM) or Bortezomib (50, 500 nM) for 4 h before treatment with ET-1 (100
nM), IGF-1 (50 ng/ml), and cholesterol (5 μg/ml). The
phosphorylation of AKT (A), ERK (B), and mTOR (C) were analyzed using
antibodies against phospho-AKTSer473 and AKT,
phospho-ERK1/2Thr 202/Tyr 204, ERK,
phosphomTORSer2448, mTOR, phospho-AKTSer473,
and AKT.
Suppressive effect of proteasome inhibitors on cell cycle of
cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy
It is reported that hypertrophic growth is related to upregulation of G1 cyclin
or cyclin-dependent kinases, and that postmitotic cardiac myocytes reenter the
cell cycle for proliferative growth (15,
22, 23). To assess how the cell cycle is regulated by
cholesterol-induced hypertrophy and reversed by proteasome inhibitors, H9c2
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry assay after treatment with 5 μg/ml
cholesterol in the presence or absence of 5 or 50 nM Bortezomib or 5 or 50 nM
MG132 for 24 h, followed by staining with propidium iodide. Fig. 4 showed that the proportion of G0/G1 phase in H9c2
cells was increased by cholesterol (84.43%), compared with the control (66.85%).
Conversely, the proportion of G0/G1 phase was significantly reduced by 50 nM
MG132 (58.32%), 50 nM Bortezomib (43.22%), and 500 nM Bortezomib (41.65%). The
G2 proportion of cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy was increased by 50 nM
MG132 and 50 nM Bortezomib from 6.25% to 15.8% and 17.28%, respectively. These
results showed that proteasome inhibitors induce reentry of the cell cycle by
G1/S phase transition in cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

cholesterol-induced hypertrophy. H9c2 cells were cultured in serum-free
medium for 4 h and treated with MG132 (5, 50 nM), Bortezomib (50, 500
nM), ET-1 (100 nM), and cholesterol (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were
fixed and then stained for 10 min with propidium iodide to visualize the
nuclei. Data were acquired on FACSCaliber and the cell cycle was
analyzed using CellQuestTM of FACSCalibur Software. *P

DISCUSSION
The importance of proteasome inhibitors has become evident for clinical treatment
potential for human diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, and cardiac
diseases. Many studies have reported that proteasome inhibitors suppressed various
cardiac diseases such as orthostatic hypotension, reperfusion injury, hypertension,
and hypertrophy (8-10). Cardiac hypertrophy has also been found to be regulated
by proteasome inhibitors. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, has been reported to
prevent artery restenosis and hypertrophic myopathy (24, 25). Recently, a study
reported that MG132 suppresses isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes
in vitro
(16). Another study shown that MG132
diminished pressure-overload-induced left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy in vivo (17). Bortezomib, the first proteasome
inhibitor approved for use as clinical drug, has been reported to reduce
cardiomyocyte surface area and inhibit angiotensin-induced cardiac hypertrophy (26). However, the effect of proteasome
inhibitors on cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy has not been examined. Here,
we determined that proteasome inhibitors MG132 and Bortezomib suppress
cholesterol-induced hypertrophic growth in H9c2 cells. We showed that low doses of
proteasome inhibitors reduce surface area of H9c2 cells without a change in cell
viability. Additionally, upregulation of β-MHC, known as a marker of cardiac
hypertrophy, was attenuated by MG132 and Bortezomib. The effect of proteasome
inhibitors on cell surface area was almost similar in both cholesterol or ET-1
induced cardiac hypertrophy. However, IGF-1-induced cardiac hypertrophy was not
clearly reversed by proteasome inhibitors. ET-1 is known as a stimulator of
pathological hypertrophy, but IGF-1 affects to physiological hypertrophy (27). The signaling pathway between ET-1 and
IGF-1 is somewhat different. Most studies related to proteasome inhibition are
performed in cardiac hypertrophy caused by pathological stimuli. Therefore,
proteasome inhibition may be a new approach in the suppression of pathological
cardiac hypertrophy.

Even though the mechanism of the protective effect of proteasome inhibitors on
cardiac hypertrophy is not thoroughly understood, inactivation of signaling
molecules in the hypertrophic pathway is suggested as the main reason.
Pressureoverload-induced (AAB) cardiac hypertrophy was markedly reduced through
decreased ERK1/2 and JNK activation by MG132 (28). Angiotensin 2-induced hypertrophy was attenuated through
activation of angiotensin type 1 receptor-mediated p38MAPK and STAT3 signal pathway
as proteasome inhibition by Bortezomib (26).
Our data also showed that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT in cholesterol-induced
cardiac hypertrophy was decreased by MG132 and Bortezomib. In a previous study, we
showed that cholesterol induces cardiac hypertrophy by activating the AKT pathway.
The treatment of LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, inhibited cholesterol-induced cardiac
hypertrophy (21). Therefore cholesterol
level is very important for activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. It is reported
that proteasome inhibitors reduce cholesterol accumulation through regulating the
stability and transcription of cholesterol export proteins (29, 30). Thus,
PI3K/AKT signaling pathways may be inhibited by alteration of cholesterol level with
the treatment of proteasome inhibitors as an underlying mechanism.

To know whether cholesterol has an effect on the proteasome directly, we examined the
changes of proteasome activity. Cholesterol treatment did not enhance proteasome
activity. However, low doses of proteasome inhibitors, to suppress cholesterol
induced cardiac hypertrophy, induced partial inhibition of proteasome activity.
These results suggest that the change of proteasome activity caused by proteasome
inhibitors may not be a major cause of attenuation of cholesterol-induced
hypertrophy. Proteasome inhibitors are reported to show inverse effects according to
dose (31). High doses of proteasome
inhibitor induce apoptosis but low doses of proteasome inhibitor suppress apoptosis
(31). Therefore, partial inhibition of
proteasomes by low doses of proteasome inhibitor may have an effect on the growth
and the hypertrophy signaling pathway by different mechanisms from high doses of
proteasome inhibitor.

The suppressive effects of MG132 and Bortezomib on cardiac hypertrophy were
accompanied by alteration of the cell cycle. The induction of cardiac hypertrophy
results in G0 or non-G0 arrest (G1 and G2) of cardiomyocytes. Inhibition or reversal
of cardiac hypertrophy was characterized by reentry into G1/S phase through
increased cyclin D1 activation (32, 33). On the contrary, p16 and p21 inhibited
reentry into G1/S phase and G1 CDK activation in vitro and
in vivo. Our results showed that the population of G0/G1 phase
cells in proteasome inhibitor-treated cells decreased compared to
cholesterol-treated cells. In addition, the proportion of G0/G1 phase cells returned
to control levels in response to 50 nM MG132 or 50 nM Bortezomib. Although we did
not examine the expression level of cyclins or CDK, proteasome inhibitors may result
in the changes of protein level of cyclins and CDK to inhibit degradation by
proteasome as shown in previous reports (34,
35).

Our data revealed the response by proteasome inhibitors in detail in
cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy. They decrease cell surface area and
expression of hypertrophic marker genes induced by cholesterol. These results showed
that proteasome inhibitors MG132 and Bortezomib inhibit the activation of ERK and
AKT by cholesterol. These results suggest that proteasome inhibition may offer a new
approach in the suppression of cholesterol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.
