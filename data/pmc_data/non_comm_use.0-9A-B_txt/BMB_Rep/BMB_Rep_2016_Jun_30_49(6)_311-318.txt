to numerous pathogens and toxic molecules. Protein expression involved in these
innate responses must be tightly regulated at both transcriptional level and
post-transcriptional level to avoid the development of excessive inflammation
that can be potentially harmful to the host. MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs
(∼22 nucleotides [nts]) that participate in the regulation of numerous
physiological responses by targeting specific messenger RNAs to suppress their
translation. Recent work has shown that several negative regulators of
transcription including microRNAs play important roles in inhibiting the
exacerbation of inflammatory responses and in the maintenance of immunological
homeostasis. This emerging research area will provide new insights on how
microRNAs regulate innate immune signaling. It might show that dysregulation of
microRNA synthesis is associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory and
infectious diseases. In this review, we focused on miR-146 and miR-125 and
described the roles these miRNAs in modulating innate immune signaling. These
microRNAs can control inflammatory responses and the outcomes of pathogenic
infections. [BMB Reports 2016; 49(6): 311-318]

INTRODUCTION
As an immediate defense mechanism in response to invading pathogens, almost all
living organisms including mammals, plants, and insects possess innate immune
responses. The innate immune system can recognize many pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) using various
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs). There are two major types of PRRs:
membrane-bound and cytosolic. They can recognize various PAMPs and DAMPs.
Intracellular signaling triggered by PRR engagement plays a crucial role in the
mounting of resistance to bacterial and viral infections via synthesizing immune
mediators and antimicrobial chemicals.

MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs with 19-23 nucleotides in length. They can
regulate mRNA expression by binding to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of
target mRNAs. Post-transcriptional regulatory functions of miRNAs include mRNA
degradation, mRNA decay, or suppression of mRNA translation (1-4). MicroRNAs
(miRNA) can influence the expression of many mRNAs, thus extensively modulating
various physiological and pathological responses (3, 5). MiRNAs serve as
important responders and contribute to the regulation of defense and inflammatory
responses of the host (6-8).

Increasing evidence supports the idea that aberrant expression of miRNAs is
associated with various aspects of local and systemic inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases (9-11). Accumulating knowledge on how miRNAs regulate toll-like receptor
(TLR) immune signaling will provide novel therapeutic strategies to control various
inflammatory diseases (11-13). In this review, we will focus on the
roles that miRNAs play and the molecular mechanisms involved in their regulation of
excessive inflammatory responses that may potentially develop when the innate host
defense system is deployed against pathogenic organisms and other dangerous
stimuli.

RESULTS
General aspects of innate immunity: an overview of TLR signaling
Many innate immune receptors recognize PAMPs and trigger intracellular signaling
cascades essential for stimulating early (and ultimately successful) host
defenses against infectious challenges (14). Of various innate immune receptors, the following two
important membrane-bound receptors will be focused in this review: TLRs and
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (15, 16). It is
becoming clear that many pattern-recognition receptors engage in crosstalk and
orchestrate the protective immunity and inflammatory responses during infections
(16). Signaling of the major
intracellular signaling pathways triggered by these PRRs will culminate in the
activation of innate immune effectors and inflammatory mediators during
infections (15, 17).

TLRs are the best characterized PRRs. They can recognize numerous ligands of a
wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The
can also bind to toxic molecules derived from host tissues or cells. Each TLR
has an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and a
cytosolic signaling domain termed toll-interleukin 1 receptor homology domain
(TIR) (15). TLR signaling triggered by
ligand engagement will cause homotypic binding of the TIR domain to partner
domains within signaling adaptors. All TLRs except TLR3 interact with adaptor
myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) that recruits members of the
IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) family. IRAK proteins will then interact with E3
ubiquitin ligase and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6
(TRAF6) to self-polyubiquitinate and recruit TAK1-binding proteins (TABs) 1-3. A
TRAF6-mediated association of TAB2 and TAB3 with ubiquitin will trigger the
activation of TAK1 (18). Such activation
is required for the phosphorylation of inhibitor of κ light polypeptide
gene enhancer in B-cells kinase (IKK) complex proteins (IKK-α, IKK-β,
and IKK-γ) and p38 kinases via activating mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinase (MKK) 3, MKK6, and MKK7. IKK complex-mediated phosphorylation of
I-κB will result in the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of
I-κB, which then triggers nuclear translocation of nuclear factor
(NF)-κB. In cells of the innate immune system, NF-κB induces the
expression of genes encoding many pro-inflammatory cytokines and costimulatory
molecules (19). In addition, another
adaptor molecule called TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β
protein can interact with both TLR3 and TLR4 and activate a TRAF3-dependent
signaling cascade that in turn will trigger the activation of TRAF family
member-associated NF-κB activator (TRAF)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and the
inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKKi). TBK1/IKKi complex will phosphorylate and
translocate transcription factor IRF3 into the nucleus, thus activating the
transcription of interferon-β gene (15).

TAK1 also activates several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways,
including ERK1/2, p38, and JNK MAPK pathways (15, 20, 21). MAPK activation requires signaling
cascade containing at least three kinases. TAK1 serves as a MAPK kinase kinase
(MAP3K) within p38 and JNK pathways crucial to the generation of immune
mediators (15, 21, 22). In
addition, TAK1 regulates the activation of COT/Tpl2 (the only MAP3K that can
activate MAPK kinases 1 and 2), leading to the activation of ERK1/2 pathway.
This ERK1/2 pathway plays roles in both innate immune response and inflammatory
response (23). All three MAPKs will
phosphorylate downstream targets (including other kinases and transcription
factors) which in turn regulate the transcription of many genes including those
encoding proinflammatory cytokines (15,
21, 22). In this review, we will describe the recent advances in our
understanding on how miRNAs regulate innate immune responses triggered by TLRs,
which in turn activate host immune defenses and inflammation. The roles played
by miRNAs, the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate the components of
TLR-signaling pathways, and the relevance of such actions in the context of host
defense and inflammatory disease will be discussed.

Overview of miRNA biogenesis
Biogenesis, roles in target recognition and post-transcriptional gene regulation,
and other biological functions of miRNAs have been discussed extensively in many
earlier reviews (24-26). Thus, we will only briefly summarize
miRNA biogenesis here. MicroRNAs are well-known small noncoding RNA molecules
that control gene expression by interacting with mRNAs. The first miRNA was
discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans in 1993 (27, 28). In mammalian cells, miRNAs are predicted to target more than
30% of protein-encoding mRNAs. Therefore, miRNAs regulate genes in almost all
biological processes. By base-pairing to mRNAs, miRNAs can inhibit the
translation or increase mRNA turnover (25). To date, many miRNAs of mammalian cells have been identified
and studied. miRNAs CAN modulate a variety of essential biological responses to
physiological, stressful, and pathogenic conditions (26, 29). MiRNAs
are crucial regulators of a variety of cellular processes. It is now becoming
clear that aberrant miRNA expression is a general signature of many human
diseases, including cancer, metabolic disorder, and immune disease (30-32).

During miRNA biogenesis, mature miRNAs are generated from long primary miRNA
transcripts (pri-miRNAs) via a sequence of biochemical steps (24, 33). In the nucleus, processing of a pri-miRNA into a pre-miRNA
(∼70 nts) involves recognition of the stem-loop structure of miRNA by an
RNase III/Drosha-DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 complex (34, 35). After export of pre-miRNA into the cytoplasm by exportin 5
(36, 37), dicer (a member of the RNase III superfamily of
ribonucleases) will interact with RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading
complex and process the pre-miRNA to release a ∼22-nt miRNA–miRNA*
duplex with a 2-nt 3' overhang at either end (34, 38, 39). The double strands of this duplex are
separated by an RNA helicase (40). One
miRNA strand (the guide strand) of the duplex is then loaded into an
Argonaut-containing RISC (41, 42). Finally, the single-stranded mature
miRNA will pair with mRNAs by interacting with the 3' UTRs of those mRNAs (43). This will cause translational
repression and/or mRNA destabilization and degradation (4, 5, 24).

Functional importance of miRNAs in innate immunity
It is becoming clear that miRNAs play major roles in the regulation of immune
cell differentiation, release of inflammatory mediators, host defense, and
various immunological diseases (9, 44, 45). Many miRNAs that are rapidly induced by the activation of
innate immune system have been discussed extensively in several excellent
reviews (11, 13). Therefore, we will not visit these topics here. In
this review, we will briefly focus on miR-146a, miR-146b, miR-125a, miR-125b,
and their regulation of innate immune response, inflammatory response, and
antimicrobial response (46-52).

MiR-146 and innate immune response regulation: MiR-146a, a
NF-κB-associated gene (46), has
been studied extensively for its role in innate immunity (53). This miRNA plays an essential role in negative
regulation of the production of proinflammatory cytokines, thus modulating the
severity of inflammatory response (54).
Earlier studies have suggested that miR-146a is involved in linking innate
immune response to oncogenic transformation (55-57). MiR-146a plays a
critical role in regulating the proliferation of immune cells and inhibiting
inflammatory responses (56, 57). An miR-146a deficiency in mice is
associated with chronic dysregulation of NF-κB signaling, yielding a
phenotype with characteristics of myeloid malignancy (57) (Fig. 1).
Indeed, the gene encoding miR-146a (encoded on chromosome 5q33.3) has been
reported to be absent in hematopoietic progenitor cells (deletion mutations in a
segment of chromosome 5q) of many myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with
5q-syndrome (58).

Fig. 1. The levels of miR-146a and miR-146b are regulated by innate immune
signaling. The levels of miR-146a and miR-146b are up- or down-
regulated by TLR-induced intracellular signaling. TLR3 activates
PI3K-JNK and NF-κB signal pathways, which up-regulates the level of
miR-146a. TLR2 signaling activates the IRAK1-TRAF6-NFκB pathway
that enhances inflammatory responses through producing proinflammatory
cytokines and chemokines. The activation of miR-146a decreases
proinflammatory cytokines via inhibiting IRAK1 and TRAF6. MiR-146b level
is up-regulated by TLR4 signaling through STAT3 and IL-10.
Angiopoietin-1 induces miR-146b expression. The expression of miR-146a
is negatively regulated by IFN-induced CARD10-IRAK1 pathway.
Both miR-146a and miR-146b can regulate inflammatory responses by targeting mRNAs
encoding IRAK-1 and TRAF6 (46, 53, 59, 60). An in
vivo deficiency in miR-146a can trigger macrophage hyperactivation,
elevate the systemic response to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), and
predispose to the development of an autoimmune phenotype later in life (56). In addition, one study has shown
that miR-146a is characteristically upregulated in LPS-adapted human monocytic
cells, suggesting that miR-146a might be a key regulator in endotoxin tolerance
(61).

Recent in vivo studies using a lentivirus expressing miR-146a
(LmiR-146a) have shown that miR-146a is essential to the prevention of
sepsis-induced NF-κB signaling and the generation of inflammatory cytokines
as well as the inhibition of IRAK and TRAF6 expression in the myocardium, thus
attenuating cardiac dysfunction often associated with sepsis (62). TLR3-stimulation of human nasal
epithelial cells can induce miR-146a synthesis via phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K), JNK, and NF-κB pathways (63). Notably, miR-146a plays an important role in the expression of
tight junction proteins claudin-1 and JAM-A, suggesting that miR-146a is
essential to the maintenance of tight junction barrier and innate immune defense
(63). In primary human
keratinocytes, miR-146a can inhibit the development of NF-κB-dependent
inflammatory responses by directly targeting recruitment (by the upstream
nuclear factor kappa B) of the following three signal transducers: caspase
domain-containing protein 10, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, and chemokine
(C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 5 (64).
Moreover, TLR2 stimulation can trigger sustained expression of miR-146a, which
in turn will suppress the synthesis of IL-8, CCL20, and TNF-α in primary
human keratinocytes (65). In addition,
activation of TLR4 signaling can upregulate miR-146b expression in human
monocytes via the action of IL-10-mediated STAT3-dependent pathway (51). In turn, miR-146b can negatively
regulate LPS-mediated production of many proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines. MiR-146b fulfills these roles by targeting many components of
signaling pathways, including TLR4, MyD88, IRAK-1, and TRAF6 (51). In human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs), prolonged expression of angiopoietin-1 can significantly
decrease LPS-induced IRAK1 and TRAF6 levels via upregulating miR-146b-5p
expression. Interestingly, angiopoietin-1 cannot influence the expression levels
of miR-146a or miR-146b-3 in HUVECs (66). Together, these studies have demonstrated that both miR-146a and
miR-146b are critical negative regulators of the activities of various cell
types in the innate immune system, thus preventing the development of harmful
inflammatory responses and promoting the maintenance of homeostatic conditions
(Fig. 1).

MiR-125 and innate immune regulation: Recent studies have shown that
miR-125a-5p plays an important role in inhibiting the classical M1-type
activation induced by LPS stimulation. In addition, miR-125a-5p can promote
IL-4-induced expression of the alternative M2 phenotype by targeting KLF13, a
transcriptional factor that is active during T lymphocyte activation and
inflammation (50). Additionally,
miR-125a-5p can suppress the phagocytic and bactericidal activities associated
with macrophage M1 functionality (50).
Earlier studies have shown that the expression levels of both miR-125a-3p/5p and
miR-146a are regulated at transcriptional level after Listeria
monocytogenes infection that altered the miRNA profiles of host
macrophages (67). The precise functions
of these miRNAs remain unclear. Our recent study has shown that miR-125a-3p can
inhibits antimicrobial responses and host defenses against mycobacterial
infection by targeting the gene encoding autophagy UV
radiation-resistance-associated protein (68). Together, these data suggest that miR-125a may inhibit innate
macrophage responses by regulating macrophage differentiation, inflammation, and
autophagy (Fig. 2A).

Fig. 2. The roles of miR-125a and miR-125b in the regulation of innate and
inflammatory responses. (A) MiR-125a-3p and miR-125a-5p negatively
regulate host defense and bactericidal activity. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), Listeria
monocytogenes, and several TLR ligands activate innate immune
pathways involving MyD88. Listeria monocytogenes
activates the expression of miR-125a-3p and miR-125a-5p.
Mtb infection upregulates miR-125a-3p levels and inhibits UVRAG
expression, which modulates antimicrobial responses and host defense.
MiR-125a-5p inhibits M1 phenotype activated by TLR ligands such as
Pam3CSK4 (Pam3) and LPS. IL-4 induces the expression of miR-125a-5p and
promotes M2 phenotype. MiR-125a-5p may control phagocytic and
bactericidal activities through inhibiting KLF3. (B) LPS-induced Akt
signal pathway is down-regulated by miR-125b. 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LO)
expression is decreased by miR-125b-5p. MiR-125b positively regulates
inflammatory responses. IFN-gamma stimulates the activation of miR-125b
following inhibition of IRF4, which promotes inflammation and antitumor
activities.
Interestingly, the expression of miR-125b-5p (which has the same core sequence as
miR-125a-5p) is modulated by NF-κB signaling. miR-125b-5p targets the
3’UTR region of TNF-α gene to negatively regulate the inflammatory
response (49) (Fig. 2B). The expression levels of both miR-125b and
miR-155 are negatively regulated by LPS-induced Akt1 activation. This can
regulate the extent of endotoxin tolerance/sensitivity in mice (69). In addition, LPS stimulation of
human macrophages can suppress the expression of miR-125b. However, estradiol
pretreatment can eliminate this effect, thus enhancing the stability of
κB-Ras2-encoding mRNA. κB-Ras2 is a key inhibitor of NF-κB
signaling (70). Recent data have shown
that miR-125b-5p can directly target and inhibit the expression of a gene
encoding 5-lipoxygenase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes
essential for both innate immune responses and inflammatory processes (71). However, another study has reported
that miR-125b can promote macrophage-mediated inflammation, increase the
expression of co-stimulatory factor, and enhance antitumor activities by
targeting Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) (72) (Fig. 2B). These data
suggest that miRNAs play different roles in diverse biological contexts.

Clinical implications of miR-146 and miR125 expression in patients with
inflammatory diseases
Dysregulation of miRNA expression is associated with the pathogenesis of many
human diseases, indicating that miRNAs may serve as novel diagnostic or
therapeutic targets. The relevance of miR-146a in disease contexts is now
well-accepted. Early studies have shown that miR-146a expression levels are
significantly increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from rheumatoid
arthritis patients, although the levels of TRAF6 and IRAK1 (two targets of
miR-146a) in patients are similar to those in healthy controls (73). MiR-146a expression levels are
elevated in keratinocytes and skin disease lesions of patients with atopic
dermatitis. In human primary keratinocytes, miR-146a can inhibit the expression
of many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including CCL5, CCL8, and
ubiquitin D. In addition, it has been reported that miR-146a-deficient mice
exhibit exacerbated inflammation with accumulation of infiltrating cells in the
dermis and increased skin inflammation (64). Moreover, aberrant expression of miR-146a (the gene of which
resides on chromosome 5q) is associated with dysregulation of innate immune
response and the development of clinical 5q-syndrome, a subtype of
myelodysplastic syndrome (58). Triple
deletion of genes encoding TRAF-interacting protein, forkhead-associated domain
B protein (TIFAB), and miR-146a has been shown to increase the level of TRAF6
protein, sustain TRAF6-mediated signaling, and trigger hematopoietic
dysfunction, partly explaining the pathogenesis of high-risk MDS and acute
myeloid leukemia associated with chromosome 5q deletions (74, 75). Recent
studies have revealed an interrelationship between miR-146a synthesis and the
pathogenesis of hepatic injuries developed after hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection (76). MiR-146a expression
levels are upregulated in HBV-infected cells, infected mice per se, and human
HBV-infected patients. HBV X protein-induced NF-κB signaling is required
for the expression of miR-146a, which in turn downregulates the level of the
mRNA encoding complement factor H, a negative regulator of the alternative
pathway of complement activation. Thus, miR-146a may play a role in the
immunopathogenesis of chronic hepatitis B infection (76).

Compared to miR-146a, much less is known about the roles of miR-125a-5p in
inflammatory disease. MiR-125a levels are significantly reduced in patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It has been reported that MiR-125a
overexpression can inhibit the levels of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal
T-cell expressed and secreted) inflammatory chemokines by controlling the
expression levels of a predicted target gene KLF13
(77). In addition, miR-125a-5p
expression is reduced in active lesions of multiple sclerosis patients (78). Further analysis has shown that
miR-125a-5p is required to enhance the tightness of the brain endothelial
barrier and to stimulate the formation of thick cell-cell junctional complexes
in the brain endothelium (78). Recently,
it has been shown that miR-125a is essential in terms of regulatory T cell
function because this miRNA can suppress the expression of effector T cell
factors. MiR-125a levels are downregulated in peripheral CD4+ T cells
of patients with autoimmune SLE and Crohn's disease (79). MiR-125b has clinical relevance in patients with
chronic eosinophilic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps because the levels of
miR-125b are elevated in patients and such elevation can regulate the extent of
inflammation in sinonasal mucosal samples of these patients (80). MiR-125b upregulation can elevate
IFN-β mRNA levels in airway epithelial cells by targeting EIF4E-binding
protein 1 (4E-BP1), thus exacerbating mucosal eosinophilia (80). Thus, miRNAs can modulate the expression levels of
genes involved in almost all cellular functions (Fig. 3). Further exploration of the roles they play in pathogenesis
and defenses of innate immune responses against infections will yield
miRNA-derived therapeutics useful for treating many human inflammatory
disorders.

inflammatory diseases. MiR-125 and miR-146 levels are upregulated or

syndromes (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and Hepatitis B virus
infection (HBV). Lower panel: down-regulated miRNA mediates multiple
sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), experimental

and Crohn’s disease.
DISCUSSION
Our understanding on the roles of miRNAs in innate immune signaling and inflammation
has advanced rapidly and extensively over the past several years. Based on data from
recent studies, it can be concluded that both miR-144 and miR-125 are important
regulators in innate immune responses. They play many roles in the regulation of
innate immune responses to both pathogenic infections and nonpathogenic
inflammation. Identification of other miRNAs that may modulate the (complex)
activation of innate immune responses remains a topic of interest. MiRNAs are
emerging as potential diagnostic markers. They are important translational
regulators in many human disease states, including inflammation and infectious
diseases. Unraveling the miRNA network is important so that we can understand the
pathogenesis of many human inflammatory diseases to develop potentially useful
treatments. Accumulating basic research data on miR-146 and miR-125 have identified
their novel roles and the molecular mechanisms involved. Such work will lead to the
development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for immune disease and
inflammation.
