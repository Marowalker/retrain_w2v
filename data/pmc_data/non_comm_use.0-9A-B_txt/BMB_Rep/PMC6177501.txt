MicroRNAs have been determined to contribute various cancers initiation and progression, including AML. Although microRNA-204 (miR-204) exerts anti-tumor effects in several kinds of cancers, its function in AML remains unknown. In the present study, we assessed miR-204 expression in AML blood samples and cell lines. We also investigated the effects of miR-204 on cellular function of AML cells and the underlying mechanisms of the action of miR-204. Our results showed that miR-204 expression was significantly downregulated in AML tissues and cell lines. In addition, overexpression of miR-204 induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in AML cells, including AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 cells. Cell cycle analysis further confirmed an augmentation in theapoptotic subG1 population by miR-204 overexpression. Mechanistically, baculoviral inhibition of apoptosis protein repeat containing 6 (BIRC6) was identified as a direct target of miR-204. Enforcing miR-204 expression increased the luciferase activity and expression of BIRC6, as well as p53 and Bax expression. Moreover, restoration of BIRC6 reversed the pro-apoptotic effects of miR-204 overexpression in AML cells. Taken together, this study demonstrates that miR-204 causes AML cell apoptosis by targeting BIRC6, suggesting miR-204 may play an anti-carcinogenic role in AML and function as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease.

INTRODUCTION
Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancer cells. A group of proteins known as the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) play a relevant role in apoptosis resistance in a wide range of cancer cells (1, 2). Increased IAP expression has been observed in a variety of human cancers, including AML (1). Baculoviral inhibition of apoptosis protein (IAP) repeat containing 6 (BIRC6), is the largest member of IAPs family with a unique ubiquitin-conjugating domain, which differs from other members, suggesting a particular role of this protein in the IAP family (3). In childhood AML, higher BIRC6 expression was associated with unfavorable response to therapy (4). Similar results were also obtained by Carter et al. demonstrating that BIRC6 overexpression negatively influenced overall 3-year survival in childhood AML (5). These findings indicate that downregulation of BIRC6 may contribute to anti-carcinogenic effects in AML.

Another critical regulator of cell apoptosis, p53, has been well documented to be involved in carcinogenesis (6). It is worthy to note that p53 is an important downstream effector of BIRC6 (1). In addition to MDM2, BIRC6 is also the most crucial E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53. BIRC6 binds to p53 and ubiquitinates p53 for proteasomal degradation (6). Previous study has been reported the carcinogenic effect of BIRC6 through attenuating p53 function in hepatocellular carcinoma (7). Therefore, the balance between BIRC6 and p53 is significant for p53 expression and function to exert its effect in tumor suppression.

Accumulating evidences have implicated that MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulation is critical in AML pathogenesis. MiR-204 is reported to play a relevant role in the development of gastric cancer (8), prostate cancer (9, 10), ovarian cancer (11), colorectal cancer (12), cervical cancer (13), and melanoma (14). For example, miR-204 suppressed cell proliferation in gastric cancer by targeting CSK1B, GPRC5A and CXCL1 (8). Moreover, miR-204 was downregulated in cervical cancer tissues which plays an important role in regulating cervical cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion (13). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) repressed miR-204 via a STAT3-binding sits and in turn increased cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells (11). A recent study observed that miR-204 expression was markedly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, which suggests a promising significance of the association of miR-204 expression with hepatocellular carcinoma pathological features (15). Similarly, Song et al. found that miR-204 was one of the downregulated miRNAs in prostate cancer tissues that were suitable for predicting the different stage of prostate cancer (10). However, the functional role of miR-204 in AML is still poorly understood and needs for investigation. In the current study, we provide the first evidence demonstrating that miR-204 induces human AML cell apoptosis by directly targeting BIRC6. Our data indicate that miR-204 may be a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of AML.

RESULTS
MiR-204 is decreased in clinical AML samples
To unveil the role of miR-204 in AML, the expression level of miR-204 was first examined in blood samples of patient with AML. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that miR-204 expression was significantly decreased in AML samples compared with normal samples (Fig. 1A). In addition, we found lower expression of miR-204 in human AML cell lines such as AML2, AML5, AML193, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 than in normal cell line HS-5 (Fig. 1B). The data indicate that miR-204 may play an anti-tumor role in the progression of AML.

MiR-204 overexpression induces apoptosis in human AML cells
The above findings demonstrated that miR-204 expression in AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 was relative lower than other AML cell lines. Thus, these four cell lines were chosen to investigate the effect of miR-204 on cellular function. The results from CCK-8 assay showed that overexpression of miR-204 significantly suppressed, whereas miR-204 inhibition increased the viability of AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 cells (Fig. S1A and B). We next determine whether miR-204 was able to induce AML cell apoptosis. Our results showed that overexpression of miR-204 markedly induced apoptosis in AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 cells compared with control group, respectively (Fig. 2A and B). To clarify whether miR-204 inhibits AML cell viability through alteration of cell cycle distribution, population in different phases of cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. The results revealed that the subG1 population representing the apoptotic cells was dramatically increased after miR-204 overexpression (Fig. 2C and D). This was further supported by western blotting results showing that miR-204 overexpression markedly increased cleaved Caspase-3 expression (Fig. S1C). The data indicate miR-204 inhibits AML cell viability via induction of apoptosis rather than inhibition of cell proliferation.

MiR-204 upregulaiton activates p53-dependent apoptosis pathway by targeting BIRC6
To understand the mechanism by which miR-204 induces AML cell apoptosis, we used computational mRNA target analysis online software (www.Targetscan.org) to predict the potential target gene of miR-204. The results showed that miR-204 may directly target BIRC6, a gene known to be involved in the regulation of cell apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Results from western blotting analysis showed that the protein expression of BIRC6 in AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 was significantly decreased after miR-204 upregulation (Fig. 3B). However, miR-204 inhibition increased BIRC6 protein expression in these AML cell lines (Fig. 3C). To investigate whether miR-204 decreased BIRC6 expression through direct 3′UTR interaction, BIRC6 3′UTR luciferase reporter was constructed and luciferase assay was performed. The results showed that upregulation of miR-204 significantly decreased the luciferase activity in the above four cell lines transfected with wild-type BIRC6 3′UTR, but not in cells transfected with the mutant vector (Fig. 3D).

Given that P53, an important factor in regulating tumor growth and apoptosis, can be ubiquitinated and degraded by BIRC6 (13), we next examined the expression of p53 in these AML cell lines. Western blotting showed that protein expression of p53 in AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 cells was significantly increased after miR-204 upregulation, which exhibited a reciprocal pattern of BIRC6 expression. Moreover, the protein expression of Bax, a p53 target gene was also markedly increased after miR-204 overexpression (Fig. 3E). On the contrary, opposite results were obtained in cells treated with miR-204 inhibitor (Fig. 3F). These results suggest that miR-204 increases p53 expression and transcriptional activity, which subsequently activates its dependent apoptotic pathway.

Restoration of BIRC6 reverses the enhanced effect of miR-204 on AML cell apoptosis
To confirm that whether downregulation of BIRC6 is a major mechanism that responsible for the induction of AML cell apoptosis by miR-204, we constructed BIRC6 plasmid, and then measured its effect on cell viability and apoptosis upon miR-204 overexpression. Expectedly, upregulation of BIRC6 obviously attenuated miR-204 overexpression-induced the decrease of BIRC6 expression and the increase of p53 expression (Fig. 4A). CCK-8 assay showed that the inhibitory effect of miR-204 on AML cell viability was significantly attenuated by transfection of BIRC6 plasmid (Fig. 4B). Moreover, overexpression of BIRC6 inhibited miR-204 mimics-induced the increase of apoptotic ratio in AML5, HL-60, Kasumi-1 and U937 cells (Fig. 4C). Similarly, following restoration of BIRC6 expression, the increased percentage of subG1 phase in miR-204 mimics-treated cells was also reduced (Fig. 4D). These results further support the critical role of BIRC6 in miR-204-induced AML cell apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
Induction of apoptotic cell death has been considered as a conventional therapy for cancer chemoprevention (16). Nevertheless, evasion of apoptotic response in cancer cells promotes tumor initiation, development and drug resistance (1). A lot of researches have indicated that miR-204 plays a role as an anti-carcinogenic gene in many type of cancer studied (9, 11–13, 17). Notably, despite miR-204 is highly expressed in leukemia, its function has not yet reported in AML (17–19). It has been known that most apoptosis signalings are activated by intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathways that regulated by pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic protein in Bcl-2 family (9, 20). Among these members, Bcl-2 functions as an anti-apoptotic protein and has been observed to be the target of miR-204 in gastric cancer, colon cancer, neuroblastoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (17, 20). Thus, induction of apoptosis seems to be the major mechanism underlying the anti-carcinogenic effect of miR-204. Here, we used four different leukemic cell lines to investigate the function of miR-204 in AML. In addition to AML5 cells, HL-60 is an acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1 is an acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line and U937 is one of lymphoma cell lines. The results showed that overexpression of miR-204 decreased viability and induced apoptosis in AML cells. Moreover, miR-204 upregulation in AML cells was associated with cell cycle arrest in the subG1 phase containing subdiploid or apoptotic cells, further confirming that miR-204 suppresses AML cells growth through induction of apoptosis rather than inhibition of cell proliferation.

To clarify the mechanisms by which miR-204 induces AML cell apoptosis, we used custom prediction of TargetScan to predict the target of miR-204. The potential target of miR-204 that could be involved in apoptosis led us to focus on BIRC6, a member of the IAPs family, which protects cells from apoptosis (3). Silencing BIRC6 resulted in growth inhibition of several cancer cells and increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy (6, 21). Several miRNAs have been evidenced to control BIRC6 through binding to specific target sequences in the 3′UTR of the gene, as shown for miR-BART15, miR-342 and miR-446h (22–24). In this study, we found that overexpression of miR-204 was associated with suppression of BIRC expression and luciferase activity, suggesting that miR-204 directly targets to the 3′UTR of BIRC6. Correspondingly, our study showed that miR-204 overexpression increased p53 and its target gene Bax expression. This indicates that miR-204 inhibits BIRC6, which may in turn increase p53 expression and activate p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. Although the anti-carcinogenic role of miR-204 may be partially due to its ability to suppress the expression of Bcl-2 (17), the mechanism of directly targeting BIRC6 provides a new insight into the anti-apoptotic effect of miR-204. Moreover, considering that BIRC6 is the ubiquitin ligase for p53, which causes p53 degradation and inhibits its down-stream mitochondria-dependent apoptosis pathway (2, 3), our findings showing that miR-204 negatively regulates BIRC6 expression seem to be more significance. Similar to previous observations that BIRC6 upregulation was resistant to various anticancer drugs in different cancer cells (2, 4, 25), the effect of miR-204 on apoptosis through BIRC6 was further confirm in our study using BIRC6 plasmid in AML cells. Notably, in addition to ubiquitin degradation function, BIRC6 carries a baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domain characteristic for the binding sites of Caspase and confers cell apoptosis (26). Moreover, Caspase in turn mediates BIRC6 degradation, which further decreases chemoresistance in human cancer (27). These findings suggest that BIRC6 also regulates cell apoptosis by a p53-independent pathway. Further study to clarify the different mechanisms of BIRC6 involved in the regulation of apoptosis in cancer cells is warranted.

In summary, our study demonstrated that miR-204 was frequently downregulated in AML blood sample and cell lines. MiR-204 overexpression induced apoptosis in AML cells. We also showed a direct interaction between miR-204 and BIRC6. These results reveal a novel pro-apoptotic role of miR-204 in AML cells, suggesting that miR-204 may be a promising therapeutic target for AML treatment.
