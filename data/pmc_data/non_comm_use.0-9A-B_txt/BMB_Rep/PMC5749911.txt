However, the epigenetic modulation of regulatory B cells is largely unknown. Recent studies showed that the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein inhibitor JQ1 controls the expression of various genes involving cell proliferation and cell cycle. However, the role of BET proteins on development of regulatory B cells is not reported. In this study, JQ1 potently suppressed IL-10 expression and secretion in murine splenic and peritoneal B cells. While bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) was associated with NF-κB on IL-10 promoter region by LPS stimulation, JQ1 interfered the interaction of BRD4 with NF-κB on IL-10 promoter. In summary, BRD4 is essential for toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated IL-10 expression, suggesting JQ1 could be a potential candidate in regulating IL-10-producing regulatory B cells in cancer.

INTRODUCTION
B cells have long been known to have antibody production and antigen presenting functions. Recent studies have also confirmed the existence of a regulatory B cell subset with the ability to regulate the inflammatory response just as regulatory T cells (Tregs) do (1). In addition, the immune regulation of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (Breg or B10) has been reported in inflammatory immune diseases such as contact hypersensitivity, collagen-induced arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, anaphylaxis, and food allergy (2–7). Recently, the distribution and partial functions of regulatory B cells have been reported in some cancers, and regulatory B cells are expected to have a mechanism to inhibit immune cell activity against cancer cells like Tregs (8–11).

IL-10-producing regulatory B cells have various phenotypes such as CD1dhiCD5+, CD21hiCD23+ (Transitional 2-marginal zone precursor (T2-MZP)), Tim-1+, CD9+, and are known to produce anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 or Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β (12–15). The deficiency of IL-10-producing regulatory B cells further exacerbates the development of a variety of inflammatory immune diseases but the mechanism of IL-10 production from regulatory B cells in anti-inflammatory responses remains unclear. While recent studies have uncovered the mechanism regulating the production of IL-10 in the cytoplasm of B cells such as the B-cell linker (BLNK) subtype signaling pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), there is a lack of research on the signaling system such as transcription in the nucleus (16, 17).

The bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein family consists of four proteins including BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and tetris-specific BRDt, is known to read acetylated lysine on histones in the nucleus and change chromatin structure through their bromodomain (18, 19). As development of a couple of BET protein inhibitors, the role of BET proteins have been highlighted and they play critical functions in a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, cell cycle, inflammation, and cancer development (20–22). Among BET protein inhibitors, JQ1 has been widely used as a potent, relative BRD4 selective and the first generation inhibitor (23).

In B cell immunology fields, BET bromodomain has been known to be involved in the development of germinal center B cells and the switching of immunoglobulins in B cells (24, 25), but it has not yet been studied how BET bromodomain functions in IL-10-producing regulatory B cells. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that IL-10 production in regulatory B cells is reduced via interfering interaction of BRD4 at the promoter of IL-10 which NF-kB co-binds by JQ1, and verify that BRD4 plays an important role in transcriptional activation for the production of IL-10 in regulatory B cells. Our results suggest that JQ1 can be used as a novel therapeutic molecule for anti-cancer immunity targeting regulatory B cells.

RESULTS
LPS-stimulated IL-10 production is controlled by JQ1 in B cells
First, the expression of IL-10 gene in splenic B cells was confirmed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. IL-10 gene expression in splenic B cells was increased in response to LPS stimulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B). It was also found that IL-10 secretion by splenic B cells was also increased by LPS stimulation (Fig. 1C). Next, the expression of IL-10 in B cells by JQ1, a specific inhibitor of BRD4, was examined. IL-10 gene expression decreased in a dose-dependent manner when splenic B cells stimulated with LPS were treated with JQ1 (Fig. 1D and E). The concentration of JQ1 treatment in vitro were determined at the preliminary experiment (Supplementary Fig. 1), and the JQ1-mediated regulation of IL-10 gene expression and secretion by LPS was not due to cytotoxicity (Fig. 1F).

BRD4 pathway is associated with the development of IL-10-producing B cells
We observed that the treatment of JQ1 did not change the phenotype of B cells (Fig. 2A). It is well known that the frequency of IL-10-producing B cells is closely related to the splenic CD1dhiCD5+ phenotype (12). We next checked whether the decrease in IL-10 production function of B cells by JQ1 correlates with the decrease of CD1dhiCD5+ B cells. Unexpectedly, there was no frequency change of CD1dhiCD5+ B cells by a JQ1 treatment (Fig. 2B). Flow cytometry analysis showed that IL-10 production in LPS-induced B cells decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). In previous study, Tedder and coworkers reported that precursor cells of regulatory B cells can differentiate into mature regulatory B cells by long-term stimulation of LPS (26). The effect of JQ1 on the differentiation of precursor cells by long-term LPS stimulation was also investigated. JQ1 reduced the differentiation of precursor cells to mature IL-10-producing regulatory B cells (Fig. 2D and E).

The major population of regulatory B cells in the peritoneal cavity (PeC) has the phenotype of CD5+CD11b+ (B-1a). The changes of CD5+CD11b+ regulatory B cells by JQ1 were examined and it was found not to induce any phenotypic change as in splenic regulatory B cells (Fig. 2F). However, it was also observed that IL-10 production of LPS-induced B cells was decreased by JQ1 as in splenic regulatory B cells (Fig. 2G). Consistently, the differentiation of precursor cells of PeC regulatory B cells by the long-time treatment of LPS and the IL-10 secretion of PeC B cells were also suppressed by JQ1 (Fig. 2H and I). Of note, the production of IL-10 in splenic CD1dhiCD5+ and PeC CD5+CD11b+ B cell subsets, but not the other subsets, were suppressed by JQ1 (Supplementary Fig. 2). These results suggest that the BRD4 pathway affects LPS-induced IL-10 production in spleen and peritoneal cavity but not regulatory B subset frequency. Therefore, we hypothesized that the BRD4 pathway is associated with the signal transduction pathway for the production of IL-10 in regulatory B cells.

LPS treatment does not affect expression of BET proteins and NF-κB in B cells
Next, we investigated whether LPS stimulation can change the expression of BET proteins themselves. As a result, any change of BET proteins was not observed in splenic B cells by stimulation of LPS (Fig. 3A to D). The expression of NF-κB p65 was also not changed by the treatment of LPS (Fig. 3E and F). Additionally, we hypothesized that the suppression of IL-10 production from B cells by JQ1 is associated with the expression of NF-kB p65. We then found that JQ1 did not alter the expression level of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 3G), suggesting that the negative mechanism of JQ1 is not directly associated with the levels of NF- kB p65 in the process of IL-10 production in regulatory B cells.

JQ1 inhibits the recruitment of BRD4 and NF-κB p65 at IL-10 promoter region upon LPS stimulation
In the TLR signal transduction pathway by LPS stimulation, several reports demonstrated that the multiple chromatin complex with NF-kB p65 are formed at IL-10 DNA regulatory regions (27, 28). Besides, NF-kB was also known to interact with BRD4 in other cells (29). Based to these, we designed three sites for IL-10 DNA regulatory regions covering the hyper sensitive site (HSS, upstream 4.5 kb) (30), distal promoter (DP, upstream 1.2 kb), and proximal promoter (PP, upstream 0.2 kb) (31, 32) which are known as functional DNA elements for IL-10 transcription (Fig. 4A). We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay with antibody against BRD4 and NF-κB p65 in splenic B cells. We found that NF-κB p65 binding, but not BRD4, was increased at two promoter sites by LPS (Fig. 4C and D). Interestingly, the ChIP analysis revealed significant increase in binding of BRD4 on IL-10 proximal promoter among three sites where the greater NF-κB p65 binding was observed concurrently and these recruitments suppressed by JQ1 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we argue that BRD4 may be critical for NF-κB p65 binding on IL-10 proximal promoter for the production of IL-10 in regulatory B cells.

DISCUSSION
In the past decade, the suppressive effects, mainly through the secretion of IL-10, of regulatory B cells on inflammatory responses have been reported in a variety of immune disorders (33–36). Additionally, immune regulation through the interaction of immune cells with the intrinsic phenotype of regulatory B cells (e.g., CD1dhiCD5+, T2-MZP, Tim-1+, and CD9+) were demonstrated in various diseases, and it plays a critical role in autoimmune diseases (37). In recent studies, functional studies in cancer diseases are emerging (38–40). In particular, the change of the distribution of regulatory B cells in cancer tissue is considered to one of important indicators (8–10). Emerging evidence suggests that regulatory B cells suppress effector immune cells including IFN-γ-producing cytotoxicity cells in various cancer diseases through the secretion of IL-10 (11). Although regulatory B cells have to play the suppressive role on the effector function of T cells in autoimmune diseases to cure diseases (41), regulatory B cells need to be suppressed to induce anti-cancer immunity to cure cancer.

As development of BET protein inhibitors, there are tremendous effort to apply these drug to various fields such as cancer and immune disorders. In cancer, they are well known as pivotal regulators for the expression of several oncogenes, such as c-Myc and Bcl-2 (42, 43). Moreover, several BET protein inhibitors have been under clinical research (44). However, there is no study on the relationship between BET proteins and regulatory B cells, especially for IL-10 production. Furthermore, the epigenetic mechanism the production of IL-10 in the nucleus of regulatory B cells is largely unknown. This study proposes BRD4, a chromatin reader is a critical modulator of regulatory B cells. We found that the gene expression and secretion of IL-10 by LPS stimulation were reduced in regulatory B cells by the treatment of JQ1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). The effect of JQ1 is not due to the induction of changes of regulatory B cell phenotype but modulation of the IL-10 production in regulatory B cells (Fig. 1G and Fig. 2).

It is generally accepted that LPS-mediated TLR4 signal pathway is critical to increase the frequency of IL-10 producing regulatory B cells. However, the epigenetic regulation on the production of IL-10 in regulatory B cells by LPS is not well unknown. It has reported that BRD4 is interacted with various proteins including several transcription factors. Among them, NF-kB is critical for the production of IL-10 (27–29). In this study, we examined whether the relationship between BET proteins and NF-κB (a major transcription factor for IL-10 production by LPS) were altered by LPS stimulation. The expression of total BRD4 (also BRD2 and BRD3) and NF-κB p65 proteins was not affected by LPS stimulation or JQ1 treatment in B cells (Fig. 3A to G). These results suggest that BRD4 may be directly involved in transcriptional activation IL-10 via the TLR4 signal by LPS. Therefore, we further assessed the role of BRD4 in LPS-mediated IL-10-producing B cells by using ChIP assay. Three major sites such as hyper sensitive site (HSS), distal promoter (DP), and proximal promoter (PP) were investigated by ChIP assay. LPS stimulation caused recruitment of BRD4 and NF-kB to the IL-10 proximal promoter region of B cells, and this process was inhibited by JQ1 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that BRD4 play critical role for production of IL-10 of regulatory B cells. Although it was reported that BRD4 directly binds to acetylated NF-kB p65 in LPS stimulation (45), whether both proteins are directly interacted in regulatory B cells remained to be determined.

In summary, this study demonstrates that BRD4 as a novel epigenetic regulator directly participates in the transcriptional process for IL-10 production via altering chromatin structure in regulatory B cells upon LPS simulation and presumably this mechanism could contribute anti-cancer effects of JQ1 in various cancer diseases.
