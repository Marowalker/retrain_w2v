to cell interactions. Endothelial cell interactions regulated by growth factors,
inflammatory cytokines, or hemodynamic stress are critical for balancing
vascular quiescence and activation. Yes-associated protein (YAP), an effector of
Hippo signaling, is known to play significant roles in maintaining cellular
homeostasis. However, its role in endothelial cells for angiogenic regulation
remains relatively unexplored. We demonstrated the critical role of YAP in
vascular endothelial cells and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms
involved in angiogenic regulation of YAP. YAP was expressed in active angiogenic
regions where endothelial cell junctions were relatively loosened. Consistently,
YAP subcellular localization and activity were regulated by VE-cadherin-mediated
PI3K/Akt pathway. YAP thereby regulated endothelial sprouting via angiopoietin-2
expression. These results provide an insight into a model of coordinating
endothelial junctional stability and angiogenic activation through YAP. [BMB

==== Body
Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional co-activator, has been implicated in
contact inhibition of cell growth and control of organ size. YAP activity is regulated
in part by phosphorylation and subcellular localization through Hippo pathway. Recently,
YAP has been suggested to play a role in mechanotransduction in Hippo-independent
manner. Given that endothelial cell-cell contact and hemodynamic force is critical for
the regulation of vascular homeostasis, YAP is expected to play important roles in
endothelial cell function. A previous study showing the defects in yolk sac
vasculogenesis of Yap knockout mice (E.M. Morin-Kensicki et al. Mol Cell Biol 26:77-87.
doi: 10.1128) also supports this hypothesis. YAP has also been reported to regulate
endothelial cell proliferation in vitro (Z. Shen et al. PloS One,
2015;10(1); e0117522. doi: 10.1371). Nonetheless, the expression and functions of YAP in
endothelial cells of vessels are not clearly determined yet. Our study has shown that
YAP is expressed in developing mouse retinal vessels and tumor vessels. Subcellular
localization and nuclear activity of YAP in endothelial cells was regulated by cell to
cell contact similar to other cell types. Suppression of YAP in endothelial cells
inhibited endothelial cell function such as the ability of forming tubular network on
Matrigel or sprouting from EC-coated microbeads. Further, endothelial sprouting from
mouse aortic ring and vascular branching of mouse retinal vessel was also affected by
YAP depletion.

New vessel formation derived from pre-existing vessels is called angiogenesis. It occurs
through activation of quiescent endothelial cells upon stimulation. Endothelial
activation is accompanied by instability of cell to cell junction. VE-cadherin, an
endothelial specific junctional molecule, not only mediates adherence junctional
formation, but also triggers intracellular signaling for cell dynamics and
proliferation. Several transcriptional factors including FoxO1 and β-catenin
mediates VE-cadherin-induced signaling in genetic regulation. We identified YAP as an
important transcriptional regulator that transduces signal from VE-cadherin mediated
endothelial cell to cell contact to the nucleus. Our current study showed that in
quiescent endothelial cells, VE-cadherin expression and clustering was important in
maintaining the inactivated of YAP through phosphorylation. Disruption of VE-cadherin
clustering or suppression of VE-cadherin expression resulted in the activation of YAP.
We also showed that VE-cadherin dependent YAP phosphorylation required the activation of
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of YAP was
increased by genetic or pharmacologic blockade of Akt pathway in confluent endothelial
cells.

Angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), an autocrine factor released from active endothelial cells, plays
important role in vascular remodeling. Although it is well known that ANG-2 synthesis
and secretion are dynamically regulated in endothelial cells, detailed mechanism of its
regulation is not clearly understood. Here, we identified ANG-2 as a transcriptional
target of YAP in endothelial cells. YAP and ANG-2 was co-localized in endothelial cells
of mouse retina and tumor vessels. Reduced expression and overexpression of YAP in
HUVECs resulted in a decrease and an increase of ANG-2 expression, respectively.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and luciferase activity assay of ANG-2 promoter
indicated that ANG-2 was transcriptionally regulated by YAP. The addition of recombinant
ANG-2 protein partially compensated vascular defects caused by YAP depletion.
Altogether, these results indicate that ANG-2 transcriptionally regulated by YAP in
endothelial cells can promote vascular remodeling and angiogenesis in an autocrine
way.

In conclusion, our results suggest that YAP plays significant roles in genetic regulation
during vascular remodeling and sprouting (Fig.
1). Angiogenesis starts from endothelial cell activation which accompanies
dramatic changes in cell junctions, cytoskeleton, and gene expression. However, it has
not been clearly defined on how these events are linked and cooperated. Since abnormal
endothelial cell activation occurs in multiple pathophysiological conditions including
tumor and inflammation, understanding the molecular mechanism that mediates endothelial
cell junctional stability and activation is essential to the development of therapeutic
means to improve these pathologic conditions. Although further studies are needed to
understand what factors will destabilize endothelial junctions that affect YAP activity
and how, our results revealed the role of YAP as a linker connecting endothelial cell
junctional stability to genetic changes during vascular remodeling, thus providing
further insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the angiogenic activation of
endothelial cells by YAP.

Fig. 1. YAP may be maintained in inactivated state by VE-cadherin-PI3/Akt signaling
axis in quiescent endothelial cells. VE-cadherin clustering not only induces
catenine complex formation, but also induces Akt activation pathways. When
VE-cadherin-mediated cell to cell contact is disrupted in a variety of
pathophysiological conditions, PI3/Akt pathway is inactivated, which results in
nuclear localization of YAP. Nuclear YAP induces ANG-2 for angiogenic sprouting
and vascular remodeling. Destabilized actin cytoskeleton might also affect YAP
activity in endothelial cells. This requires further investigations (Figure is
reproduced from an original article published in Nature Communications).
