(erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway on bone
metabolism under oxidative stress. We investigated how Nrf2/HO-1 pathway affects
osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells in response to hydrogen peroxide
(H2O2), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), or
both. Exposing the cells to H2O2 decreased the alkaline
phosphatase activity, calcium accumulation, and expression of osteoblast
markers, such as osteocalcin and runt-related transcription factor-2. In
contrast, H2O2 treatment increased the expression of Nrf2
and HO-1 in the cells. Treatment with hemin, a chemical HO-1 inducer, mimicked
the inhibitory effect of H2O2 on osteoblast
differentiation by increasing the HO-1 expression and decreasing the osteogenic
marker genes. Pretreatment with NAC restored all changes induced by
H2O2 to near normal levels in the cells. Collectively,
our findings suggest that H2O2-mediated activation of
Nrf2/HO-1 pathway negatively regulates the osteoblast differentiation, which is
inhibited by NAC. [BMB Reports 2015; 48(11): 636-641]

==== Body
INTRODUCTION
Numerous studies have been performed to clarify the mechanisms by which oxidative
stress negatively or positively modulates osteoblast differentiation and
mineralization. It is believed that excessive oxidative stress decreases bone
formation by down-regulating differentiation and viability of osteoblasts (1, 2). The intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
osteoblasts leads to oxidative stress-mediated bone damage (3). It is also believed that ROS accumulation stimulates bone
resorption by activating the intracellular signaling involved in osteoclast
differentiation, as well as by diminishing the capacity of cellular antioxidant
defense systems (4, 5). In contrast, the administration of antioxidant compounds,
such as α-tocopherol succinate and N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC), exerted protective effects on oxidative damages (6, 7). Accordingly, it is suggested that oxidative stress disrupts the
differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts, and this disruption is prevented
by antioxidants.

The induction of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is known to play
important roles on the protection of tissues or cells from various oxidative damages
(8, 9). Specifically, oxidative stress evokes nuclear Nrf2 translocation, in
which the transcription factor leads to the recognition of antioxidant response
elements on target genes. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is one of the main oxidative
stress markers which are induced by the activation of Nrf2. The induction of HO-1
regulates numerous cellular responses involved in iron homeostasis, antioxidant
defense mechanism, and bone resorption (10-12). Accordingly, it is
suggested that the Nrf2/HO-1 signal is sensitively activated by oxidative stress to
maintain the intracellular redox balance and the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway
tightly affects the processes required for bone homeostasis (13, 14). However, it
is important to note that Nrf2 interferes with the transcriptional activation
dependent on runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2), eventually leading to
negative regulation on the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts (15). Furthermore, the differentiation and
mineralization of osteoblasts was inhibited by upregulating the HO-1 (16). These reports suggest a controversial
role of Nrf2/HO-1 signal on osteogenesis.

Here, we examined the effects of oxidative stress on osteoblast differentiation and
Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, by exposing the MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts to various concentrations of
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We also investigated the effects of
NAC on osteogenic marker expression and mineralization in
H2O2-exposed osteoblasts. In addition, we explored whether
hemin, a chemical inducer of HO-1, mimicked the inhibitory effects of
H2O2 on osteoblast differentiation and mineralization.

RESULTS
H2O2 inhibits dose-dependently ALP activity, calcium
accumulation, and viability in MC3T3-E1 cells
Cells were treated with various concentrations (0-400 μM) of
H2O2 in osteoblast differentiating medium for 7 days
and then the cells were evaluated for their differentiation and viability.
Exposing the cells to H2O2 caused a dose-dependent
reduction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and calcium accumulation, where
significant decreases were noted at 100 μM (Fig. 1A). It was also seen that exposing to concentrations higher
than 200 μM H2O2 decreased viability of the cells
(Fig. 1B).

accumulation, and viability in a dose-dependent manner. Cells were

H2O2. (A) ALP activity and calcium content,
and (B) viability of the cells, were measured after 7 days of exposure.

H2O2 increases the induction of Nrf2 and HO-1 in
osteoblasts
We next examined whether H2O2 is the direct mediator to
activate Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in osteoblasts. The addition of 100 μM
H2O2 increased the HO-1 protein and mRNA levels in
MC3T3-E1 cells, which were further augmented by treatment with 200 or 400
μM H2O2 (Fig.
2A, B). H2O2 treatment also increased the
nuclear level of Nrf2, with a simultaneous reduction of nuclear Runx2 in the
cells (Fig. 2C, D).

with attendant corresponding reduction of Runx2 in MC3T3-E1 cells. Cells
were exposed to the indicated doses of H2O2. The
HO-1 protein (A) and mRNA levels (B), and the nuclear protein levels of
Nrf2 and Runx2 (C) were determined after 24 h of incubation by
immunoblotting or RT-PCR. (D) Relative intensities of Nrf2 and Runx2
proteins from triplicate experiments are shown. *P < 0.05, **P <

NAC inhibits H2O2-mediated decrease in osteoblast
differentiation by down-regulating the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1
We explored whether the H2O2-induced changes in the
induction of Nrf2, HO-1, and Runx2 are related to oxidative stress by incubating
the cells with 200 μM H2O2in combination with 2.5 or
5 mM NAC. NAC significantly inhibited the
H2O2-induced increases in HO-1 induction (P
< 0.001) and Nrf2 nuclear translocation (P < 0.05) by restoring the
nuclear Runx2 level (Fig. 3A, B). NAC
treatment almost completely blocked the H2O2-induced
reduction in osteocalcin (OCN) mRNA level (Fig.
3C), ALP activity (Fig. 3D),
and calcium content (Fig. 3E) in the
cells.

Cells were incubated with 200 μM H2O2 in the
presence and absence of 2.5 mM or 5 mM NAC. (A, B) Protein levels of

HO-1 induction inhibits mineralization and calcium accumulation in MC3T3-E1
cells
We further investigated the regulatory roles of HO-1 on osteoblast
differentiation by treating the cells with hemin. In this study, the cells were
treated with 50 μM hemin for 24 h and then the osteogenic medium was
changed to the medium without hemin. Thereafter, the cells were additionally
incubated for various times (0-14 days) according to the experimental purpose.
Pretreatment with hemin for 24 h decreased the bone-like nodule formation in
MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 4A). Hemin at 20 or
50 μM also reduced the ALP activity (Fig.
4B) and calcium accumulation (Fig.
4C) in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with hemin at the same
concentrations dose-dependently augmented the expression of HO-1 at 24 h of
additional incubation (Fig. 4D), while it
decreased the mRNA expression of Runx2 (Fig.
4E) and OCN (Fig. 4F), as well
as the nuclear level of Runx2 (Fig. 4G).
However, the HO-1 inducer at 10 μM did not change the ALP activity and
calcium content, or the expression of osteogenic markers in the cells (data not
shown). The negative effect of hemin on osteoblast differentiation of MC3T3-E1
cells was not due to cytotoxic effect, in that the treatment with 20 or 50
μM hemin for 1 day did not reduce viability of the cells (Fig. 4H, left panel). In contrast,
co-incubation with more than 20 μM hemin for 3 days caused a slight
reduction in viability of the cells (Fig.
4H, right panel).

Fig. 4. The increase of HO-1 induction by hemin reduces the expression of
osteogenic markers and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells. Cells were
pretreated with the indicated concentrations of hemin in osteogenic
medium for 24 h; the medium was replaced with fresh medium without
hemin, followed by additional incubation for various times.
Mineralization of the cells was evaluated by alizarin red staining (A)
and ALP activity assay (B) at 7 days of incubation, or by calcium
content determination (C) at 14 day post-incubation. The mRNA
expressions of HO-1 (D), Runx2 (E), and OCN (F), and the nuclear level
of Runx2 (G), were determined after 24 h of incubation by real time
RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, respectively. Panel H shows viability
of the cells exposed to 20 μM and 50 μM hemin for 1 or 3 days

DISCUSSION
The differentiation processes of osteoblasts can be distinguished mainly by two
steps, i.e. extracellular matrix maturation and mineralization which are controlled
by various osteogenic markers (17). ALP is
one of the earliest markers expressed during the osteoblast differentiation process,
while OCN, a non-collagenous and vitamin K-dependent protein, is secreted by mature
osteoblasts during matrix calcification (18). Our present findings reveal that H2O2
dose-dependently inhibits the maturation and mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells, along
with the decreased expression of osteogenic markers.

There are a number of studies that have shown the beneficial effects of NAC on
mineralization from osteogenic (19) and on
survival rates in mice exposed to irradiation (5). Consistent with these reports, our data show that NAC at 5 mM
reverses the effects of H2O2 to suppress the osteoblastic
differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. This protective effect of NAC was accompanied by
the restoration of bone specific markers ALP and OCN. NAC treatment also inhibited
the H2O2-mediated increases of Nrf2 and HO-1 induction in
MC3T3-E1 cells. However, NAC treatment alone did not cause any change in the
viability, DNA synthesis, and the levels of cellular ROS and HO-1 protein, as well
as the HO-1 enzymatic activity, in MC3T3-E1 cells (data not shown). These results
strongly support that the decrease in the osteoblast differentiation and
mineralization caused by the excessive oxidative stress is prevented by
antioxidants.

We previously found that Nrf2-mediated signaling could play dual roles on the
viability of cells depending on the condition of stress exposed; under a mild
oxidative stress, Nrf2 activation has a protective role by maintaining normal levels
of ROS, whereas it leads to cell injury under a persistent oxidative stress (20). However, the current results highlight
that activation of the Nrf2 pathway by H2O2 contributes
predominantly to the down-regulation of microenvironmental events required for
osteoblast differentiation. There is a report showing that
H2O2 exposure within the range of non-toxic concentrations
diminishes mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells, and this is accompanied by reduced
osteogenic marker expression and increased Nrf2 induction (21). This is also supported by the current findings which
show that exposure only at 400 μM H2O2 significantly
decreased viability of the cells. Further studies on the upstream regulators of
Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in H2O2-exposed osteoblasts are required. It
is also necessary to elucidate how Nrf2 affects Runx2-dependent transcriptional
activation in oxidative stress-exposed osteoblasts.

Upregulation of HO-1 by hemin exerts a beneficial effect on wound healing (22). The induction of HO-1 suppressed
osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in an arthritis model (11). It was also reported that HO-1 induction upregulated the
osteogenic differentiation in human periodontal ligament cells (23). However, HO-1 induction is also able to negatively
regulate osteoblast differentiation, depending on microenvironmental conditions
(24). It was also reported that
treatment with hemin decreased the mRNA expression of osteogenic markers and calcium
deposition in osteoblasts (16). These
reports with our present findings suggest that upregulation of HO-1 may inhibit the
maturation and mineralization of osteoblasts. It is also likely that
H2O2 at relatively high concentrations leads to HO-1
activation, and this is the critical event responsible for the decreased
osteogenesis in MC3T3-E1 cells.

In conclusion, this study highlights that oxidative stress may reduce the maturation
and mineralization in MC3T3-E1 cells via the activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the
decreased expression of bone differentiation markers. The down-regulation of Runx2
and the corresponding reduction of ALP and OCN are the important events related to
H2O2-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and
mineralization (Fig. 4I). Our current
findings also reveal that NAC restores all the H2O2-induced
changes to near levels of untreated control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and laboratory equipment
Unless otherwise specified, chemicals and laboratory wares were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC. (St. Louis, MO, USA) and Falcon Labware
(Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), respectively.

Cell cultures
MC3T3-E1 cells (ATCC, CRL-2593) were cultured in αminimum essential medium
(α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT,
USA) and antibiotics. Culture medium was replaced twice per week. After cells
reached 70-80% confluence in 6-well or 96-multiwell culture plates, the medium
was replaced with osteoblast differentiating medium (α-MEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 nM dexamethasone, 50 μM ascorbic acid, and 5 mM
β-glycerophosphate).

H2O2exposure
MC3T3-E1 cells incubated in osteogenic medium were exposed to various
concentrations (0-400 μM) of H2O2 in the presence and
absence of 2.5 mM and 5 mM NAC. After various times (0-14 days) of exposure, the
cells were evaluated for their ALP activity, calcium content, viability, Nrf2
and HO-1 induction, bone-specific gene expression, and mineralization.

Measurement of viability
The ability of cells to reduce 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl-)-2,5 -diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT), where the reducing activity is proportional to the
viability of the cells, was measured according to methods described elsewhere
(25).

Determination of mineralization and ALP activity
The degree of mineralization was determined at 7 days after
H2O2 exposure by staining the cells with alizarin red,
according to the methods described previously (26). Intracellular calcium content was measured using a Calcium C
kit (Wako Chemical Inc., Osaka, Japan). The calcium content was expressed as the
relative percent to the non-treated control level. ALP activity was measured by
the methods described previously (27),
and the enzyme activity was expressed as the relative percent to the control
value.

RNA preparation and polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was prepared using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) and reverse-transcribed using a RNA PCR kit, according to the
instruction manuals (Access RT-PCR System, Promega). The quantitative
amplifications were performed using a DNA thermal cycler (model PTC-100, MJ
Research, Waltham, MA, USA), and the amplified PCR products were detected by
ethidium bromide staining after electrophoresis in 1-2% agarose gels. Band
intensity was calculated using a gel imaging system (model F1-F2 Fuses type T2A,
BIO-RAD, Segrate, Italy). The mRNA expression of HO-1, Runx2, and OCN was also
determined by real-time RT-PCR, according to the methods described previously
(28). In brief, cDNA synthesis was
performed with 1 µg of total RNA using SuperScript Reverse Transcripatase
II and oligo12-18 primers. Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to detect the accumulation of PCR
product during cycling with the ABI 7500 sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems).The PCR primer sequences specific for OCN, Runx2, and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) have been described earlier
(28). Primer sequences for HO-1 are
5'-aagaggctaagaccgccttc-3' and 5'-gcataaattcccactgccac-3'. All the PCR reactions
were performed at least in triplicate, and the expression levels were normalized
to GAPDH signal in the same reaction.

Western blot analysis
The nuclear and whole cell proteins were prepared at various intervals after
H2O2 or hemin exposure, according to the methods
described previously (29). Equal amounts
of protein samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto PVDF
membranes. Blots were probed with primary antibodies and incubated with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-lgG in a blocking buffer for 1 h. The
blots were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare,
Buckinghamshire, UK) and exposed to X-ray film (Eastman-Kodak, Rochester, NY,
USA). The antibodies specific for Runx2 (M-70: sc-10758, rabbit IgG), HO-1
(C-18: sc-1796, goat IgG), Nrf2 (C-20: sc-722, rabbit IgG), lamin B (C-20:
sc-6216, goat IgG), and α-tubulin (B-7: sc-5286, mouse IgG2a)
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis
Unless specified otherwise, the data are expressed as the mean ± standard
deviations (S.D.) from triplicate experiments (at least three samples per
experiment). A one-way analysis of variance (SPSS version 12.0 software)
followed by Scheffe’s test was applied to determine the significance of
differences between groups. A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
