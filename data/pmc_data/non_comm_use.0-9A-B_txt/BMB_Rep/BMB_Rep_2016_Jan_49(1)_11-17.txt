being exposed to various antigens, which provides unique microenvironment for
the immune system in the intestine. Accordingly, the gut epithelium harbors the
most T lymphocytes in the body as intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), which are phenotypically and
functionally heterogeneous populations, distinct from the conventional mature T
cells in the periphery. IELs arise either from pre-committed thymic precursors
(natural IELs) or from conventional CD4 or CD8αβ T cells in response
to peripheral antigens (induced IELs), both of which commonly express CD8α
homodimers (CD8αα). Although lineage commitment to either conventional
CD4 T helper (Th) or cytotoxic CD8αβ T cells as well as their
respective co-receptor expression are mutually exclusive and irreversible
process, CD4 T cells can be redirected to the CD8 IELs with high cytolytic
activity upon migration to the gut epithelium. Recent reports show that master
transcription factors for CD4 and CD8 T cells, ThPOK (Th-inducing
BTB/POZ-Kruppel-like factor) and Runx3 (Runt related transcription factor 3),
respectively, are the key regulators for re-programming of CD4 T cells to CD8
lineage in the intestinal epithelium. This review will focus on the unique
differentiation process of IELs, particularly lineage re-commitment of CD4 IELs.

INTRODUCTION
The intestine is the biggest immunological organ in our body with its huge surface
that is constantly exposed to foreign matters, such as food and pathogens (1). There is a delicate balance between
protective immunity against detrimental pathogens and tolerance to food and
beneficial bacteria. To keep the homeostatic balance, various immune cells are
located in the gut epithelial lining. Among the immune cells, lymphocytes located
within the gut epithelium are intestinal intraepithelial
lymphocytes (IELs), which represent the largest heterogeneous T
cell population in the organisms. Due to the constant exposure of antigens at the
mucosal barrier, IELs have unique and antigen-experienced activated phenotypes,
constitutively expressing CD8α homodimer, CD8αα, and CD103 (αE
integrin), distinct from the conventional T cells in the periphery. Further, they
are suggested to play a pivotal role in providing protective immunity as the first
line of immune defense (reviewed in Ref 2-4).

In this review, we discuss the development, subtypes, and functions of IELs,
especially focusing on the unusual CD4 IELs expressing CD8α homodimer,
CD4CD8αα double positive (DP) IELs. There are decent reports recently
revealed that conventional CD4 T cells post-thymically reprogram to cytotoxic T
lymphocyte (CTL)-like DP IELs expressing CTL-lineage associated genes in the gut
microenvironment (5,6). We focus on how conventional CD4 T cells in the periphery
reprogram their cellular fate from the T helper lineage to the CTL-like DP IELs in
the gut environment.

SUBSETS OF IELS
IELs can be classified into “natural” and “induced”
categories based on their developmental origin and co-receptor expressions (2-4).
Natural IELs (nIELs), previously classified as “type b” IELs,
differentiate unconventionally from their own precursors and are activated during
selection process in response to self-antigens in the thymus. They are barely
detectable in peripheral mainstream lymphoid tissues and express either αβ
T cell receptor (TCR) or γδ TCR with a unique co-receptor,
CD8αα, without conventional CD4 or CD8αβ co-receptors
(CD8αα TCRαβ IELs or CD8αα TCRγδ IELs).
Induced IELs (iIELs), previously “type a IELs”, are derived from the
conventional CD4 or CD8αβ T cells in the periphery and postthymically
differentiated in the intestine. They are αβ TCR-bearing CD4 or
CD8αβ T cells with a predominance of CD8 T cells, which have much in
common with conventional CD4 and CD8αβ T cells found in the spleen and
other lymphoid tissues. These conventional iIELs also co-express CD8αα
together with CD4 or CD8αβ, thus the expression of CD8αα is a
hallmark of IEL populations in the gut epithelium (2-4).

UNIQUE DEVELOPMENT OF IELS
Originally, nIELs are thought to differentiate thymus-independently. Early experiment
described that thymectomy has little effects on the generation of IELs in the
intestine (7), and CD8αα IELs are
present in neonatally thymectomized mice reconstituted with bone marrow or fetal
liver (8-10). Studies show that cryptopatches (CP) in the small intestine contain
IEL precursor cells (11, 12), and that CP cells from nude mice are able
to reconstitute IELs (12), further
supporting the idea that nIELs are derived extra-thymically from CP precursors.
However, increasing evidence supports the importance of thymus and thymic
progenitors for nIEL development. It has been reportedly observed that the number of
CD8αα IELs is extremely reduced in athymic mice (9, 13, 14), indicating that thymus is functional for
nIEL development. Moreover, a genetic fate mapping study showed direct evidence that
all CD8αα-bearing αβ TCR IELs originate from
CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes rather than CP precursors (15). The thymic development of nIELs is
further clarified by the identification of thymic precursors of CD8αα
IELs. Cheroutre and co-workers discovered that
CD4+CD8αβ+CD8αα+ triple
positive (TP) cells in the thymus, distinct from classical
CD4+CD8αβ+ DP thymocytes, are unique precursors
for CD8αα IELs, which are selected and matured in a
“alternative“ way by strong interactions with self-antigens, termed
“agonist selection” (16) (Fig. 1). As a result, they become mature,
memory-like CD4−CD8αβ− αβ or
γδ TCR-expressing T cells and acquire gut-homing capacity in the thymus,
thereby directly migrating to the intestinal epithelium (16, 17).

Fig. 1. Development and subsets of IELs. Natural CD8αα IELs (nIELs)
differentiate from unique thymic precursors,
CD4+CD8αβ+CD8αα+
triple positive (TP) cells, which go through a self antigen-based thymic
selection process (“agonist selection”). On the other hand,
induced IELs (iIELs) are derived from the circulating conventional CD4 or
CD8αβ T cells, which further undergo post-thymic differentiation
process.
Contrary to nIELs, iIELs are the progeny of conventional MHC class I-restricted
CD8αβ or MHC class II-restricted CD4 naïve T cells that further
undergo post-thymic differentiation process in the intestine (reviewed in ref 2-4).
Naïve T cells are activated in response to antigens in the periphery,
particularly gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), including Peyer’s patches
(PPs) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and then migrate into the intestinal
epithelium to become iIELs. It is well known that CD103+ dendritic cells
(DCs) in the GALT with their ability to produce the vitamin A metabolite, retinoic
acid (RA), confer the gut-homing capacity to naïve T cells they prime (18, 19). RA induces gut-homing receptors,
α4β7 and CCR9 on T cells, which bind to mucosal
adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) and CCL25, respectively (20). These are constitutively expressed on small intestinal
endothelium and epithelium, thus directing T cells to traffic into the intestine
(21-23). In the intestine, T cells subsequently down-regulate
α4 subunit of α4β7 and gradually
acquire αE (CD103) expression to form integrin
αEβ7
(24, 25), which is induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in the
gut environment (26).
αEβ7 is a major adhesion molecule, which
mediates selective localization or retention of IELs to the epithelial compartment
of the intestine by interacting with E-cadherin expressed on the basolateral surface
of enterocytes (27).

FUNCTIONS OF IELS
The precise physiological functions of IELs are not still clear. Yet, their strategic
location at the front line of defense and concomitant expression of effector and
regulatory molecules allows us to predict that these cells are of importance for
controlling pathogen infection and preserving the integrity of epithelial barrier in
the gut. Although CD8αα TCRαβ IELs are self-reactive and
cytotoxic effectors with high granzyme B expression (3), they are not self-destructive, and instead they have been shown to
mediate immune regulation by expressing several regulatory molecules including
interleukin-10 (IL-10), TGF-β and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG 3) (28, 29). In a mouse model of induced colitis, self-specific CD8αα
TCRαβ IELs exert a regulatory function by controlling the migration and
activity of pathogenic CD4 T cells in the intestine (28). Nevertheless, it is still possible that these self-reactive
CD8αα TCRαβ IELs may drive autoimmune pathology under
inflammatory or damaged conditions (4).
TCRγδ IELs also contribute to protective immunity, secreting TNF and
IFN-γ (30) and keep gut integrity
through producing TGF-β1, TGF-β3 and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) to
repair epithelial damage (31).

CD8αβTCRαβ IELs are reported to serve as long-residing effector
memory cells within the epithelium to provide protection against various invading
pathogens, including simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (32, 33), lymphocyte
choriomeningtis virus (LCMV) (34), and
rotavirus (35). Studies suggest that CD4
IELs, though a minor subset compared to natural or CD8αβTCRαβ
IELs, may contribute to the prevention of immunopathology in the intestine by
exerting their protective and regulatory functions (36, 37).

CD4CD8αα IELS
In general, CD4 T cells are known as helper cells in terms of their ability to
modulate the functions of other immune cells, such as cytotoxic T cells, B cells and
antigen presenting cells. However, their effector functions as CTLs and the
existence of CD8-expressing CD4 T cells have continuously been reported over the
decades, particularly during virus infection (38-40). Nevertheless, the
cytotoxic activity of CD4 T cells has been considered an in vitro
artifacts or a functional variant of T helper 1 subset in vivo, and
there is little convincing evidence to support this subset of CD4 T cells as an
independent subtype of CD4 T cells (41).

Two important reports recently identified CD4 CTLs as a distinct subset of effector
CD4 T cells, which express co-receptor CD8αα and CTL lineage genes
distinguishing them from any other conventional CD4 T helper subsets or regulatory T
cells (5, 6). At steady state, these cytotoxic CD4 T cells are mostly found in the
small intestine as CD4CD8αα double positive (DP) IELs (42) and can be experimentally generated in
the T cell transfer model of colitis, in which naïve T cells are transferred
into lymphopenic hosts (5, 6). Remarkably, these reports show that the
cytotoxic DP IELs lack ThPOK, the master transcription factor for CD4 Th lineage
commitment, of which expression is maintained highly in the peripheral conventional
CD4 T cells and critical for their helper functions. DP IELs are initially
originated from conventional CD4+ThPOK+ T cells, which lose
ThPOK expression post-thymically upon migration to the gut (5). The loss of ThPOK is induced by Runx3-mediated silencing,
the master transcription factor for the CD8 CTL lineage program, thus
CD4+ThPOK−T cells reprogram to MHC-II-restricted
cytotoxic CD4 T cells (6).

ThPOK-Runx3: MASTER TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORS FOR CD4CD8αα IEL
DEVELOPMENT
The co-receptor expression of either CD4 or CD8αβ is precisely correlated
with T cell function as helper or killer T cells, respectively. Therefore, this
lineage decision process from CD4+CD8+ DP thymocytes to either
lineage is crucial in T cell biology and extensively studied over the decades. With
the identification of the ThPOK transcription factor (43, 44) and its
counteraction with Runx3 (45), it is now
widely accepted that this key developmental decision is made at the transcriptional
level.

ThPOK is a key transcription regulator, which drives CD4+CD8+
thymocytes to become mature CD4 T cells, and Runx3 is required for CD8 T cell
development (46, 47). The fate decision of helper or CTL is driven by the
antagonistic interaction between these two transcription factors, as ThPOK is highly
expressed and maintained in mature CD4 T cells in the periphery, preventing
Runx3-mediated CTL program. On the other hand, Runx3 expression is preferentially
up-regulated during CD8 lineage differentiation in the thymus and remains high in
mature CD8αβ T cells, which represses ThPOK expression by binding to
silencer of ThPOK gene in immature CD8αβ thymocytes (46, 47). In addition to silencing CD4 by repressing ThPOK, Runx3 also
reactivates CD8 by directly binding to Cd8 enhancer, E8I, of the
CD8 gene locus (48).

It has long been thought that CD4-CD8 lineage commitment is mutually exclusive and
irreversible. Although mature CD4 T cells are able to differentiate into separate
subtypes of helper T cells in response to peripheral antigens, such Th1, Th2, Th17,
and regulatory T cells, they maintain their ThPOK expression and helper lineage gene
profiles (5, 49)Therefore, little progress has been made in the study of
CD8-expressing cytotoxic CD4 T cells in terms of lineage reprogramming despite their
existence in the gut and other tissues during viral infection. Recently, two
groundbreaking studies bring a new concept of plasticity of mature CD4 T cell
development, revealing that CD4 T cells can reprogram to cytotoxic CD8 lineage-like
cells, CD4CD8αα T cells, in the small intestine in response to cognate
antigens by losing their ThPOK expression, which is mediated by Runx3 up-regulation
in the specific gut environment (5, 6)

Mucida et al.
(5) found that CD4CD8αα DP IELs,
the most observed cytotoxic CD4 T cells, lack ThPOK expression, which is normally
expressed high in the conventional CD4 T cells in the periphery. Concomitantly, DP
IELs display cytotoxic phenotypes like CD8αβ CTLs, including high
expression of granzyme B and the activation-induced degranulation marker CD107a. By
using well-designed fate-mapping mouse model, they showed that these cells are
derived from ThPOK+ CD4 T cells, which lose their ThPOK expression after
activation in the periphery and migration into the gut. In line with this, the
development of cytotoxic CD4CD8αα IELs are significantly hampered in mice
with germline deletion of ThPOK silencer or mice deficient for the
zinc-finger transcription factor MAZR that activates the
ThPOK silencer. This indicates that reactivation of
ThPOK silencer thereby terminating ThPOK post-thymically is
essential for the differentiation of DP IELs and their CTL program.

Reis et al.
(6) further revealed that loss of ThPOK is
initiated by Runx3 expression. By using knock-in reporter mice for Th-POK and Runx3,
they observed that expression of CD8αα on CD4 IELs is directly associated
with the high expression of Runx3, normally repressed in conventional CD4 T cells in
the periphery. Runx3hi CD4 IELs have a very low level of ThPOK expression
and other T helper genes, but have increased expression of CTL lineage genes.
TGF-β and RA are the environmental cues in the intestine to induce Runx3 and
CD8αα while down-regulating ThPOK, as evidenced by in
vitro and in vivo experimental settings using mice
deficient for TGF-β and RA signaling. Commensal microorganisms in the intestine
are also directly or indirectly involved in cytotoxic DP IEL development, since DP
ILEs are absent in the germ-free animals (5). Remarkably, the presence of Runx3hiThPOKhi CD4 T
cells, but not Runx3loThPOKlo cells, indicates that Runx3
induction precedes the down-regulation of ThPOK (6). Indeed, mice with a conditional deletion of Runx3 in T cells fail
to down-regulate ThPOK expression in CD4 IELs, thereby exhibiting reduced frequency
of CD4 IELs expressing CD8αα, CD103 and CTL genes. Overall, upon migration
of CD4 T cells to the intestine, Runx3 is up-regulated within the gut environment,
which in turn down-regulates ThPOK, promoting cytotoxic CD4CD8αα DP IEL
development.

T-bet AS A SWITCH FOR CD4CD8αα IEL DEVELOMENT
Subsequently, Reis et al.
(50) also reported that transcription
factor, T-bet (T-box expressed in T cells), is a critical upstream regulator of
Runx3 and ThPOK in the development of cytotoxic CD4CD8αα DP IELs. T-bet is
a well-known transcription factor for Th1 differentiation and CD8 T cells for their
IFN-γ production, whereas inhibiting the development of other T helper
subtypes. They found that the expression of Tbx21 encoding T-bet is
up-regulated in ThPOKlo IELs, and DP IEL differentiation is impaired in
T-bet-deficient CD4 T cells, comparable to Runx3−/− CD4 T
cells. In the presence of gut microenvironmental cues, such as TGF-β and RA,
and T-bet inducing cytokines in the intestinal milieu, such as IFN-γ or IL-27,
preferentially induce cytotoxic CD4CD8αα DP IEL differentiation by
inducing Runx3 and suppressing ThPOK expression. Notably, these combinations
suppress TGF-β/RA-mediated Foxp3 induction and T-bet-mediated Th1
differentiation, suggesting a distinct role of T-bet in the CD4CD8αα DP
IEL development.

Interestingly, overexpression of T-bet in the absence of Runx3 suppresses Th17
differentiation, and T-bet prevents Foxp3 induction regardless of Runx3 expression,
suggesting that T-bet inhibits other CD4 T cell subsets in a Runx3-independent
manner. A series of experiments using genetically modified CD4 T cells as well as
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis indicate that T-bet directly binds to
the -39 kb and the -17 kb Runx3 regulatory elements and induces
Runx3 expression. T-bet also binds to ThPOK regulatory binding
sites to down-modulate ThPOK expression in a Runx3-dependent manner. Collectively,
this study suggests that T-bet that is induced by gut environmental factors serves
as an upstream regulator for Runx3 induction thereby promoting CD4CD8αα DP
IEL development. Yet once Runx3 expression is induced, T-bet and Runx3 have
complementary roles in ThPOK down-regulation and cytotoxic DP IEL generation (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Transcriptional regulation in the development of CD4CD8αα DP
IEL. Runx3, known as a key transcription factor for CD8 T cell lineage,
which are normally repressed in conventional CD4 T cells, can be reactivated
in peripheral CD4 T cells by gut environmental factors including TGF-β
and RA and T-bet. Runx3 repressess ThPOK, a transcription factor for CD4 T
cell lineage, through direct binding to ThPOK silencer elements, thereby
promoting CD8αα and CD103 expression and CTL-associated gene
program in the CD4 T cells.
FUNCTIONS OF CD4CD8αα IELS
Although DP IELs are equipped with cytotoxic properties since their development, DP
IELs do not exert CTL function immediately and instead stay immunologically
quiescent at steady state. Antigen-specific CD4CD8αα DP IELs, as generated
by transferring OVA-specific OT-II cells into immunodeficient recipients following
OVA-feeding, remain immunologically inactive even in the continuous presence of
cognate dietary antigens, though they possess cytotoxic potential (5). This indicates that DP IELs are
“activated yet resting” like other IEL subsets, which is confirmed by
increased uptake of thymidine analog BrdU and week signals of cell-cycle marker Ki67
(5).

Upon exposure to inflammatory IL-15 with cognate antigens, however, diet-induced DP
IELs become immunologically active, producing great amounts of IFN-γ and TNF
and up-regulation of CD107a expression, implying the pathogenic potential of
cytotoxic DP IELs (5). On the other hand,
Reis et al. showed the plasticity of CD4CD8αα T cells in
their functional aspects (6). In a T
cell-transfer model of colitis, ThPOK deletion in CD4 T cells, which enhance the
generation of CD4CD8αα T cells, coincides with reduced intestinal
inflammation, suggesting non-pathogenic function of DP IELs. In line with this, mice
receiving Runx3-deficient CD4 T cells accelerate colitis, which is associated with
reduced CD4CD8αα T cells, but increased Th17 differentiation. Mice
deficient for CD4-specific Runx3 also develop more pathogenic Th17 cells with
increased inflammation and tissue damage compared to control mice after
Citrobacter rodentium infection; however, they are more
efficient at clearing C. rodentium than the wild-type control (6). These results suggest that two facet of
inflammation, protection and tissue damage, can be modulated at the transcriptional
level by Runx3 and ThPOK. Further studies are needed to define the roles of
CD4CD8αα T cells during infection and disease progress.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Cytotoxic CD4 T cells have not been recognized for a long time since there is a lack
of distinct functions, developmental mechanisms, and physiological relevance.
Nevertheless, cytotoxic phenotypes of CD4 T cells have been repeatedly reported in
human and rodents, mostly CD4CD8αα DP IELs in the intestine. Furthermore,
there is accumulating evidence showing the presence of cytotoxic CD4 T cell subsets
during anti-viral (38-40) and anti-tumor immune responses (51, 52). Finally,
recent elegant studies provide us unequivocal answers for the cytotoxic CD4 T cells
as a distinct, independent subtype of effector CD4 T cells, which are derived by the
unique modulation of transcription factors that drive their development and
functional differentiation (5-7). Although the precise role of
CD4CD8αα DP IELs and the relevance of their cytolytic phenotypes
in vivo are not understood yet, the identification of a new CD4
subset and novel developmental program will improve our understanding on the
functional differentiation of effector T cells. New insights gained from these
studies will contribute to the identification of new targets for the design of new
therapies to prevent and cure infection and diseases.
