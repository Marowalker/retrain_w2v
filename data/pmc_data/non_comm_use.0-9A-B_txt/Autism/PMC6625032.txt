it is unknown whether this is also true for intellectually advanced adults with
autism spectrum disorder. The aim of this study was to examine whether college
students with autism spectrum disorder experience difficulties with empathy and
alexithymia, and whether this is associated with their cognitive levels of
executive functioning. In total, 53 college students with autism spectrum
disorder were compared to a gender-matched group of 29 neurotypical students on
cognitive and affective dimensions of empathy and alexithymia. In addition,
cognitive performance on executive functioning was measured with computerized
and paper-and-pencil tasks. The autism spectrum disorder group scored
significantly lower on cognitive empathy and higher on cognitive alexithymia
(both d = 0.65). The difference on cognitive empathy also
remained significant after controlling for levels of cognitive alexithymia.
There were no group differences on affective empathy and alexithymia. No
significant relations between executive functioning and cognitive alexithymia or
cognitive empathy were detected. Together, these findings suggest that
intellectually advanced individuals with autism spectrum disorder experience
serious impairments in the cognitive processing of social–emotional information.
However, these impairments cannot be attributed to individual levels of
cognitive executive functioning.

==== Body
While stereotypically a lack of empathy is considered a core feature of autism spectrum
disorders (ASDs), the research literature is far more nuanced and does not support this
blanket statement. Although there is no universal agreement on its definition, empathy
is commonly assumed to include both a cognitive component of recognizing and
understanding the emotions of others and an affective component of emotionally reacting
to these emotions in an appropriate manner (Davis, 1983; Decety, 2011). The terms cognitive empathy and
theory of mind are often used interchangeably and arguably represent more or less
similar constructs (Blair,
2005; Leiberg and Anders,
2006; Mathersul et al.,
2013; Rogers et al.,
2007; Shamay-Tsoory,
2011). Impairments in empathy have been reported in both children and adults
with ASD (Auyeung et al.,
2009; Sucksmith et al.,
2013), as well as for ASD individuals with high levels of intelligence (IQ;
Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright,
2004; Lombardo et al.,
2007).

Interestingly, the empathy imbalance hypothesis (EIH) of autism (Smith, 2009) suggests that, instead of a global
empathy deficit, only cognitive empathy is compromised in individuals with ASD and the
capacity for affective empathy is heightened, as indicated by hyperarousal in response
to emotional cues by others, such as fearful facial expressions (Lassalle et al., 2017). A specific deficit in
cognitive empathy has been supported recurrently by studies in individuals with ASD,
with and without high IQ (Bellebaum
et al., 2014; Dziobek et
al., 2008; Frith,
2001; Lockwood et al.,
2013; Pouw et al.,
2013; Rogers et al.,
2007). However, regarding affective empathy, the EIH has received fewer
direct support so far, with some studies even suggesting a slightly decreased capacity
for affective empathy in ASD as well (Mathersul et al., 2013; Rogers et al., 2007; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2002). Therefore, the
most consistent evidence on empathy deficits in ASD to date suggests that it is mostly
restricted to reduced cognitive empathy compared to neurotypical individuals.

It has been suggested that empathy deficits in individuals with ASD can partially be
explained by the co-occurrence of alexithymia (Bird and Cook, 2013; Bird et al., 2010; Lassalle et al., 2018). This condition is
characterized by impairments in experiencing and verbalizing one’s own emotions and
feelings (Hill et al., 2004;
Stephenson, 1996) and
differs from empathy in that it is more centered around one’s own emotional state
instead of emotions in others. Indeed, the prevalence of alexithymia has been reported
to be nearly as high as 50% in the ASD population (Hill et al., 2004), while it is only estimated
at 13% in the general population (Salminen et al., 1999). Like empathy, alexithymia consists of a cognitive
and affective component (Vorst and
Bermond, 2001). Cognitive alexithymia involves difficulties in identifying,
verbalizing, and analyzing emotions, whereas affective alexithymia involves problems in
experiencing emotional arousal and fantasizing (Bermond et al., 2007). Studies that have
differentiated between the affective and cognitive domains of alexithymia have shown
that elevated levels of alexithymic traits are found in individuals with ASD,
predominantly in the cognitive domain (Berthoz and Hill, 2005; Ketelaars et al., 2016). This pattern has also
been identified in college students with ASD (Dijkhuis et al., 2017). The comorbidity between
ASD and alexithymia is therefore suggested to be specific for the alexithymia II
subtype, which is characterized by a deficit in the cognitive domain without impairments
in the affective domain (Bermond,
1997).

As follows from the introduction above, the constructs of empathy and alexithymia are
theoretically linked since both definitions involve cognitive processes of understanding
and reacting to emotions. Accordingly, Bird et al. (2010) found no impairment in
empathy in individuals with ASD and high IQ after controlling for alexithymia. In
contrast, other studies have found that alexithymia had no effect on empathy in
individuals with ASD and high IQ (Fan et al., 2013) and could not explain the reduced levels of cognitive
empathy and theory of mind deficits in individuals with ASD traits and high IQ (Gökçen et al., 2016; Lockwood et al., 2013).
Therefore, it is currently unclear to what extent reduced (cognitive) empathy can be
explained by the presence of alexithymic traits in ASD.

Problems within the cognitive dimension of empathy and alexithymia may partially be
explained by cognitive (dys)functions within the executive domain, which regulate
relevant thought processes. Executive functions (EF) such as response inhibition,
working memory/updating, mental flexibility/shifting, and planning/organizing are
commonly investigated in ASD and often reported to be deficient, although findings are
mixed (Demetriou et al.,
2018), especially when matched for IQ with a neurotypical group (Wallace et al., 2016). The link
between EF and cognitive empathy is largely supported by studies focusing on
operationalizations of theory of mind rather than empathy per se. Despite the limited
added value of EF deficits for differential diagnostics, many associations between
executive dysfunction and poor theory of mind skills have been found in children and
adolescents with ASD, as well as non-clinical populations with elevated levels of autism
traits (Gökçen et al., 2016;
Ozonoff et al., 1991;
Pellicano, 2007).

Regarding the compositional nature of EF, reasonable support for relations between theory
of mind, on one hand, and inhibition, mental flexibility, and planning, on the other,
has been reported for individuals with and without ASD (Ahmed and Miller, 2011; Austin et al., 2014; Carlson and Moses, 2001; Gökçen et al., 2016; Grattan and Eslinger, 1989; Hughes, 1996, 1998; Joseph and Tager-Flusberg, 2004; Müller et al., 2012; Mutter et al., 2006; Pellicano, 2007; Perner et al., 2002; Vetter et al., 2013). These
associations tend to show a uniform direction: higher levels of EF are related to better
theory of mind abilities. Results on the relation between theory of mind and working
memory in individuals with and without ASD are more inconsistent (Austin et al., 2014; Hughes, 1998; Joseph and Tager-Flusberg, 2004; Müller et al., 2012; Mutter et al., 2006; Vetter et al., 2013). There is
also some evidence from longitudinal studies in children with and without ASD that EF
components can predict abilities in theory of mind, albeit with mixed results for the
different components (Austin et al.,
2014; Hughes and Ensor,
2007; Müller et al.,
2012; Pellicano,
2010). However, these studies are partially restricted by not including
multiple EF components simultaneously. Moreover, few direct comparisons have been made
between individuals with and without ASD.

In contrast to cognitive empathy/theory of mind, associations between EF and cognitive
alexithymia have received little attention. In various clinical samples (traumatic brain
injury, HIV), studies have shown inconsistent results (Bogdanova et al., 2010; Henry et al., 2006). However, in non-clinical
samples with varying levels of alexithymic traits, relations between (cognitive)
alexithymia and impairments in inhibition, working memory, mental flexibility, and
planning have been observed (Koven
and Thomas, 2010; Xiong-Zhao et al., 2006). Furthermore, Santorelli and Ready (2015) reported that an EF
composite score was related to cognitive alexithymia in older adults. Therefore,
although there appears to be some support for the notion that EF and cognitive
alexithymia are related, it is unclear whether these findings can be extended to the
autism spectrum.

The primary aim of this study is to examine cognitive and affective alexithymic traits
and empathy in college students with and without ASD. It is hypothesized that compared
to typically developing individuals, ASD individuals will display (1) higher levels of
cognitive, but not affective, alexithymic traits, and (2) lower levels of cognitive, but
not affective empathy. Moreover, we expect that (3) more problems within the cognitive
domains are associated with autism symptom severity. We explore whether the difference
in cognitive empathy is robust against controlling for cognitive alexithymia, as there
is limited and conflicting evidence concerning this matter.

The second objective of this study is to examine relations between executive functioning
(EF) (working memory, inhibition, mental flexibility, and planning) and deviations in
empathy and alexithymia in ASD. It is expected that (4) better performance on all four
executive functioning skills is related to fewer cognitive alexithymic traits and (5)
higher levels of cognitive empathy.

Methods
Participants
All participants were post-secondary students enrolled in Dutch university
programs or at universities of higher vocational education in the Netherlands.
ASD participants were recruited through Stumass, a non-profit organization that
provides assisted living facilities to students in higher education with a
diagnosis within the autism spectrum. Stumass houses are located in 18 different
cities nationwide. In order to be enrolled into Stumass, students are required
to have received a formal clinical diagnosis of ASD based on the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
criteria (version dependent on what was customary at the time of referral) and a
formal referral for supported living from a mental health specialist. An
additional requirement for enrollment in Stumass is that psychiatric
comorbidity, if present at entry, is considered either in remission or of
minimal impact on global daily functioning of the student. Neurotypical students
were recruited through information brochures and an online student recruitment
platform at Leiden University. A concerted effort was made to recruit across
different faculties to better match the academic profile of Stumass students.
Participants in the control group filled out a customized screening
questionnaire consisting of a list of yes/no questions to exclude the presence
of psychopathology (including ASD). Furthermore, all participants were required
to be 18 years or older and fluent in Dutch. This study was part of a larger
longitudinal research project on determinants of quality of life in students
with ASD. The project was funded by the Stumass foundation and approved by the
Medical Ethics Committee of Leiden University Medical Center.

A total of 89 participants (54 ASD, 35 controls) were initially recruited.
However, six controls were excluded because they reported being diagnosed with
psychopathology (three with ASD, two with attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder, one with depressive disorder). Controls were a priori matched for sex
by including approximately one female control student for every three control
males. The age of the total participant group ranged from 18.3 to 28.1 years
old.

Measures
Intelligence
IQ levels were estimated with the Vocabulary and Block Design subtests of the
Dutch version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Fourth Edition (V-BD;
Wechsler,
2012). IQ estimation was based on a long-standing method in the
short-form literature with the formula [3 × (sum of normed scores) + 40]
(Tellegen and
Briggs, 1967). The V-BD short form correlates highly with the
full-scale IQ score of the WAIS-IV and is considered a valid estimation of
intelligence, with good reliability and validity in both clinical and
non-clinical populations (Girard et al., 2015).

Autism traits
The Dutch self-report version of the Social Responsiveness Scale—Adult
version (SRS-A) was used to assess the level of autism traits of all
individuals. The SRS-A is a questionnaire consisting of 64 items measuring
social responsiveness with a 4-point scale (score 0–3) (Constantino and Todd,
2005). Higher scores indicate more autism traits, and scores
range from 0 to 192. The discriminant and concurrent validity of the SRS-A
are moderate to good (Bölte, 2012). The Dutch self-report version that is used in this
study has excellent psychometric properties with high test–retest
reliability (r = 0.88) and a high internal consistency
(Cronbach’s α = 0.95) (Noens et al.,
2012).

Empathy
Empathy was measured with the Dutch version of the Interpersonal Reactivity
Index (IRI; Davis,
1980). The IRI consists of four 7-item subscales: personal
distress (PD), empathic concern (EC), perspective taking (PT), and fantasy
(FS). To limit the influence of self-perception bias, informants (mothers)
were asked to indicate to what extent the items describe the participants on
a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = “does not describe him or her well” to
4 = “describes him or her very well.” Total scores range from 0 to 112 (max.
28 per scale), with higher scores representing more empathy. Items on the PD
and EC scales together form the affective component of empathy. The PT scale
represents the cognitive component of empathy, and the FS scale reportedly
does not seem to fit the cognitive–affective structure (De Corte et al.,
2007). Construct, convergent, and discriminant validity of the
Dutch self-report version of the IRI support its psychometric adequacy and
the internal reliabilities of the four scales are satisfactory (De Corte et al.,
2007). Informant versions await a similar evaluation. Although
psychometric properties are not known for ASD populations, the IRI has been
used among individuals with ASD multiple times (Dziobek et al., 2008; Rogers et al.,
2007).

Alexithymia
The Dutch Bermond–Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire (BVAQ; Vorst and Bermond,
2001) was assessed to measure the degree of alexithymic traits.
The BVAQ is a self-report questionnaire that consists of five 8-item
subscales: emotionalizing, fantasizing, identifying, analyzing, and
verbalizing. The answer possibilities range from 1 = “fully applicable” to
5 = “entirely not applicable.” Items are formulated either positively or
negatively, and total scores range from 40 to 200, so that higher scores
reflect more alexithymic traits. The emotionalizing and fantasizing
subscales form the affective component of alexithymia, with scores ranging
from 16 to 80. The identifying, analyzing, and verbalizing subscales form
the cognitive dimension, with scores ranging from 24 to 120. The
psychometric properties of the BVAQ in a Dutch neurotypical population
indicate that the divergent and convergent validity are satisfactory and
that the reliability parameters are good (Vorst and Bermond, 2001). For ASD,
reasonable results regarding the convergent and discriminant validity have
been reported as well, and the test–retest reliability of the total BVAQ is
considered good (Berthoz
and Hill, 2005).

Executive functioning
The measures of EF included two computerized subtests of the
Amsterdamse Neuropsychologische Taken (ANT; De Sonneville,
2005) and three subtests of the behavioral assessment of the
dysexecutive syndrome (BADS; Wilson et al., 1996). Validity
coefficients and reliability estimates of the ANT are satisfactory (De Sonneville,
2005, 2014). The ANT has been used in various clinical and non-clinical
populations, including ASD individuals with high IQ (e.g. Ziermans et al.,
2017). The concurrent and construct validity of the BADS and its
subtests are adequate, and the ecological validity is better than the
ecological validity of other standard EF tests (Norris and Tate, 2000). Test–retest
reliability parameters are considered inappropriate for novel
problem-solving tasks such as the BADS subtasks (Chamberlain, 2003). The instrument
has been used multiple times in ASD populations (Bramham et al., 2009; Hill and Bird,
2006).

Inhibition and mental flexibility
The Shifting Attentional Set-Visual (SSV) subtest of the ANT measures
both inhibition and mental flexibility. Briefly, this task consists of
three conditions in which the participant is subsequently asked to
follow the movement of a green square (condition 1: compatible
response), a red square (condition 2–inhibition: incompatible response)
or both (condition 3–shifiting: compatible/incompatible response) on a
horizontal bar consisting of nine squares. Speed (reaction time) and
accuracy (% errors) parameters were calculated to operationalize
inhibition and mental flexibility (for a more detailed description, see
the work by Ziermans
et al. (2017)).

Working memory
The Spatial Temporal Span (STS) subtest of the ANT is designed to measure
working memory, using squares in a 3 × 3 visual spatial grid. These
squares are pointed out by a hand animation in a specific order, with
increasing complexity. The number of correctly identified targets in the
right order in the backward condition of the task constitutes the
working memory parameter for this study (for a more detailed
description, see the work by Ziermans et al. (2017)).

Planning
Three subtests from the BADS were administered to measure the ability to
plan and organize: the Key Search task (KS), the Zoo Map task (ZM), and
the Modified Six Elements task (SE). For brevity, we referred to Wilson et al.
(1996) and Hill and Bird (2006) for a
detailed description of the task content. Raw scores on each of the BADS
tasks are transformed into profile scores, ranging from 0 to 4 for each
task.

Procedure
The assessment of EF was part of a testing protocol that lasted approximately 3 h
in total. Informed consent forms were signed before the start of the assessment.
The cognitive part (≈90 min), including the BADS, the ANT, and the abbreviated
WAIS, was always administered first. The BADS was administered by the
experimenter on paper, whereas the ANT was administered on a laptop computer. At
the end of the session, participants were debriefed and received a voucher of
€20 for their participation in the study. In addition, students were asked to
fill out online questionnaires afterwards. Participants received an e-mail with
a link to the questionnaires so that they could answer them at home at their own
convenience. The SRS-A and the BVAQ were among the included questionnaires. In
addition, participants were asked permission to invite their mothers to fill in
separate online questionnaires, including the IRI.

Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS software. Data were first checked for
outliers and missing values. For group characteristics, extreme outliers
(M ± 3 SD; numerical data only) were removed for any further analyses. Extreme
outliers on cognitive test or outcome variables were excluded listwise per
analysis. Missing values were tested for randomness with Little’s MCAR (Missing
Completely At Random) test. Multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE;
Azur et al., 2011)
was applied for multivariate missing data with the predictive mean matching
approach for non-normally distributed data (Van Ginkel and Kroonenberg, 2014)

Group characteristics were tested for differences with chi-square tests (sex) and
independent samples t tests (age, IQ). Next, group differences
for alexithymia and empathy were tested with independent samples
t tests. Significant differences were subsequently
investigated for correlations with autism symptom severity. Results were based
on pooled statistics generated by SPSS (version 24). Cohen’s d
was calculated as an effect size for group differences (Cohen, 1998). Next, the level of
cognitive empathy was analyzed as the dependent variable in an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA), with group (ASD and comparison group) as independent
variable and cognitive alexithymia as a covariate. Pooled statistics for ANCOVA
were generated with syntax provided by Van Ginkel and Kroonenberg (2014).

To test for associations between EF variables and cognitive alexithymia/empathy,
pooled Pearson correlation coefficients (or Spearman, in case of non-normality)
were generated: first for the total sample and then for the ASD and comparison
group individually. To improve reproducibility and reduce the chance of Type I
error, a p value of <0.005 for new discoveries has recently
been recommended (Benjamin et
al., 2018). However, in light of the partially confirmatory nature of
our research questions, significance level was set at
α = 0.01.

Results
Group characteristics
One ASD individual was excluded for analysis due to an estimated IQ score of
>3 SD below the mean (IQ = 73). The final sample for analyses therefore
consisted of 82 participants: 53 ASD, 29 controls. Table 1 displays the characteristics of
both groups. Age differed significantly between groups
(U = 366.5, p < 0.001), with participants
in the ASD group being on average 2 years older than individuals in the
comparison group. The mean difference in estimated IQ was also significant
between groups (t(80) = 3.83, p < 0.001),
with higher scores for the ASD group than for the comparison group. Furthermore,
ASD participants reported significantly more autistic traits than comparisons
(U = 182.0, p < 0.001). Regarding
medication use, 19 ASD participants (36%) used at least one type of psychotropic
medication (antidepressants, stimulants, or antipsychotics) of whom seven (13%)
used two or more. Comparisons did not use psychotropic medication.

Group differences in alexithymia and empathy and correlation with autistic
traits
Missing value analysis showed there was a large proportion of missing data for
the IRI parent report (52%) due to unresponsiveness and to a lesser extent for
BVAQ (7%). The pattern of missing values was random, based on Little’s MCAR
test, and MICE was used to generate a recommended number of 40 imputed data sets
(Graham et al.,
2007) for subsequent pooled statistics. Because age and estimated IQ
differed between groups, linear associations with dependent variables were
checked with correlations to determine whether group comparisons needed to be
controlled for these potential confounders. However, no significant correlations
were detected.

Alexithymia
The difference in cognitive alexithymia between the ASD group and the control
group was significant (t(8004) = 2.82,
p = 0.005), with higher scores for the ASD group
(M = 69.45, SD = 15.59) than the control group (M = 59.31, SD = 15.34), and
a medium effect size (d = 0.65) according to Cohen’s (1998)
interpretation. The differences in affective alexithymia
(p = 0.08, d = 0.40) and total alexithymia
(p = 0.14, d = 0.35) were not
significant.

Explorative analyses of group differences on subscales of the two BVAQ
dimensions revealed significantly higher scores in the ASD group for the
cognitive subscales verbalizing (t(3796) = 2.63,
p = 0.009, d = 0.61) and (at trend
level) identifying (t(5839) = 2.52,
p = 0.012, d = 0.60), but not for
analyzing (p = 0.14, d = 0.34). For the
affective dimension both subscales, fantasizing (p = 0.08,
d = 0.41) and emotionalizing
(p = 0.50, d = 0.15), did not differ
between groups. The mean scores and standard deviations of the ASD and
control group on all BVAQ variables are shown in Table 2. In addition, to
investigate potential sex differences within the ASD group, direct
comparisons did not suggest that males and females differed significantly on
cognitive (p = 0.41), affective
(p = 0.25), or total alexithymia
(p = 0.19) scores.

Empathy
The difference in cognitive empathy between the control group and the ASD
group was significant (t(881) = −2.72,
p = < 0.001), with higher scores for the control group
(M = 13.03, SD = 4.43) than the ASD group (M = 9.88,
SD = 5.11) and a medium effect size
(d = 0.65). Furthermore, the group effect on cognitive
empathy remained significant (F(1, 61) = 7.20,
p = 0.009) when cognitive alexithymia was included as a
covariate in the ANCOVA analysis (see Table 3). The group differences in
affective empathy (p = 0.16, d = 0.33) and
total empathy (p = 0.47, d = 0.17) were
not significant.

Exploratively, the subscales of the IRI revealed that in addition to the PT
subscale (= cognitive alexithymia), there were also significant,
bi-directional group differences within the affective dimension. The
subscale results indicated higher levels of PD
(t(1129) = −3.89, p = < 0.001,
d = 0.85) and lower levels of EC for others
(t(1789.19) = 2.10, p = 0.007,
d = 0.51) in the ASD group compared to the controls.
The group difference on the FS subscale was not significant
(p = 0.71). The mean scores and standard deviations of
the ASD and control group on the IRI variables are included in Table 2. Finally,
direct comparisons were not suggestive of significant sex differences within
the ASD group on cognitive (p = 0.93), affective
(p = 0.36), or total empathy
(p = 0.86) scores.

Autistic traits
Autistic traits correlated positively with cognitive alexithymia, for the
total group (ρ = 0.61, p < 0.001), for
ASD alone (ρ = 0.55, p < 0.001) and at
trend level for controls (ρ = 0.48, p = 0.
013). For all associations, autism symptom severity was moderately related
to higher levels of cognitive alexithymia. Figure 1 illustrates a scatterplot of
the raw data for the total group. At a subscale level, correlations with
verbalizing and identifying were examined. Both were significantly
correlated with autistic traits for the total group (respectively,
ρ = 0.48, p < 0.001 and
ρ = 0.58, p < 0.001). However, when
the data were split by group, only the ASD group showed significant
correlations for verbalizing (ρ = 0.38,
p < 0.001) and identifying in particular
(ρ = 0.62, p < 0.001). There were
no significant correlations of autistic traits with cognitive or (subscales
of) affective empathy.

Figure 1. Correlation plot and raw data distributions for autistic traits
(SRS-A; X-axis) and cognitive alexithymia (BVAQ; Y-axis) across
groups (N = 74). The plot shows that more autistic traits are
related to higher levels of cognitive alexithymia.

Correlations of EF with cognitive alexithymia and cognitive empathy
Correlation coefficients based on pooled statistics are summarized in Table 4. None of the
EF performance measures correlated significantly with cognitive alexithymia or
cognitive empathy. Results for the control and ASD group separately also yielded
no significant results. Because cognitive performance may have been influenced
by medication use, analyses were performed an additional time without medicated
ASD individuals, but this did not change the outcome in terms of significant
correlations.

Discussion
This study investigated whether problems with empathy and alexithymia are
characteristic of intellectually advanced college students with ASD and whether
these problems are associated with EF. As expected, college students with ASD
exhibited more alexithymic traits in the cognitive domain and lower levels of
cognitive empathy compared to neurotypical college students. Moreover, the group
difference in cognitive empathy remained significant after controlling for cognitive
alexithymia. In addition, more autism traits were related to more alexithymic traits
in the cognitive domain. Contrary to our hypothesis, no significant associations
between EF and cognitive alexithymia/empathy were present.

The elevated levels of cognitive alexithymia in the current sample, in the absence of
affective alexithymia, provide strong support for the suggestion that the
alexithymic profile in individuals with ASD and high IQ resembles the alexithymia II
subtype (Bermond, 1997).
This arguably reflects that these individuals with ASD tend to focus more on
external events rather than formulating and thinking about their internal emotional
experiences (Hill et al.,
2004). The finding is also in agreement with prior studies in adults with
ASD (Berthoz and Hill,
2005), women with ASD (Ketelaars et al., 2016), and a highly
comparable sample of Dutch college students with ASD (Dijkhuis et al., 2017). In fact, this study
replicates these previous findings in an independent cohort on a subscale level, as
both studies report the largest effect sizes for the identifying and verbalizing
subscales and non-significant results for the others. On a dimensional level, the
relation between cognitive alexithymia and the autistic phenotype appears to be
independent of diagnosis, as autism symptoms were positively related for the whole
group and both groups separately (trend level for controls). However, when zooming
in on cognitive subdomains, only individuals with ASD displayed significant positive
associations with verbalizing and identifying, suggesting increased diagnostic
specificity for these subscales.

Our finding that college students with ASD also showed lower levels of cognitive
empathy than neurotypical students is in agreement with the first part of the EIH:
Individuals with ASD have a specific impairment in cognitive empathy (Smith, 2009). The second
part of the EIH, that is, the notion that individuals with ASD have a heightened
capacity for affective empathy, is not unequivocally supported by our findings, as
previously also reported for children and adults with ASD and high IQ (Dziobek et al., 2008; Pouw et al., 2013).
However, on a subscale level, we observed bi-directional effects for ASD
individuals, with elevated scores on the PD subscale and lower levels of EC compared
to controls. This is strikingly similar to findings in adults with Asperger syndrome
with the IRI by Rogers et al.
(2007), which was interpreted by authors as evidence for empathic
overarousal and greater empathy in ASD, and therefore in line with the second part
of the EIH. Together, both findings suggest that individuals with ASD experience
more self-oriented affective responses in a social context (e.g. feeling hopeless or
incompetent in reaction to other people’s suffering), but less other-oriented
affective responses (e.g. a desire to ease the other person’s suffering). It should
be noted, however, that the current results are based solely on parent report
(exclusively mothers). A previous study on self-report and parent report of empathy
in youths with ASD and controls showed a clear discrepancy in perception of empathic
capacity in ASD dyads which was not present in control dyads (Johnson et al., 2009). ASD youths rated
themselves significantly higher on empathic features than their parents did.
However, based on this finding, it cannot be determined whether parent reports are
perhaps biased in the opposite direction. Including self-report simultaneously would
therefore provide a more balanced and detailed picture of the empathic capacities of
college students with ASD.

Although the present findings lend support for the EIH, our results oppose the
hypothesis posited by Bird et
al. (2010) that alexithymia can help explain difficulties with empathy in
ASD. Here, cognitive empathy was still significantly impaired after controlling for
the variance in cognitive alexithymia. Methodological differences may account for
these seemingly contradictive findings. For example, although Bird et al. (2010) measured cognitive
alexithymia with a similar questionnaire (TAS-20), the assessment of empathy
consisted of brain responses in reaction to viewing the hand of a familiar other on
which an electric shock was applied. It could be argued that these reactions reflect
a different, more subconscious level of empathy (i.e. physiological) than the
informant reports used in our study. This notion is strengthened by two other ASD
studies which applied behavioral theory of mind tasks to measure cognitive empathy
and with which our results are more consistent (Gökçen et al., 2016; Lockwood et al., 2013).

Contrary to our expectations, no significant correlations were detected between the
performance-based measures of EF and cognitive alexithymia/empathy. The
domain-general theory of executive dysfunction has been one of the major cognitive
theories that addresses social and non-social behavioral problems in individuals
with ASD (Hill, 2004;
Rajendran and Mitchell,
2007). Therefore, it was hypothesized that EF performance would be
related to the cognitive dimensions of empathy/alexithymia in ASD. The absence of
correlations with EF in our comparison group is equally surprising, as it contrasts
with previous findings in non-clinical populations (e.g. Carlson et al., 2015; Koven and Thomas, 2010; Perner et al., 2002; Xiong-Zhao et al., 2006)
and the assumption that such associations exist regardless of an individual’s
position within the spectrum. Especially for cognitive empathy, often used
synonymously with theory of mind, we have argued that there is compelling evidence
for positive associations with different EFs. Despite these previous findings, it is
conceivable that our null findings can in part be attributed to the choice of
performance-based measures for EF. It is well documented that such measures
correlate low with, for example, informant-based ratings of EF (e.g. Dekker et al., 2017; Toplak et al., 2013) and
others have previously highlighted the difficulty of interpreting different types of
EF measures in ASD (Kenworthy et
al., 2008). It is also possible that some or most of these associations
do not fully capture the complex nature of the cognitive empathy concept by focusing
on theory of mind tasks. For instance, autobiographical memory is also involved in
cognitive empathy, as personal earlier experiences are used to interpret and
understand situations (Shamay-Tsoory, 2011). Future studies should therefore address to what
extent different operationalizations of cognitive empathy and theory of mind can be
used to make inferences about both constructs.

Some limitations in this study need to be addressed. First, the present sample
consists of a group of ASD individuals with above-average IQ and a moderately sized
control group, both of whom included only a small proportion of female participants,
which all narrow the generalizability of the results. Although groups were matched
for sex and direct comparisons for alexithymia/empathy in the ASD group did not
suggest any sex differences, the sample size was suboptimal to provide conclusive
results. Second, it cannot be ruled out that comorbid conditions influenced the
outcome. Data on psychiatric comorbidity were unavailable and the use of
psychotropic medication by 36% of ASD individuals suggests comorbid problems were
still present in this group, despite strict admission policies. Third, the use of
questionnaires, such as the BVAQ, always involves a risk of social desirability
(Van de Mortel, 2008)
and there was a large proportion of missing data for the IRI. However, a
sophisticated multiple imputation was used to deal adequately with this limitation
(Raghunathan et al.,
2003). Finally, a strength of this study is that both the cognitive and
affective domains of empathy and alexithymia were included as well as multiple
measures of EF.

In conclusion, this study has provided a detailed presentation of explicit problems
with cognitive alexithymia and reduced cognitive empathy in intellectually advanced
individuals with ASD. Since cognitive alexithymia and empathy are important
determinants for adequate social functioning (Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright, 2004; Vanheule et al., 2007),
training programs aimed to reduce alexithymia and improve empathy might lessen the
social problems college students with ASD experience (Adreon and Durocher, 2007; Welkowitz and Baker, 2005),
for example, with establishing peer networks, teamwork, or finding employment. In
addition, levels of alexithymia and cognitive empathy have previously been
associated with personal well-being in non-ASD populations as well (Honkalampi et al., 2000;
Shanafelt et al.,
2005), thereby further stressing their importance as viable intervention
targets. However, these types of intervention targets are unlikely to benefit from
training initiatives primarily aimed at improving EF skills. Instead, trainings
aimed at improving emotional intelligence may present an interesting alternative to
reduce traits of cognitive alexithymia (Amani et al., 2014), and to improve
cognitive empathy (Castillo et
al., 2013).
