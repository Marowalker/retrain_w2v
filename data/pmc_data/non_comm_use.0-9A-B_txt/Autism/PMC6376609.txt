occupational challenges. To date, no standardized, internationally accepted
tools exist to assess autism spectrum disorder–related functioning. World Health
Organization’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
Health can serve as foundation for developing such tools. This study aimed to
identify a comprehensive, a common brief, and three age-appropriate brief autism
spectrum disorder Core Sets. Four international preparatory studies yielded in
total 164 second-level International Classification of Functioning, Disability
and Health candidate categories. Based on this evidence, 20 international autism
spectrum disorder experts applied an established iterative decision-making
consensus process to select from the candidate categories the most relevant ones
to constitute the autism spectrum disorder Core Sets. The consensus process
generated 111 second-level International Classification of Functioning,
Disability and Health categories in the Comprehensive Core Set for autism
spectrum disorder—one body structure, 20 body functions, 59 activities and
participation categories, and 31 environmental factors. The Common Brief Core
Set comprised 60 categories, while the age-appropriate core sets included 73
categories in the preschool version (0- to 5-year-old children), 81 in the
school-age version (6- to 16-year-old children and adolescents), and 79 in the
older adolescent and adult version (⩾17-year-old individuals). The autism
spectrum disorder Core Sets mark a milestone toward the standardized assessment
of autism spectrum disorder–related functioning in educational, administrative,
clinical, and research settings.

==== Body
Introduction
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an early onset neurodevelopmental condition
characterized by altered social communication and interaction, alongside restricted
and stereotyped behaviors and interests, causing significant functional impairment
(American Psychiatric
Association (APA), 2013). The estimated prevalence of ASD is 1%–2% (Baxter et al., 2015; Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), 2016; Idring et al., 2015). Individuals with ASD
face challenges in education (Levy and Perry, 2011), employment (Howlin et al., 2013), social relationships
(Schmidt et al.,
2015), self-care (Du et
al., 2015), and domestic life (Fortuna et al., 2015). Physical (Cashin et al., 2016) and
psychiatric (Joshi et al.,
2013; Salazar et al.,
2015) comorbidity is also common in ASD, and premature death of
individuals with ASD is more likely than in the general population (Hirvikoski et al., 2016).
Moreover, life satisfaction is low in many individuals with ASD (Jonsson et al., 2017; Van Heijst and Geurts,
2015). Nevertheless, there is a considerable variation in individual levels
of functioning and consequent outcomes. Factors known to contribute to variable
outcomes in ASD include intelligence (Kirby et al., 2016), socio-demographic
background (Fountain et al.,
2012), and accessibility to services such as evidence-based treatments
(Dawson et al., 2012;
Fein et al., 2017)
and family support (Woodman et
al., 2015). While ASD has traditionally been viewed predominantly from a
phenomenological perspective, research findings endorse the necessity to appraise
ASD from a broader perspective than its current behavioral definition, taking into
account personal, social, and environmental factors of health-related functioning.
The bio-psycho-social model of the World Health Organization (WHO) International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides a comprehensive,
integrated framework for functional ability and disability to address this need
(WHO, 2001).
Complementary to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; APA, 2013) and the International
Classification of Diseases–Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (WHO, 1992), both of which classify health
conditions and focus on the biomedical elements of disability, the ICF promotes a
more holistic perspective of disability by systemizing functioning and factors that
influence everyday life outcomes (WHO, 2001). The ICF consists of two
parts—(a) functioning and disability and (b) contextual factors. Functioning and
disability take into account body functions (i.e. physiological and mental functions
of the body system), body structures (i.e. anatomical parts of the body), activities
(i.e. execution of tasks), and participation (i.e. involvement in life situations).
Contextual factors include environmental factors (i.e. factors not inherent to the
individual, for example, family, work, recreational opportunity, government
agencies, laws, societal attitudes) as well as personal factors (i.e. personal
experience, race, gender, age, educational level, coping styles). Although personal
factors are part of the ICF framework, these are currently not classified in the
nomenclature given their large cultural and social variability (WHO, 2001). All
other components of the ICF are structured into “chapters” that comprise
hierarchically organized “categories” with up to three levels of increasing detail.
This is demonstrated by an example from the body functions component in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Example of the hierarchically organized category structure of the ICF.

Since 2007, a Child and Youth version of the ICF, the ICF-CY, has been available that
additionally captures functional characteristics and environments of developing
individuals (WHO, 2007).
This version of the ICF encompasses all the categories of the reference version of
the ICF plus additional ones for children and youth, comprising 1685 categories: 531
in body functions component, 329 body structures, 552 activities and participation,
and 273 environmental factors. For the development of the ICF core sets for ASD
described here, we therefore selected to use the more comprehensive child and youth
version.

The use of ICF may foster an approach of managing ASD that emphasizes individual
abilities, disabilities, and the context that has an impact on the individual’s
functioning. This approach is potentially meaningful for several reasons (Bölte, 2009; Escorpizo et al., 2013).
First, not only is functioning often perceived as less stigmatizing than
psychopathology or diagnosis, but problems in functioning are also often the reason
for initial referral to services and focus for interventions rather than
psychopathology itself. Given this, aspects of functioning are likely to be more
tangible and meaningful than psychopathology/diagnosis to individuals with ASD,
their families, and society as a whole. Aspects of functioning are also well suited
to describe an individual’s real-life challenges and to guide individual
intervention planning (Castro
and Pinto, 2013). A functional lens may enable better calculation of
health-related service costs (Hopfe et al., 2017; Schraner et al., 2008). Finally, individual descriptions of functional
abilities and disabilities may also enhance communication between individuals on the
autism spectrum, their environment, and experts. The ICF highlights the influence of
the environment, stressing its positive and negative role in influencing outcome.
Recognizing that environmental factors influence an individual’s outcome provides an
opportunity to change those factors toward outcome improvement. It is also important
to note that the ICF offers a framework to assess strengths, rather than just
disability.

There are also some challenges to applying the ICF—particularly its continued limited
prominence and acceptance by professionals and researchers, and its exhaustive
comprehensiveness which makes it difficult and time-consuming for daily use. In
practice, only a fraction of the ICF categories is needed when evaluating
functioning of individuals with specific health conditions. To address these
concerns, the development of ICF Core Sets was initiated (Selb et al., 2015) to generate shortlists
of ICF categories pertinent to specific health conditions.

The development of ICF Core Sets involves a rigorous scientific procedure aimed at
reducing the number of ICF categories to those that are most significant for a given
condition. This procedure comprises four international, multi-perspective
preparatory studies: systematic literature review, an expert survey, a qualitative
study and a clinical study, and a multidisciplinary and expertise-based
decision-making and consensus (conference) process (Selb et al., 2015).

ICF Core Sets have been developed for diagnoses such as cerebral palsy (Schiariti et al., 2015),
depression (Cieza et al.,
2004), and bipolar disorder (Ayuso-Mateos et al., 2013), but not yet for
any DSM-5 defined neurodevelopmental disorders. For this reason, the development of
standardized ICF Core Sets for ASD (Bölte et al., 2014) has been initiated. The
objective of this article is to provide a summary of the results of the four
preparatory studies and the international consensus conference, where the first
versions of the ICF Core Sets for ASD were developed.

Method
Process
The first version of the ICF Core Sets for ASD was decided at the consensus
conference by a multi-professional and international group of participants, who
based their decision on their expertise and on evidence generated in four
preparatory studies: a systematic literature review, expert survey, qualitative
study, and clinical study. Each preparatory study produced a set of candidate
categories, that is, a selection of ICF categories that represented the
different perspectives captured in each of the studies. Throughout the
decision-making and consensus process during the conference, the participants
were reminded to consider the preparatory studies results in their discussions
and in the final decision.

Preparatory studies
The study designs and methodologies were different in each of the preparatory
studies, but candidate categories were identified similarly. After extracting
functioning concepts from the respective datasets collected in each study,
concepts were linked to the ICF categories using established ICF linking rules
(Cieza et al.,
2005) and a frequency analysis was done. The most frequently reported
categories in each study were included in the list of candidate categories for
that study. In the systematic literature review, functioning data were gathered
from 71 ASD-related outcome studies that were identified through systematic
searches on scientific databases (e.g. Medline, PubMed, CINAHL) (De Schipper et al.,
2015). The international survey of ASD experts collected the views
and opinions of 225 experts across 10 professional disciplines from 43 countries
and all WHO world regions (De Schipper et al., 2016). The qualitative study involved focus
group discussions and semi-structured interviews of individuals with ASD, family
members, and professional caregivers from 19 stakeholder groups in five
countries from five WHO world regions (Mahdi et al., 2017a). Unlike the other
preparatory studies, employing the ICF linking rules was not necessary to
identify the candidate categories in the clinical cross-sectional study (Mahdi et al., 2017b).
In this study, the extended ICF checklist that clinicians and clinical
researchers used to gather data from 122 individuals with ASD recruited at 11
clinical sites in 10 countries in four different WHO world regions already
defined an ICF category for each checklist item. A detailed description of each
study can be found in separate scientific publications. Ethical approval was
obtained for each respective preparatory study and informed consent was acquired
(both in written and verbal form) from each participant who took part in the
preparatory studies.

Consensus conference
Participants
To generate the first ICF Core Sets for ASD, international experts were
invited to participate in a 3-day iterative decision-making process at a
consensus conference that took place in Stockholm (Sweden) in September
2016. Experts had to meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible
for conference participation: (a) a professional background in childhood
disability, which included psychiatry, psychology, psychotherapy, social
work, special education, speech-language pathology, nursing, occupational
therapy, pediatrics, and physiotherapy; (b) at least 5 years of working
experience with infants, children, adolescents, or adults with ASD; and (c)
fluency in English. The nomination of experts was predominately made by the
Project Steering Committee, who were a group of key opinion leaders in the
field of ASD or experts in the ICF. The Steering Committee included
clinicians, educators, researchers, and self-advocates from all six WHO
world regions (see “Acknowledgements” and authors). To achieve a broad
representation of professional backgrounds and WHO world regions, Steering
Committee members were asked to nominate experts who matched their own
professional field and WHO world region. In total, 29 invitations were sent
to international ASD experts to participate in the consensus conference.

Procedure
The consensus conference followed an iterative standardized decision-making
and consensus (voting) process established for ICF Core Set development with
an adaptation for age-specific groupings (Figure 2) (Selb et al., 2015) and employed a
specialized data analysis program in MS Office Access. This program
displayed the candidate categories from each preparatory study, including
category descriptions and corresponding frequencies, tracked the expert
votes, and generated summary results that informed the subsequent steps of
the voting procedure. In accordance with previous ICF Core Set projects, a
Comprehensive and a Brief (Common) ICF Core Set were developed (Cieza et al., 2004;
Schiariti et al.,
2015). In addition, based on a decision made by the Steering
Committee, three age-specific brief sets were also developed: a preschool
set (aged 0–5 years), a school-age set (aged 6–16 years), and an older
adolescent and adult set for individuals 17 years old and older. The
iterative voting process comprised two stages which led to the development
of the comprehensive version of the ICF Core Set for ASD (Stage 1), and the
brief version (Stage 2). Stage 1 was done by alternating discussions and
voting in working group (WG) (Votes A and B) and plenary sessions (Votes C
to E).

Figure 2. The iterative decision-making process at the consensus meeting.

For the WG discussions and voting of Votes A and B, the ASD experts were
divided into three groups of six or seven participants. Participants
remained in the same WG throughout Stage 1. In the construction of the WGs,
efforts were made to ensure a balanced representation of professional
disciplines, WHO world regions, and gender. A WG leader was appointed for
each group to moderate the WG discussions and voting procedure. Each WG also
had two assistants who presented the candidate categories from the
preparatory studies, took discussion notes, and entered the voting results
in the data analysis program. The WG leader fostered discussion on the pros
and cons of including individual candidate categories, and encouraged the
experts to consider not only the preparatory study results, their own
expertise in ASD, but also country and cultural applicability. Since the WG
leader was allowed to vote, he or she was instructed to maintain objectivity
and ensure that all opinions were heard before voting. To avoid leader bias,
the WG leader was also instructed to wait with giving feedback until after
several members have already provided their comments. The voting was
conducted openly by a show of hands.

Consistent with previous ICF Core Set projects (Ayuso-Mateos et al., 2013; Schiariti et al.,
2015), consensus agreement for automatic inclusion of individual
categories in the Comprehensive Core Set for ASD in Votes A and B was set at
⩾75%, meaning that at least three-fourths of the experts had to vote in
favor of including a category for it to be part of the comprehensive set.
Categories that received 40% positive votes or fewer were directly excluded
from the comprehensive set. Individual candidate categories were considered
“ambiguous” if more than 40% but less than 75% of the experts voted to
include that category. Ambiguous categories were carried over to the next
session for re-discussion and a new voting round. Between the WG sessions
(or Votes A and B), a plenary session took place to review Vote A results
and to enable the participants to present arguments in favor of or against
the ambiguous categories. Ambiguous categories that remained after Vote B
were re-discussed in the subsequent plenary session, during which Vote C
took place. In Vote C, a majority (>50%) of the participants had to vote
to include the ambiguous category for it to be part of the Comprehensive
Core Set.

Up to this point, the categories that were already included in the
Comprehensive Core Set for ASD were at the second level. In Vote D, the
experts were asked to decide whether these second-level categories were
specific enough to describe the functioning of individuals with ASD or “dive
deeper,” that is, consider replacing the second-level category with the
respective third- or fourth-level categories for more specificity. The
latter would have taken place in Vote E. Fewer than 50% of the experts voted
for “dive deeper” (n = 16; 20%) and Vote E was therefore not used.
Completion of Stage 1 consequently led to the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for
ASD.

Stage 2 marked the development of the Brief Common Set and the three
age-specific brief sets, involving a two-round ranking and cut-off exercise
for each set. In deciding on the ranking and cut-off, the experts were
reminded that the brief sets should comprise the fewest number of categories
possible while still capturing the most essential.

In the first round of developing the Common Brief Set, each expert received a
handout with all the categories from the Comprehensive Core Set for ASD
organized according to ICF component, and were instructed to rank the top 10
most essential categories for each ICF component from 1 to 10, with “1”
being most essential. The ranking results of each expert were analyzed using
descriptive statistics and combined to generate a common ranking. After each
ranking round, the common ranking was presented and the participating
experts had the opportunity to discuss reasons for their ranking decision
and to argue for the inclusion of selected categories. The latter was
important, since they were required after both ranking rounds to choose a
cut-off, that is, the number of categories per ICF component that would be
crucial to include in the Brief Common Set. The same ranking and cut-off
procedure was repeated for each of the age-specific brief sets. However, the
starting list of categories did not include the categories of the Common
Brief Set, since these were automatically included in each of the
age-specific brief sets. Categories that were voted into all of the three
age-specific brief sets were included retrospectively in the Brief Common
Set.

Results
The systematic literature review identified 80 (De Schipper et al., 2015), the
international survey 77 (De
Schipper et al., 2016), the qualitative study 110 (Mahdi et al., 2017a), and the clinical
cross-sectional study 133 second-level candidate categories (Mahdi et al., 2017b). Taken together, the
four preparatory studies identified 164 unique second-level ICF candidate
categories. The majority of the candidate categories came from the activities and
participation component (k = 78, 48%), followed by body functions (k = 43, 26%),
environmental factors (k = 39, 24%), and body structures (k = 4, 2%). Table 1 summarizes the
second-level candidate ICF categories that were identified across the four
preparatory studies.

Comprehensive ICF Core Set for individuals with ASD
Table 3 shows the
categories included in the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for ASD. Of the 164
second-level candidate categories that were identified in the preparatory
studies, 111 (68%) were included in the Comprehensive Core Set. A large majority
of the categories in the Comprehensive Core Set were from the activities and
participation component (n = 59, 53%), followed by environmental factors
(n = 31, 28%) and body functions (n = 20, 18%). Only one body structure
(structure of the brain) (1%) was included. All nine chapters from the
activities and participation component and all five chapters of the
environmental factors were represented in the Comprehensive Core Set. Most of
the body function categories were mental functions, followed by aspects of
physical and sensory functions. The three most frequently represented chapters
were b1 Mental functions (n = 15, 14%), d1 Learning and applying knowledge
(n = 15, 14%), and e5 Services, systems, and policies (n = 9, 8%).

Brief ICF Core Set for older adolescents and adults (>17 years
old)
Table 7 shows the
categories that were included in the Brief ICF Core Set for adults (>17 years
old). The experts voted to include 79 second-level ICF categories for this set.
Categories were mostly from the activities and participation component (n = 34,
43%), followed by environmental factors (n = 27, 34%) and body functions
(n = 18, 23%). Contrary to the Brief Core Sets for preschoolers and school-age
children, all nine chapters of the activities and participation component were
represented, while one of the five environmental factors chapters, that is, e2
Natural environment and human-made changes, was not covered. The three most
covered chapters were b1 Mental functions (n = 15, 19%); e5 Services, systems,
and policies (n = 9, 11%); and e3 Support and relationships (n = 8, 10%).

Discussion
The goal of the international consensus conference was to develop Comprehensive and
Brief ICF Core Sets for ASD with consideration of the evidence collected through
four international preparatory studies, that is, a systematic literature review
(De Schipper et al.,
2015), an expert survey (De Schipper et al., 2016), a qualitative
study (Mahdi et al.,
2017a), and a clinical study (Mahdi et al., 2017b). This goal was
achieved by an international and multi-professional group of experts who concluded
that the Comprehensive Core Set should highlight activities of daily living and
functioning in various environments in the determination of functioning levels. Body
functions and body structures found less resonance. The Brief Core Sets followed the
same pattern, including categories predominantly from the activities and
participation component and environmental factors. The activities and participation
categories that were identified as characteristic of individuals living with ASD
were diverse and in line with its operationalization in DSM-5 (APA, 2013), that is,
challenges in social communication and relationships (Schmidt et al., 2015) and their impact on
participation in activities of daily living from self-care (Du et al., 2015) and academic achievement
(Levy and Perry,
2011) to vocational performance (Howlin et al., 2013). Contrary to
activities and participation, the body function categories were less heterogeneous,
consisting mainly of (b1) mental function categories. This is consistent with the
conceptualization of ASD as a neurodevelopmental, mental, and largely cognitive
condition. Nevertheless, some physical and sensory aspects of the body were also
covered. This reflects previous findings that show that the impact of ASD extends
beyond mental functions into other body processes, such as motor coordination (Fournier et al., 2010),
hypersensitivity (Marco et al.,
2011), and speech fluency (Scaler Scott et al., 2014).

Interestingly, during the consensus conference, the experts were generally less
inclined to include body functions categories in the ASD Core Sets as compared to
activities and participation categories and environmental factors. One possible
explanation might be that since the concept of ASD has evolved within a biomedical
framework, and the defining features of ASD are already covered by ICD-10 and DSM-5,
the participating experts perhaps saw the development of ICF Core Sets for ASD as an
option of achieving a more holistic perspective, integrating personal, social, and
environmental aspects of the individual (Escorpizo et al., 2013; Hwu et al., 2001a). Indeed,
enriching the holistic perspective, a variety of environmental factors were included
in the ASD Core Sets. The role of environmental factors on individual functioning in
ASD has previously been highlighted (Dawson et al., 2012; Fein et al., 2017; Kirby et al., 2016). However, there is
still a need to understand and take into account the influence of the environment on
functional outcomes in ASD, and to prioritize interventions that allow individuals
with ASD to achieve optimal functioning in key contexts, for example, education
(Fleury et al., 2014)
and vocation (Shattuck et al.,
2012). The environmental factors included in the ASD Core Sets are well
suited to describe possible facilitators and barriers of functioning in various
environments. However, the insufficient granularity of the environmental factors or
for some insufficient comprehensiveness makes it difficult to generate information
that is directly applicable in interventions. For instance, the descriptions of e310
immediate family or e315 extended family, e330 people in positions of authority are
not detailed enough to present an accurate picture of the social supports of a
person with ASD. Furthermore, within a family, some members may be supportive while
others pose barriers. There are no clear guidelines on how to handle this with
interventions. Nevertheless, adequately appreciating the role of environmental
factors, such as involvement in play and recreation, on individual functioning in
ASD is crucial to reducing barriers and promoting facilitators, and adapting
interventions to the needs of those living with ASD (Egilson et al., 2017). The ASD Core Sets
can help raise awareness about environmental factors and encourage stakeholders in
ASD to explore existing attitudes and social beliefs (Burkett et al., 2015; Ratto et al., 2016). Although symptoms of
neurodevelopmental disorders may be similar across cultures, symptom perception,
interpretation, and acceptance are not (Ravindran and Myers, 2012). With this as
well as WHO’s commitment toward internationality and cultural diversity in mind, the
process to develop the ICF Core Sets for ASD made efforts to consider cultural and
attitudinal differences. By equipping stakeholders with useful tools that explore
the attitudinal environment of individuals with ASD, they will be better able to
detect, communicate, and address barriers in the environment and reduce ASD-related
stigmatization by providing appropriate interventions and knowledge about ASD.
Despite the numerous advantages of recognizing environmental factors, these have
largely been ignored in the standardized diagnostic process of ASD. In fact, the
different diagnostic systems ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) and DSM-5 (APA, 2013) do not take
environmental factors into account at all. Remarkably, the significance of
environmental factors is often emphasized by individuals diagnosed with ASD and
their caregivers—as indicated by the qualitative study (Mahdi et al., 2017a) as compared to the
systematic literature review (De
Schipper et al., 2015) and expert survey (De Schipper et al., 2016).

There were some commonalities and differences found in the various age-specific brief
sets. Common to all age-specific brief sets was the emphasis on mental functions.
This supports the notion that ASD is a persistent neurodevelopmental condition
associated with cognitive challenges (Demetriou et al., 2017; Magiati et al., 2014).
Interestingly, sensory functions and sensory environment were not included in the
adult group. One possible explanation could be that improvements in sensory
functions and acquired strategies that have been observed in individuals with ASD as
they get older (Kern et al.,
2006) make adults with ASD less susceptible to noise, light, and other
sensory stimuli. Another explanation might be that the experts (without ASD) were
less informed about the lived experiences of adults, and perhaps an expert group of
adults with ASD would have included sensory symptoms. As the age-specific core sets
are a secondary focus to help tailor the process for particular patients, the
Comprehensive Core Set and Brief Common Set can be used for all individuals with
ASD; they provide some flexibility for individual differences within age categories.
To better understand the complex associations or lack of associations between
sensory functions and sensory environment with age as a modifier, further research
is needed—with possible consideration of the graphical modeling approach (Kalisch et al., 2010).

All age-specific brief sets contain ICF categories in the environmental factors
chapter d5 Services, systems, and policies. This demonstrates the importance of
access to support, social and health care decision-making for the well-being of
individuals along the continuum of care across the lifespan. For instance, the
transition from adolescence to adulthood poses major challenges to individuals with
ASD. To optimize functioning outcomes of individuals with ASD during major
transitional events, such as moving from home, attending university, entering the
labor market, and living an independent life (Schall et al., 2012), personal support may
be required in various areas of life (Van Schalkwyk and Volkmar, 2017).

Study limitations
There were several challenges faced in developing the ASD Core Sets that deserve
attention, most of which have been discussed in the publications on the
preparatory studies (De
Schipper et al., 2015, 2016b; Mahdi et al., 2017a, 2017b). First, although
the six WHO world regions were represented in the preparatory studies and
international consensus conference, some parts of the world were better
represented than others. This was also the case at the consensus conference,
potentially causing a risk that culture-sensitive categories were overlooked.
Having an equal representation of WHO world regions is important, as the
majority of individuals with ASD live in low- and middle-income countries,
despite the fact that almost all research on ASD focus on high-income countries
(Bölte et al.,
2016; Durkin et
al., 2015). Unfortunately, there was considerable difficulty both to
identify international experts with diverse professional backgrounds and to get
them to participate in the project. To address this issue, the conference
participants were regularly reminded to consider the applicability of the ICF
Core Sets for ASD in various parts of the world and in all resource
countries.

Second, despite efforts to achieve a broad representation of disciplines, some
professional groups may have been underrepresented. For instance, few
physiotherapists and social workers participated in the consensus conference,
and there were no nurses at all. If there would have been a stronger
representation of these professions, categories related to movement and mobility
or gastrointestinal functions may have had a higher chance to be included in the
ICF Core Sets for ASD.

Finally, while individuals with ASD and family members were involved in the
preparatory studies to capture their unique views and experiences, they were not
expressly recruited to be part of the consensus conference, limiting the extent
of desirable co-production (Bölte, 2017). However, one of the participating experts was a mother
of a child with ASD, therefore providing some direct lived experience
perspective in the final ASD Core Set decision-making process.

Applications of the ICF Core Sets for ASD
A novel and integral part of the diagnostic procedures and criteria recommended
for ASD in the upcoming International Classification of Diseases–Eleventh
Revision (ICD-11) is the use of categories from the ICF to describe the impact
of a health condition on individual functioning (Escorpizo et al., 2013). The ICF Core
Sets for ASD will guide the selection of categories used in the ICD-11 and
hereby mark a paradigm shift in the diagnostic assessment of ASD. The official
international operationalization of ASD will then not only contain a perspective
of psychopathology, but more individually tangible functioning-related health
information across disciplines in a standardized and comprehensive manner.
Another area of application may be resource allocation. As the ICF and the core
sets derived from it provide the possibility to more comprehensively describe
the individual challenges and strengths associated with ASD, they can also serve
as a guide to more personalized rather than diagnosis-based resource allocation
and reimbursement in health care and in education (Escorpizo and Stucki, 2013; Escorpizo et al., 2015;
Hopfe et al.,
2017). Finally, the ICF Core Sets for ASD enrich diagnostic
decision-making and treatment planning with a broad range of information that
considers relevant environmental factors and the specific needs of the
individual, for example, in the form of functioning profile.

To promote the use of the ASD Core Sets in these and other application areas, it
would be advisable to develop standardized user-friendly ICF Core Set-based
tools, such as a questionnaire with a scale that applies established measurement
standards, or observation schedules and interviews. The ASD Core Sets are solely
a selection of the most relevant categories of functioning and environmental
factors; practitioners who are unfamiliar with the ICF may find it easier and
more practical to use the ASD Core Sets in a form that they are familiar with,
such as a questionnaire/instrument. An example of an ICF Core Set-based
instrument is the ASAS Health Index (Kiltz et al., 2014). Another example of
a clinical and research application of ICF Core Sets to guide appropriate
measures is the ICF-based toolbox of multi-item measures for children and youth
with cerebral palsy (Schiariti et al., 2017). Beyond developing tangible tools for
clinical use and research, the use of the ICF Core Sets for ASD to help improve
service provision and support policy-making at the local, regional, and country
level is envisioned.

 The development of ICF Core Sets for ASD is a cooperative effort of the ICF Research
Branch, a partner within the WHO Collaborating Centre for the Family of
International Classifications in Germany (at DIMDI), the International Society for
Autism Research (INSAR), and the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at the
Karolinska Institutet (KIND) in Sweden. This paper recognizes the invaluable
contribution of individuals on the autism spectrum, their family members, experts,
and other stakeholders, as well as past members of the project (Elles de Schipper)
who contributed to the preparatory studies or organization and administration of the
whole ASD ICF Core Sets development; the experts who participated in the consensus
conference (Akihiro Takamatsu, Diana Lorenz, Dido Green, Hanna Alonim, James Shelly,
Lama Alohali, Linda Watson, Lino Palacios Cruz, Mareike Altgassen, Marisa Viljoen,
Martina Schabert, Mashael Alshalan, Michael Jung, Ofer Golan, Patti West-Okiri,
Peter Karlsson, Rubina Lal, Ulrika Långh, V.S. Bole, and Viviann Nordin); and the
Steering Committee (Omar Almodayfer, Judith Hollenweger, Bedirhan Üstün, and authors
P.J.d.V., M.G., J.E.R., C.S., S.S., B.T., V.W., L.Z.). We also acknowledge the
important efforts of the assistants who recorded the discussions and votes that took
place during the WG and plenary sessions of the consensus conference (Adina Iatan,
Armin Manouchehr, Charlie Åkerblom, Fanny Rohdin, Karl Lundin, and Philip Ivers
Ohlsson).
