Introduction
Autistic people are neurologically divergent, yet methods for investigating autistic
sociality tend to assume neurotypical definitions of being social. Comparative
design often results in autistic behaviour being interpreted as a deficit, rather
than a difference, from neurotypical benchmarks (Kapp et al., 2013). Likewise, ethnographic
research focuses heavily on autistic-to-neurotypical interactions which take place
against the cultural backdrop of neurotypical norms and expectations (Heasman and Gillespie,
2017; Kremer-Sadlik,
2004; Ochs,
2015). Thus a methodological and empirical gap exists in understanding
how autistic people relate to one another socially outside of conventionalised
norms, which is important given reports from autistic people on how it is easier to
relate to other autistic individuals precisely because of an absence of social
protocol (Chown, 2014;
Dekker, 1999).

We investigate interactions between 30 members of a charity supporting young autistic
adults to identify the features of neurodivergent intersubjectivity evident in
naturally occurring activities. Intersubjectivity was selected as an analytical
framework, since it is suited to investigating diverse forms of socially relating,
as evident in how autistic people relate to each other (Dant, 2015; De Jaegher et al., 2017; Samaritter and Payne,
2013). Using a systematic framework for identifying the shifting patterns of
intersubjectivity in each interaction, we sought to map within-interaction
variability and examine the features of such interactions.

Intersubjectivity, neurodivergence and autism
Intersubjectivity is the process whereby people come together to create
understanding (Gillespie and
Cornish, 2010). Building intersubjectivity depends on the social
situations, groups, norms and cultures encountered and the creative ways in
which people play with imagined perspectives and cultural resources in their
everyday sensemaking (Gillespie and Zittoun, 2010). Intersubjectivity differs from
coordination, in that coordination focuses on consensus, whereas
intersubjectivity characterises the diversity of ways people create shared
understanding. For example, an interlocutor may share information that is not
reciprocated or acknolwedged by another interlocutor in the next conversational
turn. This may be deemed a failure to coordinate but equally count as a moment
of intersubjectivity because it is an attempt to bridge ‘subjectivities’, an act
which may be reciprocated, or become useful, at a later stage of the
interaction. Thus when examining interactions, it is important to explore how
interlocutors create possiblities for coordination, even if it is not
consistently reciprocated immediately or if the process by which it is achieved
is non-conventional.

Studies of intersubjectivity in autism have been primarily based on
autistic-to-neurotypical interactions. These have highlighted difficulties such
as shared intentionality (Tomasello et al., 2005) and reciprocating non-verbal cues (García-Pérez et al.,
2007; Hobson and
Lee, 1998). However, autistic divergence from the neurotypical norm
for interacting (i.e. neurodivergent behaviour) can result in a gap in mutual
understanding which makes empathy (Milton, 2012), perspective-taking
(Heasman and Gillespie,
2017; Sheppard et
al., 2016), and social perception (Sasson et al., 2017; Sasson and Morrison,
2017) difficult for both parties. This two-way misunderstanding has
been termed the ‘double empathy problem’ (Milton, 2012), and it highlights the
dangers of interpreting neurodivergent behaviour on neurotypical terms.
Moreover, autistic interactions may be optimised differently across situations
and groups (Bottema-Beutel,
2017; Ochs et
al., 2004; Ochs
and Solomon, 2010). Thus, although autistic people experience
lifelong difficulties in social interaction, different contextual features of
interactions can help to extend or limit possibilities for intersubjectivity,
and such features need to be understood on their own terms outside of the
application of normative criteria.

Autism and video games
The aim of our study is to understand the features of neurodivergent
intersubjectivity that sustain autistic-to-autistic interactions when shared
experience, background knowledge and norms are arguably optimal. Accordingly, we
recorded video game interactions between co-present autistic members of a
charity supporting autistic adults because this was the most popular social
activity in the charity and was thus suited to studying neurodivergent
intersubjectivity on its own terms. Our overarching question is: what are the
features of neurodivergent intersubjectivity observed in autistic-to-autistic
interactions during collaborative video gaming?

Video games are popular among autistic people in general (Kuo et al., 2014; Mazurek et al., 2015) and among our
participants specifically. Video games encourage active participation in the
achievement of goals, and can be played across a variety of devices including
dedicated consoles, computers and mobile phones. Video games, like all games,
have a social basis (Gillespie et al., 2018); with sociality varying according to game
format (e.g. single player versus multiplayer), game content (abstract puzzles
versus virtual characters/terrains) and the context in which the games take
place (solitary gaming versus collaborative public gaming) (Gentile, 2011). Our
study involved players collaborating together on predominantly multiplayer games
involving virtual social worlds and characters and thus entailed a highly social
environment.

Approach of the study
Intersubjectivity covers the variety of ways of socially relating to another. For
example, it could take place across minds through language (Schegloff, 1992) and
bodies through action (Hobson and Lee, 1998); it can also be contextually shaped by the
types of activity undertaken (Linell, 2009) and occur across
different timescales (De
Jaegher et al., 2013). For the purposes of this study, we
operationalised intersubjectivity by focussing on observable coordination in
language. We reviewed existing interactional frameworks to identify the
observable properties of intersubjectivity. Since such frameworks have been
based on neurotypical interactions, our challenge was to mitigate the impact of
applying normative criteria to our data. To achieve this, we avoided
prescriptive categories (e.g. good or bad behaviour) in favour of descriptive
categories which described a within-interaction change in dynamic. For example,
our review identified three core aspects of intersubjectivity: (1) coherence
(Linell et al.,
1988; Roter and
Larson, 2002) which describes the logical alignment from one
conversational turn to the next, (2) affect (Bales, 1999; Nelson et al., 2016; Roter and Larson, 2002)
which describes the emotional harmony between turns and (3) symmetry, which
describes the alignment of conversational turns in terms of
assertiveness/submissiveness (Angus et al., 2012; Bales, 1999; Linell et al., 1988).

Our study proceeded systematically through two steps. First, we mapped out the
temporal shifts in intersubjectivity within each interaction to identify
sequences that are either consistent or fragmented in terms of coherence,
reciprocation of affect and symmetry. Second, we analysed these sequences
qualitatively to explore how social coordination is achieved, which led us to
identify two features of neurodivergent intersubjectivity.

Method
Participants
Observation took place at a charity supporting adults with autism. Available
activities included music, strategy games, art, pool, Lego and, the most
popular, video games. All 30 participants were members of the charity, had
either a confirmed diagnosis of autism (n = 24) or had been referred for
assessment by a medical professional (n = 6) and had no history of significant
verbal comprehension or intellectual challenges. Inclusion criteria was broad
due to challenges associated with consistent diagnosis (Liptak et al., 2008; Turowetz, 2015) and
extensive delay in assessment (+2 years in local area), thus participants
referred for assessment by a medical professional, but still awaiting diagnosis,
were included. Our sample included a gender bias towards males (25:5) with a
mean age of 23.6 (range: 16–34) years.

Materials
The study used a dedicated room with an Xbox One games console, two controllers
and a large LCD TV screen. Current popular games in the UK chart were made
available to the participants: Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate
(1-player), Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare (2-player),
Halo (2-player), FIFA 14 (2-player),
Forza Motorsport 5 (2-player), GTA V
(1-player) and Lego Batman 2 (2-player). For single-player
games, two participants took it in turns to control the avatar, the decision of
which occurred naturally without intervention from the researcher. In such cases
the other player provided advice and commentary in periods without the
controller. Two cameras captured (1) the participants’ activity and (2) the
video screen. All interactions were fully transcribed (see Supplementary file 1 for transcription notation).

Procedure
Ethical approval was granted by the researchers’ university and the charity where
the research was conducted. Participants were made aware of the nature of the
observation, why it was taking place and how the data would be stored,
anonymised and analysed. Details of the observation were sign-posted at the
entrance to the room with charity staff and the researcher available to answer
questions. Prior to each video-recorded interaction, the researcher ensured
participants understood the video-recording and consent criteria and made their
right to withdraw at any time clear. Initially some participants were curious
during the explanation of the study ‘about social interactions’, and discussed
the recording equipment while games were loading, which could potentially result
in altered behaviour through increased self-consciousness. However, all
participants quickly became absorbed by the activity of gaming, and their
attention very rarely returned to the recording equipment, shown by their lack
of verbal reference or visual attention (i.e. looking at the equipment).

In total, 20 sessions were recorded involving 30 participants, with 10
participants taking part in more than one session (Table 1). No session involved a
duplicated set of participants. The researcher was present in the interactions
to assist with any equipment issues and contributed to the conversation at the
beginning (during set-up) and at the end (concluding the session). The
researcher was available to answer questions when prompted by participants and
was seated adjacent to both the gamers and the TV screen out of the gamers’ line
of sight.

Process of analysis
To analyse the transcript, we operationalised a conversational turn as the period
from which a speaker initiates an utterance to when the utterance concludes and
another speaker assumes control (Sandvik et al., 2002). To understand
broad patterns of within-interaction variability, each turn was scored, on the
three dimensions of intersubjectivity, on a scale of −1 showing fragmentation
with prior turn, to +1 showing alignment (in cases of affect, harmony) with
prior turn. A score of 0 represented turns that were ambiguous, unclear, or
failed to meet any explicit criteria for coherence, affect or symmetry (see
Supplementary file 2).

We operationalised the three dimensions in the following way to understand
within-interaction variability. Coherence focussed on topicality and was scored
in terms of how a turn is part of the sequential organisation of interaction.
For example, question and answer sequences (known as adjacency pairs) would have
the answer turn scored as +1 (thus showing it is in alignment with the prior
turn), whereas interrupting to change topic would result in a turn scored as −1
(in misalignment with the prior turn).

Affect focussed on emotion displayed. Since we were examining only observable
displays of affect, many turns were ambiguous to rate (resulting in a 0 score),
thus computing alignment between turns would result in a disproportionately high
score, (i.e. consecutive zeros would count as strong alignment). We therefore
operationalised affect in terms of emotional harmony to understand
within-interaction variability. Criteria for scoring affect was very
conservative, including only clearly positive and clearly negative turns (e.g.
laughing, complimenting = positive (+) 1 scores; criticising, complaining =
negative (−1) scores).

Finally, symmetry focussed on how assertive/submissive a turn was relative to the
prior turn. Since evident in every turn, symmetry was operationalised similarly
to coherence, thus if both speakers were quiet, or both ebullient, there was
symmetry in terms of +1 scores.

Inter-rater tests were conducted with an autistic adult with a confirmed
diagnosis of Asperger’s syndrome. Two raters (who were not participants) were
first shown the application of the rating framework to a transcript, with the
researcher answering questions. One rater discontinued because they stated they
were bored with the task and did not provide any feedback about the framework. A
second rater enjoyed the task and provided feedback about the framework. The
main discussion points were how to rate very short turns which may be shaped by
the prior context. For example, “OK”, could be scored high for coherence (+1) if
the prior turn is an instruction (e.g. “we will restart”) or scored as ambiguous
(0) if the prior turn is an open question (e.g. “What track should we race on?”)
or scored as fragmented (−1) if spoken to interrupt the prior speaker and change
topic. In two separate sessions, the rater randomly selected two transcripts to
rate, completing 316 turns.

To make the interactions of comparable length, we analysed all interactions up to
the 300th turn and, after rating all turns, researcher turns were removed from
the analysis, thus capturing how autistic participants responded to any
interactions with the researcher but preventing the researcher from influencing
scores.

To build an overview of the data sample and understand how interactions compared
with each other, turns were categorised as consistent (involving +1 with no −1
scores), fragmented (involving −1 with no +1 scores) and mixed (involving +1 and
−1 scores, as well as ambiguous turns involving only 0 scores). Clusters of
three consecutive turn types highlighted areas for in-depth analysis, since
three turns is the minimum unit for co-constructing knowledge (Schegloff, 1992).

To understand within-interaction variability, we mapped interactions
longitudinally using line graphs and the ratings given for each intersubjective
dimension. Initially, this results in a noisy graph; therefore, to smooth out
noise and identify the trends, we took a moving average of each intersubjective
score. Averages of ratings for conversational turns have been used in
interaction frameworks before to benchmark performance between interactions
(Linell et al.,
1988). We used a moving average to facilitate our goal of
understanding within-interaction variability. Through trial and error, we found
that a 20-turn moving average provided an optimal resolution for identifying
overarching peaks and troughs in intersubjectivity.

Qualitative analysis proceeded by comparing consistent and fragmented clusters of
dialogue with intersubjective scores to identify ‘enabling’ moments, (i.e. an
observable increase in subsequent turns of one of the three dimensions of
intersubjectivity (coherence, affect or symmetry)). An abductive process (Tavory and Timmermans,
2014) involved iteratively exploring (Neale, 2016) the intersubjective
features that could help to explain within-interaction variability, with
clusters expanded to include relevant context. Abductive processes involve an
interpretive step guided by the surprising phenomenon observed and the
explanatory scope of subsequent hypotheses generated about the data.

Results
Mapping dimensions of intersubjectivity
Inter-rater reliability analysis using Cohen’s Kappa for each intersubjective
dimension yielded moderate to high levels of reliability (coherence = 0.592 (p
< 0.001), 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.512−0.672; affect = 0.786 (p <
0.001), 95% CI = 0.708−0.864; symmetry = 0.583 (p < 0.001), 95% CI =
0.497−0.669). Across interactions, there was a relatively stable pattern in
terms of overall percentage of turns that were either consistent (mean = 57%) or
fragmented (mean = 12%) with the prior turn (See Figure 1). All dyads successfully
coordinated during gameplay; but one dyad had an argument (interaction 4) and
another had a lack of communicative responsiveness (interaction 8).

Figure 1. Percentage of interaction involving consistent and fragmented
coordination turns.

Mean scores of dimensions of intersubjectivity showed variation within
interactions (see Table 3 standard deviations, in Supplementary file 3). Scores were based on 20-turn moving
averages, thus a mean score of +1 would indicate that dyads were in perfect
alignment, and a mean score of −1 would indicate that they were in complete
misalignment, over 20 turns. All dyads had 20 turns in which there was at least
+0.4 alignment across intersubjective dimensions, and also 20 turns in which
there was at most only +0.1 alignment across dimensions (see Table 4, in Supplementary file 3).

Autistic interactions have been characterised as overtly logical (Hermelin and O’Connor,
1985), but we also found displays of positive affect to be common
(mean across interactions = +0.24, SD = 0.54), with laughter, encouragement and
joking widespread (e.g. interaction 15). It was also possible for coordination
to involve high symmetry (mean = +0.34, SD = 0.62) despite low coherence and
affect (e.g. interaction 10), such as when players vented their frustration at
their virtual avatars.

Sequential mapping of interactions (Figure 2) highlighted two key phenomena:
(1) rapid shifting between consistent and fragmented moments and (2) divergence
between intersubjective dimensions. For instance, in Figure 2, rapid changes in consistency
reflected shifting interactional trajectories, for example prior to turn 60
symmetry is low as one player dominates dialogue but switches to being high when
two new players enter the room and introduce themselves (turns 50–100), leading
to tighter turn-taking (increasing coherence and symmetry) and politeness
scripts (increasing affect). Likewise, turns 160–185 have high affect and
symmetry but low coherence because both players are sharing stock phrases of
characters from the DC comics universe, while turns 205–220
have high coherence and symmetry because players have mutually identified a
cooperative in-game task but are criticising each other’s efforts (hence low
affect).

Figure 2. Example interaction, with 20-turn moving average of intersubjective
dimensions and 3-turn clusters of consistent and fragmented moments.

Mapping the dimensions of intersubjectivity raised questions, namely how do the
interactions lead to rapid shifting between consistent and fragmented
intersubjectivity and how is it that the three dimensions of intersubjectivity
can diverge so sharply, such as when coherence is low, but affect and symmetry
are high?

Identifying features of neurodivergent intersubjectivity
To address questions of within-interaction variability, we analysed clusters of
consistent and fragmented dialogue. An abductive process (Tavory and Timmermans, 2014) of
comparing and contrasting different clusters explored features that explained
patterns apparent in the data. Features explored included spontaneous voicing,
self-directed speech, invitations for further speech and adjacency pairs
responded/ignored. However, two features emerged as both potentially pervasive
and consequential in explaining the patterns identified: (1) a generous
assumption of common ground and (2) a low demand for coordination.

Generous assumption of common ground
The rapid shifting between consistent and fragmented turns across interactions
was associated with moments where participants made generous assumptions of
common ground. Autistic difficulties in maintaining interactional trajectory are
well documented, including low use of cooperative signals (Capps et al., 1998) and seemingly
egocentric orientated speech (Frith and De Vignemont, 2005). In our
data, we had many comparable cases of sudden and specific topic shifts. This
often manifested in moments where one player spontaneously adopted the voices of
fictional characters without signalling their origin to the other player or
following up to ensure mutual understanding (see Supplementary file 4). Such instances may result from the
potential for language to be experiential, that is, the act of speaking and
hearing words is a constituent part of experiencing an object (Sterponi et al., 2014).
Yet vocalising such perspectives assumes to some degree a level of common
ground; when the voices related to characters in the game, they were more likely
to be reciprocated (70%) than when they related to fictional characters beyond
the immediate context (52%). In our data, sometimes, these generous assumptions
of common ground could fragment coherence, but other times it could spark
creative, productive and affective passages of dialogue:Example 1.

Voicing leading to humour, interaction 02. Both participants with
confirmed diagnosis. Change in 20-turn average score between turns
93–97, coherence = −0.15, affect = +0.20 and symmetry = −0.15.



93	Daniel:	I need more knives because they are not knives ‘this is a
kni:fe’ ((Australian accent))		
94	Max:	Ha ‘no that’s a spoon’ ‘Oh you’ve played knifey spoony

95	Daniel:	Yea I love that show	←	
96	Max:	‘I like the choo choo’ ((possible parody of a train
spotter))		
97	Daniel:	(5.0) Right I’ve got to get in here		
In Example 1, Daniel and Max are playing Assassin’s Creed, and
Daniel is trying to select an optimal weapon from his arsenal. He observes his
current knife is inadequate, leading him to voice “this is a knife” (93), a
cultural reference to the film Crocodile Dundee (Cornell, 1986), where
the protagonist produces a large knife in response to being robbed. Max
recognises the reference shown by his laughter and then responds with two
further voices ‘no that’s a spoon’ ‘Oh you’ve played knifey spoony before?’ (94)
which is dialogue from The Simpsons cartoon series (Oakley et al., 1995),
where Bart goes to Australia and encounters a character parodying Crocodile
Dundee. Max assumes Daniel will understand the nested cultural reference, which
he does (95) by referring to a “show” and not a film. Thus, in this instance,
the generous assumption of common ground produces highly coherent, affective and
symmetric coordination – but without knowing the cultural references, it might
appear fragmented. In the following line however, Max continues with another
voice (96). Daniel ignores this turn, and instead refocuses their attention on
the task in hand, highlighting the varied nature of coordinating through voices
in the dialogue.

In Example 2, James and Bruce are playing Call of Duty when a
new enemy appears, a spaceship with a powerful laser.

probably best if you just come (.) down here and stand by
this entrance down here since you are that big guy (.)
’cause you really need to (.) you need an open area to be
fighting in		
Example 2 highlights how James and Bruce create new shared language to index the
ambiguous spaceship laser and the corresponding action to take. James’ initial
problematisation (92) is not responded to, as Bruce is distracted by damage to
his avatar’s health from jumping into the laser (93). James nonetheless adopts a
dramatic narrator’s voice in a second attempt to make sense of the threat (94).
Bruce reciprocates, not coherently, but stylistically through a voice which
indexes the Tron (Kushner and Lisberger, 1982) film
franchise (95). Turns 96 and 97 reciprocate understanding of the Tron reference
as players parody worshipping Tron as a god. When the spaceship appears later
(103), James identifies it using Bruce’s original Tron reference, which prompts
Bruce to provide advice based on his prior experience (105). Thus in playing
with voices, players are able to develop shared language on the basis of their
shared cultural resources which allows them to creatively index and orientate to
novel problems.

Examples 1 and 2 illustrate how a generous assumption of common ground, such as
by sharing very specific voices, can lead to rapid rapport, with very closely
aligned intersubjectivity. However, in moments when a generous assumption of
common ground does not work, it can create discoordination and appear
egocentric.

Low demand for coordination
Research on autistic interactions has highlighted disconnect in terms of
coherence (Tager-Flusberg
and Anderson, 1991), pragmatics (Baltaxe, 1977; Volden, 1997) and detecting
sociocultural cues (Kremer-Sadlik, 2004). In our data, there were many instances of
small-scale misunderstandings resulting from ignored turns, parallel dialogue
(independent conversation threads maintained over several turns) and
misinterpretations (misreading the pragmatic/emotional context of the prior
turn). However, these were not always problematic precisely because participants
demonstrated a low coordination threshold and were able to move on quickly from
disconnected and disruptive turns.

Example 3 illustrates an interaction between Billy (who is experienced at
first-person shooter games) and Susan (who is less experienced) as they play
Call of Duty. Billy is showing Susan the controls:Example 3.

48	Susan:	Ha ha sorry

((smiling))		
Example 3 illustrates a misinterpretation of pragmatics by both players. In turn
38, knowledge about how to shoot is agreed upon, but Billy later reveals his
plans to misdirect Susan (41). Susan initiates a ‘repair’ (Schegloff, 1992) because she does not
recognise that Billy’s prior turn was said in jest (42). Billy then responds to
the literal request from Susan, not recognising that she herself has
misinterpreted his joke (43). Coordinating tightly seems to be a low priority,
as illustrated in the ignored question in turn 44. Although coherence is low,
affect and symmetry are high, thus the misunderstanding leads to greater
certainty about the functions of the game controller during gameplay, as
evidenced by Susan’s first action in the game, which is to shoot Billy (turn
47).

Example 4 involves David (who has the controller) and Mark who are working
together to play Assassin’s Creed. To begin with, David, who is
more familiar with the game, is interested in how the game has developed new
features in comparison to previous games. Mark, being new to the game, is
marvelling at the graphics:Example 4.

120	Mark:	(2.0) I like really (.) yea they have put a lot of effort
into this game		
121	David:	vehicle attacks =

exactly tell it what to do (19.0) Oh god I really want to
see if I can just grapple over to there		
130	Mark:	Oh my god it makes me feel queasy (.) OH GOD		
131	David:	I never experience that with games I don’t think I get
vertigo	←	
132	Mark:	no don’t jump (.) can you imagine this on VR? You are up

133	David:	(3.0) I know I would like =		
134	Mark:	= look at my hands (.) look at my hands sweat		
135	David:	have you ever watched ‘Jack Septic Eye’?		
136	Mark:	no		
137	David:	right he plays a lot of video VR games (.) and he has this
fear of heights (.) like a proper fear of heights (.) but I
have seen him play Spider Man Homecoming or like this little
taster for it (.) and it was like really fun but he was
terrified of the swinging		
138	Mark:	was he was he genuinely?		
139	David:	yea he was genuinely terrified from it		
Example 4 shows David and Mark cooperatively turn-taking about two separate
topics (119–130). Mark is focussed on his embodied reaction to the game, his
admiration (122) turning to nausea (130), while David’s focus on relating the
game to past games (e.g. 125) develops into a concern about game controls (129).
What is striking is how there is minimal coherence up until turn 131, yet both
players are affectively engaged in expressing emotions of curiosity and
excitement (high affect and symmetry). Eventually, their intersubjectivity
becomes coherently orientated in turn 131 as David directly responds to Mark’s
observation about feeling queasy, perhaps because their dialogue has converged
around the topic of height. This initiates a sequence of reciprocated turns
(131–133, 135–139) during which new knowledge about the relationship between
vertigo and graphically intense games is established allowing the players to
build rapport. Previous studies have observed the tendency for autistic children
to drift between topics leading to ‘irrelevant’ responses (Loukusa et al., 2007). However, Example
4 highlights how this tendency is made unproblematic by the low demand for
coordination; indeed, it allows the players to build rapport and knowledge,
since they are free to drift between individual and cooperative ways of
verbalising their relationships to the situation, even if to the neurotypical
observer this process may appear disjointed to begin with.

Complimentary intersubjective features
The examples analysed here have shown how a generous assumption of common ground
and a low demand for coordination can have enabling outcomes as evidenced by
their reciprocation and development in proceeding turns. In Example 5, Daniel
and Max are interrupted by two new visitors, Graham and Alice. Graham introduces
Alice who has never met Max or Daniel before. Following the introductions,
Graham begins to initiate their exit from the room:Example 5.

Complimentary neurodivergent intersubjectivity. All participants with

74–98, coherence = +0.75, affect = +0.30 and symmetry = +0.35.



74	Graham:	Well well thank you I hope we weren’t really

75	Max:	Na its ok don’t worry about it

around or do you want to go out now that you =		
77	Alice:	= Erm I don’t mind

80	Graham:	I have pretty much just done that. But (.) I know you used
to play the violin but I (.) I mean I am not sure if you
will enjoy anything else, but =		
81	Alice:	= Not really no		
82	Max:	>GET HER A VIOLIN AND PLAY THE< HALO THEME	←	
83	Graham:	ᵒYea wellᵒ		
84	Max:	I’m not sure it’s the violin (.) or is it a cello?		
85	Alice:	I c’n (.) I can do the Skyrim theme		
86	Daniel:	Oh nice one!		
87	Max:	Nice!		
88	Daniel:	((laughter)) Very nice		
89	Max:	You have earned my respect		
90	Alice:	You guys are playing DC (.) as a Marvel fan I must
leave	←	
91	Max:	Yea this ain’t our choice I wanted to play Halo MasterChief
collection of something (.) but that would take too long to
install		
92	Alice:	I would like to point out that Batman is basically Tony
Stark who wasn’t clever enough to build himself a suit	←	
93	Daniel:	((Daniel laughs)) that sounds actually (.)
viable		
94	Max:	That’s actually true (.) although you know on Batman’s
behalf (.) I mean (.) come on he’s been around longer (.)
has accomplished more (.) of course let’s face it Iron Man
does look cooler		
95	Alice:	Very much cooler (.) Batman is a panzy		
96	Max:	Iron Man is just, it’s an >it’s an< awesome suit		
97	Alice:	Iron Man is here to chew bubble gum and kick ass and he’s
all out of bubble gum	←	
98	Max:	Yes (.) ((nods))		
In line 82, Max shouts loudly across the room at Alice (82). His instruction to
Alice disrupts the script of exiting that Graham had initiated in turn 74.
Graham’s unsure response (83) shows that he is not familiar with Max’s reference
to music within a specific game. However, Alice connects with the cultural
reference because she plays Skyrim and is thus part of the
symbolic world of console gaming (85). Revealing this, ‘I c’n do the Skyrim
theme’, creates mutually recognised common ground leading to rapport-building as
Alice takes control with a series of epigrams (90, 92 and 97) that are familiar
and appropriate within this sub-culture. Thus, the complimentary nature between
the generous assumption of common ground (i.e. Max’s very specific sub-culture
reference) and the low demand for coordination (i.e. Graham not picking up on
the common ground and neither Graham nor Alice perturbed by being shouted at)
unearths new intersubjective potential to engage socially, which otherwise would
have been undiscovered.

Discussion
This study explores autistic interactions through assessing within-interaction
variability, but before discussing its implications, we give consideration to its
methodology and limitations. We operationalised intersubjectivity in terms of
coherence, affect and symmetry; however, alternative ways of operationalising
intersubjectivity (e.g. different criteria, moving averages and interpretation of
qualitative extracts) may lead to different results. For example, explicit features
of language are only a partial window into how people relate to one another (e.g.
silences and non-verbal communication have not been considered). Undoubtedly more
features of neurodivergent intersubjectivity will be identified when studies include
additional communicative features and contexts. The methodological contribution of
this study is to show the utility of studying interactions in terms of
within-interaction variation.

A challenge faced was how to interpret neurodivergent interactions outside of
normative criteria, particularly when previous interaction frameworks are based on
neurotypical data (e.g. doctor-patient interactions). To mitigate this, we selected
only broad features of intersubjectivity, but further analyses may wish to consider
more specific criteria, such as examining the structure and quality of ‘repair
sequences’ in dialogue (Schegloff, 1992). We also conducted inter-rater reliability with an
autistic rater. The authors recommend that future studies of autistic social
interaction use autistic inter-rater reliability as a means of questioning
neurotypical assumptions that may be embedded within the research.

Our sample is not representative of the diversity of people on the spectrum, given
its gender bias, age range and focus on verbal competence, thus the findings are not
indicative of all examples of neurodivergence. Future studies should examine
neurodivergent intersubjectivity within different activities and cultures, given the
extent to which interactions are shaped by context (Gernsbacher et al., 2017). Additional
contexts will help to expand and refine the current rating framework and improve
inter-rater reliability. Moreover, research is needed to systematically compare
neurodivergent intersubjectivity with a neurotypical control group and other
neurodivergent groups to understand whether the features of neurodivergent
intersubjectivity observed here are generalisable to other contexts where
neurotypical norms for interacting are not observed.

Mapping dimensions of intersubjectivity in interactions involving neurodivergent
participants raised two questions, namely how do the observed interactions
facilitate the rapid shifting between consistent and fragmented intersubjectivity,
and how is it that the three dimensions of intersubjectivity can diverge so sharply?
(e.g. low coherence, but high affect and symmetry). We observed two features of
intersubjectivity that help to explain these phenomena.

First, a low demand for coordination could lead to fragmentation (e.g. players not
coherently aligned), but it could also ameliorate many of the challenges associated
with fragmented or potentially disruptive turns allowing players to swiftly move on
from small-scale social misunderstandings (e.g. accidental other-initiated repair in
Example 3; ignoring shouted turn in Example 5). Second, abrupt topic shifts,
particularly through perspective-playing with characters from films, TV, music and
imagined perspectives, could create new rich dialogue despite potentially
fragmenting coherence. Everyday social exchanges take place upon a foundation of
assumed common ground (Garfinkel, 1964). Indeed, intersubjectivity can never be known at the
outset; it needs to be assumed to be achieved (Rommetveit, 1976). Accordingly, the
generous assumptions of common ground made by neurodivergent participants allowed
underlying sub-cultures to be identified, leading to the rapid construction of
shared understanding, rapport and humour. When generous assumptions of common ground
fail to result in reciprocated turns, it may appear egocentric to the outside
observer, but when reciprocated, it can lead to increased affect, symmetry and
coherence, creating a rich intersubjective space for shared understanding.

The generous assumption of common ground and the low demand for coordination are more
than two isolated features; they potentially fit together into a functional system
that allows rich forms of social relating which can explain how rapid changes in
interaction dynamic are possible. It allows autistic participants to continually
experiment with ways of relating to their situation incurring minimal detrimental
impact to their social identity when references are not shared. It is the way that
these two features fit together to allow distinctive ways of building shared meaning
that we describe as a feature of neurodivergent intersubjectivity.

Our findings support previous research on the under-recognised ability of autistic
peers to be motivated and able to manage interactions with one another (Brownlow et al., 2015; Ryan and Räisänen, 2008)
and highlight the need to examine other contexts for autistic social interactions,
particularly given the potential for the activity of gaming to support the features
observed. For example, facing the screen and not each other circumvents the
challenges of face-to-face communication that many autistic people experience (Parsons and Cobb, 2011).
Affect scores may be improved through the motivating (Granic et al., 2014) and captivating (Ash, 2013) aspects of video
games, while repetitive gaming can enhance learning and establish context (Squire, 2006), making
assumptions of common ground easier to manage. Gaming also involved the integration
of first-person (direct experience), second-person (talking to each other) and
third-person (shared object of the screen) perspectives with frequent
position-exchange of social roles (i.e. helper-receiver, attacker-defender and
teacher-learner) allowing autistic participants to explore and play with
perspectives that they might not otherwise have exposure to in other domains of
social life (Wijnhoven et al.,
2015). This shared focus may account for some of the flexibility
participants demonstrated in changing topic and following implicit references, thus
studying other contexts without an object of shared focus will help to illuminate
more about the situational resources which support neurodivergent
intersubjectivity.

Further studies may also explore neurodivergent intersubjectivity in
cross-neurological contexts (e.g. job interviews) to understand the nature of the
‘double empathy problem’ (Heasman, 2017; Milton et al., 2018). Our findings reveal that neurodivergent
interactions provide opportunities for rich intersubjectivity even when faced with
severe fragmentation and raise questions as to whether neurotypical norms
potentially limit this possibility because they interpret such fragmentation as
failures needing to be addressed – thus limiting the potential of the conversation
to move on. For example, the difficulties autistic people experience in indexing
sociocultural meaning (Ochs and
Solomon, 2010) are not so problematic when sociocultural conventions are
relaxed because some autistic adults are able to delve into their own repositories
of symbolic resources to generate localised meanings and develop mutual
understanding. Likewise, fragmentation of the interaction coherence by attending to
different aspects of the interactional context (Bottema-Beutel, 2017) is less of a problem
when norms permit the spontaneous interchange of private and social speech. Thus our
findings highlight how neurodivergent intersubjectivity can potentially create rich
social interactions. Certainly, a first step to allowing neurodivergent
intersubjectivity to flourish (or at least not be undermined) is to recognise it as
having distinctive features that can be enabling.
