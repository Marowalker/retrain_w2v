Hemisphere-like
gold nanoparticles (NPs) were loaded on TiO2 (Au/TiO2) by the deposition–precipitation
method. Subsequent photodeposition of CdS on the Au surface of Au/TiO2 at 50 °C yields Au(core)–CdS(shell) hybrid quantum
dots with a heteroepitaxial (HEPI) junction on TiO2 (Au@#CdS/TiO2), whereas nonHEPI Au@CdS/TiO2 was formed by CdS
photodeposition at 25 °C. In the HEPI system, the shape of the
Au core changes to an angular shape, whereas it remains in a hemisphere-like
shape in the nonHEPI system. The hot photodeposition technique was
applied to the Au NP-loaded mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystalline
film (Au/mp-TiO2). Using Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 and
Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 as the photoanodes, two-electrode quantum
dot-sensitized photoelectrochemical cells were fabricated for hydrogen
(H2) generation from water, and the performances of the
cells were evaluated under illumination of simulated sunlight. In
the photocurrent and the rate of H2 evolution, the Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 photoanode cell surpasses the CdS/mp-TiO2 and
Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 ones. Three-dimensional finite-difference
time-domain calculations for the model systems indicated that the
angular shape Au core generates an intense electric field at the corners
and edges, extending the electric field distribution over the Au core–CdS
shell interface. The striking shape effect on the cell performances
can originate from the promotion of the CdS excitation and charge
separation due to the near-field enhancement by the deformed Au core.

1 Introduction
Plasmonic
photocatalysts consisting of metals and semiconductors
have recently attracted much interest as the key materials for solar-to-chemical
transformations.1−3 The optoelectric properties of the plasmonic metals
such as Au nanoparticles (NPs) strongly depend on the shape in addition
to the size and loading amount.4,5 Periodic arrays of Au
nanorods (NRs) were formed on a TiO2 single crystal electrode
(Au NR/TiO2) by electron beam lithography, and the plasmonic
activity for photoelectrochemical water splitting was studied under
external biased conditions.6 Also, TiO2-capped Au NR array with redox catalysts electrochemically
prepared using porous alumina templates shows photocatalytic activity
for water splitting without external wiring.7 In both the systems, two peaks corresponding to the transverse and
longitudinal modes of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
unique to the Au NRs were observed in the action spectrum of incident
photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE), and the hot-electron transfer
mechanism is proposed for the reaction.8 However, the study on the effect of the shape on the plasmonic photocatalytic
activity is limited because the synthesis of such catalysts usually
needs expensive experimental equipment and elaborated techniques.
On the other hand, a large contact area and a high-quality interface
between the metal and semiconductor are crucial for the efficient
interfacial electron transfer enhancing photocatalytic activity of
plasmonic photocatalysts.9,10 Colloidal solutions
of Au and CdS NRs were separately synthesized, and Au-NR/CdS-NR hybrids
were prepared by mixing them.11 The authors
showed that the Au-NR/CdS-NR exhibits high visible-light activities
for the oxidation of salicylic acid and reduction of p-nitrophenol due to the large contact area between Au- and CdS-NRs.
This colloid-based method is convenient and versatile for the preparation
of various metal–semiconductor nanohybrids; however, organic
modifiers are necessary as the shape-controlling agents contaminating
the interface between the components. Whereas postheating at high
temperatures improves the interface quality by removing the organic
modifiers, and may cause aggregation of metal NPs, and further, damage
of the components. Consequently, if a low temperature technique can
be developed for changing the shape of the components in metal–semiconductor
nanohybrids with a large contact area and high-quality interfaces,
it could provide basic and useful information about the shape effect
on the activity of the plasmonic photocatalysts. Here, we report in
situ shape change in the Au NP on TiO2 with the selective
photodeposition of the CdS shell on the Au NP at 50 °C, and the
mechanism on the low temperature formation of the heteroepitaxial
(HEPI) junction between the Au(core) and CdS(shell) (Au@CdS). Furthermore,
Au@CdS/TiO2 is applied as the photoanode of quantum dot-sensitized
photoelectrochemical cells (QD-SPECs) for H2 generation
from water, and the shape effect of the Au core on the cell performances
is discussed on the basis of the results of three-dimensional finite-difference
time-domain (3D-FDTD) calculations.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Hot Photodeposition of
CdS on Au/TiO2
The morphology of the samples was
checked by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The loading amount of Au on TiO2 was determined to be 0.0190 ± 0.002 g TiO2 g–1 by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICPS).
Au NPs with a hemisphere-like form and a mean diameter (dAu) of 8.0 nm (standard deviation = 1.8 nm) were deposited
on TiO2 by the deposition–precipitation method.12Figure 1A shows the TEM image for the sample with CdS photodeposited
on Au/TiO2 at 50 °C. A CdS shell is formed on the
surface of every Au NP to yield Au@CdS/TiO2. Similar TEM
images were observed for the samples prepared at 25 °C (Figure S1),13 where
the mean shell thickness of 7.7 nm (standard deviation = 2.3 nm) was
confirmed.12 The selective photodeposition
of CdS on Au was explainable in terms of the electron pool effect
of Au NP and the strong affinity of Au and sulfur.14 The amounts of CdS photodeposited on Au/TiO2 at 25 and 50 °C were comparable to 0.025 ± 0.003 g TiO2 g–1. Figure 1B shows X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the samples
prepared at 25 and 50 °C. The former has several diffraction
peaks of anatase TiO2 with a shoulder at 27 < 2θ
< 30°. In the pattern for the latter, two weak peaks are present
at 2θ = 26.62 and 28.42° assignable to the diffraction
from the (002) and (101) planes of hexagonal CdS. Figure 1C,D show Cd 3d- and Au 4f-X-ray
photoelectron (XP) spectra for Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, prepared
by varying photodeposition time (tPD),
respectively. In spectrum C, two signals are observed at binding energy
(EB) = 411.9 and 405.2 eV due to the emission
from the Cd 3d3/2 and Cd 3d5/2 orbitals, respectively,
intensifying with an increase in tPD.
In spectrum D, Au/TiO2 has emissions from the Au 4f5/2 orbital at EB = 86.4 eV and
the Au 4f7/2 orbital at EB =
82.8 eV, which disappear at tPD > 0.5
h. Evidently, the present photodeposition technique yields a hexagonal
CdS shell completely covering the Au core, and the rise in the deposition
temperature from 25 to 50 °C somewhat increases the CdS crystallinity.

To gain information about
the junction between the Au core and
the CdS shell, high-resolution (HR) TEM observation and analysis were
carried out. Figure 2A,B compare the typical HR-TEM images for Au@CdS/TiO2 prepared
at 25 and 50 °C. As shown in image A, the CdS photodeposition
at 25 °C yields nonHEPI Au@CdS hybrids on TiO2 (Au@CdS/TiO2) and the shape of the Au core remained to be in a hemisphere-like
shape. In image B, the CdS shell formation induces the Au(111) facets
with the d-spacing of 0.236 nm. The d-spacing of 0.335 nm for the CdS shell agrees with the value for
the hexagonal CdS(0002) plane. The CdS shell grows on the Au(111)
surface with a HEPI relation of CdS{0001}/Au{111} (Au@#CdS/TiO2): the symbol # denotes the HEPI junction between the Au core
and the CdS shell below. Figure 2C,D show the side view and top view of a model for
the CdS/Au NP interface, respectively. The interface consists of the
Au(111) plane and the S plane perpendicular to the c-axis of CdS. Importantly, the photodeposition of CdS on Au/TiO2 at 50 °C simultaneously changes the shape of the Au
core from a hemisphere-like shape to an angular shape with edges and
corners. A similar shape change in the Au core was also observed in
the CdS photodeposition on Au/ZnO.10

So far, several Au NP-metal chalcogenide
heteronanostructures with
the HEPI junction have been synthesized at temperatures in the range
from 170 to 300 °C.15−18 The basic mechanism on the low temperature formation
of Au@#CdS/TiO2 in the present system is discussed. The
general requirements to form the HEPI junction are small lattice mismatch
<15% for core–shell structures15 and slow crystal growth near the equilibrium conditions.19 Upon UV-light irradiation of Au/TiO2 in ethanol containing Cd2+ ions and S8, the
excited electrons in the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 are
transferred to the Au NPs. Simultaneous excitation of the Au NP-LSPR
can lead to the hot-electron transfer from the Au NPs to the CB of
TiO2,8 which is overwhelmed
by the electron transfer in the opposite direction under these conditions.20 The accumulation of the electrons in Au NPs
rises its Fermi energy (EF) to approach
the CB minimum of TiO2. S8 is selectively adsorbed
on Au NPs due to the strong S-Au bond (∼184 kJ mol–1),21 gradually reduced to S2– ions by the electrons accumulated in Au NPs with the concentration
being maintained low near the Au surface to react with Cd2+ ions. Consequently, the CdS shell slowly grows on the surface of
Au NP. The CdS deposition induces the Au(111) facet so as to generate
the maximum S-Au interfacial bonds stabilizing the interface between
the Au(111) with the largest surface Au-atom density and the S plane
of CdS(0001). Both the Au(111) and CdS(0001) planes have hexagonal
symmetry, and the three unit cells in the Au(111) plane (0.8651 nm)
fit with the two unit cells in the CdS(0001) plane (0.8274 nm) with
a lattice mismatch degree of −4.36%. The fact that the HEPI
junction between the Au core and the CdS shell can be induced by an
increase in the photodeposition temperature from 25 to 50 °C
indicates that the activation of the mobility of the Au surface atoms
is important for the formation of high-quality junction. The melting
point of transition metals is known to dramatically decrease with
increasing electron occupancy in the d-band above half filling or
increasing EF. Recent full-multiple scattering
calculations indicated that the bulk-state Au has 6.9% vacancy in
the d-band due to the hybridization of the 5d orbitals with 6s and
6p orbitals.22 The EF upward shift in Au NPs by the photoinduced electron transfer
from TiO2 may cause the surface phonon softening of Au
NPs. The enhancement of the vibrational amplitude on the surface atoms
can assist to reconstruct and relax the lattice mismatch at the interface.
Thus, the present photodeposition technique, satisfying the requirements
for the formation of HEPI, enables its low temperature formation.

2.2 Application to the QD-SPEC Cells
Au@#CdS/TiO2 is very promising as the photoanode for the
QD-SPEC cell for H2 generation from water,23−25 where the optical properties are fundamental to the application. Figure 3A compares UV–visible
absorption spectra for Au/mp-TiO2, CdS/mp-TiO2, Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2. The
absorption edge for the pristine mp-TiO2 composed of anatase
TiO2 nanocrystals is located at ∼390 nm. In the
spectrum for Au/mp-TiO2, the LSPR of Au NPs appears around
550 nm, and CdS/mp-TiO2 has absorption at λ <
510 nm due to the CdS interband transition. Although Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 possesses both the features of Au/mp-TiO2 and
CdS/mp-TiO2, the CdS shell formation induces significant
broadening and redshift in the LSPR peak from 550 to 640 nm. This
remarkable redshift and broadening in the LSPR peak would be due to
the large refractive index of the CdS shell (2.32)26 and the potent interaction between the Au core and the
CdS shell. The absorption spectrum for Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 is
similar to that for Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, but the former has
a significantly stronger LSPR than the latter at λ < 730
nm.

Figure 3 (A) UV–visible absorption spectra for Au/mp-TiO2 (green line), CdS/mp-TiO2 (black line), Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 (blue line), and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (red line), and
IPCE action spectra for the QD-SPEC cells using CdS/mp-TiO2 (black circle), Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 (blue circle), and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (red circle). (B) solar-to-current efficiency (STCE) as a
function of applied voltage (Eapp) for
the CdS/mp-TiO2 (black), Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 (blue),
and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (red) photoanode cells.

Two-electrode QD-SPEC cells were fabricated using
Au/mp-TiO2, CdS/mp-TiO2, Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 as the photoanode and Pt cathode,
and the photocurrents were
measured under illumination of simulated sunlight (λ > 430
nm,
AM 1.5, one sun). The STCE was calculated from the photocurrent (Jph) using 1 1  where Erev (V)
and I are the standard state reversible potential
for the overall cell reaction and the light intensity (100 mW cm–2), respectively. The Erev was calculated to be +0.23 V from the standard reaction Gibbs energy
of +44.3 kJ mol–1 for the present overall cell reaction.26Figure 3B shows STCEs for the QD-SPEC cells as a function of applied
bias (Eapp). The photocurrent for the
Au/mp-TiO2 photoanode cell was very small. This is probably
because of the poisoning of the Au NP surface by the oxidized S2– ions. The CdS/mp-TiO2 photoanode cell
shows a volcano-shaped one with a maximum of 0.0095% at Eapp = 0.125 V. The presence of the Au core greatly increases
the STCE, decreasing the Eapp, where the
STCE reaches maximum. Strikingly, the Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 photoanode
cell provides a maximum STCE of 0.037% at Eapp = 0.025 V, which is substantially larger than the value of 0.028%
at Eapp = 0 for Au@CdS/mp-TiO2.

To elucidate the origin for the Au core effect, three-electrode
PEC cells with the structure of a working electrode|0.25 M Na2S, 0.35 M Na2SO3|Ag/AgCl (reference
electrode)|counter electrode were constructed. A stable photocurrent
was observed for each cell (Figure S2).
Furthermore, the photocurrent was measured for the PEC cells with
CdS/mp-TiO2, Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 as the working electrodes under irradiation of monochromatic
light by varying its wavelength. In Figure 3A, the IPCE action spectra for the cells
are also shown. The onset wavelength for the photocurrent (λon) ranges from 560 to 600 nm, and the order of the IPCE value
at 430 < λ < 600 nm is CdS/mp-TiO2 < Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 < Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2. The discrepancy between
the λon and the CdS absorption edge (∼510
nm) indicates that the interfacial electron transfer from CdS to TiO2 occurs via the transition from the valence band (VB) of CdS
to the CB of TiO2 (path 2)27 besides the injection from the CB of CdS to the CB of TiO2 (path 1).14 In the Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 photoanodes, not the Au NP
core but the CdS shell acts as the photosensitizer, because the photocurrent
hardly flows around the LSPR peak of the Au core. Also, the Au core
and further, the high-quality junction between the Au core and the
CdS shell enhances the electron injection from CdS to TiO2.

Figure 4A
compares
the rate of H2 evolution under simulated sunlight illumination
(λ > 430 nm, AM 1.5, one sun) of the QD-SPEC cells with different
photoanodes. In the Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 photoanode cells, the amount of H2 increases proportionately
to irradiation time, while good linearity in the plot has also recently
been confirmed for the CdS/mp-TiO2 photoanode cell.28 These results indicate that every photoanode
stably works under these conditions. The rate of H2 evolution
is in the order of CdS/mp-TiO2 (0.03 mL h–1 cm–2) ≪ Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 (0.18
mL h–1 cm–2) < Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (0.20 mL h–1 cm–2). The
mean lifetime of the electrons injected into the CB of TiO2 (τn) can be estimated by analyzing
the potential decay curve in the three-electrode QD-SPEC cell by 2 2  where kB and q are the Boltzmann constant and the elementary
charge of
electron, respectively, and Voc is obtained
from the subtraction of the electrode potential in the dark (Edark) from the electrode potential under light
illumination (Eph).29Figure 4B shows plots of log(τn/s) vs Voc. Although the τn decreases with increasing Voc in every system, the value for the Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 cell is larger than that for CdS/mp-TiO2 at the
same Voc. The lifetime for the Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 cell is further longer than that for the Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 cell. Clearly, the Au core greatly enhances the charge separation
to induce the remarkable increase in the STCE. In Figure 3A, no photocurrent is observed
at λ > 600 nm, which excludes the hot-electron transfer mechanism
in this system.8 Thus, the superior performance
of Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 over Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 could
result from the shape change of the Au core rather than the high-quality
interface.10

H2 generation for the QD-SPEC cells.

and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (red), respectively.

2.3 FDTD Calculations
Three-dimensional
FDTD simulations were performed for a model of Au@CdS/TiO2 consisting of a CdS shell (thickness, lCdS = 7.7 nm)-coated Au hemisphere (dAu =
8 nm) placed on a TiO2 slab (Figure 5A). To clarify the shape effect of the Au
core, we also modeled Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 by a CdS shell-coated
Au nanocube placed on a TiO2 slab (Figure 5B), where the volumes of the cube and the
shell were set to be the same as those of Au@CdS/TiO2.
The models were illuminated with incident visible light parallel with
either the z-axis or x-axis toward
the hemisphere. The excited localized electromagnetic fields were
monitored at the cross-sectional planes of the models. To identify
the location of the excited fields, polarized light sources were used
in this simulation. Figure 5C shows wavelength dependence of maximum local electric field
enhancement factors monitored on the x–y plane (EFxy) and the x–z plane (EFxz) under x-polarized light incident from the z-axis direction (k//z, E//x). The enhancement factor
defined as the ratio of the local maximum electric field intensity
to the incident electric field intensity is highly dependent on the
excitation wavelength. The small EF in the off-resonant wavelength
region below 500 nm indicates that the interband transitions of Au
and CdS hardly contribute to the local electric field enhancement.
The peak value of EFxy for Au@#CdS/TiO2 (red dotted line) is 9.62 × 103 at an incident
light wavelength of 673 nm which is smaller than the value of 2.31
× 104 at 694 nm for Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 (black
dotted line). On the other hand, EFxz for
Au@#CdS/TiO2 (red solid line) surpasses EFxz for Au@CdS/TiO2 (black solid line) at
a wavelength of over 510 nm, where a significant difference in LSPR
absorption was observed (Figure 3A). The peak EFxz value
of 9.62 × 103 for the former is about 1 order of magnitude
larger than the value of 1.01 × 103 for the latter. Figure 5D shows the wavelength
dependence of EFs monitored on the x–y plane (EFxy) and the x–z plane (EFxz) under z-polarized light incident from the x-axis direction (k//x, E//z). EFxy and EFxz for Au@#CdS/TiO2 (red dotted and solid lines) far exceed those for Au@CdS/TiO2 (black dotted and solid lines) in a wavelength over ca. 530
nm, respectively. It is noteworthy that EFxy and EFxz for Au@#CdS/TiO2 are almost comparable with each other within the simulation wavelength
range both in Figure 5C,D, whereas EFs for Au@CdS/TiO2 are highly dependent
on the location of the monitor planes.

a nanocube. Wavelength dependence of a maximum local electric field

(D) z-polarized light incident from the x-axis direction (k//x, E//z) for Au@CdS/TiO2 (black)
and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (red). Values of the EF were monitored
on the x–y plane (EFxy, dotted line) and the x–z plane (EFxz solid line), respectively.

Figure 6A,C show
local electric field distribution in the x–y plane (upper row) and the x–z plane (lower row) for Au@CdS/TiO2 and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 excited by an x-polarized light incident
from the z-axis direction (k//z, E//x), respectively.
In all of these images, the LSPR is due to dipole resonance excitation
because the core size of the models is sufficiently smaller than the
incident light wavelength.30Figures 6Ai,ii and 6Ci,ii display an off-resonant electric field with the EFs
of approximately unity. As shown in Figure 6Aiii–viii, an intense local electric
field is formed on the equator of the Au hemisphere adjacent to the
CdS shell and the TiO2 slab irrespective of the incident
light wavelength. A similar local electric field distribution was
also confirmed for Au@SiO2/ZnO.31 The simulated field distribution can be explained by the lightning
rod effect (LRE), where the electric field at the curved surface is
highly intensified due to the condensation of electric field lines.32 As clearly seen in Figure 6Ciii–viii, the local electric field
for Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 is confined at the edge and the corner
of the Au nanocube due to LRE likewise. The dominant LSPR mode for
each incident light wavelength was assigned by using structural notation
of B, S, T, E, and C which represent bottom, side, top, edge, and
corner, respectively (Figure 5B inset). The dominant modes are the BE–BC–SE–TC
mode at 591 nm, the BE–BC mode at 673 nm, and the BC mode at
795 nm, respectively. Among these modes, the first and the second
modes are the coupled mode denoted by the hyphened notation of more
than two single modes. As for the first mode, SE–TC modes are
the modes formed in the direction perpendicular to the TiO2 slab (parallel with the z-axis), whereas the BE–BC
modes are the modes existing on the perimeter of the bottom square
of the Au nanocube. Also, the presence of the TE mode that is out
of the monitor planes was confirmed by using the polarized light inclined
45° from the x-axis. Thus, local field enhancement
occurs at the sharpened edges and corners even in the position away
from the TiO2 slab. In contrast, the field enhancement
for Au@CdS/TiO2 is limited in the x–y plane and the mode component distant from the TiO2 slab surface is of negligible magnitude. To inspect SE–TC
modes in more detail, we carried out the FDTD simulation under irradiation
of z-polarized light incident from the x-axis direction. EFxz for Au@#CdS/TiO2 far exceeds that for Au@CdS/TiO2 in a wavelength
over 535 nm (Figure 5D). Figure 6B exhibits
electric field distribution for Au@CdS/TiO2 where intense
local fields are formed on the periphery of the Au hemisphere similar
to the local field excited by x-polarized light incident
from the z-axis direction (Figure 6A). Electric fields are present at the zenith
of the Au hemisphere due to the hemispherical structure resonating
with the incident electric field parallel to the z-axis. Also, asymmetric electric field distribution on the periphery
(Figure 6Bv–viii)
is due to damping of electromagnetic energy toward the surrounding
environment during propagation of the electromagnetic wave from the
right side (+x) to the left side (−x) of the model. The periphery of the hemisphere plays an
exclusive role of propagation pathway of electromagnetic energy, whereas
the curved surface of the hemisphere hardly does. As for Au@#CdS/TiO2, intense electric fields excited due to resonance with z-polarized light are recognized at the top corner of the
Au nanocube (Figure 6D). Interestingly, propagating electric fields do not weaken the
strength even on the outgoing side. Similarly to LSPR excitation by z-incident light, LSPR excitation occurs at the corners
(BC, TC) and edges (BE, TE, SE). From the analysis of the field distribution
and the LSPR modes, we can attribute the enhancement of EFxz for Au@#CdS/TiO2 mainly to the excitation
of SE and TC modes. Symmetric electric field distribution in the cubic
model would result from the presence of complex propagation pathways
consisting of BC, BE, SE, TC, and TE. Complex propagation pathways
such as the one from the right-side SE to the left-side SE through
TC and TE enable efficient energy transfer over the cubic model even
if energy loss occurs during light propagation.

on the x–y and x–z planes, respectively. Inset arrows represent

TiO2 slab surface.

Field enhancement studies for hemispherical and cubic particles
have been reported so far, but are focused on the particles with a
geometrical length of over 10 nm.33−35 This is the first report
comparing the electric field enhancement between hemispherical and
cubic NPs with a size of sub-10 nm, i.e., 8.0 nm in equatorial diameter
for the former and 5.1 nm in edge length for the latter. The cubic
core structure is superior to the hemispherical structure with respect
to the ability to extend the local electric field away from the TiO2 slab surface even on the side opposite to incident light.
The results of FDTD simulation using polarized unidirectional light
illuminated to ideal model systems give an insight to interpret the
spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical data shown in Figure 3A,B which were obtained by
the omnidirectional illumination of unpolarized light on samples.
Thus, the presence of SE and TC modes in Au@#CdS/TiO2 suggests
that the electric interaction between the Au core and the CdS shell
is augmented by replacing the Au hemisphere with the Au nanocube.

2.4 Action Mechanism of Au@#CdS Hybrid QD-SPEC
Cell
The action mechanism of the Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 system can be basically explained by the near-field enhancement
mechanism (Scheme 1)36 in contrast to the hot-electron transfer
mechanism for water splitting by the half-cut Au@#CdS plasmonic photocatalyst.10 Visible-light irradiation (λ > 430
nm)
excites the electrons in the VB of the CdS shell to the CB. The CB
electrons with a potential of ECB = −1.12
V (vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE))37 are injected into the CB of TiO2 (ECB = −0.95 V at pH 14).38 Under irradiation conditions, the LSPR of the Au core is excited
simultaneously. The intense near-field generated at the Au/CdS and
Au/TiO2 interfaces can enhance the electron injection via
both path 1 and path 2 because the transition rates are proportional
to the square of the local electric field.39 For the effective operation of this enhancement mechanism, the spectral
overlap between the LSPR of the Au core and the interband transition
of the CdS shell or the electron transition from the VB of CdS to
the CB of TiO2 is necessary.40 First, the spectral overlap and the EFs in the energy region increase
with the deformation of the Au core from hemisphere to an angular
shape (Figures 3A and 5). Second, the angular shape Au core extends the
electric field distribution over the Au core–CdS shell (Figure 6C,D). The near field
of the Au core can also enhance the charge separation.41 Third, the assumption that the Au core-induced
local electric field in the direction normal to the TiO2 surface (z in Figure 5) mainly assists the electron injection from
CdS to the CB of TiO2 explains the longer lifetime of the
electrons or the more effective charge separation for Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 than Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 (Figure 4B). Fourth, the higher crystallinity of the
CdS shell in Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 would further contribute to
its excellent performance since the recombination through the defects
can be minimized. On the other hand, the holes in the VB of CdS (EVB = +1.30 V) easily oxidize S2– ions (E0(S2–/S) =
−0.45 V).42 These shape effects
of the Au core rationalize the excellent performances of the Au@#CdS
hybrid QD-SPEC cell for H2 generation from water.

3 Conclusions
This study has shown that the CdS photodeposition
on Au/TiO2 at as low as 50 °C leads to shape change
in the Au NP
from hemisphere-like shape to an angular shape with the formation
of a HEPI junction between Au and CdS (Au@#CdS/TiO2). Striking
shape effects are presented in the performance of the QD-SPEC cell
using Au@#CdS/TiO2 as the photoanode for H2 generation
from water under simulated sunlight. We anticipate that the versatility
of the present hot photodeposition technique40 widely contributes to the improvement in the solar-to-chemical conversion
efficiency of not only the QD-SPEC cells but also for heteronanostructured
photocatalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
Mesoporous TiO2 thin
films (mp-TiO2) were prepared using a previously
reported procedure.27 An anatase TiO2 paste (20 nm in a mean particle size,
PST-18NR, Nikki Syokubai Kasei) was coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide
film-coated glass substrates (<10 Ω/square) by a squeegee
method, and air calcination at 773 K was conducted for the as-coated
samples to form a mesoporous structure in the film. The mp-TiO2 films thus prepared and anatase TiO2 particles
(A-100, specific surface area = 8.1 m2 g–1, Ishihara Sangyo) were used as supports of Au NPs. Au NP-loaded
TiO2 (Au/TiO2) was prepared by the deposition–precipitation
method. An aqueous solution of HAuCl4 (0.243 mM, 100 mL)
was neutralized by 1 M aq NaOH to be pH 6. To this solution, mp-TiO2 or TiO2 particles were added and stirred at 70
°C for 1 h. The resulting film or precipitate was harvested from
the solution and rinsed with distilled water. The sample was dried
in vacuo at room temperature and heated at 500 °C for 1 h to
obtain Au/mp-TiO2 and Au/TiO2. Au@CdS/(mp-)TiO2 and Au@#CdS/(mp-)TiO2 were prepared by photodeposition
of the CdS shell layer on the Au-loaded TiO2 film or particles.
The Au-loaded sample was immersed in a solution of S8 (1.36
mM) and Cd(ClO4)2 (13.6 mM) in EtOH (200 mL),
and deaerated by Ar bubbling for 0.5 h in the dark. UV irradiation
(λ > 320 nm, I310–400 =
3.6
mW cm–2) was carried out with a high-pressure mercury
lamp (H-400P, Toshiba) at 298 K for the preparation of Au@CdS/(mp-)TiO2 and at 323 K for the preparation of Au@#CdS/(mp-)TiO2 by varying the photodeposition time (tPD), respectively. After irradiation, the films were taken
out from the solution and the particles were harvested by centrifugal
separation from the solution. The obtained films and particles were
rinsed with ethanol repeatedly to be stored at ambient temperature
after vacuum drying. CdS-deposited mp-TiO2 (CdS/mp-TiO2) was prepared by the photodeposition method for the pristine
mp-TiO2 film.

4.2 Characterization
The loading amounts
of Au and CdS were quantified by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy
(ICPS-7500, Shimadzu). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried
out with a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer. Diffuse reflectance
UV–vis spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV-2600 spectrometer
(Shimadzu) with an integrating sphere unit (Shimadzu, ISR-2600Plus)
at room temperature. BaSO4 was used as a reference material
to evaluate the reflectance (R∞) of the samples. The reflectance was transformed to the Kubelka–Munk
function [F(R∞)] presenting the relative absorption coefficient by the equation F(R∞) = (1 – R∞)2/2R∞.43 Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F
at an applied voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy
measurements were performed using a Kratos Axis Nova X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) operated at 15 kV and 10 mA. The takeoff
angle was 90°, and multiplex spectra were obtained for Cd 3d
and Au 4f photopeaks.

4.3 Photoelectrochemical Measurements
The solar-to-current efficiency (STCE) was measured for a two-electrode
QD-SPEC cell consisting of CdS/mp-TiO2, Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (photoanode)|0.25 M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3 (aqueous electrolyte
solution)|Pt (cathode). Photocurrents (Jph) of the cell were evaluated under illumination by a solar simulator
(PEC-L10, Peccell technologies, Inc.) at one sun (λ > 430
nm,
AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2). Upon photoelectrochemical
measurement, a bias voltage (Eapp) in
the range between 0 and 0.23 V was applied to the cell. Also, argon
bubbling was carried out to remove the oxygen in the solution. A three-electrode
PEC cells consisting of CdS/mp-TiO2, Au@CdS/mp-TiO2, and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 (working electrode)|0.25
M Na2S + 0.35 M Na2SO3 (aqueous electrolyte
solution)|Ag/AgCl (reference electrode)|Pt (counter electrode) were
constructed to record the action spectra of IPCE. A 500 W-Xe short
arc lamp (UXL-500D-O, Ushio Inc.) was used as a light source to illuminate
one sun (λ > 430 nm, AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2)
onto the cell. J–E curves
for the PEC cells under light illumination or in the dark were measured
with a potentiostat/galvanostat (HZ-5000, Hokuto Denko). The action
spectra of IPCE were recorded under illumination of monochromatic
light from a xenon lamp through a monochromator (full width at half-maximum
= 10 nm, HM-5, JASCO). The short-circuit current at the rest potential
was measured as a function of excitation wavelength (λ/nm).
Calculation formula for the incident photon-to-current efficiency
(IPCE) is shown below (3) 3  where Jph(E), NA, I (W
cm–2), F, h, and c are the photocurrent at an electrode potential of E, Avogadro constant, light intensity, Faraday constant,
Planck constant, and speed of light, respectively.

4.4 Three-Dimensional FDTD Simulations
Local electric field
distribution and wavelength dependence of the
enhancement factor (EF) for Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 and Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 were simulated by the 3D FDTD-method Maxwell solver using
FDTD Solutions (Lumerical Solutions, Inc.). Au@CdS/mp-TiO2 was modeled by a CdS hemispherical shell-covered Au hemispherical
particle placed on a TiO2 slab (500 × 500 × 50
nm3). The diameter of the Au core particle and the thickness
of the CdS shell were set to be the experimental values (8 and 7.7
nm), respectively. For Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2, the Au core particle
was modeled by a nanocube incorporated into the CdS hemispherical
shell. The volumes of the Au nanocube (5.1 × 5.1 × 5.1 nm3) and the surrounding CdS shell for Au@#CdS/mp-TiO2 were kept the same as the corresponding volumes for Au@CdS/mp-TiO2. The origin of the Cartesian coordinate (x = y = z = 0) was located at the
midpoint of the cross-sectional plane of the Au hemisphere and the
center of the bottom rectangle of the Au nanocube. The position of
the top surface of the TiO2 slab was fixed at z = 0. The near-field enhancement for the models was simulated using
the total-field scattered-field source. In the simulation, a polarized
light source with the wavelength from 300 to 900 nm (f = 200–353 THz) was irradiated to the core–shell hemisphere
from the normal direction (wave vector k//z) or the parallel direction (k//x) to the TiO2 slab. The light incidence of k//z and k//x was performed with polarization along the x-axis
(E//x) and z-axis
(E//z), respectively. For the purpose
of improving the accuracy of simulation, the mesh override region
with a finer mesh size than that in the previous study41 was set to the core–shell hemispheres.
The simulation region was surrounded by a perfectly matched layer
absorbing boundary to remove unwanted light reflection at the simulation
boundary. To minimize the computational time, antisymmetric and symmetric
boundary conditions were used in the x-axis and y-axis directions, respectively. The enhancement factor
is defined by the following equation: EF = |E|2/|E0|2, where |E| and |E0| are the amplitude
of the local maximum electric field and the amplitude of incident
electric field, respectively. Optical constants for Au, CdS, and TiO2 used in the simulation were taken from refs (44−46). The refractive index of surrounding medium was set
to be a value of air (n = 1.0).
