Meldrum’s
acid (MA) is utilized as a monomer to polymerize
with diisocyanates to result in polyamides, containing MA moieties
at polymer chains. This reaction is also employed to prepare isocyanate-terminated
polyamide segments which are utilized as a precursor for preparation
of MA-containing polyurethanes. Based on the thermolysis reaction
of MA groups, followed by ketene dimerization reaction, the reactive
polyamides and polyurethanes show self-cross-linkable features. The
cross-linked polyurethanes exhibit good film formability, thermal
stability, and mechanical properties. A new MA-based polymerization
method and a novel synthesis route for preparation of reactive polyamides
and polyurethanes are demonstrated.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Reactive polymers are
attractive in both polymer chemistry and
materials as they possess functional groups being capable of performing
further chemical reactions at polymer chains for polymer modification,
functionalization, and cross-linking.1,2 Preparation
routes of reactive polymers could be divided into two categories.
One is performing reactions on polymer chains to introduce reactive
groups to the polymer chains. For example, incorporation of halomethyl
groups to polyethersulfone has been carried out for further reactions
and applications.3−7 The other approach is employing a monomer which contains a reactive
group in polymerization.8,9 The resulting polymer
chains consequently possess this reactive group. One example could
be used as a dianhydride containing a hydroxyl group in polymerization
with a diamine compound. The resulting polyimide possesses hydroxyl
groups for further chemical reactions.10−14 Although polymer reactions exhibit some convenience
for commercial polymer products, the later approach has much flexibility
on molecular designs and chemical diversity.

The chemically
reactive groups play a key role in the chemical
reactivity and diversity of reactive polymers. One of attractive groups
to be incorporated to reactive polymer chains is Meldrum’s
acid (MA) group. Under heating, MA could undergo thermolysis reaction
to generate a ketene with evolving CO2 and acetone molecules.
Hence, the MA group is an effective precursor of the ketene group.15 Ketene has a high chemical reactivity toward
nucleophiles16 such as hydroxyl, amine,
and isocyanate groups to result in ester, amide, and azitidine-2,4-dione
groups, respectively.15,17,18 Dimerization reaction of ketene could also take place at high temperatures
to generate the corresponding 1,3-butandione group.15 Based on the ketene chemistry, reactive polymers possessing
MA groups were first reported with Hawker et al.15 and then have received other researchers’ attention.19−29 Reactive polymers possessing pendent MA groups have been prepared
through radical polymerization,15 ring-opening
metathesis polymerization,19 and step polymerization25−29 with associated MA-containing monomers. Postfunctionalization and
cross-linking reaction have been carried out on the polymers based
on MA thermolysis reaction and ketene chemistry.

The MA derivatives
used as the monomers in the abovementioned polymerization
systems are synthesized through chemical reactions taking advantage
of the reactivity of the acidic C–H bonds of MA,30 including Mitsunobu condensation,31 dehydrohalide reaction,15,23 and Knoevenagel condensation.32−34 For example, the MA derivative
possessing two styrenic moieties could be obtained from the reaction
of one MA and two chloromethylstyrene molecules.23 This concept inspires our interests in directly using MA
as a difunctional monomer in polymerization systems and preparation
of the corresponding MA-containing polymer chains. The first example
is Michael-addition reaction-based MA polymerization, in which MA
has been polymerized with a bismaleimide to result in poly(succinimide),
possessing MA reactive groups at the main chains.29 In this work, we report a continuous effort on this topic—direct
utilization of MA as a monomer in polymerization systems. As an isocyanate
group is reactive toward chemical groups possessing active hydrogens,
such as hydroxyl, amine, and carboxylic acid groups, the reactivity
between isocyanate and the acidic C–H bonds of MA is reasonable.
A polymerization system employing MA and a diisocyanate compound as
the monomers has been established. The resulting polymers are reactive
polyamides possessing MA reactive groups. Consequently, in addition
to preparation of MA-containing reactive polymers, this polymerization
system itself is a new synthetic route for polyamides.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Polymerization of MA and
Difunctional Isocyanate
Compounds
The reaction between the acidic C–H bonds
of MA and isocyanate groups is first examined with a monofunctional
isocyanate compound (IPTES) and MA. The reaction is traced with 1H NMR. As the spectra shown in Figure 1, after a reaction at 25 °C for 24 h,
the decreases in the peak intensities of the acidic C–H of MA (peak a) and −CH2–NCO of IPTES support the reaction
taking place between these two groups. The occurrence of the reaction
also transforms the isocyanate group to amide linkage so as to result
in chemical shifts of the isopropyl groups toward lower frequency
(peaks b′ and c′). Based on the reaction, two diisocyanate
compounds of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and methylene diphenyl
diisocyanate (MDI) were employed in this study to polymerize with
MA. The polymerization reaction was carried out in dried dimethylformamide
(DMF) at about 30 °C for 24 h (Scheme 1). A certain amount of lithium chloride was
added to enhance the solubility of the formed polyamide in the solvent.
The obtained polyamides were subjected to solubility tests (3 mg mL–1) in various solvents.35 Poly(MA-HDI) could only be dissolved in hexafluoroisopropanol (6F-IPA)
and formic acid, and shows poor solubility in common polar solvents
such as acetone, tetrahydrofuran (THF), DMF, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Poly(MA-MDI) shows a relatively
good organosolubility as it could be readily soluble in DMF, DMSO,
NMP, 6F-IPA, and formic acid. The poor solubility of the polymers
could be attributed to the interchain hydrogen bonding between the
amide groups. With employing NMP as the solvent, poly(MA-MDI) shows
an inherent viscosity of about 0.074 dL g–1. Based
on the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada (MHS) equation reported
to polyamide in dimethylacetamide ([η] (mL g–1) = 0.06 × Mw0.60),36 the estimated molecular weight of poly(MA-MDI)
is about 3020 g mol–1. The relatively small value
of inherent viscosity and low-molecular weight of poly(MA-MDI) indicate
the reaction rate between MA and isocyanate is not high.

Figure 1 1H NMR spectra of the mixture of MA and IPTES (in deuterated
DMF) recorded on (a) the sample as prepared and (b) sample after being
reacted at 25 °C for 24 h.

Scheme 1 Polymerization of MA and Diisocyanate Compounds for Preparation
of
Reactive Polyamides Possessing MA Moieties
Spectral characterization of poly(MA-MDI) has been carried
out
with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) (Figure 2). The absorption peaks of the C–H
bonds of MA at 2930 and 3004 cm–1 and −N=C=O
groups of MDI at 2275 cm–1 were not observed in
the spectrum of poly(MA-MDI), indicating the polymerization reaction
taking place between these two groups. The reaction between C–H
and −N=C=O results in amide linkages showing
absorption peaks at 1650 cm–1 (amide I) and 1548
cm–1 (amide II) in the spectrum of poly(MA-MDI).
These two peaks did not appear in the spectra of MA and MDI. Poly(MA-MDI)
still exhibits characteristic absorption peaks of the MA ring (ester
group, 1740, 1710, and 1308 cm–1) and of MDI (phenyl
group, 1508 cm–1), supporting to its expected chemical
structure. Further characterization on poly(MA-MDI) has been carried
out with 1H NMR. As the spectra shown in Figure 1, poly(MA-MDI) exhibits resonance
peaks at δ = 1.65 ppm and δ = 7.05–7.45 ppm associating
to the −CH3 group of MA and phenyl group of MDI,
respectively. The amide linkages are characterized with the resonance
peak at δ = 8.52 ppm. Meanwhile, the resonance peak of acidic
C–H at δ = 4.08 ppm was not observed with poly(MA-MDI),
supporting that there are no MA monomers remained in the product.
The result is also supported with the 13C NMR analysis.
The formed amide linkages show resonance peaks at δ = 164–170
ppm. It is worth noting that the resonance peak at δ = 123 ppm
indicates the presence of some isocyanate groups, which should be
at the chain ends as the chain lengths are not high (low inherent
viscosity).

Figure 2 Spectral characterization of poly(MA-MDI) with (a) FTIR, (b) 1H NMR, and (c) 13C NMR.

Poly(MA-MDI) shows an endothermic peak at about 235 °C
followed
with an exothermic peak at about 240 °C (Figure 3), associated with the MA thermolysis reaction
and ketene dimerization reaction, respectively.15 The MA thermolysis reaction accompanies CO2 evolution
and acetone as byproducts,15 so as to exhibit
a weight loss at around 200 °C in thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) measurement. The theoretical weight loss fraction calculated
from the repeating unit of MA–MDI is about 25.9 wt %, which
is much higher than the measured value of about 12 wt %. The result
might suggest that poly(MA-MDI) chains do not contain equal molar
MA and MDI units. The polymer chain ends could be MDI-capped. The
result is coincident to what was observed with the NMR analysis, as
poly(MA-MDI) does not show resonance peaks of the acidic C–H
of the MA unit in the 1H NMR spectrum, and demonstrates
the isocyanate signal in 13C NMR measurement.

Figure 3 Thermal analysis
of poly(MA-MDI) with (a) DSC and (b) TGA instruments.
The thermograms of MA are also included for comparison.

Poly(MA-MDI) has been subjected to a thermally
cross-linking process.
The corresponding cross-linked sample [CR-poly(MA-MDI)] loses its
organosolubility supporting to the formation of the cross-linked structure.
Nevertheless, thermal mechanical analysis on CR-poly(MA-MDI) is a
failure due to its high brittleness. Although polymerization of MA
and diisocyanate has demonstrated a new approach for preparation of
reactive polyamides containing MA moieties, the low-molecular weight
of the obtained poly(MA-MDI) limits needs further studies on optimizing
the reaction conditions.

2.2 Reactive Poly(amide-urethane)
Containing MA
Moieties
With the purpose of extending the molecular weight
of the MA-containing reactive polymer, the chemistry for polyurethane
preparation has been utilized (Scheme 2). A mixture of MA and MDI in a molar ratio of 1:2
was charged to the polymerization system to result in a diisocyanate-terminated
MA–MDI precursor. Then, equipment of a diol compound, ethylene
glycol (EG), poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, number-averaged molecular
weight: 200 Da), and 1,6-hexanediol (HD), was added as a chain extender.
The obtained products could be reactive poly(amide-urethane)s containing
reactive MA moieties and are coded as poly(MA-MDI/EG), poly(MA-MDI/PEG),
and poly(MA-MDI/HD). Spectral characterization of the poly(amide-urethane)s
has been carried out with FTIR and NMR. The recorded spectra of poly(MA-MDI/EG)
are shown in Figure 4 as examples. The EG segments in poly(MA-MDI/EG) are characterized
with the absorption peaks at 2900–3000 cm–1 (−CH2−) and 1050 cm–1 (C–O) in the FTIR spectrum. The EG segments also exhibit
the resonance peak at δ = 4.15 ppm in 1H NMR and
δ = 63 ppm in 13C NMR. Moreover, poly(MA-MDI/HD)
also exhibits a resonance peak of methylene groups at δ = 1.35
ppm in 1H NMR and δ = 25 and 28 ppm in 13C NMR analysis (figure not shown). The MA molar content in the feeding
monomer compositions (1:2:1 for MA, MDI, and diol) is 25%. The exact
content of MA in the polymer chains could be calculated from the characteristic
peak area in 1H NMR spectra. The value found with poly(MA-MDI/EG),
poly(MA-MDI/PEG), and poly(MA-MDI/HD) is about 24, 21, and 23%, respectively.
All three samples are readily soluble in the solvents which poly(MA-MDI)
is soluble in. Moreover, poly(MA-MDI/HD) is also soluble in acetone.
The inherent viscosity of poly(MA-MDI/EG), poly(MA-MDI/HD), and poly(MA-MDI/PEG)
is 0.10, 0.16, and 0.19 dL g–1, respectively. The
molecular weight of poly(MA-MDI/EG), poly(MA-MDI/HD), and poly(MA-MDI/PEG),
which has been estimated with a MHS equation reported to polyurethane
([η] (mL g–1) = 0.101 × Mw0.59)37 is about
2400, 5400, and 7200 g mol–1, respectively. The
longer molecular length of the diol compound utilized in the polymerization
system is the corresponding polymer has a higher molecular weight.

Scheme 2 Synthesis Route for Preparation of Reactive Poly(amide-urethane)s
Containing nMA Moieties
All three MA-containing poly(amide-urethane)s have been
applied
to thermal analysis to trace the MA thermolysis/ketene dimerization
reaction, as what discussed on poly(MA-MDI). Not like poly(MA-MDI),
the three samples did not exhibit obvious endothermic/exothermic behaviors
in heating scans up to about 300 °C. This result could be attributed
to their relatively low contents of MA moieties. In TGA measurements,
poly(MA-MDI/EG) shows a weight loss of about 17 wt % at about 260
°C (Figure 5),
which might be associated with the MA thermolysis reaction. Nevertheless,
some chain-scissoring reaction might occur at this high temperature
as the weight loss fraction is higher than the theoretical value of
about 14 wt %, and the weight loss behavior overlaps with the major
degradation region. Moreover, this stage of weight loss is not observed
with poly(MA-MDI/PEG) and poly(MA-MDI/HD), as these two samples possess
relatively low fractions of MA groups. To further trace the MA thermolysis/ketene
dimerization reaction, FTIR spectra of poly(MA-MDI/EG) before and
after thermal treatment (200 °C for 1 h and 240 °C for 1
h) are collected in Figure 6. Performance of the MA thermolysis/ketene dimerization reaction
could be characterized with the absorption peak of the 1,3-butandione
group at about 1900 cm–1.15 The result supports to both poly(MA-MDI/EG)-possessing reactive
MA moieties and poly(MA-MDI/EG) could undergo cross-linking reaction
through MA thermolysis/ketene dimerization reaction.

3 poly(amide-urethane)s prepared in this
work.

the cross-linking reaction based on MA thermolysis and ketene dimerization
reactions.

2.3 Cross-linked
Poly(amide-urethane) Films
Based on the preliminary test
on cross-linking reaction of poly(MA-MDI/EG),
poly(MA-MDI/EG) was fabricated into films through a solution-casting
method. The sample was then thermally cross-linked with a step-heating
process mentioned in the Materials and Methods section to result in
the corresponding samples of CR-poly(MA-MDI/EG). The other two samples
of CR-poly(MA-MDI/PEG) and CR-poly(MA-MDI/HD) were also obtained with
the same manner. As the three uncross-linked samples are readily soluble
in NMP, the cross-linked films loses their solubility in NMP to show
a gel fraction (the insoluble fraction of the sample in NMP after
a test of 24 h) of 76, 86, and 82 wt % for CR-poly(MA-MDI/EG), CR-poly(MA-MDI/PEG),
and CR-poly(MA-MDI/HD), respectively. The gel fractions are high enough
to support the formation of cross-linked structures in the films.
Nevertheless, the cross-linking might not be as high as other thermosetting
resins prepared with small molecular monomers.

The three cross-linked
polymers films have been applied to dynamic thermal analysis (DMA)
(Figure 7). The glass
transition temperature (Tg) of the samples
taking at the tan δ peak is 141, 87, and 128 °C for CR-poly(MA-MDI/EG),
CR-poly(MA-MDI/PEG), and CR-poly(MA-MDI/HD), respectively. The values
of Tg’s could be correlated to
the cross-linked densities of the films as well as to the MA contents
of the corresponding precursors. It is noteworthy that CR-poly(MA-MDI/EG)
and CR-poly(MA-MDI/HD) show a storage modulus of about 800 MPa at
glassy states (50 °C), supporting to their high mechanical strengths.
The relatively long and flexible PEG segments result in a decrease
in the storage modulus of CR-poly(MA-MDI/PEG) to about 400 MPa at
20 °C.

Figure 7 DMA thermograms of the cross-linked poly(amide-urethane): (a) CR-poly(MA-MDI/EG),
(b) CR-poly(MA-MDI/PEG), and (c) CR-poly(MA-MDI/HD).

The results demonstrate that MA could be an effective
precursor
for preparation of cross-linkable poly(amide-urethane)s and the corresponding
cross-linked poly(amide-urethane)s with good film formability, thermal
stability, and mechanical properties.

3 Conclusions
Based on the acidic C–H bonds, MA is reactive toward isocyanate
compounds. This reaction is further extended to a new polymerization
method directly employing MA as a monomer. This polymerization also
provides an effective route for preparation of reactive polyamides
and polyurethanes containing MA moieties as the reactive groups for
further modification and cross-linking reactions. Based on the polymerization
chemistry of the MA compound and the reactivity of MA rings, this
work has demonstrated an effective synthesis route for reactive polyamides
and polyurethanes.

min–1, 0.1 N, 1 Hz, and 10 μm, respectively.

4.3 Preparation of Polyamides
Poly(MA-MDI)
was prepared with the polymerization between MA and MDI. The monomers
of MA (1.0 g, 6.94 mmol) and MDI (1.76 g, 6.94 mmol) were dissolved
in dried DMF (20 mL). After addition of 0.4 g of lithium chloride,
the solution was charged into a 50 mL round bottom flask. After being
reacted at room temperature for 24 h, the product was precipitated
from excess methanol, collected with filtration, and dried under vacuum
at room temperature. Purification of the product was performed with
the dissolution–precipitation process twice. Poly(MA-MDI) was
obtained as light yellow powder (2.57 g, yield: 94%). Poly(MA-HDI)
was prepared in the same manner employing MA and HDI as the monomers.

4.4 Preparation of Poly(amide-urethane)s
Poly(MA-MDI/EG)
was prepared with two-step polymerization in an one-pot
reaction. MA (0.5 g, 3.47 mmol) and MDI (7.736 g, 6.94 mmol) were
dissolved in dried DMF (20 mL). The solution was reacted at room temperature
for 24 h. After addition of EG (0.215 g, 3.47 mmol), the solution
was then reacted at 70 °C for another 2 h. The solution was added
to excess methanol dropwise. The precipitant was collected with filtration
and dried under vacuum at room temperature. After being purified with
the dissolution–precipitation process twice, a product in yellow
was obtained (2.24 g, yield: 91 wt %). Poly(MA-MDI/PEG) and poly(MA-MDI/HD)
were obtained in the same manner.

4.5 Preparation
of Cross-linked Poly(amide-urethane)

with standing for 48 h. The solution was casted on a glass plate with
a blade knife with a gap of 300 μm. The sample was put in an
oven at 80 °C for 24 h for removal of solvent and then thermally
cross-linked at 120, 160, 200, and 240 °C. The reaction time
for each temperature is 1 h. After being cooled, the sample was immersed
into a water/ethanol bath (v/v: 1/1) for being detached from the glass
substrate. The film was then dried at 60 °C under vacuum for
3 h.
