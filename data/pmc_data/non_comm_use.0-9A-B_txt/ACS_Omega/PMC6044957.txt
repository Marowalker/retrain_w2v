Two sol–gel synthetic routes
for the preparation of CaTiO3:Pr3+ red emitting
phosphors were compared, with
the aim of producing nanostructured materials with tailored luminescence/afterglow
properties. The effect of the synthetic parameters, such as the addition
of a stabilizer and calcination temperature, on the structural, morphological,
and optical properties was investigated. The desired perovskite phase
was obtained at a calcination temperature of 800 °C or higher.
Although the use of acetic acid as the chelating agent leads to micrometric
particles with heterogeneous composition, the presence of hydroxypropylcellulose
(HPC) results in smaller, less aggregated particles as well as in
a high phase purity. At the highest HPC content, surface Ca-rich impurities
were detected, although no segregated Ca-rich phases were detectable
by X-ray powder diffraction analyses. Luminescence properties were
found to be positively related to the phase purity of the oxide, with
the highest quantum yields at temperatures equal to or higher than
1000 °C. On the contrary, persistent luminescence properties
were highest at intermediate calcination temperatures and for samples
synthesized with acetic acid. Overall, a notable role of oxygen vacancies
resulting from local Ca excess was observed, acting as trap levels
promoting longer relaxation pathways. Thanks to the small-sized particles
and best steady-state luminescent properties due to a substantial
decrease of lattice defects, the HPC synthesis is a promising strategy
for light-emitting diode applications. On the other hand, the acetic
acid synthesis promoted a higher defect density, which is required
for an efficient yield of light emission in the long time range and
is thus more suitable for afterglow applications.

1 Introduction
Praseodymium-doped
calcium titanate (CaTiO3:Pr3+) is a phosphor
showing a red emission very close to the International
Commission on Illumination coordinates of ideal red.1 Furthermore, this compound has a high chemical and thermal
stability, a good resistance to high-density electron irradiation,
and its luminescence efficiency can be maintained under a prolonged
flow of electric charge.2,3 These properties make
CaTiO3:Pr3+ a promising candidate to substitute
currently available red luminescent materials in applications such
as light-emitting diode (LED) displays, low-voltage field emission
displays (FEDs), and plasma display panels.4

Furthermore, CaTiO3:Pr3+ belongs to
the class
of persistent phosphors, that is, materials exhibiting sustained light
emission for an extended duration after removal of the light source.
While materials with blue or green afterglow emission are relatively
common, red persistent phosphors are quite rare. As a result, CaTiO3:Pr3+ represents a promising material for a broad
range of applications, such as safety signage, sunlight storage, and
bioimaging.5

Owing to the luminescence
and afterglow properties of CaTiO3:Pr3+, a great
deal of effort has been devoted
to developing tailored synthetic routes of this material. A careful
design of the synthetic procedure is crucial to either reduce the
afterglow for display applications or, oppositely, to enhance the
afterglow for application as persistent phosphors.3,6 The
most commonly reported synthetic procedures are based on solid-state
reactions, especially for applications as luminescent materials.7,8 Several other synthetic approaches for the synthesis of pure and
doped CaTiO3 have been reported, such as solvothermal,9 hydrothermal,10,11 electrospinning,1 sputtering,12 sonochemical,2 and template synthesis.13,14 However, not all of the reported procedures are able to provide
at the same time a good degree of crystallinity and nanometric morphologies.
In this respect, sol–gel syntheses present several advantages
with respect to the more commonly employed solid-state reactions,
for example, lower reaction temperatures, higher homogeneity of the
final product, and smaller particles.15 This latter aspect is favorable to applications in bioimaging as
well as in displays like LED and FED, where smaller grain sizes may
reduce charge accumulation.16

In
this work, different sol–gel synthetic approaches for
the synthesis of CaTiO3:Pr3+ phosphors are compared
with the aim of controlling the particle morphology and tailoring
the luminescence/afterglow properties for different applications.
The two investigated approaches differ only for the type of species
added to modulate crystal growth and agglomeration phenomena: a method
in the presence of a chelating acid (acetic acid) as hydrolysis inhibitor
and another method based on the addition of a polymer (hydroxypropylcellulose,
HPC) as steric stabilizer. To the authors’ best knowledge,
these synthetic approaches have never been previously adopted for
the preparation of phosphors based on CaTiO3. The effect
of the ensuing calcination step (in the range 600–1200 °C)
is discussed in detail. The prepared samples were thoroughly characterized
for their structural, morphological, optical, and luminescence properties.
The duration of the luminescence after the removal of the light source
was investigated by both luminescence decay measurements (studying
short emission, in the microseconds range) and persistent luminescence
measurements (long emission, in the order of minutes).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural Features
X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) measurements
were carried out to identify the crystalline structure of each sample. Figures 1 and S1 present the XRPD patterns of Pr-doped and
undoped samples, respectively. The standard pattern of orthorhombic
perovskite CaTiO3 is reported as a reference.

Figure 1 XRPD patterns
of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples calcined
at different temperatures: (a) AA; (b) HPC 0.5 g; (c) HPC 1 g. The
standard pattern of orthorhombic CaTiO3 perovskite is reported
as a reference, highlighting the most intense peak, (112). The main
impurity peaks are also highlighted: CaCO3 (star), Ca(OH)2 (full square), CaO (full circle), anatase TiO2 (empty circle), and rutile TiO2 (diamond).

The CaTiO3:Pr3+ AA sample
calcined at 600
°C (Figure 1a)
shows an XRPD pattern characteristic of a crystalline sample, with
calcite CaCO3 as the main component and smaller amounts
of other phases (anatase TiO2, orthorhombic CaTiO3, and CaO). On the contrary, the two samples synthesized with HPC
and annealed at 600 °C (Figure 1b,c) show XRPD patterns characteristic of an essentially
amorphous phase, as evidenced from the absence of well defined and
intense peaks. This observation is supported also by photoluminescence
measurements (vide infra). Similar to the doped sample, the undoped
CaTiO3 AA sample calcined at 600 °C is crystalline
(Figure S1) and presents calcite CaCO3 as main phase, with CaO and CaTiO3 as minor components.
Undoped samples from HPC synthesis are much less crystalline (Figure S1). This difference can be related to
the presence of HPC, which has been reported to affect the phase composition
of oxides synthesized via sol–gel reactions.17

Although all samples calcined at 800 °C present
orthorhombic
perovskite CaTiO3 (ICDS 16688) as the main component, the
two sets of syntheses are rather different. The AA_800 samples show
orthorhombic CaTiO3 as the main component and significant
amounts of impurities, mainly Ca(OH)2, rutile TiO2, and CaCO3, as clearly appreciable from Figure 1a. Both samples from HPC synthesis
calcined at 800 °C instead are characterized by a higher phase
purity.

In the samples annealed at 1000 and 1200 °C, all
main peaks
can be assigned to the orthorhombic perovskite CaTiO3 phase,
with rutile TiO2 and Ca(OH)2 as minor impurities,
more appreciable in AA samples. The addition of HPC seems instead
to promote the perovskite phase, leading in most cases to pure orthorhombic
perovskite CaTiO3. As expected due to the low dopant content
adopted in this study (0.2%), XRPD patterns do not show consistent
evidence of a shift in the (112) peak position in Pr-doped samples
with respect to the undoped ones.

The obtained results are in
good agreement with Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure S2), showing
the characteristic vibration modes of CaTiO3 for all samples
calcined above 600 °C: the peaks at ca. 530 and 420 cm–1 are associated with the vibrations of Ca–O bonds18 and with the asymmetrical stretching vibration
of the Ti–O bond in TiO32– groups,19 respectively. Other peaks are appreciable, especially
at the lowest calcination temperatures. In the case of the AA series,
the characteristic peaks of CaCO3 calcite (713, 875, and
1410 cm–1) are appreciable at 600 and 800 °C,
in agreement with XRPD data. On the other hand, the HPC samples calcined
at 600 and 800 °C present as the main feature a broad band at
2900–3700 cm–1, characteristic of the stretching
vibration of hydroxyl groups, with its bending counterpart at 1635
cm–1. These HPC samples also present two peaks at
874 and 1439 cm–1, which might be related to amorphous
CaCO3 on the grounds of the absence of the component at
710 cm–1 and in agreement with XRPD results. Increasing
the calcination temperature leads to the appearance of peaks related
to Ca(OH)2 (3645, 1465, and 875 cm–1)
in the AA and HPC 1 g series. Interestingly, no peaks related to Ca(OH)2 are appreciable for the HPC 0.5 g series, also in agreement
with XRPD results showing only rutile TiO2 as minor contaminant
for both the undoped and doped samples of this series. It is interesting
to note that FTIR was able to detect Ca-rich species also in samples
whose XRPD patterns are consistent with those of pure orthorhombic
CaTiO3. Indeed local Ca excesses, such as isolated defects
or grouping with irregular periodicity, might not be appreciable from
XRPD analyses.20

2.2 Morphology
and Elemental Composition
Figure 2 reports the
scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of Pr-doped samples calcined
at 800 and 1200 °C. Figure 2a shows that the AA_800 sample presents micrometric,
flat agglomerates composed of sintered spherical particles that energy
dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping confirmed to be CaTiO3.
This sample is highly inhomogeneous, presenting also smaller and more
porous aggregates (not shown) mainly composed of CaO/Ca(OH)2. As appreciable from Figure 2b, increasing the calcination temperature seems to lead to
larger agglomerates.

Figure 2 SEM images of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples
calcined
at 800 (a, c, e) and 1200 °C (b, d, f): (a, b) AA, (c, d) HPC
0.5 g, and (e, f) HPC 1 g.

Samples obtained from the synthesis with HPC present a completely
different and more homogeneous morphology (Figure 2c–f). Both samples are made of looser
aggregates of polydispersed prismatic particles (Figure 2c,e). Although the HPC 0.5
g sample presents micrometric particles (Figure 2c), the sample synthesized with the highest
HPC content is composed of much smaller aggregates of nanometric particles
(Figure 2e). As a matter
of fact, the addition of HPC to homogeneous sols has been reported
to increase the surface area of the final powder due to its ability
to bind to the particle surface, preventing agglomeration between
particles because of steric hindrance.17,21,22 Interestingly, the effect of HPC on the sample morphology
is appreciable even at a calcination temperature significantly higher
than the degradation temperature of HPC, which occurs at around 400
°C.23 Further increasing the annealing
temperature leads to larger particles and sintering effects (Figure 2d,f).

EDX mapping
(Figure S3c,d) shows that
all of the elements (Ca, Ti, Pr, and O) are distributed homogeneously
in the powders synthesized with HPC, within the detection limits of
the EDX mapping. In the case of the AA sample, a less homogeneous
composition is appreciable (Figure S3a,b), as also confirmed by spot analyses of different aggregates (vide
supra). In all of the tested samples, no elemental impurities were
detected. The average measured Ca/Ti atomic ratios are in agreement
with nominal ones within experimental error. In the case of the CaTiO3:Pr3+ AA_800 sample, spot measurements detected
areas with much lower Ti content, which may be indicative of impurity
phases, as also supported by XRPD results (vide supra). A precise
Pr quantification is difficult considering the low dopant nominal
content (0.2%) due to the limits of the analytical technique.

Total intensity cathodoluminescence (CL) images of HPC samples
show that the light is emitted homogeneously from the entire sample
(Figure 3). Barycenter
images display the dominant wavelength of emission, which is, for
each powder, constant throughout the sample. Local spectra compare
the emission peaks detected in spots of the sample presenting a low
and high emission intensity, respectively; they clearly show that
the wavelength of emission is fully comparable also among areas of
the sample showing different emission intensities. In the case of
the AA sample calcined at 800 °C, CL mapping (Figure S4) reveals areas of very low emission intensity, which
can be related to the poor homogeneity shown by XRPD and SEM-EDX results.

the maximum emission wavelength, the barycenter and the local spectra
of the CaTiO3:Pr3+ sample HPC 1 g _800. The
relative SEM image is reported in Figure S3.

2.3 Optical
Properties
The light absorption
features of the undoped and doped samples were investigated by UV–vis
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) (Figure 4).

Figure 4 DRS spectra in reflectance (a) and Kubelka–Munk
units (b)
of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples calcined at 1200 °C.

Figure 4 shows absorption
features at 450–500 nm, which correspond to 3H4 → 3PJ (J = 2, 1, 0) and 3H4 → 1I6 transitions of Pr3+ ions.24 The valence-to-conduction band edges are appreciable
at ca. 335 nm. In addition, a shoulder at longer wavelength (band
edge at about 375 nm) is observed, in agreement with previous reports.25,26 Interestingly, the intensity ratio between the two absorption bands
is different for the HPC 0.5 g sample with respect to AA and HPC 1
g. The origin of this band will be discussed in depth in Section 2.4.

The
apparent band gap values, as determined by Tauc’s plots
assuming a direct band gap transition,27 are reported in Table S1. They tend to
decrease as a function of the annealing temperature. Calculated values
for samples annealed above 800 °C are in the range 3.5–3.6
eV, fully comparable with the literature values for CaTiO3.27−29

2.4 Photoluminescence (PL)
Figure 5 reports the excitation and
emission PL spectra measured at room temperature for each sample.

Figure 5 Excitation
and emission spectra of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples
annealed at different temperatures: (a) AA, (b) HPC 0.5
g, and (c) HPC 1 g.

The shape of the excitation
and emission peaks of the CaTiO3:Pr3+ AA samples
does not vary by changing the
annealing temperature, apart from a slight red shift of the excitation
spectra. As for the samples synthesized with HPC, a different trend
is observed. Although the peak shapes of samples annealed at 800,
1000, and 1200 °C are very similar, the samples obtained at 600
°C show an almost featureless excitation spectra, as expected
due to their high amorphous content (see XRPD results).

All
of the samples show a main excitation band at ca. 330 nm, which
is consistent with the absorption edge of the diffuse reflectance
spectra and can be attributed to the valence band to conduction band
transition (Ti4+–O2– →
Ti3+–O–). Furthermore, an additional
band at 280 nm is appreciable, which can be attributed to the lowest
field component of the 5d state of Pr3+.30 In addition, both AA and HPC 1 g samples show an excitation
peak at 380 nm (26 300 cm–1), coincident
with the shoulder observed in DRS spectra (Figure 4), which is generally assigned to a low-lying
Pr-to-metal (Pr3+–Ti4+) intervalence
charge-transfer state.1,6 Interestingly, this peak is not
appreciable in the excitation spectra of HPC 0.5 g samples. It is
noteworthy that the apparent red shift of the main excitation peak
of AA and HPC 1 g samples mirrors the progressive increase of the
component at 380 nm. The relative intensity of the peak at 380 nm
with respect to the one at 330 nm has been reported to depend on synthetic
conditions, such as the calcination temperature,30 deposition in film,3 and local
Ca excesses.20 In particular, Otal and
co-workers showed a progressive increase of the relative intensity
of the peak at 380 nm with local Ca excess.20 The relative intensity of the peaks depends in fact on the relative
concentrations of Pr3+, Pr4+, and Ti3+ in the host CaTiO3, which vary with the synthetic conditions.30 It should be noted that with respect to HPC
0.5 g samples, the HPC 1 g and AA series showed appreciable impurities
of Ca-rich phases, such as Ca(OH)2 (see XRPD and FTIR results).

On the other hand, the shape of emission spectra is comparable
for all of the samples. The peak at 628 nm can be attributed to 4f2–4f2 transitions of Pr3+ ions
from the excited state 1D2 to the ground state 3H4,25,31 whereas the much less intense
peak at 700 nm is due to 1D2–3H5 transitions (Figure S5).

Table 1 reports
the absolute PL quantum yield (QY) values of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples calcined at 800, 1000, and 1200 °C. Samples
calcined at 600 °C were not analyzed due to their low PL intensity.

Table 1 Absolute Quantum Yield Values for
the Three Series of CaTiO3:Pr3+ Samples
sample	calcination temperature (°C)	QY (%)	
AA	800	5.4	
1000	7.9	
1200	10.2	
HPC 0.5 g	800	5.4	
1000	10.5	
1200	6.9	
HPC 1 g	800	N.A.	
1000	10.5	
1200	9.7	
A
marked difference is appreciable between the AA and HPC sample
series. For AA samples, QY values increase monotonically as a function
of the calcination temperature, reaching a maximum for the sample
treated at 1200 °C. In the case of samples from the HPC synthesis,
instead, the highest QY values are reached at the annealing temperature
of 1000 °C. In the case of the AA series, the increase of QY
with the calcination temperature can be related to the higher phase
purity obtained at higher annealing temperatures. No similar trends
can be observed for QY values of HPC samples, possibly because these
samples show comparable CaTiO3 phase content at the three
investigated calcination temperatures and because of the occurrence
of sintering effects at increasing calcination temperatures. The absolute
QY of the top performing samples of the three series are quite comparable
(ca. 10.5%), which are higher than that in the previous literature
reports concerning CaTiO3:Pr3+ micrometric materials
with the same dopant content19 and higher
or comparable to other lanthanide-doped CaTiO3 phosphors
with same dopant amounts.32,33 It should be noted
that several factors influence the reliable evaluation of absolute
QY values of powder samples, which are highly scattering materials.
Absolute quantum yields can be determined by the integrated sphere
method. However, several factors can affect the measurement, especially
reabsorption effects,34 which require a
careful optimization of the measurement setup.35

2.5 Effect of Temperature on
Photoluminescence
With the purpose of investigating the sample
luminescence behavior
at different temperatures, PL spectra of samples calcined at 1200
°C were measured in the −263/77 °C temperature range
(Figures S6 and S7). PL spectra measured
in the −263/–73 °C range are characterized by narrow
peaks typical of the 4f–4f transitions in lanthanides, whereas,
as expected, at higher temperatures, peaks become broader and less
intense. Emission spectra recorded at low temperatures (−263
°C) show nine components, in agreement with the Stark splitting
of 1D2 and 3H4 manifolds
of the Pr3+ ion at low temperature.3 Spectral shapes are similar among different samples, with the notable
exception of the excitation spectra of HPC 0.5 g samples (vide supra),
as particularly evident at −263 °C.

A temperature-dependent
line broadening of emission transitions is expected due to the electron
distribution in vibrational levels at thermal equilibrium. However,
although thermal line broadening should decrease the peak height as
a function of temperature, the total emission intensity should be
instead independent of temperature unless thermal quenching of the
emission occurs. In the present case, a temperature dependence of
the total emission intensity was observed (Figure 6), in agreement with previous reports.6,36 The increase in total emission intensity with temperature, observed
especially for the HPC 0.5 g sample, might indicate that the electron
transfer process is thermally activated. Above a certain temperature,
thermal quenching effects become dominant for all samples. Figure 6 shows that the energy
barrier for thermal quenching varies among the different samples:
the maximum total emission is observed at −196 °C for
the sample AA_1200, at −263 °C for HPC 1 g_1200, and at
−123 °C for HPC 0.5 g_1200. This implies that the temperature
dependence of luminescence can be controlled, for example, by changing
the synthetic condition. Inaguma et al.36 reported that the emission upon band gap excitation is promoted
with increasing temperature and attributed this phenomenon to a thermally
activated electron transfer from the ground state of Pr3+ ion, 3H4, to the valence band. They instead
observed a much more limited temperature dependence of emission intensity
upon photoexcitation with a wavelength of 375 nm. Interestingly, the
HPC 0.5 g sample, which lacks the excitation band at 375 nm, shows
a higher activation energy from the 4fn state to its cross-over with the quenching state.

(excitation at 328 nm) as a function of
the measurement temperature for CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples
calcined at 1200 °C.

2.6 Luminescence Decay
Figure 7 compares the luminescence
decay curves of 1D2–3H4 transitions in samples calcined at 1200 °C. The relative
fitting parameters and the fraction of slow decay, f3, are reported in Table 2.

Figure 7 Luminescence decay curves of 1D2–3H4 peaks of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples
calcined at 1200 °C.

Table 2 Decay Parameters of the 1D2–3H4 Transition for CaTiO3:Pr3+ Samples
Calcined at 1200 °C
sample	I1 (au)	τ1 (μs)	I2 (au)	τ2 (μs)	I3 (au)	τ3 (μs)	f3	
AA	0.97	53	0.002	387	0.0026	5808	0.20	
HPC 0.5 g	0.38	57	0.007	375	0.0007	2592	0.07	
HPC 1 g	0.80	50	0.023	387	0.0010	5418	0.10	
For all samples, three exponential
components turned out to be
necessary for a good fit, revealing similar decay times for the different
samples, of the order of 50 μs, 380 μs, and a few thousand
microseconds. Different decay components of luminescent emission are
typically reminiscent of dopants in different environments in the
host lattice. The “slow” component in Table 2 should probably be interpreted
as the first part of the afterglow; the fact that the “AA”
sample has the largest fraction of slow decay nicely fits the fact
that the afterglow is longest for this sample. The HPC 0.5 g sample
shows the lowest f3 value; these results
are compatible with afterglow decay times (vide infra) and a possible
explanation will be discussed in Section 2.7. Given the limited amount of data, only
the orders of magnitude of the decay times in Table 2 should be trusted, and the absolute values
should only be interpreted as approximations.

The effect of
temperature on the luminescence decay was also investigated. Figure S8 compares the luminescence decay curves
measured at −263 °C of 1D2–3H4 peaks of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples
calcined at 1200 °C. A faster decay was consistently observed
at −263 °C than at room temperature (Table S2), in agreement with previous reports about CaTiO3:Pr3+.37 The longer
lifetimes observed at room temperature with respect to those at −263
°C can be considered the result of a thermal-activated process,
involving charge storage from shallow surface traps.37 This latter mechanism would be inefficient at low temperatures
because of the deficiency of thermally released energy.

2.7 Afterglow Properties
Persistent luminescence
emission spectra measured at room temperature (not shown) are consistent
with photoluminescence, indicating that the afterglow results from
the 1D2–3H4 transition
of Pr3+. Figure 8 reports the afterglow decay curves of the three sets of samples.

Figure 8 Afterglow
decay curves of CaTiO3:Pr3+samples
calcined at 600 (light blue line), 800 (blue), 1000 (green), and 1200
°C (red): (a) AA, (b) HPC 0.5 g, and (c) HPC 1 g.

At the annealing temperature of 600 °C, only
the AA sample
presents a limited afterglow, whereas the HPC samples do not show
afterglow emission as expected on grounds of their amorphous nature.

All of the samples calcined at temperatures ≥800 °C
present appreciable afterglow emission. The slowest decay of afterglow
is observed for CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples calcined
at intermediate calcination temperatures: 800 °C (AA and HPC
1 g) and 1000 °C (HPC 0.5 g). These findings are also supported
by the decay times of the phosphors (Table 3).

Table 3 Decay Times of Phosphor
(Time until
the Luminance Has Decayed to 0.32 mcd m–2) for Different
CaTiO3:Pr3+ Samples
 	t (s)	
calcination temperature (°C)	AA	HPC 0.5 g	HPC 1 g	
600	92	3	9	
800	737	221	442	
1000	246	278	248	
1200	374	155	199	
The decay times of
the phosphor for AA samples are generally higher
than those of the other samples, whereas HPC 0.5 g samples presents
the lowest. The highest decay time is shown by the AA_800 phosphor,
which presents a decay time higher than that in previous literature
reports.20,38 It is worth noting that AA samples have
the highest content of impurity phases, in particular Ca-rich ones,
whereas HPC 0.5 g samples consistently showed the absence of Ca excess.
The presence of local Ca excess has been related to the favored formation
of oxygen vacancies that are known to act as charge-carrier traps,
increasing decay times.6,20,30 This supports the observation that the ideal preparation conditions
for a phosphor strongly depend on the area of application: to improve
the steady-state luminescence, the number of defects should be minimized,
whereas such defects are essential for obtaining a high afterglow
time and intensity.

Figure 9 compares
the total light output of the different samples. The total light output
in the entire investigated range (from 10 to 3600 s, Figure 9a) is compared with the slow
afterglow (100–3600 s, Figure 9b).

Figure 9 Total light output during afterglow measurements of CaTiO3:Pr3+ samples as a function their calcination temperature:
(a) light emission from 10 to 3600 s (total afterglow) and (b) light
emission from 100 to 3600 s (slow afterglow).

The trend of the slow afterglow (Figure 9b) is different from the total light output
in the entire range (Figure 9a). As a matter of fact, the highest total light output in Figure 9a is shown by the
sample AA_1000, whereas in the slow afterglow (100–3600 s),
it is shown by AA_800. Such a difference shows that for the sample
calcined at 1000 °C, almost all of the light comes out in the
first few minutes,
possibly as a result of shallower traps.

The fact that the optimum
annealing temperature for the afterglow
properties of the AA series is 800 °C, whereas it is 1200 °C
for steady-state luminescence, can be attributed to a competition
between two effects: on one hand, a higher processing temperature
leads to a better phase purity, which enhances the luminescent intensity
and decreases nonradiative recombination. On the other hand, the afterglow
is dependent on the existence of some intrinsic electronic and/or
structural defects, which are decreasing in number with higher annealing
temperatures. The persistent luminescence intensity is proportional
to the number of traps for energy storage and to the recombination
efficiency of the released carriers with luminescent centers. The
nature of energy storage trapping centers in CaTiO3:Pr3+ has been attributed to different mechanisms; the Pr3+ dopant itself acts as a hole trap and
Pr4+ and oxygen vacancies as electron-traps.6,30 The highest persistent luminescence intensity is observed for the
samples prepared at 800 °C, owing to the high number of defects
promoting afterglow. A further increase in the calcination temperature
reduces the impurity content, in particular of Ca-rich phases, which
might result in a loss of oxygen vacancies.39 As a result, the afterglow emission is reduced.

The calcination
temperature has a strong influence on the afterglow
properties of sample CaTiO3:Pr3+ AA and a lower
influence on the samples synthesized with HPC, mirroring the diverse
effect of calcination temperature on phase purity for the two sets
of samples. Further, the samples synthesized with acetic acid showed
values of total light output higher than those of the samples synthesized
with HPC (also in agreement with decay times of the phosphors). This
higher persistent luminescence might be the result of more defective
crystals for samples of the AA series, related to their higher content
of Ca-rich phases and local Ca excess.

3 Conclusions
In this work, two sol–gel synthetic routes for the preparation
of CaTiO3:Pr3+ were developed. The role of the
calcination temperature on the material properties was investigated
in a wide temperature range (600–1200 °C). The desired
perovskite phase was obtained at a calcination temperature of 800
°C or higher. The presence of HPC, able to adsorb at the oxide
surface reducing coalescence via enhanced steric hindrance, results
in smaller, less aggregated particles as well as in a high phase purity.
The AA synthesis instead leads to micrometric particles with heterogeneous
composition. The role of the HPC content was also investigated, showing
that increasing the HPC content further reduces the particle size
and agglomeration. Interestingly, the sample with the highest HPC
content shows the presence of Ca-rich impurities, as determined by
attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
analyses; although no segregated Ca-rich phases were appreciable from
XRPD analyses, these effects might be traced back to a higher presence
of surface defects in this sample. PL measurements showed that luminescence
properties are mainly related to the phase purity of the oxide. The
presence of Ca excess, resulting in oxygen vacancies, was related
to effects on the samples’ absorption and excitation spectra.
On the other hand, a more complex effect was found on persistent luminescence
properties. Although the samples calcined at the lowest temperature
showed a negligible afterglow emission, the highest energy storage
capability was exhibited by the CaTiO3:Pr3+ AA
sample calcined at 800 °C. This indicates that a good degree
of crystallization is needed for both steady-state PL and afterglow.
However, annealing at 1200 °C leads to a diffusion degree that
is too high for the afterglow phenomenon to occur. As a matter of
fact, persistent luminescence requires the presence of trap levels,
which are related to lattice defects, such as oxygen vacancies. The
synthetic procedure played a significant role in the afterglow emission:
samples from the synthesis with acetic acid showed the highest persistent
luminescence, possibly as a result of the presence of local Ca excess,
whereas the HPC 0.5 g samples showed the lowest afterglow.

Therefore,
samples from the acetic acid synthesis are better candidates
as red persistent phosphors. On the other hand, considering their
high luminescent emission, low afterglow, and smaller particles, samples
from HPC synthesis may be considered the most promising red phosphors
for display applications.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Materials Synthesis
Reagents were
of analytical grade; they were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used
without further purification. MilliQ water was used to prepare solutions
and suspensions.

CaTiO3:Pr3+ powders were
synthesized by the sol–gel method, followed by calcination
at different temperatures. Two different synthetic procedures were
compared: an acetic acid-based route and an HPC-based route. In both
synthetic approaches, the precursor materials were CaCO3, titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) and PrCl3. The Pr/Ti
molar ratio was fixed to 0.2% to limit concentration quenching effects.31 Undoped CaTiO3 samples were also
synthesized as reference. The general procedure was the following:
3.7 mL of a 0.02 M PrCl3 acidic solution (prepared in HCl
0.1 M) was added to 10.84 g of TTIP while stirring continuously and
using an ice bath. Then, 11.52 g of 2-propanol was added, leading
to the formation of a transparent sol. Subsequently, a CaCO3 solution was added drop-by-drop to the reaction mixture in 30 min.
The reaction mixture was then stirred for 90 min and dried in an oven
for 24 h at 70 °C. The obtained xerogels were calcined at different
temperatures (600, 800, 1000, and 1200 °C) for 4 h in an unventilated
oven, using a 3.3 °C min–1 heating rate.

The two synthetic approaches differed only in the preparation of
the CaCO3 solution. In the acetic acid-based approach,
3.72 g of CaCO3 were mixed with 10.52 g of glacial acetic
acid. In the HPC-based approach, 3.72 g of CaCO3 was added
to an aqueous HPC solution, prepared dissolving the chosen amount
of HPC (MW ∼ 100 000) in
66.6 mL of water, and ca. 10 mL of HCl (37%) was introduced to obtain
a clear solution. To investigate the effect of the HPC content on
the final properties of the CaTiO3 material, two different
amounts of HPC were tested (1 and 0.5 g).

In the following,
samples will be labeled as AA_x, HPC 1 g_x and HPC 0.5 g_x, where x is the calcination temperature.

4.2 Characterization
Techniques
X-ray
powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns were acquired at room temperature
using a Siemens D5000 Bragg-Brentano goniometer graphite-monochromated
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) at 40 kV × 40 mA
nominal X-rays power. θ:2θ scans were performed between
10 to 90°, with step sizes 0.01–0.04° wide.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements were
carried out using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 ATR-FTIR spectrometer.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were acquired with a
Zeiss LEO 1430 (30 keV), equipped with a backscattered electron detector
as well as an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis system. Specimens
were coated with an Au thin film to reduce charging effects.

Cathodoluminescence (CL) and EDX mapping images were collected
with a Hitachi S3400N scanning electron microscope operating at 15
kV, equipped with an optical fiber, and analyzed using an EMCCD camera
(Princeton Instruments ProEM 16002) attached
to a Princeton Instruments Acton SP2358 spectrograph.

Diffuse
reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) analyses were performed
on a Shimadzu UV2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer equipped with
an integrating sphere. Spectra were acquired in the range of 250–750
nm, using BaSO4 as a total white reference. Band gap values
were estimated by Tauc’s plots.40

Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed using an
FS920
fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments). Measurements at
different temperatures were carried out using an Oxford Optistat CF
cryostat. The total emission intensity was measured using the same
setup of PL measurements, keeping the same geometry during every measurement
and integrating the spectra over the 550–700 nm wavelength
range.

Absolute PL quantum yield determinations were carried
out with
a Quantaurus-QY spectrometer (Hamamatsu), equipped with an integrating
sphere. Samples were placed in optical quartz cells, used as reference.
Excitation wavelengths were varied in the range of 230–360
nm (10 nm for each measurement); the maximum QY values were always
determined in the 320–330 nm range. The emitted fluorescence
in the range of 580–750 nm was detected by a multichannel detector.
Measurements were performed at room temperature, according to a previously
reported experimental setup.41

Luminescence
decay measurements were conducted with an Intensified
Charge Coupled Device (ICCD) Andor DH720 at two different temperatures
(room temperature and −263 °C) by using an Oxford Optistat
CF cryostat. Excitation was performed using a pulsed nitrogen laser
(wavelength 337 nm, pulse duration <1 ns, pulse frequency 1 Hz),
and detection was carried out at 612 nm. The response time of the
detection system was determined by the laser pulse width and the switching
time of the ICCD image intensifier (3 ns), leading to an overall response
time of less than 5 ns, which is orders of magnitude below the time
scale of the observed phenomena. After noise removal, the peaks of
the different transitions were integrated and the decay curve was
fitted as a function of time t by a triple exponential 1  where I is the luminescence
intensity, I1, I2, and I3 are the amplitudes for
each component, and τ1, τ2, and
τ3 are the decay constants of the three components,
respectively. From the determined amplitudes and decay constants,
the fraction of slow decay, f3, was determined
according to the following equation 2  The persistent
luminescence analysis was conducted
by irradiating the sample with an unfiltered 150 W short arc xenon
lamp (LOT Quantum Devices) at an illumination intensity of 1000 lx
for 5 min and then measuring its afterglow emission for 1 h with an
International Light Technology ILT1700 photometer, equipped with an
SPM68 detector calibrated in cd m–2. The decay time
of the phosphor was determined as the time in which its emission decays
to 0.32 mcd m–2 (3.2 × 10–4 cd m–2).
