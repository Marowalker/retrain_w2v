The interaction between
dendritic polyglycerol sulfate (dPGS) of
the second generation and lysozyme was studied by isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC) at different temperatures and salt concentrations.
Analysis by ITC showed that 2–3 lysozyme molecules were bound
to each dPGS. The resulting binding constant Kb and the Gibbs free energy ΔGo decreased markedly with increasing salt concentration but were nearly
independent of temperature. The salt dependence of Kb led to the conclusion that ca. 3 counterions bound to
dPGS were released upon complex formation. The gain in entropy ΔGci by this counterion-release scales logarithmically
with salt concentration and is the main driving force for binding.
The temperature dependence of ΔGo was analyzed by the nonlinear van’t Hoff plot, taking into
account a finite heat capacity change ΔCp,vH. This evaluation led to the binding enthalpy
ΔHvH and the binding entropy ΔSvH. Both quantities varied strongly with temperature
and even changed sign, but they compensated each other throughout
the entire range of temperature. Coarse-grained computer simulations
with explicit salt and implicit water were used to obtain the binding
free energies that agreed with ITC results. Thus, electrostatic factors
were the driving forces for binding whereas all hydration contributions
leading to the strongly varying ΔHvH and ΔSvH canceled out. The calorimetric
enthalpy ΔHITC measured directly
by ITC differed largely from ΔHvH. ITC measurements done in two buffer systems with different ionization
enthalpies revealed that binding was linked to buffer ionization and
a partial protonation of the protein.

Introduction
The interaction of
proteins with polyelectrolytes is a long-standing
subject in biochemistry, drug design, and materials science.1−5 Many biopolymers, for example DNA, are highly charged and interact
with proteins via electrostatic forces.6 Proteins may form complexes with natural or synthetic polyelectrolytes
of opposite charge (”complex coacervates” cf. refs (2) and (3)) that have applications
as food colloids.5 Central to this field
is the investigation of the equilibrium binding constant between a
given protein and a polyelectrolyte in order to explore the various
thermodynamic factors that lead to binding. Isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) has become a pivotal technique to explore the thermodynamics
of ligands binding with proteins.7−9 The heat signal measured
directly by ITC can be converted to the binding constant Kb, the temperature dependence of which may then yield
the enthalpy and entropy of binding ΔHb and ΔSb, respectively.10−12 The total heat ΔHITC also furnished
by ITC need not agree with ΔHb because
linked equilibria may also contribute to the heat signal.13,14 It is thus evident that ITC can be used to explore the full thermodynamics
of binding between polyelectrolytes and proteins. However, the use
of these data for the design of drugs may be difficult and in parts
questionable.15 Additional information
furnished by computer simulations using coarse-grained (CG) and molecular
models would clearly be helpful to clarify the details of binding
in order to use these data for drug design and for predicting the
binding constants of polyelectrolytes to a given protein.

We
have recently shown that ITC data can directly be combined with
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.16 As
a model polyelectrolyte, we used the dendritic polyglycerol sulfate
(dPGS). The scaffold of these dPGS dendrimers is made up from a hyperbranched
polyglycerol core. Sulfate groups attached to all terminals render
these molecules very hydrophilic and highly charged. dPGS has been
shown to be promising drug and carrier recently.17−23 It has also been the subject of a comprehensive study by computer
simulation24 and can be considered a well-controlled
model polyelectrolyte. Figure 1 displays the chemical structure of a dPGS. The synthesized
dPGS with a hyperbranched structure25 comes
close to the perfect dPGS dendrimer of generation 2 (see the discussion
in ref (24)).

positive, negative, and neutral amino acids, respectively. (c) Idealized
sketch of the dPGS–Lys complex taking all molecules as spheres.
The overall positive lysozymes and negative dPGS are characterized
with blue and red surfaces, respectively. The stoichiometry of complexation
is ∼3 at 310 K and 10 mM salt purely driven by electrostatic
interaction.16

In our recent study, ITC and computer simulations with implicit
water were used to study the binding of lysozyme to dPGS of different
generations.16 This investigation demonstrated
that the interaction of the dPGS dendrimers with proteins can be traced
back mainly to electrostatic effects. The main part of the electrostatic
interaction was shown to be counterion-release: a part of the counterions
condensed to the polyelectrolyte dPGS24 is released upon binding of the protein. Counterion condensation
and release influence the thermodynamics of a polyelectrolyte and
its complex formation with other molecules.27 The released counterions increase the entropy of the system. The
decrease of Gibbs free energy ΔGo scales therefore with ln cs, where cs denotes the salt concentration in the solution.6,28 In addition to this, the screened electrostatic attraction on the
Debye–Hückel (DH) level between the negatively charged
dPGS and the positively charged lysozyme plays a role at low concentration
of added salt.16 We found that the binding
constant derived from MD-simulations with explicit ions but implicit
water fully agreed with the experimental values derived by ITC. The
same result was obtained in a recent study of the binding of poly(acrylic
acid) to human serum albumin (HSA) by both ITC and computer simulations.29 These findings led to the conclusion that electrostatic
terms dominate the binding of charged polymers to proteins to a large
extend.

To elucidate this point further, we have recently performed
a comprehensive
thermodynamic investigation of the binding of HSA to dPGS by ITC.30 The binding constant Kb was measured at different temperatures at low salt concentration.
In addition to this, the dependence of the binding constant on salt
concentration was determined. Then, the analysis on the binding constant Kb of the 1:1 complex of HSA and dPGS-G2 demonstrated
that the binding free energy depended hardly on temperature. However,
both the binding enthalpy and entropy were found to vary strongly
with temperature but compensated each other. This enthalpy–entropy
compensation (EEC) has been observed in many systems by now15,31−35 and is related to a high value of the heat capacity change ΔCp. It is clearly seen also
in systems of biological relevance.10−12

Here, we extend
these investigations to the binding of dPGS-G2
to lysozyme using again a systematic variation of both the salt concentration
and the temperature. In this way, the electrostatic factors contributing
to binding can be separated from hydrophilic/hydrophobic hydration/dehydration.
The EEC can hence be studied in detail for this system, which will
allow us to discuss the role of thermodynamic quantities for predicting
the interaction of proteins with highly charged macromolecules. In
addition to these experimental studies, we extend our previous MD
simulations of the system dPGS/lysozyme.16 Special effort is laid to the direct comparison of the data obtained
by experiments and simulations. In this context, it is revealing to
consider the various contributions to the enthalpy ΔHITC measured directly by ITC. The entire set
of data will allow us a comprehensive discussion of the use of thermodynamic
data when discussing and predicting thermodynamic equilibria between
proteins and highly charged macromolecules.

Results and Discussion
The complex formation of lysozyme with dPGS of different generations
was studied recently by ITC and computer simulations at 310 K and
10 mM salt concentration.16 Lysozyme has
a net charge of +8 e at physiological pH. The synthetic
dPGS-G2 bears −28 e total charges while its
effective charge is −11 e in solution because
of counterion condensation.24Figure 1 sketches the adsorption
process for dPGS-G2. We found that approximately 3 lysozyme molecules
and 1 dPGS form a complex with Kb ≈
108 M–1 at 10 mM salt.16 The sulfate terminal groups bind with positive patch on
the protein, thereby releasing ca. 3 counterions bound to dPGS. In
the present work, all binding experiments are done in phosphate buffer
whereas the experiments in ref (16) were done in 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid (MOPS) buffer. Here, we chose the phosphate buffer because the
adjusted pH hardly changes with temperature.36 In addition, the use of different buffers will allow us to discern
possible heat contributions from the buffer aside from binding.13,14

The raw data of the titration peaks and the respective isotherms
at 310 K and cs = 50, 100, 150 mM are
shown in Figure 2.
The interaction is exothermic under all conditions. All the parameters
including binding number N, binding constant Kb, and ITC enthalpy ΔHITC could be obtained very well by fitting the data with
the single set of identical sites (SSIS) model.37Figure 3 gives a survey of all ITC isotherms together with the respective
fits referring to all salt concentrations and temperatures under consideration
here. Table 1 summarizes
all fit parameters obtained from ITC experiments. The number N of bound lysozyme molecules decreases slightly with salt
concentration but stays approximately constant with temperature. In
the present salt concentration of 25 mM, it is found slightly smaller
than previously observed 3–4 in 10 mM MOPS buffer.16 The binding affinity of lysozyme with dPGS decreases
with salt concentration as expected. Table 1 furthermore shows that the binding free
energy ΔGo hardly changes with temperature
but decreases significantly with increasing ionic strength.

Electrostatic and Steric Contributions to
the Binding Affinity
The electrostatic interaction between
oppositely charged polyelectrolytes
has been used for many decades in areas such as multilayer film formation.38,39 In our previous study, we discussed the electrostatic contributions
to the binding between dPGS and lysozyme. On the basis of a comparison
of ITC data with MD simulations, we found that the binding was mainly
driven by counterion-release.16 Simulations
of the highly charged dPGS dendrimers24 demonstrated that there was a thin shell or Stern layer of condensed
counterions on the surface of the dendrimers. From this, a surface
concentration of condensed counterions cci can be estimated (see Table S3 of ref (16)). In the case of G2, cci = 0.96 M is much higher than the salt concentrations in
bulk used here in the ITC-runs. When lysozyme is bound to dPGS, the
positive patch on the surface of the protein becomes a multivalent
counterion to the dendrimer. A concomitant number of the condensed
counterions of dPGS are thereby released into the bulk solution. The
corresponding gain of entropy follows as 1  where cci and cs are the concentrations
of local condensed
counterions and bulk salt, respectively, and ΔNci is the number of released counterions.16,40 From this, it follows that the binding constant is related to ΔNci if counterion-release is a dominant driving
force6,28 2  

Figure 4 presents the dependence of the binding constant on
salt concentration. The number of released counterions ranges between
2.5 and 2.7 (data referring to other temperatures are shown in the Supporting Information), which is in accord with
our previous result where ΔNci =
3.1 in MOPS buffer at 310 K.16 The released
counterions from the dPGS surface upon binding can also be monitored
by computer simulations,16 and the results
agree with experiments (see Supporting Information). Because cci equals to 0.96 M at 310
K for dPGS-G2,24eq 1 predicts ΔGci at 25 mM salt concentration to be −9.8 kBT. It hence presents a major contribution
in the total binding free energy. The solid lines in Figure 4 referring to different temperatures
are approximately parallel so the number of released counterions does
not depend on temperature within the limits of error. It thus demonstrates
that counterion-release does not contribute to the heat capacity ΔCp on this level of approximation.

Figure 4 Dependence
of binding constant on salt concentration for three
different temperatures. The number of released counterions ΔNci from the slope of these lines fitted according
to eq 2 is 2.5 ±
0.1 at 278 K, 2.6 ± 0.1 at 293 K, and 2.7 ± 0.1 at 310 K
in phosphate buffer. ΔNci measured
in MOPS buffer at 310 K is 3.1 ± 0.1.16

In addition to counterion-release,
there is a DH attraction ΔGele between
dPGS and the bound lysozyme. Moreover,
there is an electrostatic repulsion between bound proteins. Considering
all the charged beads individually, the pairwise charge–charge
interaction on the DH level was summarized by computer simulation.16 The resultant overall electrostatic interaction
between lysozyme and dPGS-G2 was attractive and decreased slightly
with the uptake of bound proteins. For the first three bound proteins
at cs = 10 mM, the attraction was found
similar to be −26 kJ/mol (−10 kBT) (see Figure 2D in ref (16)).

Steric repulsion
between the bound lysozymes enters as a third
term. This packing penalty is non-existent for the first uptake and
positive for the subsequent proteins. It becomes a limiting factor
when the packing of the proteins leads to a more or less full coverage
of the surface. For the situation encountered for G2 where 4 lysozymes
are bound, simulations showed this term to be of minor importance.16

The findings above lead to the conclusion
that the binding free
energy of subsequent lysozymes is not a constant but decreases with
the number of bound proteins. The Langmuir model which is the basis
of the SSIS fitting, on the other hand, assumes that each bound protein
is attached independently and the free energy of binding is equivalent
for all bound proteins.

To elucidate the cooperativity in a
multivalent binding, we measured
the complexation of lysozyme with dPGS-G2 for different coordination
numbers i by MD simulations. Figure 5 shows the potential of mean force (PMF)
profile at 293 K and two salt concentrations. The respective local
minimum reveals the binding distance rb and binding free energy ΔGbsim at the given coordination number.
The complexation between dPGS and the first bound lysozyme is purely
driven by electrostatic effects with a binding free energy −27 kBT at 10 mM salt (see the discussion
of Figure 2C in ref (16)). The magnitude of ΔGbsim decreases with i, which indicates a negative cooperativity caused by electrostatic
repulsion and steric hindrance.

Figure 5 PMF curves βΔVi for the complexation between dPGS-G2
and lysozyme vs the dPGS–lysozyme
center of mass distance r. ΔVi is in the unit of kBT (β = 1/kBT). The binding coordination number i ranges from 1 to 4 as indicated in the graph. The simulation
was done at T = 293 K and salt concentration cs = 25 mM (lower panel) and 150 mM (upper panel).

To account for this negative cooperativity,
we recently developed
a new way of comparing ΔGb between
the simulation and ITC experiments:16 in
canonical simulations, the concentration cbound of bound and non-interacting ligands follows as16 3  where cfree is
the concentration of free (unbound) ligands and Vb refers to the effective volume in which the bound ligands
are confined. ΔGb defines the transfer
free energy from bulk to the bound state, which can be taken directly
from the minimum of the PMF profile.16 We
now assume that the binding complex consists of i lysozyme ligands bound in a shell on the surface of dPGS which are
idealized as spheres. Hence, the binding volume Vb = 4π(rb)2δb. We take the binding distance rb = 2.5 nm at saturation together with the thickness of
the spherical binding shell δb = 1 nm.

In the
Langmuir model used for the evaluation of the experiments,
the protein coverage θ is defined as 4  with Kb = v0 exp(−βΔGo) the binding constant related to the Langmuir binding
free energy ΔGo in Table 1. Here, the volume prefactor v0 is defined to be 1 L/mol. Combination of eq 3 with 4 leads to the “simulation-referenced” Langmuir free energy by 5  which leads to
a direct comparison between
the experimental ITC curves and the simulations discussed previously.16 The degree of coverage θ* is obtained
from the inflection point of the ITC isotherms, where n(Lys)/n(dPGS) = N and is smaller
than unity.16

We apply this method
to the present data and find θ* at four
different conditions (see Supporting Information). ΔGbITC at the inflection point can then be calculated
with eq 5 and compared
to ΔGbsim in Figure 6. We find a full agreement between simulation and ITC
for all conditions. Thus, the experimental results can be rationalized
very well in terms of the simulations.

Figure 6 Binding free energy ΔGbsim vs the protein coverage θ
= i/Nsim, where i is the binding coordination number and Nsim is the binding stoichiometry from simulations. ΔGbsim values by simulations at different conditions are depicted by the
empty symbols. These results are compared with the “simulation-referenced”
Langmuir free energy ΔGbITC according to eq 5 at θ*, denoted by
the filled points.

It is interesting to
note that the data taken at higher salt concentration
exhibit a much weaker dependence on θ (squares in Figure 6) than the ones obtained for
lower salt concentrations (circles). This means that the binding affinity
at cs = 150 mM shows much lower negative
cooperativity, which can be traced back to the weaker DH interaction
in the presence of more salt. At the same time, the simulations confirm
a weak dependence of ΔGb on temperature
consistent with the experimental data.

A meaningful comparison
of ΔGo measured at different conditions
requires that θ* remains
constant under all conditions. Table 1 shows that the number N of bound
lysozymes measured for a given salt concentration does not depend
on temperature. Therefore, the present set of data can be used to
discuss the dependence on temperature without restrictions. There
are small changes of N for a given temperature when
going from low salt concentrations to higher ones. However, this change
can be disregarded in good approximation. Hence, the data gathered
in Table 1 allow us
to discuss the dependence of ΔGo on both salt concentration and temperature which is done in the
following.

Enthalpy–Entropy Compensation
As discussed above,
the accuracy of the obtained ΔGo is fully sufficient for a meaningful analysis of the dependence
on T. Previous work on complex formation of proteins
with nucleic acids has clearly revealed that the binding enthalpy
depends markedly on temperature,11,12 which shows
that the heat capacity change ΔCp is of appreciable magnitude. Therefore, the binding
free energy must be rendered in terms of the nonlinear van’t
Hoff relation11,41 6  where ΔHvH,ref and ΔSvH,ref are
the binding enthalpy
and entropy, respectively, at a given reference temperature Tref.

The analysis of the data shown in Figure 7 according to eq 6 is done as follows: the
given temperature is chosen as reference temperature Tref, and the corresponding binding enthalpy ΔHvH,ref, entropy ΔSvH,ref, and heat capacity change ΔCp,vH are obtained as fit parameters. This
procedure is done for all temperatures under consideration here. The
values ΔHvH, ΔSvH, and ΔCp,vH obtained for all temperatures by this fit are listed in Table 1. Here, ΔCp,vH has been treated as a
freely floating parameter but the fit results are constant for each
salt concentration.

Figure 7 Nonlinear van’t Hoff analysis for dPGS–Lys
complexation
at different ionic strengths according to eq 6: 25 mM (•), 50 mM (▲), 75 mM
(▼), 100 mM (◀), 125 mM (▶), and 150 mM (■).
The counterion-release entropy gain ΔGci is calculated with ΔNci according to eq 1.

The curvature in Figure 7 which is due to the heat capacity
ΔCp,vH is similar
and the data are of sufficient
precision to determine this quantity. ΔCp,vH is constant in this range of temperature
and approximately −2 kJ/(mol K) for all the ionic strengths.
Both ΔHvH and ΔSvH change strongly with temperature, whereas ΔGo is nearly a constant. This insensitivity of
ΔGo to T necessarily
leads to a marked EEC considering a large ΔCp,vH.

Figure 7 also contains
the part ΔGci calculated for 25
and 150 mM salt by eq 1. The magnitude of ΔGci varies
linearly with temperature, which is obvious from eq 1: ΔSci =
ΔNcikB ln(cci/cs) does not depend on T if one disregards small change
of cci with temperature. The difference
between ΔGci and ΔGo is mainly due to the electrostatic interaction
ΔGele as discussed above and in
ref (16). At constant
temperature, for example 293 K, this electrostatic part can be read
off to be −19 kJ/mol at both 25 and 150 mM salt from Figure 7. It does not vanish
with added salt as expected for a simple DH-interaction. Thus, the
analytical modeling of the electrostatic interaction between the protein
adhering directly to the dendritic polyelectrolyte requires a more
detailed description containing higher order multipole terms. It should
be noted, however, that the simulation carries along all necessary
contributions because it fully agrees with the experimental data.

Figure 8 depicts
the entropic and enthalpic contributions in the total free energy
at all ionic strengths. It demonstrates directly the EEC. ΔHvH and ΔSvH even change sign in most cases in Figure 8, whereas ΔGo is almost constant. It is thus evident that
the EEC is leading to a nearly constant free energy of binding because
ΔHvH and TΔSvH run strictly parallel within the present
window of temperature. Hence, for our system, the enthalpic and entropic
changes with temperature due to hydration effects seem to cancel out
each other nearly completely. In general, EEC is a commonly observed
phenomenon for binding of polyelectrolytes with proteins.32,33,42 This effect has widely frustrated
the use of thermodynamic data for drug design.15 The present discussion underscores this problem and accentuates
that one should strive to calculate binding free energy rather than
enthalpic or entropic contributions individually.

Figure 8 Entropic (TΔSvH, black) and enthalpic (ΔHvH, red)
contributions in total free energy (ΔGo, blue) at different ionic strengths. The calorimetric enthalpy
ΔHITC (dashed red) is plotted as
a comparison to ΔHvH.

Figure 8 shows clearly
that ΔHvH deviates markedly from
the directly measured ΔHITC, which
is different from the dPGS–HSA binding system in our previous
study.30 It is well-known that ΔHITC measured directly in the calorimetry experiment
need not agree with the binding enthalpy ΔHvH.15,41,43−45 Explanations for this finding are based on the fact
that ΔHITC may also contain contributions
of linked equilibria such as ionization or conformational changes
of the protein or ligand. The next section will discuss the measured
enthalpy in more detail.

Binding Enthalpy Versus Calorimetric Enthalpy
The directly
measured ΔHITC rises with both temperature
and salt concentration (see Table 1). In general, the linear dependence of enthalpy ΔHITC on temperature corresponds to a heat capacity
change ΔCp,ITC. Figure 8 includes the linear
fitting at different salt concentrations. The exothermic process is
accompanied by a positive heat capacity change (see Table 1). Notably, ΔCp,ITC increases with salt concentration
similar to findings made for a protein–DNA binding system.46 The value increases with ionic strength thus
suggesting an exothermic process that is repressed by ions (see the
discussion of this point in ref (46)). Compared to ΔCp,ITC, the intrinsic part ΔCp,vH has opposite sign and does not depend
on ionic strength within the limits of error. This is indicative of
linked equilibria that compensate ΔCp,vH and gives overall positive ΔCp,ITC.

According to Kozlov and
Lohman, the observed enthalpy change by calorimetry can be split up
into several contributions as13 7  

Thus, the calorimetric enthalpy
contains the binding enthalpy ΔHvH, the protonation enthalpy of free or bound
protein/ligand ΔHprot, and the ionization
(deprotonation) enthalpy of the buffer ΔHion = ΔnH+ΔHiono with positive ΔnH+ being
the number of protons supplied by the buffer. ΔHiono is the
molar enthalpy of buffer deprotonation. Similarly, the temperature
dependence gives the observed ΔCp,ITC as13 8  

Here, ΔCp,vH is due to binding. The electrostatic
contribution to ΔCp is relatively small.47 The hydration
or dehydration of nonpolar and
polar solute gives large heat capacity change with different signs.48

Binding experiments done in two different
buffer solutions with
distinguishable ΔHiono allow us to calculate the caloric effect
of buffer ionization because the first two terms at the right side
of eq 7 remain unchanged.
Here, we compare the measured ΔHITC in MOPS obtained previously at 310 K and different ionic strengths16 and phosphate buffer done here. From these data,
the number of released protons at 310 K can be derived as 9  

The buffer
ionization enthalpies for dPGS–Lys interaction
at 310 K in phosphate buffer are summarized in Table 2 taking the data obtained with the MOPS buffer
as ref (16) ΔnH+ protons are released from the
buffer and it decreases with salt concentration. The positive ionization
enthalpy thus decreases with salt and is relatively small. Then, the
large discrepancy between ΔHITC and
ΔHvH must be traced back to a negative
ΔHprot. The protonation enthalpy
can also be estimated with ΔnH+ and given ΔHproto; however, it depends on the species
of amino acid.49 Here, we roughly estimate
the protonation enthalpy with ΔHproto of lysine and
arginine from the literature.49 The values
in Table 2 are in a
comparable range with the calculation according to eq 7, which indicates that positive
residues at the binding site may be protonated and the protonation
brings a large negative contribution to the measured enthalpy.

a ΔHITCMOPS* is taken
from previous measurements.16 According
to ref (36), the ionization
enthalpy ΔHion,MOPSo and ΔHion,phoso are 22.67
and 2.88 kJ/mol, respectively, at 310 K neglecting the salt dependence.
ΔnH+ can then be obtained
according to eq 9 and
ΔHion = ΔnH+ΔHion,phoso in phosphate buffer. ΔHprot is calculated with eq 7. The protonation enthalpy ΔHproto for arginine and lysine is −46 kJ/mol according to the literature.49 Thus, the protonation enthalpy in this system
can be calculated according to ΔHprot* = ΔnH+ΔHproto.

It should be kept in mind that the
binding of several lysozyme
molecules to a single dPGS is accompanied by a notable negative cooperativity.
This could be seen directly in Figure 6. ΔGo refers to the
situation where θ = θ*, that is, at the inflection point
of the ITC titration curve and so does ΔHvH derived from eq 7. The measured enthalpy ΔHITC,
on the other hand, is fitted by the starting points of an ITC isotherm
at low θ. ΔHITC may differ
at higher θ in cases where negative cooperativity comes into
play. Hence, eq 7 and
the estimates given in Table 2 can only work on a qualitative level.

Conclusions
We present a systematic thermodynamic study on complexation of
dPGS-G2 with lysozyme. In particular, we measured the dependence of
the binding constant on temperature and ionic strength. The dependence
on salt concentration clearly revealed counterion-release as the driving
force while the dependence on temperature demonstrated strong enthalpy–entropy
compensation. Together with the simulations on the dPGS–lysozyme
binding, the present thermodynamic analysis shows that the enthalpic
and the entropic contributions compensate each other over the entire
range of temperature to give a nearly constant free energy driven
solely by electrostatic factors. Hence, in case of the present hydrophilic
dendritic system, the driving force, namely counterion-release with
electrostatic attraction, is responsible for binding while all contributions
due to hydration cancel out in good approximation.

Experimental

Materials
The protein lysozyme from chicken egg-white
with molecular weight 14.3 kDa was purchased from Alfa Aesar (J60701)
and used directly. dPGS of second generation (dPGS-G2) was synthesized
according to the literature.25,50 The properties of dPGS-G2
are collected in Table 3. More details are given in our previous work.16,24

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry
Sodium phosphate dibasic
(10 mM; Na2HPO4) and 1.8 mM potassium phosphate
monobasic (KH2PO4) were dissolved into solution,
and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 at RT by adding 1 M NaOH. To prepare
buffers with different ionic strengths, additional NaCl was added
into the buffer individually.

ITC was used to evaluate the thermodynamics
of dPGS–protein binding. The measurements were performed by
a MicroCal VP-ITC instrument (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) with
a syringe volume of 280 μL and a cell volume of 1.43 mL. The
interaction was measured at six ionic strengths each with seven temperatures.
A solution of lysozyme was located in the syringe and titrated stepwise
into the cell filled with dPGS solution. The dilution heat was obtained
by titrating a lysozyme solution of the same concentration into pure
buffer. Figure 2 displays
typical examples of experimental ITC curves. At higher salt concentration,
the binding affinity became smaller and the sample concentration had
to be increased to obtain a sigmoidal isotherm.37,51 Our previous analysis showed that an increase of the sample concentration
did not change the resulting binding constant (see Table S1 of ref (16)). Table 4 gathers the sample concentrations used for
the respective concentration of salt.

a The sample concentrations
are the

The raw data were analyzed with
the Origin 7.0 (MicroCal) software,
and the SSIS model was used to fit the isotherm.37 The SSIS model assumes that all the binding sites are equivalent
and independent. The thermodynamic data here are compared with previous
ITC measurements at 310 K in a different buffer (MOPS).16

Molecular Dynamics Simulation
CG
simulations with implicit
water and explicit salt were performed as described in our previous
work.16,29 The simulation used the stochastic dynamics
integrator in GROMACS 4.5.4 software package.52 The CG model of dPGS-G2 dendrimer was established by us before and
used directly here.24 The CG model of Lysozyme
(PDB: 2LZT)
was constructed taking each amino acid residue as a single CG bead
maintained by a structure-based Go-model force field.53 At physiological pH, dPGS-G2 and lysozyme had net charge
of −24 e and +8 e, respectively.16 The binding between lysozyme and dPGS-G2 was
conducted at 293 and 310 K each with two salt concentrations of 25
mM and 150 mM. The PMF was obtained using steered Langevin dynamics52 with steering velocity vp= 0.2 nm/ns and harmonic force constant K = 2500 kJ mol–1 nm–2. All parameters
were the same as in our previous work.16
