Polymeric
coatings are commonly employed to alter surface properties. While
some coatings are designed to remain stable over a prolonged period,
in applications such as pharmaceuticals or fertilizers, the coating
is designed to erode and reveal or release the underlying material.
Self-immolative polymers (SIPs) undergo depolymerization following
the cleavage of stimuli-responsive end-caps from their termini, enabling
controlled depolymerization in the solid state and in solution. Poly(ethyl
glyoxylate) (PEtG) is a promising SIP because of its depolymerization
to benign products, but its amorphous structure and low glass-transition
temperature make it unsuitable alone for coating applications. This
study explored the blending of PEtG with polyesters including polycaprolactone
(PCL), poly(l-lactic acid), and poly(R-3-hydroxybutyrate).
Block copolymers of PEtG with PCL were also synthesized and studied.
It was found that the phase separation behavior and consequently the
thermal and mechanical properties of the materials could be tuned
according to the composition of the blend, while the stimuli-responsive
degradation of PEtG was retained in the blends. This work therefore
provides a framework for the application of PEtG-based coatings in
applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to agricultural products.

==== Body
Introduction
Coatings are used extensively
to impart specific surface properties to objects that differ from
those of the bulk material from which the object is composed. For
example, fluoropolymer coatings are applied to cookware to introduce
resistance to both water and oil,1 while
poly(vinyl chloride) is applied to automobiles to prevent corrosion.2 In these applications, it is desirable for the
coating to retain its integrity as long as possible to prolong the
lifetime of the underlying surface. However, in other applications,
degradable coatings are desired. For example, coatings are applied
to pharmaceutical tablets to protect them during storage, while allowing
them to dissolve and release the drug after ingestion.3 In addition, coated fertilizer pellets are used to provide
a slow release of the fertilizer in soil over weeks to months.4

In the case of degradable coatings, it
is desirable that their erosion can be controlled to occur under specific
conditions at a predetermined rate. This can be achieved with stimuli-responsive
polymers, which degrade or undergo changes in their physical properties
in response to a stimulus such as changes in pH.5 For example, Eudragit polymers have been used extensively
in solid oral dosage forms of pharmaceuticals.6 These polymers are poly(meth)acrylates with acidic or basic groups
that undergo changes in solubility as they move through the digestive
tract, thereby controlling the encapsulation and release of the underlying
molecules. In addition, reduction-sensitive disulfide linkages have
been used to cross-link polymer networks at the outlet of mesoporous
silica, blocking the release of encapsulated drugs.7 Cleavage of the disulfides by a reducing agent triggers
the release of the drugs.

One emerging class of stimuli-responsive
polymers is self-immolative polymers (SIPs).8−11 SIPs undergo end-to-end backbone
depolymerization upon the removal of stabilizing end-caps from the
polymer termini or cleavage of a bond in the backbone. Because the
degradation of an entire polymer chain is induced by a single bond
cleavage, SIPs effectively offer an amplification of the stimulus
event. In addition, because depolymerization is generally controlled
by the end-cap, a single SIP backbone can be engineered to respond
to many different stimuli. Some of the depolymerization stimuli that
have been investigated include enzymes,12 heat,13,14 light,15−17 ultrasound,18 and changes in pH19 or redox potential.17,19−22 Our group reported 6-nitroveratryl
carbonate end-capped poly(ethyl glyoxylate) (PEtG, Figure 1A)16 as a SIP with potential for a number of applications because of
its breakdown to nontoxic and environmentally benign products glyoxylic
acid hydrate and ethanol.23 We studied
the degradation of PEtG films as a function of pH, film thickness,
and water content, showing that PEtG offers well-controlled and tunable
degradation.24 However, on its own, PEtG
lacks suitable physical properties as a coating material because of
its amorphous structure and low glass-transition temperature (Tg) of −5 to −10 °C, making
it rubbery and tacky under ambient conditions.16,25

A strategy to overcome the limiting physical and mechanical
properties of polymers is the preparation of blends or copolymers
with other polymers.26 In this approach,
the resulting blend or copolymer can ideally assume the favorable
properties of both components. For example, in the area of SIPs, phthalaldehyde
and ethyl glyoxylate were copolymerized with the aim of tuning Tg and overcoming the brittleness of polyphthalaldehyde.25 However, to the best of our knowledge, physical
blends based on SIPs have not been reported. With the aim of developing
PEtG-based materials having properties suitable for coatings, we report
here the preparation and study of blends of PEtG with the well-established
biodegradable polymers PCL, PLA, and PHB (Figure 1B–D).27 Because macroscopic phase separation is a well-known challenge for
polymer blends, block copolymers of PEtG and PCL were also synthesized
and studied for comparison with the physical blends. The materials
were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and tensile
testing. The degradation of blend and copolymer films in response
to end-cap cleavage also was studied, showing that it was possible
to prepare materials with suitable coating properties while retaining
the desirable triggered depolymerization feature of SIPs.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
of PEtG–Polyester Blends
PEtG was synthesized as previously
reported16 by a low-temperature polymerization
of ethyl glyoxylate and was capped using 6-nitroveratryl chloroformate
to afford the corresponding carbonate end-capped polymer with an Mn value of 54 kg/mol and D̵ of 1.8 based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) relative to polystyrene standards. While various stimuli-responsive
end-caps have been incorporated onto PEtG, this UV-responsive polymer
serves as an ideal model system because the end-cap can be cleanly
and rapidly cleaved by irradiation with UV light (360 nm), thereby
triggering depolymerization (Figure 1A).16 The polyesters were
purchased from commercial sources. PCL was selected because it is
a biodegradable polyester that has been commonly blended with other
polymers to improve their properties, such as processing characteristics
and impact resistance.28 PCL has a low Tg value of about −60 °C but is semicrystalline
with a Tm value of ∼60 °C.
PLA was selected because it is a well-established biodegradable polymer
that can be obtained from renewable resources.29 It has a Tg value of 60–65
°C and a Tm value of 173–178
°C.30 Finally, PHB was also selected
because it is a bio-derived and biodegradable plastic. Its high melting
temperature (173–180 °C) and crystallinity of ∼80%
make it challenging to process, so it has commonly been combined with
PLA in a PLA/PHB 3:1 ratio to improve its physical properties.31 Thus, it also was employed as a 3:1 PLA/PHB
blend in this study. It was anticipated that the use of these three
different blend systems (PCL, PLA, and 3:1 PLA/PHB) would enable a
range of properties to be obtained for the blends with PEtG.

Blends were prepared by codissolving the PEtG and polyester in CH2Cl2 at ratios of 75:25, 50:50, and 75:25 polyester/PEtG
(90 mg/mL total polymer), drop-casting the solution as a film, and
then evaporating the solvent in vacuo at ambient temperature. Because
of the poor solubility of the semicrystalline PHB, it was first heated
just above the melting temperature (ca. 175 °C) and flash-cooled
in liquid N2 to provide an amorphous state. The amorphous
PHB was considerably more soluble, allowing for blend preparation.

Synthesis of a PEtG–PCL Block Copolymer
While polymer
blends can undergo macroscopic phase separation, the covalent linkages
between blocks confine phase separation to the nanoscale for block
copolymers, which can result in properties that are different from
those of blends.32 Thus, to compare the
blending to the block copolymer approach, a triblock copolymer PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL was targeted. First, UV-responsive
PEtG with alkyne functionality (Scheme 1A) was prepared as previously reported.16 The two different batches prepared for the current
work had Mn = 65 kg/mol and D̵ = 1.8 (alkyne-PEtG-65k) and Mn = 58
kg/mol and D̵ = 1.8 (alkyne-PEtG-58k). This
alkyne moiety has previously enabled the preparation of PEG-b-PEtG-b-PEG copolymers using copper-catalyzed
alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions with azide-terminated
PEG.16

Scheme 1 (A) Synthesis of PCL–PEtG Triblock
Copolymers and (B) Synthesis of Azide-Terminated PCL
Azide-terminated PCL (N3-PCL) was
then targeted with Mn values of 11 kg/mol
(N3-PCL-low) and 29 kg/mol (N3-PCL-high) to
give block copolymers with ∼25 and 50 wt % PCL after conjugation
to alkyne-PEtG-65k and alkyne-PEtG-58k, respectively. Bromide-terminated
PCL (Br-PCL) was first prepared using 3-bromo-1-propanol and trimethyl
aluminum as a catalyst for ring-opening polymerization in toluene
(Scheme 1B).33 SEC indicated an Mn value of 13.5 kg/mol and D̵ of 1.4 for Br-PCL-low
and an Mn value of 29.1 kg/mol and D̵ of 1.3 for Br-PCL-high (Figures S18 and S19).

Next, the bromide-terminated PCLs were
converted to N3-PCL-low and N3-PCL-high by reaction
with NaN3 in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 50 °C for
18 h. Conversion to N3-PCL was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy based on shifts in the peaks corresponding to
the methylene groups adjacent to the bromides versus azides (Figures S3 and S4). In addition, diagnostic azide
peaks (∼2100 cm–1) were observed in the Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the polymers (Figures S11 and S12). The block copolymers were synthesized
by CuAAC in THF at 50 °C using CuSO4 and sodium ascorbate
and with a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio of PCL/PEtG. Successful conjugation
of the blocks was confirmed by SEC analysis of the mixture before
and after the reaction S20 and S21. FTIR
spectroscopy also confirmed the disappearance of the peak corresponding
to the azide moieties (Figures S13 and S14). Analyses of the 1H NMR spectra also were consistent
with successful conjugations and confirmed that PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low and PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high had PCL content of ∼25 and 50 wt %, respectively
(Figures S5 and S6).

Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of the blends and copolymers were investigated
by TGA and DSC. On the basis of TGA, all blends and copolymers underwent
a two-phase degradation, with the PEtG degrading at ∼180 °C
and the polyesters degrading at ∼350 °C in the case of
PCL, ∼300 °C for PLA, and ∼275 °C for PHB
(Figures 2A and S22–S25). In addition, the percentage
degraded at the different temperatures corresponded to the expected
mass % of the respective polymers in the blends. DSC analyses confirmed
that phase separation occurred for each system, as there were distinct
thermal transitions for the individual polymers in the blends (Table 1, Figures 2B and S22–S25). For example, for the PCL/PEtG blends, Tg values for the PEtG were observed at −3
to −6 °C and the Tm value
for the crystalline PCL phase was observed at 53–55 °C.
As previously reported, multiple melting behavior of PCL was observed
for some of the samples and has been attributed to the melting of
thinner, followed by thicker sections of PCL lamellae.34 The Tg value of
the PEtG phase was slightly elevated with increasing PCL content relative
to that of the pure polymer, while at the same time, blending with
PEtG lowered the PCL Tm relative to that
of pure PCL, presumably due to decreasing crystal size. A similar
thermal behavior was observed for the copolymers PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL. The PCL Tg could not be detected in the blends because of the dominant transitions
associated with PEtG’s Tg and PCL’s Tm.

In the PLA/PEtG blends, a small
increase in the PEtG Tg to −6 to
−7 °C also was observed. At the same time, the Tg value of PLA decreased significantly, from
63 °C for the pure polymer to 48–54 °C for the blends,
suggesting partial mixing of the two polymers. Although a Tm value for PLA would be expected at 173–178
°C, the limited thermal stability of the PEtG prevented analysis
up to these temperatures, so it could not be measured. Only one Tg was observed for each of the PLA/PHB/PEtG
blends at −9 to −16 °C, which was lower than any
of the Tg values expected for the individual
polymers. However, the apparent lower Tg values may be related to the increased broadness of the transitions
for these blends35 and the consequent uncertainty
in defining the onset Tg. Tms were observed at 42–45 °C, and analysis
of the homopolymers suggested that this was due to small PHB crystalline
domains that resulted from the processing method. The presence of
a PLA Tg buried under the PHB Tm peak could not be excluded. Although preparation
and thermal analysis of the 75:25 polyester/PEtG blends was of interest
to elucidate trends in their thermal properties, further evaluation
detailed below focused on the 50:50 and 25:75 systems because they
would be more likely to exhibit the stimuli-responsive degradation
properties of PEtG, whereas higher ester content would lead to dominant
nonresponsive degradation properties of the polyester.

Atomic Force
Microscopy
Phase separation in the blends and the copolymers
also was examined by AFM.36 In this case,
films were prepared by spin-coating the polymer solutions onto glass
microscope slides. Phase contrast images are shown for the blends
and copolymers with PCL in Figure 3, while those of the PLA or PLA/PHB blends are shown
in Figure 4 and those
of the homopolymers are shown in Figure S26. Pure PEtG samples appeared smooth and featureless and were difficult
to measure using the tapping function of the atomic force microscope
because of their tackiness (Figure S26A). Each of the PCL/PEtG blends exhibited phase separation with domains
of semicrystalline PCL having dimensions of a few to tens of micrometers,
immersed in a PEtG matrix (Figure 3A,B). For PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low, nanophase separation was not clearly observed, but there
were clearly submicrometer-scale textures induced by the crystallinity
of the PCL (Figure 3C). PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high underwent
self-assembly to form lamellar structures having widths on the order
of ∼10 nm (Figure 3D).

Figure 3 Phase contrast AFM images of the PEtG blends and copolymer with
PCL: (A) PCL/PEtG 25:75 and (B) PCL/PEtG 50:50; (C) PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low; and (D) PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high. Micrometer-scale phase separation was observed
for the blends, whereas the copolymers exhibited submicrometer-scale
textures.

PLA and PHB. (A) PLA/PEtG 25:75 with domains of PLA surrounded by

of PHB observed in an amorphous matrix; and (D) PLA/PHB/PEtG 37.5:12.5:50
showing multiple phases corresponding to the different polymers.

In the 25:75 PLA/PEtG blends,
small (<2 μm diameter) domains presumed to be either glassy
or semicrystalline PLA in a matrix of PEtG were observed (Figure 4A). For the 50:50
blend, the AFM image suggested the presence of three phases, which
may be PEtG, glassy PLA, and crystalline PLA (Figure 4B), although the presence of crystalline
PLA domains could not be confirmed by DSC as noted above. Two phases
also were observed for pure PLA, confirming its semicrystalline structure
after spin-coating (Figure S26C). For the
19:6:75 PLA/PHB/PEtG blends, the AFM image suggested small (<2
μm diameter) crystallites of PHB immersed in a relatively homogeneous
matrix of PLA and PEtG (Figure 4C). On the other hand, the image of 37.5:12.5:50 PLA/PHB/PEtG
was dominated by two phases, likely corresponding to PLA and PEtG
(Figure 4D).

Mechanical
Testing
Tensile testing was performed to evaluate the effects
of blending and copolymer synthesis on the mechanical properties of
the polymers. The 25:75 polyester/PEtG blends could not be evaluated
because of their very poor structural integrities, so the testing
focused on comparing the pure polyesters to the 50:50 blends and to
the copolymer PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high.
The properties of the pure polyesters were similar to those previously
reported (Table 2, Figure S27).31,37 PCL, which
has a Tg value well below room temperature
but a Tm value above it, had a Young’s
modulus of 492 ± 25 MPa, an ultimate tensile strength of 13.4
± 0.7 MPa, and an elongation at break of 4.1 ± 0.3% (±used
to denote standard deviation). Both PLA and PLA/PHB 75:25 had higher
Young’s moduli of 1404 ± 139 and 1392 ± 133 MPa,
respectively, and higher ultimate tensile strengths of 25.5 ±
1.2 and 17.7 ± 0.5 MPa, respectively. They also were very brittle,
with strain at break values of 3.6 ± 0.5 and 2.3 ± 0.9%,
respectively. These properties can be attributed to PLA and PHB being
in glassy, semicrystalline states at ambient temperature.

that are different denote significant differences between samples
(Tukey’s tests, p < 0.05). Data presented
are the means of five measurements with standard deviations calculated
using the five measurements.

The Young’s moduli and ultimate tensile strength were significantly
lower for all of the 50:50 blends and for the copolymers compared
to the pure polyesters. In each case, the difference was a bit more
than 2-fold. These differences can be attributed to decreases in the
overall crystallinities of the polymers, as well as the introduction
of the rubbery domains of PEtG. Although PEtG has a modulus that is
too low to be measured by tensile testing, it is clear that the blends
and copolymer have properties intermediate between the polymers from
which they are composed. Comparing the PCL/PEtG blend to the copolymer
PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high, it was noted
that the blend had a Young’s modulus of 192 ± 15 MPa,
whereas the copolymer had a modulus of only 80 ± 19 MPa. The
blend and copolymer had statistically indistinguishable ultimate tensile
strengths of 4.9 ± 0.5 and 5.4 ± 0.5 MPa, respectively.
However, the strain at break (41.10 ± 34.1%) was much larger
for the copolymer compared to only 4.0 ± 0.5% for the blend.
These differences can be attributed to the different effects of micrometer-scale
versus nanometer-scale phase separation and the effects of smaller
versus larger crystalline PCL domains. Of the blends, the 50:50 PLA/PEtG
system had the highest Young’s modulus of 660 ± 70 MPa
and the highest ultimate tensile strength of 12.0 ± 1.4 MPa,
while retaining a similar elongation at break to the other blends.
This result suggests that this blend would form the most robust coatings.

Film Degradation
To determine how the degradation properties
of the films were affected by blending and copolymer synthesis, films
were prepared by drop-casting polymer solutions (∼80 μm
thick) on the bottoms of glass vials and then mass loss was measured
following immersion in pH 7.4 buffer at ambient temperature (22 °C).
The triggered samples were subjected to irradiation with a mercury
lamp (2.8 mW/cm2 in the UVA range) for 240 min at t = 0, 10, and 20 days. Because the films were not optically
transparent, the latter irradiations were designed to expose the underlying
layers of PEtG to the stimulus. Untriggered control samples were stored
in the dark. At each time point, irradiated and control samples (n = 3) were removed from the buffer, rinsed with distilled
water, dried in vacuo for 24 h, and weighed.

Mass loss began
rapidly for all of the irradiated films containing PEtG (Figure 5A,C,E). For the 25:75
polyester/PEtG blends, degradation continued over ∼25 days,
reaching a plateau at ∼40% residual mass (Figure 5A). Assuming that the polyester
component would not degrade significantly over the course of the trial,
the residual mass could be expected to reach 25%. However, some PEtG
may remain trapped within polyester domains, preventing either its
end-cap cleavage or erosion. Comparing the blends to the copolymer,
the initial degradation was faster for the blends, likely due to large
surface-accessible PEtG domains that could be rapidly eroded. In contrast,
PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low exhibited nanoscale
phase separation, and the requirement for degradation products to
diffuse out of the nanoscale domains may slow the process. However,
over the 30 days, a lower residual mass of 29 ± 2% was achieved,
compared with 35 ± 5 to 46 ± 3% for the blends, suggesting
that the PEtG domains are ultimately more accessible within the copolymer
film. The 50:50 polyester/PEtG blend films exhibited similar trends
to the 25:75 blends, except that the residual mass loss plateaued
at ∼60 wt %, consistent with the higher polyester content in
these blends (Figure 5C). The copolymer PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high
also underwent a slower, more linear decrease in mass loss, reaching
69 ± 1% after 30 days. Presumably the PEtG domains would have
completely eroded had the experiment been conducted over a longer
time frame.

(B,D,F) films immersed in 0.1 M pH 7.4 buffer at 22 °C: (A,B)

deviation.

Irradiated pure PEtG films eroded
to 5.5 ± 4.8% residual mass in 30 days, consistent with our previous
results,24 while pure polyesters of PCL,
PLA, and 3:1 PLA/PHB underwent <5% mass loss over 60 days (Figure 5E). The untriggered
control films all remained stable for ∼30 days and then began
to rapidly erode. Water can cleave either the carbonate linkage between
the polymer and the end-cap or it can hydrolyze pendant esters, resulting
in carboxylic acids that can intramolecularly catalyze the cleavage
of the polyacetal backbone. In either case, a single cleavage event
can initiate depolymerization, explaining why erosion progresses rapidly
once it begins. Nevertheless, the untriggered films were clearly much
more stable than the triggered films, showing that the stimuli-responsive
properties of PEtG were retained in both the blends and the copolymers.

The surface morphologies of the triggered and untriggered films
were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Representative
images for the 25:75 polyester/PEtG blends and PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low are shown in Figure 6 (triggered) and 7 (untriggered), while those
of the 50:50 blends, PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high, and the pure polymers are included in the Supporting Information (Figures S28 and S29).
Prior to irradiation and immersion in the buffer, the 25:75 polyester/PEtG
films were smooth and flat with minimal morphological differences
(Figure 6A,D,G,J).
After 15 days post-irradiation, large micrometer-scale pores were
revealed because of the erosion of PEtG domains from the blends (Figure 6B,E,H), while the
pores arising from degradation of PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low were nanometer sized (Figure 6I), consistent with the scales of phase separation
for these different polymer systems, as observed by AFM. The films
were even more porous at 30 days (Figure 6C,F,I,L). Nonirradiated blend and copolymer
films remained smooth and flat at 15 days (Figure 7A,C,E,G) but became porous after 45 days
(Figure 7B,D,F,H),
consistent with the results of the mass loss studies. Similar results
were observed for the 50:50 polyester/PEtG blends, PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-high, and the pure polymers, whereas
only PEtG underwent detectable degradation over 45 days (Figures S28 and S29).

Conclusions
This work demonstrated that it was possible
to tune the properties of PEtG by blending it with PCL, PLA, or 3:1
PLA/PHB and by preparing copolymers with PCL. TGA confirmed the compositions
of the blends and showed that they underwent a two-phase degradation
process. DSC and AFM showed that phase separation occurred for all
of the blends and copolymers, with Tg and Tm of each component only changing to a small
extent in comparison to the corresponding pure polymers. While micrometer-scale
phase separation occurred for the blends, it was possible to achieve
nanoscale phase separation for the block copolymers. While the polyester/PEtG
25:75 systems had very poor structural integrity because of their
high content of PEtG, tensile testing showed that the 50:50 blends
had a ∼2-fold reduction in Young’s modulus and ultimate
tensile strength relative to those of the corresponding pure polyester
systems with the elongation at break ranging from 3.6 to 6.0%. The
properties of the copolymer were also significantly different than
those of the blends, showing that covalent conjugation of the blocks
and the consequent nanoscale phase separation can have a significant
impact on the properties of the materials. Mass loss and SEM imaging
studies of triggered polymers showed that PEtG retained its degradation
properties when incorporated into the blends and copolymers, with
the blends leading to faster initial degradation but a higher residual
mass than the copolymers because of their different morphologies.
Overall, these data show that it is possible to tune the properties
of films based on the PEtG content, choice of polyester system, and
choice of blend versus block copolymer while still retaining the triggered
degradation of the PEtG. Future work will explore the application
of these materials as coatings for controlled release. In this context,
it will be important to investigate if and at which stage in the degradation
process the release of molecules through the residual porous matrix
of polyester can occur.

Experimental Section
General Materials and Procedures
PEtG with a 6-nitroveratryl carbonate end-cap and alkyne-PEtG were
synthesized as previously reported.16 PCL
(Mn = 55 kg/mol) was supplied by Scientific
Polymer Products, PLA (Mn = 103.5 kg/mol)
was purchased from 3D Solutech, and PHB (Mn = 550 kg/mol) was purchased from Goodfellow. CH2Cl2 was distilled from CaH2 immediately before use.
THF and toluene were distilled from sodium/benzophenone and degassed
by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles before use. DMF was
obtained from a solvent purification system using aluminum oxide columns.
NMR spectra were recorded on a 600 MHz Varian INOVA 600 instrument
or with a 400 MHz Bruker AVIII HD 400 instrument. 1H NMR
spectra were referenced to residual CHCl3 (7.27 ppm). FTIR
spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrum two instrument
in attenuated total reflectance mode. SEC was performed in THF at
5 mg/mL of the polymer using a Viscotek GPCmax VE 2001 SEC instrument
equipped with an Agilent PolyPore guard column (PL1113-1500) and two
sequential Agilent PolyPore SEC columns packed with porous poly(styrene-co-divinylbenzene) particles (MW range: 200–2 000 000
g/mol; PL1113-6500) regulated at a temperature of 30 °C. Molar
masses were calculated relative to polystyrene standards with a correction
factor of 0.56 applied to the PCL samples.38

Preparation of the polyester/PEtG Blends
PEtG, PCL, and
PLA were each dissolved in CH2Cl2 at a concentration
of 90 mg/mL. PHB was first converted to its highly amorphous state
by placing 1 g of PHB pellets within a piece of aluminum foil and
then placing this in a Carver 3851 Heated Press (Carver, Wabash, IN)
with both the plates set to 175 °C. Light pressure was applied
until the sample melted. The aluminum foil package was then submerged
in liquid nitrogen to flash-freeze the PHB. PLA and the amorphous
PHB were then dissolved in CH2Cl2 at a concentration
of 90 mg/mL total polymer in a 3:1 ratio. The stock solutions of the
polymer were then mixed to afford solutions containing 1:0, 75:25,
50:50, and 25:75 ratios of polyester/PEtG. Solution (0.33 mL) was
then drop-cast into a 25 mL glass vial and the solvent was evaporated
in vacuo until constant weight was achieved (∼48 h, ∼30
mg/vial). The average thickness of these films was ∼80 μm,
as measured by digital calipers, after removal from the vial.

Synthesis
of Br-PCL-Low
ε-Caprolactone (4.0 mL, 36 mmol), 3-bromo-1-propanol
(43 μL, 0.48 mmol), and dry toluene (24 mL) were combined in
a flame-dried round-bottom flask. Trimethylaluminum solution (2.0
M in toluene, 0.19 mL, 0.38 mmol) was then added and the solution
was heated at 50 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then quickly
cooled to room temperature and CH2Cl2 (10 mL)
and methanol (3 mL) were added. The reaction mixture was precipitated
into cold methanol (700 mL) and the product was isolated by filtration.
The polymer was then dissolved in minimal THF, precipitated into cold
methanol, and dried to constant weight under reduced pressure to afford
3.67 g (92% yield) of the product. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.33–1.42 (m, 2H), 1.58–1.68 (m,

Synthesis of Br-PCL-High
The same procedure as described
above for the synthesis of Br-PCL-low was followed except that ε-caprolactone
(4.65 mL, 42 mmol), 3-bromopropanol (22 μL, 0.24 mmol), and
trimethylaluminum solution (100 μL, 0.19 mmol) in toluene (36
mL) were used to afford 4.41 g (95% yield) of the product. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.33–1.42 (m, 2H),

Synthesis of N3-PCL-Low
Br-PCL-low (2.2 g, 0.20 mmol) was dissolved in DMF (45 mL) and heated to 50
°C. Sodium azide (0.6 g, 8.0 mmol, 40 equiv per Br) was then
added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 18 h, then
cooled to room temperature, and filtered. The filtrate was added to
150 mL of water. The mixture was extracted with CHCl3 (4
× 100 mL). The organic extracts were combined, washed with water
(100 mL), and concentrated. The polymer was then dissolved in minimal
CH2Cl2 and precipitated into hexanes, filtered,
and dried to constant weight under reduced pressure to afford 2.1
g (93% yield) of the product. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.33–1.42 (m, 2H), 1.58–1.68 (m,

2865, 2105, 1722, 1680 cm–1.

Synthesis of PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-Low
Alkyne-PEtG (Mn = 65 kg/mol, 1.0 g, 1.5 × 10–2 mmol) and N3-PCL-low (0.32 g, 2.9 × 10–2 mmol, 1.95 equiv) were dissolved in dry DMF (15 mL). CuSO4 (50 mg) and sodium ascorbate (50 mg) were then added. The reaction
mixture was degassed (3 × freeze–pump–thaw cycles)
and refilled with N2. The reaction mixture was then heated
to 40 °C for 16 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature.
It was filtered twice through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter and dried

(m, 1.0H). IR: 2990, 2945, 1745, 1725 cm–1. SEC: Mn = 59.0 kg/mol, D̵ =
2.0.

Synthesis of PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-High
The same procedure described above for the synthesis of PCL-b-PEtG-b-PCL-low was followed except that
alkyne-PEtG (Mn = 58 kg/mol, 1.5 g, 2.6
× 10–2 mmol), N3-PCL-high (1.5 g,
2.6 × 10–2 mmol), CuSO4 (50 mg),
and sodium ascorbate (50 mg) in THF (25 mL) were used to afford 2.5

cm–1. SEC: Mn = 62.1
kg/mol, D̵ = 2.1.

Thermal Analysis
Polymer blends were prepared by the abovementioned process. TGA was
performed using a TA Instruments (New Castle, DE) Q-50 TGA instrument.
Polymer (10 mg) was placed in an aluminum Tzero pan and heated at
a rate of 10 °C/min between 35 and 500 °C under nitrogen
purging. DSC was performed using a Q2000 instrument from TA instruments.
The heating/cooling rate was 10 °C/min from −75 to +120
°C. The onset Tg and Tm values were obtained from the second heating cycle.

Atomic Force Microscopy
Glass microscope slides were washed
with acetone. Polyester/PEtG solutions were diluted to 10 mg/mL and
then passed through a Promax 0.22 μm PTFE filter three times.
The filtered solution (20 μL) was then dropped onto the center
of a glass slide and placed in a WS-400-6NPP-LITE Spin Processor,
where it was exposed to a vacuum and rotated at 3000 rpm. AFM was
then performed using a Park Systems XE-100 instrument with a tip apex
radius of 10 nm. Surface topography and phase images were examined
using the AFM tapping mode. The data were analyzed using XEI image
processing software.

Tensile Testing
Polyester/PEtG solutions
(1:0 and 50:50, 100 mg/mL) in CHCl3 were prepared using
the same method as for the CH2Cl2 solutions
described above. The solution was then added to a polytetrafluoroethylene
mold (50 mm × 50 mm). The samples were then left to evaporate
for 18 h in a fume hood. The resulting films were cooled to −35
°C, removed from the block, and cut into 10 mm × 50 mm strips
(∼0.2 mm thickness as measured by digital calipers) for tensile
measurements. Tensile testing was performed using Instron 5943 (10
N load cell). The extension rate was 5 mm/min. At least five specimens
were tested for each blend.

Film Degradation Studies
The films
were prepared as described above (preparation of the polyester/PEtG
blends). Accurate initial masses of each film were measured and recorded.
Samples were irradiated subsequently by being placed into an ACE glass
photochemistry cabinet containing a mercury light source (450 W bulb,
2.8 mW/cm2 measured for UVA radiation at the sample position)
for 4 h to trigger the light-sensitive end-cap. The irradiation was
repeated at 10 and 20 days after initial exposure to ensure end-cap
cleavage of underlying layers. Controls samples were not irradiated
and were stored in the dark. All samples were submerged in 0.1 M pH
7.4 phosphate buffer solution at ambient temperature (22 °C).
At desired time points, the vials from each treatment were removed
from the buffer solution, rinsed with distilled water, and dried under
reduced pressure for 48 h. Their masses were then recorded and compared
to initial values to calculate the % initial mass remaining. Mass
loss for the irradiated blends was measured over a 30 day period,
while mass loss for control blends was measured over a 60 day period.
Triplicate samples were measured at each time point.

Scanning Electron
Microscopy
For irradiated samples, films from the degradation
study were removed from the vials for the 0, 15, and 30 day time points.
For nonirradiated control samples, films were removed from the vials
for the 15 and 45 day time points. The samples were mounted on carbon-taped
aluminum stubs and sputtered with gold at a rate of 5 nm/min for 4
min (Hummer-6 sputtering system, Anatech, Union City, California).
SEM was performed on a Hitachi S-3400N instrument at a voltage of
3 kV (Hitachi, Toyko, Japan).
