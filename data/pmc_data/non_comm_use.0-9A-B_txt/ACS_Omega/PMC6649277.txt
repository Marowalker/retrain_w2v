The
assembly of peptides and proteins into nanoscale amyloid fibrils
via formation of intermolecular β-sheets not only plays an important
role in the development of degenerative diseases but also represents
a promising approach for the synthesis of functional nanomaterials.
In many biological and technological settings, peptide assembly occurs
in the presence of organic and inorganic interfaces with different
physicochemical properties. In an attempt to dissect the relative
contributions of the different molecular interactions governing amyloid
assembly at interfaces, we here present a systematic study of the
effects of terminal modifications on the adsorption and assembly of
the human islet amyloid polypeptide fragment hIAPP(20–29) at
organic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) presenting different functional
groups (cationic, anionic, polar, or hydrophobic). Using a selection
of complementary in situ and ex situ analytical techniques, we find
that even this well-defined and comparatively simple model system
is governed by a rather complex interplay of electrostatic interactions,
hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding, resulting in a plethora
of observations and dependencies, some of which are rather counterintuitive.
In particular, our results demonstrate that terminal modifications
can have tremendous effects on peptide adsorption and assembly dynamics,
as well as aggregate morphology and molecular structure. The effects
exerted by the terminal modifications can furthermore be modulated
in nontrivial ways by the physicochemical properties of the SAM surface.
Therefore, terminal modifications are an important factor to consider
when conducting and comparing peptide adsorption and aggregation studies
and may represent an additional parameter for guiding the assembly
of peptide-based nanomaterials.

1 Introduction
Molecular
self-assembly plays an important role in biology and
is nowadays increasingly utilized in bionanotechnology.1 A prominent example encountered in both disciplines
is the assembly of proteins and peptides into nanoscale amyloid fibrils
via the formation of intermolecular β-sheets. Although such
fibrils may serve as nanoscale building blocks in the synthesis of
functional materials and devices,2−5 amyloid assembly and fibrillization are
also important steps in the development of so-called misfolding diseases
such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).6−8 Understanding and controlling
amyloid assembly at a molecular level thus represent essential milestones
along the route toward new functional materials and medical therapies.

Among the multitude of environmental parameters that are known
to affect amyloid assembly kinetics and morphology, such as monomer
concentration, temperature, pH, and ionic strength, the effects exerted
by organic and inorganic interfaces with varying physicochemical properties
on amyloidogenic peptides and proteins receive growing attention.9 This is to a large extent driven by the increasing
number of medical applications that employ therapeutic and diagnostic
nanoparticles that interact with numerous proteins and peptides in
the body and may thereby induce or inhibit their assembly into toxic
amyloid aggregates.10−13 On the other hand, amyloid fibrillization is increasingly explored
with regard to applications in surface functionalization14,20 and the synthesis of hybrid materials that incorporate amyloid-like
fibrils and other organic and inorganic materials.15−20 Consequently, amyloid assembly at interfaces has been the subject
of numerous studies.21−51 These works as a whole paint a fairly complex picture of the adsorption
and fibrillization of amyloidogenic peptides and proteins at interfaces,
which appear to be governed by the interplay and competition of several
inter- and intramolecular interactions, that is, hydrophobic interactions,
electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and sometimes even covalent
bonding, all of which may be significantly affected even by small
variations in the properties of the surface35 or the molecule.21 As a result of this
high degree of complexity, the adsorption and assembly behavior of
a given peptide or protein at a given surface is almost impossible
to predict and often counterintuitive.21

In an attempt to dissect the relative contributions of the
different
molecular interactions to amyloid assembly at interfaces, we here
present a systematic study of the effects of terminal modifications
on the adsorption and assembly of human islet amyloid polypeptide
hIAPP(20–29) at chemically defined surfaces, that is, organic
self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) presenting different functional groups.
Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is a 37-residue hormone secreted
by the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas, which may
assemble into cytotoxic oligomeric and fibrillar amyloid structures.52 In the course of T2DM, these amyloid structures
damage the membranes of the β-cells, resulting in long-term
β-cell failure.53 The hIAPP fragment
hIAPP(20–29) is able to form amyloid fibrils on its own, which
are known to show a pronounced polymorphism, both in bulk solution54 and at interfaces.22 Its native sequence (Figure 1) features five hydrophobic amino acids but no charged residues.
Under physiological conditions, its interaction with hydrophobic interfaces
will thus involve only the hydrophobic amino acid residues, whereas
electrostatic interactions with charged interfaces will be mediated
by the charged termini only. By acetylation and amidation of the N
and the C termini, respectively (see Figure 1), the relative contributions of attractive
and repulsive electrostatic interactions can be controlled.

Hydrophobic residues are indicated in red.

Several previous studies have addressed the effects of terminal
modifications on amyloid assembly for various peptides and proteins.45,55−63 In general, terminal modifications were found to affect fibrillization
propensity and kinetics, as well as the morphology, mechanical properties,
and molecular structures of the assembled fibrils. For instance, Andreasen
et al. investigated the assembly of hIAPP(20–29) with and without
terminal modifications in bulk solution.55 Whereas the native fragment formed flat fibrils, C-terminal amidation
induced the formation of twisted fibrils. N-terminal acetylation on
the other hand completely inhibited fibrillization. This was also
verified using infrared spectroscopy, which revealed a purely random
coil conformation of the acetylated fragment, whereas the other peptides
assumed conformations rich in β-sheets. Intriguingly, the acetylated
and amidated peptide formed fibrils similar to those of the native
peptide but at a much lower rate. Despite the significant interest
in the effects of terminal modifications on amyloid fibrillization,
only a few studies have so far evaluated its role in peptide adsorption
and surface-mediated assembly. Karsai et al. investigated the epitaxial
growth of Aβ(25–35) fibrils on mica surfaces.45 These fibrils were aligned along certain crystallographic
directions as a result of the specific interaction of positive charges
in the peptide with the negative charges of the mica surface. Acetylation
of the N terminus thus resulted in reduced crystallographic alignment.

In this work, we studied the interaction of different hIAPP(20–29)
fragments (see Figure 1) with NH3+-, COO–-, OH-,
and CH3-terminated SAMs in situ using quartz crystal microbalance
with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), which allowed us to assess differences
in adsorption kinetics and adsorbate film structure. Ex situ atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and polarization-modulated infrared reflection
absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) investigations provided us with
information regarding the morphology and molecular structure of the
amyloid assemblies formed at the different surfaces. The combination
of these complementary, surface-sensitive techniques allows for a
thorough investigation of molecular processes involved in peptide
adsorption and surface-mediated assembly.21 Using this experimental approach, we find that even this well-defined
and comparatively simple model system is governed by a rather complex
interplay of electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions,
and hydrogen bonding with terminal modifications affecting peptide
adsorption and assembly dynamics, aggregate morphology, and molecular
structure. These termini-specific effects can furthermore be modulated
in nontrivial ways by the physicochemical properties of the SAM surface.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Bulk Solution
To assess any intrinsic
effects of the terminal modifications on hIAPP(20–29) assembly,
we first investigated amyloid formation for all fragments in bulk
solution using Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor
β-sheet formation.64,65 As can be seen in Figure S1, no increase in ThT fluorescence intensity
is observed for the four fragments over 24 h of incubation. This is
at variance with the results obtained by Andreasen et al., who observed
strong hIAPP(20–29) fibrillization over similar time scales
with terminal modifications having a strong effect on aggregation
propensity and kinetics.55 This discrepancy
can be attributed to the different buffer conditions used and especially
the significantly higher monomer concentrations employed in the study
of Andreasen et al. Despite the absence of increased ThT fluorescence,
the AFM images in Figures 2a and S2 show prefibrillar aggregates
with some differences in aggregate morphology between the different
fragments. For the fragments with amidated C termini (+|0) and (0|0),
rather homogeneous particles with similar sizes are observed. Because
of their rather homogeneous sizes and almost spherical shapes, we
believe that these particle-like aggregates represent amyloid oligomers.
For the acetylated fragment (0|-), smaller particle-like aggregates
seem to dominate, whereas additional large, irregularly shaped aggregates
can sometimes be observed as well. The aggregates of the native fragment
(+|-) are not as homogeneous in size and shape and may thus include
also amorphous aggregates. The molecular structure of the aggregates
was assessed by PM-IRRAS, which allowed us to quantify their β-sheet
contents (see the Supporting Information (SI)).21 In contrast to the ThT fluorescence
data in Figure S1, which do not show any
β-sheet-specific increase in fluorescence, PM-IRRAS reveals
significant β-sheet contents for all fragments (Figures S10 and 2b). This
discrepancy may be attributed to the limited sensitivity of the ThT
assay, which may not detect all oligomeric species.66 The PM-IRRAS results in Figure 2b further reveal some significant differences
between the fragments. Whereas the fragments with native C termini
(+|-) and (0|-) have virtually identical β-sheet contents of
∼33%, the acetylated and amidated fragment (0|0) has a slightly
higher content of 39%. For the amidated fragment with native N terminus
(+|0), however, the total β-sheet content is decreased to about
24%. These results are again at variance with the report by Andreasen
et al., who observed that acetylation completely abolished any hIAPP(20–29)
aggregation and resulted only in random coil conformations.55 This can again be attributed to the different
buffer conditions and especially the different ionic strengths. At
the comparatively high ionic strength of the phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) buffer used in our experiments, stronger screening of electrostatic
interactions may result in a weaker influence of the terminal charges
on peptide assembly, which thus may be less sensitive to terminal
modification. Furthermore, the two fragments with amidated C termini
(+|0) and (0|0) show comparatively high contents of antiparallel β-sheets
around 10%, whereas the native (+|-) and acetylated (0|-) fragments
feature only about 4 and 1% of antiparallel β-sheets, respectively.
High content of antiparallel β-sheets may thus be related to
the larger, homogeneous particle-like aggregates in Figure 2a, which are not as dominant
for the native (+|-) and acetylated (0|-) fragments. Whereas previous
NMR investigations have demonstrated the possibility of acetylated
and amidated hIAPP(20–29) to form two molecularly different
fibrillary species with either parallel or antiparallel β-sheets,67 our results indicate that this structural polymorphism
may be modulated by terminal modifications of hIAPP(20–29).
These investigations thus show that terminal modifications may result
in pronounced differences in the molecular structures of prefibrillar
oligomeric aggregates.

2.2 Positively Charged NH2-Terminated
SAM
Under physiological conditions, that is, pH 7.5, the
terminal groups of the NH2 SAM will be protonated and thus
positively charged. Consequently, adsorption of hIAPP(20–29)
should be governed by the interplay of electrostatic attraction and
repulsion between the surface and the C and N termini of the peptide,
respectively. This has been assessed in situ over the course of several
hours using QCM-D. The shift of the resonance frequency ΔF shown in Figure 3 is a measure of the peptide mass adsorbed on the SAM-modified
electrode surface.68 As can be seen in Figure 3, ΔF is decreasing for all fragments upon injection of the
peptide-containing buffer at t = t0. However, for the native (+|-) and acetylated (0|-)
fragments, adsorption proceeds for more than 12 h without any sign
of saturation. The two amidated fragments (+|0) and (0|0) on the other
hand quickly reach a plateau in which no significant adsorption is
observed anymore. Flushing the QCM-D cells with peptide-free PBS buffer
at t = t1 results in
the desorption of reversibly adsorbed species. Similar amounts of
desorption are observed for all fragments. The change in dissipation
ΔD is also plotted in Figure 3 for all four fragments and mirrors
the trends found in the ΔF plots. The fragments
with native C termini (+|-) and (0|-) show a stronger increase in
ΔD upon adsorption than the fragments with
amidated C termini (+|0) and (0|0), indicating the formation of adsorbate
films with higher viscoelasticity. Despite these pronounced differences
in adsorption behavior, no significant variations can be deduced from
the AFM images in Figure S7, which are
dominated by the comparatively rough topography of the polycrystalline
gold electrode surface.

Figure 3 QCM-D results (ΔF, upper
row; and ΔD, lower row) of the interaction
of the different hIAPP
fragments with the different SAMs. The arrows in the left column exemplarily
indicate the times t0 and t1 of peptide injection and flushing with buffer, respectively.

These observations are in line
with our hypothesis that hIAPP(20–29)
adsorption at the positively charged NH2-terminated SAM
is to a large extent governed by electrostatic interactions. The fragments
with native, negatively charged C termini show the strongest frequency
shifts, whereas the fragments with amidated C termini that lack any
negative charge adsorb only weakly. Based on these observations, one
could assume that the (+|-) and (0|-) monomers adsorb in an upright
conformation with their C termini electrostatically bound to the NH3+ groups of the SAM and their N-terminal regions
dangling from the surface. The weak adsorption of the amidated fragments
(0|-) and (0|0) in the absence of any electrostatic attraction, however,
is most likely the result of hydrogen bond formation between the NH3+ groups of the SAM and the peptides’ backbone
and amino acid residues.

To assess the molecular structure of
the adsorbate films, we have
again turned to PM-IRRAS and first quantified the amount of adsorbed
peptide on the NH2-terminated SAM after the QCM-D experiments
by integrating the amide I intensities (see SI). The results are shown in Figure 4 and compared to the corresponding ΔF values obtained from the QCM-D measurements. Surprisingly, this
comparison reveals a significant deviation from the overall trend
observed in the QCM-D measurements. In fair agreement with the
ΔF data, the native fragment (+|-) shows the
highest amide I intensity and the two amidated fragments (+|0) and
(0|0) show the lowest, almost identical amide I intensities. For the
acetylated fragment (0|-), however, an integrated amide I intensity
close to those of the amidated fragments is obtained, whereas the
corresponding ΔF value is close to that of
the native fragment. It is well known that the adsorbed mass measured
by QCM-D includes not only the adsorbed peptide but also water molecules
trapped in or hydrodynamically coupled to the adsorbate film. In fact,
the contribution of coupled water can easily overcome that of the
adsorbed peptide or protein.69,70 Therefore, the observed
discrepancies may indicate different amounts of trapped or coupled
water for the different fragment films.

Figure 4 Integrated amide I intensities
of the different hIAPP(20–29)
adsorbate films at the different SAMs as determined by PM-IRRAS (see SI). The black squares give the corresponding
−ΔF values (right axis) obtained from
the QCM-D measurements (Tables 1–4).

To investigate this effect in more detail, we have calculated
the
loss factor −ΔD/ΔF at the end of the QCM-D experiment (see Table 1), which is a mass-independent measure of the dissipation.21,69−71 As can be seen from the corresponding values in Table 1, a decrease in the
loss factor from 0.29 to 0.17 × 10–6 Hz–1 is observed upon acetylation of the native fragment.
Acetylated hIAPP(20–29) monomers thus dissipate less energy
than native ones, which indicates that native and acetylated monomers
adopt different conformations upon adsorption. In particular, the
high loss factor of the native fragment (+|-) indicates a rather loosely
attached adsorbate film in which the monomers adopt an upright conformation
and dangle from the surface. In contrast, the lower loss factor of
the acetylated fragment (0|-) indicates a more firmly attached adsorbate
film with the peptide monomers forming multiple contacts with the
SAM surface, presumably via hydrogen bonding. The reason for this
rather drastic change in conformation may be the reduction of electrostatic
repulsion between the N terminus and the NH2-terminated
SAM upon acetylation. Due to this conformation, the acetylated peptide
film seems to trap large amounts of water. Although the amidated fragments
(+|0) and (0|0) show a similar, albeit less pronounced reduction in
loss factor upon acetylation, trapped water does not play such a significant
role. This indicates significantly different adsorbate film structures.

–ΔD/ΔF (10–6 Hz–1)	0.29	0.17	0.27	0.20	
a The values were obtained at the
end of the QCM-D measurements, that is, after flushing with peptide-free
buffer.

The β-sheet
contents of the adsorbate films were again determined
by deconvolution of the amide I bands (see SI), the results of which are given in Figure 5. As can be seen, the determined β-sheet
content does not seem to correlate in any way with the adsorbed mass.
Comparison with the β-sheet contents determined after assembly
in bulk solution (black dots in Figure 5), however, reveals a rather different trend. With
the exception of the acetylated fragment (0|-), which has an almost
identical total β-sheet content in bulk and at the NH2 SAM, the β-sheet contents of all the other fragments increase
significantly. The strongest increase of more than 30% is observed
for the native fragment (+|-) and the smallest for the amidated (+|0)
fragment (+14%). In addition, formation of antiparallel β-sheets
seems to be reduced or fully suppressed at the NH2 SAM
for all fragments. These results thus demonstrate that terminal modifications
affect not only the adsorption of hIAPP(20–29) but also its
propensity to form intermolecular β-sheets, as well as the structural
arrangement of the corresponding β-strands. In particular, Figure 5 reveals that the
positively charged NH2 SAM may promote or retard the
formation of parallel and antiparallel β-sheets in hIAPP(20–29),
depending on the terminal modifications.

films at the different SAMs as determined by PM-IRRAS (see SI). The black dots give the corresponding total
β-sheet contents (parallel + antiparallel) observed in bulk
solution (Figure 2b).

2.3 Negatively
Charged COOH-Terminated SAM
For the COOH-terminated SAM,
whose terminal groups are deprotonated
and thus negatively charged at physiological pH, we basically expected
an inverted behavior compared to the positively charged NH2-terminated SAM. In particular, electrostatics-driven adsorption
should result in strong adsorption of the fragments with native and
thus positively charged N termini, whereas acetylation of the peptides
should lead to only weak adsorption. Surprisingly, however, this assumption
is not consistent with the results of the QCM-D measurements shown
in Figure 3 and Table 2.

Table 2 ΔF, ΔD, and −ΔD/ΔF Values of the Different hIAPP(20–29)
Fragments
Adsorbed on the Negatively Charged COOH-Terminated SAMa
 	(+|-)	(0|-)	(+|0)	(0|0)	
ΔF (Hz)	–47.95	–13.44	–2.28	–48.52	
ΔD (10–6)	12.15	3.92	1.78	14.49	
–ΔD/ΔF (10–6 Hz–1)	0.25	0.29	0.78	0.30	
a The values were obtained at the
end of the QCM-D measurements, that is, after flushing with peptide-free
buffer.

As can be seen in Figure 3, large frequency
shifts of very similar magnitude are observed
for the fragments (+|-) and (0|0) with zero net charge, whereas the
positively charged fragment (+|0) shows almost no adsorption at all
at the negatively charged SAM. Intermediate adsorption is observed
for the negatively charged fragment (0|-) despite the presence of
electrostatic repulsion. In our previous work, we have observed that
such electrostatic repulsion can be overcome by hydrogen bond formation
between peptide and SAM, which may lead to significant adsorption.21 Therefore, we assume that hydrogen bonding plays
a dominant role also in the adsorption of the acetylated peptide (0|-)
to the COOH-terminated SAM. Nevertheless, in the case of the native
fragment (+|-), adsorption appears rather likely to involve the positively
charged N-terminal region. This is in part because of the electrostatic
repulsion between the terminal COO– groups of the SAM
and the negatively charged C terminus, which should favor an upright
conformation of the peptide similar to the case of the NH2-terminated SAM discussed above. Furthermore, it was previously observed
that purely electrostatic adsorption of native hIAPP(20–29)
at a negatively charged mica surface results first in the adsorption
of monomers in an upright conformation that is stabilized by intermolecular
β-sheets and finally in enhanced fibrillization.22 This is also observed in the AFM images shown
in Figure S8, where few short protofibrils
are visible for the native fragment (+|-).

The reduced yet significant
adsorption of the acetylated fragment
(0|-) is indicative of adsorption via hydrogen bonding. Considering
the remaining negative charge at the C terminus of (0|-), it appears
likely that this hydrogen bonding interaction involves mainly the
N-terminal region, whereas the C-terminal region is to some extent
dangling from the surface. This is consistent with the obtained loss
factor (see Table 2), which is similar to the one obtained for the native fragment (+|-)
and thus indicates a somewhat upright and dangling conformation. Removing
also the negative charge of the C terminus via additional amidation
should then result in reduced electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed
peptide monomers and the SAM, as well as between neighboring monomers,
and thus increase adsorption. This is observed for the uncharged fragment
(0|0), which shows a similar frequency shift as the native one (+|-).
However, the obtained loss factor is virtually identical to the one
of the acetylated fragment (0|-) and thus indicates that the monomers
still assume an upright conformation.

Even harder to explain
is the low adsorption of the amidated fragment
(+|0) (see Figure 3 and Table 2). Amidation
of the negatively charged C terminus should result in decreased electrostatic
repulsion both between neighboring monomers and between monomers and
the negatively charged surface. Thus, we would expect to observe a
stronger decrease in the resonance frequency compared to the native
fragment, as well as a lower loss factor. However, this is obviously
not happening here. On the contrary, as is evident from Figure 3 and Table 2, the amidated fragment (+|0) shows only
very low adsorption at the COOH-terminated SAM and, even more astonishingly,
a very high loss factor of 0.78 × 10–6 Hz–1.

To evaluate the role of bound water in the
above QCM-D measurements,
the obtained frequency shifts listed in Table 2 are again compared to the integral amide
I intensities determined by PM-IRRAS in Figure 4. As in the case of the NH2 SAM,
a significant discrepancy in the overall trend is observed. Whereas
QCM-D yields similarly large frequency shifts for the native
(+|-) and the acetylated and amidated (0|0) fragment, the native peptide
actually exhibits the lowest amide I intensity. This is not too surprising,
considering that the native fragment (+|-) is the only fragment that
forms larger aggregates and even protofibrils at the COOH SAM (see Figure S8). It appears rather plausible that
such large aggregates may trap larger amounts of water molecules in
some buried cavities. Furthermore, the assembled protofibrils may
to a certain extent dangle from the surface, resulting in an increased
amount of hydrodynamically coupled water due to viscous drag.

The fact that both fragments (+|-) and (+|0) with native, positively
charged N termini show similarly low adsorption on the negatively
charged COOH-terminated SAM provides a clear indication that electrostatic
interactions do not play a significant role in this particular system.
At the same time, low monomer adsorption and high lateral mobility
are generally considered a prerequisite for amyloid assembly at solid–liquid
interfaces.21,22,24,72,73 This is evident
from Figure S8, which shows large prefibrillar
aggregates and a few protofibrils for native hIAPP(20–29).
PM-IRRAS (Figure 5)
reveals significantly increased β-sheet contents for all fragments
compared to the assembly in bulk solution (Figure 2b). In contrast to the case of the NH2 SAM discussed above, the strongest, almost threefold increase
in total β-sheet content is observed for the amidated fragment
(+|0), followed by the native fragment (+|-), which shows a similar
increase as for the NH2 SAM. Formation of antiparallel
β-sheets is again largely suppressed for all fragments at the
COOH SAM. These results indicate that the often observed effect that
negatively charged interfaces promote hIAPP amyloid formation21,22,74−76 may depend
on certain molecular features of the actual peptide in question.

2.4 Polar OH-Terminated SAM
The QCM-D
results and AFM images obtained for the interaction of the different
hIAPP(20–29) fragments with the polar OH-terminated SAM are
shown in Figures 3 and S9, respectively. For the two acetylated fragments
(0|-) and (0|0), similar large frequency shifts are observed, whereas
the native fragment (+|-) shows a lower yet significant shift. The
amidated fragment (+|0), however, does not show any irreversible adsorption.
Similar trends are observed in the change of dissipation ΔD. No aggregate structures can be resolved on the rough
gold electrode surfaces by AFM (Figure S9).

These results thus indicate that adsorption of the native
fragment (+|-) involves the negatively charged C terminus, amidation
of which suppresses adsorption. Acetylation of the positively charged
N terminus on the other hand results in a change of the adsorption
mode, which becomes considerably stronger and now involves the acetylated
N terminus. This rather specific interaction with the acetylated N
terminus is also reflected in the comparatively large loss factor
of 0.29 obtained for the acetylated peptide (0|-) in Table 3, which is consistent with an
upright monomer conformation. Additional amidation of the negatively
charged C terminus results in further increased frequency shift and
loss factor, which may be related to the reduced electrostatic repulsion
between adsorbed (0|0) monomers or the fact that adsorption of the
acetylated peptide (0|-) may involve both termini and thus cause a
monomer conformation that is not dangling but rather looping from
the surface. Most astonishing, however, is the observation that the
native fragment (+|-) does not show any significant shift in dissipation,
which results in a loss factor close to zero (see Table 3). This could indicate a very
rigid adsorbate film, which, however, is at variance with the above
interpretation of adsorption involving predominantly the native C
terminus.

–ΔD/ΔF (10–6 Hz–1)	0.03	0.29	 	0.37	
a The values
were obtained at the
end of the QCM-D measurements, that is, after flushing with peptide-free
buffer.

To shed some light
on this issue, we again compare the observed
frequency shifts to the integrated amide I intensities determined
from PM-IRRA spectra in Figure 4. Here, two remarkable features can be observed. First, the
integrated amide I intensity for the native peptide is close to zero.
This might be attributed again to the dominant influence of bound
and coupled water. In general, the wet mass of a given film of adsorbed
proteins can exceed its dry mass by more than an order of magnitude.70,71,77 However, in this particular case,
such a strong effect of coupled water is rather surprising, considering
the loss factor that is virtually zero and thus indicates a very rigid
adsorbate film that does not dissipate much energy. Similarly confusing
is the observation that the adsorbate film of the amidated fragment
(+|0) exhibits a significant amide I intensity despite QCM-D yielding
a frequency shift of essentially zero. At this moment, we can only
speculate that these discrepancies may result from a particular limitation
of the PM-IRRAS technique. In PM-IRRAS, only bonds contribute to the
recorded spectra that have a transition dipole moment with a component
oriented perpendicular to the surface.78 Therefore, one could imagine that the monomers in a thin adsorbate
film may adopt peculiar conformations upon drying that result in either
an over- or an underestimation of the adsorbed mass determined by
PM-IRRAS.

Nevertheless, we have attempted to determine the β-sheet
contents also of these adsorbate films (see SI). As can be seen in Figure 5, the strongest deviation from assembly in the bulk solution
is observed for the acetylated fragment (0|-), which shows a 30% increase
in the total β-sheet content. Furthermore, the amidated fragment
(+|0) is found to have a very low β-sheet content, <10%.
This is most likely related to the almost absent adsorption of this
peptide observed by QCM-D, which prevents assembly of the few adsorbed
monomers. Furthermore, at the polar OH SAM, formation of antiparallel
β-sheets seems completely suppressed in all fragments.

2.5 Hydrophobic CH3-Terminated SAM
The QCM-D
results of hIAPP(20–29) adsorption to the hydrophobic
CH3-terminated SAM are presented in Figure 3 and Table 4. The native (+|-), acetylated (0|-), and amidated
(+|0) fragments show almost identical behaviors with intermediate
frequency shifts around −10 Hz and only minor changes in dissipation.
For the acetylated and amidated fragment (0|0), however, significantly
higher ΔF values are observed throughout the
experiment. Interestingly, the (0|0) fragment also shows the highest
loss factor (see Table 4). Whereas adsorption of the other peptides results in very low loss
factors between 0.04 and 0.11, indicating very rigid adsorbate films,
the acetylated and amidated fragment (0|0) has a loss factor of 0.2.
The reason for this large difference is revealed in the AFM images
shown in Figure 6.
All four fragments form large fibrillar structures at the CH3 SAM. However, whereas the native (+|-), acetylated (0|-), and amidated
(+|0) fragments assemble into few, well-separated ribbonlike or straight
fibrils, large clusters of crossing fibrils are observed for the acetylated
and amidated peptide (0|0). Such clustering of fibrils may result
in an increased loss factor.21

a The values were obtained at the
end of the QCM-D measurements, that is, after flushing with peptide-free
buffer.

The assembly of
hIAPP(20–29) into mature fibrils at the
hydrophobic CH3 SAM is a rather surprising observation.
In our previous study, we have observed that fibrillization of native
hIAPP(20–29) is delayed in contact with a hydrophobic hydrocarbon
surface, whereas adsorption to a negatively charged mica surface resulted
in strongly enhanced fibrillization compared to assembly in bulk solution.22 However, these experiments were performed at
room temperature in water and not in PBS at 37 °C as the current
experiments. Since amyloid assembly in general and aggregate polymorphism
in particular are highly sensitive toward environmental conditions,79 these experimental differences may provide an
explanation for these unexpected results.

Figure 4 shows the
integrated amide I intensities of the adsorbed fragment films, together
with the frequency shifts obtained at the end of the QCM-D experiments.
Again, different trends are observed. Whereas QCM-D shows rather similar
ΔF values for the (+|-), (0|-), and (+|0) fragments,
PM-IRRAS yields very different amide I intensities, with the native
(+|-) and amidated (+|0) fragments having the lowest and highest integrated
intensity values, respectively. The acetylated fragments (0|-) and
(0|0) have rather similar, intermediate amide I intensities. These
discrepancies are most likely resulting from the formation of amyloid
fibrils whose size, morphology, and density affect the amount of hydrodynamically
coupled water.

To evaluate possible differences in the molecular
structures of
the formed hIAPP fibrils, the relative β-sheet contents have
again been determined from deconvolution of the amide I bands (Figure 5). As in the above
experiments at the OH-terminated SAM, contributions from antiparallel
β-sheets are essentially absent for all four fragments. Interestingly,
for the native fragment (+|-), the total β-sheet content shown
in Figure 5 is almost
identical to that obtained in the bulk experiments (parallel + antiparallel;
see Figure 2b) despite
the formation of amyloid fibrils. For the other three fragments, however,
significant increases in β-sheet content of 20–30% are
observed. This indicates that fibrillization of these fragment requires
certain molecular conformations that are not present in the prefibrillar
aggregates forming in bulk solution (see Figure 2).

According to the AFM images shown
in Figure 6, all terminally
modified fragments assemble
into straight fibrils at the CH3 SAM, whereas the native
fragment (+|-) forms sheetlike fibrils. Comparison with Figure 5 suggests that this fibrillary
polymorphism is correlated with different β-sheet contents since
all terminally modified fragments have significantly increased β-sheet
contents between 50 and 60%, whereas the native fragment (+|-) has
a β-sheet content similar to the bulk value of only about 35%.

The above observations of terminal modifications resulting in differences
in adsorption, fibril morphology, and molecular structure are particularly
remarkable considering that the interaction of hIAPP(20–29)
with the hydrophobic CH3-terminated SAM should involve
only the hydrophobic amino acid residues (see Figure 1) and thus be independent of the termini.
However, it was shown for a variety of short peptides that terminal
modifications may result in pronounced conformational changes in the
monomers.80−82 Such conformational alterations could not only be
responsible for the different aggregate morphologies and molecular
structures observed in bulk solution (see Figure 2), but also result in different interactions
with the CH3 SAM, for instance, due to different shielding
of the hydrophobic amino acids from the environment.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have investigated the
effect of terminal modifications
on the assembly of hIAPP(20–29) in bulk solution and at molecularly
defined interfaces using a selection of complementary in situ and
ex situ techniques. In bulk solution, fluorescence spectroscopy did
not show any β-sheet-specific increase of ThT fluorescence.
Nevertheless, AFM revealed the formation of prefibrillar particle-like
aggregates with different sizes and morphologies. Whereas the amidated
(+|0) and the acetylated and amidated (0|0) fragments were both found
to form homogeneous particles of similar sizes, the acetylated (0|-)
and especially the native (+|-) fragments form morphologically more
diverse aggregates. These morphological differences translated into
different contents of antiparallel β-sheets. In particular,
the aggregates of the native (+|-) and acetylated (0|-) fragments
showed only small contributions from antiparallel β-sheets (1–4%),
whereas C-terminal amidation resulted in larger contents of around
10%. These results demonstrate that terminal modifications may significantly
affect several aspects of peptide self-assembly, the results of which
may not be obvious at first glance and require the application of
several complementary analytical techniques to be fully revealed.

The terminal modifications were found to result also in sometimes
pronouncedly different adsorption and assembly behaviors at different
hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. Also here, several complementary
in situ and ex situ techniques were applied and revealed a fairly
complex picture of the effect of the terminal modifications on the
interaction with the different SAMs. Comparison of in situ QCM-D and
ex situ PM-IRRAS data revealed significant differences in the trends
of adsorbed mass with fragment species, indicating strong variations
in the amount of trapped or hydrodynamically coupled water between
fragments. However, these fragment-specific differences did not follow
a general trend but varied from surface to surface, which makes them
hard to rationalize. Also, the total β-sheet contents of the
adsorbed hIAPP(20–29) films varied significantly from fragment
to fragment in a surface-specific way. Most notably, for all terminally
modified fragments in contact with the different SAMs, significantly
reduced contents of antiparallel β-sheets were observed. This
effect was most pronounced for the polar OH- and the hydrophobic
CH3-terminated SAMs for which antiparallel β-sheet
contents were essentially zero for all fragments.

Adsorption
of hIAPP(20–29) at the positively charged NH2-terminated
SAM seems to be governed to a large extent by
electrostatic interactions, with fragment-specific contributions of
hydrogen bond formation. Despite the apparent lack of any large aggregate
structures at the NH2 SAM, PM-IRRAS revealed that this
surface is able to promote β-sheet formation in a peptide-specific
way.

In contrast to the positively charged NH2 SAM,
electrostatic
interactions seem to be less important for hIAPP(20–29) adsorption
to the negatively charged COOH SAM. Most notably, we found that the
often observed effect of negatively charged interfaces promoting hIAPP
amyloid formation21,22,74−76 depends on the molecular structure of the peptide
termini. Although increased β-sheet formation was observed for
all fragments, the increase in β-sheet content varied drastically
from fragment to fragment.

Our results obtained for the polar
OH SAM are less conclusive.
Here, the comparison between QCM-D and PM-IRRAS indicates a pronounced
role of coupled water and the occurrence of peculiar monomer conformations
in the adsorbate films upon drying that obscures the amide bonds from
interrogation by PM-IRRAS. These issues seem to affect in particular
the fragments with native N terminus, which prevents us from drawing
any solid conclusions concerning this SAM.

For all hIAPP(20–29)
fragments, contact with the hydrophobic
CH3-terminated SAM resulted in low adsorption and the formation
of amyloid fibrils several microns in length. However, significant
differences in fibril morphology and density were observed and could
be correlated with the β-sheet content. In particular, the native
fragment assembled into ribbonlike fibrils with about 40% β-sheet
content, whereas all terminally modified fragments formed straight
fibrils with increased β-sheet contents of 50–60%. These
observations are particularly noteworthy as the interaction between
the hIAPP(20–29) fragments with the CH3 SAM should
not involve the termini at all. Therefore, we assume that the observed
differences in adsorbed mass, fibril morphology, and molecular structure
are to a large extent the result of different monomer conformations
with different accessibilities of the hydrophobic amino acid residues.

Our results demonstrate that terminal modifications can have tremendous
effects on peptide adsorption and aggregation, even for comparatively
simple model peptides such as hIAPP(20–29). The effects exerted
by the terminal modifications can be further modulated in nontrivial
ways by the physicochemical properties of the SAM surface. This also
concerns cases in which adsorption is not mediated by the termini
but by the amino acid residues only. Therefore, terminal modifications
are an important factor to consider when conducting and comparing
peptide adsorption and aggregation studies and may represent an additional
parameter for guiding the assembly of peptide-based nanomaterials.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Peptide Synthesis and Purification
Peptides were prepared using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
(Fmoc) chemistry with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium
hexafluorophosphate as the coupling reagent on an automated solid-phase
peptide synthesizer (ResPep SL, Intavis). For synthesizing peptide
amide, Rink amide resin (TentaGel, Rapp Polymere, Germany) was used.
For synthesizing peptide acid, Wang resin (TentaGel, Rapp Polymere,
Germany) was used. Each amino acid was coupled twice at 5-fold excess
followed by capping the nonreacted amino groups with acetic anhydride
to achieve high-quality synthesis. For synthesizing acetylated peptide,
an additional capping reaction was performed after the last Fmoc deprotection.
The peptide was then cleaved from the resin with trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA)/triisopropylsilane/water/dithiothreitol (90(v/v):5(v/v):2.5(v/v):2.5(m/v))
for 2 h. The product was precipitated and washed with ice-cold diethyl
ether.

The precipitated peptide was solved in Milli-Q water/acetonitrile
(1:1) and further purified using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) on semipreparative HPLC (Waters) equipped with
a semipreparative column (PolymerX RP-1, Phenomenex). The mobile phase
was represented by a gradient of 0.1% TFA in water (100–5%)
and 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (5–100%). The fraction containing
the product was submitted to analytical reverse-phase ultrahigh-pressure
liquid chromatography (UPLC Aquity with UV Detector) equipped with
an analytical C18 column (ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18, bead size 1.7 μm,
50 × 2.1 mm2), which uses an anisocratic gradient
and is directly connected to an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer
(ACQUITY TQ Detector). Peptide structures can be confirmed on the
basis of the molecular weight. Finally, the fraction containing the
product was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C.

4.2 Sample Preparation
To prepare homogenous
monomer solutions, one milligram of hIAPP(20–29) was carefully
dissolved in 100 μL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (≥99%,
Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h with occasional vortexing. The solution was
then centrifuged at 15 000 rpm and 4 °C for 30 min, after
which the top 80% of the total volume was removed and divided into
10 μL aliquots. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
lyophilized for 5 h. The lyophilized hIAPP(20–29) aliquots
were stored at −20 °C.

4.3 Peptide
Assembly in Bulk Solution
Thioflavin T (ThT, Sigma-Aldrich)
was freshly prepared before each
experiment at 3 mg/mL in HPLC-grade water (ROTH). The solution was
then filtered through a 0.2 μm filter (VWR) and ThT concentration
calculated from its absorbance in water at 412 nm measured on an Implen
Nanophotometer using a molar extinction coefficient of 36 000
M–1 cm–1.

Before the experiment,
∼2 μL of the freshly prepared ThT solution was mixed
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM
Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, VWR) to reach a final volume
and ThT concentration of 495 μL and 20 μM, respectively.
The frozen hIAPP(20–29) sample was allowed to reach room temperature
and dissolved in 10 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.7%,
Sigma-Aldrich) by vortexing for 30 s. The dissolved peptide in DMSO
was kept at room temperature for 10 min, after which 5 μL of
the peptide–DMSO solution was added to the test tube containing
495 μL of PBS and ThT to yield a final concentration of 100
μM. After vortexing for 15 s, the sample was transferred into
a clean fluorescence cuvette (Hellma), and a fluorescence emission
spectrum was recorded using a JASCO FP-8200ST fluorescence spectrometer
in the range from 445 to 700 nm (440 nm excitation) at a speed of
500 nm/min. Spectra were averaged over three individual measurements.
The cuvette was then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and remeasured
at intervals of a few hours.

An identical sample but without
ThT was incubated in a test tube
along the cuvette. After 24 h, the sample was vortexed before depositing
100 μL on a freshly cleaved mica surface. After incubation for
15 min, the mica sample was washed with MQ water and dried with a
stream of ultrapure air for AFM imaging. For PM-IRRAS, ∼140
μL of the hIAPP(20–29) solution was deposited on RCA1-cleaned
gold-coated silicon wafers. To record representative PM-IRRA spectra
that include all hIAPP(20–29) species present in bulk solution,
the samples were left to dry and characterized without additional
washing.

4.4 SAM Formation
1-Octadecanethiol,
11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, 11-mercapto-1-undecanol, and 11-amino-1-undecanethiol
hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) were each dissolved in ethanol to a
final concentration of 1 mM. Gold-coated quartz crystal sensors (Filtech
Inc.) were cleaned in RCA1 (1:1:5 35% H2O2,
25% NH3, water) for 5 min at 75 °C and immersed in
the respective solutions for 24 h to form SAM-terminated surfaces.
Immediately prior to the experiment, the SAM-coated sensors were rinsed
with ethanol and dried with nitrogen. Successful SAM formation was
verified using contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy.21

4.5 QCM-D
Right before the experiment,
eight hIAPP(20–29) aliquots were slowly brought to room temperature
and dissolved in 10 μL of DMSO each. After incubation at room
temperature for 10 min, all eight DMSO–peptide aliquots were
transferred into a single tube containing 7920 μL of PBS to
reach a final concentration of 100 μM hIAPP(20–29). After
vortexing for 15 s, the sample solution was injected into the QCM-D
chamber.

QCM-D measurements were performed using a Q-Sense E4
(Biolin Scientific) at 37 °C in dynamic mode. After stabilization
of the QCM-D system with peptide-free PBS, hIAPP(20–29)-containing
buffer was injected into the cells at 10 μL/min. After 13.5
h, the QCM-D cells were flushed with peptide-free PBS for 120 min.
Frequency and dissipation shifts were evaluated for the 7th overtone.
All QCM-D measurements have been performed up to three times, and
similar trends have been observed.

After the measurements, the
quartz sensors were removed from the
cells, washed with MQ water, and dried in a stream of ultrapure air
for AFM imaging and PM-IRRAS.

4.6 AFM
Ex situ AFM imaging was performed
in intermittent contact mode in air using JPK Nanowizard II and
JPK Nanowizard III AFMs and HQ:NSC18/Al BS cantilevers from MikroMasch
with a nominal force constant and tip radius of 2.8 N/m and 8 nm,
respectively.

4.7 PM-IRRAS
The chemical
analysis of
the dried hIAPP(20–29) fragments on gold surfaces was performed
by means of PM-IRRAS using a Bruker Vertex 70 (Bruker Optics).
The samples were analyzed with a resolution of 4 cm–1 at an angle of 80°. A ZnSe Photo-Elastic-Modulator (PMA50,
Bruker) was used to apply 50 kHz modulation to an aluminum wire grid
to receive p-polarized light. The light, reflected by the sample,
was focused by a ZnSe lens and collected with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled
mercury cadmium telluride detector. The obtained original spectra
were constrained to the relevant spectral range and background corrected
between 1725 and 1500 cm–1 (amide I and amide II
regions) for subsequent deconvolution. A second derivative analysis
has been carried out to unveil the unresolved spectral contributions,
mostly in the amide I peak region.83 Subsequently,
spectra were fitted with Gaussian band profiles using OPUS 5.5 software
(see SI for details of the deconvolution
of the spectra). The integral areas corresponding to the amide I peak
have been obtained by adding the contributions of the different components
in the range of 1610–1700 cm–1.
