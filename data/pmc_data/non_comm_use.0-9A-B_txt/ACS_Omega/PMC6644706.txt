In order to solve the uneven distribution
of copper sulfide nanocrystals
(CuS-NCs) on cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), this work reports a feasible
method to in situ precipitate CuS-NCs on CNF by utilizing biopolymers
(lignin, xylan, or starch) as stabilizer and adhesive for fabricating
the multifunctional composite papers. In the presence of biopolymers,
CuS-NCs deposited in situ on CNF could be capped and stabilized by
the biopolymers molecular chains for uniform distribution. Subsequently,
biopolymers could anchor CuS-NCs on CNF by the hydrogen bonding. Compared
to the composite paper with lignin or xylan as stabilizer and adhesive,
CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper showed the highest content and most uniform
and continuous distribution of CuS-NCs, which not only enhanced the
conductivity of composite paper to 10.12 S/cm but also increased the
reaction rate constant on photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine
B to 0.317 min–1. The reaction rate constant is
higher than most of the other reported CuS photocatalysts to date.
It indicates that our method has a potential to be a novel strategy
to precipitate nanocrystals uniformly on cellulose fibers for fabricating
the multifunctional composite paper.

==== Body
Introduction
Copper sulfide (CuS), a p-type semiconductor
with a 1.2–2.0
eV of direct band gap,1 has been extensively
applied in industry and biomedical field due to its typical optical,
electronic, physical, and chemical properties, for instance, as cathode
materials in lithium rechargeable batteries, light-emitting diodes,
solar cells, photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, photothermal
ablation of tumor cells, and biology markers.2−7 So far, there have been only few reports on CuS-NC-based multifunctional
composite paper. Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs), a low-cost raw material
from renewable resources, can disperse well in aqueous solution by
their large number of hydroxyl groups, which could also provide nucleation
sites for nanocrystals.8,9 Thus, CNF has potential as an
effective template and dispersant for in situ precipitation of nanocrystals.10 However, due to the high surface area of CuS-NCs11,12 and no bondability between CuS-NCs and CNF, CuS-NCs tend to distribute
unevenly or fall off from CNF. Therefore, a stabilizer and adhesive
is necessary for dispersing and anchoring CuS-NCs on CNF. Recent reports
show that the biopolymers could act as stabilizer during the growth
of nanocrystals.13−15 In the presence of biopolymers, the formed nanocrystals
could be capped and stabilized by the biopolymer chains.14 On the other hand, biopolymers could also anchor
nanocrystals on CNF by hydrogen bonding as an adhesive.16

In this study, a new type of multifunctional
composite paper was
fabricated by utilizing the biopolymers (lignin, xylan, or starch)
as stabilizer and adhesive for in situ precipitation of CuS-NCs on
CNF. The effects of the three types of biopolymers on improving the
distribution of CuS-NCs on CNF were contrasted, and the electrical
conductivity and photocatalytic activity of composite papers were
evaluated.

Results and Discussion
In Situ Precipitation of CuS-NCs on Biopolymer-Coated
CNFs
The distribution of NCs in paper network affects the
applications
of the composite papers.9,19 The in situ precipitation
technology is beneficial to the uniform distribution of NCs on cellulose
fibers.20,21Figure 1 shows the fabrication of composite fibers. First,
the CuS-NCs/CNFs were synthesized as shown in Figure 1A. CNFs possessed large amounts of hydroxyl
groups, which provided them with a good ability to disperse in aqueous
medium. And hydroxyl group also provided a nucleation site for CuS-NCs
by binding [Cu(NH3)4]2+. Finally,
the addition of S2– led to the nucleation and growth
of CuS-NCs in the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ enrichment
for in situ precipitation of the CNF. In this case, CuS-NCs were unevenly
distributed on CNF (as shown in the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
image in Figure 1i).

composite fiber, (iii) CNF/xylan/CuS NCs composite fiber, (iv) and
CNF/starch/CuS NCs composite fiber.

To improve the distribution of CuS-NCs on CNFs, natural biopolymers
(e.g., lignin, xylan, or starch) are introduced as a “green”
stabilizer and adhesive during the in situ precipitation of CuS-NCs
on CNFs. The CuS-NCs/biopolymer/CNF composite fibers were fabricated
as shown in Figure 1B. The dissolved biopolymers formed a composite template with CNF
by hydrogen bonding. Then, [Cu(NH3)4]2+ enriched on biopolymer/CNF hybrid chains, which provided the nucleation
sites for crystallization of CuS-NCs. Finally, the addition of S2– led to the nucleation and growth of CuS-NCs in the
[Cu(NH3)4]2+ enrichment for in situ
precipitation on the CNF. In the presence of biopolymers, CuS-NCs
deposited in situ on CNF could be capped and stabilized by the biopolymers
molecular chains for uniform distribution. Subsequently, biopolymers
could anchor CuS-NCs on CNF by the hydrogen bonding after drying.
The SEM images (Figure 1ii–iv) show the morphologies of CuS-NCs/biopolymer/CNF composite
fibers. The precipitation of CuS-NCs on CuS-NCs/lignin/CNFs composite
fiber formed a nanosheet with uneven distribution (Figure 1ii). But the uniform distribution
of CuS-NCs could be observed on CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF composite fiber
(Figure 1iii) and CuS-NCs/starch/CNF
composite fiber (Figure 1iv). It indicates that the distribution of CuS-NCs was strongly related
to the molecular configuration and properties of biopolymers. For
example, lignin contains a large amount of hydroxyl groups and shows
the properties of aliphatic compounds and aromatic compounds,13 which can be used as a stabilizer for nanocrystals.
However, its ability to control the growth orientation of nanocrystals
is poor because of its relatively short molecular chains.22 In addition, the binding ability between lignin
and cellulose fibers is relatively weak,23 which is not beneficial to anchoring CuS-NCs on CNFs. Compared to
lignin, the xylan and starch molecules not only possess a large number
of hydroxyl groups but also have long helical chains or random coils,24,25 which could cap and stabilize nanocrystals more effectively. Notably,
the nanoparticles on CuS-NCs/starch/CNF composite fiber (Figure 1iv) were smaller
and showed a more uniform distribution than on CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF composite
fiber (Figure 1iii).
Due to the presence of long B-chains with widely spaced side chains
in amylopectins,26 the molecular structure
of starch was more conducive to stabilizing and anchoring CuS-NCs
on CNF.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD),
and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) of Composite Papers
The interaction between biopolymers and CNF was studied by FT-IR
spectra. FT-IR spectra of biopolymers, CNF paper, CuS-NCs/CNF paper,
and CuS-NCs/biopolymer/CNF paper are shown in Figure 2. There were absorption peaks at 3500 and
3429 cm–1 for CNF paper and biopolymers, respectively,
which were all assigned to −OH stretching.27,28 In contrast, the absorption at 3500 cm–1 for CuS-NCs/CNF
paper did not decrease, confirming there is no hydrogen bonding between
CuS-NCs and CNF. Noteworthily, from the FT-IR spectrum of CuS-NCs/biopolymer/CNF
paper, it was found that the absorbance at 3500 and 3429 cm–1 became weak, which confirms the hydrogen bonding between biopolymers
and CNF.29

Figure 2 FT-IR spectra of starch, xylan, lignin,
CNF paper, CuS-NCs/CNF
paper, CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper, CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper, and CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF
paper.

The XRD patterns of the CNF composite
papers are shown in Figure 3. Compared to CNF
paper, characteristic diffraction peaks (corresponding to facets (100),
(101), (102), (103), (006), (110), (108), and (116)) of CuS appeared
on CuS-NCs/CNF paper, which match with the peaks in JCPDS (no. 06-0464).
It demonstrates that CuS-NCs were successfully precipitated on the
CNF. Actually, the phase of CuS-NCs transformed from Cu2S at the “copper-rich” side to CuS2 at the
“copper-deficient” side during in situ precipitation,
such as CuS, Cu1.96S, Cu1.94S, Cu1.8S, Cu7S4, and Cu2S.30 Eventually, the phase of CuS-NCs was CuS2 due
to the sufficient and fully released S2– from Na2S, which could be demonstrated by the characteristic diffraction
peaks type of CuS-NCs in composite papers. The significant characteristic
diffraction peaks of CuS also appeared on CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper,
but the characteristic diffraction peaks were obviously weakened on
CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper and CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper. It can be explained
that the helical chains or random coils structure of xylan and starch
molecules24,25 was more conducive to capping and stabilizing
CuS-NCs, thus shadowing the diffraction peaks of CuS-NCs.31

Figure 3 XRD patterns of CNF paper, CuS-NCs/CNF paper, CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF
paper, CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper, and CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper.

TGA images of the CNF composite
papers are shown in Figure 4. The initial degradation temperature
of CuS NCs/CNF paper was lower than that of CNF paper due to the pyrolysis
of CuS at ∼200 °C.32 Then,
the initial degradation temperature of composite papers with biopolymers
(CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper, CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper, and CuS-NCs/starch/CNF
paper) shifted to lower temperature due to the carbonization of biopolymers
under nitrogen flow. In addition, the weight residue of composite
papers is higher than that of CNF paper because of the presence of
CuS-NCs in CNF networks. Compared to CuS-NCs/CNF paper, the weight
residues of CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper and CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper are
lower, indicating the decrease of CuS-NCs retention. This is in agreement
with the CuS-NCs content in composite papers in Table 1 (30.82% of CuS-NCs in CuS-NCs/CNF paper;
22.73% of CuS-NCs in CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper; 17.73% of CuS-NCs in
CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper). The higher CuS-NCs content in CuS-NCs/CNF
paper can be explained by the large CuS-NCs in CuS-NCs/CNF paper (SEM
image in Figure 5a),
which resulted in the increase of retention of CuS-NCs. Due to the
stabilizing effect of lignin and xylan, the large CuS-NCs in CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF
paper and CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper were reduced in size (SEM images
in Figure 5c,e), while
the lower CuS-NCs content in CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper and CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF
paper suggests that the lignin and xylan possessed a weaker ability
to anchor CuS-NCs on CNF. Interestingly, CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper
showed the highest weight residue, which is in agreement with 35.48%
of CuS-NCs content in CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper in Table 1. Due to the stabilizing effect
of starch, large CuS-NCs in CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper were the fewest
(SEM image in Figure 5g), while the highest CuS-NCs content in CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper
indicates that the starch provided a strong ability to anchor CuS-NCs
on CNF for increasing the retention of CuS-NCs. It should be noted
that due to the low content of biopolymers in the composite papers
(8.5 wt % of lignin, 8.5 wt % of xylan, and 4.4 wt % of starch), the
quantity after high-temperature carbonization was very low, which
did not affect the weight residue result. In addition, the low content
of biopolymers would not affect the conductivity and photocatalytic
activity of composite papers.

Effect of CuS-NCs Distribution on Electrical
Conductivity and
Photocatalytic Activity of Composite Papers
The distribution
of CuS-NCs on CNFs may have a significant effect on the performance
of composite papers. In the presence of biopolymers, CuS-NCs deposited
in situ on CNF could be capped and stabilized by the biopolymer molecular
chains for uniform distribution. With the drying process of composite
paper, the hydrogen bonding between the biopolymer and CNF was enhanced,
and the CuS-NCs were firmly anchored on the CNF to prepare composite
paper with uniform distribution of CuS-NCs. As shown in Figure 5a, the light bulb connected
with CuS-NCs/CNF paper presented the weakest light. This is because
of the lowest conductivity of CuS-NCs/CNF paper (0.94 S/cm). Although
the CuS-NCs content in CuS-NCs/CNF paper was higher than that in CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF
paper and CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper (Table 1) due to the formation of large CuS-NCs in
CNF network without biopolymers as stabilizer (SEM image in Figure 5a), the uneven and
discontinuous distribution of CuS-NCs on CNF (Figure 5b) was not conducive to the conduction of
electrons between fibers, resulting in the lowest conductivity of
CuS-NCs/CNF paper. In contrast, the light bulb connected with CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF
paper, CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper, or CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper showed
a stronger light (Figure 5c,e,g). It suggests that the addition of biopolymers was beneficial
to the improvement of conductivity of composite papers (2.78 S/cm
for CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper, 3.33 S/cm for CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF paper,
and 10.12 S/cm for CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper). Biopolymer acted as
a stabilizer and adhesive to promote the uniform and continuous distribution
of CuS-NCs on CNF (Figure 5d,f,h), which contributed to improving the electrical conduction
between the CNF and increasing the conductivity of composite papers.
Although the CuS-NCs content in CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper and CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF
paper was lower (Table 1), the uniform and continuous distribution of CuS-NCs on CNF (Figure 5d,f) was beneficial
to improve the conduction of electrons between fibers. This is the
reason for their higher conductivity than CuS-NCs/CNF paper. Noteworthily,
CuS-NCs/starch/CNFs composite paper possessed the highest conductivity,
due to the presence of long B-chains with widely spaced side chains
in amylopectins26 and the molecular structure
of starch more conducive to stabilizing and anchoring CuS-NCs on CNF,
resulting in the highest content (Table 1) and most uniform and continuous distribution
of CuS-NCs (Figure 5h).

Otelaja et al.33 reported highly
conductive CuS nanoparticle films via electrophoretic deposition.
The traditional spin-casting method can yield CuS films with a conductivity
of 5.7 S/cm. In contrast, the CuS nanoparticle films prepared by electrophoretic
deposition consistently have an order of magnitude higher conductivity
(up to 75 S/cm) due to the formation of smaller CuS nanoparticles
and thinner film. Lee et al.34 reported
a Cu2S-multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) hybrid nanostructures
by in situ growing of Cu2S-NCs on MWCNTs. The uniform growth
of small Cu2S-NCs on MWCNTs improved the electrochemical
performance of composites as solar cells. In our study, CuS-NCs were
deposited in situ on CNFs with lignin, xylan, or starch as stabilizer
and adhesive to form a uniform and continuous CuS-NCs cladding structure
in composite paper. This is the reason for the high conductivity of
composite papers. In contrast, CuS-NCs/starch/CNFs composite paper
showed the highest conductivity due to the smallest CuS-NCs and the
most uniform cladding structure in composite paper.

Photocatalysis
is a process that when a semiconductor materials
absorbs light, the absorption of photon energy is equal to or more
than the band gap of the semiconductor, and then generates electrons
and holes, which can further produce free radicals in the system to
oxidize the semiconductor.35 For composite
papers as photocatalyst, near-infrared (NIR) light as a light source
can provide an energy to create electron–hole pairs on the
surface of CuS-NCs for triggering the photocatalytic step. The excited
electron reacts with dissolved O2 to form O2–, and the holes react with surface hydroxyl groups
to form OH• radicals, which will oxidize the organic
dye.7 In case of RhB, the characteristic
absorption peak at 552 nm was used to monitor the photocatalytic dye
degradation reaction.

As shown in Figure 6, the photocatalytic activities of four composite
papers were estimated
by monitoring the decreased intensity of RhB at 552 nm under various
NIR laser (808 nm, 1.5 W/cm2) exposure times. The RhB did
not degrade under NIR laser irradiation in the absence of composite
papers (Figure 6a).
With composite papers as photocatalyst, the time required for the
composite papers with lignin, xylan, or starch as stabilizer and adhesive
to completely degrade RhB (<20 min, Figure 6c–e) was shorter than that of CuS-NCs/CNF
paper (24 min, Figure 6b). In addition, Figure 6f shows that photocatalytic decomposition reaction constant
(k) increased following the increase of uniform distribution
of CuS-NCs on CNFs. Notably, the k value in CuS-NCs/starch/CNFs
group is 0.317 min–1, which is higher than most
of the other CuS photocatalysts reported to date.7,36,37 It can be explained by the high content
(Table 1) and uniform
distribution of CuS-NCs (Figure 5h) in CuS-NCs/starch/CNFs paper. The measured specific
surface areas of the composite papers based on N2 were
181.8 m2/g for CuS-NCs/CNF paper, 246.7 m2/g
for CuS-NCs/lignin/CNF paper, 284.5 m2/g for CuS-NCs/xylan/CNF
paper, and 365.3 m2/g for CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper. It
indicates that improving the distribution of CuS-NCs on CNFs by the
biopolymers could increase the specific surface area of CuS-NCs, resulting
in more unsaturated surface coordination sites exposed to the reactants
and decreasing the degradation time. Furthermore, the use of composite
paper as photocatalyst can avoid secondary pollution and is beneficial
to the recycling. As shown in Figure 6g, RhB maintained comparatively high degradation efficiency
without any significant decrease even after running for 10 cycles
with composite paper as photocatalyst. Compared to other composite
papers, RhB showed the highest degradation efficiency with CuS-NCs/starch/CNF
paper as photocatalyst because of its highest content and most uniform
distribution of CuS-NCs.

sides for 100 times each, followed by immersing in deionized water;

after sonication for 30 min at 360 W; 0′: sheets before photodegradation;
5′: sheets after 5 times photodegradation; 10′: sheets
after 10 times photodegradation.

The stability of composite papers is shown in Figure 6h. The deionized water of soaked
composite papers was all clear without dark green of CuS-NCs after
rubbing, washing, or sonication, which proves that there was no significant
leaking of CuS-NCs from composite papers. It suggests the good stability
of CuS-NCs in composite papers due to the stabilizer and adhesive
effect of biopolymers. We also studied the stability of the composite
papers in cycle photodegradation. As shown in Figure 6h, the CuS-NCs/CNF paper collapsed a little
after 10 times photocatalysis. Except for this, the other composite
papers did not collapse after 5 or 10 times photodegradation due to
the adhesive effect of biopolymers in composite papers. Therefore,
the use of composite papers as photocatalyst can avoid secondary pollution
and is beneficial to the recycling.

Conclusions
In
summary, we report a feasible method to in situ precipitate
CuS-NCs on CNF by utilizing biopolymers (lignin, xylan, or starch)
as stabilizer and adhesive for fabricating the multifunctional composite
papers. The biopolymers could cap and stabilize the in situ deposited
CuS-NCs and anchor CuS-NCs on CNF by hydrogen bonding. Compared to
the composite paper with lignin or xylan as stabilizer and adhesive,
CuS-NCs/starch/CNF paper showed the highest content and most uniform
and continuous distribution of CuS-NCs, inducing the highest conductivity
and reaction rate constant on the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine
B. This novel strategy provides an alternative for uniform and stable
deposition of nanocrystals on cellulose fibers.

Experimental Section
Materials
CNFs were purchased from Intelligent Chemicals
Pty Ltd (Guangzhou, China). Their average fiber length and fiber diameter
were 4–6 μm and 10–50 nm, respectively. Lignin
(Mn: 1700 g/mol) was recovered from soda
pulping effluent of the State Key Laboratory of Pulp & Paper Engineering
(Guangzhou, China). The functional groups attached to lignin benzene
rings and side chain include −OCH3 (16.0%), −C=O,
COOH (7.2%), OH alcohol, OH phenolic (2.6%), and so on. This lignin
was hydrophobic and was well dispersed in sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
solution. Xylan (Mw: 4.9 × 104 g/mol) isolated from bagasse was purchased from Shanghai
Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The sugar composition
was as follows: 87.35% xylose, 9.28% arabinose, 0.81% glucose, 0.50%
galactose, and 2.06% glucuronic acid. This xylan was hydrophobic and
well dispersed in NaOH solution. Corn starch (Mw: 2.7 × 107 g/mol) without any chemical treatment
was purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). The amylose/amylopectin ratio of starch was 1:3. This starch
was hydrophilic and was well dispersed after cooking. Sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), ammonia (25–28%),
copper sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O), and sodium
sulfide nonahydrate (Na2S·9H2O) were all
of analytical grade.

Preparation of Composite Papers
CuSO4·5H2O (0.4 g) was dissolved in water
(50 mL). Then, diluted ammonia
(7 M, 15 mL) was added dropwise to the CuSO4·5H2O solution under constant stirring. Deep blue copper–amine
complex ([Cu(NH3)4]2+) was obtained
after the light blue basic copper sulfate precipitation disappeared.17

Lignin and xylan were dissolved in 2 wt
% aqueous NaOH, respectively, to prepare 0.04 wt % 50 mL lignin/NaOH
solution and xylan/NaOH solution; starch was cooked in deionized water
with stirring at 95 °C for 1 h to prepare 0.02 wt % 50 mL starch
aqueous solution. The above three solutions were added into 50 mL
of CNFs pulp (homogenized by D-130 homogenizer, dry weight of 0.126
g) and stirred at a given temperature (room temperature for lignin
and xylan, 90 °C for starch) for 30 min. Then, the [Cu(NH3)4]2+ solution was added into the above
mixtures and stirred for 1 h at the corresponding temperature. Finally,
Na2S·9H2O (4 wt %, 20 mL) was added dropwise
to the above solution under stirring at the corresponding temperature
and reacted for 30 min. After the reaction, the suspensions were dialyzed
until S2– was completely removed (the dialysate
was tested with CuCl2 until no precipitate appeared).17 After dialysis, the volume of the suspensions
was 200 mL and wet sheets were obtained by suction filtration of 100
mL suspensions with 0.22 μm membrane. Then, the wet sheets were
dried at 60 °C to prepare the composite papers. The unified composite
paper specifications are as follows: 12.56 cm2 size; 0.15
± 0.008 mm thickness; and 50 g/m2 basis weight. In
addition, the composite fibers for SEM observation were obtained after
dialyzed suspension lyophilizing at −40 °C for 36 h. The
filtrate was titrated with sulfuric acid to calculate the mass of
CuS-NCs detached from the wet sheets, and the CuS-NCs content in composite
paper was estimated by the following equation  where A1 is the
total weight of generated CuS-NCs, A2 is
the weight of CuS-NCs detached from the wet sheets, and A is the weight of composite paper.

Characterization of Composite
Papers
The morphological
and structural characteristics of the composite fibers and composite
papers were investigated using an EVO-18 scanning electron microscope
(SEM, Zeiss, Germany). The FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Tensor
27 (Bruker, Germany) under dry air at room temperature by a KBr pellet
method; each sample was scanned from 4000 to 500 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. The composite papers
for SEM were dried at 60 °C for 6 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of the crystal structure were recorded on a D8 Advance X-ray
diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV with a scanning rate of 2°/min and a scanning
scope of 20–80° (2θ). The thermal degradation study
was carried out using a Q-500 thermogravimetric analyzer (TA) at a
nitrogen flow rate of 30 mL/min and a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined
by N2 physisorption18 using
an ASAP2020HD88 Micromeritics automated system. The paper sample was
first degassed at 115 °C for 4 h prior to the analysis by N2 adsorption at −196 °C, and BET analysis was carried
out for a relative vapor pressure of 0.01–0.3 at −196
°C.

Electrical Conductivity and Photocatalytic Activity of Composite
Papers
Sheet resistances (Rs,
Ω/aq) of the composite papers were measured by a four-probe
method using a multielectrical measurement system (FT-340, Ningbo,
China), and the corresponding volume conductivities (σ, S/cm)
were calculated by the formula: σ = 1/(Rst), where t (cm) is the
paper thickness. The composite papers for conductivity test were cut
into 2 cm square sheets. The distance between electrodes was 2.35
mm, and the test current was 10 mA.

The composite papers (1.5
cm2 size; 0.15 ± 0.008 mm thickness; 50 g/m2 basis weight) were immersed in rhodamine B (RhB) solution (2.0 ×
10–5 mol/L, 50 mL), followed by dropping 1 mL of
H2O2 and then NIR laser (808 nm, 1.5 W/cm2) irradiation on the composite paper through the RhB solution
in the dark. The Optocouplers laser (MW-GX-808/1–5000 mW) was
purchased from Leishi Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. (Changchun,
China). RhB solution (5 mL) was sucked out at designed time interval
to test the UV–vis spectra by TU-1810 (Beijing, China) with
a scan range of 800–400 nm. The kinetic study was performed
by measuring the change in the intensity of the absorbance at 552
nm. The photocatalytic decomposition reaction of RhB can be modeled
as a pseudo-first-order reaction with the kinetics expressed by the
equation as follows  where A is absorbance, t is the time, and k is reaction rate constant.
So, the plot of ln A vs t gives
a straight line having a negative slope.

The reusable performance
was investigated by the change of the
degradation efficiency after several cycles of photocatalysis. We
note that the rinse method of composite papers between the photocatalytic
cycles was as follows: the composite papers were sandwiched from the
RhB solution and 50 mL of deionized water was drawn several times
with a dropper to wash the front and back surfaces of the composite
papers. The degradation efficiency of RhB was calculated using the
following equation  where A0 and A1 are the absorbances of RhB solution at 552
nm before and after photocatalytic reaction.

The stability of
the composite papers was investigated after the
following treatments: rubbing the sheets on both sides 100 times each,
followed by immersing in deionized water; washing the sheets 100 times
with deionized water in the beaker, followed by immersing in it; and
immersing in deionized water after sonication by a KQ-600GKDV ultrasonic
cleaner (Kunshan, China) for 30 min at 360 W. The images of the composite
papers were taken before and after photodegradation for several times.
