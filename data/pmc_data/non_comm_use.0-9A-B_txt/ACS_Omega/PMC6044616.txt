An
amphiphilic pyrene derivative exhibiting unusually stable excimer
emission due to strong aggregation is presented. The aggregated system
served as an intelligent sensor for metal ions and nitro explosives
in aqueous media. The excimer displayed excellent selectivity toward
Cu2+ among the tested cations. The observation
was interpreted on the basis of chelation of metal ions involving
the hydroxyl and amino groups of two molecules, leading to the ligand-to-metal
charge-transfer (CT) process. The excimer was further applied for
the cell imaging of Cu2+ ions. Also, while treating the
excimer with various nitro explosives, it displayed efficient 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
sensing, corroborating mainly the CT process from pyrene to the analyte
due to intercalation of the analyte within pyrene.

==== Body
Introduction
Pyrene is a unique
fluorophore that exhibits distinct monomer (λmono = 370–400 nm) and excimer fluorescence (λexc = 420–600 nm) depending on the distance (d > 1 nm and 0.4 nm < d < 1 nm, respectively)
between two pyrene moieties.1−3 Either the formation or the destruction
of the excimer in the presence of external inputs rendered pyrene
a versatile fluorophore for probing specific noncovalent interactions
in biology (e.g., protein conformation,4,5 binding,6 etc.) and chemistry7,8 (e.g., chemosensors
for cations,9−12 anions,13,14 nitro explosives,15−17 etc.). Sensors,
which exhibit excimer fluorescence in their latent form, are designed
mostly via covalent linking of two or more pyrene moieties to a recognition
domain. Such a connection of pyrenes ensures intramolecular aggregation
of the fluorophore, resulting in strong and stable excimer emission.
Over the past several years, numerous chemosensors have been developed,
applying the pyrene excimer for detecting different species of interest.18−23 There are very few multifunctional sensors reported which can detect
more than one type of analyte;24 however,
they use the same recognition site.25,26 Chemosensors
that employ different recognition sites for the detection of two distinct
classes of analytes are rare. Kaur and co-workers have reported a
phenanthro[4,5-fgh]pyrido[2,3-b]quinoxaline
derivative that displayed red-shifted excimer emission in the presence
of Hg2+ ions via coordination with the aromatic ring nitrogen.27 The probe was also able to sense nitroaromatics
through electron energy transfer from the probe to the analyte, resulting
in the quenching of excimer emission.28 The research group of Cao reported 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene and
1,3,5-tris(4-bromophenyl)benzene as monomers to synthesize a series
of porous covalent organic polymers (COPs) displaying strong emission
above 500 nm. These COPs were able to sense metal ions and nitroaromatics
through quenching of fluorescence.29 Most
of these chemosensors typically work in organic media. Other examples
of pyrene-based chemosensors capable of sensing two different classes
of analytes are (1) conjugated polymer-based nanospongy continuous
structures reported by Kim and co-workers for detecting transition-metal
ions and nitroaromatics,30 (2) a pyrene-linked
thiourea derivative reported by Velmathi and co-workers for detecting
metal ions and picric acid,31 (3) a ferrocene-triazole
derivative reported by Oton and co-workers for detecting ion pairs,32 (4) a metal-organic framework reported by Moorthy
and co-workers for sensing solvent polarity and nitroaromatics,33 and so forth.

Herein, we report an intermolecular
pyrene-aggregation-based strong
excimer that is unusually stable in aqueous media. The system is an
intelligent sensor that utilizes two different recognition sites for
sensing two distinct classes of analytes, viz., metal ions and nitroaromatics,
through different sensing mechanisms. The design of such a sensor
is challenging because no clear notion is available for (1) controlling
the efficiency and stability of the excimer and (2) inculcating two
different working mechanisms in the detection of distinct classes
of analytes. Figure 1A illustrates the structural aspects of pyrene-linked amphiphile 1. At the polar domain of the molecule, the 3-aminopropane-1,2-diol
moiety was introduced. Beyond their contribution to the solvent-dependent
self-assembly process, the vicinal hydroxyl and amino groups were
also envisaged to play a significant role in metal-ion recognition.34 Two hydrophobic decyl chains were introduced
as self-adjustive tails to favor aggregation in the polar solvent
(e.g., H2O) environment (Figure 1B). In the milieu of these consummate partners,
a pyrene moiety was tethered as the signaling domain for either intermolecular
aggregation-induced emission enhancement or the sensing process.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of the Amphiphilic Pyrene Derivative
Synthesis
of compound 1 was carried out from (R)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-carbaldehyde (2) following
the aldehyde–amine–aldehyde three-component coupling
(A3-coupling)35 protocol established
by us.36,37 Aldehyde 2 upon reaction with
didecylamine 3 and pyrene alkyne 4 under
CuBr catalytic conditions provided compound 5 in 70%
yield. This product upon deprotection of the ketal group gave the
desired compound, 1, in 87% yield (Scheme 1). The structure of the product was confirmed
by NMR spectroscopy (see Figures S1–S4), crystallography (Figure S5), and mass
spectrometry (Figure S19).

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Compound 1
Excimer Formation
Amphiphile 1 was soluble
in a range of organic solvents (e.g., heptane, toluene, CHCl3, THF, CH3CN, MeOH, EtOH, and dimethyl sulfoxide), and
from a compatibility point of view, we selected EtOH as the solvent
for the aggregation studies. The UV–visible and fluorescence
spectra in EtOH suggested the existence of 1 exclusively
in the monomeric form (Figures S6 and S7). Upon gradual addition of H2O, the absorption and emission
characteristics of 1 remained unaffected up to the water
percentage fw ≤ 50% (Figures 2A and S8A). At fw ≥ 60%, bathochromic
shifts of the absorption bands to 333, 350, and 370 nm were observed,
indicating the onset of aggregation of compound 1 through
strong π–π stacking interactions between pyrene
moieties. Indeed, the respective fluorescence spectra of 1 in EtOH/H2O (fw ≥
60%) showed the appearance of an intense band at 498 nm, typical of
pyrene excimer emission (Figure 2A). Cuvette images (under the handheld UV lamp, with
λex = 365 nm) of freshly prepared samples of 1 also indicated strong cyan excimer emission when the solvent
polarity was increased to fw ≥
50% (inset of Figures 2B and S8B).

(A) and quantum yield values (B) of 1 in EtOH/H2O (fw =
0–90%). Inset: cuvette images of 1 in EtOH and
EtOH/H2O (fw = 60%).

Stepwise addition of EtOH (100–700
μL) to 1 (33.3 μM, 2 mL) prepared in EtOH/H2O (fw = 60%) resulted in a decrease
of the excimer intensity
and enhancement of monomer signals (Figure S9A). The monomer–excimer structural change was reversible, as
indicated by the images of samples captured after the sequential addition
of EtOH and H2O to the excimer of 1 (Figure S9B). This study confirmed that the formation
of an excimer is a solvent-polarity-dependent feature of 1. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies of 1 also confirmed
weak aggregation in EtOH (diameter < 10 nm), and the size of the
aggregated materials increased to a diameter of 400–800 nm
in EtOH/H2O (fw = 60%) (Figure S10). Subsequent increase in the fw resulted in the disintegration of the self-assembly,
which is possibly due to the increase in solvent polarity. To analyze
the effect of solvent polarity on the emission of the aggregated material,
quantum yield, Φ, values at different fw’s were recorded. This data also provided low Φ
= 0.01–0.04 (standard: quinine sulfate in 0.5 M H2SO4)38 in the polarity range fw = 0–50% (Figure 2B). An abrupt increase in Φ from 0.04
to 0.32 was observed with an increase in the H2O percentage
from fw = 50 to 60%. However, a further
increase in fw resulted in a slow decrease
of Φ until fw = 80% and a subsequent
rapid decrease to Φ = 0.2 at fw =
90%. Note that the freshly prepared so-called static excimer39 of 1 exhibited an excellent excimer-to-monomer
intensity ratio, Fexc/Fmono > 20, and was stable for more than 1 month (retention
of 20% of the initial excimer emission and optically detectable) under
ambient conditions (Figure S11). The excimer
was also stable at pH = 6–12 (Figure S12). The excimer stability in the long pH range endowed us to explore
the chemosensing applications of excimer 1 at physiological
pH. On the basis of these intriguing results, the chelating ability
of the free vicinal hydroxyl and amino groups with metal ions were
evaluated to explore the application of 1 as a metal-ion
sensor. On the other hand, the π–π stacking ability
of pyrene with electron-deficient aromatic systems was exploited through
the sensing of nitroaromatic explosives.

Detection of Metal Ions
The metal-ion sensing abilities
of excimer 1 (33.3 μM) were investigated in EtOH/H2O (fw = 60%) by screening Na+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, and
Fe3+ (70 μM each). Upon the addition of each cation,
the observed quenching efficiencies were significantly lower for Na+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Cr3+, and Fe3+ (Figures 3A and S15). The addition of Fe3+ to the
excimer of 1 yielded a maximum of 45% excimer fluorescence
quenching. Interestingly, the addition of
Cu2+ resulted in an excellent reduction in excimer fluorescence
by up to 94%. To further strengthen the selectivity of Cu2+-ion sensing, we have tested a bi-analyte system upon sequential
addition of Zn2+ and Cu2+ ions. Indeed, our
probe exhibited a remarkable selectivity toward the Cu2+ ion (Figure S16).

addition of various metal ions (70 μM)
in EtOH/H2O (fw = 60%) (A).
Inset: cuvette images of 1 in the absence and presence
of Cu2+ ions. Job’s plot analysis of 1 for the interaction with Cu2+ (B).

Titration of the excimer (33.3 μM) with Cu2+ ions
(0–70 μM) yielded a stepwise decrease in the excimer
band at 498 nm, with a concomitant enhancement of signals at 387 and
405 nm and an isosbestic point at 425 nm, indicating that only one
product was generated from 1 upon binding to Cu2+ ions (Figure S17). This study established
the application of 1 as a ratiometric chemosensor40−42 for Cu2+ ions. Quenching of the excimer and appearance
of blue fluorescence were also evident from the cuvette images captured
before and after the addition of Cu2+ ions (70 μM)
to 1 (33.3 μM, fw =
60% in EtOH) (Figure 3B, inset). A typical Job’s analysis (Figure 3B) of the fluorometric titrations data (Figure S18) was done to determine the stoichiometry
of the binding of Cu2+ ions with ligand 1.
The stoichiometric ratio for Cu2+–1 was estimated to be 1:2, which is very much consistent with earlier
reports on the fluorescence quenching of pyrene-based ligands (either
N-donor or O-donor) upon complexation with ions.43,44 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization tandem time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis of the mixture containing 1 and Cu(NO3)2·3H2O
also provided the signals corresponding to the 1:2 complexation45 (Figure S19). UV–visible
data obtained after the addition of Cu2+ ions strongly
indicated that the pyrene moieties were in the aggregated state (Figure S14), which was further supported by DLS
data (Figure S32A). This study confirmed
a predominant ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) process for Cu2+-ion sensing by quenching of the excimer emission.46

We further examined the quantitative response
of excimer 1 toward Cu2+ by fluorometric titrations.
A stepwise
decrease in the excimer fluorescence band (λex =
498 nm) was observed (Figure S17) when
titrations were carried out by the addition of increasing concentrations
of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (0–70
μM) to probe 1 (33 μM, fw = 60% in EtOH). When the fluorescence intensities at
498 nm were plotted against the concentrations of Cu2+,
an excellent linear correlation was observed up to 8 μM (regression
factor, R2 = 0.9959). A detection limit
of 0.394 μM was calculated for probe 1 during the
detection of Cu2+, on the basis of the signal-to-noise
ratio, S/N = 3 (Figure S20).

Among
various transition-metal ions, copper is the third most abundant
in the human body and plays a significant role in diverse physiological
processes.47 Therefore, sensitive and reliable
detection of copper41,42,48,49 in environmental50 samples and inside living cells is needed. Cell-imaging studies
were carried out to demonstrate the Cu2+-ion-sensing ability
of 1 in the biological system. In the study using the
HeLa cell line, strong cyan excimer fluorescence was observed when
HeLa cells were incubated with only 1 (15 μM, 10%
ethanol, pH = 7.4) at 37 °C for 45 min (Figure 4A). However, further treatment of these preincubated
cells with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (10
μM) at 37 °C for 1 min resulted in quenching of the cyan
fluorescence (Figure 4B). These experiments strongly demonstrate the cell-membrane permeability
of amphiphile 1, its stable aggregation in the intracellular
environment, and its ability to sense intracellular Cu2+ ions.

incubation with 1 (15 μM) for 45 min and (B) upon
incubation with 1, followed by treatment with Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (10 μM) for 1 min.

Detection of Nitroaromatic
Explosives
For the second
application, typical aromatic (e.g., 1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB),
2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol
(TNP)) and nonaromatic nitro explosives (e.g., nitromethane (NM) and
1,3,5-trinitroperhydro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX)) were used. In each experiment,
the response of 1 (33.3 μM, fw = 60% in EtOH) toward an analyte (0–39.6 μM)
was evaluated by recording the fluorescence spectrum (λex = 343 nm) immediately after mixing (Figures S22–S30). Among the tested aromatic explosives,
TNP displayed an excellent reduction of excimer fluorescence up to
98% (Figure 5A), with
a concomitant increase in monomer bands (Figure S22). The cyan-to-blue fluorescence change upon addition of
TNP (62.5 μM) to 1 (33.3 μM, fw = 60% in EtOH) was also confirmed optically from the
corresponding cuvette images (Figure 5A, inset). Quenching of excimer fluorescence by TNP
under the competing environment of other analytes established the
selectivity of 1 toward this nitro explosive (Figure 5B). We attribute
the excellent TNP selectivity of the excimer to the charge-transfer
(CT) complex51−53 formation between electron-rich pyrene and electron-deficient
TNP (evident from the pronounced CT band in Figure S21) through complementary intermolecular π-stacking
interactions. However, the contribution from the resonance energy
transfer process54−56 could not be ignored (evident from the spectral overlap
between the absorption of an analyte and emission of 1, Figure S31). These π-stacking
interactions further enhanced the aggregation behavior of 1, which was supported by the DLS measurement after the addition of
TNP (Figure S32B).

λex = 343 nm) of 1 (33.3 μM) in
EtOH/H2O (fw = 60%) upon addition
of different nitro explosives. Inset: cuvette
images of 1 in the absence and presence of TNP (A). Normalized
fluorescence intensity upon the addition of different nitro
explosives (20 μL of the 1 mM analyte during each addition)
followed by TNP (20 μL of the 1 mM analyte during each addition)
to 1 (B).

We further examined the quantitative response of probe 1 toward TNP by fluorometric titrations. A stepwise decrease
in the
fluorescence (λex = 498 nm) of the excimer band was
observed (Figure S22) when the titrations
were carried out by the addition of increasing concentrations of TNP
(0–39.6 μM) to probe 1 (33 μM, fw = 60% in EtOH). When the fluorescence intensities
at 498 nm were plotted against the concentrations of TNP, an excellent
linear correlation (regression factor, R2 = 0.95534) was observed. A detection limit of 155 nM was calculated
for probe 1 during the detection of TNP, on the basis
of a signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 3 (Figure S33). Notably, the sensing of nitro explosives has been a matter of
growing interest in the recent past. These sensors include dispersions
of relatively expensive metal-organic frameworks,55,57,58 as well as quantum dots,59−61 although most
of the experiments were performed in nonaqueous solvents and few in
aqueous solvents.23,62−64 However, the
use of the inexpensive pyrene derivatives for the sensing of nitroaromatics
in aqueous media appears closer to practical applications.

Mechanisms
of Sensing
On the basis of the above studies,
mechanisms for Cu2+ ion and TNP-sensing applications of 1 were proposed (Figure 6). The observed selectivity for Cu2+ was
attributed to complex formation, involving the hydroxyl oxygen and
amino nitrogen atoms coordinating with the soft Cu2+ ion
(Figure 6, path A).43,44 Sensing of TNP, on the other hand, was correlated to the intercalation
of the nitroaromatic compounds between pyrenes (i.e., π–π
stacking interactions), leading to a CT process from pyrene to the
analyte (Figure 6,
path B).

by the excimer of 1.

Conclusions
In summary, a simple and smart amphiphilic
pyrene compound was
developed for strong and stable excimer formation in aqueous media.
Sensing applications of the excimer in the aqueous media were demonstrated
in the present work through detections of metal ions and nitro explosives.
The suitably decorated pyrene derivative (with a polar vicinal diol
moiety and hydrophobic alkyl chains) displayed blue fluorescence in
EtOH, which switched to strong cyan fluorescence (excimer) upon increasing
the H2O percentage. In 40:60 EtOH/H2O, the aggregation
resulted in particles of size 400–800 nm, and a significant
amount of the excimer was retained even after 1 month. During the
screening of metal ions, the amphiphile displayed selectivity toward
Cu2+ ions, as evident from the quenching of the cyan excimer
fluorescence and appearance of the LMCT band in the absorption spectrum.
A chelation model involving the hydroxyl and amino groups of two molecules
of the amphiphile was also established. Imaging of intracellular Cu2+ ions by the excimer demonstrated the applicability of the
amphiphile in biological systems. The aggregate also exhibited a better
TNP-sensing ability when compared to that of other nitro explosives.
Almost complete quenching of the excimer fluorescence, observed during
TNP sensing, was associated with an effective CT process (from electron-rich
pyrene to electron-deficient TNP) through complementary intermolecular
π-stacking interactions. Our synthetic approach of combining
a polar head, nonpolar tails, and a responsive moiety in a single
entity could provide a platform for generating self-assembled multifunctional
molecule-based materials.

Experimental Section
Materials
All
chemicals for the synthesis were purchased
from commercial sources and used as received, unless stated otherwise.
All reactions were conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solvents,
petroleum ether, ethyl acetate (EtOAc), dichloromethane, and methanol
(MeOH), were distilled prior to thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and
column chromatography. Column chromatographic purifications were performed
on Merck silica gel (100–200 mesh). TLC was carried out with
E. Merck silica gel 60-F-254 plates. The analytes, 1,3-DNB, 2,4-DNT,
2,6-DNT, 4-NP, 2,4-DNP, TNP, and NM, were purchased from commercial
sources. TNT and RDX were collected from the High Energy Materials
Research Laboratory, Pune.

Methods
1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on either a 400 MHz Jeol ECS-400 (or 100 MHz for 13C) or 400 MHz Bruker AV400 (or 100 MHz for 13C)
spectrometer using either residual solvent signals as an internal
reference or internal tetramethylsilane on the δ scale (CDCl3: δH, 7.24 ppm, δC 77.0
ppm). The following abbreviations are used to describe peak patterns
where appropriate: b, broad; s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q,
quartet; m, multiplet. Coupling constants are reported in hertz (Hz).
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded either on an electron
spray ionization (ESI)-TOF or on a MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer.
Melting points were measured with a micro melting point apparatus.
Photophysical studies were conducted on UV–visible and steady-state
spectrophotometers. DLS studies were performed using a Nano ZS-90
apparatus utilizing a 633 nm red laser (at 90° angle) from Malvern
Instruments. At 90°, scattered fluctuations were detected to
generate correlation function [g2(t)]; from this function, the diffusion coefficient (D) was calculated using the cumulant method. By applying the Stokes–Einstein
equation, the particle diameter was calculated. The reproducibility
of the data was checked at least three times using independent solutions
of 1.
