Magnesium oxide (MgO)-engineered
barriers used in subsurface applications
will be exposed to high concentration brine environments and may form
stable intermediate phases that can alter the effectiveness of the
barrier. To explore the formation of these secondary intermediate
phases, MgO was aged in water and three different brine solutions
and characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 1H magic
angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
After aging, there is ∼4% molar equivalent of a hydrogen-containing
species formed. The 1H MAS NMR spectra resolved multiple
minor phases not visible in XRD, indicating that diverse disordered
proton-containing environments are present in addition to crystalline
Mg(OH)2 brucite. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations
for the proposed Mg–O–H-, Mg–Cl–O–H-,
and Na–O–H-containing phases were performed to index
resonances observed in the experimental 1H MAS NMR spectra.
Although the intermediate crystal structures exhibited overlapping 1H NMR resonances in the spectra, Mg–O–H intermediates
were attributed to the growth of resonances in the δ +1.0 to
0.0 ppm region, and Mg–Cl–O–H structures produced
the increasing contributions of the δ = +2.5 to 5.0 ppm resonances
in the chloride-containing brines. Overall, 1H NMR analysis
of aged MgO indicates the formation of a wide range of possible intermediate
structures that cannot be observed or resolved in the XRD analysis.

1 Introduction
Hydration
processes of MgO and dehydration of Mg(OH)2 have been extensively
investigated because of the wide application
of MgO phases as refractories,1 catalysts,2 and cements.3 In addition,
MgO has been approved for use as an engineered barrier for carbon
remediation at the DOE waste isolation pilot plant (WIPP) located
near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which is currently the only repository
for transuranic waste in the United States.4,5 This
has resulted in an increased interest in MgO hydration, particularly
when these materials are in contact with aggressive subsurface brine
environments. MgO was selected primarily to consume CO2 gas byproducts generated from degradation of organic materials in
waste packages.6 In its application as
a carbon remediator at the WIPP facility, the MgO barrier will be
exposed to a high-salt aqueous environment as WIPP is located inside
the geological Salado Salt Formation. How MgO converts to Mg(OH)2 in the presence of high concentration brines, and the presence
and stability of any intermediate phases, is critical to describing
the effectiveness of the engineered barrier.

Generally, the
conversion of MgO to Mg(OH)2 is expected
to occur in distinct steps, based on the dissolution and precipitation
of MgO particles.7 Amaral et al. described
a four-step process for hydration of MgO resulting in direct conversion
of MgO to Mg(OH)21        

In addition,
lamellar intermediate hydration phases have been identified
through Mg(OH)2 dehydration experiments and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) characterization.8 The stability of these different proposed phases was investigated
through density functional theory (DFT) simulations,9 which indicated that a solid solution of oxyhydroxide intermediates
with a Mgx+yOx(OH)2y composition may
exist between MgO and Mg(OH)2. Therefore, it is expected
that some secondary phases will form during aqueous aging of MgO because
of incomplete hydration processes.

The identification of these
intermediate phases becomes increasingly
complicated when complex solution chemistries are present. Previous
work on the impact of several salts (CaCl2, KOH, MgCl2, and MgSO4) on the hydration process found that
both the kinetics and thermodynamics of the hydration reaction were
altered.1 For example, the Mg2+ cations accelerated hydration, whereas Cl– anions
hindered it.1 Interestingly, this effect
was only seen at high salt concentrations (∼10 wt %), a condition
consistent with the high-salt-content brines present at WIPP.10 Long-term carbonation and aging studies of MgO
have been performed for evaluation of MgO for use at WIPP. These studies
used solutions that approximated the brines present at the WIPP facility
location and included generic weep brine (GWB) and ERDA-6 brine.6 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis identified the
formation of Mg(OH)2 (brucite), CaCO3 (calcite),
Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2 (hydromagnesite),
NaCl (halite), MgCl2(H2O)x (magnesium chloride hydroxide hydrate), Mg(HCO3)OH·2H2O (nesquehonite), and CaSO4 (anhydrite)
during brine + MgO + CO2 interactions over many years.

In addition to these reported crystal structures, there has been
research on the identification of Phase 3 (3Mg(OH)2·MgCl2·8H2O) and Phase 5 (5Mg(OH)2·MgCl2·8H2O) magnesium chloride hydroxide hydrates,
termed for the ratio of OH/Cl, in hydrated MgO. The Phase 3 species
has long-standing geological interest as a proposed pH buffer in saline
environments since the 1970s.11 More recently,
evaluation of the solubility constant of the Phase 5 species has suggested
that it is stable in GWB solutions and therefore is likely to be present
in aged MgO engineered barriers.5 Additionally,
in engineered materials, Phase 3 and Phase 5 both have been observed
to impact the properties of Sorel cement.3,12 Therefore,
a detailed understanding of how MgO reacts with brine solutions, and
what hydroxylated and hydrated phases are produced in those interactions,
is valuable in both geological and engineered material fields.

In addition to the crystalline structures discussed above, intermediate
phases or structures formed during hydration may be highly disordered
and present in relatively small concentrations, making identification
of all secondary phases by common diffraction-based techniques challenging.
Here, we demonstrate the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
as a tool to explore these hydrated intermediate MgO phases. NMR has
proven to be a powerful tool in the study of disordered phases in
the solid state,13 including ceramics,
oxides, glasses, and polymers. As NMR is nucleus specific (e.g., 1H, 7Li, 17O, 29Si, and so
forth), the local atomic structures can be directly probed and the
technique does not depend on the retention of a periodic ordered structure.
Recent advances in using first-principle computational methods14−16 to predict NMR parameters for different structural models (including
disordered and amorphous structures) have proven critical in the interpretation
of solid-state NMR results in disordered materials.

Solid-state 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR has been
used to determine low water concentrations in mantle silicates because
of the relatively high sensitivity of protons.17,18 NMR has also been successful in identifying different hydroxylated
and hydration phases in minerals, nominally anhydrous minerals, and
clays with studies including multinuclear NMR characterization of
montmorillonite19 and the identification
of MgnAl3–nOH (n = 1, 2 and 3) environments in layered
clays.20 The 1H MAS NMR results
for these systems demonstrated that the chemical shift is impacted
by both the strength of local hydrogen bonding and the nature and
ratio of the neighboring cations present in the material.

Combined
solid-state 1H, 17O, and 25Mg MAS
NMR methods have been used to characterize Mg-containing minerals
and phases, including wadsleyite (β-Mg2SiO4),21−23 ringwoodites (γ-Mg2SiO4),24,25 Mg acetates (Mg(CH3COO)2·nH2O),26 Mg-containing double hydroxides,27 and
hydrous magnesium silicates.2813C MAS NMR has been used to characterize magnesium carbonate minerals.291H MAS NMR studies on MgO have been
more limited but involve the identification of hydroxyls in solid
oxide catalysts30,31 and MgOH thermal decomposition32 or the formation of hydroxyls following water
adsorption on MgO surfaces.33,34 A more extensive study
combining 1H MAS NMR and DFT computations for hydroxylated
MgO surfaces has been reported2 and identified
three major proton environment types on the MgO surface, whereas the
DFT cluster calculations assisted in the assignment and spectral deconvolution
of the different (overlapping) OH-group resonances.

Despite
the extensive interest in MgO interactions with brine solutions,
unanswered questions on the possible formation of stable or semistable
magnesium oxychlorides during MgO hydration in brine conditions persist.
The identification of such phases provides insight into the stability
of the MgO engineered barrier and their effects on the transition
kinetics of MgO to Mg(OH)2. In this paper, we investigate
the formation of these intermediate phases by hydrating two different
MgO materials in three different high-salinity solutions to identify
what, if any, complex intermediate phases are being formed and stabilized.
Experimental 1H MAS NMR combined with DFT periodic calculations
are used to assist in separating and identifying multiple overlapping
proton-containing phases to take advantage of atomistic level insight
and provide guidance into the evolution of MgO intermediate structures.

2 Results and Discussion
The initial hydration of MgO
was evaluated in different solutions
including DI water and three salt solutions: GWB, Castile Brine (ERDA-6),
and 1 M NaCl (additional details in Supporting Information). The formation of intermediate phases during hydration
would be expected to depend on the starting characteristics of the
MgO material, particularly if significant differences in surface reactivity,
structure, or particle size exist. Even visually, the two starting
materials (WIPP-MgO and Marinco-MgO) appear very different (details
for the two MgO samples are given in the Materials
and Methods section). Marinco-MgO is a soft, white, fine-grained
powder, whereas WIPP-MgO is a gray or off-white powder with hard,
granular, large (∼1 mm) particles as seen in Figure 1. Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) also reveals marked differences in the particle shape and surface
structure. The Marinco-MgO particles appear to be composed of irregular,
plate-like structures (Figure 2a), which transform into a more featured surface following
aqueous aging in water or brine solutions (Figure 2b). In comparison, the WIPP-MgO contains
rounded, smooth surface particles (Figure 2c), which evolve into more plate-like phases
after aqueous exposure.

material) evaluated

(d) WIPP-MgO following aqueous aging. Aged samples were exposed to
1 M NaCl at 80 °C for 16 weeks.

Based on studies of MgO dissolution with controlled particle
sizes,
the particle dimensions are well known to impact diffusion rates.35−38 Therefore, we anticipate that the larger average particle size of
the WIPP samples are impacting the conversion rate of MgO to Mg(OH)2. The finer grains of the Marinco-MgO result in a larger surface
area/volume ratio, suggesting that there will be a higher initial
MgO to Mg(OH)2 conversion rate in these samples compared
to the WIPP-MgO. Generally, this work is focused on aging of MgO samples
in their as-received bulk state, where additional refining of the
material (controlling particle size or shape) was not performed. Therefore,
the tested MgO materials have a mixture of particles sizes and different
MgO surfaces present for reaction with the aqueous solutions. Previous
investigations have noted differences in dissolution rates on the
MgO(100), (110), and (111) surfaces.39 As
the water pressure increases, it is predicted that the (100) surface
becomes less stable, resulting in formation of hydroxylated (110)
and (111) surfaces at 300 K and 1 atm partial pressure of water, through
a Wulff plot construction.39 For a small
cubic particle, it is predicted that the controlled conversion of
the (100) to the (110) surface causes some passivating effects, decreasing
dissolution rate for particles with diameters between 10 nm to 1 μm.37 Both of the MgO materials used here have highly
disordered particle shape and sizes, and therefore are not expected
to form any passivating layers from complete transformation of the
(100) surface to (110) as might be expected for perfectly cubic samples.
The formation of the plate-like structures noted in Figure 2 is consistent with a variety
of published literature. SEM has identified thin nanosheets organized
as lamellar structures37 of “micro/nanoflowers”40,41 with microstructures comparable with the SEM results included here.

2.1 Identification of Intermediate Phases
Intermediate
phases formed during Mg(OH)2 dehydration
have been previously reported from TEM characterization of the surface
during dehydration.9 Other reports of MgO
hydration in brine solutions noted the development of a wide variety
of mineral phases from XRD but did not indicate if intermediate phases
were formed.6 Therefore, questions arise
concerning the presence of secondary or intermediate phases and their
relative concentration during MgO hydration. Typically, XRD has been
the most common method for identifying the formation of crystalline
intermediates,5,6 and here, XRD of the initial material
and the hydrolyzed MgO are presented in Figure 3. For both Marinco–MgO and WIPP-MgO,
the XRD reveals that the crystalline component contains primarily
MgO (periclase, 2θ = 36.9, 42.9). The Marinco-MgO also has some
concentration of slightly disordered Mg(OH)2 (brucite,
2θ = 18.6, 32.8, 38.0, 50.8, 57.9, 58.6). The sharp diffraction
observed near 2θ = 16.5° evident in some traces is an instrumental
sampling configuration artifact unrelated to MgO. The observation
of the Mg(OH)2 phase could represent a species initially
in the material or represent a hydrated phase possibly forming during
the long-time shelf storage of the material (∼15 years). Analysis
shows that 33 wt % of the crystalline phases in the starting Marinco-MgO
material is Mg(OH)2, whereas WIPP-MgO shows ∼100%
MgO phase.

Figure 3 XRD analysis comparing starting material (bottom, black traces)
for (a) Marinco-MgO and (b) WIPP-MgO with material aged in DI water
(middle, blue traces) or 1 M NaCl (red, top traces) at 80 °C
for 16 weeks. The (*) denotes an artifact from the sample holder.

After aqueous aging in DI water
for 16 weeks, the crystalline MgO
peaks in the XRD of Marinco-MgO (Figure 3a) disappear almost completely because of
either conversion of all MgO to the Mg(OH)2 hydroxide phase
or disordering of the initially crystalline MgO solid into very small
crystallites or a highly disordered amorphous phase for which scattering
does not occur. This disordering of the MgO phase is supported by
the 1H MAS NMR (see below) where the total proton molar
concentration of the hydrated phase is only a few percent with respect
to Mg. Conversely, the XRD of WIPP-MgO retains measurable (though
significantly reduced) crystalline MgO scattering intensity after
equivalent aging. This difference in behavior between the two MgO
starting materials is attributed to the initial physical properties
and surface structure of the samples (Figures 1 and 2), with the
hard, large grains of WIPP-MgO being less impacted during the short
hydration period (16 weeks) in comparison to Marinco-MgO. Following
aging in NaCl solutions, the XRD also reveals formation of a crystalline
NaCl phase in both MgO samples (Figure 3) with no other crystalline phases being detected in
the XRD.

Figure 4 shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of each MgO material following
aging at
80 °C in the different water and brine solutions. The most prominent
hydrogen-containing phases generated (δ = −0.3 to 0.8
ppm) are assigned to isolated MgOH proton environments that are not
strongly hydrogen bonded to nearby atoms; this is consistent with
Mg(OH)2 observed in the XRD (Figure 3). The 1H NMR also reveals resonances
between δ = +3.0 and +4.8 ppm consistent with different H2O hydration environments, whereas the resonances between δ
= +6.0 and +7.0 ppm result from the proton in either OH or H2O that is in hydrogen-bonded environments.42 Note that the 1H MAS NMR spectra resolve multiple proton-containing
phases that are not visible in XRD, including the 4–10 different
MgOH-type phases. Except for the MgO materials aged in the GWB brine,
these multiple MgOH phases are the dominant intermediate species produced
during aging (73–76% for DI, NaCl and ERDA-6). In the GWB-aged
materials, the MgOH phases constitute only ∼39 to 42% of the
total proton concentration. The proton-containing phases and relative
concentration resulting from aging in DI water and 1 M NaCl brine
are very similar, with the WIPP-MgO and Marinco-MgO materials giving
equivalent results except for the minor increase in sharpness (lower
disorder) of the NMR resonances in the Marinco-MgO samples. The Marinco-MgO
material from the DI and NaCl brine aging also had a minor increase
in the δ = +0.3 ppm environment concentration. For the ERDA-6
brine-aged materials, the WIPP-MgO has a higher concentration of the
OH environments (90%) in comparison to the aged Marinco-MgO (76%,
see Figure 4).

weeks in DI water of the different brine solutions. (a) WIPP-MgO.

and (d) DI-aged Marinco-MgO.

The complexity of the high number of different proton-containing
MgOH phases can be realized by analyzing the double quantum (DQ)-filtered 1H MAS spectra shown in Figure 5. In these types of filtered experiments, only resonances
that have significant 1H–1H dipolar coupling
will be retained. Increasing the length of the DQ excitation period
(Nr = number of rotor periods during excitation)
will also modulate the relative intensity and type of resonances observed.
For example, at Nr = 1, only proton environments
having the strongest dipolar coupling contribute to the signal and
produce the broad resonances that are hidden under the sharper resonances
in the Hahn echo spectra (Figure 5, top). As the dipolar coupling strength scales with
the 1H–1H distance as r–3, these broad resonances arise from environments
with smaller distances or higher number of 1H–1H contacts. With increasing Nr, 1H environments with slightly weaker dipolar coupling
begin to appear until the sharper resonances begin to dominate the
NMR spectra (Nr = 4, Figure 5, bottom). Spectral filtering
can also be obtained based on spin relaxation, including spin–spin
relaxation time (T2)-filtered experiments
(see Figure S3 in Supporting Information). In the T2-filtered experiments, the
broad resonances with short T2 values
are suppressed, whereas those proton environments with long T2 times are retained, producing spectra that
are dominated by the narrow resonances. These distinct types of filtering
experiments allow us to identify the multiple proton-containing phases
(∼15) present in the aged MgO materials and were used to fix
variables during the deconvolution process.

DI-aged Marinco-MgO sample as a function of the DQ excitation period, Nr. Multiple different 1H environments
are observed.

Additional details about
the multiple 1H environments
can be obtained by looking at the 2D DQ–SQ (single quantum) 1H MAS NMR correlation spectra as shown in Figure 6. In these 2D NMR experiments,
correlations (peaks) are observed for protons that are spatially near
each other and thus experience significant 1H–1H dipolar coupling. Peaks that are observed on the diagonal
(dashed line) are auto-correlation resonances and arise from equivalent 1H environments that are spatially near each other (solid circles
designate distinct 1H species). The resonances between
δ = +2 and −2 ppm are all MgOH-type environments with
the presence of auto-correlation peaks demonstrating that they interact
mainly with 1H that are in the same environment (same chemical
shift) and are in the same proton-containing phase. The exception
to this is the missing autocorrelation peak for the δ = −2.5
ppm resonance, which shows that this proton environment is not near
other protons, which is consistent with the assignment as an isolated
hydroxyl species based on the chemical shift range. Off-diagonal correlation
peaks (colored boxes) reveal 1H–1H dipolar
coupling between different proton environments (chemical shifts) and
are not very strong in the 2D DQ NMR experiments. There is some weak
correlation between select MgOH (δ = +2 to −2 ppm) and
H2O environments (δ +2.5 to 6 ppm) and would be consistent
with the different Mg(OH)2·nH2O phases discussed below. On the other hand, these 2D NMR
experiments reveal that the majority of MgOH produced exists in a
nonhydrated phase.

for aged
Marico-MgO at different DQ excitation periods a) Nr = 1 and b) Nr = 4. The multiple
auto-correlation peaks between protons in the same environment (chemical
shift) are identified by solid circles, the missing auto-correlation
peaks by the dashed circles, and the colored boxes identify regions
of weak correlation between different proton environments.

These resonance assignments are also supported
by previous 1H MAS NMR investigations of Chizallet et al.
on MgO surface
hydration, where DFT calculations were used to identify unique OH
sites on the MgO surface.2 They assigned
different 1H NMR chemical shift ranges based on the local
surface environments of the OH species and classified them into three
distinct domains: (i) the larger chemical shifts (+1.2 > δ
>
−0.7 ppm) were assigned to hydrogen bond donor OH groups, (ii)
hydrogen bond acceptor or isolated OH groups were assigned to the
more negative chemical shifts (<−0.7 ppm) and have been
related to catalytically active surface sites such as steps or corners,
and (iii) resonances near δ ≈ −0.7 ppm resulting
from OH species near kinks and divacancies in the MgO surface.31 Although their NMR spectra are similar to the
results reported here (Figure 4), it is important to note that the study utilized clean MgO
surfaces produced by high temperature treatment (>1023 K), thus
eliminating
the presence of carbonates, water, and excess hydroxyl concentrations.
Our MgO samples obtained after aqueous aging are expected to contain
both waters of hydration and possibly carbonate species sequestered
from the atmosphere.

Alternatively, the existence of Mg(OH)2-based intermediate
phases have been indicated by previous dehydration studies with a
series of compounds containing different hydroxide compositions and
packing densities proposed.8,9 As NMR is sensitive
to local atomic-level proton environments, we explored the possibility
of using DFT chemical shift calculations to separate or identify these
different (overlapping) OH-group resonances (δ = +2.0 to −2.2
ppm) observed in Figure 4. The 1H NMR chemical shifts and densities for seven different
Mg–O–H structures were calculated and are summarized
in Table 1. These intermediate
MgOH-type structures result from a proposed lamellar decomposition
path of Mg(OH)2 based on layer-by-layer dehydroxylate covering
20–80% hydroxide content.8,9 Crystal structures were
obtained from the crystallography open database (COD)43 and information on the creation of these different structure
models has been described previously.9 The
optimized, structurally relaxed structures are provided in the Supporting Information; the calculated 1H NMR chemical shifts (Table 1) range from δ = −0.18 to 0.78 ppm and reflect
a narrow range of local proton environments. The spectral overlap
in Figure 4, along
with the ±0.25 ppm error between the experimentally observed
NMR chemical and DFT-calculated chemical shifts (Sorte et al., unpublished),
make it difficult to specifically assign any of these intermediate
phases. The shielded proton environment experimentally observed at
δ = −2.2 ppm can be attributed to an isolated MgOH environment,2 whereas the δ = −0.05 ppm resonance
is consistent with a brucite MgOH-type speciation (δ = +0.05
ppm for pure brucite). Overall, it seems that any of the intermediate
phases identified in Table 1 are consistent with the observed NMR spectra; the clear growth
of 1H NMR chemical shifts between δ = 0 and +1 ppm
indicate that multiple OH phases are being produced that are not identified
by XRD alone.

2.2 Impact of Solution Composition
on Intermediate
Phase
Brine compositions introduce significant compositional
constituents that can also impact the type of intermediate phases
formed during hydration/hydroxylation of MgO. As previously discussed,
the existence of secondary phases, and in particular the Phase 3 and
Phase 5 Sorel cement phases, has been investigated separately for
thermodynamic stability when in contact with WIPP brines.5 We have used DFT to predict the 1H
NMR chemical shift for nine different Mg–Cl–O–H-containing
phases (optimized structures of these phases provided in Supporting Information) suggested by a variety
of different sources to address the impact of the Cl– anion on phase development. The MgCl2-containing phases
exhibited a 1H NMR chemical shift range between δ
= +2.6 to 4.9 ppm which is consistent with hydration water, with only
minor structural differences related to the number of coordinating
water. There does not appear to be any trend between the chemical
shift and the water content, except that the MgCl2·6H2O structure contains some water environments that are not
as strongly hydrogen-bonded. The perchlorate structures (Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O) also
predicted 1H NMR chemical shift values between +3.0 and
+4.3 ppm, which is consistent with the assignment as hydration H2O environments. Phase 3 and Phase 5 are the most interesting
because they contain both OH and H2O speciation and exhibit
a wide range of chemical shifts (Table 2). Phase 3 is predicted to have multiple 1H NMR chemical shift ranges with the MgOH environments being observed
between −0.13 and +0.26 ppm, hydration H2O environments
between +3.5 and 4.3 ppm, hydrogen-bounded H2O environments
between +5.8 and +6.4 ppm, and a very strongly hydrogen-bonded proton
species at +11.6 ppm. Most of these predicted chemical shifts are
consistent with those observed in the experimental NMR (Figures 4–6). Identification of Phase 3 might be obtained from 1H
MAS NMR, if distinct correlations between these different environments
could be established using 2D 1H NMR. The identification
of unique hydration and hydroxylation phases has been demonstrated
through extensive analysis of SQ and DQ 1H MAS NMR spectra
for hydrous ringwoodite (γ-Mg2SiO4).24 The complexity of the spectra demonstrated in Figures 5 and 6 suggests that for these aged MgO samples, this type of extensive
identification would be difficult from the 1H NMR data
alone. An exception is the δ +11.5 ppm resonance produced by
a H2O proton coordinating a Cl– anion
with a nearest-neighbor distance of <2.0 Å, an environment
not seen in other Mg–Cl–O–H-containing compounds.
This resonance is observed in some of the aged samples (Figure 4) but with very low concentration
(intensity), suggesting that it is a very minor phase. It is not expected
that sufficient quantity would be present for identification by SEM
analysis. Similarly, Phase 5 exhibits predicted 1H NMR
chemical shifts that range from the highly shielded OH at δ
= −2.3 ppm, OH environments between +0.6 and 1.9 ppm, hydration
H2O environments between δ = +4.7 and +5.0 ppm, and
hydrogen-bonded H2O species at +8.2 ppm. Chemical shifts
in the 0 to +2.0 ppm region are experimentally observed for MgO samples
aged in DI water only (Figure 4), where there is no excess of Cl– in solution
that could lead to the formation of Phase 5. The unique chemical shift
of Phase 5 is the −2.28 ppm 1H NMR chemical shift,
which is indicative of a very isolated OH molecule and, again, is
present in these materials but in a very minor concentration and may
be difficult to identify by other less sensitive characterization
techniques.

Presence of the Na+ cation
in the brine solutions also
prompted DFT chemical shift predictions for select hydrated NaOH crystal
structures (Supporting Information) as
summarized in Table 3. These six NaOH crystal phases which contained water molecules,
all predict 1H NMR chemical shifts in the range of +6.0
to +7.0 ppm, which do appear (though not well resolved) in the experimental
spectra of NaCl, GWB, and ERAD6 (Figure 4, especially the deconvolution in Figure 4c). This would support
the argument that NaOH-type phases may exist in these aged MgO samples,
but it would be difficult to confirm this by 1H NMR alone.
The inclusion of additional heteronuclear experiments (17O, 23Na, and 25Mg) would provide additional
details but were not pursued in the current study because of the low
overall concentration of these new amorphous phases. Selective filtering
based on 1H–17O, 1H–23Na, or 1H–25Mg cross-polarization
techniques would prove beneficial for future studies.

2.3 Concentration of Hydrogen-Containing
Phases
It was possible to follow the evolution of the proton-containing
intermediate phases as a function of exposure time to the different
solutions. An example of this for both WIPP-MgO and Marinco-MgO is
shown in Figure 7 for
the DI water-aged samples and in Figure 8 for the NaCl salt solution-aged samples.
After the initial 2 weeks of aging where most of the final proton-containing
phases are already observed, there is only a minor variation in the
relative concentration of the different phases. Similar trends were
observed for the GWB- and ERDA6-aged Mg samples (Supporting Information). From the integration of these NMR
spectra, it is possible to determine the total proton concentration
(Figure 9) as a means
of quantifying the extent to which MgO has been converted to hydrated
or hydroxyl phases. For the sets of samples aged either at 20 °C
or at 80 °C, the majority of hydrogen-containing phase formation
occurred in the first four weeks, with less significant changes in
proton concentration occurring in the subsequent aging time. Of course,
16 weeks is a brief time period on geological time scales, but these
initial formed phases represent the most reactive MgO sites available
for hydration and hydroxide formation. These results show that the
hydrogen concentration is ∼4% of the original MgO concentration.
Marinco-MgO exhibits a consistently higher hydrogen concentration
than WIPP-MgO, with the highest hydrogen concentration occurring for
the DI-aged samples, followed by NaCl, GWB, and ERDA6 brine solutions.
Although proton density for Marinco-MgO indicates that there is only
∼4% hydrogen equivalent in this phase, XRD revealed that nearly
all of the MgO crystallinity has been lost. It is hypothesized that
the disappearance of the MgO scattering arises primarily from disordering
within the MgO phase and not complete conversion to Mg(OH)2. Generally, this supports the existence of MgO-containing disordered
phases, particularly when MgO has a high surface area available for
hydration.

(a) Samples aged at 80 °C. (b) Samples aged at 20 °C.

Overall, the measured proton concentrations
are relatively low,
with only a maximum of 0.04 mol of protons per mole of MgO observed
at 16 weeks. If one assumes that only hydroxyl and hydration waters
are present (limiting value), then the overall composition of the
sample is estimated as MgO·[Mg(OH)2]x·(H2O)y, where
(2x + 2y) is equal to the total
relative proton concentration with respect to MgO (i.e., ∼0.04
from Figure 9). Using
the relative fraction of OH to the total number of protons (∼0.75)
for the aged samples, this corresponds to a MgO·[Mg(OH)2]0.005·(H2O)0.015 average overall
composition. You can also think of the phase created in terms of the
average composition of just the hydrated phase, which is given by
the ratio of the hydroxyl and water protons, as approximately Mg(OH)2·(H2O)3. This approximation of
the proton-containing hydrated phase does not consider any phases
containing carbonate or other cations/anions that may have formed,
where the impact of these different constituents would require additional
methods to determine the existence, concentration, and composition
of the additional speciation. The 1H NMR chemical shifts
for a range of carbonate phases have been calculated (Sorte et al.,
unpublished) and are consistent with the 1H NMR chemical
shifts observed here. These carbonate chemical shifts are not included
in the current discussion because of the inability to prove the formation
of carbonate phases in the aged MgO, especially at these low amorphous
phase concentrations but will be the target of future efforts.

3 Conclusions
As a carbon remediator at the WIPP facility,
the MgO engineered
barrier will be exposed to a high-salt aqueous environment and may
form stable intermediate phases that can alter the effectiveness of
the barrier. Here, two different MgO materials (WIPP-MgO and Marinco-MgO)
were aged in water and brine solutions (NaCl, GWB, and ERDA6) for
up to 16 weeks, with XRD and NMR analysis performed to identify changes
in the structure and the possible formation of secondary phases. After
aging, there is the formation of ∼4% molar equivalent of a
hydrogen-containing phase. The concentration and formation rate for
this hydrogen-containing phase is a function of the initial MgO particle
structure, with the fine-grained Marinco-MgO powders resulting in
more extensive loss of crystallinity and a higher proton-containing
phase concentration than the harder, larger particle size of WIPP-MgO
(Figure 1). 1H MAS NMR spectra can resolve low concentration of the minor phases
not visible in XRD and has revealed a diverse set of 1H
NMR environments. DFT simulations for twenty-one proposed Mg–O–H-,
Mg–Cl–O–H-, and Na–O–H-containing
phases were performed to index the different resonances which appear
in the experimental 1H MAS NMR spectra. Although the different
proposed crystal structures exhibited overlapping 1H NMR
resonances, Mg–OH intermediates were attributed to the growth
of resonances in the δ = +1.0 to 0 ppm range, whereas the proposed
Mg–Cl–OH structures most likely contributed to the δ
= +2.5 to 5.0 ppm peak in the chloride-containing brines (Figure 4). Overall, NMR analysis
of aged MgO indicates the formation of a range of possible intermediate
structures that cannot be resolved with XRD analysis alone. Further
documentation of secondary phases will require additional characterization
based not just on protons but also other nuclei such as 23Na, 25Mg, or 17O NMR for separation of overlapping
resonances and identification of nonproton-containing phases (e.g.,
calcite, halite, anhydrite).

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Hydrated MgO Materials
It should
be noted that the MgO materials from different manufacturers have
significant variation in appearance, particle size, and color. We
therefore investigated two different unaged MgO materials. The first
was MagChem 10 WTS-60 obtained from Martin Marietta Specialties (Baltimore,
MD), which is a hard-burned MgO produced from magnesium-rich brine
and dolomitic lime, giving low reactivity and coarse particle size
material. This sample was equivalent to the material used in previous
WIPP facility studies52 and was designated
as WIPP-MgO. The other material is Marinco OL MgO (this material was
discontinued ∼2004) manufactured in a two-step process by Rohm
& Haas Company at their Manistee MI plant and was designated as
Marinco-MgO.53 Both MgO samples have a
purity of 98%, with 2% nominally comprising oxides of silicon, iron,
aluminum, and calcium.

Aqueous aging of the MgO materials was
carried out by immersing 200 mg of the sample in 500 mL of different
brine solutions or DI water. The salt solutions investigated included
GWB, castile brine (ERDA-6), and a 1 M NaCl solution. Recipes for
the synthetic Salado brines are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). Samples were sealed during exposure
but opened briefly for sample extraction every several weeks. No effort
was made to remove atmospheric CO2 from the aging test
chambers. Each MgO material was aged in the different solutions unagitated
at room temperature (25 °C) for up to 16 weeks exposure. Additional
samples were also prepared by aging at 80 °C in an agitated water
bath (oscillating at ∼1 Hz). Small sample aliquots were extracted
periodically by removing ∼20 mg of saturated MgO material from
the test chamber, then dried overnight (25 °C) under vacuum in
the presence of P2O5, before packing and sealing
in NMR MAS rotors.

4.2 Solid-State NMR
All solid state 1H MAS NMR spectra were obtained on a
Bruker AVANCE III spectrometer
at a proton observe frequency of 600.1 MHz using a 2.5 mm broadband
MAS probe spinning between 25 and 30 kHz. The nominal set temperature
was 295 K but because of frictional heating under MAS, the sample
temperature was 329 K (30 kHz). The sample temperature was calibrated
with the 207Pb chemical shift change of the secondary Pb(NO3)2 standard.54,551H spectra
were obtained using a rotor-synchronized Hahn echo with 2 s recycle
delays and 16 scan averages. The experimental 1H MAS NMR
chemical shifts were referenced to the secondary standard adamantane
(δ = +0.8 ppm) with respect to tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ
= 0 ppm). The NMR spectral deconvolutions were obtained using the
DMFIT software package.561H
concentrations in the aged MgO samples were obtained by direct comparison
of signal intensity to the intensity of a secondary external standard
of adamantane under the same experimental conditions. The 2D DQSQ 1H MAS correlation experiments and the DQ-filtered spectra
utilized the chemical shift and offset compensated back-to-back multiple
pulse sequence for excitation and reconversion of the multiple quantum
coherences.57 The 2D experiment used phase-sensitive
detection in the F1 dimension via the States time-proportional
phase incrementation method.

Powder XRD patterns were obtained
by placing 40–50 mg of each sample in a mortar and pestle,
adding acetone, and grinding the wetted powder. An aliquot of this
suspension was transferred onto a 25 mm diameter, off axis, zero background
quartz planchette to give an ∼1 mm thick sample. Diffraction
was obtained on a Siemens Kristalloflex D500 diffractometer, using
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA;
analysis was performed using MDI Jade v9.6 with ICDD PDF-4 2018.

4.3 Chemical Shift Calculations
The initial
Mg-containing crystal structures were imported from the COD.43 These structures were then relaxed using DFT
periodic calculations as implemented in the Quantum ESPRESSO open-source
electronic structure code.58 Norm-conserving
pseudopotentials,59 with the generalized
gradient approximation in the form of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof,60 were used. An energy cut-off of 90 Ry was used
with a 6 × 6 × 6 k-point matrix. High convergence
levels were used: total energy convergence threshold = 4.0 ×
10–8 Ry, force convergence threshold = 2.0 ×
10–5 Ry, and self-consistent energy threshold =
1.0 × 10–10 Ry. For initial identification
of low-energy crystal structures, the lattice parameters were changed
iteratively to identify the lowest energy structure, which was then
used as the starting point for a variable cell relaxation calculation.
Optimized structures are provided in Supporting Information.

Computational 1H NMR chemical
shifts were calculated using the gauge-including projector augmented-wave
(GIPAW) methods61 as implemented in Quantum
ESPRESSO with a cut off energy of 1225 eV. Readers are encouraged
to see a recent review62 for a more thorough
description of the GIPAW method and its application to oxide and ceramic
systems. GIPAW methods have already proven successful in calculating
proton NMR shielding in MgO phases.2,14,31 Generally, the GIPAW method is used for the calculation
of both electric field gradient and absolute shielding tensors (δcalc). The advantage of the GIPAW method is that it uses a
plane-wave basis set, which is suitable for simulation of infinite
periodic systems such as bulk solids. Previously, most NMR calculations
had been limited to quantum mechanical calculations, which used localized
atom-centered basis sets that are computationally expensive to extend
to bulk systems or surfaces. Plane-wave codes use an approximation,
called a pseudopotential, for the corevalence interactions of an atom
that freezes the core electrons in place and which simplifies the
calculation and reduces the computational cost. The projector augmented
wave (PAW) portion of the GIPAW method is used to reconstruct the
true all-electron wave function in the atomic core, so that the response
of the system to a uniform external magnetic field can be calculated.
The gauge-including (GI) portion refers to the fact that with a finite
basis set, the results may vary with the distance between the wave
function and the gauge origin, making results inconsistent depending
on where the origin is set (commonly the center of mass). Additionally,
the paramagnetic and diamagnetic terms of the magnetic field, calculated
through the current density, are both individually dependent on the
gauge origin. Therefore, by advancing the PAW methodology to include
gauge invariance, the accuracy and transferability of the methodology
was substantially improved for a wide variety of systems.

In
our simulations, the absolute chemical shielding tensors for
the computationally-relaxed crystalline systems were obtained from
fully converged all-electron calculations. The experimental (δexp) and calculated (δcalc) 1H
NMR chemical shifts are related to the isotropic component of the
chemical shielding tensor, σiso, using. 1  where σRef is the isotropic
component of the reference chemical shielding tensor. It has been
argued that the variation in the experimental chemical shift (or chemical
shielding) is proportional to the variation in the chemical shift
obtained from DFT calculations,63 2  

Experimentally,
the reference standard for 1H NMR is
TMS (tetramethylsilane), but in general σRefexp or σRefcalc are not required to be equivalent.
The proportionality between α and σRefcalc was determined by correlating
experimental chemical shifts to calculated chemical shieldings via. 3  where β
= ασrefcalc (see Supporting Information for additional details).
Using a series of Mg-containing mineral structures, including Mg(OH)2 (brucite), MgCl2·6H2O (bischofite),
MgSO4·7H2O (epsomite), and Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (nitromagentiste), the correlation
between the experimental chemical shift and calculated shielding tensor
it was found that α = 0.701 and that σRefcalc = 30.7 ppm (Sorte et al.,
unpublished results) and is shown in Figure S4 for completeness. This σRef is similar to the 30.8
ppm recently reported for uranyl hydroxide phases64 but is slightly higher than that reported for organic compounds.65 These results allowed a direct comparison between
the experimental and calculated chemical shifts using eq 1.
