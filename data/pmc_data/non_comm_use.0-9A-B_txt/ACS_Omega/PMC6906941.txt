Highly dispersed ZnO/g-C3N4 composites
with
different doping ratios of g-C3N4 were prepared
by a hydrothermal method. The preparation method is simple and the
energy consumption is low. The composite samples were used to degradate
the methyl orange solution. They all showed excellent photocatalytic
activity and cycling stability. The optimal loading content of g-C3N4 was investigated, and the mechanism of enhanced
photocatalytic activity was studied in detail. This study provides

1 Introduction
In recent years, with
the development of the economy and the popularization
of industrialization, the rapid improvement of human living standards
has exposed serious environmental pollution problems, exposing a serious
threat to human health and hindering the sustainable development of
society.1−3 A lot of researchers have made great efforts to explore
more catalysts or novel materials to degrade organic and toxic pollutants
of wastewater.4,5 Fortunately, energy shortage and
water pollution problems can be partially solved by semiconductor
photocatalysis technology, which has been the research focus recently.6−9 Some semiconductors such as ZnO,10 TiO2,11,12 and BaTiO313 have been used in the photocatalysis field.

ZnO is
a nontoxic, low-cost semiconductor that is abundant in the
earth’s crust. It is widely used in photocatalytic degradation
of organic dyes and photocatalytic decomposition of generating hydrogen
from water.14−16 However, there are still some problems with the ZnO
semiconductor that it can respond to most ultraviolet light and little
visible light. It recombined photogenerated electrons and holes easily
and had low quantum efficiency. To improve the photocatalytic performance
of ZnO and broaden the spectrum absorption in the visible range, researchers
found three ways such as designing Z-scheme,17 doping metal/nonmetal elements,18 and
coupling with other semiconductors.8

In 1993, Niu’s group published a paper on the g-C3N4 crystal with the hardness exceeding the diamond in
Science.19 Because of the dramatic result,
this graphite-like nitrogen carbide semiconductor has attracted more
attention.20−22 Researchers found the g-C3N4 catalytic degradation of organic dyes under visible light and decomposition
of hydrogen from water.23 At present, g-C3N4 composite materials are widely used in photocatalysis.
They also become one of the best photocatalytic materials due to their
low raw material prices.

Inspired by the above analysis, it
is a good strategy to construct
a ZnO/g-C3N4 composite structure to improve
the photocatalytic efficiency. Some methods for preparing ZnO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts have been reported
before;24−26 the composite photocatalyst exhibited higher degradation
activity of methyl orange than pure ZnO and g-C3N4 but still has the following problems: the first one is that the
preparation method is more complicated and the yield is lower; the
second one is that the energy consumption is large; the third one
is that the cycling stability is poor and it is difficult to reuse;
and the last one is that the mechanistic research of ZnO/g-C3N4 is rarely reported. To solve the above problems, we
synthesized the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite via a hydrothermal
method. This preparation method is simple, low cost, and the recycle
utilization has been improved. Besides, the effects of different g-C3N4 doping ratios on photocatalytic effects were
systematically studied and the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions
was analyzed in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of the ZnO/g-C3N4 Composite Photocatalyst
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of as-prepared samples are shown in Figure 1 to investigate the phase structures
of the samples. Figure 1a shows the typical diffraction patterns of pure ZnO, and all of
the diffraction peaks of the patterns are well consistent with the
wurtzite phase of ZnO (JCPDS: 36-1451). Figure 1b shows the typical diffraction patterns
of pure g-C3N4, the well-defined peak at 2θ
27.4° was indexed for graphic materials as the peak of g-C3N4 (002).27 Also, the
diffraction patterns of the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite
photocatalyst are shown in Figure 1c; all of the diffraction peaks of the patterns are
well consistent with Figure 1a,b, and the diffraction pattern illustrates that the sample
is a composite structure of ZnO and g-C3N4.

Figure 1 XRD patterns
of pure ZnO (a), pure g-C3N4 (b), and ZnO/g-C3N4 (c).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of
as-prepared samples
are shown in Figure 2, which are used for an in-depth study of the morphology of composite
materials. The TEM image of the prepared ZnO is shown in Figure 2a, and ZnO shows
a random arrangement. Figure 2b shows the TEM image of the prepared g-C3N4. Figure 2c
shows the TEM images of the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite
material. It can be seen that the morphologies of ZnO and g-C3N4 are rodlike and sheet, respectively. The diameter
of ZnO is about 300 nm, and two different phases combine each other
closely. This combination of ZnO and g-C3N4 would
extend the lifetime of photogenerated electrons and holes, which reduces
the internal charge recombination. This is very beneficial to the
improvement of photocatalytic activity, which will be confirmed in
the following work.

Figure 2 TEM images of pure ZnO (a), pure g-C3N4 (b),
and ZnO/g-C3N4 (c).

The UV–vis absorption spectra of pure ZnO,
pure g-C3N4, and ZnO/g-C3N4 are shown
in Figure 3 to compare
the light absorption capacity of different photocatalysts. As we know,
it has a close relationship with photocatalytic activity. It can be
seen that the ZnO sample displayed intrinsic absorption peaks in the
ultraviolet area, while g-C3N4 has absorption
peaks from the ultraviolet region to the visible range of about 460
nm, these are highly consistent with previous reports.28 ZnO/g-C3N4 showed two
distinct absorption peaks, which were located in the ultraviolet and
visible regions, respectively. The absorption peak in the ultraviolet
region is in accordance with the position of the intrinsic absorption
peak of ZnO, and the absorption peak in the visible region also matches
the absorption peak of g-C3N4. Compared with
pure ZnO, the wider light absorption region of ZnO/g-C3N4 can make full use of visible light, resulting in higher
photocatalytic activity.

of pure ZnO, pure
g-C3N4, and ZnO/g-C3N4.

2.2 Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic
activities of as-prepared samples were evaluated by the degradation
experiment of methyl orange under visible light. First, the optimal
g-C3N4 doping content of the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was explored. Figure 4a shows the photocatalytic
degradation activity of methyl orange by a pure ZnO catalyst, pure
g-C3N4 catalyst, and composite photocatalyst
with g-C3N4 contents of 10, 20, and 30% by weight,
respectively. As can be seen from Figure 4a, ZnO/g-C3N4-20 wt
% showed the highest photocatalytic activity.

Figure 4 Degradation curves of
different samples of methyl orange under
visible light irradiation (a) and cycle curve of the photocatalytic
degradation of methyl orange by ZnO/g-C3N4-20
wt % (b).

At the same time, in the actual application process,
the photocatalytic
effect of photocatalyst recycling is an important indicator. To determine
the recycling capacity of the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite
photocatalyst by five cycles of degradation experiments on methyl
orange. Figure 4b presents
that after five cycles of degradation experiments, the degradation
rate of methyl orange by the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite
photocatalyst did not decrease significantly. The degradation ability
could still reach more than 90%, indicating that the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst has good recyclability.

2.3 Photocatalytic Mechanism
The photoluminescence
spectra of pure ZnO, pure g-C3N4, and ZnO/g-C3N4 are shown in Figure 5 to investigate the migration, transfer,
and recombination of electron–hole pairs. As we know, the separation
efficiency of carriers can improve the photocatalytic performance
of photocatalysts.29−31 It can be seen from Figure 5 that the pure ZnO sample displays an intense
intrinsic fluorescence emission peak at around 380 nm, and at the
same time, the defect fluorescence emission peak of ZnO can be observed
between 600 and 650 nm.32 The pure g-C3N4 sample revealed an intense fluorescence emission
peak between 450 and 500 nm.33 Compared
with the above pure sample, ZnO/g-C3N4 shows
intrinsic fluorescence emission peaks of ZnO and g-C3N4 simultaneously and the strength was reduced. The lower photoluminescence
intensity meant that the high-efficiency electron transferred from
the conduction band of g-C3N4 to the conduction
band of ZnO, hindering the reorganization of photoinduced charge carriers.
The occurrence of this quenching phenomenon provided effective evidence
for the improvement of photocatalytic activity.34

Figure 5 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pure ZnO, pure g-C3N4, and ZnO/g-C3N4.

The photocurrent tests of pure ZnO and ZnO/g-C3N4 are indicated in Figure 6. As we know, the stronger the photocurrent
means the
more the photogenerated electrons, which implies that the electron–hole
separation is better, resulting in higher photocatalytic activity. Figure 6 shows the photocurrent–time
curves of g-C3N4, ZnO, and ZnO/g-C3N4 in the dark and visible light in the switching cycle
mode; obviously, the latter possesses higher corresponding photocurrent
strength, which undoubtedly proves its higher electron–hole
separation efficiency. This is consistent with the results obtained
in the above PL experiment, which further provides evidence for the
higher catalytic efficiency of the composite catalyst.

curves of pure ZnO, pure g-C3N4, and ZnO/g-C3N4.

A free radical trapping experiment was carried
out to investigate
the mechanism of degradation of methyl orange by ZnO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts as shown in Figure 7. It is an accepted effective
method for studying the photodegradation reaction pathway of organic
molecules.35−37 At present, there are three types of active substances
in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants, namely superoxide
radicals (•O2–), hydroxyl
radicals (•OH), and photogenerated holes (h+). A series of free radical trapping experiments were carried
out using isopropanol (IPA), benzoquinone (BQ), and TEOA over the
ZnO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalysts. This is
the quencher corresponding to the above three substances.38 The degradation results of methyl orange showed
that when IPA was added, the photodegradation efficiency of methyl
orange was only 19%; if BQ was used as the quencher, the photodegradation
efficiency of methyl orange was 24%; when TEOA was used as the quencher,
the degradation of methyl orange reached the highest efficiency, up
to 37%. The above results indicate that superoxide radicals (•O2–), hydroxyl radicals
(•OH), and photogenerated holes (h+)
are all active substances of photocatalytic degradation of methyl
orange and the order of influence of the activating substances in
the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange is •O2– > •OH >
h+.

Figure 7 Photodegradation rates of methyl orange by ZnO/g-C3N4 of different quenchers.

Figure 8 displays
the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange by ZnO/g-C3N4 composites. It is well known that the degradation
of methyl orange is mainly attributed to the production of three active
substances, namely superoxide radicals (•O2–), hydroxyl radicals (•OH),
and photogenerated holes (h+). ZnO itself cannot be excited
by visible light; it can only work in ultraviolet light. The band
gap of g-C3N4 is 2.7 eV, which can adsorb visible
light. The photocatalytic degradation mechanism of g-C3N4 was mainly attributed to two processes: one is the
reduction process initiated by photogenerated electrons, such as the
degradation of MO; another has originated from oxidation by the photogenerated
hole, such as the degradation of RhB.39 The spectrum of the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite can
be broadened to the visible region compared with the pure ZnO. Compared
with the pure g-C3N4, the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite has a significantly enhanced photocatalytic
effect for degrading methyl orange under visible light. This is attributed
to the observation that the conduction band (CB) edge potential of
g-C3N4 was more negative than that of ZnO, and
the photoinduced electrons on g-C3N4 particle
surfaces transferred to the CB of ZnO easily via combining closely.
g-C3N4 can be charged to restore to the ground
state by degrading methyl orange. At the same time, the electron–hole
separations were also driven by the synergistic effect of ZnO and
g-C3N4. This synergistic effect leads to large
numbers of electrons on the ZnO surface and large numbers of holes
on the g-C3N4 surface, respectively. These are
all factors that promote the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation
of methyl orange.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the ZnO/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst
with high dispersibility was successfully prepared. The photocatalyst
has a simple preparation method and high photocatalytic activity and
recycling stability. The optimal loading content of g-C3N4 was ZnO/g-C3N4-20 wt %. The synergistic
mechanism of ZnO and g-C3N4 was confirmed by
a series of experiments. This study provides the possibility of exploring
more photocatalysts.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Melamine (99.9%), ammonia
(25%), ZnO (>99.5%), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP), benzoquinone
(BQ),
triethanolamine (TEOA), and isopropanol (IPA) were all supported by
Shanghai Chemistry Co., Ltd. The above reagents are of analytical
grade and have not been further purified. Deionized water is obtained
from the analytical laboratory.

4.2 Synthesis of Samples
4.2.1 Synthesis of ZnO
To increase the
surface area of ZnO, commercial zinc oxide is treated with ammonia
water to obtain ZnO required for the experiment. The specific steps
are as follows: 5 g of zinc oxide was dispersed in 100 mL of deionized
water. To this, 10 mL of 25% ammonia was added dropwise and stirred
at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged to obtain a sample,
which was washed several times with deionized water and dried at 60
°C for 10 h.

4.2.2 Synthesis of g-C3N4
Pure g-C3N4 was synthesized by calcining
melamine at a high temperature. Briefly, 10 g of melamine was placed
in a crucible and nitrogen was passed through a tube furnace and heated
from room temperature to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min
for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature, the prepared g-C3N4 was ground into a powder and sonicated for 1 h.

4.2.3 Synthesis of ZnO/g-C3N4 Composites
ZnO/g-C3N4 composites
were synthesized according to the following procedure: 1 g of zinc
oxide was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. To this, a certain
amount of PVP was added, stirred, and heated to 60 °C. Then,
different amounts of g-C3N4 were added and the
mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 h. The mixture was transferred
into a stainless steel autoclave and kept warm at 140 °C for
8 h under vacuum. Then, the product was naturally cooled to room temperature
and centrifuged several times with deionized water and dried at 80
°C for 10 h.

4.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the photocatalyst were recorded at room temperature.
The patterns of the samples were acquired by a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffraction
system with high-intensity Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 200 mA) at
20–70° with a scanning step of 10° min–1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired on
a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were obtained
using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer by using BaSO4 as
a reference. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the photocatalyst
were performed at room temperature with 325 nm as the excitation wavelength
and a Xe lamp as the excitation source.

4.4 Photocatalytic Experiments
The photocatalytic
activities were evaluated through decomposing methyl orange under
visible light irradiation (a 500 W Xe lamp with a 400 nm cutoff filter).
For this, 0.05 g of photocatalyst was dispersed in 20 mL of methyl
orange solution with a concentration of 10–5 mol/L
under magnetic stirring for 30 min in the dark to achieve effective
adsorption between the photocatalyst and methyl orange. After starting
the irradiation, 5 mL was taken to monitor the absorbance of methyl
orange every 20 min. In addition, free radical capture experiments
were performed by adding 1 mmol benzoquinone (BQ), triethanolamine
(TEOA), and isopropanol (IPA), respectively.

4.5 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) Measurement
Before preparing the corresponding electrode, the following steps
were operated. About 0.5 g of as-prepared sample was dispersed in
4 mL of ethanol. The dispersed catalyst was dip-coated onto a 1 ×
1 cm2 fluorine-doped tin oxide glass electrode and then
dried by a hairdryer. The photoelectrochemical measurements were carried
out on normal three-electrodes with 0.5 M sodium sulfate solution
as the electrolyte. The as-prepared photocatalyst thin films were
used as the working electrodes, the counter electrode was platinum,
and the reference electrode was silver/silver chloride. The illumination
source is a 500 W Xe lamp, and the distance from the photoelectrode
was fixed to 20 cm. The photoelectrochemical measurements were performed
on a CHI-760D electrochemical analyzer from Shanghai ChenHua Instruments
Co., Ltd.
