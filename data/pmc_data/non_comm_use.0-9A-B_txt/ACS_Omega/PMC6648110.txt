Electroactive and biocompatible fibrous
scaffolds have been prepared
and characterized using polyaniline (PAni) doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic
acid (DBSA) combined with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PLA/poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) mixtures. The composition of simple and core–shell
fibers, which have been obtained by both uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning,
respectively, has been corroborated by Fourier-transform infrared
and micro-Raman spectroscopies. Morphological studies suggest that
the incorporation of PEG enhances the packing of PLA and PAni chains,
allowing the regulation of the thickness of the fibers. PAni and PEG
affect the thermal and electrical properties of the fibers, both decreasing
the glass transition temperature and increasing the electrical conductivity.
Interestingly, the incorporation of PEG improves the PAni-containing
paths associated with the conduction properties. Although dose response
curves evidence the high cytotoxicity of PAni/DBSA, cell adhesion
and cell proliferation studies on PLA/PAni fibers show a reduction
of such harmful effects as the conducting polymer is mainly retained
inside the fibers through favorable PAni···PLA interactions.
The incorporation of PEG into uniaxial fibers resulted in an increment
of the cell mortality, which has been attributed to its rapid dissolution
into the culture medium and the consequent enhancement of PAni release.
In opposition, the delivery of PAni decreases and, therefore, the
biocompatibility of the fibers increases when a shell coating the
PAni-containing system is incorporated through coaxial electrospinning.
Finally, morphological and functional studies using cardiac cells
indicated that these fibrous scaffolds are suitable for cardiac tissue
engineering applications.

==== Body
Introduction
Lots
of conductive biomaterials have been tested for their application
as smart scaffolds for tissue repair and regeneration.1−9 In addition to graphene,1,2 gold nanoparticles,3 carbon nanotubes,4 and so forth, nondegradable conducting polymers (CPs) have been
successfully blended and composited with biodegradable polymers for
such biomedical applications.5−11 One of the most important questions for the application in tissue
engineering of CPs, which are highly compatible with many biological
molecules and living systems, is their inherent inability to degrade.
This limits the in vivo application of these materials and the scaffolds
may require surgical removal. Therefore, combining CPs with biodegradable
polymers to obtain materials with electroactive and biodegradable
properties at the same time has received growing interest.

Among
CPs, polypyrrole and polythiophene (PTh) derivatives have
been the most employed for tissue regeneration applications because
of their biocompatibility.5−15 In contrast, biomedical applications of polyaniline (PAni) are controversial
because of the uncertainty in its cytotoxicity, which in the best
case is considered to present time- and/or dose-dependent hazardous
potential.16−20 However, PAni has a number of advantages, including high electrical
conductivity, excellent electronic and optical properties, good redox
and ion-exchange activity, environmental stability, ease of preparation
from common chemicals, and low cost.21,22

On the
other hand, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a 100% biodegradable
biopolymer that is manufactured from lactic acid, a renewable resource
derived from the starch of either corn or sugar beets that is fermented
to form glucose and, consequently, converted to lactic acid. Accordingly,
PLA is an important compound within the green chemistry context, as
it reduces significantly the carbon foot print when compared to other
oil-based traditional plastics. In addition to its usage in different
commercial and technological applications (e.g., automotive parts,
clothing and carpet fibers, and food packaging), PLA and its copolymers
are widely employed in the biomedical field because of the good mechanical
integrity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. Thus, these materials
have been employed for the fabrication of drug-loading and -release
devices, surgical sutures, and scaffolds for tissue and nerve regeneration.23−28

In spite of the uncertainty in their cytotoxicity, aniline
oligomers29−39 and PAni39−45 have emerged as electroactive moieties in tissue engineering. In
some cases, these electroactive compounds have been combined with
PLA. For example, biodegradable conductive polymers were synthesized
by conjugating small aniline oligomers with PLA to produce block copolymers31,32 and hyperbranched functionalized polyesters33,34 More recently, Liu et al.35 prepared
an electroactive diblock copolymer by conjugating poly(ethylene glycol)
(PEG) methyl ether and aniline tetramer (AT), which was subsequently
blended with PLA to decrease the cytotoxicity of AT. On the other
hand, Cui et al.36 prepared electroactive
biodegradable hydrogels from carboxyl-capped-AT/PLA/PEG/PLA/carboxyl-capped-AT
copolymers. That work was inspired by the approach previously developed
by Albertsson and co-workers,37 which synthesized
hydrogels with similar properties using acrylated PLA/PEG/PLA with
AT. Also, the same group transformed the surface of PLA into conductive
and hydrophilic by grafting AT units.38 Wu et al.39 reported novel conductive
biodegradable polyurethane based on the poly(glycerol sebacate)-co-aniline pentamer to enhance Schwann cells’ myelin
gene expressions and neurotrophin secretion for peripheral nerve regeneration.

McKeon et al.41 electrospun PLA and
PAni together to create biodegradable, biocompatible, and electrically
conductive scaffolds. Although nanofibers were successfully attained
with various PLA/PAni ratios, only the 75:25 scaffold conducted a
significant current. Nevertheless, the high amount of PAni released
upon degradation of PLA prevented this blend from being used as the
primary component in biomedical devices.41 This problem was mitigated by preparing PLA/PAni electrospun nanofibrous
sheets with a lower content of PAni (1.5 to 3 wt %) doped with camphorsulfonic
acid.42 The resulting scaffolds exhibited
good cell viability and a promoting effect on differentiation of H9c2
cardiomyoblasts in terms of maturation index and fusion index. Zhao
et al.43 developed a new series of in situ-forming
antibacterial-conductive degradable hydrogels using quaternized chitosan
(QCS)-grafted PAni with oxidized dextran as crosslinker. The electroactive
hydrogels could significantly enhance the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts
compared to the QCS hydrogel. Al-Jallad et al.44 developed an oxidative solution polymerization of PAni
onto electrospun nonwoven fiber mats of PLA. However, in this case
no biomedical application was proposed because of the high content
of PAni. In a very recent work, PAni nanoparticles polymerized from
aniline in a PLA solution were used to produce an electrically conductive
nanofibrous composite by thermal-induced phase separation.45 These scaffolds promoted osteogenic differentiation
of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells for bone engineering.

Among the potential applications in tissue engineering of CPs,
cardiac tissue regeneration is of special interest because of their
intrinsic electrical behavior. The generation of electrical impulses
by pacemaker cells together with a complex network of interconnected
cardiomyocytes results in a coordinated contraction and maintenance
of the heart rhythm.46−48 Cardiovascular diseases are the world’s leading
cause of mortality,49 and typical strategies
for cardiac tissue engineering rely on the generation of a functional
cardiac graft for implantation and the use of different biomaterials
for engraftment of stem cells. However, one of the main issues associated
with the development of such cardiac constructs for regenerative therapies
is the poor electrical integration of the construct with the host
tissue. This integration is critical to prevent secondary complications
related to graft and host asynchrony, frequently leading to arrhythmias,
which can be fatal if untreated.50−52 Additionally, electrical
stimulation of cardiac cells and specially stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
has been proven to stimulate maturation and improve cardiac functions.53−57 Similarly, the development of cardiac tissues for drug screening
also requires electrical interconnectivity to truly reproduce tissue
behavior.58 Thus, the use of conductive
biomaterials as scaffolds for cardiac cells is a very promising tool
and has already been demonstrated to be valuable for cardiac cell
function.59,60 In a recent study, a sophisticated PAni-based
conductive scaffold for cardiac tissue engineering was reported by
Guo and co-workers.61 This consisted in
a hybrid scaffold based on aligned poly(caprolactone), silk fibroin,
and PAni nanofiber yarn network layers within a hydrogel shell for
mimicking the native tissue structure, which demonstrated its great
potential for engineering 3D cardiac constructs.

In this work,
we propose a new strategy using soluble PAni doped
with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), prepared by one-step emulsion
polymerization, to electrospin fibrous scaffolds with PLA or PLA/PEG
mixtures. The advantage of concomitantly employing PLA and PEG is
the ease in the processing ability of the former, the high biocompatibility
of the latter, and the plasticizer effect of PEG, which is expected
to regulate the structure and properties of the PLA/PAni fibers.62−65 Uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning have been used to obtain simple
and core–shell fibers, respectively. More specifically, uniaxial
fibers have been electrospun using PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG/PAni mixtures
with different ratios, whereas polymer solutions based on PLA/PAni
(core) and PLA or PLA/PEG (shell) mixtures have been used for coaxial
electrospinning. The incorporation of PAni and PEG in the structural,
spectroscopic, thermal, and electrical properties of PLA electrospun
fibers has been examined. After this, the cytotoxicity of PAni doped
with DBSA, hereafter PAni/DBSA, and the biocompatibility of the different
uniaxial and core–shell PAni-containing fibers have been examined.
Finally, the suitability of the new scaffolds for cardiac tissue engineering
applications was evaluated using cardiac primary cells isolated from
neonatal mice hearts.

Morphology
Representative
scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) micrographs of PLA, PLA/PAni-2.5, -5, -7.5, and -10% fibers
(Table 1) captured
at different magnifications are displayed in Figure 1. In all cases, long and abundant microfibers
with cylindrical morphology, which were randomly distributed in porous
fibrous mats, were attained. High-magnification micrographs indicate
that the surface texture of the fibers did not undergo major changes
with the composition, even though the slightly rough appearance of
the PLA surface changes to a smoother aspect in PLA/PAni. Figure 1 includes the monomodal
diameter distributions (around 200 measures were considered for each
system) observed for the samples prepared under the optimized conditions
described in the Methods section. The diameter
distribution is wider for PLA/PAni fibers than for PLA fibers. In
general, diameters so different as 2 and 10 μm were clearly
distinguished for PLA/PAni, whereas the diameter variability of neat
PLA fibers was from 1.2 to ∼3 μm only. In spite of such
notable variability, the distribution profiles of PLA/PAni fibers
show a predominant size of 3–5 μm, independently of the
CP concentration. It is worth noting that the average diameter of
the fibers increases with the PAni concentration in the electrospinning
mixture (i.e., values progressively increase from 3.5 to 5.2 μm
when the PAni content grows from 2.5 to 10% w/w). The opposite effect
was observed for fibers prepared using a mixture of PLA and poly(3-thiophene
methyl acetate), a soluble PTh derivative, for which a slight reduction
of the average diameter was detected.66

Figure 1 SEM
micrographs taken at low (left) and high (center) magnification
for electrospun fibers of PLA and PLA/PAni-2.5, -5, -7.5, and -10%
samples. The diameter distribution of the electrospun microfibers
is displayed at the right.

Because of the affinity of PEG toward chloroform, which is
stronger
than that of PLA, and its plasticizing effect, electrospun PLA/PEG/PAni
fibers were prepared as described in the Methods section (Table 1).
The addition of a small fraction of PEG to the feeding solution resulted
in the achievement of a denser packing of the PLA and PAni chains
through microphase segregation between PLA and PEG.31 Representative SEM micrographs and diameter distribution
of PLA/PEG-0.1/PAni and PLA/PEG-0.3/PAni fibers are displayed in Figure 2a. Although PLA/PEG/PAni
fibers maintain a cylindrical shape and texture observed for PLA/PAni-5%,
independently of the PEG content, the diameter experiences a drastic
reduction (i.e., about half), which has been attributed to the plasticizer
effect of PEG. Thus, the diameter of PLA/PEG/PAni fibers is 2.3–2.4
μm, whereas the diameter of PLA/PAni-5% is around 4 μm.
These observations confirm that the packing of PLA chains undergoes
a significant enhancement upon the incorporation of a small fraction
of PEG to the feeding mixture.

high (center) magnification

samples and (b) PLA-0.3/PAni and PLA-0.1/PAni samples. The diameter
distribution of the electrospun microfibers is displayed at the right.

The main structural characteristics
of the fibers were maintained
after removal of PEG from PLA/PEG/PAni fibers by solvent etching using
water. This is evidenced in Figure 2b, which compares the morphology, texture, and diameter
of PLA-0.3/PAni and PLA-0.1/PAni. The shape and texture of the fibers
did not experience any significant change with respect to PLA/PEG/PAni
fibers, whereas the diameter reduced by ∼0.2 μm after
the selective etching process. The lack of holes in the surface of
PLA-0.3/PAni and PLA-0.1/PAni fibers suggests that PEG was organized
in nanodomains in the corresponding PLA/PEG/PAni fibers. This hypothesis
is supported by root-mean-square (rms) roughness measurements, which
were conducted by profilometry. Thus, the roughness of PLA-0.3/PAni
and PLA-0.1/PAni fibers (Rq = 138 ±
23 and 103 ± 21 nm, respectively) was similar to that of PLA/PEG-0.3/PAni
and PLA/PEG-0.1/PAni (Rq = 149 ±
41 and 116 ± 22 nm, respectively).

Core–shell PLA//PLA/PAni
and PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni fibers, which
were obtained using the operating conditions optimized for uniaxial
fibers, are displayed in Figure 3a. As it can be seen, undesirable beads were formed
in all cases. The formation of these structural defects has been attributed
to the fact that the combination of mixtures of polymers increases
the surface tension favoring the solidification of droplets into beads
supported on fibers.67 The number of beads
decreased considerably for PLA/PEG-0.1//PLA/PAni, suggesting that
the integration between the shell and the PAni-containing core becomes
easier when a small amount of PEG is incorporated into the shell electrospinning
solution. Most importantly, the diameter of the fibers decreases upon
the incorporation of PEG in comparison with PLA//PLA/PAni (i.e., 0.5
and 1.0 μm for PLA/PEG-0.1//PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG-0.3//PLA/PAni,
respectively). This is consistent with the enhancement of the packing
of the PLA chains at the core. Core–shell fibers kept the structure
after etching the PEG (Figure 3b), even though the average diameter reduced at the sub-micrometric
scale.

at the right.

Representative atomic
force microscopy (AFM) topographic and phase-contrast
images of PLA, PLA/PAni-5%, and PLA/PAni-10% fibers are compared in Figure 4. The fibers present
a smooth surface and well-defined topography, the rms roughness being Rq = 11.6 ± 3.7, 17.4 ± 2.9, and 11.3
± 0.6 nm, respectively. Phase-contrast images suggest that the
CP is organized in nanoaggregates, which are identified by dark spots,
very close to each other, probably forming conducting pathways.

topographic and phase-contrast AFM images (left
and right, respectively) of PLA, PLA/PAni-5%, and PLA/PAni-10% electrospun
fibers.

Inspection of the cross section
of fibers obtained by coaxial electrospinning
using different microscopy techniques did not provide direct evidence
about their core–shell structure. However, the thermal and
electrical properties and, especially, the biological response of
these fibers were very different to those of simple fibers (see below),
suggesting that coaxial electrospinning led to the expected core–shell
structure.

Spectroscopic Characterization of Electrospun
Fibers
The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
spectrum of the
as-prepared PAni/DBSA is displayed in Figure S1. The main bands, which are in agreement with those previously reported
in the literature,68,69 appear at 3450 cm–1 (N–H stretching), 2963 and 2924 cm–1 (aromatic
C–H asymmetric stretching), 1547 and 1455 cm–1 (C=C stretching of quinoid and benzenoid ring, respectively),
1325 cm–1 (N–H bending), 1245 cm–1 (C–N stretching), and 1187 and 839 cm–1 (in-plane and out-of-plane C–H bending, respectively).

The FTIR spectra of PLA/PAni and neat PLA fibers are highly similar
(Figure 5a) because
of both the low content of PAni and the low intensity of the bands
associated with its nonpolar and weakly polar groups. Therefore, the
C=O stretching vibration at 1755 cm–1 and
the asymmetric and symmetric C–O stretching at 1184 and 1086
cm–1, respectively, are the more intense bands of
PLA, whereas the signals of PAni/DBSA are identified as shoulders
only. More specifically, the shoulders at 1258, 1558, and 2973 cm–1 have been attributed to the C–N stretching
of primary aromatic amine, C=C stretching of the ring, and
aromatic C–H stretching, respectively. On the other hand, uniaxial
PLA/PEG/PAni and core–shell PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni fibers (Figures S2 and S3, respectively) show almost
the same absorption peaks as PLA/PAni, indicating that there is no
bond formed or strong chemical interaction occurring within the blend.
Thus, the most important difference is the apparition of the aliphatic
C–H stretching band at 2855 cm–1, which has
been attributed to the PEG (i.e., many typical bands associated with
PEG overlap with those of PLA).

Figure 5 (a) FTIR spectra of PLA and PLA/PAni uniaxial
fibers. The most
important bands for PLA and PAni are indicated in black and red, respectively.
(b) PLA and PLA/PAni-10% Raman spectra at the cross points in the
optical images (scale bar: 50 μm).

Further studies were carried out to understand the compositional
distribution of PLA/PAni fibers by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy. Figure 5b compares the Raman
spectra and microscopy images of PLA and PLA/PAni-10% fibers. The
most intense band in the PLA spectrum corresponds to the C–COO
stretching and is located at 871 cm–1. Other strong
and medium peaks in the PLA Raman spectrum appear at 1755 and 1771
cm–1 (splitting patterns of C=O stretching),
1453 cm–1 (δCH3 asymmetric mode),
1385 cm–1 (symmetric δCH3 deformation),
1215 and 1095 cm–1 (asymmetric and symmetric C–O–C
deformation, respectively), 1128 cm–1 (CH3 rocking), and 1042 cm–1 (C–CH3 stretching).70

Figure 5b displays
the Raman spectra of two different spots of PLA/PAni-10% fibers using
a source of 785 nm as exciting radiation. The spectrum recorded for
the dark spot (blue line) has been associated with PAni/DBSA,71,72 showing characteristic bands at 1193 cm–1 (C–H
bending of the quinoid ring), 1257 (C–N stretching), 1318 and
1341 cm–1 (C–N+ stretching), 1584
cm–1 (C–C stretching), and 1626 cm–1 (C–H stretching of the benzenoid ring). Among these bands,
the intense overlapped ones at 1318 and 1341 cm–1 are particularly relevant as they are related with the C–N+, stretching the modes of delocalized polaronic charge carriers,
which is characteristic of the protonated imine form of PAni. The
spectrum recorded for the second spot of the PLA/PAni-10%, which is
located in the clearest area of the fiber (blue line), is also dominated
by the CP signatures, evidencing that the scattering from PLA is very
weak compared with that from PAni/DBSA. However, the change in the
intensity of the bands in the spectra recorded for the two spots is
consistent with the formation of interactions between PLA and PAni
chains.

Inspection of the Raman spectra recorded for uniaxial
PLA/PEG-0.3/PAni
and core–shell PLA/PEG-0.3//PLA/PAni fibers, which are compared
in Figure S4, indicates that the bands
of PAni also dominate in the presence of PEG. The predominance of
the PAni bands in blends with insulating polymers is due to the resonance
Raman effect, which increases the intensity of the bands of the material
when the laser energy coincides with the frequency of the electronic
transition of the sample.73,74 In blends of PAni with
PLA and PEG, only the former absorbs in the wavelength of the employed
exciting radiation, the intensities of its bands being enhanced with
respect to those of insulating polymers.

Thermal, Electrical, and
Mechanical Characterization
Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) was employed to characterize
thermal properties of PLA and PLA/PAni microfiber mats, and the results
are displayed in Figure 6a. The DSC heating thermogram recorded for PLA indicates that the
glass temperature, Tg, at 64 °C is
followed by a broad exothermic peak corresponding to the cold polymer
crystallization, which is consistent with the high molecular orientation
attained in the electrospinning process,74 and a sharp melting peak, Tm, at 168
°C also appears. The melting enthalpy is higher than the crystallization
enthalpy (ΔHm = 26.4 J/g and ΔHc = 11.6 J/g), proving that some fraction of
PLA was able to crystallize during the electrospinning process. All
PLA/PAni samples show a clear glass transition, as could be presumed
for amorphous samples, and a typical relaxation endothermic peak,
which indicates that metastable PLA glassy material achieves equilibrium
thermodynamic conditions with lower specific volume, enthalpy, and
entropy. The concentration of CP in PLA/PAni blends has a remarkable
influence on the characteristic Tg and Tm, especially when the content of PAni is ≥5%
w/w (Table 2). Thus,
the Tg and Tm decrease 12 and 9 °C, respectively, when the content of PAni
in PLA fibers increases from 2.5 to 10% w/w. These observations are
consistent with the DSC results for PAni/DBSA, which exhibited a Tg as low as 14 °C (Figure S5).

glass transition
and melting temperatures (Tg and Tm, respectively) are indicated. (b) Electrical

PLA/PEG-0.1//PLA/PAni	51.6	168.0	10.2	30.3	
Comparison of PLA with PLA/PEG/PAni
fibers (Figure S6 and Table 2) reveals similar features.
Interestingly, the uniaxial fibers
with the lowest PEG content, PLA/PEG-0.1/PAni, experienced the largest
reduction in the Tg (13 °C) with
respect to PLA, indicating that the former polymer acts as a plasticizer.
This effect becomes more apparent with increasing PEG content. Comparison
of core–shell PLA//PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni fibers (Figure S7 and Table 2) revealed that the incorporation of PEG
at the shell causes a reduction of 9–11 °C, depending
on the concentration. Overall, calorimetric results show that the Tm remains at ∼167 °C independently
of the fibers’ composition and architecture, whereas such parameters
cause a reduction in the Tg of up to 14.8
°C with respect to PLA.

Electrical conductivities of all
uniaxial and core–shell
fibrous mats are compared in Figure 6b. The conductivity of PLA/PAni fibers increases with
the amount of conduction paths, which grow with the content of CP.
In spite of this, such increment is not particularly noticeable (i.e.,
from 0.23 ± 0.05 μS/cm for PLA/PAni-2.5% to 0.99 ±
0.05 μS/cm for PLA/PAni-10%). Unfortunately, determination of
the electrical conductivity of PAni/DBSA was not possible as the CP
films prepared for this purpose were extremely brittle. On the other
hand, the incorporation of PEG to the microfibers results in a slight
increment of the conductivity (i.e., from 0.24 ± 0.04 μS/cm
for PLA/PAni-5% to 0.53 ± 0.14 μS/cm for PLA/PEG-0.1/PAni).
This feature suggests that the enhancement of the PLA packing induced
by the microphase segregation between PLA and PEG facilitates the
interaction among neighboring CP chains and, therefore, the improvement
of conduction paths. This hypothesis is consistent with the increment
of the conductivity with the PEG content. Finally, the conductivity
of the core–shell fibrous mats is similar (i.e., ∼0.5
μS) in all cases. Thus, although fibers prepared by coaxial
electrospinning present different shell compositions, the content
of PAni in the core was kept at 5% w/w.

The mechanical properties
of PLA, PLA/PAni-5%, and PLA//PLA/PAni
electrospun fibers, which have been chosen as representative because
of their subsequent utilization in functional studies using cardiac
cells (see below), have been evaluated and the results are displayed
in Table 3. It is found
that Young’s modulus and the strength of electrospun fiber
mats are much lower compared with bulk PLA (∼3.5 GPa), which
has been attributed to the combined effects of the porosity of the
mats and the lack of orientation of the fibers. Besides, PLA mats
display a slightly higher Young’s modulus than PAni-containing
systems, which is presumably due to its higher crystallinity as well
as to the poor mechanical integrity of PAni. Also, PAni-containing
systems exhibit a slightly lower failure strain, which may be explained
by their heterogeneous structure in comparison with PLA.

PAni/DBSA Cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicity induced by
the increasing concentration of PAni/DBSA in NRK, MCF-7, and MG-63
cells was estimated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) test, which is based on measuring the viability of cells
under treatment in comparison with untreated controls. The dose response
curves, which are compared in Figure 7a, indicate that exposition to very low concentrations
of PAni/DBSA (i.e., <0.01% w/w) does not cause serious toxicity,
even though the harmful effects induced by this CP increases very
rapidly. The cytotoxicity curves exhibit a similar shape in all cases,
indicating that the CP uses a single mechanism to kill the cells,
independently of the cell line. Although the study of such mechanism
is not within the scope of this work, previous studies16 suggested that, after entering into the cytoplasm,
PAni contacts the mitochondria, increasing its membrane porosity and
unbalancing the electrolytes inside. Thus, PAni-induced alteration
of the mitochondrial function could probably interrupt the respiratory
chain. On the other hand, the half cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of PAni/DBSA is comprised between 0.03 and 0.04% w/w (Figure 7a), which actually
is a very low CP concentration.

NRK, MCF-7, and MG-63 cells.
(b,c) Biocompatibility of PLA/PAni fibers expressed as relative viability
of NRK and MG-63 culture cells onto the fibrous mats after (b) 24
h (cell adhesion) and (c) 96 h (cell proliferation).

On the basis of these results, the biocompatibility
of PLA/PAni
fibers has been tested by examining the adhesion and proliferation
of cultured NRK and MG-63 cells on fibrous mats with growing PAni
content. Thus, cell adhesion evaluates cytotoxicity as an early event,
whereas cell proliferation evaluates a chronic effect of prolonged
cytotoxicity. Figure 7b shows the percentage of cells that have adhered after 24 h in culture.
The adhesion on PLA films decreases upon the incorporation of PAni,
even though such reduction is only 11–20% on PLA/PAni-2.5%
and PLA/PAni-5%. The adhesion decreases by more than 45 and 80% in
fibers with 7.5 and 10% w/w of PAni, respectively. Cell proliferation,
which was determined by evaluating the cell viability after 96 h,
exhibits a drastic dependence of the PAni-content in the fibers (Figure 7c). Thus, the cell
viability on PLA/PAni-2.5, -5, -7.5, and 10% decreases by around 20,
50, 80, and 90%, respectively, after such time interval.

Figure 7b,c reflects
a clear dose-dependent effect of PAni on the biocompatibility of PLA/PAni
fibers. Comparison of these results with the cytotoxicity curve displayed
in Figure 7a indicates
that, although PAni mainly remains inside the prepared fibers, a small
fraction is released to the cell culture medium. For example, if a
complete release is assumed, the content of CP in 1 mL of cell culture
medium should be estimated to be around 0.12–0.15% w/w when
a ∼20 mg of PLA/PAni-7.5% is maintained inside. According to Figure 7a, such concentration
of PAni is high enough to kill 100% of the cell population exposed
to the fibrous mat sample. However, Figure 7b shows that the cellular mortality is ∼55%
after 24 h, which corresponds to 0.03–0.04% w/w PAni in the
cytotoxicity curve. This feature reveals a release of 20–25%
of the CP loaded into PLA/PAni-7.5% fibers. Similar results are obtained
for the rest of PLA/PAni fibers, suggesting that attractive PLA···PAni
interactions are responsible for the retention of the CP inside the
matrix (i.e., otherwise, a total cell mortality should be immediately
observed). Moreover, such intermolecular interactions persist for
a long time as the fraction of surviving cells after 96 h is ∼10%.

Incorporation of biocompatible PEG into PAni-containing uniaxial
fibers resulted in an increment of the cell mortality. This effect,
which is reflected in Figure 8a,b for cell adhesion and cell proliferation, respectively,
grows with the content of PEG in the feeding PLA/PEG/PAni mixture.
This behavior has been attributed to the remarkable PEG hydrophilicity,
which rapidly dissolves into the culture medium, enhancing the porosity
of the fibers and, therefore, favoring the release of PAni to the
culture medium. As a consequence, the cell viability after both 24
and 96 h is ∼45% smaller for PLA/PEG-0.3/PAni than for PLA/PAni-5%
(Figure 8a,b).

Figure 8 Biocompatibility
of (a,b) PLA/PEG/PAni and (c,d) PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni
fibers expressed as relative viability of NRK and MG-63 culture cells
onto the fibrous mats after (a,c) 24 h (cell adhesion) and (b,d) 96
h (cell proliferation).

The incorporation of the shell at the PLA/PAni-5% core improves
significantly the biocompatibility of the fibers. This is reflected
in Figure 8c,d, which
compares the cell adhesion and proliferation, respectively, for PLA//PLA/PAni
PLA/PEG-0.3//PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG-0.1//PLA/PAni. As it can be seen,
core–shell fibers exhibit higher biocompatibility than uniaxial
fibers in all cases, indicating that the shell exerts a notable control
on the release of PAni from the core. Considering that PEG solubilizes
in the culture medium, results displayed in Figure 8c,d evidence that the PAni release is mainly
regulated by the porosity of the core, even though the shell also
has some influence. Thus, cell viabilities are ∼10–15%
lower for PLA/PEG-0.3//PLA/PAni than for PLA//PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG-0.1//PLA/PAni,
showing that the biocompatibility decreases with the porosity of the
shell.

Cardiac Cells on PLA/PAni-5% and PLA//PLA/PAni Fibrous Mats
The biocompatibility of PLA/PAni-5% and PLA//PLA/PAni materials
on cardiac cells was evaluated using cardiac primary cells isolated
from neonatal mice hearts. Cardiac fibroblasts were seeded on PLA
(control) and PLA/PAni-5% uniaxial fibers and PLA//PLA/PAni coaxial
fibers and a live/death assay was performed after 48 h of culture
(Figure 9a). Cardiac
fibroblasts were perfectly able to attach to the fibers and almost
any dead cell could be detected after 48 h. This result evidenced
again the biocompatibility observed before for these PLA- and PAni-containing
fibers, which is due to the retention of the CP within PLA fibers
through PAni···PLA interactions. Moreover, cardiac
fibroblasts exhibited a high affinity toward PLA, PLA/PAni-5%, and
PLA//PLA/PAni fibers where cells showed an elongated morphology, adapting
their actin cytoskeleton to the material matrix (Figure 9b).

coaxial and PLA/PAni-5% uniaxial fibers for 48 h (green: living cells;
red: dead cells). (b,c) Confocal images of cardiac fibroblasts (b)
and cardiomyocyte-enriched population (c) seeded on PLA//PLA/PAni
coaxial fibers and PLA/PAni-5% and PLA (control) uniaxial fibers after
48 h and 13 days of incubation, respectively (green: phalloidin; blue:
DAPI).

A cardiomyocyte-enriched population
of cells was also used for
the evaluation of the biocompatibility and suitability of PLA/PAni-5%
and PLA//PLA/PAni fibrous mats for cardiac tissue engineering. After
7 days of incubation, cardiomyocytes still maintain their ability
to beat on the fibers (Videos 1 and 2 display cardiomyocytes incubated on uniaxial
PLA/PAni-5% and coaxial PLA//PLA/PAni fibers for 7 days), indicating
that PLA/PAni-5% and PLA//PLA/PAni fibers are not only nontoxic to
cardiac cells, but they also do not impede the normal cardiomyocyte
functions and contractibility. In contrast, no beating activity was
detected for cardiomyocytes adhered to control PLA fibers, reflecting
that the electroactivity of PAni favors the functionality of cardiac
cells. On the other hand, cardiomyocytes showed good adherence and
survival after 13 days of culture on these mats, both uniaxial and
coaxial (Figure 9c),
being even able to colonize the material matrix with high interconnectivity
between cells.

Conclusions
Simple PLA, PLA/PAni,
and PLA/PEG/PAni fibers and core–shell
PLA/PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni fibers have been successfully prepared
by uniaxial and coaxial electrospinning, respectively. The diameter
of the uniaxial fibers increases with the PAni content, whereas it
decreases upon the addition of PEG to the feeding mixture. This reduction,
which is maintained after selective PEG etching, has been attributed
to the microphase segregation between PLA and PEG that induces a denser
packing of PLA and PAni chains. This effect is preserved in core–shell
PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni fibers. The glass transition and melting temperatures
of PLA/PAni fibers decrease with increasing concentration of PAni,
whereas the addition of PEG only affects the glass transition. Besides,
the electrical conductivity of the fibers increases with the PAni
content, as it was expected, and with the PEG content, which has been
attributed to the enhancement of PAni···PAni interactions.

Although PAni/DBSA has been found to be cytotoxic, this harmful
effect is significantly reduced in PLA/PAni fibers as the formation
of favorable PLA···PAni interactions avoids the release
of the CP from the fiber. Amazingly, the incorporation of PEG to uniaxial
fibers causes the opposite effect, reducing the biocompatibility of
the fibers. However, the biocompatibility of core–shell fibers
is higher than that of uniaxial fibers. Finally, the proposed PLA/PAni-5%
uniaxial and PLA//PLA/PAni coaxial fibers have demonstrated their
suitability for cardiac tissue engineering, overcoming the abovementioned
toxicity of the CP. The material offers very good adhesion for cardiac
cells, also being able to modulate cell shape and orientation, something
important for the characteristic anisotropy of the cardiac tissue.
The investigated fibers do not induce interferences or impediments
for the developing of the beating and contraction functions of cardiomyocytes,
supporting their promising applicability in cardiac tissue engineering
and the developing of cardiac grafts.

Methods
Materials
Aniline monomer (Neon Comercial Ltda) was
previously distilled and stored under refrigeration. DBSA (Nacure
5076, King Industries), ammonium persulfate (APS; Neon Comercial Ltda),
and toluene (Neon Comercial Ltda; solvent reagent grade) were used
without further purification. Distilled water was used for the emulsion
polymerization.

PLA, a product of NatureWorks (polymer 3001D),
was kindly supplied by Nupik International (Polinyà, Spain).
According to the manufacturer, this PLA has a D content
of ∼1.5%, a residual monomer content of 0.3%, density of 1.24
g/cm3, glass transition temperature of Tg = 55–60 °C, and melting point of Tm = 155–170 °C. The number and weight
average molecular weights and polydispersity index, as determined
by gel permeation chromatography, were Mn = 98 100 g/mol, Mw = 181 000
g/mol and 1.85, respectively. PEG samples of Mn = 35 000 g/mol, acetonitrile, and chloroform (analytical
reagent grade) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis of
PAni
PAni doped with DBSA, hereafter PAni/DBSA,
was obtained using a previously described procedure.75 Specific details are provided in the Supporting Information.

Electrospun Uniaxial and
Coaxial Fibers
Control PLA
fibers were electrospun from chloroform/acetone (2:1 v/v) at a polymer
concentration of 16.6% w/v. For uniaxial PLA/PAni fiber preparation,
PLA/PAni mixtures with 2.5–10% w/w PAni (relative to PLA) were
dissolved in chloroform at a polymer concentration of 16.6% w/v. Hereafter,
PLA/PAni samples will be identified indicating the PAni weight percentage
ratio (e.g., PLA/PAni-5% corresponds to a mixture with 5% w/w of PAni
relative to PLA). For the preparation of uniaxial PLA/PEG/PAni fibers,
PLA/PEG mixtures with 0.7:0.3 and 0.9:0.1 w/w ratios were dissolved
in chloroform at a polymer concentration of 16.6% w/v, whereas the
PAni concentration was maintained at 5% w/w (relative to PLA/PEG).
Samples will be identified indicating the PEG fraction in the PLA/PEG
mixture (e.g., PLA/PEG-0.3/PAni corresponds to a 0.7:0.3 w/w PLA/PEG
mixture with 5% w/w of PAni relative to PLA/PEG). After this, the
PEG was etched from PLA/PEG/PAni fibers using water. For this purpose,
the fibers were kept submerged for 24 h. After PEG elimination, the
resulting PLA/PAni fibers will be identified maintaining the PEG’s
fraction from the initial feeding mixture (e.g., PLA-0.3/PAni corresponds
to the fibers obtained by dissolving the PEG molecules of PLA/PEG-0.3/PAni).

Coaxial electrospinning was performed by varying the composition
of the polymer mixtures used for the shell. These were PLA and PLA/PEG
(0.7:0.3 and 0.9:0.1 w/w PLA/PEG) in chloroform at a polymer concentration
of 8.3% w/v. The core was electrospun using a PLA/PAni mixture with
5% w/w of PAni (relative to PLA) dissolved in chloroform at a polymer
concentration of 8.3% w/v. The code used to denote coaxial fibers
refers to the composition of the solutions used for the shell//core
(e.g., PLA/PEG-0.3//PLA/PAni indicates that the shell was electrospun
using a 0.7:0.3 w/w PLA/PEG mixture whereas the core comes from a
PLA/PAni mixture with 5% w/w-of PAni relative to PLA). As described
above for uniaxial PLA/PEG/PAni fibers, PEG was etched from PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni
coaxial fibers using water. Table 1 summarizes the nomenclature and composition of all
fibers prepared in this work.

Operating conditions were optimized
for PLA/PAni and PLA//PLA/PAni
fibers and, subsequently, used to produce the PLA/PEG/PAni and PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni
ones. The solutions were mixed and loaded in a 5 mL BD (Becton Dickinson
Co., Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) plastic syringe for delivery through
an 18 G needle tip (inside diameter 0.84 mm) at a mass-flow rate of
5 mL/h for uniaxial electrospinning, and through a coaxial system
with 14 G (shell) and 21 G (core) needles (inside diameter of 1.6
and 0.8 mm, respectively) at a mass-flow rate of 1.2 mL/h for coaxial
electrospinning, using a KDS100 infusion pump (KD Scientific, USA).
The voltage, which was applied through a high-voltage Gamma High Voltage
Research (ES30-5W) power supply, was 15 kV for PLA, PLA/PAni, and
PLA/PEG/PAni fibers, increasing to 20 kV for PLA//PLA/PAni and PLA/PEG//PLA/PAni
ones. All electrospun fibers were obtained using a needle tip-collector
distance of 25 cm. All electrospinning experiments were carried out
at room temperature.

Characterization
Characterization
was carried out using
SEM, AFM, FTIR, and micro-Raman spectroscopies, DSC, and electrical
measurements. Details are provided in the Supporting Information.

Cytotoxicity
Cellular assays were
performed using normal
rat fibroblasts (NRK) and epithelial cells derived from breast adenocarcinoma
(MCF-7) and osteosarcoma (MG-63). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 4500 mg of glucose/L and
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/mL),
and streptomycin (100 μg/mL). The cultures were maintained in
a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and
95% O2 at 37 °C. Culture media were changed every
2 days. When cells reached 80–90% confluence, they were detached
using 1–2 mL of trypsin [0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)] for 5 min at 37 °C. Finally, cells were re-suspended
in 5 mL of fresh medium and their concentration was determined with
a Neubauer camera using 0.4% trypan blue.

Fiber mats were placed
in plates of 24 wells, adhered with a small drop of silicone (Silbione
MED ADH 4300 RTV, Bluestar Silicones France SAS, Lyon, France), and
sterilized using UV irradiation for 15 min in a laminar flux cabinet.
An aliquot of 50 μL containing 5 × 104 and 2
× 104 cells was deposited on the film surface at each
well for adhesion and proliferation assays, respectively. Bare steel
sheets were used as controls. Attachment of the cells was promoted
by incubation under culture conditions for 30 min. Finally, 1 mL of
the culture medium was added to each well. In order to evaluate cell
viability after 24 and 96 h, colorimetric MTT assays were conducted.
Specifically, 50 μL of MTT solution [5 mg/mL in phosphate buffered
saline (PBS)] was added to each well. After 3 h of incubation, samples
were washed twice with PBS and stored in clean wells. In order to
dissolve the formed formazan crystals, 0.5 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide/methanol/water
(70/20/10% v/v) was added. Finally, the absorbance was measured in
a plate reader at 570 mm using 200 μL of dissolution. Viability
results derived from the average of five replicates (n = 5) for each independent experiment were normalized to tissue culture
polystyrene as relative percentages (control).

Cardiac Cell Viability
and Adhesion
Cardiac primary
cells were obtained from CD1 neonatal mouse following a series of
enzymatic digestions. Briefly, hearts from 1 to 3 day-old mice were
extracted, cleaned, and minced into small pieces using curved scissors.
Tissue fragments underwent a predigestion step by incubating in trypsin/EDTA
solution 0.25% with 4 μg/mL DNase I and subjected to 20–25
cycles of enzymatic digestion using collagenase II and dispase II
in L-15 medium. Pooled supernatants were collected through a 70 μm
nylon cell strainer and the pellet was resuspended in DMEM containing
1 g/L glucose supplemented with 19% M-199 medium, 10% horse serum,
5% FBS, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. The cell suspension was
plated into a 10 cm cell culture dish in order to separate the non-myocytic
cell fraction of the heart, mainly fibroblasts, and obtain an enriched
population of cardiomyocytes.

Fibers mats were placed in 24-well
plates, fixed using Teflon rings and sterilized by UV irradiation
for 15 min in a laminar flux cabinet. Cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes
were seeded and culture on fiber mats for the indicated time at 37
°C and 5% CO2. Culture media were replaced every 2–3
days. Incubation with calcein-AM and propidium iodide for 20 min was
employed for live/death assay. For cell morphology observation, cardiac
cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 4% solution and stained with
Acti-stain 488 phalloidin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for the actin cytoskeleton and nucleus visualization, respectively.
Fluorescence images were taken using a Confocal Microscope LSM 800
(Zeiss). The beating analysis was performed using an inverted microscope
Leica DM IL LED. The videos were recorded at 19 fps with a 1024 ×
768 pixel resolution.
