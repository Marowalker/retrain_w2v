In
this work, we present our magnetron sputtering based methodology
to produce amorphous silicon coatings with closed porosity, as a strategy
to fabricate solid helium targets, in the form of supported or self-supported
thin films, for nuclear reactions. We show how by changing the He
working pressure it is possible to obtain highly porous homogeneous
structures incorporating different He amounts. These porous coatings
(a-Si:He) are very reproducible from run to run, and the high He amount
incorporated makes them excellent candidates for solid He targets.
The possibility of producing self-supported films is illustrated here,
and its potential use in inverse kinematics experiments with radioactive
beams is shown through the dispersion in forward geometry of a stable 6Li beam. Also the elastic scattering cross-sections for proton
from helium were determined using an a-Si:He coating. The results
agree well with the ones reported in the literature. These two examples
validate our coatings as good candidates to be used as solid He targets
in nuclear reactions. The stability of He inside the coatings, fundamental
for its use as solid He targets, was investigated, both over time
and after irradiation. The coatings proved to be very stable, and
the amount of He inside the pores remains unaltered at least 2 years
after deposition and after high irradiation fluence (5 × 1017 particles/cm2; with a dose rate of 5 × 1012 particles/(cm2 s)).

Introduction
Nanostructured thin
films and surfaces obtained by low-energy helium
plasma treatments or by He incorporation via magnetron sputtering
have been paid attention as strategies to modify and optimize materials
properties.1−4 Irradiation of metals with light ions, and in particular He, has
been a subject of study for many years due to its technological interest
in nuclear reactor materials.5−7 Helium has been reported to be
insoluble in different metals and tends to accumulate forming small
bubbles causing damage in nuclear reactors.7 Also considerable interest was found in the use of these materials
for microelectronics, where the cavities produced by the implanted
He act as impurity getters,8,9 or more recently in
energy conversion or storage devices.2,4,10

As an alternative route to top-down methods
for producing porous
materials, we have recently proposed a bottom-up methodology to grow
porous silicon-based coatings, with closed porosity by magnetron sputtering.11−13 The approach is a very versatile methodology based on magnetron
sputtering technology, and thus extensible to a wide variety of materials
and substrates, which in the presence of He plasmas allows the deposition
of porous coatings with a decreased refractive index.12,14 These highly porous coatings incorporate high He amounts (up to
40 atom %) inside the closed pores evenly distributed throughout the
film thickness.14,15 The high He density stored could
be very appealing for applications in nuclear physics or nuclear astrophysics,
where light particle targets are of key importance in the spectroscopic
and nuclear structure studies of unstable nuclei or even more fundamental
studies of accurate elastic scattering cross-section determination
for elemental analysis of these light elements.

Recent experiments
with radioactive beams offer the opportunity
to extend basic knowledge about nuclear structures of nuclei far from
the stability line (“exotic” nuclei). It is not feasible
to produce a radioactive target for irradiation due to the very short
half-life of these nuclei. Experiments of inverse kinematics, where
the desired radioactive beams are produced and investigated through
interactions with a stable target, are the solution to that problem.
Single nucleon stripping and pickup reactions with He and H isotopes
provide fundamental structural information, in particular spectroscopic
factors. Moreover, reactions involving elastic scattering and neutron
transfer are also of interest in this matter. In addition, the interaction
of stable beams with He targets is also of interest, as is explained
further in this introduction.

Over the years different possibilities
have been investigated for
the use of stable hydrogen or helium in the form of gas or solid targets
facing, however, some experimental challenges. Static gas targets,
consisting of gas chambers, limit the accessible angular range due
to their geometry, and the windows of the gas cell interfere with
the beam losing energy and therefore introducing background reactions.16,17 Windowless gas targets do not present the above-mentioned problems;
however, there is a strong limitation in helium thickness (i.e., atoms/cm2), and expensive pumping stations are required to maintain
the necessary pressure.17

To overcome
this problem, an elegant solution was found for hydrogen
targets in the form of polymers as polypropylene or polyethylene.18 However, in the case of reactions involving
radioactive beams and He, as He does not form any chemical compounds,
other solutions must be explored. The major requirements for a solid
He target to be used in nuclear reactions are high He concentration
(especially in the case of interaction with exotic nuclei that have
very low beam current) and homogeneity versus depth, as well as high
stability of the bulk He concentration versus time.194He-implanted target foils were proposed,16,20 but apart from being expensive, reproducible results satisfying
the demand for uniform distribution and concentrations are not easily
achieved from sample to sample and thus not suitable for extended
target production.21 In this work, we show
how our magnetron-sputtered silicon coatings could be promising and
versatile candidates to be used as He solid targets for nuclear reactions.
In a previous work,15 we have investigated
the physical parameters (density and pressure) of He inside the closed
pores of magnetron-sputtered amorphous silicon coatings in depth.
The work15 demonstrated how the prepared
coatings presented high density of homogeneously distributed pores
filled with helium in a condensed state. Moreover, our approach provides
reproducible coatings of a wide range of controlled thicknesses, with
homogeneous porosity and He concentration12,14 on a laboratory scale, without the need for ion implantation facilities,
which could be easily scaled up to an industrial process.

Another
disadvantage of He-implanted foils is the reported high
amounts of carbon and oxygen16,17 that produce intense
backgrounds. In implanted targets also, adequate choice of the host
material is very important, and low-Z materials are
preferred, as they will induce less beam scattering and thus less
background. We will show how our bottom-up methodology is suitable
for the preparation of self-supported amorphous silicon coatings,
as thin-film solid He targets, that would allow scattering studies
in forward geometry.

Here, the versatility of the methodology
to produce a-Si:He coatings
with different He contents is confirmed. The validation of our coatings
as solid He targets takes place in two parts. On the first example,
a self-supported coating is used as a proof of concept to illustrate
the potential of our films to be used as a solid He target in inverse
kinematics studies with exotic nuclei beams. For this kind of experiments,
targets must be self-supported, with an amount of He as high as possible
in low thickness and a low c/He ratio, where c refers to contamination
elements that could cause interferences in the spectra. The scattering
of a 6Li beam on this sample is studied for a fixed angle
of 30°, illustrating its potential use in inverse kinematics
studies with radioactive beams, for example 11Li.

On the second example, the differential cross-section of the reaction 4He(p,p)4He was determined at laboratory angles
between 110 and 165° for proton energies between 0.6 and 3.0
MeV, comparing our results with available datasets. Different ion
beam analysis (IBA) methods are based on the registration of elastically
scattered particles or the products of nuclear reactions, and a reliable
source of cross-section data is needed. In particular, proton elastic
backscattering (p-EBS) has been established as a valuable analytical
technique for the detection of light elements such as He, especially
in materials research.22 A strong signal
enhancement, of 2–3 orders of magnitude, is achieved in p-EBS
of light species in thin films relative to the corresponding Rutherford
value. The sensitivity depends on whether the low-energy backscattered
ion signal (in this case He) can be separated from the background
signals of the host material or substrate. Depth resolution and sensitivity
can be increased by increasing the incidence angle with respect to
the normal of the target surface, and usually scattering angles between
150 and 175° are desirable for separating various scattered and
reaction particles. However, because of the cross-section dependence
on angle, the available data are valid only in the case of a scattering
geometry very close to the geometry used in the cross-section measurements.
Intensive research work can be found in the literature;20,21,23−28 however, some discrepancies in reported cross-sections are related
to the target nature and associated restrictions.20,21 In this work, we present a comparison between our data and those
reported in the literature by other authors for similar conditions
and targets of different nature,20,21,23−28 evidencing the use of our coatings as solid He targets.

The
stability of the closed porous structure, in particular of
He inside the pores over time (up to 2 years after deposition), and
also after ion irradiation is demonstrated here.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
of Helium-Charged Silicon Coatings
As mentioned in the Introduction section,
one of the major requirements of thin films to be used as solid He
targets is a high He concentration. Adequate choice of deposition
parameters will determine the amount of He incorporated. From our
previous works,12,15 we observed that for the same
deposition pressure condition, high rf power (of 300 W) resulted in
a decrease in He incorporated into the coatings when compared to lower
rf power (21 atom % for 300 W and 34 atom % for 150 W). In this work,
the effect of helium deposition pressure is explored for the selected
power condition allowing the highest He incorporation (i.e., 150 W).

Other authors29−31 have also reported the effects of He partial pressure
in mixtures of He + Ar in dc magnetron sputtering of metals on the
He incorporation into the coatings. However, our approach explores
the possibility of producing porous silicon coatings incorporating
different helium amounts by rf magnetron sputtering at 150 W, using
pure helium as the deposition gas; as summary, Table 1 presents the deposition conditions selected,
and the labels of the coatings.

The morphology of
the coatings deposited by magnetron sputtering
at 150 W in rf, under 2.7, 4.9, and 9.0 Pa of He was first characterized
by SEM-FEG cross-sectional images on coatings deposited on silicon
substrates (see Figure 1). The coatings present a highly porous structure evenly distributed
from the substrate to the surface, similar to the morphology previously
reported by us for coatings deposited under a single pressure condition.

Figure 1 SEM cross-sectional
views of samples: (a) a-Si:He_LP, (b) a-Si:He_MP,
and (c) a-Si:He_HP.

The closed porous structure
can be observed in detail in the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 2, where the pores in bright contrast have
sizes between 2 and 50 nm. Figure 3 displays the pore size distribution corresponding
to the major diameter of an ellipse (best fitted to each pore), for
samples deposited under increasing He deposition pressure. The values
were taken from around 100 pores per sample. At intermediate
pressure, a significant increase in the number of pores with diameters
between 10 and 20 nm is observed with respect to the low-pressure
sample where the majority of pores have sizes around 10 nm. Under
high-pressure conditions, a large number of very small pores (with
major diameters below 10 nm) combined with bigger pores (up to 50
nm) is observed.

The composition
of the samples produced under increasing helium pressure was analyzed
by p-EBS measurements, and the results of He/Si are displayed in Table 1. A significant decrease
in the incorporated He amount is obtained as the deposition pressure
increases. A large amount of He is incorporated when the coatings
are prepared at 2.7 Pa (He/Si = 0.79), which decreases for a working
pressure of 4.9 Pa to a He/Si atomic ratio of 0.49. To understand
this result, we may refer to our previous paper in ref (15), where a relation between
the pore radius and He inside the pores was found: for smaller pore
sizes, higher He pressure and density inside the pores were observed.
Notice that the sample presenting higher He incorporation is also
the sample presenting smaller pores with a narrower pore size distribution.
Therefore, in the case of the sample deposited at 9.0 Pa, a larger
decrease in the He amount in the samples should be expected as bigger
pores are observed; however, the large number of very small pores
seems to compensate for this effect presenting a He/Si atomic ratio
of 0.39.

As an example, the p-EBS spectrum of the sample deposited
at a
higher He pressure is presented in Figure 4. Our results in Table 1 demonstrate experimentally that it is possible
to control the He incorporation into the silicon coatings by controlling
the deposition pressure in rf discharges using only He as the deposition
gas. It is worth mentioning that the presence of contamination elements
was below 2 atom % or negligible.

Figure 4 p-EBS spectrum of sample a-Si:He_HP.

Apart from high He density, homogeneity
versus depth is fundamental
for the use of these coatings as solid He targets. As already mentioned,
the coatings present high porosity from the substrate to the surface,
presenting homogeneous composition as well, as can be observed in
the spectrum in Figure 4. This is a typical spectrum of protons backscattered from the helium-containing
porous samples. The peak of helium appears over the signal corresponding
to the Si substrate. The observed increase in the Si signal and the
small decrease in the He signal are related to variation of the cross-section
with energy and not to any change in the concentration depth profile
of these elements. A constant concentration for both elements has
been used in the simulation.

Reproducibility of He incorporation
and stability over time was
also investigated. For that purpose, a coating deposited under the
same conditions as those for coating a-Si:He_MP was prepared using
a shorter deposition time (in fact, several substrates were coated
at the same time under these preparation conditions). Figure S1a presents the SEM cross-sectional view
of this coating (called a-Si:He_MP(bis)) showing its porosity, which
can be observed in more detail in the TEM micrograph of Figure S1b. A similar pore structure to the one
presented in Figure 2 is observed. Figure 5 shows characteristic p-EBS spectra of the as-prepared a-Si:He_MP(bis)
sample, which clearly shows a narrower He signal, as expected for
this thinner sample.

Figure 5 p-EBS spectra of sample a-Si:He_MP(bis) over time.

To investigate the reproducibility
and stability of the He incorporated
over time, the composition of coatings (a-Si:He_MP(bis)) deposited
at the same time was measured by p-EBS few days and few months after
its deposition and then 2 years later. No particular procedure was
followed to store the samples (storage in ambient air). As can be
appreciated in Figure 5, the spectra of the samples are very similar over time. Although
in Figure 5 a small
difference can be observed regarding the He signal for the sample
measured after 2 years, the He/Si content remains constant within
experimental error (He/Si atomic ratio of ∼0.48). The small
difference that can be observed is related to a small change in thickness
observed in the samples owing to their position in the sample holder.
Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the He amount in the
coating remains unaltered at least 2 years after deposition. This
aspect is relevant for applications where He storage is of interest
and therefore, for the fabrication of the He solid targets. It is
relevant to comment that the spectrum of the sample stored for 2 years
corresponds to the sample that will be used for the cross-section
determination presenting an Au layer, as described in the Experimental (sample called Au/a-Si:He/Si sample).
Further results on the stability of He in the coatings after irradiation
are presented in section a-Si:He Thin-Film Solid
Target for Experiments of Elastic Scattering with Stable Beams.

Scattering of Stable 6Li in a-Si:He Thin Film as
a Test for Studies of Nuclear Properties of Radioactive Nuclei by
Inverse Kinematics
Due to the low ion current achieved by
the radioactive beams compared with stable ones, the total amount
of He in a solid target must be as high as possible in the smallest
thickness to minimize the energy loss and the angular straggling produced
in the sample. In the previous section, the ability to produce thin
films with high He amount homogeneously distributed throughout the
film thickness was demonstrated. However, to fulfill the requirements
of a solid He target for inverse kinematics studies, and to realize
experiments in forward geometry, self-supported thin films are desired.
To explore the possibility of producing a self-supported a-Si:He film
to be used as a solid He target, some considerations must be taken
into account regarding not only the required high He amount, but a
reasonable thickness must also be selected to have a compromise between
low thickness and still to ensure easy handling and mechanical stability
during measurements. In this case, as described in the Experimental, a coating was deposited on a NaCl substrate
under similar deposition conditions to those of sample a-Si:He_MP,
presenting the highest deposition rate, with a thickness of 2300 nm.
After deposition, the a-Si:He coating was floated off in distilled
water and transferred to a holder with an aperture of 10 mm for measurements. Figure 6a presents a SEM
cross-sectional view of the self-supported porous a-Si:He coating
to be used as a target (a-Si:He_MP(self-supp.)).
It is possible to appreciate that the coating has a similar morphology
to those presented by the coatings deposited on silicon substrates.
In Figure 6b, the porous
structure of the target is shown in more detail by TEM cross-section.
The photographs in Figure 6c show a piece of the self-supported thin film on a tweezer
and the film already transferred to the holder for measurements.

Figure 6 Self-supported
a-Si:He thin film: (a) SEM and (b) TEM cross-sectional
views. (c) Down: photograph of the self-supported thin film, up: thin
film mounted on the holder for measurements.

The He content in the coating was first checked by p-EBS. Figure 7 presents the obtained
spectrum for 2.0 MeV proton energy and at detection angle 165°.
The coating is composed of 29 atom % He and 66 atom % Si, and in this
case also, a small oxygen signal is observed (5 atom % O), most probably
due to residual oxygen in the deposition chamber or insufficient sputtering
target cleaning before deposition. Table 2 compares the He incorporation into our a-Si:He_MP
self-supported thin film and into other targets, reported in the literature
prepared by ion implantation. We can see in Table 2 that the total amount of He in our sample
is higher than the quantity obtained by other groups for implanted
samples, also proposed as He targets for inverse kinematics experiments.
Our He/M (M = Si in this work or Al in the case of other authors)
ratio is double the value obtained by Vanderbist et al.19 (0.25) and is much higher than that obtained
by Raabe et al.16 and Ujic et al.32 Relative to the impurity content, in our case
only oxygen, the O/He ratio is lower than 0.22, which is the lowest
value reported in these works.19

To show the potential
of the self-supported a-Si:He coatings prepared
by our methodology, as a target for experiments of scattering of exotic
beams, a preliminary measurement using a similar forward geometry
and a stable beam of 6Li was performed. For the 6Li2+ forward scattering experiment, the self-supported
coating was placed on a holder, as shown in Figure 6c, and bombarded with 6Li2+ ions at 6 MeV. The experimental setup is schematized in Figure 8a, and the scattering
spectrum measured at 30° is presented in Figure 8b. Even if the acquisition system and, consequently,
the spectrum can be improved, this preliminary experiment is used
here as proof of concept to demonstrate the fact that the Li ions
can traverse the sample, and the energies of the dispersed Li, or
recoiled ions, are the ones predicted by kinematics. Nevertheless,
the results presented here represent a novel approach for the production
of self-supported coatings as solid He targets by magnetron sputtering.
Further experiments with stable beams are being proposed to improve
the quality of the spectra, and these preliminary studies serve as
a verification test of our self-supported samples for measurements
with radioactive beams.

a-Si:He Thin-Film Solid Target for Experiments of Elastic Scattering
with Stable Beams
The excitation functions for the direct
scattering process He(p,p)He between 110 and 165° are presented
in Figure 9 (obtained
values are also presented in Table S1),
as obtained from experiments with our Au/a-Si:He/Si solid He target.
Data are compared to the reported results in the literature at similar
angles, using He targets of different nature.20,21,23−28 The scattering angles in the cited works are slightly different
from those measured in our work; nevertheless, the data presented
in Figure 9 are compared
with published graphs at a similar scattering angle. In general, our
cross-section curves agree well, both in shape and in absolute values,
with the data available in the literature. As expected, the cross-section
maxima are systematically lower for smaller scattering angles.20

Figure 9 Obtained He(p,p)He elastic scattering cross-section at
scattering
angles of 165° (a), 150° (b), 135° (c), and 110°
(d) as a function of proton energy at our laboratory (with the Au/a-Si:He/Si
sample) in comparison to earlier data published at similar angles.

For 165, 150, and 135°, the
curves increase swiftly from 0.6
until a broad maximum is reached around an energy of 2.2 MeV, and
after this maximum, cross-sections decrease with increasing energy.
Attending to the value of the maximum resonance, we observe that data
at 165° differ by less than 2% from the data presented by Lu21 at this angle, and by less than 5% in the absolute
value between the values obtained by Miller24 at 164° and the ones presented by Kraus25 at 163°. The data obtained at 150° are 2% higher
than the values presented by Cai27 at 151°
and 10% higher than those by Kraus25 at
150°. At 135°, our values are 10% higher than the data obtained
by Barnard26 and Kraus25 at 135° but differ by less than 2% from the values
by Freier23 at 140°.

In the
case of the data obtained at 110°, between 0.6 and
0.8 MeV, a decrease in the cross-section values is observed with the
increase in energy, followed by a similar behavior of the previous
curves for higher energies. At the cross-section maxima, the difference
is less than 1% compared to data from Miller24 at 112°.

It is worth pointing out again the different
nature of the targets
used, and that the differences found could be due to instabilities
inherent to the nature of the He target used in the previous measurements
as already reported by other authors.20 Even with differences up to 10%, these results point out that our
porous silicon coatings are good candidates to be used a solid He
targets.

Furthermore, it is important to notice the stability
of samples
after irradiation. In Figure 10, we can see the spectra of the sample before and after the
experimental measurements performed with the proton ion beams. The
sample was submitted to a total irradiation fluence of 5 × 1017 particles/cm2, with a dose rate of 5 × 1012 particles/(cm2 s), and no significant differences
in the He content were observed, demonstrating once again the high
stability of the target coatings.

and after the experimental
measurements performed with the proton ion beam. The sample was submitted

Experimental Section
Preparation and Characterization
of Helium-Charged Silicon Coatings
In this work, the effect
of helium deposition pressure on the formation
of closed porosity and He incorporation was investigated. A 2 inch
magnetron gun (ION’X from Thin Film Consulting, Germany) equipped
with a pure Si target (99.999% purity; KurtJ Lesker), placed at 5
cm from the sample holder, was used. The He deposition pressure was
changed from 2.7 to 9.0 Pa for a deposition power of 150 W in rf mode. Table 1 shows the deposition
conditions employed in the preparation and the labels of the coatings.
The coatings were deposited on silicon substrates (100) of 525 μm
thickness. For investigating the reproducibility of the deposition
procedure, several substrates were coated simultaneously.

The
composition of the coatings was evaluated at the 3 MV NEC 9SDH-2 tandem
accelerator of the National Center for Accelerators (CNA, Seville,
Spain) by p-EBS spectrometry, following the method described in ref (22), using a beam of 2.0 MeV
and a passivated implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector set at 165°,
and using the evaluated (SigmaCalc) cross-sections obtained from the
IBANDL database, IAEA base.33,34 The p-EBS spectra were
analyzed with the SIMNRA software.35 The
absolute energy calibration of the tandem accelerator was determined
utilizing resonances of 991.86 keV for reaction 27Al(p,γ)28Si and 2409 keV for reaction 24Mg(p,p′γ)24Mg, and RBS with a thin Au target for energies in the range
4.5–6.2 MeV. After calibration, the beam energy had a precision
better than ±5 keV and energy spread of around 1 keV. The uncertainty
associated with the determination of the absolute concentration of
the elements was less than 5%.

The thickness and morphology
of the samples were examined by scanning
electron microscopy (HITACHI S-4800 SEM-FEG). The samples deposited
on silicon substrates were cleaved and observed without metallization
in cross-sectional views at 1–2 kV.

The microstructure
of the porous films was investigated using the
TEM at the Laboratory of Nanoscopies and Spectroscopies (LANE-ICMS;
Sevilla, Spain), a Philips CM200, and a Tecnai G2 F30 operating at
200 and 300 kV, respectively. The cross-sectional TEM samples were
prepared from the coatings deposited on silicon, by mechanical polishing
and dimple grinding, followed by Ar+ ion milling to electron
transparency. The pore distribution was evaluated from the TEM micrographs
by binarizing them and then using the “Analyze Particle”
function of the ImageJ software.36

Self-Supported
a-Si:He Thin-Film Solid Target for Exotic Nuclei
Experiments
The feasibility of the use of the self-supported
coating as a solid target in inverse kinematics experiments with exotic
nuclei was investigated. Samples were prepared under similar conditions
to those used for sample a-Si:He_MP and characterized as indicated
in the previous section. To obtain self-supported films, the coatings
were grown on NaCl substrates and then floated off in distilled water
and dried in air.

Elastic scattering of 6Li by the
target as a proof of concept to future studies of the 4He(6Li, 6Li)4He cross-section was
performed at the 3 MV tandem accelerator of the CNA using a beam of
6.0 MeV and a PIPS detector set at 30°.

EBS Spectrometry
Experimental
Conditions and Apparatus
To demonstrate
the potential use of the porous silicon coatings as solid helium targets
in nuclear reactions, EBS spectrometry was employed to determine the
elastic scattering cross-sections of protons from helium.

For
this purpose, an Au overlayer of 1.1 × 1016 atoms/cm2 was deposited by evaporation over a porous Si film (prepared
at MP conditions) to prepare an Au/a-Si:He/Si target for the cross-section
measurements. The Au film is important as it is used as an internal
ion dose reference and can also prevent the surface of the silicon
coating from further oxidation. The thickness of this layer was chosen
so that the amount of Au is low enough to avoid an important energy
loss or spread in the target and high enough to obtain an important
signal in the p-EBS spectra. The helium amount in the coating was
checked by p-EBS, as described above in this Experimental.

The 3 MV tandem accelerator at CNA provided the incident
proton
beams used for the cross-section measurements, in the energy range
from 0.6 to 3.0 MeV at 100 keV steps.

A PIPS detector with a
thickness of 500 μm was placed at
the laboratory backward angles between 110 and 165° and subtended
a solid angle of 5 × 10–3 sr, set by a defining
circular aperture of 50 mm2. The angular resolution of
the detector was thus 4.5°. The energy resolution of the detection
system was typically 10 keV for protons. The beam was confined to
a diameter of 1.0 mm before bombarding the target, and the beam current
was limited to less than 8 nA. The beam current was kept sufficiently
low to ensure that pulse pile-up through the detector system deadtime
was minimized and to avoid possible loss of He during the experiment.
The accumulated charge per energy interval was 10 μC measured
using an Ortec 439 digital current integrator. The Au/a-Si:He/Si target
was very stable under bombardment by 8 nA proton beams and no helium
losses were observed during 10 μC runs.

Proton-Helium
Cross-Section Determination
The elastic
scattering differential cross-section of proton-helium in the laboratory
coordinates, using the Au/a-Si:He/Si sample as the target, was calculated
from 1  where  is the calculated Rutherford differential
scattering cross-section for protons on Au.  is the incident proton energy, and ΔEAu and ΔESi are the energy loss of protons in the Au and Si films, respectively.
The signal peak area ratio AHe/AAu was determined from the measured spectrum.
The ratio (Nt)Au/(Nt)He (N = atom density, t =
layer thickness) was determined by using the areal density value for
(Nt)He and (Nt)Au from the above-mentioned p-EBS spectra of the sample. All Rutherford
scattering cross-sections used here were corrected for electron screening
effects.37

The accuracy of the proton
differential elastic scattering cross-sections measured here is limited
by the uncertainties in all parameters used in eq 1. The statistical uncertainties of AAu and AHe come
from the determination of Au and He peak areas and the background
subtraction, and they are typically 1−2% for Au and 1−9%
for He (depending on the energy used in the measurement). These values
could be improved using a different experimental setup, as for example
an E – ΔE telescope
detection system that avoids the uncertainties from the background
subtraction. The uncertainties from measuring the areal density (Nt)Au and (Nt)He are
less than 3%. As the energy straggling is negligible, its effect on
the accuracy of cross-section measurements has not been accounted
for. Thus, the total uncertainty associated with the measured cross-section
is between 4 and 10%.

The stability of He content throughout
the experiment was checked.
p-EBS measurements, using 2.0 MeV, at both the beginning and the end
of the experiments were performed.

Conclusions
In
this work, we have demonstrated the possibility of controlling
the He amount in amorphous Si:He coatings with closed porosity by
controlling the deposition pressure. The coatings deposited by the
presented methodology are good candidates to be used as solid He targets
as a high He amount is incorporated into the film homogeneously distributed
throughout the film thickness. The versatility of magnetron sputtering
and the reproducibility of the results make this a very promising
methodology for extended target production. Moreover, the coatings
proved to be stable in time, at least 2 years after deposition and
after irradiation.

A strategy to produce self-supported a-Si:He
coatings with high
He amount is presented here for the first time. Preliminary results
in forward geometry using a 6Li beam are used here as a
proof of concept to show that the self-supported coatings can be used
as alternative He solid targets for experiments with radioactive beams.

The validation of the a-Si:He porous coatings as solid He targets
is further demonstrated by the determination of the differential cross-section
for the elastic scattering of proton-helium in the energy range from
0.6 to 3.0 MeV at laboratory angles from 110 to 165°. In general,
our results are consistent, both in shape and absolute values, with
the data available in the literature for He targets of different nature
(gas, implanted, and coatings).
