Intracellular thiols (e.g., cysteine,
homocysteine, and glutathione)
play critical roles in biological functions. Glutathione is the most
abundant cellular thiol which is important for preserving redox homeostasis
in biosystems. Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of responsive
photonic crystals (RPCs) for selective detection of thiol-containing
biomolecules through the combination of self-assembly of monodisperse
carbon-encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs)
and in situ photopolymerization. Typically, the polyacrylamide-based
PCs were prepared by a cross-linking agent containing disulfide bonds.
Interestingly, the specific chemical reaction between the disulfide
bonds and thiol-containing biomolecules leads to the decrease of the
cross-linking degree for the RPCs, triggering the swelling of the
hydrogel and increase of the NP lattice spacing. The reduced glutathione
(10–6 to 10–2 mol/L) can be determined
by measuring the diffracted wavelength or visually observing the structural
color change. Moreover, the RPCs can be used to detect different kinds
of thiol-containing biomolecules by a simple color variation due to
different reaction rates between disulfide bonds and different thiol-containing
biomolecules. This study provides a facile yet effective strategy
for visualized determination of the thiol-containing biomolecules.

1 Introduction
Intracellular biothiols
[e.g., cysteine (CYS), homocysteine (HCY),
and glutathione (GSH)] play vital roles in physiological and pathological
processes.1 GSH is the most abundant nonprotein
thiol and is important to maintain the optimum redox status of biosystems.
For example, GSH protects cellular functions by removing reactive
oxygen species through a reversible redox process. The ratio of reduced
GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSH) is a pivotal indicator for monitoring
the oxidative stress and the cellular redox environment inside the
cells.2 More importantly, abnormal levels
of GSH have been reported to be a diagnostic indicator for various
diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, cardiovascular
disease, and others.3 Therefore, the sensitive
and efficient biothiol detection has attracted great attention over
the past decades.

Recently, the contents of biothiols in biological
samples can be
determined by various means, including fluorescence spectroscopy,4 circular dichroism spectroscopy,5 electrochemical methods,6,7 liquid chromatography,8 colorimetry,9 surface-enhanced
Raman scattering,10,11 and enzymatic recycling assay.12 Although various techniques have achieved good
results, they often suffer from time-consuming, trained personnel,
expensive instrumentation, or inconvenience, limiting their practical
applications. Therefore, it still remains a big challenge to develop
a facile strategy for biothiol detection in a sensitive, low-cost,
and efficient manner.

Responsive photonic crystals (RPCs) are
materials with periodically
refractive indices. The photonic band gaps of RPCs can be tuned by
the hydrogel swelling and deswelling in response to environmental
variation, such as temperature,13 electric
field,14 light,15 metal ions,16 organic solvent,17 pH,18 biomolecules,19−25 and others. The structural color provides an easy yet efficient
method to indicate the lattice spacing of PCs and can be visually
discerned by the naked eyes. However, physically RPCs do not have
better selectivity because the photonic band gaps of physically RPCs
can be altered by different kinds of organic solvents or biomolecules.
Based on the specific reaction, the photonic band gaps of chemically
RPCs cannot be altered by the organic solvents or biomolecules. Therefore,
chemically RPCs have better selectivity than physically RPCs.

Herein, we demonstrated the fabrication of disulfide-based RPCs
that can react with reduced GSH, triggering a diffraction wavelength
shift. The RPCs were prepared using a cross-linking agent containing
disulfide bonds by the combination of self-assembly of carbon-encapsulated
magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) and in situ photopolymerization. The
reaction between disulfide bonds and GSH decreases the cross-linking
degree of hydrogel, which triggers the swelling of the hydrogel and
increase of the magnetic NPs spacing. Based on the variation of the
cross-linking degree in the RPCs under different GSH concentrations,
the RPCs can be used to detect the concentration of GSH by measuring
the diffracted wavelength or visually observing structural color variation.
Moreover, different kinds of thiol-containing biomolecules can be
detected by a simple color change due to different reaction rates.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Fabrication of RPCs
Monodispersed
carbon-encapsulated Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized
by the one-step solvothermal method.26 In Figure 1a, the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image for Fe3O4 NPs sample
shows that the sample is composed of monodisperse carbon-encapsulated
Fe3O4 NPs with a diameter of 130 ± 5 nm.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in the inset of Figure 1a indicates that
the Fe3O4 NPs have an obvious shell structure
and are composed of numerous iron oxide nanocrystals. In our previous
reports, we have shown that the Fe3O4 NPs can
form one-dimensional (1D) chain structure under external magnetic
field by the electrostatic repulsive and magnetic forces between Fe3O4 NPs.27,28 The RPCs film was prepared
by adding acrylamide (AM), cross-linker N,N′-cystaminebis(acrylamide) (CBIS), and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS). The periodically
ordered structures of Fe3O4 NPs can be immobilized
in the hydrogels by self-assembly of Fe3O4 NPs
and UV photo-polymerization (Figure 1b). As shown in Figure 1c,d, the RPCs display a vivid green color, which results
from the strong diffraction of visible light by the periodic structures.
The reflection peak of the RPCs was recorded and shown in Figure 1d. The position of
the maximum reflection peak of the RPCs follows the Bragg’s
law 1  where neff is
the effective refractive index of the material, λ is the diffraction
wavelength, and d is the center-to-center spacing
of colloidal particles. Thus, the diffraction wavelength and resulting
structural color can be changed by controlling the lattice spacing
of the NPs in the RPCs.

2.2 RPC-Based
GSH Sensing
The disulfide
bond cross-linked RPCs have the stable chemical properties in the
phosphate buffered solution (PBS, pH = 6.8). Structural color of the
hydrogels does not change and has a diffraction peak at 538 nm within
6 months. The disulfide bond is susceptible to the disulfide–thiol
exchange reaction.4 Based on the specific
reaction, the disulfide bond cross-linked RPCs were fabricated and
used to detect GSH through the change of structural color. As shown
in Figure 3, when being
exposed to the GSH solution, the disulfide bond in the RPCs can generate
two thiols, and the cross-linking degree was thus decreased, triggering
the swelling of the hydrogels and increase of NPs spacing. After the
RPCs film was added into different concentrations of GSH solution
respectively for 20 h, the structural color of the RPCs film changed
from green to yellow and then red gradually as the GSH concentration
increases from 10–6 to 10–2 mol/L,
as indicated in Figure 2. Meanwhile, the corresponding
reflection peak shows an obvious red shift from 538 to 658 nm. The
reaction process was under an N2 atmosphere in order to
prevent the oxidization of GSH. Generally, the intracellular GSH concentration
in the human body will be in a range of 1–10 mM/L.29,30 Interestingly, the lowest GSH concentration of detection based on
the RPCs can be 1 μM through the structural color change with
17 nm red shift. To investigate the GSH response speed, the RPCs film
was immersed in 10–2 mol/L GSH solutions in a real-time
manner (Figure 4).
The reflection peak shows a gradual red shift within 20 h, and 16
nm shift of diffraction wavelength can be observed after 1 h. While
the reflection peak shows 17 nm red shift of diffraction wavelength
after 20 h under 10–6 mol/L GSH stimulus (Figure 2). The diffraction
wavelength shift can be attributed to the gradual decrease of cross-linking
degree with the continuous reaction. The factors of influencing reaction
rate are the kinetics constant, concentration of the analyte, and
porosity of RPCs.31,32 As increasing the enough reaction
time, the photonic crystal hydrogels shows an obvious structural color
change and a large shift of reflection peak. Therefore, the choice
of reaction time (20 h) contributes to the naked eye detection of
RPCs.

of the RPCs at a fixed detection angle (90°) treated in the aqueous
solution containing glutathione of (a) 0 mol/L, (b) 10–6 mol/L, (c) 10–5 mol/L, (d) 10–4 mol/L, (e) 10–3 mol/L, and (f) 10–2 mol/L for 20 h, then placed in deionized water (pH = 6.8). The scale
bar in (f) applies to the others.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration showing the change of lattice spacing and
the reaction in the RPCs in the aqueous solution containing GSH. The
volume of RPCs expands after being treated with GSH, causing the increase
of the lattice spacing of the NPs and the corresponding red shift
of the reflection peak.

Figure 4 Reflection spectra of the RPCs treated in the aqueous solution
containing 10–2 mol/L GSH for different durations
at a fixed detection angle (90°).

Furthermore, the RPCs can be used for detecting the other
types
of thiol-containing biomolecules (Figure 5). For example, the reflection peak of RPCs
shifted from 538 to 592 nm after immersing in CYS solution (10–3 mol/L) for 20 h. After reaction with GSH (10–3 mol/L), the reflection peak of RPCs shifted from
538 to 621 nm. Furthermore, the reflection peak of RPCs shifted from
538 to 602 nm after the reaction with HCY (10–3 mol/L). Figure 5f displays the evolution
of the diffraction wavelength with the reaction. Based on the variability
of reaction rate between disulfide bonds and different thiol-containing
biomolecules,32 the cross-linking degree
of RPCs decreased differently after the reaction with GSH, CYS, or
HCY solution, respectively, causing the hydrogels to swell and the
lattice spacing to increase differently. Therefore, the RPCs can be
used to differentiate thiol-containing biomolecules through the structural
color change.

spectra

(d) applies to the others. (f) Diffraction wavelength of the RPCs
treated in the aqueous solution containing 10–3 mol/L
GSH, CYS, or HCY for different durations.

2.3 Selectivity of RPCs
Because of different
interactions between the polymer and molecules, the diffraction wavelength
of physically RPCs can be shifted to different positions when being
immersed in the different solutions.17 Usually,
physical interaction-based RPCs do not have better selectivity because
the solvent or biomolecules can affect the photonic stop band. While
the chemical structure of reactive PCs changes after reacting with
analyte molecules, and the other disturbed solvent or biomolecules
can be removed after immersing PC films to the deionized water. Therefore,
chemical PCs have better selectivity than physical PCs. The selectivity
of the RPCs is shown in Figure 6. In our case, the RPCs were respectively dipped in the aqueous
solution of 10–3 mol/L bovine serum albumin (BSA),
glycine, lysine, glutamine, urea, glucose, or a mixture of urea, glucose,
and BSA for 20 h and then immersed to the deionized water. No significant
diffraction wavelength shift was observed upon exposure to nonthiol
amino acids, carbohydrates, protein, and others. This indicated that
the cross-linking degree and chemical composition of RPCs were not
changed and the RPCs do not react with compounds containing hydroxy,
carboxyl, amidogen groups, and others. Based on the chemical reaction,
the RPCs show specific GSH-recognition and the other biomolecules
will not affect the photonic stop band. The regeneration of the described
RPCs is examined in Figure 7. After reacting with 10–3 mol/L GSH for
20 h, the RPCs were dipped in the PBS solution at an O2 atmosphere for 10 h. However, the position of reflection peak did
not change. This demonstrates that the RPCs are irreversible and cannot
form the disulfide bond again under the O2 atmosphere.

BSA, glycine, lysine, glutamine, urea, glucose, or a mixture of glucose,
urea, and BSA for 20 h, respectively.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated
a facile yet efficient strategy
for the fabrication of RPCs for thiol-containing biomolecules sensing
through the rapid self-assembly of magnetic NPs and in situ photopolymerization.
Based on the specific reaction between the disulfide bond in the hydrogels
and thiol-containing biomolecules, the RPCs can be used to selectively
detect thiol-containing biomolecules concentration by the change of
structural color. Moreover, RPCs can be used to differentiate thiol-containing
biomolecules by a simple color change. This approach provides a new
opportunity for the preparation of visualized chemosensors for thiol-containing
biomolecule sensing.

4.2 Synthesis
of Monodisperse Carbon-Encapsulated
Fe3O4 NPs
Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized by a previously reported procedure.26 First, ferrocene (0.35 g) was added into acetone
(35 mL) to form a transparent solution. Then, H2O2 solution (1.9 mL) was dropped slowly to the solution and stirred
for 25 min. Subsequently, the mixture was placed into a stainless
steel autoclave and heated to 200 °C. After 72 h, the stainless
steel autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the products were
then washed for three times using acetone and dried at 65 °C
in a vacuum oven for 3 h.

4.3 Preparation of RPCs
Typically, 0.05
g of AM, 0.0001 g of BIS, and 0.0015 g of CBIS were added in 0.2 mL
of ethylene glycol. It generated a transparent solution for 10 min
by sonication. Then, 0.009 g of the as-prepared Fe3O4 NPs (diameter: 130 ± 5 nm) was added to the above solution,
followed by sonication for ∼15 min. Subsequently, the suspension
was placed between two clean glass slides to form a green film under
external magnetic field. Finally, the green films were polymerized
for ∼15 min under UV irradiation and immersed in deionized
water for removing ethylene glycol.

voltage of 200 kV. A Canon IXUS 105 digital camera was used to get
photographs of the RPCs films. Reflection spectral characterizations
of the RPCs were collected by a fiber optic spectrometer (USB4000,
Ocean Optics).
