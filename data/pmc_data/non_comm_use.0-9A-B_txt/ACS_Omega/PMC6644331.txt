Herein, the methanol
conversion to aromatic hydrocarbons was studied
over a new family of mesoporous low-silica HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 11) catalysts
in a fixed-bed tubular reactor under ambient pressure at 375 °C,
feeding with weight hourly space velocity of 2 h–1. The catalysts were prepared in the absence and presence of Zn and
Fe in both alkaline and neutral aqueous solutions, characterized by
using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, temperature programmed
desorption of ammonia, N2 adsorption/desorption, thermogravimetric
analysis, Fourier-transform infrared, transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy and FE-SEM/energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy techniques. The [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
catalyst exhibited novel selectivity for aromatics (>86 wt %),
specifically
for m and p-xylenes (44.7 wt %)
alongside 0.1 wt % for benzene.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, aromatic hydrocarbons are significant chemical intermediates
in fine chemical industries, exhibiting sharp commercial demands.1,2 Reforming of petroleum fraction aromatic hydrocarbons is the central
source of aromatics, whereas working on new nonpetroleum substitute
is industrially crucial.3−5 During recent decades, the research
on the role of solid acid catalysts in methanol conversion to aromatics
(MTA) process has fascinated both scientists and industrial organization,
as methanol is supplied from different resources as syngas, natural
gas, coal, biomass, and any other carbon-based gasifiable feedstock.2,6−8

As one of the most practical choices, ZSM-5
zeolites enjoy having
acidic sites, shape-selectivity, high surface area, and adaptability
to an extensive assortment of products, namely from olefin to aromatics.9,10 From the morphological point of view, two kinds of pores, shaped
by 10-membered oxygen rings could be found in the ZSM-5 structure.11 The presence of these types of pores together
with the “zigzag pores” interconnecting them is crucial
for the formation of desirable compounds during the MTA process.12 Meanwhile, one of the significant limitations
for the application of this catalyst is the diffusion of the compounds
within the pores. Thus, the modifications of ZSM-5 catalyst could
give rise to subsequent enhancement of the pore diffusion properties
as well as upgrading of the catalyst impact on the target process.12 A well-known method to achieve this goal is
the desilication of ZSM-5 by employing NaOH, which results in formation
of the mesoporous catalysts.13−18 Recently, the alkali treatment was found as a fascinating approach
for developing of mesoporous morphology from the corresponding microporous
ZSM-5 zeolites.12,17 Mochizuki et al. applied the
alkali treatment method by using different concentrations of NaOH
solution in desilication of ZSM-5.19 They
found several crystal sizes with different external surface areas,
wherein the deactivation of the catalyst was attributed to the presence
of Lewis-type acidic sites generated owing to employing high concentration
of NaOH. In another experiment, Bjørgen et al.20 reformed ZSM-5 crystals by employing alkali-treatment method
with NaOH. They reported that the modification made on ZSM-5 resulted
in lifting of the diffusion restrictions, wherein the selectivity
of the ZSM-5 for the gasoline cut was promoted by a factor of 1.7.

Meanwhile, the existence of metal
atom sites along with the acidic sites in the structure of ZSM-5 are
two efficient morphological factors influencing on the catalyst activity.
For instance, significant enhancement in methanol conversion to gasoline
has been reported over ZSM-5 zeolite, incorporated with some metal
species.21 Freeman et al.22 investigated the effect of various loadings of Ga2O3 on ZSM-5 in catalysis of the methanol-to-gasoline process.
Their observations indicated on the enhancement of the conversion
of methanol over the promoted ZSM-5 catalyst, whereby the catalyst
stability was also significantly guaranteed against deactivation.
In another report, Zaidi and Pant23 reported
the increase in the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons, employing ZSM-5
co-impregnation with ZnO and CuO.

The influence of various Si/Al
ratios in ZSM-5 catalysts has also
been considered in several reports. For instance, Mn-ZSM-5 catalyst
with Si/Al = 200 represented the highest reported propylene selectivity.24 As another example, the Zn-ZSM-5 catalyst with
Si/Al = 27 displayed improved catalytic stability in 1-hexene aromatization,25 while in another report Fe/Mo/impregnated ZSM-5
exhibited higher benzene yield, compared with Mo catalyst in methane
dehydroaromatization.26 In the latter report,
Mo/ZSM-5 was promoted with Fe and Zn, displayed better catalyst stability
in terms of the coke formation. Fila et al. reported better resistance
of Co/Mo/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 30) catalyst toward deactivation by coke formation.27 Higher total olefins (80%) selectivity and propylene
selectivity (51%) were also found in a methanol-to-olefin process
catalyzed in the presence of Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst with Si/Al = 200.24 By employing Si/Al = 13, Zhao et al.28 reported remarkable improvement in stability
of Pt-modified nanoscale HZSM-5 catalysts. Moreover, Li et al.29 showed that the catalyst lifetime improvement
in methanol conversion (MTO) process, up to 14 days after postmodification
of ZSM-5 with Ga. On the other hand, some reports unveiled that the
yield of hydrocarbon production could be improved in methanol conversion
over ZSM-5 zeolite, upgraded with some metal species such as Zn,21,30 Ga,29 and Fe.24,31 Jiao et al. showed that the Fe-modified HZSM-5 catalyst affected
on the MTO process.32 They reported loading
of HZSM-5 with Fe from 0.18 to 1.75% resulted in increase of the weak
acid sites. They found a maximum of total acid site on HZSM-5 at the
Fe loading up to 0.35%.32

Some reports
unveiled that the yield of aromatic hydrocarbons production
in MTA was improved in the presence of the upgraded HZSM-5 zeolite
with some metal species.4,33,34 As an effective element in promoting the methanol-to-hydrocarbons
process, zinc is the most attractive element.30 Fattahi et al. represented 77 wt % production of aromatics using
a Zn-impregnated (0.75 wt %) zeolite having a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 54. Then, the reaction was accomplished
at 370 °C and ambient pressure by employing weight hourly space
velocity (WHSV) equal to 4 h–1.18 The selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons was also improved
from 36.2 to 45.8% at 390 °C and WHSV of 3.2 h–1, applying of Zn on the ZSM-5 crystals having Si/Al = 40 ratio.30 Another report17 dealt
with the improvement of BTX yield (up to 48%) over a nanosize [Zn,Al]-HZSM-5
zeolite, wherein the catalytic stability decreased to 32% after 160
h on stream of methanol conversion at 437 °C and WHSV of 0.8
h–1. Besides, Ghavipour et al.10 studied temperature dependence (375, 425, and 475 °C)
of methanol dehydration over a HZSM-5 catalyst with SiO2/Al2O3 = 31.5, modified under alkali condition
under WHSV of 5 h–1. Then, Yang et al.4 applied alkali-modified 0.8Zn-HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 59) zeolite in the MTA reaction
to boost the aromatic yield from 41.4 to 55.3%. The catalyst also
demonstrated more catalyst stability at T = 400 °C
and WHSV = 2.5 h–1. Besides, Ni et al.21 observed the mesoporous morphology changing
of ZSM-5 catalyst under NaOH treatment accompanied by Zn impregnation.

Taking into account the above-mentioned results, the idea of promoting
low-Si/Al zeolites with appropriate metal ions was found to be of
commercial importance to prepare cheaper catalyst together with more
efficient product distribution in MTA process.18,35−39 For instance, researchers have synthesized a series of desilicated,
Ga-impregnated, and low-Si/Al HZSM-5 catalysts, tested in aromatization
of methanol at high temperatures, causing high aromatic yields alongside
lengthy lifetime.40

Moreover, Behbahani
and Mehr41 observed
the impregnation of ZSM-5 with strontium enhanced 2% in production
of aromatics. In another report, the alternation of the reactivity
of Brønsted acid sites (BASs) on aluminosilicate lattice of HZSM-5
as a result of variation in Si/Al ratio was explored.42 They showed the development of the lattice and BASs in
low Si/Al ratio (Si/Al = 11) zeolites as a result of substitution
of the Al groups. The aforesaid substitution was due to increase of
polarization in the nearest-neighbor T-sites, whereby both the proton-transfer
and the protonated-product formation processes were improved.42

Very recently, Jiang et al.43 demonstrated
high selectivity of olefins in the MTO process in terms of C2–C4 over the use of nanosized ZSM-5 zeolites catalysts
([Fe,Al]NZ5), owing to the moderate acidity alongside the observed
improvement in diffusion performance. They also indicated that impregnation
of the catalyst with Fe could give rise to increase in the number
of the BASs, leading to inhibit the olefin cycle and promote the aromatic
cycle.

In this research, we undertook the preparation of alkali-modified
low-Si [Fe, Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolite to develop a new catalyst to boost
the best results reported for the catalytic performance of the modified
HZSM-5 in the MTA process. The main aim of this work is to accomplish
a systematic and comparative study of simultaneous alkali treatment
as well as the best known postmodification of a low-Si/Al HZSM-5 catalyst
by Fe and Zn in order to monitor the production of the aromatics in
the MTA process.

In the course of the present research, the
Taguchi method44 was applied to obtain
the best results by employing
the minimum number of the required experiments. The Taguchi method
has been a persuasive tool to facilitate research and development
in order to attain prompt high quality products and productivity at
reasonable costs.45 The method covers a
logical application of design and analysis of experiments in order
for designing and improving the product quality. In the present study,
based on the Taguchi method, the activity HZSM-5 catalyst in the MTA
process was optimized using a program consisted of 2 levels and 5
factors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst
Characterization
Figure S1 shows
the Fourier-transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra of HZSM-5, alk-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5,
[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5 and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5
catalysts in 400–4000 cm–1. The spectra represented
typical bands at ∼450 cm–1 for the bending
vibrations of the primary tetrahedral building units, T–O,
wherein the central atom (T) was usually either a silicon or aluminum
atom. The other band at ∼550 cm–1 was assigned
to double five-member rings in SiO4 and AlO4 units in a HZSM-5 structure. Besides, typical symmetric and asymmetric
modes of vibrations of SiOSi for these bands were detected at 740–860
and 1040–1210 cm–1. Another recorded band
at 1620 cm–1 together with the other broad band
at 3450 cm–1 was assigned to physically absorbed
water and the interconnecting OH groups, respectively, akin to the
other reports.20,46,47

Furthermore, an assortment of OH groups was found in the IR
spectra at 3000–3800 cm–1, confirmed on the
Si–OH functional groups within the sample. As shown in Figure S1, all the catalysts represented the
band at ∼3600 cm–1, indicating on Si–OH–Al
and Al–OH groups, respectively.43 The bands at 3740 cm–1 were also attributed to
the external Si–OH.48,49

Moreover, Figure 1 represents the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns for the catalysts.

[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5, and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5
zeolites.

Practically, five diffraction
bands (2θ = 8.1°, 8.9°,
23.1°, 23.3°, and 23.8°) were found in the XRD patterns
shown in Figure 1,
assigned to the orthorhombic structure of HZSM-5.11 As represented in Figure 1, modification of zeolite structure, made no alternation
in the peak position of the XRD graphs nor change in the initial structure
of the HZSM-5, as expected for the low-metal-loaded (below 1 wt %)
HZSM-5 samples. All seven catalysts exhibited related diffraction
patterns, specifying that the original crystal structure of HZSM-5
zeolite was well-preserved during the alkaline treatments, corresponding
to the previous report.4 Although all of
the catalysts exhibited high crystallinity (Table 1), but subsequent impregnation of the parent
catalyst led to relatively low crystallinity, as a result of the effect
of the desilication process on the decrease of the crystallinity of
HZSM-5 zeolite.50 Incidentally, high dispersion
of Fe and Zn species on HZSM-5 zeolite was concluded in the absence
of any evidence for the formation of a new phase in the XRD patterns
in Figure 1.

g Particle size estimated by Scherer’s

h The intensity
fraction for a portion
of the XRD pattern for the sample was considered with respect to the
intensity of the corresponding portion in the reference HZSM-5 pattern
(ASTM D5758-01), which was applied as XRD relative crystallinity.

Furthermore, the HZSM-5 zeolite
represented relatively high crystallinity
among the synthesized samples (Table 1).

Table 1 also demonstrates
that the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area (SBET) as well as the total pore volume (Vtotal) of the HZSM-5 zeolite samples, while
in general the alkali treatment alongside impregnation with Zn and
Fe on the HZSM-5 gave rise to remarkable increase in the corresponding
effective surface area (SMeso). Basically,
higher surface area and pore volumes for the alkali-treated samples
could be observed as a result of the desilication treatment, generating
more mesopores.

On the other hand, Table 1 represents a significant increase in VMeso which was observed in conjunction with
decrease in VMicro. Evidently, the observed
growth in the
number of mesopores was occurred on the expense of the decrease in
the corresponding micropore population. In conclusion, both of alkali
treatments and metal impregnation on the parent ZSM-5 generally have
promoted the key surface and catalytic factors, namely SBET, SMeso, and VTotal. Taking into account the abovementioned conclusions,
a prominent catalytic effect for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 with regard
to the parent HZSM-5 zeolite was expected. The textural parameters
for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, however, were denoted on
the reduced values for SBET as well as Vtotal with respect to 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5 zeolite.
Previously, some researchers endorsed the phenomenon of blockage of
pores by metallic species to serve as the reducing factor in SBET and Vtotal.9,51,52

The field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) micrograph
of the catalyst samples in Figure 2 revealed the morphology of (a) HZSM-5, (b) alk-HZSM-5,

(f) [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5, and (g) [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolites.

and (g) [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolites.

Figure 2 displays
a spongelike for these samples very similar to the recently reported
morphology for HZSM-5 and 0.8Zn-HZSM-5.30,31 In order to
display the distribution of the elements over the catalyst, energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) dot-mapping analysis was shown
in Figure S2, confirming on their perfect
homogeneous distribution on the samples. Besides, Figure 3 exhibits transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of the catalysts.

Figure 3 TEM images of (a) HZSM-5,
(b) alk-HZSM-5, (c) 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5,
and (d) [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 zeolites. The marked yellow circles
signify the observed changes.

As shown in Figure 3a, the HZSM-5 catalyst exhibits irregular and spherical-like
morphology.
The TEM image in Figure 3b indicates that the HZSM-5 zeolite morphology undergoes intracrystalline
mesoporosity, owing to desilication during the alkali treatment. Meanwhile,
because of the alkali treatment, the etched holes and pores are observable
in Figure 3b, suggesting
a partial deterioration of external surface of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite.
Because the XRD method demonstrated no indication on the formation
of new phases pertaining to Fe and Zn compounds on the HZSM-5 due
to the low loading of the metals, TEM micrographs were used to monitor
any new morphological changes on the surface of 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5 and
[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 zeolites (Figure 3c,d), resulted from the corresponding modification
on the precursor zeolite. As Fe and Zn oxides have a higher average
molecular weight than the other components on the parent HZSM-5 zeolite,
they should display darker contrast in the bright-field images compared
to the support. As shown in Figure 3d several new phases, ranging from 30 to 200 nm, can
be seen at the edges of the HZSM-5 crystals, attributable to new phases
on the HZSM-5 support.

To investigate surface structure of the
samples in more detail,
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were inspected (Figure 4).

Figure 4 N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms for the HZSM-5, alk-HZSM-5,
0.8Zn-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5,
and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolites.

The isotherms of the catalysts in Figure 4 represented an adsorption isotherm type
IV. Furthermore, at relatively high pressures (P/P0 > 0.5) in Figure 4, restricted gas uptake during capillary
condensation in mesopores provided type IV isotherms together with
the observed H4 hysteresis loops specified narrow ink-bottle-type
pores with irregular shapes.53 In these
experiments, at relative low pressures, that is P/P0 < 0.2 for HZSM-5, <0.35 for
0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5, <0.34 for alk-HZSM-5, <0.36 for 0.8Zn-HZSM-5,
<0.24 for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, <0.35 for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5,
and <0.33 for [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolites, the isotherms indicated
on the formation of Langmuir-type monolayer adsorption, occurred as
a result of the limiting gas uptake by the available micropores. The
variation of the utmost monolayer P/P0 values for these samples at low pressures, however,
represents the following order:  

If one takes the extent of
monolayer formation in Figure 4 (at the abovementioned P/P0 values) as an indication
of surface area, the aforesaid order suggested that alkali treatment
of the parent HZSM-5 (3.1 mmol g–1) resulted in
a significant surface enlargement (4.4 mmol g–1 for
0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5), wherein subsequent metal impregnations served as
a fair decreasing factor for surface area (3.7 mmol g–1 for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5). These evidence led us to propose
that the impregnation process had a somehow negative effect on the
monolayer adsorption of [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5. However, the remarkable
change in the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms observed
for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 zeolite could be attributed to the developed
mesoporosity on the zeolite during the alkali treatment process.

Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution
(PSD) curves are demonstrated in Figure 5.

Figure 5 BJH PSD curves of the HZSM-5, alk-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-HZSM-5,
0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5,
[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5, and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5
zeolites; the presentation of the PSD at: (a) <6, (b) 30–40
nm, and (c) the complete range.

The meso-PSD was obtained from the adsorption isotherm by
means
of the BJH method. The BJH PSDs of HZSM-5 zeolite was concentrated
at only 2.5–6 nm, while corresponding values for alk-HZSM-5
zeolite encompass a large population of pores at 1.5–10 nm
range, a low population of medium-size pores at ∼4 nm, and
a new very low population of large pore centered at a 35 nm (Figure 6a,b). Impregnation
of both HZSM-5 as well as alkali-HZSM-5 with Zn afforded the pore-size
distributions very similar to alk-HZSM-5 zeolite for HZSM-5, while
under the same condition, corresponding small pores at 2.5–6
nm in alk-ZSM-5 were completely substituted with the pores with ∼4
and ∼35 nm. Moreover, the co-impregnation of 0.8Zn-HZSM-5 with
Fe did not significantly altered the pore-size distribution, even
at high concentration of Fe, comparing the PSD curves for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5
and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolites in Figures 5a and 6b. The co-impregnation
of 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5 with Fe, however, resulted in a sensible collapsing
of small-size pores, that is ∼4 nm (see Figure 5b), to large-size pores at 30–40 nm.
It means that the co-impregnation of 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5 with Fe could
afford more large-size pores, maybe by facilitation of more Si–O–Si
bond cleavage. Conclusively, any catalytic changes for the alkali-treated
HZSM-5 samples could be described in terms of newly formed 4 nm pores.

Figure 6 NH3-TPD profiles for the HZSM-5, alk-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-HZSM-5,
0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5,
and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 zeolites.

To investigate the effect of the strength and distribution
of different
acid sites on the catalysts, temperature-programmed desorption of
ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out. Corresponding
NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Figure 6.

These profiles represented the TPD
desorption peaks at two different
temperature ranges consisting of 215–280 and 470–540
°C, designated to the chemical desorption of NH3 from
weak and strong acidic sites, respectively.25 As evident from Figure 6, each profile could be deconvoluted to two Gaussian distributions.
Primarily, comparison of these profiles suggested that the parent
HZSM-5 had rather more acid site combined with stronger acid character
(i.e. higher desorption temperature). Then, because of the remarkable
decrease in acid-site concentration (Figure 6), the NH3-TPD results showed
that the alkali treatment with NaOH in alk-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5,
and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 zeolites resulted in preferential desilication
of the parent HZSM-5. Basically, removal of some Si atoms from the
zeolite framework gave rise to destruction of the zeolite structure
with subsequent loss of some acid sites.21 Similarly, Yang et al.4 attributed the
growing number of weak acid sites on H–Zn/ZSM-5 to the drop
in the number of the strong acid sites at 430 °C. They showed
that the alkali treatment and Zn incorporation could lessen the coke
formation process on the zeolite.

Furthermore, in Table 2, the density of the acid site
on the catalysts was calculated
from the peak areas shown in Figure 6.

The NH3-TPD results were
collected in Table 2 showed that total acid sites
of the parent zeolite significantly decreased during the impregnation
of alk-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5, and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 zeolites,
establishing the increase in total acid sites with metal incorporation.
Furthermore, the parent HZSM-5 exhibited relatively more acid sites
(2.302 mmol NH3 g–1) than 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5
and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5. Where Zn and Fe were incorporated, both
bands were thermally enlarged, decreasing in the intensity of the
strong acid band (region II). Meanwhile, the acid site densities of
catalysts were reduced from 1.199 in HZSM-5 to 0.583 in 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5
and 0.511 mmol NH3 g–1 in [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
in region II. In Conclusion, the integration
of Zn and Fe species into alk-HZSM-5 zeolite resulted in reduction
of the strong acid sites, meaning that the acid character could be
less important factor than the pore-size consideration in our chemically
treated ZSM-5 samples for describing any observable catalytic differences.

Moreover, Figure S3 displays the pyridine-IR
spectra, adsorbed on the HZSM-5, alk-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-HZSM-5, 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5,
[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5, and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5
catalysts. Three characteristic peaks at 1450, 1545, and 1492 cm–1 represented the amount of the Lewis acid sites (LASs),
BASs alongside both BAS and LAS in the samples, respectively. Figure S3 also illustrates the subsequent increase
in the amount of the LASs together with decreasing in the BASs after
metal impregnation on the parent HZSM-5. Additionally, the alkali
treatment on the parent zeolite gave rise to decrease in the amount
of LASs and BASs. The estimated peak area for each of the said acid
sites on the catalysts in Figure S3 generally
registered corresponding significant increases in the proportion of
the BAS (recorded at 1545 cm–1) and the LAS (recorded
at 1450 cm–1) for the samples, suggesting the following
order:(a) Suggested order for BAS order recorded
at 1545 cm–1

  (b) Suggested order for LAS recorded at
1450 cm–1

  

These observations
were also in agreement with NH3-TPD
results.

2.2 Catalytic Performance of the Zeolite Catalysts
in MTA
Table S1 shows a L16 Taguchi orthogonal array nominated for the test plan because
the optimization process to obtain the best results for catalytic
performance of the MTA process over low-Si/Al-ratio practically required
32 experiments to obtain the best resulted for the catalyst in terms
of Si/Al, metal, alkali treatment, WHSV, and temperature parameters.
Fundamentally, optimization of the parameters by Taguchi method is
a simple way to attain the best operational condition, needless to
do unnecessary experiments, as long as the parameters are unaffected
by alternation in environmental conditions as well as the other noise
factors. To achieve this goal, a superior design of orthogonal arrays
is required by employing the Taguchi method, wherein a loss function
should be considered for the deviation of the experimental from the
desired values.54 Meanwhile, the loss function
values were also converted into a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Normally,
there are three categories of performance, treated as the index of
S/N ratio in the analysis. The S/N ratio for each level of the catalyst
preparation parameters was calculated on the basis of the S/N analysis.
Hence, the finest level of a typical parameter would be the highest
S/N ratio. According to the Taguchi method, four catalysts were prepared
and tested in our experiments. Meanwhile, in the next step, three
other samples were synthesized, given that the results of the previous
phase. The selected catalyst with the highest activity was considered
to be studied in MTA processes in detail. Then, the collected data
from Table S1 were analyzed using Minitab-18
software to calculate the effect of each projected factor on the optimization
conditions. The results were summarized in Table S2 and Figure S4. Figure S4 shows that HZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio < 20, Zn impregnated,
alkali treated as well as MTA experiments at the lowest temperature
and WHSV advocated the best performance for the catalyst.

In
order to discuss catalytic performance of the prepared samples in
MTA process, the liquid hydrocarbons of the products were evaluated
by gas chromatography (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry (GC–MS)
methods (Table 3).

Table 3 certifies
the highest level of the aromatics (>85%) for the impregnated HZSM-5
samples, explicitly 0.8Zn-HZSM-5, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5, [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5,
and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5. Moreover, Table 3 reserves the highest aromatic selectivity
together with the lowest benzene content over the bimetallic catalysts
for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5. As shown in Table 3, the weight percent of benzene and xylenes
for alk-HZSM-5 was 0.0 and 39.4 wt %, respectively. Moreover, this
table demonstrates the weight percent of benzene and xylenes for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
catalyst as 0.1 and 44.7 wt %, respectively. The observed low level
of benzene for alk-HZSM-5 and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 may largely
be due to the synergistic effect between its higher mesoporous volume
and stronger acid sites as the alkaline low Si/Al-HZSM-5 zeolites.

As seen in Figure 7, among the aforesaid samples, the highest aromatic selectivity together
with the lowest benzene content over the bimetallic catalysts was
found for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, higher than the parent HZSM-5.

Figure 7 compares
the liquid hydrocarbon cut selectivity for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
with respect to the parent HZSM-5 in detail.

Along with difference
in their catalyst activity, the comparative
changes of the product distribution in these two catalysts were also
notable. The diagrams in Figure 7 represent higher percentage of xylenes in the product,
applying [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst than the parent HZSM-5.
However, the most outstanding feature of the aromatic selectivity
for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 zeolite was the lowest percentage of
benzene (<1%) found for in the product mixture.

The constituents
of liquid hydrocarbons produced in the presence
of HZSM-5 and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 are also separately illustrated
in Tables 4 and 5.

Tables 4 and 5 show that the dominant hydrocarbons
found in the
products are 63.8 and 77.7% alkyl aromatics, that is toluene, ortho, meta, and para xylenes
(o, m, and p-XYL),
methyl ethyl benzene (M-E-BZ), and tri-methylbenzene (3M-BZ) for the
parent HZSM-5 and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, respectively. The products
exhibited a growth in weight percent of alkyl aromatics up to 13.9%
after improvement. Compared with the parent HZSM-5 catalyst, Tables 4 and 5 indicate that the selectivity versus aromatic product increases
in [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5. Referring to the previous reports revealed
that Fattahi et al.18 represented average
mass fraction of alkyl aromatic components for HZSM-5 was up to 70.70
wt %, wherein the existence of zinc element on the improved catalyst
upgraded this value up to 77.30 wt %. In this report,18 a maximum increase in weight percent of alkyl aromatics
up to 6.6% was observed over the Zn-impregnated (0.75 wt %) catalyst,
with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 54 at WHSV
equal to 4 h–1, while in our experiments a 13.9%
increase in weight percent of alkyl aromatics was observed for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5.
As revealed in Table 5, the analysis of the hydrocarbon cut in the MTA process on the HZSM-5
catalyst indicates on the reduction of the weight percent of toluene
from 27.4 to 13.5 wt %, after 8 h, meanwhile executing the process
on the [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a weight percent
decrease from 18.3 to 12.9 wt % for the production of toluene after
6 h. The weight percent of 3M-BZ also reduced from 8.9 to 6.9 wt %,
after 8 h for HZSM-5, while the corresponding change in the presence
of [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst was observed as 11.5 to 9.9 wt
%, after 6 h.

The product distributions in the gas phase over
[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
catalyst are demonstrated in Table 6.

Table 6 summarizes
the gas-phase product distribution, namely methane, ethane, ethene,
and propane. The data in Table 6 signify that the mole percent of ethylene increases with
time on stream (TOS), for 6 h, attributed to the enhancement of the
so-called shape-selective effects of the catalyst by occurring coke
deposition in the cavities of the catalyst, leading to suppression
of the formation of the larger molecules. Meanwhile, the gaseous product
distributions over the [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst are showed
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Product distributions
in gas phase for the MTA process, catalyzed
by [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 at TR = 375
°C.

Figure 8 indicates
the higher methane formation after 8 h, due to the formation of more
carbon deposition, leading to more demethylation reactions.

The average production of the aromatic components (BTX) over HZSM-5
and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 samples is demonstrated in Figure 9.

BTX components over the parent HZSM-5 and

Evidently, the [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst
exhibits great
improvements in selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons, in especial
for xylenes (Figure 9). The selectivity of the aromatic components over HZSM-5 and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
is also addressed in Table 7.

Table 7 represents
that alk-HZSM-5 catalyst produced 75.3 wt % aromatics along with xylenes
and benzene selectivity as 39.4 and 0.0%, respectively. Although the
alkali treatment of HZSM-5 to give alk-HZSM catalyst could considerably
promote the aromatic products in the MTA process, but co-impregnation
of alk-HZSM-5 to [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 was capable to upgrade the
hydrocarbon cut to: 86.8 wt % aromatics, consisting of xylenes selectivity
44.7%, higher than the best results reported before.33 More selectivity for xylenes (44.7%) alongside very low
benzene content (0.1%) in the products of [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
zeolite recommended it as an eligible candidate for MTA process.

Figure 10 demonstrates
that higher benzene (4.8–5.1%), toluene (>30%), as well
as
lower xylenes (<32%) selectivity were observed for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5
and [0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5, wherein the metal content of the catalyst
increased.

Figure 10 Selectivity of the aromatic products on various catalysts
for the
MTA reaction. (Reaction condition: T = 375 °C,
WHSV = 2 h–1).

Figure 10 denotes
the selectivity for aromatic hydrocarbons 66.9 wt %, benzene selectivity
5.1 wt %, and toluene selectivity 30.1% of the [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5
catalyst. By increasing the metal content of this catalyst to afford
[0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5 catalyst, the aforesaid selectivity did not experience
any significant changes. Figure 10 also establishes that the alkali-treated sample, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5,
exhibits the following selectivity as: 64.9 wt % for aromatic hydrocarbons,
0.1 wt % for benzene and 15.9% for toluene. In these cases, the decrease
in toluene and benzene contents in the product has evidently been
compensated with increasing in the xylene content, explicitly m- and p-xylenes. These assumptions were
also in agreement with our previous conclusion about the PSDs shown
in Figure 5 for these
samples. As evident from Figure 5, all of those samples having pores with 40 nm were
capable to produce more xylenes at the expense of reducing in benzene
and toluene contents. The mechanism of this proposal could be attributed
to eligibility of 40 nm pore size for more alkylation of benzene and
toluene to xylenes. Although, Jiang et al.43 showed that the impregnation of Fe on the ZSM-5 catalyst resulted
in more BASs, but the efficiency of Fe-impregnation to promote the
Friedel–Crafts alkylation as well as the effect of acid sites
on the samples should not be ignored.

Furthermore, Figure 10 shows that alkaline
treatment on the parent HZSM-5 resulted
in the production of benzene-free product, having low toluene (13.8%)
and high xylenes (39.4%) selectivity. Among the xylenes, m- and p-xylenes experienced more increase, owing
to rising in metal ion contents on the parent HZSM-5. Olson and Haag55 reported the relationship between the diffusion
time of o-xylene over various HZSM-5 catalysts on p-xylene selectivity. It is well known that MTA is an acid
catalytic reaction, enjoying from the synergetic effect between BAS
and LAS.56 Consistent with this proposal,
the stronger BASs, the more active sites for the reaction. An increase
in the amount of acid sites, however, improves the olefin cyclization
reaction together with deep alkylation reaction of the aromatic products,
leading to a subsequent increase in the formation of polyalkylaromatics
in the reaction.

Figure 11 compares
the conversion of methanol as a function of TOS at HZSM-5 and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
zeolites.

Figure 11 Conversion of methanol as a function of TOS at HZSM-5 and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
zeolites. (Reaction condition: T = 375 °C, WHSV
= 2 h–1).

Practically, [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst
in Figure 11 were
found to best active sample in MTA process so that their initial catalytic
activities remained fully constant up to 4 h, for example keeping
>97% of its activity after 8 h (Figure 11). A typical 75.8% catalytic activity was
also obtained for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst after 12 h, checked
as the best catalyst for MTA processes within our zeolite series.
The observed stability was also consistent with several recent reports.38,50 For instance, as the latest similar work,40 Lai et al. studied the methanol aromatization over Ga-doped desilicated
HZSM-5 with an SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of
23. They showed that methanol conversion over the parent HZSM-5 was
80% only for 11.5 h TOS. In another study,58 Zhang et al. reported the cadmium-modified HZSM-5 for the selective
conversion of methanol for 4 h.

Moreover, the coke formation
in the fresh and used [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
catalyst was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 12).

Figure 12 TGA curve of [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
zeolite.

The weight loss at 25–150
°C was attributed to the
elimination of the physically adsorbed water in the catalysts. The
coked [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst exhibited a typical weight
loss of 10% after 8 h on stream. Besides, the coke content of the
spent catalyst resulted in a weight loss at ca. 150–800 °C.
Meanwhile, the fresh [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 sample represented 8.6%
weight loss after 8 h on stream. These observations suggested that
the coke formation process was a little more than the reported value
for Fe-ZSM-5, which was attributed to more extensive porosity of [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5.
Moreover, the weight loss in the temperature range of 500–600
°C could be attributed to removing of the organic template, tetra
propyl ammonium ion (TPA+) in fresh noncalcinated-[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
zeolite. According to the abovementioned results, it is deduced that
[0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst displays remarkable catalytic performance
in the MTA process in comparison to the parent HZSM-5 zeolite based
on more production of aromatics, explicitly m- and p-xylenes.

3 Conclusions
The
following conclusions could be drawn from this research:(1)By employing the Taguchi method
alongside analysis
of data, the number of the required experiments to accomplish a systematic
study on the effect of such parameters as Si/Al, the type of metal
impregnation, alkali treatment, WHSV, and temperature was reduced
from 32 to 16 parameters.

(2)The postmodification
of alkali-modified low-Si/Al
HZSM-5 by Fe(NO3)3 and Zn(NO3)2 resulted in a new bimetallic [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalyst,
enjoying from: (a) larger surface area and (b) lower pore diameter
and particle size with respective to the parent HZSM-5.

(3) The catalyst lifetime for both HZSM-5
and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5 catalysts was significantly high enough
to keep >97% of its activity after 8 h and 75.8% after 12 h in
MTA
process.

(4) The incorporation
of Fe decreases
the acidity of the catalyst resulted in subsequent low coke formation.

(5) The combination of long
lifetime for
the catalyst and high aromatics selectivity for [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5
makes this work a leading study on application of metal impregnation
process on a low-Si/Al HZSM-5 zeolite as a significant candidate for
conversion of methanol to benzene-free aromatics, specifically m- and p-xylenes

(6) Mechanistically, the large pores,
that is 40 nm, found in metal-impregnated alkali-treated HZSM-5 were
proposed as the leading structural factor for the observed promotional
catalytic effect.

technique reported by Karimi et al.57 with
few modifications. The gel molar composition was 1Al2O3/22SiO2/2.7TPAOH/5Na2O/2500H2O. Finally, the calcined NaZSM-5 (at 550 °C for 8 h) was undergone
ion exchange treatment by stirring with a 0.8 M NH4NO3 solution (by the 1:8 mass ratio) at 80 °C for 12 h prior
to washing with distilled water. The NH4ZSM-5 zeolite was
obtained after repeating the same procedure for three times on NaZSM-5.
The proton-form of the zeolite powder was also prepared after drying
of the NH4ZSM-5 sample at 110 °C overnight prior to
calcination at 550 °C for 5 h.

4.1.3 Alkaline
Treated HZSM-5
The NaZSM-5
zeolite was desilicated by employing the method reported before,21 the NaZSM-5 catalyst was stirred with 0.3 M
NaOH solution (the ratio of 8 mL NaOH solution/1 g zeolite) at 80
°C for 2 h. Later, the suspension was cooled down prior to filtering
and neutralizing the remaining of NaOH on the zeolite by diluted HNO3. The zeolite sample was dehydrated at 110 °C for 5 h
before stirring in a 0.8 M NH4NO3 solution at
80 °C for 12 h in 1:8 mass ratio. The slurry was filtered and
decanted with distilled water as well as executing the aforesaid procedure
on the sample for three times. After drying the sample at 110 °C
overnight, the calcination was accomplished at 550 °C for 5 h
to form alk-HZSM-5 zeolite.

4.1.4 Catalysts
Promotion
The catalyst
was promoted by Zn via wet impregnation of alk-HZSM-5 and HZSM-5 zeolites
with aqueous solutions of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O to achieve 0.8 wt % Zn loading, respectively. The reaction
mixtures were stirred for 24 h, and the impregnated samples dried
at 110 °C overnight and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.21 The resultant samples were denoted as 0.8Zn-alk-HZSM-5
and 0.8Zn-HZSM-5, respectively.

The initial wetness method with
an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O
on HZSM-5 and alk-HZSM-5 zeolites was employed to achieve 0.2 wt %
Fe and 0.3 wt % Zn loading as the other bimetallic-promoted catalysts,
while the mixtures were stirred for 24 h. Subsequently, the samples
dried at 110 °C for 16 h prior to aerobic calcination at 550
°C for 6 h. The catalysts were designated as [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-HZSM-5
and [0.2Fe,0.3Zn]-alk-HZSM-5, respectively. The same method was applied
to make the final promoted catalyst ([0.4Fe,0.6Zn]-HZSM-5) by employing
co-impregnation of HZSM-5 to achieved typical loading as 0.4 wt %
Fe and 0.6 wt % Zn. In all of the abovementioned cases, the metals
loading on HZSM-5 zeolite were determined by EDXS analysis.

4.2 Catalytic Characterization
The catalyst
samples were characterized by employing XRD, X-ray fluorescence (XRF),
N2 adsorption/desorption, NH3-TPD, TGA, FT-IR,
FE-SEM, and FE-SEM/EDXS techniques. The applied instruments were as
follows:

4.2.1 X-Ray Diffraction
To determine
the extent of crystallinity for different samples, the XRD patterns
were carried out within 2θ = 5–80° by a D8 ADVANCE
Bruker X-ray diffractometer having Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å).

4.2.2 N2 Adsorption/Desorption
Isotherms
The porosity of the zeolites was monitored by means
of the nitrogen
physisorption at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010
instrument. Total specific surface areas (SBET) of the catalysts were calculated by employing nitrogen adsorption
isotherms using the BET method in the P/P0 range 0.05–0.25. Furthermore, in order to measure
the surface area of the catalysts, prior to adsorption of N2, 250 mg of the samples was degassed at 300 °C for 3 h. The
total pore volume (VTotal) was evaluated
by the amount of adsorbed nitrogen at a relative pressure of ∼0.99.
The size distribution of the mesopores was calculated by the adsorption
isotherm using the BJH method. In order to calculate the micropore
surface area (SMicro) and the micropore
volume (VMicro) in P/P0 = 0.1–0.4, the t-plot
method was applied. The mesopore volume (VMeso) could be calculated based on the difference between the calculated
total volume and the relevant micropore volume.

4.2.3 Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy
A Tescan
MIRA3-LMU scanning electron microscope was employed to
determine the particle size and morphology of the zeolites, working
at a potential difference of 15 kV. Moreover, an EDXS system is coupled
with the FE-SEM chamber. In order to prepare the samples, the zeolite
crystals were deposited on a silicon wafer using dispersion, whereby
the samples were subsequently covered with a gold film.

4.2.4 NH3-TPD
In order to
determine the total acidity along with the type (weak and strong)
of acidic sites on the catalyst samples, the NH3-TPD method
was employed by using a Micromeritics TPD/TPR 2900 chemisorption analyzer.
In these experiments, 0.1 g of samples was pretreated at 500 °C
for 2 h prior to measure the desorption of NH3 in the range
of 100–700 °C.

4.2.5 X-ray Fluorescence
The Si/Al molar
ratio of the HZSM-5 zeolite was accomplished on an Axios XRF spectrometer.

4.2.6 FT-IR Spectroscopy
FT-IR data were
collected at room temperature by using KBr pellets technique on an
RXI-PerkinElmer spectrometer with the resolution of 4 cm–1 to address surface functional groups, in the range of 500–4000
cm–1.

4.2.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The
TGA system was hired to monitor the thermal decomposition behavior
for the template within the fresh catalyst alongside the coke content
in corresponding spent catalyst. The samples were run on a PerkinElmer
Diamond TGA instrument at 30–800 °C by a heating rate
of 10 °C min–1. After heating, 6.5 mg of catalyst
up to 150 °C, the system was also purged by a nitrogen flow (6
L min–1) prior to heating (2 °C min–1) under the air flow (6 L min–1) from 30 to 800
°C.

4.2.8 TEM Images
TEM
images were recorded
on Zeiss EM900 equipment, operated at 100 kV. The samples were prepared
by sonicating the powder in ethanol for 15 min and dropping the suspension
onto the carbon-coated Cu grids.

4.2.9 FT-IR
of Pyridine Adsorption Spectroscopy
(Py-IR)
Py-IR spectra of samples were recorded on an RXI-PerkinElmer
FT-IR spectrometer. The samples were activated under a vacuum of 5
× 10–3 Pa using by Alcatel Adixen 2005SD Pascal
vacuum pump at 175 °C for 3 h. Then, pyridine was adsorbed onto
the samples at 30 °C for 1 h, and the samples were heated up
to 150 °C prior to running their Py-IR spectra.

4.3 Catalytic Performance
A fixed-bed
tubular reactor was applied to determine the efficiency of the catalyst
samples in the MTA process at 375 °C under ambient pressure.
A graduated burette attached to a micro tube pump (prep pump, Chem
Tech Co. Ltd.) working at a flow rate of 0.1 mL/min was applied for
pumping of liquid methanol at WHSV of 2 h–1. Methanol
stream was preheated at 120 °C prior to delivering to the setup.
Meanwhile, this stream was mixed with nitrogen and delivered to the
reactor. Figure 13 represents the experimental setup.

Figure 13 Representation of the lab scale setup.

The tubular reactor is composed
of a stainless steel tube (length
380 mm; i.d. 9 mm), heating at three zones by employing an electric
furnace at 375 °C. In order to measure the axial temperature
profile, it was equipped with two thermocouples attached to the top
and the bottom of the reactor. Besides, a perforated circular plate
was welded to the upper thermo-well to serve as the catalyst holding
support. The catalyst was located in the middle part of the reactor,
wherein the isothermal conditions were established. A temperature
of the condenser was maintained at −1 °C served to remove
the condensable gases from the products passing through the reactor,
while the noncondensable were led through a product separator, a bubble
flow meter prior to venting. The gas phase was sent to the gas flow
meter and a gas chromatograph Agilent 7890A, analyzing the gaseous
phase with nitrogen as carrier gas. A GC-Varian 3800 instrument was
applied to analyze offline the liquid products that were collected
after every hour at the end of the experiments. Furthermore, the liquid
hydrocarbons collected over a period of 8 h were analyzed by GC–MS
instrument. For this purpose, a Hewlett-Packard (HP, Palo Alto, USA)
HP 6890 series GC fitted with a split/splitless injector and a HP
5973 mass-selective detector system were applied, whereby the catalytic
performance of the reaction was measured. Henceforth, the methanol
conversion (xMeOH) in the MTA reaction
was calculated by eq 1. 1  where N signifies the number
of moles, superscript “i” denotes the inlet of the reactor
and superscript “o” refers to the outlet.
