Two tetranuclear mixed-valence cobalt(III/II) complexes
having
the general formula [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(Ln)(μ-O2CC6H4NO2)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (where H2L1 and
H2L2 are two reduced Schiff base ligands) have
been synthesized and characterized. The structures of both complexes
show cobalt(II) and cobalt(III) centers with a distorted octahedral
geometry with cobalt(III) and cobalt(II) centers located at the inner
N2O2 and outer O4 cavities of the
reduced Schiff base ligands, respectively. The oxidation states of
both cobalt centers have been confirmed by bond valence sum (BVS)
calculations. The magnetic properties show that both compounds behave
as cobalt(II) dimers connected through an end-to-end azido bridging
ligand and show moderate antiferromagnetic Co(II)–Co(II) couplings
of −11.0 and −14.4 cm–1 for 1 and 2, respectively, as also corroborated by
DFT calculations, Jtheo = −13.07
cm–1 for 1 and −12.49 cm–1 for 2. The calculated spin densities
of both complexes at the cobalt(II) centers are −2.75 and +2.75,
respectively, clearly supporting that they are the magnetic centers.

Introduction
High-nuclearity complexes containing paramagnetic
metal centers
have attracted huge interest due to their interesting physical properties,
architectural beauty, and magnetostructural correlations in the field
of coordination chemistry.1,2 During the process of
their synthesis, partial oxidation of manganese(II), iron(II), and
cobalt(II) usually produces mixed-valence polynuclear complexes.3−8 Focusing on mixed-valence cobalt complexes, they are less abundant
compared to those of manganese and iron but much more interesting
because of their wide range of applications in magnetism and electrochromism.9,10 The archetypal normal spinel Co3O4 is probably
the best-known mixed-valence complex of cobalt. It presents low-spin
cobalt(III) centers occupying octahedral holes and high-spin cobalt(II)
centers occupying tetrahedral ones.11

Schiff bases have been widely used by various groups to prepare
many mixed-valence cobalt(III)/cobalt(II) complexes,12−29 including a few trinuclear examples.12−20 Macrocyclic Schiff bases prepared by condensation of different diamines
with 4-alkyl-2,6-diformylphenols have also been used to prepare dinuclear
cobalt mixed-valence complexes21−25 although their magnetic properties have not been reported. On the
other hand, many hydroxide-rich Schiff bases have also been used to
form dinuclear mixed-valence complexes, including a few examples showing
single-molecule magnet (SMM) behavior.26−29

In the present work, we
have used reduced Schiff bases to prepare
phenoxido-bridged dinuclear cobalt(III)–(O)2–cobalt(II)
moieties, which are further connected by end-to-end azide bridges
to form tetranuclear mixed-valence Co(II/III) complexes with CoIII–(O)2–CoII–(N3)–CoIII–(O)2–CoII cores. Since Co(III) ions are low-spin diamagnetic centers,
from a magnetic point of view, the tetrameric moieties can be considered
as Co(II) dimers connected via end-to-end azide bridges in both compounds.

Here, we report a new strategy, using two different compartmental
reduced Schiff base ligands and azide as a coligand, for the synthesis
of two tetranuclear mixed-valence cobalt(III/II) complexes: [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L1)(μ-O2CC6H4NO2)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (1) where
H2L1 = (1,3-propanediyl)-bis(iminomethylene)bis(6-methoxyphenol),
and [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L2)(μ-O2CC6H4NO2)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (2), where H2L2 = (1,3-propanediyl)bis(iminomethylene)bis(6-ethoxyphenol)
(2). Both complexes have been structurally characterized
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies and also by spectral and
elemental analyses. The magnetic properties indicate the presence
of two high-spin (S = 3/2) cobalt(II) centers in both complexes with
moderate antiferromagnetic couplings. To obtain a better understanding
of the magnetic exchange mechanism, quantum mechanical (DFT) calculations
have been performed.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All chemicals used were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and were of reagent grade. They were used as received,
without further purification.

Although no problems were encountered
in this work, care should be taken while handling as perchlorate salts
and organic ligands in the presence of azide are potentially explosive.
Only a small amount of the material should be prepared, and it should
be handled with care.

Synthesis of Reduced Schiff Base Ligands
Synthesis of H2L1 [(1,3-Propanediyl)bis(iminomethylene)bis(6-methoxyphenol)]
A solution of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde (608 mg, 4 mmol) and 1,3-propanediamine
(0.22 mL, 2 mmol) in 20 mL of methanol was refluxed for 2 h to prepare
the Schiff base ligand N,N′-bis(3-methoxysalicylidene)-1,3-propanediamine, H2La. The resulting solution was cooled to 0 °C, and solid
sodium borohydride (150 mg, 4 mmol) was gently added to this methanolic
solution with continuous stirring. The solution was further acidified
with glacial acetic acid (10 mL) and placed under reduced pressure
in a rotary evaporator (60 °C). The residue was then dissolved
in water (15 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (15 mL). The dichloromethane
fraction was dried using anhydrous sodium acetate, and the solution
was filtered to remove the solid sodium acetate to obtain a solution
of the desired reduced Schiff base ligand, H2L1. It was then
extracted in methanol and was directly used for the synthesis of the
cobalt complex 1 (see below).

Synthesis of H2L2 [(1,3-Propanediyl)bis(iminomethylene)bis(6-ethoxyphenol)]
This ligand was prepared as H2L1 but using 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde
(664 mg, 4 mmol) instead of 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde. The obtained
ligand N,N′-bis(3-ethoxysalicylidene)-1,3-propanediamine, H2Lb, was also reduced with sodium borohydride, and the final resulting
solution was directly used for the synthesis of the cobalt complex 2 (see below).

Synthesis of Compounds 1 and 2
Synthesis of [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L1)(μ-O2CC6H4NO2)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (1)
A solution of cobalt(II) perchlorate hexahydrate
(732 mg, 2 mmol) in methanol (10 mL) was added to the methanol solution
of the reduced Schiff base ligand, H2L1, with constant stirring
to obtain a dark brown solution. A solution of 3-nitrobenzoic acid
(334 mg, 2 mmol) in methanol (20 mL) was then added to the dark brown
solution followed by the addition, with constant stirring, of a solution
of sodium azide (130 mg, 2 mmol) in 10 mL of methanol/water (in a
4:1 ratio). The resulting solution was stirred for 1 h, and a solution
of NH4PF6 (163 mg, 1 mmol) in methanol (5 mL)
was then added followed by 30 min of stirring. Single crystals, suitable
for X-ray diffraction, were obtained after 5–6 days on slow
evaporation of the solution in an open atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction
confirmed the phase purity of the sample (see the Supporting Information).

Compound 2 was synthesized
following a similar synthetic procedure used for the synthesis of
complex 1 except that H2L2 was used as a reduced
Schiff base ligand instead of H2L1. Single crystals, suitable
for X-ray diffraction, were obtained after 3–4 days on slow
evaporation of the solution in an open atmosphere. X-ray powder diffraction
confirmed the phase purity of the sample (see the Supporting Information).

Physical Measurements
Elemental analyses (C, H, and
N) were performed using a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer. IR
spectra in KBr pellets (4500–500 cm–1) were
recorded with a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two spectrophotometer. Electronic
spectra in acetonitrile (900–200 nm) were recorded on a PerkinElmer
Lambda 35 UV–visible spectrophotometer. Magnetic measurements
were performed with a Quantum Design MPMS-XL-7 SQUID magnetometer
with an applied magnetic field of 0.1 T in the 2–300 K temperature
range on polycrystalline samples with masses of 8.092 and 25.454 mg
for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. The
isothermal magnetization measurements were done with fields up to
7 T at 2 K. The susceptibility data were corrected for the sample
holder and for the diamagnetic contribution of the salts using Pascal’s
constants.30 The X-ray powder diffractograms
were collected for polycrystalline samples of both compounds using
a 0.7 mm glass capillary that was mounted and aligned on an Empyrean
PANalytical powder diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation (λ
= 1.54177 Å). A total of three scans were collected at room temperature
in the 2θ range 5–40°.

X-ray Crystallography
Suitable single crystals of both
complexes were used for data collection using a “Bruker D8
QUEST area detector” diffractometer equipped with graphite-monochromated
Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structures were
solved by the direct method and refined by full-matrix least squares
on F2 using the SHELXL-18 package.31 Non-hydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic
thermal parameters. Hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen atoms were
located by difference Fourier maps and were kept at fixed positions.
All other hydrogen atoms were placed in their geometrically idealized
positions and constrained to ride on their parent atoms. Multiscan
empirical absorption corrections were applied to the data using the
program SADABS.32 A summary of the crystallographic
data is listed in Table 1. Selected bond lengths and angles are listed in Table S1 in the Supporting Information.

Computational Details
A DFT study is carried out to
understand the electronic structure of the investigated complex. All
geometry optimizations of the complex are carried out using the density
functional theory method at the B3LYP level with the Gaussian 09 program
package. Los Alamos effective core potentials lanL2DZ basis set was
employed for the Co atom. On the other hand, the split-valence 6-31G(d)
basis set was applied for the other atoms. The starting structure
of the investigated complex was used from its X-ray crystallographic
data. The geometry optimization is performed without any constraint,
and the nature of stationary points was confirmed by normal-mode analysis.
The traditional broken-symmetry (BS) scheme for the same functional,
as implemented in ORCA,33 was applied to
calculate magnetic exchange coupling constants (J). The energy difference between the high-spin and broken-symmetry
solutions along with their spin expectation values ⟨S2⟩ was used in the Yamaguchi34,35 formula as shown in the following equation  

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The two hexadentate N2O2O′2 donor compartmental Schiff base ligands, H2La and H2Lb, were synthesized
by refluxing in methanol 1,3-propanediamine with 3-methoxysalicylaldehyde
or 3-ethoxysalicylaldehyde, respectively. The resulting Schiff base
solutions were reduced with sodium borohydride in methanol to obtain
the corresponding reduced Schiff base ligands, H2L1 and H2L2, respectively. The reaction of Co(ClO4)·6H2O with the reduced Schiff bases gave two mixed-valence Co(II/III)
complexes, [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L1)(μ-(NO2)PhCOO)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (1) and [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L2)(μ-(NO2)PhCOO)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (2), which are stabilized by the presence of
bridging 3-nitrobenzoate and azide ligands. The synthetic procedure
of both complexes is shown in Scheme 1.

Description of the Structures of [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L1)(μ-O2CC6H4NO2)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (1) and [(μ1,3-N3){CoII(L2)(μ-O2CC6H4NO2)CoIII(N3)}2]PF6 (2)
X-ray crystal structure determination reveals that both complexes
crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c and that they contain two Co(II) and two Co(III) ions,
in agreement with the charge balance, the Co–N and Co–O
bond distances, and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations (vide infra).36−41

The asymmetric unit of each complex consists of one Co(III)
and one Co(II) center, one complete reduced deprotonated Schiff base
ligand: (L1)2– in 1 and
(L2)2– in 2, one 3-nitrobenzoate
anion, one terminal N3– anion, half bridging
N3– anion, and half PF6– anion. The presence of a C2 axis passing
through the central N atom (N6) of the bridging N3– anion generates Co2IICo2III tetramers, as depicted in Figures 1–3. The total cationic charge of the Co2IICo2III tetramer (+10) is
compensated by two (NO2)PhCOO– ligands,
two terminal N3– ligands, two deprotonated
reduced Schiff base ligands: (L1)2– in 1 and (L2)2– in 2, the bridging N3– ligand, and the isolated
PF6– anion.

Figure 3 View of the tetranuclear Co2IICo2III complex in compound 1 (similar

the metal
centers have been shown for clarity.

In both complexes, the Co(III) centers (Co1) occupy
the inner N2O2 cavities of the ligands and show
a fac-CoO3N3 coordination environment.
The Co(II)
centers (Co2) occupy the outer O2O′2 cavities
and present a CoO5N coordination environment. Both cobalt
atoms (Co1 and Co2) are hexacoordinated and adopt a distorted octahedral
geometry with a much higher distortion for Co2, as shown by the SHAPE
analysis of both cobalt ions (see the Supporting Information).42 In fact, this SHAPE
analysis shows that the coordination geometry of both Co2 ions is
intermediate between distorted octahedral and trigonal prism.43

The central Co2IICo2III clusters in compounds 1 and 2 are very
similar. Thus, in both compounds, the equatorial plane of Co1 is formed
by two amine nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) and two phenoxido oxygen atoms
(O1 and O2) from the deprotonated reduced Schiff base ligand. The
axial positions of Co1 are occupied by a N atom (N3) from a terminal
azide ligand and by an oxygen atom (O5) from the carboxylate group
of the 3-nitrobenzoate ligand (Figure 3). The equatorial plane of Co2 in both compounds is
formed by four oxygen atoms (O1, O2, O3, and O4) from the reduced
Schiff base ligand, and the axial positions are occupied by the other
oxygen atom (O6) of the carboxylate group of the 3-nitrobenzoate ligand
and by a N atom (N4) from a bridging N3– ligand. Therefore, Co1 and Co2 are connected through a double oxido
bridge (O1 and O2 from the reduced Schiff base ligand) and by a syn–syn
carboxylate bridge (O5 and O6 form the 3-nitrobenzoate ligand). This
triple bridge gives rise to very short Co1···Co2 distances
of 2.994(3) Å in 1 and 2.999(2) Å in 2. The two Co2 atoms are only connected through a single μ1,3-N3– bridge (Figure 3) with a Co2···Co2
separation of 5.59(3) Å in 1 and 5.61(1) Å
in 2.

The saturated 6-membered chelate rings, Co1–N1–C9–C10–C11–N2
in complex 1 and Co1–N1–C10–C11–C12–N2
in complex 2, present chair conformations with puckering
parameters of θ(2) = 0.569(4) Å and φ = 181(2)°
in 1 and θ(2) = 0.573(7) Å and φ = 357(5)°
in 2.44

Both amine nitrogen
centers {N(1) and N(2)} in each complex reside
in an identical chiral environment, and the configurations of both
centers are R and S for N1 and N2, respectively,
as shown in Figure 4.

BVS Calculations
Based on crystallographically determined
metal–ligand bond
distances, the oxidation state of the metal ions in the crystalline
solids can be evaluated using BVS calculations. Mathematically, the
bond valences (sij) can
be evaluated using eq 1.36−41 1  where i is the donor center, j is the metal center; r0 is
the reported bond length between i and j, rij is the observed
bond length, sij is the
valence of a bond between two atoms i and j, and b is usually considered to be 0.37.
The bond valence sum is calculated according to eq 2 2  where zj is the valence of atom j connecting i–j bonds with all neighboring i atoms.

The calculated bond valence sum (BVS) values
for Co1 (2.96 in 1 and 2.94 in 2) and Co2
(2.02 in 1 and 2.01 in 2) clearly confirm
that the oxidation state
of Co1 is +3, whereas that of Co2 is +2.

Supramolecular Interactions
Table 2 lists the
hydrogen bonding interactions in complexes 1 and 2. In both complexes, two hydrogen atoms of the reduced Schiff
base ligand (H1 and H2) are available for hydrogen bonding. Thus,
H1 (from the amine nitrogen atom N1) is involved in intramolecular
H-bonding with a fluorine atom (F1 in 1 and F3(b) in 2; (b) = −x, 1 – y, 1 – z) of the non-coordinated
PF6– anion. The other H atom (H2, from
the amine nitrogen atom N2) is H-bonded to the nitrobenzoate oxygen
atom (O8(a) in 1 and O7(c) in 2; (a) = 3/2 – x, 3/2 – y, 1 – z and (c) = 1/2 – x, 3/2 – y, 1 – z). All of these interactions led to the formation of chainlike structures
as shown in Figures 5 and 6 for compounds 1 and 2, respectively. None of the compounds show significant C–H···π
and π···π interactions.

IR and Electronic Spectra
The IR and electronic spectra
of both tetranuclear cobalt complexes
are in agreement with their crystal structures (see the Supporting Information). Sharp bands observed
in the 3240–3190 cm–1 range in the IR spectra
of both complexes, attributed to the N–H stretching vibration,
confirm the presence of the reduced Schiff base.14 The bands corresponding to the alkyl C–H stretching
can be observed in the range of 2985–2950 cm–1 for both complexes. The symmetric and antisymmetric carboxylate
stretching vibrations can be observed as sharp absorption bands respectively
at 1477 and 1532 cm–1 in 1 and 1470
and 1534 cm–1 in 2.45−46 A very strong double band observed at 2023 and 2121 cm–1 in 1 and 2028 and 2117 cm–1 in 2 confirms the presence of two types of azide groups (terminal
and bridging) in both complexes.

The UV–vis spectra of
compounds 1 and 2 are very similar (see
the Supporting Information). They show three absorption bands at ca. 618 nm
(ε ≈ 102 M–1 cm–1), ca. 330 nm (ε ≈ 103 M–1 cm–1), and ca. 235 nm (ε ≈ 104 M–1 cm–1). The higher-energy
absorption band at around 235 nm is assigned to intraligand π–π*
transitions,47 whereas the band at ca.
330 nm may be attributed to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer transition.
Finally, the band at ca. 618 nm can be attributed to any of the two
spin-allowed d–d transitions (1A1g → 1T1g and 1A1g → 1T2g) that are expected in low-spin cobalt(III)
complexes.16 The other spin-allowed transition
may be hidden by the strong LMCT transition at ca. 330 nm or might
be located at higher energies, out of the scan range.48 The bands corresponding to the electronic transitions from
cobalt(II) are not observed since they are hidden by the d–d
transitions from the Co(III) centers.13

Magnetic Properties
As expected, the magnetic properties
of compounds 1 and 2 are very similar. Thus,
the product of the molar
magnetic susceptibility per Co2IICo2III tetramer times the temperature (χmT) shows a value of ca. 5.3 cm3 K mol–1 at room temperature for both compounds and a continuous
decrease when the temperature is lowered to reach a value of 0.30
and 0.15 cm3 K mol–1 at 2 K for compounds 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 7a). This room temperature value is slightly
below than the expected value for two isolated octahedral Co(II) ions
(2.7–3.4 cm3 K mol–1 per Co(II)
ion). The low temperature value is well below the expected value for
two isolated Co(II) ions (1.5–1.8 cm3 K mol–1 per Co(II) ion),49 indicating
the presence of a moderate antiferromagnetic Co–Co coupling.
The isothermal magnetization at 2 K (Figure 7b) shows a linear increase of magnetization
in both compounds at high fields without reaching saturation at 7
T, confirming the presence of a moderate antiferromagnetic coupling.
Furthermore, the lower values of magnetization for compound 2 suggest that the magnetic coupling is slightly stronger
in this compound. Since the two Co(III) ions are low-spin d6 diamagnetic ions, we can assume that the magnetic properties are
due to the two Co(II) ions in the cluster and that they are antiferromagnetically
coupled through the μ1,3-N3– bridge. Accordingly, we have performed a simultaneous fit of the
χmT product and of the isothermal
magnetization at 2 K of both compounds to a Co(II) dimer model using
the program PHI.50 The model used includes
the spin–orbit coupling constant (λ), the orbital reduction
factor (α = κA), and the crystal field
distortion of the octahedral geometry (Δ) to account for the
relatively high distortions of the coordination geometry of the Co2
centers.49 This model reproduces very satisfactorily
the thermal variation of the χmT product and the magnetization at 2 K of both complexes in the 2–300
K range with the following set of parameters: α = 1.49, λ
= −130 cm–1, J = −11.0
cm–1, and Δ = 221 cm–1 for 1 and α = 1.49, λ = −17.5 cm–1, J = −14.4 cm–1, and Δ
= −100 cm–1 for 2 (solid lines
in Figure 7, the Hamiltonian
is written as H = −JS1S2). To reproduce the divergence
in the χm vs T plot at very low
temperatures (see the Supporting Information), we have included a monomeric Co(II) impurity of 5.5% for 1 and 3.5% for 2. Finally, to reduce the number
of parameters in the fit, we have corrected a fixed temperature-independent
paramagnetism of 2 × 10–3 cm3 mol–1 to account for the two Co(III) ions, a value close
to those observed in other Co(III)-containing compounds.51,52

in compounds 1 and 2. (b) Isothermal
magnetization at 2 K for compounds 1 and 2. Solid lines are the best fit to the model (see the text).

The J constant coupling is antiferromagnetic
in
both complexes, in agreement with the observed behavior in most of
the reported Co(II) complexes with single μ1,3-N3 bridges.53−63 Note that, as expected, both coupling constants are very similar,
given the similar structural parameters of the azido bridges in both
compounds (all of the bond distances and angles are almost identical,
see the Supporting Information).

Theoretical Studies
Orbital Analysis
The isodensity plots of α-HOMOs
of complexes 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 8. The isodensity
plots of the vacant LUMO and six singly occupied molecular orbitals
(SOMOs) of both complexes are gathered in Figures S8 and S9 (Supporting Information). The calculated results
(Tables 3 and 4) show that, for all SOMOs, the bridging azide and
the d orbitals of cobalt(II) have practically no contributions and
therefore the SOMO components do not favor magnetic exchange between
the two cobalt(II) centers via the bridging azide. However, in the
α-HOMO, a significant contribution of the bridging azide (68%
for 1 and 63% of 2) and the dz2 orbital of two Co2 centers (ca. 11% for both 1 and 2) has been observed. This indicates that the magnetic exchange
coupling has high contribution from bridging azide and Co centers
to the α-HOMO. This is also obvious from the isodensity plot
of α-HOMO (Figure 8).

Magnetism and Spin Population Analyses
The magnetic
coupling mechanism in the tetranuclear mixed-valence cobalt(III/II)
complexes has been studied using DFT. The value of J has been calculated using X-ray characterized geometries, and excellent
agreement has been found for both complexes (J =
−13.07 cm–1 in 1 and −12.49
cm–1 in 2).

Graphical representation
of spin population of both complexes is shown in Figure 9. The spin density at the cobalt(II)
centers is ∼2.7 e– in both complexes (high
spin value), thus confirming their oxidation states as +2, with some
spin density being delocalized on the ligand (to the atoms directly
bonded to cobalt). The spin densities calculated using the broken-symmetry
approach of +2.75 e– on one cobalt(II) and −2.75
e– on the other cobalt(II) center confirm that they
are the magnetic centers.

Conclusions
The synthesis of mixed-valence cobalt compounds
is an interesting
research topic because of the potential application of these complexes
as magnetic materials. In the current work, two tetranuclear mixed-valence
cobalt(III/II) compounds containing CoIII–(O)2–CoII–(N3)–CoIII–(O)2–CoII cores have
been synthesized using two N2O2O′2 donor compartmental “reduced Schiff base” blocking
ligands. They have been characterized by elemental and spectral analyses.
The structures have been confirmed by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction
study. Smaller cobalt(III) was placed in the inner N2O2 compartment, and larger cobalt(II) was placed in the outer
O2O′2 compartment in both complexes.
In each compound, cobalt centers exhibit pseudo-octahedral geometry
as confirmed by SHAPE analysis. Oxidation states of cobalt centers
were ascertained from charge balance the Co–N and Co–O
bond distances and bond valence sum (BVS) calculations and also from
calculated (using DFT) spin density at different cobalt centers. Magnetic
studies demonstrated that in each complex both cobalt(II) centers
are antiferromagnetically coupled through the μ1,3-azide bridge with J = −11.0 cm–1 (for complex 1) and −14.4 cm–1 (for complex 2). This was well supported by the DFT
calculations. This observation will obviously open up new interesting
possibilities in the synthesis of similar mixed-valence cobalt(III/II)
compounds of different nuclearity and diverse magnetic properties.
