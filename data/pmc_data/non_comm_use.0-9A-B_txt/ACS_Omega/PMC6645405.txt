Tailoring the morphological, chemical,
and physical properties
of vanadium oxides (VOx) is crucial to optimize their performance
in current and future applications. The present contribution proposes
a new route to obtain VOx nanofibers with different V4+/V5+ ratios and crystallinity. The method involves the
exclusive electrospinning of water-free NH4VO3-saturated solutions including a reductant. Subsequent air-annealing
under suitable conditions yields vanadium oxide fibers of 20–90
nm diameter and 10–50 m2/g surface area. The presence
of the reductant gives rise to VOx nanofibers with a considerable
proportion of V4+. Then, the right choice of the calcination
heating rate and temperature permits to modify the V4+/V5+ ratio as well as the crystalline phase and crystallite size
of the fibers. With the proposed methodology, long-range continuous
single-phase orthorhombic V2O5 and monoclinic
V3O7 nanofibers are obtained.

Introduction
Vanadium oxides (VOx)
constitute a unique family of materials with
large diversity of chemical and physical properties, which make them
important for basic research and various technological and industrial
applications.1−3 Particularly, those with formula VnO2n+1 (V2O5, V3O7, V4O9, and V6O13) present a wide range of layered structures
and phases, from amorphous to crystalline, which can reversibly intercalate
protons or alkali ions to form electronically conducting materials.4 These materials showing both ionic and electronic
conductivity are used as electrode materials in Li-ion batteries (LIBs),4−6 electrochromic devices,7,8 gas sensors,9 supercapacitors,10,11 etc.

Another outstanding feature of these oxides is their ability to
incorporate oxygen (O) vacancy defects and to form mixed-valence oxides.2,4 These O-vacancies have been found the energetically most favorable
adsorption sites for certain reactants,12 and their formation has been related to the ability of oxides to
act as catalysts for partial oxidation13−16 and reduction17 reactions. On the other hand, the presence of V4+ in some of these phases (V3O7, V4O9, and V6O13) has been found interesting
for different applications. First, although V5+ is nonmagnetic,
V4+ has spin S = 1/2.18 Second, the study of several V-based catalytic systems
revealed the necessity of having both V5+ and V4+ interconvertible species to obtain active and selective catalysts
for several partial oxidation reactions.19,20 For example, previous studies21,22 described how a V2O5-based catalyst becomes active and selective
when it has a certain V5+/V4+ ratio and transforms
into V3O7. Finally, it was found that the presence
of V4+ and the nonstoichiometry has a critical positive
effect on the reaction of VOx with lithium.23

Apart from the oxidation state and crystallinity, the morphology
and dimensions of the VOx materials play a key role on their performance.
Generally, nanodimensioned and nanostructured VOx shows higher and
more accessible surface area than the bulk counterpart, which is highly
beneficial for reaction efficiency and kinetics.5,6,10 In addition, the fibrous morphology enhances
mass transfer, low pressure drop, ease of handling and reduced interparticle
boundaries for several functional applications.24−26 Furthermore,
for applications requiring reversible intercalation of ions, like
LIBs, the nanoscale promotes facile strain relaxation upon insertion–extraction
cycling.4−6

Given such an extraordinary versatility on
properties and applications,
several studies have been carried out to design new VOx materials
and synthetic routes. Higher-temperature routes (T = 350–600 °C), like the thermal decomposition of NH4VO314,19,20 and chemical vapor deposition,3 usually
result in dense thermodynamically stable phases,27 mainly orthorhombic α-V2O5,
with poor control of the oxidation state or the morphology. By contrast,
the use of lower and milder temperature routes (T < 200 °C), like electrodeposition28 and sol–gel27 and hydrothermal29 techniques, respectively, allowing kinetic control
of crystal grown reactions, lead to more open metastable VOx phases,27 multiple nanoforms (nanofibers, nanotubes, etc.),
and certain control of the V4+/V5+ ratio.29 Nonetheless, because water is used as solvent
or present in most cases, these routes are generally restricted to
“double-layer” δ-type gels, xerogels or aerogels
(HxV4O10·nH2O or V2O5·nH2O), or crystalline monoclinic δ-V2O54 and orthorhombic
H2V3O8 (V3O7·H2O)30 phases. In addition,
only VOx nanoforms of low aspect ratio can be obtained.

Some
research groups have demonstrated that the combination of
previous routes with electrospinning successfully solves the problem
of discontinuity on VOx nanomaterials.5,6,31−35 However, the properties of the resulting VOx fibers (VFs) are greatly
limited by the solution formulation needed for the success of the
electrospinning process. Significantly, the preparation of continuous
VOx fibers with either diameter below 100 nm or variable vanadium
oxidation states is still challenging. In fact, the reported methods
to produce VOx phases with mixed V4+/V5+ oxidation
state, like V3O7 or V4O9, are quite complex and still date from the 1960s of the last century.36−38

In this work, we propose a new approach to produce VOx nanofibers,
allowing variable +4/+5 oxidation state and crystallinity, by electrospinning
and subsequent calcination of water-free NH4VO3 solutions in the presence of a suitable reductant. This two-step
synthesis procedure is outlined in Figure 1A. Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) was used as vanadium precursor. The benefits of using this
compound, instead of much more expensive organic-based precursors,6,31−34 to obtain electrospun VOx nanofibers were highlighted by Mai et
al.5 Nevertheless, this salt is insoluble
in many of the conventional polar solvents. Thus, when using water
as solvent, the authors did not obtain a homogeneous material but
instead obtained fibers made up of NH4VO3 nanoparticles
embedded into the poly(vinyl alcohol) matrix. Because of this inhomogeneity,
the size of the V2O5 nanoparticles after air-annealing,
was determined by that of insolubilized NH4VO3. Similarly, by using this route the vanadium oxidation state was
not controllable.

Results and Discussion
Preparation of VOx Nanofibers
Ethanol
is an excellent
alternative to water as a solvent in electrospinning processes. Basically,
it gathers a relatively high dielectric constant and volatility, promoting
the yield of regular fibers;39 it can be
sustainably produced from biomass, and it is relatively cheap and
not harmful. However, the solubility of NH4VO3 in ethanol is very low.40 The addition
of oxalic acid to the precursor solution greatly increased this solubility,
leading to homogeneity and sufficient consistency of the resulting
fibers after calcination. At the same time, this compound played a
key role as vanadium reductant (see below). Finally, poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) and another solvent, dimethylformamide (DMF), were introduced
to improve the spinnability of the ethanolic solutions.

A freshly
prepared spinnable precursor solution, with composition NH4VO3/ethanol/DMF/PVP = 1:9:9:4 and the necessary oxalic
acid, was electrospun into NH4VO3/PVP nanofibers
(Figure 1A). Details
on this procedure can be found in the Experimental
Section. TEM characterization reveals that this material consists
of long-range continuous and defect-free fibers (Figure 1B), with diameters ranging
between 20 and 90 nm (Figure 1C). The diameters of these precalcined fibers are smaller
and show narrower diameter distribution than those reported in the
literature prepared by similar procedures.5,6,10,31−34 On the other hand, the lack of characteristic features in the selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 1C) indicates that these fibers
are amorphous. For the preparation of the different VOx nanofibers,
the electrospun NH4VO3/PVP fibers were heat-treated
under air atmosphere at different conditions previously studied by
thermogravimetry (TG) (see Supporting Information (SI)).

TEM Characterization of VOx Nanofibers
The fibers calcined
at the lowest temperature (VF-300-0.2) keep practically the regular
morphology (Figure 2A,B) of the precalcined ones (Figure 1). When the calcination is carried out at 350 °C
and 0.2 °C/min (VF-350-0.2), fibers with more irregular shape
and diameter are obtained, probably due to a greater decomposition
of the polymer matrix (Figure 2D,E). The magnified images clearly show the presence of dark
spots or grains in these fibers (Figure 2E). The increase in the heating rate (HR)
to 0.5 °C/min (VF-350-0.5) results in continuous and regular
fibers made up of interconnected and well-defined small particles/crystallites
of ca. 15–40 nm (Figure 2G,H). Finally, a greater increase in the temperature of up
to 400 °C (VF-400-0.2) produces fibers with larger crystallites
and diameter, which make them less discernible (Figure 2J,K).

Figure 2 TEM images and SAED patterns of VF-300-0.2
(A–C), VF-350-0.2
(D–F), VF-350-0.5 (G–I), and VF-400-0.2 (J−L).

Textural Properties of
VOx Nanofibers
N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms at −196 °C of
the VOx nanofibers (SI) indicated that
the samples are mainly macroporous, with Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas in the range 10–50 m2/g and
a mesoporous volume from 0.01 to 0.08 cm3/g (Table 1). These surface areas are quite
high for bulk oxide materials and may be easily accessible considering
the ultrafine diameter of the obtained nanofibers.26 These properties are very attractive for multiple applications.

Table 1 Textural Parameters, Surface Composition,
and Main Crystalline Data of the VOx Nanofibers
 	N2 adsorption	XPS	XRD	
sample	ABET (m2/g)	Vmeso (cm3/g)	V/O	V4+/V5+	structure	crystal size (Å)	
VF-300-0.2	48.5	0.08	0.330	0.303	amorphous	 	
VF-350-0.2	12.4	0.01	0.450	0.362	V3O7	143.0	
VF-350-0.5	27.7	0.04	0.473	0.096	V2O5	287.0	
VF-400-0.2	40.0	0.08	0.553	0.060	V2O5	557.1	
Considering that the dimensions and morphology of
the different
fibers are quite similar, the observed differences on ABET may be explained in terms of the porous structure
(shape, size, number of pores, cracks, etc.) developed upon thermal
decomposition of the different precursors in the fibers. Specially,
a large number of pores can be formed in the organic matrix. This
would explain the highest ABET found for
the sample (VF-300-0.2) with higher residuary C (see below) and its
marked decrease when further decomposition occurs (VF-350-0.2). On
the other hand, a complete removal of this matrix may reduce the diameter
and leave empty voids around the nascent VOx crystals, explaining
the relative increase of ABET for VF-350-0.5
and VF-400-0.2.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) Characterization
of VOx
Nanofibers
Figure 3 shows the V 2p spectra of the VOx nanofibers, which display
the characteristic V 2p1/2 and V 2p3/2 spin–orbit
components separated at 7.4 ± 0.5 eV. The V 2p3/2 peaks
of the XPS spectra were deconvoluted to estimate the contribution
of vanadium species. For deconvolution, only the contributions of
V5+ (around 517 eV) and V4+ (close to 516 eV)
were considered,1,41 obtaining a good fitting of the
experimental results.

Figure 3 V 2p core-level XPS spectra of the different VOx nanofibers.

Although the presence of some
V3+ in the samples should
not be ruled out, this was supported by the X-ray diffraction (XRD),
Raman, and SAED results, in which only V5+/V4+ mixed phases were found (see below).

The V/O and V4+/V5+ atomic ratios of the
different samples are collected in Table 1. The increase in the calcination temperature
causes an increase in the surface V/O atomic ratio, surpassing that
of V2O5 from 350 °C. Thus, the exact chemical
formula of the different materials can be calculated as VO3.0, VO2.2, VO2.1, and VO1.8, for VF-300-0.2,
VF-350-0.2, VF-350-0.5, and VF-400-0.2, respectively, although part
of the accounted oxygen may come from the remaining organic matrix.

The analysis of the V 2p core-level spectrum revealed the presence
of a varying amount of V4+. Extraordinarily, the fibers
calcined at 300–350 °C and 0.2 °C/min display a remarkable
surface V4+/V5+ ratio (ca. one-third). This
coexistence of V4+ and V5+ species is characteristic
of mixed-valence VOx. Given that the initial oxidation state of vanadium
in NH4VO3 is V5+, the large contribution
of V4+ may be associated with the reducing power of the
organic compounds, i.e., oxalic acid42 and
PVP,43 present in the electrospun NH4VO3/PVP fibers. The well-known reducing effects
of oxalic acid on the synthesis of mixed-valence supported vanadium
oxide catalysts occur in the absence of PVP. Therefore, it is expected
that the role of oxalic acid as a reductant in the reported preparation
method must be important. Nevertheless, appropriate controlled experiments
should be carried out to discern the reduction action of each organic
compound. Remarkably, the rise in the heating rate or calcination
temperature reduces the proportion of V4+, so fibers with
different V4+/V5+ ratio are obtained. Considering
the vanadium oxidation state, the chemical formula would be V(IV)0.23V(V)0.77O3.0, V(IV)0.27V(V)0.73O2.2, V(IV)0.09V(V)0.91O2.1, and V(IV)0.06V(V)0.94O1.8, for VF-300-0.2, VF-350-0.2, VF-350-0.5, and VF-400-0.2,
respectively.

Apart from V and O, residuary C and N were detected
by XPS on the
surface of all the calcined samples (see SI). These species were assigned to unreacted PVP or NH4VO3 and could affect the properties of the VOx nanofibers.
The obtained results show that the concentration of these elements
decreased with the calcination temperature and heating rate, suggesting
that a suitable adjustment of the variable calcination parameters
may permit their complete elimination.

Raman Analysis
Figure 4 shows the
Raman spectra of the samples. VF-400-0.2
and VF-350-0.5 (see SI) spectra display
clear bands at 143, 283, 302, 405, 480, 526, 698, and 994 cm–1, which are characteristic of pure V2O5.44 By contrast, the Raman spectrum of VF-350-0.2
sample is quite different. Although it also shows the features of
V2O5 phase, their intensity is considerably
lower than in VF-400-0.2 and VF-350-0.5 samples. Regarding that V2O5 is a high Raman scatter; these facts suggest
that V2O5 may be a minority phase in this sample.
On the other hand, the spectrum also shows exclusive features. The
band near 1020 cm–1, that redshifts upon hydration,
is characteristic of V5+=O stretching mode in supported
vanadium oxide species.19,45 The bands near 900
cm–1 have been associated with the stretching V4+=O bond.19,44 VF-300-0.2 and VF-350-0.2
samples show two broad bands near 1350 and 1580 cm–1, which are assigned to C–H and C=O and/or C–N
bonds, respectively.45,46 This indicates that a considerable
part of PVP has not been decomposed at 300 °C. The intensity
of these bands decrease or they disappear with the calcination temperature
and heating rate. All these results are in line with XPS and the TG
study (SI).

VF-350-0.2, and VF-400-0.2 (practically identical to that of VF-350-0.5,
see SI) nanofibers.

X-ray and Electron Diffraction
XRD (Figure 5) and SAED (Figure 2) characterizations reflected
the crystalline nature of samples calcined at or above 350 °C.
By contrast, the absence of diffraction features (Figures 5 and 2C) pointed out the amorphous structure of fibers yielded at lower
temperatures. Particularly, the Bragg angles of diffraction peaks
of VF-350-0.2 sample (Figure 5) fit well with those of the V3O7 pattern
(JCPDS 98-000-2338), which crystallizes in the monoclinic structure
with C2/c symmetry. This agrees with the SAED pattern of this material
(Figure 2F), showing
ring-like features corresponding to some of the characteristic crystallographic
planes of V3O7. Interestingly, the theoretical
V/O atomic ratio for this phase (0.430) is quite close to that estimated
by XPS (Table 1). On
the other hand, the X-ray (Figure 5) and electron diffraction patterns (Figure 2I,L) of VF-350-0.5 and VF-400-0.2
match with that of orthorhombic (Pmnm) V2O5 phase (JCPDS 01-085-0601). These results closely agree
with Raman and XPS data. It is noteworthy to highlight the high reproducibility
of the method to obtain these materials (SI).

Figure 5 X-ray diffractograms of the different samples and standard patterns.

It is interesting that the crystalline
phases of samples calcined
with different heating rates (VF-350-0.2 and VF-350-0.5) are entirely
different. This is assigned to the different reaction kinetics: the
faster treatment avoids the yield of a significant proportion of V4+, leading to V2O5 phase, whereas a
much slower heating seems to permit the reduction of V5+ into V4+ and the formation of V3O7 phase. This occurs if the final temperature is not too high because
slowly heating up to 400 °C (VF-400-0.2) results in complete
oxidation of vanadium and the formation of V2O5 phase. On the other hand, anhydrous crystalline phases are obtained
in all cases because of the absence of water in the spinnable precursor
solution.

Table 1 also includes
the average crystallite size of the different samples calculated from
XRD patterns. As can be observed, the crystallite size gradually increases
with the calcination temperature or heating rate, enabling to obtain
a similar crystalline phase, for example V2O5, with different crystallite sizes. Such a difference in crystallite
sizes is also deduced from the different intensity of SAED patterns
of these samples (Figure 2F,I,L). Consequently, the obtained results show that the right
choice of heating conditions allows obtaining VOx nanofibers with
different V4+/V5+ ratios, crystalline phase,
and crystal size.

Conclusions
In summary, long-range
continuous single-phase orthorhombic V2O5 and
monoclinic V3O7 nanofibers
have been prepared by electrospinning of water-free NH4VO3-saturated solutions including oxalic acid. The efficient
incorporation of this compound, which acts as NH4VO3 solubilizer and reductant, results in VOx nanofibers with
a considerable proportion of V4+. Further thermal treatment
of these fibers permits to decrease the V4+/V5+ ratio. This opens the possibility to obtain long-aspect fibrous
materials with different crystalline phases that are difficult to
obtain by conventional methods. By the optimization of the parameters
of this synthetic route, e.g., the nature and concentration of the
reductant, the calcination conditions, etc., it is expected to obtain
other interesting mixed-valence VOx materials. Hence, the reported
procedure is considered a powerful tool for the design of new materials
for catalytic, optical, and electrochemical applications.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All chemicals were analytical grade and used
as received. Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3)
(99%, Sigma Aldrich), ethanol (J.T. Baker), poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) (Sigma Aldrich), anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.8%, Sigma
Aldrich), oxalic acid dihydrate (H2C2O4·2H2O) (Scharlau).

Preparation Procedure
In a typical synthesis, 0.25
g of NH4VO3 was dissolved in 8.5 g of solvent
(ethanol/DMF = 1:1). To increase the salt solubility, oxalic acid
was added and the mixture was ultrasonicated at 45 °C, obtaining
a brown-yellow solution. This substance acts as a chelating agent
forming (NH4)2[VO(C2O4)2].47 The amount of oxalic
acid was the minimum necessary to increase the solubility of NH4VO3 because any excess entails an excessive conductivity
of the solution as well as the corrosion of the needle. After complete
dissolution, 1 g of PVP was added to the solution, which was magnetically
stirred for 2 h to obtain a homogeneous dark-green gelled solution
suitable for electrospinning.

For the electrospinning process,
the precursor solution was flowed at 0.5 cm3/h through
the capillary tip of a single spinneret downward to a square plate
used as a fiber collector. Both the spinneret and the collector were
made of stainless steel. The tip-to-collector distance was 15 cm,
and the electrical potential difference was 16 kV (the collector was
at −8 kV and the tip at +8 kV). The electrospun NH4VO3/PVP nanofibers were collected in the form of a nonwoven
mesh.

For the preparation of the different VOx fibers (VFs),
the electrospun
NH4VO3/PVP fibers were heat-treated under air
atmosphere at different conditions in a horizontal furnace, with the
air gas flowed at 150 cm3(STP)/min. Once the final temperature
was reached, the crucible was slowly extracted and let to cool down
at the lab atmosphere. The effect of the heating rate (HR = 0.2; 0.5
and 1.0 °C/min) and final temperature (T = 300,
350, and 400 °C) on the calcination of the resulting fibers (denoted
as VF-T-HR) was analyzed by different techniques.

Characterization
The diameter and morphology of the
different fibers were characterized by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns
were obtained by a Philips CM200 microscope at an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV.

Nonisothermal thermogravimetric analyses were carried
out in a CI Electronics balance (model MK2) under air atmosphere (150
cm3 (STP)/min). The sample mass was approximately 10 mg
and the sample temperature was increased from room temperature up
to 900 °C at 10 °C/min.

The textural properties were
analyzed by N2 adsorption–desorption
at −196 °C in a Micromeritics ASAP2020. Samples were previously
outgassed for 8 h at 150 °C under vacuum. From the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm, the apparent surface area
(ABET) was determined by applying the
BET equation and the mesopore volume (Vmeso) was determined as the difference between the adsorbed volume at
a relative pressure of 0.95 and the micropore volume (Vt) calculated by the t-method.48

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analyses were obtained by
using a 5700 C model Physical Electronics apparatus, with Mg Kα
radiation (1253.6 eV). For the analysis of the XPS peaks, the C 1s
peak position was set at 284.5 eV and used as a reference to position
the other peaks. The fitting of the XPS peaks was done by least squares
using Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shapes. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of samples were acquired by a Philips X’Pert PROMPD
diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
The X-ray generator was set at 45 kV and 40 mA. The crystallite size
of the V2O5 crystalline samples was accurately
calculated by the Rietveld refinement method using the Williamson–Hall
equation,49 whereas that of V3O7 was determined by the Scherrer equation.50

Raman spectra were collected with a single-monochromator
Raman
spectrometer (Renishaw Micro-Raman System 1000) equipped with a cooled
charge-coupled device detector (−73 °C) and an edge filter,
which removes the elastic scattering. The samples were excited with
the 488 nm line from an Ar+ laser operating at 10 mW. The
spectral resolution was ca. 4 cm–1, and the spectra
acquisition consisted of 10 accumulations of 30 s each. The spectra
were obtained under dehydrated conditions (50 mL/min synthetic air,
ca. ambient temperature −120 °C) in a hot stage (Linkam
TS-1500).
