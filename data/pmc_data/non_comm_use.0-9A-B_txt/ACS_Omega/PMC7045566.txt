To
fully understand the chemical structure of graphene oxide and
the oxidation chemistry of sp2 carbon sites, we conducted
a practical experiment and density functional theory combined study
on the oxidation process of graphite. The nuclear magnetic resonance,
thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results
of unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite indicate that the oxidation process
involves the intercalating oxidation, where electrically neutral species
is the oxidizing agent, and the diffusive-oxidation, where MnO3+ is the oxidizing agent. An intrinsic formation
and conversion path of oxygen-containing functional groups is proposed
based on the experimental results and further interpreted with the
aid of frontier molecular orbital theory and density functional theory.
Meanwhile, the two unique features of the oxidation process of graphite,
the chemistry stability of oxygen-containing functional groups in
the strong oxidizing medium, and the self-regulation of the oxidation
process are theoretically reasoned.

1 Introduction
Carbon-based
materials have been playing significant roles in defining
the research and applications of nanoscience and nanotechnology.1,2 Their fabrication and functionalization have facilitated massive
interdisciplinary research involving chemistry, physics, and materials.3,4 Oxidation is one of the most basic routes to manipulating the carbon-based
materials by functionalizing the chemically inert, sp2 hybridized
carbon structure.5,6 To realize the desired functionalization
of carbon-based materials, controlled oxidation reactions are critical
to a low density of lattice defects during carbon evolution.7,8 With more than 160 years of synthesis history, the fabrication of
graphite oxide (GO) is the most typical oxidation reaction of carbon-based
materials.9,10 To synthesize GO with controlled chemical
composition and properties, various processes and oxidizing agents
have been attempted for the oxidation of graphite.11−13 Nevertheless,
the details of the chemical structure of GO and the oxidation chemistry
of sp2 carbon sites have not been fully understood,14,15 which essentially hinders the success of usage of the surface chemistry
of GO and the correct acquaintance of the fundamental oxidation perspectives
of carbon-based materials.

To reveal the fine chemical structure
of GO and the oxidation chemistry
of sp2 carbon sites, generations of chemists have tried
to propose a suitable structural model.16−21 The most recognized Lerf–Klinowski (LK) structural model
concludes that GO is a highly functionalized graphite with randomly
distributed oxidized domains containing epoxy and hydroxyl groups
on the basal planes and carboxyl and hydroxyl groups at the edges.20 The atomic-level resolution transmission electron
microscopy images confirmed that the oxidized domains form a continuous
network and the graphitic domains form isolated islands.22,23 The solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) characterization
also shows that the major functional groups situating on the basal
plane of GO are C–OH and epoxide. Carbonyl is spatially separated
from the majority sp2, C–OH and epoxide carbons,
indicating that carbonyl groups mainly distribute at the edge.24,25 Nevertheless, because of the complexity of the oxidizing system
and the chemical instability of GO, the published works still cannot
completely resolve the mystery of the oxidation process and the GO
chemistry.

There are several unrevealed questions for the oxidation
process
of graphite: (i) What is the intrinsic formation and conversion path
of the oxygen-containing functional groups on GO? Several groups proposed
that epoxy is the primary functional group, and the local strain induced
by the oxygen-containing functional groups results in the cutting
of graphene sheets.26−28 After exposure to water, acid catalyzes the hydrolysis
of epoxide to form hydroxyl groups.29,30 Chen et al.
proposed that epoxy and hydroxyl groups can be formed by directly
attacking graphite sheets with •O• and HO• radicals.31 (ii) How can the oxygen-containing functional groups be stabilized
in the strong oxidizing medium? The oxidized domains decorated with
reactive functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl groups should
be unstable in the strong oxidizing system. While during the oxidation
process, the GO composition and the structure do not change significantly
after reaching a threshold oxidation degree,32,33 implying the chemical stability of functional groups in the oxidizing
medium. (iii) Why does GO consist of randomly distributed oxidized
domains and graphitic domains? Manipulation of the stoichiometry of
GO tailors its optoelectronic and physicochemical properties.7,8 The formation mechanism and size control of the graphitic and oxidized
domains should be of great importance for the synthesis of GO with
tunable properties.

In this work, we have carefully prepared
unhydrolyzed oxidized
graphite to avoid the interference of water and other impurities,
and the chemistry of oxidized graphite has been scrutinized by the
most relevant characterization techniques. We also have considered
the chemical reactivity of interim oxidized products and the energy
variation during the graphite oxidation in order to understand the
chemistry stability of oxygen-containing functional groups in the
strong oxidizing medium and the self-regulating feature of the oxidation
process. We aim to determine the main oxidizing agent species and
an intrinsic formation and conversion path of oxygen-containing functional
groups, which have to be consistent with the experimental observations,
characterization results, and theoretical calculations.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Identification of the Oxidizing
Agents
For the modified Hummers’ method, the identity
of the specific
oxidizing species that attacks graphite seems to be still in controversy.
Thus far, the proposed oxidizing species in the H2SO4–KMnO4 medium include Mn2O7, MnO3+, MnO4–, O3, and some radicals such as •O•. Lerf et al. suggested that the oxidizing species
is a nucleophile, which should be MnO4–.20 Dreyer et al. proposed that the active
oxidizing species is M2O7, which is sensitive
to high temperature and organic compounds.15 Dimiev et al. mentioned that in H2SO4, the
Mn(VII) most likely exists in the form of a MnO3+ cation, which closely associates with HSO4– and SO42– ions in the forms of MnO3HSO4 or (MnO3)2SO4.34 Chen et al. proposed that epoxy and
hydroxyl groups can be formed by directly attacking graphite sheets
with •O• and HO• radicals.31

However, the main oxidizing
species should not be a nucleophile or an electrically neutral species.
The oxidation of graphite is a self-regulating process, as the GO
composition and the structure do not change significantly with the
addition of an excess oxidizing agent after reaching a certain threshold
oxidation degree.32,33 Sulfuric acid with pKa = −10 is considered strong and can easily donate
proton. According to the Brønsted–Lowry acid–base
theory, in the concentrated sulfuric acid, part of the oxygen-containing
functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl groups will become conjugate
acids with Keq ≫ 1 (see detailed
calculation in Supporting Information,
Discussion S1), and the corresponding domain will carry positive charges
by the induction effect. If the oxidizing species is a nucleophile
MnO4–, it will violently react with the
as-formed conjugate acids and the positively charged domain. In such
case, the oxygen-containing functional groups should not be stable
in the oxidizing medium, which is in conflict with the experimental
results. Research evidenced that GO consists of aromatic domains with
sp2-hybridized carbon atoms and nonaromatic oxidized domains
with an sp3-hybridized carbon structure. If the oxidizing
agents do not carry charges, such as Mn2O7 and •O•, the oxidation reaction sites
will be random, and the formed oxygen-containing functional groups
can be further oxidized by the oxidizing agent. In this case, the
oxidation degree of GO will increase with the reaction time and does
not have a threshold oxidation degree. Therefore, the main active
oxidizing species must carry a positive charge, and only MnO3+ meets this principle.

The substrate for the electrophilic
addition reaction of the oxidizing
agent MnO3+ is the sulfuric acid-graphite intercalation
compound (H2SO4-GIC). H2SO4-GIC, also known as graphite sulfate, is formed by the intercalation
of HSO4– and H2SO4 and has the characteristic diffraction peak at 22.5° (7.98
Å) (Figure 1a).35−37 The ideal structure of H2SO4-GIC was revealed
as (C24+(HSO4–)(H2SO4)2)n.38,39 Hence, it seems impossible for the electrophile MnO3+ to intercalate into the interlayer spaces of the positively
charged carbon skeleton of H2SO4-GIC and oxidize
it. Actually, H2SO4-GIC is not just an ionic
compound formed by the intercalation of HSO4– and H2SO4 between the layers of the graphite
matrix; it also contains a small amount of oxygen-containing functional
groups formed on the basal plane of graphite sheets.39,40 As depicted by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of the
solvent-washed H2SO4-GIC sample (Figure 1b), besides the weight loss
of HSO4– and H2SO4 at around 450 °C, the weight loss between 150 and 170 °C
is because of the decomposition of the labile oxygen-containing functional
groups such as hydroxyl and epoxide groups.35,41 The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of the H2SO4-GIC sample also shows a small peak at 286.5 eV coming from the C–O
bond and another small peak at 288.8 eV coming from the C=O
bond (Figure 1c). The
low degree oxidation of H2SO4-GIC can be attributed
to the intercalation of an electrically neutral oxidizing agent into
the graphite layers. We name this early oxidation of H2SO4-GIC that occurs in the intercalation step as intercalating-oxidation
to distinguish it from the diffusive-oxidation that occurs during
the diffusion process, where MnO3+ is functioning
as the main oxidizing species. The intercalating-oxidation is the
origin of the diffusive-oxidation of H2SO4-GIC.
It damages the aromatic carbon skeleton and transfers the charge of
H2SO4-GIC by the formation of oxygen-containing
functional groups and thus enables the diffusion of the electrophile
MnO3+ into the interlayer of H2SO4-GIC through electron-rich domains. The 13C SSNMR
spectrum of H2SO4-GIC also suggests the existence
of intercalating oxidation. As shown in Figure 1d, besides the resonance signal of sp2 conjugation carbon and C=O bond appearing at 127.0
and 165.5 ppm, respectively,42 a resonance
signal at 135.0 ppm can be attributed to the formation of an isolated
sp2 carbon pair.43 The intercalating-oxidation
process of the electrically neutral oxidizing agent and subsequent
diffusive-oxidation process of the electrophile also can be illustrated
by another oxidation experiment (see detailed experiment procedure
and results analysis in Supporting Information, Discussion S2 and Figure S1). Once the electrophile MnO3+ starts to attack the carbon skeleton, formed oxygen-containing
functional groups will stop the electrically neutral oxidizing agent
from diffusing into the interlayer of H2SO4-GIC
with the steric hindrance effect, so the system enters the diffusive-oxidation
stage and exhibits the self-regulating feature of graphite oxidation.

H2SO4-GIC.

2.2 Formation and Conversion Path of Oxygen-Containing
Functional Groups
The diffusion of the oxidizing agent MnO3+ into the interlayer galleries of H2SO4-GIC and subsequent electrophilic attack on the carbon
skeleton result in the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups.
These functional groups and their conversion path in strong acidic
oxidizing medium need to be experimentally examined in order to reveal
the oxidation chemistry of graphite. In the modified Hummers’
method, the oxidized graphite is usually washed by deionized water
to remove the remaining oxidizing agent. However, the hydrolyzed sample
does not contain the genuine chemical composition of oxidized graphite
because it reacts with water constantly.29,32 Dimiev et al. introduced a new purification protocol to prepare
pristine GO, while the H2O2 aqueous solution
was inevitably added to remove Mn7+ and MnO2.32 We thus developed a unique method
to prepare the fully unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite (Experimental and Computational Methods section), and the prepared samples are free of impurities
of MnSO4 and K2SO4 (Figure S2). The unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite samples were
characterized by 13C SSNMR, TGA, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) to reveal the genuine chemical composition of oxidized
graphite.

Figure 2a shows the 13C SSNMR spectra of the solvent-washed oxidized
graphite. For the partly oxidized graphite sample (A2, 24 min), in
addition to the signal of the aromatic carbon skeleton and the C=O
bond, new resonance signals arise at 56 and 85 ppm, assignable to
the epoxide and monosulfate, respectively.24,32 In addition, a new resonance signal appears at 97 ppm, which may
be caused by the carbons of five- and six-membered-ring lactols.44 With the oxidation degree of graphite further
increasing, the relative peak intensity of epoxide (56 ppm) shows
a notable increasing accompanied by the decrease of monosulfate (85
ppm) and C=O bond (165.5 ppm). For the fully oxidized graphite
sample (A8, 96 min), the resonance signal of sp2 conjugation
carbon at 135.0 ppm is weakened because of the formation of oxygen-containing
functional groups. Correspondingly, the intensity of the epoxide signal
at 61 ppm reaches a maximum intensity.

C–C/C=C bonds corresponding to various forms of C atoms
deconvolved from C 1s spectra in Figure S4.

The TGA analysis of unhydrolyzed
oxidized graphite also provides
useful information on the composition of samples. As shown in Figure 2b, all the oxidized
graphite samples show two major weight losses. The first major weight
loss happens between 150 and 170 °C because of the decomposition
of the labile oxygen-containing functional groups such as hydroxyl
and epoxide groups.41 The rapid exothermic
process in this temperature range corresponds to the substantial emission
of CO2/CO from the thermal decomposition of epoxy functional
groups (Figure S3). The second major weight
loss between 250 and 280 °C can be attributed to the decomposition
of monosulfate, as reported by Eigler et al.40,45 The weight loss in both temperature windows increases with the oxidation
degree, indicating that formation of hydroxyl and epoxide groups as
well as monosulfate is a continuous process.

The atomic fraction
of composition elements obtained from XPS was
investigated to reflect the composition evolution during the oxidation
process (Figure 2c).
With the increase of the oxidation degree, the atomic fraction of
C atoms declines, while those of O and S increase, indicating that
the formation of monosulfate is accompanied with the whole oxidation
process. Combining them with the quantitative atomic fraction of oxygen-containing
groups and C–C/C=C bonds (Figure 2d), it can be calculated that the content
of monosulfate accounts for 23.4% of the C–O bonds for the
fully oxidized graphite. In addition, the content of the C=O
bond remains almost stable through the whole oxidation process (Figure 2d), which indicates
that the carbonyl and carboxyl groups mainly forms during the intercalating-oxidation
stage of H2SO4-GIC.

The above characterization
results show that the diffusive-oxidation
originates from the electrophilic attack of MnO3+ on H2SO4-GIC in the medium of HSO4– and H2SO4, and the formed
oxygen-containing functional groups are mainly hydroxyl and epoxide
groups, as well as monosulfate.32,45 Based on the experimental
results, we proposed an intrinsic formation and conversion path of
oxygen-containing functional groups during the graphite oxidation
process as follows: after the Mn atom at the positive charge center
acts as an electrophile to attack the nonaromatic graphite domain,
epoxide groups are formed; in the medium of concentrated sulfuric
acid, the as-formed epoxy groups are protonated to oxonium ions, namely
[C2OH]+, forming conjugate acid-base pair with
HSO4–; the as-formed oxonium ions transopen
to form monosulfate and hydroxyl groups at ortho-positions because
the α-carbon atom, which bonds to OH+, has the lowest
electron density (Figure S5) and is susceptible
to the nucleophilic addition of HSO4–. Figure 3 schematically
illustrates the intrinsic formation and conversion path of oxygen-containing
functional groups with three interim oxidized products (epoxy-GO,
oxonium-GO, and sulfate-GO).

and conversion
path of oxygen-containing functional groups on oxidized graphite with
three interim oxidized products (epoxy-GO, oxonium-GO, and sulfate-GO).

2.3 Stability of Oxygen-Containing
Functional
Groups in Strong Oxidizing Medium
In addition to the experimental
evidence, we also attempted to interpret the proposed intrinsic formation
and conversion path with theoretical support and reveal the reasons
behind the unique features of the oxidation process of graphite. We
first researched the chemical reactivity of each entity with the frontier
molecular orbital (FMO) theory, which helped us to understand the
chemistry stability of oxygen-containing functional groups in strong
oxidizing medium. Table 1 lists the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) spatial distribution and energy of MnO3+, H2SO4-GIC, and oxidized
microdomains containing different functional groups. In a redox reaction,
the HOMO reflects the electron losing potential of a reducing agent,
while the LUMO reflects the electron capturing potential of an oxidizing
agent.46 The H2SO4-GIC shows delocalized electrons across the conjugated π bonds
of an aromatic structure and is capable of electron transfer. The
LUMO energy of MnO3+ is −14.37 eV, indicating
its high oxidizing strength. The LUMO spatial distribution of MnO3+ overlaps with the HOMO spatial distribution of
H2SO4-GIC through σ bonding, which allows
π electrons to transfer from the HOMO of H2SO4-GIC to the LUMO of the oxidizing agent MnO3+, forming a C–O(MnO2)–C bond on the
basal plane of H2SO4-GIC through the electrophilic
addition reaction. The subsequent cleavage of the Mn–O bond
results in the formation of epoxide on the basal plane of H2SO4-GIC and the solid byproduct MnO2. After
the formation of epoxy group, the HOMO energy becomes −4.70
eV (Table 1, epoxy-GO),
slightly lower than that of H2SO4-GIC (−4.93
eV). The formation of the epoxy group leads to the activation of six-membered
rings in the form of sp2 to sp3 conversion.

Table 1 HOMO and LUMO Spatial Distribution
and Energy of the Oxidizing Agent and the Simulated Interim Products
for the Oxidation of Graphite
The as-formed epoxy group can be protonated to an
oxonium ion [C2OH]+ in the medium of concentrated
sulfuric acid,
forming a conjugate acid-base pair with HSO4–. The electron cloud gathers around the positively charged oxonium
ion because of the inductive effect, which causes the adjacent aromatic
carbons to carry positive charges. The positive charges on the oxonium
ion and aromatic carbons can repel the oxidizing agent MnO3+ and thus hinder their further oxidation. The HOMO energy
of oxonium-GO increases to −7.47 eV (Table 1, oxonium-GO), reflecting a low potential
of losing electrons, and the oxidized microdomain thus gets passivated.

However, as depicted in the LUMO spatial distribution of oxonium-GO,
the α-carbon carries the positive charge, which is responsible
for the instability of [C2OH]+ in the medium
of sulfuric acid and the cleavage of a part of C–O bonds by
nucleophilic attack to form monosulfate and trans-hydroxyl groups.
The formation of monosulfate and trans-hydroxyl groups from the nucleophilic
attack on [C2OH]+ results in the change of HOMO
energy of the oxidized microdomain to −4.68 eV (Table 1, sulfate-GO), so the oxidized
microdomain gets activated because of the cleavage of the oxonium
ion, and the carbon skeleton can be further oxidized by the oxidizing
agent MnO3+. The further oxidation reaction
preferentially occurs at the activated sites with an anti-Hückel
structure through para-position addition reaction.

As shown
in the HOMO spatial distribution of sulfate-GO, the monosulfate
−OSO3H lacks a molecular orbital, which matches
with the energy level of an oxidizing agent MnO3+, so it is chemically inert. Furthermore, the steric hindrance effect
from the tetrahedral structure of monosulfate hinders the collision
of its C–O bond with the oxidizing agent MnO3+, which accounts for the stability of nearby oxygen-containing
functional groups in the strong oxidizing medium. In addition, similar
with the formation process of the oxonium ion [C2OH]+, the trans-hydroxyl can be protonated to form [OH2]+ in the medium of sulfuric acid, avoiding further oxidation
by MnO3+.

2.4 Self-Regulating
Feature of Graphite Oxidation
We also studied the proposed
formation and conversion path from
the point of view of energy, which helped to explain the self-regulating
feature of graphite oxidation. The oxidization of graphite by the
modified Hummers’ method is a spontaneous process. To investigate
the energy variation of the system, the Gibbs free energy (ΔrGmθ) of each oxidation
process (the formation of epoxy-GO, oxonium-GO, and sulfate-GO) was
calculated by using the calculated standard Gibbs free energy of formation
(ΔfGmθ) of each reactant and an interim oxidized product (see detailed
calculation process in Supporting Information, Calculation data S1). The complex process of functionalization
is rationally divided into two possible routes, and the corresponding
Gibbs free energy (Figures 4 and S6) was calculated based on
the simulated model of 19 six-membered carbon rings. For the epoxidation
of H2SO4-GIC, the reactants are graphite supercell
and MnO3+, and the oxidized graphite can be
divided into the infinitely extended aromatic domains and nonaromatic
oxidized microdomains, which carries a part of the positive charge
from MnO3+. On Route 1, the positive charge
can transfer from the oxidized microdomains to the aromatic domains
through conjugated π bonds, and the corresponding free energy
is −10.87 eV. In other words, the carbon skeleton with an intact
conjugation structure tends to donate one electron to the oxidized
microdomains. The oxidized microdomains will advance toward the aromatic
domains until the carried charge of aromatic domains reaches the redox
potential of HSO4– (E° = 2.01 V for HSO4–/HSO4•). For the
protonation process of an epoxide to an oxonium ion, the calculated
free energy varies from −10.87 to −12.32 eV, releasing
1.45 eV energy. During the conversion of oxonium ion to monosulfate
and trans-hydroxyl groups, the ring-opening reaction of the oxonium
ion in the medium of sulfuric acid is an exothermic process, and the
released energy is 3.17 eV.

Figure 4 Gibbs free energy of the simulated interim products
with two routes
of the oxidation process obtained by DFT calculations.

However, the oxidized microdomains will not infinitely advance
toward the aromatic domains because the carried positive charge numbers
of the aromatic domains can significantly affect its charge acceptance.
For the 19-ring aromatic domain, which carries one positive charge,
the conversion of it to the ground-state consumes 3.52 eV free energy.
The conversion of aromatic domains with two positive charges to the
ground-state consumes 14.56 eV free energy, which is larger than the
energy 10.87 eV released from the epoxidation process of graphite,
so the two positive charges is the threshold for the 19-ring aromatic
domain. In this case, the epoxidation on Route 1 gets self-terminated
and switches to Route 2. Therefore, the oxidation of the aromatic
domain is self-regulated by its carried positive charge. On Route
2, the positive charge cannot transfer from the oxidized microdomains
to the aromatic domains, and the corresponding Gibbs free energy is
−5.21 eV. Because of the charge repulsion, the epoxy groups
formed on Route 2 will not be protonated to oxonium ions but can be
converted to monosulfate and hydroxyl groups. The ring-opening of
epoxide propels the removal of the positive charge accumulated on
the oxidized domain so that the oxidation will continue till the content
of the monosulfate reaches its maximum, that is to say, all the epoxy
groups are under the steric shielding of monosulfate.

The oxidation
of aromatic domains is self-terminated after the
carried charge of aromatic domains reaches the redox potential of
HSO4–. As a result, the area of the aromatic
islands is dependent on the concentration of HSO4–, and it decreases with the increase of HSO4– content. This is why a high oxidation degree of GO can generally
be obtained using modified Hummers’ method, which applies auxiliary
agents such as H3PO4, HNO3, H2O, and so forth and thus provides sufficient conjugate base
of HSO4–.11−13,30

3 Conclusions
The oxidation of graphite
by the modified Hummers’ method
has been investigated through a combination of theoretical calculations
and practical experiments. The major results are as follows:1. The oxidizing
agent MnO3+ is identified by its electrophilic
nature. The intercalating-oxidation
process damages the aromatic carbon skeleton of H2SO4-GIC and provides the origin for the diffusion and electrophilic
addition of MnO3+.

2. The SSNMR, TGA, and XPS analyses of
unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite indicate that the formed oxygen-containing
functional groups are mainly hydroxyl and epoxide groups, as well
as monosulfate. The intrinsic formation and conversion path of oxygen-containing
functional groups is proposed with three corresponding interim oxidized
products (epoxy-GO, oxonium-GO, and sulfate-GO).

3. The intrinsic formation and conversion
path is interpreted with the FMO theory. The simulation results also
show that the C–O bond of GO can be protected by the electrostatic
repulsion between the oxonium ion and the oxidizing agent, as well
as the steric hindrance of tetrahedral monosulfate, resulting in the
chemistry stability of the oxidized domains.

4. The density functional theory (DFT)
method is used to calculate the Gibbs free energy of oxidized microdomains,
illustrating that the oxidized domains can capture electrons from
the surrounding graphitic domains and result in the electron deficiency
of the aromatic domains, elucidating the self-regulating feature of
the aromatic islands.



4 Experimental
and Computational Methods
4.1 Materials
Natural
flake graphite
with a uniform size of about 150 μm was purchased from Qingdao
Meizhen Co., Ltd. Potassium permanganate (KMnO4, 99.5%,
AR), sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%, AR), and barium
chloride (BaCl2, 99.5%, AR) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Potassium persulfate (K2S2O8, 99.0%, AR), acetic acid (CH3COOH,
99.5%, AR), ethyl acetate (C4H8O2, 99.0%, AR), periodic acid (H5IO6, 99.0%,
AR), and hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (H2O2, 30.0 wt %, AR) were purchased from Aladdin Chemical Reagents Co.,
Ltd. All chemicals were used as received without further purification.

4.2 Preparation of Oxidized Graphite
A modified
Hummers’ method was used to oxidize graphite.11,47 First, 50 mL of concentrated H2SO4 was added
into a 100 mL conical flask at 20 °C, and 3.0 g KMnO4 was dispersed in the acid with vigorous stirring for 10 min. Then,
the KMnO4–H2SO4 mixture was
heated to 50 °C in a water bath, and 0.5 g of graphite was carefully
added into it as the formed oxidizing agent species is highly reactive
and known to detonate at high temperatures or in contact with organic
compounds.15 The addition time of graphite
was controlled at about 3 min, and vigorous stirring was applied to
form a homogeneous mixture. To reveal the chemical and structural
evolution during the graphite oxidization, the whole oxidation process
was monitored at 9 points with 12 min intervals, namely, 0, 12, 24,
36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 min. The 0 min is the starting point of
oxidization, at which the graphite was just added into the KMnO4–H2SO4 mixture, while the 96
min is the endpoint of oxidization, where the graphite domain completely
disappeared. The nine sampling points were named A0, A1, A2, A3, A4,
A5, A6, A7, and A8, respectively. For each sampling point, the reaction
mixture was poured into 150 mL of concentrated H2SO4 and then aliquoted into six 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes,
followed by repeated centrifugal washing with concentrated H2SO4 at 6000 rpm until the supernatant became clear and
colorless, indicating a complete removal of the oxidizing agent (MnO3+). The centrifuge pellet of A0 was examined with
X-ray diffraction (XRD).

To characterize the chemical composition
of the unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite, each collected pellet (A0–A8)
was first dispersed in K2S2O8–H2SO4 mixture (200 mL, 50 mg/mL) with stirring for
10 min to chemically reduce solid MnO2, followed by 5 min
centrifugation at 6000 rpm. Although the standard electrode potential
of K2S2O8 (+1.96 V for S2O82–/SO42–) is higher than that of MnO2 (+1.69 V for MnO4–/MnO2), in the medium of concentrated
H2SO4, K2S2O8 has to decompose to form H2O2, which then
reduces the solid MnO2 (see a detailed explanation in Supporting Information, Discussion S3). Second,
the pellet was dispersed in concentrated H2SO4 and centrifuged for another 5 min at 6000 rpm to remove K2S2O8 so as to avoid its contact with the washing
solvent in the subsequent step. Third, the pellet was redispersed
in 200 mL of anhydrous acetic acid and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for
5 min repeatedly until the complete removal of H2SO4, K2SO4, and MnSO4 (no precipitate
formed in supernatant in the presence of BaCl2 aqueous
solution and no color change on pellet in the presence of H5IO6 aqueous solution). For an efficient and thorough drying,
the pellet was further redispersed in anhydrous ethyl acetate and
centrifuged (6000 rpm, 5 min) for two times to displace the anhydrous
acetic acid, as the boiling point and saturation vapor pressure of
ethyl acetate are lower than that of acetic acid. Finally, the pellet
was transferred to a vacuum freeze-dryer and maintained at −40
°C until it completely dried. The unhydrolyzed oxidized graphite
powder samples without any impurity ions were thus prepared and used
for SSNMR, XPS, and TGA–differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
analyses.

4.3 Characterization
The crystalline
phase and structure of oxidized graphite were characterized by XRD
using a D8-Advance, Bruker AXS diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation,
λ = 1.5418 Å) in the continuous scan mode over 5–60°
(2θ) with a scan rate of 10° (2θ)/min, operating
at 40 kV and 40 mA. Direct 13C pulse SSNMR (13C SSNMR) spectra were acquired on a Bruker Advance 400D spectrometer
(50.3 MHz 13C, 200.1 MHz 1H). In particular,
the spectra shown in Figures 1d and 2a were acquired with the 4 mm
rotor spinning at 12.0 kHz, 90° 13C pulse, 39.9 ms
FID acquisition time, and 3-relaxation delay for all samples and processed
with 50 Hz (1 ppm) of line broadening. Relatively long relaxation
delays were used to ensure meaningful relative signal intensities.
TGA and DSC were performed on a NETZSCH STA 449F5 thermogravimetric
analyzer. The samples (5 mg) were heated in a N2 atmosphere
from room temperature to 800 °C at 5 °C·min–1. XPS analysis was carried on a PHI-5000 Versaprobe X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer.

4.4 Computation
The
spin density distribution,
molecular orbital spatial distribution, and energy variation of the
reactants and the simulated interim oxidized products were calculated
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with the Gaussian 09 program package.48 The structure of the graphene supercell with n = 19 (n is the number of benzene rings
in the graphene) was used in calculations. The edge of graphene was
terminated with hydrogen atoms. Because the oxygen-containing functional
groups are randomly distributed on the carbon skeleton (LK structural
model), we selected a pair of adjacent carbon atoms on the plane of
the carbon skeleton to generate an oxygen-containing group (epoxy
group), which remained at the fixed position in the subsequent calculations
for the protonation of epoxy and ring-opening of the oxonium ion.
The atomic coordinates of calculated reactants and the simulated interim
oxidized products are provided in Supporting Information (Calculation data S2).
