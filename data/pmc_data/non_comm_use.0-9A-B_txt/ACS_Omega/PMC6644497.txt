An
efficient and concise protocol was developed for the synthesis
of diverse morphan derivatives 5–7 by the Michael and aza-Michael reaction of different types of quinone
monoketals 1 or quinone imine ketals 2 with
enaminones or enamine esters 3 promoted by 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
in acetone at reflux. Notably, when cyclic enaminone 4 was used as a substrate in the aza-Michael and 1,2-addition reactions
with quinone monoketals 1, they gave another novel morphan 8. This method is suitable for parallel synthesis of bridged
ring compounds. As a result, highly diverse morphan derivatives were
easily and efficiently prepared by the Michael/aza-Michael or aza-Michael/1,2-addition
reactions.

==== Body
Introduction
The morphan (2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane)
skeleton widely exists
in biologically active natural and natural-like synthetic products.
For example, strychnine1 and morphine2 (Figure 1) are the best known molecules due to their broad biological
profile. In addition, some synthetic pharmaceuticals or natural-like
biological molecules, such as immune suppressants (FR901483),3 antitumor agents (daphniphyllum alkaloids),4 opioid agonists (compound A),5 and opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., compound B(6) and naloxone), are morphan derivatives.

Figure 1 Structures
of morphans and the targeted compounds.

Available morphan derivatives have been a concern for many
years
due to their broad spectrum of biological activities. Consequently,
in recent years, more and more practical procedures have been developed
for the synthesis of various morphan derivatives by the organic chemists.7−12 These procedures have greatly contributed to synthesis of natural-like
morphan products. However, most of these approaches involve metal
catalysts under strict anhydrous conditions or multistep synthesis.
Accordingly, it is necessary and desirable to develop concise, highly
site-selective cascade reaction to construct a library of molecularly
diverse morphan derivatives.

Quinone monoketals are an important
building block that are widely
used for the synthesis of various structurally diverse natural or
natural-like products.13,14 Quinone monoketals contain two
unsaturated C=C bonds, which are often used as 1,4-nucleophilic
addition acceptors by one of the two C=C bonds for the synthesis
of fused-ring compounds.15,16 Compared with quinone
monoketals, quinone imine ketals17,18 have some
of their own properties, such as having a more active imino group
that is attacked by alkyne or alkyl amino, like the 1,2-addition,
or one of the two C=C bonds as in the Diels–Alder reaction.
However, the two C=C bonds of quinone imine ketals are hardly
used as 1,4-nucleophilic addition acceptors. For many years, only
a few successful examples have been completed.18

Enaminones and enamine esters are interesting and
versatile building
blocks19−24 that are used unparalleled to synthesize various fused heterocycles
by the thousands. However, the enaminones and enamine esters used
as substrates to construct bridged ring compounds are very limited.
To date, incorporation at the two nucleophilic sites (α-C and
N) through the Michael/aza-Michael addition or the aza-Michael/1,2-addition
reaction of enaminones or enamine esters to form bridged ring frame
morphan compounds has been very limited.

For many years, 1,1-enediamines25−35 have been widely used as building blocks. Among them, some morphan
derivatives have been designed and synthesized on the basis of 1,1-enediamines.36,37 However, despite being versatile building blocks, enaminones and
enamine esters have not been widely used in the synthesis of bridged
ring compounds, such as morphan derivatives whose reactivity is usually
lower than that of 1,1-enediamines.

To prepare molecularly diverse
morphan derivatives starting with
the less reactive enaminones and enamine esters substrates and to
further investigate the more active immunosuppressant, we study the
reactions of different types of quinone monoketals 1 or
quinone imine ketals 2 with enaminones or enamine esters 3–4 under special conditions. We obtained
novel target morphan compounds 5–7 by the Michael and aza-Michael reaction of quinone monoketals 1 or quinone imine ketals 2 with enaminones or
enamine esters 3–4 promoted by 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU) in acetone at reflux. Unexpectedly, when the cyclic enaminone 4 was used as a substrate for the reaction with quinone monoketals 1, they produced special morphans 8 by the aza-Michael
reaction and 1,2-addition reaction (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis Routes of Morphans 5–8
Results and Discussion
Initially, to evaluate the Michael
and aza-Michael addition of
quinone monoketals 1 and Enaminones 3, the
mixture (1a/3a = 1.1:1) was treated in acetonitrile
at reflux for 12 h (Table 1, entry 1) and the reaction could not proceed. Then, proton
acids, including AgOTf and Cu(OTf)2, were added into the
mixture (1a/3a = 1.1:1) at reflux for 12
h (Table 1, entries
2–3). The results demonstrated that the reaction could not
proceed at all. Then, K2CO3 was added into the
mixture with the same solvent and refluxed for 12 h (Table 1, entry 4); we luckily obtained
the product with a 33% yield. Thereafter, different solvents, including
acetonitrile, 1,4-dioxane and acetone, were used as solvent and promoted
by the inorganic base Cs2CO3. The results showed
that Cs2CO3 can promote the reaction to some
extent. Then, a stronger alkali t-BuOK was used with
1,4-dioxane at reflux for 12 h. The results indicated that the reaction
becomes more complex and cannot achieve a positive result as the alkali
is too strong (Table 1, entry 7). Then, the organic base DBU was added with different solvents
and the mixture was refluxed for 12 h (Table 1, entries 8–11). Fortunately, we found
that the organic base DBU can largely promote the reaction and produce
the product with excellent yield in acetone (90%). Subsequently, other
organic bases, including Et3N and DABCO, were evaluated
in acetone at reflux for 12 h and showed that DABCO and Et3N also could not produce a positive result (Table 1, entries 12–13). On the basis of
these results, we concluded that DBU is the optimal promoter and acetone
is the best solvent for this cascade reaction (Table 1, entry 10). Finally, the different reaction
time was also investigated (Table 1, entries 14–15). The results revealed that
the optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of morphan derivatives
were acetone as the solvent and DBU as the base under reflux for 12
h with a 90% yield (Table 1, entry 10).

c Bold entry indicates the best condition.

We further explored the scope and
limitations of the cascade reaction
based on the optimal conditions. Therefore, different quinone monoketals 1 and various enaminones 3 were utilized in this
cascade reaction (Table 2, 5a–u). The results showed that
various enaminones are suitable for the reaction to obtain the target
compounds with moderate to good yields. However, the structure of
quinone monoketals 1 has influence on the reaction yield
(Table 2, 5a vs f; 5l vs t). Similarly,
the structure of enaminones 3 also determines the reaction
yield. Usually, the electron-withdrawing (F, Cl) benzoyl group of
enaminones is favorable to the yield (Table 2, 5a vs c; 5q vs r).

To further
explore the scope and limitations of the cascade reaction,
the different enamine esters 3 were used as substrates
to react with quinone monoketals 1 in acetone (Table 3). The results showed
that many kinds of enamine esters are a good substrate and produce
the target compounds with good yields. Among them, on using (E)-3-aminobut-2-enenitrile as a substrate, the reaction
can generate the products with excellent yields (Table 3, 6d vs b). On the basis of the reaction of the different quinone monoketals 1 with diverse enaminones and enamine esters 3, the quinone imine ketal 2 were used in this reaction
and the scope and limitations of the cascade reaction were evaluated
(Table 4). The results
showed that the cascade reaction can smoothly proceed under the same
conditions and produce the target compounds with good yields. Remarkably,
we only obtain one of the isomers of 7a–e (Table 4).

b Isolated yield based

To achieve
the molecular diversity of the products, cyclic enaminone 4 was used as a substrate in reactions with quinone monoketals 1a–b. Surprisingly, we obtained another
kind of morphan derivatives 8a–b with
moderate yields (63–66%). The reaction was via the aza-Michael
reaction and 1,2-addition reaction. First, the amino group of the
enaminones binds to one of the C=C bonds of the quinone monoketals 1 through the aza-Michael reaction. Second, the α-C
of the enaminones attack the carbonyl of compounds 1 via
1,2-addition to form the target compounds (Table 5, 8a–b).
Since the amino group of 4 is more active than that of
α-C in the cyclic enaminone 4, it leads to different
products via different reactions.

To confirm
the structure of the morphan derivatives, compounds 5n, 6e, 7b, and 8a were
selected as the representative compounds and each was characterized
by X-ray crystallography, as shown in Figure 2 (5n: CCDC 1817955; 6e: CCDC 1817956) and Figure 3 (7b: CCDC 1818163; 8a: CCDC 1818117).

A proposed mechanism of how DBU
promoted the Michael and aza-Michael
addition reactions is presented in Scheme 2. Initially, the quinone imine ketals 2 react with the enaminones 3 via Michael addition
to obtain the intermediate 9. Then, intermediate compounds 9 are inverted to give intermediates 10 through
imine-enamine tautomerization. Finally, intermediates 10 underwent intramolecular aza-Michael addition to form the target
compounds 7.

Scheme 2 Mechanism Hypotheses of the Cascade Reaction
Conclusions
In
conclusion, we developed a procedure for concise synthesis of
potentially biologically active morphan derivatives through the Michael
and aza-Michael addition or aza-Michael and 1,2-addition reactions.
Accordingly, a molecularly diverse morphan library was rapidly constructed
in one-pot with good yields by simply refluxing a reaction mixture
of quinone monoketals 1 or quinone imine ketals 2 and enaminones or enamine esters 3–4 in acetone and promoted by DBU.

Experimental Section
General
Methods
All compounds were fully characterized
by spectroscopic data analysis. The NMR spectra were recorded on a
Bruker DRX500 or DRX600 NMR spectrophotometer (Bruker Biospin GmbH,
Ettlingen, Germany); chemical shifts (δ) are expressed in ppm, J values are given in Hz, and deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-d6 or CDCl3 was used
as solvent. The IR spectra were recorded on a Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) Avatar 360 spectrophotometer (Thermo Nicolet Corp., Madison
WI) using the KBr pellet technique. The reactions were monitored by
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel GF254 (EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA). The melting points were determined on an
XT-4A melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. High-resolution
mass spectra time-of-flight (HRMS-TOF) were performed on an AutoSpec
Premier P776 mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., Milford,. MA). X-ray
diffraction analysis was performed using an Apex Duo diffractometer
(Bruker AXS GmbH., Karlsruhe, Germany). All chemicals and solvents
were used as received without further purification unless otherwise
stated. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (200–300
mesh).

The materials were purchased from Adamas-β Ltd.
(Shanghai China). Compounds 1 were prepared according
to the literature.17 Compounds 2 were prepared according to the literature.38

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 5–6
The quinone monoketals 1 (1.1 mmol),
enaminones or enamine esters 3 (1.0 mmol),
and acetone (15 mL) were charged into a 25 mL round-bottomed flask.
Then, DBU (2.0 mmol) was added into the mixture. The mixture was held
at reflux for about 12 h and monitored by TLC until the enaminones
or enamine esters 3 substrates were completely consumed.
After the reaction was completed, the reaction system was cooled to
room temperature. The reaction mixture was then poured into 25 mL
of water and 50 mL of ethyl acetate for extraction and separation.
Subsequently, the crude product was concentrated by distillation under
reduced pressure and then purified by column chromatography (petroleum
ether/ethyl acetate = 1: 2) and a series of compounds 5–6 were obtained with a 61–96% yield.
The products were further identified by NMR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy,
and HRMS analysis.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 7
The quinone monoketals 1 (1.1 mmol),
enamine
esters 3 (1.0 mmol), and acetone (15 mL) were charged
into a 25 mL round-bottomed flask. Then DBU (2.0 mmol) was added into
the mixture. The mixture was at reflux for about 12 h. After the reaction
was completed, the reaction system was cooled to room temperature.
The reaction mixture was poured into 25 mL of water and 50 mL of ethyl
acetate for extraction and separation. Then, the crude product was
concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure, which was purified
by column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 1: 2) and
a series of compounds 7 with 87–92% yields was
obtained.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of Compounds 8
The quinone monoketals 1 (1.1 mmol), enaminones 4 (1.0 mmol), and acetone
(15 mL) were charged into a 25 mL
round-bottomed flask. Then, DBU (2.0 mmol) was added into the mixture.
The mixture was at reflux for about 12 h. After the reaction was completed,
the reaction system was cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture
was poured into 25 mL of water and 50 mL of ethyl acetate for extraction
and separation. Then, the crude product was concentrated by distillation
under reduced pressure, which was purified by column chromatography
(petroleum ether/ethyl acetate = 1: 2) and a series of compounds 8 with 63–66% yields were obtained.
