Many
methods have been used to detect heavy metals in herbal medicines,
while few are developed to remove them. In this study, a novel genetically
engineered fusion protein composed of metallothionein (MT), cellulose
binding module (CBM), and superfolder GFP (sfGFP) was designed to
remove heavy metals. MT, a kind of cysteine-rich protein, was used
to chelate heavy metals with high specific affinity. The CBM facilitated
the fusion protein MT-CBM-sfGFP binding to cellulose specifically,
which made the purification and immobilization in one step. The sfGFP
was used to detect the fusion protein MT-CBM-sfGFP easily during the
process of expression and immobilization. The MT from Cancer pagurus (MTCap) and the CBM from Cellulomonas fimi (CBMCef) were used as
an example and the fusion protein (MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Then, the cell lysates were mechanically mixed with cellulose to
create biosorbent MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose.
The efficiency of the biosorbent MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose for Pb2+ removal was evaluated using
the water decoction of Honeysuckle as a model. Results suggested that
MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose had high efficiency
for Pb2+ removal from the water decoction of Honeysuckle
without affecting its active ingredients. The low-cost, easy production,
and high efficiency of the biosorbent enable it to have many applications
in heavy metal removal from aqueous solutions of herbal medicines
and food.

Introduction
Traditional Chinese
Medicine is widely used for treatment and health
care throughout the world. However, it has been reported in many countries
that some poisoning cases were associated with the presence of toxic
heavy metals in medicinal plants.1−4 The main source of heavy metal contamination
is always from the polluted air, water, and soil.5 Heavy metals may cause renal failure, symptoms of chronic
toxicity, liver damage, and other health hazards.6−10 As a serious threat to human health, Chinese herb
medicine with heavy metal contamination would lead to an enormous
waste of resources and impaired economic benefits.

During past
decades, much effort has been devoted to sensing,11−13 targeting,14−16 and removing17−19 heavy metals. Metallothioneins
(MTs) are paid much attention in heavy metal removal attributing to
their cysteine-rich molecular structures and thus the strong metal-binding
affinity.20−24 Heterologous expression of MTs with a high yield in bacterial cells
is regarded as a promising method of biosorption against heavy metals.15,25−27 Free bacteria involving cell surface display techniques
are always applied to improve the adsorption efficiency of MTs against
heavy metals. Nevertheless, the biggest shortcoming of using free
bacteria to treat heavy metal contamination is the difficulty to separate
them from the environment.28 Moreover,
free bacteria immobilized to the matrix via whole cell immobilization
technique can simplify the separation process.29 In addition, MTs being conjugated to bacterial cellulose
through covalent interactions was also developed to enhance the metal-binding
capacity of purified MT.14 Unfortunately,
most active studies have been mainly focused on targeting and removal
of heavy metals in waste water but not in polluted Chinese herb medicine.
The main reason is that bacteria are restricted for use in drugs.

Cellulose binding modules (CBMs) are a class of protein modules
which present a specific cellulose-binding activity.30,31 A reversible or irreversible attachment to the cellulose can be
achieved with CBM from different families. For example, family I and
IV CBMs bind reversibly to the cellulose while family II and III CBMs
usually are irreversibly bound. These CBMs binding irreversibly to
the cellulose can be used for applications involving immobilization.32 Moreover, cellulose is safe for use in food
or pharmaceutical applications, which is an inexpensive, chemically
inert material.

In the present study, the MT from cancer pagurus (MTCap) was expressed as
a fusion protein with the CBM
from Cellulomonas fimi (CBMCef) and superfolder GFP (sfGFP). The CBMCef in the fusion
protein can bind to cellulose specifically and make the fusion protein
be purified and immobilized in one-step. sfGFP in the fusion protein
not only can improve the expression of MTCap but also make
the process of expression and immobilization easier to check by taking
advantage of its visible fluorescence under daylight. By mechanically
immobilizing MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP with cellulose,
a highly efficient biosorbent was created. The efficiency of Pb2+ due to the biosorbent was evaluated using the water decoction
of Honeysuckle as a model (Scheme 1).

Results and Discussion
Fusion Protein MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP Expression
and Binding to Cellulose
MTs, a class of low molecular mass
and cysteine-rich proteins, are widely distributed in, particularly,
the eukaryote.33 The MT from C. pagurus was chosen in this study because of its
high affinity to Cd, Hg, and Cu.34,35 The low molecular
mass of MTs makes the purification a hard process.36 Thus the fusion of MT with other protein tags such as GST
or MBP simplifies the purification.37,38 In addition,
CBMs that bind irreversibly to the cellulose are widely used for enzyme
purification and immobilization. In this study, a family 2 CBM from
the endoglucanase A of C. fimi was
chosen to bind crystalline cellulose tightly which was widely used
for enzyme immobilization.39,40 Meanwhile, sfGFP was
used to make the process of expression and immobilization be easily
checked attributing to its green fluorescence under daylight. The
modules of MTCap, CBMCef, and sfGFP were connected
by two flexible linkers to make their functions not be influenced
by each other (Figure 1A). The gene that encodes the fusion protein MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP was cloned into the expression vector pET28a and
then transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). After being induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside
(IPTG) for 12 h, the cell turned green when compared to that of uninduced
(Figure 1B), which
suggested that the fusion protein has been expressed successfully.
In other words, it is very convenient to check whether the recombinant
fusion protein is expressed based on the green fluorescence. Then,
the cells were collected and lysed with sonication. The microcrystalline
cellulose mixed with the cell lysated turned green while those as
the control became white (Figure 1C). These results suggested that the fusion protein
MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP binds to the microcrystalline
quickly and tightly by using the CBMCef.

Adsorption Capacity of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@Cellulose
against Pb2+
Water insoluble microcrystalline
cellulose not only contributes to fast purification of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP but also easy separation of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose from the liquid environment. It
has been reported that natural and modified microcrystalline cellulose
show the ability of adsorption against heavy metal ions.41,42 Thus, the adsorption capacity of the microcrystalline cellulose
used in this study against heavy metals was evaluated. Almost all
the Cd2+ (16.3 ng/mL) and Hg2+ (18.0 ng/mL)
were adsorbed by 0.05 g/mL of cellulose. However, the adsorption of
Pb2+ by cellulose was not obvious even at a concentration
of 1 g/mL (Figure 2). It indicated that Pb2+ was barely adsorbed by the microcrystalline
cellulose.

Figure 2 Effect of cellulose with different concentrations on lead ions.

Because of strong affinity of microcrystalline
cellulose against
Cd2+ and Hg2+ but not Pb2+, the adsorption
affinity of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose against
Pb2+ was further investigated. A sharp decrease in absorbance
was observed obviously. As the concentration of lead ions was determined
against the linearity curve plotted against the standard, it was found
that the concentration of free lead ions fell from 15.05 to 0.39 ng/mL
which was shown in Figure 3 (black part). It meant that 97.4% lead ions were chelated
by MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose. The result
revealed that MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose was
the highly efficient biosorbent for Pb2+ removal.

and Honeysuckle water decoction (red).

Numerous reports had shown that MTs were the well-characterized
proteins for heavy metal binding. However, there is little application
of MT involved in the removal of heavy metals in Chinese herb medicine.
Guo et al. studied and analyzed the papers about heavy metals in Chinese
medical materials published in 2000–2016.5 They found that Honeysuckle was the only one in which its
contents of arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury exceed the limits,
especially for lead. In addition, decoction with water is the most
widely used form of Chinese herb medicine. In the boiling process,
most of active ingredients were extracted into the water solution.
In addition, protein denaturation would lead to some of heavy metals
being dissociated into the water solution too. That is to say, it
is necessary to investigate the binding ability of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose against Pb2+ in Honeysuckle
water decoction. The water decoction obtained was treated with a 0.5
g/mL MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose suspension
and subjected into atomic absorption spectrometer (AAS). A decrease
of the concentration of Pb2+ from 3.637 to 1.111 ng/mL
is seen in Figure 3 (red part), which meant that 69.5% lead in Honeysuckle water decoction
was chelated by MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose.
The efficiency of lead removal in Honeysuckle decoction was lower
when compared with the lead nitrate solution. The reason for it might
be that lead in the Honeysuckle water decoction determined by AAS
was the total concentration of lead. However, divalent lead ions would
be adsorbed by MTCap in MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose. That is to say, some nonfree lead was still left
in the supernatant after being treated with MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose.

Effect of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@Cellulose
on Active Ingredients in Honeysuckle Water Decoction
Honeysuckle,
the dry flower bud or early blossoms of Lonicera japonica Thunb, possessing the effects of antisepsis and anti-inflammation,
clearing heat antitoxicant, is the raw material of medicine, health
products, cosmetics, and food. It is stipulated in Chinese Pharmacopoeia
that chlorogenic acid is one of the most important quality indicators
of Honeysuckle. Thus, the effect of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose on the chlorogenic acid in Honeysuckle water decoction
was investigated by HPLC. As shown in Figure 4 , the retention time of chlorogenic acid
in the reference solution was 13.05 ± 0.05 min (blue). Moreover,
the ones in the water decoctions after treatment with water (black),
cellulose (red), and MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose
(brown) were 13.09, 13.07, and 13.06 min separately. Besides, the
peak areas in three water decoctions were 72.46, 72.17, and 72.14
mAu·min, respectively. Moreover, the retention time and peak
area for other peaks were almost consistent. These results illustrated
that MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose had no effect
on the chlorogenic acid and other ingredients in the Honeysuckle water
decoction. In addition to Honeysuckle, there are many Chinese herb
medicine which also might be contaminated by heavy metals, such as
Radix Pseudostellariae, Glycyrrhiza Uralensis, Astragalus Membranaceus,
and so on. This method based on MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose was also used for the Pb2+ removal from
their water decoctions.

Conclusions
In this study, a novel biosorbent MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose for heavy metal removal was designed
and prepared.
The advantages of CBMCef and sfGFP were combined to make
the production of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose
visual, quick, and cheap. CBMCef facilitated the fusion
protein bind to cellulose rapidly and specificity, which makes the
MTCap purification and immobilization in one-step. The
sfGFP, whose fluorescence can be seen under daylight, made it easier
to check whether MTCap is expressed in the host and bonded
to the cellulose. By mechanically mixing MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP with cellulose, we created a highly efficient biosorbent
for Pb2+ removal from the water decoction of Honeysuckle.
In addition, the MTCap could be replaced with other sources
to form new fusion proteins with high affinity to other heavy metal
ions. The biosorbent can be used as an effective, renewable, and environmentally
friendly method for heavy metal removal from decoctions of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, Liquid Drugs, and Food.

Plasmid Construction and Fusion Protein Expression
The nucleotide sequence of family 2 CBM was obtained from the endoglucanase
A of C. fimi (GenBank accession no. M15823.1). The
nucleotide sequence of MT was from C. pagurus (GenBank accession no. AM743087.1). The nucleotide sequence of
sfGFP was obtained from the plasmid pG1AK-sfGFP. The schematic representation
of the fusion protein is illustrated in Figure 1A. The domains of MTCap, CBMCef, and sfGFP were connected by the linker of GSGGAGGS and
GGGSPTGG to form the fusion protein MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP. The nucleotide sequence of the fusion protein (see Supporting Information) was synthesized by Genscript
(Nanjing, China). The full length gene of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP was amplified by PCR using the expression primers
P-F: 5′-CTACCATGGATGCCGGACCCGTGCTGCAAG-3′ and P-R: 5′-CTCGAATTCTCATTTGTACAGTTCATCCATACCATGCGTG-3′.
The PCR product was digested with restriction endonucleases NcoIand EcoRIand cloned into pET-28a (+).The
recombinant plasmid, pET-MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP,
was verified by sequencing using the common sequencing primers T7
pro and T7 ter and then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells. The transformant harboring the recombinant
plasmid (pET-MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP) was grown in
LB medium containing 100 μg mL–1 of Kanamycin
at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by
the addition of IPTG at a final concentration of 0.5 mM at 30 °C
for 12 h.

Binding of the Fusion Protein MT-CBM-sfGFP to Cellulose
The cells were harvested by centrifugation (12,000g, 4 °C for 5 min) from 100 mL cultures and resuspended with
10 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5). The cells were lysed by
sonication (6 s, 200 W) on ice and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was transferred to
another tube containing 1 g of microcrystalline cellulose. After 1
h of gentle agitation at room temperature, MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose complexes were recovered through centrifugation
at 10,000g for 2 min and rinsed with deionized water.

Adsorption Capacity of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@Cellulose
against Toxic Heavy Metals Using AAS
MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose was tested for absorbing heavy metals such
as cadmium, lead, and mercury. Three solutions, including MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose suspension, cellulose suspension,
and water, were mixed with different heavy metal samples (Pb(NO3)2, CdCl2, and HgCl2) in
equal volume, respectively, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature
with a mild agitation of 200 rpm. The concentrations of Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+ in heavy metal samples were
56.3, 16.3, and 18.0 ng/mL, separately. Next, the cellulose and MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose were removed by centrifuge.
In addition, the supernatant was treated with 4% nitric acid in equal
volume to obtain the samples. Then, these samples were subjected to
AAS for estimating the concentrations of Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+, which was determined against the linearity
curve plotted against the standard. The amount of lead or cadmium
was measured by the graphite furnace atomic absorption method. The
amount of mercury was measured by the cold vapor generation absorption
method. The operation condition for lead was as follows: drying temperature
at 100 °C for 20 s; charring at 700 °C for 20 s; atomization
at 2000 °C for 5 s; and the determined wavelength was 283.3 nm.
The operation condition for cadmium was as follows: drying at 120 °C
for 20 s; charring at 500 °C for 20 s; atomization at 1900 °C
for 5 s; and the determined wavelength was 228.8 nm. The operation
condition for mercury was as follows: 0.5% sodium borohydride and
0.1% sodium hydroxide (both fresh prepared) were used as the reductant
in the hydride generator (LH-2A, General Research Institute for Nonferrous
Metals, Beijing, China). Hydrochloric acid and nitrogen (0.36%) were
used as the carrier liquid and gas, respectively. The determined wavelength
was 253.6 nm.

MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose
was also tested for adsorption of Pb2+ in the water decoction
of Honeysuckle. The dry Honeysuckle was immersed for 4 h with 10-fold
water, boiling refluxed for 1 h, cooled to room temperature, and filtered
with gauze to obtain water decoction. Then, the water decoction was
centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min. The supernatant
was treated with 4% nitric acid in equal volume and subjected to AAS
for estimating the concentration of Pb2+.

Effect of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@Cellulose
on the Active Ingredients of Water Decoction of Honeysuckle by HPLC
Cellulose and MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose
were mixed with the water decoction of Honeysuckle, respectively,
with water as a control. After a mild agitation of 200 rpm for 1 h
at room temperature, three solutions were centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 min. Then, the supernatants were filtered with
a 0.22 μm filter membrane and sent for HPLC analysis. The reference
solution and the samples were subjected to HPLC (DIONEX, ultimate
3000) to estimate the effect of MTCap-CBMCef-sfGFP@cellulose on the active ingredients of Honeysuckle. The standard
substance of chlorogenic acid was resolved in water to prepare the
reference solution (1 mg/mL). The chromatographic conditions were
as follows: hypersil ODS2 C18 column (Elite, 250 mm ×
4.6 mm, 5 μm) with a temperature of 30 °C, acetonitrile–0.1%
phosphoric acid solution as the mobile phase with a gradient elution,
and 0.5 mL/min flow rate with a detection wavelength of 327 nm.
