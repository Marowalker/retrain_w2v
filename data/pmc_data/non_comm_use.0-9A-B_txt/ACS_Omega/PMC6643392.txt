Different compositions of trimetallic
alloy containing silver,
copper, and nickel (AgxCuyNiz) were electrodecorated
in a protic ionic liquid medium on glassy carbon electrodes in order
to investigate the suitability of the materials as catalysts for electrochemical
reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2). Surface characteristic
morphology obtained by scanning electron microscopy shows cauliflower
crystallites for the deposit of Ag, whereas materials of Cu and Ni
exhibit cubic grains and fine particles, respectively. Deposits of
trimetallic alloy containing Ag, Cu, and Ni exhibit the mixture of
the three characteristic features. Further, trimetallic alloy containing
a large amount of Ag provides high crystallinity, whereas predominance
of Cu as well as Ni results in porous structures, as revealed by X-ray
diffraction analysis. Atomic absorption spectroscopy () was used to
determine the compositions of different alloy materials. The suitability
of nanomaterials as cathodes for electroreduction of benzyl bromide
in CO2 containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium
tetrafluoroborate (DMF/TBABF4)/N,N-dimethylformamide medium was explored. The linear sweep
voltammogram reveals that Ag46Cu40Ni14 shows higher cathodic peak current and lower cathodic peak potential
than those of other deposited nanomaterials as well as alloys, indicating
its higher catalytic activity for such an electroreduction process,
whereas potentiostatic electrolysis confirms the abovementioned results.

Introduction
Alloy nanomaterials
containing silver (Ag)/copper (Cu)/nickel (Ni)
have received considerable interest in recent years in the areas of
catalysis, optics, and energy storage owing to the synergetic combination
of atomic components at the surface, mainly triggered by electronic
tuning of metals.1 These materials can
induce changes in the kinetics of organic transformations involving
multistep processes by variations on the electrophilicity/nucleophilicity
of the metal center.2 They differ from
their corresponding monometallic structures in terms of composition
and structural morphology, exhibiting distinctive physicochemical
properties, wide diversity in reactivity, and enhanced electron transfer
at the electrode surface.3 For example,
bimetallic alloys based on Ni–Cu find a number of applications
in the field corrosion science4 electroanalytical
chemistry,5−7 hydrogen generation,8,9 and catalysis.10

On account of limited reserves and costly
nature of Ag, alternate
strategies must be thought of for increasing its utilization efficiency
and decreasing its usage. One such way is to alloy Ag with other metals,
which can reduce its cost and increase the catalytic performance.
For example, Ag-based bimetallic alloys find attraction because of
their wide range of applications in the field of optics,11 sensors,11−14 and electrocatalysts.15−18 Nevertheless, instead of bimetallic
alloys, trimetallic materials are still very cheap, where the amount
of Ag can still be lowered and the composition and morphology of the
latter can be tuned, resulting in enhanced catalysis.19,20 Searching the literature data, only one paper deals with the trimetallic
system based on Ni, Cu, and Ag alloy as catalysts for the hydrogenation
of nitrophenol.21

In recent years,
much effort has been made to develop effective
processes for the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) in
to useful products. Though different routes such as electro, thermal,
and photocatalytic under solar radiation exist for CO2 conversion,
electrochemical fixation of the former into an organic moiety is considered
as one of most useful and green method.22 In particular, carboxylic acid containing the hydroxyl group, a
translational product in many natural and medicinally important compounds,
can be synthesized effectively by this process without the involvement
on the conversion of toxic cyanides into acids by hydrolysis.23,24 Several Ni and palladium complexes had been used for such processes;25,26 however, the presence of additive catalysts complicate the separation
processes and are not recyclable. In addition, it is also expensive
and not eco-friendly to the environment. In the past years, a series
of studies involving the employment of various metals such as Cu,27 Ni,27,28 and Ag29,30 have been explored for such an electrochemical process. Even electrodeposited
nanomaterials such as Ag,31 Ag–Cu,18 and Ni–Cu10 have been successfully employed for the electrochemical fixation
of CO2, and there is no report on use of the Ag–Cu–Ni
alloy-based electrode as the catalyst for this process.

In general,
Ag–Cu–Ni alloy nanomaterial was prepared
by impregnating these metals in alumina followed by chemical reduction
of hydrazine hydrate in alkali medium.21 Compared to this chemical process, electrochemical deposition is
considered as an efficient method for the fabrication of deposits,
where the shape and size of the nanomaterials may be tuned by current
or applied voltage. Such controlled procedures would result in nanostructures
with enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Further the electrolyte
bath includes hydrazine hydrate in alkaline medium, which are not
eco friendly good, causing generation of effluents and they may face
problem for their disposal. As an alternate to such toxic baths, protic
ionic liquids (PILs) are found to be suitable electrolytes for the
electrodeposition of alloys, as they exhibit advantages such as wide
potential window, good conductivity, environmentally benign nature,
and ease of their preparation over the other solvents.10,32−34

Herein, for the first time, we report the electrochemical
synthesis
of AgxCuyNiz trimetallic alloy material in a PIL, namely,
triethylmethylammonium trifluroacetate (TEATFA), as a green electrolyte
along with nanomaterials such as Ag100, Cu100, and Ni100. The electrochemical behavior of Ag(I), Ni(II),
and Cu(II) ions at different compositions in this medium on glassy
carbon (GC) electrode is investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV),
and the surface morphology of electrodeposits is characterized by
various analytical techniques. The influence of altering the compositions
of alloy material, namely, AgxCuyNiz on the electrochemical
fixation of CO2 into an organic moiety, namely, benzyl
bromide in the nonaqueous electrolyte is analyzed in detail, and the
results are compared with Ag100, Cu100, and
Ni100 along with their corresponding metal electrodes.
The proposed electrochemical reaction is given in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Results and Discussion
Electrodeposition
of Metal Ions
Cyclic voltammograms
of the GC electrode in TEATFA containing 100 mM of Ag(CH3COO), Cu(CH3COO)2, Ni(CH3COO)2 at a sweep rate of 50 mV s–1 are shown
in Figure 1A, and the
inset shows the background voltammogram obtained in the absence of
metal ions. The GC electrode in TEATFA exhibits cathodic and anodic
limits of −1.57 and 1.00 V at a current density of 0.5 mA cm–2 and a total potential window of 2.57 V. The cyclic
voltammogram of the GC electrode in TEATFA having 100 mM of Ag(I)
ions shows a reduction peak at −0.27 V in the forward sweep
followed by a stripping peak at 0.24 V versus Fc in the reverse direction,
associated with reduction of Ag(I) to Ag(0) and oxidation of Ag respectively
(curve a). Voltammogram observed for 100 mM of Cu(II) ionic species
on the GC in the same electrolyte shows two cathodic peaks at −0.52
and −1.18 V [deposition of Cu(II) to Cu(0) via Cu(I)] followed
by two anodic peaks at −0.27 and −1.10 V [stripping
of Cu to Cu(II) via Cu(I)] (curve b). The cyclic voltammogram of 100
mM of Ni(II) ions in TEATFA reveals that the reduction occurs along
with the hydrogen evolution region of TEATFA, followed by a stripping
peak at 0.9 V (curve c), where the onset cathodic potential is at
−1.60 V at a current density of 1.00 mA cm–2. Further electrochemical studies associated with diffusion coefficient
calculations and the plot of peak current versus square root of scan
rate for Ag(I), Cu(II) and Ni(II) ions in the same medium have been
already discussed in our previous research works.18,35

Figure 1 (A)
Cyclic voltammograms recorded in TEATFA on the GC containing
100 mM of Ag(I), Cu(II), and Ni(II) ions at a scan rate of 50 mV s–1 (inset shows the back ground current). (B–D)
Cyclic voltammograms recorded for various compositions of Ag(I), Cu(II),
and Ni(II) ions in TEATFA medium at 50 mV s–1.

Cyclic voltammograms of the GC
electrode in TEATFA containing various
concentrations of Ag(I), Cu(II), and Ni(II) ions (mentioned inside
the figure) at the same sweep rate of 50 mV s–1 are
shown in Figure 1B–D,
respectively. Voltammogram taken with Ag(I), Cu(II), and Ni(II) ions
at a molar ratio of 34:33:33 shows two cathodic peaks at −1.10
and −0.24 V assigned to reduction of Cu(II) ions to Cu and
Ag(I) ions to Ag followed by three oxidation peaks at −0.20,
0.39, and 0.98 V corresponding to oxidation of Ag to Ag(I) ions, Cu
to Cu(II) ions, and Ni to Ni(II) ions, respectively (curve d). The
deposition potentials of these ionic species and stripping potentials
of metals shift toward anodic direction (curve d). With further enhancement
of Ag(I) ion concentrations (from 34 to 50 and 66 mM) in TEATEF by
keeping the total concentration of three ionic species as 100%, the
reduction as well as oxidation peak currents for Ag increases, where
deposition as well as stripping peak currents for Cu(II) and Ni(II)
ions lowers because of decrease in the concentration of both these
species [curves (e & f)].

On the other hand, by enhancing
the concentration of Cu(II) ions
from 33 to 50 and 66 mM, a similar voltammetric pattern appears, where
the stripping and deposition current noted for Cu increases considerably
with a slight shift in the anodic peak potential, [Figure 1C, curves (g and h)], whereas
a decrease in deposition and stripping current of Ag(I) and Ni(II)
is noted, as a result of lowering the concentration of these ionic
species. The trend is observed to be identical for the addition of
Ni(II) ions, where the increase of concentration of Ni(II) ions results
with corresponding increase in deposition and stripping current, and
related lower reduction and oxidation current are noted for Ag(I)
and Cu(II) ions (Figure 1D, curves i and j). It is important to mention here that both the
deposition and stripping currents either enhance or lower with corresponding
increase or decrease in the concentration of the respective ionic
species in the alloy, whereas there is a shift in the deposition peak
potential toward anodic side with the addition of each ionic species
resulting in favorable conditions for the formation of alloy. Further,
as seen in the introduction, efficient co-deposition of Ag, Cu, and
Ni is carried out successfully in the absence of any toxic and corrosive
materials such as hydrazine hydrate and sodium hydroxide. The electrochemical
reaction on the formation of AgxCuyNiz alloy nanodeposits
is given in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Surface Morphological Characteristics
Electrodeposition
of 100 mM of Ag(I), Cu(II), and Ni(II) ions was carried out by keeping
electrolysis potential at −0.70, −1.37, and −1.65
V, respectively, and AgxCuyNix alloy materials for
various compositions of Ag(I), Cu(II), and Ni(II) (mentioned in the
figure caption) on the GC were done by potentiostatic deposition at
−1.5 V for a one and half hour duration in TEATFA medium. The
deposits were cleaned with triple distilled water in order to remove
the ionic liquid from the surface of the electrode and dried in a
vacuum desiccator for 2 h. The potential which provides maximum stripping
current in the voltammogram was preferred as the deposition potential
of Ag100/Cu100/Ni100 and its trimetallic
alloys. Morphological characteristics of the Ag deposits obtained
by scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveal uniform distribution
of numerous nanoballs throughout the surface (Figure 2A). High magnification shows few nanoballs
(down figure of Figure 2A). Cubic grains of Cu deposits are noted at both low and high magnifications
(Figure 2B), whereas
deposits of Ni clearly expose a number of small particles in the dark
background (Figure 2C). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) analysis confirms
the formation of pure deposits for Cu, Ag, and Ni from their respective
ionic species (Figure 3).

Figure 2 SEM images of deposits obtained on GC by potentiostatic polarization
for one and half hours in TEATFA containing 100 mM of (A) Ag(I), (B)
Cu(II), and (C) Ni(II) ions. The potential used for the deposition
of Ag(I), Cu(II), and Ni(II) ions are at −0.70, −1.37,
and −1.65 V, respectively. The magnification of A, B, and C
were taken at 5 and 20 K.

Figure 3 EDAX images of deposits obtained on the GC by potentiostatic polarization
for one and half hours in TEATFA containing 100 mM of (A) Ag(I), (B)
Cu(II), and (C) Ni(II) ions. The potential used for the deposition
of Ag is −0.70 V, Cu −1.37 V, and Ni −1.65 V.
The magnification of A, B, and C were taken at 5 and 20 K.

The SEM picture of AgxCuyNiz alloy
obtained from
the PIL medium containing 34 mM of Ag(I), 33 mM of Cu(II), and 33
mM of Ni(II) ions (total concentration was maintained at 100 mM) shows
deposits of nanoballs along with cubic grains (Figure 4A). When the concentration of Ag(I) ions
is increased to 50 and 66 mM in the mixture, the number of nanoballs
gets multiplied (Figure 4B,C). Dense cubic grains distributed nonuniformly throughout the
surface along with nanoballs are also noted with the addition of 50
mM of Cu(II) ions by keeping 25 mM of Ag(I) and 25 mM of Ni(II) ions
in the mixture (Figure S1A). There is no
significant change in the morphology with further increase in concentration
of Cu(II) ions (Figure S1B). The SEM pictures
of deposits, obtained from the mixture containing 50 mM of Ni(II)
ions along with Ag(I) and Cu(II) show a number of fine particles (Figure S1C), where spongy structures are seen
in high magnification (down figure of (Figure S1C). More number of sponges along with cubic grains and nanoballs
are noted with the addition of 66 mM of Ni(II) ions (Figure S1D). The EDAX analysis confirms the presence of Ag,
Cu, and Ni in the alloy deposits for various compositions (Figures S2 & S3), and the loading of Ag,
Cu, and Ni in the alloy nanomaterials, was determined by atomic absorption
spectroscopy (AAS) analysis.

Figure 4 SEM images of deposits obtained on the GC by
potentiostatic polarization,
for one and half hours in TEATFA containing various concentrations
of Ag(I):Cu(II):Ni(II) ions [mM] (A) 34 + 33 + 33, (B) 50 + 25 + 25,
and (C) 66 + 17 + 17. The potential used for the deposition of alloys
is at −1.53 V. The magnification of A, B, and C was taken at
5 and 20 K.

The percentage compositions
calculated from AAS analysis were changed
into weight percentages with respect to Ag, Cu, and Ni compositions
and are shown in Table 1 as AgxCuyNiz. From the table, it is interesting
to note that in the presence of moderate or high concentrations of
Ag (entries 5 to 10), percentages of Cu and Ni in the alloy are not
consistent with their respective molarities taken for deposition.
This may be due to the fact that the rate of deposition of Ag(I) is
very high when compared to others, leading to its high weight percentage
in the alloy. In particular, when compared to Cu and Ag, Ni shows
very poor deposition rate resulting in low weight percentage, despite
its high concentration (entries 9 and 10). A similar result was obtained
in our previous study on the electrodeposition of Ni–Cu bimetallic
alloy in TEATFA medium, where the amount of Cu and Ni present in the
alloy was found to be inconsistent with the quantity of metal ions
taken in the electrolyte for deposition.35 As a result, Cu showed a higher rate of deposition than that of
Ni. Another reason for the poor deposition of Ni may be associated
with simultaneous cathodic reduction of Ni(II) ions taking place along
with the gas evolution region of the electrolyte.

Figures 5 and 6 show the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) pattern of Ag100, Cu100, and
Ni100 and AgxCuyNiz deposits. Major crystalline
peaks appear at 38.33°, 44.50°,
65.1° 77.95°, and 82.11° (indexed with JCPDS file),
as determined using XRD, which can be assigned to the diffraction
from (111), (200), (220), (311), and (331) planes, respectively, on
the FCC lattice of Ag(0) (Figure 5A). Further, three characteristic diffraction peaks
indexed as (111), (200), and (220) belonging to 2θ values of
44.96, 50.28, and 79.09 as well as 43.88, 51.28, and 76.96, respectively,
are noted for Cu and Ni deposits (Figure 5B,C). These peaks confirm the porous nature
of the deposits.

GC.

XRD patterns for AgxCuyNiz are shown in Figure 6. All the characteristic
peaks observed for Ag100, Cu100, and Ni100 corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes
are present in the XRD pattern. Further, it can be observed from Figure 6A–G that the
enhanced amount of Ag in the alloy (Figure 6G) results in the increase of crystallinity
of the materials, whereas the increase of either Cu or Ni content
leads to its amorphous nature (Figure 6). Moreover, the addition of Ag in the alloy material
increases its peak intensity, and for others, it decreases. This may
be associated with the higher crystal growth rate of Ag at the co-deposited
Cu–Ni, resulting in the considerable changes in the structural
morphologies in AgxCuyNiz samples. It is important to
note that peak positions of Ag, Cu, and Ni do not show any considerable
shift in the lattice parameters because the deposition under constant
potential conditions dominates the control of the structure; however,
it does not show any role in managing the composition of the alloy.

Electrocarboxylation of Benzyl Bromide
Voltammograms
taken for the benzyl bromide in the presence and absence of CO2 on the three metal electrodes, pure nanomaterials, and alloys
show one reduction peak, and no oxidation peak appears in the reverse
scan, suggesting the irreversible nature of electrochemical reaction.
In order to show the plotting of voltammetric curves for identical
group materials very clearly, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed.
Typical linear sweep voltammograms taken for Ag, Cu, Ni, Ag100, Cu100, and Ni100 and alloy composites (Ag21Cu72Ni7, Ag29Cu61Ni10, Ag46Cu40Ni14, Ag54Cu30Ni16, Ag71Cu17Ni12, Ag81Cu12Ni7, and
Ag88Cu7Ni5) on the reduction of 100
mM of benzyl bromide in the absence and presence of CO2 containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4)/N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) at a sweep rate of 50 mV s–1 are shown in Figures 7 and 8, respectively.

linear sweep voltammograms taken in the presence of N2 and
CO2, respectively. The sweep rate was 50 mV s–1.

Background linear sweep voltammograms
taken for these materials
at 50 mV s–1 are shown as curve a in Figures 7A–F and 8A–G for comparison, and various electrochemical parameters
obtained from the linear sweep voltammograms are tabulated (Table 2). From the table,
it is noted that among the different metals and deposited nanomaterials,
Ag and Ag100 shows lower cathodic peak potential (−1.59
and −1.50 V vs Ag/AgCl respectively) and higher cathodic peak
current (2.12 and 4.95 mA cm–2) on the reduction
of benzyl bromide than Cu and Ni as well as Cu100 and Ni100, indicating their high catalytic behavior (Table 2, entries 1 to 6). Even Ag100 shows superior electrochemical activity over Ag (Table 2).

On the other hand, the increase of Ag content in the
AgxCuyNiz such as Ag21Cu72Ni7 and Ag29Cu61Ni10, can still
decrease the peak
potential and increase the peak current on the reduction of benzyl
bromide to some extent, when compared to Ag and Ag100 (Table 2, entries 7 and 8).
A highest peak current density of 10.24 mA/cm2 (almost
2.5 times enhancement) and lowest cathodic potential (−1.38
V) is noted for Ag46Cu40Ni14, indicating
its highest catalytic activity (Table 2, entry 9). Further incorporation of Ag in the alloys
(Ag54Cu30Ni16, Ag71Cu17Ni12, Ag81Cu12Ni7, and Ag88Cu7Ni5) results in a slow
increase of peak potential and current when compared to Ag46Cu40Ni14, revealing comparatively lower electrochemical
activity of the above materials (Table 2, entries 10 to 13). It is observed that when compared
to Ni and Ni100, Cu and Cu100 show good electrochemical
performance.

A similar trend on the LSV is noted on the reduction
of benzyl
bromide in the presence of CO2. The linear sweep voltammogram
shows a single irreversible cathodic peak on different metal electrodes,
deposited materials, and alloys. Once again, Ag and Ag100 exhibit higher catalytic behavior than that of Cu and Cu100 as well as Ni and Ni100. Further, Ag46Cu40Ni14 exhibits highest cathodic peak current (12.10
mA cm–2) and lowest cathodic peak potential (−2.10
V) in the presence of CO2 (Table 2), when compared to other nanomaterials and
alloys. Even Ag100 shows excellent catalytic behavior than
that of Ag. Few preliminary investigations confirm that no direct
reduction of CO2 takes place as its reduction potential
lies at −2.40–±20 mV on the alloy materials, which
is more negative than the reduction potential of benzyl bromide.

Constant potential electrolysis of benzyl bromide in the presence
of CO2 in 0.1 M TBABF4/DMF solution with an
optimum charge of 2.1 F mole–1 results in phenyl
acetic acid as a product on bulk Ag (58%) followed by the Ag100 (75%) (Table 2).
Moderate yield of the product was obtained on Cu and Cu100 followed by low yield on Ni as well as Ni100. On the
other hand, the yield of the product enhances with the increase of
Ag content on AgxCuyNiz, and a maximum yield (95%)
was noted on Ag46Cu40Ni14. With an
increase of Ag content beyond Ag46Cu40Ni14 (Ag54Cu30Ni16, Ag71Cu17Ni12, Ag81Cu12Ni7, and Ag88Cu7Ni5) results
in the decrease of the yield (Table 2). It is noted that the passed charge beyond 2.1 F
mole–1 does not show any significant effect on the
yield of the product. Further, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) results exhibit phenyl acetic acid as the major product
on all the electrodes, and there is no formation of the side product.
It is also observed that the yield efficiency significantly varies
at various potentials for different electrode materials. The yield
appears to be high in accordance with the peak potential, in which
the reduction of benzyl bromide takes place. Yield efficiency is found
to be low at high cathodic potential, where simultaneous reduction
of CO2 occurs resulting in side products.

The presence
of Ag, Cu, and Ni content in a certain amount in the
AgxCuyNiz alloy nanocomposites plays a significant
role of the control on the morphology of the material. By controlling
the composition of Ag, Cu, and Ni, high efficiency of the product
can be obtained in the electrocarboxylation process. This can also
be reflected on the maximum peak current density and low peak potential
obtained for Ag46Cu40Ni14 electrode
material on the electroreduction of benzyl bromide in the absence
and presence of CO2. This phenomenon can be attributed
to the enhanced surface roughness of Ag46Cu40Ni14 electrode material, which in-turn facilitates the
electro reduction of benzyl bromide to phenyl acetic acid. For further
validation, 2D and 3D, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images for different
alloy materials were taken and their surface roughness and skewness
values were calculated (Table 3).

s. no.	electrode
materials	average surface
roughness value (nm)	skewness
value	
1	Ag21Cu72Ni7	0.93	–0.42	
2	Ag29Cu61Ni10	2.84	–0.71	
3	Ag46Cu40Ni14	4.23	–1.66	
4	Ag54Cu30Ni16	3.94	–0.97	
5	Ag71Cu17Ni12	2.85	–0.82	
6	Ag81Cu12Ni7	1.78	–0.53	
7	Ag88Cu7Ni5	0.87	–0.21	
As a specific example, the AFM image of Ag46Cu40Ni14 deposit is shown in Figure 9. From the table, it is understandable that
Ag46Cu40Ni14 shows the highest average
surface roughness value of 4.23 nm and a high skewness value of −1.66,
revealing the presence of a large amount of porous material, when
compared to others. From this, it is understandable that further increase
of Ag and decrease of Cu do not show any benefit on the catalytic
activity of the alloy material. It is also observed that the presence
of a certain amount of Cu and Ni is essential, which can enhance the
porosity of the material, which in turn enhances surface roughness
of the deposits.

and half hours in TEATFA.

The present work clearly reveals that the AgxCuyNiz alloy nanocomposite, fabricated by electrodeposition in a
low cost
PIL medium, is an alternative to expensive Ag material for the electroreduction
of benzyl bromide in the presence of CO2. The previous
literature studies clearly reveal that the process involves the chemical
reaction between the electrogenerated anion radical PhCH2–• and CO2 with subsequent rapid
one electron reduction reaction in the formation of phenyl acetic
acid.10,36 The key step in the improvement in the yield
of the product involves the effective production of anion radicals
from the electroreduction of benzyl bromide in a highly porous structure
of the alloy material. Further research is going on to investigate
the attraction between the porous alloy nanocrystal structures and
PhCH2–•/CO2 species
on the reaction pattern.

Conclusions
Different weight percentages
of trimetallic nanomaterials containing
silver, copper, and nickel (AgxCuyNiz) along with
Ag100, Cu100, and Ni100 were electrodeposited
on the GC under potentiostatic conditions in TEATFA medium to investigate
their suitability as electrodes on the electroreduction of benzyl
bromide in the presence of carbon dioxide. Increase of Ag or Cu or
Ni content in the electrolyte mixture results in the increase of deposition
as well as stripping current of the respective ions, favoring efficient
codeposition, as investigated by the CV. Surface characteristic morphologies
obtained by SEM show cauliflower crystallites for the deposits of
Ag, whereas cubic porous and fine particles are noted for Cu and Ni
deposits, respectively. XRD confirms the crystalline nature of Ag
deposits and porous structure for the Cu as well as Ni, whereas alloy
composites exhibit the mixture of above three morphological features.
The morphology and the composition of AgxCuyNiz alloys
were controlled by altering the concentration of ionic species in
the electrolyte. LSV experiments in TBABF4/DMF demonstrate
that Ag46Cu40Ni14 shows higher cathodic
current and lower cathodic potential on the electroreduction of benzyl
bromide in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide, whereas constant
potential electrolysis reveals higher product yield on this electrode
than that of other alloys, nanomaterials, and bulk Ag, Cu, and Ni.

Experimental
Section
Nickel acetate Ni(CH3COO)2,
silver acetate
Ag(CH3COO), and copper acetate Cu(CH3COO)2 were obtained from across India. TEATFA was synthesized as
per our earlier work (Scheme 3)35 and was characterized by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

GC–MS
was performed using an Agilent 5975 C GC/MSD with
a triple-axis HED-EM detector and 7890A GC. The moisture content of
the PIL is around 50 ppm, as found out by a coulometric Karl–Fischer
titrator (Metrohm 756 KF). DMF (SRL-India), and tetrabutylammonium
tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4, AG Fluka) was kept over a vacuum
desiccator containing anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) for several days. Molecular sieves (4A) were added to the
solvent to eliminate moisture content prior to use. Benzyl bromide
was bought from AG Fluka.

Scheme 3 CV was carried out with an
Eco Chemie Autolab Potentiostat system
under computer control in a glovebox. The constant potential deposition
of the alloys was carried out in a conventional three-electrode setup,
where a GC served as a working electrode (Alfa Aesar with a purity
of 99.99%, exposed area is 0.07 cm2) along with Pt as a
counter electrode. The reference was a platinum wire immersed in a
ferrocene/ferrocenium (mole ratio of Fc/Fc + is 1/1) BMP–TFSI
solution stored in a glass tube with porous frit.

Potentiostatic
electrolysis of CO2 in the presence of
0.1 M benzyl bromide containing 0.1 M TBABF4/DMF (10 ml)
was carried out in an undivided cell containing Ag100,
Cu100, and Ni100 along with corresponding metal
electrodes as well as AgxCuyNiz alloys as cathodes,
where Mg served as a sacrificial anode and Ag/AgCl as a reference.
Prior to electrolysis, CO2 was bubbled into electrolyte
solution for 30 min to make sure saturation and bubbling were continued
throughout the electrolysis for maintaining the CO2 concentration
constant. Electrolysis was carried out at the potential of benzyl
bromide reduction with the passage of 2.1 F·mol–1 of charge by efficient stirring. When the electrolysis was completed,
the solvent was removed under reduced pressure followed by treatment
of aqueous HCl. The product was extracted with diethyl ether, washed
with aqueous NaCl solution, and dried. Ether evaporation leads to
the formation of phenyl acetic acid.36

The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded with a 400 MHz Bruker
NMR Spectrometer with TMS internal reference and CDCl3 as
solvent. Surface morphological characteristics of Ag100, Ni100, Cu100, and AgxCuyNiz deposit materials were determined with SEM (JEOL JSM6480LV system
coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer). Surface roughness
and skewness values were found out using AFM with Agilent Technology
Inc., SPM 5500. XRD (Shimadzu XD-D1 X-ray diffractometer) was used
to investigate the crystallinity of the materials. AAS (GBC 906 AA,
Australia) was employed to estimate the weight percentages of Ag,
Cu, and Ni species present in AgxCuyNiz alloy. The
deposited materials were dissolved in 20 mL of 5% HNO3,
where 5 mL of solution was pipetted out from this solution, made up
to 50 mL, and utilized for the AAS analysis.
