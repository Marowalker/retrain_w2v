This work reports a strategy based on γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(KH550) and graphene oxide (GO)-functionalized 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide
(DOPO) to fabricate P–N–Si integrated flame retardant
[KDOPO-modified GO (DGO)] through mild Mannich and Silanization reactions
to overcome the challenge of single gas-phase fire retardancy of DOPO.
DGO-based phenolic epoxy resin (DGO/PER) is manufactured and coated
on the surface of expandable polystyrene (EPS) foam plates to achieve
fire safety, which is used as the thermally insulating external wall
in buildings and constructions. The DGO/PER paintcoat imparts high
fire safety to the EPS foam plate, exhibiting a high limiting oxygen
index value of 29%, and a UL-94 V-0 classification is achieved with
only 300 μm of layer thickness compared with the DOPO/PER paintcoat.
Meanwhile, all combustion parameters such as peak heat release rate,
heat release rate, total heat release, smoke release rate, total smoke
rate, and ignition time present excellent promotions for EPS@DGO compared
with EPS@DOPO. These dramatically reduced fire hazards are mainly
attributed to the synergistic effects of DGO. Meanwhile, the DGO/PER
flame-retardant paintcoat cannot deteriorate the thermal insulation
performance of the EPS foam plate.

==== Body
Introduction
Presently, expandable polystyrene (EPS)
foam has been extensively
applied in construction, packing materials, cushioning, marine, and
automobile because of its appealing features such as excellent thermal
insulation properties, shock absorption, noise reduction properties,
moisture resistance, good chemical resistance, convenience of processing,
light weight, low cost, and so forth.1−3 However, EPS foam is
extremely flammable because of its interior beehive structure with
large surface areas, and abundant toxic smoke may be released during
combustion because of the existence of benzene in the molecule.4,5 Therefore, it is imperative to improve the flame-resistance properties
of EPS foams to ensure the safety of people’s lives and properties.
Nowadays, flame retardation of EPS foams is mainly achieved in the
industry by halogen-containing flame retardants. Nevertheless, these
halogenated flame retardants are now considered global pollutants
with adverse effects on animal and human health.6−8 Therefore, halogen-free
flame retardation for EPS foams is an urgent issue. Among the “greener”
halogen-free flame retardants, silicon, phosphorus, and/or nitrogen
are the most popular elements.9−14 Recently phosphorus flame retardants have been widely investigated
because they can catalyze char formation in the condensed phase and/or
capture active radicals in the gas phase.15−17 Among these
phosphorus flame retardants,18 reactive
flame retardant 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide
(DOPO) and its derivatives have attracted more and more attention
because of their high thermal stability, good oxidation, and water
resistance due to their stable aromatic structure.19,20 However, since it is impossible to form a carbon layer after combustion,
the main function of DOPO derivatives is to suppress the flame into
the gas phase.21 In order to improve their
flame retardancy, DOPO derivatives with P–C, P–N, and
P–O bond functions have been developed.22−25 However, their high flame-retardant
efficiency is usually achieved by a high flame-retardant loading.
Nevertheless, based on the manufacturing process, flame-retardant
EPS foams can be mainly obtained through adding a flame retardant
in the polymerization stage and foaming process. Unfortunately, the
additive of a flame retardant may seriously interfere with polymerization,
leading to high residual styrene concentrations, and also affect the
foaming process because of the diversity of flame retardants.26,27 Recently, the microencapsulation method with halogen-free flame
retardants has become a promising way to protect materials against
fire because of the simplicity of processing.28,29 For this method, the adhesion between the flame retardant and the
EPS surface is a key problem to be considered. The commonly used binders
are thermosetting phenolic resins and epoxy resins because of their
inherent fire resistance after curing and their good compatibility
with EPS beads and inorganic fillers.30 However, curing techniques of thermosetting resins are usually difficult
to coordinate with the foaming techniques of EPS. Even though they
can proceed simultaneously, the curing process of thermosetting resins
also interferes with the foaming process of EPS more or less. Layer-by-layer
(LbL) assembly is considered as another versatile and cost-effective
strategy to construct a fire protection coating for material substrates.31,32 In particular, LbL technique has been involved in constructing flame-retardant
coating directly toward EPS foams, which avoids interfering with the
foaming process. Nevertheless, the surface nature of material substrates,
including the roughness and density of polar groups, plays a key role
in the multilayer growth. Hence, it is not easy to deposit a flame-retardant
coating on a nonpolar EPS substrate in the beginning.33 Therefore, the flame-retardant technology for EPS foam
is another urgent issue.

According to the results and discussions
aforementioned, to develop
efficient flame retardants based on synergistic combinations of multiple
elements and a simple and efficient flame-retardant technology, a
novel phosphorus–nitrogen–silicon flame retardant based
on DOPO in conjunction with a nanofiller is designed to endow it with
improved flame-retardant performance through a simple surface-coating
method. It endows DOPO to act either in the gas phase via flame inhibition
or in the condensed phase via char formation simultaneously. As one
of the representative nanofillers, the presence of potassium salt
impurities and the laminated structure with ultrahigh specific surface
areas make graphene oxide (GO) become highly flammable.34

The flame retardant for bulk polymer composites
requires higher
loading than a coated one because it is diluted by the polymer matrix.35 For the flame-retardant surface-coating method
we proposed, the adhesive between flame retardants and EPS foams is
a newly developed phenolic epoxy resin (PER); it exhibits good heat
resistance, inherent fire resistance, and high mechanical performance
as well as suitable curing process in comparison with the thermosetting
phenolic resins36 and epoxy resins.37 The developed phosphorus–nitrogen–silicon
flame retardant based on DOPO further decorated with GO can solve
reagglomeration of GO and migration of DOPO in the polymer matrix.
Their synergistic effects can significantly give EPS foam plates an
excellent flame-retardant performance.

Results and Discussion
Chemical Structure of KDOPO and DGO
Typical characteristic
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorptions show the successful
modifications of both DOPO with KH550 (Figure 1a) and KH550-modified DOPO (KDOPO) with GO
(Figure 1b). The characteristic
absorption bands of DOPO38−40 and KH55041 are summarized in Table 1. After DOPO is modified with KH550, the absorption
peak of KDOPO at 2433 cm–1, which is associated
with P–H, significantly disappears. Besides, some characteristic
bands associated with DOPO and KH550, such as P=O (1287 cm–1), P–Ph (1430 cm–1) and P–O–Ph
(1139 and 1097 cm–1) functional groups, −CH3 (2943 cm–1), −CH2–
(2881 cm–1), and Si–O (1028 cm–1) can still be found in the FT-IR spectrum of KDOPO. These results
illustrate that the P–H groups of DOPO have reacted with NH2 groups of KH550 and that KDOPO has been prepared successfully.
The oxygen-containing functional groups indicating GO are summarized
in Table 1.42,43 After KDOPO is modified with GO, some typical absorption peaks of
oxygen-containing groups, O–H stretching vibration (3048 cm–1), C=O stretching vibration (1727 cm–1), C=C stretching vibration (1629 cm–1),
and C–O–C stretching vibration (1398 cm–1) are presented. These results illustrate that KDOPO-modified GO
(DGO) has been prepared successfully.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectra also are
applied to prove
the success in the functionalization of DOPO. Figure 1c shows the XRD patterns of GO, DOPO, KDOPO,
and DGO. The characteristic diffraction peaks of DGO present the characteristic
diffraction peak of GO located at 2θ = 11.6°, corresponding
to the (002) reflection of GO20 and the
characteristic diffraction peak of KDOPO located at 2θ = 21.6°. Figure 1d presents the Raman
spectra of GO and DGO. Both samples show the existence of D and G
bands at 1351 and 1603 cm–1, respectively. In general,
the intensity ratio of D to G bands (ID/IG) monitors the disordered structure
and defects inside the nanocarbon and hence provides implication for
the functionalization status of nanocarbons. ID/IG for DGO increases from 0.59
to 0.76, and the XRD pattern information of DGO indicates chemical
modification success between KDOPO and GO.

Microstructure and Thermal Behavior of KDOPO and DGO
The microstructure also reveals that DOPO presents a flat and smooth
surface (Figure 2a).
Relatively rough morphological features are observed for KDOPO (Figure 2b). A tight interface
between KDOPO and GO can continually be observed (Figure 2d).

Figure 2 Microstructure of DOPO
(a), KDOPO (b), GO (c), and DGO (d).

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
thermogravimetric
(DTG) curves of DOPO, KDOPO, and DGO composites under the nitrogen
atmosphere are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, although the degradation of KDOPO and DGO
occurs earlier than DOPO, with multi decomposition steps, the degradation
rate is relatively slower than that of DOPO at the same temperature.
The temperature at a maximum mass loss (Tmax) of DOPO is at 349.8 °C. In comparison with DOPO, Tmax of DGO increases from 349.8 to 494.9 °C. The
char residues of DOPO at 800 °C are nearly 0 wt %. So, the fire-retardant
mechanism of DOPO only attributes to the gas-phase fire retardancy.
Significantly, DGO can obviously improve the char yield with 28.7
wt % char residues at 800 °C. Obviously, DGO can act either only
in the gas phase via flame inhibition or in the condensed phase (via
char formation) with synergistic combination of silicon, phosphorus,
and nitrogen simultaneously.

for DOPO, KDOPO,
and DGO.

Flame Retardance and Combustion Behavior of EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO
Table 2 shows the
synergistic effects of DGO on the limiting oxygen index (LOI) value
and UL-94 rating for EPS@DGO foam plates. As listed in Table 2, the presence of the highest
amount of DOPO (20 wt %) does not significantly improve the LOI value
(LOI = 26%), whereas by substituting 10 wt % DGO in the EPS@DGO10
sample, the LOI value could be the same as EPS@DOPO20. Furthermore,
V-0 rating can be easily obtained when the loading of DGO is more
than 15 wt %, and the LOI value increases to greater than 28%. These
results reflect the synergistic effect of the P–N–Si
integrated flame retardant (DGO) on the EPS@DGO foam plate.

Digital photos of the external residues collected
after the cone
calorimeter test (CCT) for EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO foam plates are portrayed
in Figure 4. It can
be observed that the neat EPS left nothing, and the char residues
of EPS@DOPO is little and poor in expansibility. In contrast, rigid
and well-expanded char residues are formed for EPS@DGO. The mass of
char residues is increased by loading DGO. Actually, this rigid char
layer acts as a protective shield resulting in improvement of flame-retardant
performance of EPS foam plates.

Figure 4 Digital images of char residues of EPS@DOPO
and EPS@DGO foam plates
after CCT.

CCT is still one of the most important and useful
standard tests
for assessing flammability as it is directly related to the actual
fire situation, and the corresponding parameters are shown in Figure 5 and Table 3. It is seen that EPS foam plate
burns rapidly after super short ignition time (Tign) of 3 s with a peak heat release rate (PHRR) of 493.9 kW/m2 and a total heat release (THR) of 74.32 MJ/m2 at
the end of the test. When the flame-retardant paintcoat, which like
a protective clothing for EPS foam plate, is coated on the surface
of EPS, the PHRR and THR of EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO foam plates are significantly
reduced below those of EPS foam plates. Significantly, DGO/PER paintcoat
has excellent flame-retardant property than the DOPO/PER paintcoat
with the same flame-retardant loading.

and EPS@DGO foam plates under an external

and (d) TSR.

It is worth highlighting that EPS@DGO20 performs the
best in enhancing
the flame retardancy and exhibits the largest reduction in the PHRR
and THR among the above paintcoat loadings, and PHRR and THR are reduced
to 304.6 kW/m2 and 39.9 MJ/m2, respectively.
Equivalently, PHRR and THR of EPS@DGO20 are reduced by 38.4 and 46.3%,
respectively, compared with those of EPS, and reduced by 6.2 and 18.2%
compared with those of EPS@DOPO20. The results indicate that the formation
of an effective char layer during combustion can act as an insulating
barrier between fire and the polymer matrix, which can prevent the
exchange of heat and flammable gases. Moreover, the fire performance
index (FPI), defined as the ratio of PHRR to Tign, also characterizes an indication of flashover property.
Generally, the lower the ratio, the lower the flashover propensity.13,14Table 3 indicates
that FPI of EPS@DGO20 significantly decreases to 9.8 and dramatically
reduces by 94.0 and 30.5% in comparison with those of EPS and EPS@DOPO20
foam plates. These results indicate that the DGO/PER flame retardant
can produce less fire hazards and provide a longer evacuation time
in case of fire.

The smoke released from the combustion of materials
is also one
of the most significant factors as most of casualties in fires are
caused by asphyxia. The dynamic smoke production behaviors of EPS@DOPO
and EPS@DGO foam plates are characterized by the smoke release rate
(RSR) and the total smoke rate (TSR) as shown in Figures 5c,d. P-RSR and TSR of EPS@DGO20
are 16.2 s–1 and 1794.5 m2/m2, which reduce by 61.3 and 62.9%, in comparison with those of neat
EPS and reduce by 7.4 and 12.2% in comparison with those of EPS@DOPO20,
respectively. These results indicate that the DGO flame retardant
can more effectively act as the smoke suppression agent because of
the synergistic flame-retardant effects of P–N–Si integrated
elements in DGO and can obviously increase the chances of survival
than DOPO.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of
char residues
of EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO after CCTs are shown in Figure 6. The char residues formed from EPS@DOPO
display a discontinuous and loose morphology, some large holes, probably
due to the rapid release of degradation products in a short time,
and large cracks, probably due to the low strength of the char residue
layer. Thus, the char residue layers of EPS@DOPO could not provide
an effective barrier for the underlying materials during combustion.
Compared with the char morphology of EPS@DOPO foam plates, a more
compact and continuous microstructure is formed for EPS@DGO foam plates,
and relatively less holes can be found. The reason for this phenomenon
is the relatively slower release of volatile gases during thermal
degradation and the higher charring ability of DGO/PER than EPS@DOPO.
Increasing the loading of DGO further leads to the formation of a
more tight and thick framework on the surface of the char as well
as fewer and smaller holes. These analyses are consistent with the
results of the digital images of the char residues as shown in Figure 4. Both mass and heat
transfers can be impeded by the more compact char layer, which is
responsible for the better flame retardancy of EPS@DGO foam plates.
A strong microstructure with tiny pores indicates that the existence
of GO in DGO is conducive to the enhancement of strength of char residues.

of char residues after the CCT test.

Thermal Behavior of EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO
Compared to
that of EPS foam plate, thermal conductivity of EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO
foam plates expresses not much increase, as shown in Figure 7, even though when the DGO
content is as high as 20 phr, the thermal conductivity of EPS@DGO20
just increases to 0.047 Wm–1 K–1 by 6.8%. It does not obviously deteriorate the thermal insulation
property.44

Figure 7 Thermal conductivity
of EPS and EPS@APP foam plates.

Flame-Retardant Mechanism
Flame-retardant mechanism
is crucial for a flame-retardant system because the mechanism is clearly
studied in order to better deploy the flame-retardant system. The
flame-resistance mechanism of the DGO/PER paintcoat system is proposed
in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Schematic illustration
of the DGO flame-retardant mechanism.

The reason might be related to the gas-phase and
condensed-phase
synergitic flame-retardant mechanisms of PER and DGO. Phosphorus-containing
compounds in DGO catalyze char formation in the condensed phase and/or
release small low-energy radicals (PO*) to capture active radicals
in the gas phase.17 A further formed positive
silica layer in the condensed phase protects the matrix against degradation
based on silicon-containing compounds in DGO.17 Nitrogenous compounds in DGO generate inert gases that can dilute
the combustible materials and heat in the flame.45 Another indispensable flame-retardant factor can be attributed
to the GO sheet in DGO. GO sheet in DGO can form a “tortuous
path” and effectively retard the release rate of the volatile
products (Figure 8).46,47 Moreover, GO sheet could enhance the strength of char layers to
form a strong and compact char layer.48 The formed strong and compact char layer not only isolates the underlying
matrix from the external combustible gases and thermal feedback and
hinders the escape of pyrolysis volatile gases but also restricts
the motion of the polymer melts,49 which
is beneficial for enhancing the antidripping properties of EPS foam
plates; additionally, the barrier and reinforced effects of GO sheets
play a crucial role in imparting antidripping properties to EPS foam
plates.50

Experimental Details
Materials
EPS beads, with a granule size of 0.9–1.4
mm, were an industrial product of King Pearl Non-Modified EPS Co.,
Ltd, China. PER (type is F-44-80) was supplied by Marine Chemical
Research Institute, China. Low-molecular-weight polyamide curing agent
(SY-H115: the amine value is 220 ± 25 mgKOH/g and AHEW is 180)
was supplied by Marine Chemical Research Institute, China. DOPO was
generously supplied by Shandong He Zhan Chemical Co., Ltd, China.
GO (9 mg/mL) was supplied by Changzhou Sixth Element Co. Ltd. (China).
γ-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (KH550) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Technology Co., LTD (China).

Preparation of EPS Foam Plates
The original EPS beads
were pre-expanded in an expansion apparatus (steam oven) at 90 °C
for 5 min. The pre-expanded EPS beads were aged for 24 h before use.
Pre-expanded EPS beads with a foaming ratio of 40–60 can be
obtained. After that, the pre-expanded EPS beads were pressed in a
compression molding machine (George Moore press, UK) at 120 °C
for 5 min and 3.94 × 104 kg/m2 ram dia
pressure. The obtained EPS foam plates were removed when the mold
was cooled to room temperature.

Preparation of DGO Flame Retardant
DOPO (0.05 mol)
was added into a vial containing 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran and then
heated to 40 °C and stirred until complete dissolution. Then,
11.68 mL of KH550 (0.05 mol) and 1.84 mL of formaldehyde (0.05 mol)
were added to the mixture and heated to 70 °C with mild stirring
for 1 h according to Mannich reaction, and KDOPO was prepared. Subsequently,
60 mL of GO slurry (9 mg/mL) was reacted with KDOPO tetrahydrofuran
solution at 50 °C for 30 min according to silanization.51,52 Finally, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and centrifuged
with 9000 rpm for 10 min to remove the supernatant liquid product.
DGO was obtained after drying in a vacuum oven under 60 °C for
48 h.

Preparation of DGO/PER Compound Flame Retardant
DGO
(10 g) was dispersed into 12 mL of ethanol solution and then mechanically
mixed for 30 min. Subsequently, 20 g of PER and 12 g of SY-H115 were
added to the DGO mixture with stirring. A stable and compatible inorganic–organic
hybrid binder (DGO/PER) was prepared followed by these steps. For
comparison, the reference sample of DOPO/PER compound flame retardant
binder was prepared by the same process.

Preparation of EPS@DOPO and EPS@DGO Foam Plates
The
process to produce flame-retarded EPS@DGO foam plates is illustrated
in Scheme 1. The formulation
is summarized in Table 4. The surface of EPS foam plates was coated with the calculated amount
of DGO/PER flame retardant binder until a homogeneous physical blocking
layer was formed after coating twice. Finally, EPS@DGO foam plates
with a thin physical barrier layer were postcured at room temperature
for 24 h. For comparison, the reference sample of EPS@DOPO was prepared
by the same process.

Characterization
FT-IR spectra were recorded with a
Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) using the attenuated
total reflectance model with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and 32 scans. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra
were performed on a TU-1901PC spectrophotometer. XRD pattern was recorded
on a Rigaku D-MAX2500-PC diffractometer. Raman spectra were recorded
using a high-resolution FRS-100S (Bruker, Germany) machine with a
CCD detector. The spectral purity was quoted to be <700 at a wavelength
>2100 cm–1 from a set wavelength. The morphology
of char residues was observed using a JSM-6700F (Japan Electronics
Corp.) microscope. TGA measurement was carried out using a TGA-7 type
thermo-analysis instrument (Perkine Elmer Company, USA) from room
temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under
a N2 atmosphere. LOI was measured using a HC-2 oxygen index
meter (Jiangning Analysis Instrument Company, China). UL-94 vertical
burning test was performed on a vertical burning instrument (CFZ-1
type, Jiangning Analysis Instrument Co., China). The CCT was performed
on the cone calorimeter (Fire Testing Technology, U.K.). Each specimen
was wrapped in an aluminum foil and exposed horizontally to 50 kW/m2 external heat flux.

Conclusions
The aim of our study was to investigate
synergistic high flame-retardant
EPS foam plates through an effective protective surface-coating method.
Considering its convenient operation and high efficiency, the facile
method was developed to construct P–N–Si integrated
flame-retardant (DGO) paintcoat based on PER in EPS foam plates. The
LOI values of EPS@DGO15 and EPS@DGO20 foam plates increased, respectively,
up to 28 and 29%, and a V-0 rating for them was achieved. Besides,
P-RSR and TSR of EPS@DGO20 were 16.2 s–1 and 1794.5
m2/m2, which reduced by 61.3 and 62.9% in comparison
with those of neat EPS and reduced by 7.4 and 12.2% in comparison
with those of EPS@DOPO20. FPI of EPS@DGO20 significantly decreased
to 9.8 and dramatically reduced by 94.0 and 30.5% in comparison with
those of EPS and EPS@DOPO20. These results indicated that the DGO/PER
flame-retardant paintcoat produced less fire hazards and provided
a longer evacuation time in case of fire to effectively develop flame-retardant
ability and improved significantly fire safety of EPS foam plates
in buildings and constructions, thereby importantly reducing the secondary
disaster induced by fire without deteriorating the thermal insulation
performance of EPS foam plates.
