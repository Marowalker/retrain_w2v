Au-modified
hematite photoanode was screened for photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water oxidation by the scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)
technique with a scanning probe of the optical fiber for visible light
irradiation of the photoanode substrate. The Au-modified hematite
exhibited an enhancement in the photocurrent up to 3% (at. %), and
the performance drop was observed with 4–10% (at. %) of Au
modification. Subsequently, pristine and Au-modified hematite thin-film
photoanodes were fabricated by the spin-coating method to confirm
the results of SECM. The PEC response confirms that 3% (at. %) of
Au is the optimum concentration to provide the best enhancement of
PEC water oxidation with a ∼6-fold increase compared to the
pristine hematite sample. Direct Au oxidation, charge recombination,
and strong light absorption by Au are responsible for the decrease
in PEC performance when the Au percentage is above 3%. The pristine
and Au-modified hematite materials were also characterized by scanning
electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Au was found
to exist in the form of embedded metallic nanoparticles in the modified
hematite. Mott–Schottky analysis of the bulk samples confirms
an improvement in charge carrier density for the Au-modified hematite.
Additionally, there was little plasmonic enhancement as evidenced
by UV–vis spectroscopy, with a minimal contribution toward
photoactivity. Surface interrogation SECM quantitatively probed the
reactive surface states (RSSs) such as OH• formed
on hematite and Au-modified hematite surfaces during water oxidation.
The coverage of RSSs was found to increase with the substrate potential.
The interrogated charge under the dark condition for the 3% Au-modified
hematite sample is higher than the pristine hematite sample because
of the enhanced electronic conductivity of the hematite film.

1 Introduction
Solar cells are the best
example for the direct production of electricity
by harvesting and converting solar energy to electric energy.1−3 Solar fuel generation through a photoelectrochemical (PEC) system
provides promising applications in solar energy storage by harvesting
and storing solar energy into chemical bonds.4−6 PEC water splitting
has been studied intensively for sustainable solar hydrogen since
the first demonstration of unassisted water splitting for hydrogen
at a semiconductor electrode of TiO2.7−11 Many visible light-sensitive photocatalysts of metal
oxides (e.g., BaLa4Ti4O1512 and Co–BiVO413) have been investigated for solar energy-driven water splitting
reactions because of their tunable band gap and visible light absorptivity
and reasonable stability under harsh conditions in a PEC cell.14−17

n-Type hematite (α-Fe2O3) is considered
as an ideal photocatalytic material of choice for PEC water oxidation
because of its good chemical stability, strong visible light absorption,
and low cost.18−22 However, its poor conductivity and short hole-diffusion length are
the major limiting factors that dictate the photoactivity of hematite.
Several efforts of surface passivation,23−26 nanostructuring,27−30 heterojunction,31,32 and doping with higher conductive
materials have been made to overcome these issues.33−37 Different doping materials have been utilized to
enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of hematite. For example, Pt,
Pd, Ta, Au, and Ag have been incorporated into the powdered and thin-film
hematite to suppress the charge recombination and to promote the charge-transfer
processes of photogenerated electrons and holes at the photocatalyst/electrolyte
interfaces.38−40 In our previous studies,41,42 the Au nanoparticles (NPs) and Au nanorods (NRs) have been successfully
incorporated in hematite thin films to improve the photoactivity for
solar water splitting. It was discovered that Au NPs deposited underneath
the hematite film increased the light absorption cross-section in
the visible region, because of their localized surface plasmon resonance
(LSPR), and charge collection from hematite thereby leading to maximizing
the photogenerated charge carriers in the film for the enhanced water-splitting
reaction. Recent literature studies on Au-decorated hematite photoanode
for solar water splitting are summarized in Table 1. Among these representative works, the major
contributions from Au nanostructures to the enhancement of photoactivity
of hematite include (1) efficient charge separation, (2) improved
bulk charge transport, (3) plasmonic light absorption enhancement,
and (4) surface catalytic activity of Au. Although few studies have
revealed the optimum percentage for Au in hematite photocatalysts,
it is not clear what forms of Au (e.g., NP or atomic doping) and percentage
of Au are optimum for enhancing hematite PEC activities. It is also
not yet clear how the optical configuration (e.g., surface vs bottom
modification configurations) of Au modification affects the PEC activities
of a photoelectrode. One of the best approaches to identify the concentration
effects of such metallic nanostructures on a catalyst is to utilize
a rapid screening and optimizing technique called scanning electrochemical
microscopy (SECM) with a scanning optical fiber. In this operation
mode of SECM technique, an optical fiber is used to illuminate a photocatalytic
array, while photocurrent response of the array is recorded to provide
the spatial distribution of its PEC activity.43,44 Jang et al.45 studied the photoactivity
of the Ag–hematite nanocomposite by SECM for water oxidation
with different compositions of Ag and Fe. Such composite hematite
was further doped with Sn and found the optimum condition for water
oxidation with 50–50% Ag–Fe and 2% Sn. In the follow-up
study,40 Ta-doped hematite was investigated
by SECM, yielding ∼32 times increment in photocurrent by 2%
of Ta doping as against the pristine sample. The preferential growth
of Ta along the (001) facet of hematite greatly improved the conductivity
of the film thereby enhancing the photoactivity. Recently, Conzuelo
and co-workers46 utilized the SECM technique
to provide information about the local photocurrent generated at photocatalytic
surfaces of TiO2 and BiVO4 photoanodes with X, Y grid increment of 20 μm. SECM
has also been used to investigate the plasmonic enhancement for PEC
reactions. For example, the enhancement mechanism of photo-induced
hot carriers and thermal effect by light illumination can be isolated
and studied independently by the SECM technique.47 Zhou et al.48 studied TiO2 photoanodes with subsurface Al nanodimers under different
excitation directions and light polarization angles to investigate
the impact on photoanode reactions.

Herein, we present the screening
of the photocatalytic Au-modified
hematite for solar water oxidation by SECM with a scanning optical
fiber. The SECM performance of photocatalytic spots prepared with
pL dispenser methodis compared with that of thin-film electrodes
to reveal the effects of Au on PEC performance of hematite. The surface
interrogation mode of scanning electrochemical spectroscopy (SI-SECM)
is used to quantitatively measure the reactive surface states (RSSs)
such as OH• formed on hematite surfaces. This study
suggested that Au exists in the form of well-distributed and embedded
NPs into the hematite film. Au modification significantly contributed
to the electronic conductivity of the hematite film with PEC enhancement
obtained at <3.0 at. % of Au. These findings are well supported
by surface characterization techniques and the capacitance measurements.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 SECM for Searching Optimal
Au Concentration
of the Hematite Photoanode
The SECM screening technique with
a 200 μm (in diam.) optical fiber is used to study the localized
PEC activity of the photocatalyst array. This scanning technique is
briefly described in the experimental section. More details of this
screening technique are described in recent publications.13,14,44Figure 1A shows the array design for studying Au
effects on PEC of hematite spots produced by the PL dispensing technique
as described in the experimental section. The top three rows and the
bottom three rows of the array were control spots containing only
hematite in the absence of Au. This allows one to level the substrate
and minimize the random errors caused by the PL dispensing technique
from droplet to droplet. The middle four rows are four replicates
of the Au-modified spots with Au concentration varying from 1 to 10%
from left to right in order to have an average PEC response without
reproducibility concerns of the dispensing technique. Figure 1B shows the two-dimensional
SECM photocurrent images of Au-modified hematite arrays prepared on
the Ti substrate with varying Au percentages at the substrate potential
equal to 0.3 V versus Ag/AgCl. The top and bottom three row control
spots show identical photocurrent responses as reference, while the
middle four rows show the variance of photocurrent with 1–10%
of Au modification. The raster scan of the array with the optical
fiber under white light illumination from a xenon lamp produces photocurrent
response at each location at a substrate potential of 0.3 V (Figure 1C) and 0.5 V (Figure 1D) versus Ag/AgCl.
These SECM photocurrent images were obtained at a step size of 100
μm in XY directions and a parking distance
of 100 μm from the fiber to the sample surface. These SECM results
clearly indicate that an improved photocurrent can be obtained with
1–3% of Au modification. The modification has a negative effect
on the photocurrent for 4–10% of Au. It should be noted that
background current in the SECM images is greatly eliminated at a higher
potential applied (0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl) as shown in Figure 1C because of a higher PEC current
than that at  0.3 V. We also obtained more pronounced Au effects
at the large substrate potential because of high PEC current response
in the more positive potential bias. As shown in Figure 1D, the average current from
pristine and Au-modified hematite spots in their respective columns
are plotted against Au percentage. It clearly shows that the average
photocurrent response of hematite is enhanced by the Au percentage
until 3% Au. This result obtained on the Ti substrate is consistent
with the ones obtained on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates,
agreeing that 3% of Au modification provides the best PEC enhancement
for the hematite photoanode. In order to validate the results obtained
from arrays produced by the droplet dispensing technique, thin-film
samples containing 1, 3, 5, and 10% of Au are also prepared to compare
with the SECM study.

the array with a 200 μm (in diam.) optical fiber illuminated
with a xenon lamp; and (D) statistical averaging analysis of the PEC
current dependence on Au percentage, revealing the PEC performance
increment for 1–3% of Au modification followed by gradual decrease
for 4–10% of Au modification.

2.2 Absorption Spectra and Morphology of Au-Modified
Hematite Thin Films
Thin-film hematite samples were prepared
directly from ethylene glycol (EG) solution containing Fe(NO3)3 and HAuCl4. The spin-coated film of Fe(NO3)3 decomposed to hematite and NO2 and
oxygen in the air at elevated temperature. UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy was performed for the spin-coated samples as shown in Figure 2. The absorption
of Au-modified samples decreases in the wavelength region of 300–550
nm, where the major contribution for absorption in this wavelength
range is hematite. The relative hematite ratio decreases as Au percentage
rises. From 550 to 800 nm, the absorption slightly increases with
the amount of Au because of the increase in the absorption of Au
NPs, but this plasmon absorption above 3% provides only a small light
absorption increase, that cannot support  the pronounced PEC
enhancement obtained from our SECM study. Thus, plasmonic enhancement
by Au has a minimal contribution to the photoactivity of hematite
for water oxidation. Accurate thickness control of the sample fabrication
would bring more precise absorption comparison.

Figure 2 UV–vis spectra
of pristine and Au-modified hematite photocatalysts
with 1, 3, 5, and 10% of Au (at. %).

To understand how Au modification on the hematite film affects
the PEC performance and its spatial distribution in the hematite film,
topside and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis
was performed. Figure 3 shows the SEM images obtained for the Au-incorporated hematite
array for 1, 3, 5, and 10% of Au concentration. These SEM images suggest
that  Au exists as NPs and are evenly distributed in hematite
film with an average particle size of ∼20 nm. EG serves as
a reducing agent of HAuCl4 to produce Au NPs during the
thermal annealing process of the hematite film. The Au particles number
increases with the increase of Au percentage and reaches a maximum
at 10% Au concentration. As stated earlier, the light absorption increase
shown in Figure 2 from
Au NPs near the wavelength region of 500–800 nm cannot help
justify the pronounced PEC performance enhancement by 3% Au, yet increase
in light absorption and scattering in this region by densely packed
Au NPs can decrease the light absorption of hematite to decrease its
PEC activity.  Figure 4 shows the cross-sectional SEM image of spin-coated Au-incorporated
hematite thin film. The average Au–hematite film thickness
is about 100 nm on a ∼270 nm thickness FTO substrate, as shown
in the figure.

(b), 5 (c) and 10% (d) of Au in the film.

2.3 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Characterization
of Au-Modified Hematite Thin Film
To understand the chemical
identity of Au in the hematite sample, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was performed for pristine and optimized 3% Au-modified
Fe2O3 thin-film samples prepared on FTO by the
spin coating method. Figure 5 shows the survey spectra of pristine and 3% Au-incorporated
Fe2O3 samples. Survey spectra of both the samples
reveal XPS lines of Sn, which has been reported previously by several
researchers for the Fe2O3 films prepared on
FTO (F:SnO2). Sn diffuses from FTO substrate upon annealing
the samples at temperatures ≥ 500 °C.39,61−63 The elemental compositions obtained for Fe 2p, O
1s, Sn 3d, and Au 4f lines are listed in Table 2. The relative concentration of Au on the
surface of hematite is only 1.3% compare to Fe, which is due to the
presence of scattered Au 20–30 nm size NPs as observed from
SEM study previously (Figure 3). Figure 6 shows the high-resolution XPS spectra of the Fe 2p, O 1s, Sn 3d,
and Au 4f lines for the 3% Au-modified hematite film. As shown in Figure 6A, the Fe 2p3/2 binding energy (BE) peak at 709.91 ± 0.1 eV confirms
the +3-oxidation state of Fe and the formation of hematite (α-Fe2O3) phase.63 The deconvoluted
O 1s peak demonstrates four types of oxygen species (Figure 6B). The O 1s (Fe–O)
peak at ∼529.81 ± 0.1 eV originates from the Fe2O3 moiety. The peaks O 1s (O–Sn) at 531.01 eV is
ascribed to Sn-oxide, which is formed due to the diffusion of Sn4+ ions to the hematite surface from FTO. The O 1s (O–C/O–H)
peak at 531.93 eV and minor O 1s (O–Si) peak at 533.04 eV are
due to adsorbed carbonyl/hydroxyl groups and surface impurity, respectively.
The Sn 3d5/2 peak at 486.98 ± 0.1 eV and a spin–orbit
splitting (Δ = 8.4 eV) of doublet lines for Sn 3d spectrum confirm
the presence of Sn4+ state (Figure 6C). The BE of Au 4f7/2 peak at
83.97 ± 0.1 eV and spin–orbit splitting (Δ = 3.7
eV) of doublet lines for Au 4f confirms that gold exists in metallic
NPs form on the surface of the hematite film (Figure 6D). The absence of any peak at 86 eV excludes
the possibility of gold oxidation. As seen from Table 2, the Sn content in pristine and Au-incorporated
hematite films is almost identical (∼0.2 at. %). Hence, the
PEC performances of both pristine and Au-incorporated hematite should
not be affected by Sn.

2.4 PEC Characterization of Au-Modified Hematite
Thin Film Photoanode Electrodes
Based on the above SECM study,
it is conclusive to say that PEC performance enhancement is observed
at low Au percentage while decrement in PEC performance is noticed
when Au percentage exceeds 3% Au modification. To further understand
the Au modification effects, a bulk thin film with the large
area was prepared using the spin-coating method to obtain an improved
understanding of the Au effect mechanism. Figure 7 shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of pristine and Au-modified
hematite thin-film photoanodes fabricated by the spin-coating method,
under standard 1 sun illumination measured in 0.1 M NaOH. The 3% Au-modified
hematite thin film exhibits remarkable net PEC response with ∼6
folds increase in photocurrent density at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl (∼1.0
V vs RHE) with respect to the pristine hematite electrode. Such improved
performance can further be improved by controlling the film thickness.
Furthermore, there is an oxidation peak at around 0 V versus Ag/AgCl
under the dark condition for 5% and 10% Au, which is attributed to
the oxidation of Au in direct contact with electrolyte.64 The high percentage of Au above 3% will form
conductive channels through the hematite film to allow charge recombination,
decreasing the photocurrent. Au NPs are separated from each other
below 3% Au modification to provide direct electrochemical oxidation.
Action spectra were recorded for both pristine and 3% Au-modified
hematite films from 400 to 750 nm irradiation. No peak shift in the
action spectra upon Au NP modification at 3% indicates no prominent
plasmonic contribution through water oxidation, although the photocurrent
suffers from stability issue particularly for Au modified film because
of the corrosion effect of Au. Figure 8 presents the bar graph plotted at different applied
potentials showing the comparison of dark and light currents for pristine
and Au-modified hematite. At −0.2 V versus Ag/AgCl, the net
photocurrent density of 3% Au–hematite is 0.046 mA cm–2, which is about four times higher than that of pristine hematite.
The net photocurrent density of 3% Au–hematite further increases
to 0.075 mA cm–2 at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, about 7-fold
enhancement compared to the pristine hematite at the same potential.
Moreover, the dark current of 5 and 10% Au–hematite samples
increase dramatically at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl, which corresponds to
the Au-oxidation peak as shown in Figure 8. It is apparent that the dark current increases
significantly with higher Au percentage at 0, 0.2, and 0.5 V versus
Ag/AgCl, which indicates the possible oxidation of Au NPs. Such photocurrent
responses further confirm the optimum 3% of Au modification for enhancing
the PEC activity of hematite. The discrepancy in the enhancement factors
from  SECM study and that of thin-film samples is attributed
to how these samples are dried from droplets versus quick-drying through
the spin coating and differences in the film thicknesses produced
from these two methods. Overall we can conclude that the decrease
of PEC performance above 3% Au is because of the increase in background
current of direct Au-oxidation which also serves as a charge recombination
center for photogenerated charges from hematite. Strong light absorption
by Au can also contribute to the decrease in PEC performance when
the hematite film is heavily loaded with Au.

2.5 Understanding
the Carrier Density, Flat Band
Potential, and Impedance of Au-Modified Hematite Photoanode
Capacitance measurements of pristine and Au-modified hematite thin-film
samples were performed and presented as Mott–Schottky (M–S)
plot (Figure 9). The
flat band potential Efb of hematite photoanode
in an electrochemical cell can be estimated by the intercept of the
M–S plot according to the following M–S equation65 1  where Csc is the
space charge capacitance; e is 1.602 × 10–19 C; ε is the dielectric constant of hematite;
ε0 is the permittivity of free space; ND is the carrier density; E is the applied
potential in V; kb is the Boltzmann constant,
and T represents the temperature in K. The slope
of the M–S plot can be used to calculate ND.

Figure 9 M–S plot of pristine and Au-modified hematite electrodes
recorded in 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte under dark conditions at an ac
frequency of 1 kHz.

Table 3 summarizes
the Efb and ND for pristine and Au-modified hematite under different percentage.
The flat band potential of the Au-modified hematite in 0.1 M NaOH
solution at an ac frequency of 1 kHz increases with Au percentage
and reaches −0.751 V versus Ag/AgCl, at 10% of Au, which is
about 0.2 V negative compared to that of pristine hematite. The donor
density estimated from the slope of the M–S plot is increased
significantly after Au modification and reaches about 3-fold at 10%
Au (1.64 × 1021 cm–3) as compared
to the pristine hematite (0.56 × 1021 cm–3). This suggests that the additional conductivity arises from the
Au-modified hematite.

Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were
performed for pristine and Au-modified hematite samples under dark
and standard 1 sun illumination conditions to obtain charge-transfer
information, as shown by the Nyquist plots in Figure 10. An equivalent circuit, which
consists of series resistance (RS), charge
transfer resistance (RCT), and space charge
capacitance (CS), was used to fit the
experimental EIS data.66Table 4 lists the EIS parameters obtained
from the fittings. The notations D and L represent the dark and light
conditions, respectively. The resistance of the electrolyte from
the working electrode to the reference electrode, which reflected
as RS, are similar for all the samples
(∼370 Ω). The RCT, which
dictates the photocurrent response of photocatalysts, is highly dependent
on the PEC efficiency of the electrode. As shown in Table 4, the RCT values are lower under light irradiation conditions compared
to the dark due to the photo-induced charge transfer. Furthermore,
charge transfer resistance decreases with the increase of Au percentage,
which indicates the increase of charge carriers in the film. Such
phenomenon facilitates the charge transfer of holes to the donor species
in the solution and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs, thus enhancing the photoactivity of hematite
film for water oxidation.

2.6 Surface Active Species Characterization of
Au Modified Hematite Photoanode
SI-SECM has been reported
to be a promising tool to investigate RSSs of a variety of electrocatalysts
and photocatalysts, such as hematite, W/Mo–BiVO4,67 TiO2,68 Ni,69 and MoS2.70 An ultramicroelectrode with sharp tip, instead
of optical fiber, is used as a second working electrode. RSSs produced
in the electrocatalytic or photocatalytic processes can be quantified
by a tip-generated titrant from a redox mediator in the electrolyte.
This technique demonstrates selectivity to surface species, the capability
to in-situ quantify for both surface coverage and reactivity of adsorbed
RSSs, and usefulness to obtain spatially and temporally-resolved information.71 Krumov et al.72 adopted
SI-SECM to study the RSSs formed on hematite during photocatalytic
water oxidation. The surface coverage of RSSs was found to be a function
of applied bias. SI-SECM measurements were conducted on the same SECM
equipment as SECM study. The schematic of SI-SECM setup is shown in Figure 11. Hematite and
the Au-modified hematite substrate were assembled in a home-made SECM
cell with 0.59 cm2 of surface area exposed to the electrolyte.
Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) was used as counter and a reference
electrode, respectively. A 10 μm (in diameter) Pt disk microelectrode
sealed in a glass capillary (Figure 11B,C) was used as the primary working electrode and
the photoactive substrates as the second working electrodes. All electrodes
were immersed in 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 9.4) containing 2 mM K3Fe(CN)6. The photoactive substrate was irradiated
by a halogen fiber illuminator at 1 sun irradiation. In the first
step of SI-SECM experiment, the substrate was irradiated by the lamp
under external bias to generate RSSs during water oxidation. The Pt
tip was disconnected in this step. The second step involved bias applied
on the Pt tip without bias potential and illumination at the substrate.
The Pt tip-generated [Fe(CN)6]4– in the
second step served as a titrant which quantitatively interrogated
the RSSs on a substrate (Figure 11D).

Figure 11 (A) Schematic of the SI-SECM setup. Side (B) and top (C)
view of
the Pt disk microelectrode. (D) Schematic showing the two steps involved
in the SI-SECM experiments.

After characterizing the photoactivity of pristine and Au-modified
hematite samples, we correlated the photoactivity with the surface-active
species by the SI-SECM technique. A chronoamperogram is presented
in Figure 12 to illustrate
the interrogation current under light illumination and the dark condition.
During the water oxidation reaction of the substrate, it is believed
that adsorbed OH• is generated.67 The OH• is able to oxidize Fe(CN)64– to Fe(CN)63–. This surface state generation is highly depended on the external
bias applied to the substrate.72 Thus,
an external bias of 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 V versus Ag/AgCl was applied
to the substrate with and without light illumination, and the reduction
current at the Pt tip was collected as a function of time thereafter.
The semilogarithmic plot of net interrogation currents is shown in Figure 12B,E for a series
of measurements with an increase in external bias applied for PEC
water oxidation. It is apparent to observe that the interrogation
current from the Pt tip increases as the substrate is pushing further
for water oxidation. In order to compare the surface interrogation
from pristine and 3% Au-modified hematite more clearly, bar graphs
were obtained showing the light and dark-generated surface coverage
of RSSs calculated by integrating the plots of interrogation current
versus time. The surface coverage of RSSs on both substrates increases
as the higher potential is applied, as well as the surface coverage
of net photogenerated RSSs. This trend is consistent with the increase
of net substrate current density obtained from CVs. It can be observed
that the surface coverage charge of pristine hematite increases from
15 nC (at 0.9 V) to 35 nC (at 1.2 V) under light illumination. For
the 3% Au-modified hematite sample, it increases from 20 nC (at 0.9
V) to 47 nC (at 1.2 V) under the same condition. However, the surface
coverage of charge under dark conditions increases more rapidly for
the Au-modified hematite than that of pristine hematite. The difference
of the surface charge under the dark condition is 10 nC from 0.9 to
1.2 V for pristine hematite, whereas it increased to 20 nC for the
Au-modified hematite under the same potential window. The rapid increase
of interrogation current under dark conditions caused the lower net
surface coverage for the Au-modified hematite sample. This also agrees
with the rapid increase of dark current under high external potential
applied during the PEC measurements.

current (B,E) and bar graph (C,F) showing the integrated surface charge
differences of pristine (top panel) and 3% Au-modified (bottom panel)
hematite samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the SECM technique can be used to efficiently screen
Au modification in the hematite photocatalyst for solar water splitting.
3% Au modification provides hematite the best PEC performance, which
increases with <3% Au modification but eventually decreases
when the Au percentage exceeds 3% due to the charge recombination.
SEM images and XPS analysis suggest that Au exists in the form of
NPs without changing the electronic structure of the hematite as they
are well distributed throughout the ∼100 nm-thick hematite
thin film. A 3% Au-modified hematite photoanode shows ∼6-fold
increase in its photocurrent density at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl (∼1.0
V vs RHE) with a desirable cathodic shift in the flat band potential
by 200 mV. With >5% Au modification, Au was oxidized at 0
V versus
Ag/AgCl, consequently reducing the photoactivity of the hematite film.
The M–S analysis revealed that Au-modification contributes
to the electronic conductivity of hematite film. EIS analysis suggests
significant improvement in the charge transfer resistance for Au-modified
samples. The SI-SECM measurements revealed that RSSs (OH•) generation is correlated to the external bias applied during water
oxidation. The dark interrogation current increased more rapidly for
Au-modified hematite samples, which agreed with the PEC measurements.
Hence, the overall enhancement in water splitting performance is attributed
to the electronic conductivity as a significant contributing factor
and improved charge separation by embedded Au NPs in the hematite.
The enhanced PEC performance cannot be justified by the change of
the absorption spectrum of the hematite upon Au modification. Therefore,
we conclude that there is no plasmonic effect in the present form
of Au modification with 20 nm NPs throughout the film to benefit the
light absorption of the hematite electrode by plasmon resonance. Au
corrosion and charge recombination may hinder the PEC performance
of hematite heavily modified with Au.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and EG (HOCH2CH2OH, 99+%) (Acros Organics), hydrogen tetrachloroaurate(III)
hydrate (HAuCl4, 99.9%-Au, Strem Chemicals), sodium hydroxide
(Ward’s Science) were used as received without further purification.
Deionized water with resistivity > 18 MΩ·cm was used
for
solution preparation. Titanium (0.05 cm thick, Colorado Concept Coatings)
and FTO (15–20 Ω·cm–1, Pilkington,
Toledo, OH) in 1 in × 1 in were used for both SECM studies and
preparing thin-film photoanodes for PEC measurements.

4.2 SECM Screening of the 10 × 10 Photocatalyst
Array Spots
A 10 × 10 array of Au-modified hematite
photocatalytic spots was prepared using a method described in our
previous work.13 Briefly, 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 and 0.01 M HAuCl4 solution was prepared
in EG and filtered using a 0.450 μm polytetrafluoroethylene
syringe filter before dispensing. A pico-liter dispenser (Austin,
TX) was used to dispense the 10 × 10 array spots on a pre-cleaned
Ti substrate with top and bottom three rows to be pristine Fe(NO3)3 and middle four rows to be Au mixed spots. The
concentration of Au was varied from 1 to 10 droplets for the four
rows in the middle to provide 1–10% of Au (atomic ratio) in
hematite. After obtaining the array, the dispensed droplets of individual
components (i.e., Fe, Au, and EG) were allowed to mix on a shaker
at 500 rpm for 30 min and then dried at 40 °C on a hot plate
for 2 h. Then the dried array sample was subsequently annealed in
air at 500 °C for 2 h, which was then converted to oxide. A CHI
920D scanning electrochemical microscope (CH Instruments, Inc., Austin,
TX) was used for PEC measurements of the array samples.13,14,44 A home-made Teflon electrochemical
cell was used for SECM measurement. The Ti substrate coated with hematite
array was attached to the bottom of the Teflon cell as a working electrode.
A Ag/AgCl reference electrode saturated with KCl and a Pt wire counter
electrodes were arranged inside the home-made cell to provide sufficient
space to accommodate the scanning optical fiber in X–Y directions. The photocatalytic activity
of the array of spots was tested under white light illumination via
the optical fiber, which moved in X–Y direction with the help of programmed piezo-positioner/controller.

A 0.1 M NaOH solution was used as an electrolyte. As the fiber
moves over to a photocatalytic spot, PEC reaction at the hematite
spot produces anodic photocurrent to be detected by the substrate
electrode. The cumulative current at every position of the array was
reconstructed to show as 3D photocurrent map to illustrate PEC activities
of the array.

4.3 Fabrication of Au-Modified
Hematite Thin-Film
Photoelectrode
Pristine and Au-modified hematite thin-film
electrodes were prepared using the spin-coating method. The spin coating
was conducted on a Laurell 650mz Spinner (Laurell Technologies). The
spin speeds were 400 rpm for 5 s followed by 2500 rpm for 30 s for
each layer. Each layer was dried at 60 °C on a hot plate before
coating the next layer. The 20 layers of pristine and Au-modified
hematite films were coated onto pre-cleaned FTO substrates to obtain
desired film thickness. The coated samples were then annealed at 500 °C
for 2 h at a heating rate of 2 °C/min from room temperature in
the air in a tube furnace. Hematite films modified with 0, 1, 3, 5,
and 10% (at. %) Au were prepared using the spin coating method and
were tested for PEC measurement.

4.4 Characterization
of Materials and Electrodes
The hematite electrodes were
characterized with a JEOL 700 scanning
electron microscope. The accelerating voltage for SEM was set to 20
kV. The UV–vis spectra were obtained using an HP 8452A diode
array UV–vis spectrophotometer, recording spectra over the
range 300–800 nm with a resolution of 2 nm. The chemical state
and surface composition of the freshly-synthesized pristine and Au-modified
iron oxide samples were examined by XPS on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD
spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source
(hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultra-high vacuum conditions
(at a base pressure of <8 × 10–10 Torr).
The survey spectra were obtained in the BE range of 1200–0
eV at room temperature with an analyzer pass energy of 160 eV and
an energy step size of 1 eV. High-resolution spectra were obtained
with a pass energy of 20 eV and a step size of 0.1 eV. XPS data analysis
was performed using the XPS Peak-fit program with Shirley background
subtraction and an iterative least-squares optimization algorithm.
The adventitious hydrocarbon peak (C 1s line at 284.8 eV) was used
as an internal standard to calibrate the binding energies of high-resolution
XPS spectra. Deconvolution of the C 1s and O 1s peaks was performed
according to their chemical environments. The relative sensitivity
factors (RSF) from Kratos library were used to obtain the relative
concentration of the following elements: Sn 3d (RSF = 7.875), Au 4f
(RSF = 6.25), Fe 3d (RSF = 2.957), O 1s (RSF = 0.78), and C 1s (RSF
= 0.278). All PEC measurements were performed by a CHI 760C bipotentiostat
(CH Instruments Inc., Austin, TX) in a three-electrode configuration.
A three-neck quartz photo-reactor with a planar window was used to
accommodate the thin-film-coated FTO working electrode, platinum wire
counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (saturated with KCl) reference electrode.
A standard simulated 1 sun (100 mW/cm2) irradiation was
provided by a solar simulator using a xenon lamp source (Oriel AM
1.5 filtered, Newport). The M–S measurement was carried out
in the dark at an ac frequency of 1 kHz by sweeping a dc potential
from −0.5 to 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl.
