The
glucose level is an important biological indicator for diabetes
diagnosis. In contrast with costly and unstable enzymatic glucose
sensing, oxide-based glucose sensors own the advantages of low fabrication
cost, outstanding catalytic ability, and high chemical stability.
Here, we fabricate a self-supporting spiky CuxO/Cu nanowire array structure by electrochemical cycling treatment.
The spiky CuxO/Cu nanowire is identified
to be a Cu core passivated by a conformal Cu2O layer with
extruded CuO petals, which provides abundant active sites for electrocatalytic
reaction in glucose detection. An interruptive potential sweeping
experiment is presented to elucidate the growth mechanism of the spiky
CuxO/Cu nanostructure during the potential
cycling treatment. The spiky CuxO/Cu nanowire
array electrode exhibits a sensitivity of 1210 ± 124 μA·mM–1·cm–2, a wide linear detection
range of 0.01–7 mM, and a short response time (<1 s) for
amperometric glucose sensing. The study demonstrates a route to modulate
oxide phase, crystal morphology, and electrocatalytic properties of
metal/oxide core–shell nanostructures.

Introduction
A timely and accurate
detection of glucose levels in biological
fluids is essential for diabetes care. Traditional glucose sensing
is based on the enzymatic functionalization of immobile glucose oxidase
(GOx) in a gel on an electrode.1 Although
enzymatic glucose sensors have been brought to practical medical diagnostic
applications, yet the stability and durability of GOx still remains
to be improved for enzymatic glucose sensing because they can be easily
affected by test environments such as temperature, pH value, oxygen
content, and humidity.2,3 Recently, a non-enzymatic glucose
sensing based on the electrocatalytic oxidation of glucose on noble
metals,4−8 metal oxides,9−14 complexes,15,16 and carbon materials17,18 has been actively researched to resolve the reliability and durability
problems encountered for enzymatic glucose sensing. Among these non-enzymatic
glucose sensing materials, semiconductive metal oxides appear to be
highly attractive by considering the fabrication cost, synthesis complexity,
biocompatibility, chemical stability, and electrocatalytic performance.19

Copper oxide is a promising glucose sensing
material because of
the advantages of natural abundance, low cost, nontoxicity, and excellent
electrocatalytic properties. A tremendous research effort has been
dedicated to the development of enzyme-free glucose sensors based
on Cu oxides.18,20 Generally, Cu oxides in the form
of nanoparticles (NPs) or nanowires (NWs) are preferred forms because
their catalytic efficiency and charge transfer capability are greatly
enhanced due to the presence of plentiful active sites on the surface
of NPs and NWs. To form a functional sensing electrode, Cu oxide NPs
or NWs synthesized from solutions must be transferred onto a conducting
substrate such as a glassy carbon electrode (GCE).21 However, the charge transport from oxide to the conducting
electrode may be hindered by huge contact resistance between the NPs
or NWs. Zhang et al. prepared a glucose sensor with CuO NPs/GCE configuration,
showing a high sensitivity of 2555 μA·mM–1·cm–2 and a low detection limit of 72 nM but
a narrow linear detection range of 0.1–3 mM.21 Moreover, Cu NWs with extruded Cu2O nanosheets
have been synthesized and implemented onto a GCE, showing a glucose
sensing performance of 1420 μA·mM–1·cm–2 in sensitivity, 40 nM in detection limit, and 0.7–2.0
mM in the linear detection range.22 The
main issue associated with the NPs/GCE or NWs/GCE type glucose sensors
is the narrow linear range that is likely attributed to the resistive
transport path of charge carriers from Cu oxide NPs (NWs) to the electrode.
Li et al. have electrodeposited Cu NPs on a Cu foil directly, followed
by an appropriate anodic oxidation treatment, to form a CuxO/Cu glucose sensor, showing a wide linear detection
range up to 6 mM.20 In summary, a direct
growth of nanostructured Cu oxide on a conducting electrode shall
be able to provide the best overall glucose detection performance.

A cyclic voltammetric deposition technique, also known as the potential
cycling method, has been used to grow various metal oxides including
ruthenium oxide and manganese oxide by controlling composition and
pH value of electrolyte and potential sweeping range and cycles.23,24 In this study, a spiky CuxO/Cu NW array
structure was grown on a Ni thin film electrode through template-assisted
electrodeposition followed by potential cycling treatment, as shown
in Scheme 1. The oxide
phase and crystal structure of the CuxO/Cu NWs were characterized. The growth mechanism of the spiky CuxO/Cu nanostructure during the potential cycling
treatment is elucidated based on the ex situ microstructure characterization
in an interruptive potential sweeping experiment. Finally, the glucose
sensing performance of the spiky CuxO/Cu
NW array was evaluated by amperometric measurement.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of the Spiky CuxO/Cu NW
Array
An array of Cu NWs grown on a Ni thin film was released
from the anodic alumina oxide (AAO) template and consequently treated
in an alkaline solution by sweeping the potential back and forth in
a three-electrode cell. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
show that the as-released Cu NWs exhibit a smooth surface (Figure 1a,c) and transform
into a spiky morphology after the potential cycling treatment (Figure 1b,d). An X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis indicates that only cuprous oxide (Cu2O)
is present in the as-released Cu NWs, whereas both Cu2O
and cupric oxide (CuO) appear on the post-treated Cu NWs (Figure 1e). Furthermore,
an enlarged transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image reveals that
the Cu NW indeed is passivated by a conformal Cu2O layer
with some CuO “petals” extruding out of the Cu2O layer (Figure 2a).
The Cu/Cu2O/CuO composite nanostructure was further confirmed
by the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images and their corresponding
fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffraction patterns (Figure 2b–d).

and (b,d) Cu NWs with potential cycling treatment. (e) XRD patterns

NW showing a Cu core passivated by a conformal Cu2O layer

and (d) CuO (orange square).

Now, one question may be raised whether the unique spiky
CuO/Cu2O/Cu nanostructure is specifically associated with
the electrochemical
potential cycling treatment. It has been attempted to grow CuO on
the Cu NWs in the same alkaline electrolyte by applying a constant
oxidation potential of +0.6 V (vs SCE) with the same duration as the
potential cycling treatment. Interestingly, the Cu NWs only formed
a thick and rough Cu2O layer rather than the spiky CuO
according to the XRD and TEM analyses (Figure 3). A static anodic oxidation environment
is apparently unable to grow spiky CuO on the Cu NWs. Thus, an in-depth
understanding of the growth mechanism of spiky CuO during the potential
cycling treatment becomes the subject of interest.

oxidation treatment; (b) HRTEM image of Cu2O obtained from

Cu NW arrays.

Growth Mechanism of Spiky
CuxO/Cu
NWs
The spiky CuxO/Cu NW array
was obtained by sweeping the potential with respect to the saturated
calomel electrode (SCE) from +0.6 to −0.7 V and back to +0.6
V several times at a scan rate of 2.5 mV/s in a 0.1 M NaOH solution.
Each cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve behaves differently with potential
sweeping cycles (Figure 4). Considering the sweeping potential in between −0.2 and
+0.6 V of the oxidation half-cycle (upper part), the current peak
is most significant in the first CV cycle, then becomes two individual
small peaks in the second CV cycle, and finally decreases down to
a negligible level in the following CV cycles. It implies that the
growth of CuO phase mainly occurs in the first CV cycle, becomes less
significant in the second cycle, and is almost negligible in the following
cycles.

Figure 4 CV curves of the Cu NW array measured by sweeping the potential
with respect to the SCE from +0.6 to −0.7 V and back to +0.6
V five times at a scan rate of 2.5 mV/s in a 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte.

Here, an ex situ experiment was
performed by interrupting the potential
sweeping process at different stages of the first CV cycle to clarify
the microstructural evolution of the Cu NWs during the potential cycling
process (Figure 5a).
First, by sweeping the potential from +0.6 to 0 V in the reduction
half-cycle (Segment I), a large oxidation current was developed and
decreased to a negligible level rapidly. Some tiny CuO particles formed
on the Cu NW surface as shown in the TEM image (Figure 5b). Second, by sweeping the potential from
+0.6 to −0.7 V directly in the reduction half-cycle (Segment
I + II), there is a clear reduction of current peak in between −0.4
to −0.6 V. A TEM analysis indicates that Cu2O becomes
the major oxide phase in the electrochemically treated Cu NW (Figure 5c). The Cu2O phase is mainly ascribed to the reduction of CuO NPs formed in
the previous stage because the sweeping potential covers the Cu(II)
→ Cu(I) reduction peak at −0.55 V. Consequently, by
sweeping the potential from +0.6 to −0.7 V and back to −0.4
V (Segment I + II + III), the Cu2O/Cu NWs showed no significant
change in morphology and oxide phase (Figure 5d). Although the sweeping potential covers
the Cu → Cu(I) transformation at–0.5 V in the oxidation
half-cycle, the oxidation peak in the CV curve is barely detectable
(Figure 5a) and no
gross oxide formation is observed in this stage. Finally, when the
Cu NWs were treated with a complete CV cycle (Segment I + II + II
+ IV), they evolved into spiky Cu/CuxO
NWs (Figure 5e). It
is noted that a large current peak in the potential between −0.2
and +0.3 V of the oxidation half-cycle may reflect a gross formation
of Cu oxide associated with the Cu(I) → Cu(II) and Cu →
Cu(II) transformations. The Cu(I) → Cu(II) transformation may
involve two possible oxidation reactions, as given below. 1   2  

Figure 5 (a)
Potential sweeping process interrupted at different stages
of the first CV cycle. Low-magnification TEM images of the CuxO/Cu NW and HRTEM images of Cu oxide in red
square (insets) after the sweeping process along (b) Segment I, (c)
Segment I + II, (d) Segment I + II + III, and (e) Segment I + II +
III + IV.

The above two reactions reveal
that Cu2O can be oxidized
to form Cu(OH)2 or CuO when the sweeping potential is in
between −0.2 and 0 V.

Although Cu(OH)2 formation
is the dominant reaction
in the electrochemical cell,25,26 the Cu(OH)2 can further transform into CuO in a basic solution through the dehydration
reaction with an intermediate of Cu(OH)42–.27 Therefore, the previously formed Cu2O extrusions would transform into CuO in this stage. When
the potential was swept further to the range of +0.1 to +0.3 V, the
Cu → Cu(II) transformation becomes active and favors the formation
of copper hydroxide from elemental Cu. 3  

In this reaction, Cu atoms are first ionized into Cu2+ ions under the applied potential. The Cu2+ ions would
diffuse through the previously formed Cu2O layer and react
with OH– ions to sustain the growth of Cu(OH)2. Actually, the Cu2+ ionized at the inner Cu tend
to out-diffuse along some fast paths such as grain boundaries and
surface of the extruded Cu2O. Assuming the diffusion of
Cu2+ ions as the rate-limiting step, dendritic Cu(OH)2 is expected to form because the replenishment flux of Cu2+ ions varies from site to site on the CuxO/Cu NW. Finally, the dendritic Cu(OH)2 would transform
into spiky CuO after the dehydration reaction. The morphological evolution
of Cu NWs during the potential cycling is depicted in Scheme 2.

NW to a Flowerlike Cu/Cu2O/CuO Structure
Effects of Potential Scan Rate and NaOH Concentration
on the
CuxO/Cu NW Morphology
Although
both CuO and Cu(OH)2 belong to Cu(II) species, they do
exhibit distinct crystal morphology and color. The Cu(OH)2 phase appears to be blue, while the CuO looks black (Figure S1). The relative portion of these two
Cu(II) species in the CuxO/Cu NW array
can be modulated by changing the scan rate of potential cycling treatment
and NaOH concentration in the electrolyte. Figure 6 shows the SEM images of the CuxO/Cu NWs treated in a 0.1 M NaOH solution after three
potential cycling with different scan rates (2.5–100 mV/s).
It is found that the specimens with high scan rates (>5 mV/s) show
many needlelike crystallites among the CuxO/Cu NWs without spiky morphology. The needlelike crystallites were
identified to be the Cu(OH)2 phase according to the TEM
analysis (Figure S2). As we mentioned earlier,
Cu(OH)2 is a precursor for CuO formation during the potential
cycling treatment. Under a high scan rate, newly formed Cu(OH)2 cannot be completely transformed into CuO due to the slow
dehydration reaction. Instead, some Cu(OH)2 would grow
into needlelike crystallites. Thus, the spiky CuO only grows at a
slow scan rate during potential cycling. The growth kinetics of Cu(OH)2 can also be tailored by varying the NaOH concentration in
the electrolyte.

NWs treated
in a 0.1 M NaOH solution after three potential cycling with different
scan rates: (a) 100, (b) 50, (c) 5, and (d) 2.5 mV/s.

Figure 7 shows the
SEM images of the CuxO/Cu NWs treated
in a solution of different NaOH concentrations (0.001–2 M)
after three potential cycling at a scan rate of 2.5 mV/s. It is found
that the thin CuO petals transform into thick CuO plates around the
CuxO/Cu NWs with increasing NaOH concentration
in the electrolyte. It is noted that no spiky CuO was developed in
the CuxO/Cu NWs prepared in 0.001 M NaOH
electrolyte (Figure 7a) due to the suppressed Cu(OH)2 formation under an extremely
low NaOH concentration. The enhanced growth of Cu(OH)2 in
an electrolyte of high NaOH concentration gives rise to thick Cu(OH)2 dendrites that turn into coarse CuO plates after the dehydration
reaction (Figure 7b–f).
It is worth mentioning that the gross growth of Cu(OH)2 or CuO may also cause the cavitation of Cu NWs due to the Kirkendall
effect.28 The electrochemical process condition
must be carefully controlled to achieve the desired morphology and
structural integrity of the spiky CuxO/Cu
NWs.

and (f) 2 M NaOH after three potential cycling at a scan rate of 2.5
mV/s.

Glucose Sensing Performance
of the Spiky CuxO/Cu NW Array Electrode
The self-supporting CuxO/Cu NW array
electrode is subject to amperometric
measurement for glucose sensing performance evaluation. All the samples
were prepared by three potential cycling between +0.6 and −0.7
V at a scan rate of 2.5 mV/s in a 0.1 M NaOH solution. Prior to the
glucose response measurements, a CV measurement was performed on the
samples in the 0.1 M NaOH electrolyte with different glucose concentrations
of 0, 1, 2, and 5 mM (Figure 8a). The oxidation current in the potential range of +0.2 to
+0.6 V increases with the glucose concentration. The increase of the
oxidation current is mainly ascribed to the transformation of CuO
to CuOOH or Cu(OH)4– on the CuO surface,
as shown below.2 4   5

CuxO/Cu NW array

measured current density versus the added glucose concentration for
the CuxO/Cu NW array electrode (the inset
shows the amperometric response at lower glucose concentrations).

Because the Cu(III) species, CuOOH
and Cu(OH)4–, tend to oxidize glucose
into gluconolactone in the solution, the
measured current is expected to increase with the amount of glucose
molecules on the surface of the CuxO/Cu
NW array electrode. The amperometric measurement was performed at
a fixed potential of +0.6 V with recurrent glucose addition. Prior
to the determination of glucose sensing sensitivity, an interference
test has been performed to confirm the specificity of the spiky CuxO/Cu NW array electrode to glucose. Several
potential interference species were sequentially added during the
amperometric measurements. The concentrations of interference species
were selected based on their nominal values in human blood. The normal
physiological level of glucose is about 3–7 mM in human blood.
The concentrations of chloride ions, ascorbic acid (AA), dopamine
(DA), and uric acid (UA) are approximately in the range of 1/10–1/20
of the blood glucose concentration.29 By
adding 1 mM NaCl and 0.1 mM of UA, AA and DA into the solution sequentially,
the current responses to these interference species were barely detectable
as compared with that of 1 mM glucose (Figure 8b). Moreover, we also found that the glucose
detection limit for the spiky CuxO/Cu
NW array electrode is around 10 μM (Figure 8c). By plotting the measured current density
versus the added glucose concentration, we can determine the sensitivity
of the CuxO/Cu NW array electrode to be
around 1300 μA·mM–1·cm–2. If we took the sample-to-sample variation into account, the sensitivity
averaged from five different samples is around 1210 ± 124 μA·mM–1·cm–2 (Figure 8d). All the samples exhibit a wide linear
range of 0.01–7 mM and a short response time (<1 s).

Table 1 lists the
summarized glucose sensing performance of various copper oxide electrodes
reported in the literature.12,20,22,30−35 It is worth mentioning that the CuxO/Cu
NW array electrode in this work may not have the highest sensitivity
and the lowest detection limit compared to other works published in
the literature.34−36 However, the glucose sensor developed in this study
indeed shows a widest linear detection range together with a competitively
high sensitivity and a low detection limit. Moreover, the chemical
stability of the spiky CuxO/Cu NW array
electrode is also evaluated after 6 months of storage time. The amperometric
responses to glucose addition were measured for the as-fabricated
CuxO/Cu NW array electrode and the same
sample after keeping in ambient air for 6 months (Figure 9). The CuxO/Cu NW array electrode shows no significant changes in glucose
sensing performance and morphology (Figure S3) after long storage in ambient air. The results suggest that the
spiky CuxO/Cu nanostructure prepared by
the potential cycling treatment not only preserves decent glucose
sensing properties but also excellent chemical stability.

One of the intriguing
findings for the spiky CuxO/Cu NW array
is its superior chemical stability, which is
likely associated with the conformal Cu2O layer in the
Cu/Cu2O/CuO composite nanostructure. We have shown that
the Cu2O layer grown on Cu NWs with high-density nanoscale
twin boundaries can maintain its structural integrity in ambient air
for more than 1 year.37 The twin-modified
surface enables the epitaxial growth of Cu2O layer on nanotwinned
Cu NWs (same in this study). The epitaxial Cu2O layer will
suppress the out-diffusion of Cu cations and prevent continued Cu-oxidation
due to lack of fast diffusion paths. Here, the spiky CuO/Cu2O/Cu composite nanostructure was obtained by the potential cycling
method. The spiky CuO phase was mainly formed in the first two CV
cycles (Figure 4).
No significant redox peaks and morphological changes were observed
for the spiky CuO/Cu2O/Cu nanostructure after two cycles
of potential sweeping (Figure 4). It accounts for why the spiky CuxO/Cu NW array electrode is so stable over a long storage period.

Conclusions
A spiky CuxO/Cu
NW array structure
prepared by the potential cycling treatment is characterized and evaluated
for glucose sensing applications. The growth mechanism of spiky CuxO/Cu NW during the cyclic potential sweeping
process is investigated. A careful microstructure examination indicates
the Cu/CuxO NW to be a Cu/Cu2O core–shell structure covered by plentiful CuO petals. The
spiky CuO preserves abundant active sites to react with glucose molecules,
while the metallic Cu core provides a highly conductive path for electrical
charges collected during the electrocatalytic oxidation reaction of
glucose. The spiky CuxO/Cu NW array electrode
demonstrates balanced and competitive glucose sensing performance
with a sensitivity of 1210 ± 124 μA·mM–1·cm–2 and a linear detection range of 0.01–7
mM. This study paves a way to produce chemically stable and functional
nanostructured Cu oxide through a simple and fast potential cycling
method.

Experimental Section
Preparation of the CuxO/Cu NW Array
Copper NWs were deposited into a porous
AAO template (60–80
nm in pore size) by pulse-current electrodeposition, which had a Ni
layer evaporated at one side to serve as a contact electrode.38 After dissolving the AAO in a NaOH solution,
the released Cu NW array evolved into a bush of spiky CuxO/Cu NWs through a potential cycling treatment using
an electrochemical working station (CHI602E, CH Instruments). In a
standard three-electrode cell, the Cu NW array was connected to the
working electrode in conjunction with a Pt counter electrode and a
reference SCE. The Cu oxide was grown on the Cu NWs by sweeping the
working electrode potential with respect to the SCE from +0.6 to −0.7
V and back to +0.6 V repeatedly at different scan rates and NaOH concentrations
in electrolyte.

Microstructure Characterization
X-ray diffractometry
(XRD, D2 Phaser, Bruker) was used to analyze the oxide phase and crystal
structure of the CuxO/Cu NWs. The sample
was glued on a glass substrate for Bragg–Brentano XRD measurements
with 2θ angle ranging from 15° to 75°. The morphology
and dimension of CuxO/Cu NWs were examined
by a field-emission SEM system (SU-8010, Hitachi). Finally, a TEM
(JEM-ARM200FTH, JEOL) analysis was performed to reveal the microstructural
information of CuxO/Cu NWs. Samples for
TEM observation were prepared by separating the CuxO/Cu NWs from the array electrode through ultrasonic vibration
in ethanol solution and dispersing the suspension onto a Mo-grid TEM
holder (Formvar/Carbon 200 mesh, Ted Pella).

Evaluation of Glucose Sensing
Performance
An amperometric
measurement was performed by recording the electric current at a fixed
potential with consecutive addition of desired amount of glucose solution.
The electrolyte used for glucose detection evaluation is 40 mL of
0.1 M NaOH solution with magnetic stirring at a rate of 100 rpm. The
electric current was recorded with consecutive glucose addition under
a constant potential of +0.6 V (vs SCE) applied on the CuxO/Cu NW array electrode. The measured current shows
a stepwise rising profile with time due to the recurrent addition
of glucose. The sensitivity and linear range of glucose sensing were
obtained from the plot of current density versus glucose concentration.
The detection limit and selectivity of glucose sensing were, respectively,
determined from the amperometric response to the addition of minimum
glucose amount and appropriate dosage of interference species into
the solution.
