The analytical study
of historical collagen-based materials such
as leather book covers is a complex task for conservation scientists.
Historical leather presents a heterogeneous composition of both organic
and inorganic materials that show an evident reactivity, particularly
when exposed to specific environments. Its correct preservation in
archival documents remains challenging as some aspects of its chemical
composition, degradation, and effectiveness of conservation treatments
are still not fully understood. Here, we describe a novel application
of attenuated total reflection (ATR)–Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopic imaging coupled with a macro ATR accessory to study
historical leather book covers. This nondestructive and high spatial
resolution approach has allowed the visualization of degradation phenomena
affecting this fragile material, particularly the gelatinization of
collagen and, for the first time, the detection of the formation of
calcium stearate (metal carboxylates or soaps). In addition, the distribution
of modified soybean oil used as a treatment to maintain properties
such as elasticity and hydrophobicity of the leather was studied.
The effect of anomalous dispersion on the strong IR bands obtained
in the ATR mode and the resulting changes to the band positions are
also discussed. This research addresses issues that are relevant to
the conservation of archival materials of cultural heritage for future
generations.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
correct conservation of historical archival materials and documents
is vital not only for their artistic value, but also because they
represent physical records of human history. Leather, a collagen-based
material combined with various organic and inorganic compounds, is
frequently found as part of these documents. Since antiquity, leather
has been a preferred material for bookbinding.1 Generally made from mammal skins, the manufacture took several
months to years, significantly differing depending on geographical
and historical factors and the quality of the final product required.
The manufacturing process has been extensively described elsewhere.2 In brief, the animal skin was first soaked in
an alkali bath with added lime and then scraped with a knife to remove
the epidermis layer, hair, and fat to reach the corium layer of the
skin. The carbonatation of calcium hydroxide residues from the liming
bath with the CO2 present in the atmosphere causes the
precipitation of calcium carbonate commonly found in leather. Successively,
the skins were tanned. Vegetable tannins derived from plants were
first used before metal tanning agents were introduced in the second
half of the 19th century. Tannins prevent the decay of the skin by
cross-linking the collagen fibers transforming the skin into durable
leather.3 The tanning also gives the leather
its color from light brown-red to darker shades. When considered ready,
after been washed and dried, the leather surface was treated with
additional materials. Compounds, such as oils and waxes, were applied
to give the leather specific physical/mechanical properties (i.e.,
flexibility and impermeability) and mixed with colorants and pigments
for decorative purposes.4

Leather
artifacts are prone to alteration and degradation because
of their heterogeneous composition and sensitivity to environmental
factors (humidity, temperature, and pollutants).5−9 The decay of leather can ultimately end in the disintegration
of the material and damage the documents. Different approaches are
currently applied in the conservation of leather book covers. These
approaches can comprise a regulation of the environment where the
archival material is stored to create the most suitable conditions
for a long-term conservation. In other cases, the level of decay of
the leather requires a “physical” intervention, such
as the use of oil emulsions to restore mechanical properties lost.
The analytical characterization of the leather composition, alteration,
and conservation state is a vital step to understand the best procedure
to apply.

IR spectroscopy techniques are very suitable for investigating
collagen-based historical materials, and they have been successfully
used for studying leather wall covers in historical buildings,10 for identifying tannins in leather,11 and characterizing the composition and degradation
of parchment, also made from animal skins.12−14 Recently, Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy has been coupled with a focal
plane array (FPA) detector, allowing thousands of FTIR spectra to
be simultaneously collected in a short time. By plotting the integrated
absorbance of the spectral bands as a function of all pixels, spectroscopic
images representing the distribution in a micrometer scale of the
components detected are obtained.15 Compared
to transmission, the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode requires
little sample preparation as the effective pathlength of the IR light
in the sample is not limited by its thickness, potentially allowing
the sample to be analyzed in a nondestructive way. ATR–FTIR
spectroscopy is a flexible approach to collect spectra in the mid-IR
region. Portable instruments for ATR–FTIR spectroscopy are
available and used to analyze artifacts in situ. Sufficient contact
between the sample/object studied and the ATR crystal is necessary.
Therefore, it is important to proceed with an appropriate care in
this step in order not to damage the sample/object. This can be achieved
by considering the shape and dimensions of the ATR crystals and the
physical characteristics of the material to be analyzed. Depending
on the accessory used, macro ATR–FTIR spectroscopic imaging
can be applied to large objects (if they can be moved to the lab)
without the need of complex sample preparation. We have previously
reported that micro and macro ATR–FTIR spectroscopic imaging
is a powerful analytical technique for conservation science.16−18 However, there are no studies reporting its application to leather
book covers.

In this work, an FTIR spectroscopic imaging apparatus
coupled with
a single reflection diamond ATR accessory for the macro mode is used
to study samples from original book covers dated between the 16th
and the 19th century from the collection of the Mesrop Mashtots Institute
of Ancient Manuscripts, the Matenadaran, Yerevan, Armenia. The Matenadaran
is one of the oldest and most precious depositories of ancient manuscripts
in the world. The scope of this work is to help gain a deeper knowledge
regarding the composition of historical leather in archival material
by examining the distribution of the IR bands detected and linking
it to the original materials, possible degradation products, and an
oil emulsion used to treat the book covers. Different materials derived
from manufacturing or used in later interventions can interact between
them to form potentially dangerous products for the preservation of
leather book covers. A striking example is the formation of calcium
carboxylates (metal soaps) that has not been deeply investigated yet.
Additionally, the protein collagen constituting the skin fibers is
susceptible to oxidation, partial hydrolysis, biological attack, and
acidification (red-rot), and it can undergo denaturation as early
as during the manufacturing process.19 When denaturation occurs, the native polypeptide chain, organized
in a left-handed triple α helix, unfolds into a random coil
structure. This leads to the formation of gelatin, a water-soluble
degradation product found in collagen archival materials. The preservation
state of collagen in leather and parchment and the presence of gelatin
can be evaluated by investigating the amide I and II spectral bands.
These two bands, found in the 1800–1500 cm–1 spectral region, are complex IR bands, and their shape and position
are particularly informative as they correlate to the secondary structure
of collagen and its interaction with the environment.20−22

Finally, when interpreting FTIR spectra measured in the ATR
mode,
to avoid misinterpretations, it is essential to consider the presence
of anomalous dispersion, a distortion that can affect particularly
strong spectral bands of materials with a high refractive index (n). Particularly with a diamond ATR crystal (n ≈ 2.4), significant red shifts with respect to the band positions
in spectra collected in transmission mode can occur.23 These band shifts are usually stronger when a diamond crystal
instead of a crystal with a higher refractive index (i.e. germanium, n ≈ 4) is used as the difference between the refractive
indices of the diamond and the sample is smaller. Hence, materials
relevant to this work were measured with the same setup to evaluate
the effect of using a diamond ATR crystal on their band positions
and to correctly assign the bands found in the spectra of the leather
samples analyzed.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Macro ATR–FTIR Spectroscopic Imaging
An imaging
Golden Gate ATR accessory (Specac, UK) hosted in a IMAC
macrochamber attached to a Tensor FTIR spectrometer (Bruker Optics)
and equipped with an FPA detector (Santa Barbara Focalplane, USA)
was used for macro-ATR–FTIR spectroscopic imaging. The ATR
accessory has specifically designed correcting lenses and a prism-shaped
diamond ATR crystal with a contact surface of 2 × 2 mm2 (n ≈ 2.4, angle of incidence ≈ 44°).
The samples were simply put into contact with the ATR crystal by gently
pressing with a stainless steel flat anvil of the ATR accessory. An
array of 64 × 64 pixels of the FPA detector was selected and
4096 FTIR spectra simultaneously collected. This setup provides an
image size of ∼600 × 550 μm with a spatial resolution
of 15–20 μm. A total of 128 or 256 scans were co-added
with 8 cm–1 spectral resolution in the range of
3800–850 cm–1. The data were treated with
the commercial software OPUS (Bruker). Spectroscopic images are obtained
by plotting the distribution of the integrated absorbance of selected
spectral bands. A false color scale represents how strong the absorbance
is, where magenta stands for highest and blue for lowest absorbance.
The spectra presented throughout this paper are extracted from a single
pixel in measured spectroscopic images.

The open source software
ImageJ was used to assign specific colors to the components of interest,
the distribution of which was plotted in the FTIR spectroscopic images.
First, from the FTIR images, single-color images representing the
distribution of each component were obtained. Then, selected single-color
images of the relevant components were recombined into a composite
image. This helped to better visualize the localization and overlapping
of the compounds detected in the same area.

2.2 ATR–FTIR
Spectroscopy
Conventional
FTIR spectra were recorded in the ATR mode with a portable spectrometer
(Alpha-P, Bruker Optics) fitted with a single-reflection diamond crystal
and a single-element detector.

2.3 Materials
Pure precipitated calcium
carbonate (Sigma) and a pork gelatin sheet (AB World Foods) were used
and measured with the macro ATR–FTIR spectroscopic imaging
setup to evaluate the effect of anomalous dispersion on the strong
IR bands.

The leather samples from historical book covers dated
from the 17th to the 19th century (Table 1) are part of the collection of the Matenadaran
Institute, Armenia. These leather book covers, from which the samples
were taken, were removed from manuscripts in the past (the date of
removal is unknown) as damaged or degraded. The removed covers were
kept in the depository of the Matenadaran Institute. The dating of
the covers was done based on hand-written dates noted on the back
of the covers. These notes were probably made by an archivist of the
institute in the past. The dates reported are consistent with the
composition and manufacturing type of the covers, supporting the dating.
The samples were taken with scissors from the covers under a microscope
to check the absence of biodegradation.

Three samples were treated
with soybean oil emulsified in a concentrated
H2SO4 solution (in a ratio of 10% by weight
of the soybean oil) and applied by a brush. This treatment, developed
at the Matenadaran, aims to remove the humidity adsorbed by the collagen
fibers and provide elasticity and softness to the covers. These historical
cover samples were suitable for testing the feasibility of our approach
in detecting the modified soybean oil treatment on leather covers.
Except for the cover of the Bible printed in Amsterdam, the rest of
the covers were most probably produced in Eastern Europe and Middle
East.

3 Results and Discussion
All untreated
leather samples presented at a visual examination
a flaked surface with a network of cracks on both sides, probably
caused by a loss of elasticity (visible images of the samples are
reported in the Supporting Information,
Figure S1).

Two main aspects were considered when studying the
amide I and
II bands of the FTIR spectra of the leather samples: the transformation
of collagen in gelatin and the effect of anomalous dispersion on these
two spectral bands. In the leather samples analyzed in this work,
the amide I band was detected in the region from 1645 to 1623 cm–1. However, the amide I band has previously been reported
at about 1658 cm–1 for native collagen, 1651 cm–1 for denatured collagen,20 and at 1633 cm–1 for gelatin.21,22 The significant shift of 10–15 cm–1 for
this spectral band, compared to literature values, may originate from
anomalous dispersion when a diamond ATR crystal is used.23 A dry pork gelatin sheet (AB World Foods) measured
with the same setup showed the amide I band at 1626 cm–1 (Supporting Information, Figure S2),
thus confirming the effect of using a diamond crystal. The amide I
band in the region 1645–1638 cm–1 was then
assigned to the preserved collagen; when detected between 1637 and
1630 cm–1, it was attributed to the unfolding of
the helices and, when below 1630 cm–1, it was assigned
to gelatin. When gelatin was evident in the spectra, a shoulder at
about 1655 cm–1 appeared, possibly resulting from
remaining α-helix chains. As shown in Figure 1 for the top surface of a leather cover of
a manuscript dated 1750, spectroscopic images can be obtained by plotting
the absorbance of a delimitated area of the amide I band assigned
to collagen (spectral range 1710–1635 cm–1) and to gelatin (spectral range 1634–1600 cm–1). Therefore, the extension of the gelatinization affecting the surface
of the leather samples can be revealed. In this case, the amide II
band in the gelatin spectrum appeared upshifted, possibly as a consequence
of hydration.21 This was also visible in
the FTIR spectra of pork gelatin where the amide II band shifted from
1536 to 1540 cm–1 after it was briefly soaked in
water (Figure S2).

spectra of the amide I and II bands extracted from the chemical images
(black arrows). Amide I and II bands appear at 1640 and 1539 cm–1, respectively (red line), for collagen and at 1625
and 1547 cm–1, respectively, for gelatin (blue line),
possibly as the result of hydration. A shoulder at ∼1655 cm–1 in the gelatin spectrum is assigned to the remaining
α-helix chains. The red and blue areas represent the integrated
regions of the amide I band selected for plotting the (b) spectroscopic
images showing the distribution of collagen and gelatin. The image

Figure 2 FTIR spectrum (black line) in the 1800–1250 cm–1 region extracted from the macro ATR–FTIR image
of the external
surface of a leather cover sample from the Bible printed in Amsterdam,
dated 1666, and its second derivative (gray line). The overlapping
spectral bands were assigned to the following: collagen/gelatin amide
I (1655 and 1623 cm–1) and amide II (1535 cm–1), vegetable hydrolysable tannins (1705, 1336, and
1310 cm–1), and a lipid component (1734 and 1462
cm–1). The spectral bands assigned to tannins of
vegetable origin, common for both condensed and hydrolysable tannins,
are visible at about 1605, 1508, and 1444 (ν C=C aromatic
ring) cm–1. The distinctive bands of hydrolysable
tannins are present at 1705, 1336, and ∼1310 cm–1.

As the amide I and II bands overlapped
with the bands of other
components present, such as lipids and tannins, the second derivative
of selected spectra extracted was calculated, as shown for the leather
sample of a Bible printed in Amsterdam, dated 1666 (Figure 2). This method helped to discern
the peak positions of the overlapping IR bands of lipids, collagen/gelatin,
and tannins in the spectral range 1800–1200 cm–1.

In the FTIR spectra of the leather samples, the spectral
bands
assigned to tannins of vegetable origin were found at about 3310 (ν
OH), 1605 and 1508 (ν C=C aromatic ring), and 1180 (ν
COH) cm–1. These bands are common for both condensed
and hydrolysable tannins. However, hydrolysable tannins show distinctive
IR bands in the region 1710–1700 cm–1, arising
from the stretching of the phenolic ester groups, and at about 1325
and 1310 cm–1 assigned to the δ OH and the
νs C–O–C, respectively.11,24 In the spectra presented in Figure 2 of the leather cover from the Bible printed in Amsterdam,
dated 1666, these bands are visible at 1705, 1336, and ∼1310
cm–1 along with the other bands typical of vegetable
tannins.

Calcium carbonate is commonly found in historical leather
resulting
from the carbonatation of calcium hydroxide residues of the liming
bath with the CO2 present in the atmosphere or added during
manufacturing. In the leather samples analyzed, the anti-symmetric
stretching (νas) mode of CO3 groups appeared
in the region 1416–1405 cm–1 (Figure 3b), along with a second sharp
band at about 875 cm–1 (δ CO3).
In the literature, this band is reported at 1435–1420 cm–1 in the transmission mode.25 The position of the νas CO3 band could
have indicated that other carbonate species were present, uncommon
for the leather covers analyzed. Furthermore, the position of this
band appeared correlated to the absorbance: as the absorbance increased,
the band shift appeared stronger, a consequence of the anomalous dispersion
effect. ATR–FTIR spectra of pure CaCO3 powder (Sigma)
collected with the same setup confirmed that the νas CO3 band shifted from 1413 to 1396 cm–1 as the absorbance increased (Supporting Information, Figure S3).

Figure 3 Macro ATR–FTIR images and spectra of the external
surface
of two leather cover samples (Matenadaran) reveal the correlated distribution
of CaCO3, gypsum, and Ca stearate (soap). (a) Leather cover,
17th century manuscript: visible microscopy image at the top of the
area analyzed (scale bar is 500 μm), chemical images of gypsum
(1110 cm–1) and Ca stearate (1575 cm–1), and FTIR spectra of gypsum (red line) and Ca stearate (gold line).
(b) Leather cover, manuscript dated 1750: visible microscopy image
at the top of the area analyzed (scale bar is 500 μm), chemical
images of CaCO3 (1415 cm–1), Ca stearate
and FTIR spectra of CaCO3 (red line) and Ca stearate (gold
line). The composite images, processed with ImageJ, show the correlation
in the presence of soaps (assigned color yellow) and the original
calcium-based materials (assigned color red).

A strong band (Figure 3a) at about 1110 cm–1 along with a sharp
band at 1620 and two bands at 3533 and 3394 cm–1 indicated the presence of gypsum bihydrated (CaSO4·2H2O). Powdered gypsum was sometimes used in animal skin processing
to remove the excess fat.26 The presence
of calcium sulfate bihydrated in leather has been linked also to the
reaction of sulfate ions with residual calcium milk used in the unhairing
process of the animal skin.27 Here, gypsum
was detected in the 17th century leather cover sample only, along
with calcium carbonate, but its concentration was far less strong
than gypsum. This suggested that gypsum could be an original material
of the cover added during its manufacturing and not a degradation
product.

Spectral bands of lipids (Figures 2 and 3), likely to
originate
from a fat substance used to treat the leather surface or fat residue
of the animal skin, were observed at ∼2920 and 2850 cm–1 corresponding to the νas and νs CH2 groups and at ∼1735, 1468–60,
1240, and 1175 cm–1 assigned to the νas C=O bonds, the bending (δ) of CH2 groups, the νas and νs of C–O–C
bonds.

Two sharp bands at 1575 and 1540 cm–1 along with
two more bands at 1465 and 1420 cm–1 were detected,
a typical spectral pattern of metal soaps (metal carboxylates). A
distinctive match with the spectrum of calcium stearate from the IRUG
database strongly supports this assignment.28 The doublet at 1575 and 1540 cm–1 was assigned
to the νas COO– and the band at
1420 cm–1 to the νs mode.29 The bands at 1465, 2920, and 2850 cm–1 were assigned to the δ, the νas, and νs modes of CH2 groups of the typical soap aliphatic
chain, respectively. Interestingly, the images obtained by spatially
plotting the absorbance of Ca stearate, Ca carbonate, and gypsum revealed
a correlation in their distribution (Figure 3).

In oil paintings, metal soaps can
spontaneously form because of
the interaction of the fatty acid fractions of drying oils used as
binders with the cations in the inorganic pigments and are considered
responsible for the formation of protrusions and deformations in the
paint layers.17,30−32 Similarly,
the Ca2+ of the carbonate and sulfate in the leather samples
analyzed may have reacted with the fatty acids of an oil used to treat
the cover surface via a saponification reaction to give Ca soaps.
On closer examination, it appeared that the carbonate and sulfate
absorbance decreased as the stearate absorbance increased (Figure 4), which is the evidence
of saponification of CaCO3 and gypsum.

Figure 4 Macro ATR–FTIR
spectroscopic imaging of the top external
surface of two leather cover samples: (a) 17th century manuscript
and (b) the manuscript dated 1750. The images of the integrated absorbance
of CaCO3 (1415 cm–1), gypsum (1110 cm−1 and Ca stearate (1575 cm–1) and the FTIR spectra extracted from pixel 1 to 5 (p1 to p5) clearly
show that absorbance of the Ca stearate increases as absorbance of
the carbonate and sulfate decreases. Spectra are vector-normalized.

Metal soaps have been detected
previously in historical leather
objects in areas where the leather was in contact with metal elements.33 However, the leather covers from which the samples
were taken did not have metal features, and only calcium soaps were
detected. It has also been suggested that metal soaps could have been
the result of a mixture of fat and wood ash applied to the leather
surface during manufacturing.34 In the
case of the leather book covers studied in this work, it is known
that the covers have been not treated with this type of lubricant
substances in the past. To the best of our knowledge, only one publication
has demonstrated the presence of calcium soaps in leather covers,
suggesting they could originate from the reaction of metal oxides
with fat residues retained by the skin from the manufacturing process.35 However, the formation mechanism of these soaps
was not investigated. As evident in Figures 3 and 4, the distribution
of the Ca soaps with respect to CaCO3 and gypsum strongly
indicates that a saponification reaction is responsible for Ca stearate
formation. This is of major concern for conservators as soap formation
could result in damages to the leather artefacts, for example, by
attracting humidity in the structure of the cover.

3.1 Treated
Leather Book Cover Samples
The soybean oil emulsion was applied
by a brush to restore flexibility
to the leather covers and remove humidity that can damage the collagen
structure. The distribution of the oil emulsion in the leather is
mainly carried out with a visible microscope with the aid of special
dyes that react with fat molecules. However, this can be misleading
as the dyes may react with other fat substances already present in
the leather cover. Here, we tested the effectiveness of locating the
oil treatment and discriminating it from original lipid materials
in the leather samples provided by exploiting the differences in the
molecular structure that give different IR bands and band position.
In Figure 5, the macro
ATR–FTIR spectroscopic imaging results of the cover samples
from the manuscript dated 1750 and the Amsterdam Bible dated 1666
are reported. The spectroscopic images depict the distribution of
the carbonyl stretching mode ν (C=O) at 1742 cm–1 of the treatment well discernible from the distribution of the carbonyl
band at 1732 cm–1 associated with a possible lipid
material applied in the past on the leather surface. The spectroscopic
image (not reported) related to the weak band at 3008 cm–1 (indicated with an arrow in Figure 5b) attributed to the stretching of unsaturated CH groups
also confirmed the distribution of the soybean oil treatment in the
area of the samples analyzed.

oil emulsion acquired
with the Alpha spectrometer and a single element detector and (b)
FTIR spectra extracted from the macro ATR–FTIR images of the
top side of the treated leather cover sample from the manuscript dated

to a lipid component of the leather (p1) and the treatment (p2). (c,d)

the ν C=O (1742 cm–1) of the oil treatment;

dated 1750 (c) and the Amsterdam Bible dated 1666 (d). In the composite
image, purple is assigned to the soybean oil emulsion and green is
assigned to the lipid component of the leather cover.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, it is demonstrated how the sensitivity, chemical
specificity, and spatial resolution of ATR–FTIR spectroscopic
imaging can be used to successfully study particularly fragile materials
such as leather book covers. Macro-ATR–FTIR spectroscopic imaging
with a diamond ATR accessory without using a microscope has been applied
to nondestructive investigations of relatively large areas of samples
of historical leather book covers with a micrometer-scale spatial
resolution. No damage is caused to the samples by the selected measurement
mode. Therefore, the samples can be further analyzed with other techniques.
For the first time, clear evidence has been obtained for the formation
of calcium soaps (Ca stearate). These soaps were found in all the
leather samples analyzed, suggesting that there is no evidence to
link/correlate their formation to/with the provenance or manufacturing
technology. Further analysis would improve our understanding of the
formation mechanism and if a correlation exists between the soaps
and the preservation state of these objects. Spectroscopic images
allowed us to evaluate the presence of the soybean oil emulsion and
to differentiate it from other fat or oil substances present on the
leather covers prior to the treatment. This provided a more realistic
evaluation of the presence of the soybean oil in the leather sample
treated, compared to the observation with a visible microscope only.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that discrimination between preserved
collagen and the gelatin present on the surface of the studied samples
is possible with this setup.

Finally, the origin of significant
shifts of strong spectral bands
of the studied samples caused by anomalous dispersion was verified
by measuring pure calcium carbonate and gelatin with the same setup.
This aided assignment of the spectral bands of the samples from historical
leathers and, more generally, it could benefit the field of spectroscopic
imaging.
