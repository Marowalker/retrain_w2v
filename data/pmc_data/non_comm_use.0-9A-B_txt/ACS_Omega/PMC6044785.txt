Little
is known about the biological and structural features that
govern the isoform selectivity for class I histone deacetylases (HDACs)
over HDAC6. In addition to that for known inhibitors, like benzamides,
psammaplin A, and cyclodepsipeptide-derived thiols, selectivity was
also observed for naturally occurring cyclopeptide HDAC inhibitors
with an aliphatic flexible linker and ketonelike zinc-binding group
(ZBG). The present study reports that this isoform selectivity is
mainly due to the linker and ZBG, as replacement of the cyclopeptide
cap region by a simple aniline retained class I HDAC isoform selectivity
toward HDAC6 in enzymatic assays. The best cyclopeptide-free analogues
preserved efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum and cancer cell lines. Molecular modeling provided hypotheses to
explain this selectivity and suggests different behaviors of the flexible
linker on HDAC1 and HDAC6 pockets, which may influence, on the basis
of the strength of the ZBG, its coordination with the zinc ion.

Introduction
Histone deacetylases
(HDACs) have been extensively investigated
for many years as targets to combat cancer,1 neurological disorders, as well as inflammatory, viral,2 and, more recently, parasitic diseases.3 In recent years, four HDAC inhibitors (HDACi’s)
have been approved by the FDA for use in cancer treatment.4 HDACs and histone acetyltransferases (HATs) form
two families of enzyme with antagonist actions on the acetylation
status of histone. Together with other epigenetic marks (e.g., DNA
methylation, histone methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination),
histone acetylation is involved in gene regulation via cross-talk
leading to chromatin remodeling and accessibility.5 HDACs are responsible for the removal of acetyl groups
from lysine residues in the core histones. In humans, 18 HDAC isoforms
have been identified and split among four classes. Eleven HDACs contain
a conserved deacetylase domain that involves a zinc-dependent catalytic
site. They are divided into class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8), class
IIa (HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9), class IIb (HDACs 6 and 10), and class
IV (HDAC 11). The class III isoforms, named sirtuins (sirtuins 1–7),
require nicotine adenine dinucleotide as a cofactor and their catalytic
activity is independent of Zn2+. Class I HDACs are ubiquitous
in all tissues and are key players in epigenetic processes. They are
highly expressed in various cancer cell lines and sustain malignant
growth, making tumor cells more sensitive to HDACi treatment compared
with normal cells.6 With regard to emerging
therapeutic approaches, anti-latency therapy for persistent human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection used selective inhibitors
of class I HDACs to induce reactivation of HIV-1 transcription in
the 2D10 cell line.7 Recent studies on
apicomplexan intracellular parasites, such as Plasmodium
falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii, which are the causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis, respectively,
have demonstrated the central role of class I HDACs in parasite survival
and proliferation in the host cell.8 By
targeting HDAC3, FR235222, in nanomolar concentrations (Figure 1), inhibited the proliferative
and cystic forms of T. gondii.8,9 Class IIb HDAC6 is another prominent HDAC member found mainly in
the cytoplasm and hence not strictly involved in epigenetic functions.10 Thus, HDAC6 deacetylates α-tubulin and
chaperones, playing a role in cell trafficking, motility, and transcriptional
regulation.11

Figure 1 Representative structures
of natural and synthetic selective class
I HDAC inhibitors and the pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA.

From the perspective of deciphering specific epigenetic
pathways
linked to single HDAC isoforms, potent and isoform-selective HDACi’s
are required. The search for inhibitors having isoform selectivity
is also attractive from a therapeutic point of view to reduce off-target
activities and toxicity.12

To design
better HDACi’s, it is essential to understand
the structural regions necessary for class selectivity.13 The triad of cap/linker/zinc-binding group (ZBG)
is typically found in all potent HDACi’s, such as SAHA (Figure 1). The cap region
interacts with the rim of the enzyme, whereas the linker enters the
deep hydrophobic tunnel to properly position the ZBG in the catalytic
site.

Four main families of class I-selective HDACi’s
have been
identified on the basis of their ZBGs: benzamides (MS-275); psammaplin
A; and two groups of naturally occurring cyclopeptide compounds,14 a cyclodepsipeptide with a thiol ZBG (romidepsin,
largazole) and a cyclotetrapeptide with a ketonelike ZBG (FR235222,
trapoxin, apicidin). MS-275 has been reported to be a selective inhibitor
of class I HDAC1–3, without an effect on class I HDAC8.15 Optimization of the benzamide ZBG has led to
improved potency and high selectivity.16 The natural product psammaplin A and its thiol derivatives showed
high selectivity for class I HDACs (HDAC1–3 and HDAC8) versus
that for HDAC6.17 Trapoxin B is known to
be a highly potent inhibitor of class I HDACs, with no effect on the
activities of HDAC6 in cellulo.18 Apicidin
also showed marked isoform selectivity for class I HDACs over other
classes19 and has inspired the development
of new ethyl ketone ZBG derivatives for selective class I inhibition,
such as 1(20) and 2.21 In these cases, efforts were focused
on modulating the cap region to increase the potency for class I HDACs.

In the course of our attempts to synthesize new HDACi analogues
inspired by FR235222,22 we found evidence
that modulating the ZBG could also increase the potency. Keeping the
cyclotetrapeptide part unchanged (with R1, R2 = H; Figure 1), compound 3, having the (R)-hydroxyl ketone ZBG, was
shown to be more efficient in inhibiting the T. gondii RH strain (IC50 = 28.6 nM) than the corresponding analogue
with an ethyl ketone group (IC50 = 172 nM).22 However, why the ketonelike ZBG inhibitors are
selective for class I HDACs and do not affect HDAC6 remains unclear
and has been little explored.

Here, we report the identification
and study of the structural
regions in FR235222 necessary for class I versus class IIb selectivity.
The combination of (R)-hydroxyl ketone, as a medium-range
zinc chelator, with a flexible linker, on its own, is sufficient to
provide selectivity. This simple pharmacophore combined with minimal
caps can maintain HDAC isoform selectivity and inhibitory activities
against P. falciparum and human cancer
cell lines. Finally, docking calculations followed by molecular dynamic
simulations were performed to gain insights into HDAC structure/selectivity
relationships.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The
analogue cyclotetrapeptide 3 showed cellular effects
similar to those observed with FR23522222 and was used as the basis for structural deconvolution.
The goal of this study was to replace the cyclotetrapeptide part by
a simple cap, like the aniline amide group found on SAHA. Given that
the ZBG seems to be necessary for the activity and on the basis of
previous studies,22 various ZBGs could
easily be grafted onto any cap group having a linker ending with a
terminal olefin. Aniline amides with various linker lengths, 6a–c, were synthesized from aniline 4 (Scheme 1) to determine the optimal linker length. Derivatives 6a–c were condensed with (R)-hydroxyl
ketone xanthate 7(22) to give
the corresponding xanthate products, 10a–c, according to Zard’s reaction conditions.23 The hypophosphorus acid condition24 was used to remove the xanthate group. During
this step, an unexpected concomitant silyl deprotection occurred,
providing us with direct access to the desired products, 11a–c. Using the best linker length determined with 11b, (S)-hydroxyl ketone 8 and
ethyl ketone 9 xanthates22 were used to make analogues 11f and 11g, respectively. Their potency in comparison to that of the (R)-hydroxyl ketone ZBG was determined. As the acetylated
version of the (R)-hydroxyl ketone ZBG with cyclotetrapeptide 13 showed promising activity in cellular assays,22 the simplified analogue, 12b, was
made by acylation of 11b. 3-Ethynyl aniline 5 was later used as the starting material to obtain 3-phenyl-triazol-aniline
as the cap group (6e). This choice was influenced by
the work of Kozikowski,25 who reported
that similar motifs significantly increased HDAC3-selective inhibition.
The 3-phenyl-triazol-aniline cap analogue, 11e, was synthesized
with the optimal linker length and the ZBG found in the natural product
FR235222.

Biological Evaluation
Our previous results22 indicated that
cyclotetrapeptides 3 and 13 strongly inhibited
the proliferation of P. falciparum and
human cancer cell lines. The HDAC
inhibitory activity of compounds 3, 11a–c, 11e–g, 12b, 13, and 14 was initially evaluated using
a HeLa nuclear extract containing a mixture of nuclear HDAC isoforms
(mainly HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3); the activity under these conditions
was compared to that with HDAC6 (Table 1). All compounds were initially tested at 100 μM
on HeLa nuclear extracts to detect class I HDACs inhibitory compounds.
A 50% inhibition cutoff was applied to select compounds for class
I IC50 determination. Compounds 3 and 13 exhibited a good inhibition potency against class I HDACs,
whereas no effect was observed with HDAC6 (IC50 > 300
μM).
The high selectivity is remarkable for 3 and is comparable
to results obtained with apicidin.19 The
next step was to determine whether the cyclotetrapeptide plays a critical
role in HDAC inhibition or selectivity. The cyclotetrapeptide region
without ZBG 14(22) was evaluated
using HDAC enzymatic assays, and the observations were in line with
the demonstrations by Ghadiri26 and Olsen27 that a cyclodepsipeptide lacking the ZBG could
efficiently inhibit HDAC activity. The cyclotetrapeptide without ZBG 14 had no inhibitory effect on class I HDACs or HDAC6 (IC50 > 300 μM), suggesting that the linker and ZBG are
necessary for its biological activity. The cyclotetrapeptide region
was then replaced by the aniline amide cap found on SAHA. The HDAC
inhibitory activities of compounds 11a–c were compared to define the optimal linker length. Compound 11b showed the best activity and, notably, has the same linker
length as SAHA. Interestingly, this truncated structure showed good
selectivity for class I HDACs (IC50 = 8.9 μM) versus
that for HDAC6 (IC50 > 300 μM), whereas the shorter-linker-length
analogue, 11a, displayed marginal HDAC6 activity. Using
the optimal linker length, the impact of substituting the FR235222
(R)-hydroxyl ketone ZBG with the (S)-hydroxyl ketone (11f) or ethyl ketone (11g) found on apicidin was studied. With the same cap (simple aniline),
ketone hydroxyl groups 11b and 11f were
more efficient than ethyl ketone group 11g, and the (R)-hydroxyl configuration, 11b, remained the
best. Finally, substitution of aniline with ortho-phenyl triazole aniline (11e) efficiently increased
the potency of the compound for class I HDACs while maintaining the
selectivity.

SD of three independent experiments; N.D., not determined.

b Not active (inhibition < 50%
at 100 μM); HeLa nuclear extract (IC50 cutoff; 20
μM).

IC50 values lower than 20 μM were determined for
the displayed compounds 3, 13, 11b, and 11e; therefore, these compounds were further tested
on a panel of recombinant class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC3/NCOR2, HDAC8)
and class IIa HDAC4 to determine dose responses (starting at 100 μM).
These products showed a lack of activity on class IIa HDAC4 extending
the isoform selectivity of the hydroxyl ketone ZBG to this class of
HDACs. Inhibition of class I HDAC8 was observed with the two most
potent inhibitors (3 and 13), underlining
the positive contribution of the cyclotetrapeptide to ligand efficiency.
In class I inhibition, compound 11b showed a noticeable
preference for HDAC1 over HDAC3. Modulation of 11b to
produce 11e in turn improved the selectivity for HDAC3
compared to that for HDAC1. The results from comparing the performances
of recombinant HDACs, which are purified enzymes, and HeLa nuclear
extracts, which contain a mixture of nuclear HDAC isoforms in a multienzyme
complex, should be interpreted with caution and may explain the lower
IC50 values determined in recombinant HDAC assays (Table 2) compared to those
determined with HeLa nuclear extracts (Table 1). However, the possibility that these products
inhibit another HDACs cannot be ruled out.

Next, the most enzymatically active
compounds were evaluated for
their antiproliferative activity against P. falciparum and a panel of human cell lines (Table 3). The two cyclotetrapeptides, 3 and 13, were known to be good inhibitors of cell proliferation,
with GI50 values against P. falciparum of 17.4 and 22.2 nM,22 respectively,
and with GI50 ranging from 6 to 170 nM when used with the
Jurkat, K562, HeLa, or HEK293 cell lines. The simplified analogues
remained bioactive on cells but at much lower levels. Compound 11e appeared to be the most promising simplified analogue.
An additional assay on normal B lymphocytes was performed and showed
that 11e had GI50 > 50 μM. However,
these inhibitors showed little selectivity in terms of the cytotoxicity
between P. falciparum and the human
cell lines.

Molecular Modeling and Docking Calculations
Compounds 11b and 11e (Tables 1 and 2) are good examples
of HDACi’s that selectively inhibit class I HDACs over class
IIb HDAC6 and class IIa HDAC4. Compound 11b was selected
for the computational study as it only differs from SAHA in its ZBG
(same cap and same linker length) and therefore offers the opportunity
to directly compare the (R)-hydroxy ketone ZBG with
a classic hydroxamate ZBG. Thus, its structure is very similar to
that of SAHA, which in addition to class I HDACs also inhibits HDAC6
and HDAC4. To understand this difference, docking studies were performed
for SAHA and 11b on HDAC1, HDAC6, and HDAC4. The X-ray
structures available for HDAC1 and HDAC4 were used (PDB: 4BKX, 5A2S). For HDAC6, all
studies presented below were performed with a HDAC6 homology model,
as described in the Experimental Methods section,
as no structure was available at the time the experiments were performed.
However, the main result was confirmed by the very recently published
HDAC6 X-ray structure (PDB: 5EDU).29

Docking Calculations
For HDAC1, the docking positions
of SAHA and 11b showed that their ZBGs bound in a similar
manner, with bidentate coordination (Figure 2A). For HDAC4, different docking patterns
were obtained for SAHA and 11b. For SAHA, as expected,
a bidentate binding mode was observed (Figure 2C), whereas the 11b ligand penetrates
into the catalytic site from the other side (aniline cap) to form
a π–cationic interaction with an arginine and its phenyl
group (Figure 2D).
This π–cationic interaction has been described in trisubstituted
cyclopropane-bearing hydroxamate ZBGs designed as selective class
IIa inhibitors.30 In the case of 11b, the π–cationic interaction alone is weak,
which could explain the lack of activity observed for HDAC4. Finally,
for HDAC6, monodentate coordination was observed for both SAHA and 11b. Docking of 11b with a deprotonated ZBG was
also performed, and a similar position was observed (Figure S2). The aliphatic linker in the two compounds appears
to adopt a curled conformation and penetrates less deeply into the
catalytic site (Figure 2B). Compared with HDAC1, HDAC6 is known to have a broader catalytic
cavity,31 which may account for this difference
in the binding mode. However, this result remains insufficient to
explain the difference in affinity observed experimentally for SAHA
and 11b in HDAC6. To better understand this selectivity,
molecular dynamics simulations were performed on the docked position
obtained for both ligands in HDAC1 and HDAC6.

Figure 2 Best-ranked docked positions
obtained for SAHA (cyan stick atoms)
and 11b (yellow stick atoms) in HDAC1 (A), HDAC6 (B),
and HDAC4 (C, D).

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
To further extend our
understanding of the differences between compounds, molecular dynamics
simulations were performed. In HDAC1, the bidentate coordination with
the zinc atom remained the same for both SAHA and 11b (Figures 3 and S3). Ligands formed H-bonds with His140 and 141
and Tyr303 for SAHA and with His140 and Tyr303 for 11b.

Figure 3 Main interactions of SAHA (cyan stick atoms, A) and 11b (yellow stick atoms, B) with the characteristic residues of the
ZBG in HDAC1, determined by molecular dynamics simulations. The average
distances between O1 and Zn and O2 and Zn are, respectively, 2.40
and 2.32 Å for SAHA and 2.36 and 2.40 Å for 11b.

However, a different pattern was
obtained for the binding of SAHA
and 11b to HDAC6. As SAHA has a strong ZBG, the monodentate
coordination obtained from docking studies became bidentate as observed
for HDAC1 (Figures 4A and S4). This strong affinity of the
hydroxamate ZBG should explain why SAHA inhibits all HDAC isoforms
(Tables 1 and 2). In contrast, compound 11b seems
to have a weaker ZBG, and the monodentate coordination remained stable
in HDAC6 after molecular dynamics simulations (Figures 4B and S3). This
binding mode compared with the bidentate coordination of 11b in HDAC1 might explain the experimental data showing isoform selectivity
of the keto-hydroxyl ZBG for class I HDACs over HDAC6. Similarly, 11g can only show monodentate coordination through its carbonyl
group, which explains its lack of activity on both HDAC1 and HDAC6.
The weaker affinity of the keto-hydroxyl ZBG for the zinc atom is
also revealed by experimental data, as a simple change in configuration
from the hydroxyl group (11f) led to a significant decrease
in HDAC inhibition.

Figure 4 Main interactions of SAHA (cyan stick atoms, A) and 11b (yellow stick atoms, B) with the residues characterizing
the zinc-binding
domain of HDAC6, determined by molecular dynamics simulations. The
average distances between O1 and Zn and O2 and Zn are, respectively,
2.51 and 2.44 Å for SAHA, 2.37 and 3.91 Å for 11b.

Docking and dynamic simulations
performed with 11b on the very recent crystallographic
structure of HDAC6 (PDB: 5EDU) confirmed the monodentate
binding of the keto-hydroxyl ZBG (Figures S5 and S6). These results support the robustness of our model, in
agreement with the superposition of its backbone with the HDAC6 RX
(Figure S7). The positions of the residues
involved in the catalytic mechanism are well conserved. The position
determined for SAHA in HDAC6 from molecular dynamics simulations was
also compared to the binding mode described for SAHA in Danio rerio HDAC6 (PDB: 5EDU), and the binding mode described for
SAHA and the zinc atom was confirmed (Figure S8).

Conclusions
The reasons for isoform selectivity among
HDACs are often difficult
to rationalize. From the naturally occurring cyclotetrapeptide HDACi,
which has a ketonelike ZBG, we were able to shed light on a determining
factor that may trigger the selective inhibition of class I HDACs
(HDAC1) versus class IIb HDAC6. Reducing the structure of these natural
products to simple SAHA analogues (an aniline cap, a flexible linker,
and a ketonelike ZBG) led to the identification of two compounds, 11b and 11e, that showed significant activity
(in micromolar range) toward class I HDACs in enzymatic assays and
were also efficient inhibitors in cellular assays with P. falciparum and cancer cell lines, apparently due
to their ability to inhibit class I HDACs. Although benzamide and
thiol ZBG derivatives showed higher class I/class II HDACs selectivity
and potency, modulation by simple aniline caps is possible without
affecting the HDAC isoform selectivity of the hydroxyl ketone ZBG.
However, all simplified aniline analogues remain less efficient than
the cyclotetrapeptide cap, suggesting that this cap optimizes ligand
potency. Compound 11b and SAHA only differ in their ZBGs
(same cap and linker length) and offer the opportunity to directly
compare the (R)-hydroxy ketone ZBG with a classic
hydroxamate ZBG. Docking studies suggested that the ZBG of 11b could not coordinate in HDAC4. The comparison between class I HDACs
and HDAC6 based on docking studies followed by molecular dynamics
simulations revealed that the ZBG of 11b binds with bidentate
and monodentate coordination to HDAC1 and HDAC6, respectively. These
differences might explain the isoform selectivity of the keto-hydroxyl
ZBG for class I HDACs over HDAC6, while also providing a new perspective
for the design of selective HDACi’s. It has been established
that a key aspect may be related to the subtle association of a flexible
linker with a medium-range ZBG, such as (R)-hydroxyl
ketone.

HDAC Enzymatic Assays
The following
compounds were
tested for HDAC inhibition of HeLa nuclear extract (Enzo Life Sciences,
Lausen, Switzerland): HDAC1, HDAC3/NCOR2, and HDAC6 (Sigma-Aldrich,
Buchs, Switzerland) and HDAC4 and HDAC8 (Reaction Biology Corp.).
The substrate concentration was 50 μM. The highest concentration
used for single isoforms was 300 μM. IC50 values
were considered >300 μM when the % inhibition was ≪50%
at this concentration. Reactions were carried out in 96-well 1/2 volume
microplates. The HeLa nuclear extract or specific isoforms were diluted
in assay buffer (50 mM Tris at pH 8.0, adjusted with HCl; 137 mM NaCl;
2.7 mM KCl; and 1 mM MgCl2) and added to each microplate
well, except for blanks. The test compounds were diluted in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the wells (5% DMSO in each well). The
reaction was initiated by addition of the MAL substrate (BOC-Ac-Lys-AMC;
Sigma-Aldrich) for HeLa nuclear extract, HDAC1, and HDAC6 or the Fluor
de Lys SIRT1 deacetylase substrate (BML-KI177; Enzo) for HDAC3. The
plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min (HeLa nuclear extract,
HDAC1, and HDAC6) or 30 min (HDAC3). The reaction was stopped with
1 μM Trichostatin A. Trypsin from the bovine pancreas, 7500
BAEE units/mg (Sigma-Aldrich), was added 30 min prior to plate reading.
HDAC inhibition was calculated by comparing the amount of deacetylated
substrate between the control (100% HDAC activity) and test sample.
The relative amount of deacetylated substrate was obtained by fluorescence
reading with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm for HeLa
nuclear extract, HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC6. Dose–response curves
were obtained with six different concentrations to determine the IC50 values of the compounds showing more than 50% inhibition
at 100 μM using the HeLa nuclear extract. Results are the mean
of three independent experiments. SAHA was used as a positive control.
HDAC4 and HDAC8 assays were performed by Reaction Biology Corp.

Antiproliferative Activity on Human Cell Lines
XTT
assays were conducted as previously described to examine the inhibitory
effects of the compounds in various human cell lines.35 Briefly, normal B lymphocytes (15 000 cells/well),
HeLa, and HEK cells (10 000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well
plates and treated immediately with increasing concentrations in triplicates.
After 72 h of incubation, 50 μL of XTT solution (1 mg/mL in
culture medium supplemented with an electron carrier) was added to
the cells and incubated for 4 h. The percentage of cell growth was
calculated as the absorbance of each test well divided by that of
the vehicle control wells, multiplied by 100. The concentration that
resulted in a 50% reduction in cell growth (GI50) was determined
from at least five different concentrations using GraphPad Prism 5.0
software. With Jurkat and K562, cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 complemented
with 10% FCS in 96-well microplates (8000 cells/well) and incubated
at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in the presence of various concentration
of tested molecules, as above. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C,
[3H]-thymidine was added to each well. After an additional
6 h of incubation at 37 °C, incorporation of [3H]-thymidine
in nucleic acids was measured as indicated below.

P. falciparum Assay
In vitro antimalarial
activity was measured on microtiter plates,
using the [3H]-hypoxanthine incorporation assay with the
3D7 strain of P. falciparum, as previously
described.36 Briefly, suspensions of infected
erythrocytes at 1.5% final hematocrit and 0.6% parasitemia were cultured
in complete medium (RPMI 1640, complemented with 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,
and 10% AB+ human serum) either in the absence (controls)
or in the presence of the compounds within a range of molecular concentrations.
The compounds were usually dissolved in DMSO and were diluted in culture
medium so that the final DMSO concentration never exceeded 0.25%.
After 48 h of incubation at 37 °C, under a gaseous mixture of
5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2, [3H]-hypoxanthine was added to each well for 18 h. Then, the
cells were lysed using an automatic cell harvester and the cell macromolecules,
including radioactive nucleic acids, were retained onto glass fiber
filters and counted for radioactivity.

Molecular Modeling
Molecular docking calculations were
conducted using GOLD software (version 5.237) with the preset options for the genetic GOLD algorithm and the
ChemPLP scoring function. Zinc atom was used as the centroid, and
the size of the docking cavity was 10 Å. One hundred poses were
generated for each ligand. To compare all solutions, root-mean-square
deviations (rmsd’s) among different structures were computed
and clusters of solutions were formed according to their rmsd values.
The best-ranked docking poses were then visually inspected in Pymol,
version 2006.38

To validate the molecular
docking protocol, SAHA was redocked into the catalytic pocket of HDAC2,
wherein a co-crystallized structure exists (PDB: 4LXZ). Results are given
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The same protocol was used to target HDAC1 and HDAC6. HDAC1 was
taken from the Protein Data Bank (PDB: 4BKX), whereas a homology model of the HDAC6
catalytic site CD II (from Leu483 to Gly800, Uniprot ID Q9UBN7) was
built with MOE 2014.09 (www.chemcomp.com). Despite the higher % of identity with class IIa HDACs (HDAC4 and
HDAC7), the crystal structure of HDAC8 (PDB: 1T69) was chosen as the
template for building the model, as also recently proposed.39 HDAC8 shares with HDAC6 a catalytic Tyr residue
(Tyr306 in HDAC8, Tyr782 in HDAC6) and a similar manner of binding
inhibitors, making the design of selective inhibitors toward these
two isoforms difficult.40 Alignment of
HDAC6 and HDAC8 sequences was carried out with the MOE Align program
using default parameters. HDAC6 CD II shares 28% identity and 46%
similarity with HDAC8. Comparative model building was then carried
out with the MOE Homology Model module. Fifty intermediate models
were built, refined, and scored with the GB-IV scoring function, using
the AMBER99 force field: A refined and averaged model was finally
generated and taken into account. Zinc ion coordinates were transferred
from the template to the target. Lateral chains and only the zinc
ion were then submitted to 1000 minimization cycles in the Sybyl X
1.3 suite (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) using the AMBER99 force field
and Powell algorithm. The quality of the minimized model (coordinates
given in the Supporting Information) was
checked by monitoring the Ramachandran plot, MOE protein geometry
module, Errat, Verify3D, and QMEAN score, and the results are given
in the Supporting Information.

Docking
was done keeping the proteins fixed, whereas the ligands
fully flexible. Ligands were built and their geometries optimized
using Gaussian09 software41 at the B3LYP/6-31g*
level. Different protonation states were tested for their ZBG groups.

Before docking calculations, short molecular mechanical (MM) dynamics
were performed on the structures of the protein (X-ray structure and
model) using the AMBER12 software,42 under
periodic boundary conditions. For X-ray structures, water and other
co-crystallized molecules were also removed. The two neighboring histidines
close to the active site (e.g., for HDAC1, His140 and 141) are protonated
at the delta position (HID). For other amino acids residues, the tool
xleap of Amber12 was used to add the missing protons. The systems
were solvated with a TIP3P water rectangular box. For the zinc atom,
nonbonded parameters and a charge of two were added. The dimensions
of the TIP3P water rectangular box were chosen to be at least 10 Å
larger than that of the solute in every direction. Sodium cations
were added and long-range electrostatic interactions were computed
using the particle-mesh Ewald method, with a cutoff value of 10 Å.
The time step was set at 1 fs. Minimization and heating in the NVT
ensemble were carried out. Then a molecular dynamics production phase
was run in the NPT ensemble at 300 K over 1 ns.

MM simulations
were also performed on a few structures of complexes
obtained from docking under the same conditions. In the case of the
monodentate interaction, 20 ns of simulations was done to check the
stability of the structure. For the better known bidentate interaction,
only 5 ns of simulations was done. For ligands, parameters were generated
using the program Antechamber of Amber with the GAFF force field.
Partial charges were obtained by the RESP approach after Gaussian09
calculation of the electrostatic potential in the MK scheme at the
HF/6-31g* level.
