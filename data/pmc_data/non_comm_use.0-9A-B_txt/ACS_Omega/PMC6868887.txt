In this study, water-soluble emissive
carbon dots (CDs) are effectively
fabricated with specific optical properties and colors by acid oxidation
of muskmelon (Cucumis melo) fruit,
which are termed as C. melo CDs (CMCDs).
The fluorescence properties of CMCDs were tuned by controlling the experimental conditions
that allow them to emit different colors, that is, blue (B-), green
(G-), and yellow (Y-) CMCDs, with different emission wavelengths at
432, 515, and 554 nm when excited at 342, 415, and 425 nm, respectively.
The fabricated multicolor-emissive CDs were confirmed by various analytical
techniques. The sizes of B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs were found to be ∼3.5,
∼4.3, and ∼5.8 nm, respectively. The as-prepared CMCDs
display stable emissions with quantum yields of 7.07, 26.9, and 14.3%
for the three CMCDs, which could act as a promising probe for the
selective detection of Hg2+ ions. Upon the addition of
Hg2+ ions, the fluorescence intensity of G-CMCDs at 515
nm was quenched largely than that of B- and Y-CMCDs. The spectroscopic
results display that the G-CMCDs acted as a sensor for the detection
of Hg2+ ions with a wide linear range from 1.0 to 25 μM
(R2 = 0.9855) with a detection limit of
0.33 μM. This method was successfully applied to detect Hg2+ ions in biological and water samples. The fabricated multicolor-emissive
CMCDs possess the cell (Cunninghamella elegans, Aspergillus flavus, and Rhizoctonia solani) imaging property, suggesting
the biocompatible nature for multicolor imaging of various cells.

1 Introduction
In
order to meet environmental regulations and to reduce toxic
chemicals, various kinds of new nanomaterials [semiconductor quantum
dots, noble metal nanoclusters, and carbon dots (CDs)] have been integrated
with analytical techniques for the recognition of trace-level target
analytes.1 Importantly, ultrasize CDs have
been recognized as a specific class of biocompatible materials with
remarkable applications in multidisciplinary research area because
of their unique properties such as high dispersibility in aqueous
media, nontoxicity, outstanding photostability, low cost, biocompatibility,
easy synthesis, and different emission colors.2−4 Further, this
new class of CDs exhibited excellent optical and physicochemical properties
(strong and tunable emission, high quantum yield (QY), and multifunctional
groups on the surface) as compared to semiconductor quantum dots and
metal nanoclusters using them as potential candidates in chemical
and biosensing, biomedical, cell imaging, and catalytic applications.5−9

Usually, various molecules and materials (biomolecules, organic,
natural sources, and waste materials) have been used as precursors
for the preparation of fluorescent CDs with improved QY.10−13 To derive CDs, several carbonization approaches such as microwave
synthesis,10 electrochemical oxidation,14 arc discharge,15 hydrothermal
approach,4 combustion/thermal approach,
pyrolysis,16 and laser ablation17 have been used for the synthesis of a unique
class of fluorescent CDs and their uses in optical sensing and bioimaging.
Among these, the chemical oxidation of natural sources by using alkali
and acid has shown a significant impact in producing CDs with multicolor-emissive
CDs without addition of additional reagent.18 To obtain novel ultrasmall carbon nanoparticles, the use of a new
green material as a precursor may have an impact on the development
of nanoanalytical science.

Furthermore, a great deal of research
has been focused on the fabrication
of ultrasize fluorescent CDs using various natural resources or cheap
materials as precursors such as Solanum lycopersicum,12 pasteurized milk,19 papaya juice,20 potato,21 dried shrimp,22 apple
juice,23Punica granatum fruit,24 sugarcane juice,25 watermelon peel,26 jamun,27 and soy milk.28 These approaches have shown significant advantages (eco-friendly
and inexpensive precursors and high QY) for generation of CDs and
successfully integrated with various analytical techniques for the
development of sustainable nanoprobes for environmental applications.
Even though significant progress has been made on the development
of CDs using various synthetic approaches, unfortunately these methods
have shown inability to generate CDs with high QY and multicolor emission,
which limits their potential applications in the fields of sensing
and cell imaging. Among the heavy metals, mercury has been considered
as one of the serious toxic elements and shows high toxic nature to
the living system including plants, animals, and humans.29 Noticeably, Hg2+ has shown high ability
to adsorb on the biological tissues (skin, gastrointestinal tissues,
and respiratory systems), showing adverse effects on DNA, nervous
system, brain, kidney functions, and eyesight.30−32 In view of
this, the fluorescent-based probes have proven to be a hallmark analytical
platform for the analysis of Hg2+ ions because of their
notable advantages, that is, rapidity, simplicity, cost-effectiveness,
sensitivity, and on-site monitoring applications.33−37 Thus, they have been proven as alternative analytical
platforms to several traditional tools including electrochemical method,
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, auger electron spectroscopy,
and atomic absorption spectroscopy.38−41 However, some of the fluorescent
probes require specific chemicals, toxic chemicals, and multistep
reactions, which limits their environmental applications. Recently,
the research of new carbon-based nanomaterials has been explored tremendously
for various applications because of cost-effective precursors and
multicolor emissions. Thus, ultrasize CDs were successfully integrated
with fluorescence spectrometry for the recognition of inorganic species
including Hg2+ ions with excellent sensitivity.10,42,43 For example, Hg2+ ions
were effectively and selectively recognized from various environmental
samples by using ultrasize CDs prepared from corn bract, honey, urine,
uric acid, citric acid and guanidine hydrochloride, spermine, and
citric acid as precursors.44−49Cucumis melo fruit belongs to Cucurbitaceae
family that contains several bioactive compounds, that is, pro-vitamin
A, vitamin C, folic acid, toxic cucurbitacins and flavanoids, and
phenolic compounds. Thus, it could be used as a low-cost carbon precursor
for the fabrication of fluorescent CDs.

Herein, C. melo fruit for the first
time is used as a precursor for the fabrication of multicolor [blue
(B), green (G), and yellow (Y)]-emissive CDs via acid (H2SO4 and H3PO4) oxidation and the
formed CDs are abbreviated as C. melo CDs (CMCDs; B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs) (Scheme 1). The CMCDs showed excellent affinity toward
Hg2+ ions, which results in quenching the fluorescence
spectra of CMCDs and yielding a good linear response between I0 – I/I0 and concentration of Hg2+ ions (1–25
μM). The current method exhibits several advantages such as
fast detection and low detection limit (LOD) (0.33 μM), exploring
them as superior probes to the organic-based fluorescent sensors.
Furthermore, the potential use of CMCDs was explored for bioimaging
of multiple fungal species including Cunninghamella
elegans, Aspergillus flavus, and Rhizoctonia solani sp., signifying
their superiority as the potential candidate for cell imaging with
better resolution, which may further extend their novel applications
in the field of analytical and bioanalytical science.

Scheme 1 Fabrication
of Multicolor-Emissive CDs from C. melo Fruit as a Carbon Source via Acid Oxidation
2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Musk
melon was collected
from the local supermarket. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95%) and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) were procured from Finar PVT, LTD, India, and metal salt was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Dialysis membrane-70 (12–14 kDa molecular
weight cutoff) was purchased from Hi-media Laboratory Pvt., India.
Purified water was collected from Millipore-Q water system and used
for whole experiments. QY was calculated by using quinine sulfate
(54%) as a reference standard for B- and G-CMCDs and rhodamine 6G
(95%) for Y-CMCDs.

2.2 Characterization of Multicolor-Emissive
CMCDs
To measure the UV–visible spectra of CMCDs,
a Maya Pro 2000
spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, USA) was used. The excitation and
emission bands with a 5 nm slit width were recorded by a Carry Eclipse
fluorescence spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) using a xenon
flash lamp. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurement was carried
out on an ALPHA-II spectrophotometer (Bruker, Germany) to examine
the surface functionality of CMCDs. High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) (JEM-2100, JEOL, Japan) was performed with a 200
keV accelerating voltage to obtain the size and nanostructure information
of CMCDs. The hydrodynamic diameter was measured by using dynamic
light scattering (DLS) on a Zetasizer Nano ZS90, Malvern, UK, at room
temperature.

2.3 Synthesis of Fluorescent
CMCDs
Multicolor,
B-, G-, and Y-fluorescent CMCDs were synthesized from C. melo (musk melon) fruit with a slight modification
in the method described in the literature.12 First, peel was removed from the washed C. melo fruit and then sliced in small pieces. These fruit slices were stored
in a deep freezer (−20 °C). To synthesize the blue-colored
CMCDs, 10 mL of 34 N H2SO4 was added into a
beaker that contains 500 mg/mL of aqueous freeze-dried C. melo fruit. The mixture was sonicated for 5 min,
followed by heating at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, the pH of CMCDs
residues was neutralized to 7.0 pH by using 2 M NaOH. This neutralized
product was dialyzed for 24 h with distilled water to obtain blue-colored
CMCDs and then kept at 4 °C for further applications. To synthesize
the green fluorescent CMCDs, 500 mg of freeze-dried C. melo fruit was dissolved in 5 mL of water, followed
by the addition of 40 N H3PO4 (10 mL). The mixture
was heated at 80 °C for 25–30 min, and the pH of products
was adapted by using 1 M NaOH. The final product was dialyzed with
water for 14 h to generate green CMCDs. Similarly, yellow CMCDs were
generated by treating 500 mg of freeze-dried C. melo fruit with 40 N H3PO4 (10 mL). The resulting
mixture was heated at 80 °C for 15–20 min. The pH of the
product was adjusted to 7.0 by neutralizing with 1 M NaOH and then
purified by dialyzing with water for 14 h. The resulting fluorescent
CMCDs were stored at 4 °C for further applications.

2.4 Procedures for Hg2+ Detection
The detection
experiment was performed in an aqueous solution at
room temperature. Various concentrations of Hg2+ solution
(1.0–500 μM) were prepared and added into the sample
vials containing the aqueous solution of G-CMCDs. Then, the sample
vials were vortexed for 30 min at room temperature. The response of
Hg2+ onto the emission spectra of G-CMCDs at 415 nm of
excitation wavelength was recorded.

For exploring the practical
ability of the probe toward Hg2+ ions, human serum and
canal water samples were spiked with various concentrations of Hg2+ (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 μM). The spiked samples were mixed
with G-CMCDs and then the emission spectra of the final solutions
were recorded. The amount of Hg2+ ions was estimated by
using a calibration graph.

2.5 Fluorescence Imaging of
Multiple Fungal Species
(C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp.) by Using B-, G-,
and Y-CMCDs
Cell imaging of multiple fungal cells (C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp.) was employed
by confocal laser microscopy to evaluate the potential applications
of CMCDs. C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp. cells were spread in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) with fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%) in a moistened environment
of CO2 (5%) at 37 °C for further tests. The fungal
(C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp.) cells were again
subcultured and then incubated with DMEM in 10% FBS for 12 h. The
medium was then replaced by DMEM having B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs (1, 5,
and 6 μg/mL) for about 24 h, respectively. The fungal (C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp.) cells with CMCDs
were washed three times by using PBS and then the CMCD-conjugated C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp. cells were placed
on the fine slide of images which contain glycerol (50%) and paraformaldehyde
(4%) for cell fixation. The fluorescence images were captured by a
confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss 510 LSM, Jena, Germany) at different
laser excitation wavelengths of 405, 488, and 561 nm.

2.6 Cytotoxicity Studies
Methyl thiazoyl
diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was performed to confirm the
nonpoisonous features of CMCDs on normal rat kidney epithelial (NRK)
cells. The aqueous solutions of B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs with various concentrations
(0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg/mL) were introduced to the wells containing
NRK cells and then incubated for 15 h. Then, the wells were carefully
rinsed with PBS at pH 7.4. After this, the freshly prepared 50 μL,
5 mg/mL solution of MTT was introduced into the cells, followed by
incubation for 4 h. Further, the cell wells were washed three times
by using phosphate-buffered saline after removing the MTT from the
wells. Finally, the viability of the cell in each well was obtained
by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm on a microplate reader. The
cell viability was obtained by measuring the absorbance ratio of experimental
cells (well-CMCDs) to control cells (well).

3 Results and Discussion
Multicolor fluorescent, B-, G-, and
Y-CMCDs were prepared from C. melo fruit
as a carbon precursor, which contains
several bioactive compounds, that is, pro-vitamin A, vitamin C, folic
acid, toxic cucurbitacins and flavanoids, and phenolic compounds.
These chemicals play an important role to generate nanosized CMCDs
with diverse surface functionality. To fabricate B-, G-, and Y-color
florescent CMCDs from C. melo fruit,
H2SO4 and H3PO4 were used
as oxidizing agents at 80 and 100 °C (Scheme 1). Figure 1a–c represents the UV–visible absorbance
spectra of B-, G-, and Y-fluorescent CMCDs in aqueous solution, showing
the typical independent absorbance bands at 314, 414, and 467 nm for
B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs. These absorption bands show the existence of
different π–π* and n−π* electronic
transitions, which is due to several surface-state functionalities
(amine, hydroxyl, and carboxyl) onto the CMCDs. As-prepared CMCDs
emits blue-, green-, and yellow-colored fluorescence under UV light
at 365 nm of wavelength (inset in Figure 1), which confirms the formation of multicolor
florescent CMCDs. Interestingly, the dispersions of B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs
have displayed strong fluorescence emission peaks at 432, 515, and
554 nm when excited at 342, 415, and 425 nm, respectively (Figure 1). Similarly, the
changes in the emission wavelengths of the three (blue, green, and
yellow)-color CMCDs were examined by measuring their fluorescence
emission spectra at excitation wavelengths from 300 to 410, 320 to
460, and 350 to 470 nm for B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs, respectively (Figure S1a–c), which demonstrates the
excitation-dependent behavior of CMCDs. Hence, with the increasing
excitation wavelength, the emission peaks of the three CMCDs were
shifted toward the red region and the maximum emission intensities
were originated at 342, 415, and 425 nm of excitation wavelengths,
demonstrating the creation of CMCDs with diverse emission trap sites
as well as variation in size owing to the presence of multifunctional
groups onto the surface of CMCDs.11,12 The QYs of
B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs were found to be 7.07, 26.9, and 14.3%, which
are greater than the other reported methods.11,12 Further, the stability of these CMCDs was examined by evaluating
the emission spectra of CMCDs (Figure S2), indicating that the emission peak intensity of CMCDs was almost
unchanged up to 90 days and then the peak intensity decreased slightly.
Hence, these three-color CMCDs were stable up to 100 days, making
them as potential candidates for biological and sensing applications. Figure S3 shows the average fluorescence lifetimes
of B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs. The fluorescence lifetimes of B-, G-, and
Y-CMCDs were estimated to be 1.4, 4.9, and 7.1 ns, respectively, which
are longer than the autofluorescent cell.50 Thus, these findings suggest that the as-fabricated three CMCDs
could be used as ideal fluorescent probes for cell imaging and metal
ion detection.

properties of fluorescent (a) B- (b) G-, and (c) Y-CMCDs obtained
from C. melo fruit. The insets show
the optical images of CMCDs under a UV lamp at 365 nm.

Further, we explore the FT-IR features of the surface functional
groups of three-color fluorescent CMCDs derived from the C. melo fruit (Figure S4). It was noticed that the CMCDs showed a quite broad absorption
peak at 3550–3150 cm–1, which arises due
to the stretching vibrations of O–H and N–H groups of
three-color fluorescent CMCDs. The well-defined absorption peaks at
1637/1617, 1639, and 1657 cm–1 correspond to the
stretching vibrations of carboxylic and amide groups, while the bands
around (1398 and 1400 cm–1) are assigned to the
stretching of −C–NH–C groups in B- and G-CMCDs.
Similarly, the characteristic peaks at 1110, 1166, and 1150 cm–1 are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of C–S/C–N.
The stretching vibrations for P–O and P=O in G- and
Y-CMCDs were observed at (521 and 530 cm–1), (932
and 937 cm–1), and (1051 and 1079 cm–1), respectively. Figure 2 shows the HR-TEM studies of the three fluorescent CMCDs.
These results revealed that the as-prepared CDs are well dispersed
with fine spherical shape and identical size in the range of 2–5,
3.5–6, and 4.5–7 nm for B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs, respectively.
The average sizes of B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs are 3.5 ± 0.98, 4.3
± 0.84, and 5.8 ± 1.07 nm, respectively. The HR-TEM images
of CMCDs also demonstrated the crystalline nature of CMCDs, which
are quite similar to that of the CDs.11 Further, the DLS of CMCDs (Figure S5)
shows that the average hydrodynamic diameters of the three CMCDs are
7.01 ± 1.4, 8.35 ± 3, and 11.2 ± 3.01 nM, respectively,
which are well agreed with the HR-TEM results of CMCDs. Thus, distinctive
optical and spectral properties of CMCDs make them powerful sensors
for assaying the chemical species as well as cell imaging. To further
confirm the surface composition of B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs, X-ray photoelectron
spectra were studied for B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs. Figure S6 illustrates that the peaks at (136.1, 134.4, and
134.9), (287.4, 285.9, and 286.1), (403.7, 401.4, and 402.0), and
(534.2, 532.8, and 533.0) eV are attributed to P 2p, C 1s, N 1s, and
O 1s for the three CMCDs, respectively. The peak at 171.2 eV is assigned
to the S 2p of blue CMCDs. These results revealed the presence of
C, N, O, P, and S elements in the as-prepared three CMCDs. In the
high-resolution band of CMCDs of C 1s, the peaks obtained at (286.7,
285.7, and 285.9) and (294.9, 294.3, and 294.1) eV confirmed the existence
of C=C and C=O groups on the surface of B-, G-, and
Y-CMCDs (Figure S7a). Also, the peaks at
(399.78, 397.1, and 399.0), (401.2, 402.0, and 401.1), (533.7, 532.2,
and 532.4), and (537.6, 536.7, and 536.7) eV for blue-, green-, and
yellow-CMCDs, respectively, demonstrated the existence of multiple
functional groups including N–H, C–N–C, C=O,
C–O, and S–O on the surface of the three CMCDs (Figure S7b,c). The peak at (134.5 and 134.8)
eV corresponds to the P–C groups of G- and Y-CMCDs (Figure S7d), and the peak at 170.9 eV belongs
to the S 2p of blue CMCDs (Figure S7e).
Thus, the as-synthesized multicolor-emissive CMCDs possess several
functional groups on the surfaces, which may be responsible to tune
their optical properties.

3.1 Analytical Performance of Green CMCDs for
Detection of Hg2+ Ions
The analytical performance
of multicolor CMCDs was evaluated in the presence of different metal
ions. As shown in Figures 3 and S8a,b, among B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs,
the emission peak of G-CMCDs was specifically quenched only by Hg2+ ions, while other metal ions such as Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Cu2+, Cr3+, As3+, and As5+ ions did not show any significant effect
on the fluorescence emission spectra of B- and Y-CMCDs, indicating
the selectivity of G-CMCDs for Hg2+ ion sensing. Therefore,
this excellent specific nature of G-CMCDs toward Hg2+ ions
was further studied for the fair discerning analysis of Hg2+ ions. As depicted in Figure 4, with a gradual increase of Hg2+ ion concentration
from 1 to 500 μM, the emission peak of G-CMCDs was progressively
quenched, demonstrating a good linear calibration curve (R2 = 0.9855) between the relative intensity I0 – I/I0 (I0 and I stand for
the emission intensity of G-CMCDs at 515 nm before and after the addition
of Hg2+ ions) at 515 nm and different concentrations of
Hg2+ ions (1–25 μM). The LOD of Hg2+ ions is estimated to be 0.33 μM by using G-CMCDs, which was
measured by using 3σ/m (σ refers to the
standard deviation of blank and “m”
is the slope obtained from calibration curve). This limit of detection
is much lower compared to the permissible limits of Hg2+ recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The comparison of
the newly developed method for recognition of Hg2+ ions
with other reported techniques demonstrated that the fluorescence-based
G-CMCDs sensor shows quite comparable and higher sensitivity than
the reported methods (Table 1).10,37 Notably, the synthesis strategy
does not require any expensive chemicals, complicated experimental
procedure, and further surface functionalization. Therefore, the as-synthesized
green CMCDs are more convenient to use as a probe for the recognition
of Hg2+ ions.

CMCDs and Hg2+ ion concentration (1–25 μM).

3.2 Quenching Mechanism
The outstanding
selectivity of G-CMCDs toward Hg2+ ions could be ascribed
to the strong binding affinity between the multifunctional groups
of G-CMCDs (hydroxyl, amine, and carboxyl groups) with Hg2+, facilitating the specific interaction of G-CMCDs with Hg2+ ions. In order to realize the fluorescence quenching of G-CMCDs
by Hg2+ ions, fluorescence decay time measurement was performed.
The measured fluorescence decay time of G-CMCDs is 4.9 and 5.0 ns
with the addition of Hg2+ ions (Figure S9a). These results indicated that the lifetime of the G-CMCDs
does not change in the presence of Hg2+ ions, which confirmed
that the fluorescence quenching of G-CMCDs by Hg2+ ions
follows the static quenching mechanism. Therefore, the specific selectivity
of G-CMCDs is due to its high affinity to form a nonfluorescent ground-state
complex, causing the fluorescence quenching.55 Further, to understand the binding nature of G-CMCDs with Hg2+ ions, UV–visible absorption spectra of G-CMCDs and
G-CMCDs–Hg2+ were recorded, demonstrating that the
characteristic absorption of green CMCDs at 414 nm decreased, which
indicates that Hg2+ could change the electronic structure
of G-CMCDs via the formation of the ground-state complex (Figure S9b). On the other hand, because of the
presence of O–H, N–H and C=O groups on the surface
of green CMCDs, Hg2+ ions underwent a complexation reaction
with them, favoring to reconstruct the G-CMCDs, which results in quenching
the fluorescence intensity of G-CMCDs. Figure S9c shows the HR-TEM image of G-CMCDs in the presence of Hg2+ ions. It can be noticed that the larger aggregates were
generated when Hg2+ ions were introduced into the solution
of G-CMCDs. As a result, the hydrodynamic diameter of G-CMCDs was
also increased upon the addition of Hg2+ ions (shown in Figure S9d). These results suggested that the
specific quenching of fluorescence emission of G-CMCDs by Hg2+ ions might be due to the strong interaction between G-CMCDs and
Hg2+, which results to form G-CMCDs–Hg2+ aggregates via nonfluorescent ground-state complex formation.

3.3 Selectivity Studies
To further examine
the selectivity of the G-CMCDs-based fluorescence sensor for Hg2+, the quenching efficiency of Hg2+ in the presence
of other common chemical species such as metal ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, As3+, and Cr3+), anions (Cl–, S2–, CH3COO–, PO43–, NO3–, and Cr2O72–), and pesticides (thiram, chlopropham, quinalphos, monocrotophos,
and triazophos) were investigated and are shown in Figure S10. The concentration of all interfering agents was
500 μM. First, metal ions, anions, and pesticides are mixed
separately and added into the green CMCDs solution (Figure S10). It was observed that there is no such significant
change observed in the fluorescence intensity of G-CMCDs with the
other chemical species mixtures (metal ions, anions, and pesticides).
However, the emission intensity of G-CMCDs was quenched only in the
presence of Hg2+ ions, illustrating that the G-CMCD-based
fluorescence “turn-off” approach could be successfully
employed for Hg2+ detection in real samples.

3.4 Application of G-CMCDs for Real Sample Testing
To explore
the practical ability of this developed approach, the
G-CMCD-based fluorescence approach was further employed to assay Hg2+ in human serum and canal water samples. The samples (human
serum and canal water) were spiked with the stock solution of Hg2+ ions (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 μM) and then standard recovery
experiments were carried out by the aforementioned procedure. Table S1 depicts the percentage recoveries in
the range of 96.88–100.89% with relative standard deviation
values of 0.13–1.13% for assaying Hg2+ ions in human
serum and canal water samples, illustrating that the present method
for Hg2+ ion detection has high accuracy and precision,
which suggest that this method can be used as a portable analytical
approach for analysis of Hg2+ in real samples.

3.5 Imaging of C. elegans, A. flavus, and R.
solani sp. Cells and Cytotoxicity
To evaluate
the potentiality of multicolor-emissive CMCD applications in cell
imaging, C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp. cells were used to examine their imaging ability by fluorescence
microscopy. As shown in Figure 5, the fabricated CMCDs (blue, green, and yellow) displayed
blue, green, and red color signals when excited at 405, 488, and 561
nm, respectively. The CMCDs can be easily entered into the cell system
and dispersed into C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani cells through cell membrane and endocytosis. It can be observed
that the cells do not emit any fluorescence signals without CMCDs,
suggesting their successful distribution into the cells, which exposed
cell images with bright fluorescence signals. The cytotoxicity study
of multiple color CDs are examined on NRK cells, which shows their
efficiency in cell imaging. Further, the cytotoxicity study of different
concentrations of CMCDs (0.25–1.0 mg/mL) (Figure S11) was carried out by MTT assay against NRK cells.
These results revealed that the CMCDs exhibited nontoxic and biocompatible
nature up to 1.0 mg/mL, which also signifies their efficiency as a
fluorescent probe for imaging of C. elegans, A. flavus, and R.
solani sp. fungal cells.

Figure 5 Confocal microscopic
images of (a) C. elegans treated with
B-CMCDs (i–iii), (b) A. flavus treated with G-CMCDs (i–iv), and (c) R. solani sp. treated with Y-CMCDs (i–iii), at excitation wavelengths
of 405, 488, and 561 nm and 2 μm scale bar.

4 Conclusions
A simple and green/clean one-step
synthetic approach was explored
for the preparation of multicolor-emissive CMCDs from C. melo fruit as a new natural carbon source via
acid oxidation treatment. The use of different oxidizing agents and
optimum reaction parameters can easily tune the size and optical behavior
of CMCDs. The as-prepared B-, G-, and Y-CMCDs exhibit −CO,
−COOH, and −OH functional groups with an average size
of 3.5, 4.3, and 5.8 nm, showing excellent water solubility and strong
excitation-dependent emission properties. The G-CMCD-based sensing
technique was applied as a novel fluorescent probe for assaying Hg2+ ions without further modification. Among these three CMCDs,
green fluorescent CMCDs possess greater affinity to sense Hg2+ ions, display good linearity ranging from 1 to 25 μM with
a lower LOD of 0.33 μM. The G-CMCDs exhibited high selectivity
for the analysis of Hg2+ ions and quantified in real samples
(serum and canal water) with good percentage recoveries of 96.88–100.89%.
The as-synthesized CMCDs showed nontoxic and biocompatible nature
toward fungal cells and are used as probes for imaging C. elegans, A. flavus, and R. solani sp. fungal cells. The
present approach exhibited a quite promising strategy for the real-time
monitoring of Hg2+ ions in human serum and canal water
samples, which meets the requirement of USEPA and WHO for Hg2+ analysis in real samples.
