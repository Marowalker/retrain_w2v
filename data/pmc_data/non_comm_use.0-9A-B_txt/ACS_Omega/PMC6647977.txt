A catalytic
rocket stove was developed to reduce emissions and
improve efficiency compared to open cooking fires or traditional semienclosed
cookstoves, called poyos, typical of rural Guatemala. Traditional
stoves often emit particulate matter and carbon monoxide at sufficient
levels to cause respiratory illnesses and other health problems. Using
focus group results, the stove was tailored to the needs of Guatemalan
cooks. Field trial participants were provided with stove training
to ensure that stoves were operated correctly. Somewhat surprisingly,
the field trial demonstrated a high level of user acceptance in rural
Guatemala, where users cooked 93% of the time with the catalytic stove
despite having to change some cooking practices. In the field trial,
the stove reduced emissions by as much as 68% and improved fuel efficiency
by as much as 61% during real-world cooking events relative to the
traditional poyo. An additional qualitative portion of the field study
identified strengths and weaknesses of the stove that are being addressed
as part of an iterative design process.

1 Introduction
Nearly
2.5 billion people use biomass as their primary cooking
and heating fuel. Although renewable, biomass combustion is incomplete,
harming individual health, local air quality, and global climate change.
Burning biomass releases large amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5) that is responsible for 2.8 million deaths annually.1 Women and children, typically present during
food preparation, are disproportionally affected by indoor air pollutants.
Indoor air pollutants specifically lead to an increase in chronic
bronchitis, respiratory infections, and pneumonia.2 For instance, in Guatemala, where biomass is a common fuel,
respiratory diseases are the leading cause of death.3

Reducing indoor air pollutants requires a two-pronged
approach:
(1) developing clean burning technologies and (2) successful adoption
of those technologies by users. Clean cooking has benefitted from
the development of improved cookstoves (ICSs), distribution of cleaner
fuels (e.g., kerosene or liquid gas propane), and adoption of electric/solar
cooking. ICSs have been proven effective at improving indoor air quality
and have been studied extensively since 1968.4 Early work showed that small design changes can drastically alter
stove emissions.5−10 However, most households that adopt an ICS still have twice the
recommended levels of PM10.11

To meet emissions guidelines established by the World Health
Organization
(WHO), further improvements to ICS designs are needed. Meaningful
improvement in stove emissions beyond what has already been achieved
by ICSs could be realized by integrating oxidation catalysts, similar
to the technology path taken in the 1970s to reduce automotive emissions.
Typically, noble metal oxidation catalysts (e.g., platinum, palladium,
and rhodium) are used to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions; however,
these noble metal catalysts are prohibitively expensive for use in
ICSs. Metal oxides, which have been shown to reduce diesel soot emissions,
provide a promising and inexpensive alternative for use in ICSs.12−14 We recently showed that introducing an oxidation catalyst to a rocket
stove is capable of reducing PM and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions.15

Although developing a clean burning technology
is important, the
impact of the technology will be null without willing adoption of
the technology by local users. Often, cooks are resistant toward adopting
a new stove because of the strong traditions surrounding cooking as
a central cultural activity.16 Even when
an ICS is adopted within a home, the ICS typically is used in parallel
with an existing stove.17 ICSs are also
rarely as efficient upon adoption as they were in a laboratory setting.18 These issues highlight the need to tailor stoves
for a specific market so that local user preferences are considered.
With these questions in mind, a field trial of the new catalytic rocket
stove was performed in Guatemala to study real-world stove performance
and user acceptance.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Stove Efficiency and Emissions
Table 1 shows the emissions
performance of the catalytic stove group versus the poyo control group.
The nominal combustion efficiency (NCE), defined as the percentage
of carbon in the fuel converted to carbon dioxide, improved from 93.0
to 93.7%. In addition, emissions per unit of fuel energy consumed
decreased slightly. However, neither the increase in NCE nor the reduction
in fuel-specific emissions was statistically significant (p-values > 0.05). Using the stove also decreased CO2, CO, and PM emissions compared to the traditional poyo. Emissions
decreased 63–68% on a per minute basis and 52–59% on
a per standard adult (SA) meal basis; emissions reductions were found
to be significant based on p-value calculations.
Emissions calculated per unit heat (MJ) released from the fuel also
decreased 9–32%, but the improvement was not statistically
significant because of the sample size of the field trial. These results
suggest that although the stove burns more cleanly, much of the emissions
reductions were the result of fuel efficiency (percent of fuel-stored
energy transferred to the food as heat) rather than combustion efficiency
(percent of fuel carbon converted to CO2). The catalyst
was expected to improve combustion efficiency by promoting PM and
CO oxidation; however, nearly all of the catalytic monoliths broke
before emissions measurements could be taken. Because of small sample
size and the inherent noise in controlled cooking tests, a comparison
of emissions measurements with and without the catalyst present revealed
no statistically significant benefit of the catalyst (Supporting Information). However, previous laboratory
testing revealed that a catalyst-equipped stove is indeed effective
at reducing PM and CO emissions.15 Therefore,
replacing the ceramic monolith with a more durable metal monolith
would ensure that the catalyst remains intact within the stove and
should serve to further improve combustion efficiency and reduce PM
and CO emissions. It is noteworthy that, despite monolith fragility,
the stove maintained much of its efficiency when used by study participants,
suggesting that the prototype catalytic stove is easy to use and that
the stove training was effective.

In addition to reducing emissions, the stove significantly
improved
thermal efficiency compared to the traditional poyo (Table 2). The energy required to cook
a meal decreased by 53–61%, whether measured as average fire
power (i.e., stove heat generation rate), fuel energy per SA meal,
or fuel energy per cooking event. Similarly, the mass of fuel needed
to cook a meal also decreased 56–61% whether calculated per
cooking event or per SA meal. The efficiency of the stove directly
corresponds to the reduction in harmful emissions. In fact, the reduction
in emissions was largely caused by the reduction in fuel usage, as
any reduction in fuel-specific emissions (i.e., g/MJ) was fairly small
and not statistically significant. However, the 32% observed reduction
in fuel-specific PM emissions had a p-value of 0.10,
approaching the threshold for statistical significance. As such, a
larger sample set may be able to demonstrate a statistical reduction
in fuel-specific emissions. Statistical reductions in fuel-specific
emissions were observed in the more-controlled laboratory measurements
discussed in the next section. The stove efficiency is likely a direct
result of user willingness and ability to operate the stove as intended
and refrain from overloading the stove with fuel.

2.2 Field Trial Versus Laboratory Performance
In addition to the field trial, the catalytic stove was also evaluated
in a laboratory setting using the water boil test (WBT) 4.2.3 protocol.19Table 3 shows a comparison of the catalytic stove and a three-stone
fire, which is similar to poyos used in Guatemala. Baseline data for
a carefully tended three-stone fire using dry wood fuel were taken
from Jetter et al.20 These data were corrected
to a 45 min simmer phase as prescribed in WBT Version 4.2.3. Although
controlled cooking events measured during the field trial differ from
the WBT used in the laboratory, the two testing methods can be compared
indirectly. During a laboratory WBT, the catalytic stove reduced total
PM emissions by 77% compared to a three-stone fire. Similarly, in
the field trial, the catalytic cookstove reduced PM by 59% (per SA-meal
basis) when compared to the traditional poyo (Table 1). During a laboratory WBT, the catalytic
stove reduced specific energy consumption (kJ/L of water), a measure
of fuel usage, by 42% compared to a three-stone fire. For this comparison,
the specific energy consumption was preferred over mass-based fuel
usage metrics to account for any differences in the heating value
of the fuels between our study and that of Jetter et al. By comparison,
in the field trial, the catalytic stove reduced fuel consumption (MJ/SA-meal)
by 53% compared to a poyo (Table 2). Previous studies have also found that laboratory
testing often overestimates the emissions benefits of an ICS. For
example, Roden et al. found that field-measured PM emissions average
3 times the PM emissions measured in a laboratory.21 Despite the observed overestimation in PM reduction, laboratory
WBT results correctly predicted that the catalytic cookstove would
reduce emissions in a field setting with real-world cooking tasks.

Although laboratory testing successfully
predicted that the catalytic
stove would reduce emissions in a real-world situation, the stove
was slightly less effective in the field than in the laboratory. This
could be the result of user operation, fuel type, damage to the catalytic
monolith during the field trial, or a difference in performing a controlled
WBT versus a real-world cooking event. However, it is interesting
to note that the catalytic stove reduced high-power, fuel-specific
PM emissions by 54% compared to a three-stone fire. This reduction
in fuel-specific PM emissions was statistically significant (p-value < 0.05), whereas the analogous reduction in the
field trial was 32% with a p-value slightly above
the threshold for statistical significance. The laboratory results
demonstrated that the catalytic stove did decrease fuel-specific PM
emissions, and the observed emissions benefits were not merely a result
of increasing the thermal efficiency of the stove.

2.3 Indoor Air Quality
Although monitoring
emissions directly from the source is important for understanding
stove effectiveness, the primary goal of ICSs is to reduce the average
concentration of emissions within the home. Average pollutant concentrations
in the home depend not only on point-source emissions but also on
cooking frequency and ventilation. The guidelines for indoor air quality,
set by the WHO, are a 24 h CO average of 7 mg/m3 (6.11
ppm), a 15 min acute CO exposure of 100 mg/m3 (87.3 ppm),
and a 24 h PM average of 75 μg/m3.2 The indoor air quality of homes with and without the catalytic
stove was monitored using household air pollutant (HAP) meters built
specifically for this field trial that measured CO, CO2, and PM concentrations within the home and logged the data once
per second (for CO and CO2) or once per minute (for PM). Figure 1 shows that the stove
was able to significantly reduce 24 h averages within the home when
compared to the traditional poyo. CO concentrations were reduced by
67% from 9 to 3 ppm, whereas PM concentrations were reduced by 62%
from 310 to 120 μg/m3. On the basis of a two-tailed,
Student’s t-test, the observed reduction in
emissions was statistically significant, as the p-value was less than 0.05 for both CO and PM. These HAP measurements
match the results of direct sampling from the stove, which saw CO
and PM emissions reductions of 63–68% on a per minute basis
and 52–59% on a per SA meal basis. The reduction in CO concentration
was significant because the 24 h CO concentration was brought below
the 24 h WHO-recommended exposure limit. In regard to acute CO levels,
homes with a catalytic stove never saw CO concentration above 87 ppm,
demonstrating that the homes with the catalytic stove met all CO-related
guidelines. In contrast, all control homes experienced CO concentrations
greater than 87 ppm more than once. The 24 h PM average decreased
significantly as well but was still 38% higher than the recommended
limits. Of the homes with a catalytic stove, 9 days out of 29 (31%)
did not exceed the 75 μg/m3 limit, whereas in homes
without the stove, only 1 day out of 12 (8%) fell below the 75 μg/m3 limit.

Figure 1 Particulate matter and CO 24 h averages for the catalytic
stove
and the traditional Guatemalan poyo.

In addition to 24 h emissions averages, the average emissions
concentrations
for several individual cooking events were calculated in order to
establish the ability to extract emission factors (EF) from HAP data.
HAP meters are a potentially useful measurement tool, as they can
be left in a home to collect data without an observer, which helps
reduce potential bias caused by the observer effect. Three cooking
events, selected at random, from a random test home that used the
catalytic stove exclusively (to remove the influence of poyo emissions)
and three cooking events from a random control home were selected.
Cooking events in the home with the stove were significantly less
polluting than in the control home. Interestingly, the average CO
concentration in the home with the catalytic stove remained below
the WHO 24 h exposure guidelines despite being measured during cooking
events. Additionally, EF were calculated for PM and CO based on the
HAP measurements during the cooking event averages, as summarized
in Table 4. The EF
for both PM and CO were reduced when using the stove suggesting that,
while emissions reductions were primarily caused by reduced fuel consumption,
the catalytic stove also burned more cleanly than the poyo. The CO
and PM EF were also compared to results from laboratory WBTs and from
the field trial probe measurements. The EFPM,PROBE was
1.74 g/kg fuel, while the high-power EFPM,WBT was 0.96
g/kg-fuel. This was not unexpected, as cookstoves typically perform
better under controlled laboratory tests than in the field. The EFPM,HAP was 1.9 g/kg fuel, which is similar to the EFPM,PROBE. CO2 from respiration may have increased the indoor CO2 concentration and artificially depress the calculated EFPM,HAP. Nevertheless, the EFPM data from the HAP
meter agreed with the trends in the probe and WBT data and provided
confirmation of the PM reduction during a longer-term, unsupervised
experiment.

2.4 Stove Usage and Adoption
Figure 2 shows the result
of monitoring stove usage for 6 weeks following the emissions measurements.
Stove usage data (i.e., SUMS data) were collected without surveyor
visits to the home to reduce the observer effect that can bias observation-based
studies. The catalytic stoves saw heavy use during this time period,
largely replacing the traditional poyo. Poyo use declined 90% between
the control group and the test group in terms of both cooking events
per day and cooking time per day. In households with the catalytic
stove, the stove was used for 93% of cooking events and 89% of cooking
time rather than the traditional poyo. The amount of time spent cooking
per day was similar between the two groups. However, the number of
cooking events is slightly higher in the test group, implying that
a greater number of short cooking events were completed when using
the stove versus the traditional poyo. More numerous, shorter cooking
events can potentially limit the overall reduction in cooking emissions
because start-up and burn-out emissions often dominate total emissions.
Nevertheless, homes using the catalytic cookstove had lower PM and
CO concentrations, both in terms of 24 h averages and 15 min acute
averages.

per day and (B) time spent cooking per day. Error bars represent a
90% confidence interval for the mean value.

Overall, the stove demonstrated high usage in this community
with
a strong potential for participants to adopt the technology. The data
also confirmed user interviews that indicated that participants largely
replaced their traditional open fires or poyos with the stove. However,
the sample size of the current study is small and the duration was
short. Further assessments of usage and adoption across a larger subset
of people and over a longer time period will be needed to fully understand
the potential penetration of this particular catalytic rocket stove
in the eastern Guatemalan market.

2.5 General
User Perceptions
Initial
stove adoption and acceptance was high in all households, with users
expressing high levels of satisfaction and regular use 6 weeks after
dissemination. The stove displaced traditional poyos for most cooking
tasks, with cooking tortillas the notable exception. The primary perceived
attribute was stove power—the ability to cook quickly with
little firewood. Participants reported that the stove power made cooking
chores “light”, meaning that cooking was fast and used
little fuel.

Users referred to the catalytic stoves as a stove,
estufa in Spanish, rather than simply a fire or kitchen, as firewood
stoves are commonly denoted in Guatemala. The term estufa is usually
only used in reference to modern cooking devices (e.g., electric or
gas stoves) that replace traditional wood-fired devices. On the basis
of unpublished focus groups conducted by the authors in Guatemala
in 2015, our previous experiences with larger plancha stoves using
firewood suggest that users do not readily associate the term estufa
with plancha stoves. This parlance suggested that users perceived
the prototype stove as an advanced device in line with gas or electric
stoves.

All participants mentioned cooking speed as a noteworthy
feature
of the stove. A typical comment was “I like this stove
because it cooks fast”. These and other comments were
identified from thematic network analysis of participant interviews.
Time to cook beans and corn was specifically mentioned as being much
shorter with the test stove. Fast cooking times were valued not for
the time saved, but for the ability to quickly deliver food, that
is, “if my husband wants to go out to work quickly,
I cook fast and he can go work.” In addition to cooking
speed, users also reported decreasing firewood consumption by more
than half compared to an open poyo. Fuel savings were associated with
cooking speed rather than improved combustion; “[the
traditional open fires] constantly take firewood and the beans don’t
boil, while here just by putting two little pieces of firewood you
get the beans to boil fast.”

Participants reported
that firewood collection is burdensome and
time-consuming; “My God! When I collect firewood I
come back very late.” However, time is not a limiting
resource in the area, and participants rarely (2 of 8) associated
firewood savings with reduced personal drudgery. Stove fuel savings
were praised as a benefit to the community. In other words, firewood
was viewed as a noble resource that benefits all cooks and is a key
to survival; hence, preserving firewood resources is beneficial to
the community and not a primary benefit to the individual. Although
pleased with stove power, reduced cooking times, and fuel savings,
these were not seen as enough to motivate purchasing a stove priced
at 200 Quetzales (27 U.S. dollars). Willingness to pay for the stove
is an obstacle that would likely require subsided purchases for this
community that was living in or near extreme poverty (see Supporting Information for more pricing details).

Positive user response is no guarantee of long-term, sustained
adoption. Previous ICS programs have found that many people are reluctant
to adopt a new stove, and those that do often return to their previous
cooking methods.16 ICS usage often peaks
early after adoption, but usage declines until some steady-state point
is reached.17 For example, a study in Mexico
found that ICS usage reached 70% at 4 months after introduction before
falling to a steady 50% usage at 8 months.22 Therefore, it is important to look beyond user feedback, which can
often be overly positive and unreliable. In the short term, the SUMS
logged stove usage for 1.5 months after the field trial emissions
data were collected. Over this time period, the catalytic cookstove
was used more than 89% of the time. Additionally, our local partner
visited field trial participants 20 months after the field trial and
found that several of the original participants still used the catalytic
cookstove demonstrating some long-term adoption.

2.6 User Feedback on Stove Operation and Functionality
Participants found little difficulty in operating the stove; some
even found it easier to light than a traditional open fire; “you barely put any fuel and you already have a fire.”
Operating the stove required the use of smaller sticks than were typically
used in participants’ poyos. Similar studies had shown a reluctance
to change the size of firewood.16 However,
participants in the present study appeared to accept the need to switch
to smaller firewood, with three users explicitly mentioning this.
The ability to use smaller sticks and still deliver cooking power
was identified as a testament of the stove’s fire power.

An important aspect of the stove was the removable ash pan. Although
helpful to discard cooled char and ashes between stove uses, the ash
pan also ensured that airflow into the stove is not hindered by using
too much firewood. Removing the ash pan would allow a participant
to use large pieces of wood but would also harm stove efficiency.
However, because users were willing to switch to using smaller firewood,
no one removed the ash pan. In fact, users would regularly use the
ash pan to dispose of char/ash between cooking events.

A pot
skirt, which improved stove thermal efficiency in laboratory
testing, was provided to each participant. Only three households reported
regular pot skirt use. Those that used the pot skirt noted that it
improved stove power but was only helpful in specific cases. For example,
the pot skirt helped to cook corn, but not coffee, because the coffee
pot was too large. Two households specifically avoided using the pot
skirt to avoid handling the pot skirt while it was hot. Additionally,
users were surprised that portions of the stove were very hot to touch,
even though the stove radiated little heat. However, this was not
seen as a drawback and was actually anticipated to be beneficial during
hot summer months.

Participants in this study did not report
flavor changes compared
to the traditional open fire. In previous studies, participants, particularly
male members of the households, reported their preference for the
smoky flavor that wood cooking provides.23 A study by Lascurain23 conducted in Guatemala
hypothesized that firewood flavor was a mechanism for males to justify
and enforce the use of firewood over other fuels rather than something
they truly value. The fact that flavor has no impact in this type
of locality where people collect wood probably indicates that the
slight smoky flavor of firewood smoke is not relevant to users or
that the stove continues to provide that flavor.

Participants
reported that they were able to fulfill most cooking
tasks with the stove. Cooking beans and corn nixtamalization, typically
time-consuming processes, were found to be easy because of the fast
cooking speed. Quicker meals, such as stews, were also made with the
stove. However, tortilla cooking proved difficult with the stove.
Only three of the eight participants used the stove exclusively, whereas
the other five used open fires to cook tortillas. The small size of
the stove was the primary reason for using open fires to cook tortillas.
The stove could only accommodate two to three tortillas at a time,
whereas five to six could be made over an open fire accommodating
a larger comal. Increased capacity was especially important for larger
households. The small surface of the stove also breaks with the tradition
of communal tortilla baking, and women who baked communally continued
to use open fires. Tortillas are also cooked on clay comales, and
the stove was perceived to only heat the center of the comal, making
tortilla baking difficult. In addition, the stove was perceived as
unable to accommodate large pots used for special occasions, primarily
for stability reasons. Additional design feedback can be found in

Although
participants found the stove easy to use, the stove required
users to change their traditional cooking patterns. Previously, multiple
dishes were cooked simultaneously over a large open fire. Adopting
this stove required users to cook dishes sequentially. Users would
typically cover dishes or insulate them with a cloth to keep them
warm while another dish was prepared. The fact that households changed
their engrained simultaneous cooking habits in favor of the test stove
speaks to the acceptance of the stove in relation to traditional open
fires.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Catalytic Stove Design and Fabrication
An initial stove
prototype was built to test the effectiveness of
the catalytic converter and to optimize design considerations.15 Following the initial design, a focus group
was held in Santo Domingo Xenacoj, Guatemala (located in the highlands),
to gauge the response of potential stove users. The focus group consisted
of eight local women, was facilitated by a local partner, and began
with a demonstration of the catalytic stove. Conversation was directed
to answer specific questions but was allowed to be driven by the study
participants. The results of the focus group were used to make stove
design changes to accommodate Guatemalan cooking traditions. A key
change was to enlarge the fuel feed inlet to accommodate firewood
typically used in the Guatemalan highlands. The final stove design
is shown in Figure 3, and details regarding stove construction can be found in the Supporting Information.

3.2 Field Trial Location
The field trial
was conducted in southeastern Guatemala in the villages of Santa Barbara
and Paso del Credo in the municipality of Chiquimula. The location
was approximately 300 m above sea level with a dry, tropical climate.
The two participating villages were rural, and most residents were
living in near-extreme poverty. The trial was conducted in January
2017 when the average low temperature was 65 °F (18 °C)
and the average high temperature was 81 °F (27 °C). The
Chiquimula area was chosen because of the prevalence of small-wood
gathering, high use of open fires, and lack of liquefied petroleum
gas adoption. Although the wood in the field trial location (southeastern
lowlands) was smaller than the wood in the focus group location (highlands),
the larger fuel inlet that resulted from the focus group was seen
as a beneficial design change to broaden the potential user base.

Households in the field trial typically cooked over open or semienclosed
fires (poyos) built in a U-shaped hearth and located on the floor
(Figure 4). Hearths
were approximately 16 in. (41 cm) wide and 24 in. (61 cm) long. Household
diets consisted primarily of corn and beans. Diets were supplemented
with eggs, pasta, rice, stews, fruits, and occasionally meat. Corn
was consumed primarily as tortillas, which required boiling corn with
limewater, grinding the cooked corn, forming the resulting dough into
6 in. (15 cm) tortillas, and cooking over a hot griddle or comal.

3.3 Stove Dissemination and Training
Of the 15 all-female participants in the field study, 11 women were
given stoves, along with a pot skirt, pot, cast iron comal, and a
grill grate. The remaining four women participated as a control group
and cooked with their traditional poyos. Upon delivery of each stove,
participants received comprehensive training on how best to use the
stove. A native Guatemalan project member demonstrated the stoves
to two community leaders who were able to practice with the stoves
for a week before dissemination. With the help of the two community
leaders, the project member instructed participants on proper stove
usage and safety while two consecutive meals were cooked. Participants
had between 2 and 3 weeks to adapt to using the stove in their home
prior to in-home emissions testing.

3.4 Stove
Emissions Sampling and Monitoring
For each household, two
emissions sampling events were conducted
4 days apart. Each event consisted of an uncontrolled cooking event
where the participants were asked to prepare a meal without changing
their cooking techniques. A three-sided aluminum shield was placed
around the stove to minimize the effects of air currents. Carbon dioxide
(CO2), CO, and particulate matter (PM2.5) were
collected using a three-pronged stainless steel sampling probe placed
directly above the stove. CO2 was measured with a nondispersive
infrared (NDIR) sensor, CO with an electrochemical sensor, and PM
was measured gravimetrically. In addition, indoor concentrations of
CO, CO2, and PM2.5 were measured using wall-mounted
HAP meters sampling at 1 Hz for 4 days between the first and second
emissions sampling events. CO2 was measured via NDIR, CO
electrochemically, and PM via light scattering. Real-time CO2 HAP monitoring, which is uncommon in stove studies, allowed for
the calculation of HAP-based EF for CO and PM (see Supporting Information for details). Data were stored in a
separate data logger and all sensors were powered by a Li-ion battery.
In all homes, HAP meters were hung approximately 1 m laterally from
the stove combustion zone and 1.5 m above the floor. The location
was meant to approximate the breathing zone of a woman standing near
the stove. A picture of the experimental configuration and details
regarding the instruments can be found in the Supporting Information.

Emissions factors were determined
using the carbon balance approach, as has been done in previous studies
of stove emissions, and is described in the WBT 4.2.3 protocol.19 Flow rates, gas-phase emissions concentrations,
and sample volumes were adjusted for temperature and pressure. All
fuels provided by the stove user were weighed before and after the
cooking event. After the cooking event, partially consumed fuel and
ash/char were also weighed. The moisture content of fuel wood was
determined using an Extech M0210 moisture meter. Carbon and energy
characteristics of fuels were taken from the WBT 4.2.3 protocol.

In addition to measuring emissions, stove use monitors (SUMS) were
used to measure stove temperature and determine stove usage. The sensors
(iButton model DS1922T, Maxim) were attached to both traditional poyos
and the catalytic stoves. Stove temperature was logged every 10 min
for approximately 6 weeks. Temperature profiles were analyzed using
the Platform for Integrated Cookstoves Assessment (PICA, Berkeley
Air Monitoring Group) software machine learning algorithm to determine
the average frequency of cooking events per day and the total time
spent cooking per day for all stoves.

3.5 Participant
Interviews
Eight participants
were interviewed after using the stove for 6 weeks. Interviews were
used to assess user experience with the stove, perceived benefits
of the stove, suggested areas of improvement, and level of interest
regarding stove purchase. Semistructured interviews were conducted
over a 2-day period with 8 households, chosen randomly from among
the 11 households to receive the stove. An interview topic guide was
used to direct the general flow of interviews, but conversations were
adaptable based on the responses of stove users. User responses were
analyzed using thematic networks to identify and categorize relevant
themes.24
