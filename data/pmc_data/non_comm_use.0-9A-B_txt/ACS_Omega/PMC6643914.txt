Sodium-ion capacitors (SICs) have
gained great interest for mid-
to large-scale energy storage applications because of their high energy
and high power densities as well as long cycle life and low cost.
Herein, a T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles/N-doped graphene
hybrid anode (T-Nb2O5/NG) was prepared by solvothermal
treating a mixed ethanol solution of graphene oxide (GO), urea, and
NbCl5 at 180 °C for 12 h, followed by calcining at
700 °C for 2 h, in which T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
with average size of 17 nm were uniformly anchored on the surface
of the nitrogen-doped reduced GO because their growth and aggregation
were hindered, and also, the electronic conductivity and the active
sites of T-Nb2O5/NG were improved by doping
nitrogen. The T-Nb2O5/NG anode showed superior
rate capability (68 mA h g–1 even at 2 A g–1) and good cycling life (106 mA h g–1 at 0.2 A
g–1 for 200 cycles and 83 mA h g–1 at 1 A g–1 for 1000 cycles) and also showed high-rate
pseudocapacitive behavior from kinetics analysis. A novel SIC system
had been constructed by using the T-Nb2O5/NG
as anode and commercially activated carbon as the cathode; it delivered
an energy density of 40.5 W h kg–1 at a power density
of 100 W kg–1 and a long-term cycling stability
(capacity retention of 63% after 5000 consecutive cycles at a current
density of 1 A g–1) and showed a promising application
for highly efficient energy storage systems.

1 Introduction
Over
the past few decades, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
have successfully been utilized in portable electronics and they exhibit
significant potential applications in electronic equipment, hybrid
electric vehicles, stationary power stations, and smart grids in terms
of their high energy densities (150–300 W h kg–1) and satisfying life spans (500–1000 cycles).1−3 Nevertheless, the relatively slow power densities (<1000 W kg–1) restrict their large-scale applications in next-generation
high-power energy storage devices.4 In
contrast, supercapacitors (SCs) can deliver a high power density (>104
W kg–1) and outstanding cycle stability (104 to 105 cycles) because of utilizing highly reversible
ion adsorption/desorption on the electrode surface, while their energy
densities (<10 W h kg–1) are far from satisfactory.5 In view of the issues of current LIBs and SCs,
special hybrid energy storage devices that deliver both high energy
and power density and long-term cycling stability are highly desired
by combining the complementary features of both LIBs and SCs. In this
regard, the sodium ion capacitor (SIC) is regarded as one of the most
promising energy storage systems because it consists of a faradaic
sodium-ion battery anode and a capacitive SC cathode in a Na salt-containing
electrolyte and also because of the low cost of Na resources as well
as superior ionic conductivity of the solvated Na+ ions.6−9 In a SIC, the charges are simultaneously and asymmetrically stored/released
by anion adsorption/desorption on the surface of the nonfaradaic cathode
and via sodium ion intercalation/deintercalation into the anode.10 However, the differences in the charge storage
mechanism between the faradaic anode and capacitive cathode cause
kinetics imbalance because the sodium ion intercalation/deintercalation
process is much more sluggish than the electrical double layer upon
polarization at the electrode–electrolyte interface.11,12 To surmount the kinetics imbalance in SICs, great research efforts
have been made to introduce nanoarchitectured electrodes or explore
novel anode materials with pseudocapacitive behavior and sizeable
Na+ tunnels in the crystal structures to match suitable
cathode materials.3,13

Currently, commercial activated
carbon (AC) is commonly employed
as the capacitor cathode material because of its high specific surface
area, outstanding electronic conductivity, long cycle life, and low
cost.14 Insertion-type battery materials
with pseudocapacitive behavior are usually considered as promising
anode candidates for SICs because of their moderate reversible capacity,
rapid faradaic reaction, low volume variation, and stable structure
upon Na+ ion intercalation/deintercalation.15 In general, V2O5, Na2TiO3, NiCo2O4, TiO2, Na3V2(PO4)3, and conductive
MXene nanosheets can be used as the representative intercalation anodes;16−21 especially, orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5) has attracted tremendous attention as an anode material
for Na-ion batteries and SICs. Two obvious advantages make T-Nb2O5 a potential anode candidate; one advantage is
its large interplanar lattice spacing (3.9 Å), which allows for
fast Na+ ion diffusion and storage throughout the a–b plane, leading to a reversible
capacity of 200 mA h g–1 and outstanding rate capability,22 and another advantage is that T-Nb2O5 is found to show a rapid pseudocapacitive response
in the working potential range of 0.01–2 V (vs Na/Na+), which would be highly attractive for achieving synchronous high
energy density and power density.23 However,
both the intrinsic low electronic conductivity (≈3 × 10–6 S cm–1) and sluggish Na-ion diffusion
rate of T-Nb2O5 restrict its practical application
in hybrid devices.17 The intrinsic low
electronic conductivity of T-Nb2O5 can be improved
by integrating nanostructured T-Nb2O5 with various
carbon-based materials such as graphene or carbon nanotubes with large
surface area, superior electrical conductivity, high flexibility and
pronounced chemical stability, which are considered as outstanding
support materials for anchoring T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles.24 Meanwhile, the sodium storage property can be
enhanced by doping nitrogen into graphene because of the improved
electronic conductivity, enhanced surface wettability, and decreased
energy barriers for sodium ion penetration.25 Therefore, it is highly desirable to achieve a hybrid anode based
on T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles and nitrogen-doped
graphene (NG) for sodium-ion battery and SIC applications.

Herein,
a T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles/N-doped graphene
(T-Nb2O5/NG) hybrid anode was successfully prepared
by solvothermal treating a mixed ethanol solution of graphene oxide
(GO), urea, and NbCl5 at 180 °C for 12 h, followed
by calcining at 700 °C for 2 h. The T-Nb2O5/NG anode showed superior rate capability (68 mA h g–1 even at 2 A g–1) and good cycling life (106 mA
h g–1 at 0.2 A g–1 for 200 cycles
and 83 mA h g–1 at 1 A g–1 for
1000 cycles) and also showed high-rate pseudocapacitive behavior from
kinetics analysis. A novel SIC system had been constructed by using
T-Nb2O5/NG as the anode and commercially activated
carbon as the cathode; it delivered an energy density of 40.5 W h
kg–1 at a power density of 100 W kg–1 and long-term cycling stability (capacity retention of 63% after
5000 consecutive cycles at a current density of 1 A g–1) and showed a promising application for highly efficient energy
storage systems.

2 Results and Discussion
A schematic diagram to illustrate the synthetic procedure of the
T-Nb2O5/NG anode material is presented in Figure 1. First, Nb5+ ions were adsorbed onto the surface of GO nanosheets by electrostatic
attractive interaction and Nb5+–GO compound is obtained.
Second, the Nb5+–GO compound is solvothermally treated
under the assistance of urea; amorphous T-Nb2O5/NG is formed accompanied with the partial reduction of GO and nitrogen
doping into GO nanosheets for more defects, improving the dispersion
of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles.26 Third, the as-prepared amorphous T-Nb2O5/NG is further annealed at 700 °C for 2 h in an Ar atmosphere,
which improves the crystallinity of T-Nb2O5 and
further reduces GO, resulting in the final product T-Nb2O5/NG, in which T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
with average particle size of 17 nm are uniformly anchored on the
surface of the nitrogen-doped reduced GO.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration
of the synthesis procedure of the Nb2O5/NG compound.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is conducted
to investigate the crystallographic
structures of T-Nb2O5, T-Nb2O5/G, and T-Nb2O5/NG (Figure 2a). It can be seen that the
main diffraction peaks at around 22.6°, 28.3°, 28.9°,
36.5°, and 46.0° are observed for T-Nb2O5, corresponding to the (001), (180), (200), (181), and (002)
reflection planes of orthorhombic Nb2O5(T-Nb2O5) with the Pbam (55) space group
(JCPDS no. 30-0873). For T-Nb2O5/G and T-Nb2O5/NG compounds, their diffraction peaks match
well with those of T-Nb2O5, although the corresponding
diffraction peaks become weak and broad, suggesting that the crystallographic
structure of T-Nb2O5 is maintained. Moreover,
the diffraction peak at around 26° becomes broad because of the
disordered graphene nanosheets, which overlaps with the (041) plane
of T-Nb2O5.27 In
comparison with that of the T-Nb2O5/G compound,
the diffraction pattern of T-Nb2O5/NG shows
a negligible difference, suggesting that nitrogen doping has little
influence on the average size of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
and the structure of the reduced GO. The structures of T-Nb2O5, T-Nb2O5/G, and T-Nb2O5/NG compounds are further confirmed by Raman spectra
(Figure 2b). For all
compounds, the specific Raman vibration modes corresponding to the
vibrations of cations inside octahedra and tetrahedra and the stretching
Nb–O bonds center at 226, 315, and 689 cm–1, respectively, suggesting the existence of T-Nb2O5 phase.28 For T-Nb2O5/G and T-Nb2O5/NG compounds, a D band
located at 1350 cm–1 (sp3 defects originating
from disordered carbon) and a G band at 1587 cm–1 (sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon) are observed, suggesting
the existence of graphene. In addition, the ID/IG ratio slightly increases to
1.23 of T-Nb2O5/NG from 1.18 of T-Nb2O5/G, supporting that GO is further reduced and the sp3 defects increase after nitrogen doping, which is beneficial
for the improvement of electrochemical performance and diffusion of
Na+ ions.29,30 The contents of reduced GO in
T-Nb2O5/G and T-Nb2O5/NG
compounds determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are approximately
18 and 19 wt %, respectively (Figure S1).

Figure 2 XRD patterns (a) and Raman spectra (b) of pure Nb2O5, Nb2O5/G, and Nb2O5/NG compounds.

Field-emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) analyses are used to characterize the morphology
and the detailed microstructure of the pure T-Nb2O5, T-Nb2O5/G, and T-Nb2O5/NG compounds. The FE-SEM image of pure T-Nb2O5 shows that it is composed of agglomerated particles (Figure 3a). For T-Nb2O5/G and T-Nb2O5/NG compounds,
two obvious morphology characteristics are observed. One is that the
typical two-dimensional (2D) structure of graphene is well maintained
and another is that T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles are
anchored firmly on the surface of graphene without significant aggregation
in comparison with pure T-Nb2O5 (Figure 3b,c), suggesting that graphene
effectively hinders the growth and aggregation of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles.31 The size
distribution change of Nb2O5 nanoparticles is
shown in Figure S2 before and after nitrogen
doping. It can be seen that the average particle size of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles in pure T-Nb2O5 is about 129 nm (Figure S2a),
whereas it decreases to 30 nm for the Nb2O5/G
compound (Figure S2b) and 17 nm for the
Nb2O5/NG compound (Figure S2c). Moreover, T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
are uniformly dispersed on the surface of NG. These results suggest
that nitrogen doping plays a key role for the homogeneous dispersion
of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles on the graphene surface
and reduces the T-Nb2O5 particle size.32,33

images of Nb2O5 (a), Nb2O5/G (b), and Nb2O5/NG (c) and TEM
(d,e), HRTEM (f), and bright-field STEM image (g), with corresponding
EDXS elemental mappings of O (h), C (i), N (j), and Nb (k) of Nb2O5/NG.

The TEM images of T-Nb2O5/NG with different
resolutions further prove that T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
with particle size around 17 nm are uniformly anchored on the surface
of NG (Figure 3d,e).
Even if the T-Nb2O5/NG compound is ultrasonically
treated for 3 h, T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles are not
observed from the treated solution by TEM image analyses, suggesting
that the T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles do not fall off
from the surface of NG and a strong interaction force exists between
T-Nb2O5 and NG.34 The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image taken from one nanoparticle
reveals distinct lattice fringes with a crystal interplanar spacing
of 0.39 nm, corresponding to the (001) lattice plane of orthorhombic
Nb2O5 nanoparticles (Figure 3f).35 Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) elemental mappings of T-Nb2O5/NG compound are used to investigate the spatial element distribution.
The bright-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
image also shows that T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
are anchored the surface of NG nanosheets (Figure 3g). EDXS–STEM elemental mapping images
corresponding to the K-edge signals of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
niobium indicate that C, N, O, and Nb elements exist in the T-Nb2O5/NG compound and they are uniformly distributed
throughout the T-Nb2O5/NG compound, further
suggesting that the T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles are
uniformly anchored on the surface of NG and nitrogen is homogeneously
doped (Figure 3h–3k).
To analyze the nitrogen content in T-Nb2O5/NG,
EDXS analysis and CHN elemental analysis are carried out, and the
EDXS analysis result is shown in Figure S3. From the EDXS analysis result, it can be seen that C, N, Nb, and
O elements exist in T-Nb2O5/NG and the nitrogen
content is about 0.78 wt %; CHN elemental analysis also gives a similar
nitrogen content of 0.89 wt %.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurements are used to
determine the surface composition and chemical state of the as-obtained
products. The XPS survey spectrum of the T-Nb2O5/NG compound demonstrates the existence of C, O, Nb, and N elements
(Figure 4a). For pure
T-Nb2O5, the high-resolution XPS spectrum of
Nb 3d shows two major peaks at 210.5 and 207.7 eV corresponding to
the spin orbit doublet of Nb 3d3/2 and Nb 3d5/2, respectively, and the energy separation between Nb 3d3/2 and Nb 3d5/2 is 2.8 eV. The binding energy values agree
well with those of the reported Nb2O5, indicating
that a large number of Nb (V) ions exist in pure Nb2O5.36 The two major peaks at 210.5
and 207.7 eV corresponding to the spin orbit doublet of Nb 3d3/2 and Nb 3d5/2 show little change in T-Nb2O5/G, suggesting that T-Nb2O5 nanocrystals are maintained and the Nb-oxidation valence has not
changed after it is hybridized with graphene. However, the two major
peaks shift to lower band energies in the T-Nb2O5/NG compound while the energy separation between Nb 3d3/2 and Nb 3d5/2 is still 2.8 eV after graphene nanosheets
are doped with nitrogen elements, suggesting that the introduction
of the electron negative functional groups (especially pyridinic and
pyrrolic N) causes the migration of Nb electron cloud (Figure 4b).37 The C 1s XPS spectrum of T-Nb2O5/NG can be
deconvoluted into four peaks at 284.6, 285.4, 286.1, and 289.4 eV,
corresponding to C–C, C–O, C–N, and C=O
groups, respectively (Figure 4c),38 and the C–N bond peak
indicates the successful doping of the graphene structure with nitrogen.39 To further investigate the nitrogen doping behavior,
the N 1s XPS spectrum of T-Nb2O5/NG can also
be fitted and divided into three peaks at 395.5, 398.3, and 400.2
eV, which are assigned to pyridine-type N (52.9%), pyrrole-type N
(35.9%), and graphitic N (11.2%), respectively, suggesting that the
nitrogen atoms have been successfully doped into the graphene backbones
with urea by a solvothermal treating method (Figure 4d).40

The electrochemical performance
of T-Nb2O5, T-Nb2O5/G,
and T-Nb2O5/NG is first investigated by using
a 2032-type coin half-cell with
metallic sodium as the counter and reference electrodes. The cyclic
voltammetry (CV) curves of the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode
at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in the voltage rage
of 0.01–3.0 V versus Na/Na+ for the first three
cycles indicate that the first CV cycle curve shows a broad cathodic
peak at around 1.0 V; it is ascribed to the formation of a solid electrolyte
interphase (SEI) film and the decomposition of the organic electrolyte.
For the second and third cycles, the CV curves are well overlapped,
suggesting the good reversibility of the sodiation and desodiation
process in the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode. In addition,
no obvious redox peak is observed after the first cycle, suggesting
the dominant pseudocapacitance behavior (Figure 5a).41 Moreover,
its galvanostatic charge–discharge curves in the voltage range
of 0.01–3.0 V versus Na/Na+ at a current density
of 0.05 A g–1 for the first three cycles show that
the first discharge and charge capacities based on the total mass
of T-Nb2O5/NG electrode are 352 and 126 mA h
g–1, respectively, with a low initial Coulombic
efficiency of 36% (Figure 5b), which is mainly ascribed to the formation of a SEI film
on the electrode surface and irreversible side reactions/ion trappings
inside nanostructured electrodes.3,42 In comparison
with pure T-Nb2O5 and T-Nb2O5/G electrodes, T-Nb2O5/NG electrode
shows better rate capability at different current densities ranging
from 0.05 to 2 A g–1, and its discharge capacities
at the current densities of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1, and 2 A g–1 with 10 cycles are 137, 129, 108, 101, 92, 86, and
64 mA h g–1, respectively (Figure 5c). When the current density recovers to
0.1 A g–1 after cycling at different rates, the
discharge capacity could swiftly return to 123 mA h g–1, suggesting good reversibility in the sodium intercalation and deintercalation
process. At the same time, the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode
also shows good cycling performance in comparison with that of T-Nb2O5 and T-Nb2O5/G electrodes;
its specific capacity decreases from 123 to 105 mA h g–1 after 200 cycles at the current density of 0.2 A g–1 (Figure 5d). The
specific capacity is not only larger than those of the pure T-Nb2O5 (16 mA h g–1) and T-Nb2O5/G (78 mA h g–1) because of
the improvement of the electronic conductivity, nanoparticle aggregation,
and structural damage from pure T-Nb2O5 but
also higher than those of previously reported other Nb2O5 nanomaterial electrodes.43,44 At 1 A g–1 for 1000 cycles, the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode still delivers a discharge capacity of 76 mA h g–1 with a high Coulombic efficiency near 100% during
the long cycle (Figure 5e), suggesting that it possesses excellent long cycling performance.
The capacity increase in the initial cycles can be ascribed to the
activation of electrode materials.45−47 As the cycle number
increases, more active sites have been activated and they participated
in the sodium-ion storage, increasing the final capacity. The charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) of the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode after 100 cycles at 1 A g–1 is smaller than those of pure T-Nb2O5 and
T-Nb2O5/G electrodes, which is confirmed in
the semicircle at the high-frequency region, indicating that the graphene
introduction and nitrogen doping enhance the electronic conductivity
of the as-prepared electrode (Figure 5f).

To further explain the excellent
sodium storage performance of
the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode, electrochemical kinetics
analyses are carried out, and the analyses results are shown in Figure 6. It can be seen
that its CV curves gradually exhibit obvious distortion, and the cathodic
peaks at around 0.4 V gradually appear as the scan rate increases
(Figure 6a), suggesting
that electrochemical polarization occurs in the electrodes.48 In general, the measured peak currents (i) and scan rates (v) obey the power-law
relationship: i = avb, where a and b both are alterable constants and the b value can
be determined by the slope of the log(i) versus log(v) plot, which reflects the types of the charge storage
mechanism.49 Specifically, the b value of 0.5 indicates an ideally diffusion-controlled
process caused by Na+ intercalation, whereas 1 represents
an ideally capacitive-controlled behavior via a surface faradaic redox
reaction.50 For the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode, the b values corresponding
to cathodic and anodic peaks are 0.88 and 0.94 at the scan rates between
0.1 and 8 mV s–1 (Figure 6b), respectively, indicating that the electrochemical
kinetics is mainly controlled from surface capacitance. Also the capacitance
ratios from both surface and diffusion contribution are analyzed,
and they can be quantitatively separated according to the equation: i = k1v + k2v1/2, where i is the current at a fixed potential, v is the scan rate during CV tests, and k1 and k2 are constants. k1v represents the surface capacitive
effects, whereas k2v1/2 stands for the diffusion-controlled intercalation process.51−53 The capacitive-controlled contribution is 87% for the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode at a scan rate of 8 mV s–1; it is illustrated by the green region (Figure 6c). At different scan rates, the contribution
ratios for two different processes are also determined. It can be
seen that the capacitive contribution from the total charge storage
gradually increases from 46 to 87% as the scan rate increases from
0.1 to 8 mV s–1 (Figure 6d). This result indicates that its capacity
is mainly attributed to pseudocapacitance at high scan rates, and
it is characterized by the fast electrochemical kinetics for the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode.

at a scan rate of 8 mV s–1 (c), and contribution
ratio of capacitive (green) and diffusion-controlled (gray) capacity

For evaluating the device performance
from assembling the as-prepared
T-Nb2O5/NG compound, an AC electrode is selected
as the cathode, and its electrochemical performance is also tested
in a Na half-cell over a potential range of 3.0–4.5 V versus
Na/Na+ with metallic sodium as both the counter and the
reference electrodes. It can be seen that a quasi-rectangular CV curve
at a scan rate of 1 mV s–1 and linear galvanostatic
charge–discharge curves at a current density of 0.05 A g–1 demonstrate an electric double-layer capacitive behavior
with the adsorption/desorption of ions on the surface.54 The specific capacity at 0.05 A g–1 is estimated to be about 46 mA h g–1, with excellent
rate capability at various current densities from 0.05 to 1 A g–1 and good cycling stability at 0.2 A g–1 (≈95% after 200 cycles) (Figure S4). By using T-Nb2O5/NG as the anode and commercial
AC as the cathode in NaClO4-based organic electrolyte and
by using a mass ratio of 1:5 for anode to cathode in terms of the
charge balance, a prototype full-cell SIC is assembled. Before the
SIC is assembled, the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode is
preactivated for five cycles at 0.05 A g–1 in a
Na half-cell and then sodiated to 0.01 V versus Na/Na+.
The CV curves and the charge–discharge profiles for the assembled
device are shown in Figure 7. The near-rectangular CV curves (Figure 7a) and the symmetric linear charge–discharge
profiles (Figure 7b)
suggest a typical capacitive behavior for the assembled T-Nb2O5/NG//AC full-cell.55 According
to the charge/discharge curves, the energy and power densities based
on the total mass of both anode and cathode active materials of the
SIC full-cell at different current densities are calculated. The as-assembled
SIC full-cell delivers a maximum energy density of 40.5 W h kg–1 at a power density of 100 W kg–1 (Figure 7c), which
is larger than those of several representative capacitors, such as
Nb2O5@graphene//AC,56 CNT/Nb2O5//AC,57 TiO2-B//AC,58 V2O5//BP,59 AC//AC,60 ZDC//P2-NCM,61 PB//AC,62 and Na-TNT//AC.63 Furthermore, the T-Nb2O5/NG//AC SIC also exhibits
a good cycle stability with the capacity retention of about 67% after
5000 consecutive cycles at a current density of 1 A g–1 and excellent Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% during the cycles
(Figure 7d). The remarkable
electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the following features.
At first, graphene with the typical 2D structure improves the conductivity
of the as-prepared materials. Second, graphene effectively hinders
the growth and aggregation of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
and provides a good load surface for Nb2O5 nanoparticles,
making T-Nb2O5 with particle size around 17
nm uniformly disperse and anchor firmly on the surface of graphene
and offering a large electrochemically active surface area for a fast
and reversible faradaic reaction. Third, nitrogen doping on the graphene
surface is favorable for the homogeneous dispersion of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a T-Nb2O5/NG hybrid anode is
prepared by solvothermal treating a mixed ethanol solution of GO,
urea, and NbCl5 at 180 °C for 12 h, followed by calcining
at 700 °C for 2 h. Graphene and nitrogen doping on the graphene
surface effectively hinder the growth and aggregation of T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles and provide a good load surface
for Nb2O5 nanoparticles, making T-Nb2O5 with particle size around 17 nm uniformly disperse
and anchor firmly on the surface of graphene and offering a large
electrochemically active surface area for a fast and reversible faradaic
reaction. The majority charge storage in the T-Nb2O5/NG anode is dominated by a pseudocapacitive process at high
rate, demonstrating its superior rate capability and good cycling
life. A novel SIC system assembled by using T-Nb2O5/NG as the anode and AC as the cathode delivers an energy
density of 40.5 W h kg–1 at a power density of 100
W kg–1 and a good cycle stability with 67% capacity
retention after 5000 cycles of charge–discharge at 1 A g–1. This work provides a novel route for developing
high-energy/power SICs as one of the next-generation energy storage
system.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Material
Preparation
All chemical
reagents used in this experiment were of analytical grade and used
without any further purification. GO and AC were purchased from Nanjing
XFNANO Material Technology Company Limited.

4.1.1 Preparation
of the T-Nb2O5 Nanoparticles/N-Doped Graphene
(T-Nb2O5/NG) Hybrid Anode
GO was first
prepared from natural graphite
flakes according to a modified Hummer’s method as reported
elsewhere.64 In a typical preparation of
T-Nb2O5/NG, 0.1 g of as-prepared GO powder was
well dispersed in 30 mL of ethanol by ultrasonic treatment for 6 h
and GO suspension (3 mg mL–1) was obtained. NbCl5 powder (0.5 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of ethanol in another
vessel and stirred for 1 h and a uniform and pellucid NbCl5 ethanol solution was prepared. After slowly dropping NbCl5 ethanol solution into the GO suspension and after continuously stirring
for 6 h, 0.8 g of urea was added into the above mixture and stirred
for another 2 h. The final mixed suspension was transferred into a
100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 180 °C
for 12 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the resultant
black product was collected by centrifugation, rinsed with deionized
water and ethanol for removing the impure ions, and then, it was freeze-dried
overnight. The obtained sample was annealed at 700 °C for 2 h
in an Ar atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 °C min–1 and the T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles/N-doped graphene
(T-Nb2O5/NG) hybrid anode was finally prepared.
For comparison, the T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles anchored
on graphene (T-Nb2O5/G) were obtained except
the addition of urea, and pure T-Nb2O5 nanoparticles
were prepared without the addition of urea and GO via the same preparation
procedure as for the T-Nb2O5/NG hybrid anode.

4.2 Material Characterization
The XRD
patterns were obtained from a D/Max2550VB+/PC diffractometer with
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), and the operation
voltage and current were maintained at 40 kV and 100 mA, respectively.
The FE-SEM images were acquired with a SU8020 field emission scanning
electron microscope. The TEM images and HRTEM patterns were acquired
using a JEM-2800 field-emission transmission electron microscope operated
at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Elemental mappings images were
collected by using a Gatan GIF Quantum 965 instrument. The Raman scattering
spectra were determined on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer
with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm. TGA was carried out on a
Q1000DSCLNCSFACS Q600SDT under air atmosphere with a heating rate
of 10 °C min–1 from room temperature to 800
°C. The XPS spectra were obtained with AXIS ULTRA using Al Kα
radiation (1486.6 eV) as an excitation source. The binding energy
was corrected using the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. N content was analyzed
with a Vario EL III element analyzer.

4.3 Electrochemical
Measurements
T-Nb2O5, T-Nb2O5/G, and T-Nb2O5/NG electrodes
were prepared by pasting slurries
containing 80 wt % active materials, 10 wt % super-P carbon black,
and 10 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone
(NMP) onto 10 μm thick copper foils via a doctor-blade casting
method. The AC electrode was prepared by pasting slurries containing
90 wt % AC, 5 wt % polyvinylidene fluoride, and 5 wt % super P conductive
carbon black in NMP onto 15 μm thick aluminum foils via the
doctor-blade casting method. The laminates were then punched into
circular discs with a diameter of 1.4 cm and thoroughly dried under
vacuum at 110 °C for 12 h prior to use, and the average active
mass loading was typically controlled at 1.5–2.0 mg cm–2 in all electrodes.

Electrochemical measurements
were conducted using CR2032-type coin cells assembled in an Ar-filled
glovebox with both moisture and oxygen levels less than 0.1 ppm. Home-made
sodium foil served as the counter electrode and a Whatman GF/D glass
microfiber filter paper was utilized as the separator, and the electrolyte
was a solution of 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl
carbonate containing 5 wt % fluoro ethylene carbonate (EC/DMC + 5
wt % FEC, volume ratio of EC/DMC = 1:1). CV tests at various scan
rates from 0.1 to 20 mV s–1 in the voltage range
of 0.01–3.0 V versus Na/Na+ and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy tests by sweeping the frequency from 105 to 10–2 Hz under ac stimulus with 5 mV
amplitude were carried out with a CHI660E electrochemical work station.
Galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements were performed
on a Land CT2001A multichannel battery testing system between 0.01
and 3 V versus Na/Na+ at different current densities at
room temperature. Before constructing the SIC full-cells, the T-Nb2O5/NG electrode was preactivated five times at
0.05 A g–1 in a Na half-cell and then sodiated to
0.01 V versus Na/Na+. A SIC full cell was constructed by
using T-Nb2O5/NG as the anode and AC as the
cathode with an active material weight ratio of 1:5 in the voltage
range of 1.0–3.0 V. The AC cells were assembled by the same
method as mentioned above. In SIC full-cell tests, the current densities
were based on the total mass of both active anode and cathode materials.
The energy and power densities of the SIC full-cells were calculated
by numerically integrating the galvanostatic discharge curves using
the equations: E = 1/2 × C ×
ΔV2, P = E/Δt, where C is
the mass specific capacitance (F g–1), ΔV is the working potential (V), Δt is the discharge time (s), E is the energy density,
and P is the mass power density.
