This paper presents a simple and
highly efficient method for dopamine
detection using water-soluble carbon dot nanoparticles. The ZnO-associated
carbon dots (CDZs) were synthesized using a green chemical strategy.
An examination of the effects of biomolecules on the fluorescence
of CDZs revealed selective dopamine-induced quenching. In a phosphate
buffer (pH = 7.4) medium, a detection limit of 1.06 nM was obtained.
This “turn off” phenomenon was attributed to the electronic
interaction between CDZs and dopamine, during the oxidation of dopamine.
At lower pH, however, the effects of dopamine on the fluorescence
of CDZs were insignificant as the oxidation of dopamine was hindered
when the proton concentration was increased. This method was found
to be free from the interference of coexisting molecules, that is,
ascorbic acid and uric acid. This sensing platform was applied successfully
in biological fluids to confirm the practical significance of the
as-designed sensor.

Introduction
Dopamine (DA) is a
vital catecholamine neurotransmitter that acts
within the brain and central nervous system. DA plays an important
role over a wide range of physiological processes. An imbalance of
DA in the systems would cause severe diseases, including schizophrenia,1 Parkinson’s disease,2 and depression.3 DA also affects
the blood pressure, construction of heart muscles, and renal systems.
The detection of DA is clinically very important. The DA metabolism
follows two pathways: homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
acid pathways. The biological functions in the human body depend on
the HVA concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid containing cellular
information and biochemicals that are favorable for brain activation.4 This makes DA very important in neurosystems.5

DA is a clinically crucial compound; its
accurate detection has
become a major topic of interest. Since the past, different techniques
have been adopted to achieve the sensitive detection of DA, including
electrochemical,6−9 fluorometric,10−14 colorimetric,15,16 voltametric,17 and chromatographic.18 Among
them, the fluorometric detection of DA showed better results for its
high signal to noise ratio, good reproducibility, low cost, and easy
removal of the interference of coexisting biomolecules.19

Fluorescent nanomaterials, namely, quantum
dots (QDs), metal nanoclusters
(MNCs), and carbon dots (CDs), are important fluorescent probes that
can be used to detect DA.6,11,12 QDs (with cadmium and selenium) and MNCs (gold and silver nanoclusters)
are often associated with synthetic complications and significant
cytotoxicity. CDs have emerged as an efficient probe owing to their
unique properties, including their small and well-defined sizes, biocompatibility,
low cytotoxicity, water solubility, tunable photoluminescence, and
good stability against photobleaching.20 Owing to their unique physico-chemical properties, CDs are often
successfully utilized for chemical as well as bio-sensing, catalysis,
electrocatalysis, optoelectronic devices, environmental applications,
and biomedical applications.21 The facile
electron acceptance/donation properties of CDs were used to design
CD-based sensors.21 The sensing process
takes place through different photophysical processes, including photoinduced
electron transfer, intramolecular charge transfer, twisted intramolecular
charge transfer, metal–ligand charge transfer, electronic energy
transfer, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer.22 Generally, these processes involve intermolecular interactions
between the sensor and analyte.

In recent days, CD–metal/metal
hydroxide (CDM/CDMO) have
gained significant importance in different fields of sensing, photocatalysis,
and photovoltaics.23−25 The CDM/CDMO-based sensors have better efficiency
than those of pure metal or metal oxide-based nanoparticles because
of the introduction of properties, including the change in conductance,
increasing surface reaction sites, high porosity, and contact potential
at the junction of two components.26 Previous
reports of CDMO hybrids encouraged the use of hybrid materials for
different sensing. Some notable works include the CD–MnO2-based glutathione sensor designed by Wang et al.,27 CD–Au nanocomposite-based cysteine detector
by Deng et al.,28 and CD–MnO2-based N-acetyl-l-cysteine sensor
by Jana et al.29

In this study, a
fluorometric DA sensor utilizing CD, as a probe,
was designed. Citric acid (CA) and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) are
used as carbon and hetero atom (nitrogen atom) sources, respectively,
for the synthesis of CDs. ZnO serves as a surface-passivating agent
and provides stability to the CDs by preventing aggregation.30 ZnO attaches preferentially to the amine group
on the CDs.31 The electronic interaction
within ZnO and CDs influences radiative recombination in carbon tuning
its opto-electronic properties. Upon excitation, the electrons at
the valence band might be excited to the conduction band leaving holes
in the valence band. The generated excited electrons can transfer
to the carbon layer,31 tuning the inherent
radiative recombination within the CD. On the other hand, the photoelectron,
generated upon excitation in the ZnO moiety, could be used to interact
with the external analyte present in the medium. In the present experiment,
the intriguing fluorescence of ZnO-associated CDs (CDZs) was quenched
in the presence of DA. The detection limit was as low as 1.06 nM.
The selectivity of DA in the presence of other coexisting biomolecules
can be attributed to the electronic involvement of as-synthesized
CDZs into DA oxidation. The good compatibility of highly selective
detection on DA in a biological fluid sample highlights the potential
of the as-synthesized CDZs for DA detection in biomedical fields.

Results
and Discussion
Physical Characterization of CDZs
Figure 1A presents
a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of the as-synthesized CDZs. The CDZ particles
had a mean diameter of 1.65 nm. Close observations with high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) analysis showed crystallinity with lattice fringes of
0.23 and 0.19 nm that corresponded to the (100) plane of carbon32 and the (102) plane of ZnO,33 respectively (Figure 1B). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern in Figure 1C showed only one
broad peak at approximately 22° 2θ that corresponds to
the graphitic carbon peak.34 Besides, a
tiny peak at 72.9° was observed that can be attributed to the
(004) plane of ZnO, DB card: 01-080-0075. Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were
carried out to study the chemical composition and functional groups
of the CDZ particles. As depicted by the FTIR spectrum in Figure 1D, the peaks at 3456,
2912, 1649, 1230, and 1037 cm–1 corresponds to the
stretching vibration of N–H, asymmetric stretching vibration
of CH2, stretching vibration of C=C/C=O,
and stretching vibration of C–O, respectively.35 The attachment of ZnO with the ex situ prepared CD particles was examined through FTIR studies. In another
set of experiments, the hydrothermal treatment of zinc acetate dihydrate
was performed in the absence of CDs (prepared via microwave treatment). Figure S1 shows a comparative FTIR for normal
CD, ZnO, and CDZs. It was observed that for CDZs and ZnO a weak peak
appeared at ∼900 cm–1 which corresponds to
Zn–O stretching.36 This peak was
absent for CD indicating association of ZnO with CD. The XPS spectrum
in Figure 2 shows that
the CDZs comprised carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and zinc. The high resolution
XPS spectra of C 1s could be resolved into four peaks with binding
energies at 284.04, 284.97, 288.33, and 291.38 eV, corresponding to
C=C, C–C, C–N, and C–O, respectively.
The N 1s spectrum was fitted to two peaks at 399.36 and 401.15 eV,
which were assigned to N–C and N–H bonds, respectively.
Deconvolution of the O 1s peak gives three components at 530.66, 531.64,
and 532.7 eV for O–Zn, HO–, and O–C bonds, respectively.
Fitting of the Zn 2p spectrum provided two main bands at 1021.56 and
1044.65 eV, which were assigned to Zn 2p3/237 and Zn 2p1/2 of ZnO, respectively.
The above analysis indicated that the as-synthesized CDZ particles
might have functional groups, such as −NH2, −COOH,
and ZnO, that might be associated with the carbonized entity. The
stability of CDZs was examined with respect to the emission intensity
and emission peak over a period of 60 days (Figure S2). The results suggested the long-term stability and usability
of CDZs.

vacuum dried for analysis.

Optical Characterization of CDZs
The UV–vis
absorption spectrum revealed two distinct peaks at 266 and 362 nm,
which were assigned to the π–π* transition of the
aromatic C=C bond and n−π* transition of the C=O
bond, respectively38 (Figure 3). The CDZ aqueous solution
emitted strong blue light under a UV irradiation of 365 nm. While
excited at 340 nm, CDZs showed very strong fluorescence with an emission
maximum of 440 nm. The fluorescent quantum yield was calculated to
be 25.96% (reference: quinine sulfate). The lifetime was calculated
to be 12.46 ns from the fluorescence decay profile (Figure S3). The fluorescence excitation spectrum of the CDZ,
with an emission maximum at 440 nm, exhibited a broad peak with a
maximum at approximately 344 nm. When the excitation wavelength was
increased from 320 to 600 nm in 20 nm increments, the spectra exhibited
excitation wavelength-dependent behavior, along with a red shift of
the emission peak with an increasing excitation wavelength (Figure S3).39 This
tunable fluorescence of CDZ particles may arise from the different
sizes or the existence of different emissive sites on the surfaces
of the CDs.40,41 On the other hand, the precise
mechanism of this excitation wavelength-dependent tunable emission
of CDs requires further study. The emission of CDZs depends on the
pH of the medium. Figure S4 shows a blue
shift of the CDZ emission peak with increasing pH. Furthermore, the
fluorescence spectra of CDZs were examined in the presence of NaCl
solutions of different concentrations to check the stability of CDZs
under high ionic strength. The results showed no significant alteration
of the fluorescence nature of CDZs (Figure S5), suggesting that CDZs have excellent stability under high ionic
strength conditions.

at 266
and 362 nm; red line: emission spectra at excitation wavelength of
340 nm; blue line: excitation spectra at an emission wavelength at
440 nm.

Fluorescence Quenching
of CDZs
The effect of fluorescence
response behavior of CDZs toward various biomolecules [ascorbic acid
(AA), citric acid(CA), cysteine (Cys), dopamine (DA), fructose (Fru),
glucose (Glu), sucrose (Suc), and uric acid (UA)] was investigated.
As shown in Figure 4, almost no other molecules except for DA caused significant changes
in the CDZ emission. This paves the way for selective DA detection.
DA itself is fluorescent that shows emission at an excitation wavelength
of 270 nm. The emission changed in the presence of CDZs. The simultaneous
changes in the CDZ and DA emission, upon mixing, indicates electronic
interactions between the moieties.13 CDZs
are believed to interact with DA during oxidation to its quinone derivative.
XPS of the CDZ–DA system revealed a shift in the C 1s and N
1s peaks (Figure S6). Deconvolution of
the C 1s peak provided peaks at 284.5, 285.5, 287.9, and 288.9 eV,
corresponding to C=C, C–C, C–O/C–N, and
C=O bonds, respectively. This may be due to the partial shift
in the electron density during participation in DA oxidation. The
C=O bond became prominent possibly because of evolution of
the keto group in the CDZ–DQ system. Similarly, the sp3/sp2 ratio increased in the system causing a shift
of the C–C and C=C peaks toward a higher binding energy.42 For N 1s, the peak at 399.3 eV for N–C
remained unaltered, but a new small peak at 398.1 eV was observed.
This may correspond to =N–/–NH2 generated
during the reaction process. On the other hand, the Zn 2p peak remained
unaltered. Such behavior can be explained by the catalytic activity
of the ZnO moiety during reduction.43 ZnO
might have interacted with the −OH group of DA, causing the
activation of the group and facile electron transfer.44Figure 4 shows that in absorption spectra the ∼266 nm peak of CDZs
suffered an enhancement along with the red shift. The CDZ absorption
peak at 362 nm remained almost unaltered. This phenomenon might be
explained considering the absorption of AA,45 oxidized DA,46 and UA47 which became prominent along with CDZ absorption under
present experimental conditions. The pH of the medium is a crucial
factor for biosensing. Therefore, the effect of DA on the emission
of CDZs was examined at different pH from 2 to 10 (Figure 5). The fluorescence intensity
of CDZs decreased gradually in the presence of DA at higher pH. DA-induced
quenching was attributed to the engagement of CDZs in the oxidation
of DA. As in alkaline media, DA could be oxidized rapidly to its quinone
derivative,48 and the DA-induced fluorescence
quenching of CDZs became more prominent. Nevertheless, the sensitivity
of DA was examined in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) medium so
that the sensor can be used in a biological environment.

Determination of DA with CDZs as a Fluorescent
Probe
The selective quenching of CDZ fluorescence by DA was
used for the
quantitative detection of DA. This concentration dependence was examined
in PBS (pH = 7.4). Figure 6 presents the DA concentration-dependent fluorescence of CDZs.
The fluorescence of CDZs decreased with increasing DA concentration.
The relative fluorescence intensity (I0/I, I = fluorescence intensity
of CDZs in the absence of DA, and I = fluorescence
intensity pf CDZs in the presence of DA) at 440 nm as a function of
the DA concentration, [DA], was calculated over the concentration
range, 18 nM to 1.2 mM. The quenching mechanism of a fluorophore is
described using a Stern–Volmer plot as follows 1  where Q is the quencher and KSV is the Stern–Volmer
constant. The
linearity of the plot depends on the quenching mechanism.49 From the plot, a linear relationship between
the relative fluorescence intensity and [DA] was obtained over a concentration
range of 180 nM to 15 μM (R2 = 0.98).
The lower detection limit was calculated to be 1.06 nM (signal/noise
= 3). This makes the CDZ a very sensitive probe for DA detection.

vs the concentration of DA (inset: linear dependence of the relative
fluorescence intensity with the concentration of DA). λex = 340 nm, I0 and I denote the fluorescence intensity of CDZs in the absence and presence
of biomolecules, respectively.

Study on Interference during the Sensing Process
Because
CDZs are intended for use in the detection of DA, the interference
study was done using other molecules that may coexist with DA in a
cell. The effect of biomolecules (AA, CA, Cys, Fru, Glu, Suc, and
UA) and some metal ions (Na+, K+, and Zn2+) on the emission of the CDZ–DA system was recorded. Figure 7 shows that at a
1:1 ratio of other moieties and DA, there is no significant change
in the emission of the CDZ–DA system. The PBS medium was used
for these experiments at room temperature. Compared to previous reports
(Table S1), this prescribed method showed
a significantly important detection limit of DA.

of other moieties. λex = 340 nm, [CDZ] = 0.005 g/mL,

Determination of DA in Spiked Biological
Systems
The
as-designed sensing platform in the biological fluid, where DA, AA,
and UA can coexist, was performed on human blood samples. The blood
sample was collected from a healthy donor and centrifuged to remove
the heavy particles. A dilution of 2000 gave significant % recovery
(Table 1). The % recovery
and % RSD highlight the efficiency of the CDZ sensor (Table 2).

A quick survey of DA sensing in cells was performed using HeLa
cells. Illumination of the cells containing CDZ particles at 405 nm
exhibited a blue emission from the cytoplasm area. The nucleus was
not stained by DAPI; the emission was solely from the CDZ particles.
When DA was introduced into the cells, the CDZ-induced emission in
the cell was found to be less intense (Figure 8). Nevertheless, further experimentation
with the dosage and cellular interaction mechanism will be needed.

CDZs and (B) CDZ–DA illuminated at 405 nm. Scale bar 50 μm.

Interaction of CDZs with BioMolecules at
Lower pH
In
a parallel experiment, while checking the effects of biomolecules
on the fluorescence of CDZs at different medium pH, CA was found to
quench the CDZ emission at lower pH (Figure 9), whereas DA did not show any effect. This
“turn off” phenomenon may be because of the CA–CDZ
interaction. Further investigation showed that at pH = 2, the CA-induced
quenching predominated showing a linear relationship between the relative
fluorescence intensity and the CA concentration over the range, 5
μM to 1 mM (Figure 10). This simple fluorometric CA sensing platform has significant
potential because CA is an important ingredient for different food
and soft drink beverages.50 Therefore,
a fluorescent probe, that can be used for multisensing by tuning the
medium pH, was synthesized.

Conclusions
A
ZnO-associated amine-functionalized CD was designed for the selective
and sensitive detection of DA. The sensing performance of the as-synthesized
CDZ was evaluated through a fluorescence “turn off”
phenomenon. The quenching was attributed to the oxidation of DA in
the presence of CD particles. The prescribed sensor achieved a nanomolar
detection limit in the PBS medium. The applicability of the sensor
was checked using a DA-spiked human blood sample with reasonable RSD
values. The medium pH-dependent behavior of these CDZs provided a
platform for DA as well as CA detection to a satisfactory level. The
fluorometric DA sensor was free of UA and AA interference, suggesting
that it will be useful in biomedical applications. The overall process
is depicted in Scheme 1.

and characterizations have been
documented in the Supporting Information.

Synthesis of ZnO-Associated CDs
The hydrothermal treatment
was employed for the synthesis of CDZs. The mixture of 500 μL,
0.01 M Zn(OAc)·6H2O and 500 μL, 0.01 g/10 mL
CD was taken in a Teflon-lined autoclave reactor and kept at 180 °C
for 6 h. The CDs were synthesized using microwave treatment of the
solution containing 1 M 200 μL TEPA and 0.1 M 300 μL CA
for 5 min at the highest power of a domestic microwave oven. A brown
solid precipitate was found after the microwave treatment. This solid
was readily soluble in water. This solution was taken for the hydrothermal
treatment which produced a pale-yellow colored solution. The solution
was centrifuged and dialyzed before storing at room temperature. This
solution exhibited blue emission under UV irradiation.

The quantum
yield of this blue emitting solution was calculated using the following
equation,29 2  where, Y, I, A, and η denote the quantum yield, fluorescence,
absorbance, and refractive index, respectively. The subscripts “sl”
and “ref” refer to the sample (CDZ) and reference, quinine
sulfate (prepared in 0.1 M H2SO4 solution),
respectively.

Preparation of the Sensing Platform
The sensing studies
were performed in an aqueous medium at room temperature. The biomolecules
were added individually to the as-prepared CDZ solution for fluorescence
measurements at an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. The time-dependent
study showed that an incubation time of 6 h provided best results.
The DA concentration-dependent emissive behavior of CDZs was also
studied under the same experimental conditions. The interference study
was performed by mixing other biomolecules and cations at a 1:1 ratio.
For the general study, PBS (pH = 7.4) was used. CA sensing was performed
in an acidic solution (pH = 2.0) following the abovementioned process.

Real Sample Analysis
The blood sample was collected
from a healthy volunteer. The blood was centrifuged to remove the
heavy particles and the centrifugate was collected for analysis. The
centrifugate was diluted at various ratios. DA was spiked over the
samples using a standard addition method. The PBS medium was used
throughout the experiment.

Cell Culture and Fluorescence Imaging
The cell-imaging
studies were performed on HeLa cells. ∼8 × 104 cells per well, seeded in 6-well plates were taken for the experiment.
Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium at
37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For complete adherence of cells to the surface a time period of
24 h was needed.51 After that, the culture
medium was replaced with 0.5 mL freshly synthesized CDZ solution (1
mg/mL) and was kept under incubation for 6 h. The cells were washed
three times with PBS buffer (pH = 7.2) before recording the cell images
to remove the excess CDZ, followed by fixation of cells with a 4%
paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min. Then the system was washed twice
using the PBS solution. The fixed cells were then observed using a
405 nm laser excitation through a confocal fluorescence instrument.
