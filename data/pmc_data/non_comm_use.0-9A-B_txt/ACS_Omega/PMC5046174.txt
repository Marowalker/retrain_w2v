The
search for efficient plasmonic photothermal therapies using
nonharmful pulse laser irradiation at the near-infrared (NIR) is fundamental
for biomedical cancer research. Therefore, the development of novel
assembled plasmonic gold nanostructures with the aim of reducing the
applied laser power density to a minimum through hot-spot-mediated
cell photothermolysis is an ongoing challenge. We demonstrate that
gold nanorods (Au NRs) functionalized at their tips with a pH-sensitive
ligand assemble into oligomers within cell lysosomes through hydrogen-bonding
attractive interactions. The unique intracellular features of the
plasmonic oligomers allow us to significantly reduce the femtosecond
laser power density and Au NR dose while still achieving excellent
cell killing rates. The formation of gold tip-to-tip oligomers with
longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance bands at the NIR,
obtained from low-aspect-ratio Au NRs close in resonance with 800
nm Ti:sapphire 90 fs laser pulses, was found to be the key parameter
for realizing the enhanced plasmonic photothermal therapy.

Introduction
The use of plasmonic
gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) for biomedical
purposes has considerably increased in the last few years owing to
their singular optical properties and high biocompatibility.1 In this context, gold nanorods (Au NRs) are attracting
special attention due to the strong light scattering and absorption
at their longitudinal localized surface plasmon resonance (L-LSPR)
wavelength compared to those of spherical Au NPs.2,3 Moreover,
depending on the aspect ratio, the L-LSPR band of Au NRs can be readily
tuned to the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum,4 which corresponds to the optical window of biological
tissues (650–1000 nm).5 These optical
features make Au NRs singularly suitable for in vitro and in vivo
medical applications,6 for instance, as
tools for plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT).1,7

PPTT utilizes Au NPs to convert nonharmful light into thermal energy
through the interaction of laser radiation with the LSPR of plasmonic
nanostructures.8 The intracellular Au NP
heating achieved with PPTT has shown great potential for killing cancer
cells by apoptosis9 or photothermolysis7 processes. With regard to the morphology of the
nanocrystals, the use of anisotropic Au NPs, such as hollow nanocages10 or nanoprisms,9 to
efficiently induce cell death is a notable example of the potential
application of such systems in cancer treatment. Additionally, Au
NRs have been successfully employed in the PPTT-mediated inhibition
of tumor growth through the targeting ability of stem cells.11 With regard to the laser source, under continuous
wave (CW) laser irradiation, the overall effect of mild thermal heating
on Au NPs is intense enough to induce the apoptosis of cancer cells.9,12 Complementary to CW sources,13 pulsed
lasers enable irradiation with low intensity over ultrashort periods
of time, allowing PPTT through highly localized heating of intracellular
Au NPs.10 As a remarkable example, irradiation
of plasmonic Au nanostars with a near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond (fs)
laser at a power density of 0.2 W/cm2, below the maximum
permissible exposure (MPE) threshold of skin (0.4 W/cm2 at 850 nm),14 has been used for the effective
photothermolysis of breast cancer cells.15

Controlled Au NP ensembles are able to confine light in their
interparticle
gaps,16 giving rise to electromagnetic
field enhancements that are several orders of magnitude higher than
those of the incident field, known as hot spots.17 Because of the associated photothermal enhancement at such
subwavelength dimensions,18 the design
of Au NPs with the ability to self-assemble inside the cell to obtain
plasmonic assemblies is essential for PPTT. Interestingly, the characteristic
acidic pH value within cell lysosomes (pH ≤ 5),19 where the Au NPs are mainly accumulated during
the cell uptake process,20 has been used
for PPTT purposes as an internal stimulus for the directed assembly
of small Au nanospheres (10 nm in diameter).21 Although such assemblies allow irradiation with low CW laser power
densities (5 W/cm2) to produce the optimal thermal cancer
cell destruction, this value is still above the MPE threshold of skin;
therefore, the development of pH-controlled Au NP assemblies with
higher plasmonic efficiencies is still a challenge.

Self-assembly
studies have shown the ability of Au NRs functionalized
with pH-sensitive linking molecules to form tip-to-tip ensembles at
pH values that correspond with the pKa values of the linkers.22 Such assemblies
are driven by the strong hydrogen bonding among the protonated states
of the linking molecules at the tips of the Au NRs. Further, we have
recently demonstrated that under fs laser irradiation the formation
of tip-to-tip Au NR oligomers produces longitudinal field enhancements
up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of monomers, which are
related to large temperature increases.23,24

Inspired
by these precedents, we have investigated the specific
pH-driven tip-to-tip assembly of Au NRs (L-LSPR band at ∼800
nm) within cancer cell lysosomes and the PPTT applicability of such
ensembles for the in vitro photothermolysis of breast cancer cells
(MDA-MB 231 cell line). The formation of intracellular plasmonic oligomers,
combined with pulse laser irradiation at the NIR (800 nm Ti:sapphire
90 fs laser pulses, 80 MHz), has led to the optimization of the PPTT
operating conditions, with minimum power density irradiations (0.28
W/cm2, below the MPE threshold of skin), quantitative irradiation
areas (20 mm2), and low incubation Au NR concentrations
(10 pM). Moreover, we have realized a further enhancement of the applied
PPTT using low-aspect-ratio Au NRs (L-LSPR band at ∼600 nm)
by maximizing the coupling between the L-LSPR band of the plasmonic
oligomers and the wavelength of the fs pulses, allowing the reduction
of the power density (0.21 W/cm2) and Au NR dose (1 pM).

Results
and Discussion
One of the main challenges in generating an
intracellular tip-to-tip
assembly of plasmonic Au NR oligomers and forming controlled hot spots
as a tool for PPTT is the development of a successful Au NP functionalization
strategy. This functionalization might be able to drive the tip-to-tip
linkage of Au NRs in the very controlled environment of cells, while
maintaining an acceptable cell uptake and good viability. After the
optimized seed-mediated growth synthesis,25 the Au NRs were stabilized by a bilayer of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide (CTAB), which, however, does not prevent particle aggregation
at physiological ionic strength.26 This
limitation has commonly been solved by CTAB ligand exchange with thiol-modified
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-SH), which offers high Au NP biological
stability27 and biocompatibility28 but reduces the Au NP cell uptake levels.29 For instance, charged functional groups have
been introduced in the chemical structure of PEG-SH to significantly
increase the cell internalization of Au NPs.30

Following these functionalization considerations, we developed
a two-step strategy based on (i) the initial PEGylation of Au NRs
with PEG-SH (6 kDa), which confers the desired colloidal stability
in cell culture media, and (ii) the subsequent specific Au NR tip
functionalization with lipoic acid as a pH-sensitive molecular linker.
The choice of lipoic acid is based on its high biocompatibility as
a cellular micronutrient (synthesized de novo in the mitochondria
and/or by uptake), its antioxidant function (acting as scavenger of
reactive oxygen species),31 and its bifunctional
chemical structure (Figure S1), in which
the presence of opposite disulfide and carboxyl groups (pKa ∼ 5.0) may guarantee strong binding to the Au
NP surface and protonation within the acidic cell lysosomes, respectively.
This approach allows anisotropic functionalization, in which the Au
NRs are specifically coated by PEG-SH and lipoic acid at their sides
and tips, respectively.

So as to optimize the plasmonic system
for PPTT, our strategy included
the study of the influence of the Au NR aspect ratio (3.5 and 1.7,
with L-LSPR bands at 803 and 604 nm, respectively; Figures S2 and S3), the effect of functionalization (PEG-SH
and its combination with lipoic acid), and the Au NR dose of incubation
(decreasing from 0.1 nM to 0.01 pM). With regard to the pulse laser
parameters (800 nm Ti:sapphire 90 fs, 80 MHz), we investigated the
cell viability through the combination of previous experimental conditions
at different laser power densities of irradiation (from 0 to 1.41
W/cm2), maintaining a relatively high exposure surface
(20 mm2) and low irradiation time (1 min).

To validate
the proposed functionalization strategy, we evaluated
the influence of pH on the tip-to-tip assembly of Au NRs by mimicking
the conditions of the intracellular medium. For this purpose, we prepared
sets of functionalized Au NRs (1 nM) with both aspect ratios (3.5
and 1.7) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution at different
pH values (decreasing from 8 to 4). Additionally, PEG (1.5 kDa) was
added as a particle crowding agent, where nonsignificant differences
in the L-LSPR bands of Au NRs were observed, pointing to the suitability
of the Au NR macromolecular crowder (Figure S3). Under analogous pH titration as a control, no changes in the extinction
bands of the Au NRs functionalized with PEG-SH in the absence of particle
lipoic acid were detected (Figure S4),
which confirms the high colloidal stability of the particles. However,
the presence of lipoic acid at their tips dramatically changes the
plasmonic features of the Au NRs below pH 6 (Figure 1a,b), showing a decrease in the L-LSPR band
intensity along with the formation of new bands at the NIR (∼900
and >1100 for Au NRs, with L-LSPR bands at 604 and 803 nm, respectively),
likely due to the formation of short tip-to-tip oligomers.23 We investigated the resulting assembled products
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), where a significant
amount of tip-to-tip dimers, trimers, and tetramers was observed at
pH 5 (pKa of lipoic acid) (Figures 1c,d and S5). Therefore, under acidic conditions mimicking the typical
pH of lysosomes,19 most of the carboxylic
groups of lipoic acid are protonated and therefore directional intermolecular
hydrogen bonding among the neutral linkers at the Au NR tips occurs.22

bands at
(a) 803 nm and (b) 604 nm, functionalized with lipoic acid in the
presence of PEG as a crowding agent in PBS solution at different pH
values (from 8 to 4). Corresponding TEM micrographs of Au NRs with
L-LSPR bands at (c) 803 nm and (d) 604 nm at pH 5, where tip-to-tip
assembled Au NRs are observed. The observed dark background corresponds
to the PEG used as the Au NR crowding agent.

After the successful pH-sensitive functionalization, the
Au NRs
were transferred to cell culture media supplemented with fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and antibiotics. To determine the cell viability, we incubated
breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with 0.1 nM Au NRs. Regardless of
the aspect ratio, the cell viability values (∼90–100%)
remained close to those of the control experiments in the absence
of irradiation for all different functionalizations and incubation
times (1–5 days) (Figures 2a,b and S6). Initially,
photothermolysis of the cancer cells was tested by fs laser irradiation
at different power densities of the samples incubated with Au NRs
(λL-LSPR at 803 nm) for 24 h (Figures 2c and 3). The use of PEG-SH as a capping agent of Au NRs guarantees the
absence of singlet oxygen generation upon pulse laser irradiation
with low power densities (below the MPE threshold of skin), which
excludes photodynamic processes from PPTT.32 At a power density of 0.28 W/cm2, a large killing rate
(up to 85%) was observed for cells incubated with Au NRs functionalized
with lipoic acid. Under the same conditions, the killing rate was
enhanced up to 95% on using the Au NRs with λL-LSPR at 604 nm (Figure 2d). Interestingly, the short-aspect-ratio Au NRs showed an excellent
killing efficiency (∼85%) at an even lower power density of
0.21 W/cm2, which indicates that the L-LSPR band of the
Au NRs may be placed at lower wavelengths with respect to the fs pulses
to achieve optimal PPTT. In the absence of lipoic acid functionalization,
the laser power density had to be increased up to 1.41 W/cm2 (above the MPE threshold of skin) to obtain similar killing rates
(70–90%) with Au NRs of both aspect ratios (Figure 4a,c). At this point, it is
important to note that the use of lipoic acid as a Au NP ligand leads
to high killing rates using very low laser power densities, which
are indeed ∼6 times lower than those needed with Au nanocages10 and of the same order as those required with
Au nanostars,15 which are known to be more
efficient plasmonic systems than isolated Au NRs.33,34 Irradiation at such low fluences, in the range of 2–20 nJ/cm2 per pulse, would be translated into local temperature increments
of a few degrees for single Au NRs in water.35 Therefore, we suspected the formation
of intracellular hot spots with likely larger temperatures, but below
the thermal decomposition temperature of molecular linkers (typically
around 450 K),23 by Au NR tip-to-tip assembly,
as seen in the pH titration experiments.

NRs per cell.

TEM microscopy was used
to gain insight into the Au NR cell uptake
and morphology of the intracellular Au nanostructures (Figures 5a,b, S7, and S8). After 24 h of cell incubation with Au NRs, a large
amount of large tip-to-tip oligomers was observed within the cell
lysosomes, as proof of the proposed Au NR functionalization strategy
for enhanced PPTT. The formation of oligomers can be rationalized
by the acidic microenvironment inside the lysosomes (pH ≤ 5).19 The noticeable improvement in the yield of the
assembled species with respect to that in the pH titration experiments
(Figure 1c,d) can be
explained considering the Au NP confinement in the lysosomes and the
observed templating effect at the organelle membrane (Figures 5c,d, S7, and S8). Lower uptake levels and nonspecific assembly were
observed by TEM in the case of Au NRs without lipoic acid functionalization
(Figure 4b,d).

24 h of incubation with 0.1 nM Au NRs with LSPR bands at (a) 803 nm
and (b) 604 nm, functionalized with lipoic acid. (c) and (d) correspond
to magnifications of the lysosome areas in (a) and (b), respectively.
The estimated uptake values are 21400 ± 6500 (a) and 19300 ± 5200 (b) Au NRs per cell.

At this point, we wondered about
the dependence of the killing
rate levels on the uptake degree and/or hot-spot formation. To determine
the driving factor, we prepared sets of experiments by incubating
the cells with Au NRs at both aspect ratios, functionalized with lipoic
acid at different Au NR doses (from 0.1 nM to 0.01 pM). Figure 6a shows that Au NRs (λL-LSPR at 803 nm) lead to efficient photothermolysis
(∼90%) at concentrations of 10 pM and laser power densities
of 0.28 W/cm2, whereas analogous cell killing rates were
obtained with Au NRs with the L-LSPR band at 604 nm at the same laser
power densities but concentrations of 1 pM (Figure 6b). Therefore, and considering that Au NRs
without lipoic acid provide comparable killing rates at concentrations
of 0.1 nM and laser power densities of 1.41 W/cm2 (Figure 4), the uptake effect
on PPTT can be considered less significant than the plasmonic efficiency
by hot-spot formation. This conclusion is in good agreement with the
uptake levels estimated for the different Au NRs and functionalizations
through TEM analysis (Figures S7 and S8).30 Limited by the wavelength of the
available fs lasers, these results highlight the importance of using
Au NRs with low aspect ratios for the preparation of intracellular
pH-induced tip-to-tip assembled oligomers for PPTT purposes.

(b) 604 nm, functionalized with lipoic acid (800 nm Ti:sapphire 90
fs laser pulses, 80 MHz, 20 mm2 exposure surface, 1 min
irradiation time).

Conclusions
Our
investigations have shown that Au NRs, and in particular the
ones stabilized with lipoic acid, form tip-to-tip assemblies within
model cancer cell lysosomes, which considerably reduce the NIR fs
laser power density irradiation required for efficient PPTT (0.28
W/cm2, below the MPE threshold of skin) with respect to
that needed with random Au NR aggregates (1.41 W/cm2).
The pH-induced directional intermolecular hydrogen bonding between
lipoic acid molecules at the tips of the Au NRs and the lysosome membrane
confinement explain the massive formation of intracellular oligomers.
Under low fs laser irradiation conditions, the temperature increase
at the interparticle gaps of the oligomers is large enough to induce
effective cell death. The formation of Au NR oligomers with low aspect
ratios allows an important reduction in the applied laser power density
(down to 0.21 W/cm2). Therefore, the self-assembly of plasmonic
tip-to-tip oligomers with L-LSPR bands close in resonance with the
NIR wavelength of the fs laser was found to be the decisive phenomenon
for the enhanced PPTT. Such low power densities are comparable to
those obtained with highly plasmonically active Au nanostars (0.2
W/cm2);15 however, they were
achieved at Au NP doses of incubation 2 orders of magnitude lower
(1 pM). Moreover, good death rates of 70% were obtained at a Au NR
incubation concentration of 0.1 pM. Thus, the intracellular self-assembly
strategy demonstrated here opens new prospects in Au NP functionalization
to drive the generation of controlled hot spots in cell organelles,
drastically reducing the aggressiveness of both pulse laser irradiation
and Au NP dose in current cancer photothermal therapies.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Reagents, metal-salt precursors, buffers,
culture media, and other analytical grade chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck. Deionized water from a Millipore system
(>18 MΩ; Milli Q) was used in all experiments.

Optical Characterization
UV–vis–NIR absorption
spectra were recorded using a JASCO-V770 spectrophotometer, with a
spectral bandwidth of 1.0 nm and a scan rate of 200 nm/min. All experiments
were carried out using quartz cuvettes with a 1 cm optical path.

Synthesis of Au NRs (λL-LSPR at 803
nm)
The seeds were prepared by the standard CTAB/NaBH4 procedure: 25 μL of a 0.05 M HAuCl4 solution
was added to 4.7 mL of a 0.1 M CTAB solution; 300 μL of a freshly
prepared 0.01 M NaBH4 solution was then injected under
vigorous stirring. Any excess of borohydride was consumed by keeping
the seed solution for 30 min at room temperature before use. Au NRs
were prepared, with some modifications, as previously described.25 For the synthesis of 50 mL of a Au NR solution,
45 mg of 5-bromosalicylic acid was added to 50 mL of 0.05 M CTAB.
The solution was mildly stirred for 15 min until complete dissolution,
and 480 μL of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 500 μL of 0.05
M HAuCl4 were added to the mixture. After 30 min at 25
°C, 130 μL of a 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution was added
under vigorous stirring, followed by 80 μL of the seed solution.
The mixture was left undisturbed at room temperature for at least
4 h. The resulting Au NRs displayed an L-LSPR with an absorption maximum
at 803 nm. The resulting CTAB-stabilized Au NRs presented a length
and diameter of 56 ± 4 and 16 ± 2 nm, respectively, with
an aspect ratio of 3.6, as determined from TEM images.

Synthesis of
Au NRs (λL-LSPR at 604
nm)
In a typical synthesis of 50 mL of a Au NR solution,
45 mg of 5-bromosalicylic acid was added to 50 mL of 0.05 M CTAB.
The solution was stirred for 15 min until complete dissolution, and
480 μL of 0.01 M AgNO3 and 500 μL of 0.05 M
HAuCl4 were added to the mixture. After 2 h at 25 °C,
130 μL of a 0.1 M ascorbic acid solution was added under vigorous
stirring, followed by 80 μL of the seed solution (described
previously for Au NRs with λL-LSPR at 803
nm). The mixture was left undisturbed at room temperature for at least
4 h. The resulting Au NRs presented an L-LSPR band with a maximum
at 660 nm. Typically, 50 mL of the mixture was centrifuged (6000 rpm,
30 min), and the pellet was redispersed in the same volume of a solution
of 0.05 M CTAB, containing 45 mg of 5-bromosalicylic acid, 700 μL
of 0.01 M AgNO3, 500 μL of 0.05 M HAuCl4, and 250 μL of ascorbic acid. The solution was slowly heated
to 90 °C in a water bath, and the temperature was maintained
until the L-LSPR band of the Au NRs blue-shifted to 604 nm. At this
point, the mixture was rapidly cooled, and the Au NRs were washed
by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min). Finally, the Au NRs were redispersed
in 10 mL of a 2 mM CTAB solution. The resulting CTAB-stabilized Au
NRs presented a length and diameter of 58 ± 4 nm and 34 ±
4 nm, respectively, with an aspect ratio of 1.7, as determined from
TEM images.

PEG Stabilization
The CTAB-stabilized
Au NR dispersion
(10 mL) was washed by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min. After
carefully removing the supernatant, the Au NRs were resuspended in
a solution containing 2 mM PEG (6 kDa) in Milli Q water for 2 h, with
gentle stirring. The resulting mixture was incubated overnight at
room temperature.

Lipoic Acid Functionalization
A
solution of lipoic
acid (1 mM as the final concentration) in Hepes buffer (pH 8) was
added to the concentrated solution of PEG-stabilized nanorods. The
mixture was stirred for 1 h and further incubated for 2 h at room
temperature. Then, the Au NRs were washed to remove the unreacted
molecules, with two centrifugation cycles (at 3000 rpm for 60 min).
The functionalized Au NRs were colloidally stable in PBS buffer as
well as in culture media.

pH Titration Experiments
Au NRs
stabilized with lipoic
acid (1 nM) in PBS buffer and supplemented with 50 g/L PEG (1.5 kDa)
were mixed with small volumes of a diluted solution of HCl (0.01 M)
to reach different pH values (from 8 to 4).

Cell Culture and Viability
Human MDA-MB-231 breast
epithelial cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell
Cultures (ECACC, Salisbury, UK). The cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco; Life Technologies Corporation,
Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% FBS, 500 UI/mL penicillin, and
0.1 mg/mL streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator until confluence. The cell viability after
1–3 and 5 days of incubation with 0.1 nM Au NRs was evaluated
with the Alamar Blue assay (Life Technologies). The cells were incubated
in a 96-well plate with 10% Alamar Blue in DMEM without red phenol
for 3 h following the guidelines of the commercial kit. The absorbance
at 570 nm was followed, using 600 nm as the reference wavelength.
The viability was determined by comparison with control cells (100%).
All reported experiments were performed at least in triplicate.

PPTT
Photothermal irradiation was carried out with
a pulsed laser system, Ti:sapphire ultrafast oscillator (Tsunami,
Spectra-Physics), with a pulse duration of 90 fs, a repetition rate
of 80 MHz, and centered at 800 nm. The laser power density was controlled
by a variable neutral density filter. Au NRs were incubated at concentrations
from 0.1 nM to 0.01 pM for 24 h; therafter, the cells were washed
twice with PBS buffer and fresh supplemented DMEM was added. The incubated
cells contained in a 96-well plate (7 × 103 cells/well)
were illuminated for 1 min, with a laser spot diameter of 5 mm. The
laser power was evaluated from 0 to 1.41 W/cm2. After irradiation,
the cells were incubated in a 96-well plate with 10% Alamar Blue in
DMEM without red phenol for 3 h, following the guidelines of the commercial
kit. The absorbance at 570 nm was followed, using 600 nm as the reference
wavelength. The viability was determined by comparison with control
cells (100%). All reported experiments were performed at least in
triplicate.

TEM
TEM images were obtained with
a JEOL JEM-1010 transmission
electron microscope, operating with an acceleration of 80 kV (CNME,
Spain). The cells were incubated with Au NRs, washed, and fixed with
2% glutaraldehyde in PBS buffer; then, they were stained with 1% osmium
tetroxide and 1.5% potassium cyanoferrate and gradually dehydrated
in acetone. The samples were embedded in Epon, sectioned for analysis,
and cut by ultramicrotomy to 60 nm sections for observation. The Au
NR uptake levels were estimated from the TEM images, following the
procedure described in the literature.30
