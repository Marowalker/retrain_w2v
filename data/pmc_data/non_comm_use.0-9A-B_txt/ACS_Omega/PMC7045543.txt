The
protrusion domain (P-domain; MrNVPd) of Macrobrachium
rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) exists in two conformations,
parallel and X-shaped. We have performed a theoretical study to gain
insight into the nature of the dimeric interactions involving the
dimeric interfaces within parallel and X-shaped conformations of MrNVPd
by applying the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) and natural
bond orbital (NBO) analyses in the framework of the density functional
theory (DFT) approach. The results reveal that the dimer–dimer
interfaces of MrNVPd have hydrogen bonds of common types. Leu255–Lys287,
Tyr257–Lys287, Lys287–Ser253, Met294–Cys328,
Asp295–Lys327, Ser298–Ser324, Ile326–Asp295,
and Cys328–Met294 are the key residue pairs of the dimer–dimer
interfaces to maintain the dimer–dimer structures of MrNVPd
through charge–charge, charge–dipole, dipole–dipole,
hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding interactions. The strengths of these
intermolecular dimer–dimer interactions in the parallel conformation
are much greater than those in the X-shaped conformation. The parallel
trimeric interface is held basically by electrostatic and hydrophobic
interactions. The electrostatic interactions accompanying a strong
hydrogen bond of Oγ1–Hγ1···Oγ1
in the Thr276 A–Thr276 D pair maintain the intermolecular interface
of two X-shaped MrNVPd dimers.

1 Introduction
Macrobrachium
rosenbergii nodavirus
(MrNV) belongs to the Nodaviridae family of viruses and is a causative
agent of a type of infectious viruses called white-tail disease (WTD)
or white muscle disease (WMD) with large-scale mortalities in freshwater
shrimps.1−3 The Nodaviridae genome contains two single-stranded
positive-sense short-genomic RNAs that encodes three gene products:
(1) viral capsid protein (CP) for viral capsid assembly, (2) RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase for RNA replication, and (3) B2 protein for host RNA
interference suppression.4−6 The full-length MrNV CP is a polypeptide
of 371 amino acids. Previous studies on the structures of MrNV virus-like
particles (VLPs) at atom resolution showed that T = 3 MrNV capsid comprises four regions: (1) an N-terminal arm (N-arm),
(2) a shell domain, (3) a linker, and (4) a protrusion domain (P-domain)
(residues 246–371). Crystal structures of the MrNV P-domain
(MrNVPd) exist in two distinct dimer–dimer conformations, one
of which is a parallel model and the other is a closed contact as
an X-shaped model.7

Noncovalent intermolecular
interactions play essential roles in
forming the dimeric MrNV P-domain structures and maintaining the P-domain
dimers. These interactions are classically Coulombic in nature8−10 and are grouped into three categories: hydrogen bonding (H-bonding),
electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions.11 The hydrogen bond (H-bond) is the most characterized type
of interaction and has great importance in a biological system. To
gain insight into the dimeric P-domain interfaces of parallel and
X-shaped MrNV conformations, calculations of intermolecular interactions,
with suitable computational methods, involved in their dimer–dimer
interfaces are necessary for an accurate description. Zhao and Truhlar
investigated the utility of the M06 family with density functional
theory (DFT) in studying the H-bonding interactions in hydrogen-bonded
systems.12−14 Bader’s quantum theory of atoms in molecules
(QTAIM)15,16 and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis17,18 are two extremely useful theoretical methods to achieve enhanced
understanding of the physical nature of the H-bonding interactions
in biological systems. Our objective in this study can be summarized
in three main points. First and foremost is an accurate characterization
of the nature of the intermolecular dimer–dimer interactions
within the dimeric interfaces of the parallel and X-shaped MrNV P-domains
using QTAIM and NBO analyses in the framework of the DFT approach.
The second point is a comparison of the stabilities of the interfaces,
and the third is introduction of the more stable conformation.

2 Structural Models of the Dimeric MrNV P-Domain
Interfaces
The X-shaped MrNVPd conformation comprises two
P-domain dimers
in an asymmetric unit; it is hence a tetrameric protein with two dimeric
interfaces (A/B and C/D) and one tetrameric interface (A/D) (Figure 1). The parallel conformation
contains three identical subunits in a symmetric unit to which we
refer as subunits A1, A2, and A3 (Figure 2). This trimeric protein has hence a dimeric
interface (A1/A2) and a trimeric interface (A1/A3). The interacting
residues in the X-shaped dimeric interface are similar to those in
the parallel dimeric interface consisting of residues Ser253, Leu255,
Tyr257, Lys287, Tyr293, Met294, Asp295, Arg296, Val297, Ser298, Ser324,
Ile326, Lys327, Cys328, Asp329, and Ala366. These residues are arranged
in disparate spatial orientations within each dimeric interface. Residues
Val266, Pro267, Thr276, Gln277, and Asp278 of subunits A and D constitute
the X-shaped tetrameric interface; residues Thr269, Thr280, Ile339,
and Glu341 of subunits A1 and A3 generate the parallel trimeric interface.
These residues are located 5 Å apart from each other in each
interface and participate in noncovalent intermolecular interactions
of various types to keep these interfaces stabilized. To characterize
the physical nature of the intermolecular interactions, the specified
residues of each interface were separated from the other parts of
the X-shaped and parallel MrNV P-domains so as to construct a structural
model from each interface. Figure 3 represents a dimeric interface; Figures 4 and 5 show the X-shaped
tetrameric interface and parallel trimeric interface, respectively.

3 Theoretical Basis
The crystal structures of X-shaped and parallel MrNV P-domains
were previously determined at National Synchrotron Radiation Research
Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan and are available in Protein Data Bank (PDB)
with accession codes 5YKV and 5YKU,7 respectively. Since X-ray diffraction cannot
resolve hydrogen atoms and their positions are not determined in the
corresponding structures, the hydrogen atoms of each structural model
were optimized using hybrid meta-GGA density functional (M06-2X)12,13 in conjunction with the standard 6-31G** basis set to ensure that
their positions were reasonable. During the geometry optimization,
the positions of all other atoms were fixed. Also, the vibrational
frequency calculations were done in each optimized structural model
at the respective level. All optimized structures were at the ground
state because no imaginary frequencies were found.

QTAIM analysis
is a theoretical method that is widely applied to
understand the physical nature of the intra- and intermolecular interactions
by analyzing the electron density distribution function ρ(r).
In the case of minimum-energy structures, there is a line of maximum
electron density linking two bonded nuclei called bond path (BP) as
well as a bond critical point (BCP), which is a saddle point on the
bond path at which the electron density is the minimum.15,16 The electron density at a BCP, ρBCP (rcp), its Laplacian at this point, ∇2ρBCP (rcp), and the electronic
energy density, HBCP, provide valuable
information about the nature and strength of shared (covalent bonds)
or closed-shell (such as van der Waals, ionic, H-bonding, H–H
bonding, etc.) interactions.19,20

NBO analysis
is another useful theoretical method to describe the
nature of the H-bonding interactions in terms of the charge transfer
(CT) from the lone electron pair orbital of an electron donor (proton
acceptor), nB, to the valence antibonding
orbital of an electron acceptor (proton donor), σ*A–H. The energy of the CT interaction is called second-order stabilization
energy, E(2), that it is estimated by
the second-order perturbation theory according to the equation below17,18,21 1  ⟨nB | F | σ*A – H⟩ is
the Fock matrix element, while ε(σ*A – H) – ε(nB) is the energy
difference between the donor and acceptor orbitals. QTAIM and NBO
analyses were performed on each optimized structural model at the
respective level.

To determine the intermolecular interaction
strength, the interaction
energy of each residue pair was calculated and corrected for the basis
set superposition error (BSSE) by the counterpoise (CP) correction
method22,23 at the M06-2X/6-31G** level. Intermolecular
BSSE (IBSSE) of the interaction energy is defined by the equation
below23 2  where EAB represents the single-point energy (SPE)
of each residue
pair, and EA and EB are SPEs of the isolated residues.

All DFT calculations
were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program
package,24 and QTAIM calculations were
done by means of AIM 2000 software.25

4 Results and Discussion
In this study, we combined the
results of QTAIM method with an
NBO analysis to explore precisely the intermolecular interactions
of the interacting residues within the dimeric P-domain interfaces
of parallel and X-shaped MrNV conformations. We classified the interfaces
as dimeric and tetrameric interfaces in the X-shaped model and as
dimeric and trimeric interfaces in the parallel model. The purposes
of identifying these interactions are to compare the stabilities of
the interfaces within the X-shaped model with the parallel model and
to introduce the more stable conformation.

4.1 QTAIM
Analysis on the X-Shaped Dimeric Interfaces
of MrNVPd
As mentioned above (Section 2), X-shaped MrNVPd has two dimeric interfaces,
one of which is between subunits A and B, named model I, and the other
is between subunits C and D, named model II. According to the topological
criteria of Koch–Popelier,26 if
ρBCP on the bond path between the hydrogen atom and
the proton acceptor (H···B BP) locates between 0.002
and 0.040 a.u. and its ∇2ρBCP lies
within 0.020–0.150 a.u., then a H-bonding interaction appears
at the BCP between two atoms. Espinosa and co-workers performed a
topological and related energetic analysis on a range of hydrogen-bonded
complexes and found a correlation between the H-bonding interaction
energy (EHB) with the electronic potential
energy density at the BCP, VBCP, by the
expression27,28 3  The interaction energy of
each H-bond was calculated by the above expression to evaluate its
strength.

Conventionally, if the magnitude of a H-bond energy
exceeds 15 kcal/mol (62.76 kJ/mol), then this bond is considered a
strong H-bonding interaction, whereas the strength of a moderate (normal)
H-bonds varies between 4 and 15 kcal/mol (16.74 and 62.76 kJ/mol).
The H-bonds of energy less than 4 kcal/mol (16.74 kJ/mol) are classified
as weak bonds.11,20 In addition to the BCP properties,
the strength of a H-bond depends on its length and angle.20 The calculated geometrical and topological parameters
and the modulus of H-bond energies, |EHB|, of the H-bonds formed in dimeric A/B and C/D interfaces are collected
in Table 1. Our results
affirm that the calculated values of ρ and ∇2ρ at the various hydrogen-bond critical points (HBCPs) are
in the range proposed by Koch and Popelier.26

a The H-bond
distance (d) is in Angstrom (Å), and the H-bond
angle (∠) is in
degrees (°). All ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and HBCP parameters are in
atomic units (a.u.). |EHB| is in kJ/mol.

Our QTAIM analysis reveals
that the Oη nucleus of Tyr257
A is a proton donor in the formation of a Oη–Hη···O
H-bond with Lys287 B and is a proton acceptor in the interaction of
N–H···Oη with Ala366 B (Figure 6a). As |EHB| (51.84 kJ/mol) of the former H-bond is greater than that
of the latter H-bond (27.89 kJ/mol), Tyr257 A has a stronger H-bonding
interaction with Lys287 B than with Ala366 B. Similarly, a N–H···Oη
H-bond is formed between Ala366 A and Tyr257 B but of a smaller length
(1.84 Å) and larger |EHB| (33.09
kJ/mol). Analogous to model I, two H-bonds of N–H···Oη
and Oη–Hη···O are identified in
Tyr257 D–Ala366 C and Lys287 C–Tyr257 D pairs, respectively
(Figure 6b). Based
on the topological parameters, the strength of N–H···Oη
enhances from model I to model II, whereas the strength of Oη–Hη···O
in model I is greater than in model II (Table 1).

Figure 6 H-bonds formed in residue pairs Leu255–Lys287,
Tyr257–Ala366,
and Lys287–Tyr257 within (a) the dimeric A/B interface and
(b) dimeric C/D interface of the X-shaped MrNVPd. The oxygen, carbon,
nitrogen, and hydrogen atoms are shown in red, gray, blue, and white
colors, respectively.

QTAIM analysis recognizes
the Oη–Hη···N
H-bond in the Tyr257 C–Ala366 D pair (Figure 6b). Although the type of H-bond in this pair
differs from that in the Tyr257 A–Ala366 B pair because of
conformational changes, the strength of the Oη–Hη···N
and N–H···Oη H-bonds is nearly identical
because their |EHB| values are approximately
equal (Table 1). Besides,
the Nζ–Hζ1···O H-bond is observed
between Lys287 and Leu255 in both models (Figure 6a,b). As shown in Table 1, Hζ1···O BCPs in both
pairs of Leu255 A–Lys287 B and Leu255 C–Lys287 D have
almost the same values of ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and |EHB|. The
strength of this interaction hence does not alter substantially during
the conformational changes. Figure 6a,b displays a H-bond of a common type in Ser253 B–Lys287
A and Ser253 D–Lys287 C pairs. The length of the Nζ–Hζ3···O
H-bond in model I is 2.62 Å, and its angle is 109.59°, whereas
its length and angle in model II are 2.01 Å and 171.23°,
respectively. Additionally, values of ρBCP (0.0212
a.u.) and ∇2ρBCP (0.0570 a.u.)
at Hζ3···O BCP increase from model I to model
II; its |EHB| (20.91 kJ/mol) in Ser253
D–Lys287 C is three times that in Ser253 B–Lys287 A
(6.96 kJ/mol). The conformational changes thus convert this H-bond
from a weak interaction in model I to a moderate interaction in model
II.

Figure 3 displays
the location of residues Tyr293, Met294, Asp295, Arg296, Val297, and
Ser298 around residues Ser324, Ile326, Lys327, Cys328, and Asp329.
Our results show that Met294 of each subunit plays simultaneously
both donor and acceptor roles in the formation of two N–H···O
H-bonds with Cys328 from its opposite subunit (Figure 7). As can be seen in Table 1, the largest values of ρBCP (0.0522 a.u.) and ∇2ρBCP (0.1801
a.u.) are observed in H···O BCP in the Met294 B–Cys328
A pair in the case where Met294 B acts as a H-bond acceptor. In contrast,
this N–H···O H-bond has the largest |EHB| (60.61 kJ/mol) and the smallest length (1.61
Å) compared with the other interaction: this H-bond is the strongest
H-bonding interaction in the dimeric interfaces of the X-shaped MrNVPd.

Figure 7 There
are four H-bonds of N–H···O type in
Met294 A–Cys328 B and Met294 B–Cys328 A pairs. These
H-bonds are also repeated in Met294 C–Cys328 D and Met294 C–Cys328
D pairs.

Met294 of each subunit also forms
a weak H-bond Cα–Hα···O
with Lys327 from its contrary subunit. Moreover, Lys327 in both subunits
B and C interacts with Asp295 of subunits A and D, respectively, through
a Nζ–Hζ3···Oδ1 H-bond. As
there is only a slight difference between its |EHB| (17.69 kJ/mol) in the Asp295 A–Lys327 B pair and
that in the Asp295 D–Lys327 C pair (16.98 kJ/mol), this H-bond
in model I is slightly stronger than that in model II. Except for
Cys328 C–Tyr293 D, QTAIM analysis identifies the presence of
a Hβ2···O BCP in each Cys328–Tyr293 pair.
Small values of ρBCP and ∇2ρBCP of these BCPs confirm that Cβ–Hβ2···O
H-bonds in these residue pairs are weak interactions (Table 1).

Figure 8a,b depicts
that Ile326 of each subunit forms H-bonds of type N–H···O
with Arg296 of its opposite subunit. The values of ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and |EHB| in H···O BCP in the Arg296 C–Ile326
D pair signify that both N–H···O H-bonds have
the same strength (Table 1). In the Arg296 D–Ile326 C pair, when Arg296 D acts
as a H-bond acceptor, this H-bond with |EHB| of 12.92 kJ/mol and a length of 2.28 Å is a weak interaction,
whereas it is a moderate interaction when Arg296 D behaves as a H-bond
donor. In H···O BCP in the Arg296 A–Ile326 B
pair, the values are ρBCP = 0.0222 a.u., ∇2ρBCP = 0.0736 a.u., and |EHB| = 24.32 kJ/mol, wherein Arg296 A is a H-bond acceptor;
these values are the greatest among the eight H-bonds. Except for
the Arg296 A–Ile326 B pair, a very weak H-bond of type Cβ–Hβ···O
is also formed in each Arg296–Ile326 pair. Furthermore, there
is one weak H-bond of type Cα–Hα···O
in each Ile326–Asp295 pair (Table 1).

Figure 8 Two H-bonds of N–H···O
exist in (a) the Arg296
A–Ile326 B pair as well as (b) the Arg296 B–Ile326 A
pair. These four H-bonds emerges in Arg296 C–Ile326 D and Arg296
D–Ile326 C pairs.

QTAIM analysis detects
two HBCPs of Hα···O
and H···O in all Ser324–Val297 and Ser324–Ser298
pairs, respectively, with the exception of Ser324 D–Val297
C and Ser324 D–Ser298 C pairs (Figure 9). Of these, N–H···O
in the Ser324 B–Ser298 A pair is the strongest H-bond because
it has the largest |EHB| (38.55 kJ/mol)
and the least length (1.75 Å), relative to the other interactions
of Ser324. Among unconventional H-bonds of various kinds in both models,
the Cα–Hα···O H-bond in the Ser324
C–Val297 D pair has the largest values of ρBCP (0.0174 a.u.), ∇2ρBCP (0.0538
a.u.), and |EHB| (18.09 kJ/mol) (Table 1). It is thus the
strongest H-bonding interaction of type C–H···O
in the dimeric interfaces of the X-shaped MrNVPd.

Figure 9 Residues Val297, Ser298,
and Ser324 assist in the stability of
the dimeric A/B interface through N–H···O and
Cα–Hα···O H-bonds. These H-bonds
appears in Ser324 C–Val297 D and Ser324 C–Ser298 D pairs
also.

As mentioned above (Section 3), the total electronic energy
density, HBCP, is another topological
parameter describing the nature
of a H-bond, which is defined as a sum of the local kinetic energy
density, GBCP, and the electronic potential
energy density, VBCP.19,20 According to Rozas et al.’s point of view,29 positive ∇2ρBCP and
negative HBCP values in H···B
BCP are characteristic of a partially covalent nature in a pertinent
H-bonding interaction. As shown in Table 1, all H···B BCPs are recognized
by the positive values of ∇2ρBCP and by the negative values of HBCP.
We hence conclude that moderate H-bonds in both models must be considered
as an intermediate between covalent and electrostatic characters,
whereas their weak H-bonds have a basically electrostatic character.
It is worth mentioning that the covalent nature of a moderate H-bond
is decreased by decreasing its strength.

4.2 QTAIM
Analysis on the Parallel Dimeric Interface
of MrNVPd
QTAIM analysis on the parallel dimeric A1/A2 interface
(model III) indicates that the types of H-bonds formed within this
interface are totally common to those within the X-shaped dimeric
interfaces, except four uncommon H-bonds.

It can be noted from Table 2 that the amounts
of ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and |EHB| on Hζ1···O
BCP of Leu255 A1–Lys287 A2 and Leu255 A2–Lys287 A1 pairs
are increased significantly relative to those of Leu255 A–Lys287
B and Leu255 C–Lys287 D pairs. The parallel dimeric interface
has thus more stable Nζ–Hζ1···O
H-bonds than the X-shaped dimeric interfaces. Moreover, the Cδ−Hδ3···O
H-bond with |EHB| of 9.56 kJ/mol and a
length of 2.46 Å is identified in the Leu255 A2–Lys287
A1 pair; this H-bond is not found in the X-shaped dimeric interfaces.
The Oη–Hη···O H-bond between Lys287
A1 and Tyr257 A2 has |EHB| of 45.68 kJ/mol
and a length of 1.68 Å; its strength in this pair is hence less
than that of the Lys287 B–Tyr257 A pair but more than that
of the Lys287 C–Tyr257 D pair. The conformational changes cause
two strengthened H-bonds Oη–Hη···N
and Nζ–Hζ3···O in Ala366 A2–Tyr257
A1 and Ser253 A2–Lys287 A1 pairs, respectively, but a weakened
N–H···Oη H-bond of the Tyr257 A2–Ala366
A1 pair (Tables 1 and 2).

a The H-bond distance (d) is in Angstrom (Å),
and the H-bond angle (∠) is in
degrees (°). All ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and HBCP parameters are in
atomic units (a.u.). |EHB| is in kJ/mol.

In the parallel dimeric interface,
N–H···O
H-bonds in Met294–Cys328 pairs are converted to stronger interactions
with shorter H···O distances than those obtained from
the X-shaped dimeric interfaces (Tables 1 and 2). The N–H···O
H-bond between Cys328 A1 and Met294 A2 with |EHB| of 62.27 kJ/mol and a length of 1.62 Å is the strongest
interaction of this interface. Three H-bonds Cα–Hα···O
in pairs Met294 A2–Lys327 A1, Met294 A1–Lys327 A2, and
Met294 D–Lys327 C are almost equivalent topologically and geometrically.
The Cβ–Hβ2···O H-bond in the Met294
A1–Asp329 A2 pair with |EHB| of
7.74 kJ/mol and a length of 2.49 Å becomes weaker than that in
the Met294 A–Asp329 B pair. In contrast, the H-bond strength
of Lys327A2 with Asp295 A1 is enhanced remarkably by converting from
the X-shaped model to the parallel model as |EHB| and the length of Nζ–Hζ3···Oδ1
between them attain 55.57 kJ/mol and 1.66 Å, respectively. Furthermore,
these two residues interact with each other through a weak H-bond
Cδ−Hδ2···Oδ1, whereas this
H-bond does not form between the corresponding residues inside the
X-shaped dimeric interfaces.

In the Arg296 A1–Ile326
A2 and Arg296 A2–Ile326 A1
pairs, when Arg296 is a H-bond acceptor, two H-bonds of N–H···O
and both H-bonds of Cβ–Hβ···O are
weakened by conformational changes, but the topology and geometry
of their other two N–H···O H-bonds approach
closely those in the Arg296 C–Ile326 D and Arg296 B–Ile326
A pairs. Both H-bonds Cα–Hα···O
in Ile326 A2–Asp295 A1and Ile326 A1–Asp295 A2 pairs
have topological and geometrical parameters nearly equal to those
of this H-bond in the Ile326 C–Asp295 D pair. The N–H···O
H-bond in the Ser324 A2–Ser298 A1 pair with |EHB| of 33.50 kJ/mol and a length of 1.80 Å is only
slightly stronger than that in the Ser324 A1–Ser298 A2 pair
with |EHB| of 32.75 kJ/mol and a length
of 1.81 Å. This H-bond in the Ser324 A–Ser298 B pair has
|EHB| of 32.57 kJ/mol and a length of
1.82 Å. As a result, these three H-bonds have equal strengths.
Although two H-bonds of Cα–Hα···O
in Ser324 A2–Val297 A1 and Ser324 A1–Val297 A2 pairs
are somewhat stronger than that in the Ser324 B–Val297 A pair,
both are weaker than those in the Ser324 A–Val297 B and Ser324
C–Val297 D pairs (Tables 1 and 2).

In addition to
the cited interactions, two weak H-bonds Cβ–Hβ3···Oδ2
are detected in the Asp329 A1–Asp295 A2 and Asp329 A2–Asp295
A1 pairs, neither of which are formed between the corresponding residues
in the X-shaped dimeric interfaces. QTAIM analysis characterizes all
H-bonds with a negative sign of HBCP in
the parallel dimeric interface (Table 2). The partially covalent nature of each of these H-bonds
is consequently expected. Our results exhibit that the sums of the
hydrogen bond energies derived from H-bonds pertaining to residue
pairs within the dimeric A1/A2, A/B, and C/D interfaces are 681.78,
538.17, and 453.32 kJ/mol, respectively. As a consequence, the total
H-bonding interactions arising from the parallel dimeric interface
are much stronger than those resulting from each of dimeric interfaces
of the X-shaped model.

4.3 NBO Analysis on the X-Shaped
Dimeric Interfaces
of MrNVPd
QTAIM analysis delineated the conventional and
unconventional H-bonds of various types that ensure the stabilities
of the dimer–dimer interfaces of the X-shaped MrNVPd. In this
section, we apply the second-order perturbation energies extracted
from the NBO analysis to evaluate the strengths of the local orbitals
of the partner atoms in each of these H-bonds (Table 3).

NBO analysis shows
that the nOη lone pair of Tyr257
A is an electron donor for the antibonding σ*N–H of Ala366 B, but its σ*Oη–Hη is an electron acceptor for nO of Lys287
B. The E(2) value (56.57 kJ/mol) of the nOη → σ*N–H interaction is somewhat smaller than that (58.16 kJ/mol) of the nO → σ*Oη–Hη interaction. Local orbitals in the Lys287 B–Tyr257 A pair
thus have stronger attractive interactions than those in the Tyr257
A–Ala366 B pair. Similarly, a nOη → σ*N–H charge-transfer interaction
appeared in two pairs, Tyr257 B–Ala366 A and Tyr257 D–Ala366
C; the nO → σ*Oη–Hη interaction is repeated in the Lys287 C–Tyr257 D pair. As
presented in Table 3, the nOη → σ*N–H interaction in the Tyr257 D–Ala366 C pair
has the largest values of qCT (0.0264 e) and E(2) (83.93 kJ/mol) relative
to the other two pairs. The electron-donor orbital is consequently
more strongly attracted to the electron-acceptor orbital in this pair.

Because of conformational changes, the charge-transfer interaction
in the Tyr257 C–Ala366 D pair differs from that in the three
corresponding residue pairs. Charge transfer (0.0245 e) from nN of Ala366 D to σ*Oη–Hη of Tyr257 C makes the nN → σ*Oη–Hη interaction with E(2) of 58.07 kJ/mol
between these residues possible. The nO of Leu255 A overlaps with σ*Nζ–Hζ1 of Lys287 B; this orbital overlap is repeated between equivalent
orbitals in the Leu255 C–Lys287 D pair. The nearly equal stabilization
energies for the nO → σ*Nζ–Hζ1 interactions denote the same strength
of donor–acceptor interactions in these residue pairs. An infinitesimal
charge transfer (0.0004 e) occurs from nO of Ser253 B to σ*Nζ–Hζ3 in Lys287 A with E(2) of 1.51 kJ/mol.
The nO → σ*Nζ–Hζ3 interaction exists also between Ser253 D and Lys287 C with qCT of 0.0084 e and E(2) of 27.20 kJ/mol. As expected, charge-transfer
interaction in the Lys287 C–Ser253 D pair is much stronger
than that in the Lys287 A–Ser253 B pair.

NBO analysis
indicates that Met294 of each subunit participates
in two charge-transfer interactions of nO → σ*N–H with Cys328 from its inverse
subunit. Among these eight interactions, the nO → σ*N–H interactions in Met294–Cys328
pairs in which Met294 acts as an electron donor have greater qCT and E(2) values
than those in pairs in which Met294 behaves as an electron acceptor.
Likewise, the H···O distances in the second case are
larger than those in the first case (Table 1). Our previous studies demonstrated that
an increment in the H-bond length is associated with a decreased strength
of a charge-transfer interaction.30,31 It is hence
expected that the elongation of this H-bond decreases its strength.
As can be seen in Table 3, the greatest values of qCT (0.0367 e) and E(2) (90.29 kJ/mol) are
associated with a charge transfer from nO of Met294 B to σ*N–H of Cys328 A. In agreement
with the |EHB| prediction, it is thus
the strongest charge-transfer interaction in the X-shaped dimeric
interfaces.

A nO → σ*Cβ–Hβ2 charge-transfer interaction exists
in each Cys328–Tyr293
pair, except the Cys328 C–Tyr293 D pair. In all Met294–Lys327
pairs, an orbital overlap exists between nO of Met294 and σ*Cα–Hα in Lys327.
All these interactions have small values of qCT and E(2) (Table 3). According to the |EHB| results, the donor–acceptor interactions in these
residue pairs are hence weak. Electrons of the nO lone pairs in Asp295 of subunits A and D are transferred
to the antibonding σ*Nζ–Hζ3 orbitals
in Lys327 of subunits B and C, respectively. The E(2) value of the nOδ1 → σ*Nζ–Hζ3 interaction
in the Asp295 A–Lys327 B pair is 29.58 kJ/mol, whereas this
interaction in the Asp295 D–Lys327 C pair has a smaller E(2) (24.27 kJ/mol). Accordingly, attractive
interactions between the interacting local orbitals in the former
pair are slightly stronger than those in the latter pair.

NBO
analysis reveals two charge-transfer interactions of nO → σ*N–H in
each Arg296–Ile326 pair. Among these pairs, the largest values
of qCT and E(2) pertain to two interactions of an Arg296 A–Ile326 B pair.
The lowest values of qCT and E(2) are found in pairs Arg296 B–Ile326 A and Arg296
D–Ile326 C in which both residues Arg296 have the electron-donor
role (Table 3). An
infinitesimal charge transfer occurs also from the nO lone pairs of Arg296 of subunits B, D, and C to the
antibonding orbitals σ*Cβ–Hβ in
Ile326 of subunits A, C, and D, respectively. The small E(2) values of all three interactions indicate the presence
of weak donor–acceptor interactions in these residue pairs.
Likewise, Ile326 of each subunit interacts weakly with Asp295 from
its counter subunit through the charge-transfer interaction of nO → σ*Cα–Hα (Table 3).

The oxygen backbone of Ser324 in each subunit donates concurrently
its electrons to the antibonding orbitals σ*Cα–Hα and σ*N–H in Val297 and Ser298 from its
reverse subunit, respectively. According to the |EHB| estimation, the nO →
σ*N–H interaction in the Ser324 B–Ser298
A pair with E(2) of 70.75 kJ/mol and qCT of 0.0192 e has the strongest
charge-transfer interaction of Ser324. In contrast, the nO → σ*Cα–Hα interaction between residues Ser324 C and Val297 D is the strongest
unconventional charge-transfer interaction inside the X-shaped dimeric
interfaces (Table 3).

It is necessary to mention that the percentage s-character
of the
hybrid orbital of the proton-donor atom in an A–H bond is an
effective factor affecting the strength of a H-bond. It is evident
from the results in Table 3 that an increased strength of the H-bond is associated with
an enhanced s-character in an A-hybrid orbital in the A–H bond;
the reason is that hydrogen in an A-H donor bond becomes more electropositive
with an incremented H-bond strength. The highest s-character (32.26%)
in an A–H bond belongs to the strongest H-bonding interaction,
namely, the N–H···O H-bond in the Met294 B–Cys328
A pair.

4.4 NBO Analysis on the Parallel Dimeric Interface
of MrNVPd
As previously mentioned, conformational changes
make stronger Nζ–Hζ1···O H-bonds
of Leu255–Lys287 pairs in model III; the reason is that each nO → σ*Nζ–Hζ1 interaction in this model is a consequence of a great charge transfer
with stabilization energy more than six times those in models I and
II (Table 4). A weak
Cδ−Hδ3···O H-bond in the Leu255
A2–Lys287 A1 pair arises from a weak charge-transfer interaction nOδ2 → σ*Cδ−Hδ3 with E(2) of 3.26 kJ/mol. In the Lys287
A1–Tyr257 A2 pair, the nO →
σ*Oη–Hη interaction with qCT of 0.0172 e and E(2) of 62.17 kJ/mol has a strength almost equal
to that of this interaction in the Lys287 C–Tyr257 D pair possessing qCT of 0.0213 e and E(2) of 62.01 kJ/mol. The nN → σ*Oη–Hη interaction
in the Ala366 A2–Tyr257 A1 pair is stronger than that in the
Tyr257 C–Ala366 D pair because of a larger stabilization energy
in model III. Because of a decreased stabilization energy, the nOη → σ*N–H interaction in the Tyr257 A2–Ala366 A1 pair is weakened relative
to those in the Tyr257–Ala366 pairs of models I and II (Tables 3 and 4).

In model III, the charge-transfer
interactions nO → σ*N–H of Met294–Cys328
pairs have large stabilization energies and a large percentage of
s-character in N-hybrid orbitals in the N–H bond (Table 4). These factors are
responsible for the shortening and strengthening of H···O
bonds in model III relative to those in models I and II. The strongest nO → σ*N–H interaction
with qCT of 0.0209 e and E(2) of 76.23 kJ/mol emerges between Cys328 A1
and Met294 A2. Similar to models I and II, two interactions nO → σ*Cα–Hα in Met294–Lys327 pairs and three interactions nO → σ*Cβ–Hβ2 in Met294 A1–Asp329 A2, Cys328 A2–Tyr293 A1, and Cys328
A1–Tyr293 A2 pairs result from weak charge-transfer interactions
because of small qCT and E(2) values. In the Asp295 A1–Lys327 A2 pair, a
remarkably increased strength of the Nζ–Hζ3···Oδ1
H-bond is the result of strong attractive interactions between nOδ1 of Asp295 A1 and σ*Nζ–Hζ3 of Lys327A2. The nOδ1 →
σ*Nζ–Hζ3 interaction with qCT of 0.0401 e and E(2) of 91.13 kJ/mol is the strongest donor–acceptor
interaction in the parallel dimeric interface. The weak nOδ1 → σ*Cδ−Hδ2 interaction with E(2) of 2.13 kJ/mol
is responsible for the formation of a weak Cδ−Hδ2···Oδ1
H-bond.

In Arg296–Ile326 pairs of model III, when Arg296
is an electron
donor, interactions nO → σ*N–H and nO → σ*Cβ–Hβ are weaker than those in Arg296–Ile326
pairs of models I and II. The other two nO → σ*N–H interactions of these residue
pairs in all three models have approximately equal strengths. Analogous
to models I and II, the interactions nO → σ*Cα–Hα in Ser324–Val297
and Ile326–Asp295 pairs in model III are weak donor–acceptor
interactions because of their small stabilization energies and charge
transfers. In all three models, the nO → σ*N–H interactions of Ser324–Ser298
pairs are strong charge-transfer interactions because they possess
appropriate values of stabilization energies, charge transfers, and
s-character in the N–H bond (Tables 2 and 4). In Asp329–Asp295
pairs, each weak Cβ–Hβ3···Oδ2
H-bond is the result of a weak charge-transfer interaction, nOδ2 → σ*Cβ–Hβ3 (Table 4).

NBO analysis reveals that the total stabilization energies obtained
from the charge-transfer interactions related to residue pairs within
the dimeric A1/A2, A/B, and C/D interfaces are 922.45, 704.59, and
608.60 kJ/mol, respectively. The parallel dimeric interface has hence
much stronger overall charge-transfer interactions than each dimeric
interface of the X-shaped model.

4.5 QTAIM
and NBO Analyses on the X-Shaped Tetrameric
Interference of MrNVPd
As mentioned above (Section 2), some residues of subunits
A and D are located at the tetrameric interface of the X-shaped MrNVPd
(Figure 4). These residues
assist the tetrameric interface in maintaining the formation of H-bonds
with each other (Figure 10 and Table 5). The oxygen lone pair of Pro267 A transfers charges of 0.0016 e and 0.0022 e simultaneously to the antibonding
orbitals of σ*Cγ2–Hγ22 in Val266
D and σ*Cδ−Hδ3 in Pro267 D, respectively.
Additionally, its σ*Cδ−Hδ3 accepts
a charge of 0.0026 e from nO of Pro267 D. The E(2) values
of the nO → σ*Cγ2–Hγ22 and nO → σ*Cδ−Hδ3 interactions are small; the donor–acceptor interactions in
these residue pairs are thus weak. The values of ρBCP, ∇2ρBCP, and |EHB| for the paths Hγ22···O and Hδ3···O
confirm that two H-bonds of Cδ−Hδ3···O
in the Pro267 A–Pro267 D pair, as well as the Cγ2–Hγ22···O
H-bond in the Val266 D–Pro267 A pair, are weak interactions
(Table 5).

NBO analysis demonstrates
that a charge transfer (0.0029 e) from the nO of Thr276 A to
the σ*N–H of Thr276 D forms the N–H···O
H-bond with a length of 2.22 Å and |EHB| of 15.53 kJ/mol between these residues. Correspondingly, the O
lone pair of Thr276 D is transferring the qCT of 0.0025 e to the σ*N–H of Thr276 A by the formation of a N–H···O
H-bond with a length of 2.20 Å and |EHB| of 15.88 kJ/mol between them. Although both H-bonds have the same
strengths, the small E(2) values of the nO → σ*N–H interactions
indicate the presence of weak attractive interactions between the
partner orbitals in each H-bond (Table 5).

Thr276 A forms two BCPs with a hydroxyl group
of Thr276 D. One
of them connects its Oγ1 to Hγ1 of Thr276 D, and the other
is placed in the path connecting its H to Oγ1 of Thr276 D. The
Hγ1···Oγ1 BCP has the largest values of
ρBCP (0.0812 a.u) and ∇2ρBCP (0.2221 a.u.) among the HBCPs that are found in the interfaces
of X-shaped MrNVPd. Oγ1–Hγ1···Oγ1
with a length of 1.45 Å and |EHB|
of 123.69 kJ/mol is a strong H-bond of basically covalent character.
This interaction is the result of a significant charge transfer (0.0738 e) from nOγ1 of Thr276
A to σ*Oγ1–Hγ1 of Thr276 D with
a large E(2) of 245.68 kJ/mol. The nOγ1 → σ*Oγ1–Hγ1 interaction acquires the largest s-character (31.31%) in this interface.
This H-bond is manifested to play a crucial role in stabilizing the
X-shaped tetrameric interference. In contrast, N–H···Oγ1
has little effect on the stability of this interface because the H-bond
is weak (Table 5).

4.6 Comparison of Stabilities of the Interfaces
within X-Shaped and Parallel Models of MrNVPd
QTAIM and NBO
analyses provide insight into the strength of various H-bonding interactions
of the interacting residue pairs within the dimeric interfaces of
the parallel and X-shaped conformations of MrNVPd. The interaction
energy (eq 2) is an appropriate
criterion to determine the strength of an intermolecular interaction
of each residue pair at each dimeric interface. Table 6 contains the modulus of interaction energies,
|Einteraction|, and dipole moments of
various residue pairs of all three models.

A single proton (positive charge) is known to exist
on the Nζ
atom of Lys; the side chain of Arg possesses a guanidine group. Leu255–Lys287,
Tyr257–Lys287, Lys287–Ser253, Met294–Lys327,
and Arg296–Ile326 pairs of all three models are hence positively
charged residue pairs. Positive charges of Lys and Arg are possible
to implement the electrostatic interactions of charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole types in these charged pairs. Among them,
the greatest |Einteraction| values are
observed in Leu255–Lys287 pairs of all three models (Table 6). The QTAIM and NBO
results confirm that Nζ–Hζ1···O
H-bonds in Leu255–Lys287 pairs of models I and II are weak
H-bonding interactions. Large |Einteraction| values in Leu255 A–Lys287 B (106.96 kJ/mol) and Leu255 C–Lys287
D (97.27 kJ/mol) pairs indicates that the electrostatic interactions
are the major contributor to the intermolecular interactions in these
two pairs. In contrast, the Nζ–Hζ1···O
H-bonds in two Leu255–Lys287 pairs of model III are moderate
interactions. For this reason, the interaction energies in Leu255
A1–Lys287 A2 (128.57 kJ/mol) and Leu255 A2–Lys287 A1
(120.38 kJ/mol) pairs are the greatest among the four pairs.

As mentioned above, Nζ–Hζ3···O
H-bonds in Ser253 B–Lys287 A and Ser253 A2–Lys287 A1
pairs are weak interactions, whereas a moderate H-bond occurs in the
Ser253 D–Lys287 C pair. As expected, the latter pair with |Einteraction| of 86.30 kJ/mol has the strongest
intermolecular interactions relative to the other two pairs. Small
|Einteraction| values of Met294–Lys327
and Lys327–Met294 pairs of all three models denote weak intermolecular
interactions in each of these pairs. As |Einteraction| in the Arg296 A–Ile326 B pair (29.57 kJ/mol) is almost the
same with that in the Arg296 C–Ile326 D pair (30.32 kJ/mol),
their intermolecular interaction strengths are equivalent. |Einteraction| of the Arg296 A1–Ile326
A2 pair is 34.70 kJ/mol; this pair has thus intermolecular interactions
stronger than the other two pairs. Nearly identical |Einteraction| values of Ile326–Arg296 pairs of all
three models demonstrate the comparable intermolecular interactions
in these three pairs (Table 6).

In all three models, Met294–Asp329, Asp295–Ile326,
and Ile326–Asp295 pairs are negatively charged residue pairs
because of the presence of a single delocalized electron (negative
charge) between atoms Oδ1 and Oδ2 of each Asp. In addition
to weak unconventional H-bonds, the intermolecular interactions in
each of these charged pairs include charge–dipole and dipole–dipole
interactions. Among them, the Ile326 C–Asp295 D pair with |Einteraction| of 102.59 kJ/mol is the most stable
negatively charged residue pair in the dimeric interfaces of MrNVPd
(Table 6). This pair
plays an important role in stabilizing the dimeric interface between
subunits C and D predominantly through electrostatic interactions.
Tyr257–Ala366, Tyr293–Cys328, Val297–Ser324,
Ser298–Ser324, Ser324–Val297, Ser324–Ser298,
Cys328–Tyr293, and Ala366–Tyr257 pairs of all three
models are polar residue pairs because of the presence of a side-chain
hydroxyl group in Tyr and Ser. In each of these pairs, this hydroxyl
group induces a dipole moment in its nonpolar residue partner. Dipole–dipole
and dipole-induced dipole interactions hence have important contributions
to the electrostatic interactions of each polar residue pair. Of these,
the strongest intramolecular interactions are found in the Tyr257
A1–Ala366 A2 pair because its |Einteraction| (31.47 kJ/mol) and dipole moment (6.63 debye) are the largest among
the polar residue pairs (Table 6). The strength of this pair is comparable to that of the
Tyr257 C–Ala366 D pair with |Einteraction| of 30.76 kJ/mol and a dipole moment of 5.68 debye. Met294–Cys328
and Cys328–Met294 pairs are nonpolar residue pairs in all three
models. In addition to H-bonds, van der Waals interactions of hydrophobic
type become important in these pairs. Among them, the Met294 A–Cys328
B pair with |Einteraction| of 26.15 kJ/mol
is the most stable nonpolar residue pair in the dimeric interfaces
of MrNVPd (Table 6).

In Asp295–Lys327 pairs, the delocalized negative charge
of Asp295 can interact with the localized positive charge of Lys327
through an electrostatic interaction of charge–charge type.
|ΔEele| of the charge–charge
interactions of Asp295 A–Lys327 B, Asp295 D–Lys327 C,
and Asp295 A1–Lys327 A2 pairs are 398.92, 248.54, and 381.68
kJ/mol, respectively. As a result, the charge–charge interactions
are mainly central interactions in these pairs. As shown in Table 6, the largest |Einteraction| value in each model is assigned
to its Asp295–Lys327 pair. It is reasonable to suggest that
these are indispensable residue pairs in all three dimeric interfaces
of MrNVPd, which play fundamental roles in preserving these interfaces
through charge–charge, charge–dipole, dipole–dipole,
and H-bonding interactions. Among them, the Asp295 A1–Lys327
A2 pair with |Einteraction| of 476.21
kJ/mol and a dipole moment of 11.65 debye is the most stable residue
pair in these interfaces.

Based on our results, the total interaction
energies pertaining
to residue pairs involved in dimeric interactions within dimeric A1/A2,
A/B, and C/D interfaces are 1065.71, 790.06, and 915.71 kJ/mol, respectively.
In confirmation of QTAIM and NBO results, the calculations of interaction
energies thus demonstrate that the parallel dimeric interface is the
most stable interface of MrNVPd. Leu255 A1–Lys287 A2, Ser253
A2–Lys287 A1, Leu255 A2–Lys287 A1, Lys287 A1–Tyr257
A2, Met294 A1–Cys328 A2, Ile326 A2–Asp295 A1, Asp295
A1–Lys327 A2, and Cys328 A1–Met294 A2 pairs are crucial
residue pairs of the parallel dimeric interface; they play important
roles in maintaining the interface between subunits A1 and A2 through
conventional and unconventional H-bonds, van der Waals, charge–charge,
charge–dipole, and dipole–dipole interactions. QTAIM
and NBO analyses detected no H-bonds within the parallel trimeric
interface; this interface is accordingly preserved by electrostatic
and van der Waals interactions. The calculated interaction energies
indicate that trimeric interactions are weak intermolecular interactions
(Table 7). The hydrophobic
interactions are dominant trimeric interactions in three residue pairs
of Thr269 A1–Thr269 A3, Ile339 A1–Thr280 A3, and Ile339
A1–Ile339 A3. Because of the presence of a negative charge
between Oε1 and Oε2 atoms of Glu, the Glu341 A1–Thr280
A3 pair is a negatively charged residue pair; charge–dipole
and dipole–dipole interactions have main contributions to trimeric
interactions of this pair. Finally, these dimeric and trimeric interactions
play fundamental roles in the conformational stabilization of the
parallel MrNVPd.

Ile326–Asp295, Cys328–Met294, and Ala366–Tyr257
pairs are key residue pairs of both X-shaped dimeric interfaces. The
Thr276 A–Thr276 D pair is a critical residue pair of the X-shaped
tetrameric interference (Table 7). Although the calculated interaction energies confirm that
the dimeric interface between subunits C and D is more stable than
that between subunits A and B, the dimeric interactions derived from
residue pairs of both dimeric interfaces accompanying tetrameric interactions
provide the conformational stabilization of the X-shaped MrNVPd.

5 Conclusions
In summary, using QTAIM and NBO
analyses at the M06-2X/6-31G**
level, we have investigated computationally the dimeric P-domain interfaces
of parallel and X-shaped MrNV conformations to improve our understanding
of the physical nature of these dimeric interactions that provide
the stabilities of these interfaces. QTAIM and NBO analyses emphasized
that both conformations have H-bonds of common types within their
interfaces. Leu255–Lys287 and Asp295–Lys327 pairs are
two of the most important residue pairs within each dimeric interface
that play significant roles in preserving that interface. Charge–charge
and charge–dipole interactions have contributions mainly to
intermolecular interactions of these pairs. Additionally, Lys287–Ser253,
Tyr257–Lys287, Met294–Cys328, Ser298–Ser324,
Ile326–Asp295, Asp295–Lys327, and Ala366–Tyr257
are the other important residue pairs of these interfaces that assist
in their stabilization, especially through charge–dipole, dipole–dipole,
and H-bonding interactions. The N–H···O H-bonds
in Cys328 A–Met294 B and Met294 A2–Cys328 A1 pairs are
the strongest H-bonding interactions inside the MrNVPd dimer–dimer
interfaces.

The intermolecular interaction strengths of the
various residue
pairs in the parallel dimeric interface were found to be greater than
those in each X-shaped dimeric interface. The parallel dimeric interface
is consequently the most stable interface of MrNVPd. Charge–dipole,
dipole–dipole, and hydrophobic interactions are mainly responsible
for the stability of the parallel trimeric interface. The dimeric
interactions between subunits C and D are much stronger than those
between subunits A and B. The Thr276 A–Thr276 D pair is a critical
residue pair in the tetrameric X-shaped interface, which plays a dominant
role in preserving the intermolecular interface of two MrNVPd dimers
through strong H-bond and electrostatic interactions.
