Porous multicomponent
Mn–Sn–Co
oxide microspheres (MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500) have been fabricated using CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes
as templates via controlling pyrolysis of a CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor at different temperatures
in N2. During the pyrolysis process of CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 from 400 to 500 °C,
the part of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 converts into
MnCo2O4 accompanied with structural transformation.
The MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500
microspheres as secondary nanomaterials consist of MnSnO3, MnCo2O4, and (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4. Benefiting from the advantages of multicomponent synergy
and porous secondary nanomaterials, the MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 microspheres as anodes exhibit
the specific capacities of 1030 and 750 mA h g–1 until 1000 cycles at 1 A g–1 without an obvious
capacity decay, respectively.

Introduction
Recently,
with the increasing attention on clean energy and more
demand for high energy density of various portable devices and electric
vehicles, green energy storage and conversion devices, such as lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs),1−5 fuel cells,6−10 and supercapacitors,11−14 have been widely
studied and applied. Among them, LIBs have been attracting researchers’
interests because of their high capacity and long cycle life.15−17 In current commercial LIBs, graphite
has been used as a classic anode material because of its excellent
cycle performance and low charging/discharging potential.18,19 However, the disadvantage of its low capacity density limits its
wide application in high-performance LIBs.20,21 Therefore,
the search for a new generation of electrode materials with higher
energy density and excellent cycle stability has become a top priority.22,23 Among the numerous electrode materials for anodes, metal oxides
are expected to be a promising anode material for replacing graphite
because of their high theoretical capacity and good electrochemical
properties.24−26 In
particular, binary metal oxides including cobalt or manganese have
been constantly studied as anodes for next-generation LIBs because
of their high theoretical capacity, low cost, low discharge plateau
(0.3–0.6 V), and synergistic effects.27−29 Yang’s
group reported CoMn2O4 nanofibers via an electrospinning
method combined with
heat treatment, showing a reversible capacity of 526 mA h g–1 at 400 mA g–1 after 50 cycles.30 Mesoporous NiCo2O4 microspheres synthesized
by a facile solvothermal method with pyrolysis could deliver 1198
mA h g–1 after 30 cycles at 200 mA g–1.31 Uniform hierarchical porous MnCo2O4 microspheres were also prepared via a solvothermal
process with a post-annealing treatment, maintaining a specific capacity
of 740 mA h g–1 after 1000 cycles.32 Those porous binary metal oxides as anodes exhibited enhanced
electrochemical properties because of the higher surface area, short
lithium-ion transport pathway, and synergistic effect between cobalt
and manganese oxides. However, further improvement of their electrochemical
performances is still required for extensive practical application.

On the other hand, tin-based materials such as SnO2,33,34 Zn2SnO4,35 Co2SnO4,36 and ASnO3 (A = Mn, Zn, Ca, and Co)37,38 are also other
promising anodes in LIBs, owing to their high theoretical capacities
and rich electrochemical activities. Like most of the metal oxide
electrode materials, the large volume variations during alloying or
conversion reactions could cause the pulverization of electrodes,
eventually leading to capacity deterioration and poor cycle performance.
In order to overcome these thorny problems, it is a more effective
strategy to construct a unique pore micro/nanostructure material or
to introduce buffer matrices. One of the more mature methods in research
is to design micro/nanostructured materials by self-assembly adapting
to the volume expansion of lithium-ion insertion/extraction, such
as porous microstructures,39 nanotubes,23 and nanospheres.13 In addition, the hybridization of different composition nanostructured
tin oxide, cobalt oxide, solid-solution CoSnO3, MnSnO3, and Co2SnO4 has also been studied
to achieve the expected electrochemical performances for lithium-ion
storage.40−42 A hollow CoO-in-CoSnO3 nanostructure constructed
by atomic layer deposition could
maintain a specific capacity of 695.7 mA h g–1 after
100 cycles as an anode material of LIBs.43 However, there is no report on the hybridization of Mn–Co
metal oxides and tin-based oxides to improve their electrochemical
performances through the multicomponent synergy. Therefore, it is
very interesting to design and synthesize a multicomponent metal oxide
including cobalt, manganese, and tin and to further study their electrochemical
properties.

Herein, we will report porous heterogeneous multicomponent
Mn–Sn–Co oxide microspheres (MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500) fabricated by a solvothermal process
followed with controlling pyrolysis of CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor at different temperatures
in nitrogen. As expected, the as-prepared microspheres as anode materials
for LIBs exhibit enhanced electrochemical performances benefiting
from the multicomponent synergy and porous secondary nanomaterials.

Results
and Discussion
Characterizations of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 Microspheres
The schematic
illustration
of the synthesis process of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 is depicted in Scheme 1. The CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were
prepared in a stoichiometric coprecipitation method in an alkaline
aqueous solution containing Sn4+ and Co2+. Then,
the CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were coated with MnCo-carbonate
through a solvothermal treatment to obtain the CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor. During
the solvothermal process, the uniformly mixed microspheres are finally
formed by diffusion because of the difference in the bonding energy
between OH– and CO32– to metal ions. Subsequently, the MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 microspheres were obtained by controlling
pyrolysis of CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 in nitrogen at 400 and 500 °C, respectively.

Scheme 1 Schematic Synthesis of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 Microspheres
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor,
MnSnO3–MC400, and MnSnO3–MC500
are all displayed
to identify their crystallographic structures, as indicated in Figure 1. The pattern of
the CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor can be assigned to Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 (no. 167) and CoSn(OH)6 (JCPDF no. 74-0365).44 For MnSnO3–MC400, an obvious
(112) peak at 33.1° is ascribed to MnSnO3 (JCPDS no.
47-0464); the characteristic peaks at 43.76° and 63.62°
show the (400) and (440) crystal planes of MnCo2O4 (JCPDS no. 23-1237), and other peaks could be indexed as (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 (JCPDS no. 18-0410). However, for MnSnO3–MC500, the (112) peak of MnSnO3 is still
present. The obvious differences are that the (311) and (400) peaks
of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 are converted into MnCo2O4, the (220) and (202) peaks of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 merge into the peak (220) of MnCo2O4, and the (511) peak of MnCo2O4 is formed, indicating that more MnCo2O4 is
generated. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis (Figure S1) was carried out to explore the calcination conditions of
the CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor. The mass loss below 150 °C (a stage) is attributed
to the moisture volatilization, which has been physically and chemically
adsorbed in air and the residual organic solvent volatilization. The
(b) stage is attributed to the decomposition loss of CoSn(OH)6 converted to CoSnO3 and the thermal decomposition
of Co0.5Mn0.5CO3.45 In this process, with the decomposition of Co0.5Mn0.5CO3, the manganese mass gradually increases,
while the electronegativity of Mn (1.5) is lesser than Co (1.8), which
causes CoSnO3 to gradually transform into MnSnO3. It is very interesting to note that there is a weight loss at 400–500
°C (c stage), which is ascribed to the part conversion of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 into MnCo2O4 accompanied
by a small amount of gas release. Thus, the content of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 in MnSnO3–MC400 is higher
than that of MnSnO3–MC500, which could influence
the electrochemical properties (Table S1). Furthermore, the elemental compositions of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 were further confirmed by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS; Figure S2a,b),
and the Co/(Mn + Sn) molar ratio is close to 1:1, being consistent
with the initial reactants.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 and the calcination
products at different temperatures.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) measurement was used to probe the elemental composition and
valence states of the metal ions in MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500. The overall XPS spectra (Figure S3) confirm the presence of Mn, Co, Sn,
and O elements. As displayed in Figure 2a, two peaks observed at 780.4 and 796.1 eV match with
the spin orbit peak of Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 for MnSnO3–MC400, accompanied by two prominent
shake-up satellite peaks at 786.6 and 803.6 eV, respectively, where
Co 2p3/2 at 780.4 eV is close to CoO.41 The binding energy difference between the two spin orbits
and the adjacent satellite peaks is 6.2 and 7.5 eV, respectively,
indicating that the Co element is +3, +4 valence.46 The results confirmed that the Co elements in MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 coexist with
+2, +3, and +4. Figure 2b shows the Mn 3s spectrum showing multiple splitting peaks. It can
be seen that the splitting peak magnitude of the Mn 3s spectrum is
5.43 eV for MnSnO3–MC400 and 5.49 eV for MnSnO3–MC500, showing that the average valence of Mn in MnSnO3–MC400 with +2.7 is higher than that of MnSnO3–MC500 with +2.58.47,48 As shown in Figure 2c,d, Mn 2p3/2 at 641.9 eV and Mn 2p1/2 at 653.6 eV are ascribed to
the Mn 2p spectrum. After refined fitting, the Mn 2p spectrum could
be divided into six peaks. The peaks at 641.5 and 653.4 eV belong
to the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 of Mn2+, and 642.6 and 654.6 eV are attributed to the Mn 2p3/2 and Mn 2p1/2 of Mn3+, respectively.10,19 Furthermore, the other two peaks (642.8 and 654.4 eV) could be ascribed
to Mn4+.45,48Figure 2e,f shows the high-resolution spectra of
Sn 3d for MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500.
The characteristic signals of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 are found to be located at 486.6 and 495 eV for MnSnO3–MC400 and 486.4 and 494.8 eV for MnSnO3–MC500,
indicating the existence of Sn4+.37,49 Besides,
compared with MnSnO3–MC500, the binding energy of
Sn4+ in MnSnO3–MC400 is relatively high.43

The morphologies of the as-synthesized
products were first characterized by the field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FESEM). As exhibited in Figure 3a, the CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes with
the edge around 200 nm could be observed, while the CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor shows microsphere
morphology with a diameter of 700 nm or so after solvothermal treatment
(Figure 3b). Figure 3c,d shows the highly
uniform and rough surface microspheres of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 obtained at 400 and 500 °C
with an average diameter of about ∼650 and 600 nm, respectively.

and (d) MnSnO3–MC500.

To further probe the microstructure of the as-obtained products,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were also studied. As
can be seen in Figure 4a, the CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 microspheres are denser in the middle and sparse in the edges.
To confirm the elemental distribution in the microspheres during the
formation process, the elemental line profiles were determined (Figure 4b). It can be clearly
seen that the tin, cobalt, and manganese elements exist in the whole
microspheres from the core to the outer shell. This is because Co2+ and Sn4+ in CoSn(OH)6 are out-diffused,
and Mn2+ and Co2+ in Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 attract inward because of the stronger binding
energy of OH– to metal ions than CO32– during the formation process of CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 by solvothermal method. Figure 4c,d exhibits the
TEM images of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500. It can be seen that hollow MnSnO3–MC400
has a smaller pore micro/nanostructure than MnSnO3–MC500,
which is very different from their precursor CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 microspheres. More microscopic
details can be observed from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images. It
can be found that the fast Fourier transform (FFT) mode (inset of Figure S4) of the Mn0.5Co0.5CO3/CoSn(OH)6 precursor has CoSn(OH)6 and Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 diffraction rings. Figure 4e,f shows the selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500. Among them, the (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 and MnCo2O4 structures
could be indexed, respectively. As shown in Figure 4g, two distinct lattice spacings of 0.384
and 0.270 nm correspond to the (002) and (112) planes of MnSnO3. In addition, the (111) lattice spacing (0.482 nm) of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 can also be observed. The FFT mode (inset of Figure 4g) converted from
the green square area further confirms the presence of MnSnO3, MnCo2O4, and (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 diffraction rings. In Figure 4h, the HRTEM image, the (202) lattice spacing (0.301
nm) of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4, the (112) lattice
spacing (0.270 nm) of MnSnO3, and the (111) lattice spacing
(0.478 nm) of MnCo2O4 can be clearly observed.
It can be concluded that MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 all contain (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4, MnCo2O4, and MnSnO3. It
should be noted that the difference between MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 is the content of (Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4, resulting in the difference of electrochemical
properties. The elemental mapping of Figure 4i,j shows that Mn, Co, Sn, and O are uniformly
distributed in the microspheres.

images of (g) MnSnO3–MC400 and (h) MnSnO3–MC500; and elemental mappings of (i) MnSnO3–MC400
and (j) MnSnO3–MC500.

N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm curves were also applied to study the surface areas and pore
size properties of the MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 microspheres. As can be seen in Figure S5a,b, the isotherm curves of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 could be
classified as type IV with a type H1 hysteresis loop, indicating that
their structures are mesoporous.50 According
to the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda plots (inset
of Figure S5a,b), the average pore sizes
of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500
are about 12.12 and 21.26 nm, respectively, confirming that the two
samples contain mesoscale pores. It may be noted that the different
pore size could cause a difference in the electrochemical properties
for MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas and pore
volumes of the MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 were 53.213 m2 g–1 and
0.205 cm3 g–1, and 55.869 m2 g–1 and 0.283 cm3 g–1, respectively.

Electrochemical Properties
The electrochemical
performances of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 as anodes for LIBs were investigated. Figure 5a,b exhibits the
first three cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 at a rate of 0.2 mV s–1 in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V. As exhibited in Figure 5a, in the first cycle,
the smaller reduction peak around 1.85 V is ascribed to the reduction
of Mn4+ and Co4+ to Mn3+ and Co3+. Three sharp peaks were observed, one peak at 1.2 V could
be ascribed to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Co3+ to Co2+, one sharp peak at 0.69 V
could be attributed to the reduction of Co2+ to metallic
Co, and another sharp peak at 0.51 V is assigned to the reduction
of Mn2+ and Sn4+ to metallic Mn and Sn.44 The peak below 0.5 V is ascribed to the lithiation
of Sn to Li4.4Sn alloys. A small peak at 1.03 V which disappears
in subsequent cycles generally could be assigned to the irreversible
decomposition of the solvent in the electrolyte and the formation
of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI).37 In the anodic scan, two broad oxidation peaks are observed at 0.52
and 0.91 V, corresponding to the delithiation of Li4.4Sn
alloy.51 At the same time, two weak peaks
around 1.34 and 1.81V can be ascribed to oxidation of Sn to Sn4+ and Mn to Mn2+, respectively.52 One broad oxidation peak at 2.08 V is observed, which corresponds
to the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+ and Co to Co2+. In subsequent cycles, the aforementioned peaks at 0.51
and 0.69 V shift to 0.53 and 0.72 V, respectively, which is due to
the fact that the formation of Li2O and metal stimulates
the microstructure of the MnSnO3–MC400 electrode
after the first lithiation process, thereby accelerating the kinetics.53 A reduction peak at 1.12 V can be found, indicating
that part of Mn3+/Mn2+ is reversible. Similar
electrochemical properties of MnSnO3–MC500 are exhibited
in Figure 5b; two obvious
peaks at 0.48 and 0.64 V are found in the first reduction scan, one
could be ascribed to the reduction of Mn2+ to Mn and Sn4+ to Sn and the other could be assigned to the reduction of
Co2+ to Co and the formation of the SEI. In addition, the
peak at 1.9 V is ascribed to the reduction of Mn4+ and
Co4+ to Mn3+ and Co3+, and the peak
at 1.28 V can be ascribed to the reduction of Mn3+ to Mn2+ and Co3+ to Co2+. In the anodic scan,
two broad oxidation peaks at 0.54 and 1.51 V correspond to the delithiation
of Li4.4Sn alloy oxidation and Mn to Mn2+, respectively.54 A peak at 1.28 V that cannot be ignored is attributed
to Sn-oxidation to Sn4+.37 A
strong broad peak at 2.02 V is attributed to the oxidation of Co to
Co2+ and Mn2+ to Mn3+. It is interesting
that the reduction peak at 0.64 V moves to 0.74 V and the peak at
0.48 V moves to 0.51 V in the second and third circles, respectively.
These oxidation/reduction processes can be described as follows 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  

Figure 5 CV curves of
MnSnO3–MC400 (a) and MnSnO3–MC500
(b) between
0.01 and 3.0 vs (Li/Li+)/V at a rate of 0.1 mV s–1, and the charge/discharge curves of (c) MnSnO3–MC400
and (d) MnSnO3–MC500 for the first three cycles
at a current density of 1 A g–1 within the voltage
range of 0.01–3.0 vs (Li/Li+)/V.

The charging/discharging curves of
MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500
for the first three cycles are exhibited in Figure 5c,d at a current density of 1 A g–1. The initial discharge/charge capacities of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 are 1194.2/777.9 mA h g–1 and 1393.1/866.2 mA h g–1 with the initial Coulombic
efficiency of 65.14 and 62.18%, respectively. The capacity loss is
due to the side reaction of the electrolyte and the formation of the
SEI film, resulting in a lower Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle.
It can be clearly seen that the discharge platform is basically the
same as the CV.

Figure 6a shows the cycle stabilities of MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500 at the high rate of 1 A g–1. The capacity fading of MnSnO3–MC400 is seen obviously
from 895.9 mA h g–1 (at the 2nd cycle) to 226.4
mA h g–1 (at the 100th cycle), while MnSnO3–MC500 delivers the capacity from 952.6 mA h g–1 (at the 2nd cycle) to 145.4 mA h g–1 (at the 160th
cycle). Amazingly, after the lowest value, the specific capacity sequentially
increases during the subsequent cycles without further decay. The
specific capacity of MnSnO3–MC400 could deliver
1030 mA h g–1 at the 560th cycle and remain stable
at the 1000th cycle, while MnSnO3–MC500 could show
730 mA h g–1 capacity at the 750th cycle. This phenomenon
is also normal in some porous metal oxides reported.20,53,55 First, it could be attributed
to the reactivation effect induced by high-rate lithiation of porous
metal oxide microspheres during the lithiation/delithiation process.
Before activation, the destruction of the SEI caused by the volume
expansion and the blockage of the electrolyte led to the significant
capacity attenuation.55 After reactivation,
the microspheres were reconstructed as well as the optimizing stable
SEI, resulting in more Co and Mn active sites, are exposed.53 At the same time, the optimizing SEI is also
beneficial to the reversible formation and decomposition of an organic
polymer/gel layer in the electrolyte. Another reason is about the
reversible formation and decomposition of an organic polymeric/gel-like
layer from the electrolyte.

V. The differential charge capacity vs potential curves of (e) MnSnO3–MC400 and (f) MnSnO3–MC500 at different
cycles.

Compared with MnSnO3–MC500,
the specific capacity of MnSnO3–MC400 is higher,
which could be ascribed to the more content ratio of MnCo2O4/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 and the smaller
pore size. SEM tests were also carried out on the recycled electrode
to explore its integrity. As shown in Figure 6b,c, MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 could still maintain the microsphere structure
after a long cycle even at a large current rate. Compared with the
MnSnO3–MC500 electrode, the MnSnO3–MC400
electrode surface has obvious porous pore. This result indicated that
the pores of MnSnO3–MC400 are not blocked, demonstrating
the better cycle stability of MnSnO3–MC400 microspheres
as anode electrodes. The organic polymeric/gel-like layer could form
at low voltage and decompose at high voltage.56 For more detailed electrochemical characteristics, the MnSnO3–MC400 electrodes were tested under the different voltage
range at high-rate current density. Figure 6d shows the cycling performance of the MnSnO3–MC400 anode from 2 to 1 A g–1 at
0.01–3.0 V and 0.01–2.1 V. The specific capacity increases
during the 200th to 450th cycles in the voltage range of 0.01–3.0
V at 1 A g–1 but does not increase when the cutoff
voltage is from 0.01 to 2.1 V. This result may be due to the fact
that the organic polymeric/gel-like layer could not decompose below
2.1 V. As expected, the rising trend could recover after the cutoff
voltage back to 3.0 V. The above results show that the reversible
formation and decomposition of the organic polymeric/gel-like layer
could result in the increase of capacity. Thereafter, the charge differential
capacity curves of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 at different cycle numbers were further verified. As
shown in Figure 6e,f,
it can be seen that the MnSnO3–MC400 electrode exhibits
several sharp peaks at 2.15–2.85 V after 1000 cycles, indicating
the further oxidation of Co2+ or Mn2+. In addition,
a blunt peak appeared at 2.85–3.0 V further indicates the decomposition
of the electrolyte. It should be noted that there is no peak in the
range of 2.85–3.0 V at 300th and 500th cycle of MnSnO3–MC400. Comparing the 10th and 100th cycles in the 2.15–2.85V
and 2.85–3.0 V stages, it was found that the oxidation of Co
and Mn gradually increased before the activation of MnSnO3–MC400 electrode, and the reversible degradation of electrolyte
was continuously suppressed. A sharp peak was observed in the 2.4–3.0
V range of the MnSnO3–MC500 electrode after 10 cycles,
but only a weak blunt peak was observed after 1000 cycles, indicating
that MnSnO3–MC500 was favorable for lithium storage
reaction at the initial cycle stage, and the pore blockage after continuous
cycles was unfavorable for lithium implantation and the reversible
formation and decomposition of organic polymer/gel layer. This is
consistent with the SEM structure of the electrode after circulation.

The comparisons of the electrochemical properties for previous
Co––Mn binary metal oxides, ASnO3 (A = Mn,
Co), and MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500
of this work are displayed in Table S2.
It can be found that MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 as advanced anodes for LIBs exhibit high reversible
capacities and excellent cycle stabilities even at the high rate of
1 A g–1, which may be due to the following reasons:
first, the Co and Mn nanoparticles in Sn/Li2O and LixSn/Li2O matrices after full lithiation could work
as anchors to prohibit the diffusion and coarsening of Sn nanocrystals
during the dealloying process, which could improve the conversion
reaction reversibility between Sn and Li2O during lithiation/delithiation
process.52,57 Second, the appropriate pore size of porous
second nanomaterials could reduce the diffusion paths of Li+ and electrons, which is beneficial to enhance electrochemical kinetics,
and third, the synergistic effect among the multicomponent Mn–Sn–Co
oxides.

To probe the rate capabilities of the electrode, the
charge/discharge tests of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 were also evaluated at different rates from
0.1 to 2 A g–1 (Figure S6). The average discharge capacities of the MnSnO3–MC400
electrode were 1584, 1220, 834, 590, and 403 mA h g–1 at the rates of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g–1,
respectively. Excitingly, when the rate went back to 0.1 A g–1, the discharge capacity of MnSnO3–MC400 could
still return to 1123 mA h g–1, while MnSnO3–MC500 only provided a specific capacity of 286 mA h g–1 at 1 A g–1 and a discharge capacity
of 608 mA h g–1 when the rate went back to 0.1 A
g–1. It can be easily seen that the rate performance
of MnSnO3–MC400 is superior to MnSnO3–MC500. On the basis of the above electrochemical capacity
and rate capabilities, it can be found that the appropriate content
ratio of MnCo2O4/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 is conducive to the capacity retention and rate performance
in the case of a certain content of MnSnO3.

To further
investigate the electrochemical performances, the Nyquist plots of
MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500
electrodes at 1000th cycle are exhibited in Figure S7. As shown in Figure S7, the Nyquist
diagram presents two semicircles and one oblique line corresponding
to the high–medium-frequency and the low-frequency region,
respectively. The equivalent circuit model (inset of Figure S7) consisted of electrolyte resistance (Re), SEI resistance (Rs), charge-transfer
resistance (Rct), Warburg impedance (W1), and two constant phase element.53,58 It can be obviously seen in the fitted impedance parameters of Table S3 that the Rct of MnSnO3–MC400 (210 Ω) at 1000th cycle
is much smaller than that of MnSnO3–MC500 (347 Ω),
showing the faster charge-transfer reaction of MnSnO3–MC400
for Li+ insertion and extraction. Therefore, the electrode
reaction kinetics for MnSnO3–MC400 during charging
and discharging is enhanced, resulting in the improved cycle performance
of the cells.

Conclusions
In summary, the porous
multicomponent heterogeneous microspheres
(MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500)
have been successfully fabricated. As anodes for LIBs, MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500 exhibit the specific
capacities of 750 and 1030 mA h g–1 at 1 A g–1 without obvious capacity decay until 1000 cycles,
respectively. The improved electrochemical properties could be attributed
to the unique porous second micro/nanostructure, the lithiation-induced
high-rate reactivation, and the synergistic effects among the multicomponent
Mn–Sn–Co oxides.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of CoSn(OH)6 Nanocubes
CoSn(OH)6 nanocubes were synthesized
according to a previous report.37 SnCl4·5H2O (0.351 g, 1 mmol) was dissolved in 5
mL of ethanol to form solution A. CoCl2·6H2O (0.238 g, 1 mmol) and sodium citrate (0.294 g) were dissolved in
35 mL of ultrapure water to form solution B. Then, solution A and
solution B were mixed and stirred to form a uniform solution, followed
by dropwise addition of 5 mL of 2 M NaOH solution at room temperature.
After 1 h, a pink precipitate is obtained by centrifuging and washing
via ethanol and water each two times, which was then dried in a vacuum
oven at 60 °C for 12 h.

Synthesis
of MnSnO3–MC400 and MnSnO3–MC500
Microspheres
CoSn(OH)6 (0.1 g), 1.5 mmol MnCl2·4H2O, and 1.5 mmol CoCl2·6H2O were added into 40 mL of ethylene glycol under stirring
to form solution A. Then, 2.0 g of NH4HCO3 was
added into solution A under stirring combined with ultrasonication
(15 min) to form suspension B. The as-obtained suspension B was transferred
to 50 mL Teflon liner with stainless steel autoclaves and kept for
20 h at 200 °C in an oven. The CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 precursor was collected by centrifuging
and washing with ethanol and water each two times. Finally, the dry
precursor was placed in a furnace for 3 h at 400 °C with a 2
°C min–1 rate under the presence of N2 to obtain MnSnO3–MC400. For comparison, porous
MnSnO3–MC500 could be obtained by heating CoSn(OH)6/Mn0.5Co0.5CO3 at 500 °C.

Material Characterization
The
phase composition of the as-synthesized products was characterized
by XRD (Shimadzu XRD-6000, Cu Kα radiation). The surface composition
of the products was evaluated by XPS (PerkinElmer model PHI 5600).
FESEM (JEOL, JSM-6700F) and TEM (FEI TF20 and JEM-2100F) were applied
to analyze the surface and microstructure. TG analysis was carried
on an instrument (Pyris Diamond TG-DTA) in air or N2. Fourier
transform infrared and Raman spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary
660 Fourier transmission infrared and a Renishaw Raman spectrometer,
respectively. The pore volume and surface area of the as-obtained
products were estimated on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 by the BET method
by nitrogen adsorption–desorption at 77 K.

Electrochemical
Measurements
The electrochemical
properties of the porous microspheres (MnSnO3–MC400
and MnSnO3–MC500) were measured via the half-cells
(CR2032). The working electrodes (a diameter of 13 mm) were made of
80 wt % active materials, 10 wt % acetylene black, and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene
difluoride). The loading mass of the as-prepared active materials
on the electrode is about 0.93 mg cm–2. The reference
electrode is lithium foil, and the electrolyte is 1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate and diethylcarbonate (1:1 volume). The galvanostatic
charging/discharging cycle tests were performed on a LAND CT-2001A
system (Wuhan Kingnuo Electronics Co., Ltd., China). Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and CV tests were carried out on an Autolab
302 N and a CHI 760E (Chenhua Ltd. Co., China) electrochemical workstation,
respectively.
