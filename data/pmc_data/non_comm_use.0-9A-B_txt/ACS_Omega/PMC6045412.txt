Protein
structure can be flexible to adopt multiple conformations
to house small molecules. In this paper, we have attempted to experimentally
figure out how the structure of a transport protein steer the drug–drug
competition (DDC) by maintaining the equilibrium distribution of the
bound and unbound fractions of drugs. This understanding is an important
facet in biophysical and medicinal chemistry to ascertain the effectiveness
of drugs. It is important to note that majority of studies involving
small-molecule–transport protein interaction aimed at characterizing
the binding process, and because these proteins can interact with
thousands of molecules, there are hundreds of reports on such interactions.
This ultimately led to an impression among the readers that any studies
involving serum albumin may not lead to any new findings except for
traditional binding explorations. However, in the present paper, we
would like to draw the attention of the readers that our findings
are very surprising, new, and important, involving the phenomenon
of ligand–protein interaction. Here, we have studied two structurally
similar drugs methotrexate (MTX) and folic acid (FA), which attempt
to bind the primary binding site (subdomain IIA), one at a time, of
human serum albumin. Details of binding analyses reveal that when
both of the drugs are present, the single-site binding mode of FA
prefers to occupy the primary binding site and hence pushes the primary-site-bound
MTX to another location (subdomain IIIA), which is the second binding
site of MTX. The structural analysis indicates that DDC has occurred
in a cooperative fashion so that the loss of the protein secondary
structure is minimum when both drugs are bound to the protein, which
means that in the case of duo-drug binding, the conventional interaction
between the drug and the protein is altered to undergo restoration
of the protein structure. This can indeed regulate the DDC by modifying
the bound and unbound fractions of MTX in plasma. The present study
emphasizes that in vitro structural characterizations of the transport
protein provide important information to improve the molecular-level
understanding of DDC for further therapeutic applications with combination
drug.

Introduction
The characterization
of structural flexibility of a protein is
one of the very important aspects to ascertain the biological effects,
binding site location, binding orientation, and binding kinetics of
drugs.1 Protein flexibility permits possible
improvement in the affinity between a drug and its target and traces
the high-affinity interactions with a small drug.1 It is thought that the protein pre-exists as a set of different
conformations in similar energy states. Out of those, one of the conformers
selectively binds the therapeutic agent more efficiently, thereby
increasing the population of the concerned conformer in the whole
bunch, and this indeed guides the conformational modifications, which
ultimately alters the nature of interaction.1 Therefore, it is very crucial to understand the quantitative structure–binding
relationship in a set of structurally related drugs to identify the
intriguing effectiveness of a drug in some selective conditions.

Most of the drugs reversibly bind plasma proteins with substantial
binding efficiencies and may produce some significant effects on the
overall activity profile of the molecule as well as the protein.2,3 Serum albumin (SA) is the major protein constituent of blood plasma,
and it is also found to be considerably distributed in the interstitial
fluid of body tissues. SA is often chosen as a model protein in various
studies because of its high abundance and smaller size.3,4 It can reversibly bind and deliver a number of relatively insoluble
endo- and exogenous compounds through blood circulation.3,5,6 SA can affect pharmacokinetic
profile by restricting the unbound drug concentration, thereby altering
the distribution and elimination.5,6 Human serum
albumin (HSA, Scheme 1) has a limited number of active sites for drug accumulation, and
they are subdomains IIA, IIIA, and IB.6,7 Among these,
subdomains IIA and IIIA are located in hydrophobic cavities, which
are regarded as principal regions for binding of drugs and ligands.
Besides, in some cases, the ligand binds subdomain IB, which is referred
to as site III.7 As metabolism and transportation
of drugs are important components for drug efficiency, the role of
a carrier protein always needs to be realized quite well.5 In this context, drug–protein interaction
in a binary system (interaction of one type of drug with protein)
is very common and very well-documented in the literature. In most
of the cases, the respective drugs are found to affect the protein
secondary structure by conformational induction.8 This type of information is very useful to ascertain the
binding efficiency of the drug. The nature of conformational induction
is different for different types of drugs, even for structurally similar
drugs. For enzymatic proteins, conformational induction is known to
be responsible for displaying agonist and antagonist behaviors. However,
it is very inconvenient to understand the nature of interaction and
the possible fate of the protein structure in the presence of a cocktail
of drugs. Interaction of drugs with protein depends upon various factors,
but among them, the drug–drug competition (DDC) for the same
binding site can also be very crucial in pharmacokinetic and activity
profiles. The competition of two drugs for the same pocket of a protein
is sometimes referred to as drug–drug interactions (DDIs),
and it is thought that such interactions cause undesired adverse (side)
effects, such as toxicity or loss of therapeutic properties.9 Moreover, it is considered that if two drugs
bind in close proximity to one another, the stronger binding drug
shows a narrow therapeutic effect.10 In
many instances, DDI has been purposely utilized to increase the free
concentration of the weaker binding drug. For example, the anticoagulant
activity of warfarin is known to be enhanced by the coadministered
anti-inflammatory drugs, such as phenylbutazone/bucolome.11 Importantly, these drugs bind the same pocket
(in subdomain IIA) of HSA, and all of these studies have been performed
with respect to the drug-binding efficiency. Therefore, the role of
the protein structure to anticipate the multiple-drug binding, more
specifically the DDC, needs to be explored in detail.

In this
regard, the drugs have been chosen for exploration of the
structural fate of protein are folic acid (FA) and methotrexate (MTX),
a common pair of supplementary drugs having a quite similar structure
(Scheme 1). These drugs
are known to be the main competitors for the same binding site in
subdomain IIA of SA.12,13 Therefore, we can expect to observe
a DDC here. MTX has been widely used as a disease-modifying antirheumatic
drug in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and also used in
various types of cancers, such as leukemia, lymphoma, and bone cancer.
MTX interferes with the supply of folates by inhibiting the action
of dihydrofolate reductase. At high doses, it has a considerable effect
on the purine and pyrimidine biosyntheses, contributing to its usefulness
in many malignancies, and at low doses (<20 mg/week), it is also
beneficial in treating RA. However, the mechanism of action of MTX
is not yet understood fully. Folate antagonism and folate deficiency
are the major adverse effects of low-dose MTX in patients with RA.
FA or folinic acid is often coadministered with MTX as a folate supplementation
to minimize adverse effects (e.g., stomatitis, gastrointestinal intolerance,
bone marrow toxicity, and abnormal liver function tests). Again, Whittle
et al. proposed that folate supplements do not appear to significantly
reduce the effectiveness of MTX in the treatment of RA.14 These supplemental FA offsets can be useful
for reducing the risk of cardiovascular problems of RA patients, but
they promote the possibility of risk factor of hyperhomocysteinemia
through abnormally increasing the level of homocysteine in blood.
Furthermore, MTX toxicity and efficacy with the FA dose still remain
debatable, and the effect of different doses of FA is also unknown.
Now, with respect to this study, the drug having a stronger force
for adherence can reside on the binding site longer and should be
responsible for the induced structural change of the receptor protein.
As a result, the interaction will be modulated through the alteration
of the equilibrium distribution of the bound and unbound ligands.
In this context, it would be very fascinating to assess the changes
in the binding characteristics of the drug in the presence of the
carrier protein SA and the competitive binding aspects of the drugs
to be housed in the same protein pocket. In this regard, the understanding
of the structural modification of receptors caused by DDC can have
immense biochemical relevance.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of (a) MTX and
(b) FA and (c) Crystal Structure
of HSA (PDB ID 1AO6) with Possible Binding Locations
Results and Discussion
Herein, the steady-state absorption
spectra of MTX and FA have
been recorded as a function of HSA concentration. At pH 7.4, FA shows
two distinct peaks at around 280 and 350 nm, whereas MTX shows three
peaks at around 258, 303, and 372 nm.15Figure 1 indicates
that with increasing HSA, FA shows a substantial bathochromic shift
(by ∼21 nm) in the absorbance spectra. However, in the case
of MTX, its absorption spectra are very little red-shifted (by ∼2
nm) (the inset of Figure 1). This type of observations can easily be explained by the
protonation/deprotonation of dissociable groups available in the drug
molecule. Many of these dissociations are directly reflected in the
ultraviolet absorbance changes, and depending upon the pH, MTX and
FA may exist in different ionic forms.15 FA generally exhibits four prototropic forms (bicationic, cationic,
neutral, and anionic), whereas MTX shows only three forms (bicationic,
cationic, and neutral). Because of the lack of amide moieties in MTX,
not much change in the absorption bands has been observed in between
the pH values 7.4 and 9.8 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). However, a substantial shift in the absorbance
maxima (from 350 to 370 nm) is observed in the case of FA, and as
its pKa is around 8.38, the transition
from the neutral to the anionic form is expected to occur above pH
8.5. This is the pH range in which the assigned dissociation of acidic
proton of the amide group of pterin occurs. These results clearly
indicate that FA gets incorporated into the protein pocket, accompanying
a shift of its prototropic equilibrium from the neutral to the anionic
form.

Figure 1 Absorption spectra of FA (10 μM) in the presence of HSA (0–100
μM) at pH 7.4. The inset shows the absorption spectra of MTX
(10 μM) in the presence of HSA (0–100 μM).

Now, in the excited electronic
state with increasing protein concentration,
the fluorescence of the drugs (MTX and FA) is progressively quenched
without a shift of the emission maxima (Figure S2, Supporting Information). It has already been observed elsewhere4 that the prototropic behavior of the drug molecule
has a significant role in drug–protein interaction in the ground
state. We have also explored the fluorescence emission of MTX and
FA at various pH values (Figure S3, Supporting Information). At pH 7.4, FA shows a considerably high fluorescence
intensity, but with further increase of pH, no additional change is
observed. Therefore, it may be stated that the ground-state prototropic
properties do not appear to have a considerable role in the excited-state
properties here and the observed quenching of emission is the signature
of the formation of a HSA–drug complex. With increasing concentration
of HSA, the extent of quenching of FA is found to be more than that
of MTX. Moreover, the steady-state anisotropy study furnishes the
similar findings, where at the point of saturation, the anisotropy
values are 0.22 and 0.25 for MTX and FA, respectively (Figure S4, Supporting Information). This clearly indicates
that FA experiences a more rigid environment than MTX, which is presumably
due to its higher binding affinity compared to MTX. Excited-state
lifetime measurement also highlights the possible binding nature in
the micro-heterogeneous pocket of protein.16 Here, the average lifetime (τavg) values of both
MTX and FA progressively decrease with protein concentration, and
an enhancement of nonradiative channels indicates the possible involvement
of surrounding protein residues with MTX and FA (Supporting Information). The biexponential rotational correlation
time (θr) of FA in the presence of HSA indicates
the existence of an equilibrium between two prototropic forms in solution,
and a high θr value (5.39 ns) of the slow component
reveals that the anionic form has greater binding power than the neutral
form, whereas MTX remains mostly in the neutral form as it is unable
to get converted to the anionic form in the presence of HSA. This
form is housed loosely in the protein cavity (as evident from a low
θr value, 1.34 ns) as compared to the anionic form
of FA (2.28 ns). These results indicate the higher binding affinity
of FA over MTX with HSA (Supporting Information). We have determined the binding stoichiometry for both the drugs
using the Job’s method,17 and it
is found to be 1:2.33 for the MTX–HSA complex and 1:1 for the
FA–HSA complex (Figure S7, Supporting Information). These results suggest that HSA can simultaneously bind two MTX
molecules, whereas occupied site by FA in HSA is only one.

As
we have seen that the properties of MTX and FA are greatly modulated
in the presence of HSA, either way, it is also important to understand
the changes of spectral properties of the protein, namely, the fluorescence
of tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) in the presence of these drugs.
HSA consists of only one Trp residue, and this Trp is located in the
important subdomain IIA ligand-binding site at amino acid position
214. As the understudied drugs in a binary system bind subdomain IIA,
the selective excitation at 295 nm can extract the information on
the change in the binding blueprints nearer to that region. We have
studied the combined behavior of Trp and Tyr (λex = 280 nm) in the presence of these drugs as well.

Now, with
increasing concentration of MTX or FA in the presence
of HSA, the fluorescence intensity (λex = 280 and
295 nm) is progressively quenched with a slight blue shift in the
emission maxima (Figure S8, Supporting Information). This characteristic quenching is due to the incorporation of a
drug molecule in the protein pocket. From this, we can estimate the
binding constants of the two drugs with HSA, and the binding constant
has been determined by the modified Scatchard method as follows:12,18 1  where r is the number of
ligand molecules to one protein molecule; [Lf] is the free
(unbound) ligand concentration; n is the number of
binding sites in a protein molecule (binding stoichiometry), which
corresponds to the mean number of drug molecules bound in the independent
class of drug-binding sites in an albumin molecule; and Ka is the binding constant. The binding plots (Figure 2a) suggest that binding
of MTX with HSA takes place by involving two types of binding sites,
whereas FA binds a single site. Table 1 highlights that the binding constants (Ka) for the MTX–HSA complex are equal to (1.64 ±
0.11) × 105 for the first binding site and (0.16 ±
0.02) × 105 M–1 for the second binding
site with stoichiometries of (0.36 ± 0.04) and (2.21 ± 0.14),
respectively. Maciążek-Jurczyk et al. also concluded
similar binding patterns of the MTX–HSA complex in a different
drug cocktail pair, and they have observed a quite high binding affinity
in the first binding site.12 They proposed
that subdomain IIA is the higher affinity site for MTX, and a decrease
of Ka with increasing the number of other
drug molecules (phenylbutazone) has also been observed for the MTX–HSA
complex.12

The
one-site binding of FA is primarily associated in subdomain
IIA (Figure 2b)13 with Ka and n being (0.87 ± 0.08) × 105 M–1 and 1.02 ± 0.07, respectively (Table 1). This indicates that MTX shows a higher
binding affinity with a small bound fraction in subdomain IIA, whereas
FA binds only to this site of HSA.

Again, excitation at 280
nm provides very similar information about
the binding processes (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The binding constants of MTX are found to be around (1.66 ±
0.12) × 105 M–1 for the first binding
site and (0.16 ± 0.02) × 105 M–1 for the second site with stoichiometries of 0.34 and 2.39, respectively.
On the other hand, FA shows single-site (n ≈
1.00) occupancy with a binding constant of (0.86 ± 0.04) ×
105 M–1. These results clearly suggest
that Tyr residues do not participate or have only minimal effects
in the interaction process. Modulation of binding efficiencies of
one drug molecule in the presence of another structurally similar
drug or a second drug molecule can be of great significance in the
pharmacokinetic behavior of the concerned drug in relation to drug
stability and sustained delivery.9Table 1 and Figure S10, Supporting Information indicate that the binding
affinities of the MTX–HSA complex in the presence of FA differ
substantially from the binary system (absence of FA), whereas the
FA–[MTX]–HSA (in the ternary system, the concentration
of MTX is fixed) complex does not differ much from the corresponding
binary system. Now, in the case of the MTX–[FA]–HSA
system, n of MTX for the first binding site increases
slightly (from 0.36 to 0.58) with a decrease in the Ka value [from (1.64 ± 0.11) × 105 to (0.78 ± 0.09) × 105]. On the other hand,
in the second site, the binding constant increases (from (0.16 ±
0.02) × 105 to (0.75 ± 0.06) × 105 M–1) gradually with a considerable decrease in
the binding stoichiometry (from n = 2.21 ± 0.14
to 0.56 ± 0.06). From the binding characteristics of the FA–[MTX]–HSA
complex, shown in Table 1, it is evident that MTX (even at a higher concentration of 30 μM)
shows a nominal effect on the FA–HSA binding affinities and
also the stoichiometry does not alter much. Therefore, FA binds stronger
with HSA in subdomain IIA (also evident from previous studies), and
this is not affected by MTX. Because in the presence of FA, the binding
of the MTX–HSA complex gets decreased, this implies that one
site (subdomain IIA) is arriving at saturation by FA and this causes
difficulty for MTX to form a complex with HSA. In fact, FA blocks
the principal binding site (subdomain IIA) of MTX and forces it to
occupy the other site nearer to subdomain IIA (seems to be subdomain
IIIA).12 It has been previously reported
that subdomain IIA is primarily regarded as the anion receptor pocket,
and many exogenous ligands bind there in the form of anionic species
from the neutral state via pKa shifting.4,19 In the previous section, we have mentioned that HSA binds FA principally
in the form of folate (the anionic form) and MTX in the neutral form.
Therefore, it is evident that the formation of folate is playing the
key role here for its encapsulation over MTX in subdomain IIA. On
the other hand, because the subdomain IIIA pocket is generally surrounded
by hydrophobic residues, this binding process is principally manifested
by π–π type of interaction between the drug and
the protein via formation of a sandwichlike complex. Furthermore,
we have also performed docking analysis to understand the binding
location and associated forces between drugs and HSA (discussed in
detail in the Supporting Information).
The docking results aptly support the experimental findings, where
in a ternary system, FA and MTX are found to bind subdomains IIA and
IIIA, respectively, and it is found to bind nearer to Trp 214 (∼4–10
Å). In subdomain IIA, the presence of some charged amino acid
side chains around FA confers the stabilization of anionic folate,
whereas in the IIIA pocket, predominance of hydrophobic residues craves
that the binding mode for MTX should be, by and large, π–π
type.

Now, we have investigated how the dual-drug binding affects
the
protein structure in contrast to single-drug-binding processes. For
that, we have used infrared (IR) (Figure S14, Supporting Information) and UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic
methods as a function of composition of MTX and FA in a mixture in
the presence of HSA. The observed α-helical content (from IR
and CD studies) of free HSA is ∼53%, which is in good agreement
with the reported results.20 From IR studies,
it is found that with the addition of MTX and FA, the α-helical
content of HSA has been substantially decreased (from 53 to 39 and
44% for FA and MTX, respectively), following some alteration of the
β-sheet content (from 16 to 31 and 29% for FA and MTX, respectively)
or the coil structure (from 8 to 5 and 22% for FA and MTX, respectively)
and in the presence of cocktail of both drugs, these percentages are
not much affected (change of the α-helical content from 53 to
51%) (Figure 3). Likewise,
in the CD studies, the α-helical content is found to decrease
(from 52.71 to 50.83 and 52.19% for MTX and FA, respectively) with
the addition of drugs and the extent of loss of the secondary structure
is more in the case of MTX than that in FA, although FA unfolded the
protein secondary structure in a lesser extent (Table S4, Supporting Information). In connection with dual
binding, we varied the FA and MTX concentrations in terms of mole
fraction over a fixed HSA concentration. It is found that at the same
molar ratio of these drugs, ternary system imposes less effect (the
change in the α-helical content is only ∼0.3%) on the
protein secondary structure than the binary system (the inset of Figure 3). The difference
in the values of α-helical content of the drug–protein
complex of IR and CD methods may be due to the different sampling
concentration and dissimilar analysis procedure. These results indicate
that here HSA can retain its original structure by partial refolding
or preventing the structural loss (unfolding) in the presence of cocktail
of drugs. It is previously reported that competitive drug binding
has a strong impact on the protein structure.21 However, in most of the cases, competitive drug binding significantly
modifies the protein structure, and in many instances, it accompanies
the impairment of the activity of the bio-macromolecule. Herein, the
results clearly report the refurbishment/reconstruction of the HSA
secondary structure in the presence of a drug cocktail, where FA facilities
MTX to occupy a different site (subdomain IIIA), maintaining the helical
content (in a cooperative manner) intact, which is very much like
a free unperturbed protein or in a less perturbed form. In other words,
here, DDC signifies the drug-mediated partial refolding (repair) of
the protein structure, where one drug eliminates other drug from its
active binding site via maintaining the equilibrium distribution of
bound and unbound fractions.10 This type
of structural reconstruction due to dual binding reports a new challenging
aspect of conformational adaptation of HSA through DDC. It is reported
that the conformational/structural flexibility allows the protein
to adopt multiple conformations of an approximately similar energy
to accommodate a variety of ligands or drugs.1,22 The
number of domains of a protein is very limited toward binding of drugs,
and in most of the cases to accumulate the drug, the more affinity
conformer of the protein can be responsible. This may lead to the
structural changeover of HSA. However, in the presence of cocktail
of drugs, the residues of HSA face many types of interaction, and
here the protein gets a chance to attain more preferable conformation,
by manipulating this interaction through changing the binding affinity
of drugs. In other words, out of many possible conformations in solution,
the most potent conformation will automatically be selected by the
cocktail of drugs, which is as per the right energetics. Furthermore,
a recent report depicts the binding pattern of diclofenac (Dic) and
naproxen (Nps) with equine SA, where both drugs hold two binding sites
with one common location (the preferable binding site) and in competitive
binding mode Nps occupy the most preferable binding site without affecting
the other site of Dic.23 This infers that
combined application of both
drugs may result in increased concentration of free Dic in plasma. Figure 4a shows that with
increasing the amount of fixed FA, the bound MTX concentration decreases
with gradually increasing concentration of the unbound form of MTX.
Also, the binding stoichiometry of MTX is found to decrease substantially
(Figure 4b). Hence,
the present study paves the utility of combination-drug delivery,
where the effective unbound concentration of MTX will increase with
increasing the concentration of folate in plasma.

Figure 3 Change in α-helical
content (%) of HSA as a function of composition
of MTX and FA mixture from IR study. The inset indicates the change
in α-helical content (%) of HSA with variation of the composition
of MTX and FA from CD study.

Figure 4 Change in (a) bound MTX concentration and (b) the number of binding
sites (n) in the presence of various amounts of fixed
FA.

Now, it is important to look into
the possible implication of delivery
of MTX–FA as a combination drug in the treatment of RA. Researchers
suggest that in many ways, FA supplementations are required for patients
with RA during treatment with MTX.24−27 However, American College of
Rheumatology has not strongly recommended the FA or folinic acid supplementation
to prevent the complications with MTX in the therapy of RA.25 As FA and MTX both compete for the same pocket
of the transporter to get absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract
and cellular uptake, it is likely that the reversal of anti-inflammatory
effects of MTX by high doses of FA results in the diminished MTX uptake
in those patients, so patients taking FA are advised to skip their
FA doses for a period around the day that they take their MTX.25 However, the present study suggests that SA
can transport these drugs simultaneously and more importantly folate
in plasma helps to maintain the bound fraction of MTX. Therefore,
from the above results, we can state that combination of these drugs
should be useful in the aforementioned contexts.

Conclusions
In
summary, the present work explores the nature of competitive
binding of a drug pair in terms of structural modification of HSA.
For that, we have used MTX and FA, a well-known supplementary drug
pair for the treatment of RA. The results provide a comprehensive
insight of duo-binding feature with respect to single-drug binding
by refurbishing the protein structure toward the less perturbed state.
It signifies how the protein structure governs the drug binding in
the presence of a cocktail of drugs and hence maintains the bound
and unbound fractions. The results suggest that MTX prefers to bind
within two locations simultaneously, whereas FA is found to bind in
only subdomain IIA. In this site, these two drugs show strong binding
affinities with different stoichiometries. However, FA binds as folate
via shifting the prototropic equilibrium, providing better rigidity
at the site of interaction than MTX. In the ternary system, the binding
of MTX is found to be largely affected in the presence of FA. In that
case, FA holds the primary binding site (subdomain IIA) strongly and
forces MTX to leave the high-affinity binding site subdomain IIA.
Subsequently, MTX prefers to occupy the second site with increasing
the binding efficiency, followed by a decrease in the number of bound
drug fractions. As a consequence, the elimination of excess MTX is
facilitated as a free fraction, which can be important for curing
RA. Interestingly, it has been found that single-drug binding causes
slight unfolding of the protein structure and in the presence of both
the drugs, the altered protein secondary structure for single-drug
binding is substantially repaired/restored in reference to the free
protein. This result indicates that in the presence of a cocktail
of drugs, protein modifies the interactions in such a way that the
flexible nature of this protein molecule allows the retention of the
secondary structure from the perturbed state by regulating the DDC.

Experimental
Section
Materials
MTX, HSA (fatty acid-free), and FA were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and Himedia and used as received. Methanol (UV
spectroscopic grade) and NaOH [analytical reagent (AR) grade] were
purchased from Spectrochem, India, and Merck, India, respectively,
and all other chemicals were of AR grade. Ultrapure Milli-Q water
was used throughout the study. All solutions were prepared in 5 mM
sodium phosphate buffer of pH 7.4 (±0.1). The pH measurements
were made with a precalibrated EUTECH pH 510 ion pH meter.

Sample
Preparation
The stock solution of MTX was prepared
in methanol, and during the study, methanol was evaporated prior to
the addition of buffer solution. Solubility of FA in methanol was
quite low, so we prepared the stock solution of FA in water by making
its salt by the addition of equivalent amount of NaOH solution.

Instrumentation and Methods
UV–vis absorption
spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2600 absorption spectrophotometer
by scanning the solution in the cuvette against the solvent reference
in the wavelength range 250–600 nm at 298 K with the help of
a TCC-260 thermoelectrically temperature-controlled cell holder.

Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a HORIBA Jobin
Yvon spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog-3) equipped with a temperature-controlled
water-cooled cuvette holder kept at 298 K. Two types of quartz cuvettes
(1 and 0.4 cm path length) were used for scanning. The experimentally
measured fluorescence intensity was corrected for background fluorescence
and inner filter effect at both the excitation and emission wavelengths
as described elsewhere,28 using the following
expression: 2  Here, Ficor is the corrected
fluorescence
intensity, Fi is the experimentally measured
fluorescence intensity, Fb is the background
fluorescence intensity, L is path length of the cuvette
used, and Aex and Aem are the absorbances of the sample at the excitation and
emission wavelengths for the ith component, respectively.

Steady-state anisotropy (r) measurements were
performed with the HORIBA Jobin Yvon spectrofluorometer (Fluorolog-3).
The steady-state anisotropy (r0) was expressed
as follows: 3   4  where IVV and IVH are the emission intensities
collected from
the sample when the excitation polarizer is oriented vertically and
the emission polarizer is placed vertically and horizontally, respectively. G is the correction factor for the instrument (also called G-factor of the instruments) and is estimated by keeping
the excitation polarizer horizontal and the emission polarizer vertical
and horizontal.

Fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) of MTX
and FA was estimated
using quinine sulfate as a secondary standard probe (Φ = 0.55
in 0.1 N H2SO4),29 by employing the following equation: 5  where S and R represent the parameters of
the studied sample and reference, respectively; A indicates the area of the fluorescence curve; Abs denotes the absorption
of the sample; and n is the refractive index of the
medium.

The fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed
using a time-correlated
single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer from Edinburgh Instrument
Ltd. (U.K.). In this present work, the samples were excited at 376
(±10) nm using a picosecond laser diode (EPL-375, pulse width
∼67.9 ps) as an exciting source and a high-speed photomultiplier
tube (H10720-01, photosensor module from Hamamatsu) detector was used
for collecting signals at a magic angle of 54.7°. All fluorescence
decays were analyzed by F900 software from Edinburgh Instruments,
with an appropriate decay function considering a χ2 value close to 1, which was an indication of goodness of fit. The
amplitude average lifetimes of the samples were estimated by employing
a multiexponential decay function, using the following equation: 6  where ai is the pre-exponential
term of ith component
of τ.

Time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy decays were
also measured
with the aforementioned TCSPC setup with the same laser diode. In
this process, parallel [I∥(t)] and perpendicular [I⊥(t)] emission polarizations were collected after
excitation by a vertical excitation polarizer. Then, the rotational
correlation time (θr) can be estimated utilizing
the following equations: 7   8  Here, r(t) and rlim (limiting anisotropy) represent
the anisotropy decay function and the inherent depolarization of the
fluorophore, respectively, and air is the pre-exponential term of ith system
of θr.

The available crystal structures of
HSA (PDB ID: 1AO6)30 in protein data bank were used for
docking studies. To
get the lowest energy optimized drug–protein structure, we
followed the detailed computational method discussed in our earlier
report.4 Uncomplexed proteins and their
docked conformations (poses) with TZ of lowest energy were used for
the calculation of solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) using the
Discovery Studio Visualizer 4 from Accelrys Software Inc. The change
in SASA (ΔSASA) for a residue was estimated as ΔSASA =
SASAprotein – SASAprotein–drug.

CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco-815 automatic recording
spectropolarimeter
at 298 K at a scan speed of 50 nm/min by averaging three successive
scans over a wavelength range of 190–260 nm. A quartz cell
having a path length of 0.1 cm was used during the study, and each
spectrum was corrected with the baseline for an appropriate buffer
solution. Typical CD spectra of HSA exhibit two negative bands at
around 208 and 222 nm in the ultraviolet region, recognized as a characteristic
band for the α-helical structure.20 CD measurements were performed in the presence of different concentrations
of MTX and FA, and the data were expressed in mean residual ellipticity
(MRE) in deg cm2 dmol–1, according to
the following equation:20 9  Here, cp is the
molar concentration of the protein, nr is the number of amino acid residues of the protein, and l is the path length. The α-helical contents of free
and ligand-bound HSA can be calculated from the MRE values at 208
nm using the following equation: 10  Here, MRE208 is the experimental
MRE value of proteins at 208 nm, and the contribution of the MRE value
of β form and random coil conformation at that particular point
is 4000. Also, at 208 nm, the MRE value of a pure α-helix is
33 000.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
studies were conducted
using Thermo Scientific FT-IR spectrometers equipped with a deuterated
triglycine sulfate detector and a KBr beam splitter using AgBr windows
at room temperature (∼25 °C). For each spectrum, a 64-scan
interferogram was collected in a single-beam mode with a 2 cm–1 resolution at room temperature. The reference spectrum
was recorded under identical conditions with only the corresponding
buffer in the cell. The protein spectra were processed using a previously
established protocol.31 The region of 1000–1800
cm–1 in the spectra was baseline-corrected and normalized.
The region of 1600–1700 cm–1 corresponding
to the amide I band was extracted for analysis. Second-derivative
spectra were obtained using a seven-point baseline-corrected Savitzky–Golay
derivative function, and the amide I band was area-normalized as described
in the literature.31 The secondary structure
content of the protein was calculated by curve-fitting analysis of
the inverted second-derivative amide I band from 1600 to 1700 cm–1. The fraction of amino acid residues comprising each
secondary structural element was proportional to the relative percent
area of the associated C=O vibrational bands.
