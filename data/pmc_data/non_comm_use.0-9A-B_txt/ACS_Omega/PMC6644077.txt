Limoncello, the Italian
liquor based on lemon essential oils, is
becoming increasingly popular around the world. This digestive is
not only an iconic representative of Italian food culture, but it
is also a complex colloidal system, made of essential oils, ethanol,
sucrose, and water. Smell, aroma, taste, and appearance of Limoncello
do, of course, depend on the components, in particular on the peculiar
essential oil mixture. Accordingly, several studies are available
in the literature investigating the composition of various Limoncellos.
However, the microscopic structure plays an equally important role
when it comes to the sensory properties of food and beverages. In
this work, small-angle neutron scattering was used to probe the microscopic
structure of Limoncello, revealing the presence of spontaneously formed
100 nm-sized droplets over a large range of composition and temperature.
The results are not limited to this famous drink but can be extended
to the rapidly developing formulations based on water-insoluble oils,
water, and alcohols.

Introduction
It is no exaggeration
to say that almost every festive meal in
southern Italy is crowned with a frozen glass of Limoncello, the famous
Italian liquor renowned for its flavor and neon-yellow color. The
traditional recipe foresees that the citrus zest, obtained by scraping
the outer part of the lemon peels, is kept macerating in 95% vol ethanol
for several (4–8) weeks. The zest, or flavedo, contains most
of the essential oils giving rise to the characteristic taste and
color of the liquor. The ethanolic extract is then filtered and diluted
with a sucrose/water syrup previously prepared. Usually, the liquor
contains ca. 30% vol of alcohol and ca. 20% vol of sucrose. However,
the preparation procedure and exact final composition vary from family
to family. Limoncello is also largely produced on an industrial scale,
with an estimate of 15 million liters commercialized in 2003.1 Three million liters were produced using the
IGP lemon of Sorrento in 2017, according to the local consortium.

To assess the genuineness and quality of commercial Limoncellos,
several analytical procedures have been developed.1−5 Different studies performed on commercial Limoncellos
reveal that, in several cases, the final product has never been in
direct contact with the lemon peel, but it is rather a mixture of
citrus essential oils, alcohol, water, and sucrose.2,4 Multiple
reasons are found for the rare employment of the traditional and time-consuming
procedure, in addition to the obvious economic aspect. The composition
of the lemon essential oil, extracted from the citrus flavedo, can
vary significantly as a function of the harvest period and the growth
location,6 making a production of the liquor
with constant organoleptic properties difficult. Moreover, Crupi et
al. found evidence that commercial liquors were prepared using terpeneless
oils or essential oils enriched with citral,4 possibly to avoid or reduce oxidative processes and to enhance the
liquor flavor and shelf-life.

In this work, the focus is put
on the microscopic structure of
Limoncello, rather than on its chemical composition. While the chemical
composition is essentially determining the flavor of liquor, the microstructure
of food and beverages strongly affects the sensory perception during
tasting, on its shelf-life, and on the optical appearance.7−12 From a physicochemical perspective, the Limoncello is a mixture
of hydrophobic essential oils extracted from the lemon flavedo, ethanol,
water, and sucrose. Similar ternary, or pseudo-ternary mixtures, formed
by two partly miscible liquids (the water/sucrose syrup and the essential
oil) and a common solvent, such as ethanol, exhibit strong composition
fluctuations close to the phase-separation boundary,13−17 that is, the mixtures become inhomogeneous both at the microscopic
and macroscopic level, thus turning often turbid. This effect is commonly
observed upon water addition to anise-flavored spirits, such as pastis,
absinthe, raki, or ouzo, hence the name of “ouzo-effect”.18 Furthermore, the effect is not limited to alcoholic
beverages, it is also exploited for the development of reaction media
and promising drug delivery systems.19−22 The size of the clusters strongly
depends on the composition of the mixture and varies between a few
nanometers in the so-called pre-ouzo region (thermodynamically stable
and transparent) to micrometer-sized domains which exhibit slow phase
separation in the ouzo region. It is noteworthy that there exists
different designations in the literature to describe these systems,
the two most common being surfactant-free emulsions, to distinguish
them from the conventional cases of two immiscible liquids stabilized
by surfactant molecules20,23 or ultraflexible microemulsions,
to highlight the exceptionally low rigidity of the droplet interface.24,25

The characterization of the microstructure of Limoncello was
performed
using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), a very powerful technique
for studying the structure of soft condensed matter in the range of
Å (10–10 m) to μm (10–6 m), which was already successfully employed in similar ouzo-systems.21,25,26 However, because of the high
complexity of real food products, the use of scattering techniques
is mostly limited to simplified, abstracted representations thereof.27−30 In this study, the microstructure of “real” Limoncello
samples made following a traditional receipt (apart from the use of
deuterated compounds) is probed and compared to a model system comprising
pure citrus essential oils. Isotopic labeling is a prerequisite for
several techniques used in colloidal science, such as neutron scattering
or nuclear magnetic resonance, and the effect of deuteration on the
physicochemical properties of emulsion systems was investigated before.31,32 While phase boundaries are slightly affected by the isotopic labeling,
negligible effects on the emulsion morphology, that is, average size
and size distribution, have been reported.31,32

Results
Before the small-angle scattering data can be analyzed
and interpreted,
the composition of the ethanolic extract has to be accessed. The essential
oil extracted from citrus flavedo has a complex composition, and more
than 60 volatile compounds have been identified.4 The main components of the essential oil are monoterpenes,
oxygenated compounds such as aldehydes, and sesquiterpenes.1,3,4,33 Monoterpenes
constitute 90% wt of the mixtures and are the main components of the
citrus essential oil, with the most representative compounds being
limonene, β-pinene, and γ-terpinene. Oxygenated compounds,
such as decanal, geranial and neral—two isomers of citral—make
up to 10% of the mixture. Sesquiterpenes, such as β-bisabolene,
constitute ca. 1% of the essential oil mixture.

The amount of
essential oil in the ethanolic extract was evaluated
by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, 1H NMR (see the spectrum
in Figure 1). A quantitative
analysis was performed using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal
standard. Different intense peaks are observed: one at 0 ppm of the
internal reference TMS; two broad peaks centered at 4.6 and 5.3 ppm,
which are ascribed to the water proton and to the hydroxyl proton
of ethanol, respectively;34,35 two singlets at 1.1
and 3.6 ppm, ascribed to residual light hydrogen of the ethanol (see
the 1H NMR spectrum of deuterated ethanol in the Supporting Information); finally, a large number
of peaks between 3.0 and 4.0 ppm and between 0.5 and 2.5 ppm, ascribed
to the main components of the essential oil, are found.36,37 Accordingly, the amount of “essential-oil-protons”
can be estimated by the integral over these two regions, and the oil
content in the ethanolic extract estimated assuming a generic chemical
formula of CxH1.6x, typical of terpenes. With this assumption, an oil content
in the extract of ca. 0.28% wt is estimated. Moreover, from the integrals
of the two broad peaks at 4.6 and 5.3 ppm, the water content in the
extract is estimated at 15% wt, in good agreement with the weight
loss of the lemon peel after infusion in alcohol and with literature
data.38 It has to be remarked that the 1H NMR spectrum provides only an estimate of the amount of
solubilized oil in the complex mixture, for example, the alkene hydrogens
are buried under the large signal from hydroxylic groups.

small aliquot of TMS was added.

Once the chemical composition of the ethanolic extract was
identified,
the mesoscopic structure of mixtures formed by the lemon essential
oil, water, ethanol, and sucrose was studied by SANS. Samples along
the dilution line of the ethanolic extract with the water/syrup were
prepared (LM1 to LM5); the effect of the sucrose content in the liquor
was also probed by preparing samples with constant ethanol/oil content
and with variable water and sucrose amounts (LM5 to LM9). The location
of the investigated samples within the pseudo-ternary phase diagram
is shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, the effect of temperature within the range of 266
K (−7 °C) to 298 K (25 °C) was studied, to evaluate
potential structural changes during consumption: from the chilled
glass to our warm mouth. The ternary phase diagram water/ethanol/lemon
essential oil is presented in Figure 2 and the phase diagram syrup/ethanol/lemon essential
oil is provided in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. Both phase diagrams are almost identical and in
very close agreement with the phase diagram obtained with the pure
limonene.39 The very large two-phase domain
is due to the poor solubility of limonene in water (0.01 g/L). The
samples are prepared in the water-rich part of the phase diagram and
contained less than 0.3% in mass of lemon oil.

Figure 2 On the top, the ternary
diagram reporting the composition of the
samples used for the SANS analysis is given. The axes report the relative
concentration of water, sucrose, and ethanol/essential oil mixture
(∼ 0.3 %wt essential oil in d6-ethanol).
The number within the red square indicates the sample name and the
position of the square its composition. Samples 1 to 5 were prepared
by dilution of the ethanolic extract with the sucrose syrup; for samples
5 to 9 the amount of sucrose is systematically varied. See experimental
section for further details. On the bottom, the phase diagram recorded
for mixtures of water, ethanol, and a commercial citrus lemon essential
oil extract is given; triangles represent the transition from the
homogeneous to the pre-Ouzo region, circles represent the transition
to the Ouzo-region, and squares delimit the region where rapid phase
separation occurs. Concentrations are given in weight fraction. Lines
are only a guide to the eyes. For the sake of comparison, the samples
used for the SANS analysis, are also illustrated as dark squares.
These points are compressed onto the left border due to the overall
very low content of essential oil in the extract. Pictures of samples
prepared in the four regions of the phase diagrams were taken under
laser irradiation (633 nm, <1 mW) to highlight the turbidity of
the sample.

A representative set
of SANS curves is given in Figure 3, where the scattering intensity I(q) is plotted as a function of the scattering
vector q. All other recorded patterns are given in
the Supporting Information. The ethanolic
extract (sample LM1), located in the ethanol-rich corner of the phase
diagram, is homogeneous at a molecular scale, as proven by the very
weak scattering intensity. As expected, the scattering intensity increases
over 4 orders of magnitude upon addition of water, as evidenced in
the left-hand-side plot of Figure 3. All curves look qualitatively very similar, with
the main feature being an extended q–4 power-law, typical for two-domain systems with a sharp interface.
Typical examples are emulsions, marble, alloys presenting precipitate
formation, or foams.29,40−42 The observed
scattering arises from the variation of the atomic composition at
the interface between the domains and the suspending medium. Performing
a Porod analysis allows us to determine the specific amount of interface
Σ present in the system43 1  where Δρ is the scattering length
difference between the domains and the medium. In the approximation
that the oil droplets are spherical, the specific interface is related
to the Porod radius RP 2  with ϕ being the volume fraction of
the droplets. For the calculation of Δρ and ϕ, we
assumed that the essential oil droplets are suspended in a water/ethanol/sucrose
mixture (see the Supporting Information for details). The scattering curves, however, present more features
than a simple q–4 power law. In
fact, an oscillation is visible in the low-q part
of the I(q)q4 representation (right-hand-side plot of Figure 3). This oscillation arises
from the finite size of the essential oil droplets. Accordingly, the
whole scattering pattern was described with a polydisperse sphere
model, given by the following expression 3  with 1N being
the number of droplets per unit of volume and P df(r) the probability density function describing
the relative abundance of a droplet of radius r and
volume V(r) = 4/3πr3. Herein, a lognormal distribution was chosen
to describe the polydisperse sizes of the emulsion droplets.18 The probability density function, defined by
two parameters, μ and σ, is given by 4  

Figure 3 SANS
patterns arising from ternary systems prepared by the dilution
of the ethanolic extract with a water/sucrose syrup recorded at 298
K. On the top, the coherent scattering intensity is given as a function
of the scattering vector. On the bottom, the scattering intensity
multiplied with the fourth power of the scattering vector is given.
The constant trend represents the Porod region, and the dotted lines
indicate the Porod constant. The exact sample composition is given
in Table 1 and their
location in the pseudo-ternary diagram in Figure 2.

The main advantage of the use of a lognormal distribution
for the
description of SANS data from polydisperse systems is that negative
values for the droplet radius are not allowed and that the function
can be used without any need of introducing cut-offs.

In summary,
there are two procedures to obtain the size of the
lemon essential oil droplets in the Limoncello mixtures: in the former
one, the size is deduced from the scattering at the oil/medium interface,
assuming the oil is completely separated from the solution; in the
latter one, the patterns are analyzed with a model of polydisperse
spheres, whereby the parameters μ and σ describing the
size distribution and the droplet volume fraction ϕ are optimized.
In the right-hand-side plot of Figure 3, the Porod constant is indicated with the dashed line,
while the polydisperse sphere model is indicated by a full line. Further
details, calculated curves, and the obtained parameters are given
in the Supporting Information. The Porod
radius, calculated with eq 2, can be directly compared to the ratio of the third and second
moment of the size distribution obtained from the full SANS analysis,
given by 5  

The calculated radii are given in Figure 4 as a function of the water content, for
all samples recorded at the different temperatures. The temperature-dependence
of the volume fraction of the components and of the scattering contrast
was taken into account (see the Supporting Information for full details). The results from the Porod analysis indicate
that the total amount of interface in the systems increases with increasing
water content, which results, within the assumption of full microphase-separation
of the essential oil from the medium, in a decreasing radius of the
droplets. In contrast, the full analysis of the scattering patterns
indicates that the size of the droplets is rather constant of ca.
100 nm for all investigated samples, and that the volume fraction
of the oil droplets increases with increasing water content (see Figure S14). Both analyses deliver the same,
consistent results for the samples with the highest water content
(>55% wt).

Figure 4 Average droplet size found in the different Limoncello
samples
by the analysis of the SANS patterns. Empty symbols represent sizes
obtained via the Porod analysis (eqs 1 and 2) under the assumption
that the essential oil completely separates into domains dispersed
in the water/alcohol/sucrose mixture. Full symbols result from modeling
the SANS curves with a polydisperse sphere model (eq 3), whereby the amount of separated
oil was not fixed in the model. Full lines are only a guide for the
eye. If a full microphase separation between the oil and the remaining
components would take place, the two analyses would lead to the same
results.

The discrepancy between the droplet
sizes obtained from the Porod
analysis and those obtained from the fit with a polydisperse sphere
model indicates that, at low water content, a significant amount of
essential oil is molecularly dissolved in the solution and is not
participating in the formation of the emulsified droplets. A wrong
assumption on the volume fraction of oil droplets leads therefore
to an overestimation of the Porod radius via eq 2. In fact, the sample LM1, with a water content
as low as 15% wt, is a homogeneous solution, where all components
are molecularly dissolved. Furthermore, the volume fraction of the
oil droplets obtained from the polydisperse sphere model increases
from less than 0.01% vol for the LM2 sample to ca. 0.15% vol (see Figure S16). The latter coincides with the predictions
made from the 1H NMR results for the samples with the highest
water content (LM8 and LM9).

It is worth mentioning that the
analysis of the SANS data with
the model of polydisperse sphere suffers from the lack of a clear
plateau at low-q values, which would clearly define
the size of and the volume fraction of the spontaneously emulsified
oil droplets. However, the latter can be evaluated in an independent
fashion from the Porod integral44,45 6  

The obtained volume fractions of oil
droplets are fully consistent
with the values obtained from the fit of the data with the polydisperse
sphere model (see Figure S17 in the Supporting Information). This consistency further corroborates the validity
of the results from the polydisperse sphere model analysis.

The study also reveals that temperature does not affect the microstructure
of the Limoncello in the studied temperature range (−7 to 25
°C), except that the solubility of the essential oil in the mixed
solvent increases with increasing temperature, in agreement with previous
studies on (+)limonene/water/ethanol mixtures.46 Surprisingly, the presence of large amounts of sucrose,
up to 25% wt, does not alter the microstructure of the Limoncello
samples. This observation is further confirmed by the fact that the
presence of sucrose minimally affects the phase behavior of the mixtures
of essential oil/ethanol/water, as shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S6.

The size of the
self-emulsified oil domains is relatively small
when compared to other ternary oil/water/ethanol mixtures, where typical
sizes of larger than 500 nm are found.25,29 The small
size can be explained by the presence of surface active molecules,
for example, lipids or proteins, extracted during the maceration of
the lemon zest. It is likely that these components stabilize the oil/water
interface leading to smaller oil droplets.30,47 To verify this hypothesis, additional SANS experiments were performed
on pseudo-Limoncello samples prepared by mixing water, sucrose, ethanol,
and lemon essential oil, thus avoiding the direct contact of ethanol
and the lemon zests during the maceration process. SANS patterns are
shown in Figure 5.
The data were recorded on an extended q-range, thus
covering also the Guinier region at low-q. They were
analyzed with the same models described earlier in the text, the droplet
radii are given in Figure 4 and show excellent agreement with the results from the “real”
Limoncello samples. The finding rules out that the exceptionally small
sizes found in these mixtures are caused by the presence of non-oily,
surface-active components, such as lipids and proteins. In addition,
the good agreement corroborates the correctness of the estimate of
the essential oil content in the ethanolic extract used to prepare
the “real” Limoncello samples and that the missing Guinier
plateau does not lead to a misinterpretation of the scattering data.

arising from ternary systems prepared from mixing
cold-pressed essential lemon oil, ethanol, water, and sucrose and
recorded at 298 K. The exact composition is given in Table 1.

Finally, the interfacial tension between lemon essential
oil and
water/sucrose/ethanol was determined by pending drop experiments.
A low, but not extraordinary low, value of the interfacial tension
of 4–5 mN/m (see the last paragraph of the Supporting Information) was found. Similar values were found
between the oil-rich and oil-poor phase in water/ethanol/1-octanol
mixtures.13

Discussion
The
microstructure of the Limoncello samples prepared in this work
is surprisingly stable. Except for the ethanolic extract, in all samples
the presence of polydisperse essential oil droplets with an average
size of ca. 100 nm is demonstrated. Neither the presence of sucrose
nor changes in temperature have an effect on the microstructure of
the investigated Limoncello samples. The size of the oil-domains of
ca. 100 nm is surprisingly small when compared to the typical size
of ouzo-systems which ranges from 500 nm to several micrometers.25,29 The small size of the Limoncello droplets does not arise from the
presence of surface-active contaminants, for example, lipids or proteins
extracted during the maceration of the lemon zest. It is more likely
that the complex mixture of the essential oil is able to stabilize
droplets, whose size is intermediate between classical microemulsions
(2–20 nm) and metastable ouzo-systems or classical oil/water
emulsions (>500 nm).

While the size of the domains remains
basically constant with temperature
and composition, a continuous evolution in the amount of essential
oil which participates in the droplet formation is observed. Sample
LM1, with a water content of 15% wt (ethanol content of ca. 85% wt),
is fully homogeneous, and no concentration fluctuations were observed.
On the contrary, a complete microphase separation of the essential
oils from the continuous phase is obtained for a water content larger
than 60% wt. Interestingly, high-quality Limoncello samples have usually
a composition close to the LM5 sample, with a water content of ca.
50% wt. At this composition, 1/3 of the essential oil is molecularly
dispersed in the continuous phase (Figure S16). The microstructure of Limoncello is fundamental for the different
properties of the liquor: the droplet size will affect the optical
appearance and time-stability of the drink. Moreover, droplet size
and distribution of the active fragrance within the mixture is expected
to have a pronounced effect on the vapor pressure of the active perfume
molecules, and therefore on the smell of the liquor. In a recent work,
Zemb et al. have shown that the vapor pressure of a model fragrance,
styrallyl acetate, dissolved in a water/ethanol mixture, reaches a
maximum close to the boundary between the meta-stable ouzo region
and the biphasic domain.17 A lower activity
of the fragrance is observed in the homogeneous region, where it is
well-dissolved as well as in the biphasic domain, where the active
components are trapped in micrometer sized droplets. Further studies
evidenced that the solubilization of the fragrance in micellar aggregates
reduces their evaporation rate,48 in agreement
with the finding that the evaporation of the active component from
a surfactant stabilized air/water interface is limited by its diffusion
through a depleted region close to the surface.49 According to these findings, it seems that Limoncello samples
with a composition close to LM5 present all the needed properties
for a good digestive: the rather large fraction of free essential
oils ensures a strong smell and taste of the liquor, which made it
so popular. The typical droplet size of approx. 100 nm gives rise
to the typical opalescent appearance but ensures both long-time stability
and a rapid exchange between molecularly dissolved essential oil and
small droplets. Noteworthy, a home-made Limoncello, prepared with
hydrogenated water and ethanol close to the composition of LM5 and
the same lemons of the experiment reported herein, had an excellent
taste.

Conclusions
In this work, a structural analysis of
real Limoncello samples
was performed using SANS, shedding light for the first time on the
mesoscopic structure of this very famous Italian liquor. The results
show that the system is composed of polydisperse oil droplets dispersed
in a continuous water/ethanol/sucrose medium. These droplets, whose
size of ca. 100 nm shows little variation with temperature and overall
composition, are in equilibrium with molecularly dissolved essential
oil. Interestingly, at a system composition close to that of commercial
Limoncellos, ca. 1/3 of the essential oil is molecularly dissolved
and in equilibrium with the sub-micrometer large droplets. It is expected
that the overall sensory experience of Limoncello: its smell, taste,
and optical appearance, results from this delicate equilibrium.

However, the relevance of the study goes beyond the use of neutron
scattering for the characterization of a tasty digestive. Essential
oils, especially limonene, are experiencing quickly growing applications.
In addition to the traditional use as flavors and fragrances, the
oils extracted from citrus fruits are becoming increasingly relevant,
for example, as green solvents in replacement of petro-based chemicals
for specific applications,50−54 as speciality chemicals,55−58 or as bio-based monomer or monomer precursors for
polymerization reactions.37,59,60 An increased use of essential oils has several implications, from
an environmental and socio-economic perspective. The increasing demand
for citrus essential oils induces the development of new industrial
activities aiming at the treatment of citrus waste products thus reducing
the environmental impact of direct landfilling of the citrus waste50 and providing economic growth opportunities
in the citrus-producing regions, such as Latin America, Southeast
Asia, and Southern Europe. In particular, the potential of pseudo-ternary
systems made of water/alcohol/essential oils is being currently explored,
and recent developments are reported, for example, as mosquito-repellent
formulations61,62 or as a medium for enzymatic
and chemical reactions.20,22,63 To understand these systems, with the aim of tailoring them to the
desired need, a detailed knowledge of the microscopic structure is
mandatory, and, SANS provides a unique tool, as shown in this work
for the case of Limoncello.

To conclude, the work reports the
spontaneous formation of 100
nm-sized essential oil droplets in a continuous polar phase, which
are stable over a long time range. These findings open two fundamental
questions to be addresses in forthcoming studies: what are the physical
forces leading to the formation of oil domains with such an exceptional
size and what is the mechanism guaranteeing a long term stability
to Limoncello systems.

Materials and Methods
Materials and Sample Preparation
The samples were prepared
using deuterated water (D content >99.8%) from
Eurisotop
(Gif-sur-Yvette, France), d6-ethanol (99%
purity) from Deutero (Kastellaun, Germany), commercial sucrose, and
nontreated lemons from Sicily bought at a local market. The ethanolic
extract was prepared by immersing 2.5 g of the outer part of lemon
skins, the flavedo, in 12.6 g of pure fully deuterated ethanol. The
lemon peels were kept macerating in the absolute deuterated alcohol
for 4 weeks. After this period, a sucrose syrup was prepared by dissolving
6.6 g of sucrose in 13.2 g of D2O. Samples were prepared
by addition of the syrup and/or D2O to the ethanolic extract.
Gentle shaking is sufficient for homogenization. The final composition
of the samples is given in Table 1. The composition of the ethanolic
extract was determined via 1H NMR as described before.
Further samples were prepared using cold-pressed lemon essential oil
from Arkpharma (Carros, France).

oil. The conversion from weight fractions to volume fractions was
performed using the density values given in Table 2.

Phase
Diagram Determination
The phase diagrams were
visually determined. Binary mixtures of cold-pressed lemon essential
oil and ethanol at different ratios were prepared by weighing the
proper amounts of chemicals in 5 mL glass tubes. Small amounts of
water, or of a 33% wt sucrose solution, were added gradually. The
binary essential oil/ethanol mixtures are perfectly transparent. The
transition to the pre-ouzo region is identified as the first signs
of opalescence are detected. Further addition of water, or of a 33%
wt sucrose solution, causes the system to turn highly turbid. The
transition from translucent to turbid delimits the metastable ouzo-region.
In the oil-rich part, further addition of water induces a sudden phase
separation of the sample corresponding to the binodal line. The 2-phase
domain is more difficult to observe in the oil-poor domain, where
the phase separation only appears after several hours at rest.

on D11 at the Institut Laue–Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble, France.64,65 Raw and reduced data are available at doi:10.5291/ILL–DATA.INTER–372.
Three different configurations were used, with a wavelength of λ
= 6.0 Å, sample-to-detector distances (SD) of 1.2, 8, and 34
m and collimation of 4, 8, and 34 m, respectively, covering a q-range of 0.015–5 nm–1, where q = 4π sin(θ/2)/λ is the magnitude of
the scattering vector and θ is the scattering angle. An additional
configuration was used for the samples prepared with cold-pressed
lemon essential oil, with a sample-to-detector distance of 39 m, collimation
of 40 m, wavelength λ = 12 Å, and removing the beam-stop,
reaching a minimum q value of 0.004 nm–1. The differential cross sections in absolute scale were obtained
by comparison with the scattering from a 1 mm water sample. The analysis
was performed using the values of densities and scattering length
densities ρ of the compounds reported in Table 2.

1H NMR
1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a 700 MHz Bruker AVANCE III HD spectrometer. Experiments were carried
out at 25 °C.

Interfacial Tension
The interfacial
tension between
the citrus essential oil and the water/sucrose/ethanol solution was
measured at room temperature using a drop shape analyzer DSA10 from
Krüss. Drops of oil in heavy water were created using an inverted
blunt needle of 0.72 mm in diameter immersed in a 10 mm (thickness)
× 20 mm (width) × 40 mm (height) optical glass cuvette.
The interfacial tension was calculated from the drop profile by the
Krüss software using the Young–Laplace equation.
