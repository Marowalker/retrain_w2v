The pyrophosphate anion (PPi) plays
an important role in biochemical
processes. Therefore, a simple but reliable analytical technique is
essential for selective detection of PPi in biochemical systems. Here,
we present a principal component analysis (PCA) method for analytical
determination of PPi concentration using a fluorescent conjugated
polyelectrolyte (CPE) combined with a polyamine modifier. The CPE
has anionic side chains and dissolves molecularly in water, as indicated
by its structured fluorescence emission spectrum. However, addition
of tris(3-aminoethyl)amine (tetraamine or N4) quenches
the CPE fluorescence emission. Tetraamine, which is a polycation at
neutral pH, binds multiple anionic CPE chains, leading to aggregate
formation, resulting in aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching.
Addition of PPi to the polymer–amine aggregate reverses the
process, resulting in fluorescence recovery. The relatively higher
concentration of PPi compared to that of the polymer allows it to
effectively compete to bind the amine, thus releasing molecularly
dissolved polymer chains. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy of
the P1/N4 complex and of P1/N4/PPi confirms the change in size of the CPE aggregates
that occurs upon reversible aggregation. Application of PCA to the
fluorescence emission data set of standard samples yields two principal
components, which are used to create a predictive model for PPi analysis.
The PCA method is able to directly determine the concentration of
PPi with approximately 95% accuracy within the concentration range
from 100 μM to 3 mM, without the need for a reference state
as is typically needed for ratiometric fluorescence assays.

Introduction
Pyrophosphate (P2O74–;
PPi) is a biologically significant anion that plays an essential role
in bioenergetics and metabolic processes, including energy transduction,
extracellular signal mediations, and protein synthesis.1−4 In particular, PPi is known to be involved in DNA and RNA polymerization,5 hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate,6 cyclic adenosine monophosphate synthesis, and
many other enzymatic reactions.7,8 It has also been reported
that abnormal levels of PPi are related to various diseases, including
cancer,9−11 arthritis,12 and vascular
calcification.13 Therefore, selective detection
and sensing of PPi is important to understand its role in these biological
processes. The use of colorimetric or fluorescence chemosensors is
the most common approach to PPi detection.14−19 Water-soluble fluorescent sensors are particularly gaining much
research attention due to their superior sensitivity and selectivity,
low cost, and convenient detection.20−24

Fluorescence sensors for PPi based on small-molecule
fluorophores
have been developed in the past.25−27 These small chromophores
contain metal cations, such as zinc,28 copper,29 cadmium,11 and palladium,25 which serve as the PPi receptors. PPi has a
high binding affinity toward metal ions; thus, it can coordinate with
the metal ions of the chromophores to form a host–guest complex,
resulting in fluorometric (and/or colorimetric) signal changes. However,
these techniques suffer from low PPi/Pi selectivity, require considerable
synthetic effort, use heavy metal ions, and have limited applications
in device fabrication.30−32 Therefore, there remains room for additional PPi
sensor development to address some of these limitations.

Principal
component analysis (PCA) is a standard statistical tool
for data analysis that generally applies to multivariate analytical
systems.33−37 First established in 1901 by Karl Pearson, it has become one of
the most-often used tools in exploratory data analysis and predictive
modeling.38 PCA provides a simple and robust
method to reduce data dimensionality and reveals useful information
behind complex data sets with minimal computational effort.39,40 Therefore, this method has been
applied in a variety of sensor systems.41−44 The PCA method has also been
applied to extract meaningful information from spectroscopic data
sets45−50 that are complicated by overlapping of different spectral components,
background interference, and uncalibrated spectral features.

The strong absorption and amplified quenching behavior of conjugated
polyelectrolytes (CPEs) make them suitable candidates for sensing
and imaging of biomolecules.51−53 The anionic carboxylate-substituted
anionic CPE P1 (Scheme 1) is completely soluble in water and exhibits remarkable
photophysical properties.54 We recently
investigated the aggregation response of P1 toward different
polyamines.55 In particular, we observed
significant fluorescence quenching of P1 upon addition
of tris(3-aminoethyl)amine (N4; Scheme 1) due to interchain aggregation of P1 induced by interaction with the polyamines.55 Furthermore, we found that the N4-quenched fluorescence of P1 can be recovered selectively
by addition of PPi. This article reports a sensitive and selective
sensor for PPi based on “turn-on” fluorescence from
the aggregated P1/N4 complex. Fluorescence
recovery is achieved by disrupting the P1/N4 complex, as PPi competes to bind N4, which releases
molecularly dissolved polymer chains from the P1/N4 aggregates. The PCA method was used to analyze the fluorescence
spectroscopic data and to develop a calibration that can be applied
to quantitatively determine the concentration of PPi from a single
spectroscopic measurement, without the need for a reference sample
or absolute intensity calibration. The results demonstrate that the
PCA calibration method provides a convenient and reliable method for
direct determination of the PPi concentration without the need for
a reference, allowing the measurement of the PPi concentration with
good accuracy and precision over the concentration range from 100
μM to 3 mM. The method can be useful for sensing PPi in biological
samples, as the PPi concentration in human samples ranges from submicromolar
concentrations to >25 μM, depending upon the source and condition.56

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of P1, N4, and PPi
Experimental Section
Materials
The synthesis of P1 is reported
in the literature.54 All samples were prepared
in water that was distilled and then purified by a Millipore purification
system (Millipore Simplicity Ultrapure Water System). Buffer solution
(N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), 10 mM, pH = 7.4) was prepared using 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine
ethanesulfonic acid and sodium hydroxide from Sigma-Aldrich. Tris(3-aminoethyl)amine
and potassium pyrophosphate were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
All chemicals were used as received, unless otherwise noted.

Instrumentation57,58
Fluorescence spectra
were recorded using a spectrofluorometer from Photon Technology International
(Quanta Master). All of the spectra were corrected using correction
factors generated with a primary standard lamp. Fluorescence correlation
spectroscopy (FCS) data were obtained on a homemade setup using a
405 nm diode laser (CUBE; Coherent) as the excitation source. Fluorescein
(30 nM) in phosphate buffer (10 mM, pH = 8) was used as the calibration
standard for the FCS system.

Basic Methods for PCA
This section
follows the literature
procedure, with some modifications.47 To
perform PCA, we first establish a data matrix, D0, from the raw fluorescence data 1  where Xi,j is the jth factor associated with row i. In our
study, we refer to Xi,j as the fluorescence intensity at wavelength i in
the jth group from the raw data set.
To avoid any inconsistency during experiment operation, each fluorescence
spectrum area is normalized using eq 2, where A is the integration area
for the fluorescence spectrum of P1 (2 μM) in HEPES
buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) and 109 is an arbitrary number for
the normalization. 2  To make this
data matrix factor-analyzable,47 it can
be written as a linear sum of product
terms in the form 3  Here, R and C are
defined as scores and loading matrices, which can be used to reproduce
the original experimental data matrix, D. To define the R and C matrices, the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the covariance matrix, Z, were calculated, which is
inherently a square matrix 4  Then, there is matrix Q, which
can diagonalize Z 5  The eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues
for the matrix can be easily calculated on the basis of eq 6, where qj is the jth column of Q. 6  Therefore, matrix Q can
be easily
constructed from the eigenvectors. As these eigenvectors are mutually
orthonormal, we can find that 7  By exploiting eq 7, eqs 8 and 9 are obtained.
Then, the R and C matrices are subsequently
calculated on the basis
of the relationships 8   9  To minimize the
residual error, the eigenvectors
are consecutively calculated in the present procedure. As a result,
each successive eigenvector corresponds to the biggest variation in
the data. After all of the eigenvalues are calculated using eq 5, the largest eigenvalue
and corresponding eigenvector are selected.
Then, a residual matrix is defined by subtracting the variation corresponding
to the largest eigenvalue, λ1, and eigenvector, q1, from the covariance matrix, as in eq 10. 10  From this residual matrix, the second principal
eigenvector and its associated eigenvalue are calculated. 11  To
obtain the third eigenvector, RE2 is defined
as 12  The calculations were continued in this manner
until the eigenvalue was less than 0.001 of the largest eigenvalue,
λ1.

Target Transformation
As previously
mentioned, the R and C matrices do not have
any physical or
chemical meaning, as they constitute an abstract solution. Therefore,
a target transformation is necessary to change them into meaningful
factors. This is achieved by applying a transformation matrix and
then relating it to eq 3 13  In eq 13, transformation matrix T is a square matrix
of dimension n, where n is the number
of significant factors determined by PCA. Now, data matrix T can be described with two principal factors 14  If the transformation is orthogonal (i.e.,
it preserves the angles between the factor axes), then a, b, c, and d are
unity. However, if the transformation is nonorthogonal, then these
constants should be determined by taking into account the prior information
about the real factors.47

Results
and Discussion
Overview of PPi Turn-On Sensor
An
aggregated complex
of anionic CPE containing carboxylate functional group side chains
(P1) and tris(3-aminoethyl)amine (N4) was
used for PPi sensing in this study (Scheme 1). The PPi turn-on mechanism for aggregated P1 based on the “quench–unquench” process
is illustrated in Scheme 2. Initially, the polymer aqueous solution exhibits a structured
fluorescence emission (Φ = 0.42),54 with a maximum peak at λ ∼ 434 nm, indicating the presence
of molecularly dissolved polymer chains (no aggregation) in solution.
Addition of tris(3-aminoethyl)amine (N4) to the polymer
solution quenches the fluorescence of P1 by inducing
interchain aggregation. The color of the fluorescence visibly changes
from blue to green, and the emission band redshifts as a result of
aggregation.59 Interestingly, the quenched
fluorescence is recovered by addition of PPi to the P1/N4 solution. Thus, the concentration of PPi is related
to the fraction of molecularly dissolved polymer chains in the solution,
which is in turn detected by a blueshift and enhancement in the fluorescence
emission. This fluorescence “on–off–on”
process affords a convenient way to determine the presence and concentration
of PPi.

Scheme 2 Mechanism of the PPi Turn-On Sensor
Fluorescence Quenching of P1 by N4
As discussed above, P1 is molecularly dissolved
in water, presumably due to the relatively high negative charge density
on the chains. However, when N4 is added to the polymer
solution in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH = 7.4), an ion-pair interaction
between the cationic polyamine and conjugated polyanion induces aggregation.
Because N4 has three primary amino units, a single polyamine
cation binds more than one polymer chain, serving as a linker between
chains, inducing aggregation.

Polymer aggregation was studied
by titrating a P1 solution (2 μM) in HEPES buffer
with N4 (0–10 μM). The fluorescence emissions
of the resulting P1/N4 mixtures are shown
in Figures 1a. The
strong fluorescence peak at λ ∼ 424 nm gradually decreases
upon addition of N4, and a new broad band appears at
λ ∼ 540 nm. This new peak is attributed to the aggregated
CPE. The Stern–Volmer constant (Ksv) for the quenching process was calculated to be ∼8.5 ×
104 M–1.

Figure 1 Fluorescence spectral changes upon titration.
(a) Fluorescence
quenching: P1 (2 μM) with an N4 concentration
ranging from 0 to 10 μM, (b) Fluorescence recovery: P1/N4 complex with a PPi concentration ranging from 10
μM to 3 mM. Titrations were carried out in HEPES buffer (10
mM, pH 7.4).

Fluorescence Recovery of P1/N4 by
PPi
It has been shown that PPi forms a complex with polyamines
or related structures very effectively.60,61 To investigate
the interaction between PPi and the P1/N4 complex, the P1/N4 solution (2 μM
of P1 and 4 μM of N4) in HEPES buffer
was titrated against PPi for concentrations ranging from 10 μM
to 3 mM. Fluorescence spectral changes of the solution during PPi
titration are presented in Figure 1b. In the P1/N4 complex,
the fluorescence intensity of P1 at 424 nm is almost
90% quenched (red line) relative to the initial fluorescence of pure P1 (black line). Addition of PPi to the P1/N4 complex increases the fluorescence peak intensity at 424
nm, whereas it decrease the band due to the aggregate at 540 nm. The
fluorescence at 424 nm is recovered to ∼90% of the initial
intensity for the pure polymer upon adding 3 mM PPi. Meanwhile, ∼70%
of the fluorescence at 540 nm is decreased in comparison to that in
the P1/N4 mixture. The recovered fluorescence
intensity is a result of decreased polymer aggregation. The effect
of Pi on the fluorescence recovery of the P1/N4 complex was also investigated by titrating the P1/N4 solution with Pi (10 μM to 3 mM). Contrary to the
PPi titration, Pi does not induce any significant fluorescence recovery,
suggesting that this sensor has good selectivity toward PPi over Pi
(Figure S1).

FCS Measurements
To provide evidence for the hypothesis
that the fluorescence turn-off/turn-on process is indeed caused by
a change in the aggregation state of P1 induced by the
addition of N4 and/or PPi, FCS was carried out to investigate
the size change of the polymer. FCS measures the diffusion time, which
depends on the size of the polymer chains or aggregates present in
the solution.62−64 The correlation curves as well as the nonlinear fits
for different systems are shown
in Figure 2, where
[P1] is fixed at 2 μM. For P1, a diffusion
time of ∼6.3 × 10–5 s is observed, which
is comparable to the typical value for a well-dispersed CPE in aqueous
solution.64 The correlation curve for the P1/N4 complex ([N4] = 4 μM)
is shifted significantly, reflecting a greater than 10-fold increase
in the diffusion time (∼65 × 10–5 s).
This significant increase in the diffusion time clearly indicates
that addition of N4 induces aggregation of the polymer.65 As expected, the correlation curve shifted back
to a lower diffusion time (∼6.4 × 10–5 s) after 200 μM PPi was added to the P1/N4 mixture, where it almost coincides with the original correlation
curve for the polymer alone. This observation further supports the
notion that PPi successfully disrupts the polymer aggregation and
releases the molecularly dissolved polymer chains.

systems. Black squares: [P1] = 2 μM; red circles:

curves. Inset: The table shows diffusion time.

PCA Calibration Using a Spectroscopic Data Set
The
titration experiment with PPi was carried out to obtain a calibration
standard, and the spectroscopic data set thus collected was investigated
by the PCA method. During the titration, fluorescence spectra were
obtained at 13 different PPi concentrations. This emission data set
was normalized by adjusting the integrated areas for the pure polymer
emission data to 109 (Figure 3a). The spectroscopic data set was then transformed
into a 316 × 13 data matrix, D316×13, where the 316 rows correspond to emission wavelengths covering
the spectral range from 384 to 700 nm and the 13 columns correspond
to the PPi concentrations.

Figure 3 (a) Normalized emission spectral changes upon
titration of 2 μM P1 and 4 μM N4 with PPi (0–3 mM)
in HEPES buffer solution (10 mM, pH = 7.4). (b) Fundamental spectra
(matrices, R) for the two largest eigenvalues. (c) Reconstructed
spectra, D = R1C1 + R2C2, obtained
by combining the total contributions from the two largest eigenvalues.

The PCA algorithm was applied
to the raw data matrix, D316×13, to calculate
two significant eigenvectors
of covariance matrix Z (of a total of 13), which account
for 99.99% of the variation for the matrix, D316×13. As previously discussed, the initial eigenvectors generated by
PCA do not have any physical meaning; for example, one of the eigenvectors
features a negative amplitude (Figure S2). Hence, an appropriate target transformation is needed to rotate
the initial eigenvectors into physically meaningful factors. Two guidelines
were followed in determining the rotation:47 (1) a negative emission intensity was not allowed and (2) both eigenvectors
were considered to be related to the emission spectra that are attributed
to one of the fluorescent states of the polymer. Consequently, a new
transformation matrix was produced and is shown in eq 15, in which the coefficients and
rotation angles were determined semiempirically. 15  After multiplication of the initial R matrix by transformation
matrix T, two new
eigenvectors (R1 and R2) were obtained. In Figure 3b, R1 (red line) represents the fundamental
spectrum for the first eigenvector, whereas R2 (blue line) represents the fundamental spectrum for the second eigenvector.
As shown in Figure 3b, R1 appears as a strong structured emission
spectrum, with a maximum at λ ∼ 430 nm, very similar
to the fluorescence emission of P1 in its molecularly
dissolved (single-chain) state. The result suggests that the first
eigenvector is mostly single-polymer-dependent, representing the emission
of the molecularly dissolved polymer. By contrast, eigenvector R2 appears as a broad emission band at a longer
wavelength, λ ∼ 540 nm, which is dominated by the aggregate
state of the polymer. Note that there are also two other small bands
at λ ∼ 430 and 450 nm, which indicate slight contributions
to the eigenvector from the single-chain state of the polymer. Even
though the separation is not perfect for R2, it accounts for the contribution mostly from the aggregated polymer
to the total emission spectrum. Hence, the PCA method successfully
resolves most of the emission variations from the polymer single-chain
and aggregate states by providing two principal eigenvectors.

Loading
Data for Each Eigenvector at Different [PPi]
The loading
for each eigenvector at different [PPi] (0–3 mM)
was determined on the basis of eq 9, and this allows calculation of the reconstructed
data matrix. Figure S3a,b illustrates the
fractional contributions of both eigenvectors to the total reconstructed
emission spectra at varying [PPi]. Using the loading factors and eigenvectors,
it is possible to generate the set of reconstructed fluorescence emission
spectra for the data series, as shown in Figure 3c; note that the reconstructed spectra are
virtually identical to the original emission spectra (Figure 3a). The results clearly show
that PCA analysis successfully reduces a large set of data into two
principal components that describe most of the spectroscopic changes
at different [PPi] without loss of much detail.

The plot in Figure 4 shows the loadings
for both eigenvectors at varying [PPi]. With an increasing PPi concentration,
the effect of the first eigenvector (red line) increases, whereas
that of the second eigenvector (black line) decreases. The blue line,
which appears to be nearly horizontal, represents the total loadings
of the two principal components. As mentioned earlier, the first eigenvector
represents mainly free polymer chain emission, and the second one
is primarily related to aggregated state fluorescence emission; therefore,
the blue line should be horizontal (i.e., a constant value) if we
assume that the polymer only exists in the molecularly dissolved or
aggregate state. As the total emission spectrum is a combination of
the fluorescence spectra of the molecularly dissolved polymer and
the aggregate, the total effect of both eigenvectors under the same
experimental conditions should be constant as long as the concentrations
of the polymer and amine are fixed.

as a function of different
[PPi].

Regression Analysis
One of the main objectives of this
study was to predict the PPi concentration in an unknown sample using
the PCA calibration method. To apply the data from standard experiments
to other unknown systems, a nonlinear regression analysis was carried
out to relate the PPi analyte concentration to the loading values.
This analysis determined the values of the coefficients for a model
function that best fits the set of data from a standard “calibration”
experiment.66,67 Specifically, the C1 and C2 values obtained from
PCA were fitted to the PPi concentrations using an empirically selected
biexponential function (see Supporting Information). This function was selected to provide the best possible fit of
the experimental data to the combination of coefficients. Table S1 shows the coefficients for the variables
in the nonlinear regression equation. Note that, earlier, we have
explained that the sum of the C1 and C2 fractions is approximately constant because
the total of C1 and C2 is a constant when the experimental conditions are fixed (see Figure 4). Therefore, in
the regression analysis we used C1 and 1 – C1(which
is ∼C2) rather than directly using C1 and C2. By reducing
the number of variables from two to one, the complexity of the system
is reduced.

Figure 5 provides the calibration plot from the standard data, which
relates the PPi concentration to the fraction of C1 (and C2) needed to fit the experimental
spectra using the combined eigenvalues. In this calibration, the coefficients
were normalized to the condition C1 + C2 = 1. This plot can be considered to be a calibration
that allows determination of the PPi concentration in an unknown sample
pending fitting of the observed emission spectrum with a linear combination
of the two eigenvectors. In this graph, the black points represent
standard samples and the red line represents the regression fit function.

(Supporting Information). Black squares
represent calibration data from standard samples. Blue triangles represent
data from unknown samples.

Application to Unknowns
The regression function provides
the fundamentals for prediction of the PPi concentration in unknown
samples. In our system, the two largest eigenvectors obtained from
PCA correspond to the two states of the polymer, and there is only
one variable (PPi concentration) that affects the observed fluorescence
spectrum, as long as the experimental conditions are fixed (e.g.,
concentration of P1 and N4). Most importantly,
variation of [PPi] only affects the equilibrium between the molecularly
dissolved and aggregated polymers. Therefore, it will not change the
eigenvectors as well as their fundamental matrices (R1 and R2) for the sample system
but only the loading fractions (C1 and C2). Thus, the eigenvectors obtained from the standard
sample can be directly applied to the unknown samples under the same
experimental conditions. To calculate the C1 and C2 values for an unknown sample, first
the fluorescence data matrix for the unknown sample was obtained after
normalization, which was to avoid any inconsistency during experimental
operation. The fundamental matrices (R1, R2) for the first and second eigenvectors from
the standard data matrix were then applied to the fluorescence data
matrix of the unknown samples according to eq 3. Hence, the loading values for unknowns (Cu,1 and Cu,2) for each
eigenvector were determined. In total, 17 unknown PPi samples were
tested, and the loading fractions, Cu,1, were
calculated. Then, [PPi] in the unknown samples was estimated using eq S-1. All of the values from the unknown samples
are shown in Figure 5, represented by blue triangles. The data suggest that the PPi concentration
in unknown samples can be estimated accurately, as most of the data
points are located very close to the calibration plot.

Finally,
the summary in Table 1 shows the predicted average [PPi] for unknown samples as well as
standard errors. The results reveal that the estimated [PPi] remains
close to the actual concentration, as the errors are in the range
of 2–12%. Some of these errors may be associated with sample
preparation, instrumental errors, and operational errors. However,
the results show that the PCA method generally provides good precision
and accuracy when predicting the concentrations of PPi.

Summary
and Conclusions
This work presents the successful design
and development of a CPE-based
fluorescence turn-on sensor that is selective for PPi over other inorganic
anions such as Pi. The sensory system is composed of a CPE (P1) and polyamine (N4) in their aggregated form.
Addition of PPi, which has a strong affinity for N4,
disrupts the P1/N4 complex, releasing molecularly
dissolved polymer chains. The fraction of molecularly dissolved polymer
chains is related to [PPi] in the solution. The molecularly dissolved
polymer (P1) chains are brightly fluorescent can be detected
easily by fluorescence spectroscopy. The FCS study reveals different
diffusion times for P1, P1/N4, and P1/N4/PPi, which confirm the changes
in sizes of the P1 aggregates during titration due to
analyte-induced aggregation/deaggregation.

Two principal components obtained
by PCA analysis of the spectroscopic data were applied to determine
their relationship with [PPi] via regression analysis. The PCA calibration
successfully predicts the concentration of PPi in unknown samples
with good accuracy and precision (<10% error). The detection limit
of this method for PPi concentration ranges from micromolars to several
millimolars (10 μM to ∼3 mM). This method is environment
friendly as it avoids the use of any heavy metal ion. In general,
this method provides a facile and direct method for PPi detection
without the need for a reference sample, as is required for typical
ratiometric fluorescence-based methods. However, the experimental
parameters (including substrate concentration, buffers, temperature,
etc.) for the unknown measurements should be same as those for the
standards for the regression equation. Any change in the experimental
parameters may result in a higher % error.
