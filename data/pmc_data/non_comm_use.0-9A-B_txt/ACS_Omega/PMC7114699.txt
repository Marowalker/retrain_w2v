Four years after
its first report, expansion microscopy (ExM) is
now being routinely applied in laboratories worldwide to achieve super-resolution
imaging on conventional fluorescence microscopes. By chemically anchoring
all molecules of interest to the polymer meshwork of an expandable
hydrogel, their physical distance is increased by a factor of ∼4–5×
upon dialysis in water, resulting in an imprint of the original sample
with a lateral resolution up to 50–70 nm. To ensure a correct
representation of the original spatial distribution of the molecules,
it is crucial to confirm that the expansion is isotropic, preferentially
in all three dimensions. To address this, we present an approach to
evaluate the local expansion factor within a biological sample and
in all three dimensions. We use photobleaching to introduce well-defined
three-dimensional (3D) features in the cell and, by comparing the
size and shape pre- and postexpansion, these features can be used
as an intrinsic ruler. In addition, our method is capable of pointing
out sample distortions and can be used as a quality control tool for
expansion microscopy experiments in biological samples.

Introduction
Fluorescence microscopy
has proven to be a very valuable tool for
accurately unraveling fundamental biological questions by optically
magnifying the image of specifically stained structures of interest.1 However, in biology, the biomolecular actors
of many crucial cellular processes often require imaging with a nanoscale
resolution. As the resolution of a conventional fluorescence microscope
is inherently limited by the physical laws governing the diffraction
of light,2 correctly locating these biomolecular
actors is challenging. To lift this barrier, different microscopy
concepts, known under the term “super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy,” have been developed independently.3−8 Nonetheless, these methods typically require complex microscopy
setups or special fluorescent labels. For this reason, Boyden and
co-workers introduced expansion microscopy (ExM) as an alternative
to classical super-resolution (SR) fluorescence microscopy techniques
for obtaining sub-diffraction resolution on conventional fluorescent
microscopes and with classic fluorescent labels.9 Rather than by increasing the optical resolution, the physical
distance between independent fluorophores is increased by expanding
the sample inside a swellable polymer. To achieve this, structures
of interest such as proteins (Pro-ExM)10 or nucleic acids11 require to be labeled
with an additional chemical cross-linker, besides the classic fluorescent
labeling in order to ensure downstream covalent grafting of their
original location in the hydrogel. Alternatively, recently, multifunctional
linkers have been introduced containing a biomolecular probe, a fluorescent
reporter, and a cross-linkable group, leading to better preserved
fluorescent signals and a broader scope of biological targets.12,13 Finally, by infusing the samples with monomers, a hydrogel can be
formed within the prestained sample. Physical expansion is achieved
upon dialysis in water, with an expansion factor (EF) of 4–10×,
which depends on the type of hydrogel that is being used, resulting
in a resolution of up to 25 nm on conventional microscopes.14

Its ease of implementation and the inherent
clearing of the sample
has led to the rapid adoption of ExM in the field of fluorescence
microscopy.10−19 Not only has this led to the successful imaging of different tissue
slices9,16 in combination with different super-resolution
approaches but ExM also seems suitable for uncovering the structure
of different protein complexes given that the expanded imprint of
the sample perfectly mimics its original conformation.20−22 However, it currently remains a challenge to objectively evaluate
whether this assumption holds in different biological samples. That
is to say, it remains unclear whether the expansion process is isotropic
in three dimensions so that the relative orientation of the sample
components remains unchanged. Tinnefeld and co-workers have used DNA
nanorulers to evaluate the expansion factor of the polymer network
on the relevant nano- and microscales.23 They reported a microscopic expansion factor of ∼3×
with a homogeneous distribution throughout the sample. However, this
finding proved that the isotropic expansion of the polymer network
itself does not yet completely excludes the introduction of distortions
in an actual biological sample. As previously reported by Tillberg
et al., incomplete homogenization of the sample’s mechanical
characteristics could alter the behavior of the hydrogel.24 Furthermore, the use of DNA nanorulers only
enabled the quantification of the expansion process in the x- and y-dimension and only close to the
glass interface, where, as suggested by the authors themselves, the
expansion factor might be reduced due to frictional forces. Therefore,
several other methods are currently being used to calculate the expansion
factor and evaluate the isotropic expansion in an actual biological
sample. Originally, Boyden et al. evaluated their expansion process
by comparing the post-ExM image to the pre-ExM image. However, the
expansion process is hereby only quantified in the xy-plane. Due to optical sectioning with a confocal microscope and
due to the sample expansion in the z-dimension, it
is impossible to acquire the same features in the pre- and the postexpansion
images. As such, the images cannot always be successfully compared.
Other ways to quantify the expansion process of a biological sample,
e.g., by making use of a nuclear pore complex,25 again require the application of additional super-resolution
imaging approaches such as STED18,20 or SIM,22 revoking the purpose of using ExM as an alternative
for super-resolution (SR) microscopy. For these reasons and considering
the heterogeneous distribution of the expansion factor (EF) in the
hands of different scientists, verifying the isotropy of the expansion
process of biological samples remains a key challenge.

Here,
we propose a concept that addresses the quantification of
the expansion process in 3D, within biological samples and without
the need for other super-resolution approaches. Through fluorescence
photobleaching, the photochemical process by which fluorochromes permanently
lose the ability to fluoresce due to photon-induced modification,26 we created an intrinsic ruler under the form
of a well-defined cube inside the cell’s nucleus (Figure 1). Subsequent comparison
of these structures with the postexpansion image easily reveals the
isotropic nature of expansion microscopy in both lateral and axial
dimensions. Introducing a bleached cubical feature within a biological
sample has several advantages over the comparison of pre- and postexpansion
images. First, the bleached cube provides the sample with a regular
geometrical shape, instead of more random features, thus rendering
the subsequent data analysis an easier, more immediate, and, possibly,
more robust task. Furthermore, photobleaching emphasizes pixel intensity
differences, dramatically simplifying image segmentation. As a consequence
of the previous point, photobleaching permits to easily identify the
same sample area pre- and postexpansion, which can otherwise be a
challenging task due to similarities of patterns present in the sample.
Although we use two-photon excitation (2PE) to assess the isotropy
in 3D, our method operates on two-dimensional projections of 3D image
stacks; therefore, it is directly applicable to the data resulting
from both one- and two-photon excitation experiments.

evaluation of the expansion process. (A) Using photobleaching, a well-defined
cube is bleached in an EGFP-stained nucleus. (B) Photobleached samples
are then embedded in the polymer matrix, expanded, and imaged in 3D

Results
and Discussion
Creating Well-Defined Bleaching Patterns
in 3D
To obtain
a well-defined 3D photobleached structure in a biological sample,
we selected the cell’s nucleus as a target of choice due to
its micrometer scale, presence in all biological samples, and suitability
for uniform labeling (see below). Preferentially, the resulting photobleached
cube has a high contrast along x-, y-, and z-axis and the edges of its structure fit
well within the boundaries of the cell’s nucleus. Although
we have explored the commonly used nuclear 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) staining for the introduction of photobleached cubes, we noticed
a partial recovery of the fluorescent signal in the postexpansion
image, likely due to the inability to cross-link the DAPI molecule
to the polymer network (Figure S3). Eventually,
for demonstrating the full potential of the analysis methodology,
we selected the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). Besides
the fact that eGFP can be directly cross-linked to the polymer matrix,
fluorescent proteins such as GFP are the labels of choice in other
photobleaching-based assays such as in fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP) as they are known to bleach quite easily and
irreversibly while being rather stable under low-intensity imaging
conditions, which is desirable for postexpansion imaging.27 The rate at which GFP bleaches can be fine-tuned
and varies among different GFP mutants.28−30 As such, we first transfected
HeLa cells with a vector for nuclear eGFP expression to generate photobleached
cubic structures inside the nucleus. While a uniformly distributed
signal was observed, the nucleus of the cells was relatively flattened.
Hence, the height of the cell’s nucleus was not sufficient
to fit the typical z-dimension of a bleached cube.
Next, we tested different photobleaching conditions in a HeLa cell
line stably expressing histone2B-eGFP. The expression of the histone2B-eGFP
indeed gives more volume to the nucleus. However, here we found that
due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the eGFP signal throughout
the nucleus, squares showed irregular shapes. Finally, we selected
the histone2B-eGFP expressing cells, further transfected with the
vector for nuclear eGFP expression, as our target of choice. We empirically
determined the optimal bleaching conditions for this target, starting
with one-photon excitation (1PE). While standard confocal microscopy
with 1PE utilizes a pinhole to exclude out-of-focus light originating
from the emission, the excitation light does excite and thus photobleaches
fluorophores throughout the specimen. While the borders of the cube
are well-defined in the xy-dimension, 1PE does not
allow to acquire well-defined 3D structures in the z-dimension, which fit our requirements. In more detail, bleaching
conditions used in Figure 2A were not sufficient to provide a high enough contrast between
the bleached and nonbleached areas, especially in the z-dimension, as can be concluded from the normalized intensity profile.
While repetitive scanning did improve the contrast in each dimension,
the edges of the cube in the z-dimension were still
not well-defined (Figure 2B). Further increasing the number of repeated scanning steps
resulted in cubes that completely exceed the boundaries of the nucleus
(Figure 2C), making
downstream segmentation in the axial direction difficult or impossible.
This can be concluded from both the fluorescence images and the corresponding
normalized intensity profiles along the z-dimension.
To exclude the impact of photobleaching introduced in out-of-focus
planes on the dimensions of our photobleached cube, we performed a
similar experiment where we tested different bleaching parameters
with 2PE. The concept of 2PE employs the absorption of two photons,
each carrying approximately half the energy needed for excitation
in a single quantum event. As the probability for this nearly simultaneous
absorption of two photons is only high enough in the focal volume,
the spread of the excitation volume along the z-dimension
is substantially lower in 2PE, reducing the photobleaching of emitters
outside the focal plane.31 Here, the laser
power used to generate the image in Figure 2D was insufficient to result in a highly
contrasted cube, even after seven repetitive scans. By increasing
the laser power but reducing the frame repetition to four or five
times (Figure 2E,F
respectively), better contrast was observed. Thus, as expected for
2PE, we did notice an overall more confined structure when looking
at the z cross section of the cube. We now aim at
demonstrating the utility of photobleaching to extract the EF in both
lateral and axial dimensions.

Figure 2 Empirically determined optimal bleaching conditions

(1PE) and two-photon (2PE) excitations. For each condition, both the xy-plane and the orthogonal view of the zy-plane are shown. Additionally, normalized intensity profiles registered
along the z-direction (white solid lines) are included.
Upper panel: 1PE with a laser power of 8.7 μW, a pixel dwell
time of 2.09 μs, and a repetition of (A) 3, (B) 10, and (C)
20 frames. Lower panel: 2PE with (D) a laser power of 3.9 mW, a pixel
dwell time of 2.09 μs, and a repetition of seven frames and
(E) a laser power of 6.3 mW, a pixel dwell time of 2.09 μs,
and a repetition of five frames or (F) a repetition of four frames.
Pixel sizes varied depending on the area selected. All laser powers
were measured at the objective. Scale bars: 5 μm.

Evaluation of the Expansion Process in 3D
Using the
optimal photobleaching conditions (Figure 2E,F) for the generation of the cubes in the
cell’s nucleus, we first quantified the expansion factor. After
photobleaching, z-stacks of the photobleached cube
were acquired both pre- and postexpansion. Next, the expansion factor
can be easily extracted by dividing the dimensions of the cube after
expansion by the dimensions pre-expansion. As such, for the cell in Figure 3, we obtained an
expansion factor of 4.9×, which is 0.4× higher than the
expansion factor reported in the first example of ExM.9 However, expansion factors may vary due to small differences
in the composition of the monomer solution or due to the efficiency
of sample homogenization.

factors calculated for each corresponding pixel line in the x-, y-, and z-dimensions
for the example shown in (A) and (B). Lines represent median values.
In z-dimension, we clearly see a broader distribution
for the expansion factor, as the resolution in this dimension is typically
lower. Single outliers that originate from the pixels at the borders
of the square that were below 2 and above 10 were removed, as they
are not representative of the actual expansion factor. Outliers that
originated from pixel lines in the middle of the square were never
removed. (D) Size, median value, and median absolute deviation (MAD)
of the sample distributions plotted in (C).

Second, the expansion process was evaluated in three dimensions.
Even though the photobleaching approach enables an assessment of the
expansion process by eye, we demonstrate how to trace potentially
introduced distortions in the postexpanded sample using a quantitative
approach. By comparing the actual length of each individual pixel
line in the pre-expansion image to its corresponding pixel line in
the postexpansion image, local expansion factors can be obtained.
To make sure that we compare the same planes, we first define the
image that displays the middle plane of the cube for each dimension.
The resulting local expansion factors were plotted together with their
median value in a violin plot. We opted for the median value, as it
is less influenced by outliers. We noted that outliers are expected
for each data set, as the segmented square always shows a few rows
with a small number of pixels (Figure S1). However, outliers that originated from the first three lines containing
few pixels were excluded from the plot for better visualization. In
the first example, we show a cube where the median of the expansion
factors for each dimension is almost identical (Figure 3). Furthermore, distributions are very narrow
for the x- and y-dimensions, with
a median absolute deviation (MAD) value of less than 0.1×. The
MAD value represents the median of the absolute deviation of the different
data points from the data’s median. The distribution of expansion
factors in the z-dimension is typically wider, with
a MAD value of 0.4×, which we expected due to the intrinsic lower
resolution of the microscope in the axial direction. To report possible
local distortions, which have no direct effect on the median values
or the MAD value, we introduce another parameter. This parameter is
represented by the slope of the plot of the number of pixels along
the x-dimension as a function of the pixel line (Figure S2). As a photobleached square is intrinsically
always straight, the slope of an isotropically expanded square should
approach zero. Local anisotropies and distortions, however, cause
the slope to deviate from zero. Based on this additional parameter
and considering the discussion about the median values and the MAD,
we classified the square in Figure 3 as isotropic (Figure S2A). A second example shows a square that displays a local distortion
along the x-axis (Figure 4). While the median values are slightly more
deviating from each other and the MAD is slightly higher for each
dimension, the clearest effect of the local distortion is represented
in the slope of the plot in Figure S2B.
Additionally, as shown in Table S1, isotropy
along the z-axis has the potential to be concomitant
with isotropy along x- and y-axis.
We noticed this trend for a limited number of samples (three additional
cells measured; Figure S4 and corresponding Table S1). These findings suggest that even when
quantification in 2D is performed, our method is suitable for accurately
assessing the general quality of the expansion procedure.

is typically lower. Single outliers that originate from the pixels
at the borders of the square that were below 2 and above 10 were removed,
as they are not representative of the actual expansion factor. Outliers
that originated from pixel lines in the middle of the square were
never removed. (D) Size, median value, and median absolute deviation
(MAD) of the sample distributions plotted in (C).

Finally, squares that were classified as anisotropic showed an
odd distribution of the expansion factor in the corresponding dimension
(Figure 5C). In the x- and y-dimension, distributions are not
nicely confined and the values below the median span a rather wide
range of expansion factors. This is expected, as the expansion factors
originating from the first and last rows of pixels in the postexpansion
image are rather short due to distortions (Figure 5B). When compared to their corresponding
pixel lines in the original square, this will result in low expansion
factors. Furthermore, the distribution for the z-dimension
clearly shows two regimes, i.e.,
the first group of expansion factors is centered around 5× and
a second around 2×. This result originates from the distortion
observed on the xz-plane (Figure 5B), where the left part of the square appears
less expanded than the right part.

Conclusions
Previously reported approaches to quantify the
expansion process
in fluorescence expansion microscopy did not address this task in
3D or need to be completed by super-resolution techniques. To overcome
these limitations, we developed a new method that uses photobleaching
to permanently mark the sample with a well-defined 3D cube, which
could then serve as an intrinsic reporter for validating isotropic
expansion both in lateral and axial dimensions. We, however, noticed
that for our single-cell experiments, 2PE was needed to obtain a nice
contrast between the bleached square and sample in the axial dimension.
Nevertheless, for laboratories with exclusive access to a confocal
microscope, this strategy also results in a more straightforward way
to evaluate the quality of the expansion process in 2D, as a confocal
setup is perfectly capable of introducing nicely confined structures
in the xy-plane. Although we decided to evaluate
the potential of this new methodology using the cell nucleus with
the overexpression of EGFP, the robustness of the developed data analysis
approach allows different labeling strategies to be explored depending
on the specific sample requirements. With the proposed methodology,
we found that the expansion process intrinsically is isotropic in
3D at the length scales investigated, with an expansion factor of
∼5×. However, we do note that the risk of generating distortions
during the expansion process remains a potential limitation of the
technique. We noticed that some of our samples displayed irregularities.
As the manual transfer of the expanded gels to a poly-lysine-coated
coverslip (for stabilization purposes) is the most critical experimental
stage of our laboratory protocol, we hypothesize that the aforementioned
distortions are somehow induced during the gel transfer stage. If
this could be confirmed in the future, one can develop modified handling
protocols; e.g., one could think of stabilizing the gel during imaging
without transferring it. Regardless, the developed procedure enables
both their fast visual evaluation and more robust quantification of
the local expansion factors.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Transfection
HeLa histone eGFP cells
were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) without phenol-red (Gibco Life Technologies,
Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamax,
and 50 μg/mL gentamicin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Twenty-four hours before transfection, 2.4 × 105 cells suspended in 3 mL of complete growth medium were seeded in
a 35 mm glass-bottom dish (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with
an adhesive silicone isolator (24-well, Grace Bio-Labs) with 4.5 mm
feature well diameter. The pEGFP plasmid was a kind gift from Prof.
Hideaki Mizuno. The vector (50 ng/well) was transfected into cells
with 0.1 μL/well of TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Sixteen hours after transfection,
the cells were washed once with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at
room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed twice with
PBS, permeabilized for 15 min using PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100,
and washed three times for 5 min using PBS before proceeding to photobleaching.

Photobleaching
All photobleaching experiments reported
in Figures 3–5 were performed with two-photon excitation using
a Leica TCS SP8 X system (Leica Microsystems) equipped with a Mai
Tai DeepSee laser (Spectra-Physics) and a 63× NA 1.2 objective
lens. The desired region, defined as a regular xy-plane, was exposed to a laser power of 6.3 mW at 968 nm, with a
pixel dwell time of 2.09 μs per pixel. Each frame was scanned
four times under the above-mentioned conditions. The focal volume
was positioned more or less at the center of the z cross section of the nucleus to prevent the bleached area from overlapping
the edges of the nucleus and causing the corners of the square to
be undefined. Squares were found to typically have an axial height
of 5–10 μm. For imaging the nucleus containing the bleached
volume, a z-stack series was acquired using the confocal
setup and white light laser at 488 nm and following the Nyquist criterion
for the determination of both the z-step size and
the pixel size.

Gelation, Digestion, and Expansion
Sample expansion
was performed as described previously. In brief, the cells were incubated
for 12 h in 0.1 mg/mL Acryloyl-X, SE (ThermoFisher Scientific) at
room temperature and washed two times for 15 min with PBS. Monomer
solution (1× PBS, 2 M NaCl, 8.625% w/w sodium acrylate, 2.5%
w/w acrylamide, and 0.15% w/w N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) was prepared, frozen in aliquots,
and thawed before use. To perform the gelation step, the monomer solution
was enriched with 0.15% tetramethylenediamine (TEMED) and 0.15% ammonium
persulfate (APS) at 4 °C to prevent premature gelation, and 20
μL of this solution was added to each silicone isolator well
to embed the cells. Gelation took place at 37 °C for 1 h. Next,
the silicone isolator wells were carefully removed and the gels were
incubated in 2–3 mL of proteinase K (New England Biolabs) diluted
to 8 U/mL in digestion buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.8 M guanidine HCl) for 12 h at room
temperature. Digested gels were next immersed in Milli-Q water, which
was exchanged every hour for five times to ensure complete expansion.
Upon reaching a plateau of the expansion process, the gels were transferred
to a six-well glass bottom plate, coated with poly-d-lysine.
The gels were transferred by making use of a 60 × 24 mm2 #1.5 coverslip and a paintbrush.

Fluorescence Microscopy
After completing cross-linking,
polymerization, homogenization, and expansion, the bleached cubes
were retrieved in the expanded gel using a low-magnification objective
first. The postexpansion image acquisition was performed by the same
Leica TCS SP8 X confocal system equipped with a 20× NA 1.20 objective
lens. The expanded samples were immersed in Milli-Q water to keep
the gels in their fully expanded state during image acquisition. Each
nucleus containing a bleached cube was imaged in 3D using a white-light
laser set at 488 nm for excitation, with 1 Airy unit and Nyquist sampling
for both the z-step size and the pixel size.

Data Analysis
To compare the actual dimensions of the
cube pre- and postexpansion, stacks of the pre- and postexpanded samples
were preprocessed using Fiji. In detail, the postexpansion stack was
rotated to match the angle of the pre-expansion stack, and the xy-plane lying in the middle of the cube’s height
(i.e., the z-dimension)
was used for analyzing the distribution of expansion factors along x- and y-dimension. Next, as the histogram
of the intensities of the postexpansion images is typically less spread
out, it was rescaled. After this, pre- and postexpansion images were
segmented using an intensity-based threshold; a median filter was
applied to smoothen the images without perturbing the features’
edges. The squares present in the selected images were selected as
a region of interest (ROI), and downstream analysis was run on such
a selection to extract the distribution of the expansion factors in
the x- and y-dimension. This was
achieved by first matching the dimensions of the pre- and postexpansion
squares such that each individual pixel line could be measured and
compared. Afterward, the number of black pixels for each pixel line
both along x- and y-dimension was
counted, the number of black pixels was multiplied by the pixel size,
and the actual dimension (in microns) of each pixel line in the postexpansion
image was divided by the actual length of the corresponding pixel
line in the pre-expansion image to obtain the expansion factor. Finally,
all expansion factors for each dimension were plotted in a violin
plot using https://huygens.science.uva.nl/PlotsOfData/. For the z-dimension, stacks were resliced in Fiji such that they
displayed images of the xz- or yz-plane as a function of the y- or x-dimension, respectively; afterward, the stacks were treated exactly
the same way as described above.
