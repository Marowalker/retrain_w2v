Transparent flexible silicone materials
are useful in electronics,
sensors, coatings, and so forth. However, to the best of our knowledge,
the tensile strength of unreinforced silicone rubber is lower than
0.4 MPa, and the highest tensile strength of highly transparent silicone-modified
materials is no more than 1.5 MPa. The poor mechanical property limits
their further application in electronic devices. Here, a kind of UV-cured
transparent flexible silicone materials with tensile strength as high
as 2.2 MPa were prepared by a UV-initiated thiol–ene reaction
of a sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane and a thiol silicone
resin. Interestingly, their tensile strength can increase from 2.2
to 5.6 and 5.7 MPa after being immersed in an aqueous solution of
10 wt % hydrochloric acid and 10 wt % NaCl for 7 days, respectively.
It is argued that the increase of the tensile strength of cured films
may be attributed to the −SiOCH3 of the residual
3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol in the sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane. The performances of the cured materials were investigated
in detail. These silicone materials exhibit transparency higher than
95% (wavenumber in the range of 400–800 nm), and the initial
thermal decomposition temperatures of the cured materials are about
340 °C. These materials also show good anticorrosion property,
and the mass loss of the materials immersed in the aqueous solution
mediums is no more than 0.39 wt % even for 15 days.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Transparent
silicone materials have outstanding properties including
good flexibility, ultraviolet (UV) resistance, thermal resistance,
dimensional stability, a wide range of service temperatures, high
transparency, and minimal moisture absorption.1−5 Therefore, they have been widely used in electronics,2 sensors,3 coatings,4,5 and so forth. However, to the best of our knowledge, the tensile
strength of the unreinforced silicone with high transparency is no
more than 0.4 MPa.6,7 Incorporation of various inorganic
fillers such as nano-SiO28 and
carbon nanotubes9 into a polysiloxane matrix
has been shown to improve the mechanical properties, but at the expense
of lower transparency. Even so far, the tensile strength of the chemical-modified
transparent silicone materials is no more than 1.5 MPa.7,8,10−13 Seriously, the drawbacks of poor
mechanical properties limit their further application in electronic
devices,8,10 and efforts should be made to improve the
tensile strength of transparent silicone materials.

On the other
hand, it is noteworthy that corrosion is an obstacle
for engineering applications.14−16 Silicone coatings have been reported
to be anticorrosion layers because of the chemical inertness attributed
by the Si–O–Si network.16−18 Nevertheless, these
coatings possess a glassy-like behavior, which will be quite brittle.19 Polycarbosilanes are a class of polymers at
the interface between organic and inorganic chemistry, whose Si–C
bond is less susceptible to the nucleophilic attack than the Si–O
bonds in siloxanes contributed to the relative stability of the carbosilane.20,21 The cross-linkable carbosilane polymers exhibit intriguing physical
and chemical properties, which could be used as anticorrosion coatings.22,23 A silicon-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane, particularly
phosphorus-hyperbranched carbosilanes, and a sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane have emerged promising applications in polymer-derived
ceramics, room-temperature-vulcanized silicone rubber, high-temperature-vulcanized
silicone rubber, and coatings.20,24,25 Inspired by these efforts, the silicon-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane may be used to improve the corrosion resistance of
the materials.

Finally, as we know, transparent silicone materials
prepared by
traditional curing methods suffer from the disadvantages of long curing
time and high energy consumption.26,27 The UV curing
method has drawn much attention in the fields of electronics, coatings,
printing inks, and adhesives owing to their numerous merits over the
traditional thermal curing method including low volatile organic compounds
emissions, low energy consumption, fast curing at ambient temperature,
and short cycle time.5,26−28 The thiol–ene
reaction initiated by UV light has been used increasingly in polymer
synthesis because of their merits such as highly effective under mild
reaction conditions, without a photoinitiator, extremely tolerant
to a variety of functional groups, without oxygen inhibition, and
lack of byproduct.21,29−34 Therefore, the thiol–ene reaction has been utilized to prepare
silicone elastomers under mild reaction conditions.35,36

To overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, attempts were made
to
prepare transparent flexible silicone materials through UV-initiated
thiol–ene reaction with the sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane. In this work, we are pleased to report the synthesis
and properties of a kind of transparent flexible silicone materials
with a tensile strength as high as 2.2 MPa prepared by the UV-initiated
thiol–ene reaction. Interestingly, the materials show good
anticorrosion property, and their tensile strength can increase from
2.2 to 5.6 and 5.7 MPa after being immersed in the aqueous solution
of 10 wt % hydrochloric acid and 10 wt % NaCl for 7 days, respectively.

2.2 Synthesis
of the Sulfur-Containing Hyperbranched
Polycarbosilane
The method of synthesis of sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane is shown in Figure 1 according to ref (37). All the reactions were performed under argon
atmosphere. Magnesium powder (18.0 g, 0.75 mol), 300 mL of ether,
and a grain of iodine were placed in a clean and dry three-mouthed
bottle. The mixture was maintained at 0–5 °C, and 120
mL of ether and 75.6 g (0.63 mol) of 3-bromopropene were added to
the mixture for about 120 min. Then, 28.550 g (0.145 mol) of 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol
and 250 mL of ether were added to the mixture and stirred at room
temperature overnight. Later, the reaction was terminated by 200 mL
of methanol and then filtered. After evaporating the solvent in vacuum,
27.8 g crude product of mercaptopropyl triallyl silane is obtained.
The crude product was distilled by vacuum, and a 12.7 g colorless
transparent liquid of the reaction at about 150 °C under 120
°C/20 mmHg was collected. Finally, the sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane was prepared by a thiol-click reaction for 30 s initiated
by UV (ZB1000, Changzhou Zibo Electron Technology Co. Ltd., laser
wavelength 365 nm, laser power 1000 W).

and 220 g of toluene were added into a 1000 mL three-necked bottle,
the mixture was stirred and heated to 50 °C, and then 8.80 g
of hydrochloric acid and 150 g of deionized water were added to the
mixture for about 60 min. Subsequently, the mixture was maintained
at 60 °C for 3 h. The pH value of the organic phase was adjusted
to 7 using deionized water. Later, the solvent and the low-boiling
residues in the organic phase were removed under 120 °C/20 mmHg,
and a transparent liquid was produced. 1H NMR (400 MHz,

2.4 Preparation
of Transparent Flexible Silicone
Materials Based on the Sulfur-Containing Hyperbranched Polycarbosilane
by UV
The mixtures of sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane
and thiol silicone resin were deposited on the slides with about 1
mm thickness by spin-coating under a rotation speed of 3000 r/s for
30 s and then cured by UV (ZB1000, Changzhou Zibo Electron Technology
Co., Ltd., laser wavelength 365 nm, laser power 1000 W, and the distance
of the slides to the light is 20 cm).

2.5 Characterization
The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker AVANCE
AV400 (400 MHz) spectrometer
in CDCl3 at room temperature without tetramethylsilane
as the internal reference. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy
analysis was carried out using a Nicolet 700 spectrometer (Nicolet
Co., Ltd., American) over the frequency range of 4000–650 cm–1 with an attenuated total reflection appendix. Transmittance
spectra (placed in a 10 mm thick quartz absorption cell) were measured
on a Unico UV-4802 UV/vis spectrophotometer (Unico Instrument Co.,
Ltd., Shanghai) in the range of 400–800 nm. The pencil hardness
of the cured samples was measured with a BGD-562 Pencil hardness meter
(Zhenwei Testing Machinery Co Ltd, Jiangdu, China) according to GBT6739-2006.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a TG 209C apparatus
(Germany), in which samples were heated from ambient temperature to
800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1 in a nitrogen
atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curves were recorded
on a DSC Q100 apparatus under nitrogen atmosphere with a carrier gas
flow rate of 20 mL min–1. The samples were heated
to 100 °C, held for 2 min to erase the thermal history, then
cooled to −100 °C at a rate of 10 °C min–1, and finally heated again to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10
°C min–1. The degree of curing contents of
the mixtures of sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane and
thiol silicone resins was measured by Soxhlet extraction with toluene
at 150 °C for 4 h. The adhesion was measured with a BGD-502 paint
film according to ISO 2409-2007. Water absorption was measured according
to the “Determination of water absorption rate of insullac
films” HGT 3856-2006. The surface water contact angle was measured
according to the “Measurement of water-contact angle of plastic
films” GB/T 30693-2014 on a KRUSS DSA30 water contact angle
meter (KRÜSS, Germany). The tensile test was carried out according
to GB/T 528-2009/ISO 37:2005 on an UH6503D electronic tensile testing
machine (Optimal Hung Measurement & Control Technology) (Shanghai)
Co. Ltd. The corrosion resistance to acid, alkali, and salt was carried
out with a water solution of 10 wt % hydrochloric acid and 10 wt %
sulfuric acid, 10 wt % sodium hydroxide, and 10 wt % sodium chloride,
respectively, at room temperature.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Analysis of Sulfur-Containing
Hyperbranched
Polycarbosilanes
Sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilanes
were prepared by the thiol-click reaction of mercaptopropyl triallyl
silane by UV at various reaction times, and the 1H NMR
spectra are shown by Figures 2 and S1. The
chemical shifts of the sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilanes
can be assigned as follows: 0.47–0.97 (−SCH2CH2CH2Si−),
1.24–1.40 (HSCH2CH2CH2Si−), 1.41–1.73 (−CH2CH=CH2), 1.73–1.99
(−SCH2CH2−), 2.24–2.66 (−CH2SCH2−),
2.70–2.84 (HSCH2CH2CH2Si−), 3.25–3.66 (−OCH3), 4.68–5.01 (−CH2CH=CH2), and
5.60–5.95 (−CH2CH=CH2). The molar ratio of −CH2CH=CH2 to HSCH2CH2CH2Si– and the content of −SiOCH3 and
−CH2CH=CH2 in the sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilanes prepared at various UV reaction times
can be calculated by the ratio of the chemical shift integral area
of −CH2CH=CH2, HSCH2CH2CH2Si–, and −OCH3 (Table 1). It can be seen from Table 1 that the molar ratio of −CH2CH=CH2 to HSCH2CH2CH2Si–
is about 3.0, and the content of −SiOCH3 is about
0.00229 mol/g when the UV reaction time is 0, which means the Grignard
reaction is not complete. The molar ratio of −CH2CH=CH2 to HSCH2CH2CH2Si– (about 9.0:1) and the content of −CH2CH=CH2 almost remained unchanged when the
UV reaction time prolongs from 30 to 90 s. Therefore, the sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane prepared by UV for 30 s was used at
the following investigation.

hyperbranched polycarbosilanes

3.2 Effect
of Curing Time
The mixture
of sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane and thiol silicone
resin can be cured quickly without a UV initiator. The effect of curing
time was investigated. The sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane
was prepared by UV for 30 s, and the thiol silicone resin is with
R/Si = 1.4 and the thiol group content is 0.004 mol/g. The sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane and the thiol silicone resin were mixed
according to n(HSCH2CH2CH2Si−)/n(−CH2CH=CH2) = 0.6:1 and deposited on slides. The surface water contact
angles of the cured materials are fairly high, which are in the range
of 103.1–106.2°. It can be seen from Table 2 that both the pencil hardness
and the surface water contact angle of the films increased with the
increase of reaction time when the reaction time is lesser than 30
s. However, a further increment of curing time over 30 s almost has
no influence on the pencil hardness and the surface water contact
angle of the films. These phenomena might be explained as the mixture
was cured completely by UV for 30 s. The FT-IR spectra of the cured
films shown in Figure 3 provide evidence for this opinion. The characteristic stretching
vibration absorption peak of =C–H in the allyl group
at 3074 cm–1 disappeared quickly even when the mixture
is only cured for 10 s. The characteristic vibration absorption peak
of C=C in the allyl group at 1627 cm–1 and
the weak characteristic absorption peak of HS at 2550 cm–1 have become smaller and smaller with the prolongation of the curing
time and almost vanished when the mixture is cured for 30 s by UV.
The area of characteristic absorption peak of Si–O–Si
at 1040 cm–1 is unchanged.

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra of the
films cured for various times, the sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane was prepared by UV for 30 s, and the
thiol silicone resin is with R/Si = 1.4 and the thiol group content
is 0.004 mol·g–1.

a Conditions: The
sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane was prepared by UV for 30 s. The thiol
silicone resin is with R/Si = 1.4, and the thiol group content is
0.004 mol·g–1. The sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane and the thiol silicone resin were mixed according
to n(HSCH2CH2CH2Si−)/n(−CH2CH=CH2) = 1.1:1.

3.3 Effect of R/Si Ratios for the Thiol Silicone
Resins
The effect of R/Si ratios for the thiol silicone resin
on the cured materials are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the pencil hardness
of the films decreased with the increase of the R/Si ratio. The degree
of curing content is fairly high (87.3–97.1%), and the degree
of curing content reaches the highest when the R/Si ratio is 1.4.
The R/Si ratios have less effect on the surface water contact angle,
which is in the range of 101.5–104.4°.

4	1.6	2B	87.3	104.4	
a Conditions: The sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane was prepared by UV for 30 s. The thiol
group content of the thiol silicone resin is 0.004 mol·g–1. The sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane
and the thiol silicone resin were mixed according to n(HSCH2CH2CH2Si−)/n(−CH2CH=CH2) = 1.1:1.
The materials were cured for 30 s by UV.

DSC analysis is an effective method to measure the
glass-transition
temperature (Tg), and Tg increases with the increase of cross-linking density
because cross-linking makes the polymer molecules become continuously
stacked to form polymer chains.5,38 It can be seen from Figure 4 that the glass-transition
temperature of the cured materials decreases from 4.83 to −31.44
°C with the increase of the R/Si ratio. It can be concluded that
the cured materials have good flexibility.38

Figure 4 DSC
curve of the cured materials prepared from thiol silicone resins
with various of R/Si ratios.

3.4 Effect of Various Thiol Contents of Thiol
Silicone Resins
The effect of thiol content of the silicone
resins was also investigated as given by Table 4. The pencil hardness of the cured materials
increased obviously with the increase of the thiol content of the
silicone resins, which may be due to the increase of the cross-lining
density of the cured materials obtained. The degree of curing content
reaches the highest when the thiol content of the silicone resin is
0.004 mol·g–1. There is an obvious decline
for the surface water contact angle of the cured materials when the
thiol content of the silicone resin is 0.006 mol·g–1, which may be due to the decline of the amount of thiol silicone
resin caused by the high thiol content.

a Conditions: The
sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane was prepared by UV for 30 s. The R/Si
ratio of the thiol silicone resin is 1.4. The sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane and the thiol silicone resin were mixed according
to n(HSCH2CH2CH2Si−)/n(−CH2CH=CH2) = 1.1:1. The materials were cured for 30 s by UV.

The molar ratios of SH to allyl
have significant effect on the
performance of the cured materials as given by Table 5. The pencil hardness of the cured materials
increased with the increase of the molar ratios of SH to allyl when
the molar ratios of SH to allyl are in the range of 0.4–1.3.
A further increment of the molar ratios of SH to allyl will lead to
the decline of the pencil hardness of the cured materials. In general,
the pencil hardness of the cured materials is in the range of 6B and
9H, which can be tuned by adjustment of the molar ratios of SH to
allyl. The degree of curing content of the cured materials is fairly
high when the molar ratios of SH to allyl are in the range of 0.7–1.1,
which means that the materials are cured more completely at this time.

3.5 Tensile Strength and the Corrosion Resistance
Performance to Acid, Alkali, and Salt
As we know, the tensile
strength of unreinforced silicone with high transparency is no more
than 0.4 MPa.6,7 The tensile strength of silicone
can be improved by incorporation of various inorganic fillers such
as nano-SiO28 and carbon nanotubes9 into the polysiloxane matrix at the expense of
lower transparency. So far, the tensile strength of chemical-modified
transparent silicone materials is still no more than 1.5 MPa.7,8,10−13 The drawbacks of poor mechanical
properties seriously limit the further application of transparent
silicone materials in electronic devices. Interestingly, the tensile
strength of the cured materials prepared is as high as 2.2 MPa (Table 6). It is obvious that
the tensile strength of all the films immersed in the various corrosion
media increased. Remarkably, the tensile strength can increase from
2.2 to 5.6 and 5.7 MPa after being immersed in the aqueous solution
of 10 wt % hydrochloric acid and 10 wt % NaCl for 7 days, respectively.

a The films were entry 3 in Table 2.

The increase of tensile strength after being immersed
may be attributed
to the residual alkoxy groups of 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol during
the course of preparation of sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane.
As it can be seen from Figure 2 and Table 1, there is −SiOCH3 in the residual 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol.
The residual 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol can react with −CH2CH=CH2 of the sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane to produce sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane
with −SiOCH3, which will hydrolyze in the aqueous
solution mediums and reinforce the cured silicone materials.39 As discussed by the previous work, the alkoxy
groups of the silicone coating can react with the hydroxyl counterparts
on the activated metal substrates, which can improve the anticorrosion
features of the materials.15,40

c,d: (1) Aqueous
solution of 10 wt % hydrochloric acid (36.5%),
(2) aqueous solution of 10 wt % NaOH, (3) aqueous solution of 10 wt
% NaCl, (4) deionized water, and (5) aqueous solution of 10 wt % H2SO4 (98.0%).

The challenge in developing
protection barriers from corrosion
is to develop an efficient method for the coating material.15 It is found that the transparent UV-cured silicone
materials obtained are candidates of anticorrosion coating with good
resistance to acid, alkali, and salt. It can be seen from Figures 5 and 6 that the cured materials exhibit high transparency. The transparency
of the films are all higher than 95% (wavenumber in the range of 400–800
nm) even being immersed for 15 days in various aqueous solution mediums.
It can be seen from Figure 5 and Table 6 that the surface water contact angle of all the films immersed in
media decreased, which may be attributed to the hydrolysis of −SiOCH3 and depolymerization caused by corrosion of Si–O–Si. Table 6 exhibits that the
mass loss of the materials being immersed in the aqueous solution
mediums is no more than 0.39 wt %, which may be attributed to the
chemical inertness of networks by Si–O–Si16 and Si–C bond of sulfur-containing hyperbranched
polycarbosilane.20−23 From the discussion above, it can be concluded that the UV-cured
transparent flexible silicone materials have good anticorrosion property.

Figure 6 Transparency of the cured films before and after being immersed
in various aqueous solution mediums for 15 days.

The TGA curves of UV-cured materials before and after being immersed
in various aqueous solution mediums are shown in Figure 7. The initial thermal decomposition
temperature of the cured material before being immersed is about 340
°C, which is higher than those of the silicone resins (about
200 °C) reported by our group previously41 and the alkyd-silicone hyperbranched resins (about 310 °C)
reported by ref (29). Therefore, it can be concluded that the UV-cured silicone materials
obtain are with superior thermal stability. It can also be seen obviously
that, despite the initial thermal decomposition temperatures of the
cured silicone material before and after being immersed in various
aqueous solution mediums are almost the same, the mass residue of
the immersed materials are higher than that of the materials before
being immersed. It can also be ascribed to the hydrolysis of residual
−OCH3 in 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol.

4 Conclusions
Silicone materials with high
transparency, high tensile strength,
and outstanding resistance to acid, alkali, and salt were prepared
by the UV-initiated thiol–ene reaction of a sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane and a thiol silicone resin. The tensile
strength of the materials obtained can reach 2.2 MPa. Interestingly,
their tensile strength can increase from 2.2 to 5.6 and 5.7 MPa after
being immersed in an aqueous solution of 10 wt % hydrochloric acid
and 10 wt % NaCl for 7 days, respectively. It is argued that the increase
of the tensile strength of cured films may be attributed to the −SiOCH3 of the residual 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol in the sulfur-containing
hyperbranched polycarbosilane. Whether being immersed or not, the
materials obtained are with a transparency higher than 95% (wavenumber
in the range of 400–800 nm), and the initial thermal decomposition
temperature of the cured material is about 340 °C. The mass loss
of the materials immersed in the aqueous solution mediums is no more
than 0.39 wt % even for 15 days. It can be concluded that the UV-cured
materials are with good resistance to acid, alkali, and salt.
