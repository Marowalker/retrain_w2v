The ion-pumping NADH: ubiquinone dehydrogenase (NQR)
is a vital component of the respiratory chain of numerous species
of marine and pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio
cholerae. This respiratory enzyme couples the transfer
of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone (UQ) to the pumping of ions across
the plasma membrane, producing a gradient that sustains multiple homeostatic
processes. The binding site of UQ within the enzyme is an important
functional and structural motif that could be used to design drugs
against pathogenic bacteria. Our group recently located the UQ site
in the interface between subunits B and D and identified the residues
within subunit B that are important for UQ binding. In this study,
we carried out alanine scanning mutagenesis of amino acid residues
located in subunit D of V. cholerae NQR to understand their role in UQ binding and enzymatic catalysis.
Moreover, molecular docking calculations were performed to characterize
the structure of the site at the atomic level. The results show that
mutations in these positions, in particular, in residues P185, L190,
and F193, decrease the turnover rate and increase the Km for UQ. These
mutants also showed an increase in the resistance against the inhibitor
HQNO. The data indicate that residues in subunit D fulfill important
structural roles, restricting and orienting UQ in a catalytically
favorable position. In addition, mutations of these residues open
the site and allow the simultaneous binding of substrate and inhibitors,
producing partial inhibition, which appears to be a strategy used
by Pseudomonas aeruginosa to avoid
autopoisoning.

==== Body
Introduction
The facultative
aerobic, Gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae most often grows in saltwater marine
ecosystems, but certain strains can also colonize the human intestine,
causing cholera, the life-threatening diarrheal disease. Cholera is
closely associated with natural disasters and war-torn regions where
clean water supplies are unavailable or tainted.1,2 In
high salinity environments and in the human small intestine, this
microorganism is able to thrive due to its ability to pump sodium
ions across the cell membrane, creating a sodium motive force (SMF).3 The SMF can be utilized to power essential cellular
processes, such as flagellar rotation, substrate transport, pH regulation,
and ATP synthesis.3−8 In V. cholerae, the
SMF is generated by the NADH: quinone oxidoreductase enzyme complex
(NQR),3 which couples the transfer of electrons
from NADH to ubiquinone (UQ) to the pumping of sodium ions.8−14 In V. cholerae, it
has been shown that NQR regulates the transcription of the ToxT gene, which positively regulates the production of
the cholera toxin, toxin coregulated pili, and accessory colonization
factor.15,16 Mutations to the nqr operon,
as well as NQR inhibitors, decrease the transcription of the toxT gene resulting in decreased production of the cholera
toxin and other virulence factors.

NQR is composed of six subunits
(A–F) and five confirmed redox cofactors that facilitate electron
transfer: flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), 2Fe–2S center,
two covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactors, and riboflavin.8,9,17,18 These
cofactors shuttle electrons from NADH, the initial electron donor,
to UQ, the final electron acceptor.17,19−21 Interestingly, riboflavin’s
use as a cofactor has been solely reported in NQR.17,21,22 Additionally, the covalently linked FMN
cofactors are attached through a unique covalent bond found in a few
other respiratory enzymes.23−26

Electrons from NADH are
initially donated from NADH to the FAD cofactor located in subunit
F and proceed to the other cofactors. From FAD, electrons are transferred
to the 2Fe–2S center, also located within subunit F, to an
FMN cofactor in subunit C. The electrons subsequently move to FMN
in subunit B to riboflavin and finally to UQ.9,21,27 Crystallographic data suggests that an additional
nonheme Fe cofactor could participate in the shuttling of electrons,11 but its presence has not been confirmed experimentally.
The location of the final electron acceptor UQ has been a controversial
topic with two main hypotheses. One model indicates that a binding
site could be located in a hydrophilic pocket within the cytosolic
subunit A, which would be able to accommodate the benzoquinone head,
with the isoprenoid tail probably interacting with subunit B.28,29 However, our group has followed the original hypothesis by Unemoto’s
group30 and the earlier work by Barquera’s
group,20,31 and we have identified that the catalytic
UQ binding site is located in the interface of subunits B and D, deeply
embedded in the membrane core (Figure 1A,C).32 In our experiments,
we used alanine scanning mutagenesis of conserved residues in subunit
B to locate residues involved in UQ binding and catalysis. Moreover,
the functional data were corroborated by molecular docking. Our data
helped us unambiguously locate the catalytic UQ binding site in the
protein and to identify residues F185 and F211 in subunit B as critical
parts of this motif. While the role of subunit B residues is now well
understood, the other part of the UQ binding site has not been studied.
The goal of this project is to characterize the role of residues of
subunit D lining the UQ binding site, through the characterization
of alanine mutants and the use of computational analysis methods.
Our results indicate that although the residues of subunit D are not
conserved, they fulfill important roles, delimiting the UQ binding
site. Moreover, mutations of these residues, which have been reported
in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, confer resistance
against antibiotics targeting this site.33 The identification and characterization of the UQ binding site are
important to understand the catalytic mechanism of NQR, and it has
become evident that it can be used to treat infectious diseases. The
work by Dibrov et al.34 is now showing
that NQR inhibitors that target the UQ binding site clear the infection
by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, which, as recently shown by our group, depends on NQR to maintain
the infection.35

Results
Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis
Alanine scanning mutagenesis was conducted on amino acid residues
of subunit D adjacent to the identified UQ binding pocket to understand
their function. Figure 1 shows the location of these residues within the binding site (Figure 1A,B), and their interactions
with UQ and HQNO (2-n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide) (Figure 1C,D, respectively), an inhibitor that also occupies this site.30,32,36 The residues that were mutated
include F151, L155, L180, P185, F189, L190, and F193, which, as shown
in Figure 1E, are not
conserved in the family, except P185. All of the residues selected
for mutagenesis lie nearby F185 and F211 on subunit B, which were
shown to be essential for UQ binding.32 In our previous report, we showed that most of the residues in subunit
B that form part of the UQ binding pocket are highly conserved. However,
for subunit D, only residue P185 is conserved across bacterial lineages
(Figure 1E), suggesting
that they are not essential for the function of the enzyme. Alanine
was used as a replacement amino acid to remove the bulky functional
groups of the residues (which could interact with UQ) while maintaining
the hydrophobic environment of the pocket. In the case of P185, the
proline-to-glycine substitution is preferred, since glycine has “helix-breaking”
properties similar to proline,37 while
alanine has helix-forming properties.38

Kinetic Characterization of the
Mutants
To determine the role of each residue on enzyme activity
and UQ binding, a kinetic characterization was conducted on the mutants.
Enzyme activity was tested at varying concentrations of UQ at near-saturating
concentrations of NADH (250 μM) and NaCl (50 mM), which allowed
us to determine the turnover rate (kcat) and apparent Km for UQ (KmUQ) for the mutants and compare
it to that of wild-type NQR. For all mutants, the observed kcat was significantly lower compared to wild-type
NQR (Table 1 and Figure 2A).27,33 It should be noted that although all mutants had lower UQ reduction
rates, the nonphysiologic NADH oxidation rates (>550 s–1, not shown) were not affected by the mutations, indicating that
the mutation solely influences the electron transfer following an
initial donation by NADH (likely the transfer of electrons to UQ).
The kinetic data obtained show that mutants P185G, L190A, and F193A
have the lowest kcat. Moreover, the mutants
L190A and F193A show an increase in the KmUQ of 2–3
times, compared to the wild-type enzyme. Interestingly, the P185G
mutant had the lowest KmUQ values of all mutants (Table 1).

a Activity measurements were conducted in the presence of 250 μM
NADH and 50 mM NaCl with different concentrations of UQ-1 or HQNO.
Apparent kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the data from Figure 2 to eq 1, assuming saturating concentrations
of all substrates. Wild-type data was obtained from ref (27).

In addition
to activity characterizations, HQNO titrations were performed with
the mutants. HQNO is a compound naturally produced by different types
of bacteria, including P. aeruginosa.(39,40) This molecule is an inhibitor of many respiratory
enzymes, but it is particularly effective against V.
cholerae NQR, with sub-μM Kiapp values
(Table 1).27,32,36 HQNO was proposed to interact
with the UQ binding site, which would make it a competitive inhibitor
vs UQ. However, the data show that HQNO is a mixed-type inhibitor,36 complicating the interpretation of the data.
Our group showed that HQNO indeed interacts with the UQ binding site,
competing with UQ (giving rise to the competitive component) and with
ubiquinol, the product of the reaction, explaining the uncompetitive
component of the mixed inhibition.27 Titrations
of the activity using HQNO show that most mutants have a similar Kiapp compared to the wild-type enzyme. However, in all cases
tested, the activity could not be completely inhibited with HQNO,
and a resistant component was evident (Figure 2B and Table 1). The mutants P185G, L190A, and F193A showed the highest
HQNO-resistant components. Due to the significant changes observed,
these three mutants were selected for further characterization.

HQNO Inhibitory Mechanism
The
inhibition mechanism of HQNO was studied in the mutants by performing
UQ titrations at varying concentrations of HQNO (Figure 3). The data obtained was globally
fitted to the equation for different types of inhibitors, including
competitive, uncompetitive, mixed (not shown), and mixed partial (eq 1). The data was best fitted
to the function describing mixed-partial-type inhibition, as clearly
shown in the double reciprocal plot with intersecting lines in the
second or third quadrant, characteristic of this type of inhibition
(Figure 3).41 Two inhibition constants were obtained, corresponding
to the competitive and uncompetitive components of the mixed inhibition
(Kic and Kiu), respectively (Table 2). Moreover, the kcatR was also obtained,
corresponding to the kinetic component that is resistant to saturating
concentrations of the inhibitor. This component indicates that the
enzyme can bind the substrate and the inhibitor at the same time and
still be active. As shown in Table 2, the Kic and Kiu values for the mutants are similar (0.1–0.3
μM), consistent with the intercepting pattern near the abscissa.
The inhibitor-resistant component was also calculated for the three
mutants, with values ranging from 30 to 50%, which are comparable
or higher to the values reported for P. aeruginosa NQR,33 which is naturally resistant to
this inhibitor.

a Activity measurements were conducted in the presence of 250 μM
NADH and 50 mM NaCl with different concentrations of UQ-1 or HQNO.
Kinetic parameters were obtained by globally fitting the data from Figure 3 to eq 1. Wild-type data was obtained from
ref (27).

Taken together, the data indicate that these
residues, except P185, play important-but-not-essential roles in the
UQ binding site. P185, the only conserved residue, appears to have
a critical structural role that cannot be fulfilled by glycine or
other residues. Interestingly, the mutation of these residues confers
significant resistance to HQNO.

Molecular
Docking
To understand the role of these residues on the structure
of the UQ binding pocket and their influence on the substrate and
inhibitor binding, molecular docking was performed using the crystal
structure of wild-type V. cholerae NQR
(PDB ID: 4P6V)18 and the predicted structure of the
mutants. The residues were mutated in silico using UCSF Chimera.42Figures 4
and 5 show the lowest energy poses of UQ and
HQNO in the binding pocket, respectively. In wild-type NQR, UQ is
deeply embedded in the binding pocket, interacting closely with F185
and F211 in subunit B (Figures 1B, 4A, and 5A). Interestingly, residues L190 and F193 in subunit D appear as
the “lid” of the pocket (Figure 1B,C), confining UQ in a narrow space in the
site. The mutations of these two residues “open the lid”
and UQ appears to be more superficially bound or rotated (Figure 4B,C), compared to
the position in the wild-type site, which is consistent with the increase
in the Km and kcat observed in these mutants.
UQ is bound outside the binding pocket in the P185G mutant, which
explains the much smaller kcat. However,
docking data could be difficult to interpret in this specific case,
since the structure of the P185G mutant could be very different compared
to our predictions (see below).

of best-docked HQNO in wild type (yellow) and the mutants F193A (red),

The docking data suggest that
HQNO is bound directly to the UQ binding site in the wild-type enzyme
(Figures 1D and 5A). In the L190 and F193 mutants, HQNO is not bound
as deeply, and it appears relatively rotated (Figure 5B,C), consistent with the slight increase
in the Kiapp for this inhibitor. Due to this rotation,
the distance between HQNO and subunit B increases, and it could be
possible to accommodate both UQ and HQNO in this site, a likely explanation
for the partial inhibition. As shown in Figure 4D, the binding of HQNO to mutant P185G is
nearly identical to wild type (Figure 5D).

Discussion
In this work, the role of amino acid residues in NQR subunit D
lining the UQ binding pocket was analyzed. In a previous study, residues
of subunit B within the pocket were shown to be highly conserved across
bacterial lineages.32 Sequence analyses
show that subunit D residues within the binding pocket are not conserved,
except P185, which is conserved across all bacterial species. Although
the residue variability in these positions could indicate that they
are not important for UQ binding, the data indicate that these residues
fulfill important roles, maintaining the pocket structure and confining
UQ to the catalytically relevant orientation in the binding site.

Role of Subunit D Residues in UQ Binding
Although most of these residues are not conserved in the NQR family,
their mutants show significant changes in the catalytic parameters,
as shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. In
all of these cases, a decrease in activity was found, as well as a
moderate increase in the Kiapp and a significant increase
in the resistance to the inhibitor HQNO. To understand the effects
of these changes, mutants P185G, L190A, and F193A (which produced
the more pronounced effects) were characterized. The most drastic
decline in activity occurred for mutant P185G, with a 5-fold decrease
in kcat as to that of the wild-type enzyme.
Interestingly, the KmUQ of this mutant has also the lowest
of all, and it required a small concentration of UQ to be fully active.
The decrease in kcat could be attributed
to the disruption of the structure of the enzyme, since proline is
a helix breaker. Alteration of the helix structure could cause a larger
change in the overall structure of the binding pocket or even the
entire complex, decreasing the activity. Alternatively, this decrease
in activity could be due to the binding of UQ in a location that is
close, but not in the UQ binding site. Molecular docking revealed
sharp differences between the mutants and wild type in how UQ binds
within the pocket (Figure 4). In the wild type, UQ binds deeply within the center of
subunits B and D with its ring in the direction of subunit D. For
P185G, UQ is located above the binding pocket and off-center, more
closely associating with subunit D. The decrease in the turnover rate
would also produce the observed decrease in Km, since this parameter
contains kcat in the denominator (k–1 + kcat/k1).

The mutants L190A and F193A
showed a 2-fold decrease in the kcat compared
to the wild-type enzyme and also had the two highest KmUQ values, 2–3 times greater than that of wild type. The results
suggest that these residues interact directly with the substrate in
the binding pocket and upon modification, higher concentrations of
the substrate are required. The results obtained from molecular docking
help to understand this behavior. The lowest energy pose for UQ in
the F193A mutant is located above the UQ pocket in a vertical orientation,
with the isoprenoid tail pointing downwards into the pocket, instead
of lying planar with respect to F185 and F211 residues in subunit
B, as is the case for the wild-type pose. The lowest energy pose of
the L190A mutant shows UQ above the binding site, which is not close
to that of the wild type at all; instead, it is inverted and rotated
to face subunit D. Even though L190 and L193 residues are not conserved,
in all cases found, these positions contain bulky aromatic and aliphatic
residues. These residues serve as the lid of the UQ binding site and
stabilize the substrate in the proper position that allow high electron
transfer rates. Once the lid is removed, by adding small residues
such as alanine, UQ is not properly oriented, and the small changes
observed in the distance between riboflavin and UQ could have a deep
effect on electron transfer. This difference could explain the lowered kcat and higher Km values obtained for these
mutants.

Role of Subunit D Residues
in Inhibitor Resistance
The mutants showed an increase in
the resistance to HQNO, in addition to the changes in the kinetic
parameters. In mutants P185G, L190A, and F193A, HQNO behaved as a
partial-mixed inhibitor vs UQ. These results differed greatly from
the wild-type enzyme, which has been shown to be inhibited by sub-micromolar
concentrations of HQNO with a mixed-type inhibition.27,32,36 Remarkably, under the partial-mixed
mechanism of inhibition, the enzyme is functional at saturating concentrations
of HQNO, and it is able to bind the substrate and inhibitor at the
same time.43 Molecular docking shows that
HQNO is bound deeply in the wild-type pocket. Analogous to what was
observed for UQ, in mutants L190A and F193A, HQNO is found in a different
orientation and appears rotated, explaining the increase in the Kiapp for the inhibitor. Moreover, in these mutants, we observed
that HQNO interacts more closely with subunit D, opening a space that
could accommodate the substrate and inhibitor. For P185G, HQNO appears
to bind in the same position as in wild type. As previously mentioned,
proline serves as a helix breaker and the disruption of this residue
could cause larger structural effects to the helix and probably in
the entire UQ binding pocket, which cannot be replicated by our docking
analysis even when the MD relaxation step is incorporated. It is likely
that major structural alterations caused by this mutation could cause
a decrease in catalytic activity and probably stabilize the interaction
with HQNO. In previous reports, it was proposed that the ion-pumping
mechanism of NQR is kinetically controlled, which supports a mechanism
in which the enzyme would undergo significant conformational changes.19,44 The crystallographic structure of NQR18 shows that several of the cofactors are separated by distances that
would not allow electron transfer at physiologically relevant rates,
further suggesting a conformationally driven mechanism. Our group
proposed a mechanism in which electron transfer through the cofactors
would elicit specific structural changes in the protein that would
allow sodium capture and release to the bacterial periplasm.27 In a recent report, we also proposed that the
UQ binding site that we found in the interface of subunits B and D
might not be in this physiologic state,32 since the protein was crystallized in the oxidized state and the
physiologically relevant state would be one of three five-electron
reduced forms.27 While the results obtained
by our group in this and in a previous work support that these residues
directly participate in the catalytic UQ binding site, we would like
to point out that the mutations could produce long-range effects that
could interfere with other steps, which, in a highly dynamic system
as NQR, might produce changes in a distant UQ site or other structures.
Another important aspect that supports the role of large conformational
changes in the mechanism of NQR is that the distance between many
cofactors, including riboflavin and the ubiquinone-binding site, is
too large to support electron transfer at physiologically relevant
rates. For instance, the distance between FMN in subunit B, the crystallographic
riboflavin, and the catalytic UQ binding site characterized in this
study, which comprises the last three electron carriers in the linear
pathway, is >30 Å. Thus, significant subunit reorganization
must occur during the catalytic process to bring cofactors together
and allow the redox reactions to proceed.

In a previous report
by our group, P. aeruginosa NQR (Pa-NQR)
was characterized.33 The results showed
that Pa-NQR possesses inhibition resistance to HQNO with a partial-mixed-type
inhibition.33 Our results showed that P. aeruginosa NQR contains mutations in residues
151 and 155, which confer significant resistance against HQNO (naturally
produced by P. aeruginosa). According
to the data found in this work (Table 1), these two positions are optimal to confer HQNO resistance,
since the mutants show partial inhibition with a significant HQNO-resistant
component, while maintaining some of the highest enzymatic activity.

Conclusions
The results
indicate that residues of the UQ binding site in subunit D play major
roles in catalytic UQ binding site, allowing the proper location and
orientation of UQ in the site. Moreover, these residues also play
roles in pocket structure and flexibility, and subtle changes in this
site can confer resistance against HQNO, which is naturally produced
by several types of bacteria,39,40 allowing the binding
of the substrate and inhibitor at the same time,33 which can be beneficial to avoid autopoisoning.

Materials and Methods
Plasmid Constructs
The mutations were obtained with a site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) using primers designed to mutate
residues of interest to alanine (or glycine in the case of the P185
residue), using the primers found in Table 3. Mutations were subcloned in-frame into
5′-KpnI and 3′-EcoRI restriction enzyme sites in an nqr-pBAD/HisB construct.27 Included
in the construct were a triplicate Gly repeat spacer and a six-histidine
sequence. Mutant nqr-pBAD/HisB plasmids were transformed
into V. cholerae O395 strain with a
deleted genomic nqr operon (Δnqr) for subsequent protein expression.27 All mutations were confirmed through DNA sequencing (Operon MWG).

Protein Expression and Purification
V. cholerae Δnqr cells carrying the pBAD plasmid containing wild-type or mutant NQR
operon were grown in Luria Broth media, as described previously by
Tuz et al.27 The expression of NQR was
induced using arabinose. Induced cells were harvested, washed, and
lysed via sonication (60 s pulsed sonication, 50% duty cycle). Cell
membranes were collected by differential centrifugation and solubilized
in buffer containing 0.3% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DDM), 5 mM imidazole, 50 mM Na2HPO4, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0. Protein purification was done
using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and DEAE-sepharose ion-exchange
chromatography.

Activity Measurements
UQ reductase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 282
nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 10.2 mM–1 cm–1.14,27 Enzyme activity assays
were performed in buffer containing 250 μM K2-NADH,
50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.05% DDM,
pH 8.0. Saturation kinetics were measured at varying concentrations
of UQ-1 (0–50 μM) and HQNO (0–10 μM).

To characterize the inhibition mechanism of HQNO, UQ-1 titration
experiments were performed at several fixed-variable concentrations
of HQNO. The data were fitted to the functions of competitive, uncompetitive,
and mixed-type inhibitions. However, the function that best described
the behavior is that of partial-mixed-type inhibition (eq 1),43 where v is the turnover rate, kcat is the turnover rate at saturating concentrations of the substrate
in the absence of the inhibitor, kcatR is the turnover rate obtained at saturating concentrations of the
substrate and inhibitor, [S] is the concentration of UQ, [I] is the
concentration of HQNO, Km is the Michaelis–Menten constant,
and Kicand Kiu are the inhibition constants of the competitive and uncompetitive
components43 1  

Molecular Docking
Molecular docking of HQNO and UQ-1 was performed with the wild-type
structure of V. cholerae NQR (1), and
in mutants P185G, L190A, and F193A. Mutations of these residues were
generated in UCSF Chimera (2). The interface of the BDE subunits,
where the UQ binding site is located, of these models was prepared
for UCSF DOCK 6.6 (3) by removing all hydrogen atoms with UCSF Chimera
1.9 (2). All models’ molecular surfaces were generated using
DMS from DOCK 6.6. Sphgen, another Dock 6.6 tool, was utilized to
generate vacancy spheres with a radius between 1.0 Å and 5.0
Å (3). The spheres were generated within a 36–36–36
Å box surrounding the BDE interface. Grid scores were used to
rank docked poses, with the lowest grid score corresponding to the
highest-ranked pose. The highest-ranked pose for both HQNO and UQ-1
from the wild-type docking was then transposed into the mutant structures,
and a grid score was calculated.
