In
this study, we investigated the effects of near supercritical
carbon dioxide (SCCO2) parameters, including pressure,
temperature, and saturation time on titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanopowder dispersion in water-containing sodium hexametaphosphate
(SHMP). The stability and morphology of TiO2 particles
dispersed in an aqueous solution were examined using a zeta potential
instrument, dynamic light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy.
As shown in the results, of particular interest, it was found that
near SCCO2’s pressure and saturation time had the
strongest impact on TiO2 dispersion in water-containing
SHMP. This finding indicated that TiO2’s secondary
average particle size was significantly reduced with an increase in
near SCCO2’s pressure and saturation time. Additionally,
in the presence of SHMP, the zeta potential of the as-prepared dispersion
solution reached −53.7 mV because of production of the larger
negative static charge repulsion force (resulting from SHMP dissociation)
on the TiO2 particle surface. The secondary average size
was 127 ± 68 nm, indicating good stability of TiO2 dispersed in water containing an inorganic dispersant.

1 Introduction
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been widely used for photocatalytic
coating,1,2 cosmetic,3 antibacterial,4 self-cleaning,5 and
biological6 purposes. Furthermore, TiO2’s smaller particle size has a specific surface area
effect,7 resulting in outstanding light
absorption, catalytic, and magnetic qualities. However, the small
particle size is easily agglomerated because of van der Waals forces,8 decreasing the stability of the TiO2 dispersion solution and making it difficult to detect the advantages
of the small particle size.9 Therefore,
the process to reduce the secondary average particle size and enhance
the stability of TiO2 dispersion solution is a very important
topic in application sectors.

Generally, the dispersion processes
involve three steps: wetting,
mechanical dispersion, and stability. In order to understand TiO2 dispersion in solution, it is essential to understand the
formation and properties of the solid–liquid interface. Dispersion
may be defined as a two-phase system, in which one is the dispersion
of the small particle phase and the other is the continued fluid phase.
Following particle wetting, a mechanical process, such as ultrasonic
dispersion,10 is usually required to complete
their separation. Typically, a mechanical method, such as a continuous
stirring recirculating media mill,11 is
applied to disperse the wetted particles into a separating unit. Ultrasonic
waves have also been proven as useful tools for dispersing nanoparticles
and eliminating agglomeration in aqueous suspensions.12 Ultrasonic irradiation generates shock waves by causing
cavitation collapse, leading to interparticle collisions. The agglomerated
particles thus become eroded and split by the collisions. Many studies
have applied ultrasonic wave to disperse TiO2 particles
in various solutions for application in different fields.13−18

Supercritical fluids (SCFs) are involved in numerous industrial
processes and have a potentially wide field of new applications.19 The SCF has both liquid- and gas-like properties,
so that it concurrently exhibits good diffusion and wettability. Additionally,
SCFs have lower surface tensions, resulting in faster permeations
than those seen with a liquid.20 As a result,
a SCF dispersion process was developed in order to separate the aggregated
particles. The supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) dispersing
method was first studied by Kamiwano et al.20 for dispersing carbon black particles in water without dispersants.
The results showed that the samples of 2 wt % carbon black were uniformly
dispersed throughout the solutions after standing for 100 h and had
a secondary average particle size of <5 μm. Cheng et al.21 used SCCO2 to disperse aminoanthraquinone
red, green 36, and blue 15:6 organic pigments in propylene glycol
monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) in which the organic pigment concentration
was 0.001 wt % in order to obtain secondary average particle sizes
of 178.5, 93.5, and 188.7, respectively, in the dispersion solution.
Wu et al.22 used SCCO2 to disperse
1 wt % violet 23 organic pigment in PGMEA. They found that under the
favorable conditions of 328.2 K and 20 MPa, the secondary average
particle size of pigment dispersion containing dispersants in PGMEA
was as small as 175 nm. Cheng and Wu23 studied
a cyclohexanone and PGMEA mixture as a binary solvent for assisting
SCCO2 dispersion and stabilizing organic nanoparticles
in the presence of a polyester/polyamine copolymer as a capping agent.
As shown in the results, a secondary average particle sizes of 59
and 64 nm were obtained for diketopyrrolopyrrole (red 254) and copper
phthalocyanine (green 36) organic pigments, respectively.

After
dispersing the wetted particles into a separated unit, sufficient
stability should be maintained for a long time for application purposes.
Many studies have focused on the TiO2 particle dispersion
stability in water. Mou et al.24 studied
the TiO2 dispersion solution’s solubility by adding
ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and sodium hexametaphosphate
(SHMP) as dispersants. The results showed that SHMP and tetrahydrofuran
as dispersants were the most stable ones. Almusallam et al.25 explored the stability of TiO2 particles
suspended in various aqueous solutions with and without salicylic
acid as an organic contaminant. They found that stable TiO2 dispersion solution could be obtained under basic solution conditions.
However, when changing the pH values of the solution from basic to
acidic, it was observed that TiO2 particles aggregated
at pH values below the isoelectric point.26 It was also shown that TiO2 aggregation was accelerated
by an increase in the concentration of particles in solution. Mahlalela
et al.27 examined the stability of the
dispersion solution by using different conducting liquids (deionized
water, NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2) in the various
solutions with different pH values. Agglomeration and zeta potentials
were influenced by ionic strength, electrolyte type, and the presence
of dyestuff. Tsai et al.28 investigated
SHMP and polyacrylic acid (PAA) dispersant effects on TiO2 dispersion stability. The results illustrated that the SHMP was
more stable than PAA for facilitating TiO2 dispersion in
water. In addition, ammonium polyacrylate (PAA-NH4) has
been investigated and compared with respect to the dispersion stabilities
of TiO2 powders with different particle sizes and surface
chemistries in aqueous suspensions containing a common water-based
dispersant.29

According to the studies
described in the literature, the present
study examined the use of near SCCO2 dispersing TiO2 nanopowder in water-containing SHMP as a dispersant, which
could be called as a green process because the used materials are
nontoxic chemicals. The effects of near SCCO2 conditions,
including pressure, temperature, and saturated time, on the stability
and morphology of TiO2 particles dispersed in aqueous solution
was examined by zeta potential instruments, a pH meter, dynamic light
scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ultraviolet–visible
absorption spectroscopy (UV–vis) associated with high-speed
centrifugation and natural sedimentation in this study.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Ratio of the Dispersant
to TiO2 and Effect of the pH Value on TiO2 Dispersion
Solution
Figure 1 shows that
the zeta potential of dispersed TiO2 in water varied with
different dispersant concentrations under specified conditions of
near SCCO2. As observed in the figure, when the ratio of
the dispersant is two times that of TiO2 in weight percentage,
the most stable dispersion solution exists because SHMP in water has
been dissociated into negatively charged phosphate ions and adsorbed
on the surface of TiO2 particles to form a perfect electrical
double layer. A small amount of inorganic dispersants cannot form
an effective electrical double layer on the surface of TiO2 particles, indicating that the electrostatic repulsion force is
small, which results in unstable TiO2 dispersion in the
solution; however, an excess amount of inorganic dispersants would
compress the electrical double layer on the surface of TiO2 particles leading to a low negative zeta potential. Therefore, the
weight ratio of the dispersant to TiO2 was determined as
2/1 in this study.

Figure 1 Zeta potential varying with concentration of the SHMP
dispersant
in 0.005 wt % TiO2 solution after being dispersed via SCCO2 under conditions of 35 °C, 1200 psi, and a saturation
time of 30 min, in which the residual CO2 in the TiO2 dispersion solution was removed with a ultrasonic bath for
10 min after depressurizing.

In addition, the effect of pH values on zeta potential and the
secondary average particle size estimated by DLS, for the dispersion
of 0.05 wt % TiO2 in solution with 0.1 wt % SHMP through
near SCCO2 under conditions of 35 °C, 1200 psi, and
a saturation time of 30 min, is shown in Figure 2. As seen in the figure, it was found that
the maximum negative zeta potential reached −53.7 mV at a pH
of 6.25, corresponding to a minimum secondary average particle size
of about 200 nm. This is because the acidic conditions cause TiOH2+ formation on the TiO2 particles’
surfaces; in the meantime, adsorption of phosphate ions occurs, resulting
in a decrease in the negative charge on particles’ surface.
In other words, with an increase in the pH value, the TiO– formation on the surface of TiO2 particles would couple
with the adsorbed phosphate ion to enhance negative charges on TiO2 particles’ surfaces, thus inducing dispersed solution
stabilization. The Na+ ion in the solution would also increase
and absorb the negative charge on the TiO2 surface, causing
a decrease in the electrical double layer thickness and resulting
in an unstable TiO2 dispersion solution.

and the secondary average particle size

water varying with the pH value of dispersion solution containing
0.01 wt % SHMP through SCCO2 under the conditions of 35
°C, 1200 psi, and a saturation time of 30 min.

2.2 Effects of Near SCCO2 Conditions
on Dispersion of TiO2 in Water
2.2.1 Temperature
In this study, we changed
the SCCO2 temperature in the dispersion process at a pressure
of 1200 psi and the saturation time of 30 min followed by CO2 removal in the dispersion solution using an ultrasonic bath for
10 min after depressurization. As seen in Figure 3, the temperature had a significant effect
on the secondary average particle size of the dispersed TiO2 in solution. As the temperature increased, the secondary average
particle size of TiO2 was decreased to 292 ± 4 nm
at 55 °C followed by an increase in particle size to 325 ±
16 nm at 65 °C, indicating that the temperature should be optimized
for TiO2 dispersion in water through near SCCO2. This process occurs because the elevated temperature can input
energy and disrupt van der Waals forces between the particles followed
by enhancement of particle mobility in the solution leading to formation
of smaller and more uniform secondary average particle sizes; in contrast,
an increase in temperature would reduce carbon dioxide solubility
in water,30 which would yield in weakening
of aggregated TiO2 particle dispersion by near SCCO2.

Figure 3 Secondary average particle size estimated from DLS of 0.005 wt
% TiO2 dispersion solution involving 0.01 wt % SHMP as
a function of temperature of SCCO2 under a pressure of
1200 psi and a saturation time of 30 min.

In order to further understand the temperature effects of near
SCCO2, we increased the TiO2 concentrations
in solution from 0.005 to 0.1 wt % in addition to selecting three
different temperatures: (1) 25; (2) 55; and (3) 65 °C. As estimated
from the TEM images shown in Figure 4, the secondary average particle sizes of dispersed
TiO2 in water by near SCCO2 were 210 ±
135, 184 ± 81, and 207 ± 153 nm at the temperatures of 25,
55, and 65 °C, respectively. This suggests that applying energy
to enhance separation of aggregated particles and solubility of near
SCCO2 in water would be traded for a smaller secondary
average particle size of dispersed TiO2 in solution.

(1) and particle size distribution (2) calculated from
TEM of dispersed 0.1 wt % TiO2 in water containing 0.2
wt % SHMP through SCCO2 under temperatures of (a) 25, (b)
55, and (c) 65 °C, respectively, as well as at a pressure of
1200 psi and a saturation time of 30 min. The inset is the morphology
of aggregated TiO2 particles in solution.

2.2.2 Pressure
At a temperature of 55
°C and a saturation time of 30 min, we changed the pressure of
near SCCO2 in the dispersion process followed by CO2 removal from the dispersion solution using an ultrasonic
bath for 10 min. As shown in Figure 5, with an increase in pressure from 1200 to 4000 psi,
the secondary average particle size was reduced from 292 ± 4
to 237 ± 6 nm as measured by DLS. It was indicated that higher
near SCCO2 pressure was favorable for the formation of
smaller TiO2 particles in solution. This process probably
occurs because an elevation in pressure leads to an increase in CO2 solubility in water, resulting in facilitating near SCCO2 penetration into the pores of aggregated particles in solution.
Additionally, Figure 6 shows the TEM of dispersed TiO2 particles in solution
under different near SCCO2 pressures. As exhibited in the
images, the secondary average particle size of thedispersed TiO2 particle decreases with increasing near SCCO2 pressure.
When the pressure was increased from 2000 to 4000 psi, the secondary
average particle size of dispersed TiO2 particle was reduced
from 165 ± 98 to 148 ± 68 nm. The standard deviation was
decreased, indicating that the narrow particle size distribution of
dispersed TiO2 in solution could be obtained by increasing
the pressure of near SCCO2.

size estimated from DLS of 0.005 wt
% TiO2 dispersion solution involving 0.01 wt % SHMP varying
with pressure of SCCO2 under a temperature of 55°C
and a saturation time of 30 min.

TEM of dispersed 0.1 wt % TiO2 in water containing 0.2
wt % SHMP through SCCO2 under pressures of (a) 2000, (b)
3000, and (c) 4000 psi, respectively, as well as at a temperature
of 55 °C and a saturation time of 30. The inset is the morphology
of aggregated TiO2 particles in solution.

2.2.3 Saturation Time
Figure 7 illustrates the effect of
near SCCO2 saturation time on the secondary average particle
size of dispersed TiO2 particles in water, in which CO2 pressure and temperature in addition to the time of CO2 removal from the dispersion solution after ultrasonication
were 4000 psi, 55 °C, and 10 min, respectively. As determined
from the figure, an increase in saturation time from 0 to 120 min
led to a reduction in the secondary average particle sizes of dispersed
TiO2 in solution from 418 ± 22 to 237 ± 9 nm
as determined by DLS. This finding indicated that more of the near
SCCO2 permeated the pores in-between TiO2 particles
as the saturation time increased, resulting in full wetting of aggregated
particles in solution. Meanwhile, we also found that the secondary
average particle size of TiO2 in solution would present
a constant trend when the saturation time of near SCCO2 reached 30 min, indicating that the agglomerated particle pores
were completely filled with near SCCO2. Figure 8 shows the TEM of dispersed
TiO2 in solution with near SCCO2 at different
saturation times. As observed from the figure, the secondary average
particle size of dispersed TiO2 in solution containing
near SCCO2 decreased with an increase in saturation time.
When the saturation time was increased from 5 to 120 min, the average
particle size of dispersed TiO2 particles in solution through
near SCCO2 was reduced from 201 ± 135 to 149 ±
65 nm as estimated by TEM.

DLS of 0.005 wt
% TiO2 dispersion solution involving 0.01 wt % SHMP varying

and a pressure of 4000 psi.

and (c) 120 min, respectively, as well as at a temperature of 55 °C
and a pressure of 4000 psi. The inset is the morphology of aggregated
TiO2 particles in solution.

2.3 Stability of TiO2 Dispersion Solution
The UV–vis light absorption associated with centrifugation
was used to examine stability of dispersed TiO2 in solution
without and with inorganic dispersants via near SCCO2 in
this study. Figure 9 presents the UV–vis light absorption spectra of four samples
before and after centrifugation at a rotational speed of 3000 rpm
for 30 min. As observed from Figure 9d, the UV–vis light absorption value of dispersed
TiO2 in water without dispersants by only magnetic stirring
for one day was the lowest because of aggregation seriously leading
to particle precipitation. The UV–vis light absorption spectra
of the sample dispersed by near SCCO2 in the absence of
dispersants is shown in Figure 9c, in which the absorption value was obviously higher than
the sample without dispersion by SCCO2, resulting from
TiO2 particles suspended in water stably.

Figure 9 UV–vis light absorption
spectra of 0.005 wt % TiO2 in water (a) with both 0.01
wt % SHMP and dispersion by SCCO2, (b) with 0.01 wt % SHMP
but without dispersion by SCCO2, (c) without SHMP but with
dispersion by SCCO2, and (d) without both SHMP and dispersion
by SCCO2. The
conditions of SCCO2 are a temperature of 55 °C, a
pressure of 4000 psi, and a saturation time of 30 min.

We further investigated the UV–vis light absorption
of TiO2 with and without dispersion by near SCCO2 in the
presence of SHMP. As shown in Figure 9a,b, the absorption peak was blue-shifted31 for the sample dispersion by near SCCO2, indicating that the secondary average particle size of dispersed
TiO2 in water was reduced in order to induce an absorption
peak shift to a shorter wavelength. This could be used to demonstrate
that the near SCCO2 is an effective method for TiO2 dispersion in water with inorganic dispersants.

Figure 10 shows
photographs of the natural sedimentation experiment in which sample
(a) was made from 0.1 wt % TiO2 in water; sample (b) was
prepared from blending 0.1 wt % TiO2 and 0.2 wt % SHMP
in water; sample (c) was fabricated by mixing 0.1 wt %TiO2 and 0.2 wt % SHMP and dispersed by near SCCO2; and sample
(d) was water for comparison, as well as the SCCO2 dispersion
conditions were 55 °C, 4000 psi, and 30 min saturation time.
As observed from the photographs, without inorganic dispersants in
water, the TiO2 particles had completely precipitated in
the bottom of the scintillation flask after dispersion for about one
day; on the other hand, adding SHMP could significantly enhance dispersed
TiO2 stability in solution, which clearly indicated that
the TiO2 dispersion solution with dispersants was more
stable than that without dispersants. This difference resulted from
smaller secondary average particle size of dispersed TiO2 in solution through near SCCO2 in the presence of dispersants.
The lifetime of dispersed TiO2 in water-containing SHMP
was over two weeks in this study.

3 Conclusions
In this study, near SCCO2 was successfully employed
to disperse TiO2 particles in water involving inorganic
dispersants. First, the amount of the SHMP dispersant was determined
by zeta potential analysis. The effects of different temperatures,
pressures, and saturation times on the dispersed TiO2 in
solution through near SCCO2 were then examined by DLS and
TEM. Finally, the stability of dispersed TiO2 in solution
was characterized via UV–vis light absorption associated with
centrifugation and natural sedimentation method. As shown in the results,
we summarize the study by highlighting several significant findings:(1) As the
addition of SHMP was twice
the concentration of TiO2 in weight, the maximum zeta potential
of the dispersion solution was −53.7 mV as measured by a zeta
potential instrument, suggesting that the SHMP as a dispersant was
well dissociated from the phosphate ions and adsorbed on the surface
of the TiO2 particles. This finding implied that TiO2 dispersion in solution had a large negative charge from the
electrostatic repulsive force and had good stability at a pH of 6.25
in order to prevent TiO2 particle precipitation under operating
conditions of near SCCO2.

(2) When the concentration of TiO2 in solution
with SHMP was 0.1 wt %, the secondary average
particle size was 366 ± 295 and 148 ± 68 nm as measured
by TEM before and after dispersion by near SCCO2, respectively,
indicating that near SCCO2 was validated as having penetrated
the pores of aggregated particles, and then rapidly depressurized
to effectively separate aggregated particles in solution.

(3) It was found that applying
energy
to promote separation of aggregated TiO2 particles and
solubility of CO2 in water should be compromised, namely,
the temperature of near SCCO2 must be optimized in this
work.

(4) Raising the pressure
could increase
the density of near SCCO2 in order to elevate wettability
of the near SCF on the surface of particles and enhance the separation
of aggregated TiO2 particles during the rapid depressurization
process.

(5) As analyzed
from DLS, when the concentration
of TiO2 ranged from 0.005 to 0.1 wt %, a 30 min SCCO2 saturation time was enough to completely wet the surface
of the aggregated particles.

(6) As measured by natural sedimentation,
the storage time of the as-prepared 0.1 wt % TiO2 dispersion
solution could be over two weeks.



Hopefully,
the above results promise to facilitate fabrication
of colloid inorganic oxide suspension through a green process.

4 Materials and Method
4.1 Chemicals
TiO2 powder
(P25) with a primary average particle size of 21 nm and a spherical
shape was purchased from Degussa. SHMP (99%) was used as an inorganic
surfactant (SHOWA) in order to enhance dispersion stability. Deionized
water (18.1 Ω), which was mechanically filtered and processed
to remove impurities, was used as a continuous phase. Hydrochloric
acid (32.4%) and sodium hydroxide (96%) were obtained from Choneye
Pure Chemicals and SHOWA, respectively. Both were diluted to 0.1 wt
% for adjusting the pH values of the dispersion solutions.

4.2 Determination of the Ratio of the Dispersant
to TiO2 in Dispersion Solution
In order to stabilize
the dispersed TiO2 and prevent it from precipitating in
water under near SCCO2 operating conditions, the experiments
were conducted by varying the amounts of SHMP from 0.0025 to 0.025
wt % (0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.015, and 0.025 wt %) in 50 mL deionized
water containing 0.005 wt % TiO2 with continuous magnetic
stirring (Ciamarec 2 Thermolyne, 950 rpm) for 24 h followed by transfering
to a 300 mL supercritical vessel through a peristaltic pump (Cole-Parmer
Masterflex L/S) at normal atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature.
A schematic diagram of the experimental system used in this study
is shown in Figure 11. For each experiment, the supercritical vessel was operated according
to the following procedure; after introducing 50 mL of the dispersion
solution, the supercritical vessel was closed, and the temperature
was controlled at 35 °C via a circulating water bath (Deng Yang
Water Bath D-606). The carbon dioxide concentration was then increased
up to 1200 psi in the supercritical vessel using an air driven pump
(Haskel ALG-60), followed by maintaining it at this pressure for 30
min, and then followed by rapid depressurization of the near SCCO2 to disperse the TiO2 particles in the solution.
In order to remove the residual carbon dioxide in the TiO2 dispersion solution after the near SCCO2 dispersion process,
an ultrasonic bath was used for 10 min before characterization. The
pH of the TiO2 dispersion solution was varied by addition
of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. In addition, a zeta potential
instrument (Malvern Zetasizer Nano Series) was used for measuring
the zeta potential of the TiO2 particles in the dispersion
solution after the pH was measured using a pH meter (SUNTEX SP-701).

4.3 Effects of Near SCF Conditions on TiO2 Dispersed in Water with the SHMP Dispersant
The
experimental samples were prepared by using 0.01 wt % SHMP in 50 mL
deionized water, followed by adding 0.005 wt % TiO2 with
continuous magnetic stirring for 24 h. The subsequent procedure was
similar to the dispersion method used in the previous experiment,
but the near SCCO2 dispersion temperature was varied from
25 to 65 °C, the pressure was regulated from 1200 to 4000 psi,
and the saturation time was limited between 0 and 120 min. We used
the same conditions and steps to disperse TiO2 in solution
in three separate experiments.

A DLS analyzer (Brookhaven 90Plus
Particle Sizer) was used for measuring the secondary average particle
size and dispersion solution distribution. For further validation,
the dispersed TiO2 particles in solution were characterized
by TEM (JEOL JEM-1200CX). The TEM images of dispersed TiO2 particles were analyzed with ImageJ.31

4.4 Stability of As-Dispersed TiO2 in
Water through Near SCCO2
The stability of the
dispersed TiO2 in solutions with and without dispersants
was evaluated by ultraviolet–visible absorption spectroscopy
(UV-1800 SHIMADZU) together with high-speed centrifugation (CN-3302
HSIANGTAI) in addition to natural sedimentation.
