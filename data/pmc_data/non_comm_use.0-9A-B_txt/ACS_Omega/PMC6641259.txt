It
has been demonstrated that atomic layer deposition (ALD) provides
an initially safeguarding, uniform ultrathin film of controllable
thickness for lithium-ion battery electrodes. In this work, CeO2 thin films were deposited to modify the surface of lithium-rich
Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (LRNMC) particles via ALD. The film thicknesses were
measured by transmission electron microscopy. For electrochemical
performance, ∼2.5 nm CeO2 film, deposited by 50
ALD cycles (50Ce), was found to have the optimal thickness. At a 1
C rate and 55 °C in a voltage range of 2.0−4.8 V, an initial
capacity of 199 mAh/g was achieved, which was 8% higher than that
of the uncoated (UC) LRNMC particles. Also, 60.2% of the initial capacity
was retained after 400 cycles of charge–discharge, compared
to 22% capacity retention of UC after only 180 cycles of charge–discharge.
A robust kinetic of electrochemical reaction was found on the CeO2-coated samples at 55 °C through electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy. The conductivity of 50Ce was observed to be around 3
times higher than that of UC at 60–140 °C. The function
of the CeO2 thin-film coating was interpreted as being
to increase substrate conductivity and to block the dissolution of
metal ions during the charge–discharge process.

Introduction
Lithium (Li)-rich layered
cathodes have been attracting great interest
due to their abundant Li storage and high energy density.1−5 Their composition is based on a layered structure, with layer–layer
integration of two components, LiMO2 (M = Mn, Ni, Co, etc.)
and Li2MnO3.3,6 Compared to
conventional cathode oxides, such as LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, and LiFePO4, the advantages of Li-rich
layered cathodes include sufficiently high initial capacity (>250
mAh/g), high operating voltage (3.5 V vs Li/Li+ on average,
up to 4.8 V), and low cost with less toxicity.7−9 However, some
drawbacks must be overcome before its commercial utilization, including
poor cyclic performance and voltage decay,7,10−12 limited rate capability resulting from low conductivity,
and the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer on
the cathode surface.2,13 During an initial charge to ∼4.5
V, an irreversible reaction of Li2MnO3 →
Li2O + MnO2 occurs, and Li+ extracted
from Li2MnO3 later reinserts into the electrochemically
active MnO2 phase to form a rocksalt LiMnO2 structure.1,10,14 An unstable LiMnO2 phase, however, will transfer to a spinel-like phase during repeated
charge–discharge cycles,2,14−19 and this will exaggerate the dissolution of transition-metal cations
and thicken the SEI layer,15,20,21 finally leading to further degradation of capacity.

Surface
modification has been demonstrated to protect the cathode
surface and achieve a better cycle lifetime, such as oxides (e.g.,
Al2O3,4 TiO2,22 MgO,21 Er2O3,23 SnO224), fluorides (e.g., CaF2,15,25 NH4F,11 AlF326,27), and phosphates (e.g., AlPO4,28 FePO429). Chen et al.24 reported that SnO2-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (LRNMC) showed increased cycling stability during 100 cycles
of charge–discharge at 600 mA/g and 60 °C. Wang et al.29 used amorphous FePO4 coating to improve
the capacity retention of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 from 84.9% of a pristine
sample to 95.0% during 100 cycles of charge–discharge at 100
mA/g and room temperature. Liquid-based methods were used for film
coatings in all previously mentioned reports. Surface-modified Li-rich
layered cathodes showed impressive capacity; however, most of the
studies were still within limited cycles of charge–discharge,
or only at room temperature, which are not enough to prove the protective
effect of coating during a long cycle range and under harsh conditions.
At an elevated temperature, the capacity of a Li-rich layered cathode
increased,12,22 but this was accompanied by worse
deterioration of capacity.22,30 Faced with the above-mentioned
challenges, an ionically and electronically conductive coating of
optimal thickness should be effective in protecting the surfaces of
the cathode particles.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been
demonstrated to be a promising
technique for the enhancement of cyclic performance of Li-ion batteries.30−34 Different from conventional coating methods, ALD can provide precise
control of film thicknesses, which is extremely helpful in identifying
an optimal thickness. According to our previous work, a CeO2 ALD coating of optimal thickness successfully solved the trade-off
between capacity and cyclic stability for spinel cathodes.31,33 Surface modification of Li(Li0.17Ni0.2Co0.05Mn0.58)O2 by CeO2 nanoparticles
was adopted in other works, but the coating was not conformal and
the cyclic number and test at only room temperature were not sufficient
to show significant enhancement of cyclic stability.35 In a previous work, Al2O3 ALD-coated
Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 was demonstrated to deliver a higher capacity retention,
but lower specific capacity; TiO2 ALD coating increased
the capacity of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, but without any mitigation of capacity
loss.30 Herein, ultrathin CeO2 films of different thicknesses were deposited on the surface of
Li-rich Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 primary particles by ALD. CeO2 coating of
50 cycles was found to be the optimal thickness for the highest improvement
in capacity (∼199 mAh/g) and a ∼60.2% capacity retention,
even after 400 cycles of charge–discharge in a voltage range
of 2.0−4.8 V at a 1 C rate and 55 °C. This film acted
as a conductive barrier to prevent metal dissolution and to lower
resistivity of the substrate.

Results and Discussion
Characterization
The pristine Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles,
as shown in Figure 1, were polydispersed spherical and porous particles, with diameters
of 1–3 μm, which were confirmed by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and found to be consistent with the previously reported
work.30,36 In Figure S1,
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine LRNMC particles also
confirmed the consistency with previous work.36

Figure 1 SEM
image of pristine LRNMC particles before ALD.

Various cycles of CeO2 ALD were deposited on the
surface
of LRNMC particles, including 30, 50, 70, and 100 cycles (named as
30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce, respectively). The purpose was to acquire
CeO2 coatings of different thicknesses because there was
a trade-off to solve by controlling the film thickness. Figure 2a shows a transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) image of part of one uncoated (UC) particle, and
the edges defined by equidistant fringes can be observed as the smooth
surface of the layered cathode. In Figure 2b, an amorphous and conformal layer deposited
by 50 cycles of CeO2 ALD appeared on the particle surface,
which can be defined by the crystal structure of LRNMC. The thickness
of the film was observed to be ∼2.5 nm. In our previous work,31 with 50 cycles of CeO2 ALD, the film
thickness was 2.5–3 nm, and with 100 cycles of CeO2 ALD, the film thickness was ∼5 nm. The growth rate of CeO2 ALD film was found to be constant. In this work, the film
thicknesses were consistent with our previous measurements.31,33 In addition, surface areas of the UC and 100Ce samples were measured
as 7.2 and 7.6 m2/g, respectively, which indicated that
CeO2 ALD coating did not affect the surface areas of the
LRNMC particles.

Electrochemical Analysis
During galvanostatic charge
and discharge, all coin cells were tested in a wide voltage range
of 2.0–4.8 V. Initial charge–discharge at a 0.05 C (1
C = 250 mA/g) rate and room temperature was performed, as shown in Figure S2. The UC delivered ∼275 mAh/g
discharge capacity after the activation of Li2MnO3 in the first charge. Slight increases in the discharge capacity
of 30Ce, 50Ce, and 70Ce were observed, which were ∼280, ∼284,
and ∼279 mAh/g, respectively. This could be attributed to the
improvement in conductivity of LRNMC particles by CeO2 coating.
However, the discharge capacity of 100Ce was ∼271 mAh/g, suggesting
that the capacity would be lowered if the coating film was too thick.
Coulombic efficiencies exhibited ∼83.3, ∼83.8, ∼83.3,
∼83.5, and ∼83.1% for UC, 30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce
during the initial charge–discharge cycle. These results did
not show obvious differences, indicating that the coating material
did not affect the activation of Li2MnO3. On
the other hand, these results also ensured their consistency with
the results of previous work.30 In Figure 3, the rate capabilities
of UC, 30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce were explored at different C rates
(0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C). At room temperature (Figure 3a), 30Ce, 50Ce, and 70Ce showed
initial discharge capacities of ∼250, ∼261, and ∼257
mAh/g at a 0.1 C rate, respectively, which were higher than ∼246
mAh/g of UC and ∼242 mAh/g of 100Ce. This improvement should
be attributed to the better conductivity of the CeO2-coated
particles. However, a thicker film would intensify the polarization
behavior, as the initial capacity of 100Ce was lower than that of
the UC sample. For 30Ce, there was only an increase of ∼4 mAh/g,
compared to that of the UC, due to the inadequate thickness of the
ionically conductive CeO2 film. At a 2 C rate, 50Ce delivered
an ∼130 mAh/g capacity, which was still the highest, compared
to only ∼111 mAh/g for the UC. In Figure S3a, the normalized discharge capacity of Figure 3a is plotted against the discharge
capacity at a 0.1 C rate. At a 2 C rate, 50Ce had a capacity that
was 50% of the capacity at a 0.1 C rate, but only ∼45% for
UC. After the current density returned to 0.1 C, a good reversible
capacity was observed for both uncoated and coated samples.

Figure 3 Galvanostatic
discharge capacities of coin cells made of UC and
different cycles of CeO2 ALD-coated LRNMC particles at
different C rates (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 C) in the voltage range
of 2.0–4.8 V at (a) room temperature and (b) 55 °C.

In Figure 3b, the
initial capacities of all samples increased at 55 °C because
the conductivity of LRNMC had been enhanced at elevated temperatures,
which agreed with other works.12,22,30 At a 0.1 C rate, the 50Ce delivered a higher capacity of ∼270
mAh/g than the ∼255 mAh/g average for the UC. It is worth pointing
out that the 100Ce showed an increase of ∼18 mAh/g over the
initial capacity at room temperature. Even though the coating was
thick, 100Ce seemed to benefit more from a higher temperature than
the other coated samples did. Further discussion will be continued
as a part of impedance analysis. In Figure S3b, the normalized discharge capacities of coated samples at 55 °C
also exhibited improvement in rate capability over those at room temperature.
For a 2C rate, the highest increase of ∼5.8% in capacity was
observed for 50Ce, but a ∼5% decrease occurred for UC. As the
temperature increased, the decomposition of electrolyte at high voltage
and hydrogen exchange could have been more frequent and aggravated
a hydrogen fluoride (HF) attack. After coin cells were cycled again,
at a 0.1 C rate, the reversibility of the initial capacity of UC was
not as good as that at room temperature. On the contrary, the reversible
capacity was ∼100% for 50Ce and 70Ce because the CeO2 coating was not only protective and prevented the formation of an
insulating SEI layer, but also conductive and assisted the charge
transfer.

To further investigate and determine the cyclic performance,
different
coin cells were employed to conduct the galvanostatic cycling test
at 1 or 2 C rates. As shown in Figure 4a, for a 1 C rate at room temperature, the initial
capacity of 50Ce delivered the highest capacity of ∼166 mAh/g,
which was ∼8% higher than the ∼153 mAh/g of UC. The
initial capacity of 100Ce was ∼109 mAh/g, but its stable value
raised to ∼146 mAh/g because a CeO2 film of 100
cycles of CeO2 ALD was too thick. The same phenomena were
also observed in other works using Al2O3 ALD
coating.37,38 As the charge–discharge cycle proceeded,
the capacity of the UC gradually faded and, after 100 cycles, only
∼90 mAh/g were retained. This was ∼58.2% of the initial
discharge capacity. The capacity retention rates (with respect to
∼146 mAh/g) of coated LRNMC were ∼92, ∼94.6,
∼93.1, and 95.3% for 30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce after 100
cycles of charge–discharge, respectively. In Figure S4, the voltage−capacity curves of UC and 50Ce
also showed obvious improvement in capacity retention by CeO2 ALD coating. A remarkable enhancement of cyclic performance was
also observed at a 2 C rate (Figure 4b). The initial capacities showed a small increase
of 50Ce, compared to UC, whereas in terms of capacity retention (after
100 cycles of charge–discharge), ∼64.3% of UC was in
marked contrast to ∼92.4% of 50Ce and 93.3% of 70Ce. In addition,
in this work, capacity retention was favored by a higher C rate at
room temperature, which agreed well with another work.39 This suggested that transition-metal ions remain
at higher oxidation states due to less Li+ insertion at
higher C rates, thereby alleviating Jahn–Teller distortion.39

Figure 4 Galvanostatic discharge capacities of coin cells made
of UC and
different cycles of CeO2 ALD-coated LRNMC particles at
(a) 1 C and (b) 2 C rates in a voltage range of 2.0–4.8 V at
room temperature.

A comprehensive study
of the benefits of CeO2 ALD coating
also involved a cycling test at 55 °C, as shown in Figure 5. At a 1 C rate (Figure 5a), 50Ce delivered ∼199
mAh/g capacity in the first cycle, which was ∼8% higher than
∼184 mAh/g of UC. The initial capacities of 30Ce, 70Ce, and
100Ce were ∼173, ∼188, and ∼150 mAh/g, respectively.
If we consider the increment of capacity at an elevated temperature,
notably, 100Ce showed a larger capacity increment (i.e., ∼37.6%)
than ∼19.8% for 50Ce. The capacity of 100Ce increased to 160
mAh/g after only two cycles of charge and discharge, which was shorter
at 55 °C than that at room temperature. This may imply that the
kinetic of electrochemical reaction that occurred on the surface of
coated samples had been favored at a higher temperature. After 100
cycles of charge–discharge, there was only 42.3% of the initial
capacity remaining for UC, suggesting that higher temperature also
exacerbated capacity degradation. Accordingly, temperature should
simultaneously improve the activity of both electrochemical reactions
and side reactions at the electrode–electrolyte interface so
that side products (e.g., HF) will intensify their attack on the surface
of the electrode.40 Under the same conditions,
50Ce appeared to scavenge HF and to significantly improve cyclic stability,
with a capacity retention of 94.3% after 100 cycles. A previous study
indicated that MgO-coated LRNMC, prepared by the melting impregnation
method, exhibited 94.3% capacity retention after 50 cycles at 200
mA/g and 60 °C, but the specific capacity of LRNMC was lowered
by MgO due to its insulating feature.21 Similarly, at a 2 C rate (as shown in Figure 5b), the protection of CeO2 coating
contributed to a higher capacity retention. For UC, 30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce,
and 100Ce, after 100 cycles, the capacity retentions were ∼36.7,
∼84.8, ∼86.6, ∼85.2, and ∼90.8%, respectively.
Chen et al. modified the surface of LRNMC by SnO2, and
the coated sample delivered only 68% capacity retention after 100
cycles of charge−discharge at 600 mA/g and 60 °C.24 The thicker CeO2 coating of 100Ce
showed its exceptional safeguard stability, but the initial capacity
was only ∼116 mAh/g at a 2 C rate, compared to ∼156
mAh/g for 50Ce, indicating that 100 cycles of CeO2 ALD
were too thick. In other words, 50Ce would be the optimal thickness
for addressing the trade-off between protection and the transport
barrier.

Figure 5 Galvanostatic discharge capacities of coin cells made of UC and
different cycles of CeO2 ALD-coated LRNMC particles at
(a) 1 C and (b) 2 C rates in a voltage range of 2.0–4.8 V at
55 °C.

To further understand
the function of a CeO2 coating,
deeper charge–discharge cycling tests of UC and 50Ce were conducted
at a 1 C rate and 55 °C. As shown in Figure 6a, after 180 cycles, UC was found to maintain
only ∼22% of its initial capacity. In contrast, with promotion
of 50Ce, the reversible capacity was ∼60.2% of its initial
capacity, even after 400 cycles of charge–discharge. In our
previous reports,31,33 the cycling life of LiMn2O4 and LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 had been significantly extended to 1000 cycles through ALD
coating of CeO2. In view of this, we separated the discharge
capacities in Figure 6a into two parts, “>3.1 V” and “<3.1 V”,
to correspond to each working potential of layered (above 3.1 V) and
spinel (below 3.1 V),5,12,39 to investigate and determine the capacity degradation of the UC
and 50Ce. As shown in Figure 6b, capacity was dominantly provided by a spinel structure
formed during continuous cycles that were working below ∼3.1
V (also see Figure 6d). The capacities provided by a layered structure kept decreasing,
whether for the UC from ∼102 to ∼12 mAh/g in 180 cycles
or for 50Ce from ∼126 to ∼32 mAh/g in 400 cycles. It
should be related to the structure transition from the layered to
a spinel-like phase in LRNMC during its repeated charge–discharge
cycling.15,16,19 Accompanied
by the migration of transition-metal cation into Li vacant sites,12,19,41 the working voltage inevitably
decayed. Nevertheless, substituting a spinel-like structure continued
to supply a host matrix for Li+ insertion and disinsertion;
thus, it was observed that the capacity of 50Ce increased from ∼73
to ∼120 mAh/g for the <3.1 V section. In Figure 6c, discharge voltage profiles
were plotted as power-weighted average voltage versus cycle number,
as presented elsewhere.42 The voltage profiles
of 50Ce showed ∼0.25 V decrease after 150 cycles of charge–discharge,
and a slower decrease trend was observed after about 150 cycles of
charge–discharge, which also corresponded to the trend of its
capacity increase for the <3.1 V section. After 150 cycles, the
power-weighted average voltage of the UC decreased by ∼0.31
V, from ∼3.21 to ∼2.90 V, indicating the loss of both
layered and spinel structures. CeO2 film prevented metal
dissolution, and the capacity was largely retained, even at a high
temperature. Without suppression by a CeO2 coating, the
UC suffered from severe dissolution of host cation and thus the capacity
of both >3.1 and <3.1 V parts significantly dropped.

of UC and 50Ce from 1st to 100th charge–discharge cycle at

To shed light on the impact of CeO2 ALD
coating, coin
cells tested at a 1 C rate were characterized by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) before and after their cycling tests at room temperature
and 55 °C. All of the EIS data were collected at an open-circuit
voltage (OCV) of coin cells when they were fully discharged. Impedance
spectroscopy was carried out by applying alternating current (AC)
with logarithmically decreasing frequency (from 1 MHz to 1 mHz). In
a typical Nyquist plot, the valuable information involves ohmic resistance
(RΩ), the first intersection between
curve and real axis (Z′ axis), film impedance
(Rf/CPEf), the first semicircle,
charge-transfer impedance (Rct/CPEct), the second semicircle, and Warburg impedance (Ws), the “tail”.43 CPE stands for a constant phase element that is typically
explained as double-layer capacitance. Cyclic performance largely
depends on the polarization behavior of the electrodes, which can
be represented by the sum of Rf and Rct. Separately, Rf characterizes resistance of the surface layers, including a deposited
coating and an SEI layer; Rct reflects
charge-transfer resistance, suggesting the activity of electrochemical
reactions; and the Warburg element stands for mass-transfer resistance
for Li+ from the particle surface toward its center.43 The model in Figure 7c was applied to fit the collected data and
obtain the quantified results listed in Tables 1 and 2. Typically,
it really portrays the kinetic inside of the coin cells, but it is
still an assumed model without critical physical meaning. The CeO2 coating aimed to control the thickening of the SEI layer,
while preventing dissolution of cation and increasing conductivity.44

In Figure 7a, EIS
was carried out at room temperature after the initial formation of
the coin cells. Rf of the coated LRNMC
was positively correlated as an increase in the thickness of the coating,
whereas the UC had a higher Rf, indicating
that a thicker SEI layer had formed on the surface of the uncoated
LRNMC after its formation. For charge-transfer resistance, Rct of the UC was extraordinarily higher than
that of the coated samples, 1289 Ω compared to 480, 351, 454,
and 796 Ω for 30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce, respectively. Therefore,
50Ce had shown the highest activity of electrochemical reaction among
all of the samples. In light of Warburg impedance, mass transfer was
also favored by the CeO2 coating. Nevertheless, because
30Ce was not thick enough and provided a higher mass-transfer resistance,
it had a lower initial capacity than that of the 50Ce during the cycling
test. Besides, most samples had an overlap between Rct and Ws after 100 cycles
of charge and discharge, except 50Ce, which showed an apparent “tail”
due to its lowest Rct. After 100 charge–discharge
cycles, RΩ and Rf of 30Ce, 50Ce, and 70Ce changed slightly due to protection
at the surface, but 100Ce exhibited a higher increase for RΩ (2.3 Ω) and Rf (20.5 Ω). For the UC, Rf increased by 61.2 Ω, which could be attributed to thickening
of the SEI layer. Polarization behavior was clearly pictured as the
sum of Rf and Rct (Figure 7d), where
50Ce showed the smallest sum due to its lower Rct for 351 Ω and supported its highest initial capacity
at a 1 C rate. Lower charge-transfer resistance will benefit the formation
of an ordered spinel structure and thus enhance the rate capability
and capacity retention.11,15,45

In Figure 8a, EIS
was carried out at 55 °C after formation of coin cells. Compared
to resistances at room temperature, samples showed lower values of Rf, Rct, and Ws. At the elevated temperature, higher conductivity
and more facile mass transfer led to capacity increase. For the same
reason, Rct also decreased considerably
for 30Ce, 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce, which were, respectively, 137, 85,
129, and 167 Ω. The Ws values of
coated LRNMC at 55 °C were all around 30 Ω, which was lower
than 50 Ω at room temperature. However, the formation of the
SEI layer at a higher temperature was caused by intensified HF attack
and cation dissolution.31 Thus, the UC
showed ∼604 Ω increase of Rf after 100 cycles of charge–discharge, which differed from
the small changes in the coated samples. On the other hand, Rct of the UC increased ∼1084 Ω
at 55 °C and was much higher than that of the coated samples.
This also explained the low capacity retention of UC at 55 °C.
Notwithstanding that side reactions became worse at higher temperatures,
with the CeO2 coating protection, a robust kinetic of electrochemical
reaction should be helpful in the formation of an ordering spinel
phase.11,15,45 In Figure 8c, the lower sum
of Rf and Rct for the coated samples than that for the UC indicated that CeO2 coating can make LRNMC take full advantage of the augmented
capacity at a higher temperature by hindering the worse degradation
caused by elevated temperatures. In this case, 50Ce exhibited the
lowest resistances of 248.7 and 548.2 Ω before and after cycling
tests, respectively, indicating again the optimal thickness for enhancement
of the cyclic performance of LRNMC by 50 cycles of CeO2 ALD coating.

cycle, and (c) summation of fitted parameters, Rf and Rct, at 0th cycle (left)
and 100th cycle (right). The inset figure shows impedance spectra
at high-frequency regions.

Impedance spectra on particles themselves were measured to
understand
the function of CeO2 coating and to estimate conductivity.
All samples were made into pellets and characterized by EIS and chronoamperometry
(CA). Before the conductivity measurement, XRD was carried out for
the pre- and post-annealed samples to make certain that high-temperature
annealing did not affect the substrate itself (as shown in Figure S1). The AC impedance spectra (Figure S5) were analyzed using a distinctive
equivalent circuit model from coin cell analysis, as shown in Figure 9b. CPE1 represents the capacitance of geometric configuration between two
electronically conducting Ag electrodes. Parallel elements are a series
of R & CPE2 for resistance of the
pellet and double-layer capacitance.46 The
conductivity was calculated based on measured resistance R, thickness, and the area of each pellet. In Figure 9a, Arrhenius plots are based on the following
equation 1  where σ denotes electronic conductivity, A0 is the pre-exponential factor, and Ea means activation energy. The conductivity
was observed to increase as temperature increased, which was consistent
with the cyclic performance of coin cells during cycling tests. Higher
conductivity benefits the kinetic of electrochemical reactions and
thus coin cells exhibited a lower charge-transfer resistance (Figures 7a and 8a). Also, CeO2 coating of 30Ce, 50Ce, and 70Ce
increased the conductivity of LRNMC particles ∼3 times, compared
to that of UC. But the resistance of 100Ce was higher than that of
the other coated samples. This behavior can be attributed to the fact
that the CeO2 ALD film of 100 cycles was too thick and
the delayed transportation process at the interface increased the
charge-transfer resistance. Above 100 °C, the conductivities
of 30Ce, 50Ce, and 70Ce almost coincided, which was different from
the findings in our previous works, where CeO2 ALD films
were deposited on the spinel.31,33 However, as the temperature
dropped to below 100 °C, there was a small deviation among 30Ce,
50Ce, and 70Ce; clearly, 50Ce showed the highest conductivity below
100 °C. In light of this trend, we believed that the conductivity
of 50Ce should be higher than those of the other samples at lower
temperatures; hence, this benefits its cyclic performance so that
it was better than that of 30Ce and 70Ce.

conductivities of pellets made of UC and

impedance spectra of pellets.

In Figure 10, SEM
was carried out on both UC and 50Ce cathodes after 400 cycles of charge–discharge
at a 1 C rate and 55 °C. The SEM image of UC in Figure 10a shows severe exfoliation
and breakup of UC particles in the cathode, which should be the reason
for the irreversible loss of its capacity. However, in Figure 10b, 50Ce still mostly maintained
its original spherical shape. These results indicated that a CeO2 coating can effectively scavenge HF to mitigate side reactions
with electrolyte and protect the structure of cathode particles.

Conclusions
The layered structure
of LRNMC acquires a good stabilization and
excess Li supplement through being composited with the Li2MnO3 phase; however, it is also affected by the insulating
feature of Li2MnO3. The phase transition and
metal dissolution cause further degradation of capacity. Hence, in
this work, we modified the surface of Li-rich layered cathode Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 by CeO2 ALD coating to increase the substrate
conductivity and set a barrier for metal dissolution. The optimal
CeO2 film thickness was ∼2.5 nm, deposited by 50
cycles of CeO2 ALD. With the optimal thickness of a CeO2 coating, there was ∼8% of initial capacity increase
at both room temperature and 55 °C; the cyclic stability of LRNMC
improved to ∼60.2% capacity retention after 400 cycles of charge–discharge
in a voltage range of 2.0−4.8 V at a 1 C rate and 55 °C.
Overall, CeO2 ALD coating is an effective way to promote
the electrochemical performance of cathode particles because of its
safeguarding and conductive nature.

Experimental Section
CeO2 ALD Coating
A series of different thicknesses
of CeO2 films were coated on the LRNMC particles by ALD
in a fluidized bed reactor (illustrated in detail elsewhere).47 The LRNMC particles were prepared using a spray
pyrolysis process, previously described in detail.30,36 Tris(i-propylcyclopentadienyl)cerium (Ce(iPrCp)3) (99.9%, Strem Chemicals) and deionized
water were used as precursors for CeO2 ALD. A typical coating
cycle consisted of Ce(iPrCp)3 dose, N2 flush, H2O dose, and N2 flush. CeO2 ALD was carried out at 250 °C. Ce(iPrCp)3 was heated in a feed bubbler at ∼140 °C,
and N2 was used as carrier gas for Ce(iPrCp)3. All feed lines were maintained at the same temperature
to avoid condensation of the precursors. The ALD process was controlled
through LABVIEW program. CeO2 ALD of 30, 50, 70, and 100
cycles was applied to obtain different thicknesses, and named as UC
(uncoated samples), 30Ce (30 cycles of CeO2 ALD-coated
LRNMC particles), 50Ce, 70Ce, and 100Ce, respectively.

Coin Cell Assembly
The cathode slurry was prepared
by mixing 80 wt % LRNMC particles, 10 wt % Super P carbon black (Alfa
Aesar), and 10 wt % poly(vinylidene fluoride) (Sigma-Aldrich) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma-Aldrich) solvent. The slurry
was uniformly cast on aluminum foil using a doctor blade (MTI Corp.).
The coated foil was then dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C overnight.
After acquiring the dry coated foil, a working electrode was punched
into a round disk with a diameter of ∼0.95 cm, loaded with
a mass of ∼2.4 mg/cm2 of active materials. Assembly
of CR2032 coin cells was finished in an Ar-filled glovebox. Li metal
(99.9% trace-metal basis, Sigma-Aldrich) served as the counter electrode,
with separator Celgard 2325 between electrodes. The electrolyte was
1 mol/L LiPF6 solution (Sigma-Aldrich) with a mixed solvent
of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate with a volume ratio of
1:1.

Characterization
A Quantachrome Autosorb-1 was used
to obtain nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms of the UC and
100Ce samples at −196 °C. The surface area of the particles
was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method
in a relative pressure range of 0.05–0.25. The UC and 50Ce
samples were visualized with an FEI Tecnai F20 field emission gun
high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Film thickness was
measured on the basis of TEM images. Morphology of pristine LRNMC
particles was visualized using a Hitachi S-4700 field emission scanning
electrode microscope. UC and 50Ce coin cells were dissembled after
a galvanostatic charge–discharge test at a 1 C rate at 55 °C,
and their cathodes were investigated by the same SEM equipment. To
ensure that most of the parts of each sample was studied (rather than
just a localized area), adequate and equal amounts of time were spent
on SEM analysis of all samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried
out on a Phillips powder diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation
and λ = 1.5406 Å, at a scan rate of 2°/min and step
size of 0.2°.

Electrochemical Analysis
The galvanostatic
cycling
test was carried out on a battery test station (Neware Corp.) in the
voltage range of 2.0–4.8 V at different temperatures (room
temperature and 55 °C). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) measurement was carried out using a Biologic impedance analyzer
in a frequency range of 1 mHz to 1 MHz with an excitation signal of
10 mV at different temperatures (room temperature and 55 °C).
The consistency of open-circuit voltage (OCV) of every tested coin
cell was checked to confirm the validity of the EIS data. Conductivity
measurement was performed using the same analyzer on active materials
at different temperatures (60, 80, 100, 110, 120, 130, and 140 °C).
Each sample was first cold-pressed into a round pellet with a diameter
of ∼1.3 cm and thickness of ∼0.1 cm and then annealed
at 800 °C for 24 h to solidify them. Meanwhile, pristine LRNMC
particles were characterized by XRD before and after their annealing
operation to make sure that the annealing process would not affect
the original structure of LRNMC particles. After that, both sides
of the pellets were coated with Ag paste (Sigma-Aldrich), which acted
as a blocking electrode. Before measurement, the Ag-coated pellets
were dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 1 h. The AC conductivity
measurement was performed on pellets using EIS in the frequency range
of 1 mHz to 1 MHz with an excitation signal of 50 mV. Then, direct
current (DC) conductivity measurement was performed on the same pellets
using chronoamperometry (CA) at different voltages of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0,
1.25, and 1.5 V.
