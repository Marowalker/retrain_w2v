Constructing
sensor systems for rapid and selective detection of
small biomolecules such as amino acids is a major area of focus in
bioanalytical chemistry. Considering the biological relevance of arginine
and lysine, significant efforts have been directed to develop fluorescent
sensors for their detection. However, these developed sensors suffer
from certain disadvantages such as poor aqueous solubility, technically
demanding and time-consuming synthetic protocols, and more importantly,
most of them operate through single wavelength measurements, making
their performance prone to small variations in experimental conditions.
Herein, we report a ratiometric sensor that operates through lysine-
and arginine-induced dissociation of a supramolecular assembly consisting
of emissive H-aggregates of a molecular rotor dye, thioflavin-T (ThT),
on the surface of a polyanionic supramolecular host, sulfated β-cyclodextrin.
This disassembly brings out the modulation of monomer–aggregate
equilibrium in the system which acts as an ideal scheme for the ratiometric
detection of lysine and arginine in the aqueous solution. Besides
facile framework of our sensor system, it employs a commercially available
inexpensive probe molecule, ThT, which provides an added advantage
over other sensor systems that employ synthetically demanding probe
molecules. Importantly, the distinctive feature of the ratiometric
detection of arginine and lysine provides an inherent advantage of
increased accuracy in quantitative analysis. Interestingly, we have
also demonstrated that arginine displays a multiwavelength distinctive
recognition pattern which distinguishes it from lysine, using a single
supramolecular ensemble. Furthermore, our sensor system also shows
response in heterogeneous, biologically complex media of serum samples,
thus extending its possible use in real-life applications.

1 Introduction
The
inevitable importance of amino acids in diverse fields such
as human metabolism,1 nutrition analysis,1,2 and clinical diagnosis of diseases,3,4 has triggered
a large activity in designing molecular sensors for detection of amino
acids.5,6 Some of the common analytical methods that
have been developed to detect and characterize amino acids include
chromatography,7,8 electrochemistry,6,9 colorimetry,10,11 fluorimetry,2,12−14 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,15 and so forth, among which fluorescent sensors
have attracted significant attention.12,14 The exceptional
features of fluorimetric sensors such as quick response, high sensitivity,
and selectivity have enabled their wide adoption as a method of choice
for devising sensors.2,12,16,17 Although numerous sensors for the detection
of thiol containing amino acids have been commonly described, there
are only few reports which aim to detect other biologically relevant
amino acids.18−20

Among the proteic amino acids, arginine and
lysine are classified
as basic amino acids, which are pivotal for the proper functioning
of biological systems. Arginine, for instance, is involved in various
biological processes such as cell division, wound healing, immune
functions, and release of hormones.10,21−23 Arginine also acts as a precursor for nitric oxide, which is a crucial
physiological mediator.1,24 On the other hand, the physiological
levels of lysine in the body is important for the regulated metabolic
function. High levels of lysine in plasma or urine manifest into various
clinical conditions. For example, high lysine concentration in plasma
and urine indicates congenital metabolic disorders such as cystinuria
or hyperlysinemia.1,25−27 Thus, it is
of paramount importance to develop fluorescent sensors with a high
sensitivity and selectivity for basic amino acids.

The conventional
fluorescence sensors are most frequently associated
with the design and synthesis of specialized probe for the selective
detection of amino acids, which needs sophisticated and time-consuming
synthesis steps to obtain the probe molecule. Most often, Their usage
is limited to nonaqueous medium owing to their poor water solubility,28 and more importantly, most of them operate through
their response at single wavelength which makes their performance
highly prone to small variations under experimental conditions such
as probe molecule concentration, fluctuations in light intensity,
and so forth.29−32 Thus, there is a need to adopt an alternative strategy to design
a ratiometric fluorescence sensor of optimum sensitivity and selectivity
with a simple design that can operate in aqueous media.

One
such alternative and attractive strategy that has emerged to
be quite promising in the field of analytical chemistry is the usage
of supramolecular assemblies as sensing ensembles. The current focus
and interest in using supramolecular assemblies as sensory ensembles
over conventional fluorescent sensors arise owing to certain distinctive
features of these supramolecular assemblies. Supramolecular hosts,
in combination with fluorescent dyes, operate via the dynamic and
reversible noncovalent interactions, which aids in easy manipulation
of these assemblies, when subjected to interaction with the analyte
of interest.33,34 In this regard, some supramolecular
host–guest complexes, based on calixarenes,35,36 curcurbituril,6,37 pillarene,38 have been employed for the detection of basic amino acids;
however, they involve simple inclusion complexes of guest molecule
with the host molecule as a sensing ensemble, and thus, they operate
through a single wavelength output, thereby making these sensors prone
to environmental variations. Herein, instead of a simple host–guest
inclusion complex, we employ a supramolecular dye-aggregate assembly
based on a polyanionic cyclodextrin derivative, which yields a ratiometric
response for the basic amino acids, owing to the manipulation of monomer–aggregate
equilibrium upon interaction of the analyte of interest. Moreover,
the ability of supramolecular assemblies to work in an aqueous medium
presents them as an apt platform to sense biomolecules such as amino
acids in aqueous solution. An added advantage of these supramolecular
assemblies is the operation of multiple weak and less selective interactions
in a co-operative manner, which ultimately leads to specific biorecognition
with much simpler design.34

Very
recently, we reported an interesting observation of emissive
H-aggregates of an ultrafast molecular rotor and amyloid marker dye,
thioflavin-T (ThT), on the surface of polyanionic-sulfated β-cyclodextrin
(SCD).39 On this account, we disclose a
simple strategy to exploit SCD-templated ThT aggregate assembly to
detect arginine and lysine in aqueous solution. We envisioned that
arginine and lysine might induce disassembly of ThT aggregates on
the SCD surface, by the virtue of stronger electrostatic interaction
of cationic motifs of arginine and lysine with the anionic sulfate
groups of SCD. This, in turn, may bring out the modulation in monomer–aggregate
equilibrium in the system leading to a ratiometric response. Indeed,
this facile approach of arginine- or lysine-induced disassembly enables
our system to function as an efficient sensor for arginine and lysine
with a ratiometric response in aqueous medium for a sensitive and
selective detection over a large concentration range. The distinctive
features of the ratiometric detection, minus the complex covalent
labeling protocols owned because of the usage of commercially available
ThT, presents our sensor system meritorious over other sensors for
arginine and lysine. Moreover, our sensor system also provides a response
to arginine and lysine in biologically complex media of serum samples,
thus pitching for its usage in practical applications.

2 Experimental Section
ThT was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
as the chloride salt of the
dye and was recrystallized twice from methanol. The purity of the
recrystallized ThT was checked through nuclear magnetic resonance
spectra. β-Cyclodextrin, sulfated sodium (extent of labeling
12–14) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and fetal bovine serum
(FBS) was obtained from HiMedia Laboratories (India). Both were used
as received. All samples were prepared using Nanopure water (conductivity
less than 0.1 μS cm–1) obtained from a Millipore
Milli-Q system.

Ground-state absorption spectra were recorded
with a JASCO UV–visible
spectrophotometer (model V-650). Steady-state fluorescence spectra
were obtained with a HORIBA FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorimeter. All the
measurements were carried out at an ambient temperature (∼25
°C) using a quartz cell of 1 cm path length unless otherwise
stated. For titrations, an incubation time of 15 min was allowed before
measurement.

For the measurement of time-resolved fluorescent
decay traces,
an IBH instrument, based on the time-correlated single-photon counting
principle, was used which has been described in detail elsewhere.40,41 Briefly, a picosecond diode laser (406 nm, ∼100 ps, 1 MHz)
was employed as the excitation source. The details of the fitting
procedure have been detailed in our previous publications.41,42

The decay traces are fitted with a multiexponential function
of
the following form43 1  

The average fluorescence lifetime
is calculated according to the
equation43 2  where αi represents
the amplitude
of the individual decay constants.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectral
measurements were acquired using
a Biologic MOS 450 spectropolarimeter over a wavelength range of 350–500
nm under a constant nitrogen flow at room temperature, using a 1 cm
path length cell. Standard conditions for all measurements consist
of a scan rate of 50 nm/min and an average of three scans for each
sample. CD spectra were recorded as ellipticity (θ) in millidegree,
wherein each spectrum was baseline subtracted from the spectrum of
water only, under same conditions. All measurements were carried out
at pH value of 7.4, near physiological conditions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) was performed using Origin (version 8.6).

The
time-dependent anisotropy was calculated using the following
equation43 3  where I∥ and I⊥ represent the fluorescence
intensity decays for the parallel and perpendicular polarization with
reference to vertically polarized excitation beam. “G” represents the correction factor for the polarization
sensitivity bias of the detection system and was estimated independently.
The perpendicular measurements were checked by repeating the measurements
for at least 2−3 times.

3 Results and Discussion
Because the basic framework of our sensing scheme is the modulation
of photophysical features of SCD-templated ThT aggregates, upon interaction
with arginine and lysine, we first demonstrate the formation of SCD-templated
ThT assembly. The changes in the steady-state emission spectra of
ThT, on its interaction with SCD, are shown in Figure 1. As depicted, an increase in the concentration
of SCD results in a drastic bathochromic shift of ThT emission spectra
from its usual monomeric band at 490 nm to an emission band centered
at 545 nm. Further addition of SCD to an aqueous solution of ThT leads
to the enhancement of emission intensity at 545 nm by ∼20 times
on reaching saturation. The formation of this new bathochromically
shifted enhanced emission band for ThT, in the presence of SCD, has
been attributed to the formation of emissive H-aggregates on the surface
of SCD.39 In aqueous solution, ThT is very
weakly emissive in nature. In the excited state, ThT undergoes an
efficient twisting process around a single bond (central C–C
bond, Scheme 1) in
water or low viscous solvents.44−47 As a consequence of this twisting process, a quick
dissipation of the excitation energy through nonradiative channel
is activated, which renders ThT very weakly emissive in nature.44,48 However, this twisting process is highly dependent on the rigidity
of its microenvironment, which in turn affects the emission yield.
In the present case of SCD, the increase in the emission intensity
of ThT in the presence of SCD can be attributed to the restriction
of twisting process of ThT in the aggregated state, which leads to
the turn-on emission in the presence of SCD.39 Please note that the emission spectra in Figure 1 contain a peak at ∼465 nm which originates
from the Raman response of the solvent.

the emission spectra of ThT in water. The dotted line represents the
Raman response of only water. Inset: Variation of emission intensity
at 545 nm with increasing concentrations of SCD.

Scheme 1 Molecular Structure of ThT
It has been reported that cationic amino acids, such as
lysine
and arginine, by virtue of their positively charged side chains, interact
electrostatically with negatively charged groups such as sulfated
group.49,50 On this basis, we envisaged that lysine
and arginine may interact electrostatically with sulfate-rich macrocyclic
host SCD, which may subsequently result in the disassembly of ThT
H-aggregates from the SCD surface. Thus, to investigate this proposition,
a detailed analysis of the photophysical properties of ThT–SCD
complex in the presence of basic amino acids was performed. The changes
in the fluorescence spectra of ThT–SCD complex were studied
in the presence of increasing concentrations of lysine and are presented
in Figure 2A. It can
be observed from Figure 2A that the fluorescence intensity of ThT–SCD complex decreases
with a gradual increase in the concentration of lysine. At higher
concentrations of lysine, the fluorescence intensity of ThT–SCD
approaches close to that of the monomer form of ThT in water. This
decrease in the fluorescent intensity can be attributed to the dissociation
of ThT H-aggregates from the SCD surface, as a result of stronger
electrostatic interaction of cationic lysine with anionic SCD. Apart
from the electrostatic interaction, lysine is also reported to form
H-bonding with the sulfate groups.49,50 Thus, the
dissociation of ThT H-aggregates from the SCD surface is presumably
facilitated by both electrostatic as well as H-bonding interaction
of lysine with the sulfated groups of SCD. Since the free ThT is weakly
emissive in nature, the disassociation of the emissive H-aggregates
of ThT from the SCD surface toward the monomeric form leads to a decrease
in its emission intensity. Since the gradual addition of lysine to
the ThT–SCD complex causes a change in the equilibrium population
of SCD-bound ThT aggregate (highly emissive) and free ThT (weakly
emissive), the ratio of emission intensity for these two species shall
outline the change in equilibrium population and should yield a lysine
concentration-dependent ratiometric response.

6.5. The blue dashed line represents the emission spectra of ThT in
water. Inset: Variation of emission intensity ratio (I545/I490) with increasing
concentrations of lysine. (B) Normalized ground-state absorption spectrum

dashed black line represents absorption spectra of ThT in water.

Thus, for a quantitative determination
of lysine-induced changes
in fluorescence features of the ThT–SCD system, the ratiometric
analysis of titration data for fluorescence intensities at 545 and
490 nm representing ThT aggregate and monomer form, respectively,
was carried out. The ratio of the fluorescence intensity at these
two wavelengths was plotted as a function of lysine concentration,
and the results are shown in the inset of Figure 2A. The ratio was found to decrease linearly
with the increasing concentrations of lysine in a dynamic range of
0–2000 μM (Figure 2A, inset), and the linear regression was I545/I490 = 2.047–0.0005
[Lys/μM] with the correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.966. The calculated detection limit of lysine
based on 3.3σ/s51 is 40 μM, where σ represents the standard deviation
of 10 blank measurements, whereas “s”
represents the slope of the calibration curve. Thus, this analysis
suggests that the ratiometric response of the present system can be
used for the estimation of lysine in an aqueous solution.

To
decipher whether the addition of lysine causes changes in the
absorption spectra of ThT–SCD complex, the response of the
sensor system was also monitored colorimetrically. To validate that
the origin of bathochromically shifted emission band for ThT–SCD
complex is due to H-aggregate formation, the absorption measurements
of ThT in the presence of SCD were initially recorded (Figure S1, Supporting Information). ThT displays a hypsochromic
shift in its absorption maximum in the presence of SCD (406 nm), when
compared with the aqueous solution (413 nm). The hypsochromic shift
in the absorption band of ThT, upon addition of SCD, has been attributed
to the formation of ThT H-aggregates on SCD surface.39 However, on the addition of lysine in ThT–SCD solution,
a prominent red shift in the absorption maxima can be observed from
406 nm, representing the ThT aggregates, to 413 nm, representing the
ThT monomers, in water (Figure 2B). This shift can be assigned to dissociation of ThT H-aggregates
from SCD host, owing to the stronger electrostatic interaction between
anionic sulfate residues of SCD and cationic side chain of lysine
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Schematic
Representation of Lysine-/Arginine-Induced Dissociation
of ThT Aggregates from SCD Surface
To gain further key insights into the mechanism of interaction
between lysine and ThT–SCD complex, time-resolved fluorescence
emission measurements were carried out for the ThT–SCD complex
in the presence of lysine (Figure 3A). In an aqueous solution, the monomer form of ThT
decays very fast, which is beyond the time resolution of our current
setup [instrument response function (IRF) ≈ 160 ps]. The short
excited-state lifetime of ThT in water is reported to be ∼1
ps and is attributed to ultrafast bond twisting process of ThT in
the excited state, which rapidly dissipates the exciton energy via
nonradiative channel.44

Figure 3 (A) Transient decay trace
for ThT (20 μM) in SCD at varying
concentrations of lysine (in mM) (λex = 406 nm, λem = 545 nm) (1) 0, (2) 0.6, (3) 2.2, (4) 3.5, (5) 4.5, (6)
8.2, and (7) 16.5. The dotted black line represents IRF. Inset: Variation
of the average lifetime (τavg) with increasing concentrations
of lysine. (B) CD spectra of ThT (20 μM) in SCD at varying concentrations
of lysine (0–3.6 mM).

However, in the case of ThT aggregates, formed in presence
of SCD,
the decay trace extends up to few nanoseconds, with multiexponential
decay kinetics (Figure S2, Supporting Information). This long lifetime has been assigned to reduced torsional relaxation
of ThT in the aggregated form.39 It is
quite evident from Figure 3A that with the increase in lysine concentrations, the decay
traces gradually become faster. This gradually faster decay for the
ThT–SCD system in the presence of lysine can be understood
in terms of stronger electrostatic interaction facilitated by the
H-bonding interaction of lysine with SCD, which dominates the existing
interaction between ThT and SCD and results into the release of ThT
monomers in the aqueous phase. Accordingly, the average excited-state
lifetime (τavg), calculated using eq 2, displays a gradual decrease with
increasing concentrations of lysine which follows a linear correlation
equation, τavg (ns) = 1.2–0.0001 [Lys/μM],
with the corresponding correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.935.

The central framework of our sensor
system comprises self-assembled
ThT aggregates on the SCD surface, which are reported to exhibit the
phenomenon of excitonic coupling between transient dipole moments
of dye molecules and hence display a characteristic bisignate feature
in CD spectroscopy.39 Thus, in accordance
with the previous report, a characteristic bisignate CD signal for
ThT in the presence of SCD is observed (Figure S3, Supporting Information). To understand the effect of lysine
on the characteristic bisignate CD signal of ThT–SCD, we measured
the CD spectra of ThT–SCD in the presence of varying concentrations
of lysine, and the results are presented in Figure 3B. It is obvious from Figure 3B that the addition of lysine to ThT–SCD
complex leads to a gradual disappearance of bisignate feature, indicating
the disassociation of ThT H-aggregates from SCD surface presumably
because of the comparatively stronger electrostatic interaction of
SCD with lysine. Thus, CD measurements are consistent with the other
photophysical measurements described earlier in this article for the
effect of lysine in the ThT–SCD system.

After understanding
the effect of lysine on the ThT–SCD
system, we moved to arginine that also contains a positively charged
side chain with a slightly higher pI value of 10.47; thus, it is expected
that the interaction of arginine with the ThT–SCD complex will
result in similar changes in the photophysical features of the ThT–SCD
complex as observed in the case of lysine. Figure 4A shows that the fluorescence intensity of
the ThT–SCD complex decreases on the gradual addition of arginine.
This decrease in fluorescence intensity can be similarly associated
with disassembly of ThT H-aggregates from SCD surface owing to the
relatively stronger electrostatic interaction of cationic arginine
with anionic SCD. Moreover, a gradual shift in the fluorescence spectra
of ThT–SCD was also observed, which further strengthens the
proposition that the electrostatic interaction of SCD and arginine
displaces the ThT aggregates from SCD surface and results in the release
of ThT monomers in the aqueous phase. Similar to the case of lysine,
arginine is also reported to participate in the H-bonding interaction
with the sulfate groups,49 thus likewise
additionally facilitating the disassembly of ThT H-aggregates from
the SCD surface. This transition from the aggregated form of ThT to
its monomeric form was also evident from the ratiometric analysis
of the titration data.

of ThT in water. Inset: Variation of emission intensity ratio (I545/I490) with increasing
concentrations of arginine. (B) Transient decay trace for ThT (20

line represents IRF. Inset: Variation of average lifetime (τavg) with increasing concentrations of arginine.

Please note that the ratio of emission intensity
(I545/I490) initially shows
a nonlinear behavior with the increasing concentrations of arginine;
however, a linear dynamic range is observed for 250–1750 μM
(Figure 4A, inset),
and the linear regression is I545/I490 = 1.43–0.0004 [Arg/μM or mM]
with a correlation coefficient (R2) of
0.9404. The calculated detection limit of arginine based on 3.3σ/s is 50 μM. Note that the nonlinear response for arginine
has been discussed later, in this article, in terms of possible formation
of a ternary complex between ThT–SCD and arginine.

To
complement the steady-state emission measurements for the effect
of arginine addition in ThT–SCD complex, the ground-state absorption
measurements were also performed and their responses are presented
in Figure S4 (Supporting Information).
The gradual addition of arginine in ThT–SCD solution shifts
the absorption maxima from 406 nm, representing ThT aggregates, to
413 nm, representing ThT in bulk water phase. This shift can be attributed
to the disassociation of ThT aggregates from SCD and its release in
the bulk water phase. Thus, the results from ground-state absorption
measurements are in concordance with the steady-state emission measurements.

This arginine-induced disassociation of ThT aggregates from the
SCD surface is also well-supported by time-resolved emission measurements
(Figure 4B), where
decay traces for the ThT–SCD system gradually become faster
with the gradual addition of arginine. This observation of gradually
faster transient decays can be understood from the fact that the relatively
stronger interaction of arginine with SCD releases the bound ThT molecules
toward the bulk water phase, where nonradiative torsional relaxation
of ThT becomes highly efficient leading to a faster decay in the presence
of arginine. It was observed that the average lifetime decreases linearly
with increase in the concentration of arginine (Figure 4B, inset), following a linear correlation
of τavg (ns) = 1.2–0.0002 [Arg/μM],
and the corresponding correlation coefficient (R2) is found to be 0.995.

Similar to the case of lysine,
we also performed the CD measurements
for the ThT–SCD system in the presence of arginine, and the
results are presented in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). As evident, the CD measurements of the ThT–SCD
complex upon addition of arginine result in the disappearance of bisignate
feature of ThT–SCD. Similar to the case of lysine, this disappearance
of the bisignate feature can also be assigned to the disassociation
of ThT aggregates from the SCD surface owing to a stronger electrostatic
interaction between negatively charged SCD and positively charged
arginine.

Thus, steady-state emission, ground-state absorption,
time-resolved
emission, and CD measurements for the effect of arginine on ThT–SCD
are in line with that of lysine, indicating that the interaction of
both lysine and arginine with SCD leads to the dissociation of ThT
H-aggregates from the SCD surface, which is an outcome of relatively
stronger electrostatic interaction of SCD with basic amino acids than
ThT and thus provides a simple way of detecting lysine and arginine
in aqueous solution.

Because the interaction of both lysine
and arginine with ThT−SCD
complex leads to drastic changes in the photophysical properties of
the system, ThT–SCD can be projected for the sensing of basic
amino acids. However, one important criterion to be checked for sensors
is selectivity. To evaluate the selectivity of our sensor system,
ThT–SCD, towards basic amino acids over other α-amino
acids, a percentage decrease in the emission intensity ratio (I545/490) of ThT–SCD was calculated for
the other tested amino acids. As shown in Figure 5, the percentage decrease in the emission
intensity ratio was found to be highest for arginine, followed closely
by lysine, whereas other amino acids only cause relatively insignificant
changes in the ThT–SCD emission. It may be noted that out of
lysine and arginine, arginine shows marginally higher response to
this supramolecular platform. This behavior can be understood from
the fact that arginine is reported to form relatively stronger H-bonding
interaction with the sulfated groups,50 which has been attributed to the relatively hard nature of the guanidine
group of arginine when compared to the amino group of lysine that
leads to stronger interaction of the guanidine group with hard sulfated
groups.50 This suggests that the present
supramolecular platform displays reasonably higher selectivity for
basic amino acids.

Figure 5 Percentage decrease in emission intensity ratio (I545/I490) of ThT
(20 μM)–SCD
(10 μM) in the presence of other amino acids (2.3 mM). Please
note that 2.3 mM concentration is not within the linear regime of
titration for lysine and arginine.

Although arginine shows marginally higher response than lysine,
the discrimination between them would also be desirable and can be
ideally achieved by a sensor array approach, where sensor arrays comprise
a series of cross-reactive sensor elements either by varying the receptor
(SCD in the present case) or by varying the transducer (ThT in the
present case). These sensor arrays generate a recognition pattern
for a specific analyte by using the signal from each sensor element.52 However, the discrimination ability is highly
dependent on the number of employed sensor elements, and usually in
the case of fluorescent sensor arrays, different fluorophores are
commonly employed to provide the cross-reactivity that leads to the
complexity of data collection which requires scanning the emission
spectra of all of the sensor elements or may even require different
excitation wavelengths for each of the sensor element.53 However, in the present case, we realized that
interestingly arginine shows a distinct fluorescence behavior than
lysine, when compared at the identical concentration. For example,
arginine displays a more prominent emission intensity at blue-shifted
wavelength when compared with lysine (Figures 6A and S6, Supporting Information).

Figure 6 (A) Steady-state fluorescence spectrum (λexc =
400 nm) of ThT (20 μM) in SCD at concentration of 0.8 mM for
lysine (blue dashed line) and arginine (red solid line). (B) Recognition
patterns for arginine and lysine (0.36 mM) generated by taking the
logarithm of emission intensity ratios at different wavelengths. (C)

lysine at different concentrations (in mM) (1) 0.4, (2) 0.6, (3) 0.8,
(4) 1.07, (5) 1.4, and (6) 1.7.

Thus, the extent of emission intensity reduction is very
different
when monitored at the blue and red wavelength for lysine and arginine.
Thus, the recognition pattern for arginine and lysine was generated
by collecting the fluorescence variation at four different wavelengths
(470, 490, 520, and 550 nm). Figure 6B suggests that quite different patterns were generated
for lysine and arginine.

Thus, to utilize this unique response
pattern for lysine and arginine,
as a means to discriminate them, emission response at six concentrations,
for both lysine and arginine, were measured, and the resulting emission
intensity variation data at four wavelengths were collected and analyzed
by PCA. The resulting 2D score plot for PCA has been presented in Figure 6C. It is quite clear
from Figure 6C that
both lysine and arginine at different concentrations are grouped in
well-separated clusters. Thus, the present result suggests that the
present supramolecular ensemble alone, without the need of sensor
arrays, shows excellent ability to discriminate between lysine and
arginine.

To know, what could be the possible reason behind
such distinctive
behaviors of arginine and lysine, we have looked into the distinctive
spectral response of arginine when compared to that of lysine. Arginine
displays a more prominent emission at the blue-shifted wavelength
when compared to lysine (Figure 6A). This blue-shifted emission wavelength corresponds
to the monomeric form of ThT. The enhanced emission at the monomeric
emission wavelength suggests that ThT, in its monomeric form, is present
in an environment, which is quite distinct from bulk water because
in bulk water, ThT is very weakly emissive. It is possible that the
interaction of arginine with ThT aggregates on the SCD surface not
only leads to the disassembly of ThT aggregates into water medium
but may also lead to a certain population of ternary complex, involving,
ThT, SCD, and arginine, in which case, ThT will lead to an enhanced
emission in its monomeric form. In fact, it is reported in literature
that among all other amino acids, arginine has a very high tendency
to self aggregate.54 Thus, it is possible
that arginine aggregates at the surface of SCD with ThT trapped in
it. To check this possibility, we have carried out time-resolved anisotropy
measurement (which provides information about the mobility of the
probe) for the ThT–SCD complex in the presence of arginine
and lysine. Thus, it is expected that if a ternary assembly forms
in the case of arginine, then a slower anisotropy decay should be
observed in the case of arginine. Indeed, for arginine, although not
very slow, but a definite slowdown in the anisotropy decay is observed,
(Figure S7, Supporting Information) suggesting
the formation of an assembly in the case of arginine, whereas, for
lysine, the anisotropy decay remains almost unchanged.

To evaluate
the practical usefulness of the present supramolecular
sensing platform, we also attempted to evaluate the response of the
present system in the diluted samples of FBS. The measurements revealed
a successful response of the present sensing system even in the biologically
complex media of FBS, although with a reduced sensitivity, presumably
because of a competitive binding interaction of ThT with other biomolecules
present in the serum matrix (Figures S8 and S9 Supporting Information). However, to further improve the performance
of the present sensor system for biological samples, the sample preparation
stage involving methods such as solid-phase extraction, liquid-phase
extraction, and so forth may be employed to minimize the matrix effect,
along with the analyte preconcentration step, which may significantly
improve the sensitivity of the current sensor system.55 Thus, these results suggest that the present supramolecular
sensing platform has the potential to be utilized in biological samples.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we report a simple ratiometric
sensor, operating through
fluorimetry, for a rapid and selective detection of lysine and arginine,
based on ThT H-aggregates-assembled dynamic supramolecular platform
of SCD. The sensitive and selective sensing of basic amino acids is
achieved by drastic modulations of the photophysical properties of
SCD templated ThT H-aggregates, when subjected to interactions with
lysine and arginine. Besides being based on the supramolecular framework,
which endows an inherent applicability of the present sensor in aqueous
medium, it also employs an inexpensive commercially available probe
molecule, ThT, thus making our sensing approach label-free and advantageous
over a large majority of sensor system which suffer from the need
of complex and time-consuming multistep synthesis. More importantly,
our sensor system yields a ratiometric response to arginine and lysine
over a wide dynamic range. This feature of ratiometric response makes
the performance of our sensor system more robust to the variations
under experimental conditions and is certainly a desirable advantage
over sensor systems operating through single wavelength output. We
also demonstrate that the closely related basic amino acids, arginine
and lysine, can be successfully discriminated using recognition patterns
with the help of PCA. Further, our sensor system could also respond
to basic amino acids in the competitive biological media of FBS, thus
promising its possible application in biological samples.
