Electrostatic interactions
play a pivotal role in the structure
and mechanism of action of most biomolecules. There are several conceptually
different methods to deal with electrostatics in molecular dynamics
simulations. Ionic strength effects are usually introduced using such
methodologies and can have a significant impact on the quality of
the final conformation space obtained. We have previously shown that
full system neutralization can lead to wrong lipidic phases in the
25% PA/PC bilayer (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2014,10, 5483–5492). In this work,
we investigate how two limit approaches to the ionic strength treatment
(implicitly with GRF or using full system neutralization with either
GRF or PME) can influence the conformational space of the second-generation
PAMAM dendrimer. Constant-pH MD simulations were used to map PAMAM’s
conformational space at its full pH range (from 2.5 to 12.5). Our
simulations clearly captured the coupling between protonation and
conformation in PAMAM. Interestingly, the dendrimer conformational
distribution was almost independent of the ionic strength treatment
methods, which is in contrast to what we have observed in charged
lipid bilayers. Overall, our results confirm that both GRF with implicit
ionic strength and a fully neutralized system with PME are valid approaches
to model charged globular systems, using the GROMOS 54A7 force field.

1 Introduction
There
are numerous examples of interesting charged systems across
the biophysical, biochemical, and chemical fields, such as anionic
lipid domains of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes1 and cationic proteins such as staphylococcal
nuclease.2 In these systems, electrostatic
interactions have a central role and, therefore, the ionic strength
of the solution also becomes very important. Ionic strength influences
the conformational space of molecules by attenuating their electrostatic
interactions either directly or via screening effects.3,4

In molecular dynamics simulations, ionic strength effects
can be
introduced in an exclusively implicit manner by adding an extra attenuating
term to the reaction field formalism (generalized reaction field,
GRF)5 or by including explicit ions. In
the latter case, it is common to simply add enough counter ions to
achieve neutrality or to add extra ions, after neutrality, to obtain
the desired ionic strength.

We have previously reported that,
when dealing with charged membranes,
in the GROMOS 54A7 force field, the system neutralization leads to
simulations not being able to reproduce the correct experimental lipidic
phases.6 To accurately describe the phase
transition in 25% of phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylcholine
(PC) anionic membranes, a new method to treat ionic strength was introduced.6,7 This method estimates the ion concentration near the bilayer using
the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation. In the studied charged
membrane systems, even though the number of ions estimated from PB
is usually not enough to neutralize the simulation box, the membrane
properties observed were in better agreement with experimental results.
When these systems were neutralized, the lipid bilayers remained too
ordered, in the gel phase even at full ionization, probably because
of excess of stabilizing counterions trapped near the membrane. By
contrast, a simpler approach relying exclusively on GRF with an implicit
ionic strength resulted in lipid bilayers being too unstable. This
issue regarding the ionic strength treatment in MD simulations of
charged membrane systems may have a profound effect on the quality
of the model being simulated.6,7

Aware of the limitations
in modeling ionic strength effects in
charged membrane systems, we now question whether these effects are
also present in charged globular systems, such as proteins or dendrimers.
In this work, we explore whether the conformational space of one of
such systems is influenced by different approaches for ionic strength
inclusion. We opted for a second-generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM)
dendrimer because it only has cationic groups, which simplifies the
problem, and at low pH values will exhibit a significant positive
charge.8 The PAMAM dendrimer is a ramified
structure repeating tertiary amino groups, connected by amide bonds
and ending with primary amines at the outer layer. Even at full ionization,
it will retain its globular shape, similarly to proteins, and its
conformational space can be reasonably described by its radius of
gyration.9 Other advantages are its high
structural plasticity, relatively high charge density, and titrable
sites that are solvent-accessible. Hence, PAMAM should be more sensitive
to ionic strength than a regular globular protein, which renders it
a good system to check for differences in the protonation/conformation
space between ionic strength treatment methods. This can be seen as
a worst case scenario for what happens with regular proteins at physiological
pH.

Lowering the pH, all amino groups in PAMAM will eventually
protonate
and expose their positive charges. The presence/absence of counterions
in the simulation box should have an effect on charge repulsion between
amino groups, their pKa values, and consequently,
on how much these groups prefer to be exposed to solvent. We rely
on constant-pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations10−27 to capture the coupling between amino group protonation and the
conformational space of the PAMAM dendrimer. We can generate full
titration curves that can be compared with experimental data8 for validation. A CpHMD method is thermodynamically
more appropriate to explore PAMAM conformational space at a given
pH value. Because proton occupancies are combinatorial by nature,
MD simulations at fixed protonation states become impractical when
several amino groups protonate at similar pH values and affect the
proton affinities of neighboring groups. Furthermore, even if all
relevant protonation combinations were simulated, the overall correlation
between protonation and conformation would still not be fully captured
because of the unknown weights of each protonation combination, as
abundantly discussed in most CpHMD literature (e.g., see ref (10)). Our CpHMD method has
been developed and optimized to work with GROMOS force fields, currently
precluding the investigation of this neutralization issue with other
force fields.

The treatment of long-range electrostatics also
plays an important
role in MD simulations of charged systems. Arguably, the most commonly
used methods to deal with long-range interactions are particle mesh
Ewald (PME) and reaction field (RF) or GRF. In Ewald summation-derived
methods, the slowly conditionally convergent long-range interactions
potential of a periodic system is separated into two rapidly convergent
series. From a physical perspective, this is achieved by adding and
then subtracting a charge distribution to the original point charge.
The addition of a charge distribution of equal magnitude and opposite
sign weakens the Coulombic interactions, allowing their potential
to be calculated by a direct sum in the real space. The effect of
an extra charge distribution is then corrected in the reciprocal space
by subtracting an equal charge distribution and contribution of the
interaction between the original charge and the added distribution.
In PME, the Gaussian distribution charges in the reciprocal space
are mapped onto a grid and the potential is efficiently calculated
by leveraging a fast Fourier transform algorithm.28−31

The RF methods are based
on Onsager’s work,32 in which the
explicit (noncontinuum) system polarizes the
surrounding dielectric, which in turn will act back. The implementation
of such methods is made by applying a cutoff distance around the molecule
from which it is assumed that there is a homogeneous medium with a
fixed dielectric constant. Within this cutoff distance, the electrostatic
potential of the Coulombic interactions between the solute and solvent
sites are calculated to satisfy the Poisson equation. The GRF method,
based on Kirkwood’s method,33,34 uses the general
solution to the linearized PB equation in a sphere, which includes
the effect of bulk ionic strength.5,31

As RF
and GRF assume a spherical mean-field approximation beyond
a cutoff in inhomogeneous systems, such as lipid bilayers, this assumption
is no longer valid. However, RF or GRF has been shown to reproduce
the experimental lipidic phases of PC-based lipid bilayers35,36 and the pH-dependent phase transition in the 25% PA/PC anionic membrane.6,7 Also, RF methods generate energy discontinuity on the surface of
the cutoff sphere, while PME introduces artificial periodicity in
the system.37 Another limitation in PME
is that it requires a full system neutralization, which might not
be physical in some charged systems, where full neutralization can
be attained only at 3 or 4 nm away from the solute.6 Alternatively, PME can also be used in a charged system
with a neutralizing uniform background charge density, but this can
be a rough approximation and has already been found to introduce artifacts
in inhomogeneous systems.38 In overall,
both methods rely on assumptions and approximations and should be
selected based on these approximations, and ultimately, on their ability
to reproduce the experimental data.

In this work, we employed
CpHMD simulations of the second-generation
PAMAM dendrimer at its full pH range (from 2.5 to 12.5) to investigate
the effects of using two limit approaches to the ionic strength treatment:
implicitly (GRF) and full system neutralization with explicit ions
(GRF or PME). In this context, more important than the ability of
a given setup to reproduce the experimental data will be the direct
comparison between ionic strength treatment approaches. In the future,
this will help us make a better informed choice of which approach
to use with GROMOS 54A7 in regular MD and CpHMD simulations of globular
systems.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 PAMAM
Titration
The CpHMD simulations
were performed at different pH values, and they allowed us to obtain
full titration curves from the average protonation states (Figure 1a). Our titration
curves were able to capture the experimental curve trend where primary
amines seem to titrate at higher pH values (8–11), while tertiary
amines only become protonated at acidic pH (3–7) separated
by a short plateau region. This plateau is not easily observed in
our titration curves, but the separation between the two titration
regions becomes clear in the primary/tertiary individual curves (Figure 1b). The calculated
titration curves are shifted toward higher pH values, particularly
for the tertiary amines. The reason for these deviations lies in the
used pKmethod values, which were calibrated
to predict the experimental pKa values
of simple aliphatic amines, such as ethyl, diethyl, and triethyl amines.
It seems that these values cannot be easily transferred from these
compounds to PAMAM where the amino groups are bridged by amide bonds,
which might be introducing quantum effects not completely captured
by continuum electrostatic methods. The most significant difference
between the calculated curves is observed at pH 7.5, where GRF with
no ions is more charged than the neutral systems. This suggests that,
in this pH region, the presence of counterions induces more compact
conformations (see below), and the shorter distances between amino
groups favor the neutral forms.

Figure 1 Total titration curves for the simulated
and experimental8 second-generation PAMAM
(a) and the partial titration
curves for the three different types of amines (b).

The three calculated titration curves were obtained
using different
methods to treat ionic strength (see the Methods section). Interestingly, similar results were obtained with all
approaches, which indicates a low sensibility to the presence of counterions,
contrary to that observed in charged membrane systems.6,7 This result can be explained by a weaker interaction between PAMAM
and counterions (see the Counterion Effects section), a smaller availability of Cl– ions due
to the different ion diffusion dimensionality and/or because protonation
does not depend so much on the conformations of the solute.

2.2 PAMAM Conformational Analysis
A clear
advantage of choosing a dendrimer system for our study is that we
can capture most of the conformational variability with a simple structural
property such as the radius of gyration (Rg) (Figure 2). From
the simulations, we observe a strong protonation/conformational coupling
where PAMAM increases its Rg with decreasing
pH. This is a simple response to the increasing charge repulsion,
as observed in other dendrimers.39−42 Furthermore, the presence of
counterions allows the dendrimer to sample slightly more compact conformations,
suggesting that at least a fraction of those ions are interacting
directly and stabilizing the charged amines.

of gyration at different pH values (a) and
at the corresponding PAMAM charge values (b).

Validating structural information by comparing between simulations
and experiments is seldom straightforward.43 The Rg data about G2-PAMAM in the literature
are scarce, and most values available are obtained from computational
MD simulations with very limited sampling.44−48 The longest production runs employed were obtained
from 30 ns simulations,48 which is similar
to what we disregard in our work because of the values of Rg not being equilibrated. There are SAXS experiments
performed on G2-PAMAM in methanol which allowed the calculation of Rg values (1.1149 and
1.18 nm50). However, it is difficult to
compare these values with our work, even at high pH values because
of the solvent difference, which may have a significant nonobvious
impact on the dendrimer structure. Furthermore, although hydrodynamic
radii for PAMAM-G2 have been obtained by DOSY NMR at different pH
values,51 the two kinds of radii are not
directly comparable.52

The dendrimer’s
more stretched conformations, typical of
low pH values, also seem to induce a higher solvent exposure, which
results in a solvent-accessible surface (SAS) area profile very similar
to that observed for Rg (Figure S1 in
the Supporting Information). As expected,
the solvent exposure of the different amino groups depends on the
topological position and on the pH region they titrate (Figure S2
in the Supporting Information). The primary
amines are more solvent-exposed than the tertiary amines in all the
pH range because they are in the outer layer of PAMAM. Interestingly,
the most external tertiary amines (outer branch) are, at acidic pH
values, the least exposed. This is probably related with transient
interactions between these amino groups and the carbonyls of the outer
amide segments (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). These interactions are significantly less common in the inner
amines because of a lower flexibility of the adjacent amide carbonyls,
which would need to rotate ∼180° to establish the interaction.

The PAMAM conformational space can also be described by the average
number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (Figure 3). All systems show a minimum number of hydrogen
bonds at pH values below 6.5, maintaining a residual hydrogen bond
average number of ∼1.5. Above this pH value, the total charge
decreases (Figure 3b), leading to a lower repulsion between amino groups and, consequently,
to a high number of hydrogen bonds. When using GRF without counterions
in charged PAMAM, there is always slightly less hydrogen bonds due
to a smaller attenuation of charge repulsions.

Figure 3 Average number of hydrogen
bonds in PAMAM at different pH (a) and
ionization (b) values. The hydrogen bond criteria are described in
the Methods section.

2.3 Counterion Effects
The distribution
of ions around PAMAM shows strong pH dependence (Figure 4). In more charged dendrimers,
we observe a higher abundance of interacting counterions which decreases
with higher pH (deprotonation). The first (0.22 nm), second (∼0.42
nm), and third (∼0.62 nm) peaks correspond to ions replacing
water molecules in the first three solvation shells. When PAMAM is
almost fully deprotonated (pH 11.5), the only chloride ion in the
system favors the aqueous solvent. Also, the ion distribution seems
independent of the used long-range electrostatics treatment because
we obtained an almost identical ion distribution profile for the simulations
using PME (Figure S4).

Figure 4 Probability density of
the minimum distance between each Cl– and PAMAM
in the GRF system. The dendrimer has an
average total charge of 29.8, 19.0, 14.1, 9.3, and 0.6, at pH values
2.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, and 11.5, respectively.

In globular systems, ions approaching the solute will experience
a high concentration effect because of the significant decrease in
the layer volume (Figure 5). Note that in a planar slab (like in membranes), the volume
does not vary with distance, being proportional to the thickness of
the layer being considered (Δr, Figure 5), whereas in a more globular
geometry (such as in PAMAM), distant layers will occupy higher volumes
than closer ones with the same thickness (Δr, Figure 5). This
effect probably limits the accumulation of counterions near PAMAM,
even when highly charged. To compare the two geometries, we used a
highly charged PAMAM dendrimer (+30 charges) and a charged PA/PC membrane
(−48 charges). These have similar surface charge densities
(0.19 C m–2 for PAMAM and 0.21 C m–2 for PA/PC bilayer6) obtained from a rough
approximation of their shape (a sphere with a radius equal to the
average Rg, 1.4 nm, and a plane, x × y box vectors). We do not claim
the PAMAM structure to be a sphere; we just use this simplification
to estimate the surface charge densities of a globular fully charged
PAMAM. From the simulations of these two systems, we computed the
average counterion concentration when approaching the solute (Figure 6). We observe a clear
difference between both distributions at higher distances. In PAMAM,
there is a gradual convergence to a long (bulk) ionic strength value,
whereas in the PA/PC, this distribution drops to ∼0 at short
distances (∼1 nm). This excess in counterion binding to a lipid
bilayer has already been observed6,7 and may be
related with inaccurate force field parameters for cations.53,54Figure 6 also shows
that the ion concentration at the first and second solvation shells
are very similar, despite the different number of total counterions
available. In fact, in PAMAM distribution, the two peaks correspond
to ∼3 and ∼7 counterions, whereas in the PA/PC bilayer,
there are ∼13 and ∼31 counterions in the same two regions.
This difference perfectly illustrates the layer volume variation effect
and helps understand why globular systems are more robust to changes
in the ionic strength methods used.

geometries of PAMAM
(spherical) and PA/PC membranes (planar). The amino groups, in PAMAM,
and the phosphorus atoms, in the lipid bilayer, are shown as blue
and orange spheres, respectively.

Figure 6 Counterion concentration distribution around PAMAM and PA/PC bilayer6 of similar charge density (0.19 C m–2 for PAMAM and 0.21 C m–2 for PA/PC). The number
of counterions present in the PAMAM system is 30 Cl–, while for PA/PC, it is 48 Na+. The distribution was
averaged using a floating window with a 0.2 nm bin size and a 0.01
nm increasing step.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we performed constant-pH MD simulations of second-generation
PAMAM in its full pH range (from 2.5 to 12.5). The ionic strength
effects were introduced in the simulations by using two limit approaches,
implicitly with GRF or using full system neutralization with either
GRF or PME. Our simulations clearly captured the coupling between
protonation and conformation in these PAMAM dendrimers.

The
calculated titration curves are in reasonable agreement with
experimental data, clearly distinguishing between the contributions
from the different amino groups of the dendrimer. Also, we observed
that in our globular PAMAM dendrimer system, even when highly charged
(i.e., at low pH), its conformational space is only slightly dependent
on the ionic strength treatment methods. The presence of explicit
counterions neutralizing our system has only a small effect on most
of its structural properties. Therefore, it seems that counterions
do not play such a crucial role in our PAMAM simulations, in contrast
to what we observed in charged lipid bilayers.6

The fact that this charged globular system is mostly insensitive
to changes in the ionic strength methods used can be explained by
the small number of counterions directly interacting with PAMAM in
the nearest solvation shells. In these systems, because of their radial
topology, the ion accessible volume decreases sharply when approaching
the solute, leading to significant ion–ion repulsion. In charged
bilayer systems, even though there is a much larger number of ions
bound to the solute, there is no equivalent volume variation, resulting
in ion concentrations similar to PAMAM.

In conclusion, our results
with this worst case scenario system
indicate that these most common methods to deal with electrostatics
and ionic strength effects are valid approaches to model charged globular
systems in regular MD and CpHMD simulations using the GROMOS 54A7
force field.

4 Methods
4.1 Constant-pH
MD Settings
All CpHMD
simulations were performed with the stochastic titration constant-pH
MD method.7,10−12,39,42,55−66 This method was implemented for the GROMACS package and consists
of a MM/MD simulation in which the protonation states of a given molecule
titrable sites are allowed to change. The exchange in protonation
is determined by a Poisson–Boltzmann/Monte Carlo (PB/MC) step
at a τprt interval (2 ps). After the protonation
state update, a short MD of duration τrlx (0.2 ps)
with a frozen solute allows the solvent to adapt to the new environment
(for further details, please see refs (11) and (66)).

The second-generation PAMAM molecule used in this
work has 30 titrable sites distributed in a radial symmetry. These
sites consist of 2 core branch tertiary amines, 4 first-generation
branch tertiary amines, 8 second-generation branch tertiary amines,
and 16 end primary amines at the outer shell (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Chemical Structure of a second-generation PAMAM
(A). Conformations
of an extendend PAMAM molecule at the low pH value (B) and a typical
compact conformation at the high pH value (C). The amine types are
color coded in the picture: red for a core amine, blue for an inner
branch amine, purple for an outer branch amine, and green for a primary
amine.

All amines were allowed to titrate
in the complete pH range (from
pH 2.5 to 12.5 in 1 unit steps). The branching tertiary amines connect
two identical arms which can be distinguished by the protonation states
of their amino groups. Also, because of a low energy barrier to inversion,
these can racemize in the μs timescale. In GROMOS 54A7, these
amino groups are not allowed to invert; hence, the final racemization
obtained is only due to the fast changing of the protonation states
obtained in our CpHMD simulations. Three different systems of PAMAM
were set up, in which the ionic strength treatment was varied: without
the addition of explicit ions, where GRF was used with an implicit
ionic strength; and with the addition of explicit anions (Cl–) to approximately neutralize the simulation box, using two long-range
electrostatics methods, GRF (at the intended ionic strength) or PME.
All simulations were performed at ionic strength 0.1 M to match the
experimental titration curve.8 In all “neutral”
systems, the choice of the number of ions to include in our simulations
required a self-consistent iterative procedure consisting of the following
steps. First, an initially estimated number of ions is added to the
simulation box; after 30 ns, the average box net charge is evaluated
and a new attempt is made to attain neutrality. The procedure stops
when the difference between the number of ions and the dendrimer charge
is less than 1 unit (Table 1). In this procedure, the simulation box will not be completely
neutralized, it simply ensures that the total charge fluctuates near
zero (the standard deviations estimate the size of these fluctuations).
Five replicates of 100 ns each (where the first 20 ns of every simulation
were disregarded to account for the system equilibration) were done
for each pH value, which led to a total cumulative simulation time
of 15.5 μs.

4.2 Charge Parameterization of the Amino Groups
The amino groups model compounds used were parameterized from simple
amines: ethylamine, diethylamine, and triethylamine for the primary,
secondary, and tertiary amines, respectively. The atomic partial charges
(Table S1 in the Supporting Information) were obtained from the RESP protocol,67 which fitted them to the electrostatic potential determined from
geometry optimization in Gaussian 0968 using
the B3LYP functional69−71 and the 6-31G(d) basis set.72 The pKmod values were obtained (Table
S2 in the Supporting Information) from
a calibration protocol,59 using CpHMD simulations
of the three different amines and fitting to the desired experimental
pKa values.73

4.3 MM/MD Settings
The MM/MD simulations
were done with a modified version of the GROMOS 54A7 force field74 using GROMACS 4.0.7,75 also modified to include a user-specified ionic strength value for
the GRF.11 There were ∼12300 explicit
SPC76 water molecules in our systems, which
only varied because of replacement with ions, in a rhombic dodecahedral
simulation box with periodic boundary conditions. Long-range electrostatics
were treated either with GRF or PME. GRF was used with twin-range
cutoffs of 0.8 and 1.4 nm, with the neighbor lists being periodically
updated every step or every 5 steps, respectively; a relative permittivity
constant of 5477 and an ionic strength
of 0.1 M were also used. With PME, we used a plain cutoff scheme of
0.9 nm to compute the short-range interactions and a Fourier space
grid of 0.12 nm. The Lennard–Jones cutoffs were set to 1.4
in GRF and decreased to 0.9 nm in PME to use and update a single pair
list, leading to increased computational speed without disregarding
significant Lennard–Jones contributions. The simulations were
performed with a 2 fs integration step.

All MD simulations were
performed in the NPT ensemble. Temperature was kept constant using
the v-rescale thermostat78 at 298 K with
a relaxation time of 0.1 ps in a separate coupling for PAMAM and solvent
(including ions). To maintain constant pressure at 1 bar, we used
the Parrinello–Rahman coupling scheme79 with a relaxation time of 2.0 ps and a compressibility of 4.5 ×
10–5 bar–1. The LINCS algorithm80 was used to constrain all solute bonds, and
SETTLE81 was used for water molecules.

The minimization procedure consisted of three consecutive sets
of ∼2000 steps with varying integrators: unconstrained steepest
descent followed by unconstrained low-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
and, finally, another set of steepest descent but this time with all
bonds constrained. The initiation procedure consisted of two sequential
MD runs of 50 ps with different restraints on the PAMAM molecule.
In the first run, all heavy atoms were restrained with a force constant
of 1000 kJ·mol–1·nm–2, while in the second run, only the nitrogen atoms were restrained.

4.4 Poisson–Boltzmann/Monte Carlo Settings
The PB calculations were done with DelPhi V5.182 using GROMOS 54A7 force field partial charges, with the
exception of the amino group charges. Atomic radii were derived from
the Lennard–Jones parameters of each atom against the oxygen
of a water molecule.83 The relative permittivity
constants were 2 for PAMAM and 80 for the solvent. We used a temperature
of 298 K and an ionic strength of 0.1 M. All PB calculations were
done in a cubic grid with coulombic boundary potential. We used a
two-step focusing procedure84 with 61 grid
points and the focus grid being four times smaller than the coarser
grid (corresponding to a grid space of 1.0 for the coarser grid and
0.25 for the smaller). The convergence threshold value was set to
0.01kBT/e.

PETIT V1.685 was used to perform
the Monte Carlo sampling of protonation states with 105 cycles. Each cycle consists of random trial exchanges of the protonation
state of all individual sites and pairs of sites with an interaction
larger than 2 pH units that are either accepted or rejected according
to a Metropolis criterion.86

4.5 Analyses
The analyses were carried
out on the equilibrated segments of all simulations using tools from
the GROMACS package75 together with in-house
scripts. To calculate the hydrogen bonds in PAMAM, we need to circumvent
a CpHMD-specific feature:56 all possible
protonation positions have explicit protons present throughout the
simulation, varying only in their charge upon (de)protonation events.
Thus, we defined hydrogen bonds with simple 3.2 Å distance criteria87 for two nitrogen atoms or a nitrogen atom and
an oxygen atom. All error bars show the standard error of the mean
between the different replicates. PyMOL was used to generate all structural
representations.88
