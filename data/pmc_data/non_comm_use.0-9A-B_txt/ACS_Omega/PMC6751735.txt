In
this work, four immobilized kinds of mixed microorganisms were prepared
by uploading oil-degradation bacteria into the cross-linked biodegradable
polyacrylamide and sodium alginate mixture supporting material, which
were employed for efficient degradation of oily wastewater. The morphology
of immobilized microbial pellets was characterized by scanning electron
microscopy after 7d and 14d of duration. The components of residual
crude oil were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry,
and the microbial degradation and evolution of n-alkanes,
terpenoids, and steroids were studied. The results show that the oil
degradation rate for experimental group I (sample containing 1% crude
oil) and experimental group II (sample containing 3% crude oil) reaches
as high as 70 and 40%, respectively, after 14d of degradation of saturated
hydrocarbon total petroleum hydrocarbons. For different oil components,
the degradation degree is in the order of tricycoloditerpanes >
homohopanes > norhopanes. The order of the degradation degree of
steroids with different carbon atoms is C27 > C28 > C29. In terms of evolution characteristics,
it can be seen from the biological evolution parameters of n-alkanes that only a slight degradation for odd-even carbon
by biodegradable bacteria was achieved, whereas high degradation for
isoprene alkanes was observed. According to the biological evolution
parameters of hopane and sterane, hopane C31α β-22S/22S
+ R and sterane C29α α20S/20(S + R) were all greater than
0.4, that is, they are all strongly degraded by microorganisms.

==== Body
Introduction
Petroleum is one of the main energy resources
of modern industry worldwide. In the process of petroleum exploitation,
transportation, storage, and use, oil leakage often occurs because
of improper safety measures and sudden accidents, which results in
a large amount of oily wastewater and environmental pollution,1 so there is an urgent need to exploit the efficient
strategy for disposal of oily wastewater.

To date, a number
of approaches have been developed for the treatment of wastewater,
including separation,2 absorption,3 and solar steam generation;4−7 Ajmia Chouchene studied a combined
process of absorption on sawdust, a low-cost renewable absorbents,
and an energetic valorization via combustion was studied.8 Li developed a new oil-bearing wastewater separation device dissolved air flotation
tower and studied the application prospect of this column in separating
emulsified oil droplets from oil-bearing wastewater.9 Among these mentioned methods for the treatment of oily
wastewater, the microbial method is favored for its low cost and no
secondary pollution.10,11 Compared with other technologies,
immobilized biotechnology has the following advantages: It is beneficial
to increase the concentration and purity of microorganisms in the
bioreactor, maintain high-efficiency strains, have strong stability,
and easy to control reaction. Therefore, in recent decades, immobilized
biotechnology has been rapidly developed and widely used. Though great
progress has been achieved in this direction, the big challenge still
remains in connection to the difficulty for degradation of petroleum
with complex composition by a single strain or the degradation can
only be performed to a certain stage. More worse in some cases, this
issue can only be addressed by a synergy effect of a broad variety
of microorganisms. In this regard, the selection, optimization, and
combination of various microorganisms for degradation of oils have
been studied. For instance, Chen showed that the mixed strains could
not only degrade n-alkanes but also better promote
the biological transformation of hopane compounds.12,13 Rambeloarisoa E studied how a mixture of bacteria, with nitrogen,
phosphorus, and iron added to seawater, can degrade crude oil very
effectively, especially in the case of petroleum.14 In view of above investigations, the synergy effect of
different microorganisms could indeed improve the degradation efficiency
of petroleum with complex composition; however, the direct application
of microorganisms has obvious limitations, for example, unstable,
easy to be lost, degradation efficiency dramatically influenced by
surrounding environment, and so forth. Accordingly, immobilized microorganism
technology is a modern engineering technique which can restrict or
locate free microorganism in a certain specific space by physical
or chemical methods to keep the density and activity of microorganisms.15 Based on these merits, the immobilized microbial
technology (IMT) has been extensively adopted to enhance the oil treatment
capacity and adaptability of microbial species to harsh environment.
On the other hand, in comparison with that of direct application of
microorganisms, IMT have great advantages such as high bioload, low
microorganisms loss,16 strong tolerance
to environments,17 high biostability,18 easy storage, and so forth. The traditional
methods of immobilizing microorganisms are mainly adsorption, cross-linking,
covalent bonding, and embedding.19−22 In these cases, as a matter of
fact, the chemical nature of the substrates for immobilizing microorganisms
is of great importance in addition to their porosity, loading capacity,
and so on. The substrates with desired chemical composition would
not only facilitate the loading and immobilizing of microorganisms
but also could provide nutrition for feeding and proliferation of
microorganisms. In contrast, the substrate is not rich in chemical
composition, which is not conducive to the growth of microorganisms.

So far, unfortunately, the investigation involving the optimization
of various microorganisms and immobilizing them into an ideal substrate
for construction of efficient IMT for oils degradation is rare because
it is difficult to incorporate these factors into one material. Therefore,
the development of efficient IMT containing optimization of various
microorganisms as well as suitable loading substrates should be of
special interest for the oil treatment.

In this work, we report
the immobilization of four kinds of mixed microorganisms, which was
prepared by uploading oil-degradation bacteria into the cross-linked
biodegradable polyacrylamide (PAM) and sodium alginate (SA) mixture
supporting material, for efficient degradation of oily wastewater.
The degradation rate of saturated hydrocarbon total petroleum hydrocarbons
(TPH) was studied by such immobilization of microorganisms. In addition,
the evolution characteristics for n-alkanes sterane
and hopane were systematically investigated. The results show that
the immobilization of mixed microorganism could have a better degradation
degree of TPH than that of free bacterials.23 Also, the findings of the investigation on evolution characteristics
would be expected for providing of useful guidance for future optimization
of mixed microorganisms for TPH degradation.

Experimental Section
Oil Sample
The oil sample is dissolved in n-hexan, and it
is heated in a water bath at 68 °C. The standard oil sample is
obtained after evaporation of n-hexane and stored
in a dry environment. Oil samples from a petrochemical plant in Lanzhou oil.

Mixed Bacteria Agents
The petroleum degrading bacteria used in this study were collected
from long-term petroleum-contaminated wastewater by the laboratory
in the previous research topics, namely, X1, D1, A1 and A2, wherein
X1 belongs to the genus Pseudomonas, D1 belongs to the genus Acinetobacter, and A1 and A2 belong to the genus Bacillus.24 Four strains of bacteria were cultured
in three stages to prepare a bacterial solution. A mixed suspension
of the bacteria was prepared in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 and placed in a
50 mL Erlenmeyer flask for 2 days. When the number of colonies reached
1 × 108 when it is in/mL, it can be taken out and
stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C.25

Preparation of Immobilized Microorganism Pellets
PAM (0.3
g) and 0.5 g of SA were added into a 50 mL beaker, they were thoroughly
stirred with 17.5 mL of sterile water, and placed on a plastic wrap
for 12 h to completely fuse into a gelatinous shape.26 It was heated to the flow dynamics in a sterile room, 0.4
g of corn stalk was weighed together with 10 mL of bacterial liquid
(note that the heating temperature should not exceed 40 °C, so
as to not overheat and make some bacteria inactivated), stirred well,
and then 20 mL was sucked into a medical syringe and dropped into
the prepared saturated calcium chloride solution. It was placed for
3–6 h, washed, and stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C, and
the pellets were prepared as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Immobilized microbial pellet.

Characterization
The morphologies of samples were examined
by using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-6701F, JEOL, Ltd.) after
coating the samples with an Au film.

Experimental Design
In the oscillatory incubator with constant temperature and humidity,
oily wastewater from 100 mL conical bottle was used to repair the
simulated microorganism in situ in the environment of the coexistence
of immobilized microorganism, and the high efficiency microbial mixture
was applied to the remediation of petroleum polluted wastewater. The
experiment was divided into two groups: experimental group I and experimental
group II. The crude oil content was 1 and 3% of the quality of oily
wastewater, respectively. The test period was 14 days, and the gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) was measured
once on the 7th and 14th day. The specific programmes are shown in Table 1:

Table 1 Experimental Design
classification	BG	EG I	EG II	
standard oil/g	0.4	0.4	1.2	
sterile water/mL	40	40	40	
PSM ball/g	0	10	10	
Determination Method of GC–MS
The degraded sample (10 g) was taken for soxhlet extraction. The
extracted solution of 5 mL was dehydrated by using anhydrous sodium
sulfate, filtered by using a 0.22 μ m organic solvent resistant
filter membrane, blew dry with nitrogen, then dissolved in 1 mL of n-hexane as a sample. The quality of each series of compounds
in degraded petroleum was detected and analyzed by GC–MS. The
peak area of each series of compounds was converted into the relative
percentage content, and the absolute residue (μg) of each series
of compounds was calculated by the absolute content of the internal
standard (44-deuterated hexadecane).27 There
are many substances of the same mass in the components of petroleum
mixtures, but the structure of the substances is different. In the
GC–MS ion source of TPH, because of the different structure
of each molecular matter in the petroleum component, when bombarded
into fragments by electron current, there will be their own characteristic
fragment ions. The particle fragments of n-alkanes
are 57, 71, 85 ..., therefore, the same series of substances can be
extracted by using the characteristic fragment value.

Analysis
of Biological Evolution Parameters of n-Alkanes
The alkane main peak carbon and ∑C21–/∑C22+ parameters reflect the tendency of high-carbon alkanes
to low-carbon alkanes to be converted by alkanes, and the larger the
parameter, the stronger the ability of bacteria to degrade high-carbon
alkanes.28 The more the main peak carbon
shifts, the stronger the ability of bacteria to degrade high-carbon
alkanes. The OEP value reflects the ability of the bacteria to degrade
odd–even carbon alkanes. The smaller the value, the stronger
the ability to degrade odd-numbered carbon-alkanes, whereas the greater
the value, the stronger the ability to degrade even carbon alkanes.
The ratio of planting [w(pr)/w(ph)]
is the ratio of decane to phytane, which is commonly used in isoprenoids
hydrocarbons. The larger the value, the more difficult it is to degrade
the isoprenoids and the more obvious the oxidation.29

Analysis of Biological Evolution Parameters
of Hopane and Sterane
The maturity parameters commonly used
for hopane and sterane are C31-αβ-22S/22(S + R) and C29-ααα-20S/20(S
+ R), both of which are mature at >0.4, <0.2 immature, between
0.2 and 0.4 is a low maturity marker. However, the value of low-mature
samples that are more severely degraded by bacteria will be greater
than 0.5, indicating mature organic matter characteristics.30 The nor-lupane/lupane value (or demethylated
effect) was often used as a parameter for degradation of organic matter
in decane samples, and the greater the value, the greater the degree
of degradation. In addition, the rate of mature conversion of sterane
C29-αααSS20 (S + R) values of low-mature samples
suffered from more serious bacterial degradation, which appears to
be delayed, that is, the C31-αβ-22S/22 (S + R) value of
hopane was significantly higher than the sterane C29-ααα-20S/20(S
+ R) value. The ratio of Ts to Tm was often used as the degradation degree of
the sample organic matter, and the smaller the value of the parameter Ts/Tm, the greater
the degree of degradation.31 This difference
in the hopane and sterane maturity parameters of the same low-evolution
sample was evidence that the sample has undergone bacterial degradation.32

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Materials
In order to observe the embedding status and whether the bacteria
can grow and reproduce well, a scanning electron microscope was used
to observe the synthesized microspheres, as shown in Figures 2 and 3. The structure of the microspheres after one and two weeks of degradation
was observed by scanning electron microscopy and the electron micrographs
at different times of one week. It can be clearly observed that the
inner structure of the immobilized pellets is cross-linked with each
other, and the pores are dense and uniform, showing a porous network
structure,33 which provides the microenvironment
for good growth of microbes inside. Both the surface void structure
and the internal skeleton structure indicated that there are sufficient
contact areas and opportunities for the growth of microbe substrates
in the interior, which is conducive to the transfer of nutrients.
Because of the large number of colonies adsorbed on the microspheres,
the uneven surface of the microspheres could be observed, which also
indicated that the experimental embedding materials had good adsorption
performance. At the same time, the electron microscope images of different
times after degradation for two weeks were observed. When degradation
reached the 14th day, the skeleton structure of the pellet broke down,
the void became larger and uneven, the pore wall became fragile, and
the collapse of the surface of the pellet began to appear. This is
because as the degradation time is lengthened, the prepared PAM–SA
hybrid gel gradually hydrolyzes, so that its internal structure was
destroyed and the surface collapses.

1000, and 2000 times of degradation in one week.

Figure 3 Electron
microscope images at 500, 1000, and 2000 times of degradation for
two weeks.

Determination of Crude
Oil Degradation Rate
As shown in Figure 4, the experimental group I degradation rate of about 70%, and the
experimental group II degradation rate is only 40%, and all is in
14 days after the degradation rate of the maximum, so the immobilized
microorganisms on the degradation of oil have been completed within
14 days.34 Degradation in the early stage
of 0–4 days, the experimental group II (3% concentration) crude
oil degradation rate is always higher than that of the experimental
group I (1% concentration) of crude oil; this may be due to the experimental group II initial
chain of the low carbon source for microbial degradation in than experimental
group I abundant reasons. On the 4th day, two experiments of the degradation rate is basically
the same, all around 24%, but 4 days later, experimental II degradation
rate increase slowly, in contrast, the experimental group I oil rate
growth speed, the results showed that the microbial degradation rate
of 3% crude oil was fast at the early stage and the aftereffect was
insufficient.

Figure 4 Saturated hydrocarbon degradation rate.

Determination of Degradation Rate of n-Alkane
The main component of crude oil is saturated hydrocarbon and the
total ion current is shown in Figure 5. The main components of saturated hydrocarbons are
alkanes C12–C35, including n-alkane series, iso-alkane series, and isoprene hydrocarbon series,
which account for 94.6% of saturated hydrocarbon fractions. The total
ion currents of the degraded petroleum hydrocarbons were analyzed
by GC–MS, and the total ion currents were found in Figures 6–8. According to the previous research
results and the GC–MS diagrams of 7 and 14 days of degradation,
it can be seen that the two experimental groups have the phenomenon
of “main peak carbon forward shift”. The results show that the immobilized microorganism can effectively
degrade saturated hydrocarbons with a high carbon number (Figure 9).

As shown above, the carbon number of n-alkanes was
distributed in C10–C38 after adding mixed
bacteria for 7 and 14 days, and the main peak carbon of n-alkanes moved forward obviously after the action of various kinds
of bacteria, which indicated that the bacteria had selectivity to n-alkanes with a high carbon number, and there is a strong
effect of demethylation. GC–MS data were used to calculate
the degradation rate of n-alkanes after 7 and 14
days. It can be seen from Figure 10 that the degradation rate of experimental group II
is higher than that of experimental group I in most carbon numbers
at the same time. Therefore, the degradation rate of n-alkanes in experimental group II (3% crude oil concentration) was
higher than that in experimental group I (1% crude oil concentration).

C37-n-tricabadecane; C38-n-tridecane.)

It can be seen from Figure 10 and Table 2, in general, the immobilized microbes of PAM materials have
obvious degradation effects on different concentrations of crude oil.
Especially for normal paraffin with a carbon number between 10 and
22, the degradation effect is remarkable. Among them, the degradation
rate of n-alkane in experimental group I (1% crude
oil concentration) is higher than that in experimental group II (3%
crude oil concentration), especially for the number of carbon atoms
in the 10–16 group I; the corresponding n-alkanes
was developed between the relative degradation rate is as high as
88.41%, while the experimental group II only 50.56%; similarly, the
relative degradation rate of 56.07% for the experimental group I of n-alkane with a carbon number between 17 and 22 is also
higher than that of the experimental group II of 23.67%. The difficulty
of degradation is as follows: low carbon number > medium carbon
number > high carbon number. From Figure 10, it can be observed that the lowest peaks
of both C17 and C18 appear. It can be concluded
that when degraded to seven days, both the experimental group I and
the experimental group II, the degradation rates of pristane and phytane
are preferentially maximized because pristane and phytane are the
most susceptible to degradation. Moreover, both experimental group
I and experimental group II had better degradation effects on 14 days
than on 7 days, and the degradation effect on the low carbon number
was obvious. Moreover, both experimental group I and experimental
group II had better degradation effects on 14 days than on 7 days,
and the degradation effect on the low carbon number was obvious substance,
so it is preferred to suffer from more intense bacterial degradation.

Analysis of Biological Evolution Parameters of n-Alkanes
It can be seen from the evolution parameters of n-alkanes in Table 3, 7d-1%-PAM main peak carbon is nC25, the 7d-3%-PAM main peak carbon advances to nC15, 14d-1%-PAM main peak carbon is nC29, the 14d-3%-PAM main peak carbon advances to nC20. The main peak carbon is obviously moving forward,
indicating that the microbial agent is selective for high carbon number n-alkanes and has a strong demethylation effect.35 The n-alkane distribution of
7d-1%-PAM is characterized by ∑C21– = ∑C22 + (w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+) = 1.000), but the distribution
of normal paraffins of 7d-3%-PAM is expressed as ∑C21– > ∑C22+ characteristics (w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+) = 1.729, and it indicated that the degradation degree
of 7d-3%-PAM was significantly greater than 7d-1%-PAM; similarly,
analyzing the values of w(∑C21–)/w(∑C22+) for 14d-1% and 3%,
the degree of degradation of 14d-3%-PAM was found to be significantly
greater than 14d-1%-PAM. The OEP values were 1.060, 1.075, 1.033,
and 1.075, respectively. In general, the value of experimental group
II was smaller than that of experimental group I, indicating that
the maturity of the latter was higher than that of the former (or
the latter was higher than the former). The values of pristine/phytane
were positive, indicating that the sample suffered from strong bacterial
degradation, and the values of the experimental group II was greater
than the experimental group I. It indicated that the oxidation of
the isoprenoids hydrocarbon in experimental group II was more obvious
than that in experimental group II.

As can be seen from Figure 11, PSM-immobilized microbial pellets have obvious degradation
effects on hopane compounds, and the degradation trends of hopane
in 7 and 14d were basically the same, indicating that the degradation
of hopane mainly showed the conversion of chiral carbon to stable
configuration, but the degradation rate of hopane was higher than
that of 14d at 7d. The degradation of hopane fluctuates significantly
because of the alternating appearance of the S and R configurations
of the series of substances. The bacterial action promotes the conversion
of the chiral carbon R configuration of the pentacyclic triterpenoids
to a more stable S configuration.36 The
type of compound is more stable, so the degradation rate is low, the
R configuration material is unstable, the degradation rate is high,
and the wavy degradation tendency is exhibited. As can be seen from Table 4, the magnitude of
the changes in the two groups of data is different, but the overall
trend is basically the same, and a comparative analysis can be performed.
The specific performance is as follows: the average degradation of
tricyclic diterpenoids is 0.792 μg, the relative degradation
rate reached 66.65%, which was much higher than the relative degradation
rate of 39.20% of the experimental group II. Regarding the relative degradation
rate of homohopane and norhopane, degradation of norhopane is slightly
inferior to that of homohopane; the overall degradation rate of experimental
group II is low, however, the degradation of tricycoloditerpane, homohopane,
and norhopane is consistent with that of experimental group I, that
is, the degree of degradation is as follows: tricycoloditerpane >
homohopane > norhopane.

As can be seen from Figure 12 and Table 5, the degradation effect of the steroids on the whole of the
experimental group I was better than that of the experimental group
II. Also, the relative degradation rate of the compound with C27 was 52.23%, the relative degradation rate of experimental
group II was only 20.81%; similarly, for compounds with C28 and C29, experimental group I also has obvious advantages.
From these two sets of data, it can be concluded that the degradation
degree of different carbon numbers of steroids with different carbon
atoms is as follows: C27 > C28 > C29.

Biological Evolution of Hopane and Sterane
From the
biological evolution parameters of Table 6, the four groups of parameters of hopane
C31αβ-22S/22S + R and sterane C29αα20S/20(S
+ R) were all greater than 0.4, that is, they are all strongly degraded
by microorganisms, the C31αβ-22S/22S + R parameter value
of hopane is greater than sterane C29αα20S/20(S + R),
it is fully demonstrated that the microbial degradation of hopane
is better than that of sterane. The nor-lupane/lupane value of 7d-1%-PAM
is 0.472, the nor-lupane/lupane value of 7d-3%-PAM is 0.529, which
indicates that the degradation degree of experimental group II is
greater than that of experimental group I. In general, the smaller
the Ts/Tm value,
the greater the microbial degradation intensity. The Ts/Tm values of the hopane
experimental group I at 7 and 14 days were 1.110 and 1.212, respectively,
both of which are less than the values 1.121 and 1.314 of the experimental
group II, and this proves that the overall degradation effect of the
experimental group I obtained above is better than that of the experimental
group II.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated the immobilization of four kinds of
mixed microorganism, which was prepared by uploading oil-degradation
bacteria into the cross-linked biodegradable PAM and SA mixture supporting
material, for efficient degradation of oily wastewater. The degradation
rate of saturated hydrocarbon TPH was studied by such immobilization
of microorganisms. The results show that the oil degradation rate
for experimental group I (sample containing 1% crude oil) and experimental
group II (sample containing 3% crude oil) reaches as high as 70 and
40%, respectively, after 14d of degradation of saturated hydrocarbon
TPH. For different oil components, the degradation degree is in the
order of tricycoloditerpanes > homohopanes > norhopanes. The
order of degradation degree of steroids with different carbon atoms
is C27 > C28 > C29. In terms of evolution characteristics, it
can be seen from the biological evolution parameters of n-alkanes that only a slight degradation for odd–even carbon
by biodegradable bacteria was achieved, whereas a high degradation
for isoprene alkanes was observed. According to the biological evolution
parameters of hopane and sterane, the hopane C31α β-22S/22S
+ R and sterane C29α α20S/20(S + R) were all greater than
0.4, that is, they are all strongly degraded by microorganisms. The
findings obtained from this work would be expected for providing useful
guidance for future optimization of mixed microorganism for TPH degradation.
Furthermore, the transformation characteristics of TPH were also investigated
to provide an insight into fundamental understanding of evolution
path for future study.
