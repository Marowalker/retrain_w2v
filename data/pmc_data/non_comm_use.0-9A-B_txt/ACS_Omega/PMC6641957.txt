Introduction
Heterocyclic moieties
are widely prevalent in bioactive natural
products as well as in the marketed pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
dyes, and many other application-oriented materials.1−5 Polyfunctionalized heterocycles, very particularly, occupy a dominating
position in the drug discovery process, and recently, it has been
estimated that approximately more than 70% of all enlisted pharmaceuticals
and agrochemicals bear at least one heterocyclic ring.6 Hence, research on the synthesis of polyfunctionalized
heterocyclic compounds has gained special attention. Among N-heterocycles,
pyrimidine and its derivatives have been studied for over a century
because of their varying chemical and biological significance;7,8 a good number of such heterocyclic scaffolds are reported for a
wide range of biological profiles including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
immunomodulating, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor activity.9−11 Categorically, barbituric/2-thiobarbituric acids, an important class
of pharmaceutically promising pyrimidine derivatives, find potential
applications as building blocks for a series of barbiturate/thiobarbiturate
drugs used as hypnotics, sedatives, anticonvulsants, anesthetics,
antioxidants, antifungal, and central nervous system depressants.12−14 Combination of barbituric/thiobarbituric acid moieties with other
pharmacophoric groups, thus, may offer a possibility to synthesize
numerous new types of other scaffolds with desired potential biological
effects. With this view, a large number of endeavors were undertaken
previously in fusing this important scaffold with other diverse molecular
skeletons such as 1,3-diketones,15,16 isatins,17−19 Meldrum’s acid,20 4-hydroxycoumarin,21 and many more under varying reaction conditions,
involving the use of catalysts and additives, organic solvents, heating/refluxing,
microwaves, electrolysis, and so forth.22

Again, chromenes and related O-heterocyclic derivatives are
a group
of biologically promising molecular frameworks commonly found in natural
and synthetic bioactive compounds exhibiting a broad spectrum of biological
activities.23 In addition to these two
N- and O-heterocyclic scaffolds, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (known
as lawsone), a major chemical constituent of the medicinal plant Lawsonia inermis Linn., has been evaluated to possess
many interesting biological and pharmacological activities so far,
which motivated our group to explore this useful scaffold in synthesizing
a series of novel bislawsone compounds with potent anticancer activity.24,25 However, available reports on the novel scaffold developments with
lawsone are still very limited.

Currently, molecular hybridization
(MH)26 is well-practiced in the process
of rational drug design based on
the recognition of pharmacophoric subunits in the molecular structure
of two or more known bioactive derivatives which, through an adequate
fusion of these subunits, leads to the design of new hybrid architectures
with extended pharmacological potential.27 Considering the success of MH techniques toward the design of various
lead candidates coupled with the proven pharmaceutical potential of
barbiturate/thiobarbiturate derivatives, functionalized chromenes,
and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (lawsone)-derived compounds, we felt
excitement whether all of these privileged scaffolds could be bound together within
one molecular framework so as to construct a novel series of polyfunctionalized
heterocyclic architectures by designing an efficient protocol that
would, at the same time, satisfy several green chemistry aspects.
It has been a major challenge of modern drug discovery, indeed, to
design highly efficient chemical reaction sequences that provide maximum
structural complexity and diversity with a minimum number of synthetic
steps to assemble compounds with interesting properties,28,29 and multicomponent reactions (MCRs) have recently been proven to
be an efficient and green method for the synthesis of structurally
diverse and complex organic compounds from simple starting materials
under one-pot condition with huge benefits, particularly in regard
to a facile automation, operational simplicity, and reduction in the
number of workup steps, thereby minimizing the extraction and purification
processes as well as waste generation and saving energy and manpower.30−38 In addition, designing for room-temperature conditions coupled with
other green aspects is also an area of current choice in synthetic
organic chemistry.39

From green chemistry
perspective, water is considered as a safe
and uniquely redox-stable green solvent which facilitates typical
solvation and molecular assembly processes, leading to the remarkable
modes of reactivity and selectivity of a wide variety of organic reactions.40−46 Apart from water, ethanol also already proved itself as a greener
solvent for organic syntheses and an alternative to toxic organic
solvents because of its solvation with most type of media and low
toxicity.47,48 Therefore, the combination of water and
ethanol is receiving considerable attention as an important green
solvent system in organic transformations with green procedure.49−55 Hence, the development of new synthesis methods keeping in view
of all such recent trends has become a new research direction, which
enables the simultaneous growth of both MCRs and green solvent systems
toward ideal organic synthesis in drug discovery and materials science.
As part of our ongoing research in the field of green synthesis,56−68 we herein wish to report a convenient, clean, facile, and catalyst-free
practical method for the synthesis of a new series of functionalized
5-aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones (4) from the one-pot MCR between barbituric acid/N,N-dimethylbarbituric acid/2-thiobarbituric acid
(1), aromatic aldehydes (2), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(3) in aqueous ethanol at ambient conditions (25–30
°C); the overall results are summarized in Scheme 1. The key advantages of this newly developed
protocol are the clean reaction profile, use of no catalyst and no
toxic organic solvents, mild reaction conditions at room temperature,
energy efficiency, use of commercially available low-cost starting
materials, no need of column chromatographic purification, high atom
economy (89.43–93.01%), and excellent yields.

5-Aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones (4)
Results and Discussion
On the basis of the critical survey of the literature on catalyst-free
organic transformations coupled with our own experience in performing
this kind of organic synthesis,69 we envisioned
that such a 1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold might be constructed out of a one-pot MCR of
its starting constituents such as barbituric acid, aldehyde, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
without the aid of any catalyst in the presence of a suitable solvent.
First, we checked our model reaction between barbituric acid (1-1; 1 equiv), benzaldehyde (2-1; 1 equiv), and
2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3; 1 equiv) in the absence
of any catalyst in aqueous medium under ambient conditions, thereby
isolating the desired compound, 5-phenyl-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-1), in 61% yield at 20 h (Table 1, entry 1). Then, we performed
the same reaction several times using either ethanol or ethanol–water
mixtures in varying proportions (v/v) as solvents or no solvent at
ambient conditions and observed that the reaction took place smoothly
in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v), affording the desired product 4-1 in 99% yield at 12 h (Table 1, entry 3). Compound 4-1 was
characterized by its analytical and spectral properties. The overall
results are summarized in Table 1.

b Isolated yields.

Under the optimized conditions,
we then carried out the reaction
between barbituric acid, 4-methylbenzaldehyde, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
and another reaction between barbituric acid, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde,
and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone; both the reactions furnished the
respective desired products, viz., 5-(p-tolyl)-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-2) (Table 2, entry 2) and 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-3) (Table 2, entry 3), in 98
and 97% yield, respectively, within 12–16 h. To check the generality
as well as the effectiveness of this newly developed protocol, a number
of aromatic aldehydes with varying functionalities such as bromo,
cyano, formyl, di- and trimethoxyls, and nitro were reacted with barbituric
acid and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone using identical reaction conditions;
all of these nine entries underwent the reaction smoothly, affording
the corresponding 5-aryl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones (4-4–4-12) (Table 2, entries 4–12) in excellent yields ranging
from 92 to 99% at room temperature within 12–20 h.

a Reaction Conditions: barbituric
acids (1; 0.5 mmol), aldehydes (2; 0.5 mmol),
and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3; 0.5 mmol) in 4 mL
of aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) at room temperature (25–30 °C)
in the absence of any catalyst.

b Isolated yields.

Inspired
by these results, we then replaced unsubstituted barbituric
acid with N,N-dimethylbarbituric
acid and carried out a similar set of three different reactions from
the mixture of this substituted barbituric acid (1 equiv) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(1 equiv), separately treating with benzaldehyde (1 equiv), 4-methylbenzaldehyde
(1 equiv), and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (1 equiv) in aqueous ethanol
(1:1 v/v) under the catalyst-free conditions just at room temperature.
To our delight, all three reactions produced the expected products,
1,3-dimethyl-5-phenyl-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-13), 1,3-dimethyl-5-(p-tolyl)-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone
(4-14), and 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dimethyl-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-15), in
97, 96, and 95% yield, respectively, within 16–20 h (Table 2, entries 13–15).
We then extended this methodology in synthesizing 11 more new 1,3-dimethyl-5-aryl-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone derivatives (4-16–4-25) (Table 2, entries
16–25) from the one-pot reaction of N,N-dimethylbarbituric acid (1; 1 equiv) with
a variety of functionalized aromatic aldehydes (2; 1
equiv) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3; 1 equiv)
using identical reaction conditions; all of them underwent the reaction
in a facile manner, affording the desired products 4-16–4-25 (Table 2, entries
16–25) with excellent yields ranging from 97 to 99% within
12–21 h. However, aliphatic aldehydes were found reluctant
to undergo the reaction; we observed that both butyraldehyde and isobutyraldehyde
upon treating separately with the mixture of 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
and barbituric acid/N,N-dimethylbarbituric
acid under the identical reaction conditions produced only the desired
products with 23–28% yield.

Encouraged by these results,
we then planned to replace barbituric
acid/N,N-dimethylbarbituric acid
with 2-thiobarbituric acid so as to further extend the newly developed
protocol in generating 2-thioxo-substituted analogues. For this purpose,
we performed the reaction between 2-thiobarbituric acid (1-26; 1 equiv), benzaldehyde (2-26; 1 equiv), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(3; 1 equiv) in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under the same
reaction conditions, and we were delighted to have the desired product,
5-phenyl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione (4-26) (Table 2, entry
26), in 96% yield at 20 h. We, furthermore, utilized the optimized
reaction conditions to synthesize a series of new 5-aryl-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione derivatives (4-27–4-36) (Table 2, entries 27–36)
from the one-pot reaction of 2-thiobarbituric acid (1; 1 equiv) with a varying range of aromatic aldehydes (2; 1 equiv) containing different functionalities such as bromo, cyano,
formyl, mono-, di-, and trimethoxyls, nitro, trifluoromethyl, and
so forth as substituents and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3; 1 equiv) in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) without the aid of any catalyst
under ambient conditions. All reactions were successfully completed,
furnishing the expected products 4-27–4-36 (Table 2, entries 27–36)
with excellent yields ranging from 87 to 98% within 16–22 h.
In addition, a heteroaryl aldehyde, furan-2-carbaldehyde (2-37), was also found to undergo the reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid
and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone under the identical reaction conditions
to produce 5-(furan-2-yl)-2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione (4-37) in 96% yield (Table 2, entry 37). The overall results
are summarized in Table 2.

With this successful background, we were motivated to study
the
present protocol whether capable to furnish the bis(2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione) scaffold upon reaction with biscarboxaldehyde
such as phthalaldehyde, isophthalaldehyde, and terephthalaldehyde.
Accordingly, we performed the reaction between biscarboxaldehyde (1
equiv), barbituric acid (2 equiv), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(2 equiv) in aqueous ethanol at ambient conditions and observed that
both phthalaldehyde and isophthalaldehyde did not undergo any reaction
(possibly because of the steric crowding), whereas terephthalaldehyde
produced the desired bis-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold (4′) satisfactorily.
To our delight, we were successful in synthesizing a set of three
such new compounds, namely, 5,5′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone) (4′-1), 5,5′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(1,3-dimethyl-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone) (4′-2), and 5,5′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(2-thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione) (4′-3), in 98, 92, and 94%
yield, respectively, within 18–22 h, using this methodology
(Table 3).

°C) in the absence of any catalyst.

b Isolated yields.

All products (4-1–4-37 and 4′-1–4′-3) were isolated pure just by washing with cold aqueous ethanol. All
isolated products were new and were fully characterized based on their
analytical data and detailed spectral studies including Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR), 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and distortionless
enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)-135.

We herein propose
a possible mechanism for the aqueous ethanol-mediated
one-pot synthesis of 5-aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones (4) from the three-component reaction
of barbituric acids (1), aromatic aldehydes (2), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3) in Scheme 2. For this purpose,
we monitored the pH of the reaction media for a representative entry
(entry 3, Table 2)
throughout the progress of the reaction and studied this reaction
based on the formation of possible condensation adducts as intermediates.
We successfully isolated and characterized (see Experimental
Section) the chalcone derivative, 5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (6-3), from the reaction of barbituric acid (1-3) and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2-3) in aqueous ethanol
(1:1 v/v) at ambient conditions, as an intermediate with 86% yield,
having the physical and spectral data in full agreement with those
reported in the literature.70 In the next
step, the isolated intermediate 6-3 produced the desired
product, 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-3), upon reaction with 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(3) under the same reaction conditions. In favor of our
proposition, we also carried out a similar reaction between 4-methoxybenzaldehyde
(2-3) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3) in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) under identical reaction conditions
and observed that the rate of this condensation reaction was too slow
and the reaction was not completed within a reasonable time frame
in comparison to the former case.

Ethanol-Mediated Three-Component
One-Pot Synthesis of Functionalized 5-Aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione 4 at Ambient Conditions
The results of pH monitoring
throughout the progress of this representative
entry 3 are quite logical with the proposed path—the mixture
of barbituric acid (1-3; 0.5 mmol) and 4-methoxybenzaldehyde
(2-3; 0.5 mmol) in aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v; 4 mL) recorded
a pH of 3.11, and under this acidic condition, a Claisen–Schmidt
condensation takes place between the enolic tautomer (1′) of barbituric acid and the protonated aldehyde (2)
to produce an aldol adduct 5 that eliminates one molecule
of water, resulting in the formation of a chalcone intermediate 6 (6-3 was isolated and characterized). In the
next step, 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (3) (0.5 mmol
of which recorded a pH of 3.92 in 4 mL of aqueous ethanol) undergoes
Michael addition with the chalcone intermediate 6 to
produce the nucleophilic adduct 7, which subsequently
takes part in a facile intramolecular ring closure via a 6-exo-trig
process, generating the cycloadduct 8 that eventually
furnishes the desired product 4 upon the elimination
of water as a green waste (Scheme 2).

It is worth noting that we successfully reused
the reaction media
containing the residual solvent and substrates obtained upon the filtration
of the reaction mixture after the completion of the reaction up to
the fourth run in the case of a representative entry (Table 2, entry 3), viz., reaction between
barbituric acid, 4-methoxybenzaldehyde, and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone.
The desired product, 5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4,6,11(3H,5H)-tetraone (4-3), was isolated in almost identical yields
(96–98%) in all runs. We also examined the feasibility of the
present method for a slightly scaled-up (on the gram scale; 10 mmol
scale) experiment with the same entry (Table 2, entry 3) at room temperature in ethanol–water
(20 mL; 1:1 v/v): the reaction was found to proceed smoothly, affording
the desired product 4-3 in 96% isolated yield, and the
product yield of this large-scale reaction is almost similar to that
of the 0.5 mmol scale entry (Table 2, entry 3) in terms of yield and time. This experiment
demonstrated the applicability of this catalyst-free room-temperature
protocol for large-scale productions as well.

We evaluated the
green chemistry credentials of this newly developed
one-pot synthesis protocol by performing a series of green metrics
calculations71−82 such as effective mass yield (EMY), atom economy (AE), atom efficiency
(AEf), carbon efficiency (CE), reaction mass efficiency (RME), optimum
efficiency (OE), mass productivity (MP), mass intensity (MI) and process
mass intensity (PMI), E-factor, solvent intensity
(SI), and water intensity (WI) for all synthesized compounds 4 (4-1–4-37) and 4′ (4′-1–4′-3) (see the Supporting Information). The calculated AE and
AEf for the method range from 89.43 to 93.01% and from 80.53 to 92.08%,
respectively, and are less than 100% because of the formation of H2O as the byproduct. The calculated CE (79.60–99.00%)
for this process is also quite good. As the RME includes all reactant
mass, yield, and AE, it is the most useful metric to determine the
greenness of a process. Calculations of EMY (83.83–91.86%)
and RME (80.58–92.22%) also indicate the excellent green credential
of the present method. Similarly, the evaluations of MI (7.32–10.15
g/g) and PMI (31.64–41.14 g/g) parameters also corroborate
this fact. The calculated E-factors ranging from
0.09 to 0.19 are found to be very much supportive for the greenness
of the present method. The other green parameters have also been found
to be in order. Working formulas for green metrics, their calculations,
and respective data for all entries are documented in the Supporting Information; Tables 4 and 5 offer such
data for three representative entries.

Conclusions
A
simple, catalyst-free, energy-efficient, and conveniently practical
method for easy access to a huge range of biologically interesting
diverse and functionalized 5-aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones 4 (4-1–4-37)
and substituted 5,5′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-trione) derivatives 4′ (4′-1–4′-3) has been developed from the one-pot MCR between barbituric/2-thiobarbituric
acids (1), aromatic aldehydes (2), and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(3) in aqueous ethanol at room temperature. The salient
features of this present protocol include mild reaction conditions
at room temperature, avoidance of catalyst, operational simplicity
and clean reaction profiles, and excellent yields with high atom economy.
In addition, the use of commercially available inexpensive starting
materials and the ease of product isolation/purification without the
aid of tedious column chromatography are added advantages of this
present method, thereby satisfying the triple bottom line philosophy
of green and sustainable chemistry.83 In
addition, the reusability of the reaction media and the quite successful
operation in gram-scale synthesis offer added advantages to this protocol.
The present method satisfies green credentials at the best. Considering
the synthetic importance of such biologically relevant multi-heterocentric
organic scaffolds, the present catalyst-free green methodology with
operational simplicity may thus also afford cost-effective and environmentally
friendlier ways for large-scale syntheses of these useful molecules.

Experimental
Section
General Considerations
Infrared spectra were recorded
using a Shimadzu (FT-IR 8400S) FT-IR spectrophotometer using a KBr
disk. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were collected
at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, on a Bruker DRX spectrometer using
CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 as solvents.
Elemental analyses were performed with an Elementar Vario EL III Carlo
Erba 1108 microanalyzer instrument. Melting point was recorded on
a Chemiline CL-725 melting point apparatus and was uncorrected. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed using silica gel 60 F254 (Merck) plates.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Functionalized
5-Aryl-2-oxo-/thioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[6,7]chromeno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,6,11(5H)-triones 4
A magnetic stir bar,
barbituric/2-thiobarbituric acid (1; 0.5 mmol), aromatic
aldehyde (2; 0.5 mmol), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone
(3; 0.5 mmol), and 4 mL of aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v)
were transferred to an oven-dried reaction tube in a sequential manner
at ambient conditions, and the reaction mixture was then stirred vigorously
for a stipulated time frame (12–22 h). The progress of the
reaction was monitored by TLC. Upon the completion of the reaction,
a solid mass precipitated out and was filtered off, followed by the
purification of the crude product just by washing with cold aqueous
ethanol. The structure of each purified compound was confirmed by
analytical as well as spectral studies including FT-IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and DEPT-135.

Isolation
and Characterization of a Representative Chalcone
Intermediate (Benzylidene Barbituric Acid) 6-3
An oven-dried sealed tube was charged with a magnetic stir bar, barbituric
acid (1-3; 0.5 mmol), 4-methoxybenzaldehyde (2-3; 0.5 mmol), and 4 mL of aqueous ethanol (1:1 v/v) in a sequential
manner at ambient conditions, and the reaction mixture was then stirred
for 5 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. Upon the
completion of the reaction, a yellow solid mass precipitated out,
was filtered off, and was washed with cold aqueous ethanol to obtain
pure 5-(4-methoxybenzylidene)pyrimidine-2,4,6(1H,3H,5H)-trione (6-3) having
the physical and spectral data in full agreement with those reported
in the literature.70
