The
physicochemical and hydration properties of mechanically modified
flax fibers (FFs) were investigated herein. Raw flax fibers (FF-R)
were ball-milled and sieved through mesh with various aperture sizes
(420, 210, and 125 μm) to achieve modified samples, denoted
as FF-420, FF-210, and FF-125, respectively. The physicochemical and
hydration properties of FF-R with variable particle sizes were characterized
using several complementary techniques: microscopy (SEM), spectroscopy
(FT-IR, XRD, and XPS), thermoanalytical methods (DSC and TGA), adsorption
isotherms using gas/dye probes, and solvent swelling studies in liquid
H2O. The hydration of FF biomass is governed by the micropore
structure and availability of active surface sites, as revealed by
the adsorption isotherm results and the TGA/DSC profiles of the hydrated
samples. Gravimetric water swelling, water retention values, and vapor
adsorption results provide further support that particle size reduction
of FF-R upon milling parallels the changes in surface chemical and
physicochemical properties relevant to adsorption/hydration in the
modified FF materials. This study outlines a facile strategy for the
valorization and tuning of the physicochemical properties of agricultural
FF biomass via mechanical treatment for diverse applications in biomedicine,
energy recovery, food, and biosorbents for environmental remediation.

1 Introduction
The
hydration properties of biomaterials occupy a key role in their
physical, chemical, and microbiological attributes.1 In particular, the role of water activity and moisture
adsorption/desorption processes form the basis of a wide range of
applications in food processing, materials science, and advanced polymer
technology.2 Thus, a better understanding
of solute–water interactions is required for the rational design
of advanced materials, such as desiccants, humectants, and adsorbents,
for energy harvesting, food preservation, and environmental remediation.
Natural fiber-based composites are gaining greater interest in the
fields of energy, food, and polymer technology because of their environmental
sustainability, eco-friendly nature, and favorable mechanical strength
and performance.2,3 The continued interest in the
use of natural flax fiber (FF) in biocomposites over traditional reinforcing
materials (e.g., glass fiber, talc, and mica) relates to its low cost,
low density, high mechanical strength, and biodegradability.4 However, the hydrophilic nature and lack of good
interfacial adhesion of natural flax limit its use in composites because
of degradation of its mechanical properties upon swelling in water.
The hydrophile–lipophile balance (HLB) of natural flax can
be tuned by substituting the surface hydroxyl (−OH) groups
via such reactions as acetylation, benzoylation, and peroxide treatment.5,6 Consequently, the water affinity of natural fibers is reduced, whereas
their compatibility with apolar polymer matrices is enhanced.7 The chemical treatment of flax affords changes
in the surface properties of the material, owing to changes in the
relative biomass composition. Changes in surface properties are usually
accompanied by changes in the surface morphology and textural properties.8 More recently, research on natural flax has focused
on its water uptake properties.7,9 By contrast, the uptake
properties of natural FFs with water vapor have been more actively
studied because of their unique hydration properties and relevant
applications to the textile industry.10−12 Recently, advanced applications
of fibers have emerged that utilize hydration phenomena, such as those
related to the biomedical field (e.g., wound dressing),13,14 biosorbents for environmental remediation (oil, dyes, and heavy
metals),15,16 energy harvesting in heat, ventilation,
and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems and food-based products.2 In particular, recent reports have detailed comprehensive
reviews on the removal of metals, dyes, and other organic contaminants
using biomaterials and their modified forms as versatile sorbents.17,18

Biopolymer hydration is ubiquitous to many chemical processes
and
stabilization of biological structures.19−21 Theoretical and experimental
techniques have been employed to investigate the hydration properties
of biopolymers.20,22 For example, single-crystal X-ray
diffraction techniques and high-resolution NMR spectroscopy have provided
unique insight into biopolymer hydration phenomena.20,22 More recently, new insight into surface-mediated hydration processes
was obtained using complementary material characterization studies:
spectroscopy, thermal analyses, solvent uptake, and adsorption isotherm
methods. Recent studies23,24 on the hydration of
starch- and cellulose-based materials in mixed solvent systems reveal
that the relative biopolymer–solvent affinity depends on various
physicochemical properties: (1) HLB of the biopolymer, (2) relative
polarity of the biopolymer–solvent system, (3) textural [surface
area (SA) and pore structure] properties, and (4) solvent properties
such as relative polarity and molar volume. The ability of natural
FFs to adsorb water relates to the presence of abundant polar functional
groups (−OH and COOH) that characterize surface adsorption
sites. The cell wall of a plant fiber is considered to be a natural
composite that consists of crystalline microfibrils embedded in an
amorphous lignin–hemicellulose–pectin matrix.9,25 The variable composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and
lignin imparts a variable HLB character to the composite structure
of FFs because of the variable amorphous nature and abundance of the
functional groups.9 Independent studies
report the composition of raw flax biomass as ∼70% cellulose,
18% hemicellulose, 2% pectins, 2% lignins, and ∼1.7% oil/waxes.
The respective components of flax contribute differentially to the
water uptake properties because of the variable level and accessibility
of surface functional groups.26 Also, the
overall composition of the FFs likely varies upon chemical and/or
mechanical treatment because of changes in surface accessibility.
Thus, it can be concluded that chemical and/or mechanical treatment
of natural FFs afford structurally modified materials with tunable
physicochemical properties for tailored applications, in accordance
with numerous literature reports.25−28 Despite extensive research on
the relationship between water sorption and the role of particle size
in the surface and textural properties of ball milled/ground flax,
there are limited studies that report on the hydration properties
of these modified materials.

Herein, various complementary techniques
were used to study the
physicochemical and hydration properties of natural flax in its pristine
and mechanically modified forms: spectroscopy [Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)],
thermoanalytical (differential scanning calorimetry, DSC; thermogravimetric
analysis, TGA), and sorption methods (g/l adsorption isotherms and
solvent swelling). Modified FFs were prepared via ball milling, where
the ball-milled raw FF (FF-R) was sieved using various mesh sizes
with variable apertures (425, 210, and 125 μm) to prepare FF-420,
-210, and -125 materials, respectively. The objectives of this study
are (1) to characterize the physicochemical properties of natural
raw flax with variable particle sizes modified via ball milling and
sieving, (2) to investigate the water (g/l) uptake properties of the
raw and modified materials, and (3) to gain insight into the structure–adsorption
relationship for FF biomass and its hydration properties. Herein,
we demonstrate that the hydration and water-swelling/retention properties
of the pristine (FF-R) and modified (FF-420, -210, and -125) FFs vary
markedly, in agreement with the variable textural (surface and pore
structure) properties of the materials. The results of this study
are likely to contribute to valorization of flax using a facile milling
approach to modify the biomass structure, along with tailoring of
the biomass properties. The results of this study are likely to have
practical utility because of the ubiquitous importance of hydration
phenomena and emerging fiber-based technologies in medicine, energy,
food, textiles,30,31 and environmental remediation.32

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Chemicals
The FF-R
material was procured from Biolin Research Inc. (Saskatoon, SK, Canada).
Spectroscopic-grade potassium bromide (KBr) and wire mesh sieves [USA
standard sieves; no. 40 (420 μm), no. 70 (210 μm), and
no. 120 (125 μm)] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (ON, Canada).

2.2 Modification of the Raw Flax
Mechanically
modified FF materials were processed by ball milling and rotary grinding
of FF-R. Ball milling was achieved by mixing the raw flax material
with ZrO2 balls (6–10 mm in diameter) in a stainless
steel milling jar with a weight ratio of 1:10. The rotation speed
of the disk and milling jar was set to 450 rpm, where the milling
jar was rotated alternately in the forward and reverse directions
at intervals of 2 min. The ball-milled FF samples were further ground
in a rotary coffee grinder and sieved using variable mesh sizes (no.
40, 70, and 120) to achieve FF samples denoted as FF-420, FF-210,
and FF-125, respectively. The raw flax sample (FF-R) and the mechanically
modified samples (FF-420, -210, and -125) were characterized using
complementary techniques, as described below.

2.3 Surface
and Textural Characterization of the
FF Materials
2.3.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
SEM
images were obtained using FEG-SEM SU6600 instruments at an accelerating
voltage of 15 kV, using low (30×) and high (1.5k×) magnification.

2.3.2 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS
measurements were carried out using a Kratos (Manchester, UK)
AXIS Supra system. All survey scan spectra were collected in the 5–1200
binding energy range in 1 eV steps with a pass energy of 160 eV. High-resolution
spectra were also conducted using 0.05 eV steps with a pass energy
of 20 eV. An accelerating voltage of 15 eV and an emission current
of 15 mA were used for data collection.

2.3.3 X-ray
Diffraction
XRD patterns
of the FF-R and modified forms were recorded with a PANalytical Empyrean
powder X-ray diffractometer. Monochromatic Co Kα1 radiation
was used while the applied voltage and current were set to 40 kV and
45 mA, respectively. The FF films were mounted in a horizontal configuration
after evaporation of methanol. The XRD patterns were measured in the
continuous mode over a 2θ range (7–50°) with a scan
rate of 3.2° min–1.

2.3.4 FT-IR
Spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra
of the FF samples were recorded using a BIO-RAD FTS-40 spectrophotometer
operating in the diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) mode. The samples (ca.
10 mg) were mixed with spectroscopic-grade KBr (ca. 90 mg) using a
spatula with minimum grinding to maintain the particle size and integrity
of the samples. A total of 132 scans were acquired for each sample
for a spectral region of 400–4000 cm–1 with
a resolution of 4 cm–1.

2.3.5 Nitrogen
Adsorption Isotherms
The
SA and pore structure properties of the raw and modified samples were
measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 (Norcross, GA) with an accuracy
of ±5% and calibrated using alumina (Micromeritics) with a known
pore volume (PV) and SA. Each sample (1 g) was degassed at an evacuation
rate of 5 mmHg s–1 at 100 °C for 48 h. The
micropore SA was estimated using a t-plot (de Boer
method), whereas the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method
was employed to estimate the PV and pore diameter (PD) from the adsorption
isotherm using the Kelvin equation.33

2.4 Hydration and Sorption Properties
2.4.1 Dye Adsorption Kinetics
The sorption
uptake kinetics of the FF-R and mechanically modified samples (FF-420,
-210, and -125) were measured using a one-pot kinetic method,34 where the uptake of a chromophore dye probe
(methylene blue; MB) was measured as a function of time. Briefly,
the FF adsorbents (ca. 120 mg) were added into dialysis bags that
were previously equilibrated in water. The fiber sample was enclosed
by clipping both ends of the dialysis bag in a manner analogous to
a tea sachet. The adsorbents were immersed in a beaker containing
ca. 150 mL of 10 μM MB aqueous solution, equipped with a Teflon
stirrer bar, with mixing at ∼150 rpm. Aliquots of solution
(∼2.6 mL) were taken at variable time intervals during continuous
stirring, where the equilibrium dye concentration was measured by
UV–vis spectrophotometry (Varian CARY 100). The temporal uptake
(Qt) was plotted as a function of time
(h) according to a method detailed elsewhere.34

2.4.2 Thermogravimetric Analysis and Differential
scanning calorimetry
TGA (Q50 TA Instruments) of the flax
samples was performed with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 from 30 to 500 °C, under a N2 purge gas. Solid samples
were analyzed in the dry and wet states in aluminum pans, where the
samples weights were fixed at 20 ± 0.2 mg. The sample dosage
in Millipore water was 10% (w/w). The integration of the thermal events
in the TGA profile was measured using the TA Q50 software.

Differential
scanning calorimetry (TA, Q20 TA Analyzer) of the raw and modified
flax materials was performed between 30 and 150 °C at a scan
rate set to 10 °C/min. Solid samples (5 ± 0.5 mg) were analyzed
using hermetically sealed aluminum pans, and nitrogen gas was used
to regulate the sample temperature and sample compartment purging.

2.4.3 Water Swelling and Water Retention Value
The various FF materials were evaluated for their uptake of water
at equilibrium in order to estimate the degree of solvent swelling
in liquid water. Dry FF samples (ca. 20 mg) were equilibrated in 7
mL of Millipore water for 48 h. The degree of swelling (Sw) was calculated using eq 1 1  Ws refers
to the
wet sample and Wd refers to the dry sample
after oven drying to a constant weight (±0.1 g) at 60 °C.

The water retention value (WRV) was evaluated by equilibrating
40 mg of each sample in de-ionized water for 1 h, followed by centrifugation
(Precision Scientific Co.) at 4000 rpm for 1 h to separate the solid
from the liquid water. The hydrated solid sample was weighed (w1), followed by drying in a conventional oven
at 105 °C. Finally, the sample was placed in a desiccator to
cool for 12 h and weighed again (w2).
Each measurement was carried out in triplicate and the WRVs (%WRV)
were estimated using eq 2, where W1 (g) and W2 (g) are the weights of the wet and dry samples, respectively. 2  

2.4.4 Water Vapor Analysis
The water
vapor adsorption isotherms were obtained using the Intelligent Gravimetric
Analyzer system (IGA-002, Hiden Isochema, UK). Sample weights of ca.
30 mg were placed in a stainless steel container that were housed
in a vessel equipped with a microbalance, a thermostat, and ultrahigh
vacuum capability. Prior to the start of the isotherm measurements,
samples were degassed at 70 °C and 10–8 mbar
for 6 h, where the desired temperature inside the vessel was controlled
accurately using an external water bath. The vapor adsorption isotherms
were obtained at 25 °C for a range of pressures from 0 to 30
mbar with 5 mbar increments.

3 Results
and Discussion
The milling of FF-R led to the preparation
of mechanically modified
biomass according to the particle size and SA. On the basis of previous
reports,4,5,25,35 it can be inferred that changes in the textural properties
are accompanied by variations in the surface chemical properties.
These effects are posited to have a direct impact on the hydration
phenomena of the various FF samples. To gain insight into the role
of mechanical treatment in the physicochemical and hydration properties
of FF-R samples, complementary techniques were used to characterize
the structure and physicochemical properties of the raw and treated
FFs, as outlined in the sections below.

3.1 Textural
and Surface Properties
The
surface morphology of the raw and chemically modified FFs was characterized
using SEM. In Figure 1, the SEM micrographs of the FF-R reveal long strands with fibrous
features, along with an incremental reduction in the mean particle
size upon mechanical treatment, as noted for FF-420, -210, and -125
samples. A previous report25 for biomass
materials indicate that a reduction in particle size occurs upon grinding,
along with concomitant changes in the physical properties and chemical
composition. These changes are accompanied by a reduced degree of
polymerization, reduced crystallinity, and greater accessibility of
surface functional groups.25 The SEM images
provide support of the disintegration of the waxy or organophilic
layers that are present in the raw fiber sample, as evidenced in Figure 1.

Figure 1 SEM micrographs of FF-R
and the modified materials: FF-420, FF-210,
and FF-125, obtained at low (30×) and high (1.5k×) magnification.

Nitrogen adsorption isotherms provide characterization
of the surface
and textural properties of the flax biomass. In particular, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) model affords estimates of the textural properties: SA, pore
width (PW), and pore volume (PV) parameters that can provide insight
into the structure–function relationship of such biomass. Figure 2 shows the N2 adsorption isotherms for FF-R and the mechanically treated
materials (FF-420 and -210) and reveal that the modified and unmodified
materials have limited porosity and SA. The isotherm results for the
FF-125 sample are not reported herein because of instability during
sample degassing for such fine particle sizes. However, the main nitrogen
uptake event in the adsorption profile relates to the adsorption at
the powder grain interface, according to the pronounced uptake at
relative pressures (P/P0) near unity. The corresponding SA and pore structure parameters
of the raw and milled fiber materials are relatively low, as listed
in Table 1. In general,
all the flax materials show very small SA (∼1 m2/g) that is characteristic of nonporous fibril materials,23,24 with negligible pore volumes ranging ∼0.35 to 1.3 ×
10–4 cm3/g (cf. Table 1). Although the PV is measurably smaller,
it is marginally higher for the modified materials, where values are
ca. 3- to 4-fold greater. The specific SA of the modified flax decreases
with increasing pore structure, which may relate to the fiber geometry
of the ground samples.36 The increased
hysteresis loop in the desorption profiles of the modified materials
in Figure 2 relates
to the effect of capillary condensation. The results are consistent
with the greater pore structure accessibility, in agreement with the
PV data.37

The crystallinity of the FF materials
was estimated from the PXRD
results shown in Figure 3. The XRD profiles reveal that the crystallinity of the FF-R material
(fwhm ≈ 2.0) decreases upon modification (fwhm > 2.4) and
follows
the trend FF-R < FF-420 < FF-210 < FF-125, according to changes
in linewidth and intensity of the cellulose I reflections at θ
≈ 15 and 22°.25 These trends
are understood in terms of the changes in the macromolecular structure
of the biopolymers upon rupture of intermolecular bonds during grinding
that leads to enriched content of the noncrystalline fraction of cellulose,
in accordance with greater fibrillation upon milling of the biomass.38 A greater proportion of amorphous cellulose
has been reported for biomass through mercerization of natural fibers
via alkali treatment because of disruption of the hydrogen bonding
network of the biopolymer.27,28

Figure 3 X-ray diffraction spectra
of the raw and mechanically modified
FF samples.

The surface composition of the
raw and ground FFs provides an account
of the structural modification upon mechanical treatment of the samples.
FT-IR and XPS are sensitive spectral techniques that can be used to
characterize the surface chemistry of biopolymer and inorganic composites.39,40 Previous reports41,42 reveal that specific components
of cellulosic fibers were studied using DRIFT and attenuated total
reflection (ATR) methods, where the relative intensities of key spectral
signatures were used to estimate the proportion of the respective
fiber components. In Figure 4a, the various IR bands were assigned according to established
reports:35,41,43 ∼2900
cm–1 (C–H stretching), ∼1700 cm–1 (C=O carboxylic acid or ester stretching band
for hemicellulose), and ∼1615 cm–1 (pectins).
In an ATR characterization study of FFs by Garside and Wyeth,42 the IR band ∼1600 cm–1 was assigned to adsorbed water and the signature ∼1430 cm–1 corresponds to the C=C in-plane aromatic vibrations
of lignins.41,42 In general, a greater spectral
intensity of the IR bands at ca. 1735 and 1615 cm–1 for the mechanically modified FF samples provides support that a
greater proportion of hemicellulose and pectin fraction reside at
the treated biomass surface. It is inferred that reduction of particle
sizes for the FF materials occurs upon milling, where the exposure
of fresh biomass surface sites is accompanied by alteration of physicochemical
properties relevant to sorption processes (e.g., surface charge, chemical
functionality, and porosity). The surface accessible functional groups
in the modified materials are likely altered upon milling, along with
a reduction in the molecular weight because of changes in the biomass
particle size and fiber morphology. The flax biomass is posited to
become more amorphous with greater structural defects upon mechanical
treatment, in agreement with the SEM and PXRD results. Consequently,
the greater abundance of the surface functional groups (e.g., −C=O
and −OH) is evidenced by the FT-IR results. In addition, XPS
was used to study the surface composition of the FFs according to
variable levels of mechanical milling.

Figure 4 (a) FT-IR and (b) XPS
spectra of the raw and mechanically modified
FF samples. The expanded bonding energy region for N 1s ca. 400 eV
is shown as an inset.

The survey profiles (cf. Figure 4b) of the XPS data
for the raw (FF-R) and the mechanically
modified fibers (FF-420, -210, and -125) show unique spectral signatures
at bond energies ∼285 (C 1s; 75–85%), 532 (O 1s; 16–24%),
and 400 eV (N 1s; 1–2%). It is noteworthy that the N 1s region
was not observed for the FF-R sample, as shown in Figure 4b, and a summary of spectral
signatures for the convoluted XPS bands is shown in Table 2. In general, the C 1s spectra
of the fiber materials were deconvoluted into three bonding states:
C1 ≈ 285 eV (C–C/C–H), C2 ≈ 286 eV (C–OH/C–O), and C3 ≈
288 eV (C=O), where the latter was of lesser abundance (cf.
Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
Similarly, the O 1s spectra were deconvoluted as two bonding states:
O1 at ∼531 eV and O2 ∼532 eV.
It is noteworthy that the bond energies corresponding to the N 1s
region are associated with proteins (amides) that are observed solely
for the modified fibers. It is noteworthy that the amide (R–NH–C=O)
spectral band can be deconvoluted into various contributions because
of N 1s (∼400 eV), O 1s (∼531 eV), and C 1s (∼288
and 286 eV) regions,44,45 in agreement with the results
shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The foregoing suggests that mechanically modified fibers have greater
abundance of functional groups that become exposed upon milling because
of the removal of the waxy surface layer. Furthermore, some of the
O 1s bond energies are associated with absorbed water onto the fiber
surface sites,44 in agreement with the
FT-IR results presented above.

3.2 Fiber
Hydration Properties
The physicochemical
properties of biomaterials influence their hydration state and water
adsorption properties from the vapor and in liquid-phase media. The
results described above reveal that mechanical milling results in
structural changes: reduced crystallinity and the relative abundance/accessibility
of the surface functional groups and pore domains. Hydration properties
of flax encompass biomass-solvent (water) affinity via surface interactions
(e.g., hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and ion–dipole or dipole–dipole
interactions), according to the surface chemical and textural properties.
Thus, the dye adsorption properties of FFs under kinetic conditions
provide an estimate of the surface accessible functional groups. In Figure 5, the kinetics of
methylene blue (MB) dye uptake among the various FF samples adopt
the following trend: FF-125 ≥ FF-210 > FF-420 > FF-R.
The faster
dye uptake kinetics relate to samples with greater surface area due
to the greater abundance of surface functional groups and the enhanced
microporous nature of the material, as supported by SEM, XPS, and
FT-IR results. In contrast, the raw material (FF-R) is characterized
by a biomass surface with limited functional groups and porosity.
Similar kinetic profiles for the FF-R and FF-420 samples at t ≤ 1 h indicate that the structures of these samples
are similar, in agreement with their similar pore structure and surface
properties estimated from the N2 uptake isotherms, as shown
in Table 1. The increased
kinetics for the FF-420 sample at t > 1 h relative
to the FF-R sample indicate an improved accessibility of the micropore
structure of the milled samples, where diffusion of the dye is greater
and adsorption within the pore domains prevails at longer time intervals.
The relative hydration state of the flax biomass can be inferred from
the kinetic dye uptake results shown in Figure 5 because of the hydrophilic nature of MB
and its affinity to the polar heteroatom sites of the fiber surface.46 A study of FF materials immersed in liquid water
(and with water vapor) under equilibrium conditions is presented to
afford a complementary understanding of the role of sorption in the
hydration properties (vide infra) of this biomass.

mechanical milling under kinetic conditions at ambient temperature
and pH.

3.2.1 TGA of Dry and Hydrated
FFs
In
spite of the structural complexity of bound water at biopolymer surfaces,
thermoanalytical (DSC and TGA) methods and spectroscopic (NMR, FT-IR,
and Raman) techniques provide useful information about the molecular
level details of hydration phenomena for biopolymer-solvent systems.23,24 In the case of DSC and TGA, unique thermal profiles of free and
bound (weak vs strong) water provide complementary insight into biopolymer
hydration. The DSC profiles of the raw and milled materials are shown
in Figure 6a, where
the DSC traces reveal broader dehydration transitions at higher temperature
for the modified FF samples versus FF-R. The broader transitions for
the milled samples suggest that the bound water exists in an ensemble
of micro-environments that concurs with the amorphous nature of the
biomass, in agreement with the PXRD results. Despite the reduced crystallinity
of the ground samples, the appearance of the DSC profiles at higher
temperatures is more evident for the FF-125 sample. These results
provide support that the milled biomass samples have greater hydrophilicity
upon mechanical treatment that affords greater accessibility of the
surface functional groups, as supported by the FT-IR and XPS results.
The biomass hydration properties are governed by several factors:
(1) surface accessibility of functional groups, (2) greater SA and
pore structure that favor water sorption, and (3) suitable functional
groups that favor biomass–water interactions. The greater fwhm/peak
areas of the modified samples in the DSC profiles indicate that the
fiber materials have greater affinity for water because of enhanced
textural and surface functional properties, consistent with the greater
change in dehydration enthalpy (ΔHdeh) which concurs with the SEM, PXRD, and nitrogen adsorption results.

DSC thermograms of hydrated biomass in H2O (l) at equilibrium
and (b) TGA spectra of hydrated samples at equilibrium and in the
dry state.

Similar to the DSC results, the
TGA profiles in Figure 6b indicate that greater weight
loss occurs for the wet/dry milled materials (FF-R > FF-420 >
FF-210
> FF-125) because of dehydration effects. The results indicate
that
the FF-125 sample has the greatest water binding affinity, in agreement
with its greater hydrophilic character, as supported by the DSC and
XPS results. In general, the thermal degradation of lignocellulosic
natural fibers involves several thermal events:47 release of bound water (50–150 °C), degradation/depolymerization
of hemicellulose (250–370 °C), and degradation of α-cellulose
(340–370 °C) and lignins (200–500 °C). The
additional event at ∼300 °C for the milled samples in
the dry state supports that the presence of greater fractions of hemicellulose/pectin
occur at the surface of the treated biomass, in agreement with FT-IR
results. It is noteworthy that the dry FF-R sample decomposes at a
slightly higher temperature according to the TGA results because milling
is inferred to degrade the biomass assembly. This trend occurs according
to the lower decomposition temperatures of FF-420, -210, and -125
samples.48 It is noteworthy that the diminishing
trend in the weight losses occur because of the decomposition of the
FFs ∼300–350 °C in the wet state, as observed in Figure 6b. The greater hydration
of the mechanically modified biomass contributes to the disruption
of intermolecular H bonding that results in a reduced decomposition
temperature (cf. Figure 6b).24

3.2.2 Water
Swelling and Retention Values
The thermogravimetric profiles
described above were complemented
by gravimetric swelling of the FF biomass in water in order to assess
the ability of the flax biomass to retain sorbed water (Figure 7). The greater swelling and
WRVs in Figure 7 (FF-125
> FF-210 > FF-420 > FF-R) reveal unique trends that parallel
the greater
hydrophilicity and hydration of the modified materials. These observations
corroborate the DSC/TGA results, where parallel trends are noted for
the greater surface/textural properties and amorphous nature of the
modified FF samples. Also, this trend is supported by the XPS, SEM,
gas/dye adsorption, and PXRD results. According to the DSC/TGA results,
the FF-125 sample was characterized by tightly bound water in contrast
to the weakly bound water for the FF-R sample. The thermal analysis
results are further supported by the WRV results shown in Figure 7. The greater swelling
of the mechanically modified flax materials indicates that the crystallinity
of the biomass fiber structure affects the water uptake and hydration
properties, in agreement with the greater amorphous (fibrillated)
nature of the milled samples.49 As indicated,
the modification of FFs by milling attenuates the specific SA (cf. Table 1).

Figure 7 Gravimetric solvent (water)
swelling and WRVs of pristine and modified
FFs.

However, solvent swelling in water
is anticipated to result in
a marked increase in the “apparent” SA because of hydration-induced
structural changes in the biomass.50 Adsorption
studies of the various flax materials in the presence of water vapor
provide further insights into the hydration properties. As such, hydration
properties are of key importance to applications for adsorption-based
energy wheels in HVAC systems.

The vapor adsorption isotherms
and the related adsorption parameters
are listed in Table 3, based on results presented in Figure 8. In general, the S-shaped isotherms shown
in Figure 8 correspond
to the classification system described by the BET model that describe
trends noted for cellulose-based hydrophilic materials.7 The greater moisture capacity for the milled
FFs are higher: FF-420 (Qm ≈ 4.92
g/g), FF-210 (Qm ≈ 5.26 g/g), and
FF-125 (Qm ≈ 5.32 g/g), when compared
to the pristine FF-R material (Qm ≈
4.26 g/g). Moreover, the binding affinity (KBET) values for the milled samples exceed those of the pristine
FF-R (cf. Table 3)
that further supports an increase in the textural properties, along
with greater surface accessibility of the functional groups for the
milled samples. It has been shown that modification of biomass by
acetylation reduces the moisture uptake of the modified
materials by up to 65%,29 indicating the
key role of accessible polar active sites for water uptake (Table 3).

isotherms and the uptake parameters for

4 Conclusions
This
contribution reports on a study of the structural and physicochemical
properties of FF-R and modified forms, according to variable levels
of mechanical milling and grinding. The modified FFs were sieved through
various mesh sizes (420, 210, and 125 μm) denoted as FF-420,
FF-210, and FF-125, respectively. The structural features of the FF-R
and mechanically modified forms (FF-420, -210, and -125) reveal differing
surface chemistry and textural properties (SA and pore structure)
according to several complementary techniques: microscopy (SEM), spectroscopy
(FT-IR, XPS, and PXRD), and thermal analyses (DSC and TGA). The adsorption
properties of the materials were assessed using solvent (water) swelling
and adsorption isotherms using nitrogen gas, water vapor, and a hydrophilic
dye probe in aqueous solution. The hydration properties of the FF
biomass are governed by several factors: (1) the textural properties
(SA and pore structure), (2) surface properties (e.g., surface charge),
and (3) the availability of accessible surface sites, as revealed
by the complementary methods reported herein. Gravimetric water swelling,
WRV, and vapor adsorption results provide further support that size
reduction of FFs upon milling is accompanied by changes in physicochemical
properties such as surface charge, crystallinity, thermal stability,
morphology, and accessibility of surface functional groups. Because
natural FFs are composed of various biopolymer components (cellulose,
hemicellulose, pectins, and lignins) with variable composition and
C/OH ratios, changes in the chemical composition are anticipated upon
mechanical grinding of the fibers because of changes in the particle
size and fiber fibrillation effects. Consequently, alteration of the
structure and physicochemical properties of the milled flax samples
results in significant changes to their hydration properties, as evidenced
by the enhanced water affinity for both the liquid and vapor. A key
outcome of this study reveals that mechanical milling of flax biomass
contributes to valorization of fibers to yield biomaterials with tunable
physicochemical properties. In turn, promising applications of agricultural
biomass waste are anticipated in energy, food, biomedicine, and adsorbents
for environmental remediation.51
