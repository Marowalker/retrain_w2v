Glycoderivatives
are an important class of molecules with enormous
relevance in numerous biological phenomena; therefore, they have a
key role in the learning, understanding, and assessment of different
diseases. Nanotechnology, and in particular the design of new nanomaterials,
is one of the areas of greatest interest today. In this case, graphene
nanomaterials represent very interesting platforms for studying glycosystems,
glyconanomaterials that combine the biomolecular recognition and the
characteristics of nanoscale objects in the development of early diagnosis
systems, and efficient specific therapeutic modalities. In this mini-review,
we discuss some results recently described in the literature on the
conjugation of graphene materials and carbohydrates through the selective
interaction of glycoenzymes in graphene to create new materials with
biosensing applications, the development and application of sugar–graphene
composites, and finally biosystems combining the properties of graphene
with metallic nanoparticles and sugars for the creation of excellent
glyconanomaterials as novel systems for the therapy or diagnosis of
important diseases such as cancer or diabetes.

1 Introduction
Saccharides of cell surface
glycoproteins and glycolipids contribute
to many biological phenomena such as adhesion, cancer cell metastasis,
cellular recognition, or infection of pathogens by protein–carbohydrate
interactions.1,2 However, a single interaction
is usually weak, but multivalent ligands can compensate for this deficiency
by binding multiple binding sites to one biological entity simultaneously.

At this point, many different research laboratories have developed
novel strategies for the synthesis of tailor-made glycoderivatives,
such as oligosaccharides, glycopolymers, or glycopeptides, as carbohydrate-based
multivalent ligands for tailored and structurally defined glycan-based
probes for biomedical
applications.1

Nanotechnology, and
in particular nanomedicine, represents one
of the most applied technologies in biomedicine for the prevention
and treatment of diseases. This technology involves the use of nanoscale
materials—such as biocompatible nanoparticles, nanostructures
and nanorobots—for diagnosis, delivery, sensing, or actuation
purposes in a living organism.2

In
this term, graphene—sp2-hybridized carbon
framework of one atom thickness—has emerged as a new alternative
in biomedical applications.3 The two-dimensional
(2D) planar structure of graphene provides a large surface area for
loading drugs/biomolecules and the possibility of conjugating fluorescent
dyes for bioimaging. The high near-infrared absorbance makes graphene
ideal for photothermal therapy. Also, graphene and derivatives (graphene
oxide, GO) showed excellent electrochemical properties better than
other materials for biosensor fabrication. Henceforth, graphene turns
out to be a reliable multifunctional material for use in diagnosis
and treatment. It exhibits antibacterial property by directly interacting
with the cell membrane. Potential application of graphene and derivatives
(graphene oxide) as a scaffold for the attachment and proliferation
of stem cells and neuronal cells is captivating in a tissue regeneration
scenario.

Fabrication of 2D graphene into a 3D structure is
made possible
with the help of 3D printing, a revolutionary technology having promising
applications in tissue and organ engineering. Indeed, graphene materials
conjugated with different molecules such as quantum dots, PEG, biotin,
etc., have been successfully described for biomedical applications.3

However, the efficient, sustainable, and
economical production
of graphene is an important issue for its industrial development.
At this point several strategies have been recently developed using
biomolecules for synthesizing few- or multilayers graphene from graphite.4 In particular, one strategy consists of the use
of enzymes
for selective exfoliation of graphite flakes to graphene, obtaining
a functionalized graphene material at mild conditions in a high amount.4a

Glyconanomaterials have been recently
described by different strategies
involving metals, magnetism, fluorescence or liposome, silica glycomaterials,
polymers, and dendrimers.5 Graphene nanomaterials
represent very interesting platforms to study glycosystems. Glyconanomaterials
which combine the biomolecular recognition and the features of nanoscale
objects, where graphene has important roles in enhancing the relatively
weak affinities of single carbohydrate ligands to the corresponding
receptors, effectively amplifies the carbohydrate-mediated interactions.

Furthermore, the application of metal nanoparticles —particularly
gold, silver or magnetic iron nanoparticles— has demonstrated
to be an advantage
in biomedicine,6 being the combination
of these with glycans and graphene a new technology to create smart
materials in biology.

In this mini-review, we have focused on
the main current results
described in the literature on the development of graphene-based glyconanomaterials
(glycographene) for applications in photochemo and photothermal therapy,
bioimaging and nanobiosensor for different diseases (Figure 1).

(glycographene) technology in biosensor
and therapy applications.

2 Immobilization of Glycoenzymes on Graphene Materials
Graphene is becoming a very attractive material for protein immobilization
to be used as biosensors for detection of carbohydrates.7 The most important
and widely applied are glucose biosensors based on immobilization
of glucose oxidase (GOX), but recently there has been an increase
in interest for the preparation of efficient lactose biosensors, which
is a serious challenge due to the necessity of immobilization of two
enzymes, β-galactosidase and GOX. In a vast majority
of publications, biosensors for sugar determination with immobilized
enzymes are constructed to measure the electrochemical signal, but
there are also important examples of enzyme-containing optical sugar
biosensors. With respect to the biochemical part of the biosensor,
enzyme-based biosensors are still the most frequently used biosensing
platforms surpassing the immunosensors (using antibodies as the recognition
element), the genosensors (using nucleic acids), the aptasensors (using
aptamers), and the cell-based sensors.8

Nanomaterials are becoming increasingly important in this
field
of application because they have properties that can overcome the
drawbacks of conventional biosensors (limited stability, biofouling,
and matrix interferences) and improve the performance factors of electrochemical
biosensors such as sensitivity, response time, and limit of detection
(LOD). The large surface area increases the immobilized biomolecule
loading, but additional requests are ease of preparation, chemical
stability for the use as a suitable matrix in biosensor fabrication,
and fast electron transfer kinetics, which enhance the electroactive
surface area. Among them, electrochemical enzymatic biosensors based
on graphene or graphene oxide have an important role in the pharmaceutical
and biomedical fields due to their sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness,
simplicity, and possibility of miniaturization.

The modification
of the graphene surface with metals has been demonstrated
as an alternative to improve biosensor performance.9−11

In this
way, Park and co-workers have recently developed a nanostructured
metal–enzyme–graphene composite as a glucose biosensor.9

The nanomaterial was created on a gold
chip, generating on it GO
nanofibers by using poly(vinyl
alcohol) (PVA) with GO, and then AuNPs were deposited
on graphene material. The final step was deposition of the glucose
oxidase (GOX)/peroxidase-Cu nanoflower nanohybrid on the AuNP–graphene.
This enzyme–graphene composite was tested as a biosensor, obtaining
highly linear electrochemical response to glucose concentration, with
limit of detection as low as 0.018 μM glucose.9 Moreover, this novel biosensor showed very high selectivity
and stability.9

Another interesting
metal–graphene
system as a glucose biosensor based on a very complex amine-terminated
multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide/gold
nanoparticle modified screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) with
immobilized GOX has been recently developed.10 The NH2-MWCNT/rGO hybrid composite was applied due to
better electrochemical sensing ability, enhanced direct electron transfer,
and more capacitance when compared with simple NH2-MWCNTs
and rGO-modified electrodes. For improvement of electrical conductivity,
polyaniline was included in the composite electrode, without any binder,
in order to shorten the ion diffusion path and reduce interfacial
resistance. Then citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles were incorporated,
and GOX was directly immobilized on the fucntionalized graphene electrode
by adsorption.10 The biosensor was tested
by amperometric analysis in a human blood serum sample with very high
selectivity, stability with a low detection limit of 64 μM,
and good sensitivity (246 μ Acm–2 mM–1).10

Among the most
widely used mediators for the construction of amperometric
biosensors are ferrocene derivatives. The modification of the reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) surface with nanosized ferrocene moieties has
been recently developed as new glucose biosensors.10 Two different ferrocene starting materials were
used, and the graphene oxide doped with carboxylated ferrocene exhibited
the best conductivity. Furthermore, these carboxylic groups were used
for covalent immobilization of GOX on the graphene surface. The biosensor
showed very high selectivity toward glucose with a low detection limit
of 0.01–0.04 μM.11

Another
direction of biosensor dosing is the application of site-specific
interactions between enzymes and nanomaterials by bioaffinity or cofactor–apoenzyme
interaction (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Immobilization of GOX based on the apoenzyme–cofactor interaction.

One example of the latter has been described by
Kalcher and co-workers.12 The idea consisted
of the fabrication of a glucose
biosensor by a site-specific immobilization of GOX by FAD-functionalized
graphene. FAD is a cofactor of the enzymes, and this was used as a
biosensor with desired orientation of enzyme and improved electron
transfer due to the direct electrical communication between the cofactor
and electrode surface (Figure 2). FAD was covalently attached to graphene nanoribbons (previously
adsorbed on a screen-printed carbon electrode), and in the next step
the apoenzyme was added to recombine with the cofactor. Analytical
performance
of the biosensor was analyzed by amperometric measurements. Measured
LOD was 0.1 mM glucose, which has lower sensitivity in comparison
to other nanomaterial-based biosensors, but it has sufficient sensitivity
for glucose determination in human serum.12

In another case, a very interesting example of bioaffinity
immobilization
of GOX was described by Zhou and co-workers.13 The immobilization was based on the
fact that GOX is a glycoprotein with high-mannose-type carbohydrate
content (10–16%, w/w), which can be used as an immobilization
site by using a lectin–sugar interaction. Concanavalin A (ConA),
being the most extensively studied lectin, was used in this immobilization.
Hence, selectively oriented immobilization of GOX on GO was based
on the lectin–sugar biospecific interaction between ConA and
the glycoenzyme, which is important for the final efficiency of the
biosensor.14 First, ConA was covalently
immobilized on preactivated GO through diimide-activated amidation.
Second,
oriented immobilization of GOX was performed based on the strong
biospecific affinity between sugar residues of GOX and ConA.13

Lactose biosensors are more complex because
the transformation
of lactose to an electrochemically detectable compound (hydrogen peroxide)
comprises two consequetive reactions: hydrolysis of lactose to glucose
and galactose catalyzed with β-galactosidase and subsequent
GOX-catalyzed oxidation of glucose
to gluconic acid with production of H2O2. An
interesting example of graphene application for lactose
biosensors has been recently reported by Nguyen et al.15 focused on
enzyme-co-immobilization on the Pt microelectrode
modified with graphene and 1,5-polydiaminonaphthalene
(P(1,5-DAN)) film, where the combination enhanced the sensitivity
of the electrode. Finally, the performance of the obtained electrode
was tested as lactose biosensors and excellent linearity of the relationship
between amperometric output, and lactose concentration was observed
with LOD of 1.3 μg mL–1 and sensitivity of
1.33 μA ml μg–1.15

Although biosensors with immobilized enzymes for
detection of sugars
almost exclusively use electrochemical measurement as output correlated
with sugar concentration, other types of detection methods are emerging.
Recently, Cai and co-workers have developed an optical fiber-based
in situ label-free glucose biosensor (Figure 3).16

Figure 3 (a) Fiber optic
biosensor with covalently immobilized GOX and experimental
setup for an optic glucose sensor. (b) Transmission spectra of an
optimized optic biosensor. Figure was reprinted from ref (16). Copyright © 2020,

The first step in optical biosensor
construction was deposition
of GO film on long-period fiber grating (LPFG), which is particularly
appropriate for detection of biological molecules. Then, immobilization
of GOX on GO was performed by mixing EDC and NHS as two cross-linking
reagents. It must be emphasized that for adequate performance of an
optical biosensor it is necessary to select a suitable sensitive material
for improving grating sensitivity. The LPFG sensor system consists
of a light source, LPFG probe, and an optical spectrum analyzer (Figure 3a). The reaction
catalyzed by GOX creates gluconic acid and H2O2, which lead to an evident shift of the LPFG transmission spectrum
due to the greater change of the surrounding refractive index (Figure 3b). The sensitivity
of glucose measurement was 0.77 nm. Moreover, the selectivity of the
LPFG biosensor was high in the presence of usual interferences in
the determination of blood glucose
concentration (ascorbic acid, Na+, K+, Cl–, ...). Additionally, another advantage of this system
was a very short response time determined (2.16 s).16

3 Conjugation of Carbohydrates to Graphene Materials
Coating and functionalization of graphene derivative materials
(GO and rGO) have been demonstrated to be efficient methods for the
preparation of novel nanomaterials to be employed in cancer treatment,
in particular for drug delivery, photothermal therapy (PTT), and combination
cancer therapy.17−21 The simultaneous reduction and functionalization process of GO derivatives
enables us to prepare and carry out direct surface modification to
fulfill the requirements of combinatorial cancer therapy. In this
sense, polysaccharides, such as hyaluronic acid, chitosan, and fucoidan,
can be promising for functionalization and reduction of GO derivatives
based on their biocompatibility, aqueous solubility, and potential
biologically
active characteristics due to there being plenty of available
functional groups.19

Ligand-modified
polymers, such as mannose-modified cyclodextrin
or lactose-functionalized magnetoliposomes, have been demonstrated
as efficient targets for liver cancer cells.21 In this way, a large amount of materials modified with galactose
(i.e., galactosylated chitosan, galactosylated polyethylene
glycol, galactose-modified polyethylene acetate, and galactose-modified
polycaprolactone) have been used as a drug delivery system for hepatic
carcinoma therapy. Thus, Yu and co-workers21 have developed a novel drug delivery
system consisting of nanoparticles based on galactosylated chitosan/graphene
oxide/doxorubicin (GC–GO–DOX). DOX is a widely used
aromatic drug for cancer treatment. The use
of chitosan (CS) glycopolymer was aimed at not only increasing the
biocompatibility of the drug carrier for sustained and controlled
drug release but also improving the stability of the nanocomposite
in biological media.

On the other hand, since the lack of active
targeting (and subsequently
a poor tumor cell internalization) has limited the therapeutic effect
of GO-based drug delivery systems and paradoxically exacerbated collateral
damage, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been employed in order to investigate
the possibility of active targeting. HA is a well-understood biodegradable
polymer which exhibits low immunogenicity and specific targeting to
receptors such as cluster determinant 44 (CD44) overexpressed in many
malignant tumors. Huo and co-workers18 developed
a redox-sensitive, hyaluronic-acid-decorated
graphene oxide nanosheet (HSG) for tumor cytoplasm-specific rapid
delivery using near-infrared (NIR) irradiation-controlled endo-/lysosome
disruption and redox-triggered cytoplasmic drug release (Figure 4). The prepared system
consisted of GO conjugated via disulfide linkages with a synthesized
thiol-glycopolymer (HA-CYS).

and (B) NIR irradiation-controlled
endo-/lysosomal escape for tumor cytoplasm-selective delivery for
enhanced cancer treatment. Reprinted from ref (18). Copyright ©

After the glycopolymer modification of GO, DOX was added to the
material, taking advantage of the high drug loading capacity of GO
due to its π-conjugated system and large specific area, keeping
on the graphene surface via π–π stacking interaction.

The modified sugar moiety improves the system compared to standard
graphene oxide, including high biological stability, enhanced drug
loading capacity for aromatic molecules, HA receptor mediated active
tumor
targeting, greater NIR absorption and thermal energy translation,
and a sharp redox-dependent response for accelerated cargo release.18

Another recent strategy is based on the
preparation of a new glycographene,
based on the functionalization of reduced graphene oxide with a new
glycopolymer, synthesized by grafting hyaluronic acid onto poly(maleic
anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAO).20

This amphiphilic polymer permits us to obtain a graphene
material
with a hydrophilic surface with sugar molecules to be used in targeted
cancer PTT.

Considering the sustainability and economical point
of view in
the fabrication of nanosystems applied in biomedicine, the use of
a natural source could represent a good alternative. At this point,
Fucoidan (Fu), a fucose-rich sulfated polysaccharide which is extracted
from brown algae and brown seaweed,
has been demonstrated to display advantageous properties such as antiviral,
anticancer, antiproliferative, and anti-inflammatory effects,19 thereby indicating the convenience of its use
for biological applications.

In this regard, Kim and co-workers19 have created a nanoglyco device using a Fu glycopolymer
with a combinatorial
approach for cancer therapy. Fu was previously conjugated on the graphene
oxide by chemical reaction of OH of the sugar with the epoxide group
of the graphene oxide. This enables us to obtain a hydrophilic water-soluble
graphene material.19

After that,
the DOX molecule was conjugated with the polymer on
the graphene surface to obtain the nanoglycomaterial. Then, the photothermal
therapeutic effect and cytotoxicity of Fu-rGO, photothermal intracellular
distribution of DOX-Fu-rGO, and combinatorial therapeutic effect of
DOX-Fu-rGO were studied using human cervical cancer line (HeLa) cells.19

Excellent cellular permeabilization was
observed for the DOX-Fu-rGO
nanomaterial with a sustained release of DOX inside the HeLa cells.
Furthermore, the trimodal treatment of chemo-biothermo (DOX/Fu/PTT)
treated cells showed only
10.99% of cell viability, considering 100% for the untreated HeLa
cells.19 These results attest the efficiency
of this combinatorial treatment.

4 Conjugation
of Carbohydrate and Metal Nanoparticles
to Graphene Materials
Graphene or graphene oxide (GO), as
a two-dimensional carbon (2D)
nanomaterial with unique physicochemical properties, has attracted
much attention in the field of therapy and diagnosis. GO and graphene
have good biocompatibility and near-infrared absorbance (NIR), thus
creating an opportunity to prepare carriers of cancer photochemotherapy
drugs. Recently, a widely prescribed strategy to achieve efficient
external targeting is to integrate GO with metal nanoparticles (Fe,
Au, Cu, etc.) to form a hybrid, which can lead to drug carriers through
an external magnetic field in both separations as in the treatment
of the tumor.22 In addition, if a biomolecule
(DNA, enzyme, glucose, hyaluronic acid, etc.) is added to this hybrid,
it can help to incorporate the medicine and offer greater biocompatibility.23−26

In particular, a simple carbohydrate molecule as glucose was
applied
for the preparation of a glyco-Fe-graphene material.23 This is an interesting and green strategy where Fe2+ can promote oxidation of the glucose in the presence of
oxygen dissolved in the aqueous solution as shown in the following
reaction:  

This caused a chemical
exfoliation of reduced graphene oxide sheets
with suitable water solubility through functionalization of the reduced
sheets by gluconate ions.

Thus, this new glyco-Fe material (GRGO-Fe)
was utilized as a biocompatible
nanomaterial suspension for a highly efficient NIR photothermal therapy
of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro. It was found
that the GRGO-Fe with a concentration of 1 mg mL–1 required only 0.5 min for complete destruction of the cancer cells
under irradiation of an 808 nm laser source with power density of
7.5 W cm–2. These results indicated that the GRGO-Fe
can be one promising biocompatible nanomaterial for photothermal nanotherapy
of cancer cells.

Recently, a novel glycosylated protein-Co nanosheet–graphene
system has been developed as a nitrite electrochemical biosensor.24 A porous Co3O4 hexagonal
nanosheet was conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP),
and then this was immobilized on reduced graphene oxide. Finally,
this nanocomposite was supported on a glassy carbon electrode. Co3O4 nanosheets show excellent biocompatibility providing
a protective microenvironment for HRP to retain its enzymatic stability
and activity. Also, graphene material is an outstanding medium of
efficient electrical communication between the enzyme and the electrode.
For the entrapment of the target substrate on its high surface area,
the resulting substrate gets close to a large quantity of enzymes
immobilized in the porous Co3O4 nanosheets.24 This nanomaterial displays an extremely low
limit of detection (LOD) of nitrite as 0.21 μM.24

Another type of glyconanomaterial has been synthesized
by Shuang
and co-workers22 for chemotherapy (Figure 5) where a new biocompatible
and hydrophilic β-cyclodextrin-hyaluronic acid (CDHA) glycopolymer
was conjugated with GO grafted with Fe3O4 magnetic
nanoparticles (MGO) (Figure 5a). GO nanosheets were synthesized from graphite powder and
then combined with an iron salt to form magnetite nanoparticles on
the graphene surface (Figure 5a).22 On the other hand, the CDHA
polymer was synthesized by means of an amide condensation reaction
between sodium salt mono-6-deoxy-6-ethylenediamino-β-CD and
HA using carbodiimide (EDC)/N-hydroxysuccinimide
(NHS) strategy (Figure 5a). The synthesized CDHA polymers
improved the stability of MGO under physiological conditions for other
sugar molecules which can help the biodistribution in living organisms27 and offered the ability to target cancer cells
with HA receptors. Subsequently, a common anticancer drug, doxorubicin
(DOX), was loaded into the CDHA-MGO by host–host interaction
and hydrophobic interaction. The nanocomposite loaded
with DOX (DOX@CDHA-MGO) exhibited sustainable releases activated by
NIR in the acidic environment of the tumors (Figure 5a). The in vitro DOX@CDHA-MGO
cell absorption experiment showed recognition of active targeting
mediated by the CD44 receptor and chemo–photothermal synergistic
therapy of hepatoma
cells (Figure 5b).
Therefore, this glycoiron nanomaterial possesses an important feature:
(i)
high loading efficiency of antitumor drug for chemotherapy, (ii) high
NIR absorption and efficient heat transformation for photothermal
therapy, (iii) CD44 targeting for accumulation within tumor cells
via HA conjugation,
and (iv) easy separation and magnetic targeting properties with an
external
magnetic field.

In 2019, the measurement of glycated hemoglobin
(known as HbA1c),
the most important glycated protein according to the American Diabetes
Association,28 has been identified as a
standard diagnostic tool for detection, evaluation, and management
of diabetes. This glycosylated variety of hemoglobin is formed in
nature when this protein is exposed to plasma sugars (glucose, galactose,
or fructose), and its N-terminal valine residues
are chemically modified via a nonenzymatic pathway. The formation
of the sugar–Hb linkage indicates
the presence of excessive sugar in the bloodstream, often indicative
of diabetes.29 Thus, Omidinia and co-workers25 have recently developed a disposable
electrochemical nanobiosensor for HbA1c determination in real blood
samples. In this case a gold–graphene nanocomposite was fabricated.
Selective interaction of Au–thiol groups was used as a mechanism
for HbA1c identification in blood samples.

This nanocomposite
showed extraordinary properties to the electrode,
providing a repeatable and reproducible measurement with exceptionally
high sensitivity (269.2 μA cm–2) in comparison
with other biosensors and wide linear range of 1 nM–13.83 μM
with a low detection limit of 1 nM.25

5 Summary and Outlook
In this mini-review, we outlined
a variety of novel nanomaterials
based on the combination of graphene and glycoderivatives, exhibiting
promising properties regarding its application in diagnosis and therapy
of different diseases such as cancer or diabetes. Also, the development
of graphene–glycoenzyme materials as sugar biosensors has been
discussed.

Therefore, future aspects could include the creation
of new systems
of more simple production of functionalized graphene which permits
a selective modification of glycomolecules, glycopeptides, and glycoproteins
for biosensor preparation, where the selectivity of the molecule is
crucial, or novel methods to control the transport and realese of
a target molecule. Also, the combination of glycographene with metal
nanoparticles which improved therapeutic strategies, such as thermotherapy
system, will be crucial. Therefore, the application of a multidisciplinary
collaborative approach will permit successful fabrication of new materials
for future nanomedicine.
