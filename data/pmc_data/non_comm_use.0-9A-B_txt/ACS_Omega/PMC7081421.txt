Transparent
single crystals of two new iodates K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl have been
synthesized hydrothermally. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was used
to determine their crystal structures. Both compounds crystallize
in non-centrosymmetric space groups. The compound K3Sc(IO3)6 crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Fdd2. The crystal structure is made up of [ScO6] octahedra, [IO3] trigonal pyramids, and [KO8] distorted cubes. The compound KSc(IO3)3Cl
crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3. The
building blocks are [ScO6] octahedra, [KO12]
polyhedra, and [IO3] trigonal pyramids. The Cl– ions act as counter ions and reside in tunnels in the crystal structure.
The second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements at room temperature,
using 1064 nm radiation, on polycrystalline samples show that the
SHG intensities of K3Sc(IO3)6 and
KSc(IO3)3Cl are around 2.8 and 2.5 times that
of KH2PO4 (KDP), respectively. In addition,
K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl are phase-matchable at the fundamental wavelength
of 1064 nm. The large anharmonicity in the optical response of both
compounds is further supported by an anomalous temperature dependence
of optical phonon frequencies as well as their enlarged intensities
in Raman scattering. The latter corresponds to a very large electronic
polarizability.

Introduction
New strategies for
designing non-centrosymmetric (NCS) materials
are attracting interest because of their potential technological applications.
Some properties of NCS materials, for example, ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity,
and optical activity like second-harmonic generation (SHG), are often
linked to the manufacturing of data storage devices, sensors, and
laser devices.1−3

A synthetic strategy that has proven successful
to increase the
probability to form NCS compounds is to include acentric building
units in the crystal structure.4−6 Lone electron pair cations of
p-elements such as I5+, Te4+, or Se4+ comprise an active electron pair that occupies space and has a volume
that can be compared with the volume of an O2– anion.
Those cations tend to adopt asymmetric one-sided coordination geometries
such as trigonal pyramidal or see-saw coordination. The heaviest cations
of this kind are Bi3+ and Pb2+, and because
of their stronger attracting nucleus, they are equipped with a less
stereochemically active lone pair occupying a relatively small volume.
These ions often have a high coordination number, and they may form
asymmetric building units such as distorted cubes.7

There are several optically active compounds reported
that comprise
p-element lone-pair cations. One such compound is BiSeO3F, which involves the two lone pair cations Bi3+ and Se4+ and in addition a halide ion as well.8 There are also NCS iodates reported in the literature that
belong to the L–I5+–O system, with L = Bi3+, and show optical activity, e.g. BiO(IO3)9 and Bi2(IO4)(IO3)3.10 Additionally, the system
A–L–I5+–O also exists with relevant
reported compounds belonging to A2BiI5O15, where A = K+ or Rb+ and L = Bi3+.11

Another family of iodates
is A–M–I–O that
combines I5+ with highly coordinated A ions, Na+, K+, Rb+, or Cs+, with a transition
metal that does not give colored compounds, for example, Zn2+, Mn2+, or Mo6+. Examples of reported NCS compounds
belonging to this system are K2Mn(IO3)4(H2O)2 and K2Zn(IO3)4(H2O)2.12

In this study, the K+–Sc3+–I5+–O and K+–Sc3+–I5+–Cl systems are explored, and two new NCS compounds
are reported, K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl. Both are SHG active with intensities that
are approximately 2.8 and 2.5 times that of KDP for K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl, respectively.

Results
and Discussion
Crystal Structure of K3Sc(IO3)6
The new iodate K3Sc(IO3)6 crystallizes in the orthorhombic NCS space group Fdd2 with unit cell parameters a = 39.507(3)
Å, b = 8.2507(6) Å, and c = 11.3283(7)
Å. Crystal structure refinement data are summarized in Table 1. There is one crystallographically
independent Sc3+, two K+, three I5+, and nine O2– ions in the crystal structure. The
oxidation states of the cations are confirmed by bond valence sum
(BVS) calculations using the theoretical bond distance values from
Brown and Altermatt.19 There are three
building units in the crystal structure, [KO8] distorted
cubes, [ScO6] octahedra, and [IO3] trigonal
pyramids. An overview of the structure is shown in Figure 1a.

According to Brown’s operational definition
of bond lengths,
a ligand should contribute with at least 4% to the valence of the
central cation in order to be considered to belong to the primary
coordination sphere; this definition sets the maximum distance for
the K–O bonds to be 3.32 Å.20 There are eight K–O distances that fulfill this condition,
and they are in the range 2.644(13)–3.168(15) Å. The distorted
cubes [K1O8] and [K2O8] are connected to each
other via edge-sharing to form [K3O18] trimers
along [100]; see Figure 1b.

All the three crystallographically independent iodine atoms
have
a trigonal pyramidal [IO3] coordination. The one-sided
coordination is due to the presence of the stereochemically active
lone-pair on I5+. The I–O bond distances are in
the range 1.748(10)–2.100(17) Å that is close to the I–O
bond distance range, 1.77(3)–1.95(3) Å, reported for I2O5.21 The [I1O3] trigonal pyramids are isolated from each other, and are connected
to one [ScO6] octahedron via corner-sharing and to two
[K1O8] distorted cubes via corner- and edge-sharing, respectively.
The [I2O3] and [I3O3] trigonal pyramids alternate
and almost form [I2O6]∞ chains
along [010]. However, the O7 and O8 atoms compete for both I2 and
I3, resulting in that they split into two positions, each with 0.5
probability. In practice, this means that there are no chains, but
rather have alternating [I2O5] groups and [IO3] groups (see Figure 1c).

The [ScO6] octahedra connect to a [IO3] trigonal
pyramid at each corner (two of each of I1, I2, and I3) and two [K2O8] distorted cubes via edge-sharing. The Sc–O bond distances
are in the range 2.035(7)–2.137(14) Å, and are close to
the Sc–O bond distance range 2.08–2.16 Å, as reported
for Sc2O3.22

A family of polar compounds is reported in the literature, A2Pt(IO3)6 (A = H3O, Na, K,
Rb, and Cs). The iodine atoms form [IO3] trigonal pyramids
with I–O bonds from 1.782(9) to 1.905(10) Å. In this group
of compounds, there are highly coordinated A ions, where, for example,
Na is nine coordinated with Na–O distances in the range 2.570(11)–2.997(19)
Å. Finally, the platinum atoms form regular isolated [PtO6] octahedra with Pt–O bond distances between 1.994(8)
and 1.998(6) Å.23 This family has
similar building groups, with bond length values comparable to K3Sc(IO3)6 iodate. An isostructural compound
KH(IO3)2 is previously described that crystallizes
in the same space group Fdd2 having similar unit
cell parameters.24

Crystal Structure of KSc(IO3)3Cl
The new compound KSc(IO3)3Cl crystallizes in
the trigonal space group R3 with unit cell parameters a = 8.0875(3) Å and c = 27.5774(12)
Å. The crystal structure was solved from single-crystal X-ray
data, and the refinement data are presented in Table 1. There are two crystallographically independent
atoms of the ingoing cations K+, I5+, and Sc3+, respectively, and six independent O2– and two Cl– anions. The oxidation state of the
ions was confirmed by BVS calculations.19

An overview of the crystal structure is shown in Figure 2a. The structure
consists of two types of [KO12] distorted polyhedra, [IO3] trigonal pyramids, and [ScO6] octahedra, respectively.
The [KO12] and [ScO6] building blocks form a
framework with tunnels along both [100] and [110], where the Cl– ions reside as counter ions. The Cl1 atom is surrounded
by six iodine atoms, three I1 at a distance ranging from 3.297(2)
to 3.298(2) Å, and three I2 atoms with distances that average
at 3.182(3) Å. The Cl2 atom is also surrounded by three I1 and
three I2 with distances that average at 3.224(2) atoms and 3.265(2)
Å, respectively. Those long distances to the closest cations
make both the Cl– anions under-bonded with calculated
BVS values of 0.57 and 0.58 for Cl1 and Cl2, respectively; see Figure 2b. The long distances
make it likely possible to replace Cl– with e.g.
Br– or I– in the crystal structure.

of KSc(IO3)3Cl with tunnels
along [100] where the Cl atoms reside. (b) Cl1 and Cl2 in the channels
of KSc(IO3)3Cl with surrounding I1 and I2 atoms.

The I5+ ions adopt one-sided coordination
to form [IO3] trigonal pyramids that do not polymerize.
The I–O
bond lengths are in the range 1.730(6)–1.848(6) Å that
is in agreement with the values of I2O5, 1.77(3)–1.95(3)
Å.21 The K–O bond distances
are in the range 2.888(7)–3.315(7) Å in the [KO12] distorted polyhedra. The longest K–O bond length is on the
wedge of the aforementioned acceptable upper limit of 3.32 Å.27 The Sc–O distances are in the range 2.054(6)–2.088(7)
Å, and they are in agreement with the Sc–O bond distance
range 2.08–2.16 Å reported for Sc2O3.22 There are two crystallographically
unique Sc atoms in the structure, Sc1 and Sc2. The [Sc1O6] octahedron connects to one [K1O12] and one [K2O12] polyhedron via edge-sharing as well as to three [I1O3] and three [I2O3] trigonal pyramids via corner-sharing,
see Figure 3a. The
[Sc2O6] octahedra link with three [K1O12] and
three [K2O12] polyhedra. The latter form a ring around
[Sc2O6] of edge-sharing alternating polyhedra. In addition,
three [I1O3] and three [I2O3] trigonal pyramids
connect to [Sc2O6] via corner-sharing; see Figure 3b.

Sc1 and (b) Sc2.

Several iodates that
also contain chlorine are reported previously.
In Pb3[IO3]2Cl4, the I5+ ions form [IO3] groups with I–O bond distances
in the range 1.808–1.812 Å. The Pb atoms are six- and
eight-coordinated, forming [PbO4Cl2] and [PbO4Cl4] groups, respectively, with a Pb–Cl
bond range of 2.868(2)–3.042(2) Å and a Pb–O bond
distance range of 2.506(7)–2.762(7) Å.26 K2Bi(IO3)4Cl contains
[IO3] and [KO7Cl2] groups with an
I–O bond distance from 1.780(5) to 1.865(5) Å and a K–O
bond distance range 2.705(6)–3.339(5) Å. The I–Cl
distances are between 3.088 and 3.219 Å.27 Another example of iodate chloride is Cd(IO3)Cl, which
is a chain compound where the Cl atoms bond to Cd to form [CdO4Cl2] octahedra with a Cd–Cl bond distance
of 2.566(2) Å and Cd–O bond distances that are in the
range of 2.308(3)–2.314(2) Å. The iodine atoms form trigonal
pyramids that connect to the chains with I–O bond lengths of
1.813(2)–1.833(3) Å.28 The
distance values in the aforementioned examples are close to the corresponding
ones in KSc(IO3)3Cl.

SHG Properties of K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl
SHG intensity versus
particle size revealed that K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl have SHG intensities that
are approximately 2.8 and 2.5 times that of KDP, respectively, see Figure 4. The SHG intensities
of both samples are comparable to similar materials.11,12 The measurements also indicate that both K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl are phase-matchable,
and falls in the class A category of SHG materials.29,30

Optical Spectroscopy of K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl
Raman scattering
in the temperature range 4–300 K was carried out to study if
there were signs of phase transitions.

The symmetry analysis
of K3Sc(IO3)6 with Fdd2 (43) leads to 44 A1 + 44 A2 + 46 B1 + 46 B2 modes with a total sum of 180 modes that could
be observable in Raman scattering or IR spectroscopy. To these modes
also, the I02A and I02B iodine split positions contribute with reduced
intensity due to their partial occupation. The experimental Raman
spectra show approximately 50 modes in the frequency range 35–860
cm–1. The difference between the expected and observed
modes can be explained by a smaller intensity or near degeneracy of
some modes.

The experimental spectrum of modes can be divided
into three frequency
ranges with the typical frequency ranges 35–190 and 205–420
cm–1, and the high frequency range 700–860
cm–1; see Figure 5; the latter range is attributed to IO3 modes.

Figure 5 Raman
scattering spectra of K3Sc(IO3)6 at
four different temperatures. The insets show the frequency,
linewidth, and intensity of selected phonons at 47, 260, 720, and
860 cm–1, respectively.

The modes at 740 cm–1 and 780 cm–1 have extremely high scattering intensity. With 200 and 90 ct/s peak
intensities, they are, respectively, factors 20 and 9 more intense
than the optical phonon of Si under similar experimental conditions.
Both modes show a softening of the peak frequency with decreasing
temperatures, different from the anharmonicity of a normal optical
phonon; see the inset of Figure 5.

The symmetry analysis of KSc(IO3)3Cl with R3 (146) leads to 30A + 30 1E + 30 2E modes. This corresponds to a sum of 90
optically active modes.
In the Raman spectra, approximately 23 modes are observed in the frequency
range 0–950 cm–1, see Figure 6.

Figure 6 Raman scattering spectra of KSc(IO3)3Cl at
four temperatures. The insets show the frequency, linewidth, and intensity
of selected phonons at 40, 418, 790, and 780 cm–1, respectively.

The spectrum of KSc(IO3)3Cl can also be divided
into three frequency ranges. However, because of the smaller number
of modes, it is easier to analyze. There exists an equidistant ladder-like
spectrum of modes at 30–160 cm–1 that resembles
rotational excitations of molecules. Furthermore, there exist modes
with different frequency separations in an intermediate frequency
range 190–420 cm–1 and in a high frequency
range 730–920 cm–1.

In the latter range,
the mode at 790 cm–1 has
the highest scattering intensity. With 140 ct/s peak intensity, it
is a factor 14 more intense than the optical phonon of Si.

This
mode also shows an anomalous softening with decreasing temperatures,
while most of the phonons harden with decreasing temperatures, see
insets of Figure 6.
Nevertheless, further phonons with anomalous frequency evolution exist
at 36 and 420 cm–1.

As mentioned above, the
phonon spectra of K3Sc(IO3)6 and
KSc(IO3)3Cl show rather
distinct groups of modes with different intensities and frequency
separations. This grouping is rationalized within the composition
and functional groups of K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl. Regarding their frequency,
K and Sc displacements contribute mainly to lower frequencies. The
iodate group mainly contributes to high-frequency local vibrations.
For the latter, stretching vibrations in the frequency range of 750–800
cm–1 have indeed been reported in the literature.
However, bending modes are also expected in the range 300–450
cm–1.31,32 The rather different
effect of temperature on the modes is due to the different mechanisms
of anharmonicity that collective phonon vibrations and local modes
are experiencing. A collective optical vibration can decay into pairs
of acoustic modes based on the anharmonicity of the lattice potential.
Such a decay process is strongly reduced for a local mode enhancing
their thermal occupation. Therefore, the electronic polarizability
is enhanced leading to a large scattering intensity in Raman scattering
experiments. The observed scattering intensity with a ratio of 1.4
for the largest intensity modes compares well with the ratio of SHG
enhancements of K3Sc(IO3)6 compared
to KSc(IO3)3Cl.

Conclusions
Two
new NCS iodate compounds are synthesized hydrothermally, K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl. The crystal structures are determined from single-crystal
X-ray diffraction data. The compound K3Sc(IO3)6 iodate crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Fdd2 with unit cell parameters a = 39.507(3)
Å, b = 8.2507(6) Å, and c = 11.3283(7) Å, and the compound KSc(IO3)3Cl crystallizes in the trigonal space group R3 with
unit cell parameters a = 8.0875(3) Å and c = 27.5774(12) Å. SHG measurements at 1064 nm indicate
that both K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl are attractive candidates for nonlinear optical
applications. The related large SHG intensities that are around 2.8
and 2.5, respectively, compared to that of KH2PO4 (KDP), are attributable to a very large electronic polarizability
that also shows up in the enhanced Raman scattering intensity of stretching
modes of the iodate groups.

Experimental Section
Transparent
single crystals of plate-like K3Sc(IO3)6 and block-like KSc(IO3)3Cl were synthesized
via hydrothermal synthesis. The compound K3Sc(IO3)6 was prepared from the starting
materials KIO3 (Alfa Aesar, 98%), I2O5 (Sigma, 98%), and Sc2O3 (Koch-Light Laboratories,
99%) mixed in a molar ratio of 3:1.5:0.5. KSc(IO3)3Cl was prepared from KIO3 (Alfa Aesar, 98%), I2O5 (Sigma, 98%), and ScCl3 (Strem. Chemicals,
99%) mixed in a molar ratio of 1:1:1. The starting materials were
each mixed with 3 ml of deionized water in a 23 ml Teflon-lined autoclave.
The reaction conditions were 230 °C, a temperature plateau of
72 h, and a cooling rate of ca 21 °C/h for both compounds. The
product was purified by rinsing in hot water to dissolve the unreacted
starting materials. The compounds were characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM, HITACHI-TM3000), and their composition was analyzed
by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Structural characterization
was done by single-crystal X-ray diffraction data obtained from a
Bruker D8 Venture diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation; λ
= 0.710730 Å. Data integration was done with software SAINT13 and the absorption correction with software
SADABS14 provided by the manufacturer.
The structures were solved by dual space methods using software SHELXT-2014/715 and refined by the full matrix on F2 using the program SHELXL-2014/7.16 All
atomic positions were refined with anisotropic displacement parameters
for both compounds. Structural drawings were made with software DIAMOND.17 Powder X-ray diffraction was employed for the
confirmation of the sample purity using a PANalytical X’Pert
PRO diffractometer and comparing the experimental patterns with the
relevant theoretical patterns. Data collection was done in a scanning
mode between 5° and 60° and with a θ-step of 0.013.

Raman scattering experiments have been performed using a microspectrometer
(Dilor LabRAM), using 532 nm-laser radiation of 32.7 μW, and
a microscope optics with 50×. The spectra were recorded without
a polarization analyzer, as the shape of the single crystals leads
to an internal light polarization scrambling in the transparent sample.
The temperature dependence has been recorded using a microcryostat
in the range 4–300 K. The phonon intensity has been compared
with scattering on the 520 cm–1 phonon of silicon
under similar experimental conditions. Such an intensity is proportional
to the electronic polarizability at the energy of incident laser radiation
with respect to the investigated phonon displacement.

For second-harmonic
generation (SHG) measurements, K3Sc(IO3)6 and KSc(IO3)3Cl polycrystals were ground
and sieved into distinct particle size
ranges (<20, 20–45, 45–63, 63–75, 75–90,
and 90–125 μm). Relevant comparisons with known SHG materials
were made by grinding and sieving crystalline KDP into the same particle
size range. A 1064-nm pulsed Nd:YAG laser (Quantel Laser, Ultra 50)
generated the fundamental light, and the SHG intensity was recorded
at room temperature on an oscilloscope (Tektronix, TDS3032) regarding
different particle size ranges. No index matching fluid was used in
any of the experiments. Please refer to Ok et al. for a detailed description.18
