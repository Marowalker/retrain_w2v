Surface acetylation
of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) imposes an
important effect on CNC-related mechanical enhancement of hydrophobic
polyester-based composites, of which interfacial properties still
need optimization. In the present work, the surface acetylation of
CNCs was adjusted as a gradient of above ca. 10%. Then, we found that
the surface energy of acetylated CNCs (ACNs) decreased and thus their
hydrophobicity increased as the surface acetylation degree increased.
Hence, the ACNs with varied degrees of acetyl substitution (DSsurface-acetyl) values were attempted to reinforce a
kind of hydrophobic polyester, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). The results indicated that a smaller discrepancy
in the surface energy between the CNC surface and the PHB matrix was
obtained, as the surface acetylation degree increased, and then, the
affinity and interaction between the two components increased, which
improved the homogeneous distribution of ACNs in the PHB matrix. Besides,
in comparison to the nanocomposites filled with 15 wt % unmodified
CNCs, the tensile strength of those with ACNs of 62.9% DSsurface-acetyl was 43.3% higher. This study was the first attempt to adjust the
surface substitution degrees with a gradient profile for the surface
modification of CNCs and prove that acetylation gradient control is
an effective and facile strategy to optimize the mechanical properties.

Introduction
Bio-based materials and innovative process
technologies that could
reduce the dependence on fossil fuel and enable development on a sustainable
material basis have aroused growing interest. Among biologically inspired
nanocomposites, cellulose is probably among the most promising sources
for producing nanoparticles. Particularly, because of the rodlike
morphology and impressive mechanical properties, such as high specific
modulus, low density, nontoxicity, biocompatibility, liquid crystalline
order, and high surface area-to-volume ratio,1−3 cellulose nanocrystals
(CNCs) have obtained much attention in many applications,4−8 especially as a novel kind of renewable nanoreinforcer in nanocomposites.
Their mechanical properties could be significantly enhanced by introducing
a relatively low loading level of CNCs.9 Furthermore, the active hydroxyl groups on the surface of CNCs could
contribute as sites forming interactions with the polymer matrix,
like the hydrogen bond between hydroxyl groups of poly(ethylene glycol)
and CNCs.10 Besides, it has been reported
that the tensile strength and modulus of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) increased by 35.5 and 77%, respectively,
with 5 wt % CNCs10 due to the strong interfacial
bonding between the nanoparticles and the polymer. It has also been
reported that due to the increase in crystallinity of the matrix and
the strong filler–filler interactions via hydrogen bonding,
the tensile strength of polyhydroxylbutyrate valerate nanocomposites
increased from 12.7 to 17.1 MPa by loading 10 wt % CNCs.11

However, the abundant hydroxyl groups
(−OH) on the CNC surface
and their high hydrophilic property resulted in poor interfacial compatibility
and weak interaction between the CNCs and the hydrophobic polymer
matrix, leading to a significant deterioration in the mechanical properties
of nanocomposites,12 which greatly restricted
the use of CNCs. Thus, physical and chemical modifications were considered
as ideal approaches for controlling the surface chemical structure
and hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties of CNCs by adjusting the parameters
of functional groups, such as their category and mass percentage.13,14 Moreover, the introduced groups may exhibit similar hydrophobicity
with the polymer matrix and even provide sites to interact with the
polymer matrix. As a result, considerable improvement in miscibility
between the functionalized CNCs and the polymer matrix together with
a better dispersability of nanofillers could be obtained and thus
improved the load transfer at the filler/matrix interface and stress
equilibrium in the whole nanocomposite system, which eventually led
to achieving high mechanical performances.15,16 Thus, over the last decade, many researchers have been focusing
on improving the interfacial compatibility or interaction between
the CNCs and the polymer matrix and achieving the homogeneous dispersion
of CNCs in the hydrophobic polymer matrix through chemical functionalization,11,17−23 and it has been reported that the tensile strength, Young’s
modulus, and elongation at break of the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)-based nanocomposites with 20 wt %
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)-modified
CNCs were 113, 95, and 17% higher than those of the neat one, respectively.19 In those studies, the improvements were mainly
ascribed to the better dispersion of fillers and strong interfacial
adhesion between the fillers and the matrix due to the chain entanglement.11,19

Although it has been confirmed that the surface functionalization
of CNCs enabled to enhance mechanical properties, further optimization
of mechanical properties by adjusting the surface functionalization
degree of CNCs was seldom explored due to the challenge on controlling
the degree of substitution or grafting of the micromolecules, which
limited further studies on the effect of CNC surface modification
on the relationship between the structure and properties of composites
together with the interface interaction between the CNCs and the polymer
matrix. In this work, to control the surface substitution of CNCs,
we optimized the modifying method of CNCs and investigated the effect
of preparing parameters on the surface acetylation degree of CNCs.
Besides, the effect of CNC surface functionalization on mechanical
reinforcement was investigated by using poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB), a typical hydrophobic polymer,
as the matrix. First, the gradient degrees of CNC surface acetylation
were measured by adjusting the molar ratio of −OH on the CNC
surface and acetic anhydride (AA) through the esterification reaction
between −OH and AA. Then, the dependence of mechanical properties
of nanocomposites upon the surface acetylation gradient of CNCs was
discussed by studying the interfacial compatibility and interaction
between the acetylated CNC (ACN) fillers and the PHB matrix. Moreover,
laser micro-Raman spectroscopy was introduced as a direct method to
measure the miscibility between the CNCs and the PHB matrix. These
results were meaningful to the study on CNC-filled polymers, especially
on hydrophobic polymers, and the composites have a high environmental
value because of the renewability of CNCs.

Results and Discussion
Surface
Acetylation Control of CNCs
First, the introduction
of the acetyl group to CNCs was identified by the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of unmodified and ACNs in Figure 1. We found that after reaction
with AA, the peaks located at 1745 and 1242 cm–1 (the stretching vibrations of −C=O stretching and
C–O–C in the acetyl groups introduced on the CNC surface)
of CNCs emerged. Moreover, the C–O stretching vibration located
at ca. 1060 cm–1, which was assigned to the glucopyranose
ring of cellulose,31,32 was selected as a comparison
for normalizing the variation of the intensity of the peak located
at 1745 cm–1. In this case, the peak heights located
at 1745 and 1060 cm–1, that is, I1745 and I1060, were determined
from the spectra of all ACNs using the baseline constructed by extrapolating
two lines between the valleys at 1790 and 1700 cm–1 and between the valleys at 1500 and 860 cm–133,34 and hence were used to calculate the I1745/I1060 values as the normalized peak
intensity of −C=O stretching vibration. As depicted
in Table 1, it was
worthy to note that the variation of the I1745/I1060 values was positive to the increase
in the feeding molar ratios of AA versus hydroxyl groups on the CNC
surface (OHCNC-surface) and reached a constant plateau
until the feeding molar ratio of AA versus OHCNC-surface was higher than 40:1. These results indicated that changing the
feeding molar ratio between the paired reactive groups might become
a facile approach to control the surface acetylation degree of CNCs
and the limit of efficient regulation was 40:1 of AA versus OHCNC-surface in moles.

Because
the FTIR results showed that the acetylation of AA toward
the CNC surface could be controlled by adjusting the molar ratio of
the paired reactive groups, the accurate values of surface acetyl
substitution might be further confirmed by tests of element analysis.
On the basis of the change in weight fraction of the C element by
the acetylation for CNCs, the degree of acetyl substitution on the
ACN surface (DSsurface-acetyl) was calculated by eq 1. Table 1 summarizes the weight fractions of C, H,
and S (obtained from the acid hydrolysis with sulfuric acid) elements
in the ACNs as well as the calculated DSsurface-acetyl values of the ACNs. With an increase from 5:1 to 40:1 in the molar
ratios of AA versus OHCNC-suface, the DSsurface-acetyl values increased from 11.1 to 62.9%. Especially, for the as-prepared
ACNs in this work, the DSsurface-acetyl values showed
a discrepancy of at least ca. 10%. In addition, when the molar ratios
of AA versus OHCNC-surface increased from 40:1 to
80:1, the DSsurface-acetyl value varied a little.
It was well consistent with the dependence of the I1745/I1060 values upon the
molar ratios of AA versus OHCNC-surface from the
FTIR test and suggested that the highest critical point of the molar
ratio of AA versus OHCNC-surface for adjusting the
surface acetylation of AA toward CNCs should be 40:1.

Morphological
and Crystalline Characters of ACNs
As
well known, the high aspect ratio and crystalline rigidity of CNCs
contribute to a percolation approach and high stress endurance, respectively,
and thus are essential to mechanical reinforcement for polymeric materials.11 As a result, surface chemical modification needs
to maintain the rodlike morphology and crystalline structure of CNCs
as far as possible. Fortunately, as shown in the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) images of Figure 2, all ACNs inherited the rodlike morphology of the
pristine CNCs. Meanwhile, Table 2 also depicts that the statistics such as mean length
and diameter almost remained unchanged with a slight decrease (AA
initiated a slight acid hydrolysis of CNCs) after surface acetylation
and gave the aspect ratios of ACNs equivalent to that of pristine
CNCs. It demonstrated that the surface acetylation of AA toward CNCs
was moderate enough to avoid obviously dismantling the original morphologic
structure of CNCs.

a Percolation threshold was calculated
with the following equation:6 νRc = 0.7/(L/D).

Moreover, the preservation of a
rigid crystalline structure in
ACNs after surface acetylation was expected and the XRD patterns of
both ACNs and CNCs are shown in Figure 3. The predominant diffraction peaks at 2θ values
of 14.7, 16.4, 22.7, and 34.5° were attributed to the diffraction
planes 101, 101̅, 002, and 040 in the crystal type of cellulose
I, respectively.24 In comparison with pristine
CNCs, all of the crystalline characteristic peaks were clearly presented
in the ACN samples. It suggested that the ACNs preserved the initial
crystal form of cellulose in CNCs (although the crystalline index
decreased slightly due to the low crystallinity of acetylated celluloses,
whose repeating units in polymer chains and thus lattice parameters
in crystals are different from those of CNCs). Subsequently, a profound
research on the changes of the crystalline extent and crystal dimensions
was carried out. Table 2 summarizes the values of the crystallinity index (Ic) calculated by eq 2 as well as the dimensions of crystal planes (B002, B101, and B101̅) calculated by eq 3. Obviously, the well-consistent crystalline dimensions
of CNCs and ACNs further strongly supported the fact that no transformation
of the crystal structure of cellulose occurred in the process of surface
acetylation. At the same time, the crystalline index only showed a
slight decrease, suggesting that moderate surface acetylation of AA
retained the initial crystallinity of CNCs to the maximum extent.

molar ratio of AA vs OHCNC-surface.

Effects of Surface Acetylation Degree on
the Hydrophobicity
of CNCs
Because the surface acetylation could increase the
hydrophobicity of CNCs,26 the equilibrium
contact angles of CNCs, ACNs, and hydrophobic PHB toward water and
ethylene glycol as well as the corresponding γsd, γsp, and total γs values were measured (as shown in Table 3). The result showed that the increase of
the acetylation degree exercised a positive influence on hydrophobicity
and resulted in a gradual approach to the equilibrium contact angle
and surface energy (including γsd, γsp, and γs) values of neat PHB.
Such exciting results indicated that higher DSsurface-acetyl of ACNs might exhibit stronger compatibilization with PHB in the
subsequent preparation for nanocomposites. Especially, when the feeding
molar ratio of AA versus OHCNC-surface was higher
than 40:1, the γsd, γsp, and γs values of ACNs tended to be
at a constant level of 18.8, 23.9, and 42.7 mJ/m2, respectively,
which were very close to those of PHB at 15.6 (γsd), 21.1 (γsp), and 36.7 (γs) mJ/m2.

Effects of
Surface Acetylation of Cellulose Nanoparticles on
Dispersity with the PHB matrix
In view of the fact that the
increase of DSsurface-acetyl resulted in the approach
of surface energy to the PHB matrix for the ACNs, the enhanced miscibility
between the ACN surface and the PHB matrix was expected and could
be confirmed if the dispersity of ACNs increased in the PHB-based
nanocomposite films. Thus, Raman mapping spectra of the cellulose
component in PHB were used to characterize the distribution of unmodified
and ACNs in the PHB matrix. As shown in Figure 4, the black portions were assigned to cellulose
component-dominant regions from CNCs or ACNs, whereas the red portions
represented the PHB-dominant regions. Meanwhile, the other visible
colors, such as yellow, green, and blue, might represent the regions
of the mixtures, which consisted of varied compositions of the cellulose
component versus PHB. When the loading level of CNCs or ACNs was 6
wt %, the morphologies of nanocomposites in Figure 4A,D,G depicts the fact that the black isolated
“islands” of cellulose component-dominant regions dispersed
into the red continuous “ocean” of the PHB-dominant
matrix. Obviously, in comparison to the unmodified CNC-filled nanocomposites
in Figure 4A, the ACN-filled
nanocomposites in Figure 4D,G shows smaller size of black cellulose component-dominant
regions, suggesting that the surface acetylation improved the uniformity
of distribution for CNCs in the PHB matrix. With an increase in the
loading level of CNCs from 6 to 30 wt %, Figure 4B,C depicts that the black CNC-dominant region
gradually expanded as a relatively isolated broad phase, whereas the
whole nanocomposite system showed a heterogeneous morphology on the
scale of the laser sampling volume. Correspondingly, the size of the
ACN-dominant region almost did not increase with an increase in the
loading level of ACNs, which was replaced with more mixed regions
marked by yellow, green, and blue colors. These results indicated
that the surface acetylation toward CNCs improved the interpenetrability
between ACNs and PHB and hence gave a relatively homogenous morphology
for the ACN-filled nanocomposites, as shown in Figure 4E,F,H,I. On the other hand, the increase
in the DSsurface-acetyl of ACNs also facilitated
the uniformity in compositions of nanocomposites. Especially, as shown
in Figure 4E,H for
the ACN-filled nanocomposites containing a moderate loading level
of 15 wt %, the distribution of ACNs first displayed as a small island
similar to the morphologies of nanocomposites with low CNC and ACN
loading level and then presented an increasing homogeneity, with a
continuous increase in the DSsurface-acetyl of ACN.
The analogous effect of ACN DSsurface-acetyl on
the dispersity of fillers in the matrix could be observed in Figure 4F,I, when the nanocomposites
contained 30 wt % of ACNs. However, the excess loading level inhibited
the uniformity of the nanocomposite morphologies. These results demonstrated
that the interfacial miscibility between ACN and PHB significantly
increased as the DSsurface-acetyl increased and
the compatibility between ACN and PHB could be improved via surface
acetylation. As a result, the maximum tensile strength should be obtained
in a higher CNC loading level when the DSsurface-acetyl is higher, which was consistent with the experimental results.

G, 6 wt % ACN(IV); H, 15 wt % ACN(IV); I, 30 wt % ACN(IV)). The black
portion represents cellulose component-dominant regions and the red
one represents PHB-dominant regions.

Effects of Surface Acetylation Degree of the CNC on the Fracture
Morphologies of PHB-Based Nanocomposites
As depicted in the
laser micro-Raman mapping images of the nanocomposites filled with
CNCs and ACNs, adjusting the loading level and DSsurface-acetyl of nanofillers in the matrix resulted in phase transformation of
the CNC/PHB composites. Thus, to further study the phase interfaces
between CNCs and PHB, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed.
As shown in Figure 5, when the loading level of nanoparticles was 6 wt %, there were
no obvious interfaces among the fracture morphologies of nanocomposites
(Figure 5A,D,G), which
suggested that the size of the particles and their aggregates of CNCs
or ACNs were still on nanoscale at this loading level. When the addition
of the nanoparticle content was higher, e.g., 15 wt % (Figure 5B,E,H) and 30 wt % (Figure 5C,F,I), the smoothness
of the fracture morphology of PHB-based nanocomposites increased with
DSsurface-acetyl, suggesting that the interface
compatibility between ACN and the PHB matrix increased with the DSsurface-acetyl. The microstructure observation of SEM
images for the nanocomposites further demonstrated that the ACN with
higher DSsurface-acetyl could be
dispersed in the PHB matrix more uniformly, which was consistent with
the analysis and results, as mentioned above. Moreover, the fracture
morphology of the nanocomposites with 15 wt % cellulose nanoparticles
was further investigated by field emission-SEM (FE-SEM), as shown
in Figure 6. Many white
dots on the fractured surface and coarse film surface were found in
PHB/CNC-15 nanocomposites (Figure 6A), indicating their high heterogeneity. For PHB/ACN(II)-15
nanocomposites (Figure 6B), the fractured surface was smoother and rod-shaped nanoparticles
were observed in the nanocomposites, which referred to slight aggregates
of ACN(II). It was worth noting that smooth fractured surfaces were
observed for PHB/ACN(IV)-15 nanocomposites and few rodlike ACNs(IV)
were found in the nanocomposite, which indicated that ACN(IV) nanoparticles
were well embedded into the PHB matrix, suggesting a uniform dispersion
of ACN(IV) within the PHB matrix and strong interfacial interaction
between the two components.19

Optimizing Mechanical Reinforcement via Regulating
Surface Acetylation
Degree of CNCs
Besides improving compatibility of CNCs and
PHB, the aim of surface acetylation toward CNCs was to achieve high
mechanical performances via the strategy of improving the miscibility
between CNC and the PHB matrix as well. Figure 7 depicts the dependence of tensile strength
(σb), Young’s modulus (E),
and elongation at break (εb) of PHB-based nanocomposites
upon the loading level of CNCs and ACNs as well as the surface acetylation
degree of ACNs. Obviously, the incorporation of both unmodified and
ACNs resulted in mechanical reinforcement, namely, the enhancement
of Young’s modulus and tensile strength, with an increase in
the loading level of CNCs and ACNs. Meanwhile, the increase in the
surface acetylation degree of CNCs resulted in higher Young’s
modulus and tensile strength and less expense of elongation at break.
Furthermore, especially for tensile strength, the increase in the
DSsurface-acetyl of ACNs might offset the negative
effect of the high loading level of ACNs. The nanocomposites containing
the ACNs with high DSsurface-acetyl as 62.9% showed
the highest tensile strength (43.6% higher than that of PHB/CNC-15
nanocomposite), and their elongation at break was 12.6% and higher
than that of the PHB filled with 15 wt % unmodified CNCs.

Figure 7 Tensile strength
(A), Young’s modulus (B), and elongation
at break (C) of the PHB-based nanocomposites, as a function of the
loading level of CNCs or ACNs in PHB.

To reveal the mechanism of variation on mechanical properties
of
PHB-based nanocomposites, the mechanical properties of PHB-based nanocomposites
reinforced with either CNCs or ACNs were further investigated by dynamic
mechanical analysis (DMA). Figure 8 shows the trends of the storage modulus (E′) and the loss tangent (tan δ) as a function
of the temperature for neat PHB and PHB-based nanocomposites, respectively.
The obtained data for glass transition temperature (Tg) extracted from the tan δ peak are summarized
in Table 4. By loading
unmodified CNCs with low content (6 wt %), the storage modulus E′ of the PHB-based nanocomposite increased, which
could be ascribed to the reinforcing effect of the CNC, but when the
content increased, E′ decreased, which probably
resulted from the poor dispersability of the highly hydrophilic CNCs
within the hydrophobic matrix, and led to the aggregation of CNCs,
but when the surface of CNC was acetylated, the modulus of the composites
was found to continuously increase upon filler addition (Figure 8A–C). In addition,
a higher maximum reinforcement could be obtained as the DSsurface-acetyl increased. This result could be ascribed to the stronger adhesion
between the PHB matrix and ACNs with higher DSsurface-acetyl, which led to a more efficient stress transfer at the interface.

polyester and wf is the weight fraction
of polyester in the blends. ΔHm* of PHB is 139.3 J/g.35

b Tg is
extracted from the tan δ peak.

In the glass transition, the drop in the storage modulus
and the
decrease in the damping intensity (tan δ) were gradually
reduced as loading levels of the filler increased, regardless of the
type of cellulose nanoparticles. This suggested that the presence
of the cellulose nanoparticles promoted the segmental restrictions
of PHB chains.14 In addition, the reinforced
nanocomposites exhibited higher Tg than
that of the neat PHB (Table 4) due to the strong interaction between the filler and the
matrix in reinforced nanocomposites. It was noteworthy that higher Tg could be obtained as the DSsurface-acetyl of ACNs increased, which could be attributed to the improved interaction
between the PHB matrix and ACNs. These results suggested that the
matrix–filler interaction and compatibility could be improved
by controlling the acetylation degree of CNCs and the filler content.

On the other hand, the DSC curves of neat PHB and nanocomposites
are shown in Figure 9 and the data of melting ranges are shown in Table 4, which were assigned to the PHB component
in the nanocomposite films. The results indicate that the loading
level and DSsurface-acetyl of CNCs and ACNs had
almost no influence on the onset and end temperature of melting transition
as well as the crystallinity degree (χc,PHB) for
the PHB matrix. So, the crystalline structure and degree of the PHB
matrix were not the dominant mechanical reinforcing factors of the
nanocomposites. Thus, the further mechanically reinforcing effects
via surface acetylation of CNCs would be concluded as follows: (i)
the hydrophobicity of the surface on CNCs was adjusted to be close
to that of PHB via gradient acetylation control, which increased the
dispersity, compatibility, and interaction between CNCs and PHB; (ii)
as confirmed above, the surface acetylation toward CNCs did not impair
the rigid crystalline structure and rodlike morphology (i.e., high
aspect ratio) of CNCs, which played a key role in reinforcing fillers.

CNC, (B) ACN(II), and (C) ACN (IV).

Effects of Surface Acetylation Degree on the Rheological Properties
of CNC/PHB Composites
In view of the fact that surface groups
on the CNCs should have significant influence on the rheological behavior
of the nanocomposites, a melt rheological analysis was performed to
study the effect of surface acetylation on the rheological properties
of the samples. Figure 10 shows the viscosity (η*), storage modulus (G≠), and loss modulus (G≡)
of the PHB-based nanocomposites filled with varied loading levels
of CNCs and ACNs. We found that the G≠, G≡, and η* of PHB-based nanocomposites were
slightly higher than those of neat PHB at 6 wt % loading of the rigid
CNC. Besides, as the DSsurface-acetyl of CNCs increased,
the disperisity of cellulose nanoparticles in PHB increased and then
the size of rigid cellulose nanoparticles and their aggregation in
the melt PHB matrix decreased, which resulted in the G≠, G≡, and η* of the PHB-based
nanocomposites to decrease with the increase of the DSsurface-acetyl of CNCs at the loading level of 6 wt %. However, when the loading
level reached 15 wt %, the G≠, G≡, and η* of the PHB-based nanocomposites were much
higher than those of the neat PHB. Meanwhile, the neat CNC would heavily
aggregate in the PHB matrix at this loading level due to their low
compatibility, leading to the G≠, G≡ and η* of PHB/CNC-15 being much higher than
those of PHB/ACN(II)-15 and PHB/ACN(IV)-15. Interestingly, although
the dispersity of ACN(IV) was higher than that of ACN(II), the G≠, G≡, and η* of the
PHB/ACN(IV)-15 were slightly higher than those of PHB/ACN(II)-15.
This result indicated that besides rigid reinforcers, the ACN(II)s
and ACN(IV)s could also act as physical cross-link points in the PHB
matrix due to the improved interaction between ACN(II) (or ACN(IV))
and PHB and the density of cross-linking of ACN(IV) was higher than
that of ACN(II) when the loading level exceeded the νRc of these CNCs (as shown in Table 2) because of the higher disperity of ACN(IV), leading
to the PHB chains moving harder in the ACN(IV) cross-linked network.
Then, when the loading level was much higher than the νRc and increased to 30 wt %, the density of cross-linking of
ACN(IV) or ACN(II) in the PHB matrix increased significantly, leading
to G≠, G≡, and η* of the PHB/ACN(II) and PHB/ACN(IV) increasing and
approaching those of PHB/CNC-30 (as shown in Figure 10C–C″). These results indicated
that the rheological properties of CNC/PHB composites could also be
adjusted by controlling the DSsurface-acetyl of
ACNs, which was meaningful to the processing of CNC/PHB composites.

Conclusions
In
the present work, the surface acetylation degree of CNCs via
reaction with AA could be effectively adjusted as a gradient of above
ca. 10% by adjusting the feeding molar ratio of CNC surface hydroxyl
versus AA, as demonstrated by FTIR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
To improve the compatibility between CNCs and PHB, the surface properties
of CNCs were adjusted to a similar value as those of PHB via surface
acetylation and characterized by contact angle measurement. As a result,
the dispersity of CNCs in the PHB matrix increased substantially with
increase in DSsurface-acetyl of ACNs, which was
confirmed by Raman mapping spectra. Meanwhile, mechanical properties
of PHB-based composites significantly increased via surface acetylation.
Specifically, the tensile strength and elongation at break increased
by 43.3 and 12.6% when DSsurface-acetyl increased
from 0 to 62.9%. To reveal the reinforcing mechanism of surface acetylation,
the crystallinity, interfacial properties, and microstructure of PHB/CNC
and PHB/ACNs nanocomposites were characterized by XRD, DMA, and SEM,
respectively, and we found that the rodlike morphology and crystallinity
of CNCs varied little when the hydroxyl groups (−OHs) on the
surface of CNCs were substituted by acetyl groups, but the interfacial
interaction between PHB and CNCs significantly increased as DSsurface-acetyl increased. Considering the fact that
the dispersity of CNCs in PHB also increased with the DSsurface-acetyl, it can be concluded that the adjustment of the surface properties
of CNCs and improvement of the compatibility between PHB and CNCs
from the modification were the dominant factors of the reinforcing
effect on the surface acetylation.

Materials and Methods
Materials
PHB was purchased from Tianjin Green Bio-science
Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China), with a melt flow index of 3.6 g/10 min
(170 °C, 2.16 kg) and a relative density of 1.2 g/cm3. Cotton linter was supplied by Hubei Chemical Fiber Group Co., Ltd.
(Xiangyang, China). AA, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), acetone, chloroform (CHCl3), pyridine, sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), and other analytical-grade reagents were purchased from Shanghai
Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pyridine was
dried and purified according to standard procedures before use, and
the other reagents were used as received.

Extraction of CNCs
CNCs were prepared by acid hydrolysis
of native cotton linter according to the previous work with a minor
modification.24 The cotton linter was first
treated by 2 wt % aqueous NaOH and then stirred constantly for 12
h at ambient temperature to remove lignin and hemicellulose. The purified
cotton linter was first washed with distilled water followed by filtration
and evaporation and then was dispersed in 65 wt % aqueous H2SO4. Thereafter, it was mechanically stirred for 50 min at 45 °C
to hydrolyze the amorphous or paracrystalline parts of cellulose.
Subsequently, the resultant suspension was diluted with iced water
and centrifuged with distilled water five times. Finally, the treated
suspension was dialyzed with distilled water for 5 days and then freeze-dried
to produce the CNCs in a powder form. The contents of C, H, and S
elements in the as-prepared CNCs were determined as 42.55, 6.52, and
0.27%, respectively, by elemental analysis tests. According to our
previous work,25 the total content of hydroxyl
groups on the surface of CNCs (nsurface-OH) was estimated as 1.20 mmol/g.

Surface Acetylation of
CNCs
Surface acetylation of
CNCs was carried out with a constant stir under nitrogen atmosphere
in a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser.26 First, the CNC powder was dispersed in anhydrous
pyridine via ultrasonication for 15 min to obtain a homogeneous suspension.
Then, a solution of AA in anhydrous pyridine was added dropwise into
the CNC suspension. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was kept at
80 °C with constant stirring under nitrogen atmosphere. After
5 h, the product was isolated by precipitation with 1.0 L distilled
water and purified by washing with distilled water three times and
subsequently with acetone/water solution to eliminate the unreacted
chemicals. Finally, ACN powders were obtained by freeze-drying. In
this case, the feeding molar ratios between AA and hydroxyl groups
on the CNC surface (OHCNC-surface) were set as 5:1,
10:1, 20:1, 40:1, and 80:1 to obtain the corresponding samples coded
as ACN(I), ACN(II), ACN(III), ACN(IV), and ACN(V), respectively.

Preparation of Hydrophobic Polyester-Based Nanocomposites
A kind of hydrophobic polyester, PHB, was reinforced with unmodified
and ACNs by the process of solution blending and subsequent casting
molding. First, a desired amount of CNCs (or ACNs) was dispersed into
chloroform under a sonication treatment for 5 min and then mixed with
PHB. Subsequently, the mixture was mechanically stirred until the
PHB was completely dissolved. Finally, the homogeneous suspension
containing PHB together with CNCs (or ACNs) was casted into a Teflon
mold and evaporated overnight at ambient temperature to produce the
nanocomposite films with a thickness of about 0.2 mm. According to
the loading level of CNCs or ACNs, the resultant nanocomposite films
were coded as PHB/CNC-x or PHB/ACN-x, respectively. According to the contents of CNCs or ACNs in the
nanocomposites as 0, 3, 6, 9, 15, 20, 25, and 30 wt %, the symbol
of “x” in the sample codes might be
replaced by the corresponding numbers. Meanwhile, the “ACN”
in the sample codes might be replaced by ACN(I), ACN(II), ACN(III),
and ACN(IV), respectively, according to the used ACN sources with
varied surface acetylation degrees.

Characterization by FTIR
Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra
of CNCs and all ACNs were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FTIR spectrometer
(Nicolet Instruments) in the range of 4000–400 cm–1 using the method of KBr platelet.

Elemental Analysis
The contents (%) of carbon (C),
hydrogen (H), and sulfur (S) were measured from elemental analysis
(Elemental Vario EL Cube, Germany). Moreover, the degree of acetyl
substitution (DSsurface-acetyl) for ACNs was calculated
according to the following equation 1  where nsurface-acetyl is the amount of surface
acetyl groups on ACN, nsurface-OH is the amount of surface hydroxyl groups
on CNCs, and ΔC is the increment of carbon
content after surface acetylation (ΔC = CACN – CCNC).

TEM
The TEM observations were carried out on an H-7000FA
transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), with an
acceleration voltage of 75 kV. A small amount of CNC and ACN powders
were dispersed in distilled water to give a suspension with a concentration
of 0.1 wt %, respectively, and then negatively stained with a 2% (w/v)
ethanol solution of uranyl acetate.

XRD Measurement
The XRD patterns of dry CNC and ACN
powders were recorded on a D/Max-IIIA X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku
Denki Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα1 radiation
(λ = 0.154 nm) at 40 kV and 60 mA in a 2θ range of 5–70°.
Moreover, the crystallinity indices (Ic) of CNCs and ACNs were calculated according to the Segal equation27 as follows 2  where I002 is
the intensity of the peak located at 22.7° of 2θ that is
associated with the (002) diffraction plane of cellulose crystal and Iam represents the intensity of the baseline
at 18.0° of 2θ.

Additionally, the crystalline dimensions
associated with every diffraction plane in the CNCs and ACNs were
calculated by the Scherrer equation19,28 as follows 3  where Bhkl is the average crystalline width of a specific plane, λ
represents the wavelength of incident X-rays and is equal to 0.154
nm in this study, θ is the diffraction angle located at the
center of the peak, and β1/2 (in radius) represents
the full width at half-maximum of the reflection peak.

Contact Angle
Measurement
The contact angle measurements
of the CNCs and ACNs were performed at ambient temperature using a
dynamic drop tensiometer (DSA10; KRÜSS GmbH, Germany). The
powdered CNCs and ACNs were compacted under a pressure of 20 MPa to
obtain the tested plate with smooth surfaces. The Owens–Wendt
approach29 was used to relate the dispersive
and polar contributions of the surface energy of the tested specimens
to the contributions of the surface tension of liquids, which were
calculated according to the following equation 4  where the variables γ, γd, and γp represent the total, dispersive, and polar
surface energies, respectively; the subscripts of “L”
and “S” refer to the liquid drop and the solid surface,
respectively; and θ denotes the contact angle between the solid
substrate and the liquid drop. The liquids with varied dispersive
and polar surface tensions, such as water and ethylene glycol in this
case, were used to determine the surface energy of CNCs and ACNs,
and the γL, γLd, γLp values of water26 and ethylene glycol30 are 72.8, 21.8,
and 51.0 mJ/m2, and 48.0, 29.0, and 19.0 mJ/m2, respectively.

Laser Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman
images for PHB nanocomposites
were taken on an inVia Laser Micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw, Britain).
The excitation wavelength of the laser source was 785 nm, which was
powered at 50 mW.

Rheological Measurement
The rheological
behaviors of
PHB-based nanocomposites were investigated by a discovery hybrid rotational
rheometer (TA Instruments) with two parallel plates (ϕ = 25
mm). Considering the susceptibility of thermal degradation of cellulose
nanoparticles and the melting temperature of PHB, the testing temperature
was set at 160 °C. The sample was loaded onto the bottom plate
to be premelted for 3 min at 160 °C. The dynamic frequency sweep
test was performed to determine the dynamic properties of the nanocomposite
systems, and the strain and frequency ranges used during testing were
1% and 0.1–500 rad/s, respectively.

Tensile Test
The
tensile strength (σb), elongation at break (εb), and Young’s
modulus (E) of the nanocomposite films filled with
CNCs or ACNs were measured on a CMT6503 universal testing machine
(SANS, Shenzhen, China), with a crosshead rate of 5 mm/min. The σb, εb, and E recorded in
this article were the average of five tests.

SEM
The SEM observation
was carried out on an X-650
scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) to observe the
fractured surface of the nanocomposite sheets. In addition, a FE-SEM
observation was carried out on a Zeiss Ultra Plus scanning electron
microscope (Zeiss, Germany). All samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen
and then immediately snapped. And the fractured surfaces were gold-plated
and then observed and photographed.

DMA
DMA experiments
of PHB nanocomposites were carried
out on a Universal v4.5A TA Instrument (DE) in a temperature range
of −60 to 100 °C at a 3 °C/min heating rate and 3
Hz constant frequency in the tensile configuration.

DSC
The nonisothermal crystallization and melting behavior
were observed by using a NETZSCH DSC 214 instrument (NETZSCH Co.,
Germany) under a nitrogen atmosphere in the range of −70 to
200 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min after pretreatment
for eliminating thermal history (specifically, heating from room temperature
to 110 °C and then cooling to −70 °C).
