One-compartment H2O2-photofuel cells using
monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 film deposited on fluorine-doped
tin oxide (ms-BiVO4/FTO) as the photoanode, Prussian blue
film-coated FTO cathode, and deaerated aqueous electrolyte solution
of 0.1 M NaClO4 and 0.1 M H2O2 were
constructed. Mesoporous TiO2 photoanode cells with the
same cathode and electrolyte solution were also prepared for comparison.
The ms-BiVO4/FTO photoanode was prepared by a two-step
route consisting of spin coating of a precursor solution on FTO and
subsequent heating at 500 °C in the air. The thickness of the
ms-BiVO4 film was controlled in the range from 50 to 500
nm by the number of the spin-coating times. There is an optimum thickness
of the ms-BiVO4 film in the cell performances under illumination
of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2, 1 sun).
Under the optimum conditions, the ms-BiVO4/FTO photoanode
cell provides a short-circuit current (Jsc) = 0.81 mA cm–2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) = 0.61 V, far surpassing the values of Jsc = 0.01 mA cm–2 and Voc = 0.31 V for the conventional mesoporous
TiO2 photoanode cell. The striking cell performance is
ascribable to the high visible-light activity of ms-BiVO4 for H2O2 oxidation and its low thermocatalytic
activity for the decomposition.

Introduction
A sustainable “solar
oxygen cycle” can be completed
by combining the technology for synthesizing H2O2 from H2O and/or O2 and H2O2-fuel cell (FC) (Scheme 1).1 At present, most H2O2 is industrially produced by the anthraquinone
method with the consumption of a large amount of energy.2 As an alternative method, photocatalytic synthesis
of H2O2 via O2 reduction3−7 and H2O oxidation8 are currently
in rapid progress. On the other hand, photofuel cells (PFCs) using
TiO2 photoanode have recently been developed as a chemical-to-electric
energy conversion device.9,10 The PFCs have attracted
considerable interest because of the availability of biomass derivatives
as the fuel, but the operation emits CO2.11,12 Meanwhile, clean one-compartment FCs can be constructed without
the expensive separator by only using H2O2 as
the fuel and oxidant.13 We have recently
reported a prototype of one-compartment H2O2-PFC consisting of mesoporous TiO2 film coated on fluorine-doped
tin oxide (mp-TiO2/FTO, photoanode), glassy carbon (cathode),
and an aqueous electrolyte solution of H2O2 (pH
3).14 In this cell, H2O2 is oxidized to O2 on the mp-TiO2/FTO
photoanode (eq 1), whereas
H2O2 is reduced to H2O at the cathode
(eq 2). 1   2  where
the electrode potentials are values
with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

Scheme 1 Solar Oxygen
Cycle with H2O2 as the Key Component
The H2O2-FC and H2O2-PFC afford a thermodynamic electromotive
force (=Ec – Ea) of 1.07 V comparable
with the value for the H2/O2-FC (1.23 V). In
addition, the H2O2-PFC has various advantages
over the H2/O2-FC, i.e., it can be easily handled
at ambient temperature and pressure and does not need separator and
electrocatalysts such as Pt. The most serious drawback common with
these PFCs is that TiO2 only responds to UV-light occupying
a few percent of the solar spectrum.15 The
photoanode material for the H2O2-PFC should
possess the following properties: (1) high visible-light activity
for H2O2 oxidation, (2) low thermocatalytic
activity for H2O2 decomposition, (3) high stability,
and (4) nontoxicity. In the biomass-PFC, the cell performances have
been improved by using a visible-light-responsive TiO2 photoanode.16,17 The simultaneous fulfillment of conditions (1) and (2) is a difficult
subject because H2O2 undergoes catalytic decomposition
by various materials. Among the visible-light-responsive semiconductor
photocatalysts, bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a promising
material because it is known to have a high level of activity for
H2O oxidation18 as well as high
stability (condition 3) and nontoxicity (condition 4),19 whereas Prussian blue (PB) can be used as the
cathode material effectively improving the cell performances of H2O2-FC20 and H2O2-PFC.21 Here, we report a
visible-light-driven one-compartment H2O2-PFC
using BiVO4/FTO photoanode and PB/FTO cathode and the performances
under simulated sunlight.

Results and Discussion
BiVO4 is an n-type semiconductor with three crystal
polymorphs, i.e., monoclinic scheelite (ms), tetragonal scheelite
(ts), and tetragonal zircon (tz) structures. Among them, ms-BiVO4 was reported to show the highest photocatalytic activity
due to its narrower band gap energy (Eg) of 2.4 eV against tz-BiVO4 with Eg = 2.9 eV22 and the more significant
distortion of the metal polyhedra than ts-BiVO4.23 The crystal form of the present BiVO4 film was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Figure 1A shows the XRD patterns
for the samples prepared at various spin-coating cycles (N). In the XRD patterns, sharp diffraction peaks are present at 2θ
= 18.9, 28.9, and 30.6°. The first peak is derived from the overlapping
of the diffraction peaks assignable to the (110) and (011) crystal
planes of ms-BiVO4, the second peak to the (1̅30),
(1̅21), and (121) planes, and the third peak to the (040) plane
(ICDD 00-014-0688). Also, the diffraction peaks observed at 26.6,
33.9, 37.9, and 51.8° are assignable to the diffraction from
the (110), (101), (200), and (211) crystal planes of SnO2 (ICDD 01-070-6995), respectively. Clearly, films consisting of single-phase
ms-BiVO4 are formed on FTO by the spin-coating technique.
As shown in the inset in Figure 1B, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image confirms
the formation of uniform ms-BiVO4 layer on the FTO surface. Figure 1B shows the relation
between the thickness of ms-BiVO4 (l)
and N. The l increases linearly
with respect to N according to the following equation
of l (nm) = 25.5N – 57.0
at N ≥ 5. In Figure 1A, the intensity of the diffraction peaks
of SnO2 monotonically decreases with an increase in N or l.

electrodes prepared at
various spin-coating cycles. (B) Plots of the thickness of BiVO4 film (l) vs the number of spin-coating cycle
(N). The inset is the cross-sectional SEM image of
the BiVO4/FTO electrode.

Raman spectra were recorded to gain information about the
bulk
and local structures of the ms-BiVO4 film. Figure 2A shows the Raman spectra for
ms-BiVO4/FTO with varying N. Every spectrum
has several signals that increase in intensity with an increase in N. In the spectrum of the sample (N = 15),
the signals at 375 and 335 cm–1 are due to the symmetric
and antisymmetric bending modes of VO43– anion (δs(VO43–) and
δas(VO43–)), respectively.
Also, the intense signal at 822 cm–1 and the weak
signal around 710 cm–1 are assignable to the symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of the VO43– anion (νs(V–O) and νas(V–O)), respectively.24 The emergence of the forbidden νas(V–O)
band can be induced by the distortion of the local symmetry of VO43– tetrahedron in ms-BiVO4. Yu
and Kudo reported that the local structure as well as crystallinity
affects the photocatalytic activity of the O2 evolution
from an AgNO3 aqueous solution.25 The absence of the νas(V–O) signal in the
spectrum of the sample (N = 5) is probably due to
the small film thickness of ∼70 nm.26Figure 2B shows the
UV–vis absorption spectra of ms-BiVO4/FTO with varying N. Every sample has a strong absorption due to the interband
transition at λ < 500 nm, whose intensity increases with
increase in N. Density functional theory calculations
for the ms-BiVO4 crystal indicated that the valence band
(VB) maximum and conduction band (CB) minimum mainly consist of the
nonbonding O 2p and nonbonding V 3d states, and the interband transition
is allowed along the polarization direction of E//a and E//c.27 The direct band gap (Eg) was determined from the [F(R∞)hν]2 vs (hν – Eg) plot,
where hν is the photon energy.28 The Eg lies in the range from
2.6 to 2.7 eV, and there is a trend that it increases with decreasing N or l. The Eg values are somewhat larger than the value of 2.45 ± 0.05 eV
reported for ms-BiVO4 particles at room temperature (Figure S1).29

inset shows the Tauc plots for the same samples.

The thermocatalytic and photocatalytic activities of TiO2 and ms-BiVO4 particles for H2O2 decomposition were examined in a deaerated 0.1 M H2O2 aqueous solution (pH 3). The rates of H2O2 decomposition in the dark and under irradiation are
denoted
as vdark and vph, respectively, below. Figure 3A compares the time courses of O2 evolution from
0.1 M H2O2 aqueous solution in the TiO2 and ms-BiVO4 systems in the dark. In the TiO2 system, the amount of O2 increases with a vdark of 0.36 μmol h–1, whereas
the decomposition is very sluggish in the ms-BiVO4 system
(vdark < 0.03 μmol h–1). Clearly, ms-BiVO4 is almost inert for H2O2 decomposition in the dark, whereas TiO2 has
a significant thermocatalytic activity.30Figure 3B shows time
courses for O2 evolution from 0.1 M H2O2 aqueous solution in the TiO2 and ms-BiVO4 systems under simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 19 mW cm–2). Irradiation of ms-BiVO4 causes H2O2 decomposition with a vph of 0.45 μmol
h–1. In the TiO2 system, O2 is produced with a vph of 0.42 μmol
h–1. The vph/vdark ratio for ms-BiVO4 reaches 16.7,
which is larger than the value for TiO2 by a factor of
14. The high level of visible-light activity (condition 1) and low
thermocatalytic activity (condition 2) of ms-BiVO4 for
the H2O2 decomposition lead us to expect its
application as the photoanode material for the H2O2-PFC. In the absence of H2O2, O2 is hardly generated in the ms-BiVO4 system (Figure S2). Previously, the flatband potential
of ms-BiVO4 or the approximate conduction band (CB) minimum
potential (ECB) was determined to be −0.064
V at pH 3 (SHE) by the slurry method.31 By using this value and the Eg of 2.60
eV, the valence band (VB) maximum potential (EVB) can be estimated to be +2.54 V at pH 3 (vs SHE). Thus,
the potential of the excited electrons in the CB of ms-BiVO4 is insufficient for H2O reduction (electrode potential, E(H2O/H2) = −0.177 V vs SHE
at pH 3),32 whereas the VB-holes can oxidize
H2O oxidation (E(O2/H2O) = +1.05 V vs SHE at pH 3).32

Figure 3 Time courses

of H2O2 in the presence of TiO2 particles
(10 mg) or BiVO4 particles (10 mg) in the dark (A) and
under illumination of simulated sunlight (B, AM 1.5, 19 mW cm–2).

To study the H2O2 additive effect on the
photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of ms-BiVO4/FTO,
three-electrode PEC cells with a structure of ms-BiVO4/FTO
(N = 5, working electrode)|deaerated aqueous electrolyte
solution containing 0.1 M NaClO4 (pH 3)|Ag/AgCl (reference
electrode)|glassy carbon (counter electrode) were fabricated, and
the photocurrent (J)–electrode potential (E) curves were measured for the cells under the illumination
of simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2, 1
sun). Figure 4A compares
the J–E curves of the ms-BiVO4/FTO electrode in the electrolyte solutions with (red) and
without 0.1 M H2O2 (black). In the H2O2-free cell, the photocurrent starts to flow around +0.4
V vs SHE. In the H2O2-cell, the photocurrent
sharply increases at the onset potential of +0.2 V vs SHE. Figure 4B shows the photochronoamperometry
curves for the PEC cells. In the H2O2-free cell,
a sharp decay in the photocurrent is observed immediately after photoirradiation.
This feature indicates that significant surface recombination occurs
via surface peroxo species generated during the H2O oxidation
by the VB-holes. On the other hand, the initial anodic photocurrent
spike and its subsequent decay disappear in the H2O2-cell, providing a very stable photocurrent. Thus, H2O2 works as an excellent scavenger for the VB-holes in
ms-BiVO4, effectively suppressing the surface recombination.33

The performance of one-compartment H2O2-PFCs
were examined for the cell with a structure of ms-BiVO4/FTO photoanode|deaerated aqueous electrolyte solution containing
0.1 M NaClO4 and 0.1 M H2O2 (pH 3)|PB/FTO
cathode under irradiation of simulated sunlight (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2, 1 sun). Figure 5A exhibits the photocurrent (J)–cell
voltage (Vcell) curves for the H2O2-PFCs using ms-BiVO4/FTO photoanodes prepared
at varying N. The J–Vcell curves are highly dependent on N. Figure 5B shows the N-dependences of the short-circuit current
(Jsc) and the open-circuit voltages (Voc). The numerical data are also summarized
in Table 1. The Jsc–N curve exhibits
a volcano shape, whereas Voc is almost
independent of N at ≥ 1. The ms-BiVO4/FTO (N = 10) photoanode cell provides Jsc = 0.81 mA cm–2 and Voc = 0.61 V much greater than the values for the mp-TiO2/FTO photoanode cell (Jsc = 0.01
mA cm–2 and Voc = 0.31
V) under the same irradiation conditions. Clearly, there exists an
optimal thickness of ms-BiVO4. These experiments were carried
out in deaerated electrolyte solution to prove that H2O2 works both as a fuel and an oxidant in this cell. However,
the presence of O2 was confirmed to hardly affect the cell
performances (Figure S3).

was ∼4 μm.

The photocurrent was measured under irradiation of monochromatic
light whose wavelength (λex) continuously varied.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was calculated by
the equation IPCE = JphNAhc/IFλ, where Jph is the photocurrent, NA is Avogadro constant, h is Planck constant, c is the speed of light, I is the light
intensity, F is Faraday constant, and λ is
the wavelength of the light. Figure 6A shows the IPCE action spectrum of the H2O2-PFC. The photocurrent rises at λex = 500 nm, which is in agreement with the absorption edge of the
ms-BiVO4/FTO electrode. Also, the IPCE action spectrum
well traces the absorption spectrum of the ms-BiVO4/FTO
electrode in Figure 2B (Figure S4). Further, the IPCE value
at λex = 400 nm reaches 6% at λex = 400 nm, which is as much as 60 times greater than the value of
the prototype of H2O2-PFC using the mp-TiO2/FTO photoanode.14 Finally, the
effect of light intensity (I) on the cell performance
was studied for the one-compartment H2O2-PFC. Figure 6B shows the maximum
power density (Pmax) as a function of I. The Pmax increases with an
increase in I to reach a saturated value of 0.13
mW cm–2 at I > 1 sun (100 mW
cm–2).

solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2, 1 sun). (B) Maximum
power density (Pmax) as a function of

The present H2O2-PFC using ms-BiVO4/FTO photoanode is considered
to operate via the mechanism explained
as follows (Scheme 2). Under irradiation of simulated sunlight, the ms-BiVO4/FTO photoanode absorbs light at λ < 500 nm and the electrons
in the VB are excited to the CB. The VB-holes (EVB = +2.44 V vs SHE at pH 3) can oxidize H2O2 to produce O2 with E(O2/H2O2) = +0.518 V vs SHE at pH 3 (eq 1).32 Importantly,
the surface recombination of the unmodified BiVO4 photoanode
can be effectively suppressed in the oxidation of H2O2, whereas it undergoes significant surface recombination in
the H2O oxidation.33 Simultaneously,
the CB-electrons (ECB = −0.064
V at pH 3 vs SHE) are transported to the FTO electrode, and further
to the PB/FTO cathode through the external circuit, taking part in
the reduction of H2O2 to H2O with E(H2O2/H2O) = +1.586 V
(vs SHE at pH 3)32 (eq 2). According to this scheme, the theoretical Voc,theo can be determined to be 1.65 V from eq 3.34 As the film thickness of ms-BiVO4 increases, the light
absorption is enhanced, whereas the probability of the electrons to
reach the the electron-collecting FTO electrode decreases due to the
recombination in the bulk. Consequently, the balance between them
would determine an optimum thickness of the ms-BiVO4 film. 3  The practical power-generating efficiency
of FCs (εFC) is expressed by eq 4.14 4  where εtheo is the theoretical
power-generating efficiency and εv and εc are the voltage efficiency and the current efficiency, respectively.

Scheme 2 Action Mechanism Proposed for the Solar-Driven H2O2-PFC Using ms-BiVO4/FTO as the Photoanode
The ECB of ms-BiVO4 was cited from ref (31), and the EVB was estimated using the ECB value and the Eg of 2.60 eV.

Because the εtheo is 119%14 and the voltage efficiency (εv) is given by 0.571
(=0.61/1.068 V) for the H2O2-PFC with N = 10, the maximum εFC can be estimated
to be 68% by assuming the current efficiency to be 100% in this H2O2-PFC. However, the Voc of the present cell (∼0.6 V) is much smaller than the Voc,theo value (1.65 V) for which the overpotential
for H2O2 reduction at the cathode is partly
responsible. Also, van de Krol and co-workers have shown that the
IPCE of the PEC cell for water splitting with BiVO4/FTO
as the photoanode can be drastically boosted by doping W6+ ions into BiVO4 and intervening a SnO2 layer
between BiVO4 and FTO.35 Thus,
there is still plenty of room for improvement in the present H2O2-PFC performances by exploring cathode materials
and enhancing the electron transport in the ms-BiVO4 film
and charge collection at the interface with the back-contact.

Conclusions
This study has shown that monoclinic scheelite (ms)-BiVO4 possesses the basic properties required for the photoanode of H2O2-PFC. A solar-driven one-compartment H2O2-PFC using ms-BiVO4 as the photoanode and
Prussian blue as the cathode provides Jsc = 0.81 mW cm–2 and Voc = 0.61 V under illumination of simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 1
sun), and the incident photon-to-current efficiency at the excitation
wavelength of 400 nm exceeds 6%. We anticipate that the performance
can be further improved by reducing the losses during the electron
transport in the photoanode and at the interface between the back-contact.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of ms-BiVO4 Particles
The BiVO4 particles were synthesized by the method reported in the
literature.36 Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 0.2 M, and 0.2 M NH4VO3 were completely dissolved in dilute nitric acid (500 mL, volume
ratio: concn HNO3/H2O = 1:4) by gentle stirring
at room temperature for 1 h. After the addition of 1.66 M urea to
the solution, the mixed solution was heated at 80 °C for 8 h.
Precursor particles thus prepared were harvested from the solution
by centrifugal separation and then repetitively washed with purified
water and vacuum dried at room temperature. The samples were then
heated at 400 °C under an air atmosphere for 1 h to form the
BiVO4 particles.

Preparation and Characterization of Electrodes
BiVO4/FTO electrodes were prepared by the metal–organic
decomposition method.37 Mixed solution
of acetic acid (15 mL) containing 0.6 mol/L Bi(NO3)3·5H2O and acetylacetone (75 mL) containing
0.04 M VO(acac)2 was spin-coated on fluorine-doped tin
oxide (FTO) film-coated glass substrate (20 × 20 mm2, <10 Ω/sq) at a rotation speed of 500 rpm for 30 s at room
temperature. After this process was repeatedly conducted for N cycles, the as-obtained films were heated in air at 673
K for 4h to form BiVO4/FTO. The film thickness of BiVO4/FTO was determined by cross-sectional SEM observation of
the photoanode with Hitachi S-4800 Type II. The PB films were electrochemically
deposited on FTO (PB/FTO) from an aqueous mixed solution of 0.02 M
FeCl3·6H2O and 0.02 M K3[Fe(CN)6] according to the method described in the literature.38 Electrodeposition of the PB films on FTO was
conducted by flowing a constant current of −40 μA cm–2 for 10 min. The film thickness (lPB) was estimated to be 0.94 μm. The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) analysis was carried out with a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer.
Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra of the photoanodes were
recorded on a UV-2600 spectrometer (Shimadzu) with integrating sphere
unit (Shimadzu, ISR-2600Plus) at room temperature. The reflectance
(R∞) of the photoanodes was measured
with respect to a standard sample (BaSO4), and the Kubelka–Munk
function (F(R∞)) defined by the equation of F(R∞) = (1 – R∞)2/2R∞ was plotted
against the wavelength. The Raman spectroscopy was carried out with
a JASCO NRS-1000 laser Raman spectrometer at room temperature. Green
laser with an emission wavelength of 532 nm was used as an excitation
source.

Photocatalytic Decomposition of H2O2
Deaerated aqueous solutions of 0.1 M H2O2 solutions (10 mL, pH 3) containing BiVO4 powder (10 mg,
specific surface area = 0.673 m2 g–1)
were irradiated by simulated sunlight without (AM 1.5, 19 mW cm–2) and with an optical cutoff filter (λ >
430
nm, AM 1.5, 15 mW cm–2) at 25 °C. The amount
of O2 was determined by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, GC-8A).14 For comparison, the same experiments were carried
out using anatase TiO2 particles (10 mg, specific surface
area = 309 m2 g–1, ST-01, Ishihara Sangyo).

Evaluation of Photofuel Cell Performances
The photoelectrochemical
(PEC) response of the photoanodes incorporated in three-electrode
PEC cells was evaluated by the measurements of current (J)–electrode potential (E) curves and decay
curves of photocurrent at the rest potential under the irradiation
of simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm–2, 1
sun). Current (J)–cell voltage (Vcell) curves and power density–J curves were measured to determine the cell performance of two-electrode
H2O2 PFCs. The action spectra of the incident
photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) were measured by the
same method as recently reported.14
