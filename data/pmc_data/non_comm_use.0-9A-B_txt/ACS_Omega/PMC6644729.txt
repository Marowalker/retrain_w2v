In
the present work, we selected hexamethylcucurbit[3,3]uril (Me6Q[3,3]) as a building block and obtained two Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies from neutral water
(A) and aqueous HCl solutions (B), respectively.
Both Me6Q[3,3]-based assemblies are constructed of Me6Q[3,3] molecules through the typical outer surface interaction
of cucurbit[n]urils, as well as hydrogen bonding
between latticed water molecules and portal carbonyl oxygens of Me6Q[3,3]. The assemblies present different porous structure
features and exhibit different adsorption properties for eight common
volatile organic compounds. However, the two porous assemblies exhibit
similar adsorption properties for certain fluorophore dyes, including
rhodamine B (G1), fluorescein (G2), and
pyrene (G3), and form solid colored fluorescent compounds,
some of which exhibit responses to the selected volatile organic compounds.

Introduction
Novel structural features
and properties make porous materials
attractive for use in many applications including biomedical bone
substitution,1−7 gas separation or sequestration,8−10 seawater desalination,8 natural gas storage,8 sensors,11 catalysis,12,13 metal ion batteries,14,15 and electrochemical energy conversion
and storage.16 Porous materials can be
composed of organic, inorganic, or mixed substrates, including organic
membranes for gas separation,9 porous organic
polymers for carbon capture,17,18 TiO2-based
porous adsorbents for photocatalysts,19 nanoporous metals as electrocatalysts,20,21 polyethylene/metal-oxide nanocomposites for ultrahigh-voltage insulating
materials,22 metal/porous carbon composites
for heterogeneous catalysis,12 metal–organic
frameworks,23−25 and cation–anion coordination supramolecular
assemblies.26 Some porous materials are
composed of macrocyclic compounds as building blocks, such as cyclodextrins
with metal ions and inorganic nanoparticles,27 and pillar[6]arene-based crystalline or amorphous materials for
selectively capture of styrene from mixtures.28

Cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s)
are
a unique class of macrocyclic compounds first reported by Behrend
in 190529 and structurally assigned as
Q[6] by Mock in 198130 and Q[5–8]
by Day and Kim in 2000.31,32 Although Q[n] chemistry has a shorter history than other macrocyclic
compounds, such as crown ethers, cyclodextrins, and calix[n]arenes, Q[n]-based porous materials are
attracting much attention because of their novel structures, which
form rigid cavities with a depth of 9.1 Å, and portals ranging
in size from 4.4 to 10.7 Å. Additionally, the positive electro-potential
outer surface of cucurbit[n]urils could be thought
to be an important driving force in the formation of Q[n]-based porous materials, and it is referred to as the outer surface
interaction of cucurbit[n]urils.33 For example, Kim and co-workers described Q[6]- or Q[8]-based
supramolecular assemblies with numerous porous channels that can capture
acetylene molecules34 and carbon dioxide,35 and display anisotropic proton conductivity.36 More recently, Li and co-workers demonstrated
a series of Q[8]-based water-soluble periodic supramolecular organic
frameworks exhibiting antimicrobial activity and the ability to adsorb
anionic organic dyes, drugs, peptides, nucleic acids, and other molecules.37 In recent years, we also developed a series
of Q[n]-based porous supramolecular assemblies that
can recognize for lanthanides38,39 and absorb various
volatile compounds,40−42 including Q[10]-based porous supramolecular assemblies
that take up fluorescent dyes and form solid fluorescent materials,43 which could be used as fluorescent sensors for
the detection of explosives, chemical agents, and pesticides.44

In the present work, we selected hexamethylcucurbit[3,3]uril
(Me6Q[3,3]) as the building block (Figure 1)45 and obtained
two Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies (A and B) by simple crystallization in neutral
water (A) and aqueous 1 M HCl solution (B), respectively. Although the two Me6Q[3,3]-based assemblies
are constructed of Me6Q[3,3] molecules through typical
outer surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils, hydrogen
bonding between latticed water molecules and portal carbonyl oxygens
of Me6Q[3,3] are also important.33 The assemblies display different porous structural features and
exhibit different adsorption properties. Moreover, the Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies exhibit intense colored
fluorescence after absorbing the fluorophores rhodamine B (G1), fluorescein (G2), and pyrene (G3) (Figure 1), suggesting that
they could be used to fabricate solid fluorescent materials.

Results and Discussion
Description of the Crystal
Structures of the Compounds
In general, a metal- or guest-free
cucurbit[n]uril
can form different supramolecular assemblies in different media through
the outer surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils.33 In the present work, we obtained two of Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies with different
crystal structures in neutral water (A) and aqueous HCl
solution (B), respectively. Both are constructed of Me6Q[3,3] molecules and include similar interactions between
Me6Q[3,3] molecules and latticed water molecules, suggesting
that both outer surface interactions of cucurbit[n]urils and hydrogen bonding are the driving forces resulting in the
formation of Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies.
A close inspection revealed that each Me6Q[3,3] molecule
interacts with six Me6Q[3,3] molecules in both A and B (Figure 2a,b), and interactions include (1) a dipole interaction between
portal carbonyl oxygens of a Me6Q[3,3] molecule and portal
carbonyl carbons of neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules, with
distances of 2.752 Å between neighboring carbonyl oxygen and
carbonyl carbons (Figure 2c); (2) dipole interactions between portal carbonyl oxygens
of a Me6Q[3,3] molecule and positive electro-potential
methine, methylene and methyl groups on the outer surface of neighboring
Me6Q[3,3] molecules, with distances of 2.594–2.894
Å between carbonyl oxygens and protons of methine, methylene,
and methyl groups of neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules (Figure 2c,d). An additional
interaction involves hydrogen bonding between latticed water molecules
and portal carbonyl oxygens of neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules
and dipole interactions between latticed water molecules and positive
electro-potential methine, methylene, and methyl groups on the outer
surface of neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules are also present
(omitted for clarity). Despite the similar interactions between Me6Q[3,3] molecules in compounds A and B, the assemblies of Me6Q[3,3] molecules in compounds A and B are distinct. In compound A, the three top Me6Q[3,3] molecules in green are offset
relative to the three bottom Me6Q[3,3] molecules in blue
in Figure 2a, whereas
the three top Me6Q[3,3] molecules in green overlap the
three bottom Me6Q[3,3] molecules in B in blue
in Figure 2b. In addition,
the Figure 2e shows
that the Me6Q[3,3]-based supramolecular assembly in compound A includes numerous channels, each of which is constructed
by the overlapping Me6Q[3,3] molecules, and this section
of the channel portal is controlled by the portal size of the Me6Q[3,3] molecule. The distance between the two closed portals
of two neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules in a channel is
about 13 Å and spaces are filled with a large number of water
molecules (Figure 2g) and Figure 2i shows
a topologic assembly of A. Figure 2f shows another Me6Q[3,3]-based
supramolecular assembly with two different channels in compound B, one of which is also constructed from the overlapping Me6Q[3,3] molecules, and this section of the channel portal is
also controlled by the portal size of the Me6Q[3,3] molecule.
The distance between the two closed portals of two neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules in a channel is about 9.6 Å, and spaces
are filled relatively few water molecules (Figure 2h). Every six Me6Q[3,3]-based
columns are constructed from a larger channel with a section of about
25.4 Å2, in which chloride anions and latticed water
molecules are included and interact with the outer surface of Me6Q[3,3]. Figure 2j shows topologic assembly of B.

a Me6Q[3,3] molecule with six neighboring

assemblies of compounds A and B; (g,h) related
positions of neighboring Me6Q[3,3] molecules in a channel

Powder X-ray diffraction analysis
of A and B accompanied by simulations revealed
that the bulk of the samples
essentially consisted of pure crystalline phases (Supporting Information Figure S1). Analysis of the thermal
stabilities of A and B by differential scanning
calorimetry and thermogravimetry (Supporting Information Figure S2) revealed that for air-dried A, water molecules
were first eliminated from the crystals, accounting for weight losses
of ∼12% (calcd 25.00%) when the temperature was increased from
ambient to about ∼180 °C. Further weight losses were observed
upon heating to 280 °C, and rapid weight losses were incurred
at ∼350 °C. For air-dried B, the equivalent
figure was 10.09% (calcd 27.48%); water molecules initially from crystals
accounted for ∼11% weight losses (from ambient to about ∼100
°C), ∼13% losses occurred during the second stage (from
100 to about 200 °C, calcd 25.00%), with further weight losses
starting at 250 °C, and rapid weight losses at 340 °C.

Adsorption Properties of Me6Q[3,3]-Based Porous Supramolecular
Assemblies
Single-crystal structural analysis revealed that
the porous structures of the two Me6Q[3,3]-based supramolecular
assemblies (A and B) could sequester volatile
organic molecules or dyes, suggesting that they could be classified
as adsorption materials34,35,40−42 or solid fluorescent materials.43 Interestingly, different channels and cages were observed
in the two Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies,
and the BET surface areas of activated A and B, as calculated from the isotherms, were 4.73 and 6.41 m2·g–1, respectively (Supporting Information Figures S3 and S4). We also determined the adsorption
capacity of the two porous assemblies for some typical volatile compounds
(Figure 3a,b and Supporting Information Table S1). The experimental
results revealed that porous assembly A exhibits a higher
adsorption capacity for the methanol (0.33 g/g) compared with 0.17
for porous assembly B, whereas porous assembly B exhibits a higher adsorption capacity for polychloromethanes,
(0.32 g for dichloromethane, 0.35 g for trichloromethane, and 0.22
g for tetrachloromethane) compared with 0.13, 0.14, and 0.11 g for
porous assembly A (Supporting Information Table S1).

dichloromethane, (◆) trichloromethane, (◀) tetrachloromethane,
(■) diethyl ether.

We also tested the uptakes of different dyes by porous assemblies A and B, with the intention of identifying that
can induce fluorescence emissions of three primary colors. After numerous
attempts to select suitable dyes, we identified three rhodamine B
(G1), fluorescein (G2), and pyrene (G3), yielding red, green, and blue fluorescence emissions,
respectively, upon interaction with porous assemblies A or B. Adsorption capacity experiments were performed
by immersing Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies
in an acetonitrile solution containing one of the three dyes, respectively.
The quantity of dye extracted from solution was then measured using 1H NMR to monitor the integrity of the Me6Q[3,3]-based
assembly before and after extracting the dye (Supporting Information Figure S5 and Table S2).

Although
porous assemblies A and B exhibited
different adsorption properties for volatile compounds, they displayed
similar fluorescence emission after adsorbing an identical dye. For
example, loading porous assemblies A or B with G1 (G1/A or G1/B) yielded a pink powder under daylight, and intense
red fluorescence emission with maximum intensity peaks at 615 and
625 nm, respectively, compared with pale yellow powder for G1 under daylight and weak dark red fluorescence emission with a maximum
intensity peak at 683 nm under 365 UV light. Moreover, the intensity
of the fluorescence emission of G1/A or G1/B was increased about fivefold compared with
that of free solid G1 (Figure 4). Loading porous assemblies A or B with G2 (G2/A or G2/B) yielded a pale yellow power under
daylight, and an intense green fluorescence emission with a maximum
intensity peak at the same position of 561 nm for both G2/A and G2/B systems, and the
intensity of the fluorescence emission of G2/A or G2/B was increased by over 10-fold
(Supporting Information Figure S6). Loading
porous assemblies A or B with G3 (G3/A or G3/B), respectively, yielded a white powder under daylight and a blue
fluorescence emission with maximum intensity peaks at 472 and 470
nm, respectively (Supporting Information Figure S7). These results suggest that porous assemblies A or B might provide different spaces for the smaller
volatile molecules and the larger dye molecules or identical spaces
for both the smaller volatile molecules and the larger dye molecules.
The significant enhancement in fluorescence emission of G1 and G2 upon interaction with the porous assemblies
suggests that rotation of phenyl groups is constrained, and a larger
π system is formed. Given that the empty cavity of Me6Q[3,3] could include not only the smaller volatile molecules but
also larger dye molecules, we investigated the interactions of these
three dyes with Me6Q[3,3] in more detail using 1H NMR titration experiments. The results revealed that Me6Q[3,3] could not accommodate the selected dye guests because of their
larger size (Supporting Information Figure
S8). Thus, the Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular assemblies
could accommodate only dye guests in the channels or holes or gaps
constructed form Me6Q[3,3] molecules via the outer surface
interactions of cucurbit[n]urils. Further adsorption
experiments on the fluorescent compounds with selected volatile compounds
revealed that the adsorption capacity of G/A and G/B was not significantly affected
by the uptake of dyes. Supporting Information Figure S9 shows typical adsorption profiles of G1/A and G1/B for diethyl ether and
tetrachloromethane, respectively. The adsorption capacity for diethyl
ether is 0.050 g for G1/A and 0.038 g for G1/B; and for tetrachloromethane is 0.100 g for G1/A, and 0.216 g for G1/B (Supporting Information Table S3). A
comparison of the adsorption capacities of A or B (Supporting Information Table
S1) versus G/A or G/B (Supporting Information Table S3) for
the corresponding volatile compounds revealed no obvious differences,
suggesting that the Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular
assemblies could provide different spaces to accommodate the selected
volatile compounds and fluorophore dyes or spaces large enough to
accommodate both the selected volatile compounds and fluorophore dyes.

of the colors of G1/A, G1/B, and G1 under UV light (365
nm) and daylight, respectively; (b) fluorescence spectra of solid G1 (λexc = 683 nm), G1/A (λexc = 625 nm), and G1/B (λexc = 615 nm), respectively.

Interestingly, the adsorption experiments on selected
volatile
compounds revealed that some G/A or G/B compounds could respond to certain volatile
compounds. Immersing G/A or G/B compounds in the selected volatile compounds revealed
that G1/A or G1/B responds to diethyl ether and tetrachloromethane by quenching fluorescence
emission, whereas G2/A or G2/B responds to methanol and ethanol by enhancing of
fluorescence emission (Supporting Information Figure S10). Detailed experiments showed that the solid fluorescence
emission of G1/A or G1/B was gradually quenched with increasing adsorption time,
and the solid fluorescence emission of G2/A or G2/B was gradually enhanced with increasing
adsorption time (Figure 5 and Supporting Information Figure S11).

Figure 5 Comparison
of the colors of (a,c,e) G1/A, G1/B, and G1 after adsorbing
diethyl ether, or tetrachloromethane under UV light (365 nm) and (b,d,f) G2/A, G2/B, and G2 after adsorbing methanol or ethanol under UV light (365
nm).

To confirm that the color of fluorescent
species was conferred
by the three primary-colored fluorescent compounds, we generated a
typical color band from a red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue,
violet, and white fluorescent mixture using G1/A or G1/B, G2/A or G2/B, and G2/A or G2/B, (Supporting Information Figure S12).

Recyclability tests
on the G/A or G/B porous material revealed that they were quite
stable, maintaining a sorption capacity for methanol and ethanol,
respectively (Supporting Information Figure
S13).

Conclusion
In summary, we selected Me6Q[3,3]
as a building block
and prepared two Me6Q[3,3]-based porous supramolecular
assemblies by simply crystallization in neutral water (A) and aqueous HCl solutions (B), respectively. Crystal
structure analysis showed that the two Me6Q[3,3]-based
assemblies present different porous structural features, and the driving
force for assembly included both so called the outer surface interactions
of cucurbit[n]urils and hydrogen bonding between
latticed water molecules and portal carbonyl oxygens of Me6Q[3,3]. The assemblies exhibit different adsorption properties, including
the adsorption of properties for some typical volatile organic compounds.
The assemblies displayed similar adsorption properties for certain
fluorophore dyes and could be used to fabricate solid fluorescent
materials with different colored fluorescence emission such as rhodamine
B (G1) with red fluorescence emission, fluorescein (G2) with green fluorescence emission, and pyrene (G3) with blue fluorescence emission. Interestingly, some solid fluorescent
materials could respond to certain volatile organic compounds by quenching
or enhancing the strength of fluorescence emission. These assemblies
could therefore be used to fabricate solid fluorescent materials and
demonstrate how Q[n]-based supramolecular chemistry
can contribute to porous materials and light emitters. More extensive
investigations on these Q[n]-based supramolecular
assemblies and their functions are currently underway.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Me6Q[3,3] was prepared in our
laboratory according to a literature method.45 All other chemicals were of analytical grade, obtained from Aladdin,
and used as received without further purification.

Measurements
All 1H NMR spectra, including
those for titration experiments, were recorded at 20 °C in D2O on a JEOL JNM-ECZ400s spectrometer.

Preparation of Me6Q[3,3]-Based Supramolecular Assemblies A and B
Me6Q[3,3] (0.126
g, 0.1 mmol) solids were dissolved in neutral water or aqueous HCl
solution (1–3 M). Colorless crystals (A) were
obtained in neutral water in 5 days with the a yield of 0.102 g (81%),
whereas colorless crystals (B) were obtained in aqueous
HCl solution in 2 days with a yield of 0.100 g (80%).

Preparation
of Dye/Me6Q[3,3] Solid-State Fluorescent
Materials (G/A and G/B)
Me6Q[3,3] crystals (10.0 mg) of A or B was added to 0.5 mL of 5 × 10–3 M dye in acetonitrile solution, stirred for 1 min,
filtered, and solid materials displaying different colored fluorescence
were obtained; for rhodamine B (G1) to yield G1/A and G1/B, the color was
red, for fluorescein (G2) to yield G2/A and G2/B, the color was green,
and for pyrene (G3) to yield G3/A and G3/B, the color was blue.

Adsorption
of Selected Volatile Compounds by Me6Q[3,3]-Based
Supramolecular Assemblies A, B, G/A, and G/B
The solid
assembly (0.5–1.0 g) was tared in an open glass phial and added
to a glass vessel, which was then evacuated using a vacuum pump. Pumping
was continued until the sample achieved a constant weight. A second
open container containing a few milliliters of volatile liquid (methanol,
ethanol, n-hexane, diethyl ether, acetonitrile, dichloromethane,
trichloromethane, tetrachloromethane, and acetone) was then added
and the vessel was resealed. The weight change of the sample was then
determined at 0.25–1 h intervals over 24 h to obtain the vapor
absorption profile.

Measurement of Fluorescence Spectra of Solid G/A and G/B
Fluorescence
spectra of solid G/A, G/B before and after adsorbing volatile compounds were recorded
at 25 °C using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrofluorometer (Varian,
Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively.
