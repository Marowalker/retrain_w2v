As
nanomaterials are dominating 21st century’s scene, multiple
functionality in a single (nano)structure is becoming very appealing.
Inspired by the Land of the Rising Sun, we designed a bifunctional
(gas-sensor/photochromic) nanomaterial, made with TiO2 whose
surface was simultaneously decorated with copper and silver (the Cu/Ag
molar ratio being 3:1). This nanomaterial outperformed previous state-of-the-art
TiO2-based sensors for the detection of acetone, as well
as the Cu–TiO2-based photochromic material. It indeed
possessed splendid sensitivity toward acetone (detection limit of
100 ppb, 5 times lower than previous state-of-the-art TiO2-based acetone sensors), as well as reduced response/recovery times
at very low working temperature, 150 °C, for acetone sensing.
Still, the same material showed itself to be able to (reversibly)
change in color when stimulated by both UV-A and, most remarkably,
visible light. Indeed, the visible-light photochromic performance
was almost 3 times faster compared to the standard Cu–TiO2 photochromic material—that is, 4.0 min versus 10.8
min, respectively. It was eventually proposed that the photochromic
behavior was triggered by different mechanisms, depending on the light
source used.

1 Introduction
As
nanostructured materials are dominating the scene in the 21st
Century, their potential influence on future products and services
is enormous. This has led to a huge advance in research and development
efforts related to nanoscale materials and devices. As such, researchers
are willing to engineer complex multifunctional and, to a certain
degree, smart devices and systems. There is consequently a request
for a higher level of complexity in materials design, that is, in
other words, combining multiple functionalities in the same nanostructure.1

Metal oxides (MOs) are a very important
family of nanomaterials,
having unique properties and advantageous functionalities that clearly
are attractive for a number of applications ranging from electronic
devices to energy conversion.2 Titanium
dioxide (titania, TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs), because of
their versatility, are a well-investigated class of MOs. Indeed, they
are widely used in everyday applications, becoming by far the most
popular material in light-to-energy conversion and storage.3 The “sun” of TiO2 as
photocatalyst rose indeed in Japan more than 4 decades ago, when a
paper by Honda and Fujishima about semiconductor photo-electrochemistry
was published in 1972.4 This initiated
research on liquid junction solar cells and semiconductor-assisted
photocatalysis.5 The photocatalytic (PC)
mechanism is now well known: when the surface of a semiconductor material
is irradiated with photons having energy higher than or equal to its
band gap energy (Eg), photo-electrons
e– and photo-holes h+ are generated.6 Taking advantage of this phenomenon, multifunctional
nanomaterials might be engineered—that is, simultaneous PC
and antibacterial activities have been shown to exist in silver-modified
titania.7

Furthermore, Japan was
also the cradle of that phenomenon that
was named “multicolour photochromism”
by their discoverers, Tatsuma’s group and, once again, Fujishima’s
group.8 This was found exploiting the PC
phenomenon in anatase TiO2 films loaded with silver NPs
when triggered by UV-light. This outcome led Parkin et al. to demonstrate
a relationship between the photochromic state of a Ag–TiO2 thin-film and its UV-light PC activity,9 thus showing multifunctionality within the Ag–TiO2 system. Following on from these findings, Tobaldi and co-authors,
first reported the photochromism and PC activity of multifunctional
silver-modified TiO2 NPs, triggered by a purely visible
white-light.10 It has also been recently
shown that a nanomaterial exhibiting reversible color properties can
be engineered by coupling copper and TiO2, and the redox
process from Cu2+ to Cu+ linked to a change
in color, can be simply controlled by regulating the light source
(UV or visible light) and exposure time.11 Hence, decorating titania with a noble metal can yield to a purely
inorganic photochromic noble-metal/MO hybrid nanomaterial. Conversely,
most of the existing photochromic systems are based on polymers or
organogels containing organic moieties, thus displaying limitations
for being implemented on commercial devices.12

Besides, TiO2 nanomaterials have also been extensively
employed for sensing applications,3 because
of their unique chemical and physical properties as well as the nontoxic
and environmentally friendly nature, excellent biocompatibility, and
stability. In particular, it has been widely demonstrated that resistive
gas sensors based on TiO2 nanostructures are highly effective
in detecting both reducing [i.e., H2, CO, volatile organic
compounds (VOCs)],13 and oxidizing (e.g.,
NO2, O3) gases.14 TiO2 nanostructures—because of the extremely high
surface to volume ratio and their ability to absorb reactive oxygen
species at their surface15—can provide
a large number of active sites for the interaction with the gas, thus
resulting in high sensitivity. Despite this, some drawback related
to high working temperatures and long recovery times are the main
disadvantages of that material.3 Modifications
of TiO2 by doping and/or the formation of metal/TiO2 or MO/TiO2 heterostructures are amongst the simplest
ways to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity yet shortening the
response/recovery times.16

Our previous
works were inspired by light and its ability to trigger
redox reactions on the surface of a semiconductor nanomaterial when
this is decorated with noble-metals NPs (i.e., silver and copper,
as in refs (10) and (11), respectively). Those
redox reactions are indeed associated to a reversible change in color
of the (photochromic) material. Color is definitely an essential characteristic
of Japanese traditional metal art and craft.17

As a result, this research was greatly inspired by the Land
of
the Rising Sun—photocatalysis,4 photochromism,8 and Japanese traditional alloys.17Shibuichi—a copper–silver
alloy used mainly for sword ornaments, that is, tsuba—is one of the most representative Japanese traditional alloys. Shibuichi means literally “one-fourth”, to indicate its standard formulation of a copper alloy
containing 25% of silver.17 Hence, we designed
a multifunctional photochromic/gas-sensing nanomaterial, made with
TiO2 decorated expressly with copper and silver having
the Cu/Ag molar ratio constrained to be 3:1—that is, one part
of Ag, and three parts of Cu. As far as we know, this is the first
research of its kind involving multifunctionality (i.e., UV and most
remarkably visible-light photochromism as well as gas-sensing properties)
on TiO2 modified with Ag NPs and CuxO nanoclusters, certainly without neglecting the particular
ratio of the noble metals used in here. As a matter of fact, previous
research works involved TiO2 modified with Cu and Ag, but
solely with a view limited to PC or antibacterial applications.18,19

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 QPA and
Microstructural Analyses: XRD and
HR-STEM
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the specimens
are shown in Figure 1. Results of the XRD-quantitative phase analysis (QPA) analysis are
listed in Table 1,
and a graphical output of a Rietveld QPA refinement is shown in Figure S1. Unmodified titania is composed of
all the three main natural occurring TiO2 polymorphs/anatase
(56.5 wt %), rutile (19.8 wt %), and brookite (23.6 wt %). The presence
of brookite has to be linked to the strongly acidic synthesis conditions.20 The modification with both copper and silver
led to a huge decrease in the weight fraction of rutile and brookite,
meaning a delay in the anatase-to-rutile phase transition (ART). Specimen SBC1, for instance, is composed of 94.5 wt % anatase, 4.4
wt % rutile, and 1.2 wt % brookite. By contrast, SBC10 contains 93.7 wt % anatase, 3.7 wt % rutile, and 2.6 wt % brookite,
see Table 1. Actually,
in Shibuichi specimens, the trend with the increase
in the Ag + Cu mol % content is a slight decrease in the anatase and
rutile fractions (from 94.5 to 93.7 wt %, and from 4.4 to 3.7 wt %,
respectively) and a small increase in brookite amount—from
1.2 to 2.6 wt %. The delay in the ART, when including Ag + Cu in the
system, can be explained as being caused by a grain-boundary pinning
(Zener drag),21 which culminates in delaying
the ART—that is a nucleation-growth mechanism.22 Microstructural information, as extracted by means of whole
powder pattern modeling (WPPM), is listed in Tables 2 and 3; an example
of WPPM graphical output is shown in Figure S2. From the negligible differences in unit cell volumes, it can be
inferred that neither Cu nor Ag entered the TiO2 lattice.
Indeed, the ionic radii of [VI]Cu1+/2+, [VI]Ag1+/2+, and [VI]Ti4+ are
0.77/0.73, 1.15/0.94, and 0.61 Å, respectively.23 Modification of TiO2 with Ag + Cu also led to
a decrease in the mean average diameter of the crystalline domains,
cf Table 3 and Figure 2a–c. Anatase
domains in unmodified TiO2 have an average diameter of
10.4 nm, rutile of 14.4 nm, and brookite averages of 7.0 nm. Shibuichi modification of TiO2 led not only to
smaller crystalline domain diameters, but also to narrower size distribution
of those crystalline domains, refer to Table 3 and Figure 2a–c. The average crystalline domain diameter
in anatase and rutile that are in SBC1 is 6.7 and 11.2
nm, respectively; on the other hand, that of anatase and rutile in SBC10 is 4.6 nm for both the polymorphs. This outcome means
that copper and silver NPs likely nucleate on the grain boundaries,
pinning them, thus limiting their further growth. This also explains
the observed delay of the ART and crystal growth. The decrease in
the size of anatase nanocrystals is also confirmed by Raman analysis:
the Raman Eg mode of anatase is shifted
toward higher energies in the Ag + Cu specimens, thus confirming their
reduced dimensions (cf Table S1).24

High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM)
experiments were performed on the Shibuichi samples
with the highest Ag + Cu concentrations (SBC5 and SBC10) in order to investigate the possible formation of a
metallic@TiO2 heterostructure and to determine their morphology
and microstructure. Figure 3a shows a low-magnification STEM–high-angle annular
dark-field imaging (HAADF) micrograph of the sample SBC5, in which two distinct kinds of NPs, displaying two distinct contrasts,
can be clearly seen. A single NP displaying a brighter contrast (highlighted
by the green arrow) can be observed in contact with a matrix of agglomerated
NPs showing a darker contrast. NPs displaying the brighter contrast
are scarce and hard to find. To get more information on the nature
of the NPs, they were investigated by a combination of energy dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) techniques,
that is, a powerful tool to extract structural and chemical information
at the nanoscale.25 A darker contrast in
STEM–HAADF images highlights materials having lower atomic
number and/or lower mass density and/or lower thickness. Thus, these
NPs showing a darker contrast correspond to TiO2 NPs. This
is confirmed by the EDS spectrum acquired on these NPs (displayed
in red in Figure 3b).
The EDS spectrum acquired at the center of the brighter particle (displayed
in blue in Figure 3b) highlights the presence of Ag. It has to be highlighted that Cu
signal can be seen in both the NPs. However, Cu signal can emerge
from the specimen, but it might also come from the TEM sample-holder
or even from the TEM column, thus making a univocal conclusion difficult. Figure 3c displays the HR-STEM
ADF micrograph of a facetted NP standing in the vacuum and showing
a brighter contrast. These NPs have a diameter typically between 7
and 10 nm and, as it can be clearly seen from Figure 3c, they are crystalline. Automatic indexation
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (displayed in the inset)
performed on one of the facet revealed that the NP corresponds to
the Ag face-centered cubic structure in the [011] zone axis. Same
results have been obtained on all the investigated NPs, showing this
kind of bright contrast. This is also confirmed by the EDS spectrum
acquired at the center of the NP (displayed in Figure 3d), which highlights the presence of the
Ag lines. A HR-STEM–HAADF micrograph of the TiO2 NPs is shown in Figure S3. All of the
TiO2 NPs are crystalline with a diameter between 1.8 and
8 nm. A similar analysis is shown in Figure S4 for SBC10 sample. The surface of this sample is flecked
due to the presence of smaller but more abundant Ag NPs (diameter
between 1.5 and 8 nm). These results are in good agreement with the
WPPM modeling and clearly show the formation of (at least) an Ag@TiO2 heterojunction for the Shibuichi samples.

2.2 Optical
Properties: Photochromism
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS) spectra of fresh un-irradiated
samples are depicted in Figure 4. As per Ti450, a single absorption band is observable
at <360 nm, due to the band-to-band transition in titania.26Shibuichi-modified specimens,
besides these bands, also display other absorption features. The absorption
band located at >600 nm is assigned to the d–d electronic
transitions
in Cu2+. The absorption at around 450 nm belongs to the
electron transferring from the valence band (VB) of TiO2 to CuxO clusters that are around titania
(interfacial charge transfer, IFCT);27,28 consistent
with what was reported in an earlier work, this IFCT band increases
itself as the amount of Cu in the specimens increases.11 Furthermore, when the Cu amount is higher than
1.50 mol % (i.e., specimens SBC5 and SBC10), an absorption tail extending itself up to ∼575 nm, assigned
to interband absorptions in Cu2O, is also noticeable.29,30 Optical signatures of metallic Ag0 (i.e., the surface
plasmon resonance band, SPR) are not seen at this un-irradiated stage.
This is likely because silver is present as Ag2O, thus
displaying just its IFCT feature mingling itself with that of CuxO clusters around TiO2.31

Figure 4 Absorption data, derived by Kubelka–Munk analysis,
of the
optical spectra (un-irradiated specimens).

When the Ag + Cu-modified specimens are exposed to UV-A light,
progressive changes are observable to their optical spectra, as shown
in Figure S5a–d. As per SBC1, as the UV-A irradiation time increases, there is also a gradual
decrease in the Cu2+ d–d band, thus being accompanied
by a continuing increase in the band due to the IFCT. Interestingly,
with only 0.25 s of UV-A irradiation time, also the band belonging
to the interband absorptions in Cu2O starts to appear (and
its magnitude increases with the irradiation time as well). These
phenomena imply that upon UV-A irradiation, the Cu2+ is
swiftly and gradually reduced to its cuprous oxidation state.11 There is also no signature of the appearance
of the Ag0 SPR band, likely because of the much reduced
amount of silver. With higher mol % amounts of Ag + Cu (specimens SBC2, SBC5, and SBC10), qualitatively
the same change in the optical features as in SBC1 was
observed. It is worth to highlight that the SPR band in Ag0 is not detected even with higher amounts of silver, probably because
the optical bands of copper cover that of Ag0 SPR. However,
an indirect evidence of the reduction of silver into Ag0 after light exposure is given by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Figure S6, the Raman signal is enhanced in the
specimen that has been subjected to UV-A irradiation, thus indeed
proving the presence, in this latter, of metallic Ag, giving rise
to the surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect.32

These changes in the optical properties (i.e., photochromism)
are
caused, mechanistically, by the PC process in titania: when TiO2 specimens are irradiated with a light having supra Eg energy, the electron that migrated to the
conduction band (CB) is able to reduce the CuO oxides (and allegedly
also the Ag2O) that are clustered around the semiconductor
surface. Looking at the evolution of the increase in the IFCT band
area in the Shibuichi samples after UV-A irradiation, Figure 5a–d, it is
seen that these all follow a third-order exponential function, for
all the Ag + Cu modified specimens. This being partly consistent with
our previous investigations: indeed, when dealing only with copper-modified
TiO2 and Ag–TiO2 NPs, the best fit was
always obtained adopting a double exponential function.11,31 This suggesting that, in the case of Ag + Cu modified TiO2, the simultaneous adoption of two noble metals increases the degree
of complexity of the photochromic phenomenon—there is indeed
an electron “pumping” from TiO2 to CuO and
Ag2O NPs decorating it.

Figure 5 Evolution of the increase in the IFCT
band area in the Shibuichi samples after UV-A irradiation.
(a) SBC1; (b) SBC2; (c) SBC5; and (d) SBC10. The coefficients of determination R2 of the third-order exponential function adopted
for the fittings
were ≥0.9984.

When specimens are irradiated with the white lamp, the same
changes
in the optical properties happen, though in a lesser extent, Figure S7a–d. This is better shown in Figure 6a–d, and in Table 4, where is listed
the time needed to halve the IFCT integrated area—data obtained
using both UV-A and visible light are compared. As listed in Table 4, for instance, the
time to reach half of the IFCT integrated area in SBC1 using the UV-A radiation is equal to 0.23 min, while, with the visible
light, that time is 4.04 min (∼18 times faster using the UV-A
lamp). This latter is indeed a striking result, being the time to
halve the IFCT-integrated area in a specimen made only of 1 mol %
Cu and TiO2 and using the very same visible-light source,
equal to 10.8 min11—that is, almost
3 times faster by adding only 0.25 mol % of silver and decreasing
from 1 to 0.75 mol % the Cu content.

band area in the Shibuichi samples after visible-light
exposure. (a) SBC1; (b) SBC2; (c) SBC5; and (d) SBC10. The coefficients of determination R2 of the third-order exponential function adopted
for
the fittings were ≥0.9923.

Table 4 Time to Reach One-Half of the Final
Extent of the Integrated IFCT Area, After UV-A and Vis-Light Irradiation
 	t1/2 IFCT band (min)	
sample	UV-A	Vis-light	
SBC1	0.23	4.04	
SBC2	0.44	11.96	
SBC5	4.65	15.89	
SBC10	9.34	33.29	
On the other hand, specimen SBC10 and
UV-A lamp, the
time needed to reach half of the final extent of the IFCT integrated
area is 9.34 min, versus 33.29 min when using the Vis-light (approximately
4 times faster). This means that a lamp irradiating with an energy
that is ≥TiO2Eg triggers
in a faster way the photochromic effect, through the PC mechanism.
However, this also means that the specimens show themselves to be
photochromic, even under visible-light exposure. This is explained
invoking a different phenomenon, that is, photosensitization of the
Cu(II)/TiO2 system. Indeed, as suggested by Irie et al.,
visible light triggers IFCT from the VB of titania to the Cu(II) that
are grafted onto the surface of TiO2 NPs.27 That is to say that the electrons in the VB of TiO2 are directly transferred to the CuO decorating the TiO2 NPs, reducing Cu2+ to Cu+, as spectroscopically
shown by the decrease in the Cu2+ d–d transitions
and the resultant increase in the extent of the IFCT band—and
visually by the change in color of the specimens, that is, photochromism.
A proposed mechanism of these two distinct phenomena is given in Figure 7a–c, where
the energy band diagrams of TiO2, whose surface is modified
with CuO and Ag2O, are given—the electrochemical
potentials of the band edges of TiO2, CuO, and Ag2O, with respect to the absolute vacuum scale, were taken from the
literature.33 [It has to be stressed that,
although the data in Figure 7a–c might not reflect a rigorous picture of the absolute
values of CB and VB potentials of the materials studied here, they
provide a reasonable estimate of the relative band edge positions.]
In both cases (UV-A and visible-light sources), TiO2 acts
itself as an electron shuttle.34

Figure 7 Proposed mechanism
for the UV-A and visible-light photochromism.
(a) After UV-A exposure, an electron is promoted from the VB to the
CB of TiO2, a CB transferring from TiO2 to CuO
is then favored, thus reducing Cu2+ to Cu+.
(b) Visible light triggers IFCT from the VB of titania directly to
the CB of Cu2+ that are grafted on the TiO2 surface,
reducing it and promoting the photochromic effect. The same proviso,
considering their band edge positions, can be made with TiO2 and Ag2O. (c) After UV-A and visible-light irradiation,
(most of) the Ag(I) and Cu(II) oxides have been reduced into Ag0 and Cu2O. This situation promotes charge separation,
as shown by the yellow arrow in the energy band diagram: electrons
move themselves from Ag0 to the CB of TiO2 and
from the CB of Cu2O to that of TiO2.

Photochromism is, per se, a reversible change in
color (and/or
optical absorption spectra) under electromagnetic radiation.35 Reversible photoswitches of specimens SBC1 and SBC2 were thus investigated. Specimens
were irradiated for 10 or 30 s with visible light (irradiance = 50
W m–2), then the reversibility of the process was
triggered by annealing the irradiated specimens in a dark oven at
100 °C for 15 min. As displayed in Figure 8a–d, SBC1 and SBC2 exhibit similar changes, both specimens show an increase in the
ΔRt value from
the un-irradiated state after the first exposure to visible light.
This is followed by a partial recovery of the initial virgin state
after annealing the samples in the dark at 100 °C for 15 min.
However, after that initial loss in the initial R % value, very close reflectance values are obtained from the 4th
switching cycle on, as a clear and repeatable gap is noticeable for
both specimens, exhibiting a high degree of stability and repeatability
in the switching values for repeated cycles (up to a total of 14),
as reported in Figure 8a,b. This initial instability seems to be originated from the swift
decrease from the virgin state: the time granted for the annealing
did not seem enough to fully reverse it.

2.3 Electrical
and Gas-Sensing Properties
The electrical behavior of the
prepared sensors was first investigated
by recording the resistance of the sensitive films directly printed
on the alumina substrates, in the temperature range of 100–400
°C in the presence of dry air. In order to favor the complete
desorption of humidity and other species likely adsorbed during environmental
exposure, each sensor was first allowed to stabilize at 400 °C,
and then, the resistance was recorded during a 50 °C step decrease
of the temperature. The plots of the resistance versus temperature
of pure TiO2 and Ag + Cu (Shibuichi)-modified
samples are reported in Figure 9. All samples show a decrease in the resistance with increase
in the temperature, according to typical semiconductor behavior in
the whole range of temperatures. Ti450 shows two linear
regions with different slopes, in the range 150–250 and 250–400
°C, respectively. This can be attributed to a strong adsorption
of oxygen species which, in turn, act increasing the electrical resistance.
As known, MOs are able to adsorb oxygen species as ions (•O2–, O–, O2–) on their surface as a function of the temperature.36 This implies that electrons are subtracted from the bulk,
increasing the electrical resistance. Furthermore, a different equilibrium
between adsorption and desorption of these species was established
as a function of the temperature. Therefore, if adsorption prevails
over desorption, a large quantity of oxygen is adsorbed on the MO
surface, which leads to a stronger removal of electrons from the bulk.
For an n-type semiconductor as TiO2, this
results in an increase of the resistance.37 According to this, it is plausible that Ti450 is able
to strongly adsorb oxygen in the temperature range of 150–250
°C showing two different slopes of the log resistance versus
temperature in the investigated range.

Figure 9 Electrical resistance
as a function of the temperature of the as-fabricated
gas sensors recorded in dry air.

On the contrary, as per Shibuichi samples
(SBC1, SBC2, SBC5, and SBC10), the trend of resistance fluctuation with the temperature
is linear
in the entire investigated range of temperatures, suggesting a lower
ability in adsorbing oxygen species. In addition, the effect of Ag
+ Cu modification is to decrease the electrical resistance in comparison
to Ti450 when the load is higher than 2 mol % as for SBC2, SBC5, and SBC10 samples. In
this regard, it was possible to record the resistance of these samples
up to 100 °C, while for Ti450 and SBC1 the resistance was much higher than the detection limit of the apparatus
employed.

The effect of Ag + Cu modification of TiO2 on the sensing
performance toward acetone was first investigated at different working
temperatures. Figure 10 shows the responses of the prepared sensors toward 20 ppm of acetone
as a function of the temperature, in the range 100–400 °C.
Owing to the high resistance of both Ti450 and SBC1, it was not possible to record the response at a temperature
lower than 150 °C. As observed, all sensors show a Gaussian-like
behavior, where a first rise of the responses up to 150–200
°C is followed by a decrease with further increase of the temperature.
These typical response behaviors can be simply explained, bearing
in mind the effect of different activation energies for the gas adsorption/desorption
and reaction processes occurring at the surface. At a low operating
temperature, the activation energy is not enough to promote the reaction
of acetone molecules with the active species present on the material
surface. This leads to a very weak or no alteration of the electrical
properties of the sensitive material and, consequently, to a weak
response.38 On the other hand, the adsorption
ability of acetone molecules onto the surface is reduced at higher
operating temperatures, thus leading again to a lower response.39

Figure 10 Gas responses toward 20 ppm acetone in dry air of Ti450- and Shibuichi-based sensors at different
operating
temperatures.

Among Shibuichi-based sensors, SBC2 is the one that shows the best
performances and have the maximum
response S = 9 at the lowest operating temperature,
150 °C. A further increase of Ag + Cu modification of TiO2 over 5 mol % as for the SBC10 sample resulted
in a strong decrease of the response to acetone. However, all Shibuichi-based sensors showed lower response in comparison
to Ti450, in the whole range of investigated temperatures.

However, response is not the sole parameter that is investigated
to define the performances of a gas sensor. In this regard, Figure 11 shows a comparison
of the transient responses recorded for each sensor at the operating
temperature of 200 °C to a pulse of 20 ppm acetone. Still in
a relatively low temperature, all Shibuichi-based
sensors show fast signal variations after acetone exposure, reaching
the equilibrium state in less than 30 s, which is faster than that
observed for Ti450-based sensor (Figure S8a). When the sensors are again exposed to pure air,
a fast recovery of the 90% of response is obtained in less than 30–40
s on the Shibuichi-based sensors. As per the Ti450-based sensor, it is worth noting that the time at 90%
of response recovery is close to that of the SBC2-based
sensor (Fig S8b); nevertheless, the time
to the full recovery of the baseline signal is much higher, thus leading
to a serious drawback in real applications. Therefore, a positive
effect of the incorporation of Ag + Cu into TiO2 is to
ease the desorption of subproducts of acetone reaction from the surface
of the material. In this regard, Dutta et al.,40 investigating the CO-sensing performance of anatase TiO2, suggested that CuO incorporation, favoring the decomposition
of carbonate intermediate species, aids the desorption of subproduced
CO2 and then the recovery time of the sensor. It is well
known that the typical sensing mechanism of reducing gases with MOs
involves the interaction of gas molecules with chemisorbed oxygen
species at the surface.41 At temperatures
lower than 200 °C, the predominant chemisorbed oxygen species
on MOs are O2– and O–. Therefore, because of the lower activation energy of these species
than the more reactive  species, a proposed sensing mechanism of
acetone might involve the quasi–chemical reactions, as given
by eqs 1 and 2(42) 1   2  

Figure 11 Transient responses toward 20 ppm acetone
in dry air of Ti450- and Shibuichi-based
sensors at the operating temperature
of 200 °C.

Accordingly, because
the reaction of acetone with surface-adsorbed
oxygen species may involve the formation of carbonates before the
evolution to CO2 and H2O, a similar catalytic
effect coming from CuO and/or AgO nanoclusters could be the reason
of faster recovery times of Shibuichi-TiO2 based sensors in comparison to Ti450.

All investigated
sensors show a reduction in the electrical resistance
when exposed to acetone, according to n-type semiconductor MOs when
they interact with reducing gases. This suggests that the addition
of such load of p-type species, like copper, is not enough to alter
the typical n-type behavior of anatase TiO2.43 Teleki et al.,44 showed
a p-type behavior in a heat-treated 100 wt % rutile TiO2 sensors toward CO at 500 °C, while the same authors observed
a n-type response for a 5 at. % Cu/TiO2-based sensor, having
a rutile content of 50 wt %.45 On the other
hand, Savage et al.46 investigated the
sensing behavior of mixed anatase–rutile TiO2 toward
CH4 and CO gases. They reported stable n-type response
for rutile phase less than 75 wt % and p-type response for pure rutile.
As all Shibuichi samples show contents of anatase
higher than 90 wt % and about 56 wt % for Ti450 (cf Table 1), this might explain
the stable n-type behavior of all the sensors reported here.

Among Ag–Cu samples, because of the higher response, lower
operating temperature, and reduced electrical resistance, the sensor
based on SBC2 was chosen to be investigated for further
sensing performances. Figure 12a shows the transient response recorded during subsequent
exposure of the SBC2-based sensor to different concentrations
of acetone ranging from 1 to 40 ppm in dry air at the working temperature
of 150 °C. The sensor shows a fast reduction of the electrical
resistance after acetone exposure. In addition, this sensor is able
to quickly and fully recover the baseline resistance after each pulse,
displaying a perfect reversible behavior. Figure 12b shows the calibration curve extrapolated
by the above transient responses. In the range of investigated concentration,
the response follows a typical log–log behavior, which can
be fitted by eq 3 3  

Figure 12 (a) Transient response of the SBC2-based sensor during
consecutive exposures ranging from 1 to 40 ppm of acetone in dry air
at the operating temperature of 150 °C; (b) calibration curve.

In eq 3, S is the response and c is the concentration of acetone.
The determination coefficient (R2 = 0.994)
suggests a good linear trend between the logarithm of response and
the logarithm of concentration, in the studied range. Using this data,
a limit of detection lower than 100 ppb of acetone can be estimated,
that is 5 times lower compared to the actual state-of-the-art TiO2-based sensors reported in the literature (i.e., 500 ppb).47

Aiming at exploring the reliability and
stability of the sensor,
the reproducibility of response was investigated by recording consecutive
pulses of acetone in the same and different days, respectively. Figure S9a displays the perfect repeatability
and reversibility of response when the sensor was exposed to five
consecutive pulses of 5 ppm of acetone in air. In addition, as observed
in Figure S9b, the response to 20 ppm acetone,
recorded during 3 different days after various cycles of heating–cooling
and exposure to different gases, is almost similar, also suggesting
excellent long-time reproducibility and stability of the sensing material.

The selectivity of the sensor was also investigated at the optimal
operating temperature for acetone, by analyzing the response toward
common organic and inorganic gases. The sensor shows low response
to typical concentration of the investigated gases (Figure 13a). Only the response to ethanol
at the same concentration of the acetone was very similar, suggesting
this sensor as a possible candidate for VOCs detection. Finally, in
practical applications, acetone coexists with humidity, whose typical
aftermath is to decrease the sensitivity of the sensor toward VOCs.
The effect of humid air was thus evaluated:48Figure 13b shows
a comparison of calibration curves recorded in dry and humid air (50%
RH at 25 °C) operating at the temperature of 150 °C. The
presence of humidity causes a decrease in response to acetone from
2- to 5-folds compared to that obtained in dry condition. Regardless
of that, the sensor was still able to show appreciable response to
a concentration of acetone as low as 500 ppb.

the SBC2-based sensor toward

3 Conclusions
Inspired by the Land of the Rising Sun, TiO2 NPs have
been decorated with one part of silver to three parts of copper—Shibuichi. This made a multifunctional nanomaterial, which
shows simultaneously photochromism and gas-sensing abilities. It has
been shown that photochromism might be triggered by UV-A and, most
strikingly, also visible light. However, two distinct phenomena are
responsible of the same effect. When using a UV-A lamp (i.e., an energy
≥ Eg), photocatalysis sensu
strictu happened to activate photochromism. On the other
hand, when employing a visible light, a photosensitization of Cu(II)/TiO2 system happens, triggering photochromism. Gas-sensing tests
showed that the modification of TiO2 NPs with Ag + Cu leads
to an improvement of the transient response to acetone, shortening
the response an recovery times in comparison to the pure TiO2-based sensor even working at a relatively low temperature of 150
°C. Furthermore, it also exhibited a lower detection limit for
acetone (5 times lower) compared to state-of-the-art TiO2-based sensors reported in the literature, for example, 100 ppb in
this work versus 500 ppb in previous work. Still, among the Shibuichi samples, a gas sensor based on TiO2 decorated with 2 mol % Ag + Cu showed excellent sensing performance
toward VOCs, exhibiting good sensitivity, stability, and selectivity
in comparison with other inorganic gases, as well as capability of
being implemented at lower operating temperature. All these characteristics
together make our material attractive for real commercial application.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Sample Preparation
An adapted aqueous
sol–gel method, developed by the authors, was used for the
synthesis of TiO2-based nanomaterials; precise detail of
it can be found elsewhere.49 To do the
Ag/Cu-modified TiO2, stoichiometric amounts of silver nitrate
(1 M aqueous solution, Sigma-Aldrich) and copper(II) nitrate trihydrate
(Aldrich, ≥98.5%) were added to the sol, which had a concentration
of 1 M Ti4+. The Ag/Cu molar ratio was strictly constrained
to be 1:3, to follow the Shibuichi formulation. Four
Ag/Cu-modified sols were prepared, with (Ag + Cu) molar amounts equal
to 1, 2, 5 and 10 mol % [i.e., in the case of (Ag + Cu) = 1 mol %,
Ag molar amount was 0.25 mol %, and Cu was 0.75 mol %, with Ag/Cu
= 0.25:0.75 = 1:3]. Afterward, dried gels were thermally treated at
450 °C under a static air flow, using an electric muffle furnace.
The heating/cooling rate was 5 °C min–1, with
a 2 h dwell time at the selected temperature. Samples were referred
to as Ti450 (unmodified TiO2), SBC1 (Ag + Cu = 1 mol %), SBC2 (Ag + Cu = 2 mol %), SBC5 (Ag + Cu = 5 mol %), and SBC10 (Ag + Cu
= 10 mol %).

4.2 Sample Characterization
Information
about the microstructure of the specimens was attained via advanced
X-ray methods. The Rietveld method was used to obtain semiquantitative
information about the phase composition of the samples (i.e., not
accounting for the presence of amorphous fraction). XRD patterns for
QPAs were recorded on a θ/θ diffractometer (PANalytical
X’Pert Pro, NL), equipped with a fast RTMS detector (PIXcel
1D, PANalytical), with Cu Kα radiation (45 kV and 40 mA, 20–80°
2θ range, with a virtual step scan of 0.02° 2θ and
a virtual time per step of 200 s). Rietveld refinements were accomplished
by means of GSAS-EXPGUI software suite,50,51 following
the refining strategy that we reported previously;31 structure models of anatase, rutile, and brookite were
taken from the literature.52−54 WPPM formalism,55 through the PM2K software package,56 was used to extract microstructural information from the XRD data.
In this latter case, aiming to manipulate data with a high signal-to-noise
ratio, XRD patterns were recorded in the same instrument and setup
as described above, but in the 20–145° 2θ range,
with a virtual step of 0.1° 2θ, and virtual time per step
of 500 s. The instrumental contribution was obtained by parameterizing
the profile of 14 hkl reflections from the NIST SRM
660b standard (LaB6), according to the Caglioti et al.
relationship.57 The following parameters
were refined: background (modeled with a sixth-order Chebyshev polynomial),
peak intensities, specimen displacement, lattice parameters, and mean
and variance of the size distributions. Crystalline domains were approximated
to be spherical with their diameter distributed according to a lognormal
curve.

HR-STEM experiments were performed using an FEI Titan
low-base microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with an EDS detector,
a CESCOR Cs probe corrector, an ultrabright X-FEG electron source,
and a monochromator. HR-STEM imaging was performed using HAADF and
ADF detectors. The inner and outer angles for most of the micrographs
recorded with the HAADF and ADF detector were 48 and 200 mrad and
22 and 120 mrad, respectively. Automatic indexation of the FFT patterns
was performed by using the JEMS software.58 For TEM studies, samples were dispersed in ethanol in an ultrasound
bath for a few minutes and a drop of the suspension was placed onto
a molybdenum/nickel grids coated with carbon membrane.

Optical
properties of the specimens were investigated by means
of DRS on a Shimadzu UV-3100 spectrometer (JP), equipped with an integrating
sphere, and a white reference material made of Spectralon; the UV–Vis
spectral range (250–850 nm) was investigated, with 0.2 nm in
resolution. To explore the photochromic properties of the specimens,
they were exposed (0.1 g), for different irradiation times, to either
UV-A or visible light. A protocol described in more detail in our
previous works10,11,31 was severely followed to get comparable data. The UV-A and visible-light
lamps were placed above (vertically) the specimen, adjusting the distance
between the lamp and the specimen to get the desired irradiance values.
The intensity of the radiation reaching the samples, measured with
a radiometer (Delta OHM, HD2302.0, IT), was estimated to be ∼22
W m–2 in the UVA range (315 nm < λ <
400 nm) and ∼50 W m–2 in the visible region
(λ > 400 nm, being nil in the UVA); irradiation times were
considered
to be consecutive and absolute. Reflectance data were transformed
into pseudo-absorption spectra F(R) by means of the Kubelka–Munk transformation:59F(R) = α
= (1 – R)2/2R,
where R is the reflectance. To explore the reversibility
of the photochromic process, fresh un-irradiated samples were exposed
to visible light (as above) for periods ranging from 10 to 30 s, at
room temperature, and their DRS spectra were recorded immediately.
They were then placed in a dark oven at 100 °C for 15 min to
reverse the process, and the optical spectra were measured again.
The degree of photoswitching has been described as the difference
between the maximum value in reflectance at time zero (R0) and the reflectance after each irradiation/annealing
cycle (Rt): ΔRt (%) = (R0 – Rt)/R0 × 100. Raman spectra were measured
using a RFS 100/S (Bruker, DE) equipped with a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser
as the excitation source, in the 50–1000 cm–1 wavenumber range, with 2 cm–1 resolution.

4.3 Gas Sensing
Gas-sensing performance
of the synthesized materials was investigated by fabricating resistive
gas sensor devices. The screen printing method has been used to make
reproducible thick films (3 × 3 mm2 area, and ∼10
μm in thickness). The synthesized nanopowders were mixed with
an appropriate volume of double distilled water to obtain a paste.
Appropriate water amounts have been added to have an ink paste with
suitable rheological properties. Then, the ink has been deposited
by means of a hand screen printer over the interdigitated area of
the sensor. This latter was made of an alumina substrates (6 ×
3 mm2 × 0.5 mm), supplied by a pair of Pt interdigitated
electrodes on one side and a Pt heater on the other side. The film
has been printed with the appropriate geometric characteristic by
using a proper plastic mask.

Sensing measurements were carried
out in the range of temperature 100–400 °C under a controlled
atmosphere, by placing the sensors in an optimized stainless steel
test chamber where a constant gas steam of 100 scc/min was allowed
to flow. All gases and acetone vapor (coming from certified bottles)
can be progressively diluted in air using mass flow controllers, in
order to obtain the desired working concentrations. Electrical resistance
of the sensitive films was recorded by a Keithley 6487 picoammeter/voltage
source, while an Agilent 3632A was employed to power the heater of
the sensor substrate in order to control the operating temperature.
The gas sensor response, S, is defined as the ratio Rair/Rg, where Rair is the electrical resistance of the sensor
in reference air (baseline resistance) and Rg is the electrical resistance at the fixed target gas concentration.
The response and recovery times, unless otherwise indicated, were
calculated at 90% of response variation.
