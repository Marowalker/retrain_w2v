The cosmetic industry provides a
wide variety of shampoos to treat dandruff, containing insoluble ingredients
such as Zn pyrithione. However, the solubility of this active ingredient
is quite limited in both water and oil media; thus, antidandruff formulations
must include a large amount of chemically synthesized stabilizing
ingredients to avoid their precipitation. In this work, the stabilization
of Zn pyrithione in O/W emulsions using a biosurfactant (BS) extract and Tween 80 is studied. The study includes an incomplete
factorial design based on the tea tree oil/water ratio and both surfactant
and biosurfactant concentrations. The formulations are characterized
in terms of particle size, stability after 30 days, and solubility
of Zn pyrithione. The formulation that provided the most favorable
results contains Tween 80 (5%) and BS extract (2.5%), with an O/W
ratio of 0.01. This provides the smallest particle size (40.5 μm),
good stability after 30 days (91.0%), and the highest solubility of
Zn pyrithione (59%). The results obtained enable the use of the combination
of BS extract and Tween 80 as bio/surfactants of antidandruff shampoo
formulations, along with another antiseptic agent such as tea tree
oil. Furthermore, this is the first work where a biosurfactant is
considered to be a stabilizing agent in antidandruff formulations.

==== Body
Introduction
Dandruff is a generally
known scalp disorder, also defined as the mildest version of seborrheic
dermatitis.1 It is characterized by the
formation of small flakes and sebum that occur in localized areas
on the scalp, such as the forehead and the back of the ears beyond
the hairline.2 Other symptoms derived from
dandruff may be the feeling of a tight or dry scalp, producing irritation
and itching.3 Therefore, it is stated as
an abnormal condition that affects more than 50% of adults. What is
more, its manifestation provokes a high socioeconomical impact, leading
to the loss of self-esteem for the population that suffers from it.4

Nowadays, there are a wide variety of marketed
products to treat this problem. The most frequently used antidandruff
treatment is the regular use of shampoos and conditioners that remove
loosely attached flakes from the scalp. As a matter of fact, a successful
antidandruff shampoo not only has to prove efficacy against dandruff
removal to ensure patient compliance but also needs to offer excellent
cosmetic and hair conditioning benefits, such as ease of combing,
smoothness, softness, breakage reduction, and hair manageability.1 Recent developments in shampoo technology have
already led to an increase in the efficacy of antidandruff agents,
allowing shorter contact time and reducing irritation.5

Those antidandruff shampoos contain agents that primarily
exhibit an antimicrobial action against the growth of Malassezia species, the organisms responsible for dandruff. Among those agents,
molecules such as azoles or hydroxypyridones and agents such as piroctone
olamine, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, ketoconazole, and zinc
pyrithione can be found.2,6,7 Among these compounds, there is no big difference in efficacy.8,9 However, Zn pyrithione is preferred in terms of the overall performance,
improving the appearance and feel of the hair.10 In this regard, Zn pyrithione has been established as an
effective antiseborrheic agent. It is currently marketed in shampoos
and hair dressings at concentration levels of about 0.5 and 2.0%,
respectively.6 It has been successfully
included in shampoos due to its strong antibacterial effect and ability
to slow down the rapid turnover of epidermal cells, proving its efficacy
in many studies and clinical trials.10,11 Moreover,
this highly active compound has been listed in the Food and Drug Administration
Final Monograph on Dandruff and Seborrheic Dermatitis as a Category
I substance, meaning it is generally recognized as a safe and effective
drug.12

However, this active ingredient
is present in the form of dispersed fine solid particles since its
solubility is quite limited in both water and oil media.13 Along this line, it has been stated that its
solubility in water is about 6–20 ppm at pH 7 and increases
to 35–50 ppm at pH 8.7,14

On the other
hand, there are other active agents available for use in antidandruff
formulations such as tea tree oil. This oil extract has been demonstrated
to be an excellent antiseptic, containing terpenes that penetrate
the deeper layers of the scalp, developing more efficiently its disinfectant
activity than other emollients.15

Conversely, the stability of antidandruff formulations depends on
the use of chemically synthesized surfactants. As a matter of fact,
anionic surfactants have been used to solubilize Zn pyrithione formulations
to stabilize these formulations. However, the presence of an anionic
surfactant was proved to be insufficient to achieve dispersion stability.13 Moreover, it is noticeable that the surfactant
concentrations used in these kinds of formulations are really high,
around 30% in some cases,16,17 which can have harmful
effects on the skin.18 Therefore, one possibility
would be substituting these synthetic surfactants with their homologous
biosurfactants, which present the same characteristics but better
biocompatibility and lower toxicity than their chemical counterparts.19

Conversely, an amphoteric biosurfactant
(BS) extract has been obtained from corn stream residues. This BS
extract is mainly composed of antioxidants, fatty acids, and lipopeptide
biosurfactants,20,21 presenting an rHLB of 12 and
good wetting activity in O/W formulations.22 It has been demonstrated to solubilize mica particles due to the
adsorption onto the surface of the material, providing it with hydrophobicity,
being able to form a stable emulsion.23 On the other hand, this BS extract has already been tested in damaged
and undamaged hair, observing an improvement in the cuticle, with
more homogeneous borders and thicker hair than untreated dyed hair.21,24

The aim of the study is to obtain more natural and biocompatible
formulations through the use of natural surfactants like that obtained
from corn stream. It is expected that the biosurfactant under evaluation
improves the stability and solubilization of Zn pyrithione in aqueous
formulations in the presence of tea tree oil and with Tween 80 as
a surfactant, which is widely used in shampoo formulations. For this
purpose, a Box–Behnken factorial design was established
with different formulations, using the concentration of Tween 80 and
BS extract (%), together with the tea tree oil/water ratio, as independent
variables of the study. Consequently, there were evaluated the particle
size distribution of emulsions, the stability of formulations after
30 days of emulsion formation and the solubility of Zn pyrithione.

Experimental
Section
Reagents
Zn pyrithione powder was provided by Guinama
S.L.U. (Lot 0081880, Spain), tea tree oil was provided by Gran Velada
(Zaragoza, Spain), and Tween 80, synthesis grade, was provided by
Scharlau S.L. (Spain).

Biosurfactant Extract from Corn Stream
Extraction
Procedure
The biosurfactant (BS) extract was obtained from
corn steep liquor (CSL) stream provided by Feed Stimulants (Netherlands).
The CSL was diluted in water and extracted with an organic solvent
using the protocol established by Vecino et al.25 The organic solvent was then subjected to vacuum evaporation
and the oily biosurfactant extract was kept at −20 °C
until its use.

General Physicochemical Characterization
of the BS Extract
To corroborate that the biosurfactant extract
obtained in this work possesses the same characteristics as those
reported in previous works, this extract was subjected to several
analyses, and the results were compared with some of the properties
included in Table 1. Table 1 includes
the properties of the biosurfactant extract under evaluation documented
in previous works.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The
biosurfactant under evaluation was characterized via identification
of the functional groups and chemical bonds present in the biosurfactant
extract. For this purpose, 1 mg of the BS extract was ground with
10 mg of potassium bromide and pressed (7500 kg for 30 s) to produce
translucent pellets.

FTIR analyses were carried out on a Niocolet
6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The spectral measurements
were made in absorbance mode in the range of 400–4000 cm–1, with a resolution of 4 cm–1, an
average range of 32 data scanning, and a potassium bromide pellet
for measuring background absorbance levels.

Surface
Tension and Critical Micellar Concentration (CMC)
The surface
tension and critical micelle concentration (CMC) were determined for
the biosurfactant extract. The CMC is the minimum surfactant concentration
needed to produce the maximum reduction in the surface tension of
water. Above the CMC, the surface tension of a biosurfactant solution
is constant and specific for each biosurfactant. Below the CMC, a
linear relationship can be established between the surface tension
and the concentration of a specific surfactant in an aqueous solution.
Thus, for establishing this relationship, different solutions containing
different concentrations of this biosurfactant were prepared and their
surface tension was measured using a Kruss tensiometer (K20 EasyDyne),
choosing the Wilhelmy plate method at room temperature (21 ±
1°). Measurements were made in triplicate to increase the accuracy
of the results.

Elemental Analysis
The sample was
decomposed by combustion and was then analyzed using chromatographic
analysis with thermal conductivity detection. C, N, H, and S were
determined using a Fisons Carlo Erba EA-1108 CHNS-O elemental analyzer.
Hence, the amount of N can be correlated with the protein content
by multiplying it by a factor of 6.25.30

Preparation of Zn Pyrithione Emulsions
Different formulations
were prepared based on a Box–Behnken factorial design to study
the solubility and stabilization of Zn pyrithione in aqueous solutions.
The emulsions were composed of two different surfactants (Tween 80
and BS extract), Zn pyrithione as the active compound, tea tree essential
oil as the oil phase, and demineralized water. For the Box–Behnken
experimental design, three different independent variables were established: X1 (Tween 80 concentration, %), X2 (BS concentration, %), and X3 (oil/water ratio). The amount of the different components was constrained
as follows: Tween 80 concentration (0–5%, w/w), biosurfactant
extract concentration (0–5%, w/w), and the oil/water ratio
(0.01–0.1, w/w). The concentration of Zn pyrithione was kept
at 0.5% (w/w) for all emulsions, a typical concentration in antidandruff
shampoos. In this regard, different formulations were established.

During the experimental design, the values of the independent variables
were coded, obtaining the standardized (coded) dimensionless independent
variables used with limits of variation (−1, 1). This was applied
so that the independent variables selected in the study were not influenced
by their magnitudes; thus, they were normalized and a relationship
between coded and uncoded variables was established using linear equations.
Coded variables were then assigned values of −1, 0, and +1,
corresponding to the lowest, central, and maximum limits of variation
for each one.

Formulations were prepared by adding the different
components in the stated concentrations up to 8 g at room temperature
(22 ± 1 °C). Then, all components were mixed within 2 min
with an Ultraturrax IKA T25 (Germany) at 20.000 rpm, to guarantee
the complete formation of the emulsions.

Emulsion Characterization
Size
Measurement and Emulsion Stability
The particle size distribution
of the emulsions (mean diameter) was evaluated by light scattering
using a LS 13 320 particle size analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Spain),
which accounts from 40 nm up to 2000 μm. Individual formulations
were prepared and evaluated at different times (at the first day,
after 15 days, and after 30 days of experiment). A volume of 1.5 mL
of each formulation was directly poured into the analyzer tubes. No
dilutions were necessary.

Conversely, the emulsion stability
of each formulation was measured taking into account the particle
size distribution at the first day of production (size 1 day) and after 30 days of experiment (size 30 days),
as follows 1  

Zn Pyrithione
Solubility
Zn pyrithione solubility was determined after
30 days by analyzing the Zn content of the sample by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). An Optima 4300DV ICP-OES
(PerkinElmer, Spain) equipped with a OneNeb nebulizer, baffled cyclonic
spray chamber, and optics with an Echelle polychromator system was
used. First, 1 mL of each formulation was calcined in an oven at 500
°C for 3 h. Afterward, the sample was mixed with a solution of
nitric acid (2%), diluting the resultant products of the reaction
in demineralized water up to 10 mL.

The conditions used for
running the experiments were as follows: auxiliary gas flow (0.2 L/min),
nebulizer gas flow (0.6 L/min), plasma gas flow (15 L/min), and radio
frequency generator power (1300 W). The instrument was calibrated
with a solution of nitric acid at 2%. Zn was detected at 206.2 nm.

Once the Zn concentration (mg/L) contained in each sample is determined,
the solubility of Zn pyrithione can be calculated, taking into account
that Zn pyrithione presents 20.7% of elemental Zn. Therefore, the
solubility (%) of each sample, has been calculated as follows 2  Apart from this, the solubility
improvement ratio was studied to compare the solubility obtained in
these formulations (solubility t) with the medium solubility
of Zn pyrithione in water (20 mg/L), as follows 3  

Macroscopic and Microscopic Analysis
The macroscopic
views of the emulsions were obtained with a Samsung dual pixel 12.0
MP (F/1.7) mobile camera using an optical zoom (4×).

For
microscopic characterization of the different emulsion droplets, a
Nikon Eclipse E800 optical microscope equipped with a Nikon camera
was used. The emulsion was placed on the microscope stage and observed
through a 4× objective lens. The ocular was changed until different
magnifications were obtained for the samples, ranging from 4×
till 20×. The photographs were taken using NIS Elements D2.30
SPI software (Nikon).

Statistical Analysis
The experimental data were analyzed by the response surface method
with Statistica 7.0 software, by adjusting the obtained dependent
experimental data to a quadratic function shown in eq 4 4  where Y is the dependent variable, β denotes
the regression coefficients (calculated from experimental data by
multiple regressions using the least-squares method), and X denotes the fixed independent variables, corresponding
to X1 (Tween 80 concentration, %), X2 (BS concentration, %), and X3 (oil/water ratio).

The particle size of the formulations
(Y1), the stability after 30 days of experiment
(Y2), and the solubility of Zn pyrithione
(Y3) were chosen as dependent variables.
All theoretical values for these variables can be predicted by eq 4 in the range of the independent
variables included in the study.

Results and Discussion
Biosurfactant
Characterization and Properties
The BS extract under evaluation
has been characterized using infrared radiation, to elucidate the
molecular components of the biosurfactant extracted. Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectrum of
the biosurfactant extract from corn stream under evaluation. The spectral
analysis of the biosurfactant indicates the presence of protein-related
weak bands: C=O bond at 1750–1650 cm–1 (amide bonds) and N–H bonds at 1587 cm–1 (amide and amine bonds). The absorbance band between 3010 and 2850
cm–1 and bands at around 1467–1365 cm–1 denote the presence of C–H stretching corresponding
to the CH2 and CH3 groups of aliphatic chains.
The bands at 1743–1708 cm–1 are stretching
vibrations of C–O and C=O bonds in carboxyl esters.

of the biosurfactant extract from corn stream.

Furthermore, the bands at 1164 and 1240 cm–1 indicate
the presence of a fatty acid. This spectrum is similar to those obtained
in previous studies,26 showing the reproducibility
of the extraction process.

As a result, the FTIR spectrum of
the biosurfactant confirmed that this extract contains lipids and
peptides, corroborating the lipopeptide nature of the biosurfactant
extract (see Figure 1). Moreover, the elemental analysis revealed that this biosurfactant
extract was composed of 72% C, 11.5% H, and 1.7% N, similarly to the
elemental composition reported in previous works,21 included in Table 1.

Regarding other properties, it is important to remark that the BS extract evaluated
in this work was able to reduce the surface tension of water up to
40 mN/m, possessing a CMC of 140 mg/L, above which micelles would
be formed.27

Experimental Design: Zn
Pyrithione Emulsions
Different emulsions containing a BS
extract, Tween 80, and tea tree oil were obtained to study the solubility
and stability of a common antidandruff agent, Zn pyrithione, in aqueous
solutions. Moreover, the particle size and stability (after 30 days)
were studied for all emulsions. The formulations were prepared according
to the Box–Behnken experimental design (Table 2).

As mentioned above,
the independent variables established in the assay were the Tween
80 concentration (X1), the BS concentration
(X2), and the tea tree oil/water ratio
(X3). Conversely, the dependent variables
studied were the particle size of each emulsion (Y1), the stability of the emulsion after 30 days (Y2), and the solubility of Zn pyrithione (Y3). All experimental results obtained for these
dependent variables are summarized in Table 2.

According to Table 2, the lowest values of the different variables
will be coded as −1 (0% for Tween 80 concentration, 0% for
BS concentration, and 0.01 for the oil/water ratio) the intermediate
as 0 (2.5% for Tween 80 concentration, 2.5% for BS concentration,
and 0.055 for the oil/water ratio) and the highest as 1 (5.0% for
Tween 80 concentration, 5.0% for BS concentration, and 0.1 for oil/water
ratio).

Regarding the particle size (Y1), it is observed in Table 2 that the values ranged from 14.8 to 93.7 μm
for the different formulations. In general, emulsions with a smaller
particle size are preferred because they are usually more stable and
penetrate better into the deepest layers of hair.31,32 However, in this case, the emulsion particle size is restricted
by the particle size of Zn pyrithione powder, as it contains particles
of 20 μm diameter. As a consequence, emulsion particle sizes
are above this value. As a matter of fact, it is noted that the formulation
with the lowest particle size (14.8 μm) corresponds to the control
sample (formulation number 1) as it does not contain any bio/surfactant
on the formulation and, consequently, almost no Zn pyrithione in suspension.
The rest of the emulsion particle sizes are found to be in the range
from 33.9 to 93.7 μm.

Another point to take into consideration
is that the smallest sizes, in the presence of Zn pyrithione, correspond
to the formulations containing the biosurfactant extract from corn
stream, as can be observed in formulation numbers 6, 7, and 12, which
possess a particle size of 40.5, 33.9, and 47.0 μm, respectively.

In regard to the stability of the emulsions (Y2), the values shown in Table 2 were calculated according to eq 1, which takes into account the particle
size distribution (mean diameter) of the emulsion at the first day
of preparation and after 30 days. In this respect, if the mean diameter
is constant through the experimental time, it means that the formulation
remains stable, as particles do not agglomerate, keeping the colloidal
system unchanged. In this sense, it can be observed that, except for
formulation number 1, all stability values are above 50%, showing
good stability of all emulsions. Moreover, it is necessary to remark
that higher stability values were achieved for formulation numbers
3 (90.0%), 6 (91.0%), and 8 (93.2%). Once again, all of these formulations
have in common the presence of the BS extract from corn stream, as
can be observed in Table 2. These results are in concordance with a previous study,
where the BS extract under evaluation was used to stabilize Pickering
emulsions containing mica and vitamin E, observing a synergistic effect
between mica and the BS extract, obtaining stability values around
80% after 30 days of emulsion formation.23

Additionally, the solubility of Zn pyrithione in the different
formulations (Y3) is determined after
analyzing the Zn content on each sample, following eq 2. The values are quite different
for the formulations, with the percentage of solubility ranging from
1.2 to 59.0%. In fact, formulations with the worse solubility (1.2,
1.7, and 1.4%) have in common the absence of the BS extract, as can
be observed in Table 2 (formulation numbers 1, 2, and 9, respectively). Therefore, it can
be observed that the presence of Tween 80, even at the highest concentration
(formulation number 2), gave a poor solubility of Zn pyrithione similar
to the control (formulation number 1). Meanwhile, the capacity of
the BS extract alone to solubilize Zn pyrithione is higher than that
of Tween 80 alone, at the same O/W ratio (see formulation number 3).

Additionally, it is noted when formulation numbers 6 and 8 are
compared that both possess the same ingredients but different O/W
ratios, and the solubility of Zn pyrithione is improved (from 11.6
to 59.0) when higher O/W ratios are used.

Conversely, the best
values (59.0 and 33.6%) were obtained for those formulations containing
2.5% of BS extract in their formulations (formulation numbers 6 and
7, respectively). It is interesting to remark that using the BS extract alone as the stabilizing agent and in
the presence of the highest O/W ratio assayed (formulation number
7) the second highest experimental value for the solubility of Zn
pyrithione (33.6%) was achieved.

However, the synergistic effect
of both surfactant and biosurfactant improves the solubility of Zn
pyrithione, increasing the solubility in all cases, being this effect
more noticeable at lower O/W ratios (see formulation numbers 5 and
6). The above-mentioned behavior confirms the capability of the BS
extract under evaluation to stabilize emulsions containing minerals
with poor solubility in water. Rincón-Fontán et al.28 observed that the BS extract under evaluation
was able to solubilize an inert material (mica) by being adsorbed
onto the surface of mica powder, keeping it in solution. If this behavior
is applied to the current formulations, it can be speculated that
the BS extract can be adsorbed onto the surface of Zn pyrithione powder
acquiring hydrophobic properties, which indicates that it is stable
at the oil–water interface, obtaining a better emulsion. Moreover,
as the biosurfactant extract presents an amphoteric character,29 it can provide partial charges to this powder
improving its stabilization. These charges would allow interactions
with the dispersed medium of the emulsion, making Zn pyrithione soluble.

It is known that the maximum soluble concentration of Zn pyrithione
in water is stated to be around 6–20 mg/L.7 In this respect, Table 3 shows the soluble concentration in mg/L obtained for
each sample, which are in all cases above 20 mg/L, and the solubility
improvement ratio, obtained from eq 3.

Table 3 Soluble Zn Pyrithione Concentration
(mg/L) and Solubility Improvement Ratio Regarding Water for Each Formulation

Therefore, in formulation
number 6, a solubility of 2948 mg/L was achieved, improving the Zn
pyrithione solubility 147 times. This emulsion is also characterized
by higher stability (91.0%) and a smaller particle size (40.5 μm)
in comparison with the rest of the formulations. Regarding its composition,
it contains 7.5% of surfactant (5.0% of Tween 80 and 2.5% of BS extract)
and a small content of oil (1%).

It must be mentioned that the
studies related to the solubility of Zn pyrithione are quite scarce.
In this way, different patents have been found in the literature,
where Zn pyrithione is solubilized through the addition of different
synthetic compounds. As an example, US Patent 3940482 conveys the
possibility of solubilizing Zn pyrithione, thanks to the use of aliphatic
polyamines or quaternary ammonium compounds,14 forming a complex with Zn pyrithione in water, obtaining values
of 100 mg/L of soluble Zn pyrithione, which is well below the maximum
value achieved in this assay (2948 mg/L). The problem that arises
from this concept is that it is just stable at pH above 9.0, which
can lead to a destabilization of Zn pyrithione (above pH 8.0).33 In this sense, another study (US3636213A) presents
a method to solubilize heavy metal salts of 1-hydroxy-2-pyridinethione
by mixing the salts with an amine, and neutralizing the resultant
alkaline solutions with mineral acids or simple carboxylic acids to
form compositions of a pH acceptable for more general application
to the skin and hair.34 The solubility
of the zinc salt in formulations having a pH of about 8 was proved
to be around 200 mg/L. However, the most useful cosmetic and dermatologic
compositions have a lower pH, as the pH of the scalp is stated to
be 5.5, whereas for the hair shaft, it is about 3.7.6 Therefore, it is necessary to prepare shampoo formulations
with a pH from 5 to 8. For instance, the use of suitable amines for
solubilizing the metal pyrithiones, such as ethanolamine, diethanolamine,
or diglycolamine (among others), has been proven.13

Other studies showed the possibility of producing
Zn pyrithione in situ by the reaction of sodium pyrithione and zinc
chloride, obtaining a maximum solubility of 1000 mg/L.35 Again, this assay has proven the possibility
of solubilizing Zn pyrithione to a larger extent than in the mentioned
studies, using more natural and biocompatible ingredients than synthetic
amines or anionic surfactants.

Another example in which sodium
pyrithione has been used shows the possibility of adding as well some
organic amines to enhance solubility.36 Accordingly, the sodium salt of pyrithione is highly soluble in
water and present fungicidal and bactericidal properties. However,
it has been found to be toxic and unacceptable for use in cosmetics
or dermatological compositions for topical application to the skin.7

Contrarily, the different experiments performed
in this study have shown promising results without the need to add
organic compounds, to include Zn pyrithione in hair care formulations.
All mentioned methods use different amines or acids to enhance the
solubility of Zn pyrithione, resulting in a tough procedure where
the different components must be mixed. However, using the BS extract
under evaluation achieves solubility values of Zn pyrithione similar
to or above those obtained in those studies, providing new formulations
composed of greener compounds.

Emulsion Characterization
All formulations have been characterized by light microscopy and
macroscopic analysis. Figure 2 shows the macroscopic images of the different formulations.

Figure 2 Macroscopic
images of the different formulations of the Box–Behnken study.

In this regard, it can be observed that the emulsions
with an orange color contain the BS extract, as it is yellowish. It
was observed that the emulsions just containing the BS extract, without
Tween 80 (formulation numbers 3, 5, and 7) present less stable emulsions;
however, emulsions containing Tween 80 and the BS extract as a cosurfactant
showed good stability (formulation numbers 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, and 14),
which is in agreement with the data reported in a previous work, where
it was observed that the biosurfactant under evaluation improves the
capacity to stabilize O/W emulsions when it acts as a cosurfactant.22 Moreover, the capacity of the BS extract to
form stable nanoemulsions has been demonstrated.22

Conversely, Figure 3A,B shows the microscopic analysis of some formulations
with a favorable size and emulsion stability, as well as good solubility
for Zn pyrithione (formulation numbers 6 and 8).

Figure 3 Microscopic images at
40× of the emulsions from (A) formulation number 6 (5% Tween
80, 2.5% BS, and 0.01 tea tree oil/water ratio) and (B) formulation
number 8 (5% Tween 80, 2.5% BS, and 0.1 tea tree oil/water ratio).

It is noticeable that the behavior observed in Figure 3A,B is quite similar,
as both emulsions present small and quite homogeneous droplets, where
the particles remain dispersed. However, it can be observed in Table 2 that the amount of
Zn pyrithione solubilized was higher in formulation number 6 (59.0%),
against formulation number 8 (11.6%). The main difference between
them lies in the oil/water ratio, observing an improvement in Zn solubility
when the oil content is lower in the formulation, which is not really
appreciated in the emulsion microscopic images.

Statistical
Analysis
The experimental results were subjected to a statistical
analysis (Statistica 7.0 software) to obtain different theoretical
equations that can predict the behavior of the dependent variables
under study (Y1, Y2, and Y3). In this regard, Table 4 shows the different
coefficients and their significance obtained for the statistical analysis
of this Box–Behnken experimental design. Three different equations
were obtained for each dependent variable, using the significant coefficients
obtained in Table 4, as follows 5   6   7  According to the p-values obtained, concentrations of
Tween 80 (X1) and the BS extract (X2) were the most significant variables for particle
size (Y1) and stability of emulsions (Y2), whereas the O/W ratio (X3) was the least influential variable (Table 4). However, regarding the solubility
of Zn pyrithione (Y3), the O/W ratio (X3) possesses a similar significance to Tween
80 (X1) and the BS extract (X2). This information can be corroborated in Figure S1 (see the Supporting Information), which
shows the Pareto chart of effects for the different variables (Y1, Y2, and Y3).

Furthermore, the statistical analysis
provides information of the correlation established between the experimental
and theoretical values, which are really well adjusted, with a correlation
value (R2) of 0.81 for Y1, 0.77 for Y2, and 0.94 for Y3 (see Figure S2 in
the Supporting Information).

On the other hand, Figure 4 shows different graphics obtained
using the oil/water ratio (X3) as a fixed
variable at its minimum (0.01) and maximum (0.1) values. Figure 4A,B represents the
variation of the particle size at low and high oil/water ratios, respectively.
In this regard, it can be observed that at lower O/W ratios (Figure 4A) the presence of
the BS extract (X2) increases the particle
size of emulsions, whereas at higher O/W ratios (Figure 4B), the concentration of Tween
80 (X1) is the variable that increases
the particle size of emulsions to a large extent. Therefore, at lower
O/W ratios (Figure 4A), higher concentrations of Tween 80 and lower to intermediate concentrations
of the BS extract can be used to obtain a smaller particle size, whereas
at higher O/W ratios (Figure 4B), the BS extract can be added in higher concentrations than
Tween 80.

Figure 4 Three-dimensional (3D) surface graphics obtained for the fixed
variable of oil/water ratio (X3) at 0.01
and 0.1, respectively: (A) and (B) for the particle size (Y1); (C) and (D) for the stability after 30 days
(Y2), and (E) and (F) for the solubility
of Zn pyrithione (Y3).

Regarding the stability after 30 days, Figure 4C,D presents its variation as a function
of BS (X2) and Tween 80 (X1) concentration at lower and higher O/W ratios, respectively.
In general, it can be observed that the increase in Tween 80 and BS
concentrations better stabilizes the emulsions in all cases, regardless
of the O/W ratio.

Finally, 3D graphics were obtained for the
solubility of Zn pyrithione (Figure 4E,F). Figure 4E shows the variation of the solubility at low O/W ratios,
observing values of maximum solubility of Zn pyrithione at high concentrations
of Tween 80, in the presence of intermediate to high concentrations
of the BS extract. Nonetheless, in the case of emulsions containing
higher O/W ratios (Figure 4F), best results were obtained in presence of the BS extract
but with a reduced concentration of Tween 80. All of these results
corroborate the significant effect of the O/W ratio on the Zn pyrithione
solubility.

Summary and Conclusions
In conclusion,
a BS extract from corn stream was demonstrated to produce formulations
with small particle size, higher stability, and, overall, good solubility
of Zn pyrithione. In fact, the BS extract was able to enhance the
solubility of Zn pyrithione in aqueous formulations, up to 147 times
in comparison with its solubility in water, with the optimum formulation
of Tween 80 (5%) and BS extract (2.5%) and an O/W ratio of 0.01.

Moreover, some of the different oil-in-water formulations of the
study have been proven to be quite stable even after 30 days, up to
values of 93.2%.

Conversely, this work supposes an advance in
terms of biocompatibility, as the current ingredients used in the
industry for stabilizing Zn pyrithione are from synthetic origin.

In fact, the biosurfactant under evaluation allowed achieving solubility
values of Zn pyrithione similar to or above the ones obtained in those
studies carried out with persistent organic surfactants. Thus, the
inclusion of the biosurfactant extract and Tween 80 in antidandruff
shampoo formulations, along with another antiseptic agent such as
tea tree oil, could be presented as an interesting option.
