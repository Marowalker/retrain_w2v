A facile route to 3-sulfonylated
and 3-(1-benzotriazolyl)-benzofurans
is achieved from readily available o-hydroxyphenyl
propargyl alcohols (o-HPPAs) and bench-top sodium
sulfonylates and benzotriazoles with no assistance of any reagent
or catalyst. Bifunctional o-quinone methides (o-QMs) were the putative reaction intermediates ensued from
dehydration of o-HPPA. Our study revealed that the o-QM was so choosy in selection of the nucleophiles for
the key Michael addition reaction.

Introduction
Electrophilic cyclizations1 of functionalized
alkynes often offer an opportunity for tandem reactions through post
cyclization couplings and additions toward complex outcomes in short
routes.1 Reverse to this strategy, some
precyclization events such as couplings or additions are done in such
a way that the resultant adducts readily cyclize in the same conditions
to furnish again the complex but usually the complimentary structures
in short pathways.2 Using the former approaches,
a long list of several highly sought after cyclic scaffolds were synthesized.
Benzofurans, for their frequent occurrence in natural products as
well as in pharmaceutically active molecules,3 with a variety of substitutions at both C2 and C3 could be easily
synthesized using this approach. Recently, some groups reported the
synthesis of the same scaffold with different substitution patterns,
usually complimentary, through the latter approach. For example, Bi
et al. reported a silver-catalyzed benzylic tosylation of o-hydroxyphenyl propargyl alcohols (o-HPPA)
as the precyclization event to get the cyclized product (3-tosylbenzofuran)
in tandem.4 The A3 coupling5 has also been successfully utilized by Sharghi,5b Rawat5d and Hajra5e as a tandem precyclization event to get 3-substituted
benzofurans.

On the other hand, o-quinone methides
(o-QMs) are found to be highly reactive transitory
intermediates
and have become a linchpin in the development of efficient synthetic
methods for various natural products and bioactive molecules.6 These momentary intermediates were extensively
used in nucleophilation with various nucleophiles toward diverse orthohydroxybenzyl
derivatives (Scheme 1a).7 Cycloaddition of the same with some
selected bifunctional nucleophilic counterparts for benzopyrans and
benzo-ε-lactones were also unveiled (Scheme 1b).8 Appendage
of an additional reactive finger to these o-QMs would
pave avenues for novel series of tandem reactions toward complex molecular
architectures. For example, the alkyne tether to these o-QMs would amplify the reactive area which can result in tandem cyclization
after initial additions toward unusual outcomes.9o-HPPAs are ready precursors (under reagent-/catalyst-free
conditions) for alkyne-tethered o-QMs which can be
used as nucleophile accepters prior to cyclization toward 3-substituted
benzofurans. In a seminal instance in this line, Du et al. reported
metal-free 3-phosphinoylbenzofurans through in situ generated o-QMs from the above readily available starting materials
(Scheme 1c).9b In protraction of our interest in uncovering
novel discoveries around functionalized alkynes,10 we developed a curiosity to investigate the possibility
of reactivities of other interesting nucleophiles which end up with
the installation of useful hetero tethers at C3 of benzofurans.

Scheme 1 (a–c) Reactions of o-QMs with Various Nucleophiles
Results and Discussion
On the basis of the above postulate, we commenced optimizing the
nucleophilic sulfonylative (with TsNa 2a) cyclization
of o-QM, an active in situ generated intermediate
from o-HPPA 1a (Table 1). We initially used the conditions developed
by Du et al. Thus, a reaction of 1a with 2a in DCE in the presence of K2CO3 at 70 °C
was initially conducted. Pleasingly, the desired product was formed
but only in moderate yield of 50% (entry 1). Change of base (both
inorganic and organic) did not incur much change in the reaction outcome
(entries 2–5). We reasoned that the in situ formed sulfonylative o-HPPA intermediate might underwent a reversible desulfonylation
(vide infra) before cyclization under high basic condition (to give
back o-QM followed by slow decomposition). To our
surprise and delight, the absence of any external base indeed led
to a clean conversion to afford 3-tosyl 2-benzyl benzofuran in 93%
yield (entry 6). We suppose that the byproduct NaOH, resulted from
tosylation, must have acted as a base required for oxy-cyclization
event. DCE was found as the most suitable solvent over the other tested
solvents (entries 7–12).

We next assessed the generality of this sulfa-Michael
addition/oxy-cyclization
process. We first planned to vary the reaction scope of o-HPPA (1a–1m) with TsNa 2a under the above optimized reaction conditions. The results are evidenced
in Table 2. Initially,
the effect of substitution on alkyne terminus of o-HPPA was studied. Electronically neutral alkyl-phenyl substrates 1b–c gave desired adducts in excellent
yields (3ba–ca in 85–86%).
The electron-rich methoxy phenyl substitution (1d) showed
transformation with similar high yield (3da, 84%). However,
the halo (F and Cl) phenyl moieties (1e–f) led to slight erosion of yields (3ea–fa in 71–74%). Pleasingly, the thiophenyl- and cyclohexenyl-substituted
analogues 1g–h were found to be equally
viable substrates for the reaction to afford the desired products 3ga–ha in 82–86% yield. Proceeding
further, the cyclic, acyclic, and aliphatic alkyne (cyclohexyl, cyclopentyl,
3-phenybutyl, and octyl) functionalities (1i–1l) were well tolerated by this metal-free sulfonylative cyclization
(75–81%). Quite interestingly, the TMS-tethered alkyne motif
(1m) was also well tolerated to give the corresponding
product 3ma in 48% yield (along with desillylative component 3mai in 20%). Next, setting a limitation,
our efforts to extend the reaction toward the synthesis of 3-sulfonylative
indole variants were proved to be totally unfruitful.

3-Ts Benzofuransa
a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol), TsNa
(0.75 mmol), in DCE (3 mL).

b Isolated yield.

We subsequently
investigated the scope of the conjugate addition/oxy-cyclization
mode with respect to salicylaldehyde derivatives (Table 3). The electron-donating −OEt-bearing
analogue 1n with TsNa gave the expected product 3na in 79% yield. Gratifyingly, highly reactive hydroxyl functional
group on core phenyl ring 1o contentedly survived in
given reaction condition. Further, the halo (Cl and Br) substituted
(irrespective of position) motifs 1p–s were cleanly converted to the anticipated 3-tosyl benzyl benzofurans
(3pa–sa) in 68–73% yields.
The electron-deficient NO2 counterpart 1t was
transformed to the desired product 3ta in 66% yield.
In further continuation, we next examined the reaction scope with
respect of sodium sulfinates. Thus, the neutral as well as electron-rich
aryl sulfinate salts 2b–c fruitfully
engaged with o-HPPA to form 3ab–ac in 78–82%, respectively. Sterically hindered napthyl
sulfinate 2d also functioned well to yield 3ar in 69%. The methyl sodium sulfinate salt (2e), as alkyl
counterpart, similarly delivered the final desired adduct in 68% yield.

Sulfinate Saltsa
a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol), RSO2Na (0.75 mmol), in DCE (3 mL).

b Isolated yield.

Further, we identified that the other sulfonyl synthons such as
toluenesulfonylmethyl isocyanide and tosyl hydrazines also successfully
deliver (eq 1) the desire
product (3aa from 1a), but the presence
of K2CO3 as base was essential and the reaction
totally failed in its absence. 1  

To ascertain the
applicability of this nucleophilation/oxy-cyclization
path, we then quested after the other potential nucleophilic precursors
to act on o-QM to deliver benzofuran adducts with
unusual C3-substitution. Thus, various hetero and carbophilic nucleophiles
have been extensively screened as shown in Scheme 2. Regrettably, these nucleophiles were ineffective
in the desired conjugate addition/oxy-cyclization process of o-QM (Scheme 2i–iv). Presumably, these strong nucleophiles are inapt to
react with in situ generated ephemeral and highly reactive o-QM intermediate. Finally, though unusual, the 1H-benzotriazoles (Scheme 2v) were found as new nucleophilic counterparts for
this aza-Michael addition/oxy-cyclization of o-QM
to deliver diheterocyclic adduct 5a. Use of K2CO3 as base was essential in this case.

Nucleophiles with o-QM
1a (0.5 mmol), NuX
(0.75 mmol), base (1.5 mmol), DCE (3 mL). For detailed description
see Experimental Section.

We then explored its generality with a series of benzotriazoles
(4) and o-HPPA, and the results are
outlined in Table 4. Thus, 1b in presence of base reacted well with 4 and the expected product 5b was obtained in
81% yield.

a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.5 mmol), 4 (0.75 mmol), base (1.5 mmol) in solvent (3
mL).

b Isolated yield.

The substrates with electron-rich
functionalities such as OMe and
OEt on alkyne terminus as well as core aryl group efficiently underwent
the desired transformation to produce expected products in good yields
(5c–d in 72–74%). However,
in case of halo (F, Cl, and Br) substituted counterparts (irrespective
of the position), the products were obtained in slightly diminished
yields when compared with electronically neutral substrates (5e–h in 62–68%). In contrast, the
thiophenyl substitution on alkyne terminal 1d showed
good reactivity to afford the desired product 5i in 73%
yield. In addition, the 5-methyl-substituted benzotriazole reacted
with electronically neutral and slightly electronically poor (F) o-HPPA (1a & 1e) and gave 5j–k (in 67 and 59%, respectively) in
almost a 1:1 mixture of regioisomeric ratio (because of nucleophilic
shuttling state in triazole ring). Nevertheless, the alkyl-substituted
alkynes were found to be ineffective in this conversion.

On
the basis of the investigational results and previous reports,
we proposed a possible reaction path for the title reaction (Scheme 3). Initially, o-QM intermediate is generated from o-HPPA
by expelling the water molecule. Conjugate addition of sulfinate salt
on o-QM gave sodium phenoxide intermediate b, which with liberated H2O produced NaOH (and c). This NaOH infact acted as the base required for the subsequent
deprotonation at benzylic position (allenyl isomerization) to give
allene intermediate d. As the in situ base formation
is not possible in case of benzotriazole as nucleophile, the external
base was essential. Intramolecular oxy-cyclization of d and 1,3-proton migration led to 3-hetero-substituted benzylbenzofuran 3 or 5.

Scheme 3 Proposed Reaction Mechanism
Conclusions
In
summary, we have illustrated a practically simple and efficient
approach for the synthesis of 3-heterosubstituted benzylbenzofurans
from readily available o-HPPA and sulfinate salts
or benzotriazoles. The reaction likely proceeds though sulfa-/aza-Michael
addition and oxy-cyclization of in situ generated o-QM as bifunctional ephemeral intermediate. The hetero nucleophiles
are thus embedded on somewhat electronically rich third position of
benzofurans through a catalyst-free process. Further investigations
on the enlargement of metal-free hetero-Michael addition reactions
are currently underway.

Screening of Various Nucleophiles
We screened various
nucleophiles for incorporation on o-QM. We carried
out a series of reactions using o-HPPA (1a) with different hetero nucleophiles such as KSCN, ROH (alkynols,
phenol, trichlroethanol, and triflouroethanol), amines (TsNH2, aniline, diphenylamine, piperidine-2,6-dione, oxy-indole, indoline,
indole, TMSN3, NaN3, imidazole, and benzimidazole),
and carbo nucleophiles (allyl silane, dimethyl malonate, ethylcyano
acetate, and 1,3-isndandione) in the presence of different bases (organic
and inorganic see Table 1 in manuscript) in dry DCE.

Benzotriazoles as Nucleophiles
Benzotriazoles
were
found as new nucleophilic counterparts for this aza-Michael addition/oxy-cyclization
of o-QM. Then, we screened the reaction parameters.
Thus, base and solvent K2CO3 gave best results
over the other tested bases. DCE is the suitable solvent for this
aza-Michael/oxy-cyclization event.

To a 15 mL Schlenk tube was added o-hydroxyl phenyl propargylic alcohol 1a (112
mg, 0.5 mmol), benzotriazole 4a (89.5 mg, 0.75 mmol),
K2CO3 (207 mg, 1.5 mmol) in anhydrous DCE (3
mL), sealing the Schlenk tube without degassing, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at 80 °C until complete conversion of the
starting material (12 h for 5a–5d, 14 h for 5e–5h and 16 h for 5i–5k). After removal of the solvent under
reduced pressure, the crude material was purified on silica gel using
20% EtOAc/hexane to get 5a (140 mg, 86%) as off-white solid.
