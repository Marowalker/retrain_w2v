We demonstrate the control of resonance
characteristics of a drum-type
graphene mechanical resonator in a nonlinear oscillation regime using
the photothermal effect, which is induced by a standing wave of light
between graphene and a substrate. Unlike the resonance characteristics
of a conventional Duffing-type nonlinearity, those of the nonlinear
oscillation regime are modulated by the standing wave of light with
a contribution of the scattered light of an actuation laser, despite
a slight variation of amplitude. Numerical calculations conducted
with a combination of equations of heat and motion with the Duffing-type
nonlinearity explain this modulation: the photothermal effect delays
the modulation of graphene stress or tension.

1 Introduction
Graphene
has attracted much attention as a nanoelectromechanical
system (NEMS) component because of its superb mechanical and electrical
properties. Especially in terms of a graphene NEMS, a graphene mechanical
resonator (G-MR)1−10 is expected to be a highly sensitive mass and force sensor and a
component of the computing application. To improve the G-MR sensitivity,
it is important to realize a nanomechanical resonator with a high
quality factor (Q-factor). The intrinsic Q-factor depends solely on the material itself, so the modulation
of the intrinsic Q-factor is not easy. By contrast,
the apparent Q-factor can be modulated easily by
modulating the loss part of the motion of the resonator by application
of the active11,12 or passive feedback13−15 to the resonating system under a linear response regime. In the
case of passive feedback, the photothermal self-oscillation and laser
cooling of the G-MR with a Fabry–Perot cavity between graphene
and the substrate have been demonstrated by photothermal back-action
induced, respectively, by positive and negative feedback under a linear
oscillation regime.3 This photothermal
back-action was analyzed based on the delayed response component in
the resonating system.8,15 In addition to linear oscillation,
nonlinear effects on mechanical resonators, which are commonly described
by the Duffing effect at large oscillation amplitude, are important
for the improvement of sensitivity or other applications such as mode
coupling toward computing applications.6,7,16−22 Nevertheless, few reports describe resonance control of the G-MR
in a nonlinear resonance regime with the delayed component using optical
back-action.4,6 In addition, the delayed component
using optical back-action with a steep optical field gradient should
have position dependence. Therefore, we must analyze the combination
of the Duffing-type nonlinear equation and the delayed-time component
with position dependence. Unfortunately, because equations of this
type present difficulty in obtaining accurate analytical solutions,
detailed analysis of the nonlinear resonance and control of its resonance
properties of the G-MR in a nonlinear regime persist as challenging
tasks. This study demonstrates resonance control of the G-MR in the
nonlinear resonance regime with a Fabry–Perot cavity using
optical back-action induced by the standing wave of light in the Fabry–Perot
cavity. In addition to the experiment, we conduct numerical calculations
to investigate the relation between nonlinearity and the position-dependent
delayed-time component induced by optical back-action in the nonlinear
oscillation regime.

2 Results and Discussion
This study investigated a drum-type
G-MR similar to that presented
schematically in Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows
that the drum-type G-MR with a 5.4 μm diameter was fabricated
successfully. Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the graphene
degradation after the fabrication process. Figure 1c shows that the D band originating from
the defects on the Raman spectrum at the suspended part of the G-MR
is rarely observed. This result implies that this fabrication process
induces no significant degradation of graphene.

part of the drum-type G-MR.

Figure 2a
shows
that the resonance of the drum-type G-MR was measured using optical
detection methods in vacuum at approx. 10–3 Pa.
The intensity of light interference induced between the G-MR and the
Si substrate was measured to ascertain the displacement of the G-MR.
A laser, used as a probe, irradiated the center of the drum with wavelengths
of 406 or 521 nm. To oscillate the G-MR, a 660 nm wavelength laser
was irradiated on the substrate near the support edge of the G-MR
with a spot diameter of approx. 1 μm, as illustrated schematically
in Figure 2a, which
was modulated at a certain frequency f through an
objective lens with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.7.

(c) Resonance curve measured under various actuation laser intensities,
where the wavelength and the intensity of the probe laser are 406
nm and 6.3 μW, respectively. Frequency f is
normalized by the resonance frequency f0 (approx. 9.83 MHz) at linear oscillation.

Figure 2b
portrays
the graphene position dependence of the induced heat on the G-MR by
the interfered probe laser light between the graphene and the Si substrate,
which were calculated using the finite element method, where the complex
refractive indexes of graphene (2.6 – 1.3i)23 and Si (5.6 – 0.4i at 400 nm)24 were used. The gray area between 300 and 335 nm corresponds
to the graphene height from the substrate deduced from the SiO2 and electrode thickness, as illustrated schematically in
the inset of Figure 2b, where the possibility that the graphene edge partially adheres
to the side of the Au electrodes exists. The graphene height was difficult
to measure accurately using atomic force microscopy (AFM) because
of insufficient tension of graphene, which caused unexpected perturbation
on the AFM image. In the gray area, the slopes of the profiles for
wavelengths λp of 406 and 521 nm were opposite. This
difference causes a different response of the photothermal effect
induced by the probe laser on the drum-type G-MR for respective λp. The thermal expansion coefficient, α, of graphene
is negative (−8 × 10–6 K–1) at around room temperature.25 Therefore,
higher heat generation at graphene induces higher stress10 or tension of the graphene membrane.

Figure 2c presents
an example of a frequency response curve of the drum-type G-MR taken
from lower frequency (f0 ≈ 9.83
MHz at the resonance of the linear oscillation regime), where the
actuation laser intensity (Pact) was changed
from 296 to 736 μW with λp = 406 nm. All frequency
response curves presented in this paper were taken from the lower
frequency. At a higher intensity of actuation, a hardening-type nonlinear
vibration is clearly observed, where the resonance curve deforms from
symmetrical to unsymmetrical and where the resonance peak shifts toward
a higher frequency with increasing actuation.

The nonlinear
vibration observed here can be excited by increasing
the amplitude, which led to the appearance of the nonlinearity term
in resilience. In this case, the Duffing-type equation of motion with
an external force F cos ωt is applicable with amplitude x described as 1  where m stands for the mass
of the G-MR, γ signifies linear damping related to the Q-factor, k0 represents the
intrinsic spring constant, β is the nonlinear coefficient (the
Duffing constant), and ω denotes the angular frequency. The
spring constant of the drum-type G-MR is ascertained from the stress
or tension acting on the graphene. At low amplitude, k0 is deduced to be constant, whereas at larger amplitude,
the graphene deflection induces additional hardening like k0 + Δk, which results
in nonlinear vibration. Results confirmed that the resonance properties
under the linear regime showed no marked dependence of Pp (6.30–9.28 μW), as shown in Figure S2 of
the Supporting Information. This result
implies that no marked modulation of γ or k0 under the linear regime is induced by the photothermal
effect attributable to the standing wave of the probe lasers.

To modify the resonance characteristics of the G-MR in the nonlinear
oscillation regime using the interference light, the probe laser intensity
(Pp) dependence was investigated at Pact = 516 μW corresponding to the weak
nonlinear oscillation presented in Figure 2c. Figure 3a depicts the frequency response curves obtained at
various probe laser intensities from 6.30 to 9.28 μW for respective
λp. The frequency responses show weak nonlinearity
for both λp. For detailed analysis of the nonlinearity,
we evaluated the slopes of the frequency response of the phase shift
dφ/df at the resonance as the measure of its
nonlinearity, where φ is the phase shift between the deflection
of the G-MR and the actuation force. Briefly, in the linear oscillation
regime, dφ/df is determined by 2m/γ, which is expected to be independent of λp. For the nonlinear oscillation regime, the frequency response of
the phase shift shows an abrupt change from positive to negative,
so-called the jumping phenomenon, so that dφ/df at the resonance is infinity. Consequently, one can expect that
the weak nonlinear condition corresponding to the intermediate region
gives a certain slope dφ/df depending on the
nonlinearity. It is noteworthy that, in the case of the conventional
nonlinear oscillation governed by eq 1, the frequency at the resonance shifts to a higher
frequency with increasing amplitude. The nonlinearity increases with
increasing amplitude.

Figure 3 Nonlinearity control of the drum-type G-MR by the interference
of light. (a) Frequency response curves with various probe laser intensities Pp measured by λp = 406 and
521 nm under Pact = 516 μW. Arrows
indicate respective resonances, where the frequency f is normalized by the resonance frequency at the linear response
measured under weak actuation. (b) Probe laser intensity Pp dependence of the amplitude at the resonance shown in
(a). (c) Probe laser intensity Pp dependence
of nonlinearity determined by dφ/df. Solid
lines are a guide for the eyes.

Figure 3b,c
present
the probe laser intensity dependence of the maximum amplitude and
nonlinearity dφ/df at the resonance, respectively.
For λp = 406 nm, the dφ/df at the resonance decreased despite the slight increase in amplitude
that occurred with increasing Pp. Moreover,
as clearly portrayed in Figure 3a, the peak position for λp = 406 nm shifts
0.4% toward lower frequency with increasing Pp. These changes induced by the probe laser are completely
opposite for the conventional nonlinear phenomenon explained by eq 1. For λp = 521 nm, the amplitude at the resonance shows no significant probe
laser intensity dependence. The peak position at the resonance fluctuates
within 0.3% and shows no specific dependence. Only nonlinearity dφ/df increases with increasing Pp, which is the opposite dependence observed at λp = 406 nm, which might derive from the opposite slopes of the profiles
of the standing wave of the probe laser presented in Figure 2b. The changes cannot be explained
using the conventional Duffing equation described by eq 1. It is noteworthy that the resonance
characteristics in the linear regime show no significant change for
changing the probe laser intensity as described above. Note that the
scattered light from the actuation laser may modify the nonlinear
property because of the additional photothermal effects on the resonance.

To investigate the unexpected resonance properties in the nonlinear
regime, we consider the delayed time response, which was regarded
as the origin of the modification of the resonance properties in the
linear resonance regime.13 For the linear
resonance regime, the delayed time response on the oscillating system
acts on the phase component, which leads to the modulation of damping,
γ.13,14 A similar delay component induced by the
photothermal effect of the standing wave of light should be considered
for the G-MR under a nonlinear regime. The temperature change of the
G-MR, Δθ, modifies the stress or tension acting on graphene.
Actually, Δθ depends not only on position x but also on time t attributable to thermal relaxation
time τth determined by the heat capacity and the
thermal resistance, where the heat capacity considered here is expected
to include not only graphene itself but also the substrate in contact
with the graphene. In the case of a nonlinear oscillator with the
time-delayed component, the analytical solution is difficult to obtain.

Assuming a linear relation between the spring constant and temperature,
the ratio of the spring constant Δk/k is given as 2  where α denotes the temperature coefficient
of the spring constant difference. In the case of an one-atom-thick
resonator, the spring constant mainly comes from its tension.26 For simplicity, we assumed the graphene resonator
as a linear string with length l and concentrated
mass m at the center of the string, the spring constant
and the resonance frequency ω0 are expressed as k = 4T0/l and , where T0 is
the internal strain of the resonator. The internal strain of graphene, T0, can be obtained from the resonance frequency
(9.86 MHz) at the linear response regime to be 1 × 10–7 N. Using the thermal expansion coefficient, α, and Young’s
modulus, E, of graphene (−8 × 10–6/K and 1 TPa), the tension is modified by temperature
with αAE ≈ 1.36 × 10–8 N/K, where A is the cross-sectional area of the
graphene resonator (5 μm wide and 0.34 nm thick). As a result,
one can estimate it as α0 = 0.15/K from αAE/T0.

Additionally, the
position dependence of the probe laser-induced
heat is approximated as linear because of its small oscillation amplitude
compared to the gap separating graphene and the substrate. For simplicity,
the time t is scaled by ω0 as τ
= ω0t, which is a nondimensional
parameter. In addition, we infer that this simplified model with a
lumped capacitance model for the heat equation, Δθ, is
applicable as 3  where q0 is a
slope of the position dependence of the induced heat normalized by
the system heat capacity on graphene given by mC and
ω0, which is defined from Pp and profiles of the photogenerated heat, as presented in Figure 2b, where C is the heat capacity of graphene. In addition, the photothermal
effect from the scattered light of the actuation laser is also implemented
as described by the third term of the right hand side, where Pscat is the light intensity of the scattered
light of the actuation laser normalized by the system heat capacity
on graphene and ω0. This expression is similar to
the case described in an earlier report13 for linear oscillation, except for the position dependence term q0x(t) proposed
here. Consequently, the additional spring constant Δk is expected to be a function with nonlinear dependence
on t and x as Δk(x,t). In this case, the Duffing-type
motion equation described by eq 1 using τ = ω0t is
now modified to 4  where Q is the quality factor
determined as Q–1 = γ/mω0 and x0 = F/mω02 = F/k. The term Δk(x,t) consists of higher order
terms of x with certain phase shifts resulting from
the time-delayed component, which gives rise to the modification of Q and β in addition to the spring constant itself.
In the case of the one-atom-thick resonator, the Duffing term comes
mainly from its tension depending on the vibration amplitude.26 On the basis of the same assumption as the string
mentioned before, the Duffing term is expressed as 5  where ωE2 = 4AE/ml. Solving simultaneous differential eqs 2–5 numerically,
one can qualitatively evaluate the photothermal
effect induced by the probe laser, where we also scaled the position
variable x by x0 for
simplicity. Parameters used in this calculation are presented in Table 1. As a reference,
the nonlinear behavior of this model was examined as portrayed in Figure 4a, where the driving
amplitude x0 was changed without the photothermal
effect induced by the probe laser. A linear response is obtainable
at x0 = 1. Nonlinearity with an apparent
hardening effect increases with increased driving amplitude. The jumping
phenomenon on the frequency response curve is readily apparent.

To evaluate the effect of the delayed time constant
τth on nonlinearity, ω0τth is used as a parameter13 with
the ratio
of the oscillation period at linear oscillation, ω0–1, and the delayed time constant τth. At ω0τth < 1 corresponding
to the faster response of temperature to the oscillation period, the
nonlinearity decreases with increasing ω0τth, which indicates that the fast response, that is, no delay
effect, imparts no effect on the phase component of the resonator.
Consequently, the nonlinearity returns to the original state with
decreasing ω0τth. In the case of
ω0τth > 1 corresponding to a
slow
temperature response, the nonlinearity increases with increasing ω0τth as observed in Figure 4c. The temperature modulation induced by
the oscillation is decreased, finally becoming zero at longer τth, which results in the elimination of the delayed effect.
The delayed time response greatly influences the resonance characteristics.
The condition of ω0τth ≈
2 is most efficient to suppress the nonlinearity of the resonator
as shown in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information, which closely resembles the case for laser cooling of the mechanical
resonator.8

Figure 4d presents
the light intensity of the probe laser dependence of the frequency
response at ω0τth = 2 without the
scattering of the actuation laser, that is, Pscat = 0. The nonlinearity decreases with increasing light
intensity. The amplitude at the resonance is ∼0.7, which is
much greater than the 0.2 obtained in the case of no delay effect
portrayed in Figure 4a. Further increase of q0 has a softening
effect on the resonance characteristics. These results indicate that
the delay effect does not merely suppress the nonlinearity by decreasing
the amplitude as the conventional nonlinear oscillator: it directly
reduces the nonlinear term in eq 4. However, the effect of the slope difference of the standing
wave of the probe laser cannot be explained.

Figure 5 shows simulated
frequency response curves for ω0τth and probe light intensity dependences with a positive or negative
slope of the profiles of the probe laser, where the contribution of
the scattered light from the actuation laser (1% of x0) was implemented as described in eq 3. In this case, a clear slope dependence of
nonlinearity appeared. In the case of the negative slope corresponding
to the 406 nm probe laser, nonlinearity is suppressed at larger ω0τth without a certain minimum as shown in Figure 5a and Figure S3c
of the Supporting Information. On the contrary,
the clear nonlinearity at the positive slope of the probe laser profile
corresponding to the 521 nm probe laser is observed at all of ω0τth even with the larger ω0τth, which is different from the case without the
scattered light effect as shown in Figure 5b (see also Figure S3d of Supporting Information). As can be observed in Figure 5c, the decrease of the suppression
of the nonlinearity is enhanced at higher q0 at the negative slope. Further increase of q0 induces softening nonlinearity. In the case of the positive
slope, the suppression of the nonlinearity is hardly observed. Thus,
the combination of the probe laser and the scattered light of the
actuation laser is required for the development of the slope dependence
of the nonlinearity modification.

Frequency response curves calculated with various delayed time constants
for the negative or positive slope of the probe laser profile. (c,d)

We performed numerical simulations
to fit the simulated results
to experimental data as shown in Figure S4, where the probe laser intensity dependences of the amplitude and
nonlinearity were investigated under the condition of the presence
of the probe laser and the scattered light of the actuation laser. Figure 6 represents the best
fit to the experimental data. Note that the actual laser intensity
dependence of q0 on the photothermal effect
is unknown, so that the horizontal axis was adjusted with an arbitrary
ratio of the actual probe laser intensity and q0. The thermal relaxation time ω0τth, and the scattered light intensity are the dominant fitting
parameters. Apparently, both the vibration amplitude and the nonlinearity
(dφ/df) obtained from the experiments agree
with the results of the numerical simulation.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated control of drum-type
G-MR nonlinearity using the
photothermal effect induced by the standing wave of light between
graphene and the substrate, that is, a Fabry–Perot cavity.
Unlike the conventional Duffing-type nonlinearity, the nonlinearity
was modulated with a slight oscillation amplitude variation by changing
the probe laser wavelength and intensity. This phenomenon is explainable:
the delayed thermal response induced by the photothermal effect causes
the modulation of the effective spring constant of the graphene membrane
in the phase space. We used numerical calculations consisting of the
heat equation and the Duffing-type equation of motion with the delayed-time
response to investigate the modulation of resonance characteristics
in a nonlinear oscillation regime. Results show that the weak amplitude
dependence of nonlinearity observed in the experimentally obtained
results was qualitatively consistent with the calculated results.
We believe that this modification of oscillation characteristics in
a nonlinear regime opens the way to realize an NEMS circuit using
nonlinear effects such as up-conversion of the frequency or mode coupling.

4 Experimental Section
The sample fabrication process
is illustrated schematically in
Figure S1 of the Supporting Information. First, metal electrodes consisting of Cr/Au (5 nm/30 nm) as a support
of the graphene drum were fabricated on a heavily doped Si substrate
with a 300 nm-thick SiO2 layer using conventional photolithography
processing (Figure S1b). Subsequently,
after the monolayer graphene was transferred onto the substrate using
polymethyl methacrylate (Figure S1c), it
was trimmed using oxygen plasma etching to form the drum-type G-MR
(Figure S1d), where graphene was synthesized
using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition at 1000 °C using
a Cu foil as a catalyst.27,28 To form the drum-type
G-MR suspended by metal electrodes, the SiO2 layer underneath
the graphene drum was etched using buffered hydrofluoric acid (Figure S1e), where the metal electrodes are used
as the metal mask for etching. Trenches at both sides of the drum
were necessary for uniform etching of the SiO2 layer. They
served as an evacuation channel for the air between the graphene drum
and the substrate during the measurement of resonance characteristics.
The samples thus fabricated were finally dried using supercritical
drying to prevent sticking of the suspended graphene induced by the
surface tension of water.
