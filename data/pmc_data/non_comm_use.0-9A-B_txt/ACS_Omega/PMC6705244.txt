We explore the stability, electronic
properties, and quantum capacitance
of doped/co-doped graphene with B, N, P, and S atoms based on first-principles
methods. B, N, P, and S atoms are strongly bonded with graphene, and
all of the relaxed systems exhibit metallic behavior. While graphene
with high surface area can enhance the double-layer capacitance, its
low quantum capacitance limits its application in supercapacitors.
This is a direct result of the limited density of states near the
Dirac point in pristine graphene. We find that the triple N and S
doping with single vacancy exhibits a relatively stable structure
and high quantum capacitance. It is proposed that they could be used
as ideal electrode materials for symmetry supercapacitors. The advantages
of some co-doped graphene systems have been demonstrated by calculating
quantum capacitance. We find that the N/S and N/P co-doped graphene
with single vacancy is suitable for asymmetric supercapacitors. The
enhanced quantum capacitance contributes to the formation of localized
states near the Dirac point and/or Fermi-level shifts by introducing
the dopant and vacancy complex.

1 Introduction
Supercapacitors
with a simple charging circuit have high power
delivery and long lifetime and are thus widely used in a wide temperature
range.1−8 They are also called electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), and
their capacitance is much higher than that of traditional dielectric
capacitors. In conventional capacitors, metals are used as electrodes
and the limited surface area hinders the enhancement of capacitance.
In supercapacitors, different kinds of carbon materials are generally
used and the electrode–electrolyte interface with large area
makes the improvement of capacitance possible since the charges can
be stored electrostatically with reversible adsorption of ions at
the interface. Graphene is a single-atom-layer material and has been
promising in EDLCs in recent years.9−11 However, in the experiments,
such as those of Biener et al.,12,13 graphene-based electrodes
were used and the results are contrary to what is expected. For an
ideal metal, perfect screening can result in the confinement of excess
charge on its surface. Therefore, its capacitance can be ignored when
it is used as part of the electrode.14 However,
graphene-based materials do not undergo good screening due to the
low density of free electrons. It has been noted that the quantum
capacitance of these materials plays an important role15 when they are used as electrode materials. From
the theoretical work of Paek and co-workers,14 quantum capacitance of graphene is the key limiting factor affecting
the total capacitance when it is used as part of electrode. In addition,
pristine graphene has also been limited by poor accessibility to the
electrolyte in practical implementation.10,16−19

With low-dimensional materials as electrodes, for example,
carbon
nanotubes and graphene, total capacitance CT is a reflection of the overall effect of electrode capacitance (also
named quantum capacitance CQ) and double-layer
capacitance CD, with the theoretical relationship20−23 1/CT = 1/CQ + 1/CD. Although the CQ value of pristine graphene is limited, in graphene-like
two-dimensional systems, CQ is comparable
to CD. Some theoretical works have demonstrated
that the quantum capacitance of graphene could be modulated by different
ways, including nonmetal and metal doping, metal adsorption, and vacancy
defects.24−30 Experimental works have shown that the doping with defects or functionalization
of graphene can improve the capacitance considerably.31 To date, experimental works have been focused on co-doped
graphene supercapacitor materials such as the co-doping of N/S and
N/P.31−38 It has been noted that the theoretical research on the quantum capacitance
of co-doped graphene is insufficient, especially for N/S(P) co-doping.
The concentration effect of co-doping, interaction between heteroatoms,
and structure stability issues introduced via the doping have been
almost ignored.

In this paper, critical issues of graphene-based
materials as the
electrodes of supercapacitor have been investigated using first-principles
methods. We examined the effects of doping/co-doping with dopants,
including B, N, P, and S atoms; concentration of dopants; and the
ratio of dopants in co-doping on the stability, electronic structure,
and quantum capacitance of graphene. The electronic properties of
N/S, N/P, and P/S co-doped graphene, the interaction between doped
atoms, and the influence on the CQ–V curves have been investigated in detail. The quantum capacitance
has been found to be enhanced based on proper doping with defects.
We discussed the ways these doping experiments were used to improve
the overall performance of graphene-based electrode materials.

2 Computational Methods
All of the calculations were
performed by the projector-augmented
wave potentials method on the basis of density functional theory (DFT)
as implemented in the VASP code.39,40 The generalized
gradient approximation41 with the parameterization
of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof was used to express the exchange–correlation
energy of interacting electrons. The high-density k-space integral with plane-wave basis set was chosen to ensure that
the total energy was converged at 1 meV/atom level. For the plane-wave
expansion, the kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV was determined to be
sufficient. The Monkhorst–Pack method was used to sample the k-points in the Brillouin zone. We chose the lattice constant
of graphene with 2.465 Å, which was consistent with the experimental
results. On the basis of primitive cell, four hexagonal structures
as the ideal models in Figure 1 have been used to simulate the doping effect, including the
dopants B, N, P, and S, considering the spin polarization effect.
The vacuum space of 18 Å along the Z direction
is selected in the supercell method. The Brillouin zones of 6 ×
6, 5 × 5, 4 × 4, and 3 × 3 supercells were sampled
with the Γ-centered k-point grids of 8 ×
8 × 1, 10 × 10 × 1, 12 × 12 × 1, and 16 ×
16 × 1, respectively.

Figure 1 Atomic structures of proposed doping models
of graphene, including
(a) quaternary N(B, P, S)-doped graphene (model-a); (b–d) single-vacancy
graphene with the single pyridine-N (B, P, S) doping (mode-b), double-N
(B, P, S) doping (model-c), and triple-N (B, P, S) doping (model-d);
and (e–g) single-vacancy graphene with the NNS(P) co-doping
(model-e), NSS(P) co-doping (model-f), and NS(P) co-doping (model-g).

The electrochemical potential μ can be altered
rigidly by
the local potential Φ with the formula μ = eΦ, where e is the elementary charge. Therefore,
on the electrode, the excess charge density can be obtained by modulating
the local potential with the formula42 1  where D(E) is the calculated density
of states (DOS), f(E) is the Fermi–Dirac
distribution function, and E is the energy of Fermi
level EF. The quantum capacitance is expressed
as CQ = dQ/dΦ,
where dQ and dΦ represent the differentials
of local charge density
and local potential, respectively. Using the analytical expression
(eq 1) of ΔQ, the quantum capacitance CQ can be written as14 2  where the thermal broadening function FT(E) is represented as  In the calculation, the temperature is set
to 300 K, kB is the Boltzmann constant,
and high-accuracy D(E) is calculated
from DFT using a linear interpolation method for the integral calculation.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Geometric and Electronic
Properties of Doped
Graphene
We have selected B, N, P, and S as the dopants for
graphene, to investigate the effect of different dopants on the electronic
properties. The structural models including the doping and co-doping
are shown in Figure 1a–g. The calculation results show a C–C bond length
of 1.403 Å for pristine graphene, which is consistent with the
previous calculation.43 Structural parameters,
containing C–X bond lengths, X–X bond lengths, C–X–C
bond angles, formation energy ΔEf, and Bader charge ρB from the graphene plane are
listed in Table S1. In the relaxed structure
of the P-doping (S-doping) with the quaternary doping model (model-a)
in Figure 1a, the atom
of P(S) is projected out of the graphene plane with P(S)–C
bond length of 1.61(1.62) Å and C–P(S)–C bond angle
of 120.01°. Along with P(S)-atom protrusion, three nearest-neighboring
carbon atoms protrude from the graphene plane, and the length of the
neighboring C–C bond is changed from 1.402 to 1.394 Å
(1.382 Å). Among the four doping models in Figure 1a–d, the N (or B)-doped graphene with
model-a has notable lower value for the calculated formation energies,
as shown in Table S1. The formation energies
in doping systems with model-a are in the order of S > P > B
> N.
In general, compared to carbon atoms, the size and electronegativity
of atomic dopants have significant effects on the stability of doped
graphene structure. The larger atomic size and the lower electronegativity25,44 of the dopants result in the decrease of structure stability. The
N atom has a higher electronegativity and relatively smaller atomic
size comparable to carbon atom. Thus, in the case of model-a system,
the N doping graphene is the most stable.

From Table S1, we can find that the stability is enhanced with
increasing doping concentration for the B-, N-, and S-doping with
single vacancy based on model-b, model-c, and model-d of the same
dopant (Figure 1b–d),
while the P-doping shows an opposite behavior. The formation energies
with model-d are in the order of P > B > N > S, and the P-doped
graphene
structure shows the largest formation energy among the investigated
structures, which suggests that the structure is very unstable. In
the structures of triple-B, -N, and -S doping with model-d, the presence
of single vacancy assists the structures to be more stable with lower
formation energies. For the triple-P doping, it may be due to the
largest size of dopant, which induces the higher formation energy.
According to Bader analysis, the charge transfer occurs from B, P,
and S atoms to graphene because of the lower electronegativity of
B, P, and S than C, and only N atom shows an opposite behavior.

For the co-doping, such as N/S, N/P, and P/S in Table S1, the dopants occupy the sites around vacancies in
the models. Such configurations are more stable than other configurations
with dopants on other sites away from vacancies. It is found that
the formation energies of N/S and N/P co-doping are smaller than that
of P/S. In Table S1, it is also indicated
that the N/S and N/P co-doping is even more stable than the single-element
doping models with vacancies in Figure 1b–d. In experiments, graphene oxides are generally
used as the precursor and the defects of vacancies are popular in
the synthesized graphene. In these co-doped graphene, the configurations
with the complex of dopants around vacancies are popular, as reported
in experiments about N/S and N/P co-doping.31−38

Figure S1 in the Supporting Information
shows the DOSs of pristine graphene, the B-, N-, P-, and S-doping
with model-a in Figure 1a. For the doped graphene, all of these dopants result in the shift
of Fermi level with a small band gap at the Dirac point. The dopant
B results in p-type doping, and others result in n-type doping. From
the DOS of pyridine B-, N-, P-, and S-doping with model-b, the B-doping
introduces obvious localized states near Fermi level in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information. For
double-B-, N-, P-, and S-doping with model-c in Figure 1c, only the P-doping has no localized states
near the Fermi level (Figure S3 in the
Supporting Information). For the triple B-, N-, P-, and S-doping with
model-d in Figure 1d, all of them have higher localized states near Fermi level (Figures S4 and S5).
To evaluate the effect of N/S, N/P, and P/S co-doped graphene on the
supercapacitor performance, the DOS and LDOS of these co-doped systems
are considered in Figures S6–S8 in
the Supporting Information. The change of electronic properties will
be discussed in detail in the next section.

Figure 2 shows the
band-decomposed charge density isosurfaces above and below Fermi level
from −0.5 to 0.5 eV for the triple B-, N-, P-, and S-doping
with model-d. In all of the cases, the charges near Fermi level are
distributed mainly around the vacancy. Compared to the charges of
triple B- and S-doping, the charge distributions of triple N- and
P-doping are more localized. In the case of triple-B(N, P)-doped graphene,
the Fermi level has the trend of moving down to the valence band of
the pristine graphene due to electron deficiency, while the triple-S-doped
Fermi level moves up to the conduction band, in Figure S5 in the Supporting Information. This can be understood
by the basic chemical valance states about the configurations with
three dopant atoms around single vacancy. For example, three P (N)
atoms around vacancy have 15 valance electrons and 4 C atoms in pristine
graphene have 16 valence electrons. Thus, compared to Fermi level
at the Dirac point of pristine graphene, the Fermi level of triple-B
(N, P) doping around vacancy will be shifted down. In Figure S5(b) in the Supporting Information, with
the case of triple-N doping as example, the bands near Fermi level
indicate that there are two degenerate states (quasi-localized) and
one nonlocal state at Γ point. In addition, the bands near Fermi
level are spin-polarized for the cases of N and P doping. For these
electronic structures, we can expect that when excess holes are injected,
the states associated with the N lone pairs will be emptied first.

Band-decomposed charge density isosurfaces (5.3 ×
10–3 e/Å3) above and below Fermi
level from −0.5 to 0.5 eV for the triple-B(N, P, S)-doped graphene

3.2 Quantum
Capacitance of Doped Graphene
Figure 3 shows the
calculated quantum capacitances for doping graphene with the models
in Figure 1a–d,
based on eq 2. The CQ resembles their respective DOS profiles under
thermal broadening. In a previous report, CQ of pristine graphene has a minimum value around 0.58 μF/cm2 at zero applied potential, where the Dirac point is located
(note that the value of CQ under zero
potential is zero without thermal effect).45 In experiment,46 the measured minimum CQ of pristine graphene was reported to be 2.5
μF/cm2. The significant disparity of graphene’s
quantum capacitance between the experimental and theoretical values
results from the fact that there is no perfect structure of graphene
in the experiment. It is clearly seen that the doping alters the DOS
of graphene, thus CQ is modified. All
of these doping systems about graphene are liable to have highly irregular CQ profiles, with sharp local enhancement near
the neutral point.

Figure 3 Calculated quantum capacitance (CQ)
as a function of local electrode potential (Φ) for the B(N,P,S)-doped
graphene with (a) model-a, (b) model-b, (c) model-c, and (d) model-d.
The results are obtained with the supercell 4 × 4.

For the quaternary-B, -N, -P, and -S doping based on model-a
in Figure 1a, the local
maxima
of CQ near 0 V are 55.1, 58.5, 90.3, and
81.2 μF/cm2, respectively. By checking whether the CQ values under positive and negative bias voltages
are similar, we can define the symmetric and asymmetric behaviors.
We can observe that the CQ values of the
single-B (model-b) and triple-S (model-d) doping do not have obvious
difference under positive and negative bias voltages and thus exhibit
symmetric behavior, whereas the double-B, -N, and -S doping (mode-c)
have obvious asymmetric behavior. At larger negative bias, quaternary-P,
-S-doped graphene with model-a shows a huge quantum capacitance, while
triple N, S doping with model-d shows a higher quantum capacitance
under smaller bias, negative or positive. It is because of the higher
density of states near the Fermi level compared to other doped systems.
Based on the doping models in Figure 1b–d, the quantum capacitance enhances, with
increasing N and S concentrations from single-atom doping to triple-atom
doping. For the B-doping, as the concentration increases, it decreases
first and then increases. For the P-doping, the enhancement of quantum
capacitance is not very high. For the triple B-, N-, P-, and S-doping,
the local maxima of CQ near zero bias
are 70.9, 118.4, 75.3, and 93.5 μF/cm2, respectively.
This indicates that the triple-atom doping with single vacancy can
obviously increase the CQ value of pristine
graphene. Especially, the triple N- and S-doping show a markedly improved CQ. They also exhibit a lower formation energy
suggesting a more stable structure. Based on these results, the triple-N,
S doping (Figure 3d)
is strongly recommended for use as an electrode in symmetric supercapacitors.
On the other hand, the double-N, S doping graphene (Figure 3c) has broad application prospects
as the electrode material of asymmetric supercapacitors.

The
surface charge density at some potential drop Φ is obtained
by the formula 3  where CQ(V) is quantum capacitance
at local electrode potential V. Figure 4 shows the surface charge density
vs potential drop Φ at a
given electrode potential for different dopants. The doped graphene
electrodes can generally store more charge than pristine graphene
with the change of potential drop from −0.6 to 0.6 V. The increase
in charge capacity is attributed to the direct result of additional
availability of states near Fermi level. The results show that charge
accumulation under negative bias is more advantageous for the quaternary-S(P)
doping with model-a, and positive bias for the triple-N doping with
model-d. Scilicet, getting the same electrode charge density, a lower
positive Φ is sufficient for the triple-N doping. However, it
is also clear that these electrodes no longer store charges symmetrically.
As a consequence, the different doping types may be suited for different
terminals. Among these models in Figure 1, the triple-atom doping with single vacancy
(model-d) exhibits the best performance. The triple-N doping is the
best at positive Φ, and the triple-S doping is the best at negative
Φ.

Figure 4 Surface charge vs potential drop Φ between −0.6 and
0.6 eV for the B(N,P,S)-doped graphene with (a) model-a, (b) model-b,
(c) model-c, and (d) model-d. The results are obtained with the supercell
4 × 4.

The concentration effect of the
triple-S doping with model-d is
also investigated. The S concentration is changed by modulating the
ratio of 3S+ vacancy complex and C atoms with supercell methods. Due
to the contribution of the 3S+ vacancy complex, the DOS of graphene
near Fermi level has been changed significantly (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). With the increase
of S concentration, the curve of CQ and
the surface charge vs potential drop Φ at a given electrode
potential for different S concentrations is shown in Figure 5. With S doping, the location
of the local minimum under negative bias voltage shifts to about 0.2–0.4
V, as S concentration increases from 4.2 to 16.7%. The maximum value
of CQ increases from 55.2 to 93.5 μF/cm2 at approximately zero bias. Clearly, following the increase
of the concentration of 3S+ vacancy complex, CQ and surface charge are increased for small potential drop.
In addition, the energy region of potential drop with high CQ value becomes broad. These can be attributed
to the increase of localized states near Fermi level. In addition,
with the increase of defect concentration, the interaction between
defects becomes obvious and results in the broadening of energy region
of localized states near Fermi level.

Figure 5 (a) Calculated quantum capacitance (CQ) as a function of local electrode potential
(Φ) and (b) surface
charge vs potential drop Φ between −0.6 and 0.6 eV for
the triple-S-doped graphene with model-d and with different S concentrations,
including 4.2, 6, 9.4, and 16.7%. The results are obtained with the
supercells including 6 × 6, 5 × 5, 4 × 4, and 3 ×
3.

For the N/S, N/P, and P/S co-doping,
the CQ and surface charge density vs the
potential drop in the range
of −0.6 to +0.6 V are shown in Figure 6. For the N/S co-doping system, it is obvious
that the CQ value is higher than that
of graphene doped with N alone because the introduced S heteroatom
forms new hybrid states near Fermi level. Following the change of
N/S ratio based on the NS-doping, the maximum of CQ increases from 44.9 μF/cm2 at −0.024
V to 83.3 μF/cm2 at 0.13 V for the NNS-doping and
67.1 μF/cm2 at −0.29 V for the NSS-doping.
From the observation of LDOS and band structure (Figures S6 and S10 in the Supporting Information), this can
be attributed to the quasi-localized states near Fermi level induced
by the doped N and S. For the NS-doping, the surface charge density
is obviously larger than that of pristine graphene in Figure 6b. For the NSS-doping, the
surface charge density under negative bias is increased, compared
to that of NS-doping, while the surface charge density of NNS-doping
is increased under positive bias. In the band structures of the N/S
co-doped systems, N atom doping shifts the Fermi level to the valence
band, whereas S atom co-doping shifts the Fermi level to the conduction
band and forms a new electrode state near the Fermi level. By analyzing
the geometrical structures of the NSS-doping and NNS-doping (Table S1), the C–S–C angle is larger
than that of the NS-doping, but less than 120°. The C–N
bond length is shorter than the C–S bond length. This indicates
that the connection between N and C atoms is more firm.

Figure 6 (a, c, e) Calculated
quantum capacitance (CQ) as a function
of local electrode potential (Φ) and
(b, d, f) surface charge vs potential drop and Φ between −0.6
and 0.6 eV for the N/S co-doping, N/P co-doping, and P/S co-doping
with model-e, model-f, and model-g. The quantum capacitance and surface
charge vs potential drop of pristine graphene are shown as a reference.
The results are obtained with the supercells of 4 × 4.

For the N/P co-doping, the results are shown in Figure 6c,d. For the NP-doping,
no
quasi-localized states are found near the Dirac point. The U-shaped CQ–V curve is formed,
and the CQ value is much small around
0 V. Its CQ–V curve
is mostly coincident with pristine graphene around zero bias voltage,
and the CQ value enhances along with the
located electrode potential in the ranges of 0 −–0.6
V and 0–+0.6 V. When another N or P atom is embedded into the
NP co-doped graphene, from the observation of LDOS (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information), quasi-localized
states near Fermi level are induced by the doped N and P atoms. The CQ value of NNP- and NPP-doped graphene in Figure 6c shows maximum values
of 75.3 and 93.5 μF/cm2 at −0.19 and −0.32
V, respectively. For both NPP-doping and NNP-doping, the surface charge
density is found to obviously increase under negative bias.

For the P/S co-doping with different ratios, including 1:1 (PS-doping),
1:2 (PSS-doping), and 2:1 (SSP doping), CQ and surface charge density vs the potential drop in the range of
−0.6–+0.6 V are shown in Figure 6e,f. For the P/S co-doping system, it is
obvious that the CQ value is higher than
that of graphene. Following the increase of P or S based on the PS-doping,
the maximum of CQ decreases from 63.3
μF/cm2 at −0.14 V to 51.1 μF/cm2 at 0.31 V for the PPS-doping and to 62.6 μF/cm2 at −0.24 V for the PSS-doping. The curve of surface
charge density of PSS-doping is similar to that of PS-doping. For
the PPS-doping, the surface charge density increases under positive
bias and decreases under negative bias compared to PS-doping. This
is attributed to the fact that both the PS-doping and PSS-doping result
in the n-type doping and the PPS-doping induces the
shift-down of Fermi level, besides the local density of states near
Fermi level (Figure S8 in the Supporting
Information).

The triple-N-doped graphene obtains the maximum CQ value (118.4 μF/cm2) at 0.21
V, which
is greatly increased compared to that of the N/S, N/P, P/S co-doped
graphene and other investigated systems, as shown in Figure 7. It can be attributed to the
localized/nonlocalized states near Fermi level due to the introduction
of 3N+ vacancy complex. It is indicated that at low/high doping concentration,
such as 2/31 and 3/31 (double-N, triple-N-doped graphene with single
vacancy) where the number of heteroatoms is divided by the total number
of atoms, substituting one N atom with S could change the electronic
states and reduce the quantum capacitance slightly. The maximum CQ of the triple-N-doped graphene is larger than
that of the NPP and NNP-doping. Especially, at low N doping concentration,
such as 2/31, replacing one nitrogen atom with P could vary the electronic
states and reduce the quantum capacitance seriously. The NP-doping
has a detrimental effect on quantum capacitance. This behavior is
attributed to the suppression of states near Fermi level by co-doping
N into single P-doped graphene with single vacancy. At a higher doping
concentration, such as 3/31, replacing one N atom with P reduces the
quantum capacitance slightly. Based on these results, NNP- and NPP-doped
graphene is recommended as cathode material for asymmetric supercapacitors.
On the contrary, for the triple-N, S doping, it could be a promising
candidate as an electrode material for symmetric supercapacitors.

Figure 7 Change
trend chart of the maximum value of CQ for the B(N, P, S)-doped graphene with different doping models
(model-a, model-b, model-c, and model-d) and the N/S, N/P-co-doped
graphene with different models (model-e, model-f, and model-g). The
results are obtained with the supercell 4 × 4.

In current experiments on the use of doped graphene as the
electrodes
of supercapacitors, the graphene-based materials have much vacancies
because graphene oxides are generally used as the precursor.43 Vacancies play a major role in the doping/co-doping
processes since vacancies can reduce the formation energies of doping
defects.47 For the doping, the dopants
would like to occupy the sites around vacancies to form the dopant
+ vacancy complex. Therefore, we focus on the effect of the dopant
+ vacancy complex (the models in Figure 1) on the CQ of
graphene. Due to the synergistic effect, the N/S and N/S co-doping
is found to be easier than the doping with single elements (Table S1). It is interesting that a large number
of experiments have been focused on the N/S and N/P co-doping.31−38

The CQ of pristine graphene is
small
due to the limited density of states around the Dirac point. From
the above analysis, we can find that all of the three ways, including
doping, co-doping, and vacancies, can enhance the CQ of pristine graphene to some extent. The enhancement
of CQ is ascribed to the increase of DOSs
near Fermi level. The single vacancy can induce the localized states
near Fermi level with the breaking of the Dirac point24 and thus enhance the CQ. The
single-atom doping (model-a in Figure 1a) can shift Fermi level to the energy region with
high density of states and thus enhance the CQ. The doping and co-doping with the models in Figure 1b–g can introduce the
dopant + vacancy complex to induce the localized states near Fermi
level or/and shift Fermi level and thus increase the DOSs near Fermi
level to enhance the CQ. The experimental
results can just give the total capacitance and does not separate
the CQ from the total capacitance.34−38 All of the experimental results indicate the total capacitance is
enhanced by the doping or/and co-doping. From the previous research,14 the small CQ of
graphene limits mainly the enhancement of total capacitance of graphene-based
materials. It can be deduced that the enhancement of quantum capacitance
has a major contribution to the increase of total capacitance. Therefore,
the formation of dopant + vacancy complex is an important factor for
the high total capacitance observed in experiments due to the co-doping,
such as N/P and N/S.

Here, we also analyze theoretically the
total capacitances (CT) of N-doped graphene
(model-d) and pristine
graphene as the electrodes. The total interfacial capacitances can
be represented as a series of CQ and CD. CD is obtained
from classical molecular dynamics simulation for the 1 M NaCl aqueous
electrolyte.23 With the CQ and CD values calculated
above, we estimate CT as a function of
applied potential ϕ, as shown in Figure S11. The CT curve of pristine graphene
is U-shaped. From the CT curve of nitrogen-doped
graphene, the CT is obviously improved.
Under small potential drop, the CT from
pristine graphene is about 40 F/g and that of nitrogen-doped graphene
is about 140 F/g. These are consistent with the previous experimental
results about N-doped graphene.11

4 Conclusions
The effects of doping (B, N, P, S) and
co-doping (N/S, N/P, P/S)
on the structural parameters, electronic properties, and quantum capacitance
of graphene have been investigated systematically with first-principles
methods. Based on the calculated results, it is clearly shown that
the quantum capacitance of graphene can be increased prominently by
the doping. These modulations significantly change the band structure
by introducing localized states near Dirac point and/or Fermi-level
shifts. The localized states formed near Fermi level are found to
enhance the quantum capacitance of pristine graphene. Among these
doping models, the triple N- and S-doping with single vacancy is the
best candidate among the investigated structures for the EDLCs’
electrode. With the increase of doping concentrations, such as triple-S
doping with single vacancy, the quantum capacitance increases monotonically.
The investigation also provides a deeper understanding of N/S, N/P,
and P/S co-doped graphene, and a potential and effective method to
enhance quantum capacitance is proposed by controlling configuration
and the ratio of N/S, N/P, and P/S, which can serve as asymmetric
supercapacitor electrodes. For N/S co-doping, N and S atoms have opposite
effects on the electronic structure; when N or S is embedded, Fermi
levels move to valence band or conduction band, respectively. The
new electronic density of states near the Fermi level were introduced
when S was embedded into pyridinic-N-doped graphene, which causes
the increase of maximum quantum capacitance of co-doped graphene to
nearly 50%. Among all of these doping types, including the co-doping,
the triple N doping with single vacancy is found to afford the largest
quantum capacitance.
