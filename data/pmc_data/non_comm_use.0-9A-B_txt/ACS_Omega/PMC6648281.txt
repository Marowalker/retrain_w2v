Fog
formation on transparent surfaces constitutes a major challenge
in several optical applications, such as plastic packaging, lenses,
mirrors, and windshields. To overcome this problem, we prepared and
characterized durable antifog thin coatings on plastic films such
as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Proteinoids are biocompatible
random polymers made of α-amino acids by thermal step-growth
polymerization. Proteinoid prepolymers were prepared by adding activated
double bonds to proteinoids via the Michael addition reaction. A series
of thin antifog cross-linked coatings were prepared by spreading on
PET films with a Mayer rod various mixtures of the proteinoid prepolymers,
polyethylene glycol diacrylate, and a photoinitiator, followed by
UV-curing of the dried coatings. The antifog properties of the coatings
were determined by the contact angle, roughness, haze, and gloss measurements,
as well as hot and cold fog tests, to examine the optical properties
of the films under fog formation conditions. Mechanical properties
such as adhesion, robustness, and abrasion resistance of the antifog
coatings were examined by tape, knife-scratch, and sandpaper abrasion
tests. The effect of coating composition, wettability, and roughness
on the antifog properties of the coated PET films was elucidated.
The formula was optimized, and the corresponding UV-cured antifog
cross-linked thin coating exhibited transparency with good adhesion
and excellent durable antifog performance.

1 Introduction
In
certain conditions of temperature and humidity, fog can be created.
Fog is an accumulation of small droplets of water that condense on
solid surfaces such as plastic films, lenses, mirrors, and windshields.
The small droplets on the surface scatter light and reduce light transmission,
hence damaging the transparency of the product surface.1,2 This may cause significant damage in many fields: in food packaging,
the esthetics of the package are compromised, and the quality of the
food may decrease to the point where it can no longer be sold because
of the accumulated moisture; in agricultural films, fog droplets reduce
light transmission, inhibit growth of crops, and harm plant top leaves.1,3 One way to avoid fog formation is to control the temperature and
humidity of the environment.1 Another approach
is to use antifog coatings,1,2,4 which are preferable because of lower cost and energy consumption.
Antifog coatings can be external, where the antifog is applied using
spray or dip coating on the surface, or internal, where the antifog
is incorporated by compounding.3 Such coatings
prevent water condensation, maintain optical clarity, and increase
the surface energy of the films, causing water droplets to rapidly
spread into a uniformly thin and non-light-scattering film. In this
case, although condensation still occurs, the surface remains optically
clear, without disruption of light transfer.1−6 In the past three decades, the common method to obtain antifog properties
was by hydrophilic coatings with polymers that contain hydrophilic
functionalities, such as hydroxyl (OH), carboxylic (COOH), and amine
(NH2) groups.1 For example,
coatings were prepared with poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol),
or acrylic resin with pending OH or COOH groups and glycidyl derivatives.4 Comparisons with main recent previously reported
materials, systems, and substrates are shown in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The table indicates that
the most common substrate used for thin functional coating is glass,
as opposed to plastic used in the present study. This is due to the
relative ease with which different reagents can react with the surface
hydroxyl groups of glass. The use of proteinoid prepolymers for antifog
coatings is also new.

Recently, we reported on novel antifog
coatings applied to polypropylene
films, prepared from a mixture of A131-X, a typical adhesive aqueous
solution of polyethyleneimine, and proteinoid polymers or particles.5 However, these antifog coatings were not durable,
as shown by different mechanical tests including immersion in water,
adhesion tests, and rub resistance tests, after which they were not
stable and showed poor antifog properties. In contrast, the present
manuscript describes the formation of a simple durable antifog thin
coating on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films.

Water-wetting
properties (e.g., low water contact angle) are affected
by the surface roughness and/or chemical composition. Rough surfaces
cause fog to accumulate in craters on the surface, which contain water
droplets.1,7 In addition, the chemical composition of
the substrate surface is important for designing optimal antifog coatings.
Low water contact angles on surfaces with appropriate roughness and
chemical composition usually yield good antifog films.1,7 However, in spite of great efforts, preparation of optical quality
thin-film coatings with good antifog characteristics and mechanical
durability remains a great challenge.1

In the present study, a new durable thin cross-linked antifog coating
on PET films was designed, based on the assumption that a cross-linked
polymeric network is essential in order to maintain long-term antifog
properties and enhance coating resistance.8 For this purpose, a series of thin cross-linked coatings were prepared
by spreading various mixtures of proteinoid prepolymers, polyethylene
glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), and a photoinitiator with a Mayer rod on
corona-treated PET films, followed by UV-curing of the dried coatings
to generate a cross-linked network of polymers by initiating a photochemical
reaction. UV-curing is a rapid technology applicable to virtually
any substrate, including plastic, metal, composite, wood, paper, leather,
glass, magnetic recording tape, and even human teeth.9,10 Proteinoids are polymers made from natural amino acids by thermal
bulk step-growth polymerization; they are nontoxic and non-immunogenic
and therefore potential candidates for a variety of applications such
as specific cell labeling, drug delivery, and diagnosis of diseases.5,11−14 For the present study, the proteinoids were synthesized using glutamic
acid or lysine as solvents for the random polymerization process.
These amino acids consist of carboxylic and amine hydrophilic functional
groups, thereby the antifog properties are ascribed to the proteinoid.
To obtain good mechanical and surface compatibility properties, phenylalanine
and isoleucine were added to the proteinoid backbone. Furthermore,
in this study, proteinoid prepolymers with activated double bonds
were prepared by Michael addition of acidic or basic proteinoids with
excess PEGDA. The activated prepolymers were then UV-cured with PEGDA
to achieve optimal thin coatings that exhibit durable antifog properties.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Proteinoids
and Proteinoid Prepolymers
Proteinoids were prepared by thermal
step-growth polymerization of different amino acids and characterized
for their molecular weights and polydispersity, as shown in Table 1. The synthesized
proteinoids were of relatively high molecular weight with relatively
narrow polydispersity index (PDI)—36 kDa and 1.02 PDI, 68 kDa,
and 1.04 PDI, and 95 kDa and 1.09 PDI for poly(KI), poly(EI), and
poly(KF), respectively. This indicates that the simple thermal step-growth
polymerization procedure used here provides relatively long polymer
chains with narrow PDI, as reported in previous studies by our group.5,11−14,19 Furthermore, Table 1 shows that all proteinoids
exhibit optical activity, although the monomers are known to racemize
during the thermal process.20

Proteinoids and proteinoid prepolymers were characterized
by Fourier
transform infra-red (FTIR). Typical spectra are illustrated in Figure 1, panels A and C,
respectively. Figure 1B illustrates the spectrum of PEGDA. All proteinoids spectra (Figures 4A, S1A and S2A) show characteristic peaks of NH stretching at
3300 and 2930 cm–l, amide CO stretching at 1514–1579
cm–1, amide NH bending band at 1449 cm–1, and CO bending at 500–700 cm–1. The PEGDA
spectrum shows characteristic peaks of C=C stretching at 1640
cm–1, carbonyl groups at 1724 cm–1, and C–O–C stretching at 1110 cm–1. All proteinoid prepolymers showed a combination of the characteristic
peaks of both proteinoid and PEGDA monomers. Hence, it can be assumed
that the preparation of proteinoid prepolymers (Figures 1C, S1B and S2B) via the Michael addition reaction indeed was successful.

2.1.1 NMR Analysis of Amino Acid Composition
For a quantitative view of the relative incorporation rates of
amino acids into the proteinoids, we employed 1H NMR spectroscopy.
The analysis is based on the strictly quantitative nature of the spectrum—the
signal is directly proportional to the number of nuclei of a certain
type—and on the fact that amino acid side-chains have sufficiently
unique NMR footprints to afford in most cases unambiguous assignment
of the observed signals. Proteinoids were dissolved in neat 2H2O at a concentration of 10 mg/mL, and 1D 1H spectra were acquired with presaturation of the residual HDO peak.
Results for the poly(KF) proteinoid are shown in Figure 2 and are representative of
all measurements; results for the poly(KI) and poly(EI) proteinoids
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S3 and S4). Comparison of the spectra to characteristic
average chemical shifts reveals that in the aliphatic proteinoids
the vast majority of the signal (98–99%) appears in the expected
frequency ranges. In contrast, the poly(KF) spectrum exhibited a small
amount (5%) of up-field shifts that are consistent with ring-current
effects. In both cases, the spectra were divided into regions in which
the spin assignment was clear, and signals and integrated intensities
were assigned to amino acids. Molar ratios were calculated within
the proteinoids, as well as relative incorporation rates for each
pair of residues based on the known initial ratios of amino acids
(see Table 2).

a Sig-1 and Sig-2

signals from the first and second amino acid, respectively.

b Nuc-1 and Nuc-2 are the nuclei contributing
to the signals in the designated spectral regions.

c Mol/mol ratio is calculated by dividing
Sig-ratio by the ratio between the number of protons that contribute
to the signals of the solvent (K/E) and the other amino acid (F/I).

d Because of overlap in the 1.2–2.0
(1.8–2.5) ppm region between the K/I (E/I) frequencies, the
relative contribution of each amino acid was deduced from the signal
in the Ile methyl spectral region and stoichiometry.

As all proteinoids were prepared
from a 1:1 wt/wt mixture of the
two amino acids, we could deduce that the relative incorporation rates
were 1.80:1.00 for Lys/Phe, 1.35:1.00 for Lys/Ile, and 1.35:1.00 for
Glu/Ile. These findings indicate that the amino acid liquefied into
a solvent at the reaction temperature (Lys/Glu) is incorporated in
excess, the extent of which is correlated with the relative bulkiness
of the two amino acids.

2.1.2 NMR Analysis of Proteinoid
Prepolymers
Proteinoid prepolymers were analyzed by NMR to
observe the incorporation
of the cross-linking diacrylate moiety. A comparison of 1D 1H NMR spectra before and after coupling to PEGDA is shown in Figure 3 for the poly(EI)
proteinoid. While the ratio of Glu-to-Ile peaks appears to be similar
in both cases, the spectrum shows clearly the addition of protons
signals expected for polyPEGDA. The 6.0–6.4 ppm region exhibits
signals with chemical shifts and J-couplings typical
of an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety present in the acrylate
group before Michael addition. Peaks typical of the ethylene glycol
moiety and α-protons of an ester group can also be observed.
Taken together, these observations are consistent with addition of
PEGDA groups to the proteinoid.

signals are indicated.

spectra of PET films, uncoated and coated with PEDGA (PET/PEGDA) before
and after UV-curing are shown in Figure 4.

and ring C–H out-of-plane bending.21,22

Figure 4B,E
and 4C,F exhibits spectra with PEGDA coating
before and
after UV-curing, respectively. Figure 4B exhibits main absorption bands at 1620, 1636–1647,
and 810 cm–1 of C=C stretching of terminal
acrylate group. These peaks were not observed after UV-curing (Figure 4C), showing that
all double bonds of the PEGDA monomer reacted during the polymerization
process.23 Other prominent peaks were observed
at 1731 cm–1 of C=O stretching, 2885–2287
cm–1 of C–H stretching, 1351–1352
cm–1 of C–O asymmetric bending, 1243–1283
cm–1 of C–O asymmetric bending, and 1107–1194
cm–1 of C–O–C symmetric stretching.

2.2.2 Atomic Force Microscopy
PET films
were coated by solutions of PEGDA (5, 10, 15, and 20% w/v) or PEGDA
and proteinoid prepolymer, followed by UV-curing of the dried coatings,
as described in the experimental part. Table 3 and Figure 5 illustrate the measured surface roughness and water
contact angles of the uncoated and coated films. Roughness measurements
clearly show that coating by polyPEGDA improve the smoothness of the
film. Corona-treated PET films showed high roughness of 3.6 nm because
of collisions of oxygen and nitrogen ions with the film, creating
pores in the surface. Coating the films with polymers with increasing
concentrations of PEGDA systematically reduced the roughness, for
example, the roughness decreased to 2.3 and 0.4 nm in polymers made
of 5 and 20% PEGDA, respectively, as shown in Table 3. Corona-treated PET films coated with polymers
comprising proteinoid prepolymers-PEGDA mixtures display different
surface roughness, depending on the type of proteinoid used. Coatings
made of poly(KI-PEGDA) or poly(EI-PEGDA) yielded high surface roughness,
mostly surpassing uncoated PET films. On the other hand, PET films
coated with poly(KF-PEGDA) displayed lower roughness than uncoated
films, in the range of 0.2–1.1 nm. This may be explained by
the significance of incorporating phenylalanine in the proteinoid
backbone, which improves the hydrophobic interaction between poly(KF-PEGDA)
and the PET film surface. The similarity in the chemical structure
between the phenylalanine group and PET film (aromatic rings) led
to improved compatibility, compared with the isoleucine side chain
in poly(EI-PEGDA) and poly(KI-PEGDA).

of three measurements at three different areas of the film.

2.2.3 Contact
Angle
The water contact
angles of the film surfaces, shown in Table 3, clearly indicate that all polymeric coatings
led to a decrease in the contact angle, compared with the uncoated
corona-treated PET films. The reduced contact angle yields a range
of required values for antifog properties. Low contact angles indicate
a high hydrophilic character of the coated films, hence achieving
good water-wetting surface properties. Corona-treated PET films possess
a water contact angle of 69°, while coatings with PEGDA polymer
alone reduced the contact angle to 28.3–33.6°, and coating
with proteinoid prepolymer–PEGDA polymer mixtures reduced the
contact angle further to very low values, down to 5.6°. Table 3 also demonstrates
that increasing the concentration of PEGDA polymers from 5 to 20%
does not affect or decreases the contact angle only slightly. For
example, coatings made of 5 and 20% poly(KF-PEGDA) display water contact
angles of 22.7 ± 0.4 and 25.4 ± 2.2°, respectively,
while coatings made of 5 and 20% poly(EI-PEGDA) attain contact angles
of 10.9 ± 2.6 and 5.6 ± 1.4°, respectively. As mentioned
above, to achieve a good antifog coating, reaching low contact angle
is important. Surfaces which exhibit water contact angles of less
than 40° are often considered as candidates for being antifog
coatings.3 The lowest water contact angles
were achieved by poly(KI-PEGDA) and poly(EI-PEGDA) as shown in Table 3. Figure 6 illustrates the visual difference
in the contact angle between uncoated PET films and PET films coated
with proteinoid prepolymer–PEGDA polymer mixtures. As seen,
the water spreads into a continuous and uniform layer only on the
coatings made from proteinoid–PEGDA (C–E) with contact
angle in the range of 8.5–20.7°. Nevertheless, on uncoated
corona-treated PET films, the water formed ball-shaped droplets on
the surface (A) with contact angle of 69.3°. The coating changes
the interfacial tension between the water and the PET surface and
enables strong connectivity between the film and water droplets.

the films were placed over a written paper and the optical properties
were observed (panels B and D). “Photograph courtesy of “Elisheva
Sason”. Copyright 2019.”

Table 3 indicates
that the relationship between roughness and contact angle is also
dependent on the composition of the coatings. For example, it is difficult
to understand why increasing the roughness of the poly(EI-PEGDA) coatings
leads to a decrease in the contact angle, while increasing the roughness
of the poly(KI-PEGDA) coatings has little effect on the contact angle.
These results should be further investigated.

2.2.4 Optical Activity
The haze, gloss,
and light transmission of UV-cured coated and uncoated PET films are
shown in Table 4. PET
films coated by polymers made of 5–20% PEGDA exhibit similar
values of haze and transmission as uncoated PET film, in the range
of 7.6–8.2 and 91.0–92.1, respectively. On the other
hand, the gloss reduced slightly from 150 to the range of 120–130. Table 4 also illustrates
that in the coatings with proteinoid prepolymers–PEGDA polymer
mixtures, the haze values of the films with poly(KI-PEGDA) and poly(EI-PEGDA)
increased, while that of the poly(KF-PEGDA)-coated film remained unchanged,
the gloss values decreased, and the transmission remained unchanged
relative to the uncoated PET film. It is possible that the increase
in haze of the poly(KI-PEGDA) and poly(EI-PEGDA) coatings is due to
the relatively low compatibility of the proteinoids with the PET film.
On the other hand, poly(KF-PEGDA) coatings exhibit low values of haze,
similar to uncoated PET, because of the better compatibility with
PET discussed above.

2.2.5 Fog
Test
The coated films were
subjected to hot and cold fog tests, as described in the Experimental Section. All results were obtained
during 1 day of heating in 60 °C or cooling in 4 °C, as
shown in Table 5 and Figure 6. Figure 9 shows the range of optical
visibility through the PET films, ranked A–D, where A denotes
excellent visibility, while D denotes poor visibility. Uncoated corona-treated
PET films show poor visibility even after 1 day (see Table 5 and Figure 6A,B). Coating the films with polymers made
of PEGDA at different concentrations (5–20%) did not significantly
improve the visibility observed during the first few hours in the
cold tests, while in the hot tests there was improvement with increasing
PEGDA concentration. For instance, after 3 h, the visibility in the
hot fog test improved from D to C, B, and A/B for coatings with 5,
10, and 15% PEGDA. Thus, higher PEG percentage in the coating produces
faster improvement in visibility, which is reasonable, as PEG increases
the water-wetting properties of the coatings. Still, Table 5 illustrates that coating PET
films with high percentage of poly(PEGDA) is not sufficient for obtaining
good antifog coatings.

to corona-treated
PET films coated with polymers made of 5–20% PEGDA or proteinoid
prepolymer–PEGDA mixtures, as specified.

Significant improvement in optical
visibility was observed when
the PET films were coated with polymers made of proteinoid prepolymers–PEGDA
mixtures, as shown in Table 5. For coatings composed of poly(EI-PEGDA 5–20%), the
visibility rank after 5 min and throughout the day was A in the cold
test, while in the hot test higher PEG content yielded better optical
visibility, for example, after 3 h, B/C and A were obtained with EI
and 5 and 10% PEGDA, respectively, while coatings with 15 or 20% PEGDA
attained a visibility rank of A after 5 min that persisted throughout
the day. Table 5 also
illustrates the importance of the proteinoid composition of the coatings;
substituting isoleucine for phenylalanine deteriorates quite significantly
the antifog properties. The source of this behavior is still not clear
to us. While in both tests, poly(KI-PEGDA 10–20%) coatings
rapidly attained excellent visibility, poly(KF-PEGDA 5–20%)
attained optical visibility of A only after a day, while in the hot
test poly(KF-PEGDA 5–10%) only reached visibility of B even
after 1 day.

Figure 6 illustrates
the visual differences in optical properties between the uncoated
corona-treated PET films (panels A and B) and corona-treated PET films
coated with polymers made of poly(KI-PEGDA 10%) (panels C and D).
In panels A and C, the films were placed over a beaker filled with
water and kept at 60 °C. As illustrated in Figure 6C, the water spread into a continuous and
uniform layer only on the poly(KI-PEGDA 10%)-coated film, obtaining
a ranking of A. On the other hand, on the uncoated corona-treated
PET films (Figure 6A), the water formed tiny droplets on the surface that damaged the
clarity of the PET film, obtaining a poor ranking of D. Immediately
after heating, the films were placed over a written paper, and the
optical properties were observed (Figure 6, panels B and D). It is clear that the writing
observed through the film coated with poly(KI-PEGDA 10%) is completely
clear, while the writing covered by the uncoated film is obscure.

2.2.6 Durability of the Coatings
The
stability of the coatings was examined, as mentioned in the Methods section. All samples exhibited similar
results following 20 cycles of the hot fog test. Furthermore, similar
results were obtained following the overnight soaking test in water
after the first cycle and then drying in an oven at 80 °C. Hence,
the coatings are stable and durable in water, and the antifog properties
are preserved for a relatively long term.

2.2.6.1 Mechanical
Properties of Coatings
As mention in the Materials and Experimental Section, tape, knife-scratch, and sandpaper
abrasion tests were performed on the coated films after which the
films were introduced to the hot fog test. All coatings exhibited
the same antifog properties as shown before the tests (as shown in Table 5), indicating that
the coatings are resistant to different types of mechanical abrasions
while maintaining their antifog properties.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Materials
The
following analytical-grade
chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used without
further purification: l-glutamic acid, l-phenylalanine, l-isoleucine, and l-lysine from Sigma (Rehovot, Israel);
PEGDA 400 Da from Polysciences (Germany); bisacylphosphine oxide—a
photoinitiator named IRGACURE 819-DW, from BASF (Germany); PET films
(air corona-treated) of A4 size and 36 μm average thickness
from Hanita Coatings Ltd. (Israel); and tape from 3M (USA). Water
was purified by passing deionized water through an Elgastat Spectrum
reverse osmosis system (Elga Ltd., High Wycombe, UK).

3.2 Methods
3.2.1 Preparation of Proteinoids
by Thermal Step-Growth
Polymerization
A selection of l-amino acids was
used to prepare a series of proteinoids: l-glutamic acid, l-phenylalanine, l-lysine, and l-isoleucine
in different weight ratios to give a total monomer weight of 5 g.
Each mixture of amino acids was heated in a mantle to 180 °C
under nitrogen. The mixture was kept at 180 °C and mechanically
stirred at 150 rpm for 45 min to yield a brown glassy mass. Upon cooling
to room temperature, water (15 mL) were added to the crude product,
and the mixture was stirred overnight. Thereafter, the water-soluble
proteinoid polymer was separated from the insoluble cross-linked part
(about 15–17% for all proteinoids). The water-soluble polymers
were washed of excess reagents by extensive dialysis cycles (500–1000
Da MWCO) with distilled water. The contents of the dialysis tube were
then lyophilized to obtain a yellow-white proteinoid powder with yield
of 77–83% for all proteinoids.5,11−14

The following proteinoids were prepared: poly(KI) with 1:1
w/w lysine/isoleucine, poly(KF) with 1:1 w/w lysine/phenylalanine,
and poly(EI) with 1:1 w/w glutamic acid/isoleucine.

3.2.2 Preparation of Proteinoid Prepolymers
Proteinoid prepolymers
were prepared via Michael addition reaction,
by interacting free primary amino groups of the proteinoids with double
bonds belonging to the cross-linker monomer PEGDA, as shown in Figure 7. Briefly, crude
proteinoids were dissolved in water (100 mg in 1 mL), and the pH was
adjusted to 8–9 in the acidic poly(EI) proteinoid solution
by adding NaOH (1 M, 400 μL). PEGDA (10% w/w, 10 mg in 0.2 mL
ethanol) was added to the proteinoid aqueous solution, and the mixture
was heated to 50 °C and stirred for 120 min to yield the proteinoid
prepolymers.

Figure 7 Michael addition reaction of proteinoid with PEGDA 400.

3.2.3 Characterization
of Proteinoids and Prepolymers
The molecular weights and
polydispersity indices of the proteinoids
were determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) comprising
a Waters Spectra Series P100 isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) pump with an ERMA ERC-7510 refractive index detector and a
Rheodyne (Coatati, CA, USA) injection valve with a 20 μL loop
(Waters, MA, USA). The samples were eluted with superpure HPLC water
through a linear BioSep SEC-s-3000 column (Phenomenex) at a flow rate
of 1 mL/min. The molecular weights were determined relative to poly(ethylene
glycol) standards (Polymer Standards Service-USA, Silver Spring, MD,
USA) with a molecular weight range of 100–450 000 Da, human
serum albumin (67 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich), and bovine plasma fibrinogen
(340 kDa, Sigma-Aldrich), using Clarity Chromatography software (DataApex,
Prague, Czech Republic).

The optical activities of the formed
proteinoids were determined using a PE343 polarimeter (PerkinElmer).
The measurements were done in water, at 589 nm and 25 °C.

FTIR measurements of the crude proteinoids and prepolymers were
done by the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) technique, using a
Bruker ALPHA-FTIR QuickSnap sampling module equipped with a Platinum
ATR diamond module.

1H NMR characterization of proteinoids
and prepolymers
was performed on a Bruker DRX700 spectrometer using a cryogenic TCI
probehead equipped with z-axis pulsed field gradients.
Measurements were conducted at 300 K on 5–10 mg/mL proteinoid
samples in 2H2O using a 1D-1H NMR
sequence with presaturation of the residual water signal. Typical
total measurement times were 30–60 s per sample. Spectra were
processed and analyzed using the Bruker TopSpin 3.5 platform.

3.2.4 Preparation of Antifog Thin Coatings
Thin antifog coatings
on PET films were prepared by spreading with
a Mayer rod (Figure 2B) various mixtures containing the selected proteinoid prepolymer,
photoinitiator, and different concentrations of PEGDA, followed by
UV-curing of the dried mixtures. Briefly, in the first step, to improve
the adhesion of the coating on the plastic, PET films were pretreated
by corona with iCorona-1 (VETAPHONE Corona & Plasma, Denmark)
at 300 W·min/m2. Then, 1 mL of mixtures containing
different concentrations of PEGDA (5, 10, 15, and 20% w/v) and 1%
(relative to the PEGDA) of the photo-initiator IRGACURE 819-DW (Figure 8A) were added to
a 1 mL aqueous solution containing 100 mg of the selected proteinoid
prepolymer. In the next step, the different mixtures were spread on
PET films by a Mayer rod (Figure 8B) with 6 μm thickness.5,15 Following
this process, the coating was dried in a heating oven at 80 °C
for a few minutes and cured by UV (testing model RW-UVA 201-20 with
220 V ac 50 Hz power supply) at speed of 35 m/min, under high-pressure
mercury UV lamp with 100 W/cm power and main wavelength of 365 nm
to achieve dried coated films.

setup for coating with Mayer rod on plastic films: the PET plastic
film was placed on a flat surface, and the rod was pulled over the
PEGDA solution with or without proteinoid prepolymer, leaving a uniform
layer with wet thickness of 6 μm. “Photograph courtesy

Similar coating was done with ethanol solutions
containing different
concentrations of PEGDA and photoinitiator without proteinoid prepolymer.

3.2.5 Characterization of Antifog Coatings
FTIR measurements were performed as described in Section 3.2.2 on uncoated and coated
PET films with PEGDA (20% w/v) before and after UV-curing.

Surface
topography analysis of the coated and uncoated PET films was obtained
using atomic force microscopy (AFM, NanoScope 9, Bio FastScan, Bruker
AXS, Santa Barbara, CA). All images were obtained in soft tapping
mode with a FastScan-B (Bruker) silicon probe. The images were captured
in the retrace direction with a scan rate of 1.4 Hz. Scans for each
film were performed on an area of 3 μm × 3 μm. Height
images were captured with 512 scans/line image resolution. AFM images
were obtained in air at room temperature. Before analysis of the images,
second-order “flatting” and first-order “planefit”
functions were applied to each image. Analysis of the height images
was done using the NanoScope Analysis software. The morphological
changes of the films were determined by averaging the root mean square
roughness (Rq) values over three different
regions on each film. The reported values are an average of at least
three different points of four different films.

Sessile drop
water contact angle measurements were done using a
Goniometer (System OCA, model OCA20, Data Physics Instruments GmbH,
Filderstadt, Germany). Drops of 5 μL of distilled water were
placed on five different areas of each film, and images were captured
a few seconds after deposition. The static water contact angle values
were determined by Laplace–Young curve fitting. All measurements
were done at 25 °C and 60% moisture. Each result represents an
average of four measurements with up to 5% standard deviation. Uncoated
PET was used as a reference.

Haze and transmission measurements
were performed using a Haze-Gard
Plus 4752 model with ASTM D1003 standard (BYK-Gardner, Germany). The
instrument was used to evaluate the degrading visibility of different
damage modes by measuring the haze level increase; the transparent
specimen was illuminated at normal incidence, and the transmitted
light was measured photoelectrically by an integrating sphere. Haze
is caused by wide-angle scattering. According to ASTM D1003, haze
is the percentage of transmitted light that deviates from the incident
beam by more than 2.58 on average. When total transmittance was measured,
the sphere’s normal outlet was closed, and when haze is measured,
the normal outlet was open. Increased haze of a transparent sample
reduces the contrast of an object viewed through the sample, resulting
in a milky or cloudy appearance of the object.16

Gloss measurements were performed using a Tri-Glossmaster
20 60–85°
model multiangle Glossmeter (SH260C, Sheen Instruments, USA).

Antifog behavior of the films was studied using hot and cold fog
tests.3−5,17 Briefly, an open 28
mL vial filled with 10 mL water was covered with a 5 cm × 5 cm
film and subsequently kept in a 60 °C water bath or at 4 °C
in a refrigerator. Variations in the optical visibility of the films
were observed and recorded at different time intervals. Ratings of
A to D were used, where D denotes zero visibility with an opaque layer
of small water droplets and A describes excellent optical visibility
where a transparent continuous film of water is displayed, as shown
in Figure 9.

Figure 9 Optical visibility ranking: (A) transparent continuous
layer of
water providing excellent optical performance; (B) large water drops
on some parts of the surface allowing partial light transmission;
(C) medium water drops on most of the surface allowing partial light
transmission; and (D) small water drops on the entire surface causing
very poor visibility. “Photograph courtesy of “Elisheva
Sason”. Copyright 2019.”

3.2.6 Durability of the Coatings
Coating
stability was evaluated by repeating the hot fog test 20 times. In
each cycle, the sample was cooled overnight to room temperature and
exposed to the test the next day. In addition, durability of the coatings
in water was tested after completion of the first cycle by soaking
the coated films in water overnight and drying in an oven at 80 °C
for a few minutes prior to the second cycle.

3.2.6.1 Mechanical
Properties of the Coatings
Adhesion tests were done to investigate
the strength of the interaction
between the coating and the substrate film. Each test was carried
out as follows: an adhesive tape was firmly pressed onto the coating
film and then slowly peeled off. The process was repeated 10 times
after which the tested film was introduced to the hot fog test to
insure that the antifog properties were not damaged (Figure S5).

Knife-scratch and sandpaper abrasion tests
were performed to evaluate the robustness and abrasive resistance
of the coatings. A knife was used to scratch the coatings along several
lines after which the tested film was introduced to the hot fog test
(Figure S6). The sandpaper abrasion test
was carried out as follows: a 35 g weight was placed on a ruler, and
the film was attached to the ruler, which was positioned on a sandpaper
with the coated side facing the sandpaper (Figure S7A). The ruler with the attached film was moved 10 cm along
the sandpaper five times (Figure S7B)18 after which the film was introduced to the hot
fog test.

4 Conclusions
In this
study, a series of thin antifog cross-linked coatings were
prepared by spreading on PET films with a Mayer rod various mixtures
of proteinoid prepolymers, PEGDA, and a photoinitiator, followed by
UV-curing of the dried coatings. The proteinoids, synthesized by thermal
bulk step-growth polymerization, were mostly uniform in size distribution
with relatively high molecular weights. The proteinoids were activated
by Michael addition with PEGDA to yield proteinoids with double bonds,
termed proteinoid prepolymers. Then, thin cross-linked coatings were
made on corona-treated PET films by UV-curing of mixtures of the proteinoid
prepolymers and different concentrations of PEGDA. The coated PET
films before and after UV-curing were characterized by FTIR, which
indicated full polymerization of the monomers during the UV-curing
process. The surface roughness and contact angles of the films were
characterized and showed hydrophilic coatings with static contact
angles in the range of 5.6–33.6° and surface roughness
in the range of 0.37–15.8 nm. The mechanical properties of
the coatings were examined by tape, knife-scratch, and sandpaper abrasion
tests. After the tests, the coatings kept their mechanical stability
and antifog properties. The effect of the proteinoid polymer composition
on the antifog properties of the coatings was also illustrated. For
example, coatings containing isoleucine illustrated significantly
better antifog properties than coatings of similar composition in
which isoleucine was substituted by phenylalanine. The optical characteristics
of the coatings were determined, with haze in the range of 7.4–20
and good rankings in hot and cold fog tests. This series of UV-curable
acrylate polymers containing proteinoids may potentially become useful
as antifog material for various devices and potentially also for biological
and food-related applications.
