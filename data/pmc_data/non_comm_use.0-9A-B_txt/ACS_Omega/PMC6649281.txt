Fluorescence
enhancement on aggregation for π-conjugates
linked with pyridyl ring has been established as a part of widely
studied smart organic functional materials. Therefore, the photophysical
features in the solution and aggregate states for such compounds remain
impressive. In this work, we synthesized three series of photostable
unsymmetrical aryl-substituted anthracenyl π-conjugates linked
to pyridyl ring with a variation of the position of a pyridyl-N atom
and examined the difference in the photophysical properties preferably
in the aggregate state. The so-called “aggregation-induced
emission (AIE)” behavior was discernible for the 2- and 4-pyridyl-
but not 3-pyridyl-10-p-tolyl or mesityl-substituted
π-conjugates. Curiously, a variation of the position of a pyridyl-N
atom does not solely control the AIE phenomenon for 10-thiophenyl-substituted
π-conjugates, where all of the isomers are found to be AIE-active.
Hence, the dissimilarity in emission behavior in the aggregate state
is governed by the position of N-atom for pyridine and also the substituent
at the 10th position of the anthracyl ring. The mechanistic insight
behind these observations is demonstrated by concentration-dependent
fluorescence studies, time-resolved fluorescence, single-crystal X-ray
diffraction studies (largely supportive to understand the molecular
structure and packing in the aggregate), and average particle size
measurement of the aggregates and partly by the density functional
theory studies for a few representative molecules.

Introduction
The evolution in the
discovery of organic small molecules as aggregation-induced
emission active luminogens (AIEgens) has been continuing and being
highlighted in many recent reviews.1 The
tremendous applications of such AIEgens in numerous fields, such as
optoelectronic materials, optical security, and fluorescence sensing,
have made a steady and common platform for researchers from interdisciplinary
areas.2 Among many such AIEgens, pyridyl-linked
extensive π-conjugates could acquire its place as promising
AIEgens in the literature.3,4 There are typical and
extensively reported AIEgens, such as tetraphenylethene (TPE), that
are linked to pyridyl rings and established as potential smart materials
and metal sensors.3a,3b The significant attractions of
pyridine core are mainly due to the freely available lone pair on
nitrogen residing at sp2 orbital and strong N···H
bonding in the aggregated state resulting many changes in the fluorescence
behavior under different external stimuli, such as acid/base, pressure,
and temperature.3,4 Apart from TPE, pyridine-linked
anthracenyl π-conjugates are well established as useful AIEgens,
as shown in Figure 1.4,5

Figure 1 Reported pyridyl π-conjugates A–C and
their applications.

The pyridyl π-conjugate A was blended with tyrosine
polymer to afford highly emissive polymeric material5a and was also used as a ligand to make complexes with solvatochromic
behavior along with significant photophysical studies.5b,5c Further, the symmetrical di-styrylanthracene compound (B) is quite well recognized as a valuable material, where the pyridyl
core played a crucial role6 for the various
applied field, as mentioned in Figure 1. Further, our literature search resulted in the molecule
of type C that was reported as a patent related to the
light-emitting device.7 Notably, the electron-donating
substitution (such as −methyl) at the 10th position of the
anthracyl ring for A had the advantageous effect for
the charge transfer.5d However, the AIE
studies were not investigated for such aryl-substituted A. In spite of many disputes, the restricted intramolecular motion
in the aggregate state is well established and documented as the main
cause of the AIE effect by Prof. Tang and others.8,1c Thus,
the influence of large twisting on the system would be beneficial
to restrict the intramolecular motion to impose enhanced emission.
With this clue, we were earlier successful to generate distinct anthracenyl
π-conjugates9 as new AIEgens, including
these two pyridyl analogues ATh4P and AT4P(9b) (Figure 2), where AT4P was established as multiple
metal-ion sensors.9c Meanwhile, the literature
reports on the substitution10 and regioisomeric
effect11 on the AIE behavior due to different
molecular packing in the aggregate state and electronic structure
prompted us to synthesize a variety of regioisomeric pyridyl compounds
(Figure 2) and explore
their photophysical behaviors in both solution and aggregate states.

Figure 2 Pyridyl
π-conjugates linked to substituted anthracenyl skeleton.

More importantly, a precise change
in the position of pyridyl nitrogen
atom by keeping the other part intact was expected to exert a substantial
effect on the molecular conformation, crystal packing, electronic
structure, and subsequently the optical properties. Thus, such molecules
with the same molecular formulae can display different photophysical
behavior just because of the different conformational flexibility
within the molecule.10 At present, we focus
on generating and studying the AIE properties for three series of
regioisomeric pyridyl π-conjugates that are linked with (hetero)aryl-substituted
anthracene (Figure 2). The subtle change in the position of nitrogen for the pyridyl
ring resulted in different absorption and emission behaviors on aggregation.
In fact, the substitution effect at the 10th position of anthracenyl
ring was also found to be exciting. The tolyl- and mesityl-substituted
π-conjugates are AIE-active except 3-pyridyl isomers AT3P and AM3P that favor aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ)
behavior. Surprisingly, all thiophenyl-substituted pyridyl isomers
including ATh3P are recognized as relatively better AIEgen
under similar conditions. Such interesting features need explanation.
To understand the observed photophysical behaviors, the molecular
structures were determined for selected molecules by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction studies to find the supramolecular interactions
in the aggregates. The observed facts are explained through the concentration-dependent
Fl. studies, measurement of excited-state lifetime, and aggregate
particle size along with the electronic structure of selected molecules.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis of the Molecules
These
compounds were designed
based on our earlier observations,9b and
particularly, the thiophene substitution made the system unique as
AIEgen. All of these compounds were synthesized in high yields via
simple but efficient Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reactions
of phosphonates with the corresponding aldehydes in the presence of
NaH or KOtBu (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Anthracene-Based π-Conjugates
Linked to Regioisomeric
Pyridine
All of the compounds
were characterized using multinuclear NMR
and mass spectroscopy. The trans-coupling was observed for some of
these compounds; however, the molecular structures for few compounds
were determined unequivocally by single-crystal X-ray diffraction
studies. Initially, KOtBu was preferred
as a base compared to NaH (60% dispersed in mineral oil) due to the
operational simplicity and easy purification process. All of these
π-conjugates were synthesized using KOtBu except ATh2P as it could not be synthesized
using KOtBu/tetrahydrofuran (THF) unexpectedly
even after repetitive attempts. Instead, the reduced compound ATh2PR was obtained in 75% yield every time (Scheme 2). Nevertheless, ATh2P was prepared in 72% yield using NaH. The compound with the presence
of two CH2’s was identified by 1H NMR
and finally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (Scheme 2; right). Such reactions
could be possible with KOtBu/THF due to
the unusual effect in organic synthesis.12

Scheme 2 Formation of Compound ATh2PR and Its Molecular Structure
However, such a compound is
considered to be an analogue of C, as mentioned earlier
(Figure 1). Due to
the loss of conjugation with pyridyl
ring and being quite different from our focus, we withhold ATh2PR for AIE studies. All of these π-conjugates are soluble in
most of the water-miscible solvents and significantly stable under
photoexcitation in both the solution and solid states, whereas the
photostability was an issue for the previously reported system with
similar properties, in which two 9-vinylanthracene parts are attached
to only 1,2-positions of the benzene ring.10

AIE Studies
A solvent–nonsolvent system is typically
preferred to study the difference in AIE behaviors. Among water-miscible
solvents, including tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and 1,4-dioxane,
acetonitrile was preferred because of its relatively lower quantum
yield compared to other solvents (Figure S1). Photophysical studies were carried out for all of the compounds
in acetonitrile solution (10 μM) at room temperature. The AIE
properties were examined by measuring the absorption and emission
spectra for each compound in acetonitrile solution upon gradual addition
of water fraction [a nonsolvent fw (v/v
%)].

The absorption maxima peaked at ∼396 nm was profoundly
observed in the UV–vis absorption spectra due to the familiar
π–π* transitions of anthracene,13 and the peak had a red shift by 5–15 nm upon addition
of water (Figure 3a),
indicating the possibility of J-aggregate formation.14 However, red shift and enhanced fluorescence are not essentially
limited to J-aggregates. The formation of nanoaggregate without J-
or H-aggregation may also cause such effect called the Mie scattering
effect.14a In fact, the crystal packing
of AT2P also reveals no parallel alignment of the molecules
(H-aggregation), rather it is more closer to the shape of J-aggregation
(head-to-tail directional packing).14b The
compound AT2P was fairly emissive at λmax = 490 nm with a quantum yield (Φf) of 10%, which
quenched gradually with the increase of water fraction fw ∼ 70% (Figures 3b and 4a) due to the polarity
effect that can stabilize the excited state.11 Due to the presence of a pyridine ring, there could be a chance
to generate the twisted intramolecular charge-transfer (TICT) state.
However, the effect would be subtle, not like typical push–pull
systems. To confirm the TICT effect, we have measured the emission
spectra in solvents of different polarities, such as hexane, 1,4-dioxane,
and acetonitrile. The red shift (25 nm) was somewhat significant for
both AT3P and AT4P, whereas for AT2P, the shift is only 12 nm (Figure S2).
The quenching of Fl. intensity was observed for all of these compounds
upon increasing the polarity. Thus, the presence of the TICT state
can be anticipated, although the effect is not much significant. There
was a sudden enhancement in the Fl. intensity with 10 nm red shift
when fw > 70% and that reached to a
maximum
between 80 and 90% of fw. The red shift
can also be attributed to the molecular interactions in the aggregates.
Although the measurements of Φf for the aggregates
are known to be erroneous due to the light scattering effect of the
nanoaggregates,15 the quantum yield is
measured to find the emission enhancement factor or AIE measurement
numerical parameter αAIE [(Φf)a/(Φf)s; a: aggregate and s: solution].

is taken at fw = 0 and 90% for all of
these three compounds under 365 nm UV light.

However, considering the quantum yield and Fl. intensity,
the emission
enhancement factor is stated in Table 1. The compound AT2P showed an ∼2-fold
enhancement in fluorescence intensity at fw = 90%. The formation of nanoaggregates for AT2P is
validated through dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies that showed
the average particle size of 116 nm. Thus, this compound was found
to exhibit AIE behavior. The aggregate formation for few other aggregates
was also measured by DLS where the average particle size was found
to be within 200 nm (Table 1). Moreover, the solution of aggregate without any precipitate
indicated the particle size apparently within the nano range. Under
similar conditions, the AIE properties were studied for other regioisomers AT3P and AT4P, where aggregation-caused quenching
(ACQ) effect was observed only for AT3P. Interestingly,
the compound AT3P was more emissive at λmax = 480 nm in the solution state (Φf = 22%) compared
to the other isomers (Figure 4b; Figure S3 for spectra). The
absorption and fluorescence data for all of the compounds studied
herein are tabulated in Table 1. Although the compound AT4P is weakly fluorescent
at λmax = 500 nm (Figure S4) (Φf = 2%), the AIE property was identified (Figure 4c) with a 5-fold
intensity enhancement.9b Hence, the subtle
change in the position of the nitrogen atom in pyridine could affect
the emission behavior in both the solution and aggregate states.

Besides, we replaced tolyl with mesityl to afford AM2P, AM3P, and AM4P that are simply
reachable
and expected to have better Fl. intensity. Apart from little higher
quantum yield, the absorption and emission band appeared at almost
similar λmax (∼480 nm) in the solution state
compared to ATP series. The compound AM2P was fairly fluorescent in solution (Figure S5), and polarity-induced quenching was noted upon increasing the water
fraction, yet it was suddenly enhanced at fw > 60% due to the AIE effect (Figure 5a). However, the Fl. intensity became almost
equal
in the solution and aggregate states and hence αAIE was trivial.

(c) AM4P. [Concentration of the probe: 10 μM, λex = 405 nm.] The image is taken at fw = 0 and 90% for all of these three compounds under 365 nm
UV light.

Alike to AT3P, AM3P also showed ACQ while
it was significantly emissive in solution (Φf = 29%,
higher than AT3P; Figures 5b and 6). Even though the compound AM4P was comparatively weak in emission behavior in solution
(Φf = 4%), the AIE behavior was identified (Figures 5c and S6).

Figure 6 (a) Absorption spectra and (b) emission spectra
of compound AM3P with various water fractions (10 μM;
λex = 405 nm).

Based on our earlier observations on the role of heterocycles
in
originating the AIE effect,9b the comparative
photophysical studies were focused on the regioisomers of thiophene-attached
π-conjugates ATh2P, ATh3P, and ATh4P (Scheme 1). Interestingly, all of these regioisomeric compounds were almost
nonemissive (Φf = <1%; 0.1–0.2%, Table 1) in the solution
state compared to other two series but considerably emissive in the
aggregate state (Figure 7).

Figure 7 I versus I0 (I0: Fl. intensity before addition of water; I: Fl. intensity after addition of water) with fw for (a) ATh2P, (b) ATh3P,
and (c) ATh4P. [Concentration of the probe: 10 μM,
λex = 405 nm.] The image is taken at fw = 0 and 90% for all of these three compounds under 365
nm UV light.

For all of these molecules,
the Fl. intensity remained almost unchanged
when water was added up to 70–80%, and later, it was enhanced
8 times for ATh2P (Figure S7), 12 times for ATh3P (Figure 8), and 45 times for ATh4P (Figure S8 and Table 1). Thus, the AIE effect was very much prominent
for this set of molecules. About 10 nm bathochromic shift was observed
in the Fl. spectra for both aryl-substituted series in the aggregate
state, whereas the thiophenyl compounds showed an ∼30 nm shift.
A remarkable difference was noted for this series where all of the
regioisomers inclusive of ATh3P were AIE-active as shown
in Figures 7 and 8.

Figure 8 (a) Absorption spectra and (b) emission spectra of compound ATh3P with different water fractions (10 μM; λex = 405 nm).

Analysis
To give an insight into the observed differences
in the emission behavior, we have initially made an effort to analyze
the molecular structures and their possible conformational changes
in the solution and aggregate states. The high Fl. intensity for AT3P and AM3P can be accounted to the involvement
of different emitting species, i.e., few conformers that can contribute
to decay in a radiative pathway.

Moreover, the concentration-dependent
fluorescence was studied for all of these molecules to find out the
molecular form present in the solution and that can be responsible
for the variation of Fl. intensity in the solution state. When the
low concentration is maintained at 10–8–10–10 M, the structured band at ∼450 nm was noted
along with a signature at ∼500 nm, which became prominent with
an increase in the concentration of probe AT2P (Figure 9b). The only emission
peaked at ∼500 nm was observed at the concentration of 10–4–10–6 M, where the maximum
intensity was observed at 10–5 M solution (Figure 9a). Based on this
observation, the peak at ∼450 nm can be attributed to the monomer
and the ∼500 nm peak can be accounted for the excimer.16 Hence, the Fl. behavior is sensitive to the
concentration of the solution. Such facts reveal the excimer as an
origin of the emission at this concentration. The λmax values for monomer and excimer are very close to the reported anthracenyl
compounds, indicating the major role of anthracene skeleton in emission
behavior.17

emission spectra of AT2P:
(a) 10–3–10–10 M in 1,4-dioxane
and (b, c) closer look to observe monomer and excimer.

There were no such recognizable changes in the
emission pattern
by changing the concentration for AT3P (Figure 10a), and this can perhaps support
the nonexistence of excimer and can be considered as an origin of
comparatively higher Fl. intensity. For AT4P, the phenomenon
was similar to AT2P, as observed in Figure 10b.

emission spectra of (a) AT3P and (b) AT4P in 1,4-dioxane; (c, d) closer look to
observe monomer and excimer.

Further, the same studies were continued for thiophene series
where
all of the regioisomeric compounds exhibited the monomer and excimer
emission at a lower concentration with extremely low intensity (Figure 11). On gradual increment
of concentration, the intensity became somewhat significant, although
these compounds were almost nonemissive in the solution state. Such
occurrence can also be depicted by the fast intramolecular rotation
process for a small thiophene group, which can serve as a nonradiative
relaxation decay path.1c

emission spectra of (a) ATh2P, (b) ATh3P, and (c) ATh4P in 1,4-dioxane.

Further, fluorescence lifetime measurements were carried
out to
find the excited-state decay behavior for all of these regioisomers.
The excited-state decay pattern was biexponential with major (>90%)
and minor components (<10%) for most of these molecules (except AM3P that showed single exponential decay; see Table S1). The lifetime decay profiles for all
of the compounds in solution and aggregate states are documented in
the Supporting Information (Table S1 and Figures S9–S17). In the aggregate state, all of the molecules
started relaxing through three pathways from the excited state. As
expected, the solutions of AT3P and AM3P had relatively larger weighted mean lifetimes (1.98 and 2.04 ns,
respectively) in comparison to their other regioisomers, and such
relatively higher lifetimes supported the intense emission for these
isomers. The nonfluorescent nature of the aggregate state for these
isomers can be attributed to the relatively shorter excited-state
lifetime (0.11 ns for AT3P and 0.25 ns for AM3P) compared to the other isomers where lifetime was found to be almost
equal to or even higher than the solution state. The relatively larger
lifetime for AM3P also indicated the higher emissive
character. A completely different scenario was noted for thiophene
series where the lifetime was significantly short for all of the isomers
(within 0.02–0.04 ns) in solution state as evident from the
poor emitting ability. Still, in comparison to solution state, the
fluorescence lifetime was significantly boosted for the aggregates
(0.34 ns for ATh2P and 0.68 ns for ATh3P). In particular, ATh4P showed a substantial rise in
the lifetime (from 0.02 ns in the solution state to 0.97 ns in the
aggregate state) to acquire the striking AIE properties.

Crystal Structure
Analyses
As the Fl. behavior differs
in the aggregate state, it is very much essential to understand the
molecular structure with the possible conformational flexibility in
the aggregate state. The supramolecular interactions in the aggregates
can also play a significant role in emission behavior.18 In this context, the determination of X-ray
structures for the regioisomeric molecules and detailed scrutiny on
inter/intramolecular interactions within the molecular packing are
very much crucial. The crystals of some of the compounds (AT2P, AM2P, AM3P, ATh4P, ATh3P) were easily grown from dichloromethane/hexane (1:1)
or EtOAc/hexane mixture by the solvent evaporation method, and the
structures were solved successfully (see Table S2). Few cases (AM2P, AM3P, ATh4P), disorder issues were noted; however, it could be fixed
and refined successfully. Of note, we could not crystallize all of
the regioisomers from the same series. In fact, we were questioning
the difference in molecular conformation and packing between AM3P and ATh3P, where the major difference in
AIE behavior appeared. Compound AT2P crystal grows in
the monoclinic space group P21/c with two symmetry-independent molecules per asymmetric
unit (Figure 12b).19,10a

Figure 12 (a) Molecular packing through ac view for AT2P and
(b) two symmetry-independent molecules with selected torsional angles
(°) and distances (Å).

The torsion angle between anthracene and tolyl ring is 78.7°
for one and 85.6° for another molecule, and it indicates the
better conjugations in one molecule than the other. There are nine
effective intermolecular interactions present in this crystal packing
of AT2P. The strong π···π
interaction with a distance of 3.320 Å was found to be coupled
with multiple C–H···π interactions. However, AM2P crystallizes in a triclinic space group (P1̅) with one symmetry-independent molecule per asymmetric unit
(Figure S18). The twisted molecular structure
has a 95.4° torsional angle between anthracene and mesityl group.
This compound has 10 supramolecular forces like π···π
stacking and C–H···π (Table 2), including strong H···H
interactions (in the range of 2.2–2.4 Å). Therefore, a
good number of intermolecular interactions can confine the molecule
in the twisted conformation within the crystal lattice and restrict
the rotation of molecules, which is proved to be the cause of the
AIE effect.1,2 The detrimental effect of these multiple
interactions within the molecule might also be the cause for mild
AIE effect. Both the compounds AM3P and AT3P exhibit the ACQ effect on aggregation, and the analysis of crystal
structure and packing for AM3P, as obtained, are very
important to explain the observation.

Although
the intermolecular interactions within AM3P are relatively
less (only seven), the molecular structure allowed
to pack with almost 100% overlap with one another from different planes.
In spite of having a twisted molecular structure, it could align exactly
in a parallel orientation to facilitate strong crystal packing where
energy transfer becomes effective. Few strong C–H···π
interactions (Table 2) with distances of 2.781 Å (between two anthracenyl rings),
2.872 Å (anthracene···ethylene), and 2.892 Å
(pyridine···pyridine) play an important role for such
tight molecular packing (Figure 13) with maximum overlap.

and bond distances (Å); (b) molecular packing one after another
that leads to the formation of 100% overlap (with ∼0°
interplanar angle between two layers); and (c) molecular packing (bc
view) with maximum overlap.

Next, the AIE characteristics for ATh3P made
us curious
to find the packing of the molecules in the condensed phase. A detailed
scrutiny on thiophene-based molecular structure reveals comparatively
much better conjugation as the thiophene ring is twisted about 81°
for ATh4P and 74° for ATh3P. In fact, ATh3P had relatively more supramolecular forces where S gets
involved in three types of intermolecular interactions [Figure 14; two S···H
(2.989 Å) and one C···S (3.435 Å), see Table 2], including strong
π···π stacking (3.315 Å), but the
twisted molecular structure rigidifies the molecular conformations
to undergo intramolecular rotation process. Thus, despite the presence
of numerous interactions, twisted molecular conformation did not assist
the formation of exciplex or excimer in the aggregate state (unfavorable
to the fluorescence), rather locked the intramolecular rotation to
result in the enhancement in emission intensity by blocking the nonradiative
pathways.

angles (°) and distances (Å) and (b) molecular packing (bc
view).

The thermal stabilities of these
molecules were determined, and
the TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) studies revealed the decomposition
of all of these molecules only after 300 °C (Figure S20).

Electronic Structure
Following usual
expectations,
the distribution of electron cloud plays a crucial role in dictating
the optical properties of these molecules. Ground-state optimization
using DFT/cam-b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) indicates that the highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) is primarily located on anthracene, while
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) spills over toward
pyridine (Figure 15). However, the overall contribution from anthracene toward HOMO
and LUMO indicates the major role of this skeleton to control the
optical properties of these molecules, as observed experimentally.
We find a reasonable contribution from pyridine to build the LUMO
for these compounds. The relatively small ground-state dipole moment
(ca. 2–3 Debye, Table S3) values
in these compounds indicate a possible absence of typical electron
donor–acceptor moieties.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, three series of pyridinyl molecules have been synthesized
by varying the position of pyridinyl N-atom where the quenching could
favor for AM3P or AT3P (anticipated being
similar packing motif), but the molecular packing of ATh3P did not favor the Fl. quenching in the aggregate state, rather rigidified
the intramolecular rotation that relaxes the molecules from excited
state in a radiative pathway. The multiple supramolecular interactions
with the twisted conformational structure are responsible for such
changes. Thus, the emissive behavior not only differs with the change
in position of pyridyl N-atom, but it also changes with different
substitution at the 10th position of the anthracyl ring. We could
differentiate the emission behavior of the molecules through concentration-dependent
Fl. studies, where only AT3P and AM3P showed
intense fluorescence in solution, originated from monomers. The lifetime
of the excited states could clearly identify the reason for variation
of the Fl. behavior for these regioisomeric molecules with different
substituents. Comparatively better AIE behaviors for thiophenyl-substituted
regioisomers were supported by much longer lifetime in the aggregate
state compared to the solution state. This study will be useful to
explore different AIEgens with the pyridyl core in terms of their
variances in photophysical behaviors by changing the position of N-atom.

Experimental
Section
General Consideration: Reagents
All experiments were
carried out in hot-air oven-dried glassware under nitrogen and argon
atmosphere. Diethyl ((10-(aryl)anthracen-9-yl)methyl)phosphonates
were prepared in our lab using the reported procedure.9e KOtBu was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. THF was redistilled from
sodium metal and benzophenone mixture. All other reagents were purchased
from common suppliers and used without further purification. Column
chromatography was performed by using silica gel 100–200 mesh.
Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on precoated
silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck & Co.) and were visualized
by UV light (∼365 and ∼254 nm).

Analytical Methods
1H, 13C NMR
spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution using Bruker Avance
DRX (400 and 500 MHz). The signals were referenced to tetramethylsilane,
and the solvent used is deuterated chloroform (7.26 ppm in 1H, 77.16 ppm 13C). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm,
and multiplicities are indicated by singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet
(t), and doublet of a doublet (dd). Elemental (elem.) analyses were
carried out on a CHN analyzer. The fluorescence spectra were recorded
on a Hitachi spectrofluorimeter. The electronic absorption spectra
were recorded with a JASCO-650V UV–vis scanning spectrophotometer.
ESI-LCMS was recorded in Shimadzu LCMS-2020. The X-ray quality crystals
of the compounds were grown by slow diffusion of n-hexane over CH2Cl2 solution. The X-ray quality
crystals of the salts of the compounds were grown by slow diffusion
of acetonitrile and hydrochloric acid. Single-crystal X-ray data were
collected on a Rigaku XtaLAB Pro 200 diffractometer using graphite-monochromated
Mo or Cu radiation. Data were collected and processed using CrysAlisPro
(Rigaku Oxford Diffraction). The structures were solved by direct
methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares method using standard
procedures. Absorption corrections were done using Lorentz and polarization
effects, where applicable. In general, all non-hydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically; hydrogen atoms were fixed by geometry or
located by a difference Fourier map and refined isotropically. All
bond angles, bond or other distances, and dihedral angles are determined
using Mercury 3.3 software. Time-resolved measurements were performed
by using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer
(Edinburgh, OB920) with a laser diode source (λexc. = 405 nm). A dilute ludox solution in water was used to measure
lamp profile. F900 decay analysis software was used to analyze the
decay curves by using the nonlinear least-squares iteration method.
The quality of the fit was judged by the chi-square (χ2) values. Solid-state quantum yields were calculated using SC-30
integrating sphere module on FS5 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments).
DLS particle size analysis was carried out using a Zetasizer Nano
S from Malvern Instruments at 25 °C. The DFT studies were performed
using the basis set CAM-B3LYP/6-311++g(d,p).

General Synthesis
((10-(Aryl)anthracen-9-yl)methyl)phosphonate
was taken in a 25 mL round-bottom flask and dissolved in dry THF under
inert atmosphere. An activated base was added to the above solution
under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was stirred for 2–3
min. Then, pyridine-n-carboxaldehyde (n = 2–4) was added and the reaction was stirred for 2–3
h. Completion of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography.
The reaction mixture was quenched with water, washed with brine, and
extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL × 2). The resulting organic
layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated. And
the resulting compound was purified by column chromatography using
fractions of ethyl acetate in hexane.
