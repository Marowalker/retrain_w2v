Hydrogen generation by photocatalytic water splitting
has attained
more and more research interests in the recent years since the solar
energy can be directly transferred and stored as hydrogen. However,
the search for a high-efficiency photocatalyst for water splitting
is a really challenge. In this paper, we designed a novel 2D material-based
van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) composed by g-GaN and BSe, which
is thermally stable at room temperature. The g-GaN/BSe vdWH has suitable
band-edge positions for the oxidation and reduction reactions of water
splitting at pH 0 and 7. The carrier mobility of this heterostructure
is high, indicating the effective occurrence of reactions for water
splitting. The g-GaN/BSe vdWH also possesses a type-II band alignment,
which can promote the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs constantly. Moreover, a large built-in electric field can be
established at the interface, which will further prevent the recombination
of photogenerated charges. In addition, the g-GaN/BSe vdWH also exhibits
outstanding sunlight-absorption ability, and the biaxial strain can
further enhance this ability. Thus, we conclude that the g-GaN/BSe
vdWH can act as a high-efficiency photocatalyst for water splitting.

Introduction
The adoption of clean energy has become
more and more important
as the sources of fossil fuels around the world are depleted. Hydrogen
(H2) is a well-known green energy source because the product
of hydrogen burning is water (H2O). There are many strategies
for hydrogen production, such as electrolysis of water,1,2 thermochemical splitting of water,3−5 catalytic reforming,6−8 and photocatalytic water splitting,9−12 etc., but it is quite challenging
to find a photocatalyst with high efficiency in photocatalysis for
water splitting. Ever since Fujishima and Honda have promoted in 1972
that an electrode based on TiO2 can decompose water into
H2 and O2 via near-ultraviolet light at room
temperature,13 there have been many investigations
on the use of semiconductors as photocatalysts for water splitting.14−16 The essential criteria for a semiconductor to serve as a photocatalyst
in water splitting are suitable band-edge positions for the redox
potentials of water splitting: the energy of conduction band minimum
(CBM) is more positive than −4.44 eV, which is the reduction
potential (H+/H2) of water at pH 0; the energy
of valence band maximum (VBM) is more negative than −5.67 eV
for the oxidation potential (O2/H2O) of water
at pH 0;17 then, the bandgap now is larger
than 1.23 eV. In addition, the semiconductor must have the ability
to absorb sunlight, especially for visible light, because the visible
spectrum occupies more than 40% of the solar spectrum.18

Using two-dimensional (2D) materials as
photocatalysts to decompose
water into H2 and O2 have dominated research
efforts because of their novel electronic, optical, magnetic properties
when compared with those of bulk materials.19−21 First, a high
specific surface area, for example, the specific surface area of the
graphene sheet is 2600 m2·g–1, which
guarantees the reaction on their surface, will occur in an effective
manner.22 Second, atomically thin structures
reduce the time it takes for photogenerated charges to move to the
surface, which can prolong the lifetime of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs.23 Therefore, 2D materials are a
better candidate for photocatalysts in water splitting than the bulk
materials. Indeed, lots of investigations have reported that the 2D
materials, such as graphene,19 monolayer
group III monochalcogenide,14 phosphorene,24−26 and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),27−29 may have the
ability to split water under the illumination of visible light. Moreover,
the formation of heterostructures may generate properties that are
more fascinating than those of the original 2D materials.30−33 For example, a 2D van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) may be more
efficient than a single semiconductor as the photocatalyst used for
water splitting because the oxidation and reduction reactions of water
splitting will take place in different material layers, which will
prevent the reverse reaction of water decomposition.23 Besides, the valence band offset (VBO) and conduction band
offset (VBO) of the vdWH also provide the momentum for the photogenerated
holes and electrons, respectively, to remain in perpetual motion,
which can prolong their lifetimes. The photoexcitation in photocatalysts
of a semiconductor is induced by stimulating the electrons from the
VB to the CB, accompanying by Coulomb interaction, which will result
in spatial restriction of the electron–hole pairs, named as
the exciton. The exciton binding energies (Eeb) can quantitate the efficiency of the prevention for recombination
of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, where the higher
value of Eeb reveals the more difficult
separation of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Some investigations
have confirmed that the Eeb of a heterostructure
is usually lower than the monolayer materials by GW theory.34,35

Recently, graphene-like gallium nitride (g-GaN) captures considerable
attention since it was proposed.36 It is
a semiconductor with an indirect bandgap,37 which can be tuned by chemical modification, stacking structure,
or application of an external electric field.38,39 Its nanoribbons can potentially be used for spintronics under certain
conditions.40 Some calculations have been
implemented to study the properties of its phonon frequency spectrum,
which can prove its stability even at high temperatures.41,42 Furthermore, layered g-GaN has been prepared by encapsulated growth
using graphene enhanced by migration.43 Besides, theoretical predictions suggest that vdWHs based on g-GaN
can exhibit novel properties, such as g-GaN/graphene vdWH, which is
an n-type Schottky contact, and the transformation from n-type to
p-type Schottky contacts can be caused by applying an external electric
field.44 As for g-GaN/BlueP vdWH, which
possesses type-II band alignment, it also has a decent bandgap and
band-edge positions utilized as a photocatalyst for water splitting.45 By calculating the Gibbs free energy, the g-GaN/Mg(OH)2 vdWH expresses a novel catalytic performance in hydrogen
evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction for water splitting.46 All these investigations suggest that g-GaN
can be used in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.

More recently,
another 2D material, monolayered boron selenide
(BSe), has been predicted to have thermal stability with an indirect
bandgap.47 Some heterostructures based
on BSe, such as BSe/ZnO and BSe/blue-phosphorene (BSe/BlueP), have
also been studied.48,49 Interestingly, BSe and g-GaN
monolayers possess the same hexagonal atomic structure and similar
lattice parameters, denoting that they are compatible components of
a vdWH. Here, we investigated the structural, electronic, and optical
properties of g-GaN/BSe vdWH using density functional theory (DTF).
First, thermal stability of lowest-energy stacking configuration of
the heterostructure was determined by ab initio molecular dynamics
(AIMD) simulations. Second, the band structure and the band-edge positions
of g-GaN/BSe vdWH were calculated. We found that band-edge positions
of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH satisfied the energy requirement of oxidation
and reduction reactions for water splitting over a wide pH range.
The carrier mobility of g-GaN and BSe monolayers as well as the g-GaN/BSe
vdWH was also systematically addressed. Then, the interfacial properties
of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH, including the charge-density difference and
the potential drop, were performed. Finally, in-plane strain was applied
to the heterostructure to study how it would tune the optical-absorption
ability, the bandgap, and the band-edge position of the heterostructure
and how it could improve its performance in water splitting.

Results and Discussion
The atomic structures of g-GaN
and BSe monolayers are shown in
the left panel of Figure 1. The optimized lattice parameters are 3.255 and 3.245 Å
for g-GaN and BSe, respectively. The lattice mismatch between g-GaN
and BSe is trivial (only 0.31%), indicating that they are good candidate
for constructing a heterostructure. The band structures of g-GaN and
BSe monolayers are shown in the right panel of Figure 1. The high-symmetry points in BZ are shown
in the inset of Figure 1. Monolayered g-GaN shows indirect semiconductor characteristics
with the CBM located at the Γ point, and the VBM exists at K
point (Figure 1a).
The gap value is 3.203 eV. Meanwhile, monolayered BSe also exhibits
an indirect semiconducting behavior with the VBM located between the
Γ and M points, and the VBM appeared at the Γ point (Figure 1b). The gap value
is of 3.466 eV. Note that the calculated lattice parameters and the
bandgaps of the monolayered g-GaN and BSe are well in agreement with
values reported in previous studies.37,49

represent Ga, N, B, and Se atoms, respectively; the Fermi level is
set as zero by the gray dashed line; the inset shows the high-symmetry
points in the first BZ.

For the g-GaN/BSe heterostructure, six representative
stacking
configurations–H1, H2, H3,
H4, H5, and H6–were considered;
they are illustrated in Figure 2. The binding energy, distance of the interface, and bond
length are calculated for those optimized configurations in Table 1. The most stable
stacking configuration of the heterostructure is decided by the lowest Eb, which is obtained by −54.36 meV/Å2 for the H6 stacking configuration of the g-GaN/BSe
heterostructure, suggesting that the g-GaN/BSe heterostructure is
formed by vdW interaction.50 As for the
optimized H6 stacking configuration, the interlayer distance
(df) is 3.113 Å, the bond length
of Ga–N and B–Se are calculated to be 1.990 and 2.188
Å, respectively. Hereafter, all calculations reported in the
paper for the g-GaN/BSe vdWH are based on this stacking configuration.

To further investigate the thermal stability of the
g-GaN/BSe vdWH
heterostructure, AIMD simulations were performed. A 6 × 6 ×
1 supercell of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH was constructed for the AIMD calculations
with a Nosé–Hoover heat bath scheme,51 which contains 216 atoms. As shown in Figure 3a, the AIMD simulations of
the g-GaN/BSe vdWH indicates that the atomic structure is still robust
within 10 ps at a temperature of 300 K. The fluctuation of temperature
and total energy with the simulation step are expressed in Figure 3b, which shows the
convergence of results. Therefore, the g-GaN/BSe vdWH is thermally
stable at room temperature.

g-GaN/BSe vdWH. (b)

The projected band structure obtained by the HSE06
functional of
the g-GaN/BSe vdWH is shown in Figure 4a. Similar to g-GaN and BSe monolayers, the g-GaN/BSe
vdWH is still a semiconductor and the bandgap is calculated to be
2.268 eV. The CBM is dominated by the BSe layer, while the VBM results
from the g-GaN layer, suggesting that the heterostructure has a staggered
(type-II) band alignment. To further support this, the band-resolved
charge densities of the VBM and the CBM of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH are
presented in Figure 4b; they clearly show that the CBM and VBM of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH are
mainly donated by the BSe and g-GaN layers, respectively. The VBM
mainly results from the s orbital of Ga, while the CBM mainly results
from the p orbital of B. When this type-II heterostructure is illuminated
by light with the energy of photon larger than the bandgaps of monolayered
g-GaN and BSe, the photogenerated electrons will move from the valence
band (VB) to the conduction band (CB), then creating holes in the
VB (Figure 4c). In
addition, the photogenerated electrons tend to migrate from the CB
of the g-GaN layer to the CB of the BSe layer owing to the existence
of conduction band offset (CBO), whereas the photogenerated holes
will migrate from the VB of the BSe layer to that of the g-GaN layer
driven by the valence band offset (VBO). The calculated CBO and VBO
are 0.155 and 0.348 eV, respectively, which ensure the effective separation
of photogenerated electrons and holes.

charges at the interface of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH. (d) Band-edge positions
of g-GaN and BSe monolayers as well as the g-GaN/BSe vdWH.

Suitable band-edge positions act as an important
role for a photocatalyst
in water splitting. Then, the band alignment of g-GaN and BSe monolayers
as well as the g-GaN/BSe vdWH was calculated by the HSE06 functional,
as shown in Figure 4d. The potential of reduction and oxidation are influenced by the
pH level via Ered = −4.44 eV +
pH × 0.059 eV and Eoxd = −5.67
eV + pH × 0.059 eV, respectively.52 Thus, the reduction potential is −4.44 (−4.03) and
the oxidation potential is −5.67 (−5.26) eV at pH 0
(7) for water splitting. One can see that both monolayered g-GaN and
BSe are equipped with the decent energy level of band-edge positions
for the redox reaction potential of water splitting at pH 0 and 7.
However, such a single semiconductor is hardly to be used as photocatalysts
for water splitting owing to a rather short lifetime for photogenerated
charges (about 3–10 ps),45 while
the formation of vdWH can prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated
charges by inducing the redox reactions occuring at different layers.45 Fortunately, we found the g-GaN/BSe vdWH also
has the suitable band-edge positions for water splitting at both pH
0 and 7, which indicates its potential in photocatalysts for water
splitting.

The electron and hole mobilities in g-GaN and BSe
monolayers as
well as the g-GaN/BSe vdWH were also investigated as they are important
factors that control the usefulness of the material as a photocatalyst.
The two charge-transport directions are armchair (A1) and zigzag (A2) directions,
as shown in Figure 5a–c. The response of the energy for the external strain of
the monolayered g-GaN and BSe monolayers as well as the g-GaN/BSe
vdWH are expressed in Figure 5d,f,h, respectively, which are useful to calculate the elastic
modulus for those layered materials. The change in CBM and VBM energy
resulting from the external strain for g-GaN and BSe monolayers as
well as the g-GaN/BSe vdWH is shown in Figure 5e,g,i, respectively. Table 2 shows the calculated effective mass, elastic
modulus, and carrier mobility of g-GaN and BSe monolayers as well
as the g-GaN/BSe vdWH at 300 K. The obtained electron mobilities in
monolayered g-GaN, BSe, and the g-GaN/BSe vdWH are 287.93, 355.99,
and 2207.53 cm2·V–1·s–1, respectively, along the armchair direction, while the mobilities
are 304.15, 419.01, and 2129.38 cm2·V–1·s–1, respectively, along the zigzag direction.
Meanwhile, the mobilities of holes in g-GaN and BSe monolayers as
well as the g-GaN/BSe vdWH are 1741.43, 17.01, and 315.63 cm2·V–1·s–1, respectively,
along the armchair direction, and the 2395.72, 18.25, and 306.94 cm2·V–1·s–1, respectively,
along the zigzag direction. One can clearly see that the g-GaN/BSe
vdWH can improve the carrier mobility of the monolayered BSe along
both the transport directions. Furthermore, when compared with the
carrier mobilities in other 2D materials, which can be also used as
photocatalysts for water splitting, the values in the g-GaN/BSe vdWH
is higher than those in BlueP (1711 cm2·V–1·s–1),53 MoS2 (200.52 cm2·V–1·s–1),54 and WS2 (542.29 cm2·V–1·s–1).35 Therefore, compared with those 2D
materials, the g-GaN/BSe vdWH has advantageous ability to promote
the photogenerated electron–hole pairs flowing to the surface,
which guarantees the occurrence of oxidation and reduction reactions.55 Therefore, with such a high carrier mobility,
the g-GaN/BSe vdWH can reduce the carrier recombination rate to ensure
the better photocatalytic performance.56

Then, we turn to investigate the interface properties
of g-GaN/BSe
vdWH. The charge difference (Δρ) was calculated by Bader
charge analysis.57−59 The isosurfaces of charge difference are shown in Figure 6a, and one can clearly
see that the g-GaN layer act as an acceptor of 0.0031 |e| electrons
form the BSe layer. In addition, a large potential drop (ΔV) of 5.712 eV across the interface of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH
can be found in Figure 6b, indicating that a strong built-in electric field is generated,
which will further cause the separation of photogenerated electron–hole
pairs.

green, and orange spheres represent Ga, N, B, and Se atoms, respectively;

the isosurface value was used by 0.015 |e|. (b) Potential drop across
the interface of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH.

The ability to capture a considerable fraction
from the spectrum
of visible light is a significant requirement for photocatalysts used
for water splitting because the visible light spectrum (about 380–800
nm) occupies almost half of the solar spectrum.18 The optical absorption spectrum for the g-GaN/BSe vdWH
is expressed in Figure 7a. The maximum absorption of visible light by the g-GaN/BSe vdWH
is 1.470 × 105 cm at a wavelength of 380 nm, and there
is another absorption peak located at 420 nm in the visible light
region. The calculated optical absorption of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH indicates
that it possesses excellent capacity to capture the visible spectrum.
Furthermore, we also apply the biaxial strain on the g-GaN/BSe vdWH
to see whether it can further enhance the optical-absorption ability.
The results are also shown in Figure 7a. When the heterostructure was subjected to tensile
strain values of 1, 2, 3, and 4%, peaks observed at 1.583 × 105, 1.542 × 105, 1.502 × 105, and 1.471 × 105 cm, respectively, are recorded
at wavelengths of 394, 411, 437, and 468 nm, respectively. It is evident
that the redshift phenomenon is observed in the spectrum of g-GaN/BSe
vdWH and the overlap between the absorption spectrum and the solar
flux become larger after the application of a biaxial tensile strain.
Therefore, the application of a biaxial tensile strain can enhance
the sunlight-absorption ability of the heterostructure. Besides, in
the ultraviolet region, there are also some absorption peaks for g-GaN/BSe
vdWH, which is even higher than the other reported 2D vdWHs, such
as AlN/BP (AlN/BP Heterostructure Photocatalyst for Water Splitting),
g-GaN/BlueP (RSC Adv.), WS2/BSe (WS2/BSe van
der Waals type-II heterostructure as a promising water splitting photocatalyst),
etc., as a photocatalyst for water splitting.

(b) Band-edge alignment for the g-GaN/BSe vdWH under biaxial tensile
strain with respect to the potentials of oxidation and reduction at
pH of 0 and 7 for water splitting.

Using biaxial strain to tune the electronic properties
of the 2D
heterostructure is also a popular method.60 The variation of bandgap of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH with tensile strain
is shown in Figure 7b. In general, the energy of the CBM quickly decreases when the tensile
strain increased to 5%, whereas the energy of the VBM gradually increases
with the strain. The band-edge positions of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH remain
suitable for the oxidation potential (O2/H2O)
and reduction potential (H+/H2) at pH 0 and
7 for water splitting under strain strengths of 1 and 2%. When the
tensile strain with strengths of 3 or 4% is applied, the g-GaN/BSe
vdWH can decompose water into H2 and O2 at pH
0. Therefore, the applied tensile strain not only increases the sunlight-absorption
ability of the heterostructure but also retains its application in
photocatalysts for water splitting in a certain region.

Conclusions
The structural, electronic, interfacial,
and optical properties
of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH were explored by DFT calculations. The most
stable configuration of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH was obtained with a binding
energy of −54.36 meV/Å2, which is proved to
be thermally stable at room temperature by AIMD simulations. The g-GaN/BSe
vdWH is an indirect semiconductor with a gap value of 2.268 eV. It
also possesses a type-II band alignment, which can prevent recombination
of the photogenerated electrons and holes. The band-edge positions
of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH show that the heterostructure has suitable band
edges for the redox potential of water splitting at pH 0 and 7. Then,
the high carrier mobility was found in the g-GaN/BSe vdWH that the
mobility for electrons are 2207.53 and 2129.38 cm2·V–1·s–1 along armchair and zigzag
directions, respectively. The hole mobilities for the g-GaN/BSe vdWH
are 315.63 and 306.94 cm2·V–1·s–1 along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively.
Furthermore, the formation of a large in-built electric field was
found at the interface, which can also promote the separation of photogenerated
charges. Moreover, the g-GaN/BSe vdWH shows excellent absorption ability
for sunlight, which can also be effectively enhanced by applying a
biaxial tensile strain. These findings suggest the promising role
of g-GaN/BSe vdWH as a high-efficiency photocatalyst to decompose
water for hydrogen production. Our work is also expected to offer
guidelines for the design of other heterostructures based on g-GaN
or BSe as photocatalysts for water splitting.

Methodology
In this research, all simulations were
carried out by first-principles
calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)61 based on density functional theory. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) functional62 based on generalized
gradient approximation (GGA) was implemented for the exchange correlation
functional. The hybrid Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)
functional was also utilized for more accurate bandgap calculations.
A relatively large 550 eV plan-wave cutoff was used to guarantee the
accuracy of calculations. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) was sampled
by Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh with a grid
of 17 × 17 × 1 in reciprocal space. The vacuum slab is 20
Å, which can effectively reduce interactions between adjacent
atomic layers. All the structures were fully relaxed until the Hellmann–Feynman
force on each atom is smaller than 0.01 eV·Å–1. Besides, the convergence range for energy was set to less than
1 × 10–5 eV. In addition, weak dispersion forces
were corrected by using the DFT-D3 method of Grimme,63 and dipole corrections were also considered in all of the
calculations.

The binding energy (Eb) was calculated
as follows 1  where Eg-GaN/BSe, Eg-GaN, and EBSe represent the total energy
of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH, g-GaN monolayer, and BSe monolayer, respectively.

The charge-density difference (Δρ) was calculated by 2  where Δρg-GaN/BSe, Δρg-GaN, and ΔρBSe are the total charge density of the g-GaN/BSe vdWH, g-GaN monolayer,
and BSe monolayer, respectively.

The carrier mobility of each
of the 2D materials (μ2D) was decided by the deformation
potential theory64 3  where e is
the charge of an electron, h is the reduced Planck’s
constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, me* is the effective mass along the
transport direction, and md is the average
effective mass, which was calculated using . The deformation potential constant (E1) of the electron in the CBM and the hole in
the VBM along the transport direction is expressed as E1i = ΔVi/(Δl/l0), where ΔVi is the energy difference between the CBM and VBM under
an applied strain in the range of −0.5 to 0.5%, l0 is the lattice parameter, and Δl is the deformation of l0 by strain.
The elastic modulus of the 2D material (C2D) is defined as C2D = [∂2ΔE/∂l2]/S0, where ΔE is the energy
difference compared with the unstrained 2D system, l is the applied strain, and S0 is the
lattice volume of the 2D system at equilibrium.

The absorption
coefficient was obtained using the equation65 4  where ε1(ω)
and ε2(ω) are used for the real and imaginary
parts of the dielectric constant, respectively. Moreover, ω,
α, and c express the angular frequency, absorption
coefficient, and the speed of light in vacuum, respectively.
