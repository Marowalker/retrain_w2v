The
utilization of sucrose, an easily accessible disaccharide,
in the production of a versatile platform chemical lactic acid (LA),
is more attractive than a monosaccharide. In this work, we report
a modification approach by 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to introduce
an amino group onto the surface of the Sn-Beta Lewis acid catalyst.
Using the modified catalyst, a maximum LA yield of 58% was achieved
under optimal hydrothermal conditions (190 °C, 4 h) from sucrose,
along with a complete conversion and a reduced 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) yield of 8% compared to Sn-Beta. To evaluate the role of the
amino group, different substrates were used as the reactants to produce
LA. The experimental results suggested that both fructose and glucose
were crucial intermediates in the initial 2 h, whereas glucose is
the sole reactant after 2 h. Upon modification, not only the hydrolysis
of sucrose was promoted, but the side reaction of HMF formation was
also suppressed.

1 Introduction
The
rapid consumption of fossil fuels as the main energy resource
has made it of great urgency to develop alternative energy and materials
in industries. As a promising novel material, polylactic acid is widely
used in the manufacture of plastics, surgical sutures, and artificial
limbs for its strength, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.1 The monomer of polylactic acid, namely lactic
acid (LA), can be obtained from carbohydrates through biological or
chemical routes. Chemical catalytic methods have the advantages of
high product purity and reaction rate over biological processes.2

LA and its esters can be synthesized by
chemical routes from various
substrates, including monosaccharide and polysaccharide sugars,3,4 glycerol,5 lignocellulose,6,7 and crops.8−10 Among all the chemical catalytic approaches, the
LA yields obtained over homogeneous catalysts were rather high. The
LA yield obtained from glucose can be above 70% (71% at 170 °C
over lead(II) for 2 h; 76% at 240 °C over ErCl3 for
0.5 h; 81% at 180 °C over Al(III)–Sn(II) for 2 h).6,11,12 Compared to homogeneous catalysts,
the LA yields obtained over heterogeneous ones were not that high
(34% at 180 °C for 2 h over Al–Zr mixed oxides; 28% at
190 °C for 24 h over tungstated alumina; 39% at 250 °C for
4 h over Nb2O5; 48 and 23% at 190 °C for
2 h over Zn–Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta, respectively; and 52% at 190
°C for 2 h over Pb–Sn-Beta).13−17 In spite of the lower LA yield, heterogeneous approaches
are sometimes more acceptable for large-scale production compared
to homogeneous ones in terms of purification cost and catalyst recycling.
Therefore, the chemical routes, especially over heterogeneous catalysts,
have their practical significance. Fructose is thought to be an ideal
feedstock to produce LA because the isomerization step could be skipped
compared to other substrates. Satisfactory LA yields have been achieved
using fructose.3,6 However, from the economic prospective,
fructose is far less abundant and accessible than glucose, and so
the high price of fructose often acts as an obstacle to its large-scale
application. Sucrose, a disaccharide that can be easily obtained from
plants, is presumed to be another applicable substrate to produce
LA. The conversion of sucrose into LA starts with the hydrolysis of
sucrose to glucose and fructose, which is followed by the isomerization
of glucose to form fructose, a retro-aldol reaction of fructose to
form glyceraldehyde and dioxyacetone, the pyruvic aldehyde production
from the dehydration of trioses, the hydration of pyruvic aldehyde,
and finally the 1,2-hydride shift to produce LA.16

For all the reaction steps involved in the conversion
process,
Lewis acid is effective in the isomerization, retro-aldol, and 1,2-hydride
shift reactions. Therefore, numerous Lewis acid catalysts have been
employed in the production of LA. In chemical catalytic processes,
heterogeneous catalysts are more preferable to homogeneous ones in
terms of separation and recyclability. The incorporation of Sn in
the framework of Beta zeolite has been proved to be an efficient way
to obtain heterogeneous Lewis acid catalysts, and the Sn-Beta catalysts
have shown great potential in the chemical conversion of carbohydrates
into LA under hydrothermal conditions. In spite of its catalytic efficiency,
the conventional hydrothermal synthesis method is an extraordinarily
time-consuming process which costs more than 10 days. The inevitable
use of hydrofluoric acid as the mineralization agent also makes the
method environmentally unfriendly.3,4,18,19 Therefore, great efforts
have been made to address the challenge of synthesizing the Sn-Beta
Lewis acid catalyst. Li et al. introduced the postsynthesis modification
through the solid–gas reaction using SnCl4 vapor
to insert the Sn species into the framework of dealuminated Beta zeolite.20 The Sn-Beta zeolite synthesized by this process
contains a higher Sn content and proposes less diffusion limitation
to the bulky molecules compared to that synthesized from the conversional
hydrothermal process. Kang et al. explored the possibility of preparing
Sn-Beta zeolites with high crystallinity by a simple steam-assisted
conversion method using a dry stannosilicate gel, which was prepared
from SiO2, SnCl4·5H2O, tetraethylammonium
hydroxide, and NH4F, followed by drying at 60 °C for
6 h.21 Zhu et al. synthesized the highly
hydrophobic Sn-Beta zeolite via hydrothermal interzeolite transformation
and shortened the crystallization time to 3 d successfully.22 Zhang et al. reported a facile and efficient
route to preparing a hierarchical Sn-Beta zeolite to promote the alkyl
lactate from sucrose.23 The synthesized
hierarchical zeolite, templated with cationic polymers, by their one-pot
methodology, could accelerate the diffusion of saccharides and further
suppress the undesirable side reactions. Different from that mentioned
above, the solid-state ion-exchange (SSIE) method reported by Hammond
et al. simply involves mechanical grinding and the following calcination
and provides a rapid and effective strategy for the incorporation
of Lewis acid sites into the dealuminated Beta zeolite framework.24 Sn-Beta prepared by the SSIE method is widely
acceptable in the catalytic transformation of biomass. In the conversion
of carbohydrates and their derivates to LA, however, it is also important
to explore further modification methods to achieve the multifunctionalization
of this Lewis acid catalyst. The introduction of other metals is possible
according to previous reports, and different elements could play different
roles in this reaction.16,17,25 Dong et al. first developed a catalyst combining two common metals
(Zn–Sn-Beta) via SSIE.16 According
to their report, the Zn species incorporated into the deAl-Beta zeolite
could enhance the base sites of the catalyst, which were beneficial
to hinder the side dehydration reaction from glucose and fructose
to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). Wan et al. reported an efficient
one-pot conversion of acetol to LA over a bifunctional dealuminated
Sn-Beta-supported gold catalyst.25 The
synthesis process of Au/deAl-Sn-Beta catalyst mainly involves two
steps, namely the SSIE procedure to form deAl-Sn-Beta zeolite and
thereafter the sol immobilization method to load Au on the support
synthesized before. Xia et al. also reported a bimetal-modified Beta
zeolite Pb–Sn-Beta catalyst synthesized by SSIE for converting
carbohydrates into LA.17 For the Pb–Sn-Beta
catalyst, the loaded lead could promote the isomerization of glucose
to fructose and the retro-aldol condensation reaction from fructose
to C3 intermediates (dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehydes).

As the starting step to produce LA from sucrose, once the hydrolysis
step is promoted, a more favorable LA yield may be achieved in comparison
with glucose and fructose. The hydrolysis of sucrose can be accomplished
with the aid of an acid or base. Considering that the introduction
of a base can also lead to the suppression of glucose or fructose
dehydration to HMF, the main side reaction in the LA production process,
we come up with an idea to introduce basicity into the acidic Sn-Beta
zeolite catalyst. Besides, for an organic reaction, the organic functionalization
of the inorganic support surface to adjust its surface properties
may be an alternative way to metal modification.26,27 The promoted interaction opportunity between the reactant and the
catalyst by this means can result in an enhanced reactivity. The amino
group (−NH2) is a typical alkaline functional group
in organic chemistry. Previous reports have testified that amino groups
could be grafted onto the surface of catalysts containing silanol
groups through a condensation reaction.28−32 Therefore, a modification of the Sn-Beta zeolite
by an amino group is introduced in the current work to obtain a catalyst
containing both Lewis acid and basic sites. The Lewis acid generated
from Sn promotes the isomerization of glucose and retro-aldolization
reaction afterward, whereas the basic sites promote the sucrose hydrolysis
and suppress the formation of the main side product HMF. The catalyst
preparation condition and reaction parameters were systematically
optimized, and a possible reaction pathway was also proposed based
on the catalyst characterization and the reaction results using different
substrates.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Commercial Beta zeolite
with a Si/Al ratio of 25 (Catalyst Plant of Nankai University) was
used as the supporter. The reagents used in the experiments were tin(II)
acetate (95%) (Alfa Aesar), 1.0 N LA (Alfa Aesar), HMF (97%) (Alfa
Aesar), levulinic acid (98%) (Alfa Aesar), cellulose (Alfa Aesar),
formic acid (99%) (J&K), acetic acid (99%) (J&K), 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane
(APTMS) (98%) (Wako), sucrose (Aladdin), acetol (97%) (Aladdin), phosphoric
acid (high-performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) (Sigma-Aldrich),
nitric acid [GR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (SCRC)], ethanol
(AR, SCRC), d-(+)-glucose (AR, SCRC), d-(+)-fructose
(AR, SCRC), lactose (AR, SCRC), starch (AR, SCRC), cellobiose (98%,
SCRC), sulfuric acid (AR, SCRC), and hydrochloric acid (AR, SCRC).

2.2 Catalyst Synthesis Procedure
Sn-Beta
zeolite was prepared via the SSIE method according to our previous
report.16 Afterward, the amino groups (−NH2) were postgrafted on the surface of the Sn-Beta zeolite with
the aid of APTMS. The postgrafting was carried out as follows: 0.5
g of Sn-Beta zeolite and a certain volume of APTMS were mixed in 250
mL of ethanol in a flask equipped with a reflux condenser at 80 °C.
After 6 h, the wet white powder was collected by filtration and washed
with sufficient ethanol to remove the residual APTMS. After drying
at 80 °C for 12 h, the aminopropyl-incorporated Sn-Beta zeolite
catalyst was obtained and denoted as Sn-Beta-NH2(v) [v represents the volume of APTMS used (μL)].

2.3 Catalyst Characterizations
The total
organic carbon (TOC) measurement was determined using an Analytikjena
multi N/C 2100 analyzer. The N contents of the catalysts were determined
on an Elementar Vario EL III elemental analyzer at 1000 °C. The
Sn contents within the catalysts were determined by inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES) on a PerkinElmer
Optima 2100DV. Prior to the measurements, the catalysts were digested
in an acidic mixture made of HCl and HNO3 at 150 °C
for 12 h. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) survey was carried out
on a Nicolet Is5 instrument at room temperature, and the spectra were
recorded in the 4000–500 cm–1 range. The
acid–base properties of the catalysts were measured by a chemisorption
analyzer (AutoChem II 2920) using the NH3- or CO2-TPD (temperature-programmed desorption) method. The acid types and
the amounts of catalysts were studied by the adsorption and TPD of
pyridine, and FT-IR spectroscopy was performed afterward on a PerkinElmer
frontier FT-IR in the range of 1400–1700 cm–1 at a spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. A self-supporting
pellet made of 10 mg samples was first placed in the flow cell and
evacuated under reduced pressure at 400 °C for 2 h. It was then
cooled to room temperature under dynamic vacuum, followed by employing
pyridine vapor into the cell and performing the adsorption for 0.5
h. Finally, desorption steps were conducted at different temperatures
(25, 150, and 250 °C) for 1 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray powder
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å)
at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA over a 2θ range
of 10°–90° with a scan speed of 5°/min. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained using
a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 analyzer at −196 °C. X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) studies were performed on an RBD-upgraded PHI-5000C
ESCA system (PerkinElmer) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV), and charge referencing was done against adventitious
carbon (C1s at 284.6 eV). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) was performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN microscope with an acceleration
voltage of 200 kV.

2.4 Catalytic Reactions and
Product Analysis
The catalytic conversion of sucrose or monosaccharide
to LA was
carried out in a Teflon reactor in a stainless steel autoclave with
an inner volume of 50 mL. For each reaction, the reactor was charged
with 225 mg of substrate, a certain quality of catalyst, and the autoclave
was kept at the desired reaction temperature for a desired period
of time. After the reaction, the liquid-phase products were centrifugated,
filtrated, and diluted for analysis by an Agilent 1200 series HPLC.
The concentration of saccharine was determined using an RI detector
(Bio-Rad HPX-87H column), and the temperatures of the column and the
RI detector were 55 and 45 °C, respectively. The mobile phase
was a 5 mM aqueous sulfuric acid solution with a flow rate of 0.5
mL/min. For the yield of LA, HMF, formic acid, levulinic acid, acetic
acid, and acetol, a Gemini-NX 5u C18 column was employed, where a
0.1% aqueous phosphoric acid solution with a flow rate of 1 mL/min
was used as the mobile phase. All the experiments were performed for
more than three times, and the quantitative data were the average
values of the analytical results. The relative errors were less than
10% for all experiments.

3 Results and Discussion
It is well-known that polysaccharides and disaccharides could easily
dehydrate to monosaccharides and then convert to LA and HMF as the
main products by the aid of acid catalysts.19,33,34 The production of LA is catalyzed by Lewis
acid, and the produced LA will inevitably act as a Brønsted acid
to catalyze the HMF production. In the presence of Sn-Beta-NH2, the main reaction to produce LA was catalyzed by the Lewis
acid sites generated from Sn, and the side reaction, in this case,
was hindered by the base sites generated from the amino groups (−NH2) (Scheme 1). Notably, both the Lewis acid sites and base sites could promote
the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose. In the meantime,
the base sites could also inhibit the side reaction of glucose and
fructose dehydration to HMF spontaneously, competing with the desired
product LA in this reaction, as reported in the literature.16,23,35−39

Scheme 1 Proposed Reaction Pathways in the Conversion of Sucrose
to LA
3.1 Reaction Pathways in the
Conversion of Sucrose
to LA over Sn-Beta-NH2 Catalyst
Sucrose, the main
substrate in this study, could produce the same mole of glucose and
fructose under acid or base condition. According to our hypothesis,
the hydrolysis reaction of sucrose and the conversion of glucose and
fructose to LA mainly took place through two possible pathways: one
is that sucrose dehydrated to glucose first, and then glucose isomerizated
to fructose to produce LA; the other is that sucrose dehydrated to
fructose first and then produced LA or isomerizated to glucose to
further produce LA. To gain an insight into the probable pathway in
this reaction, three substrates, sucrose, fructose, and glucose, were
utilized in the catalytic reaction over the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolite at 190 °C for a prolonged reaction time (Figure 1).

Figure 1 (A) Conversion of sucrose
and yield of glucose, fructose, and LA.
(B) Conversion of fructose and yield of glucose and LA. (C) Conversion
of glucose and yield of fructose and LA. Reaction conditions: 225
mg of substrates, 140 mg of Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst, 10
mL of H2O, 190 °C.

In the conversion of sucrose, the yields of fructose were
25 and
40% for 0.5 and 1 h reaction, respectively, and decreased to below
5%. Then, the fructose produced was completely converted after 2 h
reaction. The yield of glucose in the sucrose conversion reaction
increased from 25 to 46% for 1 h and then dropped to a constant value
of 3% with the prolonged reaction time, showing a similar trend with
the fructose yield (Figure 1A). Therefore, during the conversion of sucrose, glucose and
fructose were both the main reaction substrates in the initial 2 h
reaction time, and after 2 h, glucose became the sole reactant to
produce LA.

To confirm the above analysis, the two main intermediates,
namely
the hydrolysis products of sucrose, fructose and glucose, were utilized
under the same reaction conditions. It could be seen that the conversion
of fructose was nearly 100% after a 2 h reaction, and the yield of
glucose, which was obtained from the isomerization of fructose, remained
below 10% (Figure 1B). Using glucose as the substrate, the yield of fructose within
the initial 1 h was 16%, and the substrate was completely converted
after 2 h (Figure 1C). The conversion of glucose increased from 34% to around 96% with
the prolonged time. This difference indicated that as the isomer of
fructose, glucose was more readily converted into fructose, but not
the other way around. The LA yields reached the maximum values of
58, 49, and 49% for the conversion of sucrose, fructose, and glucose
at 4, 2, and 4 h, respectively. Fructose, as the main hydrolysis product
of sucrose and isomerization product of glucose, could be converted
quickly and easily to LA and other side products at a relatively high
temperature (>150 °C).40−42 These phenomena suggested that
both glucose and fructose were the crucial intermediates for the conversion
of sucrose to LA during the initial 2 h reaction time.

3.2 Parameter Optimization of Catalyst Preparation
and Reaction
We performed the conversion of sucrose over
the catalysts prepared using various dosages of APTMS at 190 °C
for 4 h in 10 mL of water. Shown in Figure 2 are the sucrose conversion and product yields
obtained over the catalysts prepared using different dosages of APTMS.
In the absence of amino groups (Sn-Beta zeolite), sucrose could hydrolyze
completely with an LA yield of 23%. No fructose, but a glucose yield
of 5% was obtained. The presence of APTMS with a dosage of 10 μL
decreased the glucose yield (3%) and promoted the LA yield remarkably
up to 58%. When the dosage of APTMS exceeded 10 μL, the LA yield
exhibited a decreasing tendency, whereas the glucose yield showed
the opposite, which may be ascribed to the excessive alkalinity and
the screening of Lewis acid sites caused by the postgrafted organoamines
on the surface of NH2-supporting catalysts. It could be
concluded that the incorporation of base sites indeed promoted the
yield of LA, wereas the collaborative relationship between the base
sites and the Lewis acid sites needs further exploration.

Figure 2 Conversion
of sucrose and yield of fructose, glucose, and LA over
various NH2-supporting catalysts. Reaction conditions:
225 mg of sucrose, 140 mg of catalyst, 10 mL of H2O, 190
°C, 4 h.

With the aim of investigating
the well-balanced acid–base
sites, a series of tin(II) acetate dosage were used in the preparation
of Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolite catalysts. As shown in Figure 3, with the increasing
dosage of tin(II) acetate, the yield of LA catalyzed by Sn-Beta zeolite
first increased and then became almost constant. When the dosage was
increased to 500 mg, the LA yield exhibited a sharp decrease, which
might be due to the congestion inside the Sn-Beta zeolite. For the
Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolite, a different trend of LA yield
was observed, with an optimum tin(II) acetate dosage of 200 mg and
an LA yield of 58%. When the tin(II) acetate dosage exceeded 200 mg,
the LA yield decreased from 58 to 32%. It was clear that the LA yield
reached a maximum at the same tin(II) acetate dosage (200 mg) over
the Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts. We speculated
that for a tin(II) acetate dosage below the optimum, the amount of
Lewis acid sites generated from the Sn species was not enough to improve
the LA yield from sucrose. Meanwhile, a high tin(II) acetate dosage
gave rise to excessive Lewis acid sites, compared to which the number
of basic sites was insufficient to suppress the side reaction, thus
leading to a low LA yield. Consequently, a balance between Lewis acid
and basic sites was of vital importance to a high LA yield.

Figure 3 Effect of tin(II)
acetate dosage on the conversion of sucrose to
LA over the Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts. Reaction
conditions: 225 mg of sucrose, 140 mg of catalyst, 10 mL of H2O, 190 °C, 4 h.

In addition to the dosage of APTMS and tin(II) acetate, the
effect
of the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) dosage employed in the catalytic
reaction on the formation of LA from sucrose was also studied (Figure 4). For a 4 h reaction,
the conversion of sucrose and glucose yield remained 100% and around
4%, respectively, when the dosage of the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst increased from 120 to 220 mg, indicating that the influence
of the increasing catalyst amount on sucrose conversion was negligible.
The LA yield increased from 49 to 59% in parallel with the increasing
catalyst dosage from 120 to 160 mg, and the LA yield kept at around
60%. In the range of 140 to 220 mg, the LA yield was almost constant
for a 4 h reaction and was less affected by the catalyst dosage. Therein,
140 mg was chosen as the catalyst dosage in the following experiments.

Figure 4 Effect
of catalyst dosage on the yield of LA over the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst. Reaction conditions: 225 mg of sucrose, 10
mL of H2O, 190 °C, 4 h.

Figure 5 revealed
that the reaction temperature also had a great effect on the yield
of LA from sucrose conversion. At a relatively low reaction temperature
(below 190 °C), the yield of LA exhibited an increasing trend
and then reached the maximum value of 58% at 190 °C. When the
reaction temperature was over 200 °C, a sharp decrease in LA
yield was observed, which might be caused by the inactivation of the
supporting amino groups. It was suggested that 190 °C and 4 h
were sufficient for the catalytic reaction.

Figure 5 Effect of reaction temperature
on the yield of LA over the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst. Reaction
conditions: 225 mg of sucrose, 140
mg of catalyst, 10 mL of H2O, 4 h.

In addition, we further examined the remaining percent of
TOC in
the reaction solution and product distributions over the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst during the reaction process. Figure S1 presented the product distributions as a function
of reaction time, including the hydrolysis products glucose and fructose,
the target product LA, the main by-product HMF, organic acids, and
acetol. Among these products, formic acid and levulinic acid mainly
came from the rehydration of HMF and thus could be seen as the relative
products to HMF. In the initial 1 h, the sucrose was completely converted
and the LA yield sharply increased to 13 from 38% as the reaction
time increased from 1 to 2 h. For a reaction time of 2 and 4 h, the
remaining percent of TOC was 91 and 84%, respectively. After the reaction,
the color of the reaction liquid became deep brown, which was caused
by the formation of soluble polymers and insoluble humins from the
cross-polymerization of sugar, HMF, and organic acids. These insoluble
products accounted mainly for the missing portion of the overall mass
balance.

3.3 Catalytic Performance Comparison of Sn-Beta
and Sn-Beta-NH2(10)
To demonstrate the advantage
of the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolites prepared by postgrafting
of amino groups, the conversion of sucrose to LA was chosen as the
model reaction. The yield of HMF, as the main side product, was also
analyzed. The yields of both LA and the main side product HMF as a
function of time-on-stream during sucrose conversion over the Sn-Beta
and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolites are shown in Figure 6. The LA yield increased as
the reaction time prolonged, with the highest value being 27%, and
decreased sharply after 4 h over the Sn-Beta catalyst. The maximum
HMF yield (26%) over the Sn-Beta catalyst was obtained at 2 h, and
then the HMF yield showed a decreasing trend with an increasing reaction
time. The decrease might be ascribed to the rehydration of HMF to
form formic acid and levulinic acid. It was revealed from the figure
that 190 °C and 4 h were sufficient for the Sn-Beta catalytic
reaction system, but the obtained LA yield was relatively low with
regard to the HMF yield. On the contrary, using Sn-Beta-NH2(10) as the catalyst, the yield of LA was remarkably promoted to 58%
for a 4 h reaction, and the HMF yield sharply decreased (8%) upon
the introduction of the basic amino groups. These results indicated
that not only Lewis acid sites from Sn species, but the base sites
from the −NH2 groups also played a vital role in
the conversion of sucrose to LA.

Figure 6 Yield of LA and HMF over the Sn-Beta and
Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts. Reaction conditions: 225 mg
of sucrose, 140 mg of catalyst,
10 mL of H2O, 190 °C.

In previous studies, LA has been prepared from sucrose over
homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalysts. The catalytic activity of the as-prepared
Sn-Beta-NH2(10) in our work was also compared to the catalysts
reported by the previous literature, and the comparative results are
presented in Table 1. The LA yields obtained over Zn–Sn-Beta, Pb–Sn-Beta,
and Sn-Beta were below 54, 51%, and less than 30%, respectively. The
LA yield obtained in our work under the same reaction conditions (190
°C, 2 h) was higher than that in the mentioned literature and
was even higher than that obtained by the homogeneous ZnSO4 catalyst, which gave a LA yield of around 40% under harsh reaction
conditions (400 ppm ZnSO4, 1 wt % sugar, 300 °C, 25
MPa).43 Moreover, Zn–Sn-Beta and
Pb–Sn-Beta suffered from the disadvantages of toxicity and
metal loss during the reaction process, and ZnSO4 could
not be reused. Hence, Sn-Beta-NH2(10) is a superior catalyst
for the production of LA under our reaction conditions.

3.4 Analysis
of Acid–Base Properties
The excellent catalytic reactivity
of Sn-Beta-NH2(10) could be explained based on its properties,
among which the acid–base
properties were dominant. The acid and base properties of the Beta-type
zeolites were examined by NH3- and CO2-TPD characterizations
(Figure 7A). As displayed
in Figure 7A, the weak
acid sites (below 200 °C) within the Beta zeolite decreased after
dealumination. After the incorporation of Sn species, the medium acid
sites (around at 300 °C) of the Sn-Beta zeolite were enhanced
and not apparently influenced by the following postgrafting of organoamines.17 As reported in many works in the literature,
HMF is formed as the main by-product through the dehydration of fructose
and glucose, which were both catalyzed by acid. Hence, in our work,
the sharp decrease of HMF yield upon the modification by APTMS was
speculated to be caused by the enhanced basicity. Considering this,
the base properties of the catalysts were analyzed (Figure 7B). According to the CO2-TPD profiles shown in Figure 7B, the APTMS-functionalized Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolite catalyst exhibited a new strong desorption peak located
at about 400 °C, associated with the moderate base sites at 300–600
°C,13 whereas the unmodified zeolites
possessed no basic sites obviously. These phenomena confirmed the
incorporation of basic groups (−NH2) and the resultant
basicity increase.

deAl-Beta,
(c) Sn-Beta, and (d) Sn-Beta-NH2(10).

The N content of the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst
measured
by the CHN elemental analysis was approximately 0.06 wt %, which was
similar to the theoretical value on the grounds of the dosage of APTMS,
whereas the unmodified Beta-type zeolites contained no N (Table 2). The comparison
confirmed the successful introduction of the basic groups (−NH2). For Beta and deAl-Beta catalysts, Sn was not detected,
whereas the Sn contents of the Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts measured by ICP–OES were both around 10 wt %. It
was clear that the process of organoamine postgrafting did not lead
to the dissolution of Sn species.

Pyridine-probed FT-IR (Py-IR)
analysis could identify and quantify
the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites readily. Figure 8 presents the infrared spectra of pyridine
adsorbed on the Beta zeolites at 150 °C. The bands centered at
around 1450 and 1610 cm–1 were attributed to the
Lewis acid sites, and the bands centered at 1544 and 1633 cm–1 were the characteristic of Brønsted acid sites. The absence
of bands corresponding to the Brønsted and Lewis acids for the
deAl-Beta zeolites confirmed the removal of both the acid sites during
the dealumination process, and the occurrence of Lewis acid sites
(0.47 mmol/g) of the Sn-Beta zeolites confirmed the subsequent generation
of Lewis acid sites resulting from the Sn species (Table 1). For the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst, the Lewis acid sites (0.45 mmol/g) decreased slightly
compared to the Sn-Beta zeolite, which was caused by the alkalinity
of the amine groups and the screening of Sn by the amine groups. Therefore,
it could be concluded from the acid–base characterizations
that the stability of the incorporated Sn species and the resultant
Lewis acid sites, along with the moderate basicity, contributed to
the high reactivity of Sn-Beta-NH2(10) in this work.

(d) Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts at 150 °C.

Furthermore, the structure and morphology of the
Beta-type zeolites
were also evaluated. The Sn-Beta-NH2 catalyst was synthesized
from a calcined Sn-Beta zeolite, followed by postgrafting organoamines
on the catalyst surface with silanol groups. Figure S2A shows the powder XRD pattern of the Beta, deAl-Beta, Sn-Beta,
and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts, confirming that the structure
of the commercial Beta zeolite was not notably destroyed during the
process of dealumination, SSIE, and further postgrafting method in
ethanol. It was worth mentioning that a slight amount of tin oxide
was observed for the peaks that occurred at 26°, 34°, and
51°, possibly because of the high dosage of tin(II) acetate used
during the SSIE procedure.44 The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of the APTMS-functionalized
Sn-Beta zeolite together with the other three Beta-type zeolites are
shown in Figure S2B. Typical type-I isotherms
without a sharp increase in the volume adsorbed, indicating the microporous
materials, were observed. For each Beta-type zeolite, a very small
hysteresis loop of H2 type could be seen as well. Commonly,
this loop was often found in some structurally disordered materials
with a broad distribution of pore size and an ill-defined pore shape.45 Shown in Figure S3A are the XPS spectra of the as-synthesized Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst with five main elements, including Si, C, N, Sn, and O.
The postgrafted organoamines could be further justified by the N1s XPS in Figure S3B. The peak that
was observed in the region of 399–400 eV was assigned to the
−NH2 groups. The peak at about 402 eV could be assigned
to the protonated amine groups, namely −NH3+.44Figure S4 shows the FT-IR spectra of Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolites. The Sn-Beta and Sn-Beta-NH2(10) zeolites exhibited
similar IR spectra, except for the occurrences of the band at
around 637, 1550, and 3305 cm–1, which were assigned
to the bending of N–H bonds, the −NH3+ bending, and the stretching of N–H bonds, respectively.45 Along with the results of elemental analysis,
the incorporation of −NH2 group onto Sn-Beta was
confirmed. Figure S5 shows the TEM images
of the Beta-type zeolites, confirming that the modification processes
did not destroy the structures of Beta zeolites, and it also provides
an inevitable evidence for the high dispersion of Sn species in Sn-Beta
and Sn-Beta-NH2 zeolites.

3.5 Analysis
of Catalyst Recyclability
The regeneration and reuse of the
Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst
were also examined. After each run, the catalysts were separated by
centrifugation and regenerated by washing with ethanol several times.
Although the recycled catalysts exhibited similar crystalline structure
according to their XRD patterns (Figure S6), the yield of LA decreased notably to 25% after recycling for three
runs. The decrease might be attributed to the screening of active
sites and the prevention of substrate diffusion caused by the coke
and humins attached on the surface of the catalysts and the leaching
of the amine groups, which was in accordance with the C and N contents
shown in Table S1. Notably, the surface
coke and humins of the catalysts cannot be efficiently removed even
by the hydrothermal method as mentioned in the catalytic reaction
above. Moreover, after the catalyst was calcined at the range of 300–550
°C for 3–6 h, the yield of LA was still below 25%. The
Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst exhibits a relatively bad reusability,
and more systematic studies on this issue are required.

3.6 Conversion of Other Substrates into LA
Apart from sucrose,
glucose, and fructose, some more complex carbohydrates
were also tested in our work for their potential to produce LA in
the presence of he Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalysts, including
starch, cellobiose, and cellulose. As shown in Figure 9, when lactose, starch, cellobiose, and cellulose
were used as substrates, LA yields of 28, 20, 22, and 11% were obtained,
respectively. Compared to sucrose, the LA yields obtained by these
substrates were obviously lower, which was mainly attributed to their
low hydrolysis efficiency. To improve the LA yield obtained by these
substrates, a further study about the acid–base balance of
Sn-Beta-NH2 is needed using different dosages of tin(II)
acetate and APTMS.

Figure 9 Yields of LA converted by different substrates over the
Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst. Reaction conditions: 225 mg of
substrates,
140 mg of Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst, 10 mL of H2O, 190 °C, 4 h.

4 Conclusions
In this work, Sn-Beta zeolite,
a typical Lewis acid catalyst was
modified with APTMS by a postgrafting method to achieve a high LA
yield from sucrose, which can be hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose.
For the Sn-Beta-NH2(10) catalyst, which has well-balanced
acid–base sites according to the Py-IR, NH3-TPD,
and CO2-TPD characterizations, the LA yield reached 58%
under optimized hydrothermal conditions (190 °C, 4 h) along with
only an 8% HMF yield. It was evidenced that both the Lewis acid and
base sites were essential to achieving such a high yield of LA, and
the introduction of amino groups had a significant effect on both
the promotion of sucrose hydrolysis and the suppression of the side
reaction. The results obtained using different substrates indicated
that both fructose and glucose were crucial intermediates in the initial
2 h, whereas glucose was the sole reactant after that.
