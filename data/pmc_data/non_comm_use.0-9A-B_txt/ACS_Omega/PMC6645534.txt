Four
new chiral supramolecular coordination networks of Ni(II)
of general formula [Ni2(Hhissal)2(dicarboxylate)(H2O)2]·nH2O (where
Hhissal = histidinesalicylate; dicarboxylate = adipate; n = 8 for 1, succinate; n = 4 for 2, maleate; n = 4 for 3, fumarate; and n = 6 for 4) are reported.
On the basis of the single-crystal X-ray study, an unprecedented zig-zag
chain structure of water octamer encapsulated in 1 has
been identified. The supramolecular network of the dimetal subunits
is formed through hydrogen bonding interactions between the amine
N–H of Hhissal and the oxygen atom of the coordinated water
molecule of one subunit with the uncoordinated oxygen atom and the
coordinated oxygen atom of the carboxylate group of Hhissal of the
next subunit, respectively. The strength of
hydrogen bonding within this water cluster (the range of O···O
distances is 2.702–2.760 Å) is similar to that found in
ice. These networks are further characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, powder
X-ray diffraction, polarimetry, UV–vis/diffuse reflectance
and circular dichroism spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis.
A comparison of their properties indicates that these are isostructural
with a variation of encapsulated water clusters.

Introduction
Chiral supramolecular
networks have been extensively studied in
the recent past due to their wide range of applications in asymmetric
catalysis, chiral recognition and separation, ferroelectric materials,
etc.1−7 For the synthesis of chiral networks, the use of readily available
amino acids is the best way out. Because of the presence of various
functionalities like carboxyl, amines, hydroxyl groups, etc. in amino
acids, these serve as a good candidate for the formation of hydrogen-bonded
networks. In recent years, transition metal complexes of reduced Schiff
base ligands composed of amino acids and salicylaldehyde have been
studied.8−10 Numerous coordination polymers and supramolecular
coordination networks (SCNs) of such ligands have also been reported
in the literature.11,12 Hydrogen bonding, along with
other weak interactions, like π–π and cation−π
interactions, is the significant feature of these supramolecular networks.13−18 One such ligand, H2hissal ligand (H2hissal
= histidinesalicylic acid), has been used in SCNs of several transition
metal ions such as Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), and Fe(III).19−24 This nonplanar ligand is unique with the presence of an imidazole
moiety along with a phenolic −OH group in addition to the amino
and the carboxylate groups.

On the other hand, over the last
few decades, water clusters of
different sizes are explored a lot to get insights into the aberrant
behavior of water.25−30 The structural elucidation of water clusters in diverse environments
with different nuclearities and structures gives an understanding
of the nature of water–water interactions.31 Interactions of water molecules play a pivotal role in
maintaining the stability and proper functioning of the biological
units.32−35 However, till now, many aspects of the water clusters in biological
systems, such as the water clusters in various enzymes, water channel
proteins of cell membrane, or the water structure energy-transducing
protein, are unexplored. Various theoretical calculations have been
carried out on these water clusters, giving the most stable conformations
in the gas phase for some cases with distinct nuclearity and also
expressing the properties of bulk water.36,37 For example, on the basis of such calculations, (H2O)8 should have two closely related isomers of nearly identical
energy with S4 and D2d symmetries. In both the isomers, oxygen
atoms occupy the corners of a cube and form hydrogen bonds along each
edge, but the details of their hydrogen bonding are different.38 There is an upsurge in developing and studying
new SCNs that provide suitable environments for water clusters of
different sizes through moderate to strong hydrogen bonding interactions
due to their potential application in various fields, like host–guest
chemistry, sensing, molecular recognition, etc. Experimentally, these
octameric water clusters were observed in gas-phase C6H6(H2O)8 clusters39 and in molecular beams.40 Thus far, octameric
water clusters observed in organic or organic–inorganic supramolecular
assemblies exhibit cubane,41 opened cube,42,43 and baglike conformations.44−46 In this context, a water hexamer with two dangling
monomers,47−49 a cyclic tetramer with four dangling monomers,50,51 and a cyclic ring52 have been reported
due to different environments imposed by the hosts.

In continuation
of our work in the area of unmasking water clusters
of diverse nuclearity encapsulated in the SCNs,53,54 we have chosen the Ni(II)–Hhissal system with several aliphatic
dicarboxylates as a starting point for generating examples of chiral
SCNs constructed from transition metal subunits containing reduced
Schiff base derivatives of amino acids and multitopic dicarboxylates
and water clusters. To the best of our knowledge, a dicarboxylate
linker has never been used, along with the Schiff base ligands of
amino acids (shown in Figure 1) with a metal ion, in forming an SCN. In this article, we
report the synthesis and structural characterization of four SCNs
of Ni(II) of the general formula [Ni2(Hhissal)2(dicarboxylate)(H2O)2]·nH2O (where Hhissal = histidinesalicylate; dicarboxylate
= adipate; n = 8 (1), succinate; n = 4 (2), maleate; n = 4
(3), fumarate; and n = 6 (4)). A number of analytical techniques (elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy,
powder X-ray diffraction, polarimetry, UV–vis/diffuse reflectance
and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)) have been used for their characterization and establishing
a trend in their properties. Despite our numerous efforts, suitable
crystals only for 1 were obtained for the single-crystal
X-ray structure determination. The water octamer encapsulated within 1 has a zig-zag chain structure which is unprecedented.

the chiral ligand and dicarboxylates used in this
study.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
The
synthesis of the H2hissal
ligand was carried out by modifying the procedure reported earlier.23 All four complexes 1–4 were obtained via a one-pot synthesis by stirring a methanolic
solution of NiSO4·7H2O, KHhissal, and a
dipotassium salt of the respective dicarboxylates (in a 1:1:0.5 ratio)
for 12 h at room temperature. In all four cases, the desired product
was obtained from the evaporation of the filtrate (the solid by-product
K2SO4 insoluble in methanol is the precipitate)
under reduced pressure.

Single Crystal Structure Analysis
Crystals of 1 suitable for the single-crystal X-ray
study were grown by
slow evaporation of its methanolic solution for a week. Despite numerous
attempts over a long period of time, crystals of 2–4 suitable for data collection could not be obtained. Compound 1 crystallizes in the chiral monoclinic space group C2 (Table 1). Each discrete dinuclear unit has two equivalent hexacoordinated
nickel centers with slightly distorted octahedral geometry and are
linked together by one adipate molecule (as shown in Figure 2). A 2-fold axis generates
the asymmetric unit. The coordination environment around each nickel
center is N2O4-type. The two oxygen atoms binding to Ni(II) are from the phenoxy group
and the carboxylate group of Hhissal, whereas the third oxygen binding
to Ni(II) is from the carboxylate group of the adipate and the fourth
oxygen is from the coordinated water. One nitrogen coordinating to
Ni(II) is from the NH of the amino group of the ligand, whereas the
other nitrogen is from the imidazole group of the ligand. The carboxylate
group of the ligand as well as the carboxylate group of the adipate
binds to Ni(II) in a monodentate fashion. Selected bond distances
and bond angles for 1 are listed in Tables S1 and S2, Supporting Information. In the literature,
the mononuclear complexes of the H2hissal ligand [Ni(Hhissal)2]·H2O21 as well
as [Ni(hissal)(H2O)2]47 have been reported, where the metal/ligand ratio (1:2 vs 1:1) is
different for the ligand acting as a monoanion vs a dianion, respectively.

On the basis of these two examples, it is inferred
that the deprotonation
of the phenolic −OH group depends on the intramolecular hydrogen
bonding and not on the amount of the base used. Using other neutral
or monoanionic ligands, like imidazole, SCN–, or
benzoate, three other 1:1 complexes [Ni(hissal)(imidazole)2], [Ni(Hhissal)(SCN)(H2O)]·H2O, and [Ni(Hhissal)(benzoate)(H2O)]·H2O have been reported.21,22 In the case of [Ni(Hhissal)2]·H2O, the
ligand acts as a monoanion due to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding
between the phenolic OH group and the carboxylate group of the next
molecule. On the other hand, in [Ni(Hhissal)(benzoate)(H2O)]·H2O, the intramolecular hydrogen bonding between
one of the oxygens of the benzoate group and the OH group of the ligand
is responsible for it to be a neutral species even when 2 equiv of
the base is used. In the case of 1, a similar strong
hydrogen bonding is observed between the oxygen of the carboxylate
group of the adipate and the phenolic −OH (O···O
distance: 2.585 Å), and thus preventing deprotonation of the
phenolic −OH despite the use of 2 equiv of base (see Figure 2).

The dimeric
unit grows in one direction forming a two-dimensional
(2D) sheetlike structure via intermolecular hydrogen bonding. The
nitrogen of the amine of the ligand and the oxygen atom of the coordinated
water molecule of the dinuclear subunit are hydrogen-bonded to the
uncoordinated oxygen atom and the coordinated oxygen atom of the carboxylate
group of the ligand of the next subunit, respectively, forming a ladderlike
structure (as shown in Figure 3). This 2D sheet is further hydrogen-bonded to a similar 2D
sheet via hydrogen bonding, giving a three-dimensional (3D) network
of intermingled ladders (as shown in Figure 4).

Figure 3 Two-dimensional sheet forming a ladderlike structure
in 1 via hydrogen bonding interactions (intramolecular
hydrogen bonding
is shown in orange, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding is shown in
violet).

Figure 4 Intermingled ladders in 1 forming
a 3D structure via
hydrogen bonding interactions.

The −NH of the imidazole ring of the ligand of the
first
2D sheet shows bifurcated hydrogen bonding with the oxygen atom (O6)
of the coordinated water and the uncoordinated oxygen atom (O2) of
the carboxylate group forming intermingled ladders (as shown in Figure S1). On each side of the ladder, the octameric
chain of water was strongly hydrogen-bonded to the dimeric unit (as
shown in Figure 5,
top). While doing so, the lattice water octamer (O7, O7′, O8,
O8′, O9, O9′, O10, and O10′) present in the molecule
arranges itself in the form of a 1D zig-zag chain via intermolecular
hydrogen bonding. The six water molecules (two O8, two O9, and two
O10) form the backbone of this chain, whereas two water molecules
(two O7) are just attached to this backbone (as shown in Figure 5, bottom). The octamer
of water in 1 shows strong intermolecular as well as
intramolecular hydrogen bonding.25,55−58 The hydrogen-bonding parameters found in 1 are summarized
in Table 2. The dinuclear
units are strongly hydrogen-bonded to octameric water chains on both
the ends (as shown in Figure S2). Therefore,
it is observed that the octameric chain of water is encapsulated between
the hydrogen-bonded 2D sheets of the dimeric units of 1 through strong hydrogen bonding (as shown in Figure 6). In 1, the O···O
distance varies from 2.6620 to 2.7492 Å; these parameters are
comparable to those for ice, where the O···O distance
is 2.783 Å25,48,49 and the O···O···O angles vary from
96.64 to 152.09°. This arrangement enhances the stability of
the water chain as evident from the thermal behavior of 1 (vide infra). Even though this chain grows infinitely, there are
eight water molecules that are traversed every time to reach the unit
cell repeat atom. In all previously reported infinite water chains
with octamer as a repeating unit, there are one or more rings, whereas
in this case, the whole unit (octamer) is a chain with no rings. This
octamer can be classified as C8.57,58 Prior to our work, all reports describing the structure of water
octamer have different arrangements. For example, theoretical studies
suggested that the water octamer of cubelike arrangement with D2d and S4 symmetries would be the most favorable,39,40,59 whereas the first crystallographic observation
of the water octamer was reported for [A2B](H2O)8, where A = κ4-[1,2-bis(2-oxy-2-methylpropanamido)-4,5dimethoxybenzene]cobaltate(III)
and B = bis-κ3-(2,6-diacetamidopyridine)cobalt(II),
in which the water octamer forms a cubelike structure with Ci symmetry.41 In
this structure, O···O···O angles vary
from 79.9 to 92.1°, whereas O···O distances vary
from 2.750 to 2.929 Å. Similarly, in the case of [Y(dpdo)2(H2O)4][Co(CN)6]·4H2O (where dpdo = 2,2′-dipyridine dioxide), the octameric
water cluster has a book-shaped hexamer with two dangling water molecules,47 where the O···O distances within
the octamer vary from 2.677 to 2.964 Å and O···O···O
angles range from 79.4 to 105.7°. Another puckered water octamer
is known in the literature52 in which the
O···O distance is 2.745 Å and the O···O···O
angles are 109.5 and 116°. Finally, in [{V(phen)2SO4}2O](H2O)4 (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline),
the water octamer42 shows a butterfly-shaped
or opened cubelike structure, where O···O distances
within the octamer range from 2.76 to 2.91 Å. Thus, an encapsulated
zig-zag water octamer chain found in 1 is unprecedented.

Powder X-ray Data Analysis
Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns (intensity vs 2θ) were recorded for the bulk samples
of 1–4 at room temperature (as shown
in Figure S3). In the case of 1, the experimental and simulated (from the single-crystal data) patterns
matched very well, confirming that the single crystal and bulk material
are the same. This also confirms the phase purity of bulk. The patterns
for 2–4 show their crystalline nature.
The powder X-ray diffraction of 2–4 shows
a similar pattern as that with a slight variation in some peaks, suggesting
a small variation in the crystal structure compared to that of 1.

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
IR spectra of 1–4 (see Figures S4–S7) recorded in the solid state
as KBr pellets show two broad bands in the region of 3400–3200
cm–1. For compound 1, the broad peak
at 3380 cm–1 is for H-bonded phenolic-OH. For 2, 3, and 4, the corresponding peaks
appear at 3375, 3384, and 3381 cm–1, respectively.
On the other hand, the peaks at 3251, 3227, 3250, and 3263 cm–1, respectively, for 1–4 are for the water molecules. Generally, the IR spectrum of ice shows
the O–H stretching frequency at 3220 cm–1.60 This corroborates well with the O···O
distances found in the crystal structure of 1, which
are similar to those found in ice. For N–H stretching, the
peak for 1 appears at 3008 cm–1, for 2 at 3017 cm–1, for 3 at 3023
cm–1, and for 4 at 2984 cm–1. The asymmetric stretch for the carboxylate group of the ligand
appears at around 1592 cm–1 for 1,
1600 cm–1 for 2, 1598 cm–1 for 3, and 1598 cm–1 for 4, whereas the symmetric stretch appears at 1480 cm–1 for 1, 1481 cm–1 for 2, 1480 cm–1 for 3, and 1480 cm–1 for 4. The asymmetric stretch for the
dicarboxylates appears at 1567 cm–1 for 1, 1568 cm–1 for 2, 1574 cm–1 for 3, and 1576 cm–1 for 4, whereas the symmetric stretch appears at 1406 cm–1 for 1, 1397 cm–1 for 2, 1401 cm–1 for 3, and 1404 cm–1 for 4. In all four compounds, the C–O
stretching for the phenoxo part of the ligand appears at around 1294
cm–1.61 This comparative
data indicates that all four compounds are isostructural.

Solid-State
Diffuse Reflectance
The diffuse reflectance
spectra of 1–4 (as shown in Figure 7) are dominated by
the d–d transitions of Ni(II). In all complexes, three absorption
edges are observed: 271, 370, and 575 nm (for 1); 281,
376, and 603 nm (for 2); 296, 374, and 603 nm (for 3); and 295, 372, and 593 nm (for 4). The absorption
edges at ∼600 and ∼370 nm can be assigned to the following
transitions of Ni(II) in a distorted octahedral environment: 2A2g to 2T1g (F) and 2A2g to 2T1g (P), respectively.

Figure 7 Reflectance
spectra for 1–4 in
the wavelength range from 200 to 1100 nm.

UV–Vis and Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
UV–visible
and CD studies were carried out using a 1.25 mM
methanolic solution of 1–4. In the
visible region of the spectrum (325–700 nm), 1 shows a major peak at 590 nm (ε = 79 L mol–1 cm–1) and a hump at 365 nm. For other complexes,
corresponding peaks appear as follows: for 2, 599 nm
(ε = 65 L mol–1 cm–1) and
355 nm; for 3, 590 nm (ε = 73 L mol–1 cm–1) and 350 nm, and for 4, 590
nm (ε = 80 L mol–1 cm–1)
and 350 nm (as shown in Figure 8a). These values are similar to the values reported in the
literature for similar compounds.21

Figure 8 (a) UV–vis
spectra and (b) CD spectra for 1–4 in the wavelength range from 325 to 700 nm.

All of the above-mentioned peaks are due to d–d transitions.
The peaks at around 600 nm are due to the 2A2g to 2T1g (F) transition in Ni(II), whereas
the humps at around 360 nm are due to the 2A2g to 2T1g (P) transition.62 In the CD spectrum of 1, in the wavelength
range of 325–700 nm, the positive Cotton effect is observed
at 389 nm (due to 2A2g to 2T1g (P) transitions) and 567 nm (due to 2A2g to 2T1g (F) transitions). The corresponding
peaks for other complexes are as follows: for 2, at 391
and 576 nm; for 3, at 389 and 565 nm; and for 4, at 390 and 567 nm (Figure 8b). The negative Cotton effect for 1 is observed
at 353 and 504 nm. The corresponding peaks for other complexes are
as follows: for 2, at 343 and 509 nm; for 3, at 354 and 509 nm; and for 4, at 352 and 512 nm.63

In the UV region of the spectrum (200–325
nm), the peaks
at 205 nm (π–π*) and a shoulder at around 245 nm
are due to the l-histidine part of the ligand and at 290
nm (n−π*) due to the salicylaldehyde part of the ligand
(as shown in Figure 9a). In the CD spectrum of 1 in wavelength range of 200–325
nm, the positive Cotton effect is observed at 234 and 270 nm. The
corresponding peaks for other complexes are observed: 234 and 271
nm (for 2); 233 and 270 nm (for 3); and
230 and 272 nm (for 4). The negative Cotton effect for 1 is observed at 210, 258, and 289 nm. The corresponding peaks
for other complexes are observed: at 208, 258, and 289 nm (for 2); 211, 258, and 289 nm (for 3); and 210, 258,
and 290 nm (for 4) (as shown in Figure 9b). The solution-state UV–vis absorption
spectra of all four complexes 1–4 show a striking similarity with their solid-state reflectance spectra,
suggesting the integrity of the solid-state structure in the solution.

spectra and (b) CD spectra of 1–4 in the wavelength range from 200 to 325 nm.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The presence of an imidazole
group in the H2hissal ligand makes it a fluorophore. On
being excited at 250 nm, the emission maximum is obtained at 307 nm
for the ligand. However, in the case of all of the SCNs (1–4) synthesized using this ligand, quenching is observed in the fluorescence
(as shown in Figure 10). A nonradiative decay caused by a Dexter-type energy transfer between
the orbitals of Ni(II) and the Hhissal ligand is responsible for such
quenching. Apart from this, another λemi peak at
284 is observed in the case of the SCNs (1–4). In the case of 2, two additional peaks at
343 and 358 nm are observed in the emission spectrum, indicating the
variation in the structure of the succinate analogue from the other
analogues and thus also confirming a different nonradiative pathway
in the case of 2 compared to that in 1, 3, and 4.

Thermogravimetric Analyses
The thermal stability of
compounds 1–4 was studied as a function
of temperature in the range of 25–500 °C (see Figures S8–S11, respectively). Each of
the SCN shows a three-step weight-loss profile. In each case, the
first step shows a loss of the lattice water molecule and the second
step shows a loss of mainly the coordinated water molecule and the
carbon dioxide molecules. In the case of 1 and 4, the loss of remaining two lattice water molecules also
takes place in this step, clearly suggesting an increase in the hydrogen
bonding in the case of these two lattice water molecules compared
to that in their other counterparts within the octamer (vide supra).
This is further confirmed from the single crystal X-ray diffraction
structure of 1. In the third step, further degradation
of the complex is observed in all of the cases. The detailed TGA of 1 is reported herein as an example: the first weight loss
of 11.24% between 50 and 160 °C corresponds to the loss of six
lattice water molecules (ca. 11.22%). The second step has a weight
loss of 21.89% between 260 and 360 °C for the loss of two lattice
water molecules, two coordinated water molecules, and three carbon
dioxide molecules (ca. 21.20%). The third weight loss of 57.60% between
370 and 470 °C indicates a further loss of the metal–ligand
complex (ca. 56.27%). The TGA of 2–4 is reported in the Supporting Information. The TGA described above for 1–4 not only shows the strength of hydrogen bonding of lattice water
molecules with the dinickel subunits but also supports the findings
of other characterization techniques. The unusual thermal stability
of these SCNs can be attributed to the extensive hydrogen bonding
of the respective water cluster with the dimetal subunits.

Conclusions
In this article, the chainlike structure of the water octamer encapsulated
in the 2D sheet structure of the dinuclear subunits in [Ni2(Hhissal)2(adi)(H2O)2]·8H2O (1) is described in detail based on the single-crystal
X-ray structural studies. The encapsulated water octamer having hydrogen
bonding within itself as well as with the carboxylate group of the ligand in the dinuclear unit provides
greater stability to 1. Further spectroscopic properties
and thermal behavior established for 1 provide additional
information for understanding such a system. A comparison of these
properties of 1 with those of [Ni2(Hhissal)2(succ)(H2O)2]·4H2O (2) and [Ni2(Hhissal)2(mal)(H2O)2]·4H2O (3), and [Ni2(Hhissal)2(fum)(H2O)2]·6H2O (4) has indicated that these are isostructural
with a variation of encapsulated water molecules. The current study
may provide a deeper insight into the hydrogen-bonding motif of the
aqueous environments in biological systems and help in better understanding
of the proton conduction in various living organisms. Results obtained
in this study have encouraged us to put more effort in this direction
with other metal centers as well as several dicarboxylate ligands
to illuminate the rich chemistry for such systems. Further details
will be communicated in due course.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
All reactions reported in this
work were carried out under aerobic conditions using chemicals and
solvents from commercial sources without further purification. The
H2hissal ligand was made by modifying a literature procedure.23 However, its synthesis and characterization
are reported in the Supporting Information.

Physical Measurements
The 1H NMR spectrum
of the Na2hissal ligand was recorded in D2O
solution at 25 °C on a Bruker ARX-400 spectrometer (chemical
shifts are referenced to the residual solvent signals). Elemental
analysis (C, H, N) of all compounds was done using a Leco TruSpec
CHNS analyzer. For all samples, thermogravimetric analysis was carried
out using Shimadzu DTG-60H from 25 to 500 °C (heating rate of
10 °C min–1) under a dinitrogen atmosphere.
IR spectra of samples prepared as KBr pellets were recorded in the
4000–400 cm–1 range on a Perkin-Elmer spectrum
I spectrometer. The UV–vis spectrum of a methanolic solution
of each compound (typical concentration: 1 mM) was recorded in a Cary
60 UV–Vis spectrophotometer using a cuvette of path length
1 cm. Solid-state diffuse reflectance spectra were measured in a Cary
5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer by Agilent Technology.
Optical rotations were measured using a glass cell with 50 mm path
length in an Anton Paar modular circular polarimeter (MCP 300). Using
a 2 mm path length quartz cuvette, CD spectra of all compounds were
recorded on a Chirascan spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics,
Leatherhead, Surrey, U.K.). Fluorescence spectra were recorded using
a Shimadzu RF5301PC fluorescence spectrophotometer.

Synthesis of
[Ni2(Hhissal)2(adi)(H2O)2]·8H2O (1)
In a 10 mL round
bottom flask, 47 mg (0.18 mmol) of NiSO4·7H2O was dissolved in 3 mL of methanol. To this,
a clear mixture of monopotassium H2hissal (KHhissal) (which
was prepared using 50 mg (0.18 mmol) of H2hissal and 10
mg (0.18 mmol) of potassium hydroxide in 2.5 mL of methanol) and dipotassium
adipate (K2adi) (which was prepared using 13 mg (0.09 mmol)
of adipic acid and 10 mg (0.18 mmol) of potassium hydroxide in 2.5
mL of methanol) was added to get a blue color. This was stirred for
12 h. A blue solution was collected via filtration and evaporated
under reduced pressure to obtain a blue powder. Yield: 70 mg (75.7%).

Single-Crystal X-ray Structure Determination
As described
before,53 crystals of 1 were
evaluated and data were collected on a Kappa APEX II diffractometer
using the APEX2 program.55 Data were processed
for routine steps: integration by the SAINT55 program, corrections for Lorentz and polarization effects, an absorption
correction (SADABS), determination of space group, and generation
of files necessary for solution and refinement by subroutine XPREP.55 For structure solution of 1 and
further refinement, SHELXTL and SHELXL subroutines56 embedded in APEX2 were used. In 1, all nonhydrogen
atoms, except oxygen atoms of uncoordinated water molecules, were
refined with anisotropic displacement parameters. Crystal data and
structure refinement parameters for 1 are listed in Table 1. All figures were
generated using MERCURY V 3.0.57 Hydrogen-bonding
parameters were obtained from PLATON.64

Powder X-ray Studies
In each case, using a Rigaku Ultima
IV diffractometer (for details, refer to the report previously communicated
by this laboratory54), data were collected
of a fine powder, which was prepared by a mortar and a pestle and
was placed on a glass sample holder, over a 2θ range of 3–50°
with a scanning speed of 1° per min with 0.02° step.
