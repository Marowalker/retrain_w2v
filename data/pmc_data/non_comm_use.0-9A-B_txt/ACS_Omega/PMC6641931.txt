Porous carbon derived from rice hulls
has potential for application
in phosphorus–carbon composites as high capacity anode materials
for lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. The native composition of
rice husks produces a porous carbon with a unique doped structure,
as well as an efficient pore and channel structure, which may facilitate
high and stable lithium storage. After cycling for over 100 cycles,
the composite delivered a capacity of about 1293 mAh g–1, as well as a coulombic efficiency of nearly 99% at the current
density of 130 mA g–1 with a capacity density of
1.43 mAh cm–2. High specific discharge capacities
were maintained at different current densities (∼2224, ∼1895,
∼1642, and ∼1187 mAh g–1composite at 130, 260, 520, and 1300 mA g–1, respectively).
This study may offer a golden opportunity to change the humble fate
of rice hulls, and also pave the way toward successful battery application
for phosphorus–carbon composite anode materials.

Introduction
In the last 5 years,
red phosphorus has been considered as a candidate
for anode materials because of its high theoretical capacity (2600
mAh g–1).1,2 Nevertheless, the application
of red phosphorus faces serious challenges due to its electronic insulation
and 300% volume expansion after lithiation.3 A three-dimensional phosphorus–carbon composite structure,
in which the red phosphorus nanoparticles are well-dispersed and buffered
in a porous carbon matrix, is an effective solution to overcome these
barriers.4−7 When used as a buffer and conductive matrix, porous carbons are
considered to be promising due to their advantages in cost, resource,
rich pore structure diversity, high pore volume, tunable surface chemistry,
outstanding chemical stability, and high electrical conductivity.8 Presently, various polymeric precursors have
been used in the preparation of activated carbons, such as resorcinol–formaldehyde
resin,9 polypyrrole,10 polyacrylonitrile,11 and dopamine.12 However, poisonous and costly precursors, and
the sophisticated equipment required have thoroughly hindered their
mass production.

Biomass is rich in carbon and the water channels
and inorganic
salts contained within it form inherent but fine structures. Meanwhile,
the basic elements in biomass, including nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon,
etc., provide diverse availability for self-doping porous carbon (SDC).13 Rice hulls are an agriculture waste and are
traditionally used as forage. Recent research has shown that rice
hulls are rich in silicon and nitrogen, and comprise perfectly piled
nanotubes, whose structure would be an ideal host matrix for composite
materials.14,15

In this study, an SDC made
from rice hulls is used to prepare red
phosphorus–carbon composites. The lithium storage behaviors
of the composites are appraised, and the contribution of the SDC structural
characteristics and nitrogen- and silicon-doped elements in the porous
carbon toward the electrochemical performance is discussed. The results
pave an applicable way to obtaining high performance electrode materials
for batteries.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 depicts
the SEM images of pristine rice hulls and the prepared SDC. As shown
in Figure 1b–d,
after calcination and activation, the architecture of the carbon changes
to irregular sheets, which are composed of large numbers of lamellas.
The carbon shows a smooth surface and pores are visible in the SEM
images (Figure 1d);
these pores may form during the pyrolysis of the rice hulls and the
subsequent activation process.16 After
compaction, the conductivity of the SDC at room temperature is higher
than 3.12 × 10–3 S cm–1,
making it suitable as a matrix. Notably, many mesopores and micropores
act as channels inside the flakes and even interconnect, which is
conducive to the spread of red phosphorus into the internal micropores.
Additionally, elemental mapping demonstrates that nitrogen and silicon
are finely dispersed in the carbon matrix after carbonization (inset
in Figure 1b).

XPS is a powerful tool for obtaining
an elemental survey and for
chemical state determination.17−19 As shown in Figure 2, the XPS survey spectrum indicates
the presence of the principal elements C 1s, O 1s, N 1s, and Si 2p
(Figure 2a), and the
atomic percentage of these elements can be calculated as 83.36, 12.17,
1.84, and 2.63%, respectively (Table 1). To understand their chemical states, the high-resolution
Si 2p, N 1s, and O 1s peaks were fitted using the Gaussian program,
and the results are displayed in Figure 2b–d. As depicted in Figure 2b, the two Si 2p peaks are
located at 103.5 and 104.4 eV, respectively, and can be related to
Si–O bonds.20,21 The N 1s spectrum (Figure 2c) is divided into four individual
peaks centered at 398.5, 400.2, 401.3, and 404.6 eV, corresponding
to pyridinic-N, pyrrolic/pyridone-N, quaternary-N, and pyridine-N-oxide, respectively.22−25 Due to the approximate bond lengths
of C–C and C–N, pyridinic-N and quaternary-N can have
a slight influence on the carbon matrix structure.26 Further, the structure of carbon can be disrupted by sp3-bonded pyrrolic-N. In addition, the configuration of pyridinic-N
is the most stable under the circumstance of monovacancy; however,
pyridinic-N and quaternary-N predominate in the case of divacancy
and Stone–Wales defects.27−29 Because the electronegativity
of nitrogen is much larger than that of carbon, it generates polarization
in the carbon matrix network, which affects the electronic properties
of the carbon matrix.30 Therefore, N doping
can effectually improve electron transfer and benefit the conductivity
of carbon materials.16,31 The O 1s spectrum, as shown in Figure 2d, exhibits two dominating
peaks at 532.5 and 533.4 eV, which may reflect C=O/C–O
and Si–O bonds.32,33

The porosity features
of SDC were investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm measurements (Figure 3a,b). It is clear that SDC
shows a typical IV-type sorption isotherm, which is indicative of
a hierarchical porous structure. Specifically, a sharp rise is found
at low relatively pressures (P/P0 < 0.01), suggesting the presence of a certain amount
of micropores. Simultaneously, a hysteresis loop from P/P0 = 0.55 to 0.85 can be observed, implying
the existence of mesopores in the carbon.34−36 The pore size
distribution of SDC also exhibits the same results (Figure 3b) and was calculated by the
quenched solid density functional theory kernel. The micropore peak
of the SDC is centered at 0.58 nm with a range of 0.5–2 nm,
while the mesopore pore width averaged 2.75 nm (inset in Figure 3b). Furthermore,
the specific surface area and total pore volume of the SDC are 934.7
m2 g–1 and 0.44 cm3 g–1, respectively.

Figure 3 (a) Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms and (b) pore
size distribution of SDC.

Red phosphorus–carbon composites were prepared by
a vaporization/adsorption
process. The sublimated red phosphorus spread into the pores by capillary
forces and relative pressure, and it was consequently deposited and
adsorbed on the inner surface of the hierarchical porous SDC.

The XRD patterns of red phosphorus, SDC, and the phosphorus–SDC
composite are shown in Figure 4a. Red phosphorus is amorphous and its XRD pattern is dominated
by three broad humps at 11–18, 26–38, and 47–65°.37,38 The two broad peaks of SDC at approximately 23 and 44° can
be ascribed to the (002) and (100) reflections of the disordered carbon
layer. In the XRD pattern of the red phosphorus–SDC composite,
the red phosphorus peaks are weaker, indicating that the phosphorus
spread to the inner surface of the SDC. In contrast, the broad diffraction
peaks of the composite indicate its amorphous structure and even distribution.
This trend is further demonstrated by the elemental mapping in Figure 4b. Obviously, the
phosphorus map reflects the morphology of the carbon matrix. This
confirms the homogeneous distribution of phosphorus and carbon in
the composite.38

phosphorus, self-doped carbon (SDC), and
red phosphorus–SDC composite; (b) SEM image of the composite
and element mapping of phosphorus.

The BET surface area and pore size distribution of the phosphorus–SDC
composite were also measured and the results are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. Table 2 shows the comparison
of the specific surface area and pore volume of SDC and the composite.
Using the pore volume of SDC and the density of red phosphorus (2.2
g cm–3), the ratio of phosphorus in the composites
was calculated to be approximately 49.18 wt %. Actually, the thermogravimetric
analysis of the composite revealed that the content of phosphorus
was ∼42 wt %. Considering the fact that some phosphorus would
be unable to desorb due to the formation of a P–C bond,36 this value is reasonable.

The electrochemical
behaviors of the phosphorus–SDC composite
were evaluated by galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements,
as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a shows
the typical charge–discharge curves of the composite electrode
in the range of 0.001–2 V versus Li/Li+ at a rate
of 130 mA g–1. Two characteristic regions can be
observed in the first discharge curve of the phosphorus–SDC
composite: (1) a large slope in the discharge capacity range from
∼100 to ∼600 mAh g–1composite (region I in Figure 5a); (2) a subsequent plateau in the discharge capacity range from
∼600 to ∼2300 mAh g–1composite (region II in Figure 5a).39,40 Only one plateau centered at around 1.0
V versus Li/Li+ can be observed in the charge profile.
In subsequent charge–discharge processes, only one discharge
plateau and one charge plateau can be observed. The differential capacity
plots (DCPs) of the composite clearly reflect these observations,
as shown in Figure 5b. The broad peak at 1.10 V versus Li/Li+ during the first
discharge (region I in Figure 5b) is not found in the following discharge process, this is
most probably from the reaction of the catalyst.41 The cathodic peak at 0.8–0.5 V versus Li/Li+ corresponds to a stepwise formation of Li3P.42 The cycling performance of the phosphorus–SDC
composite was investigated at a current density of 130 mA g–1 and is shown in Figure 5c. The discharge capacity gradually dropped to 1940 mAh g–1composite after 10 cycles, while the coulombic
efficiency dramatically soared to ∼99% from the initial coulombic
efficiency (77%). After prolonging cycling over 100 cycles, the capacity
of the phosphorus–SDC composite was found to be 1293 mAh g–1composite (1.43 mAh cm–2), which relates to 58% capacity retention relative to the second-cycle
capacity of 2241 mAh g–1composite. Actually,
the inherently high surface area of the carbon matrix leads to large
quantities of a solid electrolyte interphase being formed and large
irreversible capacity loss during the initial few cycles. For exactly
this reason, the initial coulombic efficiency of the phosphorus–SDC
composite is lower than 80% and capacity fading is observed. We also
evaluated the rate performance of the phosphorus–SDC composite
anode with C-rates from 130 to 1300 mA g–1, as shown
in Figure 5d. As the
current density increased, specific capacities of ∼2224, ∼1895,
∼1642, and ∼1187 mAh g–1composite were obtained at 130, 260, 520, and 1300 mA g–1, respectively. When the rate was restored to 130 mA g–1 after 25 cycles of rate testing, the specific capacity returned
to 1875 mAh g–1composite, approaching
the initial capacity at 260 mA g–1 (1895 mAh g–1composite). This confirms that the charge/discharge
of the phosphorus–SDC composite is still reversible even at
high current density. The excellent electrochemical performance can
be explained by the improved conductivity of the composite due to
the incorporation of the highly conductive self-doped carbon, which
allowed the lithium ions to have relatively convenient transmission
paths. Furthermore, the N doping plays a pivotal role in improving
the capacity and stability of composites.19,43−45 However, the effect of silicon on the electrochemical
performance of phosphorus is still unknown. To demonstrate the role
of silicon, we undertook further studies using a phosphorous electrode
with trace amounts of silicon.

composite; (b) DCPs of the phosphorus–SDC composite; (c) cycle
stability and coulombic efficiency of the phosphorus–SDC composite
at a current density of 130 mA g–1; (d) rate capability
of the phosphorus–SDC composites.

Figure 6 shows
the
electrochemical performance comparison of pure phosphorus and phosphorus
with trace amounts of silicon (PWS). The initial discharge capacity
of pure phosphorus is higher than the capacity of PWS whereas the
first charge capacity and following discharge capacity are much less
than those of PWS. Additionally, there are some discharge platforms
in the low voltage range (the blue box in Figure 6). All of these phenomena indicate that silicon
has a certain influence on the electrochemical performance of phosphorus.
Hence, the silicon self-doped in carbon is also conducive to improving
the electrochemical performance of phosphorus.

Conclusions
Self-doped carbon (SDC) derived from rice hulls
inherits a subtle
natural structure in terms of high porosity, high special surface
area, and suitable elemental doping (silicon and nitrogen). The phosphorus–SDC
composite shows high specific capacity, excellent rate capability,
and stable long-term cycling performance. More specifically, the composite
exhibits a reversible capacity of 1293 mAh g–1composite after 100 cycles, and the capacity retention is 58%
based on the second lithiation. As the current density switches abruptly
from 1300 back to 260 mA g–1, the original capacity
is almost recovered (∼99%), indicating the stability of the
composite electrode. The simple, green, and economic carbon matrix
introduced in this work provides a sustainable way to develop advanced
materials.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
The collected rice hulls
were washed several
times using deionized water and were then immersed in 1 M HNO3 for 4 h. The rice hulls were then washed again three times
with deionized water and dried at 105 °C for 12 h. After that,
the dried rice hulls were carbonized at 600 °C for 4 h with a
rate of 1 °C min–1 under an inert atmosphere.
The carbonized material was then placed in an aqueous KOH solution.
After evaporation of water at 105 °C, the collected materials
were heated at 800 °C for 1 h with a ramp rate of 3 °C min–1. The collected products were thoroughly cleaned by
0.5 M HCl and deionized water and then dried at 110 °C for 12
h. The final samples were named SDC.

Subsequently, red phosphorus
was placed in a stainless steel vessel and SDC was spread on a crucible,
which was set in the vessel. The vessel was filled with pure argon
and sealed. After heating the vessel at 450 °C for 3 h and cooling
to room temperature, the phosphorus–SDC composite was obtained.

Characterization
XRD analysis was undertaken with a
Rigaku D/max-2500 (Cu Kα radiation). The morphology of the red
phosphorus–SDC composite was characterized by a JEOL-6301F.
The special surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution
were obtained by N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms
using a Quantachrome analyzer (NOVA 2200) at −196 °C.

Electrochemical Characterization
The working electrodes
were prepared by combining 70 wt % red phosphorus composite, 20 wt
% acetylene black, and 10 wt % polyacrylonitrile and pressing a 0.8
cm2 thin film onto a Ni mesh. Then, the electrodes were
dried at 80 °C for 12 h in a vacuum oven. Electrochemical cells
(CR2032coin-type cells) were assembled with the phosphorus–SDC
composite cathode, lithium metal anode, and Celgard2400 separator.
A mixed solution of 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in ethylene carbonate,
dimethyl carbonate, and ethyl methyl carbonate (1:1:1) was used as
the electrolyte in this work. Charge–discharge cycles were
carried out galvanostatically with a current density of 130 mA g–1 in the range of 0.001–2 V on a Land CT2001A.
All electrochemical performances were tested at room temperature.
