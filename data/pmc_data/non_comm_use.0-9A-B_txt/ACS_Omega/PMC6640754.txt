To investigate soap formation in
drying oils in historic paints,
the reaction between metal acetates (K+, Zn2+, Pb2+) and ethyl linoleate (EL) was studied using optical
microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, and electron microscopy. Pb(II)
and Zn(II) react rapidly with EL to form highly structured, spherulitic,
luminescent crystallites that aggregate. Evidence from Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive
X-ray analysis and high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction
indicates that these are organic–inorganic hybrid complexes
or coordination polymers. FTIR absorbance peaks at ca. 1540 cm–1 for Pb(II) and ca. 1580 cm–1 for
Zn(II) are consistent with the formation of carboxylate complexes.
The complexes formed offer insight into the degradation processes
observed in oil paint films, suggesting that soap formation is rapid
when metal ions are solubilized and can occur with unsaturated fatty
acids that are present in fresh oils. These complexes may account
for the atypical luminescence observed in lead-containing cured oil
paint films.

Introduction
Properly formulated, cured oil paint films
are remarkably stable
natural polymer systems, lasting hundreds of years. Lead-containing
paints, made from lead white (Pb(OH)2·2PbCO3) or red lead (Pb3O4), have noteworthy stability.
Despite their longevity, the propensity of lead-containing oil paints
to form “soaps”, generally defined as the metal salts
of fatty acids, which arise from reaction with free fatty acids in
the oil medium is well known. Soap formation has been most closely
associated with zinc- and lead-containing pigments, although it occurs
with other metal ions in paints, such as copper or calcium. Formation
of zinc soaps has long been blamed for the brittleness of zinc white
paint.1 Salt “soaps” can
result in a variety of other problems in paintings: these include
formation of aggregates that can protrude through the painted surface
as whitish “pustules” and an increase in transparency
of the oil paint film.2,3 Analysis of the pustules indicates
that they are primarily composed of salts of palmitic and stearic
acids and a smaller proportion of oleic acid.4,5 Delamination
of paint layers, often associated with zinc soap formation, may occur.6,7 Recent work has shown that a variety of zinc alkanoates with sheet
structures can form in oil, which might account for this phenomenon.8

Considerable research is being undertaken
to characterize and understand
the mechanism and rate of “soap” formation in oil paint
films.9,10 However, debate remains over whether it
is a long-term, slow reaction, and is therefore possibly preventable,
or it occurs early in the curing process, and if so, what are the
factors that initiate the reactions to form soaps. To investigate
these questions, we set out to understand the time frame of lead and
zinc carboxylate formation through a competition experiment between
the oligomerization of oil and the salt formation pathways.

Ethyl linoleate (EL), 9,12-linoleic (9,12-octadecadienoic(Z,Z)acid-,
ethyl ester), has been shown to be an appropriate model to study the
curing of linseed and other natural drying oils;11 therefore, we used EL to simplify the study of the curing
reaction in the presence of metal ions. Potassium, lead, and zinc
acetates were used to add quantifiable amounts of soluble metal ions
found in pigments and driers to the model system. This model is different
from others that have been used for studying soap formation as the
fatty acid is polyunsaturated.

Reaction of methanolic solutions
of EL and Mn+(CH3COO)n [M = Pb2+, Zn2+] in air
on quartz plates resulted in both
oxidation of EL and formation of discrete spherulites within hours.
These are colorless, ordered structures that luminesce in the visible
region upon near-UV/visible irradiation. Their properties suggest
that they may be thought of as hybrid inorganic–organic complexes
or coordination polymers, which contain both inorganic and organic
moieties bonded into a network with long-range connectivity in at
least one dimension.12 In particular, the
complexes described here seem to be similar to those described in
the reports of lead(II) alkanoates and zinc(II) carboxylates, which
are two-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) framework complexes.13 This article presents preliminary characterization
of the structural and luminescence properties of Pb(II)–EL
and Zn(II)–EL complexes and briefly discusses the possible
importance of these findings to understanding the preservation state
of oil paintings.

Experimental Section
EL (Sigma-Aldrich,
1 g ampules), Zn(CH3COO)2 (Aldrich, 99.99%),
K(CH3COO) (Sigma), and Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O (Mallinckrodt) were used as
received. Mixtures of EL and metal acetates (M = Pb2+,
K+, and Zn2+) in methanol (Fisher, Analytical
Grade) were made up under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen or argon.
The gases were purified by passage through columns of BASF R3-11 catalyst
and 4 Å molecular sieves. Samples of metal acetates in approximately
0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mole ratios to EL were prepared under N2(g). Metal acetate samples were weighed and transferred into a dry
box. In the dry box, 45.5 μL of EL was measured and added to
vials containing the weighed metal acetate, which were then capped,
sealed, and kept in the freezer until use. The mixtures were taken
up in a minimum amount of dry CH3OH (<0.5 mL), and in
air, the solution was placed dropwise onto quartz plates. After only
a few minutes, the clear solution became cloudy and bubbles evolved.
The resulting films were allowed to cure in air overnight and then
monitored using the methods described below. All analyses of the products
except the X-ray powder diffraction measurements were recorded in
situ in the film on quartz plates.
This means that in most cases the spectra obtained are a combination
of those from the EL film and the metal-containing product.

Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
spectra were recorded using a Nexus 670 FTIR bench with a SpectraTech
Continuμm microscope (Thermo Nicolet) equipped with a 15×
ATR objective with a silicon crystal slide-on attachment. Spectra
were collected at 8 cm–1 resolution, 256 scans were
integrated, and the sample area was 100 μm × 100 μm.
Spectral analysis was performed using OMNIC software. Transmission
and luminescence spectra of EL–metal acetate mixtures curing
on spectral grade quartz plates (Wilmad) were obtained. Absorbance
spectra were acquired using a Cary 1G UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Varian/Agilent Technologies) between 200 and 800 nm; the analysis
of the spectra was carried out using Cary Win UV software. Macroscale
luminescence spectra were obtained using a Fluorolog FL3-22 spectrofluorometer
(Horiba Jobin Yvon) equipped with external fiber optic cables to collect
emission and excitation–emission spectra of the films on the
plates. A standard experiment used λex = 250–600
nm with 25 nm steps and 5 nm slit width and acquired λem between 300 and 800 nm with 2 nm steps and 5 nm slit width. Measurements
at the microscopic scale were made using a Craic XDi 100 microspectrophotometer
(CRAIC Technologies, Altadena) with a 36× Cassegrain objective
(field of view 4 μm × 4 μm). QDI GRAMS was used for
spectral analysis. Transmission was typically measured from 350 to
750 nm. Plane and polarized transmitted light microscopy (PLM) was
carried out on a Leica DMRX microscope with PL Fluotar D 20×/0.48
and 50×/0.85 20× objectives. Leica filter cubes D, I2/3,
and M were employed for fluorescence microscopy. Photomicrographs
were acquired using a Canon EOS D1 camera.

For scanning electron
microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analysis
(SEM/EDX), each sample was placed onto a pressed carbon stub (Ted
Pella Inc.) using a double-sided carbon sticky tab (Ted Pella Inc.).
Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were acquired on a Hitachi S
3400-N variable-pressure scanning electron microscope. An Oxford INCA
X-act detector (80 mm2, resolution 129 eV at 5.9 keV) and
an INCA 300 X-ray spectrometer were used for EDX analysis. The accelerating
voltage was 20 kV, the pressure was 40–60 Pa, and the working
distance was 10 mm. The samples were not coated.

For X-ray powder
diffraction studies, samples containing lead(II)
or zinc(II) acetates in methanol with EL were prepared in air. After
several weeks, the aggregates that had formed were separated as best
as possible but not completely from the EL film and loaded into 1.5
mm diameter Kapton capillary tubes. High-resolution synchrotron powder
X-ray diffraction (HR SP-XRD) data were collected using the mail-in
program on beamline 11-BM at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne
National Laboratory, IL.14 Scans were collected
in transmission mode on spinning Kapton capillaries using a fixed
wavelength of 0.41384 Å. Patterns were collected at 250, 273,
and 285 K.

Results and Discussion
Films prepared from methanol
solutions of EL with and without added
K(CH3COO) behaved similarly, curing to give transparent,
featureless films. In contrast, Pb(CH3COO)2 and
Zn(CH3COO)2 reacted rapidly with EL, evolving
acetic acid as bubbles, and within hours translucent spots that contained
crystalline compounds had formed in the films. We did not observe
any effect on the relative rate of salt formation compared to that
of oxidation on increasing the molar ratio of the metal acetates to
EL over the time frame of our measurements, nor did we observe any
effect on the nature of the products, although the initiation of the
reaction between saturated fatty acids and Pb(II) has been shown to
be related to the chain length of the fatty acid.15 Polarized light micrographs of the Pb(II) product after
ca. 2 h are shown in Figure 1 and of the aggregated Zn(II) product, in Figure 2. Concomitant oxidation of
EL occurred, which was monitored by a decrease in UV absorbance at
280 and 225 nm and the disappearance of a methylene C–H stretch
in the FTIR spectra at 3007 cm–1. In films prepared
from solutions of neat EL and those containing K+, UV–vis
and FTIR measurements showed that oxidation had neared completion
within 4 weeks and in films containing zinc or lead ions it took 9
weeks.

filter cube with bandpass filter of λex 450–490
nm and transmission longpass filter of λex 515 nm).

SEM/EDX results showed that the
metal ions became entirely sequestered
into the compounds formed. The crystallites of Pb–EL, which
self-limit in size at ca. 5 μm diameter (Figure 3), and Zn–EL, which are acicular needles,
did not grow in size over time; rather over a period of 1–3
days, they flocculated into aggregates up to 500 μm in diameter.
Representative images of the aggregates are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Dispersions of colloidal particles, such as the crystallites
formed in the reaction of EL with Pb2+ or Zn2+, are metastable, and the particles tend to move and separate from
a host fluid,16 which is EL in this case,
but for paintings, it would be a plastic oligomeric cured seed or
nut oil.

The formation of metal–carboxylate bonds in the reaction
mixture was determined by measuring the development of strong absorbance
bands in the IR spectrum between 1489 and 1590 cm–1 due to νas COO–.17 Until large aggregates of the metal soaps had formed, the
spectra were dominated by the absorbance of the EL film as the field
of view was large compared to the size of the crystals. The FTIR spectrum
of a Pb–EL aggregate 2 weeks after mixing is shown in Figure 6. Absorbance bands
initially appeared at 1505 and 1547 cm–1 that coalesced
over time to a single broad band centered at ca. 1540 cm–1. For the final lead product, νs COO– is 1390/1370 cm–1.

Figure 6 FTIR spectrum of an aggregate
of the Pb–EL complex aged
2 weeks (black) and the surrounding film, which does contain some
unaggregated crystals (red). The νas COO– has a maximum intensity at 1540 cm–1 and shoulders
at 1610 and 1567 cm–1.

The FTIR spectrum of the mixture of Zn(II) with EL is shown
in Figure 7. The spectrum
obtained
from the area of an aggregate, shown in black, contains peaks due
to absorbances of carboxylate anion groups as well as unreacted ester
carboxylate, which is present in the clear film, whose spectrum is
shown in red. Initially, the spectrum of the aggregate contained a
peak at 1541 cm–1 perhaps due to an intermediate
acetate-containing species; after 1100 h, this stretch had broadened
and moved to ca. 1580 cm–1; it has shoulders at
ca. 1634, 1562, and 1541 cm–1. The νs COO– absorbances occur at 1463 and 1441 cm–1. The values reported for νas COO– of salts of lead(II) and zinc(II) with saturated and
monounsaturated fatty acids, specifically the stearates, palmitates,
and oleates, range between 1542 and 1504 cm–1 for
lead complexes and 1547 and 1538 cm–1 for zinc soaps;18−20 the oleates and zinc linoleate have doublets for this stretch.17 The change we observed in the IR spectra over
time might be an indication of an acetate-containing species, a secondary
reorganization on oxidation to give a more stable product, or changes
as the EL ligand oxidizes. The values of νas COO– cm–1 for Zn–EL are significant
in light of the observations made that zinc soap aggregates in real
paint films and models prepared using linseed oil have a broad peak
at 1570–1590 cm–1, a value much more similar
to that for Zn–EL than that for saturated fatty acid zinc soaps.5,18

Figure 7 FTIR
spectrum of an aggregate of the Zn–EL complex aged
2 weeks (black) and the clear film surrounding it (red). The νas COO– has a maximum intensity at 1581 cm–1 and shoulders at 1634, 1562, and 1541 cm–1.

Hermans et al.18 have discussed the
differences in the IR spectra of simple soap salts, mixed metal salts,
model Zn-paint films, and real paint films and the possible reasons
for them. They dismissed the hypothesis that broadening of the νas COO– stretch in real paint films is owing
to the interaction of fatty acids or triglycerides with ZnO particles.
An interesting suggestion, based on the observation that on melting
a single sharp peak for the asymmetric carboxylate stretch in zinc
palmitate is replaced by three higher-energy peaks, is that broadening
is indicative of distortions in a tetrahedral geometry around Zn(II)
ions. This may also occur in some solid-state carboxylates as it is
known that certain Zn(II) complexes can have polynuclear (e.g., zinc
acetyl acetonate) or polymeric structures. Another possibility raised
by Hermans et al. is that the oxidized linoxyn film that forms the
paint binder may be thought of as an ionomer, which can be neutralized
by free ions, including Zn(II), in the paint matrix. In such a system,
zinc ions could occupy several geometrically distinguishable sites;
therefore, broadening of the absorbances associated with carboxylate
stretches would occur.

The similarity in the νas COO– peaks of the complex models, real paint,
and the simple model, EL,
for drying oil used in this study suggests that the aggregates formed
in the more complex systems may involve unsaturated fatty acids such
as linolenic acid during part of their development and may have comprised
salts of unsaturated fatty acids, which oxidize over time and therefore
would not be identified in historic paints using various analytical
methods. The absence of metal ions in the noncrystalline phase in
the model system and the absence of any carboxylate ion absorbances
in that phase mean that we cannot speculate about the proposed presence
of noncrystalline alkanoates in real paint systems.

HR SP-XRD
measurements were performed on the material recovered
from the films to obtain average information on their structures.
The aggregates of the crystallites were separated manually from the
EL film, but not rinsed, and then loaded into the Kapton capillary.
The SP-XRD patterns (Figure 8) contain broad peak features because of the presence of noncrystalline
material, which most likely is the EL film that could not be entirely
removed, although the presence of noncrystalline soaps ought not be
ruled out. Sharp diffraction peaks at low 2θ indicate that the
systems possess long-range structures, as expected for coordination
polymers. The diffraction patterns did not change significantly between
250 and 285 K, indicating that no phase changes occurred over this
range. It is a narrow and low-temperature range but was chosen to
decrease the movement of the particles within remaining viscous EL.
Corbeil et al. have shown that zinc linoleate has an XRD pattern which
at 2θ = 2–18° is similar to that of soaps formed
between zinc(II) and stearate, palmitate, and oleate.21 The fact that these are all needlelike crystals also supports
the inference that these complexes are structurally similar. However,
the lead complex is different.

Figure 8 HR SP-XRD patterns of the products of
the reaction of Pb(II) and
Zn(II) with EL. The broad features may be due to unreacted EL coating
the crystallites.

For some cases, it has
been proposed that it is possible to determine
the bonding mode of a carboxylate to a metal ion, that is to determine
if it is unidentate, bidentate, bridging, or pseudobridging, by measuring
the energy difference between the symmetric and antisymmetric C=O
stretching modes in the IR spectrum.22,23 However, we
believe that as the exact energy of specific stretches can be dependent
on the surrounding crystallographic symmetry as well as the bonding
mode a comparison between these complexes, that have different symmetries
as well as different metal ions, is not warranted with the information
available in this study. Furthermore, given the complex shape of the
Pb–EL species (seen in Figures 1 and 3), it is likely to have
multiple bonding modes. For comparison, the recorded crystal structures
of neodynium alkanoates show that these complexes have two or more
forms of coordination of the carboxylate group, a fact that was not
evident from their infrared spectra.24

Metal carboxylate coordination polymers have many different structures,25 but even so we are surprised that for these
simple systems the structures of Zn–EL and Pb–EL complexes are very different,
which is clear from PLM and SEM. The Zn–EL crystallites are
needlelike and the crystallographic point group has not been determined,
but the crystal habit is similar to that of the complexes formed with
saturated fatty acids. In contrast, the Pb–EL coordination
polymer appears to have a complex starchlike helical structure. The
BSE image of the Pb–EL complex shows, as does PLM, that the
structure has a void in the center (Figures 1 and 3). This is consistent
with the compound having characteristics similar to some 3D metal-organic
hybrid framework structures that are porous. Lead azelate has a 3D
polymeric network (monoclinc) with 7-fold symmetry around lead(II)
ions that are arranged in stacks bridged by carboxylate groups.26 The ability of lead to support expanded coordination
might be the factor that allows this structure to be formed.27 The FTIR spectra indicate some changes at the
early stage of the reaction, but we have no information from other
techniques such as optical microscopy on the structural changes in
the M–EL systems, and the changes observed may be associated
with curing of EL rather than major crystallographic changes or formation
of ionomers, which Hermans et al. have observed in model systems of
metal soaps in linseed oil.28 Short-chain
lead(II) carboxylates have been reported to convert from a crystalline
to a smectic phase over the temperature range of 343–379 K.29 Changes in the structure over time have been
reported for short-chain lead(II) alkanonates.30 In these systems, conformational changes occur between
solid and condis phases with concomitant changes in X-ray diffraction
patterns and infrared spectra, but, as noted, we do not have evidence
for this kind of change in the M–EL systems over the time frame
and temperature range employed here.

The Pb–EL and Zn–EL
species luminesce. We measured
the emission of the lead–EL complex to see if the species formed
might be related to those responsible for the atypical luminescence
that has been described for lead white paint films. Whereas cured
linseed oil itself has a weak emission at ca. 510 nm,31 lead white paint films have an atypical strong, broad emission
at ca. 500–550 nm.32 An excitation–emission
spectrum obtained from the entire plate of Pb–EL (crystals
and curing EL) has three bands: λex/em = 296/462,
366/442, and 483/572 nm. The emission spectrum of Pb(II)-EL upon irradiation
at 360 nm has broad maxima at ca. 485 and 555 nm (black trace in Figure 9). The emission spectrum
is broader and has a longer wavelength than that of oxidized EL, which
develops an emission maximum at ca. 450 nm. A photomicrograph of the
emission from an aggregate of the Zn–EL complex upon near-UV/visible
excitation is shown in Figure 2b. The strong emission from zinc oxide itself has precluded
noticing a soap-related emission in paint films, and this remains
to be studied.

Figure 9 Macroscopic emission spectra, λex = 360
nm, of
EL (red) and EL mixed with Pb(CH3COO)2 (black)
after 18 h (dotted) and 1 month (solid). (Collected using a fiber
optic attachment on a Fluorolog spectrophotometer.)

Coordination polymers and metal-organic hybrid
complexes are often
luminescent,33 including some that contain
lead. Lead soaps exhibit weak fluorescence at low temperature34 and Martínez Casado et al. have shown
that the glass states of lead alkanoates phosphoresce.35 Compounds prepared from lead(II) with a variety
of aromatic carboxylic acids emit in the blue to green (420–520
nm) region, depending on the structure and nature of bonding of the
carboxylate group.36 Pb(II) complexes of
butyric acid and N-donor ligands have several emission bands deep
into the visible region.37 These observations
suggest that the presence of carboxylate complexes of lead may account
at least in part for the observed luminescence of lead white paint
films.

We propose that two apparently unrelated observations
regarding
lead white paints, “soap” formation and atypical luminescence,
are connected. Traditionally, the pigment lead white was prepared
from metal coils or buckles using the so-called stack process through
the reaction in air with acetic acid vapors, which ultimately gives
the white basic carbonate. To obtain a pure product, the scrapings
were washed to remove metal and lead acetates.38,39 Insufficient washing would leave soluble salts and metal particles
in the pigment. Although it has not been specifically noted that soluble
lead salts remaining in lead white contribute to soap formation in
paints, Pb(CH3COO)2 added to cobalt stannate
and vine black paints as a drier did appear to be correlated with
the development of defects in the paint films.4,40 Keune
and Boon41 reported that paintings by the
Hudson River School painter Frederic Edwin Church quickly developed
issues because of lead soaps, the formation of which was related to
the presence of lead acetate as a drier in the paint. Using EL as
the model for a drying oil, we have shown that Zn(II) and Pb(II) form
complex coordination compounds with unsaturated fatty acids. These
products, unlike soaps formed with saturated fatty acids, luminesce
at room temperature.

Reactions between metal ions and drying
oils to form the so-called
soaps occur across a broad range of paintings and are sometimes more
and sometimes less obvious in paint films containing lead white, lead
tin yellow, red lead, and zinc white. A large study of 108 17th and
18th century English paintings showed that the phenomenon of lead
soap formation cannot yet be related to the factors such as treatment
or environment, although it appears that leaner paint films have less
soap formation.42 The results from the
simple system used in this study clearly demonstrate that the reaction
between an unsaturated fatty acid ester, a model for oil, and soluble
metal ions is rapid and in the case of Zn(II) and Pb(II) leads to
the precipitation of crystals that aggregate. The fact that not all
paintings equally present the evidence for lead soap formation might
be related to the comparative purity of the lead white available in
specific places at particular times and the presence of mobile ions.
Lead white that has been washed well, thereby removing Pb(CH3COO)2, which is easily solubilized, along with the unreacted
metal, might provide a paint film that is less prone to rapid formation
of particles of insoluble lead carboxylates and their subsequent aggregation.

Conclusions
On mixing EL, used as a simple model for linseed oil paint, with
lead(II) or zinc(II) acetates, crystallites of luminescent complexes
rapidly formed and aggregated into flocs within 48 h. These consist
of metal carboxylates, but they are not simple salts. The luminescence
and structural properties indicate that the Pb(II)–EL and Zn(II)–EL
complexes are coordination polymers that have long-range structures.
There are significant differences in the physical behavior of the
EL complexes compared to that of the soaps formed with saturated or
monounsaturated fatty acids, evident from their FTIR spectra as well
as luminescence behavior and structural information. The EL complexes
have properties, such as luminescence behavior, that are between those
of the simple soaps and the “soaps” found in paints.
We believe that this work may be a valuable model for future studies
of the problem of paint reactivity. The lead complex formed on reaction
with the unsaturated fatty acid has an interesting complex structure
that is different from the structures formed on reaction with straight-chain
unsaturated carboxylic acids and adds information regarding the possibility
of reaction with unoxidized fatty acids. The observation that simple
systems of a divalent metal ion with an unsaturated fatty acid ester
give rise to stable, highly structured products provides insight into
the studies of metal ion sequestration, stabilization, and toxicity
in biological and ecological research.15
