Poly(silylether)s
are interesting materials because of their degradation
property under hydrolytic conditions and have been prepared via hydrosilylation
polymerization from dicarbonyl and hydrosilanes, and via dehydrogenative
cross-coupling of diols and hydrosilanes under catalytic conditions.
Here, we present a manganese–salen compound based on an inexpensive
and nontoxic metal that could effectively catalyze both polymerization
reactions with hydrosilane. A series of poly(silylether)s containing
various aliphatic and aromatic backbones have been synthesized from
diol and dicarbonyl substrates. Moderate to high yields of polymers
with number-average molecular weights up to 15 kg/mol are obtained.
Because of the dual activity of the manganese catalyst, unsymmetrical
substrates with mixed functional groups, such as p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, p-hydroxy benzylalcohol, and
3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, have been employed to afford poly(silylether)s
with multiple silicon connectivity in the main chain.

Introduction
Polymers with silicon
in the main chain have received much attention
in organic and material chemistry because of their various industrial
and academic applications.1−6 Polysilanes with the Si–Si repeating units are promising
for use in electronic devices because of their conductivity.7 Poly(siloxane)s with Si–O–Si linkages
and their copolymers are extensively used as elastomers and plastics,
and in other industrial applications because of their low-temperature
flexibility and high-temperature stability.8−15 Hydro-sensitive silicon polymers can be employed in medical applications
such as controlled release of drugs.16 Poly(siloxane)s
are precursors for the synthesis of silicon oxycarbides (SiOC) via
pyrolysis and direct photo-cross-linking methods.17,18 The SiOC ceramic has been applied in coatings and as electrode materials
in lithium batteries.19−24 Recently, there have been renewed interests in silicon-containing
polymers, particularly poly(silylether)s with Si–O–C
linkages, on account of their potential sustainability.25,26 Silicon and oxygen are practically inexhaustible because of their
abundance, and carbon can be more readily sourced from biomass. The
Si–O–C linkages are hydrolytically degradable, different
from the typical biodegradable ester linkages that require enzymes
for degradation. This makes the poly(silylether)-based materials particularly
attractive in short-term and/or single-use applications.27 Importantly, the degradation behavior, along
with the thermomechanical properties, can be adjusted by changing
the substituent groups on silicon and/or carbon backbones of poly(silylether)s28−30 and by copolymerization with other segments.31

Poly(silylether)s have been prepared by various methods
depending
on the nature of the actual linkages. Similar to the synthesis of
silylethers, the reaction of dichlorosilanes with diols through polycondensation
leads to the formation of poly(silylether)s.32−38 Chlorosilanes can also react with bis(epoxide)s and bis(oxetane)s
through additions catalyzed by quaternary onium salts to afford poly(silylether)s.39−42 However, use of chlorosilanes has limitations.43 Chlorosilanes are moisture-sensitive and usually produce
hydrogen chloride and other unwanted byproducts in polymerization
reactions, which requires additional methods for separation.44 To overcome these problems, chlorosilanes have
been replaced with diamino- and dialkoxysilanes as the coupling partners;
in particular, diphenoxy- and dianilinosilanes have shown good activity
toward the synthesis of high-molecular-weight polymers.14,45 Still these methods may have limited substrate scope or require
maintaining the high-temperature conditions (200–300 °C)
throughout the reaction.14,45−48

Alternatively, hydrosilanes have been deemed as optimal replacements
for chlorosilanes because of their stability to air and ease of handling.
Reactions with diols through dehydrogenative coupling28,49−51 and with dicarbonyls through hydrosilylation polymerization29,52−54 afford a variety of poly(silylether)s (Scheme 1). Notably, these methods are
highly atom-economical, producing H2 as the sole byproduct
or no byproduct. In general, these reactions are effected by catalysts
derived from precious transition metals, usually ruthenium, palladium,
and rhodium.49,52,55−57 However, the high cost, low abundance, and high catalyst
loading (up to 10 mol %) of such metals
are the main drawbacks of these methods.58 Other catalysts based on boranes59 and
alkali metals25,60 are also known. Recently, the
catalytic systems derived from inexpensive, earth-abundant metals
such as iron have been reported.61,62

Scheme 1 Poly(silylether)s
from Hydrosilanes
We have investigated the high-valent transition-metal
complexes
for their roles in catalytic reduction and silane activation.63−66 It is observed that an air-stable and easily prepared salen–manganese
complex, [MnN(salen-3,5-tBu2)]67 (1), is an effective
catalyst for hydrosilylation of carbonyl compounds and dehydrogenative
coupling of hydroxyl compounds with hydrosilanes.68,69 Encouraged by these results and in connection with our interests
in biodegradable materials,70−72 we sought to synthesize poly(silylether)s
from a variety of diols and dicarbonyls under manganese catalysis.
Furthermore, taking advantage of the dual activity of 1, we have employed substrates with mixed functional groups in the
reaction with hydrosilanes to generate poly(silylether)s. As far as
we are aware, no metal catalyst has been reported that could catalyze
the synthesis of poly(silylether)s from three types of substrates
(diols, dicarbonyls, and hydroxyl carbonyls) with hydrosilanes.

Results
and Discussion
Optimization Reactions
Our initial
experiments started
with optimizing suitable reaction conditions for polycondensation
of diols and hydrosilanes. 1,4-Benzenedimethanol and diphenylsilane
were chosen as the representative coupling partners in the presence
of catalytic amount of manganese complex 1 (1 mol %),
and selected results are presented in Table 1. According to the conditions in our previous
work,68 the reaction was performed using
acetonitrile as the solvent at reflux temperature (entry 1). As expected,
the initial green color of the reaction mixture arising from 1 turned brown and then yellow, indicating onset of the reaction.
After 12 h, 1H NMR spectroscopy showed greater than 95%
conversion of diphenylsilane. However, despite the high conversion,
the number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymer was determined by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) to be 4000 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.28). To improve Mn,
several solvents were screened next. When acetonitrile was replaced
by tetrahydrofuran (THF) (entry 2), low-Mn (1900 g/mol) polymers were obtained with only 50% conversion of
diphenylsilane in 12 h. Use of 1,4-dioxane as a solvent resulted in
95% conversion and high molecular weight (Mn = 7900 g/mol) (entry 3), suggesting that the coordination ability
of cyclic ethers might not be the main reason for the low conversion
observed with THF. Reactions carried out in refluxing toluene led
to even higher Mn (9200 g/mol) within
12 h (entry 4). Given the above observations, it seemed that the reaction
temperature played a key role in the polymerization reaction. In agreement
with this, the reaction performed at ambient temperature in toluene
showed no reaction even after 48 h and the green color remained the
same during that period (entry 5). However, attempts at achieving
high molecular weights using high-boiling aromatic solvents such as
xylenes and mesitylene met with limited success (entries 6 and 7).
Although the molecular weights obtained under refluxing conditions
were decent,
they were lower than those obtained with toluene. Finally, as air
extrusion seemed to have little effect in our previous dehydrogenative
coupling,69 a reaction was performed under
air in refluxing toluene for convenience (entry 8). However, conversion
of monomers remained low (58%) even after extending the reaction time
to 48 h and Mn also dropped approximately
by half (4500 g/mol). These results suggested the importance of inert
conditions for the generation of high-molecular-weight polymers.

The brown-colored reaction
mixtures from entries 3 and 4 were purified
by precipitation. The resulting whitish-gray poly(silylether)s were
obtained in 75.9 and 75.6% yields, respectively. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the disappearances of hydroxyl groups at 2.0 ppm
and silane hydrogens at 4.84 ppm and the shift of benzylic protons
from 4.65 to 4.81 ppm suggested the formation of poly(silylether)
of 1,4-benzenedimethanol and diphenylsilane (Figure 1). The 13C NMR spectrum also supported
the formation of poly(silylether), as only six peaks in the aromatic
region (129.71–139.47 ppm, four from silane and two from diol)
and one peak at 64.98 ppm (benzylic carbon) were observed. In addition,
the absence of both hydroxyl (3500 cm–1) and SiH
groups (2133 cm–1) in the attenuated total reflection
Fourier transform infrared (ATR FT-IR) spectrum further supported
the NMR assignments (Figure 2). The characteristic stretching frequencies at ∼1040
cm–1 indicated the formation of Si–O–C
connections.50

Step-Growth Polymerization
To learn more about the
polymerization, we performed a set of reactions between 1,4-benzenedimethanol
and diphenylsilane to explore the correlation among the conversion,
time, and molecular weight of the polymer. During the reaction, samples
were taken at each time interval and then were subjected to analysis
by NMR and GPC. Conversion of diol was 19% in 1 h and reached around
50% in 4 h. However, at this point, the molecular weight of the polymer
was only 1600 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.33), indicating that mostly oligomers were formed
in the starting hours. At 8 h, the conversion increased to 91% with Mn of 4600 g/mol, and at 22 h, the conversion
was 96% with Mn of 13000 g/mol. The sharp
increase in the molecular weight in the later stage of the reaction
suggested that the oligomers formed in the initial reaction stage
were still active and were later incorporated to form long-chain polymers.
The growth behavior of molecular weight (Figure 3) is typical of step-growth polymerization
reactions.73 The similar nonlinear growth
of the dispersities (Mw/Mn) also supported the fact that these are step-growth-type
polymerization reactions.

square) vs conversion.

Diols Scope
To extend the substrate scope, we first
chose a simple aryldiol, 1,4-benzenediol (1,4-hydroquinone), because
polymers with π-conjugated groups in the main or side chains
are of interest for their prospective applications as electronic,
photonic, and ceramic materials (Table 2, entry 2).74−76 The copolymerization reaction
between 1,4-benzenediol and a disiloxane (1,3-bis(diethylamino)tetramethyldisiloxane)
under melt conditions was reported in the literature; however, the
reported molecular weight of the polymer was low (Mn = 3600 g/mol).33 In our current
dehydrogenative coupling process between 1,4-benzenediol and diphenylsilane,
>95% conversion of silane was observed in 12 h and a white solid
was
obtained in 70% yield after purification. The disappearance of hydroxyl
and silicon hydrogen peaks in both 1H NMR and FT-IR spectra
confirmed the formation of the desired poly(silylether). In the 29Si NMR spectrum, a single peak at −35.2 ppm was observed.
GPC analysis showed a high-molecular-weight polymer with Mn of 15 000 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 2.38). To expand on aryl diols,
a dehydrogenative coupling reaction between a highly π-conjugated
4,4′-biphenol and diphenylsilane was performed (entry 3) under
the same conditions. The conversion reached 95% in 15 h, and a whitish-gray
polymer was obtained in 88% yield after purification. However, the
molecular weight obtained was somewhat lower, Mn = 7200 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.87).

Next, we carried out polycondensation
reactions with aliphatic
diols, namely, 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and 1,4-cyclohexanediol (Table 2, entries 4 and 5).
These two substrates can be viewed as the aliphatic analogues of 1,4-benzenedimethanol
and 1,4-benzenediol, respectively. The reaction between primary diol
1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol and diphenylsilane was monitored up to 24
h, by which time silane conversion of 95% was achieved. Purification
afforded the corresponding poly(silylether) with 62% isolated yield,
and the observed Mn was 5100 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.4). The
reaction with a bulkier secondary diol, 1,4-cyclohexanediol, required
a longer reaction time, as only 80% conversion was achieved after
20 h, although the isolated yield was good (70%). Given the slow conversion,
it was not surprising that the molecular weight of the resulting polymer
was rather low, Mn = 3100 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.73). In
agreement with the low molecular weight, small peaks at around 5.3–5.4
ppm were observed in the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure S9), which could be attributed to the tertiary Si–H
end group in the polymer. Our previous results showed that diphenylsilane
reacted with secondary alcohols in a two-step process, but the second
step was considerably slower than the first step.68 Similarly here, the steric hindrance plays a vital role
in these two polycondensation reactions, as reflected in the extended
reaction times and low molecular weights of the polymers.

Conversely,
when a sterically less hindered linear monomer, 1,6-hexanediol,
was used as the substrate, a high-molecular-weight polymer, Mn = 11400 g/mol, was produced in high yields
(84%) (Table 2, entry
6). These results suggest that sterically less hindered monomers react
readily to give the high-molecular-weight polymers. On the other hand,
when another diol, 1,4-butanediol, was used, cyclic silylether was
obtained as the main product instead of poly(silylether)s.68,77 Obviously a rigid and/or long linker between the two hydroxyl groups
of diols is desirable for the formation of poly(silylether)s.

Dicarbonyls
Considering our previous results that manganese
complex 1 is also an efficient catalyst for the hydrosilylation
of aldehydes and ketones,69 we decided
to apply the current system to dicarbonyl compounds for the synthesis
of poly(silylether)s. In this study, benzene-1,4-dicarboxaldehyde
(terephthalaldehyde) was chosen as the reaction partner with diphenylsilane,
in part, because the resulting polymer should be the same as the polymer
obtained from 1,4-benzenedimethanol (Table 2, entry 1 vs Table 3, entry 1). Under the optimized conditions,
the consumption of terephthalaldehyde and the hydrosilylation of the
carbonyl group were confirmed by the appearance of benzylic signals
at 4.81 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum and at 65.0 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum. The conversion of terephthalaldehyde reached
90% in 24 h, and workup by precipitation gave 58% isolated yield of
a polymer. The FT-IR spectrum of the polymer showed the disappearance
of the C=O stretching frequency at 1663 cm–1 and of silane hydrogens at 2134 cm–1, and a single
peak at −30.3 was observed in the 29Si NMR spectrum.
These spectroscopic data are essentially the same as those resulting
from 1,4-benzenedimethanol. The main difference is that the molecular
weight is low, Mn = 2400 g/mol (Mw/Mn = 1.86). The
low molecular weight is supposed to come from the less active nature
of carbonyls in comparison with that of the hydroxyl groups in the
reaction. The monitoring of the reaction profile of terephthalaldehyde
and 1,4-benzenedimethanol under the same conditions confirms the faster
reaction of diol (Figure S36). This difference
in reactivity with hydrosilanes has been observed in other systems
and is attributed to the stronger nucleophilicity of hydroxyls over
that of carbonyls (see below).78 To further
compare the activity of dicarbonyl monomers with that of diols, reactions
were performed with 1,6-hexanedial79 and
1,4-cyclohexanedione, the analogous structures of 1,6-hexanediol and
1,4-cyclohexanediol, respectively (Table 3, entries 2 and 3). As expected, the reaction
with 1,6-hexanedial took 24 h to reach 90% conversion and the isolated
yield was only 40%; it took even longer (48 h) for 1,4-cyclohexanedione
to reach 90% conversion with a slightly higher isolated yield (49%).
Both reactions resulted in low-molecular-weight polymers, Mn = 1800 and 2100 g/mol, respectively, consistent
with the slow rate of reaction. The low yields in these reactions,
despite the >90% conversion, might be a result of the increased
presence
of short-chain oligomers in these reactions that were lost during
the precipitation process.

Substrates
with Mixed Functional Groups
So far all
of the substrates used are structurally symmetrical with two identical
functional groups. Encouraged by the results that poly(silylether)s
can be prepared from both diols and dicarbonyls using the same manganese
catalyst, we sought to employ substrates with unsymmetrical, mixed
functional groups to further extend the substrate scope. Thus, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was selected as a monomer to react
with diphenylsilane (Table 3, entry 4). Although the reaction time (18 h) required to
reach 90% conversion of silane was less than that of the three reactions
in entries 1–3, the isolated yield and the molecular weight
(Mn = 3800 g/mol, Mw/Mn = 1.73) were greater than
those of the three reactions. Relatively speaking, these values fall
right in between those obtained from 1,4-benzenediol and terephthalaldehyde,
in line with the difference in their respective reactivities toward
polymerization reactions under manganese catalysis. As substrate p-hydroxybenzaldehyde has two different termini,
it can form polymers with different connectivities, which was evidenced
by the presence of multiple peaks for the benzylic signals in both
the 1H and 13C NMR spectra (Figures S17 and S18). These observations were consistent with
the 29Si NMR spectrum, in which three peaks at −37.1,
−33.5, and −30.1 ppm were observed (Figure S30), as predicted from the three different silicon
environments resulting from the head-to-head, head-to-tail, and tail-to-tail
connections (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Three silicon centers in the poly(silyl ether) backbone.

Similarly, the reaction of p-hydroxybenzyl
alcohol
with diphenylsilane (entry 5) yielded a polymer with a slightly higher
molecular weight (Mn = 4500 g/mol) that
features three 29Si NMR signals (Figure S31), as expected. It should be noted that the relative intensities
of the three peaks are somewhat different from the results obtained
with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The reaction with another
unsymmetrical monomer, 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, gave comparable
results (entry 6): more than 95% conversion and 80% isolated yield
were achieved in 19 h. The molecular weight (Mn = 9000 g/mol) was high when compared with that of polymers
from dicarbonyls and hydroxyl carbonyl. Again three distinct peaks
appeared in the 29Si NMR (Figure S32) spectrum, in agreement with the formation of three different types
of connectivities. The high yield and Mn constitute additional evidence that hydroxyl compounds are faster
than carbonyls in the polymerization reactions.

From these results
and early studies, a plausible mechanism can
be proposed for the manganese-catalyzed polymerization of diols and
dicarbonyls (Scheme 2). The high-valent Mn(V) species is first reduced by diphenylsilane
to a low-valent Mn(II) or Mn(III) species,68 which correlates with the color changes during the early stage of
the reaction. The reduction of Mn(V) is not unexpected given the oxidizing
power of high-valent first-row transition metals. Hydrosilane is then
activated by coordination with the metal center via either an η1- or an η2-SiH adduct,80 which may serve as a common intermediate for hydrosilylation
and dehydrogenative cross-coupling. Although not directly observed
in the present system, such adducts with low-valent manganese are
well-documented in the literature.81−83 Nucleophilic attack
of the hydroxyl or carbonyl groups on the silicon furnishes the Si–O
bonds, which is accompanied by the hetereolytic cleavage of the Si–H
bonds. The observation that diols are more active with hydrosilanes
than with dicarbonyls is in agreement with the stronger nucleophilicity
of hydroxyls over that of carbonyls.78 It
should be mentioned that the oxidative addition of hydrosilane leading
to a classical silyl hydride species cannot be ruled out at this stage;84−86 however, our experimental observation that the present manganese
catalyst is ineffective in catalyzing the hydrosilylation of allylcyclohexane
is more consistent with a Mn–SiH adduct intermediate.78 The exact process following the nucleophilic
attack may vary, and a comprehensive investigation is needed to reveal
these mechanistic details.

Scheme 2 Plausible Mechanism for Polymerization
Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have demonstrated that a salen–manganese
complex can effectively catalyze the synthesis of various poly(silylether)s
from hydrosilanes and diols via dehydrogenative cross-coupling and from
dialdehyde/diketone via hydrosilylation polymerization. Diol monomers
show a higher activity than that of dicarbonyls in these reactions,
as reflected in the higher yields and molecular weights obtained under
comparable conditions. Furthermore, because of the dual activity of
the manganese catalyst, unsymmetrical monomers with mixed functional
groups have been successfully incorporated into poly(silylether)s
that contain different connectivities around the silicon center. The
use of a catalyst derived from an earth-abundant, biocompatible metal
via highly atom-economical processes represents a sustainable strategy
for the production of hydrolytically degradable materials. Further
work on improving the catalytic efficiency and integrating bio-based
building blocks is underway in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Instrument
All of the solvents and liquid
substrates were degasified and dried over activated molecular sieves
(4 Å) prior to use. Deuterated solvents were purchased from Cambridge
Isotope Laboratory. All 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE-500 NMR spectrometer and referenced
to the residue solvents in CDCl3 or CD3CN. GPC
analysis was performed on a Varian Prostar system, using the PLgel
5 μm Mixed-D column, a Prostar 355 RI detector, and THF as the
eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (20 °C). Polystyrene standards
were used for calibration. Infrared spectroscopy results were obtained
on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5 FT-IR instrument and analyzed with
OMNIC 8.2 software. The samples for IR analysis were directly loaded
using an iD5 ATR accessory as a thin film without any support. DSC
measurements were performed on a Perkin Elmer Jade differential scanning
calorimeter, and the instrument was calibrated using zinc and indium
standards. Glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of polymer samples were determined from the second heating cycles
with a heating/cooling rate of 20 °C/min under nitrogen atmosphere
(20 mL/min). DSC data were analyzed using Pyris V9.0.2 software.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Poly(silylether)s
All of the reactions were performed under inert conditions unless
otherwise mentioned. A Schlenk flask (50–100 mL) was used as
the reaction flask and oil baths equipped with digital thermometers
and controllers were used to set and read the temperature. The general
procedure includes loading the Schlenk flask with 1 mol % catalyst
[MnN(salen-3,5-tBu2)] (1), stoichiometric equivalents of substrate and diphenylsilane
(1:1 molar ratio), followed by the addition of 2.5–3.0 mL of
solvent in the glove box. The resulting reaction mixture was taken
out of the glove box and connected to a Schlenk line under inert conditions.
Then, the reaction mixture was heated at reflux temperature for a
specific time (mentioned in the article). The reaction was monitored
by periodically taking out small amount of samples for NMR and GPC
analyses.

The polymers were purified by the precipitation method.
As all of the polymers were soluble in dichloromethane (DCM) and insoluble
in methanol (MeOH), these two solvents were used in the precipitation
process. At the end of the reaction (>90% conversion), the brown
color
viscous reaction mixture was first homogenized by the addition of
as low as possible amount of DCM (1–2 mL), then MeOH was added
portionwise (8–10 mL) until it turned to a biphasic mixture.
The top layer, which has the unreacted materials, was taken out by
a pipette, and the bottom viscous/solid layer was washed with MeOH
a few times (typically two to three times with 6–8 mL of MeOH
each time) until it gave a white/light yellow color viscous/solid
polymer. The resulting polymer was dried to a constant weight and
characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and FT-IR
spectroscopies and GPC and DSC.
