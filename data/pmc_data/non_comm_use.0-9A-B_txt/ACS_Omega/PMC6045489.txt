The total synthesis
of highly potent and scarcely available marine
natural product (−)-jahanyne was attempted resulting in a solution-phase
synthesis of pruned versions with comparable activity. A simple and
facile synthetic route was employed for the preparation of pruned
congeners and would be scalable. The lipophilic tail of the natural
product was synthesized from R-(+)-citronellol, utilizing
easily available chemicals. All the synthesized compounds were screened
for apoptotic activity against a panel of cell lines. These compounds
depicted marked binding to B cell lymphoma 2 till 50 °C in cellular
thermal shift analysis.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Marine
cyanobacteria have been an excellent source of new natural
products with unique biological profiles.1,2 Suenaga
et al.3−6 have investigated the constituents of marine cyanobacterium, Lyngbya sp., and isolated an acetylene-containing
lipopeptide, jahanyne (1). This marine natural product
has a rare lipophilic tail (chiral 2,4-dimethyl decynoic acid 2) and an uncommon hydrophilic head engaging per N-methylated
octamer [including Oep (2-(1-oxo-ethyl)-pyrrolidine moiety)]. The
N-terminal decynoic acid moiety 2 is reported to be a
part structure only once before in carmabin A,7,8 whose
absolute stereochemistry is not reported yet. Jahanyne (1) has shown promising growth inhibition of human cancer cells and
induced apoptosis in HeLa cells (1.8 μM). Cell suicide is an
important process of all living organisms where unwanted cells are
removed from the body. For a healthy being, a balance between cell
death and proliferation has to be maintained. The genetic studies
on Caenorhabditis elegans and its correlation
to human genes have helped to identify a previously unknown gene BCL-2
(B cell lymphoma 2) from the breakpoint region of a recurrent chromosomal
translocation in human follicular lymphoma. Enforced overexpression
of BCL-2 promoted lymphocyte accumulation in mice studies which resulted
either in autoimmune diseases or in cancer.9,10

The fascinating biological activity and bolaamphiphile mimicking
skeleton feature of jahanyne attracted our attention to take up the
total synthesis. Incidentally no total synthesis is reported yet.
Herein, we report our attempts toward the total synthesis of jahanyne,
where the efforts culminated in the synthesis of desmethyl jahanyne 1a and few pruned analogues 28 and 29. Interestingly, one of these pruned versions had comparable activity
with respect to natural product. Disappointingly, the permethylation
efforts of converting 1a to 1 were futile.
Our efforts also provided lead toward pruning large molecular weight
natural products to low-molecular-weight analogues with comparable
biological profile.

Retrosynthetically, 1a could
be envisioned to be synthesized
by coupling of lipophilic acid 2 with the desmethyl octapeptide 3a. This would be a prerequisite advanced scaffold for permethylation.
Alternatively, permethylated octapeptide 3 could be directly
coupled to 2 to achieve total synthesis of 1. The decynoic acid 2 was envisioned to synthesize from R-(+)-citronellol (which embodies one of the two chiral
centers) via Evans’ chemistry to install the second chiral
center. Similarly, the desmethyl octapeptide 3a was planned
through 5-mer + 3-mer approach by stitching desmethyl pentamer 5 and desmethyl trimer 6. Alternatively, the
permethylated octapeptide 3 was planned to be synthesized
by coupling permethylated tetramers 7 and 8 (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Retrosynthetic analysis.

2 Results and Discussion
R-(+)-Citronellol (4) was converted
to diene 9 following the literature procedure.11 Hydroboration–oxidation sequence of 9 with 9-BBN and H2O2/NaOH gave alcohol 10 in 85% yield,12 which on oxidation
with Dess–Martin periodinane (DMP) afforded aldehyde 11 in 89% yield.13 The Corey–Fuchs
reaction with CBr4 and n-BuLi followed
by the addition of trimethylsilyl chloride yielded the homologated
tetramethylsilane (TMS)-alkyne 12 in 72% yield.14 The isopropylene group in 12 was
cleaved using a two-step process,15,16 epoxidation
with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (m-CPBA) followed by the addition of H5IO6 to
furnish aldehyde 13, which on oxidation with NaClO2 yielded the acid 14.

The Evans’
auxiliary (XA) was conjugated to acid 14 to
furnish imide 15 in 78% yield. Methylation
was accomplished using NaHMDS/MeI to provide 16 in 76%
yield with 86% de. A column chromatographic separation allowed isolation
of pure 16.17 Exposure of 16 to tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF)
allowed the cleavage of TMS in acetylenic functionality to generate
free alkyne 17 in 93% yield, which upon hydrolysis with
LiOH/H2O2 provided the acid unit 2 of jahanyne in 90% yield.18 The executed
route (Scheme 1) allowed
us to synthesize gram quantities of lipophilic end of jahanyne toward
total synthesis.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Acid Fragment 2
The octapeptide unit, for operational
simplicity, was divided into
two tetramers 7 and 8. The N-terminal unit 7 was synthesized in a stepwise manner by the addition of
desired amino acids in protected form. Thus, the known dimer 18(19) on hydrolysis of ester with
lithium hydroxide and coupling with N-Me-l-Val-OMe by following HATU and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) conditions yielded the trimer 19 in 80% over two steps. The hydrolysis of ester 19 with LiOH followed by coupling with N-Me-l-Val-OMe following the same conditions furnished permethyl tetramer 7.

The other permethyl tetramer 8 was synthesized
by
coupling the known Boc Oep 20(20) with N-Boc-l-Pro following HATU-assisted
amidation. The Boc group in 21 was removed with trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA); however, the free NH group of proline ring participated
in an intramolecular cyclization with keto group of Oep.4 To circumvent, compound 21 was reduced
with NaBH4 to generate diastereomeric alcohol 22. Compound 22 was coupled with N-Boc-N-Me-l-Phe-OH after removing the Boc group in 22 with TFA, oxidation with DMP provided 23 in
61% yield. The resultant 23 on Boc-deprotection followed
by coupling with N-Boc-N-Me-l-Val-OH yielded permethyl tetramer 8 in 56% yield
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Permethyl Tetramers 7 and 8
Reagents and conditions: (a)
LiOH, MeOH/H2O; (b) HATU, DIPEA, DMF, 12 h; and (c) TFA,
CH2Cl2, 2 h.

With both
permethylated tetramers in hand, we tried coupling of
them to get the octapeptide 3. N-Boc
deprotection of 8 and ester hydrolysis of 7 gave the corresponding amine and acid. However, coupling reagents
such as HATU, COMU, PyBrop, and so forth did not yield the required
octapeptide 3. In addition, coupling between acid chloride
of 7 and free amine of 8 was also unsuccessful.
At this point, we revisited our strategy and planned synthesis of
desmethyl octapeptide 3a, which on coupling with 2 followed by permethylation would result in 1.

The synthesis of octapeptide 3a was planned
from the
coupling of pentamer 5 and trimer 3. The
dimer 24(21) was subjected to
saponification to get free acid, which was coupled with Oep to get
trimer 6 in 72% yield (Scheme 3). The dimer 25(22) on ester hydrolysis with LiOH followed by coupling with
valine methyl ester under EDC, hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) conditions
gave the trimer 26 in 75% yield. TFA-catalyzed N-Boc hydrolysis of 26 followed by HATU-mediated
peptide coupling with dimer 27 resulted in pentamer 5 in 64% yield over two steps. Ester hydrolysis of pentamer 5 with LiOH and coupling with N-Boc deprotected
tripeptide 6 resulted in desmethyl octapeptide 3a. Exhaustive permethylation of 3a to 3 was futile under NaH/MeI, Ag2O/MeI,23 (CH3)2SO4/NaH,24 dimethyl carbonate/cetrimonium bromide (CTAB),25 and HCOOMe/CTAB conditions.26 Condensation of deprotected amine group of 3a with lipophilic acid 2 gave desmethyl jahanyne 1a in 44% yield over two steps.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Desmethyl
Jahanyne
Reagents and conditions: (a)
LiOH, MeOH/H2O, 4 h; (b) TFA, CH2Cl2, 2 h; and (c) HATU, DIPEA, DMF, rt, 12 h.

Similarly, our efforts toward the synthesis of 1 from 1a through permethylation were also unsuccessful after several
attempts. To explore any of the synthesized intermediates exhibit
desired properties, we coupled the peptide units with the acid 2. Thus, we coupled the permethylated tetramer 7 and 8 with 2 individually and isolated
the conjugates 28(27) and 29 in 42 and 65% yield, respectively, as pruned versions of
the natural product (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Fatty
Acid Conjugates 28 and 29
Reagents and conditions: (a)
TFA, CH2Cl2, 2 h and (b) HATU, DMF, DIPEA, rt,
12 h.

At this point, we evaluated all the
synthesized compounds against
a panel of cell lines to identify compounds with activity in tandem
with the reported value of the natural product. The results threw
up some interesting observations (Table 1). It was observed that tetramer 8 had activity (IC50 1.5 μM) comparable to the value
reported in the literature for jahanyne 1 (IC50 1.8 μM) against HeLa cells. Both the conjugates 28 and 29 also exhibited the activity in the range of
3.0 μM on HeLa cells.3 However, 1a was not effective on the same cell lines.

The most active cytotoxic
compounds (compounds 8, 28, and 29) were taken toward identifying their
mechanistic roles in cell cycle employing DU-145 cancer
cell line.28 The cell cycle profile depicted
compounds (8, 28, and 29) with
significant G0/G1 arrest at 1 μM concentration when compared to vehicle
control (Figure 2).
An increased percent of late apoptotic cells was observed when treated
with these compounds, similar to positive control, doxorubicin (Figure 3A). Elevated expression
levels of proapoptotic genes including Bax, Bid, and Caspase-3 were
found when treated with cytotoxic compounds (8, 28, and 29) for about 24 h at 1 μM concentration
as confirmed by the semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) techniques (Figure 3B).29 The immunoblot assay authenticated
that BCL-2 antiapoptotic protein was found at lower levels or absent
when treated with compounds 8, 28, and 29 with concomitant increase in the levels of proapoptotic
proteins, BAX and Annexin V (Figure 3C). Thus, the data suggest apoptosis-inducing pathway
progresses in these cells by inhibition of BCL-2.

Figure 2 Cell cycle analysis in DU-145 cells treated with
compounds 8, 28, and 29 depicted
a G0/G1 cell
cycle arrest. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control and depicted
comparable effect.

compounds 8, 28, and 29. (A)
Increased percent of cells observed in the late apoptotic phase in
the compound-treated group as compared to control. (B) RT-PCR analysis
depicted an increased expression of proapoptotic genes Caspase 3,
Bax and Bid and concomitant decrease in antiapoptotic gene, Bcl-2.
(C) Representative image of immunoblot analysis confirmed the gene
expression in these cells at protein expression levels with an increase
in proapoptotic proteins BAX, as well as Annexin V.

The navitoclax active site of antiapoptotic BCL-2
protein for molecular
docking studies was evaluated to understand the basic interactions
with the active compounds (8, 28, and 29) among the series.30,31 In the case of compound 28, the carbonyl group of proline showed hydrogen bond with
bridged water molecule between Arg143 and Asn140; the carbonyl group
of valine residue depicted a similar kind of H-bond interaction with
Trp105 (Figure 4A).
Both the Oep and proline carbonyl group of compound 8 exhibited two hydrogen bonds (with distances of 1.97 and 2.54 Å)
with side chain of Arg104 at a P4 binding pocket of BCL-2 active site
(Figure 4B). Similarly,
the terminal carbonyl group of compound 29 had two side-chain
hydrogen bonds (with distances of 2.21 and 2.58 Å) with Arg104,
and the another terminal portion was found to be accommodated at P2
domain. The aliphatic chain of both compounds 28 and 29 was found to be occupying the P2 binding groove (Figure
S1 see Supporting Information).

(C) CETSA depicting stabilization of BCL-2 in the presence of compounds 8, 29, and 28 at higher temperature

To further support the in silico
molecular docking of BCL-2, an
antiapoptotic protein with compounds 8, 29, and 28 findings, we performed cellular thermal shift
assay (CETSA) to elucidate the binding of these compounds to BCL-2
in DU-145 cells. CETSA evaluates the binding of a
ligand or a small molecule to its target protein that leads to increased
target protein stabilization at differential temperature, as described
earlier.32,33 Optimum BCL-2 stabilization by compounds 8, 29, and/or 28 binding was observed
till 46 °C (Figure 4C). Cells were treated with 8, 29, and 28 and depicted BCL-2 expression at 50 °C as compared
to unbound protein in vehicle-treated cells. The significant shift
in melting temperatures of BCL-2 and its stabilization upon the addition
of 8, 29, and 28 indicated
that jahanyne congeners may be binding to this antiapoptotic protein
(BCL-2).

In summary, we have synthesized pruned congeners of
jahanyne using
simple and scalable steps. Mechanistic studies indicated that BCL-2
inhibition could be the reason for apoptotic activity of the molecules.
The dismal biological activity of desmethyl jahanyne substantiated
the observation that N-methylation plays a critical role in the activity
of the molecule. Further applications of BCL-2 inhibition in the therapeutic
areas of treatment of autoimmune diseases and parasites such as Schistosoma will be explored.

3 General
Information
Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were used
as received from
commercial suppliers. All nonaqueous reactions were performed under
an atmosphere of nitrogen using an oven-dried glassware and a standard
syringe in septa techniques. All solvents were dried before use, following
the standard procedures. Reactions were monitored using thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) (SiO2). TLC plates were visualized
with UV light (254 nm), iodine treatment, or using ninhydrin stain.
Column chromatography was carried out using silica gel (100–200
mesh) packed in glass columns. NMR spectra were recorded at 300, 400,
500 MHz (H) and at 75, 101, 126 MHz (C). Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in parts per million, using the residual solvent peak
in CDCl3 (H: δ = 7.26 and C: δ = 77.16 ppm)
as an internal standard, and coupling constants (J) are given in hertz. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was
recorded using electrospray
ionization (ESI)–Time-of-flight techniques. All N-methyl amino acids were prepared according to the procedure
described in the literature.34−36

4 Biological
Data
4.1 Antiproliferative Activity of Compounds
Sulforhodamine B assay was performed to evaluate the effect of
antiproliferative activity of synthesized analogues in various human
tissue-specific cancer cell lines breast-MDA-MB-231, prostate-DU-145, lung-A549, cervical-HeLa and control cell line, primary human embryonic kidney
cell line-HEK-293. Among these cell lines, DU-145 depicted higher sensitivity toward the synthesized
analogues of all the compounds evaluated; compounds 28, 8, and 29 were observed to be effective
against all the cancer cell types with IC50 values ranging
between 0.15 and 3.15 μM. Doxorubicin, a standard drug, was
used as a positive control. These compounds rendered ineffective against HEK-293 (IC50 ≥ 100 μM), suggesting
their nontoxic property against normal cells.

4.2 Effect
of Compounds on Cell Cycle Profile
Cell cycle analysis was
performed on DU-145 as
described in the methods using PI staining. The results depicted an
increase in the G0/G1 arrest in cells treated with compounds 28, 8, and 29 as compared to vehicle control.

4.3 Effect of Compounds on Apoptotic Gene Expression
Gene
expression studies were performed with a semiquantitative
RT-PCR. Briefly, DU-145 cells were treated with compounds
at 1 μM concn for 24 h. Proapoptotic genes, Bax and Bid as well
as Caspase-3, a programmed cell death marker, were found to be highly
expressed in compounds 28, 8, and 29 as compared to vehicle control. BCL-2, an antiapoptotic
gene expression, was very low to absent in cells treated with compounds 28, 8, and 29 compounds, suggesting
a proapoptotic role of these compounds.

4.4 Effect
of Compounds on Apoptotic Protein Expression
Antiapoptotic
protein marker, BCL-2 expression, was low, whereas
proapoptotic marker, BAX and Annexin V, was highly expressed in DU-145 cells treated with compounds 28, 8, and 29 as well as doxorubicin (positive control)
when compared with vehicle control. Compound 9 was found
to be active against all the cell lines at 1 μM concn except
for HEK-293. These results indicate that Oep moiety is a major contributor
to the antiapoptotic activity of compounds synthesized.

5.3 (S)-6,10-Dimethylundec-9-enal
(11)
DMP (6.4 g, 15.1 mmol) was added at 0 °C
under nitrogen to a solution of alcohol 10 (2.0 g, 10.1
mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 mL). The resulting mixture
was stirred at rt for 1 h. A 1:1 saturated NaHCO3/Na2S2O3 solution (20 mL) was then added;
the aqueous phase was separated and extracted with CH2Cl2 (100 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated. Purification
