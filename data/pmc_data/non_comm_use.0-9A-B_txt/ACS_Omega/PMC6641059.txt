The mechanisms of photoextrusion
reactions are determined theoretically
for the model system of six-coordinated M(CO)5(CS) (M =
Cr, Mo, and W), using both CASSCF and MP2-CAS methods and the Def2-SVPD
basis set. Three types of elimination reaction pathways (i.e., path
I, path II, and path III for axial CO extrusion, equatorial CO extrusion,
and CS ligand extrusion, respectively) are considered in this study.
Theoretical findings show that the photoextrusion mechanism for Cr
and Mo complexes proceeds as follows: M-S0-Rea + hν → M-S1-FC → M-CI →
M-Pro + CO. This study shows that when the reactant, M(CO)5(CS) (M-S0-Rea), is photoirradiated by UV light, it is
excited vertically to many low-lying singlet excited states. It then
relaxes to the first singlet excited state from the Franck–Condon
point (M-S1-FC). After passing through a conical intersection
point (M-CI), this species eliminates a CO group to yield a five-coordinated
product, M(CO)4(CS) (M-S0-Pro). However, for
the W analogue, the photolysis mechanism is represented as W-S0-Rea + hν → W-T1-Min
→ W-T1-TS → W-T1/S0 → W-S0-Pro + CO. That is to say, when the reactant,
W(CO)5(CS) (W-S0-Rea), absorbs UV light, it
is excited to its several low-lying excited states by a vertical excitation.
This species may then return to an intermediate at the first triplet
excited state (W-T1-Min) by means of intersystem crossings
or conical intersections. After passing through a triplet transition
state (W-T1-TS) and a subsequent intersystem crossing (W-T1/S0), this molecule finally loses a CO ligand to
produce a photoproduct at the ground singlet state (W-S0-Pro). In other words, conical intersections and intersystem crossings
play a decisive role in these photoextrusion reactions for M(CO)5(CS). Theoretical evidence from a kinetic viewpoint strongly
supports the theory that the photolysis of M(CO)5(CS) only
produces CO-loss photoproducts rather than the CS-loss photoproduct.
Theoretical analysis using the results of this study allows a good
interpretation of the available experimental observations.

I Introduction
There
has long been interest in the 18-electron metal hexacarbonyl
complexes, M(CO)6 (M = group 6 transition metal),1−18 partly because they can be photoinduced as a five-coordinate intermediate,
M(CO)5, which plays an important role in many related photochemical
reactions.19−33 Turner, Poliakoff, and co-workers reported that irradiation with
UV light causes the octahedral M(CO)6 complex to separate,
to produce one CO molecule and one M(CO)5 fragment.34−38 Similar experimental phenomena are also observed in the photochemistry
of pentacarbonyl thiocarbonyl complexes, M(CO)5(CS) (M
= Cr and W), which are summarized in a review.39 This study initially postulated that if the CS group is
a label, then the photochemistry of M(CO)5(CS) must be
closely analogous to that of M(CO)6, which, in turn, clarifies
the photochemical mechanisms for M(CO)6. It has been experimentally
reported that photolysis of these thiocarbonyl metal complexes in
the inert matrices using UV light generates a mixture of the two isomers
of M(CO)4(CS) (M = Cr and W) that exhibit a square-pyramidal
structure and one carbon monoxide molecule.34−39 See Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Experimental Results
See refs (34−39).

There have been no further experimental
or theoretical studies
of the photochemical reaction mechanisms for these six-coordinate
M(CO)5(CS) complexes, possibly because the experimental
equipment is not sufficiently accurate to determine the spin state
of the octahedral complexes from which these originate, and partly
because theoretical methods and computers have not been sufficiently
developed to allow the computations. This study undertakes a systematic
investigation of the photoextrusion reactions for metal thiocarbonyls
of chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten using sophisticated computational
methods. See Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Three Possible Photochemical Reaction Pathways
These photochemical reactions pertain to the
excited potential
energy surfaces. Therefore, the way in which these excited molecules
from high-energy excited energy states undergo a radiation-less decay
to the lowest-lying ground state has been of interest to both experimental
and theoretical chemists for many years.40 Conical intersections,41,42 which correspond to
crossings between states of the same multiplicity (generally singlet–singlet),
and intersystem crossings, which are crossings between states of different
multiplicity (most commonly triplet–singlet),43 provide very effective channels for the chemical deactivation
of photoexcited molecules. This study locates either the conical intersection
or the intersystem crossing regions on the potential surface, where
decay to the ground-state surface can occur. Using this information,
the photoextrusion reaction processes for M(CO)5(CS) complexes
are interpreted. It is worthy of note that this study focuses on the
photochemical behavior for both chromium and molybdenum complexes,
following excitation at 300 nm. It concentrates on the lowest accessible
excited state for the tungsten complex because of its high spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) effect. However, it has to be pointed out that even
very small SOC effects are still enough for promoting efficient intersystem
crossing. For instance, the kinetics of intersystem crossing in complexes
containing Fe, or Ru, or Re elements are very similar, and that the
heavy atom effect does not operate.44

This combination of available experimental results34−38 and theoretical study should increase understanding
of the excited
state behaviors of six-coordinate pentacarbonyl thiocarbonyl complexes,
M(CO)5(CS) (M = Cr, Mo, and W), which will also provide
a better understanding of the photolysis mechanisms for other photochemical
carbonyl elimination reactions of transition metal complexes.45

II Results and Discussion
II.I Mechanisms for the Photolysis Reactions for
Cr(CO)5(CS)
The photochemical reaction mechanisms
for Cr(CO)5(CS) (Cr-S0-Rea) are initially studied.
Several experimental studies46−50 have shown that only chromium or molybdenum undergo optical population
of the singlet state in group 6 transition metal complexes because
the effect of SOC is less than that for the tungsten complexes.49,50 Therefore, this study focuses on the singlet-excited states for
both chromium and molybdenum complexes and conical intersections41,42 are used to interpret the mechanisms for photochemical isomerization.

It has to be mentioned here that this study states that the SOC
is only significant for the tungsten system and not for the chromium
or the molybdenum systems. However, it has to be noted that this is
not universally accepted. The supporting evidence comes from an experimental
study by Harris and co-workers that was published in 2014.48 However, in 2015, Pryce et al. failed to experimentally
detect any triplet states for the chromium–Fischer carbene,
but it was experimentally observed that the lowest energy triplet
state plays a key role in the photochemistry of the tungsten–Fischer
carbene.49 The results of these experiments
show that both Cr and Mo complexes originate from a singlet-excited
state, and the W complex starts from a triplet excited state.

As shown in Scheme 2, three types of reaction routes are possible on the singlet excited
potential energy surface of Cr-S0-Rea. Path I and path
II lead to the final corresponding photoisomers (Cr-S0-Pro-1
and Cr-S0-Pro-2), whereby a CS group occupies the axial
and equatorial positions. Path III only results in a CS-loss photoproduct
(Cr-S0-Pro-3). Figure 1 shows the computational results for these three reaction
pathways and the relative energies for the various points with respect
to the energy of the corresponding reactant, Cr-S0-Rea.
The geometrical structures of the various points on the three mechanistic
pathways that are shown in Figure 1 are detailed in Figure 2.

Figure 1 Energy profiles for the photoextrusion reactions for Cr(CO)5(CS) (Cr-S0-Rea). The abbreviations, FC and CI,
respectively, represent Franck–Condon and conical intersection.
The relative energies are given at the MP2-CAS-(12,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD
level of theory. All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect
to the reactant (Cr-S0-Rea). For the crucial points of
the CASSCF optimized structures, see Figure 2. For more information, see the text.

deg) for path I,
path II, and path III, for Cr(CO)5(CS) (Cr-S0-Rea), the conical intersection (CI), and the isomer products (Pro).
The derivative coupling and the gradient difference vectors are computed
using CASSCF at the conical intersections, Cr-CI-1, Cr-CI-2, and Cr-CI-3.
The corresponding CASSCF vectors are shown in the inset.

Earlier experimental studies34−39 have shown that the photolysis of Cr-S0-Rea proceeds
when there is irradiation with UV light with a wavelength of 300 nm
(=95 kcal/mol). As shown on the left-hand side of Figure 1, the MP2-CAS results demonstrate
that the singlet excited state energy in the Franck–Condon
region (Cr-S1-FC) is 89 kcal/mol, which is in reasonable
agreement with the available experimental observations.34−39 The MP2-CAS data also shows that the triplet excited state energy
for the Franck–Condon geometry for Cr-S0-Rea is
about 98 kcal/mol (=291 nm). It is worthy of note that unlike most
photochemical reactions for organic molecules, the differences between
the energy levels are small for organometallic compounds because the
energy splitting of the d orbitals of the central transition-metal
atom that are involved is quite small. Therefore, for many photoextrusion
reactions for organometallic molecules, when light is absorbed, the
species can jump to the low-lying unoccupied orbitals, from which
it may produce several nearly degenerate states (such as metal-to-ligand
charge-transfer (MLCT) and metal-centered (MC) states), and then relax
through the conical intersection in the proximity of the Franck–Condon
region.18,48−56 The photochemical carbonyl elimination reactions for the d6 M(CO)5(CS) series that is also a subject of this study
exhibit similar phenomena.52−56 The photodissociation reaction for Cr(CO)6 is an example.
The experimental work on the photodynamics of Cr(CO)6 can
be found in references (3, 13, 33, 50, 51, 56, 61), and (64). It was
found that after Cr(CO)6 is irradiated by light, it can
proceed to a 1T1u (MLCT) state, followed by
ultrafast internal conversion to the nearly degenerate a 1T1g (MC) state because there is a conical intersection
in the proximity of the Franck–Condon region. However, no MLCT
states were computed in this study. For details, see references (18) and (50). Other papers concern
vertical state assignments on binary metal carbonyls (see refs (52−56)).

Considering these computational results and the nature of
the photodissociative
starting point, it is determined that the photolysis of Cr-S0-Rea finally occurs from a singlet excited state in the FC region
(Cr-S1-FC), which is in agreement with some experimental
observations48−51 and supports the theory that the first excited state of the chromium
complexes is a singlet, possibly because it exhibits weak SOC. It
has to be mentioned here that our computations demonstrate that for
the chromium system, the lowest triplet state (Cr-T1-Min)
significantly lies above the lowest energy singlet state (Cr-S0-Rea) by about 59 kcal/mol, as shown in Figure 1. However, this triplet state (Cr-T1-Min) is not accessible from the singlet ground state following excitation
due to the reason stated above.

When the reactant, Cr-S0-Rea, is photoirradiated by
UV light, this species goes to the photoexcited Cr-S1-FC.
Subsequently, this molecule undergoes a radiation-less decay to the
singlet ground state by way of an S1/S0 conical
intersection point. Beginning from the Cr-S1-FC excited
state for Cr(CO)5(CS), the photochemically dynamic relaxation
route can take one of three pathways: S1/S0 Cr-CI-1
(path I), S1/S0 Cr-CI-2 (path II), and S1/S0 CI-I-3 (path III), all of which are shown at
the center of Figure 1. The MP2-CAS computations show that Cr-CI-1 and Cr-CI-2 are, respectively,
lower in energy than Cr-S1-FC by 28 and 24 kcal/mol, but
the other competing Cr-CI-3 is 2.3 kcal/mol higher in energy than
its absorbing energy (300 nm = 95.3 kcal/mol). The geometrical structures
at these conical intersections are shown in Figure 2. Therefore, this theoretical study anticipates
that the photoextrusion reactions for both path I (Cr-S0-Rea + hν → Cr-S0-Pro1 +
CO) and path II (Cr-S0-Rea + hν → Cr-S0-Pro2 + CO) are barrier-less. Beginning from the Cr-S1-FC point, the six-coordinated Cr(CO)5(CS) complex
enters two very efficient decay channels: Cr-CI-1 and Cr-CI-2. After
decay at these conical intersection points, the final five-coordinated
complexes, Cr-S0-Pro1 and Cr-S0-Pro2, and the
initial reactant, Cr-S0-Rea, are obtained via a ground-state
barrier-less relaxation pathway. From an energetic viewpoint, it is
unlikely that a pentacarbonyl chromium, Cr(CO)5 and one
CS molecule (i.e., path III) are formed after UV photolysis of Cr(CO)5CS. That is to say, the Cr(CO)5CS complex cannot
lose a CS compound to yield a five-coordinate Cr(CO)5 molecule
via the S0 → S1 (300 nm) photoexcitation
reaction, followed by the conical intersection channel. As mentioned
previously, Turner, Poliakoff, and co-workers confirmed these theoretical
observations but failed to experimentally generate the CS-loss product
(Cr-Pro-3) by UV photoirradiation of Cr(CO)5CS.34−39

The CAS-MP2 computational results that are shown in Figure 1 demonstrate that
the photoextrusion
reaction for the octahedral Cr(CO)5(CS) complex progresses
as follows      

II.II Mechanisms
for the Photolysis Reactions
for Mo(CO)5(CS)
The mechanisms for the photochemical
reaction for the pentacarbonyl thiocarbonyl molybdenum complex, Mo(CO)5(CS), Mo-S0-Rea, are then studied. Similar to the
case for Cr-S0-Rea, the photoextrusion results for Mo-S0-Rea, which are summarized in Figure 3, are almost the same as those that are shown
in Figure 1. The geometrical
structures of the various key points on the three possible mechanistic
pathways in Figure 3 are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 3 Energy profiles for the photoextrusion reactions for Mo(CO)5(CS) (Mo-S0-Rea). The abbreviations, FC and CI,
respectively, represent Franck–Condon and conical intersection.
The relative energies are given at the MP2-CAS-(12,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD
level of theory. All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect
to the reactant (Mo-S0-Rea). For the CASSCF optimized structures
for the crucial points, see Figure 4. For more information, see the text.

Figure 4 CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD geometries (in Å and deg) for
path I,
path II, and path III for Mo(CO)5(CS) (Mo-S0-Rea), the conical intersection (CI) and the isomer products (Pro).
The derivative coupling and gradient difference vectors are computed
using CASSCF at the conical intersections, Mo-CI-1, Mo-CI-2, and Mo-CI-3.
The corresponding CASSCF vectors are shown in the inset.

The MP2-CAS calculations show that the vertical
excitation energy
for the promotion of Mo-S0-Rea to its excited singlet state
(Mo-S1-FC) is 81 kcal/mol. The same level of calculation
also predicts that the energy of its excited triplet state (Mo-T1-FC) is 16 kcal/mol higher than that of Mo-S1-FC,
as shown on the left-hand side of Figure 3. This theoretical evidence confirms previous
experimental results that the SOC is weak for the molybdenum system.48−51 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there have been no
experimental reports concerning the photolysis reactions of Mo(CO)5(CS), so the value of this FC energy is a prediction. The
wavenumber (300 nm) of the UV light of Cr(CO)5(CS) is used
as a reference line in the potential energy surfaces’ diagram
of the Mo complex that is shown in Figure 3. Similar to the Cr(CO)5(CS) photolysis
reactions,18,48−56 the photoexcitation promotes Mo(CO)5(CS) to a series
of low-lying excited states (e.g., MC and MLCT), from where it can
undergo ultrafast internal conversion to the S1 state from
the FC point (Mo-S1-FC). The photoelimination reactions
for Mo(CO)5(CS) then proceed on singlet surfaces. The computational
data, however, indicate that for the Mo(CO)5(CS) complex,
the lowest triplet state (Mo-T1-Min) lies apparently above
the lowest energy singlet state (Mo-S0-Rea) by about 54
kcal/mol, as shown in Figure 3. Again, due to the weak SOC for the molybdenum system mentioned
above, it is foreseen that the triplet Mo-T1-Min state
is not accessible from the singlet Mo-S0-Rea state following
excitation.

Using the theoretical computations that are shown
in Figure 3, the photoextrusion
mechanisms
for the reactant, Mo-S0-Rea, for two reaction pathways
(path I and path II), can be represented as    The MP2-CAS computational
results show that
the energies of Mo-CI-1 and Mo-CI-2 are 71 and 68 kcal/mol, relative
to the corresponding reactant (Mo-S0-Rea), but these are,
respectively, 10 and 13 kcal/mol lower in energy than Mo-S1-FC. These theoretical observations predict that the photoextrusion
reactions for both path I and path II are barrier-less. From the initial
FC point (Mo-S1-FC), Mo-S0-Rea enters a productive
decay channel, either Mo-CI-1 or Mo-CI-2, and then decays from these
conical intersection points. The CO-loss products (Mo-S0-Pro1 and Mo-S0-Pro2, respectively) and the reactant (Mo-S0-Rea) are obtained via singlet barrier-less relaxations.

Similarly, the theoretical results in Figure 3 show that the photoextrusion reaction mechanism
for path III proceeds as  The CAS-MP2 computations
in Figure 3 show that
Mo-CI-3 is about
0.4 kcal/mol higher in energy than its absorbing energy (300 nm =
95.3 kcal/mol), which strongly implies that the singlet excited energy
for Mo-S0-Rea is insufficient to generate its photoproducts,
a five-coordinated Mo(CO)5 complex (Mo-Pro-3) and a CS
molecule, via the conical intersection channel.

These model
computations predict that both path I and path II are
preferable to path III, from a kinetic viewpoint. In particular, the
first two produce the CO-loss products, but the latter yields the
CS-loss product.

II.III Mechanisms for the Photolysis
Reactions
for W(CO)5(CS)
Finally, the photoextrusion reaction
mechanisms for the tungsten complex, W(CO)5(CS), W-S0-Rea, are considered. As previously mentioned because tungsten
exhibits greater SOC,46−51 it is possible for the W(CO)5(CS) complex to occupy triplet
states directly from the singlet ground state, unlike the other two
systems (Cr-S0-Rea and Mo-S0-Rea). The intersystem
crossing mechanisms are used to determine both the singlet and triplet
potential energy surfaces for W-S0-Rea, to determine how
the reactant (W-S0-Rea) starts on an excited electronic
potential surface and then crosses over to a lower surface somewhere
along the reaction pathway. This tungsten complex finally arrives
at the ground-state surface via a sequence of radiation-less transitions
(e.g., intersystem crossings) and then moves on the ground-state surface
toward the products. The three reaction profiles (path I, path II,
and path III) are shown in Figure 5, which also shows the relative energies for the important
points with respect to the ground-state minimum, W-S0-Rea. Figure 6 shows selected optimized
geometrical parameters for the critical points that are given in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Energy profiles for the
photoextrusion reactions for W(CO)5(CS) (W-S0-Rea). The abbreviations, FC, Min, TS
and Pro, respectively, represent Franck–Condon, intermediate,
transition state, and product. The relative energies are given at
the MP2-CAS-(12,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD level of theory.
All energies (in kcal/mol) are given with respect to the reactant
(W-S0-Rea). For the CASSCF optimized structures for the
crucial points, see Figure 6. For more information, see the text.

Figure 6 CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD geometries (in Å and deg) for path I,
path II, and path III for W(CO)5(CS) (W-S0-Rea),
the conical intersection (CI), the intermediate (Min), the transition
state (TS), and the isomer products (Pro). The gradient difference
vectors at the intersystem crossings (W-T1/S0-1, W-T1/S0-2, and W-T1/S0-3), which are computed using CASSCF, are shown in the inset.

The MP2-CAS calculations show
that the energies of the first excited
triplet and singlet states (in kcal/mol) are in the order: W-T1-FC (58) < W-S1-FC (96). Similar to Cr(CO)5(CS) (Figure 1) and Mo(CO)5(CS) (Figure 3), the six-coordinate W-S0-Rea complex is
initially promoted to its lowest-lying excited state via a vertical
excitation. This W complex then proceeds through ultrafast conical
intersections (or intersystem crossings) and finally decays to the
minimum point at the triplet first excited state, W-T1-Min.
The agreement between the experimental and theoretical data means
that the photoinduced W-S0-Rea complex originates from
the excited triplet surface, so the crossing between the triplet and
singlet states is a focus.34−39,49 It has to be mentioned that in Figure 5, both W-T1-TS1 and W-T1-TS2 are on the triplet excited states, and
they connect with W-T1-Min, which are the results of IRC
calculations for the reactant sides of these transition states. The
MP2-CAS computations that are schematically illustrated in Figure 5 show that in contrast
to the Cr-S0-Rea and the Mo-S0-Rea systems,
the photoextrusion reaction mechanisms for W-S0-Rea proceed
as      The MP2-CAS results
demonstrate that the photoirradiated
W-S0-Rea is promoted to its lowest-lying triplet excited
state by a vertical excitation and then relaxes to the triplet minimum
point, W-T1-Min. The triplet W(CO)5(CS) then
undergoes either CO-extrusion or CS-extrusion via the transition state.
The relative energies for these two processes with respect to the
energy of the corresponding reactant complex (W-S0-Rea)
(in kcal/mol) are in the order: W-T1-TS1 (53) < W-T1-TS2 (57) < W-T1-TS3 (73). Figure 5 also shows that these transition
states (W-T1-TS) connect the triplet local minimum, W-T1-Min, to the corresponding intersystem crossing points (W-T1/S0).

It is worthy of note that the six-coordinate
W(CO)5(CS)
complex originates from the excited triplet surface and finally moves
to the singlet ground-state route, so the spin crossover between the
triplet (T1) and singlet (S0) surfaces must
play a fundamental role in characterizing its mechanistic photoextrusion
reaction. As shown in Figure 5, the intersystem crossing from the T1 to the S0 states occurs at the T1/S0 intersection,
that is, W-T1/S0. The CASSCF optimized structures
and the gradient difference vectors for the W-T1/S0-1 (path I), W-T1/S0-2 (path II), and
W-T1/S0-3 (path III) points are given in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows that relaxation through
the intersystem crossing point creates a reaction pathway to the final
photoproducts, W-S0-Pro, on the singlet state surface,
via the gradient difference vector. In Figure 5, the MP2-CAS computations also show that
these intersystem crossing points lie about 49 (W-T1/S0-1), 49 (W-T1/S0-2), and 78 (W-T1/S0-3) kcal/mol above the energy of the corresponding
reactant, W-S0-Rea. Therefore, after UV photo-irradiation,
both path I and path II have sufficient internal energy to overcome
the barrier heights between the W-T1-Min intermediate and
the W-T1/S0-1 or W-T1/S0-2 intersection points. However, W-T1-TS3 and W-T1/S0-3 are, respectively, much higher in energy
than the other points on the reaction pathways of path I and path
II, which strongly supports the theory that pathways I and II are
energetically feasible, and pathway III is energetically unfavorable,
from a kinetic viewpoint. Therefore, UV photolysis of W(CO)5(CS) should produce a mixture of two isomeric forms of W(CO)4(CS) and molecular CO in large amounts, rather than the pentacarbonyl
W(CO)5 complex and CS. This result is in good agreement
with the experimental observations for the W(CO)5(CS) molecule.34−39

III Conclusions
The results for the three
six-coordinate pentacarbonyl thiocarbonyl
d6 transition metal systems studied allow the following
conclusions to be drawn:1. It is theoretically demonstrated that
the photolysis of M(CO)5(CS) (M = Cr, Mo, and W) proceeds
along three reaction pathways: path I, path II, and path III (Scheme 2). The former two
reaction routes produce one CO-loss photoproduct (M(CO)4(CS)) and the latter generates a CS-loss molecule (M(CO)5).

2. These theoretical
findings show that
on irradiation with UV light, both Cr(CO)5(CS) and Mo(CO)5(CS) complexes are excited to their singlet excited states,
and the W(CO)5(CS) compound is promoted to its triplet
excited state. From these spin states, conical intersection (S1/S0) and intersystem crossing (T1/S0) concepts are respectively used to interpret the mechanisms
for the photochemical reactions, which feature two different types
of spin states.

3. These
theoretical computations show
that after irradiation with UV light, irrespective of the central
d6 transition metal, M, the octahedral M(CO)5(CS) molecule follows either path I or path II to form a square-pyramidal
W(CO)4(CS) complex and one CO. However because this theoretical
evidence shows that either the conical intersection or the intersystem
crossing points for path III are too high in energy, it is anticipated
that path III is unfavorable, from the kinetic viewpoint. These conclusions,
which are based on the results of this theoretical analysis, agree
well with the experimental observations.34−39

4. The reason that path
III is never followed
could be due to the fact that the M–CS bond is basically much
stronger than the M–CO bond. For instance, according to the
available experimental works, mass spectroscopic studies give (CO)5M–CO bond dissociation energies of 36.8 ± 2 kcal/mol
for (CO)5Cr–CO, 40.5 ± 2 kcal/mol for (CO)5Mo–CO, and 46.0 ± 2 kcal/mol for (CO)5W–CO,57 whereas the experimental
bond strengths for (CO)5Cr–CS, (CO)5Mo–CS,
and(CO)5W–CS are reported to be 56 ± 4, 64
± 4, and 70 ± 8 kcal/mol.58,59

5. We have used the CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD
method to calculate the SOC between the ground state and the first
excited state for the chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten complex systems
studied in this work. Our computational data are as follows. The SOC
values increase in the order: Cr-S1-FC (3.7 cm–1) < Mo-S1-FC (5.4 cm–1) < W-S1-FC (221.6 cm–1), Cr-T1-FC (81.3
cm–1) < Mo-T1-FC (208.8 cm–1) < W-T1-FC (238.0 cm–1), and Cr-T1-Min (81.8 cm–1) < Mo-T1-Min
(207.6 cm–1) < W-T1-Min (662.9 cm–1). Again, these theoretical data verify the previous
belief57−61 that the effect of SOC for the tungsten complexes is always larger
than those for the corresponding chromium and molybdenum molecules.



IV Methodology
All
stationary points on the potential energy surfaces of excited
state and singlet ground states were computed using the GAUSSIAN 09
package of programs.63 We start from the
octahedral geometry, whose traditional molecular orbital energy diagram
for a d6 transition-metal complex has been published elsewhere.61−64 The complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) optimizations
are performed for the a1A′ electronic ground state
and some low-lying singlet A′ excited states. For instance,
using the CS symmetry (Figure 7), the a1A′ electronic
ground-state configuration of the Cr(CO)5(CS) complex conforms
to a closed shell occupation (53a′)2(54a″)2(55a′)2(56a″)2(57a′)2(58a″)2, which corresponds to the (σCS/z2)2(πCS/yz)2(πCS/xz)2(3dyz)2(3dxz)2(3dxy)2 configuration. Low-lying virtual orbitals
correspond to π*CS/3dxz(59a′), π*CS/3dyz(60a″), 3dz2/σ*CS(61a′), and 3dx2–y2(62a′). This study considers the
other two transition-metal complexes, Mo(CO)5(CS) and W(CO)5(CS), using the same orbital active space so these active
orbitals form a space of 12 electrons in 10 orbitals, which is denoted
as (12,10). The ground state CASSCF optimized geometry using the CASSCF
(12,10) active space has therefore been used to calculate the minima
and transition state energies. The optimization of conical intersections
is achieved in the (f – 2)-dimensional intersection space,
using the method of Bearpark et al.63 that is implemented in the Gaussian 09 program.60 The lowest energy points of T1/S0 surface crossing were optimized using the computational method
previously mentioned with state-average orbitals.65 For T1/S0 crossing, a weighting of
50/50% was chosen for the triplet and singlet states in the state-averaging
procedure.66

Figure 7 Valence molecular orbitals
of the M(CO)5(CS) (M = Cr,
Mo, and W) complex.

Geometry optimizations
are initially performed using the CASSCF
and the Def2-SVPD basis sets.67 This basis
set uses a split valence basis set, with one polarization function
and diffuse functions on all atoms. This is an all-electron basis
set for C, O, and Cr, Mo, and W are respectively treated as a 14-
and 14-electron system, and the relativistic effective core potentials
that are used are those that are published in the literature.68,69

When the prevailing electronic configurations are considered
for
the CASSCF calculations, dynamic correlation contributions are evaluated
using a second-order perturbation process (MP2-CAS),70,71 for which the CASSCF wave function is the reference function. Therefore,
all stationary points on the potential energy surfaces of either the
singlet or the triplet excited and the singlet ground states are computed
using the GAUSSIAN 09 package of programs60 at the CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD (geometries) and MP2-CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD//CAS(12,10)/Def2-SVPD
(energies) levels of theory. Cartesian coordinates that are computed
for the critical points at the CASSCF level are available as Supporting Information.
