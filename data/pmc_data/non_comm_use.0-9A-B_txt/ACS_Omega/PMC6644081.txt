Novel anion-conductive
polymers containing perfluoroalkyl and ammonium-functionalized
fluorene groups were synthesized and characterized. The quaternized
polymers synthesized using a dimethylaminated fluorene monomer had
a well-defined chemical structure in which each fluorenyl group was
substituted with two ammonium groups at specific positions. The resulting
polymers had a high molecular weight (Mn = 8.9–13.8 kDa, Mw = 13.7–24.5
kDa) to provide bendable thin membranes with the ion-exchange capacity
(IEC) ranging from 0.7 to 1.9 mequiv g–1 by solution
casting. Both transmission electron microscopy images and small-angle
X-ray scattering patterns suggested that the polymer membranes possessed
a nanoscale phase-separated morphology based on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic
differences in the polymer components. Unlike typical anion-exchange
membranes found in the literature, hydroxide ion conductivity of the
membranes did not increase with increasing IEC because of their high
swelling capability in water. The membrane with IEC = 1.2 mequiv g–1 showed balanced properties of high hydroxide ion
conductivity (81 mS cm–1 at 80 °C in water)
and mechanical strength (>100% elongation and 14 MPa maximum stress
at 80 °C, 60% relative humidity). The polymer main chains were
stable in 4 M KOH for 1000 h, whereas the trimethylbenzyl-type ammonium
groups degraded under the conditions to cause loss in the hydroxide
ion conductivity. An H2/O2 fuel cell with the
membrane with IEC = 1.2 mequiv g–1 exhibited a maximum
power density of 242 mW cm–2 at 580 mA cm–2 current density.

Introduction
Polymer electrolyte
fuel cell is one of the most attractive electrochemical
systems for energy conversion. In particular, proton-exchange membrane
fuel cells (PEMFCs) have already been commercialized for applications
in stationary cogeneration systems and electric vehicles. However,
the highly acidic PEMs require the use of precious metals such as
Pt as electrocatalysts, which makes the PEMFCs less cost-effective.1−3 In contrast, anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) have gained
growing attention because of the possible use of abundant non-platinum
group metals as electrocatalysts.4,5 However, the
chemical instability and low anion conductivity of the existing AEMs
have been major concerns for practical use.6−8 To address these
issues, a wide variety of aromatic polymers such as poly(arylene ether)s,9,10 polystyrenes,11,12 and poly(phenylene oxide)s13,14 functionalized with quaternary ammonium groups have been studied.
Among them, cardo structures such as fluorene and phenolphthalein
derivatives seem attractive as the scaffold for the ammonium groups
because multiple functionalization with ammonium groups is easily
achievable. Furthermore, the bulky structures enable the formation
of a large free volume in the membrane, which could serve as an ion-conducting
pathway.15−17 Previously, we have synthesized anion-conductive
polymers containing ammonium-functionalized fluorene groups via a
chloromethylation reaction.18 The effect
of the substitution number and position of ammonium groups on membrane
properties was investigated in detail, which showed that a membrane
having approximately two ammonium groups per fluorenyl group exhibited
optimum membrane properties such as a well-developed phase-separated
morphology, high hydroxide ion conductivity, and chemical stability.
However, since the harmful chloromethylation reaction often accompanies
unfavorable side reactions including the cross-linking reaction, the
detailed molecular structure for the optimum membrane properties remain
unclear. The objective of the present study was to synthesize a series
of partially fluorinated polymers containing ammonium-functionalized
fluorenyl groups with a well-defined structure. A preaminated monomer
was designed such that each fluorenyl group was substituted with two
ammonium groups at specific positions. The effect of the copolymer
composition or ion-exchange capacity (IEC) on the membrane properties
such as morphology, anion conductivity, mechanical strength, alkaline
stability, and fuel cell performance was investigated. The properties
were compared with those of our previously reported membranes prepared
via the chloromethylation method.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
of Monomer 1 and Polymers 2 and 3
Bis(dimethylaminomethyl)fluorenyl
monomer 1 was synthesized according to Scheme 1. First, p-BCF was chloromethylated with chloromethyl methyl ether (CMME) via
Friedel–Crafts reaction using TiCl4 as the Lewis
acid catalyst. Under optimized conditions, the reaction proceeded
quantitatively and regioselectively at the 2 and 7 positions (or 4
in p-BCF in Scheme 1) of fluorene groups as suggested by the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1). The chloromethylated compound (p-BCF-cm) was
aminated with dimethylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. Complete
amination reaction was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum,
where the methylene proton (6) appeared at a higher magnetic field
(3.4 ppm) compared with that of p-BCF-cm (4.6 ppm).
Methyl protons (7) appeared at 2.2 ppm.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Hydrophilic Monomer (1)
Synthesis of Quaternized
Polymer 4
The synthetic procedure
for the title quaternized polymer 4 is shown in Scheme 2. The precursor copolymer
(3) was synthesized by Ni-promoted polycondensation reaction
of the monomers 1 and 2. The reaction proceeded
successfully as confirmed by 1H and 19F NMR
spectra. In the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 2a), all peaks were well-assigned to the supposed
chemical structure. The copolymer composition estimated from the integral
peak ratios were in good accordance with those of the feed comonomer
ratios (Table 1). In
the 19F NMR spectrum (Figure S1a), three fluorine peaks were observed to confirm no side reactions
in the hydrophobic component. A series of copolymers (3) with different compositions (m:n) were obtained with high molecular weight (Mn = 8.9–13.8 kDa, Mw = 13.7–24.5
kDa) and reasonable polydispersity (1.5–2.1). The quaternization
reaction of 3 was carried out using dimethyl sulfate
in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc)
solution. The progress of the reaction was confirmed by the shift
of the methylene and methyl protons to the lower magnetic field in
the 1H NMR spectra (Figure 2b). The 19F NMR spectrum (Figure S1b) did not show evidences of any side reactions.
The resulting quaternized copolymer 4 was soluble in
polar organic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and DMAc,
and provided brown and transparent membranes by casting from DMAc
solution (thickness: 40–45 μm for 4-1, 50–70
μm for 4-2, 30–40 μm for 4-3, 30–40 μm for 4-4). The solvent solubility
and membrane-forming capability of the copolymers were better than
those of our previous copolymer membranes with a similar chemical
structure prepared via the chloromethylation method.18 Molecular weight measurements of 4 were unavailable
because of the strong interaction with our gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) columns. The IEC values of 4 membranes determined
by titration ranged from 0.7 to 1.9 mequiv g–1,
which were in fair agreement with those (0.7–1.7 mequiv g–1) calculated from the copolymer compositions obtained
from the 1H NMR spectra of 3.

Water Uptake
and Hydroxide Ion Conductivity
Water uptake
and hydroxide ion conductivity of 4 membranes are shown
in Figure 3. The water
uptake increased nearly proportional to IEC. The highest IEC membrane
(4-4) exhibited 152 wt % water uptake. The dimensional
changes of the 4-3 membrane were 24% (through-plane)
and negligibly small (in-plane), respectively. The conductivity also
increased with IEC up to IEC = 1.2 mequiv g–1 (47
mS cm–1), and then decreased to 41 mS cm–1 with further increase in IEC. Taking the absorbed water into account,
practical IEC values in water were 0.57 mequiv g–1 for 4-1, 0.79 mequiv g–1 for 4-2, 0.87 mequiv g–1 for 4-3, and 0.65 mequiv g–1 for 4-4 membranes,
respectively, which explains the dependence of the conductivity on
IEC. The 4-3 membrane with IEC = 1.2 mequiv g–1 showed the best balanced properties with the highest conductivity
(47 mS cm–1) and a reasonably low water uptake (59%).

of (a) water uptake at room temperature (soaked
in water for 24 h) and (b) OH– conductivity of 4 membranes in water at 30 °C.

Temperature dependence of the OH– conductivity
in water is shown in Figure 4. All samples showed an approximate Arrhenius-type temperature
dependence of the conductivity up to 80 °C. The apparent activation
energies for the ion conduction calculated from the slopes were 7.1
kJ mol–1 for 4-1, 9.9 kJ mol–1 for 4-2, 10 kJ mol–1 for 4-3, and 8.2 kJ mol–1 for 4-4. These
values were similar and comparable to those of our previous anion-conductive
membranes18 and typical for the conduction
of hydrated hydroxide ions.

Figure 4 Temperature dependence of OH– conductivity of 4 membranes.

Morphology
The morphology of 4 membranes
was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 5). The membranes
showed a phase-separated morphology with small hydrophobic (bright
areas) and hydrophilic (dark areas) domains. The domain sizes were
both ca. 4–5 nm in all membranes. Compared with our previous
membrane (5–8 nm) prepared via the chloromethylation method
followed by quaternization,18 the domain
sizes and their distribution were slightly smaller. The results suggest
that casting from quaternized polymers could provide membranes with
more homogeneous morphologies than those of the membranes that were
quaternized afterward.

Figure 5 TEM images of (a) 4-1 (b) 4-2 (c) 4-3, and (d) 4-4 membranes in PtCl4– forms.

Then, effect of the humidity on the morphology of 4 membranes was investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
analyses (Figure 6).
At 30% relative humidity (RH), the membranes showed a clear scattering
peak at q = 0.54 nm–1 or d = 11.6 nm for 4-1, q = 0.66
nm–1 or d = 9.5 nm for 4-2, q = 0.69 nm–1 or d = 9.1 nm for 4-3, and q = 0.75 nm–1 or d = 8.4 nm for 4-4. The peak became larger in intensity and the d spacing
also became larger with increasing humidity; q =
0.53 nm–1 or d = 11.9 nm for 4-1, q = 0.64 nm–1 or d = 9.8 nm for 4-2, q = 0.63
nm–1 or d = 10.0 nm for 4-3, and q = 0.72 nm–1 or d = 8.7 nm for 4-4 at 90% RH, respectively.
Development of the peak on increasing the water uptake suggests that
it is associated with periodic hydrophilic domains. The d-spacings observed in SAXS curves were larger than the cluster sizes
in the TEM images because of the swelling with the absorbed water.
The well-ordered periodic structure of the hydrophilic domains could
be responsible for the high hydroxide ion conductivity of the membranes
in water. The d-spacing decreased (Figure S2) and the peak became prominent with increasing IEC
at both humidities. In the higher IEC membranes, smaller hydrophilic
domains with homogeneous size were more likely to form.

of (a) 4-1 (b) 4-2 (c) 4-3 (d) 4-4 membranes in Cl– forms at 40 °C,
30–90% RH.

Mechanical Properties
Mechanical properties of the
membranes were evaluated by tensile strength (Figure 7) and dynamic mechanical analyses (Figure 8). The 4-1 membrane with a lower molecular weight was not available because
of the insufficient strength for the analyses. Other membranes (4-2, 4-3, and 4-4) showed high elongation
(>100%) at 80 °C and 60% RH. The 4-2 and 4-3 membranes showed reasonably high maximum stress (15 and
14 MPa,
respectively); however, the 4-4 membrane with the highest
IEC showed the lowest maximum stress (8 MPa) because of its highest
water absorbability. In DMA analyses, three 4 membranes
showed similar curves. The storage modulus E′
decreased with increasing temperature, and a broad peak was observed
in the loss modulus E″ at ca. 70 °C.
The peak would be associated with the glass transition of the polymers.
Since the transition temperature was similar among the membranes with
different IEC values (and thus, different water contents), it is presumably
related to the hydrophobic components. The DMA properties of 4 membranes were similar to those of our previously reported
membranes prepared via the chloromethylation method.18

60% RH.

Thermal and Alkaline Stability
The thermal stability
of the 4-3 membrane (in Cl– form) was
measured by thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S3). Two-step weight loss was observed. The initial weight
loss from 150 °C was ca. 10% corresponding to the amount of NMe3Cl groups (decomposition of the ammonium groups), whereas
the second weight loss above ca. 400 °C would be due to the main
chain degradation. The alkaline stability of the 4-3 membrane
(in OH– form) was evaluated in 1 and 4 M KOH at
80 °C (Figure 9). The hydroxide ion conductivity of the membrane decreased with
testing time and the decrease was faster in 4 M KOH than in 1 M KOH.
After 1000 h, the conductivity was 15 mS cm–1 (1
M KOH) and 13 mS cm–1 (4 M KOH) (the remaining percentage
was 28 and 25%), respectively. The IEC of the postmortem membrane
determined by titration also decreased to 0.7 mequiv g–1 under both conditions. Although the postmortem membrane retained
bendability, it was insoluble in organic solvents. In the IR spectrum
of the postmortem membrane (Figure 10), the peak around 1600 cm–1 assigned
to the C–H stretching vibration of methyl groups and the peak
around 900 cm–1 assigned to the C–N+ stretching vibration were smaller. The changes suggest the chemical
degradation of the ammonium groups and are not contradictory to the
losses in the ion conductivity and IEC. Since the large peaks at 1100–1200
cm–1 assignable to C–F symmetric and asymmetric
stretching vibration did not change, the polymer main chain seemed
intact. The postmortem membrane was subjected to morphological analyses
via SAXS (Figure 11), in which humidity dependence of the scattering peaks was not observed.
The results suggest that the decomposition of the ammonium groups
(loss of IEC) eventually hampered morphological development in the
quaternized membranes, and both of these caused decreased hydroxide
ion conductivity.

Fuel Cell Performance
A catalyst-coated membrane was
prepared with the 4-3 membrane (37 μm thick), our
homemade QPAF-4 ionomer,20 and the Pt/CB
catalyst for the anode and cathode. The fuel cell was operated at
60 °C by supplying fully humidified pure H2 and O2 gases at a flow rate of 100 mL min–1 to
the anode and the cathode, respectively. The current density/voltage
(I/V) and current density/power
density (I/W) curves, and ohmic
resistance of the fuel cell are shown in Figure 12. The fuel cell showed a relatively high
open circuit voltage (OCV, 0.96 V) typical for an H2/O2 alkaline fuel cell. The ohmic resistance was ca. 0.15 Ω
cm2, which was approximately three times higher than the
area-specific resistance of the membrane (0.05 Ω cm2) calculated from the hydroxide ion conductivity (67 mS cm–1 in water at 60 °C, Figure 4) and the thickness. The difference in the resistance
could be due to the lower hydroxide ion conductivity of the membrane
under humidified conditions than in water. The contact resistance
between the membrane and the catalyst layers could also be responsible
to some extent. The fuel cell achieved high maximum power densities
of 242 mW cm–2 at a current density of 580 mA cm–2.

Conclusions
A
series of copolymers containing perfluoroalkyl and ammonium-functionalized
fluorenyl groups were synthesized and characterized. Compared with
our recent anion-exchange membranes with a similar chemical structure
prepared via chloromethylation (which often accompanied unfavorable
side reactions), the present copolymer membranes had better solubility
in organic solvents and membrane-forming capability. Because of the
well-defined hydrophilic structure where each fluorenyl group was
substituted with two ammonium groups, the resulting polymer membranes
exhibited a well-ordered phase-separated morphology as suggested by
TEM images and SAXS analyses. The copolymer membranes exhibited a
hydroxide ion conductivity that was less dependent on the gravimetric
ion-exchange capacity (IEC) of the dry membranes, which was well-understood
taking absorbed water into account. The optimum IEC value of the copolymer
membranes was found to be 1.2 mequiv g–1 considering
water uptake, hydroxide ion conductivity, and mechanical properties.
In the accelerated alkaline stability test, the polymer main chain
with no heteroatom linkages was stable; however, the trimethyl benzylammonium
groups degraded to cause some losses in the ion conductivity. The
hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell was operable under fully humidified conditions
to obtain a high OCV and low ohmic resistance, as expected from the
membrane properties. Using better-performing catalysts in alkaline
media would further enhance the fuel cell’s performance.

Titanium(IV) chloride (16–17% as Ti
in dil. hydrochloric acid, Wako Chemical), chloromethyl methyl ether
(CMME) (>95%, TCI), 40 wt % dimethylamine aqueous solution (Kanto
Chemical), tetrahydrofuran (>99.5% Kanto Chemical), hydrochloric
acid
(35–37%, Kanto Chemical), 2,2′-bipyridine (>99%,
TCI),
bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) (Ni(cod)2) (>95%, Kanto
Chemical), and dimethyl sulfate (>99%, Kanto Chemical) were used
as
received. N,N-dimethylacetamide
(DMAc) (>99%, Kanto Chemical) was dehydrated over molecular sieve
4A prior to use. 9,9′-Bis(4-chlorophenyl)fluorene (p-BCF) and bis(3-chlorophenyl)perfluorohexane (2) were synthesized
according to the literature.18 1,6-Diiodoperfluorohexane
was kindly supplied by Tosoh Finechem Co.

Synthesis of 2,7-Bis(chloromethyl)-9,9-bis(4-chlorophenyl)fluorene
(p-BCF-cm)
A 100 mL one-neck round-bottomed
flask equipped with a condenser, a nitrogen inlet/outlet, and a magnetic
stirring bar was charged with p-BCF (5.00 g, 12.9
mmol), carbon disulfide (30 mL), and CMME (6.5 mL). To this mixture,
titanium(IV) chloride (2.8 mL) in carbon disulfide (6 mL) was added
to obtain a brown mixture solution. Stirring for 1 h at room temperature
(rt) made the reaction mixture yellow. The reaction was monitored
with TLC to confirm complete reaction. The reaction mixture was diluted
with dichloromethane and a small amount of methanol, and filtered
to remove the precipitate. The filtrate was evaporated and then purified
by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/dichloromethane
= 3:1). The obtained solution was evaporated to obtain a white powder
(2.66 g, 42% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3):
δ 4.58 (s, 2H), 7.09 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 1H), 7.22
(d, J = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.33 (s, 1H), 7.42 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 1H), 7.74 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H).

Synthesis of 2,7-Bis(dimethylaminomethyl)-9,9-bis(4-chlorophenyl)fluorene

A 100 mL one-neck round-bottomed flask equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with p-BCF-cm
(2.00 g, 4.13 mmol), 40% dimethylamine aqueous solution (5.6 mL),
and THF (40 mL). After stirring for 18 h at rt, the reaction mixture
was extracted with dichloromethane three times, and then the combined
organic layer was washed with sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and
water twice. The organic layer was evaporated to obtain a white powder
(1.68 g, 81% yield). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3):
δ 2.20 (s, 3H) 3.41 (s, 2H) 7.11–7.7.12 (m, 1H) 7.16–7.19
(m, 1H) 7.24 (s, 1H) 7.30 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 1H) 7.68
(d, J = 6.6 Hz, 1H).

Synthesis of Precursor
Copolymers (3)
A typical synthetic procedure
for the precursor copolymers is as
follows: a 100 mL three-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a
condenser and a nitrogen inlet/outlet was charged with 1 (0.550 g, 1.1 mmol), 2 (1.80 g, 3.4 mmol), 2,2′-bipyridine
(1.42 g, 9.1 mmol), and DMAc (18 mL). The mixture was heated at 80
°C to obtain a homogeneous mixture. To the mixture, Ni(cod)2 (2.50 g, 9.1 mmol) was added and the reaction was continued
for 3 h at 80 °C. The reaction mixture was poured into 300 mL
of methanol to precipitate a black powder. The crude product was washed
with concentrated hydrochloric acid (300 mL) and then treated with
saturated potassium carbonate aqueous solution (300 mL) two times.
The resulting white powder was washed with deionized water two times,
and dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven overnight to obtain1.6 g
of 3 (m:n = 1.00:0.37)
in 74% yield.

Quaternization of 3 and Membrane Preparation
A typical
procedure is as follows. A 50 mL round-bottomed flask was charged
with 3 (1.50 g, 0.91 mmol of dimethylamino groups) and
DMAc (10 mL). After dissolution of 3, dimethyl sulfate
(3 mL, 32 mmol) was added. The mixture was stirred at 40 °C for
48 h, and then diluted with DMAc (10 mL). The mixture was poured into
water (200 mL) to precipitate a white fibrous solid. The crude product
was washed with water (200 mL) two times. The white solid was dissolved
into 10 mL of DMAc and the solution was filtered with a syringe stuffed
with cotton. The filtrate was cast onto a flat glass plate and dried
at 50 °C overnight to obtain a pale brown transparent membrane.
The resulting membrane was immersed in 1 M KOH aqueous solution for
24 h at 80 °C and then the membrane in OH– form
was washed with degassed water for 1 day to remove the excess KOH.
The membrane in Cl– form was prepared by soaking
the OH– form membrane in 1 M HCl aqueous solution
at 40 °C for 48 h.

Measurements
Characterization and
property measurements
