Glucagon-like peptide-1
(GLP-1) is an incretin peptide that plays
a crucial role in lowering blood glucose levels and holds promise
for treating type II diabetes. In this study, we synthesized GLP-1
derivatives that were conjugated with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), i.e.,
chondroitin (CH) or heparosan (HPN), to address the major limitation
in their clinical use of GLP-1, which is its short half-life in the
body. After exploring a variety of CHs with different molecular sizes
and heterobifunctional linkers having different alkyl chains, we obtained
CH-conjugated GLP-1 derivatives that stayed in blood circulation much
longer (T1/2 elim > 25 h) than
unconjugated
GLP-1 and showed blood glucose-lowering efficacy up to 120 h after
subcutaneous injection in mice. By using the same optimized linker
design, we eventually obtained a HPN-conjugated GLP-1 derivative with
efficacy lasting 144 h. These results demonstrate that conjugation
with GAG is a promising strategy for improving the duration of peptide
drugs.

==== Body
Introduction
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an
incretin peptide that is
secreted from intestinal L-cells in response to orally ingested nutrients.
It lowers plasma glucose levels by potentiating glucose-dependent
insulin secretion from the endocrine pancreas with very low risk of
hypoglycemia. In addition to its blood glucose-lowering activity,
GLP-1 exerts inhibitory effects on gastric emptying, gastric acid
release, glucagon secretion, and food intake.1−5 Because of these physiological actions, GLP-1 is
a promising therapeutic target for treating noninsulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus (NIDDM) and obesity.

However, GLP-1 is quite unstable
in vivo; its half-life (T1/2 elim) is only 2 min or less when it
is injected intravenously.6 Accordingly,
clinical application of GLP-1 requires frequent administration at
high doses. To overcome this shortcoming, a large number of studies
have attempted to address the causes of its degradation, such as inactivation
by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) or other proteases, rapid disappearance
by renal excretion, and hepatic metabolism.7,8 The
former issue is partially solved by replacement of the DPP IV-vulnerable
residue (Ala8), and the latter is ameliorated by enlarging
and shielding the peptide with inert materials. As of now, scientists
and clinicians have successfully developed NIDDM therapeutics including
an acylated GLP-1 derivative, liraglutide; a lizard-derived GLP-1
analogue, exenatide; and an Fc-fusion GLP-1, dulaglutide.9−11

Modification with polyethylene glycol (PEGylation) has also
been
shown to be beneficial for improving the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
GLP-1 by forming a hydrated cloud that effectively protects GLP-1
from renal clearance and proteolysis.12−15 However, PEGylation has some
issues. First, PEG is not biodegradable, and repeated administration
of PEGylated proteins can induce intracellular vacuolation.16−18 Second, PEGylation of foreign immunogenic moieties such as heterogenic
proteins often causes the production of anti-PEG antiserum, indicating
that PEG is antigenic.19−21 Even in naïve humans who have experienced
no administration of PEGylated drugs, the prevalence of anti-PEG antibodies
has been reported to be up to 25%.22,23

As an
alternative to PEG, biodegradable polysaccharides such as
hydroxyethyl starch and polysialic acid have been conjugated to protein
drugs to extend their blood half-lives.24−28 In addition, we have recently shown that chondroitin
(CH), a type of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of disaccharide repeats
of glucuronic acid (GlcA) and N-acetylgalactosamine
(GalNAc), improves the PK of protein drugs.29 CH-conjugated interferon fully retains its bioactivity, and its
plasma activity lasts 100 h after intravenous (iv) injection.29 CH-conjugated bacterial asparaginase preserves
its enzymatic activity and does not raise anti-CH or antiasparaginase
antibodies after repeated injection.29 CH
is less antigenic because of its abundance in the human body. Notably,
large amounts of CH disaccharide repeats are found in human blood.29

In this study, CH or another GAG, heparosan
(HPN), was conjugated
via N-hydroxysuccinimide–maleimide linkers
(i.e., heterobifunctional linkers) to the C-terminus of the GLP-1
peptide that had been modified with a cysteine residue. The conjugated
peptides were evaluated in comparison with liraglutide for in vitro
agonist activity, plasma circulation after iv and subcutaneous (sc)
injections, and blood glucose-lowering activity in mice. We demonstrate
that the plasma half-lives of conjugated peptides are affected primarily
by the chain length of the heterobifunctional linkers and that optimized
conjugated peptides show robust blood glucose-lowering activity lasting
120–144 h postadministration.

Results and Discussion
Design
of Conjugated GLP-1 Peptide
The active form
of GLP-1 is known as GLP-1(7–37) or GLP-1(7–36) amide,
of which the N-terminal His residue is essential for receptor activation.
Hence, we designed [Gly8, Cys37]GLP-1(7–37) for conjugating the Cys residue of the peptide
with amine-modified CH via heterobifunctional linkers in this study.

To ensure one-to-one and site-specific conjugation, CH was modified
into amine-modified forms by reductive amination of the reducing end’s
sugar. The content of the amino groups ranged between 15 and 80% (mol/mol)
depending on the diamines tested, i.e., ethylenediamine (EDA), hexanediamine
(HDA), 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane (BAMC), and 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)benzene
(BAMB). Among them, those with higher hydrophobicity were less efficient,
and EDA was the best in terms of efficiency and robustness.

Preparation
of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C Peptides
In our
standard small-scale procedure, 40 mg of amine-modified GAG was modified
with different types of heterobifunctional linkers and subsequently
conjugated with [Gly8, Cys37]GLP-1(7–37),
designated as GLP-1C hereafter. The conjugate was purified by reversed-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), as shown in Figure 1A. Separation of
conjugated peptide from unconjugated CH and GLP-1C was quite successful;
conjugated peptide was well-retained in the octadecylsilyl (ODS) column
and was eluted earlier than GLP-1C, whereas CH was never retained
in the column. In contrast, PEGylated GLP-1C was eluted later than
GLP-1C, indicating that PEG is hydrophobic compared to CH.

where X = KMUS (a), HMCS (b), EMCS (c), GMBS (d), or BMPS (e). The
peak top retention time was delayed with increasing carbon number
of the tethering arm.

Analytical HPLC was performed to examine the purity of conjugated
peptides (Figure 1B).
Intriguingly, the retention times of the conjugates were affected
by the heterobifunctional linkers used for connecting GLP-1C and CH
(Figure 1B). The best
overall yield of CH was approximately 20% and that of GLP-1C was around
60%. The low yield of CH was probably due to the limited content of
amine-modified forms in the initial materials and subsequent multistep
reactions.

Disaccharide Analysis of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C
Peptides
The Mn of conjugated
CH was calculated
from the disaccharide analysis of CH-conjugated GLP-1 as follows:
6, 9, 11, 24, 34, 44, and 50 kDa for CH10 (n = 1),
CH20 (n = 1), CH30 (n = 1), CH40
(n = 5), CH70 (n = 23), CH90 (n = 3), and CH140 (n = 21)-conjugated GLP-1C
peptides, respectively. These values were slightly smaller (83% on
average) than those of mother CHs (6 kDa for CH10, 11 kDa for CH20,
19 kDa for CH30, 26 kDa for CH40, 42 kDa for CH70, 49 kDa for CH90,
and 67 kDa for CH140), respectively. This discrepancy is possibly
due to overestimation of peptide concentrations because of the use
of albumin as a control. Otherwise, a lower molecular weight population
of CH might have reacted with better efficiency.

Structural
Analysis of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C Peptides
To verify the structures
of CH-conjugated peptides, they were treated
with chondroitinase-ABC (C-ABC) and then with Glu-C endopeptidase.
The C-ABC-digested products basically provided two major peaks (peaks
2 and 3) and two satellite peaks (peaks 1 and 4) (Figure 2A). Further Glu-C digestion
of peaks 2 and 3 provided several peaks, of which the main peaks (2-C
and 3-C) were found by MS/MS to be the C-terminal peptide (FIAWLVKGRC)
conjugated with sugar moieties, respectively (Figure 2B). Peaks 2-C and 3-C were different in their
sugar structure; the two peaks provided MS signals that matched peptides
conjugated to GalNAc and GlcA, respectively (Figure 3). Additional MS/MS analyses of peaks 1 and
4 indicated that they were incompletely digested products elongated
by a single disaccharide unit of peaks 2 and 3, respectively. These
results indicated that CH preparation was heterogeneous in the sugar
moiety of the reducing end.

2-C and 3-C identified by MS/MS are shown in (A,B), respectively.

GLP-1 Agonist Activity
of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C Peptides
A variety of CH-conjugated
GLP-1C peptides that differed in the heterobifunctional
linkers used for conjugation, their molecular sizes, and their CH
amino modifications were evaluated for their GLP-1 agonist activity
by determining cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production in
RIN-m5F cells. CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptides showed EC50 values ranging from 5 to 20 nM, whereas unmodified GLP-1C peptide
showed an EC50 value of 1 nM. There was no obvious relationship
between the EC50 values and the linker structure of the
conjugates. Liraglutide, an acylated analogue of GLP-1, showed the
most potent agonist activity (EC50 = 0.7 nM). The PEG30k–GLP-1C
peptide showed potent agonist activity (EC50 = 5.2 nM)
compared to CH-conjugated GLP-1C.

Optimization of the Heterobifunctional
Linker
Mice
received iv injections of CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptide at a dose of
1 mg/kg as a GLP-1C peptide (ca. 300 nmol/kg), and the plasma concentration
of conjugates was determined over time by using GLP-1 enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA). All CH-conjugated peptides showed significantly
prolonged half-lives (8.1–38.5 h) compared to that of GLP-1
(Figure 4A). Liraglutide
(1 mg/kg) showed a moderate extent of retention in plasma, but far
less than the CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptide (Figure 4B). The T1/2 elim of liraglutide was unavailable (below the detection limit at 48
h). Notably, CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptides having a long alkyl chain
derived from heterobifunctional linkers of N-[κ-maleimidoundecanoyloxy]-sulfosuccinimide
ester (sulfo-KMUS, C11), N-[λ-maleimidododecanoyloxy]-sulfosuccinimide
ester (sulfo-LMDS, C12), and N-[ν-maleimidotetradecanoyloxy]-sulfosuccinimide
ester (sulfo-NMTS, C14) circulated for a longer period than those
with short linkers (Figure 4A). However, CH-conjugated GLP-1C with long arms over C16
tended to show shortened T1/2 elim, indicating that a linker length of C11–C14 was optimum for
conferring long blood circulation to the conjugate.

All data in (B,C) are shown as means ± SD of triplicate determinations.

The relatively short optimum linker
length suggests that the alkyl
chains of CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptides are unlikely to serve in albumin
binding, which is well-known for modifications with C16 or C18 chains.11,30 Alternatively, we hypothesize that the alkyl chains interact with
the hydrophobic surface of the GLP-1 α-helix to stabilize it.
For exenatide, the C-terminal hydrophobic proline-rich sequence forms
a compact structure (the Trp-cage), which surrounds and shields the
side chain of the Trp25 residue and stabilizes its α-helical
structure.10,31

Optimization of the Molecular
Weight of CH
The molecular
weight of CH also affected the T1/2 elim of CH-conjugated peptides; the beneficial effect was relatively
small (T1/2 elim = 16 h) with CH10
(net bound CH of Mn = 6 kDa), most evident
(T1/2 elim = 22–25 h) with
CH30, CH40, and CH70 (net bound CH of Mn = 11–35 kDa), and gradually decreased with increasing molecular
weight (Figure 4C).
However, there was no significant difference in plasma levels among
these CH-conjugated peptides aside from CH10 (Figure 4B). Even CH10-conjugated peptide showed a
fairly long circulation time compared to the PEG30k-conjugated GLP-1C
peptide (T1/2 elim = 17.5 h).

The result was much better than expected given that 10 kDa PEG-modified
GLP-1 showed very short circulation time (T1/2 elim = 105.5 min),15 and the maximum effect
was attained with tertiary-branched 23 kDa or 50 kDa PEG (39.6 and
51.2 h, respectively).32 Therefore, we
hypothesize that CH is more effective even at low molecular weight
ranges than PEG in preventing renal clearance. The anionic charge
and lower flexibility33 of CH may have
favored the slowing of glomerular filtration.34 The slight decrease of T1/2 elim at high molecular weight ranges may be related to easier capture
of high molecular weight materials by phagocytotic Kupffer cells in
the liver.35,36

PK of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C
Peptide, Conjugate 1
Considering the agonist
activity in vitro and the plasma
circulation (T1/2 elim) after iv
injection at 1 mg/kg, we selected CH70–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C
(conjugate 1) for PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies,
of which the EC50 and T1/2 elim were 6.1 nM and 23.4 h, respectively. LMDS was the best for prolonging
plasma circulation. EDA was the most efficient and stable for amine
modification. CH70 and CH90 were the most convenient materials, requiring
no additional downsizing procedures.

Conjugates were injected
into Crl:CD1 (ICR) mice subcutaneously at 100 nmol/kg (0.33 mg/kg
as GLP-1C peptide), and their plasma levels were determined. This
is the highest dose usually used in rodent models according to the
literature37 and was thus appropriate for
conjugate 1, which had approximately 10 times less potent
agonist activity than liraglutide.

As shown in Figure 5, 1 remained in
circulation much longer (T1/2 elim = 32.9 h) than liraglutide (T1/2 elim = 8.9 h). The Cmax values of 1 and liraglutide were 168.8 and 202.0 ng/mL,
respectively. The Tmax values were 24
and 6 h. The plasma levels of liraglutide increased and decreased
more quickly after sc injection than those of 1. The
AUC0–∞ values were 8629.5 and 4084.3 ng/mL
h. Mean residence times (MRT) were 44.8 and 15.5 h.

GLP-1C peptides. Plasma immunoreactive
GLP-1 levels after sc injection of liraglutide and CH70–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C
(conjugate 1) at 100 nmol/kg, and after sc and iv injections
of CH90–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C (conjugate 2) at 300 nmol/kg as determined over time. All data are shown as means
± SD of triplicate determinations.

PD of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C Peptide, Conjugate 1
For PD studies, 1 and liraglutide were injected
into ICR mice under the same conditions as for the PK studies, except
for feeding conditions. After the administration of peptides, repeated
cycles of intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test (IPGTT) were performed
every 24 h. In each IPGTT, blood glucose was determined at 0 min before
glucose challenge and at 15, 30, and 60 min after glucose challenge.
In the first cycle of IPGTT at 24 h postadministration, the increase
of blood glucose levels was attenuated robustly by pretreatment with
conjugated peptides (Figure 6A); however, this blood glucose-lowering effect was gradually
blunted at 72 h (Figure 6C) and completely lost at 96 h (Figure 6D). On the basis of AUC0–60min, 1 was effective until 72 h (Figure 6E) when its plasma concentration was 35 ng/mL
(Figure 5). This level
is putatively the minimum effective concentration (MEC).

Figure 6 Blood glucose-lowering
activity of CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptides
in mice. IPGTT was performed at 24 (A), 48 (B), 72 (C), and 96 h (D)
after sc injection of vehicle, liraglutide, or CH70–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C
(conjugate 1) to mice at 100 nmol/kg. (E) AUC0–60min of blood glucose for (A–D) is shown. (F) AUC0–60min of IPGTT at indicated times after the sc injection of vehicle, liraglutide,
or CH90–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C (conjugate 2) at 300 nmol/kg. Mean ± SD (n = 6). *: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01, and ***: p < 0.001 vs vehicle (Dunnett’s test).

In contrast, liraglutide showed a very strong blood
glucose-lowering
effect in the first cycle of IPGTT (Figure 6A); it maintained blood glucose at mild hypoglycemic
levels (around 70 mg/dL) even after glucose challenge. However, the
efficacy of liraglutide was not durable and was swiftly lost at 72
h (Figure 6C,D). The
temporal robustness of liraglutide’s effect was likely due
to the high agonist activity (EC50 = 0.7 nM) and steep
increase of its plasma concentration.

PK and PD of CH-Conjugated
GLP-1C Peptide, Conjugate 2
Next, PK studies
were performed with CH90–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C
(conjugate 2) at 300 nmol/kg (1 mg/kg as GLP-1C peptide),
of which the chemical structure is the same as that of 1 except a small difference in the molecular weight of CH. Therefore,
we assumed that 2 would be almost the same one as 1. Indeed, the biological profile (EC50 = 9.9 nM, T1/2 elim = 25.3 h after iv injection) of 2 was very similar to that of 1. PK parameters
were obtained from sc and iv injections (Figure 5) administered in parallel, and the bioavailability
was obtained as 21% (Table 1). Dose escalation from 100 to 300 nmol/kg increased the plasma
immunoreactive GLP-1 levels five times and delayed the levels reaching
the putative MEC (35 ng/mL) by 3 days. Mice tolerated it well, and
no remarkable adverse events were observed with any iv or sc injections,
although the total mass of the conjugate became as high as 10–15
mg/kg at a dose of 300 nmol/kg.

IPGTT
was performed at 96, 120, 144, and 168 h after dosing of 2 or liraglutide at 300 nmol/kg. The conjugated peptide 2 successfully displayed prolonged blood glucose-lowering
efficacy until 120 h (Figure 6F); however, that was 1 day shorter than that expected from
the plasma levels. The plasma levels of 2 at a dose of
300 nmol/kg were 60 ng/mL at 120 h and 40 ng/mL at 144 h (Figure 5), which were still
higher than the putative MEC obtained from dosing at 100 nmol/kg.
Therefore, we deduced that the MEC of 1 or 2 ranged between 35 and 60 ng/mL.

PK and PD of HPN-Conjugated
GLP-1C Peptide, Conjugate 3
DeAngelis proposed
that HPN is a promising conjugating
polymer to extend the plasma residence of injectable therapeutics38 and has demonstrated that 99 kDa HPN-conjugated
G-CSF is very stable as shown by its T1/2 elim of 8 days in a nonhuman primate.39

Because the linker design of 1 and 2 proved
beneficial for improving the plasma circulation of CH-conjugated GLP-1C
peptides, although we still wanted a more stable linker, we applied
it to HPN50 (Mw/Mn = 51 kDa/32 kDa) to generate HPN50–EDA–(LMDS)–GLP-1C
(conjugate 3). Also, HPN50–EDA–(N-[β-Maleimidopropyloxy]succinimide ester (BMPS))–GLP-1C
(conjugate 4) with a short linker was prepared for comparison.
After verifying their agonist activity in vitro (EC50 =
7.0 nM for 3 and 9.0 nM for 4), these HPN-conjugated
GLP-1C peptides were subjected to PK and PD studies by dosing at 300
nmol/kg.

Conjugate 3 with a long alkyl linker circulated
more
sustainably (T1/2 elim = 33.6 h after
iv injection) than 4 with a short linker (T1/2 elim = 23.8 h) (Figure 7A), demonstrating that across different GAG
species, the half-lives of GAG-conjugated GLP-1C peptides are affected
by the length of the alkyl chain derived from the heterobifunctional
linker. Furthermore, substitution of HPN for CH favorably affected
the plasma circulation; HPN-conjugated GLP-1C showed better T1/2 elim than that of CH-conjugated GLP-1C.
Even HPN conjugate 4 with a short linker showed a T1/2 elim over 20 h.

*: p < 0.05, **: p < 0.01,
and ***: p < 0.001 vs vehicle (Dunnett’s
test).

PK parameters from iv and sc injections
of 3 are summarized
in Table 1. Generally, 3 displayed better profiles than 2. Because improvement
of AUC by exchanging GAGs from CH to HPN was more prominent in iv
injection than in sc injection, the bioavailability of 3 was decreased to 12%. The plasma concentration of 3 at 144 h after sc injection attained 62.9 ng/mL (Figure 7B), which was above the MEC
of CH-conjugated GLP-1 (35–60 ng/mL). This indicated that the
HPN-conjugated GLP-1C peptide, conjugate 3, is more durable
than the CH-conjugated GLP-1C peptide, conjugate 2.

Finally, HPN-conjugated peptide 3 was tested for its
blood glucose-lowering activity at 300 nmol/kg administration. The
conjugated peptide lowered glucose levels at 120 h after administration
and still exerted activity at 144 h (Figure 7C). This is a favorable result in that conjugate 3 is approaching one-week duration, suggesting a need to compare
it further with a weekly formulation, semaglutide.11

GAG conjugation has been shown to be successful in
prolonging the
circulation of medicinal peptides. The underlying mechanisms probably
involve delayed renal clearance of conjugated GAG.38 We have recently found that CH is long-lasting by itself
in mice, whereas chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronan disappear very
shortly.40 Also, isolation from the reticuloendothelial
system and plasma proteases (i.e., molecular shielding) is another
possible mechanism not specifically addressed in this study. Nevertheless,
the circulating GLP-1 immunoreactivity probably reflected uncleaved
peptides because of the specificity of the enzyme immunoassay and
the prolonged duration of efficacy. This suggests that GAG modification
adequately protected GLP-1C molecules. Molecular shielding can also
cause steric hindrance to receptor interactions. In this aspect, the
agonist activity of GAG-conjugated GLP-1C peptides was roughly in
the same range as that of PEGylated GLP-1.

It has yet to be
revealed which mechanisms make particular kinds
of GAG long-lasting in mouse circulation and how the underlying mechanisms
are conserved through the species. Regarding safety, we preliminarily
found that CH circulates in humans and that consecutive iv injections
of CH in rats at 100 mg/kg for 28 days did not cause any adverse events
or histological changes such as vacuolation, suggesting that CH is
an inert material.29,40 The safety of CH and HPN is a
critical subject to be carefully investigated in the future. In conclusion,
our results suggest the use of GAG modification as an option to improve
the performance of medicinal peptides.

Experimental Procedures
Cross-linkers
N-[α-Maleimidoacetoxy]succinimide
ester (AMAS) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham,
MA), and EDA was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka,
Japan). BMPS, HDA, BAMC (cis- and trans-mixture), and BAMB were from
Tokyo Chemical Industry (Tokyo, Japan). N-[γ-Maleimidobutyryloxy]sulfosuccinimide
ester (sulfo-GMBS), N-[ε-maleimidocaproyloxy]sulfosuccinimide
ester (sulfo-EMCS), N-(η-maleimidocapryloxy)sulfosuccinimide
(sulfo-HMCS), and sulfo-KMUS were from Dojindo Laboratories (Kumamoto,
Japan). sulfo-LMDS, sulfo-NMTS, and N-[o-maleimidohexadecanoyloxy]-sulfosuccinimide
ester (sulfo-OMHS) were synthesized in our laboratory.

Peptides
GLP-1C (HGEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGRC) was
purchased from Scrum Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). Liraglutide (Victoza) was
obtained from Novo Nordisk A/S (Bagsværd, Denmark).

Glycosaminoglycans
CH was produced by elongation from
glycolipid initiators via the capsular polysaccharide biosynthetic
pathway in gene-engineered Escherichia coli (MSC702 strain).41 For the preparation
of CH70, CH90, and CH140, mild alkaline treatment was exploited both
for removing the glycolipid moiety and decreasing the molecular size
by sequential degradation of the polysaccharide chains. Additional
acid treatment was used to further downsize CH70 (or CH90) into CH10,
CH20, CH30, and CH40.42 Purification was
principally done by alcohol precipitation. Treatment with acetic anhydride
was done to secure the GalNAc structure. It was inevitable that a
relatively high degree of polydispersity was found for the molecular
weight of CH as follows: CH10 (Mw/Mn = 10 kDa/6 kDa), CH20 (21 kDa/11 kDa), CH30
(31 kDa/19 kDa), CH40 (43 kDa/26 kDa), CH70 (69 kDa/42 kDa), CH90
(92 kDa/49 kDa), and CH140 (141 kDa/67 kDa). Polydispersity (Mw/Mn) was around
1.6–2.1. HPN50 (Mw/Mn = 51 kDa/32 kDa) was purified from the fermentation
broth of the K5 strain of E. coli in
the same manner as CH.

Reductive Amination of GAGs
GAGs
(CH and HPN) were
modified to amine forms by the reductive amination of aldehyde groups
with diamine (aliphatic or aromatic) using an excess amount of the
reducing agent sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) or 2-picoline borane (Tokyo Chemical Industry). After the reaction,
GAGs were purified by repeated cycles of ethanol precipitation followed
by gel filtration in 0.1 M ammonium formate buffer through two tandem-connected
26/10 desalting columns (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) equipped with
AKTA avant 25 (GE Healthcare) followed by exhaustive dialysis against
distilled water (DW). The purified GAGs were lyophilized, and the
content of amino groups was determined by colorimetric quantification
with o-phthalaldehyde.43

Preparation of GAG-Conjugated GLP-1C Peptides
Amine-modified
GAGs (20 mg) were dissolved in 50% dimethylformamide (DMF) at 40 mg/mL,
mixed with 10 mM heterobifunctional linkers (120 μL) and 0.5
M bicine-HCl buffer (pH 8.3, 60 μL), and reacted for 1 h at
room temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture was diluted to
3.2 mL with 0.1 M ammonium formate buffer, and aliquots (1.6 mL) were
subjected to gel-filtration chromatography on seven tandem-connected
HiTrap Desalting columns (GE Healthcare) in 0.1 M ammonium formate
buffer at a flow rate of 3 mL/min.

The purified GAG fraction
was lyophilized, dissolved in DW (650 μL), and mixed with 10
mg/mL GLP-1C/DMF (80 μL), acetonitrile (325 μL), and 0.5
M HEPES buffer (pH 7.0, 80 μL), and reacted for 16 h at room
temperature in the dark. The reaction mixture was diluted with 0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/DW (6 mL), centrifuged at 20 600g for 10 min, and injected into a reversed-phase HPLC column
(DAISO, SP-120-5-ODS-BP, 20 mm × 250 mm) equipped with a Waters
600 series pump (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) at a flow rate of 8 mL/min
at 40 °C. Then, the GAG-conjugated peptide was eluted by a linear
gradient increase of acetonitrile concentration from 8 to 48% for
30 min. PEGylated GLP-1C was also prepared by reacting GLP-1C with
PEG30k–maleimide (SUNBRIGHT ME-300MA, NOF, Tokyo, Japan). Purification
was performed by reversed-phase HPLC.

The purified conjugated
peptide was lyophilized, weighed, dissolved
in DW at a concentration of 4 mg powder/mL, and subjected to bicinchoninic
acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The calibration curve
was generated by using bovine serum albumin standard (Thermo Fisher
Scientific), although it overestimated peptide concentration up to
1.5-fold compared to that made with a GLP-1 standard (Peptide Institute,
Osaka, Japan). The weights of conjugated peptide and liraglutide are
shown by GLP-1 peptide-equivalent weights and not by the whole weight
of conjugated peptide or liraglutide.

Quantification of CH
Disaccharide analysis was performed
for CH-conjugated peptides to quantify the content of CH. Briefly,
the conjugated peptide was digested with 0.125 U/12.5 μL C-ABC
(Seikagaku Corp.) and 0.0125 U/12.5 μL Chondroitinase ACII (ACII,
Seikagaku Corp.) at 37 °C for 2 h and then subjected to HPLC
analysis with monitoring by postcolumn labeling as described previously.44 The number of total disaccharide units and the
whole molecular mass of CH were calculated per peptide molecule.

Structural Analysis of CH-Conjugated GLP-1C Peptides
CH-conjugated
GLP-1 peptides were dissolved in DW (100 μL)
at 0.3–0.5 mg/mL, mixed with 0.4 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 50 μL),
0.4 M sodium acetate (50 μL), DW (400 μL), and 10 U/mL
C-ABC (50 μL), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Digested
peptide was boiled, diluted with 0.1% TFA, injected into a reversed-phase
HPLC column (DAISO SP120-5-ODS-BP, 4.6 × 150 mm), and eluted
by a linear gradient increase of acetonitrile concentration from 28
to 48% over 30 min at a flow rate of 0.83 mL/min. The peak fractions
were obtained and lyophilized. Next, the lyophilized peptide was dissolved
in 0.1 M acetate ammonium (50 μL) and digested with Glu-C endopeptidase
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1.9 μL) at 37 °C overnight.
The digested peptide was injected into a reversed-phase HPLC column
(DAISO SP120-5-ODS-BP, 4.6 × 150 mm) and eluted by a linear gradient
increase of acetonitrile concentration from 0 to 100% over 30 min
at a flow rate of 0.83 mL/min. The peak fractions were analyzed by
amaZon speed ETD (Bruker, Billerica, MA).

Assay of GLP-1 Agonist
Activities
RIN-m5F cells (ATCC,
Manassas, VA) were cultured at a seeding density of 40 000
cells/well in 10% fetal calf serum/RPMI 1640 medium (both from Thermo
Fisher Scientific) in BIOCOAT poly-d-lysine-coated, white-wall
96-well plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for 16 h at
37 °C under 5% CO2. The cells were starved in a serum-free
RPMI 1640 medium for 6 h, treated with 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mM Ro-20-1724 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min,
and then challenged with varying concentrations of GLP-1C or CH-conjugated
GLP-1C peptides for 10 min. Then, cAMP levels were determined in situ
using a cAMP-Glo Max Assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI). Luminescence
intensity was measured with an ARVO ×5 plate reader (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA).

Animals
Male ICR mice were obtained
from Charles River
Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) at 5 weeks old and acclimatized for
5–10 days in the specific pathogen-free animal facility under
a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, and controlled temperature (20–26
°C), and humidity (30–70%). All mice were given free access
to chow diet (except during glucose-tolerance tests) and water. All
procedures for animal care and animal experiments were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Seikagaku
Corporation.

PK Studies
Male ICR mice (6 weeks
old, n = 3) received iv injections of GAG-conjugated
GLP-1C at 1 mg/kg,
as GLP-1C peptide or liraglutide at 1 mg/kg, in a screening study.
To compare PK and PD, the mice received iv injections of GAG-conjugated
GLP-1C at 300 nmol/kg, sc injections of GAG-conjugated GLP-1C at 100
or 300 nmol/kg, or sc injection of liraglutide at 100 nmol/kg. Blood
samples were collected from the tail vein at 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96,
120, and 144 h postadministration. Plasma samples were prepared from
the blood samples and stored at −80 °C until use. The
concentration of immunoreactive GLP-1 in the plasma samples was quantified
using a glucagon-like peptide-1 (active) ELISA kit (Millipore, Darmstadt,
Germany). The fluorescence intensity was measured with a microplate
reader (ARVO ×5, PerkinElmer). The standard curve was generated
by fitting the four parameters to a logistic regression using Origin
ver. 9.1 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). Plasma half-life time
was calculated using Phoenix WinNonlin Version 6.4 (Pharsight Corp.,
St. Louis, MO), and mean values of three measurements were obtained.

IPGTT for PD
Male ICR mice (6 weeks old, n = 6) received sc injections of GAG-conjugated GLP-1C or liraglutide
at 100 and 300 nmol/kg or with saline for control. At 24, 48, 72,
and 96 h after dosing at 100 nmol/kg or at 96, 120, 144, and 168 h
after dosing at 300 nmol/kg, the mice were challenged with intraperitoneal
injection of glucose at 1 g/kg preceded by food deprivation for 6
h and blood glucose levels were measured at 0 min before glucose challenge
and 15, 30, and 60 min after glucose challenge under food-deprived
conditions. Mice were re-fed and rested for the next IPGTT. A self-monitoring
blood glucose meter (Eisai, Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure glucose
levels in blood samples (5 μL). The blood glucose levels were
plotted over time, and the AUC0–60min was obtained.
Statistical analysis was by Dunnett’s test.
