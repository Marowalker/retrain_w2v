In this work, we have investigated
the effects of denaturing agents,
guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) and temperature, on the overall structure,
domain-I, and domain-III of human serum albumin (HSA) using circular
dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and steady-state, time-resolved fluorescence
spectroscopy. We have tagged Cys-34 of HSA, located at domain-I, using N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)iodoacetamide and
Tyr-411 of HSA, located at domain-III, using p-nitrophenyl
coumarin ester, for this purpose. The CD spectroscopy studies reveal
the overall denaturation of the protein. The denaturation follows
the expected direction in which the protein is denatured with an increase
in the concentration of GnHCl or temperature. The α-helicity
of the native state of HSA was found to be 64.2%, and the minimum
value of α-helicity was found to be 14.8% in the presence of
6 M GnHCl at room temperature. Steady-state emission studies were
carried out on domain-I and domain-III of the protein using site-specific
fluorescent tags. The degree of folding of the two domains at different
combinations of temperature and GnHCl concentration was calculated
and was found to follow a slightly different course of denaturation.
Solvation dynamics was found to be quite different for these two domains.
The domain-I of HSA has a maximum solvation time of 0.39 ns, and the
solvation time tends to decrease with the action of either temperature
or GnHCl. On the other hand, the domain-III of HSA showed a much higher
solvation time (1.42 ns) and does not show any regular change at higher
temperatures or in the presence of GnHCl. This difference could be
attributed to the different microenvironment inside the protein cores
of the two domains.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Human serum albumin (HSA)
is the most abundant transport protein
present in human blood serum.1−3 Being a huge protein with 585
amino acid residues and 66.5 kDa molecular weight, it has a few hydrophobic
pockets which can accommodate macromolecules and transport them to
specific locations of the human body.4−10 HSA is responsible for the transport of a variety of molecules including
carbohydrates, fatty acids, drugs, hormones, etc.4,9,10 Structurally, HSA is divided into three
domains, each of which consists of two subdomains.3−5 It is to be
noted that all proteins, including HSA, perform their biological actions
in physiological conditions having a specific structure, known as
the native state of the protein. In the native state, the protein
chain is folded in a unique way to minimize the destabilizing interaction.
Any loss in this folded three-dimensional (3D) structure under the
effect of any external factor is broadly identified as denaturation
of the protein and it eventually leads to the loss in its function.11−18 Understanding the complex mechanism of denaturation has remained
a topic of research for several decades.14,19 Besides this, biological and biochemical research has been carried
out to monitor the functionality of proteins as a function of external
parameters and to relate it with the structural perturbation.20,21

Fluorescence techniques are being vastly applied to study
proteins,
owing to their sensitivity toward the local environment inside the
protein.22−38 Tyrosine and tryptophan are the two main fluorescing amino acid
residues, which cause intrinsic fluorescence of proteins. In most
proteins, the number of these amino acid residues is more than one,
and they are located at different parts of the protein. For this reason,
site-specific information is lost, and the signal depicts the overall
picture. Fortunately, HSA has a single tryptophan residue located
at the 214th position in domain-II, which serves as an efficient marker
for monitoring this domain.36,37 However, domain-I and
domain-III do not have any site-specific intrinsic fluorophore, and
hence, fluorescent labeling is necessary to perform domain-I- and
domain-III-specific unfolding studies. Several reports are available
on the tagging of HSA with noncovalent and covalent fluorescent markers.32,33,38−40 The covalent
markers are always more trusted than the noncovalent ones on account
of their much stronger attachment with the protein. Domain-I of HSA
has a single free cysteine residue at the 34th position, which can
be tagged with thiol-specific fluorescence probes.32,33,38,39 In our earlier
reports, we have labeled domain-I with tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide
and N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarin-3-yl)iodoacetamide
(DACIA).38 Domain-III, on the other hand,
has a tyrosine residue at the 411th position, which is much more active
than the other tyrosine residues and can be selectively labeled by
hydroxyl-specific fluorescent probes.41 However, no suitable fluorescent marker is available commercially
to tag the tyrosine residue. In one of our recent reports, we have
designed and synthesized a fluorescent marker p-nitrophenyl
coumarin ester (NPCE), which successfully tags Tyr-411 and delivers
useful domain-specific information.39

There are several reports on the effect of external parameters
on the structure and dynamics of proteins, but there are only a few
reports on the effect of more than one denaturant simultaneously.42 Such a situation of multiple denaturing effects
is important as similar situations may be occurring in biological
systems. Moreover, the effect of such multiple denaturation may not
be uniform throughout the protein structure, and thus, a domain-specific
study is warranted. Similar studies on the effect of more than one
denaturant were carried out by Shaw and Pal, where they observed that
the donor–acceptor distance of the alkali-induced conformer
of HSA does not change with temperature, whereas in the case of acid-induced
and native conformer, the distance was found to decrease with an increase
in temperature. The donor and acceptor in this case were Trp-214 and
a photosensitizing drug, protoporphyrin IX, respectively.43 In another study carried out by Ahmad et al.,
domain-specific ligands have been used to study the unfolding of different
domains of HSA under the action of guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl),
and they reveal that in the presence of GnHCl, domain-III is more
liable to unfolding compared to the two other domains.44

In the present study, we aimed to map
the unfolding behavior of
domain-I and domain-III of HSA under a double denaturing condition
with GnHCl (0–6 M) and temperature (283–353 K). We have
used steady-state as well as time-resolved fluorescence measurements
to understand the nature of unfolding.

2 Results
2.1 Effect of Double Denaturation on the Overall
Structure of HSA
The overall structural features of unfolding
of HSA were monitored by measuring the α-helicity content by
circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy using the following equation:45 1  where the mean molar residual ellipticity
at 222 nm (MRE222) is defined as 2  

In the above equation, θ222 is the intensity of CD signal at 222 nm, M is the molecular weight of HSA, n is the number
of amino acid residues, c is the concentration in
g/L, and l is the path length of the cuvette. The
helicity of the native state of HSA has been calculated as 64.2%,
which is in good agreement with the reported value.38,39

Upon denaturation, the α-helicity has been found to
decrease
both with an increase in temperature and with an increase in GnHCl
concentration. At high concentrations of GnHCl, CD spectra could not
be recorded below 210 nm because of significant interference from
GnHCl. Figure 1 shows
the CD spectra of HSA at four different GnHCl–temperature combinations.
The α-helicity for all the samples was calculated using the
same set of equations as discussed. In the absence of GnHCl, the α-helicity
decreases to 38.0% at the highest temperature (353 K), whereas at
room temperature, the α-helicity was 14.8% at 6 M GnHCl. This
value of α-helicity is the minimum value within our experimental
range, and it can be ascribed to the most unfolded state of HSA in
our experiments. To quantify the extent of unfolding, we have written
the following equation using the α-helicity content of HSA. 3  where fi is a
measure of the degree of folding (varies between 1 and 0), αi is the α-helicity at a particular denaturing condition
(i.e., either at some specific temperature or at some specific GnHCl
concentration or both together), and αU and αN are the α-helicities of HSA in its unfolded (i.e.,
in the presence of 6 M GnHCl at 298 K) and native (i.e., in the absence
of GnHCl at 298 K) states, respectively. Figure 2 shows the contour diagram of the calculated
extent of folding as a function of GnHCl concentrations and temperatures.
From the contour diagram, it is evident that the effect of temperature
is less pronounced than the effect of GnHCl.

HSA at four different combinations of GnHCl
concentration and temperature. The concentration of HSA in each case
is 1.85 μM, and the path length in each case is 2 mm.

data points.

2.2 Effect
of Double Denaturation on Domain-I
of HSA
2.2.1 Steady-State Measurement
As mentioned
earlier, the domain-I of HSA was tagged with DACIA to study the unfolding
behavior of domain-I in the presence of GnHCl and temperature. However,
first, we have to be sure that the tagging of DACIA does not alter
the secondary structure of HSA, which was verified by measuring the
CD spectra. The same study was also performed with NPCE-tagged HSA
(note: NPCE binds to the domain-III of HSA). Figure 3 shows the CD spectra of the native HSA,
HSA tagged with DACIA, and HSA tagged with NPCE. The calculated values
of α-helicity and the spectral signatures are similar for all
the three cases, indicating that the attachment of the fluorescent
label (either DACIA or NPCE) does not affect the secondary structure
of HSA. Further, to investigate the effect of tagging on the tertiary
structure of HSA, we have recorded the near-UV CD spectra (250–320
nm) using a higher HSA concentration (15 μM) and a longer path
length (10 mm). The resulting spectra of tagged and untagged HSA possess
similar features, indicating that the tertiary structure is also retained
upon tagging with either DACIA or NPCE.

Figure 3 CD spectra of untagged
HSA (red), HSA tagged with DACIA (green),
and HSA tagged with NPCE (blue). The concentrations of untagged HSA,
DACIA-tagged HSA, and NPCE-tagged HSA are 1.85, 1.7, and 1.65 μM,
respectively. The path length in each case is 2 mm.

The fluorescent tag DACIA, which has been used
to tag domain-I,
is a solvatochromic probe, which shows strong solvent polarity dependence
on emission spectra.38 Upon being tagged
to domain-I of HSA, DACIA shows a 20 nm blue shift (λemmax = 457 nm) in
emission maximum from 477 nm in buffer, owing to the more hydrophobic
environment inside the protein core. As HSA unfolds, the emission
maximum shows a bathochromic shift as shown in Figure 4 for four different GnHCl–temperature
combinations. In order to verify if the tags undergo any structural
changes at elevated temperatures, we have recorded the excitation
spectra of DACIA and NPCE at higher temperatures and observed that
the spectrum at 348 K is almost overlapping with that at 298 K. This
confirms that both these dyes are stable within our experimental range
of temperature. The amount of shift normalized by the maximum amount
of shift has been used to denote the degree of folding as per the
following equation. 4  where λN and λU are the emission maxima in the native and
unfolded states,
respectively, and λi is the emission maxima for the
intermediate temperatures and GnHCl concentrations. The value of λi at 298 K in the absence of GnHCl has been taken as λN, and the value of λi at 298 K in the presence
of 6 M GnHCl has been taken as λU. The contour plot
(Figure 5) shows the
variation of the degree of folding at different GnHCl concentrations
and temperatures. Expectedly, as per the definition, the extent of
folding is unity at 298 K in the absence of GnHCl. Upon increasing
the temperature and GnHCl concentration, the extent of folding decreases.
As evident, the effect of temperature is similar at all GnHCl concentrations,
and the denaturation effect of GnHCl is much more pronounced as compared
to that of the temperature. Apart from this regular observation, we
observe two striking features. The first one is that at 323 K, the
extent of folding is more than unity. Second, at 283 K, in the absence
of GnHCl, the extent of folding is less than unity.

combinations of GnHCl concentration and temperature.

emission
maxima of DACIA tagged to domain-I of HSA at different temperatures
and in the presence of different concentrations of GnHCl. The black
dots on the contour graph represent the measured data points.

2.2.2 Lifetime
Measurement
To gather
further information on the nature of heat and GnHCl-induced denaturation,
the fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed for a few samples.
The excited-state lifetime of the free DACIA molecule was measured
at its emission maximum, and the fluorescent transients were fitted
using a triexponential function. The decay components were found to
be 0.28 ns (3%), 1.85 ns (85%), and 3.31 ns (12%) with an average
lifetime of 1.98 ns. Once tagged to domain-I of HSA, the average lifetime
was found to increase to 3.64 ns with three decay components 0.37
ns (3%), 1.81 ns (22%), and 4.28 ns (76%).

The lifetime measurements
of DACIA-tagged HSA were carried out in the absence of GnHCl and in
the presence of 2 and 5 M GnHCl at three different temperatures: 298,
328, and 348 K at their respective emission maxima. In all cases,
the fluorescence transients were fitted using triexponential functions.
In the presence of 2 M GnHCl at 298 K, the average lifetime was found
to decrease to 3.29 ns, whereas in the absence of GnHCl at 328 K,
the average lifetime became 3.41 ns. The emission maxima and the average
lifetime of each of the cases are given in Table 1. It can be seen that the lifetime of DACIA
tagged to HSA decreases with an increase in the concentration of GnHCl
and with an increase in temperature, which indicate an increase in
the nonradiative rate constant of the excited DACIA molecule at higher
temperatures and higher GnHCl concentration. However, this study is
not much informative, and we proceed with solvation dynamics study
to have a better picture of the dynamics of associated water molecules
within the domain.

2.2.3 Solvation Dynamics Measurement
We have studied the
dynamics of solvation within the domain-I of
HSA using the solvatochromic property of DACIA. For this purpose,
the fluorescence transients at 20 different wavelengths spread over
the steady-state emission spectrum (from 405 to 550 nm) were recorded
at the magic angle condition. The fluorescence transients collected
at longer wavelengths showed a distinct growth component, which was
absent at shorter wavelengths. All transients were fitted using a
triexponential function. At 298 K and in the absence of GnHCl, the
average lifetime at 405 nm was found to be 1.44 ns with the three
lifetime components 0.13 ns (41%), 1.04 ns (30%), and 3.70 ns (29%).
At 550 nm, the average lifetime was calculated to be 4.08 ns with
components 0.37 ns (−17%), 1.26 ns (43%), and 4.86 ns (74%).
Some of the transients are shown in Figure 6. The time-resolved emission spectra (TRES)
were constructed from the decay components following a standard procedure,
which is shown along with the steady-state spectrum in Figure 7.46

Figure 6 Fluorescence
transients of DACIA tagged to domain-I of HSA in phosphate
buffer solution of pH 7.4 at wavelengths 405, 440, and 550 nm upon
exciting at 375 nm. Transients in a short time window are shown in
the inset.

Figure 7 TRES of DACIA tagged to domain-I of HSA in phosphate
buffer solution
of pH 7.4. The steady-state emission spectrum is also shown for comparison.

While constructing the solvent
response function from TRES, we
observed that the convergence of data was not very good, which may
be arising due to the complex environment and constant fluctuations
of the protein core.47 In such cases, choosing
an appropriate ν(∞) value (eq 2) could be challenging, and any change in
the chosen ν(∞) value usually changes the value of the
solvation time drastically. For our experiments, the time spectrum
whose peak frequency closely matches to that of the steady-state spectrum
has been chosen as the ν(∞), which is the spectrum at
2 ns for the present case. The solvent response function, thus calculated,
is shown in Figure 8, which is best fitted using a biexponential function, and the two
components were found to be 0.15 ns (55%) and 0.68 ns (45%) with an
average solvation time of 0.39 ns. The Stokes shift was observed to
be 480 cm–1. For the purpose of comparing our data
with a previously reported data32 of the
same system where the ν(∞) value was chosen at 10 ns,
we also performed the same line of analysis choosing ν(∞)
value at 10 ns. The solvent correlation function thus obtained gave
an average solvation time of 2.56 ns, which is very close to the value
reported in the literature (2.50 ns).32

Figure 8 Decay
of solvent response function of DACIA tagged to domain-I
of HSA in phosphate buffer of pH 7.4.

In a similar fashion, the solvation dynamics of domain-I
of HSA
has been studied for nine different combinations of temperatures and
GnHCl concentrations. At 328 K, in the absence of GnHCl, the lifetime
components at 405 nm were found to be 0.14 ns (43%), 1.00 ns (33%),
and 3.60 ns (24%) with an average lifetime of 1.25 ns. At 550 nm,
the three components are 0.29 ns (−13%), 1.45 ns (68%), and
4.90 ns (45%) with an average lifetime of 3.15 ns. TRES were constructed
from the decay components, and a dynamic Stokes shift of 430 cm–1 was observed. The two components obtained from the
fitting of solvent response function using a biexponential function
were found to be 0.25 ns (96%) and 1.29 ns (4%) with an average solvation
time of 0.29 ns. The components of solvent response functions and
the observed dynamic Stokes shifts of DACIA tagged to domain-I of
HSA at different temperatures and at different concentrations of GnHCl
are compiled in Table 2, and the solvent correlation functions along with their fittings
are shown in Figure 9.

of HSA in the presence of 0, 2, and 5 M GnHCl (a) at 298, (b) at 328,
and (c) at 348 K, respectively.

5	348	0.09 (0.13)	0.28
(0.87)	0.26	110	94	0.09	
From Table 2, it
can be seen that either an increasing temperature or a high concentration
of GnHCl results in a decrease in solvation time. However, the effect
of temperature in the presence of GnHCl (2 or 5 M) is quite strange.
In these two cases, we observed that the solvation time is unaffected
by raising the temperature from 298 to 328 K; however, further increase
in the temperature to 348 K leads to slower solvation. Another important
observation is that at 348 K, the solvation time hardly depends on
the GnHCl concentration. The dynamic Stokes shift was found to decrease
with an increase in temperature or with an increase in the concentration
of GnHCl in each of the cases we monitored. Certainly, a significant
portion of the total Stokes shift has not been observed in our study
unlike the slowest part of the solvation dynamics. The missing components
of dynamic Stokes shift in our picosecond setup were calculated using
the method demonstrated by Fee and Maroncelli.48 The emission frequency at time zero, νemp(0), was calculated
using the equation 5  where νabsp is the absorption frequency in a polar
medium and νabsnp and νemnp denote the steady-state absorption and emission frequencies
of DACIA in a nonpolar medium (in our case, cyclohexane). The missing
components of Stokes shift for DACIA-tagged HAS under different denaturating
conditions are listed in Table 2.

2.3 Effect of Double Denaturation
on Domain-III
of HSA
2.3.1 Steady-State Measurement
The fluorescent
label NPCE, which is used to tag domain-III of HSA, shows the emission
maximum at 493 nm in buffer. After being covalently attached to HSA,
the emission maximum shifts to 478 nm. The solvatochromic behavior
of NPCE is utilized to study the double denaturation effect of this
specific domain. The fluorescence maximum of NPCE-tagged HSA gets
red-shifted monotonously with an increase in temperature almost at
all GnHCl concentrations. Figure 10 shows the emission spectra of NPCE-tagged HSA at two
different GnHCl concentrations and at two different temperatures.
Using eq 6, the change
in degree of folding of this domain has been calculated from the shifts
in the emission maxima of NPCE. Here also, the same nomenclature of
λN and λU has been used. The variation
of extent of folding upon thermal and chemical denaturation is shown
in the contour plot in Figure 11.

Figure 10 Emission spectra of NPCE in NPCE-tagged HSA at four different
combinations
of GnHCl concentrations and temperatures.

Figure 11 Degree of folding of domain-III of HSA calculated from the emission
maxima of NPCE tagged to domain-III of HSA at different temperatures
and in the presence of different concentrations of GnHCl. The black
dots on the contour graph represent the measured data points.

2.3.2 Lifetime
Measurement
The excited-state
lifetime of NPCE in phosphate buffer was measured at its emission
maximum, the transients were best fitted using a single exponential
function, and the lifetime was found to be 4.1 ns. After tagging to
domain-III of HSA, the fluorescence transient becomes triexponential
with an average lifetime of 3.7 ns. Similar to the experiments carried
out with DACIA-tagged domain-I of HSA, the lifetime of NPCE-tagged
HSA was also measured in the presence of denaturing agents—GnHCl
and temperature, and in all cases, the fluorescence transients were
fitted with a triexponential function. In the presence of 2 M GnHCl
at 298 K, the average lifetime reduced to 3.05 ns. In the absence
of GnHCl at 328 K, a decrease in the lifetime was also observed. The
average lifetimes of NPCE tagged to domain-III of HSA in the presence
of different concentrations of GnHCl at various temperatures are given
in Table 3. It could
be seen that there is only a small variation in the lifetime of NPCE
tagged to domain-III of HSA with an increase in temperature and with
an increase in GnHCl concentration.

2.3.3 Solvation Dynamics Measurement
Solvation dynamics within
the domain-III of HSA was measured using
the tagged NPCE. The fluorescence transients at different wavelengths
along the steady-state emission spectrum of the molecule were measured,
and using the wavelength-dependent lifetime data, TRES were constructed.
Following this, the solvent correlation function has been constructed
as described in section 2.2.3. The observed solvation time, dynamic Stokes shift,
and the missing components of Stokes shift within the domain-III of
HSA for nine different combinations of GnHCl and temperatures are
tabulated in Table 4, which are also depicted in Figure 12.

is found to be 0.76 ns with its components 0.05 ns (23%) and 0.97
ns (77%). The observed Stokes shift in this case is 225 cm–1. Surprisingly, for domain-III, unlike domain-I, we have not observed
a definite trend in solvation time either on changing the temperature
or on changing the GnHCl concentration.

3 Discussion
It is well-known that definite interactions between
amino acid
residues guide a protein to fold into its characteristic native 3D
structure that determines its functional specificity.49−51 The secondary structures of proteins are stabilized by hydrogen
bonding, whereas other noncovalent interactions such as electrostatic
interactions and hydrophobicity are responsible for the formation
of the tertiary structure of the proteins.49−51 Under the action
of denaturants, these interactions are broken. Understanding the complex
mechanism of denaturation has remained a topic of considerable research
for several decades. Temperature-, pH-, and chemical-induced denaturation
pathways of various proteins have been extensively studied by several
groups.12−19,52,53 In the case of GnHCl, this unfolding is driven by the attractive
interaction of the protein surface with the GnHCl molecule. When this
interaction overcomes the hydrogen bonding network of the protein,
which is responsible for the stabilization of the native state, the
protein gets denatured.54 To understand
the thermal unfolding of the protein in aqueous solution, a proper
understanding of the role of water molecules is necessary. Inside
an aqueous solution, the hydrophobic protein molecules tend to disrupt
the intermolecular hydrogen bond network between water molecules.
In order to retain the network, the water molecules tend to form cagelike
ordered structures around the hydrophobic core at the cost of high
entropic loss. In order to minimize the effect of unfavorable entropy
change, the protein molecules tend to fold so as to reduce the surface
area of contact with the water molecules. An interesting fact is that
this entropy change associated with the hydrophobic effect depends
on the temperature. With an increase in temperature, the ordered cagelike
structure tends to break down, thus leading to a decrease in a negative
entropy effect. This leads to the gradual unfolding of the protein
with increasing temperature.55 The course
of denaturing action of GnHCl is related with their capacity to break
down the salt bridges that are responsible to stabilize the folded
structure of the protein.

In our experiments where we have monitored
the denaturation of
HSA at a temperature range 283–353 K and in the presence of
0–6 M GnHCl, we could find that the temperature has a less
effect to cause the denaturation of the two domains of the protein
as compared to GnHCl. In the absence of GnHCl, the degree of folding
of both domain-I and domain-III was found to decrease from 1.0 at
298 K to ∼0.7 at 353 K (Figure 5). However, the overall unfolding of the protein was
found to be more sensitive to temperature as the degree of folding
was found to vary from 1.0 at 298 K to ∼0.4 at 353 K (Figure 2). Also, at any given
concentration of GnHCl, the degree of folding due to the change in
temperature was not found to vary to a great extent. On the contrary,
the degree of folding of both the domains as well as the overall protein
decreased from 1 to 0 with an increase in the concentration of GnHCl
from 0 to 6 M (by definition, the degree of folding is 1 at 0 M GnHCl,
298 K, and is 0 at 6 M GnHCl, 298 K).

The two domains were also
found to show some differences in their
nature of unfolding because of GnHCl. In the case of domain-I, the
extent of unfolding due to GnHCl was more pronounced at lower temperature
(283 K) than at higher temperature (353 K), whereas in the case of
domain-III, this unfolding occurs more at higher temperature than
at lower temperature. This also leads to a surprising scenario where
the most unfolded state of domain-I of HSA in our temperature–GnHCl
combinations occurs near 283 K, 6 M GnHCl instead of 353 K, 6 M GnHCl.
However, in the case of domain-III, the most unfolded states occurred
near 353 K, 6 M GnHCl as expected. The overall denaturation of the
protein above 298 K follows an intermediate path, followed by domain-I
and domain-III. The stabilizing effect of domain-I at higher temperature
suggests that the DACIA molecule, which is bound to the Cys-34 position
of the domain-I of HSA, is slightly pushed into a more hydrophobic
environment because of the movement of protein side chains near that
site of the protein at higher temperatures.

The associated free
energy change of different parts of HSA was
evaluated by considering either a two-step or a three-step process
as given below.    where
N denotes the native state, I denotes
the intermediate state, and U denotes the unfolded state. The measured
degree of folding as a function of denaturant concentration for the
two-state and three-state processes thus can be represented by, respectively,56 6   7   8   9  

In the above equation, Y is the degree of folding
and YN, YI, and YU are the degree of folding for
the native, intermediate, and unfolded states, respectively. ΔG0 is the free energy change associated with
the concerned transition and m denotes the slope
of the free energy change plotted against the denaturant. R and T are the universal gas constant
and temperature in K, respectively.

Using the above model, we
have calculated the free energy change
associated with the domain-specific unfolding of HSA by either temperature
or GnHCl. A three-state model was adopted for the temperature-induced
unfolding of domain-I of HSA, and for all the other cases, a two-state
model was sufficient to fit the data (see Figure 13). The corresponding ΔG0 are tabulated in Table 5. The change in free energy associated with each of
the unfolding processes is positive, indicating that none of these
processes happens spontaneously. It could also be noted that the free
energy change associated with the GnHCl-induced unfolding is much
lesser than that of the temperature-induced unfolding, showing that
GnHCl is much more effective for HSA denaturation and domain-III is
more vulnerable than the domain-I of HSA.

folding of (a) domain-I of HSA, (b) domain-III
of HSA, and (c) overall structure of HSA due to the action of GnHCl
(red circles) and temperature (blue circles). The fitting of the data
using either a two-state or a three-state model is also shown.

Solvation times of DACIA tagged to domain-I of HSA
at different
temperatures and different concentrations of GnHCl are illustrated
in Figure 14. The
solvation time is found to generally decrease with an increase in
temperature or with an increase in GnHCl concentration. This change
is expected as the denaturation of HSA results in DACIA being located
in a less hydrophobic environment away from the protein core, where
the dynamics of water molecules are faster. As a result, the average
solvation time of DACIA tagged to domain-I of HSA decreased by 0.1
ns from 0.39 to 0.29 ns when the temperature was increased from 298
to 328 K and further decreased by 0.03 ns when the temperature was
increased to 348 K, in the absence of any GnHCl. The value of dynamic
Stokes shift also reduced monotonously when the temperature was changed
from 298 to 348 K. In the presence of 2 M GnHCl, the solvation time
decreased with an increase in temperature from 298 to 328 K, but the
change was only 0.02 ns (from 0.19 to 0.17 ns) which is only 1/5th
of the change we had observed for the corresponding change in temperature
in the absence of GnHCl. With further increase in temperature, the
average solvation time increased to 0.24 ns. This suggests that increasing
the temperature to the region of 348 K would slightly result in the
DACIA molecule being located in a more confined environment. Similar
changes could be observed in the presence of 5 M GnHCl, where the
average solvation time decreases only by 0.01 ns (from 0.16 to 0.15
ns) when the temperature is increased from 298 to 328 K and then increased
to 0.26 ns at 348 K. However, at all concentrations of GnHCl, the
value of dynamic Stokes shift decreases monotonously with temperature.

Figure 14 Average
solvation times of DACIA-tagged HSA at different temperatures
in the presence of different concentrations of GnHCl plotted over
the contour plot of extent of folding calculated from the steady-state
emission spectra.

The solvation dynamics
of NPCE tagged to domain-III of HSA was
found to be more intriguing than domain-I of HSA (see Figure 15). When the temperature was
increased from 298 to 328 K, the average solvation time decreased
sharply by a factor of 4 and 2 in the presence of 0 and 2 M GnHCl,
respectively, implying that the temperature has an immediate denaturing
effect on the domain-III of HSA. However, a further increase in temperature
to 348 K results in an increase in solvation time, suggesting that
denaturation near the binding site does not occur anymore and the
increase in temperature has a water structure making property near
domain-III. In the presence of 5 M GnHCl, such a phenomenon starts
even at a lower temperature, and as a result, the average solvation
time increases with temperature. At 328 and 348 K, the average solvation
time shows a monotonous increase with the increase in the concentration
of GnHCl. At lower temperature (298 K), the solvation time decreases
when the GnHCl concentration is increased from 0 M GnHCl to 2 M GnHCl
and then increases in the presence of 5 M GnHCl (Scheme 1).

of NPCE-tagged HSA at different temperatures
in the presence of different concentrations of GnHCl plotted over
the contour plot of extent of folding calculated from the steady-state
emission spectra.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation
of Domain-Specific Unfolding of HSA in Double
Denaturing Condition
The nature of change of associated
solvation dynamics is also represented through circular disk representation
(the larger the circle the larger the solvation time).

This study reveals that the course of denaturation for
domain-I
and domain-III of HSA is slightly different, which also differs from
the nature of the overall denaturation of the protein. The solvation
dynamics studies in the presence of denaturing agents, temperature
and GnHCl, at two particular regions (domain-I and domain-III) of
the protein show that the dynamics at these two regions follow quite
different pathways in response to the denaturing agents. This must
be due to the different confined environments in which the fluorophores
are located. The much slower solvation times of the NPCE molecule
tagged to domain-III of HSA suggest that relaxation of water molecules
is slower inside domain-III as compared to that of domain-I. Also,
in the case of DACIA-tagged HSA, denaturing agents cause a decrease
in solvation time in most of the experiments we had carried out, which
is expected. On the other hand, the solvation dynamics inside domain-III
reveals no trend on imposing the denaturation either by the temperature
of GnHCl. Increase in temperature or concentration of GnHCl sometimes
resulted in more confinement in the motion of water molecules inside
the protein core, which resulted in slower solvation at these sites.
The confinement of water molecules could have been caused because
of the orientation of side chains near the binding site of the fluorophore
or the stronger bonding of water molecules with the amino acid moieties.

4 Conclusions
To conclude, we have studied the effect
of GnHCl and temperature
on the overall structure, domain-I, and domain-III of HSA using covalent
fluorescent labels. The overall unfolding of HSA calculated using
CD spectroscopy showed that the unfolding of the protein molecule
is following the expected trend, where it is more unfolded at a higher
temperature and in the presence of GnHCl. The domain-specific unfolding
of domain-I and domain-III of HSA, calculated using steady-state emission
spectroscopy, also exhibited a slightly different behavior compared
to the overall unfolding. Thus, we proved that different parts of
HSA do not unfold sequentially. From solvation dynamics studies, it
was revealed that solvation inside the core of domain-III is much
slower than that inside the core of domain-I. This difference is attributed
to the different microenvironments at the core of the two domains,
which restrict the motion of water molecules at the respective sites.
This difference in local environments inside the two domains also
results in different responses of their solvation dynamics to the
denaturing agents, as the domain-I of HSA shows a more regular decrease
in solvation time because of higher temperature or presence of GnHCl,
whereas for domain-III of HSA, the change in solvation time with temperature
or concentration of GnHCl is more random.

5.2 Instrumentation
All steady-state
absorption spectra were recorded using a UV–visible spectrophotometer
(Shimadzu 2450, Japan). For recording, an emission spectra spectrofluorimeter
(FluoroMax-4, Jobin Yvon, USA) was used. A commercial CD spectrometer
(Jasco J-815, Japan) was used for recording CD spectra. Centrifugation
and lyophilization were done in Eppendorf centrifuge 5810R and Heto
VR-1 setup, respectively. Unless stated otherwise, all the experiments
were done at 298 K.

Time-resolved fluorescence decays were collected
using a commercial time-correlated single photon counting setup (LifeSpec-II,
Edinburgh Instruments, UK). Two different lasers were used for exciting
the samples. A 375 nm laser, EPL-375, Edinburgh Instruments, UK, was
used for exciting the samples with DACIA, and a 442 nm laser, EPL-445,
Edinburgh Instruments, UK, was used for exciting the samples with
NPCE. Peak counts of 8000 were collected for lifetime measurements.
The emission polarizer was oriented at the magic angle (54.7°).
Dilute ludox solution was used for the measurement of instrument response
function (IRF, which was found to be ∼120 ps. The contribution
of IRF was nullified by the iterative reconvolution method. A commercial
software, Fast, Edinburgh Instruments, UK, was used for this purpose.
The fluorescence transient decays were fitted using the equation 10  where I(t) is the fluorescence intensity at time t and fi is
the amplitude associated
with the fluorescence lifetime τi. The sum of f values is unity. We have used Igor
Pro software for further plotting and analysis.

The parameters
obtained after fitting the decay transients at different
wavelengths using the above equation were used for constructing the
TRES. The change in peak frequency with time obtained from the TRES
data was used to calculate the time-dependent Stokes shift. The solvent
correlation function, C(t), constructed
from the peak frequency is given by 11  where ν(0), ν(t), and
ν(∞) are the peak frequencies at time 0, t, and ∞, respectively.
