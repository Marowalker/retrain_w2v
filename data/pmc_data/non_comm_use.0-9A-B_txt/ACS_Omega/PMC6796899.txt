The thermodynamic study of the complexation
of the β-cyclodextrins
and p-sulfonatocalix[n]arenes (CnS) with the 4-aminoazobenzene was reported and was carried
out by molecular dynamics simulations. We determined the whole thermodynamic
properties (K, ΔrG°, ΔrH°, and TΔrS°) using the
potential of mean force (PMF) technique and more precisely the adaptive
biasing force method. Depending on both the nature of the host molecule
and the pH of the solution, the PMF profiles present different shapes
and energy minima. Considering the complexity of these PMF profiles,
we are also interested in the structural properties of these associations.
Hence, we calculated hydrogen bonds, Lennard-Jones and electrostatic
energies, the number of atoms of the guest molecule inserted inside
the cagelike host molecule, and the number of water molecules expelled
from the cavity.

1 Introduction
Host–guest
systems consist generally of two parts, the molecular
receptors (usually small molecules with a hydrophobic cavity such
as cyclodextrins (CD),1 calixarenes,2 or cucurbiturils3−5) and the guests that
are able to bind with both high affinity and/or selectivity. For technological
applications in the field of photoswitchable materials,6−11 azobenzene derivatives have been widely investigated and cyclodextrins
have been largely used as hosts for these derivatives. In the literature,
some stability constants are available revealing some discrepancies.12−18 In fact, supramolecular assemblies typically provide weak force
associations that are quite difficult to detect and quantify with
both precision and accuracy. Moreover, the experimental conditions
are usually so different that the values can hardly be compared.

We previously reported experimental and computational investigations
on the association of water-soluble macrocyclic hosts (β-cyclodextrin
and p-sulfonatocalixarenes) with 4-aminoazobenzene (4AA)19 in water (Figure 1). UV–visible spectroscopy was used to provide
the whole thermodynamic characterizations of the association (ΔrG, ΔrH,
and TΔrS). Molecular
simulations were also performed to interpret experimental results
and to obtain structural data for these complexes. The pH effect was
studied. Whereas the thermodynamic parameters found for β-cyclodextrin
were almost identical at the two pH values studied (pH 1 and 7), these
parameters differed significantly for p-sulfonatocalixarenes.
Stable inclusion complexes with calixarenes were found at acidic pH,
but our investigations were unable to confirm the inclusion of the
guest at neutral pH. Knowing that the binding abilities of such calixarenes
are dramatically pH-controlled, a weaker association was indeed expected.20 However, a clarification is required to provide
a definitive answer regarding the possible binding of the 4AA to calixarenes
at neutral pH.

Molecular description combined with thermodynamic characterization
using numerical experiments is an efficient approach for the study
of the binding process.21−26 In the present paper, we have re-examined the association process
using the free energy approach to obtain a thermodynamic characterization
using numerical experiments. This approach corresponds to the calculation
of the free energy along a reaction coordinate. The calculation of
the potential of mean force (PMF) along complex chemical reactions
was originally introduced by Kirkwood in 1935.27 The comparison between the binding properties previously
obtained from UV–visible spectroscopy for β-cyclodextrin
and p-sulfonatocalixarenes with 4-aminoazobenzene in water at acidic
pH allowed the validation of the computational procedures. As a result,
we have given a quantitative answer to the possible association between p-sulfonatocalixarenes and 4-aminoazobenzene in water at
neutral pH.

Section 2 discusses
the main results, and our conclusions are given in Section 3. Section 4 describes the calculation of the potential
of mean force using the adaptive biasing force (ABF) and of the corresponding
thermodynamic properties of association. The computational details
of the molecular dynamics are also provided.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 β-Cyclodextrin/4AA
The potential
of mean force characterizing the association process of the 4AA with
the β-cyclodextrin is shown in Figure 2 at pH = 7. No significant changes are observed
by changing the pH in concordance with our experimental results.19 The Gibbs free energy profile in Figure 2 shows some local minima characterized
by separation distances that clearly implies the insertion of the
4AA into the CD cavity in line with our previous results. Because
the azobenzene moiety is longer than the cyclodextrin cavity, the
4AA is included longitudinally in the β-cyclodextrin cavity
in perfect agreement with some reported NMR results.15 Interestingly, three quite different local minima were
found; the first at the distance of −1.3 Å is the deeper
free energy minimum. It corresponds to the configuration in which
the first phenyl ring of the azobenzene moiety is inside the cavity
with the hydrophilic head, the amino group, exposed to water. The
second minimum at 0.75 Å corresponds to the configuration in
which the two phenyls rings of azobenzene are exposed to the bulk
water. Finally, in the third minimum at 3.95 Å, it is the second
phenyl ring that is included in the cavity of β-cyclodextrin.

Figure 2 Gibbs
free energy profile obtained for the inclusion complex (β-Cd,
4AA) as a function of the reaction coordinate. In the inset, the PMF
is shown in the whole range of sampled separation distances.

To explain the driving forces of β-cyclodextrin
complexation,
we report in Figure 3a the energy contributions and in Figure 3b the percentage of inserted atoms into the
CD cavity at different separation distances. The number of water molecules
inside the cavity of CD is also detailed along the coordinate reaction
in Figure 3c. As expected
for an insertion complex with the β-CD, the van der Waals interaction
is predominant over the electrostatic energy contribution. A strong
correlation was also observed between the LJ contributions and the
number of inserted atoms. This contribution is more favorable between
the distance of −4 and 4 Å of the two centers of mass
when the percentage of inserted atoms is maximum. Note that the Lennard-Jones
(LJ) energy minimum corresponds to the first deeper Gibbs free energy
minimum of the PMF at −1.3 Å (Figure 2). Regarding the number of water molecules
inserted into the cavity, two minimums are shown at −0.7 and
3.3 Å, respectively (Figure 3b). These separation distances are in line with the
two local minima of the potential of mean force corresponding to the
locations of the two phenyl rings of azobenzene within the cavity.
Clearly, these conformations involve larger dehydration of the host.
We also observe that the cavity recovers some water molecules when
the two phenyl groups of 4AAB are exposed to water; this situation
corresponds to the second minimum at 0.75 Å in the free energy
profile (Figure 2).

Figure 3 (a) Energy
contributions as a function of the distance between
centers of mass for (β-Cd, 4AA). The blue curve corresponds
to the Lennard-Jones energy, the green to the electrostatic part,
and the red is the sum of both contributions. (b) Percentage of 4AA
atoms inserted inside the β-Cd cavity as a function of the distance
between centers of mass. (c) Number of water molecules inside the
host cavity as a function of the distance between the host and the
guest.

To conclude on these aspects,
these results indicate that the more
negative free energy minimum at −1.3 Å in the free energy
profile given in Figure 2 is a result of the combination of both the larger dehydration of
the cavity and the more negative LJ energy contributions. Finally,
for the same system, we have also reported the number of hydrogen
bonds formed by the 4AA with water molecules as a function of the
separation distance of the two centers of mass as illustrated in Figure 4. Obviously, as 4AA
penetrates into the cavity of the host, the total number of hydrogen
bonds formed by the 4AA decreases. As shown in Figure 4, this decrease is mainly due to the azo
group that is deeply inserted into the cavity, preventing any formation
of hydrogen bonds.

water
molecules. The colored curves correspond to a given type of H-bond,
whereas the black curve corresponds to the sum of all contributions.

2.2 Calixarenes/4AA
Now, we focus on
the potential of mean force characterizing the association process
of the 4AA into p-sulfonatocalixarenes in both neutral
and acidic solutions (Figure 5). It should be noted that compared to the previous system,
the 4AA does not pass through the cavity of the calixarenes. The results
obtained for C4S and C6S are rather similar in terms of the shape
and well depth of the PMF curve. However, the PMFs are strongly dependent
on the pH. Indeed, the PMF obtained in acidic solution shows deeper
minimum than in neutral medium and the location of 4AA into the cavity
is always deeper at pH = 1 (at 4.1 and 2.5 Å for C4S and C6S,
respectively) than that at pH = 7 (at 5.35 and 3.35 Å for C4S
and C6S, respectively). Interestingly, for both C4S and C6S at pH
= 7, one can observe a small energy barrier (about 5 kJ mol–1) that precedes the local free energy minimum.

Figure 5 Free energy profiles
obtained for (a) (C4S, 4AA) and (b) (C6S,
4AA). The plain line corresponds to acidic pH, whereas the dotted
line refers to the neutral medium.

We propose here to focus our attention on the C4S. To further understand
these PMFs, the partitioning of the free energy profiles into the
Lennard-Jones and electrostatic parts of the energy contributions
is reported as a function of the separation distance in Figure 6 for (C4S, 4AA) in water. The
total energy contributions are also reported in the same figure. At both pH values, the variations of the LJ contributions as a function
of the distance are similar. When the 4AA approaches the C4S, these
contributions become largely favorable, with the insertion of the
4AA into the cavity starting at a distance of about 8 Å. Figure 7a shows the percentage
of inserted atoms into the C4S cavity, and Figure 7b shows the number of water molecules inside
the host cavity. Interestingly, the more negative
LJ contribution at the Gibbs free energy minima in acidic medium corresponds
to 40% of the guest insertion, whereas it is only 20% in neutral solution.
In both cases, at the Gibbs free energy minima, the dehydration of
the cavity represents at least 50% of the total number of the water
molecules inside the cavity.

Figure 6 Energy contributions as a function of the distance
between centers
of mass for (C4S, 4AA) at (a) acidic pH and (b) neutral pH. The blue
curve corresponds to the Lennard-Jones energy, the green to the electrostatic
part, and the red is the sum of all contributions. The dotted lines
represent the location of the deep minimum in the PMF profile for
(C4S, 4AA).

Figure 7 (a) Percentage of 4AA atoms inserted inside
the C4S cavity as a
function of the distance between centers of mass. (b) Number of water
molecules inside the host cavity as a function of the distance between
the host and the guest. The dotted lines represent the location of
the deep minimum in the PMF profile for (C4S, 4AA).

According to the PMFs discussed above, it is clear that changing
the pH impacts significantly the electrostatic interactions. In acidic
medium, these contributions are negative and gradually decrease when
the guest approaches the cavity. On the contrary, the electrostatic
part is always positive along the host–guest separation distance
in the neutral medium. Interestingly, the penetration of 4AA into
the cavity (from a distance of 8 Å) is associated with an electrostatic
energy cost in both cases. Note that this cost is in the range of
400 kJ mol–1 at pH = 1, whereas it is rather on
the order of 40 kJ mol–1 at pH = 7. However, the
electrostatic energy remains largely negative and it is partially
compensated by the negative Lennard-Jones energy contribution in acidic
solution. This is no longer true in the neutral medium as shown in
the total energy contributions (Figure 6), as the energy balance is clearly unfavorable. This
leads to the small energy barrier mainly observed in the PMF curves
obtained in the neutral medium.

We propose here to explain these
unfavorable electrostatic terms
observed at 8 Å at both pH values and discussed above. To do
so, we assume that the guest changes its orientation to form the energetically
favored inclusion structure for complexes. In acidic solutions, the
approach of the guest to the cavity allows strong electrostatic interactions
of protonated 4AA with the sulfonate groups, with the amino group
of the guest being oriented toward the sulfonate groups of the C4S.
This orientation may also promote hydrogen bond formation between
the amino group of 4AA and oxygen atoms of sulfonate groups. Upon
complexation, the penetration into the host cavity of the phenyl part
of the guest rather than the amino group will enhance its hydrophobic
interactions with C4S. As a consequence, the orientation of the guest
must change. To validate this hypothesis, we will deeply investigate
the orientation coefficient α and the hydrogen bonds in the
following part.

Further insight into the orientation of the
guest as a function
of the separation distance may be obtained from the calculation of
α value. This parameter depends on the orientation of the guest
within the calixarene cavity as explained in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). Three zones are defined, and at
larger separation distances of the two centers of mass (zone C), a
significantly larger α value (α > 1) is calculated.
This
result confirms a privileged position of the amino group toward the
sulfonate groups, especially true in acidic solution (with the protonated
4AA). In zone B, the α value fluctuates in agreement with the
change in the guest orientation upon complexation. Finally, the insertion
of the guest inside the cavity leads to a smaller value of α
(Zone A) that is thoroughly consistent with the penetration of the
phenyl part of 4AA rather than the amino group.

Finally, we
also report in Figure 8 the total number of hydrogen bonds as a function of
the separation distance for both pH values. We observe that the total
number of hydrogen bonds is fewer at pH = 7 than that at pH = 1. From
10 Å, the amino group of 4AA forms hydrogen bonds with the sulfonate
group of C4S. Upon complexation, these H-bonds are replaced by H-bonds
with the oxygens of the water due to the change in the 4AA orientation
in agreement with the fluctuation of the α value. Once the insertion
has been made, the amino group is able to recover hydrogen bonds with
the sulfonate groups as shown in Figure 8. This leads to a favorable negative electrostatic
energy obtained from 5 Å as shown in Figure 6. As a conclusion, the formation of H-bonds
and the evolution of α validate our hypothesis previously made.

Figure 8 H-bonds
formed as a function of the distance between centers of
mass for (C4S, 4AA) association at (a) acidic pH and (b) neutral pH.
The colored curves correspond to a given type of H-bond, whereas the
black curve corresponds to the sum of all H-bonds. The dotted lines
represent the location of the deep minimum in the PMF profile for
(C4S, 4AA).

Unambiguously, the small energy
barriers obtained at 7.75 and 7.5
Å for C4S and C6S, respectively, at pH = 7 are related to the
fact that the orientation of the guest is changed upon complexation.
As already mentioned in the Introduction part,
our previous results19 tend to show that
the 4AA is not significantly complexed by both C4S and C6S in neutral
medium. The calculation of the free energy profiles obtained here
and the presence of these barriers give a quantitative answer regarding
this complexation and confirm that there is no association between
the calixarene and the 4AA in water, in perfect agreement with our
experimental and simulation results.19 The
same conclusions can be drawn for the (C6S, 4AA) association from
the analysis of Figures S2–S4 (see
the Supporting Information).

2.3 Thermodynamics Properties
The thermodynamic
properties of the association calculated from the PMFs are reported
in Table 1. As underlined
in the methodological section, the calculation of the thermodynamic
properties requires the knowledge of the d parameter.
The dependence of the calculation on the value of d is shown for each complex in Figures S7–S9 (see the Supporting Information). In the case of the complex studied
here, the use of eqs 7–9 represents an approximation because
of the nonsphericity of the conformations of the guest and the host.
However, we can estimate the thermodynamic properties that are listed
in Table 1. For each
calculation, we report the value of d, which remains
reasonable for an association in terms of separation distances.

c d = rmin + 2.5 Å.

d d = rmin + 1.5 Å.

The calculation of the thermodynamic
properties of the association
from the PMFs shows a weak association in line with experimental interpretations.
The complexes are characterized by the insertion of the guest into
the host in line with negative values of ΔrH°. The values of the Gibbs free energy of association
are on the same order of magnitude as those obtained from spectroscopy.
In the case of the calixarenes, the deviation between simulations
and experiments does not exceed 10% on the values of the enthalpy.
The largest deviation is obtained with the β-Cd and can be explained
by the fact that the reaction path is much more complicated for this
association process. Indeed, the host molecule is then accessible
from both sides and the guest is longitudinally inserted. These two
features make the original assumptions of the spherical shapes of
the guest and the host no longer valid. The deviation of the value
of the enthalpy explains the change in the sign of the entropic term.

There are two predominant effects that influence the entropy effects:
the loss of degrees of freedom and the desolvation of both guest and
host molecules. From our simulation results, we saw that the entropic
term is negative for all complexes. The loss of degrees of freedom
is rather predominant. Nevertheless, for (BCD, 4AA) association, the
value of the entropy is higher than the one for (CnS, 4AA) associations. This implies that the loss of degrees of freedom
is higher for CnS than for BCD. These results are
in perfect agreement with the ones we previously obtained.19

3 Conclusions
Molecular
simulations have been performed to calculate the potential
of mean force in the association between the 4AA and C4S, C6S, and
β-CD in water. The calculation of PMF represents a valuable
property to definitely conclude on the association between two molecules.
The PMFs have been calculated using the method of the adaptive biasing
force. Indeed, these PMFs can help in the interpretation of experiments
when the experimental data do not allow a definitive conclusion of
the association in neutral medium. The shape of the simulated PMF
was rather complex, and additional simulations were performed to investigate
the changes in the structure and energy along the reaction coordinate.

In a neutral medium, we have demonstrated that an energetic barrier
of about 5 kJ mol–1 prevents any association, as
suggested by experiments. This is the main conclusion of this work.
We have also explained the reasons for the formation of the energetic
barrier from the analysis of the van der Waals and electrostatic energy
contributions. In acidic medium, the simulations confirm a weak association
and an insertion complex in terms of thermodynamic properties. These results agree with experiments
showing that the process is enthalpically favored. We conclude that
only a combined approach of molecular simulations (structure and energetics)
and experiments is able to elucidate the formation of these weak complexes.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Methodology
4.1.1 Adaptive Biasing Force
The adaptive biasing force (ABF) method is an adaptative method that
computes the potential of mean force w(ξ) along
a reaction coordinate ξ. It was designed by Darve et al.28,29 in 2001. Since then, many improvements have been proposed. For example,
we could cite the extended-system adaptive biasing force (eABF) designed
by Lesage et al.30 or more recently the
meta-eABF designed by Fu et al.31 In ABF
method, the total reaction coordinate ξ is divided in an appropriate
number of bins. For each bin, the mean force, ⟨Fξ|ξ*⟩, is evaluated from a running
average 1  By applying an opposite force −⟨Fξ|ξ*⟩, the total average
force acting on this system becomes close to zero after a brief equilibration.
This allows avoiding significant energy barriers. The reaction coordinate
is then well sampled. Now, let us look at the way we can compute the
potential of mean force (PMF) with this method. By considering that nk(Nstep) is the number of samples collected in bin k after Nstep, the running average force Fξk acting on ξ in the bin k is expressed
as 2  where  corresponds to the lth
force sample when ξ is in the bin k. In the
LAMMPS collective variable module, the average force for the ABF method
is calculated from 3  with
α(Nξ) being a scaling factor
(going from 0 to 1) depending on the number
of samples Nξ and ∇G̃(ξ) the estimate of the gradient of free energy
for the point ξ in the reaction coordinate. Finally, the Gibbs
free energy along the reaction coordinate from a state a to b, ΔGa→b, can be obtained by integrating the
total biased force according to 4  Nevertheless, if the sampling is poor for
a given bin k (typically at the beginning of the
simulation), it is possible to have a nonequilibrium effect due to
poor estimation of ⟨Fξ|ξ*⟩
that leads to an incorrect bias. To avoid these effects, we multiply Fξk by a function R(nk(Nstep)) = min(1, nk(Nstep)/n0). In practice,
we took n0 = 200. The running average
force becomes 5  

4.1.2 Thermodynamic Properties
The thermodynamic
properties of the association are calculated from the profile of the
potential of mean force (PMF). The association constant32Ka can be calculated
using the following expression 6  where NA corresponds
to the Avogadro constant, kB to the Boltzmann
constant, and w(h) to the PMF profile. rcyl corresponds to the mean radius of the cylinder
where the guest can freely evolve for its in-plane movement when it
is associated inside the cavity. This mean radius is calculated at
each step h of the reaction coordinate. When the
guest molecule is out of the cavity, we consider rcyl as a constant equal to the highest
value (i.e., when the guest is placed above the bigger rim). The parameter d, which is introduced in the different integrations, defines
the upper limit of the association in terms of separation distances.
This is not an easy parameter to define especially when the shapes
of the guest and hosts are no longer spherical and quite different
between different association processes. We took the route of representing
different integrals as a function of the d parameter
in the Supporting Information (Figures S7–S9).

The derived properties of the association such as the Gibbs
free energy, enthalpy, and entropy can be calculated using the following
expressions 7   8   9  

4.2 Computational Details
As shown by
experimental results,19 the stoichiometry
of these complexes is 1:1. As a consequence, the simulation boxes
were composed of one host, e.g., a calixarene (see Figure 1c for C4S) or a β-Cd
(Figure 1a); one guest,
e.g., a 4AAB (Figure 1b); and 2000 water molecules. To maintain charge neutrality in the
box, we may add, if needed, some Cl– or Na+. Our simulation boxes were cubic with a box length of 42 Å.
The periodic boundary conditions were applied in the three directions.
A scheme of each molecule is given along with the nomenclature in
the Supporting Information (Figures S1–S3).

Concerning the force fields, we chose the TIP4P2005 model
for water molecules33 and the General AMBER
Force Field (GAFF) for hosts and guests molecules.34 However, for the guest molecule, the dihedral angle C–N=N–C
was taken from the work of Heinz et al.35 MD simulations were performed with the LAMMPS package.36 The simulation parameters were chosen as follows:The SHAKE algorithm37 was
used to constrain H-based bonds and the HOH angle for water.

Lennard-Jones crossing parameters were calculated
using
Lorentz–Berthelot rules (i.e.,  and , where i and j refer to the force
centers and ϵ and σ are the energy
parameter and diameter of atoms of types i and j, respectively).

Our simulations
were performed in the NPT ensemble with
a velocity-Verlet integrator and a timestep of 2 fs.

We used a Langevin38,39 thermostat
with a relaxation time of 2 ps and kept the temperature fixed at 300
K.

A Berendsen barostat40 was
used with a relaxation time of 2 ps and a bulk modulus of 1000 atm.
The pressure was kept fixed at 1 atm.

We considered both long-range dispersion–repulsion
tail correction41 and long-range electrostatic
interactions. Long-range Coulomb interactions were calculated using
the PPPM style (particle-particle particle-mesh) with a relative error
force of 10–4 which maps atom charge to a three-dimensional
mesh.42,43



Our simulations
were composed of an equilibration phase of 1 ns
and an acquisition phase of 140 ns for a PMF going from 0 to 15 Å
(280 ns for PMF going from −15 to 15 Å).
