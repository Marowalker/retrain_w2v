Enlarging the dispersed micropores
of metal-organic frameworks
to the well-ordered mesostructure can enhance the accessibility of
acidic sites for reactants resulting in the improvement of selectivity.
With the regulation of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/Cr3+ and ClSO3H sulfonation, a series of mesoporous MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H (MMSs) with multiple pore sizes and acidic properties were
synthesized and explored to further facilitate the furfuryl alcohol
(FA) ethanolization to ethyl levulinate (EL) for the first time. The
optimal catalytic activity of 83.8% EL yield at full FA conversion
demonstrated that the appropriate mesopore size, acidic density, and
accessible −SO3H sites contributed to the superior
performance of the MMS(0.3)-0.15. The turnover frequency value (14.8
h–1) obtained with MMS(0.3)-0.15 was comparable
to the commercial Nafion NR50 (18.3 h–1) and much
higher than the classical Amberlyst-15 (1.9 h–1),
confirming the predominant catalytic performance. Furthermore, two
coexistent reaction paths with 2-ethoxymethylfuran and 4,5,5-triethoxy-pentan-2-one
as intermediates indicated the possibility of producing EL from FA.

1 Introduction
The
valorization of abundant and reproducible biomass into biofuels
and platform chemicals caters to the sustainable development strategy
alleviating global warming and dependency on fossil fuels. In the
past few decades, researchers devoted tremendous attention to the
preparation of heterogeneous acid catalysts1−6 such as N-doped carbon-based acidified IL hollow nanospheres,7 metal–acid bifunctional catalyst (Au-H4SiW12O40/ZrO2),8 hollow carbon mesospheres functionalized with
arylsulfonic acid (e.g., ArSO3H-HMCSs),9 and acidic niobia catalysts loaded with Zn-exchanged tungstophosphoric
(Zn1TPA/Nb2O5),10 and utilized them for the fabrication of alkyl levulinates
(ALs).11−14 The platform molecules, ALs, have attracted enormous attention because
of their wide applications in fragrance industries and as biofuel
additives15 and precursors to prepare γ-valerolactone.16 The mentioned catalysts with better acidity
and texture properties (e.g., acidic density, good dispersity, and
mesoporous and uniform structure) showed good to excellent catalytic
efficiency in the alcoholysis of furfuryl alcohol (FA). The literature
survey reveals that catalysts with appropriate acidity, excellent
texture, low-cost raw materials, and facile preparation protocols
are rarely studied, but are of high demand.

Owing to the high
specific surface area, adjustable pore size,
as well as numerous and versatile Lewis sites or functional sites
derived from coordinative unsaturated metal sites (CUS),17 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) draw tremendous
attention. Nevertheless, most porous MOFs are still confined to the
microporous system (pore size < 2 nm), which are widely applied
in gas storage,18 adsorption and separation,19 and molecular sensing,20 with the micropores limiting the diffusion and effective mass transfer,
especially in catalysts. It is unprecedented to create the mesostructure
MOFs for improving the accessibility of bulky molecular to active
species, reaction rates,21 and product
yields, as well as to expand the application of MOFs in more areas.
The method to lengthen the linker to expand the pore size cannot guarantee
the framework stability and interpenetration in the MOFs.22 As a result, the introduction of hierarchical
mesopores into MOFs with mesostructure by quoting structure-directing
agents to attain stable mesoporous MOFs with tunable structures and
controlled catalytic properties remains a significant challenge.23,24 Conveniently, P123, F127, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)
were chosen to increase the pore size and adjust the material structures
of MOFs. However, P123 and F127 are expensive, which could further
affect the development of mesostructured MOFs.25−27 Thus, it can
be seen that CTAB micelles are a promising candidate and the combination
of 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) to be an structural guide agent to
swell CTAB is a potential investigation.

Albeit suitable for
broadening application in more areas with mesostructure
MOFs, the functionalized meso-MOFs are still in blank, especially
in catalytic biomass conversion, to the best of our knowledge. A comparison
of the materials preparation28,29 in acidic functionalization
highlights that the relatively facile and massive method to adjust
the approachable acidic sites is the postsynthesis approach.30−32

Herein, we investigate for the first time a facile and feasible
strategy that has driven us to reasoningly conceive and prepare hierarchically
micro- and mesoporous structure-functionalized MOFs with tunable pore
size, pore volume, surface area, and acidic density. Cationic surfactant
CTAB was chosen as a primary structure-directing agent, while Cr3+ and terephthalate (BDC2–) ions as framework-building
blocks, followed by chlorosulfonic acid (ClSO3H) postsynthetic
treatment to design and prepare the expected mesoporous materials
MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H (MMS). Specifically, the mesoporous walls
in these hierarchical MOFs are composed of crystalline micropores,
including three-dimensional channels with 1.41 nm aperture. The novel
development of heterogeneous catalytic conversion for the formation
of ethyl levulinate (EL) from FA caters to the urgent demand, for
avoiding the severe environmental pollution, equipment damage, and
difficulty in separation and purification and evaluating the creatively
hierarchically micro- and mesoporous structure-functionalized MMS.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Catalysts
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns for the pristine M(0) in the absence of
CTAB and the mesoporous samples with different CTAB/Cr3+ molar ratios. The diffraction peaks of M(0) and MS(0) are in accordance
with the standard simulated pattern, and no new crystalline phases
or impurity spectra were formed. However, the gradually weaker and
broader diffraction peaks in Figure 1d–i reveal that the smaller and lower crystals
on nanoscale guide the formation of mesostructure MOFs according to
the literature.33−35 From this, we can obtain that lower crystallinity
and more irregular mesostructure grew with increase of the CTAB/Cr3+ molar ratios and the sulfonation treatment to accelerate
it, which is consistent with a previous report.34 All of the results emphasize the key role of CTAB in the
hybrid structure composed of micropores and well-defined mesopores.

Figure 1 XRD patterns

MM(0.15), (e) MMS(0.15), (f) MM(0.3), (g) MMS(0.3), (h) MM(0.6), and
(i) MMS(0.6).

The field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images
of M(0) with the CTAB/Cr3+ molar ratio of 0 show typical
octahedra morphologies and possess nanocrystals of size ca. 1 μm
(Figure 2a), which
is consistent with the neat MIL-101(Cr).35 Different morphologies of the mesostructure samples are obtained
by increasing the CTAB/Cr3+ molar ratios to 0.15, 0.3,
and 0.6, with gradual growth of the ca. 600 nm length and ca. 100
width bunchy crystal assembly of regular crystalline size ranging
from 100 to 200 nm (Figure 2b–d), which indicates the existence of mesoporous samples
with crystallinity nanoscale particles, and the mesopore walls were
formed from the crystalline microporous framework. The observed results
suggested that CTAB showed obvious effects on crystal morphologies
of MIL-101, in good agreement with the XRD observation, resulting
in nanocrystals with a rough outside surface.

(b) MM(0.15), (c) MM(0.3), (d) MM(0.6),
(e) MS(0), (f) MMS(0.15), (g) MMS(0.3), and (h) MMS(0.6).

The sulfonation reaction did not comparably influence
the morphology
(Figure 2e–h),
but there was a slight reduction of particle size. Nevertheless, obvious
smaller crystallite aggregates of UiO-66(Zr) appeared with particle
size increasing from 100–200 nm to ca. 1.5 μm (Figure S2), which confirmed the instability of
UiO-66(Zr)-SO3H36 and corroborated
well with the XRD results (see Figure S1).

Several representative transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images
of the well-defined mesoporous structure with different scale plates
are displayed in Figure 3. The uniform bright spots and the dark spots in Figure 3a,d in 20 nm exhibit the presence
of nanometric crystallites guided by CTAB. The emergence of bunchy
crystals demonstrates the construction of mesopore walls from uniform
nanocrystal and random connection without long-range and regular order,
which is in accordance with the SEM images and the reported disordered
wormhole mesopore structures.26 The diameter
distribution of the MM(0.3) and MMS(0.3) has been estimated based
on 50 points in the TEM results using software “Nano Measurer
1.2”, and their average particle sizes were found to be ca.
58.5 and 41.1 nm, respectively (Figure 4).

(0.3) with

The porosity and the texture property
parameters of the mesostructured
MOFs affected by various CTAB/Cr3+ molar ratios are investigated
by the N2 adsorption–desorption method, and the
results are shown in Table 1. The mesostructure with functionalization by ClSO3H-treated and nontreated MOFs adjusted at CTAB/Cr molar ratios of
0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 exhibits the regulatable pore size, SBET, pore volume, and titration. As listed in Table 1, the mesoporous pore
size of these mesoscale MOFs with and without ClSO3H functionalization
increases from 4.57 to 7.33 nm and from 2.41 to 3.23 nm, respectively,
by enhancing the molar ratio of CTAB/Cr3+ from 0.15 to
0.60. Therefore, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific
surface area (SBET) and pore volume of
the nontreated MOFs decreases rapidly and presents an even more steep
glide trend of the functionalized ones; TEM and BET (pore size distribution)
analyses manifest the catalyst structure being composed of micropores
and well-defined mesopores, matching well with the characterization
of XRD and SEM.

b The amount of sulfonic acid sites
was tested by acid–base titration.

The mesopore walls were assembled by the crystalline
microporous
framework within the designed mesostructured samples concluded from
the XRD, SEM, and TEM analyses, which is further demonstrated by analysis
of the distribution of pore sizes for MM(0.3) and MMS(0.3) (Figure S4). As shown in Figure S4, the solids contain micropores with diameters of 0.42 and
0.49 nm for MM(0.3) and MMS(0.3), respectively, which is much smaller
than the micropore diameter (1.41 nm) detected from the pristine M(0)26 due to the smaller particles and lower crystallinity.
The pronounced H4 hysteresis loop located at high P/P0 (P/P0 = 0.3–1.0) revealed the existence of the mesoporous
channels in the observed samples in type IV isotherm of Figure 5. The catalyst pore size distribution
(Figure 4) is consistent
with the H4 hysteresis loop, confirming the presence of mesopores
in the materials.

2.2 Effect
of CTAB-Cr3+ Molar Ratio
on the Catalytic Performance of MMS in FA Ethanolization for EL
The aforementioned characterization demonstrated that CTAB and
sulfonation process modified and adjusted the porosity and the texture
properties of the M(0) for the mesostructured MOFs. The direct relationships
between the porosity of MOFs and the catalytic activity are established
in Figure 6; the gap
between the FA conversion and yields might be attributed to the load
of trace product in the pores of MOFs (EL conv., 5.7%; room temperature
(rt); 2 h) and the generation of intermediates and byproducts (Figure S8 and Table S1).

Figure 6 Influence of CTAB-Cr
molar ratio on MMS catalytic activity in FA
ethanolization for EL. Reaction conditions: molar ratio of FA/EtOH
= 1:60, 50 mg catalyst, 140 °C, and 2 h.

Hence, more detailed investigations of the effect of the
porosity
and the texture properties of MOFs on the conversion of FA to EL were
performed for comparing the series MMSs and the initial catalyst MS
prepared by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Without the sulfonation
treatment, MM(0.15), MM(0.3), and MM(0.6) showed poor catalytic performance
for the transformation of FA, which was comparable to the blank experiment
with 18.5% FA conversion. However, catalysis by M(0) achieved high
conversion (>40%), which can be ascribed to the Lewis acidic sites
for the CUS (coordination of unsaturated metal sites).37 As can be seen from Table 1Atitration,
the sulfonated treated ones (MS(0), MMS(0.15), MMS(0.3), and MMS(0.6))
showed the highest EL yield, up to 76.3%, with the changeable acidic
density from 0.36, 0.62, and 0.65 to 0.72 mmol/g, which indicated
the key role of the superior acidic density of MMS(0.3) modified by
ClSO3H. Meanwhile, the mesoporous structures of MS(0) (1.40
nm), MMS(0.15) (4.57 nm), MMS(0.3) (7.26 nm), and MMS(0.6) (7.33 nm)
are capable of facilitating the diffusion of the reactants to the
active center −SO3H, which is well supported by
the enhanced catalytic performance (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Influence of pore size on the catalytic activity
in ethanolysis
of FA to EL. Reaction conditions: molar ratio of FA/EtOH = 1:60, 50
mg catalyst, 140 °C, and 2 h.

2.3 Conversion of FA into EL with MMS Prepared
Using Variable ClSO3H Amounts
Mesostructure MOF
MMSs were prepared via postsulfonation treatments of ClSO3H, and the influence of the amount of ClSO3H on the samples
properties was investigated. Both Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
(Figure S3) and acid–base titration
results (Table 2) verified
the successful sulfonation of −SO3H in MMSs. The
results exhibited in Table 2 imply that the Brønsted acid density of −SO3H in MOF–SO3Hs is reduced in the order MS
(1.01 mmol/g) > MMS(0.3)-0.25 (0.87 mmol/g) > MMS(0.3)-0.20
(0.72
mmol/g) > MMS(0.3)-0.15 (0.65 mmol/g) > MMS(0.3)-0.10 (0.51
mmol/g)
> MMS(0.3)-0.05 (0.15 mmol/g), and the homologous ethanolysis of
FA
to EL in EtOH at 140 °C for 2 h with MOF–SO3Hs show a hill-shaped trend. An initial experiment was conducted
to explore the effect of the MS prepared by the one-pot hydrothermal
synthesis with the functionalized linker (H2BDC–SO3Na) on the FA-to-EL transformation. Only 59.4% of EL yield
was obtained with higher −SO3H density of MS, which
is attributed to the speculation that high acid density may have adverse
effects on the EL yield via FA conversion.38 The catalytic performance of MS is consistent with the mesostructured
ones, such as MMS(0.3)-0.25 and MMS(0.3)-0.20 with lower EL yields
of 66.4 and 69.2% (Table 2, runs 6 and 7), respectively. For MMS(0.3)-0.15 with a medium
Brønsted acidity density of 0.65 mmol/g, an EL yield of 76.3%
was observed with a full FA conversion (Table 2, run 5). Decreasing the −SO3H density to 0.15 and 0.51 mmol/g, the EL yields draw down to 16.6
and 68.9% (Table 2,
runs 3 and 4), respectively. In this regard, the catalytic efficiency
of MMSs for the FA-to-EL transformation is a function of the −SO3H functionalization same as the sulfonic acid-site density.

2.4 EL Production from FA Promoted by Different
Catalysts
To explore the optimal catalyst with appropriate
physicochemical properties, we compared the activities of the typical
and different heterogeneous catalysts for the production of EL from
FA (Table 3), before
which various parameters affecting the conversion were optimized for
the optimum EL yield. Under the specified reaction conditions (Figures S6–S8), the conversion of FA into
EL was demonstrated to proceed through the relatively stable intermediates,
including 2-ethoxymethylfuran (2-EMF), 4,5-diethoxy-5-hydroxypentan-2-one
(DHP), and 4,5,5-triethoxy-pentan-2-one (TEP). As the catalyst with
moderate acid density, it can facilitate the conversion of FA to the
intermediates, thus affording comparable FA conversion to that with
more acid-site content. Further increasing the catalyst acid density
is able to afford relatively high EL yields, while the use of excess
catalyst may generate byproducts with decreased EL yield. Thus, 50
mg of catalyst with a 1:60 mole ratio of EtOH at 160 °C for 2
h was obtained as the best condition.

was tested by acid–base titration.

d Adopted from ref (39).

UiO-66(Zr)-SO3H showed the least activity for the formation
of EL and gave 29.3% yield after 2 h, while the MMS(0.3)-0.15 sulfonated
by 0.15 mL of ClSO3H mesostructured MOF shows the highest
performance compared to the other catalysts used in the system. The
latter has more acidity and larger mesopores than the former, and
the moderate Brønsted acidity combined with Lewis acidity,37 derived from the mesopore walls contributed
from M(0), has been investigated and found to give a relatively higher
EL yield. Nevertheless, MMS(0.3)-0.15 by postsynthesis suffered the
drastic reduction of SBET (197 m2/g) compared to the one-pot MS (1492 m2/g). Hence, we
can conclude that the catalyst with synergistic physicochemical properties,
moderate mesopores, and acidity contribute to the better activity
for EL yield. To confirm it, evaluation parameter of various catalysts
was correlated with the turnover frequency (TOF) value in Figure 8. MMS(0.3)-0.15 is
comparable to the industrialized Nafion NR50, though only 71.7% for
the EL yield.

Figure 8 Yield of EL per acid site (TOF (h–1)).
Reaction
conditions: molar ratio of FA/EtOH = 1:60, 50 mg MMS(0.3)-0.15, 160
°C, and 2 h.

2.5 Catalyst
Recycling
To evaluate the
stability of the sulfonated solid acid catalyst (MMS(0.3)-0.15), we
have performed the five-cycle ethanolysis of FA with EtOH to synthesize
EL (Figure 9). After
the reaction finished, the catalyst has been separated by centrifugation,
filtration, washing with EtOH several times, and drying in a vacuum
oven at 80 °C for more than 24 h to be reused in the next run.
No regeneration was done. The FT-IR bands assigned to −SO3H groups in the fresh and recovered catalysts remained unchanged
(Figure S8), confirming the stability of
the hybrid framework and the catalytic active sites. The yield of
EL was found to decrease significantly from 83.8 to 66.6% after 2
h, and the EMF yields appeared in the fourth and fifth cycles, indicating
that the yield change can be correlated with the blockage of pores
or active sites. The accumulated oligomeric byproducts generated from
the reaction process resulted in the blockage and even the decrease
in acidity, which suppresses the access of reactants to the catalytic
sites, thus resulting in the reduction of the catalytic activity in
the recycles. Moreover, the thermogravimetric (TG) curves of the fresh
and recovered catalysts disclose that the recovered MMS(0.3)-0.15
shows more weight loss compared to the fresh one, confirming the accumulation
of oligomeric byproducts into the catalyst.

molar ratio of FA/EtOH = 1:60, 50 mg MMS(0.3)-0.15, 160 °C, and

2.6 Possible
Mechanism
Two most feasible
ways for the FA ethanolization to EL are proposed (Scheme 1), considering the indented
intermediates and byproducts (Figure S10 and Table S1), according to the reported literature.40,41 A possible mechanism with two coexisting paths of FA transformation
to EL is as follows: (1) (i) The protonation of the oxygen atom of
furan ring, (ii) the protonated one further undergoes etherification
reaction to form 2-EMF, and (iii) the acidification of which is then
transferred toward EL, as exhibited in path 1 (Scheme S1). (2) Another path course contains the step of the
protonation as well: (i) The protonation of hydroxyl group of FA toward
intermediates 4,5-diethoxy-5-hydroxypentan-2-one (DHP) and 4,5,5-triethoxy-pentan-2-one
(TEP), (ii) DHP attacked by EtOH again to convert into TEP with the
delivery of water, and (iii) DHP and TEP all can release micromolecule
to give the desired product EL. 2-EMF, DHP, and TEP tested by gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) all exist in this investigated
system. Hence, from this investigation, it is clear that the coexistence
of the two paths has the highest possibility.

Scheme 1 Possible Reaction
Pathways for the Conversion of Furfuryl Alcohol
(FA) to Ethyl Levulinate (EL) in EtOH over the Acidic Catalyst
Furthermore, the relative amount
of the main product and intermediates
for different times at 120 °C was identified by GC-MS (Table S2). The data analysis suggests that there
is the formation of 2-EMF in path 1, the content of which is higher
than the total intermediates of DHP and TEP in path 2 for the conversion
of TEP to EL, which is endothermic as evidenced by thermodynamics,42 in the preparation of EL. Meanwhile, the presence
of 2-EMF, DHP, and TEP indicates the possible reaction course that
the conversion mostly proceeds via paths 1 and 2, simultaneously.

3 Conclusions
Various MMSs were developed to
improve the potential as efficient
heterogeneous catalysts for the FA-to-EL conversion process. MMS(0.3)-0.15
possessed enhanced mesopore size and appropriate acidic density and
exhibited superior catalytic performances with 100% FA conversion
and 83.8% yield of EL at 160 °C in 2 h. The catalytic activity
suggested a complicated interaction between tunable texture and acidity
of the catalysts, where the increased mesostructure may enhance the
effective approachability of the catalytic sites during the reaction
course. The high TOF value of MMS(0.3)-0.15 demonstrated the overall
property, including the physicochemical properties. Catalyst recycling
studies of the spent MMS(0.3)-0.15 catalyst suggested a fairly good
catalyst stability. The exploration of reaction mechanism revealed
the existence of the two possible paths.

autoclave, which was heated to 493 K and kept for 8 h. After cooling
to rt, the reaction product was extracted three times with ethanol
to remove the template (CTAB/TMB) from the framework (ca. 1 g of powder
and 100 mL of ethanol). Ultimately, the obtained solid was dried at
423 K in a vacuum oven to achieve the constant weight, powderlike
MM. To explore the structure effect of CTAB, a mixture of CTAB/Cr(NO3)3·9H2O with different molar ratios
of 0, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 was prepared and the resulting sample was
coined as M(0) or MM(x) (x denotes
the CTAB/Cr3+ molar ratio).

4.2.2 Sulfonation
of MIL-101(Cr) and Mesoporous
MIL-101(Cr)
The activated MIL-101(Cr) (0.25 g) was stirred
in 7.5 mL of CH2Cl2 for 20 min at rt; then,
ClSO3H in 2.5 mL of CH2Cl2 was added
under even stirring conditions.29 After
4 h, the resulting solid was filtered off and flushed with CH2Cl2 and ethanol before the neutral filter liquor
was obtained and dried to give mesoporous MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H. UiO-66(Zr)-SO3H was synthesized following the same
synthetic procedure. The amount of the ClSO3H for the preparation
of MMS(0.3) with 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25 mL per 0.25 g of MM
was varied to further investigate the acid density effect in the reaction
system, and the corresponding catalysts are denoted as MMS(0.3)-y (y denotes the used amount of ClSO3H). The general MMS(x) were sulfonated by
0.15 mL of ClSO3H per 0.25 g of MM, i.e., MMS(0.3) denotes
the sulfonation of mesoporous MIL-101(Cr)(0.3) with different amounts
of ClSO3H, while MMS(0.3)-0.15 denotes the treatment of
0.25 g of MM(0.3) with 0.15 mL of ClSO3H. For comparison,
MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H (MS) and UiO-66(Zr) were also synthesized
by following the reported methods.43−45

4.3 Catalyst Characterization
The crystal
structures were demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000)
with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) at a scanning rate
of 0.5 °/min. The porosity specialities of the MOFs were measured
by nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at −196
°C by a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. FT-IR spectra were confirmed
using a Nicolet 360 FT-IR spectrometer, and the samples were prepared
by the KBr pellet. The extent of sulfonation and the sulfonic acid
amounts of MMS were detected by acid–base titration using saturated
NaCl solution to confirm the ion exchange. MMS (0.5 g) was suspended
in 20 g of aqueous NaCl saturated solution. The mixed suspension was
stirred at rt for more than 24 h to reach equilibrium, using 30 mL
of deionized water for the next filtration and washing. Eventually,
the achieved filtrate was titrated by 0.1 M NaOH solution. The morphologies
of the MOFs were characterized by a field emission scanning electron
microscope (Zeiss SUPRA 55) operating at 20 kV. Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) results were provided by combined Philips Tecnai
20 and JEOL JEM-2010 HR-TEM at 200 kV.

4.4 Typical
Process for Furfuryl Alcohol Transformation
into Ethyl Levulinate
FA (0.1 mL, 1.15 mmol), MMS (50 mg),
and EtOH (4 mL, 69.00 mmol) were mixed into a 25 mL stainless steel-coated
liner with a screw cap. The reactor was placed into an oil bath and
kept at 160 °C for 2 h with even stirring. After the designated
reaction time, the reactor was shifted out from the oil bath, quenching
the reaction with tap water. After dilution and centrifugation, the
supernatant was filtered through a Nylon 0.45 μm syringe filter
before analysis with Agilent 7890 B gas chromatography (GC).

4.5 Analysis Methods
Quantitative detection
of FA, 2-EMF, EL, and liquid products was performed using Agilent
7890 B GC and GC-MS (Agilent 6890-5973) similar to the previous method
reported by Liu and co-workers.44 Naphthalene
was chosen as the internal standard.
