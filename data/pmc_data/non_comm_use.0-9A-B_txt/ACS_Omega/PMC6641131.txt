The effects of exchange
current density, Tafel slope, system resistance,
electrode area, light intensity, and solar cell efficiency were systematically
decoupled at the converter-assisted photovoltaic–water electrolysis
system. This allows key determinants of overall efficiency to be identified.
On the basis of this model, 26.5% single-junction GaAs solar cell
was combined with a membrane-electrode-assembled electrolysis cell
(EC) using the dc/dc converting technology. As a result, we have achieved
a solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 20.6% on a prototype
scale and demonstrated light intensity tracking optimization to maintain
high efficiency. We believe that this study will provide design principles
for combining solar cells, ECs, and new catalysts and can be generalized
to other solar conversion chemical devices while minimizing their
power loss during the conversion of electrical energy into fuel.

Introduction
Splitting water into
hydrogen is a prominent pathway for solar
energy conversion and storage.1 The recent
development of converting excess electricity into hydrogen supports
the advent of the hydrogen economy.2 Additionally,
the hydrogen generated from solar water-splitting reaction shows the
possibility to meet the current hydrogen demand.3 Three different systems have been suggested
for using solar energy to convert water into hydrogen. These systems
are the photoelectrochemical electrode (PEC), photocatalyst, and photovoltaic–electrolysis
cell (PV–EC) systems. Although the state-of-the-art PEC and
photocatalyst have 10 and 5% solar-to-hydrogen conversion (STH) efficiency,
respectively, a much higher efficiency has been achieved with PV–EC
systems.4−15 The ease with which the PV–EC systems can be scaled up is
regarded to be a great advantage for industrial applications. This
superior efficiency can be realized by combining the following two
superior pre-existing infrastructures: efficient photovoltaics (PVs)
as the power generator and an electrolysis cell (EC) operated at low
overpotential for the hydrogen production.16−19 Moreover, the compact EC structure
fabrication with low electrolyte resistance and finely controlled
electrolyte flow for mass transfer limit preclusion are required to
maximize the efficiency of the overall system.

The primary requirement
for designing an efficient PV–EC
system for commercialization is highly efficient and stable photovoltaic
(PV) and electrolysis cell (EC) with low overpotential. In the case
of the EC system, adoption of efficient water-splitting catalysts
and proper cell configuration to minimize the solution resistance
and prevent the mass transfer limit at the solution/electrode interface
are needed. More importantly, an efficient combination of independent
PV and EC systems is also a critical issue for improving the STH efficiency
of the PV–EC system. For instance, to use the current close
to the short circuit current of PVs, Grätzel group used a NiFe
double hydroxide catalyst electrode that has a 16 times larger area
than the light-irradiation area on perovskite PVs (15.7% efficiency)
and achieved 12.3% STH efficiency, which is equivalent to 78.3% of
the PV maximum power.10 Nocera group highlighted the appropriate number
of series-connected Si PVs (16% PV efficiency) on the PV–EC
system by comparing the STH efficiency of systems based on three series-connected
PVs (2.8%) and four series-connected PVs (10%).20 Additionally, Fujii group varied the ratio of series-connected
ECs and PVs (31.2% of its efficiency) to achieve 24.4% STH efficiency,
by consuming 78.2% of the PV-driven maximum power for hydrogen conversion,
which is far more efficient than the same number of PVs and ECs connected
PV–EC system, with a 14.7% STH efficiency.21 Recently, by optimizing the electrode area of the EC, solar
light density, connection methodology, and temperature, Jaramillo
group achieved the highest ever STH efficiency (∼30%).22 Although the STH efficiency record has been
continuously broken by these pioneering works, it seems that general
guidelines to analyze the determinants of each subcompartment in the
PV–EC system do not exist. Therefore, further interface engineering
and optimization of each compartment can help design a record with
high STH-efficient systems.

Here, we conduct a systematic analysis
of the PV–EC system
to investigate the efficiency determinants by studying models and
performing experiments. The decoupled key parameters investigated
in our study included the following: (i) existence of a dc/dc converter,
(ii) catalyst overpotential, (iii) PV efficiency, (iv) Tafel slope,
(v) electrolyte resistance, (vi) surface by modeling, (vii) converter
efficiency, (viii) the number of series-connected PVs, and (ix) light
intensity. To validate the design principle that we suggested by both
modeling and experiments, we built converter-assisted PV–EC
(PV-Conv-EC) systems with an independently defined PV and EC. The
PV that we used was the record-high single-junction GaAs PV (26.5%)
fabricated by LG Electronics Inc., which was recently marked in the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) solar cell efficiency
chart. The superior efficiency of GaAs PVs is due to the rear junction
structure consisting of a top base (n-GaAs) layer
and a bottom emitter (p-Al0.3Ga0.7As) layer for minimizing carrier recombination. Additionally, fill
factors can be maximized in this structure because the band offset
caused by heterojunction between base and emitter layers can be further
decreased by the n-graded layer.23 The thickness of the n-graded layer was
optimized as 80 nm, which is the perfectly optimized distance for
minimizing valence band bending related to the high recombination
rate. Because the fabrication procedure can be used for all GaAs wafers
regardless of their size, the scalable and high-performing GaAs PVs
can be used as the power supply for designing our PV–EC system.
The EC system consisted of IrOx, Pt/C
nanocrystalline materials on carbon electrodes and membrane-electrode-assembled
(MEA) configuration with low electrolyte resistance. However, the
current analysis using these two catalysts can be generalized for
use with other cheap and earth-abundant catalysts. Note that the following
analyses were made by characterizing the parameters of catalysts such
as Tafel slope and overpotentional. On the basis of our design principle,
we finalized the PV–EC system composed of GaAs PVs, dc/dc converter,
and MEA EC. The EC electrode area used in this work was 6 cm2, and 40–120 mW of power can be stored as hydrogen energy
depending on the PV area (2–6 cm2). The maximum
STH efficiency that we achieved by controlling the subcompartments
was 20.6%, and 78% of the maximum PV-driven electricity was converted
into hydrogen energy. We believe that the new guideline and novel
analysis proposed in this work will open up new possibilities not
only for analyzing the efficiency of a PV–EC system but also
by providing insights into the way PV-Conv-EC systems can be implemented
regardless of the PV efficiency, PV and EC connection variation, or
catalysts.

Results and Discussion
Design Principle by Analysis in Terms of
Subcompartment Variables
of the PV-Conv-EC System
To decouple the determinants of
the efficiency of a PV–EC system, the model system with an
independent PV and EC governing the current density–voltage
(j–V) equation can be expressed
as follows 1   2  Equation 1 is the diode equation of PV materials consisting
of a short
circuit current density (jSC), dark current
density (j0), charge of electron (q), series resistance (Rs),
ideal diode factor (n), ideal gas constant (k), temperature (T), shunt resistance (Rsh), photogenerated voltage (VPV), and current density (jPV). Equation 2 is the
EC j–V relationship consisting
of thermodynamic water electrolysis potential (V0, 1.23 V at 298 K), Tafel slope of the cathode and the anode
(τcat and τano, respectively), exchange
current density of the cathode and the anode (j0,cat and j0,ano), solution resistance
(Rsol), applied voltage on EC (VEC), and current at EC (jEC). The EC electrode and light irradiance area to the PV are
regarded as the same unless otherwise stated. Moreover, in eq 2, the total overpotential
of the EC catalysts for reaching 10 mA cm–2 (η10mA) except for the solution resistance can be denoted as
follows 3  Because the standard potential difference
between water oxidation and reduction is 1.23 V, which is identical
to the Gibbs free energy content to form hydrogen and oxygen under
standard conditions, at least 1.23 V of open circuit voltage is necessary
to split water. However, considering that conventional single-junction
PVs such as Si (0.7 V) or GaAs (1.1 V) exhibits less open circuit
voltage than 1.23 V, multiple PVs should be series-connected to supply
enough potential.20,23 Therefore, we designed the model
system based on two series-connected PVs.

Before performing
the detailed calculation, parameters affecting the efficiency of a
PV–EC system can be predicted by a simplistic model. Because
conventional PV–EC system is composed of a direct electrical
connection between PV and EC, this situation can necessitate the current
density and voltage of PV and EC to be identical as follows: jPV = jEC and VPV = VEC. Therefore,
graphically, this necessity determines the operational state of the
PV–EC system as the intersection point of individual PV and
EC j–V curves (Figure 1a). For instance, the intersection
point can be obtained at 1.59 V of voltage and 15 mA of current from
two intersecting j–V curves,
a series-connected PV with a 29% efficiency and an EC with 300 mV
of η10mA, in Figure 1a. This point reflects the operating situation of the
modeled PV–EC system. From this point, the amount of power
that is stored as hydrogen (pH2) per square
centimeter and wasted as loss due to overpotential (pkin) per square centimeter can be estimated. pH2 can be expressed as the intersection current multiplied
by 1.23 V because chemical energy stored as hydrogen is identical
to the Gibbs free energy change (2H2 + O2 →
2H2O). Thus, considering that pH2 is proportional to the intersecting current, the intersection point
close to short circuit current of the PV indicates higher pH2. In this model, we thought that parasitic
current triggered by charging the electrodes, catalyst materials degradation,
or side reaction was negligible compared with water-splitting reaction.
Thus, we assume that the faradaic efficiency (ηF)
was 1, 18.5 mW cm–2 of pH2 was generated, and 5.3 mW cm–2 of pkin was wasted. However, the PV–EC operating power
(pH2 + pkin, 23.8 mW cm–2) is always lower than the maximum
power of PV (pPV,max, 29 mW cm–2), as shown in Figure 1a. The discrepancy between the pPV,max point and high pH2 point is due to the
current density–voltage coupling. If it is possible to make
the EC use pPV,max regardless of the intersection
current by decoupling the current–voltage of the PV and EC,
a higher pH2 can be achieved.

of the PV-Conv-EC system based on an independent
PV, the EC performance, and the existence of a converter. (a) Hydrogen
power per square centimeter (pH2) and
kinetic loss per square centimeter (pkin) at a given current density–voltage (j–V) curve of the PV and EC. The intersection between the
PV and EC j–V curve has a
lower voltage and a higher current density than the pPV,max point. (b) pH2 and pkin after the dc/dc converter assistance on

at each pPV,max and the overpotential

of the converter is also displayed. (d) pH2 of PV–EC and the PV-Conv-EC system depending on the EC performance
(Tafel slope and η10mA) at 30% PV efficiency.

To resolve the limitation of current
density–voltage coupling
between PV and EC, we propose a second model system that represents
the PV–EC system with a (i) dc/dc converter. PV-linked converter
application is a well-known method to help electrical power consumption
devices to use the maximum electrical power of PVs.24−26 Therefore,
the converter application allows pPV,max to be consumed on the EC by converting PV voltage and current density
at pPV,max point into voltage and current
density following the EC j–V relationship, called the “maximum power point tracking”
(MPPT). In this modeling, we assume that the converter efficiency
is 100%, indicating that the power generated by the solar cell can
be fully consumed by the EC without power loss. Comparison of the
MPPT process with the previous model is displayed in Figure 1b, which is equivalent to the
PV-Conv-EC system model assuming that no power loss occurs during
the converter application. Compared with pH2 in Figure 1a (18.5
mW cm–2), the MPPT process on the PV–EC system
shows higher pH2 gain (22 mW cm–2), indicating that 3.5 mW cm–2 of “extra pH2” can be additionally stored. Although
7 mW cm–2 of pkin still
exists even after using the converter, the total loss of the PV-Conv-EC
system is far lower than that of the converter-unassisted model, with
10.5 mW cm–2 of electrical power loss. Additionally,
the converter application can always ensure maximum power utilization
generated from the solar cell regardless of the light intensity, which
will be further discussed later.

To analytically investigate
the effect of the catalyst performance
on the PV-Conv-EC system, the amount of pH2 was determined along with the (ii) catalyst overpotential parameter
(η10mA) at (iii) various PV efficiencies. Figure 1c describes the pH2 gain by the PV-Conv-EC system with different
subcompartment applications; in this work, two η10mA (300 and 600 mV) and three PVs with different efficiencies (10,
20, and 30%) are selected as independent EC catalysts and PV performance
descriptors, respectively; especially, the 300 mV of η10mA can be almost achieved even with the transition-metal-based catalyst
materials such as NiCeOx water oxidation
and NiMo water reduction catalysts with 280 and 40 mV overpotential
reaching 10 mA cm–2, respectively.27,28 Solar cells with 10, 20, and 30% efficiency were modeled based on
the representative examples such as a series-connected organic solar
cell, perovskite solar cell, and GaAs solar cell, respectively.23,29,30 The j–V curves of PVs are shown in Figure S1. At each pH2 gain, the extra pH2 is denoted as the
check patterns in Figure 1c to indicate the amount of additional pH2 gain after the converter application on the PV–EC
system. Thus, the pH2 region except for
the extra pH2 is identical to the pH2 gain by the PV–EC system without the
converter application. Focusing that the pH2 with the PV–EC system without the converter is almost consistent
despite catalysts with different η10mA utilization,
the converter application is an indispensable factor to thoroughly
receive benefits of low overpotential catalysts. Taking into account
the importance of the converter application, we compare the pH2 gain of the PV-Conv-EC system at each independently
varied PV and EC performance parameters. The highest pH2 gain (23 mW cm–2) is observed for
the PV-Conv-EC system in combination with PV with the highest electrical
conversion efficiency (30%) and the lowest catalyst η10mA (300 mV). With the same PV utilization, however, the pH2 is only 19.4 mW cm–2 when a catalyst
with relatively higher η10mA (600 mV) was used. This
indicates that 3.6 mW cm–2 of additional pH2 can be achieved by improving the performance
of the catalysts. By contrast, in the case of 10% PV, only 1.3 mW
cm–2 of additional pH2 gain is achieved when lower overpotential catalysts are used. Considering
that the additional pH2 by catalyst utilization
with low overpotential at 30% PV is approximately threefold higher
than that with 10% PV, the dominance of catalyst overpotential becomes
more firmly established with highly efficient PV utilization by the
PV-Conv-EC system.

The pH2 variation
can be further extended
in terms of specific EC catalyst parameters such as the summation
of (iv) the Tafel slope of the catalysts (τcat +
τano) and η10mA based on eqs 2 and 3, as shown in Figure 1d. Although pH2 gains by both PV–EC
and PV-Conv-EC systems are highly dependent on η10mA, the pH2 profiles along the varied catalyst
η10mA are different. For instance, pH2 at PV–EC without the converter was almost constant
when η10mA is lower than 700 mV and started to decrease
abruptly when η10mA exceeded 700 mV. By contrast,
instead of an abrupt pH2 decrease, a gradual
decrease in pH2 is observed at the PV-Conv-EC
system. Furthermore, compared with the PV–EC system, pH2 of the PV-Conv-EC system is dependent more
on τcat + τano at a low η10mA. For instance, under a fixed η10mA (300
mV), consistent pH2 was kept at 18.5 mW
cm–2 with the PV–EC system without the converter
application. By contrast, 22.6 mW cm–2 of pH2 can be increased to 23 mW cm–2 when a catalyst with 90 mV dec–1 of τcat + τano was used instead of catalyst with
200 mV dec–1 at the PV-Conv-EC system. We also found
that the decrease in τcat + τano remarkably fosters pH2 to increase when
catalysts with lower η10mA are used. This is because
relatively small pH2 increase was observed
with a decrease in the Tafel slope at a high overpotential such as pH2 increased from 16.2 to 16.3 mW cm–2 when the τcat + τano was decreased
from 200 to 90 mV dec–1 at an η10mA of 1000 mV. Considering that pH2 increase
was more than 0.4 mW cm–2 because of the decrease
in the Tafel slope at 300 mV of η10mA, a relatively
small amount of additional pH2 (0.1 mW
cm–2) was obtained with the catalysts with 1000
mV of η10mA. This case study shows that the τcat + τano decrease can help the PV-Conv-EC
system to take advantage of high pH2,
particularly using catalysts with a low overpotential. From the results
shown in Figure 1c,d,
we can conclude that high pH2 (23 mW cm–2) gain is achieved with the catalysts with low τcat + τano (90 mV dec–1)
and η10mA (300 mV) parameters and that are identical
to 77% power of pPV,max (30 mW cm–2), far higher than 60% pPV,max to pH2 ratio with the conventional PV–EC
system.31

Even if efficient catalysts
with low overpotential and Tafel slopes
are used on the EC, (v) solution resistance of the EC can be affected
by the pH2 value based on the solution
resistance term in eq 2. Additionally, in a practical situation, it is possible to control
(vi) the EC to PV surface area ratio. This control can alter the current-related
constant such as the ratio among jSC, j0, j0,cat, and j0,ano, triggering pH2 to be varied in return. Figure S2 shows
the pH2 variation in terms of solution
resistance and AEC/APV ratio to analyze their dominancy. In real situations, many
variables related to the catalyst or solar cell will not exactly follow
the relationship that we verified in Figure S2. However, Figure S2 tells us that an efficient and a low-cost EC catalyst
should be used for the PV-Conv-EC system for effectively increasing pH2 instead of increasing the EC electrode surface
area. The low resistance and high AEC/APV configuration guarantee a higher pH2 gain with the PV-Conv-EC system in terms
of light-irradiation area on PVs. In this regard, MEA EC configuration
perfectly matched this requirement because of the thin membrane that
helps to minimize the electrolyte resistance and to control the EC
electrode area by simply preparing an optimal area of supporting electrodes
and membranes.

Scheme 1 indicates
the schematic of the PV-Conv-EC system composed of independent devices
to meet all requirements suggested from Figures 1 and S2. To be
specific, series-connected GaAs PV modules, buck-type dc/dc converter,
and MEA ECs are consecutively linked using wires. In addition to the
low resistance and feasibility to control the AEC/APV ratio, the MEA configuration
of the EC also warrants high purity of hydrogen and low resistance
because of the existence of thin proton exchange membrane.

circulated only at the anode compartment of the EC.

Improving Design Principle by Implementing the PV-Conv-EC System
For implementing the PV-Conv-EC system, we assembled the EC and
verified its performance in terms of parameters derived from catalyst
materials, system configuration, and product purity (Figure 2). To be specific, IrOx and Pt/C nanocrytallines were used as water
oxidation and reduction catalysts (Figure S3). On the basis of this catalytic property of materials, the Tafel
slope and overpotential of the catalytic material were analyzed by
converting the j–V curve
into an overpotential–log j curve (Figure 2a). We specify the
log j range of 0.9–1.3 to purely analyze the
water-splitting reaction of our catalysts without the charging effect.
The slope of the overpotential–log j curve
of each catalyst corresponds to the Tafel slope. Moreover, after combining
catalyst electrodes into an EC, the performance of EC can be overlaid
on the overpotential–log j slope after iR compensation process by resistance derived from Figure S4. The slope (98 mV dec–1) for increasing 1 order of current density at the EC was perfectly
consistent with the summation of the Tafel slope of the cathode (32
mV dec–1) and anode (66 mV dec–1) electrodes. Furthermore, the overpotential for reaching 10 mA cm–2 (300 mV) was also identical to the summation of the
cathode (30 mV) and anode (270 mV) overpotentials. Altogether, it
is valid that no parasitic current is generated after implementing
the EC with both catalyst materials. Seemingly, we can predict the
final pH2 with the given catalyst performance
thanks to the proposed design principle as suggested above.

Figure 2 Electrochemical
analysis of the electrode material and the MEA
EC. (a) Tafel slope of each cathode and anode and the MEA EC system.
The sum of the Tafel slope and the overpotential of each electrode
is similar to the MEA EC. (b) j–V curve of the MEA EC at different electrolyte resistances controlled
by the distance between the cathode and anode. The inset displays
the similarity of the j–V curve at each resistance after iR compensation.

To better achieve low resistance
on the EC, MEA configuration was
implemented with nanocrystalline catalyst decoration on its electrode.
In MEA cell with 6 cm2 of electrode area, proper distance
between electrodes should be used to minimize the electrolyte resistance
and product separation. Because the electrolyte resistance is in proportion
to the distance between the cathode and anode electrodes, distance
between the electrodes was controlled by Nafion thickness. The electrolyte
resistance decreased as the thin membrane was assembled (Figure S4b). Thus, the MEA EC with low resistance
guarantees higher current density at the same applied voltage (Figure 2b). Considering that
the j–V performance after
solution resistance compensation is similar regardless of the electrolyte
resistance, it is plausibly attributed to an identical catalytic performance
even under different electrode distances. Additionally, ηF was measured at each MEA EC (Figure S5). Regardless of the distance between electrodes in the EC, H2 faradaic efficiency (ηF) was almost 100%.
To be specific, the EC with 2.1 Ω cm2 of resistance
showed 99.6% of ηF, indicating that even the MEA
EC with the lowest electrolyte can guarantee pure hydrogen collection
without hydrogen crossover into the anode compartment. The minimal
amount of O2 (0.2% of produced H2 at 120 s)
at the cathode compartment also supports this. Instead, O2 existed in the anode chamber (ηF = 89%) of the
EC (Figure S6). Because an EC with the
lowest resistance guarantee purified H2 storage and ηF, we applied the EC with the lowest resistance to PV-Conv-EC
connection.

The electrical activity of the PV-Conv-EC system
can also be illustrated
as equivalent circuits (Figure 3a). Compared with conventional PV–EC system circuits,
which are identical to the combination of independent PV and EC circuits,
a converter between independent systems is the distinguished feature
of the PV-Conv-EC system circuit.32 The
resistance and capacitor at each EC electrode represent power consumption
due to the water-splitting reaction and the charging effect caused
by the electrodes. The PV circuit contains shunt and series resistance.
In the case of the converter circuit, the degree of switch (S1) on/off ratio, called the “duty ratio”, and
the inductor help the EC to use the maximum power of the solar cell
(pPV,max) regardless of the current–voltage
coupling. When S1 is off, S2 is automatically
turned on to operate its circuit. In our case, the buck-type converter
is used, and this helps decrease the voltage to be applied to the
EC compared with the voltage at the PV. Despite the decreased voltage
at the EC, the current on EC is far higher than the photogenerated
current in return. Additionally, based on the fact that the average
voltage gain at the power-consuming part is identical to the photogenerated
voltage, multiplying it with the duty ratio of the converter, theoretical
input duty ratio is determined to be VEC/VPV, where the power generated by the
PV at VPV and the power consumed by the
EC at VEC are equivalent.33 Altogether, to use the pPV,max at the EC compartment, the duty ratio for the MPPT process should
be predicted as VEC,MPPT/VPV,max, where VPV,max and VEC,MPPT indicate the pPV,max voltage and the voltage that was applied to the EC to
consume the pPV,max, respectively. In
addition, the converter circuit has complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor
(CMOS), it is unable to escape from power loss during the conversion
process. Power losses in CMOS circuits include the conduction loss caused
by the parasitic resistance and the switching loss attributed to the
switching operation of the metal oxide semiconductor field effect
transistors (MOSFETs).33 Thus, even with
the MPPT process, only ηconvpPV,max (ηconv < 1, ηconv = converter efficiency) of power is used by the EC to generate hydrogen.

at different PV illumination areas. (a) Diagram indicates circuit
of the PV-Conv-EC system. Maximum power of PV (pPV,max) can be provided to the EC with the optimum duty input
to the dc/dc converter, which is called MPPT. ηconvpPV,max is distributed to the pH2 and pkin. (b)

and hollow circle represent the pPV,max point and the point where the EC consumes pPV,max at each surface area of the PV. MPPT can be achieved
by inputting the theoretical duty (DT),
which is the ratio between the voltage of the EC that consumes pPV,max (VEC,MPPT) and the voltage at the pPV,max (VPV,max). (c) Current density and STH efficiency

duty (DO). The recovery of current density
after each chopping cycle indicates the stability of the system. (d)
Converter efficiency (ηconv) and (VEC/VPV) (1/D) at each input duty (D) under various APV conditions. The range of D was DO ± 0.02 to show the duty dependency near
the MPPT region. (e) Converter efficiency (ηconv)
and (VEC/VPV) (1/D) with a wide range of input duties (D) with APV = AEC = 6 cm2 configuration under 100 mW cm–2 light irradiance. The ηconv and
(VEC/VPV)
(1/D) values are almost consistent throughout the D range.

With the independent
PV and EC performance parameter, pH2 at
the implemented PV-Conv-EC system can be predicted
(Figure 3b). The I–V curve of the series-connected
GaAs PVs is shown in Figure S7. STH efficiency
can be derived from pH2 from overlaid
graphs by the following equation 4  Although the original
STH efficiency is expressed
in terms of hydrogen evolution rates (n) and its
free energy (236 000 J mol–1) divided by APV and light density (psol), the numerator of the equation can be converted into current
measured on the EC compartment (IEC),
1.23 V, and ηF at the EC. We assume that the converter
can transfer the full amount of the PV-generated power to the EC.
Through calculation, STH efficiencies can be estimated to be 21.5%
(17.52 mA cmPV–2), 20.9% (17.03 mA cmPV–2), and 20.6% (16.78 mA cmPV–2) when AEC/APV ratios were 3, 1.5, and 1, respectively.
As calculated in Figure 2d,0.996 of ηF was used for STH prediction. Additionally, based on the overlaid power (P)–V curve in Figure 3b, the theoretical duty for the MPPT (DT) as we mentioned previously was expected to be 0.84, 0.85,
and 0.87 at each configuration when AEC/APV ratios were 3, 1.5, and 1, respectively.
Without the converter application, only 18.4% STH efficiency can be
estimated because of the voltage–current coupling at all configurations.

By connecting the independent PV, converter, and EC, as shown in Scheme 1, we can generate
and collect hydrogen (Figure S8). In this
system, the STH efficiency can be converted from IEC measured by potentiostat as an ammeter (Figure 3c). In a practical situation,
the optimized input duty for MPPT (DO)
during the PV-Conv-EC operation was not identical to the DT predicted from Figure 3b. Therefore, an extra procedure for determining the DO for each configuration is necessary. The MPPT
process in the experiment was conducted by deciding whether pPV,max and measured power (IPV × VPV) at the PV compartment
were identical during the system operation. After the converter reached
the DO, the current was measured and converted
into STH efficiency, as derived from eq 4. The measured current densities per light-irradiated
area (converted STH efficiency from measured current on EC) were 16.81
mA cmPV–2 (20.6%), 15.96 mA cmPV–2 (19.6%), and 15.56 mA cmPV–2 (19.1%) when AEC/APV was 3, 1.5, and 1, respectively. STH efficiencies were lower
than the value driven from Figure 3b. The lower efficiency can be related to the converter
efficiency because the converter actually used a small amount of PV
power for its operation. Without the converter application, 18.4%
STH efficiency can be measured (Figure S9).

For an in-depth understanding of (vii) ηconv and
the discrepancy between DO and DT, we analyzed the converter efficiency with DO condition at the given AEC/APV configuration. At each DO, ηconv can be calculated
by dividing the electrical power consumed on the EC by photogenerated
PV power as follows 5  Because all used IEC, VEC at the EC and IPV and VPV at the PV can be
measured by a potentiostat and voltmeter, ηconv at
each configuration can be derived (Figure 3d). Interestingly, ηconv increased when higher AEC/APV EC configuration was used. For instance, approximately
95.9% ηconv can be achieved when AEC/APV was 3, which is far
higher than 92.8% ηconv when AEC/APV was 1.

Note that the
degree of consistency between DO and DT (DT/DO) in Figure 3b becomes larger with higher AEC/APV EC configuration. Moreover,
the values between ηconv and DT/DO are almost identical, indicating
a correlation between the two parameters. The correlation can be theoretically
derived from the following equation 6  The transformation of the IPV/IEC value into DO is based on our observation of equivalency
with two values (Table S1). The consistency
between IPV/IEC and DO can be attributed to the relatively
large inductance (1 mH) of our converter with an operation frequency
of 20 kHz, which significantly reduces the ripple current of the inductor
in the converter. Additionally, because VEC/VPV during the
MPPT process was identical to DT, ηconv and DT/DO values agreement can also be derived (Figure 3d). Despite controlling the input duty (D) so as not
to be identical to DO at each configuration,
equivalence between ηconv and (VEC/VPV) (1/D) was still maintained, indicating the validity of eq 6.

We also acknowledged that
ηconv becomes lower
as DO becomes higher. The high DO value is identical to the
technical situation where switch S1 in Figure 3a is mostly in the turn-on
position. Hence, this indicates that a longer time in the turn-on
position can severely reduce the conversion efficiency of our system.
To prove that ηconv is dependent on the input duty
ratio and not on the amount of PV-generated electrical power, we investigated
ηconv in terms of deliberately controlled input duty
ratio (D) at a fixed AEC/APV (=1) configuration and found that
ηconv increased with lower D (Figure 3e). This further
strengthens our claim that a small duty can actually increase the
converter efficiency. The ηconv in terms of D at a fixed AEC/APV configuration followed a similar trend as the ηconv in terms of DO in Figure 3d, indicating that
rather than the amount of PV-generated power, the duty ratio value
plays a huge role in the ηconv of our system. Therefore,
we can hypothesize that as the number of series-connected PV increases,
lower optimized duty will be necessary for the MPPT process and also
for the generation of high-converter efficiency.

To further
understand the converter efficiency and its operation
with various duties, we observed the operation of the PV-Conv-EC system
by varying (viii) the number of series-connected PVs. The DO for MPPT was completely different from two
series-connected PV systems. For instance, by series-connecting three
GaAs PVs, much lower DO is required compared
with a two series-connected PV configuration (Table 1). Interestingly, under PVs with three series-connected
configurations, dramatic improvement in the STH efficiency (19.5%)
can be achieved when AEC/APV = 1, compared with 12.2% STH efficiency without the
converter application (Figure S10c). The
ηconv of three series-connected PVs that used the
PV-Conv-EC system was higher than that of the two series-connected
PV system because of the lower DO required
for the MPPT process at AEC/APV = 1 configuration. Therefore, the number of series-connected
PVs plays a significant role in determining the ηconv of the converter MPPT process. Moreover, by using boost-type converter,
the system also allows MPPT of nonseries-connected PVs to operate
water electrolysis, although VOC is much
lower than 1.23 V as shown in Table 1. Despite the low ηconv with non-series-connected
PV, hydrogen can be generated where conventional PV–EC system
is not available (Figure S10d).

PV–EC system.

In
an identical PV and EC area, the PV-Conv-EC system can also
be used to various (ix) solar light power densities. By measuring
the I–V curve of the PV at
various light densities, the current and DT based on the VEC,MPPT/VPV,max ratio can be predicted as shown in Figure 4a. When the solar power densities
are 70 and 30 mW cm–2, the estimated current of
the EC at each light density divided solar cell area will be 11.97
(20.9% STH) and 5.09 mA cmPV–2 (20.8%
STH). Similar to that shown in Figure 3b, relatively lower power generated from the PV would
guarantee higher STH and lower DT for
MPPT (Figure 4a). By
measuring the IEC generated from different
light irradiance powers, the STH efficiency can be performed and the
duty can be optimized (Figure 4b). Interestingly, we found that MPPT can occur at each light
irradiance power for achieving the highest STH efficiency by the use
of pPV,max. Therefore, our system can
always use the maximum power of the PV at any time even though it
changes because of the light intensity. The STH efficiency at a small
light irradiance power was provided at both high STH and converter
efficiency. Current densities of 11.29 mA cmPV–2 (19.8% STH) and 4.92 mA cmPV–2 (20.1%
STH) can be achieved, respectively, at 70 and 30 mW cm–2 of light irradiance to PVs. The stability of our system was also
confirmed under the 30 mW cm–2 light condition (Figure 4c). These show the
possibility that our system can truly achieve the maximum STH even
with the varying intensity of solar light through the combination
of an automatic perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm. Moreover, if we can obtain spectra on each solar light intensity,
it would be possible to firmly analyze the relationship between the
STH efficiency and solar light intensity based on light absorption
and conversion prediction of our GaAs PVs as the Deutsch group suggested
and the modeling we did on Figure 1.34 It will further improve
the robustness of our design principle so that our system has more
industrial applications.

Conclusions
The advantage of this
approach is that the decoupled factors in
terms of PV and EC variables can be investigated to determine how
they can affect the final efficiency of a PV–EC system. Our
findings provide new insights into the selection of independent PV
and EC compartments for achieving the desired efficiency of a solar-driven
hydrogen evolution reaction. The individual compartment-dependency
and the interface optimization presented here highlight the selection
of an EC catalyst and the optimized configuration that derives the
highly efficient photoelectrolysis hydrogen evolution, minimizing
the loss. Through the optimization modeling and experiments, the importance
of EC performance especially with highly efficient PVs, converter
existence, and optimized number of series-connected PVs are indispensable
for a high STH-efficiency PV-Conv-EC system. As a result, 20.6% STH
efficiency and 78% PV electricity-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency
can be achieved. Even if the rare metal electrocatalysts were used
for this work, we definitely believe that state-of-the-art earth-abundant
catalysts can be also used to our design principle because of their
superior characteristics.27 This PV-Conv-EC
system design rule can help advance the commercialization of solar-driven
hydrogen fuels for a future clean-energy society.

Methods
Model Study
From the analysis of Figure 1c, the fixed parameters of eqs 2 and 3 were
calculated as follows: τcat = 30 mV dec–1, τano = 60 mV dec–1, I0,cat = 1 mA, and Rsol = 1 Ω cm2. The τcat, τano, and I0,cat values correspond
to the Tafel mechanism of hydrogen evolution, the one-proton-one-electron-involved
water oxidation mechanism, and the exchange current of platinum for
hydrogen evolution, respectively.35,36 In Figure 1d, the variation
in the τcat + τano and η10mA values were brought about by the anode performance under
a fixed cathode performance condition (cathode exchange current =
1 mA and Tafel slope = 30 mV dec–1). The PV used
in this figure was with 30% efficiency, as shown in Figure S1. The resistance was also fixed, Rsol = 1 Ω cm2, as in Figure 1c,d. In Figure S2, the anode performance was fixed as the anode exchange
current density = 10–3.5 mA cm–2 and the Tafel slope = 60 mV dec–1. The cathode
performance was fixed as cathode exchange current = 1 mA cm–2 and the Tafel slope = 30 mV dec–1. The PV used
in this figure was with 30% efficiency, similar to the efficiency
outlined in Figure S1. We assume that the
temperature was maintained at room temperature in the modeled solar
cell or PV-Conv-EC system.

Fabrication of the Solar Cell
The
GaAs solar cell was
fabricated by the following process. First, the device layer was deposited
on the GaAs wafer by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD)
in the following order: trimethylgallium (TMGa), arsine (AsH3), trimethylaluminum (TMAl), phosphine (PH3), and trimethylindium
(TMIn). Next, by using the e-beam evaporator, the front and back of
the gold electrode were deposited. The front layer was additionally
electroplated for decreasing the resistance with the optimized grid
structure. To control the surface area, the mesa-etching process was
conducted. To be specific, the cell with a designated area (1 cm2 in this case) was covered with a photoresist and etched with
solution. After the etching is completed, the photoresist was peeled
off. After cutting the cell into the desired form, the cell was bonded
on a printed circuit board (PCB) substrate, and the front electrode
was wired with the substrate. Finally, for the antireflective coating,
the ZnS and MgF2 layers were thermally evaporated and deposited
on the solar cell with optimized thickness (∼50 and ∼100
nm for ZnS and MgF2, respectively).

Synthesis of Electrode
The metal oxide nanocrystalline
was synthesized using the hot injection method. After washing the
nanocrystalline with toluene and acetone, 20 mg of the synthesized
nanocrystalline was annealed under 250 °C for 1 h for removing
organic ligands. The annealed nanocrystalline was dispersed in 50
mL of 1 mg ml–1 K2IrCl6 (STREM,
99%) and heated at 60 °C for 6 h under continuous stirring. The
powder was washed with water and ethanol. After washing, annealing
was conducted under 250 °C for 1 h. After the annealing procedure,
1.2 mg of IrOx powder was dispersed in
120 μL of ethanol and 9 μL of Nafion 117 solution (Aldrich,
∼5 wt % mixture of alcohol and water). A drop of ink was placed
on 6 cm2 carbon fiber paper (FuelCellStore, Spectracarb
2050A-0850) and dried under ambient condition for 1 day. The cathode
was prepared with 1.2 mg of 20 wt % Pt/C (Alfa) and dispersed in 120
μL of ethanol and 9 μL of Nafion 117 solution. A drop
of ink was placed on 6 cm2 carbon fiber paper and dried
under ambient air for 1 day.

Converter Designing
To implement
the converter, the
FR-4 PCB was designed on the breadboard with appropriate devices.
The switches of the converter (S1 and S2) were
both implemented by MOSFET (IRF 540). The 1 mH ferrite core inductor,
SRR 1208-102KL, was used as the inductor. The appropriate duty cycle
control was exercised with the digital signal processor TMS320C28346
from Texas Instruments. The switching frequency was 20 kHz.

Material
Characterization
The IrOx nanocrystalline
was analyzed using a transmission electron
microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F). The Pt/C nanocrystalline was measured
using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, SIGMA).

MEA Cell Construction
The configuration of the cell
is shown in Scheme 1. The Nafion membrane was washed under boiling 3 wt % H2O2 for 1 h, boiling 1 mol L–1 H2SO4 for 1 h, and boiling deionized water for 1
h before each assembly procedure. The interface between the graphite
bipolar plate and the Nafion membrane was joined with a silicon (∼0.2
mm) gasket with both the cathode and anode sites. The cell was sealed
with torque of a 75 kgf cm at each screw driver. The carbon fiber
paper electrode area was fixed at 6 cm2 for each cathode
and anode.

Electrochemistry
Electrochemical
measurements were
recorded using a potentiostat (CHI 760E, CH Instruments). For three
electrochemical measurements, a Pt foil (3 × 3 × 0.01 cm,
99.997% purity, Alfa) was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl
electrode (BASi, 3 M NaCl) was used as a reference electrode. In the
case of 3 electrode system, 0.5 cm2 of catalyst electrode
performance was measured. The working electrode was prepared by following
the procedure similar to the previous drop-cast carbon fiber paper.
The scan rate was 10 mV/s. The catalyst property was shown after polarization
between the forward and reverse CV scan current and further iR compensation using V = Vapplied – iR.

The electrochemical
potentials were converted into the RHE scale by the following equation  For the two-electrode electrochemical measurements,
the counter and reference electrodes were connected to the cathode
compartment of the MEA cell and the working electrode was connected
to the anode compartment. The electrolyte was prepared with 0.1 mol
L–1 HClO4 for both the three and two
electrochemical measurements. The current detection during the photovoltaic-based
electrolysis was measured by the same potentiostat connected to the
ammeter. The voltage during photoelectrolysis was measured based on
the converter voltage measurement.

Gas Measurement
Gas quantification was performed using
gas chromatography (GC). The hydrogen evolution compartment of the
MEA cell was connected and hermetically sealed in a glass flask. Before
electrolysis, Ar gas was purged for 15 min to eliminate the gas content.
After sealing of the gas, bulk electrolysis was started under 1.6
V until a charge was accumulated. For each given charge, 1 mL of gas
was collected using a gas-tight syringe and injected into a gas chromatography
instrument (NARL8502 model 4003, PerkinElmer). The oxygen evolution
was analyzed using a fluorescence-based oxygen probe (NEOFOX-KIT-PROBE,
Ocean Optics). A similar procedure for the
detection of H2 evolution was performed: the MEA cell anode
compartment was tightly linked with a glass flask containing an electrolyte.
After purging with Ar for 15 min, bulk electrolysis was conducted
under 1.6 V while the oxygen probe detected the oxygen in the glass
flask.

Solar Cell IV Curve Measurement
For a single GaAs PV,
the current–voltage performance was measured by applying external
potential by an I–V test
system (K3000, MsScience). The solar simulator (K3000, MsScience,
class AAA) was used to irradiate the standard light condition on the
GaAs PV and PV-conv-EC system under the AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm–2) condition or a specific solar power density condition. During the
PV performance measurement or PV-Conv-EC system operation, the PVs
are always cooled with a fan for maintaining consistent room temperature.
The PV area was controlled by a combination of 1 cm2 of
monolithic GaAs PV. The light intensity variation was measured using
an optical power meter (Newport, model 1916-R).
