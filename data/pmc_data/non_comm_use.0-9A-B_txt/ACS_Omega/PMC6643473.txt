We herein report for the first time
an unusual decomposition of
2-nitrophenyl-substituted N-formyl pyrazolines under
Bechamp reduction condition employed to yield 2-aryl quinolines exclusively
instead of pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolines. The reaction
investigation suggests acid-mediated cleavage of 1 followed
by a retro-Michael addition, and a subsequent in situ intramolecular
reductive cyclization through a modified Friedlander mechanism afforded
2-aryl quinolines (2) in good yields. The proposed mechanistic
pathways were supported via experimental evidence and density functional
theory studies. B3LYP/6-31+G(d) analysis indicated the involvement
of trans-2-hydroxyaminochalcone as a key intermediate and its isomerization
and cyclization, leading to unusual product formation.

==== Body
Introduction
2-Pyrazoline and its
derivatives such as N-alkanoyl/aroylpyrazolines
find wide applications1 as medicinal agents,2 possess optical properties,3 act as chemosensors in bioimaging,4 and serve as synthetic intermediates.5 A few literature reports are available on decomposition of 1-pyrazoline6 (a) under thermal and photochemical
conditions, which leads to the formation of (Scheme 1i) cyclopropane (c) via 1,3-biradical6a (b) and the formation and extrusion
of nitrogen gas (Scheme 1ii).6b Bicyclic divinyl-1-pyrazoline (d) underwent ring cleavage under similar conditions into a
mixture of products (e–g) via a common
diradical intermediate (Scheme 1iii).7 Thermal decomposition of
spiro-1-pyrazolines (h) afforded S-methylbenxylidenes
(i and j) and spiro-cyclopropanes (k and l) (Scheme 1iv).8 Although 2-pyrazoline
unlike its isomer 1-pyrazoline is quite stable, it has been found
to undergo ring cleavage under thermal condition, e.g., decomposition
(Scheme 1v) of 3-aroyl-4-aryl-2-pyrazolines
(m) yielded 3-alkylchalcone (n) along with
the formation of cyclopropane (c).9

Scheme 1 Reported Literature on Ring Cleavage of Pyrazolines
Recently, we have reported
the one-pot synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline 3 by reductive cyclocondensation
of 2-nitrophenyl-substituted N-formyl pyrazolines
(1) under basic conditions10 (Scheme 2). To the
best of our knowledge, metal-promoted ring cleavage of N-formyl-2-pyrazolines under acidic condition is not previously described.
We herein for the first time disclose iron-catalyzed, acid-mediated
cleavage of N-formyl pyrazolines leading to the synthesis
of 2-aryl quinolines via retro-Michael addition and subsequent in
situ reductive cyclocondensation via the modified Friedlander mechanism
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthetic
Route of 2-Aryl Quinolines (2) and Previous
Reported Work for the Synthesis of Pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline (3)
Results and Discussion
As metals under acidic conditions
are very frequently employed
to reduce the aromatic nitro group,11 we
selected 1a as the model substrate (Scheme 3) and carried out the reaction
in MeOH at reflux for 2 h under Bechamp reduction condition12 involving Fe (3 equiv)/HCl (0.5 equiv). To our
surprise, the reaction ended with the synthesis of 2-aryl quinoline
as major product (isolated yield of 2a: 91%). Further
to get better insight into metal and acidic conditions under Bechamp
conditions, we treated 1a with permutation and combination
of various metals and Brønsted acids (Fe, Sn, Zn, Pd in HCl,
H2SO4, CH3COOH, trifluroacetic acid
(TFA)) under different reaction conditions, such as dichloromethane,
dichloroethane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, MeOH, and MeCN at room temperature
(rt) or under reflux (see Table S1). Interestingly,
neither intramolecular Friedel–Crafts acylated product13 (4a) (in TFA with or without metal)
nor pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazoline (3a)10,14 (except in Pd/CH3COOH; 5%) was obtained. All of the reactions
yielded 2a as major component. The best results in terms
of yield and cleanliness (less to no side products) were obtained
under Bechamp conditions.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of 2a under Various
Conditions
To further reconnoiter
and prove the generality of this unexpected
synthesis, we performed reaction with a variety of 2-nitrophenyl-substituted N-formyl pyrazolines having various groups at the aromatic
ring(s) and were treated under optimized conditions that yielded 2-aryl
quinolines in good yields (Table 1). The reaction progression was observed to be influenced
by the electronic nature of the ring substituents. Heteroaromatic
rings like pyridine and thiophene (entries 13–16) were tolerant
to reaction conditions. The dinitro-substituted substrate 1k yielded 2k exclusively (entry 11).

Table 1 Scope of Reaction for the Synthesis
of 2-Aryl Quinolines (2a−2p)
a Isolated yield.

We conducted few control experiments
to understand the sequential
steps and possible intermediates involved in the mechanism of formation
of 2 from 1 (Scheme 4). Treatment of 1a with acid
at rt led to cleavage of N-formyl group (5), which on addition of metal yielded 2-nitrochalcone 6 as major product through retro-Michael addition along with some
minor products: 2-nitrophenyl pyrazole 7 and 2-aminophenyl
pyrazole 8. The formation of 2-pyrazoline 5 indicates that the reaction does not undergo oxidative deformylation.15 Likewise, in another example, liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis of reaction mixture containing 1h and Fe/HCl for 30 min showed the presence of the corresponding
deformylated pyrazoline, 2-nitrochalcones, and 2-aryl quinolines (see Scheme S1, Figure S1, and Table S2). A single
case on such ring cleavage of 2-pyrazoline leading to an α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compound is reported to produce nitrogen gas by treating
2-pyrazoline with benzeneseleninic anhydride.5 Further refluxing of 6 in MeOH under Bechamp reduction
condition afforded 2a in quantitative yield (88%) via
proposed intermediate trans-2-hydroxyaminochalcone169, which we could not isolate (Scheme 4A). However, we obtained 10 and 11, the corresponding trans-2-aminochalcones17 of 1e and 1c, when refluxed for 30 min under Fe/HCl condition along
with 2-aryl quinolines (Scheme 4B). No chlorination12b was observed
in the aromatic ring under Bechamp reduction condition.

Scheme 4 (A) Control
Experiments Conducted Using 1a; (B) Control
Experiments Conducted Using 1c and 1e
From these observations, we
envisage that N-deformylation takes
place in the first step of the reaction.18 To explore this further, an independent experiment was set up, where
an equimolar mixture of 1a and aniline was refluxed under
Bechamp reduction in MeOH to yield formanilide along with 2a (Scheme 5). The formation
of formanilide could be justified by the reaction of aniline with
in situ generated methyl formate as the rate of reaction was low when
the reaction was carried out without methanol. Interestingly, the
reaction was found to be general in case of N-acetylpyrazolines,
leading to 2-aryl quinolines but not with N-phenylpyrazoline,
where a mixture was obtained, which could not be separated (see Schemes S2 and S3). The second step involves
retro-Michael addition, which is generally catalyzed by Lewis/Brønsted
acids, and in the present case, it is facilitated by Lewis acid (Fe2+)12b as no 6 was
formed until metal was added. In the third step, reductive cyclization
of trans-2-nitrochalcone involving a facile isomerization
of double bond of 9(16,17,19) takes place to yield 2-aryl quinoline in a manner
not exactly similar to the Friedlander synthesis of quinolines.20

Scheme 5 Reaction of 1a with Aniline
under Bechamp Reduction
and the Proposed Mechanism
The pathways of this step were explicated by using the
B3LYP/6-31+G(d)
level of quantum chemical analysis (Scheme 6). This reaction may involve three steps.
In the first step, 9 can undergo 1,5-Hshift (endergonic
by 8.2 kcal/mol) to give a tautomer 12. Tautomer 12 from tautomer 9 can either be obtained through
a neutral pathway, in which the activation barrier for 1,5-Hshift
was estimated to be 39 kcal/mol, or involve 1,5-Hshift via radical
cation of 9 having an activation barrier of 22.36 kcal/mol
(see Scheme S4A,B). Tautomer 12 has a C–C single bond about which rotation is comparatively
easier to give the isomer 13. During the cyclization
(step c) of 13, simultaneous proton transfer from OH
to carbonyl oxygen and nucleophilic attack of nitrogen on the electrophilic
carbonyl carbon takes place, leading to C–N bond formation
(TS; activation energy required, 24.77 kcal/mol). The
cyclization step gives rise to an intermediate 14, which
is found to be exergonic by 23.8 kcal/mol. The available reaction
conditions allow 14 to give the final product 2a. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also suggested that
isomerization and intramolecular cyclization of trans-2-aminochalcone are difficult due to the high activation energy barrier
(see Figure S2, path B); however, it is
possible under blue light-emitting diode.19 This was further evidenced when no corresponding 2-aryl quinoline
was formed even after refluxing 10 or 11 under Bechamp reduction condition for 12 h. The characterization
of final synthetics was carried out using mp, IR, NMR, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) techniques.

barrier for the reaction
is 24.77 kcal/mol, and the energy released is 21.29 kcal/mol in path

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have
studied an unreported breakdown of 2-nitrophenyl
substituted N-formyl pyrazolines under the influence
of Bechamp reduction condition that yielded 2-aryl quinolines exclusively
instead of pyrazolo[1,5-c]quinazolines or Friedel–Crafts
acylated product. The acid and metal played role in deformylation,
retro-Michael addition, and intramolecular reductive cyclization in
a modified Friedlander manner to afford 2-aryl quinolines. The proposed
mechanistic pathways are supported by experimental evidences and density
functional theory (DFT) studies. Quinolines are reported to find a
wide variety of applications as antimalarial,21 anticancer,22 antitubercular,23 and anti-inflammatory substances24 and act as a precursor for C–H activation.25 Therefore, a straightforward and easy synthetic
route for quinoline is still warranted.

Experimental Section
General
Materials and Methods
The reagents of AR/GR
quality for synthesis were procured from Sigma-Aldrich, Sisco Research
Laboratory, Loba-Chemie Pvt. Ltd., India, and were not further refined
for purification. For weighing purpose, a Sartorius analytical balance
(BSA224S-CW) was used. Heating was done using a JSGW heating mantle.
Solvent was concentrated using an ILMVAC rotary evaporator. Monitoring
of reaction progress was done using thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
(precoated Merck TLC plates) using gradient concentration of hexane/ethyl
acetate or chloroform/methanol as the mobile phase, and detection
was performed in the UV/fluorescent analysis cabinet. Stuart melting
point apparatus (SMP-30) was used for analyzing the melting points
of final synthetics, and a Bruker Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer
was used for obtaining the IR spectra of compounds. NMR and HRMS images
were outsourced and recorded at SAIF, Panjab University, Chandigarh,
and IIT Ropar, Punjab, respectively, in using CDCl3/dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 as solvent on 400
MHz (1H) and 100 MHz (13C) Bruker Avance NMR
spectrometers.26

Illustrative Methodology
for Synthesis of N-Formyl Pyrazolines (1a–p)
In a 100 mL round-bottom
flask, a mixture of an appropriate chalcone (1 mmol), formic acid (1.5
mmol), and hydrazine hydrate (80%, 1.5 mmol) was added. The mixture
was further subjected under refluxing conditions for 1–4 h.
After the completion of reaction as indicated by TLC, cold water was
added to the reaction mixture, which resulted in the formation of
precipitates. The precipitates were washed thoroughly with excess
water and dried before crystallization using ethyl acetate to obtain
the pure product.

General Procedure for Synthesis of 2a–p
For
the synthesis of appropriate N-substituted quinolines (2a–p), respective formylated pyrazolines
(1a–p) were refluxed in MeOH for
1–4 h, using catalyst Fe (3 equiv) and HCl (40%, 0.5 equiv).
The reaction progress was monitored by TLC. After completion of the
reaction, the mixture was passed through celite under pressure to
remove Fe. Methanol was further concentrated using a rotary evaporator
to obtain a solid crude. The crude was then neutralized with a bicarbonate
solution and extracted using ethyl acetate (10 mL × 3). The ethyl
acetate layer was further washed with brine solution, moisture-removed
by passing it over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated using
a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to obtain the crude product.
The crude purification was carried out by flash chromatography (silica
gel # 60–120; petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 60:40).

2017 , 15 , 6349 –6352 . 10.1039/C7OB00558J .28703245 b Note: The
estimated barrier for cis–trans isomerization of nitro radical
anion was calculated to be 37 kcal/mol, which was 5 kcal/mol less
than that of cis–trans isomerization observed in Path B thus
supporting the path A (see Supporting Information, Scheme S5).
