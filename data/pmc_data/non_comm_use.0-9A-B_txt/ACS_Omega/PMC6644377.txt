Endohedral
metallofullerenes (EMFs) have great potential as radioisotope
carriers for nuclear medicine and as contrast agents for X-ray and
magnetic resonance imaging. EMFs have still important restrictions
for their use due to low solubility in physiological environments,
low biocompatibility, nonspecific cellular uptake, and a strong dependence
of their peculiar properties on physiological parameters, such as
pH and salt content. Conjugation of the EMFs with proteins can overcome
many of these limitations. Here we investigated the thermodynamics
of binding of a model EMF (Gd@C60) with a protein (lysozyme)
that is known to act as a host for the empty fullerene. As a rule,
even if the shape of an EMF is exactly the same as that of the related
fullerene, the interactions with a protein are significantly different.
The estimated interaction energy (ΔGbinding) between Gd@C60 and lysozyme is −18.7 kcal mol–1, suggesting the possibility of using proteins as
supramolecular carriers for EMFs. π–π stacking,
hydrophobic interactions, surfactant-like interactions, and electrostatic
interactions govern the formation of the hybrid between Gd@C60 and lysozyme. The comparison of the energy contributions to the
binding between C60 or Gd@C60 and lysozyme suggests
that, although shape complementarity remains the driving force of
the binding, the presence of electron transfer from the gadolinium
atom to the carbon cage induces a charge distribution on the fullerene
cage that strongly affects its interaction with the protein.

Introduction
Fullerenes are spherical molecules made
only of carbon atoms. Atoms
and molecular clusters can be encapsulated inside fullerenes to form
endohedral fullerenes.1 The encapsulation
of metal atoms creates a new class of hybrid molecules, which are
called endohedral metallofullerenes (EMFs).1−5 The physico-chemical properties of these hybrid materials
differ from those of empty fullerenes because of the presence of electron
transfer from the metal atoms to the carbon cage.1−5 The number of atoms encapsulated inside the cage
defines the type of EMFs that can labeled mono-EMFs,1−5 di-EMFs,1−5 tri-EMFs,1−6 and cluster-EMFs.1−8

EMFs can find applications in a variety of fields that span
molecular
electronics, photovoltaics, materials science, and nanomedicine.1 A further interesting potential application is
the exploitation of EMFs as contrast agents (CAs) for magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and X-ray imaging as well as radioisotope carriers in
nuclear medicine.9−14 Many metal ions that have found application in medicine15 are toxic and cannot be administered safely
in vivo. Chelating agents are often used to coordinate the metal ions
and reduce their toxicity.16 However, in
vivo, these chelate complexes are prone to metal dissociation.17 The release of free metal is impossible when
using EMFs. EMFs therefore provide a truly unique alternative to chelating
compounds because of their resistance to metabolism and their high
kinetic stability. Thus, incarceration of atoms inside fullerene cages
prevents direct binding of the toxic metal ions with serum components
and tissues. A class of EMFs very promising for applications as MRI
contrast agents (CAs) is represented by gadofullerenes.18−27

Gadofullerenes are paramagnetic compounds that entrap Gd3+ ions. They offer fundamental advantages over conventional
chelate-based
MRI CAs. The aquated Gd3+ ion is toxic,17 and its toxicity is usually sequestered by chelation with
multidentate ligands.16 Both linear and
macrocyclic chelating ligands were exploited, and several compounds
are now available.16 However, even the
best-designed chelates are characterized by some thermodynamic instability
and the associated metabolic-ion release. A possible risk associated
with the administration of these contrast agent is the acute nephrotoxicity.17 In particular, nephropatic patients could develop
nephrogenic systemic fibrosis after exposure to gadolinium, a potentially
fatal disease.17

The encapsulation
of metals inside the fullerene cages cannot be
considered as a chelation, i.e., a coordinative, dative bonding. The
Gd3+ metal ion is trapped inside the biologically stable
fullerene cage,1 so that the toxic Gd3+ ion is never released in vivo. This obvious advantage of
gadofullerene structures is especially important for CAs that require
longer retention times in vivo, such as those for blood-pool imaging.
Gadofullerene species have recently been shown to exhibit T1 relaxivity up to 500 times greater27 than those of CAs presently in clinical use.
These new nanoscale materials are the highest performing MRI CA known
to date. The carbon cage itself plays an important role in the large
value of the relaxivity of the gadofullerenes. In the relaxation process,
the gadofullerene can simultaneously relax the protons of many hydrogen-bonded
water molecules on their ∼200 Å2 paramagnetic
surface.21 The increased contrast and stable
encapsulation of Gd3+ potentially offer the possibility
of using lower dosages of more potent and safer paramagnetic contrast
agents, as compared with the performance of clinically used Gd chelates.

Although gadofullerenes overcome much of the limitations of current
CAs, demonstrating superior relaxivity properties and no Gd3+ release, they still present important restrictions in their use:(i) low biocompatibility,

(ii) difficulty to direct
or target the
gadofullerenes to specific cells or tissues,

(iii) proton relaxivities that display
a remarkable pH dependency,24

(iv) fullerene-based materials show aggregation
phenomena that depend on the salt content of the medium and, therefore,
affect their behavior in biological or medical applications,25

(v) short retention times.



Conjugation of
EMFs with proteins can overcome most, or all, of
these limitations. The ability of fullerenes to interact with proteins
was demonstrated in many systems, both experimentally28−43 and computationally.43−53 A few noteworthy advantages of protein EMF bioconjugates are(a) a EMF-bioconjugate
can be perfectly
biocompatible;54

(b) the relaxivity will not depend on
pH or salt concentration, since the EMF-bioconjugate does not aggregate;28

(c) specific tissue targeting becomes
possible with binding to specific proteins or antibodies.55−57



Crucially, conjugation of a paramagnetic
gadofullerene and a protein
can improve relaxivity, since the interaction with proteins can slow
down the molecular rotation of the EMF and result in a relaxivity
increase.58 In the past, molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations have been carried out to investigate the interactions
between gadofullerenol and proteins.59−61 The aim of this work
is to investigate the possibility of conjugating pristine EMFs with
proteins in a noncovalent way. Gd@C60–lysozyme was
chosen as a representative case because it is possible to make a comparison
with the C60–lysozyme system, which has been well
investigated both experimentally and computationally.28,30,51,52,54 The analysis of the energy contributions
of the binding between Gd@C60 and lysozyme also supplies
guidelines for understanding protein–EMF interactions.

Results
and Discussion
Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations
on Gd@C60 Molecules
Due to the lack of crystallographic
structures
for Gd@C60, to find the most stable state and geometry
of Gd@C60, the Gd ion was systematically inserted into
the crystallographic structure of C60 in different positions
inside the cage, and a series of geometry optimization calculations
were carried out, using different multiplicities. In agreement with
previous calculations,62 it was found that
the Gd ion is placed close to one of the hexagonal faces of the C60 cage. The total spin multiplicity of Gd@C60 is S = 7. ESP charges were calculated for the most stable structure
of Gd@C60 according to Merz–Kollman
(MK) scheme (Figure 1).

Docking Gd@C60 to Lysozyme
The docking procedure
provides 27 privileged positions of Gd@C60 interacting
with lysozyme (Figure 2a). To rank the different poses, the molecular mechanics-generalized
born surface area (MM-GBSA) value of the interaction63 between Gd@C60 and lysozyme, in the minimized
structures, was used as a scoring function. The position that maximizes
the interaction of Gd@C60 (Figure 2b) provides
the initial coordinates for a 200 ns MD simulation of the adduct in
an explicit water box.

To estimate the binding energy between lysozyme
and Gd@C60 and their components,
we carried
out a MM-GBSA analysis of the trajectory. This methodology has provided
valuable information to estimate the interaction between proteins
and carbon nanomaterials.64−68

Gd@C60 Binding Pocket
The interaction energy
(ΔGbinding) between Gd@C60 and lysozyme, in the Gd@C60 most favorite binding pocket,
was evaluated to be −18.7 kcal mol–1, a value
very close to the C60–lysozyme interaction (−18.5
kcal mol–1).51 Experimentally,
lysozyme was used as a supramolecular host for C60.28,30,54 These results indicate the feasibility
of the noncovalent bioconjugation of EMFs with proteins. Analysis
of the binding components of the energy (Figure 3) shows that, even if the Gd@C60 is highly charged, van der Waals interactions remain the driving
force for the binding (−41.1 kcal mol–1).

Figure 3 Energy
components of ΔGbinding of Gd@C60 with lysozyme in the most favorite binding
site.

Electrostatic interactions account
for only −3.0 kcal mol–1. In the Gd@C60, the electron transfer
due to the presence of the Gd ion inside the cage induces, at the
same time, positive and negative charges on the fullerene cage, generating
a plethora of stabilizing and destabilizing terms that counterbalance
each other. The fact that Gd@C60 maintains its hydrophobic
character is proved by the negative value of the hydrophobic interactions,
i.e., nonpolar solvation, that assist the binding (−3.7 kcal
mol–1). This value is smaller than that of the vdW
interactions. Polar solvation (12.6 kcal mol–1)
and entropy contribution (16.5 kcal mol–1) are detrimental
to the binding, since their contributions are positive. The per-residue
decomposition of ΔGbinding helps
in understanding the chemical origin of the various contributions.

Proteins are able to establish a large number of interactions with
carbon nanoparticles that include π–π stacking,
hydrophobic interactions, surfactant-like interactions, and electrostatic
interactions.69−73Table 1 shows that
a variety of interactions are present in the protein–EMF adduct.
π–π stacking between aromatic residues and the
conjugated surface of carbon nanomaterials usually governs their interaction.69−74 For Gd@C60, π-stacking contacts between the cage
and the indolic group of Trp 123 (sandwich-like) and the phenyl group
of Phe 34 (T-shaped) are important stabilizing terms (Figure 4a).

Hydrophobic interactions are established between aliphatic residues
and the Gd@C60 surface. Amino acids with a hydrophobic
side chain tend to bind to the surface of Gd@C60, reducing the interfacial energy with the
water interface (hydrophobic effect).69 Usually, the interaction energy increases with an increase in the
exposed hydrophobic surface of the protein residue.69 In the present case, the longer aliphatic chain of Val
120 interacts more strongly with the Gd@C60 than Ala 122
(Figure 4b). The interactions
of Cys 30 and Cys 115 with Gd@C60 deserve special attention.
These residues form a disulfide bond that interacts directly with Gd@C60 (Figure 4b). The importance of this kind of interaction
was recently highlighted by Hirano and co-workers for lysozyme and
carbon nanotubes.75,76

Our computations evidenced
surfactant-like interactions between
the Thr 118 and Lys 33 residues and Gd@C60 (Figure 4c).69,77,78 The hydrophobic aliphatic chains of these
residues interact with Gd@C60, whereas the hydrophilic
groups head toward water.

In the interaction between carbon
nanoparticles and proteins, electrostatic
interactions are generally quantitatively smaller than those previously
discussed. Positively charged residues (arginine and lysine, in particular)
can interact with the carbon nanoparticle surfaces via cation−π
interactions. When a net charge is not present on the residue, a charge-transfer
mechanism may still occur, for example, during physisorption of aminic
and amidic residues. In contrast, when we consider EMFs, where net
charges exist on the fullerene cage, these interactions can have significant
values. Analysis of the most interacting residues shows that Arg 114,
Lys 33, and Asp 199 strongly interact with Gd@C60. Interestingly,
in the Gd@C60 cage, there is a dipolar distribution of
charges (Figure 1b).
In fact, the Gd ion is positioned close to one of the hexagonal faces
of the C60 cage. This induces negative charges on the closest
atoms via electron transfer and polarizes the Gd@C60 cage.
In the hemisphere opposite to the Gd binding position, positive charges
are induced.

On average, the fullerene cage in Gd@C60 is approximately
half positive and half negative. This charge distribution is mirrored
in the Gd@C60 binding pocket, where positively charged
Arg 114 and Lys 33 face the negative hemisphere of the fullerene,
and on the opposite side, Asp 199 faces the positive charges (Figure 4d), generating strongly
stabilizing Coulombic interactions between the protein binding pocket
and Gd@C60.

Gd@C60 vs C60 in the
C60 Binding
Pocket
In the previous section, we observed that the presence
of a Gd atom encapsulated in the C60 cage changes the favorite
recognition pocket for the binding to lysozyme. To compare directly
the differences in the protein binding between C60 and
Gd@C60, we estimated the total binding energy and their
contributions, when the two fullerenes are bound in the same protein
pocket (Figure 5).
The C60 binding pocket is well characterized, and the corresponding
binding thermodynamics has already been investigated both experimentally
and computationally;28,30,51,52,54 the same binding
pocket was used for Gd@C60.

Thus, MD simulations
were carried out for the Gd@C60–lysozyme adduct,
when it is bound in the C60 binding pocket (Figure 5a). In this case, the interaction energy (ΔGbinding) between Gd@C60 and lysozyme is −4.8
kcal mol–1, a lower value when compared to the interaction
energy of C60 with lysozyme (−18.5 kcal mol–1). This result confirms the predictive accuracy of
the docking protocol developed for EMFs.

pocket Gd@C60. (c) Total binding energy (ΔGbinding) and energy components of ΔGbinding of Gd@C60 (in gray) and C60 (in black) with lysozyme, in the C60 binding
pocket.

The analysis of the binding components
of the energy (Figure 5c) of Gd@C60 in the C60 binding site provides
an explanation of the
different behavior of C60 and Gd@C60 in their
interaction with proteins. The first difference is the presence of
a new term for Gd@C60, corresponding to the electrostatic
interaction. Whereas the highly symmetric C60 molecule
lacks net charges on the carbon atoms, for the Gd@C60 cage, the presence of the electron transfer
from the gadolinium atom to the carbon cage induces a charge distribution
on the fullerene cage (Figure 1), generating an additional stabilizing term in the binding
energy with lysozyme (Gd@C60 electrostatic term = −1.8
kcal mol–1). The appearance of this term is extremely
important because it explains qualitatively many of the differences
observed with Gd@C60 and deserves an in-depth analysis.
Even if the global effect is low, it is the result of many contributions
that counterbalance each other. In a dynamical picture, one can see
the effect of these stabilizing and destabilizing terms as a sequence
of continuous kicks toward the Gd@C60 cage. This increases
the mobility of the Gd@C60, when compared to that of the
C60, especially in a crevice-like binding pocket, such
as the substrate binding pocket of lysozyme (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Trajectories in the C60 binding site
during the 200
ns MD simulation of the (a) Gd@C60 cage (Gd ion is removed
for clarity) and (b) the C60 cage.

In the case of C60 (Figure 6b), protein residues stick to its surface
to maximize vdW interactions (C60 vdW contribution = −45.1
kcal mol–1) and become glued to the fullerene cage
(C60 entropic term = 18.1 kcal mol–1).
In contrast, the binding of the Gd@C60 to the C60 binding pocket is characterized by higher mobility (Figure 6a), due to the charges that
are present in the Gd@C60 cage. The enhanced mobility of
both Gd@C60 and protein residues interacting with the fullerene
cage reduces the entropic penalty of Gd@C60 upon lysozyme
binding (Gd@C60 entropic
term = 13.8 kcal mol–1), but at the same time decreases
the van der Waals interactions, which are the driving force for the
interaction between Gd@C60 and lysozyme (Gd@C60 vdW contribution = −26.2 kcal mol–1).

Hydrophobic interactions, i.e., nonpolar solvation, assist the
binding, even if the corresponding value for Gd@C60 (Gd@C60 nonpolar solvation term = −2.8
kcal mol–1) is smaller than that for the empty hydrophobic
C60 cage (C60 nonpolar solvation term = −4.3
kcal mol–1). The polar solvation term is detrimental
for the binding for both C60 and Gd@C60, but
the penalty is smaller for Gd@C60 than C60.
The binding of the fullerene cage occurs in the substrate binding
pocket of lysozyme, that is a region exposed to water and where amino
acids with polar side groups are located. The hydrophilic parts of
these residues, upon formation of the complex with fullerenes, are
forcefully desolvated, causing a destabilization of the system. For
the hydrophobic C60 cage (C60 polar solvation
term = 12.8 kcal mol–1), this destabilization is
greater when compared to that of the charged cage of Gd@C60 (Gd@C60 polar solvation term = 12.1 kcal mol–1).

To understand the differences between C60 and
Gd@C60, upon binding, it is interesting to re-analyze the
solvation
binding terms, from the point of view of C60 and Gd@C60 (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Total solvation energy and polar and nonpolar energy components
of total solvation energy for Gd@C60 (in gray) and C60 (in black) with lysozyme, in the C60 binding
site.

It is clear that the difference
is due to the presence of charges
in the Gd@C60 cage. The binding between C60 and
a protein is always favored because C60 is a purely hydrophobic
sphere. When it binds to a protein binding pocket, there is always
a stabilizing nonpolar term, whereas the polar solvation is null (net
charges on the cage are zero). The nonpolar solvation term takes also
into account the entropy increase due to the water molecules in the
first hydration shell that are tightly bound to the protein and are
set free upon noncovalent interactions with the fullerene (hydrophobic
effect).

On the opposite, for Gd@C60, even if a stabilizing
nonpolar
term is still present, the polar solvation term tends to overcome
it because of the net charges present in the Gd@C60 cage.
Only if there is an ideal pocket able to accommodate the Gd@C60 cage can the binding with protein take place.

Conclusions
The calculated interaction energy between Gd@C60 and
lysozyme is evaluated to be −18.7 kcal mol–1, suggesting the possibility of using proteins as supramolecular
carriers for EMFs. π–π stacking (with Trp 123,
Phe 34), hydrophobic interactions (with Val 120, Ala 122, Cys 30,
Cys 115), surfactant-like interactions (with Thr 118, Lys 33), and
electrostatic interactions (with Arg 114, Lys 33, Asp 199) govern
the global interaction between lysozyme and Gd@C60. vdW
interactions and shape complementarity remain the driving forces for
the binding, even if the presence of the electron transfer from the
gadolinium atom to the carbon cage induces a charge distribution on
the fullerene cage that strongly affects its interaction with lysozyme.
In fact, a different protein binding pocket, is identified for Gd@C60 with respect to C60. Although C60 has
a natural tendency to bind to proteins, Gd@C60 prefers
to remain in water because, upon binding, a positive polar solvation
term (which is null for C60) exists and represents an energy
penalty. In a dynamical picture, the presence of many stabilizing
and destabilizing electrostatic terms that are located closely to
each other causes continuous kicks to the Gd@C60 cage,
increasing its mobility. In conclusion, only the interaction with
a well-suited binding pocket, showing charge complementarity to the
EMF and a well-defined complementary shape, allows EMF binding to
the protein. The presence of net charges on the cage of EMF increases
the constraints to make a protein binding pocket suitable for EMF
and makes its identification more complicated.

Computational Details
QM Calculation
on Gd@C60 Molecules
The electronic
structure and geometry of the Gd@C60 adduct were investigated
by means of DFT calculations using the Gaussian 09 series of programs.79 Full geometric optimizations for Gd@C60 were carried out. A benchmark to
evaluate the performance of different DFT functionals and basis sets
to reproduce experimental data on gadofullerenes was recently performed
by Zhou and co-workers.80 Following their
results, the pure generalized gradient approximation functional Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof81 was used for DFT calculations. To take into
account the scalar relativistic effects, the effective core potential
triple split basis set (CEP-121G)82 was
used to describe the Gd atom, whereas for the carbon atoms, we employed
the 6-31G* basis set.79 When pure functionals
are used, the common medium-sized double-split 6-31G* is good enough
to calculate reasonable septet–nonet gap and Gd–C distance.80 Frequency calculations were also performed after
geometry optimization to ensure that the obtained structures are real
minima on the potential energy surface.

Parameterization of the
Gd@C60 Molecule for Molecular
Mechanics
The fullerene cage was modeled using the CA atom
type (sp2 Aromatic Carbon parameter). ESP charges were
calculated for the most stable structure of Gd@C60 according
to the Merz–Kollman (MK) scheme, a protocol used previously
to study Gd–DOTA complexes.83 van
der Waals parameters for the Gd atom were taken from the same study.83

Docking Gd@C60
A docking
protocol,44,77,84 recently validated
for the study
of interactions between proteins and nano-objects, was used to generate
the coordinates of the adduct between lysozyme and Gd@C60. This methodology is based on a two-step protocol of docking. The
shape complementarity algorithm of PatchDock85 was used to generate initial docking models of lysozyme and Gd@C60. The docking poses were then refined with FireDock.86 Sidechain flexibility is modeled by rotamers
and Monte Carlo minimization. Following the rearrangement of the side
chains, the relative position of the docking partners is refined by
Monte Carlo minimization.87 All poses were
fully minimized by AMBER 12.88 The ff12SB
force field was used to model the proteins.88 The minimization was carried out with the Sander program, using
the Generalized Born model for the solvation89 and no cut-off for van der Waals and electrostatic interactions
was adopted.

MD Production and MM-GBSA Analysis
The same protocol
of equilibration, MD production, and molecular mechanics-generalized
born surface area (MM-GBSA) recently used for C60–lysozyme
complexes51 was used in this work. The
overall sampling time was 200 ns. The calculation and decomposition
of binding free energy, ΔGbind,
between fullerenes and lysozyme were performed using the MM-GBSA scheme.63 To obtain an estimate of the binding entropy,
the translational and rotational entropies (standard statistical mechanical
formulas), and the vibrational entropy contribution (normal-mode calculations,
nmode program in AMBER) for the complex, receptor, and ligand are
calculated during the MD trajectory. The results are averaged using
the PTRAJ program via MMPBSA.py.
