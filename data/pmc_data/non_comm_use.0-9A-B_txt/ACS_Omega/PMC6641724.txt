Vacuum deposition is a simple and
controllable approach that aims
to form higher-quality perovskite films compared with those formed
using solution-based deposition processes. Herein, we demonstrate
a novel method to promote the intercalation control of inorganic cesium
lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite thin films via alternate
vacuum deposition. We also investigated the effect of layer-by-layer
deposition of PbI2/CsI to fabricate efficient planar heterojunction
CsPbI3 thin films and solar cells. This procedure is comparatively
simple when compared with commonly used coevaporation techniques;
further, precise intercalation control of the CsPbI3 thin
films can be achieved by increasing the number of layers in the layer-by-layer
deposition of PbI2/CsI. The best control and the highest
reproducibility were achieved for the deposition of four double layers
owing to the precise intercalation control during the deposition of
the CsPbI3 thin film. A power conversion efficiency of
6.79% was obtained via alternating vacuum deposition of two double
layers with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.06 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72.
Our results suggest a route for inorganic precursors to be used for
efficient perovskite solar cells via alternating vacuum deposition.

Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic
halide perovskites are an attractive
potential candidate for use as energy-efficient light-absorbing materials
for thin-film photovoltaic applications owing to their superior properties
such as their solution-processability,1 low exciton binding energy,2,3 long free charge carrier
diffusion lengths,4 high charge carrier
mobilities in conjunction with long lifetimes,5,6 and
excellent cost- and energy-efficient light absorption.7,8 Kojima et al. first introduced perovskite solar cells in 2009 with
a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.9 Park et al.10 have further improved the
PCE to 6.5% in 2011. Park, Grätzel, and colleagues reported
that perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 9.7%11 were fabricated by introducing spiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transporting
material. This encouraging discovery led to further performance enhancements,
resulting in a remarkable efficiency of 22.1% at present.12

Planar heterojunction (PHJ) perovskite
solar cells are particularly
interesting for future commercialization owing to their simple device
structures and their ability to be fabricated at low temperatures
on flexible substrates. This is in contrast to the mesostructured
perovskite devices, which require high-quality mesoporous scaffold
films that are prepared using a high-temperature sintering process
(>450 °C); such temperatures are too high for commercial applications.13,14 To avoid using a mesoporous TiO2 layer, several groups
have aimed to increase the efficiency of PHJ perovskite solar cells.15,16

The use of alternative precursors such as cesium halides (CsX)
opened up a way to obtain vacuum-deposited perovskite thin films and
solar cells while also maintaining a precise control over the deposition
rate and thickness. Cesium iodide (CsI) is considered to be a good
substitute for organic materials such as CH3NH3I [methylammonium iodide (MAI)]. Eperon et al. introduced CsPbI3-based perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 2.9% that were
fabricated, for the first time, via a facile solution process by using
a mesoporous scaffold such as TiO2.17 Meanwhile, Ripolles et al. further increased the PCE of
CsPbI3-based mesoporous TiO2 perovskite solar
cells up to 4.7%; these cells were also fabricated using solution
processing.18 In addition, Sutton et al.
improved the PCE of perovskite solar cells based on PHJ CsPbI2Br up to 9.8% (fabricated via solution processing).19 However, it is difficult to precisely control
the thickness of cesium-based perovskite films while also achieving
high-quality films using solution processing. A precise control of
the morphology and the crystallization of perovskite thin films is
well-correlated to higher perovskite solar cell performances.20,21 A nonuniform perovskite morphology limits device performances owing
to electrical shorting and charge dissociation, transport, and recombination
effects.22−24

Vacuum deposition offers a promising way of
obtaining high-quality
films with easy-to-control thicknesses as well as large-area multistack
thin films with high reproducibility and utilizing mature industrial
fabrication facilities.25 However, the
energy requirements associated with vacuum processing are substantial
and could undermine the potential advantage that perovskites have
regarding their rapid energy payback time.13 Furthermore, Malinkiewicz et al.14 have
reported perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 12% that were fabricated
by sublimation in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber. Chen et al. developed
an all-inorganic perovskite solar cell with a PCE exceeding 11% that
was fabricated via the coevaporation of cesium halide and lead halide
precursors in ultrahigh vacuum.15

Commonly, vacuum deposition methods involve the sublimation of
two kinds of precursors such as an organic halide (e.g., MAI) and
a metal halide (e.g., lead iodide, PbI2) in a vacuum chamber.
However, the main reason for such techniques not being commonly used
may be the gasification behavior of MAI, which has a small molecular
weight that causes the molecules to randomly diffuse inside the vacuum
chamber; this makes it very difficult to monitor and control the deposition
rate using quartz microbalance sensors.14,23 To overcome
this issue, many researchers have fabricated highly efficient vacuum-deposited
perovskite solar cells via sequential vacuum deposition and chemical
vapor deposition methods.16,26−28 There are now some other ways to fabricate perovskite films via
vacuum evaporation while precisely controlling the thickness and deposition
rate of the material without using a precursor with gas-like properties.15,16 Recently, we reported sequentially vacuum-deposited PHJ CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 5.71% that were fabricated
with various annealing times.29 In this
way, we developed an efficient approach to fabricate perovskite thin
films with precise intercalation, thickness, and deposition rate control,
as required for enhancing the performance of perovskite solar cells.

In this study, we replaced MAI with CsI and used an alternating
vacuum deposition method (layer-by-layer) to alternately fabricate
PbI2 and CsI layers with a precise intercalation control
to yield efficient, inorganic PHJ CsPbI3 thin films and
solar cells. A precise control over the morphologies of CsPbI3 thin films was achieved. Our findings revealed that the alternate
deposition method facilitated precise intercalation control for CsPbI3 perovskite films with enhanced performances that also had
a high reproducibility compared with films fabricated via coevaporation,
which increased device reproducibility.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a
schematic illustration of the device configuration of solar cells
based on CsPbI3.

Figure 1 Schematic illustration of the device structure
of CsPbI3-based perovskite solar cells.

Figure 2 illustrates
a variation of the number of double layers while maintaining the overall
thickness of the active layer. The thickness of the individual PbI2 and CsI layers was calculated based on the thickness of the
PbI2/CsI layer at a 1:1 molar ratio throughout the stack.
A CsI thin film with a uniform thickness and a controlled deposition
rate was obtained using alternate layer vacuum evaporation.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration
of the alternate layer deposition method
with (a) one, (b) two, (c) three, and (d) four double layers. Panel
(e) shows the schematic structure of a coevaporated CsPbI3 thin film, whereas panel (f) shows the final annealing step at 350
°C for 1 min.

The deposition of the
two double layers produces three interfaces
within the stack (Figure 2b); the thickness of each PbI2 and CsI in this
stack is lower than that in a stack containing only one double layer.
The device fabricated by evaporating four double layers (Figure 2d) has seven interfaces
within the stack, which may result in a higher penetration depth of
the CsI molecules into PbI2. We assumed that the greater
the number of evaporated double layers in the stack, the higher the
solar cell performance would be owing to better intercalation of the
resulting CsPbI3 film. The process used to fabricate the
CsPbI3 film by annealing at 350 °C for 1 min is schematically
illustrated in Figure 2f.

Varying the number of PbI2/CsI double layers
while maintaining
the overall thickness of the active layer yields the following characteristics:
(i) as the number of double layers increases, the intercalation control
of the CsPbI3 morphology also increases via the individual
manipulation of the PbI2 and CsI depositions; (ii) a perfectly
transformed CsPbI3 thin film may enhance the charge dissociation
and transport efficiency while preventing recombination, thus yielding
higher solar cell performances; (iii) alternate layer-by-layer vacuum
deposition offers the potential to minimize the contamination issues
that result from the precursors owing to the shutters of the K-cell when the precursors are evaporated, even at high
evaporation temperatures.

The J–V characteristics
at a scan speed of 0.01 V/s with a forward scan of the solar cells
obtained using the alternate vacuum deposition method were measured
under AM 1.5G illumination (shown in Figure 3), and the corresponding forward scan solar
cell parameters are listed in Table 1. The forward (from negative to positive bias) and
reverse (from positive to negative bias) scans are detailed in Figure S6. A solar cell fabricated by coevaporation
was used as a reference. The reference device had a PCE of 5.81% with
a short-circuit current density (Jsc)
of 14.33 mA/cm2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.60. By contrast,
the photovoltaic device prepared with a CsPbI3 film from
one double layer showed a Jsc of 11.98
mA/cm2. An increase in Jsc to
12.06 mA/cm2 was observed for the device prepared from
two double layers, whereas Jsc decreased
to 9.46 and 11.04 mA/cm2 for devices fabricated using films
with three and four double layers, respectively. The FF was enhanced
from 0.67 to 0.72 and 0.60 for the deposition with two double layers
and for a film deposited using coevaporation, respectively. The devices
fabricated via the layer-by-layer deposition method exhibited significantly
better performances than those using the coevaporation method. The
optimum number of double layers was two, and the best device showed
a very promising PCE of 6.79% with a high Jsc of 12.06 mA/cm2, a Voc of
0.79 V, and an FF of 0.72. These results indicate that depositing
a CsPbI3 film using two double layers causes the resulting
device to have enhanced and efficient charge dissociation as well
as superior transport properties with reduced recombination, which
leads to the improvement of the Jsc, FF,
and PCE of the resulting devices. While a PCE of 6.79% was obtained
for the solar cell fabricated with two double layers, a lower PCE
of 4.77% was observed for the solar cell prepared using four double
layers. We had assumed that increasing the number of double layers
during deposition would facilitate a more precise intercalation of
CsI into PbI2, leading to a more complete transformation
into a CsPbI3 perovskite film. The J–V characteristics of the thin films produced by depositing
the CsI/PbI2 double layers are similar to those obtained
by depositing the PbI2/CsI double layers (Figure S7).

number of double layers.

Incident photon-to-current conversion
efficiency (IPCE) curves
of the solar cells fabricated using an active layer constructed using
the alternate evaporation technique are shown in Figure 4. The enhancement of the PCE
of the devices using either the alternate evaporation method or the
coevaporation method is consistent with their corresponding IPCE values.
The photocurrents determined from the IPCE values were 12.02 and 14.17
mA/cm2 for solar cells fabricated with alternate evaporation
and coevaporation, respectively. The PHJ CsPbI3-based perovskite
solar cells exhibited a spectral response that extends from the visible
to the near-infrared wavelength region with absorption peaks at intensities
between 60 and 90% at approximately 300 to 750 nm.

to four double layers and for the coevaporated
film.

To ensure the reproducibility
of our results, solar devices were
fabricated by the deposition of one double layer (17 devices), two
double layers (11 devices), three double layers (8 devices), and four
double layers (11 devices), as shown in Figure 5. The best control and the highest reproducibility
were obtained for the deposition of four double layers owing to the
precise intercalation control during the deposition of the CsPbI3 thin film, leading to an enhanced charge dissociation and
transport efficiency and a reduction in recombination events in the
solar cells. This highlights that a perfect transformation into CsPbI3 is required in the thin films for the perovskite solar cells
to be highly reproducible.

and for the coevaporated film. Error bars indicate plus or minus one
standard deviation from the mean.

To further investigate the reason for the enhancement of
the solar
cell performance through varying the number of vacuum-evaporated double
layers, we analyzed the surface morphology of the CsPbI3 thin film using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The morphologies
of CsPbI3 thin films fabricated with a different number
of double layers are shown in Figure 6a–d. The alternate deposition process plays
an important role in the precise intercalation control of the CsPbI3 thin films.

Figure 6 SEM images of the CsPbI3 films fabricated using
(a)
one, (b) two, (c) three, and (d) four double layers.

The images in Figure 6a–d reveal that the number of white
particles is lower on
the resulting thin film, whereas increasing the number of double layers
increases the intercalation of CsI into PbI2 and leads
to a perfect transformation into a CsPbI3 perovskite film.
These observations were verified using atomic force microscopy (AFM),
as shown in Figure S3a–d. In the
SEM images, the as-deposited PbI2/CsI thin film exhibited
a small grain size (see Supporting Information, Figure S1a). Figure S1c,d shows the
morphologies (as determined by SEM) of a CsI single layer and a coevaporated
CsPbI3 thin film produced at 350 °C for 1 min, respectively.
The effect of the double layers being either PbI2/CsI or
CsI/PbI2 on the resulting CsPbI3 thin-film morphologies
was studied. Figure S4 reveals that the
as-deposited CsI/PbI2 thin film had a flower-like surface.
After annealing, the surface morphology of the resulting thin film
produced by CsI/PbI2 evaporation was similar to that obtained
by PbI2/CsI evaporation, as determined by SEM (Figure S4b).

The energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) mapping (Figure S5) was performed
to address the existence of white
particles on the perovskite films. The color intensity aids to judge
the relative amounts of elements distributed on the surface, as shown
in Figure S5a,b. The details of the elemental
composition of CsPbI3 thin films are shown in Table S1. The SEM-EDX analysis of the CsPbI3 films revealed that it was very difficult to detect white
particles on the surface of the CsPbI3 thin films. Therefore,
to further study the white particles on the surface of the CsPbI3 thin films, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) method was used.
The XRD patterns of the CsPbI3 films fabricated using various
numbers of double layers are shown in Figure 7. Diffraction peaks related to two different
structures were found; they are marked in the figure. The diffraction
peaks of the α-CsPbI3 films were detected at 2θ
angles of 14.39° and 20.59°, which were assigned to the
(100) and (110) crystal planes, respectively. These peak positions
are consistent with a cubic crystalline structure.18,30

Figure 7 XRD
patterns of CsPbI3 film fabricated using one to
four double layers.

The mean crystallite
sizes for the α-CsPbI3 crystals
formed for one, two, three, and four double layers were 33.4, 33.4,
36.3, and 39.8 nm, respectively, as estimated from the full width
at half-maximum of the (100) peak using the Scherrer formula (see Table S2). In addition, the diffraction peaks
observed at around 11.91°, 24.12°, and 28.91° correspond
to the Cs4PbI6 crystal phase.31 It should be noted that there was no Cs4PbI6 peak at 11.91° in either of the as-deposited CsPbI3-based XRD patterns, which indicates that Cs4PbI6 was not responsible for the intermediate peak. The analysis
of the XRD peak positions of the film reveals that both CsPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 phases exist in the resulting
thin films. We thus conclude that the presence of white particles
on the surface of the CsPbI3 thin films may be attributed
to the presence of Cs4PbI6. The resulting XRD
parameters are summarized in Table S2.
When two double layers were deposited, the resulting film appeared
to have a low crystallinity. However, an improved device performance
was obtained for a mixture of CsPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 crystal phases. We propose that this may be due to
the grain boundary effect that leads to an improvement of the device
performance when two double layers were used. It is worth mentioning
that the large grain boundaries, which facilitate to an efficient
charge separation and collection, result in better solar cell performance.32 Hence, we speculate that the photogenerated
carriers are more effectively separated when two double layers were
evaporated owing to the large grain boundaries in the CsPbI3 film compared with that in the other alternate evaporation films.
The number of white particles decreased as the number of double layers
of PbI2/CsI increased. We controlled the crystal phases
by changing the thickness of the alternately deposited films, which
resulted in a perfect transformation into CsPbI3. Our findings
show that the existence of the white particles is completely dependent
on the thickness of the alternately deposited layers.

The evolution
of the UV–visible (UV–vis) spectra
of the CsPbI3 thin films from the alternately deposited
layers with a molar feeding ratio of PbI2/CsI = 1:1 for
one to four double layers is shown in Figure 8. The strong absorption peak observed at
around 360 nm can be attributed to the Cs4PbI6 phase as evidenced by Nikl et al.31 The
observations from the UV–vis data were further verified by
the XRD and SEM results. Additionally, the film produced with four
double layers showed a clear absorption peak at around 410 nm, corresponding
to CsPbI3.31 We propose that
the deposition of four double layers leads to a more precise intercalation
control in the CsPbI3 thin film because the individual,
alternately deposited layers are each thinner. The thin film fabricated
with one double layer had PbI2 and CsI layer thicknesses
of 113 and 87 nm, respectively. The thin film fabricated with four
double layers had PbI2 and CsI layer thicknesses of 28.3
and 21.8 nm, respectively. However, while the thicknesses of the PbI2 and CsI layer decreased, the number of interfaces increased
along with the number of deposited double layers, as shown in Figure S2. A larger number of interfaces facilitated
a greater reaction penetration depth of the smaller CsI molecules
into PbI2, resulting in precise intercalation control of
the CsPbI3 thin film. By changing the thickness of the
alternately deposited films, we were able to create a very good chemical
reaction field that led to a perfectly transformed CsPbI3 thin film. The inset of Figure 7 clearly shows a strong absorption peak at around 410
nm, which corresponds to the CsPbI3 thin film fabricated
with four double layers. This observation is in agreement with the
results of the XRD analysis, which confirms that a precise intercalation
of CsPbI3 thin films could be obtained by changing the
thickness of the alternately deposited layers, thus providing a greater
reaction diffusion depth of the smaller CsI molecules into PbI2.

one to four double layers. Inset: a clear peak (red circle) indicating
the perfectly transformed CsPbI3 thin film (four double
layers).

Conclusions
The alternate layer
deposition method strongly influenced the CsPbI3 thin-film
morphologies, thus significantly affecting the
resulting solar cell performances. By optimizing the number of double
layers (two was optimal), a maximum PCE of 6.79% was achieved for
the resulting solar cells. An increased reproducibility of the results
was observed when using four double layers owing to the increased
intercalation control of the CsPbI3 thin film.

Experimental
Methods
FTO-patterned glass substrates were pretreated using
oxygen plasma
for 20 min prior to use. Compact TiO2 films for use as
electron collection layers were deposited via a simple chemical bath
deposition method according to the procedure developed by Kuwabara
et al.33 The CsPbI3 perovskite
layer was formed by the alternate vacuum deposition of PbI2 and CsI layers with thicknesses of 113 and 87 nm, respectively,
at a pressure of 4.0 × 10–4 Pa. Small amounts
of PbI2 and CsI powders were placed in the K-cell (diameter size 5 cm and depth 1.2 cm) and tungsten boat, respectively,
inside the chamber and carefully heated to allow outgassing. The K-cell temperature was applied at 420 °C, and the growth
rates were kept at 0.5 Å/s for PbI2 deposition. In
the case of CsI deposition, the tungsten boat with 20 A (electricity
runs on 200 V) was placed, and the growth rates were kept at 0.3 Å/s.
The thickness and growth rate were monitored with a quartz crystal
oscillator. The distances between K-cell, tungsten boat, and sample
substrate are 30 and 35 cm, respectively. We repeated the layer-by-layer
deposition of PbI2/CsI (while varying the thicknesses of
the layers) up to four times to obtain a precise control of the intercalation
for the perovskite thin films. The thicknesses of the PbI2 and CsI layers were calculated based on the thickness of the PbI2/CsI layer (molar ratio 1:1). The as-deposited films were
annealed at 350 °C for 1 min to obtain 200 nm thick CsPbI3 films. A P3HT solution in chlorobenzene (15 mg/mL) was then
spin-coated as a hole-transporting layer on CsPbI3 perovskite
thin films. The films were annealed at 150 °C for 5 min on a
hot plate in a glovebox. Finally, the films were transferred to a
vacuum chamber where 60 nm thick silver electrodes were deposited
onto the P3HT layer at 4.0 × 10–4 Pa. The active
device area was 4 mm2. The current density versus voltage
(J–V) characteristics of
the cells were analyzed under simulated AM 1.5G solar illumination
using a Keithley 2401 digital source meter. SEM (JEOL JSM-7610F) was
used to analyze the surface morphology. The XRD (Rigaku SmartLab)
spectra of the prepared films were measured using an X-ray diffractometer
with an X-ray tube (Cu Kα radiation with a wavelength of 1.5406
Å).
