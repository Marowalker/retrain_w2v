Described herein is the design of
a cell-adherent and degradable
hydrogel. Our goal was to create a self-assembling, backbone ester-containing
analogue of the cell adhesion motif, arginine–glycine–aspartic
acid (RGD). Two depsipeptides containing Fmoc (N-(fluorenyl)-9-methoxycarbonyl),
Fmoc-FR-Glc-D, and Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD (where “Glc” is glycolic
acid) were designed based on the results of integrin-binding affinity
and cell interaction analyses. Two candidate molecules were synthesized,
and their gelation characteristics, degradation profiles, and ability
to promote cell attachment were analyzed. We found that ester substitution
within the RGD sequence significantly decreases the integrin-binding
affinity and subsequent cell attachment, but when the ester moiety
flanks the bioactive sequence, the molecule can maintain its integrin-binding
function while permitting nonenzymatic hydrolytic degradation. A self-assembled
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogel showed steady, linear degradation over 60
days, and when mixed with Fmoc-diphenylalanine (Fmoc-FF) for improved
mechanical stiffness, the depsipeptide gel exhibited improved cell
attachment and viability. Though the currently designed depsipeptide
has several inherent limitations, our results indicate the potential
of depsipeptides as the basis for biologically functional and degradable
self-assembling hydrogel materials.

==== Body
Introduction
Peptide-based self-assembling
materials show great promise as injectable
scaffold materials for tissue regeneration applications, but little
work has been done to understand their long-term fate in vivo. Such
materials may not be easily degraded by the body. Indeed, the level
of matrix-degrading protease expression varies with the tissue and
cell type; thus, frequently remodeled tissues (e.g., skin) likely
have much greater protease activity than tissues with low turnover
(e.g., nerve).1,2

Recent work by our group
and others suggests that it may be possible
to engineer ester-mediated degradability into amphiphilic peptides
without disrupting their self-assembly capability.3−5 It remains unclear,
however, whether backbone ester-modified bioactive peptides retain
other biologic activities, such as cell binding. To investigate this
question and make a biologically interactive and degradable hydrogel,
we developed several self-assembling, ester-containing depsipeptides
based on a sequence with relevance to biomedical applications: arginine–glycine–aspartic
acid (RGD). This sequence is found in several extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins, is known to bind to a number of cell surface integrin
variants to mediate cell adhesion to the ECM,6 and acts as a handle for cellular interrogation of substrate mechanical
properties that are known to affect cell behavior, migration, and
differentiation.7−10

RGD and RGD-containing peptides have been incorporated into
many
synthetic hydrogel systems to encourage cell interaction with otherwise
inert materials. For this reason and the fact that the RGD sequence
is one of the shortest known biomolecular recognition sequences, we
chose to develop RGD-mimicking depsipeptides as the basis for self-assembling
degradable materials with the potential for peptide-like bioactivity.
A secondary goal was to use the system to study the role that backbone
hydrogen bonding plays in the binding of RGD peptides to an integrin
protein. While ester-modified peptides have been used previously to
elucidate the role of backbone hydrogen bonding in protein folding,11−14 β-amyloid formation,15,16 and other peptide–protein
interactions,17,18 to our knowledge there have been
no studies investigating the importance of hydrogen bonding in mediating
biomechanically important peptide–protein interactions such
as integrin–RGD binding.

Results and Discussion
Binding
Affinity Analysis of Peptides and Depsipeptides
Our initial
study was designed to test whether or not an ester substitution
within the RGD sequence allowed the ligand to retain its affinity
for cellular integrins. Fluorescence polarization (FP) spectroscopy
was used to assess the binding affinity of the depsipeptide R-Glc-D
to integrin proteins in comparison with positive (RGD) and negative
arginine–glycine–glutamic acid (RGE) tripeptide controls.
Molecular structures of R-Glc-D, RGD, and RGE are shown in Figure 1 to highlight the
similarities between the three molecules.

of RGD derivatives.

Human recombinant integrin
α5β1 was found to induce measurable
FP of 10 nM fluorescein Isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated GRGDSP peptide in Tris-buffered saline at concentrations
above 200 nM (Figure S1), and the dissociation
constant (Kd) of this interaction was
calculated as 207 nM from a curve fit using a one-site binding assumption
(GraphPad Prism 6). Competitive binding experiments, in which aliquots
of a solution of 10 nM FITC-GRGDSP and 300 nM integrin were mixed
with varying concentrations (10–9 to 10–2 M) of RGD, RGE, or R-Glc-D, revealed that R-Glc-D has some capacity
to compete with FITC-GRGDSP/integrin binding, as evidenced by the
decreasing FP with increasing R-Glc-D concentration (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Half inhibition (i.e.,
IC50) of the fluorescence of
FITC-GRGDSP occurs at a ∼40-fold lower concentration for RGD
than R-Glc-D, indicating greater affinity of RGD for integrin than
R-Glc-D (A). Comparison of FP inhibition by R-Glc-D and RGE peptides
(negative control). The average IC50 value for R-Glc-D
is 1115 ± 211 μM (mean ± standard deviation). RGE
was tested once as a negative control, and the calculated IC50 value was 2840 μM (B).

RGD inhibited FP with an IC50 of 26.8 μM
(Table 1), a level
about 42
times greater than that of R-Glc-D, whereas RGE displayed slightly
less FP inhibition relative to R-Glc-D (Figure 2). Inhibition constant (Ki) values were calculated assuming Kd = 207 nM, using the FP-specific method developed by Nikolovska-Coleska,
et al.19 Glc-RGD was not included in the
competitive binding experiments as it has four residues rather than
three, and rigorous characterization of how ester bond substitutions
flanking a bioactive peptide sequence affect the binding activity
is outside the scope of the current study.

Adhesion and Morphology of Cells on Surface-Modified Glass
Based on the binding affinity analysis above, we proceeded to evaluate
cell adhesion and spreading behavior on glass surfaces covalently
functionalized with peptide or depsipeptide moieties. Our evaluation
included RGD and RGE as well as R-Glc-D, in which the ester bond is
included within the bioactive sequence, and Glc-RGD, in which the
ester bond is adjacent to the RGD ligand. Assessment of cell adhesion
and spreading in two dimensions was chosen to reduce the variability
encountered with the use of 3D gels. Successful coupling of Fmoc-amino
acids to amino-polyethylene glycol (PEG) glass was confirmed by checking
for fluorescence of the Fmoc group using a fluorimeter with a solid
state sample holder (Figure S2).20 NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on these substrates
for 4 h, fixed, stained with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin and DAPI,
and imaged. Fluorescence microscopy images shown in Figure 3 demonstrate significantly
increased cell number and adhesion on RGD and Glc-RGD-presenting surfaces
relative to other groups (Table 2); R-Glc-D surfaces were not statistically different
from PEG-only and RGE surfaces in terms of cell attachment.

Cell spreading was assessed by measuring the area and perimeter
of attached cells in 40× images. Only cells on RGD and Glc-RGD
surfaces were significantly greater for both metrics than cells on
other surfaces. Cell circularity, a shape parameter to describe roundness,
was also calculated for each measured cell. Cells on RGD and Glc-RGD
surfaces tended to be less circular because of the spreading and extension
of pseudopodia and filopodia, presumably because of the strong affinity
of their surface integrin proteins for the peptide surface. Finally,
upon examination of the micrographs, it is clear that actin filaments
within cells on RGD and Glc-RGD surfaces are bundled into stress fibers,
whereas on other surfaces, actin staining is diffused and delocalized.
Stress fibers are characteristic of cells generating traction forces
on a surface,21 and as they are not observed
in cells on PEG, RGE, and R-Glc-D surfaces, we infer that cells are
not likely to interact strongly or specifically with these molecules.
In other words, these nonadhesive surfaces seem not to induce intracellular
signaling pathways initiated by integrin binding and/or focal adhesion
complex formation that ultimately result in cytoskeletal organization
and stress fiber formation. From these results, it appears that hydrogen
bonding by backbone amide groups within the RGD sequence may be as
critical as the side-chain identity and sequence in mediating specific
and functional binding with cell surface integrin proteins. Thus,
while ester incorporation may be useful for introducing hydrolytic
degradability into self-assembling peptide systems, the bioactive
sequences must exclude rather than incorporate esters to retain full
functionality.

Gelation of Self-Assembling Peptides and
Depsipeptides
Fmoc-RGD has previously been reported to promote
molecular self-assembly
into hydrogels, which are able to support cell attachment and spreading
in culture.22 In our initial efforts to
synthesize a self-assembling RGD analogue, we found that generally,
ester substitution of Fmoc-containing peptides resulted in much slower
gelation kinetics. For example, we synthesized Fmoc-R-Glc-D and demonstrated
that at a concentration of ∼15 mg/mL, this molecule self-assembles
over the course of 2–3 days to form gels by pH switch both
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and deionized (DI) water with 50
mM NaCl added (see Figure S3). However,
the slow gelation time limited the utility of Fmoc-R-Glc-D for functional
tests of cell adhesion and spreading. In part, because of the work
of Gazit and co-workers demonstrating the self-assembly of Fmoc-FRGD23 and also our own previous work with longer,
charged depsipeptides,5 we hypothesized
that adding a phenylalanine residue to Fmoc-R-Glc-D would dramatically
decrease the time of gelation for our Fmoc-depsipeptides.

On
the basis of previous gelation, integrin interaction, and cell attachment
studies, Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD and Fmoc-FR-Glc-D were therefore selected
as the self-assembling depsipeptide candidates for investigating cell
attachment and degradation. These depsipeptides, as well as Fmoc-FRGD
(positive control) and Fmoc-FRGE (negative control), were synthesized
using a combination of standard solid phase peptide synthesis techniques
and methods that our lab previously developed.24 All of the synthesized molecules, whose structures are
given in Figure 4,
were capable of forming a hydrogel via self-assembly as shown by vial
inversion.

Figure 4 Molecular structures of self-assembling peptides and depsipeptides.
Fmoc-FRGD, Fmoc-FRGE, Fmoc-FR-Glc-D, and Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD are all able
to form self-supporting hydrogels under solvent-exchange or pH switch
conditions.

Excluding Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD,
5 mg/mL solutions of all molecules were
capable of self-assembly leading to gelation both by pH switch and
solvent exchange. In the case of Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, a hydrogel was formed
by solvent exchange when the concentration was above 10 mg/mL, but
gelation was not observed with the pH switch method. Comparing Fmoc-FRGD
hydrogels formed by different gelation methods, the storage modulus
of the solvent exchange hydrogels was higher than that of the pH-switched
hydrogels (Figure S4). Because local pH
changes during acid addition result in spatial variations in gel density,
the pH switch method generally results in a less homogeneous hydrogel
than the solvent exchange method,25 and
this could give rise to different rheological characteristics. Furthermore,
the resulting hydrogel formed by solvent exchange (pH ≈ 4.8)
had a lower pH than the hydrogel formed by pH switch (pH ≈
5.5). The lower final pH may increase the ratio of molecules with
a protonated C-terminal −OH group, thus increasing the average
hydrophobicity of the molecules, which may in turn lead to a greater
propensity for intermolecular association and a resulting increase
in storage modulus. In addition, Raeburn et al. showed that the mechanical
properties of self-assembled hydrogels can be tuned and influenced
by the identity and the final volume fraction of the organic solvent.26 They demonstrated that the structure of the
hydrogel network and the kinetics of gelation were affected by gelation
conditions. Thus, the properties of self-assembled hydrogels depend
both on the molecular structure and the gelation method.

Degradation
of Self-Assembling Depsipeptides
Degradation
profiles of 5 mg/mL Fmoc-FRGD (as a control), 5 mg/mL Fmoc-FR-Glc-D,
and 10 mg/mL Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogels (all made by solvent exchange)
were constructed by periodically analyzing gel samples using high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and calculating the fractional chromatogram
peak areas of the gelator molecule and its respective Fmoc-containing
degradation product (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Degradation profile of the self-assembling hydrogel of 5 mg/mL
Fmoc-FRGD (A), 5 mg/mL Fmoc-FR-Glc-D (B), and 10 mg/mL Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD
(C). Unlike Fmoc-FRGD, depsipeptides were gradually degraded over
60 days. All gels were made by solvent exchange.

In contrast with Fmoc-FRGD, which maintained its molecular
structure,
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD and Fmoc-FR-Glc-D showed significant degradation over
2 months; a new peak in the chromatogram, corresponding to either
Fmoc-FR or Fmoc-F, the ester hydrolysis products of Fmoc-FR-Glc-D
and Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, respectively, grew in fractional areas over time
while the starting product peak decreased. Interestingly, both depsipeptides
degraded relatively linearly during the early phase (approximately
30 days for Fmoc-FR-Glc-D and 50 days for Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD) according
to the R2 value, which was 0.97 for Fmoc-FR-Glc-D
and 0.93 for Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, by the least squares method. At the termination
of the degradation period, it was noted that the gels had not entirely
collapsed. It is unknown whether the remaining gel structures are
composed exclusively of the starting depsipeptides or the gels retain
the degradation products Fmoc-FR and Fmoc-F in the fibrous nanostructure;27 however, no precipitates were observed visually
at the end of the degradation period. If indeed Fmoc-FR and Fmoc-F
are stabilized within the existing fibrous nanostructure rather than
precipitated, it is possible that they contribute to the overall gel
stability observed.

Cell Spreading and Viability on Self-Assembled
Hydrogels
To assess the basic feasibility of using degradable
self-assembling
Fmoc-depsipeptides as cell-supporting matrices for tissue engineering,
we performed two-dimensional (2D) cell culture experiments over the
self-assembled solvent-exchanged hydrogels, and cell morphology and
viability were measured (Figures 6 and 7A). For these experiments,
we did not include Fmoc-FR-Glc-D, as earlier FP and cell spreading
experiments described above suggested that the inclusion of the ester
bond within the bioactive RGD sequence reduces its integrin-binding
affinity to levels below than needed for proper biomechanical function.
Thus, we chose to evaluate cell spreading and viability only on the
degradable Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD gels, with the Fmoc-FRGD gels serving as
the positive control.

on Fmoc-FRGD (A,D), Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD (B,E), and a mixture (10 mg/mL
of Fmoc-FF and Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD) (C,F) of self-assembling hydrogels.
Whereas most cells on Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD were round, extended cells were
observed on Fmoc-FRGD and the hydrogel made from a mixture of Fmoc-FF
and Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD. Scale bars = 200 μm (A–C) and 50
μm (D–F).

Figure 7 Viability of fibroblasts on self-assembling hydrogel samples (A)
and storage and loss modulus of cell-free gel samples (B). Statistical
analysis was performed for several groups (** for p < 0.01 and *** for p < 0.001).

Rheological characterization of Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD
and Fmoc-FRGD gels
shows that at its minimal gelation concentration of 10 mg/mL, Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD
is nearly 3 times softer than Fmoc-FRGD at half of that concentration
(see Figures 7B and S4). To avoid confounding the effects of matrix
compliance and integrin-binding affinity in assessing cell spreading,7 we opted to use Fmoc-FF as a co-gelator to provide
mechanical support to the Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD gels. We chose Fmoc-FF because
of its extensive characterization in the literature, relatively high
storage modulus when gelled by solvent exchange (10–20 kPa),
and previous use as a co-gelator for cell culture studies.28−31 We also hypothesized that Fmoc-FF molecules would interact favorably
with the Fmoc- and phenylalanine side chain groups in Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD,
thus enhancing the overall stability of the nanostructures formed.

Fibroblasts cultured on the Fmoc-FF hydrogel exhibited very little
viable cell attachment (∼25%). In contrast, on the Fmoc-FRGD
hydrogel, the viable cell attachment was near 100% of control with
extended morphology. Cells on the Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogel, however,
exhibited a rounded shape and an intermediate level of cell attachment
at approximately 50% of control. As previously mentioned, we were
concerned that the softness of the Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogel relative
to the Fmoc-FRGD hydrogel (Figure 7B) could have an effect on the cell attachment, independent
of the integrin binding.32 To resolve this
question, Fmoc-FF, which is able to make a much stiffer hydrogel,
was mixed with Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD.30 The stiffness
of the hydrogel mixture depended on the relative amounts of the constituents
and was reduced sharply as the concentration of Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD was
increased (Figures 7B and S4). However, the Fmoc-FF/Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD
mixture hydrogels were still more rigid than the single component
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogel. The mixture hydrogels also had an improved
viable cell attachment and increased cell spreading above a concentration
of 0.5 mg/mL of Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD compared to either the single component
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogel or Fmoc-FF hydrogel (Figures 6 and 7A). Fibroblasts
on the Fmoc-FRGD hydrogel were viable after 24 h in agreement with
other reports,23 but the numbers of viable
fibroblasts on either the Fmoc-FF or the degradable hydrogels at longer
time points were minimal. It is unclear whether this loss of viability
over time for the degradable hydrogels is a result of loss of integrin-binding
capacity (as the RGD ligand is cleaved thus resulting in cell detachment),
a result of the effects of the degradation products on cell viability,
or a combination of both factors.33

Summary
and Conclusions
Our results demonstrate the potential of
depsipeptides as the basis
for self-assembling hydrogel materials with biological function and
controlled hydrolytic degradation. We found that at least in the case
of the RGD sequence, ester substitution within the bioactive sequence
reduces the affinity for integrin in a manner that evades cell attachment
and spreading. However, the depsipeptide with the ester flanking the
bioactive RGD sequence, Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, was able to form a hydrogel
with relatively short kinetics and degrade approximately linearly
over 60 days, in contrast with its nondegradable analogue. By mixing
this engineered depsipeptide hydrogelator with the nonRGD containing
Fmoc-FF, we were able to increase the stiffness of the resulting gel,
which supported greater viable cell attachment and spreading than
either the Fmoc-FF or Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD gels alone. The major limitations
of the current design are the potential for RGD cleavage and loss
of cell-binding capacity prior to the hydrogel disassembly as well
as the unknown cytotoxicity of the degradation products, in particular,
Fmoc-F. One factor confounding the decoupling of these effects is
that Fmoc-F is not readily soluble in water at physiological pH and
temperature and is not known to be able to directly form gels that
might be used directly for cytotoxicity analysis. Our group is therefore
investigating alternatives to the Fmoc-F terminus to drive the self-assembly.

Experimental
Section
Solution-Phase Synthesis of Depsipeptide Units (Fmoc-R-Glc and
Fmoc-F-Glc)
Depsipeptides were synthesized using a combinatorial
solution- and solid-phase synthesis approach previously developed
by our lab.24 Through this approach, the
Fmoc-protected depsipeptide units of a specific amino- and α-hydroxy-acid
combination can be incorporated into peptides synthesized on a solid
resin support using well-established coupling chemistries and automated
peptide synthesizing instruments. For the present study, we synthesized
side-chain-protected Fmoc-arginine(pentamethyldihydrobenzylfuran-5-sulfonyl)-glycolic
acid (abbreviated as Fmoc-R(Pbf)-Glc) and Fmoc-phenylalanine-glycolic
acid (Fmoc-F-Glc) depsipeptide units in solution. Glycolic acid (Acros
Organics) was first carboxyl-protected. Glycolic acid and 1.5 equiv
benzyl chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in a minimal volume
of ethyl acetate, and then, 1.5 equiv triethylamine (TEA, Acros Organics)
was added. The mixture was refluxed at 85 °C overnight, filtered
to remove TEA-chloride salts, and then distilled to remove excess
benzyl chloride. Excess benzyl chloride was removed from the mixture
by vacuum distillation to yield pure benzyl glycolate (Glc-Bn). Glc-Bn
was then dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) with 1.2 equiv Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH
(Novabiochem) and 0.01 equiv dimethylaminopyridine, and the mixture
was chilled on ice. In the case of a reaction with Glc-Bn and Fmoc-Phe-OH
(Novabiochem), a minimal volume of dimethylformamide (DMF) was used
for dissolving Fmoc-Phe-OH. To the chilled mixture, was added 1.2
equiv dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction was allowed to warm to
room temperature overnight, after which the mixture was filtered to
remove dicyclohexylurea crystals and concentrated in vacuo. The carboxyl-protected
Fmoc-depsipeptide product (either Fmoc-R(Pbf)-Glc-Bn or Fmoc-F-Glc-Bn)
was then purified by flash chromatography (av yield ≈ 85–90%)
and concentrated in vacuo. Pure benzylated Fmoc-depsipeptides were
benzyl-deprotected by catalytic hydrogenolysis, following the general
method developed by Bajwa.34 Fmoc-R(Pbf)-Glc-Bn
or Fmoc-F-Glc-Bn was dissolved in a minimal volume of absolute ethanol
with DCM added to aid the dissolution. To this mixture, 10 equiv 1,4-cyclohexadiene
(Acros Organics) was added, followed by a mass of palladium on carbon
(Pd/C, 10% Pd, Acros Organics) equivalent to the mass of the reactant.
This mixture was stirred at room temperature for at least 3 h, and
the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). The
mixture was then filtered in vacuo through a Celite pad and triturated
with hot ethanol and hot DCM, which was then reconcentrated in vacuo.
The crude product was then dissolved in <10 mL of dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO) and purified by reversed-phase (RP) flash chromatography using
a RediSep Gold C18 column on a CombiFlash instrument (Teledyne Isco)
with a 45 min linear gradient of 0–95% acetonitrile in water.
The pure product was then lyophilized from a concentrated solution
in acetonitrile and stored as a powder at −20 °C for future
use.

Solid-Phase Coupling and Purification of Fmoc-Peptides and Fmoc-Depsipeptides
All peptides and depsipeptides were coupled on solid phase using
diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC)/OxymaPure (ethyl 2-cyano-2-(hydroxyimino)acetate)
amide coupling chemistry. Depending on the desired sequence, either
Fmoc-Asp(OtBu)-Wang resin or Fmoc-Glu(OtBu)-Wang resin was swelled
in DCM in a fritted, capped syringe for 20 min. The resin was rinsed
with DMF, and then Fmoc groups were removed with 20% piperidine in
DMF (5 mL). After addition to the resin, the capped syringe was placed
in a BioWave scientific microwave oven (Ted Pella, Inc.) operating
at ∼100 W and subjected to microwave energy in 30 s increments
for a total of 2 min. At the end of each 30 s increment, the mixture
was vortexed. This process was repeated twice more with fresh piperidine
solution to ensure complete Fmoc removal. The resin was then washed
(vortexed 4 × 15 mL DMF followed by 4 × 15 mL DCM) and a
coupling solution containing the next Fmoc-amino acid was added to
the resin. Coupling solutions consisted of 3 equiv of the Fmoc-amino
acid and 3 equiv of OxymaPure in less than 10 mL of DMF, to which
3 equiv of DIC was added. The mixture was allowed to pre-activate
for at least 10 min before adding to resin (for most amino acids,
a yellow color develops upon DIC addition). After microwaving (5 min
at ∼100 W with mixing every 30 s), the resin was washed (vortexed
4 × 15 mL DMF followed by 4 × 15 mL DCM). The subsequent
coupling steps followed the same Fmoc-deprotection, washing, and coupling
methods. For coupling the solution-synthesized Fmoc-depsipeptide units,
a similar protocol was used, with a slight difference. For the coupling
solution, only 2 equiv of Fmoc-R(Pbf)-Glc or Fmoc-F-Glc was used in
an effort to conserve the material.

Upon completion of coupling,
the peptide (or depsipeptide) was cleaved from the resin and side
chains were simultaneously deprotected by adding 5 mL of a solution
of 95:2.5:2.5 trifluoroacetic acid/water/triisopropylsilane (TFA/H2O/TIPS) and mixing for 1.5–2 h. The mixture was then
collected in a clean round bottom flask, and subsequent resin washes
(1 × 5 mL TFA/H2O/TIPS and 5 × 10 mL DCM) were
added to the flask before concentrating in vacuo on a rotary evaporator.
Excess TFA and H2O were removed by repeatedly adding acetone
or DCM and reconcentrating. The resulting oil was dissolved in <5
mL DMF and the product was precipitated with cold diethyl ether to
form a white product. The mixture was split into separate centrifuge
tubes, centrifuged and triturated and vortexed with cold ether, and
then recombined into a single tube, followed by three subsequent rounds
of centrifugation and trituration/vortexing to remove excess TFA and
scavenged side-chain protecting groups. After drying the product under
a gentle stream of N2, the product was redissolved in DMF
or DMSO and purified by RP-HPLC (0% H2O initially for 10–15
min to remove excess DMF/DMSO, followed by a 30–40 min linear
gradient of 0–90% acetonitrile in water). Pure product fractions
were collected and lyophilized at a low temperature (−100 °C
collector) for 2 days.

FP Assays
RGD, R-Glc-D, and RGE
peptides were synthesized
and purified as their Fmoc-terminated versions, as described above.
After purification by HPLC and lyophilization, Fmoc-RGD, Fmoc-R-Glc-D,
or Fmoc-RGE was dissolved in a minimal volume of DMF in a round-bottom
flask, and 200 μL of piperidine was added to the mixture. The
mixture was stirred, and within 2 min, a white precipitate (peptide)
formed. Cold diethyl ether was added to the flask, and the suspension
was divided among four 50 mL centrifuge tubes. The precipitate was
centrifuged and then resuspended and combined in one tube. The aggregated
precipitate was then washed and centrifuged four times using fresh,
cold diethyl ether each time. After decanting the ether supernatant
from the final wash, nitrogen gas was gently blown over the pellet
to remove the excess diethyl ether. The pellet was dissolved in a
minimal volume of DI water and filtered to remove colloidal dibenzofulvene
particles. Removal by filtration was confirmed using TLC. The clear
filtrate was then lyophilized, and the peptide identity and purity
was confirmed using TLC.

For FP assays, inhibitor peptides (RGD—positive
control and R-Glc-D and RGE—negative control) were diluted
in series from 3 × 10–9 to 3 × 10–2 M in Tris with 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, and 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.4. Human
recombinant integrin α5β1 (R&D
Systems) was diluted to 900 nM in the same Tris buffer. FITC-GRGDSP
(Anaspec, Inc.) was also diluted in the same Tris buffer to 30 nM.
To each test well in a black-bottom 384-well plate, 10 μL of
the chosen dilution of RGD, R-Glc-D, or RGE was added to 20 μL
of a 1:1 integrin/FITC-GRGDSP solution. For the positive control well,
10 μL of buffer was added in the place of inhibitor solution.
For the negative control well, 10 μL of FITC-GRGDSP alone was
added to 20 μL of Tris buffer. Plates were covered and incubated
at room temperature at least 30 min before use. The FP of the wells
was read using a BioTek Synergy H4 instrument operating at default
FITC excitation (λ = 485 nm) and emission (λ = 528 nm)
wavelengths. Fluorescence anisotropy data from different experiments
were normalized by calculating the percentage of each well’s
value relative to the highest anisotropy value observed in any given
experiment.

Covalent Functionalization of Glass Coverslips
with Amine-Terminated
PEG
Glass surfaces were functionalized with RGD peptides
or R-Glc-D and Glc-RGD depsipeptides to assess cell adhesion and spreading
in a system that facilitates imaging and quantitative assessment.
Functionalization was accomplished using the methods described by
Todd et al.35 Circular glass coverslips
(18 mm diameter, thickness “2”) were cleaned by sonicating
for 10 min in acetone, followed by rinsing with DI water. Coverslips
were then submerged in 3 M NaOH for 5 min, rinsed with DI water, and
submerged in a piranha solution (30 v/v % concentrated sulfuric acid
and 70 v/v % hydrogen peroxide). After 1 h, coverslips were removed
and rinsed in a large excess of DI water and air-dried completely.
An epoxide-terminated silane, (3-glycidyloxipropyl)trimethoxysilane
(GOPTS, Sigma-Aldrich), was pipetted onto the surface of half the
coverslips, and the remaining coverslips were placed on top of the
GOPTS to reduce air exposure. The sandwiched coverslips were then
placed in an oven at 37 °C for at least 2 h, after which the
coverslips were washed with dry acetone and dried under N2. Immediately following, homobifunctional diamino-PEG (H2N–PEG–NH2) in dry powder form was placed
directly on the silane-functionalized surface of half of the coverslips,
which were then placed in an oven at ∼75 °C. The PEG powder
melted into a semiviscous liquid, and while still in the oven, the
remaining coverslips were placed on top of the PEG-covered coverslips
with the silane side facing down. The coverslip–PEG assemblies
were incubated at 75 °C for 48 h to provide sufficient time for
complete coupling of the PEG-terminal amine groups to the epoxide
groups on the silanated glass. After incubation, coverslips were disassembled
while still hot (to prevent PEG recrystallization/hardening) and were
rinsed with a large excess of DI water. Coverslips were then marked
to indicate the non-PEGylated side.

Peptide Synthesis on Glass
Substrates
For solid-phase
synthesis of peptides on PEGylated glass substrates, coverslips were
immersed in preactivated coupling solutions and subjected to microwave
energy. Coupling solutions were similar to those prepared for normal
resin-bound peptide synthesis, with 0.2–0.8 mmol Fmoc-amino
acid or glycolic acid and 2 equiv of OxymaPure dissolved in ∼6
mL of DMF, followed by addition of 2 equiv of DIC and 10 min of preactivation
prior to coupling. For each amino acid coupling step, 2 mL of coupling
solution was added to a glass Petri dish containing several coverslips
with the PEGylated side facing up, and the coverslips were microwaved
for 3 min at 250 W (very little heating was observed). This process
was repeated two more times with a fresh coupling solution each time.
Coverslips were then washed thoroughly with DMF. To remove Fmoc groups,
∼2 mL 20% piperidine in DMF was added to the Petri dish and
the dish was microwaved for 2 min. This process was repeated two more
times with fresh piperidine solution, and then, coverslips were washed
thoroughly with DMF. Subsequent Fmoc-amino acid or Fmoc-depsipeptide
couplings were performed as described above until the full peptide
was generated. In the case of coupling glycolic acid for Glc-RGD-functionalized
PEG-glass, glycolic acid was used directly as a reactant with the
standard coupling reagents, and the reaction time was monitored using
the Kaiser color test for free amines.36

Solid-state fluorescence spectroscopy was used to confirm
the coupling of peptides to the PEG-glass surfaces through the fluorescence
of the Fmoc group at an excitation wavelength of 270 nm and emission
spectrum from 290 to 360 nm. Finally, to cleave peptide side-chain
protecting groups but leave the peptide C-terminus attached to the
PEG-glass, a 95:2.5:2.5 TFA/H2O/TIPS mixture was applied
to the coverslips and allowed to incubate at room temperature for
2 h, followed by thorough washing with DMF, DCM, and water. Coverslips
were sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol in DI water prior to seeding
with cells.

Cell Culture and Spreading Assessment on
Functionalized Glass
NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured from
the frozen stock in standard
tissue culture flasks and passaged at least twice before experimental
use. For adhesion and spreading on glass substrates, cells were trypsinized,
centrifuged, and resuspended in a serum-free medium. Peptide-functionalized
glass substrates were placed in separate wells of 12-well plates and
washed 2× with PBS. Cell suspensions were added at a seeding
density of ∼6500 cells/cm2 and incubated for 4–5
h. Nonadherent cells were washed away with PBS, and adherent cells
were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS for 10 min. After fixation, coverslips
were washed with PBS and cells were permeabilized with a 0.1% Triton
X-100 solution. After washing 3× with PBS, cell actin filaments
were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Life Technologies) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol and incubated for 30 min. The
solution was removed, and a DAPI nuclear stain (5 μg/mL) was
applied and allowed to incubate for 10 min. After washing 3×
with PBS, coverslips were removed from wells, mounted on glass microscope
slides, and imaged on a microscope with fluorescence excitation using
DAPI and FITC filter cubes. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. The
cell number in 15 separate 10× images was assessed by automated
counting of DAPI-stained nuclei through the use of a custom thresholding
and particle counting macro. Cell area, perimeter, and circularity
were measured using the ImageJ trace and a measure tool on 10 representative
cells from images at 40× magnification. The pixel-to-distance
relationship used to calculate the actual distance and area metrics
in micrometer was established by capturing a photo of a hemocytometer
grid at 40× using the same microscope and attached camera used
for cell imaging. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism 6. A one-way analysis of variance test was performed, followed
by Tukey’s test for multiple comparisons. P-values corrected for multiple comparisons are reported.

Gelation of
Self-Assembling Peptides and Depsipeptides
Two methods, pH
switch and solvent exchange, were employed to generate
the hydrogels. For the pH switch method, a solution of 1 equiv 0.5
M NaOH with 1 equiv gelator molecule solution was prepared and mixed
until it became transparent, after which 1 equiv 0.1 M HCl was added
to the solution and gently mixed. The solution was left undisturbed
until gelation was observed. In the case of the solvent exchange method,
a 50× solution (i.e., 50 times the desired final concentration)
of the gelator molecule in the DMSO solution was prepared. A 49-to-1
volume ratio of DI water to the gelator solution was added and gently
mixed to achieve the final desired concentration, and the solutions
were left undisturbed until gelation was observed. When making the
mixed “co-gelator” hydrogels by solvent exchange, 100×
solutions of each gelator molecule in DMSO were prepared individually
and then premixed before adding DI water in the proper volume ratio.
In this manner, the gels with varying co-gelator ratios could be made,
but all had the same final DMSO content.

Degradation Profile Assessment
The degradation characteristics
of the Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, Fmoc-FR-Glc-D, and Fmoc-FRGD hydrogels (made
by solvent exchange with DI water, at a concentration of 5 mg/mL except
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD at 10 mg/mL) were assessed by the following method.
The gels were formed in tight-sealing microcentrifuge tubes and placed
in a 37 °C incubator, and at specified time points, 50 μL
of each sample gel was dissolved in 450 μL methanol and analyzed
by LC–MS. Fractional peak area percentages were calculated
from peak integrations and plotted as a function of time. Evaporation
of liquid was not visually evident, nor was any obvious bacterial
contamination.

Gel Rheology
Storage and loss modulus
of the Fmoc-FF,
Fmoc-FRGD, Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, and mixtures of Fmoc-FF and Fmoc-FRGD or
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD hydrogels (made by solvent exchange) were measured
by an Anton-Paar MCR101 rheometer with a parallel plate geometry (top
plate diameter of 8 mm). Briefly, self-assembled hydrogels were formed
in polydimethylsiloxane molds (3 mm deep, 8 mm diameter). Oscillatory
shear stress rheometry was performed (1% strain, 0.5–100 Hz),
and the storage and loss modulus of the hydrogels at 1.99 Hz were
used for analysis.

2D Cell Morphology Analysis and Viability
Assay
Two-dimensional
cell spreading and viability experiments were performed by seeding
3T3 fibroblasts on the surfaces of hydrogels of Fmoc-FF, Fmoc-FRGD,
Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD, and mixtures of Fmoc-FF and Fmoc-FRGD or Fmoc-F-Glc-RGD.
DMSO/gelator solutions were sterile-filtered to prevent bacterial
contamination. Before cell seeding, 100 μL of each hydrogel
(made by solvent exchange using sterile DI water) was formed in a
48-well microplate and equilibrated with serum-free Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium-containing antibiotics. This equilibration
was performed twice to remove most of the DMSO and equilibrate the
pH of the gels. Aliquots of 2 × 104 fibroblasts in
serum-free media were transferred to each hydrogel-containing well,
and the complete medium was added after 2 h of incubation. The cell
morphology was analyzed using bright-field and fluorescence imaging
(Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin and DAPI), and an MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, CellTiter 96, Promega] assay
was performed to measure the viable cell attachment after 6 h.
