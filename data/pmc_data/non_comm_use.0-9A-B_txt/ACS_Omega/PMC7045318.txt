Reports of marine organisms ingesting
microplastics—formed from large plastic litter drifting in
the marine environment by mechanical forces such as waves and photochemical
processes initiated by sunlight, particularly ultraviolet rays—are
increasing. However, the degradation process from microplastics to
nanoplastics that are easily consumed by plankton located in the lower
part of the food chain is not clear. Therefore, 200 nm diameter polystyrene
(PS) latex particles—nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) calibration
particles—dispersed in ultrapure deionized water were subjected
to three types of agitation: rotation mixing, shaking, and flowing
in addition to standing without agitation, and the physical degradation
caused by agitation for 1 week at room temperature (23 °C) was
evaluated. The degradation of the particles into nanosized particles
was assessed by particle size distribution measurement using NTA and
shape observation using field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM). In addition, the ratio of particle aggregation during incubation
was calculated from the number of particles present in the region
exceeding the particle size distribution range of the monodisperse
particles before agitation with respect to the total number of particles.
A shape change to a particle size of 100 nm or less was observed for
the rotating and flowing of samples, and the influence of aggregation
was suppressed to within 21% of the total particles calculated by
NTA at the maximum. These results show that chemically stable PS can
be degraded from micro- to nanosize with simple agitation in ultrapure
deionized water.

Introduction
Polystyrene
(PS) does not degrade in the cellular environment and
does not show short-term cytotoxicity.1 In addition, PS nanoparticles (NPs) can be easily synthesized in
various sizes and have a clear surface functionality, making them
a convenient platform for studying nanoparticle–cell interactions.1−5 However, harmful substances, such as environmental hormones adsorbed
on microplastics (100 nm to 5 μm) and nanoplastics (≤100
nm), can migrate from the digestive organs of an organism to fat cells
and bioaccumulate. Furthermore, there is concern that these chemicals
may be concentrated up the food chain and eventually have a damaging
effect on human health. In this process, nondegradable PS has a risk
of being repeatedly acted as a transporter of harmful substances to
the human body.6 Microplastics are generated
from waste plastic as a result of wind and rain on land, wave forces
in the ocean and on the shore, breaking or rubbing with sand and pebbles
on the shore, and complex factors such as geological movements of
mud and sand on the ocean floor. A calculation based on the approximated
79 000 tons of trash floating in the Pacific Ocean estimated
31% of it to be microplastic.7 The core
of the microplastic problem is the adsorption and concentration of
toxic chemicals on the microplastics, which are then incidentally
ingested by marine organisms.8 Nanoplastics,
in particular, are consumed by plankton located in the lower part
of the food chain. Fish then eat the plankton, which concentrates
harmful substances such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) in the food
chain.

PS is a common plastic in the marine environment,9 which drifts in the ocean because its specific
gravity
is lower than that of seawater, like polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene
(PE).10 PS and PE have been reported to
adsorb polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAHs) at a higher concentration
than PP.11 It has also been reported that
oral administration of PS particles can adversely affect iron uptake
and transport in human small intestinal epithelial cell models and
live chicken small intestine models.12 It
has been found that the proportion of PS particles taken up from the
gastrointestinal mucosa of rats depends on the particle size and that
smaller particles are more likely to be taken up. In addition, the
distribution in the body after ingestion depends on the particle size,
and the smaller the particle, the faster the distribution to each
organ.13 Whether waste plastics can be
degraded to nanosize particles in nature was under question; however,
the formation of PS particles from disposable PS coffee cup lids by
exposure to ultraviolet and visible light14 and mechanical grinding15 has now been
shown in particle size distribution measurements by nanoparticle tracking
analysis (NTA). However, there have been no reports on the degradation
process from microplastics to nanoplastics. Therefore, measuring the
concentration and size of microplastics and nanoplastics in the environment
is essential for assessing the risks posed by plastic particles.16 Because NTA measurements are based on both scattered
light and Brownian motion characteristics, the technique has been
reported to be appropriate for characterizing drug delivery nanoparticles
and protein aggregates.17

Micro-/nanoparticles
have a high tendency for adhesion and aggregation;
therefore, to use these particles, aggregation and dispersion control
are extremely important. For this purpose, it is first necessary to
accurately grasp the aggregation state of the nanoparticles. Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) and laser diffraction (LD)/scattering particle
size analysis are qualitative methods, but have a wide dynamic range.
We evaluated the aggregation of particles by analyzing the particle
size distribution obtained by non-negative least-squares fitting of
DLS data.18 Moreover, the size of aggregated
particles was calculated from the delay in the observation time of
the scattered light during DLS measurements.19 At present, there are no methods available that can quantitatively
evaluate the nanometer to millimeter range; however, in the submicrometer
range (0.1–1 μm), quantitative detection can be performed
using NTA or resonance mass measurements (RMM). Each analysis method
has advantages and disadvantages, and analysis using a single method
involves a risk of error. In fact, it has been reported that the coefficient
of variation (CV) of particle size distributions determined by NTA
is not reliable.20 Therefore, a fitting
analysis with a γ distribution determined by the shape and scaling
parameters was proposed.20 Other methods
to analyze aggregation have also been proposed. For example, it has
been reported that electrospray-differential mobility analysis with
single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ES-DMA-spICPMS)
can be used to measure both the size and mass of particles independently
and simultaneously to quantify the degree of particle aggregation.21 In addition, a method has been proposed to prevent
erroneous measurement due to aggregation by measuring the ultraviolet
absorption of samples separated by field-flow fractionation (FFF).22 However, the above methods are complex and require
specialized training. Therefore, in the present study, we adopted
a simple NTA method to evaluate degradation and aggregation. This
involved a comparison of the number of accumulated particles by dividing
the area into areas smaller and larger than the particle size distribution
range before agitation.

In this work, which focuses on the physical
degradation of nanosized
PS from microplastics generated during agitation in aqueous solution,
the influence of agitation is comprehensively investigated by agitating
PS microplastics dispersed in water using three methods including
rotation mixing, shaking, and flowing. Samples allowed to stand without
agitation were also evaluated. In addition, the effects of liquid
volume, rotation speed, and flow rate were investigated. As a result,
an optimal agitation method and conditions that enabled physical degradation
experiments of PS microplastics in the laboratory with appropriate
particle size control are reported.

Results
To confirm
the presence or absence of microplastic degradation
and aggregation simply by the particle size, it is necessary to use
an initial particle sample that is monodisperse. Therefore, PS latex
particles (average particle size = 204.0 ± 2.1 nm, National Metrology
Institute of Japan, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
and Technology), which are used as a certified reference material
570-a for calibration of NTA equipment, were chosen. As confirmed
in Figures 1a and 2a, the average particle size of the PS particles
measured five times by NTA was 195.9 ± 1.2 nm, and the field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image showed that the
PS particles were spherical with relatively uniform particle size.

Standing without Agitation
A peak due to aggregation
measured by various particle size distribution measurements may appear
at the same position as a similar size large spherical particle.23 Furthermore, if the aggregation state varies,
the reproducibility of the peak position also deteriorates. Therefore,
as shown in Figure 1a, the accumulated number of particles calculated by NTA in the particle
size range 10–600 nm was divided by the total number of particles
and plotted as a percentage in relation to the right axis of the NTA
data. Excluding the 150–350 nm range, the particle size range
50–150 nm, which was physically degraded during agitation and
became smaller, was defined as “Area 1”, and the apparent
particle size that increased owing to aggregation in the range 350–600
nm was indicated “Area 2”. The average particle size
of the PS particles before agitation calculated by NTA was 195.9 ±
1.2 nm. Figure 1b shows
the particle size distribution after resting 0.5 mL of PS particle
dispersed water for 7 days in a microtube. Before standing, PS particles
showed good reproducibility and a sharp trace. As shown in Figure S1a-1 of the Supporting Information, the
measurements also showed good reproducibility after standing; however,
the width of the peak was slightly broadened. Figure 2b shows the appearance of PS particles observed
by FE-SEM. The shape remained spherical when compared with the PS
particles before standing, as shown in Figure S2a-1 of the Supporting Information. At first glance, it appears
that large-scale aggregation occurs in the particles after standing,
however, this is a well-known phenomenon of the aggregation of particles
caused by the drying of the suspension.20 The results of NTA measurements and FE-SEM observation when the
liquid volume of the PS particle dispersion was changed to 0.5, 0.75,
and 1 mL while using a 1.5 mL microtube are summarized in Figures S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information,
respectively. Based on the particle size distribution data measured
by NTA—performed five times in a row—accumulated numbers
of particles in Areas 1 and 2 were calculated (Figure 3a,b) so that they could be compared before
and after agitation. The percentage of the particle number in Area
1 before standing was 0.2%, and the ratio of the particle number belonging
to Area 1 after standing was 0.2–4.5% owing to the difference
in liquid volume. It was confirmed that PS particles were not degraded
by simply standing in water. In addition, in Area 2, the percentage
of the particle number was 0.4–8%, and the concentration of
particles with a large diameter was slightly higher. However, in the
case of the samples allowed to stand, the difference in volume did
not appear to significantly affect the aggregation of the particles.

of integrated number of PS particles in (a) Area
1 and (b) Area 2 against the total number of PS particles dispersed
in 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mL of ultrapure deionized water estimated by NTA
after incubation without agitation at 23 °C.

Rotation Mixing
Figure 1c shows the results of NTA measurement after rotation
mixing of PS particles dispersed in water at 23 °C for 7 days
at a rotation speed of 5 rpm. It can be confirmed that multiple peaks
appear in the distribution. From the FE-SEM image in Figure 2c, it can be observed that
the particles are generally nonspherical and that the sample contains
many particles of relatively small size. Therefore, the diameter obtained
from the NTA data of the PS particles after agitation is not the true
diameter of these particles but that of spherical particles that have
the same diffusion coefficient as the tracked particles. Based on
the findings shown in Figure S3 of the
Supporting Information, the effect of changing the speed of rotation
to 5, 10, and 15 rpm when the liquid volume of the sample was 0.5
or 0.75 mL was small. However, when the liquid volume was increased
to 1 mL, particles with a diameter of 400 nm or more were not detected,
and when the rotation speed was 5 rpm, the average particle diameter
was ∼182 nm, which supports a reduction in aggregation. However,
it is understood from Figure S3 of the Supporting Information that
although the PS particles appear rounded after rotation mixing, the
shape is not a well-balanced sphere but distorted. The ratio of the
particle number in Area 1 shown in Figure 4a increased with the liquid volume regardless
of the rotation speed, except for the case where the liquid volume
was 1 mL and the rotation speed was 10 rpm, which gave a ratio of
97%. In contrast, the proportion of particles present in Area 2 was
19% when the liquid volume was 0.75 mL and the rotation speed was
5 rpm, however, it was suppressed to a maximum of 4.4% or less under
other conditions. These results indicated that agitating PS particles
by rotating degrades them to nanosize without aggregation.

1 and (b) Area 2 against total number of PS particles dispersed in
0.5, 0.75, and 1 mL of ultrapure deionized water estimated by NTA
after incubation by rotating at a speed of 5, 10, or 15 rpm at a temperature
of 23 °C.

Shaking
Figures 1d and 2d show the results of shaking
the PS particles dispersed in water (volume 0.5 mL) at 200 rpm, which
is the minimum rotation speed that can be set by the block bath shaker
used in this study. NTA measurement gave an average particle size
of 182.5 ± 6.7 nm, and the peak shape was symmetrical. However,
as is shown in Figures S4 and S5 of the
Supporting Information, as the liquid volume increased to 0.75 and
1 mL, the NTA distribution also approached the shape of a single peak,
and the particle shape remained spherical. In addition, the FE-SEM
image showed generally larger particle sizes, however, the angular
shape was similar to that of PS particles after rotation mixing. On
the other hand, the number of particles classified as Area 1 shown
in Figure 5 was 4%
or less under most agitation conditions, which is relatively good
in numerical terms. However, when the amount of liquid was 0.5 mL
and the rotation speed of the block bath shaker was increased from
200 to 600 rpm, the number of particles classified as Area 1 rapidly
increased from 14 to 53%, indicating that the degradation of the PS
particles had occurred. In contrast, Area 2 caused by aggregation
showed a maximum value of 19% when the liquid volume was 0.5 mL and
the rotation speed was 600 rpm, and the suppression of aggregation
by shaking was diminished at this speed.

number of PS particles in (a) Area
1 and (b) Area 2 against total number of PS particles dispersed in
0.5, 0.75, and 1 mL of ultrapure deionized water estimated by NTA
after incubation with shaking at rotation speeds of 200, 400, and
600 rpm at a temperature of 23 °C.

Flowing
Finally, the NTA measurement and FE-SEM observation
results after circulating 0.5 mL of PS particles dispersed in water
for 7 days in an ethylene tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) tube at 0.05
mL/min—the minimum settable flow rate of the tubing pump used—are
shown in Figures 1e
and 2e, respectively. Figures 1f and 2f show the
results of agitating PS particles using an intelligent pump under
the same conditions. For both pumps, particles with an average particle
diameter of 200 nm or less were measured at a high concentration before
agitation. A small peak was also confirmed for diameters of 200 nm
or more. When an intelligent pump was used, a broad and relatively
strong peak appeared in the particle size range 250–500 nm.
In addition, the FE-SEM image supports the presence of a mixture of
particles with a diameter of approximately 170 nm (indicated by arrow
A in the figure) and 580 nm (indicated by arrow B in the figure).
However, the image also shows that these particles are spherical in
shape with a smooth surface compared with PS particles after rotation
mixing or shaking. In contrast, in Figure 2f, a square structure (indicated by arrows
C and D in the figure, respectively) with square side lengths of roughly
450 and 500 nm were observed. More rectangular structures with lengths
of 200 nm to 2.5 μm were observed; however, no correlation with
the flow rate of the intelligent pump was found. Roughly estimated,
a single square structure was observed per 2–5 μm2 area. The NTA measurement results for samples for which the
incubation flow rate was 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mL/min, while the liquid
volume of the sample was fixed at 0.5 mL, are shown in Figure S6 of the Supporting Information. In most
conditions, the tendency for the number of particles with small particle
size to be greater than the number of large particles is consistent
with the numerical change in the ratio of the particles with respect
to the total number, as shown in Figure 6. Although the percentage of particle number
in Area 1 appears to decrease from 84% to around 50% with increasing
flow rate, the FE-SEM observation results in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information show that the spherical shape
was not maintained as the flow rate was increased and the shape became
distorted. In addition, a large number of small fragments was observed.
The ratio of particle number in Area 2 against the total was 17% at
the maximum when the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min and 11% or less at other
flow rates. In contrast, as shown in Figure S8, there was no significant change in the NTA distribution shape due
to an increase in flow rate, even when the liquid was fed by the intelligent
pump. In fact, the particle number ratio of Area 1 shown in Figure 6 was also stable
in the range 41–46%, and in the case of Area 2, it changed
from 21 to 5% as the flow rate increased.

number of PS particles in (a) Area
1 and (b) Area 2 against total number of PS particles dispersed in

of 23 °C using tubing or intelligent pumps.

DSC Measurement
There is tacticity in the structure
of PS. Because isotactic PS, in which all asymmetric carbons have
the same absolute configuration, and syndiotactic PS, in which absolute
configurations are alternately arranged, have regular structures,
a crystal structure exists, and a melting point (Tm) can be measured. The melting points of the crystalline
PSs described are approximately 240 and 270 °C, respectively.24 In contrast, a structure in which the absolute
configuration is irregular is called atactic PS. Atactic PS does not
have a crystal structure and therefore has no melting point. Atactic
PS is used in large quantities as a general-purpose plastic. The DSC
measurement results shown in Figure 7 show an endothermic peak accompanying melting at around
274 °C. Based on this observation, the PS used in this experiment
is believed to have contained syndiotactic PS. However, because the
glass transition temperature (Tg) appears
in the vicinity of 106 °C, which is higher than that of syndiotactic
PS, there is a possibility that atactic PS with a rough molecular
weight of 2 × 105 g/mol was also present.24 However, as the PS latex particles are believed
to contain crystalline PS, the reasoning that links the square structure
shown in Figures 2f
and S9 with the recrystallization of PS
is thought to be valid.

Discussion
The aggregation and dispersion
behavior of particles in a suspension
strongly influences the particle size. Therefore, it is useful to
understand the agitation conditions under which the particles are
dispersed and agglomerated. Therefore, investigating the aggregation
of PS particles dispersed in water is a valid approach for understanding
the degradation process from microplastics to nanoplastics. In addition,
since particles are usually much larger than single molecules, they
are generally insoluble in solvents and infusible and nonsublimable,
and therefore, once they are aggregated, it is difficult to separate
them using a uniform method (e.g., ultrasonication, grinding). Therefore,
incubating samples while agitating using a method that suppresses
aggregation is important for determining the exact biochemical degradation
rate from microplastics to nanoparticles.

An initial finding
showed that PS particles were aggregated after
7 days of storing the dispersion without agitation. Although this
tendency was alleviated when the liquid volume of the sample was large,
this finding suggested that some kind of agitation should be applied.
Of the three agitation methods investigated, rotation mixing, shaking,
and flowing, shaking was found to be the most effective for preventing
aggregation of the particles. However, the shaking method also has
limitations, and in the case of small sample volumes or high rotation
speeds, aggregation was observed. In addition, an observation was
made that the size of the PS particles decreased after agitation.
Since PS [(C3H8)n] has no OH group, it is not solvated by H2O. Therefore,
reductions in the PS particle size are not attributed to chemical
decomposition but considered to be a result of physical damage to
the particles during agitation. This physical damage effect was particularly
observed in the case where the PS particles were circulated in an
ETFE tube using a tubing pump. The effect can be likened to the observation
in the natural world that many small, round stones are found downstream
of the river and large, angular stones are often found upstream. This
is because while the upstream stones are carried downstream by the
river water flowing at a constant flow velocity, the stones collide
with each other and with the riverbed, and the stones become separated
or broken, their sizes are reduced, and the corners of the stones
become rounded. Because of this, the small fragments that occur are
deposited as sand and mud at the bottom of the river.25 In the case of PS particles after flowing at relatively
high flow rates (Figure S7c,d of the Supporting
Information), it is possible to observe PS fragments that look like
haze. Furthermore, in the case of using a tubing pump, which is often
used as an artificial heart, there is also the possibility of causing
particle breakage due to the so-called cavitation in which bubbles
are generated and annihilated in a short time due to a pressure difference
in the flow of liquid samples flowing in the tube as the roller rotates.26 Furthermore, when the liquid is fed by a linear
driving pump with low pulsation, the cuboid structure observed by
FE-SEM could be recrystallized PS. This means that PS particles were
dissolved by ultrapure deionized water.

In the case of rotation
mixing, when a microtube set on the disk-shaped
holder approaches the top of the rotational movement, agitation accompanies
a dynamic fall of the liquid sample in the microtube, which is orientated
upside down, due to gravity. Such agitation, which is periodic but
not constant in flow velocity, resembles a scenario in which stones
are scraped as the waves are pushed and pulled on the shore. In fact, Figure S3 of the Supporting Information shows
that once aggregated, particles are scraped off without separation,
and as a result, they are observed as large, distorted shaped particles.
Particle splitting due to external forces is most easily explained
by shearing in the fluid. There are two cases in which this can occur.
In the first case, splitting is due to shear stress in the fluid.
The effect is small if the solvent has a low viscosity; however, if
the flow rate is sufficiently high, the impact force per unit length
can be increased. The second case involves solid–solid shearing
between the particles and the walls of the container or tube. The
contact surface areas of a 1.5 mL microtube and an ETFE tube with
an inner diameter of 0.8 mm filled with 1 mL of water are roughly
500 and 5000 mm2, respectively. Therefore, the degradation
of PS particles proceeds more efficiently in the continuous fluid
in the ETFE tube than during agitation in the microtube. In this way,
when the degradation process from microplastics to nanoplastics was
investigated, the result depended greatly on the agitation method
and conditions, and therefore, agitation conditions that can reproduce
the exposure environment of particles must be selected as accurately
as possible.

Conclusions
To understand the degradation
process of PS microplastics to nanoplastics,
the effects of four agitation methods including rotation mixing, shaking,
flowing, and standing without agitation were compared by focusing
on the decomposition and aggregation of PS particles dispersed in
ultrapure deionized water. The degree of degradation and aggregation
was evaluated by NTA measurements, and the degree of physical abrasion,
leading to changes in particle shape, was assessed by FE-SEM observation.
As a result, it was found that shaking prevented the aggregation and
the physical damage of particles. However, the shaking method did
have limitations depending on the agitation conditions. It was shown
experimentally that aggregation suppression requires sufficient sample
volume and that the lower the rotation speed, the more the aggregation
of the particles can be suppressed. For rotation mixing, a relatively
good aggregation reduction was only obtained for PS particles when
the sample volume was 1 mL and the rotation speed was 5 rpm. When
evaluating the biochemical degradability of particles in a solvent,
shaking is the most gentle and suitable method for agitating particles;
however, if physical degradability is of interest, flowing could be
the most suitable method. In addition, it is possible that agitation
by rotation mixing would be the most balanced method for evaluating
the biochemical and physical degradabilities simultaneously. Therefore,
it is necessary to select an appropriate agitation method and conditions
depending on the natural environment degradation of PS microplastics
to nanoplastics that is being simulated. The results of our experiments
suggest that it is necessary to discuss plastic waste contamination
in the marine environment not only from micro-to-nano-size degradation
but also from recrystallization following degradation.

Experimental
Section
NTA Measurements and FE-SEM Observation
The degree
of aggregation of the particles before and after agitation was determined
from the particle size distribution measured by NTA. A NanoSight LM10
(Malvern Panalytical) with a high-sensitivity complementary metal-oxide
semiconductor (CMOS) camera was used for this measurement. The official
detectable particle size by the manufacturer is 50–1000 nm
for measurements of PS particles. The liquid sample containing the
particles was drawn up in a 1 mL syringe and fed into the measuring
cell via an ETFE tube with an internal diameter of 0.8 mm and outer
diameter of 1.58 mm at a flow rate of approximately 16.6 μL/min
(infusion rate = 75 on the control software of NanoSight LM10) using
a NanoSight dedicated syringe pump NTA1014. For NTA measurement, in
order for the 642 nm laser with a width of 50 μm to cross the
inside of the liquid feeding cell obliquely, roughly 70% or more of
the measuring cell must be filled with the liquid sample. Therefore,
the minimum liquid volume of the sample required for NTA measurement
was 0.5 mL. The NTA measurement settings are as follows: trace count
= 5, single trace time = 60 s, camera level = 8–16, and detection
threshold = 5. For all samples after agitation, the number of particles
tracked during NTA measurement is listed in the second column from
the right in Table 1. Samples were not diluted after agitation; however, if PS particles
are significantly degraded or aggregated, the number of particles
tracked will be smaller. As the number of particles tracked decreases,
stochastic peaks are more likely to appear in the NTA data. S-4800
FE-SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies) was used to observe the shape of
the particles. A 5 μL sample containing particles was dropped
onto a 15 mm × 15 mm × 0.525 mm Si substrate using a micropipette
and after being allowed to dry naturally for 1 h was inserted into
the FE-SEM main chamber without coating the surface with a conductive
material. The Si substrate, cut into 15 mm squares from a 4 in. Si
wafer with a thickness of 0.525 mm by laser dicing, was ultrasonically
cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, then washed
with pure water for 5 min, and dried using a stream of N2 gas. For FE-SEM observation, the acceleration voltage and the working
distance were fixed at 5 kV and 8 mm, respectively, for all samples.

Preparation of Particle
Suspension
The samples for
FE-SEM observation were acquired by dropping each particle dispersion
onto a 200-nm-thick Au/15-nm-thick Cr/525-μm-thick Si substrate.
Since NanoSight LM10 recommends 107–109 particles/mL as the appropriate concentration for NTA measurements,
the purchased PS particle suspension was diluted with ultrapure deionized
water (resistivity = 18.2 MΩ·cm) 8 × 106 times and then dispersed by pipetting 50 times. It should be noted
that some physically damaged PS particles were observed by FE-SEM
when vortex mixing was used for 1 min or more in this dispersion step.
Therefore, only pipetting was used to homogenize the dispersion.

Particle Incubation with Agitation
The incubation temperature
and time were chosen as 23 °C and 7 days, respectively. In the
aggregation tests, we compared three methods: rotation mixing, shaking,
and flowing. In addition, a sample was also prepared that was left
to stand in a microtube holder without agitation (Figure 8a). The conditions for each
agitation method are summarized in Table 1. Samples other than those agitated by flow
were injected into a 1.5 mL microtube using a micropipette. Three
different liquid volumes were evaluated, 0.5, 0.75, and 1 mL. For
rotation mixing, the dedicated holder RVM-MT20 was fixed to a small
rotation mixer RVM-101 (Sanyo) so that the rotation surface faced
vertically, and the rotation speed was set to 5, 10, or 15 rpm. The
rotation mixer was placed in a mini incubator MI-100G (Yonezawa) to
maintain a constant temperature of 23 °C (Figure 8b). For shaking, a dedicated block C-100
was used with a block bath shaker MyBL-100CS (Matsuura Seisakusyo),
the temperature was set to 23 °C, and samples in microtubes were
shaken at rotation speeds of 200 (minimum settable value), 400, and
600 rpm (Figure 8c).
For agitation by flow, a tubing pump with relatively large pulsation
and an intelligent pump for high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), which suppressed pulsation by linear driving, were compared.
A digital metering tubing pump DSP-100SA (Asone) was used with an
ETFE tube with an inner diameter of 0.8 mm and an outer diameter of
1.58 mm and a tube joint JHE312 (Eyela) with an inner diameter of
1.2 mm and a silicon tube with an outer diameter of 4.2 mm and an
inner diameter of 2.15 mm. The silicon tube was connected to both
ends of the custom tube cartridge L stored in the tubing pump. In
the intelligent pump case, an ETFE tube with an inner diameter of
0.8 mm and an outer diameter of 1.58 mm was connected to a polyether
ether ketone (PEEK) head of an intelligent pump UI-22-110 (Flom) via
a tube joint JHE312 (Eyela) with an inner diameter of 1.2 mm and a
ferrule integrated set screw TC-15 (Eyela) with an inner diameter
of 1.58 mm. In both cases, after the ETFE tube and the silicon tube
were filled with 1.5 mL of ultrapure deionized water, the ETFE tube
was cut to length to give the same volume as the 1.5 mL microtube.
The flow rate of the liquid sample from both pumps was set to either
0.05 (minimum settable value), 0.1, 0.5, or 1 mL/min. The volume of
the sample inserted into the tube was 0.5 mL. The injection and removal
of the sample into and out of the tube was performed using a 1 mL
syringe via a manual three-way valve VF-5310 (Eyela) provided in the
middle of the ETFE tube. The temperature during agitation for the
standing and flowing samples was maintained at 23 °C using the
laboratory air conditioner running for 24 h (Figure 8d).

water: (a) standing
without agitation, (b) rotation mixing, (c) shaking, and (d) flowing.

Sample Preparation for DSC Measurement
The PS latex
particles used were subjected to DSC measurement over the temperature
range 50–300 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C/min using
a DSC-60 Plus instrument (Shimadzu). PS latex particles that had been
naturally dried by evaporating the solvent were placed in a dedicated
Al crimp pan, covered with an Al lid, and then sealed by pressing.
α-Alumina was used as a reference sample for the DSC measurement.
