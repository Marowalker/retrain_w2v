A series
of poly(tetrahydrofuran)s with molecular weights above
entanglement molecular weight Me were
synthesized, and one of their end-groups was functionalized with a
supramolecular entity so that the corresponding polymers form a brushlike
structure suitable for comparison with conventional irreversible bottlebrush
polymers. To compare their relaxation mechanisms, linear rheology
was employed and showed that a hierarchical relaxation, which is usually
observed in bottlebrush polymers, occurs in these materials, too.
The polymer chain segments close to the supramolecular backbone are
highly immobilized due to strong association in the center of polymer
brush and cannot relax via reptation mechanism, which is mainly responsible
for linear entangled polymer relaxations. Therefore, disentanglement
can take much longer through contour length fluctuations and arm retraction
processes similar to covalent bottlebrush polymers and combs. The
relaxed ends of polymers then act as solvent to let the remaining
segments of the polymeric brush undergo Rouse-like motions (constraint
release Rouse). At longer times, additional plateau appears, which
can be attributed to the relaxation of the entire supramolecular bottlebrush
polymer via hopping or reptative motions. With an increase of temperature,
viscoelastic solid behavior turns into viscoelastic liquid due to
reversible depolymerization of the supramolecular backbone of the
bottlebrush polymer. The elastic modulus (G′
in the order of kPa) was much less than the values found for the entanglement
plateau modulus of linear poly(tetrahydrofuran) (in order of MPa).
This low modulus value, which exists up to very low frequencies (high
temperatures), makes them a good candidate for supersoft elastomers.

Introduction
The rheological properties
of polymers are governed by dynamics
at the molecular level. By introducing topological constrains to the
polymeric chains, relaxation mechanism within different segments of
the chains in different time scales can be altered. Vlassopoulos,1−4 McLeish,5−10 and Larson11,12 extensively studied brush/comb/star
polymer dynamics. The dynamics of these systems are generally described
by a hierarchical relaxation process, in which the segments furthest
from the backbone relax first while the internal segments near branch
points relax at later times within a solvated tube.13

The main interest concerning star polymers is the
topological constraint
they “feel” in the melt state. By changing the length
and number of arms, bulk properties can vary from a typical linear
polymer to colloidal materials.3,14,15 When the length of the polymers is large enough, the topological
constraints of the surrounding chains (entanglement) confine a chain
within a so-called tube.16 On the other
hand, if the number of arms is high enough (hyperstars), the star
polymers can behave as colloidal hard spheres which are constrained
by their neighbors and form a glasslike material in the sense that
they are not ordered (nor cross-linked) but do not flow. These materials
are totally a different class of polymers compared to glassy polymers
whose glass-transition temperature prevents them from flowing at certain
temperatures. In this system, the topological constraint is the cage
of surrounding particles that limits the motion of each star to scales
smaller than its size, and therefore no macroscopic motion can be
observed.3,14,15

In this
study, we investigate the effect of additional dynamic
feature, namely, association/dissociation of multiple H-bonding groups
(sticker), in the dynamics of polymer brushes. The only study on polymer
combs with noncovalent main-chain/side-chain interactions used thymine/diaminotriazine
moieties randomly distributed along the main chain.17−19 However, the
disadvantages of this system are: (1) random distribution of junction
points, which can affect the relaxation of supramolecular polymers
via broader relaxation times, (2) weak H-bonding, which does not have
a long lifetime, (3) the fact that despite heteroassociation of thymine
and diaminotriazine moieties, the homoassociation and aggregations
can be significant,20 and (4) using few
stickers along the chain, only a comb morphology can be obtained,
whereas to deviate from linear polymer dynamics, more side chains
are more effective for a hierarchical relaxation. But for more side
chains to associate (to compete with the steric hindrance), a sticker
capable of strong stacking/H-bonding is needed. Therefore, to tackle
these problems, a novel sticker was synthesized and added to one end
of a model polymer with low critical molecular weight Mc (=2500 g mol–1)21 so it can be highly entangled while having low molecular
weight (important for end-group functionalization) and with medium
polarity so that sticker dynamics can be incorporated in entangled
polymer dynamics in a brushlike fashion. It is important to note that
in this study, the goal was to investigate an entangled polymer with
one sticker as the end-group. The presence of two stickers or more
can lead to the formation of transient networks that have entirely
different viscoelastic properties, which has been studied extensively
in the past.22−24

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Poly(tetrahydrofuran)s
(PTHFs) (1a–d)
Synthesis
of different molecular
weights of PTHFs (1a–d) having only
one hydroxyl group was inspired by the works of Croucher, Thompson,
and co-workers.25−27 Silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF4) or equivalently
silver hexafluorophosphate (AgPF6) can be used as a catalyst,
and when added to acryloyl chloride can generate a cationic initiator.
The initiation rate depends on the precipitation rate of the formed
AgCl and in all cases was less than 30 s at room temperature, leading
to a fast initiation suitable for living polymerization. Gram-scale
synthesis can be carried out to yield PTHFs with high molecular weights
and narrow dispersity (Scheme 1 and Table 1). The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) traces (Figure S1) show four different PTHF molecular weights proving
that the synthesized polymers have low-molecular-weight distributions. 1H NMR proves the successful formation of PTHF (1a–d) bearing one hydroxyl group originating from
quenching with water and the other end bearing the acrylate from the
initiator (Figure S2). PTHF was used due
to its low glass-transition temperature (Tg ≈ −86 °C)22,28 and fast dynamics above
melting point (Tm ≈ 30 °C, Figure S11) in the range of the studied molecular
weights (≫critical molecular weight Mc ≈ 2500 g mol–1).21 The medium polarity of PTHF is also particularly interesting
as even weak H-bonding moieties (weak stickers) can associate strongly
in a nonpolar matrix like polyisobutylene.29

Also, we investigated the polymerizability
of acrylate end-group
and no conversion occurred, proving that the functionality stays intact
due to steric hindrance and low concentration of end-groups in such
molecular weights. In the future, new methods will be reported on
how to polymerize this end-group to form bottlebrush polymers with
stickers at the free ends.

Self-Assembly Studies
To introduce
end-groups that
can efficiently self-assemble, both the strength of the sticker and
more importantly its ability to undergo phase segregation are proved
to be crucial.22 To obtain an array of
associated end-groups resembling a backbone of polymer brushes, the
goal is more than just a binary association of stickers; long-range,
well-defined association as well as aggregation has to be achieved.
Therefore, we decided to synthesize a sticker that can self-assemble
in large scales using six H-bondings, two of which are bifurcated.
Moreover, the aromatic ring(s) can undergo π–π
stacking, which can help the long-range aggregation of stickers. The
trivial, gram-scale synthesis of compound 2 (1-(6-Isocyanatohexyl)-3-(7-oxo-7,8-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)urea)
(ODIN) makes it a strong candidate for supramolecular
chemistry (compound 2 in Scheme 1). The most remarkable character of this
sticker compared to the well-known ureido-pyrimidinone (UPy) is its
better phase separation ability that induces long-ranged stacked layers
needed for a brush backbone, whereas UPy without a urea group attached
to it only partially aggregates, as will be discussed in detail in
this article.30 However, the association
of ODIN is not necessarily trivial, as it is the case
for many H-bonding systems in which urea groups are involved.31−34 A few primary mechanistic questions can be raised concerning the
designed sticker: (i) can the heterocyclic urea be folded by an intramolecular
H-bonding? (ii) if so, how can it affect the association and dimerization?
(iii) which tautomeric form is more stable (Figure 1)? (iv) how can this sticker influence the
properties of a model polymer in the melt state when attached to only
one end of the polymeric chain? In the following, we strive to provide
convincing answers to these questions.

(PCM), chloroform] showing tautomerization, intramolecular H-bonding
formation, and dimerization energies. Energy (stability) levels decrease
(increase) from top to bottom.

Sticker 2 was coupled to one end-group of PTHFs 1a–d so that the association can be studied
in a polymeric system. Figures S3 and S4 depict the 1H NMR spectra of 2 and 3, respectively. The downfield chemical shift of protons adjacent
to the hydroxyl group of 1 as well as appearance of protons
corresponding to 2 proves the addition of the sticker
to one end-group of the PTHF. Moreover, the broad urethane proton
at 4.76 ppm substantiates the coupling. The degree of coupling is
calculated roughly to be around 70% (depending on which proton is
considered), which is satisfactory for such high PTHF molecular weights
(>11.0 kg mol–1).

To answer the first question, 1H NMR was used to check
whether breaking of intermolecular H-bonding using a strong hydrogen-bond
acceptor such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can isolate the stickers
from a dimerized state in chloroform (Figure 2). In a very low ratio of DMSO/chloroform,
the 1H NMR (only the downfield section of the spectra is
illustrated) shows two protons at very high ppm values (>11 ppm).
This indicates that the aromatic N–H (proton assigned with
purple) and urea proton adjacent to the aromatic ring (light blue)
are involved in strong H-bondings. The third proton (red) is however
shifted relatively upfield. The four aromatic peaks are all duplets,
and the coupling constants prove the correct assignment of these protons.
By increasing the DMSO content to only 0.08%, an upfield shift in
the strongly hydrogen-bonded protons (assigned with purple and light
blue) arises. Moreover, these peaks broaden and at 0.8% DMSO, all
NH protons are coalesced, indicating the equilibrium between the monomeric
and dimeric forms of 2 in the NMR timescale.

Figure 2 1H NMR titration of 2 in chloroform-d with DMSO-d6 as the guest
compound.

However, more interesting is the
upfield shift and coalescence
of the aromatic proton adjacent to the urea carbonyl (dark blue).
This shows that 2 in its dimeric form has a weak C–H···O=C
hydrogen bond that can solidify the conformational form (Figure 1) and prevent it
from rotating to create the forms with intramolecular N–H···N
H-bonding. Although this effect is relatively weak, intermolecular
or intramolecular H-bonding of C–H···N/O has
been reported earlier.34,35 The change in the chemical shift
(8.19–6.83 ppm) of the aromatic proton in the proximity of
O=C (dark blue) is also induced due to an anisotropic deshielding
cone of O=C in full agreement with similar heterocyclic ureas.33,34,36 This interaction is more probable
in the case of the hydrogen-bonded dimer in which rotation is limited
due to six hydrogen bonds with the other monomer. Therefore, when
the intermolecular H-bonding is broken, the rotation occurs implying
that in the monomeric form, keto tautomer is more stable, whereas
the keto dimer is a stable conformation when the two stickers are
in close proximity to each other, in nonpolar solvents or the melt
state. In the keto monomer, the formed six-membered ring is strongly
rigid, creating three six-membered rings adjacent to each other. The
very strong intramolecular H-bonding formed in the keto monomer is
also observable from deshielding of the urea proton (noted with red
color) from 5.93 to 8.98 ppm. This peak was coalesced in the intermediate
concentrations of DMSO (0.08–2.5%) indicating the “pathway”
to the corresponding the keto monomer conformation while being in
equilibrium with the monomeric form with no intramolecular N–H···N
H-bonding. Moreover, the sharpening and appearance of a weak triplet
(Figure S5) indicates the coupling of N–H
(red) and adjacent CH2 protons in the formed rigid structure
and that the N–H proton (red) is not in equilibrium or exchange
with other molecules. This phenomenon does not occur in the intermolecularly
hydrogen-bonded protons as a broad singlet can be seen (1H NMR in pure chloroform, Figure S3).
Moreover, by increasing the DMSO contents, three of the aromatic protons
(green, yellow, and black) have a slight upfield shift, showing the
π–π stacking is broken by the presence of DMSO
molecules. They also start to sharpen with addition of DMSO, which
shows that the broadness of the aromatic peaks can originate from
stacking.37 The trend in the upfield shift
for the protons is indicated by green and yellow but stops at 6.7%
DMSO probably due to the countereffect of intramolecular H-bonding
formation. The slight shift of the spectrum when comparing 8.3–100%
DMSO concentrations is due to the electric field and magnetic anisotropy
of DMSO as a solvent, which affects all protons equally.38

At higher concentrations of DMSO, some
traces of other conformers
are also present. From the two very weak peaks at 10–12 ppm,
they can be assigned to keto monomer with no intramolecular N–H···N
H-bonding. Also, the aromatic protons exist at 6.4–8.2 ppm.
Using the aromatic protons for the integration, roughly 20% of this
conformer is still present in pure DMSO. To summarize, the keto monomer
with intramolecular H-bonding is built via first breaking the intermolecular
hydrogen bond and the π–π stacking and then breaking
the weak intramolecular C–H···O=C hydrogen
bond and the subsequent rotation to form a stronger N–H···N
bond.

The stability of the formed H-bonding depends on many
factors including
the strength and the number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds,39 secondary interactions (SIs),40 steric effects, and competition with solvent molecules.41 Also, according to Etter’s rules, intramolecular
H-bonding is generally stronger than the intermolecular one.42 For sticker 2, if the weak intramolecular
C–H···O=C interaction is ignored, the
number of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the dimer is rather
high (6). Moreover, the SIs can play an important role in the association
as in the DDADAA array, N:O and N:N are repulsive. This is in fact
consistent with the calculated dimerization constant (Kdim ≈ 20 000 M–1) of this
moiety in chloroform. Unfortunately, due to the low solubility of
this compound, accurate dilution experiments were not possible; therefore, Kdim was measured after coupling to the PTHF
chain end according to the previously reported 1H NMR integration
method of Meijer et al. and using the aromatic proton (dark blue),
which can form weak H-bonding over any other aromatic integrals (see Supporting Information).43 This value is fairly consistent with the values reported for similar
stickers (Kdim ≈ 40 000
M–1).44 Therefore, the
violation of Etter’s rule (six intermolecular H-bonding is
preferred over one intramolecular one) occurs with the expense of
dimerization constant.34

So far, 1H NMR showed the presence of dominantly keto
forms. However, the absence of enol monomer and dimer is still dubious.
To have a deeper insight into the stability in different conformers,
electronic structure calculations at the density functional level
of theory, density functional theory (DFT) (omega B97X-D functional/cc-PVDZ
basis set), was used to evaluate the molecular structures, dimerization
energies (Edim), and the energetics of
different conformers. Calculations were conducted in both vacuum and
chloroform using polarizable continuum model (PCM).

Figure 1 shows the
energy profiles and corresponding structures of different tautomers
(the stability increases from top to bottom). Enol monomer appeared
to be the least stable one and tends to tautomerize into the keto
form. Even formation of an internal H-bond and a six-membered ring
does not suffice to induce much stability to this conformer. A DDAA-type
interaction, which is also responsible for UPy association, is not
the most favorable interaction, even though it has a high energy of
dimerization (Edim = −32.89 kcal
mol–1). The calculated Edim of UPy in the keto form (DDAA) is reported to be −41.76 kcal
mol–1.45 The lower Edim of enol dimer is mainly due to the secondary
interaction of the additional hydroxyl group, steric hindrance, and
lack of a strong intramolecular H-bonding. This leads to a deviation
from the planar geometry and formation of a distorted plane (Figure S6). As stated earlier, 1H
NMR showed that the weak C–H···O interaction
is partially responsible for the stability of monomeric forms without
internal strong H-bondong. Therefore, the energy required to break
the intramolecular hydrogen bond of 2 is much smaller
than expected (1.98 kcal mol–1). Nevertheless, consistent
with 1H NMR, when isolated from other partners, the most
stable tautomer is calculated to be the keto monomer. Finally, the
dimerization of keto form of 2 leads to a high Edim of −40.54 kcal mol–1, very close to UPy with Edim = −41.76
kcal mol–1. This is also consistent with our 1H NMR analysis showing that in the dimerized form in chloroform
(or in vacuum), keto form is the most stable dimer/conformer. This
value for similar naphthyridine-based compounds with DADA-type H-bonding
was only −16.55 to −23.58 kcal mol–1,36 implying that the bifurcated urea
hydrogen bond plays a significant role in the dimerization of 2.

Although, considering Edim, the H-bonding
interaction of UPy·UPy is slightly stronger than 2 (from Kdim, it is even more significant),
the enthalpy of stacking (the magnitude) is rather much higher in 2 (Estacking = −18.96 kcal
mol–1) than in UPy (Estacking = +4 kcal mol–1). Also, keto form of 2 in the dimerized form showed a very planar geometry (Figure 3) as opposed to the enol form.
However, probably due to the two aromatic rings present in enol, the
stacking is slightly stronger (Estacking in the enol form = −19.45 kcal mol–1).
The optimized stacked geometries can be seen in Figure S6.

Figure 3 Optimized structures of (a) dimeric and (b) monomeric
forms of 2 as the most stable conformers in the dimeric
and monomeric
states.

Also, the urea N–H close
to the alkyl spacer seems to be
pulled out of the stacking plane to form a hydrogen bond with C=O
of the stacked partner promoting the π–π stacking
(Figure S6). Therefore, the urea N–H
is not only involved in H-bonding in the dimerization but also in
the stacking, leading to a three-dimensional ordering. Another reason
for the high stacking ability of 2 can be attributed
to the intramolecular interactions CH···O, which can
extend π-conjugation by incorporating the H and C=O atoms
into the rings.46

Unfortunately,
single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) was not
possible due to low solubility of 2 preventing single-crystal
growth. However, in future work, we plan to improve the solubility
by alkyl chain extension to perform both SCXRD and 1H NMR
dilution experiments. Therefore, the bond distance and angles were
calculated theoretically at the DFT level of theory (Table S1 for calculations in chloroform and vacuum). Interestingly,
the bifurcated hydrogen bonds do not have similar bond lengths (3.02
vs 2.78 Å). This has been reported earlier in the case of dibutyltriurets47 and is consistent with the 1H NMR
assignments (Figure 2). The N–H bond close to the alkyl spacer appears at much
lower chemical shifts (5.93 ppm) than the one close to the aromatic
rings (11.22 ppm), showing that the strength of urea N–H H-bonding
adjacent to the rings is much higher and therefore prone to intramolecular
hydrogen bonds with bond length 2.74 Å if it is isolated from
its partner (see Figure 3). The weak hydrogen bond in C–H···O is although
relatively long (2.87 Å compared to 2.74 Å in the monomeric
meto form) still short enough (<3 Å) to stabilize this tautomer
via intramolecular interaction. The other two N–H···N
bonds in the center of ADADAD, on the other hand, appear to have short
bond lengths of 3.07 Å. The estimated values for UPy are 2.78–3.01
Å from ref (38) and 2.75–2.97 Å from our calculations showing the hydrogen-bond
length in UPy·UPy is comparable to that of dimer of 2 (2.78–3.07 Å). Also, the bond angles in the two middle
N–H···N were calculated to be 176° in comparison
to 178° for the two in UPy. Stacking distance for 2 was calculated to be 3.15 Å, which is quite smaller than the
one for UPy (3.56 Å) in ref (38). Using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) (Figure S13), the stacking distance was calculated
to be dπ–π = 3.49 Å,
which is again smaller than the UPy stacking distance measured by
XRD (3.55 Å).45

To get some
insight into the association of 2 in the
solid state, variable-temperature Fourier transform infrared (VT-FTIR)
spectroscopy was performed (Figure 4). The peaks at 2280 and 2800–3000 cm–1 belong to the isocyanate and alkyl groups, respectively. The absence
of any peaks above 3400 cm–1 indicates that almost
all of the N–H groups are hydrogen-bonded. Moreover, the peaks
at 3394, 3321, and 3226 cm–1 correspond to the free,
disordered hydrogen-bonded, and ordered hydrogen-bonded N–H.
The two peaks at lower wavenumbers are especially broad showing that
in terms of bond angle and length, a distribution of H-bonding patterns
is present. This is another proof of the theoretical simulation results
that the H-bonding in 2 is multidirectional. As discussed
earlier, the N–H proton is pulled out of the aromatic plane
to form another H-bonding N–H···O=C with
the stacked partner (Figure S6). Interestingly,
the peak at 3394 cm–1 gets stronger in intensity
by increasing the temperature whereas the peak assigned to the ordered
H-bonding (at 3226 cm–1) starts to lose its intensity
at 100 °C. At 1610, 1652, and 1712 cm–1, peaks
corresponding to the ordered, disordered hydrogen-bonded C=O,
and free C=O, respectively, show the same trend with temperature.
The peak at 1610 cm–1 starts to lose its intensity
at 100 °C whereas the one at 1712 cm–1 becomes
more intense as temperature increases. This shows that at lower temperatures,
part of the moieties are ordered, and this ordering gets weaker with
temperature, in particular with rise of temperature to 100 °C.
Another implication is that H-bonding assists the ordering and stacking
of 2. This is consistent with the observations for UPy
that stacking when combined with H-bonding increases Edim.45 The assignments were
also consistent with the plethora of studies done in the past for
urea groups.48−50

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
The high stacking
energy as well as small stacking distance obtained by DFT calculations
in conjunction with PXRD measurements indicates that 2 is a strong candidate for supramolecular aggregation of macromonomers.
The aggregation behavior of different molecular weights of PTHF with ODIN end-group (3a–d) was
studied by performing SAXS in the bulk phase. Figure 5 shows the SAXS profiles of 3a–d at different temperatures starting from room
temperature up to 120 °C. The samples were kept above Tm after annealing to avoid crystallization of
PTHF (see Supporting Information). All
investigated samples show clear scattering at small angles, indicative
of the presence of aggregates at the nanoscale.

Figure 5 SAXS profiles of supramolecular
polymers (a) 3a, (b) 3b, (c) 3c, and (d) 3d in the melt
state at temperatures 22, 50, 75, 100, and 120 °C.

Generally, the SAXS intensity decays in the log–log
plots
according to a power law of about q–2. Generally, for rodlike or fibrillar structures, a q–1 power law is observed. However, bundling and
further aggregation usually alters the slope of the SAXS intensity
in the log–log plot and can explain the q–2 intensity decay. Thus, we assume that H-bonding motif 2 tends to stack due to π–π stacking to
form elongated one-dimensional (1D) structures that tend to assemble
side to side (Figure 7). This kind of structure is generally observed for supramolecular
UPy systems.30 The packing between the
1D aggregates side to side is characterized by a characteristic separation
distance d*, which will depend on the molecular weight
of the polymer chains attached to the H-bonding motifs.

The
scattering profiles of samples 3a and 3b show three and two scattering peaks, respectively. Their relative
positions at q*, 2q*, and 3q* for 3a and q* and 2q* for 3b suggest a lamellar morphology with
periodicity distance d* = 2π/q* = 4 and 14 nm for 3a and 3b, respectively.
Samples 3c and 3d show only a single weak
and broad diffraction peak. As mentioned before, increasing molecular
weights is expected to cause an increase of d*. Indeed,
the scattering peak position shifts toward lower scattering angles
with increasing molecular weight, meaning that d*
becomes larger (Figure S12). However, when
plotting d* as a function of the molecular weight
(or the PTHF degree of polymerization), the expected d* ∝ Mw1/2 is not observed, and a power exponent of
0.8–1 is found. This would imply a significantly stretched
conformation of the polymer chains, a feature that will be discussed
below in view of the rheology data.

Furthermore, we have tested
the temperature stability of the supramolecular
aggregates by performing temperature-resolved SAXS (Figure 5). Increasing the temperature
to 75–100 °C causes significant weakening and often disappearance
of the scattering peaks for all samples, suggesting loss of molecular
order. This temperature range is significantly close to the dissociation
temperature estimated by FTIR. However, especially for the two samples
with higher molecular weight, the shape of the SAXS curve does not
change significantly upon dissociation although scattering features
become weaker. This could suggest that even if the H-bonding moieties
dissociate, phase separation is still present.

Melt Rheology
To understand the melt dynamics of supramolecular
bottlebrush polymers 3a–d, low-amplitude
shear rheology was performed in the linear viscoelastic (LVE) regime. Figure 6 shows the frequency
sweep measurements performed at different temperatures, starting from
40 °C up to the temperature at which the sample shows viscoelastic
liquid behavior or terminal regime; 40 °C was chosen as, at this
temperature, all samples are in the noncrystalline phase by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements (Figure S11). In Figure 6a–d, a significant complex thermorheological behavior prevents
the construction of mastercurves. This indicates that the dynamics
of 3 is governed by both the association of the end-group
and the chain dynamics.20Figure 6a shows a plateau with G′ > 10 kPa at 40 °C, which extends to low
frequencies.
This behavior is repeated at 60 °C from high to intermediate
frequencies, and at longer time, the flow regime appears. At higher
temperatures (>80 °C), the viscosity of the sample was too
small
to be measured accurately. For sample 3b (see Figure 6b), at low temperatures
(40–80 °C), a plateau is also observed (G′ > G″). At 80 °C, this plateau
becomes slightly lower, while at 100 °C, it disappears and a
viscoelastic liquid behavior (G′ < G″) is observed for the whole experimental frequency
window. The origin of this plateau is important to be investigated
as the reference PTHF polymer 1d shows liquidlike behavior
at all of these temperatures (>40 °C) as T ≫ Tg ≈ −86 °C
(Figure S8).22,28 Therefore,
the plateau does not
originate from the entanglements and is necessarily due to the contribution
of the end-groups aggregation. Besides, comparing to GN ≈ ρRT/Me≈ 1 MPa in the case of entangled linear PTHF,
the observed plateau is much lower. This confirms that a large fraction
of the sample has already relaxed at higher frequency outside the
experimental frequency window and that this plateau does not correspond
to the linear entangled PTHF. It has to be noted that the appearance
of a plateau at low frequency cannot be attributed to the formation
of a supramolecular network, as often observed with polymer chains
carrying supramolecular moieties as their two end-groups22,23,51 since samples 3a and 3b only have one functionalized end-group. Similar
behavior was observed for two higher molecular weights 3c and 3d in Figure 6c,d (detailed frequency sweeps can be seen in Figures S9 and S10 including all of the studied
temperatures). At T ≈ 100–120 °C,
the plateau at low frequencies disappears. Despite the similarities
between the two higher and the two lower molecular weights (3a/b vs 3c/d), there
is an important difference to be noted, at intermediate frequencies:
for 3c/d, G′, G″ ∝ ω0.5 for over two decades,
while they are constant for 3a/b. Thus,
depending on both molecular weight and temperature, three different
viscoelastic responses can be observed in the investigated frequency
range: (i) a solidlike response (G′ > G″) observed at low temperatures and often at low
frequency; (ii) a dissipative regime observed at high temperatures
(G′ < G″); and
(iii) a Rouse regime (with a power law ∼ω0.5) observed at high frequencies for the high-molecular-weight
samples.

for supramolecular polymers: (a) 3a, (b) 3b, (c) 3c, and (d) 3d at different temperatures
(>40 °C).

To show that the solidlike
property arises from aggregation of 2 moieties attached
to PTHF, a UPy-modified PTHF using 1d as precursor was
also synthesized (3e) (see Supporting Information). The frequency dependence
of complex viscosity at 40 °C for 3d and 3e is then studied, in comparison to the viscosity of the precursor 1d and to the one of a low-molecular-weight PTHF bearing hydroxyl
end-groups (as a control experiment) (Figure S8). The viscosity of 1d is over 2 orders of magnitude
higher than the low-molecular-weight PTHF. By using UPy, this value
increases even more, without increasing the polymer Mn. This increase in viscosity is indicative of a binary
association of 2 UPy end-groups leading to a longer PTHF 1d (around twice the length of 1d) or to the
presence of small aggregates of UPy groups. In this last case, self-assemblies
are formed, which relax as starlike molecules (thus, with negligible
influence of their small core). It is observed that in all cases except 3d, a Newtonian, frequency-independent behavior is observed
at low frequency, indicating that the terminal regime can be reached
for these samples. Moreover, the frequency sweep of 3e shows a dissipative behavior in the entire frequency range studied
(Figure S7). Thus, PTHFs 1 or 3e are liquidlike materials, despite their entangled
state (Table 1), due
to temperatures far above their Tg.22,28 This suggests that UPy, despite stronger dimerization ability, has
weaker aggregation and stacking properties than 2. It
can only produce longer chains, almost double size of its precursor 1d or assemblies obtained by the aggregation of a small number
of UPy groups. Samples 3a–d, on the
other hand, aggregate much more and form big brushlike objects, which
induce an additional rheological response and lead to the presence
of the low-frequency plateau observed in their storage modulus (see Figure 6): while it is expected
that the extremities of branches of the supramolecular polymer brushes
relax and disentangle at high frequency, their core, which is formed
by the aggregated ODIN groups as well as by a part of the PTHF branches
(close to the ODIN), needs much longer time to relax.

The difference
between ODIN and UPy is summarized
in Figure 7, which presents the proposed morphology of (a) supramolecular
bottlebrush polymers formed by the aggregation of the ODIN end-groups
(localized at one chain end) and (b) polymeric assemblies formed by
the aggregation of only few UPy groups (localized at one chain end).
For samples 3a–d, under an oscillatory
shear (within the linear viscoelastic regime; see Figure 6) applied to the samples, first,
the PTHF arms are expected to renew their orientations at a local
level (<Me) via Rouse-like motions
until they reach their entanglement plateau (outside the experimental
frequency window). This fast relaxation process should be followed
by partial disentanglement of the chains. It has to be noted that
at low temperatures, one side of the polymeric chains is fixed, which
prevents the reptative motion, which is the dominant mode of stress
relaxation in the linear monodisperse polymers. Therefore, disentanglement
can take much longer, through contour length fluctuations (CLFs) and
arm retraction processes.51 But it stays
too fast to be measured. At larger length (time) scales, the relaxed
part of the polymeric brush acts as a “solvent” and
the parts close to the backbone are much less constrained (moving
in a dilated tube). The backbone can then explore its surrounding
by Rouse motions. This mode of relaxation is also called constraint
release Rouse (CRR).51 While the CRR relaxation
is not visible in the case of lower molecular weights (3a and 3b), it is observed, at least partially, with the
longer samples (3c and 3d), due to their
longer disentanglement times. Then, the low-frequency plateau appears,
which is attributed to the interaction between the cores of the supramolecular
assemblies, which cannot easily diffuse and relax.

Figure 7 Tentative representation
of (a) supramolecular bottlebrush polymers 3a–d assuming the interaction between
the cores of the supramolecular brushes is responsible for the elastic
behavior and (b) supramolecular polymer 3e bearing ureido-pyrimidinone
(UPy) forming small assemblies composed of few chains, without long-range
interaction. d*, dπ–π, and ξ are the lamellar periodicity, stacking distance, and
the correlation length, respectively.

At low temperature, the relaxation of the supramolecular assemblies
is so slow that it could not be observed based on oscillatory shear
measurements, and creep measurements should be performed to assess
their viscoelastic response at much longer time. Since the terminal
relaxation time is not known, we cannot clearly identify the relaxation
mechanism of these large assemblies. However, it has been shown that
conventional bottlebrush polymers are relaxing via reptative motion,52 which is probably the case of samples 3a and 3b. On the other hand, in case of samples 3c and 3d, the backbones of the corresponding
supramolecular brushes are so short that it is not clear if they relax
as bottlebrushes or as multiarm stars.14,15

At higher
temperatures, i.e., ≈100 °C (obtained from
VT-FTIR and SAXS), the stickers start to dissociate and part of the
H-bonds is lost. Consequently, the stacking and size of the backbone
decrease. Therefore, the correlation between objects reduces, which
enhances their mobility and a fluid response (G′
< G″) is observed. An interesting observation
is the low-frequency behavior of 3a at 60 °C (Figure 6a). This frequency
sweep in fact shows that despite the dissociation of stickers at temperatures
higher than 100 °C, at longer time scales but lower temperatures,
the sticker can also dissociate, leading to a terminal response (G′ < G″). This phenomenon,
however, was only captured in this specific case, but more detailed
temperature and frequency scans might reveal the same behavior for
the other three samples. It must also be noted that the highest temperature
at which an elastic behavior is observed increases with the length
of the side chains, suggesting that the aggregation lifetime depends
not only on both temperature but also on chain mobility. The consistency
between the temperatures in which long-range ordering/short-range
stacking disappears (75–100 °C) and the fluid response
is obtained (80–120 °C) confirms that it is not the binary
association between the stickers (which still exists to some extent
at elevated temperatures) that controls the solidlike behavior. It
is rather the long-range ordering, which are responsible for this
phenomenon. Thus, in this picture, the binary associations do not
play a role, since the binary association only doubles the chain length,
and this does not suffice to create large objects and observe a solidlike
behavior, as it was shown in the case of 3e. In other
words, a strong and long-ranged stacking is needed to produce one-dimensional
objects, otherwise only small aggregates are formed, which is the
case for 3e.

Conclusions
Utilizing
a newly designed hydrogen-bonding moiety (sticker), a
novel approach for manufacturing bottlebrush polymers is introduced. 1H NMR studies and DFT calculations showed that this sticker
(ODIN) can form a variety of conformers and dimers; however,
only one monomer and one dimer are present as the dominant forms.
Moreover, these studies proved the strong tendency of ODIN for stack formation and sextuple H-bonding in solution. VT-FTIR
and PXRD showed the stacking in the solid state.

To form supramolecular
bottlebrush architecture, ODIN was added to one end of
poly(tetrahydrofuran). The strong stickers
association (H-bonding and π–π stacking) can resist
to the steric hindrance arising from side polymer chains. SAXS studies
showed a lamellar morphology, which was more visible at lower molecular
weights (higher sticker concentrations). The domain size d* in this bottlebrush polymers increases with molecular weight, and
the molecular weight dependence of d* showed that
the PTHF chains are highly stretched. The molecular order disappeared
at higher temperatures close to the temperature range at which ODIN moiety dissociates (observed from VT-FTIR). Melt rheology
showed that the polymer chains close to the supramolecular backbone
(ODIN arrays) are highly stretched and cannot relax via
reptation as one of the ends is pinned to the strongly associated ODIN moiety. Therefore, disentanglement can take much longer,
through contour length fluctuations (CLFs) and arm retraction processes.
The relaxed ends of PTHF chains eventually act as solvent to let the
rest of the polymeric brush undergo Rouse-like motions (constraint
release Rouse or CRR). At longer times, a second rubbery plateau appears
as the signature of the interactions between the cores of the entire
supramolecular bottlebrush polymers. This rigid topology is also a
proof of extended conformation of supramolecular bottlebrush polymers.
With an increase of temperature, viscoelastic solid behavior turns
into viscoelastic liquid due to reversible depolymerization of the
supramolecular backbone of the bottlebrush polymer. The transition
temperature range (80–120 °C) is close to the temperature
where dissociation of ODIN (VT-FTIR) and deformation
of molecular orders (SAXS) occur (75–100 °C), which means
that the stacking and size of the supramolecular backbone decreases
and a fluid response (G′ < G″) is observed.

Thus, these materials adapt their properties
from viscoelastic
liquids to solids and vice versa, with a modulus which makes them
suitable for processing, especially that these polymers are not a
transient network. In addition, they can be applied in supersoft materials
as well.

Future studies focus on a detailed analysis of different
chemistry,
molecular weight, and topology of these novel supramolecular bottlebrush
polymers to further understand the terminal relaxation mechanism of
these supramolecular brush polymers. To this end, it would be helpful
to perform creep measurements. Piezo-rheometry would also be useful,
to visualize the first rubbery plateau, before the disentanglement
of the branches.

Experimental Section
Materials
Anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran (THF) (water content
less than 50 ppm) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Hexamethylene diisocyanate
(HDI) was purchased from TCI. Low-molecular-weight (Mn ≈ 1 kg mol–1) dihydroxyl poly(tetrahydrofuran),
acryloyl chloride, silver tetrafluoroborate (AgBF4), silver
hexafluorophosphate (AgPF6), dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL),
malic acid, 2,6-diaminopyridine, (anhydrous) dimethyl sulfoxide-d6, and chloroform-d were purchased
from Aldrich without further purification. 7-Amino-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one was synthesized by a previously published method.53

Characterization
1H NMR
spectra were recorded
at room temperature on a Varian VXR 400 MHz (1H: 400 MHz)
spectrometer using deuterated solvents. Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in ppm, whereas the chemical shifts are calibrated to
the solvent residual peaks. For the self-assembly studies in solution,
mixtures with different compositions of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 and chloroform-d were prepared.
Tetramethylsilane was used for calibration of chemical shifts. Gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed in THF
at 25 °C (1 mL min–1) on a Spectra-Physics
AS 1000, equipped with PLGel 5 μm × 30 cm mixed-C columns.
Universal calibration was applied using a Viscotek H502 viscometer
and a Shodex RI-71 refractive index detector. The GPC was calibrated
using narrow-disperse polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories).

Melt rheology was carried out via a TA Instruments, AR 1000 under
nitrogen flow, and 8 mm parallel-plate geometries and an interplate
gap of 0.8–1 mm were used in all cases. Samples were vacuum-dried
overnight before use. All measurements were performed in the linear
viscoelastic regime, determined via torque sweep measurements. Frequency
sweeps 0.01–10 Hz were carried out in different temperatures
between 40 and 160 °C. The samples were prepared as follows:
the bulk samples were dried in an oven at 35 °C under vacuum
for 56 h. This can also anneal the samples since this temperature
is found to be above the melting point of polymers. Afterward, the
samples were loaded within the plate–plate geometries and were
left there for 30 min at 40 °C before increasing the temperature
step by step to 160 °C. The measurements at 40 °C were repeated
immediately after the first round of temperature increase (up to 160
°C) and once again after 1 day. It was observed that the data
are reproducible after 1 day. This in fact indicates the structure
formation is lost after each heating but recovers slowly within 1
day. This is additional proof of intactness of the acrylate end-group
during heating. Moreover, the GPC measurement for samples 3d was repeated to see whether the end-group has reacted or not (Figure S14) Variable-temperature FTIR (VT-FTIR)
measurements were conducted on a Bruker IFS88 FTIR spectrometer. At
each temperature, sample was left 15 min to equilibrate the temperature
and then the spectrum was obtained. Differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) measurements were done on a TA Instruments Q1000. The samples
were heated from room temperature to 55 °C and kept there for
15 min to remove the thermal history. Then, they were cooled down
to −20 °C with a rate of 5 °C min–1, equilibrated for 15 min, and heated (10 °C min–1) to 160 °C. The second heating cycle was repeated to check
the reproducibility of the data.

DFT
Molecular geometries and hydrogen-bonded
complexes
have been fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with
the omega B97X-D functional as implemented in Q-Chem, and the basis
sets were corrected.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS)
SAXS experiments
were performed at the MINA Instrument in Groningen. The MINA instrument
is equipped with a rotating Cu anode operating at 45 kV and 60 mA
(X-ray wavelength λ = 1.54 Å). SAXS patterns
were recorded using Vantec Bruker detectors with a 10 min exposure
time. The beam size on the sample was 0.25 mm. The sample temperature
was controlled using a Linkam TMS600 hot stage. Two different sample-to-detector
distances of 24 and 200 cm were used to cover an extended angular
range. The beam center position at the detector and the exact sample-to-detector
position (i.e., the scattering angles) were determined using the diffraction
rings from a standard silver behenate powder. The data were radially
integrated and merged into a single curve using a MATLAB code. Samples
were placed into aluminum hollow disk holders (1 mm thick) sealed
with kapton tape. The samples were kept for 5 h at 50 °C to make
sure no crystal exists then at 25 °C annealed for 4 days. They
were kept at 25 °C before starting the measurements.

Powder X-ray
Diffraction (PXRD)
The PXRD pattern was
recorded on a Bruker D8 advanced diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å) in the angular range of 5–80°
(2θ) at room temperature.

Synthesis of Poly(tetrahydrofuran)s
(PTHFs) 1a–d
The general
procedure is as follows: a 500 mL three-neck
flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirrer was dried and put
under N2 atmosphere. AgPF6 (252 mg, 1 mmol)
was added to 150 mL of anhydrous THF, followed by addition of 90 mg
of 1 mmol acryloyl chloride at room temperature, after which a white
solid arose. The mixture was left stirring to polymerize. After 3
min, 10 mL of water was added to quench the reaction. The mixture
was poured into cold water. The precipitate was filtered off by using
a Buchner funnel or in the case of lower molecular weights using centrifugation
at 5 °C (4500 rpm). The oil was dissolved in 250 mL of diethyl
ether. The ether solution was washed with 250 mL of ammonium hydroxide
and 100 mL of brine. The organic fraction was dried over magnesium
sulfate, filtered, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure.
A white solid of 1 was obtained.

7-Amino-1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one (4 g, 0.025 mol) was added to a 100 mL three-neck
round-bottom flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirrer. The
solids were allowed to dry for 1 h under vacuum. The flask was kept
under nitrogen atmosphere by three consequent vacuum/nitrogen cycles.
HDI (60 mL, 0.37 mol) was added to the reaction flask. The reaction
mixture was heated to 110 °C while stirring. After 19 h, the
reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Then, it was
precipitated in 500 mL of hexane. The precipitate was filtered off
and the traces of HDI were removed by distillation under reduced pressure
(0.01 mbar) at 130 °C. (84% yield)

(3a–d)
A 100 mL three-neck
round-bottom flask was equipped with a reflux condenser with an egg-shaped
magnetic stirrer and put under nitrogen atmosphere. Poly(tetrahydrofuran)
acrylate (PTHF-acrylate, 300 mg) and 3 equiv of isocyanate 2 were added to the reaction flask under nitrogen atmosphere. Then,
20 mL of anhydrous chloroform and two droplets of DBTDL were added
to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was refluxed overnight,
and then, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The polymer
was isolated by dissolving the solid into ethyl acetate and transferring
it to a centrifuge tube, which was centrifuged at 4500 rpm at 0 °C
for 30 min. The unreacted isocyanate 2 precipitates at
the bottom of the tube. The solution was collected, and the solvent
was removed under reduced pressure. A yellow solid was obtained (conversion

Calculation of Kdim
As
the ODIN dimer and monomer are in slow exchange on the 1H NMR timescale, it is possible to calculate the molar concentration
of monomer and dimer based on the integrals of the NMR signals, the
ratio of which is defined as y = (Imon/Idim). From this ratio
and the overall ODIN concentration (U0), the dimerization constant (Kdim) can be calculated using the following equation
