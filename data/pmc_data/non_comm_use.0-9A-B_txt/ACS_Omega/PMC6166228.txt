Renin–angiotensin system (RAS)
plays an important role in
the regulation of blood pressure and hormonal balance. Using positron
emission tomography (PET) technology, it is possible to monitor the
physiological and pathological distribution of angiotensin II type
1 receptors (AT1), which reflects the functionality of
RAS. A new 18F-labeled PET tracer derived from the clinically
used AT1 antagonist valsartan showing the least possible
chemical alteration from the valsartan structure has been designed
and synthesized with several strategies, which can be applied for
the syntheses of further derivatives. Radioligand binding study showed
that the cold reference FV45 (Ki 14.6
nM) has almost equivalent binding affinity as its lead valsartan (Ki 11.8 nM) and angiotensin II (Ki 1.7 nM). Successful radiolabeling of FV45 in a one-pot
radiofluorination followed by the deprotection procedure with 21.8
± 8.5% radiochemical yield and >99% radiochemical purity (n = 5) enabled a distribution study in rats and opened a
path to straightforward large-scale production. A fast and clear kidney
uptake could be observed, and this renal uptake could be selectively
blocked by pretreatment with AT1-selective antagonist valsartan.
Overall, as the first 18F-labeled PET tracer based on a
derivation from clinically used drug valsartan with almost identical
chemical structure, [18F]FV45 will be a new tool for assessing
the RAS function by visualizing AT1 receptor distributions
and providing further information regarding cardiovascular system
malfunction as well as possible applications in inflammation research
and cancer diagnosis.

==== Body
Introduction
The
renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is a hormonal cascade
that generates angiotensin peptides and is the main regulator of blood
pressure as well as fluid and electrolyte balance.1 The key mediator is the octapeptide angiotensin II, which
stimulates mainly angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1),
a G-protein coupled receptor, and thereby initiates further downstream
effects and leads to vasoconstriction. AT1 receptors are
mainly located in the heart, blood vessels, and kidneys. Therefore,
it is currently one of the major therapeutic targets in the treatment
of hypertension and heart failure (HF).2 Furthermore, the angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitor combination
valsartan/sacubitril (LCZ696) has shown improved cardiovascular outcomes
than ACE inhibitor enalapril as achieved in the prospective comparison
of ARNI with ACEI to determine impact on global mortality and mobility
in heart failure.3 Its approval (commercial
name Entresto by Novartis) for the treatment of HF in both the United
States and Europe is considered a further milestone for the application
of AT1 antagonists.

In addition to the central role
of RAS in the regulation of cardiovascular
system mentioned above, it is also involved in a much broader range
of functions in the body, including actions on growth factors, inflammation,
mitosis, and cancer pathogenesis.4 The
majority of these functions are through the regulation of AT1 receptors. Several clinical investigations involving a large number
of patients in recent years have been conducted to explore the possibility
of using AT1 antagonists against several forms of cancer,
e.g., prostate,5 lung,6,7 colon,8 and breast cancer.9 However, it should be mentioned that the results obtained remain
controversial and the mechanism of these antitumor functions is not
yet clarified. Studies have suggested that AT1 receptor
level changes during disease progression, while AT1 blockade
seems to be able to adjust the consequences of such alterations.10−12 Therefore, AT1 level is considered a key reflector of
RAS function. Molecular imaging technique is ideal for monitoring
in vivo AT1 levels noninvasively. There is a high density
of AT1 receptors in the kidneys responsible for the regulation
of blood pressure and furthermore functions.13 Thereby, in animal studies, the kidney represents the primary organ
of RAS imaging to be investigated.

In contrast to anatomical
techniques, molecular imaging techniques
using radionuclide tracers focus more on subcellular down to molecular-level
events. They provide a noninvasive method to examine functional changes
in individual organs, with high sensitivity, specificity, and the
possibility of quantifying alterations. Moreover, the rational
design of radiotracers based on biological and chemical knowledge
makes it feasible to bring forth valuable pathophysiological information
in patients and further insight into in vivo conditions of specific
targets.14 Currently, positron emission
tomography (PET) is receiving more attention due to several advantages
compared to single-photon emission computed tomography, namely, its
higher count sensitivity, higher temporal and spatial resolution,
as well as its ability to be used in dynamic and quantitative studies.15 In PET applications with the possibility of
performing dynamic and quantitative studies, new fluorine-18-based
radiotracers bring forth improved imaging characteristics over carbon-11-labeled
counterparts.16 The use of fluorine-18
compensates the high cost for on-site radioisotope production due
to its reasonably longer half-life (110 min) over carbon-11 (20 min),
which has been one of the factors limiting the wide utilization of
PET. This allows multiple scans each day with barely any in-patient
cost. Besides, the application of fluorine-18 in PET may also provide
higher flexibility in the design and syntheses of novel PET tracers
together with an improvement of in vivo stability by reduced metabolism.14

Considering the important role of the
RAS regulation of the renal
and cardiovascular system and the necessity of clarifying its role
in inflammation and tumor pathophysiology, PET tracers derived from
highly selective AT1 specific antagonists are of interest
and ideal to reflect its levels, especially in functional diagnosis
of renal and cardiovascular diseases or hallmarks of cancer.17 To date, the application of such tracers in
PET imaging has not yet been extensively investigated, and only a
handful of radiotracers (Figure 1) have been reported: [11C]KR31173, the
methoxy analogue of the nonpeptide AT1-selective antagonist
SK1080,18−20 and 11C- and 18F-labeled losartan
derivatives connecting the sartan moiety with the radioactive fluoropyridinyl
moiety using click chemistry.21−26

Figure 1 Chemical
structures of currently reported AT1 antagonist-derived
radiotracers and their corresponding lead compounds.18,22

By applying [11C]KR31173
(Figure 1), it was
possible to establish first correlations
between arterial and kidney blood input and radioligand uptake in
pigs, which makes it a candidate for quantitative evaluation of RAS
functions in this organ.27,28 Recently, the first-in-human
study has also been approved and performed, which showed good clinical
safety along with detectable and specific myocardial retention.29 However, it should be pointed out that even
though [11C]KR31173 has the above-mentioned properties,
the clinical application might be limited due to the general drawbacks
of 11C-labeled tracers as mentioned above.

A fluorine-18-labeled
losartan tracer was derived from its corresponding
short-half-life carbon-11 tracer.25 [18F]FPyKYNE-Losartan (Figure 1) was successfully labeled using click chemistry. Its
in vivo studies on rats and pigs have been performed with favorable
binding profile.26 In addition, this tracer
seems to make in vivo quantification of kidney AT1 receptors
possible in the process of disease development and applied pharmacotherapies.30 Yet, compared to either losartan or candesartan,
high liver uptake and decreased angiotensin II pressor effect at AT1 receptor might be drawbacks, possibly due to the introduction
of bulky triazole and pyridine moieties in favor of easy labeling
procedure. In addition, the multi-step radiolabeling procedure as
well as the decrease of binding affinity to AT1 receptor
might also limit the application.

Valsartan shows high efficacy,
tolerability, and patient compliance,
which make it one of the leading antihypertensive and cardioprotective
therapeutics.31 The advantage of using
valsartan as the lead structure to develop an 18F-labeled
tracer for PET imaging is based on its comparatively simple chemical
structure and hydrophilicity, which might lead to relative lower liver
uptake and therefore better imaging quality. Furthermore, deriving
the radiotracer from a reference drug may reduce the cost of production
by using the same chemical intermediates for preparation. By investigating
the structure–activity relationships (SARs) of the sartan series
of compounds, fluorine-18 can be introduced into the terminal of its
aliphatic “tail”. Thereby, a novel tracer [18F]FV45 targeting RAS was designed (Figure 2). A substituent on the diphenyl ring will
lead to increased binding affinity at AT2 receptors.32 An introduction of fluorine on the isopropyl
moiety is another possibility, although the synthetic approach to
achieve a corresponding precursor (on which the radioactive isotope
is introduced to form the target radioactive tracer) would be chemically
demanding. Since fluorine is smaller than hydrogen and has neutral
properties, this modification should maintain its affinity and give
access to a comparatively straightforward chemical synthetic scheme.33 In addition, fluorination on this position might
block the formation of a potential metabolite, nonactive 4-hydroxyvalsartan,34 and consequently, alter the pharmacokinetics
of this tracer, for instance, by decreasing liver uptake and increasing
renal excretion.

Results
Chemistry
To prepare
the precursor for labeling, different
synthetic approaches have been investigated for the preparation of
both the precursor and the corresponding cold compound (nonradioactive
fluorine derivate). Diphenyl tetrazole moiety 4 was prepared
according to the procedure described in the literature (Scheme 1).33,35

Scheme 1 Synthetic Scheme of Biphenyl Tetrazole Moiety 4(35,36)
In the first attempt to build
the precursor, 5-chlorovaleric acid 5 was attached to
the diphenyl valinate moiety 7, which was formed by reacting
diphenyl tetrazole moiety 4 with tert-butyl valinate 6. The chlorine
atom in compound 8 was replaced by iodine through the
Finkelstein reaction. While trying to introduce a tosylate moiety
into compound 9 to serve as a leaving group for fluorination,
the p-toluenesulfonic acid in silver tosylate leads
to deprotection of the trityl group of the tetrazole and no product 10 was formed. The reaction could not take place either when
adding 10% base in the attempt to neutralize excessive acid. Subsequently,
a second attempt to achieve ω-hydroxyvalsartan 12 was performed by reacting the diphenyl valinate moiety 7 with δ-valerolactone 11 in different solvents,
including chloroform, toluene, and xylene, at various temperatures.
However, none of them gave desired products. While using aluminum
chloride-catalyzed ammonolysis of compound 7 with lactone 11,37 the starting material decomposed
in the reaction condition with no product formation. Using silver
fluoride in an effort to replace either chloride of compound 8 or iodide of compound 9 also turned out to
be unsuccessful and produced mainly ω-hydroxyvalsartan 12.38 Unfortunately, an attempt
to react this byproduct compound 12 with tosyl chloride
to get the precursor 10 failed, too. All unsuccessful
attempts to achieve precursor and cold compound are illustrated in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Attempts
for the Preparation of Cold Compound FV45 and
the Precursor for Radiolabeling37,38
The final synthetic procedure used the acyl
chain with either fluorine
(for the cold reference) or tosylate (for the precursor) already connected,
followed by coupling with the diphenyl valinate moiety 7. Accordingly, the successful approach started from 5-chlorovaleric
acid 5, which was first esterified to protect the carboxyl
group. The chlorine atom in compound 13 was replaced
by iodine through the Finkelstein reaction. This gave the possibility
of further replacement by tosylate using silver tosylate, which was
obtained by mixing equal molar quantities of silver oxide with 4-toluenesulfonic
acid in acetonitrile in darkness.39 After
removal of the benzyl ester selectively under mild hydrogenation conditions
without affecting the tosylate, acid 17 reacted with
oxalyl chloride in dry dichloromethane to form acid chloride 18. It was then reacted with diphenyl valinate moiety 7, and precursor 10 became available for labeling
(Scheme 3). The fluorine
atom of the cold compound was introduced by replacing the tosyl in intermediate 15.40 Fluorination conditions could
also be evaluated as a reference for the radiolabeling procedure.
Thereafter, FV45 was synthesized analogously as the precursor, with
the only difference of using benzyl valinate 21 instead
of tert-butyl ester (Scheme 3). The benzyl ester group is more stable
during preparation, whereas tert-butyl ester in the
precursor could be concomitantly removed after radiolabeling together
with the trityl group under acidic condition.

Scheme 3 Final Synthetic Schemes
of Precursor 10 with Corresponding
Cold Reference FV45 and Radiolabeling Procedure
Radiochemistry
As a good leaving
group, a tosyl moiety
could be substituted by fluorine-18 in the labeling procedure. Different
solvents, reacting temperature, and sources of [18F]F– were investigated. Dimethylformamide (DMF) provided
high reaction temperature up to 140 °C. Acetonitrile gave mild
reaction condition and temperature and is also easier to provide anhydrous
condition by azeotropic distillation. In addition, Cs[18F]F, K[18F]F and tetrabutylammonium [18F]F
([18F]TBAF) were used as sources of fluorine-18. Although
all of these sources and conditions succeeded in radiolabeling, K[18F]F in acetonitrile with Kryptofix2.2.2 as phase
transfer catalyst was selected as the most conventional and conveniently
performed procedure. The last step, deprotection of both trityl on
tetrazole and tert-butyl ester group, was first set
for 10 min at 110 °C. During the purification via semipreparative
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the formation of a
30–50% of byproduct was observed. This byproduct was later
identified as the tert-butyl ester of FV45 (Figure S2). As it had turned out that the tert-butyl ester is more stable than expected, the reaction
time for deprotection was prolonged to 20 min. The intermediate was
then also transformed to the target tracer, and the yield for [18F]FV45 was greatly improved (Figure S3). Finally, a purification step using semipreparative HPLC was still
needed since the majority of the precursor decomposed during radiofluorination
procedure and a couple of byproducts formed that could not be simply
removed with a C18 Sep-Pak. In the end, with the improved labeling
condition and procedure, the total synthesis of labeling takes approximately
120 min. The average overall radiochemical yield was 21.8 ± 8.5%
(decay-corrected based on the starting radioactivity, calculated from
5 times of labeling records), and radiochemical purity was >99%.
In
summary, with one-pot reaction and straightforward labeling procedure,
the rationale of the tracer design was successfully achieved. Additionally,
such procedure would be easily scaled up for further preclinical or
even clinical studies, with the possibility of using fully automated
labeling system for tracer synthesis.

Binding Studies on Human
AT1 Receptors
To
evaluate the binding affinity of FV45 at AT1 receptors,
it is necessary to compare the cold reference with both its lead valsartan
and angiotensin II. By doing so, it would be able to confirm that
such strategy of designing tracers from the corresponding clinically
used drug is principally feasible. It would also provide further insight
into the strategy, whether the introduction of fluorine at the terminal
of the acyl chain would affect the binding affinity of FV45 to AT1 receptors. Although fluorine is considered as a bioisostere
of hydrogen, it is also possible to behave as a hydrogen-bond acceptor.41 In short, membrane from CHO-K1 cells expressing
human AT1 receptors were used in the assay. Competitive
binding of angiotensin II, valsartan, and FV45 was tested against 125I-angiotensin II as the radioligand. The results clearly
showed that FV45 could compete with the radioligand to bind to AT1 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3). It has proved that the derivation
did not affect the competitive binding affinity of FV45, which retained
in the same range as its lead valsartan (Ki value FV45 14.6 nM vs valsartan 11.8 nM), while slightly less compared
to angiotensin II (1.7 nM). The almost identical affinity profile
enables the application of our synthesis procedure to other sartans
with similar structures to derive corresponding tracers or to develop
further sartan derivatives for therapeutic purposes, for instance,
to change bioavailability or pharmacokinetics.

from four independent experiments. The Ki values are 1.7 ± 0.4 nM for angiotensin II, 11.8 ± 3.4
nM for valsartan, and 14.6 ± 10.0 nM for FV45.

Renal Imaging Studies in Rats
Standard
protocols and
data analysis methods for noninvasive PET imaging of small animals
have been well established in our working group.42 After [18F]FV45 was successfully labeled as
described above and radioactive purity was confirmed, the anesthetized
rats of the control group were injected the tracer via the tail vein.
To determine the specificity of [18F]FV45, the rats were
first treated with AT1 antagonist valsartan 10 min before
the tracer was administered. A 60 min list-mode PET acquisition focusing
on the kidney area was started shortly after the injection because
there is high density of AT1 receptors expressed in the
kidney. The static images obtained demonstrated distinct [18F]FV45 accumulation in the kidneys, mainly renal cortex. Valsartan
visibly inhibited kidney uptake of [18F]FV45 (Figure 4), which indicates
that the tracer uptake is specific to the AT1 receptor.
Further dynamic imaging of the tracer revealed that there was a fast
and high uptake of [18F]FV45 in the coronal section of
the kidney 10 min after injection (Figure 5). This uptake could be blocked by pretreatment
of valsartan, and no uptake in the kidney could be observed during
the whole imaging time frame. In short, despite some unfavorable uptake
into the liver (Figure 5, top), the selective uptake of [18F]FV45 into renal cortex
was clearly observed.

and blockade
by selective AT1 antagonist valsartan (right). Preadministration
of AT1 antagonist valsartan distinctly inhibits the kidney
coronal uptake of this derived tracer [18F]FV45.

and blockade by selective AT1 antagonist valsartan (bottom).
Every 5 min is a time frame. Co-injection of AT1 antagonist
valsartan clearly reduced the kidney uptake of [18F]FV45
that shows a selective AT1 receptor-targeting mechanism.

Discussion
The
RAS plays a key role not only in renal and cardiovascular diseases
but also in processes of inflammation and cancer cell proliferation
and angiogenesis. Currently, there are only a couple of AT1-targeting PET tracers reported in the literature. Most of them are
connections of easily labeled chemical moieties and the parent sartan
compounds, i.e., a simple connection without paying attention to SARs
of these compounds, which may significantly change the binding properties
at AT1 receptor as well as pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
These factors might be crucial to reflect the true status of RAS in
the body under pathophysiological conditions. Therefore, it seems
necessary to develop a novel class of 18F-labeled radiotracers
targeting RAS through medicinal chemical techniques and applying rational
drug design methodology, exemplified here with ω-fluoro-valsartan
(FV45) as the first of its kind. By analyzing the SARs of sartan compounds,
it was possible to design and develop compounds that retain or even
improve the original ones’ pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic
properties.

Successful syntheses of the cold reference of FV45
and the corresponding
precursor was achieved. The improved synthetic scheme is suitable
to be scaled up, and the strategy could be applied to other sartans
with similar structures, especially regarding the fluorine substitution
and its position, as well as the chemical synthesis design. The introduction
of fluorine would be ideal at any aliphatic moieties that bind to
the same hydrophobic binding pocket of AT1 receptor as
illustrated in the SARs of losartan.32 For
example, losartan, candesartan, irbesartan, and olmesartan all have
such aliphatic tail in their structures, where the fluorine could
be introduced to produce PET tracer following the same strategy. The
radiolabeling of FV45 was carried out under no-carrier-added K[18F]F/Kryptofix2.2.2 condition using dry acetonitrile
as solvent. Good yields, as well as high purity, could be achieved
within the short-time labeling procedure, which might also serve as
a standard labeling procedure for other sartan tracers derived from
comparable principles due to their structural similarity.

Competitive
binding assay proved that FV45 has similar binding
affinity (17.4 nM) to the AT1 receptor as angiotensin II
(2.0 nM) and its lead valsartan (14.0 nM). In PET imaging studies
in rats, clear and fast kidney uptake was observed after administration
of [18F]FV45. Renal imaging instead of cardiac imaging
was performed because the distribution of AT1 receptors
in the kidney is highly conserved in all mammals, whereas in the rat
heart, only low density of AT1 receptors is expressed in
the atrial and ventricular myocardium.43 Furthermore, the uptake in the kidney could be blocked by pretreatment
of its parent compound—the selective AT1 antagonist
valsartan. It confirmed not only the specificity of FV45, but also
our strategy to evolve AT1 PET tracers from clinically
used sartans with the minimum chemical modification. It is noteworthy
that the tracer has a relatively short retention time in the kidneys,
as can be seen from the dynamic scan. We do not consider this as a
negative property for a novel designed tracer though: no obvious decomposition
and/or metabolism happens in vivo, and no free fluorine-18 is released
into the circulation system or long-term bone marrow storage (Figure 5). Approximately
15 min after tracer injection, [18F]FV45 was washed out
of the kidneys. This corresponds to one key point in our compound
design that excretion from kidneys might be increased compared to
the lead compound valsartan, or both sartan tracers mentioned above.
The following two factors should be taken into account to give reasonable
explanations for these changes: (a) metabolism and excretion in rodents
are on average faster than in humans and (b) the relatively more polar
structure of valsartan in comparison to other AT1 antagonists
makes it quickly excreted in the urine. This faster excretion might
be influenced by the structural modification, i.e., the fluorination,
since valsartan has an average half-life of around 6 h. The advantage
of the fast excretion decreases the possibility of its accumulation
in body and the consequent side effects. However, the strategy provided
a basis for further tracer development, such as using alternative
sartans with naturally longer half-life, which might be helpful to
improve this property.

Furthermore, AT1 antagonists
also have the therapeutic
potential, in particular, enhancing immunotherapy in cancer.44 As a consequence, a PET tracer, such as [18F]FV45, might also be used in investigating RAS functions
in oncology, e.g., in diagnosis of cancers. It could also be helpful
in answering questions like whether AT1 antagonists could
interfere in the newly discovered ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis of the RAS.45 In addition, provided that the iodine derivative
of a sartan, such as 131I instead of 18F retains
similar properties in vitro and in vivo, such compounds might hold
potential for application in cancer therapy. Moreover, such modification
derived from the clinically used sartans with the least structural
changes might also provide novel directions in AT1 antagonist
development with regard to better pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

Conclusions
The first of a new generation of PET tracers derived from clinically
used AT1 receptor antagonists targeting the RAS system
with minimum structural modification has been designed, successfully
synthesized, and evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Fluorine-18
instead of carbon-11 was selected for radiolabeling due to its longer
half-life and advantages in precursor design. The labeling procedure
has been optimized with good yield and high radiochemical purity suitable
for mass production. As bioisostere of hydrogen, fluorine could be introduced
into the aliphatic tail of sartans without affecting the binding affinity.
As a result, [18F]FV45 showed almost identical AT1 receptor binding affinity as its lead compound valsartan. An imaging
study using Wistar rats showed fast and clear kidney uptake, which
could be blocked selectively by pretreatment with the AT1 antagonist valsartan. Overall, the strategy of evolving novel PET
tracers from clinically used sartans with the least structural changes
may point out a new direction in RAS imaging and even facilitate translational
work to humans, exemplified here with valsartan derived tracer [18F]FV45 that showed almost identical affinity in binding assay
and good imaging properties of kidneys in rats. The work of this paper
has been included in and filed as patent.46

Experimental Section
Common reagents and solvents were obtained
from commercial suppliers
and were used without any further purification. Tetrahydrofuran (THF)
was distilled from sodium/benzophenone under argon atmosphere. The
reaction progress was monitored by using analytical thin-layer chromatography
on precoated silica gel GF254 plates (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co.
KG, Düren, Germany) and spots were detected under UV light
(λ = 254 nm) or by staining with iodine. NMR spectra were performed
with a Bruker AV-400 NMR instrument (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) in
[D6]DMSO or CDCl3. Chemical shifts are expressed
in parts per million relative to CHCl3/dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) (d = 7.26/2.50 and 77.16/39.52 ppm for 1H- and 13C NMR spectroscopy, respectively). For
purity and reaction analyzes, analytical HPLC analysis was performed
with a system from Shimadzu equipped with a DGU-20A3R controller,
LC20AB liquid chromatograph, and an SPD-20A UV/Vis detector. Stationary
phase was a Synergi 4 μm fusion-RP (150 × 4.6 mm2) column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany). As mobile phase, H2O (phase A) and methanol (phase B) were used with 1 mL/min
(conc. B: 5 → 90% from 0 to 8 min; 90% from 8 to 13 min; 90
→ 5% from 13 to 15 min; 5% from 15 to 18 min). All target compounds
were confirmed with purity over 95%. Electrospray ionization (ESI)
mass spectral data were acquired with a Shimadzu LCMS-2020.

Radiochemistry
[18F]F– produced via proton bombardment
of H218O was
isolated by trapping on Sep-Pak Light QMA cartridge, followed by washing
with 3 mL of water. Fluoride was eluted with a solution of K2CO3 in 0.3 mL of water (50.6 mM) into a sealed glass vial
containing a solution of Kryptofix 2.2.2 (14 mg) in 0.7
mL of acetonitrile. Azeotropic drying of the solution was performed
under argon flow at 120 °C with several times of addition of
dry acetonitrile. The solution of 5 mg of precursor compound 10 in 0.3 mL of dry acetonitrile was added to the residue,
followed by heating at 110 °C for 10 min under argon atmosphere.
Subsequent hydrolysis of tert-butyl ester together
with the removal of trityl protection group was performed in the same
vessel by the addition of 0.3 mL of 1 N HCl and continued heating
at 110 °C for 20 min. The mixture was cooled, diluted with 1
mL of a mixture solution of water and acetonitrile (1:1), and applied
to the semipreparative HPLC column (ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18, 5 μm, 9.4 × 250 mm2, linear gradient of 50–95%
methanol with 0.1% formic acid, 3 mL/min). After purification, 5 mL
of water was added to the collected solution containing radioactive
tracer. The solution was then passed through a Sep-Pak plus cartridge
(C18), washed with 4 mL of water, and eluted with 3 mL of diethyl
ether. The organic solution was concentrated at 50 °C and diluted
with saline to an appropriate concentration for the imaging studies.

Competitive Binding Study
The radioligand binding assay
was performed by using cell membrane preparations from CHO-K1 cells
expressing human AT1 receptors (Membrane Target Systems;
PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Human AT1 receptor (0.6 μg
of membrane protein/well) was incubated with assay buffer (50 mM Tris·HCl,
5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing various concentrations of
test compounds (radiotracer) and 125I-Sar1-Ile8-AngII (final concentration, 0.3 nM) in 200 μL total
volume in 96-well plate at room temperature. After 1 h, the plate
was washed nine times with 250 μL/well of wash buffer (50 mM
Tris·HCl, pH 7.4) to remove unbound tracer. Membrane-bound radioactivity
was counted using a γ-counter (FH 412; Frieseke & Höpfner,
Erlangen, Germany). Nonspecific binding of 125I-Sar1-Ile8-AngII was estimated in the presence of 10
M unlabeled AngII. Specific binding is defined as total binding minus
nonspecific binding. Ki values are calculated
from the IC50 values using the Cheng–Prusoff equation: Ki = IC50/(1 + [L]/Kd), where the final concentration of radioligand is 0.03
nM and Kd of 125I-Sar1-Ile8-AngII is 0.16 nM.

Animal Imaging Study
Healthy male Wistar rats (weighing
200–250 g) were used. The animal protocols were approved by
the local institutional animal care and use committee and were conducted
strictly according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.47 The rats were maintained under
anesthesia by 2% isoflurane during the whole experiment. [18F]FV45 (20–25 MBq) was administered via the tail vein as two
different medications: intravenous injection of the tracer (n = 3); a pretreatment of 30 mg/kg valsartan orally 3 h
before the study and 10 min intravenous before tracer delivery. Imaging
was performed using a dedicated small-animal PET system (Inveon, Siemens
Healthcare). A 60 min list-mode PET acquisition was started shortly
after injection. The reconstructed PET images were analyzed using
an imaging-processing application (AMIDE-bin, version 1.0.2).
