We report a simple
size focusing, two-step “bottom-up”
protocol to prepare water-soluble Au25(MBA)18 nanoclusters, using the three isomers of mercaptobenzoic acids (p/m/o-MBA) as capping
ligands and Me3NBH3 as a mild reducing agent.
The relative stability of the gas-phase multiply deprotonated Au25(MBA)18 ions was investigated by collision-induced
dissociation. This permitted us to evaluate the possible isomeric
effect on the Au–S interfacial bond stress. We also investigated
their optical properties. The absorption spectra of Au25(MBA)18 isomers were very similar and showed bands at
690, 470, and 430 nm. For all Au25(MBA)18 isomeric
clusters, no measurable one-photon excited fluorescence under UV–vis
light was found, in neither solid- nor solution-state. The two-photon
excited emission spectra and first hyperpolarizabilities of the clusters
were also determined. The results are discussed in terms of the possible
isomeric effect on excitations within the metal core and the possibility
of charge transfer excitations from the ligands to the metal nanocluster.

1 Introduction
Liganded
noble metal nanoclusters (NCs) can be produced with atomic
precision1 and are of great potential for
applications in various fields where the structure–property
correlations are key parameters.2 Among
the plethora of NCs for which crystal structures have been reported,
Au25(SR)18 (where SR stands for a chemical group
containing a sulfur atom) stimulated tremendous interest both experimentally3−5 and theoretically6,7 because of its ease of preparation
and functionalization, and also to its fascinating optical,8 chiroptical,9,10 magnetic,11 and electrochemical properties.12,13 An updated summary in the related investigations of Au25(SR)18 has been recently reported in the review of Zhu
and co-workers.14

Au25 NCs have been capped mainly by thiol ligands. More
than 50 thiol ligands have been reported so far for producing Au25(SR)18 using methods based on in situ, one-pot synthesis or on the ligand-exchange method from a templated
Au25(SR)18.14 This
has permitted to investigate the possible role of the chemical group
covalently attached to sulfur in thiol ligands on many physicochemical
properties of Au25 NCs, particularly their optical properties.8 The role of ligands has permitted in some cases
to propose ligand engineering strategies to tune these properties.
The ligand effect on their emission properties was investigated in
the seminal paper of Wu and Jin.8 Both
the total number of charges in the gold core and the nature of the
ligand were found to influence the fluorescence. In particular, the
nature of capping ligands was found to affect both the charge transfer
from the ligands to the metal core via the Au–S bonds and the
donation of delocalized electrons of the ligands to the metal core.
In contrast, the investigation of the role of ligands to the nonlinear
optical (NLO) properties of Au25(SR)18 is still
in its infancy, and only a few studies on NLO measurements have been
published.15,16 We reported recently that the
first hyperpolarizability value (β) responsible for second harmonic
response was very similar between cysteine and glutathione (a cysteine
containing peptide) as ligands.17 Verbiest
and co-workers18 found a drastic dependence
of the hyperpolarizability value on the surface ligand chirality.

However, so far, the ligand’s role on physicochemical properties
of Au25 NCs was mainly explored by changing the structure
and the bulkiness of protecting thiols. Surprisingly, the isomeric
effect of thiolate molecules on the synthesis and optical properties
of metal NCs was only scarcely investigated. The role of sterics (using
three different tolyl ligands) in phosphine-ligated gold clusters
was investigated very recently.19 Also,
Jin and co-workers20 demonstrated that
three isomeric methylbenzenethiols (p/m/o-MBT) can have significant effects on the resulting
size of gold NCs. Azubel et al.21 and Tero
et al.22 recently reported on the ligand–metal
interfacial interactions in gold NCs protected by meta-mercaptobenzoic acid and pointed out weak π–Au and
O=C–OH···Au interactions between m-MBA and Au clusters. On the other hand, Chang and co-workers23 evidenced isomeric effects of mercaptobenzoic
acids (MBA) on the synthesis and fluorescence of copper NCs aggregates.
In particular, different pH-dependent optical properties were reported,
allowing differentiation of the three isomers of mercaptobenzoic acids
(p/m/o-MBA).

In this work, we investigate the isomeric effect of MBA on the
preparation and optical properties of Au25(MBA)18 NCs. We report for the first time a simple size focusing synthesis
of Au25(MBA)18 NCs, with the three isomers of
mercaptobenzoic acid (p/m/o-MBA) (Scheme 1). The relative stability of the three isomeric Au25(MBA)18 was investigated by collision-induced dissociation
(CID). This permits evaluation of the effect of ligand isomerization
on the relative stability of the three clusters. We also investigate
their NLO properties after an initial two-photon process. First hyperpolarizabilities,
as obtained by the hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) technique, and
two-photon excited emission spectra of these isomeric clusters are
thus presented. The results are discussed in terms of the possible
isomeric effect on the leading two-photon excitation process.

2 Results
and Discussion
Ligands used in this work are 2, 3 or 4-mercaptobenzoic
acid (ortho,
meta, or para isomers of MBA) which only differs by the position of
the carboxylic group on the phenyl ring. Because many factors may
affect the size selectivity of AuNCs synthesis, including solution
conditions and the strength of the reducing agent, we used the exact
same procedure for the syntheses based on each considered isomer (see
the Experimental Section for details). This
procedure typically involves a “bottom-up” size focusing
by a two-step process (Scheme 1): (i) reduction of Au(III) to Au(I) forming (Au–S–Ph–COOH)n intermediate complexes and (ii) slow reduction
of Au(I) to Au(0) by a mild reducing agent (e.g., Me3NBH3). It is thought that this two-step process generates small
size gold–thiolate intermediates that lead ultimately to the
formation of Au25 clusters, thereby supporting the “bottom-up”
terminology employed. In the first step, the ion-pairing between the
carboxylic group and tributylamine allows for the solubility of gold–thiolate
intermediates formed during the reaction and increases the steric
hindrance of the carboxylic group, thus limiting the formation of
large-size gold–thiolate intermediates. Of note, without tributylamine,
the gold–thiolate complexes are not soluble. In the second
step, by using Me3NBH3 as a mild reducing agent,
the reduction of gold–thiolate intermediates is slow enough
to allow cluster formation and rearrangement leading mainly to the
most stable Au25 cluster size, by a kinetically controlled
process.24

Starting with 100 mg (2.55
mmol) of tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate
(HAuCl4, 3H2O), we isolate after purification
73 mg of Au25(m-MBA)18 (≈93%
yield based on gold atom), 32 mg of Au25(p-MBA)18 (≈40% yield), and 16 mg of Au25(o-MBA)18 (≈20% yield) [see polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (PAGE) after purification, Figure S1 in the Supporting Information]. Note that for o-MBA, smaller sizes are also produced, as visible before
purification. For p-MBA, Au36(MBA)24 is also formed and can be isolated during the purification
process.25 Clearly, an isomeric effect
of mercaptobenzoic acids on the preparation of Au25(MBA)18 NCs is observed. This may be explained qualitatively based
on steric hindrance of the carboxylic group (bulkiness of the carboxylic
groups with respect to other benzene rings in the ligand shell, see Scheme 1) and its ion-pairing
with tributylamine. Indeed, o-MBA leads to a strong
steric hindrance at the surface of the gold core and avoids the formation
of large NCs. Consequently, smaller Au-MBA cluster sizes and (Au-MBA)n polymers are produced in addition to Au25(MBA)18. On the other hand, for p-MBA, the steric hindrance is reduced at the surface of the gold
core, and then higher cluster size (in particular Au36(MBA)24) can be produced. Interestingly, for m-MBA
isomer, a yield of synthesis close to 100% is obtained. In that case,
it is possible that a good match between the size of the ligand shell
(in Au25(MBA)18) and the steric hindrance brought
by the carboxylic group in the metaposition (see Scheme 1) lead exclusively to the Au25 cluster size, by a kinetically controlled process.

The gold clusters produced by the synthesis described above were
characterized by mass spectrometry and optical methods. The monodispersity
in terms of the size of the prepared gold clusters was addressed by
ESI–mass spectrometry and PAGE.26 ESI mass spectra for the protected Au25 clusters with
the three isomers (o-, m-, and p-MBA) and acquired under gentle ESI conditions are shown
in Figure 1. A charge
state distribution of general formula [M – nH+](n+1)– (2 ≤ n ≤ 6) is observed for the Au25 cluster
with the three isomers (o-, m-,
and p-MBA). Of note, the ESI mass spectrum in negative
mode of Au25(p-MBA)18 leads
to a broader charge state distribution and higher charge states than
the ones observed for Au25(m-MBA)18 and Au25(o-MBA)18. As illustrated in Figure S2 (see Supporting Information), the experimental isotopic distributions of the
3– species from each ligand isomer can be very well reproduced
by simulated ones assuming that protons are removed from two of the
MBA carboxyl groups. Because those two deprotonations account only
for part of the total charge of the ions, we assumed that the gold
cluster is bearing one net negative charge (leading to [M –
2H+]3–). Deconvolution of different charge
states, using a multiplicative correlation algorithm,27 provided a mass of 7677 Da for all isomers of Au25, consistent with the calculated mass of Au25(MBA)18. Additionally, PAGE for Au25 clusters confirms
the monodispersity in terms of the size of the prepared Au25(MBA)18 isomeric clusters (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 1 ESI mass spectra for
the protected Au25 clusters from
water solution acquired under gentle ESI conditions.

Figure 2 shows the
UV–vis absorption spectra in water of the synthesized Au25(MBA)18 isomeric clusters. The absorption spectra
of Au25(MBA)18 isomers show multiple bands at
690, 470, and 430 nm and are very similar to the ones reported and
assigned for [Au25(SR)18]− NCs28,29 with different ligands. No significant isomer
effect, except slight shifts in the position of bands, is observed
on the absorption spectra. The fact that the absorption spectra of
Au25(MBA)18 isomers are similar to the 25-Au-atom
cluster (Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)18) (reported in ref (4) and for which a crystal structure has been obtained) may indicate
that Au25(MBA)18 isomers and Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)18 NCs have similar structural
trends, although UV–vis absorption is not the method of choice
to determine or compare structures.

Figure 2 Absorption spectra of Au25(MBA)18 NC from
water solution.

In order to better structurally
characterize our NCs, we conducted
ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IM–MS) measurements.
IM–MS is an emerging tool for the NC community, which allows
separating mass selected ions based on the differences of their electrical
mobility in a buffer gas.30−34 The IMS arrival time distributions (ATDs) are dominated by a single
peak (ATDs for isomers of Au25(MBA)18 are given
in Figure S3); however, tails at shorter
arrival times are also visible and are attributed to dynamical effects
occurring during the flight. Such features are not attributed to coexistence
of different isomers but to either fragmentation or electron loss.35 Absolute values for the collision cross section
(CCS) of the Au25(MBA)18 clusters were obtained
by measuring their ATDs at different drift voltages and are displayed
for different charge states in Figure S4 in Supporting Information.34 For low charge states
(3−), the collision cross sections are very similar, whatever
the isomer of MBA. This suggests that the three Au25(MBA)18 isomers have a similar shape. For o-MBA
isomeric Au25 NCs, the CCS does not depend on the charge
state, while for m-MBA and p-MBA
isomeric Au25 NCs, the higher the charge state, the larger
the collision cross section. The change in cross section with the
charge state for m-MBA and p-MBA
may be correlated to the electron density on the negatively charged
carboxylic group (−COO–) located on the surface
of the NC which contributes to increase the CCSs, as observed by Dugourd,
Jarrold, and co-workers for indium cluster anions.36 This is also correlated to the observation of higher charge
states for these two species (Figure 1), with accommodation of electron density on the surface
of the clusters, while on the third species, charges are expected
to be localized within the ligand shell.

CID on gold NCs in
mass spectrometers was reported in previous
works for different charge states, in both positive and negative modes,
and with different ligands.25,37−40 Usually, whatever the ligand, CID experiments lead to dissociation
of the protecting ligand staples and formation of ions with higher-m/z ratios. Of note, the nature (protonation,
deprotonation, counterion adducts, etc) as well as the number of charges
affect the fragmentation pattern; however, the obtained fragments
are not sufficient for structural characterization. Figure 3 displays the CID breakdown
curves for the 4– charge state of Au25(MBA)18 for the three isomeric MBA ligands. For p-MBA, almost no fragmentation is observed as a function of the collision
energy (CE). Only a fragmentation yield of ∼2% is obtained
at 82 eV of CE. Au25 with m-MBA ligands
is found to be less stable than p-MBA ligands with
a fragmentation yield of ∼30% at the same CE. In great contrast,
Au25 with o-MBA ligands appears to be
dramatically more sensitive to collision activation. Fragmentation
is visible even for CE = 30%, and total depletion of the precursor
ion is reached yet at CE = 90 eV, leading to numerous fragments (see
Figure S5 in Supporting Information). For
each [Au25(MBA)18]4– precursor
ion, the main fragmentation pathways upon CID entail losses of Aux(MBA)y where x = 1 and y = 2 and, to a lesser extent, x = 2 and y = 3. It results in triply-charged
products in the 2200–2600 m/z range, and in the formation of the complementary singly-charged
oligomers [Au(MBA)2]− and [Au2(MBA)3]− in the m/z range of 500–1000.
These fragmentation patterns are very similar to those observed by
Brodbelt, Whetten, and co-workers on negatively charged Au25(p-MBA)18 by conventional CID and higher-energy
collisional dissociation.25 Of note, the
electron affinity of Au25(SR)18 was reported
to be as low as 2.2 eV,41 and thus the
electron detachment might compete with the CID. For [Au25(MBA)18]3– and [Au25(MBA)18]4– precursor ions, only fragmentation
channels are observed, while for [Au25(MBA)18]5– precursor ions (for the ortho isomer), electron
detachment from collisionally heated clusters competes with fragmentation.
These fragments contrast with those observed for multi-deprotonated
Au25(SG)18 ions by CID (SG for glutathione ligand),40 where the CID pathways involve successive losses
of pyroglutamic acid coming from cleavage and reorganization of the
glutamic acid side chain of SG. In this case, singly deprotonated
Au2(SG)2 and doubly deprotonated Au4(SG)4 cluster ions were observed.40

Figure 3 CID
breakdown curves for the 4– charge state of Au25(MBA)18 for the three isomeric MBA ligands as a function
of collision energy (CE).

Again, an isomeric effect of mercaptobenzoic acids on the
gas-phase
stability of Au25(MBA)18 NCs is observed. This
may be accounted for by the steric hindrance of the carboxylic groups
on the ligand shell. Indeed, m-MBA and, in particular, o-MBA ligands lead to a strong steric hindrance at the surface
of the gold core leading to constraint on the Au–S interface
that may reduce the binding energy for fragmentation through the Au–S
bond breaking. Another important parameter that can explain the difference
in CID breakdown curves for the 4– charge state of Au25(MBA)18 for the three isomeric MBA ligands is the difference
in the repulsive Coulomb energy42 between
the negative charges held by the carboxylic groups and the negative
charge held by the gold core. m-MBA and, in particular, o-MBA ligands will lead to stronger repulsive Coulomb energy
that might favor fragmentation. Importance of repulsive Coulomb energy
is emphasized by the charge state distributions in Figure 1 and CCS values.

In this
last section, we aim at evaluating the emissive properties
of Au25(MBA)18 isomers. For all Au25(MBA)18 isomeric clusters, we found no measurable one-photon
excited fluorescence [in the visible range] under UV–vis light
(350–500 nm excitation) both in the solid state and in solution,
meaning that the quantum yields (QYs) are much lower than 10–5 (limit of the sensitivity of our instrument). To our knowledge,
no fluorescence spectra were reported for gold clusters capped with
MBA as ligands, while, for instance, an NIR band centered at ∼700
nm is usually observed for Au25(SG)18 in water
with QY of ∼10–3.43 This result is puzzling. Indeed, MBA ligands possess all the ingredients
to enable fluorescence: (i) the benzene moiety allows for the ligand’s
capability of donating electron density to the metal core via the
S–Au bond (i.e., charge transfer capability of the ligand)
and (ii) the carboxylic group is an electron-rich group that can possibly
interact with the gold cluster surface (in particular with o-MBA isomer). However, the substituent in MBA (−SH,
−phenyl, and −COOH groups) allows for a strong mesomeric
effect, which tends to render in one hand more negative the carboxylic
group and on the other hand more positive the S atom. It was suggested
by Wu and Jin8 that the NIR fluorescence
in Au25SR18 originated from charge transfer
from the ligands to the metal nanoparticle core through the Au–S
bonds. This mesomeric effect (leading to more positive sulfur atom)
might avoid the charge transfer from the sulfur atom of the thiolate
ligand to the gold center, thus inhibiting the red fluorescence
band. Of note, this mesomeric effect is not supposed to affect the
metal–metal transition in the gold core (see below).

Interestingly, the Au25(MBA)18 NCs are nonfluorescent
in the visible range with a one-photon excitation, whereas an
intense two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) spectrum was observed
with an excitation at 800 nm. TPEF spectra for Au25(p-MBA)18, Au25(m-MBA)18, Au25(o-MBA)18, and
Au25(SG)18 are shown in Figure 4, and are compared to the TPEF spectrum of
fluorescein dye used as a reference. A broad band in the visible range
between 400 and 600 nm and centered at about 470 nm is observed, as
already reported for other gold–thiolate systems.44,45 Two-photon excitation involved different electronic transitions
than those involved in one-photon excitation.46 This two photon excited photoemission can be attributed to transitions
within the metal core.47 Interestingly,
TPEF spectra for Au25(p-MBA)18, Au25(m-MBA)18, Au25(o-MBA)18, and Au25(SG)18 are very similar both in band-shape and band intensity.
Because this band is thought to be due to transitions within the metal
core, the nature of the ligand is supposed not to play a significant
role, as experimentally observed. This is, as already outlined, totally
different than what is observed for one photon excitation fluorescence
which involves ligand-core excitation.

Figure 4 Two-photon excited fluorescence
(TPEF) spectra for Au25(MBA)18 isomer NCs (25
μM) and Au25(SG)18 NCs (25 μM) as
a function of wavelength for an excitation
wavelength at 800 nm. The TPEF spectrum of fluorescein (10 μM)
is given for comparison.

First, hyperpolarizability of the Au25(MBA)18 NCs was also obtained using the HRS technique.17 The HRS intensity was recorded for several concentrations
of the NCs dispersed in aqueous solutions (see Figure S6 in the Supporting Information), and short-range spectra
were recorded around the HRS wavelength. The hyperpolarizabilities
in units of 10–30 esu for Au25(p-MBA)18, Au25(m-MBA)18, and Au25(o-MBA)18 NCs were found to be 179 ± 18, 203 ± 20, and 214 ±
21, respectively. This slight relative increase in hyperpolarizabilities
might be the signature of slightly more asymmetric structures induced
by steric hindrance that increases between p-, m-, and o-MBA isomers. On the other hand,
MBA has an aromatic cycle with nonnegligible hyperpolarizability.
The latter will not be the same for the three isomers. The resulting
hyperpolarizability is therefore difficult to predict simply. Of note,
these values are only slightly higher than the one reported for Au25(SG)18 (128(1)) and Au25(cys)18 (163(4)).17 SG and cysteine (cys) are
chiral ligands, while MBA is not. Thus, the main contribution to hyperpolarizabilities
is not due to the chirality of the surface capping shell, but more
probably to ligand-induced asymmetry in the gold core structure. These
results contrast with the findings reported by Knoppe et al.18 where [Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)18]0 presented no measurable hyperpolarizability
values. This difference might be explained by the fact that in our
clusters, the gold core holds a negative charge (−1), while
in [Au25(SCH2CH2Ph)18],
the gold core is not charged. This negative charge might induce some
asymmetry in the gold core48 and might
be the key ingredient for enhanced hyperpolarizability observed for
[Au25(SR)18]−1 NCs.

3 Conclusions
In summary, Au25(MBA)18 NCs using the three
isomers of mercaptobenzoic acids (p/m/o-MBA) as capping ligands were synthesized using
a simple “bottom-up” size focusing two-step protocol.
An isomeric effect of mercaptobenzoic acids on the yield of synthesis
of Au25(MBA)18 NCs is observed and may be explained
qualitatively based on steric hindrance of the carboxylic group. The
relative stability of the gas-phase multiply deprotonated Au25(MBA)18 ions was investigated by CID. Again, an isomeric
effect of mercaptobenzoic acids on the gas-phase stability of Au25(MBA)18 NCs is observed which was attributed to
the Au–S interfacial bond stress. We also investigated their
optical properties. The absorption spectra of Au25(MBA)18 isomers were very similar and showed multiple bands at 690,
470, and 430 nm and are very similar to reported [Au25(SR)18]− NCs with different ligands. For all
Au25(MBA)18 isomeric clusters, we found no measurable
one-photon excited fluorescence under UV–vis light both in
the solid state and in solution. We also investigated their NLO properties
after two-photon absorption. Two-photon excited emission spectra and
first hyperpolarizabilities, as obtained by the HRS technique, of
these isomeric clusters are presented. It is found that the impact
of the charge on the symmetry of the gold core may be a key parameter
to the observed exaltation of the first hyperpolarizabilities of the
investigated clusters. The results are discussed in terms of the possible
isomeric effect on the metal-to-metal excitations and the ability
upon excitation of charge transfer from the ligands to the metal NC.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Tetrachloroauric(III)
acid
trihydrate(HAuCl4·3H2O), 4-mercaptobenzoic
acid(p-MBA), and 3-mercaptobenzoic acid (m-MBA) were obtained from Acros Organics; thiosalicylic
acid (2-mercaptobenzoic acid, o-MBA), tributylamine,
and ammonium acetate were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; borane–trimethylamine
complex was obtained from Alfa Aesar; and methanol and diethyl ether
were obtained from VWR. Milli-Q water with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ
cm was used for all experiments.

All glasswares were cleaned
with aqua-regia, rinsed with Milli-Q water, and dried before use.

4.2 Synthesis of Au25MBA18 Clusters
A similar synthetic condition was used for three
(para, meta, or ortho) mercaptobenzoic acid–gold clusters.

Mercaptobenzoic acid (5.1 mmol, 79 mg) is first dissolved in 40 mL
of methanol and 4 mL of tributylamine. Then, tetrachloroauric acid
trihydrate (2.54 mmol, 100 mg) is added at an ambient condition and
stirred 30mn to form a gold thiolate/tributylamine complex.

Then, to induce a slow reduction of gold, 200 mg of trimethylamine
borane is added under stirring for 2 h before adding another 200 mg.
The solution is left under stirring overnight for 24 h to achieve
the formation of the clusters.

Of note, tributylamine first
solubilizes clusters and precursors
in methanol. Without tributylamine (or with ammoniac), precipitation
occurs.

4.3 Purification
Precipitation of the
clusters is induced by adding 1 mL of 10% NH4OH solution
and 30 mL of diethyl ether. After centrifugation, the supernatant
which contains unwanted products is removed. Another cycle of dissolution/precipitation
(1 mL H2O; 5 mL of MeOH and 20 mL of Et2O) is
done.

Purification of the Au25(MBA)18 cluster
is done by selective precipitation. The precipitate is dissolved in
5 mL of water, and then 700 mg of ammonium acetate is added, followed
by 20 mL of MeOH. Under these conditions, a precipitate appears which
is separated by centrifugation. With m-MBA, very
few precipitates can be extracted and are essentially a mixture of
bigger clusters than Au25. With p-MBA,
this precipitate is essentially composed of Au36(p-MBA)24 with a good purity. For these two ligands,
Au25(MBA)18 is soluble in the supernatant and
can be precipitated by adding Et2O. With o-MBA, this precipitate is essentially Au25(MBA)18. The supernatant contains a population of smaller clusters. In all
cases, two cycles of dissolution/precipitation are done to improve
purity of the cluster at the end, the last one using a minimum of
water/MeOH precipitate by Et2O. At the end, the powder
is dried overnight at air.

4.4 Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
PAGE separation was carried out using a vertical gel electrophoresis
unit with a size of 0.2 cm × 20 cm × 20 cm. The separating
and stacking gels were prepared from acrylamide monomers with the
total contents of 35 and 7 wt %, respectively [acrylamide–bis(acrylamide)
94:6]. The eluting buffer is a standard TBE buffer (89 mM
Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid). The
as-prepared Au(MBA) clusters were dissolved in a 15% (v/v) glycerol/water
solution (6 mg in 100 μL). The sample solutions were loaded
onto the stacking gel (10 μL per well) and eluted for 7 h at
a constant voltage mode (150 V) to achieve sufficient separation.

4.5 Ion Mobility and Mass Spectrometry (IM–MS)
IM–MS measurement was performed on a home-built setup described
elsewhere49 and is based on a Maxis Impact
Quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker, Bremen, Germany).
Solutions were prepared in water at a concentration of approximately
25 μM and directly sprayed using the original electrospray source
of the instrument. The source was operated at relatively low drying
gas temperature (80 °C), and all ion transfer optics were set
to gentle conditions in order to minimize cluster fragmentation. Namely,
the amplitude of the radiofrequency voltages and the dc gradients
along the path were minimized.

MS and tandem-MS measurements
were done by turning off the ion bunching in the IMS cell, and then
allowing continuous injection of the ions in the Bruker instrument.
CID experiments were done in the tandem-MS mode by selecting the ions
using a quadrupole filter before injecting them in a collision cell
filled with nitrogen as a collision gas. Fragment ions were finally
detected after a time-of-flight measurement. The CE was varied by
controlling the voltage drop between the exit lens of the quadrupole
and the entrance lens of the collision cell. The CEs reported in the
paper are given to allow comparison between the different species,
taking into account both the voltage drop Vcoll and the charge z of the ions: CE = zVcoll.

Ion mobility measurements were done using
a 79 cm-long drift tube
filled with 4.0 Torr helium at room temperature. The arrival time
of the ions was recorded as a function of the drift voltage across
the tube (from 150 to 500 V), thus allowing absolute cross section
(CCS) measurements based on the Mason–Schamp equation.50 We estimated the overall error on the absolute
value determined by this procedure to be 2%.

4.6 Absorption
and Emission Measurements
UV–vis spectra in solution
were recorded using an AvaSpec-2048
fiber optic spectrometer and an AvaLight-DH-S deuterium halogen light
source. Fluorescence spectra were measured using a Fluoromax-4 HORIBA
fluorescence spectrophotometer.

4.7 HRS and
TPEF Measurements
The light
source for the present HRS and TPEF experiments was a mode-locked
femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser delivering at the fundamental wavelength
of 800 nm pulses with a duration of about 140 fs at a repetition rate
of 76 MHz. After passing through a low-pass filter to remove any unwanted
harmonic light generated prior to the cell, the fundamental beam of
about 300 mW was focused by a microscope objective into a 1 cm spectrophotometric
cell containing the aqueous solution. The HRS (or TPEF) light was
collected at an angle of 90° from the incident direction by a
2.5 cm focal length lens. The second harmonic light was separated
from its linear counterpart by a high-pass filter and a monochromator
positioned at the second harmonic wavelength. The HRS light was then
detected with a photomultiplier tube (model H11890-210, Hamamatsu)
and the pulses produced were counted with a photon counter.
