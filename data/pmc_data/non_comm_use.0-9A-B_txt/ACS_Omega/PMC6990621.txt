In
this work, we demonstrate Mn-promoted growth of oxide nanostructures
standing on a single-crystal MgAl2O4 substrate
after heat treatment. Unlike the short truncated spinel pyramids under
Au seeds, the addition of Mn produces spinel nanopillars with lengths
of 100–300 nm and pyroxene nanowires up to 10 μm. Compared
to Au seeds, Au/Mn seeds have different adsorption behavior and therefore
provide an additional mass transfer path along seed surfaces that
promotes the growth of nanostructures. This vaporization approach
has a potential of being applicable to a wide range of complicated
oxides.

Introduction
Vertically aligned
oxide nanowires on substrates have attracted
extensive attention because of their potential applications such as
solar cells,1,2 light-emitting devices,3,4 field-emission devices,5−7 and piezoelectric nanogenerators.8 Up to now, a variety of synthesis techniques
have been developed for the growth of well-aligned oxide nanowires
including vapor deposition,9,10 thermal oxidation,11,12 laser ablation,13 and solvothermal method,14,15 most of which focus on simple metal oxides such as ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3, and In2O3. Recently, a new method has been developed and successfully applied
to TiO2 and ZnO.16 This method
utilizes vaporization products of oxide substrates, which can be adsorbed
and transported along seed surface, to grow single-crystal oxide nanowires.
With high quality in nanowire crystallinity and simplicity in experiment
settings, this technique shows promise in fabricating various standing
oxide nanowires.

In this study, we extend this method to a multicomponent
oxide,
MgAl2O4. Compared to TiO2 nanowires
(length > 5 μm), the MgAl2O4 substrate
grows into pyramid-shaped MgAl2O4 bases, with
a height typically less than 20 nm under identical growth temperature
and Au seeds.17,18 It is worth noting that no adsorbate
is observed at seed surfaces in the case of MgAl2O4 with pure Au seeds;18,19 in contrast, thin adsorbate
layers appear at seed surfaces for TiO2 and ZnO nanowires.16 This work is motivated by promoting the growth
of MgAl2O4 through tailoring the characteristics
of seed surface. Another seed element is added according to its phase
diagram with Au and its solubility in MgAl2O4. Therefore, Mn is chosen in order to (i) form seed particles with
adsorption behavior differing from pure gold and (ii) have a controllable
influence on oxide structure. Consequently, two types of longer nanostructures
are obtained with Au/Mn seeds. Nanopillars 100–300 nm in length
inherit the spinel structure of the substrate, while, another type
of nanowire with a few microns in length is identified as pyroxene
MgSiO3, which is an important substance for petrogenetic
indicators20 and silicate glasses.21 Although the introduction of Si from the quartz
tube is not anticipated, the growth mechanism of the above two nanostructures
is of particular interest and will be discussed here.

Results and Discussion
Morphology
and Composition of Samples
The synthesis
of oxide nanostructures was facilitated via heat treatment of Au-coated
MgAl2O4 substrates in inert gas with Mn powder
added to the other end of a closed quartz tube. The epitaxial regrowth
of the MgAl2O4 substrate under pure Au seeds
is depicted in Figure 1c. Interestingly, with Mn added to the system, significant growth
of nanostructures is observed after heat treatment at identical experiment
settings. As shown in the SEM micrograph in Figure 1a and high-angle annular dark-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) micrograph in Figure 1b, two types of nanostructures
are distributed on substrate surface. The shorter type is denoted
as type A nanopillars, and the other type with a length of a few microns
is referred to as type B nanowires. Both types have similar diameters
of less than 200 nm, constrained by the size of distinct seeds on
the top. A gradual change in the diameter of nanostructures is observed.
For type A, there is a cap-like region adjacent to the seed, whereas
type B nanowire has a necking region at the bottom (see the HAADF
image in Figure 1f).

nm in panels (a,c), 250 nm in panel (b), and 30 nm in panels (d–f).

From energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)
mappings shown
in Figure 1d–f,
all the seeds are composed of Au, Mn, and trace Mg, Al, and Si; while
the body of nanostructures consists of Mg, Al, Mn, Si, and O. In particular,
unlike Al-rich nanopillars, the nanowires are deficient in Al except
the necking area. In order to obtain precise composition of the nanostructures,
elemental quantification is performed using Bruker Esprit software,
and the results are presented in Figure 1g. According to the relative atomic ratios
between elements, namely, Mn/Au and X/Mg (X = Al, Mn, Si, O), most
particles are AuMn and a few of them are AuMn2. The bottom
of nanopillars and the necking region of nanowires have similar compositions
with a Mg:Al:O ratio that is approximately equal to 1:2:4 and trace
Si and Mn. Specially, the body region of type A nanowires is close
to Mg:Si:O = 1:1:3 with a minority of Al and Mn, whereas in nanopillars,
the cap region has a higher concentration of Si than in the bottom.
It should be noted that the quantified atom percentage of oxygen may
not be fully reliable in EDS. Except the quartz tube (99.99% SiO2), no other source of Si exists in the current system that
only contains high-purity Mn powder and single-crystal MgAl2O4. The unexpected Si probably originates from the quartz
tube at high temperature, likely associated with the existence of
manganese because Si is not detected in the grown pyramids in understudied
systems without manganese (i.e., the pyramids shown in Figure 1c).

Crystal Structures of the
Nanopillars and Nanowires
The detailed structures of the
two types are carefully examined with
a transmission electron microscope (TEM) as seen from Figures 2 and 3. As shown in the diffraction pattern (DP) and lattice fringes in
high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) micrographs in Figure 2b,c, the nanopillars have a cubic spinel
structure, which is the same as bulk spinel substrates, and grow along
the <111> direction. Thus, the spinel nanopillars probably have
an epitaxial orientation relationship with the (111)-oriented MgAl2O4 substrate. In addition, X-ray diffraction results
indicate only the (111)-oriented spinel. It should be noted that the
weak signals from nanopillars can be submerged in the strong substrate
signal, leading to nondetectable orientations of nanopillars in XRD.

phase, and the HRTEM simulations inserted are calculated from the
orthopyroxene structure with a multislice approach. The defocus value
and sample thickness are 77 and 50.58 nm in panel (a) and 107 and
31.08 nm in panel (b). The scale bar in TEM micrographs is 20 nm.
(c) The [010] projections of the three polymorphs of MgSiO3 generated by Vesta28 including ICSD 9328,
ICSD 30808, and ICSD 30893.

In addition, the interface between the particle and the grown oxide
is not atomic sharp, forming a transition region that overlaps the
two parts. Another feature is the asymmetric shape of the cap, indicating
an unbalanced growth along the axis that may account for the deviation
from substrate normal as observed in Figure 1a. In order to reveal the variations in structures,
energy loss electron spectra (EELS) are acquired across the interface
with O-K and Mn-L2,3 edges recorded simultaneously in Figure 3d,e. The O-K edges
far away from the interface can be fingerprinted to MgAl2O4 spinel.22,23 As it approaches the interface,
the shoulder feature of the predominant peak remains until in the
cap region where the shoulder becomes a sharp peak with a reducing
intensity. This new feature mimics the shape of fourfold coordinated
Si in quartz and some silicates such as forsterite,24−26 indicating
a structure change over this region. On the other hand, no visible
change except the intensity is observed for Mn-L2,3 edge
at 640 and 650 eV. Notably, the highest counts of Mn-L2,3 signals are recorded near the interface, implying an enrichment
of Mn at the growth front.

Figure 3 presents
experimental DPs and HRTEM micrographs of type B nanowires along different
zone axes (another two sets of DPs and corresponding DP simulations
can be found in Figure S1). After examining
the DP simulations of all stable phases (>20) reported in the Inorganic
Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) that contain Mg, Si, Mn, Al, and
O, we believe that the crystal structure of type B is orthopyroxene-MgSiO3 (more details in the Supporting Information and Figure S2). This is further verified by the good
agreement between experimental and simulated HRTEM micrographs inserted
in Figure 3a,b. It
is worth noting that the (100) planar defects can be observed in most
nanowires viewed along the [010] zone axis, leading to the existence
of non-integer reflections and streaks parallel to (100) in the DPs.
Such stacking faults have been previously reported during phase transformations
between polymorphs of MgSiO3, likely the transition from
protoenstatite (Pbcn, 1300–1850 K) to orthoenstatite
(Pbca, 400–1300 K) or low-clinoenstatite (P21/c)27 considering the pressure and temperature conditions in our case.
Based on the cation distribution reported in the pyroxene group (general
formula XYZ2O6, where X represents the distorted
M2 site, Y represents octahedral sites, and Z represents tetrahedral
sites),20 we believe that Si occupies tetrahedral
sites, Mn prefers M2 sites, and Mg and Al can be located in both M1
and M2 sites accompanying cation disorder.

According to the
diffraction patterns of multiple nanowires (>20),
type B nanowires grow along the [001] direction. The angle between
the type B nanowires and the substrate is approximately 82° (see
the measurement from SEM images in Figure S3 and the scheme in Figure 4b). Although type B nanowires have a preferential growth direction
with respect to the spinel bases, no clear evidence regarding lattice
matching exists between orthopyroxene-MgSiO3 and MgAl2O4 lattices (see the atomic models inserted in Figure 4b).

relative amount of corresponding gaseous species. In the atomic models
of spinel and orthopyroxene, red, cyan, orange, and blue spheres are
O, Al, Mg, and Si, respectively.

Growth Mechanism of the Oxide Nanostructures
Taken
together, type A nanopillars have a spinel structure with higher content
of Si in the cap region, and type B nanowires are orthopyroxene MgSiO3 with a spinel bottom that is close to MgAl2O4 (EDS quantification errors are 5–10% for O and 2–5%
for the remaining elements). Within this closed tube, the source materials
for these nanostructures can be (i) solid MgAl2O4 substrate, (ii) manganese powder, and (iii) the quartz tube (99.99%
SiO2). With pure Au seeds, the formation of a short truncated
pyramid base is proposed to result from surface diffusion of the substrate
at elevated temperatures (see Figure 4a).17,29 According to the shape differences
appearing at the roots of the nanostructures (see Figure S5), the above bases also form at the beginning growth
stage of the present two nanostructures. In addition, thin oxide layers
are observed at the surface of nanoseeds and are alike for both nanostructures
(see quantified mappings in Figure S4).
With the significant O layer and weak sparse signals of Mg, Al, and
Si, particularly in the regions close to the interface, mass transfer
of oxide clusters along the seed surface is believed to play an important
role in the growth of multicomponent oxide nanopillars and nanowires.

At growth temperature (1373 K), the vaporization products are primarily
Mg, Mn, O, SiO, Au, and a smaller amount of Al with corresponding
equilibrium pressures listed in Table 1. The oxidation species of AlO and Al2O
are negligible here because they are a few orders of magnitude less
than Al and O2 species,33,34 and the vapor
of Au is not considered here due to its limited contribution to the
growth of nanostructures. Due to the incongruent vaporization of MgAl2O4, the concentration of Al in an argon atmosphere
is 3 orders less than those of Mg and SiO, which leads to Al-deficient
MgSiO3 nanowires. This phase is connected to the spinel
base through the cap region, which is likely to be a mixture of orthopyroxene
and spinel structure. The major composition of this cap region, Mg-Al-Si-O,
favors the formation of both aluminous orthopyroxene35 and Si-doped MgAl2O4 spinel that
has been reported by Hashishin et al.36 despite the lack of thermodynamic data. As a result, micron-scale
pyroxene nanowires will continuously grow under some of the seeds
if pyroxene nucleates at the droplet–cap interface.

Conclusions
Two types of nanostructures grow simultaneously on the MgAl2O4 substrate promoted by additive Mn. The shorter
nanopillars are 100–300 nm in length with a structure of cubic
spinel, and the micron-scale nanowires are determined as Mn- and Al-doped orthoenstatite MgSiO3. The formation of Au/Mn seeds makes it possible to collect the vaporization
products via surface adsorption and mass transfer. This thermal vaporization
route opens up possibilities for synthesizing multicomponent oxide
nanowires.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Single-crystal (111) MgAl2O4 substrates were purchased from MTI Corp.

Synthesis
of Oxide Nanostructures
The synthesis of
oxide nanostructures was facilitated via heat treatment in inert gas.
In detail, a Au film was deposited with a thickness of 10 nm. The
as-prepared substrate was then transferred to the center of a quartz
tube (one end closed, 15 cm in length and 1 cm in diameter) in which
an excess of Mn powder (0.1–0.5 grams, analytical grade) was
placed at the closed end. After filling with Ar at a pressure of 200
torr, the open end of the tube was sealed with a flame. Subsequently,
this enclosed vessel was loaded to the isothermal region of a tube
furnace and heated to 1100 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. With
increasing temperature, dewetted Au particles formed and further mixed
with Mn. After maintaining at 1100 °C for 60 min, the quartz
tube was slowly cooled to room temperature.

Characterization Techniques
Scanning electron micrographs
were obtained with a Zeiss Ultra Plus field-emission scanning electron
microscope (SEM) operated at 5–15 kV. Prior to SEM observation,
a 10 nm carbon layer was coated on the surface of spinel substrates
using an ion sputter and carbon coating unit (E-1045, Hitachi, Japan).
Transmission electron micrographs were acquired using an FEI Talos
F200X operated at 200 kV. Chemical analysis of prepared nanostructures
was obtained using a Super-X EDS system with four SDD detectors. The
electron energy loss spectra (EELS) were measured using a spherical-aberration-corrected
FEI Titan 80-300 HB. For TEM characterization, nanostructures were
scraped from the substrate with TEM copper grids.
