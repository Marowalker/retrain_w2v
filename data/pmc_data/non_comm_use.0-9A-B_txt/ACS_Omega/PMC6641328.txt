Transition metal
oxides, such as Co3O4, have
attracted great attention for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to
their high theoretical capacity and satisfactory chemical stability.
However, the slow kinetics of Li-ion and electron transport as well
as poor cycling stability still largely restrains their applications.
Here, we report the rational design of well-defined mesoporous ultrathin
Co3O4 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) by topological
transformation of layered double hydroxides nanosheet arrays (NSAs),
which demonstrate significantly enhanced performance as anode for
LIBs. The as-obtained Co3O4 NSAs with suitable
thickness and abundant mesopores show excellent electrochemistry performance
for LIBs, giving a high specific charge capacity of 2019.6 mAh g–1 at 0.1 A g–1, a good rate capability,
and a remarkable cycling stability (1576.9 mAh g–1 after the 80th cycle), which is much superior to that of Co3O4 with thicker or thinner nanosheets as well as
to that of the reported results. This facile strategy may be extended
to the synthesis of other transition metal oxide NSAs, which can be
potentially used in energy storage and conversion devices.

Introduction
Nowadays, rechargeable
batteries have gradually become indispensable
for advanced electrochemical energy storage systems, such as portable
electronic devices and electric vehicles.1−3 Typically, lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) have long been employed as an attractive power source
due to their low cost, high energy density, and satisfactory cycling
stability.4,5 In practice, the energy output of LIBs is
usually determined by their electrode materials, and in particular,
one of the main challenges in the investigation of LIBs is to increase
the capacity of anode materials.6−9 To date, extensive attempts have been focused on
the advanced anode by rational materials design, including construction
of mesoporous architectures or conductive channels. For instance,
hierarchical materials with mesoporous nanostructures can significantly
improve the electrochemical performance of LIBs owing to their abundant
exposure to active sites and increased transport of Li ions.10−12 Although much progress has been made, developing anode materials
with large energy density and long endurance is still essential for
high-performance LIBs.

Transition metal oxides have been investigated
as promising anode
materials for LIBs.13−15 Among various types of transition metal oxides, Co3O4 has attracted considerable attention due to
their cost effectiveness and high theoretical capacity. However, the
practical application of Co3O4 is still largely
restrained by the slow kinetics of Li-ion and electron transport as
well as poor cycling stability (large volume change and severe particle
aggregation).16,17 Recently, two-dimensional (2D)
ultrathin materials, with the advantages of high surface-to-mass ratio
and unique physicochemical properties, have drawn increasing research
interest in electrochemical energy field. Considering the merits of
2D materials, if ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets
can be constructed by virtue of material exploration and fabrication
strategy, a promising electrochemical performance would be achieved
due to highly exposed surface atoms for faradic redox reactions. In
addition, an elaborate ultrathin architecture also shortens the diffusion
pathway of lithium ions, which guarantess a fast mass/electron transport.

Herein, the well-defined mesoporous ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) have been successfully fabricated
via topological transformation of layered double hydroxide (LDH) precursor,
which shows significantly enhanced performance as anode for LIBs.
The CoIICoIII–LDH NSAs with various thicknesses
were first obtained via a facile electrochemical synthesis method,18 which thereby can be transformed to well-distributed
mesoporous Co3O4 NSAs with ultrathin thickness
ranging from 2 to 10 nm. Moreover, a “thickness-dependent LIBs
performance” has been demonstrated by using Co3O4 NSAs as anode. Co3O4 NSAs with a thickness
of 3 nm give the best performance with a maximum specific capacity
(2019.6 mAh g–1) and satisfactory stability. It
is worth mentioning that the optimal specific capacity of ultrathin
Co3O4 NSAs is relatively high compared to that
of Co3O4 anodes ever reported. In addition,
this facile strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other ultrathin
transition metal oxide NAs with potential application in energy storage
and conversion.

Results and Discussion
Well-defined
mesoporous ultrathin Co3O4 NSAs
were fabricated through a topological transformation process (Figure 1A). Various CoIICoIII–LDH NSAs with different thicknesses
on nickel foam substrates were first synthesized by using a rapid
electrosynthesis method, which was further transformed to ultrathin
Co3O4 NSAs via subsequent calcination treatment
at 450 °C in air for 2 h. Figure 1B illustrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
of the CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 and
Co3O4-T2 samples on the Ni foil substrate.
CoIICoIII–LDH NSAs show a typical LDH
phase with clear reflection peaks at 11.7, 23.5, 34.8, 59.7, and 60.9°,
corresponding to the (003), (006), (012), (110), and (113) reflections
of CoIICoIII–LDH. After calcination,
the original LDH peaks are replaced by a series of new reflections
at 19.0, 31.3, 36.8, 59.4, and 65.2°, corresponding to the (111),
(220), (311), (511), and (440) reflections of Co3O4.19−21 This indicates the successful transition from CoIICoIII–LDH to Co3O4. In addition, XRD patterns of CoIICoIII–LDH-T1, -T3 and Co3O4-T1, -T3 are shown in Figure S1, which show the same peak position with the corresponding precursors
CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 and Co3O4-T2, respectively. In addition, the
very weak reflection peak at 43.3° and relatively smooth surface
(Figures S2 and S3) demonstrated that just
limited NiO was formed from the Ni substrate under this heating condition. Figure 1C illustrates the
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of CoIICoIII–LDH and Co3O4 powder collected
from Ni foil substrate. The broad intense band at about 3450 cm–1 for CoIICoIII–LDH is
due to the OH stretching mode of the hydroxyl groups in the host layers
and the interlayer water molecules. The strong bands at 1383 and 662
cm–1 correspond to the absorption peak of intercalated
nitrate anions and Co–O vibration of CoIICoIII–LDH. After calcination, the characteristic peaks
of CoIICoIII–LDH disappear; two strong
absorption bands at 660 and 567 cm–1 are observed,
corresponding to the absorption peak of Co–O vibration of Co3O4.22

for the synthesis of Co3O4 NSAs with different
thicknesses; (B) XRD patterns and (C)
FT-IR spectra of CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 and Co3O4 NSAs-T2.

The morphologies of CoIICoIII–LDH
and the obtained Co3O4 NSAs were investigated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). It was observed that the thickness of the as-obtained CoIICoIII–LDH decreased from 10 to 2 nm along
with the decrease of cobalt nitrate concentration in the electrosynthesized
electrolyte (denoted CoIICoIII–LDH-T1, -T2, and -T3, respectively; Figure 2A–C). Figure 2D–F shows
the SEM images of the corresponding Co3O4 NSAs
(denoted Co3O4-T1, -T2, and -T3). It can be observed that the original vertically
aligned nanosheet nanostructure is well-maintained for the Co3O4-T1 (Figure 2D) and Co3O4-T2 (Figure 2E).
However, the nanoplatelet structure is destroyed when the LDH precursor
is too thin (Co3O4-T3; Figure 2F). The TEM images (Figure 2G–I) for the
obtained Co3O4 NSAs demonstrate the presence
of uniform mesopores for the sample with medium thickness (Co3O4-T2), probably resulting from the
dehydration and phase transformation of LDH nanosheets. In contrast,
the Co3O4 NSAs with thicker nanosheets (Co3O4-T1) display limited mesopores, whereas
the thinner Co3O4 (Co3O4-T3) NSAs give larger pores due to the serious collapse
of the sheetlike nanostructure. The Co3O4 NSAs
with different thicknesses and porous structures were further investigated
by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Figure 3A, the sample of Co3O4-T1 NSAs shows a thickness of ∼10 nm, consistent
with the TEM results. After decreasing the thickness of LDH precursor,
the thickness of the obtained Co3O4 nanosheet
obviously decreases to 3 nm for Co3O4-T2 NSAs (Figure 3B) and to 2 nm for Co3O4-T3 NSAs
(Figure 3C). Compared
to that of Co3O4-T1 NSA and Co3O4-T3 NSA samples, the Co3O4-T2 NSA sample displays a more ordered ultrathin
platelike structure with uniform pores.

(STEM) image and (F) corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry

The detailed crystal structure and composition
of the ultrathin
CoIICoIII–LDH and Co3O4 NSAs were characterized by HRTEM and scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM). Figure S4A shows
the ultrathin LDH nanosheet structure, and the d-spacing from high
resolution (Figure S4B) is about 0.25 nm,
corresponding to the LDH (012) plane, which is consistent with the
XRD pattern of CoIICoIII–LDH-T2.

As shown in STEM image (Figure 3D), the (111) and (311) planes with well-resolved
lattice
fringes of 0.467 and 0.24 nm are identified, indicating the high purity
of the obtained Co3O4 NSAs. The same results
can also be observed from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
image, which shows three clear quasi-single-crystalline patterns with d-spacings of 0.467, 0.28, and 0.24 nm, corresponding to
the (111), (220), and (311) planes of Co3O4 (Figure 3D, inset). Scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of Co3O4 NSAs and the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry
(EDS) mapping verify the well-distributed elements of cobalt and oxygen
(Figure 3E,F).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to demonstrate
the composition and valence state of the precursor CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 and as-obtained Co3O4-T2 sample. As shown in Figure 4A, the full XPS spectra of
CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 and Co3O4-T2 NSAs reveal signals of O 1s and
Co 2p at 531.4 and 782.6 eV, respectively, indicating the existence
of oxygen and cobalt elements in both samples. The XPS data of CoIICoIII–LDH-T1, -T3 and Co3O4-T1, -T3 are
shown in Figures S5 and S6, which show
nearly the same peak position with CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 and Co3O4-T2, respectively. The high-resolution Co 2p XPS spectra (Figure 4B, bottom curves) of CoIICoIII–LDH-T2 show two types
of Co spaces at 796.5 and 797.6 eV, which can be attributed to Co2+ and Co3+. A similar result can also be observed
on the Co 2p3/2 XPS spectrum (the peaks at 782.5 and 780.8
eV can be attributed to Co2+ and Co3+, respectively),
indicating the presence of both Co2+ and Co3+ oxidation states in CoIICoIII–LDH NSAs-T2. After calcination of CoIICoIII–LDH
NSAs-T2, both Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks shift to a lower energy level: Co 2p1/2 peak moves
to 796 eV (Co2+) and 794.6 eV (Co3+) (Figure 5B, top curves), and
Co 2p3/2 peak moves to 782.5 eV (Co2+) and 780.8
eV (Co3+). The O 1s spectrum (Figure S6) displays two peaks at 531.4 and 532.1 eV for CoIICoIII–LDH, but shifts to 529 and 530 eV for Co3O4, which indicate the formation of Co3O4.23,24

The electrochemical performance of the well-defined mesoporous
ultrathin Co3O4 NSAs as an anode material for
LIB was further studied. The CV curve for the Co3O4-T2 NSAs was first carried out at a scan rate of
0.1 mV s–1 with the potential window of 0.005–3.0
V. As shown in Figure 5A, two cathodic peaks appear in the first cycle at ∼0.5 and
0.8 V for Co3O4-T2 NSAs and disappear
in the subsequent cycles, which are attributed to the formation of
solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film.25 During the anodic scan, a peak located at ∼2.2 V is observed,
which can be ascribed to the oxidation of metallic Co to Co3O4 and the decomposition of Li2O. The reversible
progress of charge and discharge can be expressed as follows26  In the second cycle, the reduction
peak shifts
to a higher potential at ∼1.0 V, whereas the oxidation peak
position is almost unchanged. In the further subsequent cycles, the
CV curves show good reproducibility and similar shapes, suggesting
a high reversibility of lithium storage.27Figure 5B demonstrates
the potential–capacity curves tested at a current rate of 0.1
A g–1. The irreversible capacity in the initial
discharge process can be ascribed to the formation of SEI film, which
is consistent with the CV results (Figure 5A). In contrast, the charge–discharge
curves remain almost coincident in the subsequent cycles, indicating
a good reversibility and cycle stability for the Co3O4 NSAs. It is worth noting that Co3O4-T1 and Co3O4-T3 NSAs
(Figure S7A,C) exhibit similar voltage
plateaus compared to that of Co3O4-T2 in the charge and discharge curves but give a clear lower specific
capacity. This demonstrates that the thickness of Co3O4 NSAs plays a key role in determining their electrochemical
properties. In contrast, the CV curve for the pristine Ni foam substrate
after calcination is also explored (Figure S8A). It is clear that the Ni foam has almost no capacity contribution,
and the calcined substrate just gives limited capacity (<5% of
the value of Co3O4 NSAs supported on Ni foam),
which is consistent with the result of potential–capacity curves
(Figure S8B).

The rate capability
and cycling performance of the as-obtained
Co3O4 NSAs under different current densities
were determined. The charge–discharge platforms for all of
the samples at different current densities are similar (Figures 5C and S7B,D), indicating the same electrochemical pathways. Figure 5D shows the rate
capability of Co3O4 NSAs with different thicknesses.
The Co3O4-T2 NSAs give discharge
capacities of 2019.6, 1904.6, 1622.3, 1176.7, and 632.7 mAh g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g–1, respectively. Along with the current density going back to 0.1
A g–1 after several cycles, the capacity of the
Co3O4-T2 NSAs recovers to 1753.8
mAh g–1, exhibiting promising rate capability. In
contrast, the Co3O4-T1 NSAs and Co3O4-T3 NSAs display relatively lower
capabilities of 1261.1 and 1762 mAh g–1, respectively,
at 0.1 A g–1. These values just remain at 987.4
and 1523.7 mAh g–1, respectively, when back to 0.1
A g–1 after a few cycles, which further indicates
that the suitable thickness of Co3O4 anode can
effectively facilitate Li+ insertion/extraction processes.
The bulk Co3O4 with a thickness of ∼40
nm has also been synthesized (Figure S9), which gives discharge capacities of 814.6, 759.2, 537, 333, and
159 mAh g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g–1, respectively. Along with the current density going back to 0.1
A g–1 after several cycles, the capacity of bulk
Co3O4 recovers to 566.45 mAh g–1, which shows obvious poor rate performance compared to that of mesoporous
ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets. The Co3O4 NSAs also show superior initial and reversible capacities
compared to those of the reported Co3O4 anodes,
to the best of our knowledge (Figure S10).28−36 It is worth mentioning that the theoretical capacity of Co3O4 has been reported to be 890 mAh g–1, which is obviously less than that of the synthesized Co3O4 NSAs. This similar result has also been reported previously,
where the capacities of Co3O4 ranged from 970
to 1615.8 mAh g–1. The clearly improved capacity
compared with the theoretical values can be ascribed to the varied
nanostructures, which change the Li+ storage sites and
capacities.31

The cycling performance
of the Co3O4 NSAs
at a current density of 0.1 A g–1 is shown in Figure 5E. The first irreversible
capacity loss can be ascribed to the formation of the SEI film during
the first discharge. From the second cycle, the Coulombic efficiencies
for all of the Co3O4 NSA samples reach nearly
100%. Moreover, the Co3O4-T2 NSAs
retain a remarkable reversible capacity of 1576.9 mAh g–1 at the end of the 80th cycle, corresponding to a capacity decay
of 0.28% per cycle. However, the Co3O4-T1 and Co3O4-T3 NSAs give 0.65
and 0.70% loss of capacity per cycle, respectively. The cycling stability
of the Co3O4 NSAs at a higher current rate (1.0
A g–1) is further studied (Figure S11). The capacities of Co3O4-T1, -T2 and -T3 have reached a steady state after
200 cycles at 1 A g−1, which maintains 31.7%, 38.5%,
37% of their initial capacities, respectively, after 500 cycles. This
demonstrates that the Co3O4 with ultrathin thickness
also displays a higher capacity and improved stability at a high current.
The independent nanosheet structure would relieve agglomeration and
collapse during the cycle. Moreover, the porous structure provides
more active sites and an expanded volume during the reaction.37 For further understanding, we disassembled the
battery after the 80th cycle and observed the morphology of the Co3O4 NSAs by SEM (Figure S12). We found that the nanosheet array structure of the Co3O4-T2 NSAs is still maintained, which proves
that suitable thickness of the nanosheet with abundant mesopores suppresses
structure collapse and aggregation during the charging/discharging
process.

To further understand the improved lithium storage
performance
of Co3O4 NSAs, the electrochemical surface area
(ECSA) of Co3O4 with different thicknesses was
studied. The ECSA provides information of active surface areas, which
can be determined by using double-layer capacitance (Cdl) (Figure S13). It is hard to determine
the ECSA of Co3O4 in the battery electrolyte.
Alternatively, we obtained this value in the 1 M KOH solution, which
also can reveal the trend of the active site exposure for the Co3O4 with different nanostructures. It was found
that the Cdl of Co3O4 NSAs increases
first along with the increase of thickness from 2 to 10 nm, but it
decreases by further increasing the NSA thickness (Figure 6A). This indicates that a suitable
thickness of Co3O4 NSAs improves their electrochemical
surface area and results in enhanced Li+ insertion/extraction.
Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra
of Co3O4 provide additional information about
the charge transport properties. As shown in Figure 6B, the Nyquist plots for all of the Co3O4 NSAs possess a semicircle in the high-frequency
region and a straight line in the low-frequency region. The obviously
depressed semicircle for the Co3O4-T2 NSAs indicates a decreased charge transport resistance. The increased
slope of the Co3O4 NSAs with medium thickness
also implies the enhanced Li+ diffusion in the electrode.
As reported in previous works,38−41 the total capacity of an electrode can be divided
into three charge-storage mechanisms: Li+ insertion process,
pseudocapacitance effect, and double-layer effect. The degree of capacitive
effect can be indicated by analyzing the relationship between measured
current (i) and scan rate (ν) from the CV data.
The equations are listed as follows:    When the b-value
is 0.5,
the charge-storage mechanism is considered as the diffusion process;
however, when the b-value is 1.0, capacitive response
is the main charge-storage mechanism. Figure S14B show CVs of Co3O4-T2 at different
scanning rates; the calculated b-values are 0.56
and 0.535 (close to 0.5) at 1.0 and 1.1 V during the cathodic process
(Figure 6C), indicating
a main charge-storage mechanism of the diffusion process. In other
potential window, the b-values range from 0.7 to
1.0, which implies that a part of capacity comes from pseudocapacitive
effects.

for Co3O4-T1, -T2, -T3 NSAs. (C) Calculated b-values as a function
of voltage for cathodic and anodic sweeps for Co3O4-T2 NSAs. (D) Relationship between peak current
and the square root of scan rate. (E) Schematic illustration for the
discharge process of Co3O4 NSAs with different
thicknesses (left: thick, inefficient utilization; right: thin, efficient
utilization).

To further clarify the
effects of thickness on the ionic transport
properties, the apparent diffusion coefficient of Li-ion (DLi) was evaluated for Co3O4-T1, -T2, -T3 NSAs (see the Supporting Information for detailed calculations).
The peak current demonstrates a linear relationship with the square
root of scan rate (Figures 6D and S14). The different slopes
of the Co3O4 NSAs imply the varied ability of
Li+ diffusion in the electrode. According to the relationship
of the peak current and the CV sweep rate, DLi+ of Co3O4-T1, -T2, -T3 NSAs are calculated to be 2.99 ×
10–10, 5.44 × 10–10, and
1.67 × 10–10 cm2 s–1. The Co3O4-T2 NSAs show the largest
ion diffusion coefficient, demonstrating a thickness-dependent Li+ storage property. Thus, the Co3O4 NSAs
exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical properties, which can
be ascribed to the shortened lithium-ion transport distance within
the nanosheets as well as fully utilized active sites during charging/discharging
processes (Figure 6E).

Conclusions
In summary, ultrathin mesoporous Co3O4 NSAs
were successfully prepared by calcining the precursor CoIICoIII–LDH NSAs, which showed an ordered sheetlike
nanostructure and uniform mesopore distribution. The as-obtained Co3O4-T2 NSAs with suitable ultrathin thickness
and abundant mesopores show an excellent electrochemistry performance
for LIBs, giving a high specific charge capacity of 2019.6 mAh g–1 at 0.1 A g–1, a good rate capability,
and a remarkable cycling stability (1576.9 mAh g–1 after the 80th cycle). This superior property for Li+ storage is attributed to the ultrathin nanosheet structure, which
gives a large specific surface area and shortens the transport pathway
of lithium ions. This work provides a facile and effective route for
the preparation of ultrathin metal oxide NSAs for LIBs, which can
be extended to other applications in energy storage and conversion
systems.

Experimental Section
Reagents and Materials
All chemicals
purchased were
used without further purification. Co(NO3)2·6H2O and KOH were purchased from Aldrich Ltd. (Shanghai, China).
Dehydrated ethanol, acetone, and HCl were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Corp. The deionized water used in all experiments was purified through
a Millipore system.

Synthesis of CoIICoIII–LDH NSA
Precursor
The CoIICoIII–LDH
NSAs were synthesized by a fast electrosynthesis method. First, a
nickel foam (diameter: 1.5 cm) substrate was pretreated with acetone,
3 M HCl solution, deionized water, and ethanol, which was used as
the working electrode and placed in an electrochemical cell in a three-electrode
configuration (Pt wire as the counter electrode and saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode). The dissolved Co(NO3)2·6H2O in 50 mL of deionized water
was used as electrolyte. The CoIICoIII–LDH
NSAs grown on the surface of Ni foam were then prepared by a potentiostatic
deposition process at a potential of −1.0 V versus SCE. Different
thicknesses of CoIICoIII–LDH were obtained
by changing the concentration of Co(NO3)2·6H2O to 0.15, 0.075, and 0.05 M (named CoIICoIII–LDH-T1, T2, and T3, respectively).

Preparation of Ultrathin Co3O4 NSAs
The ultrathin Co3O4 NSAs
were obtained by
calcining the as-synthesized CoIICoIII–LDH
NSAs in air atmosphere. The typical heating process was carried out
in a muffle furnace, heating from room temperature to 450 °C
at 5 °C min–1, and then maintained for 2 h.
Finally, the product (Co3O4 NSAs) was slowly
cooled down to room temperature. The mass loading for all of the ultrathin
Co3O4 NSAs is about 1.0 mg cm–2 by controlling the electrosynthesis time.

Structural Characterizations
X-ray diffraction patterns
of the CoIICoIII–LDH and Co3O4 NSAs were collected on a Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer
using a Cu Kα source, with a scan range between 3 and 70°
at a scanning speed of 10 °C min–1. FT-IR spectra
were recorded on a NICOLET NEXUS470 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB
250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer at a pressure of about 2 ×
10–9 Pa using Al Kα X-rays as the excitation
source. The binding energies obtained in the XPS analysis were calibrated
for specimen charging by referencing the C 1s peak to 284.80 eV. The
morphologies of CoIICoIII–LDH and Co3O4 were investigated using a scanning electron
microscope (SEM; Zeiss SUPRA 55) with an accelerating voltage of 20
kV, combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for the
determination of metal composition. Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were recorded with Philips Tecnai 20 and JEOL JEM-2010
high-resolution transmission electron microscopes. The accelerating
voltage was 200 kV in each case. The thickness of Co3O4 was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Multimode
Nanoscope IIIa, Veeco Instruments) in tapping mode.

Electrochemical
Test
The obtained materials were first
cut into disc shapes (15 mm in diameter) by a slicer. Then, the electrodes
were tableted into thin sections (pressure control of 5–10
MPa). The cointype (2025) cells were assembled in an argon-filled
glovebox using pure lithium as the counter electrode, 1 M LiPF6 (ethylene carbonate/dimethylcarbonate 1:1 in volume) as the
electrolyte, and a microporous membrane (Celguard 2400) as the separator.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical surface area (ECSA), and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on a
CHI660E electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co,
China). The cells were galvanostatically charged and discharged between
0.005 and 3.0 V versus Li+/Li on a LAND test system at
room temperature. The double-layer capacitance (Cdl) of Co3O4-T1, -T2, -T3 was calculated on the basis of the CV curves
in 1.0 M KOH, which was measured in a non-faradaic region of 0.15–0.25
V at various scan rates. Charging current density differences (ΔJ = Ja – Jc) measured at 0.2 V were plotted against scan rate (Ja and Jc are the
anodic and cathodic current densities, respectively, and the linear
slope is twice that of Cdl).
