An
efficient, cost-effective, and earth-abundant catalyst that
could drive the production of hydrogen from water without or with
little external energy is the ultimate goal toward hydrogen economy.
Herein, nanoplates of tungsten oxide and its hydrates (WO3·H2O) as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) are reported. The square-shaped and stacked
WO3·H2O nanoplates are synthesized at room
temperature under air in ethanol only, making it as a promising green
synthesis strategy. The repeated electrochemical cyclic voltammetry
cycles modified the surface of WO3·H2O
nanoplates to WO3 as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron and
Auger spectroscopy, which leads to an improved HER activity. Hydrogen
evolution is further achieved from distilled water (pH 5.67) producing
1 mA cm–2 at an overpotential of 15 mV versus the
reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates demonstrate excellent durability
in acidic and neutral media, which is highly desirable for practical
application. Improved hydrogen evolution by WO3(200) when
compared to that by Pt(111) is further substantiated by the density
functional theory calculations.

Introduction
Rapid depletion of
fossil fuels and ever-increasing energy demand
prompt the researchers to explore clean, renewable, sustainable, and
environmentally friendly energy sources.1 On that prospect, hydrogen is considered as an efficient, earth-abundant,
and renewable clean energy carrier that has potential to play a major
role. Hydrogen can be produced through electrochemical water splitting
with zero emission of CO2, which makes the process green
and sustainable.2 Two important half reactions
of water splitting are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), that
is, 2H+(aq) + 2e– → H2(g) and the oxygen evolution reaction, that is, 2H2O(l)
→ O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e–, occurring at the cathode and the anode, respectively.3 To lower the overpotential of these reactions
while increasing their reaction rate, electrocatalysts at the cathode
and anode surface play the central role, thus improving the overall
efficiency of the water-splitting reaction. Noble metals such as platinum
(Pt), palladium (Pd), and ruthenium (Ru) have so far been recognized
as effective and efficient HER catalysts with negligible overpotential
and excellent kinetics in acidic electrolyte solutions.4,5 However, high cost and poor earth-abundance of these noble metals
are the major hindrance for their practical utilization.6,7 Therefore, it is indispensable to develop noble metal-free HER catalysts
which are not only efficient but also earth-abundant, low cost, and
stable in the electrolyte which is being used. Several noble metal-free
electrocatalysts, particularly Mo- and W-based materials, have been
reported recently and have been reckoned to be promising. In particular,
chalcogenides such as MoS2,8−12 WS2,13−16 WSe2,17 and MoSe217 have
been successfully investigated as cost-effective potential substitution
to the noble metal-based catalysts in acidic solutions. Although several
chalcogenides have been studied for the HER in acidic media, little
emphasis has been directed toward metal hydroxides and/or oxides and/or
in neutral media.

Hydrogen evolution in neutral electrolyte
solutions is desirable
for practical applications. Thus, 0.1 M acetate buffer solution (pH
4.5) and phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7) have been used as electrolytes
for hydrogen evolution by Andreiadis et al.18 with a cobalt-based complex and Karunadasa et al.19 with a molybdenum-oxo-complex, respectively. Helm et al.
also demonstrated hydrogen production using nickel complexes in both
aqueous and acidic electrolytes.20 The
synthesis of these metal complexes is not only complex but also involves
multiple steps and several chemicals. However, the stability of these
complexes for long-term uses is an issue. Therefore, it is of immense
importance to explore suitable inorganic electrocatalysts for hydrogen
generation in neutral media.

Here, competent HER activity of
tungsten trioxide (WO3) nanoplates is demonstrated in acidic
and neutral electrolytes,
and compared with standard platinum on carbon (Pt/C) catalysts. Coincidently,
WO3 was obtained by electrochemical surface oxidization
of WO3·H2O nanoplates through repeated
electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles for the first time.
The electrochemically surface-modified WO3·H2O exhibits a performance similar to WO3 obtained separately
by annealing WO3·H2O nanoplates under air
at 400 °C. It is noteworthy that WO3·H2O nanoplates were synthesized at room temperature using only ethanol
as a solvent thus excluding the use of corrosive HCl or HNO3 along with other organic chemicals previously reported for the synthesis
of hydrated WO3.21−24 To demonstrate the potential of the present electrocatalysts,
we further demonstrate hydrogen evolution in a neutral medium (distilled
water; pH, 5.67) and their remarkable stabilities in acidic and neutral
electrolytes. The superior HER activity of WO3 when compared
to that of Pt is additionally supported by reaction energetics obtained
by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Results and Discussion
Structural
Analysis
The structural analysis of the
as-synthesized samples was carried out by powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) as shown in Figure 1. The diffraction features of the precipitate formed at room
temperature (Figure 1a) are readily indexed to the orthorhombic WO3·H2O with lattice parameters a = 5.25 Å, b = 10.7 Å, and c = 5.11 Å, which
are in good agreement with those of JCPDS file no. 00-043-0679 (a = 5.24 Å, b = 10.7 Å, and c = 5.12 Å). The XRD pattern (Figure 1b) of WO3·H2O
annealed at 400 °C for 2 h under air matches that of monoclinic
WO3 with lattice parameters a = 7.3 Å, b = 7.51 Å, and c = 7.71 Å (JCPDS
file no. 01-083-0951, a = 7.3 Å, b = 7.54 Å, and c = 7.69 Å). No other phases
and/or impurities such as WO3·2H2O and
WO3·0.33H2O were found in any of these
samples indicating the phase-pure product. The XRD analysis suggests
that the WO3·H2O powder formed at room
temperature is completely phase-transformed to WO3 upon
annealing at 400 °C for 2 h under air.

WO3·H2O nanoplates and (b) monoclinic WO3 nanoplates obtained
by annealing WO3·H2O at 400 °C for
2 h under air.

Thermal Stability
Complete conversion of WO3·H2O to WO3 upon annealing was further
confirmed by thermogravimetry (TG) analysis. Figure 2 shows the TG and its derivative plot of
WO3·H2O nanoplates in a temperature range
of 26–800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under air. A major weight loss of 7.2% occurred up to 230 °C
matches the theoretical value of 7.2% confirming the phase transformation
of WO3·H2O to WO3.25 The subsequent weight loss of 1.1% between 230
and 400 °C is believed to be due to the final water decomposition
in the crystallization of minor amorphous contents.23 The TG analysis corroborates the XRD results on the complete
phase transformation of WO3·H2O to WO3 under air at 400 °C for 2 h (Figure 1).

Morphology and Microstructure
The morphology and microstructure
of the as-synthesized orthorhombic WO3·H2O and monoclinic WO3 were examined in detail using field
emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), respectively. Figure 3a,b shows the FESEM images of WO3·H2O nanoplates at different magnifications synthesized by mixing
WCl6 in ethanol at room temperature. These nanoplates were
found to be square-shaped, highly uniform, and stacked. The length/width
of these nanoplates was measured to be 100 nm with a thickness <30
nm, measured from the magnified SEM image (shown as an inset in Figure 3b). Figure 3c presents a TEM image of stacked
WO3·H2O nanoplates in accordance with the
FESEM images. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of a WO3·H2O nanoplate shows a lattice spacing of 3.5 Å
corresponding to the (111) plane as shown in Figure 3d. Additional TEM images (Figure S1, Supporting Information) clearly depict the stacked
arrangement and thickness of individual WO3·H2O nanoplates. The powder XRD pattern (Figure 1a) of WO3·H2O
nanoplates also shows maximum intensity for the same (111) plane indicating
their growth direction. The regular spot selected area diffraction
(SAED) pattern (inset of Figure 3d) obtained from the WO3·H2O nanoplate confirms its single crystalline nature. Although synthesis
of WO3·H2O nanoplates has been reported
earlier,21,23,24 they were
of much larger sizes and synthesized at a higher temperature than
the room temperature used in the present work. In particular, Huang
et al.23 synthesized rectangular slab-like
WO3·H2O of size 2–3 μm by
taking Na2WO4 and HCl at 70 °C for 10 h
and Kalantar-zadeh et al.24 reported hydrated
WO3 platelets of 0.2–2 μm size obtained at
80 °C for 6 h using 0.5 M HNO3. Recently, Guo et al.
reported orthorhombic WO3·H2O nanoplates
of size >200 nm by the hydrothermal method at 100 °C for 10
h.21 The formation of nanosized WO3·H2O plates (∼100 nm) is thus attributed
to the lower
synthesis temperature (room temperature) employed in the present work. Figure 3e,f shows the FESEM
images of stacked WO3 nanoplates at different magnifications
obtained by annealing WO3·H2O nanoplates
at 400 °C for 2 h under air. The annealing not only produced
phase-pure WO3 but also resulted in nanoplates to be separated
in the stack as shown in Figure 3f. A TEM image of WO3 nanoplates is shown
in Figure 3g, which
reveals the formation of gap between consecutive nanoplates (marked
by arrows) and voids (marked by a circle) in the nanoplates. The formation
of gaps and voids in WO3 nanoplates is due to the annealing
of WO3·H2O nanoplates at a higher temperature
(400 °C). In WO3·H2O, water molecules
are present between layers of WO6 octahedral units and the W–OH2 bond is weak.26,27 Thus, water molecules in WO3·H2O nanoplates are evaporated upon annealing
as confirmed from the mass loss (Figure 2) forming gaps between nanoplates and voids
in the resulting WO3 nanoplates. The HRTEM image of a WO3 nanoplate shows a lattice spacing of 3.8 Å, corresponding
to the (002) plane of monoclinic WO3. The regular spot
SAED pattern (inset of Figure 3h) confirmed the single crystalline nature of the WO3 nanoplates. In addition, the elemental energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
mapping of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates
was performed (Figure S2, Supporting Information) in a FESEM which shows a uniform distribution of W and O throughout
the sample.

Electrocatalytic HER Study
The electrochemical HER
performance of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates was examined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), CV, and
chronoamperometry in a highly acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) electrolyte. Figure 4a presents the LSV plots for the HER in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 1 mV s–1 with WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates along with Pt/C and glassy
carbon electrodes (GCE) for comparison. An overpotential of 147, 73,
and 24 mV was measured to obtain 10 mA cm–2 with
WO3·H2O, WO3, and Pt/C, respectively.
An 73 mV overpotential with WO3 nanoplates was found to
be smaller than that reported for several nonnoble metal electrocatalysts
including Ni2P (117 mV),28 MoS2/Au (226 mV),29 MoS2 (190 mV),30 WS2 (233 mV),13 and other electrocatalysts (Table S1, Supporting Information). Moreover, a similar
superior HER activity was reported by Phuruangrat et al. with hexagonal
WO3 nanowires synthesized by the microwave-assisted hydrothermal
method.31 This suggests WO3 as
a potential HER electrocatalyst. The cyclic stability of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates was tested by
performing CV for 4000 cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 at 100 mV s–1 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). A slight positive current on Pt/C,
WO3·H2O, and WO3 prior to onset
potential of the HER (Figure 4a) was found to disappear after CV cycles, which is believed
to be due to oxidative surface cleaning and surface oxidation of hydroxide.
Furthermore, the HER current density of WO3·H2O was found to be significantly increased (Figure S3a) with repeated CV cycles toward the value of WO3 nanoplates (Figure S3b), which
is attributed to surface oxidation of WO3·H2O to WO3 (discussed later). A smaller increase in the
HER current density for WO3 nanoplates (Figure S3b) can be termed to surface cleaning during CV cycles
and conversion of surface hydroxide to oxide.17Figure 4b shows the
Tafel plots of the electrocatalysts from which a slope was measured.
The Tafel slopes (and exchange current densities) were measured to
be 43.9 mV dec–1 (6.1 mA cm–2),
39.5 mV dec–1 (12.58 mA cm–2),
and 29 mV dec–1 (17.78 mA cm–2) for WO3·H2O, WO3, and Pt/C,
respectively, in the first cycle. The Tafel slope and exchange current
density were, respectively, smaller and larger with WO3 nanoplates than those of several other chalcogenides reported recently
(Table S1, Supporting Information) for
the HER. After 4000 CV cycles, the Tafel slope was found to be further
decreased while the exchange current density increased for WO3·H2O (Table 1). The estimated Tafel slopes suggested the Volmer–Tafel
HER mechanism of these electrocatalysts.32 The superior HER activity of W-based hydroxide and oxide to that
of other recently studied materials (Table S1, Supporting Information) makes it a potential candidate for
hydrogen generation.

To understand the better HER performance of
WO3 than
that of WO3·H2O, the electrochemical active
surface area (ECSA) was calculated from the electrochemical double
layer capacitance measurement using eq 1.33,34 1  where Cdl is the
electrochemical double layer capacitance and Cs refers the specific electrochemical double layer capacitance
of an atomically smooth surface (typically 15–50 μF cm–2).34 In the present case,
the value of Cs is 30 μF cm–2 for all the electrodes in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Cdl was calculated
by measuring the CVs at different scan rates in the nonfaradaic region. Figure 5a,b shows the CVs
of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates
at different scan rates (10–100 mV s–1) in
0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, respectively. The capacitive
currents for WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates at 0.7 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
were plotted as a function of scan rates (Figure 5c) and their slope is known as Cdl. The ECSA (and Cdl) of
WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates was
measured to be 1.0 cm2 (0.03 mF) and 2.83 cm2 (0.085 mF), respectively. The larger ECSA of WO3 nanoplates
clearly indicates more active sites in them, which resulted in higher
HER performance compared to that of WO3·H2O nanoplates. Furthermore, the specific activity (SA) of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates was calculated
to compare their intrinsic catalytic performance by normalizing the
HER current density to the specific surface area (Figure S4, Supporting Information) as per eq 2.35,36 2  where SA stands for specific
activity (mA
cm–2), j refers to the current
density (mA cm–2) at 0.35 V (vs RHE), m stands for the catalyst loading mass (28.57 mg cm–2), and SBET is the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
surface area (m2 g–1). The SA values
normalized to the specific surface area were calculated to be 2.58
and 5.38 in magnitude for WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates, respectively. This further confirms the higher
HER performance of WO3 nanoplates. The electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study was carried out to understand the
charge transfer behavior at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Figure 5d shows the Nyquist
plots of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates
before and after 4000 CV cycles at an applied potential of 0.06 V
versus the RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4. All the EIS spectra
show semicircles and straight lines in the high-frequency and low-frequency
regions, respectively. The diameter of the semicircles infers to the
charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the
electrode–electrolyte interface. A smaller semicircle confirms
superiority of the electrode because of a smaller Rct. The Rct values for WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates were measured
to be 9.3 and 5.5 Ω, respectively, by fitting the experimental
data with an equivalent circuit model shown as an inset in Figure 5d. As expected, the Rct value was decreased to 4.6 and 4.8 Ω
for WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates,
respectively, after 4000 cycle CV test. A smaller Rct further validates an increased current density with
the electrocatalysts after the stability test.

the equivalent circuit diagram used to fit the experimental data.

The quantitative estimation of
hydrogen evolution was finally performed
with WO3 nanoplates using a gas chromatograph. The hydrogen
generation rate was found to increase and reach 20.4 mmol·cm–2 in 10 h (Figure 6) with WO3 nanoplates at −0.76 V
versus the RHE in 0.5 M H2SO4. The repeated
4000 CV cycles (Figure S3, Supporting Information) and hydrogen generation for 10 h suggests the good stability of
WO3·H2O and WO3 for the HER.

Figure 6 H2 evolution measured by a gas chromatograph at −0.76
V vs the RHE using WO3 nanoplates as the electrocatalyst
and 0.5 M H2SO4 as the electrolyte.

The HER investigation was further extended to a
neutral medium
using normal distilled water (pH 5.67). Figure 7a–c shows the LSV, Tafel, and chronoamperometry
plots of WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates
in water. The HER was found to begin at ∼0.5 V versus the RHE
[−0.076 V vs saturated calomel electrode (SCE)] during the
cathodic scan and HER current sharply increased below 0 V versus the
RHE (−0.576 V vs SCE) in the presence of the catalyst, as shown
in Figure 7a. As expected,
WO3 exhibited a higher HER activity in the neutral medium
as well. The obtained HER current of 1.0 mA cm–2 at the overpotential of 15 mV in the first cycle is significantly
lower than recently reported electrocatalysts studied in the PBS electrolyte.18,37 The Tafel slopes (and exchange current densities) of 49.75 mV dec–1 (1.0 mA cm–2) and 43.43 mV dec–1 (1.15 mA cm–2) were measured for
WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates in
the first cycle, respectively. The repeated CV cycles showed an increase
in the HER current density of WO3·H2O to
the value obtained for WO3 nanoplates in water as well
(Figure S5a,b, Supporting Information).
After 10 000 CV cycles, LSV collected with WO3·H2O and WO3 nanoplates revealed improved performance,
that is, a higher current density (3.6 mA cm–2 at
15 mV overpotential for both WO3·H2O and
WO3 nanoplates), smaller Tafel slope (30.0 mV dec–1 for WO3·H2O and 41.98 mV dec–1 for WO3), and higher exchange current density (1.5 mA
cm–2 for WO3·H2O and
1.1 mA cm–2 for WO3) as shown in Figure
S6 (Supporting Information) and Table 1. Similar to the HER
study in acidic electrolyte, a higher positive current was found with
WO3·H2O than with WO3 nanoplates
prior to the onset of HER (Figure 7a), which is due to the oxidation of surface hydroxide.
However, after repeated CV cycles, the positive current prior to the
onset of the HER remained (Figure S6, Supporting Information), which suggests that further study is needed to
understand this behavior. The chronoamperometry measurement further
confirmed excellent stability of the electrocatalysts as studied for
20 h without a decrease in current (Figure 7c). The quantitative hydrogen generation
was also measured using gas chromatography and was found to be 550
μmol·cm–2 in 10 h with WO3 nanoplates at −0.42 V versus the RHE (or −1.0 V vs
SCE) in distilled water (Figure 7d).

Surface Composition
Improvements in the HER performance
of WO3·H2O after repeated CV cycles is
attributed to its surface modification to WO3. The change
in the surface composition was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic
(XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopic (AES) measurements. Figure 8 shows the W 4f and
O 1s region XPS spectra of WO3·H2O, WO3·H2O after repeated CV cycles (in 0.5 M H2SO4), and WO3. The W 4f binding energy
positions are well-matched to the literature values.38,39 The two O 1s XPS peaks at ∼530.5 and ∼531.7 eV are
assigned to oxide and surface hydroxide, respectively.39 The W and O atomic compositions estimated using
CasaXPS software are presented in Table 2, which clearly indicate the change in the
surface composition of WO3·H2O to WO3 after CV cycles. Figure S7 (Supporting Information) shows the AES spectra of WO3·H2O, WO3·H2O after CV cycles (in
0.5 M H2SO4), and WO3. The surface
composition (Table 2) measured by AES correlates the XPS results and confirmed the surface
oxidation of WO3·H2O to WO3 during
electrochemical CV cycles. This signifies the important role of room
temperature synthesized WO3·H2O nanoplates
for the HER. However, the XRD pattern (not shown) of WO3·H2O after CV cycles showed no change in its phase,
thus indicating the surface modification only.

DFT Study
The
mechanism of hydrogen evolution was further
investigated using periodic plane wave DFT calculations on the (200)
plane of the P21/n monocline
phase of WO3 nanoplates as per experimental observation
and their thermodynamic stability40 and
compared with those of the well-established Pt(111) catalyst.41 The protons adsorbed on the hcp site of Pt(111)
with the Pt–H bond distance of 1.912, 1.886, and 1.872 Å
whereas 0.98 Å atop WO3(200). The reaction coordinates
for proton adsorption followed by its recombination (H + e– → H* → 1/2H2) have been reported to be
the indicator of HER catalyst activity.42 Therefore, energy landscapes indicating the above reactions were
developed as shown in Figure 9. The adsorption energy of proton on Pt(111) was calculated
to be −2.52 eV matching the values calculated by Nobuhara et
al.43 Moreover, the proton adsorption energy
on WO3(200) was found to be −1.8 eV, which was lower
than that of Pt, establishing the reason behind the superior HER performance
of WO3 as experimentally observed.

Conclusions
The
present work spotlights the importance of hydroxide and oxide
for the water-splitting reaction and generation of hydrogen. The inherent
stability of oxides makes them highly suitable and efficient materials
for the water-splitting reaction. The superior HER performance of
WO3·H2O and WO3 was affirmed
through high hydrogen evolution current densities and smaller Tafel
slopes as demonstrated here. These catalysts also exhibited excellent
durability in acidic and neutral electrolytes. The synthesis of WO3·H2O at room temperature and its surface evolution
to WO3 during repeated electrochemical CV cycles were evidenced
from surface characterization and electrochemical performances. In
addition, the high hydrogen generation rate in acidic (20.4 mmol·cm–2) and neutral (550 μmol·cm–2) electrolytes as measured quantitatively demonstrated potential
of these electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation through water splitting.

In a typical synthesis, 40 mL (25 mM) of WCl6 was prepared
in ethanol and kept under ambient temperature
(at ∼30 °C) for 1 h to obtain pine green color precipitate
of WO3·H2O nanoplates, which was washed
with ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 4 h. WO3 nanoplates
were obtained by annealing WO3·H2O nanoplates
at 400 °C in a muffle furnace for 2 h under air and cooling the
furnace naturally to room temperature.

Characterization
The crystal structures of the samples
were examined with a PANalytical high-resolution XRD (PW 3040/60)
operated at 40 kV and 30 mA with Cu Kα X-rays (1.54 Å).
TG analysis was performed with a TA Instrument (TGA Q50) under synthetic air (N2/O2 = 80:20) at a
heating rate of 10 °C per min. The surface morphology of the
as-synthesized WO3·H2O and WO3 powder was examined using a Carl Zeiss SUPRA 40 FESEM. The detailed
microstructures of the samples were analyzed using a Tecnai G2 TEM (FEI) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The surface
analysis of the samples was carried out by XPS using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe
II scanning XPS microprobe with a monochromatic Al Kα source
(1486.6 eV). The AES measurements were performed with a scanning Auger
nanoprobe (PHI 710, ULAC-PHI Inc.) equipped with a coaxial cylindrical
mirror analyzer.

Electrochemical Study
The HER activity
of the as-synthesized
catalysts was studied using a BioLogic SP-150 potentiostat with Pt-foil
as the counter electrode, SCE as the reference electrode, and a GCE
coated with the catalyst as the working electrode. Prior to loading
the catalyst, the GCE was cleaned by polishing with alumina powder
and sonicating in distilled water and ethanol. A slurry was prepared
by sonicating the catalyst powder (WO3·H2O or WO3 nanoplates) in a mixture of distilled water (10
mg mL–1) and one drop of diluted polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) (10 μL of 1% PTFE dispersion) for 30 min. Then, 50 μL
of slurry was coated on the GCE by drop-cast and dried under vacuum
overnight. The electrochemical measurements such as LSV and CV were
carried out with a three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte at a scan rate of 1–100 mV s–1. The HER study was also performed in a neutral electrolyte using
distilled water (pH 5.67). The electrode potential was calibrated
with respect to the RHE by using the equation, E(RHE)
= E(SCE) + 0.241 + 0.0591 pH. Stabilities of the
as-synthesized electrocatalysts were measured by chronoamperometry
for 20 h at a selected applied potential. The hydrogen generation
rate was measured using a gas chromatograph (7890B, Agilent Technologies)
both in acidic (0.5 M H2SO4) and neutral electrolytes
(distilled water, pH 5.67) at −0.36 V and −0.42 V versus
the RHE, respectively.

DFT Calculations
The HER mechanism
was analyzed using
DFT calculations on the (200) plane of P21/n monoclinic WO3 following the experimental
observation. DFT calculations were implemented with a Quantum ESPRESSO
package.44 For optimization, a 2 ×
2 surface unit cell was used with three layers while freezing bottom
two layers. To avoid the interaction of the adsorbate and periodic
image of the slab, a vacuum of 10 Å was incorporated. Plane wave
self-consistent field calculations were carried out with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
exchange–correlation functional,42 and ultrasoft pseudopotentials were used. For the wave functions
(and charge densities), a kinetic energy cutoff of 37 Ry (370 Ry)
was used. The convergence threshold of 1 × 10–6 arb units and 2 × 2 × 1 k-mesh were used
for energy and Brillouin zone sampling, respectively. DFT analysis
was also done with a stable (111) plane of Pt within a Pt 2 ×
2 super cell. A comparative energy landscape for the reaction H+ + e– → H* was developed for the
synthesized catalyst and the established Pt catalyst to corroborate
the difference in their activities.
