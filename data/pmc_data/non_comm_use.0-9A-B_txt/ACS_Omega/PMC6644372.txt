Four
derivatives of dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (DTmBDT) have
been synthesized to investigate the correlation between molecular
structure, thin-film organization, and charge-carrier transport. Phenyl
or thiophene end-capped derivatives at alpha positions of the outer
thiophenes of DTmBDT present vastly
different optoelectronic properties in comparison with bay-position
alkyl-chain-substituted DTmBDT, which
was additionally confirmed by density functional theory simulations.
The film morphology of the derivatives strongly depends on alkyl substituents,
aromatic end-caps, and substrate temperature. Field-effect transistors
based on DTmBDT derivatives with bay-substituted
alkyl chains show the best performance within this studied series
with a hole mobility up to 0.75 cm2/V s. Attachment of
aromatic end-caps disturbs the ordering, limiting the charge-carrier
transport. Higher substrate temperature during deposition of the DTmBDT derivatives with aromatic end-caps
results in larger domains and improved the transistor mobilities but
not beyond the alkylated DTmBDT.

1 Introduction
Acenes
and heteroacenes have been studied intensively over the
recent years for their unique optoelectronic and semiconducting properties,1 which are used in electronic applications such
as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting
diodes, organic photovoltaics, and nonlinear optics.2−4 A remarkable progress in the development of highly stable and solution-processable
acenes has been made by introducing heteroatoms into the acene core
and solubilizing groups on the acene backbone, respectively.5−7 However, new acene core structures require thorough understanding
of the molecular alignment with respect to substituted or functionalized
pristine core to achieve a promising device performance.8−10 Therefore, the systematic investigation of novel and potential molecular
model compounds that show robust performance under simple processing
techniques still remains an important task.

Among the class
of heteroacenes, bridged thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT)
units have attracted considerable interest.11−18 Bridging the bithieno[3,2-b]thiophene drives the
two units into coplanarity, giving rise to good electron density delocalization,
and reduces reorganization energy.19 The
bridging moieties are also known to have a substantial impact on the
solubility, molecular packing, and optoelectronic as well as thermal
properties.20−25 We have developed heteroatom-containing pentacene analog molecules,
namely, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]bis[b]benzothiophene (BBBT),26 dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT),19,27 and very recently, 5,10-didodecyl-dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (DTmBDT).28,29 We demonstrated the
potential of the later novel building block (DTmBDT) by alternating copolymerization with an acceptor unit,
specifically, 2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-di(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP) to obtain a high-performance p-type
polymer semiconductor.28 The current versatile
building block DTmBDT can be easily
turned soluble by attaching suitable substituents at the bay positions
or can be functionalized in the alpha positions of the outer thiophenes.
Here, we have synthesized four DTmBDT core-based derivatives with either alkyl chains at bay positions
or aromatic moieties as end-caps at alpha positions of the outer thiophenes
namely, DTmBDT-C3, DTmBDT-C12, TH-DTmBDT-C12, and PH-DTmBDT-C12 (Figures 1 and S1). The
electrochemical, thermal, film morphologies, and charge-transport
properties of these four compounds have been systematically investigated
and discussed in terms of structure–property relations. It
is observed that the aromatic end-caps disturb the morphology formation
in vacuum-sublimated films of TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12, limiting the charge-carrier
transport in transistors. However, a higher substrate temperature
of these two compound results in large domains with improved transistor
performance.

2 Results and Discussion
Compound 3,3′-dibromo-2,2′-bithieno[3,2-b]thiene-5,5′-diyl)bis(trimethylsilane) (1)28 was coupled with 1,2-dodecyl or propyl
ethenyl
diboronic ester (2a,b) via Suzuki–Miyaura reaction (Scheme 1), followed by the
removal of trimethylsilane moieties by excess addition of K2CO3 to the reaction mixture to yield respective products,
5,10-didodecyl-substituted DTmBDT-C12 and 5,10-dipropyl DTmBDT-C3. This
one-pot synthesis is convenient with high yields of the desired products,
70% for DTmBDT-C12 and 77% for DTmBDT-C3. The 3,8-bisphenyl-5,10-didodecyl-dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (PH-DTmBDT-C12) and 3,8-bisthiophene-5,10-didodecyl-dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (TH-DTmBDT-C12) were synthesized via Migita–Kosugi–Stille
coupling reactions between 3,8-dibromo-5,10-didodecyl-dithieno[2,3-d;2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (Br2-DTmBDT) and
corresponding tributyl(aryl)stannane reagents, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Alkylated
and End-Capped DTmBDT Derivatives
The crystallization of DTmBDT-C3 in
tetrahydrofuran (THF) via slow diffusion of methanol led to colorless
rod-shaped single crystals. However, attempts to obtain single crystals
of DTmBDT-C12, PH-DTmBDT-C12, and TH-DTmBDT-C12 were
not successful. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of DTmBDT-C3 revealed a packing in a P21/c (monoclinic) space group
with a complete planar structure (Figure 2). Unlike Br2-DTmBDT, DTmBDT-C3 did not form dyads between two molecular planes in
a face-to-face manner, but the edge overlapped with propyl chains
at the same side. The packing pattern of the molecules in single crystals
followed a “herringbone” arrangement with a π–π
distance of 3.69 Å (Supporting Information).

of overlapped (colored in green and red) adjacent molecules. (c) Herringbone
packing pattern.

The UV–vis absorption
and emission spectra in 10–5 M solutions of the DTmBDT derivatives
in DCM are depicted in Figure 3. The absorption spectra of DTmBDT-C12 and DTmBDT-C3 are identical with two
bands around 342 and 275 nm, which are arising from the π–π*
transition of conjugated backbone (see Supporting Information Figure S2). The phenyl and thiophene end-capped PH-DTmBDT-C12 and TH-DTmBDT-C12 showed red-shifted bands because of enhanced conjugation
lengths (Table 1).
The absorption maximum (λmax) of TH-DTmBDT-C12 was further red-shifted by 15 nm compared
to PH-DTmBDT-C12. Their emission spectra
showed a similar trend as the absorption spectra with bathochromic-shifted
emission maximum (λem = 436 nm) for TH-DTmBDT-C12 compared to PH-DTmBDT-C12 (420 nm) and DTmBDT-C12 (357 nm). Besides the maxima of emission peaks, clearly resolved
shoulder peaks were observed because of vibronic coupling of the nearly
planar structures (Figure 3b).

Electrochemical properties of the DTmBDT molecules were investigated in a 0.1 M DCM solution using Bu4NPF6 as the electrolyte. DTmBDT-C12, TH-DTmBDT-C12, and PH-DTmBDT-C12 showed clearly visible two
oxidation waves (Figure 4). The first oxidation of PH-DTmBDT-C12 occurred at 0.66 V and second oxidation at 0.8 V, whereas TH-DTmBDT-C12 showed first and second oxidations
at 0.25 and 0.51 V, respectively. In contrast, DTmBDT-C12 exhibited the first oxidation at 0.53 V. It should
be noted that DTmBDT-C3 and DTmBDT-C12 have same oxidation–reduction potentials
similar to their optical properties. It was clearly evident that the
substituents phenyl and thiophene have significantly influenced the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the DTmBDT-based compounds (Table 1). The lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) energy levels were calculated from optical band gap
(Eoptical) and HOMO energy levels.

a scan rate of 100 mV/s. The potentials reported vs the Fc+/Fc redox couple as an external standard.

The geometric and electronic structures of the DTmBDT derivatives were calculated using Gaussian 09
with density functional theory (DFT) and B3LYP/6-31G(d) as the basis
set. The optimized geometries of DTmBDT-C12, PH-DTmBDT-C12, and TH-DTmBDT-C12 were provided in Figure S1, and calculated dihedral angles (θdh) between
the DTmBDT core unit and end-capped moieties were listed
in Table 1. Phenyl-capped PH-DTmBDT-C12 showed a bigger θdh than the thiophene-substituted molecule. As expected, the
frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) were fully distributed
throughout the conjugated backbone of the three molecules. The calculated
values of the HOMO levels agreed with the experimental oxidation levels.
However, the energy gaps from time-dependent DFT calculation are much
larger than the optical gaps but that may be because of the neglect
of full configuration in the simulation method (Table 1 and Figure 5).

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out to
determine
thermal properties during heating of DTmBDT-C12, PH-DTmBDT-C12, and TH-DTmBDT-C12. Information about these thermal transitions
is necessary for the selection of the substrate temperature, which
has a significant impact on the microstructure and surface morphology
of organic semiconductors.30,31 During heating of DTmBDT-C12, a sharp endothermic peak appeared
at 105 °C (Figure 6), which was attributed to the melting of the compound. TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12 exhibited a more complex thermal behavior, with three and four endothermic
transitions, respectively, during heating. TH-DTmBDT-C12 revealed two strong, sharp endothermic peaks, at 65
and 125 °C, related to transitions between crystalline phases
and a smaller one at 144 °C because of the melting of the compound
into the isotropic phase. The exothermic peak at 84 °C was probably
caused by cold crystallization. The four endothermic peaks observed
for PH-DTmBDT-C12 appeared at 25, 125,
140, and 177 °C, suggesting the presence of three phase transitions,
and thus presence of different crystalline phases. The melting peak
was located at the highest temperature. All compounds showed good
thermal stabilities, and their decomposition temperature was about
390 °C for DTmBDT-C12 and about
430 °C for TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12 (Figure S3). On the basis of these results, the substrate temperatures
during sublimation were chosen. Apart from deposition of all compounds
at 25 °C, the sublimation of TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12 was performed onto
hot substrates with temperatures of 100 and 150 °C, respectively,
to investigate the character of different crystalline phases on the
film morphology.

Figure 6 DSC thermograms of the DTmBDT derivatives
recorded during second heating.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the
influence
of the alkyl chain length and the role of the thiophene and phenyl
end-capping units on the film morphologies of the sublimed compounds.
The compounds were deposited on silicone substrates equipped with
a bis(trimethylsilyl)amine (HMDS)-treated SiO2 dielectric.
The AFM images in Figure 7 showed differences in the film microstructure between DTmBDT-C3 and DTmBDT-C12. Compound DTmBDT-C3 revealed a film topography consisting of crystals immersed in a
featureless or amorphous fraction (Figure 7a). The crystals were distributed randomly
without any distinct surface orientation, leading to a high film roughness
of 2.9 nm. Compound DTmBDT-C12 exhibited
relatively flat islands with a slightly lower surface roughness of
1.46 nm, suggesting a gradual film growth (Figure 7b). The height profiles of the DTmBDT-C12 film disclosed a step-terrace structure
with step heights of 3.7–4.0 nm, which was characteristic for
a layer-plus-island Stranski–Krastanov (SK) growth.32 This was a similar initial growth pattern, as
reported for pentacene.33,34 In this growth model,
the molecules approaching the substrate are more bound to the substrate
than to each other. This condenses the first molecules as highly ordered
monolayer on the surface. On the initial layer, flat islands are then
formed with a height corresponding to the interplanar spacing of DTmBDT-C12 (Figure S4). During the SK growth, the flat islands grow laterally with the
additional material deposited to eventually merge into a continuous
layer, which can be partially observed in Figure 7b. The subsequent layers start to form before
the previous layer is complete. This is consistent with the aforementioned
SK growth mechanism.35 Summarizing the
morphology study, longer alkyl chains improved the film formation
process into homogenous and well-defined layers. Decrease of the domain
surface roughness is connected to the type of the grown structure
(crystal or island) and is induced by the longer dodecyl chains.

Figure 7 AFM height
images of (a) DTmBDT-C3 and (b) DTmBDT-C12 sublimed at 25
°C substrate temperature.

The AFM images of PH-DTmBDT-C12 and TH-DTmBDT-C12 showed sharp, fibrous
grains
of small-size and random orientation, with larger features for TH-DTmBDT-C12 (Figure 8a,c). Both surfaces were more familiar to
each other than to the DTmBDT-C12 morphology.
This suggested that the phenyl or thiophene end-caps significantly
altered the film formation from SK growth for DTmBDT-C12 to a less-defined structure of PH-DTmBDT-C12 and TH-DTmBDT-C12. An average grain size of 73 and 121 nm (detailed information about
the grain size can be found in Figure S5) was determined for PH-DTmBDT-C12 and TH-DTmBDT-C12, respectively. TH-DTmBDT-C12 created almost two times larger crystal
domains compared to PH-DTmBDT-C12 probably
because of the smaller dihedral angle (θ) of 20.5° of the
thiophene to the DTmBDT core, which
less disturbed the molecular interactions with respect to PH-DTmBDT-C12 with θ = 27.5°. Significant changes
in the surface morphology were found when the compounds were evaporated
onto substrates with temperatures of 150 °C for PH-DTmBDT-C12 and 100 °C for TH-DTmBDT-C12 close to their melting points. Both compounds exhibited
large elongated, interdigitated structures with reduced grain boundaries
(Figure 8b,d). The
average grain size dramatically increased to 9.9 and 2.2 μm
for PH-DTmBDT-C12 and TH-DTmBDT-C12, respectively, which was 2 and 3 orders
of magnitude larger than for films deposited at 25 °C. However,
the film deposited at a high substrate temperature displayed clear
deep cracks (Figure 8b,d). Height profiles of the AFM images for PH-DTmBDT-C12 revealed a crack depth of 46 nm through the entire
50 nm thick film.

substrate
temperatures. PH-DTmBDT-C12 deposited
onto (a) 25 and (b) 150 °C; TH-DTmBDT-C12 deposited onto (c) 25 and (d) 100 °C heated substrates.

To better understand the influence
of the alkyl substituents (C3
and C12) on the self-organization of the molecules, grazing incidence
wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed.
The patterns indicate a highly crystalline structure for both compounds
(Figure 9a,b). The
interlayer distance of 1.79 nm for DTmBDT-C3 was determined from the main out-of-plane 100 reflections observed
at qxy = 0.0 Å–1 and qz = 0.35 Å–1. Second- and third-order reflections
localized at qz = 0.69
Å–1 and qz = 1.05 Å–1 for qxy = 0.0 Å–1 implied
a long-range organization of the molecules in the out-of-plane direction
of the film. The increase of the interlayer distance from 1.79 nm
for DTmBDT-C3 to 3.75 nm for DTmBDT-C12 was caused by the longer linear substituents
implying no interdigitation of the side chains (Figure S6a). The interlayer distance of DTmBDT-C12 is in good agreement with the step height of the terrace
structure observed in the AFM image. Additionally, in both cases,
in-plane reflections at the same positions at qxy = 0.77 Å–1 and qz = 0 Å–1 (d spacing of 0.82 nm) were found implying identical
packing of the molecules in stacks with a herringbone structure and
an edge-on arrangement on the surface (Figure S6a). A π-stacking distance of 0.38 nm was derived for DTmBDT-C3 from off-equatorial reflections
located at qxy = 1.56
Å–1 and qz = 0.63 Å–1 corresponding to the value
found for the single crystal (0.37 nm). The high reflection intensity
and small π-stacking distance were characteristic for well-ordered
molecules within the layers. It was not possible to determine the
π-stacking distance for DTmBDT-C12 because the corresponding reflection was broader suggesting a lower
order because of the longer side chains. In contrast to the solely
alkyl-substituted DTmBDT derivatives,
the crystallinity of TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12 deposited at 25 °C was
poor as evident from the low intensity and small number of reflections
in the corresponding GIWAXS patterns (Figure S7). This corresponds well to the disordered film morphology displayed
in the AFM image in Figure 8a,c. Deposition of the compounds onto higher temperature substrate
significantly improved the molecular order (Figure 9c,d). Interestingly, the interlayer distance
for TH-DTmBDT-C12 decreased to 2.79
nm in comparison with 3.70 nm for DTmBDT-C12, as derived from the main interlayer reflection at qxy = 0 Å–1 and qz = 0.23 Å–1 (Figure 9c). This
decrease could originate from tilting of the molecules with respect
to the substrate (Figure S6b). The off-equatorial
position of the π-stacking reflection at qxy = 1.60 Å–1 and qz = 1.35 Å–1 verified a 40° tilting of the molecules with respect to the
out-of-plane direction. Assuming an interlayer distance of 3.70 nm
for nontilted molecules, the cosine trigonometric function provided
a theoretical interlayer distance of 2.83 nm for molecules tilted
by 40° being in good agreement with the experimental data (Figure S6b). These calculations imply that interdigitation
of the side chains did not occur also for TH-DTmBDT-C12. The long-range organization of TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12 deposited at high temperature confirmed the higher order out-of-plane
reflections. The in-plane reflection at qxy = 0.4 Å–1 and qz = 0 Å–1 was
assigned to a d spacing of 1.57 nm corresponding
between the stacks in which the molecules were packed in the herringbone
fashion (Figures S6b and S8). The increased
distance in comparison with DTmBDT-C12 is related to the two additional thiophene units terminating the DTmBDT core. Only small changes in organization
were observed for PH-DTmBDT-C12 with
respect to TH-DTmBDT-C12 (for PH-DTmBDT-C12, the interlayer and stack distances
are 2.75 and 1.60 nm, respectively).

The charge-carrier transport of the DTmBDT derivatives was investigated by field-effect transistors
(OFETs)
in bottom-gate bottom-contact (BGBC) configuration. The active layer
of the DTmBDT-based OFETs was fabricated
by thermal deposition on silicone substrates equipped with a HMDS-
treated SiO2 dielectric. All compounds showed typical p-type
behavior, as confirmed by the transfer and output characteristics.
From the transfer characteristics in Figure S9, charge-carrier mobilities of 0.25 cm2/V s for DTmBDT-C3 and 0.75 cm2/V s for DTmBDT-C12 with an on/off ratio exceeding
105 were derived (Table 2). These mobilities were in the same order of magnitude
as for dialkoxylated DTmBDT, as reported
in the literature.36 However, the threshold
voltage for DTmBDT-C3 and DTmBDT-C12 was lower in comparison with the literature
values and was not dependent on the film morphology of the compounds.

PH-DTmBDT-C12	150	0.17	0.15	106	–6	
In comparison with DTmBDT-C3 and DTmBDT-C12, a significant decrease
of the
charge-carrier mobility was observed to be 0.0007 cm2/V
s for TH-DTmBDT-C12 and 0.026 cm2/V s for PH-DTmBDT-C12 when both were deposited at 25 °C (Figures 10 and S10). This decline in performance is caused by
the molecular disorder, as confirmed by the low-intensity reflections
in the GIWAXS patterns. The transistor performance improved for TH-DTmBDT-C12 and PH-DTmBDT-C12 films deposited onto higher temperature substrates
because of changes in the morphology. Compound TH-DTmBDT-C12 sublimed onto 100 °C heated Si/SiO2 substrate exhibited a charge-carrier mobility of 0.06 cm2/V s with an unchanged on/off ratio of 106 (Figures 10 and S10). A larger increase in mobility to 0.17 cm2/V s and an on/off ratio of 108 was found for PH-DTmBDT-C12 after sublimation onto 150
°C substrate (Figures 10 and S10). At the same time, the
threshold voltage for PH-DTmBDT-C12 was
reduced by nearly half. This enhanced transistor performance of PH-DTmBDT-C12 and TH-DTmBDT-C12 is attributed to the significant increase in crystallinity
and molecular order as well as formation of large domains in films
obtained at higher temperatures, as evident in the AFM images (Figure 8b,d) and GIWAXS patterns
(Figure 9c,d).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have synthesized and studied the structure–property
relations of four DTmBDT derivatives.
Optoelectronic and electrochemical properties were significantly influenced
by nature of end-capped moieties of the DTmBDT core. The 5,10-dipropyl DTmBDT-C3 single crystals were packed in a herringbone structure, demonstrating
complete planarity of the core and complementing to the interdigitating
of long alkyl chain in case of Br2-DTmBDT. Thermogravimetric analysis
of these heteroacene derivatives exhibited high thermal stability
with decomposition temperatures above 390 °C. The morphology
of vacuum sublimated films was controlled by the substrate temperature
and chemical structure of the derivatives such as alkyl chain length
or aromatic end-caps. Because of the well-defined morphology, DTmBDT-C12 showed the highest charge-carrier
mobilities of 0.75 cm2/V s in field-effect transistors
within this series. Aromatic end-caps at the DTmBDT core disturbed the growth into a homogenous film morphology
that limited the charge-carrier transport. Large domains could be
obtained for these derivatives with a higher substrate temperature
leading to improved transistor mobilities. The dramatic increase of
mobility associated with the change of the substrate temperature underlines
the necessity of thermal investigation in case of novel organic semiconductors.

All reagents were
purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification
unless otherwise stated. Column chromatography was performed using
Merck silica gel 60, 40–63 μm (230–400 mesh).
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out using precoated aluminum
sheets with silica gel 60 F254 (Merck), visualization by UV light. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in the
listed deuterated solvents on a Bruker AVANCE 300 and 250 MHz spectrometer.
Mass spectra were obtained using field desorption on a VG Instruments
ZAB 2-SE-FPD spectrometer. Elemental analysis was carried out using
a Foss Heraeus Vario EL in the Institute of Organic Chemistry at the
Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz. The UV–vis spectra were
recorded at 298 K on a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 spectrophotometer. Cyclic
voltammetry measurements were carried out on a computer-controlled
GSTAT12 in a three-electrode cell in a DCM solution of Bu4NPF6 (0.1 M) with a scan rate of 100 mV/s at room temperature,
using Pt disc as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode,
and Ag electrode as the reference electrode. HOMO energy levels were
calculated from the onsets of the first oxidation peak by empirical
formulas EHOMO = −(Eox1onset +
4.8) eV, whereas the potentials were determined using ferrocene (Fc)
as a standard. DFT calculations were carried out at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level using Gaussian 09,37 and molecular
structures were generated using GaussView 5.0.9.38 The X-ray crystallographic data for the molecules were
collected on a SMART charge-coupled device diffractometer using a
Mo Kα graphite monochromator radiation source. Thermogravimetry
analysis (TGA) was carried out on a METTLER 500 thermogravimetry analyzer
with heating rates of 10 K/min. DSC were measured on a METTLER DSC
30 with heating and cooling rates of 10 K/min. AFM was performed with
ScanAsyst-Fluid+ probes in peak force nanomechanical mapping mode
with a Bruker FastScan instrument.

4.3 AFM Analysis
Veeco Dimension 3100
atomic force microscope was used to inspect the microstructure and
the thickness of the sublimated films. All images were obtained in
the tapping mode with Olympus silicone cantilevers at 320 kHz resonance
frequency. Grain-size analysis was performed by marking grains above
a specified threshold height in Gwyddion 2.47 software. Root-mean-square
roughness parameters were obtained using the same software package.

4.4 Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering
To investigate the molecular ordering in the sublimed films, GIWAXS
measurements were performed at the DELTA Synchrotron using beamline
BL09 with a photon energy of 10 keV (λ = 1.239 Å). The
beam size was 1.0 mm × 0.2 mm (width × height), and samples
were irradiated just below the critical angle for total reflection
with respect to the incoming X-ray beam (∼0.1°). The scattering
intensity was detected on a 2-D image plate (MAR-345) with a pixel
size of 150 μm (2300 × 2300 pixels), and the detector was
placed 381 mm from the sample center. The raw detector image needs
to be converted into a reciprocal space. This was carried out by using
a calibration standard (silver behenate), which has rings at known
2Θ positions. Scattering data are expressed as a function of
the scattering vector: q = 4π/λ sin(Θ),
where Θ is a half of the scattering angle and λ = 1.239
Å is the wavelength of the incident radiation. Here, qxy (qz) is a component of the scattering vector
in-plane (out-of-plane) to the sample surface. All X-ray scattering
measurements were performed under vacuum (∼1 mbar) to reduce
air scattering and beam damage to the sample. All GIWAXS data processing
and analysis were performed by using the software package Datasqueeze
(http://www.datasqueezesoftware.com).

4.5 Fabrication and Measurement of OFET Devices
OFET devices were fabricated in a BGBC configuration on Si/SiO2 substrates with 50 nm thick gold electrodes. The SiO2 dielectric layer was 300 nm thick with a dielectric constant
of 3.9. The source–drain electrodes were interdigitated with
channel length varying from 2.5 to 40 μm and channel width varying
from 0.1 to 1 mm. Substrates were cleaned softly with IPA and acetone,
making sure that the prefabricated electrodes are not damaged. Then,
HMDS treatment was performed on the substrates that were placed in
an oven with HMDS at a temperature of 120 °C for 5 h to form
a HMDS self-assembled monolayer. Before evaporation, the glass crucibles
were cleaned thoroughly in piranha solution (3:1 solution of sulfuric
acid and hydrogen peroxide) to remove all organic residues and then
washed with isopropyl alcohol and acetone. The organic semiconductor
layers were deposited by vacuum-evaporation at a rate of 0.6 Å/min
using Tectra mini-coater high-vacuum coating system. The film thickness
was about 40 nm controlled using quartz crystal microbalance monitor
and adjusted by AFM. Transistors were measured by using a Keithley
2634B source meter. Mobilities were calculated from the transfer characteristics
in the saturation regime, using the following formula  where Id is the
drain current, W is the channel width, L is the channel length, Ci is the capacitance
of gate dielectric, Vg is the gate voltage,
and Vth is the threshold voltage.

This formula was further modified to extract μsat with respect to the slope of a straight line fitted to the square
root of the transfer characteristic  where a is the slope of the
fitted straight line.

Threshold voltage is estimated as a cross-point
of the fitted line
and OX axis. The ON/OFF ratio is calculated as a division of Ids current in the highest Vds and Vgs voltages by Ids current for the same Vds and Vgs = 0 V.
