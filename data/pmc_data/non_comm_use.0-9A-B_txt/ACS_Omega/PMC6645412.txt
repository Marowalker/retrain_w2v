A liquid-like poly(ionic
liquid) (PIL) with a very low glass transition
temperature of −51 °C and a thermal decomposition temperature
of 202.7 °C was synthesized. A PIL-based electrolyte by mixing
this poly(ionic liquid) with additives of 10 wt % propylene carbonate
and 0.1 M LiClO4 is proved to be an excellent electrolyte
for lithium-ion battery. The obtained PIL-based electrolyte exhibits
a high ionic conductivity of 8.3 × 10–5 S cm–1 at 25 °C and 2.0 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 60 °C and a wide electrochemical
potential window up to 5.61 V at 25 °C and 4.14 V at 60 °C.
The Li/LiFePO4 batteries equipped with this PIL-based electrolyte
achieve high capacity, outstanding cycling stability and rate capability
at 25 °C, and even improved performance at high temperature like
60 °C. Such excellent performances of batteries are attributed
to the formation of stable solid-electrolyte interface film at the
lithium-electrolyte interface and the stability of electrolyte during
cycling.

1 Introduction
Lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) possess high specific capacities (for
example, 170 mAh g–1 with LiFePO4 (LFP)
as cathode1) and have been widely used
in today’s technological products such as smart phone, laptop
computer, electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles. Yet, safety
problems in LIBs, especially in the electrolyte, are still important
issues and further improvements are strongly desired. Traditionally,
ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate,
or their hybrid solvents are used as electrolytes because of the advantages
like low cost, high conductivity, and low melting point.2−6 However, such electrolytes associate at the same time with several
serious safety problems. For example, the low flashing point means
that the electrolyte can catch fire easily in case of local overheating
in the battery. The volatilization of the electrolyte in an airtight
cell might cause the battery to expand, resulting in the leakage of
electrolyte and hence the damage of the product.

Polymers have
excellent thermal stability and are nonvolatile.
Therefore, they are applied as electrolytes to improve the safety
of LIBs.7−9 The most commonly used polymers are poly(ethylene
oxide) (PEO) and PEO-based polymers because the PEO chain segments
are flexible and their −CH2CH2O–
repeat unit can provide good solubility and conductivity to Li+.10 However, PEO is not conductive
and usually solid-like at room temperature, resulting in the low ionic
conductivity of the electrolyte. Alternatively, room-temperature ionic
liquids are also extensively investigated as electrolytes for enhancing
the safety of LIBs because the ionic liquids have high ionic conductivity,
negligible volatility, and good thermal, chemical, and electrochemical
stabilities.11−13 Advantages of both polymers and ionic liquids can
be combined to give poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs), which can be designed
and synthesized for some specific applications as gas adsorption materials,
antimicrobial materials, catalytic materials, electrochemical energy
materials, and the likes.14,15 Wang et al.16 reported a PIL, poly(N-(1-vinylimidazolium-3-butyl)-ammonium
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide)-co-poly(poly(ethylene
glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PVIMTFSI-co-PPEGMA),
which can be used to fabricate all-solid electrolyte (PVIMTFSI-co-PPEGMA/LiTFSI) by mixing with lithium bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI). For the PVIMTFSI-co-PPEGMA/LiTFSI-based
LiFePO4/Li battery, the discharge-specific capacities of
136 and 70 mAh g–1 at current densities of 0.1 and
1C were achieved at 60 °C, respectively. The authors also demonstrated
that the polymeric ionic liquid segments can restrain the formation
of lithium dendrites.16 Lu et al.17 constructed a PIL-based electrolyte film based
on a lithium-containing zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) with
or without propylene carbonate (PC) by in situ photopolymerization.
The lithium-containing IL was synthesized by equimolecular neutralization
of 3-(1-vinyl-3-imidazolio)-propanesulfonate and LiTFSI. With 50–90
wt % PC, a comparable ionic conductivity of ∼10–3 S cm–1 was obtained for the PIL-based electrolyte
film at 30 °C. The Li/LiFePO4 half-cell equipped with
the PIL/30PC film (30 wt % PC) shows a good initial discharge-specific
capacity of 120.4 mAh g–1, and the corresponding
Coulombic efficiency is 89.1% at 0.1C. However, the discharge-specific
capacity of the Li/LiFePO4 half-cell decreases slowly with
cycling to reach 99.2 mAh g–1 in the 30th cycle,
indicating the existence of irreversible electrochemical reactions
of the electrode.17

However, most
reported PILs are solid-like at room temperature,
so their ionic conductivities are usually rather low at the temperature.
The reports of room-temperature liquid-like PILs are rare.18,19 The liquid-like PILs might have improve ionic conductivity. Snow
et al. reported the first example of liquid-like poly(ionic liquid),
which showed a low glass transition temperature (Tg) of −47 °C and an electrowetting effect.18 Yuan et al. reported the second example of liquid-like
poly(ionic liquid), which showed a low Tg of −57 °C and exhibited fluidic behavior in a wide temperature
range from room temperature to its decomposition temperature, and
explored its application as macromolecular solvent and reaction medium.19 However, the application of liquid-like PILs
as electrolytes for LIBs has not yet been investigated. Herein, we
shall report a novel PIL-based electrolyte, namely, MPIL, by mixing
a liquid-like poly(ionic liquid) with additives of 10 wt % propylene
carbonate (PC) and 0.1 M LiClO4 for LIBs. The MPIL electrolyte
exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 8.3 × 10–5 S cm–1 at 25 °C and 2.0 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 60 °C with a wide electrochemical
potential window up to 5.61 V at 25 °C and 4.14 V at 60 °C,
respectively. The Li/LiFePO4 batteries with MPIL electrolyte
show a reversible discharge-specific capacities of 137.4 and 110 mAh
g–1 at the current densities of 0.1 and 1C, respectively,
for the first cycle at 25 °C, which are maintained at 127.4 and
116.3 mAh g–1 after 100 cycles, respectively, with
Coulombic efficiency of 100%. Furthermore, the batteries show improved
performance at high temperature. The discharge-specific capacities
of the batteries reach 144 and 126 mAh g–1 at 0.1
and 1C, respectively, at 60 °C. The formation of a stable solid-electrolyte
interface (SEI) film at the lithium-electrolyte interface and the
stability of MPIL electrolyte during cycling were investigated and
discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
The ionic liquid
monomer, ATA, was prepared by the reaction of
equimolar of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) and
tris(dioxa-3,6-heptyl) amine (TDA) at room temperature. The chemical
structure of ATA was confirmed by 1H NMR and Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figures S1 and S3a, Supporting Information). The monomer ATA was then polymerized via
free radical polymerization to give poly(ionic liquid), PATA, as shown
in Scheme 1. The chemical
structure of PATA was further confirmed by 1H NMR and FTIR
spectra (Figures S2 and S3b, Supporting
Information). The obtained PATA has a molecular weight of 4.42 ×
104 g mol–1, with a molecular weight
polydispersity of 1.73 as measured by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
The PATA is a viscous liquid at room temperature with a very low glass
transition temperature of −51 °C measured by differential
scanning calorimeter (DSC) and a thermal decomposition temperature
of 202.8 °C measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figures S5 and S6, Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthesis Routines of ATA and PATA
To explore the usage of PATA as possible electrolyte for
LIBs,
we first investigated the electrochemical potential window and ionic
conductivity of PATA by using an electrochemical workstation. The
results indicated that PATA is stable up to the voltage of 4.62 V
at 25 °C as shown in Figure 1a, which is much higher than the charge cutoff voltage
of lithium–LiFePO4 (LFP) battery, i.e., 3.8 V.20Figure 1b shows that the ionic conductivity of PATA with 0.1 M LiClO4 increased with increase in temperature from 3.6 × 10–6 S cm–1 at 25 °C to 1.37 ×
10–4 S cm–1 at 80 °C. It
can be seen that the ionic conductivity of PATA at 25 °C is rather
low to be used as an electrolyte in LIBs, which is due to the high
viscosity of PATA, as shown in Figure 2a. Under the gravitation, the PATA hardly flowed in
the initial 30 min and it took more than 180 min to flow down to the
bottom of the glass bottle. To decrease the viscosity and hence enhance
the ionic conductivity of PATA, we mixed small amount of PC (10 wt
% of PATA) with PATA and 0.1 M LiClO4, which was coded
as MPIL. Figure 2b
shows that the flow behavior of MPIL was significantly improved, and
it only took 40 s to reach the bottom of the glass bottle. The amount
of PC additive was optimized by measuring the ionic conductivity of
PATA with 0.1 M LiClO4 and various amount of PC and testing
the cycling performance of LIBs with the corresponding mixtures as
electrolytes (Figure S7, Supporting Information).
The results of Figure S7 indicate that
the optimum amount of PC was 10 wt % of PATA. The MPIL shows the highest
ionic conductivity and the LIB with MPIL as the electrolyte exhibits
the best cycling performance. Furthermore, the fluidic behavior of
MPIL is largely improved and the chemical potential window of MPIL
is extended up to the voltage of 5.61 V at 25 °C (Figure 1a). The MPIL also exhibits
a significantly enhanced ionic conductivity of 8.3 × 10–5 S cm–1 at 25 °C (Figure 1b). Increasing the temperature to 60 °C
can stabilize the MPIL up to a voltage of 4.14 V with an ionic conductivity
of 2.0 × 10–4 S cm–1. The
increase in electrochemical window of MPIL might be attributed to
the following possible reasons. In the hybrid electrolyte, the poly(ionic
liquid) has better mobility and activity, so it can unite with the
surface active site of electrode more easily than that of pure PATA.
The electrode was then passivated by the poly(ionic liquid) and the
MPIL has a higher electrochemical window. On the other hand, the anodic
stability window is limited by the irreversible oxidation of the salt
anion.21 The addition of PC increases the
activity ability of poly(ionic liquid) molecular chains and hence
enhances the interaction between the −NH unit and SO3– and ClO4– anions,
which might suppress the oxidation of these anions. Furthermore, the
PC molecules are surrounded by large poly(ionic liquid) molecular
chains, which also suppress the oxidation of PC. The depression of
oxidation of salt anions and PC might cooperatively increase the electrochemical
stability window of MPIL. The above results indicate that MPIL exhibits
a wide potential window and a high ionic conductivity, rendering it
suitable as an electrolyte for the lithium–LiFePO4 battery.

Figure 3 shows the
current variation in a [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|Li metal cathode]
cell as a function of time under a polarization voltage of 10 mV at
25 °C. The lithium-ion transference number (tLi+), which relates to the concentration polarization
of electrolyte during the charging and discharging processes, can
be then calculated as 1  where I0 is the
initial current, Iss is the steady current, R0 is the initial lithium interfacial resistance, Rf is the final lithium interfacial resistance, Re0 is the initial electrolyte resistance, Ress is the final electrolyte resistance,
and ΔV is the polarization voltage of 10 mV.
From Figure 3, tLi+ is calculated to be 0.25 by using I0 = 8.8 μA, Iss = 6.2 μA, Re0 = 186.7
Ω, Ress = 190 Ω, R0 = 937.4 Ω, and Rf = 797.4 Ω. The tLi+ of 0.25 for MPIL is slightly higher than that of PEO-based
composite solid polymer electrolytes (i.e., ∼0.2) reported
by Chen et al.21

Figure 3 Current variation in
a [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|Li metal
cathode] cell as a function of time under a polarization voltage of
10 mV at 25 °C. The inset shows the alternating current impedance
spectra of the symmetrical cell before and after polarization.

The [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode]
batteries were then fabricated. The charge- and discharge-specific
capacities of the batteries were first investigated at various current
densities ranging from 0.1 to 5C (1.0C = 0.12 mA cm–2) under a voltage range of 2.7–3.8 V at 25 °C, as shown
in Figure 4. Because
of the Ohmic polarization, the charge and discharge capacities of
the batteries gradually decreased with increasing current density.
The charge and discharge capacities of the batteries at a current
density of 0.1C were 130.4 and 130.5 mAh g–1, respectively,
about 76.7 and 76.8% of the theoretical value, i.e., 170 mAh g–1. Furthermore, significant charge–discharge
platforms were observed. At a current density of 1C, the charge-specific
capacity only reduced to 75.6% of the original. Although increasing
the current density to 5C resulted in a low discharge-specific capacity
of only 29.6 mAh g–1, the discharge-specific capacity
of the battery recovered back to 127.3 mAh g–1 when
the current density turned back to 0.1C (Figure 4b).

Figure 4 (a) Charge and discharge curves for [Li metal
anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode] batteries
measured at various current densities
at 25 °C. (b) Rate performance of the batteries at 25 °C.

Figure 5a shows
the long-term cycling performance and the corresponding Coulombic
efficiency of [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based
cathode] batteries at various current densities at 25 °C during
charge–discharge processes between 2.7 and 3.8 V. For the first
cycle, the reversible discharge-specific capacities of the batteries
were 137.4, 127, 112.6, and 110 mAh g–1 at 0.1,
0.2, 0.5, and 1C, respectively. After running over 100 cycles, the
discharge-specific capacities of the batteries were 127.4, 123.3,
119.2, and 116.3 mAh g–1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1C,
respectively, which indicated an excellent retention rate. The Coulombic
efficiency was close to 100% at all current densities studied here,
except for the first cycle. This outstanding cycling stability with
a Coulombic efficiency of about 100% indicated that MPIL is an excellent
electrolyte for lithium–LFP battery. These results are better
than those reported by Lu et al.17 The
reported Li/LiFePO4 half-cell equipped with the PIL/30PC
film shows an initial discharge-specific capacity of 120.4 mAh g–1 with the corresponding Coulombic efficiency of 89.1%
at 0.1C.17 However, the specific capacity
of the battery decreases to 99.2 mAh g–1 in the
30th cycle.17

Figure 5 (a) Cycling stability
of [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode]
batteries at various current densities at
25 °C. (b) Cycling stability of [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode] batteries at the current density of 1C at
25, 50, and 60 °C, respectively.

We further tested the cycling performance of the batteries
at elevated
temperatures. Figure 5b shows that the [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode] batteries also exhibited excellent cycling stability
with a Coulombic efficiency of about 100% at 50 and 60 °C. The
discharge-specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency for the first
cycle increased with increasing temperature. However, the discharge-specific
capacity of LIB running at 60 °C decreased slightly more than
that at 50 °C because the lithium dendrites might grow faster
at high temperature (see below).

The charge- and discharge-specific
capacities of the batteries
at 60 °C were also investigated at various current densities
ranging from 0.1 to 5C under a voltage range of 2.7–3.8 V,
as shown in Figure 6, which shows that the charge- and discharge-specific capacities
of the battery at a current density of 0.1C at 60 °C were 154
and 144 mAh g–1, respectively, higher than the corresponding
values at 25 °C. The low charge–discharge platforms were
observed, indicating that the cell polarization effect of LIBs was
low. With the current density of 1C, the charge and discharge capacities
of the battery at 60 °C were 128 and 125.8 mAh g–1, respectively. Especially, when the current density was increased
to 5C, the charge and discharge capacities of the battery at 60 °C
were 105 and 100 mAh g–1, respectively, more than
3 times the values at 25 °C (cf. Figure 4). Similarly, the discharge-specific capacity
of the battery recovered back to 135 mAh g–1 when
the current density turned back from 5 to 0.1C (Figure 6b). These results further indicated that
the LIBs using MPIL as electrolyte have better performance at higher
temperature. These results are also better than those reported by
Wang et al.,16 who reported that the PVIMTFSI-co-PPEGMA/LiTFSI-based LiFePO4/Li battery shows
the discharge-specific capacities of 136 and 70 mAh g–1 at 0.1 and 1C, respectively, at 60 °C.

Figure 6 (a) Charge and discharge
curves for [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based
cathode] batteries measured at various current densities
at 60 °C. (b) Rate performance of the batteries at 60 °C.

To gain a further understanding
of the interfacial characteristics
between MPIL/Li metal anode at high temperature, the charge–discharge
cycling test of the lithium symmetrical cell at 60 °C was performed
and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) before and after
the test was also measured. Figure 7a shows the voltage–time profiles of the cell
running for 100 cycles at 0.1 mA cm–2 at 60 °C.
As we can see, there are no sudden voltage fluctuations during the
test, which indicates that the SEI film formed on the lithium-metal
anode was stable and no short-circuit effect occurred. Figure 7b shows the impedance spectra
of the lithium symmetrical cell before and after running for 100 cycles
at 0.1 mA cm−2 at 60 °C. And the modified Randles-type
equivalent circuit obtained by computer simulations with the ZView
software is also given as inset in Figure 7b. The intercept of the semicircle in the
high-frequency region at the real axis is ascribed to the electrolyte
bulk resistance (Rb), the diameter of
the semicircle represents the interfacial resistance (Ri) of the MPIL/lithium-metal anode and the double-layer
capacitor is replaced with a constant phase element, and Zw is the Warburg diffusion. The Rb is determined to be 104.9 Ω before the cycle and 104
Ω after the cycle, respectively. The almost invariable Rb implies that the MPIL can be stable during
the test. Furthermore, the Ri slightly
reduces from 844 to 712 Ω after the cycling test, indicating
the good compatibility between the MPIL and lithium metal.

cell (a) cycling and (b) EIS results of a cell containing
MPIL electrolyte: 16 mm Li disk, constant current (0.1 mA cm–2) for 16 min, 100 cycles at 60 °C.

The surface morphology of the lithium anode after 100 cycles
under
various testing conditions was observed by using scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) to gain further understanding of the cycling behavior
of the batteries. Figures 8 and S8 show that the morphology
of lithium dendrite formed on the surface of lithium-metal electrode
after 100 cycles. More lithium dendrites were observed at high C-rate.
When increasing the temperature, the lithium dendrite begins to pierce
the fiberglass diaphragm and large area lithium dendrites in fiberglass
diaphragm can be seen at 1C and 60 °C (Figure 8d), which might result in the decrease in
discharge-specific capacity of LIB running at 60 °C (cf. Figure 5b). Note that the
white striped objects in the SEM images are the fibers from the fiberglass
diaphragm.

and (d) 1C and 60 °C.

The stability of the electrolyte during the charge and discharge
process is very important for the usage of LIBs. The in situ differential
electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurement was further carried
out to study the stability of MPIL in LIBs. Normally, the PC-based
electrolyte and ether electrolyte tender to decompose and produce
gas during the charge–discharge process of LIBs.22−24Figure 9 shows that
there is not significant CO2 generation during the charge–discharge
process, indicating that the MPIL electrolyte was electrochemically
stable and did not decompose during the running of LIBs at the current
density of 1C at 25 °C.

electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode] battery running at the

3 Conclusions
In summary, a novel PIL-based electrolyte, MPIL, by mixing a liquid-like
poly(ionic liquid) with additives of 10 wt % propylene carbonate (PC)
and 0.1 M LiClO4, was fabricated and successfully applied
in LIBs. The MPIL electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of
8.3 × 10–5 S cm–1 at 25 °C
or 2.0 × 10–4 S cm–1 at 60
°C with a wide electrochemical potential window up to 5.61 V
at 25 °C or 4.14 V at 60 °C. The Li/LiFePO4 batteries
with MPIL electrolyte achieve high capacity, outstanding cycling stability,
and rate capability at 25 °C and improved performance at high
temperature up to 60 °C, which are attributed to the formation
of stable SEI film at the Li–MPIL interface and the stability
of MPIL during cycling. Such MPIL electrolyte might find wide potential
application in LIBs with enhanced safety performance.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic
acid (AMPS, J&K, 98%), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4)
(Aladdin, 99.99% metals basis), and tris(dioxa-3,6-heptyl)amine (TDA,
J&K, 95%) were used without further purification. 2,2-Azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN, Aladdin) was recrystallized and propylene carbonate (PC, Aladdin,
99.7%) was dried by 3A molecular sieve before use.

4.2 Synthesis of Ionic Liquid Monomer and Poly(ionic
liquid)
The ionic liquid monomer, ATA, was synthesized by
adding 2.07 g AMPS (0.01 mol) and 3.23 g TDA (0.01 mol) into a round
flask and stirring at room temperature for 12 h. The obtained monomer
ATA (5.30 g, 0.01 mol) was then polymerized via free-radical polymerization
with 0.0328 g AIBN (2 × 10–4 mol) as an initiator
to give poly(ionic liquid), PATA. Briefly, 2% AIBN was added to ATA
and polymerization was carried out at 80 °C for 8 h. After polymerization,
the reaction mixture was dissolved in 10 mL acetone and then precipitated
by 50 mL diethyl ether. The obtained PATA was yellow viscous liquid
at the bottom of the glass beaker, which was carefully separated by
a separating funnel, dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h, and then
kept in the glovebox for further uses.

4.3 Preparation
of the Electrolyte and Cathode
for Lithium-Ion Battery
The poly(ionic liquid) electrolyte
used for lithium-ion battery in the present work consisted of 90 wt
% PATA, 10 wt % PC, and 0.1 M LiClO4. The poly(ionic liquid)-based
electrolyte was prepared in a glovebox by simple mixing of the three
components and coded as MPIL for short. The cathode used herein was
LiFePO4-based, which was prepared by mixing LiFePO4, poly(vinylidene fluoride), and carbon black in a weight
ratio of 8:1:1 and aluminum foil as the current collector. The cathode
was dried in vacuum at 80 °C for 24 h and then transferred into
glovebox before use.

4.4 Characterizations
1H NMR
spectrum was recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer using dimethylsulfoxide-d6 as solvent. The molecular weight and molecular
weight distribution of PATA were measured by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) using a Water GPC and 0.1 M NaNO3 aqueous solutions
as the eluent with a flow rate of 0.80 mL min–1 at
30 °C. The FTIR spectrum was recorded on a Vector 22 Bruker spectrometer.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by using a TGA Q50
instrument with a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under N2 atmosphere. The glass transition temperatures
of ATA and PATA were measured by using a differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC Q20) with a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min–1 under N2 atmosphere. The temperature range for DSC measurement
was set as −50–80 °C. The scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) measurements were carried out on a Hitachi S-4800 SEM.

4.5 Electrochemical Performance Evaluation
The electrochemical
stability and potential windows of PATA and MPIL
were characterized by using a Bio-logic VMP3 multichannel potentiostatic–galvanostatic
system. Linear sweep voltammetry measurements were carried out from
the open-circuit voltage to 5 V (PATA) or 6 V (MPIL) vs Li/Li+ with a potential scan rate of 1 mV s–1.
The conductivities of the PATA with 0.1 M LiClO4 and MPIL
at various temperatures were also characterized by the same instrument
with a 2-electrode Swagelok cell, in which a coin-like shaped membrane
(1.13 cm2 area and 0.044 cm thickness) was sandwiched between
two stainless steel pistons. The conductivity (σ) was given
as 2  where d is the thickness
of the membrane (cm), A is the geometrical area of
the membrane (cm2), and R is the resistance
calculated by the intercept of the curve with the real axis on the
Nyquist plot (Ω).

The [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|Li
metal cathode] button cells were fabricated. A polarization voltage
of 10 mV was given by the Bio-logic VMP3 multichannel potentiostatic–galvanostatic
system for 5 h until the polarization current was stable. The impedance
of the button cell was characterized by electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) scanning on the Bio-logic VMP3 multichannel potentiostatic–galvanostatic
system with the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 MHz with a perturbation
amplitude of 5 mV.

The [Li metal anode|MPIL electrolyte|LiFePO4-based cathode]
batteries were fabricated. The LiFePO4-based cathode was
prepared as described above. The charge and discharge tests of the
batteries at various current densities and temperature were conducted
on LANHE system with a voltage range between 2.7 and 3.8 V. The in
situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) measurement
was carried out by using a Hiden HPR-20 with 1.5 mL min–1 Ar air flow between 2.7 and 3.8 V.
