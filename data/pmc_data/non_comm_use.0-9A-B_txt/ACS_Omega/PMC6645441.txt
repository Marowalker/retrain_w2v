Low-cost
and ecofriendly porous biocarbons were fabricated from
konjaku flour via precarbonization and potassium hydroxide (KOH) activation.
The obtained biocarbon ACK-5 derived from a precarbonized
carbon/potassium hydroxide (KOH) mass ratio of 1:5 possessed an ultrahigh
specific surface area of 1403 m2 g–1 and
hierarchical porous structures with the existence of micro- to macropores.
When ACK-5 was employed as a supercapacitor electrode in
6 M KOH, it showed a high specific capacitance of 216 F g–1 and excellent cycling stability with capacitance retention remaining
93.7% after 5000 cycles. Moreover, the ACK-5 sample acquired
a supramaximal specific capacitance of 609 F g–1, and the high energy density of ACK-5//ACK-5 symmetrical cells reached up to 9.2 Wh kg–1 when p-phenylenediamine serving as a redox electrolyte was added
into KOH electrolyte. The reported simple fabrication strategy would
leverage a green biomass precursor for the preparation of supercapacitors.

1 Introduction
The exhaustion of fossil fuels and the increasing seriousness of
environmental issues have drawn great attention toward high-performance
energy storage devices.1,2 Supercapacitors have come to the
fore due to their high power, quick charging time, and long service
life.3,4 Carbon materials, such as activated carbons,5 carbon nanotubes,6 carbon foams,7 and graphene,8 have been largely used as supercapacitor electrodes.
Among them, activated carbons have been regarded as the most promising
candidates for practical supercapacitor devices due to their simple
synthesis processes, low equipment requirements, high surface areas,
and low cost.9,10 Especially, activated carbons
possessing hierarchical pore structures would greatly enhance the
capacitance of supercapacitors: the micropores (<2 nm) store charge
during charging–discharging processes and ensure the large
specific surface areas, the mesopores (2–50 nm) provide transfer
channels for electrolyte ions, while the macropores (>50 nm) as
reservoirs
for electrolytes facilitate the contact of electrolytes and electrodes.11,12

Recently, abundant sustainable biomass, such as rice straw,13 pistachio nutshells,14 eggplant,15 kapok fiber,16 elm samara,17Perilla frutescens,18 etc.,
have been used as fascinating precursors of activated carbon materials
for supercapacitor electrodes. Biomass-derived carbons have exceptional
advantages like simple preparation, renewability, inherent porosity,
and wide availability. Moreover, the doping atoms (e.g., N or B) from
the parent biomass usually can improve the capacitive performances
of porous biocarbons by changing the electronic properties of the
carbon matrix and are accompanied by the additional pseudocapacitance
by Faradaic reactions.19,20

Konjaku flour is produced
from the tuberous roots of fresh konjac,
which contains cellulose, vitamin, and polysaccharide (konjac glucomannan).21 China is the first major producer of konjaku
flour in the world. Moreover, konjaku flour is not the main food source
of human beings. Furthermore, the porous carbon skeleton can be left
behind after the decomposition of konjac glucomannan through anaerobic
pyrolysis and activation process, and heteroatoms in the carbon structures
originate from high-temperature carbonization of amino acids and crude
proteins.22 Therefore, konjaku flour with
a large yield and abundant sources is indeed a superior biological
precursor of porous biocarbons for supercapacitor electrodes.

In this work, porous biocarbons were fabricated by using konjaku
flour as the precursor through precarbonization and subsequent potassium hydroxide (KOH)
activation. The obtained biocarbon materials from konjaku flour achieved
high specific surface areas and hierarchical porous structures, which
could provide abundant storage sites and facilitate the charge transport.
At the same time, due to nitrogen doping in the carbon structures,
the biocarbons obtained high wettability and pseudocapacitance as
supercapacitor electrodes. Moreover, p-phenylenediamine
(PPD) as a redox additive was added to the KOH electrolyte to remarkably
improve the specific capacitance through a redox reaction as well
as the resultant energy density of the assembled symmetric supercapacitor.

2 Results and Discussion
Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of CK-700 in Figure 1a shows abundant
pores and cavities with a smooth surface, which formed from the deprivation
of organic matter and volatilization of some small molecules during
the pyrolysis process.23 Relative to CK-700, the pore walls of the activated porous biocarbon ACk-3, 5, and 7 (Figure 1b–d) were more plicated and fragmentized due to the
etching effect of KOH.24 Although the three
biocarbon samples possess porous network structures, in comparison
with ACK-3 and ACK-7, ACK-5 had thicker
hole walls and more nanometer porous construction in the hole walls.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of ACK-5.

The TEM images (Figure 1e,f) further demonstrate the
existence of a rich nanometer
porous structure in ACK-5, which corresponds with the SEM
observation (Figure 1c). This was credited to the added amount of KOH in ACK-3 being less, due to which sufficient etching could not be generated.
With the increase in KOH amount, thin pore walls have been removed
and more nanoporous structure generated on the thick hole walls of
ACK-5. On the other hand, the amount of KOH activating
agent was too much in ACK-7, and it led to plicated pore
walls and fragmentized cavities that resulted from excessive etching.
In brief, the ACK-5 biocarbon possessed more small pores,
suggesting that it had a large specific area and an excellent electrochemical
behavior.

Figure S1 presents Fourier
transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra of all of the obtained biocarbons. A broad
and feeble peak and an obvious peak that emerged at 3400 and 1.90
cm–1 were attributed to the stretching vibrations
of O–H and N–H, and the C=C tensile deformation
vibration of benzene rings, respectively.25,26 Two other characteristic peaks located at 1350 and 1200 cm–1 corresponded to C–N and C–O stretching vibrations,
respectively.27 The nitrogen- and oxygen-containing
groups that existed in the biocarbon samples might have resulted from
the konjac glucomannan and amino acids in the konjaku flour after
annealing.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses in Figure 2a exhibit two peaks centered
at approximately
24 and 43° of CK-700, ACK-3, ACK-5, and ACK-7, respectively, corresponding to the (002)
and (100) lattice planes of graphite crystal.28 Two distinct bands located at approximately 1350 and 1590 cm–1 in the Raman spectra (Figure 2b) were D band and G band, respectively.29 The ID/IG values of CK-700, ACK-3, ACK-5, and ACK-7, were 0.96, 0.99, 1.04, and 1.03,
respectively, which indicated the generation of the abundant structural
defects after KOH etching.30 Apparently,
the largest ID/IG value for ACK-5 could reveal the existence of
heteroatom doping and rich micropores.

(c) micropore size distributions obtained by the Horváth–Kawazoe
method and (d) mesopore size distributions obtained by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method of the obtained biocarbon samples.

N2 sorption isothermals of all samples (Figure S2) were composed of type-I and type-IV,
which implied the existence of micropores and mesopores.31 In comparison with CK-700, the three
ACK samples possessed a faster and greater adsorption when
the relative pressure was below 0.1, and an obvious hysteresis loop
appeared at a high relative pressure over 0.5, which implied that
more micropores and mesopores existed.32 Additionally, there was a small steep adsorption at the high relative
pressure (0.9–1.0) for all of the carbon samples, suggesting
the existence of macropores.28 The distributions
of micropore and mesopore sizes of the biocarbons are clearly shown
in Figure 2c–d.
Specifically, the pore distribution of CK-700 was mainly
centered at 0.4 nm with a weak peak in the range of 1–3 nm,
whereas the pore sizes of ACK were highly concentrated
in approximately 1 nm with abundant mesopores. This may be resulting
from more micropores and mesopores formed by the etching of KOH. Detailed
data of the biocarbon samples are listed in Table 1 with the largest SBET values and total pore volume of ACK-5 being
1403 m2 g–1 and 0.87 cm3 g–1, respectively.

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) characterization in Figure 3 was carried out
to confirm the chemical composition of ACK-5, demonstrating
the coexistence of C (86.22 atom %), N (1.88 atom %), and O (11.9
atom %) elements (Figure 3a). Six branches of peaks could be obtained to best fit the
high-resolution C 1s spectrum of ACK-5 (Figure 3b). The strong-intensity C–C
peak (284.8 eV) and C=C signal (285.1 eV) suggested that it
was dominated by sp3 carbon in the ACK-5, and
some amorphous carbons were transformed into a graphite state. The
other three peaks located at 286.3, 287.9, and 289.5 eV corresponded
to C–O, C=O, and HO–C=O bonds, respectively.
These peaks revealed massive oxygen-containing groups’ residues
in the ACK-5 after activation. The high-resolution O 1s
spectrum in Figure 3c could be divided into C–O (532.8 eV), C=O (531.4
eV), and −OH (533.4 eV). Another faint peak corresponded to
the C–N bond (285.2 eV), proving that a few N atoms were already
doped into the ACK-5 carbon frameworks. From the high-resolution
N 1s spectrum in Figure 3d, the pyridinic-N peak (398.7 eV), pyrrolic-N peak (400.4 eV), and
graphitic-N peak (402.6 eV) were rooted in the pyrolyzation process
of amino acids and crude proteins in the konjaku flour. From the above
analyses, we can conclude that ACK-5 was decorated with
abundant oxygen-containing groups and a small number of nitrogen-containing
groups, and it might exhibit outstanding wettability and capacitance.

The capacitive performances of the as-obtained porous biocarbons
were evaluated by a three-electrode system in 6 M KOH solution. The
cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves at 50 mV s–1 are
illustrated in Figure 4a. ACK-3, ACK-5, and ACK-7 showed
nearly rectangular CV curves, which is the characteristic of a double-layer
capacitor.33 Moreover, the curves formed
a small hump due to the pseudofaradaic redox reactions of heteroatoms.18 Clearly, ACK-5 exhibited enhanced
specific capacitance compared with other biocarbons. Figure 4b illustrates the CV curves
of ACK-5 at various scan rates within 5–300 mV s–1. The curve maintained a relatively good quasi-rectangular
shape and underwent no change even when the scan rates increased to
300 mV s–1. Figure 4c shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD)
plots at a 1 A g–1 current density. According to
the calculation of discharge time, the specific capacitances (Cs) of CK-700, ACK-3, ACK-5, and ACK-7, were 152, 187, 216, and 190 F g–1, respectively. Figure 4d depicts the GCD curves of ACK-5 at a current
density interval from 1 to 10 A g–1. Apparently,
the shapes of the GCD curves were symmetrical and nearly linear with
a small curvature, suggesting an excellent capacitive behavior of
the electrical double layer with little pseudocapacitance (deriving
from heteroatoms) and good characteristics of capacitive reversibility.34 For comparison, the capacitance retention of
CK-700, ACK-3, and ACK-7 are also
provided in Figure 4e, and it was clear that ACK-5 possessed a larger value
compared with other biocarbons.

a scan rate of 50 mV s–1; (b) CV curves of ACK-5 at different scan
rates; (c) GCD curves of the four biocarbons at a current density
of 1 A g–1; (d) GCD curves of ACK-5;
(e) specific capacitances of the four biocarbons at different current
densities; (f) cycling stabilities of the biocarbons at 100 mV s–1.

Moreover, the specific
capacitance of previously as-published activated
biocarbons from biomass is summarized in Table S1, and it can be seen that the ACK-5 in this work
exhibits an excellent electrochemical performance at 1 A g–1 current density. The excellent rate performance of ACK-5 was explained as follows: (1) hierarchical porosity, a large specific
area, and proper pore size distribution could effectively provide
more electrolyte contact and transfer channels for electrolyte ions
and a reservoir for electrolytes, facilitating the fast diffusion
of ions at high current density, and thus increase the charge storage
density; (2) the heteroatomic doping could greatly enhance the electrical
wettability or conductivity and thus reduce the diffusion resistance
of electrolyte ion transfer. Cycling stabilities of the four biocarbons
were measured at 100 mV s–1 (Figure 4f), and the curves showed that all of the
materials maintained ultrahigh stability after 5000 CV cycles, which
may have corresponded to the stability of porous biocarbon structures.
Especially, ACK-5 obtained high stability in KOH with the
specific capacitance maintained at 93.7%, owing to the heteroatom
doping and porous structures, which facilitate the effective and steady
transfer of ions and electrons on the interface of the electrode.
However, there is a capacitance fading of 6.3% after 5000 cycles.
The key factor responsible for the capacitance fading might be the
increase of charge transfer resistance due to the presence of the
surface functionalities or impurities contained in the activated carbon
electrodes.35

The Nyquist plots of
biocarbons are shown in Figure S3. The
equivalent series resistance of ACK-5 (0.8 Ω) was
smaller than that of other biocarbons. Meanwhile,
ACK-5 displayed a lower resistance value (0.6 Ω)
and a lower Warburg impedance compared with other biocarbons due to
the vast electron transfer pathways offered by micro- and mesopores.36−38 Additionally, a vertical bar along the y-axis at
low frequencies was characteristic of the capacitive behavior of the
ideal electrical double layer capacitors.39

To explore the effect of the redox mediator PPD, the electrochemical
performances were measured in KOH electrolyte with different concentrations
of PPD. A pair of intense oxidation reduction peaks in the CV curves
was observed in Figure S4a. The two peaks
existed at approximately −0.2 and −0.6 V, respectively,
which was due to the state conversion of p-phenylenediamine/p-phenylenediimine on the interfaces of electrodes/electrolyte.31 There was a highly reversible redox reaction
with the generation of two protons and charges in PPD during the charge–discharge
process, and the CV curves have lost their rectangular shape compared
with the KOH electrolyte.40 Furthermore,
the specific capacitance of ACK-5 was obviously heightened
by introducing the pseudocapacitance of PPD. Figure S4b further confirmed the above analyses: the GCD curves of
ACK-5 possessed a typical symmetrical triangle profile
with KOH electrolyte, whereas there were two gentle slopes in the
GCD curves in KOH electrolyte with different concentrations of PPD.
Clearly, the specific capacitance of ACK-5 reached up to
609 F g–1 when the additional amount of PPD was
0.5 mM, which was 3 times as much as that in 6 M KOH electrolyte.
However, the specific capacitance went down with excess PPD concentration
in the KOH electrolyte, which may be due to the decrease of the conductivity
and capacitive performance in the electrolyte system caused by the
electrolyte phase separation and the accumulation of free ions and
charge.41

To further explore the
practical application for supercapacitors,
the assembled ACK-5//ACK-5 symmetrical cells
were measured in the 6 M KOH and 6 M KOH + 0.5 mM PPD electrolytes,
respectively. The GCD curves of ACK-5//ACK-5
symmetrical cells in the KOH electrolyte formed an isosceles triangle
corresponding to three-electrode analysis (Figure 5a). Based on the total mass of the two electrodes,
the specific capacitances (Ct) were calculated
to be 40.0, 33.0, 27.8, and 22.2 F g–1 at current
densities of 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 A g–1, respectively. Figure 5b validated that
there were two obvious humps in two-electrode GCD curves with the
addition of 0.5 mM PPD into the 6 M KOH electrolyte, which was due
to the introduction of pseudocapacitance.42 The specific capacitances were overtly improved, which increased
to 65.5, 58.3, 52.0, and 40.5 F g–1 at 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, and 5.0 A g–1, respectively.

diode (LED) lighted by the ACK-5//ACK-5 device.

The ragone plots are shown in Figure 5c, reflecting the
relationship of energy
density and power density. At a power density of 0.25 kW kg–1, the ACK-5//ACK-5 symmetrical supercapacitor
showed the maximum energy density of 5.6 and 9.2 Wh kg–1 in 6 M KOH and 6 M KOH + 0.5 mM PPD of electrolytes, respectively.
Additionally, the value of energy densities still maintained at 3.1
and 5.6 Wh kg–1, respectively, even the two-electrode
system has high power density of 2.5 kW kg–1. The
high energy density and power density of ACK-5//ACK-5 symmetrical cells have also been confirmed by comparing
with various biocarbons (Table S2). The
cycling stability tests (Figure S5) of
ACK-5//ACK-5 showed that the capacitance was
retained 89.7% in 6 M KOH electrolyte after 5000 CV, while the value
was 73.4% in 6 M KOH + 0.5 mM PPD electrolyte due to a portion of
PPD being decomposed during the 5000 CV processes43 To demonstrate the practical application of the supercapacitor,
two ACK-5//ACK-5 symmetrical cells were assembled
in series to light a yellow LED (Figure 5d). More importantly, the LED still remained
bright for 180 s after being charged for 80 s at 2.0 V.

3 Conclusions
Hierarchical porous biocarbons were prepared
from konjaku flour
through carbonization and further KOH activation processes for supercapacitor
application. The obtained biocarbons exhibited large specific surface
areas with ample porous structures and excellent electrochemical performances.
The N and O heteroatoms inherently incorporated into the carbon framework
increased the specific capacitances by introducing pseudocapacitances.
Especially, ACK-5 acquired a high specific capacitance
of 216 F g–1 and a preeminent cycling stability
of 93.7% in KOH electrolyte, whereas a greater specific capacitance
of 609 F g–1 and a significantly improved energy
density of 9.2 Wh kg–1 were obtained when PPD redox
electrolyte was added to the KOH electrolyte. Therefore, a cost-efficient
and direct strategy has been developed to construct porous biocarbon,
which is expected to be commercially produced as high-performance
supercapacitor electrode materials.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Konjaku flour was directly
purchased from local supermarkets (Fujian, China). Air-laid papers
and p-phenylenediamine were respectively obtained
from Shenzhen Chenyan Trading Co., Ltd. (Guangdong, China) and Shanghai
Chemical Reagent Company (Shanghai, China). Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
was acquired from Lanxi Xuri Chemical engineering Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang,
China) and diluted to a concentration of 1 M. Potassium hydroxide
(KOH) was received from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai,
China).

4.2 Preparation of the Porous Carbons
A typical procedure for the preparation of ACK-x as an electrode is illustrated in Scheme 1. In detail, konjaku flour was pyrolyzed
at 400 °C under nitrogen flow to obtain precarbonized porous
carbon with a heating rate of 5 °C min–1 for
1 h. The precarbonized porous carbon (1 g) and appropriate KOH were
stirred together for 5 h in 30 mL of deionized water. The mixture
solution was dried at 60 °C for 24 h to gain a precursor. Then,
the precursor was pyrolyzed at 700 °C under nitrogen for 1 h.
Subsequently, the acquired products were washed by 1 M HCl solution
and were then dried at 60 °C for 24 h. The obtained porous biocarbons
(ACK) are denoted as ACK-3, ACK-5,
and ACK-7, which represents that the mass ratio of KOH
to the precarbonized porous carbon was 3:1, 5:1, and 7:1, respectively.
CK-700 was obtained from the directed carbonization of
konjaku flour at 700 °C without adding KOH activation.

Illustration of the Preparation of ACK-x for Electrodes
4.3 Characterization
The surface microstructures
of biocarbon products were represented through scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM, Carl Zeiss ULTRA 55) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM, FEI TECNAI G2 F30). A Nicolet FT-IR 5700 spectrophotometer was
used for characterizing the asymmetric constructions of functional
groups of the samples. Phase information was performed on X-ray diffractometer
patterns (XRD, ULTIMA III). Raman spectra were characterized by a
ThermoFisher DXR2xi Raman spectrometer. The X-ray photoelectron (XPS)
spectrum was obtained through an ESCALAB 250 X-ray spectrometer. A
Micromeritics 3Flex analyzer was applied to observe the BET specific
surface areas and porous size distributions.

4.4 Electrochemical
Measurements
Electrochemical
measurements were performed through a CHI660E electrochemical workstation
(Chenhua Instruments Co.). Platinum wire, Ag/AgCl, and working electrodes
made up a typical three-electrode system for electrode testing. Two
6 M KOH solutions contained different PPD concentrations as electrolytes.
Working electrodes were fabricated by mixing a fully grinded carbon
sample (85 wt %), acetylene black conductive additive (10 wt %), and
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) binder (5 wt %) to obtain a slurry. The
slurry was pressed onto a stainless steel mesh (1 cm × 1 cm),
and was finally dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Subsequently, a mass
of approximately 4 mg cm–2 was loaded onto each
electrode. Specific capacitances (Cs)
in the three-electrode system were obtained through calculation from
the discharge time of the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD)
tests, or by computation from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curve areas,
and they were under a current density range of 1–10 A g–1 and a potential window of −1.0–0 V,
respectively. Under 0.01–100 kHz scanning frequencies, electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy was used for exploring the transfer resistance
of the charge and ions.

The symmetrical supercapacitor was assembled
by a sandwich method, where two identical electrodes were inserted
into an air-laid paper as a separator. Values of specific capacitance
(Ct), energy density (E), and power density (P) were obtained by calculating
the following equations 1   2   3  where I (A) represents
the
discharge current, Δt (s) is the discharge
time, m represents the total mass of biocarbon materials
in the two electrodes, and ΔV (V) is the discharge
voltage.
