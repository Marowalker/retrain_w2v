Recently, the fabrication of semicrystalline
polymer foams with a nanocellular structure by supercritical fluids
has been becoming a newly developing research hotspot, owing to their
peculiar properties and prospective applications. In this work, a
facile and effective isothermal crystallization-induced method was
proposed to prepare nanocellular semicrystalline poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) foams using CO2 as a physical blowing agent. Styrene–acrylonitrile–glycidyl
methacrylate (SAG) as a chain extender (CE) was introduced into PLA
through a melt-mixing method to improve the crystallization behavior
and melt viscoelasticity of PLA. The chain extension reaction between
PLA and SAG occurred successfully as well as the branching and micro
cross-linking structures were generated in chain-extended PLA (CPLA)
samples, which were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectra,
gel fraction, and intrinsic viscosity measurements. Owing to the nucleation
effect of branching points and the restricted movement of PLA molecular
chains by the formation of branching and/or microcross-linking structures,
a large number of small spherocrystals were generated in CPLA samples,
which was beneficial to produce nanocells. Nanocellular CPLA foams
were prepared successfully, when the foaming temperature was 125 °C.
As the SAG content increased, the cell size of various PLA foams decreased
from 364 ± 198 to 249 ± 100 nm and their volume expansion
ratio increased from 1.15 ± 0.05 to 2.22 ± 0.01 times, gradually.
When the foaming temperature increased from 125 to 127 °C, an
interesting transition from nanocells to microcells could be observed
in CPLA foam with the CE content of 2 wt %. Finally, the formation
mechanism of nanocells in various PLA foams was proposed and clarified
using a schematic diagram.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In recent years,
nanocellular polymer foams had aroused great interest in the scientific
community because of their unique properties and promising applications.1 Nanocellular polymer foams are generally defined
as having the cell size less than 1 micron and the cell density greater
than 1012 cells/cm3.2,3 As
a kind of newly developed material, nanocellular polymer foams possessed
ultralow thermal conductivity and high toughness because of the Knudsen
effect and the small cell size in the nanoscale, respectively.4−7 Therefore,
they could be used in the fields of insulating materials, separation
membranes, catalytic or dielectric applications, and so on.8,9

The preparation method of nanocellular polymer foams included:
phase separation method,10 sol–gel
techniques,11 molecular imprinting,12 batch-foaming method in an autoclave,3 extrusion-foaming method,3 injection molding,13 and so on. In the
methods stated above, the batch-foaming method in the autoclave by
supercritical fluids had been proven to be a flexible and controllable
method for the manufacture of nanocellular polymer foams.14

Currently, five kinds of polymers could
be employed to prepare nanocellular foam: amorphous polymer,8 acrylic copolymer,15 block copolymer with a high CO2-philic nano-sized dispersed
phase segments,16 polymer blend-containing
nano-templates,17 and polymer composites.18 Amorphous polymers with an extremely large viscoelasticity
could significantly restrict cell growth and coalescence. Nanocellular
foams with cell sizes between 100 and 300 nm as well as relative densities
between 0.15 and 0.3 were produced using acrylic copolymers and silica
nanoparticles.19 Low-density nanocellular
poly(methyl methacrylate) foam with an average cell size of 235 nm
has been prepared at a very extremely low saturation temperature of
−30 °C.20

As a renewable
resource-based aliphatic semicrystalline polyester, poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) could be biodegraded and composted under favorable conditions.21,22 Compared with common PLA foams, nanocellular PLA foams could provide
excellent properties for high value-added applications in the fields
of membranes, sensors, and insulation materials.23 However, three big problems still existed in the fabrication
of nanocellular PLA foams. First, the melt strength of PLA was low
and its foamability was poor, which would promote the cell growth
and mergence, leading to the formation of large cells.24 Second, the presence of the crystalline region
(big spherocrystals) may impede the solubility and diffusion of blowing
agent, which may further affect the cell nucleation and growth of
PLA. Third, the cell nucleation point number in PLA melt without other
foreign fillers, and/or the second phase was not adequate to meet
the requirement of nanocellular polymer foams.25

In order to solve the aforementioned problems, a
rapid cooling foaming method was employed to prepare nanocellular
chain-extended PLA (CPLA) foams in an autoclave by supercritical nitrogen,
in which their average cell size could reach 600 nm.23 A similar rapid cooling foaming method was employed to
produce nanocellular PLA bead foams with a double crystal-melting
peak structure with supercritical CO2 in the autoclave.
The volume expansion ratio (VER) of PLA bead foams could reach 30-fold
and their average cell sizes ranged from 350 nm to 15 μm.26 In our previous study, a methodology of polymer
blending and rapid cooling foaming was used to generate a complex
cellular structure with large cells in microsize and small cells in
nanosize in semicrystalline PLA foams, in which the small cell size
could reach 396 nm.14

Herein, we
proposed a simple, facile, economical, environmentally friendly, and
supercritical CO2 foaming-based method to prepare PLA nanocellular
foams induced by isothermal crystallization. In this research, styrene–acrylonitrile–glycidyl
methacrylate (SAG) as the chain extender (CE) was introduced into
the PLA matrix to provide two obvious advantages. One was that the
melt viscoelasticity of PLA may be improved to restrict cell growth
and mergence. The other was that the spherocrystal size and number
of PLA may be changed to increase cell density. The thermal properties,
rheological properties, and foaming performance of various PLA samples
were researched in detail. Moreover, the effect of SAG contents and
foaming temperature on the cellular structural evolution of various
PLA foams was also studied. This study was anticipated to give a useful
method for preparing the nanocells in other semicrystalline polymers.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Torque Curves
The
chemical reaction between PLA and SAG could be qualitatively analyzed
by changes in the torque values of various PLA samples.27 In Figure 1, a big peak could be observed in each curve of various
PLA samples because of the addition of PLA and/or SAG. As the melting
time increased, the torque curve of pure PLA decreased gradually,
which should be resulted from the chain scission induced by thermal
degradation and hydrolyzation.28 Interestingly,
the torque curve of PLA–SAG4 increased with the melting time,
indicating that the ring-opening reaction occurred between PLA and
SAG. In order to observe the final torque values of various PLA samples
clearly, their torque curves in 600–900 s were enlarged and
placed in the upper left corner of Figure 1. It could be found that as the content of
SAG increased, the final torque values of various PLA samples rose
gradually, which should be attributed to the occurrence of chain extension
as well as the formation of branching and cross-linking structures.29 Similar phenomenon was observed in our previous
works.30 Based on the results of the torque
curve, it could be speculated that the viscosity of PLA–SAG
samples was enhanced with the increasing concentration of SAG.

2.2 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectra Analysis
The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) spectra of various PLA samples and SAG are represented in Figure 2. In Figure 2a, several characteristic peaks
of PLA could be seen in the FTIR spectra of various PLA samples, which
were the C=O stretching vibration peak at 1751 cm–1, the C–O vibration peak at 1183 cm–1, the
C–H deformation vibration peak at 1452 cm–1, and the methyl characteristic peak at 1361 cm–1, respectively.31,32 In Figure 2b, an obvious peak at 912 cm–1 assigning to the stretching vibration of the epoxy ring could be
seen in the FTIR spectrum of SAG.33,34 After the
melt-mixing
process of PLA and SAG, the peak of the epoxy ring at 912 cm–1 disappeared in the spectra of PLA–SAG samples and the characteristic
peak at 712 cm–1 associating with the bending vibration
of C–H out-of-plane of the benzene ring in SAG appeared in
the PLA–SAG samples (in Figure 2c), indicating the occurrence of chain extension reaction
between PLA and SAG.

Figure 2 FTIR spectra
of SAG and various PLA samples: (a) wavenumbers range from 3500 to
500 cm–1, (b) wavenumbers range from 1000 to 800
cm–1, and (c) wavenumbers range from 800 to 600
cm–1.

2.3 Gel Fraction
Gel fraction was usually
used to characterize
the cross-linking degree of polymers.35 Considered on the chemical reaction between PLA and SAG, the gel
fraction of various PLA samples is measured and summarized in Table 1. It could be seen
from Table 1 that the
gel fraction of various PLA samples increased gradually with the increment
in SAG contents, which would be helpful to improve the viscoelasticity
of PLA. The generation of gel indicated the occurrence of cross-linking
reaction between PLA and SAG.30 When the
content of SAG was 4 wt %, the gel content of PLA–SAG4 reached
13.18 ± 1.07%. The formation of excessive gel would have a negative
effect on the degradation of PLA. In fact, from the perspective of
molecular chain architecture, the PLA–SAG samples were the
mixtures of linear PLA, branching PLA, and/or cross-linking PLA.36

2.4 Crystallization and Melting Behaviors
The differential
scanning
calorimetry (DSC) curves of various PLA samples at the cooling (a)
and heating (b) rates of 10 °C/min are shown in Figure 3. The isothermal crystallization
curves of various PLA samples are shown in Figure 4a. The Avrami method was used to analyze
the crystallization kinetic, and the double-ln plots of isothermal
crystallization are displayed in Figure 4b. The corresponding thermal performance
parameters obtained from DSC curves, including glass transition temperature
(Tg), cold crystallization temperature
(Tcc), melting temperature (Tm), crystallization kinetic constant (k), half time (t(1/2)), crystallinity
(χc), are summarized in Table 2.

of Various PLA Samples
sample name	Tg (°C)	Tcc (°C)	Tm (°C)	K	t(1/2) (min)	χc (%)	
pure PLA	59.9 ± 0.1	119.0 ± 0.0	150.2 ± 0.3	 	 	1.2 ± 0.1

As shown in Table 2, with the increasing content
of SAG, the Tg of various PLA samples
was unchanged nearly,
indicating that the length of the chain segment in various PLA samples
changed hardly after chain extension. However, with the increment
in the SAG content, the Tcc of various
PLA samples increased and their Tm decreased,
slightly and respectively. The increment in the Tcc of various PLA samples was probably because the formation
of the branching structure in PLA–SAG samples restricted the
movement of PLA molecular chains.37 The
reduction in the Tm of various PLA samples
should be ascribed to the decreasing perfection degree of the crystalline
region in PLA by the formation of branching and/or cross-linking structures.
Compared with that of pure PLA, the χc of PLA–SAG
samples increased slightly, which may be due to two aspects. On one
hand, the branching points could be acted as the heterogeneous nucleation
sites for PLA crystallization. On the other hand, the movement of
molecular chains of PLA–SAG sample into the crystal lattice
was restricted by the existence of branching and/or cross-linking
structures.37 Based on the two following
considerations, the foaming temperature was selected between Tcc and Tm in this
research.38,39 One was that the high melt strength and
viscosity of various PLA samples could be obtained because of the
microcrystalline region acting the microcross-linking sites, which
could be helpful for restricting the cell coalescence and growth.39 The other was that numerous interfaces between
the crystalline region and amorphous region could be acted as the
heterogeneous nucleation sites for cell nucleation, which were beneficial
to increase cell density.38

In addition,
the k value and t(1/2) of various PLA samples isothermally crystallized at 120 °C
were measured to evaluate the crystallization rate and are shown in Table 2. Because the crystallization
peak could be not observed clearly in the isothermal DSC trace of
pure PLA as shown in Figure 4a, the k value and t(1/2) of the pure PLA sample could not be calculated in this
work. With the increasing SAG content, the k value of various PLA–SAG
samples increased remarkably from 3.7 × 10–5 to 1.4 × 10–3. In addition, the t(1/2) of the crystallization peak in DSC curves of various
PLA–SAG samples decreased largely from 36.9 ± 0.5 to 19.8
± 0.5 min, with the increment in the SAG content. This indicated
that the crystallization rate of PLA was enhanced by the chain extension,
which may be because the generated branching structure in CPLA could
be acted as the crystallization nucleation point, resulting in the
increment in the spherocrystal number (see Figure 5) and promoting the crystallization rate.

°C: (a) pure PLA, (b) PLA–SAG1, (c) PLA–SAG2, (d)

2.5 Polarized Optical Microscope
Observation
In order to further study the effect of SAG contents
on the crystal morphology of PLA, polarized optical microscopy (POM)
was used to study the number and size of spherocrystals in various
PLA samples. The crystal morphology of pure PLA is displayed in Figure 5a, in which a small
amount of large spherocrystals was observed. The clear interface between
the crystalline region and amorphous region indicated that the crystallization
of pure PLA was a typical homogeneous nucleation.38 The crystal morphology of CPLA (PLA–SAG) samples
is shown in Figure 5b–e. The spherocrystal number of various PLA–SAG samples
increased with the increasing content of SAG. This should be attributed
to the formation of branching structures which could be acted as the
points of crystallization nucleation to enhance the number of spherocrystals
after chain extension.38 The spherocrystal
size of various PLA–SAG samples decreased as the content of
SAG increased. The phenomenon could be explained by that the mobility
of PLA molecular chains was reduced by the formation of branching
structures, which would hinder PLA molecular chains moving into the
crystal lattice and limit spherocrystal growth.37 In summary, the generation of branching structure had double
effects on the crystallization of PLA. The formation of branching
structures in PLA–SAG samples was favorable for crystallization
nucleation and disadvantageous for crystallization growth, resulting
in the generation of a large number of small spherocrystals in PLA–SAG
samples.40

2.6 Intrinsic
Viscosity ([η]) Measurments
In general, the [η]
provided a measurement for the ability
of an isolated and Gaussian polymer single chain to increase the viscosity
of the solvent lacking of intermolecular interactions between polymer
molecules.41 The inherent viscosity (ηinher) of each PLA sample at different solution concentrations
is shown in Figure 6. There was a close relationship between the ηinher of polymer and the solution concentration. The [η] of polymer
could be determined by extrapolating the concentration of polymer
solution to zero.41 It could be seen in Table 3 that the [η]
of various PLA samples increased with the increasing content of SAG,
which should be attributed to the increment in the pervaded volume
of the PLA molecular chain induced by the formation of branching and/or
cross-linking structures. The branching degree of various PLA samples
is shown in Table 4. The branching degree of various PLA samples increased with the
increasing content of SAG, indicating the formation and increment
of branching and/or microcross-linking structures.30

2.7 Rheological
Properties
The viscoelastic properties of polymer melt were
generally tested by a dynamic rotational rheometer. The complex viscosity
(η*), storage modules (G′), and loss
factor (tan δ) of various PLA samples at different angular frequencies
(ω) are shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Dynamic
rheological properties of various PLA samples: (a) η*, (b) G′, (c) tan δ.

The η* of various PLA samples at different ω
is displayed in Figure 7a. A typical behavior of pseudoplastic fluid was observed that was
the shear thinning behaviors in the η* curves of various PLA
samples.42 At low ω, the η*
of various PLA samples increased with the increasing content of SAG,
which should be attributed to the formation of branching and/or cross-linking
structures.43 The branching structures
would help to increase the melt viscosity of PLA as well as avoid
cell mergence and rupture in the cell growth stage.

Figure 7b showed the G’ of various PLA samples at different ω. The G’′ of various PLA samples at low ω
enhanced as the content of SAG increased, indicating that the melt
elasticity of PLA was improved. In addition, with the SAG content
increasing, the slope of all the G’′
curves decreased. This phenomenon should be attributed to the formation
of the branching and/or microcross-linking structures after chain
extension.36 The increment in the melt
elasticity was conducive to improve the foamability of PLA–SAG
samples.36

The tan δ of various
PLA samples at different ω is shown in Figure 7c. The tan δ was defined as a ratio
of loss modulus and G’′ (i.e., viscous
to elastic contribution) at a given ω.44 It could be observed in Figure 6c that a big peak of mechanical loss appeared in the
tan δ curve of pure PLA and PLA–SAG1 at the ω of
1 and 0.1 rad/s, respectively. The tan δ of PLA–SAG2,
PLA–SAG3, and PLA–SAG4 decreased gradually with the
increasing ω. This indicated that their mechanical loss peak
corresponding to the ω should be lower than 0.1 rad/s. With
the increasing content of SAG, the tan δ of various PLA samples
decreased gradually at the entire measured ω range, indicating
that the elastic response of various PLA samples became fast, their
viscous dissipation decreased gradually, and thus their foamability
was enhanced. This phenomenon should be ascribed to the increment
in the number of entanglement points in PLA–SAG samples after
chain extension.44,45 Those entanglement points could
be acted as the physical network sites to enhance the melt elasticity
of PLA–SAG samples.

2.8 Cellular Morphology
Figures 8 and 9 show the cellular
morphology and cell size distribution of various PLA foams prepared
at 125 °C, respectively. Table 4 displays the foaming parameters of various PLA foams
such as the cell size, cell density, and VER. It could be observed
in Figure 7a that the
cell walls of pure PLA were ruptured, and its cellular structure was
incomplete, thus it was difficult to measure cell size and cell density.
This phenomenon should be because the low melt strength of pure PLA
was insufficient to support the cell growth, resulting in cell mergence
and rupture.25 The cellular morphology
of PLA foams became better after the chain extension because of the
improved melt strength of PLA–SAG samples by the generation
of branching and microcross-linking structures.46

(d) PLA–SAG3 foam, and (e) PLA–SAG4 foam.

of various PLA foams at the foaming temperature of 125 °C: (a)
PLA–SAG1 foam, (b) PLA–SAG2 foam, (c) PLA–SAG3
foam, and (d) PLA–SAG4 foam.

With the content of SAG increasing from 1 to 4 wt
%, the cell size of various PLA–SAG foams gradually decreased
from 364 ± 198 to 249 ± 100 nm, in which the cell size of
PLA–SAG4 foam was much smaller than that of the PLA foams prepared
in our previous studies.14,42 The reduction in the
cell size of various PLA–SAG foams should be resulted from
two aspects. On one hand, the crystalline region could not be biaxially
stretched during the foaming process, which limited the cell growth
to a certain extent.40 On the other hand,
the entanglements formed by branching and micro cross-linking structures
could be served as the cross-linking points to enhance the melt viscosity
of PLA and limit cell growth.2 The cell
size distribution of various PLA–SAG foams is shown in Figure 9. As the SAG content
increased from 1 to 4 wt %, the cell size distribution of various
PLA–SAG foams became narrow first and then kept unchanged.
The cell density of various PLA foams increased first and then decreased
slightly with the increasing content of SAG. The increment in cell
density should be originated from two reasons. One was that the interface
area between the crystalline region and amorphous region increased
because of the formation of a large number of small spherocrystals
(see Figure 5), which
could be acted as heterogeneous cell nucleation points to increase
cell density effectively.2,38,47 The other was that the improved melt elasticity of PLA–SAG
samples (see Figure 7b) reduced the cell mergence, helping to increase cell density.47 With the SAG content increasing from 3 to 4
wt %, the slight decrement in the cell density of PLA–SAG foams
should be attributed to the generation of a large amount of gel (see Table 1), restricting the
cell nucleation and growth. The unfoamed regions in PLA–SAG4
foam are marked by yellow arrows in Figure 8e. The VER of various PLA foams increased
gradually with the increasing content of SAG because of the increment
in the G’′ of various PLA samples (see Figure 7b).36

Figures 10 and 11 show the cellular morphology
and cell size distribution of PLA–SAG2 foams at different temperatures. Table 5 summarized the foaming
parameters of PLA–SAG2 foams prepared at different temperatures,
such as the cell size, cell density, and VER. As the foaming temperature
increased, the cell size and VER of PLA–SAG2 foams increased
as well as their cell density enhanced, gradually and remarkably.
This phenomenon should be attributed to the decreased melt viscosity
promoting the cell growth and mergence with the foaming temperature
increasing.48 When the foaming temperature
increased from 125 to 127 °C, an interesting transition from
nanocells to microcells could be observed in PLA–SAG2 foams.
Compared with the SAG content, foaming temperature had a significant
influence on the cellular morphology evolution of various PLA foams.

2.9 Thermal Conductivity
The thermal conductivity
of various PLA samples and their foams
is shown in Table 6. The thermal conductivity of pure PLA sample and its foam was 1.77
± 0.005 and 1.27 ± 0.006 W/(m·K), respectively. The
decrement in the thermal conductivity indicated that the thermal insulation
performance of pure PLA was greatly improved after foaming because
of the introduction of the cells and the lower thermal conductivity
of air. It could be seen from the thermal conductivity of various
PLA samples that chain extension had little effect on the thermal
conductivity of the unfoamed PLA samples but large effect on the thermal
conductivity of PLA foams due to the variation of foaming properties.
With the SAG content increasing from 0 to 4 wt %, the thermal conductivity
of various PLA foams decreased from 0.127 ± 0.006 to 0.080 ±
0.005 W/(m·K). This implied that the thermal insulation property
of PLA foams was improved after chain extension, which should be attributed
to the decrement in the cell size to the nanoscale (probably generating
Knudsen effect). Besides this, the decrement in the thermal conductivity
of various PLA foams looked to have a relationship with the reduction
in foam density.49,50

2.10 Foaming
Mechanism
In general, the formation
of nanocells in the polymer foams depended on two aspects. One was
the sufficient cell nucleation sites to promote cell nucleation, resulting
in the high cell density. The other was the favorable melt viscoelasticity
to restrict the cell growth and avoid the cell mergence, leading to
the expected small cell size.

In this work, an isothermal crystallization-induced
method was proposed to produce numerous and small spherocrystals in
various PLA samples, which were helpful for generating nanocells.
As displayed in Figure 12, with the SAG content increasing, the molecular chain architecture
of various PLA samples would change from linear to branching and/or
cross-linking structures (see Tables 1 and 3). Because of the nucleation
effect of branching points and the restricted movement of PLA molecular
chains by the formation of branching and/or cross-linking structures,
the spherocrystal number of various PLA samples increased and their
size decreased, indicating that the interface area between the crystalline
region and amorphous region enhanced. Because the interface between
the crystalline region and amorphous region could be acted as the
cell nucleation sites,2,48 the cell density of various PLA
foams was promoted significantly. Besides this, the formed numerous
and small spherocrystals would decrease the solubility and diffusion
of CO2 in PLA matrix and could be served as physical cross-linking
sites to enhance the melt viscoelasticity.40 Both the two aspects would limit the cell growth and mergence, which
were beneficial to generate the cell size in nanometer and increase
the cell density significantly.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, nanocellular
PLA
foams were fabricated successfully by an isothermal crystallization
induction method in the presence of supercritical CO2.
The crystallization behaviors and rheological properties of various
PLA samples were improved by the chain extension reaction using SAG
as CE. The results of gel content and [η] showed that the branching
and micro cross-linking structures were generated in PLA–SAG
samples. POM images displayed that the spherocrystal number of various
PLA samples increased and their size decreased, with the increasing
content of SAG.

As the content of SAG increased from 1 to 4
wt %, the cell size of various PLA foams decreased gradually and the
smallest cell size could reach 249 ± 100 nm. With the foaming
temperature increasing from 125 to 127 °C, an interesting transition
from nanocells to microcells was observed in PLA–SAG2 foams.
The chain extension was positive to enhance the thermal insulation
performance of various PLA foams by decreasing their foam density.
This study may provide a feasible method for the fabrication of nanocells
in other semicrystalline polymers.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
PLA (2003 D) was purchased
from
Nature Works Inc. It has the melt flow rate of 3.2 g/10 min (190 °C,
2.16 kg), the d-isomer content of approximately 4.3%, the
density of 1.24 g/cm3, the glass transition and melting
temperature of 61.4 and 147.6 °C, respectively. SAG (its product
grade: SAG-008) is a random SAG terpolymer with the epoxy content
of 8 ± 0.5 wt %, which was supplied by Fine-Blend Compatibilizer
Jiangsu Co., China.

4.2 Preparation of Various
PLA Samples
Prior to melt blending,
PLA and SAG were dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 6 h to remove
moisture and eliminate the influence of moisture on the experiment.
The melting temperature, mixing time, and mixing speed were 180 °C,
15 min, and 80 rpm, respectively. According to the formula shown in Table 7, PLA and SAG with
various blending ratios were fed into a Haake internal mixer. The
corresponding sample names were denoted as pure PLA, PLA–SAG1,
PLA–SAG2, PLA–SAG3, and PLA–SAG4, respectively.
Subsequently, the resultant samples were placed and pressed in a mold
at 190 °C and 10 MPa for 10 min and then cooled to room temperature
to form sheet samples with the thickness of 1 mm. According to the
preparation method mentioned above, at least five samples in each
category of various PLA samples were produced. Finally, the small
sheet with 1 cm × 1 cm (length × width) was cut in the center
of each sample for further characterization and foaming process.

PLA Samples

SAG (wt %)	0	1	2	3	4	
4.3 Foaming Process of
Various PLA Samples
Various PLA samples were foamed in a
stainless-steel autoclave using supercritical CO2 as a
physical foaming agent. The schematic diagram of the autoclave for
batch foaming was introduced in detail in our previous study.51 First, the PLA samples were placed into an autoclave
for 2 h at the saturation pressure of 10 MPa and the constant foaming
temperature of 123, 125, 127, and 129 °C, respectively. After
the CO2 was completely diffused and dissolved in the PLA
matrix, the pressure of the autoclave was dropped by releasing CO2 from 10 to 0.1 MPa in about 6 s, providing a driving force
for cell nucleation and growth to produce various PLA foams.

4.4 Characterizations
4.4.1 Fourier Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of various PLA samples were
measured at the room temperature using a Nicolet IZ10 spectrometer.
Various PLA samples were placed on the sample stand and measured with
32 scans at a resolution of 2 cm–1. Each spectrum
was recorded within the range of 3500–500 cm–1.

4.4.2 Gel Fraction
Measurement
The gel fraction of various PLA samples was tested
by Soxhlet extraction with chloroform until the weight did not vary
anymore. Then, various PLA samples were dried in an oven for 6 h at
80 °C. The gel fraction of various PLA samples could be calculated
by eq 1 1  in which, w0 and wg are the original weight
of various PLA samples and the weight of dried insoluble part in various
PLA samples, respectively.

4.4.3 Differential Scanning
Calorimetry
The crystallization
and melting behaviors of various PLA samples were studied by DSC (Q20,
TA, USA).52 Approximated 5–10 mg
of each PLA sample was quickly heated to 190 °C, hold for 5 min
to eliminate the heat history, and then decreased to 40 °C by
the cooling rate of 10 °C/min, finally reheated to 190 °C
by the heating rate of 10 °C/min. The χc of
various PLA samples was computed by eq 2.53 2  

In which, ΔHm(PLA) is the melting enthalpy of PLA, ΔHcc(PLA) is the cold crystallization enthalpy
of PLA, and ΔHm(PLA)0 is the melting enthalpy of 100% crystalline
PLA that is 93 J/g.54

In order to
evaluate the crystallization rate of various PLA samples, PLA samples
were heated from room temperature to 200 °C at the rate of 30
°C/min, held for 5 min to eliminate thermal history, then cooled
down 120 °C at the rate of 30 °C/min, and kept for 180 min
to obtain the isothermal DSC curves. The t(1/2) of various PLA samples in isothermal DSC curves and their k value calculated from the Avrami equation were used to
determine the crystallization rate.51

4.4.4 Polarized Optical
Microscopy
POM (BX-51, Olympus, Japan) was employed to observe
the crystal morphology of various PLA samples. The PLA samples were
heated from room temperature to 200 °C at the rate of 30 °C/min,
held for 5 min to eliminate thermal history, then cooled down 120
°C at the rate of 30 °C/min, and kept for 40 min to observe
their crystal morphology changes.

4.4.5 [η]
The [η] of various PLA
samples was measured by an Ubbelohde viscometer. To keep the temperature
constant in the entire test, the viscometer was immersed in a thermostatic
water bath at 25 °C. Each PLA sample was dissolved in chloroform,
forming five different concentrations and placed into a volumetric
flask of 25 mL. The flowing time measurements for each concentration
were repeated five times and then averaged to ensure the result accuracy.
Finally, the [η] and branching degree of various PLA samples
were calculated by the equations reported in the literature.55

4.4.6 Rheological Properties
The dynamic rheological properties
of various PLA samples were tested using a rotational rheometer (ARES
Rheometer, TA, USA) at 190 °C with a pair of parallel plates
(20 mm in diameter with a gap of 1.0 mm). The frequency range was
0.1–100 rad/s, and the maximum strain was fixed at 5% to make
sure that these conditions were within the linear viscoelastic region
under nitrogen. The η*, storage modules G’, and tan δ were measured at various angular frequencies.

4.4.7 Scanning Electron
Microscope
The cellular morphology of various PLA foams was
observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV. Each PLA foam was immersed in liquid nitrogen for
4 h and then fractured quickly in air. Prior to observation, the fracture
surfaces of various PLA foams were sputter-coated with Au to prevent
accumulation of static charge during observation.56

4.4.8 Foaming
Properties
The VER (ϕ) of various PLA foams was calculated
by eq 3 3  where
ρf and ρp are the bulk densities
of the prefoam and postfoam samples in g/cm3, respectively,
which were measured by a density balance (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany).

Cell density (N0) (cells/cm3) was analyzed using the software image tool and calculated by eq 4 4  where n is the number of cells in the SEM micrograph, M is the magnification factor, and A is
the area of the micrograph (in cm2).

4.4.9 Thermal Insulation Performance
A laser thermal conductivity
analyzer (LFA467, NETZSCH Scientific
Instruments Co., Ltd, GER) was used to measure the thermal conductivity
of various PLA samples and their foams at 25 °C. The prepared
samples with the thickness of 1 mm were cut into the small sheet with
10 mm × 10 mm (length × width) as well as their surface
was kept parallel. Each sample was measured five times, and the average
value was recorded.
