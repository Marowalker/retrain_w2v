In the present study,
the correlation
between surface chemical groups and the electrostatic properties of
particulate materials was studied. Glass beads were modified to produce
OH-, NH2-, CN-, and F-functionalized materials. The materials
were charged separately both by friction and by conventional corona
charging, and the results were compared. The results obtained from
both methods indicated that the electrostatic properties are directly
related to the surface functional group chemistry, with hydrophobic
groups accumulating greater quantities of charge than hydrophilic
groups. The fluorine-rich surface accumulated 5.89 times greater charge
upon tribocharging with stainless steel than the hydroxyl-rich surface.
However, in contrast to the tribocharging method, the charge polarity
could not be determined when corona charging was used. Moreover, discharge
profiles at different humidity levels (25% RH, 50% RH, and 75% RH)
were obtained for each modified surface, which showed that higher
humidity facilitates faster charge decay; however, this enhancement
is surface chemistry-dependent. By increasing the humidity from 25%
RH to 75% RH, the charge relaxation times can be accelerated 1.6 times
for fluorine and 12.2 times for the cyano group. These data confirm
that surface functional groups may dictate powder electrostatic behavior
and account for observed charge accumulation and discharge phenomena.

1 Introduction
Accumulation
of electrostatic charge is frequently
observed during powder processing and handling. Operations such as
mixing, milling, and conveying involve the movement of the powder
against surfaces and therefore can lead to charging via friction,
commonly known as tribocharging.1−3 The industrial significance and
the importance of the phenomenon
itself tends to be underestimated; however, operational problems and
safety concerns regarding uncontrolled charge build-up have been identified.2,4 Problems with charged materials are particularly applicable to pharmaceutical
powders, as these tend to be organic materials and are thus common
insulators. Such materials not only easily acquire static charge but
also can retain the charge for prolonged lengths of time because of
slow charge decay rates.5 Besides processes
where charge build-up is undesirable and should be minimized, controlled
charging can be beneficial, for example, during electrostatic separation
and in the coating industry.6,7 Even though tribocharging
has been recorded since the times of Ancient Greece,8 the scientific theories and principles behind it are still
very poorly understood.9

The complexity
of powder electrostatics arises from a number of factors that may
influence the process of charge generation and charge dissipation.
These factors can be divided into three main categories: inherent
physico-chemical properties of the powder and contacting surface,
interfacial mechanics of the interaction between the particulate material
and contacting surfaces, and external environmental conditions.5,10 Consequently, variable and nonstandard experimental conditions and
methods reported in studies on powder electrostatics make direct comparisons
of experimental results difficult, and as a result, no general database
of the chargeability of dry powders currently exists.11−13

Triboelectrification tends
to be considered as a surface phenomenon and therefore can be influenced
by external parameters such as temperature and relative humidity.12 Typically, higher moisture content in the surrounding
environment results in a reduction in the absolute charge generated
during the tribocharging process.14,15 However, Elajnaf
et al. concluded that this general trend can be further affected by
the nature of the contacting surface, as differing extents of charge
reduction were observed when the same powder interacted with metal
or plastic surfaces.14 The overall reduction
in charge by moisture is associated with lowering surface resistivity
because of water molecules adsorbing on the surface. Specifically,
the existence and adsorption of [OH(H2O)n]− and [H(H2O)n]+ ions on the surface have been identified to contribute
toward charge reduction.16,17 In some cases, preferential
deposition of either type of ion, depending on the surface type, has
been observed.18 In this way, an additional
discharge pathway is created compared with the same material under
dry conditions.9,19 This could also potentially affect
the charge relaxation times; however, no such data have been provided
by Elajnaf et al.15 Furthermore, there
is evidence that humidity itself can impart electrostatic charge on
the isolated surfaces,20 which indicates
an important role of water as “a source and sink of ions”18 in the surface electrostatic phenomenon.21,22

The interaction of moisture with surfaces is directly related
to surface hydrophobicity and as such can also influence the electrostatic
properties of materials. In their study, Jallo and Dave examined the
effect of silica and titania coatings on acetaminophen particles and
concluded that a sample with hydrophilic silica coating charged less
compared with a hydrophobic one.23 Even
though the comparison was made between two types of coatings only
and additional parameters such as changes in surface area and roughness
because of nanoparticle deposition were not taken into account, the
findings emphasize that surface composition and therefore properties
such as hydrophobicity and surface energy play a crucial role in explaining
the electrostatic properties of powder surfaces. Similarly, in the
study conducted by Gouveia et al. (2012), the surface acid/base properties
of various materials were linked to the adsorption/desorption of OH– and H+ ions upon changes in humidity, which
provides an indication of the relationship between the surface properties
and its chargeability.24

In addition,
most physical properties such as particle size, shape, surface roughness,
and purity are known to affect the electrostatic properties of materials.13,25,26 Hence, in total, considering
the wide range of parameters associated with powders only, a rather
complex picture of powder electrostatics is created, which makes it
difficult to study one parameter at a time. Therefore, the dominant
parameters governing the charging of powders are still not well understood.

In this study, the emphasis is placed on investigating the parameters
associated with powder surfaces only, and, apart from humidity, all
other factors such as surfaces in contact and mechanics of interaction,
are kept constant. There are several publications27−30 covering these
aspects in detail and reviews on other factors affecting powder electrostatics
in general.9,12,31,32

Therefore, in terms of powder properties
the
objective of this study is to evaluate the influence of surface chemistry,
as a single variable, on the propensity for particulate materials
to acquire and dissipate electrostatic charge. The main hypothesis
to be tested is that the functional groups present at the contact
surfaces of particles, and therefore the surface composition, can
be considered to be one of the dominant factors in determining powder
electrostatic properties. It has been previously shown that the composition
of the tribocharging surface can affect the charging of a powder;33 however, to the best of our knowledge, no such
relationship has been determined for the reverse scenario. In addition,
as surface chemistry determines properties such as the degree of hydrophobicity,
it is reasonable to expect a change in electrostatic properties when
the surfaces are exposed to differing humidity conditions. These could
potentially influence not only the maximum charge accumulated, as
shown by Elajnaf et al.,15 but also changes
in the charge relaxation behavior. The main aim of the experimental
design is to prepare and study the materials in such a way that only
the surface functionality is changed exclusively across the samples
studied while all other factors are kept the same to allow direct
comparison with the electrostatic behavior. The results obtained from
tribocharging experiments are compared and contrasted with the results
where a more conventional corona discharge was used to charge the
materials to determine the capability of the two methods to provide
information on particle electrostatics.

2 Results
and Discussion
The aim of this study
is to limit the number of variables that could lead to inconsistent
results when measuring the electrostatic properties of the particulate
system. The use of spherical glass beads as a model material ensured
that the size, morphology, and surface area were kept constant and
that only the surface chemistry modifications resulted in changes
to the electrostatic properties of the samples.

This section
is divided into two parts. First, the functionalization of particles
is discussed in section 2.1, followed by the results of the electrostatic measurements
(section 2.2), with
maximum charging abilities being covered in section 2.2.1 and charge decay profiles being presented
in section 2.2.2.

2.1 Surface Modification
The surface chemistry
of the glass beads was modified via a series
of silanization reactions. The general reaction involves substitution
and condensation reactions, as schematically depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
silanization reaction.34

Three different
silane solutions were used to produce fluoro-functionalized glass
beads (GB-F), cyano-functionalized glass beads (GB-CN), and amino-functionalized
glass beads (GB-NH2). In addition, cleaned unmodified glass
beads with hydroxyl groups (GB-OH) were studied.

The wetting
behavior of all samples was characterized using contact angle measurements
to assess whether the surfaces were chemically modified. The measurements
also provide information on the degree of surface hydrophobicity achieved.
The results obtained for each surface are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Equilibrium
Contact
Angle of Probe Liquid Water on Studied Surfaces (n = 5, Mean ± SD)
sample	contact angle (deg)	
GB-OH	28.3 ± 0.8	
GB-NH2	63.3 ± 6.6	
GB-CN	87.8 ± 6.4	
GB-F	115.7 ± 4.0	
The values in Table 1 are characteristic
of the surface chemistries induced as a result of silanization35,36 and indicate that the glass bead surfaces have been successfully
functionalized. Although the data reported here could be affected
by surface roughness of the prepared slides, the data spread is reasonable
to prove that distinct surface chemistries were prepared. Based on
the contact angle data, the samples can be ranked in the order of
increasing hydrophobicity  

2.2 Characterization
of Electrostatic Behavior
2.2.1 Ability to Accumulate
Electrostatic Charge
2.2.1.1 Charge Accumulation
by
Tribocharging
To assess the tribocharging behavior of each
sample, the maximum electrostatic potential (Vmax) of each set of glass beads in contact with stainless steel
was measured, as described in section 4.4.1. The method adopted here represents
rather mild conditions for powder triboelectrification compared with
more intensive industrial processes, such as conveying, that are characterized
by much higher powder loadings and velocities. The maximum charge
provides an indication of the ability of the powder to become electrostatically
charged under applied tribocharging conditions. Figure 2 shows the maximum surface potential detected
normalized with respect to the sample mass m (Vmax/m), for each sample.

Figure 2 Maximum potential
acquired by functionalized
surfaces
tribocharged by a stainless steel surface (25 °C, 20% RH; n = 6–10, mean ± SD).

As shown in Figure 2, each sample accumulated a distinct level of charge under
the same
conditions. The GB-OH sample acquired the overall surface potential
of −1.9 ± 0.3 V/mg, followed by GB-NH2 and
GB-CN, which acquired potentials equal to +2.1 ± 0.3 and −2.6
± 0.5 V/mg, respectively. Out of the four surface functionalizations
studied, the GB-F sample acquired the largest potential of −11.2
± 2.8 V/mg. Therefore, the surfaces can be ranked in the order
of increasing ability to accumulate charge, excluding polarity as
follows  

This order correlates very well with
the order of hydrophobicity
determined by the contact angle measurement and indicates that as
the surface becomes more hydrophobic, it can accumulate a greater
charge. A similar relationship between charge magnitude and hydrophobicity
of two different silica coatings was reported by Jallo and Dave.23

The surfaces studied accumulate predominantly
negative charge as a result of contact with stainless steel. Such
behavior is typically expected when organic materials come in contact
with metal surfaces, as the latter are believed to contain a large
number of free electrons susceptible for donation. However, the two
nitrogen functionalities, that is, amino and cyano, acquired positive
and negative charges, respectively. The preference of the amino surface
for positive charging cannot be explained on the basis of hydrophobicity.

However, amines are Brönsted bases, which means they can
accept a proton; alternatively, they can be described as Lewis bases,
which means they are electron donors. This theory supports the observed
results well, where amino-functionalized particles give up electrons
and become positively charged in contact with stainless steel surfaces.
Even though the nitrogen in the cyano group also possesses a lone
pair, the sp orbital hybridization provides it 50% s character and
hence the electron density is held closer to the nucleus. Therefore,
its basicity is significantly reduced.37 This can be further illustrated using pKa values of conjugated acids for common organic molecules, where the
higher value of pKa indicates a stronger
base and hence a better electron donor. Typical values of pKa for alkyl amines are 9–10, whereas
the simple nitrile group has a pKa of
−10.37

A similar behavior
in polarity preference was previously observed for polymers, where
positive surface charges were attributed to the dominating Lewis base
character of the materials studied.38 This
seems to be in agreement with the common triboelectric series that
ranks amine-containing nylon above stainless steel, which means that
it charges positively in contact with the stainless steel surface.39,40 The order of the triboelectric series can usually be predicted based
on the work functions of conductive materials associated with the
Fermi levels of the electrons. However, if insulators are involved
in contact charging, their order in the triboelectric series tends
to be determined based on the theoretically calculated apparent work
function for an insulator and confirmed experimentally.9,40 In addition, it has been shown that the sites with a strong base
character tend to accumulate H+ ions from the atmosphere
in preference to OH– ions, which further supports
the charge polarity observations made.24

2.2.1.2 Charge
Accumulation by Corona Charging
Measurements were recorded
using corona discharge, as outlined in section 4.4.2, to determine the maximum charge acquired
by the samples. Corona discharge has been used extensively as a method
for assessing the electrostatic properties of various materials ranging
from thin films41,42 and fibers43 to polymers44,45 and powders,46 and the technique is believed to provide results comparable
with tribocharging experiments.11

The results obtained when a negative corona discharge was applied
to the modified glass bead samples are shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Maximum potential
acquired
by functionalized surfaces charged by corona discharge (25 °C,
25% RH; n = 4, mean ± SD).

The four samples tested show a relatively
strong charge accumulation and confirmed the same trend observed in
the tribocharging measurements—the more hydrophobic the surface,
the higher the acquired charge. A linear relationship between the
maximum potential and surface hydrophobicity was obtained for both
the negative and the positive corona discharge data (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Maximum potential
acquired
by functionalized surfaces upon corona discharge as a function of
surface contact angle (25 °C, 25% RH n = 4,
mean ± SD).

In contrast to the
data obtained using the tribocharging method (Figure 2), there is no clear preference of the amino-functionalized
surface for the positive charge accumulated because of the positive
corona deposition. The same linear trend is obtained across the samples
irrespective of the corona polarity. This indicates that the ability
of the surface studied to acquire charge could be primarily governed
by surface hydrophobicity; however, this could be further altered
by the nature of the contacting surface and its work function, with
the latter being assessed using tribocharging methods only.

Furthermore, the results obtained from the tribocharging measurements
(Figure 2) show that
the fluorinated sample acquires an approximately six times greater
charge compared with the other three samples. This difference could
be because fluorine is the most electronegative element, with an electronegativity
of 4.0 on the Pauling scale, which means that it has very high affinity
toward free electrons, when they are available. A similar conclusion
was made by Kwok et al., who studied charging properties of two fluorine-containing
metered dose inhaler propellants. Their negative charge was attributed
to the electronegativity of the fluorine atoms present.47

Such a strong preference for accumulation
of the negative charge was not observed based on corona charging measurements
under the same conditions. This implies that the strong affinity to
electrons could be only a result of the interaction with the contacting
surface. However, it is also important to highlight that under an
applied corona discharge of 8 kV, the surfaces become saturated with
charge, which would not be the case for the mild tribocharging conditions
studied here.

The ability of the surface to acquire charge was
tested as the humidity increased to 50% RH and then finally to 75%
RH. As shown in Figure 5, in contrast to other samples, the tendency for GB-F to accumulate
a large negative charge is still strongly pronounced and does not
seem to be affected by the substantial increase in the humidity. In
all other samples, a significant charge reduction was observed as
a result of moisture present in the environment.

Figure 5 Maximum potential acquired
by functionalized
surfaces
upon corona discharge as a function of humidity (n = 4, mean ± SD).

These observations
imply that the charge initially accumulated by the surface could be
strongly affected by the moisture present on the surface because of
environmental conditions. Hydrophilic surfaces interact with the moisture
easily, and as humidity increases, more water molecules are expected
to deposit on the surfaces, which increases the overall conductivity.
However, in the fluorine surface, because of its strong hydrophobic
character, the levels of surface moisture might not be affected by
the increased humidity, and therefore, the initial charging is not
affected either.

The above observations highlight the importance
of functional groups present on the surface of powders. These results
could potentially be used to account for substantial differences in
the charging behavior observed between active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs) and excipients, where APIs tend to acquire considerably higher
charges compared with excipients.5 Most
of the common excipients, such as lactose monohydrate, mannitol, cellulose,
or corn starch, possess hydroxyl groups on the surface and do not
experience significant charge accumulation. By contrast, APIs may
be more electrically resistive, which makes them more prone to acquiring
charge. They may also possess a larger variety of elements, including
halogens containing functionalities such as in fluticasone propionate,
flurbiprofen, or aripiprazole;5,48 nitrogen atoms in theophylline,
salmeterol xinafoate, and paracetamol; or sulfur in diltiazem, which
may make them more susceptible to charge accumulation. This ability
of acquiring large charges could be potentially magnified even further
when coupled with typically small particle sizes of APIs, as these
tend to accept greater charges compared with large particles.1

Overall, the surface chemistry may strongly
affect the magnitude and polarity of charge acquired in contact with
surfaces. In addition to the ability of powders to become electrostatically
charged, it is important to determine how quickly the charge can be
dissipated as this will affect the powder performance, with slow charge
decay rates resulting in powder handling and processing issues.

2.2.2 Influence
of Relative Humidity on Electrostatic Charge Decay Rate
To
determine the effect of surface chemistry on charge decay kinetics,
charge decay curves were recorded for each sample at three different
humidity levels using both tribocharging and corona charging methods. Figure 6 depicts the half-life
time (t1/2) for all samples studied using
the tribocharging method, whereas Figure 7 shows the time required (t1/e) for the charge to decrease to 36.7%
of its initial level, for the same samples tested with a corona discharge.
These data quantify how quickly surfaces lose charge when subjected
to each respective charging method.

Figure 6 Charge decay of functionalized
surfaces at different
humidity levels as a result of tribocharging by a stainless steel
surface (n = 6, mean ± SD).

Figure 7 Charge decay
of functionalized
surfaces at different humidity levels as a result of negative corona
discharge (n = 4, mean ± SD).

In general, an increase
in relative humidity resulted in a decrease in the charge relaxation
times for all of the samples tested using both tribocharging and corona
discharge methods. This general observation agrees with previously
published data on the effect of humidity on charge decay kinetics.15

However, Figures 6 and 7 also show that
the effect of humidity on charge decay rate is different for different
surface chemistries. At lower humidity, a larger discrepancy between
the decay times for each surface was observed. As the humidity level
increased to 75% RH, these differences became smaller; that is, the
charge decay times for different surfaces became more similar and
therefore the surface chemistry itself became less pronounced. This
trend is observed for three out of four surfaces studied, with the
fluorine surface being an exception. The fluorine surface seems to
be affected by the moisture to a much smaller extent compared with
the other surface. However, considering that no effect of moisture
was observed for the initial charge of GB-F (Figure 5), this suggests that charge relaxation properties
could not only be dependent on the existing surface moisture but also
be a function of the interaction with water and ions present in the
surrounding environment. Surface charge relaxation via recombination
with ions in air has been previously suggested as a possible route
of charge decay.49 Furthermore, a tendency
of hydrophobic surfaces toward the adsorption of OH– ions has been previously reported.18 This
would imply that along with static charge dissipation, negative charge
is being accumulated on the surface because of the moisture present
effectively, which reduces the overall charge relaxation process.

An example discussed above proves that the total effect of humidity
on the charge decay kinetics is surface-dependent. As the humidity
increases from 25% RH to 75% RH, the time required for the charge
to dissipate to 36.7% for the fluorine surface is improved by 1.6
times. Conversely, the cyano surface discharges 12.2 times faster
under high-humidity conditions compared with the low-humidity conditions.
This shows that although the general trend is valid for all of the
surfaces, the overall effect is dependent on surface functionalization
(Figure 7).

Finally,
the results obtained using two methods (Figures 6 and 7) show that
the discharge times vary significantly depending on the discharge
route available. Much shorter times are observed (Figure 7) when a conductive pathway
is provided; hence, utilizing conductive, grounded surfaces could
be beneficial for improving the charge relaxation of highly chargeable
powders. When a nonconductive pathway is provided, charge dissipates
via air recombination only and hence the decay times observed (Figure 6) are significantly
longer. This indicates that powders confined under insulating conditions,
for example, in plastic containers, could remain charged for longer
periods of time, potentially affecting their bulk structure, handling,
and processability.

3 Conclusion
The present study demonstrates that surface chemistry may
play
a crucial role in determining the electrostatic properties of powders.
Silanization reactions performed on glass beads resulted in chemically
distinct surfaces with differing hydrophobicities without altering
physical properties such as the size, surface area, and surface roughness
of the particles. Consequently, a direct comparison of the impact
of chemical functional groups on the electrostatic properties of surfaces
was possible, with the polarity of the charge generated dependent
on the electronic structure or electronegativity. An increase in surface
hydrophobicity resulted in greater charge retention and, effectively,
larger quantities of charge being accumulated during both triboelectrification
and corona charging experiments with charge decay kinetics being strongly
dependent on the surface chemistry and its interaction with the moisture
present in the external environment. Finally, a comparison of data
generated by the two methods demonstrated that corona charging experiments
may provide a useful indication of the triboelectric charging behavior
of a material in terms of the magnitude of charge build-up and charge
decay kinetics, but not necessarily the polarity of the charge generated,
which is also dependent on the difference in the effective work functions
of the two interacting surfaces.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Glass beads (150–210
μm) were
purchased from Polysciences Europe GmbH, Eppelheim, and used as a
model particulate system. Absolute ethanol (AnalaR NORMAPUR ACS) obtained
from VWR West Sussex, UK, and deionized water (DI) were used for cleaning
purposes. Concentrated 15.7 M nitric acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset,
UK); toluene (AnalaR NORMAPUR ACS) from VWR West Sussex, UK; trimethoxy(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane
(≥97.0%, Aldrich); 3-cyanopropyltriethoxysilane (≥98.0%,
Aldrich); and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (≥99.0%, Aldrich)
were used as received for silanization reactions.

4.2 Surface Chemistry Modification
The glass beads were
cleaned using DI water, ethanol, and again
DI water followed by drying and then placing them in concentrated
nitric acid at 65 °C for 5 h. The beads were then filtered, washed
with DI water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C and 800 mbars
for at least 4 h. The surface chemistry of the cleaned beads was then
modified by placing the beads in toluene, stirring at room temperature
for 10 min followed by the addition of a selected silane to yield
1% (v/v) silane solution in toluene. The reaction flask was heated
to 100 °C under reflux and stirred overnight. After the time
elapsed, the beads were filtered, rinsed first with toluene to remove
any unreacted silane and then with ethanol. The beads were dried in
a vacuum oven at 60 °C for a minimum of 4 h.

4.3 Contact Angle Measurements
Prepared glass beads were
adhered to a glass microscope slide using
a double-sided tape to form a glass bead monolayer. Static sessile
drop measurements to determine the contact angle were taken with water
as a probe liquid using an EasyDrop contact angle measuring instrument
(Krüss GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). Five replicates were performed
for each sample, under ambient conditions. The same procedure was
used to measure the contact angle of the glass slide and the adhesive
tape for reference.

4.4 Electrostatic Measurements
4.4.1 Tribocharging Measurements
Triboelectrification of
glass beads was measured using a capacitive probe method as reported
previously.50 Briefly, glass beads were
stored in a conductive-grounded container under controlled environmental
conditions (25 °C, 30–35% RH) for a minimum of 18 h before
measurement. A U-shaped stainless steel spatula was used to charge
and load particles into the measuring pan, as illustrated in Figure 8. The spatula was
tilted at an angle of approximately 45°, placed directly above
the measuring pan, and between 10 and 30 mg of the sample was loaded
at a time. Charge decay was measured at 25 °C and three different
humidity levels: 20% RH, 50% RH, and 75% RH. The mass of sample used
was recorded. At least six repeats were performed for each sample
under each selected condition.

Figure 8 Schematic of
the tribocharging method used.

4.4.2 Corona Discharge Measurements
Glass
beads
were characterized for electrostatic properties using a charge decay
time analyzer (JCI155 v6, Chilworth Technology Ltd. Southampton, UK).
Samples were equilibrated under target conditions for a minimum of
18 h before measurement. Glass beads (2 g) were placed in the sample
holder to form an even layer. Both a negative and a positive corona
discharge of 8.0 kV were applied separately to the sample for a duration
of 0.02 s. The data analysis was commenced at 0.07 s after the corona
discharge, and the rate of charge decay was measured until 10% of
the initial charge was reached. Four measurements were taken for each
sample at 25 °C and three different humidity levels—25%
RH, 50% RH, and 75% RH—in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
cabinet (Safetech, Climatezone, Hampshire, UK).
