Two
novel polyesterurethane materials, PEU1 and PEU2, were synthesized via nontoxic and isocyanate-free route
by simple conversion of two epoxides 1,2-epoxy-3-phenoxy propane (2) and styrene epoxide (3) utilizing CO2. Epoxides 2 and 3 were converted to the
respective cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 by
a new set of cobalt-based catalyst 1a in the presence
of 10 bar of CO2 and 80 °C temperature without using
cocatalyst tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB). The mechanistic pathway
of the catalysis reaction for the cycloaddition of epoxides with CO2 to generate the cyclic carbonates was investigated by several
spectroscopic techniques and utilizing analogous zinc-based 1D coordination
polymer 1b, which does not act as an efficient catalyst
in the absence of TBAB. Cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 were converted to the respective polyesterurethanes PEU1 and PEU2 sequentially by first synthesizing
the ring-opened diols 6 and 7 reacting with
ethylenediamine and subsequently annealing the respective diols 6 and 7 at 120 °C in the presence of terepthalyl
chloride and triethylamine. The polyesterurethanes PEU1 and PEU2 were characterized by multinuclear NMR and
FTIR. PEU1 was also characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
The thermal studies of PEU1 and PEU2 showed
the stability up to 200–270 °C. The number-average and
weight-average molecular weights were determined for PEU1 and PEU2 by GPC analysis. The weight-average molecular
weight for PEU1 was found to be 5948 with a polydispersity
of 1.1, and PEU2 showed the weight-average molecular
weight as 4224 with a polydispersity of 1.06.

Introduction
Polyurethanes1−5 are known to be very promising materials widely used in home furnishing,
coatings, etc. Apart from wide spread application of polyurethanes,
the modified polyurethanes known as polyhydroxyurethanes6−10 and polyesterurethanes11−13 are becoming increasingly demanding
materials because of their application for building smart biodegradable
materials including materials for tissue engineering in biomedical
science.12,14−17 Most of the cases, the synthesis
of polyesterurethane involves the toxic disocyanates,18 and an isocyanate-free synthetic route for the polyesterurethanes
is rare.11 Here, we report a green method
for the synthesis of novel polyesterurethane materials, PEU1 and PEU2, from cyclic carbonates (4 and 5), ethylenediamine, and terepthalyl chloride. Although there
is a report of green synthesis of the polyesterurethane material,11 but the involvement of cyclic carbonates incorporating
the phenyl substituent is not known. Synthesis of polyesterurethane
materials involving the phenyl-containing cyclic carbonates could
bring additional properties including the thermal stability of the
resulting polyesterurethanes. The global warming and climate change
have caused alarming impacts on earth’s environment, and the
major cause of the global warming is happened to be the uncontrolled
increase of level of CO2 in earth’s atmosphere,
which has crossed 405 ppm in the present decade. Several methods have
been developed to reduce the level of CO2 in the atmosphere,19−22 among which the catalytic conversion of CO2 and epoxides
to produce cyclic carbonates has been one of the major routes to convert
CO2 into chemical feedstock.23,24,33,34,25−32 In order to synthesize the cyclic carbonates, the majority of catalysts
include a Lewis acidic metal center for the binding of the epoxide
and a subsequent nitrogen base, which activates the CO2 for insertion into the metal–oxygen bond.35,36 Tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) has been widely used as the cocatalysts
for the conversion of CO2 and epoxides to cyclic carbonates.37,38 TBAB plays a dual role in the catalytic cycle39 where it provides the bromide anions for the ring opening
of the epoxide and produces tetrabutyl amine for converting CO2 into carbamate, which subsequently inserts into the metal–oxygen
bond. Herein, we report two novel one-dimensional coordination polymers 1a and 1b as catalysts for the conversion of
CO2 and respective epoxides 1,2-epoxy-2-phenoxy propane
(2) and styrene epoxide (3) to corresponding
cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 in the absence
of TBAB cocatalyst where the cobalt-based framework 1a acts as an efficient catalyst, whereas the zinc-based framework 1b shows poor activity in the absence of TBAB (Scheme 2). The catalysts 1a and 1b were synthesized from the precyclophane ligand L by the reaction with respective metal salts (Scheme 1). The involvement of the cobalt-based
catalyst 1a in cyclic carbonate synthesis was investigated
by EPR, UV, and Raman spectroscopy where the intermediate carbonate
species bound to the catalyst 1a was characterized by
UV and Raman spectroscopy. Cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 as obtained by the catalysis reaction in Scheme 2 with catalyst 1a were converted to the polyesterurethane
materials (PEU1 and PEU2) sequentially by
first ring opening of 4 and 5 with ethylenediamine
to convert into the respective diols 6 and 7, which were subsequently annealed with terepthalyl chloride in the
presence of triethylamine at 120 °C as shown in Scheme 4. The polyesterurethanes PEU1 and PEU2 were characterized by FTIR, NMR,
and MALDI-TOF MS analyses. The thermal properties of the PEU1 and PEU2 were determined by TGA and DSC, and the surface
analysis was performed with SEM. The molecular weight of the polyesterurethanes
has been determined by GPC analysis. Hence, novel polyesterurethane
materials PEU1 and PEU2 were synthesized
from ring opening of five-membered cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 having phenyl-based substituents as compared
to the previously reported procedure with unsubstituted ethylene carbonate.11 Moreover, these cyclic carbonates were synthesized
in moderate yields by heterogeneous catalysis by a novel cobalt-based
1D coordination polymer without using cocatalyst TBAB or any ionic
liquids, which were previously reported to be present in the majority
of cases for ambient catalytic conversion of CO2 and epoxides
to cyclic carbonates.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Structure
of 1D Coordination Polymers
Many metal–organic frameworks
and coordination polymers are
known to perform interesting catalytic activities.40−43 A few 1D coordination polymers
synthesized from benzimidazole- and triazole-based precyclophane ligands
are reported to perform catalytic organic transformations.44,45 By considering the catalytic potentials of the precyclophane type
of ligands, we synthesized two new 1D coordination polymers based
on the ligand 2,6-bis(1H-benzotriazol-1-ylmethyl)pyridine
(L). The 1D coordination polymers 1a and 1b were synthesized by the reaction of the precyclophane ligand
2,6-bis(1H-benzotriazol-1-ylmethyl)pyridine (L) with the respective metal salts as per Scheme 1. 1a was isolated
as a blue crystalline solid, whereas 1b was isolated
as a white crystalline solid from the respective acetonitrile solutions.
The single crystals of 1a were grown by layering an acetonitrile
solution of cobalt chloride onto an acetonitrile solution of ligand L, whereas the single crystals of 1b were grown
by slow ether diffusion to a methanolic solution of 1b. 1a and 1b were characterized by FTIR
and single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods. The single-crystal data
and refinement parameters for 1a and 1b are
provided in Table 1. Cobalt complex 1a crystallizes in triclinic P1 space group, and its asymmetric unit consists of one
ligand L, one cobalt, and two chloride atoms. Ligand L adopts a tweezers conformation with the benzotriazole units
remaining as two arms of the tweezers having an angle of 14.37°
between the two benzotriazole planes. Two benzotriazole units remain
in opposite orientation with the two coordinating nitrogen atoms of
the benzotriazole units remaining in the opposite direction forming
a one-dimensional zigzag chain along the crystallographic “a” axis (Figure 1). The angle created by the benzotriazole donors from
two different ligands at the cobalt center is found to be 11.64(7)°.
Two chloride anions and two benzotriazole units from two different
ligands coordinate to a cobalt center creating a pseudo-tetrahedral
geometry with the angles ranging from 111.64(7)° [N(7)-Co(1)-N(1)]
to 105.35(5)° [N(7)-Co(1)-Cl(2)] (Table S1). The cobalt–nitrogen bond distances appear as 2.0289(17)
and 2.0299(17) Å (Table S1), which
are slightly less than the cobalt–nitrogen bond distance of
the reported cobalt-benzotriazole pentacoordinated complexes.46 The benzene rings of the benzotriazole units
from the same ligand remain in parallel orientation in the structure
of 1a with the distance between two centroids of benzene
rings measured as 3.79 Å, which is close to be considered as
a π-stacking interaction.47 The compound 1b crystallizes in the monoclinic C2/c space group, and its asymmetric unit consists of half
of the ligand L, one Zn center, and one nitrate anion.
In this coordination mode, L adopts a tweezers conformation
with two benzotriazole units remaining as two arms of the tweezers
with the angle between the two benzotriazole planes measuring 13.37°.
The orientation of the two benzotriazole unit remains opposite to
each other, which form a zigzag one-dimensional coordination polymer
along the crystallographic c axis (Figure S1). The angle created at the zinc center by the two
associated coordinating benzotriazole unit measures 115.79(10)°.
With the two nitrate anions and two benzotriazole units coordinating
to a zinc center, the coordination environment around each zinc center
remains pseudotetrahedral with the angles ranging from 115.79(10)°
[N(2)-Zn(1)-N(2)] to 133.42(12)° [O(1)-Zn(1)-O(1)] (Table S2). The zinc–nitrogen distance
ranges 2.0323(17) Å, which is slightly less than the reported
zinc–nitrogen bond distance in case of reported zinc benzotriazole
complexes (2.1–2.2 Å) where the zinc atom remains in pentacoordinated
environment.46 The benzotriazole benzene
rings from the same ligand L form π-stacking interaction
in the structure with the distance between the two benzene rings measuring
3.87 Å. The TGA of the coordination polymer 1a shows
thermal stability up to 300 °C, whereas the zinc-based coordination
polymer 1b shows thermal stability up to 250°C (Figures S2 and S3).

Catalytic Cycloaddition
of Epoxide and CO2
The catalytic cycloaddition
reaction of the epoxides 2 and 3 to the
corresponding cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 as
shown in Scheme 2 was
tried at 10 bar pressure of CO2 and 80o C in
a 100 mL reactor with one-dimensional coordination
polymers 1a and 1b as catalysts. In the
previously reported studies of conversion of CO2 to cyclic
carbonates, it was observed that the reaction proceeds with the addition
of the cocatalyst37,39,48,49tetrabutylammonium bromide along with the
metal-based catalysts. In recent years, ionic liquid-based heterogeneous
catalytic systems have been developed, which usually perform the catalytic
reaction at higher temperature and pressure50−52 but the reaction
yield is found to be very high and with higher turnover numbers. However,
the conversion of 2 and 3 to the respective
cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 were achieved
in 66 and 59% yield, respectively, with more than 1000 turnover number
(Table 2) by cobalt-based
catalyst 1a at 10 atmospheric pressure of CO2 and 80 °C in the absence of cocatalyst TBAB. The cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 were obtained exclusively without the
appearance of any side product or polymers, which was confirmed by
NMR spectroscopy. Although, in this case, the reaction condition is
not relatively milder as compared to the previously reported metal-based
catalysts, but it is interesting from the viewpoint of the TBAB-free
catalysis reaction. The zinc-based catalyst 1b on the
other hand showed lower activity in the absence of the cocatalyst
TBAB under the same reaction condition with a turnover number less
than 300 and yields less than 10% in both cases (Table 2). In order to see the effect
of TBAB on the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide, we performed
the blank experiment with styrene epoxide under the same reaction
condition without any catalyst and found the reaction yield to be
9% and a turnover number of 260 (Table 2). However, the involvement of catalyst 1a for the cycloaddition of CO2 and epoxide was found indispensable
by carrying out the blank experiment without the catalyst and only
with CO2 and styrene oxide, which shows no cyclic carbonate
peak in FTIR spectra, whereas the presence of the catalyst 1a in the same reaction under the same reaction condition showed an
intense cyclic carbonate peak at 1813 cm–1 (Figures S20 and S21). In order to establish the
reason behind the cobalt-based one-dimensional coordination polymer 1a acting as an efficient catalyst for the synthesis of the
cyclic carbonates 4 and 5, it is presumed
that the chloride ions bound to the free coordination sites of the
one-dimensional framework are first replaced by the epoxide substrates
following the ring opening of the epoxide by the replaced chloride
anions (Scheme 3).
The activation of the CO2 is supposed to take place via
the free pyridine base present in the precyclophane ligand (L) in the complex 1a followed by the insertion
of the CO2 into the metal–oxygen bond. However,
in case of zinc-based catalyst 1b, the presence of the
nitrate anion and a different coordination environment may possibly
slow down the epoxide ring opening and initiation of the catalysis
reaction,53 which might be the reason behind
the poor efficiency of 1b for the cycloaddition of epoxide
and CO2. This is supported by the fact that the coordination
polymer 1b catalyzes the cycloaddition reaction of the
epoxides and CO2 with a high turnover number in the presence
of the cocatalyst TBAB.

Scheme 3 Proposed Catalytic Cycle for the Catalytic
Reaction of Epoxide 2 with Catalyst 1a
Table 2 Catalytic Cycloaddition of CO2 and Epoxides Carried Out at 10 Atmospheric Pressure of CO2 and 80 °C Temperature
The mechanistic investigation was further supported
by the UV–vis
titration study of the catalyst 1a with epoxide 2, which indicates the binding of the epoxide with 1a as shown in Figure S4. The 1:1 mixture
of 1a and the epoxide 2 were kept in 10
bar of CO2 pressure at 80 o C for 2 h, and the
change in the UV–vis spectra of the mixture shows the formation
of the carbonate-bound proposed intermediate 1a′ (Figure 2).

Figure 2 UV–vis
spectra of the Co-based 1D coordination polymer 1a, 1a and epoxide 2 (both 8.575 × 10–6 M in DMSO), and 1:1 mixture of 1a and 2 after 2 h reaction with CO2 at 80 °C and
10 bar of CO2.

Resonance Raman spectroscopic analysis of the 1:1 mixture of 1a and 2 before and after the reaction for 2
h at 80 °C and 10 bar of CO2 also clearly reveals
the formation of the proposed intermediate 1a′ (Figure 3). After
the reaction with CO2, the appearance of the new peaks
in Raman spectra at 1708 and 1221 cm–1 can be attributed
to the carbon–oxygen double bond and carbon–oxygen single
bond stretching, respectively, whereas appearance of the new peak
at 781 cm–1 can be attributed to the Co–O
stretching of the intermediate species 1a′. The
peaks in the FTIR spectra for the carbon–oxygen double bond
and carbon–oxygen single bond for cyclic carbonate appear at
1790 and 1250 cm–1,respectively, whereas the peaks
corresponding to polycarbonate appear at 1747 and 1244 cm–1, respectively.54 Hence, the new signals
in resonance Raman spectra are due to the intermediate carbonate species 1a′.

(1a) and epoxide (2) in 1:1 ratio (10–2 M in DMSO) before (blue) and after (brown) the reaction
with CO2 at 10 bar pressure and 80 °C temperature.

The EPR spectra of catalyst 1a and
the epoxide 2 before and after the reaction with CO2 (Figure 4)
also indicate the
formation of a new species with a g value for the
mixture after the reaction with CO2 appearing at g⊥ = 2.27, whereas the g value for the same mixture before the reaction with CO2 appears at g⊥= 2.13.
Hence, UV–vis, resonance Raman, and EPR spectra coherently
suggest the formation of the intermediate carbonate species 1a′ as proposed in Scheme 3.

Figure 4 EPR spectra of 1a (brown) and 1a + 2 after
(blue) the reaction with CO2.

Regeneration of the catalyst 1a was studied by recovering
the catalyst from the reaction with styrene oxide and CO2 after 12 h. The recovered catalyst showed identical FTIR spectra
(Figure S22), which indicate that the catalyst
remains after the first catalytic cycle and the second catalytic cycle
with the regenerated catalyst 1a showed the formation
of the respective cyclic carbonates with a slightly less yield (Figure S23).

Synthesis of the Polyesterurethanes PEU1 and PEU2
The cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 as obtained from the catalytic reaction
were first treated
with 0.5 equiv of ethylenediamine at 100 °C to synthesize the
ring-opened diols 6 and 7 (Scheme 4). The use of the phenyl substituent-based five-membered cyclic
carbonates 4 and 5 gives the ring-opened
diols with higher selectivity as previously reported analogous compounds9 and is confirmed from the HPLC data of the respective
ring-opened diols 6 and 7 (Figures S25 and S26).The formation of the diols 6 and 7 was fully confirmed via 1H and 13C NMR as well as the ESI-MS studies (Figures S5–S10). The subsequent annealing of 6 and 7 with terepthalyl chloride in equivalent
ratios at 120 °C in the presence of 2 equiv of triethylamine
produces the polyesterurethanes PEU1 and PEU2, respectively. The PEU1 and PEU2 were
isolated as thick viscous materials. Formation of the polyesterurethane
was initially checked by the FTIR spectra, which show (Figure 5) the characteristic peaks
at 3390 (ν N–H), 2960 (ν C–H), 2880 (ν
C–H), 1720 (ν C=O), 1263 (ν C–O ester),
and 1103 (ν C–O urethane) cm–1 corresponding
to the polyurethane materials.11 In case
of proton NMR spectra of PEU1, the peaks at 8.12 and
7.98 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons of the terepthalyl group,
which indicate the incorporation of the terepthalyl moiety in the PEU1 as compared to the 1H NMR of the ring-opened
diol 6 (Figure S11). The 13C NMR spectra of the respective polyesterurethane PEU1 also include the peaks corresponding to the terepthalyl moiety at
165 and 133 ppm. In case of PEU2, the proton NMR shows
the peaks at 8.19 and 7.98 ppm corresponding to the terepthalyl moiety
as compared to the 1H NMR of ring-opened diol 7. The 13C NMR of PEU2 shows the peaks at
165 and 139 ppm corresponding to the terepthalyl unit in the polymer
(Figures S13 and S14). In order to study
the thermal behavior of both the polyesterurethane materials, TGA
and DSC studies were carried out. PEU1 shows thermal
stability up to 270 °C (Figure 6), whereas PEU2 shows thermal stability
up to 250 °C (Figures S15 and S16)
in the TGA data.

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of PEU1.

Figure 6 TGA and
DSC curves for PEU1.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Polyesterurethanes PEU1 and PEU2 from the respective cyclic carbonates 4 and 5.
The differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC) technique is an important
method to study the thermal transformation of polymer materials, and
it is necessary to study the melting point (Tm) of PEU1 and PEU2. As shown in Figure 6 and Figure S16, with the temperature increasing,
both PEU1 and PEU2 show an endothermic peak
at the range of 200 to 400 °C. The melting range of the curve
is long, the shape of the peak is not sharp, and it can be attributed
to the microphase-separation structures of the polyesterurethane.55 The higher value of the Tm (280 °C) in case of PEU2 can be due to
the strong H-bonding interactions between the NH groups of the respective
polyesterurethane molecules along with the π-bonding interaction
between the aromatic rings of the polyesterurethanes. The MALDI mass
of PEU1 (Figure 7) shows a typical polymeric pattern with an average 240 mass
difference, which is corresponding to the respective fragment-I coming
out of the PEU1. Although the MALDI mass of PEU2 was not determined, but the analogous FTIR peaks (Figure S24) at 3408, 2940, 2879, 1707, 1267, and 1149 cm–1 as compared to PEU1 confirm the formation
of the polyesterurethane material.

Figure 7 MALDI mass of the polyesterurethane PEU1.

The molecular weight determination
by GPC analysis showed the weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) in case of PEU1 and PEU2 as 5948 and 4224, respectively
(Figures S17 and S18). The polydispersities
for PEU1 and PEU2 were found to be 1.105
and 1.069, respectively. The molecular weight for the polyesterurethanes
is in the lower range as compared to the literature,11 which might be due to faster chain termination for the
presence of the acid chloride. The surface of the PEU1 and PEU2 were analyzed via SEM analysis (Figure 8 and Figure S19). Corresponding EDX spectra confirm the presence of polyesterurethane
materials by the appearance of the constituting elements N, O, and
C peaks (Figure 8 and Figure S19).

EDX spectra (right)

Conclusions
Two
novel polyesterurethane materials PEU1 and PEU2 have been synthesized and successfully characterized.
The polyesterurethane materials were synthesized from cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 via ring opening with ethylenediamine
and subsequent polymerization with terepthalyl chloride. Cyclic carbonates 4 and 5 were synthesized by a green method involving
two novel 1D coordination polymers 1a and 1b, among which cobalt-based 1a catalyzes the reaction
with a high turnover number in the absence of the cocatalyst TBAB,
whereas zinc-based 1b could not perform the catalysis
reaction with high efficiency in the absence of TBAB. The chloride
anions in case of 1a is supposed to act as an efficient
epoxide ring opening agent, which is the basic requirement for the
initiation of the cycloaddition reaction of epoxide and CO2; however, the nitrate anion does not perform the epoxide ring opening
very efficiently. The presence of a basic free pyridine moiety in 1a and 1b is supposed to activate the CO2 to respective carbamate, which subsequently insert into the
metal–epoxide bond to form the carbonate intermediate. The
mechanistic investigation by monitoring the reaction with UV–vis,
resonance Raman spectroscopy, and EPR spectroscopy showed the involvement
of the carbonate intermediate species 1a′ in case
of cobalt-based catalyst 1a. In order to establish this
mechanistic pathway unambiguously, the design of new catalysts incorporating
the free nitrogen bases are under investigation.

taken directly from one portion (2 mL) of this solution. Another portion
(2 mL) was heated in a metal pressure reactor at 80 °C under
10 bar of CO2 for 2 h. After 2 h, the UV–vis spectra
were recorded from the solution.

Sample Preparation for
Resonance Raman Experiment
A
solution of 1a and 2 (both 10–2 M) in DMSO was mixed in equimolar proportion, and one portion (2
mL) of this solution was directly submitted for resonance Raman experiment.
Another portion of the solution (2 mL) was heated in a metal pressure
reactor at 80 °C under 10 bar of CO2 for 2 h. After
2 h, the solution was submitted for resonance Raman experiment.

Sample Preparation for ESR Experiment
A 1:1 mixture
of catalyst 1a (100 mg, 0.21 mmol) and epoxide 2 (31.5 mg, 0.21 mmol) was added to a metal pressure reactor
and was heated to 80 °C for 2 h under 10 bar of CO2 pressure. After 2 h, the material was submitted for ESR analysis.

Synthesis of 1a
Ligand L (17.06
mg, 0.05 mmol) dissolved in 2 mL of acetonitrile was layered to cobalt(II)
chloride hexahydrate (11.89 mg, 0.05 mmol) in 2 mL of acetonitrile.
The deep blue crystal was obtained by the layering method. Yield:
10 mg (42.4%). FTIR: 3068, 2927, 1597, 1579, 1496, 1458, 1427, 1382,

Synthesis of 1b
Ligand L (85.3
mg; 0.25 mmol) in acetonitrile (5 mL) was added to zinc nitrate hexahydrate
(74.36 mg, 0.25 mmol) in acetonitrile (5 mL) and stirred at room temperature
for 3 h. This yielded a white precipitate. The precipitate was isolated
by centrifugation and recrystallized using methanol and diethyl ether
to give 1b complex as colorless crystals. Yield: 75 mg
(56.5%). FTIR: 3105, 2945, 1598, 1581, 1496, 1460, 1427, 1382, 1305,
