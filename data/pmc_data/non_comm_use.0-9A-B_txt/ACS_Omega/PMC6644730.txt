Icelike
gas hydrates deposited in the pipelines under low temperatures
and high pressures could remarkably reduce the transport efficiency,
and a low dosage of water-soluble polymers could act as kinetic hydrate
inhibitors (KHIs) to prevent gas hydrate formation. It was believed
that the hydrophobic moiety in the water-soluble polymers played a
vital role in enhancing the KHI performance. In this work, amphiphilic
copolymers containing hydrophobic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane
(POSS) and superhydrophilic sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) as well
as N-vinylcaprolactam (VCap) and N-vinylpyrrolidone (VP) were prepared, and an efficient effect of
the obtained amphiphilic copolymers on tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate
inhibition was found. When a certain amount of the amphiphilic copolymers
was introduced, the THF hydrate as an analogue of structure II gas
hydrates presented a prolonged induction time and gave rise to a looser
state rather than a crystalline solid. Analyses of low-field nuclear
magnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetry verified
that there were strong interactions between the copolymer and water
molecules by incorporation of SBMA units, which could enhance the
KHI properties of the prepared amphiphilic copolymers. Additionally,
the hydrophobic POSS in the amphiphilic copolymers could possibly
modulate the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, contributing to the
synergistical ability of the copolymers for THF hydrate inhibition.
It was suggested that the amphiphilic copolymers containing POSS and
zwitterionic units with VCap or VP could have potential for the inhibition
and antiaggregation of gas hydrates in the transportation pipelines.

==== Body
Introduction
Clathrate gas hydrates easily form under
low temperatures and high
pressures by the molecular interaction of the gas molecules, for example,
methane, ethane, propane, and so forth, with water.1−3 The icelike
nonstoichiometric compounds of gas hydrates aggregated and deposited
in the gas pipelines could result in plugging and then dramatically
reduce the transport efficiency.1−3 It was popular to obtain an effective
fluidity of gas by adding a high concentration of thermodynamic hydrate
inhibitors, such as methanol and ethylene glycol, but this approach
may have expensive costs and hazards to the environments.3 Alternatively, a series of low-dosage hydrate
inhibitors of kinetic hydrate inhibitors (KHIs) and antiagglomerates
(AAs) were developed to inhibit the formation and aggregation of gas
hydrates.3

Typically, poly(N-vinyllactam)s with cyclic structure
and amide groups, such as poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP) and poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCap), could
be used as KHIs to delay gas hydrate nucleation and crystal growth.3,4 It was assumed that the KHI molecules may adsorb on the hydrate
surface and reduce the hydrate–hydrocarbon interfacial tension.1 The inhibiting properties of PVP and PVCap have
been fully examined,3−7 and some kinds of VCap- or VP-involved copolymers were also reported
to increase the gas inhibition performance by introducing a functional
monomer with ionic or hydrophobic groups.3,4,8−11 For example, a commercial terpolymer
of VCap, VP, and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate called as Gaffix
VC-713 had a significant gas inhibition effect with respect to PVP
and PVCap homopolymers.3,4 Furthermore, a terpolymer of VCap,
VP, and 2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonate (AMPS) possessed
an enhanced salt and temperature tolerance by incorporating the anionic
AMPS units.4,7 The copolymer of VCap and 1-vinyl-3-alkylimidazolium
bromide also indicated the promising KHI performance to prevent or
delay gas hydrate formation especially in highly saline aqueous systems.8

The hydrophobic moiety in the water-soluble
polymers plays an essential
role in enhancing the KHI performance. It was believed that the KHI
performance of poly(N-vinyllactam)s could be improved
when the lactam ring size was increased with more hydrophobic cycle.3 The hydrophobic butyl and phenyl groups were
ever incorporated to obtain modified PVP that showed good kinetic
inhibition performance via lowering gas/liquid interfacial tension.9,10 By introducing the hydrophobic fluoroalkyl group, poly(fluoroalkyl
acrylamide)s also showed higher inhibition efficiency than those with
alkyl groups.11 Actually, the hydrophobic
groups in the structure of AAs similar to those of surfactants could
prevent the aggregation of gas hydrates by adjusting and controlling
its morphology so that the fluid could flow rather than plugging.3,4,10,12 Even though the above-mentioned results have been obtained, there
are still much work remaining to be further clarified, especially
for the effect of hydrophobicity on the gas hydrate inhibition properties.12

According to the geometries of the gas
molecules in the water cages,
clathrate gas hydrates can be classified as crystal structure I, structure
II, and structure H, which were generated under specific thermodynamic
conditions.1,2 Without the need to elevate pressure, water-soluble
tetrahydrofuran (THF) and water nonsoluble cyclopentane hydrates were
usually adopted as analogues of structure II gas hydrates to study
the KHI performance.13,19 Several methods for the measurement
of the induction time and the inhibitor concentration have been attempted
to examine the inhibition properties of KHIs and AAs more accurately.13,14,15 Additionally, the microscopic
and macroscopic appearances of the gas hydrates were observed directly
to study the hydrate–water droplet interaction that was considered
as the dominated factor on hydrate agglomeration.16,17

Zwitterionic polymers have been widely studied for antifouling
applications in biomedical engineering because of their strong hydration
effect.18 In
our previous studies, the amphiphilic copolymers containing hydrophobic
polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) and zwitterionic sulfobetaine
methacrylate (SBMA) have been synthesized and demonstrated the anti-icing
and antifogging abilities owing to the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance
as well as the hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions between
the copolymer and water molecules.20,21 POSS with
low surface energy could endow the copolymers with the hydrophobic
properties,22 and the superhydrophilic
SBMA units containing zwitterions could increase the water affinity
of the copolymer via the strong electrostatic interactions.23 With respect to the similar nature of gas hydrate
to ice, in this work, amphiphilic POSS-poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) copolymers were synthesized via atom
transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) for hydrate inhibition. THF
hydrate was adopted as structure II model, and the induction time
and morphology of the THF hydrate were measured by introducing the
prepared amphiphilic copolymers. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to examine
the interaction between the copolymers and water molecules. It was
hypothesized that the hydrophilic components of VCap, VP, and zwitterionic
SBMA as well as hydrophobic POSS could have a synergetic performance
for gas hydrate inhibition. With hydrophilic and hydrophobic counterparts,
amphiphilic copolymers themselves are expected with preferred properties
of KHIs as well as AAs for gas hydrate inhibition.

Results and Discussion
Chemical
Characterization
As shown in Figure 1, the amphiphilic copolymers
consisted of POSS, VCap, VP, and SBMA were prepared via ATRP, and
the THF hydrate inhibition performance was examined with the participation
of the copolymers. The synthesizing conditions of the prepared copolymers
are shown in Table 1. POSS-poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA)
copolymers prepared with three different feeding ratios were abbreviated
as POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)1, POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)2, and POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3, respectively. For comparison, poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) by using ethyl-2-bromoisobutanoate (EBIB) or ammonium
persulfate (APS) as the initiator was synthesized and abbreviated
as P(V-co-P-co-S)A and
P(V-co-P-co-S)C, respectively,
and the binary copolymer poly(VCap-co-VP) designated
as P(V-co-P) was also prepared by using azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN).

a The number-average molecular weight  and the
polydispersity index (PDI) of the
prepared copolymers were estimated by gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) using a sodium acetate buffer (0.5 M of NaAc and 0.5 M of HAc,
pH = ∼4.5) as the mobile phase in a Viscotek GPC system at
30 °C, with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.

b No adequate results can be obtained
for POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)1 and P(V-co-P).

c The number-average molecular weight
of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 was apparently higher than expected.

The chemical structure of the synthesized copolymers
was characterized
by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 2a, there are representative
δH (ppm) at 4.40 (a, j), 3.17 (c, l), 1.95 (h, p),
1.30–1.80 (b, d–f), 0.77–1.22 (i, q, and r),
3.75 (n), 3.53 (k), 2.92 (o), 2.37 (g), and 2.23 (m) in all the 1H NMR spectra, verifying that POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3, P(V-co-P-co-S)A, P(V-co-P-co-S)C, and P(V-co-P) have been successfully
synthesized.24,25

spectra (b) of the prepared copolymers.

The FTIR spectra of the synthesized copolymers are shown
in Figure 2b. The stretching
vibration characteristic peaks at 1112 cm–1 are
apparent, which associate with Si–O–Si in POSS.20 The peaks at 2954 and 1323 cm–1 are attributed to the C–H stretching vibration and the C–H
bending vibration, respectively. The signals at 1721, 1661, and 1466
cm–1 belong to the characteristic absorption peaks
of C=O in ester and amide groups and the C–H stretching
vibration in the −N+(CH3)2– groups, respectively. Meanwhile, the characteristic peaks
at 1039 and 1183 cm–1 are associated with the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching vibration peaks of S=O, respectively,24 indicating the introduction of SBMA units in
the copolymers. There are no characteristic peaks of POSS and S=O
in the P(V-co-P) spectrum.

Induction Time
The 19 wt % THF aqueous solution was
employed as a gas hydrate model of structure II for the measurement
of induction time. As shown in Figure 3, four droplets of each sample were examined simultaneously,
and the induction time was recorded when transition from transparent
into opaque occurred for any of the droplets (indicated with an yellow
circle in Figure 3a).
The induction time was evaluated for the THF hydrate containing diverse
concentrations (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 wt %) of the amphiphilic
copolymer POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 (Figure 3b)
and different copolymers at 0.1 wt % concentration (Figure 3c). As shown in Figure 3b, the inhibiting properties
on THF hydrate formation displayed the initial increased trend with
the increasing concentration of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 from 0.01 to 0.1%, but the induction time
dropped when the concentration increased to 0.7 wt %. In addition,
in the concentration range of 0.1–0.5 wt %, it showed a relatively
better suppression effect on the formation of THF hydrates with a
significant difference, and the discrepancy of the performance was
not significant among the concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt %.
The results could be attributed to the hydrogen bond interaction between
the copolymers and water molecules, which also resulted in the formation
of different kinds of bound water,20,21 which was
analyzed by DSC in the following section.

Figure 3 Induction time measurement
(a) and the effect of the concentration
of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 (b) and the different copolymers at 0.1 wt % concentration (c) in
a 19 wt % THF aqueous solution on the induction time. Statistical
significance of Student’s t test: *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01.

The induction time of THF hydrates containing different
copolymers
at the same concentration of 0.1 wt % was recorded in Figure 3c. It could be seen that the
amphiphilic copolymers containing the POSS groups could significantly
inhibit the THF hydrate formation than the P(V-co-P-co-S)C and P(V-co-P) copolymers without the POSS groups. Meanwhile, the amphiphilic
copolymers with different molecular weights showed almost similar
antiaggregation properties of THF hydrates. It could be assumed that
the hydrogen bonds between the hydrophilic moiety of the amphiphilic
copolymer and water promoted the copolymer adhering to the surface
of THF hydrates, inhibiting the formation of THF hydrates.

On
the other hand, the POSS groups around the outside of the THF
hydrates by rearranging could endow the copolymers with the antiaggregation
properties. In addition, the hydrophilic/hydrophobic equilibrium of
amphiphilic copolymers could positively influence the antiaggregation
of the THF hydrates. Importantly, the copolymer P(V-co-P-co-S)A synthesized via ATRP showed
superior antiaggregation performance to P(V-co-P-co-S)C, the copolymer with the same structure
synthesized via free-radical polymerization, owing to the lower value
of polydispersity. The copolymers with narrow molecular weight distribution
favored the formation of a regular and symmetrical void structure
when adhering to the hydrate surface. In contrast, the copolymers
with broad polydispersity were subjected to form littery and myriad
void structure, resulting in inferior antiaggregation of the THF hydrates.
To make things even worse, the gas hydrate would grow with a higher
speed when copolymers with broad molecular weight distribution were
added.26 Therefore, the induction time
may be related to the structure and concentrations of the amphiphilic
copolymers.

It is worth to mention that there are differences
in the measurement
of induction time and the mechanism between the THF hydrate and the
gas hydrate because of the solubility of THF in water.13 For convenience without the need to elevate
pressure, we used the THF hydrate in this study. For further investigation,
it is suggested to utilize cyclopentane as the structure II guest
molecule with reduced water solubility that can limit both nucleation
probability and growth rate13 or a natural
gas mixture that can mimic structure II gas hydrate formation at high
pressures and low temperatures in cooling rocking cells.7−11,13

THF Hydrate Morphology
We observed the THF hydrate
morphology during crystallization by an optical microscope equipped
with a high-speed camera and a low-temperature stage at −30
°C. Typical crystal morphologies of THF hydrates containing 0.01,
0.05, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 wt % of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 are shown in Figure 4. The crystals of pristine THF hydrates without
the copolymer showed a compact arrangement (Figure 4a), and the similar morphologies of the THF
hydrates containing 0.01 and 0.05 wt % of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 (Figure 4b,c) indicated that the lower concentrations
of the copolymer could not efficiently exhibit THF hydrate inhibition.
When the utilized concentration of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 reached 0.1 wt % (Figure 4d), the THF hydrate crystal morphology in
polygon was observed. As the concentration of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 increased to 0.3 wt % (Figure 4e) and 0.5 wt % (Figure 4f), the THF hydrates
appeared in a clear outline and regular arrangement, indicating a
great inhibiting behavior. However, the THF hydrate crystals became
bigger when the concentration increased to 0.7 wt % (Figure 4g). The results are corresponding
to the effect on the induction time, similar to the biomimetic ice
recrystallization activity of random copolymers reported in ref (27).

Figure 4 Typical crystal morphologies
of THF hydrates containing 0 (a),
0.01 (b), 0.05 (c), 0.1 (d), 0.3 (e), 0.5 (f), and 0.7 wt % (g) of
POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3.

The macroscopic crystallization
process was also observed by dropping
a 20 μL droplet of the 19 wt % THF aqueous solution with/without
the amphiphilic copolymer POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 on a 2 × 2 cm2 metal plate, as shown
in Figure 5. Typically,
it could be seen that the pristine 19 wt % THF/water droplet presented
a compact solid appearance. However, the droplet of the 19 wt % THF
aqueous solution containing 0.1 wt % POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 showed looser crystals, suggesting that
a low dose of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 displayed the antiaggregation ability of the gas hydrates.

the copolymer POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3.

Mobility State of Water
Molecules Measured by Low-Field NMR
To probe the mobility
states of protons of water in the THF hydrates,
low-field 1H NMR relaxometry was employed to measure the
water molecule activity by substituting TDF for THF. Figure 6a shows the relaxation time
(T2) inversion when adding a series of
concentrations of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 in the 19 wt % TDF/H2O solution. It can
be seen that the mixed solution containing the copolymer displayed
diminishing values of T2, compared to
that of the pristine 19 wt % TDF/H2O. The shorter T2 indicated a more difficult proton exchange,
resulting in the slower reorientational mobility of water molecules.
The SO3– groups from SBMA units in the
copolymer enhanced the hydrogen bond network in the 19 wt % TDF/H2O solution and formed strong hydration layers on the hydrate
surfaces. In addition, prompt chemical exchange of protons led to
unimodal distribution of T2 curves. Meanwhile, Figure 6b shows the T2 inversion for different copolymers with 0.1
wt % concentration in the 19 wt % TDF/H2O solution. It
was assumed that T2 of POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 exhibited a lower
value compared to POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)1 and POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)2, indicating that the copolymer molecular weight did
not significantly influence the T2. However,
when the molecular weight of the copolymer was beyond a certain range,
the acting force would be exerted between the copolymer and water
molecules. Additionally, T2 of P(V-co-P-co-S)A was lower than that
of P(V-co-P-co-S)C, inferring
that the copolymer with narrow polydispersity had a better interaction
with water molecules owing to the arrangement and stretch in the solution.
For the T2 curve of P(V-co-P-co-S)A, a smaller peak appeared at
616 ms, which can be attributed to the inhomogeneity of the solution
and brought about different microenvironment and proton exchange.
In the T2 curve of P(V-co-P-co-S)C, there was a abnormal increased
value of T2, and it was assumed that the
proton exchange between the copolymer and water molecules was hampered
because of the broad polydispersity.28,29

concentrations (a) and the different copolymers with 0.1 wt % concentration

Nonfreezable Bound Water
Amount in the Copolymers
For
further understanding of the antiaggregation properties of the prepared
copolymers, the amounts of bound water, nonfreezable bound water,
and freezable water in the copolymers were evaluated by the DSC analysis. Figure 7 shows the heating
thermograms of the copolymers with the similar water content (Wc ≈ 0.8) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
It can be seen that most of the melting peaks of the samples could
be fitted into two peaks, a smaller one around −20 to −12
°C and a sharp one at −7 to 0 °C close to the melting
point of pure deionized water. They could correspond to the melting
enthalpies of freezable bound water (Wfb) and freezable free water (Wff), respectively,
depending on the endothermic states of the copolymers during the melting
process. It could be verified that there was nonfreezable bound water
in most of the copolymers, similar to our previous studies.20,21 However, for P(V-co-P), it was difficult to distinguish
freezable bound water and freezable free water in the DSC curve.

Figure 7 DSC thermograms
of the copolymers with similar total water content
(Wc ≈ 0.8 mg/mg) at a heating rate
of 10 °C/min.

Water amounts at different
states in the copolymer/water binary
systems with similar total water contents analyzed by DSC are collected
in Table 2. The results
revealed that POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)1, POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)2, POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3, P(V-co-P-co-S)A, and P(V-co-P-co-S)C attended by water contents ∼0.8 were evaluated with the nonfreezable
bound water contents (Wnfb) of 0.20, 0.23,
0.25, 0.25, and 0.17 mg/mg, respectively, indicating similar nonfreezable
bound water contents in these copolymers. In addition, the total bound
water contents showed similar results about 0.32–0.40 mg/mg,
suggesting that all the copolymers containing VCap, VP, and SBMA with
or without POSS may have similar situations of polymer–water
interactions at a molecular level, which agreed with our previous
reports.20,21

Mechanism of the Amphiphilic Copolymers on THF Hydrate Inhibition
With water molecule-formed pentagon structure by the hydrogen bond
interaction, a supposed structure II THF hydrate is shown in Figure 8, in which the THF
molecules as the object are tied up in the crystal void. The hydrophilic
moieties of the amphiphilic copolymer could cohere with the THF hydrate
through the hydrogen bonds of amide groups in VCap or VP units and
electrostatic interaction of SBMA units to inhibit the nucleation
and growth of the THF hydrates. On the other hand, hydrophobic POSS
groups could adjust the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance of the copolymer,
leading to enhanced inhibition behaviors. Also, the amphiphilic copolymer
could display the antiaggregation property for hydrates as AAs because
of the performance similar to that of surfactants. Accordingly, the
POSS groups surrounded by hydrates and poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) acted on hydrates for enhancing the
dispersion of hydrate particles and antiaggregation of the THF hydrates.

POSS was purchased from
Hybrid Plastics, USA. VCap and VP were supplied by Hangzhou Lookchem
Internet Technology Co., Ltd., China. 2-Bromoisobutyryl bromide and
EBIB (>99%) were supplied by Beijing J&K Scientific Co., Ltd.,
China. [2-(Methacryloyloxy) ethyl] dimethyl-(3-sulfopropyl) ammonium
hydroxide, i.e., sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA), N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyl dipropylenetriamine
(PMDETA, >97%), and triethylamine (>99%) were obtained from
Tianjin
Xi’ensi Aupu Technology Co., Ltd., China. The above reagents
were used as received without further purification. CuBr, supplied
by Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China, was dissolved
in glacial acetic acid for 24 h, washed three times with methanol
and glacial acetic acid, and dried under vacuum to remove CuBr2 before use. APS, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl ethylenediamine,
AIBN, and other reagents were supplied by Tianjin Yuanli Chemical
Co., Ltd., China, and used as received.

Synthesis of POSS-Poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA)
The POSS-poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) copolymers were synthesized
via ATRP of VCap, VP,
and SBMA by using POSS-Br as the initiator that was prepared according
to refs (20) and (30) Typically, POSS-Br (0.02
mmol), VCap (1.2, 2.4, or 3.6 mmol), VP (0.6, 1.2, or 1.8 mmol), SBMA
(0.2, 0.4, or 0.6 mmol), and PMDETA (0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 2
mL mixed solvent of THF/water (1/1, v/v) and were injected into the
10 mL standard Schlenk flask. The solution was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles under nitrogen atmosphere, and then CuBr (0.06 mmol) was added
quickly to the flask. Three freeze–pump–thaw cycles
were subsequently carried out to exclude the remaining oxygen. The
reaction mixture was stirred at 35 °C for 40 h. The POSS-poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) copolymer was obtained by
dialysis against deionized water for 3 days (MWCO 2000) and recovered
by lyophilization. For comparison, poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) without POSS was also synthesized by using EBIB
or APS as the initiator, and the binary copolymer poly(VCap-co-VP) was also prepared by using AIBN under similar conditions.

Characterization
The chemical structure of the prepared
copolymers was characterized by 1H NMR and FTIR. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on an Inova 500 MHz spectrometer
(USA) using D2O as the solvent, and the FTIR spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 spectrometer (USA) using the
KBr pellet technique.

Induction Time Tests
A 19 wt % THF
aqueous solution
was used as a gas hydrate analogue of structure II. The induction
time was measured by the crystallizing time of the droplets (5 μL)
of the THF solution containing a certain amount of the copolymer.
The samples on the 2 × 2 cm2 iron plates were placed
on a cold plate (Tianjin Jing Yi Industry & Trade Co., Ltd., China)
and controlled at −15 °C (25% relative humidity). The
induction time was recorded when any of the four droplets changed
from transparent to opaque. The results presented are the average
of 7–10 measurements of each sample. Statistical analyses were
performed using Student’s t test. A p-value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

Morphology Observation
The morphology of the 19 wt
% THF aqueous solution with and without copolymers was recorded by
a high-speed camera (the Cooke Corporation, USA) with a mercury fluorescent
lamp in the microscope (BX51, Olympus, Japan). The sample was prepared
by dropping a 10 μL droplet on a coverslip and placed on the
cold plate (BCS196, Linkam, UK). The sample was cooled from room temperature
to −30 °C at a cooling rate of 10 °C/min and maintained
for 10 min, and then the morphology of the crystalline THF hydrate
was observed and photographed. The antiaggregation performance of
the THF hydrates was measured by dropping 20 μL droplets of
19 wt % THF aqueous solution with or without the copolymer POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 on the iron plate.
After being placed on a cold plate predetermined at −15 °C (25% relative humidity) for a certain
time, the droplet sample was stirred by a pipette tip and it quickly
became solid. The appearance change of the droplet was recorded by
a digital camera at once.

Low-Field NMR Tests
The low-field 1H NMR
measurements were carried out on a Bruker minispec mq20 spectrometer
at a 20 MHz proton resonance frequency according to ref (31). Samples at different
concentrations in the 19 wt % TDF aqueous solution were placed in
the NMR tube with a 10 mm outer diameter. The free induction decay
signals were recorded with Carr−Purcell−Meiboom−Gill
(CPMG) pulse sequences, where the spin-spin relaxation time (T2) distribution curve was obtained through an
inverse Laplace transform-based CONTIN analysis. The minispec has
a typical π/2 pulse length of about 3 μs and a receiver
dead time of about 13 μs.

DSC Analysis
The
bound water amount in the copolymers
was analyzed by DSC (TA Q2000, USA) according to our previous study.20 Briefly, the samples were prepared by adding
a certain amount of deionized water into the copolymers (about 4–5
mg) and stabilized in the aluminum pan for 10 days at room temperature.
When no mass changes were detected, the samples were tested at a cooling/heating
rate of 10 °C/min by purging nitrogen gas in the range of 20
to −70 °C. The total water content (Wc), the freezable water content (Wf), the nonfreezable bound water content (Wnfb), and the bound water content (Wb) in the samples were calculated according to the following
equations:32−37 1   2   3   4  where mw and mp represent the masses of water
and the copolymer,
respectively. Ac was the integration of
the endothermic peak in the heating curves and 334 denoted the enthalpies
of free and freezable water (J/g).32 The
freezable bound water content (Wfb) was
referred to the area of the symmetric peak around −15 °C
in the heating runs, and the freezable free water content (Wff) was the difference between Wf and Wfb according to refs (32) and (33). The bound water content
(Wb) was the sum of Wfb and Wnfb. The melting temperatures
of the freezable bound water (Tfbm) and
the freezable free water (Tffm) were designated
as the peak temperatures of the fitting symmetric peak and the melting
peak, respectively, in the heating curves of the samples.

Conclusions
The amphiphilic copolymers containing POSS, VCap, VP, and SBMA
synthesized via ATRP demonstrated a great performance on THF hydrate
inhibition. The induction time of the THF hydrates containing 0.1–0.5
wt % of the resultant copolymer POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 displayed the ability of inhibiting nucleation
and formation. POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 showed a high value of nonfreezable bound water analyzed
by DSC and a lower relaxation time T2 measured
by LF NMR. Moreover, the microcosmic crystallization morphology of
regular and clear polygonal outline and the macroscopic crystallization
process of THF hydrates containing POSS-P(V-co-P-co-S)3 manifested an important effect on antiaggregation,
attributing to the amphiphilicity and the hydrogen bond interaction
between the copolymers and water molecules. It was assumed that the
VCap- and VP-related units in the copolymers could behave as KHIs
because of their cyclic structure including the nitrogen element,
and zwitterionic SBMA in the amphiphilic copolymers could enhance
the KHI properties by its strong electrostatic interaction with water
molecules. In addition, the hydrophobic POSS groups could regulate
the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance, endowing the amphiphilic copolymer
with the properties of THF hydrate inhibition. The amphiphilic copolymer
POSS-poly(VCap-co-VP-co-SBMA) would
contribute to novel potential applications for gas hydrate inhibition
during transportation in the pipeline.
