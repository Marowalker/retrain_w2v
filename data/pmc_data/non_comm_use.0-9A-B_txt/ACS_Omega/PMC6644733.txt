As
promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),
Fe-containing Li-rich compounds of Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 and 1.9 ≤ y ≤ 2.05) have been successfully synthesized by calcining
the spherical precursors with appropriate amounts of lithium carbonate.
The structures, morphologies, and chemical states of these compounds
are characterized to better understand the corresponding electrochemical
performances. With an increase of lithium content, Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy evolves from a complex layered-spinel
structure to a layered structure. The lithium content also affects
the average size and adhesion of the primary particles. At 0.1 C,
sample x = 0.1 shows the highest first charge/discharge
specific capacities (338.7 and 254.3 mA h g–1),
the highest first Coulombic efficiency (75.1%), the lowest first irreversible
capacity loss (84.4 mA h g–1), the highest reversible
discharge specific capacity, and good rate capability. Notably, voltage
fading can be alleviated through the adjustment of structural features.
Such superior electrochemical performances of sample x = 0.1 are ascribed to the hierarchical micro-/nanostructure, the
harmonious existence of complex layered-spinel phase, and the low
charge-transfer resistance. An integral view of structure evolution
from layered to spinel during synthetic control and cycling process
is provided to broaden the performance scope of Li–Fe–Ni–Mn–O
cathodes for LIBs.

1 Introduction
A continuously
growing population and depletion of traditional
fossil fuels have triggered a large demand for alternative energy
storage systems with green chemistry, high efficiency, long life,
high safety, and low cost.1−3 Owing to the high energy density
and efficient working capability without pollution penalties, lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs)4 have presently occupied
a dominant position in consumer electronics.5 Moreover, LIBs are also considered to be promising to power more
challenging fields, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid EVs
(HEVs) for transportation.6−8 However, the further development
of present LIBs is impeded by previous widely studied cathode materials
with insufficient specific capacities (<170 mA h g–1), such as layered LiCoO2, spinel LiMn2O4, olivine LiFePO4, and layered LiMn1/3Ni1/3Co1/3O2.9 For large-scale applications, the alternative cathode materials
have to maintain a comparable performance and low cost by involving
manganese, iron, or nickel species rather than the limited cobalt
resource in earth.

Among the reported cathode materials, lithium-rich
transition-metal
oxides represented by the chemical formula xLi2MnO3·(1 – x)LiMO2 (M = Co, Ni, Fe, etc.)10−13 have attracted significant attention and are considered
to be the most promising candidates for high-capacity cathodes of
next-generation LIBs.14−19 Despite some superiorities of these cathodes, several fatal inherent
pitfalls still should be overcome to integrate them into commercial
use, including the low initial Coulombic efficiency, poor rate capability,
and discharge voltage fading. As a primary cause for these drawbacks,
the structural instability during the cycling process gives rise to
phase transformation from layered to spinel phase.20−23 Various strategies have been
conducted on these Li-rich cathodes, such as structural design, ion
doping, and surface coating. Also, considerable improvements have
been achieved in reversible capacities and rate performances.24,25 The design of a hierarchical micro-/nanostructure is demonstrated
to be effective to improve lithium storage properties.26 In addition, the rate capability can be significantly
improved by the formation of a complex layered-spinel heterostructure
because the three-dimensional (3D) Li+ diffusion channels
provided by the spinel structure could greatly enhance the Li+ diffusion rate.27

In the
perspective of cost and raw materials, Fe–Mn metal-based
systems would be economically attractive because of their high content
of iron and manganese.28−36 However, as a newly developing field, the electrochemical performances
and stability issues of these systems limit their practical applications.
Furthermore, the synthetic process of low-cost-based systems to form
the ideal structure is highly complex, involving several intricate
steps.28 The addition of Ni component can
effectively improve the average voltage of Fe-containing Li2MnO3.28,33 Moreover, the substitution of
Co by Fe can also help to mitigate the decrease in the average discharge
voltage upon cycling, reported by Nayak et al.36 Therefore, Li-rich cathodes containing iron and nickel
are promising low-cost candidates for commercial LiCoO2. To exploit Li–Fe–Ni–Mn–O compounds
with high performance, much efforts have been invested to improve
the cycling stability, such as ion doping, surface modification,27,37,38 and stepwise precycling treatments.39,40 It is generally known that the morphology and internal crystal structure
of the cathode materials play a critical role in Li+ transport
conductivity. The effective combination of hierarchical micro-/nanoarchitecture
morphology with a well-designed “layered-spinel” integrated
structure on these low-cost Li-rich cathodes is still absent. The
hierarchical materials can take the merits of both nanomaterials and
micromaterials in achieving a shorter Li+ pathway and less
surficial side effect. Furthermore, the Li+ diffusion rate
can be greatly enhanced owing to the 3D Li+ diffusion channels
provided by the spinel structure. Favorable kinetics and good electrochemical
capability can be predicted from the hierarchical cathodes with the
complex layered-spinel phase.

In this paper, the above well-designed
structure was successfully
applied on Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.3 and 1.9 ≤ y ≤
2.05) compounds without any following modification to achieve good
electrochemical performances. The hierarchical micro-/nanoarchitecture
morphology was realized by an energy-saving and labor-saving approach
(the carbonate coprecipitation method). Scheme 1 shows an illustration for the synthetic
process of Li–Fe–Ni–Mn–O compounds with
hierarchical micro-/nanostructures. A layered-spinel heterostructure
was directly formed through a rational control of the lithium content.
The effect of the lithium content was explored on the structure evolution,
morphological characteristics, and electrochemical performances of
these compounds. An integral mechanism of structure and electrochemical
evolution was illustrated to explain the performance scope of these
hierarchical Li–Fe–Ni–Mn–O cathode materials.

Materials with Hierarchical Micro-/Nanostructures
2 Results and Discussion
The structural information of the precursor and as-prepared compounds
is displayed in Figure 1. The precursor shows a typical hexagonal structure with the space
group of R3c, corresponding to MnCO3 rhodochrosite.41 As for the lithiated
compounds, normalized on the basis of the intensity of the (003) reflection,
all the main diffraction peaks marked by their number can be indexed
to a layered α-NaFeO2-type structure (the space group
of R3̅m). Additional peaks
between 20° and 25° are considered as superlattice reflections
of the Li2MnO3-like structure (the space group
of C2/m). The enlarged graph of
the (003) reflection suggests that sample x = 0.1
achieves the highest intensity of the (003) peak. The enlarged graph
of the (104) reflection indicates that the increasing lithium content
leads to a continuous increase in the (104) d-spacing.
In addition, the ratio of I003/I104 was calculated and given in Figure 1. The result shows that sample x = 0.1 presents the highest value (1.656), indicating the
lowest cation disordering.42 Obvious spinel
phase appears at 36° in sample x = 0. An inconspicuous
spinel peak is also present in sample x = 0.1 in
the 2θ range of 43–44°, indicating the presence
of a small amount of spinel phase. Notably, an impurity phase of LiOH
appears when the lithium content reaches higher (x = 0.2 and x = 0.3), indicating that the lithium
uptake reaches its maximum beyond x = 0.1. Overall,
the structure of the corresponding materials undergoes dramatic changes
with an increase of the lithium content: starting from a mixed layered-spinel
structure (x = 0 and x = 0.1) to
a more layered structure (x = 0.2 and x = 0.3). Schematic mechanism of the structure evolution process is
also illustrated in Figure 1. These general observations are useful toward understanding
the complex layered-spinel structure and thus explaining the corresponding
electrochemical behaviors.

samples; schematic
illustration of the structure evolution process during synthetic control.

Morphological design of 3D hierarchical
architectures can address
some major problems of nanostructured or microstructured cathodes,
such as material stability and ion-transfer pathway.43Figure 2 exhibits SEM images of the carbonate precursor and the lithiated
compounds: Li1.0Fe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55O1.9 (x = 0), Li1.1Fe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55O1.95 (x = 0.1), Li1.2Fe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55O2 (x = 0.2),
and Li1.3Fe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55O2.05 (x = 0.3). As presented in Figure 2A,a, the spherical
carbonate precursors (15–25 μm) are constituted of similar
nanosized primary grains. The secondary particles of each lithiated
compound keep the typical analogous spherical morphology with a 3D
hierarchical micro-/nanostructure. The resulting materials possess
the combined performances of the first and secondary structures.26 As marked by the pink circles, the observed
pores on the surface of the particles are related to the CO2 escape during calcination, which can conduce to electrolyte percolation.
However, the detailed morphologies of these lithiated compounds undergo
changes with the increase of the lithium content. The average size
of the primary grains increases from sample x = 0
to x = 0.3, indicating that the addition amount of
lithium carbonate affects the growth of primary grains during calcination.
Unfortunately, the primary particles are observed to be more adhesive
to each other when the lithium content reaches higher (x = 0.2, x = 0.3), which is not beneficial to lithium
diffusion and electrolyte percolation.

(B,b) x = 0, (C,c) x = 0.1, (D,d) x = 0.2, and (E,e) x = 0.3; EDS pattern
of sample x = 0.1
and the corresponding element mapping of Fe, Ni, Mn, and O.

As shown in Figure S1, nitrogen adsorption
experiments were carried out to examine the pore characteristics of
the as-prepared materials. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) specific surface area of sample x = 0.1 was
measured to be the highest (15.41 m2 g–1) among all the samples. The pore size distribution of sample x = 0.1 calculated using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
method is mainly around 23 nm. Good electrochemical performances of
sample x = 0.1 are expected from its good hierarchical
micro-/nanostructure, small primary grains, high specific surface
area, and rational porosity for electrolyte percolation. The following
results of electrochemical tests also verify this prediction. Moreover,
sample x = 0.1 was examined by energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to further analyze the element distribution.
As presented in Figure 2, except that the Li element cannot be detected by EDS, other elements
of Fe, Ni, Mn, and O are all determined. In addition, the even dispersion
of these elements in sample x = 0.1 is also demonstrated
by the corresponding EDS mapping. Elements with uniform distribution
have paved the way for good electrochemical performance of this lithiated
compound.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM),
and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are utilized to illustrate
the specific structure feature of the remarkable sample x = 0.1, and the results are displayed in Figure 3. Figure 3a explicitly exhibits a primary spherical particle
with a diameter of 2–3 μm, which is in accordance with
that observed in SEM images. The corresponding SAED pattern of the
primary particle is shown in Figure 3b. A typical lithium/transition-metal cation ordering
in the transition-metal layer with an array of hexagonal symmetry
dots is presented to probe the formation of a well-layered structure
of the Li-rich material.44 Meantime, the
interplanar spacing of lattice fringe is measured to be 0.44 nm from
the HRTEM image in Figure 3c, smaller than a typical value (0.47 nm) of other Li-rich
materials without the Fe element, which is ascribed to the different
atomic radii of transition metals.27 Furthermore,
as shown in Figure 3d, a small amount of spinel phase can be observed on the edge of
the particle between the layered fringes, resulting from the lithium
diffusion process during calcination. All these features indicate
the formation of a layered-spinel heterostructure in the synthetic
process. The observed layered-spinel structure of sample x = 0.1 is also well consistent with the result of X-ray diffraction
(XRD) pattern.

phase, and (d) HRTEM image of the spinel phase. XPS of (e) Fe 2p,
(f) Ni 2p, and (g) Mn 2p on the surface of sample x = 0.1.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) is carried out to confirm
the surface chemical states of the component elements in the as-prepared
material. Figure 3e–g
displays the detailed XPS spectra of Fe 2p, Ni 2p, and Mn 2p on the
surface of sample x = 0.1. The main peak of Fe 2p3/2 spectra exhibits a binding energy of 711.1 eV, which should
be attributed to Fe3+.45 The
binding energy of 854.9 eV in Ni 2p3/2 is in good agreement
with the valence of Ni2+ in layered Li[Li1/3–2x/3NixMn2/3–x/3]O2 compounds.46 As for Mn 2p3/2 spectra, the binding energy (642.4 eV)
fits well with the typical value of Mn4+ ions in manganese-based
layered compounds.47 Therefore, the surface
predominant oxidation states of Fe, Ni, and Mn in sample x = 0.1 are believed to be +3, +2, and +4, respectively.

Figure 4 shows the
charge/discharge voltage profiles of the samples (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2) cycled between 2 and 4.8 V at 0.1 C. The corresponding
differential capacity versus voltage plots (dQ dV–1) is also compared to verify the structure
transformation during cycling. For the first charge process, two typical
voltage plateaus around 4.0 and 4.5 V are observed, corresponding
to the extraction of lithium ions from the layered structure and the
extraction of lithium and oxygen ions from the Li2MnO3 structure, respectively.14 The
4.0 V plateau of sample x = 0 is much shorter than
those of sample x = 0.1 and sample x = 0.2, indicating a lower corresponding charge specific capacity
due to the less layered structure of sample x = 0.
The length of 4.5 V plateau decreases with the increasing lithium
content, confirming that the release of oxygen from the Li2MnO3 structure is related with the amount of lithium.
This conclusion is also demonstrated by the height change of the oxidation
peaks at ∼4.5 V in the first differential capacity curves.
After the first charge, reduction peaks at 3.2 V can be observed from
all the samples during the discharge process. These peaks are believed
to be the activation of the Li2MnO3 phase, corresponding
to the reduction of Mn4+ ions. Furthermore, the stubborn
structure transformation during cycling is obviously showed by the
black rectangles in the corresponding differential capacity versus
voltage plots. The gradual appearance of the reduction peaks at 2.8
V has been believed to be the characteristics of spinel structures.
Sample x = 0 shows the serious structure transformation
from layered to spinel phase during cycling. Notably, the unexpected
phase transformation can be alleviated by increasing the lithium content,
and thus, the layered structure can be more stable. However, excessive
lithium content is not beneficial for the activation of first charge/discharge
specific capacity. Therefore, the complex layered-spinel structure
of sample x = 0.1 is rational and preferred by the
good release of reversible specific capacity.

at 0.1 C and the corresponding differential
capacity versus voltage plots (dQ dV–1).

Figure 5a
gives
the discharge specific capacities and Coulombic efficiencies of all
the samples at 0.1 C. Meantime, Table 1 summarizes the detailed data of charge/discharge specific
capacities and first Coulombic efficiency. Among all the samples,
sample x = 0.1 delivers the highest first charge/discharge
specific capacities (338.7 and 254.3 mA h g–1) and
the highest first Coulombic efficiency (75.1%). Also, the first irreversible
capacity loss of sample x = 0.1 is 84.4 mA h g–1, which is much lower than the other samples. After
50 cycles, the reversible discharge specific capacity of sample x = 0.1 achieves 184.4 mA h g–1, which
is also the highest among all the samples. Sample x = 0.2 shows the best cycle stability with a high-capacity retention
of 85.7%, ascribed to its more stable layered structure, which is
consistent with the result of structure analysis. In addition, the
presence of LiOH phase detected from the XRD patterns in sample x = 0.3 should be responsible for the deterioration of the
electrochemical capacities. Furthermore, the issue of discharge voltage
fading is still present in all the samples, as observed from the comparison
of discharge medium voltage in Figure 5b. The voltage fading phenomenon should be ascribed
to the continuous structure transformation from layered to spinel
phase, which is well consistent with the analysis of the differential
capacity versus voltage plots in Figure 4. Serious voltage fading along cycling is
observed in sample x = 0.3, which is related with
the undesired impurity phase. Therefore, appropriate lithium content
is beneficial for the cycling performance and the alleviation of voltage
fading during cycling. Besides, the phenomenon of capacity fading
is present in the first 10 cycles for all the samples. The crystallinity
of our prepared low-cost Li-rich cathode material containing Fe is
not so high as some other Li-rich cathodes without Fe element because
of the lower calcination temperature (750 °C). However, experiments
on optimizing calcination temperature show that the higher calcination
temperature (900 °C) is not beneficial for the electrochemical
performances, such as cycling stability and rate capability. In addition,
the structure evolution with cycling and discharge voltage fading
is also considered to be related with the capacity fading. The migration
of transition-metal cations during cycling has also been reported
to be responsible for the gradual capacity degradation and potential
decay during the cycling of the Li-rich cathode material. To fix transition-metal
cations in the parent layered structure, polyanion doping is believed
to be effective to maintain the layered structure of the Li-rich cathode
material.48 After considering multifactor
comprehensive evaluation, sample x = 0.1 exhibits
the best electrochemical performances at 0.1 C, including the high
reversible specific capacity and low rate of discharge voltage fading.

Compared with other samples, sample x = 0.1 presents
the best rate performance. The rate capability (Figure 6) from 0.5 to 5 C after activation at 0.1
C for three cycles highlights the advantages of its 3D hierarchical
structure and complex layered-spinel structure. The charge/discharge
curves at 30th and 60th cycles are also shown in the inset of Figure 6. The reversible
specific capacities after 30 cycles of sample x =
0.1 are 157.2 mA h g–1 for 0.5 C, 146.5 mA h g–1 for 1 C, 140.8 mA h g–1 for 2 C,
and 116.7 mA h g–1 for 5 C. The reversible specific
capacities after 60 cycles of sample x = 0.1 are
144.8 mA h g–1 for 0.5 C, 133.4 mA h g–1 for 1 C, 129.9 mA h g–1 for 2 C, and 109.2 mA
h g–1 for 5 C. The good rate capability of sample x = 0.1 is related to the fast kinetics of its hierarchical
micro-/nanostructure. The 3D Li+ diffusion channel can
be provided by the spinel phase formed during the synthetic process,
thus speeding up the transport of lithium ions.

Figure 6 Rate capability of sample x = 0.1 and the corresponding
charge/discharge curves at the 30th cycle and 60th cycle.

Figure 7a–c
displays the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the as-prepared samples
in the voltage range of 2–4.8 V. Different samples show a similar
tendency during the cycling process. During the first charge process,
the anodic peak at ∼4.0 V is predominantly related to the oxidation
from Ni2+ to Ni4+. The anodic peak at 4.6–4.7
V is associated with the extraction of Li2O from the Li2MnO3 component, which is accompanied by the irreversible
electrochemical activation reaction. During the first discharge process,
the cathodic peak at ∼3.8 V is ascribed to the reduction from
Ni4+ to Ni2+. The reduction from Mn4+ to Mn3+ is revealed by the cathodic peak at ∼3.2
V, and its corresponding oxidation peak of Mn3+/Mn4+ begins to appear in the following two cycles. The absence
of the anodic peak of Mn3+/Mn4+ in the first
cycle indicates that Mn4+ in the as-prepared materials
is electrochemically inactive. Therefore, the layered structure can
be stabilized by the inactive Mn4+. In addition, the good
overlaps of the profiles in the second and third cycles indicate the
good electrochemical reversibility of sample x =
0.1.

first three cycles. (d) Nyquist plots of the as-prepared samples before
cycling. (e–h) Differential capacity versus voltage plots (dQ dV–1) of sample x = 0.1 at different rates during cycling.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can
reveal the kinetics
of electrochemical reactions of electrodes. Figure 7d shows the Nyquist plots at open-circuit
potential to better understand the superior electrochemical performance
of sample x = 0.1. The intercept of the semicircle
at the highest frequency with the horizontal axis (Z′) stands for the uncompensated Ohmic resistance (RΩ). The impedance spectrum comprises a
high-frequency semicircle and a low-frequency slope, which are associated
with the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and Li+ diffusion into the bulk material (Warburg impedance, ZW), respectively.49 By comparing the size of the semicircles, it can be easily found
that sample x = 0.1 presents the lowest value of Rct, indicating the best kinetics of electrochemical
reactions and thus exhibiting superior rate capability. In addition,
there is no significant increase of the Rct value in the EIS curve of sample x = 0.1 after
50 cycles at 0.1 C (Figure S2), indicating
a good cycling stability of our prepared material. Differential capacity
curves of sample x = 0.1 at different rates are depicted
in Figure 7e–h.
Phase transformation from layered to spinel phase during cycling can
be clearly seen from these profiles. Obviously, the reduction peaks
below 3.5 V gradually shift left with the increasing rates, indicating
the discharge voltage fading. It is believed that the voltage fading
is related with the degree of polarization at high rate as well as
the unexpected phase transformation from layered to spinel. Although
voltage fading is observed, the redox of Mn4+/Mn3+ and Ni4+/Ni2+ can still be reversible at different
rates. In brief, the superior rate capability of sample x = 0.1 is ascribed to the stable cycling of Mn4+/Mn3+ in the 3 V region and Ni4+/Ni2+ in
the 4 V region.

Superior electrochemical performance of sample x = 0.1 is attributed to three aspects, as illustrated in Figure 8. First, the stable
hierarchical micro-/nanostructure possesses the merits of both micro-
and nanosized materials. At high voltage, the electrode polarization
is mainly associated with the surficial side reactions between the
electrode and the electrolyte. As for our designed hierarchical structure,
less surficial side reaction and enough rational porosity for infiltrating
liquid electrolyte play important roles in promoting lithium-ion transport
and electron transfer. Second, the uniform element distribution probes
that the rational cation arrangement can maintain the durability of
the layered structure. Meantime, the compact secondary particles can
maintain the stability of the hierarchical structure, which can be
demonstrated by the SEM images of the electrode after 50 cycles at
0.1 C (Figure S3). The spinel phase generated
on the surface of the particles cannot easily extend into the bulk
region owing to the closely packed nanoparticles. Thus, the collapse
rate of the layered structure can be slowed down, and voltage fading
can be alleviated. Third, the harmonious coexistence of layered and
spinel phases formed during synthetic control is also an important
factor to contribute to the good rate capability. Notably, the spinel
phase formed during the synthetic process can provide 3D channels
for lithium-ion transport, which is quite different from the spinel-like
phase derived from the structure transformation during the cycling
process.

3 Conclusions
The
3D Li-rich Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy (0
≤ x ≤ 0.3 and 1.9 ≤ y ≤ 2.05) cathode materials with a hierarchical micro-/nanostructure
have been successfully synthesized through the carbonate coprecipitation
method. By optimizing the lithium content, Li1.1Fe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55O1.95 with
the complex layered-spinel phase delivers high reversible capacity,
superior rate capability, and decent suppression of voltage decay.
Such superior electrochemical performances benefit from the stable
structural and morphological characteristics. The hierarchical micro-/nanostructure
takes the advantages of both nano- and microparticles. Uniform element
distribution and compact secondary particles with rational porosity
can maintain the structural stability and alleviate voltage fading.
The complex layered-spinel phase provides a 3D channel for lithium-ion
transport and speeds up the electronic transmission, which is beneficial
for the good rate capability. In addition, the structure evolution
from layered to spinel during synthetic control and cycling process
is analyzed emphatically to further interpret the corresponding electrochemical
performances. From the view of low cost and environmental friendliness,
the hierarchical Li–Fe–Ni–Mn–O compounds
with improved electrochemical performances will further become promising
cathode materials of LIBs.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials Synthesis
The spherical
cathode materials were prepared using a carbonate coprecipitation
technology, followed by heat treatment. Nickel sulfate hexahydrate
(NiSO4·6H2O), manganese sulfate monohydrate
(MnSO4·H2O), iron sulfate heptahydrate
(FeSO4·7H2O), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O) were used as starting reagents to prepare the spherical
precursor particles. During the reaction, a 2 mol L–1 mixed transition-metal solution (Fe/Ni/Mn = 0.1:0.15:0.55) was slowly
pumped into a continuously stirred tank reactor at a flow rate of
1 L h–1 under a N2 atmosphere. Simultaneously,
a 2 mol L–1 Na2CO3 solution
as a precipitant and a 0.2 mol L–1 NH3·H2O solution as a chelating agent were also fed
into the reactor to maintain pH inside the reactor at 8.0. The operating
temperature (50 °C) and the stirring speed (1000 rpm) of the
mixture in the reactor were strictly controlled. The precipitated
precursor particles were filtered, washed with deionized water several
times, and dried at 120 °C overnight. Afterward, the obtained
carbonate precursors were thoroughly mixed with appropriate amounts
of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) by grinding. After
that, the mixtures were calcined at 750 °C for 15 h in air and
then cooled down to room temperature to form Li1+xFe0.1Ni0.15Mn0.55Oy (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3) cathode
materials. To compensate for the possible lithium loss during the
high-temperature calcination, a 2% excess of lithium carbonate was
used.

4.2 Materials Characterizations
The crystalline
phases were identified with XRD (Rigaku Ultima IV-185) using a Cu
Kα radiation source. The source tension and current were 40
kV and 40 mA, respectively. Data were acquired with a scanning rate
of 2° min–1 in the scattering angle (2θ)
range of 10°–80°. The particle size, morphology,
and element mappings of the prepared powders were observed using a
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FEI, Quanta 200f) with
an EDS. The crystal orientation was detected with a TEM (JEM-2100f).
The surface chemical state of the as-prepared sample was investigated
by XPS (PHI Quantera). The specific surface area was measured by the
BET method. The nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed on
an Autosorb iQ analyzer.

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
To fabricate
the positive electrodes, the as-prepared materials were mixed with
acetylene black and polyvinylidene fluoride (8:1:1 by weight) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. The obtained slurry was then cast
onto an aluminum foil using a doctor blade and dried overnight at
80 °C in a vacuum oven. The foil coated by the materials was
punched out to be circular electrodes with 1.4 cm in diameter and
then roll-pressed before use. The electrode loadings were maintained
at ∼3.0 mg cm–2. For electrochemical tests,
the electrode was assembled into R2025 coin-type cells in an argon-filled
glovebox using Li metal as the anode. The electrolyte solution was
1 mol L–1 LiPF6 in an ethylene carbonate/dimethyl
carbonate mixture (1:1 ratio by volume). A Celgard 2400 membrane was
used as the separator. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests were
performed using a Land battery test system (Land CT2001A, Wuhan, China)
at different current densities from 20 mA g–1 (0.1
C) to 1000 mA g–1 (5 C) in a voltage range of 2–4.8
V (vs. Li+/Li). The constant current charge step at 0.1
C was followed by an additional constant voltage charge step until
the current density dropped to half of its initial value. The CV experiment
was carried out at a scan rate of 0.1 mV s–1 in
the range of 2–4.8 V using the CHI660C electrochemical workstation
(Chenhua, China). The EIS measurement was carried out using an IM6
electrochemical impedance analyzer with an ac perturbation signal
of 5 mV in the frequency range of 105 to 0.01 Hz.
