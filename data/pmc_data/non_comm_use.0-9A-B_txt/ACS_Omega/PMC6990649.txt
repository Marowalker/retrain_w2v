We report a series of titanium and
zirconium complexes supported
by dianionic amidophosphine–borane ligands, synthesized by
amine elimination and salt metathesis reactions. The TiIV complex [{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4Ti(NMe2)2] (1) was
obtained by the reaction between tetrakis-(dimethylamido)titanium(IV)
and the protic aminophosphine–borane ligand [{Ph2P(BH3)NH}2C6H4] (LH2) at ambient temperature. Both the heteroleptic zirconium
complexes—[η5-(C5H5)2Zr{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4] (2) and [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]ZrCl2] (3)—and the homoleptic zirconium complex [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]2Zr] (4) were obtained in good yield by the salt metathesis
reaction of either zirconocene dichloride [η5-(C5H5)2ZrCl2] or zirconium tetrachloride
with the dilithium salt of the ligand [{Ph2P(BH3)NLi}2C6H4] (LLi2),
which was prepared in situ. The molecular structures of the complexes 1, 2, and 4 in their solid states
were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Of these
complexes, only titanium complex 1 acts as an effective
catalyst for the facile hydroboration of terminal alkynes, yielding
exclusive E-isomers. The hydroboration of organic
nitriles yielded diborylamines with a broad substrate scope, including
broad functional group compatibility. The mechanism of hydroboration
occurs through the formation of titanium hydride as an active species.

Introduction
Catalytic hydroboration
of unsaturated bonds produces organoboron
compounds and their derivatives, including vinyl boronates, diborylamines,
and boronic esters, which act as powerful synthetic intermediates
in various organic1 and natural product
syntheses,2 as well as the foundation for
several chemical transformations in the pharmaceutical industry.3 Vinyl boronates are effectively used as synthons
in organic chemistry,4 in aldol reactions,5 in diverse coupling reactions; they are also
used as Michael donors.6 Diborylamines
and boronic esters can readily undergo hydrolysis to generate free
amines and alcohols, which are essential precursors to the production
of polyesters, dyes, and agrochemical as well as pharmaceutical compounds.7−10 The main advantage of organoboron compounds is that they are quite
stable and easy to handle. Hydroboration reactions are often atom-efficient.
Consequently, countless metal-catalyzed and metal-free procedures
have been developed to carry out the addition of boranes to unsaturated
bonds, such as organic alkynes, alkenes, carbonyl, and nitriles.11 Several research groups have reported the regioselective
and stereoselective hydroboration of alkynes and alkenes to produce
vinyl boronates and alkyl boronate, catalyzed by transition metals
such as Fe,12 Co,13 Cu,14 Ru,15 Rh, and Ir.16 Additionally, there are
some reports of hydroboration of carbonyl compounds affording boronic
esters, catalyzed by Co, Fe, and Ru.17−23 Main-group metal-catalyzed hydroboration of terminal alkynes and
organic nitriles is also well reported in the literature.24−29 Using commercially available aluminum hydride (iBu2AlH) and LiAlH4 or sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is a well-known means of reduction of alkynes and alkenes,
followed by aryl and alkyl nitriles.29 However,
these reagents are combustible and generate large amounts of inorganic
waste, which render the process unfavorable. Owing to an increasing
trend in adopting the use of earth-abundant metal catalysts in various
catalytic reactions, researchers across the world are exploring the
development of a mild synthetic process catalyzed by earth-abundant
metals with a wide substrate scope, possessing good functional group
tolerance and occurring within a short reaction time.

Modern
chemistry mainly deals with the use of nontoxic and earth-abundant
metals that are considered green and sustainable, in addition to being
economical and easily available.30−34 Recently, our research group has demonstrated the
chemoselective hydroboration of organic nitriles with pinacolborane
(HBpin) and catecholborane (HBcat), catalyzed by an alkyl aluminum
complex,35 but the scope of the precatalyst
was limited. This prompted us to explore the hydroboration of a variety
of C–X (X = C, N) multiple bonds, catalyzed by another earth-abundant
group 4 metal—titanium. Although Smith et al. and Hartwig et
al. have already reported the titanium-mediated borylation of olefin,
such catalytic reactions usually have a very limited substrate scope.36−38 Srebnik et al. have also reported the hydroboration of alkynes with
HBpin, catalyzed by zirconocene chloride hydride.39 Our research group has already succeeded in the synthesis
of a series of mononuclear and dinuclear titanium complexes bearing
a bis(phosphinoselenoic amide) ligand that act as effective catalysts
for the hydroelementation of heterocumulenes under mild reaction conditions.40,41 This work induced us to synthesize a new class of aminophosphine–borane
ligands and introduce them to group 4 metal chemistry, to utilize
the chelating behavior of aminophosphine–borane ligands in
homogeneous catalysis and apply it in group 4 metal chemistry. These
metal amidophosphine–borane complexes can manipulate their
interactions with the metal centers, thus making them very interesting
to use in various synthetic protocols.

Here, we report the synthesis
of group 4 metal complexes using
aminophosphine–borane ligands and explore their catalytic efficiency
in the hydroboration of alkynes and nitriles with HBpin under mild
conditions to yield the corresponding (E)-alkenyl
boranes and diborylamines as exclusive products (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Catalytic reduction of
alkynes and nitriles to alkenes and primary
amines, respectively.

Results and Discussion
The preparation of catalysts was carried out using a borane derivative
of the aminophosphine ligand (L1-H2), which was synthesized
by the reaction between N,N′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-benzene-1,2-diamine
[Ph2PNHC6H4NH-PPh2] and
dimethyl sulfide borane complex in a 1:2 molar ratio in toluene (Tol)
at room temperature (rt).42,43 The titanium complex,
with the molecular formula [{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4Ti(NMe2)2]
(1) was synthesized utilizing a convenient method, in
which the ligand L1-H2 was treated with tetrakis(dimethylamido)
titanium(IV) in a 1:1 molar ratio in toluene at room temperature (Scheme 1). In contrast, the
reaction of anhydrous zirconocene dichloride (Cp2ZrCl2) with dianionic lithium salt [{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]Li2(THF)4 afforded the corresponding bis-cyclopentadienyl zirconium
complex [Cp2Zr{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4] (2) in good yield with the
elimination of 2 equiv of lithium chloride (Scheme 1). The heteroleptic zirconium dichloride
complex [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]ZrCl2] (3) and homoleptic zirconium
complex [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]2Zr] (4) were isolated in good
yield through the one-pot treatment of ligand L1-H2 and
lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide [LiN(SiMe3)2] with ZrCl4 in a 1:2:1 and 2:4:1 molar ratio, respectively,
in toluene at 70 °C, which also generated LiCl as precipitate
(Scheme 1). All of
the new Ti and Zr complexes, 1–4,
were fully characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and elemental
analyses. The solid-state structures of complexes 1, 2, and 4 were affirmed by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction analysis. However, good-quality crystals of complex 3 were not obtained and therefore, the data recorded were
poor.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Titanium (Complex 1) and Zirconium
Complexes
(Complexes 2–4) from L1-H2
In complexes 1–4, the absence
of a resonance signal at δH 4.84 ppm, assigned to
−NH protons for the free ligand, confirmed the formation of
fragments of the dianionic ligand L1 [Figures S5, S9, S13, and S17 in the Supporting Information
(SI)]. Additionally, the characteristic singlet resonance at δH 3.21 ppm confirmed the presence of two dimethylamido groups
[−N(CH3)2] in complex 1 and
resonances of the cyclopentadienyl protons in complex 3 appeared at δH 6.00 ppm as a sharp singlet, indicating
identical chemical environments for the two cyclopentadienyl rings
(Figures S5 and S9 in the SI). Likewise,
in the 31P{1H} NMR spectral data, the complexes
exhibited sharp signals at δP 74.1 ppm (complex 1), 69.8 ppm (complex 2), 66.5 ppm (complex 3), and 66.9 (complex 4) ppm, which are fundamentally
low-field-shifted when contrasted to the signal of the free ligand L1-H2 (δP 56.8 ppm) (Figures S7, S11, S15, and S19 in the SI). In the 11B{1H} NMR spectra, a broad doublet signal centered at
δB −34.9 (complex 1), −35.2
(complex 2), −34.9 (complex 3), and
−35.1 (complex 4) ppm was observed, which was
in the range (−35.4 ppm) similar to that of the starting material L1-H2 (Figures S6, S10, S14, and S18 in the SI).

Single crystals of complexes 1, 2, and 4 were analyzed by X-ray diffraction.
The crystals were isolated
from the concentrated toluene solution of the corresponding complex
at −35 °C. The solid-state structures of the complexes
are consistent with their observed solution-phase behavior. The molecular
structures of complexes 1, 2, and 4 are shown in Figures 2, 3, and 4,
respectively, and the details of the single-crystal X-ray data and
structure refinement parameters for complexes 1, 2, and 4 are provided in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. Titanium complex 1 crystallizes in the monoclinic space assembly P21/c, with four molecules in the unit
cell. The coordination polyhedron is formed by the chelation of ligand L1, which is bonded to the TiIV metal ion through
two amido nitrogen atoms. Additionally, two dimethylamido groups are
attached to the TiIV ion to adopt a distorted tetrahedral
geometry. A distance of 2.284 Å (Ti–H2a) was observed
between the B–H hydrogen atom and the TiIV metal
ion of complex 1, presumably due to crystal packing (Figure 2). However, in the 1H NMR spectra, all of the BH3 protons exhibited
at δH 2.11 ppm, indicating that both the borane groups
are chemically equivalent in complex 1.

Zirconium complex 2 crystallizes in
the triclinic
space group P1̅, with four molecules in the
unit cell. Complex 2 is monomeric, and the coordination
polyhedron is formed by the chelation of two amido nitrogen atoms
of the dianionic ligand L1, along with η5-coordination
of two cyclopentadienyl moieties to the ZrIV ion, adopting
an tetrahedral geometry (Figure 3). Since the radius of the Zr(IV) ion is greater than
that of the Ti(IV) ion, the Zr–N distances [2.287(19) and 2.207(19)
Å] in complex 2 are slightly longer than the Ti–N
distances in complex 1; however, they are in full agreement
with the Zr–N covalent bond distances reported in the literature.44b Both the Zr–C(Cp) distances [Zr1–C39
is 2.527(3) Å and Zr1–C33 is 2.536(3) Å] are within
the range of Zr–C(Cp) distances reported for other zirconocene
complexes.44

The homoleptic zirconium
complex 4 crystallizes in
the monoclinic space group P21/c with four independent molecules in the unit cell. The
Zr center is chelated by four amido nitrogen atoms of the two dianionic
ligands L1. The geometry around the zirconium ion can
be described as a distorted tetrahedral (Figure 4). Similar to complex 1, short
distances of 2.324 Å (Zr–H4a) and 2.377 Å (Zr–H3c)
are observed between the B–H hydrogen atoms and the ZrIV metal ion, presumably due to crystal packing (Figure 2). However, in the 1H NMR spectra, all of the BH3 protons exhibited at δH 1.94 ppm, indicating that all of the borane groups are chemically
equivalent in complex 4.

Catalytic Hydroboration
of Alkynes and Nitriles
First,
the reaction conditions were optimized using phenylacetylene and benzonitrile
as model substrates for alkyne hydroboration and nitrile hydroboration,
respectively, with HBpin in the presence of all of the catalysts,
complexes 1–4. Table 1 contains a summary of all of the results.
Control reactions were performed without a catalyst, and we observed
no traces of the product (Table 1, entry 1). Initial hydroboration was carried out with
1 mol % loading of complex 1, and it was observed that
the reaction of phenylacetylene with 1.1 equiv of HBpin, either in
toluene as a solvent or in neat condition, yielded 99% of the (E)-alkenyl borane product (5a) at room temperature
in only 1 h (Table 1, entries 2 and 3).

a The yield was calculated using 1H NMR (400 MHz) integration
of a characteristic product signal
present in the reaction mixture using hexamethylbenzene (HMB) (10
mol %) as an internal standard.

After preliminary evaluation of the catalysts for hydroboration
of alkynes, we concluded that titanium catalyst 1 is
substantially more efficient than analogs of zirconium complexes (2–4). The labile titanium amido bond in
catalyst 1 allows the facile formation of metal hydride,
which can act effectively to catalyze the hydroboration of the unsaturated
C–X bond. However, the use of other solvents such as tetrahydrofuran
(THF) and hexane (Hex) resulted in a drastic decrease in the formation
of alkenyl boranes (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). Additionally, reduction of the amount
of catalyst (0.5 mol %) for the same reaction furnished a lower yield
(Table 1, entry 9).
Thus, based on the above observations, to achieve maximum efficiency
within a short period, we decided to use 1.1 equiv of HBpin for the
hydroboration reaction of alkynes by loading 1 mol % of catalyst 1 using toluene as the solvent at room temperature.

In contrast, the hydroboration reaction of organic nitriles did
not proceed smoothly at room temperature with 1 equiv of HBpin in
toluene (Table S2, entry 2, SI). However,
when the same reaction was carried out using 1 equiv of benzonitrile
(PhCN) with 2.2 equiv of HBpin in neat condition at 1 mol % catalyst
loading under an elevated temperature (60 °C), a greater yield
(99%) of diborylamine (Table S2, entry
3, in SI) was achieved within 2 h of reaction time. A solvent-free
approach, as well as using an earth-abundant and inexpensive metal
as the catalyst for the hydroboration of organic alkynes and nitriles,
not only simplifies the experimental reaction but also reduces the
amount of waste which, in turn, decreases the environmental impact.
Thus, considering the importance of hydroboration reactions as intermediate
stages in several organic syntheses, this new atom-economic and sustainable
methodology would significantly change synthetic strategies for hydroboration,
compared to current expensive methods involving lanthanide, noble
metals, and group 1 and 2 metals.24,45,46 The titanium catalyst (complex 1) can
act as an effective catalyst for the facile hydroboration of terminal
alkynes and organic nitriles also, yielding (E)-alkenyl
boranes and diborylamines with a wide substrate scope, including broad
functional group compatibility.

With these optimized conditions,
we examined the scope of hydroboration
reactions of various terminal alkynes—bearing aryl, alkyl,
and heterocyclic groups—with HBpin, and the results are summarized
in Table 2. Terminal
alkynes with both electron-donating (p-tolyl-acetylene
or 1-ethynyl-4-methoxybenzene) and electron-withdrawing groups (bearing
fluoro, chloro, and bromo groups) were successfully converted to the
corresponding (E)-alkenyl boronates in excellent
yields within a period of 2 h (Table 2, entries 5b–g). In
each case, the quantum of the resulting (E)-alkenyl
borane product was calculated as an isolated yield. Several terminal
alkynes with cyclic substituents such as cyclopentylacetylene and
cyclohexyl-acetylene were compatible with this reaction and afforded
the desired products in good yield within 3 h (Table 2, entries 5h and 5i). Terminal alkynes bearing a heteroatom, such as 3-ethynylthiophene,
exhibited good tolerance and were converted to the corresponding product
smoothly (Table 2,
entry 5n). Additionally, aliphatic alkynes with longer
alkyl chains were also effectively converted to the corresponding
alkenyl boranes in excellent yields (Table 2, entries 5j–m). Therefore, this titanium-catalyzed hydroboration of alkynes demonstrated
complete regioselectivity by the exclusive formation of the E-isomer (Figures S25–S67 in the SI). In the case of aliphatic and cyclic alkynes, the yield
was calculated as NMR yield.

d Reaction conditions: catalyst 1 (1 mol %), alkynes

at rt.

Next, to explore
the efficiency of the titanium catalyst 1, we investigated
the hydroboration reactions of various
nitriles with HBpin, and representative results are summarized in Table 3. Aryl nitriles with
both electron-donating groups, such as −Me, −OMe, −SMe,
and tBu groups, and electron-withdrawing groups,
such as −F, −Cl, −Br, and −CF3 groups, afforded the desired diborylamine products in excellent
yield (95–99%) within 3 or 4 h at 60 °C (Table 3, entries 6b–i). Where alkyl nitriles were used as the substrates, the
hydroboration reaction proceeded at a higher rate and resulted in
the formation of [RCH2N(Bpin)2] in quantitative
yields (95–99%) within 1–3 h of reaction time (Table 3, entries 6l–n). To our delight, extension of the protocol
to nitriles bearing a heteroatom, such as 2-(thiophene-2-yr)acetonitrile,
demonstrated very good tolerance for thiophene moieties (99%, Table 3, entry 6o). Additionally, dinitriles could also be converted to the desired
diboryl product smoothly, with up to 91% yield in 10 h (Table 3, entry 6p). In
all cases, yields of the products were calculated from 1H NMR analysis using hexamethylbenzene (HMB) as an internal standard
(Figure S68–S118 in the SI).

Table 3 Titanium-Catalyzed Hydroboration of
Nitriles with HBpina
a Reaction conditions:
catalyst 1 (3 mol %), nitriles (1 equiv), HBpin (2.2
equiv), neat condition
at 60 °C; the yield was calculated by 1H NMR (400
MHz) integration of characteristic product signal present in the reaction
mixture with respect to HMB (15 mol %) as the internal standard.

Further, to check the chemoselectivity
of complex 1 for the hydroboration of alkynes and nitriles,
we treated 4-acetoxy
phenylacetylene and 4-acetoxy benzonitrile with HBpin—keeping
the ester moiety unperturbed in both cases—to exclusively obtain
the resulting products of hydroboration of the alkyne as well as nitrile
functionalities within 3–6 h of reaction time (Table 4, entries 5q and 6q; Figures S156–S160 in
the SI). Additionally, when a 1:1 mixture of 4-bromo-phenylacetylene
and 4-methyl styrene was used as the substrate in this reaction, the
hydroboration of the alkyne moiety proceeded selectively to give product 5g with a near-quantitative recovery of styrene (Table 4, entry 1). Similar
chemoselectivity was observed when a mixture of 1-ethynyl-4-methylbenzene
and 4-bromo-styrene or ethynylcyclohexane and 4-methoxy-styrene was
used under analogous reaction conditions (Table 4, entries 2 and 3; Figures S148–S153 in the SI). A similar result was also obtained
when 1-ethynylcyclohex-1-ene was used as the substrate in which the
catalyst selectively reduced the triple bond, while keeping the internal
double bond unperturbed (Table 4, entry 5p; Figures S154–S155 in the SI).

a Yield was calculated
by 1H NMR (400 MHz) integration of characteristic product

in toluene
at rt, nitriles (1 equiv), HBpin (2.2 equiv), neat condition at 60
°C; yield was calculated by 1H NMR (400 MHz) integration
of characteristic product signal present in the reaction mixture.

Further, we wanted to isolate
the end products of the catalytic
hydroboration of alkynes and nitriles. The alkenyl boranes underwent
rapid protonolysis with acetic acid at room temperature to form the
corresponding terminal olefins of high purity from terminal acetylenes
(Table 5, entries 7a–f; Figures S119–S130 in the SI). However, the diborylamines yielded a moderate quantity
of the corresponding substituted benzyl ammonium chloride upon protonolysis
in aqueous HCl (0.05 M) at room temperature (Table 6, entries 8a–c) (Figures S131–S136 in the SI).

Subjecting
1-deuterium-2-phenylacetylene and its methyl and bromo
derivatives (9a–c) to HBpin resulted
in the exclusive formation of the (Z)-vinyl boronate,
containing deuterium at the terminal carbon (Scheme 2). The proton resonance signals, at a chemical
shift of 6.07–6.1 ppm for complex 10a, 6.03–5.99
ppm for complex 10b, and 6.17–6.13 ppm for complex 10c, were absent in the 1H NMR spectra. The additional
singlet peak generated at 7.01 ppm confirmed the position of deuterium
at the phenyl-substituted terminal carbon (PhCH=CD) (Figures S137–S147 in the SI).

Scheme 2 Reaction
with Deuterium-Labeled Terminal Alkynes
The yield was calculated
by 1H NMR (400 MHz) integration of characteristic product
signal
present in the reaction mixture.

Three separate
control reactions were carried out using 4-methylphenylacetylene
and 4-triflurobenzonitrile with HBpin in the presence of only ligand L1 in set 1 and using Ti(NMe2)4 in sets
2 and 3. From the NMR spectra (Figures S161–S164 in the SI), it was observed that in the presence of only ligand L1-H2, even when higher loading (30 mol %) was used, no traces
of product were formed. However, hydroboration in the presence of
only Ti(NMe2)4 (10 mol %) yielded 48% conversion
of nitrile to diborylamine and 40% conversion of alkyne to alkenyl
boranes in 15 h. The pyrophoric nature of the Ti(NMe2)4 is considered a major disadvantage for its use as a catalyst
(Figures S165–S171 in the SI). A
control reaction was also carried out for the hydroboration of thiophenecarbonitrile
with HBpin in the presence of only Ti(NMe2)4 (10 mol %) in toluene, which also showed no traces of a product
being formed (Figures S172–S173 in
the SI).

Based on previous reports in the literature and experimental
results,47,48 the most plausible mechanism for the catalytic
hydroboration of
alkynes and nitriles with HBpin is shown in Schemes 3 and S1 (Supporting
Information), respectively. Initially, the titanium precatalyst 1 reacts with HBpin to form the active titanium hydride species
(I). Attempts to isolate the intermediates generated and their characterization
through crystallization were unsuccessful. However, this step is well
known in the literature.49,50 The titanium hydride
species further reacts with the alkynes and nitriles and affords the
corresponding metal alkenyl species (III) and metal imine species
(A and B in the SI) via sigma bond metathesis.
In the case of hydroboration of alkynes, the titanium alkene species
(III) reacts with another molecule of HBpin to yield alkenyl boronate
esters. In the next step, the active titanium hydride species is regenerated
and takes part in the catalytic cycle. However, in the case of hydroboration
of nitriles, the metal imine complex (B) reacts with another molecule
of HBpin to form a four-membered species (C), which eventually rearranges
itself to yield boryl amine (D). In the next step, the boryl amine
D reacts with another HBpin molecule to afford the diborylamine titanium
species (E). In the final step, the active titanium hydride species
is regenerated by emitting the corresponding free diborylamine product.

Alkynes with HBpin
Conclusions
In
summary, in this paper, we have demonstrated the synthesis,
structure, and catalytic application of titanium and zirconium complexes
of the amidophosphine–borane ligand. TiIV complex
[{Ph2P(BH3)-N}2C6H4Ti(NMe2)2] (1), mixed bis-cyclopentadienyl
amidophosphine–borane zirconium complex [η5-(C5H5)2Zr{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4] (2), zirconium dichloride complex [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]ZrCl2] (3), and homoleptic zirconium complex [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]2Zr]
(4) were prepared in excellent yields, and the solid-state
molecular structures of complexes 1, 2,
and 4 were established. Among these complexes, the TiIV complex 1 was found to be a competent catalyst
for the alkyne hydroboration of a large number of alkynes with different
functional groups and afforded the corresponding (E)-alkenyl boronate esters with a high degree of chemoselectivity
at ambient temperature. Additionally, complex 1 effectively
catalyzed the chemoselective hydroboration of organic nitriles to
yield N,N-diborylamines with a broad
substrate scope, having both aliphatic and aromatic nitriles, in short
reaction times.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Procedures
All manipulations involving
air- and moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out under argon
using the standard Schlenk technique or an argon-filled glovebox.
CDCl3 was distilled and stored in the glovebox. 1H NMR (400 MHz), 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz), 31P{1H} NMR (161.9 MHz), 11B{1H} (128.3 MHz), and 19F (376 MHz) spectra were measured
on a Bruker AVANCE III-400 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed
on a Bruker EURO EA at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad.
All of the starting materials, including o-phenylenediamine,
chlorodiphenylphosphine, tetrakisdimethylamido titanium(IV), zirconocene
dichloride [(C5H5)2ZrCl2], zirconium tetrachloride, and alkynes, as well as organic nitriles
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India, and used without further
purification, and boranes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, India,
and distilled before being used. The starting materials, 2-ethynyl
anisole, methyl 4-ethynylbenzoate, phenylacetylene-d, 4-methylphenylacetylene-d, and 4-bromophenylacetylene-d, were synthesized according
to procedures published in the literature.49

Preparation of Ligand [{Ph2P(BH3)NH}2C6H4] (L1-H2)
To a solution
of o-phenylenediamine (616 mg, 5.7
mmol) and triethylamine (1.09 g, 1.56 mL, 11.4 mmol) being stirred
in a THF/CH2Cl2 mixture, a solution of chlorodiphenylphosphine
(2 mL, 11.4 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added dropwise, and the reaction
mixture was stirred for another 3 h. The precipitate was filtered,
and the solvent was removed in vacuo. To this residue, 20 mL of dry
toluene and 2 equiv of borane dimethyl sulfide (1.2 mL, 11.4 mmol)
were added and stirred for a further 12 h. The title compound was
formed as a white precipitate. It was purified by washing several
times with n-hexane. Crystals suitable for X-ray
diffraction analysis were obtained from THF/n-pentane
combination in a 1:2 ratio. The title compound [{Ph2P(BH3)NH}2C6H4] (1-H2) is soluble in CDCl3, CH2Cl2, THF,
and toluene. The compound 1-H2 was recrystallized from hot toluene.

Preparation of Complex [[{Ph2P(BH3)N}2C6H4]Ti(H)2]
Complex 1 (0.123 mmol) was placed in a 25 mL dry Schlenk flask, to
which a solution of 2 equiv of HBpin (0.246 mmol) and 5 mL of toluene
was added. We decided to perform the reaction with 2 equiv of HBpin
to avoid overlapping signals, as additional equivalents of HBpin could
enter the additional titanium core centers. Then, the reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After that, the color of
the solution faded. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to obtain
a light yellow residue, which was washed twice with n-hexane (2 × 5 mL) to remove excess HBpin. The title compound
was recrystallized from toluene at −35 °C. Yield: (85
mg, 0.153 mmol) (92%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6): δH = 7.30–7.27 (m, 1H, ArH), 7.25–7.19 (m, 5H, ArH), 7.18–7.14

(s, 3H, BH3), 1.26 (s, 12H, CH3) ppm; 13C NMR (100 MHz, C6D6): δC = 137.7, 129.2, 128.4, 28.2, 127.9,
127.7, 125.6, 82.1, 36.4, 24.8, 21.4 ppm; 31P NMR (161.9
MHz, C6D6): δP = 69.3 ppm; 11B NMR (128.4 MHz, C6D6): δB = 24.2, −36.5 ppm. However, a satisfactory elemental
analysis could not be performed due to high oxygen and moisture sensitivity
of the complex.

General Procedure for Hydroboration of Terminal
Alkynes 5a–q
Catalyst 1 (1
mol %) was placed in a Schlenk tube, to which alkynes (1.0 mmol) as
well as HBpin (1.1 mmol) were added inside a glovebox. After this,
toluene (0.25 mL, in the case of the solid substrate) was added to
the reaction mixture and the Schlenk tube was allowed to be stirred
at room temperature for 1 h under an inert atmosphere. The products
were isolated by washing with a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane
(02:98) as eluent.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Compounds 6a–q
Catalyst 1 (3
mol %),
nitriles (1 mmol), and HBpin (2.2 mmol) were placed in a 25 mL Schlenk
flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar inside a glovebox. The reaction
mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 1–8 h depending on the
nature of the starting materials. The progress of the reaction was
monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy using hexamethylbenzene
(15 mol %) as an internal standard. After the reaction was completed,
excess HBpin was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain the desired
compounds.

X-ray Crystallographic Analyses
Single crystals of
complexes 1, 2, and 4 were
grown from a concentrated solution of toluene at −35 °C.
A crystal of suitable dimensions of complexes 1, 2, and 4 was mounted on a CryoLoop (Hampton Research
Corp.) with a layer of light mineral oil. Crystals of complexes 1, 2, and 4 were measured at 150
K. All measurements were recorded on a Rigaku SuperNova X-calibur
Eos CCD detector with graphite monochromatic Cu Kα (1.54184
Å) radiation. Crystal data and structure refinement parameters
of complexes 1, 2, and 4 are
summarized in Table S1. The structures
were solved by direct methods (SIR2004)50 and refined on F2 by full-matrix least-squares
methods, using SHELXL-2016/6.51 Nonhydrogen
atoms were anisotropically refined. H-atoms were included in the refinement
on calculated positions riding on their carrier atoms. The function
minimized was [∑w(Fo2 – Fc2)2] (w = 1/[σ2(Fo2) + (aP)2 + bP]), where P = (Max(Fo2,0) + 2Fc2)/3 with σ2(Fo2) from counting statistics. The functions R1 and wR2 were (∑||Fo| – |Fc||)/∑|Fo| and [∑w(Fo2 – Fc2)2/∑(wFo4)]1/2, respectively. The ORTEP-3 program was used to draw the
molecules of complexes 1, 2, and 4. Crystallographic data (excluding structure factors) for the structures
reported in this paper have been deposited with the Cambridge Crystallographic
Data Centre as supplementary publication no. CCDC 1903181 (complex 1), 1917671 (complex 2), and 1917672 (complex 4). Copies of the data can be obtained free of charge on application
