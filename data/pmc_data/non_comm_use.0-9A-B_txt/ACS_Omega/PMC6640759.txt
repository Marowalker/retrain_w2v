Atomic resolution of molecules has
been achieved using noncontact
atomic force microscopy (AFM) with the key step to functionalize the
tip apex by attaching suitable molecules so as to achieve high spatial
resolution through a sharper tip. A few molecular terminations have
been explored theoretically and experimentally, and they exhibit various
imaging behaviors. Here, we explore the influence of the structures
and chemical compositions of various molecular candidates as tips
on the contrast of AFM images by a first principles approach. Our
results reveal that the two end atoms of a linear molecule terminating
nearest the sample dominate the imaging behaviors, for example, atomic
resolution, sharpness, distortion, and so forth, whereas the symmetry
of the termination plays an important role in the distortion of AFM
images. These findings suggest that new tip terminations can be engineered
by decoupling the three end atoms responsible for imaging behaviors
from the tip structure behind them, which is attached to the macro
tip apex.

1 Introduction
In scanning probe microscopy,
it is commonly known that the structure
and atomic compositions of the tip apex have a significant influence
on the spatial resolution of the image. Particularly, CO functionalization
is a key step for noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM) to achieve
remarkable atomic resolution for planar molecules.1 This technique has achieved great progress in the past
few years.2−11 For example, it has been reported that carbon–carbon bond
orders within polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fullerenes can
be distinguished.11 The intricate chemical
transformation of an individual molecule7 and even its subatomic resolution2,12,13 have been directly imaged.

Recently, numerous
studies have paid attention to how a tip affects
the image contrast in AFM measurements. For example, it was proposed
that the sharp resolution originates from the ridge between two minima
of the surface potential imaged by the flexible probe.14,15 It has been found that the metallic tip behind CO gives a minor
contribution to the AFM resolution,16 whereas
the next-to-last atom is important for the AFM imaging. For example,
O2, Cu3CuO, and CO tips present very different
imaging behaviors,1,17 where the metal–O tip
produces a blurry image compared with that of the CO tip, whereas
the theoretical image of an O2 tip yields an image in which
it is difficult to interpret the atomic skeleton. On the other hand,
a CH4 termination produces a simulated AFM image,16 which is similar to the experimental result
obtained by a pentacene tip with −CH termination,1 and an O-down-oriented naphthalene tetracarboxylic
diimide (NTCDI) tip can perform well in AFM imaging.18 More recently, the imaging behaviors of Br, Xe, Kr, and
NO terminations for AFM imaging have been examined experimentally,
and it was found that the Br tip is particularly useful because it
is much easier to prepare and well-suited for the lateral manipulation
of single molecules.19 These studies suggest
that exploring various molecular terminations is valuable.

In
this study, we systematically examine the imaging behaviors
of various molecular candidates as tips on the AFM contrast with a
first principles approach. For a linear molecule pointing perpendicularly
toward the sample surface, only the two end atoms are found to dominate
the ability for atomic resolution; in particular, CO2 and
SCO tips can perform as well as a CO tip. With an asymmetric molecule
termination, for example, a planar H2CO with CO pointing
toward the sample, dramatically distorted images are yielded depending
on the H···H orientations, indicating that the symmetry
of the molecular terminations plays an important role in the distortion
of AFM images.

2 Methodology
Our
simulations are based on a model we built that can well reproduce
the AFM images:20 it employs the Fritz
Haber Institute ab initio molecular simulations code package21 with an accurate atomic-centered basis set and
grid-based real-space integration of “tight” settings. The density functional theory (DFT) + vdW method
of Tkatchenko and Scheffler22 is applied
to account for the van der Waals interactions. The generalized gradient
approximation of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof23 is chosen for the exchange–correlation functional used in
the DFT calculations. The frequency shift (FS) profiles are calculated
by differentiating the corresponding interaction force according to , where f0 and k0 are the resonance frequency and the spring
constant of the macroscopic tip, respectively.24

In our simulations, the substrate is not included
because it yields
a nearly uniform background for various tip terminations. The tips
are oriented perpendicularly to the main plane of the planar sample
molecules, whereas in most of our calculations, the tip molecule is
allowed to tilt under the influence of lateral AFM forces. Because
the tip is flexible, we include a lateral spring constant k of the tip of 0.5 N/m when appropriate.20 Indeed, the lateral stiffness of different tips is quite
different, whereas the lateral spring constant is unknown, and there
are no corresponding experimental images. In this study, we mainly
discuss the difference in images obtained with rigid tips. The two-dimensional
(2D) maps are calculated by moving the tip over the sample molecule
on a lateral grid of x and y positions
with intervals of 0.2 Å in both directions.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 CO as the First Two End
Atoms
We
first study linear molecules/structures at the tip terminations. We
take pentacene as the benchmark sample molecule to be imaged because
it has been extensively studied in previous AFM studies.1,3,16 With tips of aligned Au2CO and linear molecules CO2 and SCO, FS line profiles
along the long axis of the pentacene molecule obtained with these
tips are shown in Figure 1a. Clearly, each of these tips yields five FS minima over
the hollow sites of the pentacene and two FS minima at both ends corresponding
to the halo observed around the sample molecule1 (similar to the blue halo around the molecule, which can
be seen in Figure 1d or 1e). Specifically, removing the metallic
part Au2 from the Au2CO tip is seen to have
little effect on the atomic-scale FS corrugation. This is understandable
because the Au2 yields only an attractive background because
of its relatively distant location far from the sample (distance larger
than 5 Å) and also because it weakly affects only the electronic
state of CO. More remarkably, FS profiles by CO2 and SCO
molecules are also very close to that of Au2CO. The four
tip terminations share a great similarity of the corrugation over
pentacene at the same scanning height, whereas the electronic structure
of the CO molecule, as is known, is remarkably different from the
−CO group bonding to the third atom, for example, O in CO2 or S in SCO.

long axis

and SCO (red) terminations. (b) Difference dFZ = FZbond – FZhollow between the interaction forces at the C–C

and the end atoms C and O are denoted by gray and red balls, respectively.
(d) and (e) 2D force patterns (red/blue = large/small repulsive force)
obtained with a CO2 termination, without and with accounting
for the tilting effect of the tip.

To further investigate the influence of tip compositions
behind
the two end atoms at various scanning heights, we introduce the interaction
force difference (dFZ) at different positions, for example, dFZ = FZbond – FZhollow, which is the difference between the forces
at the C–C bond of pentacene and at the hollow site obtained
by CO, Au2CO, CO2, and SCO tips, shown in Figure 1b. This difference
in force not only highlights the corrugation near the central C6 ring of pentacene observed with a specific tip termination
but also can be used to compare the corrugation evolution with different
terminations at increasing scanning height. As shown in Figure 1b, in general, the CO2 tip yields the smallest corrugation, and Au2CO and CO
yield the largest at the same scanning height. They all measure larger
repulsive forces at the C–C bond (dFZ > 0), indicating that the same contrast is imaged
by various X–CO tips at a given scanning height. When the scanning
height is larger than 3.8 Å, dFZ for the four tips decreases to zero and the contrast
corrugation vanishes. The dependence of the AFM contrast on the scanning
height of these tips agrees well with that of CO tip, which has been
experimentally and theoretically discussed in previous studies.1,16 In the following, we will simply discuss the images obtained at
a constant scanning height.

For a more global view, we show
in Figure 1d,e the
2D force patterns obtained with a
CO2 termination, without and with accounting for the tilting
effect of the tip due to the lateral AFM forces. Images for CO, Au2CO, and SCO tips are not shown because they are nearly identical
to those for CO2 tips, not only for atomic resolution but
also for distortions. Clearly, the CO2 termination can
image well the chemical structure of pentacene. By introducing the
tilting effect, the hexagonal C6 rings appear stretched
considerably along the short axis, closely consistent with the image
obtained with CO termination experimentally and theoretically.1,20 All of these findings suggest that compositions behind the two end
atoms of a linear termination have little influence on the imaging
behaviors, even if the electronic structures of the two end atoms
are modified.

3.2 Effect of the First End
Atom
For
a comprehensive exploration of the structures and chemical compositions
of the linear tip terminations on the AFM contrast, we test various
tip candidates for their imaging capability over NTCDI (shown in Figure 2a), which includes
O and N elements in addition to C and H. The end atom of a tip termination
can be C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl (not shown, identical to F), and Xe,
and the second and third (if present) end atoms are carefully chosen
to be linear molecules/groups. Generally speaking, most tips can image
the skeleton of the hexagonal C6 rings well, for example,
the central two C6 rings of NTCDI, because of their simple
ring structure. Nevertheless, the global contrast over NTCDI obtained
with these tips varies a lot. For a clear view, we show in Figure 2b,c the force line
profiles along the dashed black line marked in Figure 2a over the N and O atoms. The peaks of the
line profiles at atom positions can be used to evaluate the capability
of a tip to distinguish N and O atoms. Compared with the benchmark
of Au2CO tip, which shows three peaks of N and two peaks
of O atoms, Xe shows only a sharp peak at the N position, as shown
in Figure 2b, although
it enhanced the contrast of scanning tunneling microscopy19 and yields blurred but less distorted images
of other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For F, Si, P, S, and Cl
(not shown) atoms as the first end atom, similar to the Xe case, there
arises only one peak over the N atoms with shoulders over the O atoms,
suggesting that atomic resolution is not achieved. Here, the role
of the second end atom is not discussed because we cannot consider
all of the pairing possibilities. Because it is the two end atoms
that dominate the AFM contrast, we do not rule out the possibility
that some molecules terminated with F, Si, P, S, or Cl as the first
end atom may be able to produce good AFM images.

of NTCDI, where C, H, O, and N atoms are
shown in gray, white, red, and blue, respectively. (b) and (c) Force
line profiles along the black dashed line marked in (a) over the O
and N atoms with different tips at their appropriate scan heights.
For clarity, forces of different tips in (b) and (c) are added with
different values to separate the lines.

By contrast, with C, N, or O as the first end atom, force
line
profiles shown in Figure 2c suggest that HNC, HCN, CH3CN (linear three end
atoms), and CO2 terminations can perform as well as the
Au2CO tip. They yield three peaks over the N position and
two peaks over the O position, indicating the apparent identification
of O and N atoms, although the brightness of the N atom is slightly
weaker than that of O atoms. Impressively, a CH3CN tip
can perform as well as HCN, which not only confirms that the two end
atoms dominate the capability for AFM imaging but also suggests that
the chemical compositions behind the two end atoms can be carefully
chosen for attaching the metallic tip. This facilitates the design
of practically useful tip functionalizations for AFM.

3.3 Imaging Behaviors of −CN Tips
Considering that
few molecules are terminated by a C atom and −CO
tips have been widely studied, in the following, we focus on tips
with −CN as the two end atoms. For simplicity, linear HCN and
ClCN with H and more electronegative Cl as the third end atom are
chosen, pointing perpendicularly to the sample surface. The 2D patterns
of a pentacene sample obtained with HCN and ClCN are shown in Figure 3c,d in comparison
with that obtained by CO2 in Figure 3b. X–CN (X = H, Cl) tips exhibit well
the skeleton of the pentacene molecule, showing clearly the five hollows,
two brighter ends, and, to a lesser degree, the C–H bonds.1,20 Moreover, it is interesting that the pattern obtained with X–CN
seems to be less distorted than that obtained with X–CO. Comparing
the images in Figure 3b–d, which allow tip tilting by including a lateral spring
constant of 0.5 N/m, the central three hollows obtained with ClCN
are apparently less stretched along the short pentacene axis. For
the well-known chemical geometry of pentacene, the apparent increase
obtained with CO2 in the C–C bond lengths is up
to 70% from free pentacene, nearly identical to the distortion found
with CO tips,3,20 whereas that obtained with HCN
and ClCN is only around 45%.

C, H, and F are denoted by gray, white, and light blue balls, respectively.
The red crosses denote positions of the C–C bonds used to measure

and (h), at a tip height of 3.2 Å. Atom positions are marked
by circles in the 2D patterns.

To investigate the imaging behaviors of the X–CN tips
in
more detail, we use the sample molecule 4-(4-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenylethynyl)-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenylethynyl)
phenylethynylbenzene (FFPB),3,25 which has been used
to discuss the image distortions by CO termination reported by Moll
et al.26 FFPB has four phenyl rings connected
by ethynylene units (C≡C triple bonds), two of these phenyl
rings being H-terminated (H-ring) and the other two being F-terminated
(F-ring), as shown in Figure 3e. We show in Figure 3f–h the 2D patterns obtained with CO2, HCN,
and ClCN terminations, including the tilting effect at 3.2 Å
scanning height. Clearly, the three simulated images share great similarity:
the C≡C triple bonds are imaged as bright lines perpendicular
to the bond, and C–F can be resolved well, whereas C–H
cannot be resolved, which is in good agreement with the experimental
result obtained with CO termination. Because of the FFPB molecule
being free in our simulation, the H-rings and F-rings exhibit different
magnitudes of brightness, which is not so obvious in the image of
the experiment.26 We measure the image
distortion as the distance between the two apparent C–C bond
positions denoted with red crosses in Figure 3e: this distortion is given in Table 1 for different tip terminations.
In our simulation, the H-rings appear larger in diameter than the
F-rings, using a CO2 tip, which is consistent with the
report by Moll et al., using the CO tip.26 The HCN and ClCN tips also yield larger apparent H-rings than F-rings.
Compared with the well-known 2.42 Å distance between the midpoints
of opposite C–C bonds in phenyl rings, the H-ring is enlarged/contracted
by 6 and −2% with rigid X–CO (X = none or O) versus
X–CN (X = H or Cl), respectively, and by −9 and −15%
for the F-ring It appears that the X–CN tips indeed image the
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (carbon rings with H-terminations)
with less distortion than the X–CO tips.

3.4 Effect of the Molecule
Symmetry
So
far we have discussed linear molecules (including CH3CN
with three linear end atoms) as the AFM tip terminations, whereas
most molecular candidates are not linear. The two end atoms are indeed
crucial for the AFM imaging, whereas the symmetry of the tip molecule
(referencing to the sample) is also important, specifically for the
distortion of the AFM images. Here, we choose a planar H2CO molecule, with CO as the two end atoms pointing toward the sample
and two H atoms able to be in different orientations, either parallel
to the long axis of pentacene (αH2CO) or perpendicular
to it (βH2CO), as sketched in Figure 4a,b. The 2D patterns of pentacene obtained
by αH2CO and βH2CO tips are shown
in Figure 4c,d. Apparently,
while the chemical structures of the five C6 rings are
imaged, a remarkable difference in distortion arises: patterns of
the hollows obtained by αH2CO look stretched along
the long axis, whereas those for βH2CO are stretched
along the short axis. The dramatic visual impression comes mostly
from the shapes of the hollows (minimum areas), which are differently
distorted by αH2CO and βH2CO tips,
whereas the apparent lengths of pentacene (distance between the first
and sixth C–C bonds) by αH2CO is only 3% larger.
Distortion due to the orientations of the H···H in
H2CO is much more remarkable for the NTCDI sample, as shown
in Figure 4e,f, which
are obtained with αH2CO and βH2CO
for H···H parallel and perpendicular to the N···N
in NTCDI, respectively. Generally speaking, the image is stretched
along/perpendicular to the N···N orientation of NTCDI
by αH2CO/βH2CO. The apparent distance
between the two C–C bonds (marked by dashed arrows in Figure 4,d) imaged by αH2CO is 3% smaller than the chemical structure (4.87 vs 4.72
Å), whereas that imaged by βH2CO is around 3%
larger; the angle between the two apparent C–O bonds (marked
by the dashed angles) by αH2CO is 30% smaller than
the chemical structure (82° vs 116.4°), whereas that by
βH2CO is around 120°.

distance of C–C bonds and the blue dashed lines mark the angle
between the two apparent CO bonds. For clarity, only half of the atom
positions are marked by circles in the 2D patterns. Panels (c) and
(d) use the same length scale, which is different from panels (a)
and (b).

In our simulations, distortions
due to the symmetry of the molecule
terminations are always observed, which are mainly affected by the
third atoms (e.g., two H atoms in H2CO) behind the linear
two end atoms, whereas the influence of the fourth atoms (e.g., the
three H atoms in CH3CO) is small. Taking the third atoms
as a group in a plane parallel to the sample, generally images are
stretched along its long axis, whereas they are compressed along its
short axis. Nevertheless, the symmetry of the metallic tip, for example,
Cu clusters, behind CO hardly affects the distortion. Using a cluster
with three aligned Cu atoms as the third atoms parallel to the sample
and CO adsorbed at the middle Cu as the two end atoms pointing to
the sample, we find that different orientations of the three aligned
Cu atoms referenced to the sample induce little distortion of the
image compared with that obtained by an isolated CO tip. In this case,
the electronic structure of the end atoms does not change much, and
the metallic part only provides a weak asymmetric background.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have systematically explored
the AFM contrast
produced by various molecular candidates as AFM terminations. C, N,
and O as the first end atoms produce sharper images for adjacent atoms
than Si, P, and S, which suggests that atomic sizes are of great influence
on the capability for atomic resolutions. The second period light
element atoms as the first end atom in the inert molecule tips could
be favorable for high resolution AFM imaging. With linear molecules,
only
the two end atoms are found to dominate the imaging behaviors for
AFM imaging: in particular, SCO and CO2 can perform equally
to a CO termination, and the images obtained with HCN, ClCN, and CH3CN are nearly identical; however, the tips of NCF, CS2, and NP are found with difficulty to distinguish adjacent
atoms. Distortion of the image depends slightly on the atoms behind
the first two, whereas it varies a lot depending on the symmetry of
the tip termination. These findings suggest that new tip terminations
can be engineered by decoupling the three end atoms responsible for
imaging from the tip structure behind them, which is attached to the
macro tip apex.
