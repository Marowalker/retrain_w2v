A series of silica supported Pd (Pd/SiO2) catalysts
were prepared in various HCl concentrations (CHCl) of the impregnation solution with different electrostatic
interactions between Pd precursor and support, and their catalytic
properties were evaluated by the selective hydrogenation of nitrile
butadiene rubber (NBR). The results show that with the CHCl increasing from 0.1 to 5 M, the particle size of Pd
nanoparticles dramatically decreases from 24.2 to 5.1 nm and stabilizes
at ∼5 nm when CHCl is higher than
2 M. Using the catalysts prepared with a high CHCl (>2 M), an excellent hydrogenation degree (HD) of ∼94%
with 100% selectivity to C=C can be acquired under mild conditions.
Interestingly, the HD could be remarkably increased from 65 to 92%
by increasing only CCl– from 0.1 to 2 M with the addition of NaCl while keeping CH+ at 0.1 M. This is because
PdCl42– is the predominant existing form
of precursor at high CCl–, which has a strong electrostatic attraction with the positively
charged support favorable for the formation of small-sized Pd nanoparticles
over silica. Notably, Pd leaching behavior during the hydrogenation
reaction is closely related to CH+, and the higher the CH+, the less Pd residues are detected in the
hydrogenated NBR. Our contribution is to provide a facile strategy
to synthesize effective and stable Pd/SiO2 catalysts via
adjusting the electrostatic interaction, which exhibits a high activity
and selectivity for NBR hydrogenation.

1 Introduction
Nitrile butadiene rubber
(NBR) has been widely applied as an oil-resistant
rubber, adhesives, coatings, plastics modifiers, and so forth because
of its high strength and excellent oil resistance and elastic properties.1−3 However, due to the presence of C=C double bonds, NBR suffers
from low weather resistance and poor aging properties, which limits
its applications in harsh conditions. Therefore, the selective reduction
of C=C groups while retaining the nitrile groups (−CN)
in the rubber to produce high value-added hydrogenated NBR (HNBR)
is of great importance and necessity to improve the properties and
extend its applications, which has been increasingly attracting the
attention of academic and industry researchers.4−8

Nowadays, the main process for the production
of HNBR in industry
is solution hydrogenation, including homogenous and heterogeneous
hydrogenation.9 In a homogeneous system,
the reaction occurs at milder operation conditions and without any
diffusion problems,10−15 however, the removal of noble catalysts from HNBR is quite difficult
and the residual catalysts in HNBR can accelerate its aging and degradation.16,17 Compared with the homogeneous method, the heterogeneous system has
received high attention as an alternative in the past few decades
due to its facile catalyst recovery and recyclability, and the heterogeneous
hydrogenation of NBR to HNBR has a great value both in research and
in reality.18,19 According to the literature,20,21 the silica supported Pd catalyst is regarded as one of the most
widely explored heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of NBR.
Among all kinds of preparation methods for the supported catalysts,
the impregnation method is considered to be the most simple and universal
method and quite suitable for a large-scale production, which has
been widely used in commercial applications. But unfortunately, poor
catalyst dispersion is often found with the traditional incipient
wetness impregnation method due to the weak binding force between
the metal and the support, which will lead to low catalytic activity
and leaching of active components from the support during reactions.
Therefore, how to improve the interaction between the Pd precursor
and the silica support is significantly important for the preparation
of stable and highly dispersed supported Pd catalysts.

de Jong
and co-workers22 have reviewed
the synthesis of supported Pd catalysts with different kinds of supports
and indicated that the charges of Pd precursors and supports were
important properties during synthesis, affecting both dispersion and
distribution of Pd over the support. Li et al.23 demonstrated that PdCl2 as the precursor was
better than Pd(NO3)2 and Pd(OAc)2 and the Cl addition had a remarkable influence on the particle size,
reduction behavior, and catalytic performance of the Pd–Re
catalyst in glycerol hydrogenolysis. Recently, Wong and co-workers24 proposed a simple and generalizable method to
produce highly dispersed and ultrasmall (∼1 nm) bimetallic
nanoparticles based on strong electrostatic adsorption. It is well
accepted that the size and dispersion of the deposited active metal
particles are strongly dependent on the metal–support interaction,
which is closely related to the existing forms of metal precursors
and support surface properties.25,26 Therefore, how to adjust
the electrostatic interaction is significant but the effect of impregnation
solution properties (e.g., the concentrations of H+ (CH+) and Cl– (CCl–))
on the particle size, dispersion, and stability of the Pd/SiO2 catalyst are rarely reported and their effect on NBR hydrogenation
is still unknown to the best of our knowledge.

Herein, a series
of silica supported Pd (Pd/SiO2) catalysts
have been prepared in various HCl concentrations (CHCl) via the incipient wetting impregnation method and
the individual and combined effects of CH+ and CCl– on catalyst properties and catalytic performance
in NBR hydrogenation are systematically investigated. As illustrated
in Scheme 1, CCl– mainly affects
the existing forms of Pd(II) ion coordination, and PdCl42– exists primarily in solution when CCl– is higher than 2 M, which
is the most utilized negatively charged palladium complex ion and
is stable in acid solutions. CH+ has an effect on the surface charge density of silica
and subsequently affects the interaction between the Pd precursor
and the support. The high concentrations of H+ and Cl– could significantly improve the dispersion and distribution
of Pd nanoparticles over silica and enhance the catalytic activity
and also effectively decrease Pd leaching during the NBR hydrogenation
reaction.

and the Silica
Support at Various CHCl
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of CHCl on the Particle Size
and Distribution of Catalysts
Figure 1 shows X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of catalysts prepared with various CHCl at different states: before calcination (Figure 1A), before reduction
(Figure 1B), and after
reduction (Figure 1C). All the samples exhibit a wide peak around 22°, which is
a reflection of the typical amorphous silica structure. Notably, there
is a weak peak at 2θ of 40° for Pd2+/SiO2-0.1 before calcination (Figure 1A), corresponding to the (140) diffraction
of PdCl2, which is not observed in other samples of Pd2+/SiO2-x (x =
0.3, 1, 2, 4, and 5 M). It is indicated that the Pd precursor has
a poor adhesion to the support when CHCl of impregnation solution is as low as 0.1 M, which may lead to the
severe aggregation of active components during the subsequent calcination
and reduction process.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of Pd2+/SiO2-x samples before calcination (A), PdO/SiO2-x samples after calcination (B), and Pd/SiO2-x samples after reduction (C), where x represents
various CHCl in the preparation process:
(a) 0.1 M; (b) 0.3 M; (c) 1 M; (d) 2 M; (e) 4 M; and (f) 5 M.

The XRD patterns of PdO/SiO2-x catalysts
(Figure 1B) exhibit
five diffraction peaks, representing (101), (110), (112), (103), and
(211) planes of PdO nanoparticles. The full width at half maximum
of the strongest characteristic reflection (101) is used to estimate
the average crystallite size of PdO nanoparticles according to the
Scherrer equation27 and the results are
listed in Table 1.
The particle size of PdO gradually decreases from 13.3 to 6.2 nm with
the increase in CHCl from 0.1 to 5 M.
After reduction, Pd/SiO2-x catalysts show
different diffraction peaks at 2θ = 40, 46, 68, and 82°
assigned to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of Pd nanoparticles,
respectively (Figure 1C).28 The average Pd particle sizes are
calculated from the Pd(111) peak by the Scherrer equation and are
also shown in Table 1. It is noteworthy that with the increase in CHCl from 0.1 to 2 M, the Pd particle size dramatically decreases
from 24.2 to 5.6 nm, but further increase in CHCl to 5 M leads to almost no change in the particle size.
In combination with the results obtained for PdO/SiO2-x, it is interesting to find that the particle size changes
differently before and after reduction. When CHCl is lower than 1 M, the particle size in the reduced state
is larger than that in the oxidized state and the lower CHCl, the larger particle size can be acquired after reduction
(Pd particle size is nearly twice larger than that before reduction
when CHCl is 0.1 M). Whereas the opposite
phenomenon is observed when CHCl is higher
than 2 M and the Pd particle size is stabilized at ∼5 nm with
further increase in CHCl. This might be
related to the different binding force between the Pd precursor and
the support. If the interaction of the Pd precursor and the support
is weak, the calcination and reduction processes will induce reaggregation
of active components, nevertheless, the reduction process will help
in the redispersion of Pd particles over silica, if strong interactions
exist between the metal and the support.

and the (111) peak for Pd, and θ is the Bragg angle.

The morphology and dispersion of
Pd/SiO2-x prepared in various CHCl of impregnation
solution were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
(Figure 2) and the
particle size distributions were obtained by counting more than 100
particles from TEM images (insets of Figure 2). When CHCl is
very low (0.1 M), large Pd particles with severe aggregation in some
areas can be observed in Pd/SiO2-0.1, inducing a wide particle
size distribution as shown in the inset of Figure 2a. With the increase of CHCl to 0.3–1 M, the particle dispersion is improved
but the average particle size is still large, ca. 10 nm (Figure 2b,c). When CHCl is further increased to 2–5 M, Pd
particles are uniform and dispersed well with the narrow particle
size distribution centered at 5–6 nm (Figure 2d–f).

To investigate the interaction
between the metal and the support,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out for PdO and
Pd/SiO2-x (x = 0.1, 1,
2, and 5 M) catalysts as shown in Figure 3. Pd 3d spectra present two sets of doublet
peaks corresponding to Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2, respectively, and the binding energies (BEs) of PdII 3d3/2 and PdII 3d5/2, or Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 for the tested PdO or Pd/SiO2-x catalysts (x = 0.1, 1,
2, and 5 M) are shown in Table 2. The BE of PdII 3d5/2 for free PdO
is measured to be 337.1 eV as reported in the literature.29 It is clear from Table 2 that the BEs of PdII 3d5/2 for PdO/SiO2-x (x =
0.1, 1, 2, and 5 M) are 337.02, 337.01, 336.98, and 336.67 eV, respectively,
which shift to lower BEs by 0.08, 0.09, 0.12, and 0.43 eV, respectively,
in comparison with 337.1 eV (the BE of PdII 3d5/2 in free PdO as a standard). The negative shift is caused by the
electron donation from the support to PdII, and the shift
is greater as CHCl is higher, implying
the existence of strong coordination between PdII and the
support at high CHCl. To further verify
the metal–support interaction and detect the surface electronic
properties of the final catalysts, XPS results for Pd/SiO2-x (x = 0.1, 1, 2, and 5 M) catalysts
are also provided in Table 2. It is shown that the BEs of Pd 3d3/2 and Pd 3d5/2 also have a slightly negative shift with an increase in CHCl from 0.1 to 5 M, indicating more electron
donation from the support to Pd and the stronger metal–support
interaction. The transfer of electrons from the support to the Pd
metal is beneficial for Pd to provide sufficient feedback electrons
to the C=C antibonding orbital, thus enhancing the activation
of the C=C double bonds of NBR.

It can be clearly seen that CHCl could
significantly affect the particle size and dispersion of Pd nanoparticle
over silica and with the increase of CHCl, the Pd particle sizes become smaller and the dispersion is better
obviously. XPS result also confirms that the electrostatic interaction
between the metal and the support is enhanced as CHCl is increased. The characterization of XRD and TEM
gives a consistent result that when CHCl is higher than 2 M, the particle size can be stabilized at 5–6
nm for Pd/SiO2-x (x =
2, 4, 5), but actually, the binding force of Pd with the support is
different from each other as revealed by XPS. Pd/SiO2-5
has a larger negative shift of BEs than Pd/SiO2-2, indicating
that the electrostatic interaction between Pd and the support is continuously
strengthened as CHCl increases from 2
to 5 M, although the Pd particle size has almost no change.

2.2 Effect of CHCl on the Adsorption
and Catalytic Performance of Pd/SiO2 Catalysts in NBR Hydrogenation
Figure 4 displays
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of SiO2, Pd/SiO2-0.1, and Pd/SiO2-2 after dipping in NBR solution for 2 h. It is clear that
Pd/SiO2-0.1 and Pd/SiO2-2 exhibit a new adsorption
peak at 2236 cm–1 assigned to the stretching vibration
of −CN, indicating that Pd catalysts can effectively adsorb
NBR macromolecules but the support itself has almost no adsorption
of NBR. It is worth noting that the peak intensity of the −CN
stretching vibration for Pd/SiO2-2 is relatively stronger
than that for Pd/SiO2-0.1, suggesting that there are more
NBR macromolecules adsorbed on Pd/SiO2-2. This is probably
because Pd/SiO2-2 has a smaller Pd particle size compared
with Pd/SiO2-0.1, and thus has more exposed active sites
under the identical Pd loadings resulting in more NBR macromolecules
adsorbed on the catalyst.

Figure 4 FT-IR spectra for the SiO2, Pd/SiO2-0.1,
and Pd/SiO2-2 after absorption of NBR molecules.

Figure 5 shows the
FT-IR spectra of NBR and HNBR (Figure 5a–f) obtained by the selective hydrogenation
of NBR using Pd/SiO2-x as catalysts, and
the HD values can be calculated by IR spectrophotometric method and
are also listed in Figure 5. In the spectrum of NBR, six primary peaks at 2928, 2857,
2236, 1463, 970, and 920 cm–1 can be observed, and
ascribed to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of −CH2–, the vibration of the cyano group (−CN), the
deformation vibration of −CH2–, wagging of
C–H in the 1,4-trans unit (−CH=CH−), and
wagging of −CH2 in the 1,2-unit (−CH=CH2), respectively. After hydrogenation, there is no change in
the peak at 2236 cm–1 (−CN) and no −NH2 peak at 3500 cm–1 is observed, indicating
that −CN is not reduced by H2 and the selectivity
to C=C is 100% for all the samples. The intensity of the peak
at 970 and 920 cm–1 representing C=C decreased
remarkably for the hydrogenated NBR and from Figure 5d–f, it can be seen that the peak
at 920 cm–1 almost disappeared, implying the complete
hydrogenation of −CH=CH2 and also indicating
the easier hydrogenation of −CH=CH2 than
−CH=CH–. It is worth noting that there is a new
peak at 723 cm–1 appearing after hydrogenation,
assigned to −CH2– vibration in the saturated
−[CH2]n– group
(n > 4), which is induced by the hydrogenation
of
C=C. On the basis of the strength of three characteristic peaks
at 2236, 970, and 723 cm–1,30 the HD can be calculated by following eqs 1–4 1   2   3   4  where, A̅ is the peak
intensity ratio of A(970 or 723) to A(2236) and k is the absorption constant specific
to the HNBR polymer (k(723) = 0.255, k(970) = 2.3). The peak of −CN (2236 cm–1) is used as the internal standard for the HD calculation. The HD
can be calculated to be 65, 83, 89, 94, 93, and 94%, respectively,
for the six HNBR obtained by different Pd/SiO2-x (x = 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, 4, 5).

and HNBR produced by using Pd/SiO2-x as
catalysts: (a) 0.1 M; (b) 0.3 M; (c) 1 M; (d) 2 M;
(e) 4 M; and (f) 5 M.

NMR is a precise and convenient technique for characterization
to resolve the composition of polymers, which is pervasively employed
to analyze the microstructure and determine the HD in hydrogenated
elastomers.31 Therefore, to confirm the
HD values obtained from the IR method, NMR was further carried out
for two HNBR samples obtained by Pd/SiO2-0.1 and Pd/SiO2-2 as shown in Figure 6. The polymerization of butadiene usually gives rise to a
mixture of 1,4 and 1,2 C=C units, and the 1,4-addition products
have cis- and trans-isomers, whereas 1,2-addition may result in isomers
with isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic structural units. The main
peaks are assigned as follows: 5.3–5.6 ppm (−CH=CH–
of 1,4-cis and trans units), 4.9–5.1 ppm (=CH–
and =CH2 of 1,2-unit), 2.6 ppm (−CH(CN)–,
acrylonitrile units), 2.0–2.4 ppm (−CH2–
of 1,4 unit), 1.7 ppm (−CH2CH(CN)−), 1.2–1.4
ppm (−CH2−), and 0.8–0.9 ppm (−CH3).9 It can be clearly seen that
after hydrogenation, the intensity of signals for the olefinic protons
(5–5.6 nm) has obviously decreased (Figure 6b) or even disappeared (Figure 6c), but the signal for −CH(CN)–
is well maintained and no characteristic peaks for −NH2 or −NH– are observed in the 1H NMR
spectra of the two HNBR with different extents of hydrogenation, further
confirming that the selectivity to C=C is 100%. Additionally,
the peaks from about 2.0–2.4 ppm for the aliphatic protons
are shifted to the region of 0.8–1.0 ppm due to the reduction
of C=C. The HD can be calculated using the following eq 5 5  where, C(AN)
is the mole
fraction of acrylonitrile in HNBR, A is the integral
of peaks representing protons of the residual C=C units in
HNBR, and B is the integral of peaks of protons in
methylene chains in NBR. The proton peak for −CH(CN)–
is used as the internal standard, and the integral of which is set
to be 1. Thus, the HD values for HNBR produced by Pd/SiO2-0.1 and Pd/SiO2-2 are calculated to be 63 and 95%, respectively,
which is similar to FT-IR results, verifying the reliability of the
IR method.

Pd/SiO2-0.1 as the catalyst; (c) HNBR produced by using
Pd/SiO2-2 as the catalyst.

2.3 Effect of CCl– on the Catalyst Properties and Catalytic Performance
The above results reveal that CHCl has
a great influence on the size and dispersion of catalysts and their
catalytic performance. To explore the individual role of H+ and Cl–, we designed a comparative experiment,
in which CH+ was
kept at 0.1 M but CCl– was increased to 2 M by the addition of NaCl as the Cl supplement.
With such impregnation solution, the Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2 catalyst
was prepared. XRD patterns of this catalyst in different states are
shown in Figure 7.
Seven diffraction peaks, representing (111), (200), (220), (222),
(400), (420) and (422) planes of NaCl crystallites are observed due
to the over-high concentration of NaCl in the impregnation solution.
The peak at 2θ of 40° which can be observed in Pd2+/SiO2-0.1 is not detected in Pd2+/SiO2-0.1 + 2. After calcination, two peaks at 2θ = 34, 42, and
55° can be found, corresponding to the (101), (110), and (112)
planes of PdO crystalline, and after H2 reduction, the
diffraction peaks of Pd(111) and Pd(200) are seen. On the basis of
the Scherrer equation, the average sizes of PdO and Pd particles are
calculated to be 10.2 and 8.7 nm, respectively. Compared with the
catalyst prepared in CHCl of 0.1 M, the
Pd particle sizes of Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2 are much smaller than
those of Pd/SiO2-0.1. It is very interesting to find that
the particle size becomes smaller after reduction, which is opposite
to the catalysts prepared at CHCl <
1 M but consistent with catalysts acquired at CHCl > 2 M (Table 1).

Figure 7 XRD patterns of the catalyst prepared in the impregnation solution
of 0.1 M H+ and 2 M Cl– in different
states: (a) Pd2+/SiO2-0.1 + 2 catalyst before
calcination; (b) PdO/SiO2-0.1 + 2 catalyst after calcination;
and (c) Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2 catalyst after reduction.

Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2 was
further applied to hydrogenate NBR
into HNBR under the same conditions. As can be seen from FT-IR spectrum
in Figure 8, HNBR produced
by Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2 has a much weaker peak at 970 cm–1 compared with NBR and HNBR obtained by Pd/SiO2-0.1, indicating less residual C=C units in HNBR. According
to the peak intensity of 723, 970, and 2236 cm–1, the HD is calculated to be 92%, which is 27% higher than that produced
by Pd/SiO2-0.1 and comparable with that acquired by Pd/SiO2-x (x = 2, 4, 5). It is
shown that by increasing only CCl– from 0.1 to 2 M but keeping CH+ the same, as low as 0.1 M, the
Pd particle size can be dramatically decreased from 24.2 to 8.7 nm
and the catalytic activity is greatly enhanced from 65 to 92%, revealing
that CCl– plays an important role in catalyst preparation to control the particle
size and dispersity of Pd and has a significant effect on its properties
and catalytic performance.

Figure 8 FT-IR of HNBR produced by using Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2 and
Pd/SiO2-0.1 as catalysts.

The residual Pd in HNBR will affect its life and performance,
and
therefore the residue of the catalyst should be avoided as much as
possible. Pd residues in different HNBR samples are detected by inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) characterization and the results are shown in Figure 9. The Pd leaching
from the catalyst during the hydrogenation reaction is due to the
instability of Pd nanoparticles over the support, which can indirectly
reflect the strength of the interaction between Pd and the support.
When Pd/SiO2-0.1 was used as the catalyst, the residual
amount of Pd in the HNBR is as high as 463.6 ppm. By increasing only CCl– from 0.1 to
2 M, the Pd residues in HNBR can be drastically reduced to 282.6 ppm
for Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2, whereas the simultaneous increase
of CH+ to 2 M leads
to the leaching of a much less amount of Pd (only 105.9 ppm) from
Pd/SiO2-2. It is indicated that both CCl– and CH+ can improve the Pd leaching behavior
but the role of CH+ is more important, which can be further verified by the result for
Pd/SiO2-5 that only 49.5 ppm of Pd residues is detected
in the product. Therefore, although Pd/SiO2-x (x = 2, 4, 5) catalysts have similar particle size
distribution and similar catalytic activities, their Pd leaching behavior
is quite different from each other. Obviously, the increase of CH+ can greatly reduce
the amount of Pd residues in HNBR and significantly enhance the interaction
between the metal and the support, which agrees well with the XPS
results.

Figure 9 Pd residues in different HNBR samples.

The nature and quantity of the surface charge on the support
in
combination with the charge of metal precursors are important properties
to be considered during synthesis, which will remarkably affect both
distribution and dispersion of the metal over the support.22 The catalyst dispersion is optimal when there
is an electrostatic attraction between the positively charged surface
and the precursor anions or vice versa. It has been reported that
Pd(II) species have different existing forms in various CHCl due to the hydration of Pd(II) chloride complexes,
and the types of Pd(II) ion coordination are dependent on CCl–, as follows: [Pd(H2O)nCl4–n]n−2 (0 ≤ n ≤ 4). When CHCl is
less than 0.1 M, a majority of [Pd(H2O)2Cl2] and [Pd(H2O)2Cl3]− exist in solution and when CHCl is in
the range of 0.1–2 M, [Pd(H2O)2Cl3]− and PdCl42– are present primarily in solution, whereas PdCl42– exclusively exists with CHCl higher than 2 M, which is the most utilized negatively charged palladium
complex ion and very stable in acid solutions. On the other hand,
the isoelectric point of silica is 1.0–2.0,32 thus the higher the CHCl, the
more positive charges on the silica surface. Therefore, as shown in Scheme 1, there is a very
weak interaction between Pd(II) species ([Pd(H2O)2Cl2] and [Pd(H2O)2Cl3]−) and silica (with a low amount of positive charges)
in the impregnation solution of CHCl =
0.1 M, inducing a severe aggregation of Pd particles with a low catalytic
performance. With the increasing CCl–, Pd(II) ions predominately exist in the
form of PdCl42– which can increase the
electrostatic attraction to the positively charged support, thus the
Pd particle size is decreased effectively and the catalytic activity
is enhanced remarkably. Whereas the simultaneous increase of CH+ can increase the quantity
of positive charges on silica which may strengthen the electrostatic
interactions between Pd and the support, resulting in a dramatic decrease
of the Pd leaching amount during the hydrogenation reaction. Therefore,
the strong electrostatic interaction is favorable to stabilize Pd
particles over silica to reduce the particle size and avoid Pd leaching.

3 Conclusions
The effect of CH+ and CCl– in the impregnation solution on both
distribution and dispersion
of Pd/SiO2-x catalysts was investigated
and their catalytic activity for NBR hydrogenation was evaluated.
It is shown that with the increase in CHCl from 0.1 to 2 M, the Pd particle size is dramatically decreased
from 24.2 to 5.6 nm, but further increase in CHCl to 5 M, leads to almost no change in the particle size.
The catalytic activity exhibits a similar tendency, and the degree
of hydrogenation in HNBR is significantly enhanced from 65 to 94%
and then kept stable at ∼94% as CHCl increases from 2 to 5 M. But the ICP results indicate that with
the similar hydrogenation degree, the higher the CH+, the less Pd residues can be
detected in HNBR. It is indicated that CCl– could decide the existing forms of
Pd(II) chloride complexes and CH+ could alter the quantity of positive charges on the
surface of silica, which will synergistically affect the electrostatic
interaction between Pd and the support as a result. Therefore, with
the high CHCl, small particle-sized and
well-dispersed supported Pd catalyst could be acquired, which exhibits
a high catalytic performance and less Pd leaching. Our work sheds
light on the preparation of stable supported Pd catalyst with a controllable
particle size via adjusting the interaction between the Pd precursor
and the silica support, and provides an effective catalyst for high
value-added HNBR production.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
All chemicals used were
commercially available without further purification. Sodium polyacrylate
(Mw = 30 000) was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. Span 80 and Tween 80 were purchased from Aladdin
Co., Ltd. Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3, 26 wt %)
and ammonium bicarbonate (99.0%) were purchased from Beijing Chemical
Co., Ltd. Hydrochloric acid (36–38%), n-hexane
(97%), acetone (99.5%), and ethanol (95%) were obtained from Beijing
Modern Eastern Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. Palladium chloride (palladium
content: 59.5 wt %) was purchased from Shanghai Civi Chemical Technology
Co., Ltd. NBR (Mw = 360 000, ACN:
36.5 wt %) was provided by the Lanzhou Petrochemical Co., Ltd. High
purity hydrogen and nitrogen were supplied by Beijing AP BAIF Gases
Industry Co., Ltd. Water used in the experiments was deionized, doubly
distilled, and deoxygenated prior to use.

4.2 Synthesis
of Silica Support
The preparation
method for the silica support was through the ternary water/oil/water
(W/O/W) emulsion system as described in our previous work.33 First, an oil phase (a 72 mL solution of Tween
80 (1.5 g) and Span 80 (1.5 g) in n-hexane) and water
phase (14.0 g of sodium silicate solution, 22.0 g of deionized water
and 1.6 g of sodium polyacrylate) were emulsified using a homogenizer
(JB-12KD) with 10 000 rpm for 1 min to form a stable W/O emulsion.
Then, this mixture was added into the outer water phase (250 mL of
2 M NH4HCO3 solution) to form a W/O/W emulsion
system. After emulsifying for several minutes, the mixture was further
magnetically stirred for another 2 h at room temperature. Finally,
the resulting white precipitates were filtered, washed with deionized
water and methanol several times, and dried at 100 °C for 6 h.

4.3 Preparation of Pd/SiO2 Catalysts
Pd/SiO2 catalysts with 5 wt % Pd loading were prepared
by using prepared silica as the support and palladium(II) chlorinate
solution as the precursor via the incipient wetness impregnation method.
In a typical preparation, PdCl2 (0.56 mmol) was dissolved
in a certain amount of HCl solution with stirring for 2 h, then the
impregnation solution was added dropwise to the support (1 g), and
was dried at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting solids were
dried at 100 °C for 24 h and calcined at 480 °C in air for
4 h. The CHCl of impregnation solution
was set to be 0.1, 0.3, 1, 2, 4, and 5 M, respectively. The obtained
powder samples were denoted as PdO/SiO2-x, where x represents various CHCl in the preparation process. The PdO/SiO2-x catalysts were later reduced under a flow of H2 at 140 °C for 2 h (with a heating rate of 2 °C min–1). The samples were denoted as Pd/SiO2-x.

To investigate the individual effect of CCl– on the catalyst
properties and catalytic performance, NaCl (2 M) was used as the Cl
supplement and introduced into the 0.1 M HCl impregnation solution
and the preparation process was the same as described above. The obtained
catalyst was named as Pd/SiO2-0.1 + 2.

4.4 NBR Hydrogenation
The hydrogenation
reaction was carried out in a 0.5 L high pressure agitated autoclave
reactor. NBR (1 g) was dissolved in acetone (80 g) to obtain a NBR
solution (1.2 wt %). The NBR solution and catalyst (1 g) were placed
into the autoclave. Then the autoclave reactor was sealed and flushed
with N2 and H2 three times to remove air. Afterwards,
the reactor was pressurized with H2 to 2.0 MPa. The magnetic
agitation rate was adjusted to 800 rpm and the reaction temperature
was set to be 60 °C. After the reaction for 2 h, the autoclave
reactor was allowed to reach room temperature before the reaction
mixture was removed. The hydrogenated NBR solution was centrifuged
to separate the catalyst from the system. Finally, the product HNBR
was precipitated and washed with ethanol and then dried in a vacuum
oven at 60 °C for 8 h. The hydrogenation degree (HD) of the NBR
sample was analyzed by FT-IR30 and confirmed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy.31

4.5 Characterization
The physical and
chemical properties of the prepared samples were measured by several
characterization methods. The crystal phases were determined by X-ray
diffraction (XRD, Bruker AXS D8 Advance, Germany) using Cu Kα
radiation. The operation voltage and current were 40 kV and 30 mA,
respectively. The scanning speed was set as 2° min–1 in the 2θ range of 10–90°. The observed reflections
were subjected to Rietveld refinement using the Jade software. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCA Lab 250
system with monochromatized Al Kα radiation at 15 kV. The binding
energies were calibrated using a C 1s binding energy of 284.8 eV.
The peaks were fitted by a nonlinear least squares fitting program
using a properly weighted sum of Lorentzian and Gaussian component
curves after background subtraction, according to Shirley and Sherwood.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a Philips
Tecnai G2 F20 operating at 200 kV. The samples were prepared by dropping
the ethanol dispersed sample onto 300 mesh carbon-coated copper grids
and immediately evaporating the solvent. The Pd residues in HNBR were
determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP, OPTIMA 7300V). For
ICP analyses, the HNBR was first calcined in air at 600 °C for
4 h, and then the sample was digested in nitrohydrochloric acid and
finally diluted in 50 mL volumetric flasks.

Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained by Nexus 470 (Nicolet) in a
wave-number range of 400–4000 cm–1. The NBR
and HNBR samples were prepared by casting a rubber film on KBr plates.
The NBR and HNBR samples were characterized by 1H NMR spectra
recorded on a JNM-LA300FT-NMR (Japan). Deuterated chloroform was used
as the solvent in all cases.
