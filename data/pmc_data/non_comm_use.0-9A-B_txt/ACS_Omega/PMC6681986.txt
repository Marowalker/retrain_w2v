A novel UV-curable polyurethane acrylate (PUA) oligomer
was synthesized by modifying cardanol with a polyfunctional acrylate
precursor obtained through reacting pentaerythritol triacrylate with
isophoronediisocyanate. Chemical structures of the obtained cardanol-based
PUA (C-PUA) oligomer were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared
and 1H NMR. Subsequently, viscosity and gel content of
the C-PUA resins containing different quantities of hydroxymethyl
methacrylate (HEMA) were characterized. The C-PUA oligomer possessed
a viscosity of 8360 mPa s, which reduced to 115 mPa s when 40% of
the HEMA diluent was added. Furthermore, thermal, mechanical, coating,
and swelling properties of the resulting UV-cured C-PUA/HEMA materials
were investigated. The ultimate biomaterials showed excellent performance,
including a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 74–123 °C, maximum thermal degradation temperature
of 437–441 °C, tensile strength of 12.4–32.0 MPa,
tensile modulus of 107.2–782.7 MPa, and coating adhesion of
1–2. In conclusion, the developed C-PUA resins show great potential
to be applied in UV-curable materials like coatings.

Introduction
UV-curing
technology has attracted much attention because of its
various advantages such as high efficiency, mild curing conditions,
low capital spending, low energy consumption, and low volatile organic
chemical.1 Therefore, UV-curing materials
are considered “clean and green” and have been widely
used in modern industry like coatings, adhesives, drug delivery systems,
etc.2 In recent years, due to the scarcity
of fossil feedstock and concern on environmental pollution, there
is a growing interest in developing polymeric materials from renewable
resources, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and plant oils.3,4 The incorporation of UV-curing technology into biobased polymeric
materials may provide a “greener” strategy for the polymer
industry.

Cardanol is an agricultural byproduct obtained from
cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL).5−7 Although the total production of CNSL is only around 1 million tons
annually in the world, it is one of the few major sources of naturally
occurring phenols.8 Cardanol contains an
aromatic ring with an unsaturated long C15 chain at the meta-position
and a polar hydroxyl group, which may endow the resulting products
with many desirable properties like flexibility, hydrophobicity, thermal
resistance, acid/alkali resistance, etc. As a result, cardanol and
its derivatives have been widely used in industrial fields9,10 such as coatings,11−15 polybenzoxazine,16 plasticizers,17 antioxidants,18 surfactants,19 and
polymeric materials.20−22 Cardanol
has also been involved in the preparation of UV-curable materials.
Rekha et al.23 reported the synthesis of
a telechelic urethane–methacrylate cross-linkers based on cardanol,
and their curing process and double-bond conversion upon UV irradiation
was studied. Chen et al.24 investigated
the cationic photopolymerization, thermal, and mechanical properties
of thin-film materials containing epoxidized cardanol. It was found
that epoxidized cardanol imparted balanced physiochemical properties
to the cationic UV-curable materials, thus demonstrating a great potential
to be utilized as a reactive ingredient in cationic UV-curable systems.
Li et al.25 reported the synthesis of a
cardanol-based UV-curable vinyl ester monomer and its copolymerization
with maleic anhydride modified dimer fatty acids polymerized glycidyl
methacrylate to form rigid biobased materials. The resulting materials
showed good mechanical and thermal properties, all them to be used
as eco-friendly materials in coatings. In our group, we developed
several new cardanol-based diluents, including cardanyl acrylate,
epoxidized cardanyl acrylate, and epoxidized cardanol glycidyl ether.26−28 When these diluents were employed
to modify a castor oil-based polyfunctional polyurethane acrylate
(PUA) oligomer, they demonstrated good ability in reducing viscosity
and volumetric shrinkage as well as improving the biobased content
of the obtained bioresins. Compared with the many cases related to
cardanol-based diluents or biomodifiers for UV-curable resins, examples
of cardanol-based oligomers as main ingredient are few. Liu and his
coauthors reported the synthesis of a series of novel hyperbranched
UV-curable oligomers from cardanol.7,13−15 The resultant oligomers
contained rigid carbon rings as “hard cores” and high
acrylic C=C functionality, thus leading to enhanced thermal,
mechanical, and coating properties, as well as reasonably high biorenewable
contents for the UV-cured biomaterials. However, the synthesis of
these oligomers generally involved four steps, which may clearly increase
the cost of products. Besides, high viscosities (>12 000
mPa s) were observed for the oligomers,12,14 which could
also be attributed to the long route of synthesis. All these disadvantages
may greatly limit their real application in the industry of UV-curable
materials.

In this paper, we developed a cardanol-based polyurethane
acrylate (C-PUA) resin via a two-step procedure. To improve the active
C=C functionality of the C-PUA product, cardanol was capped
with a polyfunctional acrylate precursor obtained by reacting pentaerythritol
triacrylate (PETA) with isophoronediisocyanate (IPDI). The structure
of C-PUA was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and 1H NMR. Moreover, UV-curable resins were formulated using hydroxyethyl
methacylate (HEMA) as diluent and ultimate physicochemical, mechanical,
and thermal properties of the resulting materials were investigated
in detail. The aim of this research is to develop a cardanol-based
oligomer with low viscosity through a simple chemical route while
possessing high performance (e.g., stiffness) after UV curing.

Results and Discussion
Structural Characterization of C-PUA
Chemical structures
of cardanol, intermediate of IPDI–PETA, and C-PUA were determined
by FT-IR and 1H NMR, respectively. Figure 1 depicts the FT-IR spectra of cardanol, IPDI–PETA,
and C-PUA. In the spectrum of cardanol, the strong absorption at 3352
cm–1 corresponded to the hydroxyl group. The absorption
at 3008 cm–1 was assigned to the C=C–H
on the unsaturated alkyl chains. The characteristic peaks at 2925
and 2854 cm–1 were assigned to the C–H stretching
on methylene and methyl groups.29 The peaks
at 1594, 1490, and 1457 cm–1 corresponded to the
vibration absorption of benzene ring.25 In the spectrum of IPDI–PETA, the characteristic absorption
peaks at 3359 and 2267 cm–1 represented the groups
of −NH and −NCO, respectively. Moreover, the characteristic
absorption of the C=C groups and ester carbonyl from PETA are
observed at 1635, 808, and 1726 cm–1, respectively.
In the spectrum of C-PUA, several characteristic peaks were shown:
−NH group (3359 cm–1), ester carbonyl (1726
cm–1), and C=C groups (1635 and 808 cm–1).29,30 These peaks are new compared
to the spectrum of cardanol. Moreover, the peak at 2267 cm–1 representing the −NCO group almost diminished. All these
results indicated that the target compound of C-PUA was synthesized
successfully.

Figure 1 FT-IR spectra of cardanol, IPDI–PETA, and C-PUA.

1H NMR spectra of cardanol, IPDI–PETA,
and C-PUA are shown in Figure 2. In the spectrum of cardanol, the peaks at 6.8–7.3
ppm can be attributed to the protons on the benzene ring and the peaks
at 5.1–5.7 ppm were ascribed to the protons on the C=C
groups of the aliphatic segment.31 In the
spectrum of IPDI–PETA, the characteristic peaks of IPDI (0.9–1.4
ppm corresponding to the protons on the hexatomic ring) and PETA (6.0–6.6
ppm representing the protons from C=C groups) were evident.
In the spectrum of C-PUA, the characteristic peak at 7.4 ppm, belonging
to the protons at the −NH– from −NCO, confirmed
the successful reaction between IPDI, PETA, and cardanol.32 Compared with the spectrum of cardanol C-PUA,
the peak at 5.9 ppm corresponding to the −OH disappeared, reflecting
that the phenolic hydroxyl group was consumed completely. All these
changes indicated the successful synthesis of C-PUA.

Physical Properties of UV-Curable C-PUA Resins
Viscosity
Figure 3 indicates the variation of viscosity of
the C-PUA resin with the content of the HEMA diluent. It can be seen
that the pure C-PUA resin showed a viscosity value of 8360 mPa s at
25 °C. Notably, the viscosity of the C-PUA/HEMA resin dropped
from 8360 to 115 mPa s with the increase of HEMA concentration from
0 to 40%.33 To provide an efficient flow
to facilitate good processability, the favored viscosity for liquid
resins is controlled commonly in the range of 200–1000 mPa
s at ambient temperature.34 Therefore,
the viscosity of the C-PUA/HEMA systems can be adjusted to meet the
requirements of the UV-curable techniques.

Figure 3 Effect of HEMA on viscosity
and gel content of the C-PUA/HEMA resins.

Photopolymerization Kinetics of the C-PUA/HEMA Resins
Photopolymerization kinetics of the C-PUA/HEMA resins was studied
by real-time infrared (RT-IR) technique. The C=C conversion
curves of the resins are depicted in Figure 4, and the values of final C=C conversion
are listed in Table 1. The initial C=C conversion of the resins generally increased
when the content of HEMA rose from 0 to 40%. The reason for this change
may lie in the fact that the addition of more HEMA diluent decreases
the viscosity of resin, which promotes the motion of radical groups
during the UV-curing process. The final C=C conversion of the
bioresins dropped from 52.0 to 46.0% as the HEMA content increased
to 10% and then grew gradually to 70.5% as the content of HEMA increased
from 10 to 40%. The reason was that as the content of HEMA increased,
the C=C concentration of C-PUA/HEMA system was increased. At
the same time, the viscosity of the system was lowered and the diffusion
ability of the free radicals increased, and the final C=C conversion
of the C-PUA/HEMA system showed an increasing trend. In general, a
higher concentration of diluent favored the growth of the final C=C
conversion of the C-PUA resins.

Gel Content
The Cgel of the
cured C-PUA/HEMA resins were determined by Soxhlet extraction, and
the corresponding results are shown in Figure 3. First, all of the cured C-PUA/HEMA presented
high gel contents, with values ranging from 93.3 to 97.9%, suggesting
that the C-PUA resins were well cross-linked. As the content of HEMA
increased, the Cgel of the cured C-PUA
biomaterial increased gradually, indicating that the employment of
HEMA diluent can improve the cross-link extent of the C-PUA resin.

Properties of the UV-Cured C-PUA
Resins
Dynamic Mechanical Analysis
Figure 5 presents
changes of the storage modulus (E′) and the
loss factor (tan δ) with temperature for the cured C-PUA
resins, and the related data are shown in Table 1. The glass transmission temperature (Tg) was determined from the peak temperatures
of the tan δ curves. First, the pure C-PUA material demonstrated
a E′ at 25 °C (E′25) of 708.6 MPa and Tg of 74 °C,
both of which were much higher than those of the pure cardanol-based
multiarmed oligomers.13 Furthermore, as
the HEMA content grew from 0 to 40%, E′ at
25 °C (E′25) increased from
708.6 to 1578.8 MPa. Meanwhile, the Tg value increased apparently from 74 to 123 °C as the content
of HEMA increased. These results indicated that the incorporation
of the HEMA dilute could improve the thermomechanical properties of
the resulting UV-cured bioresins. The thermomechanical properties
of the thermosets usually have close correlation with the structural
factors, such as cross-link density (νe).30 According to the kinetic theory of rubber elasticity,
the νe of the cured copolymers could be determined
with the following formula35,36  where E′ is the storage
modulus of the cross-linked copolymers in the rubbery plateau region, R is the universal gas constant, and T is
the absolute temperature. In this study, the rubber modulus at the
temperature of Tg + 60 °C was employed
for the calculation of νe. The calculated νe data are presented in Table 1. The νe value increased with the
growth of HEMA, which was one of the possible reasons for the increase
of both E′25 and Tg.30 Besides, the incorporation
of HEMA could bring steric hindrance into the cross-linked structures,
which is another possible reason for the growth of E′25 and Tg.

(b) loss factor of the UV-cured
C-PUA/HEMA materials.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
TGA thermograms and their derivative curves of the UV-cured C-PUA/HEMA
resins are shown in Figure 6. The relevant results are summarized in Table 1. The degradation process of
UV-cured C-PUA/HEMA can be divided into four stages. The first stage
(<240 °C) was slowest, which is due to the removal of residual
low-molecular-weight ingredients.15 The
second stage at 240–380 °C can be assigned to the decomposition
of hard segment in the urethane structures connecting with cardanol
or PETA.37 The third stage at 380–510
°C was quickest and can be ascribed to the degradation of the
cross-linked bonds and char formation, while the last stage (>510
°C) corresponded to the gradual degradation of char residue.
Furthermore, when the content of HEMA increased from 0 to 40%, the
5% weight-loss temperature (T5) increased
from 247 to 263 °C, while the maximum thermal degradation temperature
(Tp) and char yield (wchar) slightly decreased, indicating that the incorporation
of the HEMA diluent did not influence the thermal stability of the
new bioresins too much.

Mechanical
Properties
The typical tensile stress–strain curves
of the UV-cured C-PUA/HEMA reins are shown in Figure 7, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 2. It can be seen that
all the biobased materials fractured without reaching a yield point,
indicating the rigid characteristic of the materials.30,38 When the content of HEMA grew from 0 to 40%, the tensile strength
increased significantly from 12.4 to 31.9 MPa, and Young’s
modulus increased from 107.2 to 782.7 MPa. The large increase may
also be attributed to the growing cross-link density of the obtained
materials and the incorporation of the HEMA diluent with steric hindrance.38

Coating Properties
The coating properties of the UV-cured C-PUA/HEMA materials including
adhesion, pencil hardness, and flexibility were investigated, and
the data are listed in Table 2. Obviously, as the HEMA concentration grew from 0 to 40%,
the adhesion grew from 2 to 1, the pencil hardness changed gradually
from B to HB, while the flexibility was maintained at the minimum
value of 2 mm. The improvement of adhesion is probably attributed
to the increase of the hydroxyl concentration provided by HEMA, while
the growth of hardness can be ascribed to both the growth of νe and the incorporation of steric structure too.38,39

Swelling Properties
The
solvent resistance of the cured C-PUA/HEMA resins was examined, and
the results are listed in Table 3. In general, all the cured materials exhibited better
resistance to water than to organic solvents. As the concentration
of HEMA rose from 0 to 40%, the uptake of water increased basically
from 0.2 to 1.5%, which is possibly because of the growing content
of hydroxyl groups from HEMA. Meanwhile, the uptake of ethanol and
toluene dropped gradually from 3.8 to 2.7% and from 9.3 to 2.9%, respectively,
while the absorbed amounts of acetone grew first from 5.4 to 8.9%
and then dropped to 6.6%. The improvement of resistance to ethanol
and toluene may be attributed to the growing cross-link density of
the cured materials when the HEMA content increased.35,40

Conclusions
In
this work a novel cardanol-based polyfunctional PUA oligomer was successfully
synthesized by a simple two-step procedure. The viscosity of oligomer
was obviously lower than those of the hyperbranched cardanol-based
oligomers shown in previous works. Moreover, the resulting UV-cured
biomaterials containing the HEMA diluent demonstrated excellent ultimate
properties such as storage modulus, Tg, maximum thermal degradation temperature, tensile strength and modulus,
and adhesion and flexibility of coatings, mainly due to the high C=C
functionality of oligomer and the special structures (e.g., benzene
ring) involved in cardanol. Therefore, the developed cardanol-based
PUA resins show promise to be used in UV-curable materials like coatings.

Experimental Section
Materials
Cardanol (MD5036) was purchased from Shanghai
Meidong Biological Materials Co., Ltd. (China). Isophoronediisocyanate
(IPDI, 99%) was supplied by Nine Ding Chemistry Co., Ltd. (China).
Dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL) was obtained from Shanghai Titan Scientific
Co., Ltd. (China). 2-Hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone (Darocur 1173,
98%), pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA, 96%), and 4-methoxyphenol
(98%) were bought from Sahn Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. (China).
HEMA (97%) was purchased from Adamas Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).

Synthesis of Cardanol-Based Polyurethane
Acrylate
The synthetic route for the C-PUA product is outlined
in Scheme 1. IPDI (19.98
g, 0.09 mol), 0.30 g of 4-methoxyphenol, 30 mL of hexane, and 0.25
g of catalyst DBTDL were placed together into a four-neck round-bottom
flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, refluxing condenser, dropping
funnel, and an inlet for nitrogen (N2) gas. Under the atmosphere
of N2, the reaction mixture was agitated and heated to
45 °C and then 29.8 g (0.10 mol) of PETA was slowly added. After
that the mixture was heated to 60 °C and agitated at this temperature
for 6 h. Subsequently, 27.45 g (0.09 mol) of cardanol was used to
react with the remaining isocyanate at 60 °C. The reaction did
not stop until the concentration of free isocyanate (determined by
the method of n-butyl amine reverse titration41) dropped to ∼0%. Finally, the hexane
solvent was evaporated via rotary evaporation and the C-PUA product
as a light yellow transparent viscous liquid was obtained.

C-PUA and Chemical Structure
of HEMA
Curing of the C-PUA Resins
The UV-curable
samples were formulated by mixing the obtained oligomer, HEMA diluent,
and Darocur 1173 (3% of the total weight of C-PUA and HEMA) for 20
min, followed by centrifuged to remove air bubbles. After that the
mixture was poured into homemade poly(tetrafluoroethylene) molds or
spread on tinplates, which were polished and cleaned with acetone.
At last, all of the samples were cured by an Intelli-Ray 400 W UV
light-curing microprocessor (Uvitron International Corporation) with
an UV light intensity of 100 mW cm–2 for 4 min.
The cured samples were stored in a glass desiccator for 7 days before
further evaluation.

Characterization
FT-IR spectra of the samples were recorded on a Nicolet iS10 IR
spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher) with a scanning range from 4000 to 500
cm–1. 1H NMR spectra of the samples were
performed on a DRX-300 spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) with deuterated
chloroform as the solvent.

Viscosity (Vs) of the UV-curable resins was tested by a DVS+ digital-display
viscometer (Brookfield Corporation) with a small sample adapter at
25 °C.

Gel content (Cgel) of
the UV-cured samples was determined via Soxhlet extraction. Typically,
an UV-cured specimen with a mass of about 0.5 g was weighted and extracted
by acetone using the Soxhlet extractor for 24 h. Then, the specimen
was dried in oven at 60 °C to give a constant weight and weighed
again. The Cgel values were determined
from the weight ratio of the specimen after and before extraction.

The measurement of volumetric shrinkage (ΔV) was performed on a ZMD-2 electronic automatic density meter (Fangrui
Instrument Corporation, China). The ΔV value
was calculated via the determined densities of the samples before
and after UV curing. The ΔV values were calculated
by the following formula  where ρS and ρl are the densities of the UV-cured
samples and the uncured liquid resins, respectively.

Dynamic
mechanical analysis of the UV-cured samples was carried out on a Q800
solids analyzer (TA Corporation) with an oscillating frequency of
1 Hz in double cantilever mode. The cured samples with a size of 40
× 6 × 1 mm3 were examined from −80 to
200 °C and a heating rate of 3 °C min–1.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the UV-cured samples
was performed on an STA 409PC thermogravimetry instrument (Netzsch
Corporation, Germany) with a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR. The samples were
heated from 40 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under N2 as the purge gas.

Mechanical
properties of the UV-cured samples were carried out on a SANS7 CMT-4304
Universal tester (Shenzhen Xinsansi Jiliang Instrument Corporation,
China) with a cross-head speed of 5 mm min–1. Dumbbell
specimens with a size of 62 × 10 × 3 mm3 were
measured. The tensile properties for each sample were determined from
an average value of five specimens.

Coating properties of the
UV-cured samples including adhesion, pencil hardness, and flexibility
were evaluated according to GB 1720-79(89), GB/T 6739-2006, and GB/T
6739-1996, respectively. Detailed procedures are reported in our previous
works.27,30

Swelling properties of the UV-cured
samples were determined using water, ethanol, acetone, and toluene
as solvents. Specimens were weighed and immersed ion different solvents
for 48 h at ambient temperatures, then dried, and weighed again. The
swelling properties with various solvents were calculated by the following
formula  where W0 and W1 are the masses of the cured sample before and after immersion in
the solvent, respectively.

UV-curing behaviors of the biobased
resins were studied by a modified Nicolet 5700 spectrometer from Thermo-Nicolet
Instrument. The conversion of double bond (C=C) was determined
by monitoring the change of absorption at about 810 cm–1.
