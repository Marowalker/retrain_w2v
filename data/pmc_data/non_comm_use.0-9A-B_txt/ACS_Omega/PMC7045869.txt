In the immersion precipitation process for membrane formation, a polymer casting film
is placed in contact with a nonsolvent in a coagulation bath; an essential feature of
the membrane formation process is the foray into the metastable region of the ternary
phase diagram for the nonsolvent/solvent/polymer system. The primary objective of this
article is to trace the origins of such forays. The Maxwell–Stefan diffusion
formulation is combined with the Flory–Huggins description of phase equilibrium
thermodynamics to set up a model for describing the transient equilibration trajectory
that is followed in the polymer casting film. Four different systems are analyzed:
water/acetone/CA, water/DMF/PVDF, water/NMP/PSF, and water/NMP/PEI (CA = cellulose
acetate; PVDF = poly(vinylidene fluoride); PSF = polysulfone; PEI = polyetherimide, DMF
= dimethyl formamide; NMP = N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone). The analysis shows
that diffusional forays are mainly engendered due to thermodynamic coupling effects;
such effects are quantified by the set of thermodynamic factors , where
ai, the activity of species
i, is dependent on the volume fractions,
ϕi and ϕj, of
both nonsolvent (i) and solvent (j). In regions close
to phase transitions, the off-diagonal elements
Γij(i ≠ j)
are often negative and may attain large magnitudes in relation to the diagonal elements
Γii. Strong thermodynamic coupling effects cause
the transient equilibration trajectories to be strongly curvilinear, causing ingress
into the metastable region. If thermodynamic coupling effects are ignored, no such
ingress occurs. It is also shown that analogous diffusional forays may lead to emulsion
formation in partially miscible liquid mixtures.

1 Introduction
The landmark discovery of the asymmetric cellulose acetate (CA) membrane by Loeb and
Sourirajan1 for water desalination has had a significant technological
impact on the development of a wide variety of polymer membranes that have several practical
applications.2,3 To
set the scene for this article and define its objectives, let us consider the basic
principles of the immersion precipitation procedure that was originally used for preparing
CA membranes.3−13 The ternary
phase diagram for ternary water/acetone/CA solutions, constructed on the basis of the volume
fractions using the Flory–Huggins description of phase equilibrium thermodynamics, is
shown in Figure 1. The binodal curve for this
ternary mixture defines the limits of phase miscibility; the compositions at the end of a
tie-line are in thermodynamic equilibrium requiring equality of component activities,
ai, in the two contiguous fluid phases. The
spinodal curve defines the limit of phase stability. Along the spinodal curve, the
determinant |Γ| = 0, where |Γ| is a 2 × 2 dimensional matrix of
thermodynamic correction factors with elements defined
by 1  where
ϕi and ϕj denote the
volume fractions of water and acetone, respectively.14,15

Figure 1 Transient equilibration trajectories A–A*, B–B*, and C–C* during
the immersion precipitation process for membrane preparation. These trajectories were
determined from simulations using the starting compositions A, B, and C in the polymer
casting film. Further calculation details and data inputs are provided in the Supporting Information (SI) accompanying this publication.

The inset to Figure 1 is a schematic of the
immersion precipitation process in which a thin layer of casting film of the acetone/CA
mixture, placed on a support layer, is brought into contact with water in a coagulation
bath. As illustrated, the transient equilibration trajectory when a 10% solution of CA in
acetone is immersed in the coagulation bath is indicated by the solid blue line connecting A
and A*. With increasing immersion contact times, the compositions within the polymer casting
film will get progressively richer in water and impoverished in
acetone.3,5,6,12,13 Consequently, the
equilibration trajectories get progressively closer to the binodal curve. Figure 1 plots the progression in the equilibration trajectories
A–A*, B–B*, and C–C* with increasing immersion times. All three
trajectories are strongly curvilinear. Particularly noteworthy is that the trajectory
C–C* has penetrated into the metastable region between the binodal and spinodal
curves. This foray into the metastable region causes precipitation of polymer in the casting
film. Experimental evidence of such forays is provided by McHugh and Tsay.16

The primary objective of this article is to trace the theoretical origins of the
diffusional foray into the metastable region as witnessed for the trajectory C–C*.
For this purpose, we set up a model to describe the equilibration trajectories by combining
the Flory–Huggins description of phase equilibrium with the Maxwell–Stefan
formulations for diffusion.17−21 By detailed
analysis of four different systems: water/acetone/CA, water/DMF/PVDF, water/NMP/PSF, and
water/NMP/PEI (CA = cellulose acetate; PVDF = poly(vinylidene fluoride); PSF = polysulfone;
PEI = polyetherimide; DMF = dimethyl formamide; NMP =
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), we aim to show that the diffusional forays into
metastable regions are primarily engendered by thermodynamic coupling effects that are
quantified by the off-diagonal elements
Γij(i ≠ j). The
secondary objective of this article is to demonstrate that the same concepts and modeling
approaches are applicable to describe diffusion-induced ingress into metastable regions,
resulting in emulsification22−24 and production of
nanospheres and nanoparticles by the exploitation of the “Ouzo
effect”.25−27

2 Results and Discussions
2.1 Maxwell–Stefan Formulation for Diffusion in Ternary Polymer Solutions
For a description of diffusion in ternary nonsolvent (1)/solvent (2)/polymer (m)
solutions, it is convenient to use volume fractions, ϕi,
as composition measures because this facilitates combination with the Flory–Huggins
description of phase equilibrium. Let us define the volumetric diffusion fluxes
JiV, relative to the volume average velocity of the mixture
uV = ϕ1u1 +
ϕ2u2 +
ϕmum. 2  The
volume fractions are related to the molar concentrations,
ϕi =
ciV̅i,
where V̅i is the partial molar volume
of species i. The use of uV as a reference
velocity is particularly convenient for polymeric solutions because
V̅i is practically composition
independent.

In the Maxwell–Stefan (M–S) formulation, the volumetric diffusion fluxes,
JiV, expressed in the units m3 m–2
s–1, are related to the chemical potential gradients as
follows17,18,20 3  The
M–S diffusivities, Đ1mV and Đ2mV, quantifying interactions (“friction”) between
species 1 and 2 with the polymer chains are relatable to the self-diffusivities in polymer
solutions, for which estimation procedures using the free-volume theory are well
established.28−30 The M–S
diffusivities Đ12V and Đ21V, appearing in the first right members of eq 3, quantify the 1–2 friction. The symmetry constraint demanded by the
Onsager reciprocal relations
is 4  The
M–S diffusivities Đ12V and Đ21V are relatable to the M–S diffusivities in binary
nonsolvent/solvent solutions for which reliable estimation procedures are available in the
literature.14,15,31,32 Detailed derivations of eq 3, including comparison with the equivalent Bearman
friction formulation,28,30,33,34 along with step-by-step procedures
for estimation of the set of M–S diffusivities are provided in the Supporting Information (SI) accompanying this publication.

In view of eq 1, the left members of eq 3 can be expressed in terms of the gradients in the
volume
fractions 5  For
the system water (1)/acetone (2)/CA (3), Figure 2a shows calculations of the four elements Γij
as a function of the volume fractions of CA that lie on a straight line connecting A
(ϕ10 = 0.2181; ϕ20 = 0.34308) with A*
(ϕ1I = 0.2181; ϕ2I = 0.34308) in Figure 1. Particularly noteworthy are the large negative values
of Γ21. Γij factors have the effect of
influencing the driving forces for the transport of water (1) and acetone (2), into and
away from the casting film. Thermodynamic coupling effects on the driving forces for water
and acetone transport may be quantified by the factors Γ11 +
Γ12 (Δϕ2/Δϕ1) and
Γ21 (Δϕ1/Δϕ2) +
Γ22, where Δϕi denotes the
difference between the interfacial volume fractions,
ϕiI, and those at the start of the equilibration
process,
ϕi0 6

Γij. (b, c) Calculations of (b)
Γ11 + Γ12
(Δϕ2/Δϕ1) and (c) Γ21
(Δϕ1/Δϕ2) for volume fractions along a
straight line connecting A–A*, B–B*, and C–C* in Figure 1. Further calculation details and data inputs are
provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

These terms are plotted in Figure 2b,c for
volume fractions along straight lines connecting A–A*, B–B*, and
C–C*. In all three cases, the influence of thermodynamic coupling is to suppress
both the driving forces of water and acetone. If thermodynamic coupling effects are
ignored by invoking the assumption Γij =
δij, the Kronecker delta, both these factors should
be unity. Remarkably, we note that for C–C* equilibration, thermodynamic coupling
serves not only to reduce the magnitude of the driving force for water transport but also
to reverse its sign. The precise consequences of such sign reversals will be elaborated in
a later section.

Combining eqs 3 and 5 and casting
into matrix notation, we
obtain 7  Premultiplying eq 7 by [B]–1, we can
explicitly relate the diffusion fluxes to the gradients in the volume
fractions 8  Equation 8 also
serves to define the 2 × 2 dimensional square matrix of Fick diffusivities
[D], which is a product of two square matrices
[B]–1 and [Γ]. Generally
speaking, the off-diagonal contributions of each of the two matrices,
[B]–1 and [Γ] are
non-negligible; consequently, molecular diffusion in ternary polymer solutions is a
strongly coupled process.

Figure 3 shows calculations of the elements of
the Fick diffusivity matrix [D] for volume fractions that lie on a
straight line connecting A with A* in Figure 1.
The variation of the four elements of [D] with the volume fraction of CA
shows approximately the same trends as the corresponding elements of the matrix of
thermodynamic factors [Γ] in Figure 2a. The
large negative value of the off-diagonal element D21 is
largely engendered by the corresponding negative off-diagonal element
Γ21.

2.2 Modeling Transient Diffusion in the Immersion Precipitation Process
To meet the objectives of this article, we seek an analytic solution to describe the
immersion precipitation transience and essentially follow the model of Tsay and
McHugh.13 The diffusion process is considered to be essentially
uni-(z)-directional; the position z = 0 corresponds to
the position of the interface at the start of the equilibration process. The contiguous
immiscible phases, coagulation bath and polymer casting film, are both considered to be
semi-infinite. At the position z = +∞, the composition corresponds
to that of the bulk coagulation bath that is time-invariant. At the position
z = −∞, the composition corresponds to that of the
polymer casting film that is in contact with the support layer; this composition is also
time-invariant. At any time t, during the immersion precipitation
process, we have thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface between the two immiscible
phases, at compositions A* and CB*. The volume fractions
ϕiI and ϕ1bI are determined by the
thermodynamic equilibrium
constraints 9  The
Flory–Huggins (F–H) description of phase equilibrium
thermodynamics17−19,35−37 is used to
solve the set of eq 9; calculation details and
F–H input parameters for all investigated systems are provided in the SI.

The transient ternary diffusion within the polymer casting film is described by a set of
two coupled partial differential
equations 10  Inserting eq 8
for the volumetric fluxes results
in 11  Commonly, the coagulation bath consists of a binary
mixture of nonsolvent (1) and solvent (2). As a good approximation, the composition of the
coagulation bath may be assumed to be polymer-free. The corresponding relation for the
transient diffusion process in the coagulation bath is described
by 12  The
subscript b in eq 12 refers to the coagulation
bath, and Db represents the Fick diffusivity in the binary
solution in the bath.

The initial conditions for eqs 11 and 12
are 13  where ϕi0 and
ϕ1b0 are the initial compositions of the polymer casting film and bath,
respectively.

The boundary conditions
are 14  An
analytic solution for the transient volume fractions in the bath is obtained if the Fick
diffusivity Db is assumed to be composition
independent13,38 15  The
corresponding analytic expression for the volume fractions in the polymer casting film is
also derivable if the Fick diffusivity matrix [D] =
[B]−1[Γ] is also assumed to be composition
independent; see Taylor and Krishna.31 In all of the calculations
presented in this article, the Fick [D] is evaluated at the average
volume fractions ; this linearization procedure has been established to yield results
of good accuracy.18 The transient volume fractions in the polymer film
can be written as 2 × 2 dimensional matrix generalization of eq
15; see Taylor and Krishna31 for further
theoretical background on matrix generalization
procedures 16  Due
to interchange of nonsolvent and solvent between the polymer casting film and the bath,
the position of the interface, ε(t) =
r√t, will shift with
time 17  In
eq 17, ε(t) =
r√t is the position of the moving interface,
and r is a constant with units of m s–1/2, which is
determinable from the continuity of component fluxes at either side of the moving
interface 18  The
simultaneous solution of the set of four nonlinear eqs 9 and 18 allows calculation of the interfacial compositions
ϕ1I, ϕ2I, ϕ1bI, and
r.

2.3 Simulations of Four Immersion Precipitation Processes
First, we investigate in detail the C–C* equilibration trajectory followed in the
water/acetone/CA casting film when the initial volume fractions in the casting film are
chosen as ϕ10 = 0.28; ϕ20 = 0.63; ϕ1b0
= 0.75; and ϕ2b0 = 0.25; corresponding to the position C indicated in
Figure 1. The simultaneous solution of the
equations describing thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface (eq 9) and the flux continuity relations (eq 18) results in the interfacial volume fractions ϕ1I
= 0.24596; ϕ2I = 0.46422; and ϕ1bI = 0.6753; these
correspond to C* and CB*. The value of r = −3.46302 ×
10–6 is negative because of the shrinkage of the polymer casting film
due to the impoverishment of acetone. Evaluated at the arithmetic average volume fractions
between the initial and final equilibrated compositions, , the elements of the matrix of
thermodynamic factors, and the Fick diffusivity matrix are:
 and
.
Noteworthy are the large negative values of both off-diagonal elements
Γ12 and Γ21. Both off-diagonal elements
D12 and D21 are also negative,
primarily because of the corresponding negative values of Γ12 and
Γ21.

The equilibration trajectory calculated using eq 16 is plotted in Figure 4a composition
space; we note that the C–C* is strongly curvilinear and has penetrated into the
metastable region.

The dashed lines represent simulation results when the simplification
Γij = δij, the
Kronecker delta, is invoked. (b) Transient volume fraction profiles in the casting
solution, as a function of the dimensionless distance coordinate

Further calculation details and data inputs are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

The volume fractions of the three components are plotted in Figure 4b as a function of the dimensionless distance coordinate
 in the
casting film, where we take the value of the reference diffusivity
Dref = 1 × 10–9 m2
s–1. There is a significantly higher volume fraction of the polymer
near the surface of the casting film, z ≈ 0. This implies that the
polymer distributes asymmetrically across the membrane thickness, resulting in an
asymmetric polymer membrane. Also noteworthy is that the volume fraction of water shows a
pronounced overshoot at ; this overshoot signifies uphill diffusion.14,32,39 The overshoot
in water is a direct result of the influence of thermodynamic coupling on the driving
force of water, causing the effective driving force to undergo sign reversal, as witnessed
in Figure 2b.

To delineate the influence of thermodynamic coupling, we repeated the simulations by
invoking the assumption Γij =
δij and calculating the Fick matrix using
[D] = [B]−1; this results in
C–C* trajectory indicated by the dashed line in Figure 4a. No ingress into the metastable region is experienced, and the
trajectory tends to veer away from the binodal curve in its approach to C*. The
inescapable conclusion is that the influence of the thermodynamic correction factors is to
draw the trajectories into the metastable region, leading eventually to polymer
precipitation.

Next, we analyze the transient equilibration trajectory followed in the ternary
water/NMP/PSF solutions in which the initial volume fractions in the polymer casting film
and coagulation bath are chosen as ϕ10 = 0; ϕ20 = 0.7;
ϕ1b0 = 0.3; ϕ2b0 = 0.7, corresponding to the position
A indicated in Figure 5a. The simultaneous
solution of the equations describing thermodynamic equilibrium at the interface (eq 9) and the flux continuity relations (eq 18) results in the interfacial volume fractions
ϕ1I = 0.01623; ϕ2I = 0.23293; and
ϕ1bI = 0.25625. Both the off-diagonal elements of
 and
 are
negative. The strong coupling effects cause the A–A* equilibration trajectory to
exhibit a foray into the metastable region. The dashed line in Figure
5a represents the trajectory followed by invoking the
assumption Γij = δij
and ignoring thermodynamic correction factors; in this scenario, the A–A* does not
cross the binodal curve.

Transient volume fraction profiles in the casting solution, as a function of the
dimensionless distance coordinate . Further calculation details and data
inputs are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

The volume fractions of the three components are plotted in Figure 5a as a function of the dimensionless distance coordinate
 in the
casting film. The polymer composition is significantly higher near the surface of the
casting film, z ≈ 0, resulting eventually in an asymmetric PSF
membrane. The transient overshoot of water signifies uphill transport.

The analyses of the A–A* equilibration trajectories for water/NMP/PEI and
water/DMF/PVDF solutions proceed along precisely analogous lines; the results are
summarized in Figure 6a–d. Incursions into
the metastable regions, induced by off-diagonal elements
Γij(i ≠ j),
are experienced in both cases. Uphill diffusion causes overshoots in water compositions
near the surface of the casting films, and the congregation of PEI and PVDF polymers near
the surface of the casting film, z ≈ 0, is also evident in Figure 6b,d.

Figure 6 (a, b) Transient equilibration in the water/NMP/PEI casting film. (c, d) Transient
equilibration in the water/DMF/PVDF casting film. Further calculation details and data
inputs are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

The phenomena of uphill diffusion resulting in transient overshoots of water experienced
in the four examples above are, however, not in violation of the second law of
thermodynamics.32,39 As verification, the corresponding transient profiles of the activity
of water are plotted in Figure 7; in all four
cases, the variation of activity along the dimensionless distance is monotonic. Put
another way, water transport is down the activity hill.

water/NMP/PSF, water/NMP/PEI, and water/DMF/PVDF plotted as a function of the
dimensionless distance coordinate .

2.4 Emulsion Formation in Partially Miscible Liquid/Liquid Mixtures
We now demonstrate analogies between the immersion precipitation process with emulsion
formation. According to Miller,22 “If the two bulk liquids are
not initially at equilibrium, it is conceivable that dynamic processes such as diffusion
could produce emulsification when the two liquids are brought into contact without
stirring.” The necessary conditions for spontaneous emulsification are derived by
Ruschak and Miller23 in terms of diffusion equilibration composition
trajectories that must necessarily enter the metastable regions. These authors adopted the
Fickian formulation in which the diffusion flux of each species i is
considered to be linearly dependent on its own composition gradient, with the Fickian
diffusivities of each component equal to one another.

As illustrated, Figure 8 shows the phase diagram
for the partially miscible water (1)/ethanol (2)/benzene (3) mixtures at 298 K. Bringing
pure water (indicated by A) in contact with a 50:50 ethanol/benzene mixture (indicated by
B) results in a mixture composition (indicated by M) that ends up in the two-phase region
of the phase diagram. This mixture will separate into two liquid phases of compositions A*
and B* that lie on the binodal curve at either end of the tie-line. The phase A will
equilibrate to the composition A*, while phase B will equilibrate to B*. Using the model
of Ruschak and Miller,23 wherein all of the component diffusivities in
the ternary mixture are equal to one another, the diffusion equilibration trajectories
A–A* and B–B* will both be straight lines in ternary composition space. We
note that the A–A* trajectory lies in the metastable region between the binodal and
spinodal curves. This foray into the metastable region is a necessary condition for
emulsification to occur. Vitale and Katz27 have coined the generic term
Ouzo effect to describe such a process of creating metastable liquid–liquid
dispersions. Since no input of mechanical energy is involved, this offers an
energy-efficient method of producing nanospheres and nanoparticles.25

Figure 8 Transient equilibration trajectories A–A* and B–B* for the
water/ethanol/benzene mixture at 298 K, demonstrating foray into the metastable region
in the water-rich region of the phase diagram. The solid blue lines represent the
trajectories calculated using the Ruschak–Miller model. Further calculation
details and data inputs are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

The Ruschak–Miller model is overly simplistic because the linear equilibration
trajectories are only realized if the thermodynamic correction factors are ignored,
Γij = δij, and the
Fick diffusivity matrix [D], in either contiguous fluid phase,
degenerates to a scalar diffusivity times the identity matrix.14,15 Detailed analysis of the published
experimental data on diffusivities in several partially miscible ternary liquid mixtures
reveals that the interdiffusion process is strongly coupled due to thermodynamic
correction factors close to regions of phase transitions, and the off-diagonal elements of
the Fick diffusivity matrix [D] exert significant influences on the
equilibration trajectories.14,15,32,39

The model for the immersion precipitation process is amenable to the straight-forward
extension to cater for interdiffusion between two partially miscible liquid phases (A, B),
with two different Fick diffusivity matrices [DA] and
[DB]; the detailed derivations are available in the
SI.

Figure 9a shows the simulation results for
A–A* and B–B* equilibration trajectories for glycerol/acetone/water
mixtures; both trajectories are both strongly curvilinear in composition space; in the
glycerol-rich phase, the B–B* exhibits a foray into the metastable region with the
potential for emulsification. Similarly, for water/acetic acid/MTBE mixtures, the ingress
of B–B* into the metastable region (see Figure 9b) in the MTBE-rich phase may result in emulsion formation. Analogous results
are obtained for water/chloroform/acetic acid, water/acetone/ethyl-acetate,
water/ethanol/ethyl-acetate, and water/acetic acid/1-hexanol mixtures; see simulation
results in Figures S24, S25, S27, and S29. It is noteworthy that the
Ruschak–Miller model with straight-line equilibration would also have anticipated
the possibilities of emulsification for all of the aforementioned six mixtures.

Figure 9 (a) Transient equilibration trajectories for the glycerol (1)/acetone (2)/water (3)
mixture at 298 K, demonstrating foray into the meta-region in the glycerol-rich phase.
(b) Transient equilibration trajectories for the system water (1)/acetic acid (2)/MTBE
(3) at 298 K, demonstrating forays into the metastable region in the MTBE-rich phase.
Further calculation details and data inputs are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

We now demonstrate scenarios in which forays into metastable regions can occur under
conditions that are not anticipated using the model of Ruschak and Miller.23 For water (1)/ethanol (2)/cyclohexane (3) mixtures, we choose the set of
starting compositions for the ethanol-rich phase (A) and cyclohexane-rich phase (B) as
x1A0 = 0.375; x2A0 = 0.62;
x1B0 = 0; x2B0 = 0.57; see Figure 10a. The composition of the A–B
mixture, A* = B* = x1I = 0.1875;
x2I = 0.595, lies in the homogeneous single-phase region,
but close to the binodal curve. According to the Ruschak–Miller analysis, no entry
into the metastable regions is possible. Calculations of the A–A* and B–B*
trajectories with reliable estimates of the Maxwell–Stefan diffusivities, along
with proper accounting of thermodynamic correction factors (using the NRTL equation for
phase equilibrium), lead to curvilinear trajectories. The B–B* penetrates the
metastable zone in the cyclohexane-rich phase. The composition profiles of the three
components are plotted in Figure 10b as a
function of the dimensionless distance coordinate . We note that ethanol experiences a
pronounced undershoot during the transient equilibration process. Concomitantly,
cyclohexane displays a slight overshoot. The overshoot/undershoot phenomena, along with
the entry into the metastable zone, are engendered by the significant off-diagonal
elements of 
in the cyclohexane-rich phase. Indeed, if thermodynamic coupling effects are completely
ignored by invoking the assumption Γij =
δij, the equilibration trajectory (shown by the
dotted line in Figure 10a) shows no entry into
the metastable region.

two different compositions A and B for the system water (1)/ethanol (2)/cyclohexane
(3) at 298 K. (b) Transient composition profiles plotted as a function of the
dimensionless distance coordinate . Further calculation details and data
inputs are provided in the Supporting Information accompanying this publication.

Analyses of transient equilibration in glycerol/acetone/water,
water/acetone/ethyl-acetate, water/acetic acid/1-hexanol, and water/acrylonitrile/toluene
mixtures yield results that are precisely analogous to those in Figure
10; see Figures S23, S26, S29, S32, and S33. In all cases, thermodynamic coupling
induces entry into metastable zones, while the Ruschak–Miller model calculations do
not anticipate such incursions.

The crystal formation and growth as a consequence of diffusional foray into
supersaturated regions is also a consequence of thermodynamic
coupling.32,40

3 Conclusions
For partially miscible ternary fluid mixtures, diffusivities in regions close to phase
transitions are strongly influenced by phase equilibrium thermodynamics. These influences
are quantified by thermodynamic correction factors Γij,
whose off-diagonal elements Γ12 and Γ21 are often
significantly large in relation to the Γ11 and Γ22.
Consequently, interphase diffusion is a strongly coupled process that results in strongly
curvilinear equilibration trajectories during transient equilibration. Such trajectories
often signify uphill diffusion phenomena, and cause forays into the metastable regions,
lying between the binodal and spinodal curves. Such forays are essential in the immersion
precipitation process for the preparation of CA, PSF, PEI, and PVDF membranes, with
asymmetry in the polymer distribution along the thickness. In all cases, if the off-diagonal
elements Γ12 and Γ21 are set to zero, no polymer
precipitation is realized. The transient development of volume fractions of water in the
polymer casting film exhibits overshoots in all of the four cases; such overshoots are
signatures of uphill diffusion. The theoretical model developed in this work should provide
guidelines to the polymer chemist for choosing a set of operating conditions, and mixture
compositions in the casting film and coagulation bath to prepare asymmetric polymeric
membranes.

The exploitation of the Ouzo effect for the formation of metastable emulsions in
liquid/liquid mixtures is also crucially dependent on thermodynamic coupling effects.
