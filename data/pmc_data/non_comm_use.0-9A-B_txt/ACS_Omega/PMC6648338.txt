This study investigates the degradation
of dimethyl phthalate (DMP)
with hydrogen peroxide and ferrate (Fe(VI)) under various reaction
conditions. The results showed that the optimum conditions for dimethyl
phthalate removal from water were as follows: (a) pH 7.0 and (b) the
original molar ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2]/[DMP]
equal to 10:2:1. Under the optimum conditions, the degradation rate
of DMP can reach 89.7% in 360 min. Furthermore, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde,
isophthalic acid, 2-ethylhexanol, oxalic acid, 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic
acid, 2,6-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and monomethyl
phthalate were identified as the degradation intermediates, and degradation
pathways were proposed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Phthalate
esters (PAEs), also known as phthalates, are commonly
used as plasticizers and in the manufacture of insecticide carriers,
propellants, and cosmetics.1 Since PAEs
are not chemically bound to the host plastics, they are inevitably
leached from the products and released into the environment ultimately,
and these organic compounds have caused a huge damage to water and
air environment as pollutants. Dimethyl phthalate (DMP) ester is a
common short-chained ester, which has been detected in many natural
environments including marine waters, water courses, and sediments.2 DMP is relatively recalcitrant to biodegradation
in the natural environment because of its benzene carboxylic group
and its hydrolysis half-life of about 3 years.3 It has already been listed as a priority organic pollutant by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency because of its toxicological
properties and potential risks to human health, wildlife, and the
environment.4 Thus, it is necessary to
identify appropriate treatment technologies to remove DMP and remediate
its adverse effects.

Recently, several advanced technologies
have been described for
removing DMP, such as ozonation,5 photocatalysis,6,7 adsorption,8 chemical oxidation,9 and bioconversion.10 These technologies were shown to be capable of degrading various
aqueous pollutants into less toxic substances. Among these possible
treatment technologies, chemical oxidation has emerged as a promising
method with a wide application due to its high efficiency, short reaction
time, and simple operation. In recent years, the commonly used chemical
oxidants have been Fenton’s reagent, ozone, potassium permanganate,
potassium persulfate, and potassium ferrate. Compared with other chemical
oxidants, Fe(VI) has been found to be an environment-friendly powerful
oxidant over a wide pH range and a multifunctional water treatment
agent because of its high oxidation capacity, flocculation, disinfection,
and deodorization function. The standard reduction potential in acidic
pH is 2.20 V, whereas in basic pH this potential is about 0.72 V,
and it is potentially the strongest of all of the oxidants/disinfectants
realistically applicable to water and wastewater treatment.11−13 The reaction mechanism of Fe(VI) oxidation degradation of organic
pollutants is electrophilic oxidation reaction including 1-e– and 2-e– processes, which have been reported in
previous studies.14 Besides, Kamachi et
al.15 proposed the increasing oxidizing
power of the three types of Fe(VI) as FeO42– < HFeO4– < H2FeO4. Ohta et al.16,17 presented an argument through
chemical calculations that there are two reaction mechanisms for the
oxidation of methanol by Fe(VI), that is, addition–elimination
and direct extraction. Fe(VI) can be converted into nanoscale ferric
hydroxide during oxidation processes, which can be used as an alternative
iron source for the Fenton reaction.18,19 The addition
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can reduce the amount
of Fe(VI) and form Fenton-like reagents to further enhance the removal
of target contaminants. The Fenton oxidation process is based on the
nonselective oxidation ability of hydroxyl free radicals (HO•) generated from Fenton’s reagents. Owing to hydroxyl radicals’
high oxidation potential (E0 = 2.80 V),
they can oxidize almost all of the organic substances and mineralize
them to carbon dioxide and water. Its main reaction mechanism can
be described as follows20,21 1   2  However, using the traditional Fenton system
has several drawbacks, such as easy precipitation of iron ions, loss
of catalytic activity, and harsh environmental pH conditions.22,23 The Fe(VI)/H2O2 system can exert multiple functions, such as strong oxidation,
formation of Fenton-like reagents, and flocculation and precipitation,
to achieve efficient degradation of pollutants.

The main interest
of this study was to investigate the factors
that affect the degradation efficiency of DMP by Fe(VI)/H2O2 and to identify the flocculation and degradation intermediates
of DMP by the reaction system. The results show that Fe(VI)/H2O2 advanced oxidation process is an efficient catalytic
combustion technology for the destruction of DMP in water treatment.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Removal of DMP by a Single
Fe(VI)
To study the direct degradation of DMP by a single Fe(VI),
five groups of experiments with different initial Fe(VI) concentrations
were carried out and the results are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen, the removal efficiency
of DMP increases from 7.1 to 74.3% within the first 60 min when increasing
the molar ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[DMP] from 2:1 to 20:1. A gradual further
removal of DMP occurred in the next 120 min. The results show that
DMP can be effectively removed by the single Fe(VI) system. Preliminary
experimental results suggested that the concentration of DMP could
not be effectively reduced by the single H2O2 system. H2O2 with a low redox potential was
too easily decomposed to destroy the molecular structure of organic
pollutants. However, DMP can be removed effectively by the single
Fe(VI) system. Fe(VI) synergistically affected oxidization, coagulation,
sterilization, and deodorization during the water treatment process,
and its degradation product is iron hydroxide, which can further absorb
oxidation byproducts. In addition, various studies indicate that Fe(VI)
is a selective oxidizing agent that reacts with target compounds,
such as phenol, chlorophenol, 3-methylphenol benzene series, methyl tert-butyl ether, acetaminophen, trichloroethylene, methanol,
sulfite, and cyanide.24−29 In addition, the final product of Fe(VI) decomposition is ferric
iron (Fe(III) solid), which may play an important role in the subsequent
water treatment process, such as adsorption and coagulation.

of DMP by a single Fe(VI).

2.2 Effect of the Initial Fe(VI) Concentration
on the Degradation of DMP
Figure 2 shows the logarithmic graphs of Ct/Co in the presence
of Fe(VI) at different concentrations as a function of the reaction
time. The degradation of DMP generally can be regarded as a pseudo-first-order
kinetics reaction: ln Ct/Co = −kappt, where Co is the initial
concentration of the DMP solution, Ct is
the concentration of DMP at time t, and the slope kapp is the apparent reaction rate constant.
From the experimental results shown in Figure 2, the DMP removal efficiency increases from
6.3 to 89.7% when increasing the molar ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[DMP] from
1:1 to 10:1, and the corresponding pseudo-first-order kinetics constant
is improved from 0.00012 to 0.00623 min–1. However,
Fe(VI) shows a slightly increased DMP removal efficiency of 4.2% when
the molar ratio of Fe(VI)/[DMP] is up to 20:1. This phenomenon can
be attributed to the shielding of OH• by excessive
iron ions,30,31 as shown in eqs 3–5. Besides,
the reduction of ferrate in water is caused by oxygen radicals and
peroxide radicals. These radicals make ferrate become a strong oxidant
and ferric ions make it a good coagulant. During oxidation, ferrate
is reduced to Fe3+ or Fe(OH)3 and then flocculated.
However, excessive Fe(VI) may lead to enhanced flocculation and coprecipitation
of most organic high-molecular compounds.32 3   4   5

(pH =
7.0; molar ratio of [H2O2]/[DMP] = 2:1).

2.3 Effect
of the Initial H2O2 Concentration on the Degradation
of DMP
The concentration
of H2O2 is an important parameter in the advanced
oxidation process of Fe(VI)/H2O2. The effect
of the initial concentration of hydrogen peroxide on the degradation
of DMP was studied with the molar ratio of [H2O2]/[DMP] varying from 0.25:1 to 5:1. As shown in Figure 3, the kapp increases with the increase of the concentration of hydrogen
peroxide under the experimental conditions. The pseudo-first-order
rate constant can reach up to 0.00623 min–1 when
the molar ratio of [H2O2]/[DMP] is at levels
of up to 2:1. However, Fe(VI)/H2O2 exhibits
a slight increase in the dimethylformamide removal efficiency when
the molar ratio of [H2O2]/[DMP] rises from 2:1
to 5:1. In water, Fe(VI) is reduced to ferric iron (Fe(III)), which
might serve as an in situ coagulant. The self-decay of Fe(VI) to Fe(IV),
Fe(V), and H2O2 was catalyzed by the Fe(III)
precipitate,33 and H2O2 would further react with Fe(VI) to generate Fe(IV), which was also
catalyzed by the Fe(III) precipitate.34 Lee et al.35 studied the decomposition of Fe(VI) in phosphate-buffered
water at pH 7.0 and determined that H2O2, Fe(III),
and O2 were the main end products and that pseudo-first-order
rate constants (reaction of ferrate(VI) with H2O2) increased linearly with increasing H2O2 concentration
in the pH range of 7–12. These results indicate that the degradation
of DMP in the experimental system may be controlled by the amount
of hydroxyl radicals available. However, excessive hydrogen peroxide
could be used as a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals, thus reducing the
oxidation rate (eqs 6,7)36−38 6   7

of the initial H2O2 concentration
on DMP removal (pH = 7.0; molar ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[DMP] = 10:1).

2.4 Effect
of the Initial Solution pH on the Degradation
of DMP
The solution pH plays an important role in the oxidation
of organic contaminants by Fe(VI)/H2O2. The
effect of the solution pH on the degradation of DMP was studied in
the pH range of 3–11. As illustrated in Figure 4, the oxidation efficiency of DMP is affected
by the pH value because the acidity of the solution has a great influence
on the Fenton reaction. Obviously, the kapp value increases with the increase of the pH value in the range of
pH 3–5 and remains relatively stable in the pH range of 5–7.
However, the reaction rate constant decreases significantly with the
increase of the initial pH value under alkaline conditions. The effect
of the solution pH on the efficiency of DMP degradation in the Fe(VI)/H2O2 system may be caused by three factors: hydroxyl
radical production, hydroxyl radical scavenging, and stability of
Fe(VI). The hydrogen peroxide anion (HO2–) is an ionic form of hydrogen peroxide, which is more reactive than
hydrogen peroxide, and the alkaline condition is beneficial for the
enhanced formation of hydroxyl radicals (eq 8).39 8  Meanwhile, HO2– is also
a scavenger of HO• (eq 9) and promotes the decomposition of H2O2 (eq 10).40 Furthermore, the self-decomposition
rate of H2O2 also increases significantly with
the increase of the solution pH.41,42 9   10   11  In addition, Fe(VI) is extremely unstable
under strong acidic conditions (eq 11) and exhibits the greatest stability at about pH =
10.43 Rapid hydrolysis of Fe(VI) under
strong acidic conditions and the extremely high stability of Fe(VI)
under alkaline conditions will lead to low utilization of hydrogen
peroxide, which is not conducive to the degradation of pollutants.44 These competing processes together control the
concentration of hydroxyl radicals in the process of Fe(VI)/H2O2 advanced oxidation and make kapp increase with the increase of the solution pH and
then decrease gradually after reaching the peak value.

solution pH on DMP degradation, where the
molar ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2]/[DMP] =10:2:1.

2.5 Effect
of Coexisting Ions on the Degradation
of DMP
Real wastewater commonly contains metal ions and inorganic
anions; a solution containing the corresponding interfering ions (10
mg·L–1) was prepared and operated according
to the recommended procedure, and the results are shown in Figure 5. From the experimental
results, it can be seen that the effects of the six ions on DMP degradation
vary. The DMP removal
efficiency decreased slightly at different ion concentrations of K+ and SO42–. However, NO3–, Ca2+, HCO3–, and Mg2+ decreased the DMP removal efficiency significantly.
The DMP removal efficiency decreased about 14.3, 35.1, 81.1, and 84.5%
at 10 mg·L–1 of NO3–, Ca2+, HCO3–, and Mg2+, respectively. This can be attributed to the fact of that
these ions can react with the hydroxyl radical easily, which may lead
to a decrease of the DMP removal efficiency.45 In detail, bicarbonate may serve as a type of scavenger that can
quench hydroxyl radicals (eq 12). Nitrate ions and sulfate ions can also capture and react
with hydroxyl radicals, as shown in eq 13. In addition, the inhibiting effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ were consistent with previous studies, indicating
that hydroxide radicals would adhere to the surface of ferrite and
have adverse effects on iron oxidation.46 12   13

ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2]/[DMP] = 10:2:1).

2.6 Degradation
Intermediates and Degradation
Mechanism
Based on the identified intermediates in Figure S1 and Table S1, the proposed degradation
pathways are shown in Figure 6. Methyl phthalate was formed through direct oxidation and
hydrolysis of esters on the side of DMP. In a similar way, another
methoxy group was lost to form phthalic acid, which is further converted
into isophthalic acid by isomerization. Frontier electron density
analysis shows that the benzene ring is more vulnerable to free radical
attack when the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain is less
than three.47 Thus, benzoic acid was attacked
by free radicals to produce 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and 2,6-dihydroxybenzoic
acid, which had been confirmed by a prior report.48 Subsequently, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde and 2,6-dihydroxybenzaldehyde
are formed by further oxidation. The generated intermediates were
further decomposed to oxalic acid or other small molecular organic
acids and alcohols. Ultimately, the mineralization of DMP was completely
accomplished until almost all of the formed intermediates decompose
to CO2 and H2O.

3 Conclusions
This study illustrates that Fe(VI)/H2O2 can
effectively decompose and mineralize DMP in aqueous solutions. The
DMP removal efficiency was influenced by the Fe(VI) concentration,
H2O2 concentration, pH, and coexisting ions.
The optimal cost-effective conditions for the degradation of DMP in
the Fe(VI)/H2O2 system were observed at pH 7.0,
with an initial molar ratio of [Fe(VI)]/[H2O2]/[DMP] = 10:2:1. Also, Mg2+ and HCO3– in aqueous solutions could significantly decrease the DMP degradation
efficiency. Moreover, eight degradation intermediates were identified
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and possible
degradation pathways were proposed.

sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, sodium nitrate, sodium sulfite,
calcium chloride, sulfuric acid, sodium sulfate, hydrochloric acid,
acetic acid, sodium acetate, hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and ferrous
ammonium sulfate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagents (Shanghai,
China). Solid potassium ferrate (K2FeVIO4) and potassium bromide (spectrography) were purchased from
MACKLIN Reagent (Shanghai, China). Methanol and acetonitrile (HPLC
grade) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Methyl tert-butyl ether (GC grade), the GC derivatization reagent,

DMP stock solution (100 mg·L–1) was prepared
in ultrapure water.

4.2 DMP Degradation Experiments
Kinetic
experiments of DMP degradation with Fe(VI)/H2O2 were conducted in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks with stoppers in a thermostatic
shaker. Varying doses of Fe(VI), H2O2, and coexisting
ions were added in 100 mL of DMP aqueous solution (100 mg·L–1). After the reaction started, 1.0 mL of the DMP sample
was collected into a chromatography vial containing 200 μL of
sodium sulfite (0.10 M) to quench the free radical at reaction time
intervals of 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 min for the HPLC
analysis. The pH of test solutions was adjusted with 0.01 M H2SO4 and 0.01 M NaOH. All samples in the experiments
were filtered using 0.45 μm membrane filters. Each test was
conducted twice in the course of the experiment. The average values
of two DMP concentrations were taken as the current DMP concentrations
to calculate the reaction rate in each test.

4.3 Identification
of Degradation Products
Then, 1.0 mL of the DMP sample was
collected after 360 min and concentrated
by vacuum freeze-drying. The residue was dissolved in 4 mL of methyl
tertiary butyl ether and then derivatized by 0.2 mL of hexamethyldisilazane
and 0.1 mL of trimethylchlorosilane at 70 °C for 30 min before
it was filtered using 0.45 μm membrane filters. GC/MS was utilized
to analyze the degradation products.

4.4 Analytical

UV detector. The column utilized to separate the analytes was a C18
reversed-phase column SinChrom ODS-BP (5 μm, 4.6 × 250
mm2). The mobile phase consisted of water (30%) and methanol
(70%) and was eluted at 1.0 mL·min–1. The injection
volume was 20 mL and the detection wavelength was 225 nm. The degradation
products were detected using Thermo Trace1300 GC–MS with a
TG-5 MS capillary column. Nitrogen was the carrier gas with a flow
rate of 1 mL·min–1. The injector port was held
at 280 °C. The following procedure was applied to the column:
an initial oven temperature of 80 °C for 3 min, a ramp to 120
°C at 30 °C·min–1, then increasing
to 140 °C at 18 °C·min–1, followed
by a ramp to 250 °C at 30 °C·min–1, and finally maintained at 250 °C for 1 min.
