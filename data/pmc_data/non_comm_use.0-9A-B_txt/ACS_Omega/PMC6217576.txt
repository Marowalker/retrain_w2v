Exploring
aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) of gold nanoclusters
(Au NCs) is beneficial for extending their applications in sensing
and molecular information processing. Herein, we present the first
report of a protein-induced AEE effect of Au NCs. When human serum
albumin (HSA) is mixed with glutathione-capped Au NCs under appropriate
pH conditions, the Au NCs undergo extensive aggregation and exhibit
significantly enhanced emission, attributed to the electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions between HSA and the NCs. Such an AEE effect
is specific to serum albumin over a variety of other proteins, which
facilitates the development of a facile approach for HSA determination.
This sensing method displays satisfactory recoveries of 96.0–98.7%
when it is applied to HSA detection in artificial urine. Moreover,
the AEE effect is suited to the fabrication of AND and INHIBIT logic
gates by using HSA and pH/protein-binding drug as inputs and the emission
as output.

1 Introduction
Ligand-capped
luminescent gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) have attracted
extensive attention for facile syntheses, high photostability, and
good biocompatibility. Particularly, the luminescence of Au NCs can
readily be modified using various analytes, including metal cations,
inorganic anions, and biomolecules, which provide a basis for developing
sensing methods for chemical/biological detection.1−6 In most of the cases, interactions between the Au NCs and analytes
cause luminescence quenching of the NCs. For example, several Hg2+-ion-sensing methods have been designed by using the effective
luminescence quenching of Au NCs through metallophilic Hg2+–Au+ interactions.7−9 Chemical oxidation also
causes the luminescence quenching of Au NCs, which can be used for
sensing CN– and H2O2.10,11 Recently, a limited but increasing number of studies have focused
on the luminescence enhancement of Au NCs for sensing application.
For example, Banerjee et al. report an As3+ ion assay based
on the luminescence enhancement of dicysteine-capped Au NCs through
the formation of a charge-transfer complex.12 Liu et al. develop a strategy for cysteine determination based on
the enhanced emission of protein-capped Au NCs induced by attachment
of cysteine on the NC surfaces.13

Aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) is an intriguing optical phenomenon
in which weakly luminescent species display remarkably enhanced emission
in their aggregated states.14,15 While AEE is usually
observed for organic molecules, it was demonstrated very recently
that Au NCs also exhibit the AEE effect. For example, Pei et al. reported
the AEE of Au NCs induced by Pb2+ ions,16 while Zhou et al. reported a similar phenomenon induced
by Ag+ ions.17 Yahia-Ammar et
al. demonstrated the AEE effect of Au NCs resulting from electrostatic
interactions with cationic polymers, such as poly(allylamine hydrochloride)
and polyethylenimine.18

Human serum
albumin (HSA) is a vital protein for human beings since
it regulates intravascular osmotic pressure and transports bioactive
molecules such as vitamins, hormones, and drugs in bloodstream. For
a healthy person, HSA is normally present in blood rather than in
urine due to filtering by the kidneys. However, when the kidneys are
damaged, high levels of HSA are presented in urine, which is referred
to as “albuminuria” and is a key clinical indicator
of diabetes, renal, and cardiovascular diseases.19 Herein, we reported the first study using protein, that
is, HSA, to induce the aggregation of glutathione-capped Au NCs (GSH–Au
NCs), which, in turn, significantly enhanced the emission of the NCs.
By taking advantage of the AEE effect, we developed a luminescence
enhancement strategy for protein detection, which showed excellent
sensitivity and selectivity for serum albumin over a variety of other
proteins. Furthermore, molecular logic gates capable of performing
AND and INHIBIT operations were fabricated based on the AEE effect.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Aggregation-Enhanced Emission
of GSH–Au
NCs in the Presence of HSA
GSH–Au NCs were prepared
following Xie’s method.20 The as-prepared
Au NCs exhibited absorption/emission bands around 390/618 nm, respectively
(Figure S1). A dispersion of GSH–Au
NCs in phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) exhibited weak luminescence while
being irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light, which was significantly
enhanced upon the addition of HSA (Figure 1A). The luminescence enhancement of the NCs
by HSA was then studied by monitoring the dependence of the enhancement
factor, I/I0, with incubation
time, where I and I0 represent
luminescent emission intensities of the NCs at 618 nm with and without
HSA, respectively. Figure 1B reveals that the I/I0 value increased rapidly and plateaued over 15 min following
the addition of HSA, while the luminescence of the Au NC dispersion
remained unchanged in the absence of HSA, which highlighted the vital
role played by HSA in enhancing the emission of the NCs.

(D) UV–vis spectra of the Au NC dispersion with and without
HSA. Inset gives the corresponding transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) micrographs of the NC without (a) and with (b) HSA. HSA concentration
was set to be 500 nM in all the experiments.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis indicates that the
hydrodynamic
diameter of the GSH–Au NC was ca. 4 nm, which increased significantly
to ca. 570 nm upon the addition of HSA (Figure 1C), implying that the Au NCs may undergo
extensive aggregation in the presence of HSA. TEM study reveals the
NCs were well dispersed and ∼1.1 nm in size, while large aggregates
with sizes of ∼60.9 nm were obtained upon the addition of HSA
(inset, Figure 1D).
The larger hydrodynamic diameters derived from DLS measurements than
those determined by TEM observations are related to the presence of
hydration shells around the Au NCs and the aggregates in aqueous media.
Moreover, the UV–vis absorption spectra displayed in Figure 1D reveal a noticeable
increase in background scattering in the absorbance of the Au NC dispersion
after the introduction of HSA. Correspondingly, the transparent dispersion
of GSH–Au NCs became slightly turbid after the addition of
HSA (Figure S2) attributed to the aggregation
of the NCs, which accounted for the increased background scattering
in the UV–vis absorption spectrum. Moreover, the characteristic
surface plasmon resonance peak of gold nanoparticles ∼520 nm
did not appear in the UV–vis absorption spectrum, which excluded
the formation of large gold nanoparticles upon mixing the GSH–Au
NCs with HSA. These results were consistent with the AEE of Au NCs
induced by polymers and metal ions.16−18

2.2 Possible
Mechanism for the HSA-Induced AEE
of GSH–Au NCs
Electrostatic interactions are essential
for driving the polymer/metal cation-induced aggregation of metal
nanoclusters.17,18 In our case, ζ-potential
measurements reveal that GSH–Au NCs were negatively charged
at pH 3.0–9.0, while HSA is an acidic protein with an isoelectric
point (pI) of 4.7 (Figure 2A). Figure 2B shows that both I/I0 and the hydrodynamic diameters of the Au NCs following
the addition of HSA were highly pH dependent. A maximum I/I0 value of 3.3 was observed at pH 4.0,
in which electrostatic attractions between the negatively charged
Au NCs (−4.8 mV) and the positively charged HSA (4.3 mV) lead
to the aggregation of the NCs, followed by the enhanced luminescence.
When pH of the dispersion was set to be 3.0, at which the Au NCs were
less charged, or to 5.0, at which the HSA was less charged, obvious
decreases in I/I0 were
observed, owing to the limited electrostatic attraction. The AEE effect
was negligible at pH value higher than 6.0 since both the NCs and
HSA were negatively charged at the high pH. Hence, we deduced that
electrostatic interactions between the GSH–Au NCs and the HSA
played important roles in inducing the AEE effect.

pH conditions. (B) Variations of the enhancement factor, I/I0, and hydrodynamic diameters of the
NCs in the presence of HSA, with pH. HSA concentration was set to
be 500 nM in all the experiments.

The effect of other protein with pI similar
to
or higher than that of HSA, including ovalbumin (4.7), carbonic anhydrase
(CA, 6.1), immunoglobulin G (IgG, 6.6), hemoglobin (Hb, 6.8), lipase
(6.9), horseradish peroxidase (HRP, 7.2), trypsin (8.7), RNase A (9.2),
lysozyme (Lys, 10.8) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, 4.7), on the enhancement
factor was further evaluated to understand the AEE effect. After being
added into aqueous dispersions of the GSH–Au NCs at pH 4.0,
as shown in Figure 3A, only HSA and BSA, a highly structural and functional analogue
of HSA, can lead to the significant emission enhancement of GSH–Au
NCs, while other proteins only induced slight changes in the enhancement
factor. The fact that other proteins, except serum albumin, failed
to trigger the AEE of GSH–Au NC indicated that electrostatic
interactions between protein and the NCs alone are insufficient to
promote the AEE effect. In addition to electrostatic attraction, it
is likely that there exist other driving forces to contribute to the
AEE effect, which appear to be specific for serum albumin.

without the Au NCs. (C) Luminescence decay and (D) X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) profiles of the Au NCs with and without HSA. Concentrations
of all the proteins were set to be 500 nM in these experiments.

Serum albumin is a typical protein
with several hydrophobic pockets
and can bind to many organic probes through hydrophobic interactions.21−27 Circular dichroism (CD) spectra measurement was performed to further
investigate the interaction of HSA with the Au NCs. As shown in Figure 3B, HSA had two negative
CD bands ∼208 and 218 nm, corresponding to the α-helical
structure in protein.23 While after HSA
was mixed with a dispersion of GSH–Au NCs at pH 4.0, the bands
at 208 and 218 nm almost disappeared, while a positive band emerged
at 200 nm and a negative band appeared around 230 nm, highlighting
the substantial change in the secondary structure of the protein,
which was caused by the interaction of HSA with the NCs. Contents
of the secondary structures calculated from the CD spectrum of HSA
were 50% for α-helix, 12% for β-sheet, 13% for β-turn,
and 25% for random coil. After being mixed with the NC dispersion,
the content of α-helix decreased dramatically to 9%, while those
of β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil increased to 37, 25,
and 29%, respectively. Such changes in secondary structure suggested
that the Au NCs possibly bound HSA through hydrophobic interactions.27,28 The hydrophobic interaction of HSA with GSH–Au NCs was further
illustrated by a control experiment, in which the enhanced Au NC emission
induced by HSA was greatly suppressed in the presence of guanidine
hydrochloride (GdnHCl), a denaturation agent that destroys the hydrophobic
interaction between proteins and organic probes (Figure S3).22 Accordingly, the
specific HSA-induced AEE effect of the Au NCs was possibly ascribable
to the greater hydrophobicity of HSA compared to most of the other
proteins.29

Time-resolved luminescence
and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
were acquired in order to shed light on the AEE effect. Decay curve
of the Au NCs was fitted by a triexponential function, with lifetimes
of 0.35 μs (18.03%), 1.14 μs (47.85%), and 4.68 μs
(34.12%) (Figure 3C).
Such microsecond-level lifetimes indicated that emission of GSH–Au
NC came from ligand-to-metal charge transfer/ligand-to-metal–metal
charge transfer, which resulted in radiative relaxation.20,30 The lifetimes of the Au NCs were extended to 0.47 μs (13.14%),
2.17 μs (46.15%), and 7.18 μs (40.71%) in the presence
of HSA. Such prolonged decay times indicated the suppressed ligand-related
nonradiative relaxation in the excited state, which might contribute
to the strikingly enhanced emission of the NCs induced by HSA.18,20 Moreover, Au 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 XPS peaks of
the Au NCs centered at 88.1 and 84.3 eV (Figure 3D), which indicated the presence of Au(0)
and Au(I) in the NCs. Upon the addition of HSA, these peaks shifted
to 83.5 and 86.9 eV, suggesting transformation of a part of the Au(I)
into Au(0), which might also contribute to the AEE effect.31

2.3 Method for HSA Determination
Based on the
AEE Effect
Based on the HSA-induced AEE of the Au NCs, a
luminescence method for quantitative determination of HSA was developed. Figure 4A reveals that emission
intensities of the NCs increased with the increasing HSA concentration. Figure 4B shows that the
emission enhancement factor, I/I0, is almost linear with the HSA concentration from 10
to 500 nM. The detection limit was ∼1.6 nM, estimated by the
IUPAC method, which was comparable to those of organic probe-based
luminescence methods used for detecting HSA (Table S1).21−25 However, this present method is more facile and environment-friendly
since no toxic organic solvents are required in the operations either
to prepare the NCs or to detect the protein.

spectra and (B) enhancement factor, I/I0, of GSH–Au NCs upon
the addition of HSA (0–1000 nM). Inset provides the linear
calibration plot for HSA detection (y = 0.0045x – 0.01, R2 = 0.99).
(C) Histogram of I/I0 upon the addition of Na+ ions (30 mM), K+ ions
(30 mM), NH4+ ions (30 mM), Ca2+ ions
(3.0 mM), Mg2+ ions (3.0 mM), glucose (25 mM), creatinine
(Cre, 0.5 mM), uric acid (20 mM), urea (0.2 M), cysteine (Cys, 500
nM), homocysteine (Hcy, 500 nM), glutathione (GSH, 500 nM), oxidized
glutathione (GSSH), and HSA (500 nM).

The influence of a variety of biologically relevant substances,
including metal ions and bioactive small molecules, on emission intensities
of the nanoclusters was then evaluated. Figure 4C reveals that the influence of these substances
on emission intensities of the NCs was almost negligible. Consequently,
this method should be capable of sensing HSA in practical samples,
such as artificial urine. In a typical experiment, 100 μL of
artificial urine was spiked with defined concentrations of HSA, and
then the mixtures were analyzed by using the AEE-based assay as well
as a classical bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. The results obtained
from the concentration calibration curve (Figure S4) for the AEE-based assay were consistent with those acquired
using the BCA method (Table S2). In addition,
our method exhibited excellent recoveries (96.0–98.7%) and
relative standard deviations (<5.0%), highlighting its potential
use for HSA detection in real samples.

2.4 AEE-Based
Design of Molecular Logic Gates
Logic gates that transform
chemical/biological input into measurable
output have attracted significant attention due to potential applications
to information processing at the molecular level.32,33 Based on the AEE effect associated with the Au NCs induced by HSA,
we designed a platform capable of performing molecular logic operations.
To implement the logic function, AEE-related factors such as HSA and
pH (H+, OH–) were employed as inputs.
The absence and presence of the input were designated to be “0”
and “1”, respectively. On the other hand, the weak luminesce
associated with dispersed GSH–Au NCs was defined to be output
0, while the enhanced emission associated with the Au NC-HSA aggregates
was defined to be output 1, with a threshold I/I0 value of 2.0. As shown in Figure 5, an AND gate that provides
an output of 1 when both inputs are 1 was fabricated using the pH-dependent
AEE effect. The Au NC dispersion at pH 7.0 was defined to be the initial
state. The two inputs for the AND gate were set to be HSA and H+. The Au NCs exhibited poor luminescence without any input
(output 0). The addition of a single input, either HSA or H+ ions, into the Au NC dispersion (pH 7.0) was unable to trigger the
AEE effect (output 0). Only when both inputs, that is, HSA and H+, were added simultaneously was AEE observed (output 1), which
supported an AND function that transforms biochemical information,
that is, the presence of HSA and environmental pH change, into a detectable
luminescence signal.

AND
logic gate. (B) Luminescence emission spectra, (C) I/I0, and (D) truth table for the AEE-based
AND logic gate.

An INHIBIT gate, in which
the output is 1 when only one input is
1 (and the other input is 0), was constructed next. As shown in Figure 6, the initial state
of the INHIBIT gate was set to be the GSH–Au NC dispersion
at pH 4.0. HSA was used as one input and OH– as
the other. The GSH–Au NCs exhibited AEE with only HSA as the
input, to give an output signal of 1. The addition of OH– alone resulted in negligible change of the weak luminesces of the
GSH–Au NCs (output 0). However, when the gate was subjected
to both inputs together, AEE was inhibited by the neutral pH condition
caused by the addition of OH– (output 0); hence,
this configuration corresponded to an INHIBIT logic gate. The OH– ions can be replaced by another input capable of suppressing
the AEE effect when designing INHIBIT gates. For example, an AEE-based
INHIBIT gate can also be designed using ketoprofen instead of OH– ions as an input. Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug that can competitively bind to HSA,27,34 thereby preventing interactions between HSA and the NCs (Figures 6A and S5). Considering that HSA is a model protein
in molecular biology, the AEE-based INHIBIT gate might be potentially
useful for the screening of drugs and the evaluation of their physiological
activities.

logic gate. (B) Luminescence emission spectra, (C) I/I0, and (D) truth table for the AEE-based
INHIBIT logic gate.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate that HSA is effective to induce the
aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) of GSH–Au NCs. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study of a protein-triggered AEE
effect of the Au NCs. It is identified that both hydrophobic and electrostatic
interactions between HSA and the Au NCs contribute to the AEE effect.
Such an AEE effect involving the Au NCs is suitable for the detection
of HSA. Moreover, molecular platforms capable of performing AND and
INHIBIT logic operations are fabricated based on the AEE effect. We
expect that this study will provide new insight into protein sensing
and offers an experimental basis for the future development of logic
devices for molecular information processing and biomedical research.
