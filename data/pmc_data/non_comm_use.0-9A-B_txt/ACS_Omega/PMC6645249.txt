We
report results of our study on the mechanism of spin-dependent
O2 binding to hemoglobin, which we represent as FePIm (Fe
= iron, P = porphyrin, Im = imidazole). This involves the transition
between two states, viz., the oxyhemoglobin state and the deoxyhemoglobin
state. The deoxyhemoglobin state pertains to FePIm and a free O2 molecule, while the oxyhemoglobin state pertains to an O2 bound to FePIm. The deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin systems
have triplet and singlet total magnetizations, respectively. We found
that a spin transition from triplet to quintet to singlet mediates
the O2 binding process, and this accelerates the reaction.
We also found that the position of the Fe atom out of the porphyrin
plane is an important indicator of O2 affinity.

==== Body
Introduction
Hemoglobin is an iron-containing oxygen-transport
metalloprotein
in the red blood cells of vertebrates. O2 binds to the
hemoglobin at high concentrations and desorbs at low concentrations,
as it is transported throughout the body. This reversible O2 binding process has been studied both theoretically and experimentally.1−3 Previous studies show that the electronic structure of the hemoglobin’s
active site, that is, heme, plays an important role in determining
oxygen affinity.4,5 A heme group consists of an iron
(Fe) atom held in a heterocyclic ring, known as porphyrin. The porphyrin
ring consists of four pyrrole (C4H4NH) molecules,
cyclically linked together by methine (=CH−) bridges,
with the Fe atom bound in the center. Fe atom coordinates with four
N atoms in the center of the ring, which all lie in the plane. Fe
covalently binds to the globular protein via the N atom of the imidazole
((CH)2N(NH)CH) ring of (F8) histidine residue below the
porphyrin plane. In addition, it is well known that metals, such as
Fe, determine the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of
metalloproteins. Thus, it is important to examine the metal complex
composed of Fe atom (=heme) in order to clarify the physical properties
of heme protein.

Oxygen affinity to hemoglobin has been studied
experimentally using
two model systems. One involves the substitution of the amino acid
residue, and the other involves substitution of the heme itself by
a similarly modified heme. The former is suitable for studying the
regulation of delicate physiological reactions.6,7 The
latter is used to improve or to introduce new functions.8 In this study, we focus on the former and represent
the hemoglobin using FePIm (P = porphyrin, Im = imidazole), as shown
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Model system. R: the distance between the Fe atom
and the O1 atom. d: the distance of the Fe atom from
the porphyrin plane.

The electronic structures of deoxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin
have been theoretically studied.9,10 In the deoxyhemoglobin
state, we have FePIm and a free O2 molecule (Figure 2). In this state, the O2–FePIm distance R = 7.21 Å and
the distance of the Fe atom from the porphyrin plane d = 0.18 Å. The total magnetization (spin multiplicity) of the
deoxyhemoglobin state M = 1 μB (S = 3) [Fe (sz = 2) + O2 (sz = −1)].11 On the other hand, in
the oxyhemoglobin state, we have an O2 attached to FePIm
(Figure 3). The O2–FePIm distance R = 1.84 Å and
the distance of the Fe atom from the porphyrin plane d = 0.01 Å. The total magnetization in the oxyhemoglobin state
is M = 0 μB (S =
1) [Fe (sz = −1/2)
+ O2 (sz =
1/2)]. Thus, we see that reversible O2 binding involves
spin transitions. In this study, we analyzed the change in the spin
multiplicity from the initial state to the final state, through various
possible intermediate states. We also studied the structural change
and energetics, to understand how these factors affect O2 affinity.

Materials and Methods
We performed spin-polarized density
functional theory (DFT)-based
calculations as implemented by the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP),12−15 using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation
functional,16 energy cutoff of 400 eV,
and a (1 × 1 × 1) gamma centered grid. The projector augmented
wave method was used to describe the ionic cores. All atoms were relaxed
in ionic calculations with an optimization criterion of 0.01 meV/Å
inside a 20 × 20 × 27 Å3 supercell. We adopted
the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method for finding
the saddle points and minimum energy paths between the initial state
(deoxyhemoglobin state) and the final state (oxyhemoglobin state).17

Results and Discussion
Optimized Geometry
First, we study how the geometry
of O2 binding changes from the initial deoxyhemoglobin
state to the final oxyhemoglobin state (Figures 2 and 3), using CINEB
with 4 intermediate states. Table 1 shows the parameters defining the geometry of the
deoxyhemoglobin and the oxyhemoglobin states, including the intermediate
states. Θ gives the angle subtended by the imidazole plane with
the –Z-axis. The optimized structure
obtained from this study (Table 1) agrees with experimental results.18 We observed an elongated O1–O2, at a distance of R = 2.40 Å from Fe, in the intermediate state. This
suggests the potential use of FePIm as a catalyst for O2 dissociation, for example, as a cathode electrode in polymer electrolyte
fuel cells (PEFCs),19−22 where the oxygen reduction reaction takes place. However, we still
need to consider how we can overcome the high activation energy barrier
associated with this reaction.

In the deoxyhemoglobin state, the Fe atom
lies at a distance d = 0.18 Å out of the porphyrin
plane, which is larger
than in the oxyhemoglobin state (d = 0.01 Å). Table 1 shows that d decreases as the system changes from the deoxyhemoglobin
state to the oxyhemoglobin state. d = 0.15 Å
and remains constant when 2.40 Å < R <
4.24 Å. d suddenly decreases to d = 0.01 Å at the oxyhemoglobin state, when R < 2.40 Å. We found a similar trend for the distance Fe–ImN.
For Fe–porphyrin without imidazole, the Fe atom lies in the
porphyrin plane, that is, d = 0 Å. Because of
the interaction between the imidazole and the porphyrin, the Fe atom
moves out of the porphyrin plane. The interaction between the Fe (dxy) orbital and the N atom
in the porphyrin plane shows antibonding character (Figure 2). With O2 interacting
with the Fe atom of the FePIm through the σ-bond between the
Fe (dz2) orbital
and O2 (π) orbital, the electron in the Fe (dxy) orbital flips its spin
and moves to the Fe (dyz) orbital. Because the Fe (dxy) orbital is now empty, the antibonding interaction between
the Fe (dxy) orbital
and the N (π) orbital vanishes. Therefore, the Fe–ImN
distance and d becomes shorter, 2.04 and 0.01 Å,
respectively. As O2 approaches the Fe atom, the subtended
angle Θ decreases, and we find O1, Fe, and N forming a linear
arrangement.

Spin Multiplicity of O2 Binding
To understand
the O2 binding process, we investigated the adsorption
energy as a function of the corresponding O1–Fe distance R, starting with the deoxyhemoglobin state through to the
oxyhemoglobin state (Figure 4). As reference, we took the corresponding energy of the deoxyhemoglobin
state at R = 7.21 Å. We found an activation
barrier 0.38 eV for O2 binding and 0.92 eV for O2 desorption. These values are high for a reversible O2 binding process, as suggested by other studies.23

Figure 4 Adsorption energy and magnetization as a function of R: distance between Fe and O2. Adsorption energy is given
in units of electron volts (eV) relative to the corresponding total
energy of the deoxyhemoglobin state at R = 7.21 Å.
Magnetization is given in units of μB (Bohr magneton).
Positive magnetization corresponds to dominance of majority spin electrons.

In Figure 4, we
see that at R = 7.21 Å, Fe and O2 have corresponding magnetizations M = 2.128 μB and M = −1.446 μB, respectively. We round each magnetization (spin multiplicity) to
the nearest integer and then sum them up to get the total magnetization.
This means that the total magnetization in the deoxyhemoglobin state
M ≈ 1 μB (S = 3) [Fe (sz = 2),
O2 (sz = −1)].
At R = 4.24 Å, the unpaired electrons in the
O2 (π*) orbital flip its spin state and the corresponding
magnetizations of Fe and O2 become M =
2.145 μB and M = 1.443 μB. At R = 4.24 Å, the total magnetization M ≈ 3 μB (S = 7)
[Fe (sz = 2), O2 (sz = 1)]. This change
in the total magnetization can be attributed to the magnetic coupling
between Fe and O2, which has been estimated in a non-heme
Fe–O2 interaction in the superoxo form.24 We found a small difference in the magnetization
of Fe, as R decreases from 7.21 to 3.43 Å. This
indicates weak interaction between Fe and O2, when the R > 3.43 Å. Furthermore, the small energy difference
going from R = 7.21 Å to R =
3.43 Å (Figure 4) indicates degenerate triplet (R = 7.21, 5.33 Å)
and septet (R = 3.43, 4.24 Å) states. At an
O2 distance of R = 2.4 Å, the Fe
and O2 magnetizations become M = 2.149
μB and M = −0.454 μB, respectively (Figure 5). This corresponds to a total magnetization M ≈ 2 μB (S = 5) [Fe (sz = 2), O2 (sz = 0)]. We can also confirm
that O2 changes to the singlet state, because the distance
O1–O2 is larger than that of the triplet state (Table 1). As O2 approaches
FePIm, the electron in the Fe (dxy) orbital flips its spin state and moves to the Fe (dyz) orbital, and the electron
in the Fe (dxz) orbital
flips its spin state, when the spin multiplicity converts from quintet
to singlet in Figure 6. Finally, in the oxyhemoglobin state (R = 1.84
Å), the O2 molecule binds with the FePIm forming σ-bond
between Fe (dz2) orbital and O2 (π*) orbital. The magnetizations
of Fe atom and O2 molecule are M = −0.679
μB and M = 0.53 μB, which means the total magnetization at the final (oxyhemoglobin)
state M ≈ 0 μB (S = 1) [Fe (sz = −1/2),
O2 (sz = 1/2)].
In summary, we found that the O2 adsorption on the FePIm
process involves a change in total spin multiplicity from triplet
(septet) to quintet to singlet.

Figure 5 Change in the electronic structure from R = 3.43
Å to R = 1.84 Å. At R =
3.43 Å, the system has a septet total spin multiplicity (S = 7), when O2 has two spin up (sz = 1) electrons, and triplet total spin
multiplicity (S = 3), when O2 has two
spin down (sz = −1)
electrons. We use the notation “triplet (septet)” to
indicate the degeneracy of the septet (S = 7) state
and the triplet (S = 3) states. The total spin multiplicity
changes from triplet (septet) → quintet → singlet.

and R (Å). R represents the

plane. Blue line represents the minimum energy path from R = 3.43 Å to R = 1.84 Å. The darker color

Relation between Energy
and Spin Crossing
To study
how the spin state affects the activation energy barrier, we calculated
the corresponding energies of the system at fixed O2 spin
states, that is, adsorption where O2 is in a singlet and
triplet state, as shown in Figures 6 and 7, repectively. We can
observe that the O2 binding  on the FePIm in the septet
state is stable when the d and R values are large. On the other hand, the O2 binding 
on the FePIm in the singlet state is stable when the d and R values are small. With that, we found that
the distances d (between the imidazole and Fe) and R (between Fe and O2) are two important
reaction coordinates that can be used to control O2 affinity.
We also observe that the activation energy barrier of the O2 binding process in the septet (S = 7) state is
0.82 eV, while that of the O2 desorption process in the
singlet (S = 1) state is 1.46 eV  (Figure 8). However, because
of the spin crossing from septet (S = 7) to singlet
(S = 1) state, the activation energy barrier of the
O2 binding becomes 0.02 eV and that of the O2 desorption becomes 1.23 eV. Therefore, we found that the spin crossing
is also an important factor that affects the activation energy barrier.
Interestingly, other studies suggest that in metal–oxygen complexes,
antiferromagnetic exchange may also affect reactivity.24 We conducted this calculation with fixed total
spin multiplicity in the septet (S = 7) and singlet
(S = 1) state. However, the calculation with CINEB
is conducted with optimization. This accounts for the difference in
activation energy barriers found in Figures 4 and 8.

Conclusions
We studied spin-dependent O2 binding on FePIm using
DFT-based calculations. We found that as O2 approaches
the Fe atom, binding between O1 and O2 weakens, particularly at distances R < 3.43 Å. This hints at the potential application
of FePIm as PEFC catalysts. In the deoxyhemoglobin state, the Fe atom
protrudes a distance of 0.18 Å out of the porphyrin plane. On
the other hand, in the oxyhemoglobin state, the Fe atom protrudes
a distance of 0.01 Å from the porphyrin plane. These results
are in good agreement with experimental results. As O2 approaches
the Fe atom, the electron in the Fe (dxy) orbital flips its spin state and moves to the
Fe (dyz) orbital. Because
of the absence of electrons in the Fe (dxy), the antibonding interaction between the Fe (dxy) orbital and the N (π)
orbital vanishes. This explains the movement of the Fe atom towards
the porphyrin plane, when the O2 approaches. This also
indicates that the position of Fe atom from the porphyrin plane is
an important reaction coordinate that can be used to control O2 affinity.

We also investigated the minimum energy pathway
from the deoxyhemoglobin
state to the oxyhemoglobin state. We found that the activation barrier
for O2 binding is 0.38 eV, while that for O2 desorption is 0.92 eV. We also found that the total spin multiplicity
upon O2 adsorption changes. At the initial state (deoxyhemoglobin
state), the total magnetization is M = 1 μB (S = 3) [Fe (sz = 2) + O2 (sz = −1)]. At the distance of R = 2.4 Å, the total magnetization changes to M = 2 μB (S = 5) [Fe (sz = 2) + O2 (sz = 0)]. Finally, at the oxyhemoglobin
state, the total magnetization is M = 0 μB (S = 1) [Fe (sz = −1/2) + O2 (sz = 1/2)]. These spin crossings are important
for obtaining the minimum energy pathway of the O2 binding
process as we confirmed that spin crossing affects the activation
energy barrier.
