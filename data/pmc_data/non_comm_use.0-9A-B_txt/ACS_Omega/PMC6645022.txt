We explore the applicability of graphynes,
two-dimensional carbon
sheets with sp- and sp2-bonds, as sodium (Na)-ion battery
anodes using first-principles density functional theory. We found
that voltages attainable from the charging–discharging of Na
into multilayer graphyne are proper for use as anodes. The composite
is ∼C6Na2 at the maximum Na concentration,
corresponding to gravimetric and volumetric capacities of ∼837
mAh g–1 and ∼1056 mAh cm–3, respectively. These are significantly greater than the corresponding
values (372 mAh g–1 and 818 mAh cm–3) of graphite for lithium. We ascribe the enhancement of the capacities
to their nanoporous structures with sp- and sp2-bonded
carbon atoms, which effectively bind multiple Na atoms. We propose
that sp–sp2 carbon sheets can be promising candidates
for high-capacity Na-ion battery anodes.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The lithium-ion battery
(LIB) is one of the widely used batteries
for portable electronics because of its high energy density and safe
source of power. Graphite has been widely employed as an LIB anode
material because the device with graphite anode has demonstrated high
power density with a high stability for lithium intercalation (small
volume change), and a gravimetric capacity that is as large as 372
mAh g–1.1−4 However, lithium is an expensive element, increasing
the overall cost of the materials for the commercialization of LIBs.5 In contrast, sodium is a low-cost element because
of its abundance6 (Na: 0.09–0.46
$/kg, Li: 5.09–5.56 $/kg) and is the second lightest element
among the alkali metal elements.

Recently, sodium (Na)-ion batteries
(SIBs) have been considered
as cost-effective batteries replacing LIBs. However, unlike LIBs,
the relevant negative electrodes (anodes) are yet to be found, and
graphite cannot be used as an insertion host material of Na ions.
This could be generated from the difference between Na and Li: the
ionic radius (0.97 Å) of Na is much larger than that of Li (0.68
Å) and the ionization potential of Na is lower than that of Li
by 0.25 eV, inhibiting Na interaction with graphite, unlike Li.7,8 Recent studies have been performed on the possible candidates for
the anodes of SIBs, such as hard carbons (nongraphitizable carbon),
some oxides, p-block elements, sulfides, and tin.9−17 However, these materials have several issues such as their poor
reversibility.

We explored the possibility of using multilayer
graphynes (graphyne
is an sp–sp2 hybrid carbon atomic layer consisting
of sp2-carbon atoms and acetylene groups (−C≡C−)),
which are layered-structured materials. γ-Graphyne is semiconducting
with a band gap of 0.47 eV18 and has the
lowest energy among sp–sp2 carbon sheets and a higher
energy than graphene or graphite by 0.63 eV atom–1.19 Detailed information on the geometrical
and electronic structures of extensive sp–sp2 carbon
sheets is provided in the literature.19 For the anodes of SIBs, we consider two-dimensional layers of sp-
and sp2-bonded carbon atoms. This is because they are expected
to have a small volume change due to their layered structures and
are high-power anodes due to the high mobility of the Na atom between
layers. In addition, the feasibility of multilayered graphyne and
graphdiyne for high-capacity and high-mobility anodes of LIBs has
already been demonstrated.20−23 Certain criteria are required of candidates for anodes
of SIBs. (1) The average voltage by sodiation/desodiation should range
from ∼0 to 1.5 V when a Na metal bulk is used as an electrode
connected to Na-intercalated systems. (2) In addition, the gravimetric
and volumetric capacities should be as high as those of graphite for
the anode of LIBs, which are 372 mAh g–1 and 818
mAh cm–3, respectively. Here, we searched for new
anodes of SIBs based on multilayer sp–sp2 carbon
sheets, graphyne, meeting the criteria for the anodes of SIBs. On
the other hand, progress has been made in the synthesis of these anodes:
sp–sp2 carbon sheets such as graphynes were synthesized
using a bottom-up method24 and graphdiyne,
which is made up of sp2-carbon atoms and diacetylene groups
(−C≡C–C≡C−), was made in the form
of powders and flakes.25−27 Carbon ene–yne, a carbon layer structure consisting
of diacetylene groups and sp2 carbon atoms, was also successfully
synthesized in a film form.28 More recently,
an ultrathin graphdiyne film on graphene was synthesized using solution-phase
van der Waals epitaxy method.29 These results
suggest that new carbon allotropes of sp–sp2 carbon
sheets could be synthesized.

2 Computational Details
Our calculations using the density functional theory30 were carried out with the Vienna ab initio simulation
package using a projector-augmented-wave method.31 The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
scheme32 was employed and the kinetic energy
cutoff was set at 400 eV. We employed a 2 × 2 hexagonal supercell
graphyne system containing 48 carbon atoms. During geometrical optimization
of Na-dispersed graphynes, its equilibrium lattice constant was fixed
equal to the isolated 2 × 2 graphyne. The geometrical optimization
was performed until the Hellmann–Feynman force acting on each
atom was less than 0.01 eV Å–1. The first Brillouin
zone integration was performed adopting the Monkhorst–Pack
scheme.33 A 4 × 4 × 1 k-point sampling was performed for the 2 × 2 graphynes.
To remove spurious interactions between periodic images because of
periodic calculations by the long-range Coulomb interaction, the vacuum
layer in each of the nonperiodic directions was ∼10 Å.

3 Results and Discussion
To explore the SIB anodes, we
considered γ-graphyne for the
Na adsorption material, in which there are hexagonal and triangular
geometries made up of sp- and sp2-bonded carbons. γ-Graphyne
was found to be the most stable among the sp–sp2 carbon atomic layers.34−37 Hereafter, we use “graphyne” to refer
to “γ-graphyne”. We performed calculations on
the Na atom attached to a single-layer graphyne to determine the optimal
adsorption location and to investigate the adsorption principle. We
found that Na adsorption depends only on the local geometries such
as hexagon and triangle sites. Figure 1a,b show the atomic structures of the Na-dispersed
graphynes with a 2 × 2 supercell when a Na atom is bound to a
hexagon and triangle site, respectively. For convenience in comparison
with the existing graphitic anode materials, the C48Nan is reduced to C6Nax. The binding energy of Na atoms is defined by Ebindx(Na) =
(Ec + N · ENa – EC–Nax)/N, where N is the number of Na atoms attached
per 2 × 2 supercell for a given x, EC–Nax is the total energy of Na dispersed in a 2 ×
2 graphyne with x concentration of Na atoms, Ec is the total energy of a 2 × 2 isolated
graphyne, and ENa is the total energy
of an isolated Na atom in vacuum. The Na binding energies for the
triangle and hexagon sites were calculated to be 2.46 and 1.78 eV,
respectively, which indicates that Na energy prefers to bind to a
triangle site than to a hexagon site.

of the (a) hexagons and (b) triangles. The gray-colored and yellow-colored
dots represent the carbon atoms and sodium atoms, respectively. The

accumulation and depletion between the graphyne and Na atom, respectively.

sheet. Gray and yellow lines indicate the positions of the graphyne
sheet and adsorbed Na atoms, respectively.

To investigate the binding mechanism of Na, the charge density
difference was calculated (Figure 1c–f). The charges are transferred from the Na
atom to the graphyne. The in-plane projected charge densities as a
function of z are shown in Figure 1g,h, which are almost the same in both cases.
Our Bader charge analysis38 shows that
0.88 and 0.78 electrons per Na move to the triangle and hexagon of
graphyne, respectively. An attractive feature is that the Na binding
energy on the triangle is larger than that on the hexagon because
the sp-bonded carbon atoms are more reactive than the sp2-bonded carbon atoms. Unlike graphitic materials, the sp-bonded carbon
atoms in graphyne present attractive binding conditions for Na.

The Na atoms are placed over the graphyne sheet by ∼2 Å.
On the graphyne sheet, a Na atom adsorbs on a center of the triangular
site with a binding energy of 2.46 eV/Na (see Figure 1b). The shortest Na–C distance is
2.68 Å and the Na atom is located at a height of 1.7 Å above
the graphyne sheet. Because Na atoms have a large ionic radius, the
binding length of Na atoms is farther than when lithium is adsorbed.
The composites of the Na-dispersed graphynes shown in Figure 1 are C6Na0.125. The Na binding energy on a graphyne sheet (2.46 eV) is greater
than the cohesive energy of bulk Na (1.10 eV). We, therefore, expect
that the Na atoms can be dispersed on graphynes without segregation
of the Na atoms.

We studied the optimized geometries of Na-dispersed
graphynes as
the concentration of Na varies (Figure 2a–d). We considered the case where only one
side of the sodium is adsorbed to figure out the tendency of Na adsorption
on graphyne because our final goal was to investigate the possibility
of multilayer graphyne as an SIB. From the case of one Na atom attached,
we found that the most favorable adsorption site of Na is the triangles.
When the Na concentration was low, at x = 0.250 (Figure 2a), the triangle
site was only partially filled by Na atoms. Near the concentration
of x = 0.875 (Figure 2b), the hexagon site starts to be filled. When the
concentration was x = 1.500 (Figure 2c), all of the triangle and hexagon sites
were filled with one Na atom. Na atoms migrate from the hexagon site
to the triangle site as Na atoms are consecutively added. Unlike lithium
adsorption on graphyne, where the maximum concentration of Li is C6Li3,24 the maximum concentration
for Na adsorption is C6Na2, where all triangle
sites are filled with 2 Na atoms (Figure 2d). Figure 2e shows the calculated binding energy of Na atoms on
single-layered 2 × 2 graphyne as a function of the Na concentration x. According to the binding energy, single-layer graphyne
has the potential for attaching more Na atoms than its concentration x > 2. However, we cut our maximum concentration as x = 2 for single-layer graphyne. Because the Na concentration
is larger than 2, the Na atoms form a second layer structure, which
can cause large volume expansion. It is an inconsistent structure
for application of multilayer graphyne battery anode, which is our
ultimate goal.

different concentrations of Na: (a) x = 0.250, (b) x = 0.875, (c) x = 1.500, and (d) x = 2.000 from C6Nax. (e) Calculated binding energy as a function of the concentration
of Na atoms.

To use realistic anode
materials, now we carried out calculations
on Na intercalation to multilayer graphyne. Figure 3a shows the schematic illustration of SIBs
with the multilayer graphyne as an electrode. We then investigated
the stability of Na dispersion on multilayer graphynes. We only consider
the cases where the Na binding energy of multilayer graphyne is larger
than (or very close to) the cohesive energy of bulk Na. This indicates
that Na-dispersed graphynes for a given x is energetically
more stable than the segregated phase between bulk Na and graphynes.
For the propose of calculation, the open circuit voltage (Vocv) is defined as a function of x 1  where e is the elementary
charge and ENabulk is the total energy per Na in a body-centered
cubic Na (eq 1), which
meets the criterion for the voltage for the SIB anodes. The negative
values of the voltage mean that the segregation between bulk Na and
graphynes is energy favorable.

graphyne. (a) The schematic

Na metal, where graphyne and Na metal represent the anode and cathode,
respectively. Atomic structures for Na-dispersed AA-stacking multilayered

(b) top view, (c) side view. The dark yellow dots indicate the height
below the yellow dots. (d) Calculated voltage by Na intercalation
as the concentration of Na atoms varies.

Based on the Na binding structure of single-layer graphyne,
we
first considered AA-stacked multilayer graphyne. Unlike graphite,
which is endothermic for Na intercalation,39 we found that AA-stacked multilayer graphyne is exothermic for Na
intercalation, where the interlayer distance is 3.1 Å. The tendency
of sodium adsorption geometry retained in the result of sodium intercalation
of single-layer graphyne. On AA-stacked multilayer graphyne, the triangle
sites are filled with one or two Na atoms as the concentration of
Na increases up to approximately x = 1.625. At the
higher concentration of x = 1.625, the hexagon sites
begin to be filled with Na atoms. However, at the maximum concentrations,
namely, x = 2.25, all triangle sites are filled with
two Na atoms (Figure 3b,c), corresponding to the gravimetric and volumetric capacities
of C6Na2.25 of 837 mAh g–1 and 1056 mAh cm–3, respectively, much larger than
those of graphite for lithium (372 mAh g–1 and 818
mAh cm–3). The tendency of the occupation of Na
atoms is consistent with that on single-layer graphyne. The layer–layer
distance is increased up to 4.1 Å by Na intercalation and up
to three Na atoms are intercalated at a triangle site with different
heights with respect to the graphyne plane. In contrast, the maximum
concentration of Na on monolayer graphyne is C6Na1.5,41 which is lower than that of multilayer
graphyne. These results show that the Na capacity of multilayer graphyne
could be higher than that of a monolayer one. We found that the interlayer
distance in Na-intercalated graphynes has a weak dependence on the
concentration x. The voltage by Na intercalation
on multilayer graphynes slightly increases compared with that on single-layer
graphynes. The voltage by Na insertion was calculated as the Na concentration
increases (Figure 3d). Importantly, the voltage and capacity of AA-stacked multilayer
graphyne meet the criteria for the anode. The magnitude of the voltage
of AA-stacked multilayer graphyne becomes twice as high as that in
single-layer graphyne because a Na atom interacts with both sides
of graphyne, whereas the Na atom interacts with one side of single-layer
graphyne.

We also considered AB-stacked multilayer graphyne
for Na intercalation.
Like AA-stacked multilayer graphyne, triangle sites begin to be filled
with Na atoms and then hexagon sites are filled with Na atoms at higher
concentrations of Na (Figure 4a–f). At the maximum concentration, x = 1.875, one or two Na atoms occupy triangle sites and the interlayer
distance is increased. The tendency of Na intercalation is similar
to that in AA-stacked graphyne. The calculated maximum gravimetric
and volumetric capacities of AB-stacked graphyne reach 697.5 mAh g–1 and 920 mAh cm–3, respectively,
larger than those of graphite for lithium. Since the calculated voltage
and capacity of AA- and AB-staked graphynes (Figure 4g) meet the requirements for the anode,
multilayer graphyne can be used for the SIB anodes. Moreover, the
AA-stacked graphyne is metallic and the AB-staked graphyne is semiconducting
with a small gap of 0.19 eV,40 which is
also an advantage when using anode materials.

multilayer graphyne. Atomic structures

of Na, (a) x = 0.500, (b) x = 1.000,
(c) x = 1.500, (d) x = 1.625, (e) x = 1.875, and (f) x = 1.875 with side
view. (g) Calculated voltage by Na intercalation as the concentration
of Na atoms varies.

In addition to the insertion
capacity, the kinetics of Na ions
in graphyne multilayer structures is one of the key factors for the
anode. As anode materials, van der Waals compounds such as graphite
have major advantages such as their high Li diffusivity, small volume
change by Li intercalation, and high durability by good reversibility
of Li and scalability because of their layered structures. Similar
to graphite-based LIBs, multilayer graphynes can form an SIB anode.
According to a recent study,41 Na atom
can diffuse readily in the in-plane direction as well as in the out-of-plane
direction due to a large hole of the triangle site, whereas Na atoms
can diffuse only in the in-plane direction in graphene. This result
confirms that SIB based on a graphyne anode can have higher power
than LIB based on a graphene anode. Moreover, the structural stability
of graphynes would be high in the process of lithium intercalation/deintercalation
because of their layered structures like graphite, leading to no reconstruction
of graphyne during charge and discharge of Na. Since there is a big
activation barrier between the sp–sp2 carbon structure
and the full sp2 carbon structure, we believe that the
structure of graphyne may remain unchanged during a continuous cycle
of charge and discharge.

We discussed the noticeable properties
of multilayer graphynes
as a promising SIB anode material. The bond of Na atoms energetically
prefers the sp-bonded carbon atom of graphyne to the sp2-bonded carbon atom. This is ascribed to the fact that the sp-bonded
carbon atoms are more reactive to Na than the sp2-bonded
carbon atoms. These graphyne-based SIBs have a high Na gravimetric
density. For this reason, multilayer graphynes may have a larger Na
capacity than graphite, which is made up of only sp2-bonded
carbon atoms. Therefore, we believe that sp–sp2 hybrid
carbon sheets such as graphdiyne can also be used for the SIB anodes.

4 Conclusions
We investigated the applicability of multilayer
graphynes for Na-ion
battery (SIB) anodes using first-principles density-functional theory.
Our investigation highlights that multilayer graphynes are promising
high-capacity SIB anode materials. (1) The calculated voltages by
Na intercalation were found to be suitable for the anodes. (2) The
gravimetric and volumetric Na capacity of multilayer graphynes can
reach ∼837 mAh g–1 and ∼1056 mAh cm–3, much larger than those of graphite anode for lithium-ion
batteries (372 mAh g–1 and ∼800 mAh cm–3, respectively). (3) Moreover, because of their layered
structure with high porosity, Na would be highly diffusive in the
in-plane as well as the out-of-plane directions in multilayer graphyne,
leading to a high-power battery. These findings are generated from
the geometric feature of multilayer graphynes because of their sp–sp2 hybrid carbon sheets and layered structures. Therefore, we
propose that multilayer sp–sp2 carbon sheets can
be utilized as promising candidates for Na-ion battery anodes.
