There is a large amount of Camellia oleifera shells generated as a waste product
from industrial processes. Therefore, the high-value utilization of C. oleifera shells is a hotspot of current research.
The thermal characteristics and kinetics of waste Camellia shells
(WCOSs) were analyzed by thermogravimetry with gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (TG–GC/MS). The thermal behavior of WCOSs was
studied at 10, 20, 40, and 60 °C/min, and the distributed activation
energy model (DAEM) was used to research the kinetics and activation
energies. The activation energies of WCOSs based on the DAEM ranged
from 68.64 to 244.49 kJ/mol, corresponding to the conversion rate
from 0.10 to 0.90. The correlation coefficient (R2) shows the best fit, and it ranged from 0.921 to 0.994.
Pyrolysis products at four key temperature points (228, 296, 492,
and 698 °C) were studied via GC/MS. Many compounds were detected
at the different temperatures. With the increase of temperature, furans,
benzene, and long-chain alkanes were produced successively. This data
will help to expand the utilization of WCOSs.

1 Introduction
With the growing population
and the developing economy, a large consumption of fossil fuels (coal,
petroleum, and natural gas) has caused energy crisis and environmental
problems.1 The release of large amounts
of CO2 into the atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect
and climate change. In addition, combustion products like NOX and SO2 cause air pollution, which
damages human health.2 Renewable and environmentally
friendly technologies have been developed for energy products, storage,
and utilization. Among various renewable energy technologies, the
utilization of biomass energy is a popular research topic.3 Thermochemical conversion technology of biomass
is an effective method for biomass utilization. By this method, biomass
can be converted into biochar, biogas, and biooil under limited or
no oxygen, which can be used in the energy and chemical industries.1,4−6

Camellia oleifera is an important
woody oil crop and is widely planted in South China, with more than
12 million acres in production.7 In recent
years, the planting area of C. oleifera gradually increased because of the varieties of the functional components
of the Camellia oil, such as vitamin E, squalene,
phytosterols, and flavonoids.8 However,
its processing produces a large amount of waste C.
oleifera shells (WCOSs). Approximately, 0.54 tons
of WCOSs are produced for each ton of processed C.
oleifera.8 Burning and
landfill are the traditional disposal methods for WOCSs, but they
cause serious pollution to the environment. In the past decade, there
have been various studies on the comprehensive utilization of WCOSs.10−13 These
studies focused on the extraction and the property analysis of active
substances, as well as the preparation and the property analysis of
the chemicals from WCOSs.10−13 Recently, carbon materials derived
from WCOSs have been produced via different technology, such as carbon
microspheres with a controllable porous structure and functionalized
aromatic carbon microspheres.14,15 These studies have broadened
the utilization scope of WCOSs. However, these applications cannot
consume many WCOSs at present. As a type of waste, WCOSs contain 22.6%
hemicellulose, 17.8% cellulose, and 22.6% lignin and can be converted
into biomass energy.9,16 Therefore, it is of great importance
to analyze the pyrolysis characteristics of WCOSs.

Thermogravimetry
(TG) is used to analyze the thermodynamic parameters of material decomposition
under inert gases via mass change. Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
(FTIR) and mass spectrometry (MS) are used to analyze the pyrolysis
products via coupling with TG.17,18 Additionally, pyrolysis–gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry is used to examine the volatile
components of pyrolysis at a specific temperature.19 These methods quantitatively and qualitatively analyze
the escaping gas during pyrolysis. However, identifying the compounds
derived from the pyrolysis products is difficult because of numerous
overlapping signals, which are produced by a wide range of low-molecular-weight
compounds. The separation of released products is absent for TG–FTIR
and TG–MS systems.20

Thermogravimetry
with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TG–GC/MS)
is an advanced technology for identifying volatile gases of pyrolyzed
samples at a certain pyrolysis of the specific condition.20−23 During
TG–GC/MS experiments, TG is employed to analyze the mass change,
and GC/MS is used to separate and identify the components of the released
gases from the pyrolyzed samples via TG devices at specific temperature
conditions. Thus, the results of TG–GC/MS are more accurate
than those of TG–FTIR and TG–MS for the reaction of
the pyrolysis products at a certain time. Fan et al.20 researched the pyrolysis products from walnut shells at
different temperatures and analyzed the components of the pyrolyzed
samples at different conditions. With the increasing pyrolysis temperature,
furan, furfural, benzene, and long-chain alkanes were successively
identified in different GC–MS experimental results. Fedelich21 confirmed that TG–GC/MS can be used to
investigate the pyrolytic process by the quantification of low-content
styrene–butadiene rubber in natural rubber. Striu̅gas
et al.22 found that products of straw with
absorbed glycerol thermal degradation during pyrolysis were gases,
acrolein, and glycerol at low temperatures. Qin et al.23 investigated the thermal degradation of medical
plastic waste by in situ FTIR, TG–MS, and TG–GC/MS coupled
analyses, which improved the reliability of the results. Thus, it
is feasible to study the pyrolysis products and characteristics of
WCOSs using TG–GC/MS. There are no known reports dealing with
the pyrolysis products and the characteristics of WCOSs by TG–GC/MS.

The kinetic models are used to study the complex pyrolysis kinetics.24 In numerous models, the distributed activation
energy model (DAEM) is an effective method for analyzing pyrolysis
kinetics of biomass. In the DAEM, the reaction process is assumed
to be many independent reactions with different activation energies.25

In this study, the pyrolysis behaviors
and kinetics were researched with the DAEM by a TG experiment at different
heating rates. The 20 °C/min heating rate was chosen during the
TG–GC/MS experiment. The identification and regularity analysis
of escaped products were carried out by GC/MS at important temperature
points.

2 Results and
Discussion
2.1 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
The pyrolysis characteristics and behavior of WCOSs
were investigated using TG and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG). Figure 1 shows the TG and
DTG curves with different heating rates ranging from 10 to 60 °C.
Thermogravimetric curves show the mass change with progressing temperatures,
and DTG curves present the mass loss rate during the pyrolysis of
WCOSs. As shown in Figure 1, the first peak can be seen at approximately 150 °C.
This is due to WCOSs containing both extractive components (tea saponin,
tannin, active polysaccharide, etc.) and water, which result in a
low volatilization temperature.26 In addition,
the front shoulder observed a weak peak because of tea saponin and
tannin contents ranging from 15 to 30%.26 The main weight loss occurred in the pyrolysis temperature range
of 200–450 °C, and this was attributed to the thermal
degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose, and partial lignin.27,28

Figure 1 TG (a) and DTG (b) curve
of pyrolysis from Camellia tea shells at different
heating rates.

The pyrolysis parameters of WCOSs are given in Table 1. As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, the peak temperatures increased from 283
to 355 °C when the heating rate was increased from 10 to 60 °C/min.
Additionally, the maximum loss rate increased from 4.53 to 21.81%
min–1 when the heating rate was increased from 10
to 60 °C/min. In summary, the initial temperature, final temperature,
and temperature for the maximum weight loss rate increased when the
heating rate was increased. The peak shift due to the increase in
the heating rate attributes to the increased thermal lag.27,28 The heating rate had no noticeable effect on the residual mass
(Figure 2).

2.2 Kinetic Results by the DAEM
Method
The DAEM method is often used to research the kinetic
parameters of the pyrolysis process of biomass, and this type of isoconversional
method is the most reliable method for the calculation of the kinetic
parameters.29,30 In this work, four different
heating rates of 10, 20, 40, and 60 °C/min were used in the DAEM
method. For each heating rate, the Arrhenius plot of  under selected values of the conversion rate (0.10–0.90)
was established and is shown in Figure 1 according to eq 3. The plot of  was a straight line at each heating rate, and activation
energy (E) and the correlation coefficient (R2) were calculated from the slope and intercept
according to linear regression (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Activation energy and correlation factor from the DAEM
for WCOSs.

The results showed that the activation energy
ranged from 68.64 to 244.49 kJ/mol, which corresponded to the conversion
rate ranging from 0.10 to 0.90. Compared with other biomass (e.g.,
walnut shells), the activation energy of WCOSs was low at a low conversion
rate (0.10–0.20).9 This may be due
to WCOSs containing more extractive components.26 When the conversion rate was 0.75–0.90, the activation
energy increased sharply from 125.13 to 244.99 kJ/mol. The activation
energy variation trend was attributed to various functional groups
in the macromolecular structure. Their chemical bonds break under
different activation energies in the various pyrolysis temperatures.29 The correlation coefficient for all lines at
various conversions was greater than 0.90, and the values ranged from
0.921 to 0.994, which showed the best fit.

2.3 GC/MS Series Analysis
During the
pyrolysis process, the products were pyrolyzed continually during
the TG experiment. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry can
only analyze the pyrolysis products from a given time point because
of the long analysis period for GC/MS. According to the pyrolysis
characteristics, temperature at mass losses of 10% (228 °C),
the maximum mass loss rate (296 °C), mass losses of 90% (492
°C), and mass losses of 98% (698 °C) were analyzed to estimate
the pyrolysis products. At 228 °C, the extractive components,
partial cellulose, and partial hemicellulose were pyrolyzed. At 296
°C,
the pyrolysis rate of the samples was the fastest, and various products
were produced. At 492 °C, the main pyrolysis reaction tends to
end and residual lignin was pyrolyzed continuously. At 698 °C,
the pyrolysis reaction was over except for a few secondary reactions.

Figure 4 and Table 2 exhibit both the
GC/MS fingerprint and the produced components of WCOSs at different
selected pyrolysis temperature points. A matching degree higher than
75% was accepted in the detected products, excluding the last four
products in Table 2. During testing, the last four products had a matching degree of
60–65%. The pyrolysis fingerprint of the WCOSs was obviously
different from that of the previously studied walnut shells, and the
products were simpler.20 The reason may
be that the lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose in WCOSs and walnut
shells have different effects on each other during the pyrolysis process.31

products evolving from WCOSs at different temperatures.

Table 1 shows that the pyrolysis products of WCOSs were rich
and different in composition at different temperatures. When the temperature
increased, the product composition became more diverse. The reason
is that the pyrolysis of lignin and the occurrence of secondary reactions
produced complex products.32 Additionally,
any former parts of pyrolysis products that were not completely discharged
from the connecting pipe could still be observed in a later detection.

In the initial stage of pyrolysis (228 °C), the results of
GC/MS indicated that the main pyrolysis products of WCOSs were low-carbon
(C ≤ 5) compounds, including 2-butene, acetic acid methyl ester,
2-methylfuran, and furfural. The results showed that the unstable
branched chain of hemicellulose and cellulose from WCOSs broke. Furfural
was detected to originate from the pyrolyzed cellulose of WCOSs.32,33 The pyrolysis temperature of cellulose and hemicellulose was low,
and their initial pyrolysis temperature was generally considered to
be below 200 °C. Therefore, parts of cellulose, hemicellulose,
and the extractive components were pyrolyzed at 228 °C. The main
pyrolysis products at this stage were CO2, CO, and H2. In addition, the products showed that nitrogen- and sulfur-containing
compounds in WCOSs were pyrolyzed at a lower temperature.

At
296 °C, the maximum mass loss rate of WCOSs reached 8.32% min–1, and many products from the pyrolyzed WCOSs were
detected, including 2-methylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran, furfural, and
4-cyclopentene-1,3-dione. Compared with the pyrolysis products for
the maximum mass loss rate of walnut shells, the pyrolysis products
of WCOSs were simple. No benzene-containing compounds were detected
at this temperature point, indicating that only a small amount of
unstable carboxyl and carbonyl chains in lignin side chains was broken.

At 492 °C, the mass loss of WCOSs was reduced by 90%. Table 2 shows that the pyrolysis
products were complex and diverse, including 2-methylfuran, furfural,
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, 1,3-dimethylbenzene, and o-xylene. The product contained benzene ring compounds because of
the pyrolyzed lignin, and furan compounds in the product were due
to residues from previous pyrolysis products in the pipelines.

At 698 °C, the pyrolysis of WCOSs was completed. The product
contained many benzene compounds because the aromatic ring of lignin
had side chain breaking, condensation, etc. In addition, long-chain
alkanes were detected in the products. The aliphatic long-chain in
lignin continued to break, and the aromatic properties of biochar
increased.

3 Conclusions
An increase in the pyrolysis peak temperatures of WCOSs was observed
ranging from 283 to 355 °C, corresponding to the heating rate
ranging from 10 to 60 °C/min. The activation energies based on
the DAEM ranged from 68.64 to 244.49 kJ/mol, corresponding to the
conversion rate from 0.10 to 0.90. The pyrolysis products at four
key temperature points (228, 296, 492, and 698 °C) were studied
via GC/MS. Approximately 20 different substances were detected at
the different temperatures. Furans, benzene, and long-chain alkanes
were produced successively when the pyrolysis temperatures were increased.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
WCOSs
were collected from Yunnan Province, China. The WCOSs were washed
with deionized water and then dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The dried
WCOSs were shredded to shorter than 0.075 mm (approximately 200 mesh)
for the TG–GC/MS test. The proximate analyses for the volatile,
fixed carbon, and ash of WCOSs were 72.68, 23.95, and 3.37%, respectively.
The ultimate analyses for the chemicals C, H, N, S, and O were 44.85,
5.01, 0.48, 0.21, and 46.08%, respectively. The O content was calculated
with a dry ash-free base by difference.

4.2 TG Experiment and Pyrolysis Kinetics
Thermogravimetric analysis was used to study the pyrolysis characteristics
of WCOSs. The kinetic parameters of pyrolysis provide information
that helps to design and optimize the thermal-chemical system.34 In this paper, the DAEM was selected to estimate
the kinetics of WCOSs and has been proved to be a useful and reliable
model during biomass pyrolysis.35,36

During the biomass
pyrolysis, the DAEM assumed that the reaction is an independent parallel
first-order reaction, and each reaction has its own activation energy,
which is continuously distributed.20,29,30 The DAEM was represented as follows in eq 1 1  where V is the volatile content at temperature T (g), V* is the effective volatile content of the sample (g), k0 is the pre-exponential factor (m/s), β
is the heating rate (K/min), T is the absolute temperature
(K), E is the activation energy (kJ/mol), and R represent the universal gas content (8.314 J/(mol·K)),
and f(E) is the distribution curve
of the activation energy representing the difference in the activation
energies (units), calculated as shown in eq 2 2  A simple integral model
for estimating the kinetic parameters based on the DAEM was presented
by Miura and is expressed as shown in eq 3 3  where the Arrhenius plot of  is a straight line whose slope and intercept are
calculated as E and k0, respectively.

The pyrolysis of WCOSs was studied using a
TG (SETSYS Evo; SETARAM, Caluire, France), with temperatures starting
from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10, 20,
40, and 60 °C/min under 50 mL/min of the high purity helium.
For each experiment, 20 mg of the sample was used.

4.3 TG–GC/MS Experiment
A GC/MS system (ISQ, LT; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled
with a TG (SETSYS Evo; SETARAM, Caluire, France) was used to carry
out the TG–GC/MS experiment. The evolved gas was collected
via an Automation Autoinjector system (TC3, ITEM; SETARAM, Caluire,
France), and the transmission line was maintained at 280 °C to
prevent the condensation of the evolved gas. A heating rate of 20
°C/min was chosen for the TG–GC/MS experiment. Data were
collected at four temperature points, namely 228, 296, 492, and 698 °C
according to the mass losses of 10%, the maximum mass loss rate, mass
losses of 90%, and mass losses of 98%, respectively. When the WCOSs
were pyrolyzed by TG at the specific temperatures, the evolved gas
was then separated through GC and detected in the MS system. A TraceGOLD
TG-5MS GC Column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was chosen
with a 30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25 μm film
thickness. The oven temperature was held at 40 °C for 1 min and
then increased from 40 to 100 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C/min.
It was then maintained for 2 min, increased from 100 to 150 °C
at a rate of 5 °C/min and maintained for 1 min, then increased
again from 150 to 230 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min, and finally
it was increased from 230 to 280 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min.
High purity helium gas (99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a
flow rate of 1.3 mL/min. The electron impact mass spectra were obtained
with 70 eV of ionizing energy, and the scanning range was from 50
to 600 m/z with a frequency of 4
scans/s. The ion source temperature was held at 280 °C. Every
injection was collected from the repeated TG experiments at the same
set temperature because of a lack of time at different set temperatures
for the GC/MS analysis during a single TG experiment. MS E.02.01.1177
Chemstation system software was used to identify the separated compound
of MS with NIST 11 library data.23
