Here we demonstrate
theranostic immune checkpoint inhibitor nanocomposites
(ICI NC) having an improved tumor targeting ability in pulmonary metastatic
colon cancer model. Atezolizumab, a PD-L1 antibody, was conjugated
with methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MePEG) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) via
cathepsin-B-sensitive peptide as a linkage (named as ICI nanocomposites,
ICI NC). This ICI NC is delivered to tumor sites enriched with tumor-specific
enzymes such as cathepsin B, whereas undesired ICI exposure to normal
tissue is avoided. When ICI NC were incubated with cathepsin B, Ce6
was released from ICI NC with increased fluorescence intensity in
cathepsin B dose-dependent manner, which was by degradation of the
peptide and then liberated Ce6 was activated in the aqueous solution.
In animal pulmonary metastasis model using CT26 cells, ICI NC showed
superior tumor targetability, i.e., fluorescence intensity was significantly
strong in the mouse lung having metastatic tumor. On the contrary,
cathepsin-B-deficient carriers such as atezolizumab-Ce6 conjugates
or atezolizumab-Ce6/MePEG conjugates showed strong fluorescence intensity
in the liver as well as lung. Our proposed ICI NC may be used for
theranostic cancer therapy with superior tumor specificity of releasing
ICI and Ce6 into tumor microenvironment, thereby showing an efficient
inhibitory effect on pulmonary metastasis of CT26 cells.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Tumors frequently utilize immune checkpoints, a key regulator of
the immune system, expressed on themselves and T-cells to disable
the immune system killing them.1,2 Immune system to attack
tumor can be restored by blocking these checkpoints.1,2 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been extensively investigated
in the recent decade since the inhibition of immune checkpoint expression
in immune cells or cancer cells is believed to be a more safe and
efficient therapeutic regimen for cancer patients than conventional
therapy.3−9 Anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 monoclonal antibody,
named as Ipilimumab (Yervoy), was inceptively approved in the US for
the first- or second-line treatment option for patients with malignant
melanoma.10 CTLA4, programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are currently
approved for clinical use in treating cancer patients. Upregulation
of PD-L1 expression on the tumor cell surface disables T cell activity
of ‘cancer attack’ through binding with PD-1 on an immune
cell surface.11 Therefore, antibodies that
bind to either PD-1 of the T cell surface or PD-L1 on the tumor cell
surface can elevate antitumor activity of T-cells.12 Fujimoto et al. reported that nivolumab has reasonable
efficacy against patients of metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).13 Clinical trials using PD-1 and/or
PD-L1 inhibitors reported impressive antitumor activity in patients
of breast cancer.14 Furthermore, blocking
of PD-L1-induced durable tumor regression and prolonged stabilization
of disease in cancer patients, including nonsmall-cell lung cancer,
melanoma, and renal cell cancer.15

In spite of the successful approach of using ICIs in cancer treatment,
various unwanted immune-related adverse events have been reported
resulting from the blockade of checkpoints in most of the organs of
the human body.13,16−20 In the clinical use of a PD-1 inhibitor such as nivolumab,
pneumonitis is a common immune-related adverse effect, which restricts
the clinical use of PD-1 inhibitor for patients of NSCLC.13 Furthermore, it was reported that immune-related
adverse events such as pancreatitis brought severe side effects such
as acral vascular necrosis, hypophysitis, and endocrine dysfunction
in the clinical use of ICI.16−20 Researchers are therefore developing novel ICIs to reduce immune-related
adverse effects as well as to improve antitumor efficacy for cancer
patients. Polymer-based drug carriers such as polymer conjugates,
nanoparticles, and polymeric micelles have been spotlighted in the
targeted drug delivery of bioactive molecules and anticancer drugs.21−23 They have unique features such as small hydrodynamic radius, surface
functionality for chemical modification, long-lasting half-lives in
the human blood circulation system, and active/passive transport into
desirable organs/tissues.21−25 For example, Lim et al. reported that poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated
anticancer agents via tumor-specific peptide can be specifically delivered
to tumor cells by matrix metalloproteases and inhibited viability
of cancer cells.24 Furthermore, transferrin-conjugated
polysaccharides deliver anticancer drug to 9L glioma cells in a specific
manner.25 Surface-modified polymer nanoparticles
efficiently deliver anticancer agents to liver cancer cells with superior
anticancer effects and reduced intrinsic cytotoxicity against normal
cells.26 Song et al. reported that plasmid
DNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle delivered PD-L1 trap to cancer cells
and oxliplatin/PD-L1 trap combination efficiently inhibited the growth
of tumor with reduced immune-related adverse effects.27 Choo et al. reported that a combination of exosome-mimetic
nanovesicles and PD-L1 inhibitors efficiently suppressed tumor growth
and potentiated antitumor efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor therapy.28 Wang et al. reported that hyaluronidase (HAases)
with pH-responsive Dextran for delivering and releasing of HAases
in an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) enhanced the therapeutic
effect of photodynamic and PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy.29 Therefore, if we can give tumor targetability
and capability of monitoring their work inside the body to ICIs, which
can be the best option for successful treatment.

Herein, we
demonstrated novel ICI nanocomposites (ICI NC) to be
delivered into tumor sites and release ICIs at the sites with fluorescent
signal for enhanced immunotherapy of pulmonary metastasis of colon
cancer cells (Figure 1). Atezolizumab, a potent PD-L1 inhibitor, was conjugated with methoxy
poly(ethylene glycol) (MePEG) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) via cathepsin-B-specific
peptide (glycylphenylalanyl-leucylglycine tetrapeptide (Gly-Phe-Leu-Gly,
GFLG)) for tumor-specific delivery of atezolizumab. Ce6 produces the
fluorescent signal. Since metastatic tumor cells frequently secrete
extracellular enzymes such as cathepsin B, cathepsin-B-specific peptide
enables vehicles to release and deliver the drug inside to metastatic
cancer cells.30 Anticancer activity of
the ICI NC was then investigated using pulmonary metastasis of colon
cancer cells.

nanocomposites
(ICI NC) can deliver ICI specifically into the tumor microenvironment
(TME).

2 Results and Discussion
In spite of superior anticancer activity, major drawbacks of ICIs
such as CTLA4, PD-1, and PD-L1 are deficiency of tumor specificity,
and thus induce immune-related life-threatening adverse effects such
as inflammation reaction in all organs.16,17 In clinical
trials, atezolizumab showed a reasonable antitumor activity against
metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic NSCLC, and advanced urothelial
carcinomas.31−33 However, its immune-related adverse effect also was
problematic in clinical trials, i.e., grade 3–4 adverse events
of atezolizumab-treated group were higher than 30%.33 From these reasons, tumor specificity of ICI needs to be
improved and immune reactions should be reduced in normal organs by
the development of novel types of ICI derivatives. Furthermore, in
vivo distribution of ICI also needs to be investigated to clarify
the immunological reaction of ICI in the human body.

For this
purpose, we synthesized ICI NC to assign a tumor-favorable
property to ICI. MePEG and Ce6 were conjugated using a cathepsin-B-sensitive
peptide linker, as shown in Figure 2. MePEG was introduced in ICI NC due to the stealth
properties of PEG.34 Since PEG is a neutral,
flexible, and hydrophilic material, it can form a surface barrier
to reduce the adhesion of opsonins and to enhance blood circulation
by avoiding an attack of phagocytic cells. Stealth properties of PEG
of the nanocarriers give great chances to target TME.35 Furthermore, Ce6, a potent photosensitizer, enables nanocarriers
to diagnose abnormal status of TME.30 The
GFLG tetrapeptide is a widely used linker peptide for drug delivery
to cancer, which is sensitive to the lysosomal enzyme, cathepsin B.36,37 The amide bond between F and L of the peptide is the cleavage sites.
Cathepsin B is an emerging therapeutic target protein enriched in
TME as well as involved in tumorigenesis and metastasis.38,39

scheme and 1H NMR spectra of MePEG-GFLG conjugates
(a), Ce6–GFLG conjugates (b), and ICI nanocomposites (c).

Figure 2a shows
the synthesis scheme of MePEG–GFLG peptide conjugates. Ethylene
protons of PEG were confirmed at 3.6 ppm and specific peaks of GFLG
peptide was confirmed at 1.0–7.4 ppm, as shown in Figure 2a, indicating that
MePEG–GFLG peptide conjugates were successfully synthesized. Figure 2b shows the synthesis
of Ce6–GFLG peptide conjugates. Specific peaks of Ce6 and GFLG
peptide were confirmed at 0.8–8.4 ppm, as shown in Figure 2b. The yield of MePEG–GFLG
and Ce6–GFLG conjugates was approximately 95 and 96% (w/w),
respectively. These were attached to atezolizumab, a PD-L1 inhibitor,
as shown in Figure 2c. The molar ratio of MePEG–GFLG conjugates/Ce6–GFLG
conjugates/atezolizumab was 4:4:1. As shown in Figure 2c, specific peaks of atezolizumab were confirmed
between 1.8 and 5.4 ppm. 1H NMR spectra of ICI NC confirmed
that specific peaks of MePEG, GFLG peptide, and Ce6 were assigned
at 3.4–3.6, 0.6–0.8 ppm/1.7 ppm/7.1–7.4, and
1.4–1.6 ppm, respectively, indicating that ICI NC were successively
synthesized. To estimate chemical structures of PEG–GFLG, Ce6–GFLG
conjugates, ICI, and ICI NC, heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation
(HMQC) map using 13C NMR spectra and 1H NMR
spectra was performed. As shown in Figure S1, the peak assignments and shifts were confirmed as follows: C1,
20–26 ppm; C2, 23 ppm; and C3 and C4, 130–135 ppm. HMQC
of Ce6–GFLG is shown in Figure S2; C1, 21–23 ppm; C2, 25 ppm; C3 and C4, 125–140 ppm;
and C6, 120–125 ppm. Figure S3 shows
HMQC of ICI (Figure S3a) and ICIC nanocomposites
(Figure S3b). Specific peaks of ICI were
confirmed at 40–100 ppm in 13C and co-related HMQC
map. Furthermore, HMQC map of ICI NC also showed the specific peaks
of ICI and PEG. To fabricate nanoparticles, ICI NC were reconstituted
in an aqueous solution. ICI NC have spherical shape (Figure 3a) and have a small diameter
less than 100 nm (Figure 3b), indicating that ICI NC form self-aggregates in aqueous
solution as nanoscale vehicles.

Figure 3 Morphology (a) and particle size distribution
(b) of ICI NC. Particle
size in the box was average particle sizes ± s.d. from six measurements.

To monitor cathepsin B specificity, ICI NC were
incubated with
cathepsin B, as shown in Figure 4. Fluorescence intensity of ICI NC was gradually increased
according to the dose of cathepsin B, while ICI NC showed strongest
fluorescence intensity at dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) solution (50%,
(v/v)). These results indicated that the fluorescent dye, Ce6, was
liberated from nanocomposites by the degradation of GFLG peptide and
the fluorescence property was activated while Ce6 in the nanocomposites
was stayed in the ground state. It was reported that Ce6 in the backbone
of nanoparticles stays in the ground state with a weak fluorescence
intensity.30 As Lee et al. showed that
the fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin-incorporated nanoparticles
increased with incubation with cathepsin B,40 where the increased fluorescence intensity was due to the cathepsin-B-mediated
cleavage of GFLG peptide and then liberation of doxorubicin from nanoparticles,
Ce6 was activated and the fluorescence intensity was significantly
increased when it was liberated from nanoparticles by degradation
of the disulfide bond. Our results confirm the increase of fluorescence
intensity with Ce6 liberation from the ICI NC by the treatment of
cathepsin B. With Ce6 liberation, atezolizumab is also liberated from
the nanocomposites in the TME because cathepsin B is an extracellular
enzyme of tumor and closely involved in invasion and metastasis of
cancer cells. Linkage of cathepsin-B-sensitive peptide enables nanocarriers
to be targeted to metastatic cancer cells specifically. Therefore,
our constructed ICI NC may have antitumor activity against metastatic
tumor.

Figure 4 Fluorescence emission spectra and images of ICI nanocomposites
in the presence of cathepsin B at different concentrations.

To investigate targetability and antitumor activity
of ICI NC against
tumor metastasis, a pulmonary metastasis model of CT26 colon carcinoma
cells was prepared using BALb/C mouse. Figure 5 shows the biodistribution and antitumor
activity of ICI NC injected into the mouse model. The delivery capacity
of atezolizumab-Ce6 conjugates (Figure 5a), atezolizumab-Ce6/MePEG conjugates (Figure 5b), and ICI nanocomposites
(Figure 5c) was compared.
All vehicles showed delivery capacity to mouse lung with tumor metastasis.
However, GFLG-deficient vehicles such as atezolizumab-Ce6 (Figure 5a) and atezolizumab-Ce6/MePEG
conjugates (Figure 5b) showed a strong fluorescence intensity also in the liver. Atezolizumab-Ce6
also showed increased fluorescence intensity in the brain tissues.
Importantly, ICI NC (Figure 5c) showed strongest fluorescence intensity in mouse lung with
tumor metastasis, whereas the fluorescence intensity was relatively
decreased at other organs.

(Scale bar = 2 cm).

These results indicated
that our proposed ICI NC have specificity
to metastatic tumor cells, while atezolizumab-Ce6 and atezolizumab-Ce6/MePEG
conjugates have limited specificity to metastatic tumor. The antitumor
activity of ICI NC was then investigated (Figure 6). As expected, improved tumor targetability
of ICI NC enhanced the therapeutic activity of ICI, and ICI NC efficiently
inhibited metastasis of CT26 cells, i.e., the lung weight of ICI NC
treated mice group was approximately 30% of the control group (Control
> ICI > ICI NC, *p < 0.0001, one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA)).

* p < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA.

Taken all together, ICI NC have superior targetability to metastasis
tumor and efficiently inhibited metastasis of tumor cells. Released
Ce6 with ICIs at the sites showed strong fluorescent signal to be
monitored. Therefore, our experimental model of ICI NC has superior
antitumor activity and targetability against metastatic tumor, proposing
a novel ICI NC for the next onco-immuno-therpeutics to modulate TME
and kill metastatic cancer.

3 Conclusions
We demonstrated
ICI NC having improved tumor targetability. MePEG
and Ce6 were conjugated with atezolizumab using cathepsin-B-sensitive
peptide as a linkage (ICI nanocomposites). They have small sizes as
nanocarriers and showed cathepsin-B-sensitive liberation of Ce6, indicating
that ICI NC can be delivered in a cathepsin-B-sensitive manner in
the TME. In the animal tumor metastasis model using CT26 cells, ICI
NC showed superior targetability with a fluorescent signal monitor
against pulmonary metastasis of CT26 colorectal cells and efficiently
inhibited metastasis of tumor, without sacrificing ICI antibody’s
own activity as well as without worrying about unexpected side effects
at normal tissues.

664 nm). Ce6 itself dissolved in DMSO was used for the standard test.
Ce6 content (wt %) = (Ce6 weight/total weight of conjugates) ×
100.

4.2.5 13C NMR Spectra
The
chemical structure of ICI nanocomposites was confirmed with 13C NMR spectra (500 mHz superconducting Fourier transform (FT)-NMR
spectrometer, Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz NB High Resolution FT NMR;
Varian Inc, Santa Clara, CA).

4.3 Characterization
of PEGylated ICI Nanocomposites
Synthesis of ICI nanocomposites
and each chemical was monitored
with 1H NMR spectra (500 mHz superconducting Fourier transform
(FT)-NMR spectrometer, Varian Unity Inova 500 MHz NB High Resolution
FT NMR; Varian Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Synthesized ICI nanocomposites
were reconstituted in an aqueous solution such as deionized water
or PBS (pH 7.4, 0.01 M) by brief sonication. Particle sizes of ICI
nanocomposites (0.1%, w/w) were measured with Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern,
Worcestershire, U.K.). Morphology of nanocomposites was observed with
a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (H-7600, Hitachi Instruments
Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The nanocomposite solution was placed on the
carbon-film-coated grid for TEM and then dried in room temperature
for 3 h. Nanocomposites were stained negatively with phosphotungstic
acid (0.1%, w/w in deionized water). The observation was carried out
at 80 kV.

Fluorescence emission scan between 500 and 800 nm
(excitation wavelength: 400 nm) was measured with a multifunctional
microplate reader (Infinite M200pro microplate reader, Tecan, Mannedorf,
Switzerland). The same solution was fluorescently observed with Maestro
2 small animal imaging instrument (Cambridge Research and Instrumentation
Inc., Hopkinton, MA). To analyze Ce6 liberation, 5 mg of ICI nanocomposites
was reconstituted in 2.5 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH
7.4, 0.01 M) and then mixed with various concentrations of cathepsin
B. This solution was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and then used
for fluorescence scan.

4.4 Cell Culture
CT26
mouse colorectal
carcinoma cells were obtained from the Korean Cell Line Bank Co. (Seoul
< Korea). Cells were maintained with Roswell Park Memorial Institute
(RPMI)-1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
and 1% (v/v) antibiotics in a 5% CO2 incubator (37 °C).

4.5 In Vivo Pulmonary Metastasis of Colon Cancer
Pulmonary metastasis of CT26 cells were prepared using BALb/C mice
(male, 20 g, 4 weeks old). CT26 cells (1 × 105 cells/0.1 mL)
was intravenously (i.v.) administered via the tail vein. Four mice
were used for each group. Three days later, ICI nanocomposites reconstituted
in PBS were sterilized with a 1.2 μm syringe filter and then
i.v. injected into the mice (Dose: 20 mg/kg). For control treatment,
PBS was injected. The injection volume was 0.2 mL. After 2 weeks,
the mice were sacrificed to separate each organ and to measure the
weight of the lungs. The fluorescence imaging of mice pulmonary metastasis
of CT26 cells was performed as follows. ICI nanocomposites (injection
volume: 0.2 mL, dose: 20 mg/kg) were administered into the tail vein
of BALb/C mice (0.2 mL). For comparison, atezolizumab-Ce6 conjugates
and atezolizumab-Ce6/MePEG conjugates were also i.v. administered.
Injection volumes and dose were 0.2 mL and 20 mg/kg. The injection
dose of each conjugate was based on ICI. Twenty-four hours later,
the mice were sacrificed to observe each organ with a Maestro 2TM
in vivo imaging system (Cambridge Research and Instruments, Inc.,
Woburn, MA01801) at 780 nm. Animal experiments in this study were
carried out based on the guidelines of the Pusan National University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (PNUIACUC). Experimental
protocol of animal study was strictly reviewed by PNUIACUC in terms
of ethical procedures and scientific care and approved (approval number:
PNU-2017-1610).
