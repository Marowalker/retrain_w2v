Introduction
The tetrahydroisoqunioline ring system
is a privileged fundamental
scaffold of various alkaloids isolated from natural sources and abundantly
found in various plants, soils, and marine microorganisms.1 Molecules embedded with these scaffolds are important
pharmaceutical intermediates in medicinal chemistry and have gained
distinctive attention because of their broad spectrum of pharmacological
properties. Many tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds are considered as
antitumor,2,3 anticonvulsant, antithrombotic,4 analgesic,5 anti-inflammatory,6 antifungal, and antibacterial agents.7 Moreover, tetrahydroisoquinolines are useful
compounds as antagonist to NMDA and D1 receptors,8 Parkinson’s disease,9 enzyme inhibitory actions for glucosidases,10 and monoamine oxidases.11 Isolated alkaloids
from natural sources containing the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety
are broadly abundant in many biologically active compounds (Figure 1). Higenamine 1 extracted from the leaves of Aristolochia
brasiliensis has been recognized as an agonist for
the β2-adrenergic receptor12−14 and antimycobacterial12 and anti-inflammatory drugs.14,15 The complex
α-substituted tetrahydroisoquinoline, Noscapine 2, revealed an antiproliferative activity against human prostate cancer
cells.16,17 Oleracin E 3 has been established
as an antioxidant and antidepressant agent.18,19 The catechol-derived tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid Salsolinol 4 plays an important role in pathogenic treatment associated
with Parkinson’s diseases.20−23 Despite thienoquinolines and
thienoisoquinolines being poorly represented in nature, they are important
compounds in medicinal chemistry. Related compounds exhibit antileukemic24 and antibacterial activities;25 also, they were proved as vasodilators.26

Figure 1 Structures of naturally occurring and biologically active tetrahydroisoquinolines.

In the light of the prior biological activities
of tetrahydroisoquinolines
and in resumption of our project for synthesis of new heterocycles
containing the thienotetrahydroisoquinolines moiety,27−34 we have announced here preparation of the new 1-amino-2-substituted
and 1-pyrrolyl-2-substituted-5-piperidinyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-c]isoquinolines and their fused heterocycles which have
proved promising antibacterial and antifungal activities parallel
to the standard drugs.

Results and Discussion
Our strategy is initiated with
synthesis of 3-thioxo-1-piperidinyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroisoquinoline-4-carbonitrile
substrate (2) which is an essential intermediate for
preparation of the new tetrahydrothieno[2,3-c]isoquinolines
by the reaction of isothiochromene 1 with piperidine
via Dimroth(35) rearrangement
in an excellent yield. The thione 2 was permitted to
react with several α-halo carbonyl compounds (e.g. chloroacetone,
ethyl chloroacetate, 2-bromoacetophenone, chloroacetamide, and chloroacetanilide)
in refluxing ethanol and fused sodium acetate to afford the corresponding
S-alkylated products 3a–e, which in turn underwent
Thorpe–Ziegler cyclization36 upon
heating with sodium ethoxide solution in ethanol producing the target
o-bifunctionally substituted thieno[2,3-c]isoquinolines 4a–e. The latter compounds were obtained via an alternative
route, upon reaction of 2 with the mentioned α-halo
carbonyl compounds using anhydrous potassium carbonate as a basic
catalyst instead of sodium acetate. The products that were created
by the two methods were identical in all features. Elucidation of
the chemical structures of 4a–e was confirmed
from their spectral analyses. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) of 4a revealed bands at 3449 and 3271 cm–1 specific
for NH2 and at 1589 cm–1 characteristic
for CO. 1H NMR in CDCl3 exhibited two singlets
at δ 2.39 and 7.20 ppm attributed to CH3 and NH2 groups. 13C NMR of 4a displayed signal
at δ 192.32 ppm for CO unique for the acetyl group (Scheme 1).

Furthermore, treatment of the amino-acetyl and
amino-ester derivatives 4a and 4b with 2,5-dimethyl
tetrahydrofuran afforded
the corresponding pyrrolyl derivatives 5a and 5b. The IR spectrum of 5b emerged with the absence of
bands at 3493 and 3337 distinctive to the NH2 group with
a band at 1657 specific for the CO ester. 1H NMR of 5b affirmed the absence of the singlet signal attributed to
NH2 in 4b and the presence of multiplet signals
at δ 6.20–6.33 and 7.15–7.46 particular for the
pyrrolyl protons, in addition to triplet and quartet signals at δ
1.34–1.38 and 4.28–4.33 characteristic for CH3 and CH2 of the ethoxyl group, respectively. 13C NMR in CDCl3 exhibited signals at 14.55, 60.06, and
166.08 specific for CH3, CH2, and CO of the
ethoxyl group. The pyrrolyl acetyl 5a was used as a basic
intermediate for production of new heterocycles. When the pyrrolyl
acetyl 5a was subjected to react with dimethylformamide
dimethylacetal (DMFDMA) in DMF, the corresponding dimethyl amino-2-propenone 6 was obtained. Similarly, condensation of 5a with different aromatic aldehydes developed formation of the corresponding
chalcone derivatives 7a–c. 1H NMR of 7a emphasized disappearance of the signal at δ 1.95
ppm specific for CH3 of the acetyl group and emergence
of multiplet signals at δ 7.33–7.45 particular for aromatic
protons. The 13C NMR spectrum showed signals at 128.65–130.27
ppm characteristic for the carbon atoms of the phenyl ring. Also,
the mass spectrum of 7a exhibited peaks at 467.34 and
as a molecular ion and at 84.15 as a base peak. Therefore, reaction
of chalcone 7a with phenyl hydrazine and hydroxyl amine
hydrochloride afforded the pyrazolyl and isoxazolyl derivatives 8 and 9. The homogeneity of the chemical structures
for the latter compounds was confirmed by elemental and spectral techniques. 1H NMR of compound 8 represented doublet and triplet
signals at δ 3.63–3.70 and 5.03–5.18 attributed
to CH2 and CHPh of pyrazole. Also, 13C NMR exhibited
signals at δ 51.05 and 64.81 for CH2 and CH pyrazole
(Scheme 2).

Various Chalcones, Pyrazolyl, and Isoxazolyl Compounds 6–9
Moreover, hydrazinolysis of the ester 5b with hydrazine
hydrate provided the corresponding carbohydrazide 10. 1H NMR in CDCl3 represented two singlets at δ
3.89 and 6.26 accredited to NH2 and NH. 13C
NMR emerged signal at δ 162.70 specific for the CONH group. Cyclocondensation of the carbohydrazide 10 with acetyl acetone37 in ethanol produced
first the corresponding pentylidene Schiff’s base 11 followed by cyclization upon reflux in acetic acid to produce the
dimethyl pyrazolyl derivative 12 in a moderate yield.
FT-IR of 12 showed absence of bands assigned to NH and COCH3 groups. The 1H NMR spectrum
represented singlet signals at δ 1.27 and 1.65 ppm unique for
the two pyrazolyl methyl groups. 13C NMR of 12 exhibited a signal at δ 164.90 particular for the carbonyl
group. In a similar manner, condensation of the carbohydrazide 10 with triethylorthoformate in existence of catalytic acetic
acid drops provided the ethoxymethylene carbohydrazide 13. FT-IR of 13 revealed the NH absorption band at 3332
cm–1. 1H NMR represented triplet and
quartet signals at δ 1.31–1.34 and 4.00–4.05 specific
for the ethoxyl group (Scheme 3).

Conclusions
In the current study, we have provided
a facile approach for synthesis
of unique piperidinyl tetrahydrothieno[2,3-c]isoquinolines
based on various reactions of the pyrrolyl—acetyl 5a and pyrrolyl—ester derivatives 5b. The isolated
products were easily purified by recrystallization from the proper
solvents. Alternatively, most of the synthesized products revealed
promising antibacterial and antifungal activities against various
genera of bacteria and fungi. Therefore, this sophisticated strategy
could be utilized for synthesis of compounds that are medicinally
and pharmaceutically significant.

Biological Activity
Recently, developing new and more effective antimicrobial therapies have
become one of the greatest concerns for human health, which has attracted
considerable attention of the scientists worldwide as a result to
the development of resistance to the present antimicrobial remedy.
Therefore, one of the main targets of our study is synthesis of new
compounds having superior importance in biological and medicinal chemistry.
The selected compounds 5a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 7c were screened for their in
vitro inhibitory effect versus a panel of pathogenic genera of Gram
positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria
(Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) in addition to four strains of
pathogenic fungi Geotrichum candidum, Candida albicans, Trichophyton rubrum, and Aspergillus
flavus. The inhibition zones (mm) and minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) (μg/mL) of the tested compounds were compared
with amoxicillin and clotrimazole as antibacterial and antifungal
reference medicines.

Antibacterial Activity
The antibacterial assessment
results for the tested compounds indicated
significant activity and were summarized in Table 1. Compounds 5a and 6 exhibited the highest activities against all genera of bacteria
(MIC 7.0–9.0 μg/mL) parallel to amoxicillin (MIC 3.0–5.0
μg/mL). Compounds 5a, 6, and 7b represented the best activities against B. cereus with MIC (7.0–9.0 μg/mL) compared
to amoxicillin (MIC 4.0 μg/mL), while compounds 7a and 7c displayed moderate effects. In case of S. aureus, all of the tested compounds revealed significant
activities against all strains of Gram positive and Gram negative
bacteria (MIC 8.0–9.0 μg/mL) with very close inhibition
zones (15–19 mm) compared to the reference drug (21 mm and
MIC 3.0 μg/mL). Alternatively, compounds 5a, 6, and 7b were found to be the most active derivatives
versus P. aeruginosa with MIC values
9.0, 9.0, and 7.0 μg/mL, respectively, whereas compounds 7c exhibited moderate activities (MIC 11 μg/mL) compared
to amoxicillin. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa was resistant to compound 7a. Moreover, compounds 5a, 6, 7a, and 7c displayed
strong effectiveness against E. coli (MIC 8.0–9.0 μg/mL), whereas compound 7b displayed moderate action in comparison with the original antibacterial
agent (MIC 5.0 μg/mL).

Antifungal Activity
It is interesting to mention that
the results of antifungal screening
for the tested compounds revealed promising impacts against all kinds
of fungi as indicated in Table 2. From the antifungal data, we found that compounds 5a, 6, 7b, and 7c exhibited
intense activities against Geotrichum candidum (MIC 8.0–9.0 μg/mL) relative to the clotrimazole reference
drug (MIC 5.0 μg/mL), while G. candidium was resistant to compound 7a. Subsequently, compounds 5a, 6, 7b, and 7c showed
good activities against C. albicans, while compound 7a displayed moderate activity (MIC
10.0 μg/mL). In case of T. rubrum, compound 4a represented the best antifungal activity
(MIC 7.0 μg/mL) which is almost the same as clotrimazole (MIC
6.0 μg/mL), while compounds 6, 7a,
and 7b exhibited the highest inhibition zones (19–21
mm) which are very close to that of the reference drug (25 mm). However,
compound 7c exhibited inferior activity (MIC 11 μg/mL)
toward T. rubrum. Additionally, compounds 4a, 7a, and 7b revealed strong activities
(MIC 9.0 μg/mL) againstA. flavus, while compound 7c displayed moderate activity. At
the same time, A. flavus was resistant
to the effect of compound 6 compared with clotrimazole
(MIC 4.0 μg/mL).

Structure–Activity Relationship
Tetrahydroisoquinolines
hold a prominent place in organic and medicinal
chemistry. Accordingly, we tried to investigate the influence of various
chalcone compounds containing the piperidinyl thienotetrahydroisoquinoline
moiety on the microbial inhibitory activity. From the data which are
recorded in Table 3, we can deduce that the pyrrolyl-acetyl starting material 5a revealed strong antibacterial activity against all tested
strains of bacteria. Formation of the chalcone compound 6 increases the antibacterial activity toward E. coli and slightly decreases the effect against B. cereus, S. aureus, and P.
aeruginosa. Alternatively, reaction of the pyrrolyl-acetyl 5a with different aldehydes to form the corresponding chalcone
compounds 7a, 7b, and 7c strongly
affected on the antibacterial activity. Therefore, reaction with benzaldehyde
to form the chalcone 7a strongly increases the effect
against S. aureus and E. coli with moderate activity against B. cereus as well as no activity against P. aeruginosa. It is noticeable that substitution
of the phenyl ring in benzaldehyde by the nitro group (electron withdrawing
group EWG) 7c strongly enhances activity against P. aeruginosa, in addition to moderate or good activity
against E. coli. However, substitution
by the methoxyl group (electron-donating group) 7b increases
the activity against S. aureus and E. coli with moderate to good activities against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa.

Additionally, the recently synthesized compounds exhibited
variable
degrees of fungal inhibitory activity. Compound 5a revealed
high activity against all genera of fungi, while reaction with DMFDMA
to form the chalcone 6 slightly decreases the effect
against C. albicans and T. rubrum. Antifungal activity of compound 6 against G. candidium is very
close to the effect of 5a, showing inferior activity
against A. flavus. Furthermore, reaction
of 5a with benzaldehyde to form chalcone 7a slightly decreases the activity against C. albicans and T. rubrum. The effect of chalcone 7a is very similar to 5a against A. flavus with inferior activity versus G. candidium. Substitution of the phenyl ring of
benzaldehyde with electron withdrawing group (NO2) 7c or electron donating group (OCH3) 7b strongly enhanced the activity against G. candidium by increasing the activity against C. albicans and T. rubrum. The methoxyl group
in compound 7b slightly reduced the efficacy against A. flavus, while substitution by the nitro group
did not influence the activity as compared to 7a.

Development of a 2D-QSAR Model
The descriptor reflects
the molecular merits. The screening of
various significant molecular descriptors from many other ones is
an imperative procedure in the QSAR research. The best QSAR model
should have appropriate number of descriptors.  N and D represent
the number of compounds and descriptors, respectively.

In our
study, the number of compounds tested for antibacterial
and antifungal activity is limited (only five compounds). Therefore,
to meet the criteria the QSAR equation will contain only one descriptor.

A simple 2D-QSAR analyses for antibacterial activity and antifungal
activities of the prepared derivatives (5a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 7c) was performed
using MOE 2019 software.

A set of the synthesized compounds 5a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 7c was used
as a training set with their measured MIC against B.
cereus and C. albicans for QSAR modeling. MIC values against B. cereus and C. albicans were chosen for QSAR
modeling; they were the training set compounds that showed best activity.
A database for the training set compounds was established and different
molecular 2D descriptors was calculated using MOE 2019 software. Next,
the “best multilinear regression” was determined. In
our study, PLS regression analysis was used to calculate the relationship
between bioactivity and the descriptors. The QSAR model was validated
employing leave one-out cross-validation.

2D QSAR Study Results
In the 2D-QSAR equation development
for B. cereus, the regression equation
indicated that the total hydrophobic vdw
surface area (PEOE_VSA_HYD) of the training set compounds has a contribution
to the inhibitory activity (eq 1). The correlation coefficient (r2) is 0.81, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 0.61. The predicted
values are plotted versus experimental MIC results of the training
set compounds against B. cereus, as
given in Figure 2. Best performing QSAR model for the activity

The total hydrophobic vdw surface area (PEOE_VSA_HYD)
of the training
set compounds showed also an influence on the inhibitory activity
against C. albicans (eq 2). The correlation coefficient (r2) is 0.62, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE)
is 0.61. The predicted values are plotted versus experimental MIC

Experimental Section
The required chemicals in this
work were purchased from Merck Sigma-Aldrich
and Loba chemicals. All melting points were uncorrected and determined
on a Fisher–John apparatus. Elemental analyses were performed
at the Micro Analytical Center of Chemistry Department, Assiut University,
Egypt. The FT-IR spectra were recorded using potassium bromide disks
on a FT-IR8201PC Shimadzu. H and C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectra were recorded on Bruker BioSpin GmbH spectrometers and Varian
Mercury VX-300NMR (1H 400 MHz, 13C NMR 100 MHz)
in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 using
tetramethylsilane (Me4Si) as the internal standard. Chemical
shifts were expressed as ppm. Mass spectra were measured on a Joel-JMS
600 spectrometer at Chemistry Department—Assiut University,
Egypt. All reactions were monitored by the thin-layer chromatography
technique on silica gel-coated aluminum sheets (Silica gel60 F254, Merck). The amino isothiochromene carbonitrile compound 1 was synthesized according to the literature procedure.38

bath at 100 °C for 6 h under solvent-free conditions. After the
reaction was completed, a solution of absolute ethanol (15 mL) and
acetic acid (6 mL) was appended, and then, reflux was resumed for
additional 10 min and was left to cool. The precipitated solid which
was formed on cooling was collected and recrystallized from the ethanol/dioxane
mixture (1:1) as red crystals in 80% (4.00 g) yield. mp 208–210

Procedure of In Vitro Antibacterial Assay
All microorganisms
utilized were attained from the culture combination of Microbiology
Department, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University. A variety of Gram-negative
(E. coli and Pseudomonas
aeruginosa) and Gram-positive bacterial strains (S. aureus and B. cereus) was used to measure the efficacy of various synthesized compounds
utilizing 5 mL solution of the synthesized compounds in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) as a solvent. The examined compounds were primarily estimated
by maximum concentration at 100 μg/mL in DMSO and amoxicillin
as a reference. The sterile medium (Nutrient Agar Medium, 15 mL) in
every Petri dish was uniformly smeared with cultures of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria. The plates were incubated at 37 ±
2 °C for 24 h.

Procedure of In Vitro Antifungal Assay
The fungal strains
(C. albicans, A. flavus, G. candidium, and T. rubrum) were gained from selected conditions of
human dermatophytosis (Assiut University Mycological Center, AUMC).
The fungal kinds were developed in sterilized 9 cm Petri dishes containing
Sabouraud’s dextrose agar (SDA) supplemented with 0.05% of
amoxicillin to inhibit contamination of bacteria.40 The agar disks (10 mm diameter) containing spores from
these cultures were aseptically transferred to screw-topped vials
containing 20 mL sterile distilled water. After shaking, samples of
the spore suspension (1 mL) were pipetted into sterile Petri dishes,
followed by the addition of 15 mL liquefied SDA medium which was then
left to solidify. The screened compounds 5a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 7c and the reference
drug (clotrimazole) were dissolved in DMSO to provide 2.0% concentration.
The inoculated plates were incubated at room temperature for 4 days.

Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the tested compounds
were determined consistent with the strategy described by Kwon-Chung
and Bennett39 using 5 mm diameter wells
loaded with 50 μL of the solution under study. Furthermore,
stock solutions of the standard drugs (amoxicillin and clotrimazole)
were prepared in DMSO and 100 μg/mL concentration utilized for
antimicrobial and antifungal efficiency. The zones of inhibition were
determined and listed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Procedure of In Vitro Inhibition Zone and MIC
The examined
compounds (5a, 6, 7a, 7b, and 7c) to be screened were dissolved in
DMSO to afford a solution of 2% concentration. Filter paper discs (Whatman no. 3) with about 5 mm in diameter were saturated
with 15 mL of the tested compound solutions and then placed on the
surface of the previously prepared agar plates which seeded by the
tested bacteria. To ensure complete contact with the agar surface,
each disc was immersed down. Subsequently, the agar plates were incubated
at 37 °C for 16–18 h for bacteria and then at room temperature.
The zones’ diameters of the compound inhibition were measured
and recorded in the previous table. A similar procedure39,40 was implemented for commercial antibiotics amoxicillin which was
utilized as the positive control for bacteria. The MIC of every compound
was determined by the microdilution method. The biologically active
compounds were successively diluted in DMSO and incubated with 10
mL broth tubes vaccinated with the examined culture for 24 h. MIC
of each compound was measured as the lowest concentration (μg
mL–1) that did not display any visible bacteria.
