Over
the last decade, we have developed a molecular-controlled
semiconductor resistor (MOCSER) device that is highly sensitive to
variations in its surface potentials. This device was applied as a
molecular sensor both in the gas phase and in solutions. The device
is based on an AlGaAs/GaAs structure. In the current work, we developed
an electronic biosensor for real-time, label-free monitoring of cellular
metabolic activity by culturing HeLa cells directly on top of the
device’s conductive channel. Several properties of GaAs make
it attractive for developing biosensors, among others its high electron
mobility and ability to control the device’s properties by
proper epitaxial growing. However, GaAs is very reactive and sensitive
to oxidation in aqueous solutions, and its arsenic residues are highly
toxic. Nevertheless, we have managed to overcome this inherent chemical
instability by developing a surface-protecting layer using polymerized
(3-mercaptopropyl)-trimethoxysilane
(MPTMS). To improve cell adhesion and biocompatibility, the MPTMS-coated
devices were further modified with an additional layer of (3-aminopropyl)-trimethoxysilane
(APTMS). HeLa cells were found to grow successfully on these devices,
and MOCSER devices cultured with these cells were stable and sensitive
to cellular metabolic activity. The sensitivity of the MOCSER device
results from the sensing of extracellular acidification in the microenvironment
of the cell-MOCSER interspace. We have found that this sensitivity
is maintained only when the device is partially covered with the cellular
layer, whereas at full coverage the sensitivity is lost. This phenomenon
is related to the negatively charged cellular membrane potentials
that lead to a reduction in the channel’s conductivity. We
propose that the coated MOCSER device can be applied for real-time
and continuous monitoring of cellular viability and activity.

Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic
electronic biosensors1−3 are an attractive tool for monitoring chemical/molecular
processes;
thus, they could assist in a wide range of applications, such as developing
and screening new drugs4,5 and detecting hazardous toxins.3,6 The importance of developing cell-based biosensors, despite the
limitations imposed by the limited life span of single cells, is that
such systems, based on living cells, can directly reveal physiological
and functional information about the living state of cells and their
response to external, physical, and chemical stimuli.7,8

The state of living cells can be monitored by several methods.9−11 One of the main methods is to monitor the cellular metabolism.12−14 Cells consume energy to maintain vital cellular functions, such
as synthesizing various compounds and for maintaining their transcellular
membrane gradients. This energy consumption leads to the creation
of metabolic end products, such as CO2 and lactic acid.
As a result, the extracellular medium (ECM) becomes acidified.15−19 For example, under steady-state conditions, a single cell produces
∼108 protons per s.20 Respiration is the major pathway for the production of ATP from
glucose in vivo, whereas glycolysis predominates in vitro,19,21 with a greater extent of ECM acidification.

Silicon-based
electrolyte oxide field-effect transistors (FETs),
especially ion-selective FETs, are the most commonly used transducers
for monitoring this acidification process.22−25 In FET devices, the presence
of molecules defines the gate potential, which alters the channel’s
conductivity. The shortcomings of FET-based devices are mainly low
sensitivity, owing to drift at the gate electrode, and lack of stability
in harsh environments.26

Two decades
ago, we proposed the molecular-controlled semiconductor
resistor (MOCSER) technology, a FET-like device, in which the gate
electrode was replaced by a molecular layer adsorbed directly on the
semiconductor surface.27−29 This device is based on a two-dimensional electron
gas structure of AlGaAs/GaAs, and it was applied for developing molecular
sensing systems both in the gas phase30,31 and in solutions.32−35 Several properties make this technology useful for developing molecular
sensors, among them is the high electron mobility channel in the form
of 2D electron gas and the ability to obtain enhanced sensitivity
by proper band gap engineering and epitaxial growth. Moreover, by
applying the relevant surface chemistry, it is possible to directly
adsorb molecules on top of the GaAs semiconductor without an oxide
intermediate, thus enabling sensing mechanisms directly through surface
states. The electronic properties of the adsorbed molecules define
the surface chemical potential, which leads to a change in the device’s
surface states, which in turn defines the band bending in the semiconductor
and affects the currents passing through it.32,36

One of the drawbacks of GaAs is its susceptibility to form
an unstable
oxide under ambient conditions. In an aqueous environment, this oxide
formation may be even more prominent, resulting in the release of
toxic arsenic species.37,38 However, we have managed to overcome
the inherent chemical instability of GaAs by developing a surface-protecting
layer using a polymerized 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPTMS)
layer. This layer was polymerized on top of the device, thus avoiding
the direct exposure of the GaAs surface to water or humidity.35,39

In the present work, we aimed to develop a cell-based biosensor,
using the MOCSER technology, by culturing cells directly on top of
the device’s active channel. This technology enables a real-time
and label-free monitoring of the cellular viability by sensing cellular
metabolic activity.

Experimental Section
Human HeLa,
cervical adenocarcinoma cell line, was used to perform
the experiments. The cells were cultured according to standard protocols
used by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) organization.
The culturing was carried out in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Gibco cat. no. 41965). The culture medium for the measurements
was a CO2-independent medium (Gibco, cat. no. 18045-054),
thus allowing us to conduct the electrical measurements without the
need for a constant CO2 supply. Both media, namely, DMEM
and CO2-independent medium, were supplied with 1% of 200
mM l-glutamine (Biological Industries, cat. no. 03-020-1B),
10% of fetal bovine serum (Gibco, cat. no. 12657-029), and 1% of penicillin/streptomycin
antibiotics solution (Biological Industries). The cells were passaged
every 2–3 days, using a trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution (0.25% trypsin–0.02% EDTA, Biological
Industries, cat. no. 03-050-1B), when 80% confluency was reached.

Device
Fabrication
MOCSER devices were fabricated based
on a preexamined AlGaAs/InGaAs/GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility
transistor structure.32,35 The eventual devices were designed
to carry 16 conductive channels, having dimensions of 600 μm
long by 200 μm wide, separated by 200 μm uniform spaces,
to minimize cross-talking and leakage of currents between the channels.
The devices were fabricated by standard photolithography procedures.
Ohmic contacts were made by the e-beam evaporation of metallic layers
for forming n-type ohmic contacts as follows: Ni/Au/Ge/Ni/Au (50/600/300/200/1000
Å), respectively. The conductive channels were isolated by mesa
etching with a soft piranha solution of H2O/H2O2/H2SO4 (40:8:1) to ensure a flow
of current solely between the device contacts. Finally, the device
was coated with a 30 nm passivation layer of AlOx, and selective openings were made to expose the pads for wire
bonding and the channels for molecular sensing. The resulting device
produced a general resistance of about 2.5 kΩ, with a contact
resistance of 1 ± 0.3 Ω·mm and a sheet resistance
of 850 ± 45 Ω.

Molecular Modification with APTMS–MPTMS
The
GaAs-based MOCSER devices were coated using a protective and functionalized
layer of MPTMS according to a procedure that was previously developed
in our lab.39 The resulting 15–18
nm layer allowed the MOCSER device to operate continuously and in
a stable manner in harsh biological environments.33−35 The MPTMS polymer
surface was further modified with an additional layer of APTMS, to
improve cell adhesion and biocompatibility. Briefly, the MOCSER devices
coated with MPTMS were treated with an ultraviolet ozone cleaning
system for 20 s to hydroxylate the surface, followed by the addition
of 50 μL/mL of APTMS in ethanol, with 75 μL/mL of NH4OH as a condensation agent. The samples were kept at room
temperature for 24 h. The resulting additional APTMS polymer thickness
was estimated by ellipsometry measurements to be 5 nm.

Experimental
Setup and Apparatus
To encapsulate the
MOCSER device and to conduct wet electrical measurements and cell
cultivations, an assembly consisting of a Petri dish above a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) well (5 × 5 × 5 mm) was constructed and used (see Figure 1). This assembly
was mounted on top of the MOCSER device, using a biocompatible UV-curable
adhesive NOA81 (Norland Optical Adhesives).

Figure 1 (A) Schematic representation
of the encapsulated MOCSER device,
where cells are cultured within a PDMS well assembly. (B) Schematic
representation of the experimental setup for real-time, electrical
monitoring of cellular activity under well-controlled physiological
conditions.

Before cell cultivation,
the encapsulated MOCSER was disinfected
with 70% ethanol. The device was then preincubated for 20 min with
a growth medium solution of DMEM. Incubation was carried out in a
humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The cultured
cells were then treated with a trypsin–EDTA solution and passaged
to the MOCSER assembly. The passage was performed by pipetting 100
μL of the cell culture solution containing 5 × 103 cells; the cell number was determined using a TC20 automated cell
counter (Bio-Rad #145-0101). The cells were cultured on the device
for 16 h in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 in DMEM to allow the cells to adhere to the surface of the MOCSER
device. After a 16 h preincubation period, the medium above the cells
was exchanged with a CO2-independent medium. Finally, the
whole system was transferred to a mini-incubator (Hy Laboratories
Ltd) that maintained the experimental apparatus under a controlled
environment of 37 °C, and the measurement was initiated.

Electrical
Measurements
Sixteen channels per device
were measured simultaneously using a Keithley 2636A source measure
unit and a home-built switch control box, which was controlled and
monitored by a LabVIEW program. The HeLa cellular metabolic activity
was measured over 6 h using pulsed cycles at a constant source–drain
voltage of 0.6 V. Within the pulses, the “on” state
was set to 3 min (the time needed for the signal to stabilize), whereas
the “off” state was set to 20 min to reduce the electrical
load on the cells, yet enough to maintain measurable electrical currents
and responses.

To test the device’s sensitivity in the
CO2-independent medium solution, calibration plots were
measured for various pH solutions. All pH measurements throughout
the experiments were performed using a commercial pH meter (portable
pH-meter 1120 with a 3 mm InLab 423 combination pH micro electrode,
Mettler Toledo International, Inc.). Moreover, source–drain
current (Isd) versus voltage (Vsd) characteristics at various gate voltages
(Vg) were applied using an external gate.
Here, to apply gate voltages without currents, a Pt wire electrode
was coated with a SixNy dielectric layer of 300 nm, using a plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition tool. These measurements were conducted both on bare
MOCSERs and on MOCSERs coated with a monolayer of HeLa cells.

Microscopic
Imaging
Optical microscopy images of HeLa
cells cultured on top of the MOCSER device were acquired using an
Olympus BX-62 microscope in a bright-field/reflection mode, using
a 10× air objective. The images were recorded with a complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera (Neo sCMOS; Andor Technology)
using Andor Solis software.

Measurement of the Extracellular Acidification
Rate (ECAR) by
Using the Seahorse XF Analyzer
The ECAR was measured by using
the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer (Agilent Technologies). Briefly, HeLa
cells were cultured in a dedicated 96-well plate at a seeding concentration
of 1 × 104 cells/well. The culturing was carried out
in DMEM growth medium for 16 h in a humidified 37 °C incubator
with 5% CO2. Before measurements were taken, the growth
medium was exchanged with a nonbuffered XF base medium (Seahorse Bioscience,
cat. no. 102353-100) containing 4 mM l-glutamine. The ECAR
was measured under basal conditions and in response to different glucose
concentrations ranging from a 0.1 to 10 mM (2.5 M d-(+)-glucose
solution, Sigma-Aldrich, G8769). The ECAR was reported as an absolute
acidification rate (i.e., ΔpH/min) and normalized against cell
counts using the Hoechst reagent (Molecular Probes, cat. no. H3750).

Results and Discussion
Culturing of HeLa Cells on the MOCSER Device
HeLa cells
were successfully cultured on top of GaAs surfaces and MOCSER devices
coated with MPTMS or APTMS–MPTMS polymers. Figure 2 shows optical microscopy images
of HeLa cells grown on top of four different samples: uncoated GaAs
substrate (i.e., negative control; Figure 2A), a standard culturing Petri dish (i.e.,
positive control; Figure 2B), a GaAs substrate coated with MPTMS (Figure 2C), and a GaAs substrate coated with APTMS–MPTMS
(Figure 2D). Figure 2C shows that cells
adhered suboptimally to the surfaces coated with the MPTMS layer.
This is due to the partially hydrophobic nature of the MPTMS layer
(having a contact angle of 70°). Surfaces coated with APTMS–MPTMS
(Figure 2D) were more
hydrophilic (i.e., having a contact angle of 45°), allowing better
adherence of cells. This is due to the introduction of amine groups
that enhance cell adhesion and thus provide favorable biocompatibility
for the cellular layer. In addition, the cells grown on bare GaAs
substrates exhibited an abnormal HeLa epithelial morphology, with
a low density of cells. The cells grown on the surfaces coated with
a layer of APTMS–MPTMS exhibited morphology and density similar
to that exhibited in a standard Petri dish.

Figure 2 HeLa cells cultured on
four different substrates, as imaged by
a light microscope: (A) HeLa cells grown on a bare GaAs substrate
(negative control); (B) HeLa cells grown on a Petri dish (positive
control); (C) HeLa cells grown on a GaAs substrate coated with a layer
of polymerized MPTMS; and (D) HeLa cells grown on GaAs coated with
a layer of APTMS–MPTMS. The insets on the right present a magnified
image of these surfaces.

The above-mentioned polymers not only provide a chemical
passivation
layer against the etching of GaAs in aqueous solution, but also serve
as an electrically stable receptor layer with different functionalized
groups, such as negatively charged thiols and positively charged amines
that are susceptible to pH variations.

I–V Characterization
of the MOCSER Device
Figure 3 shows the obtained source–drain current (Isd) versus the source–drain voltage (Vsd) at various gate voltages (Vgs) for a MOCSER device coated with a monolayer of HeLa
cells (the continuous dotted line) and a bare MOCSER device (the dotted
line). In this set of measurements, the Vg was applied using a platinum wire electrode just above the channel.
The gate voltages were increased up to the point of gate current leakage
of 250 nAmp. The electrical measurements were performed in a CO2-independent medium solution at pH 7.2. These I–V characteristics show that even in a physiological
environment, the GaAs MOCSER device maintains its n-type depleted-mode
characteristics. It can be clearly seen that at Vg = 0 V, the current drops, for a device coated with a
monolayer of HeLa cells, to a point that represents an almost closed
channel. This drop is related to channel modulation attributed to
the accumulation of negatively charged cell membranes on the channel
surface. When Vg = 1 V is applied, the
channel’s resistance is restored to its original resistance.
On the other hand, by applying negative voltages on the bare device,
the current drops to the base current of the cell-coated devices (see Figure S1).

Figure 3 I–V characteristics of
the MOCSER device coated with a HeLa cell monolayer (the continuous
dotted line) compared with a bare MOCSER device (the dotted line)
at varying gate voltages (Vgs). A forward
sweep was used, ranging from Vg = 0 V
to Vg = 1 V (0.5 V increments), and a
forward source–drain voltage (Vsd) sweep was used, ranging from Vsd =
0 V to Vsd = 0.6 V (0.05 increments).

pH Sensitivity and Stability
under Physiological Conditions
Because the immediate measure
of cellular activity is related to
the release of acidic byproducts by the cells, we conducted a calibration
measurement in which a CO2-independent medium (pH 7.2)
was titrated with hydrochloric acid down to pH 1 (see Figure 4) with increments of 1 pH unit. Figure 4 shows that the current
of the conductive channel, Isd, increases
with the acidity of the solution (decreasing the pH). This titration
plot exhibits a sensitivity of about −4 μA/pH. The shoulder
in the plot, at pH = 6, is related to the composition of the CO2-independent medium, containing a unique buffering system
composed of mono- and dibasic sodium phosphate (pKa 6.85 at 25 °C) and β-glycerophosphate (pKa 6.30 at 25 °C).

Figure 4 MOCSER source–drain
current as a function of different pH
values in CO2-independent medium ranging from pH 7.2 to
pH 1.

The MOCSER response exhibited
a similar trend, when a standard
phosphate buffer solution (150 mM) was titrated within its buffer
zone with only a sensitivity of about −7.5 μA/pH (see Figure S2).

The MOCSER response shows a
logarithmic dependence on the concentration
of protons in the solution. This behavior can be explained by utilizing
the site-binding model and based on the Nernst equation, in which
the surface potential is affected by the ionic strength of the solution.40 The pH response of MOCSER was found to be similar
to that of APTMS–MPTMS and MPTMS polymer-modified MOCSER devices.35 It has been shown that the resistance of the
channel is determined by the change in the surface/electrolyte interfacial
potential (Δψ). These potential changes are caused by
surface protonation; therefore, both Δψ and ΔI correspond to the Δ(pI – pH) term, where
the pH value is defined for a tested solution and the pI value is
the isoelectric point of the polymer coating the surface. When the
pH of a tested solution is above/below the pI value of the surface,
the surface becomes either protonated or deprotonated, respectively.
The pI value of APTMS was found to be 2.1, whereas the pI value of
MPTMS is 9.7. Because the amine groups of the APTMS layer are expected
to be protonated, over the studied pH range, the change in current
should be mainly defined by the protonation/deprotonation of the MPTMS
and the APTMS polymer layers excluding the amine groups.

Demonstration
of HeLa Metabolic Activity through ECM Acidification
To confirm
that the HeLa cellular metabolic activity leads to ECM
acidification, the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer was used. Briefly, the
ECARs were measured for various glucose concentrations of 0.1, 1,
and 10 mM over a dense coverage of cells (see Figure S3). Because the ECAR assay actually measures the pH
of the bulk medium, the assay medium should be free of sodium bicarbonate
and should possess a low buffer capacity. Therefore, before performing
an assay, the growth medium was exchanged with a nonbuffered XF base
medium. Figure 5 shows
that the HeLa cell line used was metabolically active and that its
metabolic activity increases with increasing glucose concentrations.

Figure 5 ECAR (mpH/min/cells)
response of HeLa cells to various glucose
concentrations: 0.1, 1, and 10 mM.

Sensing HeLa Cellular Metabolic Activity by the MOCSER Device
For real-time monitoring of the HeLa cellular metabolic activity,
the MOCSER devices were cultured with HeLa cells on top of the MOCSER
devices. The activity was tested by measuring the cellular-coated
devices in a commercial CO2-independent medium, supplemented
with a glucose concentration of 0.7 g/L (4 mM). The devices were measured
for 6 h by electrically pulsed cycles. In parallel with the electrical
measurements, the pH of the buffer solution, above the cellular layer,
was found to be 7.0 ± 0.2 throughout the experiments as probed
by a commercial pH meter. This result is explained by the presence
of a buffering system in the bulk medium.

Figure 6 shows the typical output signals as a function
of time obtained from different MOCSER devices when their channels
were covered with different concentrations of cells, ranging from
0 to 100%. It can be clearly seen that on partially covered MOCSER
devices (red and blue dotted curves; Figure 6A and their corresponding images; Figure 6B), an increase in
the source–drain current was measured in response to the cellular
metabolic activity, whereas no response could be measured for a fully
covered device (black curve). The most significant response was obtained
with 25% cell coverage, in which the source–drain current, Isd, increased by more than 30 μA.

Figure 6 (A) Source–drain
current as a function of time for four
different MOCSER devices cultured with varying concentrations of cells,
cultured on MOCSER device’s surface. (B) Corresponding optical
microscopy images.

We attribute this increase
in current to the acidification process
occurring in the cell-MOCSER interspace. We propose that the acidic
byproducts, released by the cells, diffuse into the surface-coated
polymer and protonate the charged species embedded in the APTMS–MPTMS
polymer layer. Consequently, this layer becomes more positively charged,
until the proton equilibrium in the interspace is reached. This process
occurs in the uniquely created cell-MOCSER interspace regions (see Figure 7), where protons
are secreted by the cells and are instantly sensed by the MOCSER device.
Here, the buffering environment is not effective in neutralizing the
acid. This mechanism is further supported by measurements obtained
when using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer, in which the sensor probe
is located as close as 200 μm above the cells; however, it could
not detect changes in ECAR with the elevated glucose concentration
in the same CO2-independent medium.

Figure 7 Schematic representation
of a cell cultured on top of the aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane
(APTMS)–MPTMS-coated MOCSER device.

Figure 6 also
indicates
that an inverse relation exists between the cell density on the MOCSER’s
channels and the base currents, as well as the device’s sensitivity
to extracellular acidification. For example, with increasing cellular
density, the device’s base current and the sensitivity to extracellular
acidification decrease. The black dotted curve in Figure 6A and its corresponding image
represent a fully covered MOCSER channel, where no significant changes
in Isd occur. This result is consistent
with the lowering of the MOCSER channel’s sensitivity owing
to the negative potential of the cellular membranes that close the
channel’s conductivity. The loss of sensitivity observed here
is not a result of a lack of cellular viability because:(a) The cellular morphology,
as seen by
a light microscope, is in accordance with the epithelial morphology
of living cells (lower image of Figure 6B as compared to that of Figure 2).

(b) The measurements conducted by the
Seahorse metabolic analysis method clearly indicate that the cells
are still very active on a fully dense well (see Figure S3).

(c) After treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100,
a lysing agent that leads to the detachment of cells from the device
surface (see Figure S4), the base current
is recovered.



This above-mentioned unique
sensing mechanism of our device, namely,
its ability to sense cellular metabolic activity in the cell-MOCSER
interspace, makes it especially suitable for monitoring cellular viability,
with the ability to detect changes in cellular viability instantaneously,
as compared to methods that rely on the sensing of changes in the
bulk medium.

The MOCSER device, with its present parameters,
suits for monitoring
few cells because its sensitivity decreases at high cellular confluences
on the channel. However, in principle, the parameters of the device
can be modified to overcome this limitation.

In the present
study, we developed a GaAs-based biosensor for measuring
cellular activity and viability. Its inherent chemical instability
was reinforced using a polymerized MPTMS protective layer, capped
with APTMS for increasing its biocompatibility and for enabling cell
culturing and cellular thriving on its surface. We presented a real-time
and continuous monitoring of the metabolic activity of HeLa cells
as a measure of cellular viability by sensing the extracellular acidification.
