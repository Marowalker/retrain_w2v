A scan-mode low-temperature
(<40 °C) atmospheric-pressure
helium (He) dielectric-barrier discharge jet (DBDjet) is applied to
treat nickel oxide (NiO) thin films for p–i–n perovskite
solar cells (PSCs). Reactive plasma species help reduce the trap density,
improve the transmittance and wettability, and deepen the valence
band maximum (VBM) level. A NiO surface with the lower trap density
surface of NiO allows better interfacial contact with the MAPbI3 layer and increases the carrier extraction capability. MAPbI3 can better crystallize on a more hydrophilic NiO surface,
thereby suppressing charge recombination from the grain boundary and
the interface. Further, the deeper VBM allows better band alignment
and reduces the probability of nonradiative recombination. NiO treatment
using He DBDjet with a scan rate of 0.3 cm/s can improve PSC efficiency
from 13.63 to 14.88%.

1 Introduction
The
feasibility of low-cost solution processes for realizing high-efficiency
perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has made this photovoltaic technology
attractive. Such processes have also enabled large-area deposition
by a roll-to-roll printing process to further reduce the fabrication
cost.1 In 2009, the first PSC was fabricated
with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.2 A few years later, a 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,Ndi-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9′-spirobifluorene
(spiro-OMeTAD) was introduced as a solid-state hole transport layer
(HTL).3 Because of the long diffusion length
of the perovskite layer, a high-performance planar PSC without the
mesoporous structure of the transport layer was developed.4−6 In 2013, the first p–i–n structure PSC with a PCE
of 3.9% was fabricated; it had a structure similar to that of an organic
photovoltaic cell.7 Owing to benefit including
easy fabrication, flexibility, and low hysteresis, many studies have
focused on developing p–i–n structure PSCs.8,9 Several organic molecules were introduced for significantly improving
the performance of p–i–n structure PSC.10−16 However, to improve stability, nickel oxide (NiO) as the HTL of
p–i–n structure PSC was launched.17−20 Nowadays, the PCE of PSCs has
been improved to 25.2% with a single-junction architecture and 28.0%
with a silicon-based tandem architecture.21

Plasma contains abundant ions and electrons that are chemically
reactive. It has applied extensively for surface modification and
syntheses of materials. Low-pressure plasma (LPP) technology has been
used to perform material deposition and surface treatment for PSCs.
Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition was used to deposit the
electron transport layer (ETL) for an n–i–p structure
PSC.22 Later, a PSC with an ETL deposited
by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition exhibited a PCE of 19%.23−25 LPPs have also been used for depositing transparent bottom electrodes.26,27 For material surface modification, an LPP was used for metal oxide
transport layer treatment of an n–i–p structure PSC;
an air LPP treatment increased the concentration of oxygen vacancies
in TiO2 and improved the PCE.28 A CO2 LPP was used to improve the surface hydrophilicity
and conductivity of a TiO2 layer and to reduce the defect-state
density, thereby improving the PCE of the PSC to 15.4%.29 Another study used a CO2 LPP to treat
TiO2 and realized a PCE of 18.1%.30 Room-temperature nitrogen LPP processing for treating SnO2 electrodes improved PSCs made on glass and flexible substrates.31 An oxygen LPP was used to treat a NiO film for
improving its wettability and deepening its valence band maximum (VBM)
level, leading to improved performance of the p–i–n
structure PSC.32 Ecofriendly mild oxygen
plasma-treated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene:poly(styrene sulfonate))
(PEDOT:PSS) has been used as an electrode for indium tin oxide-free
PSCs with a PCE of 10.5%.15 LPP also been
used to treat spiro-OMeTAD to realize better band alignment with the
perovskite layer in an n–i–p structure PSC.33 The surface energy and work function of various
conjugated polymers were ameliorated by oxygen LPP treatment, and
the PCE was improved to a maximum of 19%.34 Spiro-OMeTAD HTL was shown to be rapidly oxidized by Ar/O2 LPP treatment.35 The conductivity of
treated PEDOT:PSS was increased by mild Ar LPP treatment, leading
to a better PSC performance.36 Ar LPP treatment
has also been used for surface composition tuning for fabricating
high-efficiency PSCs and fast photodetectors.37

LPP is undoubtedly a stable and mature technology that has
been
used extensively in the fabrication of electronic devices. However,
LPP is a vacuum process, making it disadvantageous for integration
with solution processes of PSCs. Atmospheric pressure plasma (APP)
technology can be operated at regular pressures without using vacuum
systems; therefore, it is particularly suitable for integration into
the nonvacuum fabrication processes of dye-sensitive solar cells38−42 and PSCs.43−45 Typical APP technology includes transfer arc, dielectric
barrier discharge (DBD), corona discharge, and APP jet (APPJ). Recent
developments have overcome issues such as high breakdown voltage,
continuous arcing, and instability, making this technology ready for
practical usage.46−48 APP has a much shorter mean free path and thinner
sheath than LPP, and therefore its ion bombardment effect is limited;
it is particularly useful for the surface modification of materials
that are sensitive to ion bombardment damages. APPs with different
electrode designs and plasma excitation methods can be used to realize
plasmas with various heavy particle temperatures and electron densities.
Caution should be exercised to specify the APP properties when discussing
APP technology. Several APP techniques have been applied in PSC fabrication
processes. An air APPJ was used to convert scalable and robust perovskite
films for PSCs to achieve a remarkably consistent PCE of 15.7% without
hysteresis. In this case, an APPJ with a temperature of ∼160
°C was applied to convert the perovskite precursor solution right
after it was sprayed.49 In addition, 5
min atmospheric-pressure Ar/O2 plasma treatment under an
almost room temperature environment (<50 °C) has been used
for converting the spin-coated SnCl2 precursor into an
SnO2 film that was then used as the ETL of an n–i–p
PSC with a PCE of 19.56%.50 APPs were also
used for cleaning transparent conducting oxide glass substrates and
performing surface modifications of the ETL, HTL, and perovskite layer
of PSCs.43−45,51−53

Previously, our research team has applied atmospheric-pressure
surface-diffusion DBD (SDDBD) for the material modification of MAPbI3 used as the absorbing layer of p–i–n and n–i–p
planar PSCs. Proper SDDBD treatment time can enhance the PSC performance,
owing to the grain growth of MAPbI3 and slight PbI2 precipitation after SDDBD treatment.43,45 In these studies, the SDDBD device, a portable plasma generator,
was placed inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox to perform the plasma
treatment, as illustrated in our previous publication.44 Surface diffusion-type APP without a proper
cooling mechanism is slightly disadvantageous from the viewpoint of
temperature control. Further, during the diffusion process, reactive
plasma species could react with gas molecules in the environment and
lose reactivity. In this study, we instead use a jet-type DBD with
two metal-ring electrodes, named DBDjet (see Supporting Information, Figure S1). High-flow rate gas flow cools the
plasma to maintain the working temperature below 40 °C (Figure 1a). This He DBDjet
is scanned over the NiO film used as the HTL of a p–i–n
PSC. The scan-mode He-DBDjet-treated NiO films are carefully characterized,
and the resultant PSC reproducibly shows improved performance.

temperature and (b) OES of He DBDjet.

2 Results and Discussion
In this study, a DBDjet with
two metal-ring electrodes is used
for scanning over a NiO surface with speeds of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 cm/s.
The higher the scan rate, the shorter is the plasma-influencing period. Figure S1 shows the DBDjet configuration. He
gas was used as the plasma gas, owing to its low breakdown voltage. Figure 1a shows the temperature
time course after igniting the plasma. The temperature increased slightly
after plasma ignition, and the steady-state working temperature was
below 40 °C. Therefore, in this study, the major effects on the
property adjustment of materials are caused mainly by reactive plasma
species without substantial heating. Figure 1b shows the optical emission spectra (OES)
of the He DBDjet when treating the NiO film. The peaks in the range
of 500–750 nm correspond to He emissions. The peaks in the
ranges of 220–270, 280–310, 310–360, and 390–430
nm correspond to CO+ (first negative system, B2Σ – X2Σ),
OH (3064 Å system, A2Σ+ – X2Π), N2 (second positive system, C3Πμ – B3Πg), and N2+ (first negative system, B2Σμ+ – X2Σg+), respectively.54−57 The He DBDjet was operated in an atmospheric environment. The plasma
jet also reacted with environmental air, resulting in emissions from
species other than He.

Figure 2 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the NiO film with/without He DBDjet
treatment. Some cracks are observed on the NiO film; these seemed
to heal by He DBDjet treatment. As the scan rate decreases, the crack
size decreases. The NiO film treated by the NiO DBDjet with a scan
speed of 0.1 cm/s was the densest; this benefited the follow-up deposition
of the perovskite layer. Figure S2 shows
the corresponding atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and roughness
values. The roughness was mainly determined by the textured fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) substrate; therefore it was not changed by the He
DBDjet treatment. Figure S3 shows the grazing
incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) results of NiO on the FTO substrate.
The sharp peaks are from the FTO glass substrate, and NiO diffraction
shows only a weak signal at around 2θ = 43–44°.

SEM images of NiO films with He DBDjet treatment.

Figure 3a–c
shows the total transmittance spectra, specular transmittance spectra,
and absorption spectra of NiO-coated FTO. After He DBDjet treatment,
both transmittances increased slightly, and the absorption decreased.
The more light the perovskite layer can absorb, the higher is the
PCE the solar cell. Therefore, higher transmittance and lower absorption
of the NiO-coated FTO are beneficial for PSCs. The overall total transmittances
were above 75% at 400–800 nm. Figure S4a,b shows the reflectance and haze spectra. Based on the absorption
data, the band gap is estimated to be ∼4.0 eV using the Tauc
plot, as shown in Figure 3d; this agrees well with a previous study.58

spectra, (b) specular transmittance spectra, (c) absorption spectra,
and (d) Tauc plot.

Figure 4 shows the
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the O 1s spectra of NiO
film with/without He DBDjet treatment, and Table 1 shows the contents of the corresponding
deconvolution peaks. The peaks at 529.2, 531.1, 530.8, 531.8, and
532.4 correspond to NiO, Ni2O3, Ni(OH)2, O–C=O, and C–O, respectively. He DBDjet treatment
at a scan rate of 0.1 cm/s increased hydrophilic O–C=O
and C–O functional groups from 3.51 to 6.48% and from 0.00
to 1.13%, respectively, and this trend is confirmed by the C 1s spectra
(Figure S5). This suggests that after DBDjet
treatment, some hydrophilic functional groups can attach on the surface
NiO to enhance its wettability.59 After
He DBDjet treatment, the hydrophobic Ni(OH)2 content decreased
from 17.78 to 15.20%, and the peak in XPS N 1s spectra was also expanded
(Figure S7). The ambient nitrogen diffused
into the quartz tube of the He DBDjet, and nitrogen-containing free
radicals were produced to react with materials.

the NiO film that is (a) as-deposited and

The band alignment of each layer
of the PSCs can influence the
open circuit voltage (Voc).60 An aligned band structure can suppress carrier
recombination at the interfaces.61 Therefore,
ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to determine
the VBM of the NiO film. The VBM of the as-deposited NiO film was
estimated to be 4.7 eV. As the He DBDjet influencing time increased
(scan rate decreased), the VBM values increased to 4.87, 4.94, and
4.95 with scan rates of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively. This agrees
with previous studies, indicating that plasma treatment deepens the
VBM of metal oxide layers.28,31,32 Because the VBM of the perovskite layer is ∼5.4 eV,62 a NiO film with deeper VBM can have better band
alignment (Figure 5).

Figure 5 UPS spectra of the NiO film with He DBDjet treatment.

Figure 6 shows
the
water contact angle results of NiO films with/without He DBDjet treatment.
Without He DBDjet treatment, the NiO film shows a higher water contact
angle of 35°, partly because of the hydrophobic Ni(OH)2, which had been used to construct superhydrophobic nanostructures.63,64 After He DBDjet treatment, the reduced Ni(OH)2 content
and increased O–C=O and C–O contents decreased
the water contact angle of the NiO film from 35 to 22°. Higher
wettability of the NiO film can improve the crystallinity of the follow-up
deposited perovskite layer and ameliorate the interface.65Figure S8 shows top-view
SEM images of the perovskite layer. Improved perovskite crystallinity
can suppress the nonradiative recombination caused by the grain boundaries.66,67

contact angle images of NiO films with He DBDjet treatment.

Figure 7a shows
the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs (reverse scan). Table 2 shows the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Figure S9 shows the forward scan J–V curves. After He DBDjet treatment, the
short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill
factor (FF), and PCE were improved. The best improvement and PCE are
seen in the PSC with NiO treated by He DBDjet at a scan rate of 0.3
cm/s; the PCE was improved from 13.63 to 14.88%. This could be attributed
to the better wettability of the NiO film that leads to better crystallinity
of the perovskite layer and, in turn, suppresses the charge recombination.
The deeper VBM after He DBDjet treatment could also lead to better
band alignment for improved PSC performance. The increased Jsc could be attributed to the higher transmittance
and lower absorption of NiO-coated FTO substrates after He DBDjet
treatment. Figures S10 and S11 show the
photovoltaic parameters of six batches of PSCs, and Table S1 lists the statistics of photovoltaic parameters.
The PCE of PSCs indeed improved reproducibly after He DBDjet treatment.
The most significant improvement was seen for a scan rate of 0.3 cm/s.
The average PCE increased from 12.62% (without He DBDjet treatment)
to 13.32% (with He DBDjet treatment at a scan rate of 0.3 cm/s).

Figure 7b shows
the Nyquist plot of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
and the inset of Figure 7b shows the equivalent circuit to analyze the data. Table S2 shows the EIS fitting parameters. R1, R2, and R3 correspond to the series resistance, charge transporting
resistance, and recombination resistance, respectively.68,69 With the He DBDjet treatment at a scan rate of 0.3 cm/s, R2 decreased from 1073 to 867 Ω; and R3 increased from 7819 to 8151 Ω. With
He DBDjet treatment to enhance wettability and to heal cracks, the
contact between the NiO film and the perovskite layer was improved;
therefore, R2 decreased, and the charge
extraction efficiency of the NiO film improved. The increased R3 can be attributed to the deeper VBM of the
NiO film that allows better band alignment and to the improved perovskite
crystallization that suppresses the nonradiative recombination.

Figure 7c shows
the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of NiO/perovskite.
A better charge extraction effectiveness can suppress carrier recombination
at the interface. Before charge recombination, the carrier was extracted
into the HTL, causing the quenching effect of the PL spectra.70,71 The steady-state PL spectra indicate that the NiO film treated by
the He DBDjet with a scan rate of 0.3 cm/s has the best carrier extraction
capability, whereas the as-deposited NiO film showed poorer carrier
extraction capability. Figure 7d shows the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra. Two recombination
mechanisms of NiO/perovskite are involved: Shockley–Hall–Read
recombination at low injection and nongeminate carrier recombination
at high injection.71 Therefore, the data
were fitted with a biexponential function, f(t) = A0 + A1·exp(−t/τ1) + A2·exp(−t/τ2). Table S3 lists the fitting parameters
for the TRPL data. Without He DBD jet treatment, the PL decay times
of NiO/perovskite were τ1 = 13.60 ns and τ2 = 84.44 ns. After He DBD jet treatment, the PL decay times
of NiO/perovskite are τ1 = 9.27 ns and τ2 = 98.18 ns (scan rate of 0.3 cm/s), τ1 =
10.89 ns and τ2 = 77.95 ns (scan rate of 0.2 cm/s),
and τ1 = 11.67 ns and τ2 = 75.88
ns (scan rate of 0.1 cm/s). The average recombination lifetime can
be estimated by the equation listed in literature.71 The average lifetime was 24.34 ns for the as-deposited
NiO film and decreased to 13.66 ns for the NiO film treated by He
DBDjet with a scan rate of 0.3 cm/s. As the scan rate decreases (plasma
influencing time increases), the lifetime decreased to 14.70 ns (scan
rate of 0.2 cm/s) and 17.16 ns (scan rate of 0.1 cm/s). This result
suggests that the He DBDjet-treated NiO can extract carriers faster
from the perovskite to the HTL. This confirms that DBDjet treatment
on NiO can indeed improve the PSC performance.

3 Conclusions
An atmospheric-pressure He DBDjet with two metal-ring electrodes
is used for treating NiO that is used for p–i–n structure
PSCs. He DBDjet treatment improves the wettability and slightly heals
cracks of sol–gel-derived NiO. The treatment also deepens the
VBM, as evidenced by UPS, to allow better band alignment between the
NiO and the perovskite layer. Steady-state PL and TRPL experiments
indicate better charge extraction efficiency of the NiO/perovskite.
The transmittance of NiO-coated FTO also increases slightly after
DBDjet treatment. An EIS experiment indicates reduced transporting
resistance and increased recombination resistance after DBDjet treatment.
All of these findings support the results of improved PSC performance
with NiO treated by a scan-mode low-temperature (<40 °C) atmospheric-pressure
He DBDjet.

4 Experimental Section
He DBDjet setup: Figure S1 shows a schematic
of He DBDjet with two-metal ring electrodes. The inner diameter of
the quartz tube was 8 mm, and the outer diameter was 10 mm. The two
electrodes were fixed outside the quartz tube and separated by a 10
mm gap. The gap between the sample and the bottom of the quartz tube
was fixed at 1 mm. The plasma emerged inside the quartz tube in space
between the two electrodes and was carried to the sample surface by
the He jet flow of 3 slm (stand liter per minute). The power electrode
was connected to a high ac voltage with a peak voltage of 10 kV and
frequency of 20 kHz. Every sample was treated by the He DBDjet 20
times with scan rates of 0.3, 0.2, or 0.1 cm/s.

4.1 PSC fabrication
The FTO glass substrate
(TEC7, ∼8 Ω/sq) was used as the substrate and sequentially
cleaned in deionized water, acetone, isopropanol, and UV–ozone
cleaner for 15 min. The NiO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving
0.5 M nickel acetate (99.998%, trace metal basis, Sigma-Aldrich) and
ethanolamine (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol and stirring overnight
at 60 °C; this was the same as that in our previous study.72 The solution was spin-coated on a FTO substrate
at 6000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 325 °C for 10 min. Then,
the NiO film was treated by the He DBDjet. Next, the sample was immediately
transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox, and the perovskite film
was deposited on the NiO film by a one-step process.44 The perovskite precursor was prepared by dissolving 1.2
mM PbI2 (99.999%, metals basis, Alfa Aesar) and CH3NH3I (MAI, 98%, Dyesol) in dimethylformamide (99.8%,
Sigma-Aldrich). After perovskite deposition, PC61BM, doped
with DMOAP, and BCP were deposited on the perovskite layer, which
served as ETL.43 Finally, 85 nm Ag with
the area of 0.09 cm2 was deposited using an e-beam evaporator
as the top electrode.

4.2 Characterization
The working temperature
of the He DBDjet was monitored by a thermography camera (FLIR, E63900).
The surface morphology of NiO and perovskite was inspected by SEM
(JOEL, JSM-7800Prime). The surface morphology was probed by AFM (Bruker,
BioScope Resolve). The crystallization was surveyed by GIXRD (Bruker,
D8 DISCOVER SSS). The transmittance and reflectance spectra were measured
by an ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV–vis–NIR)
spectrophotometer (JASCO, V-670). The surface chemical bonding status
was investigated by XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB Xi+), and the C–C bond at 284.6 eV was used as the reference
peak. The VBM level was measured by UPS (Thermo VG-Scientific/Sigma
Probe) with a sample bias of −10 V. The water contact angle
was obtained by a contact angle goniometer (Sindatek, model 100SB).
The J–V curve of the PSC
was measured using a sourcemeter (Agilent, B2902A) under illumination
of simulated AM1.5 light (ABET, Sun 2000 Solar Simulator). The electrochemical
performance was evaluated by EIS (Metrohm-Autolab, PGSTAT204). To
measure the PL and TRPL, a 450 nm laser was emitted using a pulsed
diode laser (PicoQuant, PDL 200-B), and an optical measurement system
(PSH 3G system) was mounted to detect the spectra.
