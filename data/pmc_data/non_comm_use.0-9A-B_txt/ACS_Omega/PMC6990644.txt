Indiscriminate and unregulated application
of pesticides produces
deleterious effect in various groups of organisms including humans
and the environment. To solve these issues, it has been reported that
the residue-free green nanocomposite synergistically enhances the
pesticide efficacy. In this study, ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) with a
thiamethoxam nanocomposite were synthesized and we investigated their
synergistic effect on 4th instar larvae of Spodoptera
litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). These larvae were
allowed to feed on the composite of ZnO NPs with thiamethoxam (10–90
mg/L) and thiamethoxam-impregnated castor leaves. Observations showed
an increased larval mortality (27% increased mortality), a malformation
in pupae and adults, overdue emergence, and reduced fecundity and
fertility. A significant dose-dependent variation in the biochemical
parameters such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
(TBARS) in the treated larvae was also observed. A decline of 72.42
and 33.82% in SOD and GST activity ,respectively, was observed at
higher concentration as compared to the control. On the contrary,
it enhanced the TBARS level up to 56.7%. The synthesized nanocomposite
was characterized by different biophysical techniques such as X-ray
diffraction (average crystalline size 34 nm), scanning electron microscopy,
transmission electron microscopy (average particle size 30 nm), and
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Zn–O stretching peaks
at 432 cm–1 and 503 cm–1). The
observation of the present study suggests that ZnO NPs pave the way
for developing cost-effective, eco-friendly, and capable nanomaterial
for its applications in the field of biological sciences.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The population of the
world is increasing in an exponential manner
day by day. In order to feed the increasing population, the need of
the present situation is to produce more and more food.1 The crops which provide us food were attacked
by different groups of organisms including insects, causing severe
damage to plants.2 To control these pests,
a variety of synthetic insecticides were frequently used in an indiscriminate
manner, which leads to many serious concerns in various groups of
organisms including humans.3,4

Fortunately, the
rapid development of the nanotechnology along
with alternative strategies aimed to produce residue-free nanocomposites
with increased insecticidal activity and least environmental persistence,
along with little damaging effect to human health and the environment.
Besides, the judicious application of pesticide usage can delay the
resistance development against the insecticides.5 In recent years, different nanoparticles (NPs) have been
developed, namely, Ag, CuO, MgO, and ZnO, with confirmed efficient
insecticidal activity either alone or in the combined form with different
drugs against the insects of different orders.6−8 Interestingly,
to the best of our knowledge, a few research papers have been shown
to study the combined effects of NPs with organic pesticides to control
the damage caused to plants by these insect pests.9−11

Moreover,
semiconductor NPs provide a feasible solution to remove
the residues of pesticides through photocatalytic activity12 and also encourage us to lay down a novel green
nanotechnology to control insect pests with a synergistic approach
along with successive degradation through the photocatalytic activity
and hence are environmentally friendly. Because of these properties
of NPs, the ZnO NPs were chosen in the present study as they are cheap,
stable, and sensitive to pathogens. Considering it, we predict that
thiamethoxam might bind with the Zn atoms at the ZnO crystal surface
to form a composite structure and consequently cause more damaging
effects.13 This study is devoted to investigate
the relative effect of ZnO NPs with thiamethoxam and thiamethoxam
alone on Spodoptera litura and evaluate
their enhanced insecticidal activity and low persistence in the environment.

To accomplish this, we have focused on the biological and biochemical
parameters of S. litura such as superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST),
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and “the enzymatic
antioxidants”, formed against the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and free radicals developed in insects and utilized scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy for the
characterization of ZnO NPs.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Chemicals
Thiamethoxam was purchased
from the local market (25% Wettable Granules) of the commercial grade
with the brand name “Thioxam” manufactured by Kalyani
Industries, Maharashtra, India, and all other chemicals used in the
present study were procured from the Sigma-Aldrich and were of the
analytical grade.

2.2 Synthesis of TZnO NCs
ZnO NPs were
synthesized according to the work of Shoeb et al.14 (detailed description is provided in the Supporting Information).
Thiamethoxam was added to ZnO NP (5:1 ratio) water suspension under
mild magnetic stirring at room temperature (27 °C) and the stirring
is continued for 30 min followed by aging at 27 °C for 1 h. After
aging, the reaction mixture was heated to 50 °C and it was maintained
at this temperature for 60 min. A white color precipitate formed is
washed twice with double distilled water and dried at 50 °C for
2 h in a hot air oven.

2.3 Characterization of TZnO
NCs
XRD
analysis of the as-synthesized TZnO NCs was performed in the 2θ
range of 20–80° (Rigaku Miniflex II) with Cu Kα
radiations (λ = 1.5406 Å) operating at a voltage of 30
kV15 and a current of 15 mA. For surface
morphology, as well as the size of TZnO NCs, SEM was performed (JSM67500F,
JEOL model).16 The elemental analysis was
determined using the Oxford Instruments INCAx-sight energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. TZnO NCs were characterized by TEM. The
samples were prepared by placing a drop of the reaction product over
a gold-coated negative grid, allowing the solution to evaporate. TEM
was performed on a JEOL model electron microscope. The microscope
was operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.17 For the FTIR spectroscopic measurements, the TZnO NC powder
was mixed with spectroscopic-grade potassium bromide (KBr) in the
ratio of 1:100 and the spectra were recorded in the range of wave
numbers of 400–4000 cm–1 on a PerkinElmer
FTIR Spectrum BX (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, CT, USA)
in the diffuse reflectance mode at a resolution of 4 cm–1 in KBr pellets.18

2.4 Rearing
of S. litura
The test insect S.litura adults were captured from in and around
the agricultural fields
of Faculty of Agriculture, AMU, Aligarh, India. They were kept in
the rearing jar of size (20 × 15 cm) under the laboratory conditions
of 26 ± 2 °C temperature, 65–70% relative humidity,
and a photoperiod of 14 h light:10 h dark in a B.O.D incubator. The
adults were fed on the 10% glucose solution soaked in the cotton.
For laying eggs, the jars were provided with tissue paper. The collected
eggs were kept in other jars for hatching. Throughout the larval period,
fresh castor leaves were given as larval food. From the stock culture,
fourth instar larvae of F2 generation were selected for
the present study.

2.5 Preparation of Different
Concentrations of
the Insecticide
After calculating the LC50 value,
different sublethal concentrations were prepared by dissolving it
in distilled water, viz.,10, 30, 60, and 90 mg/L (T1–T4 & ZT1–ZT4). Distilled water alone was considered
as the control.

2.6 Mode of Application of
Different Sublethal
Concentrations
The castor leaves were dipped in the different
sublethal concentrations of the insecticide and insecticide-containing
NPs for 10 min. After that, the leaves were dried at room temperature.
Thirty individuals of fourth instar larvae were chosen for each sublethal
concentration and were allowed to feed upon the treated leaves. There
were three replicates for each sub lethal concentration along with
the untreated control.

2.7 Assay of GST
GST
activity was measured
according to the method of Habig et al.19 The reaction mixture containing 10 mM GSH and 1 mM CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene)
was used as the substrate. After adding 50 μL of the protein
sample prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), the reaction initiated.
The activity of the enzyme was measured as the CNDB conjugate formed
in nmoles/min/mg protein.

2.8 Analysis of SOD Activity
To measure
the SOD activity, we followed the method of Marklund and Marklund
(1974). The reaction mixture (3 mL) contained 2.85 mL of 50 mM Tris-cacodylate
buffer (pH 8.5) and 50 μL of the sample. To initiate the reaction,
we added 100 μL of 0.13 mM pyrogallol. The absorbance was noted
at 420 nm for the period of 3 min. SOD activity of one unit is defined
as the amount of the enzyme involved in 50% inhibition of autoxidation
of pyrogallol. SOD activity was expressed in units per mg of protein.

2.9 LPO Assay
The MDA level as marker
lipid peroxidation (LPO) was performed by the method of Buege and
Aust (1978). The gut homogenate was prepared in chilled 0.1 M potassium
chloride solution. The reaction mixture contained 0.250 mL of the
gut homogenate, 1 mL of TBA, and 3 mL of OPA. After vortexing, the
reaction mixture was kept for incubation at 90 °C for 45 min.
Different aliquots were prepared, and the absorbance was calculated
at 535 nm. The rate of LPO was expressed as nanomoles of MDA formed
using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.56 × 105 M–1 cm–1 for the MDA–TBA
colored complex.

2.10 Statistical Analysis
Data of the three independent experiments were presented as mean ±
SEM. Data obtained related to oxidative stress were analyzed by two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni’s post-hoc
test using statistical software Graph Pad Prism 5.01 (CA, USA). Data
obtained related to larval mortality, fecundity, fertility, and longevity
were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s test.
The significant level is set at p < 0.05.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of TZnO
NPs
XRD
characterized the crystal structure of TZnO NCs with Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm). The data revealed ten well-resolved XRD peaks
at 2θ = 31.89, 34.65, 36.13, 47.52, 56.70, 62.89, 66.72, 68.09,
69.45, and 77.10°, which correspond to the crystal planes [100],
[002], [101], [102], [110], [103], [200], [112], [201], and [202]
of the polycrystalline wurtzite structure (zincite, JCPDS 5-0664),
respectively (Figure 1). They relate XRD peaks, at 8.60, to carbon (a different allotrope
of carbon) in thiamethoxam and the occurrence of sulphur at 16.40,
23.70, 25.70, 27.30, 32.90, and 58.70 in thiamethoxam. The XRD data
of TZnO NPs showed the successful functionalization of thiamethoxam
on ZnO nanoparticles. We found the average crystallite size to be
34 nm using the Debye–Scherrer formula.

Figure 1 XRD pattern of T ZnO
NCs.

Figure 2A–C
shows SEM images of TZnO NCs, whose sizes ranged between 5 and 0.5
μm with relatively round shapes and smooth surfaces of ZnO NPs
around the thiamethoxam insecticide. Introduction of ZnO NPs to the
thiamethoxam insecticide suspensions triggered ZnO NP adsorption on
the surface as shown in Figure 2A,B. The sizes of the functionalized ZnO NP insecticide ranged
between 5 and 0.5 μm on the scale, suggesting multilayer functionalization
of the ZnO NPs. Figure 2D reveals EDX (elemental composition) mapping which confirms the
successful functionalization of ZnO NPs over the thiamethoxam insecticide
and confirmed the presence of elements such as zinc (Zn), oxygen (O),
carbon (C), sulphur (S), and chlorine (Cl). TEM (Figure 2E,F) analyzed the effect of
the thiamethoxam insecticide on ZnO NP surface functionalization. Figure 3E,F shows two distinct
phases on the scale of 100 and 20 nm. TEM images revealed two distinct
phases (i) the light phase and (ii) the dark phase. It shows that
the light phase of the TEM image belongs to the organic phase (thiamethoxam
insecticide) and the dark phase belongs to the inorganic phase of
the NPs (ZnO NPs). In addition, it shows TEM images of interaction
between these two phases. Therefore, we can see the successful functionalization
between ZnO NPs and the thiamethoxam insecticide.

of TZnO NCs on the scale 5, 2, and 0.5
μm; (D) EDX mapping; and (E,F) TEM images of TZnO NCs on the
scale 100 and 20 nm.

Figure 3 FTIR spectrum pattern
of TZnO NCs.

The FTIR spectrum of TZnO NCs
is shown in Figure 3, and it shows two strong absorptions at
503 and 432 cm–1 in which the 432 cm–1 peak represents the tensile bond of ZnO and the 503 cm–1 peak represents oxygen vacancies in ZnO. Different absorption FTIR
peaks showed successful functionalization of the thiamethoxam insecticide.
The band which occurred at 3450 cm–1 may show the
vibration of the hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups and absorbed H2O molecules. The stretching vibration of the carbonyl peak
in the TZnO NCs at the band at 1607 cm–1 broadened.
This may suggest the formation of different carbonyl groups such as
aldehydes and carboxylic acids. The stretching band at 2089 cm–1 related to the N=C=S vibration. The
band at 1520 cm–1 was showing the weakening of N–O
stretching in thiamethoxam, C–C stretching of the phenyl ring,
and the C=N stretching for the pesticide molecule vibration.
It relates the band at 1350, 1266, and 1125 cm–1 to the stretching vibration of C–N (aromatic), C–N
(allyl), and C–O, respectively. At high frequency, vibrations
were recognized as C–N feeble stretching, C–Cl halo
compound C–Cl stretching, and monosubstituted C–H stretching
at 1027, 853, and 773 cm–1, respectively. With all
the evidence, we can confirm the functionalization of ZnO nanoparticles
with the thiamethoxam insecticide.

3.2 SOD Activity
Following the treatment
with different concentrations of thiamethoxam (T1–T4) and the ZnO–thiamethoxam composite (ZT1–ZT4), SOD activities vary in the dose- and time-dependent manner (Figure 4a,b). The SOD activities
during early exposure and at the lower concentration increase significantly
showing a preliminary stimulatory response. The SOD activity increases
during 48 h of exposure and started decreasing at 72 h of exposure.
In the highest concentrations (ZT4 and T4), the SOD activity decreases significantly, indicating the toxicity
of the pesticide. The groups treated with ZnO–thiamethoxam
showed the higher SOD activity than the groups treated with thiamethoxam
alone (Figure 4b).The
enhanced SOD activities in the groups treated with ZnO–thiamethoxam
as compared to those treated with thiamethoxam alone clearly show
the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs.

NCs on LPO. (f)Values are mean ± SEM. (n = 3).
Data showed a significant increase at *p < 0.05
vs control and a significant decrease at #p < 0.05 vs control.

3.3 GST Activity
Following the treatment
with different concentrations of thiamethoxam (T1–T4) and the ZnO–thiamethoxam composite (ZT1–ZT4), the activity of the detoxifying enzyme, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), in the gut of S. litura larvae is presented in Figure 4c,d. We observed a dose- and time-dependent increase
in the GST activity up to 48 h of exposure both in thiamethoxam (T1–T4) and the ZnO–thiamethoxam composite. However,
during 72 h of exposure, the GST activity in the highest concentration
(ZT4) decreases significantly showing the phase of transition
from active antioxidant defense to the exhausted state. In the ZnO–thiamethoxam
composite, GST activity decreases significantly as compared to the
thiamethoxam-treated groups.

3.4 LPO Assay
After
treating with different
concentrations of thiamethoxam(T1–T4) and ZnO–thiamethoxam
(ZT1–ZT4), the level of malondialdehyde (MDA)
formed as an end product of LPO is presented in Figure 4e,f. We observed a dose- and time-dependent
significant (p < 0.05) increase in the level of
MDA in all test concentrations of thiamethoxam and ZnO–thiamethoxam.
In the highest concentration (ZT4), we observed a significant
increased level of MDA as compared to the highest concentration (T4) of thiamethoxam.

3.5 Effect on Larval Mortality
Larval
mortality after treating with different concentrations of ZnO–thiamethoxam
and thiamethoxam increases in the dose-dependent manner (Figure 5a,b). We observed
the enhanced larval mortality in all test concentrations of ZnO–thiamethoxam
as compared to the groups treated with thiamethoxam alone. In the
highest concentration (ZT4), we observed 27% enhanced
mortality than the groups treated with thiamethoxam alone. These apparent
differences in the larval mortality showed the synergistic effect
of the ZnO NPs.

(a) thiamethoxam–ZnO NCs on larval mortality, (b) thiamethoxam
on adult emergence, and (c) thiamethoxam–ZnO NCs on adult emergence,
(d) Values are mean ± SEM. (n = 3). Data showed
a significant increase at *p < 0.05 vs control.

3.6 Effect on the Adult Emergence
and Malformation
Following the treatments with the different
concentrations of thiamethoxam
alone and ZnO–thiamethoxam, inhibition of adult emergence is
presented (Figure 5c,d). We observed a significant (p < 0.05) decline
in the emergence of adults in all test concentrations of thiamethoxam
alone and ZnO–thiamethoxam. Most pronounced effects are seen
in the groups treated with the different concentrations of ZnO–thiamethoxam
as compared to the groups treated with thiamethoxam alone. In the
highest concentration (ZT4) of ZnO–thiamethoxam
(percent), inhibition of adult emergence was recorded. The post molting
effects on the pupae and adults were also seen in different concentrations
(Chart 1). In the groups
treated with ZnO–thiamethoxam, the rate of malformations was
higher than that of the thiamethoxam-treated groups.

and Thiamethoxam–ZnO NCs on Malformation

Malformed Pupa.
3.7 Effect
on Fecundity and Fertility
Effect of ZnO NPs and thiamethoxam
on the fecundity and fertility
of the females was presented in Figure 6a–d. We observed a significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent decrease in the fecundity and fertility
in all the test concentrations. We observed a significant (p < 0.05) difference in the highest concentration (ZT4 and T4) of ZnO–thiamethoxam and thiamethoxam.
In the highest concentration of ZnO–thiamethoxam (ZT4), a significant decline (26.2 & 20.34%) in the fecundity and
fertility clearly showed the synergistic effects of ZnO NPs.

NCs on fertility. (d) Values are mean ± SEM. (n = 3). Data showed a significant increase at *p <
0.05 vs control.

3.8 Effects
on the Longevity
After treating
with the different concentrations (ZT4 and T4) of thiamethoxam and ZnO–thiamethoxam, we observed their
effects on the larval longevity (fifth and sixth) and adult longevity
(male and female). A significant (p < 0.05) dose-dependent
increase in the longevity of the fifth and sixth instar larvae was
observed. In the highest concentration (ZT4) of ZnO–thiamethoxam
and thiamethoxam alone, longevity of the fifth and sixth instar larvae
was enhanced by 56.28 and 52.6%, respectively, as compared to the
control (Figure 7a–d).
Interestingly, we also observed enhanced longevity of males and females
in ZnO–thiamethoxam-treated groups (Figure 8a–d), indicating the synergistic effects
of ZnO NPs.

fifth instar larvae: (a) thiamethoxam–ZnO NCs on the fifth

The problem of resistance
toward the different groups of insecticides
due to their extensive use is reported in different parts of the world.20 As a consequence, there is need to develop an
alternative approaches. Zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs derived from the metal
that has strong inclination toward the production of ROS and finally
resulted in development of oxidative stress in different groups of
the organisms including insects.21 Apart
from the resistance problem in different groups of insects, the indiscriminate
use of insecticides/pesticides leads to adverse effects on the ecosystem
in general and on the humans in particular.22 Therefore, it is the requisite of the present situation to develop
alternative methods to minimize the use of insecticides/pesticides.
The synergistic effect (ability to enhance the effects of insecticides/pesticides)
of ZnO NPs has been studied to overcome the aforementioned problem.
The current study is the first effort to explore synergistic behavior
of ZnO NPs in insects in general and S. litura in particular. To the best of our information, this is the first
time to explore the synergistic insecticidal ability of ZnO NPs with
thiamethoxam. According to the FTIR analysis (Figure 3), we demonstrated the synergistic effects
because of weak interaction between thiamethoxam and ZnO NPs. As a
result, thiamethoxam concentration increased at the sites where thiamethoxam
has more contact with the larvae of S. litura and hence causes more destruction as compared to thiamethoxam used
alone.

The infiltration of ZnO NPs might cause more ZnO-stimulated
oxidative
damage within the cell.6 However, after
formation of the ZnO–thiamethoxam composite, ZnO NPs possibly
will help thiamethoxam to enter inside the body of the larvae and
endorse to exert the thiamethoxam toxicity.

Following the treatments
with different concentrations of ZnO–thiamethoxam,
effects are recorded in terms of oxidative stress. In the lower concentrations,
the oxidative stress is probably developed as a result of ROS production
in the insect gut. The production of ROS in an excess amount causes
undesirable oxidative stress that leads to cell damage. Most of the
cells can tolerate the small elevated level of ROS, through increasing
scavenging activity of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD and GST.23 However, when ROS are produced in large quantity,
this defense system becomes weak and inactive.24

The antioxidant enzyme SOD causes dismutation of
O2– to H2O2, whereas GST induces
a reaction in
which xenobiotics are converted to (GSH) reduced glutathione.25−27 Both SOD and GST with the help of other antioxidants play an important
protective role against the attack of ROS. However, when the larvae
of S. litura were treated with the
highest concentration of ZnO–thiamethoxam, this protective
system of SOD and GST appeared to be inactivated and we recorded a
significant decline in the activity possibly because of high toxicity
of thiamethoxam. The activity of SOD and GST in the ZnO–thiamethoxam
at the highest concentration and at 72 h declined significantly. This
decline in SOD and GST activity might be due to the synergistic effects
of ZnO NPs, which lead to increased efficiency of the pesticide thiamethoxam.
The studies of other workers also confirmed the synergistic behaviors
of ZnO NPs.28

The oxidative stress
induced due to NPs also targets the lipids
and instigates LPO. The highest concentration of ZnO–thiamethoxam
and thiamethoxam resulted in sufficient oxidative stress that causes
LPO. The increased levels of ROS within the cells, after exposure
to the NPs perhaps not only influence the membrane potential and permeability
but also influence the mitochondrial function as well.29 Such changes inhibit the ATP production by disrupting
the electron transport system,30 ultimately
causing death of the insects. We observed the increased level of MDA
after exposure to the highest concentration of the ZnO–thiamethoxam
composite as compared to the same concentration of thiamethoxam alone.
This increased MDA level might be due to the synergistic effect of
ZnO NPs, which enhanced the toxicity of thiamethoxam.

The effects
of thiamethoxam alone and the ZnO–thiamethoxam
composite were also evaluated on the different biological parameters,
such as mortality, fecundity, fertility, malformation, and longevity.
We observed a dose-dependent significant increase in the abovementioned
parameters. In the integrated pest management program, insect pest
mortality has been considered as an important parameter.31,32 Maximum mortality followed by minimum use of pesticides is considered
to be an appropriate approach for reducing pollution in an ecosystem.33 ZnO–thiamethoxam at its higher concentration
caused the highest mortality as compared to when thiamethoxam is used
alone. This might be due to synergistic effect of the NPs.

Fecundity
and fertility of the insect pest determined the population
level in a particular area.34 It is considered
as an indirect method of controlling the population of insect pests
after exposure to different groups of insecticides, instead of killing
the adult insects. It would be greatly beneficial from the ecological
point of view to control the insect pest population through reducing
the egg-laying capacity of females and its emergence.4 In the present study, maximum reduction of fecundity and
fertility was observed in the ZnO–thiamethoxam-treated groups
as compared to when thiamethoxam was used alone.

Longevity is
considered as an important aspect in the life cycle
of insect pests. They maintain their population size through maintaining
longevity of different stages. After exposure to insecticides, the
longevities of larvae and adults get disturbed, which leads to reduced
population of insect pests.35 In the present
study, the longevity of the larvae and adults increases significantly
in the dose-dependent manner. The maximum increased longevity was
observed in the ZnO–thiamethoxam groups as compared to when
thiamethoxam was used alone possibly because of the synergistic behavior
of NPs used in the present study. Inducing malformation in the insect
pest population in the integrated pest management program is also
considered as one of the important aspects in controlling pest population
below the economic injury level.36,37 In the present
study, the malformation was observed to increase in the dose-dependant
manner. However, at the highest concentration in the ZnO–thiamethoxam group,
the highest number of malformed adults was found as compared to when
thiamethoxam was used alone. This observed effect might be due the
synergistic effect of the ZnO NPs used in the present study. In the
highest concentration of ZnO–thiamethoxam groups, we observed
the enhanced effects as compared to the groups treated with thiamethoxam
alone. These enhanced effects might be due to synergistic effects
of ZnO NPs.

4 Conclusions
The
findings of the present study suggested that ZnO–thiamethoxam
NPs were used to control the population of S. litura. We speculated that the formation of the ZnO–thiamethoxam
composite insecticide system, electrostatic adsorption of ZnO–thiamethoxam
groups to insect cells, and the cellular internalization ZnO NPs played
important roles in synergistic insecticidal activities which facilitate
the interaction of ZnO NPs, thiamethoxam, and their combination with
different components of cells of S. litura leading to enormous damage.

As a result, the antioxidant competency
of S. litura was debilitated and led
to more destruction in ZnO-induced oxidative
stress; finally, the synergistic insecticidal activity was attained
against S. litura. Owing to the synergistic
insecticidal activity, this nanotechnology first offers the prospect
to moderate thiamethoxam usage in the presence of ZnO NPs devoid of
compromise in insect control. Hence, we have observed increased alterations
in biological parameters and oxidative stress markers in thiamethoxam-containing
zinc oxide NPs as compared to groups treated with thiamethoxam alone.
The present study demonstrated prominent effects of nanotechnology;
however, further work still needs to be done for further deeper understanding
the synergistic mechanism and extending the application range with
other groups of pesticides.
