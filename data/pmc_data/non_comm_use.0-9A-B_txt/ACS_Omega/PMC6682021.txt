Hydrogen is a promising
clean energy source and an important chemical raw material. To use
hydrogen energy more safely, a high-pressure hydrogen-release platform
for hydrogen self-ignition and for generating hydrogen jet flames
under different experimental conditions was investigated in this study.
The associated experimental analysis was based on the theory of high-pressure
hydrogen tube diffusion. We found that the higher the initial release
pressure, the greater the intensity of the leading shock. When the
initial release pressure was high and the leading shock intensity
was strong, hydrogen was more likely to ignite spontaneously inside
the tube. The higher the initial release pressure, the faster the
average propagation speed of the shock in the same pipe length. The
time during which a stable leading shock was formed inside the tube
may be related to the initial release pressure. It was found that
flame combustion intensified after the passage of air through a Mach
disk, and a stable flame was formed more easily at the jet boundary
layer away from the orifice axis. The maximum speed of the flame tip
and the flame decay speed were very high. Moreover, the flame length
and the diameter of the ball flame first increased and then decreased.

1 Introduction
Hydrogen has a high calorific value of combustion, and it is one
of the most important clean energy sources. Many developed countries
believe that it is necessary to develop hydrogen fuel cells and the
hydrogen industry.1 However, the minimum
ignition energy of hydrogen (0.017 mJ) is extremely low, and its spark
ignition energy of explosion is approximately 0.006 J.2 Moreover, the limit of hydrogen combustion is very wide,
ranging from 4 to 75%. Hydrogen is stored primarily under high pressure.
High-pressure hydrogen can easily cause a fire and explode in the
event of a leak.3 Therefore, the safety
of hydrogen is a major challenge from the viewpoint of promoting its
widespread use.

In a leak, high-pressure hydrogen is released
into air through a downstream pipeline, and a shockwave is formed
at the front of the hydrogen jet. The high temperature generated by
the shockwave and the multidimensional shock structure can heat the
air in the area through which the shockwave passes. Subsequently,
a mixed layer is formed by the hydrogen jet and the aforementioned
high-temperature air. When the hydrogen concentration of the layer
is in the ignition range and the high temperature of air reaches the
hydrogen self-ignition temperature, hydrogen ignites spontaneously
according to the diffusion ignition theory of high-pressure hydrogen
self-ignition. Duan et al.4 found that
the higher the pressure of hydrogen release, the more intense the
resulting shockwave and the easier the spontaneous ignition of hydrogen.
Grune et al.5 studied the spontaneous ignition
of leaking high-pressure hydrogen by using transparent circular pipes
and schlieren technology. They found that a multidimensional reflection
shockwave structure developed between the front of the hydrogen jet
and the front shockwave. Duan et al.,4 Lee
et al.,6 and Mogi et al.7 have expressed the same viewpoint in their papers regarding
the relationship between the pipe length and hydrogen self-ignition;
that is, as the pipe length increases, the possibility of hydrogen
self-ignition increases, and the minimum release pressure of hydrogen
self-ignition decreases. Frederick et al.8 determined that the necessary conditions for hydrogen self-ignition
are the presence of a combustible mixture of air and hydrogen inside
a pipe and the heating of the mixture by the shockwave to reach the
hydrogen self-ignition point. This implies that spontaneous ignition
of hydrogen is difficult in the absence of a pipeline. Kitabayashi
et al.9 studied the spontaneous ignition
of high-pressure hydrogen venting from pipes of different lengths.
They found that the initial release pressure at which high-pressure
hydrogen self-ignites can increase when the pipe length exceeds 1.2
m.

Kaneko et al.10 used a rupture
disk to release high-pressure hydrogen into a pipeline and a transparent
window at the end of the pipeline to observe the blasting of the rupture
disk. They proposed that the blasting process was the main cause of
hydrogen self-ignition. In another study, Kaneko et al.11 used a transparent downstream pipe to observe
hydrogen self-ignition inside the pipe. In this experiment, they found
that hydrogen self-ignition depends heavily on the intensity of the
shockwave generated as a result of breakage of the diaphragm. Erez
et al.12 considered that the contact surface
may be created because of the sudden release of high-pressure hydrogen
and air after breakage of the rupture disk, and turbulence is formed
on the contact surface to promote the mixing of hydrogen and air.
This provides favorable conditions for the spontaneous ignition of
hydrogen.

Studer et al.13 conducted
large-scale experiments to measure experimental parameters, such as
the length of the jet flame, heat radiation flux, and overpressure
after hydrogen evolution. Mogi et al.14 found that the location of hydrogen self-ignition inside the pipe
was closer to the diaphragm at higher blasting pressures. Moreover,
they observed changes in the flame shape at the nozzle by using a
high-speed camera. Duan et al.15 employed
a protective box at the nozzle to observe the flame shape and applied
the schlieren technique to observe typical pressure wave structures,
such as the Mach disk structure at the nozzle. Mogi et al.14 and Duan et al.15 have studied the evolution of the flame morphology at the nozzle,
but these researchers have not conducted in-depth research on the
flame morphology, such as the length, width, and speed of the jet
flame, associated with the spray of a high-pressure hydrogen flame
into large spaces.

The experiment of Kitabayashi et al.9 lacked direct data on the development of shock
and flame inside the tube. To grasp the attenuation process of the
shock wave and the development process of the flame inside the tube,
this paper discusses experimental research in this area. In this experiment,
photoelectric sensors were installed at different locations of the
tube to monitor the position of hydrogen spontaneous combustion inside
the tube. High-pressure hydrogen is released by pressurization to
make the rupture disk naturally rupture, which is more similar to
the sudden release of high-pressure hydrogen in reality. The main
research objectives of the present work are as follows:

Experimental
analysis based on measurement data obtained using pressure sensors,
photoelectric sensors, and diffusion theory of spontaneous hydrogen
ignition inside a tube;

Experimental study of morphological
changes in the external jet flame formed by hydrogen self-ignition
inside the tube;

Experimental investigation of hydrogen self-ignition
inside the tube and the resulting jet flame outside the tube under
different pipe lengths and different initial release pressures.

2 Experimental Setup
The present experimental study was based on an experimental high-pressure
hydrogen release platform, and the schematic of the experimental device
is shown in Figure 1. This experimental platform was composed mainly of a cylinder group,
a high-pressure storage tank, a holder with a rupture disk, high-pressure
discharge tubes, a vacuum pump system, and pressure and photoelectric
measurement systems. The high-pressure storage tank included one hydrogen
cylinder and one nitrogen cylinder. Hydrogen (99.999%) was the experimental
gas. Nitrogen (99.999%) was the test gas in the early experimental
stage, and it was used mainly to conduct an airtightness test before
the experiment and to purge tanks and tubes after the experiment.
The hydrogen tank, emptying tube, and other steel devices were made
of 316L stainless steel. The pressure capacity of all devices comprising
the experimental setup was 30 MPa.

(7) position of installed rupture disk; (8) sensor locations; (9)
nozzle; (10) storage tank; (11) control cabinet; (12) release tube;
and (13) rupture disk.

The pressure sensors and
photoelectric sensors were installed symmetrically. Each long tube
comprised three short tubes of equal length that were connected using
the inbuilt thread structure (see Figure 2), and the inner diameter of the tubes was
10 mm. The sensors were installed at four locations on the long tube;
P1–P4 were pressure sensors (PCB-113B22), and L1–L4
were photoelectric sensors (Thorlabs FDS-010). An oscilloscope (Agilent-N9003A)
and a Keysight high-speed acquisition card (U2531) were used to acquire
data from the pressure sensor and the photoelectric sensor, respectively.
The natural blasting method was applied to the rupture disk to release
hydrogen. The rupture disk was embedded with a “cross”
that served as a weakening groove; this structure of the rupture disk
produced the least debris during blasting. The evolution of the spontaneous
ignition of high-pressure hydrogen to form a jet flame was studied
under different initial release pressures and pipe lengths. The lengths
of the experimental tubes were 300, 700, 1200, 1700, and 2200 mm (namely,
3T + 65 mm + 55 mm in Figure 2). The pressure gauge was an industrial pressure gauge, and
the accuracy was 0.01 MPa. The degree of vacuum during the experiment
is about −1.0 atm. In the experiment, the inlet hydrogen flow
rate to the main body container is about 0.6 m3/min.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Experimental Analysis Based
on the Hydrogen Self-Ignition Diffusion Theory
Figure 3 shows a schematic of the theory
of high-pressure hydrogen diffusion inside a tube. The high-pressure
chamber inside the tube is filled with high-pressure hydrogen to form
the high-pressure zone, that is, zone 4. The low-pressure chamber
communicates with the atmospheric environment, and this low-pressure
zone is formed by air at atmospheric pressure, that is, zone 1. When
the rupture disk blasts suddenly, the sudden release of high-pressure
hydrogen from the high-pressure zone forms the leading shock. Because
of the turbulent action of the high-speed airflow and the expansion
and divergence of the hydrogen jet, the high-pressure hydrogen behind
the leading shock mixes with the air in the low-pressure zone downstream
of the pipe. A contact surface with the mixed zone is formed in front
of the hydrogen jet. The hydrogen–air mixed zone between the
leading shock and the contact surface is zone 2. When the initial
release pressure is high, the warming effect due to mutual interference
of the shockwave compression and the friction between the high-speed
airflow and the pipe can increase the temperature in the hydrogen–air
mixed zone. When
the temperature in the pipe increases and reaches the hydrogen self-ignition
temperature and the hydrogen concentration is in the ignition range,
hydrogen is ignited after the ignition delay period. The area from
the rupture disk to the contact surface is the hydrogen jet zone (i.e.,
zone 3), and the compressed hydrogen jet is in a state of rapid outward
expansion.

diagram of high-pressure hydrogen
diffusion inside a tube.

Figure 4 shows a graph of the relationship between the initial release pressure
and the intensity of the leading shock. The intensity was derived
from the stable leading shock detected by the pressure sensors. Xu
et al.16 found that a stable leading shock
is formed when the propagation distance (distance from the rupture
disk) is 5D (D is the diameter of
the tube). In the current experiment, the pipe diameter was 10 mm,
and the pressure sensor P1 was 65 mm away from the rupture disk. However,
we found that the pressure sensor P1 could be used to monitor the
stable leading shock in most cases. In some experiments, the stable
leading shock must be measured at pressure sensor P2 (detailed description
in Figures 5 and 6). By comparing Figures 5b and 6b, the formation
of the stable leading shock was related to the initial release pressure. Figure 4 shows that the greater
the initial release pressure, the greater the intensity of the leading
shock, and the intensity is distributed above and below the fitting
curve.

Figure 4 Relationship between the initial release pressure and
the intensity of the leading shock.

Figure 5 Tube length 300 mm (initial
release pressure 4.14 MPa
and average speeds of the shock wave 870, 882, and 857 m/s; initial
release pressure 7.08 MPa and average speeds of the shock wave 1224,
1304, and 1395 m/s).

Figure 6 Tube length 700 mm (initial release pressure 5.12 MPa
and average
speeds of the shock wave 1041, 1007, and 939 m/s; initial release
pressure 9.04 MPa and average speeds of the shock wave 1254, 1362,
and 1298 m/s).

Figure 5 shows the different experimental conditions tested under a tube
length of 300 mm. Figure 6 shows the various experimental conditions tested under a
tube length of 700 mm. In Figure 5, for the tube length of 300 mm and an initial release
pressure of 4.14 MPa, the stable leading shock could be observed at
sensor P1. The initial release pressure was 7.08 MPa, and the stable
leading shock could be observed at sensor P2. The leading shock was
a strong compression wave, and a series of weak compression waves
were superimposed to form the leading shock. Therefore, the formation
of the leading shock was a gradual process. During the initial release
of high-pressure hydrogen, new compression waves were generated continuously
because of the multistep rupture behavior of the rupture disk. When
the rupture disk was broken completely, no new compression waves were
generated. Thereafter, the intensity of the leading shock remained
stable during its propagation. In Figure 6, the maximum leading shock was detected
at P2. However,
the intensity of the leading shock was unstable. The mutual interference
of the shockwave in the propagation process increased the intensity
of the leading shock, and energy dissipation because of fluid viscosity
and wall friction reduced the intensity of the leading shock (comparing
P1 with P4 under one condition). Therefore, the leading shock was
relatively stable under the combined action of the reinforcing effect
and the weakening effect. Moreover, Figure 5 shows that the average speed of the shockwave
under the initial release pressure of 7.08 MPa was significantly higher
than the average speed of the shockwave under the initial release
pressure of 4.14 MPa.

In Figure 6b, L2 (photoelectric sensor) first received the photoelectric
signal, which shows that the ignition position was between L1 and
L2 inside the tube. By comparing the photoelectric signal with the
pressure signal, it was found that the leading shock should be in
front of the ignition position. Moreover, the interval between the
leading shock signal and the photoelectric signal was lengthened gradually,
indicating that the mixed zone (zone 2 in Figure 1) enlarged gradually. Kaneko et al.11 found that the self-ignition of hydrogen inside
the transparent tube produced a cylindrical flame, and the flame gradually
became longer when it propagated downstream. After the rupture disk
was broken, the front of the hydrogen jet could form the hydrogen–air
mixed zone, and a high-temperature environment could ignite the hydrogen–air
mixture. Thereafter, the high-speed hydrogen jet drove the ignited
hydrogen and mixed zone toward the tube nozzle. Moreover, the ignited
hydrogen–air mixture gradually expanded in the mixed zone.

According to Table 1, when the initial release pressure was low under the same tube length,
hydrogen did not ignite spontaneously. Hydrogen self-ignited only
after the initial release pressure exceeded a certain threshold. Expansion
cooling of the hydrogen jet led to the formation of the hydrogen–air
mixed zone (zone 2 in Figure 3) with a temperature that was below the autoignition temperature.
This is the main reason that the hydrogen was not ignited easily when
the initial release pressure was low. As the initial release pressure
increased, the intensity of the leading shock increased and the flow
in the hydrogen–air mixed zone (zone 2 in Figure 3) and the hydrogen jet zone
(zone 3 in Figure 3) enhanced. Moreover, hydrogen and air mixed more intensely at the
contact surface, and shock compression and friction heat generation
enhanced, which would eventually promote the self-ignition of hydrogen.

Figures 7 and 8 show the relationship of the initial release pressure
with the intensity of the leading shock and the average speed of the
shockwave under different experimental conditions. Figures 7 and 8 show that the greater the initial release pressure for the same
tube length, the greater the intensity of the leading shock and the
higher the average shock speed. Figures 7b and 8b show that
the average speed of the shockwave decreases gradually under the same
initial release pressure. This experimental phenomenon was more obvious
in the longer tube (compared with Figures 5 and 6) because the
shockwave underwent energy dissipation because of fluid viscosity
and wall friction during propagation.17

3.2 Evolution of a
Self-Ignition Flame Projecting out of the Tube
Figure 9 shows the flame from the nozzle
under different experimental conditions. When the shockwave and the
hydrogen jet left the release tube and entered the atmosphere, a complex
flow field structure was formed outside the tube. After the leading
shockwave passed, the air density increased and the pressure in this
area significantly increased. As the high-pressure hydrogen jet entered
the atmosphere, it started expanding rapidly. The underexpanded jet
developed outward in a supersonic manner at the nozzle. Because the
compressed gas had a higher speed at the beginning, which is a momentum-controlled
flow, the hydrogen jet propagated substantially along the axial centerline
of the tube outlet. Moreover, many expansion waves were generated
in the underexpanded jet. The expanding waves propagated outside the
jet, and when they encountered the jet boundary layer, they were reflected
as compressed waves. The compression waves formed by the reflection
propagated toward the inside of the jet and eventually accumulated
into a barrel shock in the jet. As the flow continued to develop,
shockwaves gradually transformed into a Mach disk. When the barrel
shock interacted with the Mach disk, a reflected wave was formed.
When airflow passed through the Mach disc, the airflow speed decreased.
Therefore, according to the energy conservation law, the temperature
of airflow must increase. In Figure 9, when the airflow passed through the Mach disk, the
bundle area behind the Mach disk was brighter, indicating that the
hydrogen burned more intensely. Thereafter, the flame gradually developed
into a slug flame, and, finally, the jet flame was formed. This result
is consistent with the experimental results obtained by Kitabayashi
et al.9 and Kessler et al.18 A special flame development process was found in these
experiments, as detailed in Figure 11.

Figure 9 Flame at the
nozzle: (a) tube length 700 mm and release pressure 7.08 MPa; (b)
tube length 1200 mm and release pressure 6.12 MPa; and (c) tube length
2200 mm and release pressure 7.86 MPa.

Figure 10 shows the average speed of the flame tip versus time.
In this figure, the average speed of the flame tip decreased gradually
with time. In the first 50 ms, the average speed of the flame tip
decreased at a faster rate; thereafter, the average speed decreased
slowly. In the initial stages of the high-pressure hydrogen jet flame,
the initial propagation speed of the flame tip was high because of
the high release pressure. From the figure, it can be seen that the
initial propagation speed measured at the flame tip is 45–50
m/s. Then, as the flame outside the tube develops, the speed gradually
decreases to 0 m/s because of air resistance.

Figure 10 Average speed of the
flame tip under different experimental
conditions.

In the experiment
conducted in this study, we used a high-speed camera to record the
development of the self-ignition flame projection out of the tube.
The frame rate of the high-speed camera was 50 000 fps. Figure 11 shows the flame transition process in the nozzle for the
tube length of 2200 mm and an initial release pressure of 9.21 MPa.
The time at which the high-speed camera initially captured the flame
was set to t0. When t = 0 μs
in the figure, the self-ignition flame inside the tube was ejected
from the nozzle into the external space. Because the high-pressure
hydrogen jet started to expand, the flame diameter was greater than
the nozzle diameter, and the flame exhibited a fragmented shape. When
the flame propagated downstream, the flame surface was broken further.
When the hydrogen jet was diffused, the velocity in the central region
of the jet was higher and the velocity away from the axis was lower
because of the action of the boundary layer. Therefore, at t = 40 μs, the flame in the axial region was farther
away from the nozzle than the flame at the boundary layer. Because
the airflow velocity along the axis was higher, it was difficult for
the flame to develop stably. Therefore, at t = 60
μs, the flame fragments were blown out at the axis. The airflow
velocity at the boundary layer decreased, and the flame stabilized
gradually. Because the boundary layer was far from the axis, the interface
between the air and the hydrogen jet formed a premixed gas, which
provided a sufficient amount of combustible hydrogen–oxygen
mixture for the stable flame. As a result, the flame developed rapidly
(see flame image at t = 260 μs). Subsequently,
the flame spread further in the longitudinal direction and at the
nozzle, eventually forming the flame at t = 460 μs.

length 2200 mm and initial release pressure 9.21 MPa.

Figure 12 shows
the development of the out-of-tube flame for the tube length of 2200
mm and an initial release pressure of 9.21 MPa. An out-of-tube flame
development map was constructed using the flame image data collected
using the digital camera, and the time at which the columnar flame
appeared at the nozzle was set to t = 0 ms. At the
beginning of flame formation, the flame inside the tube formed a lumpy
flame at the nozzle. Thereafter, the flame developed rapidly. As the
high-pressure hydrogen was injected continuously, a bright burning
zone was formed. The bright burning zone developed gradually into
a ball flame because of jet expansion and divergence, and it moved
downstream continuously. At the beginning of the formation of the
high-pressure hydrogen gas-spraying flame, the initial release pressure
was relatively high, and the jet flame was a momentum-controlled horizontal
jet flame.13 As the pressure inside the
tank continued to decrease, the flame jet weakened. The ball flame
kept moving away from the nozzle, and its connection with the jet
zone weakened gradually. Then, the ball flame weakened gradually,
and the residual flame continued to move downstream for a distance,
after which it disappeared. In the later stage of flame development,
the flame was controlled by momentum–buoyancy. Finally, the
hydrogen inside the tank was exhausted, and the jet flame extinguished
gradually. Figure 12 shows that the flame length and width increase first and decrease
thereafter.

3.3 Experimental
Data of the Self-Ignition Flame Projecting out of the Tube
Table 2 presents experimental
results pertaining to the self-ignition flame projecting out of tubes
of different lengths under different initial release pressures. The
maximum shock speed was determined as the average speed of the shockwave
inside the pipe between two adjacent pressure sensors. According to
the experimental statistics, for the same pipe length, the higher
the initial release pressure, the faster the average shockwave propagation
speed and the larger the diameter of the ball flame. When the tube
length was 1700 mm, the self-ignition position of the hydrogen inside
the tube under an initial pressure of 5.79 MPa was closer to the rupture
disk when compared with that at an initial release pressure of 3.70
MPa. The diameter of the ball flame did not appear to be regular for
different pipe lengths.

4 Conclusions
In this study, an experiment was conducted
to investigate the characteristics of spontaneous ignition and the
extra-tube flame in high-pressure hydrogen tubes by changing the tube
length and the initial release pressure. The sudden release of high-pressure
hydrogen led to the formation of a leading shock, and the intensity
of the leading shock was positively correlated to the initial release
pressure. The minimum intensity of the leading shock of hydrogen self-ignition
inside the tube was approximately 1.0 MPa (conditions: tube length
1700 mm; initial release pressure 3.70 MPa). A comparison of the results
obtained under the experimental conditions with tube lengths of 300
and 700 mm showed that the position of the stable leading shock inside
the tube was not certain, which might be related to the initial release
pressure. In addition, the results obtained under the experimental
conditions with tube lengths of 1200 and 2200 mm were compared. The
higher the initial release pressure, the faster the average propagation
speed of the shockwave. The average shockwave speed decreased gradually
because of energy dissipation during downstream propagation. Through
high-speed imaging, the flame at the axial position of the nozzle
was more likely to be extinguished, and the flame brought to the boundary
layer by the vortex was more likely to develop stably. Thereafter,
the flame of the boundary layer could ignite the combustible hydrogen–air
mixture to form a stable combustion zone. By using a digital camera,
it was found that the combustion zone was pushed by the high-pressure
and high-speed airflow to form a spherical flame, and the speed of
the flame tip reached 76.51 m/s. By reviewing the effective experimental
data, it was found that the higher the initial release pressure, the
faster the average shock propagation speed, the longer the flame length,
and the greater the ball flame diameter. However, there was no obvious
change in the flame experimental data for different tube lengths.
