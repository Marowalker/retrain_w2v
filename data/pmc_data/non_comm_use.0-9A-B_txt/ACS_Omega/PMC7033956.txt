How
the methyl torsion transition energy in unsaturated systems
is affected by its environment is investigated. It is strongly influenced
by both its immediate neighborhood, (the number of methyl groups present
in the molecule) and the intermolecular interactions. It is clear
that the intermolecular interactions have a major influence on the
torsion transition energy, as demonstrated unambiguously previously
for mesitylene and also seen here for other systems. In part, this
may be caused by the fact that the methyl torsion is rarely a pure
mode (unless enforced by symmetry). Where the crystal structure is
available, the assignments have been supported by CASTEP calculations
of the unit cell. The agreement between the observed and calculated
spectra is generally good, although not perfect, toluene being a case
in point, and highlights just how demanding it is to obtain accurate
transition energies for low energy modes. The disagreement between
observed and calculated inelastic neutron scattering spectra for meta-xylene and 9,10 dimethylanthracene is so severe that
it would suggest that there are additional phases to those presently
known. Comparison between the full periodic calculations and those
for the isolated molecule shows that intermolecular interactions raise
the methyl torsion transition energy by at least 8% and in some
cases by more than 50%. The presence of more than one methyl group
in the molecule generally raises the average torsion energy from the
<100 cm–1 seen for single methyl groups to 150–200
cm–1.

Introduction
Methyl groups are ubiquitous
in organic molecules. Consequently,
their vibrational spectra have been studied since the early days of
infrared spectroscopy.1 In a CH3–X (X = nonlinear polyatomic moiety) system, there will be
nine modes associated with the three hydrogen atoms of the methyl
group: three C–H stretches at ∼3000 cm–1, three C–H bends at ∼1400 cm–1,
two rocking modes at 700–1000 cm–1, and a
torsion at low energy. With the exception of the torsion, all of these
have been extensively investigated, resulting in the well-known correlation
tables.2−4

The methyl torsion has been much less studied.
This arises because
the vibration is at low energy, always ≤400 cm–1 and generally ≤250 cm–1; a region that
is, historically, not readily accessible by infrared or Raman spectroscopy:
thus conventional infrared spectrometers cutoff at 400 cm–1. The second reason is more fundamental, the vibration is often forbidden
by optical, that is symmetry-based, selection rules or has very low
intensity. The only technique that is readily able to observe the
methyl torsion is inelastic neutron scattering (INS) spectroscopy,5 so much so that the methyl torsion is often the
strongest band in the spectrum. This arises because of several reasons:
neutrons are scattered by nuclei, not electrons, so there are no selection
rules, the intensity is determined by the scattering cross section
of the atom, of which 1H has the largest magnitude and
the amplitude of vibration, which is large for the methyl torsion.
This has enabled comprehensive studies of the in-plane6,7 and out-of-plane8 C–C–C
bending modes of the n-alkanes (the longitudinal
and transverse acoustic modes, LAM and TAM, respectively), the latter
of which includes the methyl torsion. It is found at: 289 cm–1 for ethane, 233/277 cm–1 for propane, 234/265
cm–1 for butane, 244/257 cm–1 for
hexane, and 250 ± 5 cm–1 for n ≥ 11.5,7,8 In
the longer n-alkanes the coupling between the ends
of the molecule is essentially zero and the in-phase and out-of-phase
torsions are accidently degenerate, so only a single mode is seen.

In contrast to the n-alkanes, for other systems
the effect of the environment on the transition energy of the methyl
torsion has been much less explored. In this paper, we characterized
the methyl torsion in a range of cyclic and polycyclic unsaturated
compounds. In particular, we present the INS spectra of all 13 methylated
benzenes: C6H6–x(CH3)x (x = 0–6).

Results
and Discussion
We have measured the INS spectra of all the
possible methylated
benzenes, some polycyclic aromatic compounds and some cyclic C5 and C6 alkenes. The spectra in the region below
600 cm–1, where the methyl torsions are expected,
are shown in Figures 1–4. The spectra for the 0–1800 cm–1 range are presented in the Supporting Information, Figures S1–S24.

The INS spectra of most compounds have been reported previously:
benzene,9 toluene,10,11m- and p-xylene,11,12 mesitylene,13 durene,14 pentamethylbenzene,15 and hexamethylbenzene,16 however, these are generally either (or both)
of a much lower resolution and/or restricted energy transfer range
than those reported here.

In benzene, all of the external (lattice)
modes occur at ≤150
cm–1 and this appears to be the case for all the
isomeric methylated benzenes.9 Thus, modes
above this energy must be related to the presence of the methyl group;
note that in addition to the torsion, in-plane and out-of-plane (with
respect to the aromatic ring) bending modes of the methyl group will
also occur below 600 cm–1. (These are not the C–C–H
bending modes which occur around 1400 cm–1, but
C–C–Me, where the methyl (=Me) group behaves
approximately as a point mass).

On the assumption that the strongest
features in the spectra are
the methyl torsion(s), inspection of Figures 1–4 allows some
patterns to be detected. In particular, for the methylated benzenes,
molecules that have methyl groups that are not adjacent to another
methyl group: toluene, m- and p-xylene,
and mesitylene, exhibit torsions at notably lower energy than those
with adjacent methyl groups. Typically, nonadjacent methyls are at
≤100 cm–1, while adjacent methyls are at
150–200 cm–1. It is also apparent that there
are modes that approach the methyl torsion in intensity, this is particularly
the case for the tri- and tetramethylbenzenes.

To better understand
these systems requires computational studies.
As all the molecules are uncharged and have either zero or near-zero
dipole moment, it follows that in the solid state, the dominant interactions
are van der Waals forces. In these circumstances, it would be expected
that isolated (i.e., gas phase) molecule calculations should provide
a good description of the system. We have investigated hexamethylbenzene
to test this idea.

Hexamethylbenzene was chosen because it is
the only structure for
which there is only one molecule in the primitive unit cell.21Figure 5 compares the experimental spectrum with that calculated for
the isolated molecule, the solid at the Γ-point and across the
entire Brillouin zone, both with and without the Tkatchenko and Scheffler
(TS) dispersion correction. From the top part of Figure 5, it can be seen that all the
calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental spectrum, Figure 5f. However, inspection
of the methyl torsion region, lower part of Figure 5, shows striking differences between the
calculations. In particular, contrary to the expectation, the isolated
molecule calculation, Figure 5a, shows very poor agreement in this region. The periodic
calculations do better, but here there are marked differences between
the Γ-point only and the complete Brillouin zone calculations:
compare Figure 5b,c
and 5d,e.

Figure 5 Comparison of observed and DFT calculated
INS spectra of hexamethylbenzene.
Top: 0–1800 cm–1 and lower: expanded view
of the region containing the methyl torsions. (a) Isolated molecule
(Gaussian), periodic-DFT (CASTEP) without the TS correction (b) at
the Γ-point only, (c) for the complete Brillouin zone, periodic-DFT
(CASTEP) with the TS correction (d) at the Γ-point only, and
(e) for the complete Brillouin zone, (f) experimental spectrum.

The differences are evidence for significant vibrational
dispersion
(variation of transition energy with wavevector) in the system, as
can be seen from the dispersion curves shown in Figure 6. Because INS is sensitive to all wavevectors
and not just at the Γ-point as for infrared and Raman spectroscopy,
the vibrational dispersion is directly reflected in the spectrum.
The dispersion curves for the modes above 300 cm–1 are essentially flat and are shown in Figure S5. The dispersion arises from interactions between molecules
in neighboring cells and, for nonpolar systems such as those discussed
here, this is mediated by dispersion (i.e. van der Waals) forces and
this is what we seek to include by using the TS correction. Therefore,
as might have anticipated, the calculations that include the van der
Waals correction, Figure 5d,e, show the best match between the observed and calculated
spectra.

Figure 6 Dispersion curves calculated by CASTEP (with the TS correction)
for hexamethylbenzene in the methyl torsion range.

The complete Brillouin zone calculations demonstrate that
the weak
peaks at 52 and 66 cm–1 in the experimental spectrum
are acoustic modes (Figures 5c,e and 6), (which are readily observable
by INS spectroscopy). However, the mode visualizations of the Gaussian
calculation show that the two lowest energy peaks are the torsions,
whereas the periodic-DFT calculations show the torsions to be the
intense peaks between 100 and 150 cm–1. This is
a clear failure of the isolated molecule approximation.

All
of the calculations were carried out at the experimental lattice
parameters. Repeating the calculation (including the TS correction)
allowing these to optimize resulted in a negligible (−0.8%)
change in cell volume, which is unsurprising as the structure was
determined at 5 K.21 Consequently, the
INS spectrum generated from the vibrational calculation using this
structure was almost identical to that which used the experimental
lattice parameters.

Even with the TS correction, there is no
exact agreement. This
probably has several contributions. The absolute accuracy of density
functional theory (DFT) calculations of vibrational transition energies
for gas phase molecules has been extensively investigated (e.g., refs (26) and (27) and reviewed in ref (28)). For molecules with more
than 10 or so atoms, the vibrational modes are usually accurate to
around ±10 cm–1 (typically they are underestimated).
For periodic systems, there has been much less work, but a recent
study of resorcinol29 had similar errors
(excluding the C–H and O–H stretch regions that are
strongly affected by anharmonicity). This accords with our own experience
for a variety of systems, for example, refs (30−33) The crucial factor is that the errors are apparently random and
are not a simple fraction of the transition energy. Thus, in the top
part of Figure 5, there
is a mode calculated at 1360 cm–1 and observed at
1376 cm–1 (a 1.1% difference) but this is more than
close enough that the assignment is unambiguous. However, in the region
below 300 cm–1 errors of this size are relatively
much larger, ∼10%, and this makes the comparison appear poorer.
As stated elsewhere:29 “calculations
of the low-energy transfer range are challenging from the technical
point of view because all the numerical errors accumulate here.”
We also note that the TS correction is a semi-empirical approach,
it is possible that there is still room for improvement.

In
the remainder of the paper, the procedure adopted was to carry
out full dispersion calculations based on structures that had been
geometry optimized (including the TS correction) at the experimental
lattice parameters. Table 1 lists the observed and calculated methyl torsion modes for
the molecules considered here. For those systems, where the structure
is not known, the strongest modes in the low-energy region are assumed
to be the torsions. Where available, the calculated spectra are shown
as part of the full range spectra in the ESI. We will briefly consider
a few specific molecules that are of particular interest.

Toluene
At ambient pressure, in the solid state, toluene
can be prepared as an amorphous phase and two crystalline phases,
α and β.34 The α-phase
is readily prepared on cooling liquid toluene and is the phase observed
here.

The torsional mode in toluene has been extensively investigated
in both the gas phase35−38 and the solid state.39−41 In the gas phase, the methyl group undergoes almost
free rotation35—the barrier is <10
cm–1—and this leads to a description in terms
of rotor and vib-rotor states.36−38 The torsional energies vary as m2F, where m is the torsional quantum number and F is the effective
rotational constant. As the torsional barrier increases, then these
energy levels evolve into torsional vibrational energies. In the solid,
the torsional motion has become trapped and this is what is measured
by INS. Because the molecule is cold and not irradiated, then the
molecules will be in their lowest torsional levels: this would be m = 0, 1 in the gas-phase for a fairly free rotor, and v = 0 for a heavily hindered rotor in the solid state. In
previous work,39,40 the methyl torsion
has been assigned to the strong feature at 47 cm–1. Figure 7 shows the
INS spectra of C6H5CH3, C6D5CH3, and C6D5CD3 in the low-energy region. The mode at 225 cm–1, shown in Figure 7a, that progressively downshifts is the methyl out-of-plane bend.
In contrast, it can be seen that the strong mode at 47 cm–1 (indicated by the dashed line) is almost invariant for C6H5CH3 and C6D5CH3 but undergoes a marked downshift to 41 cm–1 for C6D5CD3. The D/H ratio of the
transition energies is 0.87, somewhat larger than the 0.71 expected
from the ratio of the masses. We will return to this point later.

Figure 7 INS spectra
of toluene isotopomers in the low-energy region. (a)
C6H5CH3, (b) C6D5CH3, and (c) C6D5CD3.
The dashed vertical line shows the position of the methyl torsion.

However, the unit cell of toluene is complex and
includes eight
molecules, thus there should be eight torsional transition energies.
The peak at 47 cm–1 has several sub-maxima, which
probably accounts for some of the modes. Unfortunately, the calculations
are not helpful here, as they predict the torsional modes at 115–127
cm–1, see Figure S2.
However, they do show that there is mixing between the torsion and
the external modes (because they have common symmetry representations
in this space group). This is likely to be the case for the real material,
even though the torsions are at a lower energy than calculated, they
still fall within the external density of states. Thus, the torsions
are not pure modes and the isotopic shift is smaller than what the
mass change predicts.

Xylenes
The structures of all three
isomeric 1,2-dimethylbenzenes
(xylenes) have been determined at low temperature by neutron diffraction.18,19 For ortho and para-xylene, the
observed and calculated spectra are in reasonable agreement, although
the torsional transition energy is somewhat overestimated in ortho-xylene (see Figure S3 and Table 1). For para-xylene, the calculation of the vibrational transition energies at
the Γ-point of the Brillouin zone gave all real modes, however,
the full vibrational dispersion produced several imaginary modes away
from the Γ-point. Repeating the geometry optimization with the
same convergence criteria but also allowing the lattice parameters
to optimize resulted in only a 0.46% change in the cell volume but
with real modes across the entire Brillouin zone. For meta-xylene, there is a marked disagreement between theory and observation, Figure 8a,b. The large discrepancy
between the observed and calculated spectra for meta-xylene, suggests that we have obtained a different phase from that
determined by neutron diffraction.19

Figure 8 Observed (a)
and calculated by CASTEP and (b) INS spectra of meta-xylene. Observed INS spectrum of mesitylene (c), calculated
by CASTEP for phase I (P213) (d), and
for phase III (P1̅) (e).

Mesitylene
1,3,5-Trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) has
three solid state phases, all of which can be obtained at 10 K.11,20 Comparison with the literature spectra11,42 shows that we have obtained the low-temperature phase III. Only
the cubic phase I has been fully characterized crystallographically20 and comparison of the spectrum calculated from
this phase, as expected, gives very poor agreement with the experimental
spectrum, Figure 8c,d.
As noted previously,11,42 there is a very large effect
on the methyl torsional modes on going from phase III → phase
I.

Only the lattice constants are known for phase III which
may be either P1 or P1̅. However,
it is closely related to the monoclinic phase II, which has four molecules
in the primitive cell, with disordered methyl groups.20 To attempt to model phase III, phase II was distorted to
the lattice parameters of phase II and P1̅
symmetry imposed, that is, ordered methyl groups. Both the geometry
and lattice parameters were then allowed to optimize. This
resulted in an almost monoclinic cell. To prevent this, the system
was geometry and lattice optimized but only the cell lengths were
allowed to change, the angles were held at the experimental values.
This converged to a result with a 3% volume expansion. Calculation
of the INS spectrum based on this structure, Figure 8e, shows reasonable agreement with the experimental
spectrum, suggesting that it is a good approximation to the actual
structure. Figure S26 shows the calculated
structure and Table S2 the corresponding
cif file.

Intra-vs Intermolecular Effects in the Methylbenzenes
It is apparent from the preceding discussion that both intramolecular
(the number of methyl groups per benzene molecule) and intermolecular
(the presence of neighboring molecules whether in the same unit cell
or in adjacent ones) effects both play a significant role in determining
the methyl torsion transition energy. For the methylbenzenes, we believe
it is possible to, at least partially, disentangle these undoubtedly
cooperative effects. We consider the intermolecular effect first. Figure 9 shows the average
of the six methyl torsion transition energies of hexamethylbenzene
as a function of the shortest intermolecular distance (in all cases
this is a H···H contact). It can be seen that the average
calculated and observed transition energies are in good agreement
and that even a modest increase from 2.367 Å in the real system
to 4.256 Å results in a sharp decrease of the transition energy.
Increasing the distance further shows a small effect. These calculations
were carried out with the plane-wave code CASTEP; calculation of the
isolated molecule with Gaussian shows only a further small decrease.
This suggests that although the two codes use very different methodologies
the limiting transition energies are essentially the same and that
we can use the Gaussian values as the limiting case.

Figure 9 Comparison of the average
methyl torsion transition energy of hexamethylbenzene
(red dots) and mesitylene (blue diamonds) as a function of the shortest
intermolecular contact. The first two points are the observed and
calculated transition energies for the molecule at the experimental
lattice parameters. The last point on the extreme right for both compounds
is a Gaussian calculation for the isolated molecule. The solid lines
are a guide to the eye.

Figure 10 shows
a comparison of the average methyl torsion transition energy of the
methylbenzenes as a function of the number of methyl groups. In all
cases (except for mesitylene, indicated by M in Figure 10), the presence of intermolecular
interactions increases the average energy by at least 8% and in several
cases by more than 50%. Mesitylene is clearly anomalous. Multiple
attempts with both Gaussian and CASTEP only resulted in all real modes
for the internal modes when symmetry was imposed on the molecule. Figure 9 also shows the results
for mesitylene. With CASTEP it follows the same trend as hexamethylbenzene:
a rapid fall-off with distance to an asymptotic value (33 cm–1); however, the same C3h structure with Gaussian results in an average value of 239 cm–1. We have no explanation for this behavior, however,
we believe that the CASTEP result is the correct one, as there is
no apparent reason for mesitylene to be exceptional. Figure 10 also sheds light on the intramolecular
effect (the number of methyl groups). It is apparent that, generally,
adjacent methyl groups have transition energies in the range 150–200
cm–1, while isolated methyls occur at lower energy.

Figure 10 Average
methyl torsion transition energy of the methylbenzenes
as a function of the number of methyl groups. The solid lines are
the experimental values and the dotted lines are for a Gaussian calculation
of the isolated molecule. “M” is the calculated transition
energy for mesitylene.

Methylnaphthalenes
Figure 11 compares
the INS spectra of naphthalene,
1-methylnaphthalene, and 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene. It is not at all
clear which features are the torsional modes in the methylnaphthalenes.
Computational studies are not helpful here; the structure of 1-methylnaphthalene
is not known and that of 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene is only known for
a disordered room temperature phase,22 only
the lattice parameters are known for the low-temperature phases.43 1-methylnaphthalene is liquid at room temperature
and it is possible that the broad features in the low-energy region
indicate that it was quenched to a glass rather than a crystal.

Figure 11 INS spectra
of: (a) naphthalene, (b) 1-methylnaphthalene, and (c)
2,3-dimethylnaphthalene.

The lattice modes of
naphthalene occur below 150 cm–1, so it is reasonable
to assume that any bands above this energy
are internal modes in the methylnaphthalenes. 1-Methylnaphthalene
is analogous to toluene, so a similar torsional energy might be expected.
There is an apparent excess of intensity at 38 cm–1 as compared to naphthalene, so this is tentatively assigned to the
torsion. Similarly, 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene is analogous to ortho-xylene, where the modes occur in the range 150–200
cm–1 (Table 1), thus the bands in the same region of 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene
at 172 and 228 cm–1 are so assigned. A low resolution
data set44 assigned the mode at 210 cm–1; however, as we have seen for mesitylene, the local
environment has a major influence on the torsional energy and these
assignments are provisional. Knowledge of the low-temperature crystal
structures would be useful, but selective isotopic labeling, as done
for toluene, is the only reliable method to determine the transition
energies unambiguously.

Methylanthracenes
Figure 2 shows the INS spectra of 9-methylanthracene
and 9,10-dimethylanthracene. Unexpectedly, the spectra are markedly
different. In 9-methylanthracene the torsion occurs at 102 cm–1, in good agreement with that calculated (Figure S18 and Table 1). In 9,10-dimethylanthracene, the torsions
are observed at much lower energy, whereas they are calculated at
similar energies to 9-methylanthracene (Figure S19 and Table 1). Again, the disagreement suggests that a low-temperature phase
exists, as both structural determinations were made at room temperature.24,45 In some respects, it is 9-methylanthracene, that is, anomalous,
as isolated rotors (cf. toluene) are expected at low energy, as seen
for 9,10-dimethylanthracene.

Methylated Cycloalkenes
The spectra
of tetra- and pentamethylcyclopentadiene, Figure 3, are generally similar.
The tetramethylcyclopentadiene sample is ∼85% 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene,
so this will dominate the spectrum. In this case, all the methyl groups
are bonded to sp2 carbon atoms and the torsional modes
must be assigned to the intense feature centered at 201 cm–1. The calculated spectrum of pentamethylcyclopentadiene is shown
in Figure S21 and is in reasonable agreement
with the experimental spectrum. In this case, four methyl groups are
bonded to sp2 carbon atoms and the fifth to a sp3 carbon atom. The presence of four molecules in the primitive cell
means that there are 20 torsional modes, interestingly there is a
distinct division between the sp2- and the sp3-bonded methyls: the former occur at or below ∼200 cm–1 and the latter at 266 cm–1.

The solid state behavior of cyclohexene is complex, with several
phases known, both ordered and glassy.46 Quenching the liquid from room temperature in liquid nitrogen, as
was done here, results in a glass, and shown by the featureless density
of states below 130 cm–1, as shown in Figure 4. The two methylcyclohexenes
show a similar “lump” and are, presumably, also glasses.
In these circumstances, it might be hoped that isolated molecule calculations
would be useful because the local environment should be homogeneous:
the specific intermolecular interactions that appear to be crucial
factors in determining the methyl torsional energy are averaged out.
As can be seen in Figure 12, these expectations are met; the calculated spectra are in
reasonable agreement with the experimental data and certainly good
enough to enable assignments to be made. The mode animations show
that the torsion is calculated at 182 cm–1 (194
cm–1 observed) and 237 cm–1 (250
cm–1 observed) in 1-methyl- and 4-methylcyclohex-1-ene
respectively. The separation between methyls bonded to sp2 (≤200 cm–1) and the sp3 (∼250
cm–1) carbon atoms noted for the methylcyclopentadienes
also applies here.

and (c) 4-methylcyclohex-1-ene e.

Methyl Rock and C–H Bend Modes
While the focus
of this paper is the methyl torsion, we will also briefly discuss
the methyl rock and C–H bend modes. Figure 13 shows the region that includes these modes
for all the methylated benzenes. It can be seen that the methyl rock
(expected in the range 800–1000 cm–1)2−4 does not give rise to easily distinguished modes. The methyl C–H
bend modes are more interesting. It can be seen that for molecules
with three or less methyl groups (Figure 13a–g) it is difficult to pick out
these modes. In contrast, for the systems with four or more methyl
groups (Figure 13h–l),
the symmetric (1375 cm–1) and asymmetric (1445 cm–1) modes are clearly seen.

and (l) hexamethylbenzene. The vertical dashed lines show the position

Conclusions
In this paper, we have investigated how
the methyl torsion transition
energy in unsaturated systems is affected by its environment. It has
become apparent that it is strongly influenced by both intramolecular
interactions (the number of methyl groups present in the molecule)
and the intermolecular interactions. For the former, there is a general
pattern that isolated methyl groups occur at lower wavenumber, typically
<100 cm–1, and polymethylated species at ∼100–200
cm–1, although there are exceptions. There also
appears to be a pattern that methyl groups bonded to sp2 carbon atoms occur at ≤200 cm–1 and those
bonded to sp3 carbon atoms occur at ∼250 cm–1, as found for the n-alkanes.6−8

The biggest surprise from this work is that the intermolecular
interactions have a major influence on the torsion transition energy,
as demonstrated unambiguously elsewhere for mesitylene11,39 and also seen here for all the other methylbenzenes. The interactions
result in the torsional transition energy being raised by at least
8%, as compared to the isolated molecule, and often much more. In
part, this may be caused by the fact that the methyl torsion is rarely
a pure mode (unless enforced by symmetry). It occurs in the lattice
(translational and librational) mode region and, for polycyclic aromatic
species, where the whole-body out-of-plane deformations occur. The
extent of the mixing with these would make the torsional mode dependent
on its immediate neighbors.

The agreement between the observed
and CASTEP calculated spectra
is generally good, although not perfect, toluene being a case in point,
and highlights just how demanding it is to obtain accurate transition
energies for low energy modes. The disagreement between the observed
and calculated INS spectra for meta-xylene and 9,10-dimethylanthracene
is so severe that it would suggest that there are additional phases
to those presently known.

Experimental Section
The compounds
were obtained from commercial sources (see Table
S1 of the Supporting Information) and used
as received. Liquid samples were loaded into 1 mm pathlength indium
wire-sealed Al sample holders, solid samples were wrapped in aluminium
foil. Sample masses ranged from 0.5–3.4 g. The INS spectra
were recorded at ≤ 20 K using a broad band high-resolution
spectrometer TOSCA47 at the ISIS Pulsed
Neutron and Muon Facility (Oxfordshire, UK).48

Computational
Methods
Isolated molecule DFT calculations
were performed with Gaussian 09.49 The
B3LYP functional with the 6-311G(d) basis set was used in all cases.
Periodic DFT calculations were carried out with the plane wave pseudopotential
program CASTEP.50 The geometry optimization
used the generalized gradient PBE51 functional
together with the TS dispersion correction.52 The plane wave cutoff was 750 eV, and the forces were converged
to better than |0.01| eV Å–1, the k-point grid used depended on the initial structure and is given in Table S1. The vibrational spectra at the Γ-point
in the Brillouin zone were calculated using density functional perturbation
theory.53 Phonon dispersion was calculated
along high-symmetry directions throughout the Brillouin zone. Dynamical
matrices were computed on a regular grid of wavevectors throughout
the Brillouin zone and Fourier interpolation was used to extend the
computed grid to the desired fine set of points along the high-symmetry
paths. The initial structures were taken from the Cambridge Structural
Database,54 the refcodes are included in Table S1. Calculated INS spectra were generated
from the Gaussian or CASTEP output using ACLIMAX55 or AbINS.56
