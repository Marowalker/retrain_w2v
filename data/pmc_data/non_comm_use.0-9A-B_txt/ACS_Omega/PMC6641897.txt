Many natural organic
compounds with pharmaceutical applications,
including antibiotics (chlortetracycline and vancomycin), antifungal
compounds (pyrrolnitrin), and chemotherapeutics (salinosporamide A
and rebeccamycin) are chlorinated. Halogenating enzymes like tryptophan
7-halogenase (PrnA) and tryptophan 5-halogenase (PyrH) perform regioselective
halogenation of tryptophan. In this study, the conformational dynamics
of two flavin-dependent tryptophan halogenases—PrnA and PyrH—was
investigated through molecular dynamics simulations, which are in
agreement with the crystallographic and kinetic experimental studies
of both enzymes and provide further explanation of the experimental
data at an atomistic level of accuracy. They show that the binding
sites of the cofactor-flavin adenine dinucleotide and the substrate
do not come into close proximity during the simulations, thus supporting
an enzymatic mechanism without a direct contact between them. Two
catalytically important active site residues, glutamate (E346/E354)
and lysine (K79/K75) in PrnA and PyrH, respectively, were found to
play a key role in positioning the proposed chlorinating agent, hypochlorous
acid. The changes in the regioselectivity between PrnA and PyrH arise
as a consequence of differences in the orientation of substrate in
its binding site.

Introduction
Many pharmaceutically
important natural organic compounds (including
antibiotics, such as chlortetracycline1 and vancomycin,2 the antifungal compound
pyrrolnitrin3 and chemotherapeutics, such
as salinosporamide A4 and rebeccamycin5) are chlorinated. Halogenating enzymes perform
regioselective halogenation of aromatic compounds efficiently in a
solution using only chloride ions at physiological temperatures and
atmospheric pressure. However, selective nonenzymatic chlorination
of the C–H bonds is a chemical synthesis challenge.6 For example, the halogenation of tryptophan in
the solution lacks regioselectivity and produces a mixture of products
with chlorine added at the 1st, 5th, and 7th carbon of the indole
ring.7 From an industrial point of view,
this is unacceptable, as the desired isomer is produced with a lower
yield and is expensive to separate from the other isomers. Interestingly,
many natural products with pharmaceutical relevance contain halogen
atoms at a range of different positions. These would be difficult
to synthesize chemocatalytically and rely on the use of protecting
groups and metal-based catalysts. Such strategies introduce extra
reaction steps to the synthesis, increasing financial costs and lowering
yields.8 Hence, a detailed understanding
of the enzymatic mechanism of regioselective chlorination/halogenation
of natural organic compounds and knowledge of the origin of the regioselectivity
is of importance to organic chemical synthesis. Halogenating enzymes
are attractive as biocatalysts because they can be engineered to suit
different synthetic purposes,9 not only
adjusting their regioselectivity but also their ability to accept
a range of different substrates, such as indoles and other aryl-based
substrates.10

The indole ring of
tryptophan gets chlorinated at different positions
of the 5th, 6th, or 7th carbon atom by distinct flavin-dependent halogenases,
these include tryptophan 5-halogenase (PyrH11), tryptophan 6-halogenases (Thal12 and
SttH13), and tryptophan 7-halogenases (RebH14 and PrnA15), respectively.
All of these enzymes exhibit high levels of regio- and stereoselectivity.
For example, chlorination of the indole ring of tryptophan at its
sixth carbon atom by tryptophan 6-halogenase (Thal12) has been suggested to be the first step of the biosynthesis
of the indole alkaloid thienodolin—a natural compound that
exhibits plant growth-regulating activity. Our study focuses on the
structural analysis through extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of two flavin-dependent halogenases, namely, PrnA (tryptophan 7-halogenase)
and PyrH (tryptophan 5-halogenase). PrnA catalyzes the chlorination
of free tryptophan to 7-chlorotryptophan as a first step in the biosynthesis
of the antibiotic and antifungal compound pyrrolnitrin.3 PyrH catalyzes the chlorination of free tryptophan
to 5-chlorotryptophan as a part of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic
pyrroindomycin B.11 It is important to
understand the reasons for regioselectivity, with a focus on the structural
differences at the active sites of these structurally similar enzymes.

X-ray crystallographic structures of the two halogenases are available
from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).15,16 The structure
of PrnA is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 X-ray PrnA structure drawn using PrnA displayed in silhouette round
ribbon. Substrate (Trp-S), cofactor FAD, chlorination agent, hypochlorous
acid, and the side chains of the catalytically important K79 and E346
are shown in tube representation. Hypochlorous acid and the to-be
halogenated carbon of Trp-S are shown in spherical representation.
Carbons are green, nitrogens are dark blue, oxygens are red, and hydrogens
are white.

Several reaction mechanisms were
proposed for the enzymatic chlorination
of tryptophan performed by tryptophan 7-halogenase.9 In the van Pée mechanism, the aryl ring of tryptophan
reacts directly with hydroperoxy-FAD to produce a hydroxylated tryptophan
intermediate.17 The positively charged
intermediate is then attacked by a chloride ion to produce a chlorinated
hydroxyl-tryptophan product. This product undergoes an elimination
of water to produce the chlorinated tryptophan product.17 In the Walsh mechanism, chloride attacks hydroperoxy-FAD
to produce a FAD-OCl intermediate. The tryptophan substrate (Trp-S)
can then attack the chlorine of the FAD-OCl intermediate in a classical
electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.18 The van Pée and Walsh mechanisms rely on the possibility
that the FAD and tryptophan-binding sites of the enzyme can be brought
within a suitable proximity for direct contact between the FAD and
Trp-S.17,18 Inspection of the crystal structures of
the known FAD-dependent halogenase enzymes shows a >10 Å distance
between the FAD and tryptophan-binding sites (Figure 2).11−15 The separation between the ligands would be too distant for direct
interaction. However, close contact between the cofactor and the substrate,
though not observable in the crystal structure, is a possibility that
cannot be entirely excluded. A large conformational change could take
place in the protein structure, bringing the two binding sites into
close proximity and allowing direct reaction between the two ligands.

views A and B of the ribbon representation of the
PrnA crystal structure, with Trp-S, FAD, hypochlorous acid, K79, and
E346 rendered as tubes and labeled. Hypochlorous acid and the to-be
halogenated carbon of Trp-S are represented with a sphere rendering.
Carbons are bright green and additional element colors are as follows:
nitrogen is dark blue, oxygen is red, and hydrogen is white. In addition,
the distance between the FAD C4A carbon and Trp-S C7 atom is drawn
with a dashed line and the distance is labeled in blue.

A third mechanism put forward by Naismith et al.
suggests that
hypochlorous acid is produced at the FAD-binding site by the reaction
of a chloride ion and hydroperoxy-FAD. Hypochlorous acid then travels
through a channel between the FAD and tryptophan-binding sites.15,19 Once in proximity to tryptophan, the active site lysine and glutamate
residues facilitate a reaction between hypochlorous acid and tryptophan
to produce the chlorinated tryptophan product.15,20 Because the FAD- and tryptophan-binding sites are distant, the chlorinating
agent, hypochlorous acid, is thought to travel through a channel in
the protein.15 Two amino acids K79 and
E346 in PrnA (analogous to K75 and E354 in PyrH) are positioned in
close proximity to the reactive carbon of tryptophan’s indole
ring. They are thought to be involved in the activation of the hypochlorous
acid for the halogenation step of the reaction.19 The role of K79 and E346 in PrnA is supported by an experimental
mutagenesis, showing that the K79A mutant had no detectable activity,
and in the E346Q mutant, the Kcat value
for the halogenation is decreased by 2 orders of magnitude.15

PyrH and PrnA share a 40% sequence identity
and a 58% sequence
similarity, making their structures similar.21 Despite this similarity, the catalytic turnovers of tryptophan 7-halogenase
and tryptophan 5-halogenase differ. For example, PyrH was found to
convert 100% of its Trp-S, whereas PrnA converted only 59% of its
substrate and the origin of this difference has not yet been elucidated.10 In the FAD-binding site of the crystal structure
of PyrH, a “strap” region was identified and hypothesized
as a structural feature that allows for “communication”
between the two binding sites that are involved in the regulation
of FAD binding. The overlaid crystal structures of PyrH and PrnA reveal
that the FAD-binding sites are almost identical (Figure 3). Structural analysis showed
that PyrH possesses a structurally different tryptophan binding site
to that of PrnA. Trp-S in the PyrH crystal structure is bound in a
way that is upside down with respect to tryptophan in the PrnA crystal
structure (Figure 3). However, the to-be halogenated carbon of Trp-S in PrnA (C7) and
PyrH (C5) superimpose well when the two protein structures are aligned.
The positioning of the reactive carbon is located between the active
site lysine and glutamate residues, which show similar orientation
across the two enzymes. In a recent study investigating the reaction
mechanism for the chlorination of tryptophan in PrnA, quantum mechanics
(QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) methods were applied to study the potential
energy and free energy surfaces of the chlorination reaction.22 Key atomistic interactions in the stationary
points and energetic changes along the reaction path were explored.
They reported that E346 fulfills the role of a proton acceptor and
hydrogen-bonding residue for Trp-S, whereas K79 acts as a proton donor
and hydrogen-bonding residue for the hypochlorous acid. The structural
data suggest that the reason for different regioselectivity of the
two enzymes would be related to the binding interactions of Trp-S
in the active sites.22

and the active lysine and glutamate residues are rendered as tubes

green and PyrH in light blue.

Enzymes are large, flexible, and dynamic molecules that naturally
undergo a wide range of conformational changes and molecular motions
ranging from femtoseconds to hours.23 Many
of these motions are functionally important and relate enzyme structure
to function.24 Experimentally determined
protein structures (e.g., by X-ray crystallography) provide valuable
structural information, however, limited to a static structure, averaged
over the number of molecules in the crystal lattice, and the duration
of the experiment.25 In addition, steric
effects can also arise due to the compactness of the crystal environment.26 Enzyme conformational flexibility plays a substantial
role in stabilizing the protein interactions vital in facilitating
ligand binding and unbinding events.27 Molecular
plasticity is involved in assisting the migration of ligands to the
binding site, as well as the diffusion of gases and small molecules
through the protein.28 Mutations of key
residues, involved in catalysis and binding, can not only influence
locally the structure but also exercise a long-range structural effect
on the protein conformation as a whole. Exploration of the dynamic
events in proteins, using experimental methods, can be a challenge;
thus, computer-based experiments, for example, MD simulations can
be applied to study this.23−25,29 Long-range atomistic MD simulations were performed to elucidate
structure–function relationships and mechanistic implications
related to the origin of regioselectivity in both enzymes.

Methods
An initial structure for the MD simulations of the wild-type full
complex PrnA was created from the pdb structure of the enzyme (PDBID: 2AR8).15 The product 7-chlorotryptophan was separated to create
tryptophan and hypochlorous acid; in addition, the chloride ion bound
at the FAD-binding site was removed and FAD was modified to create
hydroxy-FAD (from this point forward, FAD will refer to hydroxy-FAD).
These changes were made with the aim to create the active full complex
before the halogenation of Trp-S. Modification of the atomic coordinates
was performed using Maestro 9.9.013.30 Structures
of the mutant forms K79A and E346Q were prepared by changing the respective
residues in the wild-type full complex structure using Maestro.30 The initial structure of PyrH (PDBID: 2WET) for MD simulations
was prepared by superimposing the pdb structure with that of the wild-type
full complex PrnA. The coordinates of hypochlorous acid from this
were then added to 2WET, as they were not present in the crystal structure.16 In addition to this, the sulfate and chloride ions from
the crystal structure were also removed. The parameters for FAD and
hypochlorous acid were generated by the PRODRG web server31 for the GROMOS96 43a1 forcefield32 with atomic partial charges for hypochlorous
acid supplemented from QM calculations performed by the Automated
Topology Builder web server.33 The missing
coordinates of the two loop regions in the 2WET structure were modeled using the Modeller34 plug-in for Chimera 1.10.2.35 The setup for PyrH then followed the same protocol as the
one for PrnA. In total, the PrnA full complex had 94 114 atoms
and PyrH 97 090 atoms. The hydrogen atoms missing from the
X-ray crystal structure were added using Gromacs 4.5.5.36 To remove unfavorable steric clashes in the
starting structure, in vacuo energy minimization was performed using
the steepest descent algorithm until the maximum force was less than
100 kJ mol–1 nm–1, the protein
was then placed in a box with periodic boundary conditions. The energy-minimized
protein structure was then solvated using the single point charge37 model for water. The total charge of the system
was neutralized by adding the correct number of Na+ or
Cl– ions to make the overall charge of the system
zero. Another energy minimization (using the same conditions as described
for in vacuo energy minimization) was then performed to reduce close
contacts between the solvent molecules or the ions that may be unfavorably
close to the protein structure. The energy-minimized structure was
then subject to position-restrained MD for 50 ps at 300 K, during
that, the protein structure was restrained and the water was allowed
to equilibrate. The position-restrained dynamics simulations were
performed in NVT ensemble, a constant number of particles, volume,
and temperature with a time step of 2 fs. The productive MD was then
carried out with the output structure from the position-restrained
MD providing the initial structure for 1 μs as in NPT ensemble
at a temperature of 300 K. The MD trajectories were analyzed over
the time period of 100–1000 ns, after equilibration phase was
reached, using tools provided in Gromacs. Visualization and inspection
of the trajectories were performed with visual molecular dynamics.38 Dynamic cross correlation analysis (DCCA) was
performed using the Bio3D package39 for
Rstudio.40 The DCCA is used to visualize
which residues play a role in correlated motions that occur between
different components of the protein structure.41 The level of correlation between each Cα atom can
be quantified and visualized on a plot, with correlations ranging
from +1 to −1, indicating a strong positive to a negative correlation.
This allows the identification of regions in the protein, showing
correlated motion in the simulation.

Results and Discussion
Conformational
Dynamics of Full Complex Wild-Type PrnA
In total, five 1
μs MD simulations were performed: the full
complex of wild-type PrnA, apoenzyme PrnA, two single point mutant
forms, K79A and E346Q, of PrnA, as well as the full complex wild-type
PyrH.

The root mean square deviation (RMSD) profile for all
Cα atoms for the 1 μs MD simulation of the wild-type full
complex PrnA is 3.5 Å. The RMSD profiles of all five of the 1
μs simulations (Figure 4) indicated that the initial equilibration phase was completed
after 100 ns. In addition to the 1 μs simulation, three additional
200 ns MD simulations of the wild-type full complex of PrnA were performed.
These used the same initial structure but different initial velocities
(Supporting Information (SI) Figure S1).
These simulations were created to evaluate the effect of statistical
error on the quality of the simulations. The RMSDs for each of these
trajectories was consistent with the 1 μs wild-type full complex
PrnA simulation indicating good quality of the simulations. The radius
of gyration of all four 1 μs simulations (SI Figure S2) was 23 Å, showing that the protein remains
relatively compact during the simulation time scale.

Figure 4 RMSD plot of all five
1 μs MD simulations: the PrnA full
complex, apoenzyme PrnA, PyrH full complex, and the K79A and E346Q
mutant forms of PrnA.

The average RMSD of the full complex wild-type PrnA is 3.5
Å
and in the apoenzyme PrnA is 3.6 Å, indicating a slight trend
of increased flexibility of the apoenzyme form possibly due to the
absence of bound ligands. The average RMSD of PyrH was 2.8 Å,
reflecting its relatively lower flexibility compared with PrnA. The
solvent accessible area (SAS) of the apoenzyme PrnA is lower than
the SAS of the full complex wild-type PrnA (Figure 5). The radius of gyration also indicates
a more compact structure of the apoenzyme form of PrnA with respect
to the full complex PrnA (SI Figure S2).
These observations are consistent with the differences in the RMSDs
of the full complex PrnA and apoenzyme PrnA, and are indicative of
conformational changes associated with ligand binding and an opening
of the PrnA structure upon ligand binding. PyrH is characterized as
having overall lower levels of flexibility and a more compact structure
than the full complex PrnA (Figure 4 and SI Figure S2).

area graph of the PrnA full complex and PrnA
apoenzyme simulations.

The root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profiles of the full
complex
PrnA and apoenzyme PrnA are presented in Figure 6. For the full complex PrnA, the peak centered
on residue P93 exhibits a high RMSF, reflecting its position at a
particularly flexible portion of the loop that precedes key tryptophan
interacting residues: H101, F103, G104, and N105. These residues are
involved in the binding of Trp-S. It is therefore possible that the
flexibility of this loop is related to the binding and orientation
of Trp-S.

Figure 6 RMSF plot of the PrnA full complex and PrnA apoenzyme simulations.

A flexible loop consisting of
residues 147–159 has a maximum
RMSF value of 6.7 Å (centered on residue G152) in the full complex
PrnA (Figure 6). The
same region has an RMSF value of 1.8 Å in the apoenzyme form
of PrnA. This loop is located on the exterior of the protein and is
solvent exposed, forming several intraloop hydrogen bonds. The loop
immediately precedes S157, a hydrogen bond stabilizing residue of
Trp-S. The RMSD plot of the loop region 147–159 (Figure 7) shows that the loop is adopting
a stable orientation after 300 ns. In this conformation, S157 forms
a hydrogen bond with the carboxylate of Trp-S. The dynamics of the
loop differ greatly between the full complex wild-type PrnA and the
apoenzyme PrnA, suggesting that a conformational change occurs in
the loop upon binding of Trp-S. In the apoenzyme, the S157 side chain
forms hydrogen bonds with the neighboring residues A80, M156, and
Y443 instead. These intraloop protein–protein hydrogen bonds
stabilize the 149–159 loop of the apoenzyme and maintain a
more compact conformation, which is reflected in the lower RMSD of
the loop in the apoenzyme (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Plot showing the relationship between the RMSD of the
flexible
loop region in both the full complex PrnA and the apoenzyme PrnA spanning
residues 147–170 (left y-axis), and the hydrogen-bonding
interaction distance between S157 side chain oxygen and Trp-S (right y-axis).

Conformational changes
in enzymes are complex and involve collective
motions between different regions of the protein molecule.42 To analyze the collective correlated motions
in the studied tryptophan halogenase enzymes, we performed DCCA. In
the full complex PrnA, a correlated motion between the portion of
the FAD strap region closest to Trp-S (residues 50–54) and
the important catalytic residue E346 was found, and supports the idea
of the strap region being an important link between the two binding
sites (Figure 8).

Figure 8 DCCA plot
of the PrnA full complex simulation. Areas of strongly
positive correlation are in red and areas of strongly negative correlation
are in blue.

In the DCCA plot of the
full complex wild-type PrnA (Figure 8), a region of positive correlations
corresponds to two areas of protein from residues 205 to 255 and 305
to 350 (Figure 9).
The area makes up a large part of the FAD-binding site and contains
many important FAD-binding residues. It also contains important residues
from the tryptophan-binding site, such as E346 and S347.

Figure 9 Two DCCA correlated
regions described as spanning residues 205–255
in red and the region spanning from residues 305 to 350 in blue. The
important residues E346 and S347 are displayed along with FAD and
the substrate tryptophan in green carbon tubes.

The region of residues from 355 to 380 that shows fluctuation
in
both the RMSF plot (Figure 6) of the full complex wild-type PrnA and apoenzyme PrnA correspond
to a long α-helix that intersects the FAD- and tryptophan-binding
sites. It contains the tryptophan hydrogen-bonding residue, Y351.
In the DCCA plot of the full complex wild-type PrnA (Figure 8), this region of residues,
355–380, shows correlation with an important tryptophan-binding
residue W455. A relatively large span of residues 396–456 directly
precedes the important tryptophan binding residues (Y443, Y444, W455,
E450, F454, and N459) and shows more fluctuation in the full complex
than the apoenzyme (Figure 6). These residues form several helices joined by short loops.
Interactions between the helices create a compact and less flexible
hydrophobic cluster.

Tryptophan-Binding Site Interactions of Wild-Type
PrnA
The high level of regioselectivity of FAD-dependent
halogenases is
thought to depend on the proper orientation of Trp-S.43 Tryptophan positioning and orientation allows for the respective
carbon atom from the indole ring (C7 in PrnA and C5 in PyrH) to be
favorably oriented for the reaction. To accomplish stable binding
of tryptophan, an extensive network of hydrogen bonds (Figure 10), electrostatic interactions
(SI Figure S3), and van der Waals interactions
(Figure 11) were found.
The measured distances of interactions of Trp-S observed in the X-ray
crystal structure and wild-type full complex PrnA MD simulation are
recorded in Tables 1 and 2.15 K79 and
E346, thought to be important for hypochlorous acid activation, are
also involved in a network of hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions
that maintain their orientations in the active site relative to Trp-S
and the chlorinating agent, hypochlorous acid.19,22

Figure 10 Hydrogen-bonding interactions surrounding Trp-S in PrnA. The distances
between the donors and acceptors are shown in Table 1.

Figure 11 Hydrophobic contacts surrounding Trp-S in PrnA. The distances between
the centers of mass of the Trp-S indole ring and the hydrophobic amino
acid side chains are shown in Table 2.

Measurements
were made between the donor and acceptor atoms for
hydrogen bonds. Measurements for electrostatic interactions (highlighted
in gray) were measured between the centers of the charged groups.

Trp-S (Table 1)
can act as both hydrogen bond donor and acceptor with its amino nitrogen,
carboxylate oxygen, and indole ring nitrogen atoms. The backbone nitrogen
of G104 participates in a hydrogen bond with Trp-S’s carboxylate.
This interaction does not exist in the crystal structure but is stable
during the MD trajectory. The amino group of tryptophan is hydrogen
bonded to the side chain phenolic oxygen of Y443, and the backbone
carbonyl oxygen of F454. The amino group of tryptophan can also make
electrostatic interactions (Table 1) with the carboxylate of E450 with an average distance
of 4.2 Å. E450 in turn interacts with the side chain amino group
of K57 (distance 5.8 Å), which would help more efficient binding
of Trp-S.

Hypochlorous acid can participate in hydrogen bonds
and interactions
with charged residues in the enzyme active site. The hydrogen atom
of hypochlorous acid has a partial positive charge (0.455e) and forms a strong hydrogen bond with the side chain of E346 (Table 1). In the initial
structure of the PrnA full complex, K79 is in close proximity to hypochlorous
acid and seems a likely candidate for hydrogen bonding; however, during
the MD simulation, hypochlorous acid moves away from K79, reflected
in the average distance of 6.7 Å in the MD (Table 1). The carboxylate side chain
of E346 has two oxygen atoms, OE1 and OE2, with which it is possible
to form hydrogen bonds (Table 1). The E346 carboxylate forms an electrostatic interaction
with the NE2 nitrogen atom of the protonated H395 side chain. Hypochlorous
acid makes strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the carboxylate
side chain of E346. The E346 carboxylate side chain also interacts
with the positively charged doubly protonated H395 (Table 1). In the crystal structure,
the indole nitrogen atom of tryptophan forms a hydrogen bond with
the backbone carbonyl oxygen of E346. However, in the MD simulation,
the backbone carbonyl of E346 moves away from tryptophan to make other
hydrogen-bonding interactions with T348 and the hydroxyl oxygen of
hydroperoxyflavin moiety of FAD.10

F103, W455, and H101 form π–π stacking interactions
with tryptophan (respective average distances of 4.7, 5.1, and 6.3
Å). Throughout the MD simulation, W455 remains close to Trp-S
participating in a stable π–π stacking interaction
with the substrate (Table 2). E346 and hypochlorous acid are also located in a close
proximity to the side chain of W455; however, W455 does not become
halogenated. K79 is not found in proximity to W455, indicating that
the proximity to both K79 and E346 is needed for the halogenation
reaction to occur.

A positive correlation between residues 100–130
and residues
475–505 is found in the DCCA of the full complex wild-type
PrnA (Figure 8). The
region of residues 475–505 forms a long α-helix running
perpendicular to the H101/F103 region. The correlation is likely to
be caused by hydrophobic interactions between the two regions of the
loop portions of the H101/F103 (SI Figure S4). These two regions are interwoven and any movement in one will
affect the other region as well.

FAD-Binding Site in PrnA
A structural feature previously
observed in the crystal structure of PyrH is the FAD-binding strap.
This strap region is thought to control the binding of FAD and also
hypothesized to act as a line of communication between the FAD-binding
and tryptophan-binding sites in PyrH.16 In the crystallographic study of PyrH, the electron density of the
strap region is relatively low, implying that it is a particularly
flexible region of PyrH.16 Through inspection
of the crystal structure of PrnA, we found that a similar strap region
superimposes with that of the PyrH crystal structure and would also
exists in PrnA (Figure 3). The high flexibility of the strap region shown in SI Figure S5, together with its probable influence
on both FAD and tryptophan (Figure 3), points toward the strap region fulfilling a similar
role to the one hypothesized to perform in PyrH. In both enzymes,
the strap region consists of a long straight section of residues running
parallel to FAD without secondary structure elements (Figure 3). The region of the strap
that is in close contact with FAD forms several hydrogen bonds (SI Figure S6) and hydrophobic and cation−π
interactions (SI Figure S7) with FAD. These
are evident in the crystal structure as well as the MD simulations
of the PrnA wild-type full complex (SI Tables S1 and S2).20

FAD is a relatively
large molecule, and in the crystal structure, it adopts a linear extended
conformation, whereas in the MD, we see it undergoing a structural
transition around 200 ns to adopt a bent conformation (SI Figure S8). We also see this structural transition
of FAD in the MD simulations of PrnA and PyrH. In the PrnA full complex
simulation, the change in the conformation of FAD happens simultaneously
with a structural transition seen in the FAD strap region (SI Figure S5). After 200 ns, the strap adopts a
conformation that shows reduced structural flexibility. In comparison,
the RMSD of the strap region in the apoenzyme form of PrnA shows a
higher flexibility as well as larger fluctuations (SI Figure S5). The increased flexibility of the
strap region in the apoenzyme PrnA MD in contrast to the full complex
PrnA MD suggests that the strap region is involved in the binding
of FAD and becomes more stable in its presence, which can be seen
by comparing hydrogen-bonding interactions of FAD in the X-ray crystal
structure to those from the MD (SI Table S2).

The RMSF profile of the strap region (SI Figure S9) shows that although the strap region in the apoenzyme form
of PrnA possesses a higher flexibility than the strap region in the
full complex PrnA form, this is mainly due to the high flexibility
of residues 45–49. These residues are located in close proximity
to the flavin moiety of FAD and form stable hydrogen-bonding interactions
with it (SI Table S2). The region of residues
from 50 to 53 connects the FAD-binding residues to those of the tryptophan-binding
site. S54 hydrogen bonds E450, which is a key residue for the binding
of the amino group of tryptophan. The equilibration of the strap region
and FAD after 150 ns causes a conformational change that brings the
side chain of S54 into the proximity of E450 to form a hydrogen bond
(SI Figure S10). This movement brings E450
into the proximity of the tryptophan amino group, where it forms an
electrostatic interaction (Table 1). This conformational change provides an atomistic
basis for the predicted communication between FAD and tryptophan-binding
sites. The binding of FAD can influence the binding of tryptophan
by means of the strap region running through both domains.

The
hydrophobic interactions between FAD and the protein in the
MD simulations and X-ray crystal structure are predominantly with
the flavin moiety of FAD (SI Table S1).
The adenine moiety of FAD also has the potential to form a cation−π
interaction with the side chain of R221 (SI Table S1). Most hydrogen bonds with the adenine moiety of FAD are
formed with the backbone carbonyl oxygen and nitrogen atoms of the
surrounding residues (SI Table S2). A50,
S347, T348, and I350 are the key residues found to form stable hydrogen-bonding
interactions with the flavin ring moiety of FAD. The backbone carbonyl
groups of E346 and P344 interact with the hydroxyl group of FAD. The
interaction between hydroxy-FAD and E346 could influence the communication
between FAD and Trp-S.

Possibility of Direct Contact between FAD-
and Tryptophan-Binding
Site/Module
The 1 μs MD simulations show that close
contact between FAD and tryptophan does not occur at this time scale.
The distance between the FAD-binding site and the substrate-binding
site remains relatively high during MD. The average distance between
the centers of mass of the FAD- and tryptophan-binding sites was found
to be 12.1, 13.5, and 14.2 Å, respectively, for PrnA full complex,
apoenzyme PrnA, and PyrH full complex MD simulations (Figure 12). The distance between C4A
atom of FAD and the to-be halogenated carbon of tryptophan (C7/C5)
remains high throughout the MD simulations of PrnA and PyrH (Table 3). The side chains
of residues K79 and E346 remain distant from flavin at the 1 μs
time scale of the MD simulations (Table 3). Some hydrogen bonding is found between
the hydroxyl group of flavin and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of E346.
This would not, however, allow for direct halogenation of the E346
or K79 side chains (SI Table S1). These
observations support the main catalytic mechanism in which the intermediary
halogenating agent is created at the FAD-binding site and travels
through a channel between the FAD- and tryptophan-binding sites.15,22

Conformational
Effects of the Mutations of K79 and E346
Mutational studies
show that both K79 and E346 in PrnA and K75 and
E354 in PyrH play a vital role in the reaction of chlorination of
tryptophan. The residues are conserved across the known FAD-dependent
halogenases: PyrH11 (tryptophan 5-halogenase),
Thal12 and SttH13 (tryptophan 6-halogenases) and RebH,14 and PrnA15 (trypthophan 7-halogenases),
indicating their key roles in the catalysis.44 In PrnA, the mutation K79A leads to a complete loss of activity
and the mutation E346Q shows activity that is reduced by 2 orders
of magnitude to a level where it is barely detectable.15 Although possessing no formal charge, hypochlorous
acid has a strong dipole moment (oxygen −0.456 D and hydrogen
0.445 D calculated by the automated force field topology builder33) and interactions with K79 and E346 will have
an influence on its position and orientation. To test the stabilizing
effect of the two charged residues and to explain the experimental
effects of the mutations, we performed the MD simulations on in silico
mutated forms of PrnA K79A and E346Q. Without the electrostatic environment
created by both K79 and E346, hypochlorous acid moves away from tryptophan
and back along the channel toward FAD. In this position, hypochlorous
acid is too distant from tryptophan and would likely be unable to
participate in the halogenation reaction (SI Figure S11). In the MD simulation of K79A mutant, the hypochlorous
acid remains closer to the flavin ring and forms hydrogen bonds with
the O4 atom of FAD. In the E346Q mutant form MD simulation, the hypochlorous
acid moves away from the tryptophan-binding site along the channel
toward FAD, where it forms a hydrogen bond with T263. This residue,
although close to K79, is separated by internal protein structure
and not accessible for interaction with hypochlorous acid. The simulations
of the two mutant forms show increased hypochlorous acid Cl to Trp-C7
distances relative to the wild-type PrnA. This indicates to us that
both residues are of key importance for the positioning of hypochlorous
acid in proximity to tryptophan.

Comparison of PyrH to PrnA
PyrH and PrnA are structurally
similar enzymes that carry out similar reactions but exhibit different
kinetics. PyrH is a more efficient enzyme at chlorinating tryptophan,
it achieves 100% conversion to 5-chlorotryptophan, whereas under the
same conditions, PrnA converts only 59% of tryptophan to 7-chlorotryptophan,
with the remaining tryptophan unreacted.10 The binding mode of FAD in both enzymes is almost identical, and
the FAD molecules overlay almost perfectly when the two proteins are
aligned (Figures 3 and 13). The differences in their regioselectivity and
kinetics probably originate in the tryptophan-binding domain. The
way these two enzymes bind Trp-S in the active site is quite different,
Trp-S in PyrH is oriented in an upside-down position relative to its
binding orientation in PrnA. The benzene moieties of the indole rings
for both PrnA and PyrH are nearly superimposable in the crystal structure
(Figure 14). This
indicates that the C5 atom in PyrH is in an almost identical place
to that of the C7 atom in PrnA. During the MD simulation of PyrH,
we observe a rotation of Trp-S to a slightly different orientation,
and after equilibration, this orientation remains relatively stable
(SI Figure S12). Despite this movement,
the relative orientation of the C5 atom of the indole ring of tryptophan
toward K75 and E354 remains the same. The position of hypochlorous
acid in the PyrH MD simulation also remains more stable relative to
the PrnA MD, which is indicated by the lower levels of fluctuation
in the RMSD plot of hypochlorous acid in SI Figure S13.

substrate tryptophan is rendered as a sphere.

The higher efficiency of PyrH as an enzyme may correlate
with the
reduced flexibility of the PyrH tryptophan-binding site. A more rigid
binding site can make PyrH a more efficient enzyme for halogenating
tryptophan.10 The averaged distances from
the MD trajectories between K79/K75-NZ, hypochlorous acid Cl, and
Trp (C7 in PrnA and C5 in PyrH) are shown in SI Figures S14 and S15. K79/K75-NZ to hypochlorous acid Cl and
tryptophan C7/C5 in PyrH show that hypochlorous acid makes more stable
interactions with relatively lower levels of fluctuations between
the active lysine and glutamate residues. The stability of these interactions
could mean that more energetically favorable interactions take place
in PyrH as opposed to PrnA. This could be one of the contributing
factors to the experimentally observed greater catalytic turnover
of PyrH compared to PrnA.

The average RMSD of PyrH was 2.8 Å,
which is significantly
lower than the PrnA full complex and PrnA apoenzyme simulations and
means that PyrH is less flexible than PrnA (Figure 4). In the RMSF plot comparing the PyrH full
complex and PrnA full complex MD simulations (SI Figure S16), the region around G37, which immediately precedes
the FAD binding strap that runs from residues 37–50, we see
a similar feature, the FAD strap region, seen in the RMSF plot of
PrnA. However, in PyrH, this region shows lower levels of flexibility.
In PyrH, both the FAD strap region (SI Figure S17) and FAD show more conformational fluctuations than those
in the PrnA full complex simulation (SI Figure S18). Due to the differences in the tryptophan-binding sites
between PyrH and PrnA, we found no analogous interaction between S50
and E452 in PrnA. Instead, a direct hydrogen-bonding interaction between
the side chain of S50 and the carboxylate moiety of Trp-S is found
(SI Table S3). This suggests that despite
the differences in tryptophan-binding between PyrH and PrnA, the role
of the strap region remains the same in the two enzymes.

In
PrnA, the flexible loop region, which spans residues 147–159,
might be important for tryptophan binding. In the MD simulation, we
identified a hydrogen bond between the side chain of S157 and the
carboxylate moiety of tryptophan, which was affected by the dynamics
of the 147–159 loop. We propose that this relationship is important
for tryptophan binding (Figure 7). In PyrH, there is a similarly positioned flexible loop
that had to be modeled due to its lack of coordinates in the crystal
structure.16 This loop of residues from
148 to 165 in PyrH is similar to the loop 147–159 in PrnA in
that G153 acts as a hinge residue with several internal hydrogen-bonding
interactions forming within the loop during the MD simulation, such
as between T156 and D149, S151 and D149, and R154 and E150. This loop
could play a similar role in PyrH as the equivalent loop 157–159
does in PrnA, acting as a structural link between the FAD-binding
strap and Trp-S. However, the residue S157 from PrnA has no analogous
residue in PyrH; instead, F164 is found in a similar spatial position
and probably fulfills a similar role in hydrogen-bonding Trp-S. After
equilibration, F164 forms stable hydrogen-bonding interactions with
Trp-S amino and carboxylate moieties (SI Figure S19). DCCA of the PyrH full complex (SI Figure S20) shows similar correlations to PrnA (Figure 8, SI Figure S4).

In general, most of the binding interactions between
the protein,
Trp-S, and FAD in PrnA are similar to those in PyrH. For example,
tryptophan is bound in a similar way, i.e., positioned between hydrophobic
side chains, making π–π stacking interactions with
the indole ring (shown in SI Figure S21, Table 2 and SI Table S4). In PrnA, W455 is replaced by a similarly
positioned F451 in PyrH, although the distance is greater (average
distance 7.0 Å), therefore making the interaction weaker and
less significant for tryptophan binding. F49 in PyrH occupies a similar
position to F454 in PrnA, with an average distance of 5.3 Å to
Trp-S (SI Table S4). H101 and F103 from
PrnA are conserved in PyrH as H92 and F94 and fulfill a similar role
as hydrophobic residues in proximity to Trp-S (SI Table S4).

In PyrH, the amino group of Trp-S interacts
electrostatically with
the side chain of E452 (distance of 3.9 Å) (SI Table S5 and Figure S22). In the
crystal structure of PyrH, a similar electrostatic interaction supports
E452 and appears to be created by R96; however, the average distance
of this interaction during the MD simulation is much greater and therefore
weaker than the analogous interaction between K57 and E450 observed
in the MD simulation of PrnA. In PyrH, the important catalytic residue
E354 interacts with the protonated H40 with a similar distance to
that of H395 to E346 seen in PrnA (Table 1 and SI Table S5). Hypochlorous acid forms strong interactions with both the active
site K75 and E354. Low average distances indicate that these interactions
are stronger and more stable than in PrnA (SI Figures S14 and S15). This may be another contributing factor
to the increased efficiency of PyrH as an enzyme.

The greatest
differences in tryptophan binding between PyrH and
PrnA observed in our MD simulations were found in the hydrogen-bonding
interactions between the protein and Trp-S. The different orientations
of the substrate between PrnA and PyrH lead to very different hydrogen
bonding. In PyrH, the relative upside-down positioning of tryptophan
means that the tryptophan NE1 atom no longer points toward hypochlorous
acid channel, meaning it is more able to make hydrogen bonds with
the surface residues of the tryptophan binding pocket (Figures 14 and 15). In PyrH, S345 forms a hydrogen bond with the Trp-S NE1 atom, S50
is the main residue responsible for the hydrogen bonding of Trp-S
carboxylate moiety and F164 forms hydrogen bonds with both amino and
carboxylate moiety of tryptophan (SI Table S3).

Figure 15 Hydrogen-bonding interactions of Trp-S in the PyrH enzyme.

Similarly, in the PrnA MD simulation,
FAD undergoes a structural
transition from a linear to a bent form (SI Figure S8). The transition occurs much more rapidly in PyrH than in
PrnA (SI Figure S18). This is seen in the
loss of several hydrogen bonds in the crystal structure as compared
to the MD simulation (SI Table S6). The
binding mode of FAD in PyrH shows a high level of similarity to that
of PrnA, in that it is mainly bound by backbone hydrogen bonds (SI Figure S23). Some of the interactions between
hydrophobic side chains and the adenine and flavin moieties are conserved
by similar residues to those in PrnA in both the crystal structure
and MD simulations (SI Table S7 and Figure S24).

Correlations to Experimental
Studies
The simulations
of PrnA and PyrH agree with the experimental crystallographic studies
of both enzymes on the structural organization of these enzymes and
the structural basis of their functions. The simulations are consistent
with the crystallographic data for the majority of the interactions
that stabilize the binding of Trp-S and FAD in their respective binding
sites.15,16

Important justification concerning
the nature of the reaction mechanism arises from the observation of
the crystal structure of PrnA and especially by the fact that the
FAD-binding site and tryptophan-binding site are separated by 10 Å.15 Although experimental studies assert that there
is a lack of a potential large conformational transition that brings
into close proximity the two binding sites, they cannot completely
exclude such a possibility. Instead, the MD simulations for 1 μs
of the full complex, apoenzyme form of PrnA, and full complex PyrH
(Figure 12) demonstrate
that there is no such kind of conformational transition that would
bring the two binding sites together and disfavor the reaction mechanism
that involves direct contact between FAD and Trp-S.

The computational
results of the PrnA and PyrH simulations agree
with the experimental studies on the key interactions in the tryptophan-binding
site. The experiments show no activity in PrnA for the K79A mutant
and a 2 order of magnitude reduction of activity for the E346Q mutant,
and our computational studies provide the atomistic details about
these experimental findings. Furthermore, the present simulations
agree with the overall profile of stabilizing interactions in the
FAD-binding site and further explain the role of the strap region
in both enzymes. Furthermore, the present MD studies complement and
agree with previous QM/MM studies on the reaction mechanism of PrnA.22

Conclusions
Applying MD simulations,
atomistic insights into the structure–function
relationships of two halogenases—PrnA and PyrH—were
gained and the origin of their regioselectivity was found to be related
to structural features. The MD study showed that during the 1 μs
time scale, no major conformational change occurs that can bring the
cofactor FAD and the substrate tryptophan binding sites together.
This confirms the feasibility of the reaction mechanism that involves
first formation of hypochlorous acid in the FAD-binding site and then
its transfer to the tryptophan binding site, where the halogenation
reaction takes place. Key residues involved in positioning the substrate
tryptophan in the enzyme active sites were identified. Specific active
site orientation of tryptophan is likely a key factor in the regioselectivity
of the two enzymes. The MD simulations identified several flexible
regions that have implications for substrate binding. A possible function
was proposed for the strap region. Atomistic details about the communication
that links the tryptophan and FAD binding sites were provided. The
study of the two mutant forms of PrnA confirmed the experimental mutagenesis
results and provided a better understanding of the structural basis
for reduced activities observed for these mutants. Analysis of PyrH
and PrnA MD simulations showed that although the two enzymes share
very similar structures, they exhibit fine differences in interactions
in the respective tryptophan-binding sites. These observations suggest
a structural basis for PyrH as a more efficient halogenating enzyme.
