We
discovered four new solvates for naturally sourced allocryptopine.
The new found crystalline forms are isostructural and have similar
crystal structures and packing patterns. However, they exhibit obviously
different fluorescence appearance. In addition, the acetone solvate
SA, N,N-dimethylformamide solvate
SD, and tetrahydrofuran solvate ST also present both luminescent mechanochromic
and hydrochromic properties.

Introduction
Solid-state organic
compounds exhibiting switchable and variable
fluorescence have colossal potential uses in fluorescent switches,1−3 small molecule sensing,4−6 detection of stress,7 and optical devices8 and are attracting more and more attention. Luminescent chromism
is the phenomenon that a material presents a major and reversible
change in photoluminescence color in response to external stimulation.9 The external stimulation includes several factors,
such as heat, pressure, mechanical force, solvent, water, etc. Among
these, the mechanochromism (color changes upon mechanic stimulus)
attracted particular attention and more than 500 reports on the materials
with mechanochromism have been published so far.10 Up to date, several strategies, such as organic synthesis,11−16 polymorphism,17−21 solvate,22−24 and co-crystal,25−29 have been applied to obtain the luminescent mechanochromic
materials. Recently, our group successfully discovered a new naturally
occurring and metal-free organic material with both mechanochromism
and solvatochromism properties by solid form screening.30,31

Except for the mechanochromism, solvatochromism (color changes
upon exposure to different solvents) is another interesting and worthwhile
phenomenon. Hydrochromism is a subclass of solvatochromism, referring
to the reversible color change of a solid in response to external
water molecules. Hydrochromic materials have many applications, such
as monitoring the water content of organic solvents,32 detecting humidity,33,34 use as rewritable paper,35 and mapping human sweat pores.36 Over the past decade, the research on luminescent mechanochromism
or hydrochromism alone has rapidly grown and several studies have
been reported, however, reports on materials that exhibit both luminescent
mechanochromism and hydrochromism are still rare.

Allocryptopine
(ALP, Scheme 1) is
one of the protopinetype alkaloids and has been isolated
from several plants (Papaveraceae, Fumariaceae, Ranunclaceae, and
Rutaceae). It plays an important role in plant defense mechanisms
against biotic stress and has a number of biological effects in mammals.37 Two crystalline forms (α and β)
of ALP have been reported.38,39 Its fluorescence properties
in aqueous and organic solutions were also studied by Kubala, etc.40 However, the luminescent chromic property of
ALP solid state has not been fully studied yet.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structure
of Allocryptopine
In this work, we performed a comprehensive solid-state
screening
on ALP. Four different solvates were uncovered (acetone solvate SA,
tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvate ST, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate SD, and hydrate HG), and the single
crystal structures, physicochemical properties were fully characterized.
Interestingly, these crystals exhibit similar crystal structures and
packing patterns. In addition, both mechano- and solvatochromism were
observed among various crystalline forms.

Results and Discussion
To discover suitable luminescent chromic crystals, comprehensive
crystallization screening experiments were conducted with a variety
of solvents and crystallization methods. Four different crystalline
forms of ALP were obtained. Acetone solvate SA, THF solvate ST, and N,N-dimethylformamide solvate SD could
all be prepared by slow evaporation or slurrying in ALP acetone, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), and N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) solutions, respectively. Hydrate HG could be obtained by vacuum-drying
the acetone solvate SA, THF solvate ST, and DMF solvate SD and then
keeping them under high relative humidity (RH) condition (>90%).
The
obtained crystallized samples were fully characterized by X-ray powder
diffraction (XRPD) analysis (Figure 1). The results show that all solvates and hydrates
exhibit similar XRPD patterns, indicating they are isostructural solvates.
In addition, the experimental XRPD data of these solvates were in
accordance with their single-crystal stimulated ones from their corresponding
single-crystal structures. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
was also used to distinguish these four isomorphic crystals. As shown
in Figure S1, THF solvate ST and hydrate
HG present very similar FTIR spectra and crystalline forms SA and
SD exhibit distinct IR curves. Different from ST and HG, acetone solvate
SA and DMF solvate SD show obvious signals for carbonyl C=O
stretching vibration corresponding (1712 cm–1 for
SA and 1681 cm–1 for SD) to the carbonyl group in
their contained solvent acetone and DMF molecules.

Figure 1 XRPD patterns of ALP
solvates.

The stability of ALP crystalline
forms was assessed by detailed
thermal analyses (Figure S2). Apparent
one-step water mass loss could be seen in the thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) thermogram, and the weight loss results were determined as 7.6,
9.3, 9.2, and 4.3% for acetone solvate SA, THF solvate ST, DMF solvate
SD, and hydrate HG, respectively. The water content of HG was redetermined
by the Karl Fischer (KF, 4.5%) method. Accordingly, the three solvates
could be assigned as hemi-acetone (calculated 7.3%), hemi-DMF (calculated
9.0%), and hemi-THF (calculated 8.8%) solvates, with monohydrate (calculated
4.6%). In addition, the solvent stoichiometry of acetone solvate SA,
THF solvate ST, and DMF solvate SD was further confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray diffraction (SCXRD). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
curves revealed a wide endothermic peak for the solvent release for
each crystal. The DSC endotherm signals also echoed the weight loss
steps in the TGA diagrams.

Fluorescent color differences among
ALP crystals were characterized
by solid-state fluorescent spectra (SFS) analysis (Figure 2). The different colors and
maximum emission wavelengths were exhibited in ALP solvates’
SFS diagrams. Under UV excitation (λex = 365 nm),
THF solvate ST had a violet color and exhibited a photoluminescence
peak at 444 nm. Acetone solvate SA and DMF solvate SD presented similar
maximum emission wavelengths (452.8 nm for SA and 451.4 nm for SD).
However, they showed obviously different emission appearances: SA
had a wathet blue tint, and SD exhibited a royal blue color. Among
the four crystalline forms, the hydrate HG had the longest emission
wavelength (491 nm) and it presented a green appearance. The solid-state
UV–vis absorption characteristics of these materials are plotted
in Figure 3. The four
solvates show differences in λmax (310 nm for hydrate
HG, 312 nm for acetone solvate SA, 217 and 317 nm for DMF solvate
SD, and 304 nm for THF solvate ST). Interestingly, different from
the other three crystals, SD presents one more peak at 217 nm, corresponding
to the absorption of the included solvent DMF.

spectra (SFS, left) and digital images
of ALP powder taken under 365 nm UV irradiation (right).

Figure 3 Solid-state UV–vis spectra of ALP solvates.

To obtain insight into the emission
mechanism of ALP, we prepared
and analyzed single crystals of acetone solvate SA, THF solvate ST,
and DMF solvate SD. The crystallographic data of these crystalline
forms are summarized in Table 1. These solvates have similar unit cell parameters. They crystallize
in both P21/n space group monoclinic system. The difference
is in the angles (109.686(2) for SA, 110.100(5) for SD, and 111.1380(10)
for ST, respectively). The crystal structure analysis shows that the
three crystals present similar packing patterns (Figure 4), confirming that they are
isostructural. In addition, in all three solvates, there is no hydrogen
bond among ALP molecules (Figure S3). The
main intermolecular interactions are π–π interactions.
The π–π interactions in acetone solvate SA, THF
solvate ST, and DMF solvate SD are shown in Figure 4. Between the two neighboring ALP molecules,
the centroid-to-plane and centroid-to-centroid distances are 5.103
and 3.474 Å in SA, 5.100 and 3.513 Å in SD, and 5.202 and
3.491 Å in ST, respectively. The three crystalline forms present
similar centroid-to-plane distances. SA and SD also exhibit nearly
identical centroid-to-centroid distances. Hence, SA and SD have similar
maximum emission wavelengths. In comparison, ST has the longest centroid-to-centroid
distance, indicating that ALP molecules in ST pack less compactly
and have weaker π–π interactions. It was well known
that crystal phases with stronger π–π interactions
show maximum emission at a longer wavelength region, whereas those
with relatively weaker π–π interactions exhibit
maximum emission at a shorter wavelength region. As a result, ST exhibits
the shortest maximum emission wavelength.

The electronic structures of acetone solvate SA, THF
solvate ST,
and DMF solvate SD are theoretically calculated by density functional
theory (DFT). The single-crystal structure data was used for calculation
without any structural optimization. The roles between ALP and its
neighboring solvent molecules were demonstrated by importing all molecules
in the unit cell. Figure 5 illustrates the representative molecular orbital amplitude
plots of the three crystalline forms and gives all electronic structures
for comparison. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) of
solvate SD are fully located within the solvent DMF molecules, and
the HOMOs of solvates SA and ST are fully located within the ALP molecules.
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of SD and ST are
both distributed on the solvents DMF and THF molecules, respectively.
In comparison, the LUMOs of crystal SA are also mainly located within
its included solvent acetone molecules. The difference is that, for
SA, there are few LUMOs located within the ALP molecules. The theoretical
band gaps for SD, SA, and ST are 0.22, 0.48, and 0.52 eV, respectively.
The lowest band gap in SD suggests the longest emission wavelength,
and the highest band gap in ST suggests the shortest emission wavelength.

LUMO frontier molecular orbitals of the three solvates
at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) levels.

Interestingly, it could be found that the emission behavior
of
the four solvates has something to do with the polarities of their
included solvents. The polarity trend of the four included solvents
is water > DMF > acetone > THF, and the trend of the emission
wavelength
is hydrate HG > DMF solvate SD > acetone solvate SA > THF
solvate
ST. Obviously, the emission colors were bathochromically shifted with
the solvent polarity increasing. The bathochromic shift implied the
existence of the intramolecular charge-transfer state. Such conclusion
is consistent with the calculation results.

Mechanochromism and Hydrochromism
To study the luminescent
mechanochromic properties of the four crystalline forms, all solvates
were ground by a ball mill and the results are presented in Figure 6. The results show
that, after grinding, the acetone solvate SA, DMF solvate SD, and
THF solvate ST exhibit prominent mechanochromism. For example, the
emission color of violet ST gradually turned cyan as the milling time
went on. The mechanochromic processes were also verified by the solid-state
fluorescent spectra (Figure S4). Upon grinding,
the maximum emission wavelength λem,max of ST is
bathochromically shifted to about 471.2 nm and the corresponding Δλem,max is 27.2 nm. Interestingly, after grinding, the other
two solvates SA and SD also changed to cyan AmS. All three luminescent
mechanochromic processes are reversible. The obtained blue green AmS
could be converted back to SA, SD, and ST by slurrying in acetone,
DMF and THF, respectively. In comparison, the hydrate HG only shows
little changes of its photoluminescence color upon grinding. Its emission
color was changed from green to pale green. In addition, this process
is irreversible and the obtained pale green AmH could not be transformed
to HG by slurrying.

Figure 6 Mechanochromism for the solvates of ALP.

To gain insights into the mechanism for the mechanochromism,
X-ray
powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis of the four crystalline forms was
conducted before and after milling. The results indicated that the
mechanochromism is based on crystalline-to-amorphous phase transitions.
The XRPD pattern of powdered samples of the four crystals showed intense
diffraction peaks (Figure S5). In contrast,
the XRPD analyses of the ground powders revealed featureless patterns,
indicating the presence of an amorphous phase. The crystallinity of
the amorphous state could be largely improved by the reverting back
processes discussed above, accompanied with the emergence of similar
sharp diffraction peaks and different emission colors, lending evidence
to the presumption that the changing of the included solvents raised
the different emission properties.

Luminescent hydrochromic
properties of the discovered crystalline
forms were investigated by treatment with water under various conditions.
The results show that acetone solvate SA, THF solvate ST, and DMF
solvate SD all exhibit obviously luminescent hydrochromic properties.
For example, exposure of blue powder SD to water vapor causes obvious
color changes. After 10 min, part of SD on the periphery was quickly
converted to white and nearly all of the SD powder could be transformed
to white by fuming with water vapor for 3 h (Figure 7). This white powder could be finally transited
to green after 3 days by keeping in the water vapor. To understand
the mechanism for this hydrochromism, the transition process was also
checked by XRPD and FTIR (Figures S6 and S7). The results show that, during this conversion, the XRPD of SD
remained unchanged. For FTIR, the peak of O–H stretching vibration
at 3150–3700 cm–1 gradually turned stronger
as the steaming time went on, indicating the growing of water content.
Meanwhile, the peak at 1712 cm–1 corresponding to
the carbonyl group on DMF molecule remained. Similar XRPD patterns
and microchanged FTIR spectra before and after hydration clearly reveal
that the emission color changes induced by water treatment result
from alterations of the water contents. The other two solvates SA
and ST could be converted to green hydrate HG (Figure S8) as well. These conversions are reversible, and
the obtained green HG could be reconverted back to SA, SD, and ST
by slurrying in acetone, DMF, and THF, respectively.

SD of ALP.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, three new solvates and one hydrate of natural sourced
alkaloid allocryptopine were discovered by comprehensive crystallization
screening experiments with a variety of solvents and crystallization
methods. The four crystalline forms show similar XRPD patterns, indicating
that they are isostructural related. The crystal structures of the
three solvates are disclosed by SCXRD, and the data analysis show
that they have similar unit cell parameters and packing patterns.
The luminescent properties of these four isostructural crystals were
investigated under UV irradiation. These isomorphic crystalline forms
exhibit significantly different fluorescent colors: acetone solvate
SA is wathet blue, DMF solvate SD is royal blue, THF solvate ST is
violet, and hydrate HG presents a green color. Finally, the luminescent
chromism for these solids was studied and the three solvates exhibit
both mechanochromism and hydrochromism properties.
