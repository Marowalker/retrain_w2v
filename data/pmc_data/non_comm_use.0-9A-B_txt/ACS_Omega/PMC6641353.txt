This
study adopts a simple but facile process for preparing silver-doped
magnetic nanoparticles by the spontaneous oxidation–reduction/coprecipitation
method. The preparation can be achieved in one pot with a single step,
and the prepared silver-doped magnetic nanoparticles were utilized
as nanocatalysts for the reduction of o-nitroaniline.
Utilizing the magnetic characteristics of the prepared nanoparticles,
the catalytic reactions can be carried out under quasi-homogeneous
condition and the nanocatalysts can be easily collected after the
conversion is achieved. It can be revealed from the results that the
morphologies and the composition of the prepared silver-doped magnetic
nanoparticles can be adjusted by changing the conditions during the
production, which affects the efficacy of the catalysis. In addition,
the catalysis efficiency is also controlled by the pH, temperature,
and the amounts of nanocatalysts used during the catalytic reaction.
Finally, the silver-doped magnetic nanocatalysts prepared in this
study own the advantages of easy preparation, room-temperature catalysis,
high conversion ability, and recyclability, which make them more applicable
in real utilities.

Introduction
In contrast to bulk
silver, nanometric silver materials exhibit
many extraordinary properties such as a high surface-to-volume ratio,1,2 quantum tunneling effects,3,4 an abundance of free
electrons,5 surface plasmon resonance,2,6−8 and antibacterial behaviors.9,10 Because
of these unique properties, noble silver nanomaterials are widely
applied in diverse areas, including thermotherapy,5,11 medicine,2,5,12 sensors,13−16 surface-enhanced spectroscopy,6,17−20 biology,2 catalysis,21−28 and electronics.29−31 Among these many applications, the catalysis of the
reduction of nitroarenes to aromatic amines is increasingly attracting
attention because of pharmaceutical needs and the importance of this
industry.25,26,32−38 Various strategies have been proposed to reduce nitroarenes more
efficiently and more rapidly using silver nanomaterials. These strategies
include depositing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on supports used as
heterogeneous catalysts,24,26,39−42 combining AgNPs with reduced graphene oxide or graphene oxide as
catalysts,43−47 and using silver nanocolloids as a quasi-homogeneous nanocatalyst.25,33,48−54 All of the aforementioned catalytic approaches are efficient and
selective. However, the reaction rate for heterogeneous catalysis
is rather low and quasi-homogeneous catalysis suffers from possible
aggregation of the nanocatalyst. Furthermore, the procedures for preparing
such nanocatalysts are somewhat complex and time-consuming.

Applications of magnetic nanoparticles have also been extensively
investigated in recent years because they feature many notable characteristics,
such as a high surface-to-volume ratio, easy attraction and redispersion,
and paramagnetism. Because of these crucial properties and advantages,
the combination of AgNPs and magnetic nanoparticles has become one
of the most favorable approaches for the catalytic reduction of nitroarenes.55−60 In this study, a simple but facile method was applied in a single
step to prepare silver-doped magnetic nanoparticles (AgMNPs) for the
catalytic reduction of nitroarenes through spontaneous oxidation–reduction
and coprecipitation. When mixing Fe2+ with Ag+, a spontaneous reaction is caused by the difference in standard
reduction potential between the ionic species. When Ag+ is reduced to Ag0, an equivalent number of moles of Fe2+ ions are simultaneously oxidized to Fe3+. After
the addition of precipitation agents, AgNPs were coprecipitated with
iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles, which led to the formation of AgMNPs.
The proposed preparation can be achieved in a single step, and the
prepared AgMNPs can subsequently be utilized as nanocatalysts for
the reduction of o-nitroaniline (o-NA). The parameters (pH, temperature, and amount of nanocatalyst)
that affect the morphology and composition of the prepared AgMNPs
and efficiencies of the catalytic reduction were systematically studied
to gain a greater understanding of the characteristics of the AgMNPs
prepared using the method proposed in this study. Additionally, the
catalytic activity of the AgMNPs prepared for the reduction of other
nitroarenes and their recyclability were investigated to fully evaluate
their potential for practical applications.

Results and Discussion
Effect
of Oxidation–Reduction Time on AgMNP Preparation
Figure S1 shows the typical measured
hysteresis loops of the prepared AgMNPs, which confirmed that the
prepared AgMNPs were paramagnetic and usable for further applications. Figure 1 depicts the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of AgMNPs obtained using various
reaction times. From the images, dark-sphere-like Ag nanoparticles
were mixed with light-colored Fe3O4 NPs because
Ag has a higher electron density that allows fewer electrons to transmit.61,62 The AgNPs formed after a 10 min reaction time were larger than those
formed after a 2 min reaction time. Notably, the size of the Fe3O4 NPs was mostly unaffected by the reaction time.

of (a) 2 min, (b) 8 min, and (c)–(f) 10 min, where the [Fe2+]0 to [Ag+]0 ratios are
(a)–(c) 3:1, (d) 2:1, (e) 4:1, and (f) 6:1. [Fe2+]0 are all 12 mM, and the magnifications of the images
are all 100 000×. The yellow arrows indicate the examples
of AgNPs for each sample.

Figure 2a
shows
the evolution of the UV–vis spectra for the reduction of o-NA catalyzed by AgMNPs over time. The absorbance peak
at 412 nm, which corresponds to the characteristic o-NA peak,63 decreased as the reaction
proceeded. The variations of the spectra indicated that o-NA was reduced to 1,2-phenylenediamine (1,2-PPD).41,64 The relative concentration (Ct/C0) of o-NA was obtained by
dividing the absorbance recorded at 412 nm at the specified time (Ct) by the absorbance at 412 nm before the addition
of AgMNPs (C0). The results in Figure 2b were plotted using
various AgMNPs prepared using various reduction durations. In Figure 2b, the catalytic
efficiency of the AgMNPs shows no significant difference between when
the reaction time was 4–10 min and when more than 95% of o-NA was reduced within 240 s. This finding suggests remarkable
catalytic activity. By contrast, achieving the same conversion percentage
required more than 500 s when the reaction time to prepare the AgMNPs
was 2 or 12 min. Because the catalytic efficiency of nanocatalysts
depends on their size and the amount of catalyst loaded,26 we concluded that the reaction time to achieve
the optimal morphology and catalyst loading was 10 min. For comparison,
the results of an experiment conducted in parallel, where AgMNPs were
replaced with Fe3O4 NPs, are also plotted in Figure 2b, showing that the
reduction of o-NA can proceed only when AgNPs are
doped. In the absence of AgNPs, the reduction of o-NA is suspended.

in (a). Parallel experiment (□) uses 20 mg of Fe3O4 NPs as nanocatalysts, where the other conditions are
the same as described as (a).

Effect of Fe2+/Ag+ on AgMNP Preparation
As described in the previous section, catalytic efficiency is related
to the size and amount of doped AgNPs. In addition, we expected the
morphology and amount of doped AgNPs to be affected by the ratio of
initial concentration of Fe2+ to Ag+ because
AgNO3 acts as the oxidation agent in the formation of AgMNPs. Figure 1 shows the TEM images
of the AgMNPs with different ratios of [Fe2+]0 to [Ag+]0. The images reveal that the morphologies
of the AgNPs are similar. Figure S2 shows
the typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the prepared AgMNPs
and illustrates that the locations and intensity of the diffraction
peaks were consistent with the standard patterns for JCPDS card no.
(79-0417) magnetite and JPCPDS card no. (4-0783) standard Ag crystal.
The size of AgNPs can by estimated using the Scherrer equation, and
all AgNPs are approximately 20 nm.10 To
further explore the effect of the initial Fe2+ to Ag+ concentration ratio, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis was performed and the typical spectra for the AgMNPs
are shown in Figure S3A. The atomic percentages
of Ag, Fe, and O for various initial concentration ratios of Fe2+ to Ag+ obtained through EDS are plotted in Figure S3B, which shows that the atomic percentage
of Ag increased as the initial concentration ratio of Fe2+ to Ag+ decreased. When the initial concentration ratio
of Fe2+ to Ag+ was 2.0, the atomic percentage
of Ag in the AgMNPs was 8.23%. The atomic percentage decreased to
0.76% when the initial concentration ratio of Fe2+ to Ag+ was 6.0.

Figure 3 plots the Ct/C0 of o-NA as a function of the reduction
time in the presence of AgMNPs prepared with various ratios of [Fe2+]0 to [Ag+]0. The figure
shows that the AgMNPs prepared with a smaller ratio of [Fe2+]0 to [Ag+]0 had a higher catalytic
efficiency. Through correlation with the EDS results, we concluded
that the highest catalytic efficiency was obtained for the highest
AgNP loading. Notably, although the catalytic efficiency of the AgMNPs
was even higher when the initial concentration ratio of Fe2+ to Ag+ was 1.5, the yield of AgMNPs was very low because
of weak magnetization and most particles formed after the coprecipitation
stage could not be collected by the magnet. Similar results were observed
when the initial concentration ratio of Fe2+ to Ag+ was 6.0. Therefore, we can conclude that the initial concentration
ratio of Fe2+ to Ag+ should be between 2 and
3 to ensure that a sufficient amount of Fe2+ is oxidized
so that the ratio of Fe2+ to Fe3+ is close to
2 before the coprecipitation agent is added to form magnetic Fe3O4 NPs.65

1.5:1, where the other conditions are the same as described in Figure 2a.

Effects of pH and Temperature on the Catalytic
Reaction
The acceleration of the reduction reaction by AgMNPs
originates in
a relay between the nucleophile and electrophile.39 Therefore, the catalyzed reduction rate is affected by
the abundance of electrons in the reaction system. To observe the
relationship between the electron abundance and reaction rate, the
catalysis reaction was performed at various pH values. The relative o-NA concentration (Ct/C0) was recorded as a function of reaction time
at various pH values, and the results are plotted in Figure 4a. The pH played a key role
in the catalysis reaction; when the pH was 9.8, the reduction of o-NA was completed within 4 min. The reduction rate significantly
decreased when the pH was set to 8.8 and less than 85% of o-NA was reduced after approximately 5 min of reaction.
When the pH was lower than 8, almost no conversion of o-NA could be observed. Because the acceleration of the reduction
reaction by AgMNPs originates in a relay between the nucleophile and
electrophile,39 alkaline conditions enriched
the electron densities on the AgNP surfaces by adsorbing more OH–, which promoted the reduction of o-NA. When the pH was set to 10.8, the reduction of o-NA decelerated, possibly because of the formation of yellow-colored
2,3-diaminophenazine under extremely alkaline conditions.66

time in
the presence of 30 mM NaBH4 under different pHs of (■)
6.8, (●) 7.8, (▲) 8.8, (▼) 9.8, and (◆)
10.8, where the other conditions are the same as described in Figure 2a. (b) Ct/C0 of 1 mM o-NA versus catalytic reduction time in the presence of 30 mM NaBH4 under different temperatures of (■) 0 °C, (●)
25 °C, and (▲) 40 °C, where the other conditions
are the same as described in Figure 2a.

The reaction rate was
affected by the temperature of the reaction
system because the reactants had more kinetic energy at higher temperatures
and were able to cross the activation state more easily. Figure 4b depicts the relationship
between Ct/C0 and reaction times at various reaction temperatures. As shown in Figure 4b, the higher the
temperature of the reaction system, the faster was the observed reduction
of o-NA. Furthermore, when the temperature was 0
°C, the reduction rate of o-NA was similar to
that at 25 °C in the first minute and Ct/C0 was almost unchanged after
the first minute, suggesting that the reduction was almost interrupted
after 1 min at 0 °C.

Effect of the Catalyst Amount on the Catalytic
Reaction
As described in the previous sections, the conversion
efficiency
is related to the amount of AgNP loading. Accordingly, the conversion
efficiency can also be related to the amount of AgMNPs used per experiment. Figure 5 plots the relationship
between the Ct/C0 of o-NA and reduction time when various
amounts of AgMNPs were used. As shown in Figure 5, when 1 mg of AgMNPs was used per experiment,
approximately 20% of o-NA was reduced after 5 min
of conversion and the conversion efficiency increased with the amount
of AgMNPs used. When 20 mg of AgMNPs was used per experiment, the
conversion of o-NA was almost 100% within 250 s at
room temperature, which is promising for further applications.

as described in Figure 2a.

Activity of AgMNPs for
the Catalytic Reduction of Other Nitroarenes
After studying
the characteristics and catalytic properties of
the prepared AgMNPs, we investigated the catalytic reduction of other
nitroarenes, including m-NA, p-NA,
and p-NP, through the same procedures to investigate
the ability of the AgMNPs to accelerate the reduction of other nitroarenes. Figure S4 plots the evolution of the UV–vis
spectra for reducing m-NA, p-NA,
and p-NP in the presence of AgMNPs over time. The
absorption maxima, which were located at 360 nm for m-NA, 380 nm for p-NA, and 400 nm for p-NP, decreased as the catalytic reduction proceeded. The relationship
between Ct/C0, where C0 is the absorbance at the initial
time and Ct is the absorbance after the
specific reaction time, for the nitroarenes tested and the reaction
time under optimal conditions is plotted in Figure 6. As indicated in the figure, the reductions
of the four nitroarenes examined in this study were all completed
within 4 min, which suggested that the AgMNPs prepared in this study
were capable of catalytically reducing various nitroarenes.

presence of 30 mM NaBH4 and 20 mg of AgMNPs (■) o-NA, (●) m-NA (358 nm), (▲) p-NA (380 nm), and (▼) p-NP (400
nm), where the other conditions are the same as described in Figure 2a.

Furthermore, as reported in other works, the catalytic
reduction
of nitroarenes follows the pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics.26,43,51 The linear relations between
ln(C0/Ct)
of nitroarenes examined in this study against reaction time were obtained
and the rate constant (k) can be estimated by calculating
the slopes of the obtained lines. The calculated k values at room temperature are 0.0192, 0.0145, 0.0185, and 0.0196
s–1 for the catalytic reduction of o-NA, m-NA, p-NA, and p-NP, respectively. To compare the results obtained in this study
to those reported recently, Table 1 tabulates the catalytic activities of various AgNP-based
catalytic systems. As can be observed in the table, the rate constants
of AgMNPs prepared in this study for the reduction of nitroarenes
are as good as other reported nanocatalysts. Moreover, because the
effects of temperatures have also been studied in the previous sections,
the thermodynamic parameters for the catalytic reduction of o-NA by AgMNPs prepared in this study can be calculated
by following the Arrhenius and Eyring equations.67,68 The calculated
activation energy (Ea) is 39.88 kJ/mol,
activation enthalpy (ΔH) is 37.34 kJ/mol, and
activation entropy (ΔS) is −123.29 J/(mol
K). These results suggest that the AgMNPs prepared in this study are
excellent nanocatalysts for the reduction of nitroarenes. The catalytic
reduction of nitroarenes by metal nanoparticles is generally explained
by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, where both reactants
are adsorbed on nanocatalyst surfaces and reaction occurred after
the adsorption.67,68 As a result of conversion, products
are formed and then desorb from nanocatalyst surfaces. According to
the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, the rate of catalytic reduction
depends on the surface coverage reducing agent and nitroarene molecules.69−71 This mechanism rationalizes the large rate constant and small activation
energy obtained in this study because the high surface-to-volume ratio
and the quasi-homogeneous reaction conditions increase the surface
coverage of reactants significantly.

Recyclability of the Ag Nanocatalysts
The recyclability
of the AgMNPs prepared in this study was evaluated by consecutively
reusing the nanocatalysts for the catalytic reduction of o-NA. As shown in Figure 7, only approximately 40% of o-NA was reduced
to 1,2-PPD after 10 min of reaction in the second consecutive test.
This is possibly related to the adsorption of o-NA
or 1,2-PPD on the surface of the silver nanocatalysts, which consequently
reduced the electron transferability.26 To reactivate the silver nanocatalysts, we soaked the used AgMNPs
in an aqueous solution at pH 3 for 20 min and rinsed them with neutral
water before the next use. As shown in Figure 7, more than 90% of the o-NA was reduced within 5 min and more than 95% was reduced within
8 min. Furthermore, after treating the reused AgMNPs with an aqueous
acidic solution, the AgMNPs could be recycled and their performance
was similar to that in the previous run. Therefore, the AgMNPs prepared
in this study can be recycled after treatment with an acidic solution,
which significantly extends the practical applicability of these silver
nanocatalysts.

are the same as described in Figure 2a.

Conclusions
In
this study, a simple but facile approach to prepare silver-doped
magnetic hybrid nanoparticles was proposed based on a chemical reduction
and coprecipitation method. The nanoparticles prepared through this
method were used as nanocatalysts for the reduction of o-NA. Using the AgMNPs prepared in this study as nanocatalysts exploits
the advantages of quasi-homogeneous reaction conditions and enables
the easy removal of nanocatalysts from the solution with a magnet.
The results indicated that the composition of the AgMNPs prepared
can be tuned by adjusting the ratio of [Fe2+]0 to [Ag+]0 and the chemical reduction time
during the production of AgMNPs. During the catalytic reduction of o-NA, the pH and temperature of the system affect the reduction
rate, which is also affected by the amount of nanocatalyst used in
the reaction. Furthermore, the prepared AgMNPs were applicable to
the catalytic reduction of other nitroarenes. Finally, the silver-doped
magnetic nanocatalysts proposed in this study have several advantages,
namely, easy preparation, significant catalytic activity at room temperature,
high conversion ability, and recyclability, all of which enhance their
usefulness for real applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
Ferrous sulfate and ferric chloride were
obtained from Showa Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). Silver nitrate, o-NA, m-nitroaniline (m-NA), p-nitroaniline (p-NA), and p-nitrophenol (p-NP) were purchased from
Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). Sodium borohydride was obtained from Acros
Organics (Geel, Belgium). Ammonium hydroxide (28–30%, v/v)
and nitric acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Hampton, NH).
All chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received without further
purification. Deionized Milli-Q water (Simplicity, Millipore, Burlington,
MA) was used throughout this study.

Preparation of AgMNPs
The preparation of AgMNPs was
based on a chemical reduction and coprecipitation method. Briefly,
100 mL of 12 mM ferrous aqueous solution was mixed with various volumes
of 200 mM silver nitrate aqueous solution under vigorous stirring
for a specified amount of time. During stirring, a spontaneous oxidation–reduction
reaction occurred between Ag+ and Fe2+. Ag+ was reduced to Ag0 and an equivalent number of
moles of Fe2+ ions were oxidized to Fe3+. After
the specified reaction time, 50 mL of 1.44 M ammonia solution, which
acted as the precipitating agent, was rapidly added to the solution
under vigorous stirring for 10 min to complete the coprecipitation
process. After 3 h in storage, the formed nanoparticles were collected
with a magnet and washed three times with distilled water and ethanol.
Finally, the washed AgMNPs were dried in an oven at 140 °C for
8 h before further use. As an alternative for comparison, magnetite
nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) without silver doping
were prepared following previous reports.72 We conducted transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a Hitachi
HT-7700 microscope operated at 100 kV, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis with a Hitachi SU-8010 microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 15.0 kV, and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with a Siemens
D5000 XRD system to characterize the morphologies and compositions
of the prepared AgMNPs. Hysteresis loops of the prepared AgMNPs were
recorded at room temperature with a Quantum Design MPMS 3 SQUID vibrating
sample magnetometer system.

Reduction of Nitroaniline Catalyzed by AgMNPs
The catalytic
efficiency of the AgMNPs was evaluated using the nanoparticles as
prepared for the catalytic reduction of o-NA. A specific
amount of AgMNPs was mixed with 15 mL of an aqueous solution consisting
of 1 mM o-NA and 30 mM NaBH4 at room temperature.
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra of the solution
were recorded at chosen intervals. All UV–vis spectra in this
study were measured using a Thermo Fisher Scientific Genesys 10S Bio
UV–Vis spectrometer with a 1 nm resolution. The spectra were
recorded within a wavelength range of 250–550 nm. The optical
path of the UV–vis cell was 3 mm.
