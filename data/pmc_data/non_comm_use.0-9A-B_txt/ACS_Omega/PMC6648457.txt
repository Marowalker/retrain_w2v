A novel
fluorescence probe, HBTSeSe, was designed and synthesized
for the detection of H2S with a double-switch mechanism
of a broken diselenide bond followed by thiolysis of ether. Then,
2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT) was released as fluorophore,
which has large Stokes shift based on the excited state intramolecular
proton transfer process. The probe responded selectively and rapidly
to H2S, with the fluorescence increased by 47-fold immediately
after the addition of H2S. HBTSeSe was able to detect H2S in the cytoplasm, specifically in cell imaging experiments.
The results also showed that H2S was produced in the immune
response of RAW264.7 cells activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate.

Introduction
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has long been recognized as an
odorous and toxic compound.1,2 However, it has recently
been found that H2S can be produced in cells. Intracellular
H2S is produced from cysteine (Cys) and cysteine derivatives
through enzymatic pathways, where cystathionine γ-lyase and
cystathionine β-synthase are usually involved.3 H2S participates in cellular signal transduction
as well as antioxidation, thus contributing to the regulation of energy
production, apoptosis, and redox homeostasis of cells.4 On the other hand, aberrant production of H2S is proved to be connected with a variety of diseases such as diabetes,
Down’s syndrome, and Alzheimer’s disease.5−7 Therefore, it is important to monitor the endogenous H2S concentration. However, in biological systems, the physiological
features of H2S include low concentration, high reactivity,
and short lifetime. Therefore, it is still a huge challenge to determine
the intracellular concentration of H2S.

Several methods
have been used to detect H2S.8−11 Tang et al.12 developed a chemoselective-reduction-based
fluorescence probe for the detection of hydrogen sulfide in living
cells, and the effect of pH on the probe was also investigated; Wang
et al.31 developed a new metal-oxide sensor
for detecting hydrogen sulfide gas at room temperature; Long et al.14 used silver nanoparticles to trace H2S by resonance light scattering technique. However, fluorescent probes
represent powerful tools for detecting H2S in living cells
due to latter’s sensitivity and noninvasive property.33 A variety of fluorescent probes have been developed
based on the selective reaction of H2S with azides,28,29 azamacrocyclic Cu(II) complexes,15 and
H2S-specific electrophiles.16 Organic compounds containing selenium have been developed for many
years, and some work in fluorescence probe field has been reported.13,17 Peng et al.22 reported a unique phenyl
diselenide-ester compound, which has the ability to be highly selective
and rapid for H2S detection based on the double-switch
recognition mechanism. Designing fluorescent probes for detecting
H2S based on nucleophilic attack reaction between H2S and Se–Se bond has been a sophisticated strategy.19 However, the nucleophilic reaction rate between
H2S and diselenides would be 105 times faster
than that between H2S and disulfides.20,22 It can be speculated that diselenide groups represent ideal candidates
for recognition center for the design of fluorescence probes that
could respond to H2S rapidly. Since the pKa value of H2S (ca. 7.0) was much lower than
that of other cellular thiols such as cysteine and glutathione (GSH)
(≥8.5), the nucleophilic reaction between H2S and
Se–Se bond was considered to be superior then that of thiols.23 To minimize the possible interference from thiols,
a further switch that utilized the reactivity of the second sulfhydryl
group of H2S for liberating the fluorescence molecule was
adopted. Excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) is a
phototautomerization occurring in the electronic excited state of
a molecule, where a heterocyclic ring is formed by the intramolecular
hydrogen bond between a hydroxyl group and a neighboring proton acceptor.27,32 Moreover, 2-(2′-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT) is a typical
ESIPT chromophore, which has attracted much attention in the fluorescence
probe field by taking advantage of a large Stokes shift.30 These probes were used to capture and visualize
H2S in living cells and have greatly facilitated the study
of H2S biology. However, intracellular production and metabolization
of H2S are very fast and the self-absorption phenomenon
would have an effect on the fluorescence signal, indicating the demand
for selective, rapid, and large Stokes shift fluorescence probes for
the real-time detection of H2S.

Herein, we report
the design, synthesis, and biological applications
of a fluorescence probe with selective and rapid response toward H2S, and a large Stokes shift is achieved. The probe, named
HBTSeSe, was designed by using a diselenide group for recognizing
and capturing H2S and an ESIPT mechanism for switching
the fluorescence, so it has a large Stokes shift.18 It should be noted that the reaction between HBTSeSe and
biothiols cannot turn the fluorescence on; therefore, the selectivity
of HBTSeSe is found to be excellent. Besides, the reaction of a nucleophilic
attack by H2S at selenium is both kinetically much faster
and thermodynamically more favorable.20 A 47-fold enhancement in the fluorescence can be observed immediately
after the addition of H2S to the probe solutions. The results
also showed that the probe can detect endogenous H2S in
the cytoplasm in the immune response of RAW264.7 cells.

Results and Discussion
Design
and Synthesis of HBTSeSe
The design of HBTSeSe
relied on the fast nucleophilic attack on selenium by H2S. In this regard, an ester group was introduced in the ortho position
of selenium (Scheme 1). For comprehending the fluorescence mechanism, ESIPT with a large
Stokes shift was prepared. Furthermore, HBT was selected as the signal
transducer for preparing HBTSeSe. By this design, HBTSeSe was expected
to respond to H2S selectively and rapidly and produce a
strong ESIPT fluorescence in response to H2S due to the
production of HBT. The ESIPT chromophores (HBT) with an intramolecular
hydrogen bond existed in the cis enol form at the ground state. Under
photoexcitation, the singlet excited state of the enol form is populated.
It is worth noting that no geometry relaxation occurs during the excitation,
which is consistent with the Franck–Condon principle. Then,
an ultrafast ESIPT process occurs, and the cis-keto form at the singlet
excited state is formed. The structure of cis-ketones is more stable
due to the existence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Since the ESIPT
is much faster than the fluorescence process (radiative decay), the
observed fluorescence of HBT originated from the keto tautomer.21 However, the ESIPT fluorescence will be inhibited
in HBTSeSe because the phenolic hydroxyl of the HBT unit was esterified.
HBTSeSe was synthesized via a 5-step route as demonstrated in Scheme S1. The synthetic procedure is described
in the Supporting information in detail.
The overall yield of HBTSeSe was 12.8%.

of HBTSeSe toward H2S Based on the
Double-Switch Recognition Mechanism and ESIPT Fluorescence Emission
Property
Fluorescence Response of
HBTSeSe to H2S
The fluorescence response of the
HBTSeSe toward H2S was
investigated under simulated physiological pH (phosphate-buffered
saline, PBS, pH 7.4 and 100 mM). As expected, HBTSeSe exhibited negligible
fluorescence due to the inhibition of ESIPT process. However, the
fluorescence at 460 nm increased when H2S was added to
PBS containing 10 μM HBTSeSe. In the presence of 10 μM
H2S, the fluorescence intensity immediately increased by
47-fold (Figure 1).
It was found that the fluorescence intensity was linear to H2S concentration in the range of 0–10 μM. The regression
equation was y = 64 174x +
65 300, with a linear coefficient of 0.98 (Figure S2). The high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) analysis
of the assay solution containing HBTSeSe and H2S revealed
a new peak of m/z 228.0473, clearly
indicating the formation of free HBT (Figure S7). These results demonstrated that the fluorescence intensity of
HBTSeSe could be used to quantify the H2S concentrations.

spectra (λex = 380 nm) of HBTSeSe (10
μM) in the presence of different concentrations of H2S in aqueous (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/PBS = 1:1, v/v) under ambient
conditions.

Selectivity of HBTSeSe
Differentiation of H2S from the coexisting species is
important for the application of
HBTSeSe in complex biological samples. Therefore, a variety of biologically
relevant species including thiols (Cys, GSH), anions (SCN–, HPO42–, Cl–), and
oxidant (H2O2) were used to evaluate the selective
fluorescence response of HBTSeSe to H2S. As shown in Figure 2, the fluorescence
intensity almost remains same when 1000 times HPO42–, 1000 times Cl–, or 100 times H2O2 was added in the probe solution, respectively.
And a small increase fluorescence intensity is obtained when 1000
times Cys, 100 times GSH, or 100 times SCN– was
added in the probe solution, respectively. However, there is significant
fluorescence enhancement immediately after the probe reacted with
10 times H2S. Therefore, compared with H2S,
the coexisting substances had no significant effect on the fluorescence
response of HBTSeSe. It was demonstrated that HBTSeSe has high selectivity
to H2S. These results suggest that the design strategy
employing a double switch to improve the selectivity of HBTSeSe in
this study is feasible and effective.

10 μM HBTSeSe at 460
nm incubated by different species (100 mM Cys, 10 mM GSH, 10 mM KSCN,
100 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM H2O2, 100 μM Na2S) in aqueous (DMSO:PBS
= 1:1, v/v).

Kinetic Assay of Reaction
between HBTSeSe and H2S
Kinetic assays were carried
out to investigate the fluorescence
changes along with the reaction time. As shown in Figure 3, in the absence of H2S, the weak fluorescence of HBTSeSe remained stable under conditions
of light and air in a 30 min assay. After the addition of H2S, the fluorescence intensity increased consistently with increasing
concentration of H2S. Moreover, there is a sharp enhancement
in the fluorescence immediately after the addition of H2S into the probe solution. It can be speculated that HBTSeSe has
a fast-speed response to H2S during the initial time. Overall,
an ESIPT fluorescence probe with selectivity and rapid response to
H2S has been successfully achieved.

Detection of Exogenous
H2S Using HBTSeSe
HBTSeSe probe was successfully
applied to the detection of exogenous
H2S in living cells. As shown in Figure 4, RAW264.7 macrophage cells incubated with
HBTSeSe presented minimal fluorescence signal compared with those
incubated with HBTSeSe and different concentrations of exogenous H2S. It has been reported that H2S can move freely
across lipid membranes, as its solubility is five times more in lipophilic
solvents than that in water.24 Therefore,
a bright cyan fluorescence signal was observed when the cells were
treated with different concentrations of Na2S in the culture
media. The above observations are in accordance with the results obtained
in the solution. These results demonstrated that the HBTSeSe probe
is cell permeable and suitable for H2S detection in living
cells.

(a1, a2) Cells were induced by HBTSeSe (10 μM) for 20 min and
subsequently 30 min without Na2S. (b1, b2) Cells were induced

HBTSeSe (10 μM) for 20 min and subsequently induced by Na2S (100 μM) for 30 min (λex = 405 nm,
scale bar = 5 μM). All images were collected at the same microscopy
settings.

Detection
of Endogenous H2S Using HBTSeSe in the
Immune Response of RAW264.7 Cells
Phagocytes can produce
reactive oxygen species (ROS) via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate oxidase for killing pathogens. In vitro, the process producing
ROS can be induced by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Therefore,
the PMA stimulation has been employed as an effective means for decreasing
H2S concentrations in cells.25 However, it was reported that H2S played important roles
in immune response of cells.26 For understanding
the regulation mechanism of H2S in the immune response
process, we monitored the intracellular level of H2S in
RAW264.7 macrophages that were stimulated using different concentrations
of PMA. The fluorescence intensity analysis is shown in Figure 5. It was shown that the endogenous
H2S concentration gradually increased when the PMA concentration
was varied from 0 to 0.1 μg/mL. However, there is a decrease
in the endogenous H2S concentration as the PMA concentration
further increased. The confocal fluorescence images are shown in Figure S9.

cell incubated by 0.0, 0.05,

Subcellular Location of HBTSeSe
To illustrate the intracellular
distribution of HBTSeSe, the cells RAW264.7 were counter-stained with
HBTSeSe and commercial nuclear dyes STYO-59. The confocal microscopy
images reveal the cyan fluorescence signals from HBTSeSe and the red
fluorescence signals from STYO-59 (Figure 6). Moreover, the cytoplasm was dyed by HBTSeSe;
concomitantly, the nucleus was dyed by STYO-59. The result demonstrates
that the cell is alive when it was stained by HBTSeSe. Therefore,
the probe has low cytocoxicity and can be used in living cells.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel fluorescence probe
HBTSeSe was designed and
synthesized. The design strategy was based on nucleophilic attack
of H2S on the Se–Se bond, followed by thiolysis
of ether to release the HBT fluorophore. The HBT has the ESIPT property,
and a large Stokes shift is achieved. HBTSeSe has the advantage of
rapid response and high selectivity to H2S detection with
a 47-fold fluorescence enhancement based on the double-switch recognition
mechanism and ESIPT property. It also can be known that the low PMA
concentration (<0.8 μg/mL) could promote the H2S production in RAW264.7. In addition, the application of the HBTSeSe
probe for imaging intracellular H2S has been well demonstrated,
which shows its potential applications in biological system.

DICP research facilities center.

Synthetic Route
The synthetic route of the probe is
shown in Scheme S1 and detailed description
is as follows. All synthesis reactions are carried out in round-bottom
flasks with magnetic stirring.

Synthesis of 2-Aminobenzoic Acid (Compound 1)

(30.11 g, 0.20 mol) was added. The temperature was maintained at 41
°C. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography until
an equilibrium was achieved. Then, the solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in 30.0 mL ether and extracted
by 50.0 mL water three times. The water phase was mixed. The pH of
the water phase was adjusted by 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) to pH

was acquired through filtration and dried.

Synthesis of 2-Carboxybenzenediazonium
(Compound 2)
One hundred milliliters of H2O was poured into
a round-bottom flask with three necks. Next, 36% (w/w) hydrochloric
acid (38.0 mL) was slowly added. Then, anthranilic acid (18.0 g, 0.13
mol) was added, and the temperature was maintained at 5 °C. Thirty
milliliters of aqueous water containing sodium nitrite (8.99 g, 0.13
mol) was distributed in the flask. Compound 2 was obtained.
The product was used next without further purification.

Synthesis
of 2,2′-Diselanediyldibenzoic Acid (Compound 3)
H2O (35.0 mL) and Se powder (5.10 g,
0.065 mol) were added in a round-bottom flask with three necks under
nitrogen atmosphere. Aqueous waters containing sodium borohydride
(4.45 g, 0.13 mol) was distributed in the flask. Then, another part
of Se powder (5.10 g, 0.065 mol) was added. To make the mixture alkaline,
sodium hydroxide aqueous (25.0 mL) with the concentration of 10 M
was added.34 The temperature of the mixture
was kept under 5 °C. Compound 2 was slowly distributed
in the vessel with temperature under 10 °C. Then, the mixture
was heated at 60 °C for 3 h and then stirred at room temperature
for 3 h. The mixture was adjusted to pH = 3–4 by 1 M HCl. Compound 3 as obtained as a brown powder (9.86 g, 38%) after filtration
and washed with water to neutralize the mixture.

Synthesis
of HBTSeSe
This step has been reported by
Mlochowski et al.35 Compound 3 (2.50 g, 6.2 mmol) and benzene (33.0 mL) were added in a round-bottom
flask with three necks. Then, the mixture was heated to 85 °C,
and thionyl chloride (1.85 g, 15.7 mmol) was slowly distributed in
the flask. The solution was heated until the reaction reaches an equilibrium.
Without further purification, triethylamine (0.90 g, 9.0 mmol), dichloromethane
(17.0 mL), and 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole (HBT) (2.54 g, 11.2
mmol) were added in a round-bottom flask with three necks. The reaction
continued for 7 h under room temperature. HBTSeSe (1.57 g, 43%) was
obtained as a gray solid by flash chromatography column.

General
Details for UV–vis and Fluorescence Measurement
H2S and the probe HBTSeSe are hydrophilic and hydrophobic
compounds, respectively. It was reported that the probe could sufficiently
contact with H2S in the solution of DMSO:PBS = 1:1.36 In this study, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
PBS aqueous (pH 7.4, 100 mM) were pre-mixed in a 1 cm quartz cuvette
with the volume ratio of 1:1. Then 10 μM probe and 0, 0.5, 1,
2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 μM H2S were added with ratio of 0, 0.05, 0.1,
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. And another quartz cuvette
only contains 1:1 (v/v) of DMSO/water as the control.

To test
the selectivity of HBTSeSe, 20 μL DMSO with 100 μM HBTSeSe
was added in a 96-well ELISA plate. Then, 160 μL aqueous solution
of 1:1 (v/v) = of DMSO/PBS (pH 7.4, 100 mM) was added. Then, 20 μL
aqueous solution containing 100 mM cysteine (Cys), 10 mM glutathione
(GSH), 10 mM KSCN, 100 mM Na2HPO4, 100 mM KCl,
10 mM H2O2, and 100 μM Na2S
were added, respectively. Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash was used
to measure the fluorescence intensity at 460 nm with a 5 nm excite
slit and a 5 nm emission slit.

To test the kinetic of HBTSeSe
reaction with different ratios of
H2S, different concentrations of H2S (0, 0.5,
1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 μM H2S) were added in the 10
μM probe solution. Then, the fluorescence intensity at 460 nm
was measured by Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash with a 5 nm excite
slit and a 5 nm emission slit.

Cell Imaging Experiments
The rat macrophages, RAW264.7,
was cultured by biology group in Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics.
All the RAW264.7 cells were cultured according to the definition of
American Type Tissue Culture Collection (ATTC). The cells were cultured
in a MCO-15AC (Sanyo, Japan) incubator in the RPMI 1640 medium at
37 °C with the condition of CO2/air = 5:95. The normal
medium is acquired after 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), NaHCO3 (2 g/L), and 1% antibiotic (penicillin/streptomycin, 100
U/mL) were added in the RPMI 1640 medium. Na2S was as the
H2S donor to provide H2S. The working concentration
of the cell density was 106 cell/mL.

To image exogenous
H2S, RAW264.7 was cultured in the normal medium as the
control. Other cells were cultured in the media that have another
50 μM Na2S and 100 μM Na2S, respectively.
To image endogenous H2S, the cells were induced with different
concentrations of PMA (0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.0 μg/mL)
for 30 min. Then, the images were patterned onto the normal medium
containing 10 μM probe and cultured at 37 °C for 20 min.
After the end of culture, the culture medium was removed and washed
with PBS solution (pH 7.4, 100 mM) and characterized by an Olympus
Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscopy. Stock solutions
of the cell nucleus dye SYTO-59 (0.1 μM) were prepared in DMSO.
RAW264.7 was cultured for 20 min on a normal medium containing 10
μM probe and then stained for 20 min by STYO-59. In the process,
100 μM Na2S was added into the medium. The cell was
excited by mercury lamp 405 and 635 nm and then imaged by Olympus
Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscopy.
