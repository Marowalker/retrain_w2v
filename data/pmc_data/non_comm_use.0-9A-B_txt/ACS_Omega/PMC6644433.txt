A unique
three-dimensional (3D) structure consisting of a hierarchical
nickel–cobalt dichalcogenide spinel nanostructure is investigated
for its electrocatalytic properties at benign neutral and alkaline
pH and applied as an air cathode for practical zinc–air batteries.
The results show a high oxygen evolution reaction catalytic activity
of nickel–cobalt sulfide nanosheet arrays grown on carbon cloth
(NiCo2S4 NS/CC) over the commercial benchmarking
catalyst under both pH conditions. In particular, the NiCo2S4 NS/CC air cathode shows high discharge capacity, a
narrow potential gap between discharge and charge, and superior cycle
durability with reversibility, which exceeds that of commercial precious
metal-based electrodes. The excellent performance of NiCo2S4 NS/CC in water electrolyzers and zinc–air batteries
is mainly due to highly exposed electroactive sites with a rough surface,
morphology-based advantages of nanosheet arrays, good adhesion between
NiCo2S4 and the conducting carbon cloth, and
the active layer formed of nickel–cobalt (oxy)hydroxides during
water splitting. These results suggest that NiCo2S4 NS/CC could be a promising candidate as an efficient electrode
for high-performance water electrolyzers and rechargeable zinc–air
batteries.

Introduction
Splitting water into
pure hydrogen and oxygen to generate sustainable
green hydrogen energy has been intensively studied in recent years,
which can replace fossil fuel use.1,2 However, the
efficiency of water splitting has so far been limited by the lack
of sustainable catalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)
that can accelerate the kinetics.3−5 So far, IrOx and RuO2 are the best-known OER catalysts,
although their high cost and scarcity limit their widespread use.4 Meanwhile, some promising attempts have been
devoted to developing an efficient nonprecious metal OER catalyst
under alkaline conditions. However, an almost harsh alkaline medium
presents severe corrosion and related environmental issues.6,7 In this regard, someday, the splitting of water at neutral pH from
ocean or river would be the target goal to satisfy renewable future
hydrogen energy.4 It is thus highly required
to develop efficient OER electrocatalysts that can operate in both
alkaline and neutral media for overall water splitting even though
it is relatively tough searching for those catalysts.

Nowadays,
various nonprecious transition metal-based catalysts
are being explored, for example, transition metals,8 transition-metal oxides,9,10 chalcogenides,11−14 phosphides,15−17 hydroxides/oxyhydroxides,18,19 carbides,20 borides,21 and so on. Although lots of established catalysts have
been reported concerning their excellent OER activity under alkaline
conditions, only a few of them could still maintain their catalytic
activity in neutral media. Cai et al. reported that the amorphous
cobalt sulfide porous nanocubes showed a low OER onset potential of
1.5 V, comparable to that of RuO2 (1.49 V).22 However, a still substantial overpotential of
570 mV is needed to generate 4.59 mA cm–2 in phosphate-buffered
solutions (PBSs; pH 7.0), whereas it could generate 10 mA cm–2 current density at 290 mV in 1 M KOH (pH 14.0). Similarly, sulfur-incorporated
NiFe2O4 nanosheets (NSs) on nickel foam (S–NiFe2O4/NF) developed by Liu et al. exhibited a remarkably
enhanced water-splitting performance for both OER and hydrogen evolution
reaction (HER) as a bifunctional electrode under both alkaline and
neutral conditions.23 The S–NiFe2O4/NF still requires 1.921 V to deliver 10 mA cm–2 in 1 M PBS (pH 7.4) for overall water splitting in
three electrode systems, mostly occurring during OER with an overpotential
of 494 mV. As air cathode catalysts for Zn–air batteries, Prabu
et al., demonstrated a highly active one-dimensional structure of
a spinel NiCo2O4 catalyst in rechargeable Zn–air
batteries and Li–O2 batteries.24,100 Recently, Meng et al. constructed Co0.85Se nanocrystals
in situ coupled with N-doped carbon with a metal–nitrogen–carbon
(M–N–C) structure and short diffusion pathways for the
transport of electron/ion to improve the Zn–air battery performance.25,26 For instance, Wu et al. reported zinc cobalt sulfide, the nanoneedle
(NN) arrays grown on the carbon fiber paper electrode catalyst, which
enables the Zn–air battery operation with an overpotential
of 0.85 V and a long cycle life time of up to 200 cycles at 10 mA
cm–2 as well as comparable water-splitting performance.27 Wang et al. proposed Co3FeS1.5(OH)6 hydroxysulfides serving as a superb air electrode
catalyst with a low overpotential of 0.84 V and prolonged cyclability
over 36 h test for 108 cycles at 2 mA cm–2.28

In pursuit of high electrochemical performance
in water electrolyzers
and for a Zn–air battery application, the spinel bimetallic
sulfide NiCo2S4 with abundant redox chemistry
has been considered to be the most promising electrochemically active
material, which exhibits 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of
NiCo2O4 and ∼104 times better
electric conductivity than conventional single-metal compounds.12,29 Moreover, the stable spinel structures of bimetallic sulfide with
a formula of AB2S4 possess plentiful exposed
edge sites, leading to a higher electrochemical activity. Therefore,
it has been widely applied for supercapacitors, Li-ion batteries,
and a counter electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells as well as
in water electrolyzers.30 For example,
in our group, NiCo2S4 nanowire arrays were directly
grown on 3D Ni foam (NiCo2S4 NW/NF) as a water-splitting
catalyst and applied in an alkaline water electrolyzer. Because of
its intrinsic properties, large surface area, and well-separated NW
structures, NiCo2S4 NW/NF afforded continuous
water-splitting reaction of generating hydrogen and oxygen gas at
a cell voltage of only 1.63 V to generate 10 mA cm–2 current density.31 Ma et al. developed
3D networked porous NiCo2S4 nanoflakes on NF,
which can offer more exposed active sites and easy transport of electrons
and ions, thereby leading to significantly improved HER activity and
stability.32 The outstanding OER performance
of the spinel bimetallic sulfide NiCo2S4 has
also become a promising application for rechargeable Zn–air
batteries involving reversible OER and ORR.

Also, hybridizing
NiCo2S4 with the 3D structure
of NS or NN with a carbon cloth (CC) (NiCo2S4 NS/CC or NN/CC) substrate by an in situ growth hydrothermal approach
can be an efficient way to enhance the robustness of the electrode.
It could also help to minimize the agglomeration of NiCo2S4 nanostructures and the detachment during long-term
operation, and make faster ion/electron kinetics. Also, the advantages
of CC, such as flexibility, high conductivity, and corrosion/dissolution
resistivity might lead to enhanced catalytic activity and stability
in a wide pH range.33 Meanwhile, tuning
the nanostructure and the morphology, as well as porosity, can be
another promising strategy to produce numerous exposed catalytic active
sites on the catalyst surface.17

On the basis of our knowledge, we describe the physical and electrochemical
properties of NiCo2S4 NS/CC as a highly active
OER catalyst in both neutral and alkaline media, which have not been
thoroughly investigated so far. Mainly, this is the first time a bimetallic
sulfide, the NiCo2S4-based material, is reported
to catalyze OER under a neutral condition. The catalytic performance
of NiCo2S4 NS/CC is remarkably enhanced compared
to the recent reports, particularly under a neutral condition. The
NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrocatalyst exhibits the lowest
OER overpotentials of 260 and 402 mV to generate 10 mA cm–2 in alkaline and neutral media, respectively. Specifically, it exhibits
a low Tafel slope of 123 mV dec–1 and a high turnover
frequency (TOF) of 8.17 × 10–3 s–1 at 1.63 V applied potential to drive 10 mA cm–2 current density under neutral conditions, confirming superior intrinsic
activity with a substantial electrochemical active surface area (ECSA)
of NiCo2S4 NS/CC compared with commercial RuO2/CC and other previously reported OER electrocatalysts. In
addition, the constructed NiCo2S4 NS/CC air
cathode for primary and rechargeable Zn–air batteries exhibits
high discharge capacity, a narrow overall overpotential, and a long
cycling life time exceeding the benchmark for precious metal-based
electrodes.

Experimental Methods
Material Synthesis
Cobalt nitrate
hexahydrate [Alfa
Aesar, Co(NO3)2·6H2O], nickel
nitrate hexahydrate [Sigma-Aldrich, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O], urea (Sigma-Aldrich, CH4N2O), and sodium sulfide hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich, Na2S·xH2O) were used to synthesize
the electrodes. A piece of CC (NARA CELL-TECH, 0.7 cm × 0.7 cm)
was utilized with further treatment with ethanol. The NiCo2S4 NSs grown on CC (NiCo2S4 NS/CC)
were prepared through a two-step hydrothermal process. A nickel nitrate
of 0.004 M and cobalt nitrate of 0.008 M was dissolved in 120 mL of
deionized water; further, 0.012 M urea was added. The obtained solution
was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave of 200
mL capacity, and a piece of CC was immersed in the solution. The autoclave
was heated at 120 °C for 8 h in an electric oven. After the first
step, the electrode was washed with deionized water several times
to eliminate unreacted residues. Consequently, sodium sulfide flakes
were dissolved in deionized water to prepare a 0.2 M sulfide solution
for a sulfurization process. This sulfur-containing solution was again
transferred to the autoclave and heated at 160 °C for 8 h in
an electric oven. After cooling down to room temperature naturally,
we washed the synthesized electrode several times with ethanol and
deionized water, followed by the drying step in the vacuum oven at
60 °C overnight. For comparison, NiCo2S4 NN arrays on CC (NiCo2S4 NN/CC) were prepared
by changing the temperature of the first hydrothermal step from 120
to 130 °C and maintaining the heating time of 8 h. To synthesize
NiCo2O4 with NSs morphology, which is grown
on CC (NiCo2O4 NS/CC), the electrode after the
first step of the hydrothermal growth process was annealed at 450
°C for 2 h in an air atmosphere.

Microstructural Characterizations
The morphology and
element compositions were studied on a field-emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi-S4800, 3 kV) system equipped with a Horiba
Scientific energy dispersive spectrometer and using transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HF-3300, 300 kV). The crystal structures
of all catalysts were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku
MiniFlex600). The composition of the catalyst was studied using X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo-Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi).

Electrochemical Measurements
For electrochemical measurements,
the OER catalytic performance was evaluated by linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) with a low scan rate of 1 mV s–1 in an electrolyte
of 1 M KOH and a PBS without purging oxygen. The OER performance was
evaluated in a three-electrode configuration directly using synthesized
electrodes such as NiCo2S4 NS/CC, NiCo2S4 NN/CC, and NiCo2O4 NS/CC as a
working electrode (1.0 mg cm–2), a saturated calomel
electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter
electrode. Similarly, commercial RuO2 cast onto CC was
used as a working electrode (1.4 mg cm–2), Pt wire
as a counter electrode, and SCE as a reference electrode. The potentials
reported were converted to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE).
All electrochemical results were iR-corrected, considering
the ohmic resistance from the electrolyte. The current densities presented
in this paper are normalized concerning the geometric surface area
of the electrode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in N2-saturated 1 M KOH at room temperature with a scan rate of
10 mV s–2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) was performed within a frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz.

The ECSA is calculated by following an established methodology
reported in the literature.31 In detail,
through the cyclic voltammogram obtained in a non-faradaic region
at various scan rates (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV s–1), double-layer capacitance (Cdl) can
be estimated. By plotting the anodic and cathodic current densities
against the scan rate, the obtained linear slope value is Cdl. Finally, the ECSA can be obtained from the
following equation:  

Cs denotes the specific capacitance
of a flat, smooth surface of the electrode material, which is assumed
to be 26 μF cm–2 for Ni- and Co-containing
materials.

Zinc–Air Battery Fabrication and Testing
For
full-cell zinc–air battery evaluation, the as-synthesized NiCo2S4 NS/CC or commercial catalyst of RuO2 + Pt/C/CC was used as an air-breathing cathode (1.54 cm2). Typically, the NiCo2S4 NS/CC air cathode
was prepared with a loading amount of 1.0 mg cm–2. The commercial catalyst-based cathode was fabricated by coating
with 2 mg of RuO2 and 40 wt % Pt/C on CC to achieve a loading
of 1.30 mg cm–2. A polished zinc plate with a thickness
of 0.1 mm, 6 M KOH solution with 0.2 M zinc acetate, and a Whatman
glass microfiber filter membrane were prepared as an anode, an electrolyte,
and a separator, respectively, to assemble the zinc–air battery
with a coin cell (MTI Korea) configuration. The specific capacity
and the charge–discharge curves were reported with a battery
analyzer (BST8-3), which consumed ambient air. The discharge capacity
of the primary zinc–air cell was normalized to the consumed
mass of Zn metal, whereas the current density was normalized to the
area of the electrode.

Results and Discussion
The hierarchical
bimetallic sulfide NS arrays/CC hybrids were developed
using an in situ two-step hydrothermal method, as graphically represented
in Scheme 1. In the
first step of the hydrothermal process, nickel nitrate hexahydrate
and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate in a stoichiometric ratio were dissolved
in deionized water and then urea was added. The solution was transferred
into an autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 8 h, forming cobalt–nickel
carbonate hydroxide hydrate NS arrays on a CC substrate. Subsequently,
after oxidation reaction, a solution of sodium sulfide flakes dissolved
in deionized water was prepared for the next sulfurization process.
The anion exchange reaction from Co32–/OH– anions to S2– anions occurred
at 160 °C for 6 h, thereby leading the complete phase transformation
from cobalt–nickel carbonate hydroxide hydrate to nickel–cobalt
sulfide on the CC. The morphology and composition of NiCo2S4 NS/CC were studied by FE-SEM and TEM. The bare CC consists
of interconnected fibers with a smooth surface, as shown in Figure 1a. After the first
hydrothermal reaction, numerous NS arrays are stacked onto the surface
of CC with a rough surface shown in Figures 1b and S1. Consequently,
the second hydrothermal process for sulfurization treatment is conducted,
and its NS-like morphology perpendicular to a substrate with a rough
surface still preserves its architecture (Figure 1e). From the top view of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, as shown in Figure 1c,d, the NiCo2S4 NSs
that are interconnected with each other and form a porous architecture
with submicron-size pores, providing ample space for the fast diffusion
of redox ions during the reaction, uniformly cover the surface of
CC. For comparison, the needle-like shape of NiCo2S4 vertically grown on the surface of CC with the average length
of 3 μm is also synthesized to understand the effect of morphology
on catalytic activities in both alkaline and neutral medium (Figure S2a–c). Also, the NiCo2O4 NS/CC was fabricated to have the same morphological
characteristics as NiCo2S4 NS/CC (Figure S2d–f).

Scheme 1 Schematic Preparation Process of Self-Supported
NiCo2S4 NS/CC Nanostructures
The XRD patterns of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, NiCo2S4 NN/CC, and NiCo2O4 NS/CC
are presented in Figure 2a. After oxidation reaction in the first step of the hydrothermal
process, nickel–cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate NS arrays
are uniformly formed on the CC, as shown in Figure S1 (ICDD 00-040-0216). During the sulfurization in the second
hydrothermal step, the nickel–cobalt carbonate hydroxide hydrate
phase is completely transformed into spinel nickel–cobalt sulfide
without destroying the original nanostructures. The diffraction peaks
of NiCo2S4 NS/CC and NiCo2S4 NN/CC at 16.2°, 26.7°, 31.4°, 38.1°, 50.3°,
and 55.1° are assigned to the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511),
and (440) planes of cubic-phase NiCo2S4, respectively
(ICDD 00-043-1477). The high-resolution TEM image in Figure 2b reveals the interplanar distance
of 0.28, 0.23, 0.16, 0.33, and 0.18 nm, corresponding to the (311),
(400), (440), (220), and (511) planes of NiCo2S4, respectively, confirming the successful formation of NiCo2S4. The formation of NiCo2S4 NS/CC
is confirmed based on the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) using TEM,
which shows that the atomic percentages of nickel, cobalt, and sulfur
are 15.2, 30.7, and 54.1 at. %, respectively, as shown in Figure S3. Note that the two characteristic peaks
at 26° and 43° for all prepared electrodes are attributed
to the CC (ICDD 01-074-2329). The diffraction peaks of the NiCo2O4 NS/CC catalyst obtained after the first step
in the hydrothermal process and heat treatment are consistent with
the standard pattern of NiCo2O4 (ICDD 01-073-1702).
Meanwhile, the NN-like morphology of NiCo2S4 NN/CC can be confirmed from the TEM elemental mapping images shown
in Figure S4.

S 2p, and (f) C 1s.

To further characterize
the chemical composition of electrodes,
the XPS analysis is carried out, and results are given in Figure 2c–f. As shown
in Figure 2c, the Ni
2p spectrum consists of two spin–orbit doublets of Ni2+ and Ni3+, including Ni2+ at 853.8 eV for Ni
2p3/2 and 873.8 eV for Ni 2p1/2, and Ni3+ at 857.7 eV for Ni 2p3/2 and 875.6 eV for Ni
2p1/2.24,30,34,35 The XPS spectrum of Co 2p (Figure 2d) contains well-resolved peaks
of Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p1/2, and Co3+ 2p1/2 at 798.8, 793.9, 783.0, and 778.9 eV, respectively, implying the
co-presence of Co2+ and Co3+ species in NiCo2S4 NS/CC.23,34 The S 2p XPS spectrum
(Figure 2e) shows two
peaks at 163.0 and 161.8 eV, which are assigned to metal–sulfur
bonds and the low coordination state sulfur ion that exists at the
surface of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, respectively, with
the satellite peak appearing at 170.1 eV in Figure 2e.34,35 The C 1s spectrum of
NiCo2S4 NS/CC is deconvoluted into four peaks
located at 284.8, 285.5, 287.0, and 291.3 eV, which correspond to
the C 1s orbital of C–C (sp2), C–C (sp),
C–O, and π–π interactions, respectively
(Figure 2f). The additional
π–π interaction indicates the strong interactions
between NiCo2S4 NSs arrays and the CC, which
can minimize contact resistance to generate a direct electron pathway.29 The binding energy values of Ni 2p, Co 2p, and
S 2p are matched well with the previous reports on NiCo2S4-based materials.

The OER catalytic activity of
NiCo2S4 NS/CC
was first evaluated with a three-electrode setup using a low scan
rate of 1 mV s–1 to eliminate the capacitive current
effects in alkaline solution (1 M KOH, pH = 14). For comparison, NiCo2S4 NN/CC, NiCo2O4 NS/CC,
bare CC, and RuO2/CC benchmarking OER catalysts were also
tested under the same condition. All the synthesized electrodes in
this work are directly used as free-standing oxygen-evolving electrodes,
including conventional RuO2/CC, to avoid possible influencing
factors. The LSV polarization curves and Tafel plots for all samples
are revealed, as shown in Figure 3a,b. The NiCo2S4 NS/CC exhibits
a superior catalytic activity toward OER with a low onset potential
of only 180 mV. Moreover, the overpotential of 260 mV is required
to generate 10 mA cm–2, which is smaller than that
of NiCo2S4 NN/CC (316 mV), NiCo2O4 NS/CC (368 mV), RuO2/CC (322 mV), and bare CC
(484 mV). Also, it requires only a 280 mV overpotential to afford
10 mA cm–2 when the scan rate is 5 mV s–1 (Figure S5). It is lower than those of
many other reported nonprecious metal-based OER electrocatalysts tested
under 1 M KOH conditions, such as NiCo2S4 NWs/graphdiyne
foam (300 mV), NiCo2S4/NF (306 mV)—, NiCo2S4 NAs/CC (310 mV), and so on.22−24,29,31,36−39 A detailed comparison is further
summarized in Table S1. The cyclic voltammograms
for NiCo2S4 NS/CC and NiCo2O4 NS/CC in the potential region from 1.0 to 1.8 V show a broad
peak at 1.36 and 1.22 V, indicating the redox behavior of Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively (Figure S7). The catalytic kinetics of OER is evaluated by Tafel plots in alkaline
medium. The Tafel slope of NiCo2S4 NS/CC is
72 mV dec–1, which is lower than that of all other
electrodes, such as RuO2/CC (87 mV dec–1), NiCo2S4 NN/CC (84 mV dec–1), NiCo2O4 NS/CC (114 mV dec–1), and bare CC (178 mV dec–1), indicating a more
favorable rate of OER at the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode.
The favorable kinetics of OER on NiCo2S4 NS/CC
is also supported by EIS analysis to measure the charge transfer resistance
during OER (Figure S6). The charge transfer
resistance of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, which forms NSs
morphology is 8.94 Ω at 1.5 V versus RHE, smaller than that
of NiCo2S4 NN/CC with NN-like architectures
(16.3 Ω). In contrast, NiCo2O4 NS/CC shows
at least five times higher charge transfer resistance than that of
NiCo2S4 NS/CC and NiCo2S4 NN/CC under the same applied potential because of the lower electrical
conductivity of NiCo2O4 NS/CC.

a fixed potential of 1.55 V for 162 h.

To better understand the different OER catalytic activities
of
NiCo2S4 NS/CC, including NiCo2S4 NN/CC and NiCo2O4 NS/CC catalysts,
the ECSA and roughness factor (RF) of all electrodes are determined
to estimate the real catalytic activities in the same pH condition.
It can be easily calculated based on the double-layer capacitance
(Cdl) through CV in a non-faradaic region
at different scan rates of 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 50 mV s–1 (Figure 3c). The
NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode shows over twofold higher
ECSA value of 5.5 mF cm–2 than that of NiCo2S4 NN/CC (2.0 mF cm–2) and NiCo2O4 NS/CC (2.3 mF cm–2), respectively
(Figure S8). This indicates that plenty
of catalytically active sites for OER might form on NiCo2S4 NS/CC.

The surface roughness for all electrodes
was also calculated by
dividing the estimated ECSA to the geometric area of the electrode,
and the values of 27.5, 10, and 11.5 were achieved for each electrode,
NiCo2S4 NS/CC, NiCo2S4 NN/CC, and NiCo2O4 NS/CC, respectively. On
the basis of these results, 2D NS architecture arrays can offer larger
space and have a rougher surface; hence, they lead to more electrochemical
active sites on the catalyst surface. As a result, the excellent electrocatalytic
performances of the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode
can be partially ascribed to the high ECSA and consequently highly
exposed active sites.

We further calculate the TOF, which could
provide the intrinsic
OER catalytic activities of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, NiCo2S4 NN/CC, and NiCo2O4 NS/CC
electrodes. The TOF of various electrocatalysts was derived using
the following equation:  J is the geometric current
density at a specific overpotential. A denotes the
geometric area of the electrode. The number of electrons consumed
for generating 1 mol of O2 from water is 4. F is the Faraday constant value of 96 485 C mol–1. m denotes the mole numbers of active materials.40 On the basis of this calculation, at an overpotential
of 350 mV, the TOF of NiCo2S4 NS/CC and NiCo2S4 NN/CC is calculated as 7.46 × 10–2 and 4.12 × 10–2 mol O2 s–1, respectively (Figure 3e). In sharp contrast, NiCo2O4 NS/CC has the
lowest TOF value of 1.19 × 10–2 s–1. Moreover, it is almost fourfold higher than that of the IrOx catalyst (0.89 × 10–2 s–1), indicating that the NiCo2S4 NS/CC is highly efficient toward OER.41

The specific activity of catalysts with different
surface areas
or loading is calculated with current normalization by the catalyst
RF. NiCo2S4 NS/CC can deliver a high specific
current density of 2.67 mA cm–2, whereas NiCo2O4 NS/CC can produce only 0.96 mA cm–2 at the same overpotential of 350 mV. Even though their morphology
appears to be similar, that is, the density and the distribution of
NiCo2S4 NSs on the CC are virtually the same
as those of NiCo2O4 NSs on CC, NiCo2S4 NS/CC outperforms NiCo2O4 NS/CC.
This result shows that NiCo2S4 NS arrays on
CC have a higher intrinsic OER catalytic activity than that of NiCo2O4 NS arrays on CC (Figure 3d), which can be explained by the difference
in the crystal structure of NiCo2S4 and NiCo2O4. NiCo2S4 that formed closely
packed arrays of large S2– anions with nickel and
cobalt metal cations in different oxidation states occupying the tetrahedral
and octahedral sites, respectively, possesses more octahedral active
sites of Co(III) concerning NiCo2O4, which has
smaller anions of O2– in the spinel structure.31,42 On the basis of the previous literature, σ* orbital (eg) occupation–related metal cations at octahedral sites
are mostly coordinated with electrocatalytic activities.43 In view of this point, NiCo2S4 NS/CC might afford better OER intrinsic activity compared
to NiCo2O4 NS/CC.

The electrocatalytic
activity toward the OER of NiCo2S4 NS/CC is
also evaluated in PBS (pH = 7) as well as
control samples as shown in Figure 4a. Similar to the OER activity trend in alkaline media,
the NiCo2S4 NS/CC catalyst exhibits the highest
OER performance compared with other electrodes. Surprisingly, NiCo2S4 NS/CC requires only 321 and 402 mV to afford
5 and 10 mA cm2, respectively. However, RuO2/CC as a state-of-the-art OER catalyst needs an extremely large overpotential
of 700 mV to deliver 5 mA cm–2 current density.
At the same time, NiCo2S4 NN/CC and NiCo2O4 NS/CC require at least 368 and 460 mV to produce
5 mA cm–2, respectively. Bare CC shows negligible
OER performance. The catalytic activity of NiCo2S4 NS/CC for OER in neutral media is exceptional compared to that of
many electrodes reported recently, such as CoS4.6O0.6 (η = 570 mV for 5 mA cm–2),19 ultrathin Co3S4 NS (η
= 650 mV for 3.27 mA cm–2),40 Co3O4 nanorod (η = 385 mV for 1 mA cm–2),44 Co-Pi NA/Ti foam (η
= 450 mV for 10 mA cm–2),15 Co–Bi NSs/graphene (η = 570 mV for 14.4 mA cm–2),18 and Fe–Ni–P (η
= 429 mV for 10 mA cm–2).14 The detailed comparison is summarized in Table S2. Figure 4b shows the Tafel plots of all electrodes for a better understanding
of the obtained catalytic behavior. The Tafel slope of 123 mV dec–1 in a neutral electrolyte for NiCo2S4 NS/CC is achieved. It is the smallest value among NiCo2S4 NN/CC (125 mV dec–1) and NiCo2O4 NS/CC (203 mV dec–1) and comparable
to that of RuO2/CC (115 mV dec–1), which
in turn favors the kinetics of OER. Notably, in comparison with NiCo2O4 NS/CC, the NiCo2S4 NS/CC
catalyst presents a lower Tafel slope value, originating from the
increase in electrical conductivity as well as more plentiful electrocatalytic
active sites correlated with its intrinsic activities.

curves for OER. (b) Corresponding Tafel plots of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, along with NiCo2S4 NN/CC, NiCo2O4 NS/CC, RuO2/CC, and CC electrodes
for comparison. (c) Cyclic voltammogram measured in a non-faradaic
region at various scan rates for the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode. (d) Anodic and cathodic current density vs scan

and TOF of NiCo2S4 NS/CC, NiCo2S4 NN/CC, and NiCo2O4 NS/CC electrodes
in PBS. (f) Time dependence of the current density for NiCo2S4 NS/CC at a fixed potential of 1.6 V for 11 h.

We further measure the double-layer
charging of electrodes via
scan-rate-dependent CVs to estimate the effective surface areas for
catalytic activity. The potential range in which the non-faradaic
region was chosen with the potential window of 0.04 V centered at
an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of each system.34 The electrochemical double-layer capacitance for NiCo2S4 NS/CC is 0.044 mF cm–2, whereas those
for NiCo2S4 NN/CC and NiCo2O4 NS/CC are 0.025 and 0.023 mF cm–2, respectively,
indicating the rougher surface of the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode. It is noticeable that NiCo2S4 NS/CC still possesses almost twofold higher electrochemical double-layer
capacitance than NiCo2O4 NS/CC in neutral media,
which is probably because of the well-aligned hierarchical NSs architecture
and the formation of numerous electrochemically active sites. The
TOF at the overpotential of 400 mV in neutral media is evaluated to
compare the intrinsic activities of NiCo2S4 NS/CC
with those of other comparison electrodes. The calculated TOF for
NiCo2S4 NS/CC is 9.89 × 10–3 s–1, which is much larger than those for previously
reported cobalt-based catalysts, including Co3S4 (1.32 × 10–3 s–1 at η
= 500 mV),40 Co–Pi (∼2 ×
10–3 s–1 at η = 410 mV),45 Co–Bi (1.5 × 10–3 s–1 at η = 400 mV),46 and Co3O4 (≥0.8 × 10–3 s–1 at η = 414 mV),40 further suggesting the remarkable OER catalytic activity of NiCo2S4 NS/CC under neutral conditions. The NiCo2S4 NN/CC for which NiCo2S4 NN arrays are grown on CC indicates a TOF of 4.83 × 10–3 s–1, implying its lower intrinsic
activities compared with that of the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode, whereas the TOF of NiCo2O4 NN/CC is calculated as 2.47 × 10–3 s–1, which shows the lowest value among the three electrodes.
Therefore, the remarkable electrocatalytic activity of NiCo2S4 NS/CC can partially originate from the higher electrochemical
surface area and the direct contact between NiCo2S4 NS arrays and the CC, which facilitate fast electron transfer
as well as enhanced mass transportation. In addition, (i) the intrinsic
electrocatalytic activity of the NiCo2S4 with
larger anions compared with NiCo2O4 so as to
expose more cation active sites; (ii) the enough void space among
interconnected NiCo2S4 NSs, which allows facile
redox ion diffusion; (iii) the 2D morphology of NiCo2S4 NSs that yields a large contact area between the catalyst
and the electrolyte; and (iv) the formation of the nickel–cobalt
(oxy)hydroxide active layer on its surface, which will be discussed
later, all contributed to the superb performance of NiCo2S4 NS/CC in the OER.

The long-term operation of
the OER catalyst is a critical issue
for practical application. Figure 3f exhibits the chronoamperometric (CA) curve of the
NiCo2S4 NS/CC measured at 1.55 V potential in
alkaline media (1 M KOH). After the 29 h CA test, the electrode entirely
stabilizes and retains a current density of 10 mA cm–2 (without iR corrected) and then is reduced to 85%
of its original activity over 160 h long-term operation. The inset
of Figure 3f shows
the linear polarization curves of NiCo2S4 NS/CC
before and after 1000 CV cycles with 50 mV s–1 scan
rate and a potential range from 1.2 to 1.7 V. Accordingly, there is
no difference in the LSV curve recorded after 1000 CV cycles, indicating
its high stability. Meanwhile, we detected losses of larger than 24,
29, and 47% in their current densities within 50 h for NiCo2S4 NN/CC, NiCo2O4 NS/CC, and RuO2/CC, respectively, at the same potential of 1.55 V in 1 M
KOH solution. We also performed the durability test for same electrodes
under the neutral condition. NiCo2S4 NS/CC presents
excellent durability for 11 h, achieving 6 mA cm–2 at 1.6 V versus RHE with only 10% loss. During CA, O2 gas bubbles were visibly observed from the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode and dissipated quickly into the electrolyte.
The NiCo2S4 NN/CC and NiCo2O4 NS/CC electrodes show a dramatic catalytic activity loss
of 45 and 54%, respectively. Moreover, RuO2/CC almost lost
its catalytic activity after 4 h durability test. The morphological
robustness of NiCo2S4 NS/CC was examined by
post-OER FE-SEM analysis under alkaline and neutral conditions (Figure S12). Maintaining morphology with negligible
damage is another convincing evidence of the structural robustness
of NiCo2S4 NS/CC observed in the FE-SEM micrographs.

Recently, Li et al.46 reported that
the nonoxide transition metal-based chalcogenides, especially cobalt
selenide catalysts, usually oxidize during the OER under the basic
condition and progressively transform to the corresponding TM (oxy)hydroxides,
which is proposed to be the true active species to catalyze the OER.47 In the case of the Co3Se4/CF electrode, the XPS peak intensity of Se virtually disappears
after a 3 h chronopotentiometric electrolysis duration, and after
12 h, Co3Se4 is converted to CoOOH. Similarly,
in our study, we investigated the composition of the electrode after
160 h CA operation by XPS (Figure S11)
to confirm the real surface species of NiCo2S4 NS/CC. The XPS Ni 2p shows that Ni2+ at 853.8 eV for
Ni 2p3/2 and 873.8 eV for Ni 2p1/2 visibly disappears
and the peaks located at 855.7 and 873.2 eV are assigned to Ni3+ species of the nickel (oxy)hydroxide.31,48 Moreover, the binding energy shift of Ni 2p for 1.4 eV reveals the
occurrence of electron transfer during extended CA electrolysis. Similarly,
the XPS Co 2p3/2 peak is deconvoluted into two peaks of
780.7 and 782.3 eV, which represent the formation of Co(OH)2 and CoOOH, implying the formation of a higher valence state of cobalt
(Co3+).49,50 Meanwhile, the peak intensity
of S 2p was weakened, whereas the two strong peaks of O 1s spectra
were observed at 531.3 and 532.7 eV, indicating the O–H bond
in NiCoOOH and the adsorption of H2O on the surface of
NiCo2S4 NS/CC, respectively.48−50 The XPS results
demonstrate that in situ electrochemical tuning of nickel–cobalt
sulfide to nickel–cobalt mixed (oxy)hydroxide phase occurred,
which is highly active for the OER catalytic activity attributed to
the enhanced surface area and electrochemically active sites. This
transformation might change the electronic states and the interactions
with intermediate products during OER. Hence, it leads to the catalyst
becoming more catalytic active for OER, which is also shown in other
chalcogenide materials.46,50

The post-OER
durability measurement for over 11 h in the neutral
medium was also carried out using XPS analysis to confirm the chemical
composition (Figure S12). Similarly, in
an alkaline environment, the Ni2+ peak disappeared from
the surface of catalyzed NiCo2S4 NS/CC and transformed
to Ni3+ of TM (oxy)hydroxides with binding energy values
at 855.7 and 873.2 eV as well as satellite peaks at 865.1 and 879.9
eV. Also, the new peaks formed at 779.9 and 781.1 eV are also assigned
to the (oxy)hydroxides phase.47−50 It is noticeable that similar phenomena of in situ
electrochemical tuning for NiCo2S4 NS/CC have
occurred under a neutral condition, achieving an increase in the surface
area as well as electrochemically active sites for primarily improved
catalytic activity for OER.

To validate the practical application
of the NiCo2S4 NS/CC catalyst, a primary zinc–air
battery was demonstrated
and fully discharged to 0.6 V at a current density of 5 mA cm–2 (Figure 5a). The NiCo2S4 NS/CC cathode shows
an OCV of 1.18 V with a specific capacity of 722 mA h g–1, which is almost 88.1% utilization of theoretical capacity (∼820
mA h g–1), whereas the commercial catalyst-based
cathode shows an OCV of 1.31 V with a discharge capacity of 590 mA
h g–1. Moreover, the galvanostatic discharge–charge
cycling performance was evaluated at a current density of 5 mA cm–2 with a 5 min discharge followed by 5 min charge for
each cycle (Figure 5b). For the initial cycle of NiCo2S4 NS/CC,
the rechargeable battery discharged at 1.11 V versus Zn, with the
corresponding charging potential of 1.90 V giving an overall overpotential
of 0.79 V, which increased only 0.04 V (1.95 V for charge and 1.12
V for discharge potential) after 30 h battery operation (173 cycles).
However, in the case of RuO2 + Pt/C/CC, the potential gap
between charge and discharge increased continuously from 0.61 to 1.00
V even after 1350 min (135 cycles) cycling. The superior cycling durability
over 173 cycles with a high discharge capacity of 722 mA h g–1 indicates the excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability
of NiCo2S4 NS/CC for zinc–air batteries.

and RuO2 + Pt/C/CC air cathodes at 5 mA cm–2 in 10 min interval cycles.

A two-electrode alkaline water electrolyzer was developed
for full
water splitting with NiCo2S4 NS/CC and Pt/C/CC
as the anode and cathode, respectively, in 1 M KOH solution (Figure 6). To achieve a current
density of 10 mA cm–2, a voltage of 1.53 V was needed
for water splitting with gas evolution on both electrode surfaces,
showing more advantages to split water than precious metal-based electrodes,
which requires higher cell voltages of 1.64 V.

Conclusions
In summary, the hierarchical
spinel bimetallic sulfide nanostructures
in situ grown on the CC were investigated for their electrochemical
properties in different pH media and evaluated for their capability
in practical primary and rechargeable zinc–air batteries. The
most active NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode can catalyze
the OER at an overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm–2 with good durability of over 160 h operations under an alkaline
condition. Moreover, the NiCo2S4 NS/CC electrode
still maintained its superior OER catalytic activity under the neutral
condition. The enhanced intrinsic catalytic properties, morphology-based
advantages of nanostructures, and the generation of the Ni–Co
oxyhydroxide active layer were considered responsible for the excellent
OER performance in water splitting. Especially, the in situ fabricated
NiCo2S4 NS/CC-integrated air cathode exhibits
excellent durability and electrocatalytic activity in zinc–air
batteries compared with the precious metal-based catalyst. This work
supports a snapshot of the rational design and construction of nonprecious
electrode materials with excellent catalytic activity and durability
for the future practical system toward OER in water electrolyzers
and zinc–air batteries.
