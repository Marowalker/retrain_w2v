In this report, the
dielectric nature of graphene oxide (GO) was
exploited for the successful implementation of low-power pentacene
thin-film transistors suitable for nonvolatile memory applications.
Two different types of devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide-coated
glass substrates with two different metals, viz., gold and aluminum,
as the source and drain contacts. The performance of the devices was
analyzed from their field-effect characteristics. Both the devices
showed dominant p-type charge transport behavior. The breakdown electric
field was determined to be 1.02 × 108 V/m. The current
transport mechanism was explained from the output characteristics
using the Fowler–Nordheim tunneling theory. Capacitance–voltage
(C–V) measurements have been
employed to determine the value of the oxide capacitance and to examine
the memory effect. The hysteresis behavior observed from the C–V characteristics show the suitability
of the device for memory applications with a low operating voltage
of 3 V. The charge trapping behavior of GO was explained by the energy
band diagram. Frequency-dependent C–V measurements in the range 100 kHz to 1 MHz were also performed
to account for the memory window obtained in the devices. The charge
retention and endurance characteristics were evaluated under a constant
voltage stress to check the reliability of device operation.

Introduction
Organic materials such
as conjugated π-electron systems,
small molecules, or polymers are of great interest because of their
wide chemical functionalities which help to tune the solubility, electrochemical,
morphological, and electrical properties.1,2 Devices
based on organic and polymeric materials have attracted much attention
in various electronic applications in recent years because of several
advantages like large area coverage, flexibility, low-temperature
processing, and low-cost processing.3,4 Recently, among
all the organic materials, pentacene (C22H14), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has been intensively studied
because of its high mobility and simple carrier transport.5 Pentacene has been ubiquitously used for different
applications like thin-film transistors (TFTs), sensors, solar cells,
and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices.6−9

In organic TFTs, device performance
can be improved by controlling
thin-film growth strategy, substrate temperature, and material purity;
however, further enhancement can be achieved by choosing a proper
substrate and dielectric material. So far as dielectric materials
are concerned, it should meet all the requirements applicable for
the fabrication of organic semiconductor devices, such as low-temperature
processing, mechanical flexibility, and solution processability such
as spin-coating, casting, and printing.10 Different organic and inorganic gate dielectric materials have been
reported so far in pentacene TFTs such as poly(methyl methacrylate),
polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and polyimides.11−13 However, most of them
require high-temperature processing. Graphene oxide (GO) is a well-known
derivative of graphene.14 GO is the intermediate
product which is derived during the synthesis of graphene from graphite.
It has widely been used in many devices as it has similar physical
properties like flexibility and robustness of graphene.15 During the oxidation of graphite, the oxygen
functional groups are incorporated into the layers of graphene that
results in the formation of GO. Carbon atoms with the hydroxyl and
epoxide functional groups lie in the basal planes, and the edges are
decorated with the carboxyl and carbonyl groups which provide hydrophilicity
and insulating property to GO.16 Therefore,
it can be dispersed in a wide range of solvents including deionized
(DI) water. Cote et al. demonstrated the Langmuir–Blodgett
assembly of GO single layers over Si wafer and explained the face-to-face
interaction of oxygen functional groups which may lead to the formation
of double layers.17 Hence, a monolayer
or few layers of GO can easily be deposited on various substrates
at low temperatures with control density by simple spin-coating. Recently,
Eda et al. reported electrical anisotropy and the dielectric properties
of GO and successfully fabricated graphene-based monolithic field-effect
transistors (FETs).18 Yang et al. reported
carbon nanotube transistors with GO as the gate dielectric material
for low-voltage operation and to achieve higher carrier mobility.19 Lee et al. used GO as the gate dielectric material
to fabricate flexible TFTs.20 Valtini et
al. reported planner organic metal oxide semiconductor FET on a paper
substrate with GO.21 GO also has the capacity
of charge storage for nonvolatile memory. Wang et al. used GO as a
charge-trapping dielectric for NVM.22 Lee
et al. demonstrated the hysteresis behavior of GO from the capacitance–voltage
characteristics.23

The transport
phenomena of thermally grown pentacene polycrystalline
thin films depend on different parameters such as charge carrier traps
at the semiconductor–dielectric interface, semiconductor film
microstructure, and trap generation because of the exposure to different
environments.24 Charge transport through
organic materials is not clearly understood because of their disordered
structure which creates large density of trap states, and it affects
the electrical behavior of the device. Different groups have tried
to explain how the transport properties depend on various factors
such as applied bias, trap densities,25 and temperature; further, to explain the transport phenomenon, different
models like phonon- or field-assisted variable-range hopping, multistep
hopping, space-charge-limited current, and Poole–Frankel model
have evolved.26−29 The choice of the source and drain electrode materials is very crucial
which depends on the nature of the channel material.30

In the present study, we have investigated the performance
of GO
as a gate dielectric, with the pentacene thin film as the channel
in a FET with indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass as the substrate.
The device performance was characterized with two different metal
electrodes, viz., Al and Au. The field-effect behavior of the device
was examined from the transfer characteristics, and the transport
mechanism of charge carriers was evaluated from the output characteristics.
Chemically derived GO served as charge trap centers which gives wide
memory window in capacitance–voltage characteristics. It is
observed that devices prepared with Au electrodes show better field-effect
performance with a channel mobility of 1.16 cm2 V–1 s–1 and a memory window of 2.2 V. Frequency-dependent C–V in the range from 100 kHz to
1 MHz was also performed to justify the consistency in memory behavior.

Results
and Discussion
The typical schematic device structure is
shown in Figure 1a.
We have fabricated two different
devices with the structure: (i) Al/pentacene/GO/ITO-coated glass and
(ii) Au/pentacene/GO/ITO-coated glass. The devices were labeled as
D1 and D2, respectively. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image of
the pentacene thin film is shown in Figure 1c, and the root mean square (rms) roughness
of the film was found to be 4.34 nm. The AFM image of GO thin film
over ITO-coated glass substrate is shown in Figure 1f. A ripple and wrinkle kind of morphology
was observed because of the presence of multilayer GO flakes. The
rms roughness was 5.84 nm for the GO layer. The thickness of the pentacene
thin film and dielectric GO was calculated as 80 and 400 nm, respectively,
which is shown in Figure 1b. The breakdown electric field was measured to validate the
use of GO as a gate dielectric in pentacene TFTs. For this, gate current
(Ig) was measured by applying a voltage
to the gate electrode. No enhancement of gate current was observed
from 0 to −3 V. However, after 3.3 V, the gate current was
found to increase, which is shown in Figure 1d. Finally, after 3.6 V, a sharp rise in
gate current was observed. The breakdown field was measured to be
1.02 × 108 V/m.

and Au electrodes for the device structure shown in the inset. (f)

The current density plot with the Al and Au contact electrodes
is shown in Figure 1e. The inset of Figure 1e shows the device structure from which the current–voltage
characteristics have been determined. The length and width of the
contact electrodes were taken as 0.1 and 0.5 cm, respectively. Higher
current density was observed with the Au contact electrode compared
to the Al electrode, which proves the suitability of Au contact for
device fabrication.

The output characteristics of the two devices
are shown in Figure 2a,b. For both the
devices, D1 and D2, the output characteristics show a linear behavior
of drain current (Ids) with a source–drain
voltage (Vds), and a significant enhancement
of the drain current was also observed with increasing gate voltage.
The conductance of the channel increases/decreases with an increase/decrease
in gate voltage (Vgs), which indicates
the enhancement mode operation of the devices. The output characteristic
shows dominant p-type conduction in both the devices. However, positive Vgs did not cause any enhancement in Ids, which is shown in Figure S1. Device D2 with Au as source and drain contacts shows a
higher drain current with the applied bias compared to D1 which was
made with Al source and drain contacts. It is due to the higher work
function of Au, better conductivity, and better resistance to oxidation
compared to Al.

electrode
and (b) D2 with Au electrode. ln(I/V2) vs 1/V plot for the device (c) D1
and (d) D2.

To understand the charge
conduction mechanism, we studied the transport
behavior in both the devices. In organic TFTs, the carrier transport
is mainly affected by two mechanisms: one is carrier injection through
the barrier of the metal–organic interface, and the other one
is multiple trapping of charge carriers inside the organic thin film.
To explain the transport mechanism, the output characteristics with
different gate voltages are analyzed with the Fowler Nordheim (F–N)
tunneling theory.31 In F–N tunneling,
the field emission current (J) density can be represented
as32 1  where ϕ is the work function, E denotes the applied electric field. And E can be
expressed as βV, where β represents the field
enhancement factor. A strong dependency of J was
observed on the applied bias, and it can be explained by the F–N
tunneling theory. Figure 2c,d shows the ln(I/V2) versus 1/V plot with different gate voltages
for the devices D1 and D2, respectively. In the FN plots, two distinct
regions were observed with the applied Vds. The linear region with a negative slope at a high electric field
for both the devices D1 and D2 represents the F–N tunneling.32 In the high field region with an increasing
applied field, the bands start to bend, and the barrier height between
GO and the pentacene layer increases which helps to form a narrow
potential well, resulting in a higher probability of F–N tunneling.
The regions of positive slope with a low applied electric field exhibit
multistep hopping governed by localized states.32

The switch point from where tunneling takes place
can be calculated
from the slope of the hopping and tunneling regions of ln(I/V2) versus 1/V plot. Figure 3a,b
shows the switch point data for the devices D1 and D2. For both the
devices, transition takes place at a lower Vds with increasing Vgs. A higher
probability of F–N tunneling was observed in device D2 compared
to D1. The slopes of the linear regions with different gate voltages
that have been calculated from both the curves from the F–N
plots are shown in Figure 4a,b. In the linear region, the slope corresponds to β–1ϕ3/2, and the tunneling current depends
on two factors, viz., field emission current and work function. The
dependency of tunneling current on these two factors has been analyzed
with the applied field. The height of the potential barrier is influenced
by band bending at the semiconductor dielectric interface which is
caused by an increase in Vgs. Tunneling
occurs when the barrier height is adequate for creating a narrow potential
barrier, a favorable condition for tunneling. However, the weightage
of individual factors in explaining the tunneling mechanism is not
very straightforward. The energy band diagrams of both the devices
D1 and D2 at equilibrium position are shown Figure 5a,b.

Figure 4c,d
shows
the transfer characteristics in which the device was biased at −2
V (Vds) and the gate voltage was varied
from −3 to +3 V. The field-effect mobility μFE can be calculated from the Ids1/2–Vgs plot. For a FET, the drain
current (Ids) in the linear regime at
a constant Vds is related to the relation33 2  where W/L is the width to length ratio, Cox is
the oxide capacitance per unit area, Vgs is the gate voltage, and VT is the threshold
voltage. Here, we have chosen the channel length and width as 100
and 500 μm, respectively. The oxide capacitance has been determined
to be 6 and 6.5 nF/Cm2 for D1 and D2, respectively, from
the capacitance versus voltage (C–V) measurements which are shown in Figure 6a,b. The capacitance is measured by a Keithley
4200 SCS with a parallel capacitance model at room temperature at
a signal frequency of 500 kHz under forward and reverse gate bias
sweeps without neglecting the leakage. The value of field-effect mobility
for both devices is found to be 0.85 and 1.16 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively. The insets of Figure 4c,d show the hysteresis
behavior of the transfer characteristics with Vds = −3 V. A memory window of 0.95 V was achieved for
device D1 and 1.05 V for device D2.

Figure 6 C–V characteristics of
devices: (a) D1 and (b) D2.

The memory behavior of the devices was studied from their
capacitance
versus voltage characteristics at room temperature at a signal frequency
of 500 kHz under forward and reverse gate bias sweeps. Here, the gate
voltage was varied by ±3, ±4, and ±5 V in both types
of devices. A small clockwise hysteresis of memory window of 0.8 V
in device D1 and 0.9 V in device D2 was observed at a sweep of ±3
V. Now, with an increasing voltage sweep, we have found significant
hysteresis memory windows in both the devices. Finally, a clockwise
hysteresis with maximum memory windows of 1.98 and 2.20 V was observed
upon applying the double sweep of maximum voltage of −5 to
+5 V, which is shown in Figure 6a,b. A flatband voltage shift was observed toward the positive
axis with increasing voltage sweep in both the devices. This indicates
the trapping of positive charge carriers with forward sweep and detrapping
via reverse sweep. However, the hysteresis behavior can be observed
because of the presence of surface states in the pentacene/GO interface.

To ensure the charge trapping in GO, we measured the frequency-dependent C–V characteristics which are shown
in Figure 7a,b. During
frequency dispersion on both the devices, a fixed voltage sweep of
±5 V was employed with a varying frequency range from 100 kHz
to 1 MHz. No frequency dispersion was observed in the accumulation
region and nearly a constant memory window was retained during the
experiment. Therefore, the surface states have a negligible contribution
to the hysteresis behavior. Thus, the observed hysteresis behavior
in both the devices is solely because of the charge trapping in GO
via FN tunneling from pentacene. A net positive or negative charge
is stored in the GO trap domains depending upon the applied positive
and negative gate voltages. If negative gate voltages are applied
through the bottom gate electrode, then holes are injected from the
Au and Al electrodes to the pentacene layer, and thus on applying
more negative gate voltages, there will be more holes in the pentacene
layer. Then, these holes are injected via FN tunneling to the energy
barrier of the GO layer and trapped in the trapping sites of the GO
domain. Now, applying positive gate voltages to the gate electrode,
the stored trapped charges in GO are released, causing a flatband
voltage shift. Schematically, these events are shown in Figure 8a,b.

(a) D1 and (b) D2.

Figure 8 Schematic energy band
diagrams for (a) negative and (b) positive Vg.

The trap charge density that is
increased by increasing the gate
voltage can be determined from Q = CΔVMW, where ΔVMW is the memory window.34 The
trapped charge densities were found to be 7.42 × 1010, 4.95 × 1010, and 3.37 × 1010 charged
traps/cm2 for Vg = 5, 4, and
3 V, respectively, in device D1 shown in Table 1. Similarly, they were 8.99 × 1010, 6.09 × 1010, and 3.99 × 1010 charged traps/cm2 in device D2 shown in Table 2. The injection of holes to
the pentacene layer from the Au electrode is more compared to that
from the Al electrode because the highest occupied molecular orbital
level of pentacene is much closer to the work function of Au than
that of Al, as shown in Figure 5a,b.

The charge retention properties of devices were measured
by applying
a constant voltage stress of ±10 V for 2 s. Figure 9a,b shows the charge retention
behavior and the flatband voltage shift for both the devices. The
flatband voltage shift was found to be 14.8 and 15.8 mV after 105 s for the devices D1 and D2, respectively. A small change
in the flatband voltage shift with time confirms that there is a low
trap charge generation at the interface. However, a higher change
in the flatband voltage in device D1 indicates more trap generation
at the interface compared to device D2. At the same time, only 17.5
and 14.2% charge loss was observed over a time period of 105 s for device D1 and device D2, respectively, which confirms the
excellent charge-trapping property of GO.

Figure 9 Charge retention and
flatband voltage characteristics of the devices:
(a) D1 and (b) D2.

To check the reliability
and stability of the devices, endurance
characteristics were evaluated by applying program and erase voltage
of ±10 V for 2 s, which is shown in Figure 10a,b. For device D1, the flatband voltage
shift during the programming and erasing cycle was 0.22 and 0.28 V,
respectively, after 103 cycles. After 103 cycles,
a gradual increase was found in the flatband voltage during programming.
This gradual increase can be explained by the fact that some of charge
carriers, which are not trapped by GO, are trapped in the semiconductor
dielectric interface. During the erasing operation, a slight enhancement
in the flatband voltage occurs which may be because of the incomplete
detrapping of carriers from the GO surface. For the device D2, the
flatband voltage shift was 0.18 and 0.24 V, respectively, during the
programming and erasing operations. A small change was observed in
the flatband voltage during the programming cycle upto 102 cycles. No further enhancement was found after 103 cycles,
which may be because of the reduction of the surface states in the
interface.

during P/E
operations.

Thus, the hysteresis
behavior and the high-density charged traps
in these devices indicate the effect of net charge trapping because
of the presence of the GO layer. During the oxidation of graphite
for the synthesis of GO by the Hummers method, a high concentration
of trap centers is generated.35 Because
of the oxidation in GO, sp2- and sp3-hybridized
carbon atoms of GO are attached with the hydroxyl and epoxide functional
groups in the basal planes, and the edges are connected with the carboxyl
and carbonyl groups.36 We have identified
oxygen functional groups present in GO from our earlier studies from
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic measurements, that is, νC=O = 1711 cm–1, νepoxy = 1230 cm–1, νOH = 3428 cm–1, and νC=C = 1647 cm–1.37 These functional groups greatly affect
the electronic and physical properties of GO. An extensive addition
of sp3 bonds (C–O) gives rise to an energy gap in
the electron density of states which makes completely oxidized GO
as a charge-trapping and insulating material. Moreover, during synthesis,
some structural defects are also generated in GO. These defects are
vacancy defects or interstitial sites in the GO domain. These defects
act like Coulombic scattering centers.23 By applying and increasing the gate voltage, the Coulombic potential
of charge traps can be increased, and subsequently more charges are
trapped in the GO domain by the trap centers.

Conclusions
We
have studied the performance of GO as a gate dielectric in thin
film FETs with the pentacene channel. The oxygen-containing functional
groups and defect states make GO an insulating material as well as
a charge-trapping element. The breakdown electric field of GO was
measured to be 1.02 × 108 V/m in a GO–pentacene
TFT. Field effect mobility was determined to be 1.16 and 0.85 cm2 V–1 s–1, respectively,
in the devices with Au and Al electrodes. The devices have been found
to operate at a voltage as low as 3 V. The transport study showed
the dominance of FN tunneling at a high electric field while the carriers
are transported by multistep hopping at a low gate bias. It is observed
that the defects in GO act as charge-trapping centers and a maximum
memory window of 2.20 V was obtained in the devices with the Au electrode.
The maximum trap charge density was found to be 8.99 × 1010 cm–2 with the device with Au. The frequency-dependent C–V measurements showed negligible
frequency dispersion in the obtained memory window. The charge loss
was observed as 17.5 and 14.2% for the devices with Al and Au source–drain
electrodes, respectively, after a cycle of 105 s. From
the endurance characteristics, the flatband voltage shift found during
the programming and erasing cycles was 0.22 and 0.28 V, respectively,
after 103 cycles with the Al electrode. After 103 cycles, a gradual enhancement was observed in the flatband voltage
shift. The flatband voltage shift was 0.18 and 0.24 V, respectively,
during the programming and erasing operations for the device with
Au after 102 cycles. The flatband voltage shift was found
to be consistent after 103 cycles, which confirms the reliability
of the Au device. Thus, the potential of GO as a gate dielectric having
several advantages, such as low cost, easy processability, and low-temperature
processing, makes it suitable for large-scale manufacturing in flexible
electronics industry and also demonstrates the capability of the system
for efficient nonvolatile memory applications.

Experimental Section
Device
Fabrication
GO was produced by the Hummers method.38 Pentacene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99% purity) is used
as the active material for device fabrication. The substrates were
first cleaned with acetone in an ultrasonication bath and then immersed
in 10% NaOH solution for 10 min. Finally, the substrates were thoroughly
rinsed in DI flow. For solution processing, 20 mg GO was dispersed
in DI water with a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL. GO was then deposited
by spin-coating on an ITO-coated glass substrate with a thickness
of 300–500 nm. The samples were further annealed at 50 °C
for 30 min to evaporate the water molecules from the GO solution.
Finally, pentacene was grown by thermal evaporation at room temperature
with a chamber pressure of 10–6 Torr. Two different
sets of devices were prepared. For the first set of devices, the source
and drain contacts were prepared on a pentacene thin film by evaporating
Al, and for the second set of devices, Au contacts were prepared through
a molybdenum mask. The channel length for both sets of the devices
was 100 μm and the width was taken as 500 μm. Surface
roughness in noncontact mode was observed by a Malcha Multiview atomic
force microscope. The thickness of the pentacene thin film and the
GO dielectric layer was evaluated from the cross-sectional image of
the fabricated device, which was recorded by a Carl Zeiss Supra 40
FESEM. Electrical measurements were carried out by a Keithley (4200
SCS) electrical parameter analyzer in voltage sweeping mode.
