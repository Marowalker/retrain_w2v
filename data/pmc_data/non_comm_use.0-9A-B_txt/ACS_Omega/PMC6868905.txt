The
high content of oxygen in the lignin polymer and the prevalence
of phenolic functional groups make the conversion of lignin to fuels
and value-added products with well-defined chemical properties challenging.
The lignin-to-liquid process using a water/formic acid reaction medium
has been shown to convert the lignin polymer to monomers with a molecular
weight range of 300–600 Da. The bio-oil comprises a complex
mixture of monomeric phenols, aromatics, and aliphatic hydrocarbons
with a high H/C and low O/C ratio. This study investigates the effect
of the stirring rate, level of loading, and catalyst at 305 and 350
°C in a 5 L pilot scale reactor. The oil yields are found to
be highest for experiments conducted using the maximum stirring rate,
maximum level of loading, and Ru/Al2O3 catalyst
with yields of more than 69 wt % on lignin intake. Goethite as a catalyst
does not show good conversion efficiency at either reaction temperatures.
The carbon recovery is highest for products produced at 305 °C.
Furthermore, results from solid phase extraction on a DSC-CN solid
phase show that 65–92 wt % the bio-oils can be recovered as
fractions separated based on polarity.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The
production and storage of biofuels and bulk chemicals from
sustainable, renewable, and naturally abundant lignocellulosic biomass
has been considered to be an outstanding option as a biorefinery feedstock
due to low costs and carbon neutrality.1−3

Lignocellulosic
biomass is composed of three main biopolymers,
cellulose (40–50 wt %), hemicellulose (15–25 wt %),
and lignin (15–35 wt %).1,4 In many biorefinery
concepts, the carbohydrate fraction of biomass (cellulose and hemicellulose)
is converted to bioethanol through the well-established lignocellulosic-to-ethanol
process, leaving behind lignin as waste.1,5,6 Lignin is an amorphous copolymer consisting of three
main aromatic units: p-hydroxyphenyl (H-lignin),
guaiacyl (G-lignin), and syringyl (S-lignin) units, which differ on
their methoxylation degrees. The monomers are connected through different
linkage patterns, depending on the biomass source and processing conditions.
However, the C–O–C and C–C bonds are the most
common bonding patterns in the lignin structure.7−9 Since the high
cost of cellulosic ethanol has limited its market, it would be essential
for the overall process economy to develop an efficient and appropriate
thermochemical method/catalytic technology for conversion of waste
lignin streams into fuels and chemicals such as aromatics, phenols,
aromatic ethers, vanillin, etc. However, the conversion technology
of lignin is still lagging behind.1−3

For conversion
of lignin or lignin-rich residues into value-added
functional materials, various thermochemical processes have been studied.10,11 However, pyrolysis or catalytic pyrolysis,12−15 liquefaction,16 gasification,17,18 solvolysis,19,20 and hydrogenolysis21,22 are among the most interesting
concepts investigated in this respect.

In 2008, Kleinert and
Barth reported a process termed Lignin-to-Liquid
(LtL), a thermochemical solvolytic process that comprises simultaneous
depolymerization of the lignin structures with subsequent hydrodeoxygenation
of the lignin monomers in a polar solvent such as water and alcohols.
Formic acid is used as a hydrogen donor, which has been proven to
be more reactive than molecular hydrogen. During the LtL process,
formic acid is converted in situ to molecular hydrogen and CO2/CO.23 Based on recent studies,
the decomposition of formic acid and the chemical reaction between
lignin and formic acid are competing reactions. Therefore, a formylation–elimination–hydrogenolysis
mechanism for the formic acid-aided lignin conversion is proposed.
Thus, carbon balances over 100 wt % indicate a potential carbon contribution
from formic acid to the conversion products.24,25

A recent study reported by Huang et al. (2014) showed that
the
addition of formic acid to a water–ethanol solvent mixture
has contributed to more than 90 wt % bio-oil yields from Kraft lignin
even without any catalysts.26 Riaz et al.
(2018) reported that the combined use of supercritical ethanol and
formic acid produced high amounts of lignin-derived monomers from
alkali lignin without using external catalysts and molecular hydrogen.
The complete lignin conversion resulted in high aromatic monomer yields
of 36.7 wt % on a dry ash-free lignin basis.27

However, the depolymerization behavior of lignin also is dependent
on the structure of lignin, and thus bio-oils produced from different
types of lignin are supposed to have different chemical compositions.
In a recent study, Park et al. (2018) reported that the content of
ether linkages in hardwood lignins was approximately three times higher
than that in softwood lignins due to the presence of sinapyl alcohol
units in hardwood lignins.28 Furthermore,
Park et al. reported that the content of ether linkages was also strongly
dependent on lignin isolation methods used where the highest bio-oil
yields were obtained from hardwood lignin isolated through formasolv
fractionation.28 On the contrary, Hita
et al. (2018) explored that enhanced monomer yields could be obtained
irrespective of the ether linkage content, and a high amount of β-O-4
linkages was actually shown to slightly reduce monomer yields.9

Moreover, several authors have reported
significantly improved
yields and reduced oxygen content of bio-oils using various types
of supported noble metal catalysts.29−31 However, the development
of cheap, sturdy, and environmentally friendly catalysts for the thermochemical
conversion of low-value feedstock to value-added products is still
an important issue. In a recent study from 2017, Agarwal et al. reported
that 92 wt % the product from the hydrotreatment of Kraft lignin at
450 °C using a limonite catalyst is detectable by GC–GC,
implying that the obtained bio-oil consists of low-molecular weight
compounds.32 Breunig et al. (2017) explored
that Fe-based catalysts were beneficial in order to prevent the char
formation in favor of higher oil yields in solvent-free hydrogenolysis
of different lignin types.33 Hita et al.
(2018) recently explored that alumina-based noble metal catalysts,
for example, Rh/Al2O3, Pd/Al2O3, Ru/Al2O3, and Pt/Al2O3, have given better results compared to carbon-supported ones,
for example, Rh/C, Pd/C, Ru/C, and Pt/C in terms of lignin oil yield
and composition.34 In another study from
2018, Hita et al. reported that 16–29 wt % the input lignin
can be converted into valuable platform chemicals through solvent-free
hydrotreatment using a Fe-based limonite catalyst at 450 °C and
4 h. Sixty-seven to eighty-one percent of lignin-oil components were
detectable by 2D GC–GC-FID in which low-molecular weight alkylphenolics
and aromatics were the main product fractions.9

The major challenge in developing an appropriate process for
lignin
conversion is to obtain high amounts of good quality oils while decreasing
the reaction temperature and time. The properties of good quality
oil can be defined as high energy content, high stability, low viscosity,
a high H/C and low O/C ratio, and a low average molecular weight.
Thus, the aim of this study is(1) to evaluate the yield, quality, and
composition of the bio-oils produced in the solvolytic conversion
of lignin at a 5 L scale as a function of the following reaction parameters:(i) Stirring rate: by
varying the stirring
rate from 0 to 1000 rpm.

(ii) Level of loading: by gradually increasing
the reactor loading.

(iii) Long-term storage of the raw material:
effect of two years of storage.

(iv) Investigation of two different catalysts,
Ru/Al2O3 and goethite.



(2) to separate the volatile
low molecular
weight oil components from the heavier nonvolatile fraction of the
bio-oil using solid phase extraction (SPE) and then identifying the
individual fractionated compounds using gas chromatography–mass
spectroscopy analysis.



In a previous
study reported by Ghoreishi et al. (2019), the highest
oil yields from the Eucalyptus lignin-rich residue were achieved at
reaction temperatures up to 350 °C.35 Thus, all experiments related to this study are conducted at reaction
temperatures up to 350 °C. In another study reported by Ghoreishi
et al. (2019), stirred reactions (400 rpm) were shown to yield higher
amounts of oils compared to nonstirred reactions (0 rpm), and in the
same study, a positive correlation was observed between the level
of loading in the reactor and the oil yield.36 Therefore, a more detailed exploration of the effect of stirring
and reactor loading on LtL solvolysis is one of the main objectives
of this research paper. Goethite is an iron-based mineral with catalytic
properties, which consists predominantly of α-FeOOH. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first to compare a conventional
noble metal catalyst with goethite as a catalyst for thermochemical
conversion and to demonstrate this at a 5 L scale.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Product Yields
The feedstock used
in this study is not directly soluble in the reaction media at low
temperatures, and thus the initial state of the reaction in the LtL
process is a suspension of lignin particles in the liquid reaction
medium. While the physical state of the reaction system at the selected
temperatures is not precisely known, torque readings during the heating
period indicate that lignin melts into a viscous liquid and dissolves
due to increased solubility at higher temperatures. The quantitative
results from all LtL-process experiments are presented in Figure 1 and Table S1.

and lignin mass balances
as mass fractions of lignin input as a function of (1.1) different
stirring rates at 305 °C, (1.2) different levels of loading in
the reactor at 350 °C, (1.3) long-term storage of the feedstock
at both 305 and 350 °C, and (1.4) catalyst use at both 305 and
350 °C. (For coding see Table 2.)

2.1.1 Effect
of the Stirring Rate on Oil and Solid
Yields
The effect of five different stirring conditions on
product yields are shown in Figure 1-1.1, which gives a comparison of oil and char yields
on a lignin basis, together with the organic mass balances (in wt
%) from all experiments performed in this section. Experiments shown
in Figure 1-1.1 are
performed at the same reaction conditions (305 °C and 2 h), while
the stirring rate is changed stepwise from 0 rpm (nonstirred) to 1000
rpm.

The oil and char yields range from 44 to 67 wt % and from
12 to 24 wt % on a lignin basis, respectively. The original lignin
mass recovered as oil and char lies in the range of 65–78 wt
%. The unaccounted mass will comprise the gas phase and aqueous products,
including water produced in the thermal decomposition reactions. For
this reason, determining an accurate mass balance for all products
is difficult, and the carbon recovery data presented below is more
relevant for an overall evaluation of yields.

Overall, the oil
yields tend to increase as a function of an increased
stirring rate and are consistently much higher for experiments with
a stirring rate above 400 rpm. Furthermore, char formation decreases
significantly as a function of an increased stirring rate when all
other reaction parameters are kept constant. The increased oil yields
and decreased char yields can be attributed to better mass transfer
due to more efficient stirring. For oil yields, an increase of approximately
20 wt % on a lignin basis is observed when the stirring rate is increased
from 0 to 1000 rpm. In addition, the organic mass balance is also
increased as a function of an increased stirring rate. Thus, to produce
a high amount of oil and a low amount of char, high stirring rates
are preferred.

2.1.2 Effect of the Different
Loadings in the
Reactor on Oil and Solid Yields
Product yields on lignin
intake, together with the organic mass balances (wt %) are shown in Figure 1-1.2. The ratio of
lignin to the reaction medium is kept constant. The only difference
between experiments shown in Figure 1-1.2 is the degree of filling in the reactor, while
all the other conditions are kept constant (350 °C with a stirring
rate of 400 rpm and 2 h).

The oil and char yields are in the
range of 28 to 62 wt % and 11 to 31 wt %, respectively, on a lignin
basis. In addition, over 70 wt % the original lignin mass is directly
recovered as oil and char in the maximum level-loaded experiment.
The results show that increasing the loading in the reactor from a
minimum to a maximum level when keeping the other reaction parameters
constant gives an impressive increase in bio-oil yields. This can
be due to a higher operating pressure when the reactor is loaded to
a high level, see Table S1. The reactor
used in this work is equipped with two stirrers above each other on
the stirring rod. When the reactor is loaded at the maximum level,
the contact of both stirrers with the reaction medium will result
in a more efficient mixing of the reactants, improving lignin depolymerization.
Since the level of loading in the reactor also influences the pressure
in the reactor, an increase in the amount of the reaction medium will
increase the pressure inside the reactor, which improves the efficiency
of the reaction.

A maximum increase of approximately 34 wt %
in the oil yield on
a lignin basis is observed as a function of reactor filling from a
minimum level to a maximum level. In terms of char yields, a decrease
of approximately 20 wt % on a lignin basis is observed. However, no
significant variation in the char yield is observed as a function
of increased reactor loading from the medium to maximum level. Since
an optimal lignin conversion comprises a high oil yield and a low
char yield, high loading levels are preferable.

2.1.3 Reproducibility as a Function of Long-Term
Storage of the Feedstock
In this part of the study, an experiment
from each section above is duplicated to examine the effect of prolonged
storage of the raw material on the reproducibility.

The quantitative
results presented in Figure 1-1.3 show some variations between the duplicate experiments
due to long-term storage of the feedstock. The difference in the organic
mass balance between experiments performed at 305 °C is approximately
13 wt % on a lignin basis. These observations indicate that the composition
of the raw material has changed during storage, which shows that results
from conversion tests over time cannot be assumed to be reproducible
and comparisons should be done with considerable caution.

2.1.4 Effect of the Catalyst on Oil and Solid
Yields
The effect of two different catalysts, Ru/Al2O3 and goethite, on product yields and organic mass balances
is investigated for some selected reaction conditions (see Table 2) and compared with
the noncatalyzed experiments performed at the same reaction conditions.

Comparison of the results obtained from noncatalyzed and catalyzed
experiments at 305 °C show that the oil yield on lignin intake
decreases to a small extent when using goethite as a reaction catalyst,
ca. 3 wt %, and increases significantly when using Ru/Al2O3, ca. 13 wt %. For the experiments performed at 350
°C, an increase is observed for the oil yield as a function of
catalyst use to a small extent by using goethite, 4 wt %, and considerably
when using Ru/Al2O3, ca. 35 wt %. However, char
yields increase, approximately 3–5 wt %, when using goethite
as the catalyst, and decrease significantly, ca. 13–15 wt %,
when using Ru/Al2O3 at both reaction temperatures.
Thus, the effect of Ru/Al2O3 catalyst is positive
at both reaction temperatures giving oil and char yields in the range
of 69–72 and 9–11 wt % on a lignin basis, respectively.
This positive effect can be explained by the fact that reaction pathways
and kinetics of the lignin decomposition is influenced by the catalyst.31 The first step in lignin solvolysis is a fast
depolymerization of the lignin structure, which is followed by competing
reactions giving hydrodeoxygenation or repolymerization of the depolymerized
monomers. Use of catalyst in the LtL process probably reduces the
activation energy of the hydrodeoxygenation process, thereby reducing
the likelihood of repolymerization of depolymerized lignin monomers.

In addition, the organic mass balances do not appear to be significantly
affected by the catalysts in the experiments performed at 305 °C
while showing an increasing trend with catalyst use in the experiments
performed at 350 °C. Nevertheless, the production of a high amount
of oil and a low amount of char is the optimum result, so Ru/Al2O3 is the preferred catalyst for conversion of
lignin to bio-oil at the selected reaction conditions.

Furthermore,
an additional experiment was performed to combine
the best reaction conditions obtained in each previous section, namely,
experiment Ru/Al2O3.S1000.Max.305. Results obtained
from this experiment show a significant increase in the oil yield
on a lignin basis compared to experiments NC.S1000.L.305, NC.S400.Max.350,
and Ru/Al2O3.S400.L.305. The highest oil yield
(79 wt %) and consequently the highest organic mass balance (89 wt
%) is achieved in this experiment. However, the char yield does not
seem to be affected by the reaction condition changes in the same
degree as the oil yield.

2.1.5 Comparison with the Published
Literature
The main purpose of this study is to find reaction
conditions that
are most beneficial in terms of product yield and product quality.
Results presented in this study show that the bio-oil yields lie in
the range of 28–83 wt % on lignin intake. These results are
quite comparable with results obtained from similar conversion processes
reported by other research groups. Though most of the high-yield results
reported are catalyzed, Huang et al. reported in 2014 that more than
90 wt % the Kraft lignin has been converted to bio-oil using formic
acid and a mixture of water/ethanol as a reaction solvent even without
the use of a catalyst.26 Among the noncatalyzed
experiments investigated in this study, experiment NC.S1000.L.305
has given the highest bio-oil yield (approximately 67 wt % on lignin
intake) using a stirring rate of 1000 rpm and low level of loading
in the reactor at 305 °C. The differences between the results
presented in this paper and results reported by Huang et al. are most
likely due to the use of different types of raw materials, impure
Eucalyptus lignin versus Kraft lignin. Quantitative comparison of
the results reported in these two studies may become difficult due
to the differences in procedure and reaction parameters, for example,
different reaction temperatures (305/350 °C vs 200–330
°C), reaction solvents (water vs 50:50 water/ethanol mixture),
stirring rates (0–1000 rpm vs 200 rpm), and reactor size (5
L vs 0.01 L). In addition, the recovery values have most probably
been influenced by the use of acetone as an extracting solvent such
as in the work by Huang et al. (2014) rather than the less polar ethyl
acetate/THF mixture used in this study. Acetone as a solvent will
incorporate a wider range of oligomeric degradation products in the
depolymerized lignin fraction and consequently give higher bio-oil
yields.

In 2015, Oregui-Bengoechea et al. explored that the
supported noble metal catalysts have significantly improved the bio-oil
yields on a lignin basis with yields up to approximately 92 wt % the
input lignin using Ru/Al2O3 at 340 °C and
a reaction time of 6 h.31 As reported here,
the supported catalyst, Ru/Al2O3, also has significantly
improved the bio-oil yields with the highest oil yield obtained in
experiment Ru/Al2O3.S1000.Max.305. Higher reaction
temperatures along with longer reaction times used by Oregui-Bengoechea
et al. have most likely led to a more efficient degradation of lignin
and thus have given a higher amount of lignin-derived oils.

In a study from 2018 performed by Hita et al., the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst is reported as the best catalyst in terms
of lignin oil yields and composition compared to other noble metal-based
catalysts through solvent-free hydrotreatment of Kraft lignin at 450
°C and 4 h. The most promising result obtained was a lignin oil
yield of approximately 36 wt % and 5 wt. % DCM soluble products on
lignin intake, both being rich in valuable chemical compounds such
as alkylphenolics, aromatics, oxygenates, and alkanes determined using
GC–GC-FID.34 However, Kristianto
et al. (2017) reported that approximately 66 wt % of CAHL (concentrated
acid hydrolysis lignin) can be converted to bio-oil using Ru/C as
the catalyst in a formic acid/ethanol reaction medium.3 In addition, Kristianto et al. (2017) explored that the
oil yield increased as a function of an increased formic acid amount
and prolonged reaction time in the presence of Ru/C, while the oxygen
content of the bio-oil was shown to be reduced, substantially.3 Results reported by Kristianto et al. (2017)
are quite comparable with results obtained in this study from experiments
performed using Ru/Al2O3 (with oil yields of
approximately 69, 72, and 79 wt % on a lignin basis). Additionally,
the monomeric composition of the lignin oils produced in the latter
study consisted mainly of phenol and its derivatives, including methyl,
ethyl, and methoxy-substituted phenols, indicating the comparability
of these oils.

2.2 Elemental Analysis and
Carbon Recovery
The Van Krevelen diagram in Figure 2 displays H/C and O/C ratios
of all bio-oils and the
starting lignin feedstocks. The elemental composition of all oil and
char samples is given in Table S2.

Figure 2 Van Krevelen
diagram showing H/C and O/C ratios of the LtL oils
and feedstock.

Figure 2 shows that
the difference in hydrogen and oxygen contents between the raw materials
is prominent. The higher content of hydrogen and oxygen in the fresh
lignin is attributed to a higher content of carbohydrates in this
feedstock. Thus, the significant decrease in the H/C ratio and the
moderate reduction in the O/C ratio of the biomass after prolonged
storage can be due to microbial/bacterial degradation of the carbohydrate
residues that were present in the raw material.

The Van Krevelen
diagram in Figure 2 also depicts a distinct reduction of oxygen content
in the bio-oils relative to the starting biomasses, confirming the
occurrence of deoxygenation during the LtL process. Although the H/C
ratio of the bio-oils produced from stored lignin seems to have increased
to some extent due to bulk hydrogenation of the starting feedstock,
this does not seem to have occurred when using fresh lignin since
the H/C ratio of the bio-oils have been reduced slightly relative
to the starting material. The lower H/C ratio of the bio-oils compared
to the fresh lignin can be caused by the elimination of hydrogen as
an aqueous product, that is, water, methanol, short-chain organic
acids, and furfural from the degraded carbohydrate residues. During
the Lignin-to-Liquid process, hydrogen can both be added and removed.
The thermal decomposition of formic acid gives highly reactive in
situ hydrogen, which is responsible for conversion of lignin constituents
into hydrogen-rich, oxygen-depleted products. Nevertheless, hydrogen
can also be removed as an aqueous product by cleaving hydroxyl groups
from the lignin structure. Since the carbon content of the bio-oils
(66.77–75.41 wt %) produced in this work has increased compared
to the carbon content of the starting raw materials (50.12–52.29
wt %), it is unlikely that hydrogen that is bound to carbon has been
removed as an alcohol and/or aldehyde during the conversion process.
In addition, as given in Table S2, the
content of oxygen is reduced from, for example, 39.14 and 37.72 wt
% in the raw material to a range of 16.07–24.39 wt % in the
lignin-derived oils, and thus much of the mass loss will be due to
loss of oxygen. The H/C value is in the range of 1.11–1.47,
suggesting that aromatic rings can be predominant.

In addition,
a trend of reduction in the O/C ratio is observed
as a function of increased reaction temperature when all other reaction
parameters are kept constant. Comparison of experiment NC-1.S400.L.305
with experiment NC-1.S400.L.350 shows a reduction in the O/C ratio
and an increase in the H/C ratio indicating that the lignin structure
degradation is more intense at higher temperatures. However, the same
trend is not common when comparing experiment NC-2.S400.L.305 with
experiment NC-2.S400.L.350 where both H/C and O/C ratios have decreased
as a function of the reaction temperature increase.

A general
observation is that the O/C value of the bio-oils does
not seem to be influenced by the variations in reactor loading, while
the H/C values appear to be more affected. However, variation in the
H/C ratio does not follow a specific trend with the highest H/C ratio
obtained in experiment NC.S400.Min.350. In the case of experiments
performed under different stirring conditions, the H/C ratio of the
oils has shown an increasing trend as a function of an increased stirring
rate with the lowest H/C ratio for oil produced in experiment NC.NS.L.305,
while the O/C ratio shows an increasing trend from experiment NC.NS.L.305
to experiment NC.S100.L.305 and then a trend of reduction.

No
significant variation in the H/C and O/C ratios of bio-oils
has been observed as a function of catalyst use (catalyzed vs noncatalyzed)
and catalyst type (goethite vs ruthenium on alumina) when keeping
other parameters constant, confirming that the distribution of the
elemental composition is primarily based on the temperature of the
conversion process. However, among all experiments conducted at 305
°C (both catalyzed and noncatalyzed), the highest H/C ratio belongs
to experiment Ru/Al2O3.S1000.Max.305 indicating
that a combination of the maximum stirring rate and maximum level
of loading in the reactor leads to better hydrogenation of the lignin-derived
components.

In addition to recovery by mass, carbon balance
calculations are
also performed for all LtL-process experiments carried out in this
work, see Table 1.
Mass fractions (wt %) of carbon in raw materials, bio-oils, and solid
products (chars) are determined using elemental compositional data.
The carbon balance data includes input of carbon in the form of lignin
and output of carbon in the form of organic products (bio-oils and
chars) and thus will be dependent on the product recovery by mass.
However, a major source of uncertainty is the lack of data for aqueous
and gas-phase products. In a study reported by Løhre et al. (2017),
high levels of dissolved organic carbons are detected in the aqueous
phase using 1H NMR analysis.25 The results from 1H NMR have shown a presence
of methanol, ethanol, and considerable amounts of aromatics and carboxylic
acids in addition to the extraction solvents, ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran.25 Hydrogenation of a methoxy substituent in methoxyphenol
will lead to the formation of phenol and methanol. The methanol formed
will be found in the aqueous phase and will be removed during a work-up
procedure.37 However, the other components
such as aromatics and carboxylic acids are believed to originate from
lignin and formic acid, respectively. Therefore, due to lack of aqueous
phase analysis, the carbon balance data are most useful for comparative
use.

Calculations
show a carbon balance ranging from 75 to 108 wt %.
Carbon balances over 100 wt % indicate a potential carbon contribution
from formic acid to bio-oils. As given in Table 1, the carbon balance has increased considerably
as a function of an increased stirring rate (from 89 to 108 wt %),
which can indicate better incorporation of carbon from formic acid
to the lignin structure at elevated stirring conditions. Changes in
the carbon balance as a function of different levels of loading in
the reactor did not show to follow a specific trend. However, a carbon
balance of approximately 101 wt % has been achieved in the experiment
performed at the maximum level of loading (NC.S400.Max.350). Moreover,
carbon balance does not seem to have been affected by catalyst use
at 305 °C. Meanwhile, comparison of the catalyzed experiments
with the noncatalyzed experiments performed at 350 °C showed
that the carbon balance increased by approximately 10. and 24.7 wt
% when using goethite and Ru/Al2O3 as catalysts,
respectively.

2.3 Bio-Oil Composition from
Gas Chromatography–Mass
Spectrometry
The more volatile compounds of the bio-oils
have been identified using GC–MS analysis. The LtL oils comprise
a complex mixture of phenolic compounds. Figure 3 shows chromatograms containing representative
compound distributions from six different bio-oils. The chromatograms
presented in Figure 3 show that the composition of the GC–MS detectable part of
the bio-oils is quite similar in different oils performed at the same
reaction temperature, while the abundance varies with other reaction
conditions, for example, catalyst type, stirring rate, and level of
loading in the reactor.

Figure 3 GC–MS chromatograms of (3.1) experiment
NC-1.S400.L.305
at the top, (3.2) experiment Goethite.S400.L.305 in the middle, and
(3.3) experiment Ru/Al2O3.S400.L.305 at the
bottom.

The GC–MS analysis confirms
the results obtained by elemental
analysis. Figure 3-3.1–3.3
illustrates this, showing that the most abundant compounds are the
same in oils performed at 305 °C regardless of catalysis conditions
(bio-oils from experiment: NC-1.S400.L.305, Goethite.S400.L.305, and
Ru/Al2O3.S400.L.305). However, the proportion
of the compounds relative to the internal standard (hexadecane) varies
between the oils in a way that can tentatively be explained by the
effect of different catalysis conditions. Furthermore, GC–MS
chromatograms shown in Figure 4 confirm also that the composition of the GC–MS detectable
part of oils produced at 350 °C is quite similar, while the abundance
varies as a function of raw material freshness, loaded level in the
reactor, and catalyst use. Since the profile of the monomers is essentially
the same for catalyzed and noncatalyzed experiments, the main effect
of the catalyst is interpreted to be hydrogenation of the depolymerized
lignin monomers. The stabilization of the depolymerized lignin monomers
through hydrodeoxygenation reactions hinders their repolymerization
into char.31 Therefore, the higher bio-oil
yields obtained in the catalyzed experiments can mainly be due to
the catalyst activity in the formic acid-aided aliphatic ether bond
cleavage.

Figure 4 GC–MS chromatograms of (4.1) experiment NC.S400.L.350 at
the top, (4.2) experiment NC-2.S400.L.350 in the middle, and (4.3)
experiment Ru/Al2O3.S400.L.350 at the bottom.

A general observation is that 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol,
#6) is
the most abundant compound in almost all of the chromatograms depicted
in Figures 3 and 4. GC–MS chromatograms depicted in Figure 3-3.1–3.3 show
that the bio-oils produced at 305 °C consist mainly of methoxy-substituted
phenols in high concentrations. The compounds numbered as 1, 2, and
4 (five-membered rings) are most probably degradation products from
the sugar residues in the raw material. In addition to guaiacol (#6),
2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (#9), 4-ethyl-2-methoxyphenol (#10), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol
(#11), and 2-methoxy-4-propylphenol (#12) are the most abundant compounds
identified in the bio-oils performed at 305 °C. In addition,
catechol (#18) is also one of the major components in the bio-oil
produced using goethite. However, the proportion of these compounds
relative to 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol) differs between the bio-oils
produced at different reaction conditions. The higher content of oxygen
in oils produced at 305 °C results in higher O/C ratios of the
oils, confirming the results obtained from elemental analysis, shown
in Figure 2. Compounds
identified as #16 (a fatty acid methyl ester) and #17 (a fatty acid)
are present in all bio oils produced at 305 ° C from fresh Eucalyptus
lignin. These two components are most probably products derived from
plant waxes, which have been degraded by the microorganisms present
in the feedstock. This observation confirms the results presented
in Figure 2, which
show that the H/C ratio of lignin is significantly reduced after a
two-year storage period that may be due to the consumption of plant
fat by living microorganisms.

Identification of the most abundant
peaks in the bio-oils produced
at 350 °C show a higher amount of alkylated phenols. Phenol (#3),
2,3-dimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one (#4), methyl- and ethylphenol (#5
and #9), 3-propylphenol (#30), 2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-ol
(#19), and butylated hydroxytoluene (#15) are the most abundant compounds
identified in the chromatograms shown in Figure 4-4.1–4.3. The higher content of hydrogen
in bio-oils produced at 350 °C results in significantly higher
H/C ratios of the oils, corroborating again the results obtained from
the elemental analysis.

2.4 In-Depth Analysis of the
Solid Phase-Extracted
Bio-Oil Fractions Using GC–MS Analysis
Figure 5 shows a schematic illustration
of the results obtained from the solid phase extraction where fraction
1 contains the least polar compounds and fraction 4 contains the most
polar compounds eluted from the column.

Figure 5 Mass percentage of the
four different fractions based on the bio-oil
input.

As shown in Figure 5, more than 65 wt % the input bio-oils are
fractionated using the
eluents given in Section 4.5.3. However, the bio-oil produced in experiment NC-2.S400.L.305
was shown to have the highest degree of elution on bio-oil intake
(above 90 wt %). A general observation is that bio-oils from noncatalyzed
experiments have shown better recovery from separation using normal-phase
fractionation compared to bio-oils from catalyzed experiments performed
at the same reaction temperature. In addition, bio-oils produced at
350 °C seem to contain a larger proportion of nonpolar or less-polar
fractions (fractions 1 and 2) in comparison with bio-oils produced
at 305 °C. Furthermore, there are no significant differences
observed in the quantity of the different fractions between the catalyzed
experiments performed at the same reaction temperature. Nevertheless,
increased reaction temperature from 305 to 350 °C seems to have
positively influenced the tendency of fractionation of bio-oils produced
using catalysts. In addition, Figure 5 shows that approximately 10–35 wt % the input
bio-oils either is left in the SPE column (are not eluted using the
most polar eluent) or consists of volatile components that have evaporated
along with the separation solvents. Thus, the amount of the collected
fractions and the rest left in the SPE column can again confirm that
approximately 80 wt % the bio-oils consists of polar phenolic compounds.
The majority of the polar phenolic compounds in the bio-oils are hard
to quantify using gas chromatography due to poor GC properties. However,
silylation of the polar compounds enhances the elution properties
and has improved the quantification of the different phenolic compounds.

Figure 6 depicts
that the composition of the fractionated samples also depends on the
reaction temperature used during production of the bio-oils. Based
on results from GC–MS analysis, bio-oils produced at 350 °C
contain many phenolic compounds that are not found and/or identified
in fraction 2 from bio-oils produced at 305 °C. This observation
confirms the results shown in Figure 5, indicating that the portion of fraction 2 increases
with increased reaction temperature from 305 to 350 °C.

Figure 6 GC–MS
chromatograms of fraction 2 from experiment Goethite.S400.L.350
at the top and experiment Goethite.S400.L.305 at the bottom.

A general observation is that the majority of compounds
identified
on the right side of the GC–MS chromatograms from fraction
2 are fatty acids and alcohols with long hydrocarbon chains. This
observation is expected since the polarity of alcohols and carboxylic
acids decrease with the chain length increase. In addition, based
on results obtained from elemental analysis, bio-oils produced at
305 °C have a higher content of oxygen and therefore are expected
to be poorly eluted with a nonpolar or less polar eluent such as hexane:DCM
(90:10 v:v).

Figure 7 shows that
the most abundant components identified by GC–MS in fraction
3 from experiment NC-2.S400.L.350 at the top, experiment Ru/Al2O3.S400.L.350 in the middle, and experiment Goethite.S400.L.350
at the bottom are quite similar and independent of the reaction temperature
and catalyst use. Furthermore, the GC–MS-identified compounds
seem to be more polar compared to the compounds identified in fraction
2 (shown in Figure 6), which is expected due to increased polarity of the eluent. The
major components identified in fraction 3 are catechol (#3), 3,5-dihydroxytoluene
(#4), 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenol (#5), and 2-hydroxymandelic acid ethyl
ester (#8).

bottom.

3 Conclusions
The aim of this study was to provide an insight into the impact
of different reaction conditions on LtL solvolysis conducted at a
5 L pilot scale. The overall result shows a major increase in the
oil yield and a significant decrease in the char yield as a function
of an increased stirring rate at 305 °C, increased reactor loading
at 350 °C, and use of Ru/Al2O3 at both
reaction temperatures. A general observation is that the oil yield
decreases as a function of increased reaction temperature due to repolymerization
of lignin components for char formation at higher reaction temperatures.
The use of goethite as a reaction catalyst does not affect the oil
and char yields at either reaction temperatures. However, Ru/Al2O3 has been found to be very efficient for LtL
solvolysis showing the highest oil yields and the lowest char yields.

Furthermore, the significant reduction in the H/C ratio of the
feedstock from storage over time, which can be due to degradation
of carbohydrate residues and/or plant waxes, did not affect the H/C
ratios of the bio-oils significantly. Results from elemental analysis
and GC–MS analysis show effective deoxygenation and depolymerization
when comparing the starting material with the produced bio-oils. However,
for bio-oils produced from fresh lignin, bulk hydrogenation did not
seem to have occurred since the H/C ratio of the bio-oils was also
reduced relative to the starting material. In addition, the H/C ratio
of the oils has not been influenced by the use of a catalyst. An increase
in the H/C ratio has been found as a function of an increased stirring
rate due to an increased reaction rate and improved mass transfer.
Guaiacol is the major component in most of the LtL oils. The most
abundant compounds identified in bio-oils produced at 305 °C
are mainly alkyl-substituted methoxyphenols. However, alkylated phenols
are the most abundant compounds identified in the bio-oils produced
at 350 °C. One of the main benefits of bio-oil production at
a 5 L scale is the large product volume, which makes testing of different
separation, fractionation, and upgrading processes, for example, distillation
and solid phase extraction, possible. Overall, the results from SPE
show good perspectives for further development and indicate that other
separation methods such as flash chromatography can even be more suitable
for separation of the bio-oil components.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Chemicals
Formic acid (mass fraction
of ≥98%), ethyl acetate (mass fraction of >99.8%), and tetrahydrofuran
(mass fraction of >99.9%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used
without any further purification.

4.2 Catalysts
Ruthenium on alumina (Ru
mass fraction of 5%, catalogue no. 381152, and batch no. Lot#10714KYV),
and goethite (Fe mass fraction 30–63%, catalogue no. 71063,
and batch no. Lot#BCBQ8228V) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used without any further work-up.

4.3 Feedstock
The feedstock used in this
work is a lignin-rich residue isolated from weak acid and enzymatic
hydrolysis of Eucalyptus wood, which was produced at the Biorefinery
Demo Plant (BDP) in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. The lignin
content of the feedstock was estimated from elemental composition
to be ∼50.1 wt %. The ash content of the feedstock was determined
to be approximately 4.4 wt % according to protocol NREL/TP-510-42622.38 Eucalyptus lignin was received as a wet sample
and was dried in an oven at 60 °C until constant mass before
further grinding and sieving to a dry powder of <500 μm in
particle size. The dried lignin powder was used without further purification.

The H/C and O/C ratios of the feedstock were 1.41 and 0.59 when
fresh and 1.13 and 0.54 after long-term storage. The high oxygen content
of this feedstock compared to pure lignin is attributed to a certain
amount of residual sugars/carbohydrates.

4.4 Lignin
to Liquid Solvolysis System and Conditions
4.4.1 Experimental
Conditions
Lignin
(150–350 g), formic acid (183–427 g), water (375–875
g), and the catalyst (ca. 5 g) were added to a stirred 5 L high-pressure
autoclave reactor from ESTANIT GmbH. The autoclave was then closed
and heated to the desired temperatures (305–350 °C) with
a stirring rate of 0–1000 rpm for a reaction time of 2 h. The
heating time from room temperature to the desired temperature (305–350
°C) was tested in a range of 60–70 min, giving an approximate
heating rate of 5 °C min–1. The reaction time
(2 h) was measured in addition to the heating period. The pressure
and torque of the stirrer were continuously monitored during the experiments.
The maximum level of loading in the reactor is defined by the pressure
limits of the equipment. The experimental conditions of all the experiments
are given in Table 2. The experiments are coded as shown below:

4.4.2 Sample Work-Up
After the completed
reaction time, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature by flowing
cold water through the reactor’s cooling coil. The final products
from the LtL process consisted of a gas phase, a liquid phase, and
a solid phase (containing both the unreacted starting material and
char produced during the conversion). However, previous results indicate
that the bulk of the solid phase will mainly be char.39 The produced gas was vented by opening the gas valve. Analysis
of the gas composition was not performed as a part of this study,
but relevant data for the gas composition can be found in a previous
work reported by Oregui-Bengoechea et al. (2015) showing that decomposition
of formic acid is the source of the major part of the produced gas.31

After the gas phase was vented, the reactor
was opened and the liquid phase was separated from the solid phase.
The liquid phase consisted of a single aqueous phase and the LtL oil
was adsorbed to the solid phase. The liquid phase was separated from
the solid phase by opening the valve on the container bottom. Then,
the organic phase was extracted by adding a solution of ethyl acetate:tetrahydrofuran
(90:10 v/v), and the solid phase was filtered off.

The extracted
organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated
at a reduced pressure (20–25 kPa)
at 40 °C to yield a dark brown liquid. The final oil and solid
yields were determined by mass after solvent evaporation and drying
and are given in a mass fraction percentage, as specified in eq 1. 1  

The solid yield for the catalyzed systems was calculated after
subtracting the amount of catalyst introduced and thus refers to the
organic solids (char). The mass balance was calculated as the sum
of oil and char mass fractions.

4.5 Characterization
of the Products
4.5.1 Elemental Analysis
All samples
were analyzed for their elemental composition in the CHNS mode with
a Vario EL III instrument using helium as the carrier gas. The amount
of oxygen was calculated by the difference of CHN.

4.5.2 Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectroscopy
The LtL
oils (1.0 mg) were dissolved in 1 cm3 ethyl
acetate:tetrahydrofuran (90:10 v/v) with hexadecane (1 μL/L)
as the internal standard, and the sample was analyzed using an Agilent
Technologies 7890A GC system with an autosampler coupled with an Agilent
5977A mass-selective detector (MSD). The injection was run in the
splitless mode at 280 °C (injector temperature) on a 30 m HP-5ms
column with 250 μm i.d. and thickness of 0.25 μm from
Agilent Technologies. The following GC–MS instrumental conditions
were applied:

Start temperature: 40 °C (held for 5 min),
heating rate 1: 6 °C min–1 to 280 °C,
and heating rate 2: 40 °C min–1 to 300 °C
(held for 5 min).

The GC–MS interphase valve delay was
set to 4.60 min and
the MS detector was operated in the positive mode at 70 eV with an
ion-source temperature of 250 °C. Compounds were identified using
Enhanced MSD Chemstation software F.01.00.1903 and the NIST 2.0 library.

4.5.3 Solid Phase Extraction
In this
work, normal-phase separation has been applied using a column material
consisting of silica modified with cyanopropyl groups, which is more
suitable than silica and C18 columns for separation of lignin-derived
compounds due to its intermediate polarity.

Approximately 70
mg of the LtL oil was dissolved in 100 μL of DCM:MeOH (93:7
v/v). The SPE column was wetted with the first eluent before the dissolved
oil sample was gently applied to the top of the column material. Then,
the column was placed on top of the SPE vacuum manifold by Supelco
Visiprep, the extraction vacuum was kept on 20 mHg, and the flow rate
through the column was adjusted to 0.3 cm3/min. Three different
eluents were used in an increasing polarity order as given in Table 3. The different fractions
were collected in sample vials, concentrated, and then weighted. Fractions
2 and 3 were prepared for GC–MS analysis.

Table 3 Eluents Used in Solid Phase Extraction

hexane:dichloromethane	90:10	20

methanol:dichloromethane	70:30	20	
4.5.4 Silylation
The collected fractions
using eluent 3 (DCM:MeOH) from solid phase extraction were silylated
by measuring 10 mg of the sample into a vial, adding 3 mL of the internal
standard solution (0.01 mg/mL hexadecane in ethyl acetate:tetrahydrofuran
(90:10 v/v)), thus giving a sample concentration of 3.33 mg/mL. A
volume of 1 mL of the prepared sample solution was transferred to
a GC vial, and 150 μL of pyridine and 150 μL of BSTFA
were added. The GC vial was capped and heated to 70 °C for 30
min before cooling to room temperature. To a new GC vial, a volume
of 0.7 mL of the silylated sample was transferred and diluted with
0.7 mL of pentane. The GC vial was capped and cooled to 5 °C
overnight and filtered through a 0.5 μL syringe filter before
analyzing by GC–MS.

4.5.5 Gas Chromatography–Mass
Spectroscopy
(for Silylated Samples)
The prepared samples above were analyzed
using an Agilent Technologies 7890A GC-system with an autosampler,
coupled with an Agilent 5977A MSD. The injection was run in the splitless
mode at 280 °C (injector temperature) on a 30 m HP-5ms column
with 250 μm i.d. and thickness of 0.25 μm from Agilent
Technologies. The following GC–MS instrumental conditions were
applied:

Start temperature: 40 °C (held for 5 min), heating
rate 1: 6 °C min–1 to 73 °C (held for
5 min), heating rate 2: 6 °C min–1 to 280 °C,
and heating rate 3: 40 °C min–1 to 300 °C
(held for 5 min).

The GC–MS interphase valve delay was
set to 11 min, and
the MS detector was operated in the positive mode at 70 eV with an
ion-source temperature of 230 °C. Compounds were identified using
Enhanced MSD Chemstation software F.01.00.1903 and the NIST 2.0 library.
