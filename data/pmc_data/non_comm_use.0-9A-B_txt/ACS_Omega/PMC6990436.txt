Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a popular
polymer widely used in smart hydrogel synthesis due to its thermo-responsive
behavior in aqueous medium. Aqueous PNIPAM hydrogels can reversibly
swell and collapse below and above their lower critical solution temperature
(LCST), respectively. The present work used molecular dynamics simulations
to explore the behavior of water molecules surrounding the side chains
of a NIPAM pentamer in response to temperature changes (273–353
K range) near its experimental LCST (305 K). Results suggest a strong
inverse correlation of temperature with water density and hydrophobic
hydration character of the first coordination shell around the isopropyl
groups. Integrity of the first and second coordination shells is further
characterized by polygon ring analysis. Predominant occurrence of
pentagons suggests clathrate-like behavior of both shells at lower
temperatures. This predominance is eventually overtaken by 4-membered
rings as temperature is increased beyond 303 and 293 K for the first
and second coordination shells, respectively, losing their clathrate-like
property. It is surmised that this temperature-dependent stability
of the coordination shells is one of the important factors that controls
the reversible swell-collapse mechanism of PNIPAM hydrogels.

1 Introduction
Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based hydrogel (PNIPAM)
is one of the most popular classes of hydrogels and has been used
in various material fabrications because of its thermo-responsive
property.1 Hydrogels of this class exhibit
large volume phase transition at a specific temperature called the
lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This property of PNIPAM
hydrogels has been exploited in several applications such as in catalytic
activity control,2 drug delivery and monitoring,3 novel compound synthesis,4,5 heavy
metal sensing,6,7 and tissue engineering.8 At temperatures below the LCST, PNIPAM hydrogel
swells to its maximum volume in aqueous solutions brought upon by
the absorption of a relatively huge amount of water molecules. This
stable swollen state collapses when the temperature is raised above
its LCST. Upon collapse, the gel volume is observed to decrease dramatically
as most of the absorbed water is removed from the gel’s interior.
This phenomenon has been initially studied in an earlier work as the
radius of gyration and hydrodynamic radius of the swollen PNIPAM hydrogel
abruptly drop as the temperature increases past the LCST at 305 K.9

The thermo-responsive behavior of PNIPAM
is not exclusive to cross-linked
hydrogels. It was previously found that even single chain PNIPAM oligomers
exhibit the same behavior at about the same temperature,10 signifying the independence of LCST on the degree
of cross-linking of PNIPAM hydrogels. This provides a convenient way
to study the LCST phenomenon using linear PNIPAM oligomers.

The role of water in the thermo-responsive behavior of PNIPAM is
believed to be an integral part in understanding LCST. Interestingly,
among popular pure solvent systems, only water exhibits LCST with
PNIPAM.11 Thus a great interest is drawn
towards the hydration behavior of water molecules in aqueous NIPAM
pentamer.

Several theories attempting to explain the LCST phenomenon
in PNIPAM
hydrogels have been established.12 Most
of these consider the hydrophobic interaction of the isopropyl group
and the surrounding water molecules. In this study, this hydrophobic
interaction is affirmed and the effect of temperature is also determined.
Considering that the isopropyl group is directly bonded to the hydrophilic
amide group in the side chains, results obtained in the present work
is a consequence of the hydrophobic–hydrophilic coupling in
the PNIPAM side chain.

Hydration of nonpolar groups in solutes
is claimed to promote the
formation of clathrate-like structures in water.13 These structures are responsible for the favorable hydration
of these nonpolar groups. Consequently, their stability becomes an
important factor in keeping a favorable interaction between these
groups and water. For PNIPAM hydrogels, the interaction of water with
the isopropyl groups may provide insights on their thermo-responsive
behavior.

In this work, we have used molecular dynamics to explore
the temperature-dependent
behavior of water molecules around the side groups of a NIPAM pentamer.
We have studied the hydrogen bonding network of water around the isopropyl
groups to probe clathrate-like behavior.

In one of the recent
studies on PNIPAM oligomers, the effect of
the polymer chain length has been studied in response to temperatures
below and above the LCST.14 It was found
that changes in the local density of water near the polymer significantly
varies with chain length. Specifically, the 30-mer PNIPAM exhibits
more pronounced changes in water density compared to 3-, 5-, and 10-mer
oligomers. However, we have noted that one of the effects of using
longer chain oligomers is the increase in the intramolecular interactions
at temperatures higher than the LCST due to folding. This decreases
the effective surface area of the polymer–water interface resulting
to a decrease in the local water density. In the present study, we
focused solely on the structural dynamics of water molecules near
the PNIPAM–water interface. To amplify the observed behavior
of water, the interface is maximized by using a short chain oligomer
of PNIPAM and applying consistent conformational bias towards the
coil state at all temperatures around the LCST.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Water Density around the
NIPAM Pentamer Side
Chains
Water densities surrounding the side chains of NIPAM
pentamer show possible first and second coordination shells around
the isopropyl groups, denoted by characteristic water oxygen atom
peaks at 0.5 and 0.75 nm in its g(r) plot with respect to the isopropyl carbon atom (Figure 1a). The peaks for the water
hydrogen atoms appear at almost the same radial distances, implying
that a significant number of O–H vectors of water molecules
are oriented along respective coordination shells. This O–H
vector orientation signifies the hydrophobic interaction between water
and the isopropyl groups.

Figure 1 Density profiles of water around the NIPAM pentamer
side chains.
(a–c) are g(r) plots of oxygen
and hydrogen atoms of water with respect to the isopropyl carbon,
amide nitrogen, and amide oxygen of the pentamer side chains at 273
K. Directly below these plots are their corresponding temperature
dependence of water oxygen density [plots (d–f)].

Peaks found at the g(r)
plot
of water molecules around the amide nitrogen atoms (Figure 1b) show relatively weak intensities
at 0.3 and 0.35 nm for the water oxygen and hydrogen atoms, respectively.
This arrangement of the first peaks is consistent with the hydrogen
bond donor capability of the N–H bond of the amide group, where
the oxygen of water is expected to be closer to the nitrogen than
the water hydrogen atoms. However, the weak intensities denote that
this N–H···O–H hydrogen bond between
the amide N–H and water oxygen does not persist over time and
may be considered weak and less stable.

The g(r) plot for water with
respect to the amide oxygen atoms (Figure 1c) also shows consistent hydrogen bond acceptor
tendency. The nearest peaks for the g(r) of water oxygen and hydrogen atoms are found at around 0.3 and
0.2 nm with respect to the amide oxygen atoms of the NIPAM pentamer,
respectively. This suggests that the carbonyl oxygen of the amide
group forms C=O···H–O hydrogen bond with
water. The 0.1 nm difference in distance between the first peaks implies
that the water O–H vectors are oriented directly towards the
amide oxygen. The sharp peaks strongly suggest that the C=O···H–O
hydrogen bond is strong and stable.

Water oxygen g(r) peaks are found
at the same radial distances at different temperatures within the
273–353 K range as shown in Figure 1d–f. However, a decreasing trend in
the intensities with increasing temperature is observed. This trend
implies that increasing the temperature decreases the ordering of
the coordination shells around the isopropyl groups as well as the
destabilization of the hydrogen bonds formed between water and the
amide groups.

2.2 Isopropyl–Water
Interface
The orientation of water molecules in the coordination
shells around
the isopropyl groups is determined by measuring the angle formed between
the O–H bond vectors of water molecules and the O···C
vector formed by the water oxygen atom and the isopropyl carbon atom
(see Supporting Information). Figure 2a shows that only
the interfacial water (0.3–0.6 nm) molecules exhibit preferred
orientation. Notable peaks are found at cos(θ) values −0.925
and 0.400, corresponding to 157.7 and 66.4° respectively. The
latter is consistent with the g(r) findings in Figure 1a where, compared to oxygen, the peak for the hydrogen atoms is slightly
closer to the isopropyl carbon. The former, on the other hand, implies
that the interfacial water molecules have O–H bonds that are
oriented away from the surface of the isopropyl groups. These orientations
conform with an earlier work on the hydration of hydrophobic surfaces.15

Figure 2 Distribution of the angular parameter θ of O–H
vectors
of water around isopropyl groups. (a) The normalized distributions
of cos(θ) for water molecules at each radial distance interval;
(b) the effect of temperature on the distribution at the interface
(0.3–0.6 nm).

Peak heights in the angular
parameter distribution provide quantitative
comparison on the extent of the hydrophobic character of hydration.
Temperature dependence of the degree of hydrophobic hydration is observed
from the overlay of 0.3–0.6 nm cos(θ) distributions at
different temperatures (Figure 2b). Decreasing trend of the peak heights with increasing temperature
implies a decrease in the hydrophobic character of the first coordination
shell of the isopropyl groups of the NIPAM pentamer side chains.

2.3 Polygon Distribution in the Water Network
Determination of hydration behavior using angular order parameter
is shown to be limited only at the interface of isopropyl and water.
Here we used polygon distribution analysis to characterize both the
first and second coordination shells of the isopropyl groups of NIPAM
pentamer. Analysis of the hydrogen bonding network of water molecules
surrounding the isopropyl groups (Figure 3) shows predominance of non-short-circuited
polygon rings with sizes n = {4, 5, 6}. Initially
at 273 K, the number of occurrences for pentagons are higher than
both the quadrilaterals and hexagons (Figure 4). As previously mentioned, this distribution
of polygon rings is consistent with the clathrate-like behavior of
water surrounding large hydrophobic surfaces.16

Figure 3 Representative
configurational snapshot of the hydrogen bonding
network of water forming polygon rings near the NIPAM pentamer within
0.6 nm from isopropyl carbon atoms. Water molecules (red and white
lines) form hydrogen bonds (green broken lines) within the water HB
network near the NIPAM pentamer (ball and stick structure).

Figure 4 Polygon distribution profile of the water network around
the isopropyl
group of NIPAM pentamer within 273–353 K range. Polygon ring
counting from 20,000 frames (10 ns trajectory) showed polygon sizes
with n = {4, 5, 6} the most dominant. Decreasing
trend in the total number of occurrences of each polygon size is observed
for both the first (a) and second (b) coordination shells of the isopropyl
groups.

Increasing the temperature decreases
the total number of occurrences
of all three polygon rings in the first and second coordination shells
(Figure 4a,b, respectively).
However, pentagons apparently decrease at a higher rate than the quadrilaterals
as temperature is increased. As a result, the number of pentagons
start to dip lower than the quadrilaterals at 303 and 293 K for the
first and second coordination shells, respectively. This implies that
both coordination shells lose their clathrate-like behavior at these
temperatures. Furthermore, the second coordination shell loses this
property at a lower temperature than the first coordination shell.
This appears as if the shells are sequentially destabilized, where
the outer shell is peeled off first followed by the inner shell. Incidentally,
the temperature limit of the clathrate-like behavior of the first
coordination shell is close to the experimentally determined LCST
of PNIPAM hydrogels at 305 K, showing a good correlation with its
thermo-responsive behavior. Considering that this clathrate-like behavior
is responsible for the stable hydration of hydrophobic surfaces, it
is possible that losing this property may cause unstable hydration
of the PNIPAM side chains ultimately leading to the collapse of the
hydrogel.

3 Conclusions
PNIPAM
hydrogels have been one of the most exploited material when
it comes to smart hydrogels due to their thermo-responsive property.
In this study, we have explored the behavior of water molecules interacting
with NIPAM pentamer side chains in an attempt to discover possible
insights on the LCST phenomenon. Molecular dynamics simulations were
performed for an aqueous NIPAM pentamer at different temperatures
around the experimental LCST. Analyses show the presence of two coordination
shells surrounding the isopropyl groups, where the densities of these
shells decrease with increasing temperature. Orientation of water
molecules in the first coordination shell signified consistency with
the hydration of hydrophobic surfaces, also exhibiting a decrease
in the hydrophobic character of the coordination shell as temperature
is increased. Polygon distribution analyses further characterized
the coordination shells and were shown to possess a clathrate-like
behavior at lower temperatures, but subsequently losing it upon breaching
a temperature threshold. This clathrate-like behavior may be responsible
for the stability of the hydrophobic surface of the isopropyl group
at temperatures below the LCST. It is surmised that the LCST is a
threshold at which the clathrate-like behavior of the coordination
shells can persist before the PNIPAM hydrogel collapses on itself.
This supports the previous results done by Sumi and Koga17 where solvent-induced interactions play a dominant
role in the stability of the unfolded state of chignolin, a protein
having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions in its native
folded state.18 The findings presented
in this work can provide insights on both the understanding of LCST
in PNIPAM hydrogels as well as the intricacies of solvent behavior
in studying stimuli-responsive properties of smart polymer hydrogels.

4 Methods
4.1 Computational Details
In this study,
a model of NIPAM pentamer was prepared using the atom type format
provided by the OPLSAA forcefield.19 It
was initially solvated with 2161 TIP4P water molecules in a 4.0 ×
4.0 × 4.0 nm3 cubic box.

MD simulations were
performed using GROMACS v5.0.6.20 Leapfrog
algorithm21 for integrating Newton’s
laws of motions was used in all simulations. Potentials arising from
bonded and nonbonded interactions were calculated using OPLSAA forcefield.19 All bonding interactions were constrained using
the LINCS22 algorithm. Cut-off scheme was
set to Verlet.23 Short range Coulombic
and van der Waals interactions were cut off at 1.1 nm. A conformational
bias towards the coil state was applied on the pentamer by adding
non-bonded weak harmonic potentials between adjacent monomer side
chains. This increases the interfacial surface area between the monomer
side chains and water.

Periodic boundary conditions were applied
in the three Cartesian
coordinate axes. Long range interactions were treated using the particle
mesh Ewald method.24 Temperature and pressure
coupling were performed by applying velocity rescaling25 and Parrinello–Rahman26 methods, respectively. Timestep was set at 1 fs and configurations
were recorded every 0.5 ps. The simulation box was pre-equilibrated
at 1 bar and 500 K for 10 ns. This temperature is significantly higher
than the experimental PNIPAM LCST and was selected to set an initial
coil conformation of the pentamer as the starting configuration. Velocity
generation was turned off after retrieval of coordinates of the last
snapshot of the pre-equilibration. This snapshot was used as the starting
configuration for 50 ns equilibration at nine temperatures (273, 283,
293, 303, 313, 323, 333, 343 and 353 K) under isothermal isobaric
(NPT) conditions. Trajectory sampling for analysis
was done for the last 10 ns of each of the 50 ns simulations.

4.2 Methods of Analysis
4.2.1 Radial Distribution Analysis
Interaction
of water molecules with the NIPAM pentamer side chains were characterized
by measuring radial distribution functions,27g(r), of the oxygen and hydrogen
atoms of water molecules with respect to atoms of interest which includes
the amide nitrogen, amide oxygen, and isopropyl carbon atoms.

4.2.2 Angular Order Parameter
Angles
formed between the water O–H vectors with respect to the vector
connecting the water oxygen atom to the isopropyl carbon atoms are
obtained. From here, we monitored distributions of these angles to
measure the degree of hydrophobic hydration as implemented in a previous
work28 where these O–H vectors tend
to orient tangentially to the solute surface along the interface while
the others are pointed away from the solute (see Supporting Information).

4.2.3 Polygon
Analysis of the Hydrogen Bond Network
Structures formed by
water molecules in the hydrogen bond network
may be used to probe hydration behavior. One of these structures are
polygon rings formed by water molecules connected through hydrogen
bonding. We have used the hydrogen bonding parameters from a theoretical
study on hydrogen bond dynamics in water.29 In an earlier work,16 the number of rings
formed was used to describe both hydrophobic and hydrophilic type
of hydration. The distinction was made between these two types of
hydration based on the predominance of pentagons in its network. Pentagons
are indicative of a clathrate-like behavior,16 characteristic of a favorable hydrophobic hydration. On the other
hand, hydrophilic hydration is observed when the number of pentagon
occurrences becomes less than the quadrilaterals. This distinction
serves as a basis in determining clathrate-like behavior of water
in the coordination shells.

The hydration behavior of the neighboring
water molecules of the NIPAM pentamer is probed by counting occurrences
of non-short-circuited rings30 within hydration
shells surrounding the isopropyl groups. To test for clathrate-like
behavior, a ring is only counted if the difference between radial
distances from the isopropyl carbon atoms of the nearest and farthest
water oxygen atom is less than 0.2 nm. This is to ensure that the
faces of the rings counted are oriented towards the isopropyl group.
The radial distances of the rings are measured by calculating the
distance of the geometric center of each ring with respect to the
nearest isopropyl carbon atom of the NIPAM pentamer.
