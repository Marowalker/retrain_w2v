This
is the first study on the impact of ice crystals on glass
transition and mechanical behavior of soft cross-linked elastomers.
A hydrophilic elastomer such as epichlorohydrin–ethylene oxide–allyl
glycidyl ether can absorb about ∼40 wt % of water. The water-swollen
cross-linked network exhibits elastic properties with more than 1500%
stretchability at room temperature. Coincidently, the phase transition
of water into solid ice crystals inside of the composites allows the
reinforcement of the soft elastomer mechanically at lower temperatures.
Young’s modulus of the composites measured at −20 °C
remarkably increased from 1.45 to 3.14 MPa, whereas at +20 °C,
the effect was opposite and the Young’s modulus decreased from
0.6 to 0.03 MPa after 20 days of water treatment. It was found that
a part of the absorbed water, ∼74% of the total absorbed water,
is freezable and occupies nearly 26 vol % of the composites. Simultaneously,
these solid ice crystals are found to be acting as a reinforcing filler
at lower temperatures. The size of these ice crystals is distributed
in a relatively narrow range of 400–600 nm. The storage modulus
(E′) of the ice crystal-filled composites
increased from 3 to 13 MPa at −20 °C. The glass transition
temperature (−37 °C) of the soft cross-linked elastomer
was not altered by the absorption of water. However, a special transition
(melting of ice) occurred at temperatures close to 0 °C as observed
in the dynamic mechanical analysis of the water-swollen elastomers.
The direct polymer/filler (ice crystals) interaction was demonstrated
by strain sweep experiments and investigated using Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy. This type of cross-linked rubber could be integrated
into a smart rubber application such as in adaptable mechanics, where
the stiffness of the rubber can be altered as a function of temperature
without affecting the mechanical stretchability either below or above
0 °C (above the glass temperature region) of the rubber.

Introduction
Fillers are small, often nanoscaled, solid
particles that are incorporated
into soft elastomers mainly to increase the mechanical and other engineering
properties such as modulus, hardness, tensile strength, abrasion,
tear, fatigue, and crack resistance, leading to better performance
and a longer lifetime of the final rubber product. More specifically,
carbon black and precipitated silica are the main reinforcing fillers1 used in rubber for different technological applications,
especially in the tire industry. Reinforcement of elastomer composites
by fillers is primarily influenced by the particle size, aspect ratio,
surface area, and structure of the fillers. In short, it can be said
that reinforcement of the elastomers depends on the ability of the
polymer chains to transfer the load to the filler matrix. The mechanism
of reinforcement has been debated for a long period of time, and several
theories have been proposed.2

Hydrophilic
polymers are increasingly used in the field of sensors
(humidity and glucose), membranes, coatings (antifouling and antifogging),
caulking, body implants, adsorbents, mechanical actuators, and various
smart materials.3,4 In general, hydrophilic polymers
swell in water to a certain extent (increase in size and shape). The
absorbed water may lead to major changes in the mechanical and chemical
properties, which depend on the type of polymer, the degree of swelling,
and so forth. Blasi et al.5 report that
a small amount of water absorbed by poly-(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) under high relative humidity acts as a plasticizer,
lowering the glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer proportional to the amount of water in the matrix.
Ito et al.6 found that epoxy resins showed
a significant decrease in elastic modulus proportional to the degree
of water sorption. Water absorbed in a hydrophilic polymer presents
thermodynamic properties slightly different from those of water in
the bulk liquid phase.7 Tanaka et al.8 classify the hydrated water in a polymer into
three types: nonfreezable bound water, freezable
bound water (also called intermediate water), and free water. Initially, the water molecules
get isolated, are homogenously distributed throughout the polymer,
and have greater restricted mobility because they strongly interact
with the polar groups in the polymer chain, called nonfreezable
bound water. After a certain threshold of bound water is
reached, the additional water molecules interact weakly with the hydrophilic
groups of the polymer and are termed freezable bound water. Furthermore, when the amount of absorbed water increases, it remains
isolated and is termed free water. Only the free
water and freezable bound water form ice crystals when cooled down.
They differ in the melting point: the crystals of free water melt
at 0 °C, whereas the ice crystals of freezable bound water melt
at temperatures lower than 0 °C.9 Bjerrum10 states that ice crystals can be present in two
closely related crystal structures: hexagonal and cubic ice crystals.
A hexagonal crystal structure is obtained by freezing the water slowly,
whereas the cubic structure is normally formed by depositing vapor
at low temperatures. The hexagonal crystal structure is the common
form of ice crystals, owing to its tetrahedral molecular geometry.
Kumai11 reports that the ice crystal structure
depends on the temperature of substrates. The hexagonal form of ice
crystals is formed below −100 °C; between −100
and −130 °C, both the hexagonal and the cubic forms of
ice can be found; and above −130 °C, only cubic ice crystals
were detected.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of imbibed
water on the
mechanical and dynamic mechanical behaviors of soft cross-linked elastomer
composites at low temperatures, particularly when the water molecules
remain in a nanoconfined and frozen state. A cross-linked hydrophilic
polymer, epichlorohydrin–ethylene oxide–allyl glycidyl
ether (GECO), was used as an elastomeric matrix. The GECO elastomer
absorbs water, which can be transformed into ice crystals after cooling
down to lower temperatures. We performed detailed studies to understand
the reinforcing ability of the frozen ice in the soft rubber matrix.
Studies on the in situ formation of ice crystals, their nanoconfinement
structures, and their direct interaction with GECO are the main issues
discussed in this article. Additionally, this paper deals with the
effect of ice crystals on the dynamic mechanical and quasistatic mechanical
behaviors of the soft elastomer.

Results and Discussion
Water absorption characteristics of the GECO composites are shown
in Figure 1a. GECO
composites absorb water of about ∼40% of the weight of the
dry sample and reach 90% of their swelling capacity in 4–5
days. GECO, being a polymer with oxygen atoms in the polymer backbone,
is very hydrophilic, and in its cross-linked state, it can absorb
a considerable amount of water. A certain amount of this absorbed
water can be frozen into ice crystals, when the matrix material is
cooled down at temperatures below 0 °C. The amount of freezable
and nonfreezable water can be calculated using the differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) with the help of endothermic ice-melting profile
of the swollen cross-linked elastomer.12 The heating curves of the dry elastomers and 2-, 7-, and 20-day
water-swollen elastomers are shown in Figure 1b. The broad endothermic peak is due to the
convergence of the melting of free water and freezable bound water.13

and (d) derivative weight of the composite as a function of temperature
during the thermogravimetric analysis.

So, we can assume that the total water content (Wt) is the sum of nonfreezable
water content (Wnf) and freezable water content (Wf)
. The freezable water content (Wf) subsumes
here the freezable water fractions of free and freezable bound water
in the polymer. 1  

Assuming equal melting enthalpies for the different types
of water
(free and freezable bound water), the amount of freezable water can
be obtained from the following equation 2  where Wd is the
weight of the dry sample, Ws is the weight
of the swollen elastomer, ΔHs is
the enthalpy of the swollen elastomer, and ΔH is the enthalpy of bulk water, which can be taken as ∼330
J/g [the melting enthalpies of different ice crystals are not considered
in this calculation, and so, the maximum error in the calculated amount
of freezable water/ice crystals was expected to be less than 5%9 (lowest for tetragonal ice crystals, 312 J/g,
and highest for hexagonal ice crystals, 334 J/g)].

The swelling
ratio Q can be written as 3  Similarly, the amount of nonfreezable
water
can be obtained using 4  where 5  The ice-melting
enthalpies (ΔHS) were obtained by
integration of the peak
areas of the DSC curves (Figure 1b) of water-swollen GECO composites. The weight percentage
(wt %) of the freezable water and the volume percentage (vol %) of
the ice crystals formed in the GECO composite are shown in Table 1. The vol % of the
ice crystals with respect to the total volume of the composite was
calculated using 6  From Table 1, it can be seen that with an increase in
the absorbed
water inside of the rubber, the vol % of the ice crystals steadily
increases, indicating more freezable water molecules with a higher
amount of absorbed water. A maximum of ∼26 vol % of ice crystals
was obtained, and it was also found that 70–80% of the absorbed
water molecules is available for the formation of ice crystals.

From the thermogravimetric analysis,
it was found that the 20-day
water-swollen elastomers undergo a two-stage degradation process (Figure 1c). The first degradation
is due to the evaporation of water and low-molecular-weight cross-linking
ingredients. The second stage appears due to the polymer degradation.
At 180 °C, the first degradation process is completed with a
degradation loss of 26 wt %. This is in accordance with the swelling
studies, where an amount of absorbed water of 28 wt % can also be
found (Table 1). It
can be noted from the derivative plot (Figure 1d) that the maximum degradation peak of the
polymer chain itself is shifted from 326 to 331 °C, indicating
a more stable compound after treatment with water.

Cryo-transmission
electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) is used for imaging
frozen-hydrated specimens at cryogenic temperatures.14 In this work, the solid ice crystals at freezing temperatures
in swollen GECO composites were visualized using cryo-TEM. The cryo-TEM
images of 20-day water-swollen GECO composites are shown in Figure 2. Hereby, it can
be observed roughly that spherical- to oval-shaped ice crystals are
uniformly distributed in the matrix. The black regions are ice crystals
condensed from air humidity at the surface of the specimen. Energy-filtered
transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) technique was additionally
used to deduce the chemical composition of the imaged composite. Elemental
maps of carbon and oxygen from these EFTEM measurements are shown
in Figure 2b. The green
and red areas indicate the presence of carbon in the polymer and the
presence of oxygen in solid ice (H2O), respectively. The
presence of oxygen in the GECO polymer is also identified, as red
dots in the green areas. The oxygen-enriched domains (red) confirm
the formation of solid ice crystals. The particle size of these ice
crystals remains in the range of submicron level (400–600 nm),
which may act as reinforcing filler particles in swollen GECO composites
at low temperatures. Water-swollen GECO composites were in situ freeze-dried
during cryo-TEM imaging (see Figure 2c). During the freeze-drying process, ice crystals
inside of the specimen sublimated and left small holes (pores) in
the composites. These pores in the composites confirm the presence
of ice crystals inside of the composite before freeze-drying. Selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of water-swollen GECO composites
yielded a ring and spot pattern, matching those expected for the polycrystalline
ice crystals (Figure 2d). SAED pattern can be indexed as (002), (101), (102), (103), and
(201) planes, which confirm the hexagonal crystal structure of ice,
in accordance with ref (11) (Table in Figure 2).

Figure 2 (a) Formation of ice crystals can be seen in cryo-TEM image of
water-swollen GECO composites, (b) carbon and oxygen maps overlaid
on (a), (c) pores and voids produced by freeze-drying in situ in cryo-TEM,
and (d) SAED image of GECO–ice crystal composites. The indexed
rings correspond to the crystalline lattice of hexagonal ice crystals
in accordance with the literature (see inserted Table).

The dynamic mechanical behavior of water-filled cross-linked GECO
composites was also studied. The loss factor tan δ as a function
of temperature is shown in Figure 3a. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the elastomer was found to be at −37 °C
under the experimental dynamic conditions at 10 Hz frequency. Tg is found to be unaltered with different water
contents of the elastomer (elastomers swollen for different days).
The unaltered glass transition temperature of elastomers swollen for
different days confirms the formation of ice crystals and the absence
of plasticizing effect. The interaction of ice crystals with the polymer
chains can be seen from reduction in the tan δ peak height.
A strong dependency on the tan δ peak height was noticed with
a higher amount of water. Simultaneously with an increase in the water
content, the storage modulus increases in the temperature range of
−37 to 0 °C (Figure 3b). The storage moduli at −20 °C of 2-,
7-, and 20-day-swollen GECO composites are about 40% (5 MPa), 123%
(8 MPa), and 271% (13 MPa) higher than those of the pure GECO composites
without water (3 MPa). The solid ice is expected to interact with
polymer chains by hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups of
the ice crystals and the oxygen in the polymer chains. Owing to a
direct interaction of the rubber and the solid ice, the ice crystals
behave as a reinforcing filler, which might be the primary reason
for the enhanced storage modulus. It should be mentioned here that
the composite with less water content (∼5 wt % of the water
content), did not show any improvement of in the storage modulus (not
shown here) because of an insufficient quantity of free water molecules,
which cannot be transformed into ice crystals.

tan δ, (b) storage modulus E′ as a function
of temperature of GECO composites

experiment with 7-day water-swollen elastomers.

At 0 °C, a crossover point in the storage modulus can
be observed
(Figure 3b); the reinforcing
behavior of the ice crystals is now replaced by a plasticizing effect
of the water inside of the rubber. The storage moduli at +20 °C
of 2-, 7-, and 20-day water-swollen GECO composites are about 41%
(1 MPa), 45% (0.94 MPa), and 63% (0.62 MPa) lower than those of the
pure GECO composites without water (1.7 MPa).

To understand
this reversible transformation of water into ice
crystals, a cyclic temperature sweep was carried out with 7-day water-swollen
elastomers (Figure 3d). In the first heating step, the storage modulus of the compound
continuously decreases, until it reaches a plateau value around 0
°C. In the cooling cycle, this rubbery plateau can be observed
up to −14 °C, and then the storage modulus increases.

Similar shifts in temperature (difference in the melting and freezing
temperatures of water has been reported in DSC) can be seen elsewhere.15 Most probably, the observed hysteresis is due
to the poor thermal conductivity of the rubber and a slow ice crystal
formation of the absorbed water. In the second heating step, the curve
follows that of the first heating cycle, which indicates a reversible
temperature-dependent mechanical performance of the rubber sample.

The impact of pressure-induced melting during DMA experiments (static
and dynamic strains applied repetitively) has been analyzed, considering
the phase diagram of water dP/dT ≈ −13.5 MPa/K near 0 °C and 1 atm (∼0.1
MPa). Pressure changes can be roughly estimated with changes in the
modulus in the corresponding region of the temperature change. According
to Figure 3c, roughly
Δp ≈ ΔE′
≈ 1 MPa (or even smaller) has been obtained in a sensitive
temperature range between −20 and 0 °C, resulting in an
expected temperature change |ΔT| ≈ 0.07
K or even smaller.16,17 The temperature changes were
found to be very less, and so, such an effect (pressure-induced melting)
has been neglected in this work.

To summarize the detailed observation
in Figure 3, the glass
transition temperature of rubber
was found to be −37 °C (10 Hz DMA measurement); in the
temperature range from −37 to 0 °C, the ice crystals formed
reinforced the rubber; above 0 °C, the mechanical properties
are drastically changed toward a soft rubber, where the water content
is acting as a softening agent.

Stress–strain studies
were carried out at −20 °C
and at room temperature (RT) (+20 °C); the results are shown
in Figure 4a. For water-swollen
elastomers, the sample was kept at −20 °C for 30 min (20-day
water-swollen) before stress–strain measurements. The water-swollen
elastomers show higher mechanical properties at −20 °C
than the dry GECO sample. The stress at 100% strain (100% modulus,
M100) values increases from 0.55 to 0.71 MPa compared with the dry
sample. However, at RT (20 °C), the water-containing composites
show poor mechanical properties, and the M100 value drops from 0.32
to 0.11 MPa. However, still all composites show more than 1500% stretchability.
This confirms the plasticizing effect of water on the hydrophilic
matrix (GECO). On the other hand, a stronger mechanical performance
of the water-swollen elastomer at −20 °C indicates the
reinforcing action of solid ice crystals and their direct interaction
with the polymer chains by hydrogen bonding. The volume fraction of
the ice crystals acting as filler particles was calculated using the
initial modulus derived from the stress–strain experiment evaluated
at −20 °C with the help of hydrodynamic reinforcement
effect.

elastomers. The experiment was performed at −20 and +20 °C.
(b) MR plot of the dry and 20-day water-swollen GECO composites.

The hydrodynamic reinforcement
factor can be estimated by the Chen
and Acrivos equation for hard spherical particles18,19 7  

Here, E is
the initial modulus of water-swollen
elastomers, E0 is the initial modulus
of the dry sample, and ϕ is the volume fraction of the ice crystals
formed. The initial modulus of the dry sample was 1.45 MPa, and the
value for 20-day water-swollen elastomers was 3.14 MPa. The volume
fraction of ice crystals present inside of the cross-linked GECO composites
was found to be 29 vol %, which is well consistent with the results
of the DSC study (∼26 vol %).

The filler reinforcement
and filler/polymer affinity can be analyzed
from the stress–strain behavior illustrated by a phenomenological
expression proposed by Mooney and Rivlin20−22 8  where σ is the applied stress, λ
is the extension ratio, and C1 and C2 are the Mooney–Rivlin (MR) constants.
The plot obtained from the reduced stress (σ/λ –
λ–2) against 1/λ and the analysis of
linear regimes in the plot provided the values of C1 (intercept) and C2 (slope).
The MR plots for dry and water-swollen elastomers are shown in Figure 4b. Furthermore, cross-link
density (ν) can be calculated from C1 using the expression 2C1= νkT, where ν is the cross-link density, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. A slight decrease in the cross-link density of the water-swollen
elastomer at 20 °C and a certain degree of increased value at
−20 °C of the composite-containing ice crystals can be
observed (Table 2).
The increase in the cross-link density indicates a larger number of
rubber chains forming a network structure with ice crystals (acting
as cross-linking points) through hydrogen bonding.

To understand
how the reinforcing character of the ice crystals
is developed during the transformation of water to ice, the storage
modulus of the dry sample and of the water-swollen elastomer was measured
as a function of time with a constant static and dynamic load at −20
°C and is shown in Figure 5a. The modulus of the dry rubber is almost unaltered with
time. However, the increase in the storage modulus is remarkable when
the composite was swollen with water (20 days). This increase in the
storage modulus can be used to visualize the formation of ice crystals
with time.

Figure 5 (a) Time sweep of dry and 20-day water-swollen elastomers (dynamic
strain—1%; static strain—0.2% at −20 °C).
(b) Storage modulus E′ as a function of dynamic
strain. Data for high strains are extrapolated for hydrodynamic reinforcement
from the unfilled GECO. Solid dots and lines represent experimental
values and fitted curves, respectively.

The strain sweep analysis was carried out at −20 °C
to evaluate the dependence of storage modulus on dynamic strain and
is shown in Figure 5b. In general, the storage modulus of the unfilled composites was
expected to be independent of dynamic strain, whereas the filled composites
exhibited a nonlinear dependence of storage modulus on dynamic strain,
which can be attributed to the destruction of the filler–filler
network, the so-called Payne effect.23 Hereby,
it was found that the higher the volume fraction of ice crystals formed
inside of the rubber, the stronger the Payne effect. On the other
hand, it is important to note that this effect is negligible for the
dry GECO sample. This confirms the filler networking of ice crystals
inside of the water-swollen GECO composite. The strain dependencies
of the water-swollen elastomers were analyzed by means of the phenomenological
model by Kraus,24 which is based on the
agglomeration–deagglomeration mechanism of the fillers 9  Hereby, E′(γ)
is the modulus of the composite at the strain γ, E′(γ) = E′∞ at very large strain; E′(γ) = E′0 at very low strain γ0; γc is the critical strain at which the magnitude
of E′0 – E′∞ becomes half; and m is
a constant (strain sensitivity of the mechanism of filler–filler
contact breakage), which depends on specific fractal dimensions of
the fractal agglomerate structures of the fillers. The parameter γc is largely dependent on the nature and type of the fillers
and polymers and the state of the dispersion of the filler in the
soft elastomer matrix. The values of γc and m are shown in Table 3. It can be found that γc is almost similar,
indicating the similar type of rubber–filler and filler–filler
interactions. However, the value of m decreases with
the increase in the water content of the rubber. There have been some
reports on the m value of typical carbon black-filled
rubber composites, and it is found that the value of m is independent of the type and nature of the carbon black and is
constant at ∼0.6.25 In our present
case, the value of m is not a constant, indicating
that the ice crystals formed at different levels of water content
might have different morphologies and crystal structures.

Figure 6a shows
the attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR)
spectra of dry and 20-day water-swollen GECO composites, measured
at RT. The spectroscopic distinction of composites before and after
water exposure is quite clear and obvious. The ATR-FTIR spectrum of
20-day water-swollen elastomers shows typical intensive broad bands
of both stretching and deformation vibrations of the water hydroxyl
group at 3415 and 1639 cm–1, respectively,26 indicating a high water concentration in 20-day
water-swollen GECO composites.

Figure 6 ATR-FTIR analysis/spectra of GECO composites:
(a) dry and 20-day
water-swollen elastomers and (b) ATR-FTIR spectra at room and elevated
temperatures: dry composite at RT, after 1 h treatment at 120 °C,
after cooling back to RT, and after 21 h at RT.

According to the chemical structure of GECO, one would expect
intermolecular
hydrogen bonding between ether groups and water molecules (Figure 6a), usually resulting
in a band shift of a corresponding bonded structure in an infrared
spectrum. Taking into account such a behavior, the ATR-FTIR spectrum
of the 20-day water-swollen elastomers (Figure 6a) should have a remarkable band shift of
the ether group (band of asymmetrical stretching vibration of the
ether group at 1088 cm–126 in the spectrum of the initial dry sample) to lower frequencies
after water penetration into GECO. However, only a weak shift of the
ether band has been noticed [4 cm–1 band movement
(to 1084 cm–1 after water exposure)], which is close
to the spectrum resolution and can hardly be used as a reliable sign
of ether–water interaction.

On the other hand, the functionalities
of the GECO polymer are
known to be quite polar in nature; therefore, a prominent hydrogen
bonding and the corresponding band movement would be highly expected.
Therefore, it is important to note that in the ATR-FTIR spectra in Figure 6a, the dry (nonswollen)
composites show medium to weak bands in characteristic spectroscopic
water regions as well (3415 and 1639 cm–1), which
indicates the presence of moisture in the dry GECO composites.
(To understand the moisture absorption behavior of the dry composites,
water absorption of dry composites at RT for 20 days was characterized
and was found to be 1.5%.)

To confirm the hydrogen-bonding interaction
between the ether groups
of GECO and water molecules, temperature-dependent ATR-FTIR spectroscopy
was performed. The initial dry specimen was heated up to 120 °C
and was cooled down back to RT (see Experimental
Section for details) to avoid the presence of moisture. The
particular ATR-FTIR spectra are presented in Figure 6b. As expected, after temperature treatment,
a remarkable band shift of the ether group (to higher frequencies,
8 cm–1) is observed, pointing out the interaction
of ether groups with moisture (absorbed due to the hydrophilic nature
of GECO). Cooling down the system back to RT, the reversibility of
band shift can be observed. After 21 h in air at RT, the ether band
moved back to lower frequencies (7 cm–1). The fact
is that the ether groups in the initial dry sample have already been
“busy” (bonded) with water molecules (moisture) absorbed
from air, which explains the weak movement of ether bands regardless
of the amount of water in the 20-day water-swollen elastomers.

Figure 7a describes
the possible hydrogen bonding between the polymer chains (ether group)
and the water molecules (hydrogen group) along with some free water
molecules. The proposed mechanism of water-swollen elastomers at different
temperatures is shown in Figure 7b: when the composite is cooled, the freezable water
molecules form ice crystals, which are already weakly-hydrogen-bonded
with polymer chains.

and polymer
chains, (b) schematic representation of the rubber–filler interaction,
and (c) molecular dynamics simulation of the polymer and some water
molecules (red—oxygen atom, gray—carbon atom, and white—hydrogen
atom).

To visualize the possible molecular
arrangement of the polymer
chains and water molecules, molecular dynamics simulations were performed
(ChemBio3D 14.0, Perkin-Elmer, MM2 optimization). A polymer molecule
with 7 polyoxyethylene repeating units was taken along with 15 water
molecules and simulated. Hereby, it was observed that the polymer
chain encloses a cluster of water molecules, which indicates a strong
hydrophilic character of the polymers (Figure 7c).

Conclusions
Hydrophilic, cross-linked
GECO elastomers can absorb water; at
low temperatures, part of the absorbed water can act as reinforcing
filler, when the water is frozen into ice crystals. A detailed mechanistic
study was carried out, and for the first time, the reinforcing nature
of ice crystals in soft elastomers was explored. Direct stress–strain
experiments and a sharp reduction in the tan δ peak heights
in DMA experiments very clearly indicate the reinforcing character
of solid ice crystals. Although a large amount of water can be absorbed
by the cross-linked rubber, only a part of these absorbed water molecules
(∼74% of the total water) can be converted into ice crystals.
The size of the ice crystals remains in the submicron range of 400–700
nm. Obviously, these submicron ice crystals formed inside of the rubber
are directly linked with polymer chains by weak hydrogen bonding with
oxygen atoms present in the GECO polymer. Thus, this direct polymer/filler
interaction leads to the reinforcement of the GECO composites. As
the solid–liquid phase transition of water takes place at higher
temperature range (∼0 °C), more specifically at the temperature
range higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer,
this kind of material can be used for mechanically adaptable applications,
where the material will behave in different ways (hard or soft) depending
on the temperature, while maintaining its elastic nature, that is,
more than 1500% stretchability with lower and higher stiffness. The
findings of this work can also inspire the design of smart adaptive
tires with situation-controlled, ice-grip, wet-skid, rolling-resistance,
and other dynamic properties.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
polyether-based GECO elastomer (Hydrin
T3108) was obtained from Zeon Chemicals. It is a terpolymer of epichlorohydrin
(CO), ethylene oxide (EO), and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE) (Figure 8). This terpolymer
contains 18–20% of chlorine (epichlorohydrin), 6–8%
of double bonds (AGE), and a high amount of EO. The density of GECO
is 1.28 g/cm3; its glass transition temperature is −51
°C (material supplier’s data, from DSC measurements).
The other compounding ingredients used were of rubber grade. This
terpolymer can be cross-linked by sulfur or peroxide because of the
presence of AGE in the terpolymer. The cross-linking chemicals sulfur,
zinc oxide (ZnO), stearic acid, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, and 3-methylthiazolidone-2-thione
used were of rubber grade.

Figure 8 Chemical structure of GECO.

Composite Preparation
The rubber mixture was compounded
in an internal mixer (Haake Rheomix, Thermo Electron GmbH, Karlsruhe,
Germany). At first, the GECO and the other ingredients are blended
at a fixed rotor speed of 60 rpm and at a temperature of 60 °C.
The total mixing time was 10 min. Finally, the compounded mass was
removed from the mixer and sheeted out in a two-roll mill (Polymix
110L, Servitech GmbH, Wustermark, Germany) at 70 °C. The optimum
cure time (t90) of the compound was measured
in a moving die rheometer at 160 °C and at a frequency of 1.67
Hz (SIS V-50, Scarabeus GmbH, Germany). The prepared rubber compounds
were cured under pressure at 160 °C using t90 value in a hot press.

Characterization
Water absorption studies were carried
out by immersing the sample in deionized water at RT. At first, the
weight of the dry sample was recorded (Wd). Then, the sample was immersed in water. The weight of the water-swollen
sample was measured (Ws) after removing
the surface water by blotting with a filter paper, at different times
until equilibrium swelling was reached. The water-swelling ratio was
calculated by (Ws – Wd)/Wd × 100. The temperature
sweep analysis was carried out using a rectangular specimen (10 ×
2 × 35 mm3) using a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer
(Gabo Qualimeter, Ahlden, Germany, Eplexor 150N) in tension mode.
The isochronal frequency used was 10 Hz, and the heating rate was
2 K/min with a dynamic load of 0.2% strain and static load at 0.5%
strain. Tensile tests were performed using a Zwick 1456 instrument
(model 1456, Z010; Ulm, Germany) with a crosshead speed of 200 mm/min
(DIN 53504). The tensile samples were exposed to −20 °C
for 0.5 h, and then the tensile tests were carried out at −20
°C. Time sweep and strain sweep analyses were carried out using
a dynamic mechanical thermal analyzer (Gabo Qualimeter, Ahlden, Germany,
Eplexor 2000N) in the tension mode with a rectangular specimen (10
× 2 × 35 mm3). Time sweep analysis was performed
with a dynamic load of 0.2% strain and static load at 1% strain, and
the measurement was carried out as soon as the temperature of the
chamber reached −20 °C as a function of time (20 min).
Strain sweep analysis was carried out as a function of dynamic load
from 0.01 to 30% with 40% static strain, and the sample is exposed
to −20 °C for 15 min before the measurement.

FTIR
spectroscopic analysis was performed using an evacuated Vertex 80v
FTIR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with an MCT detector
and a Golden Gate Diamond ATR unit (attenuated total reflection, SPECAC).
ATR-FTIR spectra of dry (nonswollen) and water-swollen elastomers
were recorded within the range of 4000–600 cm–1 at RT. To confirm the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the ether
groups of GECO and the water molecules, temperature-dependent ATR-FTIR
spectroscopy was performed. The dry GECO sample was heated to 120
°C and was held for about 1 h, until the water bands in the ATR-FTIR
spectrum disappeared. After that, the sample was cooled down back
to RT and held for about 21 h to allow the penetration of reversible
water vapor into the dry GECO samples. Every spectrum was obtained
with 4 cm–1 spectral resolution and 100 scans per
spectrum. Before comparison, the spectra were normalized onto the
stretching vibration band of the methylene group around 2867 cm–1 (internal reference approach27).

For transmission electron microscopy, a piece of water-swollen
specimen was cooled down to −160 °C, mounted on an ultramicrotome
chamber (Ultracut UC7, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Germany), which was
flooded with dry nitrogen at a temperature of −160 °C.
Approximately 120 nm-thick sections with dimensions of 100 ×
150 μm2 were cut with a diamond knife (temperature
of the knife −160 °C) and transferred onto a cooled TEM
grid. The grid was transferred under liquid nitrogen into a cryo-TEM
holder (Gatan 626, Gatan Inc., USA) and inspected in TEM at −170
°C.
