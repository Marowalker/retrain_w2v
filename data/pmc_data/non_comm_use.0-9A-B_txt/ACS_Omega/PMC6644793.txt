Careful product analysis
in combination with appropriate supporting
experiments unambiguously proves that in contrast to what was previously
reported, generation of the phosphonium salt from a β-cyclocitral-derived
allylic alcohol and PPh3HBr takes place via a proton-driven
elimination/addition path.

1 Introduction
In
2008, (E)-4-((3-ethyl-2,4,4-trimethylcyclohex-2-enylidene)methyl)benzoic
acid 1 was unexpectedly obtained by Das and Kabalka1 during their preparation of novel analogues of
all-trans-retinoic acid by changing the flexible
alkene backbone into a more rigid phenyl ring. This scaffold has been
later widely utilized by the same group both in the field of retinoids2,3 and in that of mitochondria-associated, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor signaling inhibitors, wherein guanidinamide 2(4a) represents the lead of a small library of molecules
(Figure 1).

the acid precursor and the lead compound as MAGMAS
inhibitors.

The relevant biological
profile of compound 2, coupled
with its ready availability, led us to use this scaffold for the construction
of a small library of structural analogues in the context of an ongoing
chemical biology project.4b Accordingly,
the precursor ester 6 of acid 1 has been
conveniently synthesized starting from β-cyclocitral 3 along the pathway outlined in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Wittig Olefination
2 Results and Discussion
In detail, the
reaction of 4-formylbenzoic acid methyl ester with
phosphorus ylides featuring the β-cyclocitral skeleton afforded
compounds 6 in place of the planned regioisomeric dienes 5. Thus, different from their expectations, the phosphonium
salts 9, not 7, were the precursors of the
pivotal ylides for the Wittig olefination reaction.

The reaction
of allylic alcohols with triphenylphosphine hydrobromide
(Ph3P·HBr) is a well-established method for the direct
preparation of allyl triphenylphosphonium bromide salts. Notably,
in the case of tertiary allyl alcohols acting as the substrates, the
phosphonium salts, where the least hindered electrophilic carbons
intercept the phosphine nucleophile, are usually observed as the major
products.5 In the specific case of allylic
alcohols 4, the formation of the two regioisomeric phosphonium
salts 7 and 11 was anticipated. The former
phosphonium salt resulted from the ipso substitution of bromide, whereas
the latter phosphonium salt resulted from its allylic displacement
(Scheme 2). Thus, 7 would have given the dienes 5, whereas 11, lacking in α-proton, would not have been exploitable
in Wittig olefination. Thus, the authors are faced with an “unusual
Wittig reaction”.

Scheme 2 Mechanism of the Unusual Wittig Reaction
In the primary6 as well as in successive
papers,7 the authors speculated that under
basic conditions (n-BuLi or t-BuONa),
the salt 11 could originate the pivotal ylide 10 for the “Wittig olefination” (Scheme 2). They envisioned that deprotonation at
methylene beta carbon of 11 triggered a 1,2-phosphorus
migration followed by an intermolecular proton shift giving ylides 10. The subsequent in situ reaction with the aromatic aldehyde
led to the unexpected dienes 6. In support of the postulated
mechanism, they reported the NMR spectral characterization of the
“unusual Wittig salt” 11 (R = Me) that
could be isolated as a yellow solid after recrystallization from methanol/ether
(1:6).

In the context of an ongoing chemical biology project,
we selected
compound 6 (R = Me) as a scaffold from which to prepare
a small library of guanidine derivatives. With the aim of arriving
to the 1,3-diene system incorporating the β-cyclocitral skeleton,
we found it convenient to follow the Das protocol. Actually, reacting 4 (R = Me) with Ph3P·HBr, after careful filtration
on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate, we obtained a white phosphonium
bromide salt in optimal yield (96%). However, much to our surprise,
its 1H NMR was importantly different from the one reported
by Das and his colleagues, which in our opinion was rather inconsistent.6 For example, the multiplicity and the integration
of signals at δ 5.5–5.7 are in accord for two protons;
the integration of aromatics is excessive (31H instead
of 15H), whereas that of methylenes appears deficient.
Conversely, the above inconsistencies were not observed in the 1H NMR recorded for the phosphonium salt in our hands to which
we assigned the formula 9 that is the one of a “usual
Wittig salt”.

From our point of view, no base-induced
conversion of 11 to 10 was involved in the
“anomalous Wittig
reaction”. More simply, our findings suggest that the ylide 10 originates from the salt 9, whose formation
requires two classical chemical steps, namely, acid-catalyzed 1,4-dehydration
of 4, followed by the 1,4-addition of triphenylphosponium
(Ph3PH+) onto the resulting diene 12 (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Proposed
Mechanism (This Work) for the Conversion of 4 into Phosphonium
Salt 9
In this work, treatment of 4 with PPh3HBr
gave cleanly, after careful filtration on silica gel (EtOAc elution,
96% yield), a new white solid, which was unambiguously assigned as
the phosphonium salt 9 (Scheme 3). The proton spectrum is depicted in Figure 2.

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra
of phosphonium salt 9.

In order to definitively confirm the mechanism proposed above,
we treated allylic alcohol 4 with hydrogen bromide in tert-butyl alcohol in the absence of triphenylphosphine,
obtaining diene 12, which was isolated and fully characterized
(Figure 3).

Figure 3 1H NMR spectra of diene 12.

The subsequent exposure to triphenylphosphine hydrobromide
in methanol
afforded the phosphonium salt 9, thereby confirming our
expectations (Scheme 4).

Isolated 1,3-Diene 12
3 Conclusions
In conclusion, in this
work, we provide convincing evidence that
treatment of allylic alcohol 4 with PPh3·HBr
does not afford the phosphonium salt 11, as reported
by Das and Evans, but the isomeric salt 9. Therefore,
rationalization of the outcome of the Wittig reaction associated with
such a phosphonium salt involves neither 1,2-P migrations nor 1,4-H+ shifts but simply an acid-promoted elimination and a regioselective
addition to a protonated 1,3-diene. This latter mechanism is supported
by strong analytical data such as monodimensional and bidimensional 1H NMR spectra and appropriate corollary experiments.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 General Information
β-cyclocitral
was purchased from commercial sources (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
All other reagents and solvents were of the highest quality available
or were freshly distilled. Melting points (uncorrected) were measured
with a Buchi–Tottoli apparatus, and 1H, 13C, 31P, and bidimensional NMR spectra were recorded on
a Varian 400 MHz instrument unless otherwise noted. Chemical shifts
are given in parts per million (δ) relative to the solvent,
and coupling constants are in hertz. The abbreviations used are as
follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, dd =
double doublet, m = multiplet, td = triple doublet, dt = double triplet,
and ddd = double double doublet. Mass spectrometry (MS) analyses were
performed on ESI Micromass ZMD 2000. High-resolution MS (HRMS) spectra
were recorded using an ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies).
Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer FT-IR Spectrum 100
spectrometer. Flash chromatography was carried out on a silica gel
(Merck, 230–400 mesh). High-performance liquid chromatography
analysis was performed by Beckman system gold 168 using a C18 Jupiter
column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) and water/acetonitrile/TFA
eluent.
