Engaging
Raman spectroscopy as a primary tool, we investigated
the early events of insulin fibrilization and determined the structural
content present in oligomer and protofibrils that are formed as intermediates
in the fibril formation pathway. Insulin oligomer, as obtained upon
incubation of zinc-free insulin at 60 °C, was mostly spherical
in shape, with a diameter of 3–5 nm. Longer incubation produced
“necklace”-like beaded protofibrillar assembly species.
These intermediates eventually transformed into 5–8 nm thick
fibers with smooth surface texture. A broad amide I band in the Raman
spectrum of insulin monomer appeared at 1659 cm–1, with a shoulder band at 1676 cm–1. This signature
suggested the presence of major helical and extended secondary structure
of the protein backbone. In the oligomeric state, the protein maintained
its helical imprint (∼50%) and no substantial increment of
the compact cross-β-sheet structure was observed. A nonamide
helix signature band at 940 cm–1 was present in
the oligomeric state, and it was weakened in the fibrillar structure.
The 1-anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonate binding study strongly suggested
that a collapse in the tertiary structure, not the major secondary
structural realignment, was the dominant factor in the formation of
oligomers. In the fibrillar state, the contents of helical and disordered
secondary structures decreased significantly and the β-sheet
amount increased to ∼62%. The narrow amide I Raman band at
1674 cm–1 in the fibrillar state connoted the formation
of vibrationally restricted highly organized β-sheet structure
with quaternary realignment into steric-zipped species.

==== Body
Introduction
Insulin is an essential
protein that interacts with specific transmembrane
cell surface receptors of muscle and adipose cells where it stimulates
a complex cell signaling pathway, leading to the transport of glucose
across the cell membrane and controls the glucose level in the bloodstream.1 It is produced in pancreatic β-cell,2 and its hexameric assembly formation and coordination
to Zn2+ stabilizes insulin in cellular environment.3 It, however, exists as a mixture of hexameric,
dimeric, and monomeric states in solution condition,4 and the thermal destabilization causes unwanted aggregation
and malfunctioning. The aggregation and formation of amyloid-like
fibril of insulin thus have long complicated its manufacture, storage,
and clinical formulation.5

It was
postulated that the B-chain segment of insulin may be a
crucial factor for insulin aggregation and fibrilization.6,7 The crystal structure reveals that insulin contains a large α-helical
structure consisting of 51 amino acid residues that are arranged into
two polypeptide chains, A (21 residues) and B (30 residues). Three
helical segments are formed by the residues, A2–A7, A13–A19,
and B10–B19. Two of the helices are in the A-chain joined by
a loop from A9 to A12 that brings the N- and C-termini together. The
B-chain helix (B10–B19) is followed by a turn at the C-terminal
end, and the N-terminal end of the B-chain is unstructured.8 Both the A and B chains of the molecule are linked
together by two interchains (between A7 and B7 and between A20 and
B19) and one intrachain disulfide bond (A6 and A11).9

Several research groups hypothesized different mechanisms
of insulin
fiber formation10−16 and examined the aggregates under many circumstances, including
low pH, different salt concentration, and hydrophobic interfaces that
mimic physiologic condition.3,17 Our earlier studies
on insulin, mini-proinsulin, and domain swap mutants explored the
secondary structural properties of globular and fibrillar forms using
Raman spectroscopy.18 In later works, Hua
et al. identified an early intermediate using solution-state NMR spectroscopy
and reported that the N-terminal helix of both the A and B chain unfolds
and detaches from the core.5 They also
suggested that the C-terminal segment of B chain also unfolds to some
extent but remains tethered to the core. Structural aspects of insulin
aggregates were investigated several times,17,19−21 and the fibril showed a parallel intermolecular β-sheet
rich secondary structure.22−25 Many of these studies suggested a three-phase process
of matured fibril formation.26 During an
initial lag phase, the protein may rearrange and position to start
to form oligomeric intermediates and in the subsequent event, start
stacking together forming elongated structures, commonly known as
protofibrils. After this state, protofibrils can eventually pack,
leading to the formation of twisted structures of mature amyloid fibrils.
Thus, the formation of these ordered aggregated species is typically
followed by a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism.27 It was reported that partially distorted non-native
insulin monomers in oligomeric geometry play a key role in the kinetics
of amyloid fiber formation28 and several
studies show that the oligomeric species are the possible cause of
cytotoxicity in amyloid disease in general.29 Therefore, uncovering the structural details of these species is
very important to understand the nucleation-dependent fibril formation mechanism.30−32

However,
structural insights of the early intermediates and their
conformational rearrangement are not well understood. Vestergaard
et al. through small-angle X-ray scattering and computational modeling
suggested that a helical structural nucleus could be the primary elongating
unit of insulin amyloid fibrils.21 The
shape and size of oligomers and their relative population in the lag
phase control the rate of fibril formation. The current investigation
attempted to provide proper coherent information about the conformational
preferences and rate kinetics throughout the fibril formation pathway.
We investigated the early stages of self-assembly and the changes
in secondary structural or conformational rearrangement of insulin
from native monomer to the fibrillar state by engaging Raman spectroscopy.
Raman spectroscopy has been well used in the structural characterization
of proteins and protein aggregates.33−35 The technique is highly
sensitive to changes in conformation and bonding pattern, and the
method is, therefore, particularly used to define the perturbation
in the secondary and/or tertiary structural alignments in proteins
in different assembly conditions. Here, we provided a definitive proof
through Raman measurement that the fibrillation process of insulin
involves the formation of a helix-rich intermediate in the lag phase;
thereafter, in the maturation state, the helical conformation rapidly
converted into the β-sheet rich structure.

Results and Discussion
We investigated the early events of self-assembly, associated conformational
rearrangement, and changes in the secondary structure of human insulin
in the fibril formation pathway, engaging Raman spectroscopy as a
primary tool. Figure 1 displays atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of different aggregate
species formed in different time intervals upon incubation of human
insulin (1.5 mg mL–1 in 20 mM HCl with 50 mM NaCl,
pH 1.8) for 3/4 h at 60 °C. For 60 min of incubation, it showed
the formation of an oligomeric assembly structure, mostly spherical,
with a diameter of 3–5 nm (Figure 1A). Pre-protofibrils were observed after
∼100 min of incubation. The length and height of these pre-protofibrils
varied up to several nanometers (Figure 1C). The surface morphology of pre-protofibrils
was rough and indicated that no organized structures were yet formed.
A more organized protofibrillar species formation was observed for
135 min of incubation, as shown in Figure 1D. The diameter of the aggregated species
was 5–8 nm. Further incubation produced a threadlike amyloid
fibril. Surface morphology showed a very smooth texture of fibrils
and suggested an organized assembly of insulin monomers into a higher
ordered assembly structure (Figure 1E,F).

Figure 2 shows the
Raman spectra of insulin monomer, oligomer, pre-protofibril, protofibrils,
and the late-state assembly structure of matured fibril, respectively. Table 1 contains the spectral
assignments of characteristic Raman bands of the protein in different
assembly conditions. The Raman spectrum of insulin monomer mainly
consisted of a broad amide I band at 1659 cm–1,
with an associated (shoulder) band at 1676 cm–1 (Figure 2A).18 The bandwidth at half maxima (BWHM) for the band was ∼49
cm–1. This large bandwidth indicated the presence
of multiple conformation states of the protein in its monomeric state.
The band at 1659 cm–1 was an indication of major
helical conformation along with a contribution from the disordered
state, as marked at 1676 cm–1.18 The amide III region (1230–1300 cm–1) was also enriched with predominant α-helical marker bands
(Figure 2A and Table 2).18,36−38 It was composed of a major shoulder band at 1262
cm–1 that marked the signature of pure helix.36,38 The signature of the extended helix/2.51-helix conformation
similar to poly-l-glutamic acid conformation was embarked
at 1268 and 1277 cm–1.39 The 1249 cm–1 shoulder was possibly due to mixed
vibrational contributions from PPII and 3/10-helix conformation from
the protein backbone structure (Table 2).38

The Raman
signature of insulin oligomer is shown in Figure 2C. It exhibited a broad amide
I Raman band at 1661 cm–1. A shoulder band appeared
at 1676 cm–1 and quite resembled the band appearing
for the monomeric state of the protein. It indicated the presence
of structural heterogeneity in the oligomeric state similar to that
of the monomer. We used a drop coating deposition Raman (DCDR) method
to collect the Raman spectrum of monomer and aggregated species.40−42 In this process, 20–30 μL of the incubated sample was
applied on a glass coverslip and air-dried. The methods helped to
collect better quality Raman spectra of protein samples when solution-state
experiments were difficult for several reasons. However, in the event
of drying and evaporation, some conversion of monomer to oligomer
formation may occur.42 Longer incubation
of the protein solution produced pre-protofibril structures. The amide
I band appeared at ∼1662 cm–1 (Figure 2E and Table 2). The Raman signature of the protein was
noticeably changed upon the transformation of pre-protofibril state
to protofibril and subsequent fibril formation. For insulin fibrils,
amide I vibration appeared at 1674 cm–1 and the
BWHM was ∼21 cm–1 (Figure 3E,F). It indicated the formation of a major
cross-β-sheet conformation of the protein in the fibrillar state.
The narrow bandwidth indicated structural homogeneity and uniformity.34 A significant reduction in band intensity was
observed for the α-helical signature amide I band at 1657 cm–1.

Figure 3 Left panel shows the Raman spectra of insulin protofibril
(A),
premature fibril (C), and fibril (E) in the frequency range of 500–1800
cm–1. Respective panels (B, D and F) in the right
present the curve-fitting analysis of extended amide I band of the
Raman spectra. Other experimental and analysis conditions were same
as that of Figure 2.

The Raman band patterns and curve-fitting
analysis to amide I band
often provide ample information related to protein backbone conformation
and its stability.18,36,37,43−46 Dong et al. and others performed
initial Raman investigation on dimeric and hexameric insulin aggregates,
measuring amide I band behavior in different sample conditions.34,47 Our laboratory also derived the structural content of amyloid aggregates
of Aβ peptides using the amide I curve-fitting protocol, as
suggested by Dong et al. and Maiti et al.34,37 In our current investigation, curve fitting to the Raman amide I
showed that ∼54% of residues in insulin monomer preferred α-helical
secondary structure and the component band was at 1658 cm–1 (Figure 2B and Table 1).18 A considerable amount (∼24%) of residues remained
in the extended/coiled structure, as indicated with a component band
at 1686 cm–1.18 β-Sheet
content was ∼9% and assigned to a component band at 1676 cm–1. Some contribution of the β-sheet secondary
structure could be the result of drying, as the DCDR method was used
to collect the Raman spectrum.42,48

Figure 2D depicts
the spectral deconvolution (curve fitting) of amide I Raman band of
oligomers. In the oligomeric state, the protein maintained its helical
imprint (50%) and found no substantial increment of the core-β-sheet
secondary structure. The deconvolution of the amide I band in the
Raman spectra of the pre-protofibrillar structure is shown in Figure 2F. We noticed some
decrease in helical signature in the pre-protofiber state compared
to that of the oligomer species. α-Helix signature of the amide
III band at 1262 cm–1 was somewhat decreased (Figure 2E and Table 2).36,38,39

Formation of insulin protofiber was
identified with the appearance
of early β-sheet content as a signature by amide I band at 1673
cm–1 (Figure 3A,B and Table 2). In the protofibril species, the helical content decreased to 37%
(the component band at 1656 cm–1), whereas the β-sheet
content increased to 29% (the component band at 1673 cm–1, Table 1). The increment
of β-sheet was due to the transformation of the helix and extended
helix into β-conformational space (Table 1).18Figure 3C,D shows the Raman
signature of early fibrils (premature, incubation time 160 min). A
considerable amount of loss in amide I helical marker band at 1657
cm–1 in comparison to the β-component band
at 1675 cm–1 and thus a significant increase in
β-sheet conformation was observed. A substantial shrinkage in
the bandwidth was also observed (44 cm–1 for protofiber,
35 cm–1 for premature fiber). A significant gain
in the β-sheet component was further established by the broad
amide III β-sheet marker band at 1222 cm–1 (Figure 3C and Table 2).36,37,49

We observed a very narrow and sharp
vibrational amide I band at
1674 cm–1 (BWHM, 21 cm–1) in the
fiber state of insulin, and a significant decrease in α-helical
signature amide I band intensity at 1657 cm–1 was
observed. It indicated a major cross-β-sheet conformation of
the protein in the fibrillar state (Figure 3C,E). In the fiber condition, the helical
content was decreased to ∼14% (component band at 1655 cm–1), whereas the β-strand content was increased
to ∼62% (component band at 1674 cm–1) and
PPII/extended conformation was also decreased to ∼14% with
a component band at 1690 cm–1 (Table 1). Amide III also showed a major
band at 1222 cm–1 for β-sheet signature and
a disappearance of the α-helical band at 1260 cm–1. The Raman bands at 1254 and 1274 cm–1 were the
marker for either molted helix or type III β-turn, respectively
(Figure 3E and Table 2).38,39Figure 4A graphically
summarizes the overall changes in the secondary structural components
with time (formation of different intermediate species), as obtained
from Raman spectroscopic analysis.

Figure 4 Changes of different secondary structural
contents of incubated
insulin over time, as obtained from the curve-fitting analysis of
Raman amide I band (Table 1). Panel (A) shows the changes in the secondary structural
component (%) against incubation time: helix (orange), β-sheet
(brown), loose β-strand, PPII and disordered (light green),
and other undefined component (deep green). Panel (B) shows the changes
in the Raman intensity of the special helical marker band at 940 cm–1 at different time points of incubation. The Raman
intensity at 1449 cm–1 was used as a reference.

In the process of insulin amyloid
formation, a significant decrease
of helical conformation was prominent, whereas extended conformations
(PPII, extended helix) were continued until the formation of mature
amyloid fiber (Table 1 and Figure 4A). The
special α-helical marker band that refers to the stretching
vibration of O=C–Cα–H linkage
of the protein backbone near 1340–1345 cm–1 was also clearly observed until the formation of fibrils (Figures 2, 3, and Table 2).38,50 The band intensity of the nonamide helix
signature band at 940 cm–1 also decreased substantially
after the lag phase completion, as compared to that of the signal
at 1434 cm–1 region enlisted for the total CH2 and CH3 deformation and CH2 scissoring
of the protein itself (Figures 4B, 2, and 3).36,49 This again suggested that no major secondary structural change happened
before the beginning of pre-protofibril formation. Some monomers may
transform into an oligomeric state in the DCDR method, and a strict
comparison of structural components in monomer and oligomeric samples
was not possible. However, our Raman analysis suggested that no major
secondary structural changes occurred until the formation of protofibril
species. The tertiary realignment could be the major force behind
oligomer formation. The 1-anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS) binding
study, as discussed later, suggested that a collapse in the tertiary
structure and opening of hydrophobic surfaces occurred prior to the
formation of protofibril species.

Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence
assay is often performed to detect
the formation of amyloid aggregates enriched with cross-β-sheet
structure.51,52 ThT possibly bound to the cradle
of cross-β-sheets of amyloid aggregates and attained a suitable
conformation that increased its fluorescence yield. Therefore, ThT
acts as a chemical probe and reports the formation of stable β-sheet
structures in the process of aggregation of many proteins and peptides.53 To determine the content of the compact cross-β-sheet
secondary structure in the different states of fibril formation, ThT
fluorescence was measured at the different time points of incubation
of the protein solution. Figure 5A displays the ThT fluorescence intensity at 485 nm
in the presence of different insulin samples incubated for making
the aggregates. The oligomers that were formed after 60 min of incubation
did not cause major fluorescence enhancement of the ThT solution,
suggesting no enhancement of cross-β-sheet structure in the
oligomers. The fluorescence enhancement was started in the presence
of protein samples incubated for ∼120 min. AFM confirmed that
the species formed at this time point of incubation was pre-protofibril.
The ThT fluorescence started increasing very rapidly in the presence
of pre-protofibrils, and it was the maximum in the presence of fibril
solution. Thus, the cross-β-sheet structural transition mainly
happened in the late state of the aggregation process.

formation, as monitored by ThT fluorescence
assay, ANS binding study, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic
measurements of insulin solution incubated for aggregation. (A) ThT

solution at different times: 0 min (black), 60 min (red), 120 min
(blue), 135 min (cyan), 160 min (pink), and 180 min (yellow). Details
are given in the Materials and Methods section,
and the species type may be inferred from Figure 1.

To further investigate the secondary structural transition
of insulin
in the fibril formation pathway, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic
analysis was performed. Figure 5C shows the CD spectrum of insulin species at the different
time points of incubation. The monomer at 0 min of incubation showed
a CD pattern similar to that of native insulin in solution. In the
oligomeric state, we observed no significant change in the CD signature.
The negative CD signal at 208 nm and at 192 nm started to change in
the pre-protofibril condition and indicated that the helical signature
started to decrease from the pre-protofibril state. The CD spectra
became quite broad (208–222 nm) in the protofibril condition
and suggested the coexistence of several protein backbone conformations.
The CD spectral signature of insulin fiber showed a strong negative
band at 218 nm and defined the presence of the compact β-sheet
structure. The deconvolution of very high quality CD spectra often
yields secondary structure components.5 However, for the aggregated samples, noise from scattering often
disturbs spectrum quality and encounters unexpected errors. Therefore,
the deconvolution of our CD spectra was avoided; it simply indicated
that a major secondary structural change occurred after oligomer formation.

1-Anilino-8-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS) binds to the exposed hydrophobic
patches/surfaces of proteins when the surface opens up. The bound
ANS produces enhanced fluorescence, and thus it enables to monitor
the relative hydrophobic surface exposure during unfolding and refolding
events, such as protein aggregation. To realize the tertiary collapse
and exposure of the hydrophobic surfaces of structured insulin, we
also performed ANS binding to the protein as monomer (0 min of incubation)
and when it formed different aggregates in the process of fibril formation.
A gradual increase in the ANS fluorescence in the presence of incubated
insulin solution was observed (Figure 5B). However, the fluorescence dropped quickly in the
presence of insulin samples incubated for more than 120 min and for
the protein sample in the exponential growth phase of fibril formation.
It appeared that the hydrophobic compact core of the protein slowly
loosened and opened up, as time progressed, from its compact globular
fold in the initial phase of aggregation. This indicated a tertiary
collapse of the globular structure, without much changing its secondary
conformation (as confirmed by CD, Raman, and ThT fluorescence results).
The exposure of hydrophobic surfaces allows ANS molecule to access
the hydrophobic surfaces. Interestingly, ANS fluorescence dropped
suddenly for the samples incubated for more than 120 min when actual
protofibril formation started. The protein molecules in amyloid fibrils
are highly organized and attained a compact cross-β sheet structure,
as indicated in Raman and CD spectra. This again caused reduction
of exposed hydrophobic surfaces as the molecules strongly associated
to form fiber with a β-sheet structure. In the intermediate
states (lag phase), the protein domain rearrangements and gradual
melting/unwinding of the tertiary structure may occur and this may
cause more and more exposure of hydrophobic surfaces. ANS could bind
these exposed surfaces and enhance its fluorescence yield. These exposed
hydrophobic surfaces eventually, however, associate strongly and get
organized in the steric zipper mode54,55 to form cross-β
sheet rich amyloid-like insulin fiber.

Conclusions
Protein
misfolding and aggregation processes are extensively studied
leading edges in biochemistry as well as in molecular medicine for
more than half a century. As such, protein aggregation and formation
of the oligomeric state and fibrillar structure are linked to several
pathologies, such as systemic amyloidosis, type II diabetes, and neurodegenerative
disorders. However, in the trajectory of protein aggregation and fibril
formation, the transition of protein monomer to oligomeric geometry
is one of the most crucial events, from both the pharmacological and
biochemical viewpoint. Our investigation on insulin fibrillization
suggested that the tertiary structural collapse was a dominating event
in the lag phase and subsequent oligomerization whereas minimal alteration
occurred in its core secondary structure. Eventually, the exposed
hydrophobic domains rapidly transformed into very organized cross-β-sheet
rich fibrillar structure and in this late event of fibrillization,
a remarkable secondary and tertiary realignment occurred in the polypeptide
backbone.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Zinc-free Insulin was
purchased from Sigma
Chemical Company (91077C). MilliQ water (Millipore Ltd., Bedford,
MA) was used in all experiments, and the pH of the solution was controlled
by using HCl. Thioflavin T and 1-anilinonapthalene-8-sulfonic acid
were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of thioflavin T (ThT) were
prepared in MilliQ water, and concentration was checked using a molar
extinction coefficient of 36 000 M–1 cm–1 at 412 nm. ThT solution was stored in dark at 4 °C.

Preparation of Insulin Aggregates
Insulin solution
for the aggregation study was prepared by dissolving zinc-free insulin
in 20 mM HCl (pH 1.8) with 50 mM NaCl. The protein concentration was
∼1.5 mg mL–1, and the final concentration
was checked by absorption measurement at 276 nm.4 Each time, the freshly prepared protein solution was incubated
for several hours at 60 °C without agitation and the formation
of aggregate species due to incubation was followed by ThT assay and
AFM using aliquots withdrawn at different time points of incubation.
The integrity of the protein solution was checked by gel electrophoresis
of the incubated samples. The gel image (Figure S2) indicated that some degradation and chemical modification
might have occurred for longer incubation. The previous investigation
also observed some changes in the chemical modification of insulin
upon incubation for a longer time.18,56

AFM Imaging
AFM images were recorded in Pico plus 5500
AFM (Agilent Technologies, Tempe, AZ) with a piezo scanner over the
range of 9 μm2. After incubation of the protein solution,
aliquots were diluted 10–50 times and 10 μL of the diluted
aliquots was drop casted onto a freshly cleaved mica surface. The
sample was dried gently using air flow. Microfabricated silicon cantilevers
of 225 μm length, with a nominal spring force constant of 21–98
N m–1 were used for imaging. The cantilever oscillation
frequency was turned into the resonance frequency of 150–300
kHz. Images were processed by flattening using Pico view software
(Molecular Imaging Corporation).

Raman Spectroscopy
A unique drop coating deposition
Raman (DCDR) method was used to collect the Raman spectrum of monomer
and aggregated species. This method was used by others in the field.40−42 Twenty to thirty microliters of the incubated insulin solution at
different time points of incubation was placed on a glass coverslip
and air-dried. Raman data were collected in the backscattering geometry
with an STR Raman microscope (AIRIX Corp, Japan) under ambient condition
(24 °C). A 633 nm He–Ne laser (model LGK 7665 P18, LASOS,
Germany) with ∼1 mW of laser power at the sample was used for
excitation. The laser was focused onto the sample through the microscope
(Olympus BX51M, Japan) using 50× objective, and Raman scattering
was collected using a 500 mm focal length triple grating monochromator
equipped with an air-cooled charge-coupled device detector. The spectra
were recorded with a typical accumulation time of 100 s. The wave
numbers of the Raman band were calibrated with the silica wafer focused
under the 50× objective, and the spectral resolution was ∼1
cm–1. The spectral data so obtained were processed
with GRAMS/A1 software.

Curve Fitting of the Amide I Profile
Amide I band of
Raman spectra is a characteristic band to investigate the changes
in the secondary structure of protein.45,57,58 The band fitting of the Raman amide I band was performed
by using the Levenberg–Marquardt nonlinear least-squares process,
as applied in the Curve Fit Ab routine of GRAMS/AI 9.02 software.59 The band region of 1575–1720 cm–1 was fitted assuming four asymmetrical component bands that represented
different structural conformations of insulin: α-helical band
at 1655 cm–1 with spectral window (1650–1660
cm–1), β-sheet component band near 1673 cm–1 (1670–1675 cm–1), polyproline
II or loose β strands and disordered structure near 1685 cm–1 (1680–1690 cm–1), and disordered
structure or vibronic coupling band near 1637 cm–1 (1630–1645 cm–1).47 During amide I band fitting, three different bands at ∼1585,
∼1604, and ∼1615 cm–1 for the ring
vibrational mode of phenylalanine and tyrosine were also included.37,43 Component bands were fitted by 15–40 cm–1 bandwidth features; Gaussian and Lorentzian functions were allowed
for homogenous and heterogeneous broadening. The standard error for
peak positions and peak widths were <5 cm–1 for
well characteristic components; this typically
introduced an uncertainty of ∼10% in the measurement of area
under each fitted curve.

Thioflavin T (ThT) Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Assay
ThT fluorescence assays were performed to investigate
insulin amyloid
fibrillation. At room temperature, 10 μL of the incubated insulin
sample at the different time points of incubation was individually
added to 700 μL of ThT solution (25 μM) and mixed properly.
The solution was excited at 440 nm and emission was recorded at 485
nm on a VARIAN CARY Eclipse fluorescence spectrometer using a 1 cm
path length quartz cuvette. The integration time and slit widths were
fixed at 1 s and 5 nm, respectively. ThT in buffer without protein
was used as a baseline.

Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectroscopy
A JASCO J-815
spectropolarimeter (Jasco) equipped with a Peltier temperature control
unit which was set to 25 °C with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C
was used to measure the protein’s secondary structure at different
times of incubation. The data acquisition interval time was 2 s. Ten
microliters of the incubated protein solution each time was mixed
with 300 μL of 20 mM HCl with 50 mM NaCl, and the final concentration
of the protein became 10 μM. Spectra were recorded using a 0.1
mm path length cell, with a 50 nm min–1 scan speed.
Three scans were averaged, and the buffer background was subtracted.

ANS Binding Assay
ANS is a specific fluorescence probe
that binds to the hydrophobic area of a protein and shows a blue shift
in its emission maximum along with a substantial increase in the fluorescence
intensity. CARY Eclipse, VARIAN spectrofluorometer was used to measure
the ANS fluorescence in the presence of insulin samples at different
time points of incubation. The final concentration of insulin and
ANS were 5 and 10 μM, respectively. The sample was excited at
370 nm. The emission range was fixed to 400–600 nm, and the
integration time and slit widths were 1 s and 5 nm, respectively.
