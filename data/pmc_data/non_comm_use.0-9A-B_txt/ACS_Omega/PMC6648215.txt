An electrolyte and aprotic solvent
mixture were used to prepare
cellulose solutions containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs). All-cellulose
composite fibers were then produced by dry–wet spinning these
solutions. The presence of CNC in the all-cellulose fibers was demonstrated,
and the effects of the CNC on the fiber properties were investigated.
The all-cellulose fibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy,
X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, and electronic tensile measurements. These results showed
that CNCs were present in the mixture and that their structure was
maintained in the all-cellulose fibers. No compatibility problems
between the CNC and cellulose II matrix were observed. Introducing
CNC enhanced the crystallinity, thermal stability, and mechanical
properties of the composite fibers.

Introduction
Cellulose
is an important green resource and is the most abundant
biopolymer on earth, with 1.5 × 1012 tons produced
each year. Cellulose has been widely studied for use in numerous applications,
leading to the development of cellulose-based composites, which can
be found in a wide range of industries such as biomedicine, textiles,
and food.

Cellulose-based materials can generally be categorized
as either
raw cellulose materials or regenerated cellulose materials. Raw cellulose
materials possess a cellulose I structure and include materials such
as paper. Regenerated cellulose materials possess a cellulose II structure
and include materials such as regenerated cellulose fiber (e.g., viscose
and lyocell fibers), cellophane, and cellulose aerogel. A previous
study1−4 showed that the different structural morphologies of cellulose I
and cellulose II result in the different properties of the raw and
regenerated cellulose materials. Notably, crystalline cellulose and
amorphous cellulose degrade below 427 °C, which is much lower
than their melting temperatures; hence, the only practical way of
shaping cellulose is by dissolution methods. Many solvent systems
have been developed for dissolving cellulose, such as 4-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMMO),5,6 NaOH/urea,7,8 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl),9 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BmimCl),10 tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF)/dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO),11 and LiCl/dimethylacetamide
(DMAc).12

Cellulose solutions can
act as dispersing media for nanoparticles,
and many nanomaterials have been incorporated into cellulose to improve
its performance and function, such as carbon nanotubes,13 graphene oxide,14 ZnO,15 and SiO2.16 However, the inherent chemical incompatibility
of cellulose and reinforcement materials often result in weak interfacial
bonding among the phases.

Monocomponent or single-polymer composites
have been prepared in
an effort to overcome this incompatibility. In 1975, Capiati and Porter
produced high-density polyethylene composites17 that possessed a gradually changing morphology between the reinforcing
fibers and matrix material. This resulted in an improved interfacial
shear strength, which was within the range of those of glass-fiber-reinforced
polyester and epoxy resin. A new class of monocomponent composites
has since emerged: the so-called all-cellulose composites (ACCs).
The concept of an ACC was first proposed by Nishino et al. in 200418 and involved preparing green composites to eliminate
chemical incompatibilities between the reinforcement and the matrix
using cellulose for both components.

Many subsequent studies
on ACC have been reported. The reinforcing
phases of ACC can generally be divided into two types. One type is
based on materials remaining after selective dissolution. Specifically,
some portion of cellulose (e.g., surface or amorphous regions) is
initially dissolved in a solvent and the remaining undissolved cellulose
becomes the reinforcing phase. Examples of this method were reported
by Nishino et al. who converted a selectively dissolved fiber surface
into a matrix.19 The other type of reinforced
phase is high crystallinity, highly aligned cellulose I matrices,
such as bleached fibers that come from plants. This matrix processing
route involves a bonding process, in which dissolved cellulose is
poured onto the matrix. The mixture undergoes a hot-pressing treatment
and is then regenerated. Relevant examples of these materials have
been reported by Adak et al., and in these studies, all cellulose
laminates were manufactured from a lyocell fabric by a hand lay-up
and compression molding-based surface-selective dissolution technique.20,21 The excellent performance of cellulose I has led to the use of cellulose
whiskers as reinforcing materials in ACC.

A key issue for preparing
CNC-reinforced ACC is obtaining a stable
mixture containing dissolved cellulose and insoluble CNC. LiCl/DMAc,22 NaOH/urea,23 and
some ionic liquids24 have been used as
dispersing/dissolution media for preparing ACC. We recently reported
that controlling the tetrabutylammonium acetate ratio in mixed solvents
could regulate cellulose solubility.25 This
finding provided a straightforward method for preparing CNC-regenerated
cellulose composites. In this study, we incorporate high-aspect-ratio
CNC into a cellulose matrix, using a solvent mixture. A schematic
diagram of the experiment is shown in Figure 1. A dry–wet spinning process was used
to improve the orientation and crystallinity of the all-cellulose
fibers. The obtained all-cellulose fibers were characterized by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and
electronic tensile measurements. These results demonstrate the existence
of CNC within the composite and allow the study of the effects of
CNC on composite properties.

all-cellulose composite
fibers.

Results and Discussion

The particle size distribution of the CNC in DMSO is shown in Figure 2g. The main equivalent
particle size distribution of the CNC was approximately 70 nm. A transmission
electron microscopy image of the CNC is shown in Figure S1.

The properties of cellulose fibers
are closely related to the rheological
properties of their solutions. To analyze the states of the mixtures,
the rheological properties of the mixtures were tested. The dynamic
viscosity characteristics of the mixtures are shown in Figure 3a. The flow curves of all mixtures
were similar to those reported for typical polymer solutions,26−28 and the mixtures exhibited typical shear thinning behavior as the
shear rate increased. The shear thinning phenomenon of the mixture
is likely caused by a shearing-induced decrease in the amount of entanglement.
The high CNC concentration (C10) also resulted in a critical shear
rate for the non-Newtonian flow transition and shifted it to a lower
shear rate, similar to that of previous reports of cellulose solutions.24,25Figure 3a also shows
that the shear viscosity increased as the concentration of CNC increased.
This result is likely caused by the CNC-enhanced entanglement of molecular
chains. The viscosities of the mixtures were low compared with that
of cellulose solution (8 wt %),29 which
we attribute to the low solid content. The non-Newtonian indices of
all mixtures were less than 1, and the shear stress curve reflected
typical pseudoplastic fluid characteristics (Figure 3b). Sol systems are generally considered
to be typical pseudoplastic fluids, whereas the gel polymer and the
general dispersion have a dilatant flow. These data indicate that
addition of CNC/DMSO did not alter the structural characteristics
of the solution and did not promote gelation of the solution.

Figure 3 Rheological
properties of the cellulose solution/CNC mixtures:
(a) viscosity–shear rate curves, (b) flow curves, (c) storage
and loss moduli curves, and (d) phase angle.

The storage modulus (G′) and loss
modulus
(G″) reflect the state of CNC in the mixture,
as shown in Figure 3c. When CNCs were dissolved in the mixture, the values of G′ and G″ increased considerably,
owing to the increased cellulose molecular chains in solution. Many
reports have shown that a certain molecular chain content is sufficient
to influence G′ and G″.
If the degree of gelation of the mixture increases, the storage modulus
(G′) will increase considerably and the intersection
of G′ and G″ will
move to a lower frequency. The storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) of the mixture
are shown in Figure 3c. For all mixtures, G′ increased more rapidly
with G″ as the frequency increased. In terms
of the absolute values of the modulus, both G′
and G″ increased slightly as the CNC concentration
increased from 0 to 10.0%. In comparing the C10 and C0 moduli intersections,
the intersection of C10 shifted to a lower frequency, which also suggested
that the intermolecular distance of molecular chains in solution decreased.
These results indicate that the degree of entanglement in the solution
was not markedly increased and the degree of gelation was not notably
enhanced. The increase of G′ and G″ might be caused by the high aspect ratio of the solution
in the mixture of the CNC and solvent, owing to the entanglement of
molecular chains.30Figure 3d shows phase angle data for the mixtures,
with a phase angle of 90° for liquids and 0° for solids.
As the frequency increased, the phase angles of all of the mixtures
decreased and the phase angle of C10 remained the smallest. Hence,
the solid properties of the solution increased slightly after addition
of CNC. The above data indicate that addition of CNC/DMSO only slightly
changed the mixture structure.

FT-IR spectra of the pure regenerated
cellulose fiber and the all-cellulose
composite fibers were recorded to investigate their interactions with
the regenerated cellulose (Figure 4). All spectra exhibited similar profiles. The absence
of additional peaks in the spectra of the composite fibers indicated
that all samples had similar molecular structures, consisting only
of cellulose, and no other derivatives were formed during the preparation.

Figure 4 FT-IR
spectra of the all-cellulose composite fibers with different
CNC contents.

All spectra contained
peaks at 3379, 2903, 1641, 1434, 1038, and
899 cm–1, which were assigned to the O–H
stretching, C–H stretching, O–H bending of water in
amorphous regions, C–O–C stretching, C–H deformation
vibrations, and O–H bending vibrations, respectively.31 The wavenumber of the O–H stretching
band shifted as the CNC content increased, from 3438 cm–1 for the neat regenerated cellulose fibers to 3423 cm–1 for composite fibers containing 5.0 and 7.5 wt % of CNC. This shift
may have resulted from enhanced hydrogen bonding interactions between
the −OH groups of the CNC and the cellulose matrix as a greater
amount of CNC was added. In addition, the 2900 cm–1 peak is composed of two small peaks near 2903 and 2893 cm–1. Notably, 2900 cm–1 is the −CH vibration
of cellulose I and 2893 cm–1 is the −CH vibration
of cellulose II;32 hence, the cellulose
composite fiber is a typical mixed crystalline cellulose material
in which the crystal structure of nanocellulose is retained.

TGA and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves of the samples
are shown in Figure 5a. Incorporating CNC improved the thermal stability of the all-cellulose
fibers. The initial degradation temperature (Ti) and maximum degradation temperature (Td) of the all-cellulose fibers increased with the increasing
CNC content. The Ti and Td of C10 were 282.8 and 341.3 °C, respectively, which
were 10.5 and 14.9 °C higher than the corresponding values for
the pure regenerated cellulose fiber (272.3 °C for Ti and 326.4 for Td). Figure 5b shows that all
peaks of the composite moved to higher temperatures after addition
of CNC. This result indicates that the presence of CNC improved the
thermal stability of the all-cellulose fibers. Cellulose I is thermally
more stable than cellulose II.33,31 Thus, adding CNC improved
the thermal stability of the all-cellulose composite fibers. The char
residues of C10, C7.5, and C5.0 were higher than that of the neat
regenerated cellulose fiber. This result might be attributed to the
surface of the CNC exhibiting flame-retardant properties, which acted
as a catalyst for dehydration and thermal degradation of CNC, resulting
in the increased char residue. The char residue acted as an insulator
and mass transport barrier to the volatile products generated during
decomposition of the cellulose matrix.

Figure 5 (a) DTG and (b) TGA curves
of the all-cellulose composite fibers
with different CNC contents.

The tensile strength, elongation at break, and Young’s
modulus
of the all-cellulose fibers were measured to investigate the effects
of CNC on their mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of
the cellulose fiber were also measured for comparison. These data
are summarized in Figure 6. The addition of CNC at any concentration improved the tensile
strength of the all-cellulose fibers. When the CNC content was 2.5
wt %, the tensile strength was 300.2 MPa, which was slightly higher
than that of the neat cellulose fiber. When the CNC content was increased
to 5.0 wt %, the tensile strength increased to 365 MPa. The CNC contents
of 7.5 and 10.0 wt % resulted in tensile strengths of 384 and 400.3
MPa, respectively. This finding could be related to the percolation
model. In this study, the percolation threshold was 2.5–5.0
wt %. When the CNC content was lower than the percolation threshold,
the tensile strength was slightly higher than C0. The main reason
for the enhanced tensile strength was that the CNC had better mechanical
properties than the regenerated cellulose. The addition of CNC also
improved the degree of crystallinity of the all-cellulose fibers.
At CNC concentrations higher than the percolation threshold, the CNC
formed a network, which markedly improved the mechanical properties
of the all-cellulose fibers. Similar results were observed for the
Young’s modulus of the all-cellulose fibers. When the CNC contents
were 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 wt %, the Young’s moduli were
822, 1194, 2160, 2688, and 2994 MPa, respectively. Adding 2.5 wt %
CNC slightly improved the elongation at break of the all-cellulose
fibers; however, CNC concentrations higher than 5.0 wt % reduced the
elongation at break. We conclude that the network of CNC resulted
in all-cellulose fibers, which had a high stiffness leading to a low
elongation at break. This phenomenon has also been observed for other
CNC composites.34,35

Figure 6 Mechanical properties of the all-cellulose
composite fibers with
different CNC contents.

The XRD patterns of the CNC and the all-cellulose composites
are
shown in Figure 7.
The diffraction peaks at 14.9, 16.2, 20.5, 22.4, and 34.3° 2θ
were the characteristic of cellulose I,10,36 and those
at 12.4, 20.4, and 34.2° 2θ were the characteristic of
cellulose II.37,38 In the XRD patterns of the CNC,
peaks at 14.9, 16.2, 20.5, 22.4, and 34.3° 2θ were observed.
Their presence indicated that the CNCs were composed of typical natural
cellulose with a cellulose I crystal structure. The degree of crystallinity
was 72.3%, as calculated by the Jade 5.0 software package. For the
all-cellulose composite fibers, the intensities of the cellulose I
and cellulose II diffraction peaks increased with the increasing CNC
content. C2.5 had a similar profile to that of C0, which indicated
that its structure had not notably changed. The XRD patterns of C5.0,
C7.5, and C10.0 showed a peak at 12.6° 2θ, which indicated
that adding CNC enhanced crystallization of cellulose II. The degrees
of crystallinity of C5.0, C7.5, and C10.0 were 37.1, 40.6, and 45.1%,
respectively. The characteristic diffraction of the CNC at 22.2°
2θ was also detected in the XRD patterns of C7.5 and C10.0,
owing to their higher CNC content. This result indicated that CNCs
with a cellulose I structure were present in the composite fibers.

Figure 7 XRD patterns
of the CNC and all-cellulose composite fibers with
different CNC contents.

The densities of C0 and C10 were 1.37 and 1.41 g/cm3, respectively (Table 1). These differences are related to the mechanical properties, and
the increase of the density is attributed to the increase of crystallinity
caused by high-density CNC addition and crystallization effects. These
results are consistent with our XRD findings.

SEM images of the cross sections and surfaces of the
all-cellulose
fibers (Figures 8 and 9) showed that increasing the CNC content did not
notably affect the morphology. The composite fibers exhibited smooth
surfaces and uniform cross sections. The phase interface could not
be detected in the cross-sectional SEM images; hence, the compatibility
between the matrix and reinforcing phase was good because both were
composed of cellulose. The surface SEM images of the all-cellulose
fibers showed cylindrical structures with smooth surfaces. Increasing
the CNC content resulted in a small number of defects appearing on
the surfaces of the all-cellulose fibers. This result might be caused
by a small degree of agglomeration of CNC dispersed in the all-cellulose
fibers.

Conclusions
A
cellulose solution containing CNC was prepared with a TBAA/DMSO/cellulose
solution and a suspension of CNC in DMSO. All-cellulose composite
fibers were then prepared by dry–wet spinning of the mixtures.
The structures, morphologies, and mechanical properties of the all-cellulose
composite fibers were characterized. FT-IR spectroscopy and XRD confirmed
the presence of CNC within the composite fibers. SEM images showed
that the morphology of the composite fibers did not markedly change
as the CNC content increased from 2.50 to 10.0 wt %. The addition
of CNC enhanced the crystallinity, tensile strength, and Young’s
modulus of the fibers. The tensile strength of the cellulose fiber
was 320 MPa and increased to 400 MPa upon addition of 10.0 wt % CNC.
Addition of CNC initially increased and then subsequently decreased
the elongation at break of the all-cellulose fibers. DTG and TGA measurements
showed that the presence of CNC increased the thermal stability of
the all-cellulose fibers.

Experimental Section
Materials
Needle
wood pulp with DP = 650 and α-cellulose
content 92 wt % was supplied by Asia Symbol Co., Ltd., Rizhao, P.
R. China. Cellulose powder (W100, α-cellulose content of ≥95%)
was supplied by Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. Tetrabutylammonium
acetate was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
P. R. China. Dialysis tubing with a molecular weight cutoff of 8000–14 000,
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), and sodium bromide (NaBr)
were provided by Aladdin Industrial Co., Shanghai, P. R. China. Analytically
pure dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric
acid (HCl aq.), and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO aq.) were purchased
from Beijing Chemical Works.

Preparation of CNC Suspensions in DMSO
The CNCs were
prepared by the Saito method.39 Specifically,
approximately 5 g of needle wood pulp was suspended in deionized water
(500 mL) containing TEMPO (0.1 g) and NaBr (0.5 g). The resulting
mixture was homogenized by mechanical stirring at 200 rpm for 2 h.
A 25 mM portion of aqueous NaClO (10 wt %) was slowly added to the
suspension with mechanical stirring at 300 rpm to start the oxidization
at room temperature. Throughout the reaction, the pH was maintained
at 10.0–10.2 by addition of 0.5 M NaOH. When the pH stabilized,
the reaction was quenched by addition of ethanol (20 mL). Then, 0.5
M HCl was slowly added to the mixture until the pH was neutral. The
mixture was then transferred to a dialysis bag and dialyzed in deionized
water for 72 h to remove residual small molecules. The resulting aqueous
suspension was then subjected to solvent exchange in a DMSO dispersion
by centrifugation. The suspension was then homogenized using an Ultra-Turrax
(IKA) at 12 000 rpm for 15 min. Finally, the mixture was treated
with a high-pressure viscolizer for 10 passes at 850 MPa to yield
a CNC suspension in DMSO. Different concentrations of CNC suspensions
(0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 wt %) were obtained by diluting this suspension.
The size distributions of the CNC/DMSO suspensions are shown in Figure 2; the equivalent
grain size of the obtained CNC was 40–50 nm.

Preparation
of Well-Dispersed Cellulose/CNC Mixtures
Transparent cellulose
solutions were prepared by dissolving cellulose
powder (8.0 wt %) in a 1:4 weight ratio TBAA/DMSO solvent mixture
and then stirring at 60 °C for 8 h. Each of the above-described
CNC suspensions was then mixed with the cellulose solution in a weight
ratio of 0.8:1. The resulting mixtures were stirred for 30 min at
room temperature to obtain cellulose/CNC solutions.

Preparation
of Composite Fibers
Regenerated all-cellulose
fibers were prepared by dry–wet spinning. Specifically, the
above-prepared well-dispersed cellulose/CNC mixtures were spun into
a coagulating bath at 25 °C. The spinneret needle inner diameter
was 240 μm. The air gap distance was 1.0 cm, and the extrusion
velocity was 0.6 mL/min. The draw speed was 15 m/min. After the dry–wet
spinning, the gel-like fibers were washed and dried with heat rollers
at 120 °C to obtain dry fibers. The CNC contents of the fibers
were controlled to be 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 wt %. The final composite
fibers are denoted Cx, where x indicates
the CNC content in wt %. For comparison, neat regenerated cellulose
fibers with no CNC (denoted C0) were prepared under the same conditions.

Characterization
The rheological properties of the
mixtures were determined from viscometry and oscillatory measurements,
which were acquired using a rheometer (Bohlin CVO-100-901, Malvern,
U.K.) equipped with a PP40 plate measuring system at 25 °C. Density
determination was performed by aerometry with a 10 mL pycnometer filled
with water at 25 °C. The initial sample weight, W1, was 2 g. The weight at 25 °C when water was added
to the 10 mL pycnometer was recorded as W2. Samples were added to the pycnometer. The temperature was maintained
for 24 h and water was added to the scale, and the final weight was
defined as W3. The fiber density was calculated
by eq 1. The tensile
strength and mechanical elongation of the fiber samples were measured
at room temperature using an electronic tensile tester (Instron 5848,
Germany), with an extension rate of 1 cm/min. The sample length was
20 mm. The reported values for each sample were averages of 30 tests.
The SEM images, XRD patterns, FT-IR spectra, and TGA data were recorded
by our early reported method.40 1
