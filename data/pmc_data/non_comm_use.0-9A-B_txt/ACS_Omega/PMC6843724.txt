In
this work Ni(II) and Cr(III) adsorption on Durvillaea
antarctica surface were studied, optimal condition
of pH, adsorption time is achieved at pH 5.0, with contact times of
240 and 420 minutes for a maximum adsorption capacity of 32.85 and
102.72 mg g–1 for Ni(II) and Cr(III), respectively.
The changes in the vibration intensity of the functional groups detected
in the starting material by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
and the opening of the cavities after the biosorption process detected
by scanning electron microscopy images suggested the interaction of
the metal ions with the surface and the changes in the chemical behavior
of the solid. The heavy metal adsorption equilibrium data fitted well
to the Sips model. The effect of competitive ions on adsorption equilibrium
was also evaluated, and the results showed that the two metals compete
for the same active sites of the biosorbent; the increase of the Ni(II)
initial concentration increases its adsorption capacity but decreases
the adsorption capacity of Cr(III).

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heavy metal pollution
has become a major worldwide problem;1,2 the high toxicity
of these pollutants at low concentrations, also
their capacity to accumulate in soil and water, hence their bioaccumulation
in plant and animal tissues2 and their
biomagnification in the food chain are particularly worrying, which
cause ecological problems and also human health issues.3 Industrial activities such as electroplating,
which is the process to produce a protective metal coating to provide
corrosion resistance, ease cleaning procedures, and increase surface
hardness, discharge a significant amount of heavy metals into the
environment.1 Chrome plating and nickel
plating are techniques of electroplating to produce a thin layer of
chromium and nickel onto a surface, respectively. The uncontrolled
release of effluents with high concentrations of these metals as a
by-product of this activity commonly used in the industry has been
reported.4

As mentioned earlier,
among the discharges contaminated by heavy
metals are those from electroplating, specifically with nickel and
chrome; these ion metals are the Ni(II), Cr(III),4,5 and
Cr(VI)2 ions, and the maximum permissible
limits for industrial discharge are 3.0,6 1.0, and 0.1 mg L–1,7 respectively. The permissible limit of Ni(II) and Cr(VI) in drinking
water is 0.58 and 0.05 mg L–1,9 respectively. The maximum concentration
of total chromium in drinking water established by the Environmental
Protection Agency is 100 μg L–1.10,11

A high concentration of nickel in water for human consumption,
affects human health, causing kidney and lung disorders, dermatitis
and gastrointestinal damage. Chromium causes skin diseases, lung carcinoma,
among others,6 mainly when they accumulate
in living tissues,5 Cr(III) is less toxic
than Cr(VI) and acts as an essential microelement in mammals. Toxicity
of Cr(VI) is associated with its high redox potential and mobility,
also the ability to penetrate biological membranes.2 In addition, nickel and chromium are mutagenic and carcinogenic.12

To mitigate the effects of this problem,
industries have installed
different water purification systems, including ion exchange, membrane
filtration, precipitation, oxidation, and electrochemical treatments.
Unfortunately, the use of other reagents and the energy cost of these
processes increase the cost-efficiency ratio,4 promotes the formation of harmful byproducts,2 and their application is limited to a low concentration
range (1–100 mg L–1) of the metal ion.12 An alternative to replace these water treatment
methods is the adsorption using natural adsorbents in a process called
biosorption.12

Biosorption is an
environmental remediation method that uses living
or dead biomass to reduce the amount of toxic components present in
aqueous solution.8 This technique has gained
interest because of its high efficiency,12 low cost, for being an environmentally friendly process,12,13 short reaction time, does not generate sludge, easy regeneration
of the biosorbents, does not require nutrients (nonliving biomass),
and the metal can be recovered.8 A wide
variety of biomass has been used for biosorption, including aquatic
plants such as Hydrilla, Cabomba, waste tea factories, fungal biomass,
and algae.4

One of the most promising
biomass to be used as biosorbents is
the algae, the biosorption capacity of algae biomass relies on its
chemical structure, the functional groups present can interact with
metal ions. Therefore, different adsorption mechanisms can occur,
including electrostatic attraction, cation exchange, formation of
superficial metal complexes, hydrogen bond, and microprecipitation.5 Another important aspect is its high abundance
and availability in the oceans and its physical and chemical stability
over long periods of time.14 There are
three types of macroalgae: red (Rhophyta), green
(Chlorophyta), and brown (Phaeophyceae),3,13 all have cell walls consisting of complex networks of biopolymers,
cellulose as skeleton, fibrous parts, and a matrix of specific polysaccharides
such as sulfated mucopolysaccharides (fucoidan), proteoglycans, alginates
(mannuronic and guluronic acids) complexed with metal ions of alkali
and alkali-terrous such as K(I), Na(I), Mg(II), and Ca(II) and other
molecular components that depend of the type of algae.5,13 Of the three types of algae mentioned above, it has been shown that
brown algae are the most efficient in bioadsorption of heavy metals,
alginates have a high affinity for divalent cations and sulfated polysaccharides
give account of the uptake of trivalent cations.14,15 Also, algal biomass has been used to adsorb organic pollutants such
as phenanthrene, phenol and nonylphenol,13 colorants, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.3 The efficacy of biosorption to remove different pollutants depends
on solution pH, effluent composition, biosorbent concentration, temperature,
and reaction kinetics.53,5

Different materials are used as adsorbents for the removal of single
metal ions, but multicomponent metal systems make it difficult to
perform biosorption studies. Therefore, the mechanism of biosorption
in the presence of two or more metals is complex and difficult to
understand. This system depends on the pH, temperature, number of
solutes and their concentrations, the type of interaction between
the ions of different metals, and the anchoring sites of each ion
on the surface of the biosorbent.1,5 This research
has the objective of studying the simple biosorption of Ni(II) and
Cr(III) ions and competitive between Ni(II)–Cr (III) and Ni(II)–Cr(VI)
ions on the surface of the brown algae Durvillaea antarctica.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Biomass
and Preparation
A fresh D. antarctica brown algae sample was washed with
distilled water to remove salt and impurities, and then was dried
at 40 °C in an oven (Memmert, Germany) for 72 h. The dry material
was then cut into small pieces before being ground using a hammer
mill. Dry grounded biomass was sieved at 500–1000 μm
of particle size, and the material was used for all the experiments.

2.2 Physicochemical Characterization of Biomass
2.2.1 Thermogravimetric Analysis
The
thermal behavior of the starting biomass was evaluated by Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA)–DTG between 30 and 900 °C with a heating
rate of 10 °C min–1, under an atmosphere of
N2 (Cryogas) with a flow rate of 100 cm3 min–1. A thermogravimetric analyzer (Hitachi TGA/SDTA model
7200) was used. TGA was also used to determine the maximum rate of
mass loss of organic compounds, moisture, and ash.16

2.2.2 Textural Properties
The porous
structure of the biomass was determined by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms at −196 °C using an IQ2 sortometer
(Quantachrome Instruments, Miami, FL, USA) and its software to calculate
the textural characteristics: BET area and pore size distribution
by BET and Dubinin–Astakhov models.29,30 Prior to measurements, the biomass was degassed at 70 °C in
an inert atmosphere for 6 h to remove moisture or contaminants preadsorbed
on the biomass.17

2.2.3 Boehm
Titration Method
Biomass
surface chemistry was characterized by the titration method, and the
content of acidic and basic surface functional groups can be quantified
by the analysis of acid-basic titrations. Then, 0.500 g of biomass
was put in contact with 50 mL of 0.1 M basic solutions of different
strength, NaOH, Na2CO3, or NaHCO3 (Sigma-Aldrich), in different containers. Similarly, 50 mL of 0.1
M HCl was added to determine the total basicity. The mixtures were
kept at 25 °C with constant stirring for 48 h. Subsequently,
10 mL of each solution was titrated with 0.1 M standard solutions
of HCl or NaOH for basic and acidic group determination, respectively.18

2.3 Determination of Optimum
pH
In order
to investigate the effect of pH on Ni(II) and Cr(III) ion biosorption,
solutions of 50 mg L–1 Ni(II) and Cr(III) from their
respective precursors NiCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Cr2(SO4)3 (Sigma-Aldrich) at different
initial pH values (2, 3, 4, 5, and 5.5) were prepared. The pH was
adjusted with 0.1 M NaOH or 0.1 M HCl, and 50 mL of each solution
at different pH was prepared and 50 mg of biomass was added. The flasks
were shaken for 7 h at 160 rpm at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C)
with a shaker (Lab-Line Instruments, Mistral Multi Mixer, India).
Then each solution was filtered with a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
0.45 μm membrane and was poured into a propylene tube. The samples
were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) (PerkinElmer,
Analyst 300, EE.UU.).1 The metal adsorption
capacity in equilibrium was calculated according to eq 1 1  where V is the volume of
the metal solution (mL), Ci and Ce are the initial and equilibrium concentration
of metal in solution (mg L–1), and m is the amount
of biomass (g).

2.4 Determination of Equilibrium
Time
Fifty milligrams of biomass were added in 50 mL of 50
mg L–1 Ni(II) or Cr(III) solutions, and the pH of
the solutions was adjusted
according to the optimum value obtained in Section 2.3. Flasks were shaken at 160 rpm at room
temperature (20 ± 1 °C). Samples were taken at 5, 10, 30,
60, 120, and 240 min.

2.5 Biosorption Experiments
The biosorption
experiments were carried out in 50 mL polypropylene flasks containing
50 mL of Ni(II) or Cr(III) metal ion solutions at different concentrations
whose concentration ranged from 7.5 to 300 mg·L–1 at pH 5, and 50 mg of algae biomass. The solutions were maintained
in agitation at 160 rpm during the time required to reach the equilibrium
(previously determined as described in Section 2.4) at 20 ± 1 C, which was 240 and 420
min for Ni(II) and Cr(III), respectively. After reaching the equilibrium,
the solutions were filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF membrane.
The filtrate was analyzed to determine the final concentration at
the end of the process by AAS.

The equilibrium data were adjusted
to Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson, Sips, and Toth isotherm
models to describe the biosorption phenomena on the D. antarctica surface.

2.6 Biomass
Analysis PostBiosorption
2.6.1 SEM Analysis
Scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) micrographs were obtained on a JEOL model 6490-LV
microscope. The procedure consists of placing small fragments of the
sample on a metallic surface to obtain the maximum contrast in the
photograph. The sample is transferred to the SEM chamber, and an acceleration
voltage of 5 kV is observed at different magnification (between 100
and 10 000×).

2.6.2 Calorimetric Experiments
Determination
of immersion enthalpies were performed using a homemade heat conduction
calorimeter (Calvet type). The immersion liquids used for the calorimetric
characterizations were water and nickel and chromium solutions (300
mg L–1). To determine the immersion enthalpies,
a 0.050 g of biomass was weighed in a glass bulb and then it was attached
to the calorimetric cell. Then, 8 mL of the desired solvent was added
to the calorimetric cell and the calorimeter was assembled and left
until thermal stability conditions were reached, and it is associated
to the electrical potential data collected for approximately 30 min,
until a stable baseline was obtained. Once thermal equilibrium was
achieved, the glass bulb was immersed in the solvent; the resulting
effect was recorded until a stable baseline was obtained. Recordings
were then continued for an additional 20 min after immersion, followed
by electrical calibration of the calorimeter.19

2.6.3 Infrared Spectroscopy
The identification
of surface groups on the solid was examined by infrared spectroscopy
in a Nicolet Impact 410 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
The sample was pulverized with KBr, and a pellet was formed.

2.7 Adsorption Models
Because of the
availability of the software, the linearization of the equilibrium
data is used to estimate the parameters of the nonlinear models; however,
the transformation of linear nonlinear equations increases the error
of the analysis by altering the distribution of the data. The nonlinear
regression method is more complex and is recommended for estimation
of model parameters.20

2.7.1 Freundlich
Model
The Freundlich
model is described by an empirical equation used for systems with
a high degree of heterogeneity. In this model it is assumed that adsorption
occurs at different sites and the formation of multilayers with different
adsorption energy. This leads to an exponential decrease of energy
as the surface is covered.21

The
Freundlich isotherm model is described by eq 2 2  where Qe (mg g–1) is the absorption capacity of the metal
by brown D. antarctica algae in equilibrium, Ce (mg L–1) is the concentration
of the
metal in equilibrium, KF (mg g–1 (L mg–1) 1/n) and nF are the Freundlich isotherm constant representing the
maximum capacity of biosorption and intensity, respectively. The Freundlich
constant (nF) depends on the adsorption
capacity and is used to evaluate the adsorption favorability. The
values of nF between 2 and 10 indicate
a high adsorption capacity, while values between 1 and 2 indicate
moderate adsorption capacity, and values lower than 1 indicate poor
adsorption capacity.22

2.7.2 Langmuir Model
The Langmuir model
is based on the assumption that adsorption occurs on a homogeneous
site, where each adsorbate molecule occupies an specific adsorption
site, and the maximum adsorption occurs with the formation of the
complete monolayer, in which, there is no migration of the adsorbate
molecules on the adsorbent surface.23

The Langmuir isotherm model is described by eq 3 3  where qm (mg g–1) is the maximum
adsorption capacity of the bioadsorbent
and KL (L mg–1) is the
equilibrium constant of Langmuir related to the biosorption energy.

2.7.3 Sips Model
The two previous isotherm
models have been widely used to analyze the biosorption of various
contaminants present in aqueous solutions. The Sips model simultaneously
involves the Freundlich and Langmuir models, and also has three parameters
taken from the theory of these models24 and has more capacity to describe the biosorption equilibrium.

The Sips isotherm model is described by eq 4 4  where Ks (L mg–1)1/ns is the
equilibrium Sips constant and nS (-) is
the heterogeneity factor; a value of nS close to or equal to 1 occurs in biosorbents with homogeneous active
sites,25 whereas a value of nS close to 0 occurs in biosorbents with heterogeneous
active sites.26

2.7.4 Redlich–Peterson
Model
Redlich
and Peterson include the characteristics of both the Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherms in a single equation.

The Redlich–Peterson
isotherm model is described in eq 5 5  where KRP is the
constant of the Peterson–Redlich model (L/g) arp is another constant of the Peterson–Redlich
model (mg/L)−g and g is the exponent of this model and must be between 0 < g ≤ 1.

When g = 1 the Redlich–Peterson
equation
becomes the Langmuir eq 6. 6  

When g = 0, the equation of Redlich–Peterson
becomes the law of Henry (eq 7).22,27 7  

2.7.5 Toth Model
The Toth model presents
an asymmetric quasi-Gaussian energy distribution of the adsorption
sites, where most sites have lower adsorption energy than the maximum
adsorption energy peak.21 Toth modifies
the Langmuir equation in order to reduce the error between the experimental
data and the data modeled by the adsorption equilibrium. This model
fits to heterogeneous systems in which adsorption occurs in multiple
layers. The exponent of the Toth isotherm (nT0) is related to the heterogeneity of the surface,
if nT0 is
equal to the unit, the Toth model is reduced to the Langmuir model;
this suggests that the adsorption occurs on a homogeneous surface.22 This correlation is applied for liquid–solid
adsorption.27

The model of the Toth
isotherm is reported in eq 8 8  bT0 and nT0 are constants of
the model.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Physicochemical Characterization of D. antarctica
TGA was used to assess the
degradation of the biomass under increasing temperature, providing
qualitative information on the composition, based on the temperature
ranges in which it degraded. The present study applied TGA under N2 (i.e., pyrolysis) (Figure 1).

Figure 1 TG-TGA of the brown algae D. antarctica biomass.

The brown algae D. antarctica decomposition
occurred in four stages as has been reported in the literature.16 There was an initial mass loss starting at 30
°C until 300 °C, the slope change was associated with a
process of desorption of free and anchored water to the matrix of
the algae D. antarctica and the decomposition
of protein, soluble carbohydrates, and hemicellulose. The second temperature
interval ranged from 300 to 400 °C describes a strong loss of
mass with three differenced processes; these are related to the rapid
decomposition of cellulose, lipids, and insoluble polysaccharides.
Subsequently a mass loss was observed in the temperature range of
400–600 °C, the mass loss in this interval has been attributed
mainly to decomposition of lignin and insoluble polysaccharide residues.
Finally, in the temperature interval ranged from 600 to 800 °C
inorganics and residual organics were decomposed. The ash contents
of the algae D. antarctica was 15%
approximately.

Although the nitrogen adsorption isotherms (Figure 2a) are not a conventional
method for characterizing
algae-type biosorbents, it can be observed that the capacity of nitrogen
adsorption is low and as expected has a low area, with a wider pore
size distribution centered between 8 and 30 Å (Figure 2b),17 which indicates that the biosorption process will be determined
by the establishment of specific interactions between the surface
groups and the ions in solution.

Figure 2 (a) N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm. (b) Pore
size distribution.

The Boehm method is a
chemical method to identify surface functional
groups, is based on the neutralization of the acid groups present
on the surface by using basic solutions of different strength,18 according to the results a concentration of
acid groups associated with the presence of carboxylic acids and lactonic
and phenolic groups is observed, these groups come from the main compounds
of brown algae type D. antartica which
include the sulfated polysaccharides, which consist mainly of galactose,
methylated sugars, and anhydrides (Table 1).28 On the other
hand, the most important saccharide structures found in the extracts
of these organisms are fucoidans, laminarins, galactans, and alginates. Figure 3 shows some of the
possible compounds already determined by other techniques and extraction
of these algae, such as d-mannuronic and l-guluronic
acids and fucodiphlorethol-Etbl1.28−30

Figure 3 Basic structures of marine
algal polysaccharides: d-mannuronic
and l-guluronic acids and fucodiphlorethol-E.

Table 1 Boehm Method Results
sample	carboxylic (μmol g–1)	lactonic (μmol g–1)	phenolic (μmol g–1)	total acidity (μmol g–1)	total basicity (μmol g–1)	
biomass	39.27	557.3	1241	1838	1819	
These compounds consist of several
functional groups, such as carboxyl,
hydroxyl, sulfate, phosphate, and amino groups, which play a very
important role in the metal biosorption process. The mechanism of
interaction of metal ions and algae biomass will always be affected
by the characteristics of the biomass, the species and ionic charges
of the metal ions, and other external factors such as pH and temperature
of the solution as will be discussed later. According to Boehm titration,
the surface groups presented on the biomass surface are mainly acidic,
among these the phenolic groups have the higher concentration (1241
μmol g–1), coherently with the composition
of the main structures as mentioned before.28,30

As for the total basicity parameter (1819 μmol g–1), it can be attributed to the electron density given
by the delocalized
π electrons located in the double bonds of the constituents
of the algae, as well as to terpene-like structures.28 A higher concentration of weak acid groups with respect
to the basic ones, is also related to the point of zero net proton
charge reported in the literature for this biomass, which is 5.54.29

3.2 Determination of the Optimum
pH for the Adsorption
of Ni(II) and Cr(III)
In the pH diagram for the nickel species
in aqueous solution presented in Figure 4a it is observed that in nickel solutions
whose pH values are below 8, the Ni(II) species predominates. In the
range of pH 8–11, nickel is present in the form of Ni(OH)+. Above a pH of 8.5, a Ni(OH)2 precipitate forms
and above pH 11, Ni(OH)3– and Ni(OH)42– anions are formed, which are formed by
dissolving the Ni(OH)2 precipitate.31

Figure 4 pH diagrams for (a) nickel and (b) chromium species.

In the pH diagram for the chromium species in aqueous solution
(Figure 4b), it is
observed that in a pH higher than 6 the Cr(III) species are hydroxylated
and precipitate in the form of Cr(OH)3. In this speciation
diagram of Cr(III), the molar distributions of the chromium species
according to the pH value are distributed as follows: Cr3+ (≈90%), CrOH2+ (≈10%) at pH 3; Cr3+ (≈40%), CrOH2+ (≈60%) at pH 4; and Cr3+ (≈5%), Cr(OH)2+ (≈70%), and Cr3 (OH)45+ (≈20%) a pH 5.32,33

The adsorption capacity of materials can be affected by the
concentration
of proton ions in the solution.34 Therefore,
pH control is important to retain effectively the metal ions in the
biosorbent. The optimal value depends on the nature of the adsorbent
that is used.35

In Figure 5a it
is observed that as the pH of the aqueous solution of Ni(II) increases,
the QpH (adsorption capacity for each
pH value) of this ion on the surface of D. antarctica increases to a value of pH of 5.5. In Figure 5b it is observed that QpH of the Cr3+ ion also increases as the pH value
increases to 5.5. When increasing the pH, the adsorption of the chromium
ion on the surface of D. antarctica decreases (although not in a significant way) because of the presence
of the species as can be seen in Figure 4b, which modifies the way this ion interacts
with the surface of the biomass; therefore, for this research, the
optimum pH to perform the adsorption tests of this ion is 5.

Figure 5 Effect of pH
on (a) Ni(II) and (b) Cr(III) bioadsorption on biomass
of D. antarctica. QpH corresponds to the adsorption capacity of metals at
different pH for an equilibrium time of 7 h.

The progressive increase in the adsorption capacity at acidic pH
is associated with the surface charge of the biosorbent. At low pH
there is a high positive charge density because of the high concentration
of protons on the surface. This produces a high electrostatic repulsion
during the adsorption of the metal ions, decreasing the adsorption
capacity of these pollutants. By increasing the pH the electrostatic
repulsion decreases because of the reduction of the positive charge
density at the sorption sites, this can improve the adsorption of
metal ions.36 This effect was observed
in the two metal ions studied because they have similar physicochemical
properties such as low electronegativity, close ionic radio, and positive
electronic charge.

In this work, simple and competitive adsorption
tests were performed
on the ions; therefore, the subsequent adsorption tests were performed
at a pH of 5 for both compounds [Ni(II) and Cr(III)], in order to
obtain comparative results.

3.3 Determination of the Equilibrium
Time for
the Bioadsorption of Ni(II) and Cr(III)
Figure 6a shows the progress of the
Ni(II) adsorption process on the surface of D. antarctica as a function of time; as expected, as the time elapses, Qt increases until 120 min. Qt obtained for the times of
120 and 240 min are significantly different, indicating that the adsorption
equilibrium is reached at a time of 120 min and then a desorption
process occurrs. Figure 6b shows the change of Qt for the Cr(III) ion as a function of time, in the first 240 minutes
it is fast, subsequently it could be observed that the retention process
continued but to a much lesser extent until 420 min; therefore, the
subsequent experiments of adsorption of the Cr(III) and Cr(VI) ion
were carried out for further 420 min.14

Figure 6 Determination
of the equilibrium time of bioadsorption of (a) Ni(II)
and (b) Cr(III) on the surface of D. antarctica. Qt corresponds to
the adsorption capacity of metals at different times 5, 10, 30, 60,
120, 240, and 420 min at optimum pH.

3.4 Bioadsorption Isotherms: Mechanisms and Theoretical
Treatment of Data
The starting and postbiosorption biomass
were analyzed using FTIR, SEM, and immersion calorimetry in order
to correlate the changes observed in the biomass and the possible
mechanism by the biosorption process like it is discussed below.

3.4.1 FTIR Analysis
The starting and
postbiosorption solids were analyzed using FTIR (Figure 7). The biomass spectrum before
the biosorption process presented six predominant peaks, at 3510 cm–1 attributed to stretching vibrations of −OH
and −NH groups, 2930 and 1335 cm–1 attributed
to stretching and bending of methyl groups (−CH3), respectively. 1642 cm–1 attributed to stretching
vibrations of −COOH groups, 1264 cm–1 attributed
to stretching vibrations of the −C–O–C bonds
and finally at 1053 cm–1 attributed to stretching
vibrations of the bonds −C–O of alcoholic groups. The
spectrum of the exhausted biomass (after the biosorption process)
revealed a few changes in the intensities and frequencies of some
peaks; this can suggest that these functional groups are involved
in the interactions and mechanism of adsorption. For example, the
peak at 3510 cm–1 shifted to lower frequencies in
both cases (Ni(II) and Cr(III) biosorption), suggesting that −OH
and −NH groups are involved in ion metal uptakes.37

Figure 7 IR spectra of the biomass before and after the biosorption
process
of Ni(II) and Cr(III) on the surface.

3.4.2 SEM Analysis
The starting and postbiosorption
solids were analyzed by SEM–EDX (energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy)
with this technique high-resolution black and white images were obtained
that make it possible to study the morphology and also the elemental
analysis of the surface before and after the biosorption process.
The SEM micrographs in Figure 8a–c show the images obtained for the raw solid, which
has an irregular and rough surface with some cavities that provide
the surface area for interaction with ions in solution. In contrast,
SEM micrographs in Figure 8d–f,g–i show the Ni(II) and Cr(III) exhausted
biomass, respectively, with considerable differences in the raw solid
morphology, and it is possible to observe homogenous open cavities
with a diameter of around 20 μm. The change in the structure
indicates that ions could interact with the surface and produce the
opening of the cavities.37

metal ions studied at different magnification (a) 150×, (b) 500×,
and (c) 1000×; SEM images after the Cr(III) biosorption process

The changes on elemental composition can be evaluated
by the EDX
spectrum, and the biosorption process of chromium in the surface of
this material can be evidenced given that in the analysis area there
is a chromium percentage of 20.07%; in contrast, the EDX analysis
of the algae micrograph submitted to the nickel biosorption process
shows a percentage of 26.70%. The EDX was performed at the same magnification
of the image of the biomass area.

3.4.3 Immersion
Calorimetric Experiments
To study and understanding of biosorption
process in a liquid–solid
as in the case study interface one must know the texture and chemical
properties of the adsorbent, it is also necessary to know how the
solid behaves in a liquid medium considering that some changes may
occur when the adsorbent is immersed in a pure liquid or a solution.
For this reason, it is necessary to use special methods that provide
direct information on the liquid–solid particular interactions;
immersion microcalorimetry has been used for this purpose. The parameter
that is evaluated by immersion microcalorimetry is the immersion enthalpy
(ΔHimm). The enthalpy change describes
the exchange of heat that occurs in every physical or chemical process;
therefore, it is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that describes
the amount of heat released or absorbed during the course of the study
process. Specifically in the adsorption process the enthalpy represents
the total energy change in the whole process, which includes different
stages related to the heat of wetting, the energy necessary for the
desolvation of the sites, and the energy change after adsorbate bonding.

Figure 9 shows the
comparison of the calorimetry peaks generated by immersing an inorganic
solid such as granular activated carbon in benzene and biomass in
a chromium solution of 300 mg L–1. For granular
carbon, a large peak originates and the equilibrium is reached again
around 300 s, while the biomass releases less heat when it interacts
with the chromium solution and the equilibrium is acheived after approximately
2100 s, this has been attributed to its chemical properties of a natural
biosorbent, as is its increase in size when absorbing a liquid.

Table 2 summarizes
the results obtained from immersion calorimetry in water and in chromium
and nickel solutions, the concentrations correspond to the highest
concentration studied in the biosorption isotherms.

Different Liquids

water	–30.11	
Cr(III) 300 mg L–1 solution	–77.72	
Ni(II) 300 mg L–1 solution	–58.48	
The results obtained and summarized
in the previous table show
that:(i) Immersion enthalpy in water is indicative
of the surface chemistry; thus a greater amount of surface-oxygenated
groups produces an increase in immersion enthalpy because of the established
of interaction between the water molecule and such groups—which
according to the chemical characterization are mostly acid type and
interaction with Lewis basic sites, corresponding mainly to the delocalized
π electrons aromatic structures.19,38

(ii) There is an increasing trend in enthalpy
values for the chromium solution compared to nickel; this result is
the evidence of selectivity and affinity mechanisms through the establishment
of different adsorption mechanisms, such as donor–acceptor
interactions.19,38



3.4.4 Adsorption Models
The experimental
data of Qe and Ce were adjusted to the different models mentioned in Section 2.5 to understand
the types of interactions and the mechanism of adsorption of metal
ions on the surface of the biosorbent. In Figure 10 a,b, the biosorption isotherms of Ni(II)
and Cr(III), respectively are observed. In these graphs the final
concentration in the balance of the ions is related to the capacity
of D. antarctica to adsorb these contaminants
on its surface. The discussion of these results is done below.

Figure 10 (a) Ni(II)
bioadsorption experimental data adjusted to models,
at a pH of 5 and a time of 240 min. (b) Cr(III) bioadsorption experimental
data adjusted to models, at a pH of 5, a time of 120 min.

Figure 10 a,b shows
the experimental isotherm data adjusted to Freundlich, Langmuir, Redlich–Peterson,
Sips, and Toth models. The adjustment parameters of the models were
calculated using the Rosenbrock and quasi-Newton optimization method
included in STATISTICA software. Table 3 summarizes the obtained parameters and coefficients
of determination of the biosorption data by applying the models.

According to the correlation factors
(R2) of the models to metal ion adsorption
the best adjustments are
observed following the order below:

Ni(II): Sips > Redlich–Peterson
= Toth > Langmuir > Freundlich

Cr(III): Sips > Redlich–Peterson
> Toth > Langmuir > Freundlich.

Among two-parameter
models, the Langmuir model better described
the isotherm data with higher R2 than
the Freundlich model. The Freundlich model assumes that adsorption
occurs on a heterogeneous surface and in layers with different energy,21 the parameters Kf and nf had higher values for the Chromium
isotherm as it indicated a desirable high affinity. However, the lowest
correlation factors, R2, 0.941 and 0.871
were obtained in this model for the bioadsorption of Ni(II) and Cr(III),
respectively, indicating that the adsorption sites have a low degree
of heterogeneity.

From the Langmuir model it is possible to
estimate the maximum
metal uptake values; these were 51.3 and 100.2 mg g–1 for Ni(II) and Cr(III), respectively. The capacity of adsorption
can be affected by the physicochemical characteristics of the ions
in this case a higher density of positive charge and lower ionic radius
of chromium (0.69 Å) favors the adsorption on an ion such as
nickel with an ionic radius of 0.78 Å. The coefficient related
to the affinity between the biosorbents and the ion (K) is also studied
the in Langmuir model, for K high values indicate a high affinity
for the biosorbents and the ion metal and show a steep initial slope
in the isotherm plot, as in the case of the chromium isotherm.22

The three-parameter models, Sips, Redlich–Peterson,
and
Toth describe better the experimental data of adsorption obtained
for both pollutants; these models involve characteristics of the Langmuir
and Freundlich models. The higher R2 values
for the three-parameter isotherms suggest the applicability of these
models to represent the equilibrium sorption of ion metals by biomass
from the algae D. antartica. In Table 4 it is observed that
the Sips model has the best fit to the Ni(II) and Cr(III) bioadsorption
data. The R2 obtained for this model was
0.955 and 0.984 for Ni(II) and Cr(III), respectively. This model is
based on the assumption that each adsorption site interacts with a
single molecule or ion of the adsorbate.39 It is also known that this model adjusts to low and high concentrations
of metal ions where the interactions of the metal with the adsorbent
are different and as their concentration decreases the interaction
with the surface of the biomass also decreases. Indicating that the
bioadsorption on the surface of the algae D. antarctica occurs in the interaction sites distributed heterogeneously. The ns parameter of the Sips model obtained with
the Ni(II) adsorption data is 0.505 and 0.651 for Cr(III) isotherm
because this mean value is between zero and one, and it can be said
that the degree of homogeneity/heterogeneity of the adsorption sites
describes a greater concentration of groups superficial with the same
capacity of adsorption in terms of energy.

3.5 Competitive Adsorption
The competitive
adsorption of metal ions in solution is determined by the affinity
of the ions for the surface and the physicochemical nature of the
adsorbent solid; therefore, the effectiveness of the process is related
to the adsorption mechanism of each of them. When two adsorbates compete
for the same adsorption site, it is usually observed that the adsorption
of the adsorbate that has a greater affinity for the same solid in
simple adsorption is favored.40,41 In the case that the
adsorbates do not interact with the same adsorption site it is possible
that the removal capacity is not affected with respect to the simple
systems of each adsorbate.42

Next,
the effect of a competitive ion is evaluated, in Figure 11a the results obtained when
performing the competitive adsorption tests between Ni(II) and Cr(III)
are presented. This figure shows the effect on the Qe of chromium on the algae D. antarctica as the concentration of Ni(II) increases. At low concentrations
of Ni(II) the Qe of this ion is low and
there is a high adsorption of Cr(III), as the concentration of Ni(II)
increases, the Qe of Cr(III) decreases
and increases the Qe of Ni(II). Considering
that the interaction of the functional groups of D.
antarctica is influenced by the concentration of the
metal ions present in the aqueous solution. As noted above, the adsorption
behavior of the cations of these metals on D. antarctica is not similar because of the differences in their physicochemical
properties, such as electronegativity, ionic radio, and electronic
charge. The Sips model presents the best fit to the data obtained
in nickel competitive adsorption, the R2 value when applying this model was 0.971.

Figure 11 (a) Competitive adsorption
between Ni(II) and Cr(III) at a pH of
5 and a time of 420 min (b) competitive adsorption between Ni(II)
and Cr(VI) at a pH of 5 and a time of 420 min. For both isotherms
the concentration of Ni (II) was in the range between 7.5 and 300
ppm, while the concentration of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) remained constant
at a value of 100 ppm.

Figure 11b shows
the results of the competitive adsorption between Ni(II) and Cr(VI).
In this experiment, it was found that the adsorption of nickel is
favored by the presence of the Cr(VI) ion because the Qe value of Ni(II) in this experiment is greater than the
value obtained in the simple adsorption. On the other hand, the Qi of Cr(VI) reached small values even when the
initial concentration of Ni(II) was below 7.5 ppm and decreased as
the concentration of Ni(II) increased to 300 ppm (Figure 11b). The interactions of the
functional groups present on the surface of the algae D. antarctica with the metal ions favor the adsorption
of the Ni2+ ion. The Sips model presents the best fit to
the data obtained from Ni(II) adsorption, with a R2 value of 0.997.

For all the isotherms, it is observed
that when the initial concentration
of the ion increases between 7.5 and 300 mg L–1 the
capacity of adsorption increases because of the progressive occupation
of the adsorption sites until the complete saturation of the adsorbent.
According to the above observation, it can be concluded that dynamic
equilibrium are influenced by the initial concentration. This behavior
is explained by the increase in the driving force of the concentration
gradient.43

The Sips model presented
the best fit to the data obtained in the
simple adsorption of Ni(II) and Cr(III) and in the competitive adsorption
of the Ni(II) ion with Cr(III) and/or Cr(VI). The model of this isotherm
incorporates the characteristics of Langmuir and Freundlich models.
At low concentrations, the Sips model is reduced to the Freundlich
isotherm, indicating that the adsorption of Ni(II) on the surface
of D. antarctica was heterogeneous,
while, at higher concentrations, this model predicts adsorption in
the monolayer characteristic of the Langmuir isotherm.44 This model is valid when working at low and
high concentrations of Ni(II).

3.6 Mechanisms
of Bioadsorption
As mention
above, the cell wall of brown algae is majorly composed of cellulose–hemicellulose
and alginic acids in polymers structures which interact with alkali
and alkali-terreous ions and other polysaccharides such as fucoidans
and phlorotannins. Figure 12 illustrates the biosorption of Ni(II), Cr(III), and Cr(VI)
metal ions which involve different mechanisms including: electrostatic
attraction, cation exchange, formation of superficial metal complexes
and hydrogen bond with alginates and phlorotannins, and microprecipitation.5,29,30

Figure 12 Schematic illustration of the main biosorption
mechanism of Ni(II),
Cr(III), and Cr(VI).

In general, it can be
said that the Ni(II), Cr(III), and Cr(VI)
adsorption data obtained experimentally in the present study show
a good agreement with the data found in the literature (Table 4).

4 Conclusions
In this work, it was found that D. antarctica is an excellent biosorbent of Ni(II) and Cr(III). It was determined
that the optimal conditions for carrying out the adsorption of metals
is given at a pH of 5 and at a time of 240 and 420 min for Ni(II)
and Cr(III), respectively. Under these conditions, the Qe value for Ni(II) and Cr(III) was 32.85 and 102.7 mg
g–1, respectively.

The change in the adsorption
of ions in competitive systems showed
that both Ni(II) and Cr(III) compete for the same adsorption sites
on the surface of D. antarctica; although
the physicochemical properties of Ni(II) and Cr(III) are similar,
the adsorption of the ions favors the increase of its concentration
and a lower ionic radius, while the Ni(II) and Cr(VI) ions present
significant differences in their physicochemical properties, favoring
the adsorption of Ni(II) independent of its concentration.
