Palladium(II) and platinum(II) complexes
bearing N-heterocyclic
carbenes derived from guanosine are synthesized via oxidative addition,
followed by protonation in the presence of acid. Cytotoxicity of the
compounds is evaluated in several cell lines. Compounds 2a, 2b, and 3a are selective for glioblastoma
U251 cells and are nontoxic toward healthy human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cells.

Introduction
N-heterocyclic carbenes1 (NHCs) are
widely used as ligands for transition metals, with extensive applications
in catalysis2 and medicinal chemistry.3 Nucleobases and their alkylated adducts are NHC
precursors, and their ability to form ylides4−7 has enabled their use as biomarkers
in certain types of cancer.8 Notably, only
a few examples of NHCs stabilized by transition metals derived from
nucleobases have been described.9−16 For purines, NHC formation employs oxidative addition of the corresponding
halogenated nucleobases9−11 or cyclometalation supported by a chelating unit
tether.9 However, these procedures are
restricted to unnatural adducts of adenine and to caffeine and have
not been extended to nucleosides. The difficulty of doing so relies
mostly on finding a suitable protection/deprotection methodology.
While this is a common practice in nucleoside chemistry,6,10 it cannot be easily transferred to metallated nucleosides. This
is due to the harsh conditions employed for deprotection, which compromise
the integrity of the compounds in two fundamental ways: the stability
of the M–C bond and of the glycosidic bond.11

The use of nucleobase derivatives as therapeutic
agents suggests
that the combination with a metal complex may provide a wide array
of pharmaceutical applications, particularly when bound to the metal
center as NHC. Metal–NHC systems have been employed as anticancer
agents, and one of the main challenges at present is to develop compounds
capable of targeting cancerous cells while being nontoxic to healthy
ones.12 For instance, cisplatin is used
in more than 50% treatments of cancer patients13,14 but it presents major drawbacks, such as poor selectivity,
intrinsic or acquired resistance,15 and
severe side effects.14 A suitable approach
to overcome this problem is to increase selectivity by utilizing ligands
derived from biomolecules that are able to induce selectivity by molecular
recognition. As such, complexes that contain tailor-made ligands forming
metal bioconjugates could facilitate targeting cancerous cells and
achieve a higher selectivity. For purines, coordination to a metal
as NHC via C-8 (Scheme 1) provides a connectivity that enables base-pairing interactions,
as all sites involved in Watson–Crick base pairing remain intact.
This feature constitutes an excellent tool for the development of
metal complexes capable of performing targeted molecular recognition.16−18 With this feature in mind, we considered the development of novel
metallo-anticancer agents based on NHCs derived from nucleobases.
Herein, we report the synthesis of palladium(II) and platinum(II)
NHC complexes based on guanosine. These represent the first examples
of deprotected nucleoside NHC complexes that enable base-pairing recognition.
As a preliminary evaluation of their antiproliferative ability, we
examine their cytotoxic activity against four human cell lines, namely,
HEK293, HeLa, PC3, and U251 cells.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Guanosine Complexes 1–3 and Numbering Scheme for Purine Nucleobases
Results and Discussion
The synthesis employs oxidative addition of brominated nucleosides
to platinum(0) and palladium(0). Accordingly, the reaction of 2′,3′,5′-triacetyl-8-bromoguanosine19 (I) with M(PPh3)4 in refluxing toluene (M = Pd, Pt) affords the corresponding
guanosine complexes 1a and 1b in good yields
(Scheme 1). Protection
of the hydroxyl groups is required, as the reaction with unprotected
8-bromo-guanosine leads to a mixture of compounds. Complexes 1a and 1b can be protonated under acidic conditions
at room temperature, affording the corresponding protic NHCs 2a and 2b. For 2a, protonation is
induced in methanolic solutions of 1a with aqueous HBF4. Earlier attempts to synthesize the corresponding platinum
compound from 1b using HBF4 were unsuccessful.
Thus, compound 2b was synthesized using ethanolic solutions
of HCl. The synthesis of the BF4 (2b-BF4) derivative can also be achieved using ethanolic
solutions of aqueous HBF4 but in moderate yields. Under
acidic conditions similar to those of deprotection but for longer
reaction times, compounds 1a and 1b undergo
deprotection of the hydroxyl groups of the ribose. This deprotection
methodology induces concomitant protonation of the nitrogen atom N7
of the guanosine ligand, affording in one step the formation of the
protic and deprotected NHCs 3a and 3b. Notably,
this process does not affect the integrity of the M–C bond.
Complexes 1–3 are stable under air
and moisture for prolonged periods of time. When a solution of 1b in CDCl3 was kept under air for several weeks,
no decomposition was observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Complexes 1–3 were characterized by NMR spectroscopy
in dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO-d6). As a general trend, in the 1H
spectra, the H1′ doublet of the ribose ring undergoes a downfield
shift of 0.4–0.9 ppm, with respect to I, for all
complexes. For compounds 2 and 3, the N7–H
resonates at around 13 ppm, irrespectively of the nature of metal,
while the singlet corresponding to the N1–H undergoes an upfield
shift of ca. 1 ppm upon protonation. In the 13C{1H} NMR spectra, the ribose ring gives rise to five resonances between
δ 60 and 90 ppm for all compounds. For complexes 1, the metallated C-8 is observed at δ 150.2 (1a) and 139.9 ppm (1b). Upon protonation, the ylidene
derivatives 2 and 3 show some differences
in 13C{1H} NMR spectra, specifically a downfield
shift of C-8, (cf. δ 166.9 ppm (2a); δ is
153.0 ppm (2b)). The 31P{1H} NMR
spectra present two singlets20 at around
21–22.00 ppm for palladium complexes and 17–19.00 for
platinum complexes. For compounds 1b, 2b, and 3, the 31P{1H} spectra show
the presence of a minor compound (presumably the enol-tautomer) that
we were unable to identify. In 1H NMR, the signals are
mostly overlapped (e.g., 2b) or not detected (1b), whereas for 13C{1H}, the minor product is
not observed. For 1b, the ratio between the minor and
the major compound varies when changing from CD2Cl2 to DMSO-d6, further supporting
the presence of a tautomeric form of the ligand. Of note, all compounds
were characterized by microanalysis to further confirm their purity.
Guanine derivatives can aggregate via base-pairing. As an example,
aggregation of compound 1a was monitored by 1H NMR, evidencing that the NH and the NH2 groups undergo
a slight high-field shift (Supporting Information, SI) upon dilution. Aggregation measurements for these complexes
are currently being carried out via NMR and will be reported in due
course.

Crystals of 2a were obtained by slow evaporation
of
a saturated chloroform solution, allowing their characterization by
single-crystal X-ray analysis (Figure 1). The crystal structure indicates a trans-orientation
for the two phosphines. The Pd–C-8 bond length is 1.981(8)
Å, which correlates well with related N-heterocyclic carbene
compounds of palladium.21,22 The sugar adopts a
puckered conformation, with the C2 turned out of the plane formed
by C1′–O4′–C4′ by 109.8(5)°,
following the trend found for purine nucleosides with bulky substituents
at the C-8 (C2′ endo).23−26 The torsion angle around the glycosidic bond (χ,
defined by O4′–C1′–N9–C4) is 77.5(9)°,
corresponding to a synclinal orientation.24,27 It reflects a distortion of the ring to accommodate the acetate
groups and minimize steric crowding imposed by the phosphines.

of the cation of complex 2a (nonrelevant
H atoms, solvent molecules and counter ion BF4 are omitted
for clarity, 50% probability ellipsoids).

The cytotoxicity of the compounds, including the ligand precursor I, was tested at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 80
μM in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, prostate cancer
(PC3) cells, cervical cancer (HeLa) cells, and glioblastoma (U251)
cells for 48 h. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the ability of cells
to metabolize 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT), as described elsewhere.28 Accordingly, healthy human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293, were
not sensitive to any of the compounds (cf. SI). For cancerous cell lines PC3 and HeLa, compounds 1–3 showed no significant antiproliferative activity.
By contrast, glioblastoma U251 cells revealed sensitivity to compounds 2a, 2b, and 3a (Figure 2). Palladium NHC compounds 2a and 3a show a higher antiproliferative activity
than their corresponding platinum derivative 2b.

Figure 2 Viability of
U251 cells after incubation with compounds 2a,b and 3a,b for 48 h, assessed
by evaluating their ability to metabolize MTT.

These compounds induce a significant antiproliferative activity
when compared with cisplatin for glioblastoma U251. The antiproliferative
activity of compound 1a presents a large variability
between experiments and thus is not found statistically significant.
This is probably a result of its low solubility, as 1a precipitates at higher concentrations upon addition to liquid cell
culture medium. In contrast, the measurements for 2a and 3a are consistent between experiments. For example, the antiproliferative
activity of compound 3a reaches ca. 50% for a range of
concentrations between 20 and 80 μM. For platinum complexes,
the higher cytotoxic activity is observed for compound 2b, the acetate-protected platinum NHC. Compound 2b induces
a significant decrease in cancer cell growth at a concentration as
low as 0.1 μM, but in general, the maximum percentage of decrease
was less significant than that of compounds 2a and 3a. The ligand precursor I, the brominated and
protected guanosine, does not show antiproliferative activity.

Conclusions
In summary, we have disclosed a new methodology for the synthesis
of N-heterocyclic carbenes derived from guanosine with palladium(II)
and platinum(II) precursors. For the reaction to be effective, the
guanosine derivative requires protection of its hydroxyl groups with
acetate. This constitutes the first example of a purine NHC derived
from a nucleoside. The deprotected NHC can subsequently be obtained
under acidic conditions. Antiproliferative measurements with a number
of cell lines show that the compounds are nontoxic for healthy cells
HEK293. Compounds 2a, 2b, and 3a are active cytotoxic agents for glioblastoma cell line U251 and
show a significant antiproliferative activity when compared with cisplatin.
These are promising results, as glioblastoma multiform is a very aggressive
form of brain cancer in adults.29 Studies
on other glioblastoma cell lines and examination of the mechanism
of action of these compounds are currently being pursued.
