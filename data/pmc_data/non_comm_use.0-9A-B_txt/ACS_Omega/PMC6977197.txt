Polymer composites with excellent thermal conductivity
and superior
mechanical strength are in high demand in the electrical engineering
systems. However, achieving superior thermal conductivity and mechanical
properties simultaneously at high loading of fillers will still be
a challenging issue. In this work, a facile method was proposed to
prepare the epoxy composite with carbon fibers (CFs) and alumina (Al2O3). This CF and Al2O3 hybrid
structure can effectively reduce the interfacial thermal resistance
between the matrix and the CFs. The thermal conductivity of epoxy
composite with 6.4 wt % CFs and 74 wt % Al2O3 hybrid filler reaches 3.84 W/(m K), which is increasing by 2096%
compared with that of pure epoxy. Meanwhile, the epoxy composite still
retains outstanding thermal stability and mechanical performance at
high filler loading. A cost-effective avenue to prepare highly thermally
conductive and superior mechanical properties of polymer-based composites
may enable some prospective application in advanced thermal management.

Introduction
Many significant electronic applications
require effective heat
dissipation, especially for electronic devices such as integrated
circuits and light-emitting devices (LEDs), as overheating always
causes rapid aging or even failure of the core chip.1−4 Polymer-based thermal management material is widely accepted as
a high-performance material in many fields for its easy processability,
excellent chemical properties, and low cost, but its low thermal conductivity
is still a major drawback and limits its applications.5,6 Many methods have been developed to improve its performance. Traditionally,
it is reported that a variety of thermally conductive fillers including
metal nanoparticles (e.g., Ag),7 metal
oxides (e.g., Al2O3, MgO),8,9 nitrides
(e.g., AlN, BN),10,11 and most recently graphene12 and carbon nanotubes (CNTs)13 can be usually included in the polymer matrix.

Among
them, alumina (Al2O3) has received
considerable attention due to its remarkable physical properties,
such as high thermal conductivity (30 W/(m K)), abrasion resistance,
corrosion resistance, thermal stability, and electrical insulation,
as well as its low cost.14 Thus, epoxy
resin modified by Al2O3 filler-containing composites
is considered as a promising method for improving thermal conductivity.15 However, researchers are focused on adding above
80 wt % loading of Al2O3 filler to obtain high
thermally conductive composites by the traditional blend method,16,17 yet leading to significant degradation of mechanical strength and
processability.18 Therefore, the researchers
are urged to find facile and novel approaches to prepare composites
with both high thermal conductivity and excellent mechanical properties.

In recent years, two kinds of methods have been adopted to obtain
superior thermal conductivity as well as excellent mechanical strength.
In the first method, the functionalization of filler surface by surfactants
and coupling agents19−23 for reducing the interfacial thermal resistance between the thermally
conductive filler and the polymer matrix.24,25 Nevertheless, the effect of thermal conductivity enhancement (TCE)
reported above is limited compared without functionalization.26,27 The second is based on constructing a continuous filler architecture
that can provide thermal transport channels. This network yield high
thermal conductivity at a relatively low filler loading. For example,
a compact packing structure of filler particles can be formed by combining
different particle sizes of spherical Al2O3 at
different mass ratios,28 which slightly
increases the thermal conductivity. The porous Al2O3 ceramic skeletons are constructed by a new processing technique
including the gel casting, sintering, and vacuum infiltration methods.29 This structure can dramatically improve the
heat transport of the composites. But it should be noted that the
entire fabrication process is very complicated and not suitable for
industrial mass production.

Herein, an epoxy resin-based composite
with thermal transport expressways
is prepared by incorporating carbon fiber (CF) foams and Al2O3 particles. The CF foams are used as the premade template
to connect the neighboring spherical Al2O3 particles,
which provides the coherent thermal transport channels for CFs. A
hybrid network structure composed of Al2O3 and
CFs provides prolonged pathways similar to heat dissipation highways
in epoxy composites and shows a much higher thermal conductivity
(3.84 W/(m K)) at the loading of 74 wt % Al2O3 than that of pure epoxy (0.18 W/(m K)), which may find a potential
application for thermal management of electronic devices. Furthermore,
our composites present more outstanding thermal stability and excellent
mechanical strength compared to pure epoxy.

Results and Discussion
The preparation process of the
epoxy/CF/Al2O3 (ECA) composites is shown in Figure 1. First, the CF foams
were mixed with Al2O3 aqueous solution and dried
to obtain CF foam and Al2O3 particles (CA) hybrid
fillers. The amount of
Al2O3 in the CA mixture block could be controlled
by adjusting the concentration of Al2O3 in the
solution (as shown in Table S1). Then,
the epoxy precursor was infiltrated into the CA mixture block and
degassed under vacuum. Finally, the resulted mixture was precured
and postcured to obtain the ECA composites with different Al2O3 ratios.

and the tailored works of the logotype of Ningbo Institute of Industrial
Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CNITECH) with samples.

As can be seen in Figure 2, the morphologies and chemical compositions
of Al2O3, carbon fiber, epoxy resin, and the
cross-sectional
of our epoxy/CF composites with different ratios of Al2O3 were characterized by using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), ZETA, and Raman spectroscopy. The average diameter of Al2O3 particles is about 5 μm as shown in the
inset of Figure 2a.
Raman spectrum that exhibits two Raman shifts at 1354 cm–1 (D-band) and 1583 cm–1 (G-band) in the inset of Figure 2b demonstrates that
the main component of the foam is carbon fiber30 (the spectral range is scanning from 1000 to 3200 cm–1). The D-band intensity (ID) and the G-band intensity (IG) of carbon
fiber correspond to the defect-inducing vibration mode and in-plane
vibrations of graphite lattice, respectively.31−33Figure 2c shows the microstructure
of pure epoxy after curing. Note that the fractured paths of river
line patterns at the fracture surface indicate a brittle fracture. Figure 2d–i present
the cross-sectional SEM image morphologies of ECA composites with
different ratios of Al2O3. From Figure 2d, we can see the carbon fiber
at the epoxy resin matrix interface. The SEM images shown in Figure 2e–i reveal
that the Al2O3 particles and CFs have good contact
with epoxy resin and this microstructure can increase the strength
of ECA composites greatly. As the Al2O3 content
increasing, more Al2O3 balls appeared on the
fracture surface. Figure 2j shows the SEM image of the composite with 74 wt % Al2O3 along with the corresponding energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS) elemental mappings of carbon (C), oxygen (O) and
aluminum (Al). It further illustrates that the Al2O3 balls are gradually and closely distributed in the ECA composites.

The thermal conductivity of the polymer composites
is often determined
by factors such as the interaction between thermal filler and matrix,
the loading of filler, the structure and properties of filler and
matrix, and so on.16 The thermal conductivity
of the ECA composites was evaluated by using a laser flash method. Figure 3a shows the difference
in thermal diffusivity (TD) and thermal conductivity (TC) of epoxy/CF/Al2O3 composites. The TC of pure epoxy resin is only
0.18 W/(m K) at 25 °C. After adding CFs, the TC was significantly
improved up to 1.48 W/(m K). In particular, when Al2O3 was added in epoxy/CF composites, the TC of the ECA composites
was improved even higher and increased monotonically with the incorporation
of the Al2O3 fillers. As the increase in the
loading levels of Al2O3 from 12 to 74 wt %,
the TC increased almost linearly from 1.97 to 3.84 W/(m K). Similarly,
the curve of the TD of composites also shows the same change trend.
Herein, the thermal conductivity enhancement (TCE) is defined as (λ
– λm)/λ, where λ and λm are the thermal conductivity of composites with addition
to fillers and the thermal conductivity of pure epoxy, respectively.34Figure 3b compares the TC and TCE of the epoxy/CF composite, the ECA
composite with 74 wt % Al2O3 filler loading
(ECA-74) and the pure epoxy at 25 °C. These values were more
than 7 and 20 times of the pure resin, respectively. Furthermore,
it is remarkable that the TC of composites prepared with two kinds
of fillers, carbon fiber, and Al2O3, presented
more improvement than that prepared with the individual filler, carbon
fiber. The results may be attributed to three reasons. First, even
a very small loading of carbon-based thermal fillers can dramatically
increase the TC of composites because of their high intrinsic TC.16,35 Thermal transport through epoxy/CF composites is dominated by thermal
resistance at the interface.36−38 The resistance results principally
from interfacial defects and from phonon scattering caused by phonon
spectra mismatch in two phases (fiber and matrix).39 Second, at lower Al2O3 filler loading
levels (<20 wt %), a slight increase of the TC was observed.
Only at high Al2O3 loading levels, a more significant
improvement can be observed. It is reported that the high filler content
with above 60–70 vol % can lead to continuous thermal conduction
paths of fillers in the polymer composite.16,40 This implies that effectively thermal conductive pathways begin
to form at high Al2O3 loading levels due to
filler-to-filler connections, as observed in Figure 2e–i. Simultaneously, the CFs dispersed
in epoxy, effectively connect with Al2O3 particles
and form a dense thermal conductive network throughout the material.
These connections reduce the chance of contact between CFs and the
surrounding matrix, resulting in a decrease in their interfacial thermal
resistance. As a result, an enhanced hybrid network composed of Al2O3 and CFs provides prolonged pathways similar
to heat dissipation highways and shows a much higher thermal conductivity
at the loading of 74 wt % Al2O3 than that of
pure epoxy and epoxy/CF composites. Figure 3c presents the variation in TC of pure epoxy,
epoxy composites at room temperature, and other possible operating
ambient temperatures. The TC curves of pure epoxy, epoxy composites
revealed a trend of monotonically increasing with temperature over
the temperature range investigated. It is aligned with the general
trend for some highly disordered dielectric materials. The increase
in TC with the temperature, indicate that the temperature improves
the interfacial bonding between the fillers and the polymer matrix. Figure 3d shows the variation
in TC of pure epoxy. The EC composite and ECA-74 composite upon multiple
heating and cooling cycles alternating in the range of 25 and 100
°C. The trend of TC of pure epoxy, epoxy composites with temperature
is consistent with Figure 3c. Both EC composite and ECA composite maintained their stable
and original thermal conductivities during the first 10 cycles, demonstrating
stable heat dissipation capacity after multiple treatments.

(d) thermal conductivity of heating/cooling cycles alternating between
25 and 100 °C.

To intuitively display the heat dissipation performance
of epoxy
composites, an infrared camera was used to record the surface temperature
distribution and variation, which can characterize their heat dissipation
performances. The samples were investigated by placing on a ceramic
heating plate to study their thermal behavior. We used the electrified
heating plate as the heat source and fixed the samples on the plate
with conductive tape. From the infrared images in Figure 4a, the surface temperature
of each sample was measured and the surface color became brighter
as the temperature increasing, which means the surface temperature
of the sample increases. In particular, the surface heating rate of
the ECA-74 composite was faster than that of pure epoxy and EC composite.
Quantitatively, the surface temperature of pure epoxy, EC composite,
and ECA-74 composite were measured as 90, 94, and 102 °C, respectively,
when the temperature rose to 115 °C within 240 s. These results
demonstrate that the ECA-74 composite exhibits a better heating dissipation
performance. Similarly, according to the data measured by the infrared
camera, the curves of surface temperature with time during the heating
and cooling process were made, as shown in Figure 4b. It is obvious that the pure epoxy, EC
composite, and ECA-74 composite reached their highest temperature
at 93, 97, and 104 °C, respectively. Besides, ECA-74 presented
much faster heating and cooling rates compared with other samples.
In summary, the ECA-74 composite shows better heating and cooling
behaviors than the pure epoxy and the EC composite. As is evident
in Figure 4c, an experiment
was conducted

epoxy/CF/Al2O3 composites; (b) surface temperature

variation with time on pure epoxy and epoxy/CF/Al2O3 composites.

to demonstrate the high thermal conductivity of
the ECA-74 composite.
Both the pure epoxy sample and ECA-74 sample in the same size (10
× 10 × 1.5 mm3) were put on the heater and the
same size of CuSO4 saturated solution was dropped in the
sample center by the same pipette gun. As the temperature of heater
increasing, the solution placed on the ECA-74 sample quickly changed
from blue droplet to white powder, while that placed on the epoxy
sample only became slightly smaller. It shows that the surface temperature
of ECA-74 increases sharply compared with pure epoxy resin and ECA-74
exhibits high thermal conductivity along with the heat dissipation
performance.

In addition to thermal conductivity, thermal stability
is one of
the most important properties of investigation for the epoxy composites. Figure 5a,b shows the thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) profiles of pure
epoxy resin and its composites as a function of temperature under
air atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, respectively.
For pure epoxy, there was a double-step process for thermally degrading
in the air as shown in the black curve in Figure 5a. It is believed that the main loss with
a maximum rate in the first stage is due to the decomposition of the
epoxy network structure at 370 °C while leaving tiny amounts
of char residue that is further degraded by thermal oxidation at around
420–540 °C in the second stage.41,42 The thermal decomposition curves of epoxy-based composites were
one step more than that of pure epoxy. It is attributed to the oxidative
decomposition reaction of carbon fibers at around 540–900 °C.43 Note that all the samples exhibited similar
thermal behavior except for the additional step of carbon fiber decomposition
reaction, indicating that the presence of fillers do not significantly
change the degradation mechanism of the epoxy matrix. With the increase
in Al2O3 filler content, the second step decomposition
became less obvious, which is attributed to the reduction of epoxy
resin content. The temperature for 10% weight loss (T10%) and the maximum decomposition (Tmax) are selected as the characteristic thermal parameters
and the results are listed in Table S2.
Quantitatively, the T10% of pure epoxy
resin was measured as 331.4 °C, while the T10% of EC composites with 0, 12, 29, 44, 58, and 74 wt % Al2O3 filler were 318.7, 335.4, 331.4, 334.0, 341.7,
and 358.9 °C, respectively. It is obvious that all the ECA composites
exhibited a slight increase in T10% compared
to pure epoxy. Considering the third stage is the carbon fibers decomposition
stage in the air, the carbon residue in the third step degradation
reaction stage (540–1000 °C) is defined as the char yield.
As can be seen that the char yields of all the ECA composites were
improved when compared with that of pure epoxy. Furthermore, it is
observed from Figure 5b that the maximum decomposition temperature (Tmax) of the composites was also mildly increased after adding
thermal filler, compared with that of epoxy resin in DTG curves. It
is considered that the compact chars of the polymer matrix and hybrid
thermal fillers will be formed during the process of thermal decomposition,
which is beneficial for the enhancement of thermal stability for the
composites.44 Meanwhile, the structure
of CFs and Al2O3 increases the crosslinking
between the binding sites of polymer matrix and fillers, thus limiting
the mobility of the polymer segments at the interface of the epoxy
and the thermal motion of the polymer chains.45 Moreover, the stress–strain curves of pure epoxy and its
composites were measured to show their mechanical properties, as shown
in Figure S1. The thermomechanical properties
of ECA composites are shown in Figure 5c,d. The storage modulus, i.e., the amount of energy
stored in the polymer, is associated with the stiffness along with
the dampening capacity of the material.46 All the composite showed a superior storage modulus (E′) than pure epoxy in the glass region, as shown in Figure 5c. Particularly,
the storage modulus of the ECA-44 composite exhibited a significant
increase (8580 MPa at 40 °C) in the glassy region, which was
246.5% larger than that of pure epoxy (2476 MPa), suggesting that
the thermal fillers are uniformly dispersed and have powerful interfacial
adhesion with polymer matrix.47 The storage
modulus fell with the increasing temperature, which indicates that
the energy dissipation occurs in the transition from glass-like to
rubber-like behavior. It is seen that the storage modulus of the composite
materials appeared to be much larger than that of the pure epoxy within
the rubber state. The storage modulus of the composite, for instance,
was about 215% higher than pure epoxy at 100 °C when Al2O3 filler content was 74 wt %. In addition, the loss factor
tan δ is defined as the ratio of loss modulus to storage
modulus, and it is very susceptible to structural transition for the
solid material.48 The peak temperature
of tan δ is selected as the glass transition temperature
(Tg). It is observed from Figure 5d that the Tg values of the epoxy composites reached to higher temperatures
compared with pure epoxy. These results can be attributed to the existing
hybrid thermal fillers in the composite material, which will increase
the obstruction of the segmental motion for the epoxy chains owing
to the effects of interfacial entanglement and interaction.

Conclusions
In summary, an effective heat transport
highway structure was constructed
by the CF-Al2O3 hybrid three-dimensional foams
in epoxy matrix, which can provide coherent bridges composed of spherical
Al2O3 particles and connect dispersed CFs in
an epoxy resin matrix. The epoxy composite has high conductivity (3.84
W/(m K)) with 6.4 wt % CFs and 74 wt % Al2O3 hybrid filler, which is increasing by 2096% compared to that of
pure epoxy, showing great potential for thermal management in electronic
applications. In addition, the composite still retains outstanding
thermal stability and mechanical performance at high filler loading.
Our work reports a new and cost-effective method for preparing highly
thermally conductive and robust heat-conducting polymer-based composites
by designing effective thermal transport channels.

Experimental Section
Materials
Al2O3 powders with
an average diameter of 5 μm were produced from Yaan Bestry Performance
Materials Co., Ltd. (Sichuan, China). The Al2O3 particles were irregular in shape and close to a spherical shape.
Carbon fiber foams were supplied by Vulcan New Material Technology
Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). A cycloaliphatic epoxy resin monomer
(UVR 6105, 95%) was purchased from DOW Chemicals. Neodymium(III) acetylacetonate
trihydrate (Nd(III) acac) (Shanghai D&B Biological Science and
Technology Co., Ltd.) and methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA,
Zhejiang Alpharm Chemtech Co., Ltd.) were used as the catalyst and
curing agent. Deionized water was utilized in all processes of aqueous
solution preparations and washing.

Preparation of Alumina Aqueous Solution
The Al2O3 powder was dispersed into the deionized water
in this experiment. The mass fraction of alumina powder in deionized
water was 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80%, respectively. The resulted solution
was mixed successively at 2500 rpm for 3 min by vacuum deaeration
mixer (TM-310T, Shenzhen Smida Intelligent Equipment Co., Ltd., China).
High-speed stirring can mitigate the agglomeration of Al2O3 clusters and reduce the sedimentation of Al2O3 particles, which is essential to make alumina particles
more easily dispersed into CF foams.

Preparation of Epoxy/CF/Al2O3 (ECA) Composites
The CF foams were further mixed with Al2O3 aqueous solution at 2500 rpm for 3 min, followed by drying at 100
°C for 12 h in the oven to obtain CF foam and Al2O3 particles (CA) hybrid fillers. Then, the desired amount of
Nd(III) acac was added into epoxy monomer (UVR 6105) by a certain
weight ratio (0.1/100), stirred and degassed adequately at 80 °C
for 2 h in a three-necked flask. The uniform solution was cooling
down to room temperature before use. The epoxy precursor was then
obtained by homogeneously mixing the curing agent (MHHPA) and pretreated
epoxy resin (95/100.1). Afterward, the precursor was infiltrated into
the CA mixture block and degassed under vacuum for 24 h. Finally,
the resulted mixture was precured and postcured at 135 °C for
2 h and 165 °C for 14 h, respectively to obtain the epoxy/CF/Al2O3 (ECA) composites.

Characterization
The microscopic morphologies of the
raw materials and the fracture surface of the composites were obtained
with a field-emission scanning electron microscopy instrument (FE-SEM,
Quanta 250) at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. Zetasizer Nano ZS
(ZETA, Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, U.K.) was adapted to estimate
the micrometric sizes of Al2O3 particles. The
heat capacity and the thermal diffusivity of the ECA composites were
respectively measured through the differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC 214) at 10 °C/min heating rate and the LFA 467 Hyper flash
instrument (NETZSCH, Germany) at room temperature. The thermal conductivity
(λ, W/(m K)) of composites was calculated by density (ρ,
g/cm3), heat capacity (Cp,
J/(g K)), and multiplying thermal diffusivity (α, mm2/s) 1  The density (ρ) of samples was determined
by using the Archimedes water (alcohol) displacement method. An infrared
camera (Fluke, Ti400) was used to collect IR images and record the
thermal conductive behavior. The thermal stabilities of pure epoxy
resin and the composites were evaluated through the thermogravimetric
analyzer (TG 209 F3 instrument, NETZSCH, Germany). Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was conducted under air in the range of 50–1000
°C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. A DMA Q800 dynamic mechanical
analyzer (TA Instruments) was used to carry out dynamic mechanical
analysis (DMA) to study the thermomechanical properties of composites.
During the measurement, the samples were tested by carrying out in
the single cantilever mode in a single-frequency pattern at 1.00 Hz
from 25 to 270 °C with a 5 °C/min heating rate.
