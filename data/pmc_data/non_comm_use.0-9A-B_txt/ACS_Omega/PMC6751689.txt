A novel photochromic
diarylethene was synthesized successfully
containing a phthalazine unit. Its multistate fluorescence switching
properties were investigated by stimulating with UV/vis lights and
Al3+/EDTA. The synthesized diarylethene displayed excellent
selectivity to Al3+ with a distinct fluorescence change,
revealing that it could be used as a sensor for fluorescence identification
of Al3+, and a logic circuit was constructed by utilizing
this diarylethene molecular platform. Moreover, it also exhibited
a high accuracy for the determination of Al3+ in practical
water samples.

Introduction
Photochromic compounds
can show two isomers when irradiated with
ultraviolet and visible lights. During the process of reversible photoisomerization,
the physical properties, including refractive index, absorption spectra,
fluorescence, and conjugation, could be adjusted.1,2 They
were widely used in optical storages,3 optical
switches,4−7 optical conversion devices,8,9 solar cells,10,11 sensors,12−14 logic circuits,15−17 and other fields. Among
the reported photochromic compounds, diarylethenes exhibited excellent
advantages including good thermal stability and excellent fatigue
resistance,18−21 and are deemed to be the most potential nominees for practical applications.
Over the past decade, numerous scientific researchers have put in
the efforts to develop diarylethene derivatives for constructing fluorescent
switches and sensors.22−25 A lot of functional units, such as pyridine,26,27 quinoline,28 rhodamine,29 fluorescein,30 and so on, were
introduced to the diarylethene unit to construct multistate systems,
the design and construction of efficient multi-addressable fluorescent
switching systems with diarylethenes has attracted much attention.
Phthalazine is a heterocyclic organic compound with two nitrogen atoms.
It is considered as one of the crucial sensors and chelating agents
for many metal ions, because it could act as the metal-binding group
and fluorophore.31−34 Until now, there was no report on the fluorescent switching of diarylethene
containing the phthalazine unit.

On the other hand, diarylethenes
were also widely researched due
to the application in numerous optoelectronic devices.35−37 Many researchers have applied diarylethenes to construct significant
electronic logic devices of molecular scale, because the electronic
devices are becoming more and more important in our life.38−42 For instance, Tian et al. structured a complex molecular switching,
and its four optical outputs respond to four inputs.43 A multi-addressable terarylene containing benzo[b]thiophene-1,1-dioxide (BTO)
was synthesized by Zhu and colleagues; at the same time, a sequence
of molecular logic gates including 1:2 demultiplexer, half-adder,
and so on were built on the unimolecular platform.44 However, considering the potential applications of logic
gates, there is still a larger space for development to construct
the single-molecule fluorescence switching based on diarylethenes.45−47

Aluminum as the third most widespread (8% by weight) element
in
the biosphere has been widely distributed in natural water and most
biological tissues in the form of Al3+.48,49 Moreover, aluminum is diffusely applied in our daily life such as
light alloys, water purification instruments, household utensils,
and so on.50,51 These factors increase the concentration
of Al3+ in environment and biosome. Nevertheless, high
concentrations of Al3+ are toxic to the human body, flora,
and fauna. Excessive aluminum not only causes severe human health
issues, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease,
and anemia, but also affects the growth of plant roots and aquatic
wildlife.52−55 Consequently, it is particularly important to develop effective
methods to monitor Al3+ in environmental and biological
samples.

To date, multifarious methods for detection of aluminum
ion have
been developed including inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,
atomic absorption spectrometry,56,57 and so on. Except for
these analysis techniques, fluorescent sensors are considered to be
the most suitable method for detecting Al3+, because of
their advantages of high selectively, simplicity, and real-time analysis.58−60 To date, there have been reported many fluorescent sensors to detect
Al3+.61−65 However, these sensors are either interfered with Fe3+, Cd2+, Cr3+, and Zn2+, or the sensitivity
needs to be further improved. Hence, designing a high selective and
sensitive fluorescent sensor for the determination of Al3+ is vitally important.

In the work, we triumphantly designed
and synthesized a new fluorescent
switching of diarylethene containing the phthalazine unit. The diarylethene
derivative could be served as a multicontrolled fluorescent switching
under the stimulation of UV/vis lights and Al3+/EDTA. Simultaneously,
it also could be used as a highly selective sensor for fluorescence
identification Al3+. Moreover, it was also suitable for
constructing logic gate. Scheme 1 displays the photochromism of the diarylethene derivative,
and the structural characterization data of 1o including 1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR spectrum, and electrospray ionization-mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS) are exhibited in Supporting Information (Figures S1–S4).

Scheme 1 Photochromism of 1o
Results and Discussion
The photochromic properties of 1o were performed by
irradiation of UV/vis lights in methanol. According to Figure 1A, two absorption bands centered
at 293 nm (ε = 5.88 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1) and 389 nm (ε = 2.38 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1) were observed,
which were ascribed to 1o. When the solution of 1o was irradiated with 297 nm ultraviolet light, the absorbance
at 293 nm decreased gradually, while two new absorption bands centered
at 363 nm (ε = 3.89 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1) and 594 nm (ε = 2.08 × 104 L mol–1 cm–1) appeared
simultaneously and increased gradually, along with which the colorless
solution turn blue, which may be caused by the C=N isomerization67 and the formation of the closed-ring isomer 1c with a larger π-electron delocalization in the molecule.68 At the photostationary states (PSS), the conversion
from 1o to 1c was 100%, according to the
absorption coefficients in methanol.69 Two
clear isosbestic points were respectively found at 318 and 409 nm,
manifesting a unimolecular process.70 Contrarily,
the absorption spectrum could be restored from 1c to 1o by irradiating visible light (λ > 500 nm), accompanied
by which the blue solution turn colorless. The cycloreversion and
cyclization quantum yields were calculated as 0.012 and 0.21, and
1,2-bis(2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-thienyl)perfluorocyclopentene was used
as standard.71

Figure 1 Changes of
the absorption (A) and fluorescence spectrum (B) of 1o by photoirradiation in methanol (λex =
410 nm).

Then, we investigated systematically
the fluorescence changes of 1o that were induced by UV/vis
lights. As exhibited in Figure 1B, 1o shows a weak emission peak at 613 nm using
410 nm light as the excitation,
and the absolute fluorescence quantum yield was measured as 0.009.
When the solution of 1o was irradiated with a 297 nm
ultraviolet light, the emission intensity of 1o gradually
decreased and was quenched by ca. 86% at the PSS, because the nonfluorescence
isomer 1c was formed, revealing that the diarylethene
has a high fluorescence modulation efficiency. Similarly, the fluorescent
spectrum also could be restored from 1c to 1o by irradiation with a proper wavelength of visible light (λ
> 500 nm).

The interactions between 1o and various
metal ions
(5.0 equiv of 1o) were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy.
As described in Figure 2, the emission intensity at 560 nm enhanced significantly after addition
of Al3+, and an prominent variation in fluorescent color
was observed from black to green, because a new complex 1o-Al3+ (1o′) was generated. After coordinating
with Al3+, the stable complexation was formed, which not
only prohibited the photoinduced electron transfer process from the
hydroxyl group to the diarylethene unit but also inhibited isomerization
of the C=N and increased rigidification of fluorophore structure,
resulting in the chelation-enhanced fluorescence effect.72,73 Moreover, the intramolecular charge transfer effect also exists
in the process, and a 53 nm blue shift was observed from 613 to 560
nm with the addition of Al3+. While the remaining test
ions were added, respectively, the fluorescent intensity of 1o remained unchanged, with the exception of Zn2+. The fluorescent intensity enhanced slightly after adding Zn2+, which was negligible compared with Al3+. The
results revealed that 1o could be used as a highly effective
fluorescence sensor to detect Al3+.

Figure 2 Fluorescence responses
of 1o to various ions (5.0
equiv) in methanol (λex = 410 nm): (A) evolution
of emission spectra; (B) changes of emission intensity; and (C) changes
of fluorescence color (under 365 nm UV-lamp).

The fluorometric titration experiments of 1o and 1c with Al3+ were performed in methanol and are
described in Figure 3. With the increase of Al3+ from 0 to 5.0 equiv, the fluorescence
intensity of 1o at 560 nm gradually enhanced (Figure 3A) and reached saturation
with further titration (Figure S5, Supporting Information). At that time, the emission intensity is 126-fold
higher than that of 1o, and the absolute fluorescence
quantum yield was measured as 0.053. The color of fluorescent turned
green from black, because of the formation of 1o′. The emission intensity of 1c was enhanced 88-fold
when 0 to 5.0 equiv of Al3+ was added, indicating the formation
of 1c′, and the emission intensity remained unchanged
with further addition of Al3+ (Figure 3B). The fluorescence intensity of 1o and 1c could be recovered from 1o′ and 1c′ by adding 10.0 equiv of EDTA, demonstrating
that the complexation–decomplexation reactions of 1o and 1c with Al3+ were reversible, respectively.

Figure 3 Changes
in the emission intensity and fluorescence color of 1o (A) and 1c (B) with addition of Al3+ (0–5.0
equiv) in methanol (λex = 410 nm).

The UV/vis titration experiments were also performed to investigate
the interaction between 1o and Al3+. When
0–5.0 equiv of Al3+ was added, the intensity of
absorption bands at 334 and 434 nm enhanced, while the peak at 389
nm declined gradually, the absorbance at 434 nm remained unchanged
with further addition of Al3+, and two clear isosbestic
points at 356 and 414 nm were found, respectively (Figure 4A), suggesting that only one
stable complex 1o′ was generated in the process.
Simultaneously, the colorless solution turned yellow green. Whereafter,
the interaction of 1c with Al3+ was also investigated.
The intensity of absorption bands at 460 and 594 nm enhanced, and
the peak at 363 nm weakened with increasing amount of Al3+ from 0 to 5.0 equiv, along with which the solution color turned
navy blue from blue (Figure 4B), as a result of the generation of complex 1c′. The absorption spectra of 1o and 1c were
restored instantly with addition of 10.0 equiv of EDTA.

Figure 4 Variations
of absorption spectra and solution color of 1o (A) and 1c (B) caused by Al3+/EDTA in methanol.

The photoisomerization reactions of 1o′ were
also investigated. First, the variation of absorption spectrum of 1o was investigated under the irradiation of ultraviolet light
with 297 nm, the intensity of absorption band centered at 293 nm weakened
gradually, and two new bands centered at 371 and 598 nm were emerged
and increased. It can be found that the yellow green solution turned
to navy blue, which was consistent with the variation of absorption
spectrum, indicating that closed-ring isomer 1c′ was generated (Figure 5A). When the PSS was arrived, three isosbestic points were formed
at 338, 414, and 438 nm, demonstrating that the process is a unimolecular
process. Contrarily, the absorption spectrum and solution color of 1c′ could come back to the original state (1o′) by irradiating visible light (λ > 500 nm). Then, the fluorescence
property of 1o′ was also changed under the irradiation
of ultraviolet light with 297 nm, the fluorescence emission intensity
at 560 nm weakened gradually, and the emission intensity was quenched
by 92.7% at the PSS; the decrease in emission intensity was ascribed
to the photoisomerization from 1o′ to 1c′. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was taken place
from the phthalazine unit to the diarylethene unit, resulting in the
emission quenched, accompanied by the green fluorescence turn black
(Figure 5B). The above
results revealed that 1o′ displayed excellent
fluorescence modulation efficiency and could be used as a fluorescence
switching.

Figure 5 Variations of absorption (A) and fluorescence spectrum (B) of 1o′ in methanol by irradiating with ultraviolet and
visible lights (λex = 410 nm).

The Job’s plot experiment was implemented in the light of
the previous report.72 The result manifested
a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio between Al3+ and 1o (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
the signal peak of ESI-MS at m/z = 794.83 corresponding to [M + Al3+ + NO3– – H+]+ provided a direct
evidence to confirm the 1:1 binding stoichiometry of Al3+ with 1o (Figure S4, Supporting Information). In the light of fluorescence titration curve,
the relationship between F0/(F0 – F) and 1/[Al3+]
exhibited an excellent linear (R = 0.993) (Figure 6B); the association
constant (Ka) was determined as 2.07 ×
104 L mol–1 through the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation.74 The limit of detection (LOD)
of 1o to Al3+ was determined as 5.5 ×
10–8 mol L–1 on the basis of 3δ/s
(Figure S6, Supporting Information).

plot for binding mode of 1o with Al3+ (A),
and (B) Hildebrand–Benesi plot based on 1:1
mode of 1o and Al3+ with Ka = 2.07 × 104 L mol–1.

Figure 7 described
the changes of the partial 1H NMR spectra. Upon addition
of Al3+, the signal (Ha) at 14.56 ppm assigned to −OH
was disappeared, indicating that the oxygen atom on −OH participated
in the coordination. The signal (Hb) at 10.91 ppm assigned to −NH–
exhibited a 0.05 ppm downfield shift. The signal (Hc) at 9.32 ppm
high field shift to 9.20 ppm, and the signal (Hd, He) at 9.10 ppm
split to 9.09 and 8.90 ppm. Therefore, according to the 1:1 stoichiometry,
the possible complexation mode between 1o and Al3+ was exhibited in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Partial 1H NMR spectra of 1o and 1o′ in DMSO-d6 (inset displays
the possible complexation mode of 1o with Al3+).

Based on the above discussion,
the multistate fluorescence switching
behaviors of 1o could be regulated independently by stimulating
with Al3+/EDTA and UV/vis lights. Scheme 2 exhibited the multicontrolled photoswitching
properties of 1o. According to the experimental results,
we designed a combinational logic circuit, which was composed of four
input signals and one output signal. The input signals included UV
light of 297 nm, λ > 500 nm visible light, Al3+,
and EDTA, which were named as In1, In2, In3, and In4, respectively,
while the emission intensity at 560 nm was considered as an output
signal (Figure 8).
The signal of outputs contained “off” or “on”
two states, corresponding to the Boolean value of “0”
or “1”, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of 1o at 613 nm was deemed as an original value, if the fluorescence
intensity at 560 nm in excess of 126 times of the original value,
the output signal was considered as “on” corresponding
to the Boolean value “1”; otherwise, was considered
to be “off” corresponding to the Boolean value “0”.
Therefore, 1o displayed fluorescence switching behavior
of on or off with different inputs. Such as the strings “0,
0, 1, and 0” corresponding input signals In1, In2, In3, and
In4 represented “off, off, on, and off”, respectively.
In this case, 1o transformed to 1o′ when 1o was stimulated by Al3+, resulting
in a prominent enhancement in emission intensity; the output signal
was “on” and the output digit was “1”. Table 1 summarizes the total
probable logic strings in this logic circuit.

In
further to explore the potential application of the sensor in
actual water samples, competitive tests were carried out. The results
indicated that the equal equiv of coexistence ions hardly interfered
fluorescence selective of 1o to Al3+, with
the exception of Cu2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Ni2+ that induced fluorescence quenching (Figure
S7, Supporting Information). Whereafter,
the practical application of 1o in water samples were
measured; three practical water samples including Qingshan Lake, Ganjiang
River, and Tap water were collected from Nanchang City. On the basis
of the methods reported previously,75,76 the obtained
water samples had undergone pretreatment with 0.2 μm membrane
to remove suspended substance, and then different concentrations of
 Al3+ were added separately to the real water samples
to evaluate the recoveries. The recoveries of Al3+ added
in the three water samples were calculated and are summed up in Table 2. The recoveries for
Al3+ were from 99.4 to 102.8%, revealing that the sensor
exhibited a high accuracy in the determination of Al3+ in
the practical water samples.

Conclusions
A novel multiple-state diarylethene with a phthalazine unit was
synthesized successfully. It showed not only prominent photochromic
properties but also high selectivity to Al3+. What’s
more, it also exhibited multistate fluorescent switching capabilities
accompanied by remarkable fluorescent color changes under the stimulation
of chemical reagents and lights. According to these characteristics,
we designed and constructed a combinational logic circuit with four
input signals (UV/vis lights and Al3+/EDTA) and an output
signal (the emission intensity at 560 nm). At the same time, it was
used as a fluorescence sensor to detect Al3+ in the practical
water sample. The study could provide certain help for the synthesis
of novel diarylethene derivatives with multiple-state fluorescence
switching properties.

Experimental Section
General Methods
NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker
AV400 spectrometer using DMSO-d6 as the
solvent. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded by an Agilent
8453 UV/vis spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer,
respectively. Photoirradiation experiments were carried out on an
MUA-165 UV lamp and an MVL-210 visible lamp. Absolute fluorescence
quantum yields were performed using an Absolute PL Quantum Yield Spectrometer
QYC11347-11. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained by a Bruker VERTEX-70
spectrometer. A PE CHN 2400 analyzer was used for elemental analysis.
Melting point was determined by a WRS-1B melting point apparatus.
Without special instructions, all tests were performed at room temperature,
and all samples are of concentration 2.0 × 10–5 mol L–1.

All the reagents were analytically
pure and were not further purified before use in the experiments.
All cationic salts were nitrates with the exception of Mn2+, Ba2+, K+, and Hg2+ (all of them
were chlorates). The corresponding metal salts were dissolved in distilled
water to obtain metal ion solution (0.1 mol L–1).
Similarly, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (Na2EDTA) was dissolved in deionized water to obtain EDTA aqueous solution
(0.1 mol L–1).

Scheme 3 displayed
the synthetic procedure of diarylethene derivative (1o). Compound 2 was prepared by referring to the method
previously reported,66 and compound 3 was purchased and used without further purification. Compound 3 (0.071 g, 0.44 mmol) was added to 5 mL of methanol solution
containing compound 2 (0.25 g, 0.44 mmol), when the reaction
system was continuously stirred and refluxed for 2.0 h, then cooled
in a refrigerator to obtain a yellow precipitate. The crude product
was recrystallized using ethanol to get the target compound 1o (0.23 g, 0.33 mmol) in 68% yield. mp 475–476 K;
