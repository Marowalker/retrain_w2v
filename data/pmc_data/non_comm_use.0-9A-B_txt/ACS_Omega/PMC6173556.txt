Spirotetramat—a
tetramic acid insecticide—is rapidly
metabolized or degraded to give spirotetramat-enol; so, common residue
definitions include the sum of both compounds. In the present study,
two spirotetramat-functionalized derivatives (haptens) have been designed
to generate immunoreagents to these molecules for rapid immunochemical
analysis. Haptens have been synthesized with alternative linker tethering
sites and, for the first time, high-affinity antibodies have been
generated with different specificities to these active principles.
Two sensitive assays have been developed using the same antibody in
different formats, and by using linker-site heterologous haptens,
the selectivity of the final immunoassay could be improved. A generic
immunoassay with sensitivity similar to spirotetramat and spirotetramat-enol
and a specific assay of spirotetramat-enol have been developed. The
described antibody and bioconjugates showed great potential for sensitive
immunosensor development and analysis of this complex analyte.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Spirotetramat
(SP) is the ISO common name for cis-4-(ethoxycarbonyloxy)-8-methoxy-3-(2,5-xylyl)-1-azaspiro[4.5]dec-3-en-2-one
(IUPAC). This is a new-generation biocide that was discovered as a
derivative of the natural antibiotic thiolactomycin.1 In 2013, SP was included in Annex I to Regulation (EC)
number 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning
the placing of plant protection products on the market.2 It belongs to the tetramic acid family, and it
is structurally characterized by a spirocyclic group containing a
dimethylphenyl group and an ethyl carbonate group as substituents
(Figure 1). SP shows
a new mode of action that consists of inhibiting the acetyl-CoA carboxylase
activity, thus blocking the biosynthesis of lipids in a variety of
target insect pests.3 Upon absorption by
the organism, SP is transformed into a more polar enol derivative
(SP-enol) by the hydrolytic cleavage of the ethyl carbonate group
(Figure 1), thus facilitating
its translocation.4 Moreover, SP is a labile
compound that degrades at ambient temperature and particularly under
alkaline conditions—the half-life at pH 9 and 25 °C is
7.6 h—SP-enol being the major degradation product.5 Further metabolism or degradation of SP-enol
can give rise to several supplementary and frequently minor derivatives,
such as spirotetramat-enol glucoside (SP-glc), spirotetramat-ketohydroxy
(SP-keto), spirotetramat-monohydroxy (SP-mono), and spirotetramat-desmethyl-enol.
SP shows moderate-to-low acute toxicity in mammals—LC50 > 4.183 mg/L by inhalation and LD50 > 2000 mg/kg
via
oral and dermal routes in rats, but it has been demonstrated to be
rather toxic to aquatic organisms.5

Analysis of SP is commonly carried
out by high-performance liquid
chromatography with photometric6,7 or mass spectrometry
detection, frequently after quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged,
and safe extraction of samples.8,9 However, the determination
of SP residues in environmental and food samples can be quite complex
because of the diversity of SP metabolites or degradates that can
be present in the sample.10 For risk assessment
studies, both the parent compound and the metabolites are taken into
consideration, whereas a common definition of SP residues for enforcement
or compliance with the maximum residue limits in plant commodities
is the sum of SP and SP-enol, expressed as SP concentration, because
both compounds mostly constitute the bulk of the residues.11,12

Antibody-based analytical techniques are nowadays employed
as complementary
strategies for small chemical contaminant and residue monitoring.
The competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) is probably
the most extended immunochemical method because of its large sample
throughput and its ability to provide quantitative results.13 However, high-quality immunoreagents are required
for attaining these goals. Covalent bioconjugates of the target compound
should be primarily obtained and employed as immunogens to raise antibodies.
Moreover, the bioconjugates are necessary to develop competitive immunoassays.
To our knowledge, the preparation of bioconjugates and the generation
of antibodies to SP have not been reported previously, and consequently
no bioanalytical methods have been described so far for this complex
analyte. The aim of our study was to raise valuable immunoreagents
and to develop sensitive and rapid immunochemical techniques for the
analysis of SP and SP-enol.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Hapten Design and Synthesis
Two functionalized
derivatives of SP (haptens) with alternative linker tethering sites
were designed and synthesized, namely SPc and SPo (Figure 1), to generate antibodies with different specificities. These haptens
incorporated, through two of the oxygenated functions thereof, a carboxylated
hydrocarbon chain that served as a spacer arm for its conjugation
to the carrier proteins. In both cases, the SP framework was fully
maintained, and the introduction of the spacer arm through a C–O
bond ensured minimal modifications of the SP electronic properties,
so that they could be deemed as adequate mimics of the analyte’s
parent structure.

The synthesis of hapten SPc (Figure 1) started
from the metabolite SP-enol (1), which is commercially
available and also readily obtainable from SP by the basic hydrolysis
of the enol-carbonate moiety at the C-4 position.1 The incorporation of the spacer arm at the enolic oxygen
atom was carried out in a three-step sequence starting with the formation
of allyl carbonate 2, via the reaction of SP-enol with
allyl chloroformate, followed by a microwave-assisted cross-metathesis
reaction with 4-pentenoic acid to form a ca. 9:1 trans/cis mixture
of the corresponding olefin 3. Finally, double-bond hydrogenation
under homogeneous conditions using Wilkinson’s catalyst completed
the synthesis of hapten SPc. Thus, the synthesis
of hapten SPc was accomplished from 1 via three steps in a 49% overall yield. The structure of the hapten
and those of the intermediates were confirmed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy,
proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), carbon (13C) NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (data
can be found in section 4.2).

The preparation of hapten SPo (Figure 1) was readily undertaken
from
demethylated SP (5). This compound can be directly obtained
from SP itself,14 although for this work
we prepared it from ketone 4, which was in turn obtained
through a synthetic route similar to the one previously described.15 Thus, the ketone carbonyl group of 4 was stereoselectively reduced under the Luche conditions to the
equatorial hydroxyl group from which the spacer chain was introduced
through an acylation reaction with glutaric anhydride and catalytic
zinc perchlorate hexahydrate under microwave irradiation.16 Hapten SPo was thus obtained
with an overall yield for the two steps of about 44%. The chemical
structures of the hapten and the intermediates were verified by IR
spectroscopy, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS (extended
data are reported in section 4.3).

2.2 Preparation of Bioconjugates
Prior
to coupling with proteins, haptens SPc and SPo were activated through the formation of active esters.
This activation procedure and the subsequent chromatographic purification
led to the corresponding N-hydroxysuccinimidyl esters—SPc-NHS and SPo-NHS esters (Figure 1)—in practically pure
form, thus allowing a precise control of the coupling conditions and
avoiding undesired secondary reactions.

Hapten SPo was coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at basic pH to better
promote the formation of amide bonds between the carboxyl group of
the hapten and the amine groups of the protein. However, under these
conditions, we cannot rule out the fact that partial hydrolysis of
the ethyl carbonate group of the analyte might take place; if so,
the immunogen would be a mixture between SP and SP-enol, which, far
from being a drawback, may be convenient because both substances are
included in the SP residue definition. A hapten-to-protein molar ratio
(MR) of 13 was obtained, which is an optimum value for an immunizing
conjugate (Figure 2A). On the other hand, hapten SPc was coupled to
BSA at neutral pH to avoid the hydrolysis of the carbonate group which,
in this case, would have caused the loss of the SP backbone, thus
forming a bioconjugate with probably only the spacer arm. A rather
low hapten-to-protein MR of 8 was attained in this conjugate (Figure 2A). The lower hapten-to-protein
MR of the SPc conjugate, as compared with that of
hapten SPo, was most probably due to the greater
coupling efficiency of the active ester method at basic pH, as already
mentioned. Assay conjugates based on ovalbumin (OVA) and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) were also prepared for both haptens at neutral pH
and, in terms of applicability, good MRs (3–4 for OVA and 1
for HRP) were obtained (Figure 2).

2.3 Antibody Generation and
Characterization
Two antisera were obtained from each BSA
conjugate, which were
named after the immunizing hapten, and were consecutively numbered
(SPc#1, SPc#2, SPo#1, and SPo#2). The affinity of the four antibodies
to SP and SP-enol was estimated by cELISA in three different formats,
indirect, direct, and capture antibody direct, using the corresponding
homologous assay conjugate (the conjugate that holds the same hapten
as the immunizing conjugate).

For the conjugate-coated indirect
cELISA format, microplate coating was carried out either at pH 7.4
or 9.6, so as to evaluate the potential instability of the conjugates
at high pH. With SPc-type antibodies, and to achieve Amax values around 1.0, a much higher coating
conjugate concentration was required in the plates coated at basic
pH than at neutral pH (Table 1). This result may be indicative of a partial hydrolysis of
the assay hapten when the coating was carried out at basic pH. In
addition, no inhibition was observed, either with SP or SP-enol, using
SPc-type antibodies. We hypothesized that the hydrolysis
of the carbonate group of hapten SPc might have taken
place in the animal body during the immunization process; hence, the
hapten molecule would be released from the conjugate, and the antibodies
recognizing SP or SP-enol would not have been generated. Concerning
SPo-type antibodies, high Amax values were obtained at very low homologous coating conjugate
concentrations, regardless of the coating pH. More significantly,
both SP and SP-enol inhibited the immunochemical reaction between
the antibodies SPo#1 and SPo#2 and
the coating conjugate, even though the IC50 values were
lower for SP-enol than for SP. This result could be explained by a
partial loss of the ethyl carbonate group in the SPo hapten during conjugation and immunization; so, in practice, animals
would have been immunized with a mixture of a conjugate of SP and
an in vivo-formed conjugate of SP-enol.

The obtained antibodies
were also evaluated by the antibody-coated
direct and the capture antibody direct cELISA formats, and similar
results were obtained among each other. Not surprisingly, binding
between SPc-type antibodies and HRP–SPc tracer was not observed (Table 2). On the contrary, binding to the homologous
enzyme tracer (HRP–SPo) was found with both
SPo-type antibodies in the two formats, and, more
importantly, inhibition was observed with SP and SP-enol. Interestingly,
both antibodies showed a much higher affinity to SP-enol than to SP,
probably because of the partial hydrolysis of hapten SPo in the immunizing conjugate, as already mentioned. The lowest IC50 value for SP-enol (1.5 nM) was found with the antibody SPo#1 in the capture format.

2.4 Immunoassay Development
The performance
of the four antibodies in combination with the heterologous conjugate—in
which the hapten is different to that of the immunizing conjugate—was
assessed in the three studied cELISA formats. Unfortunately, none
of the antibodies recognized the heterologous enzyme tracer; so, no
signal was observed with the direct and the capture assay formats.
The situation was quite similar for the indirect format, in which
the antibodies poorly recognized the heterologous coating conjugates
(Table 3); so, no feasible
assays could be developed. Higher MR values of the OVA–SPo conjugate (MR = 15) did not improve the Amax values. The only exception to this general finding
was antibody SPo#1; in plates coated at neutral pH
with the OVA–SPc heterologous conjugate, an
inhibition curve with an Amax value around
1.0 could be obtained. More notably, the observed IC50 values
with the immunoreagent combination were 100-fold (9.47 nM) and 30-fold
(3.60 nM) lower for SP and SP-enol, respectively, than the values
obtained with the homologous assay. Accordingly, further work was
carried out only with antibody SPo#1, either combined
with the heterologous conjugate (OVA–SPc)
in the indirect format or together with the homologous tracer (HRP–SPo) in the capture antibody direct format.

The selectivity of both immunoassays
to the four main metabolites
of SP, that is, SP-enol, SP-glc, SP-keto, and SP-mono, was assessed.
The homologous capture assay was pretty specific of SP-enol, as previously
described. The cross-reactivity (CR) values, referred to SP-enol,
were 1.3% for SP, 2.2% for SP-glc, and almost negligible for SP-keto
and SP-mono. However, the heterologous indirect assay exhibited a
different recognition pattern, with SP and SP-enol being recognized
to a closer extent, whereas the other compounds were again much less
recognized. The CR values were 38 and 100% for SP and SP-enol, respectively,
2.3% for SP-glc, and lower than 0.5% for the rest of the metabolites
(Table 4).

SP	38	1.3	
SP-enol	100	100	
SP-glc	2.3	2.2	
SP-keto	0.2	<0.1	
SP-mono	<0.1	0.1	
Interestingly, the two selected immunoassays employed
the same
antibody but different assay conjugates. The heterology introduced
by hapten SPc in the indirect assay made the IC50 value for SP closer to that of SP-enol, thus resulting in
a more generic assay for both compounds. The presence of the carbonate
group in SPc probably selects the fraction of antibody
molecules that bind the nonhydrolyzed hapten, thus increasing the
apparent affinity to SP. The standard curves for SP and SP-enol in
the two optimized immunoassays are shown in Figure 3. The logarithm of the odds (LOD) values,
calculated as IC10 of the standard curve, were 0.5 and
0.6 nM for SP and SP-enol, respectively, in the indirect assay. On
the other hand, the LOD values for the capture assay were almost 100
times higher for SP than for SP-enol (5 and 0.06 nM, respectively).
These values are in the same range of those of the reference chromatographic
methods,10,17,18 and they suggest
the great potential of the developed immunoassays for SP and SP-enol
residue determination.

Figure 3 Standard curves of the selected immunoassays. The Amax value was around 1.0, and the background
signal was
always near zero. The values are the average of three independent
experiments.

3 Conclusions
Two functionalized derivatives of SP have been synthesized with
equivalent linkers located at different sites of the molecule. The
lability of the carbonate group of the molecule was the determinant
for the generation of antibodies to SP and SP-enol. A cELISA specific
of SP-enol was established with the capture antibody format using
the antibody SPo#1 and the homologous enzyme tracer.
Moreover, a generic cELISA for SP and SP-enol was characterized in
the conjugate-coated indirect format using the same antibody but combined
with a heterologous conjugate. Highly sensitive immunoassays, with
the LOD values in the low nanomolar scale, have been presented as
a proof of principle for the immunoanalysis of this complex chemical
residue.

A solution of acid 3 (59 mg, 0.129 mmol) and Wilkinson catalyst (10 mg, 0.011

4.3 Synthesis of Hapten SPo
To prepare
this hapten (Figure 1), ketone 4 was obtained as described
by Zhao et al.15 The 1H NMR
spectrum of hapten SPo is provided in the Supporting Information.

Ethyl Carbonate (5)
CeCl3·7H2O (100 mg, 0.27 mmol) was added to a solution of ketone 4 (40 mg, 0.11 mmol) in a 1:1 mixture of MeOH and CH2Cl2 (3 mL). The resulting solution was cooled to −12
°C; then, NaBH4 (10.2 mg, 0.27 mmol) was added and
the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 40 min. After
this time, the mixture was treated with a few drops of acetone to
destroy the excess of NaBH4, stirred for 5 min, and poured
into a saturated aqueous solution of sodium citrate and extracted
with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were washed with brine,
dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated at a reduced
pressure to give alcohol 5 (36.6 mg, 88%) as a white
solid. mp 244.6–246.0 °C (crystals obtained by the slow
evaporation of a CHCl3 solution). IR νmax (cm–1): 3361, 3247, 2939, 1780, 1683, 1214, 1065,

Acid (Hapten SPo)
Alcohol 5 (26.6 mg, 0.074 mmol), Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.5 mg, ca. 0.02 equiv), and glutaric anhydride (8.9 mg,
0.078 mmol) were suspended in dry benzene (0.7 mL) in a microwave
vial. The vial was purged with nitrogen, then capped and heated under
a microwave irradiation at 100 °C for 4 h in a CEM Discover apparatus.
The mixture was cooled to room temperature, additional amounts of
Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.5 mg, ca.
0.02 equiv) and glutaric anhydride (8.9 mg, 0.078 mmol) were added,
and the mixture was heated again under the same conditions as above
for additional 3 h. After being cooled, the mixture was diluted with
water and extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed
with brine and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The chromatographic
purification of the residue left after the evaporation of the solvent,
using CHCl3/MeOH mixtures from 100:0 to 97:3 as the eluent,
afforded hapten SPo (17.7 g, 50.5%) as an amorphous
solid. IR νmax (cm–1): 3263, 3013,

4.4 Preparation of Bioconjugates
Active
ester formation was carried out with N,N-disuccinimidyl carbonate and Et3N at 0 °C (Figure 1). The complete activation
procedures as well as the 1H NMR spectra of the corresponding
NHS esters are provided in the Supporting Information. For conjugation, a 50 mM purified hapten solution in N,N-dimethylformamide was dropwise added to a 15
mg/mL BSA or OVA solution in 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (50 mM
carbonate–bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, was used to couple hapten
SPo to BSA) under gentle stirring. A 5 mM purified
hapten solution was slowly mixed with a 2.5 mg/mL HRP solution in
100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for tracer enzyme conjugate preparation.
BSA immunizing conjugates were prepared with a 22-fold molar excess
of purified activated hapten, whereas the OVA and HRP assay conjugates
were prepared with an 8-fold molar excess of hapten. The mixtures
were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, and the conjugates were
purified by gel filtration chromatography using 100 mM phosphate buffer,
pH 7.4, as the eluent. The BSA conjugate solutions were filter-sterilized
with 0.45 μm pore filter units and stored frozen at −20
°C. The OVA conjugates were stored frozen, whereas the HRP conjugates
were diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1%
(w/v) BSA and stored at 4 °C. The obtained hapten-to-protein
MR was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). The sample preparation and MS analysis
of bioconjugates are described in the Supporting Information.

4.5 Antibody Generation
The experimental
design was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of
Valencia. The animals were manipulated according to Spanish laws (RD1201/2005
and law 32/2007) and in compliance with the EU Directive 2010/63EU
about the protection of laboratory animals. Two groups of two female
New Zealand white rabbits were subcutaneously immunized with 300 μg
of either BSA–SPc or BSA–SPo. Four injections were applied at 21 day intervals. The
immunogen consisted of a 1:1 emulsion between PBS and Freund’s
adjuvant (complete for the first injection and incomplete for subsequent
boosts). Ten days after the last injection, the animals were exsanguinated
by intracardiac puncture, and blood was let to coagulate at 4 °C
during 24 h. Then, the serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min. The immunoglobulins were partially purified
from the animal sera by salting out twice with one volume of a cold
saturated (3.90 M) ammonium sulfate solution. The antibodies were
stored precipitated at 4 °C.

4.6 Competitive
ELISA
Immunoassays were
carried out in three different competitive ELISA formats. The indirect
format was employed by immobilizing on the microplate wells the OVA–hapten
conjugates and using an enzyme-labeled secondary antibody. The direct
format was performed with antibody-coated plates and using the HRP–hapten
enzyme tracers. Finally, the capture antibody direct format was evaluated
with immobilized goat antirabbit immunoglobulin and the corresponding
enzyme tracers in solution. Eight-point standard curves in PBS (10
mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mM NaCl) were prepared
in borosilicate glass vials by serial dilution, including a blank
without analyte. The ELISA absorbance values were fitted to a four-parameter
logistic equation. Assay sensitivity was defined as the concentration
of analyte at the inflexion point of the sigmoidal curve, typically
corresponding to a 50% inhibition (IC50) of the maximum
signal (Amax). Antibody titer was defined
as the antibody dilution affording an Amax value near to 1.0. The assay selectivity was estimated from the
quotient between the IC50 of the reference analyte and
the IC50 of the cross-reacting compound. For complete immunoassay
procedures, see the Supporting Information.
