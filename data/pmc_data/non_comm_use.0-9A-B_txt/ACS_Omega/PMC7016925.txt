A rapid and simple method based on
the coupling of supercritical
fluid extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography
combined with Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (SFE-UHPLC-Q-Exactive
Orbitrap-MS) detection for the identification of compounds from Citrus reticulata semen (CRS) was developed for the
first time in this study. Through the optimization of the SFE parameters
including extractive pressure, extractive temperature, and time, most
of the compounds were successfully extracted at 50 °C, 33 MPa,
and 2 h without an entraining agent, among which 32 compounds were
successfully identified. Moreover, the operating conditions of UHPLC-Q-Exactive
Orbitrap-MS were also optimized for the analysis of the SFE extracts,
and the extracts in the CRS showed good separation performance in
20 min. A total of 28 compounds from the SFE extract were identified
by comparing the standard sample together with full scan and related
literature data, among which esters and flavonoids were the major
compounds identified in the CRS extracts. In addition, 2 phenols,
2 aldehydes, 2 triterpenes, and 5 other compounds were identified.
The SFE-UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS method was successfully validated
and applied for the identification of compounds from the CRS.

1 Introduction
The Citrus
reticulata semen (CRS)
is the dry, mature seed of C. reticulata Blanco and its cultivated varieties and has been consumed as a traditional
Chinese medicine for centuries with its properties including qi regulation,
knot dispersion, pain relief, and so on.1,2 However, compared
with Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, the chemical composition of CRS
has not been fully studied; most Citrus seeds are discarded rather than being exploited, resulting in resource
waste and environmental pollution. Therefore, the study of its chemical
components is of great significance for its further utilization in
medicine and raw materials. Therefore, the purpose of this study is
to establish a fast and efficient method for the comprehensive analysis
and identification of phytochemical components in supercritical fluid
extraction (SFE) extracts of CRS.

As a kind of low-temperature
extraction technology, supercritical
fluid CO2 extraction (SFE) has the advantages of low toxicity,
noncombustibility, high diffusion, gas-like viscosity, liquid-like
density, sample processing automation, and high extraction efficiency.3 In addition, liquid chromatography (LC)–MS
is often used for the analysis of phytochemical components, and in
recent years, ultra-high-performance LC combined with Q-Exactive Orbitrap
tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS) has become
a faster, more efficient, and more sensitive tool than HPLC–MS
for the rapid analysis of plant extracts and bioactive compounds in
some traditional Chinese medicines. As far as we know, only a few
analytical methods are used for the determination of CRS at present.
Previously reported analytical methods were only used to analyze the
oil contained in it and one or several specific chemical components
such as limonin and obacunone by GC–MS analysis or HPLC method,
lacking systematic analysis. Thus, in order to evaluate the quality
of CRS more comprehensively, an efficient method based on the coupling
of SFE-UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS detection was developed in this
paper, and the chemical components in the SFE extracts of CRS were
systematically analyzed. This study is of great significance and provides
a valuable basis for further scientific research and application of
CRS in food, medicine, health care products, and other fields.

2 Results and Discussion
The SFE extracts of CRS were
analyzed by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS
analysis. By optimizing a series of parameters such as flow rate and
elution gradient of mobile phase, better analytical conditions are
obtained. Under the optimal conditions, the components of SFE extracts
in CRS could be separated in the positive mode within 19 min. The
method is fast and efficient. The TIC diagram is shown in Figure 1. A total of 32 compounds
were identified and separated and numbered 1–32 according to
the sequence of peak time (Table 1). Totally, 29 SFE extracts constituents were divided
into the following groups: 10 esters, 7 flavones, 2 phenols, 2 aldehydes,
2 triterpenes, and 6 other compounds. The identification of all these
compounds was mainly based on MS/MS fragments and the analysis of
literature. For a compound with a standard, the retention times and
fragments of the compound should be compared with the standard under
the same test conditions. Among them, 8 compounds were identified
through comparison with standard products, and 20 compounds were identified
based on MS/MS-positive ion fragments and relevant data from previous
studies. Their chemical structures were illustrated in Figure 2.

a Further confirmation in comparison

2.1 Identification of Esters
Esters are
major constituents extracted from the SFE extracts of CRS. Ten esters
were identified in SFE extracts including N-butylidenephthalide,
ligustilides, atractylenolide-I, atractylenolide-II, scoparone, ethyl
ferulate, linolenic acid ethyl ester, and linderalactone. In positive
mode, characteristic fragment ions such as CO, H2O, and
alkyl side chain were prone to lose in these kinds of compounds in
high-energy collisions.4

In this
paper, for example, identification and characterization of structures
were discussed about ligustilides, atractylenolide-I, and atractylenolide-II.
Peak 27 produced a relatively strong molecular ion peak at m/z 191.1064 for [M + H]+ and
relatively low intensity peaks at m/z 173.0959 for [M + H – H2O]+, 163.1115
for [M + H – CO]+, 145.1010 for [M + H –
H2O – CO]+, and at m/z 117.0700 for [M + H – H2O –
CO – C2H4]+. Based on the
characteristic fragmentation profiles, peak 27 were identified as
ligustilides by comparing with the characteristic ions from previous
study.5

Peak 22 was assigned to be
atractylenolide-I by comparison with
literature,6 which gave a molecular ion
peak [M + H]+ at m/z 231.1378
and fragment ion peak at m/z 213.1274
for [M + H – H2O]+ and m/z 189.0910, 185.1324, 175.0754, 163.0752, 143.0855,
105.0702, and 91.0547. The detailed fragmentation process is shown
in Figure 3a.

Figure 3 Proposed fragmentation
pathways of main fragment ions for atractylenolide-I
(a), atractylenolide-II (b), nobiletin (c), and limonin (d) in positive
ion mode.

Peak 29 provided precursor ion
peak of [M + H]+ at m/z 233.1533 and fragment ion peaks at m/z 215.1428 for [M + H – H2O]+, m/z 187.1479
for [M + H – H2O – CO]+, m/z 159.0803 for [M + H – H2O – CO – C2H4]+, m/z 145.1010 for [M + H –
H2O – CO – C3H6]+, m/z 131.0854 for [M +
H – H2O – CO – C4H8]+, and m/z 105.0701
for [M + H – H2O – CO – C6H10]+. Furthermore, combined with literature7 and reference formula provided by MS, it was
therefore confirmed as atractylenolide-II. The detailed fragmentation
pattern of peak 29 is shown in Figure 3b.

are important components of natural flavonoids in Citrus. According to the classification of flavonoids, they were divided
into normal flavones, flavanones, and polymethoxylated flavones.8,9

With the high-resolution UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS system,
a total of seven flavonoids were identified in the SFE extracts of
CRS including peaks 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 23, and 26. Among them, peaks
26, 20, 16, and 23 were unambiguously identified as 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone,
3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′-heptamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, and
tangeretin by comparing with the literature and the reference standard
with the same fragmentation pattern. Nobiletin was selected as a typical
example of flavonoids to illustrate the fragmentation pathways. Nobiletin
is a polymethoxylated flavone with six methoxy substituents in its
structure, which produces strong molecular ion peaks at m/z 403.1385 and formed relatively lower intensities
of MS2 fragments at m/z 388.1148 for [M + H – CH3]+, m/z 373.0914 for [M + H – 2CH3]+, m/z 358.0676
for [M + H – 3CH3]+, and m/z 327.0854 for [M + H – 3CH3 –
CH3O]+, among others, with a series of characteristic
losses of CH3 and CH3O. Figure 3c depicts the proposed fragmentation pattern.

2.3 Identification of Limonins
Limonoids
are secondary metabolites of tetracyclic triterpenes in Rutaceae and
Meliaceae widely distributed in the seeds and membranes of Citrus fruits, which are a major group of chemical
constituents from CRS. Two limonoids were identified in SFE extracts,
including limonoid and obacunone, after comparison with fragments
of the standard reference and literature.10,11

Taking limonin, for example, according to the literature,
the fragmentation model of the standard substance and the fragment
ions provided by MS can be known, and the positive ion of limonin
was detected at m/z 471.2012. The
generation of m/z 425.1955 fragment
ions was due to neutral loss of the ester group in lactonic ring D.
The fragment ion peak at m/z 409.2001
indicates that the epoxy group can transform into dihydroxyl after
deleting the carboxyl group. The loss of the epoxy group and the lactone
ring A produced fragments of ions at m/z 367.1904 and m/z 339.1947, respectively.
In addition, the fragment ions at m/z 161.0597 were generated because of the cleavage of ring C. The detailed
fragmentation schemes are shown in Figure 3d.

2.4 Identification of Others
In addition,
except for four unknown compounds, nine other compounds including
peak 25, peak 1, peak 3, peak 2, peak 5, peak 14, peak 6, peak 7,
peak 21, and peak 10 were identified as atractylodin, caffeine, nicotinamide,
nicotinic acid, tetramethylpyrazine, 2-adamantanone, two phenols (vanillin,
3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde), and two aldehydes (p-anisaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde), respectively, combined with literature12−21 and reference formula provided by MS. Using peak 25 as example,
peak 25 showed an ion signal at m/z 183.0804 [M + H]+ in the MS spectrum. In the MS2 spectrum, the major fragment ion peaks were at m/z 159.9689, m/z 131.9742, m/z 113.9638, and m/z 105.0338 [M + H – C6H6]+. Peak 25 was identified as atractylodin
by comparing the reference formula and previous research.

3 Conclusions
In the present study, all samples from
CRS were extracted by supercritical
carbon dioxide under optimized conditions, and a total of 32 compounds
released from all of these varieties of SFE extracts were separated
and identified by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS including 10 esters,
seven flavonoids, two phenols, two aldehydes, two triterpenes, and
nine other compounds, among which nine esters were first identified
in CRS. The analysis results showed that the chemical composition
of SFE extracts and methanol extracts was significantly different.
According to our previous studies, methanol extracts of CRS mainly
consist of hesperidin, neohesperidin, and other compounds with greater
polarity, as well as medium-polarity compounds such as nobiletin and
tangeretin, hardly containing ester and other low-polarity compounds.
The SFE extracts used in this study were mainly low-polarity compounds
such as esters and medium-polarity compounds such as flavonoids.

According to the literature studies, the triterpenoids and ester
compounds in CRS have good pharmacological activities. For example,
the triterpenoid limonin has antitumor,22,23 analgesic,
and anti-inflammatory effects,24 while
obacunone has anti-inflammatory,25 antioxidation,26 and antitumour effects.27,28 Esters, moreover, as ligustilides, were effective for limiting the
oxidative stress29 and anti-inflammatory
effect.30

Since ancient times, China
has a history of using CRS as a traditional
Chinese medicine. However, because of the lack of systematic research
on the chemical components contained in CRS and the lack of research
on the biological activity of its chemical components, the application
of CRS is limited and the quality is varied. Therefore, the composition
of compounds in the middle- and low-polar compounds in CRS was investigated
through the SFE-UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-MS method for the first
time in this study, which laid a foundation for further scientific
research and application of the CRS.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials and Reagents
About 10 kg
of fresh Xinhui Citrus was collected
from Nantan Island, Xinhui District, Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province,
in October 2017 and identified as the fruit of C. reticulata “Chachi” by Professor Zheng Guodong from the school
of Pharmacy, Guangzhou Medical University. After removing the peel
and pulp of the fresh Citrus, the seeds
were collected, washed, dried, and stored in the Pharmacognosy Laboratory,
School of Pharmacy, Guangzhou Medical University. Eight compounds
were used as reference standards with purity greater than 98%. Among
them, 3,5,6,7,8,3′,4′-heptamethoxyflavone and 5-hydroxy-6,7,8,3′,4′-pentamethoxyflavone
were purchased from Sichuan Weikeqi Biotechnology Co., Ltd and Nanjing
Chunqiu Biological Engineering Co. Ltd, respectively. All the others
were purchased from Chengdu Mansite Biotechnology Co. Ltd. In addition,
acetonitrile and MS-grade formic acid were bought from Thermo Fisher
Scientific (China) Co. and Merck KGaA Company of Germany, Ltd., respectively.
Other reagents were all of analytical grade.

4.2 Sample
Preparation
The 50 g powder
samples of CRS were directly loaded into the SFE kettle having a specification
of 50 g without the use of any kind of support material and entrainer
for the SFE extraction. The SFE conditions were as follows: extraction
temperature: 50 °C, extractive pressure: 33 MPa, extractive time:
2 h, and CO2 flow rate: 0.05 L/min. The SFE sample was
collected, placed into a vial, and stored at 4 °C. Prior to analysis,
the reserved solution was further diluted with dichloromethane to
an appropriate concentration and filtered through a needle-type microporous
membrane with an aperture of 0.22 μm.

4.3 Analytical
System
The ultra-high-performance
LC was carried out on an Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo
Scientific, USA) equipped with an online degasser, a quaternary pump,
an autosampler, and a column temperature compartment, which was connected
to a Q-Exactive Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
USA) via an electrospray ionization interface and high-resolution
MS detection was performed in the positive ion mode, and the data
were acquired in full scan mode. A ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 (2.1 mm × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) was utilized at 40 °C and
eluted with a gradient solvent from A/B (90:10) to A/B (10:90) at
a flow rate of 0.50 mL/min, where A is 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solution
and B is 0.1% (v/v) formic acid solution of acetonitrile. The linear
gradient elution was as follows: 0–2 min, 10–25% B;
2–4 min, 25–25% B; 4–10 min, 25–50% B;
10–14 min, 50–50% B; 14–18 min, 50–85%
B; and 18–19 min, 85–90% B.
