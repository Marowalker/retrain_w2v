Investigating how grain structure
affects the functional properties
of nanoparticles requires a robust method for nanoscale grain mapping.
In this study, we directly compare the grain mapping ability of transmission
Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) in a scanning electron microscope to automated
crystal orientation mapping (ACOM) in a transmission electron microscope
across multiple nanoparticle materials. Analysis of well-defined Au,
ZnO, and ZnSe nanoparticles showed that the grain orientations and
GB geometries obtained by TKD are accurate and match those obtained
by ACOM. For more complex polycrystalline Cu nanostructures, TKD provided
an interpretable grain map whereas ACOM, with or without precession
electron diffraction, yielded speckled, uninterpretable maps with
orientation errors. Acquisition times for TKD were generally shorter
than those for ACOM. Our results validate the use of TKD for characterizing
grain orientation and grain boundary distributions in nanoparticles,
providing a framework for the broader exploration of how microstructure
influences nanoparticle properties.

Introduction
The underlying grain
structure of nanomaterials strongly affects
their functional properties. Studies of well-defined semiconducting
nanowires have identified specific effects of grain orientations,
phase boundaries, and defect densities on electronic, optical, thermoelectric,
and (photo)electrochemical properties.1−8 A broader understanding of these phenomena across diverse semiconductor
materials is crucial for the design of next-generation optical/electronic
devices. Recent studies have also probed the effects of the grain
structure on the catalytic properties of nanomaterials. We showed
that grain boundary (GB) density is directly correlated to catalytic
activity for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO on Au
nanoparticles and CO reduction to ethanol and acetate on Cu nanoparticles.9,10 GB effects have been implicated in other electrocatalytic reactions
including methanol electro-oxidation on Pt nanoparticles11 and PtRu nanoparticles12 and the oxygen evolution reaction on perovskite oxides.13 GB–activity relationships in nanomaterials
may arise from the accumulation of defects in the vicinity of the
GB surface termination, which we have recently observed in scanning
probe studies of large-grained electrodes.14 Utilizing GBs as a design element for nanoparticles in heterogeneous
catalysis will require elucidating how activity depends on the GB
structure.

A major bottleneck for studying these structure–function
relationships is the difficulty of mapping grain structures on the
nanoscale. One technique is automated crystal orientation mapping
(ACOM), which is performed in a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
equipped with a specialized control unit (NanoMEGAS DigiSTAR/ASTAR
system).15−18 In ACOM, an electron beam is rastered across an electron-transparent
sample while spot electron diffraction patterns are collected for
offline analysis (Figure 1A). The patterns are indexed to a database of calculated patterns
for known materials at different orientations to generate maps that
show the size and orientation of the individual grains and consequently
the density and geometries of the GBs. By precessing the incident
electron beam around the optic axis while tilting the beam through
a small angle during ACOM (a technique known as precession electron
diffraction, PED), a broader range of reflections with quasi-kinematical
intensities can be measured in a reciprocal space, improving the orientation
indexing of collected diffraction patterns. ACOM/PED has mostly been
used to obtain high-resolution maps of nanograined thin-film samples
prepared by conventional TEM polishing techniques.19−21 A few recent
studies have also used it to map the grain structure in discrete nanoparticles.22−24 However, it is very challenging to map structures with overlapping
grains and nonuniform thickness,25−27 which are critical for
studying nanoparticles used in catalysis. Moreover, the need for a
TEM with specialized equipment currently limits the accessibility
of ACOM/PED.

SEM.

As an alternative to ACOM, Keller
and Geiss recently introduced
transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), which is performed in a scanning
electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an electron backscatter diffraction
(EBSD) detector.28−31 As an electron beam is rastered across the sample, inelastic scattering
within the top portion of the sample generates a divergent source
of forward scattered electrons, some of which are diffracted by the
bottom portion of the sample to generate Kikuchi bands. The pattern
of Kikuchi bands from each spot is captured by the detector. The angles
between triplets of intersecting bands in each pattern are indexed
to a database of calculated interplanar angles to obtain a grain orientation,
resulting in a spatially resolved orientation map for the sample (Figure 1B). In general, data
acquisition is faster in TKD because of the higher signal yield from
the phosphor screen to the CCD camera in an EBSD detector. Because
SEMs are commonly equipped with EBSD hardware, TKD is accessible in
most electron microscopy facilities, in contrast to the relatively
limited accessibility of ACOM/PED.

TKD has been used to study
nanograined thin films and nanoparticles.32−36 A few studies have examined the same samples using
both TKD and
ACOM/PED.32,37−39 However, especially
for nanoparticle samples, there has not been a systematic comparison
of grain orientation maps obtained by TKD versus ACOM/PED. Such a
comparison is needed to illuminate key advantages and limitations
of both, particularly for challenging irregular samples. In this study,
we compare the grain mapping ability of ACOM/PED and TKD using well-defined
Au, ZnSe, and ZnO nanoparticles and irregular, highly polycrystalline
Cu nanoparticles. With well-defined nanoparticles, we show that TKD
provides the same orientation and GB geometry information as ACOM.
For the more complex Cu nanoparticles, we demonstrate that TKD provides
an interpretable grain map, whereas ACOM yields highly speckled, uninterpretable
maps. These comparisons motivate the broader utilization of TKD to
investigate grain structure–function relationships in nanoparticles.

Results
and Discussion
To assess nanoparticle orientation imaging
with TKD, we synthesized
well-defined Au nanoplates via a templated colloidal method from ∼2
nm Au nanoparticle precursors.40 Drop drying
the Au nanoplates onto a Cu TEM grid backed by an ultrathin film of
carbon allowed for both secondary electron (SE) and TKD imaging within
a SEM. The samples were attached to a 45° SEM sample holder via
a stainless steel needle (Figure S1). To
minimize acquisition time for the materials studied here, we iteratively
determined the minimum pattern resolutions and exposure times required
for orientation indexing (Table S1). SE
images of the two Au nanoplates are provided in Figure 2A,D. With an exposure time of 9.3 ms and
a pixel size of 10 nm, the total acquisition time for each ∼4
μm2 map was ∼1.3–1.5 min each. TKD
orientation maps of a hexagonal and a triangular Au nanoplate (AuNP-1
and AuNP-2, respectively) of ∼700–800 nm across indicated
that the Au nanoplates are single crystalline and oriented along the
[111] direction (Figure 2B,E, blue color, and legend in Figure 2I). Representative TKD patterns are shown in Figure 2C,F. While the surface
normals of both nanoplates are oriented in the [111] direction, differences
in the patterns were observed due to the sensitivity of TKD to rotations
in the x–y plane (Figure S2). Because of sample drift, very small
TKD pattern shifts were detected during orientation mapping and were
quantified by inspection of the linear misorientation profiles obtained
from the top to the bottom of the nanoplates. The slopes of the linear
regression from the misorientation profiles indicated an angular drift
of ∼0.002°/nm (Figure 2H). A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern
obtained with TEM of a single triangular 500 nm Au nanoplate confirmed
that the nanoplate normal was parallel to the [111] direction (Figure 2G). These measurements
corroborate earlier XRD studies showing that the as-synthesized Au
nanoplates are aligned along the [111] direction.41 The match between our TKD and TEM measurements indicates
that the nanoplates are truly single crystalline and that the TKD-derived
orientation is accurate.

Some caution is required when interpreting the orientations obtained
by TKD. The computed orientation is directly derived from the physical
alignment of the diffracting planes relative to a calibration plane
(the specimen plane). Discrete nanoparticles that are aggregated will
show different grain orientations if aggregation tilts one particle
relative to another. To illustrate, we imaged a pair of smaller Au
nanoplates (AuNP-3 and AuNP-4), with AuNP-4 lying partially atop AuNP-3.
SE imaging (Figure 2K) showed that AuNP-3 and AuNP-4 are ∼400 and ∼300
nm across, respectively. Acquisition of the ∼2 μm2 TKD map at 7 nm step size required only 46 s with a 7 ms
exposure time. Using AuNP-3 as the calibration area for the detector,
the specimen normal direction of AuNP-3 was indexed to be very close
to [111], while the specimen normal direction of AuNP-4 was close
to [111] but tilted away by ∼14° (Figure 2L). The apparent misalignment from the [111]
direction reflects how AuNP-4 lies atop AuNP-3 (Figure 2J) and results from a real difference in
the electron beam incidence angle relative to the (111) planes in
the nanoplates. Care must therefore be applied when interpreting the
TKD-obtained orientations, given that nanoparticles tend to aggregate
in 3D during sample preparation.

The crystallinity of metal
oxide nanoparticles has previously been
correlated to catalytic and electronic activity using XRD- and TEM-based
analyses.42,43 To investigate if TKD could provide orientation
information on discrete oxide nanoparticles, we examined zinc oxide
(ZnO) nanowires grown via the thermal oxidation of an etched Zn foil
at 400 °C in air.44 SE images show
that the ∼5 μm-long ZnO nanowires grow vertically from
a porous ZnO underlayer (Figure 3D,E and Figure S3). A sample
was prepared for TKD by swiping a lacey C/Cu TEM grid over the ZnO
foil immersed in isopropanol. Using a pixel size of 51 nm and exposure
time of 50 ms, ∼105 μm2 TKD maps (Figure 3C,F) required ∼7.5–9.3
min of acquisition time. As ZnO is 2.4× less dense than Au, relatively
long exposure times were necessary for pattern collection. TKD patterns
from the ZnO nanowires exhibit Kikuchi bands with high contrast (Figure 3A,G). Along the normal
direction, the ZnO nanowires were found to be aligned closely along
the [0001] direction (Figure 3I), consistent with previous XRD-based studies of thermally
grown ZnO films.45 The slight deviation
from the [0001] direction is a consequence of the ZnO nanowire not
lying perfectly flat on the substrate, similar to what was observed
with AuNP-3 and AuNP-4. Certain areas bisecting the ZnO nanowires
could not be indexed. In some cases, these pixels correspond to regions
through which the electron beam must also pass through the lacey carbon
support film on the TEM grid. Scattering by the lacey carbon support
film can significantly attenuate or change the diffracted signal from
the ZnO nanowire, leading to pattern misindexing (Figure 3B,H). In addition, variations
in the sample thickness could also produce unindexable pixels because
the diffracted signal is attenuated for thin regions.30

The presence of GBs in semiconducting nanostructures
can strongly
influence charge transport, optical, and thermoelectric properties.5−7,46 To assess the GB geometries obtained
by TKD, we mapped the grain structure of semiconductor ZnSe nanoribbons
using both TKD and ACOM. The ZnSe nanoribbons (ZnSe-NRs) were grown
on an Au/Si film via a thermal evaporation method in a H2 atmosphere.47 SE and TEM images show
that the ZnSe-NRs are 300–2000 nm in diameter and 5–10
μm long and are composed of small jagged branches that grow
from the central nanowire axis (Figure 4A,E and Figures S4 and S5). Previous high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) studies have found that thermally evaporated ZnSe can
crystallize as flat nanoribbons either in the pure cubic zincblende
phase or possess internal wurtzite/zincblende phase boundaries.48,49 Apart from pixels rendered unindexable by scattering from the underlying
lacey carbon, we found that our ZnSe-NRs crystallize largely in the
hexagonal wurtzite phase (Figure S4).

Using a 23 nm pixel size and a total acquisition time of
8.9 min
(50 ms exposure time), we obtained a ∼34 μm2 TKD map of ZnSe-NR1 that showed a single GB along its length, indicating
bicrystallinity (Figure 4B). Despite occlusion from the TEM grid (causing the V-shaped pattern),
TKD patterns with good contrast (Figure 4C,D) enabled indexing of the ZnSe-NR1 crystallites,
with the pink and green crystallites appearing closely oriented along
the [0001] and [112̅0] directions, respectively. Inspection
of a linear misorientation profile across the central axis of ZnSe-NR1
showed that the GB angle is ∼65° (Figure 4J). The GB density (ρGB)
calculated by dividing the GB length by the projected area is 2.44
μm–1. As seen previously in the ZnO nanowires,
some unindexable points were observed in ZnSe-NR1, which may arise
from interference by the lacey carbon and variations in sample thickness.
Attempts to reduce the number of unindexable regions by using an ultrathin
carbon support film in place of the lacey carbon were unsuccessful
(Figure S5).

An ACOM map (∼0.3
μm2) of a smaller ZnSe
nanoribbon (ZnSe-NR2) 150–200 nm in diameter similarly showed
the nanoribbon bisected longitudinally by a single GB (Figure 4F). Images were acquired using
a 3–5 nm step size and an exposure time of 30 ms. Strikingly,
clear electron diffraction patterns (Figure 4G,H) showed that ZnSe-NR2 was oriented in
an almost identical fashion to ZnSe-NR1, indicating excellent agreement
between TKD and ACOM. A higher 2D GB surface density was obtained
for ZnSe-NR2 (17.7 μm–1) as it is narrower
in width. Because the obtained pattern in ACOM is highly dependent
on the sample thickness, speckling and misindexing were observed at
the periphery of and within ZnSe-NR2 (yellow circles, Figure 4F). Nonetheless, the consistency
between ACOM and TKD in both orientation and GB geometry data (with
comparable noise levels in the misorientation profiles) provides validation
for the use of TKD in nanoparticle grain characterization. Consistency
in the recorded GB angle and orientations was also observed when another
pair of ZnSe-NRs was imaged with TKD and ACOM (Figure S6).

Cu nanomaterials are important for electronic,
sensing, and catalytic
applications, including the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 and CO to multicarbon fuels. While conventional X-ray diffraction
methods can be used to determine average grain sizes and texturing
of polydisperse nanoparticle samples, information about the local
GB geometry and GB density of individual nanoparticles is needed to
unravel microstructural phenomena in detail. To evaluate the ability
of TKD to map highly polycrystalline catalyst materials, we prepared
oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) nanowires via an established two-step thermal
oxidation–reduction route.50 SE
images show that the Cu nanowires (CuNWs) project orthogonally away
from the precursor Cu mesh and have variant lengths and thicknesses
(Figure S7). Samples for TKD mapping were
prepared by gently removing the nanowires from the mesh and drop-drying
them onto a TEM grid. A single, 100–400 nm thick, ∼18
μm long CuNW (Cu-NW1) was first mapped using a 41 nm pixel size
and 7 ms exposure time. Obtaining a ∼186 μm2 TKD map of the entire Cu-NW1 required only 1.5 min (Figure 5A and legend in Figure 5E). This low-resolution map
shows 66 individual grains in Cu-NW1 with an average grain size of
0.18 μm and a broad size distribution (Figure 5C). Inverse pole figures (Figure 5B) show that in the Z direction,
large portions of the grains are oriented parallel to the [111] direction
in this particular nanowire. The distribution of grain boundary misorientations
showed a large number of GBs oriented close to 60° (likely corresponding
to twin GBs) and a second maximum of low-angle GBs (Figure 5D).

and calculated GB densities (ρGB) of Cu-NW1a-c. Maps

To probe the grain structure of Cu-NW1 on the nanoscale and quantify
ρGB, orientation maps were collected along the length
using a pixel size of ∼9 nm and a 7 ms exposure time (labeled
as Cu-NW1a-c in Figure 5F–H). Each ∼4–10 μm2 map required
only ∼1–1.5 min. Approximately 85% of the GBs in Cu-NW1
were found to be coincident site lattice (CSL) GBs, with 92% of those
CSL GBs adopting Σ3<111>60° twin geometry, corroborating
the GB misorientation distribution of the whole wire. The high-magnification
mapping also revealed that 5% of the CSL GBs adopted the Σ9<110>39°
geometry. The ρGB calculated from the TKD maps of
Cu-NW1a-c was similar, with an average of 7.2 ± 0.6 μm–1. Because of the mechanism of TKD pattern generation
(Figure 1B), the presence
of multiple crystallites through thick regions of the NW either results
in unindexable regions with no distinct Kikuchi bands or identification
of only the bottommost crystallite of the NW. The ρGB values are therefore lower bounds that represent the value for a
particle in which there is only one grain in the interaction volume
for each pixel.

To assess the mapping ability on smaller length
scales, TKD maps
of CuNWs that were 30–50 nm thick and 200–1500 nm in
length (Cu-NW2 through CuNW4) were obtained using 2.5–5 nm
pixel sizes. The 0.7–7 μm2 maps were obtained
in 3–5 min (Figure 6A–C and example patterns in Figure 6D,E and Figure S8). In contrast to Cu-NW1, Cu-NW2 through Cu-NW4 displayed no distinct
texture, indicating a large diversity in orientation across the NWs
present in OD-Cu. Local misorientation profiles (Figure 6K,L) across Cu-NW3 and Cu-NW4
show that the grains are 25–100 nm across. Local misorientation
analysis also yielded insight into GB geometry. A small ∼20
nm twin domain terminated by a pair of Σ3<111>60°
GBs
was detected in Cu-NW3, in addition to a ∼23° GB at the
tip of the NW (yellow circles in Figure 6B,C). A much larger 75 nm twin domain was
observed in the middle of Cu-NW4. The ρGB values
were calculated to be 9.7, 16.3, and 13.1 μm–1 for Cu-NW2, Cu-NW3, Cu-NW4, respectively. These values were somewhat
higher than Cu-NW1, indicating substantial variance in the degree
of polycrystallinity between individual OD-Cu nanowires.

L) Linear misorientation profiles obtained from the dashed lines in
TKD maps (B) and (C). (M, N) Linear misorientation profiles obtained

Using ACOM, isolated OD-Cu nanowires were imaged using a probe
size of 5 nm and exposure time of ∼40 ms (Figure 6F–H and image quality
maps in Figure S9). As seen in the TKD
maps, the Cu NWs appear highly polycrystalline, with 25–100
nm grains, and have no preferred orientation. In contrast to the TKD
maps, speckling was observed in the ACOM maps; regions of different
thicknesses within the same grain were indexed to different orientations.
For instance, the orientation profile within a large crystallite in
NW7 (Figure 6H, tan
grain) fluctuated by ∼15° over the length of the grain
(Figure 6N). Example
diffraction patterns from adjacent regions of the tan grain (Figure 6I,J) show that the
appearance of minor reflections in some of the pixels led to pattern
misindexing. Unlike the misorientation profiles obtained with TKD
(Figure 6K,L), the
profiles obtained with ACOM across NW6 and NW7 (Figure 6M,N) suggest that the detected patterns in
these regions are generated by more than one grain in the interaction
volume.

For most applications of orientation mapping in nanocrystalline
specimens, PED provides more accurate orientation indexing than ACOM
because precessing the beam reveals more of the reciprocal space during
acquisition. To assess how TKD would compare to state-of-the-art PED
techniques, we collected additional PED maps of an identically prepared
Cu nanowire (Cu-NW8) using a precession angle of 0.7°, 4 nm step
size, and an exposure time of 40 ms (Figure S10A,B). Comparison of the maps collected with and without precession (Figure S10C,D) showed that orientation indexing
in regions of Cu-NW8 with nonuniform thickness remained ambiguous.
Large variations in the misorientation profiles within the grain interiors
were observed (Figure S10E,F). For Cu NWs
with uneven thicknesses, scattering from multiple grains during ACOM
or PED acquisition renders the resulting orientation maps difficult
to interpret.32 Consequently, it was not
possible to compute even lower-bound ρGB or a misorientation
distribution with the ACOM/PED system because the presence of GBs
could not be assigned with confidence in the speckled regions. Within
a portion of a nanowire of an uneven thickness, PED could be employed
to obtain GB distributions by acquiring a tilt series of the grain,
although obtaining quantitative GB densities for a highly heterogeneous
ensemble would be very laborious.51

Even with state-of-the-art subtracting-indexing algorithms, resolved,
planar 2D maps of the grain structure in nanostructures with multiple
overlapping grains remain inaccessible with ACOM/PED, leading to diminished
sensitivity to surface structural features relative to TKD.26 In contrast, the majority of the diffracted
electrons in TKD come from the grains at the bottom of the sample.31,52 In vertical sections with two or more grains, the pattern will likely
be of the bottommost grain or appear unindexable. Thus, for irregular,
polycrystalline nanoparticles, TKD provides a simplified orientation
map of surface-exposed grains, which enables quantification of lower-bound
estimates of ρGB and GB geometry distributions that
cannot be obtained with ACOM/PED.

The ability to rapidly map
the nanoparticle grain structure provides
a basis for a more thorough investigation of microstructural effects
on catalysis. For electrocatalysis in particular, recent advances
in scanning probe microscopy enable spatially resolved measurements
of catalytic activity with 10 nm resolution.53,54 Combining these measurements with TKD mapping could illuminate the
contributions of the grain structure to the activity in nanoparticle
electrocatalysts. More broadly, rapid characterization of the nanoparticle
grain structure could be used to establish robust correlations between
grain orientation, ρGB, and GB geometries for many
catalytic processes.

Conclusions
In summary, our studies
demonstrate the advantages of TKD for orientation
imaging and GB characterization of nanoparticles and nanowires. TKD
provides an accurate grain map that is in agreement with the results
of TEM-based diffraction techniques, as demonstrated by the analysis
of well-defined nanostructures. Furthermore, TKD is uniquely capable
of providing an interpretable grain map of highly polycrystalline
nanoparticles and samples with uneven thickness, characteristics that
are common in catalytic and other functional materials. These features,
combined with the wide accessibility, short acquisition times, and
low cost of SEM-based imaging techniques, motivate the broad use of
TKD for quantitative investigations into how grain structure influences
functional properties. The off-axis TKD methods used here are suitable
for mapping nanoparticles with dimensions on the order of tens of
nanometer or greater. However, the use of both improved detectors
and on-axis TKD with low probe currents could further decrease pixel
sizes below 2 nm, allowing for diffractive mapping of smaller and/or
finer-grained samples.55,56

Material Synthesis
Au nanoplates were synthesized using
an adapted templated colloidal method.57 Fifteen milligrams of sodium citrate was dissolved in 30 mL of DI
H2O and heated to 50 °C in a glass vial. A second
solution of 9.0 mg of NaAuCl4·2H2O and
55 mg of CTAB in 20 mL of DI H2O was heated to 50 °C
in a glass vial and added to the citrate solution while stirring.
The mixture was then heated at 82 °C for 20 min after which the
nanoplates precipitate as orange solids. For purification and removal
of the excess CTAB template, 50 mL of mixture was centrifuged at 4000
rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was drained, and the solids were resuspended
in 50 mL of DI water, followed by a second centrifugation at 4000
rpm for 30 min and resuspension in 5 mL of DI water to obtain Au nanoplates
suspended in H2O.

ZnO nanowire arrays were grown
by annealing Zn foil.44 Prior to use, the
Zn foil was etched in 10% w/w HCl solution for 30 s, followed by thorough
rinsing in deionized (DI) water. The etched Zn foil was then heated
in air within a box furnace at 400 °C for 1 h, followed by ambient
cooling to room temperature overnight.

ZnSe was prepared by
an adapted thermal evaporation method.47 ZnSe powder (0.25 g) was placed in a quartz
boat in the middle of a quartz tube in a tube furnace, while Si(100)
chips coated with 25 nm of Au (deposited at 0.2 nm/s within a Kurt
J. Lesker evaporator) were placed approximately 15 cm downstream.
The tube was evacuated with house vacuum for 5 min, placed under 1
atm of 100% H2 flowing at 200 sccm, and heated to 950 °C
for 2 h.

CuO nanowire arrays were grown by annealing Cu mesh.
Prior to use,
the Cu mesh was etched in 10% w/w HNO3 for 60 s, followed
by rinsing with DI water. The etched Cu mesh was then heated in air
within a box furnace at 500 °C for 1 h, followed by ambient cooling
to room temperature overnight.50 CuNW arrays
were made via the thermal reduction of the CuO nanowire arrays in
1 atm of H2 flowing at 100 sccm for 2 h at 200 °C.

Characterization
Samples were loaded onto Cu TEM grids
for both SEM/TKD and TEM/ACOM imaging. SEM imaging was performed on
an FEI Magellan 400 XHR SEM equipped with a Bruker eFlash-HR detector
and a UHR stage. Acquisition and analysis of TKD data were performed
with Esprit 2.1. The EBSD detector was mounted at ∼10.5°
detector tilt. Images were acquired at 20° sample tilt using
the TKD holder (Figure S1). Brandon’s
criterion (Δθ = 15° Σ–1/2)58 was used to classify GBs according
to CSL notation.

PED and ACOM-TEM imaging and analysis were
performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory using a Philips
CM300 TEM equipped with the ASTAR/DigiSTAR/TopSpin precession electron
diffraction (PED) orientation mapping system (equipped with a StingRay
F046B camera) from NanoMEGAS. The probe spot size was on the order
of ∼5 nm. For PED acquisition, four precessions/pixels and
a precession angle of 0.7° were used. Contrast in the ACOM diffraction
patterns shown in Figures 4 and 6 was enhanced for clarity in
the figures but not for analysis.

For TKD analysis, a blunt
1.8 cm 22-gauge needle cut from a standard
stainless steel needle was dipped in Ag epoxy and touched to the TEM
grid loaded with the sample to make contact. A small amount of Ag
epoxy was applied to the back using a second stainless steel needle.
The assembly was allowed to cure at 80 °C in a box furnace for
∼30 min. To image CuNWs, the grid was Ag epoxied to the needle
and cured before the samples were drop dried because of the air sensitivity
of Cu. The needle was carefully clamped onto a needle holder (Ted
Pella no. 15290) with a set screw, and the whole assembly was then
mounted onto a 45° 12.7 mm PELCO SEM holder for EBSD (Ted Pella
no. 15329). The needle holder was rotated until the surface of the
mounted Cu grid faced upward to minimize the number of scattered electrons
that landed onto the Cu grid on the way to the detector. Cu nanowire
samples were prepared for TEM imaging by swirling the Cu nanowire
array in deaerated IPA, following by drop drying onto TEM grids. ZnSe
and ZnO nanowire samples were collected for imaging by placing a small
piece of the product substrate in a Petri dish with IPA, swiping the
TEM grid across the sample, and allowing the grid to dry on filter
paper. During imaging, the lowest possible detector resolution and
acquisition times were iteratively determined. The detector was calibrated
on a small area containing the nanostructure to be imaged and in some
cases may not correspond perfectly to the true microscope normal.
Usage of low acquisition times reduced drift during map acquisition,
which generally improved the fidelity of the TKD maps to the SE image
taken just before mapping. TKD images have been cropped for clarity
to exclude background images of SEM vacuum or carbon support. The
total acquisition times, map sizes, and pixel counts refer to the
entire uncropped image.
