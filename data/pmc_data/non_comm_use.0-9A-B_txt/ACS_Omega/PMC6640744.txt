Titanium silicalite-1 (TS-1) with
little extraframework Ti was
hydrothermally synthesized in a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide system
using starch as the additive. The influences of the amount of starch
added on the coordination states of titanium ions and the functional
mechanism of starch were studied by various characterization means.
The addition of starch slowed the crystallization rate of TS-1 so
that the insertion rate of titanium to the framework matched well
with that of silicon. Therefore, the generation of extraframework
Ti, including the anatase TiO2 and octahedrally coordinated
titanium, was eliminated. The catalytic performances of the TS-1 samples
were evaluated in the epoxidation of 1-butene to produce butene oxide.
The catalytic activity of TS-1 was improved significantly due to the
increasing amount of framework Ti.

1 Introduction
Titanium
silicalite-1 (TS-1) with MFI topology was first hydrothermally
synthesized in 1983 by Taramasso et al.1 The titanium ions substitute isomorphously a small fraction of silicon
ions in the tetrahedrally coordinated sites in the silicalite-1 framework,
leading to some unique properties, such as a high hydrophobicity and
excellent catalytic performance for the selective oxidation reactions.
Over the past 3 decades, TS-1 has attracted much attention, and has
been widely studied, due to its excellent catalytic performances in
the epoxidation of alkenes,2−5 hydroxylation of aromatics,6−8 oxidation of
alkanes,9,10 ammoximation of ketones,11−13 and oxidative
desulfurization.14−17 The catalytic activity of TS-1 was primarily attributed to the tetrahedrally
coordinated Ti, which is called framework Ti.2 A higher framework Ti content usually has a higher catalytic activity.
However, the content of framework Ti is usually less than 2.5 mol
%,18 which is accounted for by the fact
that the ionic diameter of Ti4+ is larger than that of
Si4+, leading to the lattice expansion when titanium ions
are inserted into the framework.19,20 The excessive
Ti species in the synthesis system will be transformed to extraframework
Ti, including anatase TiO2 and octahedrally coordinated
Ti. The latter is taken as an inert component for the selective oxidation
in TS-1;21 however, in recent years, some
researchers have tried to prove that it is more active than tetrahedrally
coordinated Ti.22−24 It was reported that anatase TiO2 was
the catalyst for the inefficient decomposition of H2O2 and could cover the active centers in TS-1,25 which would be harmful to the catalytic oxidation. Thus,
the generation of anatase TiO2 should be restrained.

Nevertheless, increasing the content of framework Ti and inhibiting
the generation of extraframework Ti remain challenges for researchers.
At present, one of the effective pathways is matching the crystallization
rates of titanium and silicon sources. The crystallization rate of
titanium was reported to be higher than that of silicon;26 thus, reducing the rate of titanium or accelerating
that of silicon both benefited the incorporation of titanium into
the framework. Prasad et
al.27 introduced microwave heating into
the synthesis procedure for TS-1. The crystallization time of the
silicon source was shortened obviously. Therefore, more Ti ions were
inserted into the framework, and less extraframework Ti was generated
by this means. Huang et al.28 found that
ethanol could suppress the formation of extraframework Ti on addition
to the TS-1 synthesis gel after the evaporation of alcohol. Other
researchers also reported that the temperatures of evaporation and
crystallization had a crucial effect on the coordination states of
the titanium ions.29−31 Fan et al.32 used different
ammonium salts as crystallization-mediating agents to synthesize TS-1.
They found that the ammonium salts could not only drastically decrease
the pH of the synthesis gel and slow the crystallization process but
also modify the crystallization mechanism and make the incorporation
of titanium into the framework match well with that of silicon. As
a result, the formation of extraframework Ti was successfully eliminated.
However, the content of framework Ti was also reduced.33 Wang et al.10 proposed
a strategy to eliminate extraframework Ti, based on the combination
of liquid-phase and solid-phase transformation mechanisms. The anionic
polyelectrolyte, poly(acrylic acid), was used as the gelating agent
to prepare the solid/liquid mixture, which could partly convert the
liquid-phase precursor to the solid-phase precursor. Framework Ti
was formed by in situ conversion of the Ti species from the solid-phase
precursor during the crystallization stage, as well as by the transfer
of Ti species from the liquid-phase precursor to the solid crystal
after the crystallization. Some researchers have reported that sucrose
would be carbonized during the crystallization of TS-1 and release
hydrogen ions.34 Therefore, the pH of the
hydrothermal system was reduced, and the sucrose played a similar
role to that of the ammonium salts.

Starch is a kind of polysaccharide,
which has been used to synthesize
hierarchical zeolites.35 Because of the
micelles formed by starch, some mesopores are generated in the zeolites
with an MFI topology. However, the mesopores are primarily attributed
to the irregular intercrystal spaces. Furthermore, the effect
of starch on the coordination states of Ti has not been mentioned.

In the present article,
starch was introduced into the synthesis gel to assist in obtaining
TS-1 with a little extraframework Ti. The influence of the amount
of starch on the TS-1 properties was studied systematically. The functional
mechanism of starch was discussed accordingly. Compared to the TS-1
synthesized without starch, that obtained using this method has a
high content of framework Ti and quite a low content of extraframework
Ti. Therefore, it had a much higher catalytic activity for the epoxidation
of 1-butene.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (a) and crystallization curves (b)
of the TS-1 obtained with different amounts of starch. All of the
samples have five characteristic diffraction peaks of the MFI topology,
which are sited at 2θ values of 7.9, 8.8, 23.0, 23.9, and 24.4°,36 indicating that the addition of starch does
not change the topology of the zeolite. Furthermore, the relative
crystallinities, which were calculated by comparing the total intensities
of the three characteristic peaks in the 2θ range of 23–25°,
are similar in the five samples. This demonstrates that the crystallization
of TS-1 can be completed under these synthesis conditions. To investigate
the effects of starch on the crystallization process, we compared
the crystallization curve (relative crystallinity vs crystallization
time) of TS-1-0 to that of TS-1-0.4 (Figure 1b). It is clear that the relative crystallinity
of TS-1-0.4 is lower than that of TS-1-0 when the crystallization
time is shorter than 48 h, suggesting that the crystallization rate
of the former is lower than that of the latter. In other words, the
crystallization slowed when starch was introduced during the synthesis
process. Starch will generate a netlike structure in the aqueous solution.
This structure can separate the silicon and titanium sources into
small parts in the synthesis gel and hinder the combination of the
two sources. This may be one of the reasons for the lowering of crystallization
rate. On the other hand, some starch will be carbonized during the
hydrothermal process, releasing some hydrogen cations and reducing
the pH of the synthesis gel. The lower pH will also lead to a lower
crystallization rate, which may be beneficial to the insertion of
more titanium into the MFI framework due to the better-matched insertion
rates of silicon compared to those of titanium.32,34

with different amounts of starch.

Table 1 lists
the
pH’s of the synthesis gels before crystallization and those
of the mother liquors after crystallization. The pH of the gels on
adding starch is slightly lower than that without the addition of
starch, but they are similar. After crystallization for 72 h, the
pH of each obtained mother liquor is lower than that before crystallization.
However, the extents of decrease in the pH are distinct. Addition
of a higher amount of starch leads to a lower pH of the mother liquor.
This is due to the decomposition and carbonization of starch, releasing
H+ during the crystallization process. More starch can
release more H+ and thus cause a lower pH.

SEM and TEM images of TS-1
synthesized with different amounts of
starch are illustrated in Figure 2. From the SEM images of the samples, it can be seen
that the morphology of TS-1-0 is not uniform and the particle size
distribution is wide (from 50 to 250 nm). However, all samples synthesized
with the addition of starch show an approximately spheroidal morphology,
with a particle size of ∼150 nm. This phenomenon may also be
attributed to the netlike structure of starch, confining the growth
of small TS-1 particles, accompanied by the separation of large amounts
of silicon and titanium sources. The
external surface of the particles seems quite tough
because the particles are aggregates of small crystals, which can
be observed from the TEM images. A tough surface may expose more active
sites, and the intercrystal spaces may show a higher catalytic activity,
which would benefit the catalytic selective oxidation reactions.

Figure 2 SEM and
TEM images of TS-1 synthesized with different amounts of
starch.

FTIR spectra of TS-1 samples synthesized
with different amounts
of starch are shown in Figure 3. The bands at wavenumbers of 450 and 550 cm–1 are assigned to the Si–O bending mode and the stretching
vibration of structural double five-membered ring,
respectively.37−39 These two bands prove the formation of the MFI topology
in all samples, which is consistent with the XRD results in Figure 1. There is usually
an absorption band at 960 cm–1 in TS-1. The assignment
of this band is controversial. Bordiga et al.40,41 thought that it belonged to the stretching vibration of the Si–O
bond affected by the Ti ions in the neighborhood. However, it was
also assigned to the Si–OH bond on the surface or the defects
in the zeolites.42 Nevertheless, most researchers
believe that the appearance of the band at 960 cm–1 can be considered as indirect proof for the introduction of titanium
into the framework. It can be clearly seen from Figure 3 that all TS-1 samples show a band at 960
cm–1, suggesting the incorporation of Ti into the
framework.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra of TS-1 synthesized with different amounts of starch.

In the FTIR spectroscopy, the
relative intensities of the bands
at 960 and 800 cm–1 (I960/800) are often used to compare the relative contents of framework titanium
in different TS-1 samples.43 The I960/800 values of
the TS-1 samples, which are listed in Table 1, increase with an increase in the amount
of starch until m(St/SiO2) is 0.4, and
then, the values decrease slightly, indicating that the framework
Ti content increases first and then decreases. In other words, the
effect of starch on the framework Ti content presents a volcano curve.
Furthermore, the contents of framework Ti in the TS-1’s synthesized
with starch are all higher than those in TS-1-0. The highest I960/800 is obtained for TS-1-0.4, demonstrating
that the framework Ti content in TS-1-0.4 is the highest among all
samples. Because the catalytic oxidation performance of TS-1 is closely
related to the framework Ti content, TS-1-0.4 is expected to show
excellent catalytic activity for the epoxidation of 1-butene.

Table 1 also lists
the elemental compositions and n(Si/Ti) in TS-1 synthesized
with different amounts of starch. The feeding n(Si/Ti)
is 40. With an increase in the amount of starch added, the total content
of Ti species in TS-1 decreases first and then increases; therefore, n(Si/Ti) increases first and then decreases. The total content
of Ti is decided by the comprehensive function of the different coordinated
Ti species. Therefore, it is necessary to study the effect of starch
on the coordination states of titanium ions.

UV/vis spectroscopy
is one of the first techniques used for detecting
the coordination states of titanium ions in TS-1. There are mainly
three sets of absorption bands in the UV/vis spectrum of TS-1. The
band at ∼210 nm is due to the transition of the 2p electron of oxygen to the Ti4+ 3d orbit.44 This band suggests the existence of tetrahedrally
coordinated Ti, which is also called framework Ti. The contribution
of the wide band between 240 and 280 nm is controversial. Some researchers
believed that it belonged to the octahedrally coordinated Ti formed
by isolated [TiO4] or [HOTiO3] with two water
molecules,45,46 but some thought it was caused
by the condensation of hexahedrally coordinated Ti involving the Ti–O–Ti
bond.47,48 After studying the contribution of the band,
we found that there are at least two kinds of Ti species,33 one of which is the octahedrally coordinated
Ti and another, the pentahedrally coordinated Ti with quite a high
catalytic activity for selective oxidation. The band at 310–330
nm was attributed to anatase TiO2, the presence of which
would lead to ineffective decomposition of H2O2.25 Therefore, the formation of anatase
TiO2 should be restricted.

Figure 4 shows the
UV/vis spectra of TS-1 synthesized with different amounts of starch.
It is clear that the coordination states of the Ti ions in the samples
are affected by variation of the amount of starch added to the synthesis
gel, especially for extraframework Ti. An obvious absorption band
at ∼330 nm appears in TS-1-0, proving the existence of anatase
TiO2. However, the generation of anatase TiO2 was inhibited significantly by the addition of starch. The content
of anatase TiO2 shows an opposite trend to that of framework
Ti obtained from the FTIR spectra. It can also be seen that the content
of octahedrally coordinated Ti in TS-1-0.8 increases slightly, probably
due to the introduction of starch promoting the coordination saturation
of titanium ions. The spectra of all of the TS-1 samples have a band
at ∼210 nm, proving the existence of tetrahedrally coordinated
Ti in all of the samples. However, the quantitative analysis of Ti
with different coordination states by UV/vis is limited. Therefore,
we adopted UV–Raman spectroscopy.

Figure 4 UV/vis spectra of TS-1
synthesized with different amounts of starch.

UV–Raman resonance spectroscopy was first reported
by Li
et al.49 Using a UV excitation laser can
yield a stronger response and avoid fluorescence interference. Three
sets of UV excitation lasers with different wavelengths (244, 266,
and 325 nm) were used to examine the different coordination states
of titanium ions.

Figure 5 shows the
UV–Raman spectra of TS-1 samples synthesized with different
amounts of starch, excited by a 244 nm laser line. Tetrahedrally coordinated
framework titanium species were sensitive to this line. The strong
absorption bands sited at 490, 530, and 1125 cm–1 were assigned to the bending, symmetric stretching, and asymmetric
stretching vibrations of the Ti–O–Si species, respectively,
which were the direct proof of the existence of framework titanium.50 This is in accordance with the results of UV/vis
and FTIR spectra. All of the samples have an obvious absorption band
at 800 cm–1, which is the characteristic absorption
of the MFI topology. The intensities of the bands are similar, indicating
that the relative crystallinities of the samples are nearly the same,
which agrees with the XRD results.

Figure 5 UV–Raman spectra of TS-1 synthesized
with different amounts
of starch. The wavelength of the excitation light is 244 nm.

UV–Raman spectra of TS-1
synthesized with different amounts
of starch, excited by a 266 nm laser line, are shown in Figure 6. Octahedrally coordinated
titanium species are sensitive to this line.51 In the spectra, the band sited at 695 cm–1 is
assigned to the octahedrally coordinated titanium species, whereas
that at 800 cm–1 is attributed to the MFI topology.
The relative intensities of the bands at 695 and 800 cm–1 (I695/800) can be used for assessing
the content of octahedrally coordinated Ti, the data for which are
listed in Table 1. I695/800 decreases with an increase in the amount
of starch added until m(St/SiO2) reaches
0.4, and then, it increases gradually. This indicates that the addition
of starch can inhibit the generation of octahedrally coordinated titanium
at a low content but can also promote its generation at a high content.
This result coincides with that from the UV/vis spectra. The lowest
content of octahedrally coordinated titanium is obtained for TS-1-0.4.

Figure 6 UV–Raman
spectra of TS-1 synthesized with different amounts
of starch. The wavelength of the excitation light is 266 nm.

Anatase TiO2 is sensitive
to UV–Raman spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength of 325
nm. The bands sited at 144, 390, 516, and 637 cm–1 are attributed to anatase TiO2. From the UV–Raman
spectra of TS-1 synthesized with different amounts of starch (Figure 7), we can see that
a strong band at 144 cm–1 appears in the spectra
of TS-1-0 and TS-1-0.2, indicating the existence of anatase TiO2 in the two samples. However, the characteristic bands of
anatase TiO2 in the other samples are not clear. Thus,
another relative
intensity for the bands at 144 and 380 cm–1 (I144/380) was adopted (see Table 1). The band at 380 cm–1 is the characteristic band of the MFI topology, and I144/380 can yield the content of anatase TiO2.52 The results show that when m(St/SiO2) is higher than 0.4, the formation
of anatase TiO2 is significantly inhibited.

Figure 7 UV–Raman spectra
of TS-1 synthesized with different amounts
of starch. The wavelength of the excitation light is 325 nm.

The catalytic performances of
the TS-1 samples synthesized with
different amounts of starch were evaluated in the epoxidation of 1-butene
(see Table 2). The
conversions of H2O2 and turnover frequencies
(TOFs) over the samples synthesized with starch are all higher than
those over TS-1-0, indicating that the addition of starch is beneficial
to catalytic selective oxidation. Furthermore, the two parameters
reveal a similar trend to that of the content of tetrahedrally coordinated
Ti, given by FTIR and UV–Raman spectroscopies. Although the
total content of titanium in TS-1-0.4 is the lowest, the highest conversions
of H2O2 and TOF are obtained over it because
of the highest content of tetrahedrally coordinated Ti and lowest
content of extraframework Ti. The TOFs of TS-1-0.6 and TS-1-0.8 are
lower than those of TS-1-0.4, indicating that the catalytic activity
of the octahedrally coordinated Ti is absolutely lower than that of
the tetrahedral one. The selectivity of butene oxide (BO) decreases
with an increment in the content of octahedrally coordinated Ti. It
was reported that this Ti species could promote the solvolysis of
propene oxide in the epoxidation of propene.22 The utilization of H2O2 over TS-1 with an m(St/SiO2) of no less than 0.4 is obviously higher
than that of the other samples, mainly due to the elimination of anatase
TiO2 in the former. In summary, the coordination state
of Ti plays a more important role in the catalytic performance than
does the content of titanium.

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Synthesis of TS-1
The TS-1 samples
were synthesized in a tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) hydrothermal
system using tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) and tetrabutyl titanate
(TBOT) as silicon and titanium sources, respectively. The TEOS and
TBOT were hydrolyzed separately with TPAOH solution according to the
method described by Wang et al.53 Then,
the hydrolysates were mixed in a flask and heated at 363 K for 40
min to remove the alcohols. The molar composition of the gel was as
follows: n(SiO2)–n(TiO2)–n(TPAOH)−n(H2O) = 1:0.025:0.3:37. Powdered starch was dissolved
in distilled water to generate a starch sol (5 wt %). Different amounts
of starch sol were added to the above synthesis gel and stirred for
10 min before it was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave. The
weight ratio of starch to silica in the synthesis precursor (m(St/SiO2)) varied from 0 to 0.8. The precursor
was crystallized at 443 K for 72 h, and a white suspension was obtained.
The solid was separated from the suspension by centrifugation, dried
at 373 K for 10 h, and calcined at 833 K for 6 h. The TS-1 samples
obtained are denoted TS-1-x, where x stands for m(St/SiO2). For instance,
TS-1-0.3 is TS-1 synthesized by adding starch with an m(St/SiO2) of 0.3.

3.2 Characterization
of TS-1
X-ray powder
diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku Corporation SmartLab
9 X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. UV/vis diffused
reflectance spectra were recorded on a Jasco UV-550 spectrometer from
500 to 190 nm. Pure BaSO4 was adopted as a reference. Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were determined on a Bruker EQUINOX55
spectrometer from 4000 to 400 cm–1, and the KBr
pellet technique was used. The catalysts were viewed under a FEI QUANTA
450 scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a Tecnai G220
S-Twin transmission electron microscope. Ultraviolet resonance Raman
(UV–Raman) spectra were obtained on a DL-1 UV–Raman
spectrometer (Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics). The
continuous-wave UV laser sources are from a Coherent Innova 300 Fred
cw UV laser equipped with an intracavity frequency-doubling system,
using a β-barium borate crystal to produce second harmonic generation
outputs at different wavelengths of 244, 266, and 325 nm. A spectrograph
system was set up with a UV-sensitive charge-coupled device (Spex)
and a triplemate (1877D; Jobin Yvon-Spex). The elemental composition
was obtained on a PerkinElmer OPTIMA 2000DV ICP-OES. The molar ratio
of silicon to titanium (n(Si/Ti)) was calculated
according to the data from the ICP-OES.

3.3 Epoxidation
of 1-Butene
Epoxidation
of 1-butene was carried out in a stainless steel batch reactor (200
mL). The evaluation process involved feeding the synthesized TS-1
(0.1 g) and H2O2/methanol solution (1.0 mol
L–1, 34 mL) into the reactor and sealing the reactor.
1-Butene was then charged into the reactor at a pressure of 0.25 MPa.
After heating the substrates at 323 K for 1 h under magnetic stirring,
the reactor was cooled and the product was taken out. The residual
H2O2 in the product was measured by iodometric
titration. The organic products were analyzed by a Tianmei 7890F gas
chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary
column (PEG-20M, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm). The main
product is BO, and the byproducts are monomethyl ethers (MME) of BO
and butanediol (BD). The conversion of H2O2 (X(H2O2)), selectivity of BO (S(BO)), utilization of H2O2 (U(H2O2)), and TOF were calculated
according to eqs 1–4, respectively, as follows 1   2   3   4  where n0(H2O2) and n(H2O2) represent the initial and final molar
numbers of H2O2, respectively; n(BO), n(MME), and n(BD) represent
the molar numbers of
BO, MME, and BD, respectively; n(Ti) is the molar
number of Ti in TS-1, provided by ICP-OES; and t is
the reaction time, which is 1 h in this article.

4 Conclusions
TS-1 with little extraframework titanium species
has been successfully
synthesized with the assistance of starch in a TPAOH hydrothermal
system. The addition of starch can slow the crystallization so that
the crystallization rates of titanium and silicon match well. As a
result, the content of tetrahedrally coordinated titanium increases,
and the formation of anatase TiO2 is inhibited. The content
of octahedrally coordinated titanium decreased and then increased
with an increase in the amount of starch added.

TS-1 synthesized
with starch shows a higher catalytic activity
in the epoxidation of 1-butene than that synthesized without starch.
The highest catalytic activity is obtained for TS-1-0.4 due to the
highest content of tetrahedrally coordinated titanium and lowest anatase
TiO2 content and octahedrally coordinated titanium.
