Chitosan/poly[N-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)methacrylamide]/poly(acrylic
acid) (CS/PDMAPMA/PAA) composite nanogels (CPACNGs) were fabricated
in the solution of chitosan by surfactant-free emulsion polymerization. N-(3-(Dimethylamino)propyl)methacrylamide (DMAPMA) and acrylic
acid (AA) were initiated by 2,2′-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide
to graft from the backbone of chitosan. Nanogels were formed by noncovalent
forces, including of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and electrostatic
interaction. Nanogels were characterized by transmission electron
microscopy, scanning electron microscope dynamic light scattering,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
spectra, and 1H NMR. Spherical nanoparticles were observed
in the latex system. Nanogels exhibited an excellent CO2 responsivity and CO2/N2 reversible response
and switchability and had a faster response rate. The morphological
shape transformation of nanogels was modulated by bubbling with CO2 and N2. The responsive mechanism was explored
by determining the pH and electrical conductivity. In addition, nanogels
were successfully emulsified by bubbling with CO2, and
then a phase transition was achieved by bubbling with N2 in the organic solvent/water mixture.

1 Introduction
Over the years, stimulus-responsive
materials have received increasing
attention with a high potential value in many fields.1 Stimuli-responsive nanogels have rapidly developed for
potential applications, such as controlled release, oil recovery,
water treatment, and Pickering emulsion2,3 Under stimulation,
the chemical properties of these “smart” nanogels can
be reversibly altered by interactions between polymer chains and solvent
molecules, leading to significant phase-volume changes that make them
valuable switchable materials.3,4

The most widely
studied highly effective stimuli are temperature,
pH, and light.5−7 In particular, carbon dioxide (CO2)-responsive
materials were widely applied in CO2 capture and separation.8,9 CO2 is a weak gaseous acid that can interact with amidine,
amine, and carboxyl groups to change molecular hydrophilic or hydrophobic
properties.10−12

CO2-responsive polymers have been
used as a novel and
valuable type of stimuli-responsive polymer over recent years.13,14 They are a new type of polymer with reversible change of properties
after purging and releasing CO2. Compared with the traditional
triggers, such as pH, temperature, and light, CO2-responsive
polymers showed some unique advantages.15 For instance, they showed reversible responses via purging and releasing
CO2 without substance accumulation and could be repeated
in more responsive cycles with low sensitivity depletion.16 In addition, CO2-switchable latexes
could be reversibly coagulated by N2 bubbling and re-dispersed
by CO2 bubbling.17,18 CO2-controllable
responsive polymeric nanoparticles exhibit excellent thermal properties
and unique temperature/pH responsiveness as well as the ability to
switch CO2/N2, which has made them attractive
multifunctional polymer nanoparticles with wide application prospects.19

In recent years, a lot of natural polymers
have been used to fabricate
CO2-responsive shape memory hydrogels.20−22 Compared with
traditional shape memory hydrogels, CO2-responsive shape
memory hydrogels have many advantages. For example, after several
reversible cycles, the performance does not fade and there is no accumulation,
which has a great potential application.23

Previously reported systems based on synthetic polymer had
many
disadvantages, such as the use of a cross-linking agent and surfactant
in the preparation process, which limits their further application.
Chitosan is the only alkaline polysaccharide in nature that is rich
and easy to gain, renewable, naturally nontoxic, biodegradable, and
biocompatible. Chitosan contains a large amount of primary amine (−NH2) and is a potential candidate for CO2-responsive
polymers.24−27 Moreover, chitosan could be used as an emulsifying agent in the
surfactant-free emulsion polymerization process to ensure emulsion
stability in the preparation process. Chitosan (−NH2) exhibited a good CO2-responsive cross-linking/de-cross-linking
by purging/removing CO2 in the response process to achieve
the purpose of shape memory. There are a few studies on the preparation
of chitosan into a CO2-responsive shape memory.

In
the current paper, a new type of CO2-responsive composite
nanogel based on chitosan was fabricated. N-(3-(Dimethylamino)propyl)methacrylamide
(DMAPMA) and acrylic acid (AA) were functionally incorporated into
the nanogels of CS using CO2-responsive 2,2′-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide
(VA-044) as the initiator. CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite nanogels (CPACNGs)
were prepared by the self-assembly surfactant-free emulsion polymerization
in the chitosan solution (Scheme 1). Through noncovalent forces, such as hydrogen bond,
hydrophobic, and electrostatic interaction, physical cross-linking
is generated by the combination within chains. The effects of AA and
DMAPMA content on the stability of composite nanogels and their morphologies
were investigated to further explore their effects on the CO2 response performance. In addition, the responsive mechanism was
explored by determining the pH and electrical conductivity. Emulsification
and phase transition of nanogels were further investigated in the
organic solvent/water mixture.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation and Characterization of Nanogels
(CPACNGs)
In the current paper, monomers AA and DMAPMA were
initiated by VA-044 to fabricate CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite nanogels
(CPACNGs) in the chitosan solution. CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite nanogels
were formed by the physical and chemical cross-linking among CS, AA,
and DMAPMA. Table 1 shows that composite nanogels (CPACNGs) were prepared by varying
the concentration of monomers in the chitosan solution.

a Note: Composite nanogels (CPACNGs)
were prepared by varying the concentration of monomers (i.e., DMAPMA
and AA) in the chitosan solution.

The amino groups (−NH2) on the backbone
of chitosan
have a high reactivity to form a chitosan-based grafting copolymer.28 As shown in Scheme 1, the initiator VA-044 generates an activated
free radical on the amino group (−NH2) of chitosan
and then introduces monomers AA and DMAPMA grafting from the main
chain of chitosan. In general, latex was commonly prepared by emulsion
polymerization. Chitosan with a hydrophobic backbone chain and hydrophilic
side group was used as an emulsifier in the surfactant-free emulsion
polymerization process.29 Therefore, chitosan
is beneficial for the formation of nanogels and makes the latex more
stable due to its emulsifier properties. Then, DMAPMA can be protonated
under acidic conditions. Combining DMAPMA and AA into the nanogels
of CS can form physical cross-linking through noncovalent forces,
such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic
piles, and electrostatic interactions, and through association within
and between chains to form a semi-interpenetrating polymer network
(semi-IPN).30

In the present paper,
composite nanogels (CPACNGs) were characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope
(SEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer spectra (FTIR), and 1H NMR. As shown in Figure 1, in the FTIR spectrum of composite nanogels (CPACNGs),
the characteristic peak (C=O) occurred at 1740 cm–1, −COOH of PAA occurred at 1462 cm–1, C–N
occurred at 1261 cm–1, and the characteristic peaks
occurred at 2800–3000 cm–1 for −CH2 and −CH3.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of chitosan and CPACNGs6-3.

As shown in Figure 2, 1H NMR (D2O/trifluoroacetic
acid-d) (95:5, v/v) of CPACNGs: δ = 0.68 ppm
(−CH3 of PDMAPMA), 1.6–1.93 ppm (−CH2–
of PDMAPMA and PAA), 1.95 ppm (−COCH3 of CS), 2.55
ppm (−N(CH3)2 of PDMAPMA), 3.01 ppm (CH
of CS), 3.05–3.21 ppm (CH2 of PDMAPMA), 3.44–4.00
ppm (CH and CH2 of CS), 4.70 ppm (CH of CS). Compared with
the 1H NMR spectrum of CS, CPACNGs showed new proton peaks,
which were attributed to PDMAPMA and PAA.

of (a) chitosan and (b) CPACNGs6-3.

The morphology of the CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite
nanogels was investigated
by SEM (Figure 3).
CPACNGs were spherical nanoparticles with a diameter of 100 nm. The
TEM image revealed that most nanogels with a diameter of about 100
nm were of uniform size and gathered together, and a few nanogels
with a diameter of about 200 nm were also observed (Figure 4).

Figure 3 SEM images of CPACNGs6-3.

Figure 4 TEM images of CPACNGs6-3.

The size distribution and zeta potential of CPACNGs6-3
were measured
by DLS. The DLS results showed a large number of nanogels in the diameter
peaks at 272 nm with a width of 22 nm (Figure 5). The zeta-potential results are shown in Figure 6. The zeta potential
of CPACNGs6-3 is 59 mV with a width of 7 mV. It was reported that
the larger the absolute value of the zeta potential, the greater the
repulsive force between colloids than the attractive force.31 The data of DLS revealed that the latex of composite
nanogels was stable and uniform in size in the present system, and
the surface of composite nanogels carried a large of positive charges.

Figure 6 Zeta-potential distribution of CPACNGs6-3.

The XPS of CPACNGs is shown in Figure 7. It can be found that the
carbon spectrum
is an asymmetrical peak (C 1s), that is, 286.35, 284.88, and 284.355
eV. The peak of 284.355 eV is attributed to sp2 C–C
in the nanogels, the peak of 284.88 eV is attributed to the carbon
atom in sp3 C–C in the nanogels, and the peak of
286.35 eV is attributed to a small number of carbon atoms of C=O.
The nitrogen spectrum (N 1s) was also fitted to the following three
peaks: 399.1, 399.7, and 400.35 eV. The peak of 399.1 and 399.1 eV
is assigned to −NR–C=O and R–NH–R
from PDMAPMA. The peak of 400.35 eV is attributed to the nitrogen
atom in the amino groups (−NH2) from the chitosan.
The oxygen spectrum was similarly fitted to the following peak at
531.6 eV. This peak is assigned to the oxygen atom in C=O.

2.2 CO2-Responsivity of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
Composite Nanogels (CPACNGs)
In the current paper, the mass
ratio of chitosan to monomers influencing the CO2-response
performances of nanogels was studied. The effect of the DMAPMA monomer
quantity on the response performance was investigated, as shown in Figure 8a. CPACNGs5-2, CPACNGs6-2,
and CPACNGs7-2 were prepared by varying the mass of DMAPMA and keeping
the contents of AA. As shown in Figure 8a, when CPACNGs5-2 and CPACNGs6-2 were prepared at
a low concentration of DMAPMA, the nanogels exhibited an excellent
CO2 responsivity. However, CPACNGs7-2 was prepared at a
higher concentration of DMAPMA and noticeable CO2 responsivity
cannot be observed.

the weight
ratio of DMAPMA to AA [(a)5:2, 6:2, 7:2 and (b) 6:1, 6:2, 6:3] by
passing CO2.

Figure 8a shows
that another monomer, AA, also influenced the CO2 responsivity
of composite nanogels. CPACNGs6-1, CPACNGs6-2, and CPACNGs6-3 were
prepared by varying the mass of AA and keeping the contents of DMAPMA.
The nanogels exhibited an excellent CO2 responsivity when
CPACNGs6-2 and CPACNGs6-3 were prepared at a higher concentration
of AA.

CPACNGs5-2, CPACNGs6-2, and CPACNGs6-3 have more complete
response
and a faster response rate. CPACNGs5-2 reaches the response equilibrium
within 3 min. CPACNGs6-2 reaches the response balance in about 4 min.
CPACNGs6-3 reaches the response balance in about 2 min, which is an
improvement compared with our previous work, a response balance of
about 5 min, indicating that the physically cross-linking CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
composite nanogels have a faster response rate and better reversible
response effect.

CPACNGs5-2, CPACNGs6-2, and CPACNGs6-3 also
have good reversible
responsiveness (Figure 9). The reversibility of the response with CO2 treatment
was further examined to explore if the gas-switchable process could
be reversed by purging the system with inert gas N2. The
gas-replacement process was repeated by gas aeration for 3 cycles
in the order “CO2 → N2 →
CO2 → N2 → CO2 →N2”. As shown in Figure 9, multi-cycling CO2 and N2 aeration
was carried out for 3 cycles, and no loss in the gas responsivity
was observed. The result demonstrated that nanogels have a good reversibility
by multi-cycling CO2 and N2 aeration.

of DMAPMA to AA (DMAPMA: AA (m/m) = 5:2, 6:2, and 6:3, respectively)
by 3 cycles passing CO2/N2.

Figure 10 shows
the appearance of the nanogels latex after CO2 and N2 treatment. The original nanogels latex (left) was creamy
white. After purging with CO2 (middle) for 10 min, the
creamy white latex became clear gradually. The nanogels latex remained
as a stable dispersion after being treated with CO2, and
particle coagulation was not observed. A turbidity measurement confirmed
the optical changes. The transmittance of the original nanogels latex
was 6.58%. After purging with CO2 for 10 min, the transmittance
increased to 91.49%. After purging with N2 for 20 min,
the system was returned to the original latex state (right) and the
transmittance decreased to 12.12%.

Figure 10 Appearance of the CPACNGs6-3 latex after
CO2 and N2 treatment (left: original nanogels
latex, middle: purging
with CO2 for 10 min, right: purging with N2 for
20 min).

From the SEM image, the morphology of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
composite
nanogels before and after CO2/N2 treatment was
observed (Figure 11). Figure 11a shows
that the nanogels are spherical nanoparticles with a diameter of 50
nm. After purging with CO2 for 5 min, the morphology of
the nanogels changed dramatically (Figure 11b). The regular sphere was destroyed and
became an irregular microstructure. This could be attributable to
chitosan (−NH2) reacting with CO2 in
the presence of water to form carbamate, which acted as cross-linking
points to cause the association of the chitosan chains.32 Meanwhile, the tertiary amine groups of PDMAPMA,
the carboxyl groups of PAA, and a large number of initiator residues,
including imidazole groups presented in the structure of nanogels,
were easily protonated/unprotonated by CO2 in an aqueous
solution.33−36 In order to balance the osmotic pressure generated by the charges,
water molecules swelled into the nanogels network, which reduced the
system’s light-scattering index and led to the creamy-to-transparent
conversion. Thus, optical changes in the nanogels suspension took
place via the CO2-responsive behavior.

Figure 11 SEM images of CPACNGs6-3:
(a) original state, (b) CO2 treatment for 5 min, (c) N2 treatment for 20 min.

Figure 11c shows
that the morphology of the nanogels was returned to original spherical
nanoparticles after purging with N2 for 20 min. It was
clear that the morphology of the nanogels returned to its original
state. It was hypothesized that the dissolved CO2 molecules
could be easily washed off by N2 bubbling to recover the
original state of the nanogels. The results indicated that the nanogels
had a good morphological switchability by CO2 and N2 bubbling.

Figure 12 shows
that the transmittances of the nanogels system were treated by bubbling
CO2 for different times. When bubbling CO2 for
30 s, the transmittance of the nanogels suspension increased slowly.
Subsequently, it was rapidly increased within 1 min. It reached the
equilibrium by bubbling CO2 for 2 min. This was result
to the initial reaction of chitosan chain (−NH2)
with carbon dioxide leading to the aggregation of nanogels. When CO2 was further introduced, the transmittance increased rapidly,
because the nanogels expanded rapidly. Then it reached the equilibrium
of swelling gradually.

2.3 Effect of the CO2-Responsive Process
on the pH Value of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA Composite Nanogels
Figure 13 shows that the
pH of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite nanogels latex was influenced in the
process of CO2 injection at a constant rate of 16 mL/min.
At the beginning, the pH value of the original latex was determined
as 7.3. When CO2 was injected within 0.5 min, the pH value
decreased rapidly and was determined to be 6.2. Afterward, the pH
value decreased slowly. After 2 min, the pH value remained basically
unchanged, indicating that the response balance was achieved, and
the pH value remained basically unchanged after CO2 was
continuously injected. When N2 was introduced, the nanogels
system returns to its original state, and the pH value was 7.3, which
is consistent with the pH value of the original latex. Figure 14 shows that the pH value of
the nanogels system did not change by multi-cycling CO2 and N2 aeration, which further indicates that the response
behavior of nanogels was reversible.

Figure 13 pH of the CPACNGs6-3 latex by CO2 treatment.

Figure 14 pH of the CPACNGs6-3 latex by CO2 and N2 treatment.

The nanogels consisted of CS, PDMAPMA, and PAA.
CS and PDMAPMA
contained the free amino groups, and PAA contained the carboxyl groups.
All these functional groups were considered CO2-responsive
groups and were introduced into the skeleton of the polymers to fabricate
CO2-responsive composite materials.16 The pKa of PDMAPMA, CS, and
PAA were 8.8, 5.5–6.5, and 4.5, respectively. At pH 7.3, the
amino groups of PDMAPMA should be protonated before the CO2 addition. Meanwhile, the carboxylate groups from PAA should not
be protonated at a pH of 6.2. Therefore, when the pH decreased from
7.3 to about 6.2 by CO2 injection, it was attributed to
the presence of the free amino groups from CS in the nanogels. In
addition, it cannot be ignored that the free amino groups reacted
with CO2 to form carbamate in the presence of water.32

2.4 Effect of the CO2-Responsive Process
on the Conductivity of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA Composite Nanogels
CO2 or N2 was injected into the CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
composite nanogels suspension in the order “CO2 →
N2 → CO2 → N2 →
CO2 →N2” at a constant
rate of 16 mL/min, and the conductivity was measured at room temperature.
The conductivity of the nanogels suspension depends on the ionic strength.
The dielectric constant of the CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite nanogels suspension
was studied to detect the change in ionic strength during CO2 and N2 cycling. Figure 15a shows that the conductivity of the nanogels suspension
was increased gradually by CO2 injection within 2 min.
It can be found that the conductivity remains unchanged after 2 min.
When the nanogels suspension was increased gradually by CO2 injection, this rule of the change in conductivity was in accordance
with that of pH.

Figure 15 Conductivity of the CPACNGs6-3 latex by CO2 (a) and
N2 (b) treatment.

Afterward, N2 gas was infused to the
nanogels suspension
treated by CO2. Figure 15b shows that the conductivity was first decreased and
was then increased with the passage of N2 gas. Because
CO2 in the nanogels system is easy to be driven out by
N2, it results in the decrease of its charged particles. Figure 16 shows the change
of conductivity in the 3 cycling of CO2/N2,
and the results further indicate that the nanogels system has good
reversibility.

of gas aeration,
in the order “CO2→ N2 →CO2→ N2 →CO2→ N2”.

2.5 Emulsification and Phase Transition of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
Composite Nanogels in the Organic Solvent/Water Mixture
Figure 17 shows the CO2/N2 switching emulsification performance of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
composite nanogels in the mixture 1:4 (v/v) of n-hexane
to nanogels system. When n-hexane was added into
the nanogels system and was shook, the mixture was divided into 2
layers, consisting of the transparent n-hexane solution
in the upper layer and the suspension in the lower layer (Figure 17a,b). Subsequently,
when CO2 was injected into the mixture, the mixture became
transparent, and the n-hexane solution was still
in the upper layer, while the nanogels suspension responded to CO2 gas in the lower layer (Figure 17c). The amino groups of nanogels were protonated
by CO2 bubbling in water and increased the hydrophilicity
of nanogels. The latex became a transparent solution. The whole mixture
was shook and then became an unlayered suspension (Figure 17d). On further infusing N2 gas, the nanogels suspension divided into a white suspension
in the upper layer and a transparent solution in the lower layer (Figure 17e). After bubbling
N2, CO2 was driven out of the mixture, and nanogels
gradually acquired a hydrophobic state, allowing it to disperse in
the oil phase, that is, n-hexane. The results indicated
that nanogels were successfully emulsified by bubbling with CO2, and then a phase transition was achieved by bubbling with
N2 in the n-hexane/water mixture.

Figure 17 Phase transition
of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA nanogels in the mixture (1:4,
v/v) of n-hexane to latex (a) before shaking, (b)
after shaking, (c) after CO2 bubbling, (d) after shaking,
and (e) after N2 bubbling.

The experimental results show that CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
composite nanogels
have a good switching emulsification performance of CO2/N2, and the system is expected to have a great application
prospect in the field of oil and water separation, drug carrier, and
so on. In addition, it also proves once again that the proposed response
mechanism is correct, providing a theoretical basis for the further
development of new intelligent CO2 materials in the future.

3 Conclusions
In the current work, chitosan-based
nanogels, consisting of chitosan
(CS), PDMAPMA, and PAA, were successfully prepared by surfactant-free
emulsion polymerization. Composite nanogels exhibited an excellent
stimuli responsivity, and their microstructures were controlled by
the addition or removal of CO2 as an external stimulus.
The nanogels had a good morphological switchability by the CO2-responsive cross-linking/de-crosslinking of chitosan (−NH2) and the protonation/deprotonation of other CO2-responsive groups in aqueous solutions. Emulsification and phase
transition of nanogels were achieved in the organic solvent/water
mixture by cycling of CO2 and N2 bubbling. It
is expected that chitosan-based composite nanogels have broad application
prospects as intelligent devices, biosensors, CO2-adsorbent
materials, and drug carriers.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
DMAPMA (98%, Aldrich),
chitosan (CS, 95%, Sangon Biotech), AA (99%, Sinopharm Group), 2,2′-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide
(VA-044, AR, Aldrich), and acetic acid (AA, 99.5%, Shanghai Chemical
Industry) were used as received. Other chemical reagents were of analytical
grade and were used as received. Distilled water was used in the present
experiment. CO2 and N2 gases were controlled
by LZB-3WB flow meters to maintain a constant gas flow of 16 mL/min.

4.2 Preparation of Chitosan/Poly[DMAPMA/Poly(acrylic
acid)(CS/PDMAPMA/PAA) Composite Nanogels (CPACNGs)
0.25 g
CS was dispersed in 50 mL 0.6% of acetic acid solution under stirring
at room temperature, until dissolved completely. CS/PDMAPMA/PAA composite
nanogels with different compositions were prepared by surfactant-free
emulsion polymerization using 2,2′-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide
(VA-044) as the initiator.

50 mL chitosan solution and 0.7 mL
DMAPMA were added into a 100 mL three-neck flask. The reactor was
magnetically stirred at 300 rpm and purged with nitrogen for 5 times.
Then, VA-04 solution (50 mg/1 mL) was injected into the reactor until
the reactor was gradually heated to 60 °C. 0.8 mL of monomer
(i.e., DMAPMA) and 0.15 mL of monomer (i.e., AA) was dissolved in
9.7 mL of water prior to the preparation of 10 mL mixture solution
of monomers. After stirring for 2 h, 10 mL mixture solution of DMAPMA
and AA was added dropwise within 25 min. Subsequently, the polymerization
was continuously carried out for 5 h. The reaction was stopped by
exposing the latex to air and cooling down to room temperature, and
the creamy-white latex was obtained. The powder was obtained by centrifugation
at 9000 rpm on the centrifuge (TGL-20M, Changsha Pingfan Instrument
Co. Ltd.) for 5 min and dried under vacuum at room temperature for
3 days.

4.3 Characterization
CPACNGs powder was
combined with KBr crystals and was then pressed into a pellet. FTIR
was recorded by an FTIR spectrometer (VERTEX 70, Bruker, Switzerland)
and scanned from 4000 to 400 cm–1. CPACNGs powder
was dissolved in the mixed solvent (D2O/trifluoroacetic
acid-d) (95:5, v/v) at 25 °C to prepare the
sample for the measurement of 1H NMR spectra. 1H NMR spectra were performed at 500 MHz using an AVANCE III 500 spectrometer
(Brucker). The surface electronic state of CPACNGs was determined
by XPS (PHI-5702). The original latex was diluted 15 times to prepare
the sample for the measurement of SEM, TEM, and DLS. The morphology
of CPACNGs was observed by SEM (JSM-6701F, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
TEM was performed on a JEM-1200EX microscope (Japan Electron Optics
Lab. Co. Ltd. (JEOL), Tokyo, Japan). The size distribution and zeta
potential were measured by DLS (Mastersizer 3000).

4.4 CO2 Responsivity Tests of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
Composite Nanogels (CPACNGs)
6 mL CPACNGs latex was moved
into the CO2-response device. The nanogels latex was purged
by CO2/N2 gas in the order “CO2 → N2 →CO2 → N2 → CO2 → N2” at a constant
flow rate of 16 mL/min for 3 cycles. CO2 and N2 gas aeration was continued for 10 and 20 min, respectively. Then,
the transmittance of the nanogels suspension was recorded at 550 nm
by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-2012PC/PCS). The conductivity
of the nanogels latex was recorded by a conduct meter (DDS-11A). The
pH of the nanogels suspension was recorded by a digital pH meter (PHS-25).

4.5 Test of Emulsifying Properties of CS/PDMAPMA/PAA
Composite Nanogels (CPACNGs)
4 mL CPACNGs latex was mixed
in 1 mL n-hexane. Phase separation was observed in
the bottle. After purging CO2 at a constant rate of 16
mL/min for 5 min, the change of suspension was recorded with a camera.
Then, N2 was purged at a constant rate of 16 mL/min for
a continuous time of 20 min, and the change of suspension was recorded
with a camera.
