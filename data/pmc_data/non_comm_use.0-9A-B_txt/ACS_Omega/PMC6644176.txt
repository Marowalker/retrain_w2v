The aim of this work
is to develop a biobased functional reactive
diluent for thermosetting epoxy resins suitable for high-performance
applications. An advanced organosilicon-grafted cardanol novolac epoxy
resin (SCNER) was synthesized from cardanol novolac epoxy resin and
heptamethyltrisiloxane. After the chemical structure of SCNER was
identified by Fourier transform infrared, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR, it was used to modify the diglycidyl ether of the
bisphenol A (DGEBA)/methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride system. The
SCNER showed unique advantages, reducing the viscosity of DGEBA and
improving the properties of the cured resin. With 10 wt % SCNER, the
cured resin exhibited a higher tensile strength (78.84 MPa) and impact
strength (32.36 kJ·m–2). The single glass transition
temperature (Tg) step proved the homogeneous
phase structure of the cured resin. Inevitably, the Tg of the cured resin decreased for the addition of SCNER.
The dynamic mechanical analysis results indicated that the storage
modulus of the cured resin decreased with the increasing content of
SCNER. The morphology showing the ductile fracture of the cured resin
was testified by scanning electron microscopy. The dilution and toughening
properties of SCNER paves the way to a wide range of possible “eco-friendly”
applications, especially in the fields of coatings, paintings, and
adhesives.

1 Introduction
Epoxy
resins are widely used in coatings, adhesives, castings,
reinforced composites, and electronic industries because of their
outstanding mechanical and electrical properties, excellent chemical
resistance, good adhesion, and low minimal shrinkage.1−4 However, one of the major disadvantages of epoxy resins is the high
viscosity at room temperature that causes poor processability to limit
the applications.5,6 The main approach to overcome
the crucial issue of high viscosity is to add diluents into the epoxy
resin.7

Generally, reactive diluents
are low-viscosity compounds with multiple
reactive functionalities that have good compatibility with epoxy resins.
As it was well known, the reactive diluents could reduce the viscosity
of epoxy resin systems markedly to improve the curing reaction process,8,9 and participate in the curing reaction to improve the mechanical
and thermal properties of cured epoxy resins.10,11 Because of fossil fuel shortage and environmental crisis, the biomass-based
chemicals from renewable resources became a global research interesting.
Reactive diluents derived from renewable resources would be promised
to replace the petrochemicals and fabricate green materials.12,13 Therefore, efforts have been made to develop biobased reactive diluents
in order to obtain easily operated low-toxicity epoxy resins based
on the fundamental of “green chemistry”.

Cardanol
is a natural phenol compound with an unsaturated C15 alkane
side chain containing 1, 2, or 3 nonconjugated C=C
bonds at the meta position.14,15 It could be obtained
extensively via the distillation of cashew nut shell liquid and regarded
as a valuable renewable resource.16 Cardanol
had been widely applied in many areas, such as coatings,17−19 adhesives,20−23 plasticizers,24 and biocomposites.25−28 The cardanol-based epoxy resins could be prepared either from epoxidation
of unsaturated alkyl groups or phenolic hydroxy groups.29−33 Moreover, in our previous work, we synthesized a lignin and cardanol-based
novolac epoxy resin by reacting epichlorohydrin (ECH) with the mixture
of lignin and cardanol novolac resin.34 However, the organosilicon-containing cardanol epoxide has not been
investigated.

In view of the defects of epoxy resin, combined
with the unique
properties of organosiloxanes, we envisage the synthesis of a low-viscosity,
bifunctional biomass-based toughening reactive diluent. Thus, a novel
biobased organosilicon-grafted cardanol novolac epoxy resin (SCNER)
was prepared and used as reactive diluent and toughening agent to
modify the anhydride-cured epoxy resin system. The results showed
that SCNER had an outstanding dilution and toughening effect on the
anhydride-cured epoxy resin system.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of SCNER
SCNER was
prepared by the epoxidation of cardanol-based phenolic resin, and
further hydrosilation of double bonds on the cardanol side chain (Scheme 1). The chemical structure
of SCNER was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The FTIR spectra
of SCNER and cardanol are shown in Figure 1. The absorption bands at 1259 and 1050 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of SCNER were the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching peaks of C–O–C and O–Si–O.
The bands at 1600 and 1591 cm–1 were assigned to
the vibration absorption of the aromatic ring. The cluster peak assigned
at 2927 and 2854 cm–1 were the stretching peak of
C–H bonds. Compared with the FTIR spectrum of cardanol, the
characteristic peak of the epoxy group at 912 cm–1 appeared and the peak of the OH group at 3320 cm–1 disappeared, which indicated that the OH group of cardanol reacted
with ECH completely.35,36 The peak of C=C–H at 3015 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum of
cardanol disappeared and a new peak of the Si–O–C group
could be found at 834 cm–1, which meant that the
double bonds on the side chain of cardanol had been functionalized
by heptamethyltrisiloxane (HMTS).

(b).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of SCNER and SCNER-Modified
Epoxy Thermoset
Figure 2 displays
the 1H NMR spectra of cardanol and SCNER. The multiplet
peaks in the range of 6.78–7.28 ppm were assigned to the protons
in the aromatic ring. Compared to the spectrum of cardanol (Figure 2a), the peaks at
5.15–5.22 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum of SCNER (Figure 2b) almost disappeared.
These peaks were attributed to the protons of −CH=CH– and −OH. This variation implied that the phenolic hydroxyl groups and unsaturated
double bonds on the side chain were converted. Meanwhile, the peaks
at around 3.30 and 2.73 ppm corresponded to methine and methylene
protons of the oxirane ring, respectively. The peak at 4.18 ppm was
due to the presence of methoxy protons.37 The multiplet peaks around 0.11 ppm assigned to the Si–CH3 protons supported the occurrence of hydrosilylation
reaction.38 The peaks at 49.81 and 44.24
ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of SCNER (Figure 3b) were attributed to the carbons
in the epoxy group. The peak at 68.25 ppm was assigned to the −OCH2 carbons on the benzene ring. The aromatic carbons gave peaks
at around 120–150 ppm. The NMR data further indicated that
the SCNER had been successfully synthesized.

2.2 Effect of SCNER Content on the Viscosity of
the Epoxy Resin
The viscosity of the epoxy resin with different
contents of SCNER was investigated and the results are displayed in Figure 4. It was shown that
the viscosity of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) was rapidly
decreased with the increase of SCNER content. The results indicated
that SCNER was compatible with DGEBA and could efficiently reduce
the viscosity of DGEBA.

DGEBA at 25 °C.

2.3 Mechanical Properties
The reinforcing
and toughening effects of the incorporated SCNER into this curing
system were investigated by impact, tensile, and bending tests. The
results are shown in Table 1. It can be observed that the impact strength increased first
and then decreased with the incorporation of SCNER. A thermoset with
10.0 wt % SCNER loadings shows the best toughening effect and the
impact strength of the cured resin reaches 32.36 kJ·m–2, which is almost twice higher than that of neat epoxy (15.43 kJ·m–2). Meanwhile, tensile test results showed that the
tensile strength and break elongation also increased after adding
SCNER. The tensile strength and break elongation of the cured resin
with 10.0 wt % SCNER loadings reach 78.84MPa and 3.52% respectively,
which were 26.3% increase in tensile strength and 43.7% increase in
break elongation with respect to those of neat epoxy. Such a result
shows that SCNER could effectively toughen the DGEBA/methylhexahydrophthalic
anhydride (MeHHPA) system. Such an efficient toughening effect could
be attributed to the specific structure of SCNER with a rigid aromatic
core, flexible aliphatic chain, and organosilane chain. In addition,
the flexural strength gradually decreased with increasing SCNER content.
This is because the cross-link density of the cured resin was reduced
with incorporation of SCNER, which was also reflected in the reduced Tg.

2.4 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis of Cured Resins
Dynamic
mechanical behaviors of neat DGEBA and DGEBA/SCNER resins
were investigated, as shown in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5a, the G′ of the cured resin
was affected by the addition of SCNER. The modulus of cured resins
was decreased with the addition of SCNER moderately. It is well-known
that G′ in the glassy state is affected synthetically
by chemical structure and chain packing.39,40 On one hand, SCNER with soft long alkyl chain and organosiloxane
structures could decrease the stiffness of the resins. On the other
hand, SCNER could increase the distance of resin chains and make the
resin segment easy to move. Therefore, it was also indicated that
the toughness of the cured resin was enhanced with the increase of
the content of SCNER.

Figure 5 Dynamic mechanical spectra of cured resins with SCNER:
(a) G′ and (b) tan δ.

Figure 5b shows
that each sample had one narrow and smooth α-relaxation peak.
The peak of the tan δ versus temperature is taken as glass-transition
temperature (Tg). As shown in Figure 5b, the Tg of cured epoxy resins was decreased by the addition
of SCNER into the epoxy resin lowered. The SCNER possessed a relatively
low epoxy value to reduce the cross-linking density of cured epoxy
resins, to reduce the Tg of the cured
epoxy resins. The low Tg of DGEBA/SCNER
resins might also result from the flexible linkage of the C15 alkyl chain and the Si–O– group in the backbone of
the resins. Moreover, for DGEBA/SCNER resins, incorporating SCNER
into the cured epoxy resin could result in epoxy compounds with bulk
pendants. The bulk pendants might simultaneously increase the free
volume and reduce the cross-linking density of the cured resins, to
reduce the Tg of the resins.41,42 The variation of Tg could also be confirmed
by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis results (Figure S1). However, there was a gap of Tg between dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA)
and DSC analysis results because of the difference test principle
and mechanism of these two equipment.

2.5 Fracture
Surface Morphology
The morphology
of the fracture surface of neat DGEBA and DGEBA/SCNER resins with
different contents of SCNER to DGEBA by weight 0, 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0%
was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Figure 6. The cured neat
DGEBA exhibited a characteristic smooth fracture surface without deformation,
which was consistent with the low impact strength. After the addition
of SCNER, the original smooth surfaces of the cured resin became rougher
and appeared to have many ridges (referring to the filar strips).
This change meant energy dissipation and improved toughness of the
epoxy-SCNER resins (Figure 6b–d). Furthermore, with the increase of content of
SCNER, the rough and irregular cracks started to turn into the tear
of large areas gradually. The size and depth of these tearing areas
were related to the energy required to destroy the cured resin, which
corresponded to the impact strength results. As shown in Figure 6b–d, only
few holes could be observed after the addition of SCNER, which indicated
no phase separation in the epoxy-SCNER system. It was in good agreement
with DMA detection results.

3 Conclusions
Cardanol is a natural phenol
compound, which has an unsaturated
C15 alkane side chain with 1–3 double bonds at the
meta position. Because of this versatile chemical structure, the manufacturing
of novolac epoxy resin from cardanol (CNERs) has received much attention
from the researchers in recent years. Usually, the high viscosity
of CNERs restricted the application of them as diluents. In this work,
we reported a novel low-viscosity modified CNER from the hydrosilation
of the double bonds in the side chain of CNER. The obtained SCNER
could be utilized as reactive diluent and toughener. Therefore, we
further investigated the properties of SCNER in the modification of
the epoxy/anhydride system. Owing to the unique structure of SCNER,
it could be easily dispersed in epoxy resin and efficiently toughen
the cured resin. The results showed the impact strength of the cured
resin with 10.0 wt % SCNER reached 32.36 kJ·m–2, which is almost two times higher than that of neat epoxy (15.43
kJ·m–2). Furthermore, the introducing of SCNER
into the epoxy matrix could simultaneously enhance the tensile strength
and break elongation of the cured resin. The efficient diluent coming
from low-cost, renewable cardanol has considerable potential for epoxy
thermosets with high performance.

4 Experimental
Procedures
4.1 Materials
Cardanol (average molecular
weight 300 g/mol) was supplied by Zaozhuang Nate Biological Materials
Co. Ltd. (Shandong, China); ECH was purchased from Nanjing Haolifeng
Chemical Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China). DGEBA [epoxy equivalent weight
(EEW) = 196 g/equiv] was obtained from Jiaxing Lianxin Chemical New
Materials Co. Ltd. (Zhejiang, China), N,N-dimethylbenzylamine (DMBA) was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), MeHHPA was provided by Jiaxing Lianxin
Chemical New Materials Co. Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). Karstedt catalyst,
HMTS, benzyltriethylammonium chloride (BTEAC), and other chemicals
were analytical grade and obtained commercially from Sinopharm Chemical
Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

4.2 Synthesis
of CNER
CNER was synthesized
by cardanol reacting with formaldehyde and ECH according to the previous
procedure.34,43,44 Typically, cardanol (150.0 g, 0.50 mol) and oxalic acid (1.53 g,
0.017 mol) were mixed in a 2000 mL four-necked round bottom flask
equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a spherical condenser, a constant
pressure dropping funnel, and a thermometer. The system was preheated
at 100 °C under the protection of nitrogen. Subsequently, 37%
aqueous solution of formaldehyde (20.4 g, 0.25 mol) was added dropwise
in 1 h. After reacting for 3 h under nitrogen atmosphere, the traces
of water and acid catalyst were removed by raising the temperature
to 115 °C. ECH (462.5 g, 5.0 mol) and BTEAC (1.5 g, 6.6 ×
10–3 mol) were added into the above product under
constant stirring. The system was heated to 100 °C and maintained
for 4 h, and then cooled down to 60 °C. NaOH (0.53 mol, 21.2
g) was added five times in 2 h. The mixture was stirred for another
2 h at 60 °C and thereafter washed with hot water several times
to remove the byproduct (NaCl). The organic phase was collected and
distilled in vacuum to recycle the excess amount of ECH. CNER could
be obtained as a reddish-brown viscous liquid with a yield of 87.3%.

4.3 Synthesis of SCNER
SCNER was prepared
from CNER with HMTS by a method similar to that given in previous
literature.45,46 Into a 250 mL flask were added
CNER (71.2, 0.2 mol), HMTS (71.04 g, 0.32 mmol), and Karstedt’s
catalyst (40 mg/kg platinum relative to CNER); then the mixture was
heated to 110 °C and reacted for 6 h. The mixture was cooled
to 80 °C. Activated carbon (2.2 g) was added to the mixture and
reacted for another 1 h. The solution was then cooled to room temperature
and filtered to remove the solids. The filtrate was distilled under
reduced pressure and SCNER was obtained with 67.73% yield. Scheme 1 shows the preparation
of SCNER.

4.4 Preparation of Cured Epoxy Resins
DGEBA (100 phr), SCNER with varying contents (5–25 phr), and
DMBA (2.5 phr) were mixed together, and then MeHHPA with stoichiometric
amounts corresponding to epoxy equivalents was added. The above system
was fully mixed and then left in vacuum to remove any entrapped air
bubbles at 80 °C. The homogeneous mixture was poured into greased
poly(tetrafluoroethylene) molds to cure at 100 °C for 3.0 h,
followed by post curing reaction at 130 °C for 8 h in a vacuum
oven. The mold was cooled and the casting was finally released from
the mold for further characterization.

4.5 Characterization
The FTIR spectra
were obtained from a Nicolet IS10 spectrometer (Nicolet, USA) using
attenuated total reflectance mode. All spectra were based on 32 scans
with 2 cm–1 resolution across a wavenumber interval
between 4000 and 500 cm–1. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 300 MHz NMR spectrometer
(Bruker, Germany) using tetramethylsilane as an internal and deuterated
chloroform (CDCl3) as solvent.

The epoxy value and
viscosity measurements of SCNER were determined according to Chinese
National Standards GB/T 1677-2008 and GB/T 22314-2008, respectively.
The EEW of SCNER was 1234.5 g/equiv, and the viscosity of SCNER was
83.2 mPa·s at 25 °C.

The impact testing was carried
out according to China National
Standards GB/T 1043-2008 using a XJJY-5 impact test machine (Chengde,
China). The tensile strength and flexural strength were measured by
an XJZ-50 electronic universal testing machine (Shenzhen Skyan Power
Equipment Co., China) according to China National Standard CB/T 1040.1-2006
and CB/T 9341-2000, respectively.

DMA was carried out with a
DMA Q800 dynamic mechanical thermal
analyzer (TA Instruments, USA). Specimens were studied with dual cantilever
geometry model in a frequency of 1 Hz and heated from 30 to 200 °C
at a heating rate of 3 °C·min–1. The S-3400N scanning electron microcopy (Hitachi,
Japan) was adopted to observe the fracture surface of specimens after
the impact test.
