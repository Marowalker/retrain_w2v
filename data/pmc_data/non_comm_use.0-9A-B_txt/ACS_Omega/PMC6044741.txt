Retinoic acid-related
orphan receptor γt (RORγt) has
a vital role in the differentiation of T-helper 17 (TH17) cells. Potent
and specific RORγt inverse agonists are sought for treating
TH17-related diseases such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and
type 1 diabetes. Here, the aim was to discover novel RORγt ligands
using both standard molecular docking and negative image-based screening.
Interestingly, both of these in silico techniques put forward mostly
the same compounds for experimental testing. In total, 11 of the 34
molecules purchased for testing were verified as RORγt inverse
agonists, thus making the effective hit rate 32%. The pIC50 values for the compounds varied from 4.9 (11 μM) to 6.2 (590
nM). Importantly, the fact that the verified hits represent four different
cores highlights the structural diversity of the RORγt inverse
agonism and the ability of the applied screening methodologies to
facilitate much-desired scaffold hopping for drug design.

Introduction
Retinoic acid receptor-related
orphan receptor γt (RORγt; Figure 1) is a nuclear receptor
expressed mainly in the thymus.1 It is
essential for the differentiation of proinflammatory CD4 + T-helper
17 (Th17) cells producing interleukin 17 (IL-17).2 Normally, IL-17 expression is increased in response to
pathogenic bacteria and fungi on mucous membranes, but its elevated
production is also connected to inflammatory and autoimmune conditions
such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.3 Accordingly, RORγt is an attractive drug
target for autoimmune diseases.4,5 RORγt is isoform
2 of the RORC gene (UniProt: P51449-2), and it is almost identical
to isoform 1 RORγ (UniProt: P51449-1) that has a longer N-terminus.
Isoform 1 drives androgen receptor expression, and thus, it is also
a target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.6 Because of the similarity between the isoforms, the RORγt
abbreviation refers to both isoforms from here on.

novel inverse agonist 9 (stick model with magenta backbone)
is shown compared against the negative image. (E) log P values, ranging from 0.5 to 7.5 (listed 15.11.2017 in the ChEMBL32) indicate that lipophilicity is required for
potency (pIC50 of 3.8–8.9; blue dots). The new inverse
agonists follow the same logic (red dots; Table S1). 3QQ (log P = 2.3; pIC50 =
6.7), and compound 9 discovered in this study (log P = 3.9; pIC50 = 6.2) are circled with green
and magenta, respectively.

Thus far, a wide variety of RORγt inverse agonists
have emerged.7−19 Moreover, Vitae Pharma’s VTP-43742 (acquired by Allergan
plc) has reached phase II trials for the treatment of psoriasis. Importantly,
there are 70 X-ray crystal structures of RORγt in both ligand-free
and ligand-bound states (3QQ in Figure 1A–C), providing atomistic insight. In the inverse
agonist structures (e.g. PDB: 3L0L; 5APH; 4QM0),20−22 the side chains of His479 and
Tyr502 are hydrogen bonding (Figure 1C)—an interaction missing from bound full agonist
RORγt structures (e.g. PDB: 5M96).23

The ligand-binding cavity of RORγt is highly lipophilic as
indicated by its neutral negative image (Figure 1D). The lipophilicity is projected on its
known ligands (Figure 1E). In fact, a high log P value seems to be needed
to elicit activity (Figure 1E). Although this level of ligand neutrality is typical for
nuclear receptors, the opposite is true for targets such as ionotropic
glutamate receptors with extracellular binding sites.24−26 Despite the cavity’s lipophilicity, it contains some polar
residues. For example, Arg367 at the sulfate pocket donates a hydrogen
bond (H-Bond) to several potent RORγt ligands (Figure 1C; PDB: 4WLB).

In the structure-based
drug design, the target protein three-dimensional
(3D) structure is used in developing novel drug candidates. The compounds
are either designed de novo or screened virtually using computer-aided
drug discovery methods before the in vitro testing. Molecular docking
mimics flexibly the molecular recognition process between the ligand
and its receptor. Despite its widespread use, docking and its rescoring
and postprocessing methodologies have case-specific success rates.27−29 With some targets, the
predicted activities correlate well with the experimental data,30 whereas with others they clearly do not.31 Agonists, a novel virtual screening (VS) or
docking methodology called negative image-based (NIB) screening,33 were applied here in addition to the standard
docking routine.34,35

To Improve the Chances
of Discovering Novel RORγt Inverse
In NIB screening,
a negative image (Figure 1D) is built of the target protein’s
ligand-binding cavity (Figure 1B) using a specific cavity detection algorithm PANTHER.33 Next, a set of ligand 3D conformers are generated
and compared directly against the cavity-based NIB model using a similarity
algorithm ShaEP.36 On the basis of the
shape/electrostatic complementarity of the NIB model and the ligand
3D conformers, the best similarity matches are ranked the highest.
This methodology has been shown to function with a wide variety of
target proteins such as nuclear receptors and 17β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase 1 where ligand-binding cavities are lipophilic.30,37 Recently, the NIB methodology was shown to improve docking performance
by rescoring explicit docking solutions.38 Furthermore, PANTHER has been used to analyze different ligand-binding
cavities for drug discovery purposes.39,40

The
goal of the study was to discover new RORγt ligands using two
different VS techniques that would complement each other in the process.
Interestingly, both standard docking and NIB screening put forward
mostly the same compounds for experimental testing. Compound selection
did not rely solely on the scoring or energy assessment of the software,
but docking poses were also inspected critically before their purchase.
Altogether, 34 VS hits were purchased and 11 of them were determined
to be RORγt inverse agonists with pIC50 values ranging
from 4.9 (11 μM) to 6.2 (590 nM). Accordingly, testing produced
an effective hit rate of 32%—a result that proves that both
of the employed VS methodologies were effective and on an equal footing.
Moreover, the discovered compounds represent altogether four structural
cores capable of evoking RORγt inverse agonism.

This study
expands tangibly the assortment of inverse agonists
for RORγt by utilizing two different VS or docking methodologies
and human reporter cell-based assay. Understanding the flexibility
and druggability of the receptor’s active site is vital for
unlocking the therapeutic potential of RORγt in autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis.

Results and Discussion
Employing Two VS Approaches
Structure-based
VS was
performed against commercial compound library specs containing >100 000
molecules to discover novel RORγt ligands for experimental testing.
VS was performed using two methodologies: (1) molecular docking with
GLIDE standard precision(SP)41 in Maestro
and (2) NIB screening with PANTHER/ShaEP-based protocol.33 Prior to executing VS, both methods were validated
with experimental RORγt data (199 active ligands; obtained 1st
of June 2015) included in the ChEMBL database.32 On the basis of the benchmarking with the known active
compounds, the early enrichment was excellent for GLIDE SP (Figure S1A) and weaker for NIB screening (Figure S1B). Notably, NIB screening was able
to pick all active compounds with pIC50 > 7.5 before
10%
of the decoys had been screened—a crucial task in which GLIDE
slightly failed. The hit candidates discovered using the VS assays
were acquired from the specs and analyzed in vitro.

Molecular Docking:
Scoring Validation and VS
Docking
of the known active ligands with GLIDE SP did not produce high correlation
coefficient against the prior experimental data (R2 = 0.23). On the one hand, the lack of correlation could
be explained by the heterogeneous nature of the dataset originating
from several laboratories. On the other hand, the success rates and
accuracy of the docking algorithms themselves are case-specific and
vary accordingly.27−29 However, a large portion of ligands with pIC50 > 7.5 could be effectively separated from those with
lower
activity by GLIDE scoring (Figure 2A). For example, if the docking energy value of −11.6
kcal/mol was used as a cutoff, more than 10% of ligands (N = 20) out of 33 highly active ligands (pIC50 > 7.5)
could
be identified (61%), thus skipping the less active compounds altogether.

Figure 2 Scoring
validation and pharmacophore filtering. (A) In vitro data
(x-axis = pIC50) compared to the docking
energy (kcal/mol; y-axis) with 199 actives from ChEMBL.
(B) Heat map shows that GLIDE docking recognizes potent ligands as
their energies fall between −11.6 and −11.4 (N = 20). (C) In vitro data (x-axis: pIC50) set against the ShaEP similarity score (y-axis). Most of the actives are separated (similarity ≥0.67)
from the rest of the compounds by NIB screening. (D) When at least
10% of actives were found (N ≥ 20), the heat
map shows that the highly active molecules would be discovered with
the similarity score of 0.67 using NIB. (E) Several potent inverse
agonists H-bond with Arg367 at the sulfate pocket (3QQ in Figure 1A–C) and,
thus, a pharmacophore point was used to filter out compounds (stick
model with red backbone) unable to make the interaction from NIB screening
results. 9 (ball-and-stick model with green backbone)
is forming the H-bond based on NIB screening.

The best enrichment (eq 1) for the separation between the potent ligands (pIC50 ≥ x but always >6.0) and less active
ligands
(pIC50 < x) is shown in the heat plot
(Figure 2B: if only
active ones were obtained, value is set to 150). The plot indicates
that the GLIDE energy of −11.6 kcal/mol was the most efficient
result but also −11.4 and −11.5 kcal/mol could generate
>80 enrichment. In general, when the energy was ≤−10.5
kcal/mol, the enrichment remained high. Hence, a cutoff value of −11.4
kcal/mol was used with docking.

Docking of 121 294 molecules,
including tautomers and protonation
states, yielded 46 molecules with docking energy <−11.4
kcal/mol; from these 24 formed at least one H-bond with the RORγt
(G in Table S1). Table S1 shows the log P values, docking scoring
values, pIC50 values, and the methodology upon which compound
selection was based.

Negative Image-Based Screening: Scoring Validation
and VS
Because the correlation coefficient for GLIDE docking
was weak
with the known RORγt ligands, NIB screening was also employed
to the task. This alternative docking approach produced a modest coefficient
(R2 = 0.27; Figure 2C) that was marginally higher than the one
provided by GLIDE (R2 = 0.23). Again,
the most potent ligands formed a cluster that could guide the selection
process. Note that the enrichment produced by NIB (Figures 2D and S1B) was weaker than that of GLIDE (Figures 2B and S1A). In
practice, this suggests that NIB screening is more likely to promote
testing of false positives than GLIDE docking. On the basis of the
heat plot (Figure 2D), the reasonable cutoff similarity value with NIB would be 0.67,
but to remain on the safe side, 0.60 was used instead.

NIB screening
of 121 294 molecules yielded 1302 molecules with a similarity
value ≥0.67 and 5424 molecules with a value ≥ 0.60.
A pharmacophore point (Figure 2E) was used to filter the initial NIB screening results—a
process that decreased the number of compounds to 123. The pharmacophore
expects polar interaction between the compound (oxygen, nitrogen,
fluorine, and chlorine) and the side chain of Arg367 at the sulfate
pocket (e.g. 3QQ in Figure 1C). This interaction is expected to improve the binding affinity,
but it is not a prerequisite for RORγt binding. When those molecules
with unrealistic van der Waals overlap with the protein’s main-chain
atoms were also removed, 34 compounds remained. Importantly,
22 of them were the same as the ones put forward by GLIDE docking
(GP in Table S1). Furthermore, 10 additional
molecules were selected for testing (P or (G)P in Table S1), from which three had GLIDE docking energy below
−10.5 kcal/mol ((G)P in Table S1).

The VS hit compounds are divided into four subsets (subsets
I–IV
in Table S1). This division is explained
more thoroughly with the predicted ligand-binding modes (see below).

VS Yields Effective Hit Rate of 32%
The IC50 value
of the most potent compound 9 (pIC50 = 6.2; Table S1) was determined to be
in the nanomolar range (587 nM; Table S1) based on the experimental testing. Most of the remaining compounds
fell into the micromolar range with values between the first and the
second concentration on the dilution series (Table S1). The less active molecules were given values outside the
dilution series, and thus, these numbers should be considered as approximate
results only. The IC50 value of ursolic acid was determined
to be 112 nM based on the average of two control measurements. For
comparison, this result for the control is well in line with the previously
measured IC50 values.42 The
somewhat lackluster potency is stereotypical for pure VS-based drug
discovery projects, in which the most promising hit compounds are
not refined further under the systematic organic synthesis programme.
Nevertheless, the effective hit rate of the screening was 32%—a
clear indication that the applied VS assays were able to pick RORγt
inverse agonists from the vast compound library with confidence.

Four Cores Producing Inverse Agonism
The tested 34
molecules were divided into subsets I–IV (Table S1) based on their structural cores for detailed structure–activity
relationship (SAR) analysis (Figures 3, S2 and S4). Both VS methods
produced similar binding poses for the compounds, and accordingly,
the SAR analysis focuses only on the poses outputted by NIB screening.
Pan assay interference (PAINS) filtering indicates that compounds 1–10 as well as 14, 16, 31, and 34 belong potentially to the PAINS category,
which could reduce their applicability as drugs.

Figure 3 RORγt binding modes
of inverse agonists from subsets I and
II. The binding suggested by NIB screening for the subset I compounds
(A) 1, (B) 2, and (C) 9 and
subset II compounds (D) 14, (E) 15, and
(F) 11. The key residues are shown as sticks (orange
backbone), and the cavity’s negative image is shown as a transparent
surface. The ligands are expected to occupy space next to His479 (cyan
backbone) because it controls agonism vs inverse agonism. The H-bonds
are shown as dotted lines between polar atoms. The two-dimensional
(2D) representations are shown below. The binding modes of 12 and 13, included in subset II (Table S1; Figure S2), are shown
in Figure S3.

Subset I
The second largest set of molecules (1–10 in Table S1) contains
a thiobarbituric acid-moiety, making them reactive and, consequently,
not optimal for pharmaceutical purposes. Compounds 1, 2, and 9 were found active (Figure 3A–C; Table S1). Although both 1 and 2 extend from the vicinity of Arg367 to the area next to His479 and
Tyr502 inside the cavity (Figure 3A,B), only 9 produces a tight fit with
the cavity facing Arg367 (Figure 3C). However, 9 does not extend into all
of the subcavities (Figure 3C). The rest of the compounds (3–8 and 10 in Table S1) were found inactive. Supporting Information Figures S2 and S3 contain,
respectively, the 2D representations and predicted binding poses for
all of the inactive compounds.

Subset II
A set
of seven [4-(phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-(2-phenyl-4-quinolyl)methanone
derivatives were tested for RORγt activity (11–17 in Table S1; Figures 3D–F and S2). Compounds 16 and 17 were either insoluble
or inactive (Table S1; Figures S2 and S3). The activities of 14, 15, and 11 (Figure 3D–F) are roughly at the same level
(IC50: 2.0–2.2 μM; Table S1). Tyr502 forms an H-bond with the methoxy of 11 (Figure 3F); meanwhile, 14 and 15 H-bond with Arg367 (Figure 3D,E), although the angles are
less than optimal. The bromine of 15 improves the binding
by filling the hydrophobic cavity end formed by Tyr369, Val376, and
Phe401 (Figure 3E).
The two less active molecules 12 and 13 (Table S1; Figures S2 and S3) have a CF3 group that aligns favorably next
to the side chain of Arg367 (Figure S3);
however, both of them align poorly next to Tyr502 (Figure S3). For example, 13 protrudes a hydrophobic
methyl group into a subcavity that would be optimal for an H-bond
acceptor (Figure S3). The inactivity of 17 results from the fact that its fluorine moiety cannot extend
near Arg367; furthermore, its methyl group cannot fit next to Tyr502
(Figures S2 and S3). In short, the subset
II core is an excellent fit for the cavity, but none of the compounds
had all three groups—nitro, bromine, and methoxy—at
the optimal positions.

Subset III
Compounds 18–21 (Figures S2 and S4A,B), housing a four-ring
system, were selected for testing by both in silico assays (Table S1). The hydrophobic system is a good fit
with the cavity controlling the agonism versus inverse agonism function
of RORγt (Figures S3 and S4A,B).
Furthermore, both 18 and 19 accept a hydrogen
from the main chain nitrogen of Glu379 (Figure S4A,B), which ensures activity (Table S1). In contrast, 20 and 21 cannot secure
the same H-bond using their nitro- and acid-groups without compromising
the favorable binding interactions elsewhere in the cavity (Figure S3). This renders 20 and 21 inactive in testing (Table S1).

Subset IV
Compound 34 (Figure S4C) was not a preferred choice for the activity testing
based on scoring (Table S1; Figure S6), although it could not extend to the
vicinity of His479 and Tyr502 in the cavity (Figure S4C). Nevertheless, 34 was selected because of
its ability to H-bond with and fill the cavity near Arg367. The placement
of the two bromines was predicted to be enough to force the protein
into the inverse agonist conformation (Figure S4C). Although the in vitro testing verified this hypothesis
(Table S1), 34 is not a particularly
potent inverse agonist (pIC50 = 5.0 μM). The other
compounds included in this largest subset (23–33 in Table S1; Figures S2 and S5) were inactive.

Conclusions
VS
identified 11 hits out of 34 experimentally tested compounds,
thus yielding a hit rate of 32% (Table S1). Nine hits were identified by both standard molecular docking and
NIB screening. Moreover, two compounds were discovered using only
NIB screening. NIB screening results were refined using pharmacophore
filtering (Figure 2E). The fact that both VS methodologies could discover mostly the
same inverse agonists is encouraging because NIB screening is considerably
faster than standard molecular docking algorithms. Accordingly, NIB
screening is a suitable method for screening RORγt inverse agonists
especially when considering its computational costs. The most potent
hit (9 in Table S1 and Figure 3C) was nearly correctly
scored and predicted by both the VS assays. However, the binding favorability
of the other hits was clearly overestimated by both the methods (Table S1). As a result of this study, the diversity
of novel RORγt inverse agonists is expanded substantially because
of the discovery of four new structural cores.

Materials and Methods
Ligand
Preparation
The Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry
System (SMILES) strings of ligands (Supporting Information) were converted to 3D structures, including possible
tautomers and protonization states, with LigPrep in Maestro 2015-1
(Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2017) with an enhanced
planarity option at pH 7.4 ± 0.0 by using Merck molecular force
field 94 (MMFF94).43 For rigid docking
purposes, multiple low-energy conformations were generated with ConfGen.44

Compounds for Screening Method Validation
Validated
ligands for RORγt were retrieved from the ChEMBL32 from 502 IC50 results for human RORγt
(obtained 9th of June 2015), 199 had been reported active, and thus
these compounds were used to validate the VS assays. When several
activity measurements were available for the same compound, the one
suggested as best was used. The activity data were converted into
pIC50 (−log(IC50)).

Compounds for
VS
A commercially available compound
collection specs (Specs, The Netherlands; www.specs.net; 10 mg compound library
05/2014) was used. Modified drug-like options were used, where the
molecular weight was set to 250 < MW < 600 and the number of
rotatable bonds was set to a maximum of 6. The latter option was set
to speed up the VS and to enhance the probability that the identified
ligands would be selective for the target. Furthermore, because the
existing high-affinity RORγt ligands are highly lipophilic (Figure 1B), only molecules
with log P ≥ 7.0 were removed. In total, the
used VS library consists of 116 495 molecules or 121 294
when including tautomers and different protonation states.

Protein
Structure Preparation
At the time of performing
the VS assays (5/2015), there were 12 structures available for RORγt
at the Protein Data Bank.45 Because our
aim was to identify (agonist/inverse agonist) ligands for RORγt,
a high-resolution structure (1.7 Å) for RORγt with bound
partial inverse agonist was selected (PDB; 4WLB(46)). All of
the available structures were tested initially for the VS use (data
not shown); however, 4WLB was found to produce the best results in the benchmarking. The same
protein structure was used both in PANTHER/ShaEP-based NIB screening33 and GLIDE-based docking.41 In both cases, the protein preparation Wizard included
in Maestro 2015-1 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, USA, 2017)
was employed with the following options: (1) import and process: delete
waters, preprocess; (2) review and modify: delete chain B, C, E, delete
A: TLA602, TLA603 (tartaric acids); and (3) refine: use PROPKA pH:
7.4, optimize.

Molecular Docking
Molecular docking
of the small molecules
was performed using GLIDE in Maestro with SP. The centroid coordinates
of the partial inverse agonist bound in the target protein structure
(3QQ in Figure 1A–C;
PDB: 4WLB) were
used as the binding site center in the docking. A radius of 10 Å
was used in grid generation. As stated above, a number of alternative
ligand conformers were generated to improve the docking sampling.

Negative Image-Based Screening
The NIB model consisting
of optimally positioned polar and neutral cavity filling atoms (Figure 1D) was produced using
PANTHER.33 The NIB model was compared against
multiple low-energy ligand 3D conformations (compound 9 vs NIB model in Figure 1D) using similarity comparison algorithm ShaEP.36 While GLIDE typically rejects molecules that
overlap with the protein, ShaEP imposes only a marginal penalty for
such overlaps during the similarity comparison. Accordingly, both
docking methods should identify compounds that fit perfectly (a very
rare occurrence) but behave in a markedly different way if the space
available for the binding is exceeded. Mainly, the NIB screening provides
more flexibility to ligand–receptor complex formation, and
GLIDE-based docking is more likely to discard compounds because of
minor coordinate overlaps with the protein.

VS Efficiency
To estimate the validity of the generated
NIB models and molecular docking settings, several strategies were
employed. First, the correlation coefficients were used for docking
scoring values against experimental pIC50 values. Second,
the pIC50 and GLIDE docking energy (kcal/mol) or ShaEP
similarity values in Figure 2 were used to generate representative heat plots using gnuplot-5.0
(www.gnuplot.info). Heat
plots were used to visualize the efficiency of the used method to
separate those active ligands that have a pIC50 value above
the given value from those below the same value, for example, how
well the known ligands with pIC50 above 7.0 are recognized
over those with pIC50 below 7.0. For heat maps, the enrichment
(eq 1) was calculated
with the increment of 0.1 from pIC50 6.0, until the number
of the active ligands in the given threshold value was below 10.0. 1  where
NaG = number of ligands with ≤
GLIDE docking energy and above pIC50, Na = total number
of ligands above pIC50, NiG = number of ligands with ≤
GLIDE docking energy and below pIC50, and Ni = total number
of ligands below pIC50.

Pharmacophore Filtering
To improve the NIB screening
yield, a carefully selected 1 Å-radius pharmacophore filter point
was used (Figure 2E).
Only those docked molecules that formed polar interactions with the
receptor and did not have hydrophobic groups in the proximity to the
NH1 atom of the Arg367 side chain were selected. The guanidinium group
acts as a H-bond donor for many RORγt high-affinity ligands
(e.g. 3QQ in Figure 1C) and, accordingly, it was chosen for postprocessing or filtering
using the soon-to-be-published in-house algorithm SDFCONF (Lätti
et al. manuscript in preparation).

PAINS Filtering
PAINS compounds filtering was performed
by the PAINS3 filter (or A filter) in Canvas module in Maestro 9.
The filtering suggests that compounds 1–10 (=
subset I) as well as 14, 16, 31, and 34 belong potentially to the PAINS category. This
suggests that roughly half of the compounds could be promiscuous and
require further experimental testing and/or modification before they
could be used as RORγt inverse agonists or as drug candidates
for any other target.

Experimental Testing
The activity
of the 34 selected
molecules (Table S1) was determined at
5 μM concentration using the Human RAR-related Orphan Receptor
Gamma Reporter Assay System in a 96-well format (Indigo Biosciences,
PA, USA). The assay utilizes human reporter cells designed to express
high levels of human RORγ hybrids of both isoforms 1 and 2,
capable of quantifying inverse agonism and agonism. The assay was
performed as a two data point analysis, and 11 molecules exhibiting
the strongest activity were selected for further analysis. The same
kit was used to determine the IC50 values for the most
promising molecules. The dilution series protocol of the kit for the
final concentrations was followed. The concentrations of the tested
molecules ranged from 6 μM to 8 nM in 1/3-fold decrements, and
each concentration was measured three times. In addition, the maximum
signal was determined as 0 nM concentration, and the minimum signal
was measured from the wells lacking cells. Luminescence was measured
with VICTOR X4 Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer, MA, USA) using
luminometry technology. Before reading the plate, 5 s plate shake
was performed as instructed and each well was then read after >5
min
incubation for 0.5 s based on counts/s label.

The results were
normalized using GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software, Inc., CA,
USA). On the basis of the results, the maximal signal of 0 nM concentration
was determined to be reached at 10–9 M because of
the fact that all of the measured molecules reached approximately
the maximal signal already at the previous dilution. The minimum signal
was reached either at 10–4 or 10–3 M concentration depending on the behavior of the molecule on the
dilution series. The goal was rather to underestimate than overestimate
the potency of each molecule. The normalized results were fitted on
a curve with nonlinear regression using the equation for −log[inhibitor]
versus response in GraphPad Prism (Figure S6), and the IC50 values were determined/approximated based
on this curve fit (Table S1). Because most
of the active compounds found in this study were in the proximity
of the maximal tested concentration, the sigmoidal curve fit is not
optimal. As described in the analysis kit, ursolic acid was used as
a control molecule for the experiment, and its IC50 value
was determined twice during the course of the experiment. Because
the curve fit of ursolic acid reached the top and bottom plateaus
already on the dilution series, there was no need to approximate the
top and bottom concentrations and those were left out when analyzing
ursolic acid.

Figure Preparation
Figures 1A–D and 2E
were prepared using BODIL47 and VMD 1.9.2.48Figures 3A–D and S3–S5 were
prepared using BODIL, MolScript2.1.220449 and Raster3D 3.0.2.50 BIOVIA Draw 16.1
(San Diego: Dassault Systèmes, 2017) was used to generate 2D
representations in Figures 3, S2, and S4. The area under curve
(AUC) values and the early enrichment values were calculated with
Rocker0.1.4.51 The enrichment factors were
calculated as true positive rates when 1% of the decoy molecules (here
the entire specs compound set) have been found. The standard deviation
for the AUC is acquired with the derived error for the Wilcoxon statistic.52
