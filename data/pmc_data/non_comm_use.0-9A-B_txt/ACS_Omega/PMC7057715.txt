A combination of ruthenium catalyst with silver salt
and copper
salt was proved to be a highly efficient protocol for the direct addition
reaction of benzoic acids with unsymmetrical trifluoromethylated internal
alkynes. Diverse trifluoromethyl group-substituted (E)-enol esters were readily obtained for a broad substrate scope in
moderate to good yields with excellent regio- and stereoselectivities
under mild reaction conditions.

Introduction
Enol esters represent a kind of important
and versatile synthon,
which have broad applications in both organic synthesis and polymer
as well as material science.1 Among the
numerous synthetic methods toward such kind of valuable compounds,
the direct addition of carboxylic acids to alkynes constitutes one
of the most straightforward and atom-economical approaches without
generation of byproduct or waste.2 Consequently,
substantial attention has been attracted from the synthetic community
and a diverse set of different catalytic systems has been well established
by the employment of various typical transition-metal catalysts, including
Ru,3 Rh,4 Ir,5 Pd,6 Au,7 Ag,8 Re,9 Co,10 Cu,11 Hg,12 etc. Undoubtedly,
ruthenium complexes turned out to be the most extensively utilized
catalyst due to the high catalytic efficiency and relatively low cost
of ruthenium compared to noble metals such as Rh, Ir, Pd, and Au.
However, the vast majority of current state of the art has focused
on the usage of terminal or symmetrical internal alkynes to avoid
the regioselectivity issues. In contrast, unsymmetrical internal alkynes
have so far received much less attention because of the inherent challenges,
such as stereo- and regiospecific selectivities and it could generate
a mixture of four isomers.13 Toward this
end, it is highly desirable to establish a novel method to circumvent
the above limitations.

Trifluoromethyl group as a representative
unique fluorine-containing
moiety can be found in a large number of important drugs and pesticides,
and therefore, the development of a simple and highly efficient protocol
to incorporate trifluoromethyl group into organic molecules has become
an important research topic for chemists.14 Unsymmetrical trifluoromethylated internal alkynes15 as a type of readily available trifluoromethyl group-containing
building blocks have been widely used by our and other groups to construct
a variety of trifluoromethyl group-substituted carbonic or heterocyclic
molecules (Scheme 1a).16−23 During the course of our previous work about the synthesis of trifluoromethylated
isocoumarins (Scheme 1a),17 an unexpected formation of trifluoromethyl
group substituted (E)-enol ester was noticed (Scheme 1d). With respect
to the importance of multisubstituted enol ester, this preliminary
experimental result promoted us to continue to study the addition
reaction in detail. However, literature survey showed that there are
only three examples about the preparation of trifluoromethyl group-substituted
enol esters (Scheme 1b,c).24−26 Kawatsura and Itoh reported a triphenylphosphine-assisted
ruthenium-catalyzed addition of carboxylic acids to aryl and trifluoromethyl
group-substituted unsymmetrical internal alkynes for the synthesis
of trifluoromethyl group-substituted (E)-enol esters
(Scheme 1b).24

Scheme 1 Transition-Metal-Catalyzed Diverse Transformations
of Trifluoromethylated
Alkynes
Later, Szabó group developed a copper-catalyzed
addition
of Togni’s electrophilic CF3 transfer reagent to
terminal alkynes for the access of trifluoromethyl group-substituted
(E)-enol esters (Scheme 1c).25 Very recently,
Zhang and co-workers have demonstrated a syn-carboxylation–trifluoromethylation
reaction of terminal alkynes with a Cu(III)–CF3 complex
to produce trifluoromethyl group-substituted (Z)-enol
esters (Scheme 1c).26 Herein, a simple and useful phosphine-free Ru-catalyzed
addition reaction of benzoic acids with trifluoromethylated internal
alkynes to deliver trifluoromethyl group-substituted (E)-enol esters with excellent regio- and stereoselectivities was developed.

Results and Discussion
To start the initial investigation,
the model reaction of benzoic
acid 1a with trifluoromethylated para-fluorophenylacetylene 2a was used to optimize the reaction
conditions. The results are listed in Table 1. Our previous work17 indicated that the catalyst was of importance for the successful
transformation. Therefore, a series of typical noble-metal catalysts
were initially assessed in combination of silver salt and copper salt
(Table 1, entries 1–5).
The reaction occurred in excellent regio- and stereoselective manner,
and no other possible stereoisomers were detected. Both Ir and Rh
catalysts could generate comparable moderate yields for the desired
(E)-enol ester product 3a. Then, several
Ru catalysts were further screened hoping to enhance the efficiency.
Unfortunately, neither (PPh3)3RuCl2 nor RuCl3 could promote the transformation. And [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 turned out to be the
optimal catalyst in terms of yield and selectivity. Next, a group
of silver salts were screened; however, no one could provide better
results (Table 1, entries
6–10). On the other hand, several copper salts were also evaluated
to deliver comparable efficiencies (Table 1, entries 11–13). Final solvent investigation
indicated that DCM and toluene could generate moderate yields, while
methanol was completely inert for the reaction (Table 1, entries 14–16). The yield for expected
(E)-enol ester product could further improve to 66%
by usage of a bit more Ru catalyst and silver salt with prolonged
reaction time (Table 1, entry 17). Control experimental results indicated that both Ru
catalyst and silver salt were pivotal to the reaction, whereas the
yield decreased to 52% in the absence of copper salt (Table 1, entries 18–20).

a Reaction conditions: 1a (0.2 mmol), 2a (0.3 mmol, 1.5 equiv), catalyst (2.5
mol %), silver salt (10 mol %), and copper salt (20 mol %) in 3 mL
solvent at 100 °C for 12 h.

b No reaction.

c 3.5 mol
% [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 in combination
of 30 mol % AgSbF6 were used. Reaction time was extended
to 21 h.

d No Ru catalyst
was used.

e No silver salt
was used.

f No copper salt
was used, while 3.5
mol % [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 in
combination of 30 mol % AgSbF6 were used for 21 h.

Subsequently, the substrate scope was investigated,
and the results
are depicted in Scheme 2. At first, the scope of benzoic acid part was explored. The absolute
structure of 3q was unambiguously confirmed to be (E)-configuration
by X-ray crystallographic diffraction, while the others were assigned
by analogy. In contrast to our previous work about Ir catalysis,17 herein electron density of benzoic acids did
not affect the reaction too much. Both electron-rich and electron-poor
benzoic acids reacted well to generate the desired adducts in moderate
to good yields along with excellent regio- and stereoselectivities.
It is worth noting that sulfur-containing benzoic acid (1f) could generate moderate yield, which indicates that the sulfur
atom did not poison Ru catalyst. A group of halogen atoms, including
fluorine, chloride, and bromide (3h–j) were well tolerated to produce satisfactory outcomes, which permit
valuable opportunities for further derivatizations via various classical
transition-metal-mediated cross-couplings. A strong electron-withdrawing
group like the trifluoromethyl group also gave acceptable result (3k). On the other hand, the steric hindrance also had limited
effect on the reaction. Para-, meta-, and even ortho-substituents
were compatible in this catalytic system (3l–n).

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope Investigation
The yield in parentheses
was
for 1 mmol scale reaction.

Reaction conditions: 1 (0.2 mmol), 2 (0.3
mmol, 1.5 equiv), 3.5 mol % [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2, 30 mol % AgSbF6, and 20 mol % Cu(OAc)2·H2O in 3 mL of 1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) at
100 °C for 21 h.

Next, some disubstituted
benzoic acids were also exploited, and
all of the tested substrates afforded satisfied results (3o–q). Moreover, this catalytic system could further
extend to aromatic heterocyclic furan-2-carboxylic acid, furnishing
the highest yield of 87% under standard condition (3s). In addition, to enhance the practical usage of this newly developed
method, an enlarged scale reaction of 1s (1 mmol) was
carried out, and 80% yield was obtained. Unfortunately, aliphatic
acids failed to provide the corresponding enol ester product.

After completing exploration of the scope of benzoic acids, the
scope of trifluoromethylated internal alkynes was further explored.
It was delighting to find that these used trifluoromethylated alkynes
reacted well under the standard conditions. A group of substituents
on the benzene ring of internal alkynes were well accommodated for
the process. Diverse halogenated substrates, such as alkynes containing
F, Cl, Br, and I atoms, were all suitable to afford the expected products
smoothly (3t–v). Ester group and tert-butyl group could also be tolerated under the standard
catalytic conditions to obtain moderate yields (3w and 3z). However, trifluoromethylated internal alkyl alkynes were
not suitable for this reaction.

On the basis of the previous
reports3d,3f,24 and experimental
results, a plausible reaction pathway
is suggested to comment the generated excellent regio- and stereoselectivity,
which is demonstrated in Scheme 3. First, by treatment of silver and copper salt, ruthenium
dimer catalyst produces the active monomer species A.
Subsequent anion exchange with benzoic acid 1 leads to
the formation of intermediate B. Then, coordination of
trifluoromethylated phenylacetylene 2 to Ru catalyst
center generates intermediate C, followed by alkyne migratory
insertion into the ruthenium–oxygen bond to provide the six-membered
cycloruthenium complex D. Ultimately, there are two possible
pathways to fulfill the catalytic cycle. Protodemetalation of cycloruthenium
intermediate D by either acid HX, which is generated
by anion exchange before (path a), or another molecule of benzoic
acid 1 (path b) affords the final product trifluoromethyl
group-substituted (E)-enol ester 3.
Meanwhile, the catalyst species A or B could
be revived for next catalytic cycle.

Scheme 3 Proposed Catalytic
Cycle
Herein, it is worth noting that the excellent
regio- and stereoselectivity
should come from the coordination-insertion process. Although the
detailed mechanism has not been clearly documented in previous report,24 we conceive that the excellent regio- and stereoselectivity
should be attributed to the unique electronic property of trifluoromethyl
group. In this proposed catalytic cycle, we give some new insights
to clarify both regio- and stereoselectivity for the addition process.
On the one hand, due to the high electronegativity of the fluorine
atom making trifluoromethyl group a strong electron-withdrawing group,
Cβ of the alkyene is much more electron-poor than Cα.
Therefore, the carboxylic acid prefers adding to Cβ position
regioselectively, whereas the cationic ruthenium center adds to Cα.
On the other hand, the carbonyl oxygen atom of the ester could coordinate
to the Ru center to form the energy-favorable six-membered ring cycloruthenium
complex D, which results in the phenyl and trifluoromethyl
group to be on the same side on the alkene.3f Consequently, the subsequent protodemetalation furnishes (E)-enol ester 3 stereoselectively.

Conclusions
To conclude, a practically useful phosphine-free
Ru-catalyzed direct
addition of benzoic acids to unsymmetrical trifluoromethylated internal
alkynes was successfully developed for the facile access to diverse
trifluoromethyl group-substituted (E)-enol esters.
The substrate scope was broad with good functional group tolerance.
Moderate to good yields along with excellent regio- and stereoselectivities
were achieved for the reaction. A plausible reaction pathway was suggested
to explain the obtained excellent regio- and stereoselectivities for
the addition of benzoic acid to unsymmetric trifluoromethylated internal
alkynes. Further synthetic application of trifluoromethylated internal
alkynes is ongoing in our laboratory and the results will be reported
soon.

Experimental Section
General Information
Unless otherwise noted, all reagents
and transition-metal catalysts were purchased and used as received.
Petroleum ether and ethyl acetate for column chromatography were purified
prior to use by evaporation on a rotary evaporator. Reactions were
monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, which was performed
on aluminum plates precoated with silica gel (Merck, 60 F-254), and
visualized by UV fluorescence (λmax = 254 nm) and/or
by staining with 1% w/v KMnO4 in 0.5 M aqueous K2CO3. Products were purified by flash column chromatography,
which was performed using silica gel 60 (300–400 mesh). Solvents:
petroleum ether and ethyl acetate for column chromatography were purified
prior to use by evaporation on a rotary evaporator. Unless performing
reactions sensitive to air and/or moisture, the solvents were bought
in p.a. quality and used without further purification. Flasks for
absolute solvents were flame-dried three times under oil pump vacuum
and backfilled with argon. Transition-metal catalysts were purchased
and used as received.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra
were acquired on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. Chemical shifts
for 1H NMR spectra are reported in parts per million (ppm)
from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the internal
standard (CDCl3, 7.26 ppm). Data are reported as follows:
chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,
q = quartet, m = multiplet, br = broad), coupling constants (Hz),
and integration. Chemical shifts for 13C NMR spectra are
reported in ppm from the tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance
as internal standard (CDCl3, 77.16 ppm) and with complete
proton decoupling. No internal standard was used for 19F NMR spectra. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was conducted
on an instrument equipped with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI) or electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive-ion
mode. The structures of 3e were assigned by X-ray crystallography
analysis. Melting points for solids were measured on a melting point
apparatus and are given uncorrected.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Trifluoromethyl Group-Substituted
(E)-Enol Esters 3
A 10 mL reaction
tube was charged with benzoic acid 1 (0.2 mmol, 1.0 equiv),
trifluoromethylated internal alkyne 2 (0.3 mmol, 1.5
equiv), [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (4.3
mg, 0.007 mmol, 3.5 mol %), AgSbF6 (20.6 mg, 0.06 mmol,
30 mol %), and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (8.0 mg, 0.04
mmol, 20 mol %). Then, 3 mL of DCE was added by a syringe under atmosphere.
The reaction tube was sealed, and the resulting mixture was stirred
at 100 °C for 21 h. The mixture was cooled down to room temperature
and the solvent was removed with a rotary evaporator. The residue

1.0 equiv), methyl trifluoromethylated para-fluorophenylacetylene 2a (1.5 mmol, 1.5 equiv), [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2]2 (21.5 mg, 0.035 mmol, 3.5 mol %), AgSbF6 (103 mg, 0.3 mmol, 30 mol %), and Cu(OAc)2·H2O (40.0 mg, 0.2 mmol, 20 mol %). Then, 15 mL of DCE was added
by a syringe under atmosphere. The reaction tube was sealed, and the
resulting mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 21 h. The mixture
was cooled down to room temperature and the solvent was removed with
a rotary evaporator. The residue was purified with column chromatography
