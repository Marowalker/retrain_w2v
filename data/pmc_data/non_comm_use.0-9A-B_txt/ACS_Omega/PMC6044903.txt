The stability of
antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) in circulation
is critical for maximum efficacy and minimal toxicity. An ADC reaching
the intended target intact can deliver the highest possible drug load
to the tumor and reduce off-target toxicity from free drug in the
blood. As such, assessment of ADC stability is a vital piece of data
during development. However, traditional ADC stability assays can
be manually intensive, low-throughput, and require large quantities
of ADC material. Here, we introduce an automated, high-throughput
plasma stability assay for screening drug release and aggregation
over 144 h for up to 40 ADCs across five matrices simultaneously.
The amount of ADC material during early drug development is often
limited, so this assay was implemented in 384-well format to minimize
material requirements to <100 μg of each ADC and 100 μL
of plasma per species type. Drug release and aggregation output were
modeled using nonlinear regression equations to calculate formation
rates for each data type. A set of 15 ADCs with different antibodies
and identical valine–citrulline–p-aminobenzylcarbamate–monomethylauristatin
E linker-drug payloads was tested and formation rates were compared
across ADCs and between species, revealing several noteworthy trends.
In particular, a wide range in aggregation was found when altering
only the antibody, suggesting a key role for plasma stability screening
early in the development process to find and remove antibody candidates
with the potential to create unstable ADCs. The assay presented here
can be leveraged to provide stability data on new chemistry and antibody
screening initiatives, select the best candidate for in vivo studies,
and provide results that highlight stability issues inherent to particular
ADC designs throughout all stages of ADC development.

Introduction
Antibody–drug
conjugates (ADCs) have steadily gained attention
over the last two decades for their potential as targeted oncology
therapeutics. Two ADCs are currently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of cancer and more than 50 are undergoing
clinical trials for a variety of different indications. In combining
the targeting capabilities of an antibody with a highly potent small
molecule, ADCs aim to increase the therapeutic index through improved
efficacy and decreased systemic toxicity by selective delivery of
the toxin only to the target tumor cells.1 The cytotoxic agents are chemically attached to an antibody, generally
through either lysine amines or free thiols.2 A chemical linker tethers the antibody and drug together and is
usually designed to be enzymatically cleaved in such a way as to release
the toxin in an active form.3 Throughout
this article, we refer to the cytotoxic agent interchangeably as drug,
toxin, or warhead. Payload is used to signify the linker-drug portion
of the ADC. The release of the drug is carried out by intracellular
proteases in the endolysosomal compartments of the cell and occurs
after the receptor–ADC complex is internalized and trafficked
to the proper intracellular location.4 Noncleavable
linkers are also commonly used; however, these constructs require
catabolism of the antibody to release the active warhead.5,6

For exclusive and selective delivery of drug to the target
cells,
the construct needs to arrive at its destination with a full drug
load. If active drug is released before the ADC can reach the target,
off-target toxicity may result, and less drug will be delivered to
the site of action.7 Factors that negatively
impact safe delivery of intact ADC include plasma-labile linkers,8 blood-proteases,9 and
aggregation-prone molecules, which can lead to immunogenicity or nonspecific
uptake.10 First-generation ADC programs
were hampered by unstable drug linkage, such as hydrazone linkers.11 The knowledge base of linker technologies yielding
highly stable circulating ADCs has grown, and studies over the last
few years have highlighted the wide effect different chemistries can
have on the stability of an ADC.12 Linker
stability questions become more complex when considering species differences.
Plasma stability assessments performed on a single species may not
be representative and could potentially mislead data interpretation
of efficacy and tolerability studies during ADC development.13,14

Drug development is a time-consuming and costly endeavor.
Biologics
can further lengthen the process, with extended in vivo t1/2 necessitating longer duration studies compared to
those of most small molecules. To interrogate how chemical modifications
(i.e., changes to the linker or drug) affect the pharmacokinetic properties
of an ADC, multiweek animal studies are often needed. These studies
can take months to complete from initial study design to final data
analysis, resulting in long cycle times for rounds of structure–activity
relationship investigation. In vitro assays able to triage ADCs with
poor properties prior to the initiation of animal studies could significantly
speed the developmental process and lessen animal usage. Key roadblocks
to the utilization of in vitro assays in the past have been the limited
amounts of ADC material during early developmental phases as well
as time-intensive assays often performed in a low-throughput manner.
Here, we have outlined an automated and multiplexed ADC plasma stability
assay that can provide thorough and rapid characterization of ADC
drug release and aggregation for up to 40 ADCs simultaneously. By
testing ADC stability in multiple species, this assay can serve as
a front line evaluation for ADCs prior to in vivo studies. Additionally,
we deployed this methodology on a set of ADCs and modeled formation
rates of released drug and aggregations for comparison of ADC plasma
stability across the set and between species. This assay can serve
as a critical first-tier, in vitro screening tool for new immunoconjugates,
ultimately leading to better ADC candidates and decreased cycle times
for successive generations of ADC molecules.

Results and Discussion
Protein
Stability
The stability of ADCs in buffer and
plasma from four species was monitored over 144 h at 37 °C. Stability
was assessed in human plasma as well as plasma from relevant preclinical
species: cynomolgus monkey, Sprague Dawley rat, and CD1 mouse. Additionally,
a solution consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at physiological
pH, referred to as “buffer” throughout this work, was
included to monitor the behavior of ADCs in a typical storage solution.
Species were chosen from ones commonly used during various stages
in the ADC development process. Mice are the primary efficacy model
for oncology, with xenograft studies among the most frequently utilized
studies. Rats are useful as preclinical pharmacology and toxicology
models, especially if the antibody is cross-reactive to the target
in rat. Cynomolgus monkeys are often the nonhuman primate of choice
for investigational new drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies. Incubations
in this study were run for 144 h to reach equilibrium for the majority
of tested molecules. A 96 h incubation has been recommended by the
IQ Consortium and is the common incubation duration for IND submissions.7,15

Samples were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
to obtain the percentage of antibody fragments and high molecular
weight species (HMWS) formed in plasma relative to the amount of ADC
monomer present. The terms aggregates and HMWS are used interchangeably
throughout this work. Fluorophore was added to the antibodies of the
ADCs (Figure 1A) for
differentiation of ADCs from endogenous plasma protein by fluorescence
detection.

Schematic of ADCs with broad payload distribution (blue circles) and
stochastic labeling with Alexa Fluor 488 (green stars) for differentiation
of conjugates from endogenous plasma proteins during SEC analysis
to determine the degree of protein aggregation. (B) Monomer, fragments,
and aggregates were measured over a 6 day time course in human plasma
for Ab095–maleimide–caproyl−valine–citrulline–p-aminobenzylcarbamate–monomethylauristatin E (Ab095–vc–MMAE)
conjugates, with an average drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 3.35.
The aggregation data was fit with eq 1, and the best-fit result is shown above the aggregation
curve. Each data point is the mean of two biological replicates with
two technical replicates of each, and the error bars are the standard
deviation. (C–E) The effect of DAR change on the total aggregation
was assessed for DAR species of 2.4, 3.4, and 4.6 in monkey, mouse,
and rat plasma. The data shown is the mean of two replicates for each
time point and sample.

Here, we used a human IgG antibody, Ab095. A valine–citrulline
linker to monomethylauristatin E (MMAE) with a p-aminobenzylcarbamate
(PABC) spacer was attached to Ab095 through maleimide–caproyl
on the free cysteines of the antibody (Ab095–mc–vc–PABC–MMAE,
referred to as Ab095–vc–MMAE for succinctness).16 Aggregation was measured for two conjugation
lots of Ab095–vc–MMAE, with an average DAR of 3.35.
The preparations were composed of a broad distribution of drug to
antibody, with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 species present.17 In Figure 1B, Ab095–vc–MMAE monomer decreased in human plasma
over the incubation time course. Total monomer levels declined from
98 ± 0.5% monomer of the total fluorescence levels at day 0 to
70 ± 2.3% by the sixth day of incubation. The formation of antibody
fragments containing fluorophore contributed little to the monomer
decrease, as only 1.7% of the total fluorescence signal was attributed
to antibody fragments by the conclusion of the incubation. In comparison,
HMWS were at 1.2% in PBS, HMWS levels increased to 2 ± 0.4% upon
human plasma addition, and levels were at 28.4 ± 0.04% after
6 days of incubation. The aggregation of therapeutic antibodies and
ADCs can result from a variety of complex mechanisms,18 and intricate mathematical models have accordingly been
put forth in the past to describe such phenomena.19 Here, we elected to use a simple equation to model aggregation
data and capture HMWS formation over multiday time periods. With the
goal of enabling differentiation of aggregation between ADCs in a
high-throughput screening assay, a mechanistic description of the
underlying cause of aggregation was deemed to be beyond the scope
of this work. The aggregation data points were fit by eq 1, a nonlinear regression, defined
as follows 1  where A is the level of aggregation
at time t, kagg is the
rate of aggregate formation, A0 is the
amount of aggregation at time 0, and Aequilibrium is the projected steady state level of aggregation. Eq 1 is well suited to model the formation
kinetics of HMWS from these data, where the overall aggregation levels
increase over time until a plateau is reached, either at a steady
state value or at the maximum aggregation level (i.e., 100% of the
total signal is composed of HMWS). Additionally, as a nonlinear regression, eq 1 can fit both linear and
nonlinear growth patterns. Using eq 1 on the aggregation data in Figure 1B, a fit was determined with an R2 value of 0.998, an Aequilibrium of 23.1%, and a kagg of 1.02 day–1. The A0 aggregation levels
of 1.4% were added to Aequilibrium to
give an adjusted Aequilibrium of 24.5%
aggregation, which we termed Amax. As Amax is nearly equal to the measured day six
aggregation value (Aday6), both the numerical
data and the graphical data agree with the aggregation plateaus at
28%.

To study the impact of higher DAR on aggregation, SEC profiles
over 6 days were acquired for three DAR variants (DAR 2.4, 3.4, and
4.6) of Ab095–vc–MMAE (Figures 1C–E and 2A).
The different DAR variants were found to have greatly differing levels
of HMWS in each of the plasmas used. The DAR 4.6 material demonstrated
significant initial aggregation that increased over time. For each
of the four plasmas from different species, at least 17% aggregation
was observed at day 0 for the ADC with the highest DAR. The other
two DAR variants had lower initial aggregation (<5% total HMWS)
that rapidly increased, with day 6 levels >16% HMWS for all species
with the DAR 3.4 lot and >14% HMWS for the DAR 2.4 lot. The degree
of aggregation was fairly consistent across the DAR variants within
each species, as the highest DAR Ab095–vc–MMAE yielded
the most aggregation and the lowest DAR ADC yielded the least aggregation.

Figure 2 Rate of
aggregation formation for Ab095–vc–MMAE in
human plasma. (A) Aggregation values over 6 days are plotted for three
lots of Ab095–vc–MMAE containing different DARs. The
data was fit with eq 1. (B) Parameters from the curve fitting, Aequilibrium, kagg, Aday6, Aday0, and R2 values are displayed.

These results are consistent with previous observations of
increasing
aggregation as the DAR is increased.20 Other
studies have found the CH2 domain of IgG to become destabilized
upon higher DAR conjugation, leading to formation of HMWS in buffer
and likely more susceptibility toward aggregation in plasma as well.21 Higher DAR variants of ADCs with vc–MMAE
have also been shown to lead to altered pharmacokinetics due to increased
clearance.22 The mechanism of accelerated
clearance of high DAR species may be attributed to higher hydrophobicity
producing aggregation,15 which leads to
ADC uptake by liver cells; Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells
uptake has been demonstrated to be minimized by decreasing overall
hydrophobicity of the ADC molecule.23 These
data show that one can increase the drug load without sacrificing
ADC plasma stability and pharmacokinetics through design of the ADC
constructs with lower hydrophobicity and aggregation.

Although
the presence of a fluorophore could impact HMWS formation,
the average number of fluorophores added is less than one, representing
a small molecular weight change (∼600 Da per fluorophore) to
the much larger ADC (>150 kDa). Furthermore, different ADCs conjugated
with fluorophores have been shown to have a wide range of HMWS levels
(data not shown), demonstrating that HMWS arise from ADC properties
and interactions with plasma components and not as a result of fluorophore
addition. Accordingly, this approach provided the ability to rank
order ADCs on the basis of relative aggregation levels.

A numerical
approach was used to compare the data for the three
DAR variants from incubations with human plasma, and eq 1 was utilized to determine the rate
of aggregate formation (Figure 2A). Four values from the regression fitting were most useful
for the purpose of comparison. The metrics of kagg, Aequilibrium, Aday0, and Aday6 displayed
in Figure 2B are enough
to summarize the data. The rate of each DAR species shows that the
middle DAR has the fastest aggregation, with a 1.07 day–1kagg, whereas the high DAR species has
a kagg of 0.15 day–1, a slow rate compared to that of the other two. The Aday6 values of the DAR 3.4 and 4.6 species are similar,
with DAR 3.4 having slightly higher Aday6 aggregation levels. However, the initial aggregation value for DAR
4.6 starts much higher at 22.3%, and slower, more linear growth kinetics
leads to an Amax of 31.5%, whereas the Amax of the DAR 3.4 lot remains about the same
as that of the Aday6 value because the
steady state had already been achieved.

The extension of these
numerical analyses to larger data sets can
aid in comprehension of the data. The amount of data can quickly scale
due to an analysis matrix of five different incubation conditions,
with an array of changing antibodies, attachments, linker chemistries,
and drugs. As such, numerical analyses could become a necessity for
a given series of ADCs. Accordingly, the focus here is to provide
a simplistic way to compare large data sets to differentiate the most
well-behaved ADCs and inform future iterations of ADCs, especially
if a performance benchmark has been determined for a particular target.
Because many facets dictate the general aggregation levels of ADCs,
it may be unadvisable to draw a hard line of acceptable aggregation
to be used for all ADC series. However, a benchmark for each target
can advise on whether changes to ADC chemistry have positive or negative
outcomes on plasma stability.

Drug Release
In
addition to protein stability, the
levels of released warhead in plasma were measured over time to assess
the stability of the linker-drug. Limiting free circulating warhead
is a critical consideration when designing an ADC molecule. The separation
of toxin from the antibody before its arrival at the target cells
can lead to off-target toxicity. Additionally, antibodies with no
or reduced drug load can compete against antibodies containing drug
for binding to target receptors, which may lead to a loss of efficacy.
Knowledge of ADC behavior in plasma of preclinical species can not
only help interpret outcomes from toxicity and efficacy studies but
also inform researchers of potential liabilities prior to in vivo
studies. For example, a poorly behaved ADC in a mouse efficacy study
may show poor efficacy than a similar but more stable ADC. Another
example would be if rat was initially chosen as a toxicity model but
was found to have much greater release kinetics than that predicted
for human. Plasma stability data in such an instance could help guide
selection of the best preclinical species in which to perform toxicity
studies to best predict human outcomes.

The measurement of the
released drug was performed in parallel with the aggregation analysis
to gain insight on the stability of the linker-drug in buffer and
plasmas over time. The amount of drug release from the ADC was quantitated
by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and
expressed as a percentage of the theoretical starting drug concentration
in the system. To enable the LC–MS analysis, plasma proteins
were precipitated with organic solvent and removed by centrifugation,
an efficient sample cleanup procedure previously shown to remove >90%
protein while retaining small molecules in solution.24 Under these conditions, both free and previously noncovalently
protein-bound drug will be present in the supernatant for measurement
as unconjugated drug.25 Accurate quantitation
of the drug was performed using six-point standard curves prepared
in the appropriate matrix and processed alongside of the samples.
For an ADC with DAR 4, the standard curve was prepared to be able
to quantify release amounts from 0.02 to 112%. This wide range enables quantitation of drug release for both
stable (e.g., <0.1% release) and unstable (e.g., >10% release)
ADCs in the same experiment.

Levels of unconjugated MMAE from
Ab095–vc–MMAE ADC
were <1% of the theoretical starting amount after 6 days of incubation
in PBS buffer, human plasma, and cynomolgus plasma. Conversely, rodent
plasma produced significantly higher concentrations of free MMAE (Figure 3A). In rat plasma,
free MMAE levels were 2.5% of the theoretical total MMAE present after
6 days. Levels in CD1 mouse plasma were approximately 10-fold higher,
at nearly 25% after 6 days. The higher degree of linker proteolysis
observed in mouse plasma compared to that of the other species can
be attributed to the enzyme carboxylesterase 1C, of which the valine–citrulline
linker on our ADC is a substrate.9,13 Rat plasma
may also contain carboxylesterases with activity toward valine–citrulline,
albeit not to the same extent as mouse plasma.9

Figure 3 MMAE
release over time from Ab095–vc–MMAE in different
matrices. The percent of released MMAE over 6 days at 37 °C was
measured by LC−MS in mouse, rat, monkey, and human plasma,
as well as in PBS. (A) Data is from the mean of four biological replicates,
each with averaged data from two technical replicates, and error bars
are standard error. (B) The stability of MMAE was measured in the
matrices, with the amount remaining at each time point normalized
to the initial amount at day 0. (C) The data was fit using the nonlinear
regression outlined in eq 2. The inset on the right is a zoomed-in section of the data.

Because this assay used a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer,
our analysis was focused on a specific molecular weight, defined prior
to analysis of the samples. Metabolism of drug could change the released
product mass and lead to lower detectable levels of the targeted molecular
weight species measured. Any metabolism or instability (e.g., precipitation)
of the drug in the matrices could produce misleading results on the
degree of drug release by underrepresenting the actual amounts of
drug release from the ADC. To better understand the measured warhead
levels from this assay, the stability of the warhead in the different
matrices must be measured to properly interpret the ADC released drug
data. In Figure S1A, the amount of release
of a different warhead, specified here as Drug #1, from an ADC, referred
to as ADC #1, was nearly 2% in mouse plasma, which was significantly
higher than the negligible amount of released drug observed for monkey
plasma and buffer. When the stability of Drug #1 was assessed in the
matrices, Drug #1 was shown to be unstable in mouse and monkey plasma
(Figure S1B). These data highlight the
possibility of release in monkey plasma with drug instability possibly
limiting overall drug accumulation from ADC in plasma over time. Furthermore,
the 2% of release in mouse plasma was likely an underestimate of the
actual released drug amounts because instability decreases the amount
of drug measured. Simulations were run to visualize the impact drug
instability (Figure S1C) has on overall
measured release levels (Figure S1D). Even
with a warhead half-life of 4–5 days, the overall effect on
measured levels of free warhead can be greater than 50%. Poor warhead
stability can quickly diminish the levels of detectable warhead, which
could make an unstable warhead with high release appear stable if
only ADC plasma stability is used, as observed in monkey plasma for
ADC #1. With the effect of drug stability in mind, the MMAE drug was
incubated in the different matrices to capture the stability of MMAE
on its own. Our observations show MMAE to be relatively stable in
the five matrices tested, with at least 92% MMAE remaining for all
matrices after 6 days at 37 °C (Figure 3B). When ADC and drug stability data are
considered together, greater confidence can be placed in the Ab095–vc–MMAE
stability data for buffer, human, and cynomolgus plasma.

As
with the aggregation data, the ADC plasma release data can be
captured with a similar nonlinear equation. The regression equation
follows the same format as that of the equation described above, with
different naming conventions 2  where R is the percentage
of release of the theoretical total amount of the conjugated drug
at time t, Requilibrium is the release as a percentage of the total warhead at steady state, krelease is the rate of unconjugated drug formation,
and R0 is the amount of unconjugated drug
at the start of the incubation. Ab095–vc–MMAE release
data was evaluated using eq 2 (Figure 3C).
The best-fit equation for mouse plasma generated a nearly 10-fold
higher krelease value than that of the
other plasma matrices and had an Requilibrium of 30.2%, which was similar to the measured day six level. Because
of the close proximity between the two values, the release in mouse
appears to be near completion after 6 days. In contrast, the projected Requilibrium values extend much past their Rday6 values for the other matrices tested, indicating
that release would continue after day 6. All projections have visual
alignment with the graphical data, as mouse seems to have reached
equilibrium by day 6, whereas the other plasma matrices produced more
linear data.

The release profile of an ADC containing a noncleavable
linker
was also investigated. The construct contained Ab095 conjugated directly
to another auristatin molecule, monomethylauristatin F, through a
maleimide–caproyl attachment (Ab095–mc–MMAF).
In Ab095–mc–MMAF, 0.02–0.03% of the total MMAF
was released in the various plasmas after the full incubation time
course (Figure S2A). MMAF was also shown
to be stable in all matrices (Figure S2B). This low level of release indicates the mc attachment portion
of the molecule was not susceptible to cleavage in plasma. However,
cysteine switching of the maleimide onto the free cysteine-34 of serum
albumin has been shown to occur and can lead to significant DAR loss
over time.26 Because we are only monitoring
unconjugated warhead, our method would not detect this payload transfer.
In addition to payload transfer, alterations to the attachment chemistry
can have a substantial change on the release profile of an ADC containing
a dipeptide linker. In Figure S2C, two
ADCs with the same antibody backbone, linker, and warhead but different
attachment chemistries had the levels of released drug measured. One
attachment, a maleimide–caproyl attachment, yielded >24.6%
release in mouse plasma, and the other attachment, a stable diaminopropionic
acid attachment,27 had 2.4% release on
average over three replicates. The stabilization, which promotes hydrolysis
of the maleimide ring to limit retro-Michael reaction, appears to
have also altered the susceptibility of the valine–citrulline
to be cleaved in plasma. These results demonstrate that all portions
of an ADC can contribute to plasma stability of the linker-drug.

Screening and Characterization of ADCs
A set of 15
ADCs was analyzed to determine the formation of aggregation and drug
release levels in plasma over 6 days. The ADCs were comprised of different
antibodies conjugated with the same vc–MMAE payload. The immunoconjugates
were incubated in the five matrices detailed above, and aliquots were
taken for parallel analysis by MS and SEC. Aggregation levels of the
ADCs after 6 days in different plasma matrices are shown in Figure 4A. The median levels
of HMWS were 25.3% for rat, 26.0% for mouse, 20.3% for monkey, and
24.2% for human plasma. Aggregation was much lower in buffer, with
a median level of 2.3%. Levels of aggregation were varied among the
set of ADCs investigated. For example, in rat plasma, the highest
percentage of aggregation after the 6 day incubation was 33.3% of
the total amount of ADC signal and the lowest aggregation was 17.0%.
The data was fit with eq 1 (rat plasma aggregation in Figure 4B and the other four matrices in Figure S3A–C). All fitted data had equations with R2 values >0.98, except one ADC in the monkey
plasma set, which had an R2 value of 0.95.
Interestingly, although monkey plasma produced the lowest overall
aggregation levels of the plasma matrices, the monkey plasma had the
highest kagg with >2-fold higher median kagg values compared to the rodent species (Figure S4A). The aggregation levels increased
quickly in the monkey plasma but reached steady state in less time
and at a lower value than in the other plasma matrices. More generally,
the difference in kagg values between
rodent plasma and the primate plasmas distinguished the shapes of
the aggregation formation, as faster rates for primate plasma lead
to steady state being achieved sooner than in rodent. The data fits
were used to calculate predicted levels of aggregation after 28 days,
which represents approximately two t1/2 of a long-lasting ADC. The difference between the measured Aday6 (Figure 4A) and the predicted Aday28 (Figure 4C) levels
are small, at a mean change of 0.38% aggregation across all species.
These small changes between Aday6 and Aday28 correspond well with the visual observation
that by day 6 the data has either already reached or would soon reach
the steady state. Although these data are mostly at equilibrium by
the end of our experiment, this may not always be the case and the
differences between Aday6 and Amax would be informative in such a case.

and (bottom) release levels in parallel over 6 days. (A) A box and

The line through the box is the median value. (B) Aggregation data

by a box and whisker plot. (E) The fit released drug data from rat
plasma using eq 2 is
graphed. (F) The predicted amount of release at day 28 is represented
with box and whisker plots.

The release data for the set of ADCs was similar to the release
levels seen with Ab095–vc–MMAE in that there was, on
average, >20% release in mouse plasma, >4% release in rat plasma,
and <1% release in human and monkey plasma after 6 days of incubation
(Figure 4D). As above,
data was fit with eq 2 (Figures 4E and S3D–F). The majority of the fit data had R2 values >0.99, but there were five instances
in the human and monkey data sets where a fit <0.9 was achieved.
In contrast to the small differences between Aday6 and Aday28, Rday6 and Rday28 were significantly
different. Several projected Rmax values
reached the maximum 100% release due to linearity in free drug formation.
In the case of these linear data, steady state conditions were not
approached by the end of the incubation. To make the values more pharmacologically
relevant, day 28 was used as above, which resulted in higher release
levels than those seen at day 6, but significantly less than 100%
release due to the slow release rates. In contrast to the other species,
equilibriums were achieved in mouse plasma, as the small difference
between Rmax and Rday6 indicates. The change in release between Rmax and Rday6 of 2.2% in mouse
shows much less of a difference than that in the other species, wherein
the mean differences were between 13.6 and 40.2%. Looking at the krelease values, mouse plasma produces a release
rate almost three-fold higher than any of the other species (Figure S4B). Taking these data together, the
mouse has rapid initial drug release until reaching the steady state,
whereas the other ADCs have slower but steadier free drug formation
kinetics.

We next were interested in the correlation between
aggregation
and drug release. The data sets were linearly fit, and a poor correlation
was found between the data sets, as the highest R2 value was 0.03 (Figure S5). Therefore, in these data, no connection exists between the release
of drug and formation of HMWS. In Figure S6, we graphed the species demonstrating the most aggregation and toxin
release. The mouse plasma produced the highest release values for
all but one ADC, which had slightly more release in the rat plasma.
The higher toxin levels were expected due to the presence of carboxylesterase
1C in mouse plasma, as mentioned above. The aggregation data had less
of a rodent bias, with human and mouse producing the most aggregation
in seven ADCs each.

Overall, each ADC displayed fairly consistent
behavior. If high
aggregation was found for an ADC in one species, it could be expected
the other ADCs would display similar HMWS levels. When the aggregation
of one species was plotted against the aggregation of another species,
the linear fits of the graphs produced positive slopes (i.e., as aggregation
increased in one species, it likely increased in other species too)
and R2 values between 0.60 and 0.85 (Figure S7A). Similarly, the release levels of
the ADCs had positive slopes, although with less correlation (R2 values between 0.16 and 0.74) than that of
the aggregation data (Figure S7B). However,
these data also highlight the wide range in aggregation, with the
only variation in the ADCs coming from a change in the antibody backbone.
In addition, a 6 day incubation appears to be excessive, especially
for assessing aggregation, as most of the “action” has
taken place after 2 or 3 days; the equations presented here could
be used to model predicted results at extended time points, further
streamlining the assay in the future. These results suggest potentially
testing a panel of antibodies during antibody selection, as the specific
structure and conformation may influence ADC stability.

Conclusions
Protein aggregation is important to monitor, as aggregation can
negatively impact ADC pharmacokinetics and potentially lead to immunogenicity.28,29 Many of the ADCs shown in this work had high levels of aggregation
and toxin release and would likely not have the physiochemical properties
necessary to progress further into development. By utilizing the data
from this assay correctly, these molecules could be prescreened with
only the top ADCs moving forward, saving valuable time and effort
in the pursuit of the best candidates. In addition, the plasma stability
of one species may not be reflective of others, so correct interpretation
of in vivo studies warrants testing in the appropriate matrix. As
described above, many factors can influence the aggregation of ADCs,
including the DAR, attachment chemistry, payload, and antibody backbone.
Additionally, knowledge of payload stability for an ADC is crucial,
as any significant stability issues can greatly diminish efficacy
and lead to off-target toxicity driven by the unconjugated drug present
in the bloodstream. By designing ADCs with their plasma stability
in mind, monomeric ADCs with fully intact payloads can arrive at their
target destination. Furthermore, through miniaturization, automation,
and parallel SEC and LC−MS measurements, a rapid and timely
assessment of ADC stability at the earliest stages of ADC development
efforts can be performed. Using these data earlier in drug discovery
will allow for accelerated decision making, reduction in animal and
material costs, and improvement in the probability of success.

Future methodological additions, with an eye toward further understanding
of ADC plasma stability and increased usability for uncharacterized
ADCs, could include metabolite profiling and toxin accounting. Qualitative
survey scans or neutral loss could be implemented for metabolite identification
by finding precursor ions with characteristic fragment ions corresponding
to the drug of interest; such a workflow would be beneficial for new
linker-drug combinations in which the released product is unknown.
These workflows could help identify various toxin containing components
(e.g., linker + drug or attachment + linker + drug) that could additionally
be liberated in plasma. Further, determination of the warhead fate
after plasma incubation could serve to highlight important characteristics
of the ADC, including cysteine switching to albumin proteins.24 A possible procedure would be to measure ADC-associated
warhead, the warhead in the soluble fraction, and the warhead in the
protein fraction. These data together could be used to determine a
“mass balance” of drug in the system. One could also
add in a hydrophobic interaction chromatography measurement to determine
the composition of DAR for each ADC,30 although
the method does not always sufficiently separate different DAR species.
In summary, these focused efforts on understanding the stability of
ADCs in plasma through in vitro assessments will enable more efficient
drug development processes and furthered learnings about the complex
interactions between biologics and biomatrices.

Experimental Procedures
ADC Preparation
A solution of 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was added to a 10 mg/mL solution of
antibody, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for
1 h. A solution of 3.3 mM linker-warhead payload in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) was added to the reduced antibody and gently mixed for 30 min.
The reaction solution was washed and purified on a PD10 desalting
column and then filtered through a 0.2 μm, low protein-binding
13 mm syringe-filter and stored at 4 °C.

Antibody Labeling with
Fluorophore
ADCs were diluted
to a target concentration of 0.5 mg/mL with pH 7.4 PBS. Aliquots of
50 μL were transferred to a 96-well plate. The ADCs were then
fluorescently labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 TFP (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA), which reacts with the free amines present on the antibody.
To enable antibody labeling, 6 μL of 1 M sodium bicarbonate
was first added to the plate, followed by 3 μL of Alexa Fluor
488 TFP reconstituted to 1 mg/mL in DMSO. Samples were incubated in
the dark at room temperature with shaking for 2 h. The labeling reaction
was quenched with 60 μL of 0.2 M Tris–HCl pH 7.4. On
average, less than one fluorophore was added to each ADC.

Sample Processing
Following labeling, 10 μL was
transferred into a 384-well plate and diluted with 90 μL of
PBS or plasma containing 1.8 mg/mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
and 10 mM sodium azide. The different plasmas (BioreclamationIVT,
Baltimore, MD) used were from CD1 mice, Sprague Dawley rats, cynomolgus
monkeys, and humans.

The ADC-containing buffer/plasma samples
were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Samples were
collected after incubation times of 0, 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 h with
a Biomek FXP Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis,
IN). The plasma plates were retrieved from the Cytomat Plate Hotel
in the incubator. Five microliters from each well was transferred
to two 384-well plates, with one containing 70 μL of 95:5 acetonitrile/methanol,
with 50 nM carbutamide as the internal standard. Using a Multi-drop
Combi Reagent Dispenser (Thermo Scientific), 20 μL of water
and 5 μL of DMSO were added to the plate containing the organic
solvent. Plates were spun at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C prior
to further analysis.

Aggregate, Fragment, and Monomer Determination
SEC
was performed on an Infinity II Bio-Inert 1260 HPLC (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA) comprised of a quaternary pump (G5611A), temperature-controlled
well plate autosampler (G5667A, G1330B), column compartment (G1316C),
and fluorescent detector (G1321B). A Waters SEC column (Waters Corp.,
Milford, MA) with a guard column was used as the stationary phase
(Acquity BEH200 SEC; 30 × 4.6 mm2 and 150 × 4.6
mm2, 1.7 μm particle size, 200 Å pore size).
The mobile phase was comprised of
100 mM sodium phosphate and 150 mM sodium chloride in water with the
pH adjusted to 7.0. Typical peak elution was for 3.5–3.6 min
at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min, with a column temperature of 30 °C.
All samples were chilled to 8 °C during analysis. Data peaks
were processed with Atlas Chromatography Data System version 9.0 (Thermo
Scientific) to determine the percentages of aggregate, fragment, and
monomer.

Standard Curve Preparation and Method Optimization
Standard curves for each unconjugated drug were prepared in 384-well
plates. Six concentration points were delivered per compound in 5
μL of DMSO. These plates were then stamped with 5 μL of
matrix, 70 μL of organic solution with internal standard (described
previously), and 20 μL of water. Plates were then sealed and
spun at 3000 rpm for 5 min prior to MS injection.

Small molecules
were diluted in 50:50 acetonitrile/water with 0.1% formic acid at
a final concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 μM and tuned through
DiscoveryQuant Optimize version 2.1.3. The QuickTune workflow is used
to generate the tune parameters. The precursor ion scan type is set
to Q3 MS, with a spectrum window width of ±0.5 amu and a high
collision gas setting. The MS2 product ion will display five fragments,
with a minimum fragment loss of 20 amu and a starting mass of 55 amu.
Compounds were tuned in positive mode to start and then negative mode
if required. The settings consisted of a precursor threshold of 1
× 105 counts/s and fragment threshold of 1 ×
104 counts/s, with a mass range between 50 and 1200 amu.

The MRM methods were made using DiscoveryQuant Analyze version
2.1.3 (Sciex). Each method consisted of one transition for the analyte
of interest and a transition for the carbutamide internal standard.
The MMAE transition had a Q1 mass of 718.7, a Q3 mass of 686.5, and
a collision energy setting of 42 V. The Q1 mass for carbutamide was
272.2 Da, the Q3 mass was 108.1 Da, and collision energy was 35 V.

LC–MS Analysis
Measurements of unconjugated
drug concentrations were performed with a 5500 Qtrap (Sciex) mass
spectrometer coupled to an Agilent 1290 LC system with a CTC PAL autosampler.
A Kinetex 5 μm 100 Å C18, 30 × 2.1 mm2 column
was used with a 0.9 min LC gradient. The mobile phase A was composed
of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade water with
0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid
in HPLC-grade acetonitrile. The starting gradient conditions were
95% solvent A and 5% solvent B, with a steep ramp to 98% solvent B
by 0.3 min. The high percent solvent B was held for 0.4 min, then
quickly returned to starting conditions for column equilibration prior
to the next injection.

Data was processed in Sound Review Analytics
software version 2.2.0.8688 (Sound Analytics), which allows for autointegration
of the peaks. Standard curves were fit with a quadratic regression,
with 1/x weighting. The integration algorithm uses
“IntelliQuan” with a baseline subtraction window of
1 min, a noise percentage of 10%, a peak splitting factor equal to
10, a minimum width of 0 s, and a minimum height of 1 × 104 counts/s.

Integrated peak data was imported into IDBS
E-Workbook Suite 9.1.0.
A Biobook template automatically calculated the concentration of warhead
at each time point, and then the corresponding percentage of release
compared to the total amount of warhead in the system was calculated.

Postprocessing Data Analysis
Aggregation and drug release
data were fit using GraphPad Prism 5.0 for Windows. Nonlinear regressions,
defined in eqs 1 and 2, were used after making custom analysis equations
in Prism. Aequilibrium and Requilibrium were constrained with maximum values of 100,
and curves were fit using a maximum of 1 × 103 iterations.
Simulations of drug stability and measured warhead release were performed
in Matlab SimBiology 5.2.
