A template-directed, sol–gel
synthesis is utilized to produce
crystalline RuO2 nanowires. Crystalline nanowires with
a diameter of 128 ± 15 nm were synthesized after treating the
nanowires at 600 °C in air. Analysis of these nanowires by X-ray
powder diffraction revealed the major crystalline phase to be tetragonal
RuO2 with a small quantity of metallic ruthenium present.
Further analysis of the nanowire structures by high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy reveals that they are polycrystalline and are
composed of interconnected, highly crystalline, nanoparticles having
an average size of ∼25 nm. Uniform 3 nm Pt nanoparticles were
dispersed on the surface of RuO2 nanowires using an ambient,
solution-based technique yielding a hybrid catalyst for methanol oxidation.
Linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) and chronoamperometry performed
in the presence of methanol in an acidic electrolyte revealed a significant
enhancement in the onset potential, mass activity, and long-term stability
compared with analogous Pt nanoparticles supported on commercially
available Vulcan XC-72R carbon nanoparticles. Formic acid oxidation
LSVs and CO stripping voltammetry revealed that the RuO2-supported Pt nanoparticles exhibit significantly higher CO tolerance,
which leads to higher catalytic stability over a period of several
hours. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results suggest that crystalline
RuO2 leads to less-significant oxidation of the Pt surface
relative to more widely studied hydrous RuO2 supports,
thereby increasing catalytic performance.

Introduction
The electrochemical
oxidation of small organic molecules (SOMs)
is a key electrochemical process and has broad technological applications
in fuel cells, sensors, and catalysis.1−5 Recently, most attention has been focused on the oxidation of alcohols
such as methanol and ethanol, utilizing an ever-broadening array of
Pt-based electrocatalysts.4,5 Considerable increases
in catalytic activity and stability have been achieved by tuning the
size, composition, and morphology of Pt catalysts. While the catalyst
is responsible for much of chemistry, the catalyst support can also
play a crucial role in the mechanism of SOM oxidation.6 Traditionally, platinum catalysts are supported on nanoparticulate
carbon such as Vulcan XC-72R.6−8 However, carbon supports are susceptible
to oxidation and degradation during the SOM oxidation, which can lead
to loss of Pt utilization and poor long-term durability of the catalyst.9 1  

In addition
to challenges with the stability of the catalyst support,
the effective oxidation of SOMs on Pt requires high overpotentials
because of catalyst poisoning effects.10−12 For example, methanol
oxidation (eq 1) on Pt
follows an indirect pathway that leads to the preferential formation
of CO as a partially oxidized intermediate.10 At low overpotentials, adsorbed methanol is rapidly converted to
CO via a multi-step dehydrogenation process that occurs at Pt–Pt
pair sites. Because CO oxidation requires significant overpotential,
the kinetics of methanol oxidation is hindered at low overpotentials
by the high coverage of CO. This effect is commonly referred to as
“CO poisoning” and it is a key challenge with oxidizing
a broad range of SOMs on Pt. One approach to overcome the challenge
of CO poisoning is to alloy Pt with oxophilic metals such as Ru to
promote a bifunctional mechanism.13,14 In these alloys,
the Ru sites adsorb oxide species at lower potentials than Pt and
facilitate the oxidation of CO through a process referred to as CO
spillover. Recent studies have also shown that the formation of hydrous
ruthenium oxide from the oxidation of Pt–Ru alloy nanoparticles
(NPs) may be an active phase that facilitates CO oxidation.15−17

In light of the challenges surrounding catalytic activity
and stability,
there is a growing interest in metal oxides as supports for Pt-based
SOM catalysts.18,19 Metal oxides such as TiO2 and RuO2 are stable over a wide pH range and are
less susceptible to oxidation and degradation than traditional carbon-based
supports.20−32 More importantly, metal oxide supports have been shown to facilitate
SOM oxidation on Pt NPs via several mechanisms. For example, oxides
improve the three-dimensional dispersion of Pt NPs, leading to better
Pt utilization.20,32 Analogous to the bifunctional
mechanism of Ru dopants, the
surfaces of metal oxides can provide oxide species or facilitate the
transport of hydroxide species to support CO spillover at the interface
between the Pt particle and the oxide surface.23,25,30 In addition, several reports have shown
that oxide supports lead to significant changes of the electronic
structure of Pt via the strong metal/support interaction (SMSI) effect.6,22,27,32 The structural interaction between the oxide support and Pt catalysts
leads to significant variations in the d-band vacancy of the Pt NP
and can promote either reversible or irreversible oxidation of Pt,
depending on the strength of the interaction. A higher degree of oxophilicity
of the Pt catalyst is expected to further enhance CO tolerance.

Among the wide range of metal oxides, ruthenium oxide has a comparably
high conductivity and its surface is hydrated in acidic media, leading
to the presence of beneficial hydroxyl species.18 Past work has focused primarily on hydrous ruthenium oxide,
which is partially crystalline and has varying stoichiometry, depending
upon the reaction conditions. Hydrous RuO2 leads to enhanced
SOM oxidation performance of Pt but is less conductive than crystalline
RuO2 and the strong SMSI effect leads to partial irreversible
oxidation of the Pt surface.6,22,27,32 Relatively few studies have investigated
the support effect in well-defined, crystalline, RuO2 nanostructures.18

In this work, we synthesize crystalline,
tetragonal RuO2 NWs with a uniform diameter of ∼130
nm using a template-directed
sol–gel synthesis method. A solution-based method was employed
to deposit a uniform dispersion of Pt NP on the surface of the RuO2 NWs. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) performance of
the hybrid Pt NP/RuO2 NWs is compared with that of Pt NPs
supported on commercially available Vulcan XC-72R carbon NPs (Pt NP/C).
The RuO2 support leads to measurable enhancements in the
onset potential, kinetics, Pt utilization, and long-term stability
of MOR relative to the commercial Pt NP/C. A study of the key mechanistic
intermediates including CO and formic acid reveals that the crystalline
RuO2 supports lead to significant improvements in the CO
tolerance of the Pt NPs supported on RuO2. In addition,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggest that crystalline
RuO2 leads to less-significant oxidation of Pt NPs relative
to the results observed for hydrate RuO2 supports in the
prior literature.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis
of the RuO2 NWs was accomplished via a
template-assisted, sol–gel technique based on previously developed
methods for other metal oxides.33,34 A novel two-step approach
was developed to prepare uniform nanowires without the presence of
excess bulk material that is typically formed on the surface of the
template. Details regarding the development of the two-step process
can be found in the Supporting Information section. In the first step, a polycarbonate filter membrane with
a nominal pore diameter of 200 nm was impregnated with a RuCl3 sol by vacuum filtration. Once the ethanol solution was loaded
into the template, the surface was polished to remove ruthenium residues,
while leaving the precursor in the pores undisturbed. The gelation
process was initiated by exposing the saturated template to propylene
oxide vapors in a glass reactor. The color of the template immediately
began to change from a brownish-red color to jet-black once exposed
to the vapors of propylene oxide. This color change indicated that
the gelation reaction between RuCl3 contained within the
pores and the propylene oxide had occured. The reaction proceeded
for several minutes to allow for the penetration of vapors into the
template pores.

To convert the sol–gel into crystalline
RuO2,
the template was annealed at 600 °C for 30 min. This heating
step also resulted in the vaporization of polycarbonate, thus alleviating
the need for further processing. Scanning electron microscopy of the
resulting powder (Figure 1) revealed that the material consisted almost entirely of
well-dispersed, one-dimensional, NW structures, with only a small
fraction of the material consisting of NPs. The diameter of NWs was
determined to be 128 ± 15 nm with lengths of up to 3 μm.
The measured diameter is ∼70 nm smaller than the nominal diameter
of the 200 nm pore dimensions. The smaller size of the wires relative
to the template pore diameter can be explained by the removal of the
organic species and densification of the structures during crystallization,
which has been observed previously.34

image showing the 1D structure of the RuO2 nanomaterials
with an average diameter of 128 ± 15 nm. (B) SEM image showing
the RuO2 nanomaterials have various lengths up to ∼3
μm.

Powder XRD was performed to characterize
the crystallinity and
structure of the RuO2 nanowires. The diffraction pattern
(Figure 2) shows that
the sample is composed primarily of tetragonal RuO2, with
unit cell parameters of a = 4.49 Å and c = 3.11 Å. In prior reports, characterization of hydrous
RuO2, RuO2·xH2O, by XRD yielded broad, undefined peaks consistent with the amorphous
nature of the hydrated material.35,36 Typically,
temperatures of 400 °C or higher are necessary to fully crystallize
RuO2 producing well-defined diffraction peaks. In this
case, a heat treatment at 600 °C was employed to crystallize
the RuO2 NWs, leading to the well-defined peaks observed
in the XRD pattern. In addition to crystalline RuO2, there
is also a small impurity of hexagonal Ru, which indicates that a small
fraction of RuCl3 at the core of the wires was not exposed
to the propylene oxide vapors. The presence of Ru may have key benefits
in terms of catalysis because it can react with the Pt precursor during
the Pt NP deposition step, leading to the formation of Pt–Ru
alloy NPs.

Figure 2 Powder XRD pattern of the RuO2 nanomaterial showing
that the major phase of the material is RuO2 (red lines,
COD 9007541) with a small Ru impurity (blue lines, COD 9008513).

High-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) was performed
to examine the microstructure of the RuO2 NWs. The nanowire
morphology is evident in Figure 3A and it was confirmed that the 1D structures were
solid NWs and not hollow nanotubes. The size of the nanowires measured
from the TEM images is 139 ± 19 nm, which is in agreement with
the measurements from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It is
evident from the TEM images that the nanowires are composed of interconnected
NPs with a diameter of ∼25 nm. The polycrystalline nature of
the NWs is consistent with the sol–gel synthesis because the
gelling process forms a xerogel within the pores of the template.
A similar motif was observed in Cr2O3 nanowires
produced by a similar template-based sol–gel technique.34 It is important to note that the nanowires produced
have no surface coatings as a result of surfactants or residual template
materials. This allows for direct contact between the catalyst NPs
and the RuO2 surface, which is beneficial for their use
as a catalyst support.

the filled,
polycrystalline nanowire structure. (B) TEM image of the Pt NPs dispersed
onto the surface of the RuO2 nanowires. (C) HRTEM image
of the RuO2 nanowires revealing the {110} plane of the
polycrystalline grains.

The Pt NPs were loaded
onto the surface of the RuO2 NWs
via a solution-based reduction process using sodium borohydride as
a reducing agent. This resulted in the production of well-dispersed
Pt NPs on the surface of the NWs. HRTEM images after Pt NP deposition
(Figure 3B) confirm
the high degree of dispersion and reveal that the Pt NPs have an average
size of 3.3 ± 0.7 nm (see Figure S2 for a histogram of particle size distribution). It can also be seen
from high resolution images that the NPs dispersed on the surface
of the nanowires are in intimate contact with RuO2. Additionally,
the {010} planes of the RuO2 substrate are clearly visible,
confirming that the RuO2 NWs comprise individual, highly
crystalline NPs (Figure 3C).

XPS was performed (see the Supporting Information for additional details) to examine the electronic
properties of
the Pt catalyst and the support materials.37,38 Survey spectra (Figure S3) collected
from the Pt NP/RuO2 NW and Pt NP/C samples confirm the
presence of metallic Pt on both substrates with a nominal loading
of 20%. Fits of the high-resolution scans of the Ru peaks shown in Figure 4A reveal that the
Ru 3d5/2, 3d3/2, and 3p3/2 peaks
are located at 280.9, 285.1, and 463 eV, respectively, and can be
assigned to the +4 oxidation state of ruthenium.39 The sharp cutoff of the Ru 3d5/2 peak suggests
that the metallic ruthenium observed in the XRD is relegated to the
core of the material because it is not detectable by XPS. To examine
the effect of the substrate on the electronic properties of the Pt
catalyst, high-resolution scans were obtained of the Pt 4f peaks (Figure 4B). In both cases,
the Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 peaks were located
at 71.3 and 74.7 eV, respectively, consistent with metallic platinum.40 The absence of a measureable shift in the Pt
4f peaks to higher binding energies suggests that the crystalline
RuO2 support does not contribute to significant oxidation
of the Pt surface. This result contrasts with those of hydrous ruthenium
oxide supports, which were found to result in a shift in the peaks
and measurable oxidation of the Pt surface.22,26

of the Pt 4f peaks (B) of the Pt NPs supported on the RuO2 NW and carbon supports.

Following the above analyses, the electrochemical properties of
the supported Pt particles were examined in 0.1 M HClO4 by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Initially, the samples were cycled from
0 to 1.3 V to achieve a steady electrochemical state. No significant
changes were observed in the hydrogen adsorption or oxide reduction
regions of the CV for the Pt NPs supported on either the RuO2 NWs or the carbon NPs. The stability of the Pt NP/RuO2 NW CV is consistent with the high degree of crystallinity of the
RuO2 support, which is less susceptible to structural reconfiguration
under electrochemical conditions than partially crystalline, hydrous
RuO2 supports.20 In prior reports,
the use of hydrous RuO2 supports typically leads to significant
capacitive effects because of their amorphous structure.6,25−27 In this case, the double layer capacitance is only
slightly higher in the RuO2 NW support, when compared to
the carbon support. This is attributed to the combined effects of
the high crystallinity of RuO2 NW supports and the high
conductivity of tetragonal RuO2.

The CVs of the Pt
NP/RuO2 NW and Pt NP/C catalysts shown
in Figure 5 display
the characteristic hydrogen adsorption/desorption region below 0.4
V. The reversible peak at 0.1 V is consistent with surface defect
sites associated with spherical platinum nanostructures and suggests
that both Pt catalysts have similar surface structures.5,41 The electrochemical surface area (ESA) was determined from the integrated
hydrogen adsorption/desorption charge, and both catalysts were found
to have nearly identical ESAs (Table 1) of approximately 50 m2·g–1. The similarities in the surface structure and surface area of the
platinum highlights the support material as a key factor in determining
catalytic performance.

Both catalysts also
display reversible oxidation of the Pt surface
at potentials above 0.6 V. The position of the surface oxide reduction
peak of the Pt NP/RuO2 NW is located at 0.757 V, which
is shifted by 41 mV to lower potentials when compared with the Pt
NP/C. A similar shift is also observed in the onset for surface oxidation
in the anodic sweep. These results collectively suggest that the interaction
between the RuO2 support and Pt NPs leads to a stronger
interaction with oxygen adsorbates. The formation of surface oxide
species at lower potentials is beneficial in the oxidation of methanol
because oxide species promote the oxidation of the adsorbed CO intermediate
at lower potentials.

The linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) depicted
in Figure 6A reveal
the catalytic performance
of the supported Pt NPs toward MOR. Comparison of the LSVs indicates
that RuO2 NW support contributes to a significant enhancement
in catalytic activity over the entire onset region (Figure 6A inset) relative to the carbon
support. As a control, LSVs were collected from RuO2 NW
and carbon supports and no appreciable faradaic current was observed.
Thus, methanol oxidation results from the presence of Pt. To quantify
the effect of the support on catalytic performance of the Pt NPs,
the onset potentials measured at a current density of 0.1 A·mg–1 and mass and specific activities at 0.7 V are shown
in Table 1 for the
RuO2 NW and Pt NP/C. The onset for MOR is shifted by 30
mV to lower potentials in the Pt NP/RuO2 NW catalyst, suggesting
a lower overpotential for methanol activation and oxidation.

oxidation of supported Pt NPs. LSVs (A) normalized to Pt mass collected
in 0.1 methanol at a scan rate of 20 mV·s–1. The inset highlights the onset region for methanol oxidation. Chronoamperograms
(B) collected at 0.7 V of Pt mass activity as a function of time.

The mass activity of the Pt NP/RuO2 NWs
was determined
to be 0.23 A·mg–1, representing a 1.6-fold
enhancement in activity compared with the Pt NP/C. A similar enhancement
of 1.7-fold was also noted in the specific activity of the RuO2 NW catalysts (Figure S5). Collectively,
these results suggest that the RuO2 support leads to significant
improvements of the MOR activity at low overpotentials. Although it
is difficult to compare results with those obtained in prior reports
under different conditions, the Pt NP/RuO2 NW catalysts
maintain comparable or better results. For example, Ahn and co-workers
observed activities of 0.05 A·mg–1 for the
Pt NP supported on crystalline Ru/RuO2 nanofiber supports
at approximately 0.7 V with a methanol concentration of 2 M in sulfuric
acid and with a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1.30 In terms of hydrous ruthenium oxide supports,
Fujishima and co-workers observed specific activities of 0.1 mA·cm–2 for hybrid Pt/hydrous ruthenium oxide nanostructures
on conductive diamond at approximately 0.7 V in 0.1 M HClO4 containing 3.2 M methanol.22

To
evaluate the long-term stability of the Pt catalysts and supports,
chronoamperometry was performed at 0.7 V. The chronoamperograms in Figure 6B show that both
catalysts undergo a brief induction period of 1–2 min where
catalytic activity increases from the values measured in the LSV.
This can be attributed to an activation of the Pt surface sites as
a result of the surface oxidation that occurs at these potentials.
Subsequently, the activity of both catalysts decreases, approaching
steady-state values of 1.5 and 1.1 A·mg–1 for
the Pt NP/RuO2 NW and Pt NP/C catalysts, respectively.
Over the course of the test, the Pt NP/RuO2 NWs maintain
a higher mass activity, confirming that the enhanced performance in
the LSV is retained after several hours of operation. Moreover, the
Pt NP/RuO2 NW catalysts evolved CO2 gas, which
was visible in the first 10 min of the stability test. The significant
bubble formation resulted in the saw-tooth pattern in the chronoamperogram.
By contrast, there was far less-visible gas formation from the Pt
NP/C electrode. This result suggests that the RuO2 NW support
may lead to a higher faradaic efficiency in the oxidation of methanol
to CO2, although additional experiments beyond the scope
of this report would be necessary to confirm the quantity of gas produced
by each catalyst. 2  

We investigated the performance of the catalysts as a function
of the support material toward the oxidation of formic acid (eq 2) and carbon monoxide.
These species are two key intermediates in the mechanism of methanol
oxidation.10,42 LSVs of formic acid oxidation
are shown in Figure 7A. The Pt NP/RuO2 NW catalysts maintain higher overall
specific activity over the entire formic acid oxidation window, which
is consistent with the enhanced MOR performance. The formic acid oxidation
LSVs for both catalysts is characterized by a peak in the region of
0.8–1.1 V with a corresponding shoulder at lower potentials.
In terms of the mechanism, the peak-shoulder feature in the LSVs of
both catalysts has been widely shown to be associated with catalysts
that undergo an indirect mechanism for the oxidation of methanol.43,44

Figure 7 LSVs
(A) collected in 0.1 M formic acid and CO-stripping voltammograms
(B) collected in 0.1 M HClO4 at scan rates of 20 mV·s–1. Prior to CO stripping, electrodes were immersed
in a CO-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution for a period of
45 min.

The indirect mechanism is expected
for pure platinum and platinum-enriched
alloy catalysts because of the high density of Pt active sites on
the surface. In these catalysts, the dehydrogenation of methanol occurs
at Pt–Pt pair sites, resulting in the rapid formation of an
adsorbed CO intermediate at low overpotentials. The complete oxidation
of CO to CO2 is delayed to higher potentials because CO
oxidation requires the presence of adsorbed oxygen species, which
do not form on Pt at potentials below 0.5–0.6 V. Thus, the
high coverage of CO inhibits MOR activity and requires a high overpotential
to achieve effective MOR kinetics.

Because CO is the primary,
rate-limiting intermediate of the indirect
pathway, the kinetics of methanol oxidation is highly dependent upon
catalyst’s ability to oxidize CO. To determine the relative
onset for CO activation, CO-stripping voltammograms (Figure 7B) were obtained after allowing
the catalysts to fully adsorb CO from a saturated solution. The CO-stripping
peak in the Pt NP/RuO2 NWs occurs at 734 mV, which is more
than 75 mV lower than the onset for CO stripping in Pt NP/C. The onset
for CO oxidation for both catalysts is closely aligned with the onset
in the MOR LSVs, suggesting that CO oxidation limits the kinetics
at low overpotentials. Thus, the enhanced MOR activity in the RuO2 NW supports can be attributed to improved CO oxidation performance
induced by the RuO2 support. In prior reports, enhanced
performance in RuO2-based supports was attributed to a
variety of effects including improved catalyst dispersion,16,24 improved transport of hydroxyl and proton species at the catalytic
interface,25 improved CO tolerance due
to a bifunctional effect,22,23,29,30 as well as the beneficial changes
in the electronic structure of platinum from the SMSI effect.25,32

A common explanation for the enhanced performance in metal
oxide-supported
Pt is derived from the bifunctional mechanism of methanol oxidation
in Pt1–xRux alloys. In PtRu alloys, the Ru surface sites are oxidized
at much lower potentials forming Ru–OH surface species, which
facilitate the oxidation of the CO intermediate formed on the Pt sites.
Like metallic Ru, metal oxides also facilitate the formation of surface
hydroxyl species at low overpotentials. However, unlike in uniform
PtRu alloys, effective CO oxidation via the bifunctional mechanism
can only take place at the Pt–RuO2 interface. The
diffusion of CO from isolated Pt sites to the Pt–RuO2 interface should also be relatively slow because of the strong adsorption
of CO on Pt. Moreover, RuO2 catalysts form relatively thick
oxide layers on the surface in the potential window for MOR on Pt,
which may also slow the transport of hydroxyl groups to Pt catalysts.18 Thus, it is likely that the enhanced activity
cannot solely be attributed to the bifunctional effect but is a combination
of a bifunctional effect and electronic effect of the support on the
Pt catalyst.

In terms of the electronic effect, several reports
have shown that
oxide supports lead to significant changes of the electronic structure
of Pt via the SMSI effect.20,25−27,32 For example, X-ray absorption
spectra of Pt NPs supported on mixed Ti–Ru metal oxides showed
significant variations in the d-band vacancy of the supported Pt NPs
relative to pure Pt.27,32 In the case of the widely used
hydrous ruthenium oxide supports, XPS measurements have shown that
the SMSI effect is strong and leads to partial, irreversible oxidation
of the Pt particle surface.22,26 Although this increases
the available oxide species for the bifunctional oxidation of CO,
the oxidation of the Pt particles leads to a reduction of the available
Pt active sites, potentially lowering the mass activity of the catalyst.

Interestingly, we did not observe significant irreversible oxidation
of the Pt NPs supported on the crystalline RuO2 support
via XPS, which is consistent with recent studies.30 From our CV results, it appears that the crystalline RuO2 has a less significant effect on Pt, leading to a small but
measurable increase in the oxophilicity of the Pt surface sites indicated
by 41 mV shift in the oxide peak. Similar shifts in the oxide region
were observed previously.6 The stronger
interaction with oxide species and the lower onset for surface oxidation
can facilitate CO oxidation on the Pt particle itself as well as at
the Pt–RuO2 interface. Thus, the advantages of crystalline
RuO2 may extend beyond improved stability and conductivity
and may also contribute to improvements in the mechanism of MOR relative
to hydrous ruthenium oxide.

Conclusions
The oxidation of SOMs
has broad applications in fuel cells, catalysis,
and sensors. However, the practical development of catalysts for these
reactions is hindered by the poisoning effects of partially oxidized
carbon species. Traditional strategies for improving SOM oxidation
on carbon-supported Pt-based catalysts have focused largely on tuning
the properties of the Pt catalyst itself. However, tuning the physicochemical
properties of the support material represents a second and equally
important pathway for reducing the effects of poisoning in SOM oxidation
catalysts. In this report, we explore crystalline RuO2 as
a support material for platinum catalysts considering its high conductivity
and beneficial surface properties.

We employ a template-assisted,
sol–gel method to produce
crystalline RuO2 nanowires and subsequently decorate their
surfaces with small Pt NPs (∼3 nm). Electrochemical investigations
of the RuO2-supported Pt NPs revealed that the crystalline
Pt NPs supported on RuO2 NWs required a lower overpotential
to oxidize methanol and had better long-term MOR activity than Pt
NPs supported on traditional carbon supports. XPS results suggest
that crystalline RuO2 leads to less significant oxidation
of the Pt surface relative to more widely studied hydrous RuO2 supports, thereby increasing catalytic performance. From
a broader perspective, our results provide further evidence that support
materials can not only contribute to new active sites for SOM oxidation
but also influence the nature of the catalyst itself through strong
interactions between the catalyst and its support. Thus, rational
approaches to the catalyst design should include tuning the structural
and electronic properties of both the catalyst and the support material.

Experimental
Section
The RuO2 nanowires were synthesized using
a modified
sol–gel method presented by Walker et al.33 Briefly, 0.42 g of RuCl3·xH2O was dissolved in 3.5 mL of 200 proof ethanol. The
solution was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 1–2 h to
ensure complete dissolution of the RuCl3. Once a homogenous
solution was obtained, the solution was filtered through a 200 nm
polycarbonate template (Whatman, Nuclepore track etch) using vacuum
filtration and a glass frit support. Approximately 50 drops were distributed
over the template with applied vacuum to load the pores of the template
with RuCl3. Following this loading procedure, the template
was polished using an Arkansas whetstone to remove the excess Ru precursor
on the surface of the template.

The loaded template was subsequently
placed in a glass reactor
containing 2 mL of propylene oxide and was heated to 65 °C. Care
was taken to keep the template sequestered from the liquid propylene
oxide to prevent dissolution of the template. The Ru precursor in
the template reacted with the propylene oxide vapors for a period
of 5 min. The formation of the hydrous RuO2 gel was indicated
by change in the color of the template from a red-brown color to black.
After treatment with propylene oxide, the template was placed into
a porcelain crucible and heated to 600 °C in a muffle furnace
for 30 min. Following this heating procedure, the crucible was removed
from the furnace and allowed to cool to room temperature. The samples
were then collected for further analysis.

To deposit small platinum
NPs onto the RuO2 support,
as-synthesized RuO2 NWs (∼2 mg) were dispersed into
1.25 mL of deionized water by sonication for 5 min. The solution containing
the RuO2 NWs was combined with a 1 mL aliquot of a solution
containing dihydrogen hexachloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6, Alfa Aesar, 99+%). The concentration of the H2PtCl6 solution was prepared to yield 20% by mass Pt in
the resulting Pt/RuO2 NWs. The solution containing both
RuO2 and H2PtCl6 was stirred for
5 min before the addition of 1 mL of an aqueous NaBH4 solution
(Alfa Aesar, 98%, 3 mg/mL). The deposition proceeded for a period
of 30 min before the product was collected by centrifugation and washed
