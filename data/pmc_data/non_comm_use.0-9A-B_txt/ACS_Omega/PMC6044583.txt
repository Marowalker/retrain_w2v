A novel
nanostructured hierarchical core–shell nanocomposite
of zirconium hexacyanoferrate (ZrHCF) and a mesoporous nanomaterial
composed of Fe3O4 and carbon nanospheres (denoted
as ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC) was prepared and used as
a novel platform for an aptasensor to detect the epithelial tumor
marker mucin-1 (MUC1) sensitively and selectively. The prepared ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite exhibited good chemical functionality,
water stability, and high specific surface area. Therefore, large
amounts of aptamer molecules resulted in high sensitivity of the developed
electrochemical aptasensor toward traces of MUC1. The constructed
sensor also showed a good linear relationship with the logarithm of
MUC1 concentration in the broad range of 0.01 ng·mL–1 to 1.0 μg·mL–1, with a low detection
limit of 0.90 pg·mL–1. The fabricated ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC-based aptasensor exhibited not only high
selectivity because of the formation of aptamer–MUC1 complex
but also good stability, acceptable reproducibility, and applicability.
The proposed novel strategy based on a newly prepared hierarchical
core–shell nanocomposite demonstrated outstanding biosensing
performance and presents potential applications in biomedical fields.

Introduction
Mucin-1 (MUC1) is a
heavily glycosylated protein that protects
the epithelial tissue in healthy bodies; it is bound to cells by an
integral transmembrane domain through the formation of a gel matrix.
MUC1 contains a hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain with 31 amino
acids, a cytoplasmic domain with 69 amino acids, and an extracellular
domain consisting of a region of nearly identical repeats with 20
amino acids per repeat.1 MUC1 expressed
over the normal level is a well-known tumor marker existing in various
malignant tumors, such as breast, stomach, lung, prostate, and colorectal.2 Therefore, advanced novel analytical techniques
must be developed to monitor the level of MUC1 in patient samples
routinely.

Aptamers are synthetic nucleic acid sequences obtained
through
an in vitro procedure called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment.3 Aptamers exhibit several advantages,
such as conformational change in analyte binding and high specificity
for a single target analyte, including drugs, proteins, carbohydrates,
lipids, and other organic or inorganic molecules.4 Aptamer-based biosensors do not involve the use of animals
and demonstrate improved stability and specificity in various types
of assays, such as electrochemical,5 fluorescence,6 chemiluminescence,7 and colorimetric.8 Aptamer–MUC1
binding has been tested through competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA)9 and surface plasmon resonance
spectroscopy.10 For example, Wu et al.
applied surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectroscopy to “trap”
human breast cancer cells using anti-MUC1 aptamer–Au/Ag nanoconjugates.11 Several electrochemical aptasensors have also
been proposed for the detection of specific cancer antigens, such
as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and vascular endothelial growth
factor.12,13 Among the many approaches, electrochemical
methods are the most suitable method for the development of aptasensors
because of their fast response, high sensitivity, and low cost; in
addition, results can be obtained in real time.

Various signal
amplification strategies have been introduced to
develop highly sensitive electrochemical sensors. In particular, different
nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots, magnetic
NPs, carbon-based nanomaterials, and polymeric NPs, have been used
as electrode materials to construct sensing platforms and carriers
to increase the electrochemical response.14,15 Metal oxides with a core–shell nanostructure have elicited
much attention because they can provide many opportunities for the
development of new composite materials. Large surface area, the presence
of pores, and wide-open geometry present significant advantages in
the synthesis of metal oxides.16 As a typical
nanomaterial, Fe3O4 NPs with high chemical stability,
biocompatibility, and low toxicity have been intensively studied not
only for fundamental scientific interest but also for potential applications
in biomedical fields, especially in targeted drug delivery.17,18 However, the traditional Fe3O4 NPs always
require complicated surface modification to form groups that can connect
with the aptamer strands. Furthermore, they usually exhibit low DNA-anchoring
capability because of their relatively low surface area. To solve
these problems, porous hollow Fe3O4 NPs have
been developed as sensitive materials for DNA sensors to provide a
potential space for DNA immobilization. To improve the suspension
stability of the Fe3O4 NPs further, amorphous
carbon layers are often coated on the surface of Fe3O4 NPs to form Fe3O4@C nanocapsules with
good aqueous dispersity.

As a Zr-based nanomaterial, zirconium
hexacyanoferrate ({Zr[Fe(CN)6]}n, denoted as ZrHCF) has elicited
much interest because of its ionic conductivity, redox properties,
and high affinity for oxygen atoms.19 ZrHCF
is often used as a modifier in the construction of modified electrodes.
The unique coordination of phosphate groups in Zr(IV) results in related
nanomaterials, such as ZrO2 and ZrHCFs, which can be used
to immobilize DNA strands and selectively enrich phosphopeptides as
sensitive materials for biosensing.20 For
instance, magnetic ZrHCF NPs consisting of magnetic beads exhibit
remarkable electrocatalytic properties in the reduction of H2O2 and are used as the signal nanoprobe for the ultrasensitive
electrochemical DNA array.19 The immobilization
system of oligodesoxynucleotides has been successfully developed and
proven on ZrO2 NPs.21 Moreover,
the electrospun ZrO2 nanofibers can serve as a versatile
tool for protein analysis.22 However, no
report has examined the combination of ZrHCF and Fe3O4 nanospheres and its related application in biosensing.

With this consideration, a hollow core–shell nanostructured
composite of ZrHCF and hollow mFe3O4@mC (denoted
as ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC) was designed and synthesized
in this study. The designed composite possesses an inner cavity and
an orderly mesoporous opening structure. Subsequently, the as-prepared
ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite was employed as the
aptasensor platform to detect MUC1 sensitively. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the entire fabrication
procedure of the aptasensor based on the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite involved three steps: (i) preparation of the
ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite, (ii) immobilization
of the aptamer strands, and (iii) detection of MUC1 through the biorecognition
interaction between the aptamer strands and MUC1. The core–shell
nanostructured ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite was
prepared using the hydrothermal method and by using zirconyl chloride
(ZrOCl2) as the precursor and dopamine hydrochloride as
the organic ligand in the presence of hollow mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules, which were obtained after the calcination
of hollow Fe3O4@C nanospheres. The hollow Fe3O4@C nanospheres were synthesized by removing the
SiO2 core from the core–shell SiO2@Fe3O4@C spheres. Therefore, the core–shell
ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite possessed an extremely
large specific surface area and good dispersity. Additionally, the
intensive binding of Zr–O–P between ZrHCF and the aptamer
strands20 induced high immobilization force
in the aptamer strands. Therefore, the developed strategy can be used
to detect traces of analytes, such as MUC1, in human serum.

Results and Discussion
Sensor
Design
For comparison, three nanomaterials,
such as mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC, were used as the platform for aptamer immobilization
and MUC1 detection. Label-free aptamer strands, 5′-(CH2)6-ACA CGG CAG TTG ATC CTT TGG ATA CCC TGG CGT
GT-3′, were designed based on a hairpin with 25 complementary
bases in the loop structure to catch the targeted protein, MUC1.23,24 Prior to use, all MUC1 aptamers were heated and then allowed to
cool to form hairpin oligonucleotide. In the absence of target MUC1,
the immobilized hairpin aptamer was in a “closed” state.
When introducing MUC1, the hairpin oligonucleotide was disrupted and
the aptamer preferred to form the aptamer–MUC1 complex, which
resulted in the electrochemical signal change.25 Because of the large protein MUC1 bringing a steric hindrance
effect on the electrode, it was expected that electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) of the electrochemical aptasensor would increase.26 Considering the high bioaffinity of ZrHCF and
adsorption ability of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC, the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite-based electrochemical biosensor
is expected to demonstrate higher sensitivity toward MUC1 detection
in aqueous solutions than the individual mFe3O4@mC- and ZrHCF-based ones.

Chemical Structure and Components
The elemental composition
and chemical status of mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and
ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposites were investigated
through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the element atomic
percentage is summarized in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. The XPS survey spectra of the three samples are
shown in Figure S1, in which Fe 2p, C 1s,
O 1s, and N 1s were observed, as well as the presence of Zr 3d (2.85%)
in the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite (curve
c, Figure S1). The C 1s peak was due to
amorphous carbon, and Fe 2p and O 1s were derived from Fe3O4 NPs. The Zr 3d peak observed in the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite confirmed the composite of ZrHCF with
mFe3O4@mC. The densities of the C 1s peak were
57.24, 40.05, and 39.67%, whereas those of the N 1s peak were 3.22,
17.15, and 7.85% for the samples of mFe3O4@mC,
ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC, respectively. When
combined with ZrHCF NPs, the high content of N 1s (7.85%) resulted
from the hexacyanoferrate group. To evaluate the chemical environment
of each element, the core-level XPS spectra of C 1s, N 1s, Fe 2p,
and Zr 3d in the three samples were fitted and are summarized in Figure 1. For the C 1s core-level
XPS spectra (Figure 1a1,b1,c1), four components, namely, 284.6, 285.7, 286.4, and 287.6
eV, were fitted out; these components resulted from C–C/C–H,
C–N, C–O, and C=O/N–C=O, respectively.27 The appearance of the C–O and C=O/N–C=O
groups revealed that the Fe3O4@C nanospheres
were only partly calcined in an N2 atmosphere. With regard
to the mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules, the N 1s core-level
spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks of 399.5 and 401.5 eV, which
are attributed to C–N/N–H and N–C=O groups,
respectively (Figure 1a2). In the case of ZrHCF and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC,
however, an additional main peak was observed at 397.6 eV together
with the peaks at 399.5 and 401.5 eV (Figure 1b2,c2). Obviously, this peak is assigned
to the functional group of −N=,28 which was contained in ZrHCF. As for the O 1s core-level XPS spectrum
of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC (Figure S2a), the main peaks at 532.5 eV was contributed to C–O,
which originated from the layer of γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
used for the amino-functionalization of mFe3O4@mC, whereas the peaks at 531.0 and 529.6 eV were assigned to Fe–O–C
and Fe–O groups, respectively,29 which are due to the presence of the Fe3O4 nanospheres. Simultaneously, the peak at 534.6 eV was mainly due
to the presence of C=O contained in the oxidation state of
dopamine, which are formed in the preparation process of ZrHCF.30 With regard to the Fe 2p core-level XPS spectra
(Figures 1a3 and S2b), the peaks at binding energies of 712.1
and 724.8 eV were characteristic of Fe3+, whereas the peaks
at 709.8 and 722.8 eV were due to Fe2+.31 Additionally, the satellite signal at 717.6 eV was due
to the combination of Fe2+ and Fe3+.32 The presence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the samples further confirmed the formation of Fe3O4. Substantial Zr 3d peaks appeared in the sample of
ZrHCF and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite and were
fitted into two components (184.2 and 181.8 eV), which were due to
the Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2 core levels, respectively
(Figure 1b3,c3).33,34 All of these results imply the combination of ZrHCF and hollow mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules.

Crystallization of the
Samples
To reveal the crystal
phase in the nanocomposites, X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were
performed on as-synthesized mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF,
and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC (Figure S3b). The presence of intense peaks corresponding to the (220),
(311), (400), (511), and (440) Bragg reflections of Fe3O4 is in agreement with those reported for Fe3O4 nanospheres (JCPDS file 19-0629, magnetite) (Figure S3a).35 This
result shows that Fe3O4 was formed. The peak
at 19° was attributed to the characteristic peak of amorphous
carbon. With regard to ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC, aside
from the characteristic peaks of Fe3O4 and amorphous
carbon, an additional peak at 8.4° was observed and ascribed
to the element Zr; it is consistent with that of the phase pure UiO-66.36 The XRD results revealed the presence of mFe3O4@mC and ZrHCF in the nanocomposite.

Surface Morphology
of mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF,
and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC
The morphologies
of the as-prepared mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC NPs were investigated with a field emission
scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and a transmission electron microscope
(TEM), as shown in Figures S5 and 2. The surface morphologies of SiO2, SiO2@Fe3O4@C, and hollow Fe3O4@C nanospheres are summarized in Figure S4. The FESEM images indicate that SiO2 and SiO2@Fe3O4@C were uniformly distributed
with the particle sizes of 345.8 and 363 nm, respectively. The obtained
SiO2@Fe3O4@C nanospheres had a rough
surface and were embedded with small NPs. After removing the SiO2 nanospheres, the hollow nanostructure was observed, whereas
some of the hollow nanospheres were crushed. As for the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite, an even rougher surface was
obtained due to the combination of ZrHCF NPs, with a small size of
40–60 nm. In the process of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite formation, the negatively charged ferricyanide
ion [Fe(CN)6]3– was electrostatically
adsorbed on the surface of mFe3O4@mC, which
was modified by the protonation of amines on the surface. Then, [Fe(CN)6]3– was reduced in the presence of dopamine,
and the resulting product [Fe(CN)6]4– reacted with Zr(IV), forming the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite. In addition, the mesoporous carbon with high surface
area and adsorption capacity can enhance the immobilization capability
for dopamine molecules, which can further promote the formation of
ZrHCF NPs on the surface of mFe3O4@mC. Figure S5e,f shows that the obtained ultimate
product ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite has a
rougher surface than that of mFe3O4@mC, which
is in accordance with the TEM image in Figure 2. The TEM image shows that the hollow mFe3O4@mC spheres were nearly monodisperse in size
with an average diameter of 352 nm (Figure S5g,h). The surface of the hollow nanospheres was rough in texture, which
revealed a disordered assembly of particles. The hollow interior of
the particles was confirmed through TEM characterization, which also
detected a strong contrast between the dark edges and the pale central
region (Figure 2a,b).
As shown in Figure 2c,d, the morphology of the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC
nanocomposite was similar to that of mFe3O4@mC.
However, the surface of the former was much rougher than that of the
latter. This difference could have been caused by the deposition of
ZrHCF NPs onto mFe3O4@mC NPs irregularly, which
also helped increase the surface area of the nanocomposite and enhance
the immobilization of the aptamer. The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM)
image in Figure 2e
confirms the 0.253 nm fringe spacing, which corresponds to the (311)
interplanar spacing of the mFe3O4 phase.37 The corresponding diffraction rings of (311),
(400), (422), (511), and (440) in the selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) patterns (Figure 2f) confirmed the formation of mFe3O4, indicating
the nanocrystalline nature of the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite.

Electrochemical Biosensing Performance of
the Three Samples
In the present work, mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and
ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composites were applied as scaffold
substrates for aptamer immobilization to evaluate the efficiency in
detecting MUC1. The assembly steps of MUC1/Apt/mFe3O4@mC/Au, MUC1/Apt/ZrHCF/Au, and MUC1/Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV)
(Figures S6 and S7) and EIS (Figure 3). As shown in Figure S6, the well-defined redox peaks of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– were observed in the bare
Au electrode (curve i, Figure S6). When
the Au electrode was separately modified with mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC (curve
ii, Figure S6), the related redox peak
current decreased markedly. This result indicates that mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC
can significantly reduce the electron transfer that resulted from
the relatively low electrochemical activity. After the immobilization
of aptamer strands on mFe3O4@mC/Au, ZrHCF/Au,
or ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au (curve iii, Figure S6), the peak currents further decreased
probably because the negatively charged aptamer strands increased
the repelling force of the electrode toward the [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– redox probe.38 After incubation with the MUC1 solution, a slight decrease in the
peak current was observed (curve iv, Figure S6). This result may be caused by MUC1 blocking, which was biorecognized
by the aptamer strands via a conformation change to form the aptamer–MUC1
complex between the aptamer strands and MUC1.39,40 These results demonstrate that MUC1 can be determined by the developed
electrochemical aptasensors based on mFe3O4@mC,
ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC. To evaluate the
intrinsic electrochemical behaviors of the electrochemical aptasensors
based on mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC, CV measurements were determined in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.14 M NaCl and
0.1 M KCl) in the absence of [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– redox probe (Figure S7). In the range
of −0.2 to +0.8 V at a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1, all CV curves of three kinds of aptasensors did not show any redox
peak, suggesting that all three electrode materials exhibited usual
electrochemical activity. Therefore, all electrochemical measurements
were performed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–, 0.14 M NaCl, and 0.1 M KCl. Furthermore,
because of the determination limitation of CV measurement, comparing
these three aptasensors is difficult. Thus, corresponding EIS characterizations
were also performed. Figure 3 shows the EIS diagrams for the detection of MUC1 using the
developed electrochemical aptasensors based on mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC in 0.1
M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3–/4–, 0.14 M NaCl, and 0.1 M KCl.

circuit of the Nyquist plot). (d) ΔRct values of each step during MUC1 detection using the fabricated aptasensors

EIS can effectively supply impedance change information
in the
procedure of modifying the surface of an electrode.41 The EIS diagrams were simulated using the Randles equivalent
circuit consisting of solution resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), constant-phase element, and the Warburg impedance (W) (Figure 3a, inset).
The Rct values of all electrodes, including
the modified electrodes with three samples, the aptamer immobilization,
and the MUC1 detection, are summarized in Table S2. The Rct value of mFe3O4@mC/Au is 1.54 kΩ, whereas those of ZrHCF/Au and
ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au are 1.40 and 1.41 kΩ,
respectively. These values indicate that the presence of mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, or ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC
obstructs the electron transfer at the interface between the electrode
and the electrolyte solution.42 However,
the slightly small Rct value of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au implies that ZrHCF can not only increase
the specific surface area but also promote the electrochemical activity
of hollow mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules. All of these
conditions are favorable to aptamer strand immobilization and helpful
for the detection of analytes. The Rct values of the modified electrodes obviously increased to 1.68, 1.60,
and 1.68 kΩ when the aptamer strands were immobilized on mFe3O4@mC/Au, ZrHCF/Au, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au, respectively. The repelling interaction between the
negatively charged aptamer molecules and [Fe(CN)6]3–/4– redox resulted in a high barrier for interfacial
electron transfer, thus confirming that the aptamer was successfully
anchored on the surface of the composite electrodes.19 Meanwhile, the film of mFe3O4@mC,
ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC adsorbed with the
aptamer strands wrapped MUC1 and further prevented the electron from
exchanging between the redox probe and the electrode, thus leading
to increased Rct values of 1.80, 1.67,
and 2.16 kΩ for MUC1/Apt/mFe3O4@mC/Au,
MUC1/Apt/ZrHCF/Au, and MUC1/Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au, respectively.

In principle, the variation in the Rct (ΔRct)
value can represent the
binding amount of the blocking layer,43 indicating that a high amount results in a high ΔRct value. Hence, to compare the detection efficiency of
the different developed strategies, the ΔRct values were calculated from each step in the process of
MUC1 detection (Figure 3d). For the modification step of the bare Au electrode with mFe3O4@mC, ZrHCF, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC, the resulting ΔRct values
were 1.42, 1.23, and 1.35 kΩ, respectively, suggesting the relatively
good electrochemical activity of the ZrHCF NPs. After the immobilization
of the aptamer strands, the ΔRct values of mFe3O4@mC/Au, ZrHCF/Au, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au were 0.144, 0.195, and 0.272 kΩ,
respectively. This result implies that more aptamer strands were anchored
on ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au, subsequently leading
to the highest ΔRct value of 0.482
kΩ when detecting MUC1 because large amounts of immobilized
aptamer strands can provide high sensitivity for detecting analyte
molecules.44 Additionally, the coverage
of aptamer on the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite
was determined by using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The results
showed that the saturated immobilization amount of the aptamer strands
was estimated to be 3.47 × 1013 molecules·cm–2 (see S6). Compared with
the two-dimensional self-assembly sensitive layers (SAMs) for immobilizing
DNA strands, the value of the surface density, 3.47 × 1013 molecules·cm–2, fabricated in the
present work on the basis of the Sauerbrey equation is relatively
higher than the values of the surface density 2.25 × 101245 and 1.4 × 1013 molecules·cm–2.46 As discussed in the
previous work,47 when the aptamer strands
were immobilized onto the three-dimensional hollow nanostructure of
the proposed nanocomposite of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC,
they not only can anchor onto the surface of nanocomposite but also
can penetrate into the interior of the hollow framework because of
their strong affinity. As for the two-dimensional SAMs, DNA can immobilize
only on their surface, leading to the relative lower surface density
of DNA strands.

Meanwhile, the ΔRct value caused
by MUC1 detection using the developed aptasensors based on the hollow
mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules was only 0.122 kΩ
because of the relatively poor anchoring interaction of the aptamer
strands. The presence of ZrHCF improved the detection efficiency of
MUC1. All of these results demonstrate that the proposed Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au biosensor can be employed to determine
MUC1 in aqueous solutions. Therefore, it was used in the subsequent
electrochemical measurements for evaluating the detection limit (LOD),
selectivity, reproducibility, and so on.

The surface chemical
composition variation before and after the
immobilization of aptamer strands as well as the detection of MUC1
was examined through XPS. The XPS survey scans of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt/MUC1
are shown in Figure S1, and the atomic
percentage of each element is summarized in Table S1. The intensities of Zr 3d and Fe 2p contained in ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt substantially decreased from 2.85 to
0.95% and from 7.02 to 1.86%, respectively and then further declined
to 0.63 and 1.30% after the detection of MUC1, that is, ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt/MUC1. In the presence of MUC1, the aptamer–MUC1
complex formation between the protein and the aptamer strands intensified
this trend, further leading to the decrease in the intensity of these
two elements. Moreover, the appearance of P 2p, which originated from
the anchored aptamer strands, can also prove the presence of oligonucleotides
molecules. The high-resolution spectra, which were well-fitted by
using Gaussian line components, for the two samples in C 1s, N 1s,
P 2p, Zr 3d, Fe 2p, and O 1s regions are shown in Figures S8 and S9. The deconvoluted C 1s XPS spectrum of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt includes a peak at 284.6 eV (assigned
to the C–C/C–H bonding sites), one at 285.7 eV (C–N),
one at 286.4 eV (C–O), and one at 287.6 eV (C=O/N–C=O)
(Figure S8a1). In comparison with the C
1s high-resolution spectrum of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC,
the intensity of the C=O/N–C=O groups increased.
However, after the detection of MUC1 using the developed aptasensor
(ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt), a new additional peak
was observed at 292.6 eV corresponding to the N–C(=O)–N
group together with another four peaks in C 1s (Figure S8b1), which originated from the bonding of protein
molecules. The principal N 1s core-level XPS spectrum can be fitted
into three parts of 397.6, 399.5, and 400.6 eV, which are assigned
to −N=, C–N/N–H, and N–C=O
groups, respectively. The intensity of the −N= group
contained in ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt was reduced
by the coverage of the immobilized aptamer strands (Figure S8a2). Furthermore, it disappeared from the N 1s core-level
spectrum of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt/MUC1 because
of the thick layer of the combination of the aptamer and protein molecules
(Figure S8b2). The clear P 2p high-resolution
spectra of the two samples are shown in Figure S8a3,b3. The Zr 3d core-level spectrum of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt reveals a single spin–orbit doublet with
the binding energies of Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 core levels of 181.8 and 184.2 eV, respectively. The same peaks
appeared in ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt/MUC1 but with
a relatively low intensity (Figure S9a1,b1). As for the Fe 2p core-level XPS spectra of the two samples (Figure S9a2,b2), the same results as those of
the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite were observed.
The peaks show low signal intensity because of the immobilization
of the aptamer strands and the adsorption of MUC1. In the case of
O 1s of ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Apt/MUC1 (Figure S9a3,b3), an additional peak of the Zr–O–P group was appeared,
which was not present in the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC
nanocomposite. This hints the formation of covalent bonds of the Zr–O–P
group when the aptamer strands were anchored onto the nanocomposite.20 The peak at 536.1 eV was mainly due to the presence
of H2O. Actually, the DNA strands can be adsorbed not only
on Fe3O4 mainly via the phosphate backbone48 but also on mesoporous carbon via base interaction.49 All of these results show the successful development
of the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC-based aptasensor for
detecting the targeted protein and suggest that it can be used in
the fields of biosensing or diagnosis analysis.

Sensitivity
of the Developed Aptasensors Based on ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC
The sensitivity of the developed
aptasensors based on the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite
was assessed by measuring the dependence of ΔRct on the concentration of MUC1 (CMUC1). Figure 4 shows the Nyquist plots of the electrochemical impedance spectra
for the biosensor with different concentrations of MUC1. The relationship
between ΔRct and CMUC1 is presented in Figure 4b. The ΔRct values substantially increased with increasing CMUC1 within the range of 0.01 ng·mL–1 to 1.0 μg·mL–1. As shown in the inset
of Figure 4b, a linear
relationship was observed between ΔRct and the logarithm of CMUC1 within the
range of 0.01 ng·mL–1 to 1.0 μg·mL–1. The regression equation was ΔRct (kΩ) = 1.37 log CMUC1 + 3.08 (CMUC1: ng·mL–1) with a regression coefficient (R2)
of 0.984. The LOD was calculated to be 0.90 pg·mL–1 based on a signal-to-noise ratio of 3.50 This LOD is lower than those of previously reported biosensors (Table 1).

Selectivity and Stability
of the Proposed Aptasensor
Nonspecific adsorption is a major
problem during the application
of aptasensors. To confirm the observed impedance changes and test
the binding selectivity, control experiments were conducted in the
presence interfered proteins. The proposed aptasensor was exposed
to different protein solutions, such as CEA, immunoglobulin G (IgG),
and bovine serum albumin (BSA), which are important proteins in the
human serum that is 100-fold in MUC1. As shown in Figure 5a, because of the adsorption
ability of the porous ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite,
a certain variation was observed in impedance with the determination
of the interfering components. Furthermore, the selectivity of the
as-prepared aptasensor was determined using the different DNA sequences
for detecting MUC1. The aptasensors based on ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC immobilized with the AptCEA, Aptthrombin, and Aptlysozyme sequences were used for
detecting MUC1 (10 ng·mL–1) separately (Figure S11 and Table S3). These variations can be ignored in comparison with the variation
in Rct caused by the presence of MUC1
based on the AptMUC1/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au aptasensor. The results of two measurements showed that very
low electrochemical signal change was observed, indicating that there
is very weak nonspecific adsorption between the interferences. This
suggests that the developed EIS aptasensor based on the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite has good selectivity.

(b) reproducibility, (c) stability, and (d) regeneration
of the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC-based aptasensor for
the detection of 0.01 ng·mL–1 MUC1 (n = 3).

The reproducibility of
the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC-based
electrochemical aptasensor was evaluated by determining the ΔRct value of the same MUC1 concentration (0.01
ng·mL–1) at five different Au electrodes (Figure 5b). The interassay
relative standard deviation (RSD) of the five aptasensors was 3.28%,
showing acceptable reproducibility. As for the estimation of stability,
the fabricated aptasensor was stored in PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) at 4 °C
for 15 days (Figure 5c). Approximately 96% (RSD = 2.32%) of the initial signal was reserved,
indicating the high stability of the proposed system. The developed
aptasensor was regenerated by incubating 5 mM NaOH solution for 30
min and then washed carefully with PBS. The procedure was repeated
five times continuously (Figure 5d). It is clear that the response signal to the same
concentration of MUC1 can be recovered.

Real Samples
To
investigate the proposed biosensing
system’s practicality, MUC1 in human serum was detected with
the prepared aptasensor of Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au.
Human serum was purchased from Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology
Co., Ltd. The human serum samples were spiked with different amounts
of MUC1 and diluted 100-times with 0.1 M PBS solution (pH 7.4). Then,
the concentrations of MUC1 were assayed by using Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au according to the proposed method, as shown
in Table 2. The measured
results showed that Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au can
detect MUC1 with good average recoveries within the range of 101.5–120.1%
for five measurements, suggesting that the proposed aptasensor based
on ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC exhibits high accuracy and
reproducibility. Therefore, the developed novel strategy can be applied
in the analysis of real samples.

Conclusions
Our
group synthesized a novel nanostructured ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite, which demonstrated good water stability,
biocompatibility, excellent dispersion ability, and strong bioaffinity
toward aptamer strands. When used as the platform material for detecting
the cancer marker protein MUC1 via the biorecognition interaction
and formation of the aptamer–MUC1 complex between the aptamer
strands and MUC1, the fabricated aptasensor based on the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC composite showed high sensitivity to the
traces of MUC1 with a LOD of 0.90 pg·mL–1 within
a broad concentration range of 0.01 ng·mL–1 to 1.0 μg·mL–1. The fabricated aptasensor
also demonstrated high selectivity toward other interfered proteins,
as well as good stability, acceptable reproducibility, and applicability.
The proposed approach provides a new strategy for the detection of
MUC1 and thus shows a great potential for use in point-of-care diagnosis
of genetic diseases and cancer determination.

Experimental Section
Reagents
and Materials
Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III)
[K3Fe(CN)6] and ZrOCl2·8H2O were supplied by Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
Dopamine was purchased from Aladdin Technology Co., Ltd. (China).
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30 wt %), sulfuric
acid (H2SO4, 98 wt %), acetone (C3H6O, 99%), tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%), and ammonia
water (NH3·H2O, 25 wt %) were purchased
from Tianjin Fengchuan Reagent Co. Ltd. (Tianjin, China) and were
of analytical grade. All chemicals were used as received without further
purification. Aqueous solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water (18.2
MΩ·cm) obtained from a Millipore system.

MUC1, CEA,
IgG, BSA, and the aptamers were obtained from Solarbio Life Sciences
Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). The sequence of the MUC1 aptamer strand
is 5′-(CH2)6-ACA CGG CAG TTG ATC CTT
TGG ATA CCC TGG CGT GT-3′ and label-free.24 CEA-targeted aptamer sequence (AptCEA): 5′-SH-CCA
CGA TAC CAG CTT ATT CAA TTC GTG G-3′; thrombin-targeted aptamer
sequence (Aptthrombin): 5′-TCT CTC AGT CCG TGG TAG
GGC AGG GTT GGG GTG ACT-3′; and lysozyme-targeted aptamer sequence
(Aptlysozyme): 5′-NH2-ATC AGG GCT AAA
GAG TGC AGA GTT ACT TAG-3′. PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) was prepared
by mixing Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4. The electrolyte solution was prepared immediately before
use by dissolving 1.650 g of K3Fe(CN)6 and 2.111
g of K4Fe(CN)6 in 1.0 L of PBS. Aptamer solution
(200 nM) and different concentrations of MUC1 (i.e., 0.01, 0.1, 1,
10, 100, 500, and 1000 ng·mL–1) solutions were
prepared in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). All solutions were immediately prepared
before each experiment and stored at 4 °C until use.

Synthesis of
Hollow mFe3O4@mC Nanocapsules
Monodispersed
SiO2 nanospheres (approximately 345.8
nm) were obtained using the Stober method.56 SiO2@Fe3O4@C nanospheres were synthesized
according to a reported method.57 Subsequently,
the SiO2 nanospheres were removed from the SiO2@Fe3O4@C nanospheres by adding 50 mL of NaOH
solution at 55 °C for 5 h. The resultant products were centrifuged
at a speed of 6000 rpm for 10 min to prepare the pure product and
separately washed with Milli-Q water and ethanol three times. The
resulting solid was calcined in nitrogen for 2 h at 500 °C to
obtain hollow mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules. Then,
30.0 mg of mFe3O4@mC and 0.5 mL of γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
were dispersed in 40.0 mL of acetone. The mixture was mechanically
stirred at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, the amino-functionalized
hollow amino-mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules were obtained.

Synthesis of the Core–Shell ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC Nanocomposite
ZrHCF was prepared according to
the procedure described by Dong et al.58 Briefly, 20 mL of HCl (0.03 mol·L–1) was
pipetted into a 100 mL calibrated flask. Then, 40 mL of dopamine hydrochloride
solution (pH 8.4), 40 mL of K3Fe(CN)6 solution
(2.0 g·L–1), and 36 mL of ZrOCl2 solution (2.0 g·L–1) were added in succession
under vigorous stirring for 1 h. The mixture changed gradually from
light yellow to dark red and finally to dark black. The precipitate
was washed separately with Milli-Q water and ethanol three times and
dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. ZrHCF NPs were obtained, which
were stored at 4 °C before use. Furthermore, the ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposite was synthesized by adding as-prepared
hollow amino-mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules (0.1 g)
during the preparation of ZrHCF.

Construction of the Aptasensors
A bare gold electrode
(diameter of 3 mm) was polished with 1.0 and 0.3 μm of alumina
powder, ultrasonically washed in water for 5 min, and dried under
high-purity N2 stream. To compare the biosensing efficiency
of different strategies, the mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules,
ZrHCF NPs, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposites
were dispersed in fresh Milli-Q water to prepare homogeneous dispersions
with a concentration of 1.0 mg·mL–1. Afterward,
the prepared dispersions (10 μL) were deposited on the surface
of pretreated Au electrodes and dried in N2 stream. Subsequently,
the modified Au electrodes with mFe3O4@mC nanocapsules,
ZrHCF NPs, and ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC nanocomposites
were incubated with an aptamer solution separately; they are denoted
as Apt/mFe3O4@mC/Au, Apt/ZrHCF/Au, and Apt/ZrHCF@mFe3O4@mC/Au, respectively. Subsequently, three types
of modified Au electrodes anchored with the aptamer strands were sufficiently
rinsed with PBS and dried over a gentle stream of N2, through
which the developed aptasensors were accomplished and used for the
subsequent measurements. The developed aptasensors were stored at
4 °C in a refrigerator when not in use.

Characterizations
XPS was conducted with a Thermo Fisher
ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with an Al anode (Al Kα
1486.6 eV). XRD patterns were recorded on a D8 ADVANCE Bruker diffractometer
with Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphology of the samples
was conducted with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL, JSM-6490LV)
and a TEM (JEOL, JEM-2100F).

Electrochemical Measurements
All
electrochemical measurements
were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation (Shanghai
CH Instruments Co., China) with a conventional three-electrode system,
which consists of a modified Au working electrode, a KCl-saturated
Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and a platinum auxiliary electrode. The
measurements were performed in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5 mM
K3Fe(CN)6/K4Fe(CN)6 (1:1),
0.14 M NaCl, and 0.1 M KCl. CV curves were recorded between −0.2
and +0.8 V versus Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 50 mV·s–1. EIS plots were obtained in the frequency range of 0.01 Hz to 100
kHz with an alternating current amplitude of 5 mV. The EIS spectra
were analyzed with ZView software (version 2) obtained from Scribner
Associates Incorporated. The software uses nonlinear least-squares
fit to determine the parameters of the elements in the equivalent
circuit. Three parallel experiments were carried out for each measurement,
and their average values were applied in the present work. Error bars
represent standard deviations of measurements taken from three independent
experiments.
