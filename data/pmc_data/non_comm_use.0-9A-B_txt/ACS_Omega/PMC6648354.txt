Nanocarbon-based
materials have excellent properties, including
high electrical conductivity as well as charity-dependent optical
absorption and luminescence; therefore, the materials are promising
in applications for nanoelectric devices, nanophotonics, and so on.
Carbon dots (CDs) are one of the carbon materials recently fabricated.
Optical properties of CDs have been reported to be similar to those
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). For this reason, the CDs
are considered to be composed of PAH. Synthesis of CDs has previously
been accomplished through hydrothermal synthesis and microwave irradiation.
These methods require a long synthesis time, and the processes involve
multiple steps. In this study, we developed a fabrication method of
CDs in simple and spatially selective ways, by using radical reactions
in an organic polymer film with focused electron-beam irradiation.
We investigated various organic polymers as reaction materials and
found that polystyrene has a higher efficiency for CD formation than
other organic polymers investigated. Absorption, photoluminescence,
and Raman scattering properties of the electron-beam-irradiated sample
were in good agreement with those reported for the CDs. The technique
developed in this study is promising for fabricating light-emitting
CDs and photonic crystals in a simple and flexible manner.

Introduction
Nanomaterials, such
as quantum dots,1,2 metal nanorods,3,4 and
nanocarbons5,6 have attracted much attention
because of their unique electrical, mechanical, and optical properties.
Carbon nanomaterials have been extensively studied for their potential
uses in structural elements,7 conductive
materials,8 and light-emitting devices.9,10 Synthesis of carbon dots (CDs) was first reported in 2004,11 and since then, their absorption and luminescence
characteristics have been extensively studied.12−14 CDs are biocompatible
and have low toxicity;15,16 thus, they are promising for
bioelectronics and biolabeling as well.9,17−20

Currently, CDs are mostly fabricated by the bottom-up and
top-down
methods. In the bottom-up method, CDs are chemically prepared by microwave
synthesis,21−23 combustion reactions,24,25 and hydrothermal
synthesis26,27 using sucrose, glucose, and citric acid
as precursors. In the top-down method, CDs are fabricated through
electrochemical oxidation28 and laser ablation29 using carbon rods as precursors. To fabricate
CD-based optical devices such as nanoemitting devices and photonic
crystals, positions of the CDs should be controlled with the subwavelength
resolution. Spatial control of the nanomaterials can be accomplished
by the nanomanipulators. However, it takes a very long time and thus
it is not tractable to construct a two-dimensional assembly. Space-selective
synthesis of the CDs with the subwavelength resolution enables to
fabricate the two-dimensional assembly in a short time with a flexible
manner.

In this study, we synthesize CDs using electron beams
to induce
radical reactions in a polymer and arrange the position of CDs in
a space-controlled manner. We examine preparation of CDs using various
polymers as starting materials. We found that CDs are produced efficiently
from polymers containing phenyl groups. By using this method, we prepared
two-dimensional assemblies of the CDs on a glass substrate. From confocal
imaging of the assembly, we found that the fabricated sample exhibits
very unique optical properties arising from the interactions among
nearby CDs. This method open the way to fabricate light-emitting CDs
and photonic crystals in a space-resolved manner.

Experimental
Section
Figure 1 shows a
schematic of the fabrication protocol of the CD. First, a polymer
film is spin-coated on a glass substrate. The polymer film is then
irradiated by a focused electron beam. The electron beam is raster-scanned
over the sample to prepare a two-dimensional assembly of the CDs.
Organic polymer films used in this study are prepared by polyethylene
(PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). PE (average degree
of polymerization, n ∼ 60) and PP (n ∼ 120) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and PS
(n ∼ 20) was purchased from National Metrology
Institute of Japan. These are used as received without further purification.
For electron irradiation, we used a scanning electron microscope (SEM,
S-3400N; Hitachi). The accelerating voltage and probe current of the
electron beam were 15 kV and <1 nA, respectively. Electron-beam-induced
chemical reactions were controlled by the dose of the electron beam.
Alternatively, we prepared the CDs according to the hydrothermal synthesis27 for characterizations and comparisons of the
CDs prepared in this study. In the hydrothermal synthesis, 2.0 g of
turmeric was dissolved in 10 mL of water and then the mixture was
kept at 200 °C in a Teflon-coated autoclave for 12 h. After cooling
down the solution, large particles were filtered out and then a CD
dispersed solution was obtained.

carbon dots (CDs) using
electron-beam-induced chemical reaction in organic polymer film (left).

The thickness of the polymer films was evaluated
by a contact profiler
(Dektak XT-S; Bruker). Absorption and photoluminescence (PL) properties
of the sample were examined by a UV–vis spectrometer (V-650;
JASCO) and confocal optical microscopy, respectively. For confocal
microscopy, the sample was illuminated by a focused light with an
objective lens (NA = 1.3) and PL from the sample was collected by
the same objective. PL was detected either by an avalanche photodiode
(SPD-050-CTE; Micro Photon Devices) for single-channel measurement
or by a charge-coupled device (iDUS420; ANDOR) equipped with a polychromator
for spectroscopic measurements. To excite the PL, a UV continuous-wave
(cw) laser (λ = 375 nm) was used as the light source. We also
performed Raman spectroscopy to characterize the chemical nature of
the sample. For Raman spectroscopy, a cw laser (λ = 532 nm)
was used as an excitation source. A transmission electron microscope
(TEM; HF-2200; Hitachi) was used to characterize the morphologies
of the prepared CDs.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
absorption spectrum of the electron-beam-irradiated PS film. The spectrum
was obtained by subtracting the absorption spectrum of the reacted
PS film from that of the pristine PS, for elucidating chemically transformed
species. The spectrum shows a peak at around 260 nm, and the tail
of the absorption band extends toward the long wavelength side over
400 nm. The peak at ∼260 nm is ascribable to absorption due
to π–π* transitions of the phenyl rings.30 We also found that the peak intensity generally
increases with electron-beam irradiation time. The increase in the
intensity suggests the formation of new benzene rings resulting from
the electron-beam-induced chemical reactions. The absorption at the
long wavelength region only emerges after the electron-beam irradiation.
Absorption in the longer wavelength side is a typical observation
for π-conjugated compounds, and thus the absorption near the
visible region may imply the formation of the PAHs.31Figure 2b shows an absorption spectrum of the CDs prepared by hydrothermal
synthesis. Similar to the spectral features in Figure 2a, an absorption peak appears around 260
nm and the tail of the absorption band extends toward the visible
spectral region. The spectral profiles in Figure 2a,b indicate the formation of CDs by electron-beam-induced
chemical reactions in the polymer film. We should note that the scattering
contribution in the transmission of light is negligible since the
scattering cross section for the small particle comparable to the
CDs is much smaller than the absorption one.32,33 PS exhibits PL near 280 and 330 nm, which originated from monomer
and excimer of the phenyl group,30 respectively,
and shows negligible PL in the visible-light region. Interestingly,
the electron-beam-irradiated PS does show intense PL in the visible
region in addition to that in the UV region.34 These facts suggest that the chemical species produced by the electron-beam
irradiation show visible PL.

Figure 3a
shows
the PL spectrum of the sample excited by a UV laser (λ = 375
nm). The spectrum shows a PL peak in the visible-light region (∼480
nm). The spectral profile observed in Figure 3a is very similar to that of the CDs shown
in Figure 3b. Excitation
spectra taken by detecting 430 and 480 nm in the Supporting Information
(Figure S1) are in good agreement with
the absorption spectrum in Figure 2a, indicating that the PL is originated from the chemical
species excited at the excited wavelength. We should also note here
that the PL spectrum is not dependent on the excitation wavelength
in the Supporting Information (Figure S2) and hence the radiated photons are not originated from Raman scattering
but from the excited state of the sample. PL quantum yield was determined
to be ca. 20–30%. The PL intensity increases in proportion
to the dose of the electron beam up to 5 mC/cm2, as shown
in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). The result indicates that concentration of the PL species formed
in the polymer can be controlled by the dose of the electron beam.
The dose dependencies of the PL and absorption are nearly identical.
This strongly suggests that the absorption and PL in the visible region
originate from the same chemical species.

The inset shows a zoomed image of the CD.

As discussed so far, electron-beam-irradiated PS exhibits
optical
properties nearly identical with those of the CDs produced by the
other methods.26 To identify the chemical
species generated in the reactions, we performed Raman scattering
spectroscopy for the sample. Figure 4 shows Raman spectra of the pristine and electron-beam-irradiated
PS. Raman spectrum of the pristine PS shows two strong vibrational
bands near 1000 and 1600 cm–1. These Raman bands
are assigned to the breathing modes in the phenyl groups and the stretching
mode of the C=C bond, respectively.35 Raman spectrum of the irradiated PS, however, does not show these
vibrational bands. Instead, two broad Raman bands are observed near
1340 and 1590 cm–1. The band position and their
spectral profiles are both typical for the carbon materials and are
assigned to the D band and G band, respectively.9 Note that the Raman spectral properties of the irradiated
PS are in very good agreement with those of the CDs reported previously.
The fact indicates that the chemical species generated in this study
is attributable to the CDs. Size of the carbon dots was characterized
to be ∼10 nm by TEM images, as shown in Figure 3c,d. High-resolution TEM images show lattice
structures (lattice spacing ∼0.32 nm), similar to the past
studies of the CDs. The fact indicates that the prepared CDs are crystalline
carbon.9

and without (top) electron-beam
irradiation. Excitation wavelength: 532 nm. Electron dose: 5 mC/cm2.

To examine the precursor polymer
dependence of the CD formation,
we performed electron-beam irradiation on PE and PP films under nearly
identical conditions to those for the PS. The dose of the electron
beam was unified to 5 mC/cm2. The PS film thickness was
570 ± 20 nm, and the thicknesses of the PE and PP films were
1.57 ± 0.58 and 2.93 ± 1.78 μm, respectively. Figure 5 shows the PL spectra
of the reacted samples. In Figure 5, the PL intensity was normalized by the thickness
of each polymer. Spectral profiles for these samples are very similar
to each other, whereas there are clear differences in the PL intensity.
The PL intensity for the PS precursor was more than twice compared
to that for the other two. The result may indicate that CD formation
is promoted in the presence of the phenyl group in the polymer film.

wavelength
is 375 nm. Dose of the electron beam is 5 mC/cm2.

Next, we consider the formation
mechanism of the CDs in this study.
Chemical transformation of the organic polymer was initiated by electron-beam
irradiation under a pressure of 30 Pa. Kinetic energy of the electrons
was about 15 keV. Part of the kinetic energy is transferred to electronic
and kinetic excitations of the polymer film. Excited energy is partly
used for chemical transformations and is mostly released by radiative
and nonradiative processes. Quantum yield of the PL is low in general,
and thus most of the energy is released nonradiatively and is converted
to thermal energy of the polymer film.36 For this reason, the temperature of the sample near the irradiated
area should increase locally. The temperature rise caused by the electron-beam
irradiation can be estimated using Castaing’s equation37 as follows 1  where I, V, C, and d represent the irradiation
current, accelerating voltage, thermal conductivity, and electron-beam
diameter, respectively. Using the electron-beam irradiation conditions
(V = 15 × 103 V, I = 300 × 10–12 A, and d =
30 × 10–9 m) and the thermal conductivity of
the PS, 0.14 W/(m K),38 we estimated the
temperature rise of the PS to be about 600 K. The temperature is comparable
to that in the combustion method;24,25 furthermore,
for both methods, radical reactions are expected to be predominated.39 For these reasons, we presume that the CD formation
by the electron-beam method proceeds through chemical reactions similar
to those that occurred during combustion. Namely, the reaction proceeds
from small carbon compounds to the CDs. Initially, the carbon compounds
are transformed into small PAHs. Then, the PAHs are grown in size
by the reactions and finally the nucleations of the PAHs produce the
CDs.39

CDs have been fabricated by
various methods, such as hydrothermal
synthesis,26,27 combustion synthesis,24,25 and microwave irradiation.21,22 These methods require
several reagents and relatively long reaction time, typically 12 h.
The fabrication method developed in this study uses only an organic
polymer film as a precursor, and the fabrication of CDs can be accomplished
in a simple manner within a few seconds. Moreover, concentration of
the CDs can be controlled by the dose of the electron beam. The method
is compatible with fabrication of a two-dimensional CD assembly in
the polymer film, since the fabrication can be performed under SEM.
By adjusting the beam-steering condition of the electron beam, we
fabricated three types of two-dimensional assemblies of the CDs on
the glass substrate. Figure 6 shows PL images of the fabricated sample. PL is excited by
375 nm. Bright parts indicate that the concentration of the CDs is
high. Lattice structures with periodic waves and two-dimensional donut
patterns were clearly visualized in Figure 6b,c, respectively. Fabrication resolution
is mostly limited by scattering of the electrons in the polymer to
several hundred nanometers.34 The refractive
index of carbon materials is typically 2.5 and is thus larger than
that of organic compounds.40 Optical properties
of these assemblies can be interpreted similar to those of photonic
crystals. Therefore, the fabricated assemblies act as organic photonic
crystals with tight light confinement because of the high refractive
index contrast. The method developed in this study enables extending
to fabrication of nano-optical recording, nano-light-emitting diode,
and so on.

Conclusions
We developed a simple CD fabrication method
using electron-beam-induced
radical reactions in a polymer thin film. Absorption and PL properties
of the fabricated sample showed good agreement with those of samples
produced by hydrothermal synthesis reported previously. We also performed
Raman spectroscopy to characterize the chemical nature of the sample
and found that the sample exhibits the D and G bands attributable
to those for the CDs. We used various organic polymers as reaction
precursors and found that the CDs are formed irrespective of the polymer
type. CD formation is most efficient when the phenyl group is present
in the polymer framework. The results indicate that the CD formation
proceeds through radical reactions, similar to those for soot-particle
formation. The method developed in this study enables spatially selective
formation of the CDs with a simple protocol and a shorter time compared
with those of previously reported methods. In addition, the method
is compatible with fabrication of two- and three-dimensional CD arrays
and is therefore promising for applications in nano-light-emitting
devices and photonic crystals.
