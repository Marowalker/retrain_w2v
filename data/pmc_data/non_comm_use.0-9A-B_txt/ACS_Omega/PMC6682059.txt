The
quantities of (5S)- and (5R)-5,6-dihydrothymidine (total DHdThd) in frozen beef liver samples
were compared between those irradiated by an electron beam (EB) and
those subjected to γ-irradiation. DNA extracted from the samples
was enzymatically digested to nucleosides and analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry for total DHdThd and 2′-deoxythymidine (dThd).
Total DHdThd was formed radiospecifically and dose-dependently and
the dose–response curves of the ratio of total DHdThd to dThd
(total DHdThd/dThd) were similar for both the EB- and γ-irradiated
samples. The total DHdThd/dThd was stable after long-term storage
(4 months) at −20 °C and the followed heat treatment in
a microwave oven. The total DHdThd/dThd could be a robust marker and
is equally effective at quantitating both EB- and γ-ray irradiation
history. The irradiation doses of raw beef liver samples were estimated
using the dose–response curves of the total DHdThd/dThd of
other irradiated samples. The ratio of the estimated dose to the actual
dose was 0.74–1.30 in the irradiation range of 4.67–7.62
kGy.

Introduction
Food irradiation may improve hygiene compliance
and shelf life
by controlling microorganisms. Electron beam (EB), γ -ray, and
X-ray are used as irradiation sources.1−3 Food irradiation is approved
in >50 countries, and the quantity of irradiated foods was 405 000
tons in 2005.4,5 In the U.S., irradiation up to
7.0 kGy is approved for pathogen control in meat products without
heat treatment.6 In Japan, however, irradiation
is approved only to delay sprouting in potato. Nevertheless, irradiation
has recently been considered for the elimination of pathogens in raw
beef liver products. Raw beef liver dishes (liver sashimi) and yukhoe
(raw beef dishes) have been popular items at barbecue restaurants
in Japan. Nevertheless, the food-borne illness caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) has occurred sporadically
as a result of consuming these raw beef dishes. Pursuant to a severe
EHEC outbreak resulting from the ingestion of contaminated raw beef
meat or liver dishes in 2011,7 the Ministry
of Health, Labour, and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan revised the edible
raw meat standards in the same year to improve the trimming process.8 In 2012, MHLW banned the sale of raw beef liver
products for liver sashimi and revised the Food Sanitation Act because
the reduction of the risk of EHEC contamination in the beef liver
was effectively impossible. The bacterial pathogens may reside in
the biliary ducts as well as the surface of the livers.8 MHLW also stated that it was prepared to lift
the ban on the sale of raw beef liver products provided that technologies
are developed to confirm that EHEC contamination has been eliminated.
Irradiation is a promising candidate, and investigations into its
efficacy at eradicating EHEC from raw beef liver products are ongoing.

Irradiation history detection methods are required to control food
irradiation properly. Therefore, various methods have been developed.9 Ten official standard methods for the determination
of food irradiation history have been established by Le Comité
Européen de Normalisation (CEN). For fatty meat samples, method
no. EN1785, which detects the radiolytic fat products 2-alkylcyclobutanones
(ACBs), is appropriate.10 However, this
method must be modified for use with low-fat liver and lean meats.
For example, the test solutions may have to be concentrated.11 DNA is universally contained in the low-fat
liver and lean meats, and its content would not be affected by the
difference of individual of animals. Therefore, we have developed
and presented a new method for determining beef liver irradiation
histories by detecting of the sum of (5S)- and (5R)-5,6-dihydrothymidine (total DHdThd) as irradiation-induced
modified nucleosides in DNA.12 Total DHdThd
is a radiolytic product of 2′-deoxythymidine (dThd)13 and was a target antigen for the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay of shrimp irradiation history.14 In this method, the ratio of total DHdThd to thymidine
(total DHdThd/dThd) in DNA is measured by liquid chromatography coupled
to tandem mass spectroscopy (LC–MS/MS) as a marker for irradiation
history. We also improved the speed and efficiency of this method.15 It can successfully determine the irradiation
histories of ground beef and shrimp. The total DHdThd/dThd dose–response
curves nearly overlapped, even though the samples were derived from
different individual animals. Furthermore, the total DHdThd/dThd of
irradiated samples was stable even after freezing storage for ≥100
days. This exhibit that total DHdThd/dThd would not be affected by
the differences of quality of DNA obtained from samples.

In
certain irradiation history determination methods, the markers
(signals and peak responses) are affected by the differences in sample
composition and irradiation source. For the thermoluminescence (TL)16 and photostimulated luminescence (PSL)17 methods, the TL glow ratio and the PSL signal
counts vary with the sample silicate content even when the same kinds
of foods are being analyzed.18,19 The analysis output
also varied with the irradiation source.18−20 Gadgil et al.
also reported that the relative efficiency of ACB formation in raw
beef patties would differ between EB- and γ-irradiated samples.21 However, variations in the marker type between
methods should not hinder irradiation history determination and may
provide information about the sample production areas. Nevertheless,
these variations make it difficult to estimate the actual irradiation
dose of the sample when it is compared with a standard sample whose
irradiation dose has been certified. EN1786 is an electron spin resonance
(ESR) method used to detect the free radicals formed in meat with
bone in response to irradiation.22 EN1786
may estimate the irradiation dose by extrapolation, which involves
stepwise-dosed sample reirradiation.23,24 Using the
currently available technology, it would be difficult to determine
post-shipment food irradiation doses. However, total DHdThd/dThd is
a robust irradiation history marker that may be able to estimate sample
irradiation doses by comparing them with standard samples. To examine
the ability of this method, we compared total DHdThd/dThd between
EB- and γ-irradiated raw beef liver samples, examined the effects
of heat treatment before DNA extraction on total DHdThd/dThd, and
then estimated the irradiation doses of raw and heat-treated beef
liver samples using the dose–response of other raw beef liver
samples.

Materials and Methods
Beef Liver Samples
Fresh beef liver
(BL) samples derived
from three animals were obtained from three retail markets in Osaka,
Japan on different days and were designated as Liver I, Liver II,
and Liver III, respectively. The organs were sliced into plates and
wrapped in a food-grade poly(vinylidene chloride) (PVDC) film. The
length, width, height, and weight of each plate were ∼40 mm,
20 mm, 5 mm, and 10 g, respectively. The plates were placed in a plastic
dish (100 mm diameter, 20 mm height; AGC Techno Glass Co. Ltd., Shizuoka,
Japan) and stored at −20 °C until irradiation.

Chemicals
Total DHdThd was purchased from Berry &
Associates Inc. (Dexter, MI). The standard for total DHdThd consisted
of 85% (5S)- and 15% (5R)-isomers
and the total DHdThd was expressed as the sum of these isomers. Sodium
iodide (NaI), dThd, proteinase K, and nuclease P1 were obtained from
Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) and snake venom phosphodiesterase I (SVPD) were obtained from
Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany) and Sigma-Aldrich Corp.
(St. Louis, MO), respectively. The other chemicals used were the highest
commercially available grade.

Irradiation
γ-Irradiation
was conducted at the
radioisotope centers of Osaka Prefecture University, Japan, using 60Co (2.7 kGy/h). EB-irradiation was conducted at the Kumatori
Works of Nuclear Fuel Industries, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The planned
irradiation doses were 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 8 kGy, respectively. The
EB energy was 10 MeV, and the irradiation rates at each planned dose
were 4 MGy/h (0.5 kGy), 8 MGy/h (1 kGy), 16 MGy/h (2 kGy), and 40
MGy/h (5 and 8 kGy), respectively. The wrapped livers were placed
in the plastic dish described above and stored at −20 °C
at least overnight until immediately before irradiation. Both γ-
and EB irradiation were conducted in a freezing mixture consisting
of ice and NaCl (−20 to −17 °C) and on dry ice,
respectively. The actual irradiation doses were determined with radiochromic
film dosimetry patches (FWT-60-1P; Far West Technology, Inc., Goleta,
CA) placed on both sides of the dishes (total two radiochromic films
placed per a dish). To avoid the influence of humidity, each film
was placed in a plastic bag. The batch calibration of the film was
performed at −20 °C before using the films by irradiating
them with already calibrated alanine dosimeters (Harwell Dosimeters,
Oxfordshire, U.K.) from 0 kGy up to 11 kGy.

After irradiation,
the samples were stored at −20 °C until further analysis.
DNA was extracted within 22 days after irradiation, except for part
of Liver III. The parts of Liver III, which were EB- or γ-irradiated,
were stored at −20 °C for >4 months before DNA extraction
(Liver III stored) or heat-treated prior to DNA extraction (Liver
III heated) to determine the stability of total DHdThd/dThd to storage
and heat treatment. The analysis of total DHdThd in each BL sample,
including Liver III stored and Liver III heated, was conducted three
times.

Heat Treatment of Beef Liver Samples
The frozen samples
were thawed in a refrigerator (4 ± 1 °C) overnight and ∼10
g samples were heat-treated in a 100 mL glass beaker covered with
a PVDC film in a conventional microwave oven (NE-N2; Panasonic Corp.,
Osaka, Japan) at 170 W for 180 s. The core temperatures of the samples
were measured with a food thermometer. Changes in the sample weight
following heat treatment were recorded to estimate moisture loss.

DNA Extraction
Sample DNA was extracted according to
the method described by Wang et al., with minor modifications.25 Briefly, 1.0 g samples of the raw or heat-treated
beef livers were placed in a 15 mL polypropylene (PP) tube (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) containing 2 mL lysis solution consisting of 10 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 0.32 M sucrose, and 1% Triton X-100.
The samples were homogenized with a TissueRuptor (QIAGEN, Venlo, The
Netherlands) and centrifuged at 10 000g and
4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant was removed and the sediment
was rinsed twice with lysis solution and resuspended in 2 mL extracting
solution consisting of 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Then, 1 μL RNase A solution
(20 μg/mL) was added and the samples were incubated at 37 °C
for 10 min. Next, 80 μL proteinase K solution (20 mg/mL) was
added to the samples and they were incubated at 55 °C for 60
min. For the heat-treated samples, the suspensions were also shaken
and centrifuged at 10 000g and 4 °C for
10 min with 2 mL chloroform to remove impurities.

After centrifugation
of nonheat-treated samples or heat-treated samples, the supernatant
was transferred to a new 15 mL PP tube, to which 3 mL NaI was added.
The tube was then shaken gently. Equal volumes of isopropanol were
added to the samples, and the tubes were gently shaken and then incubated
at −80 °C for 10 min. The mixtures were centrifuged at
10 000g and 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant
was removed, and the precipitated DNA was rinsed with 40% isopropanol
followed by 70% ethanol, dried, and redissolved in 1.8 mL water. Then,
0.2 mL of 5 M NaCl was added to the DNA solution followed by 4 mL
of ice-cold ethanol to precipitate the DNA. After rinsing with 70%
ethanol and lyophilization with a centrifugal evaporator (CVE-3110
& UT-2000; Tokyo Rikakikai Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), the DNA was
dissolved in 0.25 mL of water and the absorbances of the solution
were measured at 230, 260, 280, and 340 nm.

Preparation of Test Solutions
and LC–MS/MS Analysis
DNA was digested with nuclease
P1, ALP, and SVPD to nucleosides,
and the subsequent test solution was prepared as previously reported.15 The concentration ratio of the total DHdThd
to dThd in the test solution (total DHdThd/dThd) was calculated and
used as an irradiation marker. The conditions of the LC–MS/MS
were the same as those previously reported.15

Estimation of Irradiation Dose
Computational irradiation
doses were estimated from dose–response curves of other samples.
The least-squares method calculated the dose–response curve
equation as follows 1  where y represents
the total
DHdThd/dThd and x represents the actual irradiation
dose in kGy determined by radiochromic film dosimetry. The values a and b are constant. Estimated sample
irradiation doses were calculated from eq 1 using their observed total DHdThd/dThd. The
ratios of the estimated irradiation doses [calculated from eq 1] to the actual irradiation
doses (measured by radiochromic film dosimetry) were calculated. Analyses
were performed using PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Quarry Bay, HK).
The ratios of the average of estimated irradiation doses (n = 3) calculated by eq 1 to the average of actual irradiation doses (n = 2) were calculated. Additionally, the average and standard
error of the mean (SEM) of the 10 ratios (EB or γ irradiated
BL samples, Liver I, Liver II, and Liver III including Liver III stored
and Liver III heated; n = 10) were also calculated
at each planed irradiation dose (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 8 kGy).

Results
DNA Extraction
from Beef Liver Samples
The post-irradiation
BL sample storage periods and the sample DNA yields are listed in Table 1. The DNA extraction
time and the average yield were ∼5 h and ∼2.4–3.4
mg/g, respectively. The DNA yields for the EB- and the γ-irradiated
BL samples were very similar. Obvious change in DNA yield was not
observed even after >4 months storage at −20 °C (Liver
III stored). However, heat treatment reduced DNA yield in the Liver
III (Liver III heated) by nearly 50% relative to the liver sample
before heat treatment. After heat treatment, the Liver III heated
sample darkened in color and its weight was ∼65% that of the
sample before heat treatment because of moisture loss. Chloroform
had to be added to the heat-treated liver samples to remove the dark-colored
impurities. The time required to extract the DNA from the heat-treated
samples and their average DNA yield were ∼6 h and ∼1.8
mg/g, respectively.

Total DHdThd/dThd in the EB- and γ-Irradiated Beef Liver
Samples
Total DHdThd was formed in a dose- and radiation-dependent
manner both for the EB and γ-irradiated BL samples. For nonirradiated
BL samples, detectable peaks (signal to noise ratio >3) of (5S)- and (5R)-5,6-dihydrothymidine were
not observed. Chromatograms of 4.87 kGy EB and 4.73 kGy γ-irradiated
Liver I are shown in Figure 1 and they do not visibly differ between samples. The ratio
of the (5S)-isomer to (5R)-isomer
was ∼85:15 in both samples. The dose–response curves
of the total DHdThd/dThd as a function of irradiation dose were similar
for EB- and γ-irradiated Liver I, Liver II, and Liver III (Figure 2). Therefore, the
total DHdThd/dThd did not vary with the irradiation source. The total
DHdThd/dThd dose–response curves for EB- and γ-irradiated
samples were also similar for Liver I, Liver II, and Liver III.

(5S)-DHdThd and (5R)-DHdThd, respectively.
Retention times of (5S)-DHdThd, (5R)-DHdThd, and dThd were 4.8, 5.5, and 7.4 min, respectively. For
total DHdThd analysis, test solutions were used undiluted for LC–MS/MS
analysis. For dThd analysis, test solutions were first diluted 1.0

Stability of Total DHdThd/dThd in the Irradiated Beef Liver
Samples
The total DHdThd/dThd dose–response curves
for the EB- and γ-irradiated BL samples were nearly constant
after a 4 months freezing storage and heat treatment (Figure 3). The core temperature of
the samples heat-treated by a microwave oven (Liver III heated) was
>75 °C at 45 s and 90 °C at 60 s. After 180 s of microwave
heating, the temperature at the center of the sample was steady at
90–95 °C. The total DHdThd generated from the DNA of heat-treated
samples was only ∼55% that of the untreated samples (Liver
III). The dThd produced from the DNA of the sample was also only ∼55%
that of the untreated samples. Therefore, total DHdThd/dThd was virtually
unchanged.

irradiation dose (0–2.0 kGy). Total DHdThd: the sum of (5S)-DHdThd and (5R)-DHdThd/dThd: 2′-deoxythymidine:

Estimation of the Irradiation
Dose of Beef Liver Samples
The dose–response curves
were similar for the irradiated BL
samples that were heat-treated and for those that were frozen for
long-term storage. Therefore, the estimation of the irradiation dose
of samples from the dose–response curve of other samples was
examined. The dose–response curve of EB-irradiated Liver I
was adopted as a calibration curve. The parameters (a, b, and r2) of this
calibration curve of eq 1 were 0.297, 0.025, and 0.997, respectively. The ratios of the estimated
irradiation doses calculated by eq 1 to the actual irradiation doses are listed in Table 2. Estimation error
decreased with the increasing irradiation dose. The ratios in the
low irradiation range (0.25–1.93 kGy) and the high irradiation
range (4.67–7.62 kGy) were 0.23–1.77 and 0.74–1.30,
respectively. The average and SEM of the 10 ratios calculated at each
planed irradiation dose (0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 8 kGy) were 0.78–1.11
and 0.03–0.15, respectively.

Discussion
The
efficacy of this method depends on the amount and quality of
DNA extracted from the samples. In a previous report, phenol–chloroform
extraction and 50% ethanol precipitation were adopted to extract DNA
from BL samples.12 This procedure extracts
fair quantities of DNA from BL samples (∼1 mg/g). However,
the entire process required ≥2 days. To reduce DNA extraction
time and labor, we used NaI as a chaotropic agent to extract DNA in
the present study. In this way, the DNA yield was ∼2–3×
higher than that of the former method and the extraction time was
reduced to 5–6 h. Debris generated from sample heat treatment
was removed by chloroform wash. This methodology may be the most suitable
for DNA extraction from BL samples to determine irradiation histories.

Total DHdThd may be a radiospecific product from dThd as it is
not detected in nonirradiated BL samples and is also not formed during
experimental processes including DNA extraction and its digestion
to nucleosides to prepare the test solution for LC–MS/MS analysis.
One of the well-studied modified nucleosides formed by irradiation
of DNA, 8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo), can be formed
via oxidation with reactive oxygen species during the experimental
process.26,27 At the point of radiospecificity, total
DHdThd may be a more reliable marker of irradiation history than 8-oxo-dGuo.

The ratio of (5S)-DHdThd to (5R)-DHdThd was ∼85:15 in both the EB and γ irradiated
BL samples for all irradiation doses. The reaction mechanism for the
conversion of dThd in aqueous solution to total DHdThd by irradiation
is reportedly as follows;28−31 dThd reacts with the dThd anion radical, following
protonation at the C6 position to form the 5,6-dihydrothymidine-5-yl
radical (5-yl radical), and the addition of hydrogen at C5 of the
5-yl radical to give (5S)-DHdThd or (5R)-DHdThd. The production efficiency of either (5S)- or (5R)-DHdThd depends on further radical reactions
occurring at the 5-yl radical. The production efficiency of (5S)-DHdThd may be advantageous compared to that of (5R)-DHdThd in the DNA double helix. In the case of irradiation
of dThd solution, the production efficiency of either (5S)- or (5R)-DHdThd was almost the same.12 In this study, the isomer ratio was almost the
same between the γ- and the EB-irradiated BL samples. This observation
supports the assumption that the mechanism of the formation of total
DHdThd is the same between the γ- and the EB-irradiated BL samples.
The total DHdThd is produced from dThd in aqueous solution by the
indirect effects of irradiation.28−31 The efficiency of total DHdThd
formation may depend on the amount of H2O in the vicinity
of the DNA. Therefore, water loss may reduce the amount of total DHdThd
generated by DNA irradiation. In our pilot study using fresh and dried
red pepper samples, the efficiency of total DHdThd from fresh samples
was ∼2× greater than that of dried samples when both were
irradiated under the same conditions (details will be published elsewhere).
The isomer ratio was almost identical to that of the commercially
obtained total DHdThd standard. Thus, the quantitation of total DHdThd
was possible without a complicated process by LC–MS/MS analysis.

The dose–response curves of Liver I–III irradiated
by EB and γ-rays nearly overlapped. Both the EB at 10 MeV and
the γ-ray applied in the present study have low linear energy
transfer and are deeply penetrating. Therefore, the efficiency of
total DHdThd formation could depend mainly on the radiation dose.
First, DNA is found in all BL samples and its content is similar for
samples derived from different animals. Second, total DHdThd forms
from the indirect effects of dThd irradiation.

The TL intensity increase and the PSL signal counts may decrease
during the storage and heat treatment.32 Certain radicals detected by ESR may be stable enough to distinguish
samples even 12 months after irradiation.33 Many radicals rapidly decay initially then gradually decay thereafter.
Radical decay is influenced by heat treatment and humidity.22,34 ACB content in irradiated samples may also change during storage
and heat treatment.35,36 However, total DHdThd/dThd was
stable in samples stored at −20 °C for 4 months then heat-treated.
MHLW reported that the core temperature of foods at risk of contamination
with pathogens including EHEC must be maintained at 75 °C for
≥1 min. In the present study, irradiated Liver III was heat-treated
in a microwave oven such that the aforementioned MHLW criteria were
met. However, the DNA yield and the amount of nucleosides derived
from the DNA were reduced by ≤50% compared to the unheated
samples. DNA yield may have been caused by DNA damage, protein denaturation,
inhibition of DNA extraction, and chloroform treatment. The release
of nucleosides from DNA may be impeded by DNA damage and impurities
formed during heat treatment. However, both total DHdThd and dThd
decreased to the same degree in the heat-treated samples, so the total
DHdThd/dThd was unchanged. The stability of this ratio in test solutions
is indicative of the robustness of this method.

The sample irradiation
dose could be estimated by comparing the
total DHdThd/dThd with that of another sample. The irradiation dose
was reasonably estimated from the equation derived from the dose–response
curve of EB-irradiated Liver I. In the high irradiation ranges (4.67–7.62
kGy), the irradiation dose could be estimated from the dose–response
curve of another irradiated sample to within the ratio of 0.74–1.30
to the actual dose. The average ± SEM of the 10 ratios (EB or
γ irradiated BL samples, Liver I, Liver II, and Liver III including
Liver III stored and Liver III heated) at the planned irradiation
dose of 5 and 8 kGy corresponding to high irradiation ranges were
0.88 ± 0.03 and 1.03 ± 0.05, respectively. Meanwhile, the
estimated doses varied widely at the low irradiation range (0.25–1.93
kGy) because of the slightly concave shape of the dose–response
curves. Moreover, this estimate was virtually unaffected by differences
in the irradiation source, storage period, and heat treatment and
is a decided advantage of this method. Only a few reports that could
estimate the irradiation dose of the sample can be found.23,24,37 With certain exceptions published
by the World Health Organization (WHO), the maximum recommended irradiation
dose is set to 10 kGy.38 The approved maximum
irradiation dose for frozen meat product is 7.0 kGy in the U.S.6 However, no suitable method of estimating the
irradiation dose has been established. The methods of determining
irradiation history established by CEN only identify irradiated samples.
In contrast, the new method proposed herein would facilitate the direct
measurement of irradiation doses in foods. This method could be applicable
to the examination of irradiation dose of foods with the approved
maximum irradiation around 4.5–7.5 kGy to control the limit
of irradiation dose properly. Ideally, the ratio of the estimated
dose to the actual dose could be closer to 1.00. However, the difference
of ratio to 1.00 might continuously persist as the actual irradiation
dose was determined by a well-controlled radiochromic film dosimetry
and total DHdThd/dThd in the BL samples were determined by experimental
procedures. To decrease the difference in the ratio to 1.00, the reduction
of the experimental variation will be required. For instance, using
the surrogate of total DHdThd may be effective; studies for improving
the experimental procedure using the surrogate of total DHdThd are
ongoing in our laboratory.

Conclusions
Total DHdThd/dThd may
be a robust, radiospecific, and dose-dependent
marker of BL irradiation history. The total DHdThd/dThd dose–response
curve was not affected by differences in individual animals, irradiation
source, sample storage period, or heat treatment. In view of its robustness,
then, the dose–response curves of previous samples could be
used to estimate the irradiation doses of current ones. This method
may be the first which enables the direct determination of irradiation
doses in foods.
