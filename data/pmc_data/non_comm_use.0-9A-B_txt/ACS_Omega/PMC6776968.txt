A new
class of blue light-emitting bowl-shaped mesogens with the
thiacalix[4]arene core appended with 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives
having peripheral alkoxy side chains have been synthesized and well
characterized. The liquid crystalline behavior of present synthesized
derivatives was examined by optical polarizing microscopy, differential
scanning calorimetry, and X-ray diffraction studies. It was observed
that these thiacalix[4]arene derivatives were capable of stabilizing
the observed Colh phase with a higher temperature range.
The cone-shaped thiacalix[4]arene-based liquid crystals with peripheral
alkoxy side chains able to pack into the columns with enriched intermolecular
interactions and thermal behavior. All derivatives showed blue luminescence
in solution, solid thin-film, and gelation state. The hexagonal columnar
phase and emissive nature of thiadiazole-based thiacalixarene compounds
having xerogel behavior make them favorable in the application of
emissive electronic display devices. The electrochemical properties
of these thiacalixarene-based compounds demonstrate the effect of
alkyl side chain on the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels and also exhibited lower
electron band gaps. The electroluminescence behavior of the compound 10c was examined as emissive layers in the fabrication of
organic light-emitting diodes.

==== Body
Introduction
In recent years, the
liquid crystal of self-organizing molecular
systems with multifunctional properties is one of the most attractive
and active fields of current research. Liquid crystals with inherent
properties like fluidity and stability have been already used in several
commercial applications.1 There are several
types of liquid crystalline compounds, one of the most fruitful compound
is the supramolecular columnar liquid crystal. Supramolecular assembly
composed of disc-shaped aromatic molecules has gained significant
attention, as it is potentially viable to the formation of columnar-type
structures with the presence of Π–Π stacking interactions.2 Presently, the demand of organic semiconductors
with high mobility and strong luminescence has grown manifolds as
they facilitate in the development of various electronic display applications
such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic light-emitting
transistors (OLETs), and organic lasers.3,4

OLEDs
are monolithic solid-state devices that typically consist
a series of organic thin films sandwiched between two thin-film conductive
electrodes which display a substantial part in the growth of new flat-panel
displays.5,6 Small OLED panels are used for the displays
of mobile phones, while large OLED panels are popular in displays
of television, mirror display, transparent display, and signage.7−9 Nowadays, it is accepted that OLEDs will become the governing technology
in the display market. For the fabrication of OLED products, three
phosphorescent emitters are required, red, green, and blue emitters.10−12 Literature reports several materials that emit red and green light;
however, those with blue light emission are rare. Additionally, the
lifetime of green and red phosphorescent devices is higher as compared
to the blue fluorescent device. Nowadays, among these three light-emitting
phosphorescent compounds, blue light-emitting compounds are getting
much more attention because of their indispensable requirement for
the fabrication of white light-emitting diodes and other devices,
respectively.13−17 In addition, columnar hexagonal liquid crystals that are formed
by the packing of central benzene cores one above the other with substitution
of the peripheral side chain which behave as molecular wires that
help to stabilize the Colh phase in one-dimension.18−21

From the previous study, there are various kinds of liquid
crystalline
compounds based on 1,3,4-oxadiazole which were reported in the literature.
Basically, 1,3,4-oxadiazoles are one of the class of heterocyclic
compounds which are known for their many advantages like high-fluorescence
quantum yield, thermal stability, luminescence efficiency, hydrolytic
stability, electron-transporting behavior. Therefore, they found more
applications in the fabrication of n-type electroluminescent layers
in OLEDs.22−24 In addition to the number of advantages of oxadiazole
core-based liquid crystals, there are certain drawbacks like narrow
temperature range, lower solubility, and higher melting and clearing
temperatures which limit their applications in various fields.25 In present investigation, we have focus on 1,3,4-thiadizole
derivatives which have similarities with 1,3,4-oxadiazole expect hetero
atoms in their core structure. The oxygen atom in oxadiazole is interchanged
by sulfur atoms which enhance its properties like higher melting and
clearing temperatures, dipole moments, higher viscosity, and mesophase
temperature range.26 In the literature,
different shapes of fluorescent liquid crystals based on 1,3,4-thiadiazole
are reported till date but very few with polycatenar LCs, star-shaped
LCs, and supramolecular LCs.27−33 In the present study, we report the OLED device performance by using
newly synthesized supramolecular columnar hexagonal mesogens based
on thiacalix[4]arene derivatives substituted with 1,3,4-thidiazoles
derivatives. Its photophysical behavior suggests that the grating
of thiadiazole derivatives on two sides of the thiacalix[4]arene core,
which having a sulfur-rich environment can help to disperse the emitting
nature of thiadiazole derivatives in the thiacalixarene core, respectively.

Calixarenes are the class of cyclic oligomers in supramolecular
chemistry formed via condensation of phenol and aldehydes which currently
belongs to the part of third generation after crown ethers and cyclodextrins.34 The first liquid crystalline compounds based
on the calixarene core were reported by Dalcanale et al.35 In recent years, calixarenes have been successfully
introduced as a central tetra cyclic core with hydrophobic and hydrophilic
sides to design different types of mesogens.36,37 Menon et al. introduced an aliphatic side chain inbuilt with different
linking groups on the calixarene core.38,39 Yang and his
co-workers reported various calixarene-based liquid crystalline materials
with different temperature range and thermal stability.40−44 Among them, our research group also reported various calix[4]arene-based
hexagonal columnar LCs with good photophysical behavior.45,46 Marcos et al. reported calix[4]arene-based mesogens inbuilt with
the Schiff base linking unit.47

In
contrast, new functions remain to be developed through the substitution
of bridge methylene groups by hetero atoms.48 Thiacalix[4]arene, the new member of the calixarene family has now
become a robust scaffold in supramolecular chemistry and material
science.49 They possess many fascinating
features such as large cavity size, binding ability toward anion,
cation and transition metals with the presence of larger cavity, and
also the possibility of multiple chemical modifications on their morphology.
Different functionalizations on the thiacalixarene core have been
extensively used in different applications like mimicking of molecular
logic gates, separating biological important citations, display, and
photoactive emissive compounds.50−52

Supramolecular gels from
Π-conjugated low-molecular weight
gelators have attracted intense interest because of their advantages
to create various superstructures, diversity, and forming self-assembly.53 Specifically, low-molecular Π-conjugated
gelators based on macrocyclic structures into the oligomers like crown
ethers, cyclodextrin, and calixarene effectively prevents the close
packing of the molecules.54 Among various
macrocyclic compounds, calix[4]arenes are of more interest because
of their ability to be functionalized on lower and upper rim, Π–Π
interactions, and formation of self-assembly. From the literature,
it can be noted that thiacalix[4]arene-based compounds which can act
as a gelators are rarely reported.55 Formation
of gels via H-bonding consisting of the functional groups like amide,
aroyl hydrozone, peptide, and sugars is well reported.56,57 An extensive literature survey that revealed no supramolecular thiacalix[4]arene-based
columnar mesogens with blue luminescence and gelation properties have
been reported. In present investigation, we report four new cone-
or bowl-shaped luminescent supramolecular LCs based on thiacalix[4]arene
and 1,3,4-thiadiazole Schiff base group inbuilt with a variable peripheral
alkyl chain to determine their structure–property-relationship.
Furthermore, their electrochemical, density functional theory (DFT),
and photophysical behaviors were implemented to shed light on their
electronic molecular structure. Further, the bowl-shaped di-substituted
thiadiazole thiacalix[4]arene-based columnar liquid crystalline derivatives
(10c, 10d) also showed gelation properties
in nonpolar solvents which are formed by Π–Π interactions
and also the presence of H-bonding.

Result and Discussion
Synthesis
and Characterization
The synthetic strategy
to prepare thiacalixarene derivatives based on 1,3,4-thiadiazole and
thiacalix[4]arene derivatives is presented in given Schemes 1 and 2. Compound 2 was prepared by refluxing the reaction
mixture of compound 1 with hydrazine hydrate in pyridine.46 Further, compound 2 is dissolved
in pyridine and reacted with 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzoyl chloride to
achieve compound 3. The obtained compound 3 is further reacted with phosphorous pentasulfide (P2S5) to give the thiadiazole derivative (4).46 On further heating to compound 4 in the presence of anhy. AlCl3 in benzene resulted in
compound 5.46 Compound 5 was coupled with different alkyl bromides to get compound 6a–6c.46 Further, the oxidation
of compound (6a–6d) was carried out with chromyl
chloride in the presence of pyridine and dichloromethane (DCM) to
form compounds (7a–7d).46 The Schiff-base derivatives (8a–8d) were formed
by the reaction of compound (7a–7d) with 2,4-dihydroxy
aniline.47 Base-catalyzed condensation
of 4-tert-butyl phenol and sulphur powder (S8) in the presence of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether in
a single step to obtain 4-tert-butyl thiacalixarene
(9) is depicted in Scheme 2.58 Finally, the target
bi-substituted supramolecular derivatives (10a–10d) were synthesized by the reaction of Schiff-base thiadiazole intermediates
(8a–8d) with bis-alkyl bromide thiacalix[4]arene
(9) in dimethylformamide (DMF).59 The obtained final solid derivatives were further purified through
column chromatography with chloroform and methanol as eluent in the
ratio of 4:1. Molecular structural characterizations of intermediates
and final target compounds were carried out by using 1H
NMR, 13C NMR, IR, and ESI-HRMS which are presented in the Supporting Information (see in Supporting Information). From the 1H NMR, compounds 10a–10d exhibited a pair of singlets for the −C(CH3)3 group on the thiacalixarene core with the presence
of two singlets for aromatic hydrogen indicates the substitution of
thiadiazole Schiff-base derivatives on lower rim to form stable cone
confirmation that displays columnar hexagonal liquid crystalline properties.48,60 Literature reports confirm the substitution of thiadiazole on two
sides of thiacalixarene-favored cone confirmation.48 Additionally, the difference of the observed two singlets
of the aromatic proton in final target compounds is nearly 0.37 ppm,
which again confirms the cone confirmation of synthesized supramolecular
derivatives.49−52

TGA Analysis
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the
compounds (10a–10d) were performed to verify thermal
stability under the nitrogen atmosphere. The TGA curves for all four
derivatives show similar decomposition behavior (Figure S1, see in Supporting Information). All the compounds (10a–10d) displayed thermal stability up to ≈291
°C with decomposition temperatures above 480 °C. Additionally,
there was no loss of mass up to 180 °C suggesting the absence
of water or any additional solvent molecules trapped during the exposition
of the mesophase. Moreover, the degradation of the prepared thiacalixarene-based
derivatives is in the range of 240–310 °C, which indicates
its good thermal stability behavior.

DSC Analysis
The
phase transition temperature of synthesized
compounds 10a–10d was preliminarily studied by
the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. The observed
transition temperature range of target compounds was investigated
by DSC on first heating and cooling rates of 10 °C (Figure 1). The corresponding
data of transition temperature and enthalpy change were summarized
in Table 1. Upon heating
and cooling conditions, all four derivatives exhibited two endothermic
peaks on heating and cooling conditions corresponding to crystal to
columnar hexagonal and columnar hexagonal to isotropic phase (Figure S2). Compound 10a with lower
alkyl chain showed two endothermic peaks at 101.2 and 197.6 °C
on heating conditions. On cooling, they traced two endothermic peaks
at 198.8 and 103.2 °C. Likewise, compound 10b showed
two endothermic peaks at 96.4 and 161.9 °C on heating and similar
broad endothermic peaks traced at 162.9 and 98.1 °C for cooling
conditions. Similarly, compound 10c revealed Cr–Colh phase transition at 77.4 °C and second endothermic peak
at 143.8 °C upon heating, and on cooling it showed Colh–Cr phase transition at 79.2 °C and another endothermic
peak corresponding to Colh–I traced at 146.4 °C
as evident from the DSC scans. Compound 10d presented
two broad endothermic peaks at 65.2 and 141.5 °C because of the
presence of Cr–Colh and Colh–I
phase transition upon heating condition, and on cooling it traced
at 143.6 and 66.8 °C which is nearer to the observed phase transition
on heating condition. Upon heating, compound 10d exhibited
first transition peak at 65.2 °C and second endothermic peak
at 141.2 °C, and on cooling condition the two endothermic peaks
located at 66.8 and 143.6 °C, respectively. It is observed that
compound 10a displays higher temperature range of the
mesophase as compared to other derivatives. The changes observed in
phase transition temperature of the mesophase due to the substitution
of the variable peripheral alkyl chain in which the methylene group
is linked to each other leads to change in its properties like flexibility,
molecular length, dipole moment, adhesive forces, and polarity, respectively.53,54

POM Study
The
phase transition behaviors of supramolecular
LCs based on the thiacalixarene core appended with thiadiazole Schiff
base derivatives were investigated by polarizing optical microscopy
(POM) upon heating and cooling conditions. From Figure S3, it is apparent that there was no significant difference
in the observed texture characteristic of compound (10a–10d). The defect texture characteristic in all four derivatives confirms
the presence of the columnar hexagonal mesophase. All the thiadiazole-based
thiacalix[4]arene compounds (10a–10d) showed lower
transition and clearing temperatures. The mesophase temperature ranges
for supramolecular compounds (10a–10d) were observed
at 101.3, 77.8, 73.1, and 76.9 °C, respectively. Thus, it is
clear that the presence of the sulfur atom in the thiadiazole and
thiacalix[4]arene core increases the lateral dipole moment that causes
S···S interactions and is responsible for the higher
mesophase temperature range.48 The substitution
of short peripheral alkyl chain length exhibited a higher mesophase
range as compared to other synthesized derivatives. The phase transition
temperatures for all of the compounds (10a–10d) were observed at 102.8, 94.8, 75.2, and 61.6 °C upon heating
and on cooling the similar textural pattern obtained for the columnar
phase was noticed at 101.6, 93.6, 73.2, and 62.7 °C, respectively.
One can see that, with an increase in the alkoxy side chain, the temperature
range of the phase transition decreased and the probability of stereo
heterogeneity increased, which affect its flexibility and weakens
the core–core interaction of the self-assembly of thiacalix[4]arene-based
thiadiazole derivatives. Consequently, an enantiotropic columnar LCs
perceived a good temperature range for the prepared thiacalix[4]arene
derivatives.

XRD Analysis
The liquid crystalline
properties of compounds
(10a–10d) were further explored by using X-ray
diffraction (XRD) examination. All supramolecular derivatives were
examined for their liquid crystalline properties at their transition
temperature observed in POM and DSC analysis. The sample was melted
and filled in the Lindemann capillary tube as an isotropic state and
cooled to their mesomorphic state and scanned for X-ray studies. The
X-ray profile of oxadiazole- and thiadiazole-based thiacalix[4]arene
showed three reflection peaks in the lower angle region and two other
reflections peaks in the higher angle region shown in Figure S4a–d. The X-ray traces of compound 10a at 104.0 °C displayed reflections at 2.62°,
6.20°, 7.62°, 19.92°, and 22.61° in small angle
and wide angle regions. In the lower angle region, compound 10b showed three reflections at 2.46°, 6.26°, and
7.64°, compound 10c at 2.18°, 6.13°, and
7.69°, and compound 10d at 2.11°, 5.62°,
and 7.71° while in the wide angle region compound 10b showed two reflections at 19.96° and 22.67°, compound 10c at 19.86° and 22.63°, compound 10d at 19.92° and 22.54°. The d-spacing value
of compound 10a at the lower angle region was 33.69,
14.26 and 11.61 Å. Likewise, 35.89, 14.12, and 11.58 Å for
compound 10b, 40.52, 14.43, and 11.50 Å for compound 10c, 41.84, 15.73, and 11.48 Å for compound 10d, respectively. The ratio of appeared reflections of all the derivatives
were 1:1/√3:1/√4, signifying the Miller indices [100],
[110], and [200] planes. In the wide angle region, two small diffuse
peaks are found which are corresponding to the packing of alkoxy side
chain shaking of core–core interactions within the column in
the self-assembly. From the literature, similar XRD data were reported
for various columnar liquid crystals based the on calixarene core.40−44 The estimated length of the target molecules is closer to the observed
length of target compounds. Noticeably, the presence of a broad peak
wide angle region indicates definite order in the peripheral alkoxy-trisubstituted
alkyl chain-substituted thiadiazole derivatives inbuilt with the thiacalix[4]arene
core. The possible arrangement of supramolecular compounds to form
the columnar hexagonal shape is depicted in Figure 2. Based on the POM, DSC, and XRD analysis,
it can be noted that all the supramolecular two side-substituted thiadiazole
derivatives adopted a stable hexagonal columnar phase.

of the columnar hexagonal phase
in compound 10c.

Photophysical Behaviors
We have investigated the photophysical
behavior of compounds (10a–10d) in solution and
solid thin films. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of compounds 10a and 10d were measured in different solvents
as given in Figures S5 and S6, respectively.
It can be noted that all derivatives showed the intensities of absorbance
and fluorescence higher in tetrahydrofuran (THF) as compared to other
organic solvents. The moderate behavior of tetrahydro furan can dissolve
a wide range of polar and nonpolar compounds. Thus, the solutions
of all bowl-shaped thiacalix[4]arene derivatives were made in THF
to measure the absorption and fluorescent properties. Compounds 10a–10d revealed the same absorption band at 448, 451,
454, and 451 nm in THF, respectively. The corresponding maximum emission
was observed at 459, 461, 464, and 478 nm as shown in Figure 3a,b. Changes in fluorescence
intensity and absorption peaks were dependent on the solvent polarity.61 The highly delocalized systems with the presence
of Π–Π* transitions and also the presence of sulfur
environment of the thiacalixarene core showed higher absorption coefficient
(ε = 24.9 to 26.3 × 106 L mol–1 cm–1) (Table 2). The solid thin film of compounds 10a–10d presented higher absorption at 451, 454, 459, and 462 nm and higher
emission at 467, 464, 476, and 498 nm as mentioned in Figure 3c,d. The intramolecular charge-transfer
efficiency of synthesized compounds 10c–10d was
higher as compared to compounds 10a–10b suggesting
that the higher alkyl chain substitution with the electron-donating
oxygen atom on the phenyl ring and conjugation with aromatic rings
inbuilt with thiadiazole derivatives on the lower rim of thiacalixarene.
All the synthesized derivatives (10a–10d) showed
dark blue fluorescence in long UV (Figure 3b). The material emitting blue light are
not only limited in blue color but also their energy levels become
very high and they transport an effective fine-tuning emissive wavelength
by combining with an additional dopant emitter to fabricate OLEDs.62−64 All the compounds showed a stable emission band-centered maxima
at 459–478 nm. The present supramolecular thiadiazole Schiff-base
thiacalix[4]arene compounds demonstrated red shift in the absorption
and emission maxima. It has been observed that the variable alkyl
chain on the terminal phenyl ring had no effect on the influence of
absorption and emission spectra. The quantum yields of synthesized
bowl-shaped columnar liquid crystalline compounds in solution and
solid thin-film state were observed in the range of 0.28–0.57
(Table 2). Furthermore,
all the compounds in the solid thin-film state showed lower quantum
yield as compared to the solution state, this is due to the presence
of aggregation in the solid state. The presence of trisubstituted
alkyl chain length decreased the aggregation-caused quenching effect
and enhanced the fluorescence intensity.65

Electrochemical Behavior
Cyclic
voltammetry (CV) is
a type of potentiodynamic electrochemical measurement generally used
to study the electrochemical properties of the molecule that adsorbed
onto the electrode. All the synthesized thiacalixarene-based compounds
were examined for their electrochemical behavior by carrying out CV
studies in anhydrous micromolar THF. Cyclic voltammograms of compounds 10a and 10b with computationally observed highest
occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital (LUMO) energy levels are mentioned in Figures 4 and S7, respectively.
The calculated band gaps, energy level with oxidation, and reduction
potential are mentioned in Table S1.

Figure 4 Cyclic voltammogram
of compound 10a (a); HOMO, LUMO
energy levels of compound 10a by DFT calculation at the
B3LYP/3-21G* level (b,c).

The oxidation and reduction waves of all the synthesized compounds
become similar in cyclic voltammograms. The auxiliary electrode used
in the present study is 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate
in deoxygenated THF equipped with Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 M) reference, platinum,
and carbon working electrode.66 From Figures 4 and S7, it is clearly observed that the compounds 10a and 10b exhibited definite irreversible waves
of oxidation and reduction. The synthesized thiacalix[4]arene derivatives
displayed a lower band gap, which clearly indicates the higher reactivity
of the compounds. This band gap observed for thiacalix[4]arene derivatives
is much less compared to previously reported compounds based on the
4-tert-butyl calix[4]arene core.45,46 The energy levels of LUMO were calculated by ELUMO = −(4.8 – E1/2, Fc,Fc+ + Ered, onset) eV,
whereas the energy levels of HOMO were calculated by EHOMO = −(4.8 – E1/2, Fc,Fc+ + Eoxd, onset) eV.
Compounds (10a, 10b) with lower alkyl side
spacer showed LUMO and HOMO levels as −2.71, −2.73,
−5.82, and −5.80 eV, while higher alkyl chain-substituted
thiacalixarene-based compounds (10c,10d)
revealed the LUMO and HOMO energy levels as −2.74, −2.69,
−5.81, and −5.84 eV (Table S1). The energy level stabilization of HOMO and LUMO has little influence
by the trisubstituted peripheral alkoxy side chain on the lower rim
of thiacalixarene, respectively. Among all four synthesized bowl-shaped
thiacalix[4]arene liquid crystals, compound 10d becomes
more stable because of the existence of a greater band gap. The calculated
values of band gaps by CV were nearly supported by the theoretical
values obtained from DFT. Further, the cyclic voltammograms of compounds 10c and 10d are presented in Figures S8 and S9
(Supporting Information).

Cone Conformation
Study
It is identified that thiacalix[4]arene
derivatives have four main analogues, namely, cone, partial cone,
1,2-alternate, and 1,3-alternate. Compared to normal calix[4]arene,
the four sulfur bridges replacing methylene groups provide various
new characteristics like large cavity inside the core, more flexibility,
greater scope for chemical modifications, and sensor capability.67 Thiacalixarene always adopt the cone shape because
of the formation of the hydrogen bonding between the phenolic groups
on the lower rim and further the crystal structure data are well supported
by XRD studies.68,69 The 1H NMR spectra
of thiacalix[4]arene in CDCl3 suggests weaker intramolecular
hydrogen bonding compared to normal 4-tert-butyl
calixarene because of its enlarged framework. Further, it is difficult
to distinguish exact confirmation of thiacalix[4]arene from cone and
1,3-alternate caused by the absence of methylene bridges in the thiacalix[4]arene
core, respectively. All synthesized thiacalix[4]arene-based compounds
showed cone conformation, which is further confirmed by the 1H NMR technique. All derivatives exhibited two singlets (1:1) for
the −C(CH3)3 group of thiacalix[4]arene
and presence of two singlets (1:1) for the aromatic protons suggesting
the cone conformation adopted by all derivatives. However, the 1H NMR exhibited two other singlets (1:1) for −OCH2- and −CH2O-disubstituted groups on the
lower rim nearly at 4.21 and 4.83 ppm that confirms the existence
of the cone shape by all newly synthesized derivatives.69 The geometries of 1,3,4-thiadiazole thiacalix[4]arene
compounds were evaluated at the DFT level (B3LYP/3-21G*), as given
in Figures S10–S16 (see in Supporting Information). This evidently confirms that all the synthesized supramolecular
derivatives are in cone confirmation. The calculated energies, dipole
moments, and band gaps of compounds 10a–10d are
given in Table 3. One
can see that, the dipole moment and band gap of compound 10d is lower, which indicates its higher reactivity as compared to other
derivatives (10a–10c).

Gelation Studies
The gelation properties of synthesized
compounds were examined in various organic solvents at different concentrations,
respectively. From the four synthesized thiacalix[4]arene derivatives,
compounds 10c and 10d were heated in a glass
sample vial until the solid materials were completely dissolved and
further cooled at room temperature to form gel. Compounds 10c and 10d having two side thiadiazole rings with alkyl
chain inbuilt with Schiff-base thiacalixarenes formed organogels in
dodecane and decane (Figure 5a,b, Table S2 in Supporting Information). This gel formation was possible because of multivalent Π–Π
interactions between the bowl-shaped compounds and the organic solvent.
These supramolecular thiacalix[4]arene-based derivatives were soluble
in nonpolar solvents but formed precipitates in polar solvents, respectively.
Compounds 10c and 10d showed critical a
gelation concentration (CGC) of 1.1 and 1.6 wt % in dodecane while
they showed CGC concentration of 1.5 and 1.9 wt % in decane. In the
present study, it is observed that compounds with lower alkoxy peripheral
side chain stabilized the gel at a lower CGC value as compared to
the higher substituted alkoxy side on the terminal side of the phenyl
ring. To explore the aggregation behavior, thiacalix[4]arene-based
LCs in dodecane to the form network gelator. The further studies of
the gel were carried out by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). From the AFM
study, it is clearly seen that the aggregated molecules form network-type
structures of the nanofiber at lower concentration in dodecane as
mentioned in Figure S17a,b. The morphology
of the obtained xerogels was further studied by FE-SEM. Figure S17c,d represents the SEM images of the
prepared xerogel of compounds 10c and 10d, which exhibits micro and nano thin fibers to give a network structure
of nanofibers. The realignment of the gelator fibers in the supramolecular
structure of the bi-substituted thiacalix[4]arene derivatives in decane
and dodecane clearly indicates the formation of the network structure
in the organogels because of the presence of hydrogen bonding between
−CH=N and −OH groups at the lower part of the
thiacalixarene core. The additional interactions of the sulfur bridge
with nearby hydroxyl groups may thereby induce alignment of fibers.

The presence of peripheral alkoxy
side chain (−OR) creates
van der Waals forces in addition to the intermolecular Π–Π
interaction between aromatic phenyl rings, which is the driving force
for the formation of gel.70 The gel of
compounds 10c (Figure 5a) and 10d (Figure 5b) in dodecane (a1,b1) solvent showed stable gelation (a2,b2) behavior
at room temperature, which further showed fluorescence (a3,b3) on exposure to UV light, respectively. The formation
of organogels was observed within 4.0 min during the cooling process.
Compounds 10c and 10d showed higher emission
intensity as temperature decreases from 70 °C (sol) to 18 °C
(gel) (Figures S18a, S19a). The emission
spectra of compounds 10c and 10d were transferred
from 475 to 491 and 468 to 486 nm, respectively (Figures S18b and S19b). Upon heating and cooling conditions,
compounds 10c, 10d showed the gelation process
in a reversible manner for number of cycles as evident from Figures S18c,d and S19c,d.

Furthermore,
the structure of xerogel in compounds 10c and 10d were studied by the XRD pattern. For the XRD
analysis, the thin film of compounds 10c and 10d were made by the drop-casting method on a glass slide, respectively.
The XRD pattern of xerogel of compound 10c exhibited
several peaks at 2.89, 5.52, 9.08, 14.09, 19.96, 22.60, 24.05, and
27.03 (Figure S20a). In the same way, the
xerogel compound 10d displayed peaks at 2.86, 4.64, 7.18,
11.56, 13.63, 15.98, 20.37, 25.11, and 28.82 (Figure S20b). Thiacalixarene-based xerogels showed reflections
in the XRD state due to the presence of strong intermolecular interactions
between the molecules. Compound 10c showed d-spacing values at 32.76, 20.26, 10.38, 7.05, 4.49, 3.77, and 3.18
Å for compound 10d, 34.06, 20.18, 10.38, 7.05, 4.69,
3.77, and 3.18 Å. The thiacalixarene-based supramolecules in
the xerogel state formed a lamellar type of arrangement confirmed
from the ratio of d-spacing and clearly suggest the
rectangular type of arrangement of the bowl-shaped thiadiazole molecules.
The lattice parameters “a” and “b” of compounds 10c and 10d in the rectangular cell were found to be 65.22, 28.97, 63.72, and
28.85 Å (Tables S3, and S4). The columnar
arrangement of supramolecules in the xerogel state is supported by
the birefringent texture pattern, which represents the occurrence
of hierarchical self-assembly in presently synthesized bowl-shaped
mesogens (Figure S21, see in Supporting Information). These results support the organization of thiacalix[4]arene derivatives
arranged in hierarchical self-assembly given in Figure 6. Here, in the present study, we have first
time demonstrated thiadiazole-substituted thiacalix[4]arene derivatives
as a gelator in the absence of any metal doping to induce gelation
properties on account of the H-bonding interaction.

organogels (10c–10d).

Electroluminescence Study
The fluorescent blue light-emitting
thiacalix[4]arene-based compounds were further studied for their electroluminescence
(EL) performance in the OLED device. The synthesized supramolecular
derivative 10c was selected to study its EL property.
The fluorescence quantum yield of compound 10c was employed
as the emitter with doped and nondoped solution-processed OLED devices
was fabricated with simplified making of the device shown in Table S5. The organic supramolecular compounds
were doped in bipolar CBP to permit host-to-guest energy transfer. Figure S22a represents the architecture design
of the device with the energy level diagram. The EL spectra with current
density–voltage–luminescence characteristics of the
fabricated OLED devices were mentioned in Figure S22b,c.

OLED panels are made from carbon-based organic
materials that emit light when electricity is passed through them.
The emitting light from doped and nondoped emissive layers of the
organic compound in OLEDs may be due to relaxation of electron transfer
from the LUMO state to HUMO state in the molecules, respectively.71−73 The device with different % of CBP and neat state showed good EL
performance. The fabricated device with 1 wt % displayed a power efficiency
(PE) of 0.2 lm/W, luminescence of 438 cd/m2, current efficiency
(CE) of 0.6 cd/A, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.8%.
By increasing the dopant with the device (6 wt %) showed a maximum
luminescence of 314 cd/m2 at 6.9 V with CE of 0.5 cd/A,
PE of 0.2 lm/W, and an EQE of 0.3%. The device inbuilt with a emissive
layer of compound 10c (nondoped) showed a maximum luminescence
of 286 cd/m2 at 7.4 V, CE of 0.6 cd/A, PE of 0.2 lm/W,
and EQE of 0.4%, respectively. It can be observed that the dilution
effect occurs with an increasing dopant ratio with a bipolar CBP host;
it means the higher concentration increases the formation of crystallinity
and self-aggregation organization of bowl-shaped derivatives in the
devices which affect its morphology in the film. The device with 1
wt % doping concentration of dye shows higher maximum luminescence
with higher power and CE as compared to other doping concentration
(Figure S22c).

It is observed that
the higher dopant concentration of blue dye
shows relative low turn-on voltage and higher current densities for
the device. However, the lower luminance value could be because of
the unbalanced charge-transport ratio which results in the leakage
of charge at the interface of electrodes without recombining inside
the emitting layer. The current density versus voltage and luminance
versus current density of all fabricated OLED devices are mentioned
in Figure S23 (see in Supporting Information). All the CBP-based doped (1, 2, 5 and 6 wt %) devices show a bluish-green
EL emission with peaks at 438, 407, 353, and 314 nm. Consequently,
the Commission International de 1’E clairage coordinates (CIE)
color coordinates were (0.24, 0.33), (0.24, 0.33), (0.24, 0.33), and
(0.24, 0.32) while nondoped CBP-based device (neat) also showed the
EL peak at 286 nm and CIE coordinates of (0.24, 0.31). From this,
it can be noted that as the dopant ratio varies from 1 to 6 wt %,
the dye did not display any variations in EL maxima and CIE coordinates
probably suggest that the bowl-shaped molecules become aggregate to
repel uniformly at higher concentrations.74

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed, synthesized,
and characterized
bowl-shaped thiacalixarene-based supramolecular LCs that self-assembles
to form a columnar hexagonal phase with a good temperature range.
All the compounds displayed blue fluorescence in the solution and
solid thin-film state. The self-assembly of supramolecular thiacalixarene-based
mesogens stabilize columnar hexagonal phase with broad mesophase range
and good thermal stability. These supramolecular compounds (10c, 10d) are the first examples of liquid crystals
based on the thiacalix[4]arene core to form columnar self-assembly,
respectively. Also, they possess emissive nature in the gelation state
which makes this research applicable in the fabrication of emissive
displays. The selected supramolecular compound 10c with
trisubstituted octyloxy side chain was used in the fabrication of
OLEDs as doped and nondoped with emitter bipolar CBP. Therefore, these
supramolecular thiacalixarenes derivatives can serve as a good platform
for the development of bowl-shaped LCs used to fabricate OLEDs. Such
multifunctional supramolecular materials should have great potentials
in the search for new thermally stable luminescent columnar LCs and
its applications in displays, photochemical molecular switches, and
gelation, and as chemosensors.
