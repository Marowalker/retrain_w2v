The
precise size control of the lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based
nanodrug delivery system (DDS) carriers, such as 10 nm size tuning
of LNPs, is one major challenge for the development of next-generation
nanomedicines. Size-controlled LNPs would realize size-selective tumor
targeting and deliver DNA and RNA to target tumor tissues effectively
by passing through the stromal cells. Herein, we developed a baffle
mixer device named the invasive lipid nanoparticle production device,
or iLiNP device for short, which has a simple two-dimensional microchannel
and mixer structure, and we achieved the first reported LNP size tuning
at 10 nm intervals in the size range from 20 to 100 nm. In comparison
with the conventional LNP preparation methods and reported micromixer
devices, our iLiNP device showed better LNP size controllability,
robustness of device design, and LNP productivity. Furthermore, we
prepared 80 nm sized LNPs with encapsulated small interfering RNA
(siRNA) using the iLiNP device; these LNPs effectively performed as
nano-DDS carriers in an in vivo experiment. We expect
iLiNP devices will become novel apparatuses for LNP production in
nano-DDS applications.

Introduction
Development of nanometer-sized drug carriers
for nanodrug delivery
systems (DDSs) is expected to improve the biodistribution and delivery
efficiency of drugs and mitigate side effects. Nano-DDS technology
makes it possible to overcome the problems of current DDS-based medications
and provides a breakthrough for next-generation chemo- and gene therapies
including tailor-made medicines.1 Although
several types of nano-DDS carriers2−6 have been developed and showed excellent performance for in vivo and in vitro experiments, lipid
nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most widely used nanocarriers for cancer
treatment.7

The size of the nanocarriers
including LNPs affects the DNA and
RNA delivery efficiency to target organs because large-sized nanocarriers
have low permeability to stromal-rich tumors.8−12 In contrast, small-sized nanocarriers show good permeability
to stromal-rich tumors. In other words, stromal cells surrounding
the tumor tissues are a barrier to the delivery of nanomedicines,
and the interval between the stromal cells depends on the kinds of
tumors. Therefore, precisely size-controlled LNPs, such as 10 nm size
tuned LNPs, could provide size-selective targeting to various tumors.
The LNP size tuning at 10 nm intervals is one of the most significant
challenges in the development of next-generation LNP-based nano-DDS
carriers; however, it has not been achieved in any LNP preparation
methods.

Microfluidic devices enable rapid LNP preparation and
have the
potential to satisfy requirements for both a small amount of sample
consumption and control of the LNP size.13−15 In particular,
the production of LNPs ranging from 20 to 100 nm, which show high
penetration efficiency to the target tumors, was easily achieved by
feeding the mixture of a lipid/alcohol solution and a DNA or RNA/buffer
solution into a microfluidic device.11,16−24 Generally, LNP size is controlled by the flow conditions: flow rate
of samples and flow rate ratio (FRR) of buffer to lipid solution.
According to the literature, the chaotic mixer device is widely employed
for LNP production to enhance the LNP size controllability.21−23,25 The chaotic mixer device has
complicated three-dimensional grooved mixer structures that make the
rapid mixing of solutions possible.26 However,
LNPs easily clog the grooves of the chaotic mixers, and that leads
to stagnation of sample flow. This is the major disadvantage of the
chaotic mixer device for LNP production. Although the chaotic mixer
device shows good LNP size controllability, its mixer design has low
flexibility and robustness, especially regarding the microchannel
aspect ratio, compared with two-dimensional mixer structures. This
drawback affects the LNP size controllability and LNP productivity.27 Moreover, the LNP size tuning at 10 nm intervals
has not been achieved, even if the chaotic mixer device was to be
used for LNP preparation. For these reasons, development of the novel
LNP production platform is strongly desired for production of next-generation
LNP-based nano-DDS carriers, which realize the LNP size-selective
tumor targeting.

In this study, we developed the two-dimensional
baffle mixer device
based on the LNP formation mechanism23,25,28 and a fluid dynamics simulation. We have named the
baffle mixer device the invasive lipid nanoparticle production (iLiNP)
device. It enabled the LNP size tuning at 10 nm intervals in the size
range from 20 to 100 nm, whereas the chaotic mixer could not achieve
the LNP size control. To our knowledge, this is the first report on
the methodology for LNP size tuning at 10 nm intervals. Ten-nanometer
tuned LNPs formed in the iLiNP device make LNP size-selective tumor
targeting possible, and DNA and RNA can be delivered to target tumor
tissues effectively by passing through the interval between the stromal
cells. Furthermore, the iLiNP device had more flexibility and robustness
of device design than the chaotic mixer devices. We also evaluated
the utility of the iLiNP device for production of LNP-based nano-DDS
carriers by an in vivo experiment. Eighty-nanometer-sized
LNPs with encapsulated siRNA, which consisted of a pH-sensitive cationic
lipid, PEGylated lipid, and cholesterol, were prepared with a narrower
standard deviation of size than that of the conventional LNP production
method. The siRNA-loaded LNPs were effectively delivered to hepatocytes
of the extravascular region and showed good FVII gene-silencing activity.

Results
and Discussion
Optimization of the Baffle Mixer Design and
Its Fluid Dynamics
Study
Figure 1(A) shows three-dimensional and top views of the basic structure
iLiNP device. We defined the standard dimensions of the baffle mixer
structure as the width (a) of 150 μm, the depth (b) of 100 μm,
and the interval (c) of 100 μm. When there were 20 sets of the
mixer structure, we called this the basic structure. The width and
height of the microchannel were 200 and 100 μm. The baffle mixer
design is similar to a zigzag-shaped microchannel29,30 and a meander microchannel.31 However,
we found that the optimized baffle mixer structures (width (a), depth
(b), and intervals (c)) only enabled generation of secondary flow
under the high flow rate conditions (>100 μL/min), and this
leads to rapid dilution of ethanol to produce the small and uniform
sized LNPs. Unlike the chaotic mixer device (Figure 1B), the iLiNP device has a simple two-dimensional
microchannel and mixer structure. In addition, the iLiNP device is
expected to provide more effective mixing and dilution performance
at the high flow rate condition compared with the chaotic mixer device
from the viewpoint of fluid dynamics.30

Figure 1 (A)
Three-dimensional and top views of the iLiNP device with the
basic structure of 20 baffle mixer structure sets. Standard dimensions
of the baffle mixer structure were width (a) of 150 μm, depth
(b) of 100 μm, and the interval (c) of 100 μm. The width
and height of the microchannel were 200 and 100 μm. (B) Schematic
illustration of the chaotic mixer device. The dimensions of microchannel
and height of chaotic mixer structure were width (a) of 200 μm,
flat channel height (b) of 79 μm, and mixer height (c) of 31
μm.

To confirm the dilution performance
of the iLiNP device, we carried
out computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and fluid visualization
experiments. Figure 2 shows the CFD simulation results of ethanol dilution in the iLiNP
device at different flow rate conditions. We evaluated the dilution
performance at the cross sections of the narrowed microchannel as
shown in Figure 2A. Figure 2B compares CFD analysis
results between the flow rates of 50 and 500 μL/min at the FRR
of 3. The dilution performance was dramatically accelerated at 500
μL/min, and ethanol was completely diluted within 3 ms. The
rapid ethanol dilution was enabled by the generation of the secondary
flow at the baffle structure, as shown in Figure 2C. The secondary flow was only generated
at the high flow rate condition, and there was no dependency on FRR.
Controlling fluid characteristics is essential for the small-sized
LNP production. According to the literature, small-sized LNPs were
formed under the high flow rate condition and high FRR condition in
microfluidic devices, regardless of the presence or absence of the
chaotic mixers.25 However, we reported
that the dilution performance of the chaotic mixer was deteriorated
at the flow rate of 500 μL/min due to the mechanism of chaotic
advection formation.23 We assumed that
the iLiNP device achieved sufficient ethanol dilution within about
30 ms for producing the small-sized LNPs, regardless of the flow rate
after passing through the 10th baffle mixer (Figure 2B), because rapid dilution of ethanol was
more important than complete mixing of ethanol and saline.25Figure 2D–F shows the effects of dimensions of the baffle mixer
structures where the width was (a), the depth was (b), and the interval
was (c). At the flow rate of 500 μL/min and FRR of 3, the structures
with shorter width (a) and shallower depth (b) dimensions had lower
ethanol dilution efficiency than the baffle structure with the standard
dimensions, even though the solutions were fed at high flow rate. Figure 2F shows the effect
of baffle structure interval on the ethanol dilution performance.
Increasing the baffle structure interval also deteriorated the ethanol
dilution performance; however, the width and depth dimensions of baffle
structures had a bigger effect on the ethanol dilution performance,
more than the interval of the baffle structure.

observation position for dilution performance. (B) Comparison of CFD
simulation results for the flow rates of 50 μL/min (left) and

device at the first, fifth, and tenth sets. Red and blue colors represent
ethanol and water, respectively. (C) Top views of the baffle mixer
region. The flow rate was varied from 50 to 500 μL/min, and
FRR was 3. The arrows represent the streamlines. (D, E, F) CFD results

depth, and (F) (c) of 500 and 1000 μm intervals. Red and blue
colors represent ethanol and water, respectively.

Then, we also performed a visualization experiment23 using a laser scanning confocal microscope for
the basic
structure iLiNP device. We prepared the 10 mg/mL DOPC containing 0.1
mol % Rho-PE ethanol solution and saline and confirmed that both solutions
were completely mixed within 3 ms at the flow rate of 500 μL/min
(Figure 3, inset). Figure 3 compares the mixing
performance between the iLiNP device and the chaotic mixer device.
We used the reported chaotic mixer device,23 and the flow rate was 500 μL/min and FRR 9. The results suggested
that the iLiNP device was able to dilute ethanol more effectively
than the chaotic mixer device at the high flow rate condition. We
considered that the rapid dilution of ethanol using the iLiNP device
made it possible to control the LNP size precisely and produce the
small-sized LNPs.

Figure 3 Comparison of the mixing performance for the iLiNP device
and the
chaotic mixer device (Figure 1B, right). These images were observed at the 1st, 10th, and
20th mixer set positions of the iLiNP device. The flow rate was 500
μL/min, and FRR was 9 (n = 1).

LNP Size Controllability of the iLiNP Devices
First,
we attempted to demonstrate the possibility of the LNP size tuning
at 10 nm intervals using the basic structure iLiNP device. We used
10 mg/mL of POPC solution and saline for the LNP production. The flow
rate was varied from 50 to 500 μL/min, and FRR was from 3 to
9. Figure 4A shows
the LNP size distributions, and the average LNP sizes ranged from
20 to 100 nm. The iLiNP device was able to precisely control the LNP
size, and it achieved 10 nm size tuning of LNPs by changing the flow
conditions and slightly modifying the microchannel design. This result
indicated that the iLiNP device would offer good LNP size controllability
in a wide LNP size range and very limited flow rate range. In fact,
the iLiNP device produced LNPs in the size range of 20–40 nm
at the flow rates of 50, 100, and 500 μL/min and FRR of 9, as
shown in Figure 4B.
Twenty-nanometer-sized LNPs are theoretically the smallest particle
size in the lipid system, and these small sized LNPs would penetrate
the target tissues and organs effectively. On the other hand, the
chaotic mixer device produced the narrow range of LNPs sized from
30 to 40 nm, in spite of the same flow rate conditions.

Figure 4 (A) Size distribution
ranged from 20 to 100 nm for LNPs formed
in the iLiNP device. The flow rate was varied from 50 to 500 μL/min,
and FRRs were from 3 to 9. The sizes ranged from 60 to 80 nm for the
LNPs formed in the sheath flow-type iLiNP device. (B) Comparison of
the size distributions of LNPs formed in the iLiNP device (solid lines)
and the chaotic mixer device (dashed lines). The flow rates were 50
to 500 μL/min and FRR was 9. The Y-axis was
normalized with the maximum intensities of each value as 1.

Figure 5A shows
the effect of the flow rate and FRR on the LNP size. Increasing flow
rate and FRR led to small-sized LNP formation, the same as was observed
for the chaotic mixer device.23 The basic
structure iLiNP device was able to produce the LNPs except in the
size range from 60 to 80 nm by simply controlling the flow rate and
FRR. The standard deviations of LNP sizes produced at the low flow
rate and FRR of 3 were slightly larger than that of the high flow
rate and high FRR. The particle size polydispersity index (PDI) values
were smaller than 0.1 without the LNPs produced at the 50 and 100
μL/min flow rates and FRR of 3. We assumed that the effect of
secondary flow was deteriorated at the low flow rate condition and
it reduced the dilution performance of ethanol. For this reason, the
LNP size controllability was decreased at the low flow rate condition.

Figure 5 (A) Effect
of the flow rate and FRR on the LNP size using the iLiNP
device. The flow rate is varied from 50 to 500 μL/min, and FRR
range is from 3 to 20. For FRR = 3*, the LNP sizes formed in the sheath
flow system are described on the right side. The error bars represent
the standard deviation calculated from repeating each LNP formation
experiment at least three times. (B) The effect of number of sets
of the baffle structure on the LNP size. The numbers of the sets were
0 (no mixer), 6, 10, and 20. Flow rates were 50, 100, 300, and 500
μL/min, and FRR was 9. (C) Relationship between the baffle structure
intervals and LNP size at different flow rate conditions. Twenty sets
of the baffle mixers with different intervals were used for the experiments.
(D) Effect of microchannel aspect ratio on LNP size controllability.
FRRs were 3 (blue) and 9 (red). The error bars represent the standard
deviation calculated from repeating each LNP formation experiment
at least three times.

To enhance the LNP size controllability at the flow rate
of 50
μL/min and FRR of 3, we modified the design of the flow system
from the Y-shaped flow to sheath flow as shown in Figure 5A (right). The sheath flow
system leads to the rapid consumption of lipid molecules dissolved
in ethanol because of the increased liquid–liquid interface
area. We previously reported the effect of lipid concentration on
the LNP size.23 The LNP size was decreased
with decreasing lipid concentration in ethanol. We observed similar
LNP formation behavior by changing the flow system (sheath flow system)
with low concentration of lipid, and we considered that increasing
the liquid–liquid interface area allowed us to achieve the
rapid dilution of ethanol and consumption of lipid molecules. The
improved iLiNP device enabled the production of 60 to 80 nm sized
LNPs with a narrow particle size distribution, and the size standard
deviations also became small compared with those of the Y-shaped flow
system, as shown in Figure 5A. Remarkably, the iLiNP device was able to control the LNP
size range from 20 to 100 nm, whereas the chaotic mixer device produced
LNPs in the size range from 30 to 80 nm at the same flow rate conditions.
These results suggested that the LNP production performance, that
is, the LNP size controllability and productivity of small-sized LNPs,
of the iLiNP device and flexibility of the device design were higher
than those of the chaotic mixer device due to the two-dimensional
simple device geometries.

Effects of the Number of Baffle Structure
Sets and Intervals
on LNP Size
We fabricated other types of iLiNP devices: (A)
the iLiNP device equipped with different numbers of the baffle mixer
structure sets (0, 6, 10, 20 (designated as the basic structure))
arranged at the interval of 100 μm and (B) the iLiNP device
with 20 baffle structure sets arranged at intervals of 100, 500, and
1000 μm. Figure 5B shows the effect of the number of baffle structure sets on the
LNP size. The LNP size was decreased on increasing the flow rate the
same as for the chaotic mixer device and microfluidic devices without
the mixer structure. The iLiNP device showed good LNP size controllability
at flow rates of 300–500 μL/min, regardless of the number
of sets. In spite of the smaller number of sets, 20 nm sized LNPs
formed at 500 μL/min. On the other hand, the microfluidic device
with 6 baffle mixer sets produced the large-sized LNPs at the low
flow rate condition due to the short dilution time of ethanol within
the mixer region.

Figure 5C shows the relationship between the baffle structure intervals
and LNP size at different flow rate conditions. Controlling the LNP
size was enabled by changing arrangement intervals of 20 sets of baffle
mixers. We confirmed that the iLiNP device was able to produce the
LNP sizes from 20 to 60 nm with narrow standard deviations at the
flow rate of 300–500 μL/min and FRR of 9. This result
indicated that the LNP formation process was controllable by passing
through the baffle mixer rapidly, and the baffle mixer was more suitable
for rapid dilution under the high flow rate condition than the chaotic
mixer device was. We considered that the baffle mixer arranged at
a wide interval would also be useful for controlling the LNP size
for other lipid systems including cationic lipid–PEGylated
lipid mixtures at the high flow rate condition because the formation
or aggregation kinetics are different from those of the simple POPC
lipid system. Generally, the aggregation kinetics of the lipid system
are faster than that of the POPC lipid system due to the electrostatic
interaction between RNAs and cationic lipids, the small area of the
lipid headgroup, and the addition of PEGylated lipids. Therefore,
the iLiNP device provided the desired ethanol dilution rate for controlling
the LNP size in a wide range at the constant flow rate condition by
simply changing the baffle structure intervals. Consequently, we found
that the minimum number of baffle mixer structure sets was 10, and
they should be arranged at an interval of 100 μm to satisfy
both the precise LNP size controllability and production of 20 nm
sized LNPs.

Scale-Up Performance of the iLiNP Device
for Mass Production
We demonstrated the scale-up performance
of the iLiNP device for
LNP-based nanomedicine mass production (Figure 5D). Differing from the chaotic mixer device,
the iLiNP device has the two-dimensional simple microchannel geometry.
We confirmed that the dimensions of the baffle structure, such as
width, depth, and interval, played important roles for the LNP size
control. We assumed the height of the microchannel and baffle mixer
structure had good robustness for ethanol dilution performance. Then,
we fabricated the iLiNP device with a 200 μm height microchannel
and baffle mixers. The aspect ratio (height/width of the microchannel)
of the device was calculated to be 1. As we expected from the viewpoint
of fluid dynamics, the LNP size controllability did not change from
the basic structure iLiNP device (aspect ratio: 0.5), and 20 nm sized
LNPs formed at the flow velocity of 417 mm/s. Hood et al.27 reported the effect of the aspect ratio of the
microchannel on the LNP size using the microfluidic device without
mixer structures. Although the high aspect ratio microchannel showed
similar LNP formation behavior to that of the low aspect ratio microchannel,
the microchannels required a high flow rate of the aqueous phase,
namely, FRR of 50 to 100, to produce 80 nm sized LNPs. For the DDS
applications of the LNPs, the content of lipids to DNA or RNA must
be adjusted to the optimal molar ratio to get the best therapeutic
performance. Moreover, DNA and RNA, which are expensive materials
for encapsulation into the LNPs, are dissolved into an aqueous phase.
Thus, the LNP production should be performed at the low and constant
FRR conditions to control the LNP composition and size range from
20 to 100 nm. In contrast, the iLiNP devices can produce a wide size
range of LNPs at low FRR by changing the flow rate.

In the case
of the chaotic mixer device, the deeper grooved mixer structure can
accelerate the mixing performance.32 However,
the LNPs clog the grooves of the chaotic mixers, regardless of the
height of the grooved mixer structure. This is the major disadvantage
of the chaotic mixer device for LNP production. Conversely, we did
not observe any clogging of the LNPs, and there was no deterioration
of ethanol dilution performance in the iLiNP device because of the
two-dimensional microchannel, mixer dimensions, and effective generation
of secondary flow. From these results, we believed that the iLiNP
device would be an ideal apparatus for LNP-based nanomedicine production.

Applicability of the iLiNP Device for DDS
Finally,
we demonstrated the applicability of the iLiNP device for DDS uses.
We used a pH-sensitive cationic lipid (YSK05), cholesterol (chol),
1,2-dimirystoyl-sn-glycero, and methoxylene glycol
2000 ether (PEG-DMG) lipid system for production of LNPs encapsulating
siRNA (siFVII).11 The YSK-LNP performance
was evaluated by FVII gene silencing activity and intrahepatic distribution
of the siRNA via an in vivo experiment. We produced
the YSK-LNPs by introducing the solution of ethanol containing YSK05,
chol, and PEG-DMG and the solution of 25 mM acetate buffer (pH 4.0)
containing siRNA, into the iLiNP device. The concentration of total
lipids was 8 mM, and the molar ratios of lipids were 50, 50, and 1
for YSK05, chol, and PEG-DMG, respectively. Figure 6A compares LNP sizes produced by the conventional
vortex method, the microfluidic device without mixer structures, and
the iLiNP device. In this experiment, we used the acetate buffer solution
without siRNA as the aqueous phase. The iLiNP device was able to produce
the 40 nm sized LNPs with smaller standard deviation of size compared
with the other production methods. We previously reported the 40 nm
sized LNPs formed in the chaotic mixer device at the flow rate of
1.5 mL/min and FRR of 3. However, 40 nm sized LNPs were produced at
the flow rate of 500 μL/min and FRR of 3 using the iLiNP device.
Thus, the iLiNP device achieved one-third sample consumption compared
to the chaotic mixer device.11 This result
indicated that the iLiNP device had sufficient performance to produce
the small-sized LNPs, which can deliver siRNA to hepatocytes.

YSK-LNPs formed in the iLiNP device and in vivo experiments.
(A) Comparison of the YSK-LNP sizes produced by the
conventional vortex method, the microfluidic device without mixer
structures, and the iLiNP device. The error bars represent the standard
deviation calculated from repeating each YSK-LNP formation experiment
at least three times. (B) FVII gene-silencing activity of siFVII-loaded
YSK-LNPs at different doses to mice. N.C.: negative control. (C) Confocal
microscopic images of the mice liver tissues. Blood vessels, LNPs,
and siRNAs were visualized as green, cyan, and red, respectively.

Then, we prepared 80 nm sized
siRNA-loaded YSK-LNPs using the iLiNP
device and confirmed the encapsulation efficiency of siRNA was higher
than 90%. We selected the LNP size as 80 nm because 80 nm sized LNPs
can show both high gene-silencing activity and penetration efficiency.15Figures 6B and C show FVII gene-silencing activity of the 80 nm sized
YSK-LNPs in vivo and the intrahepatic distribution
of siRNA delivered by 80 nm sized YSK-LNPs. YSK-LNPs showed high FVII
gene-silencing activity with no dependency on dose. Furthermore, we
confirmed the 80 nm sized YSK-LNPs showed good siRNA delivery efficiency
to hepatocytes by a confocal laser scanning microscopic observation
of ICR mouse liver tissues. The confocal images indicated that the
YSK-LNPs showed low accumulation in blood vessels, and siRNAs were
specifically localized to the extravascular region where the hepatocytes
were present. From these results, we demonstrated the utility of the
iLiNP device for production of LNP-based nano-DDS applications.

Conclusion
In summary, we developed the iLiNP device for
producing LNPs in
the size range from 20 to 100 nm based on the LNP formation mechanism
and the CFD simulation. The iLiNP device gave precise LNP size control
at 10 nm intervals by changing not only the flow conditions but also
the baffle mixer dimensions. We found that generation of the secondary
flow in the iLiNP device was indispensable for controlling the LNP
size and producing the small-sized LNPs. Twenty-nanometer-sized POPC
LNPs, which are considered as the theoretically smallest particle
size, were formed in the iLiNP device at 500 μL/min flow rate
and FRR of 9, whereas the chaotic mixer device could not produce the
20 nm sized POPC LNPs at the same flow conditions. We demonstrated
the scale-up performance and robustness of the baffle mixer and microchannel
designs. We also evaluated the utility of the iLiNP device for production
of the LNP-based nano-DDS carriers via the in vivo experiment. The siRNA-loaded LNPs prepared by the iLiNP device effectively
delivered the siRNA to hepatocytes and showed good FVII gene-silencing
activity. Differing from the chaotic mixer device, the iLiNP device
showed high flexibility for the LNP production apparatus, because
of the two-dimensional structure, and we could optimize the mixer
dimensions depending on the lipid system. We believe that the iLiNP
device is more useful than the chaotic mixer device to produce small-sized
and size-controlled nanocarriers, not only LNPs but also polymeric
micelles, nanogels, and dendrimers, and we expect the iLiNP device
can be applied as a novel nano-DDS carrier production apparatus.

strand sequences are 5′-GGAucAucucAAGucuuAcTsT-3′ and
5′-GuAAGAcuuGAGAuGAuccTsT-3′, respectively. The Alexa
Fluor-647 (AF647)-labeled siGL4 sense and antisense strand sequences
are 5′-AF647-CCGUCGUAUUCGUGAGCAATsT-3′ and 5′-UUGCUCACGAAUACGACGGTsT-3′,
respectively. 2′-Fluoro-modified nucleotides are represented
in lower case, and the phosphorothioate linkage is represented as
s.

Experimental Conditions for the CFD Simulation
Computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation was used to study dilution performance
of ethanol in the iLiNP device. Concentration profiles of ethanol
were numerically simulated with a three-dimensional model using COMSOL
Multiphysics 5.2 (COMSOL, Inc., Burlington, MA). Physical properties
of both ethanol and water were selected from the material library
(database) in COMSOL. The dimensions of the geometric model for the
basic structure iLiNP device were: 3 mm length, 0.2 mm width, and
0.1 mm height. The device design in the geometric model had ten sets
of the baffle mixer structures. Mesh elements were created by Free-Quad
2D followed by sweeping the mesh elements (2D plane) to create the
3D model, and the size was selected as “Fine” from the
“Predefined list”. The flow model selected incompressible
flow Navier–Stokes equations. The laminar-flow model (no slip
condition) and transport of the diluted species (ethanol) were used
for simulation of the ethanol dilution process in the iLiNP device.
The flow rate ranged from 50 to 500 μL/min, and the flow rate
ratio (FRR; water flow rate to ethanol flow rate) was from 3 to 9.

For the fluid visualization experiment, we prepared 10 mg/mL of
DOPC containing 0.1 mol % Rho-PE ethanol solution and saline. The
solutions were introduced into the iLiNP device at the flow rate of
500 μL/min and FRR of 3. A laser scanning confocal microscope
(A1R, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) was used for the microscopic observation.
The mixing efficiency was calculated by image analysis using ImageJ
(NIH). Fluid visualization in the iLiNP device was carried out at
the same experimental conditions as previously studied.23

iLiNP Device Fabrication
The master
molds of the iLiNP
devices were fabricated by the standard photolithography.34 The master molds were made from SU-8 3050 (Nippon
Kayaku Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). In brief, SU-8 was spin-coated onto
a 3 in. silicon wafer using a spin coater (MS-A100, Mikasa Shoji,
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) to obtain a 100 μm thick SU-8 layer
on the wafer. This was followed by baking at 95 °C to evaporate
the solvent for SU-8. The silicon wafer was aligned with a photomask
and exposed to UV light using a mask aligner (M-1S, Mikasa Shoji).
After baking to get a cross-linking reaction of SU-8, the wafer was
soaked in an SU-8 developer. The replica and molding process for making
the PDMS microfluidic devices (iLiNP devices) was described previously.23

Synthesis of LNPs
We employed two
types of LNP systems,
POPC LNPs and YSK-LNPs. For preparation of POPC LNPs, we prepared
a 10 mg/mL POPC/ethanol solution and saline. For preparation of YSK-LNPs,
a YSK05-based lipid/ethanol solution and 25 mM acetate buffer (pH
4.0) containing siRNA of 0.071 mg/mL were introduced into the iLiNP
device. YSK05, chol, and PEG-DMG were dissolved in ethanol at a molar
ratio of 50/50/1, and the total lipid concentration was adjusted to
8 mM. To make a comparison of the sizes of YSK-LNPs (Figure 6(A)) formed by the conventional
vortex method and two microfluidic methods (one using a flat microchannel
and the other using the iLiNP device), we used 25 mM acetate buffer
not containing siRNA as the aqueous phase. These solutions were injected
from separate syringes (GASTIGHT 1002, Hamilton Inc., Reno, NV, USA)
into the iLiNP device by using syringe pumps (model 100, BAS Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan). The LNP-containing solutions were collected from the
outlet in the microtubes. In the case of the YSK-LNPs, the collected
YSK-LNPs were dialyzed for 2 h against 20 mM MES buffer (pH 6.0) followed
by an overnight dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH
7.4) using a Spectra/Por 2 dialysis membrane standard RC tubing (molecular
weight cutoff 12000–14000 Da; Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho
Dominguez, CA). After dialysis, LNP solutions were stored in a refrigerator
at 4 °C until the size measurement was carried out by dynamic
light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS ZEN3600 instrument
(Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire, UK).

In Vivo Experiments Using YSK-LNPs
We determined the encapsulation
efficiency of siRNA using RiboGreen
fluorescence assay. For the siRNA standard curve, 2 mg/mL of siRNA
was diluted with 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) to 500 ng/mL. LNP solutions
were also diluted with 10 mM HEPES buffer to appropriate concentrations
lower than 500 ng/mL. The diluted LNP solutions were applied to a
96-well microplate at a volume of 100 μL/well. We prepared two
types of 10 mM HEPES buffer containing RiboGreen solutions in the
presence or absence of 0.1 w/v % Triton X-100. Then, the solutions
were added to each microwell applied to diluted LNP solutions at a
volume of 100 μL/well. Fluorescence was measured with an Enspire
2300 Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer, Aichi, Japan) with λEx = 500 nm and λEm = 525 nm after incubation
at room temperature (700 rpm, 30 s). siRNA encapsulation efficiency
was calculated from the following equation.  Triton(+) means the presence of
TritonX-100,
and Triton(−) means the absence of TritonX-100.

Measurement
of Plasma Coagulation Factor VII (FVII) Activity
Four female
ICR mice (4 weeks of age) were purchased from Japan
SLC (Shizuoka, Japan) and intravenously injected with the siFVII/LNPs.
Plasma FVII activity was measured using a Biophen FVII kit (Hyphen
BioMed, Oise, France).

Observation of Intrahepatic siRNA Distribution
ICR
mice were intravenously injected with DiI-labeled AF647-siGL4/LNPs
at a dose of 0.5 mg of siRNA/kg. DiI-labeled LNPs were prepared by
adding 1 mM DiI/ethanol solution to the LNP solution at a concentration
of 40 μM DiI. Fifty minutes after injection of the LNPs, the
mice were administered FITC-conjugated Isolectin B4 (40 μg/mouse),
and liver tissues were collected after a 10 min incubation. Intrahepatic
distribution of siRNA was observed using a Nikon A1 (Nikon Co. Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured by a 40× objective lens.
