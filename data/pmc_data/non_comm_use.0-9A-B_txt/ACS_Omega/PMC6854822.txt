Ferrihydrite/manganese
dioxide composites (FH–M) were synthesized
from ferrihydrite (FH) and manganese compounds by ex situ synthesis
and characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
in the present work. The influences of experimental parameters such
as the solution pH value and initial concentration of adsorbate on
the adsorption uptake of Cd(II)/As(V) was systematically investigated.
The adsorption kinetics was analyzed by fitting quasi-first-order
and quasi-second-order kinetic equations. The results showed that
with increase in the pH value, the adsorption rate of Cd(II) is increased,
while that of As(V) is increased first and then decreased. For the
kinetic adsorption process, the adsorption performance of FH–M
to As(V) was better than that to Cd(II). The quasi-second-order kinetic
equation and Freundlich equation were more suitable to describe the
adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V). The ligand exchange of Cd(II)/As(V) with
the −OH in the composites was confirmed by analyzing the characterization
results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy. The high adsorption ability of the FH–M
makes it a potentially attractive adsorbent for the removal to Cd(II)
and As(V) with a good application prospect.

1 Introduction
At present, heavy-metal
contamination was developed as a global
environmental issue that has attracted great attention from all over
the world. Due to their enrichment, heavy metals in the natural environment
are difficult to degrade. Cadmium (Cd), one of the heavy-metal elements,
is highly toxic and available scarcely in nature, but the development
of human activities, such as mineral mining, fuel combustion, and
sewage discharge, has broken its equilibrium state and caused Cd in
the environment to exceed the standard level. More importantly, Cd
is easily absorbed by plants, and its harm to humans at the end of
the food chain should not be ignored due to its enrichment.1−5 Due to the toxicity and certain properties of arsenic (As), similar
to those of heavy-metal elements, As is generally classified as a
heavy-metal element. As is a trace element in nature; however, human
activities such as fertilization and smelting have resulted in a serious
As contamination, which is already threatening human health.6−8 Exposure of humans to increased levels of As makes them highly susceptible
to cancer, diabetes, and neurological problems.9

There are many methods for removing heavy metals,
such as chemical
precipitation,10 electrochemical treatment,11 ion exchange,12 redox,13 adsorption,14 flotation,15 and membrane separation.16 The above methods have their own advantages, and their
shortcomings are worth mentioning.17,18 Chemical precipitation
and ion exchange are prone to secondary pollution. Electrochemical
methods, redox methods, flotation methods, and membrane separation
methods have high cost problems. In contrast, the use of adsorption
to remove heavy metals is simple and relatively inexpensive. Therefore,
the adsorption method is a heavy metal treatment method worthy of
promotion.18 The key to the treatment of
heavy metals by adsorption is the performance of the adsorbent.

The content of iron (Fe) are relatively plentiful in soils, and
they exist predominantly in the form of oxides, hydroxides, and oxyhydroxides
in natural environments.19 Owing to its
large surface area, high surface activity, and strong adsorption capacity,
ferrihydrite (FH) with an amorphous structure serves as an important
adsorbent in the environment and can control the migration and conversion
of many heavy metals including Cd and As. FH adsorbs heavy metals
by the ligand exchange reaction or complexation reaction.20−24 Actually, the influence of some heavy metals on the environment
depends on their chemical form, which is determined by their valence
state.25 Manganese oxides with catalytic
and redox capabilities can oxidize As(III) to As(V) to reduce their
toxicity.26 Due to the rich structural
defects on the surface of manganese oxide, it has a high surface activity,
which results in manganese oxide having a high adsorption affinity
to Cd(II).27,28 Therefore, manganese oxide plays
an extremely important role in controlling the migration and conversion
of pollutants in the environment.29

Combining the advantages of FH in the adsorption and those of manganese
oxide in the conversion of some heavy metals such as Cd and As is
a good idea or route to solve the environment problem of pollution
by heavy metals. However, there is little work on this subject so
far. Therefore, in the present work, ferrihydrite/manganese dioxide
composites (FH–M) have been prepared for the first time by
the ex situ synthesis method. Then, the microstructure of the synthesized
FH and FH–M as well the adsorption properties of this composites
on Cd(II)/As(V) was investigated. Focusing on the kinetic adsorption
and isothermal adsorption, we intensively discuss the adsorption performance
of the synthesized FH–M composites for Cd(II)/As(V). The application
prospect of the FH–M composite adsorbent and the development
of Cd(II)/As(V) removal in wastewater is pointed out in the end.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Microstructure of Ferrihydrite
and Ferrihydrite/Manganese
Dioxide Composites
The phase composition and surface morphology
of the synthesized samples are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD patterns of MnO2, FH and FH–M samples is shown in Figure 1. It shown that the FH sample
has no obvious diffraction peak, only two broad characteristic peaks
at 2θ of 35° and 62°, which means that the sample
has low crystallinity. This result is consistent with the standard
XRD pattern of FH reported by Schwertmann and Cornell.30 Therefore, the synthesized product is proved
to be FH. The synthesized FH has a large specific surface area (292.632
m2·g–1), which is measured by the
BET-N2 adsorption method, consistent with the results reported
by Schwertmann and Cornell.30 It shown
that MnO2 has only two characteristic peaks at 2θ
of 37° and 65°, the FH–M has two characteristic peaks
at 2θ of 36° and 64°. The positions of the two diffraction
peaks of FH and MnO2 are very close, and the degree of
crystallization of the synthesized FH as well MnO2 is so
low that the intensity of these peak is low and the width is broad.
This explains why the diffraction patterns are similar before and
after compounding in Figure 1, the position of the diffraction peak does not change significantly,
and no new diffraction peak appears. This indicated that the combination
of FH and manganese dioxide did not destroy the original crystal structure
of the FH, and no new crystal form appeared.

Figure 1 XRD patterns for the
MnO2, FH, and FH–M samples.

The SEM images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum (EDS) of the
prepared FH and FH–M samples are shown in Figure 2. One can see that the size
and shape of FH particles vary in the SEM images of Figure 2a, which can be due to the
small size of the FH particles and the presence of agglomeration.
From the EDS spectrum of FH exhibited in Figure 2b,c, it shown that the main elements are
O and Fe, which is consistent with the constituent elements of FH.
The scanning electron microscopy image of a manganese dioxide hydrated
iron ore composite is shown in Figure 2d. Compared to Figure 2a, the particles of the composite surface shown in Figure 2h (high-power SEM
image of composite material) were relatively regular and uniform.
The main elements in the EDS spectrum of FH–M are O, Fe, and
Mn (in Figure 2e–g).
In summary, manganese dioxide is indeed adsorbed on the surface of
the FH.

2.2 Chemical Composition of Ferrihydrite/Manganese
Dioxide Composites before Adsorption
Figure 3 shows the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS)
of the prepared FH–M and those of O 1s, Fe 2p, and Mn 2p electron
binding energies. The surface of the FH–M contains Fe, Mn,
and O elements (in Figure 3a), which is consistent with the previous XRD and SEM-EDS
test analysis results. The binding energies at 725.9 and 712.4 eV
in the Fe 2p spectrum (in Figure 3b) correspond to Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2 of Fe(III) in FH, respectively.31,32 The “satellite peak” present at 719.4 eV is exactly
the same as the characteristic peak of Fe(III) in Fe2O3.3333 This is also consistent with the chemical formula (5Fe2O3·9H2O) added to FH by Schwertmann and
Cornell.30 The binding energies at 654.8
and 642.2 eV in the Mn 2p spectrum (Figure 3c) correspond to Mn 2p1/2 and
Mn 2p3/2 of Mn(IV) in MnO2, respectively.31,32 There is no satellite characteristic of MnO2 in the Mn
2p spectrum. The “satellite peak” present at 645.6 eV
is consistent with MnO with satellite characteristics, which may be
reduced by Fe(III) to Mn(II) during the recombination process. The
binding energies at 530.2, 531.6, and 533.3 eV in the O 1s spectrum
(in Figure 3d) correspond
to O in FM–O (FM represents Fe or Mn), FM–OH, and H2O, respectively.

2.3 Effect
of Initial Concentration on Adsorption
Properties
The effect of the initial concentration of Cd(II)/As(V)
on the adsorption of FH and FH–M is shown in Figure 4. It can be seen from Figure 4 that the removal
rate of Cd(II)/As(V) decreases with the increase of initial concentration
no matter before and after compound. When the initial concentration
of Cd(II)/As(V) is low, the removal rate decreases very slowly. This
result is because the low concentration is still within the adsorption
capacity of FH and FH−M. Once the initial concentration of
Cd(II)/As(V) increases to a certain value, the removal rate reduces
obviously. This is due to the limited adsorption capacities of FH
and FH–M. When the initial concentration of Cd(II)/As(V) gradually
increases, the adsorption site is slowly occupied. However, when the
initial concentration is 50 mg/L, the As removal rate can still be
above 90%. It shows that FH and FH–M have good purification
effect on different concentrations of arsenic-containing wastewater.
In contrast, the removal rate of Cd is slightly lower. However, the
removal rate to Cd(II)/As(V) by FH–M is higher than that by
FH, which indicates a higher adsorption capacity of Cd(II)/As(V) by
FH–M.

Figure 4 Effect of initial concentration on the adsorption rates
of Cd(II)
(a) and As(V) (b) by FH and FH–M.

2.4 Effect of pH Value of Solution on Adsorption
It can be seen from Figure 5a that the adsorption rate of Cd(II) by FH and FH–M
at different pH values (4–10) under the condition of initial
concentration of Cd(II) of 50 mg/L, adsorption temperature of 25 °C,
and adsorption time of 24 h. The figure shows that the initial pH
value has a great influence on the adsorption effect of Cd(II). The
overall rule is that the adsorption rate increases with the increase
of pH value. The results showed that the adsorption effect of FH–M
on Cd(II) was slightly better than that of FH. At lower pH values,
there is a higher concentration of H+ in the solution,
and FH and FH–M will protonate due to the large amount of H+ accumulated around them, resulting in a surface that tends
to be positively charged. A large amount of H+ will compete
with Cd(II) for adsorption, thereby hindering the adsorption binding
of Cd(II) to FH and FH–M. When the pH value increases, the
H+ concentration decreases rapidly and the OH– concentration increases rapidly, causing the charge on the surface
of FH and FH–M to change from positive to negative, and Cd(II)
in the solution changes from the free state to the combined state
after binding to OH–, which facilitates the adsorption
of Cd(II) by FH and FH–M. As a composite product of MnO2 and FH, FH–M has a much higher specific surface area
than that of FH, which greatly increases its exposure to Cd(II). Moreover,
the adsorption performance is promoted due to the high surface energy
and activity of FH–M. Therefore, the adsorption effect of FH–M
is better than that of FH.

Figure 5 Effect of pH on the adsorption removal rate
of Cd(II) (a) and As(V)
(b) by FH and FH–M.

It can be seen from Figure 5b that the adsorption rate of As(V) by FH and FH–M
at different pH values (4–10) under the condition of initial
concentration of As(V) of 50 mg/L, adsorption temperature of 25 °C,
and adsorption time of 24 h. The initial pH value is an important
factor affecting the adsorption effect of As(V). It not only affects
the ionic form of As in the solution but also affects the surface
charge of the adsorbent and the degree of hydroxyl dissociation.34 It can be seen from the figure, the adsorption
rate of As(V) by FH decreases with the increase of the pH value, and
the adsorption rate of As(V) by FH–M increases first and then
decreases with the increase of pH value. Because the surface negative
charge of FH gradually increases with the increase of the pH of the
reaction system. The adsorption point is very limited, and As(V) in
the reaction system generally exists in the form of arsenate anion
(H2AsO4–, HAsO42–, and AsO43–). As a result, with increasing
the concentration of OH−, the competition adsorption
of OH− and arsenate on adsorption points becomes
more obvious. Therefore, the adsorption amount of As(V) in the FH
gradually decreases with the increase of pH value. As for FH–M,
there is a ligand exchange reaction between FH–M and As(V)
anion, and this specific adsorption possess a strong adsorption force.
When the pH is low, the functional group on the surface of FH–M
is mainly Mn–OH2+, which is easily exchanged,
so the adsorption amount is large. With the increase of pH, the group
on the surface of FH–M gradually becomes Mn–OH. Compared
with Mn–OH2+, Mn–OH does not easily
exchange ligand with As(V) anion. Moreover, the increased OH– may also compete with As(V) anions for adsorption. Therefore, the
adsorption rate of As(V) by FH–M increases first and then decreases
with the increase of the pH value.

2.5 Adsorption
Kinetics
To investigate
the mechanism of removal to Cd(II)/As(V) by FH and FH–M, its
adsorption kinetics were analyzed in this section. The adsorption
kinetics curve of Cd(II)/As(V) (in Figure 6) shows that the adsorption trends to Cd(II)/As(V)
by FH and FH–M are identical and can be divided into two stages.
The first stage is a rapid adsorption process. During the adsorption
time, the adsorption rate to Cd(II)/As(V) increases linearly. After
the adsorption for a period of time, the equilibrium is started, and
the change of the adsorption rate tends to be stable, and then enters
the slow adsorption stage. It can be seen from Figure 6 that the adsorption rate of FH–M
to Cd(II)/As(V) is better than FH. The FH and FH–M enter the
adsorption stationary phase after the Cd(II) adsorption increases
rapidly for about 4 h, and are completely adsorbed at 8 h (in Figure 6a). The adsorption
rate of the two increased significantly within 8 h, reaching 78 and
85.9% of their respective equilibrium adsorption rates, respectively.
Afterward, the increased rate slowed down and the adsorption became
stable. The adsorption rates at 24 h were 81.6 and 86.9%, respectively.
The adsorption rate of As(V) by FH and FH–M rises rapidly within
2 h and enters the stationary phase of adsorption after 2 h (FH–M
enters the stationary phase before FH) and is completely adsorbed
at 8 h (in Figure 6b). The adsorption rate of the two increased significantly within
8 h, reaching 93.6 and 94.2% of their respective equilibrium adsorption
amounts, respectively. Afterward, the increase rate slowed down and
the adsorption became stable. The adsorption rates at 24 h were 94.5
and 94.7%, respectively. In the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V), FH–M
enters the stationary phase earlier than FH, which indicates that
the stronger the mineral adsorption capacity, the shorter the time
required to reach an equilibrium.

for Cd(II) (a)
and As(V) (b).

The adsorption kinetic equation
is an important means to characterize
the adsorption mechanism. In this study, quasi-first-order kinetic
equation and quasi-second-order kinetic equation were used to fit
the adsorption process of Cd(II)/As(V) by FH and FH–M, and
the correlation coefficient was used to judge the fitting effect.

Quasi-first-order kinetic equation 1  Quasi-second-order
kinetic equation 2  where k1 (g·mg–1·min–1) is the quasi-first
order reaction constant, k2 (g·mg–1·min–1) is the quasi-secondary
reaction constant, qt (mg·g–1) is the amount of adsorption on the adsorbent at time t, qe (mg·g–1)
is the adsorption amount after adsorption.

The expressions of
the dynamic equations are shown in eqs 1 and 2. The
fitting results are shown in Figure 7 and Table 1. The results show that the quasi-first-order kinetic equation
fits well to the kinetics of adsorption of Cd(II) by FH and FH–M,
which indicates that the equation is more suitable for describing
the kinetic adsorption process for Cd(II). The quasi-second-order
kinetic equation fits well to the adsorption kinetics of FH and FH–M,
and R2 is above 0.9, which confirms that
the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V) by FH and FH–M is mainly chemical
adsorption.

2.6 Adsorption Isotherms
Freundlich model
is the empirical formula for describing adsorption isotherms.35−37 The Langmuir model is the first theoretical adsorption isotherm.35−39 The expression of the Freundlich model35,38 and Langmuir model39 are given as, respectively 3   4  where qe (mg·g–1) is the equilibrium adsorption amount at equilibrium
concentration Ce (mg·L–1), qm (mg·g–1)
is the theoretical maximum adsorption amount of Cd(II), nF is the heterogeneity factor, kF is the
Freundlich coefficient characteristic, and kL is the Langmuir characteristic.

The adsorption isotherms
of Cd(II)/As(V) on the FH and FH–M were simulated using the
Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models (Figure 8). The expressions of the Freundlich and
Langmuir equations are shown in eqs 3 and 4. The fitting results are
shown in Figure 9.
The Langmuir and Freundlich parameters and correlation coefficients
(R2) are concluded in Table 2. The results showed that the
mechanisms of Cd(II)/As(V) adsorption onto FH and FH–M were
consistent with different models. For FH and FH–M, slightly
better fits were obtained using the Freundlich model than those obtained
using the Langmuir model. Also, the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V) on
FH and FH–M belongs to a favorable adsorption situation (nF > 1).36,37 The Cd(II)/As(V)
adsorption
on FH and FH–M can be considered to be a heterogeneous surface
adsorption process. Tang40 studied the
effective removal and easy magnetic separation of arsenic(III,IV)
by superparamagnetic magnesia ferrite nanoadsorbent. The results showed
that the saturated adsorption capacity was 83.2 mg·g–1. Xu41 compared the adsorption behaviors
of Cd from water onto Fe–Mn binary oxide. The results showed
that the saturated adsorption capacity was 114.13 mg·g–1. The maximum adsorption capacity of Cd(II)/As(V) by FH–M
was 144.82 and 180.81 mg·g–1, respectively.

2.7 Chemical Composition of Ferrihydrite/Manganese
Dioxide Composites before and after Adsorption
To study the
morphology and elemental composition of FH–M before and after
adsorption, the FH–M residue before and after adsorption of
Cd(II)/As(V) was also analyzed by SEM-EDS, Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy, and XPS.

The SEM images and EDS spectrum
of FH–M before and after adsorption are shown in Figure 10. FH–M before
the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V) is shown in Figure 10a. The residue after the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V)
is shown in Figure 10e,j, and are designated as FH–M-1 and FH–M-2, respectively.
The results of EDS analysis indicated that the main elements on the
surface of FH–M were Fe, Mn, and O (in Figure 10b–d), the main elements on the surface
of FH–M-1 after the adsorption of Cd(II) were Fe, Mn, O, and
Cd (in Figure 10f–i),
and the main elements on the surface of FH–M-2 after the adsorption
of As(V) were Fe, Mn, O, and As (in Figure 10k–n). The appearance of the Cd(II)/As(V)
element indicates that Cd(II)/As(V) in the aqueous phase has been
adsorbed onto the surface of the solid phase (FH–M). It can
be seen from the graphs that the three elements Fe, Mn, and O are
densely distributed, while the distribution of the Cd(II)/As(V) element
is significantly sparse. This may be because the amount of Cd(II)/As(V)
used in this adsorption experiment is not much, resulting in a relatively
less Cd(II)/As(V) actually adsorbed onto the surface of FH–M,
and thus its distribution is relatively sparse.

Figure 10 SEM images of the FH–M
before (a) and after adsorption of
Cd(II) (e) and As(V) (j). EDS spectrum of FH–M before (b–d)
and after adsorption of Cd(II) (f–i) and As(V) (k–n).

As shown in the Figure 11, FT-IR spectrum of FH–M before and
after adsorption
of Cd(II)/As(V), there are characteristic absorption peaks of water
and OH in FH–M (about 3300 cm–1) and bending
vibration absorption peaks of −OH (about 1650 cm–1).42 The stretching vibration peak of
Fe–O–Mn is about 1400 cm–1.43 Characteristic peaks appeared in the curves
around 1200 cm–1, indicating the existence of Mn–OH,
which is the difference between Mn–OH and water hydroxyl group.43 The absorption peak of FH is about 480 cm–1 in the figure.42,43 It can be seen that
FH–M prepared by this method contains abundant surface groups,
which makes FH–M possess strong chemisorption activity. In
the curves obtained after the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V), about 840
cm–1 absorption peaks appeared. That is, the contractive
vibration absorption of Cd–O and AS–O bonds.44 It shows that the chemical adsorption and co-precipitation
exist in the process of removing Cd(II)/As(V) from FH–M.

Figure 11 FT-IR spectrum
of FH–M before and after the adsorption of
Cd(II)/As(V).

The XPS spectrum before and after
adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V) by
FH–M is shown in Figure 12a. One can see that the surface of FH–M before
adsorption mainly has three elements of Fe, Mn, and O, and the presence
of Cd(II)/As(V) elements was detected on the surface of the FH–M
residue in the adsorption experiment, which also indicates that Cd/As
in the water phase has been transferred to the surface of the solid
phase (FH–M). The Cd 3d spectrum of FH–M after the adsorption
of Cd(II) is shown in Figure 12b and 405.9 and 412.7 eV in the figure correspond to Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 of Cd(II), respectively. The As
3d spectrum of FH–M after the adsorption of As(V) is shown
in Figure 10c. The
44.9 eV in the figure is the characteristic peak of As(V).

of FH–M before and after the adsorption of Cd
or As (a). Cd 3d spectrum after the adsorption of Cd (b). As 3d spectrum
after the adsorption of As (c).

The Fe 2p spectra of FH–M before and after the adsorption
of Cd(II)/As(V) are shown in Figure 13a,b, respectively. One can see that the Fe 2p spectra
of FH–M before and after adsorption are very similar in Figure 13a. The peaks at
the binding energies of 712.4 and 725.9 eV correspond to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 of Fe(III),44,45 respectively. It is indicated that Fe in FH–M before and
after adsorption has a form of Fe(III). One can see that the Mn 2p
spectra of FH–M before and after adsorption are also very similar
in Figure 13b. Mn
2p1/2 and Mn 2p3/2 of Mn(IV) in the characteristic
peak MnO2 of the binding energy of 654.7 and 643.2 eV indicate
that Mn(IV) is always present before and after adsorption.32 As shown in Figure 13c–e, the O 1s spectra of FH–M
before and after the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V), respectively. The
peaks with binding energies around 530, 531, and 532.6 eV correspond
to O in FM–O, FM–OH, and adsorbed H2O (FM
stands for Fe or Mn), respectively.40,46−48 As shown in Figure 13c–e, the percentage of FM–OH is the highest, followed by the percentage of FM–O, and the lowest percentage
of H2O. Among them, the percentage of FM–OH of FH–M
after the adsorption of Cd(II)/As(V) decreased from 61.07 to 51.85
and 52.63%, respectively. Cd(II) interacts with FM–OH, and
As(V) can undergo ligand exchange with FM–OH.49−54 The adsorption pathway of Cd(II) and As(V) onto FH–M is shown
in Figure 14. The
Mn(IV) in the synthesis process of FH–M can be reduced by Fe(III)
to produce a certain amount of Mn(II). Then, some Cd(II) replaces
Mn(II) in Fe–Mn–OH composites, while other Cd(II) coupling
with Fe–OH and Mn–OH form a hydroxy composites. As(V)
usually exists in the forms of arsenate ions (H2AsO4– and HAsO42–), and the arsenate ion acts with the hydroxyl group on the surface
of FH–M by ligand exchange to form a bidentate ligand. Therefore,
the reaction of FH–M with Cd(II)/As(V) consumes FM–OH,
increases FM–O, and forms H2O due to its process,
thereby increasing the percentage of H2O.

Cd(II) and As(V) onto FH–M.

3 Conclusions
FH–M was synthesized by
ex situ synthesis, and the microstructure
as well as the adsorption properties for Cd(II)/As(V) of FH–M
is investigated in this study. The changes of the elements on the
surface of FH–M before and after adsorption were analyzed.
The results showed that with increasing pH value, the adsorption rate
of Cd(II) increased, while that of As(V) increased at first and then
decreased. With increase in the initial concentration, the adsorption
rate of Cd(II)/As(V) decreased. As to the kinetic adsorption process,
the adsorption performance of FH–M for As(V) was better than
that for Cd(II), reflected not only in the time of reaching the adsorption
equilibrium but also the amount of adsorption. The quasi-first-order
kinetic equation can better describe the process of adsorption of
Cd(II) by FH–M with R2 at 0.94,
while the quasi-second-order kinetic equation was more suitable to
describe the adsorption kinetics of Cd(II)/As(V) with R2 above 0.9999. Moreover, Cd(II) was found to interact
with FM–OH and As(V) can be exchanged with FM–OH (FM
stands for Fe or Mn). The FH–M can be applied to the removal
of Cd(II)/As(V) in a wastewater or polluted environment with a good
prospect.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate
(Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and manganese
sulfate monohydrate (MnSO4·H2O) were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Sodium hydroxide
(NaOH) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) were purchased
from Beijing Chemical Works. These above chemicals were analytical
grade (purity > 99%). Sodium nitrate (NaNO3), cadmium
nitrate
tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O),
and sodium arsenate (AsHNa2O4) were guaranteed
reagent (purity > 99.5%). Deionized water was used throughout the
experiments. The standard liquid containing Cd(II) and As(V) in this
experiment was prepared by cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O) and sodium arsenate (AsHNa2O4).

4.2 Ferrihydrite Synthesis
FH was synthesized
by a developed method based on the process reported by previous literature.30,55 The general process is as follows. Forty grams of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in 500 mL of deionized
water. The pH of the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O solution was adjusted to 7–8 using about 330 mL of a 1 mol/L
NaOH solution. Centrifugation after stirring for about 30 min, the
precipitate was repeatedly washed to remove excess electrolyte ions,
dried, and ground to obtain FH.

4.3 Preparation
of Ferrihydrite/Manganese Dioxide
Composites
The synthesized FH was added to the beaker containing
KMnO4 solution, and then a certain amount of MnSO4·H2O was added to the beaker under stirring conditions.
The mass ratio of FH to MnO2 is 9:1. The solution was stirred
at room temperature and then aged, centrifuged for several times,
and dried at 60 °C for 8 h finally. The FH–M was obtained.

4.4 Characterization
X-ray diffractometry
(XRD) is performed on a TD-3500X X-ray diffractometer operating with
a scanning speed of 0.5°/min from 10° to 80°. Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) is performed using a MERLIN VP compact microscope,
and further energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping
is performed in the scanning SEM mode. Nitrogen sorption–desorption
isotherms at 77 K are determined by means of a US Mike TRISTAR II
3020M surface area and pore size analyzer. The relative pressure (P/P0) range of 0–1.0
is selected for the calculation of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements
are conducted on a Kratos AXIS Ultra DLD XPS instrument equipped with
an Al Kα source at 10–9 Torr. The binding energy is corrected
based on C 1s (284.8 eV). The surface functional groups of FH–M
before and after adsorption were determined by Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy (PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR Spectrometer)
in the wavenumber region between 4000 and 400 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. Inductively coupled
plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) (Optima 5300 DV) and
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (ELAN DRC-e)
were used to measure the content of Cd(II)/As(V) before and after
adsorption.

4.5 Adsorption Performance
Test
As to
the effect of initial concentration of solution and adsorption isotherm
on adsorption properties of FH and FH–M, the experiment was
conducted in following steps. Thirty milliliters of different initial
concentrations of Cd(II)/As(V) solution to be adsorbed were placed
in a series of centrifugation tubes. The sample dosage was 1 g/L,
and the pH was regulated by NaOH and HNO3 to be around
7. Oscillations were performed at 200 rpm for 24 h at 25°C in
a temperature oscillator. Then, the supernatant was centrifuged to
measure the Cd(II)/As(V) content, and the adsorption amount of Cd(II)/As(V)
was calculated.

As regards the effect of pH value of the solution
on adsorption properties of FH and FH–M, the experiment was
carried out as follows. Thirty milliliters of Cd(II)/As(V) solution
to be adsorbed at an initial concentration of 50 mg/L was added to
a series of centrifugation tubes. The sample dosage was 1 g/L, and
the pH was regulated by NaOH and HNO3 to be around 4–10.
Oscillation were performed at 200 rpm in a temperature oscillator
at 25°C at different time intervals. Then, the supernatant was
centrifuged to measure the Cd(II)/As(V) content, and the adsorption
amount of Cd(II)/As(V) was calculated.
