The incorporation of a hexadecyl
group on imidazolium, pyridinium,
and pyrrolidinium scaffolds produces low-molecular-weight ionic organogelators
that can gel several types of ionic liquids, deep eutectic solvents
(DESs), and several molecular organic solvents. Minimum gelator concentrations
fall in the 0.9–15.0% (w/v) range, with the lower end of the
gelator concentrations observed in the gelation of DESs. On the basis
of polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry,
and X-ray data, crystallization of these salts appear to produce high-surface-area
crystals, which generate sufficiently stable three-dimensional networks
that are capable of trapping the solvent molecules. Importantly, the
nature of the fluid component of the gel appears to have a profound
effect on the morphology of the crystallized organogelators. On the
other hand, the organogelators appeared to modulate phase transitions
of the liquids.

Introduction
The self-assembly of
liquids into gels, that is, solid-like structures
that possess some fluidity within the solid network, presents an interesting,
intriguing, and useful paradigm.1−3 Gel-based systems have shown to
be viable for various catalytic, energy-related, and environmental
processes.1−3 Although numerous types of molecules (e.g., small
molecule, oligomer, polymer, inorganic materials, etc.) have been
used to induce the gelation of various types of fluids, it could be
argued that the use of low-molecular-weight gelators (LMWGs) provides
maximum flexibility in regard to the manipulation of the structures
of the gelators and gels as well as the properties of the gels for
a better fit for potential applications.3−5

Because of the
tunability of their physical properties via straightforward
structural and functional manipulations of the cationic and anionic
counterparts, ionic liquids (ILs) are unique, versatile materials
that are of interest for many applications.6,7 Imidazolium-based
ILs are among the most versatile and widely used types of ILs, and
they have been utilized in a number of gel-based systems.8,9 Several LMWGs featuring the imidazolium moiety along with either
long dialkyl substituents or dicationic imidazolium-based salts have
been reported to gel aqueous and organic solvents as well as ILs.10−17 Specifically, didodecylimidazolium salts with di- and tricarboxylate-containing
anions were able to gel dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as well as several
imidazolium-, pyrrolidinium-, and ammonium-based ILs with a minimum
gelator concentration (MGC) of 1.2–5.0% (wt).10 In addition, n-octyl- and n-dodecyl-containing bis-imidazolium-based gelators were shown to
gel not only imidazolium-based ILs but also alcohols, such as ethanol,
propanol, octanol, and glycerol, with MGC in 2–20% (w/w) range.11−17 In general, gel-to-sol transitions of these gels were noted in ca.
20–40 °C range as determined by both ball-drop method
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

However, the ability
of a very simple, normal alkyl chain containing
1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium-based ILs to act as LMWGs toward ILs,
for example, has not been explored. Yet, it could be argued that the
simple preparation of LMWGs is one of the main advantages in terms
of the potential applications and utilization. Furthermore, especially
in the case of imidazolium-based salts, the ability to generate a
series of gelators via a relatively straightforward and facile anion
metathesis reaction significantly increases the versatility and scope
of LMWGs. Here, we report a novel ability of cetyl-containing organic
salts, namely, 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium [C16-mim], N-hexadecylpyridinium [C16-py], and N-cetyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium [C16C1-pyrr] (Figure 1A), to gel several representative classes of ILs (Figure 1B), deep eutectic solvents
(DESs; Figure 1C),
and organic molecular solvents.

Figure 1 Structures of compounds used in this work:
(A) N-hexadecyl-containing imidazolium, pyridinium,
and pyrrolidinium
bromides used as LMWGs; (B) imidazolium, phosphonium, pyridinium,
and pyrrolidinium ILs, where X is an anion, e.g., NO3,
PF6, BF4, NTf2, etc.; and (C) DESs.

It should be noted that [C16-mim]-based salts were previously
used either as surfactants or as a part of the gel composites.18−22 In addition, the cetyl-containing, CO2H-functionalized
imidazolium salt [N-C16,N′-CO2H-im]Br
was used to gel a binary (H2O/DMSO) mixture at 20 wt %,
whereas [C16-mim]Br, which was used as a control, failed
to induce the gelation.23 Furthermore,
betaine-ester imidazolium bromide, that is, [C1,(CH2CO2)C16-im]Br (at 21.9–49.3 wt
% concentration), was used for gelation of wet CHCl3; the
MGC for [C1,(CH2CO2)C16-im]PF6 and [C1,(CH2CO2)C16-im]BF4 salts was above 50 wt %.24 Also, [C16-py]-based salts were used
as a component of more complex gelation systems and in the gelation
of biphasic systems.25−27

Results and Discussion
As with many
cases involving LMWGs, we serendipitously discovered
that [C16-mim]Br could gel [C4-mim]Br at 5.1%
w/v concentration (Table 1, entry 1). Interestingly, neither [C12-mim]Br
nor [C10-mim]Br gelled [C4-mim]Br at the same
concentration (data not shown), which suggested that the cetyl substituent
on the imidazolium core could be required to induce the gelation,
and thus we decided to investigate the gelating ability of [C16-mim]Br toward other ILs. Depending on the length of the
1-alkyl substituent on 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolum bromide, that is,
[Cn-mim]Br, with n =
5–9, the gelating ability of [C16-mim]Br was diminished
as the length of the 1-alkyl substituent on the IL increased (Figure S1). Only [C5-mim]Br and [C6-mim]Br formed gels, albeit at a higher concentration of the
gelator than in the case of [C4-mim]Br (Table 1, entries 2 and 3); the rest
of the ILs in this series remained fluid upon addition of 10% w/v
of [C16-mim]Br even after 48 h (Figure S1).

c Solution,
no gelation upon addition
of at least 15% w/v of [C16-mim]Br; TFA = CF3CO2, NTf2 = N(SO2CF3)2, and EG = ethylene glycol.

As bromide-containing imidazolium ILs are highly viscous,
hygroscopic
oil-like materials and are mainly used as precursors for the synthesis
of other ILs, we evaluated other [C4-mim]-based ILs using
[C16-mim]Br as the gelator (Table 1, entries 3–11). In the concentration
range of 5–15% w/v, [C16-mim]Br was able to gel
PF6-, BF4-, and NO3-containing ILs
(Table 1, entries 4–8).
On the other hand, [C4-mim]TFA, [C4-mim]NTf2, and [C6-mim]NTf2 did not undergo gelation
even in the presence of 15% w/v of [C16-mim]Br (Table 1, entries 9–11).
Overall, there appeared to be an intricate balance between the length
of the alkyl substituent and the nature of the anion that modulated
the gelation process of imidazolium-based ILs.

In order to determine
whether other types of ILs could be gelled
using [C16-mim]Br as an LMWG, we examined the gelation
of phosphonium, pyridinium, and pyrrolidinium ILs, namely, [P66614]Cl, [C4-py]NO3, and [C4C1-pyrr]NTf2 (Table 1, entries 12–14), respectively. Although
the gelation of phosphonium and pyridinium ILs was observed, no gel
formation was noted in the case of [C4C1-pyrr]NTf2 (Table 1,
entries 12–14, respectively).

Next, the scope of fluids
that could be gelled by [C16-mim]Br was expanded to DESs,
which have recently emerged as a relatively
inexpensive alternative to ILs.28,29 It appeared that commonly
used DESs, such as l-Pro/OA, l-menth/C11H23CO2H, and ethylene glycol (EG)/ZnCl2 (Figure 1C),
could be gelled by [C16-mim]Br (Table 1, entries 15–17). It is of interest
to note that the MGC values for gelation of DESs were several-fold
lower than those for ILs (Table 1).

Finally, the ability of [C16-mim]Br
to gel molecular
organic solvents was evaluated (Table 1, entries 18–20). Out of the solvents tested,
only gelation of toluene, dioxane, and chlorobenzene formed gels with
ca. 10% w/v of the gelator (entries 17–20). Notably, unlike
previous examples of imidazolium-based organogelators, which were
able to gel DMSO and some alcohols and glycerol,10,12,15 [C16-mim]Br was unable to induce
gel-like formation of alcohols (entries 21 and 22). However, it is
of interest to point out that although EG did not undergo gelation
even when 15% w/v of [C16-mim]Br was used (Table 1, entry 21), EG/ZnCl2 was gelled in the presence of a relatively low amount of [C16-mim]Br (Table 1, entry 17). [C16-mim]Br was insoluble in water, hexane,
and cyclohexane.

Subsequently, the gel phases were examined
using polarized optical
microscopy (POM), and the morphology of the gels was found to be strongly
dependent on the nature of the fluid (Figure 2). It should be noted that the choice for
POM was driven by its least invasive nature, as compared to scanning
electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, for example,
which require removal of the fluid prior to analysis. It has been suggested that the removal
of ILs, which is typically done by using a solvent which is miscible
with IL, for example, but immiscible with the gelator, might compromise
the structure of the gelator.30 Considering
that the ILs (and DESs) and the gelator [C16-mim]Br possess
slightly similar solubility in a range of solvents, removal of ILs
(or DESs) from the gel without disrupting the structure of the gelator
would not be feasible. On the other hand, POM allowed for the assessment
of the morphology of the gels without perturbing the overall structure
of the gels.

Figure 2 POM images of gels of ILs (A–D), DESs (E,F), and
molecular
solvents (G,H) with minimum [C16-mim]Br concentration (see Table 1). Top images: Polarized
light exposure; bottom: direct field exposure. White scale bar is
20 μm.

In the case of ILs, POM
images showed optical anisotropy, which
could be attributed to the formation of ordered crystalline structures;
however, distinct morphologies were observed (Figure 2A–D). Specifically, for [C4-mim]PF6 gel (Figure 2A), platelet-like structure with widths on the order
of 10–100 μm were noted. For [C4-mim]NO3 gel (Figure 2C), clusters of rodlike crystalline fragments with sizes similar
to those shown for [C4-mim]PF6 gel were observed.
On the other hand, needlelike small crystals with thicknesses on the
order of 1 μm were observed in the case of [C4-mim]BF4 and [P66614]Cl (Figure 2B,D, respectively).

Distinct morphologies
were also noted for DES gels, with l-menth/C11H23CO2H exhibiting relatively
large crystalline structures (Figure 2E), while needlelike microcrystals were observed in
the l-Pro/OA solvent (Figure 2F). In addition, because l-menthol is known
to form large crystals, it was possible that the addition of [C16-mim]Br to this DES induced the crystallization of methanol,
which in turn caused gelation. To evaluate this possibility, the gel
was broken up with a spatula, followed by brief vortexing, and centrifuged
to separate the fluid from the solid components. 1H NMR
of both phases (fluid and solid/crystal) revealed that the solid component
was primarily composed of [C16-mim]Br (small amounts of l-menth/C11H23CO2H were expected,
as complete removal of the DES without compromising the nature of
the solid phase was not possible), whereas the fluid component was l-menth/C11H23CO2H (Figure S2). On the other hand, well-defined,
relatively large crystals with similar morphologies were observed
for toluene and dioxane gels (Figure 2G,H, respectively).

Crystalline-like structure
of [C16-mim]Br in various
fluids was further confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements
(Figure S3). The diffractograms of l-menth/C11H23CO2H, [C4-mim]PF6, and dioxane gels exhibited peaks which
were indicative of some degree of order. Notably, however, the crystal
structure of the gelator in these fluids was found to be distinct
form that observed in the case of the neat gelator (Figure S3). This was also supported by distinctly different
crystalline morphologies of [C16-mim]Br that were observed
by POM in these liquids (Figure 2B,E,G). Such structural organization of the gelator
in the gels, likely coupled with high surface area of the crystals
of the gelator, as evident from POM images, might be responsible for
the induction of the gel formation of these liquids. Overall, based
on POM images and XRD data, it appeared that gelator was present in
a crystalline form in the gel, and the specific shape, size, and thus
the morphology of its crystals depended on the environment.

Next, DSC studies were conducted to assess the effect of [C16-mim]Br on the phase transitions of the liquids (Figures 3 and S4–S21, Table S1). In general, the nature of
phase transitions of the liquids (ILs
and DES) appeared to be largely unaffected by [C16-mim]Br,
while additional transitions related to the melting and crystallization
of the gels were noted. For example, in the case of [C4-mim]NO3 (Figure 3A), only cold crystallization (Tc at 22 °C) was noted in the presence of the gelator (bright
blue curve) as well as the melting of the gel (Tm) at 27 °C; yet, the glass transition of this IL was
unaffected during the heating and cooling cycles. In contrast, in
the case of [C4-mim]PF6 IL (Figure 3B), a glass transition (Tg) at ca. −80 °C was observed during
both cooling and heating cycles. The heating curve (pale red) also
exhibited a Tc at −26 °C,
followed by melting (Tm) at 12 °C.
On the contrary, in the presence of the gelator, several crystallizations
occurred upon cooling, that is, crystallization of the gelator (16
°C) and then the IL (−17 °C). This suggested that
the gelator-induced crystallization of the IL and, as a result, glass
transitions were not observed upon either cooling or heating. Interestingly,
upon heating (Figure 3B, bright red), a complex phase behavior was observed at around 0
°C: an overlap of exothermic and endothermic peaks suggested
that as the crystal was redissolving, and another type of crystal
was forming. This indicated that the crystalline phase formed in the
presence of [C16-mim]Br was distinct from the crystalline
phase that was forming upon heating neat [C4-mim]PF6. Such a phase behavior was also noted in a number of other
cases (Figures S4–S20, Table S1). Arguably, these preliminary studies
indicated that [C16-mim]Br might be used to modulate the
phase transitions of some ILs over a wide range of temperatures.

rates were 10°/min. Samples were heated to 70 °C (segment
not shown) and subsequently cooled (blue traces) and heated (red traces). Tg—midpoint of a glass transition; Tc and Tm—maximum
and minimum of the transition.

In order to determine whether the anion of the cetyl-containing
imidazolium salts had an effect on gelation, we prepared a set of
[C16-mim]X, where X = PF6, NTf2,
TFA, and BF4 and evaluated their ability to gel [C4-mim]PF6 (Table S1).
No significant variations in the MGCs or in melting points of the
gels were noted upon changing the anion of the [C16-mim]-based
salts (Table S2). This result was not surprising
considering the common ion effect. Because the amount of the gelator
(and hence the amount of the anion associated with [C16-mim]-cation) was significantly lower than the amount of PF6 anion of [C4-mim]PF6, the gelation would be
predominately governed by the [C16-mim]-cation. However,
the morphology of the resulting gels appeared to be dependent on the
anion of the gelator. POM images of the gels (Figure S22) revealed fairly large platelet-like structures
for X = Br and PF6 and crystalline, rodlike structures
for X = BF4 (Figure S22). On
the other hand, for X = NTf2 and TFA, amorphous morphologies
were observed (Figure S22). Furthermore,
DSC measurements demonstrated that these gels were fairly similar
to the gel of [C4-mim]PF6 formed with the aid
of [C16-mim]Br (Figure 3A), that is, the disappearance of the glass transition,
disappearance of the cold crystallization upon heating, with the appearance
of the cold crystallization upon cooling was observed in all cases,
regardless of the nature of the anion of the gelator (Figure S23).

Finally, in order to probe
the importance of the cation on the
gelation, we prepared N-hexadecylpyridinium bromide,
[C16-py]Br, and N-hexadecyl-N-methylpyrrolidinium bromide, [C16C1-pyrr]Br
(Figure 1A), and investigated
their ability to gel various liquids (Table S3). We found that both [C16-py]Br and [C16C1-pyrr]Br were able to gel ILs, DESs, and dioxane (Table S3). Although preliminary in scope, the
results indicated that the gelating ability of the gelators containing
aromatic moieties, that is, [C16-mim]Br and [C16-py]Br, was slightly superior to the aliphatic counterpart, that
is, [C16-pyrr]Br (Table S3).
It is also of interest to point out that as compared to dipyrrolidinium-based
organogelators,13 the gelation ability
of [C16-pyrr]Br gelator toward ILs was comparable in regard
to MGC as well as gel-to-sol phase-transition temperature. Arguably,
these results further supported a notion that gelation of various
fluids, including ILs, could be achieved with structurally simple
and easily accessible gelators.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, imidazolium-, pyridinium-, and pyrrolidinium-based
salts containing n-hexadecyl groups were found to
be viable LMWGs that were capable of gelling various types of liquids,
including ILs, DESs, and molecular solvents. The gelation ability
of the n-hexadecyl-containing salts appeared to stem
from crystallization of these salts upon cooling, which produced relatively
small crystals with high surface. These crystals of the gelator molecules
may span throughout the mixture, generating a sufficiently stable
network that significantly reduces the fluidity of solvent because
of trapping of the solvent molecules within their three-dimensional
networks. The crystalline network of these novel gelators appears
to induce the gelation of the investigated fluids similarly to fibrous
aggregates of common organogelators. In addition, when compared to
other more structurally complex imidazolium-based organogelators,
both mono- and dicationic ones,10−17 it appeared that the reported novel gelator 1-hexadecyl-3-methyl-imidazolium
bromide, for example, exhibited a similar minimum gelation concentration
range [0.9–11.0% (w/v)] as well as the gel-to-sol phase-transition
temperature range (ca. 25–40 °C). Overall, current results
indicate that structurally minimalistic, easily accessible organic
salts could be used to impart gel-like properties to various types
of fluids.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All chemicals
and solvents were
from commercial sources (Aldrich, TCI, Acros), they were of highest
grade possible, and used as received. 1H, 19F, and 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (400
MHz) spectrometer, and the chemical shifts were reported in ppm (δ)
downfield from tetramethylsilane in CDCl3 or residual solvent
peak in acetone-d6 or DMSO-d6.

Preparation of Gels and Gel Melting Temperature
Measurements
Gelation tests were performed by the inverted
vial method. Briefly,
a screw-cap vial was charged with the appropriate amount of organogelator
and the appropriate liquid (typically 0.5 mL). The vial was capped
and heated using a heat gun until a homogeneous solution was obtained.
The vial was allowed to cool to room temperature, and after 12–24
h, it was inverted to check for any fluids sliding down the wall.
No fluid sliding down the vial’s wall was considered as a positive
test for gelation. Melting points were determined by using test-tube-tilting
method.31 Briefly, a vial containing the
gel was inversely/vertically (or sideways, i.e., horizontally) immersed
into a water bath and the temperature was raised at 1°/min. The Tgel was recorded as the temperature when the
gelled mass started to flow downward. Averages of at least two independent
measurements (the vial with the gel was positioned vertically and
horizontally during the melting temperature measurement) are reported;
the standard deviation (±SD) was less than 2° in all cases.

Phase Transitions of the Gels and Fluids
Phase transitions
were measured using METTLER TOLEDO DSC 1 instrument operated under
N2 atmosphere. Samples (5–25 mg in Al pans, Mettler
Toledo) were heated from 25 to 70 °C at 10°/min (segment
1), then cooled from 70 to −120 °C (segment 2), and then
heated to 70 °C at 10°/min (segment 3). Segments 2 and 3
were plotted in figures of the main text and the Supporting Information. The exact conditions are specified
in the figure captions. For all ILs and DESs, the samples were prepared
in Al pans with a hole in the lids; for toluene and dioxane, DSC samples
were prepared in Al pans without a hole in the lids to prevent evaporation
of the solvent.

Morphological Study of the Gels
POM images were obtained
using a light microscope (Axioskop 40, Zeiss), and images were taken
by a digital camera (AxioCam MRc, Zeiss) and processed using a manufacturer-provided
software (AxioVision AC 4.5, Zeiss). Samples were pipetted from the
vials using plastic disposable pipettes and placed in between glass
slides for visualization.

Powder XRD of the Gelator and the Gels
The samples
were analyzed using the Shimadzu XRD-7000 in the Center for Environmental,
Forensics, and Material Science at the University of Texas at Arlington.
A sample was transferred onto aluminum plates containing 25 mm diameter
divots. Care was taken to ensure that the sample was solely contained
within the divots and maintained an approximately even surface with
the surrounding sample plate. Once loaded in to the XRD, the samples
were rotated at 6 rpm and ran from a 2θ of 2°–50°
at a step size of 0.02° and scan speed of 2°/min with an
X-ray (Cu Kα source = 1.5406 Å) accelerating voltage of
40 kV and current of 30 mA. Scans were obtained in approximately 30
min. After the scans were collected, they were processed using the
MDI Jade 9 software package.

Synthesis of Gelators, ILs, and DESs
DESs were prepared
according to modified literature procedures.32−39 Briefly, appropriate molar amounts of each compound were mixed in
a screw-cap glass vial, capped, and repeatedly heated using a heat
gun followed by short periods (20–30 s) of vortexing until
transparent, homogeneous fluids were obtained. These liquids were
used as prepared. l-Pro/OA:33−35l-proline and
oxalic acid dehydrate were mixed in 1:1 molar ratio. l-meth/C11H23CO2H:36,37l-menthol and dodecanoic acid were mixed in 1:1 molar ratio. ZnCl2/EG:38,39 ZnCl2 and ethylene
glycol were mixed in 1:4 molar ratio.

Imidazolium, pyridinium,
and pyrrolidinium ILs as well as the corresponding gelators were made
according to literature procedures (Scheme S1).40−47 [P66614]Cl was a commercial sample from TCI. All IL samples
were dried for several hours under vacuum prior to the addition of
the gelator. All ILs were purified as follows: ILs were dissolved
in CH2Cl2, followed by filtration to get rid
of inorganic impurities. Next, ILs were repeatedly treated with charcoal
in EtOH at elevated temperatures followed by filtration and removal
of EtOH in vacuo (for an azeotropic removal of residual water). Finally,
the ILs were dried under vacuum for 2–4 h.
